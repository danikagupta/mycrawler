This study was conducted to investigate protective effects of dietary selenium (Se)
on abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino against the toxicity of cadmium (Cd). A 60 ‐day
feeding trial was conducted with abalone (initial weight: 3.17 ± 0.01 g), which wereexposed to 0.34 mg /L of waterborne Cd. During a feeding trial, abalone were fed
graded levels of Se at 0.10 (controls), 1.31, and 4.20 mg /kg diet respectively. Results
showed that there was no significant difference in specific growth rate and survival
rate of abalone among the three treatments. Compared with the controls, dietary Se
significantly decreased Cd concentrations in serum, muscle, mantle, gill, mantle, andhepatopancreas of abalone. Besides, compared with the controls, dietary Se signifi-
cantly increased metallothionein concentration in the hepatopancreas of abalone.
Additionally, compared with the controls, dietary Se significantly decreased concen-
trations of malondiadehyde and protein carbonyl in hepatopancreas of abalone.
Meanwhile, compared with the controls, dietary Se significantly increased activitiesof glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and thioredoxin peroxidase, and
concentration of glutathione in the hepatopancreas of abalone. Based on the data
above, in abalone, dietary Se showed protective effects against waterborne Cd.

1|INTRODUCTION
Heavy metal pollution attracts more attention because of its toxicity,
biological amplification, and bioaccumulation (Duruibe & Ogwuegbu,2007). Cadmium (Cd) is a nonessential metal element, with high toxic-
ity, which tends to accumulate in organisms and is difficult to be
degraded (Maryanski, Kramarz, & Niklinska, 2002). It has been
reported that Cd accumulation in an organism could induce reactiveoxygen species (ROS) production (Galán et al., 2001; Tamás, Valen-
tovicová, Halusková, Huttová, & Mistrík, 2009), and then induce
oxidative damage to lipid and protein (Dandona et al., 1996; Kim, Je,
& Kim, 2007). The oxidative damage induced by Cd is one of the main
reasons for its toxic effects on organisms, such as sea bass Dicentrar-
chus labrax (Liu, Qu, & Kadiiska, 2009). Hence, it is necessary to
reduce the oxidative damage induced by Cd to avoid its toxicity.
Selenium (Se) is an important mineral element in organisms,
which has been considered to be a natural antioxidant to heavy
metal toxicity (Frost & Lish, 1975). It plays important roles in the

metals and then reduce the toxicity (Dabrio et al., 2002; Tran,
Moody, Fisher, Foulkes, & Jha, 2007). In addition, Se is an importantcomponent of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reduc-
tase (TrxR) (Wu, Huang, & Xu, 2003). In organisms, antioxidative
enzyme such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), GPx, and TrxR, and
nonenzymatic antioxidants, such as glutathione (GSH), play important
roles in protecting cells from oxidative damage induced by heavy
metals (Finkel & Holbrook, 2000; Guo et al., 2017). A previous study
has demonstrated that Se plays important roles in protecting rat 's
liver and kidney from oxidative damage caused by Cd exposure
(Ognjanovi ćet al., 2008). Up to now, there are no published data on
the protective effects of Se on the toxicity of Cd in shellfish.
Abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino is one of the most commer-
cially important marine gastropod (Lei et al., 2016). In recent years,
abalone culture has suffered from severe heavy metal pollution and
oxidative damage (Lei et al., 2015; Silva ‐Aciares, Moraga, &
Riquelme, 2013). Hence, it is necessary to improve the capacity of
abalone against oxidative damage induced by heavy metal stress.
The present study investigated effects of dietary Se on heavy metal
accumulation and antioxidative capacity of abalone after waterborne
Cd exposure. It provides basic data for better understanding of pro-
tective effects of Se on abalone under Cd stress.
2|MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 |Experimental diets preparation
The basal diet formulation was based on that of Wu et al. (2010)
with some modifications. The diet was formulated with purifiedingredients (Table 1) to provide 29.41% crude protein from casein
and gelatin, and 3.26% crude lipid from soybean oil and menhaden
fish oil (1:1), which would be considered to be sufficient to maintain
optimal growth for abalone H. discus hannai Ino (Mai, Mercer, &
Donlon, 1995a, 1995b). Procedures for diet preparation and storage
were prepared as previously described (Zhang et al., 2007). Proxi-
mate analyses of crude protein, crude lipid, and crude ash in diets
were conducted following the standard procedures (AOAC, 1995).
The Na
2SeO 3·5H2O was used as the dietary Se source to design
three supplemented levels of dietary Se. They were 0 (controls), 1.5,
and 4.5 mg /kg respectively. The final concentrations of dietary Se
were 0.10, 1.31, and 4.20 mg /kg, respectively, as determined by
hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometer (HG ‐AAS)
(Wang et al., 2012).
2.2 |Feeding trial
Three hundred and sixty healthy juvenile abalone (initial body
weight: 3.17 ± 0.01 g) were collected from a spawning at Laoshan
Fisheries, Qingdao, China. Prior to the feeding trial, animals wereacclimated to laboratory conditions for 2 weeks. Based on the
results of Lei et al. (2015), the waterborne Cd concentration was set
as 0.34 mg /L from CdCl
2·2.5H 2O. The feeding trial was conducted intanks (100 L) in a static water system for 60 days. After measuring
body weight, abalone were assigned to a static water system using a
completely randomized design with three triplicated treatments. Half
of the water in the tanks was exchanged with fresh seawater twice
daily. Each replicate (tank) consisted of 40 abalones. Diets were
hand ‐fed to abalone to satiation once daily at 18:00. Every morning,
faeces and uneaten feed were removed to maintain the water qual-
ity. During the 60 ‐day feeding trial, water temperature was main-
tained at 17 –20°C, salinity 22 –27 g /L, pH 7.4 –7.9, and dissolved
oxygen was not below 6 mg /L. The concentration of Se in seawater
was determined to be 0.46 μg/L. Photoperiod regime during the
feeding trial was 12 hr light:12 hr dark.
2.3 |Sample collection and analysis
Before sampling, all the abalone were fasted for 72 hr. Followingthis, all abalone were removed from the tanks, then weighed (each
replicate was weighted as a group), and counted. Shell, muscle, man-
tle, gill, and hepatopancreas were collected. The muscle, mantle, gill,
and hepatopancreas were immediately washed with cold saline
(0.86% NaCl) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Haemolymph was
obtained by use of syringes and needles from the adductor muscles.
Serum was collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Serum, shell, muscle, mantle, gill, and hepatopancreas samples per
tank were pooled for analysis. The hepatopancreas was stored atTABLE 1 Ingredients and compositions of the basal diet

 GUO ET AL.−80°C. The shell, muscle, mantle, gill, and serum were stored at
−20°C.
The shell, muscle, mantle, gill, and hepatopancreas samples were
lyophilized for 12 hr. Powdered samples (about 100 mg) or 500 μlo f
serum were acidified with 10 ml perchloric acid. Cadmium concen-
trations in seawater and abalone tissues were determined by an
inductively coupled plasma ‐atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP ‐
OES, VISTA ‐MPX; VARIAN, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
The concentration of MT in hepatopancreas was determined
using enzyme ‐linked immunosorbent assay Kit (ELISA Kit; Nanjing
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). A microplate was
coated with purified MT antibody, which was made into a solid ‐
phase antibody. Then, the MT was added into micropore coated
with monoclonal antibody and combined with MT antibody which
was marked by horse radish peroxidase (HRP), resulting in an anti-
body –antigen –solid ‐phase antibody complex. The complex was then
reacted with 3, 3 ′,5 ,5 ′‐tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) after washing
thoroughly. The TMB turned blue due to the catalysis of HRP, and
finally turned yellow under the effect of acid. The OD value was
determined under the 450 ‐nm wavelength. The concentration of MT
was calculated according to the standard curve.
Concentrations of malondiadehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC),
and GSH, and activities of SOD, catalase (CAT), GPx, glutathione S ‐
transferase (GST), TrxR, and thioredoxin peroxidase (TrxP) in hep-
atopancreas were measured according to the methods of Lei et al.
(2016).
Total RNA samples were isolated from the hepatopancreas using
RNAiso Plus Kit (9109; Takara Biotech, Dalian, China). The quality of
RNA was assessed using agarose gel electrophoresis. Single ‐stranded
cDNA was prepared from total RNA by reverse transcription using a
PrimeScripte RT reagent Kit (RR047A; Takara Biotech). Primers used
to amplify the target genes are listed in Table 2. Based on theresults of the previous study (Wu, Zhang, Mai, Xu, & Zhong, 2011),
real‐time PCR assays were carried out in a quantitative thermal
cycler (Mastercycler ep realplex; Eppendorf, Germany) in a final vol-
ume of 25 μl containing 12.5 μl2×SYBR Green Realtime PCR Mas-
ter Mix (Takara, Japan), 2 μl each of primers (10 μmol/L), and 1 μlo f
cDNA mix. β‐actin was used as an endogenous reference to normal-
ize the template amount. Real ‐time PCR temperature profile was
94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 5 s at 94°C, 15 s at 58°C,
20 s at 72°C. To confirm the specificity and purity of all PCRproducts, melt curve analysis was carried out after amplification:
94°C for 15 s and 59°C for 20 s. Fluorescent data were acquired
during each annealing phase. During the detection, each sample wasrun in quartic, and PCR ‐grade water which replaced the template
was the negative control. Results of gene expression were analysed
using the 2
−ΔΔCTmethod according to Livak and Schmittgen (2001).

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS16.0 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA) and Microsoft Excel 2010. Data were analysed by one ‐way
ANOVA. When significant differences ( p<0.05) were found, means
were compared using Tukey 's test. All the data were presented as
means ± SE.
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Growth performance
As shown in Table 3, there was no significant difference in SGR
among three treatments, and the highest SGR was found in 1.31 mgSe/kg treatment. The survival rate had no significant difference
among the three treatments, and the 4.20 mg Se /kg treatment
showed the highest survival rate (93.33%).
3.2 |Cd concentration in organs
As shown in Table 4, dietary Se significantly influenced Cd concen-
tration in serum ( p<0.05), muscle ( p<0.05), mantle ( p<0.05), gill
(p<0.05), and hepatopancreas ( p<0.05). In serum, mantle, gill, and
hepatopancreas, the Cd concentration in 1.31 and 4.20 mg Se /kg
treatment was significantly lower than those in the control treatment(p<0.05). In muscle, the 4.20 mg Se /kg treatment showed the sig-
nificantly lower Cd concentration than the control treatment

3.3 |Concentration and mRNA level of
metallothionein in hepatopancreas
As shown in Figure 1, dietary Se significantly influenced MT concen-
tration in hepatopancreas. The MT concentrations in 1.31 and4.20 mg Se /kg treatment were significantly higher than that in the
control treatment ( p<0.05). There is no significant difference
between 1.31 and 4.20 mg Se /kg treatment. However, dietary Se
had no significant influence on mRNA levels of MT and metal ‐re-
sponsive transcription factor 1 (MTF ‐1) in hepatopancreas.

hepatopancreas
As shown in Table 5, dietary Se significantly influenced MDA
(p<0.05) and PC ( p<0.05) concentrations. The MDA and PC con-
centrations in 1.31 and 4.20 mg Se /kg treatment were significantly
lower than those in the control treatment ( p<0.05). There was no
significant difference in concentrations of MDA and PC between
1.31 and 4.20 mg Se /kg treatment.
As shown in Table 6, dietary Se had significant influence on
activities of GPx ( p<0.05), TrxR ( p<0.05) and TrxP ( p<0.05), and
concentration of GSH ( p<0.05) in the hepatopancreas. The activi-
ties of GPx, TrxR, and TrxP, and concentration of GSH in 1.31 and
4.20 mg Se /kg treatment were significantly higher than those in the
control treatment ( p<0.05). There was no significant difference in
activities of GPx, TrxR, and TrxP, and concentration of GSH between
the 1.31 and 4.20 mg Se /kg treatments. Besides, there was no signif-
icant difference in activities of SOD, CAT, and GST among the three
treatments.
4|DISCUSSION
In the present study, compared with the control treatment, 1.31 and4.20 mg /kg of dietary Se caused a significant reduction in Cd con-
centration in serum, mantle, gill, and hepatopancreas of abalone.
Treatment with 4.20 mg /kg of dietary Se caused a significantreduction in Cd concentration in muscle. Similarly, it has been
reported that dietary Se decreased Cd concentration in the body of
Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) (Abdel ‐Tawwab & Wafeek,
2010). MT is a low molecular weight protein with high affinity for
metal ions, which is widely existed in organisms (Nordberg & Kojima,
1979). It has been reported that MT may reduce toxicity of heavy
metals, such as mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), and Cd, through combin-
ing with them (Dabrio et al., 2002). Moreover, it has been reportedthat Se may induce the synthesis of MT in mussel haemocytes (Tran
et al., 2007). In present study, 1.31 and 4.20 mg /kg of dietary Se sig-
nificantly increased MT concentration in hepatopancreas. It is sug-
gested that Se plays important roles in defending against the toxicity
of Cd, which might be related with MT in abalone.
Studies revealed that Cd stress could lead to overproduction of
ROS in organism, which could damage lipid and protein (Stohs, Bag-
chi, Hassoun, & Bagchi, 2000). MDA is a general indicator for lipid
peroxidation (Gawe ł, Wardas, Niedworok, & Wardas, 2004). Accord-
ing to a previous study, after a 33 ‐day Cd stress, the lipid peroxida-
tion level in liver of Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulates was
increased (Thomas & Wofford, 1993). In the present study, 1.31 and
4.20 mg /kg of dietary Se significantly decreased MDA concentrations
in the hepatopancreas of abalone. Similarly, a previous study on rats
showed that Se significantly decreased MDA concentration in kidney
under Cd stress (El ‐Sharaky, Newairy, Badreldeen, Eweda, & She-
weita, 2007). These data suggested that Se plays an important role
in decreasing the lipid peroxidation level induced by Cd. Besides,
excessive ROS could lead to modifications of nonenzymatic protein,
such as PC, which is considered to be a biomarker of oxidative dam-age (Shacter, Williams, Lim, & Levine, 1994). According to a previous
study, the PC concentration in haemocytes of mussels was signifi-
cantly increased after Cd exposure (Kaloyianni et al., 2009). In the
present study, compared with the control treatment, 1.31 and
4.20 mg Se /kg treatment significantly decreased PC concentration in
the hepatopancreas of abalone. The result is coincident with a previ-
ous study, in which Se significantly decreased PC concentration in
rat erythrocytes after Cd exposure (Soudani et al., 2011). All the data
above suggested that Se play sn important role in protecting hep-
atopancreas from oxidative damage induced by Cd.
In animals, ROS could be removed by antioxidative enzymes
(e.g., GPx) and nonenzymatic antioxidants (e.g., GSH) (Martínez ‐TABLE 4 Effects of dietary selenium on Cd accumulation in tissues of abalone Haliotis discus hannai exposed to waterborne Cd for 60 days

 GUO ET AL.Álvarez, Morales, & Sanz, 2005; Nugroho & Fotedar, 2013). Selenium
is considered to be a natural antioxidant because it is an important
component of GPx and TrxR in organisms (Maleki, Safavi, & Dorood-
mand, 2005; Rotruck et al., 1973). In the present study, compared
with the control treatment, 1.31 and 4.20 mg /kg of dietary Se signifi-
cantly increased the activities of GPx, TrxR, and TrxP in hepatopan-
creas. A previous study showed a similar result that Se significantlyincreased GPx activity in serum of rat (Elboshy, Risha, Abdelhamid,
Mubarak, & Hadda, 2015). Besides, El ‐Sharaky et al. (2007) demon-
strated that Se significantly increased activity of TrxR in kidney of
rats. These results were coincident with the present study. In addi-
tion to antioxidative enzyme, nonenzymatic antioxidants, such asGSH, also play important roles in decreasing oxidative damage
(Nugroho & Fotedar, 2013). Glutathione are considered to be the
most important antioxidant in cytophylaxis (Meister & Anderson,
1983; Segner & Braunbeck, 1998). It has been reported that GSH is
a tripeptide molecule abundant with sulphydryl and it could chelate
with metal ion to alleviate toxicity of heavy metals (Burton et al.,
1995; Foulkes, 1993; Ochi, Otsuka, Takahashi, & Ohsawa, 1988). In
the present study, 1.31 and 4.20 mg /kg of dietary Se significantly
increased GSH concentration in hepatopancreas. Similarly, Se signifi-
cantly increased GSH concentration in kidney of rats under Cd stress
(El‐Sharaky et al., 2007). These data suggested that dietary Se could
reduce oxidative damage induced by Cd through increasing the
activities of antioxidative enzymes and the concentration of nonen-
zymatic antioxidants in hepatopancreas of abalone.
In present study, compared with 1.31 mg /kg of dietary Se,
4.20 mg /kg of dietary Se had no negative effects on ability against
the waterborne Cd. The possible reason was that there might be a
higher Se requirement of abalone defending against waterborne Cd.
It has been reported that dietary arginine requirement of young
grass carp based on ability against waterborne copper (17.26 g /kg)
(Wang, Feng, et al., 2015) is higher than that based on growth per-
formance (13.45 g /kg) (Wang, Liu, et al., 2015). Besides, the dietary
iron requirement of young grass carp based on ability against Aero-
monas hydrophila (87.03 mg /kg) is also higher than that based on
growth performance (75.65 mg /kg) (Guo et al., 2017). Accordingly, it
is hypothesized that Se requirement of abalone under stress might
be higher than that based on growth performance. According to the
previous study, dietary Se requirement based on weight gain was
1.408 mg /kg for abalone (Wang et al., 2012). On the basis of these
data, it is suggested that in addition to the Se that meet the normal
growth, abalone need more Se to defend against waterborne Cd.This could explain that 4.20 mg /kg of dietary Se had no negative

5|CONCLUSION
Generally, the present study confirmed that dietary Se plays impor-tant roles in abalone against Cd toxicity. Firstly, a supplement of
dietary Se decreased Cd accumulation in serum, mantle, gill, and
hepatopancreas of abalone, which might be related to the increased
concentration of MT. Secondly, a supplement of dietary Se
decreased MDA and PC concentrations in hepatopancreas of aba-
lone, which might be related to increased activities of GPx, TrxR,and TrxP, and concentration of GSH. Finally, based on the present
results, 1.31 mg /kg of dietary Se is suggested to help abalone defend
against waterborne Cd toxicity.
