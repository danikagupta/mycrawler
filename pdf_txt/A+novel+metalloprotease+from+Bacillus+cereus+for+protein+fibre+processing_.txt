Abstract
A novel protease produced by Bacillus cereus grown on wool as carbon and nitrogen source was puriﬁed. B. cereus protease is a neutral
metalloprotease with a molecular mass of 45.6 kDa. The optimum activity was at 45◦C and pH 7.0. The substrate speciﬁcity was assessed using
oxidized insulin B-chain and synthetic peptide substrates. The cleavage of the insulin B-chain was determined to be Asn3, Leu6, His10-Leu11, Ala14,
Glu21, after 12 h incubation. Among the peptide substrates, the enzyme did not exhibit activity towards ester substrates; with p-nitroanilide, the
kinetic data indicate that aliphatic and aromatic amino acids were the preferred residues at the P 1position. For furylacryloyl peptides substrates,
which are typical substrates for thermolysin, the enzyme exhibited high hydrolytic activity with a Kmvalues of 0.858 and 2.363 mM for N-(3-
[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Ala-Phe amide and N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Gly-Leu amide, respectively. The puriﬁed protease hydrolysed proteins substrates
such as azocasein, azocoll, keratin azure and wool.© 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The wool surface morphology requires a special wool tex-
tile ﬁnishing process. The cuticle cells (or scales) of wool ﬁbresoverlap with each other forming the surface of the wool. Theyare largely responsible for important properties of wool suchas wettability, felting behaviour, dyeability and printability. Thehigh concentration of cystine crosslinkages on wool surface isa special feature of keratin ﬁbres. Reaction of cystine crosslink-ages with oxidants and reductants are of major importance,being an integral part of the wool chemistry involved in isolatingwool proteins [1]. This component of the keratin structure con-
tributes largely to the physical and mechanical properties of thewool ﬁbre. The hydrophobic character and the exposed edges ofthe cuticle cells are responsible for a differential-friction effect(DFE) resulting in all ﬁbres to move to their root end whenmechanical action is applied in the wet state [2,3] . It is well

Therefore, the most successful and commercial shrink-prooﬁngprocesses are based on modiﬁcation of ﬁbre surface either byoxidative or reductive methods and/or by the application of apolymer resin onto the surface. The most frequently used com-mercial process (the chlorine/Hercosett process) consists of achlorination step followed by a dechlorination step and polymerapplication [4]. Although this process is highly efﬁcient in reduc-
ing shrinking, chlorination produces adsorbable organohalogens(AOX) which appear in the efﬂuent and generate toxicity. Withthe increasing of ecological and economical restrictions imposedto the textile industry, industries are required to ﬁnd environmen-tally favourable alternatives in wool treatment processes [5].I n
addition, coating with synthetic polymers largely compromisesthe natural feeling of wool. The applications of biopolymers hasbeen investigated as possible substitution [6], but until now were
not successful in conferring degrees of resistance.
As an alternative, wool can be treated by enzymes, espe-
cially proteolytic enzymes, in order to develop environmentallyfriendly alternative processes. Enzyme technology, especiallyprotease technology, has been explored intensively [7], alone

or in combined processes [8]. To improve the proteolytic
anti-shrinkage process, different types of proteases have beenstudied. A thermo- and alkaliphilic protease has been appliedon an industrial scale in the pre-washing step of a wool dyeingprocess [9]and a protease from Aspergillus ﬂavus , isolated
from wool, has been examined [10]. Enzymatic processes pub-
lished in the recent years also comprise combined processes.One example is the enzyme incorporated in the alkaline perox-ide treatment, after which chitosan is applied to the wool [11].
However, the major problem in the application of proteases towool is due to the enzyme penetration between cuticle scales intothe interior of the ﬁbre and break down of the cell membranecomplex resulting in an irreversible damage of the ﬁbre [9].
Only very little is known about the speciﬁcity of proteases
toward wool due to its heterogeneous nature and to the amount ofamino acids varying depending upon the source of the wool ﬁbre.
The present study describes the puriﬁcation and character-
ization of new wool-degrading enzyme from Bacillus cereus
with potential application for wool treatment with further incor-poration in detergent formulations. B. cereus is an aerobic,
endospore-forming, mobile Gram-positive rod, but grows wellanaerobically, being commonly found in soil, air and water [12].
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Isolation and selection of the strains
Several different bacteria growing on wool samples [Drummond Parkland
of England, Huddersﬁeld, UK] were cultivated in minimal medium agar platesoverlaid with 0.1 g of wool. The growth was monitored under the microscope,after staining with DAPI (0.1 /H9262gm l
−1in phosphate-buffered saline 50 mM
buffer). The separation of the individual strains was made by platting on StandardI nutrient agar. After separation of colonies the different bacteria were selectedbased on proteolytic activity by plating on the surface of skim milk agar platesconsisting of (g l
−1): 13.6 agar, 4.5 pancreatic digest casein, 2.3 yeast extract,
0.9 glucose and 90 ml skim milk solution (0.1%, w/v). Plates were incubated at30
◦C for 24 h and examined for clear zones around the colony, which indicates
the presence of proteases. For a more speciﬁc selection, the strains with pro-teolytic activity on skim milk agar plates were further cultivated in a minimalmedium with wool as source of carbon and nitrogen (described below).
2.2. Growth conditions
For enzyme production, cultivation was performed in 2000 ml bafﬂed ﬂasks
containing 500 ml of minimal medium with wool as source of carbon andnitrogen at pH 7.0, consisting of (g l
−1): 2.5 KH 2PO4, 3.0 K 2HPO 4, 0.2
MgSO 4·7H2O, 5 ml trace elements Stelkes–Ritter, and 5 g of wool (the wool
was washed and sterilized separately) at 30◦C on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm
for 24 h. The growth was monitored by RNA content and protease activity onazocasein was monitored.
2.3. Determination of the cellular RNA content
The RNA content was measured in order to monitor the bacterial growth
in the presence of insoluble components of the cultivation medium. This assaywas performed according to Benthin et al. [13]. Fermentation broth samples of
10 ml were collected during fermentation, centrifuged in chilled test tubes, thesupernatant was discarded and the cells were frozen for subsequent analysis.The cells were washed three times with 3.0 ml cold 0.7 M HClO
4to destroy the
cell walls of the bacteria. Then, the samples were digested with 3.0 ml 0.3 MKOH for 60 min at 37
◦C with occasional mixing in order to hydrolyse the RNA.
The extracts were cooled and neutralized with 1.0 ml 3.0 M HClO 4. The post-hydrolysis supernatant was collected and the precipitate was washed twice with
4.0 ml cold 0.5 M HClO 4. Finally, the extracts were made up to 15.0 ml with
0.5 M HClO 4and the solutions were centrifuged to remove any non-visible
precipitate of KClO 4that might be in the extracts. The RNA concentration was
determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using average nucleotidedata for calibration [14].
2.4. Azocasein assay
Proteolytic activity with azocasein (Sigma–Aldrich) was determined
according the method of Tomarelli et al. [15]. Azocasein 2% (w/v) was
prepared by dissolving in 50 mM buffer pH 7.5. The solubility of azocaseinbecomes limiting at pH values below 6.0. After the azocasein had dissolved, itwas clariﬁed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×gfor 10 min. The reaction mixture
containing 250 /H9262l of azocasein and 150 /H9262l of enzyme was incubated at 37
◦C
for exactly 30 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1.2 ml of 10%(w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After centrifugation at 8000 ×gfor 5 min,
1.2 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 1.4 ml of NaOH and the absorbancewas determined at 440 nm. Controls were prepared by the same procedureexcept that TCA was added before the enzyme. One unit of protease activity isdeﬁned to be the amount of enzyme required to produce an absorbance changeof 1.0 h
−1, under the conditions of the assay.
2.5. Activity detection by zymogram activity detection
Pre-made, commercially available 12.0% acrylamide casein zymography
gels were used. Gels were inserted into a Mini-Protean 3 Cell apparatus (Bio-RadLaboratories, Inc., Hercules, USA). The chamber was ﬁlled with 25 mM Tris,192 mM glycine and 0.1% SDS buffer. Samples to test were diluted 1 part samplewith 2 parts zymography sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 4.0% SDS,25.0% glycerol and 0.01% Bromophenol Blue) and loaded into the gel. The gelrun at 100 V constant, 25 mA, 80–100 min and ended 100 V constant, 12 mA.The gels were removed from the apparatus and incubated for 30 min at roomtemperature in 100 ml of renaturation buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4)containing 2.5% Triton X-100) on an orbital shaker. The renaturation bufferwas removed and 100 ml of 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mMCaCl
2and 0.02% Brij-35 development buffer was added. Gels were incubated
on the orbital shaker at room temperature overnight. The development bufferwas poured off and the gels were washed with water. Coomassie Brilliant BlueR-250 was added and the gels were incubated on an orbital shaker for 30 min atroom temperature. The gels were distained with 10% methanol, 5% acetic aciduntil clear bands appeared against the blue background.
2.6. Puriﬁcation of the protease
The culture medium supernatant (4000 ml) was pre-ﬁltrated through a
metallic sieve (20 /H9262m) to remove residual wool, than clariﬁed by centrifugation
to remove bacterial cells, and lyophilized. The lyophilized material was dis-solved in 200 ml of 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.5 and frozen. After defrosting,the sample was centrifuged in order to eliminate some polysaccharides thatmight have precipitated. All chromatographic puriﬁcation steps were carriedout using an Aekta Puriﬁer FPLC system (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB,Uppsala, Sweden). Protease activities in the fractions were determined withazocasein substrate.
Samples of 10 ml were supplemented with 0.3 M (NH
4)2SO4and then
loaded onto a Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB;1.0 cm ×2.5 cm) column with a ﬂow rate of 1.0 ml min
−1, previously equili-
brated with 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer containing 1 M (NH 4)2SO4at pH 7.5. The
protein was eluted from the column using 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.5 con-taining 15% isopropanol. The peak fractions (1 ml) with proteolytic activitywere pooled together (10 ml) and then desalted with a Desalting Hitrap
TMcol-
umn (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB; 1.6 cm ×2.5 cm), pre-equilibrated with
50 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 15% of isopropanol. The run wasperformed with a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml min
−1and 0.5 ml fractions were collected.
Positive fractions with protease activity were collected (2 ml) and then 0.2 mlwere loaded through Superdex 75 HR column (GE Healthcare Bio-SciencesAB; 1.5 cm ×12 cm) previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH1774 F . Sousa et al. / Enzyme and Microbial T echnology 40 (2007) 1772–1781
7.5 containing 15% isopropanol and 200 mM NaCl, with a ﬂow of 0.5 ml min−1.
Fractions (1 ml) were collected and tested for protease activity and subjected toSDS-PAGE to conﬁrm purity.
2.7. SDS-PAGE and protein content
SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method described by Laemmli [16]using
12% polyacrylamide resolving gels. Protein bands were visualized by stainingwith Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 Broad range pre-stained molecular weightmarkers (200.0–14.4 kDa) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) were used to estimatethe molecular weight of the protease.
Protein was determined by the Lowry method [17].
2.8. Effect of inhibitors and metal ions on protease activity
To determine the class of protease that yielded the proteolytic activity,
enzymatic extract was pre-treated with following inhibitors: PMSF (serine pro-tease inhibitor), E-64 (cysteine protease inhibitor), Pestatin A (aspartic proteaseinhibitor), Aprotinin (serine protease inhibitor) and EDTA (metalloproteaseinhibitor). After the incubation at 37
◦C for 30 min, the remaining activity was
measured with azocasein assay.
The following metal ions were tested for their ability to stimulate or inhibit
protease activity: Mg2+,C a2+,M n2+,F e2+,C o2+,C u2+,Z n2+. The assay was
carried out by pre-incubation of the enzyme with the divalent cations to a ﬁnalconcentration of 3 mM for 1 h at 37
◦C and thereafter the remaining activity was
measured with azocasein assay.
Enzyme activity measured in the absence of any inhibitor or any ion was
taken as 100%.
2.9. Effect of pH and temperature on enzyme activity and stability
The optimum pH was determined at 37◦C for 30 min. The substrate (2%,
w/v, azocasein) was prepared over a range of pH values between 6 and 12in Britton–Robison universal buffer [18]. Protease activity was measured at
different pH values under standard assay conditions. For pH stability, the enzymewas pre-incubated in the same buffer as above in a range of pH between 4 and12 for 1 h at 37
◦C. Then, the residual activity was determined with azocasein.
Using a standard reaction mixture for azocasein assay, the temperature opti-
mum was a determined different temperature raging from 25 to 90◦C for 30 min.
The thermal stability was determined by pre-incubation of the enzyme at 37
and 50◦C for various periods and then quickly cooled. Standard enzyme assay
was used to determine the residual activity.
2.10. Effect of various reagents on protease activity
The stability of B. cereus protease was determined with the following
reagents: detergents, SDS and Triton X-100 in a concentration of 0.1, 0.5and 2.0%; organic solvents: DMSO, isopropanol and acetonitrile in a con-centration of 1.0, 5.0 and 20.0%; reducing agents: DTT, thioglycolate and/H9252-mercaptoethanol in a concentration of 10.5, 2.0 and 8.0%. After pre-incubation
at 37
◦C for 30 min with the solutions above, the residual proteolytic activity was
measured under standard conditions with azocasein. A control in absence of areagent was taken as 100%.
2.11. Azocoll assay
Proteolytic activity with azocoll (Sigma–Aldrich) was determined accord-
ing the method of Chavira et al. [19]. To 25 mg of azocoll, 5 ml of 100 mM
potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 was added, and equilibrated to 37◦C for
5 min. To this mixture, 100 /H9262l of protease was added and was incubated exactly
30 min at 37◦C in a shaking water bath. Controls were prepared by the same
procedure in absence of enzyme. After incubation, the suspension was immedi-ately ﬁltered through 0.45 /H9262m syringe ﬁlters, and the absorbance of the ﬁltered
solution was determined at 520 nm. One unit is deﬁned as the amount ofenzyme which catalyses the release of azo dye causing an absorbance changeof 1.0 min
−1.2.12. Keratin azure assay
Hydrolysis of keratin azure (Sigma–Aldrich) by B. cereus protease was
determined according to the method of Wainwright [20]. The reaction mix-
ture comprising 200 /H9262l of enzyme solution and 20 mg of keratin azure in 50 mM
sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, in a total volume of 5 ml was incubated at37
◦C with constant shaking over 26 h period. The unreacted soluble substrate
was removed by centrifugation at 8000 ×gfor 5 min and the liberation of the
azo-dye in the supernatant was measured at 595 nm. One unit of keratinolyticactivity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme that led to an increase in A
595 nm
of 0.01 after 30 min under the standard assay conditions.
2.13. Protease assays with synthetic substrates
Activity with pNA substrates was tested at 30◦C in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer,
pH 8.0. The substrate was prepared just before the experiment since nitroanilidesubstrates show varying degrees of autolysis during storage.
The pNA substrates used were: l-Leucine-pNA (1.0 mM), N-Succinyl-
Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNa (1.0 mM), N-Succinyl-Gly-Gly-Phe-pNA (3.0 mM),
N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA (3.0 mM), N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA
(1.0 mM), N-Succinyl-Gly-Gly-Gly-pNA (2.5 mM), Sar-Pro-Arg-pNA dihy-
drochloride (3.0 mM) and BAPNA (3.0 mM). The increase in absorbance due tothe hydrolysis and release of p-nitroanilide was measured at 400 nm. Extinction
coefﬁcient ( ε) was taken to be 10500 M
−1cm−1at pH 8.0. One unit of activity is
deﬁned as the amount of the enzyme that catalysis the transformation of 1 /H9262mol
substrate per minute.
Hydrolytic activity of B. cereus protease with esters substrates was
performed at 30◦C in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The substrates
with the respective concentration used for the activity were: BAEE,4.0 mM ( ε
253= 1150 M−1cm−1); BTEE, 2.0 mM ( ε256= 964 M−1cm−1);
ATEE, 3.0 mM ( ε237=−0.0075 ml /H9262mol−1cm−1); 4-nitrophenyl acetate and 4-
nitrophenyl butyrate, 2.0 mM ( ε405= 9.36 ml /H9262mol−1cm−1). One unit of activity
is deﬁned as the amount of the enzyme that splits of 1 /H9262mol substrate per minute.
Protease activity using furylacryloylpeptidyl amides was determined accord-
ing to the method described by Feder et al. [21]. The assay was carried out using
100/H9262l of enzyme solution and 1 mM of substrate at 30◦C. The stock solution
(10 mM) of the substrates was prepared by adding DMSO in a sufﬁcient amountfor dissolving the substrates and then the ﬁnal volume was done with 50 mMTris–HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mM Mes, 2 mM CaCl
2and 0.01% Triton-
X-100. The absorbance was recorded by continuously monitoring the decreaseat 340 nm for 5 min. The extinction coefﬁcients were ε
340=−0.600 ml /H9262mol−1
for N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Ala-Phe amide and ε340=−0.359 m /H9262mol−1.
2.14. Determination of the kinetic parameters
The kinetic parameters were determined for the following substrates: l-
Leucine-pNA (0.05–1.0 mM), N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNa (0.1–1.0 mM),
N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA (0.4–2.5 mM), N-Succinyl-Gly-Gly-Gly-
pNA (0.4–2.5 mM), N-Succinyl-Gly-Gly-Phe-pNA (0.8–4.0 mM), N-(3-[2-
Furyl]acryloyl)-Gly-Leu amide (0.05-1.0 mM) and N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-
Ala-Phe amide (0.05–1.0 mM).
The kinetic studies were performed in triplicate and the data obtained ﬁtted
to the Michaelis–Menten equation. The Kmand Vmaxvalues were determined
through non-linear regression analysis using the program Origin 5.0.
2.15. Determination inhibition kinetics
The inhibition kinetics were carried out with N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Ala-
Phe amide substrate at different inhibitor (EDTA) concentrations. The enzyme-catalysed hydrolysis of the substrate (1 mM) was followed in the absence ofEDTA to establish the inhibited rate of substrate hydrolysis ( V
0). The inhibitor,
EDTA was added in no more than 5% of the total assay volume. The reactionwas allowed to procedure until the rate of hydrolysis has relaxed to a new steadystate, thus establishing the inhibition rate ( V
i). The substrate concentration was
kept constant, by not allowing more than 5% hydrolysis. To have more accurateresults, the experiment was repeated with several different concentrations ofEDTA (0.001–0.3 mM).F . Sousa et al. / Enzyme and Microbial T echnology 40 (2007) 1772–1781 1775

2.16. Determination of the speciﬁcity of B. cereus protease
The proteolytic speciﬁcity of B. cereus protease was determined by analysis
of the peptides obtained after incubation with the oxidized insulin B-chain assubstrate.

investigated using an enzyme-substrate in a molar ratio of 1:100. The insulinwas dissolved in 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.5, and then the protease wasadded. Samples were taken at different times, 30 min, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. Afterincubation, the reaction 40 /H9262l of 0.1% TFA was added to inactivate the enzyme.
Identiﬁcation of the cleavage products were analysed by MALDI-TOF massspectrometry and identiﬁed from their corresponding molecular masses. Thecleavage was determined according Schecher and Berger [22].
2.17. MALDI-TOF
The digest of oxidized insulin B-chain by B. cereus protease was diluted
1:10 in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid and mixed 1:1 witha 5 mg ml
−1solution of /H9251-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma–Aldrich) in
50% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid. One microlitre of the sampleswere spotted onto a stainless steel target MALDI plate and air-dried beforeanalysis in the mass spectrometer. Identiﬁcation of the cleavage products wasperformed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization reﬂectron-type time-of-ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Waters
®Micromass®MALDI
micro MX, Manchester, UK), equipped with a 337 nm nitrogen laser. Spec-tra were acquired in the reﬂectron positive mode and calibration was carriedout using a mixture of PEG oligomers. Cleavage sites were identiﬁed using theExPASy tool ﬁndpept.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Isolation and screening of microorganisms
From the 30 bacterial strains isolated from wool ( Fig. 1 ),
one strain was selected based on the proteolytic activity pro-duced in skim milk agar plates and growth in a minimal mediumwith wool as the only source of carbon and nitrogen. Based on

the relationship between the level of protease production and
growth, the selected microorganism was identiﬁed as B. cereus
(DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). B. cereus is a ubiquitous
Gram-positive, spore-forming, motile rod, commonly found insoil, plant material, hay, raw and processed food. It is also fre-quently found in pasteurised milk, causing spoilage because ofthe production of lipases and proteases [23].B. cereus grew and
produced a protease using wool as sole of carbon and nitrogen(Fig. 2 ). Complete degradation of wool protein was observed
after 55 h, indicating that wool was used as an inducer for pro-tease production. Peptides or proteins have been reported toincrease proteases synthesis in a number of microorganisms[24]. The maximum enzyme activity was reached after 24 h incu-
bation and prolongation of the fermentation was accompaniedwith a gradual decrease of enzyme activity. From the growthcurve of B. cereus based on the RNA content, it can be seen that
protease production is correlated with growth. Secretion of pro-teases has been linked to the bacterial growth either associatedwith the growth or with stationary phase, with greatest expres-sion of protease during the stationary phase, when sporulationalso occurs [28]. To determine the number of proteases produced
byB. cereus , an SDS-PAGE on a gel that was copolymerised
with casein (zymogram) was performed ( Fig. 3 a). Extracellular
proteases are common among Bacillus genus. However, in con-
trast to other Bacillus sp., B. cereus according to zymography,
the presence of a single clear zone in the blue background sug-gests that the crude ﬁltrate of B. cereus mainly contains a single
protease.
B. cereus protease was puriﬁed to electrophoretic homogene-
ity by the combination of three chromatographic steps. In theﬁrst step using hydrophobic interaction chromatography, 98%of original protein was removed ( Table 1 ). From the puriﬁcation

table, the protease was puriﬁed to 57.6-fold with a 2.16% yield.
The speciﬁc activity of the ﬁnal enzyme preparation was esti-mated to be 122.7 nKat mg
−1. In gel ﬁltration chromatography,
proteolytic activity was detected in a single peak correspond-ing and SDS-PAGE showed the homogeneity of the puriﬁedenzyme with a molecular weight of 45.6 ±1.7 kDa ( Fig. 3 b). The
molecular weight of B. cereus protease is in agreement with data
from the literature indicating the molecular masses of previouslyworks found proteases are rarely more than 50 kDa [25–27] .
3.2. Biochemical characterization
The optimum pH of B. cereus protease at 37
◦C was deter-
mined to be 7.0. Bacteria of the Bacillus genus secrete mostly
two types of extracellular proteases, a neutral or metallopro-tease, and an alkaline protease which is functionally a serineendopeptidase, referred to as subtilisin. The ﬁrst exhibit optimalpH at 7.0, whereas the latter have pH optima between 9 and 11[31]. The protease from B. cereus belongs to the ﬁrst group since
the optimum pH was 7.0. However, this protease has new char-acteristics when compared to the others produced by B. cereus
until now published.
The enzyme has a temperature optimum at 45
◦C and retains
55% of activity at 50◦C after 2 h incubation (the half-life time at
50◦C was 2 h) and is stable in a wide range of pH, retaining 85%
of its original activity between pH 6 and 9 after 1 h at 37◦C. At
pH 5, the half-life time (37◦C) was 1 h.
In addition, the biochemical characterization and inhibition
pattern provides clear results for the classiﬁcation of the proteaseproduced by B. cereus . The serine protease inhibitors (apro-
tinin and PMSF), cysteine protease inhibitor (E-64) and asparticprotease inhibitor (pepstatin) were ineffective as inhibitors.
However, the metal chelators 1,10-phenantroline and EDTAcaused 100% inactivation of enzyme. The strong inhibitionobserved against these inhibitors demonstrates that the puri-ﬁed protease is a metalloprotease (the results are summarizedinTable 2 ). This was conﬁrmed by studying the effect of EDTA
on enzyme inhibition (data not shown) in which the enzyme isinhibited by even with low concentrations of EDTA, showingthat 0.25 mM EDTA was needed to cause 50% drop ( I

alloproteases and suggests that in the B. cereus , unlike Bacillus
subtillis , proteolytic activity when grown on wool is a result of
neutral protease.
Calcium ions were found to enhance protease activity, achiev-
ing its maximum activity at a concentration of 10 mM, whileCu
2+decreased the activity to 5.5% (see Table 2 ). These results
indicated that the enzyme require Ca2+for its optimal activity.
Since Ca2+is the best inducer, the effect of its concentration
on protease activity and the maximum activity was obtainedwith 10 mM Ca
2+(data not shown). The effect of Ca2+on the
protease under investigation may involve stabilization of theenzyme molecule structure. Calcium cations are known to be sta-bilizers of many enzymes, protecting them from conformationalchanges. The Ca
2+binding sites examined for some bacterial
proteases contain a number of co-coordinating aspartate andglutamate residues [29].
Several reports show that proteolytic activity could be
enhanced by the addition of organic solvents in the reactionmixture [30]. However, enzymes are usually inactivated or dena-
tured in the presence of organic solvents. The protease showedgood stability in the presence of DMSO (20 mM) and acetoni-trile (1 mM), since the activity increase approximately 5 and3%, respectively, when compared to the enzyme in the absenceof an organic solvent (see Table 3 ). The protease activity was
rapidly inhibited in presence of 2% SDS; however, showed

and 45% of its initial activity, respectively, above these concen-trations the enzyme was rapidly inhibited. From our study, it canbe concluded that the stability of B. cereus protease depends on
the nature of organic solvents, as well as the nature of deter-gents. This means that replacement of some water moleculesin an enzyme with organic molecules sometimes stabilizes thestructure of the enzyme [31]. A similar increase in protease activ-
ity from P . aeruginosa PST-01 was also reported by Ogino et
al.[32] when the enzyme was pre-incubated in the presence of
water miscible organic solvents.
3.3. Hydrolysis of various protein substrates
The activity of B. cereus protease was tested with differ-
ent soluble and insoluble proteinaceous substrates at 37
◦C
for 30 min. The enzyme hydrolysed azocasein and azocollefﬁciently, exhibiting 216.04 and 355.63 nKat mg
−1, respec-
tively, under similar conditions. The keratinolytic activity12.45 nKat mg
−1was signiﬁcantly lower than the obtained with
the other protein substrates.
3.4. Determination of the cleavage speciﬁcity
The proteolytic speciﬁcity of B. cereus protease was deter-
mined by analysis of the peptides obtained after incubation withthe oxidized insulin B-chain as substrate. Cleavage of oxidizedinsulin B-chain by the B. cereus protease at 37
◦C was inves-
tigated using an enzyme-substrate in a molar ratio of 1:100.The reaction products after incubation from 30 min up to 24 hwere analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and iden-tiﬁed from their corresponding molecular masses. From thepeptides obtained after the hydrolysis of the oxidized insulinB-chain by B. cereus protease, the enzyme showed endopep-
tidase activity and a broad speciﬁcity, a total of seven peptidebonds in the B-chain of insulin were hydrolysed ( Fig. 4 ). The
complete hydrolysis was reached after 12 h incubation, howeverall larger cleavages were detected after 30 min incubation. The

major requirement is that a hydrophobic residue such as Leu, Val
or Ala should participate with the N-amino group in the bondto be cleaved. However, hydrolysis of bonds at the N-terminalside of His, Cys and Glu was also observed. The residue in thebond by the carboxyl group may have a stimulating effect; thecleavage is favoured with polar groups at the N-terminal. Thiscleavage is different from other metalloproteases reported; thecleavage pattern is clearly different from that of thermolysin [37]
and camelysin [12]. Only four cleavage sites were in common
with thermolysin and two for camelysin (which is a metallo-protease from B. cereus ). The peptide bond Leu
15-Tyr16in the
oxidized insulin B-chain, which is the major cleavage productobtained from the alkaline proteases are resistant to the attackofB. cereus protease and other neutral proteases [35,36] .
3.5. Substrate speciﬁcities
Amino acids in the position P
1have a strong inﬂuence in
the catalytic action of the enzyme, see Table 4 . The B. cereus
protease showed preference for Leucine and Phenylalanineamino acids at the position P
1and exhibited the highest activity
forl-Leucine-pNA (0.145 nKat mg−1),N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-
Pro-Phe-pNa (0.216 nKat mg−1),l-Leucine-pNA and with
N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA (0.069 nKat mg−1). Low or
very low hydrolysis was detected when Ala or Gly wherethe amino acids residues at position P
1(N-Succinyl-Ala-
Ala-Ala-pNA or N-Succinyl-Gly-Gly-Gly-pNA). However, for
N-Succinyl-Gly-Gly-Phe-pNA, the rate of hydrolysis decreasedindicating that the amino acid in position P 2has inﬂuence in the
catalytic activity.
B. cereus protease exhibited no esterolytic activity towards p-
nitrophenyl esters. Shorter peptide substrates such as l-Leucine-
pNA were good substrates for this enzyme.
To investigate the effects of the amino acid residues adjacent
to the sensitivity for Leucine and Phenylalanine residues in pep-tide substrates more in detail, a kinetic study was undertakenusing various synthetic peptides. These peptides were all splitat the peptide bond containing the amino group of Leucine andPhenylalanine, see Table 5 .
The nature of the amino acid in the position P
2also inﬂuenced
the speciﬁcity for the speciﬁcity in the position P 1. This can be
seen from the difference of the kinetic parameters when compar-ing the substrates N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNa ( K
cat/Km,
0.24 mM−1s−1) and N-Succinyl-Gly-Gly-Phe-pNA ( Kcat/Km
0.040 mM−1s−1); when Proline is substituted by Glycine, the
Kcat/Kmdecreases conﬁrming the inﬂuence of amino acid
residue present at position P 2. These characteristics of speci-
ﬁcity have been found for thermolysin and for other neutralproteases from bacterial origin, which are optimally active atneutral pH and are inhibited by EDTA [37]. The results indicate
that the B. cereus protease is very similar to thermolysin not only
in the speciﬁcity against P
1position but also with regard to the
effects of amino acids residues neighbouring the site of cleav-age. However, some differences where observed in the side chainspeciﬁcity at P
2.A tP 2inB. cereus protease, Proline promotes
the hydrolysis while for thermolysin this was not observed.

Interestingly, Phe at the N-terminal side of the insulin B-
chain did not show any effect on the hydrolysis while withthe synthetic substrates the B. cereus protease show higher efﬁ-
ciency with Phe at this position. A possible explanation is dueto the inﬂuence of other amino acids at positions P
/prime
2,P/prime3, etc.,
as well as at the positions P 2,P3, etc. Based on its hydrolytic
activity towards N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Gly-Leu amide and N-
(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Ala-Phe amide, the B. cereus protease has
identical substrate speciﬁcity as thermolysin, showing the high-est kinetic for N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Ala-Phe amide ( K
cat/Km
236.84 mM−1s−1) and N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryloyl)-Gly-Leu amide
(Kcat/Km55.60 mM−1s−1) as substrates. Except for its lower
thermostability, the B. cereus protease has some similarity to
thermolysin, with respect to substrate speciﬁcity and the pres-ence of zinc (data not shown) in the molecule which is requiredfor activity [33]. However, unlike thermolysin, it does not exhibit
considerable elastolytic activity [34]. On the other hand, like
thermolysin (pH optimum between 7 and 9) it shows a broadpH optimum between 6 and 8.5. This study somewhat clariﬁedthe effects of some several neighbouring amino acid residuessurrounding the susceptible peptide bond on the appearance ofthe speciﬁcity of B. cereus protease.
The inhibition constant ( K
i) was calculated with N-(3-[2-
Furyl]acryloyl)-Ala-Phe amide as substrate at different inhibitor(EDTA) concentrations. This substrate was selected for the inhi-bition kinetics, due to the high afﬁnity of the enzyme toward thissubstrate. One important consideration in this assay was that thesubstrate was kept constant by not allowing more than 5% ofhydrolysis. The K
ivalue (0.971 mM) is almost the same as the
Km(0.858 mM) value of the corresponding substrate. On the
other hand, the Vmax(406.50 nKat mg−1) signiﬁcantly decreased
(Vimax 213.93 nKat mg−1), indicating non-competitive inhibi-
tion.
3.6. Hydrolysis of wool
Wool keratins are characterized by a high degree of cross-
linked disulﬁde bonds, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogenbonds which stabilizes keratin ﬁlament structure [4]; which are
very difﬁcult to proteolytic attack. SEM analysis ( Fig. 5 ) showed
that B. cereus protease hydrolysed the cuticles on wool surface.
An interesting effect is that somehow the enzyme “cracked” thewool surface.
Fig. 6. Comparison of the amino acids composition of hydrolysed wool after
3-h treatment with B. cereus protease and keratinase. Standard deviation based
on triplicate data.
The action of B. cereus protease on wool was done in compar-
ison with a keratinase ( Fig. 6 ), which are a group of proteolytic
enzymes able to hydrolyse insoluble keratins more efﬁcientlythan other proteases. After the enzymatic treatment, the woolwas completely hydrolysed and the amino acid analysed. Aminoacid content analysis of wool after treatment with this proteaseshows a reduction of the cystine content, which is the main con-tent of the wool cuticle, as well in the total amino acid content.The cystine content on wool after treatment with B. cereus pro-
tease is much lower after 3 h than with keratinase treatment. Theamount of the total amino acids of wool after B. cereus protease
treatment (75.3 nmol) is much lower than the one with kerati-nase treatment (88.9 nmol). This indicates that B. cereus protease
has higher catalytic activity towards wool than keratinase. Theresults showed that there was no signiﬁcant differences betweenB. cereus protease and keratinase-treated wool, which can be
said that B. cereus protease is a keratinase-type.
4. Conclusion
In this work, several different bacteria growing on wool sam-
ples were isolated. B. cereus was selected based on the level
protease production and growth toward wool.
B. cereus protease was puriﬁed to electrophoretic homo-
geneity using a combination of three chromatographic steps.1780 F . Sousa et al. / Enzyme and Microbial T echnology 40 (2007) 1772–1781
SDS-PAGE showed the homogeneity of the puriﬁed enzyme
with a molecular weight of 45.6 ±1.7 kDa.
The extracellular protease produced by B. cereus exhibits
optimal pH at 7.0 and optimum temperature at 45◦C. This
inhibition pattern is typical of metalloproteases. B. cereus
protease has some similarity to thermolysin, with respectto substrate speciﬁcity, however the cleavage pattern of theoxidized insulin B-chain is clearly different from that ofthermolysin.
Wool keratin is water insoluble and extremely resistant to
degradation by proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, pepsin andpapain. However, from SEM images of wool treated with B.
cereus protease, it was clear that this enzyme is able to degrade
the wool surface.
The results of the action of B. cereus protease toward wool
showed that B. cereus protease is a keratinase-type.
The results presented here, including some thermostability
and activity over a wide range of pH values, stability againstsome organic solvents and detergents, hydrolysis of various pro-tein substrates (such as azocasein, azocoll, keratin azure andwool), endopeptidase activity and broad speciﬁcity, demonstratethat B. cereus protease will most probably play an important
role for the application in the anti-shrinking process efﬁcientlyhydrolysing wool cuticles. However, as we have describedbefore, increasing the molecular weight of this enzyme by chem-ical modiﬁcation will be necessary to target its action to the woolsurface [38].
