INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN PLASTIC INGESTION BY 
SEABIRDS AND THE FLUX OF PLASTIC THROUGH 
SEABIRD POPULATIONS

Abstract. Patterns of intraspecific variability of ingested plastic loads in seabirds were 
examined for species collected off southern Africa. The incidence of plastic pollution was 
shown to be increasing during the 1980s. Both large- and small-scale geographic variation 
in plastic loads occurred as a function of variable plastic density in the environment. In- 
tergenerational transfer of plastic particles was identified as an important pathway for plastic 
flow in those species that accumulate plastic particles and feed their chicks by regurgitation. 
This pathway can account for higher plastic loads in nonbreeders and failed breeders than 
in birds that breed successfully, and such results need not indicate adverse effects from 
plastic ingestion. Intergenerational transfer resulted in annual cycling of plastic loads in 
successfully breeding birds. In species that do not regurgitate indigestible stomach contents, 
immature birds have the largest plastic loads and are most likely to exhibit adverse effects 
from plastic ingestion.

recorded in seabird stomachs in the early 1960s 
(Bennett 1960, Rothstein 1973, Harper and 
Fowler 1987), following the rapid growth of the 
plastics industry in the 1950s (Colton 1974). Since 
then the incidence of plastic in seabirds has in- 
creased to its present ubiquitous level (Day et al. 
1985, Ryan 1988). Day (1980) and Day et al. 
(1985) showed a general increase in the incidence 
of plastic in Short-tailed Shearwaters (Pufinus 
tenuirostris) up until the study ended in 1977. 
Similar increases in plastic loads have been doc- 
umented for three species of prion (Puchyptilu) 
between 1960 and 1977 (Harper and Fowler based on comparisons of plastic loads in simi-

AGE-RELATED VARIATION 
Day (1980) and Day et al. (1985) reported larger 
plastic loads in immature than in adult Parakeet 
Auklets (Cyclorrhynchus psittacula) and Tufted 
Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata). These differences 
were attributed to hypothesized broader foraging 
niches and perhaps greater dietary experimen- 
tation by young, inexperienced birds (e.g., Porter 
and Sealy 1982). This apparently is the case in 
Kelp Gulls foraging at garbage dumps in south- 
ern Africa: the frequency of occurrence of in- 
gested plastic in immature birds (four of 12 birds, 
identified by at least some brown, immature 
plumage) was significantly greater than that in 
adults (one of 18 birds; G = 4.03, df = 1, P < 
0.05). Kelp Gulls regularly regurgitate indiges- 
tible stomach contents as pellets (Ryan 1988), 
so there is no plastic accumulation, and particles 
found in the stomach have been ingested re- 
cently. However, most Procellariiformes (and 
most auks; Harris 1984; R. H. Day, in litt.) sel- 
dom regurgitate pellets, allowing plastic particles 
to accumulate in the stomach (Furness 1985a, 
1985b; Ryan, in press). This fact, coupled with 
the intergenerational transfer of plastic from par- 
ents to chicks, allows an alternative interpreta- 
tion of age-related variation in the incidence of 
plastic in many seabird species. 
Plastic particles frequently are found in the 
stomachs of seabird chicks (Kenyon and Kridler 
1969, Rothstein 1973, Pettit et al. 1981) and 
occasionally in meals fed to chicks (Day 1980, 
pers. observ.). With the exception of Laysan Al- 
batross (Diomedea immutabilis) chicks, which 
sometimes eat plastic objects lying around their 
nests (Fry et al. 1987) all the plastic in seabird 
chicks derives from meals from their parents. I 
suggest that the larger plastic loads found in im- 
matures than in adults can be partially explained 
by this intergenerational transfer of plastic par- 
ticles, at least in those species that regurgitate 
food to their chicks. For example, all 15 Blue 
Petrel (Halobaena caerulea) chicks collected at 
the Prince Edward Islands contained plastic par- 
ticles, and both the number and total mass of 
particles were significantly larger in chicks than 
in adults (Table 1; U,,,,, = 605.5, 537, respec- tively; P < 0.00 1,0.02, respectively). Plastic also 
was more frequent in White-chinned Petrel (Pro- 
cellaria aequinoctialis) and Kerguelen Petrel 
(Pterodroma brevirostris) fledglings (seven of sev- 
en and eight of 26, respectively) than in adults 
(108 of 193 and two of 23, respectively, excluding 
beached birds; G = 7.93, 3.90, respectively; df = 
1; P < 0.05, 0.01, respectively). 
Plastic in seabird chicks comes from their par- 
ents; this allows insight into plastic flux through 
seabird populations. If particles fed to chicks de- 
rive solely from particles ingested on foraging 
trips during chick rearing, the rate of accumu- 
lation in chicks gives a minimal estimate of the 
natural ingestion rate. Coupled with the known 
incidence of ingested plastic, these data would 
allow calculation of the rate of wear of plastic 
particles in seabird stomachs. Alternatively, if 
particles fed to chicks derive both from particles 
stored in the parents’ gizzards and from those 
ingested during the chick-rearing period, loss to 
chicks would form an additional mechanism for 
the removal of accumulated plastic particles in 
species that regurgitate indigestible stomach con- 
tents only when feeding chicks. 
Evidence from Blue Petrels suggests that the 
latter explanation is correct; plastic particles in 
chicks were significantly smaller than were those 
in adults (Fig.-1; x2 = 42.35, df = 5; P < 0.001). 
This result is consistent with the hypothesis that 
chicks are fed particles that have been stored in 
the parents’ gizzards for some time, and thus are 
smaller as a result of wear within the parents’ 
stomachs. In addition, ifplastic loads fed to chicks 
represented only that plastic ingested by adults 
during the chick-rearing period, adult Blue Pe- 
trels would have to ingest a plastic particle ap- 
proximately once every 2 days, giving a particle 
turnover time through wear (during the non- 
breeding season) also measured in days. Alba- 
trosses are known to retain indigestible objects 
in the stomach for up to 6 weeks (Pettit et al. 
1981, Furness et al. 1984) and plastic particles 
fed to White-chinned Petrels were little changed 
after 12 days in their stomachs (Ryan and Jack- 
son 1987). 
However, intergenerational transfer of plastic 
particles cannot explain the larger plastic loads 
reported for immature Tufted Puffins and Par- 
akeet Auklets (Day 1980, Day et al. 1985), be- 
cause puffins feed their chicks whole prey carried 
in the bill and do not regurgitate stored food, and

successfully indicated an adverse effect of plastic 
ingestion. In general, however, inference that 
plastic ingestion causes reduced breeding success 
from observations of larger plastic loads in non- 
breeding birds must be interpreted with caution.

sublingual pouches (BCdard 1969) with little if 
any transfer of stored plastic (R. H. Day, in litt.). 
The age-related difference in plastic loads of these 
species probably is related to feeding-niche dif- 
ferences between age groups, as suggested by Day 
(1980) and Day et al. (1985). 
A consequence of the transfer of accumulated 
plastic particles from parents to chicks is that it 
should produce smaller plastic loads in success- 
fully breeding birds than in nonbreeders or failed 
breeders (i.e., pairs that failed before egg hatch- 
ing). Among Broad-billed Pi-ions collected at 
Gough Island during the chick-rearing period 
(October/November), birds with well-developed 
brood patches contained plastic significantly less 
frequently (six of 38) than did those lacking a 
well-developed brood patch (five of 10; G = 4.66, 
df= 1; P < 0.05). 
Day (1980) and Day et al. (1985) demonstrated 
larger plastic loads in nonbreeding than in breed- 
ing Parakeet Auklets, a species which has little 
if any transfer of plastic between generations (R. 
H. Day, in litt.). It was suggested that the failure

VARIATION 
The intergenerational transfer of plastic particles 
from parents to chicks has a major impact on 
short-term variation in plastic loads in some sea- 
bird species. Breeding adults of species that ac- 
cumulate plastic particles and feed their chicks 
by regurgitating stored food will exhibit an an- 
nual cycle in the incidence of plastic, with plastic 
loads at their lowest levels immediately after the 
breeding season, gradually increasing throughout 
the nonbreeding season, and peaking before 
hatching in the following breeding season. Losses 
of accumulated particles to chicks reduce adult 
plastic loads to the postbreeding minimum. This 
provides an alternative explanation to that of 
Day (1980) and Day et al. (1985) which was 
attributed to changes in the ingestion rate of plas- 
tic particles. 
Short-tailed Shearwaters exhibited a gradual 
increase in the number of ingested plastic par- 
ticles off Alaska during the austral winter, with 
levels much greater than those found in breeding 
birds in Australia during the austral summer (Day 
1980, Day et al. 1985). This pattern is consistent 
with the annual cycle hypothesis outlined above. 
The smaller average plastic loads in breeding birds 
is reinforced by the scarcity of nonbreeding in- 
dividuals around breeding grounds, because many 
remain in the North Pacific Ocean (Harrison 
1983). Skira (1986) demonstrated a gradual de- 
crease in plastic incidence in breeding Short-tailed 
Shearwaters throughout the breeding season, al- 
though she did not identify chick feeding as the 
major mechanism for losing plastic. 
The only trend in plastic incidence in Short- 
tailed Shearwaters recorded by Day (1980) and 
Day et al. (1985) not predicted by the annual 
cycle hypothesis is the decrease in plastic loads 
in September, just before the breeding season. 
This observation was based on a small sample 
of birds (12), however, and none of the monthly 
changes in the number of particles/bird departs 
significantly from the overall frequency for birds 
collected off Alaska (G = 5.69, 1.3 1, 3.5 1, 4.11, 
and 4.56, respectively; df = 3; P > 0.1; for May, 
June, July, August, and September, respectively). 450 PETER G. RYAN

Day (1980) and Day et al. (1985) supported 
the explanation of seasonal variation in plastic 
loads based on seasonal changes in plastic inges- 
tion rate with data on the wear state of particles 
in Short-tailed Shearwaters. I have reservations 
about the accuracy of wear data (see Methods), 
especially because particles at sea exhibit a range 
of wear states (Ryan 1986). In fact, none of the 
monthly wear frequencies reported by Day (1980) 
and Day et al. (1985) departs significantly from 
the summed data for birds collected off Alaska 
(G = 3.19, 4.72, 0.77, 2.04, and 2.52, respec- 
tively; df = 3; P > 0.1; for May, June, July, 
August, and September, respectively). 
The seasonal variations in plastic loads in sea- 
birds collected off southern Africa also support 
the annual cycle hypothesis. Plastic loads in Blue 
Petrels collected in April (postbreeding) were sig- 
nificantly smaller than were those in birds col- 
lected during August to September, just prior to 
the breeding season (Table 1; U,,,,, = 389,367.5; 
P < 0.05, 0.1; for number and mass of plastic 
particles, respectively). There also was signifi- 
cantly more pumice in adult Blue Petrels col- 
lected prior to the breeding season than in birds 
collected after the breeding season (Table 1; 
u ,5,,5 = 321.5, 322; P < 0.001; for number and 
mass of pumice, respectively). 
Similarly, the frequency of occurrence of plas- 
tic in White-chinned Petrels and Sooty Shear- 
waters (Pujjhus griseus) was greater during the 
prebreeding period than during the postbreeding 
period (Table 2) although the difference was sig- TABLE 2. Seasonal fluctuations in the frequency of

Fisher’s exact test). The greatest frequencies of 
occurrence of plastic in these two species off the 
southwestern coast of South Africa occurred dur- 
ing the breeding season (Table 2), when only non- 
breeding birds were present. The annually cycli- 
cal fluctuations presumably are damped in these 
data sets because of the inclusion of immature 
birds, which cannot readily be distinguished from 
adult birds during the nonbreeding season. 
FLUX OF PLASTIC THROUGH SEABIRD 
POPULATIONS 
The annual cycle hypothesis assumes that the 
intergenerational transfer of plastic is the most 
important pathway for plastic flux in those species 
of seabird that feed their chicks regurgitated 
meals. The ingestion-regulated model of Day 
(1980) and Day et al. (1985), in which variable 
ingestion rates, balanced by fairly constant ero- 
sion, determine plastic loads, can be replaced for 
these species by a new model in which a more 
constant ingestion rate is countered by fairly con- 
stant erosion plus a regular dumping of accu- 
mulated particles into chicks by successful breed- 
ing birds (and birds that at least reach the 
chick-rearing stage). I do not doubt that temporal 
variations in ingestion rate occur, but feel that 
these are negligible compared to transfer to chicks, 
given that the lifespan of plastic particles subject 
to erosion within seabird stomachs is of the order 
of years (Ryan and Jackson 1987). However, in- 
dividual differences in diet and/or foraging area 
could account for much intraspecific variability 
in plastic loads. 
The addition of another variable to the model 
does not improve understanding of the magni- 
tude of the pathways involved. Assuming that 
all accumulated plastic is passed onto chicks dur- 
ing chick rearing (as suggested by data in Skira 
1986) and that ingestion and erosion rates are 
nificant only for Sooty Shearwaters (P = 0.03, constant, the amount of plastic in fledglings rep- PLASTIC IN SEABIRDS 451

relation between the amount of plastic and other 
indigestible remains in the gizzards of several 
petrel species and I found no correlation between 
the amount of plastic and pumice in prebreeding 
Blue Petrels (r, = 0.23,O. 11; df = 13; for number

significant correlation between plastic and pum-

occur: the behavior of procellariiforms at sea is 
still largely unknown (Brown 1980). However, it 
is unlikely that egestion occurs in most procel- 
lariiforms. If egestion were an important path-
