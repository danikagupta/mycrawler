Abstract
Plastic debris have been shown to degenerate to particle sizes that can be transported in air, water, 
and food. Small particles are documented to enter and exit our bodies and translocate to and from 
some internal organs. Health effects on respiratory, hepatic, immune, and gastrointestinal systems 
have been reported in humans and other mammals in response to elevated particle or fiber 
exposures. These health effects differed by plastic type and size, and there was evidence of dose 
response for a few health endpoints. We conducted a systematic word search and reviewed 
published literature to identify microplastic and nanoplastic studies that quantified exposure via 
the ingestion, inhalation, and subcutaneous absorption (not dermal) exposure pathways; identified 
translocation, internal dose, and associations with health effects and markers related to exposures 
to specific sizes and types of plastics. We identified the data gaps in relating exposure data to 
health effects and biomarkers, most notably the lack of characterization of plastic particles and 
fibers smaller than 10 microns in most media.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIntroduction
Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles with a size less than 5 millimeters (mm) that 
pervade the environment because of extensive plastic use and persistence of the polymer 
materials (Frias & Nash, 2019). Nanoplastics (NPs) have been defined as plastic material 
less than 0.001 mm (1 μm, da Costa et al, 2016 ). Because of many beneficial characteristics, 
MPs and NPs have been intentionally placed in cleaning products, coatings, cosmetics, and 
medical applications ( Thompson, 2018 ; AMEC, 2017 ; Leslie, 2014 ) and are also created 
when bottles, clothing, tires, and packaging break down in the environment. From those 
sources, MPs and NPs can be transported into streams and seas, carried into the air, and fall 
with rain ( Cai et al., 2017 ; Underwood et al., 2017 ). They can be ingested by marine animals 
and be found in fish, crabmeat, and table salt (Waite et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2015 ). As with 
other persistent organic pollutants, the primary MP and NP exposure routes for humans are 
suspected to be inhalation, ingestion and dermal absorption, with evidence confirming 
inhalation and ingestion. MP and NP markers have been detected in urine and feces ( CDC, 
2019 ; Schwabl et al., 2019 ). Since MP and NP markers have been detected in human waste, 
health scientists must investigate whether absorption occurs and whether exposures to MPs 
and NPs are harmful.
Recent news of large plastic debris physically harming the internal organs of whales and 
birds raises pertinent questions about which types of plastic are potentially bioactive in 
people and may be harmful to human health. People can avoid swallowing large plastic 
debris, but perhaps the less avoidable smaller plastics debris could pose physical or physio-
chemical harm to internal human systems. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease 
Registry (ATSDR), with its long history of evaluating community exposures, is joining the 
National Center for Environmental Heath (NCEH), with its experience in evaluating national 
exposure trends, to investigate literature involving human exposure to MPs (NCEH/ATSDR, 
2019). This review of the literature summarizes the evidence of exposure, the largest data 
gaps in quantifying exposure, and the potential for microplastic substances to pose a public 
health hazard. The evidence includes:
1. MP data collected in food and water that allow us to calculate some exposures;
2. Worker and animal exposure studies that show the unique toxicity of different 
MPs;
3. Biomonitoring data that indicates markers of exposure and effect that suggests 
physio-chemical effects.
Review Methods:
We conducted three initial internet searches for all published articles and followed up on 
categorical searches for each, namely:
1. Human environmental exposure:  We included the specific terms for, 
“microplastic” and “environment” and identified those published articles that that 
indicated human exposure through ingestion or direct inhalation, exposures 
included in ATSDRs exposure guidance (2016 a ,b,c, & 2018 ). We also reviewed Zarus et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptreferences for additional publications. We requested raw data from some authors 
to calculate potential human exposures.
2. Worker Exposures:  We conducted specific searches for worker and 
occupational exposures to synthetics, textiles, flocking, polyvinyl chloride, PVC, 
nylon, polyethylene, plastics, and aramid. We also reviewed references for 
additional publications. We then used search terms listed in the referenced 
animal studies.
3. Biomarkers of exposure and effects : We conducted specific searches for 
biomarkers of exposure to both plastics and synthetics. We followed up with 
searches on those references and included additional terms for implant 
degradation.
More than three hundred articles were identified from the initial searches. Articles were 
divided into folders in a federal share site (Max.gov\HHS\Microplastics). The list of the 
fifteen initial folders included in the share site are as follows: air, analytical methods, biota, 
citizen science, freshwater, human, human epidemiological case studies, human food, ice 
and polar regions, saltwater, sediment, soil, wastewater, worldwide distribution and 
transport. Additional publicly available data were screened and added as discovered, in a 
less systematic way, during the development of this manuscript. During the review process 
of the manuscript, references were added to describe specific processes.
Human exposure to MPs in the environment
Worldwide, MP ingestion has been recorded in about 200 animal species ( Wang et al., 2016 ; 
Wang et al., 2018 ). However, researchers have examined only a few of the sizes and types of 
polymers that are characteristic of environmental MPs and only a handful of the MP-
containing media to which humans are exposed ( Dris et al., 2017 ; Kosuth et al., 2018 ; 
Leslie, 2014 ). Most MP studies focus on ecological effects rather than human health effects. 
Many of those ecological studies are conducted with a species-specific focus to determine if 
the MP is affecting them. ( Underwood et al., 2017 ). Thus, it difficult to relate the exposures 
up the food web ( Koelmans, 2020 ). Furthermore, the sampling methods differ widely from 
those used to measure synthetic fiber or other plastic microparticles within highly exposed 
people ( Zarus, 2020 ). Therefore, it is difficult to make direct comparisons of many studies. 
Calculating a dose for human exposure to MPs requires data on their polymer types, sizes, 
masses, and numbers in food, water, or air. However, studies addressing human exposure 
have not yet provided these data, and only a handful of environmental studies have the 
appropriate data to quantify human MP exposure (Table 1).
Humans come into contact with MPs through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption 
routes ( Dris et al., 2017 ; Kosuth, Mason, & Wattenberg, 2018 ; Leslie, 2014 ). Bivalves 
(clams, mussels, or oysters) are commonly examined as quantitative aquatic exposure 
models because they filter MPs from the water and accumulate them easily. Some of the data 
collected on these species can be related to calculate human exposure. To relate these data to 
human dosimetry, ecologists and environmental scientists weigh the edible flesh and report Zarus et al. Page 3
Sci Total Environ . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 20.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthe MP counts per unit tissue mass ( Li et al., 2016 ; Su et al., 2018 ; Van Cauwenberghe & 
Janssen, 2014 ; Waite et al., 2018 ).
Although we can calculate doses from these studies, each study focuses on MPs of different 
sizes, and none focus on very small (<25 μm) particles that may be absorbed by people who 
eat bivalves. Different MP size ranges, including smaller particles to which humans may be 
exposed have been studied in soil, fertilizer, and plastic tea bags ( Esan, Abbey & Yurgel, 
2019 ; Weithmann et al., 2018 ; Blasing & Amelung, 2018 ).
Although the data from these studies represent only a small portion of our total potential MP 
exposure, they demonstrate that humans are exposed to MP particles of sizes and 
compositions for which studies reviewed in this manuscript have demonstrated health 
effects. Effects include tissue lodging of MP in spleen and liver and tissue immune response 
associated with degradation of plastic implants; and lung damage from inhalation, and 
associations with liver and gastro intestinal effects from workplace exposures ( Walker & 
Bullough, 1973 ; V obecky, Devroede, & Caro, 1984 ; Hicks et al., 1996 ; Burkhart et al., 1999 ; 
Urban et al., 2000 ; Ward et al., 2002 ; Nichols et al., 2013 ; Gennaro et al., 2008 ). Table 1 
summarizes several studies of the environmental media through which humans may be 
exposed and attempts to estimate a daily MP dose for these media. These doses are 
calculated using established exposure factors or average intake rates per person where 
appropriate ( ATSDR 2005 ; ATSDR 2016 a &b; ATSDR 2018 ; HHS 2015 ), without dividing 
by the many possible body weights that represent specific U.S. populations ( ATSDR 2016c ). 
The established exposure factors allow direct estimates of exposure within Table 4. An 
inhalation rate of 15 M3 per day can be applied to the 5.4MP /m3 to estimate a daily 
exposure of 81 MP and a water consumption rate of 3 L per day can be applied to the tap 
water measurement of 9.24/L to estimate a daily exposure of 28 MP.
Other calculations require a few steps. A typical fish consumption rate of 8 ounces per day 
can be directly applied to the average mass of the fish reported by Karami et al., 2017 . In 
that study, scientists identified 61 MP-like particles were isolated from four small fish 
species (n= 30 each) totaling approximately 761g. The species ranged from anchovy to 
Indian mackerel (ranging 1.5–58.5 g), with an average fish mass of 25 g. Thus, there are 2 
MP for each 25 g of fish and 18 MP for each 8 ounces (or 227 g) of fish. Recognizing that 
wet weight is often more representative of what people eat ( ATSDR 2005 ), the MP wet 
concentration could be 10% of the dry weight, resulting in a low estimate of 2 MP/ 8-ounce 
fish. This particular fish study provided additional characterization, as they reported 
frequency distributions for each species and provided data on fragments, film, and filaments. 
This could allow for more specific exposure assessment for these fish. This information is 
not comparable to most other studies.
While a general MP inhalation dose can be calculated from one set of environmental studies 
(14–81/day) ( Dris et al., 2017 ; Gasperi et al., 2015 ), there were several data gaps that 
preclude any health assessment of human exposures. The fibers collected were larger than 50 
μm limiting evaluation of possible effects observed in highly exposed populations ( Zarus, 
2020 ). Although many studies calculate doses from food sources like clams, mussels, and 
oysters, these sources make up a small percentage of U.S. food consumption. A single 8oz Zarus et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptserving of oysters and clams might expose humans to 2000 MP particles, but nothing is 
known of MP exposure from the more common U.S. diet, consisting of chicken, pork, beef, 
wheat, and vegetables. Although most studies focus on the gastrointestinal tract of fish 
(Rochman et al., 2015 ; Karami et al., 2017 ), there are some data to evaluate human MP 
uptake from fish. Scientific literature suggests we have exposure of 2–10 MP particles per 
fish we eat ( Karami et al., 2017 ). Marine studies also find MPs in plankton, but not the 
plankton typically consumed by people directly and indirectly ( Baini et al., 2017 ). However, 
we know that humans consume an algae-derived tablet for osteoarthritis, which by the study-
inference would contain 2 MP particles, and humans also ingest Nori wraps (for Japanese 
foods), which by study-inference, could contain 113 MP particles.
U.S. residents typically consume meat from livestock and poultry more frequently than fish 
and shellfish, but no MP studies are currently available for those meat sources. However, 
data are available for sea clam viscera, which is a good protein (lysine) supplement for 
growing pigs and clams readily accumulate MPs ( Wohlt et al., 1994 ). A pig eating 2 kg/day 
with less than 5% clam viscera could by inference ingest 200 MP particles/day –18,000 
particles in 90 days (from clams with 2 particles/g). Additional MP exposure to pigs is 
possible from ingesting the MPs found in soils ( Blasing & Amelung, 2018 ). Drawing from 
other animal and cell exposure studies, some of these plastics are excreted, but there is 
evidence of some accumulation ( Underwood et al., 2017 ; Watson et al., 2016).
Several studies have demonstrated large quantities of MPs in table salt and suggest that sea 
salt has even larger quantities ( Iñiguez, Conesa, & Fullana, 2017 ; Kosuth et al., 2018 ; Yang 
et al., 2015 ). Typical use of salt in the United States could result in human ingestion of 4 MP 
particles/day ( HHS, 2015 ). Although fewer data are available on drinking water, the limited 
data suggest consumption of 4–30 MP particles about 1 mm in length per day in water; 
however, fine particle concentration is unknown ( Kosuth et al., 2018 ). Analysis of tea from 
tea bags, however ( Hernandez et al., 2019 ), revealed that tea drinkers ingest billions of NP 
particles from a plastic tea bag. Adding a teaspoon of sugar could add about one MP 
particle. Although the tea analysis included MPs 50 times smaller than those measured in 
water (and sugar), no clear method is available to calculate cumulative MP doses.
Despite the focus on ecological studies of marine environments, little is known about marine 
exposures for subsistent populations. MP calculations from a diet of bivalves and some fish 
suggest that human MP ingestion among sea-subsistent populations would result in exposure 
to 1,000–5,000 MPs/day; however, the full diet of these populations is not well known. A 
recent study of whales found 8,000 – 29,156 ng/g phthalate esters (PAE) in whale blubber 
(Baini et al., 2017 ). A survey of Native American communities identified one community 
harvesting 32.6 kg of whale per person in 2005–2006 ( Ahmasuk et al., 2008 ). Consuming 
one third of this amount could result in a possible ingestion dose of 31 to 114 mg/yr of 
PAEs. While there is no relationship between whale PAE to MPs, there are ratios in plankton 
and seawater. Whale PAE levels were 5 to 18 times higher than in the plankton consumed by 
the whales whereas other studies find just trace levels of PAEs in seawater, 3–1000 times 
lower than in the plankton (Heo et al., 2019; Corchran et al, 2009 ; Paluselli et al., 2018a , 
2018b ). Seawater PAE concentrations were highly correlated with seasonal re-suspension of 
plastics and microplastics ( Paluselli et al., 2018 a , 2018 b ; Xie et al. 2007 ).Zarus et al. Page 5
Sci Total Environ . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 20.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIf the same ratios of MPs to PAE were applied to whale meat, it would suggest 7–26 million 
MPs per year (71,000 MP fibers per day). This value is a thousand times more than the 
exposure from fish and clams shown in Table 1 and hundreds of times higher than calculated 
in recent studies ( Cox et al., 2019 ; Senathirajah & Palanisami, 2019 ). Thus, the lack of MP 
and NP analysis in whale and other mammals is a large data gap in determining MP 
exposure in many, especially subsistent, populations. Absent critical data in mammals, some 
diets could result in ingestion rates from 50 to many thousands to many billions of 
microplastic fibers and particles per day (of varying sizes <5mm). This range is much 
broader than the ranges determined in two recent MP consumption studies of about 100–300 
particles/day for ingestion and 210–330/day for ingestion and inhalation ( Cox et al., 2019 ; 
Senathirajah & Palanisami, 2019 ), which has been described as amounting to “a credit 
card’s worth of microplastics” per week (WWF, 2019).
Evidence that some microplastics are harmful to people
A few dozen studies of workers, animals, and patients with plastic implants have provided 
evidence to suggest unique toxicity from exposure to some types of MPs ( Chen et al., 2019 ; 
Zarus et al., 2020 b ). Lung effects are associated with size, form, and type; liver effects were 
associated with type; immune effects appear to be more effected by size and shape; yet the 
full mechanisms of toxicity are not as well studied as other particles. Table 2 presents a 
summary of worker-related studies that indicate some unique health outcomes. The table 
summarizes the exposure measurements and health effects associated with three industries 
that commonly use MPs: flocking (applying surface texture), textile, and polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) manufacturing. Workers within all three industries report respiratory effects 
associated with inhaling MP dust. These effects contrast with (different) effects associated 
with inhaling natural fibers. People working longer or in dustier (MP) areas had more severe 
health effects ( Valic & Zuskin, 1977 ). Some studies include measurements of total dust, but 
not enough samples to determine a dose response, in people or in animals ( Atis et al., 2005 ; 
Burkhart et al., 1999 ; Valic & Zuskin, 1977 ; Pimentel et al., 1975 ). The mechanisms of 
toxicity are much less understood compared with natural mineral particulate exposures. 
Early studies of mineral toxicity, such as asbestos, found that thin fibers deposited and 
accumulated in the lower lung at higher rates than thick fibers. Synthetic fibers were not as 
thin as the most harmful natural fibers. However, synthetic fibers have become much finer in 
the past 20 years ( Warheit et al., 2001 ). These effects are apparent in three industries (Table 
2) and a few follow-up animal studies ( Marsh et al., 1994 ; Porter et al., 1999 ; Pimentel et al., 
1975 ).
Flocking:
The main effect reported in flock workers was pulmonary inflammatory response, whether 
the synthetic polymer was nylon, polyethylene, or polypropylene ( Burkhart et al., 1999 ; 
Barrow 2002; Atkis et al., 2002). A follow up animal study using nylon flock from Burkhart 
(Burkhart et al., 1999 ) indicates that the nylon MPs were the cause of toxicity, rather than 
the nylon diacyl chloride and diamine monomers ( Porter et al., 1999 ). All lung-
inflammatory endpoints increased after one acute inhalation exposure to MPs, along with 
fibrosis-induced lung remodeling with continued exposure to nylon particles; but no Zarus et al. Page 6
Sci Total Environ . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 20.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptsignificant inflammatory response was observed in the comparison group that was exposed 
to nylon monomers as a liquid. Additionally, the majority of MPs identified in industrial 
exposures were larger (10–15 μm) than would normally be described as respirable particles, 
suggesting that ingestion or dermal exposures may also have occurred ( Burkhart et al., 
1999 ). Respirable dust levels were very high in this study, 5–40 mg/m3. All 143 valid worker 
pulmonary X-rays were abnormal; and all workers who worked in areas with highest dust 
concentrations reported recent pneumonia or asthma.
Textiles:
Studies of workers exposed to synthetic fibers and synthetic textiles reported colorectal 
cancer in addition to respiratory effects. Exposure to polyester antigens resulted in visible 
antibody precipitin reactions, but exposure to nylon, wool-polyester, or controls did not 
(Pimentel, Avila & Lourenço, 1975 ). While several studies indicated similar health effects 
from these fiber types, the industries are increasingly developing finer sized fibers ( Warheit, 
et al., 2001 ). Aramid (i.e.; Kevlar®) worker and animal exposure data are limited, but 
fractured Aramid fibers have properties that deserve further study ( Marsh et al., 1994 ; Xing 
& Ding 2007 ). One health hazard evaluation identified Aramid fiber respiratory risks similar 
to other synthetic textiles, but the concentrations of airborne fibers was much lower than 
reported in textile facilities with other polymer fibers ( NIOSH 2000 ; Valic & Zuskin, 1977 ). 
However, protein markers indicated that Aramid MPs (of 6 × 0.4 μm) were as cytotoxic to 
cultured tracheal epithelial cells as crocidolite (3.14 × 0.15 μm) or chrysotile (3.21 × 0.063 
μm) asbestos ( Marsh et al., 1994 ). The response increased with dose in terms of either mass 
or fiber count, but calculation of an equivalent inhalation dose from cultured cells is not 
possible. Other animal studies indicate that Aramid could degrade in the lungs (Warheit et 
al. 2005) or within incubated blood cells ( Wening & Lorke, 1992 ). However, these studies 
used uncoated Aramid fibers. Newer advances of coatings, with nanomaterials reduce the 
degradation of Aramid fragments ( Xing & Ding 2007 ).
PVC:
Studies show a clear difference between PVC and other synthetics. PVC MP workers were 
found to have elevated incidence of lung and liver cancers, but no colorectal cancers, in 
contrast with the elevated incidence of colorectal cancers observed among those who worked 
with other polymers used in textiles, but there are insufficient details to link PVC dust to the 
liver cancers. A large class action among Italian vinyl chloride and PVC workers resulted in 
several studies to differentiate exposure types. Although the liver is a target organ of vinyl 
chloride vapor inhalation ( ATSDR, 2006 ), PVC particles were thought to not affect the liver 
as extensively. In another study, PVC dust exposure was associated with risk of liver cancer 
among workers ( Mastangelo et al., 2003 ). Those working as PVC baggers showed 
significant increase in deaths from all cancers and cardiovascular disease, but only the 
autoclave workers showed significant liver tumor-related deaths ( Gennaro et al., 2008 ). Dust 
measurements and characteristics varied within these facilities. Total dust ranged from 0.15 
to 18.4 mg/m3 in some areas and 0.28 to 45.6 mg/m3 in the workers’ personal monitors with 
averages of 7 mg/m3 in the suspension and 5.2 in the mg/m3 in the emulsion areas (Casula et 
al., 1988). Other indications of differential toxicity are found in rodent studies showing that Zarus et al. Page 7

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptPVC particles caused pulmonary inflammation and damage similar to silica-induced 
inflammation after 2 days ( Xu et al., 2004 ).
Although these studies revealed toxicities that differed among MP types, the health risks 
were as severe as other occupational dust exposures. In comparison, carbon black 
manufacturing workers were exposed to primary submicron (10–500 nm) particles and their 
aggregates (80–800 nm) during the manufacturing process ( Gardiner et al., 1992 ). These 
workers developed small opacities on chest radiographs and showed both decreased forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and decreased forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF25–
75%); they also exhibited symptoms of chronic bronchitis ( Gardiner et al., 1992 ; 1996 ; 
2001 ). In an animal model, Brown et al., 2001  demonstrated a significantly greater 
neutrophil influx in rat lungs after instilling 64 nm polystyrene particles compared with 202 
and 535 nm particles of polystyrene. The large surface area to mass ratio observed in micro 
polystyrene ( Brown et al., 2001 ) was considered the possible cause of greater pro-
inflammatory activity.
Although the available worker studies do not provide sufficient information to permit 
calculation of a MP dose response, the measured levels of respirable MP dust were about 
1000 times higher than levels measured in household air ( Dris et al., 2017 ). Permissible 
worker exposure levels to dust are about 100 times higher than ambient air quality standards 
(ACGIH, 2019 ; EPA, 2014 ). See Table 2.
Markers of MP exposure and health effects
The reports of colorectal and liver cancers among synthetic fiber and textile workers suggest 
evidence of exposure by uptake and absorption of the fibers by inhalation and ingestion. 
Table 3 summarizes some of the evidence. In many of these cases, the evidence was not 
specific to just microplastics exposure, but can be used to explain transport or uptake when 
combined with other methods. In a recent study, MPs were found in feces of eight 
individuals, independent of the individuals’ occupation ( Schwabl et al., 2019 ). This 
suggested that the general population has some MP exposure. However, these results do not 
represent what was absorbed into the body. Many other studies identify phthalates alone 
(absent MP) which could be the result of MP exposure, phthalate only exposure, or exposure 
to phthalates from plastic product use ( CDC, 2019 ).
Smaller particles, e.g., NPs, pass through cell membranes more readily. Unfortunately, few 
data are available on transmembrane nano-sized plastic exposure and transport. But 
breakdown PE plastics (MP and NP) have been identified in lymph nodes ( Urban et al., 
2000 ). Other studies revealed that nanoparticles (of 0.02–0.05) microns can diffuse through 
lymphatics along with fluids, proteins, immune cells, and return to the blood (Ikomi et al., 
2012; Al-Sid-Cheikh et al., 2018 ). While scallop membranes differ from human membranes, 
studies also showed that scallops took up and eliminated 0.024 μm polystyrene faster than 
0.25 μm particles and provided evidence that the sub-100 nm (0.024 μm particles) were 
translocated across membranes ( Al-Sid-Cheikh et al., 2018 ). The hydrophobic core of the 
plasma membrane blocks large, polar, and charged particles, but many nanoplastics are not 
charged and could theoretically passively permeate cell membranes ( Yang & Hinner, 2015 ). Zarus et al. Page 8
Sci Total Environ . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 20.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptUptake of particles as large as 100 microns has been observed (V olkheimer, et al., 1962, 
1969 , 1975 , 2001 ), but it is possible that some types of particles are more easily absorbed 
than others.
Recent studies of implanted plastic, ceramic, and other materials indicated that the shapes 
and sizes of the capsules affected absorption, more so than the material. Implanted capsules 
as large as 2 mm produced a tissue response. Capsules 1.5 mm in length caused greater 
effects than smaller ones, possibly due to the greater mass ( Ward et al., 2002 ; Nichols et al., 
2013 ; Veiseh et al., 2015 ; Andorko & Jewell 2017 ). Most of the studies of MPs in the 
environment report data related to particles of this size (0.1–3 mm) (Table 1).
Some health studies have reported an immune response to absorbed particles. Immune 
responses were clearly observed in patients whose polyethylene (PE) plastic implants were 
degrading ( Walker, 1973 ; Hicks, 1996 ; Urban, 2000 ). The majority of the MP particles (PE) 
measured in abdominal lymph nodes were 1 μm, and the largest were 50 μm ( Urban, 2000 ). 
These sizes are consistent with the size range of particles shown to be transported within the 
human (or mammalian) body (V olkheimer et al., 1975; Walker et al., 1973 ; Kononenko et 
al., 2015 ; Andorko & Jewell, 2017 ). Exposure to polyetheretherketone (PEEK) particles 
resulted in a similar immune effect (increased inflammatory cytokine release) as PE in 
animal studies. Approximately 13 μm PEEK particles had the greatest effect (Stratton-
Powell et al., 2018). Although MP studies of patients with PE and PEEK implant breakdown 
focused on immune responses, other effects are possible. A report from an in-vitro study 
found that elevated concentrations of polystyrene (PS) NP were cytotoxic to cultured mouse 
neuronal cells. The cytotoxicity evident by the release of proinflammatory cytokines from 
the cells, however, was only detected at high particle concentrations (Jung et al. 2020). 
Cytotoxic effects have been seen with other nanomaterials ( Kononenko et al., 2015 ). 
However, PS is less dense than water, and the cytotoxic properties required the use of culture 
techniques that allowed bilamellar particle exposure and accumulation of PS particles in 
cells (Watson et al., 2016).
Because of increased possibilities of exposures to components of plastic products, NCEH/
ATSDR has been tracking plasticizers (including phthalates) found in the urine of the 
general population reported in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) for 2003 – 2017 ( CDC, 2019 ). ATSDR has developed toxicological profiles 
addressing the health risks of several phthalates ( ATSDR, 1995 , 1997 , 2001 , 2002 ), 
including potential risks for reproductive and developmental toxicities in animals. Although 
no directly measured correlation exists between MP exposure and urinary phthalate 
metabolites, recent studies found a correlation between phthalate and MP concentrations in 
marine plankton and in sea water ( Baini et al., 2017 ; Paluselli et al., 2018, 2019). Several 
marine researchers have identified the potential for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and 
other toxicants to adsorb on micro-plastic surfaces (Prata et al., 2020; Bakir et al., 2014). 
Toxicants that had been adsorbed on fibers have been directly measured in occupational 
settings ( Burkhart et al., 1999 ). While this research is valuable for estimating the total risk 
from MPs and NPs in the environment, it is not essential to determine risk from POPs. 
Human biomonitoring currently provides exposure data on POPs from all sources ( CDC, 
2013  & 2019 ), while the total body burden of MP and NP remains unknown. Better Zarus et al. Page 9

environment.
Research gaps and next steps
In summary, humans are frequently exposed to MPs and NPs from multiple environmental 
sources. Some people are exposed to thousands of plastic fibers and particles per day or 
more from the environment. Health effects from MP-exposure have been demonstrated in 
workplace studies and in patients who have had erosion-wear of plastic implants, but these 
exposures cannot be compared with environmental exposures. Research gaps include 
differences in definitions, non-standardized sampling procedures, various analytical 
techniques, and limited studies quantifying human exposure, uptake, dose, and effects. Table 
4 identifies general data gaps in estimating human exposures (the top portion) or human 
uptake and absorption (on the bottom portion). It draws from the studies provided in the 
previous tables. The table is shaded to identify the most critical data gaps. The first row in 
the “Exposure Element” section of Table 4, for example, summarizes that while MP 
measured in air allows us to calculate a dose (provided in Table 1), that data does not include 
the NP concentration necessary to compare with health effects (as demonstrated in Table 2). 
The first row within the “Uptake and Absorption” section, identifies that lung tissue uptake 
is well demonstrated in workers, yet little is known in non-workers. Several analytical tools 
are currently available to fill many of these knowledge gaps and efforts to standardize 
methods are underway. By simply using worker fiber and particulate monitoring, we can 
measure and characterize non-worker air levels. Similar lung biopsies of deceased non-
workers may provide non-worker exposure impact data. Newer methods show promise for 
identifying uptake and impact to critical organs or tissues. In a recent report, MP (plastic 
monomers) were found in human liver and fat tissue analyzed using mass spectrometry 
(Rolsky 2020 ).
To address these gaps, NCEH/ATSDR has conducted several activities to advance MP and 
NP exposure methodology, including contributing to multiagency sampling guidelines and 
assisting universities with MP and NP sample collection. To further advance the science of 
MP public health, NCEH/ATSDR has developed a strategic plan and committed a small 
group of diverse scientists to prioritize and realize strategic objectives.
The NCEH/ATSDR team’s foremost objective is to characterize potential human health risks 
from MP and NP exposures by conducting a scoping review of the literature. In addition, we 
are investigating bioaccumulation of MPs and other organic pollutants. The investigation 
will include systematic review analyses to inform guidance on data quality objectives for 
human health. Both NCEH and ATSDR have experience in this work, which includes 
synthesizing literature for toxicological profiles, standardizing sampling and analytical 
methods to monitor exposures and their health effects and tracking national trends of 
environmental health exposures. Building upon results of the health risk characterization, we 
plan to coordinate with stakeholders to drive action-based microplastics interventions to 
protect human health. This includes national-level activities through our established 
organizational cooperatives and community-level activities as we work though our site-Zarus et al. Page 10

1988 ; Gennaro et al., 2008 )No exposures; injected microparticles circulated to liver 
(V olkheimer, 1975 ) Measured in liver and spleen of 
implant patients ( Urban et al. 2000 )None Not measured in workers, animals, 
or general population. But found in 
implant patients
Biomagnification of 
other toxicantsMeasured directly as a factor >1x in 
marine animals, but no support for 
great magnification is demonstratedMeasured in marine environment and in fish GI tracks 
indicate a decrease in the trophic levels, not an increase. 
Thus, the increase to humans is expected to be slight 
(NAS 2020)None Data in human food supply is 
needed; however, total exposure to 
many persistent pollutants occurs 
routinely
1.The table is shaded to assist in identifying the largest data gaps for assessing microplastic exposure and effect. Red, identifies the largest data needs, yellow identifies a need for further characterization, 
and green identifies that there is sufficient characterization to demonstrate an element exists. These qualitative rankings are explained throughout the text.2.Abbreviations: GI = Gastrointestinal system, MP = Microplastics, NP = Nanoplastics, PAE = phthalate esters, μm =micrometers
