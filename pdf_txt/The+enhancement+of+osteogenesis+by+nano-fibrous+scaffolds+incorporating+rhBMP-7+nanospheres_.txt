 Abstract 
Bioactive Nano-Fibrous Scaffolds for Bone and Carti lage Tissue Engineering 
by 
Kai Feng 
 
Chair: Peter X. Ma 
            Scaffolds that can mimic the structural  features of natural extracellular 
matrix and can deliver biomolecules in a controlled  fashion may provide cells with a 
favorable microenvironment to facilitate tissue reg eneration. Biodegradable nanofibrous 
scaffolds with interconnected pore network have pre viously been developed in our 
laboratory to mimic collagen matrix and advantageou sly support both bone and cartilage 
regeneration. This dissertation project aims to exp and both the structural complexity and 
the biomolecule delivery capacity of such biomimeti c scaffolds for tissue engineering. 
We first developed a nanofibrous scaffold that can release an antibiotic 
(doxycycline) with a tunable release rate and a tun able dosage, which was demonstrated 
to be able to inhibit bacterial growth over a prolo nged time period.  
We then developed a nanofibrous tissue-engineering scaffold that can release 
basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in a spatiall y and temporally controlled fashion. In 
a mouse subcutaneous implantation model, the bFGF-r eleasing scaffold was shown to xvi  
 enhance cell penetration, tissue ingrowth and angio genesis. It was also found that both 
the dose and the release rate of bFGF play roles in  the biologic function of the scaffold. 
After that, we developed a nanofibrous PLLA scaffol d that can release both bone 
morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) and platelet-derive d growth factor (PDGF) with 
distinct dosages and release kinetics. It was demon strated that BMP-7 and PDGF could 
synergistically enhance bone regeneration using a m ouse ectopic bone formation model 
and a rat periodontal fenestration defect regenerat ion model. The regeneration outcome 
was dependent on the dosage, the ratio and the rele ase kinetics of the two growth factors.       
Last, we developed an anisotropic composite scaffol d with an upper layer 
mimicking the superficial zone of cartilage and a l ower layer mimicking the middle zone 
of cartilage. The thin superficial layer was fabric ated using an electrospinning technique 
to support a more parallel ECM orientation to the c artilage surface. The lower layer was 
fabricated using a phase-separation technique to su pport a more isotropic ECM 
distribution. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal  stem cells (hMSCs) were seeded 
on this complex scaffold and cultured under chondro genic conditions. The results showed 
that the composite scaffold was indeed able to supp ort anisotropic cartilage tissue 
structure formation.

Introduction 
 
Background and motivation 
        Organ failure and tissue loss resulting fro m trauma and diseases remain major 
healthcare challenges in the United States. About o ne half of the national medical 
spending is attributed to the treatment of organ fa ilure and tissue loss with approximately 
8 million surgeries and 40-90 million hospital days  per year. [1-3] Although significant 
advances have been made in medical sciences and tec hnologies, organ failure and tissue 
loss are still treated with transplantation. In 200 8, 27,281 organ transplantation 
procedures were performed in the United States, whi le 100,597 patients were on waiting 
lists for organ transplantation. [4]There is a huge  gap between the number of people on 
the waiting list and the available organ number, an d many patients on the waiting list 
eventually die because of organ shortage.  Besides donor shortage, there are additional 
problems. For example, bone grafts and metallic/cer amic implants are two major 
treatments to bone loss. In the U.S, approximately 90% of bone grafts are autografts and 
allografts. [5]Donor site morbidity and pathogen tr ansmission are two major drawbacks 
associated with autografts and allografts, respecti vely. [6] Metallic/ceramic implants are 
different from native bone in structure and mechani cal properties, often leading to 
additional bone damage.  [7] 2 
         Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies the principle of 
engineering and life science to aim at constructing  biological substitutes to repair 
damaged tissue. In order to achieve satisfactory ti ssue regeneration, three key issues need 
to be considered: the isolation and cultivation of cells, the use of tissue-inductive 
biomolecules and the placement of cells in suitable  scaffolds to support 3-D tissue 
regeneration. [2] In a traditional tissue engineeri ng approach, cells are cultured and 
seeded on a scaffold and then implanted into the de fect site to form new tissue. [2] In this 
approach, the cells provide the main source for new  tissue regeneration. The scaffolds act 
as three-dimensional matrices for cell growth and d egrade away as the tissues are 
regenerated.[8] Despite the encouraging early resul ts[3, 9], the limited number of donor 
cells and low quality of regenerated tissues remain ed two hurdles in tissue engineering 
approach.  [10] Scaffolds are required to provide additional f unctions besides providing 
structure support and suitable degradation kinetics . Another approach is to implant 
acellular scaffold in the defect site with the capa bility of delivering appropriate 
biomolecules in a controlled manner, thereby recrui ting progenitor cells to the defect site 
and promoting cell proliferation and differentiatio n, inducing tissue regeneration. [2] 
Factor-releasing scaffolds are gaining popularity a nd have recently been used along with 
incorporated cells.  [11-14]These scaffolds are often called bioactive s caffolds.  [15, 16]         
        The main hypotheses of this thesis are: (1)  controlled delivery of  appropriate 
growth factors from nanofibrous scaffold will facil itate angiogenesis and osteogenesis 
leading to high quality bone regeneration; (2) the development of  structural complexity 
in scaffolds to mimic complicated natural extracell uar matrices in terms of pore 3 
 morphology, fiber, size and orientation will facili tate complex tissue regeneration. The 
specific Aims of this thesis are listed below:     
        1. To fabricate 3D nanofibrous scaffolds wi th the capacity of delivering a single 
biomolecule such as an antibiotic or growth factor,  characterize the in vitro  release 
profiles, and evaluate the biological function of t hese released biomolecules both in vitro  
and in vivo . Specifically, we focus on doxycycline-delivering scaffold to inhibit bacterial 
growth in vitro  and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-deliveri ng scaffold to promote 
tissue ingrowth and angiogenesis in vivo . 
        2. To fabricate 3D nanofibrous scaffold wit h capacity of delivering two growth 
factors and evaluate the effects on bone tissue reg eneration in vivo. Specifically, we 
focus on scaffolds releasing both bone  morphogenet ic protein 7 (BMP-7) and platelet-
derived growth factor (PDGF). The biological functi on of these scaffolds in bone 
regeneration will be first examined in a mouse subc utaneous implantation model. Several 
scaffolds with different dosage ratios and release rates of BMP-7 and PDGF will be 
implanted and the in vivo  bone regeneration will be evaluated to determine t he optimal 
release rate and dosage for each growth factor to a chieve the most synergetic effects. 
Then, the biological effectiveness of the scaffolds  with the optimal dosage ratio and 
release rates of two growth factors will be evaluat ed using a periodontal bone defect 
repair model. 
        3. To fabricate a 3D nanofibrous composite scaffold containing two layers with 
different fiber and pore morphologies and examine t he effect of this novel scaffold on 
complex tissue regeneration in vitro . Specifically, we will focus on the combination of  4 
 electrospinning and phase separation techniques to create composite scaffolds and 
examine the effects on chondrogenesis to zonal stru cture formation in vitro . 
 
Dissertation overview  
        Chapter 2 provides a general literature rev iew of the nanostructured biomaterials 
used in tissue regeneration. Emphasis is placed on two aspects: (1) nanofibrous scaffold 
fabrication techniques including electropsinning, s elf assembly and temperature induced 
phase separation, (2) growth factor delivery in var ious 3-D scaffolds.  
        Chapter 3 begins the research part of this thesis with the fabrication of novel 
antibacterial nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds. Here, ant ibiotic doxycycline is incorporated 
into PLGA nanospheres and the spheres are immobiliz ed onto nanofibrous PLLA 
scaffolds. The release profiles of doxycycline from  the scaffolds are examined and both 
short term and long term in vitro bacterial inhibit ion effect of the scaffolds are 
demonstrated.  This work was published in Journal of Controlled Release . [17] 
        Chapter 4 details the development of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-
containing nanospheres (NS) and their immobilizatio n onto nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds. 
In vitro  release profiles of bFGF from different PLGA nanos pheres on the scaffolds  are 
determined. Tissue ingrowth and angiogenesis into t hese scaffolds are studied in a 
subcutaneous implantation model. 
        Chapter 5 develops one single nano-fibrous scaffold capable of delivering two 
different growth factors (BMP-7and PDGF). The fabri cation method is described. The 5 
 ectopic bone formation in scaffolds with different BMP-7/PDGF dosages and release 
rates is examined. Two week and five week bone rege neration on these dual release 
scaffolds is investigated using a rat periodontal d efect model.  
        Chapter 6 creates an anisotropic composite scaffold to mimic zonal structure of 
cartilage tissue with a combination of electropinni ng and phase separation methods. In-
vitro  chondrogenesis of human bone marrow-derived mesenc hymal stem cells (hMSCs) 
on this scaffold  is studied. 
        The final chapter, chapter 7, summarizes th e thesis work with major conclusions and 
discusses some possible future directions related t o this dissertation.

Nanostructured biomaterials and growth factor deliv ery scaffold 
 
Introduction 
        Tissue engineering and Nanotechnology are t wo exciting science and engineering 
fields. They are both interdisciplinary among biolo gy, chemistry, physics, material 
science and medical science, etc. Tissue engineerin g applies the principles of engineering 
and the life science to the fabrication and develop ment of biological alternatives for 
harvested tissues and organ transplantation to rest ore, maintain or improve tissue function. 
[1] Three important factors exist in tissue enginee ring: cells, growth factors and 
biomaterials (scaffolds). Because cells need anchor age sites and specific environments 
for growth, biomaterials play a pivotal role in bot h in-vitro tissue culture and in vivo new 
tissue formation in tissue engineering. [2] They se rve as matrices for cellular ingrowth, 
proliferation, differentiation into functional form , and new tissue formation in three 
dimensions and eventually disappear over time. [3, 4] 
        With the advances of nanotechnology, materi al design can be exploited into the 
nanometer scale(1nm=10 -9m) and nano-structured biomaterials begin to emerge .[5] 
Among them, nano-fibrous biomaterials are exciting because their ability to the 
extracellular matrix (ECM), which contains abundant  fibrous collagen proteins (50-
500nm) [6-8] that regulates cell morphology, cytosk eletal structure and functionality. [9, 
10] The collagen like fibrillar structure of the na nofibrous biomaterials along with their 9 
 high surface to volume ratio enhances cell adhesion ,[6, 11-13] which in turn improve cell 
migration, proliferation, and differentiated functi on on these biomaterials. [14-16] 
Therefore, nanostructured biomaterials are becoming  increasingly important in tissue 
engineering. 
        Various biomolecules have been successfully  delivered from tissue engineering 
scaffolds. Growth factors (GFs) are one important g roup of such biomolecules. They are 
polypeptides that can modulate cellular growth, pro liferation and cellular differentiation 
involved in the regeneration of new tissues. [17, 1 8]. In order to achieve efficient 
biological functions of GFs, the release of GFs fro m scaffolds should be in a controlled 
manner to reach suitable therapeutic dosage and dur ation. [19] The bioactivity of growth 
factors should be preserved after the incorporation  within the scaffolds. The release 
should occur over a needed time period and the rele ase should be localized to avoid 
potential side effects.  
        In this chapter we will discuss three cutti ng edge technologies to fabricate 
nanostructured biomaterials: Self assembly, Electro spinning, Phase separation. We will 
also discuss inorganic/organic nanocomposite biomat erials. Finally we will summarize 
current advances in technologies to incorporate gro wth factor delivery systems into three 
major types of scaffolds used in tissue engineering  application including hydrogel 
scaffold, electrospun scaffold and  three dimension  (3D) porous scaffold. 
 
Nanofibrous biomaterials  
Self assembly 10 
 Molecular self assembly is defined as the spontaneo us organization of molecules 
under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions into str ucturally well-defined and rather 
stable arrangements through a number of noncovalent  interactions. [20-23] These 
interactions typically involve secondary bonding.[2 3]  
Fields, Tirrell and co-workers have designed peptid e-amphiphiles (PAs) molecules 
by self assembly to mimic the triple-helix super se condary structure of collagen 
molecules. The PA consists of a Î±1 (IV) 1263-1277 collagen sequence head group which  
is covalently linked to a mono- or di-alkyl ester l ipid tail. [24-28]  Later, Fields and co-
workers also developed a chimeric PA incorporating a 21 residue angiogenesis-inducing 
peptide sequence (SPARC) to enhance cell proliferat ion and angiogenesis. [29]  
Beyond this single molecular unit, nanofibrous mate rials can be made by self 
assembly too. Zhang, and co-workers synthesized ion ic self-complementary 
oligopeptides with regular alternating ionic hydrop hilic and hydrophobic residue peptides, 
which can form stable Î²-sheets.[30-32] When subjected to monovalent alkali ne cations or 
physiological conditions, these oligopeptides can s elf assemble into macroscopic 
hydrogel structures which contain nanofibers about 10-20 nm in diameter. [33-35] It was 
found out that certain cells can attach to, prolife rate and differentiate on this hydrogel.

Stupp and co-workers have synthesized peptide amphi philes (PA) by living anionic 
polymerization that can self assemble to form nanof iber structure of a hydrogel. [36-38] 
The forming nanofibers have diameter approximately 5-8 nm and length up to several 
micrometers. [36, 37] In these nanofibers, the PA m olecules are perpendicular to the fiber 11 
 axis, which is different from the natural collagen matrix having collagen molecules 
parallel to each other. [39] 
In summary, self assembly peptide systems can gener ate nanofibers in the lowest 
end of natural extracellular matrix collagen fiber diameter range, while they are either 
single molecules or hydrogels.[39] Some properties need to be improved such as pore 
structure and material degradation rate control, ce ll-material interaction, mechanical 
strengthening. 
 
Electrospinning 
        âElectrospinningâ has existed in the litera ture for more than 100 years. [40] 
Recently, it has gained much more attention in biom edical engineering due to its ability 
to produce fibers whose diameters can be reduced to  nanometer range.   
The basic experimental setup of electrospinning inc ludes: (1) applied voltage (2) 
grounded target collector (3) polymer reservoir wit h a spinneret. Once the applied 
electrical force overcomes the surface tension of t he polymer solution or melt, a charged 
jet forms from the pendent solution surface called âTaylorâs coneâ [41] and travels in a 
straight line for a certain distance. Then, an elec trically driven bending instability grows 
to cause the jet to bend and follow a whipping and spiraling path, which reduces the jet 
diameter. In the final stage, the solution jet evap orates, solidifies and is collected as a 
non-woven fiber mats on the stationary grounded col lector [42-44]or rotating target if 
fiber orientation is needed.[45, 46] 
Several natural biopolymers[46-49]and synthetic bio degradable polymers[50-
56]have been successfully electrospun into nanofibr ous scaffolds. The diameters of these 12 
 electrospun fibers can be down to nanometer size, w hile electrospun fibers of FDA 
approved biodegradable polymers usually have diamet ers in micrometer range[50, 52-54, 
56]. However, the porosity of electrospun matrices is usually not very high and the pore 
shape is random.[57] A variety of cells were report ed to attach and proliferate well on 
these scaffolds and some have been shown to differe ntiate into or maintain their 
functional phenotypes as well.[46, 52, 54, 56, 58-6 1] As fiber diameter decreases, cell 
interaction improves and immune response decreases.  [62]  
Though there are some untamed challenges with elect rospinning technology such as 
difficulty to control pore size and shape and its l ow porosity, the simplicity makes it 
widely used to fabricate nanofibrous scaffolds. 
 
Phase separation 
As a scaffold fabrication method, phase separation is a process that a homogenous 
polymer solution system becomes thermodynamically u nstable and phase separates into 
two phases in order to lower the system free energy  under certain conditions. One phase 
is a polymer rich phase while the other is a polyme r lean phase. After the solvent is 
removed, the polymer-rich phase solidifies. 
 Conventional phase separation process though very useful in fabricating porous 
membrane for filtration and separation, is not suit able for tissue scaffold fabrication. [63] 
So, Controlled phase separation, primarily thermall y induced phase separation (TIPS) has 
been used to fabricate polymeric scaffolds for tiss ue engineering. [4, 64-71] Liquid-liquid 
phase separation, one of the TIPS, occurs when the crystallization temperature is much 
lower than the phase separation temperature. Combin ing liquid-liquid phase separation 13 
 with gelation process [72, 73], nanofibrous matrice s mimicking natural type I collagen 
(Fig.2.1) were fabricated in our lab. The fibers di ameters are ranged from 50 to 500 nm 
and the porosity of the matrices can be as high as 98%.[71] The morphology of the 
matrices is mainly determined by gelation condition , [4] while other processing 
parameters such as polymer molecular weight, polyme r solution concentration, solvent 
exchange and quenching temperature will also affect  the morphology of the matrices. [71]   
Open macropore (>100 Âµm) structure can be incorporated into nanofibrous m atrices by 
combining porogen leaching technique or solid Freef orm Fabrication techniques (SFF). 
Five steps are involved in the porogen leaching-pha se separation process: Polymer  
dissolution, porogen assembly, polymer solution cas ting,  phase- separation and gelation, 
porogen leaching. Porogens used in our lab are salt  or sugar particle[71, 74], sugar 
fibers[71], sugar microspheres[75-77], paraffin mic rospheres[66]. These matrices have 
very low density and even higher porosity which con tains both open pore structure and 
nanofibrous wall. (Fig.2.2) These macropores in the  matrices facilitate cell seeding, cell 
migration inside and neovascularization after in vi vo scaffold implantation.  
Solid freeform fabrication (SFF) is a process that uses a computer aided design 
(CAD) program to create 3-D structured objects, whi le reversed SFF is used to design a 
3-D negative mold which is then created layer-by-la yer on a 3-D printer. Due to its ability 
to well control the scaffold geometric parameter su ch as external shape, pore geometries 
and pore interconnectivity, SFF has become more and  more popular in scaffolding 
fabrication nowadays. [78, 79] Combining SFF and TI PS, nano-fibrous scaffold with 
complex geometry mimicking human organ can be fabri cated. Nanofibrous human ear 
and mandible segment scaffolds were created from 3- D reconstruction of CT-scans or 14 
 histological section in our lab (Fig.2.3). Cell stu dies of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts showed 
significant better proliferation and higher express ion of osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein 
mRNAs on NF scaffolds. [80]  
Nanofibrous scaffolds have been shown to have bette r cell attachment than solid-
walled scaffolds due to more cell adhesion proteins  absorbance. [81] Osteoblasts were 
cultured on both nanofibrous and solid-walled PLLA scaffolds and cells on nanofibrous 
scaffolds showed higher alkaline phosphatase activi ty and an earlier and enhanced gene 
expression of the osteoblast phenotype. Biominerali zation was 13-fold enhanced on 
nanofibrous scaffolds in terms of calcium content a ssay. Cell seeded on nanofibrous 
scaffolds sustained expression of Î±-2 integrin when the formation of collagen fibril b y 
osteoblasts was inhibited, while cells seed on soli d-walled scaffolds failed to do so. These 
results demonstrated that nanofibrous matrices proc esses some natural collagen fibers 
property and is a better scaffolding than solid-wal l scaffolds for promoting osteoblast 
differentiation and biomineralization.[82] 
        In summary, TIPS does not involve complicat ed PA synthesis and purification 
processes as in self aasembly, nor does it require any facilities in electrospinning. 
However, it provides a great deal of control and di versity in the nanofibrous biomaterials 
fabricated from external shape to macropore structu re and to fiber diameter. Their 
interconnected spherical macro-pore network promote s cell penetration. Their 
nanofibrous architecture mimics natural extracellul ar matrix to promote cell attachment, 
proliferation, differentiation of multiple cell typ es. [83-86] With these beneficial features, 
these three dimensional porous scaffolds have found  applications in regeneration of 
various tissues. [86-90]  15 
 Nanocomposite biomaterials  
The combination of improved mechanical properties a nd biocompatibility is the 
goal of nanocomposite biomaterials design. Bone, on e of mineralized tissues in human 
body, is a perfect example of natural nanocomposite  with nanometer sized platelike 
apatite crystals dispersed in collagen nanofibrous network. Its good mechanical property 
comes from both the nanometer feature of the collag en fiber and apatite crystal and 
composite organization of these two contents. [91, 92]  
To mimic the nanoscale feature of mineral component  of the bone, hydroxyaptite 
nanoparticle(nHAP), which is the major mineral phas e in natural bone and has good 
osteoconductivity and bone bonding ability, was pre cipitated onto collagen to form a 
porous composite scaffold. [93, 94] Interfacial new  bone formation by osteoblasts and 
composite degradation were observed on these compos ite scaffolds. [95, 96] In order to 
avoid pathogen transmission and immunorejection, sy nthetic biodegradable polymers 
were used as the organic component of the composite  instead. By using TIPS, 
nHAP/poly( Î±-hydroxy acids) composite scaffolds with high poros ity (>90%) were 
fabricated. By varying phase separation parameters,  different morphology like tubular 
and platelet like can be achieved. If a dioxane/wat er mixture solvent system was used, 
nHAP-PLLA composite scaffold developed a nanofibrou s morphology (shown in Fig 2.4) 
which greatly improve the mechanical properties and  protein adsorption capacity of the 
scaffolds. [97] Fibronectin and vitronection adsorp tion was increased which is very 
important for preventing apatotic cell death in the se composite scaffolds. [98] It is 
believed that nHAP increased hydrophilicity, surfac e roughness and total surface area 
which altogether increase protein adsorption and os teoblast adhesion. [99-101] When 16 
 macropores were introduced into the scaffold, bone- like apatite deposited onto the 
composite scaffold in a simulated body fluid (SBF) (Fig.2.5). The resulting composite 
scaffolds mimics bone matrix and is desirable for b one tissue engineering. [75] 
 
Growth factor delivery scaffold 
Growth factor delivery from hydrogel scaffold 
        Hydrogel scaffold are frequently used to engineer h ighly metabolic soft tissues, for 
which the load bearing capacity is less demanding b ut the high permeability of oxygen 
and nutrients are desirable. [102, 103]  
        Four major techniques have been applied to deliver growth factors from hydrogel 
scaffolds including: direct incorporation, micropar ticle encapsulation, covalent 
attachment and enzymatically cleavable tether attac hment. [104]  
        The typical release profile of direct incor poration of growth factors into hydrogels 
consists of  a rapid burst release during hydrogel initial swelling phase followed by an 
extended release of protein retarded by hydrogel po lymer crosslink network. [105] Since 
a hydrogel contains more than 90% water in weight, the diffusion of incorporated growth 
factors is mainly determined by the growth factor s ize relative to chemical or physical 
crosslink density between polymer chains. [102, 106 ] Several attempts have been made to 
adjust crosslink density to alter these release pro files. [107-110] A slower release rate can 
be achieved by introducing charged polymers such as  gelatin to interact with the 
incorporated growth factor (e.g., vascular endothel ial growth factor, VEGF) via 
oppositely charged functional groups. [111] Concern s for this approach include the 
denature of growth factors due tochemical cross-lin king if they are loaded into a hydrogel 17 
 before crosslinking or the uneven distribution of t he growth factors if they are loaded into 
hydrogel after the cross-linking. [104] 
        Microparticle encapsulation system made fro m hydrophobic non-swelling 
polymers[112], solid lipids[113], hydrophilic polym ers[105, 114]were incorporated into 
hydrogel system to further alter the release profil e of growth factor from hydrogel 
scaffold.  Transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF- Î²1) was encapsulated into hydrophilic 
cross-linked gelatin microparticles incorporated in to hydrogels. The growth factor release 
profile depends on the degradation of the used micr opartiles, which allow multiple 
growth factors to be released at distinct release r ates by using different gelatin 
microparticles. [115] 
        Besides, growth factors can also be incorpo rated into hydrogels by covalent 
attachment [116, 117] and enzymatically cleavable t ether attachment. [118, 119] In one 
example, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was successfully covalent bonded to PEG 
hydrogel. When covalently immobilized bFGF gradient  was introduced, cells on the 
hydrogel aligned along the direction of increasing bFGF concentration. [116] These 
designed hydrogels with attached growth factors wil l be useful in many tissue 
engineering applications, while concerns about the stability of the attached growth factors 
remains. [104] 
 
Growth factor delivery from electrospun scaffold 
        Due to their wide variety of material choic es and fabrication simplicity, electrospun 
scaffolds have been applied in multiple types of ti ssues regeneration. [120-124]However, 18 
 this technique remains difficult to create macro-po re network and complex 3D shapes for 
large size tissue regeneration. [125-127] 
        In general, four major techniques have been  used to incorporate growth factors into 
electrospun scaffolds, including physical adsorptio n [128, 129], blend electrospinning 
(emulsion electrospinning) [129-132], coaxial elect rospinning [131, 133, 134], and 
covalent immobilization[135].  
        Physical adsorption is the easiest way to l oad growth factors into an electrospun 
scaffold, which is simply dip the scaffold into an aqueous growth factor aqueous solution. 
Bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) was incorporated  into PLGA scaffolds using this 
method. [128, 129] The major disadvantage of this a pproach is the uncontrolled release 
profile and a very short release duration. 
        Blending electrospinning approach mixes gro wth factor within the polymer solution 
and electrospinning the mixed solution into a hybri d scaffold with growth factors 
localized within the fibers of the scaffold. This a pproach is also called " emulsion 
electrospinning" when growth factor is emulsified i nto polymer solution by ultra-
sonication or homogenization. [136-139]Compared to physical adsorption, blend 
electrospinning approach usually results in a more sustained growth factor release from 
scaffold which can last over several weeks. A typic al growth factor release profile from 
blend electrospun scaffold consists of an initial b urst release followed a sustained release. 
[128, 140] BMP-2 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were incorporated into scaffold 
using this approach. [129, 130, 132] The major disa dvantage of this approach is the loss 
of bioactivity of the incorporated growth factors d ue to their conformational changes in 
the organic solution environment or under harsh mix ing conditions. [141] Several 19 
 strategies have been applied to address this issue including addition of hydrophilic 
polymers such as poly(ethylene glyco) (PEG) in the aqueous growth factor solution to 
improve protein stability [130, 142]and addition of  hydrophilic hydroxyapatite (HAP) 
particle to attach growth factors, reducing the dam age of harsh electrospinning process. 
[129] 
        Coaxial electrospinning, also called co-ele ctrospinning, can produce growth factor 
containing composite nano-fibers with core-shell st ructures by coaxially and 
simultaneously electrospinning a growth factor solu tion and a polymer solution through 
different feeding capillary channels in one needle.  [143, 144] The growth factor release 
profile from coaxial electrospun scaffolds is simil ar to that from blend electrospun 
scaffolds, consisting of two stages. [131] However,  the burst release is significantly lower 
and the release duration is prolonged, [145, 146]be cause the growth factors are mainly 
incorporated and distributed in the core part. The polymer shell provides a barrier 
membrane that controls the protein diffusion rate. [145]Introduction of porogens in the 
polymer shell is able to further adjust the growth factor release profile from the coaxial 
electrospun scaffold. [147]Platelet-derived growth factor-b (PDGF-bb) [133, 134], nerve 
growth factor (NGF) [148] and fibroblast growth fac tor (FGF) [131] have been 
encapsulated in coaxially electrospun scaffolds. 
        Covalent immobilization introduces chemical  bond to immobilize growth factors on 
the electrospun fiber surface. Epidermal growth fac tor (EGF) was delivered from 
electrospun scaffold using this strategy. [135] Due  to its technical complexity and 
possible loss of scaffold uniformity, it has not be en a routine approach to delivery growth 
factors from electrospun scaffolds.         20 
         Besides these four major approaches discuss ed above, microsphere(MS)/nanosphere 
(NS) encapsulation were also explored to deliver gr owth factor from electrospun 
scaffolds. However, this method is uncommon due to technique difficulty associated with 
electrospun scaffold's limited pore size. Electrosp rying and electrospinning techniques 
were combined to incorporate insulin-like growth fa ctor-containing MS into an 
electrospun PLGA nanofibrous scaffold. [149] In ano ther case, a poly(caprolactone) 
(PCL) jet and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) jet with  pre-fabricated MS were both 
electrospun onto a common mandrel and the MS were e ntrapped within the PCL scaffold 
after PEO was removed. [150] 
 
Growth factor delivery from three dimensional (3-D)  porous scaffold 
         Several techniques have been applied to in corporate and deliver growth factor from 
three dimensional (3-D) porous scaffolds, including  direct encapsulation, passive 
absorption, coating and microsphere (MS)/nanosphere  (NS) encapsulation.   
         Osteotropic factors were mixed with PLGA e mulsion and directly encapsulated 
inside PLGA porous scaffold walls during an emulsio n freeze-drying scaffold fabrication 
process. [151] Bone morphogenetic protein-2 release d from such scaffold enhanced 
ectopic bone formation in rats. [152] While it comb ined the scaffold fabrication and 
growth factor incorporation into one single step, h owever, the scaffolds' structure, 
mechanical properties are altered and growth factor  release rate depends on scaffold bulk 
degradation rates which may not be ideal for some t issue engineering applications. In an 
alternative method, pre-fabricated porous scaffold  was immersed in a protein solution to 
passively absorb the proteins on the surface of sca ffold. [153] However, the release 21 
 profile of growth factor from a scaffold is not con trolled, resulting in a very short release 
period. The growth factors are not protected, resul ting in their denaturation and failure to 
achieve the desired biological effects.  [153] Poly mer emulsion coating method is also 
used to coat growth factors on the surface of pre-f abricated porous scaffold. The 
bioactivity of the growth factor is protected and t he release time period is extended by the 
introduction of a protective polymer layer. However , the porous structure of the scaffold 
is altered by the coating process. [154, 155] 
        In order to overcome these shortcomings ass ociated with the above discussed 
methods of growth factor incorporation into scaffol ds, our lab developed techniques to 
encapsulate growth factors into polymer microsphere  (MS)/nanosphere (NS) and then to 
immobilize these spheres onto the nanofibrous pore surface of pre-fabricated 
scaffolds.[156, 157]  The typical procedures contai n two steps: First, an aqueous growth 
factor solution is mixed with a PLGA polymer soluti on to encapsulate growth factor 
domains into PLGA spheres using a water-in-oil-in-w ater double emulsion process. [158, 
159] The sphere size ranges from nanometers to micr ometer depending on the emulsion 
process parameters such as surfactant concentration  and emulsion strength applied. [160] 
Then these obtained growth factor-containing PLGA M S/NS are immobilized onto the 
inner nanofibrous pore surface of a pre-fabricated scaffold using a post-seeding 
method.[156, 157] This novel MS/NS encapsulation me thod offers several advantages 
over other scaffold growth factor delivery systems.  First, the scaffold fabrication process 
is separated from the growth factor incorporation p rocess. Thus, the macro-porous 
architecture, the mechanical and degradation proper ties of the scaffold are not altered.  
The release of growth factors and the degradation o f the scaffold can be individually 22 
 optimized. Second, polymeric MS/NS have been widely  applied to encapsulate bioactive 
molecules and their ability to protect the encapsul ated bioactive molecules from 
denaturation and degradation has been demonstrated.  [161, 162] Third, the release of 
growth factors released from the scaffolds are in a  temporally controlled fashion, which is 
primarily determined by the chemical and degradatio n properties of MS/NS polymer 
formulation. The release of the encapsulated protei ns takes two phases, with the first 
phase mainly controlled by diffusion and the second  phase mainly controlled by polymer 
degradation. Various release duration from several days to months can be easily achieved 
by adjusting polymer formulations such as PLGA copo lymer LA/GA ratio or/and the 
molecular weight of the copolymer, showed in Fig.2. 6. Fourth, the immobilization of 
MS/NS on porous NF scaffolds can reduce the burst r elease of growth factors and 
prolong the release duration. [156]  
 
Summary 
    Although nanostructured biomaterials are relati vely new scientific and engineering 
field, they have developed rapidly over recent year s. Nanofibrous biomaterials, 
nanocomposite biomaterials, micro- and nanospheres discussed herein and have had 
significant impacts on the tissue engineering and r egenerative medicine fields. In 
literature, electrospinning and phase separation te chniques have been used individually to 
fabricate nanofibrous scaffolds. In this thesis, a new nanofibrous scaffold will be 
fabricated using the combination of these two techn iques to mimic more complex tissue 
structure, which will be discussed in Chapter 6. In  literature, single growth factor has 
been released from nanofibrous PLLA nanofibrous sca ffold. In this thesis, release of 23 
 small molecule drugs from nanofibrous scaffold will  be discussed in Chapter 3 and dual 
release of growth factors from nanofibrous scaffold  will be discussed in Chapter5. 24

 Chapter 3 
Novel antibacterial nanofibrous PLLA scaffold 
 
Introduction 
        Chronic inflammation diseases caused by bac terial infection such as periodontitis 
and septic arthritis remain common in the United St ates and throughout the world. For 
example, approximately half of the adult population  in the US suffers chronic 
periodontitis. This disease is initiated by pathoge nic infection on the toothâs surface as a 
microbial biofilm which gradually leads to the dest ruction of the periodontal tissue, 
supporting alveolar bone, and eventually leading to  tooth loss. [1] In the treatment of 
periodontitis, antibiotics such as tetracycline (TC L) and metronidazole have been 
frequently used.  
        Doxycycline (DOXY) is a well known broad-sp ectrum antibiotic, which is effective 
against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacter ia, protozoa, and various anaerobes. 
[2] As a tetracycline analogue, it can work as a ba cteriostatic which is capable of 
inhibiting the bacterial protein synthesis at the r ibosomal sites. [3] Compared to TCL, 
DOXY has certain advantages such as a longer half-l ife, higher lipid solubility, and 
greater oral absorption. [4] It also shows strong i nhibition of matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMPs) both in vitro  and in clinical studies. [5-9] After being introdu ced to the clinical 
area in 1967[10], DOXY has been frequently used in treating destructive periodontal 
diseases such as juvenile periodontitis and acute p eriodontal abscesses. It has been used 45 
 against periodontal infection and enhancing bone re generation after periodontal disease.  
[11] It has also been used to prevent bacterial inf ection related to septic arthritis. [10, 12] 
However, there are some concerns over possible side  effects such as gastro-intestinal 
disturbance, esophageal erosion, and photosensitivi ty when administrated orally [4, 13-
17]. Therefore, in order to reach the site of infec tion in deep tissues with an effective drug 
concentration and to cirmvent the systemic side eff ects, controlled localized delivery of 
DOXY is desired. 
        Many attempts have been made in the area of  controlled delivery of the DOXY/TCL 
family and certain progress has been achieved. Drug  encapsulation methods such as 
mixing, emulsification, and electrospinning have be en used. Delivery systems in the 
forms of particles, stripes, hollow fibers, gels, a nd cements have been fabricated. [18-
24]However, most systems release all the encapsulat ed DOXY from hours up to 2 weeks. 
While a high initial burst release is acceptable fo r a highly hydrophilic antibiotic such as 
DOXY/TCL in order to immediately achieve effective concentration, it is also necessary 
to attain a long term sustained release to fight ag ainst chronic infection and avoid 
repeated local drug administration. How to achieve both reduced initial burst and 
extended release duration remains a challenge.  
        Controlled release of proteins has been wid ely investigated. [25-30] Our laboratory 
has previously developed a novel growth factor deli very system. The growth factors were 
encapsulated into PLGA nanospheres and the nanosphe res were then incorporated into 
three dimensional (3-D) macro-porous and nano-fibro us PLLA scaffolds. [31-33] The 
function of this delivery system is two fold: First , it serves as an osteoconductive scaffold. 
With its suitable pore structure and nano-fibrous s tructure similar to collagen, it improves 46 
 cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation.  [34, 35] Second, it stimulates 
vascularization or bone formation by localized cont rolled delivery of a bioactive 
angiogenic or osteogenic growth factor. [31, 32] In  this paper, we incorporated DOXY-
containing PLGA nanospheres into the nano-fibrous s caffolds to evaluate their anti-
bacterial capacity. The combination of the osteocon ductive properties of the macro-
porous and the nano-fibrous scaffold with its abili ty to release antibiotics could be a good 
candidate for local treatment of oral and periodont al diseases. 
 
Materials and methods  
Materials 
        Doxycycline hyclate, D-fructose, mineral oi l, and sorbitanmonooleate (span 80) 
were obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Compa ny (St. Louis, MO). PLGA 
copolymers with LA/GA ratio of 50:50 (Lakeshore Bio materialsâ¢, PLGA50-6.5K, Mw 
= 6.5 kDa; PLGA50-64K, Mw = 64KDa); PLGA copolymers  with a LA/GA ratio of 
75:25 (Lakeshore Biomaterialsâ¢, PLGA75-113K, Mw = 1 13 kDa) and the PLGA 
copolymers with a LA/GA ratio of 85:15 (Lakeshore B iomaterialsâ¢, PLGA85-142K, 
Mw = 142 kDa) were purchased from SurModics Pharmac euticals Inc. (Birmingham, 
AL). Poly( L-lactic acid) (PLLA) with inherent viscosity of 1.6  dl/g was purchased from 
Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany). Poly(acr ylic acid) (M W = 5000) and 
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (88 mol% hydrolyzed, M W = 25,000) were obtained from 
Polysciences Inc. Hexaglyceryl polyricinolate (Hexa glyn PR-15) was provided by the 
Barnet Products Corp (Englewood Cliffs, NJ). Aceton itrile and petroleum ether (BP 60-47 
 95 Â°C) were obtained from Acros Organic (Morris Pla ins, NJ). Dichloromethane (DCM), 
cyclohexane, hexane, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Fish erbrand regenerated cellulose 
dialysis bags (nominal MWCO 3500) were purchased fr om Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, 
PA). 
 
DOXY containing PLGA nanospheres (NS) and NS-incorp orated nano-fibrous 
scaffold (NS-scaffold) preparation  
        Doxycycline-containing PLGA NS were fabrica ted using a modified water-in-oil-in-
oil (w/o/o) emulsion method [36, 37]. Briefly, 80 m g PLGA was dissolved in 1 ml 
solvent mixture of acetonitrile/DMC (3:2 in volume ratio). 100 Âµl aqueous solution of 
certain amount of DOXY was added into the above sol ution and emulsified with a probe 
sonicator at 50 W (Virsonic 100, Gardiner, NY). Thi s primary w/o emulsion was then 
emulsified into 30 ml of mineral oil containing 4% hexaglyceryl polyricinolate under 
sonication at 90 W to form the w/o/o emulsion. The resulting secondary emulsion was 
magnetically stirred at room temperature for 12 h t o evaporate the solvents. The spheres 
were collected by centrifugation and washed three t imes with petroleum ether and freeze 
dried. Four PLGA formulations: PLGA50-6.5K, PLGA50- 64K, PLGA75-113K and 
PLGA85-142K were used for the in vitro  release study. The macro-porous PLLA nano-
fibrous scaffolds with dimensions of 7.2 mm in diam eter and 2 mm in thickness were 
prefabricated by a combination of phase separation and sugar leaching techniques 
previously described [33]. The PLGA NS were incorpo rated onto PLLA scaffolds using a 
post seeding method {Wei, 2006 #6; Wei, 2007 #5}. B riefly, PLGA NS were dispersed 
in hexane with 0.1% span 80 and were seeded onto NS -scaffolds drop wise. Then, the 48 
 scaffolds were subject to vapor of a mixed solvent of hexane/THF (volume ratio 9:1) for 
30 min. The scaffolds were vacuum-dried for 3 days to remove the solvent. 
 
Characterization of PLGA NS and NS-scaffolds 
        The morphology and size of the nanospheres and the scaffolds (before and after NS 
incorporation) were examined using scanning electro n microscopy (Philips XL30 FEG 
SEM). The nanospheres were dispersed in hexane and deposited onto a metal stub. SEM 
figures of these spheres were taken after gold coat ing. Average diameters of all type of 
PLGA spheres studied were calculated based on the s izes measured from the SEM 
images using ImageJ software (National Institutes o f Health). The sizes of PLGA50-6.5K 
and PLGA85-142K spheres were also measured by dynam ic light scattering (DLS) in an 
aqueous solution for comparison (Delsa Nano C Parti cle Size Analyzer, Beckman Coulter 
Inc). The drug content and encapsulation efficiency  were determined by UV 
spectrophotometric analysis. Briefly, 10 mg DOXY-en capsulated nanospheres (or one 
NS-scaffold) were dissolved in dichloromethane. The n, 10 ml PBS was added to extract 
DOXY. The extraction process was repeated several t imes. The solution was filtered 
through a 0.45 Âµm filter to remove polymer debris and then the DOXY  concentration was 
measured using a UV spectrophotometer (Hitachi U291 0) at the Î»max  value of 274 nm. 
PBS was used as the control. 49 
 In vitro drug release studies 
        The release profiles of DOXY loaded NS or N S-scaffolds with four PLGA 
formulations were investigated in PBS (0.1 M). 10 m g NS were suspended in 1 ml PBS 
and placed within a dialysis bag. The dialysis bag was kept in a glass flask containing 20 
ml PBS. One NS-scaffold was suspended in 1 ml PBS i n a glass vial. Both the glass vial 
and the glass flask were covered in aluminum foil a nd shaken at 50 rpm at 37 Â°C. At 
designated time points (1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28,  35, 42 days), the release medium was 
withdrawn and replaced with pre-warmed fresh PBS. T he released amounts of DOXY 
were analyzed using a UV spectrophotometer at the Î»max  value of 274 nm [22]. For 
DOXY release through the dialysis bag from NS alone , PBS was used as the control. For 
DOXY release from NS-incorporated scaffolds, blank PLGA NS (without DOXY) were 
immobilized onto the scaffolds and were used as the  controls. The absorbance values of 
the controls were subtracted from those of the DOXY  containing samples. 
 
In vitro antibacterial activity of NS-scaffold 
        The antibacterial assay was performed as pr eviously described [38]. The overnight 
incubated bacteria solution ( S. aureus  and E. coli ) was diluted with sterile MÃ¼ellerâ
Hinton Broth and reached an absorbance value betwee n 0.1 and 0.2 at 625 nm (equivalent 
to 0.5 McFarland standard). First, the bacterial cl one formation assay was performed 
using the MÃ¼ellerâHinton agar (1.5%) plate. The sca ffolds with or without DOXY 
nanospheres were placed in the center of the meltin g agar just before solidification. The 
DOXY was allowed to diffuse from the scaffold into the agar for 4 h before 100 ÂµL 50 
 inoculum was spread over the agar plate. The plates  were incubated at 37 Â°C for 5 days. 
The bacterial growth on plates was visualized direc tly on the plate. Second, the released 
drug solutions, collected from different scaffold g roups at different time points, were 
mixed with 2X MÃ¼ellerâHinton Broth and overnight in oculum (the bacterial final 
absorbance value was around 0.1 at 625 nm). All tes ted solutions were incubated at 37 Â°C 
on a shaker (50 rpm). The absorbance at 625 nm was monitored after 12 h of incubation. 
The percentage of bacterial inhibition was calculat ed using the following equation. 
Bacterial inhibition (%) = abs( Ic â Is)/( Ic) Ã 100, where Ic and Is are the absorbances of the 
control bacterial solution without drug and bacteri al solutions with released drug 
respectively at 625 nm after 12 h [38]. 
 
Results 
PLGA nanospheres loaded PLLA nano-fibrous scaffolds  
        PLGA NS prepared from a modified w/o/o doub le emulsion process were of smooth 
surface (Figure 3.1A). The combination of the phase  separation and sugar sphere 
templating techniques allowed the formation of PLLA  scaffolds with a high porosity 
(98%), multi-level pore structures and nano-fibrous  architecture of the pore walls. The 
scaffolds prepared for this study have regular sphe rical macro-pores 250â425 Âµm in 
diameter with well interconnected inter-pore openin gs of â¼ 100 Âµm (Figure 3.1B). The 
scaffold walls are entirely made of the PLLA nanofi bers with the diameter range of 50â
500 nm (Figure 3.1C), which is similar in size to n ative collagen fibers. Figure 3.1D and 51 
 Figure 3.1E show a cross section of the scaffolds a fter the DOXY loaded NS 
incorporation, and the pore wall surface at a highe r magnification. From SEM 
observation, it is clear that the macro-pores and i nter-pore opening structure of the 
scaffolds were well preserved and the nanospheres w ere uniformly distributed throughout 
the nano-fibrous pore walls. 
        Four different PLGA NS formulations were ex amined for encapsulation efficiency 
and release behavior. Two of the copolymers had the  same LA/GA ratio of 50/50 but 
different molecular weights, PLGA50-6.5K (Mw: 6.5 K ) and PLGA50-64K (Mw: 64 K). 
The other two had different LA/GA ratios: PLGA75-11 3K with a LA/GA ratio of 75/25 
(Mw: 113 K) and PLGA85-142K with a LA/GA ratio of 8 5/15 (Mw:142 K). The effects 
of processing parameters such as polymer concentrat ion, volume ratio of drug solution to 
inner oil phase (w/o 1), volume ratio of inner oil to outer oil phase (o 1/o 2), the addition of 
PAA on the DOXY encapsulation efficiency (EE) of PL GA85-142K NS are presented in 
Table 3.1. It was observed that the EE of DOXY incr eased with an increase in the 
polymer concentration from 3% to 8%, no significant  difference between 8% and 10%. 
With the increase of aqueous drug volume, the encap sulation efficiency decreased. The 
higher polymer concentration may entrap the aqueous  DOXY droplets more efficiently 
(higher EE), while the greater aqueous DOXY volume destabilizes the emulsion (lower 
EE). The increase in the volume ratio of outer oil phase to inner oil phase did not change 
EE significantly. It was found that the addition of  poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as a co-
encapsulation factor did not have significant effec t on the EE of the DOXY. 52 
         The diameter and the DOXY encapsulation eff iciency of NS of four PLGA 
formulations with the same other processing paramet ers are listed in Table 3.2. Based on 
SEM measurement, the average diameter of the sphere s increased with the increase of 
LA/GA ratio and/or PLGA molecular weight, with PLGA 50-6.5K NS had the smallest 
diameter of 300 nm and PLGA85-142K NS had the large st diameter of 730 nm. Based on 
DLS measurement, the diameter of PLGA50-6.5K NS and  PLGA85-142K NS was 400 
nm and 890 nm respectively in aqueous solution, pos sibly due to some degree of swelling 
or/and certain discrepancy between the two differen t methods. The changes in size and 
shape of similar PLGA spheres in aqueous solution o ver long-term culture were reported 
previously by our lab [39] and others [36]. Such PL GA spheres swelled first and then 
deformed from their original spherical shape into i rregular shape with a rough surface 
texture over time. Eventually, they collapsed and d isintegrated as the degradation 
continued [39]. EE of DOXY was not changed signific antly among different PLGA NS 
formulations. The larger diameter of PLGA85-142K NS  was possibly resulted from the 
higher viscosity of the DOXY/PLGA85-142K polymer em ulsion compared to those of 
other polymers (Table 3.2). 
 
In vitro DOXY  release kinetics 
        In vitro  release profiles of DOXY from PLGA NS with four PL GA formulations 
were displayed in Figure 3.2A and release profiles of DOXY from NS-scaffolds were 
shown in Figure 3.2B. Compared to release profiles of DOXY from PLGA NS alone, the 
release from the scaffolds showed a similar release  pattern with decreased initial burst 53 
 release and prolonged release period. In general, t he DOXY release profiles of NS-
scaffolds showed two phases: an initial burst relea se within the first day followed by a 
slow and sustained release over time. There were al so significant differences in both the 
burst release rate and sustained release rate of di fferent PLGA formulations. Both 
PLGA50-6.5K NS-scaffold and PLGA50-64K NS-scaffold released approximately 70% 
of DOXY within the first day and 95% of DOXY within  2 weeks, while the PLGA75-
113K NS-scaffold (with a higher LA/GA ratio and hig her molecular weight) had a lower 
burst release (50%) in the first day and a slower s ustained release of DOXY (85% within 
2 weeks, 95% within 6 weeks). The PLGA85-142K NS-sc affold (with the highest 
LA/GA ratio and the highest molecular weight) had t he lowest burst release (25%) in the 
first day and kept a continuous slow release for lo nger than 6 weeks (80% within 6 
weeks). This two-phase release profile of PLGA nano spheres, characterized by an initial 
burst release followed by a sustained slow release,  indicated that DOXY was dispersed in 
a polymeric matrix inside the PLGA nanospheres [40]  and [41]. The initial burst release 
was reduced with the increase of the PLGA LA/GA rat io and the PLGA molecular 
weight. PLGA85-142K NS-scaffolds with the lowest bu rst release and the longest release 
period was selected for in vitro  antibacterial test. 
 
In vitro antibacterial effect of DOXY  NS-scaffolds 
        The antibacterial activity of the released DOXY was investigated using bacteria 
inhibition experiments. S. aureus  and E. coli  were used in the current study since they 
represent the most common Gram-positive and Gram-ne gative bacteria in the human 54 
 body. The growth of S. aureus  and E. coli  bacteria can be visualized directly from the 
plate to assess the antibacterial function of all s caffold groups (shown in Figure 3.3). It 
was observed that the agar plates with the BSA scaf folds were totally covered with S. 
aureus  or E. coli  after 5 days of incubation. In contrast, the growt h of S. aureus  and E. 
coli  were both inhibited at regions around the DOXY ads orbed scaffolds and DOXY NS-
scaffolds. The bacteria inhibited areas were much l arger on the plates with the DOXY 
NS-scaffolds than DOXY adsorbed scaffolds. 
        The data from the long-term liquid bacteria l culture ( S. aureus  data shown in Figure 
3.4 and E. coli data shown in Figure 3.5) demonstra ted that the antibacterial activity of 
DOXY lasted for more than 6 weeks in the NS control led release group (showed 70% 
inhibition for S. aureus  and 40% inhibition for E. coli  at Day 42), while that of the 
adsorbed DOXY decreased rapidly after 14 days (show ed 18% inhibition for S. aureus  
and 9% inhibition for E. coli  at Day 42) and the BSA scaffold had no antibacteri al effect 
even from the very beginning (showed less than 20% inhibition for S. aureus  and less 
than 10% inhibition for E. coli ). The antibacterial activity of the scaffold measu red over 
time was the measurement of the overall antibacteri al capacity of the scaffold, including 
the reduced DOXY amount released at a later time an d possibly also some biological 
activity loss over time. These results indicated th at the encapsulation of DOXY in the 
nanospheres not only can control the DOXY release r ate and prolong its release duration 
but also retain its antibacterial activity. 55 
 Discussion  
        The main objectives of this work were to fa bricate the DOXY loaded NS with good 
encapsulation efficiency, to incorporate the NS ont o a nano-fibrous scaffold, to release 
DOXY in a controlled manner, and to retain the anti bacterial activity. In previous 
publications from our lab, novel nano-fibrous scaff olds capable of delivering growth 
factors were successfully developed [31] and [32]. While water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) 
double emulsion method can be readily used to entra p proteins into nanospheres, it is 
difficult to entrap very hydrophilic small molecule s such as doxycycline into NS with an 
acceptable encapsulation efficiency (less than 5% s howed in Table 3.3) since the high 
solubility of the drug in the external phase and it s small size makes it easy for the 
majority of the drug to diffuse to the external pha se during the emulsion and solvent 
evaporation process and results in very low encapsu lation efficiency [41]. Some 
researchers made modifications to w/o/w method [22]  or used other encapsulation 
method [20] to achieve a higher DOXY encapsulation efficiency. However, the EE 
increase was limited and the size of the spheres ob tained became much larger, usually in 
the range of 100 Âµm [22]. The DOXY loaded spheres with this size may be used alone for 
antibacterial treatment, but they are too large to be incorporated into the nano-fibrous 
scaffolds [33]. To overcome these limitations, a mo dified w/o/o emulsion and solvent 
evaporation method was successfully adopted to enca psulate DOXY into spheres. By 
changing the external continuous phase from water t o an organic solvent mixture, the 
diffusion of the drug was reduced due to the decrea sed solubility of the drug in the 
external phase, and the encapsulation efficiency wa s greatly improved. It was also 
discovered that the release profile of DOXY from th e PLGA NS-scaffolds was mainly 56 
 determined by the release from NS which can be adju sted by tailoring the chemical 
composition and molecular weight of the PLGA copoly mers. The PLGA85 NS-scaffolds 
with the highest molecular weight and highest LA/GA  had the lowest initial burst release 
(25%) and longest release duration of DOXY (longer than 6 weeks). This trend is 
consistent with our lab's previous publications on the release profiles of growth factors 
from NS-scaffolds [31] and [32]. The difference in release profiles of PLGA NS-scaffold 
was possibly resulted from both the difference in t he NS diameter and PLGA degradation 
rate. PLGA85-142K NS with the largest NS diameter h ad the smallest specific surface 
area and the longest average travel distance for th e encapsulated DOXY to diffuse out of 
the spheres, resulting in the lowest burst release during the earlier release stage. It is also 
possible that the highest viscosity of PLGA85 polym er solution also reduced the 
diffusion of DOXY to the outer oil phase during the  emulsion and solvent evaporation 
process so that the least amount of the drug was si mply absorbed on or near the NS 
surface, resulting in a reduced initial burst relea se. PLGA85-142K NS also had the 
slowest degradation rate due to the highest molecul ar weight and LA/GA ratio, which 
contributed to the slower release rate of DOXY. It was also discovered that incorporating 
DOXY loaded PLGA NS into PLLA nano-fibrous scaffold  effectively reduced burst 
release and slowed down the DOXY release rate. The reduced burst release of DOXY 
from nano-fibrous scaffold may have resulted from t he adsorption and desorption of 
DOXY on the nanofibers before diffusing out of the scaffolds due to the very high 
surface area (100 m 2/g) of the nano-fibrous scaffolds. 
        The antimicrobial experiment demonstrated t he biological function of the DOXY 
released from PLGA NS-scaffolds for a long duration  (6 weeks), which is a great 57 
 improvement for the long-term treatment of dental, periodontal and bone infection or 
MMP-inhibition since the commercially available DOX Y releasing gels typically release 
all DOXY within 2 weeks [42]. These novel DOXY NS-i ncorporated nano-fibrous 
scaffolds were intended for tissue engineering appl ications where microbial infection 
may be involved. While the macro-porous and nano-fi brous scaffolds may promote the 
tissue regeneration, the DOXY NS in the scaffolds m ay also protect the tissue from 
microbial invasion. Since DOXY is also an inhibitor  of multiple MMPs such as MMP-8, 
-9 and -13, DOXY NS-scaffold may also be able to pr otect engineered bone from MMP 
destruction in situations with chronic inflammation  in diseases such as periodontitis and 
rheumatoid arthristis [43]. 
        The 3-D NS-scaffolds developed in this work  have shown the capability of 
controlled delivery of DOXY and inhibition of bacte rial growth for a prolonged period. 
This success has demonstrated the scaffolds to be c apable of controlled delivering small 
hydrophilic drug molecules as well as large protein s. With the versatile delivery 
capability and macro-porous and nano-fibrous struct ure, the scaffolds may allow for the 
implementation of more comprehensive strategies in tissue engineering. 
Conclusion 
        Results of in vitro  release and antibacterial experiments suggest that  the developed 
drug-containing nano-fibrous scaffolds are capable of effectively delivering doxycycline 
in a controlled fashion with prolonged duration. Th ese biodegradable PLLA scaffolds 
have well interconnected macro-porous and nano-fibr ous structure and can inhibit 
common bacterial growth for more than 6 weeks with the incorporation of DOXY 58 
 containing PLGA NS. Release kinetics from the scaff olds was found to be determined by 
PLGA formulation. The incorporation of the NS into scaffolds reduced the burst release. 
PLGA85-142K NS-scaffold has the lowest initial burs t release and the longest release 
period compared to other formulations investigated.  Taken together with earlier studies, 
the NS-scaffold system can be used as a delivery sy stem for both large proteins and small 
drug molecules for various complex tissue engineeri ng applications.

Nano-fibrous scaffold for controlled release of Rec ombinant human basic fibroblast 
growth factor 
 
Introduction 
      To address the conflict between the increasin g need for tissue and organ 
transplantation and the donor tissue shortage, tiss ue engineering has been rapidly 
developing. One of the most common approaches in ti ssue engineering is to seed 
functional cells of interest into three dimensional  (3-D) polymeric scaffolds and then 
either culture the tissue constructs in vitro or im plant them [1, 2]. One major factor of 
determining the success of many implanted tissue co nstructs is whether they can 
vascularize rapidly. A lack of blood flow within a tissue may cause ischemia or delayed 
wound healing. [3-5] Inadequate vascularization hin ders the regeneration of a variety of 
tissues and decreases the long term survival rate o f these tissue implants, because 
sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients is vital for cellsâ growth and function. However, 
native angiogenic process triggered by foreign body  response to implantation is too slow 
or limited to support mass transport for cells in m ost thick tissue or cell/scaffold 
constructs. [6-8] Therefore, it is advantageous to incorporate angiogenic strategy in a 
tissue engeineering approach to stimulate rapid blo od vessel formation of high local 72 
 density.  
      Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a 18-KDa hep arin-binding protein, is 
capable of enhancing the proliferation of fibroblas ts, smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes 
and endothelial cells.[9-12] bFGF is one of the ang iogenic growth factors that have been 
used to stimulate angiogenesis for tissue regenerat ion in animal studies and clinical trials. 
[13-16] However, injected bFGF in a solution form l oses its biological function rapidly 
due to its diffusion away from the application site  and degradation in vivo, [17] high or 
repeated doses are usually needed to maintain suffi cient therapeutic concentration. To 
avoid such growth factor waste and inconvenient adm inistration mode, a localized 
delivery system to release bFGF in a controlled fas hion is highly desired. While simple 
adsorption of growth factors onto a scaffold may he lp local delivery to certain degree, the 
loading efficiency is low and the release is not in  a controlled way. [18] Several other 
attempts have been made to specifically incorporate  bFGF into scaffolds such as gelatin 
hydrogels, alginate beads, collagen sponges, [19-22 ] but they suffered the drawback of 
short release duration (less than a week). We take a new approach to immobilize 
bFGF-encapsulated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)  nanospheres onto the pore walls 
of scaffolds to achieve controlled release. By vary ing the protein loading amount, LA/GA 
ratio of PLGA copolymer, and the PLGA molecular wei ght, the release rate and initial 
burst release of the growth factors can be modulate d primarily by the PLGA nanospheres. 
[23, 24] Several growth factors' bioactivity has be en well preserved by incorporating 
them in biodegradable microspheres when appropriate  formulations are used. [25-27]  73 
       Previously, our laboratory successfully fabricated macro-porous nano-fibrous 
PLLA scaffolds with good mechanical properties, [28 , 29] which successfully enhanced 
cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation  due to its nano-fibrous structure similar 
to that of collagen[30-33]. We have also successful ly encapsulated a few growth factors 
into microspheres or nanospheres and incorporated t hese spheres into scaffolds to 
achieve controlled release. [27, 34, 35] However, i nvestigation on the effects of growth 
factor release profile and dosage on its in vivo fu nction has not been performed before. In 
this work, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) co ntaining PLGA nanospheres were 
immobilized onto a PLLA nano-fibrous scaffold. The morphology of the scaffolds and 
bFGF-containing PLGA nanospheres was observed. The release profiles of the 
nanospheres, nanosphere incorporated scaffolds, bio activity of released bFGF, in vivo 
angiogenesis were examined. The effects of bFGF rel ease rate and bFGF incorporation 
dosage on in vivo cell penetration and vascularizat ion were also investigated.  
 
Materials and methods 
Materials 
      bFGF was kindly provided by Shenandoah Biotec hnology Inc (Warwick, PA) and 
Akron Biotechnology, LLC (Boca Raton, FL). Radio la beled bFGF (125I-bFGF) was 
purchased from PerkinElmer Life And Analytical Scie nces, Inc (Waltham, MA). Bovine 
serum albumin (BSA, Fraction V), sodium heparin (Mw  12,000 KDa) D-fructose, 
mineral oil, and sorbitanmonooleate (span 80) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 74 
 Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO). PLGA copolymers w ith LA/GA ratio of 50:50 
(Lakeshore BiomaterialsTM, PLGA 50-6.5K, Mw=6.5kDa;  PLGA 50-64K, Mw=64KDa) 
and 75:25 (Lakeshore BiomaterialsTM, PLGA 75-113K, Mw=113 kDa) were purchased 
from SurModics Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Birmingham, AL ). Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) 
with inherent viscosity of 1.6 dl/g was purchased f rom Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, 
Germany). Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PV A) (88 mol% hydro lyzed, Mw= 25,000 KDa) was 
obtained from Polysciences Inc. (Warrington, PA). D ichloromethane (DCM), 
cyclohexane, hexane and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were purchased from Fisher Scientific 
(Pittsburgh, PA).  
 
Preparation of PLGA NS and NS incorporated nano-fib rous scaffold (NS-scaffold) 
      bFGF powder was dissolved in 10 mM PBS with t he same amount of heparin as 
bFGF and 50 folds of BSA to form a clear aqueous so lution. PLGA nanospheres were 
fabricated to incorporate bFGF (50Âµg/100mg polymer)  using an established double 
emulsion technique as described previously.  [27, 3 4, 35] Three PLGA formulations: 
PLGA50-6.5K, PLGA50-64K and PLGA75-113K were used f or in vitro  release study 
and radio-labeled 125 I-bFGF was added as a tracer ( 125 I-bFGF: unlabeled bFGF= 1:100). 
bFGF (200Âµg/100mg polymer) were incorporated into P LGA50-64K NS for in vivo  study. 
Blank NS containing only heparin and BSA were prepa red as the control. Macro-porous 
nano-fibrous PLLA scaffolds were prepared by a comb ination of phase separation and 75 
 sugar leaching techniques as described previously. [29] These disc-shaped scaffolds were 
7.2 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness.  
      PLGA50-64K NS was incorporated onto PLLA scaffolds using a post seeding 
method. Briefly, PLGA NS was dispersed in hexane an d seeded onto NS-scaffolds drop 
wise. Then the scaffolds were subjected to a vapor of a mixed solvent of hexane/THF 
(volume ratio 9:1). The scaffolds were vacuum-dried  for 3 days to remove the solvent. 
The morphology of the nanospheres and the scaffolds  before and after nanospheres 
incorporation was examined using scanning electron microscopy (Philips XL30 FEG

      In vitro bFGF release profiles from both PLGA NS an d PLGA NS incorporated 
PLLA scaffolds were determined by radioactivity det ection as follows: One NS-scaffold 
or 10 mg nanospheres were suspended in 1.0 ml phosp hate buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM, 
pH=7.4, with 0.1% BSA) at 37 â with orbital shaking at 60 rpm. At the designated time 
points: 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56 and 63 days, supernatant was collected and 
replaced with an equal amount of fresh medium. The radioactivity of collected 
supernatant was analyzed by a gamma counter (Gamma 5500, Beckman) and the released 
bFGF amount was calculated. BSA/heparin containing NS and NS-scaffolds were used as 
controls.

 Subcutaneous implantation 
      For implantation, male C57BL/6 mice with an age ran ge of 6-8 weeks (Charles 
River Laboratories) were used in the study. The ani mal procedures were performed 
according to the protocol approved by the Universit y of Michigan Committee of Use and 
Care of Laboratory Animals. Surgery was performed u nder general inhalation anesthesia 
with isofluorane as previously described [27]. The back of the animals was shaved, 
washed and disinfected with povidoneiodine. Two mid sagittal incisions were made on the 
dorsa and two subcutaneous pockets were created usi ng blunt dissection. One scaffold 
was implanted subcutaneously into each pocket. Afte r placement of the scaffolds, the 
incisions were closed with staples. The scaffolds w ere randomly implanted into mice and 
three scaffolds were implanted for each experiment group (n=3 animals/group). In order 
to investigate the bioactivity of the released bFGF , three groups of scaffolds were 
implanted: controlled empty nanofibrous scaffold gr oup, nanofibrous scaffold group with 
simple absorption of 3Âµg bFGF/scaffold and nanofibr ous scaffold group with 
PLGA50-64K nanospheres containing 3Âµg bFGF/scaffold . At the end of each 
implantation period (4, 7 and 14 days), the mice we re sacrificed and the scaffolds were 
harvested. In order to investigate the effects of b FGF release rate and dosage on bFGF 
biological functions in vivo, seven groups of scaff olds were implanted into mice (n=3 
animals/group).  They are: controlled group, group with PLGA50-6.5K nanospheres 
(3Âµg bFGF/scaffold), group with PLGA50-64K nanosphe res (3Âµg bFG/scaffold), 
nanofibrous scaffold group with PLGA75-113K nanosph eres (3Âµg bFGF/scaffold), group 77 
 with PLGA50-6.5K nanospheres (0.3Âµg bFGF/scaffold),  nanofibrous scaffold group with 
PLGA50-6.4K nanospheres (1.5Âµg bFGF/scaffold) and g roup with PLGA50-6.5K 
nanospheres (6Âµg bFGF/scaffold). The mice were sacr ificed and the scaffolds were 
harvested after 7 days.  
 
Histological examination 
      The harvested grafts were fixed in 10% neutra l buffered formalin, embedded in 
paraffin, and longitudinally cut into 5 mm thick cross sections. Selected sections were 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate the nature of tissue neogenesis. Images of 
these specimens were captured using a Nikon Eclipse  50i Microscope (Nikon, Inc., 
Melville, NY) fitted with a Nikon Digital Sight DS U1 Camera (Nikon, Inc, Melville, NY) 
for analysis using Image Pro PlusTM Software (Media  Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). 
The entire area of the specimen and the area with t issue penetration were measured. The 
remaining slides were used to perform Factor VIII-r elated antigen/von Willebrand factor 
immunohistochemical staining with an anti-human Fac tor VIII-related antigen/von 
Willebrand factor rabbit polyclonal antibody (NeoMa rkers, Fremont, CA)  or a rabbit 
anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (1:50 dilution) (Abc am, Cambridge, MA). The number 
of positive-stained blood vessels within the scaffo lds was measured.

 Results 
Characterization of bFGF nanospheres and NS scaffol ds 
     bFGF was incorporated into PLGA nanospheres us ing a double emulsion 
technique and three different PLGA formulations (PL GA50-6.5K, PLGA50-64K, 
PLGA75-113K) were used. All nanospheres made from d ifferent PLGA formulations 
were in a spherical shapes as shown in Figure 4.1(A ). The nanospheres of all PLGA 
formulations have a high encapsulation efficiency o f bFGF (68-73%), which was 
determined by radioactivity detection. Based on SEM  observation, the average diameter 
of the NS was approximately 500 nm.  
      3-D macro-porous and nano-fibrous PLLA scaffo lds were prepared with a high 
porosity of 98%. SEM observation showed (Figure 4.1 (b-c)) that the scaffold possessed 
multi-level porous architecture. It had spherical m acro-pores of 250-425 Âµm in diameter, 
inter-pore opening of ~ 100 Âµm, and nano-fibers of 5 0-500 nm in diameter within the 
pore wall of the scaffolds. These nano-fibers were similar to type I collagen fibers in size. 
The well interconnected porous structure and the na no-fibrous structure were not only 
important for the cellular activity and tissue pene tration, but also efficient for the 
incorporation of the growth factor containing NS. 
      Figure 4.1(d-e) shows the morphology of scaff olds after PLGA50-64K 
nanosphere incorporation. Both the spherical macro- pore and inter-pore opening 
structures of the scaffolds were well preserved aft er NS incorporation. The nanospheres 
were attached to nano-fibers on the pore walls and distributed throughout the scaffolds. 79 
 In vitro bFGF release kinetics 
      Cumulative release of bFGF from PLGA NS and PLGA NS  incorporated PLLA 
scaffolds was shown in Figure. 4.2 (A) and (B). The  release of bFGF from PLGA NS and 
PLGA NS incorporated scaffolds showed similar patte rn, while NS-scaffold had a lower 
initial burst release. This observation was in acco rdance with our labâs earlier finding on 
BMP-7 release. [27] It was also discovered that rel ease patterns of different PLGA 
formulations were different. bFGF was released from  PLGA 50-6.5K NS and 
PLGA50-64K NS scaffold with a 66% and 56% initial b urst release respectively. After 
two weeks, 87% and 78% of bFGF were released from t hese two scaffolds. bFGF release 
from PLGA50-64K NS and PLGA50-64k NS scaffolds show ed a multi-phasic pattern. 
The NS and NS scaffolds first rapidly release 46% a nd 43% during the first two weeks 
with the burst release of 35% and 26% respectively.  From week 4, there was a second 
rapid release of near 30% bFGF, which was in accord ance with the significant mass loss 
and disintegration of PLGA NS at that time. [27] Th e bFGF release from both 
PLGA75-113K NS and NS scaffolds were slow with low burst release and sustained 
throughout the whole time period. The initial burst  release was decreased significantly 
with an increase in the molecular weight of PLGA an d/or LA/GA ratio in the PLGA 
copolymer. This result shows that by adjusting the chemical and degradation property of 
the PLGA nanosphere, bFGF release pattern can be co ntrolled.  
 
 80 
 Controlled release of bFGF stimulated tissue neogen esis and neovascularization  
  Four days after implantation, tissue in-growth in to the scaffolds was minimal in 
the BSA and bFGF adsorbed groups, while there was m ore tissue in-growth into the 
superficial layers of the scaffolds(1-2 layers) in the bFGF NS scaffold release group (Fig. 
4.3A). At Day 7, penetrating tissue occupied half t he scaffold space in bFGF NS scaffold 
group, while the tissue penetration was seen only i n the superficial regions of the 
scaffolds in the other two groups (Fig. 4.3B). In a ddition, there was more vascularization 
in the bFGF NS scaffold group than the other two gr oups. At 14 days, penetrating tissue 
occupied the entire scaffolds in bFGF NS scaffold g roup. There were still some regions 
without tissue in the bFGF-Adsorbed only scaffold a nd BSA NS scaffold (Fig. 4.3C). 
Parallel to the histological observations, the hist omorphometry measurements of 7 and 14 
days specimens (Fig. 4.4) showed that the tissue pe netration percentage (penetration 
tissue area versus the whole area), was significant ly higher in the bFGF NS release group 
than in the other two groups. Then, the vasculariza tion within scaffolds was investigated 
for the in vivo  effect of released bFGF on blood vessel formation.  Factor VIII-related 
antigen/von Willebrand factor immunohistochemical s taining was used. Fig. 4.5 indicated 
that at 7 days, vascularization inside the scaffold s was greatest in the bFGF NS release 
group, which is in accordance with the results of m easurement of the blood vessel 
number (Fig.4. 6). However, at 3, and 14 days, the blood vessel numbers in the scaffolds 
were not significant different among all groups. 
 81 
  
Release profile and dosage of bFGF influenced tissu e neogenesis and 
neovascularization 
     Seven days after implantation, penetrating tis sue occupied almost the entire 
scaffolds in PLGA50-6.5K NS scaffold group (3.0Âµg b FGF/scaffold), while only 
approximately half of the scaffolds were penetrated  by tissue in-growth in PLGA50-64K 
NS scaffold group (3.0Âµg bFGF/scaffold) and PLGA75- 113K NS scaffold group (3.0Âµg 
bFGF/scaffold). The tissue penetration was seen onl y in the superficial regions of the 
scaffold in control group without bFGF. (Fig. 4.5A)  The histomorphometry 
measurements (Fig. 4.5B) showed that the tissue pen etration percentage was significantly 
higher in PLGA50-6.5K NS scaffold group than in the  PLGA50-64k NS group and 
PLGA75-113K NS group (Fig. 4.5B). These three scaff olds all have significant higher 
cell penetration than control group. In addition, F ig. 4.6A indicated that at 7 days, 
vascularization inside the scaffolds was greatest i n PLGA50-6.5K NS scaffold groups 
which is in accordance with the results of measurem ent of the blood vessel number(Fig. 
4.6B). According to Fig 4.7. and Fig. 4.8, the tiss ue penetration and vascularization inside 
scaffolds increased with the increase of bFGF dosag e and peaked at 3Âµg /scaffold dosage, 
while the same PLGA1A NS were used to incorporate b FGF.  
 
Discussion 
  The present study reports for the first time that  a 3-D nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds 
with incorporated PLGA NS provides a desired contro lled bFGF delivery in vivo and 82 
 enhances tissue neogenesis and angiogenesis. The bi ologic function of bFGF depends on 
its release profile from scaffold. With the increas e of bFGF release rate, the biologic 
function of bFGF is enhanced. It was also discovere d that the biologic function of bFGF 
also depends on bFGF incorporation dosage. It incre ases with the increase of bFGF 
dosage until an optimal dosage is reached and then it decreases.  
  One of the great challenges in tissue engineering  is to provide adequate oxygen 
and nutrients transport to the implants to improve cell penetration and vascular invasion 
to support tissue neogenesis and function. Potent a ngiogenic agents delivered from the 
tissue engineered scaffolds can enhance this vascul arization process. Basic fibroblast 
growth factor, one of the angiogenic agents, has go od angiogenic and mitogenic 
properties so that it has been used to stimulate th e regeneration of blood vessel [13]and 
other organs. [36, 37] A sustained and controlled d rug delivery system is often necessary 
to deliver bioactive bFGF over a prolonged period a t the target site to increase the 
therapeutic efficacy of bFGF since bFGF has a short  half-life (12 hours in vitro and less 
than three minutes in vivo). [38, 39] Various natur al [19, 40-42]and synthetic [43-45] 
polymer delivery systems have been developed for bF GF. The ideal delivery system 
should be able to not only deliver bioactive bFGF i n a controlled way but also provide a 
suitable physical and chemical environment for cell ular activity and tissue formation. 
  Compared to other delivery systems, this new deli very system offers several 
advantages: First, it provides an excellent environ ment for cell penetration and 
neogenesis. In the scaffold, PLLA and PLGA are both  FDA approved biodegradable and 83 
 biocompatible synthetic. The scaffolds offer good m echanical properties, high porosity 
(98%), well interconnected macro-pores and inter-po re openings, and a nano-fibrous 
structure. These structures promotes cell attachmen t, proliferation, differentiation. [30, 32, 
46] Second, bFGF containing PLGA nanospheres were s uccessfully incorporated onto 
nanofibrous scaffolds using a post seeding techniqu e so that the macro and 
microstructures of the scaffolds were well preserve d. Third, bFGF released from NS 
immobilized scaffolds were mainly determined by the  release pattern of PLGA 
nanospheres and the NS release pattern was controll ed by PLGA copolymerâs 
degradation properties. So, it is appropriate to ta ilor the release kinetics of growth factors 
from NS incorporated scaffold by simply choosing or  synthesizing the suitable PLGA 
copolymer for a specific tissue engineering researc h.  
  Due to the interconnected macro-pores and inter-p ore micro openings and the 
nano-fibous structures, after 14 days of implantati on, cells and tissues penetrated into all 
scaffold (control, bFGF Absorbed, bFGF NS incorpora ted) groups (Fig 4.3C). Only 
bFGF NS incorporated scaffolds showed tissue penetr ation into the entire scaffolds. The 
same trend was observed for tissue in-growth at 7 d ays after subcutaneous implantation 
(Fig 4.3B). At day 4, only bFGF NS incorporated sca ffolds showed significant tissue 
in-growth into the superficial layer. Immunohistoch emical staining after 7 days and 
blood vessel number measurement (Fig. 4.4B) also co nfirmed the advantage of NS 
incorporated NS scaffold over the other two groups in terms of its ability to stimulate 
blood vessel formation throughout the scaffolds. Re sults from the 4 th  and 14 th  day 84 
 showed no significant difference between groups. It  is possible that it was too early for 
the released bFGF to be effective in stimulating bl ood vessel at Day 4, while at Day 14, 
native angiogenesis process completes, so no signif icant difference could be observed. 
From these results, it was confirmed that bFGF cont aining NS scaffolds not only protect 
the bioactivity of the protein against denaturation  or degradation, but also release the 
bioactive growth factors in a prolonged and control led way, while bFGF Absorbed 
scaffolds failed to do so.  
  We also explored the effects of release profile a nd dosage of bFGF from scaffolds 
on its in vivo biological functions. It was found a t 7 days, PLGA50-6.5K NS scaffold 
group showed much higher cell penetration percentag e (Fig.4.5) and blood vessel 
formation (Fig. 4.6) than PLGA50-64K and PLGA75-113 K NS scaffold groups, while 
the bFGF dosage of all three scaffolds were kept th e same at 3Âµg/scaffold. 
PLGA50-6.5K NS scaffold with the lowest molecular w eight and lowest LA/GA ratio 
releases bFGF fastest with a 65% of bFGF released w ithin one week compared to 35% 
and 25% of bFGF released from PLGA50-64K and PLGA75 -113K NS scaffold during 
the same time period (Fig 4.2B). The higher amount bFGF released from PLGA50-6.5K 
NS scaffolds stimulated more cell migration into th e scaffolds, more cell proliferation 
and caused more blood vessel formation. It was also  found at 7 days, bFGF biological 
function was enhanced with the increase of bFGF dos age from 0.3 to 3.0Âµg/scaffold, 
while all scaffold groups used PLGA50-6.5K NS to in corporate bFGF. (Fig4.7. and Fig 
4.8.) This effect is also caused by the increased c oncentration of bFGF present inside the 85 
 scaffolds and surrounding the scaffolds. However, w hen the dosage of bFGF was 
increased from 3.0 to 6.0Âµg/scaffold, a decrease in  both cell penetration and blood vessel 
formation was observed. The possible explanation fo r this phenomena is that with the 
excess released bFGF diffused out of the scaffold s timulated cell growth and formed 
much thick connective tissue capsules surrounding s caffolds compared to other groups 
(showed with arrows in Fig. 4.7A). This thick tissu e capsules layer prevented both more 
bFGF diffusion out of the scaffolds to recruit cell s and cell migration into scaffolds and 
resulted in a decrease in cell penetration percenta ge and less blood vessel formation in 7 
day time period.  
  Thus, in order to achieve the goal to improve cel l penetration and vascular 
invasion into the tissue engineering implants to su pport neogenesis and function, not only 
angiogenic factors like bFGF needs to be provided w ith protected bioactivity in a 
prolonged time period, but also they need be provid ed with a suitable rate and dosage to 
achieve optimal effect. If the dosage is too low, n ot enough cells will be recruited and 
migrated into scaffold which will result in less ti ssue penetration and less neo-blood 
vessel formation. On the other hand, if the dosage is applied too high, tissue 
encapsulation will be formed around scaffold to blo ck cell migration which will also 
result in decreased cell penetration and less blood  vessel formation. The PLGA NS 
incorporated nano-fibrous PLLA scaffold descried in  this study with its cell attachment, 
proliferation, differentiation beneficial macro-por ous and nanofibrous 3D structure and 
its easily adjustable controlled release capability  of growth factors offers an excellent 86 
 tool for tissue engineering scientists to achieve t his goal. 
 
Conclusion 
  We have developed bFGF containing NS incorporated  nano-fibrous scaffold, 
which is capable of releasing bioactive bFGF in a l ocalized and temporally controlled 
fashion with prolonged duration. This NS-scaffold s ystem functioned well to improve 
tissue penetration and blood vessel formation due t o both its highly interconnected 
porous structure and its sustained release of bioac tive bFGF. The released bFGF 
functions in vivo in a release rate dependent and d osage dependent fashion. This novel 
PLGA NS nano-fibrous scaffold with its 3D refined c omplex structure and controlled 
bioactive bFGF release capability provides signific ant potential for multiple tissue 
engineering applications.

Dual release of bone morphogenetic protein-7(BMP-7)  and platelet derived growth 
factor (PDGF)   from nano-fibrous PLLA scaffolds for periodontal t issue 
regeneration  
 
Introduction 
        Today, there are more than 50 million adult s suffer from severe periodontitis in US. 
[1] Periodontitis, being the leading cause of tooth  loss, is a common oral inflammatory 
infectious disease that can lead to the destruction  of tooth supporting tissues such as 
alveolar bone, periodontal ligament and cementum.[2 ] Clinical periodontal therapies 
which mainly deal with eliminating inflammation sou rces and halting disease progression 
are not sufficient in complete regeneration of thes e multi-tissue tooth supporting 
structures and restoration of their full biological  functions. [3] Therefore, it will be a great 
clinical impact to be able to restore these soft/ha rd multi tissue structures with dental 
tissue engineering approach. One important strategy  in dental tissue engineering is to 
deliver signaling cues (e.g, growth factors)  [4, 5] Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 
and Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) are two i mportant growth factors for dental 
tissue development. 
               Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) a re important growth factors in bone 
development and regeneration. [6, 7] BMP-2, BMP-4 a nd BMP-7 are the most effective 
ones in inducing bone formation at both orthotopic and ectopic sites among members of 
BMP family.[8-13] BMP-7 has been used in periodonta l regeneration to promote 102 
 osteogensis, cementogenesis and periodontal ligamen t reconstruction. [14-16] However, 
despite BMPs' success in bone regeneration in anima l and preclinical studies, their 
clinical success are limited due to their very high  dosage requirement and the high cost 
and complications associated with it. [17, 18]  Fir st possible solution to this problem 
could be the development of an appropriate BMP deli very system which enables a 
prolonged BMP release duration and protects BMP fro m proteolysis, denaturation and 
bioactivity loss to stimulate bone regeneration. [1 9-21] Second possible solution to this 
problem could be delivery of other growth factors a lone with BMP to introduce 
synergetic effect and lower BMP dosage needed. [22]  Platelet derived growth factor 
(PDGF) belongs to a multifunctional growth factor f amily. PDGF is composed of A, B, C 
and D polypeptide chains to form homo- or heterodim eric molecules. [23] PDGF can 
bind to two structurally related, intrinsic tyrosin e kinase receptors (PDGF-R Î± and PDGF-
RÎ²) [24]to modulate cell migration and proliferation,  prevent cell apoptosis and promote 
extracellular matrix synthesis and vascularization. [24-27] PDGF plays an important role 
in both organ development [26]and tissue repair. [2 8-30] Recombinant PDGF has been 
widely studied as a potential therapeutic agent to enhance periodontal wound repair  [29] 
and regeneration  preclinically [31-33]and clinically.  [34, 35]  PDGF has been approved 
by FDA for enhancing bone repair of periodontal oss eous defects. [29, 36] 
        Our previous researches developed novel PLG A nanospheres immobilized PLLA 
nanofibrous scaffold that could locally release sin gle growth factor in a controlled 
fashion. [37, 38] Sustained release of BMP-7 from t his PLLA scaffold induced 
significant ectopic bone formation [38]while sustai ned release of PDGF promoted 
neogenesis and angiogenesis successfully[39]. One a dvantage of this scaffold release 103 
 system is its ability to deliver multiple growth fa ctors in distinct dosages and release 
rates. Therefore, we hypothesize that localized dua l release of BMP-7 and PDGF from 
PLLA nanofibrous scaffold in a controlled fashion c an significantly improve bone 
formation.  In the present study, we investigate th e synergetic effect of controlled dual 
release of BMP-7 and PDGF from the novel PLLA nano- fibrous scaffolds in both mouse 
ectopic bone formation model and rat periodontal fe nestration defect repair model. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Materials 
        RhBMP-7 and rhPDGF were kindly provided by Stryker Biotech (Hopkinton, MA) 
and Biomimetic Therapeutics (Franklin, TN) respecti vely. PLGA copolymers with 
LA/GA ratio of 50:50 (Lakeshore Biomaterialsâ¢, PLGA 50-6.5K, Mw = 6.5 kDa; 
PLGA50-64K, Mw = 64KDa) were purchased from SurModi cs Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
(Birmingham, AL). Poly( L-lactic acid) (PLLA) with inherent viscosity of 1.6  dl/g was 
purchased from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Ger many). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) 
(88 mol% hydrolyzed, M W = 25,000) were obtained from Polysciences Inc. 
Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), Bovine serum albumin (B SA, Fraction V) and gelatin (type B 
from bovine skin) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St Louis MO). Dichloromethane 
(DCM), cyclohexane, hexane, tetrahydrofuran (THF) w ere purchased from Fisher 
Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). 
 
Preparation of nanosphere-immobilized nano-fibrous scaffolds (NS-NFS) 
        Nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds were fabricated  as prev iously described. The scaffolds 
have high porosity of 98%.  They have macropores 25 0-425 Âµm in diameter and an 104 
 average interpore opening size of 116 Âµm. [40] For mouse subcutaneous implantation, 
highly porous scaffold were cut into circular disks  with dimensions of 3.6 mm in 
diameter and 2 mm in thickness. For rat periodontal  fenestration defect implantation, 
scaffolds were cut into rectangular cylinder with d imensions of 
3mm(L)Ã3mm(W)Ã2mm(H).  
        rhBMP-7 was incorporated into PLGA50-6.5K N S and rhPDGF was encapsulated 
into PLGA50-64K NS respectively using a double emul ation techniques as previously 
described. [37, 38] PLGA NS were incorporated nanof ibrous PLLA scaffolds using a 
post-seeding method. [37, 38] The growth factor amo unt in a scaffold was determined by 
the concentration of growth factor encapsulated in the PLGA NS and the amount of NS 
immobilized onto scaffold. NS containing gelatin/BS A was also incorporated into 
scaffolds and used as a control. After the post-see ding, the NS were further immobilized 
onto the scaffold wall by exposing the scaffold to a mixed vapor of hexane/THF (volume 
ratio 9/1) followed by vacuum drying for 3 days. Th e morphology of the scaffolds before 
and after the dual growth factors immobilization wa s observed using scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM, Philips SL30 FEG). 
 
Preparation of implants 
        For the mouse subcutaneous implantation study, 18 g roups of scaffold implants 
(total 216 scaffold implants) were prepared as list ed in table 5.1. Three BMP-7 dosages 
chosen for subcutaneous study were 0, 0.5 and 1.5 Âµ g/scaffold, while the PDGF dosages 
were varied from 5 times to one fifth of each corre sponding BMP-7 dosage. For rat 
periodontal fenestration defect implantation, four groups of scaffold implants (total 26 105 
 scaffold implants)  were prepared as listed in table 5.2. The BMP-7 dos age was 1.5 
Âµg/scaffold, and the PDGF was kept at 3 Âµg/scaffold ,   BMP/PDGF ratio was kept at 1:2. 
 
Mouse subcutaneous implantation  
        All animal procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on 
Use and Care of Animals. For surgical procedures, g eneral anesthesia was administered 
to six-week old, male C57/BL6 mice (Harlan Laborato ries, Indianapolis, IN) by 
isoflurane inhalation. The backs of the animals wer e shaved and disinfected with a 10% 
povidone-iodine solution. Two midsagittal incisions  (approx. 1 cm) were made on the 
dorsa of each mouse and two subcutaneous pockets we re created using blunt forceps on 
each side of the incision, allowing four scaffolds to be implanted in each mouse. The NF-
scaffolds were carefully implanted into each pocket  and the incisions were closed with 
surgical staples. At the end of each implantation p eriod (3 or 6 weeks), the mice were 
euthanized by carbon dioxide overdose and the scaff olds were harvested for analysis.  
 
Rat periodontal fenestration defect implantation 
        General anesthesia was performed on rat wit h ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 
mg/kg). Ophthalmic ointment was applied to prevent irritation and reduce eye dryness 
during surgery. After reflecting the skin and the m uscle by incision, full thickness 
mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated around the mandi bular 1st molar. One periodontal 
fenestration defect was created on the buccal side of the mandible in each rat. The 
standard fenestration defect (3 Ã 2 mm 2 dimension) exposed the distal root surface of the 
1st molar tooth. The cementum layer on the exposed root surface was removed and the 106 
 dentin surface was exposed. Each scaffold was impla nted into the fenestration defect. The 
muscle and skin incisions were sutured and closed w ith surgical staples, respectively. 
Caprofen (5 mg/kg) was administrated subcutaneously  as analgesic approximately 1 hour 
post-surgery. To maintain energy and prevent infect ion, animals were given a 5% 
dextrose solution in water containing 268 g/L ampic illin for one week post-surgery. 5 
weeks later, animals were euthanized with CO 2 and biopsies were collected and fixed 
with 10% phosphate-buffered neutral formalin. All a nimal surgeries were performed 
under a protocol approved by the University Committ ee on Use and Care of Animals at 
the University of Michigan. 
 
Micro-computed tomography volumetric measurements 
        Both mouse subcutaneous implantation and ra t periodontal fenestration defect 
implantation scaffold samples were subject to micro -computed tomography (micro-CT) 
Volumetric Measurements. Non-decalcified subcutaneo us implant and mandible 
specimens were scanned at a resolution of 18x18x18 Âµm 3 voxels using a ÂµCT 100 cabinet 
cone-beam micro-CT system (Scanco USA, Inc, Wayne, PA).  GEHC MicroView 
Analysis+ 2.1.2Â® software (GE Healthcare, Little Ch anlfont, UK) was used to create 
three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of harvested  specimens as previously described 
[41]. Specimen scans were then oriented into standa rdized position. For subcutaneous 
implant specimens, the region of interest (ROI) for  analysis of mineralized tissue 
formation encompassed the entire specimen.  The ROI  for analysis of mineralized tissue 
formation in mandible specimens was created using t he horizontal length of entire defect 
and vertical length of the recessed surface along t he exposed distal root of the first molar 107 
 [42].  To distinguish between mineralized and non-m ineralized voxels, the threshold 
gray-scale value for each subcutaneous implant spec imen was determined by one masked 
and calibrated examiner, while the other masked and  calibrated examiner determined the 
threshold value for each of the mandible specimens.  The average threshold gray-scale 
value was calculated and used as the representative  value to derive the following 
parameters: tissue mineral content (TMC, mg), and t issue mineral density (TMD, mg/cm 3) 
for implant and mandible specimens. Bone volume fra ction represents the ratio between 
the bone volume and total ROI volume. TMC represent s the amount of calcified tissue 
present, while TMD is a measure of bone quality â r epresented by the formula TMC/BV.   
 
Calcium content measurement 
        Mouse subcutaneous implantation samples wer e subject to calcium content 
measurement. After MicroCT scanning of non-decalcif ied subcutaneous implant, the 
implants were rinsed with MilliQ water, lyophilized , dissolved with 10 ml HClO. One 
microlitter of the resulting solution was added to 5 ml mix solution of calcium buffer 
reagent and calcium color reagent in the calcium me asure kit (Pointe Scientific, Inc. 
Canton, MI). The solution was incubated at room tem perature for 5 minutes, and read at 
650 nm in UV spectrophotometer. Five mg/ml of calci um chloride solution was used as a 
standard.  
 
Histological examination 
        Both mosue subcutaneous implantation and Ra t periodontal fenestration defect 
implantation scaffold samples were subject to histo logical examination. For mice 108 
 subcutaneous study, after 3 and 6 weeks, scaffolds implants were harvested.  They were 
fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin and then emb edded in paraffin. Five-micrometer 
sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for light microscopic 
observation. [15, 43] 
        For rat periodontal fenestration defect imp lantation study, regenerated tissue on 
scaffolds was harvest 2 and 5 weeks after surgery a nd were then placed into Bouinâs 
fixative, decalcified with 10% vol/vol acetic acid,  4% vol/vol formaldehyde, 0.85% NaCl 
for 2 to 3 weeks and then embedded in paraffin. The  specimens were cut into 4 to 5 Âµm 
coronal sections and stained with hematoxylin and e osin (H & E) or toluidine blue for 
visualization by light microscopy. 
        Periodontal tissue repair and regeneration was determined using computer-assisted 
image analysis. Images of specimens were captured a t 2, 4, 10, and 20x magnification 
using a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope (Nikon Inc., M elville, NY) fitted with a Nikon 
Digital Sight DS U1 camera (Nikon Inc., Melville, N Y). Histomorphometric analysis was 
performed using NIS Elements Basic Research Imaging  software (Nikon Inc., Melville, 
NY).  A single masked, calibrated examiner examined  all of the slides. The parameters of 
periodontal regeneration measured included: 1) leng th of new cementum on the distal 
root of the first molar in mm (measured at 5-week t ime point only); 2) length of new 
bridging bone measured from the borders of the orig inal osseous defect (mesially-distally) 
in mm (2 and 5 week time points); 3) area of new bo ne associated with the osseous defect 
and nanofibrous scaffold in mm 2 (2 and 5 week time points). Mean values were gener ated 
for each of the groups and significant differences were determined using an analysis of 
variance. 109 
 Results 
Characterization of dual BMP-7/PDGF nanosphere-immo bilized scaffold 
        Fig 5.1 shows that the 3D multi-level porou s architecture of PLLA scaffold after 
BMP and PDGF containing nanosphere incorporation.  Regular spherical macropores 
(250-425 Âµm in diameter) and interpore openings (ap proximately 100 Âµm in diameter) 
remained open and unaltered. After NS incorporation , the nanofibers (50-500 nm in 
diameter) on the scaffold wall were adhered with PL GA MS/NS. PLGA MS/NS were 
uniformly distributed throughout the scaffolds. In vitro release studies of single BMP-7  
[38] or PDGF  [37] from PLLA nanofibrous scaffold were performed and the results were 
published in previous papers. Briefly, the release profiles of single protein from 
nanospheres in scaffold was determined by PLGA form ulation. 48% of BMP-7 was 
released from PLGA50-6.5K NS scaffold in initial fi rst day burst release and 78% of 
BMP-7 released within the first two weeks. [38] PLG A50-64K NS scaffold released 
PDGF in a multi-phasic pattern.  23% of PDGF were r eleased in initial first day burst 
release and 40% released within two weeks, followed  by a 3 weeks slow release (0.3% 
per day). From week 5 to 8, there is another fast r elease of 20% which corresponds to 
PLGA NS degradation. [37, 38]  
 
Mouse subcutaneous implantation results 
        Three weeks after subcutaneous implantation, Fig 5. 2 A and B showed that the 
highest calcium content and highest Micro-CT tissue  mineral content were found in the 
BMP-7 (1.5 Âµg/scaffold) +PDGF (3 Âµg/scaffold), BMP- 7/PDGF 1:2 group (group 17). It 
was noted that both the calcium content and tissue mineral content were much lower in 110 
 BMP-7 (1.5 Âµg/scaffold) single release group (group  3), even though group 17 and group 
3 had the same BMP dosage. It was also observed tha t these two values were lower in 
group 14, 15, 16, 18, even though they shared the s ame dosage of BMP-7 with group 17 
but with different BMP/PDGF ratio. In consistence w ith calcium content and micro-CT 
measurement, Fig 5.3 of microscopic observations of  the H&E stained tissue sections of 
scaffolds harvested 3 weeks after subcutaneous impl antation showed robust neo bone 
formation (stained pink ) in scaffold group 17.  Al though tissues have penetrated all the 
scaffold groups (1-18), no bone formation was found  in control groups (group 1) and 
PDGF single release groups (4, 5, 6, 7, 8) While an y groups with BMP-7 release showed 
some neo-bone formation, group 17 with BMP-7 (1.5 Âµ g/scaffold) +PDGF (3 
Âµg/scaffold), BMP-7/PDGF 1:2 ratio showed highest a mount neo-bone formation.  After 
six weeks of subcutaneous implantation, Fig 5.4 of microscopic observations showed 
there is still no bone formation found in control g roup (1) or low dosage PDGF single 
release group (4-7). Cells presented in those scaff olds are mainly fibroblasts and 
macrophages. High dosage PDGF single release group (8) showed some neo-bone 
formation but the amount is smaller compared to any  BMP-7/PDGF dual release group. 
Group 17 showed significant neo-bone formation and was one of the best groups in terms 
of calcium content and micro-CT tissue mineral cont ent. (Fig 5.2 A and B) These results 
suggest that release of BMP-7 from PLLA nanofibrous  scaffolds with proper controlled 
delivery system induces ectopic bone formation. The  release of PDGF from the scaffold 
significantly enhances BMP induced ectopic bone for mation. The best synergetic ectopic 
bone forming effect of the dual release of these tw o growth factors occurred in scaffold 
group 17 with BMP-7 (1.5 Âµg/scaffold) +PDGF (3 Âµg/s caffold), BMP-7/PDGF 1:2. This 111 
 dosage combination was used as the optimal dosage c ombination for rat periodontal 
fenestration defect repair study. 
      
Rat periodontal fenestration defect repair results 
Histology examination 
        Fig 5.5 of microscopic observations of the H&E stained tissue sections of scaffolds 
harvested 2 weeks implantation showed minimal bridg ing and no neo cementum 
formation in all scaffolds groups, which was normal  for such an early time point. 
However, bone formation lateral to the defect (indi cated by open arrow) was observed in 
BMP single release groups (e) as small and scatteri ng distributed bone tissues that were 
stained pink.  BMP-7/PDGF dual-release groups (g) s howed much more larger and 
complete pink bone tissue structures, which indicat ed most extensively neo bone 
formation.  Fig 5.6 showed a close look at these sc affolds at defect regions and lateral 
defect border at higher magnifications. It was also  observed that the dual release group 
induced higher bone formation (with largest integra ted pink bone areas) and more blood 
vessel formation (with larger number of red vessel structure). Consistent to histological 
observation, histomorphometric analysis at 2 weeks (Fig 5.7) confirmed that BMP-
7/PDGF dual release scaffold groups resulted in sig nificant increase in new bone area 
above control and PDGF single-release groups, and l arger bone area than BMP-7 single 
release group, although the difference was not sign ificant at this time point.  
        Fig 5.8 of microscopic observations of the H&E stai ned tissue sections of scaffolds 
harvested 5 weeks implantation showed that bridging  and bone formation was observed 
in all scaffold groups, with pink bone tissue areas  observed in all experiment groups. 112 
 However, the dual release group (g) formed integrat ed neo-bone structure to occupy the 
whole defect region and the bone bridging in this g roup is continuous while the bone 
bridging in all the other groups was disrupted and the bone structures are incomplete. 
New cementum formation was also observed in all gro ups at this time point. Fig 5.6 
showed a close look at these scaffolds at defect re gions and lateral defect border at higher 
magnifications. It was confirmed that dual release group forms complete large bone to 
cover the whole defect area, while neo-formed bone tissues were discontinuous and 
scattered inside the defect in other groups. Dual r elease group also showed most obvious 
blood vessel formations. In accordance to histology  micrograph observation, 
Histomorphometric analysis at 5 weeks (Fig 5.10) co nfirmed that BMP-7/PDGF dual 
release scaffold groups resulted in significant imp rovements in new bone area above all 
the other groups at this time point. 
 
Quantitative and qualitative micro-CT analysis 
        In sectional views of micro-CT images, (Fig. 5.11),  sagittal views of the 
representative three-dimensional (3-D) micro-CT iso surface images demonstrated the 
differences in mineralized tissue healing and bone regeneration between the experimental 
groups. While distal root was still exposed in cont rol scaffold only group, PDGF and 
BMP single release groups, it was not exposed anymo re and covered by regenerated bone 
in BMP-7/PDGF dual release group after 5 weeks defe ct repair. The dual BMP-7/PDGF 
release group presented larger amounts of tooth sup porting mineralized tissue inside of 
the marked ROIs in both transverse and coronal sect ions compared to the control group 
and BMP-7, PDGF single release group. Although peri odontal osseous defects with 113 
 standardized dimensions were created, mineralized t issue formation was not limited to 
the defect site and was sometimes present along the  native bone (denoted by white 
dashed lines) on the buccal side of the mandible. I t was obvious that dual release group 
had most bone formation extended beyond the bony en velope. 
        In accordance to the micro-CT sectional vie w images, qualitative analysis (Fig 5.12 
A) confirmed that dual release scaffold groups indu ced significant higher amount of 
mineralized tissue formation in the total defect ar ea of all the experiment groups. These 
tissue mineral content includes both tooth supporti ng tissue and non-tooth supporting 
tissues. Overall, none of the experimental groups d emonstrated statistically significant 
differences in tissue mineral density at 5 weeks.  
 
Discussion 
        The major goal of periodontal tissue engineering is  to reconstruct tooth supporting 
multi-tissue structures destroyed by either injury or severe chronic periodontitis. One 
important strategy is to deliver growth factor to p eriodontal lesions to achieve periodontal 
tissue repair. Although success has been achieved b y deliver of single growth factor to 
periodontal lesions to stimulate partial periodonta l tissue regeneration, [14, 32, 44] their 
clinical utility was limited. One major reason is t hat periodontal tissue regeneration, for 
example periodontal bone regeneration is a multi-st ep process that requires the 
stimulation from multiple biological factors includ ing (inflammatory, angiogenetic and 
osteogenetic) in a dynamic and coordinated manner. So, the periodontal bone 
regeneration relied on single delivery of BMP-7 is not sufficient for clinical applications.  
Thus, in order to significantly to improve bone for mation, multiple growth factors 114 
 delivery in distinct dosage and rate to mimic natur al regeneration process is absolutely 
needed. PDGF was found to stimulate periodontal wou nd repair [29] and enhance bone 
regeneration of periodontal osseous defects. [29, 3 6] In addition, our previous research 
demonstrated that controlled delivery of PDGF stimu lates neogenesis and angiogenesis, 
[37, 39] which usually couples with bone regenerati on. [45] Therefore, angiogenesis 
factor such as PDGF could be applied along with BMP  in periodontal tissue regeneration 
to improve BMP induced bone repair. Early angiogene sis can be improved by the release 
of PDGF, thus, more nutrients, growth factors and o xygen are transported to the defect 
site by larger number of newly-formed blood vessels , which favors neo bone formation.  
Invasion of blood vessel is also desirable in carti lage to bone transformation during 
endochondral ossification process since they transp ort both stem cells and osteo-
progenitors.  [46] These cells deposit bone on cartilage matrix a t the later stage of 
endochondral ossification which favors more bone fo rmation as a final outcome. 
        However, this promising strategy has not ac hieved significant clinical success yet 
mostly due to the lack of localized controlled deli very system which can release multiple 
growth factors with distinct dosages and rates, sin ce the synergistic effect of angiogenetic 
factor with BMP to promote bone regeneration can on ly be achieved when a defined 
suitable release dosage and kinetics are applied. [ 47-50] 
        Previously, a nanofibrous tissue engineerin g scaffold has been developed in our lab 
which can serve as both a growth factor delivery ve hicle and a 3-dimensional cellular 
construct for multiple tissue regeneration. [37, 38 , 40, 51] Both BMP-7 and PDGF have 
successfully been delivered from this nanofibrous s caffold with controllable release 
dosage and kinetics and these released growth facto rs have successfully exerted their 115 
 biological functions in vivo. [38, 39] The capabili ty to deliver multiple growth factors 
with distinct release dosages and kinetics is one o f the advantage of this type of scaffold. 
Our data has shown that ectopic bone formation was increased by the dual release of 
PDGF along with BMP-7 from this scaffold system and  the improvement depended on 
the ratio of the two growth factors. The most impro vement came with the combination of 
BMP-7 (1.5 Âµg/scaffold), PDGF (3.0 Âµg/scaffold), BM P-7/PDGF ratio 1:2. (Fig 5.2-5.4). 
Our data also showed that using this dual release s caffold with BMP-7/PDGF 1:2 ratio in 
rat  periodontal fenestration defect repair model, impro ved periodontal repair was 
observed with this dual release group compared to t he control and single BMP-7 and 
PDGF release groups. In dual release group, more mi neralized tissues were regenerated 
to fill more spaces in the total defect region (Fig  5.7 and Fig. 5.10) and the distal root was 
no longer exposed, while in other groups, part of r oot was still exposed. (Fig 5.11). The 
bridging along the defect in dual release group was  much more continuous than in other 
groups. (Fig 5.8).  
        Our data suggested that early angiogenesis was improved by the release of PDGF in 
dual release group, with more new blood vessels for med. (Fig 5.6). These new formed 
blood vessels transported more growth factors, nutr ients and oxygen to the defect site to 
promote neogenesis. It was also observed more blood  vessels were presented close to 
newly formed bone areas in dual release scaffold gr oups, (Fig. 5.10) which proved that  
the invasion of blood vessels also promoted bone ma rrow cells invasion and deposition of 
bone matrix on cartilage matrix during later stage of endochondral ossification. All these 
effects were combined together and resulted in stro nger bone formation in dual release 
group.         116 
         Besides, It was also noted that when the du al release scaffold system was applied in 
periodontal defect repair, mineralized tissue forma tion was not limited to the defect site 
which demonstrated the potential of this scaffold t o be used in much larger sized osseous 
defect repair applications.  
 
Conclusion 
        We have developed a novel PLLA nanofibrous scaffold  which can fulfill localized 
dual release of BMP-7 and PDGF in a controlled fash ion with distinct dosage and release 
kinetics. Both ectopic bone formation and periodont al fenestration defect regeneration 
was significantly improved with this dual release s caffold system. The improvement was 
dependent on the dosage and the release kinetics of  the two growth factors. This 
nanofibrous scaffold with its controlled multiple g rowth factor delivery capacity can be 
applied in various tissue regeneration and large si zed defect repair.

Fabrication of an anisotropic bilayered composite s caffold to induce zonal 
development of cartilage tissue 
 
Introduction 
      Cartilage is a connective tissue consisting o f chondrocytes embedded in a 
complicated extra-cellular matrix (ECM) composed of  collagen, glycosaminoglycans, 
fibronectin, elastin, laminin and water [1]. Articu lar cartilage, being the most abundant 
cartilage type, can be divided into four zones, nam ely the superficial, middle, deep and 
calcified zones. Each zone has its distinctive matr ix organization, chondrocyte 
morphology and biochemical compositions [2], which plays important roles in its 
corresponding biomechanical function. Accordingly, the functional recovery of articular 
cartilage defect requires the reconstruction of the  damaged zonal structure. Unfortunately, 
cartilage tissue shows little tendency of self-repa ir and regeneration, owing to its lack of 
internal vascular network and low mitotic activity of chondrocytes [3, 4]. Consequently, 
articular cartilage injuries caused by osteoarthrit is or trauma often persist for years and 
result in scar formation, which is structurally and  functionally inferior to normal cartilage 
and eventually lead to further cartilage degenerati on (i.e., Secondary osteoarthritis) [5]. 
Several strategies have been applied to treat these  cartilage related diseases including 138 
 resection, cartilage shaving or other surgical inte rvention, bone marrow stimulation and 
tissue grafts. Despite some encouraging clinical re sults, these methods are usually 
associated with drawbacks like pain reoccurrence an d donor site morbidity [2, 6]. Over 
the past decades, cartilage tissue engineering has emerged as a promising approach in 
treatment of these diseases, which involves the exp ansion of isolated chondrocytes 
followed by delivery to the cartilage defects to pr omote in situ tissue regeneration [7, 8]. 
Efforts have been made to develop appropriate cell delivery scaffolds to create an 
advantageous artificial ECM microenvironment for ch ondrocytes to adhere and maintain 
their differentiated phenotype and function. Variou s naturally derived and synthetic 
polymers have been tested as scaffold materials [9- 11] and two types of scaffolding have 
been widely applied: porous foams and hydrogels [12 ]. Hydrogels are highly hydrated 
polymeric networks due to chemical or physical cros slinking of individual polymer 
chains [13]. Hydrogels are used as cartilage engine ering scaffold materials because they 
can mimic the in vivo chondrocyte growth environmen ts and preserved their 
differentiated phenotypes due to the highly hydrate d structure and maintenance of 
rounded cell shape [14]. However, their poor mechan ical strength limits their applications 
in load-bearing areas such as articular cartilage d efects [12]. Besides, it remains difficult 
to create a zonal articular cartilage structure wit h hydrogel materials, despite limited 
success to introduce three dimensional (3D) pattern ing structure to hydrogels to alter their 
normal isotropic structure [15]. Porous foams, in c ontrast, usually have better mechanical 139 
 properties and are easier to design architectural s tructure [12]. However, chondrocytes 
cultured on most of the porous foam scaffolds lost their rounded morphology quickly and 
therefore de-differentiated [16, 17]. In our previo us study, macro-porous PLLA scaffolds 
with nano-fibrous (NF) matrix structure were shown to support chondrogenic 
differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenc hymal stem cells (hMSCs). Cells 
showed a more rounded shape on the NF matrix and th e porous NF scaffolds were able to 
support long-term 3D cartilaginous development [18] , indicating the importance of 
bio-mimicking NF structures in cartilage engineerin g. Electrospinning is another 
commonly used method to create porous NF or micro-f ibrous architecture [19, 20]. 
However, the pores are too small to allow deep cell  penetration when the fibers are at the 
nano-scale. Therefore the electrospun NF mesh is mo re suitable for regeneration of the 
thinner surface layer of cartilage.  
    In this study, a two-layered composite scaffold  was fabricated, which combined the 
two nano-fiber fabrication techniques, with a thin electrospun NF top layer mimicking 
the superficial zone and a phase-separated NF botto m layer mimicking the middle zone. 
And the effect of the anisotropic architecture of c omposite scaffolds on in vitro 
chondrogenesis of hMSCs was investigated.  
 
Materials and  methods 
Materials 140 
       Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) with inherent vis cosity of 1.6 dl/g was purchased 
from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany). D-f ructose (m.p. 119-122Â°C) is from 
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Tetrahydrofuran, acetone, cy clohexane, hexane and 
dichloromethane were purchased from Fisher Scientif ic (Pittsburgh, PA). 
 
Fabrication of NF PLLA composite scaffolds   
      The composite scaffold is composed of two lay ers: a top layer fabricated by 
electrospinning method and a bottom layer fabricate d by temperature induced phase 
separation method combined with sugar sphere templa te and leaching technique. The 
schematic diagram of fabrication process is illustr ated in Figure 1. Fabrication of bottom 
phase-separation layer has been described previousl y [21]. Briefly, 10 wt/v% 
PLLA/tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution was cast into a n assembled sugar sphere template 
(sphere diameters were 125-250 Âµm, 250-425 Âµm and 425-600 Âµm respectively for small, 
medium and large pore scaffolds) under vacuum. The polymer-sugar construct was phase 
separated at -20Â°C overnight and then immersed into  cyclohexane to exchange THF for 
2 days. The construct was then freeze-dried and the  sugar sphere templates were leached 
out in distilled water to obtain highly porous scaf folds. Scaffolds were cut into circular 
disks with dimensions of 3.6 mm in diameter and 1 m m in thickness. A top layer of PLLA 
NF or micro-fibrous mesh was then electrospun onto the bottom layer to fabricate 
composite scaffolds. Briefly, The PLLA was dissolve d in chloform/acetone mixture (2:1 
V/V) with a concentration of 6, 8 or 12 wt/v%. The prepared PLLA solution was then fed 141 
 into a plastic syringe with a needle (inner diamete r of 0.18 mm). A syringe pump (Model 
# 78-01001, Fisher Scientific) was used to feed the  solution to needle at a feed rate of 1.5 
mL/hr. An external voltage of 18kV was applied to t he needle using a high-voltage power 
supplier (Model # ES30P-5w, Gamma High voltage). Th e phase separated bottom layer 
was placed on a grounded collection plate of alumin um foil, located at a fixed distance of 
12 mm from the needle tip. After the fabrication of  top electrospun layer with desired 
thickness (50 Âµm-250 Âµm) by adjusting the total electrospinning time, the  composite 
scaffold was subjected to a vapor of a mixture of h exane/THF (9:1 V/V) for 30 min to 
increase the bonding between the two layers. After that, the composite scaffolds were 
vacuum-dried for 3 days to remove the remaining sol vent. Some of the scaffolds were 
sterilized with ethylene oxide for cell culture stu dies.      
 
Characterization of scaffolds 
      The thickness of the top layer and bottom lay er was measured with a micrometer. 
The morphology of the composite scaffold was examin ed using a scanning electron 
microscope (SEM, Philips XL30 FEG). The measurement  of nano-fiber diameters was 
performed according to a previous report [22]. Fibe r orientation was counted with a 
representative cross-section of composite scaffolds . 
 
Cell seeding and culture 142 
       Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem ce lls (hMSCs) were obtained 
from Lonza Walkersville, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). T he cells were cultured according to 
the manual provided by the supplier. Scaffolds (3.6  mm in diameter and 1 mm in 
thickness) were soaked in 70% ethanol for 30 min, w ashed three times with PBS for 30 
min each, and twice in complete medium for 2 hr eac h on an orbital shaker at 75 rpm. 
2.5 Ã105 cells were seeded into each scaffold from the s ide of phase-separated layer. To 
induce chondrogenesis, cell-seeded scaffolds were t ransferred to 15 ml polypropylene 
culture tubes and maintained in 0.5 ml chondrogenic  medium supplemented with 10 
ng/ml TGF- Î²1 (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The medium w as changed twice a 
week. 
 
 
Histological observations 
      Constructs were washed in PBS, fixed with 3.7 % formaldehyde in PBS overnight, 
dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, embe dded in paraffin, and sectioned at a 
thickness of 5 Âµm. For histological observations, sections were dep araffinized, rehydrated, 
and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Alcian blue. For each layer, 2 areas were randomly 
selected and the cell numbers per area were counted . Cell orientation in the top 
electrospun layer was counted with a representative  cross-section of constructs. For 
immunofluorescence staining of collage type II, reh ydrated sections were pre-treated with 143 
 pepsin solution for 15 min, incubated with collage type II antibody at 1:100 dilutions for 
1 hour, rinsed with PBS three times for 5 min each,  then incubated with FITC-conjugated 
secondary antibody at 1:100 dilution for 1 hour. Af ter rinsing three times with PBS, 
sections were mounted using mounting medium contain ing 
4â-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and observed u nder a fluorescence microscope.    
  
Statistical analysis 
      For cell culture experiments, numerical value s were reported as mean Â±S.D. (n=3). 
To test the significance of observed differences be tween the study groups, the Studentâs 
t-test was applied. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significa nt 
different. 
 
Results  
Morphological properties of composite scaffolds 
      A composite scaffold was designed with a top layer made using an electrospining 
technique and a bottom layer made using a temperatu re induced phase separation method 
combined with porogen (sugar sphere) templating and  leaching, mimicking the 
architectural structures of articular cartilage sup erficial zone and middle zone. 
Fig.6.2A-C show the electrospun NF layers with diff erent thickness (50 Âµm, 150 Âµm and 
250 Âµm respectively) formed on a macro-porous phase sepa rated bottom layer (pore size: 
125-250 Âµm in diameter) under the conditions of 6wt/v% PLLA concentration and 144 
 various electrospinning times. With the increase of  electrospinning time, the thickness of 
top electrospun NF layer increases. Fig.6.2D-E show  a 50 Âµm thick electrospun NF layer 
formed on macro-porous phase-separated bottom layer s with different pore sizes 
(250-425 Âµm and 425-600 Âµm in diameters respectively). The results demonstra ted the 
formation of PLLA bilayered composite scaffolds wit h tunable macro-pore size of the 
bottom layer and thickness of the top layer. Fig.6. 2F-G show the random shaped pore 
structure and NF morphology of electrospun top laye r, and Fig.6.2H-I show the uniform 
macro-porous structure and NF morphology of the pha se-separated bottom layer. The 
fiber diameters of this layer are in the range of 5 0-500nm.  
    Fig. 6.3 shows the NF layers electrospun from P LLA solutions with various polymer 
concentrations (Fig. 6.3A-3C, from 6wt/v% PLLA, Fig . 6.3D-3F, from 8wt/v% PLLA, 
Fig. 6.3G-3I, from 12wt/v% PLLA) formed on a macro- porous phase-separated bottom 
layer (pore size: 250-425 Âµm in diameter). The average fiber diameters of elec trospun NF 
layers increased with the increase of PLLA concentr ations from 155nm (6wt/v% PLLA) 
to 1750nm (12wt/v% PLLA), listed in table 6.1. The average pore sizes in the electrospun 
NF layers also increased with the increase of PLLA concentration. The formation of 
beads was observed in the electrospun NF layers at 6wt/v% PLLA (Fig 3A-C), which is a 
common phenomenon that occurs when low polymer conc entration solution is used to 
electrospin nanofiber mat due to its low viscosity [23]. Fig 6.3J showed that the majority 
of the electrospun fibers in top layer orientated p arallel to the scaffold surface plane. The 145 
 top and bottom layers of the composite scaffolds ha ve distinctive pore structures and fiber 
morphologies shown in both Fig.6.2. and Fig.6.3. Th e structural parameters of the two 
layers can be adjusted independently with their res pective processing parameters.  
 
Chondrogenesis of hBMSCs on composite scaffolds 
      The hBMSCs were seeded from the side of macro -porous phase-separated bottom 
layer. Then the scaffold was flipped over and the e lectrospun NF layer was positioned up 
during cell culture. The hBMSCs grew throughout the  whole composite scaffolds after 
2wk and 4wk of chondrogenic culture (Fig.4A-B) and an anisotropic distribution of cells 
and cell morphology developed. The cells in the ele ctrospun top layer were more 
flattened compared to the more rounded shape of the  cells in macro-porous 
phase-separated bottom layer. The top layer has hig her cell density than bottom layer 
during the culture period (Fig.6.4C). Consistent wi th the more paralleled orientation of 
PLLA fibers in top layer, the cells were more align ed along the constructs surface plane 
(Fig.6.4D). Alcian blue staining (Fig.6.5A) and col lagen type II immunofluorescence 
staining (Fig.6.5B) further showed the differentiat ed cells began to deposit cartilagous 
ECM into the scaffold more isotropically distribute d in the bottom layer and an 
orientation more in parallel to the surface plane i n the top layer. 
 
Discussions 146 
       This study aims at reconstructing cartilage z onal structure by advanced scaffold 
design and subsequent modulation of the chondrogens is process of stem cells. Attempts 
to grow cartilage tissue with native zonal structur e have been made by mimicking 
specific zonal cartilage separately on different sp ecific hydrogel scaffolds [27], by 
creating spatial gradients of growth factor concent ration [28], or scaffold chemical 
composition [29] inside scaffold, and by using diff erent chondrocytes from different 
cartilage zones [30]. Chondrogenesis is a tightly c ontrolled development event, involving 
multiple steps including condensation of mesenchyma l stem cells, chondrogenic 
commitment, and differentiation into chondrocytes. Studies have showed that the 
phenotype of cells can be affected by the physical architecture of scaffolds [24-26]. 
However, few studies have applied this concept to e stablish the anisotropic zonal 
morphology of articular cartilage tissue in a singl e scaffold, due to the complexity of the 
structures.  
    In this study, we designed a NF composite scaff old to support chondogenic 
differentiation of hBMSCs and facilitated zonal dev elopment. The results were consistent 
with our earlier publication that NF matrix structu res improved chondrogenic 
differentiation [18]. This novel bilayered composit e scaffold system offers several 
advantages: the composite scaffolds were fabricated  from one single biocompatible and 
biodegradable polymer PLLA, and the scaffolds were cultured with one single cell source, 
which simplified the fabrication and culture proces s. The scaffolds created a complex 147 
 zonal structural microenvironment for chondrogensis . The two layers of the scaffold were 
fabricated with different pore shape, pore size, fi ber morphology, fiber diameter and fiber 
orientation to mimic the complex organization of ca rtilage ECM in superficial and middle 
zone respectively. Chondrocytes grew in the two sca ffold layers showed different cell 
orientations. Chondrocytes in the electrospun top l ayer showed parallel orientation to the 
scaffold surface plane while chondrocytes in the bo ttom phase-separated layer showed 
random orientation. The chondrocytes in the two sca ffold layers showed different cell 
morphology, with a more flattened cell morphology i n the top layer and a more rounded 
morphology in the bottom layer. The cell densities in the two layers were also different, 
with a higher cell density observed in the top laye r than in the bottom layer.  Taken 
together, this anisotropic composite scaffold provi des a new strategy in constructing 
complex zonal cartilage tissues. However, further i mplantation studies are needed to 
investigate the in vivo performance of the bilayere d composite scaffolds. 
 
Conclusion 
      We have developed anisotropic composite NF PL LA scaffolds with a electrospun 
NF top layer and a phase-separated macro-porous NF bottom layer. The top layer 
mimicked the cartilage superfacial zone with small pores and more parallel nano-fiber 
orientation. The bottom layer mimicked the cartilag e middle zone with a macro-porous 
structure and more random nano-fiber orientation. I n vitro chondrogenesis of human bone 148 
 marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells study illustr ated the promise of this anisotropic 
composite scaffold held in constructing complex zon al cartilage tissues.

Conclusions 
        In this thesis, the fabrication of bioactiv e nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds and their 
tissue engineering applications have been explored,  including inhibiting bacterial growth, 
promoting angiogenesis, chondrogenesis, and osteoge nesis. 
        In the first study,  a three-dimensional (3-D) porous tissue engineering  scaffold was 
developed with the ability to release antibiotics i n a controlled fashion for long-term 
inhibition of bacterial growth. The highly soluble antibiotic drug, doxycycline (DOXY), 
was successfully incorporated into PLGA nanospheres  using a modified water-in-oil-in-
oil (w/o/o) emulsion method. The PLGA nanospheres ( NS) were then incorporated into 
prefabricated nanofibrous PLLA scaffolds with a wel l interconnected macro-porous 
structure. The release kinetics of DOXY from four d ifferent PLGA NS formulations on a 
PLLA scaffold was investigated. DOXY could be relea sed from the NS-scaffolds in a 
locally and temporally controlled manner. The DOXY release is controlled by DOXY 
diffusion out of the NS and is strongly dependent u pon the physical and chemical 
properties of the PLGA. While PLGA50-6.5K, PLGA50-6 4K, and PLGA75-113K NS- 
scaffolds discharge DOXY rapidly with a high initia l burst release, PLGA85-142K NS- 159 
 scaffold can extend the release of DOXY to longer t han 6 weeks with a low initial burst 
release. Compared to NS alone, the NS incorporated on a 3-D scaffold significantly 
reduced the initial burst release. In vitro antibac terial tests of PLGA85 NS-scaffold 
demonstrated its ability to inhibit common bacteria l growth (S. aureus and E. coli) for a 
prolonged duration.  
        Next, we developed novel tissue engineering  scaffolds capable of serving as both a 
three-dimensional (3-D) substrate and a localized a nd temporally controlled delivery 
vehicle for an angiogenic factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to promote 
cellular activity and stimulate tissue neogenesis. bFGF was first encapsulated into 
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanospheres (N S) with a double emulsion method 
and then seeded onto a 3-D scaffold. In vitro relea se results showed that bFGF 
nanospheres incorporated scaffold (NS-scaffold) rel eased bFGF in a temporally 
controlled fashion, which was mainly determined by the chemical and degradation 
properties of the bFGF-containing NS. Results from subcutaneous implantation into mice 
after 4, 7 and 14 days indicated that bFGF released  from NS-scaffolds preserved its 
bioactivity, improved cell penetration into scaffol ds, and enhanced neovascularization. 
Passive adsorption of bFGF onto the scaffold did no t show such positive effects. Results 
from subcutaneous implantation of scaffolds with di fferent PLGA polymer nanospheres 
and with different bFGF dosages into mice after 7 d ays also indicated that bFGF's 
function depended on its release profile and dosage . The cell penetration and 
neovascularization inside the scaffolds within 7 da ys were improved with the increase of 
bFGF release rate and dosage (up to the optimal dos age).  160 
         Then, we developed a novel PLLA nanofibrous scaffold whic h can achieve localized dual 
release of BMP-7 and PDGF in a controlled fashion w ith distinct dosages and release kinetics. 
Both ectopic bone formation and periodontal fenestr ation defect regeneration on these scaffolds 
were significantly improved over a single release s ystem. The improvement was dependent on the 
dosages, dosage ratio and the release kinetics of t he two individual growth factors. This 
nanofibrous scaffold with its controlled multiple g rowth factor delivery capacity can likely be 
applied to the regeneration of various large sized tissue defects.  
        Last, an anisotropic composite scaffold was  fabricated with an upper layer 
mimicking the cartilage superficial zone and a lowe r layer mimicking the cartilage 
middle zone. The thin superficial layer was fabrica ted using an electrospinning technique 
to support high density cell growth and more parall el ECM orientation. The lower layer 
was fabricated using a phase-separation technique c ombined with a porogen templating 
technique to support low density cell growth and a more isotropic ECM orientation. In 
vitro  chondrogenesis of human bone marrow-derived mesenc hymal stem cells (hMSCs) 
study illustrated the promising application of the composite scaffold to direct the 
formation of an anisotropic tissue structure that r esembles the natural articular cartilage 
superficial and middle zones. 
 
Future work 
        There are a number of interesting future di rections this research could lead to. This 
thesis has already showed that nanofibrous PLLA sca ffolds with the dual release of 
BMP-7 and PDGF could synergistically promote neo-bo ne formation and periodontal 
defect repair than scaffold with the release of eit her growth factor alone. It would be 161 
 interesting to apply this BMP-7 and PDGF dual relea se bioactive scaffold system to other 
bigger bone defect models. 
        This thesis also showed that nanofibrous PL LA scaffold with the introduction of 
controlled release of doxycycline could inhibit bac terial growth over a prolonged time 
period. It would be of interest to combine three bi ological factor (BMP, PDGF, 
doxycycline) release systems into PLLA scaffolds. P DGF is capable to promote 
angiogenesis, BMP-7 is capable to promote osteogene sis and doxycycline is capable to 
inhibit both bacterial infection and matrix metallo proteinases (MMPs). These three 
factors with suitable individual release profiles a nd dosages from PLLA nanofibrous 
scaffolds could function synergistically and result  in improved bone regeneration in 
defects.   
        Additionally, this thesis showed  that an a nisotropic composite scaffold fabricated 
using the combination of electrospinning and phase separation techniques could mimic 
the zonal structure of cartilage. The composite sca ffold can be further examined for 
cartilage tissue regeneration using animal models. With further improvement on the 
fabrication technologies, the composite concept cou ld be extended to regenerate more 
complex tissues such as osteochondral interface str ucture.
