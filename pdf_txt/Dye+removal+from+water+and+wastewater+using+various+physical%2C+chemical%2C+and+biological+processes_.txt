ABSTRACT  
Dyes considered harmful pollutants that represent a serious thre at to 
the aquatic environment, which require expensive materials to get rid of. It 
is consequently producing a critical situation that requires the availability 
of all efforts to solve, especially in conditions of water scarcity expected in 
the near future . Hence, the urgent need, to use cheap and eco -friendly 
adsorbents instead of traditional materials to purify and reuse water several 
times. It becomes one of the most important motives for conducting this 
research. This experiment was conducted, to compa re the effect of using 
low cost adsorbent material against  a traditional  one with various dosages 
and various contacting periods at an ambient conditions of pH and 
temperature that are suitable for aquatic animals to remove Methylene 
Blue ( MB) dye residues  from water. The highest removal efficiency 
percentages of 0.1 g chitosan and silica gel toward 100 mg/l of MB dye 
were 93.1 % and 86.9 % respectively, after 60 minutes of contacting 
period. The equilibrium adsorption behavior data were  fitted well to 
Lang muir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models. Based on the 
achieved results, we recommend that the use of chitosan in purifying the 
aquatic environment from some organic pollutants such as dyes, which are 
widely used in many industries, because of the ad vantages of chitosan, 
which are low cost, wide availability and completely safe for the 
environment.

Introduction  
Synthetic dyes are extensively used by many industries including dye 
houses, pulp and paper printers, textile dyers, colo r photography, 
chemicals, met allurgy, leather, paint , and coatings industry, food, 
packaging, pharmacy, plastics and as additives in petroleum products 
consume considerable amounts of water , and chemical reagents during 
processing, dyeing and finishing operations  (Zollinger , 1991 ; Selvam et 
al., 2003 ). The textile industry (54 %) discharges the largest amou nt of 
dye wastewater, contribut ing to more than half of the existing dye 
effluents observed in the environment worldwi de (Katheresan et al . 
2018 ). The effluents of these industries are composed of non -biologically 
oxidisable organic components because of the molecular size and Egyptian Journal for Aquaculture

 structure of the dyestuffs which can cause the disposal of these wastes 
into the environment can  be extremely deleterious, which affect 
photosynthetic activity in aquatic systems by reducing light penetration  
(O’Mahony  et al ., 2002 ). In Egypt, the problem of dye removal from 
industries wastewater has been considered of great interest, which 
requires the use of conventional methods for treating water, to meet the 
increasing demand for water for various uses. Based on that, a national 
effort has been launched to deal with this problem using natural, local 
adsorbents. Due to  the low biodegradability of dyes, a conventional 
biological treatment process is not very effective in treating a dye 
wastewater. It is us ually treated by physical and / or chemical methods 
(Garg et al., 2003 ). Although these treatment methods are efficient, they 
are quite expensive an d have operational problems ( Garg et al ., 2003 ; 
Kapdan et al ., 2000 ). In the past three decades, numerous approaches 
have been studied for the development of cheaper, ecofriendly and more 
effective biosorbents capable to eliminate pollutants present in syn thetic 
solutions contaminated with a single type of pollutant (Piaskowski et al., 
2018 ). Adsorption is a physico -chemical process which consider s an ideal 
option for de -colorization , which is evidenced of the effectiveness of 
adsorption for various dye typ es (Kapdan et al ., 2000 ; Porter  et al ., 
1999 ) and offers great potential for treating effluents containing 
undesirable components such as color, phenols, detergents, and other 
toxic or non -biodegradable and render them safe and reusable  (Gupta et 
al., 1987 ; 1988a ; 1988b ; Annadurai  and Krishnan  1996  and El- 
Sherbiny et al., 2009 ).  
Methylene blue, a basic dye, is an important cationic heterocyclic 
aromatic chemical compound  that releases aromatic amines (e.g., 
benzidine, methylene) and is a potential carcino gen ( Boeningo , 1994 ). It 
interfere s with a diversity of different fields, including the dyeing of silk, 
leather, paper, wool , and cotton, and the production of ink and copying 
paper, as well as the quality control test of concrete and mortar ( Berneth , 
2003 ). The choice of methylene blue as an adsorbent  is due to its known 
strong adsorption onto solids ( Özer  and Dursun , 2007 ). So , it has been 
used as an effective therapeutic  and antibacterial to protect newly laid fish 
eggs from being infected by fungus or b acteria in the aquaculture  industry 
(Tacon  and Forster , 2003 ). Several workers have examined  toxicity of 
dyes in waters on fish mortality ( Rana  and Raizada , 1999 ; Karanjkar et 
al., 2000 ) and  sensitivity of erythrocytes due to cell membrane 
permeability wh ich may alter their shape or even destroy them completely 
(Sharma  et al ., 2007 ). Methylene blue has been used extensively as Mounes, and Reham, , 2020; Egy . J. Aquac 10(4): 39-37

 fungicides in fish culture to treat fungi diseases. It is used to treat fungal 
infections of fish at  the early stages ( Drolet et al., 2004 ), It is effective 
against some external protozoan such as  Chilodonella , Costia  , and fungal 
disease, Ichthyophthirius  (Drolet et al ., 2004 ), this compound as an 
oxygen transporter, converts methemoglobin to a normal oxygen -carrying 
component of fis h blood, hemoglobin ( Anderson 2002 ). In addition, over 
the past two decades, there have been concerns about the potential 
toxicity of dyes and of their precursors, which poses a serious risk to 
aquatic living organisms ( Liu and Liptak  2000 ; Khalaf  2016 ; 
Katheresan et al . 2018 ). It has been reported that methylene blue has 
interference with oxidation reduction processes in fish and other aquatic 
organisms ( Anderson 2002 ). Due to repeated  and persistent  applications 
of methylene blue in fish ponds when treati ng for infections  and diseases, 
large quantities find their ways  into the water bodies affect treatment.  
Many studies have been made on the possibility of adsorbents using 
mineral absorbents  (activated carbon, peat, chitin, rice husk, soy meal 
hull, and a gro wastes ). However, the adsorption capacity of the 
adsorbents is not very effective to improve adsorption performance and 
new adsorbents are still under development ( Hasan , 2008). It is well 
known that chitosan has widely been use d in the preparation of various 
bio-medical products. Chitosan is easily prepared from chitin by 
deacetylating its acetamide groups with a strong ly alkaline solution 
(Annadurai  et al., 2012 ). This is the  most abundant biopolymer in nature 
after cellulose. This biodegradable and biocompatible biopolymer is 
interesting because of its wide range of applications ( Kumar , 2000 ). One 
of the most important applications is based on its ability to strongly 
adsorb a  wide range of pollutants, including metal ions and organic dyes  
molecules due to t he high proportions of amino functions. The 
deacetylated amino groups in chitosan can be protonated and the 
polycationic properties of the polymer are expected to contribute  to the 
charged interactions with a model dye, methylene blue, which is a basic 
dye. 
Among numerous absorbent, silica gel deserves particular attention, 
considering its high thermal and chemical stability, controlled porosity, 
swelling resistance, relative  rapidity in reaching equilibrium and high 
surface area ( Donia  et al., 2009  and Cestari et al., 2009 ). 
The present work aims to investigate the efficiency of Chitosan (as a 
low cost natural substance) against Silica gel (a traditional material) with 
water pH and temperature suitable for fish farming for removing Mounes, and Reham, , 2020; Egy . J. Aquac 10(4): 39-37

 methylene blue dye as an organic pollutant from water  which in turn 
could be used for aquaculture  and other purposes .     
Materials and Methods  
This work was conducted in Limnology Department, Centr al 
Labor atory for Aquaculture Research , Abbassa, Abo -Hammad, Sharkia 
Governorate, Agricultural Research Center, Egypt, to investigate the 
efficiency of Chitosan (as a low cost natural substance) against Silica gel 
(as a traditional material) with water pH suitable in fish farming  (7.2) for 
removing methylene blue dye as an organic pollutant from water  which in 
turn could be used in aquaculture . 
Methylene blue (MB) Preparation and Determination :  
In this experiment, Methylene blue (MB) dye  (Central Drug Hous e (P) 
Ltd. India) was used without further purification  (characterization of MB 
dye present in Table 1) . The dye solution was prepared by dissolving MB 
powder in distilled water  (Distilled  water prepared by using  a double 
distillation unit)  to prevent and minimize possible interference.  1000 mg/ l 
stock  solution of the dye was prepared by dissolving 1  g of MB dye in 
1000 ml distilled water , where the dye was stirred until it was completely 
dissolved.  Then, the experimental solution s were prepared by diluting  
definite volume s of the stock solution to get the desired concentration s. A 
standard curve of the investigated dye was prepared through  a series of 
different prepared dye concentrations  while distilled water was used as a 
blank (0 mg  / l). Absorbance agai nst each concentration was determined 
by using a UV-visible spectrophotometer  (Unico  UV visible 
spectrophotometer)  at a wavelength of 66 4 nm, and a standard curve was 
plotted in linear form. Then  the absorbance reading s of the blank and each 
standard were recorded. The residues of the investigated dye in different 
samples  after treating the prepared aqueous solution with the two 
investigated adsorbents were determined  at different contact  periods .

Chitosan preparation method : 
The Chitosan, which used in this experiment, was execrated from 
shrimp wastes (heads and scales), which wer e collected from El -Obour 
local fish market, Qalyubia Governorate, Egypt. The wastes were packed Mounes, and Reham, , 2020; Egy . J. Aquac 10(4): 39-37

in plastic bags and stored at –20º C until use. The shrimp wastes were 
washed, dried at 70○C overnight, grinded, then sifted to obtain a coarse 
powder at the required particle size, which is 60 mesh , and stored in a dry 
place until chitosan was extracted . The chitosan was extracted according 
to the method reported  by Kurita  (2001 ), and then preserved  in plastic 
stoppered bottles, which were kept  in desiccators to reduce  contact with 
humidity until use.  The chemical structure of Chitosan is shown in Figure

Effect of Adsorbent dosage and contact period : 
To determine the optimum dose of each of the investigated adsorbent 
materials  (CH and SG) , different dosages of each of them  (0.01, 0.02, 
0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09 and 0.1 g) were added separately to 
100 ml of 100 mg / l MB solutions. The tested solutions were stirred at 
room te mperature for different periods. The samples were taken at 
different contact periods (2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 , and 80 minutes) in the case 
of CH, while in  the case of SG the contac t periods were (2, 5 , and 10 Fig. (1). The structures of Chitosan  Mounes, and Reham, , 2020; Egy . J. Aquac 10(4): 39-37

 minutes). All samples were taken with two replicat es. Samples were 
filtered and the dye residues in each sample were determined with UV -
VIS Spectrophotometer  at a wavelength of 664 nm, and then t he removal 
efficiency of each adsorbent substance at different tested contact periods 
was calculated . 
Adsorptio n isotherm  
Isotherm data were analyzed using Langmuir and Freundlich 
adsorption equations. The two equations contain two adjustable 
parameters and different constants were generated (Zubair  and 
AbdelKhader , 2007 ; Khan , et al., 2005 ). The Langmuir and Freun dlich 
parameters were determined and correlation coefficients were calculated.  
The Langmuir isotherm in linear form is given as:  
1/X =1/ Xm. Kl + 1/C + 1/ Xm  
Where:  
X = is the amount of the investigated dye adsorbed per gram of the 
adsorbent.  
C = is the eq uilibrium concentration.  
Xm = is a constant which is refer to the monolayer capacity.  
Kl = is a constant which is a measure of adsorption binding energy.  
The linear form of Freundlich isotherm is:  
Log x = LogK + 1/n LogC  
Where:  
 K = is a constant which i s a measure of adsorptive capacity.  
1/n = is a constant refer to adsorption intensity. ( Uddin , et al ., 2007 ; 
Khan , et al., 2005 ). All the constants are specific to test conditions and 
the adsorbent type. ( Uddin , et al., 2007 ). 
The plots of 1/x versus 1/C a nd Log X versus Log C were made to test 
the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models respectively. In each 
case related respective constants were determined.  
Removal efficiency  % 
Removal efficiency percentage of different investigated adsorbents at 
differ ent contact periods as well as with different initial dye 
concentrations had been calculated according to the following equation:  
Removal efficiency % = (Ci –Cf / Ci) *100 where:  
Ci = initial dye concentration  
Cf = dye residue in the solution after treatme nt. Mounes, and Reham, , 2020; Egy . J. Aquac 10(4): 39-37

 Statistical analysis : 
The statistical analysis was applied according to Steel and Torrie 
(1980)  data of the frequent samples were analyzed with repeated 
statement ( SAS, 2009 ). For detecting the significant differences among 
means, Duncan Multiple range  test ( Duncan’s, 1955 ) was used .  
Results and Discussion  
Obtained results revealed that  both examined adsorbents (Chitosan and 
Silica gel) have proven ability to remove the investigated dye (methylene 
blue, as an organic pollutant) from aqueous solutions , with greater 
preference and efficacy for the less expensive adsorbent ( Chitosan) 
compared to the conventional adsorbent ( Silica gel). This effectiveness 
could be attributed to their chemical composition. Chitosan had attention 
as an effective biosorbent du e to: its (1) h igh hydrophilicity of the 
polymer due to hydroxyl groups  of glucose units; (2) presence of a large 
number of functional groups (acetamido, primary amino and/ or hydroxyl 
groups); (3) the high chemical reactivity of these groups; (4)  the flexible 
structure of the polymer chain  (Crini , 2005  and Bhatnagar  and 
Sillan pää 2009 ).  
MB dye residues  at different contact periods by different dosages of 
both adsorbe nts: 
As shown in Tables (3 and 4), MB residues decreased rapidly in the 
investigated solution within the first 2 minutes; and then decreased 
gradually with the increase of the contacting period with both investigated 
adsorbent s per 1 00 ml of the solution; until 80 minutes in case of 
Chitosan  and 10 minutes in case of Silica gel . Silica gel has high surface 
area, tunable and uniform pore s structure, high pore volume, ordered pore 
structure , and mechanical stability which make it binding fast with dye 
particl es more than chitosan  (Yan et al. 2006a  and Chen  et al. 2012 ).  
As obtained from Tables (3 and 4) , the lowest residue of MB dye in the 
case of Chitosan adsorbent  was 6.9 (mg / l) on dose 0.1 g  after 60 and 80 
minutes , while the highest one was  43.7 (mg / l)  on dose 0.02 g afte r 2 
minutes  and the lowest record  of Mb dye residue in  case of Silica gel 
adsorbent  was 13.1 (mg / l)  on dose 0.1g after 10 minutes, while the 
highest one was 28.6 (mg / l)  on dose 0.05 g after 2 minutes of treating.

2 5 10 20 40 60 80Those resu lts were  in accordance with  Ngadi , et al . (2013 ), who  
mentioned that the adsorption efficiency increased with adsorbent dosage 
to a specific limit because there was plenty of surface area and more 
adsorption sites available to interact with the dye molecul es provided by 
the increased adsorbent dosage.  
The r emoval efficiency of different concentrations of both adsorbents 
on MB dye at different contact periods  
As shown in Figs (2 and 3), the 0.1 (g / l)  of chitosan achieved the 
highest efficiency  (93.1 %)  in removing methyl blue dye residues) from 
the aqueous solution after  60 minutes , while the maximum removal 
efficienc y % of Silica gel towards MB dye at different adsorbents doses 
were 86.9 % after 5 minutes  contact ing period , while the lowest removal 
efficie ncies of Chitosan  and Silica gel  toward s MB dye were 56.3 and 
71.4 % at dosage 0.02 and 0.05 after 2 minutes, respectively . These 
results revealed that  adsorbent dosage plays a very vital role in  the 
adsorption process for color removal . Similar results ob tained by 
Shashikala et al., (2013 ), who reported that the maximum color removal , 
was obtained  at a dosage of 0.1 g chitosan after  30 min  of treatment . 
(Gaikwad  and Misal ., 2010 ) found that, Silica gel removed 93 %  of 25 
mg/l and 94.6 % of 12.5 mg/l of MB dye solution respectively.

Adsorbent Concentrations (mg / L)% Removal Efficiency
2 5 10Several investigations demonstrated that although, increasing  
adsorbent dosage leads to a corresponding increase of ac tive sites for 
adsorption, but this phenomenon may not lead to high adsorption capacity 
and adsorption efficiency of adsorbent due to that the over load of the 
adsorbent area is decreased ( Verma  and Mishra , 2010 ; Lopes  et al . 
2004 ).

The adsorption isotherms : 
Adsorption isotherm describe s how the adsorbate interact s with 
adsorbents and which  are critical and optimizing the use of adsorbents. 
Thus, the c orrelation of equilibrium data by either theoretical or empirical 
equations is essential to the practical design and operation of the 
adsorptions system. As shown in Table s (5 and 6) the adsorption 
isotherms data  were fitted to both the Langmuir and Freund lich isotherm 
equations  for Chitosan and Silica gel, respectively . The typical graphical 
representations of the linearized plots are shown in Figures 4 and 5 for 
adsorption of MB on CH and SG, respectively, according to Langmuir 
equation; as well as in Fig ures 6 and 7 for adsorption of MB on CH and 
SG, respectively, according to Freundlich equation. The correlation 
coefficient values for CH and SG  were 0.9818 and 0. 9688 for Langmuir 
equation, respectively, while values for CH and SG  were 0.9145  and

 CONCLUSION 
From the previous data, we conclude that the use of both the 
investigated adsorbents contributed to the removing  of the methyl blue 
dye that can be found in the aquatic environment, and cause harmful 
effect to fish and aquatic organisms and, consequently to humans , with 
the preference of  using chitosan and such natural materials , because of its 
advant age represented in low cost, wide availability and quite safe for the 
environment.

الملخص العربي  
تعتبر األصباغ من الملوثات الضار ه  التي تشكل تهديداً خطيراً  للبيئه  المائيه،  والتي تتطلب 
مواد باهظة الثمن للتخلص منها،   وبالتبعيه  ينتج عنه وضع حر ج يتطلب توافر جميع الجهود 
لحلها، خاصة في ظروف ندرة المياه المتوقع ه  في المستقبل القريب.  ومن هنا كانت الحاجة الماسه  
الستخدام مواد  إدمصاص  رخيصة  الثمن  وصديقة للبيئة  بدالً   من المواد  التقليديه  لتنقية  المياه  
وإعادة استخدام ها  عدة مرات، و هو  من أهم الدوافع إلجراء هذا البحث. أجريت هذه التجرب ه   
لمقارنة تأثير   استخدام مادة  ممتز ه  منخفضة التكلفه  مقابل  ماده  تقليديه  بجرعات مختلف ه  مع  فترات  
معالجه  مختلفه  في ظل ظروف محيطه من األس الهيدروجيني  ودرجة الحراره المناسبه  لتربية 
األحياء المائيه  إلزالة بقايا صبغة الميثيلين األزرق  من المياه.  أقصى كفاءة  لإلزالة   بجرعه  0.1  
جم من الشيتوزان وهالم السيليكا تجاه 100 مجم / لتر من صبغة الميثيل األزرق  كانت 93.1 % 
  و 86.9    %   على التواليبعد فترة   معالجة  60  دقيقه.  تم  تطبيق  بيانات سلوك  اإلدمصاص  جيدًا  
علي  النموذجان  الرياضيان  النجموير  وفرندليتش.  وبناءا علي النتائج المحققه،   نوصي بإستخدام 
مادة الشيتوزان في تنقية البيئه  المائيه  من بعض الملوثات العضويه  كالصبغات والمستخدمه  بكثره   
في العديد من الصناعات، لما يتميز  به الشيتوزان من مزايا     متمثله في  التكلفه المنخفضه  والتوافر  
الواسع واآلمن تمامًا على البيئه. 
 
الكلمات المفتاحيه:  الميثيل األزرق، الصبغه، الشيتوزان و سيلكا جيل.
