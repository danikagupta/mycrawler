Organisms produce ligninolytic en zymes in order to degrade ligno cellulosic materials. Mainly, 
such enzymes are found in the fungal kingdom and are particularly widespread in the phylum Basidiomycota. The ligninolytic system of fungi consists of peroxidases (manganese 
peroxidases - MnP, lignin peroxidases - LiP an d versatile peroxidases - VP) and laccases 
which for substrate degradation are secreted by the fungus into the environment. Ligninolytic enzymes can be produced by cultivating adequate fungi either in submerged fermentation (SmF) or solid state fermentation (SSF). An introduction to these fermentation techniques is presented with regard to enzymes which are relevant fo r the wood processing 
industry. Laccases as main representative of  the ligninolytic system can be used for 
delignification and bleaching in the pulp and paper industry, in the production of wood composites and to alter wood properties. Production and biochemical characterisations are in the focus of this PhD thesis.   As an example for the production of ligninolytic enzymes, the ligninolytic system of the 
white-rot fungus 
Pleurotus ostreatus  showing laccase and peroxidases activity in SSF was 
experimentally studied. It was shown that the enzymatic activities of all the enzymes 
detected during SSF on wheat straw depend on the life cycle of the fungus. During 
vegetative growth phases of P. ostreatus , enzyme activities were high; they dropped upon 
initiation of fruiting body formation and were almost undectable after harvest of the mature fruiting bodies. In this study, maximum activiti es of 1.1-1.3 U/ml for laccase, 15-16 U/ml for 
MnP and 1.1-1.4 U/ml for VP were reached. Ge nerally, the crude culture broth of the SSF on 
wheat straw had a brownish colour, which prob ably resulted from phenolic compounds and 
other impurities, restricting the biotechnological usage of the unpurified enzymes.  Industrial production of fungal enzymes and ot her metabolites is normally done in SmF, due 
to easier handling, better repr oducibility and easy to establish standard operation processes. 
In liquid cultures during SmF, filamentous fungi can grow in free  filamentous or in 
aggregated forms, known as pellets. The morphological type of growth is influenced by various factors, such as agitation or steerin g speed, cultivation temperature, pH and many 
more, and can influence production efficiencies of a fungal strain. In a combined study, I observed the morphology and laccase yield of the basidiomycete 
Coprinopsis cinerea  FA2222 
transformed with a plasmid containing the homologue laccase gene lcc1 under control of the 
Agaricus bisporus  gpdII -promoter in shaken flask and stirred bioreactor cultures. The  viii C. cinerea  transformant showed pelleted growth in both types of cultivation, whereas in 
shake flask cultures at 120 rpm a more uniform and smaller pellet size was observed 
compared to the cultures grown in a stirred bior eactor at a stirring speed 120 rpm. In stirred 
bioreactor cultures, where distinct pH values were kept constant, a higher fragmentation rate of the pellets occurred at pH 7 and pH 8 as compared to pH 6. In contrast at pH 6, pellets of a more similar size occurred and highest laccase ac tivities in stirred bioreactor cultures were 
obtained. In the shake flask cultures incubated at 25 °C and 37 °C highest total laccase activities of up to 10 U/ml were reached at the lower temperature of 25 °C. Microtome cuttings of the embedded pellets derived from shake flask cultures at 25 °C had a smooth appearance with a dense outer zone and a le ss dense inner region. On the other hand, 
pellets formed at 37 °C showed a hairy look with a broader and less dense surface.   To analyse native production of laccases in 
C. cinerea , ten different monokaryotic strains of 
this fungus were tested at 25 °C and 37 °C  for their ability to produce laccase in liquid 
shaken cultures in two different media, respecti vely. Overall, laccase yields were higher at 
25 °C than at 37 °C for nine strains whilst one strain (LN118) produce no or only negligible 
amounts of laccase at both temperatures. In seven of the strains, laccase yields of around 1 U/ml or more were detected in glucose based media cultures at 25 °C. The laccase activity in these seven strains resulted from two or more laccase isoenzymes and/or isoforms as 
determined by LC-MS/MS. Five different isoenzymes were detected via LC-MS/MS in varying combinations in the different strains which were identified to be Lcc1, Lcc2, Lcc5, Lcc9 and 
Lcc10. In all strains, Lcc1 and Lcc5 were produced at highest amounts. Additionally to the 
native laccase production, improvement of re combinant laccase production of a single 
isoenzyme in 
C. cinerea  was achieved. Culturing optimisation with different known C. cinerea  
media revealed that a glucose-based medium (m odified Kjalke) gave highest laccase yields. 
In total, recombinant laccase activity from cu lture supernatants were improved from values 
of around 3 U/ml for a C. cinerea  FA2222 laccase lcc1 transformant in to more than 10 U/ml 
for a C. cinerea  LN118 laccase lcc1 transformant both cultivated at 37 °C. 
 Other than Lcc1, laccases Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7 were recombinantly produced in 
C. cinerea  
FA2222 at 37 °C. Laccases were purified from the supernatant of shake flask cultures. The optimal reaction temperature, optimal pH value and kinetic parameters for four different laccase substrates were analysed. Stability te sts regarding temperat ure, pH and organic 
solvents were conducted, reve aling Lcc5 to be a good candidate for reactions in high 
concentrations of organic solvents. Additiona lly, the 3-dimensional structure of Lcc5 was 
determined via X-ray.  ixZusammenfassung 
 
Ligninolytische Enzyme werden von Mikroorganismen produziert mit dem Zweck, Lignocellulose abzubauen. Ve rschiedene ligninolytische En zyme, wie Peroxidasen (Mangan-
Peroxidasen - MnP, Lignin-Peroxidasen - LiP und versatile-Peroxidasen - VP) und Laccasen 
werden überwiegend von Pilzen , insbesondere Basidiomyceten zum Substratabbau in ihre 
Umgebung sekretiert.  Ligninolytische Enzyme können industriell du rch Kultivierung von entsprechenden Pilzen 
sowohl in submersen Fermentationsverfahren (SmF) als auch in Feststoffermentationen 
(SSF) hergestellt werden. Zu Beginn dieser Arbeit werden beide Fermentationssysteme dargestellt und ihr Einsatz bei der Produktion von Enzymen, die für die Holzwerkstoffindustrie von Interesse sind, disk utiert. Der Schwerpunkt der Betrachtung liegt 
dabei auf den Laccasen, die als eine der wic htigsten Enzymklassen im ligninolytischen 
System von Pilzen zum Delignifizieren und Bleichen von Papier und Pülpe, zur Herstellung von Holzwerkstoffen und zur Veredelung von Hö lzern eingesetzt werden. Die Produktion von 
Laccasen und deren biochemische Charakterisierung stehen daher im Fokus dieser Doktorarbeit. Für diese Arbeit wurde die Produktion von ligninolytischen Enzymen  beispielhaft am ligninolytische n System des Weißfäulepilzes 
Pleurotus ostreatus  untersucht. 
Während der SSF auf Weizenstroh wurden Peroxidase- und Laccaseaktivitäten nachgewiesen, deren Intensität sich nach dem Lebenszyklus des Pilzes richtete. Die Enzymaktivitäten in besiedeltem Substrat wa ren in den vegetativen Wachstumsphasen von 
P. ostreatus  hoch, fielen danach mit aufkommender Fruktifikation ab und waren nach der 
Ernte der Pilzfruchtkörper kaum mehr messbar. Im Verlauf der Studie wurden maximale Aktivitäten von 1.1-1.3 U/ml für Laccase, 15-16 U/ml für MnP and 1.1-1.4 U/ml für VP erreicht. Extrahierte Laccase-haltige Kulturbrühe der SSF hatte eine braune Farbe, die womöglich aus phenolischen Komponenten und an deren Verunreinigungen resultierte. Diese 
Verfärbung schränkt eine biotechnologische Nutzung der unaufgereinigten Enzymlösung ein.  
 
Normalerweise findet eine industrielle Produktion von pilzlichen Enzymen und anderen Metaboliten in SmF statt, we il hier eine technisch einfachere Handhabung und bessere 
Reproduzierbarkeit in standardisierten Verfah ren möglich sind. Filamentöse Pilze können in 
solchen Flüssigkulturen entweder als freie Filamente oder als Hyphenaggregate, sog. Pellets, wachsen. Die Art der Morphologie des Pilzes in der Flüssigkultur hängt von verschiedenen 
Faktoren ab, wie z.B. von Schüttel- oder Rührge schwindigkeit, Kultivierungstemperatur oder  
pH-Wert, und sie kann die Produktionseffizienz eines Stammes entscheidend beeinflussen.   x In einer vergleichenden Studie  zwischen Schüttelkolben und Bioreaktor wurden Morphologie 
und Laccaseausbeute eines mit dem Plasmid pYSK7 transformierten Stammes des 
Basidiomyceten Coprinopsis cinerea  untersucht. Das verwendete Plasmid beinhaltet das 
C. cinerea  Laccase Gen lcc1, das in seiner Expression durch den Agaricus bisporus  gpdII  
Promotor kontrolliert wird. Der C. cinerea  Transformant wuchs in beiden Kultivierungsformen 
in Form von Pellets, wobei die Pellets in de n Schüttelkulturen bei 120 upm (Umdrehung pro 
Minute) gleichmäßiger und kleiner waren als jene, die sich im Bioreaktor bei einer Rührgeschwindigkeit von 120 upm ausbildeten. Im Rührkesselreaktor, in dem der pH Wert konstant bei pH 6, pH 7 oder pH 8 gehalten wurde, konnte man eine höhere Fragmentierung 
der Pellets bei den höheren pH Werten pH 7 und pH 8 feststellen. Bei pH 6 zeigten die 
Pellets allerdings eine gleichmäßigere Größe. Außerdem wurden die höchsten Laccaseaktivitäten in den Bioreaktorkulturen be i pH 6 gemessen. In den Schüttelkulturen, die 
bei 25 °C und 37 °C inkubiert wurden, konnten Laccaseaktivitäten von bis zu 10 U/ml bei der niedrigeren Kultivierungstemperatur von 25 °C  erreicht werden. Mikrotomschnitte von in 
Wachs eingebetteten Pellets zeigten, dass Pell ets aus den Schüttelkulturen bei 25 °C aussen 
vergleichsweise glatt waren. Ein dichter Ring  von kompaktem Myzel umgibt einen weniger 
dichten inneren Bereich. Im Gegensatz dazu waren Pellets bei 37 °C  vom Erscheinungsbild 
her eher aufgerauht und der äußere Myzelring war breiter und nicht so dicht gepackt wie bei Pellets bei 25 °C.  
 
Um die natürliche Laccaseproduktion von C. cinerea  zu testen, wurden zehn unterschiedliche 
Monokaryonten bei jeweils 25 °C und 37 °C in zwei unterschiedlichen Medien kultiviert. 
Insgesamt waren bei neun der Stämme die Laccaseausbeuten bei 25 °C höher als bei 37 °C, wobei ein Stamm (LN118) keine oder nur sehr geringe Mengen an Laccase produzierte. In sieben der Stämme wurden Laccaseaktivitäten von 1 U/ml und mehr erreicht, wenn diese in Glukose-haltigem Medium bei 25 °C kultivie rt wurden. Anhand einer LC-MS/MS Analyse 
konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Laccaseaktivität dieser sieben Stämme aus zwei oder mehreren verschiedenen Isoenzymen und/oder Isoformen resultiert. Fünf verschiedene 
Isoenzyme (Lcc1, Lcc2, Lcc5, Lcc9 und Lcc10) die in verschiedenen Zusammensetzungen in den einzelnen Stämmen vorkommen, konnten na chgewiesen werden. Lcc1 und Lcc5 wurden 
von allen Stämmen in hohen Mengen produziert.   Weitere Experimente wurden durchgeführt, um die rekombinante Produktion eines einzelnen Isoenzyms in 
C. cinerea  zu erhöhen. Versuche zur Optimierung der 
Kultivierungsbedingungen mit verschiedenen C. cinerea  Kulturmedien ergaben, dass das 
Glukose-basierte Medium (modified Kjalke) di e höchsten Laccaseausbeuten lieferte. Durch  xiverschiedene Optimierungsversuche konnte für einen Lcc1 Transformanten des C. cinerea  
Stammes FA2222 die Laccaseaktivität im Kult urüberstand insgesamt von ungefähr 3 U/ml 
auf über 10 U/ml erhöht werden. Laccase Erträge von bis zu 11 U/ml wurden auch für den 
Lcc1 Transformanten des C. cinerea  Stammes LN118 erzielt. 
 Neben der Laccase Lcc1 wurden auch die Laccasen Lcc5, Lcc6 und Lcc7 rekombinant in 
C. cinerea  FA2222 bei 37 °C produziert. Die Laccasen wurden aus dem Kulturüberstand der 
Schüttelkolben aufgereinigt. Ihre optimale Reak tionstemperatur, ihr op timaler pH Wert und 
ihre kinetischen Parameter wurden für vier verschiedene Laccasesubstrate analysiert. 
Stabilitätstests bezüglich Temper atur, pH und organischen Lösung smitteln zeigten, dass Lcc5 
insbesondere für Reaktionen bei hohen Konzentrationen von organischen Lösungsmitteln geeignet ist. Zusätzlich wurde die 3-dime nsionale Struktur von Lcc5 mit Hilfe der 
Röntgenstrukturanalyse bestimmt.

           Introduction 
 3I. Laccases: sources and applications 
The widespread enzyme laccase (EC 1.10.3.2, benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase) produced 
by many ligninolytic fungi belongs to the family  of multi-copper enzymes (Messerschmidt et 
al. 1989) that oxidise a wide range of substrates  through a one-electron oxidation reaction. 
In general, laccases contain four copper atoms distributed in three copper sites (T1, T2 and 
T3). The electron migration between the substrate and the enzyme is regulated by the T1 site, also known as blue copper  site (Solomon et al. 1996), and, thus, depends on the redox 
potential (= reduction and oxidation potential) of this site. In fungal laccases, oxidation 
potentials of the blue copper can vary e.g. between 0.46 V and 0.79 V as determined for 
Myceliophthora thermophila  and Trametes versicolor , respectively (Xu 1996; chapter 5). 
Electron migration in laccases takes place via a cysteine-hystidine pathway from the T1 site 
to the T2 and T3 sites. T2 and T3 form a trinuclear copper cluster, with one copper atom at the T2 site and two copper atoms at the T3 site, where dioxygen is reduced to water (Solomon et al. 1996, Ducros et al. 1998, Messerschmidt 1998, Hakulinen et al. 2002, 
Piontek et al. 2002).   Natural organic substrates, such as phenolic compounds, can be attacked directly by laccases with subsequent generation of phenoxy radicals (Fig. 1A), which can perform radical 
coupling or substitution reaction with other molecules (Solomon et al. 1996). In cases where physical (size) or chemical (redox-potential) prop erties of the laccase restrict an oxidation of 
the substrate, small mediating substances with higher oxidation potentials called mediators may be used (d'Acunzo et al. 2006, Fig. 1B). Mediators are activated by laccases via a monoelectronic oxidation and can afterwards reac t with substrates, which are not able to be 
degraded by laccases alone. Thus, non-phenolic substances may be degraded by laccases by usage of different kinds of natural [pheno ls, aniline, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA), 4-
hydroxybenzyl alcohol, cysteine, methionine] and non-natural [2,2-azino-bis-(3-
ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (A BTS), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), N-
hydroxyacetanilide (NHAA), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylp iperidin-1-yloxy (TEMPO) and violuric acid 
(VA)] mediators (Johannes and Majcherczyk 2000, Camarero et al. 2005). The combination 
of a laccase and a suitable mediator is known as laccase mediator system (LMS). Such systems are used in different industries (section 1.I.B) and may also be found in nature, where suitable mediators enable the fungal laccases to degrade recalcitrant substances (Johannes and Majcherczyk 2000).

A. Occurrence and functions of laccases in nature 
In general, laccases are produced by various microorganisms (certain bacteria and mainly 
fungi) (Claus 2004), but they are also found in plants (Andreasson et al. 1976, Richardson et al. 2000, Gavnholt and Larsen 2002), insects (Sugumaran et al. 1992, Kramer et al. 2001, Arakane et al. 2005) and even crustaceans (van der Ham and Felgenhauer 2007). In the latter cases, laccase is needed for melanisation/tanning processes as well as in the immune response and wound healing (D ecker et al. 2001, Lee and Soderhall 2002, Sugumaran 2002, 
Liu et al. 2006, Van Der Ham and Felgenhaue r 2007). Insects use laccases also for tanning 
and for cuticle sclerotisation (Kramer et al. 2001)  while in plants laccases are involved in the 
polymerisation of lignin (O'Malley et al. 1993).   In bacteria, laccases or laccase-like multic opper oxidases (LMCOs) were found in gram-
positive bacteria, such as 
Bacillus licheniformis  (Koschorreck et al. 2008), and in Escherichia 
coli (Kataoka et al. 2007), Pseudomonas  syringae  (Cha and Cooksey 1991) as well as in 
other gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonadaceae) (Sharma et al. 2007). In these microorganisms, laccases might be involved in a multiplicity of processes, such as pigmentation, Cu
2+ resistance, Mn2+ oxidation, sporulation and others (Sharma et al. 2007). 
 Most laccases are of fungal origin, where they  are found in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes 
(Hoegger et al. 2006). Usually, laccases are extracellular proteins secreted by the fungi for oxidation reactions outside the cell. They occu r in the soil inhabiting ascomycetous fungus 
Aspergillus nidulans  during the sexual (Hermann et al. 1983, Scherer and Fischer 1998) as 
well as during the asexual life cycle (Aramayo and Timberlake 1990 and 1993, Scherer and A 
B Introduction 
 5Fischer 1998). Another soil inhabiting deuteromycete fungus Pestalotiopsis  sp. showed high 
natural laccase activity, which could be further increased in liquid cultur e (Hao et al. 2007). 
Laccase genes and activity are also found in the ascomycete family Morchellaceae , where 
saprotrophic, mycorrhizal-like and faint parasiti sm growth was observed (Kellner et al. 2007). 
In the ascomycetous plant pathogenic fungi Gaeumannomyces graminis  var. tritici 
(Thompson et al. 2006) and Fusarium proliferatum  (Anderson et al. 2005), laccase activity 
was detected as well. Furthermore, laccases ha ve been found in thermophilic fungi such as 
the ascoymcetes Myceliophthora thermophila  and Chaetomium thermophilum  (Berka et al. 
1997, Chefetz et al. 1998, Maheshwari et al . 2000). Laccases occur as well in fungal 
symbiosis such as in lichens. There, species of the sub-order Peltigerineae  showed higher 
activities (mean 30fold) compared to other sub-orders, such as Lecanorineae , where low or 
no laccase activity was detected (Laufer et al . 2006). It is most probable that in these 
symbiotic fungal associations, la ccases are involved in the metabolism of secondary phenolic 
compounds, like lichen acids (Li sov et al. 2007). In a pathogenic association community 
related to the esca syndrome, a severe illness in vine plants affecting all open plant parts, 
(ascomycetes: Phaeomoniella chlamydospora  and Togninia minima , basidiomycete: 
Fomitiporia mediterranea ) all three fungi produce laccases (Bruno and Sparapano 2006). The 
authors believe that the white-rot basidiomycete F. mediterranea  laccase is involved in lignin 
metabolisation, whereas the ascomycetous laccases are important for the detoxifation of a polyphenolic compound (resveratrol) acting as  antioxidant in grapes. Furthermore, laccase 
activity was detected in liquid shaken cultures of 
Monotospora  sp., an endophytic fungus of 
the grass Cynodon dactylon  (Wang et al. 2006). 
 While laccases are present throughout the fungal kingdom (Hoegger et al. 2006), b a s i d i o m y c e t e s  a r e  t h e  m o s t  c o m m o n  s o u r c e  f o r  t h i s  e n z y m e  u n d e r  n a t u r a l  g r o w t h  conditions. In ectomycorrhizal (EM) basidiomyc etous fungi, noticeable laccase activity was 
detected in two 
Lactarius  and all Rusulla  species tested by Gramss et al. (1998). However, 
the highest extracellular laccase activity was de tected in litter degrading species tested also 
in this work. The enzyme activity in the EM fungi seemed to be basically intracellular, 
whereas the litter degrading fungi showed predom inantly extracellular activity (Gramss et al. 
1998).  In another study of EM fungi, laccase activity was found on the tips of 
Lactarius quietus  and 
Cortinarius anomalus  in oak forests (Courty et al. 2006). Highest activities occurred during 
spring time, which can be ascribed to the degr adation of the organic matter in the soil. This 
process takes place either to possibly obtain carbon (C) for the saprotrophic growth of the Chapter 1 
6 fungi or to deliver nitrogen (N) for the vegetative growth of the trees (Courty et al. 2006). It 
is particularly interest ing that the EM species Laccaria bicolor  has 9 different laccase genes of 
which 3 are highly expre ssed in ectomycorrhizas, 1 in fruiting bodies of L. bicolor  and 1 in 
mycelium of L. bicolor  grown on glucose rich agar medium (Courty et al. 2009). 
 From results of a comparative study of five di fferent basidiomycetes, of  which three are litter 
degrading and two white-rot fungi, laccase was stated to be the most frequent ligninolytic 
enzyme in litter degrading fungi (Baldrian and Snajdr 2006). Contradictory, Ullah et al. (2002) tested several leaf lit ter decomposers and wood degraders and found that, overall, 
the ligninolytic enzyme manganese peroxidase  MnP (EC 1.11.1.13, MnP, Mn(II):hydrogen-
peroxide oxidoreductase) activity was higher  in litter decomposers, whereas in wood 
decaying fungi the laccase activity was higher (Gregorio et al. 2006). In general, the wood degraders can be classified into brown- and whit e-rot fungi, of which on ly the latter ones are 
capable of degrading the lignin and, therefore, having a ligninolytic enzymatic system (Hoegger et al. 2007). Nevertheless, laccases were also found in brown-rot fungi, like 
Gloeophyllum trabeum  and Postia placenta  (D’Souza et al. 1996). A recent analysis of the 
established genome of P. placenta  detected 5 MCO (multicopper oxidase) genes, of which 3 
are obviously for laccases (Martinez et al. 2009). Contradictory, one typical representative of 
the white-rot fungi, Phanerochaete chrysosporium , has 4 MCO genes whose products are not 
laccases (Martinez et al. 2004). Th is emphasises the finding that P. chrysosporium  is lacking 
classical laccase activity (Larrondo et al. 2003).  
 The basic ligninolytic system of fungi consists of laccase, MnP and lignin peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.14, LiP, 1,2-bis(3, 4-dimethoxyphenyl)propane-1,3-diol: hydrogen-peroxide 
oxidoreductase), which are produced in diff erent combinations. Hatakka (1994) divided the 
white-rot fungi into 3 classes, according to the enzymes which are primarily involved in the 
degradation of lignin: LiP and MnP, MnP and laccase, and LiP and laccase. However, several studies show that certain fungi produce all three types of enzymes and other fungi exist 
where only laccase activity is detected (Table 1). The classification Hao et al. (2006) offers would comprise all possible groups: With the classes I, II, III and IV, respectively, producing only LiP and MnP (I), all three types of enzymes (II), laccase with either LiP or MnP (III) and solely laccase (IV). However, some  white-rot fungi are difficult to classify in this system, as a 
lack of enzymatic activities under tested grow th conditions does not indicate whether the 
enzymes might not be produced under altered conditions. The saprotrophic dung fungus 
Coprinopsis cinerea  has 17 different laccase genes which are differently expressed under 
altered cultivation parameters such as medi a and temperature (Schneider et al. 1999, Introduction 
 7Navarro-González 2008, section 4.I). However,  the production of ligninolytic enzymes of 
species such as C. cinerea  and Ganoderma lucidum  seems also to be stra in specific (Silva et 
al. 2005a, Table 1 and section 4.I). No MnPs or LiPs are present in C. cinerea,  L. bicolor  and 
P. placenta , but all of them seem to have another type of low redox peroxidase not closely 
related to MnP and LiP (Martine z et al. in 2009). Recently ava ilable genomes of the white-rot 
fungi P. ostreatus  and Schizophyllum commune  will show which genes coding for ligninolytic 
enzymes are present in these fungi and, thus, help to clarify the role of these enzymes in 
lignin degradation.

8 Besides the degradation of lignin, laccases have also other functions in basidiomycete fungi. 
Within the fruiting bodies of fungi, laccases may be involved in the cross-linking of the 
hyphal walls to guarantee a compact fruiting  body structure (Leatham and Stahmann 1981, 
Thurston 1994, Xing et al. 2006). Laccase activities were e.g. found in the fruiting bodies of 
C. cinerea (Navarro-González 2008), Grifola frondosa  (Xing et al. 2006),  Lentinula edodes 
(Zhao and Kwan 1999),  Pleurotus eryngii (Wang and Ng 2006a) and Pleurotus ostreatus  
(own observation). Moreover, during cultivation of at least some  of the mushroom producing fungi, laccase 
activity within the substrate was highest in colonised mycelium prior to fruiting. The activity declined and raised again after harvest, indicating a link of regulation of enzyme production 
to specific developmental processes. Such observations were made on protein level 
[
P. ostreatus  (Rühl et al. 2008 and section 2.II)] as well as on RNA level [ Agaricus bisporus  
(Ohga et al. 1999)]. The highest expression during colonisation is probably due to the degradation of the lignocellulosic substrate (Xing et al. 2006, Rühl et al. 2008 and section 2.II).  A different function of laccase was revealed in the human pathogenic basidiomycete 
Cryptococcus neoformans. Here, laccase seems to play a role in pigmentation. In cultures of 
the fungus, when glucose concentration was high  (>20 g/l), laccase production was inhibited 
and no pigmentation was observed. This effect showed that laccase production is glucose depending (Jacobson and Emery 1991, Frases et al. 2007).  
 In nature, laccase activities were found to accumulate also  in interaction zones where 
white-rot fungi are confronted  with other micro-organisms (Iakovlev and Stenlid 2000, 
Baldrian 2004), e.g. bacteria (Baldrian 2004), basidiomycetes (White and Boddy 1992, Gregorio et al. 2006) and asco mycetes (Savoie et al. 1998). Co mparable observations have 
been reported from laboratory experiments (Rühl  et al. 2007 and section 2.I). In laboratory 
experiments with two basidiomycetes that compete for the same biotope in nature, laccase production in liquid culture of 
Marasmiellus troyanus  was induced by the culture filtrate of 
Marasmius  pallescens  (Gregrio et al. 2006). The authors hypothesised that phenolic 
compounds, which are present in the culture filtrate of M. pallescencs , induced the laccase 
production. As phenolics are produced in nature to defeat foreign organisms, the reason for higher laccase titres in interact ing fungal colonies was explained by Gregorio et al. (2006) as 
a defensive mechanism. Also other authors stated  that phenolic compo unds, such as ferulic 
acid, gallic acid, guaiacol, p-coumaric acid, syring ic acid, vanillin and more, which are able to 
induce laccase production and secretion in f ungi, may be converted and, when dangerous, 
thereby detoxificated by laccases (Thurston  1994, De Souza et al. 2004). A proof that Introduction 
 9laccase is involved in detoxification of ph enolic compounds was also shown for the plant 
pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea  (Schouten et al. 2008). Although, laccase from B. cinerea  
cultures could not detoxify the phenolic antibiot ic (2,4-diacetylphloroglu cinol) produced by an 
antagonistic microorganism alone, addition of tannic acid resulted in a complete degradation 
of the antibiotic. Contradictory to the defenc e mechanisms laccases are involved in, the 
enzyme also plays a role in infection mechan isms. In a human pathogenic fungus, the yeast 
C. neoformans , laccase was found to act as a virulence factor by generating 
immunomodulatory products during infectio n of the host (Zhang et al. 2006).  
 
B. Scientific and commercial applications 
The wide substrate range of laccases makes these proteins all-round enzymes qualified for 
several uses in industries and ecology. Of  the potential applications, only a few are 
commercialised for the use in industry down to the present day. But several reviews about potential usage of laccases in industrial applic ations were published (Minussi et al. 2002, 
Couto and Herrera 2006, Riva 2006). In addition, laccases are discussed in more general 
reviews on industrial enzymes (Kirk et al. 2002, Schäfer et al. 2007). An overview on 
different potential applications of laccases is given on the followin g pages with respect to 
application in connection to their natural occurrence (lignin modification, bioremediation) and possible transfer of the reaction mechanism on artificial substrates (dye decolourisation). 
Strategies of immobilisation of the enzymes ar e described for uses as biosensors and other 
possible applications.   
1. Lignin modification: degradation and pol ymerisation 
The reactivity of laccases on lignin can be used in three different ways: a) the treatment of pulp to degrade the brown lignin, b) the modifi cation of wood fibre to produce fibreboards 
and c) the improvement of the properties of wood (Couto and Herrera 2006).  
 
a) Laccases and laccase mediator systems (LMS) in pulp processing 
The usa
ge of laccases in the pulp and paper indu stry is one of the most studied applications. 
For paper production, the lignin in the kraft pulp (pulp from wood defibration) has to be 
separated or degraded from the cellulosic fibres so that the brownish colour diminishes (Moreira et al. 1998, Pandey et al. 2000, Hakala et al. 2005, Ibarra et al. 2006). Chandra et al. (2007) tested several laccases from 
Trametes  and Aspergillus  species for their ability to Chapter 1 
10 bleach the Douglas-fir heartwood thermomechanical pulp (TMP). No differences in action of 
the tested laccases were observed. In both cases, additional supplementation of pure oxygen did not increase the brightness of the TMP. In several other studies of industrial and 
laboratory scale, different laccases were tested in the treatm ent of paper pulps (Sigoillot et 
al. 2005). Bajpai (1999), who reviewed enzy me usage in the pulp and paper industry, 
concluded that laccase alone as a bleaching ag ent did not give good results, as a higher 
polymerisation rate is achieved in vitro in cont rast to the required le vel of depolymerisation 
and degradation. A LMS can support the process as it contributes to the reactions in nature, where helper molecules (mediators) are secreted by the fungus or arise from degradation processes (Bajpai 1999). Laccase alone though  is less adequate than a LMS, since the 
protein molecule is too large to penetrate into the fibre of wood, unlike the activated mediator (Goodell et al. 1998).   The first LMS used in the pulp industry deve loped by Lignozym GmbH (now Wacker Chemie 
AG, Munich, Germany) is a commercialised an d patented application (Call 1986, Call 1990). 
By applying a 
Coriolus versicolor  (current used name is Trametes versicolor ) laccase together 
with the mediator 1-hydroxyben zotriazole (HBT), Call and Mücke (1997) were able to 
decrease the kappa number (I SO 302:2004: The kappa number ( κ) is an indication of the 
lignin content or bleachability of  pulp and used as an indica tion for the brightness of the 
pulp) down to 50-70%. A decrease in the kappa number was also achieved with laccase 
from Trametes villosa  and VA as a mediator (Barreca et al. 2003). Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  
laccase together with HBT as mediator decreased also the kappa number and increased the 
brightness of flax pulp (Sigoillot et al. 2005). A further improvemen t of the LMS can be 
achieved when using surfactants such as Tween. In a study where Ceriporiopsis 
subvermispora and Trametes hirsuta  laccases were used in combination with the mediators 
HBT and ABTS as LMS, a hard to oxidise lig nin model compound was only degraded when 
Tween20 or Tween80 were added to the reaction mixture (Elegir et al. 2005). This shows that research on the combination of specific enzymes and mediators can contribute to improve LMSs.  Besides the optimisation of the LMS itself by testing different enzyme mediator combinations, the right point of treatment during the bleaching process can be important as well. This was shown by Camarero et al. (2004), who used 
P. cinnabarinus  laccase together with HBT as a 
mediator in an industrial bleaching process of eucalyptus kraft pulp (Ibarra et al. 2006). Although the HBT radical seems to inactivate the 
P. cinnabarinus  laccase by reacting with its 
aromatic aminoacids tyrosine and tryptophan, another study on T. versicolor  laccases in Introduction 
 11degradation of dyes showed that LMS with HBT gave better results than most other 
mediators (Moldes and Sanromán 2006). A special effect of the LMS-treatment was re ported by Lund and co-workers (2001, 2003): 
Paper made from kraft pulp treated with 
T. villosa  laccase from Novozyme and different 
mediators, such as ABTS and HBT, had an increased wet strength. This increase in strength of the paper sheets was explained by covalent bonds that emerged in the lignocellulosic matrix from radicals generated by the LMS (Lund and Felby 2001). Also Chandra et al. (2004) using 
T. villosa  laccase from Novozyme reported an increased strength of paper 
derived from kraft pulp when incubation with laccase with and without gallic acid was 
performed. Coupling of gallic acid to the pulp fibres as we ll as phenoxy radical coupling 
between fibres within the paper sheet was stated to be the reason for the increased strength, compared to the control where no lacca se and gallic acid was used (Chandra et al. 
2004).  For further information on the usage of LMS in the modification of lignin, the reader might refer to the following reviews and the articles stated therein: Call and Mücke (1997), Bajpai (1999) and Shleev et al. (2006b).  
b) Laccase in the wood composite industry 
For t
he manufacturing of particle boards or medium-density fibreboards (MDF) laccase were 
applied in order to utilise the self-bonding properties of the fibre surface – the lignin 
(Kharazipour et al. 1997, Felby et al. 2002, Mai et al. 2004, Fackler et al. 2008). The self-
bonding process of wood composites with the help of phenoloxidases or other oxidising 
enzymes can be divided into an one-component and a two-component system (Mai et al. 2004). The first one uses the auto-adhesive properties of the wood (lignin) for bonding the fibres, whereas in the latter one the lignin is  being activated by ligninolytic enzymes and 
then used as a binder in the production of wood composites (reviewed by Mai et al. 2004 and Kües et al. 2007a). An example for MDF produced after the one-component system, where culture broth of 
P. ostreatus  wheat straw cultures was used, can be seen in Fig. 2.  
For both systems, higher temperatures for pre ssing as well as increased pressing times (in 
laccase-bonded MDFs compared to UF-resin-bonded boards) are needed. This is necessary to reach the glass transition point of lignin inside the boards, as lignin seems to be the main compound in mediating the bonding between fibres (Felby et al. 2002). The laccases depolymerise the phenolic ligni n structure, forming radicals on the fibre surface. These 
radicals can react which each ot her, building oligo- or polyme rs (Kharazipour et al. 1993, Chapter 1 
12 1994, 1997). It still seems to be unclear whethe r covalent bonds between the fibres or the 
polymerised lignin are responsible for the adhesi ve properties (Felby et al. 2002). Here as 
well, LMS systems seem to be a better choice, as indicated by results of Euring (2008) who 
used the Novozyme 51003 laccase product together with the mediator HBA for production of 
8 mm thick MDFs.

c) Alteration of wood properties with laccases 
Activation 
of wood fibres with the help of laccase reflects a possible usage towards new 
materials for the paper or wood composite indu stry (Grönqvist et al. 2003). Grönqvist et al. 
(2006) used T. hirsuta  l a c c a s e  t o  b i n d  t y r a m i n e  o n t o  l i g n i n  o f  T M P  f i b r e s :  t h e  l a c c a s e  
oxidises the hydroxyl groups of the phenolic compounds (lignin and tyramine) and the 
emerged radicals can polymerise. Another possibility to improve the prop erties of the wood 
fibres is their modification by attaching phen olic structures (like guaiacol sulphate) with 
oxidative coupling onto the lignin through action of the enzymes (Lund and Ragauskas 2001, Couto and Herrera 2006). For other potential applications in the forest products  industry see 
Widsten and Kandelbauer (2008).  
2. Bioremediation 
Harmful compounds, such as endocrinic chem icals, munition waste, organochlorines, 
pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
synthetic polymers, wood preservatives, synthe tic dyes and other xenobiotic compounds are 
contaminating soil and water (Pointing 2001, No votny et al. 2004). Removal of these toxic 
substances can be performed in different ways. Besides chemical or physical detoxification or degradation, biological alternatives named bi oremediation are developed (Ryan et al. 2005). 
In these bioremediation processes whole organisms (in vivo, see following pages) or their 
Introduction 
 13metabolites (in vitro), such as oxidative enzymes, can be used. In vitro bioremediation with 
fungal enzymes can take place in situ , when the decontamination is performed at the place 
of its occurrence (contaminate d soil, process waste water). Whe n the contaminated material 
can be removed and transported somewhere else (reactor, basin, etc.) the remediation can be performed 
ex situ  as well. The advantages of enzyma tic bioremediation compared to in 
vivo bioremediation is the selective degradatio n of pollutants, the utilis ation in environments 
where organisms cannot grow (salinity, pH, sludge, harmful xenobiotics) and an easier 
process control (Ikehata et al. 2004). Laccase an d the other ligninolytic enzymes of white-rot 
fungi (LiP and MnP) have a very unspecific substrate range. They are thus capable of degrading recalcitrant compounds, showing homology to lignin and other phenolic and aromatic structures (Pointing 2001).   PAHs are a large group of organic pollutants with an aromatic ring structure. Degradation of 
these compounds by laccase alone is less efficien t than a LMS, as it was shown for several 
PAHs oxidised by 
T. versicolor  laccase and ABTS or HBT as mediators (Majcherczyk et al. 
1998, Johannes et al. 1998) and Rigidoporus lignosus  laccase with HBT, ABTS and VA 
(Cambria et al. 2008). For other toxic co mpounds from the pharmaceutical and arms 
industry, like the ba cteriozide sulphonamides (Bialk et  al. 2007) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene 
(TNT) (Durán and Esposito 2000,  Nyanhongo et al. 2006), enzymatic coupling to humic 
substances in the soil reduces toxicity and incr eases retention time in the soil. Degradation 
of the endocrine substance bisphenol A (BPA) was achieved with laccases from Trametes  
species applied either in liquid or immobilised form to the BPA solution (Modaressi et al. 
2005, Diano et al. 2007). The LMS-type is not only important for a successful degradation, 
but also the bioavailability of the toxic comp ounds towards the LMS and the stability of the 
enzymatic system. Additional detergents or solu biliser/solvents may help in the availability. 
This was shown for the herbicide dymron, wh ich could be degraded by a LMS in which 
T. versicolor  laccase was applied with either ABTS or different natural mediators (Maruyama 
et al. 2006). Another detergent, polyethylene glycol (PEG), was shown to protect the laccase 
during removal of BPA (Modaressi 2005). A kine tic description of a sp ecific LMS towards a 
substrate was done by Potthast et al. (2001), who tested ABTS and HOBT (1-hydroxybenzotriazole) with 
T. versicolor  laccase for oxidation of benzyl alcohols.  
 Besides the degradation of toxic compounds found  in soil, much research was done on the 
treatment of waste waters from different indust ries, e.g. the paper and pulp and the textile 
industry, as well as on olive mill effluents (Ca ll 1991, Bajpai 1999). While the aim in treating 
wastes from the pulp and paper industry and in  olive mill effluents is to remove remaining Chapter 1 
14 phenolic compounds (Attanasio et al. 2005), in the textile industry importance lies on the 
decolourisation of dyes and pigments, deriving  from the staining process and found in the 
effluents. Worldwide around 10000 different dyes and pigments are produced and used in 
the corresponding industries (Rodriguez et al . 1999), of which 10% are lost in industrial 
effluents (Young and Yu 1997). Decolourisation of  dyes with crude extract of fungal cultures 
depends mainly on the laccase activity, as it was shown for 20 different basidiomycetes 
tested for their decolourisation efficiency (Nozaki et al. 2008). Via a zymogram (= native 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresi s with a specific substrate that indicates enzymatic activity), 
the authors were able to show that laccase is oforms, which were detected in the zymogram 
with ABTS, correspond to bands of decolourised dyes. Up to now, laccases of several white-rot fungi were tested for their ability to decolo urise dyes in lab-scale (Claus et al. 2002, Hou 
et al. 2004, Murugesan et al. 2006, Ben Younes et  al. 2007, Lu et al. 2007). Nevertheless, in 
the study of Liu et al. (2004) azo, anthraqu inone and tryphenylmethane dyes could not be 
decolourised by laccase from white-rot fungi alone. Only the crude supernatants, where also peroxidase activity was found, were able to perform a complete decolo urisation (Liu et al. 
2004). Contradictory, Claus et al. (2002) tested three different laccases (
T. versicolor , 
T. villosa and M. thermophila ) on the decolourisation of azo, indigo and anthraquinone dyes 
and showed that decolourisation is possi ble. The tested ascomycete laccase of 
M. thermophila  showed lower efficiencies compared to the basidiomycete ones, which is 
possibly due to the higher redox potential of the Trametes  laccases. However, both studies 
have in common that with addition of mediators a higher decolourisation rate was achieved. Therefore, studies to find new mediators for dy e decolourisation are of special interest such 
as the work of Camarero et al. (2005) who tested several natural phenolic mediators such as acetosyringone, 
p-coumaric acid and syringaldazine (SGZ) with P. cinnabarinus  laccase as 
LMS for treatment of dye effluents. In an  other study, an indigo chromophore was 
successfully oxidised by a recombinant laccase of M. thermophila  together with the methyl 
ester of 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethox y-benzoic acid (syringic acid) (Galante and Formantici 2003, 
Riva 2006). Moldes and Sanromán (2006) used  the two isoenzymes LacI and LacII from 
T. versicolor  in combination with four different medi ators for dye decolourisation. In this 
study, the aromatic mediator promazine gave the best results with LacII, whereas with HBT LacI showed higher efficiency than with promazine.  In addition to the lab scale experiments, approaches on pilot scale were performed for 
decolourisation of dyes. Stirre d tank reactors were applied to control the decolourisation 
reaction at a specific temperature and pH (Soares et al. 2006). The usage of ultrasound 
treatment, which leads to cavitations in aqueou s solution resulting in local areas with high Introduction 
 15pressure and temperature, produces hydroxyl radicals. The hydroxyl radicals can degrade 
azo dyes which may form into other harmful aromatic compounds (Tauber et al. 2005). To have degradation without toxic end products, Ta uber et al. (2005) combined a laccase from 
Trametes modesta  with the ultrasound treatment and, thereby, obtained better results in 
degradation of azo dyes. Promising results with laccase immobilised on aluminium oxide 
indicate that an immobilisation of laccases can give better decolourisation rates than using 
free enzymes (Zille et al. 2003, for further details see below). Notwithstanding certain drawbacks on the pilot scale, such as high enzyme costs and wide diversity of the dyes and other harmful co mpounds, remediation with laccases is an 
attractive and environmental friendly proce ss, and might find its way towards commercial 
usage in the nearer future, when costs of this enzyme decline (own opinion and Soares et al. 2006).  
3. Immobilisation of laccase for different applications  
Different methods for immobilisation of enzy mes exists, where enzymes can be entrapped 
into a polymeric matrix, covalently bonded or adsorbed onto a carrier and enclosed by a membrane. For the immobilisation of laccases, di fferent carriers such as  polystyrene (Pich et 
al. 2006), alignate (Brandi et al. 2006, Teer apatsakul et al. 2008), agar, glass beads, nylon 
membranes and many more were tested (see review by Durán et al. 2002). Immobilisation 
of enzymes is an important method since the enzymes can be recycled easily and reused 
compared to enzymes dissolved into the liquid (Kandelbauer et al. 2004). Another benefit of 
immobilising enzymes is a possibly higher resistance to pH changes and increased 
temperature stability, as reported for laccase from 
T. versicolor  immobilised on polysterene 
(Pich et al. 2006) and on a nylon membrane (A ttanasio et al. 2005). These changes in turn 
result in higher reaction yields, better supply towards the substrate and a broader application area.   Bioactive composites derived from cellulosic mi crofibres coated with la ccase and urease can 
store the enzymatic activity and may be used fo r bioremediation processes, e.g. in the paper 
and pulp industry (Xing et al. 2007). Kandelbauer et al. (2004) immobilised 
T. modesta  
laccase onto γ-aluminum oxide pellets used in an “enzyme-bioreactor” to monitor the 
decolourisation of different industrial text ile dyes inside the reaction mixture. The 
decolourisation rates of the te sted textile dyes were alike for the immobilised and freely 
dispersed enzymes (Kandelbauer et al. 2004). On the other side, a reduced reaction rate was 
o b s e r v e d  b y  M a t s u n e  e t  a l .  ( 2 0 0 6 ) .  I n  t h e i r  s t u d y ,  t h e y  o b s e r v e d  a  d e t e r i o r a t i o n  o f  t h e  Chapter 1 
16 enzymatic properties after immobilising laccas e onto a ferric nanobead which was covered 
with silica gel (Ø 30 nm) to entrap the enzyme s. Studies on the enzyme kinetics of the 
immobilised laccase showed a similar Michaelis-Men ten constant (K M) but a reduced 
maximum reaction rate (V max) compared to free laccase, which is probably due to a reduced 
diffusion of the substrate through the polymer matrix or a deactivation of the enzyme during 
synthesis of the immobilisation (Matsune et al. 2006).  The implementation of biosensors is one impo rtant usage of immobilised laccase. Generally, 
enzymes, antibodies, organelles or whole cells in the biosensors react with chemical compounds, generating an electrical, thermica l or optical signal (definition after IUPAC: 
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry). The signal is then transduced via an appropriate way, which can be an amperome tric, potentiometric, optical or another 
measurement, depending on the type of bioc hemical reaction (Pemmasani 2006). Biosensors 
based on the reaction of laccases with polyphenols could help in easily detecting phenolic compounds in e.g. wine and olive mill waste (G omes and Rebelo 2003, Mena et al. 2005) or 
low molecular phenols such as 2-amino phenol, catechol and pyrogallol, which were detected 
by 
T. versicolor  laccase immobilised on β-cyclodextrin (low-molecular carbohydrate) (Roy et 
al. 2005). An amperometric detection via a graphite electrode with immobilised T. hirsuta  
laccase was positively tested on detection of lignin and can be used in the future in the paper and pulp industry and for waste waters, e.g. to detect kraft lignin and sulphate pine lignin (Shleev et al. 2006a). Gomes and Rebelo (2003) applied a laccase from 
T. versicolor  
(Fluka) onto a polyethersulphone membrane and could detect catechin and caffeic acid, although the sensor did not dete ct gallic acid, malvidin, querceti n, rutin and trans-resveratol.  
 Besides, several other studies reported positive detection of  lignin and phenolic compounds 
with immobilised laccases in effluents of th e paper and pulp industry or other liquid 
environments (Freire et al. 2002, Roy et al . 2005, Shleev et al. 2006a). Furthermore, 
immobilised laccases may be used in biofuel ce lls, where laccase acts as a catalyst at the 
cathode, reducing di oxygen to water (Farneth et al . 2005, Kamitaka et al. 2007).  
 
4. Commercial laccase products 
Enzymatic treatment of textiles has a positive environmental impact, as less water, energy and chemicals are needed (Schäfer et al. 2007). Novozyme (Novo Nordisk, Denmark, 
www.novozyme.com) established in 1996 a product called DeniLite
® used for bleaching of 
denim textiles. In 2001, an Indian company (Z ytex Pvt Ltd., Mumbai, India, www.zytex.net) Introduction 
 17marketed a similar product called Zylite. The pr ocess of denim deinking or decolourisation is 
normally performed at a pH of 4-6 at 60-70 °C for 15-30 min; therefore, enzymes having 
optimal reaction conditions at these process requirements are favourable (Couto and Herrera 
2006). Another denim processing system was la unched 2007 by Genencor called IndiStar™: 
a LMS which is of a defined mixture of IndiStar™ Active, the laccase, and IndiStar™ Control, 
the mediator (www.genencor.com, Table 2).

 A biodelignifcation and biobleaching process of paper pulp with a LMS was first introduced in 
the 1980ies (Call 1986) by the company Lignozym GmbH and seems now to be continued by Bioscreen e.K. (Table 2).  Another commercial product, Suberase
®, is used in the polymersiation of cork phenols to 
prevent the production of the methoxybenzene 2,4,6-trichloranisole (TCA) in the cork stopper, which would cause a mouldy  taste (Conrad an d Sponholz 2000). 
 Besides the application discussed above in more detail, se veral other potential usages of 
laccases can be found in different patents. La ccase can also be used to lower the shrinkage 
behaviour of wool (Yoon 1998, Lantto et al . 2004). Lantto et al. (2004) demonstrated 
reactivity of 
M. thermophila laccase on wool with HBT and VA as mediator, but the oxidation 
level of the wool fibres was too low for a signif icantly altered surface chemistry of the fibres. 
In the cosmetic industry, laccases can be used within hair dyes instead of H 2O2 as an 
oxidant, leading to better handling [reviewed in Couto and Herrera (2006)]. Also for the cosmetic industry, several patents are availabl e, such as the ones submitted by the company 
L'Oreal (Martin et al. 1994, Lang and Cotteret 2003).   
5. Other potential applications 
Laccases may also be used in the food industry , e.g. for the clarification of juice or the 
oxidation of phenols. Other uses of laccases in this sector are given in the reviews of Kirk et al. (2002) and Minussi et al. (2002).  In the bioethanol production, laccases together with peroxidase enzymes are used for detoxification of the lignocellulosic substrates. The process leads to the degrading or oxidative polymerisation of th e phenolic monomers, which are toxic to the further used 
organisms such as 
S. cerevisiae  (Palmqvist and Hahn-Hägerdal 2000). As a result, an 
increase in the ethanol producitivity of 2-3fold was observed (Jonsson et al. 1998, Palmqvist Introduction 
 19and Hahn-Hägerdal 2000). A combination of lacc ases with other cellulolytic enzymes, such as 
cellulases and xylanases, was used for delignifi cation and saccharificat ion of wheat straw and 
softwood, which might be used for further proce ssing to bioethanol (Palonen 2004, Tabka et 
al. 2006). 
Polymersiation of different chemical substanc es by laccases is another field of interest 
(Mattinen et al. 2005): e.g. laccase of Trametes pubescens  was used for polymerisation of 
8-hydroxyquinoline, whose polymer act as an antioxidant intercepting the radical 
2,2’-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (Ncanana and Burton 2007). 
 
II. Basidiomycetes: higher fungi with a great potential 
The fungal kingdom encompasses a very large group of species. Depending on the basis of 
estimation (Brock et al. 2009) it is assume d that there are between 1.5 million (Hawksworth 
2001) and 3.5 million (O’Brien et al. 2005) fu ngal species worldwide, of which about 100000 
fungal species are known today (Hawksworth 2001).  
The basidioymcetes together with the ascomycetes are also referred to as higher fungi. About 30000 basidiomycete species are known, which distribute over different ecosystems, such as forest soils, wood, fresh wasters and even in marine niches. Especially the organic 
matter degrading basidiomycetes are important for our ecosystem making the most essential contribution to the carbon cycle (Kirk et al. 2001).  
A. Applications of living basidiomy cetes on lignocellulosic material 
To get to the cellulose and hemicellulose in plant materials for the production of easy 
metabolisable carbon sources (sugars), the lignin has to be removed to a certain extent. 
Several studies document these processes (Jonsson et al. 1998, Palonen 2004, Schirp et al. 
2006). For example, selective lignin degrading white-rot fungi were used to degrade the 
lignin in rice straw by incubating the fungus on this lignocellulosic waste material. For 
P. ostreatus , Taniguchi et al. (2005) showed that the total net sugar yield (calculated from 
hydrogen (H) and carbon (C) content) compared to untreated rice straw was increased almost 3 times, thus making the usage of the pre-treated straw interesting where lignocellulosic material with a low lignin conten t is needed, as in the bioethanol industry. 
Wastewater of the olive oil industry was treated with 
Pleurotus sajor-caju  to remove phenolic 
compounds. Subsequent fermentation with yeast resulted in an enhancement of the ethanol production yield (Massadeh and Modallal 2008). Spent wood logs from cultivation of the mushroom 
L. edodes  gave higher net sugar yields than non-inoculated wood and, Chapter 1 
20 subsequently, 50% higher ethanol yields (Lee et  al. 2008). Direct usage of basidiomycetes 
on wood was also applied for the cult ivation of fine wood particles with Panus tigrinus  to 
produce a natural glue (biobinder) which might be used in the wood composite production 
(Kondrashchenko et al. 2006). 
 Another biological application of basidiomycetes is their usage as biocontrol agents. Spores of 
Phlebiopsis gigantea  of the Polyporaceae were thus us ed to hinder degradation of fresh 
stumps by the basidiomycete Heterobasidion annosum  (Russulales) (Wolken et al. 2003): 
due to prior colonisation, P. gigantea  makes it harder for H. annosum  spores to colonise the 
tree stump (Kües et al. 2007b). Also other wood decaying fungi have been proposed as biological control agents: 
Bjerkandera adusta , Fomitopsis pinicola  and Hirschioporus 
abietinus  (Boddy 2000, Kües et al. 2007b). To hind er pathogenic fungi from attacking the 
roots of the trees, cord-forming saprotrophic fungi, e.g. Hypholoma fasciculare , 
Phanerochaete velutina  and Resinicium bicolour , can be brought into the soil (Boddy 1993, 
Boddy 2000). This was shown in Australia, where Armillaria luteobubalina  was controlled by 
Hypholoma australe  and Phanerochaete filamentosa  (Pearce et al. 1995, Boddy 2000). 
 
B. In vivo bioremediation and dye decolourisation  
In situ bioremediation of the ligninolytic enzy me laccase has already been discussed on the 
previous pages. However, not only pure enzymes can be used in the detoxification or decolourisation of soil and wast e waters. Complete living organism (as well as crude extracts 
of their cultures) might be used for bioremediation. A comprehensive review on the bioremediation of toxic compounds by white-rot fungi and their ligninolytic system is given 
by Pointing (2001), where several substance classes (munitions waste, pesticides, PCBs, 
PAHs, bleaching effluents, synthetic dyes, synt hetic polymers and wood preservatives) are 
discussed regarding their degradation by white ro t fungi. Nevertheless, in the following only 
in vivo degradation attempts of basidiomycetes are stated, showing that this phylum of fungi 
is very useful.   One important parameter, when in situ decontamination of soil and water with complete 
micro-organism cultures should be performed,  is the micro-flora of the environment which 
has to be remediated. As sterilisation would increase the costs and, probably, make the 
process uneconomical, the fungus has to colonise non-sterile substrates. Direct bioremediation in non-sterile soil was tested with added ligninolytic enzyme producing basidiomycetes, of which the white-rot fungus 
P. ostreatus  and the plant pathogen Introduction 
 21Rhizoctonia solani  were the only ones showing growth in  the non-sterile forest and field soil 
(McErlean et al. 2006). Another study in non- sterile soil demonstrated that litter degraders 
are able to degrade the added pollutants, whereas Stropharia  species showed the highest 
degradation rates for the tested  PAHs (Steffen et al. 2007b). Immobilisation of the fungi 
onto a carrier, either an inert or lignocellulosic based one, might help the fungus to grow in a 
more aerated and controllable environment. This technique is also named solid state fermentation (SSF). In case nutritive carriers are used it may be also  called solid substrate 
fermentation (Rodriguez E et al. 2004, Compart et al. 2007 and section 2.I). SSF for bioremediation was studied with several whit e-rot fungi with different carriers, such as 
alginate, ceramics, corn cob, stainless steel, wheat straw and wood chips, for the degradation of toxic compounds (Rodriguez  E et al. 2004, Compart et al. 2007) or 
decolourisation of dyes and other industrial effluents (Rodriguez CS et al. 2004, Dominguez 
et al. 2005, Boehmer et al. 2006, Pant and Adho leya 2007). Different SSF techniques for the 
growth of basidiomycetes with concomitant bioremediation were tested, such as fluidised bed reactor, packed be d reactor, immersion bioreactor an d airlift reactor (Ryan et al. 2005, 
Boehmer et al. 2006, Ortega-Clemente et al. 2007 and section 2.I).   The oxidative enzymatic system of the fungi is  the main factor for their ability to degrade 
toxic compounds. Bioremediation with 
Irpex lacteus  (Novotny et al. 2004) in soil and liquid 
media showed that, in general, the degradation rate correlates with the secreted extracellular enzyme. To increase the efficiency of  this in vivo ligninolytic system the addition 
of mediators helps to increase the degradation or decolourisation rate, as it was shown for 
Pleurotus  species degrading phenolic and non- phenolic aromatic pollutants in SmF 
(submerged fermentation) and SSF cultures with HBT or ABTS as mediator (Rodriguez E et 
al. 2004). Another possibility besides the usage of particular produced fungal cultures for 
bioremediation is the application of spent mushroom compost from the mushroom industry for bioremediation of soils and waters (Eggen and Majcherczyk 1998, Lau et al. 2003, Rühl and Kües 2007).  
C. Mushrooms as a valuable food  
Since the Stone Age, mushrooms served humans as food, medicine and psychoactive drugs, religious symbols, and helpful tools. As a nice documentation, in the bag of the iceman Ötzi, 
a mummy discovered in 1991 in the Alps, remains of 
Fomes fomentarius  (tinder polypore) 
and Piptoporus betulinus  (birch bracket) were found. A bit further south, fragments of 
Daedaleopsis tricolor  (a polypore bracket fung us) were dug up in huts of a Neolithic village Chapter 1 
22 north of Roma (Peintner et al. 1998, Roussel et al. 2002, Bernicchia et al. 2006). Within 
native traditional populations all over the worl d, there is tremendous inherited knowledge on 
mushrooms and their potential usages (Allen and Merlin 1992, Buyck and Nzigidahera 1995, 
Blanchette 1997, Mahapatra and Panda 2002, Michelot and Melendez-Howell 2003, Montoya 
et al. 2003, Chang and Lee 2004, Zent et al. 2004, Pieroni et al. 2005, Garibay-Orijel et al. 
2006, Lampman 2007) that, however, is in danger to be lost. Mushroom consumption and medical application of fungi is de ep-rooted in Asian countries, al so in their modern societies. 
In many European cultures, in contrast, mushrooms have been broadly neglected for centuries. Often, there is no practice of mushroom hunting by historical elimination of 
knowledge, fear of mushroom poisoning and other reasons (Benjamin 1995, de Román et al. 2006). Traditionally, mushrooms are collected from th e wild, unless a cultivation method has been 
established for a species. Mushroom cultivation started in China 600 years AD with artificial inoculation of twigs with 
Auricularia auricula-judae  (jew’s ear fungus, wood-ear mushroom), 
a mushroom common to the Asian kitchen. Also L. edodes  (shiitake) was first cultivated on 
logs in China, around 1000 to 1100 AD (Chang 1993, Luo 2004). In Europe, mushroom 
cultivation came up around 30 0 years ago in Paris during the time of Louis XIV, when 
gardeners first grew A. bisporus  (button mushroom) on beds fe rtilised with dung and, later 
on, in cellars and catacombs underneath the town (Ainsworth 1976). Until now, the ‘Champignon de Paris’ is the most cultivated mushroom in Europe and the world (Chang 1999, Kües and Liu 2000; Fig. 3, Table 3). 
Pleurotus  ssp. (oyster mushrooms, hiratake) are 
currently the second most cu ltivated group of mushrooms (Chang 2005, Tan et al. 2005, 
Yamanaka 2005; Table 3). P. ostreatus  was first artificially cultured at the beginning of the 
20th century by Richard Falck (1917), who in 1910 became the first forest botany professor 
of the “Institut für Technische Mykologie” at the Forest Faculty in Hannoversch-Münden 
(Hüttermann 1987, 1991), the predecessor of the Section Molecular Wood Biotechnology at the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Forest Ec ology in Göttingen. Cultivation of all other 
mushrooms domesticated up to 1900 (edible species: 
Flammulina velutipes  - enoki 
mushroom, enokitake, velvet foot, Volvariella volvacea  - paddy straw fungus, and Tremella 
fuciformis  - ba mu erh, trembling fungus; medicinal mushrooms: Poria cocos  – fu ling and 
Ganoderma  spp. - reishi) happened first in China (Chang 1993).  Introduction

Fig. 3  Worldwide mushroom production (including interalia: Agaricus  and Boletus , both basidiomycetes, and Morchella  and 
Tuber , both ascomycetes) according to FAOSTATdata (2005). Boletus , Morchella  and Tuber  are ectomycorrhizal species 
that are collected from forests and plantations (Yun and Hall 2004). Agaricus  will therefore present the majority of 
mushrooms in these values. This assumption is supported by the data presented in Tables 3 and 4.  
 
 
Since the nineteen-eighties, mushroom production booms with more and more countries 
being engaged in large scale mushroom cultivat ion (Fig. 3) and with continually increasing 
numbers of new species (sometimes referre d to as “speciality mushrooms”) with well-
established cultivation techniques (Chang 1999, Kües and Liu 2000, Chen 2004, Royse et al. 2005, Yamanaka 2005; Tables 3 and 4).

24 Nowadays, a large variety of mushrooms are cultivated all over the world. China still 
occupies the leading position in mushroom pr oduction and consumption, with more than 950 
different known edible species in the wild of  which about 50 are commercially cultivated 
(Chen 2004, Chang 2005, Yamanaka 2005; Table 4). 
 Commercial mushroom cultivation often bases on recycling of vast amounts of agro-forestry 
wastes. The variety of wastes reach from straw (wheat, rice, oat, …), reed grass, sawdust of 
different species (spruce, pine, beech, birch, pine, gum wood, …), banana and bamboo leaves, tree bark and stems, several husk types,  some scrubs and others (reviewed by Poppe 
2000). Cultivation of speciality mushrooms on li gnocellulosic wastes represents one of the 
most economically and cost effective organi c recycling processes (Poppe 2000, Philippoussis 
et al. 2001, Mandeel et al. 2005).

Commonly, mushrooms are understood as frui ting bodies of fungi that are edible 
(mushrooms) or poisonous (toadstools). Chang and Miles (1989) defined a mushroom being a macrofungus with an epigeous (above ground) or hypogeous (below ground) fruiting body, 
which can be seen by naked eye and picked by hand. In nature, more than 12,000 fungal species can be declared as being mushrooms, of which around 2,000 to 2,500 are estimated to be edible with a more or less savoury taste. Most of the mushrooms belong to the basidiomycetes whilst a few, including truffl es and morels, are ascomycetes (Chang 1999, 
Yun and Hall 2004)
. All mushrooms being commercially produced on lignocellulosic wastes 
are basidiomycetes. In contrast, the black truffle, Tuber melanosporum , is an ascomycete Introduction 
 25that cannot be cultivated in free culture but is fostered as an ectomycorrhizal species in 
combination with hazelnuts and oak trees. For further development, in vitro mycorrhized trees should be planted into fields with calcar eous soils with particular properties. After 4 to 
6 years, the first ascocarps (fruiting bodies of the ascomycetes) occur, but harvests start not before 10 years after plantation (Shaw et al . 1996, Olivier 2000, Yun and Hall 2004, Bonet et 
al. 2006, Mello et al. 2006). Nowadays, more than half of the black truffle come from 
commercial plantations (Hall et al. 2003). 
Tuber formosanum  is a related species endemic to 
Taiwan that is ectomycorrhizal to the Fagaceae Cyclobalanopsis glauca  and cultivated in 
man-made truffieres (Hu et al. 2005). In a few instances, fruiting bodies of ectomycorrhizal 
basidiomycetes have been obtained in pot- culture with a respective host (Danell and 
Comacho 1997, Yamada et al. 2001; see below for further informatio n). Because mushrooms 
have a high content of crude fibre, crude protein (usually 20-30% of dry matter), B vitamins, low fat, and nearly no cholesterol (for example see Braaksma and Schaap 1996, Manzi et al. 1999, Chiu 2000, Mattila et al. 2001, Sanmee  et al. 2003, Adejumo and Awosanya 2005, del 
Toro et al. 2006, de Román et al. 2006, Nwanze et al. 2006), they present a highly valuable 
food. Besides, mushrooms serve as medicine and for prophylaxis to keep good health. Fruiting bodies as well as fungal mycelia cont ain several bioactive co mpounds. For instance, 
fungal polysaccharides are recognised to have anti-tumor effects by activating various 
immunoresponses. Most of these bioa ctive polysaccharides belong to the β-glucans, like 
Lentinan from 
L. edodes  and Schizophyllan from S. commune  (split gill fungus), both of 
which are commercially available (Wasser 2002) . Chang and Buswell (1996) coined the word 
“nutraceuticals” to indicate the dual roles of edible mushrooms being natural food and 
facilitators of maintaining good health. On the other hand, the term “nutriceuticals” is used 
for mushroom or mycelium extracts that posses both nutritional and medicinal attributes 
and, being incorporated into a capsule or tablet, are consumed as a dietary supplement for therapeutic purposes.

26 III.  Aim of the thesis 
Enzymes that are involved in the degradation of lignocellulosic material, such as cellulases, 
hemicellulases, peroxidases and laccases, are us ed in different industrial processes. Such 
enzymes may be produced with fungi either in submerged (SmF) or solid state fermentation 
(SSF) systems. An overview on both production systems regarding the most relevant 
ligninolytic enzymes for the wood industry is gi ven in section 2.I. Production of native and 
recombinant laccases by sele cted homobasidiomycetes ( Pleurotus ostreatus , Coprinopsis 
cinerea ) is in the focus of the experimental part of this thesis. Questions of cultivation 
conditions, fungal morphology an d development, isoenzyme patterns and characterisation of 
laccases are addressed.   
Since basidiomycetes are filamentous fungi able to colonise lignocellulosic substrates in SSF 
due to their special enzymatic systems, they may be used to convert cheap substrates into a 
valuable product. Thus, one vital part of the study concerns the white-rot fungus 
P. ostreatus used for commercial production of mushrooms on wheat straw. P. ostreatus  
secretes ligninolytic enzymes to colonise th e lignocellulosic substrate. The task was to 
observe the production of ligninolytic enzyme s over the time in SSF on commercial wheat 
straw substrate as used for industrial mushroom production of P. ostreatus . Periods of 
production of ligninolytic enzymes (laccases as well as manganese dependent and versatile 
peroxidases) were found to alternate with fruiting body formation (section 2.II).  Although SSF has the advantage of using chea p lignocellulosic waste materials for fungal 
growth and conversion, technical enzymes are mainly produced in industries under submerged cultivation cond itions in stirred tank reactors due to the ease to isolate the fungal 
products from the liquid substrates. Furthermore, liquid fermentation can be performed in closed vessel systems with genetically modified or ganisms. Thereby, the products of interest 
may change by applying different recombinant strains of an organism whilst the overall fermentation conditions for the species remain conserved. Thus, there is no need to develop a new general production procedure for a new product with a new natural host. Currently besides bacterial hosts, yeasts and filamentous ascomycetes are mainly used as 
hosts for the production of recombinant proteins. However, these organisms have disadvantages (lack of proper post-translational modifications) in the production of enzymes coming from basidiomycete origin. As a consequence, newer studies employ also 
basidiomycetes in recombinant enzyme producti on (e.g. Kilaru et al. 2006). Unfortunately, 
there are still shortcomings in the knowledge about the behaviour in growth and morphology Introduction 
 27of basidiomycetes in shaken and stirred cultures, although several studies on cultivation of 
basidiomycetes in liquid cultures can be found (section 3.I). To obtain a better insight into the morphology of higher filamentous fungi in  liquid cultures, an literature overview on 
image analysis on determination of fungal morphology during different types of liquid 
cultivation is given (section 3.II) and then an  image analysis system was developed (section 
3.III). As a model, a reco mbinant laccase producing 
Coprinopsis cinerea  strain was used to 
study its morphology and laccase production in  shaken and stirred cultures at different 
temperatures and pH values, respectively (section 3.IV).  Previous work by other authors reported that 
C. cinerea  has 17 laccase genes that in liquid 
culture of at least the strains FA2222 and AmutBmut are not or only poorly expressed (Kilaru 
2006, Kilaru et al. 2006, Navarro-González 2008). Several other monokaryotic strains of 
C. cinerea  are available in the scientific community  that were analysed in this study for 
native production of laccases under different cultivation conditions (section 4.I). Nevertheless the fact that most  strains secreted laccases into the medium, yields of native 
laccase production was in all cases too low for any economical industrial production. 
Moreover, strains differed in the type(s) of laccases produced. For in dustrial purposes, a 
cost-efficient production process of specific laccases is needed. Another task of this thesis 
was therefore to improve the yields of recombinant laccase production in 
C. cinerea  for a 
possible profitable use in the industrial sector (section 4.II).  Individual laccases differ in their properties, such as in their optimal temperature of reaction, in their pH range of activity, in substrate affi nity and in stability (Baldrian 2006, Kilaru 2006). 
C. cinerea  laccases recombinantly produced by the st rain FA2222 may have special features. 
Therefore, one goal was to adapt a purification protocol for production of the recombinant produced laccases in 
C. cinerea  in complex cultivation medium. The main aim was the 
characterisation of the recombinant laccase concerning molecular, biochemical, kinetic and structural properties (chapter 5).  For an easy overview, the following list of lit erature and experimental tasks summarises the 
main aims of this thesis: 1. Review on the production of ligninolytic enzymes (section 2.I)  2. Observation of ligninolytic enzyme production in SSF of 
P. ostreatus  (section 2.II) 
3. Literature survey on fermentation of basidiomycetes in liquid cultures (section 3.I) 4. Literature overview on tools for observation and analysis of fungal morphology in 
liquid cultures (section 3.II) Chapter 1 
28 5.  Development of an image analysis syst em for morphological st udies of filamentous 
fungi in SmF (section 3.III) 
6.  Determination of C. cinerea  morphology in shake flask an d stirred bioreactor cultures 
(section 3.IV) 
7. Study of native laccase production in C. cinerea  strains under different cultivation 
conditions (section 4.I) 
8. Optimisation of recombinant laccase production in C. cinerea (section 4.II) 
9. Characterisation of the recombinant produced C. cinerea  laccases (chapter 5) 
  
A final conclusion will discuss all results presente d in the different chap ters together with an 
emphasis on further studies as how to possibly continue the work of this thesis for improved laccase production with the host 
C. cinerea (chapter 6).

Introduction 
Enzymes of importance for the wood and  the paper and pulp industries (see 
Chapter 17 of this book), in many instances, are won from fungi, either naturally 
or recombinantly produced. For natural enzyme production, fungal strains are se-
lected that are most  efficient in secretion of enzymes with required characteristics. 
Growth parameters and regulation of protein production need to be defined to 
establish the best conditions in the production processes, either in fermenters with 
a liquid medium ( submerged fermentation ,SmF ) or in solid state fermenta-
tion (SSF) on compact moist substrates or on an inert matrix (Persson et al. 1991, 
Haltrich et al. 1996, Hölker et al. 2004, Hölker & Lenz 2005). Regardless of type

Fig. 1  General flowchart of enzyme produ ction: steps in upstream-processing are 
shown in white boxes, steps of fermentation in light grey boxes, and steps in down-
stream-processing in darke r grey boxes (adapted fr om Cen & Xia 1999) 
of fermentation, the whole process is subdivided into three basic steps: i. up-
stream-processing which includes preparation of the growth substrate (most often 
in sterile form), ii. the fermentation process itself starting with inoculation of the 
production organism(s) and finishing with the harvest of the product (here en-
zymes), and iii. downstream-processing of the product that might be enriched and 
purified from the medium and production organisms and subsequently either 
recovered in a liquid or dried (Fig. 1). 
In cases where natural strains do not yield enough products, mutagenesis and 
conventional genetics with appropriate screening and selection of best strains

might help to significantly improve the production rates (Parekh et al. 2000, Adrio 
& Demain 2006, Zhang, Y.H.P. et al. 2006). For every newly developed strain, there is further opportunity to raise the titers of products by medium modifica-
tions (Lee et al. 2005, Demain 2006). As a transgenic approach, genes for enzymes 
of interest are expressed under control of highly efficient promoters in homolo-gous or in heterologous hosts, i.e., either in the species the genes came from or in a foreign species (Punt et al. 2002, Kilaru et al. 2006b). This molecular biological approach offers in addition the possibility to genetically manipulate genes in order 
to optimise the properties of their products to required needs (Cherry & Fidantsef 
2003). Such molecular approaches, however, have also their own problems. High-ly efficient promoters and an efficient gene transfer system are needed (Kilaru et 
al. 2006b), and problems in protein misfolding and aggregation, protein secretion, faulty protein modifications, and foreign product degradation have to be over-come (Gerngross 2004, Sørensen & Mortensen 2005, Wang et al. 2005, Guille-mette et al. 2007). 
In order to explain basic principles used to establish efficient enzyme produc-
tion systems, we focus in this chapter on production of fungal cellulases, xylanases 
and, more intensively, laccases as enzym es acting on lignocellulose. However, at 
places, bacterial enzymes will also be incorporated. Additional aspects on produc-tion processes and regulation of expression and product degradation are discussed by Pandey et al. (1999), Beg et al. (2001), Conesa et al. (2002), Bai et al. (2003), Mach & Zeilinger (2003), Bergquist et al. (2004), Ikehata et al. (2004), Hölker et al. (2004), Aro et al. (2005), Nevalainen et al. (2005), Polizeli et al. (2005), Schügerl 
(2005), Sukumaran et al. (2005), Wang et al. (2005), Favela-Torres et al. (2006), 
Rahardjo et al. (2006), and Viniegra-Gonzalez & Favela-Torres (2006). Several of 
these review papers concentrate also on enzymes acting in lignocellulose degra-
dation. 
Submerged fermentation (SmF) 
At the present time in Western countries, industrial production of enzymes by mi-
cro-organisms is nearly ex clusively (90%) conducted in  submerged fermentations 
in liquid media (Hölker et al. 2004). The operation of enzyme production takes 
place in a specific vessel, known as fermenter  or bioreactor , in which micro-or-
ganisms are cultured with suitable substrates under defined process parameters. In 
liquid cultures, a wide variety of fermentation systems are available that distinguish by the way of oxygen input into the liquid substrate. Three main types of fermen-ters are available (see Fig. 2A): i. stirred vessels  in which the liquid and the gase-
ous phase are mixed by stirrers, ii. loop fermenters  in which the medium is 
pumped through an external circuit, and iii. bubble columns  or airlift reactors
without movable mechanical elements in which gas is supplied from outside and where air bubbles help in mixing (Russell et al. 1974, Schügerl 1980, Crueger &

substrate on the trays (left), static column reactor or fixed-/packed-bed reactor where 
the solid substrate is retained on a perforat ed base (distributor) through which humidi-
fied air is passed through and lead into the solid substrate and an air filter to trap any 
dust and biological material evaporating with th e air flow (middle), an d fluidised bed re-
actor (right) used to force humi dified air through a distributor into the vessel at a velocity 
supporting pneumatic agitation of  the solid substrate particles. In each case, the solid 
substrate (respectively inert matrix) is indic ated by the plaid pattern. Schemes were sim-
plified from diagrams by Rodríguez Couto & Sanromán (2006b). Further explanations in

vessel, both in laboratories as well as in industrial applications (Fig. 3A).
Next to classification of bioreactors, the process itself can be categorised into 
batch ,fed-batch  and continuous cultivation . In laboratories, enzyme produc-
tion processes are usually performed in batch cultures, whereas in pilot plants and industrial applications a continuous cultivation is preferred as a complex, but more reliable and ‘cheaper’ cultivation technique. Batch and fed-batch operations are discontinuous fermentation processes where the culture together with the pro-ducts is harvested at the end of the process (Longobardi 1994). In a batch opera-tion, the volume of the medium is constant during the whole period; no additional nutrients are added. The fed-batch cultivation is similar to the batch cultivation

density in the exponential gr owth phase, the inlet and the outlet volume  flow of medium 
(indicated by the V symbols with dot) ar e levelled which allows c ontinuous cultivation 
until substrate limitation is reached but it  offers the possibility to control the sub-
strate concentration at a desired condition. Once the substrate is used up in fed-
batch cultivation, extra substrate is added at a specific volume flow until the maxi-mum working volume of the bioreactor is reached. The subsequent harvest of the product and/or the micro-organisms marks the end of the cultivation.  
Integrated bioprocessing in which a potentially inhibitory product (and also 
possible toxic by-products) is continuously removed from the fermentation broth 
as it is produced has important advantages in improving yield and conversion relative to conventional batch and fed-batch processes. In continuous production, 
product yields are enhanced by both, an absolute increased product formation and an avoidance of product decomposition (Schügerl 2000, Schügerl & Hubbuch 2005). For continuous fermentation, a steady state of the process must be achieved. At this specific cultivation stage, the substrate and biomass concen-tration is maintained constant by simultan eously draining of culture liquid (includ-
ing the product and any by-products) and entry of new substrate/medium (see Fig. 3B). Regardless of fermenter and process type used, various process parame-ters have to be controlled during fermentation, such as substrate composition, cell densities, biomass shape, oxygen concentration, temperature, pH, shear forces, and foam formation (Rani & Rao 1999, Papagianni 2004).

the systems, strategies of mathematical techniques-experimental design and opti-
misation are used to achieve best operating conditions for growth of micro-orga-nisms and product formation in order to obtain optimum yields (Kennedy & 
Krouse 1999, Rani & Rao 1999).  
Solid state fermentation (SSF) 
Solid state fermentation has a long tradition in Asian food industry, e.g. in produc-
tion of the protein-rich Koji for sake brewing from rice. The long-standing experi-
ences with SSF together with the huge human capital also influenced enzyme pro-
duction in Asia – cellulases from fungal Trichoderma  strains for example are won on 
large scale by the more work-intense SSF (Hölker & Lenz 2005). In spite of the 
better established and standardised and therefore technically easier to handle SmF, 
a new trend towards fungal cultivation and enzyme production in SSF is seen also 
in Western countries (Raimbault 1998, Hölker et al. 2004, Rodríguez Couto & 
Sanromán 2005). Fungal morphology (cellular aggregation, mycelial pellet shape, 
size, etc.) very much influences production efficiencies in SmF and is often subop-
timal in submerged culture of filamentous fungi that naturally prefer growth on 
surfaces (Papagianni 2004, Grimm et al. 2005, Kelly et al. 2006). SSF allowing the 
fungi to grow on surfaces therefore presents a more natural environment (Ooij-
kaas et al. 2000, Aguilar et al. 2004). Higher oxygen availability is guaranteed by 
surface growth and by the fact that in SSF the space between micro-organisms 
and matrix is mostly filled with gas (Durand 2003). Carbon catabolite repression (repression by fermentable sugars) of enzyme synthesis is a problem in conventio-nal SmF but not in SSF due to different nutrient and metabolite diffusion. Also due to different diffusion, stimulation by regulator molecules (inducers) is better in SSF and the product degradation is lower (Oojikaas et al. 2000, Aguilar et al. 2004, Viniegra-Gonzalez & Favela-Torres 2006). For all these and other reasons, productivity and enzyme yields in SSF can be higher than in SmF (Díaz-Godínez et al. 2001, Viniegra-González et al. 2003, Matsumoto et al. 2004, Sandhya et al. 2005, Shah & Madamwar 2005, Hongzhang et al. 2006, Patil & Dayanand 2006). Disadvantageous in SSF is, however, the lower thermal conductivity of the air space compared to the liquid enclosing micro-organisms in SmF. The better supply of oxygen in SSF therefore leads to a reduction in heat transfer and thus to problems in process up-scaling by difficulties in temperature control. In addition, in large scale application oxygen gradients will develop (Durand 2003, Hölker et 
al. 2004). SSF in general is hard to control, particularly in large plants. It is labour intensive and the contamination pressure is quite high (Cen & Xia 1999, Pandey et al. 2000). Different water absorption potentials of the distinct matrices used in SSF, mechanical stress exerted on the micro-organism in certain processes (see drum reactor in Fig. 2B), the need for a sterile or non-sterile process, general process control and up-scaling can put restraints on the reactor design (Mitchell et al. 2000, Durand 2003). In contrast, cultivation of mixed organisms is more easily

increasing absolute yields (Hölker et al. 2004; see below). 
Also in SSF, the micro-organisms are cultured in different types of fermenters 
(Fig. 2B, Table 1), on a degradable (e.g. wheat bran) or non-degradable (e.g. poly-
urethane foam) matrix. The matrix serves the micro-organisms as anchor and, in the case of a solid substrate, also as nutrient source. Substrates for SSF can be so-lid by-products of agriculture and forestry such as rice grai ns, straw, wood chips 
and various other lignocellulosic wastes (Pandey et al. 2000, Rodríguez Couto & Sanromán 2006a). Costs estimated for the production of bulk enzymes by usage of such waste materials and the low budget technology for the regulation of SSF processes favor SSF over SmF. A further environmental advantage is that less waste water is generated (Aguilar et al. 2004, Hölker et al. 2004). Weighting its ad-vantages and disadvantages (Table 1), views on whether SSF is adequate for bulk enzyme production are currently quite controversal but for special products, e.g. biopharmaceuticals, organic acids and certain enzymes, SSF might be more practi-
cal than SmF (Pandey et al. 2000). SSF is, however, not restricted to applications in productions. Instead of treating the raw materials with xylanase solutions for 
Laccases and other ligninolytic enzymes of basidiomycetes

biopulping and biobleaching (Daneault et al. 1994, Beg et al. 2001), fungal SSF can 
serve as an integral part in the process from compact lignocellulosic material to pulp and paper (Martínez-Íñigo et al. 2000, Gutíerrez et al. 2001, Helmy & El-
Meligi 2002, Kang et al. 2003, Szendefy et al. 2003, van Beek et al. 2007). In order 
to replace petrochemicals and help to solve the problems of global warming, SSF with fungi on lignocellulosic substrates has also found high interest in biorefinery as an environmentally-friendly production system for fuels, energy, and chemicals from biomass (Tengerdy & Szakacs 2003, Watanabe 2007; see Chapters 6 and 22 
of this book). Mushroom production on lignocellulosic wastes is also a form of 
SSF (see Chapter 22 of this book). 
Cellulases  
Hydrolytic enzymes cleaving Ƣ-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose are known as cel-
lulases. Three main types of cellulases are distinguished: i. endoglucanase (endo-1,4-Ƣ-glucanase, cellulase, EC 3.2.1.4), ii. exoglucanase (glucan 1,4- Ƣ-glucosidase, 
EC 3.2.1.74; cellulose 1,4- Ƣ-cellobiosidase, EC 3.2.1.91), and iii. Ƣ-glucosidase 
(cellobiase, EC 3.2.1.21). Endoglucanases cut the cellulose chain internally leaving oligosaccharides, which are cleaved by exoglucanases into cellobiose molecules 
(cellulose 1,4- Ƣ-cellobiohydrolase) or, glucose is chipped from their ends (glucan 
1,4-Ƣ-glucosidase). Ƣ-glucosidases can react on cellobiose, thereby releasing 
glucose molecules (Esterbauer et al. 1991, Lynd et al. 2002; see Chapter 17 of this 
book).  
Enzymatic systems of the various cellulolytic micro-organisms are however 
more diverse, acting variably on amorphous and crystalline cellulose – endogluca-
nase on the amorphous and exoglucanase on the micro-crystalline region of cellu-lose molecules (see Chapter 17 of this book). Synergistic effects between different 
types of cellulolytic enzymes were observed, topping in activities the sum of those of the individual enzymes (Lynd et al. 2002). In nature, cellulosic materials are processed by mixed cultures of cellulolytic organisms and in synergisms with many non-cellulolytic bacteria and fungi. The ability to decompose cellulose is widespread in bacteria in the orders Actinomycetales and Clostridiales. In fungi, it ranges from the phylum of Chytridiomycetes to the phylum of Basidiomycetes. Complex cellulase systems (known as cellulosome) bound to the cell via specific polypeptides exist in anaerobic bacteria (e.g. Bacteroides ,Clostridium ,Ruminococcus ),
non-complex systems of free extracellular enzymes in aerobic bacteria (e.g. Cellulomonas ,Thermobifida ) and also in some anaerobic bacteria (Lynd et al. 2002, 
Rabinovich et al. 2002, Zhang & Lynd 2004). Evidences for cellulosomes are found in some anaerobic rumen fungi such as Neocallimastix ,Piromyces , and Orpino-
myces species (Shoham et al. 1999, Harhangi et al. 2003, Steenbakkers et al. 2003, 
Ximenes et al. 2005) whilst aerobic fungi express mixtures of free enzymes (Lynd et al. 2002, Rabinovich et al. 2002). Bacteria and fungi are both used in batch, fed-

batch and continuous processes, either in SmF or SSF, for commercial production 
of cellulases (Bhat & Bhat 1997, Cen & Xia 1999, Tholudur et al. 1999, Sukuma-ran et al. 2005; Table 2) for applications in food and beverage industries (baking, 
malting, brewing, extraction processes), in animal feed and pharmaceutical indus-
try, in the wood and textile industry (Nevalainen 1994, Watanabe et al. 2000, Ga-lante & Formantici 2003; see Chapter 18 of this book), and potentially in ethanol production from lignocellulose (Sun & Cheng 2002, Gray 2007; see Chapter 6 of this book). According to Tolan & Foody (1999), the annual consumption of cellu-
lases in the 1990s derived from submerged cultivation comprised an amount of 
23,000 t valued $US 125 million. At the time, it represented more than 10% of the total industrial enzyme market. Nevertheless, since production costs in SSF com-pared to SmF are low ($US 0.2/kg versus $US 20/kg at the time), crude cellulase production by SSF can have economical advantages (Tengerdy 1996). 
Production of fungal cellulases  
In submerged cultures in industrial production, mainly aerobic strains of the ana-
morphic genera Trichoderma ,Humicola ,Aspergillus , and Penicillium  are used with vo-
lumes of up to a few hundred liters (Tolan & Foody 1999). Usually, mixtures of 
different enzymes are produced by the fungi (Martin et al. 2007) - an overview of 
different commercially available cellulases of Trichoderma  and Aspergillus is given by 
Laccases and other ligninolytic enzymes of basidiomycetes
55 
 M. Rühl et al. 478 
Nieves et al. (1998). In SmF, mostly complex media consisting of residual 
materials of different carbohydrazes as C-source (examples are given in Table 2) and corn steep liquor, yeast extract or peptone as N-source are used in 
combination with vitamins, various salts, and other minerals (Tholudor et al. 2001, 
Tolan & Foddy 1999, Lynd et al. 2002, Sukumaran et al. 2005; Table 2). For efficient cellulase production, fungi typically need inducers, i.e. molecules that cause an activation of promoter sequences for transcription of the genes that are controlled by these promoters. Various types of inducers of cellulase production 
have been described: disaccharides (cellobiose, sophorose, gentiobiose, lactose), as 
well as cellulose itself and its oligosaccharides, which can be degraded into soluble sugars (Tolan & Foody 1999, Aro et al. 2005, Sukumaran et al. 2005). Of the 
simple sugars, in industrial production only lactose in milk whey as a by-product of the diary industry is economically expedient as soluble inducer of cellulose ex-pression. Other comparably cheap inducers are the purified powdered cellulose Solka-Floc obtained from delignification of wood and other fibre biomass, as well as spent liquors from paper mills and sugar ind ustries containing several soluble 
and/or insoluble sugars (Tolan & Foody 1999, Lynd et al. 2002). To avoid hydro-
lysis of the natural inducers by the produced cellulases, resistant disaccharide ana-logs may be used where the oxygen in the O-glycosidic linkage is replaced by sul-
phur. However, such analogs are difficult to synthesise (Suto & Tomita 2001). 
Cellulosic material used in SmF at higher concentrations has dual functions, 
serving i. as a C-source for fungal growth, and ii. as an inducer for enzmye pro-duction. Normally in fungi, there is low level constitutive expression of cellulases 
which leads to a release of oligosaccharides from available cellulosic material. Sub-
sequently, these oligosaccharides act as inducers for higher levels of cellulase ex-
pression. Thereafter, the induced and secreted cellulases degrade any accessible 
cellulose to oligosaccharides and glucose, until larger amounts of liberated glucose 
cause catabolite repression of cellulase expression (Suto & Tomita 2001). Produc-
tion in continuous cultivation has the advantage to reduce the catabolite repres-
sion caused by accumulation of reducing sugars (Sukumaran et al. 2005).  
Because cellulases are bulk enzymes, cheap starting materials for microbial 
growth are preferred. In SS F, cheap solid cellulose-contain ing materials from agri-
culture and forestry are used as carbon source (Sukumaran et al. 2005). Cen & Xia 
(1999) list potential raw materials ranging from straw to various fibre and timber 
materials together with their carbohydrate, lignin, protein and ash contents. Due 
to the complexity, crystalline structure, and lignin content of such substrates, a 
problem in SSF is the slow colonisation of the raw materials by the micro-orga-
nisms. Only some feedstock (bran from various cereals, corn cobs, wastes from 
the pulp and paper industry) can be used directly. More complex materials need 
conditioning by diluted acids, lime, pretreatments by steam explosion or hydro-
thermal processes in order to give easier accessible substrates (Lynd et al. 2002).

 Enzyme Production 479 
Applications of fungal cellulases are various (see above and Chapter 17 of this 
book) and may require specific cellulases or mixtures of enzymes of different puri-
ties and properties. The choice of substrate(s) as well as the fungal organisms in-
fluences the mixtures of cellulases that will be produced (Lynd et al. 2002). Com-
binations of strains of different species (e.g. Trichoderma  and Aspergillus strains) may 
in some instances be preferable (Vyas & Vyas 2005, Wen et al. 2005). By recombi-nant DNA technology, it is also possible to produce individual enzymes of choice in heterologous hosts, for example in the bakers yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Cellu-
lase genes cloned for such purposes in S. cerevisiae  have their origin in bacteria, fun-
gi, and plants (Lynd et al. 2002, Saloheimo 2004). Through introduction of foreign cellulose genes, it is even possible to make the yeast growing on pure cellulose (den Haan et al. 2007). 
Xylanases
One of the main hemicelluloses in plants is xylan, a linear polymer of Ƣ-1,4-linked 
xylose, that functions in secondary cell walls as a bond between lignin and cellu-
lose (Timell 1967, Wong et al. 1988). Depending on its origin, different substitu-
ents can be attached to the xylan backbone [for a more detailed illustration, see de 
Vries & Visser (2001), Beg et al. (2001) and Chapter 17 of this book]. Two main 
types of xylanases can be distinguished (Polizeli et al. 2005): endo-1,4- Ƣ-xylanase 
(EC 3.2.1.8) and xylan 1,4- Ƣ-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37), both cleaving the Ƣ-1,4-gly-
cosidic bonds in xylan. Endo-1,4- Ƣ-xylanase thereby decreases the polymerisation 
level of the xylan backbone whereas xylan 1,4- Ƣ-xylosidase acts on smaller xylooli-
gosaccharides and xylobiose to give Ƣ-D-xylopyranosyl residues. Other xylanolytic 
enzymes are acetylesterase (EC 3.1.1.6), different types of arabinase ( ơ-N-arabino-
furanosidase, EC 3.2.1.55; arabinan endo-1,5- ơ-L-arabinosidase, EC 3.2.1.99), 
xylan ơ-1,2-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.131) and feruloyl esterase (EC 3.1.1.73) (Beg 
et al. 2001, Polizeli et al. 2005; see also Chapter 17 of this book). Xylanases have a 
range of industrial applications (removing hemicellulosic residues in animal feed, improving dough quality in bakery, improving juice extraction from fruits and 
vegetables in the food industry) but are mainly used for bleaching in the pulp and paper industry (Polizeli et al. 2005; see Chapter 17 of this book). They are as-sumed to cleave bonds between lignin and cellulose (Paice et al. 1992, reviewed by Uffen 1997, Polizeli et al. 2005) that might help to protect against cellulolytic degradation and hinders the exposure of lignin to bleaching compounds (Viikari et al. 1994, Beg et al. 2001; see Fig. 4 in Chapter 21 of this book). 
Xylanases are predominantly produced by micro-organisms (Table 3), but are 
also found in marine algae, protozoans, crustaceans, insects, snails, and seeds of land plants (Sunna & Antranikian 1997). As in the case of cellulases, microbial production of xylanases can take place in SmF and SSF (see Table 3), although about 80-90% of the commercial xylanases are gained through submerged fermen- 
Laccases and other ligninolytic enzymes of basidiomycetes

tation, usually with filamentous ascomycetes and their related anamorphic genera 
(Polizeli et al. 2005, Chávez et al. 2006 ; Table 3). Species are often the same than 
those used in cellulase production (compare examples in Tables 2 and 3). Fungi 
tend to produce mixtures of xylan-degrading enzymes, different xylanases com-
bined with accessory xylanolytic enzymes for debranching of substituted xylans (Haltrich et al. 1996, Chávez et al. 2006) that without further downstream process-ing might directly be applied in biobleaching of paper pulp (Szendefy et al. 2006). Important for this is that the enzymes are as much as possible cellulase-free (Chri-
stov et al. 1999). Also for applications in the textile industry, presence of cellulases 
is unwanted in xylanase preparations in order not to damage the celluose (Kul-karni et al. 1999, Polizeli et al. 2005). Production conditions, in particular media components, can favour which types of enzymes are obtained from the fungi and help to avoid or reduce impurities with unwanted enzymes (Haltrich et al. 1996). 
Production of fungal xylanases  
Bulk substrates used for SmF and SSF are comparable to the ones used for cellu-
lase production (Tables 2 and 3), except that in most instances cellulose is re-
placed by xylan and its sugar xylose in order to induce production of the required 
xylanases and to avoid unwanted induction of cellulase production. Various deri-
vatives of xylan (xylose, xylobiose, xylooligosaccharides, etc.) are possible inducers 
of xylanases although effects on xylanase biosynthesis vary with the species used 
for production (Kulkarni et al. 1999). In natural production of xylanase, isolated 
xylan from different lignocellulosic materials (beechwood, birchwood, larchwood, 
oat spelt) and other agricultural and forestry residues (e.g. beet pulp, corn cobs, 
wheat/rice bran, straw) are often used as inducing substrate. In SmF, the concen-
tration of the xylan substrate can be as high as 75 g/l (Haltrich et al. 1996). Mea-
sures to optimise natural xylanase production and scale up the processes are prin-
cipally the same as in cellulase production. Natural production of xylanases can be 
improved by altering culturing conditions such as concentrations of media com-
ponents (carbon, nitrogen, salts, etc.), te mperature, pH, aeration, and others. Also 
for establishing large scale xylanase productions, modern experimental design with 
statistical methodologies are used to calculate best process parameters (Katapodis 
et al. 2006, Li et al. 2006, 2007, Azin et al. 2007). In addition, mutants with better 
xylanase yields are screened for (Smith & Wood 1991, Park et al. 2002, Hao et al. 
2006).
In cases where pure enzymes are required and where by culture conditions it is 
not possible to produce pure xylanases with a filamentous fungus without cellulase 
contamination, fungal xylanase genes are expressed heterogously in Escherichia coli
and, more often, in yeasts such as Pichia pastoris  and S. cerevisiae  (Hahn-Hägerdal et 
al. 2005, Jeffries 2006, Korona et al. 2006, Berrin et al. 2007, Chen et al. 2007, Tung et al. 2007) . Expression in org anisms well established for industrial heterolo-
gous protein production has the further advantage that fermentation conditions 
Laccases and other ligninolytic enzymes of basidiomycetes

are easily adapted to xylanase production (Damaso et al. 2006). However, it is also 
possible to enhance enzyme yields in homologous and heterologous filamentous fungi by replacing the natural xylan-inducible promoter by more efficiently work-
ing promoters underlying different regulation schemes (de Faria et al. 2002, Rose 
& van Zyl 2002, Levasseur et al. 2005). Recombinant protein production has ano-ther positive consequence for applications: site-directed mutagenesis and directed evolution are used in molecular gene engineering to optimise the enzyme proper-ties (see for examples on xylanases see Xion et al. 2004, Fenel et al. 2006, Sriprang 
et al. 2006, Stephens et al. 2007). 
Laccases 
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are oxidoreductases capable of oxidising phenols as well as 
aromatic amines (Leonowicz et al. 2001; see Chapter 17 of this book). Because of 
their wide substrate range, these enzymes are attractive for various biotechnologi-
cal applications, for example in the food industry, the textile industry, the pulp and 
paper industry, in wood composite production, in soil bioremediation, and others 
(Hüttermann et al. 2001, Mai et al. 2004, Husain 2006, Kilaru 2006, Rodríguez 
Couto & Toca Herrera 2006; see also Chapters 17 and 18 of this book).  
Laccases have four copper atoms as cofactors located at the catalytic centre of 
the protein and they belong therefore to the group of multicopper oxidases. In na-ture, these enzymes are produced by many fungi and plants, but also by a few bac-teria and insects (Mayer & Staples 2002, Claus 2003, 2004, Baldrian 2006, Hoegger et al. 2006). Besides laccase from the lacquer tree Rhus vernificera  (Johnson et al. 
2003), commercially available laccases are usually of fungal origin (see Table 4), most likely from white-rot and saprophytic basidiomycetes such as Trametes ,
Pleurotus  and Agaricus  species that secrete high amounts of these enzymes (Minussi

et al. 2002, Xu 2005). Usually, commercial laccases come from SmF fermentation 
(Cherry & Fidantsef 2003; Table 4).  
Next to various basidiomycetes, many ascomycetes are also producers of inter-
esting laccases (Baldrian 2006, Kilaru 2006; Table 4). Although laccases usually 
have a wide substrate spectrum, enzymes can differ in the range of substances they attack (Kilaru 2006, Mander et al. 2006). In consequence, enzymes may be differentially suitable for specific tasks in biote chnology. Most enzymes are (best) 
active in the lower pH range (pH 2-4; Baldrian 2006, Kilaru 2006) but applications may ask for reaction optima at higher pHs in the neutral or slightly alkaline range. Other catalytic properties (e.g. a high redox potential, temperature optimum) and protein stabilities play also a role in applications. In the literature, over 100 lac-cases have been described in more or less detail at the enzymatic level. Neverthe-less, screening for new enzymes is still intensively going on in order to find enzymes better adapted to the respective biotechnological problems (Baldrian 
2006, Kilaru 2006).  
Production of native laccases in pure culture 
The most studied genus concerning laccase production is probably Trametes
covering numerous of the strong white-rot fungi. Several Trametes  species have 
been tested for their ability to produce laccases, either in submerged or in solid 
state production. Although production by SmF is best established, results show 
that SSF also has its potential in efficient laccase production (Tables 4 and 5). As 
with the other enzymes, an important factor in production is the cultivation medi-
um. Both, the sources of carbon and nitrogen as well as relative amounts of the 
nutrients play a role. In T. versicolor , cellobiose and mannitol gave better results 
than glucose (Mikiashvili et al. 2005) and carbon limitation (glucose depletion) acts 
stimulating in laccase production (Tavares et al. 2005). However, for best results

 Enzyme Production 485 
sugar concentrations have to be adjusted to reach a balance between fungal bio-
mass and enzyme production (Ryan et al. 2007). In continuous cultivation, this can be achieved by constant feeding of low glucose amounts (Galhaup et al. 
2002).
Plant waste material (e.g. mandarine peels, groundnut shells) and organic nitro-
gen sources (corn steep liquor, peptone, casein hydrolysate) perform well in culti-
vation with Trametes  and also Pleurotus  species (Dong et al. 2005, Mikiashvili et al. 
2005, 2006). Nitrogen supplementation in SSF of selected agro- and forestry- 
wastes (saw dust, oil palm frond, wheat straw, beech tree leaves) can very much 
raise enzyme yields of various white-rot fungi (D´Souza et al. 1999, Kachlishvili et 
al. 2006, Vikineswary et al. 2006). Other studies report N-limitation to be better 
for laccase production in P. ostreatus  (Hou et al. 2004) and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus
(Eggert et al. 1996). On a superficial view, results may appear to be contradictory 
(Galhaup et al. 2002). Effects of nitrogen addition depend however on both strain 
and substrate (Kachlishvili et al. 2006). Other factors also play a role. Static cul-
tures of P. ostreatus andTrametes gallica  were reported to be superior to agitated cul-
tures (Hou et al. 2004, Dong et al. 2005), whilst in Irpex lacteus  no differences were 
seen (Kasinath et al. 2003, Shin 2004), and in Funilia troggi  an agitated culture out-
performed a static one (Birhanli & Yesilada 2006). Also culture volumes have an 
influence. Transfer of established conditions from laboratory to larger scales of 
submerged culture therefore remains a problem. Fungal morphology is likely to be 
different in bioreactors of in creased size or different shape  due to altered aeration 
conditions (being of special importance in fermentations where production and 
application of the oxygen-dependent enzymes occur simultaneously such as in 
waste water treatment) and due to the shearing forces applied in the different reac-
tor types (Hess et al. 2002, Bermek et al. 2004, Ryan et al. 2005). Immobilisation 
of fungi on solid matrices is a very active research area to overcome problems 
with up-scaling in production of laccases by the various white-rot fungi. Several 
solid matrices have successfully been tested as support for laccase production by 
SSF – partially in combined procedures targeting at de gradation of toxic and recal-
citrant compounds in liquids: stainless steel sponge, nylon sponge, polyurethane 
foam and alginate beads (Rodríguez Couto et al. 1997, 2004a,b, Prasad et al. 
2005a, Domínguez et al. 2007; see Table 5 for examples) and several agricultural 
residues, like kiwi fruit wastes (Rosales et al. 2005), barley bran (Rodríguez Couto 
et al. 2002a), grape seeds and stalks (Lorenzo et al. 2002, Moldes et al. 2004), and 
corn cab (Tychanowicz et al. 2006). Optimisation in growth and laccase produc-
tion in SmF cultures is nowadays addressed by experimental design technologies 
considering variable parameters like nutrient concentration, inducers, agitation, 
pH and inoculum (Prasad et al. 2005b, Tavares et al. 2006). The pH has been 
shown to influence laccase yields e.g. in Botrytis cinerea  - at pH 3.5, 20% more lac-
case was produced than at pH 5.0 (Fortina et al. 1996). In addition, the tempera-
ture of cultivation can have an influence (Forina et al. 1996, Koroleva et al. 2002, 
Laccases and other ligninolytic enzymes of basidiomycetes
63 
 M. Rühl et al. 486 
Nyanhongo et al. 2002, Wang, J.W. et al. 2006). For example, in glucose-based 
medium, an increase from 28°C to 37°C resulted in a decrease of laccase yield in cultivation with Trametes  sp., whereas in cellobiose medium the laccase activity in 
the supernatant increased more than two times with such temperature shift (Tong 
et al. 2007). 
As with other enzymes acting in lignocellulose degradation, small amounts of 
extracellular laccases are often constitutively secreted (Bollag & Leonowicz 1984, 
Koroljova-Skorogbogat´ko et al. 1998, Scheel et al. 2000, Da Cunha et al. 2003, 
Zhang, M. et al. 2006). Higher yields however require induction of expression. Se-veral inducers have been applied to increase yields of laccase: copper, phenols, 2,5-xylidine and related compounds in T. versicolor  (Collins & Dobson 1997, Tava-
res et al. 2005, Kollmann et al. 2005, Domínguez et al. 2007, Ryan et al. 2007), ethanol in P. cinnabarinus  (Lomascolo et al. 2003, Meza et al. 2006, 2007), aromatic 
compounds including veratryl alcohol in Botryosphoraeria  sp. (Vasconcelos et al. 
2000, Dekker & Barbosa 2001), copper and phenolic compounds in Panus tigrinus
(Chernykh et al. 2005), copper, cotton stalk extract, dimethyl sulphoxide, and the 
synthetic substrate ABTS [2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothialozin-6-sulphonic acid)] inP. ostreatus  (Ardon et al. 1996, Palmieri et al. 2000, Hou et al. 2004, Shah et al. 
2006), and copper and lignin-related compounds in Pleurotus pulmonarius  (Souza et 
al. 2004, Tychanowicz et al. 2006). Complex substrates such as sugar cane bagasse and lignocellulosic material such as wood and peanut shells have also been shown to be effective in various fungi (D’Souza et al. 1999, Arora & Gill 2001, Linke et al. 2005, Makela et al. 2006). Many fungal strains produce a range of laccase isoen-
zymes, being either variations of differentially glycosylated laccases from the same 
gene or enzymes from different genes (for examples see Palmieri et al. 1997, 2000, 
2003, Dong et al. 2005, D´Souza-Ticlo et al. 2006, Linke et al. 2005, Lorenzo et al. 
2006; see Chapter 17 of this book). Induction can be selective on the different 
laccase genes as shown for example for Trametes  sp. I-62 and Pleurotus sajor-caju
(Soden & Dobson 2001, Terrón et al. 2004). 
Inducers of laccase production might be toxic (copper, 2,5-xylidine) and/or 
expensive (ABTS). Laccase has been produced with Trametes villosa  and T. versicolor
strains in the 500 l stirred vessel shown in Fig. 3A using 0.6 mM 2,5-xylidine as an 
inducer in an artificial medium I (per l: 10 g glucose, 0.5 g yeast extract, 2.5 g L-
asparagine, 0.15 g DL-phenylalane, salts; Shekholeslani 1991) developed for high 
laccase production. However, the toxic 2,5-xylidine can be replaced by kraft lignin 
(Indulin AT, Westvaco, Raleigh, USA). Yields of laccase obtained with medium I 
with the Trametes  strains are in the range of 12 U/ml (Shekholeslami 1991; 
M. Euring & A. Kharazipour, unpublished). The laccase has been used in the pro-
duction of MDF (medium density fibreboards) and particle boards in laboratory 
and technical scale at concentrations of 20 U/g raw material (dry process) and 
544 U/g (wet process) (Kharazipour 1996, Kharazipour et al. 1997; further read-
ing in Chapter 18 of this book).

Laccase production in mixed cultures 
Interactions between different fungi as well as between fungi and certain prokary-
otes can have an inducing effect on lacca se activity, often in strain-specific man-
ners (Iakovlev & Stenlid 2000, Baldrian 2004, Ferreira Gregorio et al. 2006, Chi et al. 2007, Kleeman 2007; Fig. 4). Such effects of co-cultivation might help individu-al species and microbial communities in lignin degradation but also in competition 
and defence of their habitats (Boddy 2000, Iakovlev & Stenlid 2000). Several 
white-rot and litter-degrading basidiomycetes showed higher laccase activity in cultivation with another basidiomycete species on plates and in liquid medium (Ia-
kovlev & Stenlid 2000, Baldrian 2004, Baldrian & Šnajdr 2006, Ferreira Gregorio 
et al. 2006). Increases in laccase production up to 25fold have been described (Baldrian 2004). Likewise, Trichoderma species can stimulate laccase production of 
white-rot basidiomycetes in submerged and solid state cultures (Freitag & Morrell 1992, Savoie & Mata 1999, Hatvani et al. 2002, Velázquez-Cedeño et al. 2004, Zhang, H. et al. 2006). Stimulating laccase production between white-rot fungi 
might be useful in biopulping of wood (Wang, H.L. et al. 2006, Chi et al. 2007) 
and wastewater treatment (García-Mena et al. 2005). Laccase produced to larger

terium was streaked around the fungal mycelium (black mark = growth front at the time

managed to overcome the bacterial barrier, laccase has been produced. Laccase
activity is seen by the staining of the agar through oxidation of the colourless substanceABTS converting it into a green-brown-coloured compound

amounts by mixtures of aquatic hyphomycetes can be a possible alternative in 
wastewater treatment (Junghanns et al. 2005). Whether co-cultivation of two species in SmF or SSF in bioreactors for the pure target of enzyme production 
and harvest is feasible, remains to be tested. General process management can be 
expected to be more complex under such circumstances. 
Fungal laccase gene s and their recombinant expression 
Natural fungal strains can have several different laccase genes. Five non-allelic 
genes are currently known for the white-rots T. villosa  and P. sajor-caju , four non-
allelic genes in P. ostreatus andT. versicolor , three in Lentinula edodes , P. cinnabarinus
andTrametes  sp. I-62, and, in addition, three in the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani
(Necochea et al. 2005, Hoegger et al. 2006). For very few of these, protein proper-
ties have been described (Table 6) - a reason for this might be the difficulty to 
separate the different isoenzymes coming from these genes, another that not 
enough enzyme is naturally produced from the genes by their hosts. Further to 
this, the saprophytic dung fungus Coprinopsis cinerea  (formerly Coprinus cinereus ) has 
in total seventeen different laccase genes (Kilaru et al. 2006a). In a standard nutri-
ent-rich growth medium based on yeast- and malt-extract (Granado et al. 1997), 
no or only neglectable enzyme activity was encountered in C. cinerea  cultures and 
only little, when copper was added (Fig. 5). 2,5-xylidine and veratryl alcohol were 
not effective as inducers of laccase production in this fungus (M. Navarro-Gonzá-

AmutBmut at 37°C in yeast- and malt-extract medium with and without supplementation 
of 0.1 mM CuSO 4. Laccase activity was measured as described (Kilaru et al. 2006b) 
lez, unpublished), although laccase production on protein-rich soybean-based me-
dium has been reported (Yaver et al. 1999). Yields however were not high enough 
to purify and characterise the naturally produced enzyme Lcc1 beyond determin-
ing its molecular size (Schneider et al. 1999).  
In order to obtain higher yields of individual laccases from basidiomycetes, 
several attempts have been made in the past to express selected laccase genes in 
ascomycetous yeasts ( Kluyveromyces lactis ,Pichia methanolica ,P. pastoris ,S. cerevisiae ,
Yarrowia lipolytica ) and in filamentous ascomycetes and anamorphs ( Aspergillus nidu -
lans,Aspergillus niger ,Aspergillus oryzae ,Aspergillus sojae ,T. reseei ), species that are well 
established in industrial fermentation (Table 7; for a complete literature overview 
see Kilaru 2006). However, these attempts were usually little successful since 
either no or only low enzymatic activity was obtained, stabilities of enzymes were 
low and sometimes also enzymatic properties altered (Berka et al. 1997, Sigoillot et 
al. 2004, Bulter et al. 2003, Piscitelli et al. 2005). First of all, the choice of the gene 
had an influence on the outcome of the experiments (Piscitelli et al. 2005, Kilaru 
2006, S. Kilaru et al. unpublished). Secondly, expressed proteins often had altered 
glycosylation patterns (Otterbein et al. 2000, Madzak et al. 2005, Piscitelli et al. 
2005), a post-translational protein modification that influences the protein proper-
ties. Glycosylation modes differ between different classes of eukaryotes (Brooks 
2006). Obviously, there are also fundamental differences between asco- and basi-
diomycetes. Newer efforts in recombinant laccase production therefore concen-
trate on the basidiomycetes themselves (Alves et al. 2004, Kajita et al. 2004, Kilaru 
et al. 2006b). In P. cinnabarinus , yields as high as 280 U/ml were obtained from re-

combinant enzyme pr oduction under specific culture conditions, which is nearly 
as high as the best natural production rate by a basidiomycete (Alves et al. 2004; 
compare Tables 4 and 7). In C. cinerea , enzyme yields of 3 U/ml in recombinant 
production of Lcc1 have been published (Kilaru et al. 2006b) – altering culturing 
conditions improved this in the meantime by a factor of 4 (Kilaru 2006, M. Rühl, unpublished; Table 7) into satisfactory levels (compare also Table 4). Currently it is unclear whether P. cinnabarinus is more efficient in overall laccase production 
than C. cinerea . Homologous genes were used in the expression studies with 
P. cinnabarinus  (lac1) and C. cinerea (lcc1) and the different proteins could account 
for differences in yields (see below). The promoters used are possibly of higher influence – in P. cinnabarinus with two promoters from Schizophyllum commune , addi-
tion of ethanol increased laccase produc tion by factors of more than 30. Without 
induction, yields of only 8-10 U/ml were achieved (Alves et al. 2004). A most recent study showed dual effects of ethanol on laccase production in P. 
cinnabarinus : increase of laccase gene transcription and inhibition of protease 
activities (Meza et al. 2007). Addition of ethanol to cultures of C. cinerea
transformants unfortunately had no effect on laccase yields (Kilaru et al. 2006b).

Fig. 6. Transformation of laccase genes in  Coprinopsis cinerea .A. Transformation vec-
tor of the series pYSKx with a basidiomycete laccase gene lcc under control of the 
heterologous Agaricus bisporus gpdII  promoter. pab1  encodes para-aminobenzoic acid 
synthase and acts as a marker gene for selection in C. cinerea pab1  auxotrophs. oriEc
is the start point (origin) of DNA replication in Escherichia coli ,ampr a selection marker 
gene that mediates ampicillin resistance in E. coli , and f1 an E.coli  phage replication 
origin useful for single-strand DNA synthesis. 2µm ori is a rep lication origin for the yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and ura3 a selection marker gene for orotidine 5'-phosphate 
decarboxylase that complements certain uracil auxtrophs of  yeasts. Bacterial and yeast 
sequences in this vector are requ ired for gene clonin g purposes (furt her details in Kilaru 
et al. 2006b,c). B. Once a vector with a subcloned laccase gene (here pYSK7 with gene 
lcc1 behind  gpdII promoter) has been transformed into C. cinerea , positive transfor-
mants secrete functional laccase into the medium about 4 to  5 days later. ABTS added 
to the medium will be converted into a greenish stain, marking the positive clones by 
large halos that form  around the colonies (larg er dark spots in the photo). Note in the 
photo, transformed clones are just starting to  grow. Transformants failing to produce 
laccase are seen only as small spots of pin-head size without halo 
In contrast to P. cinnabarinus  (Alves et al. 2004), C. cinerea  is a readily transform-
able basidiomycete (Binninger et al. 1987, Granado et al. 1997) and therefore re-
presents by this property an excellent choice as a host for overexpression of 
individual laccases, both from own genes as well as from genes of other species 
(Kilaru et al. 2006b,c, Grimrath 2007). Screening for suitable transformants is fast 
(Fig. 6) and the large numbers of transformants obtained from a single transfor-
mation experiment eases to find the best producers (Kilaru et al. 2006b). In the 
future, this should allow to easily analyse tailored enzymes with optimised proper-
ties produced either by targeted or by random mutagenesis. Currently, such muta-
genesis screening is performed in the suboptimal host S. cerevisiae  (Bulter et al. 
2003, Alcalde et al. 2005, 2006, Madzak et al. 2006).

The C. cinerea  laccase expression system 
C. cinerea  strain FA2222 is a strain with no laccase activity (Kilaru et al. 2006b) and 
has therefore been chosen as a producti on strain of individual enzymes. For 
efficient protein production, different promoters were tested in combination with 
C. cinerea  laccase gene lcc1 (Fig. 6A). The heterologous Agaricus bisporus gpdII  pro-
moter from a constitutively expressed glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
gene (Kilaru & Kües 2005) was found to give highest enzyme activity (Kilaru et al. 2006b; Fig. 6). Transformed DNA integrates randomly into the genome (Granado et al. 1997). In consequence, transformants differ in quality since flanking DNA 
sequences can influence expression levels of inserted genes. Screening of a higher number of transformants is thus advisable. However, the coloured halos formed around colonies on AB TS-supplemented agar when expressing laccase (Fig. 6B) is 
an excellent pre-selection for high producers (Kilaru et al. 2006b). As expected, 
glycosylation of recombinantly produced protein Lcc1 was indistinguishable from 
the protein when produced in C. cinerea  from its natural promoter (P.J. Hoegger 
unpublished).  
Also the other 16 laccase genes of C. cinerea  were transformed under the con-
trol of the A. bisporus gpdII  promoter and at least five of these can give an active 
protein in C. cinerea  but at different yields (Kilaru 2006). As far as yet known from 
protein analysis, the C. cinerea  laccases differ in substrate spectrum and other 
enzymatic properties – enzymes with a pH optimum around pH 7.0 are of special 
interest (Saathoff 2005, Kilaru 2006, M. Rühl et al. unpublished). Ongoing work has proven that also laccase genes from foreign species can be expressed in 
C. cinerea  (Grimrath 2007, P.J. Hoegger et al. unpublished). Since principally 
working, a research focus now aims on establishing best production conditions for 
transformants in fermenters (M. Rühl, unpublished).
Conclusions
More and more, fungal enzymes find applications in environment-friendly techno-
logies in modern pulp and paper and wood industries as well as in ethanol produc-
tion from lignocellulosic residues (Hüttermann et al. 2001, Kenealy & Jeffries 
2003, Tengerdy & Szakacs 2003, Mai et al. 2004, Gray 2007, Jeffries 2006; see also 
Chapter 18 of this book). To make such processes economical, high quality en-
zymes in sufficient amounts at reasonable prices are required. Cellulases, xylana-ses, laccases, and other enzymes from different organisms and with different pro-
perties are commercially available, in some instances purified, more often only 
partially purified or crude and, therefore, they are possibly mixed with other en-
zymes and proteins. Often, the non-purified enzymes are sufficient for applica-
tions, as for example in wood composite production and in pulp bleaching. Active 
research in enzyme screening, optimising fermentation (SmF and SSF) and recom-
binant production is nevertheless ongoing to provide larger catalogues of easily 
produced enzymes with new and optimal properties as required for the various

industrial applications. Currently, lignocellulose attacking enzymes are produced 
predominantly by SmF, often with wild type or mutant strains of natural enzyme 
producers, sometimes with recombinant strains. SSF processes, well established in 
Eastern cultures, now also receive higher attention in Western countries. SSF can 
be a particular good choice for enzyme production with fungi growing on solid lignocellulosic waste. Other promising yet not fully implemented approaches are those where different organisms are coupled in production and approaches where enzyme production and utilisation is combined. Establishing well-working recom-
binant production systems has the advantage that enzymes naturally produced in 
low amounts should become available at larger quantities. Moreover for recombi-nant production, enzyme properties might be optimised through genetic engineer-ing. Using one or a few organisms in recombinant productions should further-
more eliminate the elaborative work to establish for every new natural producer and each of its interesting enzymes an own fermentation process.

Abstract
Two commercial Pleurotus ostreatus
strains (030 and K12) were cultivated under
industrial conditions on wheat straw blocks 17-18 kg in weight. Within 10 weeks of cultivation,
three flushes of fruiting body production were
obtained with total yields of 4.2 and 4.1 kgmushrooms/substrate block and a biologicalefficiency (BE = total yield of fresh mushrooms
per dry weight of substrate) of about 95%,
respectively. Ligninolytic activities were followedup within the substrate over the cultivation periods.Laccase, manganese peroxidase (MnP) and
versatile (manganese-independent) peroxidase
(VP) activities were high in vegetative growth
phases within the substrate and dropped upon
initiation of fruiting body formation to be hardly
detectable at the harvest of the mature
mushrooms. Directly after harvest at all observedflushes, there was a sharp increase in all threeenzymatic activities in the substrate for both
strains (maximum activities for laccase
1.1-1.3 U/ml, for MnP 15-16 U/ml and for VP1.1-1.4 U/ml). Enzymes can be extracted bypressing the spent mushroom substrates (SMS).
Potential applications for the press juice or the
enzymes in the SMS are discussed.

fermentation (SSF)Introduction
Worldwide, with constantly increasing
production rates, Pleurotus  species are currently
the second most produced edible mushrooms (1,
2). Alone in China, the annual production in 2003was about 2.5 million t (3). Pleurotus ostreatus
(Jacq.) P. Kumm. 1871, known as hiratake inJapan and as oyster mushroom in Western
countries, is a saprophytic white-rot
basidiomycete growing in forests on hardwoods
and less often on softwoods (4). For commercialproduction of the fruiting bodies, mainly straw
from wheat (Western countries) and rice (Asia)
is used as cheap basic substrate, but saw dust andwood chips and other agricultural wastes may
also be used (5). To facilitate growth on such
lignocellulosic substrates, white rot-fungi secretedifferent types of oxidative enzymes for lignin
degradation (6, 7). P . ostreatus  produces different
types of peroxidases (MnP: manganese
dependent peroxidase and VP: versatile
peroxidase; synonym: manganese-independent
peroxidase MiP) as well as laccases (8, 9).
Ligninolytic enzymes have also repeatedly
been linked to fruiting body production in higher
basidiomycetes but species appear to differ at
timings of high enzyme production and there isno clear-cut picture on functional relevance of
the enzymes in fruiting (1, 10). From small scale
experiments in P . ostreatus , it has previously been
reported that production of ligninolytic enzymes
increases with vegetative biomass production on
Laccases and other ligninolytic enzymes of basidiomycetes

 479
solid growth substrates and that it drops during
the sexual fruiting stage (11 - 13). Here, wepresent a study on the ligninolytic activities of
two commercial P. ostreatus  strains during
substrate colonisation and over three flushes of
fruiting body production under industrial
conditions. High yields of laccases and
peroxidases were detected in the substrate blocksshortly after mushroom harvests offering the
possibility to harvest from spent mushroom
substrate (SMS) enzymes for biotechnological
applications as an extra benefit from mushroom
cultivation.
Methods
Cultivation of Pleurotus ostreatus  on solid
substrate
Industrial produced pasteurised wheat-
straw-based substrate originally prepared and
inoculated with a fungus by Substratbetriejf Horst
(Horst, Netherlands) was provided by the
commercial mushroom grower druid
Austernpilze (Immichenhain, Germany). Twodifferent production strains of P . ostreatus  were
used, 030 (Le Champignon, Loches, France) and
K12 (Sylvan Inc., Horst, Netherlands).Commercial substrate blocks (50 x 40 x 17 cm
3,
around 17-18 kg each) wrapped in plastic foil
were placed in a mushroom cultivation chamber.
During vegetative growth or for
regenerative growth after mushroom harvest of
the first flush, the temperature in the chamber
was kept at 20-25 °C and the relative humidity
(RH) at 90-95%. Once fruiting body primordia
(sized 1 to 2 mm in Ø) became visible for the
naked eye, the temperature was lowered to 16 to18 °C and RH was increased to 95-98% as done
in commercial mushroom production to improve
fruiting body development and quality of themushrooms (5). The lower temperature was hold
up to the harvest of the mature mushrooms. Upon
the first flush, the temperature was again raisedfor regenerative growth but not upon the second
flush. The actual temperature setting throughout
the cultivation was influenced by internal
substrate conditions. During the whole cultivation
periods, the internal temperature of substrate
blocks was measured. The internal values werekept around 20 °C (20-21 ± 1 °C) in vegetative
growth phases and around 19 °C (19 ± 2 °C) in
mushroom production phases. Deviations from
these internal values were compensated by
smaller adjustments in temperature in thecultivation chambers (± 5 °C during mycelial
growth phases, ± 2 °C during mushroom
production phases). The moisture content of the
substrate blocks was also controlled throughout
the length of the cultivation period and found tobe relatively constant (76 to 78%) at a level as
wanted for mushroom cultivation (14).
Determination of mushroom yields
Fruiting bodies were harvested at
maturation and weighted. Total mushroom yields
were calculated as biological efficiency (BE) in
percentage of the weight of fresh fruiting bodies
per weight of dried substrate (5, 15).
Enzyme detection in the substrate
Every second day from day 21 after
inoculation onwards when the substrate was fully
colonised, samples of about 50 g (± 10 g)
throughout colonised substrate were taken by
cutting approximately 4 x 4 x 2 cm3 sized cuboids
from the substrate blocks. The samples with the
submerged mycelium were weighted and
subsequently squeezed by a self-made hand press
(contact surface 25 x 30 cm2) in order to extract
all free liquid from the substrate. The residual
substrate was dried at 80 °C for 48 h and the
substrate moisture content was calculated from
subtracting the dry weight (gram dried substrate
[gds]) from the wet weight at sample harvest.
The liquids pressed from substrate samples
were collected and measured in volume and theirCurrent Trends in Biotechnology and Pharmacy, V ol. 2 (4) 478 -492 (2008)

pHs were determined. Upon centrifugation in
order to eliminate any smaller solid parts fromthe liquids, aliquots were taken for enzyme
measurements. Laccase activity was determined
in 120 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.6) withABTS (2,2‘-azino-bis [3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-
sulfonate]) as a substrate and the oxidation was
determined at 420 nm according to Matsumuraet al.(16). Laccase activities were calculated using
an extinction coefficient of ε
420 = 36000 M-1cm-1
(17). Peroxidase activities were analysed by
oxidation of phenol red under presence and
absence of Mn2+ for determining MnP and VP
activities, respectively, according to the protocol
of Kuwahara et al. (18).  Peroxidase activities
were calculated using an extinction coefficient
of ε610 = 4460 M-1 cm-1 (19). Enzyme activities
are given in units (U) defined as the amount of
ABTS, respectively phenol red in µmol
transformed per min.
Results
Laccase and mushroom production
alternate during cultivation of P . ostreatus
030
In a first experiment, laccase activities were
followed up within three commercial substrate
blocks inoculated with P . ostreatus  strain 030.
Once the first primordia were observed (day 4
after fully colonising the substrate blocks), the
temperature was set at 16-18 °C and RH to 95-98%. In all three substrate blocks, laccase
activities were comparably low during
subsequent primordia and fruiting body
development (approximately 0.3-0.5 U/ml press
juice) and at harvest of the mature fruiting bodies(approximately 0.1-0.2 U/ml press juice). 3.0 ±
0.4 kg mushrooms per substrate block were
collected at the first flush lasting four days. The
day after harvest, there was a sudden increase in
enzyme activity with an average laccase activity
of 0.6 U/ml press juice. For regenerative mycelial
growth, two days later the temperature forcultivation was raised to 20-25 °C and there was
a further increase in laccase activity to about 1.5U/ml hold in this range over the following seven
days. Afterwards, laccase activities in the
substrate blocks gradually dropped to about 0.8U/ml press juice for the next seven days. At this
point, primordia of the second flush became
visible and the temperature was lowered to18°C. Laccase activities declined further in the
next days of incubation. Mature fruiting bodies
of the second, slightly prolonged flush were first
harvested after one week (2.0 ± 0.7 kg
mushrooms per substrate block; 125% BE in totalcalculated from the yields of the first and the
second flush) when laccase activities were barely
detectable. During the three subsequent days offlush of the second harvest, there was again a
dramatic increase in laccase activity to about 0.8
U/ml at day 3 of harvest (last day of harvest) andabout 1.4 U/ml press juice two days later. The
observations suggested an inverted correlation
between laccase activity and fruiting bodymaturation with the minimum of activity
occurring when the mushrooms were mature.
Mushroom production in a large scale
experiment with two different P . ostreatus
strains
To follow this observation up in more detail,
commercial wheat straw blocks inoculated with
either P . ostreatus  030 or with P . ostreatus  K12
were incubated in a cultivation chamber under
conditions of industrial mushroom production.
Per strain, six substrate blocks were analysed.
All substrate blocks were completely colonised21 days after inoculation (Fig. 1A). After threefurther days, when small primordia appeared(Fig. 1B), the temperature was lowered for
fruiting body production (Fig. 1C) until
mushrooms were harvested (Fig. 1D) upon whichthe temperature was raised for regenerativegrowth (Fig. 1E). Two further flushes of

 Ligninolytic enzymes in the large scale
experiment
The water content of the substrate blocks
was relatively constant over the whole cultivation
periods with values between 76% and 78% andthe pH of the press juice from the substrate wasstable at pH 5.0 ± 0.2, regardless of theP . ostreatus  strain used. Activities of three types
of enzymes (laccase, MnP, VP) were measuredin eluates obtained from pressing representative
samples of the substrate blocks. The activity of
all the ligninolytic enzymes showed a periodical
alteration with mushroom production (Fig. 2 and
Fig. 3). For both strains, activities of all threeenzymes gradually declined with progress of
vegetative growth and primordia production to
be lowest at the point of mushroom harvest. Also
for both strains, there was a sharp increase in
activities of all three enzymes shortly after each
mushroom harvest. Over the time, the activitiescurves of all three enzymes in both strains
followed similar patterns with maxima and
minima occurring at comparable periods.
However, highest laccase activities of 1.4 U
and 1.1 U per ml press juice (5.45 U/gds and
4.30 U/gds) and 0.9 U and 1.1 U per ml press
juice (3.55 U/gds and 3.88 U/gds) were reachedfor P . ostreatus  strains 030 and K12, respectively,
prior and after the first flush at vegetative growth
phases where primordia were not yet formed. At
mushroom harvests, laccase activities in the
substrate were in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 U/ml
(Fig. 2B, Fig. 3B). Maximum MnP and VP
activities were observed shortly after the second
and the third flush in regenerative phases prior
to primordia formation. MnP activities were
always about 10 times higher than VP activities
(compare Fig. 2C and D, Fig. 3C and D).
Maximum MnP activities were 15.0 U/ml and
16.0 U/ml (50.63 U/gds and 55.31 U/gds)
(Fig. 2C, Fig. 3C), and maximum VP activities
1.9 U/ml and 1.5 U/ml (5.91 U/gds and5.58 U/gds) for strains 030 and K12, respectively
(Fig. 2D, Fig. 3D). At times of harvest, when all
enzyme activities were lowest, minimum valuesbetween 0.0 U/ml to 4.5 U/ml were measured
for MnP activities (Fig. 2C, Fig. 3C) and minimum
values between 0.0 U/ml to 0.3 U/ml for VPactivities (Fig. 2D, Fig 3D), respectively. Parallel
to the prolonged harvest time of the second flush
(Fig. 2A, Fig. 3A), the period of low levelenzymatic activities in the substrate was longer
at the second flush than at the first flush (Fig.
2B-C, Fig. 3B-D). Since temperature shifts482

the three flushes occured synchronised in weeks5, 8 and 10 of cultivation with only slight time
shifts between P . ostreatus  strain 030 and K12
(Fig. 2A and Fig. 3A). Mushroom yields declined
with the three flushes from 2.2 kg to 0.5 kg per
substrate block (Table 1). Whilst the first flushwas confined in both strains to one day, the second
flush was spread over a few days and the third
flush with one day was short (Fig. 2A, Fig. 3A)with little yield (Table 1). The total mushroomyield (in average 4.1 and 4.2 kg per substrateblock) and the total BE (95%) did not differsignificantly between the two strains              (Table
1).

 applied in the culturing regime were always done
after a drastic change in enzyme activities,
respectively not done after the second flush (Fig.
2A, Fig. 3A), we can conclude that changes inenzymatic activities were influenced by the
internal physiological conditions of the fungus
related to synchronisation within the mycelium
of fruiting and non-fruiting periods. Some
influence on the absolute level of enzymatic
activities by the temperature of the air cannot beexcluded but substrate temperature, moisture and
pH did not differ significantly by the different
settings of environmental conditions in theclimate chamber (see above). The microclimate
within the substrate might be expected to be more
decisive for the enzymatic activities of thesubmerged mycelium. However, communication
with the surface mycelium and the developing
fruiting structures must exist in order to regulateenzymatic activities in the submerged mycelium
appropriately up or down as required in the cycle
of vegetative mycelial growth and sexual
reproduction.
Discussion
Various types of oxidative enzymes are
produced by white rot fungi in order to make use
of lignocellulosic substrates for nutrition (6, 7). In
this study, we found commercial P . ostreatus
strains to produce laccase, MnP and VP in solid
state fermentation on wheat straw as describedpreviously for the species in the literature (12, 20,21). Under conditions of industrial mushroom
cultivation using 17-18 kg blocks of wheat straw,
enzyme activities in the substrate blocksalternated with periods of mushroom production(Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Mata et al. (11) and Elisashvili et
al. (13) reported a similar diametrical behaviour
in enzymatic activities (laccase and MnP) and
fruiting body production when strains were
cultivated on other lignocellulosic substrates
(sugarcane bagasse, tree leaves). Mata et al. (11)
tested however only the first flush on 0.5 kgblocks with sugar cane bagasse as substrate and
Elisashvili et al. (13) apparently also but on 2 kg
substrate blocks of either tree leaves or wheat
straw. In our study, we followed up the enzymatic
behaviour in the substrate over three flushes on
large industrial substrate blocks. As in mushroomindustry (5), we obtained two flushes with
reasonable yields whilst the output of the third
flush dropped to a third of the yield of the second
flush (Table 1). In industrial production, a third
flush is usually not waited for since the earningsexpected from a third flush do not outweigh the
costs of the prolonged cultivation under a
controlled temperature and humidity regime (5).
Our total yields in both series of experiments were
comparable to standard yields in commercialproduction (5).
The diametrical cycling pattern of
enzymatic activities in the substrate and fruitingbody production suggests a clear physiological
distinction within cultures of P . ostreatus between
phases of vegetative growth and phases of sexual
reproduction. Lignocellolytic enzymes appear in
P . ostreatus  to be produced for regenerative
vegetative hyphal growth but not for fruiting bodydevelopment. Similarly, high enzymatic activitieswere observed in lignocellulosic substrates
during growth phases in the white-rotting
basidiomycetes Lentinus tigrinus [laccase and
peroxidase (22)], Lentinula edodes  [laccase and
peroxidase (23)] and Grifola frondosa  [laccase
(24)] with drastic reductions in enzyme activitiesduring the period of fruiting body formation. For
these species, it is very likely that the enzymes
are produced for lignocellulosic substratedegradation in order to provide nutrients for the
growing organism. In contrast, in cultures of the
compost fungus Agaricus bisporus , laccase and
peroxidase activities increase in the substrate
from vegetative growth to early stages of fruiting
body development and drop strongly duringfruiting body maturation (25, 26). Furthermore,
laccase activities increase greatly in substrates 484 Ligninolytic enzyme activities

after vegetative growth at fruiting body initiation
of cultures of the straw fungus Volvariella
volvacea  and they stay at high level until the
fruiting bodies matured (27). If not also for
nutritional reasons produced under an alternativeregulation regime, enzyme production might be
oxidative stress-related (28, 29) and/or the
enzymes might have functions in fruiting bodymorphogenesis and pigmentation (1, 10, 27). The
discussion on biological functions of laccases and
peroxidases in relation to fruiting body
development of basidiomycetes remains still
controversial (1, 10).
The anti-cyclic pattern of enzyme
production and fruiting body development as
observed in our study for P . ostreatus  is however
of a potential biotechnological interest. Industrial
enzymes from fungi are mostly produced in
bioreactors in liquid cultures but production by
solid state fermentation (SSF) finds increasingattention (30-32). P . ostreatus  has been tested in
SSF with wheat straw, canola meal, sawdustbased SMS, grapewine sawdust, sugarcanebagasse and tree leaves as substrates in
production of phenol oxidases and/or also
cellulases (9,11,13,33-37). In small scaleproduction [using either 16 g substrate with
grapevine sawdust (9), 500 g bagasse substrate
(11), 10 g dry canola meal (35), or 16 g substrateof tree leaves (37)], yields between 0.12-32.2
U/gds and 18.0 U/gds were reported for laccases
and yields between 0.37-6.9 U/gds and 1820U/gds for MnP although values might not all be
directly comparable due to the use of different
substrates (Table 2). Only Stajic et al. (9) reportedalso VP activities (measured with DMP = 2,6-
dimethoxyphenol). With values between 2.2 U/l
to 38 U/l (0.03 – 0.58 U/gds), the VP activitieswere around 10% of the measured MnP activities.
In our studies, with the drastic increase in
enzymatic activities two to four days aftermushroom harvests, we obtained enzymatic
yields of up to 2.9 U/gds for laccase, 45 U/gdsfor MnP and 5.9 U/gds VP. Compared to the other
studies where the same substrates were used asin our study (ABTS, phenol red, Table 2), our
enzyme yields are thus evenly good or even
better.
Trials of obtaining the free liquid from
whole industrial wheat straw substrate blocks
with a larger hydraulic press resulted in volumes
of about 5-6 l (not shown). Taken at optimum
enzymatic activities within the substrate, this
volume of press juice should then contain acalculated total amount of about 5.5-6.6 kU of
laccase, of about 75-80 kU of MnP and of
7.5-11.4 kU of VP. The raw liquid has however abrown colour, likely caused by a high content of
phenolic compounds. Unfortunately,
concentrating the enzyme activities byammonium precipitation did not result in
purification of the enzymes from these
compounds since they co-precipitated (notshown). Potential applications for the raw enzyme
solutions or of concentrated solutions are
therefore restricted to processes where a browncoloration does not matter or were presence of
extra phenolic compounds might even be of
advantage. An example for such case can be theproduction of wood and paper composites by a
two-component system in which the glue consists
of ligninolytic enzymes (usually laccase) andphenolic compounds (e.g. lignosulphonate)
[reviewed by (38, 39)]. Matcham and Wood (40),
Singh et al. (34) and Ko et al. (36) publishedpreviously protocols as how to wash out enzymes
with tap water and various buffers from SMS of
various types of mushrooms ( A. bisporus ,
Flammulina velutipes , Hericium erinaceum , L.
edodes , P . ostreatus ). However, procedures were
only tested on small scale such as 100 ml and itremains to be shown whether these procedures
will be economic enough for obtaining larger
volumes of purified enzymes needed for othercommercial applications such as in the food and
in the pharmacy industries (41, 42).Rühl et al

Alternatives for beneficial usage of the high
enzymatic levels within substrates shortly after
mushroom harvest are to apply the SMS or the
enzymatic crude extract of SMS in bioremediation
of contaminated soils and water. The used upthe spent substrate or the crude extract might bemixed with the soil or the water for promoting
the degradation of phenolic and non-phenolic
aromatic pollutants (43 - 50). For mushroomgrowers, it might therefore be useful to wait afew days after the final mushroom harvest before
disposal of the SMS in order to recycle it in a
best possible way at a stage of high enzymaticactivities. Currently, schemes for a broad re-useof the mushroom cultivation residues have beenestablished only in China which produces more
than 4 million tons of SMS per year (51). In other
countries, SMS is still considered as waste butrecent changes in legislation in favour of
ecological-friendly SMS disposal altered this view
in a number of European countries. In a topical
review on alternative uses of SMS, Oei et al.
judge the extraction of specific proteins as oneof the most beneficial potential applications of
SMS (52).

  Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
105 I. Introduction: Fermentation of basidiomycetes in liquid cultures 
Filamentous fungi, to which many of the basidi omycetes belong, can gr ow in liquid culture 
either in a free form of loose mycelial hyphae  or in an aggregated form, called mycelial 
aggregates or mycelial pellets (Braun and Vecht-Lifshitz 1991, Paul and Thomas 1998, Cui et 
al. 1998). Normally, on the laboratory scale, fl asks are used for the liquid cultivation of fungi 
either as standing or shaken cultures. On the technical and industrial scale, the 
microorganisms are grown in vessels called bioreactors (fermenters) which can differ in their mode of mixing. Accordingly, they are referred to as stirring fermenters, airlift reactors or 
bubble columns (section 2.I). The advantage of the agitated systems over the standing culture is the higher aeration rate and, theref ore, better availability of  oxygen. In standing 
cultures, mycelial mats do form at the upper su rface of the liquid medium due to a lack of 
mixing, which would bring the mycelium into the liquid. In comparison, in agitated cultures 
different mycelial forms can occur. Several factors have an influence on the type of growth in 
the agitated cultures, such as strain, growth  rate, inoculum size, cell-wall composition, 
nutrition, C/N-ratio, Ca
2+ concentrations, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, solid particles 
inside the culture broth, fermentation time, surface-active agents, aeration, agitation or 
stirring speed, respectively shear forces, biorea ctor construction and parameters related to 
the fermenter design, such as foaming (Braun and Vecht-Lifshitz 1991, Cui et al. 1998, Papagianni 2004, Fazenda et al. 2008).  Some factors such as inoculum, oxygen, ve ssel and impeller type, as well as modes of 
cultivation will be discussed in the following regarding their effect on fungal biomass, the morphology of the cultivated fungi and yields of different metabolic products (enzymes, acids).  Generally, the production of secondary metabolites (i.e. citric acid, antibiotics) and recombinant production of proteins (i.e. gluc oamylase, human interleukin 6) is of great 
interest. Liquid cultivation studies on fungi concentrate on ascomycetes capable of high 
product yields for natural production of secondary metabolites and recombinant proteins (Radzio and Kück 1997, Punt et  al. 2002, Papagianni 2004, Grimm et al. 2005). Thus, most 
of the research on fungal morphology was done for filamentous ascomycetes, such as 
Aspergillus  and Penicillium  species either in liquid cultivatio n in a laboratory scale in shake 
flask cultures or in a more technical scale in fermenters (Vanhoutte et al. 1995, Cui et al. 1997, Agger et al. 1998, McIntyre et al. 2001,  Kelly et al. 2006, Lecault et al. 2007). 
 Chapter 3 
 106 Due to the low growth rates and their spec ial requirements for liquid cultivation, 
basidiomycetes are rarely described in the literature in terms of morphology in liquid 
cultures. Nevertheless, also basidiomycetes are applied in liquid cultures for production of 
glucans, peroxidases or laccases (Fåhraeus and Reinhammar 1967, Fenice et al. 2003, Boh 
and Berovic 2007, chapter 1, section 2.I). Pr o d u c t i o n  o f  n a t i v e  l a c c a s e s  b y  d i f f e r e n t  
basidiomycetes was already listed in this work (Table 4 in section 2.I), but more information 
on parameters in liquid fermentation in bioreactors is given below (Table 1). Herein, the 
probably most important parameters on fungal morphology are the stirring speed of the impeller in the stirred vessel re actor, the aeration amount, the pH of the medium and the 
cultivation temperature (Braun and Vecht-Lifshitz 1991, Cui et al. 1997, Papagianni 2004, 
Fazenda et al. 2008).

 Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 107Generally, shake flask cultures are used for opti misation of culture conditions, such as media 
composition, cultivation temperature and pH, prior to technical scale cultivation. The 
information given in the available literature refere nces only on pellet size s and, so far, effects 
by the morphology of the fungi were in the st udies mostly neglected (Gehrig et al. 1998, 
Fang and Zhong 2002, Žmak et al. 2006).   
 An area in which basidiomycetes play an important role is the solid-state fermentation (SSF). Most basidiomycetes possess a complex en zymatic system for the degradation of 
lignocellulosic waste materials which may serve as solid substrates (section 2.II). Therefore, 
SSF provides filamentous organisms with a mo re natural growth environment and higher 
oxygen availability (for advantages and disadvantages of SSF see section 2.I). With regard to recombinant protein production, liquid cultivation might be more favourable due to a more easy process of protein purification compared  to SSF with lignocellulosic materials, where 
phenolic substances and other degradation products contaminate the culture broth (section 2.II).  This chapter intends to give a literature overview  on liquid cultivation of basidiomycete fungi 
regarding laccase production in bioreactors (Table 1), morphological structures of the 
mycelium and parameters affecting the filamentous structure.  
 
A. Important parameters of fermentation on fungal morphology and on 
production y
ields of enzy mes and other metabolites 
1. Inoculum 
Cultivation of any microorganism starts with an inoculum. The type and amount of this 
inoculum for liquid cultures can vary, especi ally when filamentous organisms growing in 
multicellular hyphal forms are used. Submer ged cultures of filamentous fungi can be 
inoculated with spores if available (Vecht-Lifshitz et al. 1990, Tucker and Thomas 1992) or 
with mycelium, which might be available in loose filamentous (Tavares et al. 2005) or 
pelleted form (Carmichael and Pickard 1989, Th iruchelvam and Ramsay 2007). These forms, 
normally derived from a pre-culture, can be used directly without homogenisation or after smashing the mycelial agglomerates into smaller fragments. When spores are used, the inoculum level depends on the spore stock prep aration, germination of the spores (time and 
viability) and altering conditions influencing the germination of the spores, like medium, pH 
and aeration (Tucker and Thomas 1992, Paul et al. 1993).  Chapter 3 
 108  
Advantages of spore inoculi are the countability of the in oculum and, therefore, the 
reproducibility. On the other hand, the lag phase is longer in cultures where spores are used 
and a higher contamination danger exists. As most basidiomycetes do not produce asexual 
spores, filamentous inoculi are usually used . Exceptions, where asexual spores from 
basidiomycetes were used in liquid cultivation, are Coprinopsis cinerea  (this study), 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Leisola et al. 1985, Jiménez-Tobon et al. 2003, Žmak et al. 
2006) and Punctularia atropurpurascens  (Böker 1990). 
 
2. Oxygen 
Oxygen is a limiting factor for growth. When the fungus grows in a pelleted form, a 
reduction of O 2 inside the pellet can occur which leads to oxygen starvation and, therefore, 
to cell death and lower yields of enzymes or other metabolites (Michel et al. 1992). To 
balance this problem, a reduction of the pellet  size or an increase of oxygen concentration 
can be applied. The latter one can be achieved when using pure oxygen instead of compressed air. Kirk et al. (1978) obtained higher lignin degradation activity on synthetic 
14C-lignin at 100% oxygen saturation compared to air saturation (21% O 2) in liquid 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  cultures in basal medium (def ined medium with glucose as a 
C-course). Similar observations were made by Dosoretz et al. (1990) who reported an 
increase in ligninolytic enzyme yield in submerged P. chrysosporium  cultures when aerating 
with pure oxygen. However, there was a concomitant higher proteolytic activity and, in consequence, a faster degradation rate of the ligninolytic activity. In their oxygenated cultures, Dosoretz et al. (1990) observed that the 
P. chrysosporium  pellets had a dark colour 
and a smoother surface compared to the pelle ts from cultures with “normal” aeration 
showing hairy-white pellets. To clarify the factor for higher ligninolytic enzyme yields in oxygenated cultures of 
P. chrysosporium , Michel et al. (1990) determined the oxygen 
concentration within fungal pellets. The author s used pellets derived from liquid shaken 
cultures, which were flushed daily with pure oxygen. The obtained data were used for 
generating a mathematic model, which allowed predictions of respirat ion kinetics in liquid 
cultures on the basis of pellet size and oxygen concentration inside the medium. The authors stated by applying their model on different studies with 
P. chrysosporium  that oxygen 
limitations inside P. chrysosporium  pellets can be compensated when using pure oxygen.

 110 In Pleurotus ostreatus  shake flask cultures, additional oxygen supply had an impact on pellet 
size (Ha et al. 2001). A shift in aeration at day 5 of cultivation from compressed air to pure 
oxygen resulted in a pellet size of 1-2 mm and laccase activities of 5 U/ml. In contrast, in 
aeration experiments with pure oxygen from the beginning of the liquid culture, pellets of 
5-10 mm in diameter and laccase activities of 2 U/ml were achieved. Increased enzyme activity in cultures with smaller pellets seems to  be due to a better oxygen supply inside the 
pellet (Ha et al. 2001) whilst in larger pellets ox ygen starvation might still happen, due to the 
enlarged diameter increasing the length of the diffusion ways (Michel et al. 1992). 
 
3. Vessel and impeller 
The aeration of fungal cultures depends not only on the flow rate of compressed air, pure 
oxygen or other gases, but also on the quality of mixing of the broth (section 2.I). This dispersion is guaranteed by the design of the bioreactor and the used impellers, which are also affecting the mycelial morphology (Cui et al. 1998). On the other side, high biomass concentrations in the bioreactor vessel lead to non-Newtonian flui ds (the viscosity of the fluid 
is not stable), lower oxygen supply and bad heat transfer within the bioreactor. Therefore, an adequate type of mixing is required for optimal fermentation conditions. However, with 
higher stirring and agitation rates an increa sed shear stress towards the hyphae, either in 
pelleted or filamentous form, emerges and, t hus, is critical on fungal morphology.  
 Next to the agitation speed, the impeller (Fig. 1) has a direct influence on the filamentous 
growth form of the organism: Paddle impellers and rushton turbines showed less damage to freely dispersed 
Penicillium chrysogenum  hyphae compared to pitched blade impellers 
(Jüsten et al. 1996). In bioreactor cultures of the basidiomycete P. ostreatus , a rushton 
turbine was compared with two other impeller types: a helical ribbon and an intermig 
impeller (see http://www.ekato.eu/en/products/ek at o-rmt/products/ekato-impellers/  for the 
different impeller types) (Márquez-Rocha et al . 1999). At similar agitation speeds of the 
tested impellers, the size of fungal pellets varied in diamet er with 2.3, 3.5 and 5.1 mm for 
cultures mixed with helical ribbon impeller,  rushton turbine and intermig impeller, 
respectively. On the other side, the specific growth rate of P. ostreatus  increased with 
decreasing pellet diameter (Márquez-Rocha et al. 1999). So far, this is the  
  Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 111Fig. 1  Impeller types: pitched blade impeller (left), rushton turbine or disk stirrer (middle), paddle impeller or blade 
stirrer (right). 
only study with different impe ller types in basidiomycete culture, but a more general 
comparison between impeller and other type of agitation exists. In a stirred vessel of the 
type BioFloIIC (New Brunswick Scientific) wit h rushton turbines, the white-rot fungus 
T. versicolor  grows in a pellet form with variable diameters of 0.5 to 3 mm, whereas a 
self-assembled magnetic stir bar reactor (MSBR)  gave smaller pellets of more unique size 
(~1 mm) (Thiruchelvam and Ramsay 2007). This shows that impeller types have an direct 
impact on the fungal morphology, beside th eir main aim of mixing the culture broth. 
 
Almost no studies on pellet morphology are available on large scale for basidiomycetes, but lab scale studies can give an overview (Tab le 2). Generally, it seems that with higher 
agitation rate of flask cultures the pellet di ameter decreases, with diameters of 6.6 mm at 
100 rpm, 1.0 to 3.5 mm at 100-200 rpm and be low 1.0 mm with agitation rates higher than 
200 rpm (Table 2). In a study with the white rot fungus 
Lentinus tigrinus , pellet morphology 
was not discussed, but the mode of agitation (stirred vessel versus ai rlift-reactor) had an 
influence on the yield of enzyme. In the stirred vessel, an agitation rate of 250 and 500 rpm gave best results for laccase yields of 4.6 and 4.0 U/ml, respectively. The used aeration rate of 1.0 vvm gave highest laccase yields, whereas higher aeration increased fungal biomass, but decreased laccase activity (Fenice et al. 2003). In contrast, 
L. tigrinus  showed higher 
MnP yields in bubble columns compared to stirred vessels (Quaratino et al. 2006). Lower shear forces and better oxygen supply in the bubble columns might be the reason for higher enzyme yields, but it shows also that probably for each fungus a new approach is needed for defining best fermentation conditions.   When looking more closely at the pellet morphology, it is seen that the inner structure of the pellets might be influenced by agitation rate or stirrer speed. Evidence of this comes from 
Chapter 3 
 112 shaken cultures of P. chrysosporium  (Michel et al. 1990, 1992), in which pellet morphology 
depends on the agitation rate of the shaking flask (Table 2). Cross sections of pellets 
obtained at lower speed (100 rpm, pellet Ø 6. 6 mm) showed a hollow centre with an outer 
shell of about 1 mm. Higher agitation rates of  150 and 200 rpm resulted in smaller pellets 
between 1-2 mm in diameter and, concomitantly, there was an increased enzymatic yield 
with an optimal extra-cellular LiP activity of 341 and 376 U/l, respectively (Michel et al. 
1990).   Also the working volume, which is defined as the volume of medium per vessel volume and 
given in percentage, has an impact on fungal morphology in flask cultures, whereas larger 
culture volumes seems favorable over small ones as stated by Leisola et al. (1985), who used a culture broth to flask factor of 0.3.   
4. Mode of cultivation 
The process of submerged cultivation can be classified into discontinuous (batch and fed-batch) and continuous cultures. In batch and fed-batch cultures the product (metabolite or biomass) is harvested at the end of the process, whereas in continuous mode the culture is kept at a steady state and harvest takes place continuously (see section 2.I for further explanations). Most of the cultivations are do ne in batch and sometimes in fed-batch mode, 
but very rarely continuously. The complexity of  the problems for fermentation of filamentous 
organisms is even higher in continuous cultures than within normal batch operations (Papagianni 2004). An example for a continuous cultivation system is given by Yao et al. (1995), who cultivated the basidiomycete 
Arthromyces ramosus for peroxidase production. 
The authors used a stainless steel mesh with a specific size to retain the mycelium of 
A. ramosus  inside the stirred vessel bioreactor just above its elutriation point, where the 
mycelial biomass would be washed out from th e fermenter. A comparis on between two mesh 
sizes (1 mm and 2 mm) and a normal continuous culture, where the culture broth was abstracted from the bioreactor without a me sh, revealed that the mesh with a size of 
~ 2 mm was most adequate for 
A. ramosus  cultures. In the continuous culture with a mesh 
size of 2 mm, the production rate of the peroxidase increased up to 3.2 times compared to the fed-batch culture and this rate was kept fo r over 100 h (Yao et al. 1995). The fine mesh 
(1 mm) retained almost all mycelia and, ther efore, leads to high biomass yields but low 
productivity. In continuous cultures without application of a mesh, the mycelium was washed out from the fermenter. By altering the mesh size, this technique could be applied to other Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 113filamentous organisms, having a different morphological pattern in submerged agitated 
cultures.  
B. Conclusion 
The overview from literature data given here showed that several factors in liquid fermentations have an influence on fungal morphology and, therefore, on the productivity of enzymes of interest. Some factors, such as  vessel and impeller type, are defined by the 
construction of the bioreactor. Some cultivation parameters, such as the inoculums size, are defined before the submerged fermentation start.  Others, such as oxygen concentration, pH 
and temperature, change during cultivation. Generally, these latter parameters can be automatically controlled in bioreactors in contra st to shake flask cultures, where controllable 
parameters are normally restri cted to temperature and agitation. Control of fermentation 
parameters requires standard methods for obse rvation of the filamentous growth, which can 
help to clarify the relation between fungal morp hology and growth conditions (section 3.II). 
As already stated in section 3.I, most of th e available studies focus on the morphology of 
filamentous ascomycetes and on ly some studies re veal an insight into the filamentous 
growth of basidiomycetes in submerged cultures. More studies on the fermentation of basidiomycetes are needed to understand their morphological behaviour in shake flask cultures, stirred bioreactors or other ferm entation vessels (Fazenda et al. 2008).  Chapter 3 
 114 II. Tools for analysis of biomass and morpholog y of organisms 
Much is known about the submerged cultivation of unicellular bacteria and yeasts. Many 
textbooks, dealing with submerged fermentation (SmF) and techniques used for process control of liquid cultures, restrict the knowledge on single cell cultures. A more complex growth has to be considered when talking about the fermentation of filamentous microorganisms and fungi in particular (Paul and Thomas 1998). The determination or control of the morphology of the filamentous or ganisms is very important, as it has an 
impact on many different parameters during th e cultivation: rheology of the culture broth, 
oxygen transfer, heat transfer and also productivity (Paul and Thomas 1998). The observation of the fungal morphology during cultivation is one important factor for the understanding of fungal behaviour and for later applications, where production of valuable 
metabolites is of interest. 
 
A. General biomass determination 
Online biomass monitoring of single cell cu ltures is a standard process using the 
measurement of the optical density (turbidimetry) with photometers either in a cuvette outside of the bioreactor or  directly inside the vessel (Chmiel 2006). For a direct 
measurement of the biomass of filamentous organisms, determination of an OD does not make much sense, since the measuring of the medium with variable amounts of hyphal fragments can thus result in an under- or overestimation of biomass, e.g. when evaluating the free medium part of samples with very la rge pellets. In contrast, the large pellets 
themselves would completely darken the small light beam of the photometer.   
Special developed sensors for biomass monitoring offer a more easier and simpler approach 
than OD
600 measurements. Such new sensors are base d on the possibility to polarise intact 
cell membranes which then act as small electrical  capacitors. The electrical signal is then 
correlated to the cell surface, respectively cell amount (AberProbe™ + BiomassMonitor by 
www.aberinstruments.com , BIOMASS system by FOGALEnanotech www.fogalebiotech.com ). 
Although this kind of sensors were initially developed for single cell cultures, the system was already tested also for the filamentous organism 
Absidia corymbifera  grown in pellet-like 
form (see FOGALEnanotech www.fogalebiotech.com ). Another method for direct online 
monitoring of cell growth in bioreactors was presented by Bittner et al. (1998). The sensor 
used in this study consists of a stainless st eel tube with a sampling chamber at its end of 
2.2 x 10-8 ml. The trapped cells can be observed by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 115via the in situ microscope attached to the tube. Besides the biomass of the cultivated 
ascomycetous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the authors could also define cell amount 
and size (Bittner et al. 1998).  
 
Another optical method is the laser scanning microscopy (a laser beam can be scattered by particles and the scattered light is collected by a ph oto detector), which can be used as a 
sensor for monitoring of particle sizes. This technique was used for on -line determination of 
size and concentration of aggregated spores of 
Aspergillus niger  cultivated in a stirred vessel 
(Grimm et al. 2004). The same group analysed also later stages of growth in A. niger  
cultures by light microscopy combined with an image analysis system (Kelly et al. 2006).   Anyhow, except for the first stages of fungal growth in liquid cultures (spore germination 
and aggregation), sensors can not yet observe and describe the morphology of the fungal growth either in pellet like or free filame ntous form. Thus, techniques to observe and 
analyse fungal morphology are needed. An introduction on different methods is given below.  
B. Approaches to determine morpholo gical charact eristics of free 
hyphae and mycelial pellets 
First of all, the observation of filamentous growth depends on the form of mycelia – the 
fungal morphology. Generally, filamentous mo rphology changes during cultivation and 
different forms of growth and development may be observed such as spore germination, first aggregation of hyphae, hyphal aggregation into  small clumps and pellet formation (Fig. 1).

and C were taken with the help of a microscope (Axioplan 2, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen) and 
image D was taken with the help of a binocular (Stemi 2000-C, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen). This 
experiment was a pre-study done for the master thesis of Max Richter (Richter 2008).

 116 Upon spore germination (section 3.I.A), the filamentous organism can either stay in its freely 
dispersed hyphal form (filamentous growth) or may aggregate into clumps and pellets (pellet 
growth). For both morphological forms different  parameters can be observed, such as tip 
elongation, septation and branching of hyphae , as well as pellet size , shape and hairiness 
(Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 Typical parameters that are observed during cultivation of fungi for their definition of the filamentous growth 
forms as adapted from Paul et al. (1993) and Lejeune and Baron (1998). 
 
 For pellet description, the mo st commonly used parameter is the pellet size which can be 
determined mechanically by sieving fungal cult ures with different mesh sizes (Michel et al. 
1990, Fang and Zhong 2002). Nevertheless, this technique restricts the user to only one 
parameter and, thus, other methods are more adequate than sieving to observe and analyse filamentous growth in liquid cultures. Some possible techniques are described in the following.  Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 1171. General image analysis 
The most common approach to observe parameters indicated in Fig. 2 is image analysis. The 
image analysis consists of the sample prepar ation, image acquisition and image evaluation. 
Sample preparation includes sampling of aliquots from the fungal culture, dilution of the 
sample and slide preparation for image acquisit ion. To record the image, a microscope with 
appropriate magnification and a camera, normally a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, is 
needed. With the following computer based analysis of the recorded image the different morphological parameters listed in Fig. 3 may be described and interpreted. Such factors which can be obtained by image analysis were listed by Paul and Thomas (1998). In their study, the authors presented four different image approaches which represent all possible forms (Fig. 1): i. dispersed mo rphology ii. pellet morphology iii. spore germination and iv. 
hyphal differentiation. The authors divide d the parameters needed for all forms of 
filamentous growth into object size (area or projected area, perimeter, convex perimeter, …), object count (number of pellets, other objects or hyphal tips), object shape (circularity, roughness, …), object position (coordinates of an object) and object brightness (grey intensity of an object in a monochromatic imag e). Generally, since size and type of spore 
germination, hyphal differentiation and pellete d morphology vary to a high degree between 
fungal cultures, it may be necessary for each growth form to apply different observation techniques (Paul et al. 1993, Pa ul and Thomas 1998). In many studies in the literature, only 
pellets were observed and analysed. Parameters were for example the shape, such as hairy or smooth pellets, distribution of pellets within the culture liquid, se dimentation of pellets, 
size and viscosity of the culture fluid (Cox and Thomas 1992, Reichl et al. 1992b, Gehrig et al. 1998, Znidarsic et al. 2000, Žmak et al . 2006). Nevertheless, analysis can be more 
complex as found for 
Aspergillus oryzae  in the study of Carlsen et al. (1996), who 
determined  hyphal tip elongation, pellet size and pellet fragmentation.   
2. Automated image analysis 
Manual image analysis, as used in most of the above mentioned studies, is very time 
consuming and less adequate than computer ba sed image analysis software. Due to lower 
prices and improvements of the hard- and software for image processing, automation of image analysis is nowadays a standard method . One main advantage is the tremendous gain 
of time, as shown for an automated image analysis via a microscope with subsequent data processing which reduced the time of pellet an alysis from 67 s to 4.6 s per pellet (Cox and 
Thomas 1992). Nevertheless, on-line measurem ent together with automated image analysis Chapter 3 
 118 would enable to control the fermentation of filamentous organisms in liquid cultures (Reichl 
et al. 1992b). Up to now, different solution s for combinations of on-line observation and 
automated image analysis were presented. An on-line monitoring for filamentous organism 
was implemented using a growth chamber which was placed under the microscope (Reichl et 
al. 1992a, Spohr et al. 1998). The authors fixed spores of the filamentous bacterium 
Streptomyces tendae  and of the fungus A. oryzae  with poly-d-lysine on the bottom of the 
growth chamber and observed hyphal growth and branching after germination. Because of the small chamber volume (80 µl in Spohr et al. 1998 and 1.2 ml in Reichl et al. 1992a), such a system is restricted to basic studies for spore germination and hyphal growth. A further 
development to the simple growth chamber is a flow-through cell, which is connected with a bioreactor (Treskatis et al. 1997). In the study by Treskati s et al. (1997), samples with 
S. 
tendae  cells were automatically taken and dilute d and pumped into a flow-through chamber 
which was placed under an inverted micros cope. Sample images were taken with a CCD 
camera. The imaged sample was then discarded and the picture was analysed by a personal computer (Treskatis et al. 1997). Although the chamber of the flow-through cell used by Treskatis et al. (1997) had a height of 2 mm, pelleted growth would be hard to observe without damaging the pellets because pellets tend to be larger than 2 mm in diameter (Table 
2 in section 3.I). 
 
A main problem which is a cons equence of these ex-situ (out of the bioreactor vessel) 
measurement systems is the loss of culture volume, due to disposing of the sample. Especially in small fermentation system this is a bottleneck (Chmiel 2006). Anyhow, on-line measurement of the fungal morphology as described above is restricted due to the high complexity of automatic sampling and appropriate dilution of the sample. Therefore, commercial products, i.e. sensors for measuring the size and distribution of particles, are needed.  
3. Methods for a more precise image analysis  
For observation of cells of microorganism, di fferent staining methods can be applied to 
compare between viable and dead cells (Bittner et al. 1998) in single cell cultures and in 
filamentous growth stages (Agger et al. 1998) . For filamentous fungi, several fluorescence 
staining compounds were applied.   The fluorescence dye Mag fura (tetra potassium salt), which detects divalent ions (i.e. Mg
2+), 
was used to stain metabolic active hyphae of the ascomycetes Aspergillus nidulans,  Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 119A. oryzae  and Penicillium chrysogenum  in order to analyse fragmentation of hyphae (Cox 
and Thomas 1999, McIntyre et al. 2001).  In another study, differentiation of A. oryzae  
hyphae were visualised by the fluorescence dye DiOC 6 (3,3’-dihexyloxacarbocyanine) which 
enrich in the mitochondria of active fungal cells (Agger et al. 1998). To have a comparison 
for the complete biomass, Calcofluor white wa s used in all three above mentioned studies 
since this dye stains ß1-4 glyc osidic linkages present in chitin  in the cell wall independently 
whether the cells are dead or alive. Another po ssibility to determine active fungal biomass is 
the usage of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) (Ing ham and Klein 1982). FDA is proposed to be 
taken up into living cells by active transport. Wi thin the cells it is hydrolysed by esterases. 
One product of this hydrolysis is fluorescein leading to intracellular green light emission [ λmax 
= 514nm]. In the study of Ingham and Klein (1982), the active biomass was compared with 
total bio dry mass, as well as glucose and oxygen consumption.  One single substance which can be used to differentiate between both, active parts and total biomass, can ease the analysis. In 
A. niger  liquid cultures, the fl uorescence dye acridine 
orange was used to differentiate between active and non-active parts in dispersed hyphae and pellets (El-Enshasy et al. 2006). This dye emits red light [ λ
max = 650 nm] when bound to 
single stranded RNA which indicate active  parts of the mycelium and green light [ λmax = 525 
nm] when bound to DNA. The authors observed with this technique the influence of different agitation rates on fungal morphology. Incr eased agitation rates (200, 500 and 800 rpm) 
resulted in a more filamentous growth of 
A. niger , but also in higher shear stress and, 
therefore, lower biomass. Intermediate agitation speed resulted in small pellets which had an active outer zone and seems to be best for production of glucose oxidase (El-Enshasy et al. 2006).   A different approach to visualise active parts of growing hyphae is the usage of reporter genes, such as the green fluorescen ce protein (GFP) of the jellyfish 
Aequorea victoria . GFP 
emits green fluorescence when activated by UV-light and, thus, can indicate parts of active hyphae. An overexpression of GFP in a filamentous organism may help to clarify questions regarding hyphal activity, heterologous protein production and filamentous growth. For this purpose, a transformation protocol is needed for each fungus, which makes this approach currently inadequate for most of the basidiomycetes. Nevertheless,  several studies with 
basidiomycetes exist where GFP was overexpressed under control of a promoter, whose 
regulation was observed with this te chnique. In the symbiotic fungus 
Hebeloma 
cylindrosporum , it was shown that the C. cinerea  cgl1 promoter fused to the gfp gene ( cgl1-
promoter::GFP) was repressed at higher glucose concentrations (Rekangalt et al. 2007). In a Chapter 3 
 120 recent study, the serine proteinase 1 (SPR1) expression was analysed via GFP production 
under the control of the spr1 promoter ( spr1-promoter::GFP) in Agaricus bisporus  and 
C. cinerea . GFP was found differently expressed in various types of fruiting body tissue 
(Heneghan et al. 2009). Another development is the usage of a gene fusion construct, where a gene of interest is fused in frame to the GFP gene and, therefore, the resulting fused protein can be observed in the organism. For example, this was done for the plant pathogenic basidiomycete 
Ustilago maydis  where the motor protein Kin2 was fused to GFP 
(Kin2::GFP) and, thus, could be localised in hyphal cells (Lehmler et al. 1997).  
 In the ascomycete 
A. niger , such fusion gene constructs were already applied in studies of 
fungal morphology in liquid culture (Xu et al. 2000, Wang et al. 2003, Talabardon and Yang 
2005). In these studies, a glucoamylase-GFP construct was used to monitor secreted protein concentration and compared with protease activity. Xu et al. (2000) varied the spore inoculum level in liquid shaken cultures to op timise pellet size with regard to highest GFP 
yields and low protease activity. The optimal pellet had an average diameter of 1.6 mm when a spore inoculum of 4 x 10
6 spores/ml was used. Further to this, in bioreactor cultures 
of A. niger , the influence of the type of fermentation system (SmF and SSF) on heterologous 
protein production and secretion as well as fungal morphology was observed with the 
glucoamylase-GFP construct (Talabardon and Yang 2005).  
 An obstacle important to observe is the altered growth of positive 
gfp-transformants 
compared to the wild type strains (Bae an d Knudsen 2000) and also between different 
clones (own observation documented in Fig. 3). Thus, for a definite conclusion more transformants have to be studied for their growth behaviour in liquid cultures.

the control of the A. bisporus  gpdII- promoter in the construct pYPH8 provided by P.J. Hoegger) grown in modified 
Kjalke medium in shake flasks at 120 rpm and 37 °C after inoculation with a 4 day old pre-culture. Sample of the 
culture broth of the different clones with different sized pellets at day 4 of cultivation are shown in Petri dishes 
(upper row) and fluorescence microscopic images (lower row).  Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures

Besides appointing the GFP repo rter system for detection of active cells, detection of a 
housekeeping or otherwise interesting protein vi a histochemical staining or specific visible 
substrates in case of an enzymatic activity can bring respective information (Moukha et al. 
1993, Goodell et al. 1998, Bittner et al. 1998, Jiménez-Tobon et al. 2003, Mander et al. 2006, van der Klei and Veenhuis 2007).   
4. Conclusion 
In summary, image analysis for description of pellet morphology and diversity in filamentous 
growth of fungi is a helpful and important tool  in control of biopro cesses where filamentous 
organisms are used (Znidarsic and Pavko 2001) du e to the fact that productivity of fungal 
metabolites and enzymes can depend on the mo rphology in liquid cultures (Gehrig et al. 
1998).  A combination of image analysis (observa tion of filamentous growth) with either 
overexpression of GFP or other specific staining methods (detection of intracellular activities) may result in a more comprehensive overview on fungal morphology and productivity in liquid culture.  Chapter 3

cultures of filamentous fungi such as the basidiomycete 
Coprinopsis cinerea 
A. Abstract 
In this study, an image analysis system for fungal pellets was developed using the 
commercial software  system analySIS® and the protocol was evaluated in morphological 
studies of pellet formation in submerged cultures of the basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea . 
Pellets were analysed on large scale (60 to 130 pellets per image, 225 to 400 pellets per 
culture). Morphologies of pellets were characterised by the parameters grey value, pellet 
area, convexity, shape factor, sphericity and pe llet diameter. Threshold values were defined 
for all parameters for object filtering. By a pplication of the parameter filter, aggregated 
hyphal fragments present in larger amounts particularly in cultures grown at higher temperature (37 °C) could be clearly distinguishe d in image analysis from compact pellets. At 
a lower growth temperature (25 °C), there was little background of loose hyphal material, fungal pellets were regularly shaped and the pellets remained constant in shape and size 
over a longer cultivation period.   
B. Introduction 
Various filamentous fungi are used in biotechnology for production of biomass, secondary metabolites, polysaccharides and/or enzymes and other proteins. Usually, filamentous fungi are cultivated in liquid medium in suitable fermenters. Typically, the fungi will grow in a 
pelleted form (Braun and Vecht-Lifshitz 199 1, Fazenda et al. 200 8). Determination of 
pelleted growth of filamentous organisms in liqui d cultures is mostly done by image analysis, 
which can be conducted manually (Michel et al. 1990, Nielsen et al. 1995) or automatically 
(Màrquez-Rocha et al. 1999, Kelly et al. 20 06). Automatic image analysis implies that 
pictures of the pellet culture are taken and analysed by a computer based programme regarding specific parameters, which can be e.g. pellet concentration and pellet diameter. Studies exist where such an automatic image an alysis was performed on liquid cultures of 
basidiomycetes (Gehrig et al. 1998, Hwang et al. 2004, Kim et al. 2006).  In an early study, Michel et al. (1990) anal ysed manually just 15 pellets obtained from 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  cultures with respect to pellet diameter. Later on, 
Márquez-Rocha et al. (1990) determined by automated image analysis the diameter of Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 123Pleurotus ostreatus  pellets but only 20 pellets per cult ure were surveyed. However, also in 
more recent studies of three Phellinus  species and of Ganoderma resinaceum  (Hwang et al. 
2004, Kim et al. 2006) only the diameter of 50  pellets were analysed per fungal sample. In 
contrast, Gehrig et al. (1998) gave a more complete picture of pellets of Cyathus striatus  
during a fermentation process. The authors analysed in total about 2000 pellets and a broad 
spectrum of parameters, such as pellet concentration, pellet diameters, total pellet volume 
(by using average diameter values) and pellet density (from the total biomass dry weight 
and the total pellet volume).  The studies have in common that all used a CCD  camera to obtain photos either on the 
microscopic scale or on a larger scale with images of areas of up to a few cm
2 [e.g. 2.25 cm2 
in the study by Gehrig et al. (1998)]. The phot os were required for determination of pellet 
parameters. For evaluation of the images, diff erent image analysis software was applied, 
some of which were commercially  (Kelly et al. 2006, Kim et al. 2006) and some of which 
were especially written for the analysis of pellet morphology [programme by Defren (1993) appointed in Gehrig et al (1998)].  In the following, using shake flas k cultures of the basidiomycete 
Coprinopsis cinerea , a 
protocol is defined to be applied for morpholo gical studies of fungal pellets and bioreactor 
cultures. For the analysis of the fungal morpho logy in liquid cultures, complete shaken flask 
cultures or samples taken from the bioreactor cultures are poured onto a bordered glass plate. Detailed images are taken with a CCD camera and the software analySIS
® (Soft 
Imaging System GmbH, Münster, Germany) is used to analyse the fungal morphology from obtained images. The so obtained raw data are filtered by defined parameters that 
unequivocally distinguish pellets from other objects (small hyphal fragments and loosely aggregated hyphal filaments). Data processing obtains afterwards the final data describing the actual fungal morphology (Fig. 1).

 124 C. Material and Methods 
1. Fungal cultures 
A monokaryotic C. cinerea strain (FA2222) transformed with the pYSK7 plasmid expressing 
the laccase gene lcc1 from C. cinerea  under control of the gpdII -promoter of Agaricus 
bisporus  was used (Kilaru et al. 2006). The pYSK7-transformant (clone 26) was grown on 
YMG-agar (per litre: 4 g yeast; 10 g malt extract; 4 g glucose; 10 g agar) plates at 37 °C 
until the mycelium reached the edge of the petri dish. Sterile water (ddH 2O) was poured 
onto the plates and the mycelium with the asexual spores was scraped with a sterile spatula from the agar. Spore solutions were filtered us ing a sterile funnel filled with glass wool in 
order to hold back the fungal hyphae. A Thoma counting chamber was used to determine spore concentrations in the solutions.   For shake flask cultures, pre-cultures inoculated with 10
6 spores/ml medium were prepared 
in 500 ml flasks filled with 50 ml of modified  Kjalke medium [Kjalke et al. 1992; per litre: 10 
g yeast, 20 g glucose, 0.5 g CaCl 2 x 2 H 2O, 2 g KH 2PO4, 50 mg MgSO 4 x 7 H 2O]. Inoculated 
flasks were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C as st ationary (standing) cultures. Pre-cultures were 
homogenised by an Ultra-Turrax® (IKA Werke GmbH & Co. KG, Staufen, Germany) for 
30 sec at 8000 rpm and 30 sec at 9500 rpm (rot ations per minute). For main-cultures, 500 
ml flasks with 100 ml of sterile modified Kjalke medium supplemented with 0.1 mM CuSO 4 
were inoculated with each 5 ml of the homoge nised pre-culture. Cultivation took place at 
25 °C and 37 °C on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm for 4 and 10 days, respectively. Per culture day and cultivation temperature, two or three parallel cultures were analysed. 
 Fungal shaken cultures were po ured onto a glass plate (28.5 cm x 38.5 cm, Fig. 2) whose 
edges were sealed by a silicone border in order to keep the liquid samples on the plate. 
Water (200 to 300 ml) was added to equally distribute the mycelium as a monolayer of 
pellets on the glass plate. When necessary, pe llets lumped together were manually dispersed 
with the help of a spatula or forceps.   Total fungal biomass was determined after ta king images by filtering complete cultures 
through a Büchner funnel containing a cellulose filter of known dry weight. The filters together with the wet biomass were dried at 80 °C and the dry weights of the biomass were determined.

 1252. Imaging 
To record pellet growth, the glass plate with a f ungal sample was placed onto the illuminated 
translucent plate of a camera stand (Kaiser Copy lizer eVision ini.tial HF, Kaiser Fototechnik 
GmbH & Co. KG, Buchen, Germany) with a digital CCD camera (Color View II, Soft Imaging 
System GmbH, Münster, Germany) installed at a distance of 28 cm to the glass plate. Images were recorded with the CCD camera to  which a Lametar 2.8/25 objective (Jenoptik 
GmbH, Jena, Germany) was fixed. Three non-overlapping photographs (dashed lines in Fig. 2) were taken of each culture.

3. Analysis of the images 
Pictures were evaluated using analySIS® (Soft Imaging System GmbH, Münster, Germany), a 
software tool for the analysis of microscopic images of biological materials. The magnification, defined by the sp ecific objective at the CCD camera used at a distance of 
28 cm to the specimen, was set to be 0.132 (equivalent to 0.0418 mm/pixel).

Fig. 3  Processing of photographs of fungal cultures with analySIS®. A picture of the fungal culture ( A) is reduced 
to a monochromatic image ( B). A region of interest (ROI) for pellet determination is defined ( C) and the pellets 
are detected as documented in Fig. 5 by analySIS® (D) after setting a specific threshold (see Fig. 4) for best 
distinction of pellets and background. 
 
The subsequent steps for the process of automated image analysis using predefined 
functions of the software analySIS® are explained in the following: 
 
• Function RGB reduction:  The coloured photograph (Fig. 3A) were reduced to their 
RGB (red, green and blue) colours. Of the three pictures obtained, the green monochromatic images (Fig. 3B) gave the best contrast between pellets and background. The green monochromatic images were therefore used for further analysis in form of a grey value scale.  
• Function Define ROI:
 A region of interest (ROI, Fig. 3C) had to be defined and loaded 
into a picture. This ROI defines the area in the image, where objects were analysed. 
With the magnification as defined above, a ROI of 40.66 cm2 was used (Fig. 3C). 
• Function Define measurement:  In analySIS®, a pre-defined set of object parameters 
can be chosen, of which the following were selected for pellet detection and 
description (Fig. 3D): grey value mean, area, convexity, shape factor and sphericity. Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 127Moreover, the average diameters of the individual pellets were determined in 
analySIS® from 180 measurements of diameters per object, i.e. one at every degree. 
• Function Set threshold:  To distinguish the compact mycelial pellets from loose hyphal 
fragments as background, the settings of the analySIS® software had to be manually 
adjusted in the programme to a specific threshold determined by the background in a given monochromatic image. Usually, the threshold was set to 180 in order to reject the peak of smaller objects (hyphal fragments) and other background within the bimodal distribution of greyness level as seen in Fig. 4.

modified Kjalke medium at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively ( A and C ). The bimodal distribution of greyness 
levels (on a scale from 0 = black to 255 = white; black is at the left and white is at the right side of the 
histograms B and D) deduced from these images and the corresponding settings for defining the background 
threshold for the monochromatic images in A and C are presented in B and D, respectively.  
 
• Function Define Detection:  A projected area per object is determined by counting the 
pixels per object being connected within the area due to a same grey value contrast. 
A minimum pixel amount of 10 per object was set to exclude any remaining smaller 
loosely aggregated filamentous fragments from further analysis. Detection of the fungal pellets covered by the ROI was done twice: Include and Exclude. In case of 
the Include function, all pellets inside the ROI plus those that cross the ROI borders Chapter 3 
 128 were measured. In case of the Exclude func tion, only pellets localised fully within the 
ROI were detected (Fig. 5). 
 
 
Fig. 5  Each image was analysed twice by analySIS®. The settings for the determination ( A) were used for an 
Include-recording ( B) of the ROI (dashed line). For an Exclude-recording ( C), the border particles were 
respectively set onto function Exclude. 
 
• Function Particle Results:  Parameters for all pellets we re calculated for the Include 
and for the Exclude setting, respectively, and obtained data were saved in separate 
spreadsheet files, where each row presents the information for one specific object and each column specific object parameters as defined above.  
 
4. Data processing 
All calculations were done for the raw data set and for filtered data sets. Object data from 
the three analysed images per culture were combined (Include and Exclude measurements separately) and the amount of objects, the av erage value of the projected object areas and 
the average object diameter were calculated with the help of a self-implemented programme constructed with pre-defined analysis objects (average with standard deviation and general 
histogram used to automatically cluster objects into 19 distinct groups of 0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 
0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0, 1-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, 10-12, 12 -14, 14-16, 16-18, 18-20, 21-25, 
25-30, 30-50 and 50-500 mm
2 pellet area) of the programming language LabView™ 
(www.ni.com/labview). The object data were sa ved automatically in individual spreadsheet 
files for further analysis of Include and Exclude data in Excel (Excel 2002, Microsoft). The average Include data and, respectively, the average Exclude data for the projected area and the object diameter from two or three parallel cultures per growth condition were combined Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 129and averaged. Next, values derived from Include and Exclude measurements were averaged 
in order to include a proportionate fraction of objects into the analysis that either touch or cross the ROI border lines so that the complete ROIs are best covered. For calculating the average amounts of objects per culture, the total amounts of objects in the three ROIs analysed per culture were determined and averaged between the cultures of a same growth condition separately for the Include and Exclud e data set, respectively. Subsequently, the 
values derived from Include and Exclude measurements were averaged and this average value was multiplied by a factor of 9.0 resultin g in the average number of pellets per 100 ml 
culture liquid.  
D. Results 
Upon inoculation of fresh C. cinerea  cultures in modified Kjalke medium, compact round to 
oval pellets dominated at day 4 of cultivation in the shaken cultures, both at 25 °C and 37 °C. In the monochromatic images of the cultures, pellets had a strong grey-shade. However, at the higher cultivation temperature the background including fine hyphal material was generally higher and, in addition, lighter shaded loosely aggregated hyphal fragments were also present (Fig. 6). In older cultures at day 10 of cultivation at 25 °C, 
there were no larger differences of pellet structure in the views of the cultures as compared to day 4 of cultivation. In co ntrast, in addition to dark-shaded compact pellets and loose 
aggregates of filamentous fragments, pellets of less dense stru cture and lighter grey shading 
accumulated in the aging cultures grow n for 10 days at 37 °C (Fig. 6).

Chapter 3 
 130 Particularly in the 37 °C cultures, the projected areas of some of the loosely aggregated 
filamentous fragments were larger than the minimum size of 10 pixel (projected area = 
0.017 mm2) per object as fixed for pe llet recognition in the analysis software (see below and 
Fig. 7 for further details). Such filamentous fragments will thus  interfere with pellet analysis. 
In addition to the mean grey value and the projected area of an object, convexity, shape factor and sphericity (Table 1) were therefore chosen as other parameters in order to better 
describe pellet morphology and clearly dist inguish between fungal pellets and loose 
filamentous aggregates. Threshold values for filtering as given in Table 1 were empirically 
defined in order to confidently exclude any loose filamentous aggregates from further pellet analysis.  For processing the raw data sets in the spreadsheet files obtained from the function “Particle Results”, at least 3 of the measured values pe r row (each row defining one detected object) 
have to pass the defined threshold values for positive filtering of an object as a pellet. If not achieved, a row will automatically be deleted from the raw data  set. Fig. 7 demonstrates

 131examples of such positive and negative filtering. Each recognised object in Fig. 7A was 
identified by a number and overlaid with a shad ing representing the projected area of an 
object (Fig. 7B). When comparing the objects in the original monochromatic image (Fig. 7A) 
with the shades overlaid by the analySIS® programme (Fig. 7B), it  becomes clear that the 
objects with the number 18 and 21 having a projected area above 10 pixel (0.06 and 0.09 mm
2, respectively) are not pellets but loosely aggregated filaments. The filter implemented 
for the pellet data however remove these objects from the raw data set, because the threshold values for parameters grey value, area and shape factor were not reached (see Fig. 7 data sheet). In other cases of loosely aggregated filaments, the threshold values e.g. for the combination grey value, shape factor and sphericity or for the combination grey value, convexity and shape factor were not reached (data not shown). In extensive empirical data analysis, a minimum of three parameters were found to be necessary for save pellet 
filtering from other objects in order not to eliminate very small pellets  of low grey shading 
and/or low convexity from the raw data sets (not further shown).

aggregated hyphal fragments, respectively. Values shaded in grey did not reach the defined limits. 
 
The defined filter were applied to the raw data  sets (Include and Ex clude separately), the 
Include and Exclude data were combined and averaged as described in the methods in order to obtain the average number of pellets per culture. After applying the filter, the number of objects from the raw data sets reduced by 2- 24%, respectively, depending on the type of 
cultures analysed (Table 2). In total, about 225 to 400 pellets (30 to 160 per individual image) were analysed per individual culture. The calculated total pellet numbers per culture 
varied from about 2300 to 3400 (Table 2).  Chapter 3

* For each culture condition, three flasks were analysed except for day 4 of cultivation at 37 °C where only two 
flasks were used. Absolute numbers of objects analysed per culture condition were added from the two or three 
cultures, respectively.  
 
With the time in 25 °C cultures, there was a strong increase in absolute numbers of detected 
pellets per culture (about 2400 pellets at day 4 to about 3400 pellets at day 10) and a little 
increase in average pellet area [about 4.8 mm2 at day 4 to about 5.0 mm2 at day 10; both values corresponded well with th e peak value in histograms of the individual pellet areas 
(not shown)], whereas the average pellet diameter decreased slightly from about 2.57 mm at day 4 to about 2.51 mm at day 10. The percentage of non-pellet objects (loose hyphal aggregates) increased from 2% at day 4 of cultiv ation to 9% at day 10 of cultivation. These 
data from automated image analysis confirm the impression of the former rough overview that pellets in cultures at 25 °C  change little in shape and size  within the 6 following days of 
incubation.  The situation in the 37 °C cultures was diffe rent. Absolute pellet numbers decreased from 
about 3000 pellets per flask at day 4 of cultivat ion to 2300 per flask at day 10 of cultivation, 
but the average pellet area [corresponded agai n well with the peak value in histograms of 
the individual pellet areas (not shown)] increased from 5.1 mm
2 at day 4 of cultivation to 
about 5.5 mm2 at day 10 of cultivation along with th e average pellet diameter (from 2.40 
mm at day 4 to 2.70 mm at day 10). As documented in Fig. 8, the 4 day-old cultures at 37 °C had generally a higher background of small hyphal fragments and a larger fraction of total detected objects (21%; Table 2) were identified in the raw data set as loose 
filamentous aggregates. At day 10 of cultivation, the amount of hyphal fragments in the background was lower (Fig. 8) and, in parallel, also the amount of loose aggregated 
filaments detected by the automated image analysis (9%; Table 2). In summary, the data Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 133imply that major morphological changes occur at 37 °C during the period of cultivation from 
day 4 to day 10.  At both growth temperatures, the differences in average pellet numbers and average pellet areas (Table 2) corresponded well with changes in biomass. The 25 °C cultures had a mycelial biomass of 5.6 ± 0.2 g/l and 8.3 ± 0.1 g/l at day 4 and day 10 of cultivation, 
respectively. The 37 °C cultures had a biomass of 8.3 ± 0.2 g/l and 5.5 g/l ± 0.3 g/l at day 4 
and day 10 of cultivation, respectively. At 25 °C as the suboptimal temperature for growth of 
C. cinerea  (Kües 2000), 10 days are obviously required to achieve highest biomass yields 
whereas the reduction in total biomass at 37 °C implies that the fungus is at day 10 of cultivation already in a major phase of biomass degeneration.

E. Discussion 
Pellet morphology is known to be influenced by culture conditions and, in turn, to affect 
biomass formation and production yields in submerged fungal fermentations (Papagianni 2004, Fazenda et al. 2008). Effects of temp erature and age on submerged growth of 
C. cinerea  used as an example in this study are obvious from the photographs shown in 
Fig. 6 and Fig. 8 and from the data presented in Table 2. This fungus has its growth optimum at 37 °C (Kües 2000). Accordingly, we observe that cultures at this temperature 
have a faster growth rate, reach the highest possible biomass levels earlier and undergo faster biomass degeneration than cultures kept at the lower temperature of 25 °C (Table 2 and Rühl et al. unpublished results). With the lower growth rate and the delay in biomass degeneration, the overall pellet structures of the cultures grown at 25 °C were much more compact and uniformly than the structures of pellets grown at 37 °C. Moreover in the 25 °C 
Chapter 3 
 134 cultures, there was much less background of small hyphal fragments and of loose 
aggregated hyphal filaments (Fig. 6 and Fig. 8). C. cinerea  is a filamentous basidiomycete 
that can easily be manipulated by genetic transformation (Binninger et al. 1987, Granado et 
al. 1997). The fungus has thus found interest for production of glycosylated enzymes from higher basidiomycetes that will not or only po orly be expressed and most possible wrongly 
be glycosylated in established ascomycete systems for recombinan t enzyme production 
(Ogawa et al. 1998, Kikuchi et al. 1999, Kila ru et al. 2006). Laccases are for examples 
enzymes in focus for reco mbinant production with 
C. cinerea  in efficient fermentation 
processes (Kilaru 2006, Kilaru et al. 2006, Rühl  et al. unpublished results). Studying fungal 
pellet morphology will be benefici al for optimising the fermen tation processes and enzyme 
production yields.   An efficient and easy to apply routine technique for observation and large scale pellet analysis for 
C. cinerea  but also other filamentous fungi is presented in this work. By taking 
three images per culture, 225 to 400 pellets  per culture are simultaneously and easily 
characterised by applying specific functions of the commercial analySIS® software. If higher 
pellet numbers of the same culture are required, further non-overlapping images might easily be taken of other areas of the glass plates onto which the pellets were poured (compare Fig. 2). Pellets for taking photographs are easily spread on the bordered glass plate from cultures with a pellet number of about 2000-2500 per 100 ml. With increasing pellet numbers, in some cases pellets were found  packed in densely clusters on the glass 
plate and had to be separated manually with  a spatula or forceps. When wanting most 
accurate numbers of pellets per culture, simply diluting the cultures is not as advisable since 
the fungal pellets sink quickly and are difficult to be kept evenly dispersed in solution. Evenly distributing of pellets from dense cultures on the glass plate was therefore in our hands the most time consuming step in the procedure le ading in the worst case to 20 min preparation 
time per culture until images could be taken. Subsequent usage of the analySIS
® software 
helped in a fast and, especially, representative  determination of pellet morphology, as up to 
400 pellets (or more) can be analysed per culture in a few minutes. Considering the 
parameters grey value, pellet area, convexity, shape factor and sphericity with the implemented filter, fungal  pellets and filamentous aggregates could clearly be recognised at 
the same time and distinguished as such both when relative low an d when relative high 
amounts of these two growth forms were obtained in 
C. cinerea  cultures. Such data will 
allow to quantify the nature of mycelial aggreg ates, fragmentation of pellets as well as pellet 
regrowth (Papagianni 2006).  Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 135Most literature studies on fungal morphology during submerged cultivation consider only 
small samples of pellets (see examples for basidiomycetes in the introduction). Gehrig et al. 
(1998), in contrast, observed approximat ely 2000 pellets by image analysis in a C. striatus  
culture by taking pictures of pellets (1-6 mm in diameter) present in a reference area of 15 mm x 15 mm. Total pellet volume was defined by the authors from determination of an average pellet diameter measured from the images of fungal pellets. Moreover, Kelly (2006) 
studied the ascomycete 
Aspergillus niger  and similarly determined the pellet diameter of 500 
to 1000 pellets per A. niger  culture. The description of th e method used by Kelly (2006) is 
not presented in much detail in the publication but it appears that also this author used a 
relatively small reference area  with maximum 30 to 35 pellets when these were comparably 
small and laying quite crowded on the area, forcing the researcher to take many different 
images for obtaining high numbers of different pellets for large scale analysis. In other cases, pellets of 
A. niger  were observed on 1 mm-deep cavity slides in case of very small 
sizes under a microscope or in ca se of larger pellets on an adjustable camera stand equipped 
with a CCD camera fitted with a macroscopic zoom lens. Since the size of the images are restricted by the width of the cavity slide, also in these studies numerous pictures have to be taken for analysing high pellet numbers (Cox  and Thomas 1992, Paul and Thomas 1998, 
Papagianni 2006).  The protocol presented here allows analysis of much higher numbers of pellets (60-130 pellets) per single image. Moreover, additional parameters of mo rphology were considered in 
this study. For simplification of analysis, Ge hrig et al. (1998) and Kelly (2006) assumed a 
spherical shape of the fungal pellets. The photographs and images in Fig. 3 to 8 show that fungal pellets may be stretched in one dimension and that pellets can be of fringy shape. Therefore, a definition of the projected area calc ulated from all connected pixels of an object 
by the software analySIS
® will give much more accurate pelle t area values than is possible 
by only considering the pellet diameters. Although  not analysed in more detail in this study, 
the independently collected individual values for the extra parameters convexity, shape factor and sphericity of the pellets are availa ble from the same analysis if a more deep 
insight into such extra growth parameters for a more detailed description of pellet morphology in 
C. cinerea  will be required. Furthermore, anal ysing the individual grey shades 
of pellets can serve to define a relative distribution of more compact and less dense pellets in a culture. The usefulness of such data for morphological classification of fungal pellets by automated image analysis has be en demonstrated before for 
A. niger  (Cox and Thomas 
1992, Paul and Thomas 1998). Chapter 3 
 136 IV.  Fermentation of C. cinerea  in shake flasks and bioreactors 
A. Abstract 
In this study, laccase transformants of the basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea  strain FA2222 
(carrying the C. cinerea  laccase gene lcc1 subcloned in an expression vector under the 
control of the  gpdII -promoter from  Agaricus bisporus ) was used and compared to a 
transformant carrying a vector without a laccase gene. In standard Coprinopsis  medium at 
37 °C, maximal laccase yields of 3.0 U/ml were achieved with the best lcc1 transformant in 
shake flask cultures. A reduction in temperature from 37 °C to 25 °C increased laccase yields 
up to 9 U/ml and had severe effects on the mo rphology of the mycelial pellets formed during 
cultivation. Therefore, automated image analys is was used to charac terise morphological 
differences in shaken flask and stirred bioreactor cultures of the lcc1 transformant during 
growth at different cultivation conditions. The most important parameter determined by automated image analysis is the projected area of the pellet, which derives from the 2-dimensional image of the pellet. In addition , the outer pellet structures were analysed 
under the microscope by cross sections of selected pellets.
 
 Compared to shake flask cultures, in stirred bioreactors (4.5 l) the 
lcc1 transformant  was 
cultivated at 37 °C and the pH of the medium was controlled. Laccase activity was very low at pH 8 with values of 0.5 after 6 days of cultivation, whereas at pH 7 and pH 6 activities of 1.1 and 1.3 U/ml were reached, respectively.  In shake flask cultures (100 ml), the 
lcc1 transformant  and the control transformant, both 
differed in pellet morphology when growing at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. At 25 °C, pellets had a smooth surface, whereas at 37 °C pellets had a hairy appearance. At the lower temperature, pellets were more compact than pe llets grown at the cultivation temperature of 
37 °C. The outer layer of pellets formed at 25 °C consists of small densely aggregated cells. The inner medulla is formed by loosely aggregated hyphae that during aging appear to degenerate. The inner medulla of pellets grown at 37 °C was similar to pellets derived at 
25 °C, whereas the cells of the outer layer are less dense aggregated. Generally, the outer layers of pellets from 37 °C are wider than the one of pellets grown at 25 °C.  In automated image analysis of both transforma nts, the projected pellet area varied between 
1 to 10 mm
2, whereas also smaller fragments and pelle ts were present. Most pellets of the 
lcc1 transformant were in the range of 3 to 5 mm2 and most pellets of the control Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 137transformant in the range of 2 to 4 mm2, respectively. In all cultures, the pellet diameter 
changed over the time. The diameter of pelle ts levelled at 1.5 to 2.5 mm for the control 
transformant from day 8 of the cultivation onwards. For the lcc1 transformant, the diameter 
balanced after 6 days in a range of 2.0 to 3.0 mm. 
 In bioreactor cultures, pellet morphology was much more variable in sizes ranging from 
smaller pellets and fragments (< 0.4 mm
2) to very large pellets (> 20 mm2). Pellet size was 
influenced by the pH, at pH 6 and pH 7 most pellets showed an average projected area of around 7 to 12 mm
2 and pellets grown at pH 8 of around 3 to 5 mm2. The outer appearance 
of the pellets in the stirred bi oreactor resembled those obtained in shake flask cultures at 
37 °C.   
B. Introduction 
In nature, laccases occur in fungi, plants an d insects (Mayer and Staples 2002), and also in 
bacteria (Claus 2003). Laccases are multi-co pper oxidases that oxidise phenolic and a 
number of other organic compounds. Because of their wide substrate range, laccases are interesting enzymes for various biotechnological applications in the food, the textile and the 
pulp and paper industries, in soil bioremed iation and in wood composite production 
(chapter 1 and Hüttermann et al. 2001, Couto and Toca-Herrera 2006, Riva 2006, Widsten and Kandelbauer 2008).   For native laccase production, fungal strains are selected that are most efficient in secretion of enzymes. Generally, native laccases are won from basidiomycetes in  liquid cultures which 
are treated with suitable inducers for improvin g enzyme production (e.g. copper, ethanol, 
2,5-xylidine and other phenolic compounds) (Lomascolo et al. 2003, Tavares et al. 2005, Jang et al. 2006, Myasoedova et al. 2008). Al so other cultivation parameters can increase 
natural laccase production, as it was shown for 
Pleurotus ostreatus  and Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium  in shake flask cultures where increased agitation speed resulted in higher 
laccase yield (Michel et al. 1990, Hublik and Schinner 2000). Nevertheless, shake flask 
cultures may be suboptimal for production of enzymes from aerobic organisms, since aeration is limited due to a restricted liquid/air interphase. In contrast, in stirred bioreactors, 
highly dispersed bubbles of compressed air or 100% oxygen lead to a better aeration. Thus 
and because of the limiting cultivation volume in  shake flask cultures, fermentation in stirred 
bioreactors is preferred in industrial production  processes. An industrial scale production of 
native laccase in a stirred bioreactor was first described for the white-rot fungus Chapter 3 
 138 Trametes versicolor  (Polyporus versicolor ) more than 25 years ago (Fåhraeus and 
Reinhammar 1967, Kharazipour 1983). Since then, several studies on industrial scale 
production of laccases either in submerged (SmF) or in solid state fermentation (SSF) were published (reviewed by Couto and Toca-Herrera 2007). Although highest laccase activities in 
bioreactor scale exceed 700 U/ml (Table 1) , yields are still not high enough for best 
economic industrial production. Besides, the used basidiomycetes grow slow and are 
restricted to the laccases secreted natively by the fungus. Overexpression of these laccases 
in fungi upon gene transformation is an alte rnative way for high-level enzyme production 
(Kilaru 2006).  
 In this study, expression of the 
C. cinerea  laccase Lcc1 under control of a foreign promoter 
(the gpdII -promoter of Agaricus bisporus ) in shake flask and bioreactor cultures was 
observed. Beside standard parameters, such as  enzyme activities, biomass dry weights and 
glucose concentrations, I analysed morphologica l alterations of fungal pellets including the 
inner structure of fungal pellets as ob tained in shake flask cultures of a lcc1 transformant  
and a control transformant not expressing laccase. On a more technical scale, the lcc1 
transformant was grown in a 5 l bioreactor, where different constant pH values were tested for their influence on laccase production and fu ngal morphology. To my knowledge, this is 
the first study observing the morphology of 
C. cinerea  in liquid shake flasks or stirred 
bioreactor cultures.   
C. Material and Methods 
1. Fungal cultures 
A monokaryotic C. cinerea  strain (FA2222) transformed wit h the pYSK7 plasmid expressing 
the laccase gene lcc1 from C. cinerea under control of the  gpdII -promoter of A. bisporus  and 
a control transformant (pCc1001) were used (K ilaru et al. 2006). The clone with the highest 
laccase activity in liquid culture (known as cl one 26 in Kilaru 2006) was used throughout the 
study.  Fungi were grown on YMG-agar (per litre: 4 g yeast; 10 g malt extract; 4 g glucose; 10 g agar) plates at 37 °C until the mycelium reached the border of the petri dish. Sterile water (ddH
2O) was poured onto the plate and the mycelium with the asexual spores was scraped 
with a sterile spatula from the agar. The spore solution was filtered using a sterile funnel filled with glass wool in order to hold back  the fungal hyphae. A Thoma counting chamber 
was used to determine the spore concentration in the solution.  Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 139For shake flask cultures, a pre-culture with 106 spores/ml medium were prepared in 500 ml 
flasks, filled with 50 ml of modified Kjalke me dium (Kjalke et al. 1992) per litre: 10 g yeast, 
20 g glucose, 0.5 g CaCl 2 x 2H 2O, 2 g KH 2PO4, 50 mg MgSO 4 x 7H 2O. The inoculated flasks 
were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C as statio nary (standing) cultures. The pre-culture was 
homogenised by an Ultra-Turrax® (IKA Werke GmbH & Co. KG, Staufen, Germany) for 30 
sec at 8000 rpm and for 30 sec at 9500 rpm (r otations per minute). For the main-culture, 
500 ml flasks with 100 ml of sterile Kjalke medium supplemented with 0.1 mM CuSO 4 were 
inoculated with each 5 ml of the homogenised pre-culture. Cultivatio n took place at 25 °C 
and 37 °C on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm. 
 Bioreactor cultures were performed in a New Br unswick Scientific 5 l st irred vessel bioreactor 
(New Brunswick, Edison, NJ, USA; Fig. 1). The fermenter was filled with 4.5 litre of modified 
Kjalke medium (per litre: 10 g yeast, 20 g glucose, 0.1 g CaCl
2 x 2H 2O, 1.5 g KH 2PO4, 50 mg 
MgSO 4 x 7H 2O) supplemented with 0.1 mM CuSO 4 and inoculated with the spores to a final 
amount of 106 spores/ml. Cultivation took place at 37 °C and 120 rpm at pH 6, pH 7 and 
pH 8.

2. Determination of the dry weight (DW) in gr am per litre [g/l] 
Following growth, volumes of the fungal cultures were measured and the liquid was poured 
into a Büchner funnel containing a cellulose f ilter of known dry weight. The filters together 
with the wet biomass were dried at 80 °C and the dry weights were determined.

L a c c a s e  a c t i v i t y  w a s  d e t e r m i n e d  i n  1 0 0  m M  sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at room 
temperature with ABTS (2,2‘-azino-bis [3-ethyl benzthiazoline-6-sulfon ate], AppliChem GmbH, 
Darmstadt, Germany) as a substrate. The conv ersion of the substrate was observed with the 
help of a spectrophotometer (DU 800, Beckma n Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) at 420 nm ( ε = 
36000 M–1 cm-1) (Matsumura et al. 1986). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the 
amount of substrate in µmol transformed per mi n and enzymatic activities are given in U per 
volume. 
 
4. Glucose determination 
The glucose concentration was determined indi rectly with the Glucose (HK) Assay Kit from 
Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Muni ch, Germany). Glucose was enzymatically 
phosphorylated and afterwards oxidised with NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) to 
6-phosphogluconate. During the oxidation, NAD is reduced to NADH, which correlates 
directly with the glucose concentration and which was measured at 340 nm with a 
spectrophotometer. Glucose standards (Sig ma, G 3285) were measured with the same 
method in concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, 0. 25, 0.125 and 0.0625 g/l, respectively. The 
supernatant samples of the fungal cultures were diluted to fit in the NADH absorption curve 
for the glucose standards. 
 
5. C/N determination of culture supernatant 
Tin capsules (HEKAtech GmbH, Wegberg, Ge rmany) were weighted and filled with an 
adequate amount of supernatant (40-120 µl to reach ~800 ng dry weight/capsule). The tin 
capsules with the supernatant were lyophilised , weight again and analysed with a CHNS-O 
elemental analyser (Carlo Erba Instruments, EA 1108-Elemental Analyzer, Milan, Italy) 
according to the instruct ions of the supplier. 
 
6. Morphological observation 
Pelleted growth was observed and analysed using an automated image analysis system 
described earlier in this study (section 3.IV, Rühl and Kües 2009). For shake flask cultures, 
pellets were clustered in distinct groups ac cording to their pellet area (0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 
0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0, 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, 13 -15, 15-17, 17-19, 19-21, 21-23, 
23-25 mm2) and, additionally, according to th eir convexity (0.50-0.525, 0.525-0.55, Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 1410.55-0.575, …, 0.975-1.00) and diameter (0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-1.5, …, 9.5-10.0) by using the 
automated image analysis system. The pellet concentration (pellets per culture) was 
determined as well. 
In bioreactor cultures, the pellets were clustered according to their projected pellet area into broader groups, due to inhomogeneous growth among the fermentation runs at constant pH 7 (0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0,  1-3, 3-5, 5-9, 9-13, 13-17, 17-21, 21-25, 25-
50 mm

7. Embedding of mycelium pellets into Roti®-Plast  
(Fa. Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) 
Around 10 mycelial pellets were collected per fungal liquid culture per day of incubation and 
fixed in FAE solution (100 ml contain 90 ml of 70% ethanol (EtOH), 5 ml of acetic acid and 5 
ml of 37% formaldehyde) followed by several em bedding steps. The pellets rested at least 
for 4 h at room temperature (RT) in the following chemicals: 70% EtOH, 80% EtOH, 90% EtOH, 96% EtOH, 96% EtOH/isopropanol 1:1, isopropanol, isopropanol/Roti
®-Histol 3:1, 
isopropanol/Roti®-Histol 1:1, isopropanol/Roti®-Histol 1:3, 3 times pure Roti®-Histol, 
saturated Roti®-Plast in Roti®-Histol  for at least 8 h, saturated Roti®-Plast in Roti®-Histol at 
40 °C for at least 12 h, 3 times pure melted Roti®-Plast at 60 °C for at least 12 h. The 
embedded pellets were fixed onto a wooden bl ock, trimmed to fit in the microtome and 
10 µm cuttings were performed with a rotary  microtome (R. Jung, Heidelberg, Germany). 
The cuttings were put onto a gelatinised micros cope slide and washed three times with pure 
Roti®-Histol, once with isopropanol/Roti®-Histol 1:1 and twice with pure isopropanol for at 
least 5 min each. At the end, the slides were stored at RT for evaporation of the isopropanol and pictures were taken with a binocular (Stemi 2000-C, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen) for analysis of the cross section.  
D. Results 
1. Cultural growth and laccase production at 25 °C and 37 °C 
The laccase producing lcc1 transformant and the control tran sformant were inoculated into 
modified Kjalke medium and cultivated in parallel at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. 
Biomass (DW) production, glucose consumption and nitrogen consumption (C/N ratio) followed the same general pattern for the 
lcc1 transformant and the control transformant at 
25 °C, respectively at 37 °C (Fig. 2 A, B and C). Growth at 25 °C was delayed compared to Chapter 3 
 142 growth at 37 °C, in accordance to the optimal growth temperature of the fungus (Kües 
2000). DW values of ~ 1 g/l were reached at day 2 of cultivation for the lcc1 transformant in 
25 °C and 37 °C cultures and of ~ 3 g/l for the control transformant in 25 °C and 37 °C cultures at day 4 of cultivation, respectively (F ig. 2A). Until day 6, th e controls had slightly 
higher dry weights compared to the 
lcc1 transformant. All cultures reached their maximum 
DW of around 8-10 g/l at day 6 of cultivation. Afterwards, the biomass declined in the 
cultures at 37 °C with DW values of 7 and 5 g/l at days 8 and 10 of cultivation, respectively. 
At 25 °C, from day 6 to day 8 the DW of both strains remained high with a slight increase for the 
lcc1 transformant culture that reached at day 8 a maximum biomass DW of 9 g/l. 
Afterwards, the biomass slowly declined (Fig. 2A). Along with biomass production, glucose was consumed  in the first 6 days of cultivation in all 
control cultures, irrespectively of temperature. Glucose in 
lcc1 transformant cultures was also 
fully depleted at day 6 in cultures grown at 37 °C, whereas at 25 °C the glucose was fully depleted at day 8 of cultivation (Fig. 2B). The C/N ratios in the cultures followed exactly the glucose concentration curves. At day 6, respectively day 8 of cultivation, the C/N-ratio levelled down to about 4 which was subsequently kept for the rest of the cultivation period. 
Generally, the 37 °C cultures showed a more drastic decrease in the glucose concentration compared to the 25 °C cultures. This again is reflected in the C/N-ratio which decreased 
faster at 37 °C (Fig. 2C).  
Along with biomass production, as well as C an d N consumption, laccase activity in the 
supernatant increased in comparable manner at the temperatures of 25 °C and 37 °C until 
day 6, in both cases to a level of about 3 U/ml. In the next 4 days, the activity at 37 °C 
decreased continuously to final levels below 0.3 U/ml. In contrast, the 25 °C cultures 
reached their maximum activities of around 9 U/ml at day 8 of cultivation. For comparison, the control transformant showed no measurable activity at 37 °C, but reached activities of 
about 3 U/ml at day 6 in 25 °C comparable to the 
lcc1 transformant activities at 37 °C 
(Fig. 2D). The initial pH of the Kjalke medium (pH 6.0) decreased in all cultures until day 4, when 
values of pH 5.0 to 5.5 where reached. Subs equently, when highest biomass values were 
obtained (Fig. 2A), a dramatic increase of the pH was observed at day 6 (pH 7.8) in the 37 °C cultures and final values of almost pH 9 occurred at day 10. The 25 °C cultures showed a slightly delayed increase in the pH of the supernatant from day 6 onwards. Values 
of around pH 7 were observed at day 8 and a final pH of around 8 was reached at day 10 of cultivation (Fig. 2C). A dire ct correlation to enzymatic activities is not seen.  Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures

three parallel cultures. 
 
Pellet formation was also followed up in the cultures. Here, unlike tota l biomass production, 
pellet concentration differed drastically between the transformants, but not as much as 
between the two different temperatures a strain was cultured at. Pellet concentration reached amounts of 3000 and 2200 pellets per culture from day 6 onwards for the 
lcc1 
transformant at 25 °C and 37 °C, respective ly. More than 4000 pellets per culture were 
obtained for the control transformant at both cultivation temperatures (Fig. 2F). 024681012

 144 In 25 °C cultures irrespectively of the strain used, the pellet amount increased slightly over 
the time until day 10, whereas pellet concentration of cultures of both transformants at 37 °C had their maximum levels at day 6 of cu ltivation. Pellet amounts slightly decreased 
from day 6 onwards until the end of the cultivation. Highest pe llet numbers in 25 °C cultures 
of the 
lcc1 transformant correlated with highest biomass and highest enzyme production, 
whereas such a correlation at 37 °C with the generally lower enzymatic yield was not 
obvious, in terms of enzymatic activity.  
2. Pellet morphology in shake flask cultures 
Fungal growth and pellet form ation in cultures of the lcc1 transformant and the control 
transformant was followed up over the time by automated image analysis as described earlier (section 3.III, Rühl and Kües 2009). Selected photographs of the pellets in the culture supernatants are shown in Fig. 3. For both tr ansformants, the growth at 25 °C was generally 
more homogenous than the growth at 37 °C.  At 25 °C at the initial phase of growth at day 2 of cultivation, for bo th transformants pellets 
were small of irregular fringy  shape and had a loosely aggregated, thin mycelium. With 
prolonged cultivation time at day 4 of cultivat ion, pellets reached round and sometimes oval 
shapes. At day 6 of cultivation, the pellets of both transformants showed the highest density throughout the cultivation as can be deduced from their intransparent look in the photographs. Until the end of the cultivation,  the pellets retained their round and oval 
shapes, but reduced in their overall density as is documented by the lighter grey shading of 
pellets in the photographs (Fig. 3, 25 °C).  
At 37 °C, both transformants produced already large and dense pellets at day 2 at the beginning of the cultivation. However from day 4 onwards, high amounts of free mycelium (hyphal fragments) were present in the supernatant cultures. In cultures of the control transformant, the amount of hyphal fragments seemed to be higher than in cultures of the 
lcc1 transformant (Fig. 3, 37 °C). Along wit h producing masses of mycelium fragments, 
overall, the density of the pellets in both transformants reduced much more drastically at 37 °C at the end of the cultivation than in the 25 °C cultures as indicated by the more light 
pellet colours in the photographs taken on day 8 and day 10 of cultivation, respectively (Fig. 3).  Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures

Fig. 3  Photographs of pellets in the supernatant from the lcc1 transformant and the control transformant 
cultivated at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively, in modified Kjalke medium. Scale bars in the lower right corner of the 
images indicate 20 mm in size.  
 
In order to characterise pellet morphologies in more detail, in total about 800-1200 pellets 
per transformant, culture condition and day of cultivation were characterised by automated image analysis. The study revealed that the dist ribution of the projected pellet area of the 
pellets showed differences in size. At 25 °C, af ter 2 days of cultivation most of the pellets 
derived from 
lcc1 transformant cultures covered a projected area of 1-3 mm2, whereas 
pellets of the control transformant were smalle r with most of them having a projected area 
below 0.4 mm2  (Fig. 4). At 37 °C after 2 days of cultivation, the pellets reached already a 
size of 1-5 mm2 and 3-7 mm2 in control and in lcc1 transformant cultures, respectively 
(Fig. 4).   Over the whole cultivation time, small pellets  and loosely aggregated hyphal fragments 
covering a projected area lower than 0.2 mm
2, which were not excluded from pellet raw data 
by the automated image analysis system (secti on 3.III, Rühl and Kües 2009), were present 
in all cultures. At 37 °C, hi ghest amounts of these small pellets and loosely aggregated 
hyphal fragments were reached from day 4 onwa rds. Their fraction on the detected pellets 
was almost 25% at day 4 and 50% at day 6 for the lcc1 transformant and control 
transformant, respectively. With prolonged cult ivation time, the amount of small pellets and 
loosely aggregated hyphal fragments increased slowly up to 10% and 25% also in the 25 °C cultures at day 10 for the 
lcc1 transformant and control transformant, respectively (Fig. 4, Chapter 3 
 146 left row). However at both temp eratures and for both strains, most pellets were larger than 
0.2 mm2 with the projected area mostly in the range of 1-5 mm2. Generally, the lcc1 
transformant cultures had slightly larger pe llets than the control transformant with the 
maximum amount of pellets having  a projected area between 3-7 mm2 with average values 
between 4.8 and 6.0 mm2 from day 4 of cultivation on wards. Pellets from control 
transformant cultures had smaller average areas with values of 2.2 to 4.7 mm2 (Table 1, Fig. 
4). Overall, the lcc1 transformant at 37 °C showed a more diverse distribution of the 
projected pellet area in a range of 1-10 mm2 with a high number of smaller pellets or loosely 
aggregated hyphal fragments (< 0.2 mm2) until day 6 (Fig. 4). Generally, the results on the 
projected pellet areas are reflected in the data on pellet diameters. 
 When analysing the pellet diameter, pellets at 25  °C of both transformants at day 2 showed 
a sharp peak of the distribution curve. Most pellets had a diameter of 1.0 mm to 1.5 mm both for the control and for the 
lcc1 transformant. For both transformants, the diameter 
increased to stable values of 2.0-2.5 mm at day 4 and day 6 onwards, whereas at day 10 also smaller fragments with diameters of 0.5-1.0 mm occurred (Fig. 5 left row).  In 37 °C cultures at day 2, larger diameters were reached with peaks at sizes of 0.5-1.0 mm 
and 2.0-2.5 mm for the control tran sformant, and 3.0-3.5 mm for the 
lcc1 transformant. This 
distribution of pellets split into diameters of < 1.0 mm and 2.5-3.5 mm after day 2. The larger pellets (> 1.0 mm) approach over the time with diameters of 1.5-2.5 mm for the control transformant and 2.0-3.0 mm for the 
lcc1 transformant. In contrast similarly to the 
amount of pellets with a smaller projected area, the amount of pellets with smaller diameters 
increased over the time for the control transformant and the lcc1 transformant to values of 
20% and 40% at day 6, respectively (Fig. 5 left row).  Analysing the regularity of the shape of pellets, the convexity of the pellets was very variable at the beginning of cultivation, but sharp pe aks of convexity values  of 0.95-0.975 were 
obtained at the end of cultivation. The 
lcc1 transformant cultures at 25 °C showed a 
somewhat different picture as sharp peaks for values of the convexity were reached already 
after day 4 of cultivation and kept on during further incubation (Fig. 5 right row).

 1493. Micro-morphological analysis of C. cinerea  pellets 
Photographs of pellets taken by a CCD camera attached to a binocular revealed that pellet 
surfaces varied tremendously between 25 °C and 37 °C cultures (Fig. 6). At 25 °C, the pellets of both transformants showed a very  smooth surface area. In contrast, pellets 
derived from cultures at 37 °C had a more hairy look.  
Fig. 6  Photographs of pellets obtained from the lcc1 transformant and control transformant cultures grown at 
25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. Scale bars in the lower right corner indicate 1 mm.  
 To study the outer surface in more detail, we analysed microtome cuttings of pellets. Each second day, average sized pellets from cultures were taken, embedded in paraffin wax and cut into 12 µm slices with a rotary microtome. Slices representing the middle of the pellet (the largest diameter) were photographed using a CCD camera fixed onto a binocular (Fig. 7). The differences between pellets grown at 25 °C and 37 °C are very obvious when 
comparing the microtome cuttings. The pellets of  37 °C cultures already reached their final 
size after 2 days, whereas at 25 °C the final size was reached within 4 days (compare Fig. 4 
and Fig. 7). At the first day of analysis (d ay 2 of cultivation), pellets were uniformly 
structured without an outer zone. While at day 4 of cultivation such a differentiation became 
visible. At 25 °C, the smooth pellets of both transformants have a very dense and small mycelial outer zone (rind) and a less dense i nner region (medulla).  However, the outer Chapter 3 
 150 mycelial ring in pellets from the control tran sformant seems to be less even (Fig. 7). In 
pellets of 37 °C cultures, the outer mycelial zo ne is irregular hairy and seems to be less 
compact than the rind of pellets formed at 25 °C although, generally, the outer zone of 
pellets formed at 37 °C is much broader than those formed at 25 °C (Fig. 7). No obvious differences can be seen between pellets of the 
lcc1 transformant and the control 
transformant of 37 °C cultures. We noticed that pellets from 10 day-old cultures were more 
instable. Thus microtome cuttings were harder to obtain.  
 
Fig. 7  Microtome cuttings of paraffin embedded pellets from lcc1 transformant and control transformant cultures 
grown at 25 °C (upper rows of photos) and 37 °C (lower rows of photos) in modified Kjalke medium, respectively. 
The bar in the lower right part indicates 1 mm. Per day of cultivation and transformant, at least 3 pellets were 
analysed. 
 
To better compare the general structure of pellets from different cultures with each other, a ratio of the width of the outer zone to the complete diameter was calculated. For this purpose, each three photos of microtome cuttings were analysed with the software analySIS
® (Soft Imaging System GmbH, Münster, Germany). Obtained data are presented in 
Fig. 8. Because differentiation into an outer an d an inner zone were only observed from day 
4 onwards, pellets derived from day 2 of cultivation were excluded from the analysis. The ratio width outer zone to diameter did not differ over the time for a strain within a culture or between strains at the same cultivation condition. The ratios fo r both strains were around 5 Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 151for 37 °C over the whole period  of cultivation, with minor di fferences being within the range 
of the standard deviation (4.9 ± 1.1). At 25 °C, the ratios were more than twofold higher 
than at 37 °C with values ranging from 12 to 17 (14.1 ± 3.6).  Although the outer zones in pellets from 25 °C cultures of 
lcc1 transformants appeared to be 
more compact than those of pellets of the control transformant, differences in the ratio (diameter/outer zone) between pellets of the 
lcc1 transformant and pellets of the control 
transformant were marginal for both cultivation temperatures.

 152 4. Laccase production in a stirred bioreactor 
Fermentation of the lcc1 transformant was conducted in a 5 l bioreactor (New Brunswick 
Scientific) at 37 °C and an agitation rate of  120 rpm that was mediated by two six-bladed 
Rushton turbines (Fig. 1). Runs were performed at three different constant pH values: pH 6, 
7 and 8. Until day 3 after inoculation, culture samples were taken via the sampling tube 
twice a day. Afterwards, only one sample was taken every 24 h.  
Up to day 6, the fungus grew in all cultur es in form of pellets and mycelial fragments 
allowing mixing of the cultures by the Rushton turbines of the bioreactor. Afterwards, by the 
increase in biomass and viscosity, growth was non-homogenous due to increased adhesion 
of mycelial hyphae at peripherals of the bioreactor, such as sensors, impellers and aeration pipe (see Fig. 1 for details in bioreactor construction). Therefore, fermentation were stopped at day 6 of cultivation. Generally, an increase in biomass indicated by the dry weight (DW) and laccase yields in the supernatant were achieved with decreasing pH values in the fermentation runs. Thus, highest values in biomass were obtained at pH  6 ,  r e s p e c t i v e l y  l o w e s t  v a l u e s  a t  p H  8 .  
Nevertheless, the biomass curves showed a similar constant increase at all pH values. Highest biomass values of 4.8 ± 0.8, 4.3 ± 0. 4 and 3.3 ± 0.8 g/l were reached for pH 6, 
pH 7 and pH 8, respectively, at day 6 of cultiv ation (Fig. 9A). The laccase activity within the 
supernatant showed a similar increase until day 3 after inoculation. At th is point, the laccase 
activity curve of pH 8 flattens in increase unlike the laccase activity curves at pH 6 and pH 7. At pH 6 and pH 7, laccase activity further in creased with prolonged cultivation time, reaching 
highest activities of 1.3 ± 0.3 and 1.1 ± 0.2 U/ml at day 6 of cultivation. The laccase activity obtained at pH 8 (0.5 ± 0.1 U/ml) was only half the amount than that at pH 6 and pH 7 (Fig. 9B).  Since a constitutive promoter (
gpdII   f r o m  A. bisporus ) was used for the recombinant 
laccase production, a comparison  between the laccase activity and the biomass might show 
effects other than by the biomass itself. Thus, laccase activities per biomass DW values were calculated (Fig. 9C). At the beginning of cultiv ation, the laccase per biomass specific activity 
curves [U/gDW] were alike for all pH values. However, after 3 days of cultivation upon 
reaching a value of 183 ± 72 U/gDW, the curve for the cultivation at pH 8 stopped abruptly in increase in order to slowly  decrease to a final value of 163 ± 26 U/gDW at day 6 of 
cultivation. After day 3 of cultiv ation, biomass specific activities of cultivation at pH 6 and at 
pH 7, in contrast, constantly increased further over the next days and reached their highest values of 296 ± 57 U/gDW and 246 ± 28 U/gDW after 5 and 6 days of cultivation, respectively. Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures

 154 5. Pellet morphology in stirred bioreactor cultures 
Also for cultivation in the 5 l bioreactor, pellet morphology was observed. Per day and 
culture about 15-20 ml solution were harves ted with about 60 to 250 pellets that were 
evaluated per image by automated image analysis . In all fermentations in the 5 l bioreactor, 
pellets of measurable size were first detected af ter 2 days of cultivation.  In the cultures kept 
at constant pH 6, at the beginning almost 40% of the pellets had a projected area of 
1-3 mm2 with an average pellet size of 1.1 mm2 (± 0.9 mm2) (Fig. 10, Table 2). After day 2 
of cultivation, the pellets showed a broader distribution in size of 1-7 mm2 and a smaller 
amount of pellets being in the range of up to 10 mm2. The average pellet area increased 
until day 4 (7.6 ± 4.8 mm2) and changed only marginally until the end of the cultivation 
(7.9 ± 5.7 mm2) (Table 2). From day 4 onwards until the end of the cultivation, also pellets 
with a projected area above 21 mm2 were detected accounting fo r about 10% of all pellets 
per culture (Fig. 10).  
 At pH 7, already at the start of the fermentation there was a different distribution pattern of pellet size as compared to pH 6. At day 2 of cultivation, aver age pellet area was 
3.7 ± 3.5 mm
2 (Table 2). Afterwards, the sizes of the pellet areas varied dramatically with 
most pellets having a projected area in the range of 5-9 mm2 and 13-17 mm2, respectively 
(Fig. 10). Additionally, also very small (< 0.2 mm2) and large (> 21 mm2) pellets were 
detected from day 3 onwards over the whole cult ivation period with up to 21% of the pellets 
at day 5 being larger than 21 mm2. At the end of the fermentation runs, values of the 
average pellet area at pH 7 were similar to values derived at pH 6 with an average projected area of 7.3 ± 11.0 mm
2 at day 6 of cultivation, although values at pH 7 had a much a higher 
standard deviation than at pH 6, because of the overall broad pattern of size distribution.  In fermentation experiments at pH 8, the pellets were smaller than those produced at pH 6 at the beginning of cultivation with values between 1-3 mm
2 that however increased from 
day 3 onwards to a more widespread average projected area of 1-9 mm2 after 4 days, with 
the highest amount of pellets being in the range of 1-3 mm2. Small pellets or loosely 
aggregated hyphal fragments of sizes between 0.2-0.4 mm2 were observed over the whole 
cultivation time, whereas in later stages the amount increased to around 20% at day 5 and 
day 6 of cultivation, respecti vely (Fig. 10). Generally, more  smaller pellets and loosely 
aggregated hyphal fragments occurred at pH 7 and 8, compared to pH 6 (Fig. 10).

E. Discussion  
I n  t h is st u dy ,  t he  ch a ng in g  mo rp ho lo gy  o f  C. cinerea  in modified Kjalke medium in liquid 
shaken and in stirred bioreactor cultures were observed over the time together with enzyme 
production by a recombinant laccase producing strain ( lcc1 transformant) and a control 
transformant without extra laccase gene (pCc1 001). Results show that morphology of fungal 
pellets is influenced by the cultivation temper ature and the pH of the medium. A correlation 
between fungal morphology and laccase secretion was not obvious.  
1. Shake flask cultures: laccase and biomass production 
In shake flask cultures, laccase yields of the lcc1 transformant were highest at 25 °C, 
although part of the enzymatic activities seemed  to derive from natural production of laccase 
as deduced from the low enzymatic activities in the supernatant of the control transformant. In contrast, the control did not produce laccases at the higher temperature of 37 °C unlike the 
lcc1 transformant (Fig. 2). It is thus assumed th at at 37 °C all laccase activity is due to 
recombinant enzyme production. Generally, enzymatic activities were found to be higher at the lower temperature. Best enzymatic yields at both temperatures correlated with high biomass amounts, depletion of glucose in the medi um and a shift in pH from slightly acidic to 
alkaline. The two transformants had comparable growth behaviours with a faster biomass 
production at 37 °C as compared to 25 °C. 
 After 2 days of cultivation, both transformant cultures grown at 37 °C already had 3times higher dry weights compared to the 25 °C cult ures. This faster growth at the beginning of 
the culture might have been due to the required adaptation of the fungus to the lower growth temperature of 25 °C, because the pre-cult ure was solely cultivated at 37 °C. During 
the continuous cultivation in the following 2 days, 
lcc1 transformant and control transformant 
cultures showed an analogous increase in the growth curves (Fig. 2A) at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. Although the maximum biomass dry weight was reached 2 days earlier in Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 157cultures at 37 °C, the maximum dry weight for all temperatures was in the range of 8-10 g/l. 
These findings indicate a longer lag-phase and a lower biomass duplication time at 25 °C 
compared to 37 °C. Accordingly, also depletion of glucose in the cultures showed a 2-days shift between 25 °C and 37 °C cultures, respectively. The depletio n of glucose and highest biomass yields more 
or less coincided with an increase in the pH. Most obvious is the 2-days difference between 
25 °C and 37 °C in change of the pH of the supernatant (Fig. 2E). The shift of ~2 days in 
alkalisation of the medium may derive from a better growth at 37 °C resulting in an active alkalisation of the medium by the higher fungal biomass and in earlier autolysis of the fungus. Analysing laccase production by the control transformant at 25 °C suggests that native laccase is already produced by 
C. cinerea  at lower pH values as hi ghest activity occurred at 
pH 5.7 (Fig. 2D und 2E). Contradictory to this, Hublik and Schinner (2000) reported for 
P. ostreatus  a correlation of laccase production with the pH in the culture supernatant 
r e a c h i n g  m a x i m u m  l a c c a s e  a c t i v i t i e s  a t  p H  8 . 5 .  I n  a n o t h e r  s t u d y ,  t h e  b a s i d i o m y c e t e  
Trametes pubescence  was cultivated in a stirred vessel without controlling the pH. Similar to 
our observation in shake flask cultures of C. cinerea , the pH decreased at the beginning of 
the culture and increased sharply after the glucose got depleted. Herein, the maximum laccase activity was reached at pH 7 for batch an d at pH 5 for fed-batch cultures (Galhaup et 
al. 2002). Thus, laccase activities in 
T. pubescence  seem to depend rather on the glucose 
concentration than on the pH of the cultivat ion medium. How compare such natural laccase 
yields to our results with the recombinant la ccase producer? There was comparable laccase 
activity by the lcc1 transformant prior to day 6 of cultivation at 25 °C and 37 °C, but at 25 °C 
extra laccase activity occurred at day 8 of cultivation (Fig. 2D). Production of the recombinant laccase was und er the control of the 
gpdII -promoter from A. bisporus  believed 
to be a constitutive promoter (Harmsen et al. 1992, Kilaru and Kües 2005). However in the 
lcc1 t r a n s f o r m a n t  a t  2 5  ° C ,  t h e  gpdII -promoter appeared not to behave constitutively. 
Currently, it is unclear whether this is due to the ectopic place of the vector integration into 
the genome of C. cinerea  or due to a failure of appropriate regulation of the A. bisporus  
promoter in the foreign host at 25 °C.   
2. Shake flask cultures: pellet morphology 
Enzymes in filamentous fungi are believed to be secreted by physiologically active hyphal tips 
(Moukha et al. 1993, Conesa et al 2001). Theref ore, it is very reasonable to study fungal 
growth and morphology during cultivation and fermentation. Here, the pellet production and Chapter 3 
 158 morphology was compared between two transformants, one of which recombinantly 
produced laccase.  Clear differences in pellet morphology were visible between different cultivation temperatures and to a less degree also between the two transformants when grown at the same temperature.   
For both transformants, the projected area of  their pellets showed similar sizes at both 
cultivation temperatures. Independently of the temperature, most pellets of the control 
transformant showed a projected area of approximately 3 mm
2 and most pellets of the lcc1 
transformant a projected area of 5 mm2, respectively. One reason for this difference 
between the recombinant laccase producer and th e control is probably the slightly faster 
growth of the control transformant resulting in  a faster increase in total biomass (Fig. 2A) 
and in a higher increase in the amount of pellets  per culture (Fig. 2F). As reported earlier for 
other fungi (Lejeune and Baron 1998, Fang and Zhong 2002), an increase in pellet amount 
may be due to pellet breakage. Already at day 2 of cultivation, independently of the temperature of cultivation, there were about 1200 pellets more in the cultures of the control transformant than in cultures of the 
lcc1 transformant. Although pre-cultures of the 
transformants were handled exactly the same, it  could also have been that a higher number 
of mycelial debris were produced for the control transformant during maceration of the pre-culture. In addition, germination tests on YMG agar plates indicated higher amounts of active spores for the control transformant (9.8 ± 0.8 % germination rate) compared to the 
lcc1 
transformant (5.1 ± 1.5 % germination rate). Al so pre-cultures in modified Kjalke medium 
showed higher biomass yields for the control transformant (4.2 ± 0.4 g/l DW) compared to 
the lcc1 transformant (3.1 ± 0.8 g/l) (experiments not further shown). 
 Maximum pellet size in liquid modified Kjalke medium was reached for both transformants at 
25 °C at day 4 of cultivation and at 37 °C at day 2 of cultivation, respectively (Fig. 4). After the increase of pellet diameter and projected area at 25 °C until day 4, both parameters were more or less stable over the whole cultiv ation period of both transformants. A similar 
behaviour was reported for the triterpene producer 
Ganoderma lucidum when the fungus 
was cultivated in shake flask cultures in a complex medium based on sucrose as C-source. 
Also in this study, the distribution of pellet diameter increased during the first 4 days and was subsequently quite stable over the rest of the culture (Fang and Zhong 2002).   At 37 °C, most pellets reached their final size after 2 days, whereas the biomass and the pellet concentration still in clined until day 4 and day 6 for the control and the 
lcc1 Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 159transformant, respectively. In addition to the higher number of pellets which may account 
for the elevated biomass yield, the increase in dry weight is probably also due to the more dense and packed nature of the pellets at day 4 compared to day 2 of cultivation. These morphological differences can be seen in the microtome sections of pellets grown at 37 °C (Fig. 7). Pellets showed a much thicker outer zone after 4 days of cult ivation, compared to 
pellets derived from 2 day-old cultures. This outer zone, present from day 4 onwards, were 
found in 25 °C and 37 °C cultures, although the outer zone at 25 °C was generally smaller and seemed to be denser than those formed in pellets at 37 °C.   Another difference is the surface of the pellet s, which can be divided into smooth and hairy 
pellets at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. A similar effect of temperature on the morphology was also reported for 
Rhizopus nigricans , showing a smooth growth at 19 °C and a fluffier 
one at 23 °C (Žnidarsic et al. 2000). The reason for this might be a reduced growth rate at the lower temperature and, thus, the actual surface is relatively more influenced over the time by the shear forces. Nevertheless, a sufficient explanation is not known.   To be sure that the morphological phenotypes of the outer zone were not specific to the used 
C. cinerea  transformant, in ongoing research we tested so fa r 4 additional recombinant 
lcc1 expressing clones (clone 3, 23, 32 and 35). The clones were cultivated at 37 °C and 
every second day from day 4 onwards pellets were embedded and cross sections with the microtome were produced (Fig. 11).  Superficically in the cuttings,  there were no differences 
between the strains but between the age of the cultures in producing the more compact outer rind only later in cultivation (from day 4 of cultivation, Fig. 11). The ratios of outer 
zones to pellet diameters were calculated as described above at day 4, day 6 and day 8 (Fig. 12). Once an outer rind was formed the ratios  (pellet diameter/width outer zone) varied 
marginally with values between 2.8 and 4.6 giving an average over all clones of 3.6 ± 0.7. Also in this experiment of comparing more 
C. cinerea  clones, complete microtome cuttings 
for observation of the ratio between outer and inner zone could not be obtained for pellets derived after 10 days, due to instability of the pellets at this stage of growth. Further work 
will need to evaluate the format ion of the outer zone in cult ures incubated at 25 °C.  Chapter 3

4 days (white bar), 6 days (light gay) and 8 days (dark gr ey) of cultviation. The error bars indicate the standard 
deviation of three different pellet cross sections. 
 
To describe the outer surface or form of the pellets without cross sections, definition of the convexity might help. Cox and Thomas (1992) analysed the convex area ratio with values of 0.9 for smooth pellets and 0.5 fo r hairy pellets in cultures of 
A. niger . When comparing the 
Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 161convexity of the pellets derived from shake flask cultures (Fig. 5) with the microtome 
cuttings of the pellet (Fig. 7), it becomes clear that there is a connection between convexity 
and hariness of the pellet. Pellets of the lcc1 transformant grown at 25 °C cultures had a 
smooth surface and also a high convexity value, whereas pellets from 37 °C cultures showed 
a lower convexity throughout the cultivation. Although, in ou r study the convexity decreased 
with prolonged cultivation time, differentiates from the Aspergillus niger  pellets described in 
the study of Cox and Thomas (1992). The A. niger  pellets showed a more hairy look at the 
end of the cultivation and, thus, a lower conv exity. This might be due to shear forces 
fractioning the outer hairy parts of the pellets, as can be deduced from the microtome cuttings (Fig. 7 and Fig. 11).   
3. Fermentation in a stirred bioreactor 
When cultivating basidiomycete fungi in liquid medium, an expanded lag phase can result in 
a whole batch process of several weeks (Fazenda et al. 2008). In this study with C. cinerea , 
we used a very fast growing basidiomycete, wh ich completely colonised the bioreactor in less 
than one week from spore inoculum. Upon inoculation of a fermenter with spores, one can distinguish as phases of cultivation: i) phases  of spore agglomeration, ii) phases of spore 
germination and iii) phases of growth (Grimm  et al. 2004, Kelly et al. 2006). In the 
experiment with 
C. cinerea  cultivated in the Kjalke medium described here, the biomass dry 
weight was more or less similar at the beginni ng of the measurement (day 2) for all three 
different pH values tested. Thus, agglomeration of C. cinerea  spores, which were used for 
inoculation, might have been similar at all tested pHs. In contrast, for Aspergillus oryzae  it 
was reported that spore agglomeration is more intense at higher pH values resulting in pellet like growth, whereas at a lower pH filamentous growth is favo urable due to germination of 
freely dispersed spores (Carlsen et al. 1996). Howe ver in this study, we did not quantify the 
germination rate of the 
C. cinerea  spores at different pH values. This might be one point to 
consider in future fermentation studies.   Compared to the shaken cultures, the final bi omass dry weights per volume of medium of 
the bioreactor cultures were lo wer, which might be due to prob lems related to cultivation in 
the bioreactor, such as a low stirring speed leading to reduced oxygen concentration in the medium, lower shearing stress and an uneven mixing of the culture broth, and clumping of the mycelium around the bioreactor peripheral s leading to oxygen undersupply of cells. 10
6 
spores per ml final volume were applied in stir red bioreactor cultures as inoculum. Reducing Chapter 3 
 162 spore amounts might help to solve the growth problem and, further on, may result in higher 
laccase yields.  In shake flask cultures, homogenised pre- cultures, which were inoculated with 10
6 spores/ml 
final medium and grown for 4 days, were used for the main culture. In future fermentation studies in stirred bioreactors,  pre-cultures similar to the ones applied in shake flask 
experiments will be used unlike the direct inoculation with spores used in this study for 
bioreactor cultures. 
 The laccase activity per volume and biomass varied to a high degree over the tested range of pH values. pH 6 seems to be the better than pH 7 and pH 8 among the tested values for production of recombinant laccase Lcc1 by the used 
lcc1 transformant. At day 6 of cultivation 
in the bioreactor in medium at pH 6, the la ccase activity reached 1.3 U/ml which was more 
than 2times lower than in shaken cultures. Fermentation was interrupted prior of reaching the stationary phase, due to blocking of the peripherals and clumping of the mycelium. Higher activities in stirred bioreactors might have been achieved at a later time point. However, to increase biomass and laccase yields, the impeller diameter can be raised or a higher stirring speed can be used. Analogously to the results with 
C. cinerea  from the studies 
here, Hess et al. (2002) observed a decrease in the laccase activity of Trametes multicolor  
grown in a stirred bioreactor cultures compared  to shake flask cultures. The authors stated 
that the decrease may be due to shear stress of the stirrer or morphological changes in the growth of the fungus (Hess et al. 2002). In 
C. cinerea  cultures of the lcc1 transformant 
cultivated at pH 8, in contrast the situation appears to be very difficult. Laccase production compared to available biomass was relatively well at the first 3 days of cultivation, but 
afterwards there was no further increase but a low gradual decrease. Currently it is not 
known whether the 
gpdII -promoter activity is negatively affected by pH 8 or the protein 
secretion, a high protease activity , lower laccase stability or others.  
 As in shake flask cultures, growth occurred predominantly in form of pellets and no or little free filamentous growth was observed in biorea ctor cultures, although smaller aggregated 
hyphal fragments were present in the stirred vesse l at all pH values. By increasing the stirrer 
speed a more filamentous growth form might be achieved by suppressing pellet growth and/or fragmentation of hyphal filaments, as it was shown for 
A. niger . Increased power 
input via stirring resulted in a lower biomass pr oduction, but higher respiration of the fungus 
(El-Enshasy et al. 1999). Nevertheless, pellet form ation might be better for the production of 
specific metabolites. Pellet formation can be positively influenced by various factors such as different bioreactor constructs, pH, inoculum and detergents (Vecht-Lifshitz et al. 1990 in Morphology of Coprinopsis cinerea  in submerged cultures  
 163Hess et al. 2002). In this study, we showed that the pH had an influence on the morphology 
of C. cinerea , where at the higher pH value a more fragmented growth was observed 
compared to the lower pH value. In the pH 8 cultures, laccase yields were lower, but 
currently we do not know whet her this was due to suppression  of pellet in favour to the 
filamentous growth form. Whatsoev er, pellets are formed in cult ures in bioreactors at pH 6 
and 7 and the higher production rate of the recombinant laccase Lcc1 makes cultivation at 
lower pH values (pH 6 and pH 7) not to be more adequate than at pH 8. Pellets derived from pH 6 and pH 7 cultures had similar average projected areas of 7.9 and 7.3 mm
2, 
respectively, at the end of the fermentation, whereas the average pellet area at pH 8 was only 4.4 mm
2. In contrast to growth at pH 6, pellet distribution at pH 7 in the different runs 
differed from each other with a high standard deviation of the average pellet areas showing 
that the pattern of pellet formation at pH 7 differs from the one at pH 6.   More input is needed to understand the process of bioreactor cultures of 
C. cinerea 
regarding its growth and morpho logical characteristics.

 173I. Secretion of natural laccases in Coprinops is cinerea  
A. Abstract 
Basidiomycetes as main producers for laccases in nature secrete various forms of this type of 
phenoloxidase under different environmental conditions being either laccase isoforms encoded by the same gene or isoenzymes encoded by different laccase genes. The homobasidiomycete 
Coprinopsis cinerea for example has seventeen different laccase genes. 
 In this work, ten monokaryotic 
C. cinerea  strains were studied fo r their ability to produce 
laccases in two different media at 25 °C and 37 °C. For nine strains, laccase activity was increased at 25 °C compared to 37 °C. Yields of up to 1 U/ml and above were achieved for seven strains when cultivated at 25 °C in the glucose-based modified Kjalke medium. A zymogram of the supernatants of these strain s resulted in a total of 10 different bands 
indicating different isoenzymes and/or differen t isoforms of laccases to be produced by the 
different strains. By analysis of the different bands via LC-MS/MS five different isoenzymes were detected: Lcc1, Lcc2, Lcc5, Lcc9 and Lcc10. Based on the zymogram, Lcc1 and Lcc5 were expressed in all of the strains, whereas Lcc2, Lcc9 and Lcc10 occurred only in three 
strains. These findings are discussed according to the effect of cultivation conditions and 
genetic background of strains in comparison to other studies, wher e different isoenzyme 
patterns of basidiomycetes were observed.   
B. Introduction 
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2, benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase) are phenoloxidases capable of oxidising phenolic and aromatic compounds (Leonowicz et al. 2001). In nature, they are 
widespread in the fungal kingdom particularly in the basidiomycetes, but they also occur in plants, insects and bacteria (Claus 2004). In high er fungi, laccase genes often occur in larger 
families (Hoegger et al. 2004), coding for di fferent isoenzymes (Bollag and Leonowicz 1984). 
Such paralogous laccase genes can be different ially regulated (Palmieri et al. 1997, Faraco 
2009). Basidiomycete laccases are probably the most studied phenoloxidases with respect to their production, biochemical characteristics and potential biotechnological use (Baldrian 2006, Kilaru 2006). However, up to now, only a few applications are marketable (section 1.II), amongst other reasons likely due to the generally too low production yields of active enzymes. Chapter 4 
 174 To increase the yield of laccase(s) in liquid cultures of native fungal strains, several 
strategies can be performed. One widely used method is the screening for high producing 
wildtype strains of white-rot fungi, which are known to secrete naturally detectable amounts 
of laccases (Herpoel et al. 2000, Lomasc olo et al. 2002, Myasoedova et al. 2008). 
Additionally, optimisation of culture conditio ns (aeration, agitation, medium, pH, T) to 
improve laccase production is ma inly studied in white-rot fungal cultures (Pointing et al. 
2000, Arora and Gill 2001, Hou et al. 2004, Prasad et al. 2005, Dong et al. 2005, D'Souza et al. 2006, Tavares et al. 2006). Further strategies  include the usage of detergents (Pointing et 
al. 2000, Lomascolo et al. 2002) as well as induci ng substances, such as copper (Palmieri et 
al. 2000, Tavares et al. 2005) and other more complex compounds (2,5-x ylidine, ferulic acid, 
vanilin, violuric acid) (D'Souza et al. 1999, Herpoel et al. 2000, De Souza et al. 2004, Kollmann et al. 2005). Lignocellulosic substanc es, such as cotton stalk, wheat bran, wood 
and other waste materials of the agricultural, forestral and food indu stry, which are general 
substrates for white-rot fungi,  may also act as inducers (Ardon et al. 1996, Arora and Gill 
2001, Stajic et al. 2006). The inducing effects of the lignocellulosic based media components 
and the inducing compounds on native laccase secretion result in normally more than one 
enzyme secreted in the culture broth: in some 
Trametes  species 20 different isoenzymes 
and/or isoforms of the individual laccas es were detected (Dong et al. 2005) and Pleurotus  
strains also produce several laccase is oenzymes (Palmieri et al. 1997).   
Besides in cultures of the wood-degrading basidiomycetes, also in liquid cultures of 
saprotrophic litter degraders laccase activity can be found, such as described for six strains of the ink cap species 
Coprinus  sp. (Ikehata et al. 2004). Recently, Anh et al. (2007) tested 
20 Coprinus  species, of which two ( Coprinus radians  and Coprinus verticillatus ) produced 
laccase under non-inducing culture conditions. Another ink-cap mushroom, the homobasidiomycete 
Coprinopsis cinerea , has 17 different laccase genes divided into two 
gene subfamilies (Kilaru et al. 2006a). Native prod uction of laccase during different stages of 
growth and development in Coprinopsis cinerea  on solid medium was studied by Navarro-
González (2008), but not in liquid shaken cultures with complex medium and inducing 
compounds. In this study, the effect of medium and temp erature on the laccase production by several 
monokaryotic strains of 
C. cinerea  in liquid shaken culture is presented. Differences in the 
overall laccase activity in the supernatant and in the isoenzym pattern were observed. 
Laccases found in cultures with high enzyme yield and high expressed bands were identified 
by LC-MS/MS.

Fungi were grown on solid YMG/T medium (per litre: 4 g yeast extract; 10 g malt extract; 10 g glucose; 0.1 g tryptophan; 10 g agar was added for solidification) at 37 °C. For a 
preculture, ten mycelial agar plugs of Ø 6 mm were put into a 500 ml flask filled with 50 ml 
of either modified Kjalke (Kjalke et al. 1992, pe r litre: 10 g yeast extract, 20 g glucose, 0.5 g 
CaCl
2 x 2 H 2O, 2 g KH 2PO4, 50 mg MgSO 4 x 7 H 2O) or YMG/T liquid medium. Flasks were 
incubated for 4 days at 37 °C as standing cultures. Afterwards, the preculture was homogenised by an Ultra-Turrax
® (IKA Werke GmbH & Co. KG, Staufen, Germany) for 
around 30 sec at 8000 rpm (rotations per minute) and 30 sec at 9500 rpm. For the main-cultures, 500 ml flasks were filled with 100 ml  of modified Kjalke or YMG/T medium, both 
supplemented with 0.1 mM CuSO
4 and inoculated with 5 ml of a homogenised preculture. 
Cultivation took place at 25 °C or 37 °C on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm. Every day, samples of 1 ml were taken from the shaken culture and stored at -20 °C for further analysis. 
 
2. Laccase activity assay  
Laccase activity was determined in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at room 
temperature with ABTS (2,2‘-azino-bis [3-ethyl benzthiazoline-6-sulfon ate], AppliChem GmbH, 
Darmstadt, Germany). The conv ersion of ABTS was observed spectroscopically at 420 nm 
(ε = 36000 M –1 cm-1) (Matsumura et al. 1986). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 
the amount of substrate in µmol transformed per min and the activities are given in U per 
volume. Chapter 4 
 176 3. SDS-PAGE 
For separation of proteins, polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed with 
4% stacking and 12% resolving gels:  4%: 2.5 ml of 0.5 M Tris pH 6.8, 1.3 ml acrylamide 
(37%), 100 µl 10% (w/v) SDS, 50 µl 10% (w/v) APS (ammonium peroxodisulfate, Sigma-
Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), 10 µl TEMED (N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine, 
Amersham Bioscience AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and filled up to 10ml with dH 2O. 12% : 2.5 ml 
of 1.5 M Tris pH 8.8, 4.0 ml acrylamide (37%), 100 µl 10% (w /v) SDS, 50 µl 10% (w/v) APS, 
5 µl TEMED and filled up to 10ml with dH 2O. 
The unfrozen supernatant samples were conc entrated with a Vivaspin 2 (10.000 MWCO) 
from Sartorius (Sartorius GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). For the zymograms, a protein amount equal to 40 mU of laccase activity per we ll and for Coomassie-stai ned gels the undiluted 
concentrated supernatants were used. The sa mples were mixed 1:1 with the loading buffer 
that contained 0.06 M Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue (w/v). Separation was performed at a constant current of 15 mA until the samples reached the resolving gel and continued at 25 mA for migration of proteins in the resolving gel.   
4. Staining 
For Coomassie staining, gels were fixed in 12%  TCA (trichloracetic acid) (w/v) for at least 
1 h and stained overnight in colloidal Coomassi e solution (10% phosphoric acid (v/v), 10% 
ammonium sulfate (w/v) and 0.12% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 (Serva electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) (w/v) in water/methanol (80/20, v/v) solution. The gels were washed with water until an optimal contrast between bands and the background level were 
reached. For native laccase staining, gels were washed in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and then incubated with 5-10 mM MBTH (3-methyl- 2-benzothiazolinon-hydrazone hydrochloride) 
and 5-10 mM DHPPA (3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid) in the same buffer until the protein 
bands showed up.   Tests showed that SDS in the gels and in the loading buffer had no influence on the detection of native laccase activity in the gels. 
5. Protein identification 
Protein bands of the Coomassie- stained gel were cut with a razo r blade and gel pieces were 
digested as described by Havlis and Shevchenko  (2004) with some modifications. Briefly, gel Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 177pieces were washed twice with water for 15 mi n and subsequently on ce with 50 % ethanol 
for destaining. Gel pieces were dehydrated wit h 100 % acetonitril for 20 min and dried in a 
vacuum centrifuge (Concentrator 5301, Eppendorf, Wesseling-Berzdorf, Germany) for 
10 min. Subsequently the gel pieces we re soaked in 2 µM trypsin in 50 mM 
ammoniumbicarbonate buffer (pH 8) at 4 °C for 1 h and digested for 30 min at 58 °C. 
Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces on a shaker first with 150 µl 5% (v/v) formic 
acid for one hour, followed by two extractions with 150 µl 5 % formic acid, 50% acetonitril. 
Extracts were combined, dried in the vacuum centrifuge to total dryness and stored at -20 °C until further proceeding. For further proce ssing, peptides were dissolved in 15 µl of 5 
% formic acid and 3 times 4 µl were injected to a 12 cm capillary column packed with 3 µm 
paticles of Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ (Dr. Maisch  GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) for peptide 
separation. Analysis of the peptides was pe rformed by ESI-LC-MS (HP 1100 Agilent; Esquire 
3000, Bruker Daltonik). Each sample was analys ed in a mass range of the ion trap from 200 
to 1500 m/z. Analysis of the raw data was done with Daltonic Data Analysis version 3.0 
(Bruker Daltonic GmbH; Bruker Daltonic esquir e 5.0). Proteins were identified by searching 
the data against a database of the annotated genome of 
C. cinerea  using local Mascot 
software (www.matrixscience.co m). The following settings were used for the database 
search: fixed modification: carb amidomethylation; variable modification: oxidation; peptide 
mass tolerance: 1.4 Da; peptid e charge: 1+,2+,and 3+; MS/M S tolerance: 0.4 Da; missed 
cleavages allowed: 1. For final identification and predicted function protein BLAST against NCBI database, PFAM (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/), and Interpro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) were used.  
D. Results 
1. Laccase secretion depends on medium and temperature 
Ten monokaryotic C. cinerea  strains were tested for their ab ility to produce laccase(s) under 
different cultivation parameters in either the complete medium YMG/T or in the complete medium modified Kjalke, both supplemented with 0.1 M CuSO
4, in liquid shaken cultures at 
25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. All strains showed good growth in both media and all cultures were completely grown after 12 days. With the exception of strain 218 (2.28 U/ml) and PG78 
(1.02 U/ml) at 25 °C, laccase production in the rich 
C. cinerea  standard growth medium 
YMG/T was generally very low or not existing (Table 2). Changing the medium to modified 
Kjalke gave reasonable laccase activity yields at 25 °C for all tested strains but monokaryon 
LN118 (Table 2). At the optimal growth temperature for C. cinerea  at 37 °C, laccase Chapter 4 
 178 production for most strains was negligible (Table  2). The highest activities were obtained in 
Kjalke medium at 25 °C with monokaryons AT8 (8.07 U/ml), 306 (3.10 U/ml), FA2222 
(2.94 U/ml) and 218 (2.82 U/ml). Monokaryon LN118 was the only strain that under all 
tested growth conditions failed to produce laccase activities above just detectable levels.   
2. Different isoenzymes account for the laccase activit y of different strains 
Levels of laccase activities of strains 218 and PG78 at 25 °C in modified Kjalke and YMG/T medium were comparable (Table 2) as well as isoenzyme pattern for  the strains in the two 
media – only variations in the strength of minor bands occurred (Fig. 1).

Supernatants from cultures of C. cinerea  monokaryons grown in modified Kjalke medium at 
25 °C that showed laccase activities of about 1 U/ml and higher (Table 2) were concentrated via a Vivaspin tube (10,000 MWCO) up to 30fold and concentrated culture supernatants were loaded for native gel electrophoresis either for establishing a zymogram by detection of 
1234Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 179enzymatic activties (40 mU of laccase activity per well) or for Coomassie staining of the 
complete secretome (25 µl of the concen trated culture supernatant per well).

The zymogram for all strains differed from each other in total number of bands (between 4 and 7), in appearance of bands at different positions within the gel and in strength of bands shared between strains. In total by position, 10 different band types were defined (Fig. 2, 
Table 3). Only two bands (number 8 and 10) were present in all strains. Deduced from the strength of staining, in all strains either on e or both of these bands were major bands of 
laccase activity. In strains 306, AT8 and JV6, band 5, band 6 and band 7 were other main 
bands (Fig. 2). For protein identification for all strains, corresponding bands or regions (where in Coomassie-stained gels no visible band existed) were cut from parallel Coomassie-stained gels and treated with trypsin. Peptides we re eluted from the gel-slices for LC/MS-MS 
and Mascot detection analysis.

 180 The results of the protein identification by LC/MS-MS are shown in Table 4. In the very weak 
band 1, occurring in strains 218, 306, AT8, FA 2222 and H5 (lanes A-E in Fig. 2), no laccase 
could be determined. In band 2 of strain 206 (lane B in Fig. 2), Lcc1 was detected by one 
peptide, and in band 2 of strain H5 (lane E in Fig. 2) two laccases (Lcc1 and Lcc5) were 
detected, whereas for all other strains showing weak activity in the zymogram at this 
positions in the gel (Fig. 2) no significant h i t s  w e r e  f o u n d .  L i k e wise for bands at other 
positions usually no significant hit was found. In contrast, Lcc9 was found in the stronger 
band 5 of strain AT8 (lane C in Fig. 2) and Lcc2 in band 6 of strain 306 (lane B in Fig. 2), respectively. Bands 6 and 7 of st rain 306 (lane B) had a high intensity and overlapped each 
other (Fig. 2). Therefore, we cut out the piece of the gel in between band 6 and 7 named the fragment 6/7, in which Lcc9 and Lcc10 were found. In the stronger band 7 of strain 306 (lane B in Fig. 2) as well as in band 7 of strain 218 and strain AT8 (lanes A and C in Fig. 2), Lcc10 could be determined only for band 7 in strain 306 (lane B in Fig. 2) and strain AT8 (lane C in Fig. 2). Lcc1 was present in all analys ed samples of band 8. Band 9 only present in 
strain AT8 (lane C in Fig. 2) and strain PG78 (lan e G in Fig. 2), gave a hit for Lcc1 in strain 
A T 8 ,  b u t  n o  i d e n t i f i c a t i o n  f o r  s t r a i n  P G 7 8 .  T h e  r e a s o n  f o r  a  p o s i t i v e  d e t e c t i o n  o f  L c c 1  i n  strain AT8 (lane C in Fig. 2) might be the strong Lcc1 band just above band 9. Lcc5 was detected in all strains of band 10, except for strain H5 (lane E in Fig. 2) where no significant 
hit for Lcc5 was obtained. However, in band 10 of strain H5 in addition to Lcc5 Lcc1 was detected.

E. Discussion 
In this study, I have shown that laccase secretion in monokaryotic C. cinerea  strains depends 
on the cultivation medium and the cultivation temperature. Different isoenzymes were 
secreted by the monokaryotic strains which were identified to be Lcc1, Lcc2, Lcc5, Lcc9 and Lcc10, occurring in different amounts and varying compositions at 25 °C in the glucose-based modified Kjalke medium.  
1. Temperature and medium effect 
At standard cultivation temperature of 37 °C in YMG/T medium, only in the monokaryotic 
strain 306 a reasonable activity of 0.53 U/ml occurred, whereas for the other strains no or 
only very low activity of 0.1 to 0.3 U/ml was found. When decreasing the temperature to 25 °C, only in strains 218 and PG78 an increa se in enzymatic activity was observed. For Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 183modified Kjalke, where 4 of the tested strains produced at 37 °C enzymatic amounts above 
0.1 U/ml, a decrease of the cultivation temperature to 25 °C lead to a tremendous increase in laccase activity for most of the strains. Th e results suggest that both, medium composition 
and temperature play a role in laccase producti on in the tested strains. A combination of 
temperature and media effect was previously observed by Tong et al. (2007) for laccase 
production by 
Trametes  sp. cultivated in shaken cultures using copper and ο-toluidine as 
inducer. With the lower temperature at 28 °C highest laccase activity was yielded in a glucose medium, while cultivation at the higher  temperature of 37 °C in cellobiose medium 
shielded in highest laccase activities. For 
Trametes modesta  and Cyathus bulleri  the optimal temperature for laccase production is 
described to be 30 °C (Nyanhongo et  al. 2002, Vasdev et al. 2005). For P. ostreatus  and 
T. versicolor  the highest laccase activity was recorded by Snajdr and Baldrian (2007) to be 
30 °C and 35 °C, respectively, although there are studies indicating that the optimal growth temperature for 
T. versicolor  might be lower (Xavier et al. 2007).  
In comparison to these observations, C. cinerea  showed higher activities in modified Kjalke 
medium at the low temperature of 25 °C with an increase in the laccase activity of over 100fold as compared to 37 °C; although the fungal growth for 
C. cinerea  i s  f o u n d  t o  b e  
optimal at 37 °C (Kües 2000). This leads to the conclusion that there could be an inducing 
effect of temperature on the production of laccase in C. cinerea .  
 
2. Isoenzyme 
Fungi secrete laccase isoenzymes under differen t nutritious and inductive conditions (Munoz 
et al. 1997, Téllez-Téllez et al. 2005). For the native production of laccases in basidiomycete fungi, the nutrient composition of the growth me dium is very important, as this might have 
an impact on the secretion pattern of active enzymes (Pointing et al. 2000, Teerapatsakul et al. 2007). Dong et al. ( 2005), for example incubated 
Trametes gallica  in different media 
under shaken and static conditions. This show ed that the maximal activity and isoenzyme 
patterns of the supernatant depend on the used  media as well as on the incubation condition 
(shaken or static). Alltogether, (Dong et al. 2005) found 20 different laccase bands with three bands occurring in all types of cultures. Whether the different laccase bands depend on different genes (isoenzymes)  or exist due to different post-translational modifications 
(isoforms) was not investigated  (Dong et al. 2005). Another 
Trametes fungus , T. versicolor  
grown in liquid culture showed different isoenzyme patterns of the secreted laccases LacI and LacII depending on the lignocellulosic wast es used for the cultivation (Moldes et al. 
2004). Also two different isoenzymes are present in the strain 
Trametes  sp. AH28-2, which Chapter 4 
 184 were differently induced by aromatic inducers  (Xiao et al. 2004). In the white-rot fungus 
P. ostreatus  three isoenzymes were found in the su pernatant, as well as the corresponding 
gene transcripts ( pox1, poxa1b , poxc) expressed within the cells (P almieri et al. 2000). All in 
all, five laccase isoenzymes were found by Palmieri et al. (1997) in P. ostreatus  and up to 
five laccase isoforms in P. sajor-caju  (Lo et al. 2001). For P. pulmonarius  three different 
laccase isoforms were de tected, of which two were either present in induced or non-induced 
cultures and only one present in both types of cultures (De Souza et al. 2004). Moreover 
intracellular activity was found in P. ostreatus  strains, where at least two isoforms are 
present (Téllez-Téllez et al. 2005).   
Bollag and Leonowicz (1984) tested several ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and 
deuteromycetes for their abilit y to produce laccase in liquid medium with and without 
induction by 2,5-xylidine. New isoforms were found in basidiomycete cultures when induced 
with 2,5-xylidine, whereas for Botrytis cinerea , Rhizoctonia praticola and Podospora anserina 
the same isoenzyme bands as in the non-indu ced cultures were found. This is at least 
partially due to the lower number of laccase genes generally  present in ascomycetes as 
compared to basidiomycetes (Hoegger et al. 2006). For cultures of the basidioymcete 
P. cinnabarinus  no effect in isoenzyme pattern of 2, 5-xylidine induced cult ures was observed 
(Eggert et al. 1996). 
 
Previously, expression of different laccases in C. cinerea  was only determined through 
detection of mRNA transcripts in mycelia l samples (Navarro-González 2008) and cDNA 
isolation of vegetative mycelium (Yaver et al. 1999). Navarro-Gonzáles (2008) found in the 
mycelium of the strains PUK22, OU3-1 and PS00 2-1 transcripts for the eight different genes 
lcc2, lcc3, lcc4, lcc5, lcc9, lcc11, lcc12 and lcc17 respectively, of which only lcc2, lcc3, lcc4, 
lcc11 and lcc17 were found expressed in all three stra ins. Further investigations on mRNA 
production in fruiting with the self-compatible strain AmutBmut revealed six further laccase genes (
lcc1, lcc7, lcc10, lcc13, lcc14 and lcc16) transcribed in cap and stipe tissue. 
AmutBmut was also cultivated in liquid YMG/T medium at 28 °C and 37 °C to test laccase production in liquid cultures, but no laccase activities were detected with simple YMG/T 
medium and only up to 0.1 U/ml upon addition of 0.2 mM CuSO
4 (Navarro-González 2008). 
This contributes to our finding where almost all C. cinerea  strains grown at 37 °C gave no or 
very low laccase activities in YMG/T medium supplemented with 0.1 mM CuSO 4.  
Interestingly, the two main laccases (Lcc1 and Lcc5) secreted by the monokaryotic strains in 
liquid cultures with modified Kjalke medium in this work are only marginally expressed in the mycelium of the 
C. cinerea  strains grown on solid YMG/T medium tested in the work of 
Navarro-González (2008). Nevertheless, for a better comparison between isoenzyme pattern Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 185in liquid cultures and transcripts of laccas e genes in mycelium and fruiting bodies of 
C. cinerea , either the same medium or the same strain should be used. 
   
Overall from the presented secretion data, it seems as Lcc1 and Lcc5 are universal laccases 
in C. cinerea , while other secreted laccases (Lcc2, Lc c9 and Lcc10) might be rather strain-
specific. According to the amino acid sequence, laccase Lcc1 is  mostly related to laccases 
Lcc6, Lcc7 and Lcc11, and Lcc5 to Lcc9, Lcc10 and Lcc15, whereas Lcc2 cluster separately with Lcc3, Lcc12, Lcc13 and Lcc4 (Kilaru et al. 2006a). Currently it is  not known, how much 
the physiological relatedness reflects similarities in enzymatic properties and specific biological functions. However, biochemical data of Lcc1 from Kilaru (2006) and data on Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7 shown in chapter 5 suggest that  the enzymes are not absolutely replaceable 
with each other. Lcc1 is more effective than the other characterised 
C. cinerea  laccases and 
more stable than Lcc6 and Lcc7. Thus, Lcc1 is possibly evolutionary favoured over Lcc6, Lcc7 
and Lcc11 or Lcc1 is more adapted in expression to the environmental cultivation conditions applied. In contrast, Lcc5 being inferior to Lcc1 in enzymatic kinetics for various substrates, but is much better in stability towards organi c solvents indicating that enzymes can be 
differentially adapted to different environmen tal situation with the possible effect of an 
better or broader adaptation to different substrates. Anyhow, the actual biological functions 
remains to be el ucidated for all 
C. cinerea  laccases. 
 
Since we performed an isoenzmye analysis at a specific point of cultivation, namely at the 
day of highest enzymatic activities, we do not know whether the isoenzyme pattern might change over the time. In a preliminary study, we observed differences over the time in the band pattern in laccase zymograms of supernatants of the 
C. cinerea  strains AT8 and 
AmutBmut (data not shown). Further work rega rding time dependences of laccase secretion 
may give a better idea about the expression of different enzymes during the fungal culture. A study on the effect of different phenolic inducers on secretion pattern might show the need for production of different isoenzymes by the fungus to attack the specific phenolic compound. Chapter 4 
 
 186 II. Optimisation of recombinant laccase production in 
Coprinopsis cinerea 
A. Abstract 
Laccases from basidiomycetes have various industrial applications, e.g. in the paper and pulp 
and in the wood industries. Overexpression of these enzymes in ascomycetes does not give satisfactory yields and, often, the enzyme show altered properties. Therefore, we use the basidiomycete 
Coprinopsis cinerea  as a potential host for high level production of laccase 
from efficient promoter gene co nstructs in liquid cultures. The gpdII  promoter of Agaricus 
bisporus  was found most efficient in driv ing laccase production from cloned  C. cinerea  
laccase genes. Various laccase gene s have by now been expressed in C. cinerea  (strain 
FA2222) under the control of the gpdII  promoter. However, yields of enzymatic activities 
differed between the genes. Alteration of growth conditions (media, temperature, host strain) increased laccase yields in submerged cultures. By media screening we could double 
the laccase yields and this was further enhanced by factors of more than 30% though studying effects of different glucose concentrations. Cultivation at different temperatures showed for transformants of three different laccase genes that higher laccase yields could be 
obtained at 25 °C compared to the standard cultivation temperature of 
C. cinerea  at 37 °C. 
Increase in laccase activity at 25 °C was partially due to a background activity since we 
observed some laccase activity also in cultures  of the control transformant without an extra 
laccase gene at 25 °C, alth ough not at 37 °C. Another C. cinerea  strain (LN118) that had no 
natural laccase activity at 25 °C transformed with the laccase gene lcc1 gave lower laccase 
yields at 25 °C than the FA2222 lcc1 transformant, but had a 3 fold increase in laccase 
activity at 37 °C compared to the best production conditions defined for the recombinant 
C. cinerea  strain FA2222. Highest activities of more than 10 U/ml were achieved with 
recombinant production of lcc1 with the strain LN118 at 37 °C in a glucose-based production 
medium.  Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 187B. Introduction 
The secretion of laccases, comp ared to other ligninolytic enzymes [manganese peroxidases 
(MnP) and lignin peroxidases (LiP)], has been  considered to be constitutively in 
basidiomycete fungi (Aro et al. 2005). However, laccase secretion can be enhanced by 
several phenolic (ferulic acid, vanillin), aromat ic (2,5-xylidine, ferulic acid) and alcoholic 
(methanol, ethanol) compounds acting as indu cers (Leonowicz et al. 2001, De Souza et al. 
2004, Meza et al. 2007). High yields of native laccase can be produced by basidiomycete 
systems. Culture supernatants with laccase activities comprise mostly of more than one 
laccase isoenzyme since basidiomycetes are a group of higher fungi which often possess 
large laccase gene families, so for example Coprinopsis cinerea  that has 17 different laccase 
genes (Kilaru et al. 2006a). Although, laccases of basidiomycetes are the most studied ones, only a few paper deal with recombinant expression  of laccase genes in basidiomycetes (Alves 
et al. 2004, Kajita et al. 2004, Kilaru et al. 2006b). Overexpression of laccases is normaly 
attempted in heterologous as comycetous hosts, such as 
Aspergillus  species and yeasts 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Pichia pastoris ). Whereas yields of homologous expressed 
proteins in these ascomycetous fungi are of ten high, amounts of expressed heterologous 
proteins can be quite small (Gouka et al. 1997, Radzio and Kück 1997, Conesa et al. 2001). In general, protein yields can be obtained in filamentous ascomycetes of up to 1-2 g/l from 
heterologously expressed (Maras et al. 1999) and around 30-40 g/l of  homologous expressed 
genes (Schmidt 2005).  For the recombinant expression of basidiomycete laccases, usually heterologous ascomycetous hosts are used (Hong et al. 2002 , Larrondo et al. 2003, Kiiskinen et al. 2004, 
Hong et al. 2007). However, to our best kn owledge highest yields in any recombinant 
laccase production was achieved with the homologous expression of the 
lac1 gene from the 
basidiomycete Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  (Alves et al. 2004). Yields of recombinant laccase 
expression in heterologous systems are in the mg/l range with 5 mg/l for transformants of 
Ceriporiopsis subvermispora  laccase gene lcs in A. niger  (Larrondo et al. 2003) to 135 mg/l 
for T. versicolor  lcc1 or C. cinerea  lcc1 in A. oryzae  (Yaver et al. 1999, Guo et al. 2006). In 
contrast, highest yields of up to 1.2 g/l were  achieved in homologo us over-expression of 
Pycnoporrus cinnabarinus  laccase lac1 (Alves et al. 2004). In standard cultivation conditions 
in yeast extract-malt extract-glucose (YMG) medium, Kilaru ( 2006) achieved protein amounts 
of around 25 mg/l for C. cinerea  Lcc1 (which corresponds to 1.6 U/ml) when recombinantly 
expressing the gene  lcc1 in C. cinerea  under control of the Agaricus bisporus gpdII promoter 
(Kilaru et al. 2006b). Chapter 4 
 
 188 The aim of this study was to increase the yield of the homologous expressed lcc1 gene in C. 
cinerea  strain FA2222 (Kilaru et al. 2006b) by optimisation of the cultivation medium and 
temperature. As extracellular protein degrad ation is a common problem in heterologous 
production (Maras et al. 1999) and might be also a problem in homologous expression, a  
C. cinerea  strain with low proteolytic activity (P . Rittershaus, personal communication) was 
used as a host for recombinant expression of the lcc1 gene.   
 
C. Material and Methods 
1. DNA transformation and C. cinerea  strains used 
Different laccase overexpressing transformants of C. cinerea  strain FA2222 were obtained 
from Kilaru et al. (2006b) and used in  this study for control puropses: the lcc1- (pYSK7, 
clone 26), lcc5- (pYSK20, clone 11) and lcc7-transformant (pYSK28, clone 38) as well as the 
corresponding control (pCc1001, clone 1). 
DNA transformation was performed with the C. cinerea  strain LN118 ( A42 B42 , ade-2 , 
trp-1.1,1.6 ) after the protocol of (Granado et al. 1997) with 1 µg of the plasmid pCc1001 
(trp+, Binninger et al. 1987) and the plasmid pYSK7 (Kilaru et al. 2006b) containing the lcc1 
gene and the constitutive gpdII  promoter of Agaricus bisporus . The transformed protoplasts 
were plated onto regeneration agar plates supplemented with 0.5 mM ABTS (2,2‘-azino-bis [3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate], AppliChe m GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and clones 
were picked for further growth on minimal medium (Granado et al. 1997). Positive 
lcc1-
transformants were tested in liquid YMG cultur es for their ability to produce laccase and the 
best clone (LN7-2) was used with a control tran sformant (pCc1001 in LN118) in this work for 
optimisation of media conditions.  
2. Fungal cultures with spore inoculum 
The fungi were grown on YMG-agar (per litre: 4 g yeast, 10 g malt extract, 10 g glucose, 10 g agar) plates at 37 °C until the mycelium reached the border of the Petri dishes. Sterile ddH
2O was poured onto the plate and the mycelium containing the asexual spores was 
scraped with a spatula from the agar. The solution was filtered over a sterile funnel filled with glass wool, which keeps back the fungal  hyphae. A Thoma counting chamber was used 
to determine the spore concentration in the eluate. Pre-cultures inoculated with spore 
suspensions were done in 500 ml flasks, filled with 50 ml of modified Kjalke or YMG medium 
and the spore concentration was set to a final concentration of 10
6 spores/ml. The flasks Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 189were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C as standing cultures. Pre-cultures were homogenised by 
an Ultra-Turrax® for around 30 sec at 8000 rpm (rotations per minute) and 30 sec at 9500 
rpm. For the main-cultures, 500 ml flasks were  filled with 100 ml of either BSM (per litre 
(Braun-Lüllemann et al. 1997): 5 g glucose, 0.5 g yeast extract, 1 g KH 2PO4, 0.5 g KCl, 0.65 
g L-asparagine, 10 mg FeSO 4 x 7H 2O, 8 mg Mn(CHCOO) 2 x 4H 2O, 2 mg ZnNO 3 x 4H 2O, 50 mg 
Ca(NO 3)2 x 4H 2O, 3 mg CuSO 4 x 5H 2O), MM (per litre: 10 g glucose, 2 g L-asparagine, 1 g 
KH2PO4, 2.25 g Na 2HPO 4, 0.29 g Na 2SO4, 0.5 g (NH 4)2C4H4O6, 0.25 g MgSO 4x7H 2O, 40 µg 
thiamine), Moore (per litre (Moore 1969): 10 g glucose, 1.35 g KH 2PO4, 0.12 g MgSO 4 x 
7H2O, 1.5 g NH 4Cl, 1.45 g Na 2HPO 4, 0.29 g Na 2SO4, 2 g L-asparagine, 0.4 mg thiamine), 
modified Kjalke (per litre (Kjalke et al. 1992): 10 g yeast extract, 20 g glucose, 0.5 g CaCl 2 x 
2H2O, 2 g KH 2PO4, 50 mg MgSO 4 x 7H 2O), Raulin (per litre: 33.4 g glucose, 45 mg FeSO 4 x 
7H2O, 2.65 g NH 4NO3, 0.4 g (NH 4)3PO4, 0.16 g (NH 4)2SO4, 45 mg ZnSO 4 x 7H 2O, 0.4 g KCO 3, 
2.65 g tartaric acid (C 4H6O6), 0.26 g MgCl 2), YMG (per litre: 4 g yeast extract, 10 g malt 
extract, 10 g glucose) medium. All media used for the main-culture were supplemented with 0.1 mM CuSO
4 and inoculated with 5 ml of the homo genised pre-culture. Cultivation took 
place at 25 °C or 37 °C on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm.  
3. Glucose determination 
The glucose concentration was determined indirectly with the Glucose (HK) Assay Kit from 
Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Muni ch, Germany). Glucose was enzymatically 
phosphorylated and afterwards oxidised with NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) to 
6-phosphogluconate. During the oxidation, NAD is reduced to NADH, which correlates 
directly with the glucose concentration and which was measured at 340 nm with a 
spectrophotometer. Glucose st andards (Sigma, G 3285) were measured with the same 
method in concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, 0. 25, 0.125 and 0.0625 g/l, respectively. The 
supernatant samples of the fungal cultures were diluted to fit in the NADH absorption curve for the glucose standards.  
4. Ergosterol measurement 
For determination of the biomass dry weight from the same flask, the culture was homogenised by an Ultra-Turrax as described above. 15 ml were transferred into a 50 ml Falcon tube, centrifuged at 4000 rpm (1735 g) for 10 min (centrifuge 5810R, Eppendorf, 
Hamburg, Germany). The supernatant was discarded and the tubes were stored at -20 °C Chapter 4 
 
 190 until further use. The remaining homogenised culture was used for calculation of the 
biomass dry weight (see Determinatio n of the mycelial dry weight).  
The frozen biomass was lyophilised and ergosterol determin ation was performed according 
to Nielsen and Madsen (2000). The dry sample s were mixed with 10% KOH in methanol with 
200 ppm BHT (2,6-di- tetra-butyl-4-methyl-phenol) and 5 µg/ml cholesterol as an internal 
standard. The samples were mixed with glass beads to fragment the lyophilised mycelium. 
When the biomass was uniformly suspended, th e samples were incubated at 60 °C for 3 h 
and after cooling to room temperat ure centrifuged for 15 min at 1735 g and 4 °C. 2 ml of 
the supernatant were transferred into a new tube and 2 ml of hexane was added. The samples were mixed and phase separation was achieved by addition of 4 ml dH
2O. The tubes 
were shaken for at least 30 min, centrifuged at  2000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min and 1 ml of the 
hexane phase was transferred into an e-cup. Th e solution was completely dried in a vacuum 
centrifuge and stored at -20 °C until further use. For derivatisation, the sample s were dissolved in 10 µl pyridine and 50 µl BSTFA [N,O-
bis(trimethylsily)trifluoroacetam ide]. Samples were incubated at RT for 30 min, dried and 
dissolved in 150-300 µl of toluene for subseq uent GC-MS analysis (6890N, Agilent Techn., 
Network GC Systems, Santa Clara CA, USA). 
 
5. Determination of the myce lial d ry weight (DW) 
The volume of the fungal culture was measured and poured into a Büchner filter containing 
a cellulose filter whose dry weight was measured  in advance. The filter together with the wet 
biomass was placed in an oven at 80 °C and the filter was weighed every day until the 
weight was stable. The DW is calc ulated by the fo llowing equation:

Darmstadt, Germany). The conv ersion of ABTS was observed spectroscopically at 420 nm 
(ε = 36000 M –1 cm-1) (Matsumura et al. 1986). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as 
the amount of substrate in µmol transformed per min and the activities are given in U per 
volume. Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 191Proteolytic activity was determined with azocasein as a substrate. Azocasein was dissolved in 
50 mM KH 2PO4 (pH 6.2) to a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v). 100 µl of sample was mixed 
with 500 µl of the azocasein solution and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Not cleaved 
azocasein was precipitated with 400 µl of tric hloracetic acid (20%, TCA) and precipitated 
protein is separated by centrifugation. The absorption of the supernatant was measured in a 
UV/VIS-spectrophotometer (DU 800 V, Beckman Coulter Inc., Krefeld, Germany) at 340 nm. 
One unit is defined as the change of absorption at 340 nm per min and given in U/L.  Chapter 4 
 
 192 D. Results 
1. Media supporting growth for recombinant laccase Lcc1 production 
Different media were tested for their ability to support production of laccase with the  lcc1 
transformant of C. cinerea  FA2222. The pCc1001 transformant of strain FA2222 was used in 
parallel as control. The tested  media were inoculated with a homogenised pre-culture (YMG) 
and incubated for 12 days at 37 °C. Laccase activity was measured every second day and 
the dry weight (DW) was determined after the last day of measurement. Only the complex media YMG and modified Kjalke gave good growth conditions and best biomass production (data not shown) for the 
lcc1 transformant and the control transformant and, therefore, high 
laccase activities in the supernatant (see Fig. 1). The pH of the media with the highest laccase production (modified Kjalke and YMG) sh ifted from initially pH 6.3 to around pH 8.7 
to 9.1 for both the 
lcc1 transformant and the control transformant pCc1001, whereas for all 
other media the pHs remained between pH 4.4 and 7.5 (the pH was measured only at the end of the experiment at day 12 of cultivation; data not shown).

 193To study the effect of the modified Kjalke medium on the lcc1 transformant in more detail, 
different glucose concentrations were tested: 1%, 2%, 3% and 4%. Growth was observed 
by measuring the dry weight (DW) of the myce lial cultures and by meaning its ergosterol 
content. The DW of the cultures increased steadily from day 1 onwards until the maximal DW values of 6.1 g/l at day 4, 10.2 g/l at day 5, 14.2 g/l at day 6 and 16.3 g/l at day 7 were reached for the media supplemented with 1%, 2% , 3% and 4% glucose, respectively. After 
reaching the maximum DW in cultures with 1-3%  glucose, the DW slowly declined, whereas 
the DW in cultures with 4% glucose remained more stable with high DW of 15-16 g/l over 
the time (Fig. 2A).

 194 It is known that filamentous fungi produce po lysaccharides as nutrient storage (Chaumeton 
et al. 1993, Burns et al. 1994) which rest at the outer part of the fungal hyphae and, 
therefore, could account for higher biomass values. To control this, the ergosterol content of 
the fungal cultures was determ ined as part of the cell me mbrane of living fungal cells. 
Irrespectively of the glucose content, the ergosterol content in the cultures was similar until 
day 5. Afterwards, it started to decline at day 6 for cultures with 1% and 2% glucose and on day 7 for cultures with 3% glucose. In co ntrast, for the media supplemented with 4% 
glucose, no decrease in its ergosterol content was observed at later times of cultivation (Fig. 2B). The maximum ergosterol content of the different cultures increased with higher glucose concentration from 136 mg ergosterol per litre to 156, 168 and 200 mg ergosterol/l 
for 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% glucose in the modified Kjalke medium, respectively. However, the relative enhancement between 1% and 4% glucose was lower for the values of the 
ergosterol content (1.5 fold increase) compared to the value of the DW (2.7 fold increase). The calculated correlations between ergosterol and DW with respect to the initial glucose content in the culture medium from 1% to 4% glucose are given in Table 1.   Highest laccase activities of 3.3 U/ml were obtained in modified Kjalke medium with 3% glucose at day 7 of cultivation at 37 °C (Fig. 3A). The maximum laccase activities in cultures 
with other glucose concentrations occurred at da y 5, 6 and 9 with activities of 2.1, 2.5 and 
3.1 U/ml for cultures with 1%, 2% and 4% gluc ose in the medium, respectively (Fig. 3A). 
However, DW-specific laccase activity showed  a different pattern. The highest yield of 
362 U/gdw (gram dry weight) was obtained in modified Kjalke medium with 1% glucose

 196 (Fig. 3B). In media with 2% and 3% glucose, the yield had an average value of 250 U/gdw 
and in media with 4% glucose almost 200 U/gdw. The time points of the peak activities for 
the DW-specific laccase activity were identical with the highest laccase-ergosterol relations, 
except for cultures of modified Kjalke medium with 4% glucose. Ergosterol-specific activities 
in cultures with 1% and 2% glucose with 7.3 U/ mg ergosterol at day 5 of cultivation and 
7.7 U/mg ergosterol at day 6 of cultivation, respectively, were relatively comparable to each other. Likewise, the ergsoterol-specfic activities in cultures with 3% and 4% glucose with 9.8 and 9.2 U/mg ergosterol, respectively, at day 7 of cultivation were rela tively comparable to 
each other (Fig. 3B, C and Table 1).

 197Since glucose as part of the modified Kjalke medium was altered in concentration, the 
glucose content of the supernatant was observed via determination of the glucose in the cultures with different initial glucose concentrations over the whole cultivation periods 
(Fig. 4A).  Glucose depletion in the supernatant occurred on day 4, 5, 7 and 8 for media with 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% glucose, respectively. All cultures showed a similar metabolisation rate 
of the glucose with around 3.7 to 3.9 g of glucose per day of cultivation as calculated from the slope of the regression lines of the actual  glucose concentration over the time (Fig. 4A, 
for the calculated values see Table 2).

In addition to glucose, other C- and N-sources in the supernatant were observed via the general C/N ratio. The C/N ratio of the media started with values of around 7 to 16 for 
cultures with the different glucose concentrations of 1% to 4 % glucose (Fig. 4B). In cultures with an initial content of 1% and 2% glucose, the C/N ratio declined clearly from 
day 1 of cultivation onwards, whereas for cultur es with 3% and 4% initial glucose a delay of 
3 to 4 days in a rapid decrease of the C/N ratio was observed. In cultures with 3% and 4% initial glucose, a rapid decline in the C/N ratios occurred from day 4 to 7 and day 6 to 9, respectively (Fig. 4B). At the end, all cultures  had the same low C/N-ratio of around 4, which 
was reached at days 4, 5, 7 and 9 of cultiv ation for the cultures with 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% 
initial glucose, respectively.   Chapter 4 
 
 198 2. Temperature as an important growth parameter 
To determine the temperature effect on the laccase activity of the  C. cinerea  FA2222 lcc1 
transformant, three different temperatures were tested for cultivation of the strain in YMG 
and in modified Kjalke medium. In YMG only small effects by the temperature on maximum 
yields of laccase activities were seen when cultivating the lcc1 transformant at 25 °C, 30 °C 
and 37 °C. In all cultures, irrespectively of the growth temperature, maximum laccase 
activities in the supernatant were around 1.1 to 1.5 U/ml although the days of maximum laccase activity differed (maximum laccase acti vity at 25 °C of 1.5 U/ml at day 9 of 
cultivation, at 30 °C of 1.1 U/ml at day 5 of cu ltivation and at 37 °C of 1.1 U/ml at day 4 of 
cultivation). In contrast, in modified Kjalke  m e d i u m  a  t r e m e n d o u s  i n c r e a s e  i n  l a c c a s e  
activities was observed at a cultivation temperature of 25 °C compared to the higher temperatures (Fig. 5). At 30 °C and 37 °C, almost the same maximal laccase activity was observed with measured values of 2.2 U/ml and 2.7 U/ml, respectively. At 25 °C, a three fold increase as compared to the higher growth temperatures was noted with a highest measured laccase activity of 7.0 U/ml at day 10 of cultivation.

 199Temperature effects on laccase activities were further studied in modified Kjalke medium 
with 2% glucose with FA2222 transformants Lcc1 , Lcc5 and Lcc7, and, in addition, with a 
FA2222 pCc1001 transformant carrying no extra laccase gene. For all strains, higher 
enzymatic activities were observed at a cultivation temperature of 25 °C as compared to 
37 °C (Fig. 6). In this series of experiment s, transformant Lcc1 produced as maximum 
9.1 U/ml laccase at 25 °C (day 10 of cultivation), transformant Lcc5 produced 31.1 U/ml (day 10 of cultivation), transformant Lcc7 pr oduced 6.8 U/ml (day 8 of cultivation) and 
control transformant pCc1001 produced 3.5 U/ml (day 9 of cultivation). The difference in the 
laccase activity of the 
lcc5 transformant between 25 °C and 37 °C was 2.5 U/ml, 
respectively, and thus   comparable in value to the difference of 3.5 U/ml measured between cultures of transformant pCc1001 at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. In cultures of the 
lcc1 
transformant and the  lcc7 transformant a difference in laccase activity between 25 °C and 
37 °C of 6.3 and 6.7 U/ml was observed, respecti vely, and thus almost twice as high as for 
the control transformant pCc1001. It is thus very likely that transformants Lcc1 and Lcc7 
produced at 25 °C about 5 U/ml and 3 U/ml of recombinant laccase, respectively, in addition of about 3.5 U/ml of background activity from native production. In case of transformant Lcc5, about 90% of the obtained laccase yields at  25 °C is expected to be from recombinant 
production.

 200 C. cinerea  strain FA2222 was so far used for recomb inant production by its failure to secrete 
laccase into a culture medium when grown at 37 °C (Kilaru et al. 2006 and Table 2 in section 
4.I of this study). The above results indicate that recombinant enzyme production is better at 
25 °C. However, at 25 °C not all of the laccase activity found in the culture supernatants 
might be due to the enzyme coming from recombinant production. Although the impurities m i g h t  b e  l o w ,  f o r  p u r i f i c a t i o n  o f  a n  e n z y m e  from a culture supernatant for example, a 
situation of high enzyme production with no  impurities of related other enzymes, is 
preferable. Therefore, another strain than FA2222 producing no natural laccase activity at a culture temperature of 25 °C would be required. Comparison of different 
C. cinerea  strains at 
different culture temperatures for laccase production suggested that the monokaryon LN118 could be such ideal strain for recombinant laccase production (see section 4.I). LN118 showed negligible laccase activities (0.00-0.11 U/ml) in YMG and modified Kjalke medium at 25 °C and 37 °C (see section 4.I) and, thus, was transformed with the 
lcc1 containing 
plasmid pYSK7 (Kilaru 2006) in co-transformation with the trp1+ plasmid pCc1001. Positive 
clones were obtained after complementation of the trp1 tryptophan auxotrophy of 
monokaryon LN118 and selection of trp1+ transformants on regeneration medium (Fig. 7). 
Three clones were tested for best laccase production in YMG medium at 37 °C. The range of maximum laccase production was between 0.7 and 1.5 U/ml. The LN118 clone LN7-2 
(named after LN118, pYSK7, clone 2) was found to be the best laccase producer in liquid 
culture and, therefore, the clone was used for further experiments.

LN7-2 and a corresponding control transformant  (pCc1001 in LN118 without further laccase 
gene) were cultivated in modified Kjalke medium at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively. The 
laccase activities in the cultures were measur ed every day from day 2 of cultivation onwards 
over a period of 10 days (Fig. 8A); only for LN7-2 at 25 °C cultivation and measurements were prolonged for 4 further days, because maximum activity of laccase was not reached before or at day 10 (data not shown in Fig. 8). The maximum laccase activity of LN7-2 of 8.0 U/ml was reached at day 11 of cultivation at 25 °C and, afterwards, the laccase activity decreased to 2.3 U/ml at day 14 of cultivation. Maximum laccase activity of LN7-2 at 37 °C was reached with 10.8 U/ml at day 5 of cultivat ion. For comparison, the control transformant 
(pCc1001) showed minor activities at both test ed temperatures of up to maximum 0.1 U/ml 
during the whole cultivation period of 10 days (Fig . 8A).  It is interesting to note that, unlike 024681012

 202 for the FA2222 lcc1 transformant (Fig. 5), for the LN118 lcc1 transformant the total laccase 
yields were better at 37 °C than at 25 °C. 
 
In the series of temperature experiments with the LN118 transformants, next to the laccase 
activities in the culture supernatant also proteolytic activities were measured (Fig. 8). The protease activity for LN7-2 and the control transformant showed a similar pattern to each other for the two temperatures. At 37 °C, highest activity occurred at day 7 of cultivation two days after the peak of the laccase activi ties were obtained with protease values of 
296 mU/ml for the 
lcc1 transformant and 254 mU/ml for the control transformant. At 25 °C, 
protease activities in the culture supernatants of both transformants we re steadily increasing 
within the 10 days of parallel cultivations to levels of 162 mU/ml for the control transformant and the levels of 106 mU/ml for LN7-2 at day 10 of cultivation. Upon prolonged cultivation of 
LN7-2 at 25 °C, the 
lcc1 transformant showed the highest proteolytic activity of 240 mU/ml 
at day 14 of cultivation three days after the la ccase activity peak. Accordingly, the maximum 
protease activity to be obtained at 25 °C seems to be in the same range as the maximum 
activities obtained at 37 °C - 254 mU/ml and 296 mU/ml for the control transformant and LN7-2, respectively, at day 7 of cultivation (Fig. 8B).  
 
Proteolytic activities in the supernatants might negatively influence the amount of laccase 
activities by degradation of parts of secreted enzymes. To test whether the proteolytic activity possibly had an impact on the degrad ation of the laccase in the culture broth, the 
supernatants of the 
lcc1 transformant with the highest proteolytic activity (from day 7 of 
cultivation for 37 °C cultures and from day 14 of cultivation for 25 °C cultures) were used. 
One part of the supernatant (1 ml in total) was boiled for 15 min to deactivate any protease activity, supplemented with purified Lcc1 (see chapter 5) to a final amount of 2 U/ml and incubated at 25 °C. The other part of the supernatant, with a natural laccase activity of around 6.8 U/ml and 1.2 U/ml for the 25 °C and 37 °C culture supernatants, respectively, was directly incubated at 25 °C. The laccase activities in the sample were measured at different times of incubation (Fig. 9). Overall, the decrease in lacacse activity within the samples over the time followed the same patter n, regardless of whether a supernatant was 
obtained from a culture grown at 25 °C or a culture grown at 37 °C and regardless of whether a supernatant was fresh or heat-inactivated with subsequent addition of external laccase (Fig. 9). Within the first 6 h of incuba tion, the activity loss in all samples was little 
with about 11 to 20%. After 24 h, the laccase acti vity of the fresh supernatants from 37 °C 
and 25 °C cultures retained 41% and 47% of the laccase original ac tivity, respectively 
(Fig. 9). The heat-inactivated supernatant from cultivations at 25 °C and 37 °C with added Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 203laccase Lcc1 after 24 h of incubation sh owed remaining activities of 61% and 79%, 
respectively. After further incubation up to in total 48 h, lacca se activities were still present 
in all samples with 16 and 18% of activity in the native supernatants and denaturised 
supernatant with added Lcc1 from 37 °C cult ivation of clone LN7-2 and with 32 and 35% of 
activity in the native supernatant and the denaturised supernatant with added Lcc1 from 
25 °C cultivation of clone LN7-2.

residual laccase activties were determined in percentage of the original activity. Note that the values were 
calculated from each a single sample. 
 
 
E. Discussion   
Defining optimal culture conditions for the native, but also recombinant production of 
enzymes is important to increase the yield of the production of interest and to understand the requirements of the organism for such production. In this study, the recombinant production of the laccase Lcc1 from the basidiomycete 
C. cinerea  was studied in 
transformants of these species under different culture conditions (media and temperature) in shake flask cultures.  Day of cultivationRemaining laccase activity [%] 020406080100120

 204 1. Media effects on laccase production 
When different C. cinerea  media described in the literature were tested for growth and 
enzyme production in liquid cultures, it wa s observed that this dung-inhabiting fungus 
prefers complex media, such as the rich co mplex YMG and modified Kjalke media, as 
compared to the semi-complex (BSM) and synthetic (MM, Moore and Raulin) media (Fig. 1). 
As earlier described in section 4.I, the medi a might have a tremendous effect on native 
production of laccase in C. cinerea  strains. This effect can also be seen in Fig. 1, where the 
control pCc1001 transformant without an extra laccase gene showed no activity in YMG and low activity in BSM and modified Kjalke medium. In comparison, the laccase transformant Lcc1 yielded high enzymatic yields in the YMG and even higher yields in modified Kjalke 
medium and also some activity in BSM. In contrast, in Raulin, MM and Moore medium, laccase activities of the control were as high or higher as for the 
lcc1 transformant. Growth 
of the fungal strains was generally better in  modified Kjalke medium than in the YMG 
medium and this probably bases on the higher amounts of glucose and yeast extract in the modified Kjalke medium.   From reports in the literature, the monosaccha ride glucose seems to be the best carbon 
source for 
C. cinerea , besides the disaccharides maltose, lactose and fructose (Madelin 1956, 
Moore 1969), showing that hexose-based sugars are preferred by the fungus. In other 
basidiomycete fungi, it was already shown that glucose might have an impact on laccase 
secretion. In Trametes pubescence  an increase in the glucose concentration from 1% to 4% 
increased the laccase activity 5 times, whereas a further augmentation in glucose concentration lowered the final laccase activity (Galhaup et al. 2002). This repression of 
laccase commonly secretion by high glucose concentration may be due to an energy saving effect, which occurs in fungi (Ronne 1995). Tavares et al. (2005) observed that a glucose decrease of <0.8% increased laccase activity in 2,5-xylidine and copper induced 
Trametes 
versicolor  cultures of more than 3-fold. 
 In this study with 
C. cinerea  transformants, modified Kjalke medium was found best for 
recombinant laccase production, and YMG medium second best (Fig. 1). Although we used a 
lcc1 transformant with a constitutive promoter for the overexpression of the laccase Lcc1, an 
effect of medium concerning the yield of lacc ase activity was already previously observed. 
Kilaru et al. (2006b) found that the medium YMG gave much better laccase yields than minimal medium.  Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 205Both the YMG and the modified Kjalke media contain relatively high amounts of glucose 
together with nitrogen supplied from yeast-extract. In order to study the effect of the relative concentration on growth and laccase production of the FA2222 
lcc1 transformant, 
modified Kjalke medium was prepared with different glucose amounts (1%, 2%, 3% and 4%). The peak of the DW was reached for all tested glucose concentrations one day before the highest laccase activity was achieved. In contrast, the peak of the ergosterol content appeared at around the same time with the highest laccase yields. When comparing the 
peaks of the DW and ergosterol values (Fig. 2A and B) the trend of increase and subsequent decrease in DW and ergosterol per l of culture seems to be similar. However, the ratios of ergosterol and DW [mg ergosterol/g DW] for the used media are different and clearly depend on the glucose amount added to the culture medium. The ratio ergosterol to DW slightly increased over the time with highest ratios of 55, 45, 32 and 27 mg ergosterol/g DW at the end of the cultivation in modified Ka jlke medium with 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% glucose, 
respectively (Fig. 10). Assuming that the ergosterol content and/or the DW specify the growth of the fungus, their ratio should be more or less stable over the whole culture. In the literature, the ergosterol to DW ratio of basidiomycetes are given for agar plate cultures, mushrooms and solid state fermentation (SSF) on wood or other materials, but for liquid cultures only few studies are available (Barajas-Aceves et al. 2002, Silva et al. 2005, 
Niemenmaa et al. 2008). Barajas-Aceves et al . (2002) for example cultivated twenty white-
rot strains in liquid culture and obtained values  of around 2.38 to 13.06 mg ergosterol/g DW 
after 7 days of incubation. When studying three species in more detail over a growth period 
of 14 days, the ergosterol to DW values increased for all cultures during the incubation r e a c h i n g  s t a t i o n a r y  v a l u e s  o f  a r o u n d  5 ,  1 3  t o  2 0  m g  e r g o s t e r o l / g  D W  a t  t h e  e n d  o f  t h e  cultivation for the tested strains of 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium , Coriolopsis gallica  and 
Bjerkandera adusta , respectively. In this study, the lcc1 transformant of C. cinerea  strain 
FA2222 showed also in all cultures a steady increase in the ergosterol to DW ratio (Fig. 10). Chapter 4

modified Kjalke medium at 37 °C with different glucose concentrations [1% (diamonds), 2% (squares), 3% 
(rectangles) and 4% (circles)]. Bars above or below the lines indicate the standard deviation. Mean values were 
calculated from at least 3 parallel cultures.  
 
To better understand the relationship between the ergosterol content and the DW in the different cultures, a regression for the values obtained over the whole cultivation time might be useful to compare both types of values. This was done previously for nine 
Lentinula edodes  strains in a combined analysis of the values for all strains leading to a slope 
of 4.1 mg ergosterol/g DW for the calculated  linear regression line with a relatively good 
regression coefficient of 0.87 (n>40; n= numbe r of single values analysed) (Silva et al. 
2005). In another study with several white and brown rot fungi, values of 0.6 to 3.9 mg 
ergosterol/g DW and regression coefficients of  0.235 to 0.969 (for each fungus: n=5) were 
obtained (Niemenmaa et al. 2008), but the very low number of analysed samples per fungus 
makes even the ratios for ergosterol/DW with highest regression coefficients insecure in 
reliability. In this study with n=30-40 per cult ivation condition, linea r regressions of the 
values over the whole culturing periods of the lcc1 transformant lead to correlation values of 
19.7, 16.0, 12.0 and 10.9 mg ergosterol/g DW wit h regression coeffiecients of 0.717, 0.832, 
0.863 and 0.939 for the cultures with 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% glucose, respectively (Fig. 11). 
The results here in this study therefore showed a good reliable correlation for ergosterol to DW ratios for cultures with 2%, 3% and 4% glucose, whereas the regression coefficient for 1% was comparatively low and the calculated ergosterol to DW ratio is less reliable. 
Comparing the data for the different glucose co ncentrations strongly supports an effect of 
the sugar concentration in the medium on the ergosterol/DW ratios. With increasing sugar 010203040506070

Day of cultivationNative and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 207concentrations, the ergosterol to DW ratios decrease. The reason for the lower 
ergosterol/DW ratios at higher glucose concentration is probably due to the higher amount of polysaccharides in cultures with high gluc ose concentrations. Secret ion of polysaccharides 
out of the cells and deposition of the material on the hyphal surface would cause a higher absolute dry weight per cellular unit than without such depositions. In contrast, ergosterol 
being present in the cellular membranes of fungi (Niemenmaa et al. 2008), has only a limited space per cellular unit to distribute.   In any case, the growth curves deriving from either the ergosterol content or the DW show similar overall patterns (see Fig. 2) and, therefore, are both adequate to describe the growth of the 
lcc1-transformant. Accordingly, one might either correlate laccase activities in the 
culture supernatant as an indication of the specific laccase production with the ergosterol content in the cultures and/or with the DW values of the cultures.

Laccase activities in the modified Kjalke me dium with the different glucose concentrations

cultures with 1% glucose, at day 6 of cultivat ion for cultures with 2% glucose, at day 7 of

 208 glucose. Also, the biomass specific activities [U/mg ergosterol and U/g DW] increase for the 
different cultures with increasing glucose co ncentration in the media (Fig. 3). In the 
experimental phase, due to the usage of the constitutive A. bisporus  gpdII  promoter 
(Harmsen et al. 1992, Kilaru and Kü es 2005) for the overexpression of lcc1, a correlation 
between active biomass and laccase should be present. In Fig. 3B and C, one can observe 
that the calculated DW-specific laccase activity varies much more than the calculated ergosterol-specific laccase activity, although the standard deviations for some of the ergosterol-based values are quite high. As shown in Table 1, the calculated ergosterol-based maximum laccase activities are comparable to the volumetric ones. Both types of values define the same order of glucose concentration in the medium (3%>4%>2%>1%, see Table 1) for the highest laccase production. A ccordingly from this observation, one might 
conclude that the biomass-specific laccase activity as determined for the ergosterol content is the more reliable estimation of culture parameter than the DW-based specific lacacse activity. From the order of best laccase produc tion in the medium, one would for future work 
suggest to use 3% glucose in the modified Kjalke medium for batch cultures.  Interesting is the decline of the laccase activity curves at later stages of cultivation (Fig. 3A) 
in cultures with 1%, 2% and 3% glucose as compared to the more or less stable laccase 
activity curve at the later stages of cultivation in the 4% culture. The peaks of the volumetric 
activities in the culture with 1%, 2% and 3% glucose occur at the same day as highest biomass yields were obtained, namely days 4,  5 and 6, respectively. After this point of 
highest laccase activity, no additional laccas e is possibly produced in the cultures and, 
furthermore, the resident lacc ase will be degraded or inactiva ted slowly over the time. The 
longer residing laccase activity in cultures  with 4% glucose might be due to a stabilising 
effect of components in the supernatant (e.g. polysaccharides) or, although the stationary growth phase will have been reached (Fig. 2), the fungus still produces laccase compensating the concomitant degradation of the enzyme. Therefore, modified Kjalke medium with 4% glucose might be considered to be a better production medium than the media with lower glucose concentrations. Nevertheless, in continuous cultivation, where a 
steady-state-point between growth, substrate and product is seeked, cultures with the highest production rate at a consta nt biomass level should be used.  
 
2. Temperature effect s on laccase secretion 
Heterologous expression of the laccase encoding lcc1 gene of T. versicolor  in Pichia 
methanolica  could be optimised by changing the cultivation temperature from 30 °C to 20 °C Native and recombinant laccase production with Coprinopsis cinerea  
 209with an increase in laccase activity by the factor of 1.7 (Guo et al. 2006). Also Hong et al. 
(2002) were able to increase the laccase yields of a heterologous expression of lcc1 from 
T. versicolor  in P. pastoris  by decreasing the temperature from 30 °C to 20 °C. Heterologous 
expression of lcc2 of T. versicolor  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  gave 16fold higher laccase 
yields at 19 °C as compared to 28 °C in liquid cultivation (Cassland and Jonsson 1999). Also 
In this study, the decrease of the cultivatio n temperature from 37 °C to 25 °C lead to an 
increase in laccase activity of the C. cinerea  FA2222 lcc1 transformant cultivated in modified 
Kjalke medium supplemented with 2% glucose (Fig. 5). However, also the pCc1001 control transformant, as well as the 
lcc5 and lcc7 transformant, showed a higher laccase activity 
when cultivated at 25 °C (Fig. 6). Usage of a lcc1 transformant of monokaryon LN118 as 
another another C. cinerea  strain for laccase production did not lead to a higher laccase 
activity when cultivated at 25 °C, but inst ead when cultivated at 37 °C. The maximum 
activity at 25 °C with 8.0 U/ml was around 3 U/ml lower than the maximum activities of 10.8 U/ml obtained at 37 °C. The result described he re and the results presented earlier in section 
4.I of this thesis indicate that strains of different genetic background (compare Kertesz-
Chaloupková et al. 1998 for strain origins) will behave quite variably in enzyme production. 
In consequence, any new strain of 
C. cinerea  for laccase production will again have to be 
tested for enzyme production at different temperature. 
 
3. Protease production and effect on laccase activties 
In cultures of the LN118 lcc1 transformant, next to laccase activities, proteolytic activties 
were measured (Fig. 8). Most importantly, the proteolytic activities for 25 °C and 37 °C 
cultures increased with decreasing laccase activity (Fig. 8), but the proteases from the 25 °C and 37 °C culture supernatant seem not to degrade the homologously expressed laccase (Fig. 9). As there is no degradation due to proteolytic activity in the supernatant, no protease-deficient strains appear to be needed for the recombinant production of Lcc1 by 
C. cinerea . Since culture supernatants from both cu ltivation temperatures, 25 °C and 37 °C, 
were tested for their effects on proteolytic in activation of Lcc1 and no major differences 
were detected (Fig. 9) , differences in degradation of pr oduced laccase will not account for 
the different amounts of laccase activities dete cted in the cultures grown at the different 
temperature. In the future, more LN118 transf ormants will have to be tested in order to 
determine whether higher laccase production at 37 °C from laccase genes cloned behind the 
A. bisporus gpdII  promoter is common in this strain as it is at 25 °C for all so far tested 
FA2222 transformants.

 Purification and characterisation of three new laccases from the basidiomycete C. cinerea  
219 I. Abstract 
Laccases are oxidoreductases containing 4 copper atoms involved in the transport of 
electrons from a substrate to a oxygen molecule , which is reduced to water. The reaction 
mechanism for laccases is known and also structural features of several representatives of 
this class of enzymes have been elucidated. Laccases are widespread in nature and have distinct biochemical characteristics. In this study, three new laccases (Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7) from 
Coprinopsis cinerea  were recombinantly expressed in the same organism. The 
molecular and biochemical charac teristics of the enzymes were  studied and compared with 
the already characterised C. cinerea  enzyme Lcc1. Inhibition experiments and stability tests 
with different laccase inhibitors and solvents were performed. The molecular weight for all laccases was within the range of 61-63 kDa an d N-glycosylation amount accounts for 2-5% 
of the total weight. Different isoform bands of  the purified laccases were separated by 
isoelectric focusing (IEF). The is oelectric points (pI) of the isof orms were in the range of 3.5 
and 3.7 for Lcc5 and Lcc6, and from 4.1 to 4.2 for Lcc7. The optimal pH for the standard substrate ABTS varied from 3.0 to 5.0 for laccases Lcc7 and Lcc5, respectively, whereas optimal temperature of 50 °C was found to be the same for all tested laccases. Compared to the earlier characterised Lcc1, the laccases test ed in this study showed a lower catalytical 
efficiency for the substrates ABTS, DMP, guai acol but not for syringaldazine (SGZ), which 
was most effectively oxidised by Lcc7. Lcc1 described by Kilaru (2006) in a previous study, was the most stable laccase in contact with di fferent laccase inhibitors compared to Lcc5, 
Lcc6 and Lcc7. Lcc1 remained more than 50% of its activity when incubated with 10 mM 
NaF. Nevertheless, Lcc5 was th e most stable laccase when in cubated in acetonitrile (ACN) 
and ethanol (EtOH), where more than 50% of its initial activity could be detected after incubation of 2 h in 90% ACN and 4 h in 90% EtOH, respectively.  Unlike for enzymes Lcc6 and Lcc7, stable crystals were obtained for Lcc5. The 
crystallographic structure of Lcc5 is presented in this work and the distance of the copper 
atoms towards their amino acid ligands is calculated.

 220 II. Introduction 
Laccases (benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) are blue multi-copper oxidases 
that bind four copper atoms at 3 copper binding sites, whereas the T1 and T2 sites contain one copper atom each and the T3 site two copper atoms (Messerschmidt et al. 1989). The oxidation of substrates, which are mono-, di- and polyphenols as well as aromatic amines 
(Hoegger et al. 2007), is fulfilled by the en zyme via a one electron reduction at the 
mononuclear T1 site. At the trinuclear T2 /T3 cluster, which binds oxygen molecules, 
reoxidation occurs via a four electron reductio n of dioxygen to water. Spectroscopic features 
of the laccases determined by UV/Vis or el ectron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) differ 
between the copper centres. The copper at the T1 site also known as ‘blue copper’ shows an absorption band in UV/Vis light at about 600 nm and an EPR spectrum. The T2 copper 
(‘normal copper’) shows no intense characterist ic in the visible spectrum, but comprise a 
copper like EPR signal. In contrast, the T3 copper pair displays an absorption maximum at 330nm but no EPR signal (Thurst on 1994, Solomon et al. 1996). 
Usually, laccases have a molecular weight  (MW) of approximately 60-85 kDa and are 
glycosylated to about 10-13% (Thurston 1994). Their isoelectric point (pI) is in the acidic pH range of 3.0 to 5.0 (Kilaru 2006), but also isolec tric points of above 6. 0 were reported such 
as for the laccase of 
Trametes hirsuta  which has a pI of 7.4 (Shin and Lee 2000). For 
biochemical characterisation of the laccases four standard substrates are used, which are listed in reviews describing laccase properties: ABTS, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP), guaiacol and syringaldazine (SGZ) (Baldrian 2006, Kila ru 2006). The optimal pH for oxidation varies 
among the substrates with values of 2.0 to 5.0,  3.0 to 8.0, 3.0 to 7.0 and 3.5 to 7.0 with 
median values of 3.0, 4.0, 4.5 and 6.0 for the substrates ABTS, DMP, guaiacol and SGZ, respectively (reviewed by Baldri an 2006). Nevertheless, also di fferent other substrates have 
been tested up to now showing the broad substrate variety of phenolic compounds and aromatic amines laccases can oxidise (Messerschmidt 1998, Baldrian 2006).  
This broad substrate range makes laccase an enzyme to be used in various applications, 
such as bleaching of paper pulp, production of wood composites and decolourisation of textile dyes, as well as for bioremediation of toxic and recalcitrant compounds (Felby et al. 1997, Kharazipour et al. 1997, Majcherczyk et  al. 1998, Johannes et al. 1998, Pointing 2001, 
Mai et al. 2004, Novotny et al. 2004, Fackler et al. 2008). Previous work described that 
Coprinopsis cinerea  possesses 17 different laccase genes that 
divide into two subfamilies (Kilaru et al. 2006) . The reason for this high number of laccase 
genes is not known, but one explanation might the that different laccases with various properties are required for different functions. Purification and characterisation of three new laccases from the basidiomycete C. cinerea  
 
 221Up to know, only the C. cinerea  laccase Lcc1 was purified and studied regarding its 
biochemical and structural characteristics (Yaver  et al. 1999, Schneider et al. 1999, Kilaru et 
al. in prep.). In this study, three further laccase genes of C. cinerea  were recombinantly 
expressed in the C. cinerea  strain FA2222 under the control of the Agaricus bisporus  gpdII  
promoter as previously described (Kilaru et al. 2006). The laccases Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7 were 
purified via Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) and characterised regarding optimal reaction conditions (pH,  temperature), stability and enzymatic kinetics. 
 
III. Material and Methods 
A. Fungal culture 
Laccase transformants over expressing laccase genes lcc5, lcc6 and lcc7 from C. cinerea  from 
a previous study (Kilaru 2006) were used for production of the corresponding protein. The 
clones with the highest laccase ac tivities were grown on YMG-agar (yeast extract: 4 g/l; malt 
extract: 10 g/l; glucose: 4 g/l; agar: 10 g/l)  plates at 37 °C until the mycelium reached the 
border of the Petri dish. Sterile dH 2O was poured onto the plate and the mycelium together 
with the asexual spores was scraped with a spatul a from the agar. The so lution was filtered 
using a sterile funnel filled with glass wool to hold back the fungal hyphae. A Thoma 
counting chamber was used to determine the spore concentration in the eluate. Pre-cultures were prepared in 500 ml flasks with 5 x 10
7 spores in 50 ml of modified Kjalke medium (after 
Kjalke et al. 1992, per litre: 10 g yeast extract, 20 g glucose, 0.5 g CaCl 2 x 2H 2O, 2 g 
KH2PO4, 50 mg MgSO 4 x 7H 2O). The flasks were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C as stationary 
(standing) cultures. Pre-cultures were homogenised by an Ultra-Turrax (IKA Werke GmbH & Co. KG, Staufen, Germany) for 30 sec at 8000 rpm and 30 sec at 9500 rpm. For the main-
cultures, 500 ml flasks were filled with 100 ml of modified Kjalke medium supplemented with 
0.1 mM CuSO
4 and inoculated with 5 ml of homogeni sed pre-culture. All cultures were 
incubated at 37 °C on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm until high laccase activity was detected in the supernatant.   
B. Purification 
At the day of highest laccase activities, the supernatants of the fungal cultures were 
collected by filtration with a suction filter  through Whatman No. 1 paper (Whatman, Dassel, 
Germany). The pH of the eluate was adjused to 6.4 with either HCl or NaOH and the laccase containing supernatant was cleared from myce lial fragments by centrifugation at 10000 g Chapter 5 
 222 (Beckman J2-HS, Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Ge rmany) and 4 °C for 30 min. To eliminate 
small particles able of blocking the FPLC-col umns, the supernatant was filtrated with a PALL 
filter cassette of 1 MDa (OMEGA™ membrane, Pall Cooporation, USA) . All chromatographic 
steps were performed with a GE Healthcare (formerly Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, 
Germany) ÄKTA FPLC chromatographic system  at pH 6.4. Two anion exchanging DEAE-
Sepharaose Fast Flow (diethylaminoethyl group) columns with diameters of 50 mm and 26 mm were used with a volume of 150 ml and 90  ml, respectively. A hydrophobic interaction 
chromatography (HIC) column step (Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow (high sub), Ø 26 mm, 80 ml) completed the purification.

After each chromatographic run, according to their laccase activity as determined with ABTS 
as a substrate (see Biochemical characterisati on) fractions were pooled and desalted using 
an Amicon ultrafiltration cell (Millipore GmbH, Eschborn, Germany) with a 10 kDa YM filter. 
Before loading the HIC column, a pooled laccas e containing solution was resalted with the 
appropriate loading buffer (LB: 20 mM KH 2PO4 + 1 M (NH 4)2SO4, Table 1).  
 Amounts of N-glycosylation of proteins were determined by deglycosylation with a peptide-N
4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (PNGase F, New England BioLabs Inc., 
Frankfurt Main, Germany). 20 µg of protein was incubated for 10 min at 100 °C in 1x denaturation buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% ß-mercaptoethanol), then 1/10 volume of the 10x G7 
buffer (0.5 M NaPO
4, pH 7.5), 1/10 volume of 10% NP-40 and 1500 U of PNGase F were 
added to the reaction mixture. After incubation at 37 °C for 60 min the deglycosylated 
protein samples were frozen at -20 °C and stored until further usage. 
 Purified laccase Lcc1 used for comparison with the laccases processed in this work was obtained from a previous study (Kilaru 2006).  Purification and characterisation of three new laccases from the basidiomycete C. cinerea

1. Electrophoresis 
For separation of proteins, polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed with 
4% stacking and 12% resolving gels:  4%: 2.5 ml of 0.5 M Tris pH 6.8, 1.3 ml acrylamide 
(37%), 100 µl 10% (w/v) SDS, 50 µl 10% (w/v) APS (ammonium peroxodisulfate, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), 10 µl TEMED (N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine, Amersham Bioscience AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and filled up to 10 ml with dH
2O. 12% : 2.5 ml 
of 1.5 M Tris pH 8.8, 4.0 ml acrylamide (37%), 100 µl 10% (w /v) SDS, 50 µl 10% (w/v) APS, 
5 µl TEMED and filled up to 10ml with dH 2O. 
 The loading buffer contained 0.06 M Tris-HCl  (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% 
bromphenol blue (w/v). Proteins were reduced by 10 mM DTT and denatured by boiling for 5 min. To determine the size of the denatured proteins, a molecular weight marker (#SM0431, 
Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) was used. Separation was performed at a constant current of 15 mA until the samples re ached the resolving gel and continued at 25 
mA for separation in the resolving gel. In nati ve electrophoresis, the proteins were neither 
reduced nor denatured.  
2. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) 
IEF was performed using non-denatured PAGE with a precast Clean Gel (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) rehydrated in carrier ampholytes (Pharmalyte: pH 2.5 – 5.0 
and Ampholine: pH 4.0 – 6.5). Supernatant of fungal cultures and the purified laccase samples (40 mU for native staining and 5 µg for Coomassie staini ng) were loaded onto filter 
paper pads, placed on the rehydrated gel and the run was performed on a Multiphor II system (Amersham-Pharmacia, Munich, Germ any). A low-pI marker kit (pH 2.8-6.5; 
Amersham-Pharmacia, Munich, Germany) was used to determine the pI values. Native staining was performed as described below wit h 5 mM MBTH (3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinon-
hydrazone hydrochloride) and 5 mM DHPPA (3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid).   
3. Staining 
For Coomassie staining, the gel was fixed in 12% TCA (trichloroacetic acid) (w/v) for at least 
1 h and stained in a colloidal Coomassie staining solution (10% phosphoric acid (v/v), 10% 
ammonium sulfate (w/v) and 0.12% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 (Serva electrophoresis Chapter 5 
 224 GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) (w/v) in water/methanol (80/20, v/v) solution) overnight. The 
gel was washed with water until the background level was reduced for an adequate band to 
background ratio. Silver-staining was pe rformed according to (Blum et al. 1987). 
  For native laccase staining, gels were washed  in 100 ml of 100 mM sodium acetate buffer 
(pH 5.0) for at least 10 min and then incubated with 5 mM MBTH (3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinon-hydrazone hydrochloride) and 5 mM DHPPA (3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid) in the same buffer.  To analyse the amount of the laccases in the supernatant, fluore scence staining was 
performed after the protocol of Lamanda et al . (Lamanda et al. 2004). Gels were fixed in 
10% acetic acid (v/v), 30% EtOH (v/v) overnight and stained afterwards with 1 µM RuBP [ruthenium II tris (bathophenantroline disulf onate)] (Rabilloud et al. 2001). The gel was 
washed twice with dH
2O and scanned using a fluorescence reader FLA-5100 (Fujifilm, 
Düsseldorf, Germany) with 50 µm resolution. 16 bit reader files were converted to TIF-
format using AIDA image analyser (v4.10.0 20, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The 
calibration curve for the determination of the protein amount was obtained by applying BSA 
standards (1.2 µg, 1.0 µg, 0.7 µg, 0.4 µg and 0.2 µg of protein per lane) separated parallel to the samples on the same gel. An AIDA image analyzer was used for gel processing and calculating total protein. The following para meters were used: baseline determination at 
search level 1, smooth parameter 10 pixel and search level 0 for peak determination (not 
smooth). Integration parameters for BSA bands were set manually to prevent any distortion of the protein measurements by BSA contamin ations. The resulting calibration curve (R
2 = 
0.9675 for Lcc5 and R2 = 0.9881 for Lcc6 and Lcc7) was used for calculation of laccase 
amounts in the purified laccase solutions.  The corresponding laccase bands in the 
supernatant samples were used fo r determination of the secretio n amount [mg/l] of laccases 
in the fungal samples. Silver-staining was performed acco rding to (Blum et al. 1987). 
 
4. Protein identification 
Protein bands of the Coomassie- stained gel were cut with a razo r blade and gel pieces were 
digested as described by Havlis and Shevchenko  (2004) with some modifications. Briefly, gel 
pieces were washed twice with water for 15 mi n and subsequently on ce with 50 % ethanol 
for destaining. Gel pieces were dehydrated wit h 100 % acetonitril for 20 min and dried in a Purification and characterisation of three new laccases from the basidiomycete C. cinerea  
 
 225vacuum centrifuge (Concentrator 5301, Eppe ndorf, Wesseling-Berzdorf, Germany) for 10 
min. Subsequently the gel pieces were  s o a k e d  i n  2  µ M  t r y p s i n  i n  5 0  m M  
ammoniumbicarbonate buffer (pH 8) at 4 °C for 1 h and digested for 30 min at 58 °C. 
Peptides were extracted from the gel pieces on a shaker first with 150 µl 5% (v/v) formic 
acid for one hour, followed by two extractions with 150 µl 5 % formic acid, 50% acetonitril. 
Extracts were combined, dried in the vacuum centrifuge to total dryness and stored at -20 
°C until further proceeding. For further processi ng, peptides were dissolved in 15 µl of 5 % 
formic acid and 3 times 4 µl were injected to  a 12 cm capillary column packed with 3 µm 
paticles of Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ (Dr. Maisch  GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) for peptide 
separation. Analysis of the peptides was pe rformed by ESI-LC-MS (HP 1100 Agilent; Esquire 
3000, Bruker Daltonik). Each sample was analys ed in a mass range of the ion trap from 200 
to 1500 m/z. Analysis of the raw data was done with Daltonic Data Analysis version 3.0 
(Bruker Daltonic GmbH; Bruker Daltonic esquir e 5.0). Proteins were identified by searching 
the data against a database of the annotated genome of C. cinerea  using local Mascot 
software (www.matrixscience.co m). The following settings were used for the database 
search: fixed modification: carb amidomethylation; variable modification: oxidation; peptide 
mass tolerance: 1.4 Da; peptide charge: 1+,2 + and 3+; MS/MS tolerance: 0.4 Da; missed 
cleavages allowed: 1. For final identification and predicted function protein BLAST against 
NCBI database, PFAM (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/), and Interpro 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) were used.  
D. Biochemical characterisation 
Laccase activity was determined in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at room 
temperature with the following substrates: ABTS  (2,2‘-azino-bis-[3-e thylbenzthiazoline-6-
sulfonate]), DMP (2,6-dimethoxyphenol), guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol) and syringaldazine 
(SGZ, 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde azine). The conversion of the substrate was 
monitored spectroscopically at 420 nm ( ε = 36000 M –1 cm-1), 468 nm ( ε = 49600 M –1 cm-1), 
436 nm ( ε = 6400 M –1 cm-1)  and 526 nm ( ε = 65000 M –1 cm-1) for ABTS, DMP, guaiacol 
and syringaldazine, respectively (Matsumura et al. 1986, Wariishi et al. 1992, Slomczynski et 
al. 1995, Eggert et al. 1996). One unit of enzy me activity was defined as the amount of 
enzyme oxidising 1 µmol substrate per min. 
The spectrum of the purified and complete ly oxidised laccases was determined with a 
Beckman DU800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter GmbH, Krefeld, Germany).  
 Chapter 5 
 2261. Optimal reaction conditions 
The optimal pH of the laccases was determined for the above listed substrates in the 
following buffers: universal buffer pH 2.0, 3.0 – 12.0; McIlvaine buffer pH 2.5, 3.0 – 7.0; 
acetate buffer pH 3.6, 4.1 – 5.6; phosphate buffer  pH 5.8, 6.4, 7.0, 7.6 and 8.0; borat buffer 
pH 7.8, 8.3 – 9.8 (Rauen 1964). For pH stab ility, approximately 150 mU laccases were 
incubated in 1 ml universal buffer (2.0 – 12.0) up to 24 h, samples were taken in defined 
time intervals and activity was measured wit h ABTS in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 
5.0). For the optimal temperature of the laccases, activity was determined at 10 °C, 20 °C – 80 °C in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6)  with ABTS as a substrate. The temperature 
was measured inside a reference cuvette to  guarantee a correct determination of the 
temperature. The thermal stab ility was analysed by incubating the laccases in 100 mM 
sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6) at 10 °C, 30 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C over a period of 3 h. 
Samples were taken at different time intervals and the laccase activity was determined in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) with ABTS as a substrate at room temperature.  
2. Enzyme kinetics 
Michaelis-Menten constant Km, Vmax and cataly tic efficiency (kcat/Km) were defined with 
laccases Lcc5, Lcc6, Lcc7 and Lcc1 for all the above mentioned substrates. The substrates 
were applied in concentrations  around the estimated Km value and measurement points of 
at least eight different substrate concentrations were chosen for the determination of the Km 
and Vmax value according to the linear re gression after Lineweaver-Burk (SOFTmax® PRO, 
Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA).  
 
3. Stability of laccases against inhibitors and in organic solvents 
Inhibitors for laccase activity were dissolved in sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0, 100 mM) to 
different concentrations. The purified laccases  were incubated for 2 min in the inhibitor 
solution and activity was measured with ABTS as described above. To test  the stability of the 
laccases against organic solven ts, 50 µl of laccases were mixed with 450 µl of acetonitrile 
(ACN) and ethanol (EtOH) to final concentr ations of 9%, 18%, 45% and 90% v/v. The 
mixture was incubated and measured with ABTS as described above over a defined time 
period (1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 24 h). Laccase mixed with water served as a control.

 2274. Dye decolourisation 
Different industrial dyes were used to te st the ability of the purified laccase for 
decolourisation. Seven different dyes were kind ly provided by the department for Bioprocess 
Engineering (Prof. Bley) at the Technical Univer sity of Dresden: Levafix Blue E-RA gran., 
Levafix Blue PN-3R, Procion Blue H-EGN 125, Remzol Black B gran. 133%, Remazol Golden 
Yellow 3R liq 25, Remazol Brilliant Red 5B 150% , Remazol Turquoise Blue G133. Solution of 
the dyes were prepared accord ing to Böhmer et al. (2006): 250 mg of the dye was dissolved 
in 50 ml water (5 g/l) followed by addition of 10 g of Na 2SO4. Thereafter, the pH was 
adjusted to 12 with 1 M NaOH, the stock soluti on was heated for 1 h at 80 °C and chilled to 
room temperature before usage. For decolouris ation experiments in wa ter, the dyes were 
used in a final concentration of approximately 50 mg/l, except for Remazol Golden Yellow 
which was used in a concentration of 500 mg/l . Laccases were used with a final activity of 
approximately 2.0 U/mg dye, except for Remazol Golden Yellow where laccases were used in 
a concentration of 0.2 U/mg dye. In addition to the purified laccases of C. cinerea , Trametes 
versicolor  laccase (Tv_lac) from Novozymes A/S (Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was used in this 
experiment. For determination of  the decolourisation rate, a spectrum of the dye-laccase 
solution was monitored with a sp ectrophotometer (SpectraMax 340PC384, Molecular Devices, 
Sunnyvale, CA). The decolourisation rate wa s calculated after the reduction of the 
absorbance at the dye specific wavelength: λ = 614 nm for Levafix Blue E-RA gran., λ = 586 
for Levafix Blue PN-3R, λ = 624 nm for Procion Blue H-EGN 125 and λ = 620 nm for 
Remazol Turqoise Blue G133.  
5. Redox potential determination 
The redox potential of the Cu(I) of the purified laccase Lcc5 (34 µM) was determined in 20 mM KH
2PO4 buffer pH 6.4 at room temperat ure under anaerobic conditions (N 2) with a 
Mediator Mix of a total concentration of 1 µM (methyl viologen, neutral red, safranine, anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, phenazine, indigo carmine, 
resorufin, duroquinone, methylene blue, juglone, 1,4-naphthoquinone, N-methylphenazonium methyl sulfate, 1,2-naphthoquinone). Stepwise oxidation and reduction were performed by anaerobic titration with 10 mM  hexacyanoferrat(III) and 5 mM ascorbate, 
respectively. The absorbance at 610 nm was recorded by a S2000 fibre optic spectrometer 
(Ocean Optics) with a deuterium-tungsten haloge n light source (Mikropa ck) and the potential 
of the reaction solution was measured using an EMC 50 Ag/AgCl electrode (Sensortechnik, Chapter 5 
 228 Meinsberg, Germany). All reco rded potentials were correct ed for the normal hydrogen 
electrode (NHE).  
 
IV. Results 
A. Purification 
The supernatants of the laccase transformants Lcc6, Lcc7 and Lcc5 cultivated in modified Kjalke medium supplemented with 0.1 mM CuSO
4 showed laccase activities of 5.1 U/ml, 
2.0 U/ml, and 25.0 U/ml when harvested for purification, respectively. Three 
chromatographic steps were needed for purification of the laccases. An anion exchanger (DEAE Sepharose) column (Ø 50 mm, 150 ml) wa s used for a preliminary crude purification 
step (Fig. 1A) followed by a second anion exchanger (DEAE Sepharose) column (Ø 26 mm, 90 ml) (Fig. 1B). These two chromatographic step s resulted in an incr ease of the specific 
activity of two times for Lcc5 and more than 3 times for Lcc6 and Lcc7, respectively (Table 2). Finally, a hydrophobic interact ion chromatographic (HIC) step, which was 
performed on a Phenyl Sepharose column (Fig. 1C), yielded a blue coloured laccase solution with specific laccase activities of 795 U/mg, 247 U/mg and 91 U/mg for Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7, respectively. Subsequent purification steps wit h a high resolution anion exchanger (MonoQ) 
and size exclusion chromatography (gel filt ration) columns could not further improve the 
purity of the laccase solutions.   Besides the specific activity of the different pu rification steps, Table 2 shows also the yield 
defined by the residual laccase activity compared to the activity in the supernatant and it shows the final purification factor, which varied between 3 and 4. The yield of 62%, 43% 
and 55% for laccases Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7 showed that around half the laccase activity got 
lost during the purification steps.

* This value is likely due to a pipetting error in sample taking during the process of enzyme purification. 
Remeasuring the laccase activity of the frozen sample confirmed the result of total laccase activity. 
 
For comparison of the different laccases and the quality of the purification steps, SDS-PAGE 
with native and with denatured samples was performed. The results of the purification steps are documented for Lcc7 as an example in the reduced SDS-PAGE gel in Fig. 2A. The main band in the supernatant (Fig. 2A lane 1) is the recombinantly produced laccase Lcc7 having a size of ~63 kDa. Purified Lcc5 and Lcc6 had a single band (Fig. 2A lane 7 and 8) indicating a little smaller size of ~62 kD a (see below). The results of the corresponding native SDS-
PAGE is shown in Fig. 2B where the three laccases showed different running patterns with one slower migrating band for Lcc7 and one faster migrating band for Lcc7 and two intermediate migrating bands for Lcc6 (Fig. 2B lanes 6 to 8).

lanes 5-8: 0.5 µg of protein were loaded. Native PAGE: 20 mU of laccase activity per lane. 
 
The amount of recombinant laccase secreted into the medium was determined by 
fluorescence staining with RuBP of a SDS-PAGE  gel (not shown). The calculated values are 
given in Table 3 and vary between the differen t laccases from 115 mg/l for Lcc5 and around 
28 to 27 mg/l for Lcc6 and Lcc7, respectively. The percentage of laccase in the supernatant compared to the total protein amount was also  calculated from the fluorescence stained 
SDS-PAGE giving a very high value of 86% for Lcc5 and somewhat lower fractions of 63% and 62% for Lcc6 and Lcc7, respectively. In the purified laccase samples, faint bands of protein below the main laccase bands occurred (Fig. 3), which accounts for 4%, 5% and 3% of total protein in the purified laccase samples of Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7, respectively. LC/MS-MS analysis of the faint band in the Lcc7 sample suggests that they are at least partially due to degradation products (data not shown).

 232 B. Molecular characteristics 
The MW of the purified laccases and of P NGaseF-treated laccase was compared by SDS-
PAGE (Fig. 3) and calculated according to MW values of standard proteins. The MWs of the 
purified laccases were determined to be 62 kDa, 61-62 kDa and 63 kDa for Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7. respectively. Upon PNGaseF treatment, the molecular weight decreased to 61 kDa, 
59 kDa and 60 kDa for Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7, respectively. Accordingly, the N-glycosylation amount of the total molecular weight accounts for 2% for Lcc5, 4% for Lcc6 and 5% for Lcc7. 
 
 Fig. 3  SDS-PAGE of purified laccase Lcc5 (lanes 1 and 2), Lcc6 (lanes 3 and 4) and Lcc7 (lanes 5 and 6) with 
(lanes 1, 3 and 5) and without (lanes 2, 4 and 6) tr eatment of PNGaseF. The gel was stained with silver. 
 
Isoelectric focusing (IEF) of the purified laccases showed one major laccase band for all 
laccases when stained with the laccase substrates MBTH and DHPPA, whereas with Coomassie staining at least two bands became visible for all three of the laccases. Lcc7 
showed two bands of similar intensity with pI va lues of 4.1 and 4.2, whereas the major band 
for Lcc6 and Lcc5 had pI values of 3.7 and 3.5, respectively, and their minor bands both pI values of 3.6 (Fig. 4).   M        1    2         3   4

Fig. 4  Isoelectric focusing (IEF) of C. cinerea  purified laccases Lcc7 (1 and 2), Lcc6 (3 and 4) and Lcc5 (5 and 6). 
5 µg proteins were loaded for lanes stained with Coomassie (M, 2, 4, 6) and 40 mU for the lanes stained with the 
laccase substrate MBTH and DHPPA (1, 3, 5). The pI mark er (lane M) was used to calculate unknown pI values 
of the purified laccases. The pI values of the main bands are underlined. pI values derived from two different IEF 
experiments and the error is ± 0.1 pI. 
 
The UV/Vis spectrum of the three laccases Lc c5, Lcc6 and Lcc7 (Fig. 5) shows the typical 
absorbance of the oxidised Cu(I ) centre at 610 nm. As in stud ies with other laccases (Garzillo 
et al. 2001), the absorption of the T3 Cu(II) at 330 nm was badly resolved. The resolution of 
the UV/Vis band of the T3 Cu(II) at 330 nm is not visible in the spectra of Lcc5 and Lcc7 in 
Fig. 5; only in Lcc6 a small should er can be seen at about 330 nm.  Chapter 5

C.  Biochemical characterisation using st andard laccase substrates 
The optimal pH for enzymatic activity of the purified laccases was tested with the universal 
buffer within a pH range of 2.0 to 12.0 at room temperature using the four most studied laccase substrates: ABTS, DMP, guaiacol and SG Z (syringaldazine). For ABTS, the optimal pH 
for laccase activity was 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0 for the laccases Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7, respectively. For DMP, guaiacol and SGZ, the optimal pHs were found to vary between 6.0 and 7.0 (Table 4).   The pH stability of the laccases incubated in universal  buffer (pH 2.0 to 12.0) was shown to 
be better in the more alkaline range. More than 50 % of the initial activity was retained in 
pH ranges of 7.0 to 11.0, 8.0 to 11.0 and 8.0 to 9.0 for laccases Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7, 
respectively. The optimal temperature revealed t o  b e  5 0  ° C  f o r  a l l  t e s t e d  l a c c a s e s .  T h e

 236 Michaelis-Menten kinetics were determined for four substrates (ABTS, DMP, guaiacol and 
SGZ) and the four enzymes (Lcc1, Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7) with substrate concentrations above and below the estimated K
m values (Table 5). At least eight different points of measurement 
were used for determining the K m and V max value according to Lineweaver Burk with linear 
plots whose coefficients of determination (R2) were between 0.961 and 0.999 for the 
obtained data (Table 5). Lcc1 had the highest affinity towards the substrates - low Michaelis-Menten constants (K
m) - with values of 656 µM, 199 µM, 855 µM and 289 µM for ABTS, DMP, 
guaiacol and SGZ, respectively (Table 5). Lcc6 and Lcc7 with high K m v a l u e s  w e r e  m o r e

substance guaiacol which showed a very low affinity to Lcc5. Generally, SGZ showed low Km values, compared to the other three substrates, for all tested laccases. Highest V
max values 
were also obtained with SGZ for all tested laccases, except for Lc c6 which showed the 
highest V max value with ABTS. The catalytical efficiency (k cat/Km), which is an indicator for the 
performance of a enzymatic reaction, varied between the subtrates for each laccases. At all, Lcc1 showed the highest catalytical efficiency towards the tested substrates with values of 126 mM/min, 310 mM/min and 14 mM/min for ABTS, DMP and guaiacol, respectively; except for SGZ, where Lcc7 had the highest value wit h 1413 mM/min (Table 5). Overall, guaiacol 
showed the lowest catalytical efficiencies with values of around 2 to 14 mM/min and SGZ the 
highest values ranging from 125 mM to 1413 mM/min.

 237Another value to describe the quality of a lacca se reaction is its redo x potential, which is 
generally measured for the T1 copper atom in laccases as it is involved in the oxidation of 
the substrate (Xu 1996, Riva 2006). The oxidatio n state of the copper atom (CuI/CuII) was 
determined via the absorbance of the CuII at 610 nm and the oxidation state changed via 
redox titration with ascorbate (5mM) and hexacyannoferrat (10mM) at a pH of 6.4 (Fig. 7). 
The reduction and oxidation curves of the re dox titration of Lcc5 revealed differences 
between both steps performed with a transition point for the oxidation curve being around 50 mV lower than for the reductio n curves (Fig. 7B). Actually, oxidation and reduction curves 
should overlap each other, as shown for the determination of the redox potential for the T1 copper of the plant 
Rhus vernicifera  laccase (Reinhammar 1972). This was not achieved in 
this study, although we repeated the measurements. Nevertheless, the graphical determination using either the Nernst plot (Fig . 7A) as well as oxidation and reduction curves 
(Fig. 7B) revealed an average redox potential of 542 mV with a standard deviation of 20 mV, which is in the range of standard deviations ac hieved for redox potentials of laccases (Xu et 
al. 1998, Durão et al. 2008).

 239D. Stability against inhibitors  and organic solvents 
Inhibition of laccases by various chemicals di ssolved in sodium acet ate buffer (pH 5.0, 
100 mM) revealed differences between the enzymes. The chelator EDTA up to a 
concentration of 40 mM did not show high inhibition effects in contrast to the compounds binding directly to the copper  atoms in the laccases NaN
3 (0.1 mM) and NaF (10 mM), which 
both reduced the laccase activity of Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7 to more than 50% and 80%, respectively (Table 6). For Lcc1, inhibition by 0.1 mM NaN
3 and 10 mM NaF was lower with 
values of 27 % and 47% as compared  to the other enzymes (Table 6).

The stability of the purified la ccases in ACN and EtOH was tested for different solvent 
concentrations (final concentrations: 9%, 18%, 45% and 90%; Fig 8). Compared to water, the instable enzymes Lcc6 and Lcc7 showed an even lower stability in all tested ACN and EtOH concentrations. Even at the low concentrat ion of 9% EtOH as the best situation, only 
60% and less than 40% of the activity from Lcc6 and Lcc7 remained after 4 h, respectively. After 24 h, no laccase activity remained in a ll Lcc6 and Lcc7 solutions, regardless of being 
just water or containing organic solvents. For Lcc1 and Lcc5 being highly stable in water, incubation at lower ACN and EtOH concentrations (9% and 18%, respectively) had less dramatic effects on protein stability. Lcc1 retain ed more than 50% of its activity after 4 h in 
ACN and ethanol at concentrations of up to 18% and up to 45%, respectively. Also after 
24 h of incubation, considerable amount of enzy matic activity were still present in samples of 
up to 18% solvent concentration. Protein Lc c5 had an even better stability in organic 
solvents than Lcc1. Lcc5 maintained 50% of it s activity after 24 h when incubated in up to 
18% ACN and 45% EtOH, respectively. Moreover, after 24 h 25% activity was still present in 
the sample of 90% EtOH concentration. With ACN concentrations of 45% and 90%, after 4 h incubation there was still laccase activity of about 55% and 30%, respectively. However, at these high ACN concentrations, after 24 h all enzymatic activity was lost. Chapter 5

 241E. Reactions with industrial dyes 
Seven different industrial dyes were tested with the four purified C. cinerea  laccases as well 
as with a commercial T. versicolor  laccase (Tv_lac, Novozymes A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). 
Only four dyes (all blue dyes) could be decolo urised to different extends (Fig. 9). Levafix 
Blue E-RA got completely deco lourised after 24 h by all test ed laccases. However, Tv_lac 
showed best results and reacted very fast with the dye directly upon mixing (Fig. 9A). This 
was also seen for Procion Blue, where during the first measurement (5 min after the start of the experiment) already 30-70% of the dye solution was decolourised; although, Procion Blue could not be degraded completely (F ig. 9C). Levafix Blue RN was degraded by 
C. cinerea  laccases to a very low amount, but almost completely by the T. versicolor  laccase 
(Fig. 9D). Degradation of the Turqoise dy e between 5 min and 24 h was very low with 
approximately only 2% for all C. cinerea  laccases, but 20% for Tv_lac (Fig. 9D).

of incubation (light grey) and after 24 h of incubation (white). Averages and standard deviations were calculated 
from each three parallel samples. Note that the turquoise dye samples ( D) with Lcc5 were lower in absorbance 
already at the beginning of the experiment (5min after addition of the dye) possibly due to a pipetting error. Procion Blue

Crystals of the purified laccase Lcc5 were produced by Anja Pomowski, who also revealed 
the crystallographic structure of the complete enzyme Lcc5 (title page of chapter 5, p.213). 
The structure of the copper clusters, which is presented in Fig. 10B, was generated within 
this study with the PyMOL software (DeLano 2007 ) using the structural data provided by 
Anja Pomowski. We calculated the distances of the copper atoms towards each other and its ligands with the same software. All ligands had similar distances towards their copper atoms of about 2 Å, whereas the cysteine at the T1 site showing the highest distance of 2.2Å. The distances between the three copper atoms distributed over the trinuclear copper cluster T2/T3 were between 3.9 and 4.0 Å.

 243V. Discussion 
A. Molecular structure of enzymes produced by the different C. ciner ea 
laccase genes 
In this study, three different recombinantly produced C. cinerea  laccases (Lcc5, Lcc6 and 
Lcc7) were characterised the first time concerning molecular, biochemical and, in case of 
Lcc5, also structural features. Furthermore, for the previously characterised enzyme Lcc1 
(Kilaru 2006) Michealis-Menten kinetics as well as stability against laccase inhibitors and in 
organic solvents were determined.  The molecu lar weight of 61-63 kD a determined for the 
laccases by SDS-PAGE is within the normal range for laccase molecules, although the 
amount of N-glycosylation (2-5% for the laccases tested in this study, Table 4) is quite low 
compared to other laccases (Thurston 1994, Kila ru 2006). To the best of my knowledge, only 
for P. ostreatus  POXA1, P. eryngii  Laccase II, C. cinerea  Lcc1 and two Fomes sclerodermus  
laccase isoforms, similarly low glycosylation amo unts of below 5% were detected (Palmieri et 
al. 1997, Munoz et al. 1997, Papinutti and Martin ez 2006, see section 4.I). In the literature, 
most of the studies describe only the degree of N-glycosylation of laccases (Palmieri et al. 
1997, Min et al. 2001, Ko et al. 2001, Nagai et al. 2002, de la Rubia et al. 2002, Saparrat et al. 2002, Xiao et al. 2003), whereas only in few studies the total poly saccharide content was 
determined (Perie et al. 1998, Schliephake et al. 2000, Galhaup et al. 2002) or the composition of the sugars was studied (Mi nuth et al. 1978, Lyashenko et al. 2006). O-
glycosylation may be present in 
C. cinerea  laccases, as suggested by crystal structure of 
C. cinerea  type-2-copper-depleted laccase Lcc1  (Ducros et al. 1998). Such extra O-
glycosylation could lead to a polysaccharide cont ent which is higher than the values of 3%, 
2%, 4% and 5% determined for laccases Lcc1, L cc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7 by deglycosylation of the 
N-linked polysaccharides, respectively. The enzymes have 1 to 4 potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 11). The theoretical MW of the ma ture enzymes Lcc1, Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7 (see 
Fig. 11 for sequences) are 58.4 kDa, 57.5 kD a, 57.5 kDa and 60.0 kDa, respectively. In 
comparison, the experimentally determined va lues were 61 kDa, 61 kDa, 59 kDa and 60 
kDa, respectively (Table 4, Fig. 3 and Kilaru  2006). Thus, only for Lcc7 the theoretical and 
experimental MW are similar. The differences of  about 2.5 kDa in case of the other threee 
sequences might be due to sugars still present at  the N-glycosylation sites, which are still not 
cleaved by the PNGaseF enzyme (Lcc1, Lcc5, Lcc6  and Lcc7 have 3, 1, 3 and 4 glycosylation 
sites, respectively, determined with NetNGlyc1.0 Server, www.cbs.dtu.dk
, Fig. 11) or due to 
O-glycosylation of the protein, which was not analysed in this work. Interestingly, Lcc5, 
which showed the highest difference between the theoretical and experimental MW  Chapter 5

Further studies on the crystal-structures of Lcc5 (see below) might give a better insight into 
the glycosylation pattern of Lcc5. 
 
SDS-PAGE of denatured purified laccase lead to only one band for all laccases, whereas 
samples in native PAGE showed two bands for Lcc6, but only one major band in IEF for this laccase (compare Fig. 2 and Fig. 5). Unlike the other 
C. cinerea  enzymes, Lcc6 has six 
cysteines (Fig. 11): One of which (Cys487) should take part in copper binding of the T1 centre. Four others (Cys109, Cys147, Cys2 34, Cys521) by analogy of structurally 
characterised enzymes (Lcc1 of 
C. cinerea , Yaver et al. 1999; laccase of T. versicolor , 
Jönsson et al. 1995; laccase of Cerrena maxima , Lyashenko et al. 2006d) should contribute 
to stability due to the formation of disulfide brid ges. Cys532 is located at the C-terminal end, 
eleven amino acids downstream of Cys521, and might alternatively act to Cys521 in disulfide 
bridging with Cys 147 giving a possible explanation for the two bands of Lcc6 in native gel electrophoresis.  On the other hand, Lcc7 had only one very strong band in native PAGE and IEF, when stained with DHPPA and MBTH, but two bands of similar strength in IEF when stained with 
Coomassie (Fig. 2 and 4). Likewise, Lcc5 had on ly one band in native PAGE that resolved 
into two of different intensity in IEF (Fig. 2 and 4). In case of Lcc6, there was one major 
band in IEF at a pI of 3.7 and a very faint band at a pI of 3.6. The selective staining of the two bands, however, did not match to the more equal staining of the two bands obtained in native PAGE (compare Fig. 2 and Fig. 4). Fina lly, Kilaru (2006) presented for enzyme Lcc1 
one major band with a pI of 3.8. Theoretical pIs for the native enzy mes are 5.17, 4.71, 5.00 
and 5.18 for 
C. cinerea  laccases Lcc1, Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7, respectively (calculated by the 
pI/MW tool of ExPASy - www.expasy.org ). These pI values differ by 1.0 to 1.4 from the 
experimental determined values. In the nati ve enzymes, amino acids projected to the 
surface of the folded proteins should account for the actual pI values. Slight changes in the folding on the enzyme surface might be the re ason for obtaining isof orms with different pIs 
from a given enzyme. Generally, the experimental  determined pI values of Lcc1, Lcc5, Lcc6 
and Lcc7 are within the range of pI values for known laccases, which differ between pI 2.65 and 3.0 for 
Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  laccases (Schliephake et al. 2000) up to values of pI 6.7 
for POXA1 and pI 6.9 for POXA1b of P. ostreatus  (Palmieri et al. 1997, Garzillo et al. 2001) 
and pI 7.4 for Trametes hirsuta  laccase (Shin and Lee 2000). Different banding pattern on 
native PAGE and IEF has been described previo usly for some other basidiomycete laccases. 
Purified laccase from Coriolopsis gallica  for example showed four bands in PAGE analysis, Chapter 5 
 246 whereas in IEF only 3 bands were observed  (Calvo et al. 1998), meaning that two 
isoenzymes/isoforms probably have the same pI value. Various reasons can account for the 
observation of different banding patterns in non-denaturing PAGEs of laccases from a single 
gene. Different banding might be due to th e occurrence of isoforms, different post-
translational modifications, differences in the oxidation state of the enzyme, partly 
proteolysed enzymes or dimers of the same protein (Calvo et al. 1998, Min et al. 2001, Machczynski et al. 2004). From our data, we do not have evidence of dimerisation for any of the four characterised proteins for different po st-translational modifications (Fig. 2, 4 and 
Kilaru 2006). Yaver et al. (1999) reported for Lcc1 recombinantly produced in 
Aspergillus 
oryzae  that the C-terminus was processed – whether this is the case in C. cinerea  is not 
known.   
B. Efficiency of the laccase production by th e different laccase genes 
The amount of secreted laccase in the supernatant, which was calculated by dividing the total laccase activity in the supernatant with the specific laccase activity of the purified 
enzyme (Table 2), varied between transforma nts with values of 25 mg/l, 32 mg/l, 16 mg/l 
and 22 mg/l for lacacses Lcc1, Lcc5, Lcc6 and Lcc7, respectively (Table 2 and Kilaru 2006). 
Higher values for amounts of secreted enzymes where obtained when using fluorescence 
staining of SDS-PAGEs of the supernatant. For the supernatant of the different laccase transformants values of 81 mg/l, 115 mg/l, 28  mg/l and 27 mg/l for laccases Lcc1, Lcc5, 
Lcc6 and Lcc7 were determined, respectively. One possible explanation of the discrepancy between values calculated after protein purification and values derived from fluorescence staining might be e.g. too high protein concentration values determ ined via the Bradford 
assay in the culture supernatant. Previously it  was shown that the Bradford assay might be 
affected by phenolic compounds produced by f ungal organisms (Whiffen et al. 2007, Roberts 
and Jones 2008). A too high measured protein concentration would lead  to redcued values 
for the specific laccase activity and, thus , to lower secretion amounts. Additionally, 
calculations of the secreted protein amount fr om laccase activity and Bradford assay do not 
include non-active enzymes (e.g. apoenzymes ), which would be detected by SDS-PAGE. 
Thus, the amount of secreted enzymes calculated via the specific activity of the purified 
enzyme might be smaller than the actual laccase amounts.  
 Generally, Lcc1 and particularly Lcc5 proved to be much more stable than Lcc6 and Lcc7 (Fig. 8, Table 4). All proteins were recombinantly produced by transformants of 
C. cinerea  
FA2222 containing the respective in troduced laccase gene behind the A. bisporus gpdII  Purification and characterisation of three new laccases from the basidiomycete C. cinerea  
 
 247promoter (Kilaru 2006). Different transformant s of the same construct vary in overall 
enzymatic activity, due to random integration of the gene into the fungal genome (Kilaru et 
al. 2006). However, there was a tendency in C. cinerea  transformation to obtain more 
positive FA2222 transformants with higher activiti es in liquid shaken cultures when using the 
gene lcc5 than when using genes lcc1, lcc6 and lcc7 (Kilaru 2006). Always the best 
transformant of Kilaru (2006) was chosen for this study out of up to 12 clones per gene. 
Although there will certainly be some difference in total mRNA production from the A. 
bisporus  promoter due to the different places of integration, the very different amounts of 
enzymatic activity obtained fr om the different transformants will likely be to large parts due 
to the better overall stability of Lcc1 and Lcc5.  
C. Stability of recombinantly  produced enzymes 
All tested C. cinerea  lacacses showed similar thermal stability at 50 °C remaining at least 
50% of their starting activity after 20 to 60 min (Table 4). This is in the range of fungal laccases, which show a half life at this temper ature between several minutes to up to more 
than two days (reviewed by Baldrian 2006). The pH-stability of fungal laccases is normally 
higher at a more acidic pH (Leonowicz et al. 1984, Kilaru 2006). Nevertheless, 
C. cinerea  
seems to have at least four different lacc ases which are more stable in the alkaline 
environment (Table 4). Few examples for laccases  of basidiomycetes being stable at alkaline 
pH can be found in the literature. In Daedalea quercina , highest laccase stability was 
observed at pH 6.0 and above with only 3% loss  of its activity after 24 h (Baldrian 2004) and 
Pleurotus pulmonarius  Lcc2 was stated to be very stable in a range between pH 4 and 10 
(De Souza and Peralta 2003). C. cinerea  has the behaviour to increase the pH of a culture 
medium up to pH 9.0 (Navarro-González 2008, se ction 4.II). Accordingl y, adaptation of its 
enzymes in tolerance towards this alkaline pH  should be favourable for the fungus. How 
about the pH range of activity? The optimal pH for activity of the laccases tested in this study was found to be below their optimal pH stability range which was determined to be for 
C. cinerea  laccases around pH 7 to 11 for all tested laccases (Table 4). Enzymes of other 
species are often better active in the acidic pH range which can be seen in the review of Baldrian (2006), who calculated the median for th e optimal pH of up to 36 different laccases, 
showing median values of pH 3.0, 4.0, 4.5 and 6.0 for the substrates ABTS, DMP, guaiacol and SGZ, respectively. Nevertheless, the total range of optimal pH varies drastically among laccases between pH 2.0 to 5.0 for ABTS, pH  3.0 and 8.0 for DMP, pH 2.0 and 7.5 for 
guaiacol and pH 3.5 to 7.0 for SGZ (Baldrian 2006, Kilaru 2006). In comparison to this, for all four characterised laccases the pH optima for the phenolic substrates (DMP, guaiacol and Chapter 5 
 248 SGZ) is in the neutral slightly acidic range (T able 4). Because of the higher stability in an 
alkaline pH range and since their pH-range for phenolic substrates is in a more or less 
neutral range, usages where alkali-resistant laccases are needed would be suitable for C. 
cinerea  enzymes, e.g. in the treatment of wastewater from dyeing processes (Soares et al. 
2006). Contradictory in the acidic pH range, at pH 2 the laccases are very unstable since no 
activity or only 3% of the activity remained after 20 min for Lcc6 and Lcc7. Also at pH 3, Lcc6 lost more than 96% of the remaining activity after 20 min, whereas Lcc7 remained almost 50% of its activity (data not shown). Su ch a lower stability as found for enzymes Lcc6 
and Lcc7 was already observed for a 
Cerrena unicolor laccase (Gianfreda et al. 1998).  
 Stability testing is not only restricted to pH  and temperature. In several studies in the 
literature, the characterised laccases are anal ysed regarding their stability in presence of 
laccase inhibitors (Table 7) because of the usage of inhibitors in applications were laccases might be used, such as EDTA in the paper an d pulp industry (Lapierre et al. 1995) and 
Naf/NaN
3 in the food industry (Lee et al. 2008). Resistance against known laccase inhibitors 
for the C. cinerea  laccases is different compared to other laccases described in the literature, 
for example Trametes  and Pleurotus  laccases which are found to  be relatively sensitive 
against NaN 3 (Table 7). In contrast, the ascomycete  Aspergillus nidulans  laccase was as the 
C. cinerea  laccases also very stable against NaN 3 with 49% of the activity remaining (Scherer 
and Fischer 1998). Howe ver, resistance of A. nidulans  laccase against NaF (66% remaining 
laccase activity) was better than resistance of all four C. cinerea  enzymes whereas resistance 
of the A. nidulans  enzyme against EDTA was much lower (Table 7). In the industry, a good 
stability of laccase against inhibitors could be of  special interest in in dustrial processes were 
fluorides (e.g. food industry) or EDTA (paper industry) are needed.

 249Besides the stability against inhibitor molecules, the stability and reactivity of laccases in 
organic solvents is interesting for industrial techniques when substrates are not soluble in 
water, like for degradation of PAHs (Majcher czyk et al. 1998). In the literature, several 
studies on stability in organic solvents are found. The laccase of the white-rot fungus 
P. pulmonarius  for example showed low stability with ACN and EtOH, as only 70% and 64% 
of the activity remained after incubation in 10% final concentration of the organic solvent, 
respectively (De Souza and Peralta 2003). C. unicolor  laccase tested in 50% methanol, 50% 
ACN and 50% dioxane revealed a half life time of 4 h, 2.8 h and <30 min, respectively. In the respective study, dioxan already showed an inhibition of 70% after 30 min of incubation (Gianfreda et al. 1998). For
 Polyporus pinsitus  laccase, residual activity was 45%, 75% and 
75% subsequently to mixing the enzymes with (1:1 v/v) EtOH, ACN and dioxane, respectively (d'Acunzo et al. 2004). Compared to these enzymes, Lcc5 showed a very good stability with a half life of 4 h (45% ACN final concentration) and 2 h for ACN concentrations 
of 45% and 90%. In ethanol of concentrations of up to 45%, Lcc5 showed almost the same activity after 24 h as the control (incubation in water). Only in 90% EtOH a more rapid inhibition was observed, but the enzyme still reached a half life of 4 h. This makes Lcc5 a good candidate for reactions, where organic solvents are needed (Mikolasch and Schauer 2009). To a lesser degree, this can also be deduced for laccase Lcc1 that had also a quite 
good stability in the organic solvents in cont rast to enzymes Lcc6 and Lcc7 (Table 7). 
 
D. Enzymatic kinetics with different substrates  
The Michaelis-Menten-kinetics revealed differences between the laccases towards the 
different substrates tested. Lcc1 and Lcc5 showed K m values of 656 µM and 831 µM, 
respectively, which are in the range of fungal laccases (Baldrian 2006, Kilaru 2006). In 
contrast,  the laccases Lcc6 and Lcc7 had higher K m values of 2683 µM and 3999 µM, 
respectively, which are more in the uppe r range and similar to values found for P. ostreatus  
laccases (Kilaru 2006). The phenolic based substrates used in this study (DMP, guaiacol and SGZ) differ in their redox potentials depending on the substituents at the phenolic ring (Lind 
et al. 1990). In these substrates, the methoxy groups at the phenolic ring reduce the redox potential of the substrate from 0.79 V (vs. NHE) for phenol to 0.54 V for the mono-4-
methoxyphenol and 0.42 V for th e dimethoxy-phenol DMP (Lind et  al. 1990, Jovanovic et al. 
1991). With lower redox potentials  of tested substrates, the catalytical efficiency of laccases 
increases as shown here for all tested laccases with guaiacol, DMP to SGZ in increasing order 
of efficiencies. The best substrate SGZ posses two phenolic rings both substituted with two methoxy groups and seems to have the lowest redox potential for all substrates tested in Chapter 5 
 250 this study. The dependence of the enzymatic reaction activity on the redox potential of the 
substrates guaiacol, DMP and SGZ was already observed for Trametes pubescens  laccase 
(Galhaup et al. 2002), Trametes sp. LacE (Tong et al. 2007) and Trametes  sp. strain AH28-2 
laccase (Xiao et al. 2003).   The affinity of the laccases towards the phenolic substrates described by the K
m value was in 
the range for characterised laccases from other fungi (Kilaru 2006), except for Lcc6 and Lcc7, which showed high K
m values for DMP (1.5 mM and 1.1 mM, respectively). Only 
A. nidulans  laccases showed higher K m values for DMP with 1.3 mM for laccase II (Scherer 
and Fischer 1998) and 3.9 mM fo r laccase I (Clutterbuck 1972). A. niger  laccases I did 
however not oxidise the standard substrates SGZ and ABTS (Scherer and Fischer 1998). It is thus biochemically unclear, in which relation the 
A. niger  enzyme stands. Phylogenetic 
studies of protein sequences suggested that the ascomycete enzymes are different evolutionary developments away from the laccases being typical basidiomycetes’ enzymes (Hoegger et al. 2006). The 
A. nidulans  enzymes group with other ascomycete enzymes 
known to act in pigment synthesis (Hoegger et al. 2006).  For a more general characterisation of laccase re activity, the redox potential of the T1 site of 
the enzyme of interest can de determined. Because this value depends also on the Michealis-Menten kinetics (shown by Xu et al. 1996), it is a more general value for comparison of the 
oxidation potential of different laccase. In this  study, the redox potential of Lcc5 at pH 6.4 
had an average value of 542 mV ± 20 mV. This is in the same range as observed for the 
C. cinerea  laccase Lcc1 recombinantly produced in A. oryzae , for which in two parallel 
studies of the same group a redox potential of 540 mV ± 50 mV and 550 mV ± 80 mV was measured using either I
2-NaI and K 3Fe(CN) 6-K4Fe(CN) 6 as a redox-couple for redox-titration 
of the laccase (Yaver et al. 1999, Schneider et al. 1999). Besides the effect of different 
redox-couples, the pH might also influence th e redox potential, e.g.  Garzillo et al. (2001) 
tested native laccases of three different fungi ( P. ostreatus , Rigidoporus lignosus  and 
Trametes trogii ) and showed that with an increase in pH (pH 5.0 to 7.0) the E° value of the 
laccases decreased between 10 mV and 50 mV.  Nevertheless, also structural features of the enzyme might have an impact on the redox potential, as different activities of one enzyme towards substrates with similar redox 
potential were observed (Xu et al. 1996, Garzillo et al. 1998 and 2001). Characterised 
Trametes  laccases have, generally, high redox potent ials (Klonowska et al. 2002, Saparrat et 
al. 2002, Shleev et al. 2005), e.g. redox potential of the Trametes pubescence laccases LAC1 Purification and characterisation of three new laccases from the basidiomycete C. cinerea  
 
 251and LAC2 were 746 and 738 mV, respectively  (Shleev et al. 2007). On the other hand, 
laccases from P. ostreatus , Rigidoporus lignosus  and Trametes trogii  tested by Garzillo et al. 
(2001) differed little in their Cu binding site feature, the E° values were quite different 
(150 mV). The difference between the redox potential of the substrate and the laccase, due 
to the electron transfer between the molecules, is one criterion for the activity. However, the quality of the oxidation of the substrate via a laccase depends also on how good the laccase 
accept the electron from the substrate and this reaction takes place at the T1 site.   In laccases, T1 copper is positioned by two histidines and one cysteine. The histidines may also act for electron transfer from the substrate towards the copper (Bertrand et al. 2002). In the nearer region of the T1 site (10 amino acid downstream of the cysteine ligand), either a leucine or phenylalanine is mostly located in fungal laccases (Xu et al. 1996). In contrast, in ascorbate oxidases, the T1 site has a methionine at this position, as has the laccase of 
A. nidulans  (Aramayo and Timberlake 1990). This am ino acid difference was speculated to 
be responsible for the higher redox potential of the T1 copper in laccases compared to the ascorbate oxidases (Reinhammar and Malmstrom 1 981, Thurston 1994). Eggert et al. (1998) 
classified the laccases into three classes (1, 2 and 3) for residues methionine, leucine and phenylalanine, respectively . According to this, all 
C. cinerea  laccases, predicted from the in 
total 17 genes in the genome of the fungus (Kilaru et al. 2006), except the product of gene 
lcc12 are class 2 enzymes as are the genes coding for laccases of P. ostreatus  pox1 and 
pox2, A. bisporus  lcc1 and lcc2, as well as the laccases of Rigidoporus lignosus , 
Melanocarpus albomyces and others (Eggert et al. 1998, Zhukhlistova et al. 2008). In the 
system of Eggert et al. (1998) Lcc12 would be ca tegorised in class 3 and, therefore, as high 
E0 laccase. Thus, it would be very interesting to study the redox potential of Lcc12. 
Unfortunately, expression studies with a construct containing the C. cinerea  laccase gene 
lcc12 under control of the A. bisporus gpdII  promoter in C. cinerea  FA2222 failed to give a 
positive transformant (Kilaru 2006).  Contradictory to the proposal made by Eggert et al. (1998), 
Neurospora crassa  laccase with 
leucine in this axial position has already a hi gh redox potential of 780 mV (Piontek et al. 
2002). Also point mutations in laccases of Myceliophthora thermophila  L513F and 
Rhizoctonia solani  L470F in this position did not support this idea, as the redox potential did 
not alter significantly (Xu et al. 1998). Thus, the differences in the E° values might also be 
due to conformational changes more far away from the T1-Cu centre. Comparison of 
C. cinerea  Lcc1 (550 mV) with P. ostreatus POXC (740 mV), whose redox potential values 
have a 190 mV difference, shows no differences in the 5 Å region near the T1-Cu centre. Chapter 5 
 252 This supports the possibility that conformational  changes more far away  from the Cu centre 
can have an influence on the redo x potential of the enzyme (Garzillo et al. 2001). Piontek et 
al. (2002) proposed a hydrogen bond between a glutamine (Glu460 in T. versicolor  laccase) 
and serine residue (Ser113 in T. versicolor  laccase) having an indirect effect on the binding 
distance between the histidine ligand, two amino acid upstream of the glutamine, and the T1 
copper. It was also proposed that the redox potential depends on the amino acids building 
the substrate pocket, as all laccases with high redox potential have conserved amino acid sequences in the T1 and substrate pock et side (Zhukhlistova et al. 2008).  
 Overall, the laccases might be clustered according to their Michaelis-Menten parameters for two substrates ABTS and DMP into two distinct groups: Lcc1 and Lcc5 show low K
m values 
with ABTS and DMP, whereas Lcc6 and Lcc7 very high ones. In contrast, for guaiacol, only Lcc1 showed good kinetic parameters. The re ason for this discrepancy is still unknown. 
Regarding differences of amino acid sequences (see Fig. 11) concerning the redox potential a concluding remark towards the 
C. cinerea  l a c c a s e s  i s  h a r d  t o  g i v e ,  s i n c e  w e  o n l y  h a v e  
measured the redox potential of Lcc5. Ongoing experiments for the determination of the 
redox potential of the missing C. cinerea  laccases might help to understand differences in the 
redox potential coming from di fferent amino acid sequences. 
 
E. Conclusions 
In this study, four different C. cinerea laccases were biochemically analysed. Different properties made them candidates for different biotechnological applications. Generally, by a 
high overall stability and good enzymatic kineti cs for the tested substrates laccase Lcc5 
would be in many instances a first choice for a pplication. In addition, this enzyme is easily 
produced in high quantities (Table 3). Also lacc ase Lcc1 by its high st ability against inhibitors 
and production rates is a promising candidate for usage in biotechnologic al applications. Lcc6 
and Lcc7 are less favourable but further compar ative biochemical characterisation may give 
interesting details to better understand how laccases work and how possibly manipulate amino acid sequences to optimise enzymes fo r specific biotechnological utilisations.

6 Final discussion and prospects 
 
Laccases are enzymes capable of performing various oxidation reactions on different 
phenolic and aromatic substrates. They mostly  occur in the fungal kingdom and are most 
frequently found and studied in the white- rot fungi and other saprotrophic mostly 
basidiomycete fungi, which secrete high amounts of these enzymes. By their specific enzymatic properties particularly the enzyme s from basidiomycetes are of interest for 
industrial purposes. According to the varyin g characteristics of laccases (Baldrian 2006, 
Kilaru 2006), there exists a broad range of different applications laccases can and have been used for. The utilisation approaches include degradation of toxic aromatic and phenolic 
compounds, decolourisation of dyes or production of wood composites (section 1.II). Nevertheless, only some of these possible applications have found their way into industrial usage. 
Commercially, laccases are usually produced with fungi in submerged fermentation (SmF), 
where they can grow in a filamentous or pelleted like form (chapter 3). One bottleneck for the use of laccases in industry is the low yield of laccase secretion in natural producing fungal organisms. Although studies were pub lished in which native laccase amounts are in 
the mg range, as for example in liquid cultures of 
Trametes hirsuta  (Koroleva et al. 2002), 
yields are normally still too low for bulk usag e, such as bioremediation and wood composite 
production. Additionally, the relative slow gr owth of basidiomycetes in liquid cultures 
increases fermentation costs for the native laccase production. Thus, for commercial laccases ascomycetes are used as a host for recombinant production in the industry such as for the 
laccase solution Novozyme
® 51003 where an Aspergillus  species is used as a host for an 
enzyme originating from Trametes  sp. (Novozymes A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). However, 
also native produced laccases can be found on the market such as from Agaricus bisprous  
(ASA Spezialenzyme GmbH, Wolfenbüttel, German y). Nevertheless of the possibility to use 
ascomycetous hosts for enzyme production, yields for foreign laccases produced heterologously in filamentous ascomycetes and yeasts as known from many published 
scientific studies are usually still low (section 2.I). As stat ed in the literature, several 
attempts have been conducted to improve laccas e yields and reduce production costs. One 
possibility is the cultivation of the filamentous fungi in solid state fermentation (SSF) with 
cheap lignocellulosic waste materials as a carrier and substrate (section 2.I).   Chapter 6 
 260 I. Solid state fermentation (SSF) ver sus submerged fermentation 
(SmF) for production of laccases  
In this study, industrial SSF cultures of Pleurotus ostreatus  on wheat straw for mushroom 
production resulted in laccase and VP (versatile peroxidases) activities of up to 7 U/gds 
(units per gram dry substrate; comparable to 2 U/ml) and MnP activities of up to 50 U/gds 
(comparable to 14 U/ml), respectively (secti on 2.II; Rühl et al. 2008). In a more small 
l a b o r a t o r y  s c a l e ,  M e z a  e t  a l .  ( 2 0 0 7 )  o b t a i n e d  i n  S S F  c u l t u r e s  o f  Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  
strain ss3 on sugarcane bagasse an activity of 10 U/gds which was increased to 71 U/gds by addition of ethanol. For 
Ganoderma  sp., a much higher laccase activity was achieved with up 
to 2400 U/gds when cultivated on wheat bran. Th is yield was further in creased by additional 
carbon and nitrogen sources to values of 10050 U/gds (Revankar et al. 2007). Thus, different studies show that high laccase yields  can be obtained with SSF. Neverthe less, also 
in SmF cultures high yields of laccases are achieved (sections 2.I,  3.I, Couto and Toca-
Herrera 2007). Whether SSF or SmF is the favourable technique cannot be decided in general, but varies from fungus to fungus and has to be tested as the cases arise. To gain 
broader knowledge on this issue, several expe riments were conducted on both cultivation 
types with the same organism.  Different studies compare the growth and enzymatic yields of various filamentous fungi 
either of ascomycetous or basidiomycetous or igin in SSF and SmF cultures, respectively 
(reviewed by Hölker et al. 2004). Some studies compare the laccase production in both 
culture techniques conducted with the same stra in (Baldrian and Gabriel 2002, Fenice et al. 
2003). For example in a study by Téllez-Téllez et al. (2008), 
P. ostreatus  biomass and 
laccase yields were higher in SmF (13.0 AU/ml or 2320 AU/g dry biomass; AU = arbitrary units) compared to SSF (2.4 AU/ml or 540 AU/g dry biomass), which might be due to the high protease activity measured in SSF but lacking in SmF. Nevertheless, 
P. ostreatus  had a 
50% higher µ max (maximal growth rate) in SSF compared to SmF (Téllez-Téllez et al. 2008). 
Also in other studies, a higher laccase yield was achieved for P. ostreatus  in SmF compared 
to SSF (Ardon et al. 1998, Baldrian and Gabriel 2002). In contrast, for Lentinula edodes , 
Panus tigrinus  and P. ostreatus  higher activities were obtained in SSF cultures as compared 
to SmF (Fenice et al. 2003, Elisashvili et al. 2008, Mazumder et al. 2009).  These data show that production yields of laccases do not only vary between both cultivation techniques (SSF and SmF), but are also influenced e.g. by the substrate used in the SSF, as shown for 
P. ostreatus  cultivated on different lignocellulo sic waste materials (Elisashvili et al. 
2008). Final discussion and prospects 
 261Further, general studies to reveal differences between SSF and SmF were conducted for the 
industrial important filamentous fungi Aspergillus niger  and Aspergillus oryzae , where the 
authors studied expression of growth related genes in SSF and SmF (te Biesebeke et al. 
2002, 2005a and 2005b, Viniegra-González et al. 2003, Oda et al. 2006). To my knowledge, 
such analysis are yet missing for basidiomycetes, but approaches exists to gain an insight into differences between secretomes of 
P. ostreatus and Phanerochaete chrysosporium  
cultivated in SmF and SSF (Bernauer et al. 2009, Fragner et al., unpublished).   Primarily, when using bagasse, straw or other lignocellulosic waste materials, SSF may have an economically advantage over SmF (section 2.I). Nevertheless, one bottleneck when using 
lignocellulosic materials is the purification of the extracellular enzymes, as degradation products (e.g. phenolic compounds) or wash outs from the carrier can hamper the down-stream processing (section 2.II, Rühl et al. 2008). To circumvent this problem, inert carriers can be used, such as a steel mesh or polyurethan foam. When we cultivated 
C. cinerea  in an 
immersion SSF-system (described in section 2.I and Böhmer et al. 2006) for production of laccases, the fungus grew well on the inert carriers perlite and coal. Unfortunately, due to mycelium which was also present in the liquid medium used for the immersion of the carrier, we could not differentiate between laccase activity coming from the mycelium which 
colonised the carriers or which was present in the liquid medium (data not shown). Future 
experiments with an improved technical set-up to hinder mycelium reaching the liquid phase 
of the immersion SSF reactor (RITA
®) might help to test the growth and laccase production 
of C. cinerea . Also different laccase isoenzymes and/or isoforms might be expressed in SSF 
cultures of C. cinerea  compared to the already studied SmF cultures (section 4.I), as it was 
done for native laccase production with P. ostreatus  (Téllez-Téllez et al. 2008). 
Currently, in studies of SSF the focus to im prove production yields lies mostly on the 
bioreactor design or process type and not on the fungal organism (Punt et al. 2002). However, future studies should  focus on the organism itself to improve our knowledge for 
usage of filamentou s fungi in SSF.  
    Chapter 6 
 262 II. Improvement of recombinant laccase production in  
Coprinopsis cinerea 
Generally, wildtype strains of filamentous basidiomycetes we re used for production of 
laccases and other ligninolytic en zymes in scientific studies (sec tion 2.I). Nevertheless, also 
recombinant production of these enzymes in filamentous basidiomycetes exists. There are 
transformation protocols available for some white-rot fungi such as for P. ostreatus  (Irie et 
al. 2001a and 2001b), which was successfully  transformed, expressing a homologous 
manganese peroxidases gene ( mnp2 ) under control of the homologous sdi1-promoter 
(Tsukihara et al. 2006). Also laccase ge nes were successfully  transformed into 
basidiomycetes, such as into the white rot fungi Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  and Trametes 
versicolor  and into the saprotrophic species Coprinopsis cinerea  where laccase genes were 
expressed homologously under co ntrol of an own or a foreig n glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase gene ( gpd) promoter. Highest yields of 280 U/ml, 1 U/ml and 3 U/ml were 
reached with transformants of these fungi in liqui d cultures, respectively  (Alves et al. 2004, 
Kajita et al. 2004, Kilaru et al. 2006).   Recombinant laccase production in 
C. cinerea  and its optimisation has been started in the 
Göttingen laboratory for Molecular Wood Biotechnology and Tec hnical Mycology by Sreedhar 
Kilaru (Kilaru 2006). In his work, five promoter s, three of them in different fragment length, 
were tested for their efficiency to homologously express the C. cinerea  laccase gene lcc1. 
The best promoter was found to be the  gpdII -promoter of the basidiomycete A. bisporus  
(Kilaru et al. 2006). The clone giving highest laccase yields was used throughout this study for optimisation of laccase activity in the supernatant of shake flask and stirred bioreactor cultures. By changing the media and decreasing the temperature for growth, we could increase the total laccase activity in shake flask cultures up to 3fold (section 3.III). However, 
the increase in total laccase activity at 25 °C does not result solely from the recombinantly 
produced enzyme, but to a somewhat small extend from native laccases produced by the fungus at the lower cultivation temperature (section 4.I). Nevertheless, when using a 
different 
C. cinerea  strain for homologo us expression of lcc1 a 3.5 fold increase in 
recombinant laccase activity could be achieved  at the standard cultivation temperature of 
37 °C (section 4.II).   In the future, several approaches might be co nducted to further increase laccase yields by 
recombinant production in 
C. cinerea  (e.g. further improving cultivation conditions, Final discussion and prospects 
 263optimisation of the production host by selectin g better strains for secr etion) and to improve 
laccase properties (e.g. site-directed mutation, randomised mutagenesis).  
 
A. Optimisation of laccase production 
The secretion of proteins produced by filamentous fungi occurs most probably at the hyphal tip or the apical region (Wösten et al. 1991,  Moukha et al. 1993, Gordon et al. 2000, and 
reviewed by Conesa et al. 2001). Thus, strain s possessing multiple hyphal tips, known as 
hyperbranching mutants, might positively influe nce the productivity of filamentous fungi in 
terms of protein secretion (Bocking et al. 1999, Meyer et al. 2008).   Not only the amount of hyphal tips might play a role, but also the age of the producing hyphae, as it was shown in experiments with 
P. chrysosporium . At the central core area of 
agar plate colonies of P. chrysoporium  small hyphae, so called secondary hyphae, showed 
high production of LiP and MnP (Moukha et al. 1993). In liquid cultures, where  
P. chrysosporium  grows in form of mycelial pellets, Mn P production occurs mostly at the 
outer layer of the pellets in the apical part of the hyphae and in chlamydospore like cells present in the subapical region of hyphae in the outer and middle zone of the pellets (Jiménez-Tobon et al. 2003). For the 
C. cinerea  lcc1 t r a n s f o r m a n t  u se d  i n  t h i s  s t u d y ,  w e  
tried to reveal production zones of laccase in the fungal pellets derived from liquid cultures by staining with a laccase substrate. Likely due to the omnipresence of the enzyme throughout the pellet and the cultivation media,  no clear differentiation between outer and 
inner part of the pellet could be de termined (data not shown). Whether 
in situ  localisation by 
immunolabelling with antibodies in cross sections of C. cinerea  pellets might reveal 
production zones of laccases as it was done for MnP in P. chrysosporium  pellet (Jiménez-
Tobon et al. 2003) has to be tested. It was already shown that polyclonal antibodies are 
capable to detect the recombinantly produced Lcc1 (Kellner et al. 2007). Also further studies with a 
gfp-expressing transformant (section 3.II) might reveal a better insight into the 
production pattern of C. cinerea pellets and regions of acti ve hyphae. Fig. 1 shows a 
promising collage of single photos made from a gfp-expressing pellet of a C. cinerea  FA2222 
transformant.

section 3.II) and p hotographed in single sectors by  a CCD camera attached to a microscope (Axioplan 2, Carl 
Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Göttingen). 
 
Several other factors are of interest to enhance protein secretion, such as improvement of the signal sequence of the laccases, and correc t glycosylation and folding by the host in case 
of recombinant protein production (Conesa et al. 2001, Iwashita 2002). For example, O-linked glycosylation is generally important for secretion and N-linked glycosylation for the stability of secreted proteins (Peberdy 1994, Deshpande et al. 2008). Another factor 
influencing the stability of the secreted prot eins are proteases, which might degrade the 
extracellular enzymes and, thus, abolish an improvement in the secretion amount of an 
enzyme of interest. Therefore, protease-deficient mutants are of high interest for recombinant production of en zymes in filamentous organisms, such as for example the 
Aspergillus  species (Punt et al. 2002, Schmidt 2004). Low or no protease activity might be 
achieved by applying certain cultivation techni ques or genetical modification of the used 
strain. For example, Xu et al. (2000) described a decrease of protease activity, concomitant with a shift from free mycelium to a pellet growth form, in 
A. niger  liquid cultures. 
 Although 
C. cinerea strains seem to secrete a high amount  of different proteases (Lilly et al. 
2008, Fragner et al. unpublished) with increasing  proteolytic activity in  liquid cultures over 
the time, they seemingly do not degrade homologue proteins, such as the laccase Lcc1 (section 4.II). For heterologous expression  this might be different, as shown for 
A. niger (Xu 
e t  a l .  2 0 0 0 ) .  N e v e r t h e l e s s ,  t h i s  h a s  t o  b e  c l a r i f i e d  f o r  C. cinerea , where studies are in 
progress for heterologous expression of lacca se genes (Grimrath 2007, Spezzia-Mazzocco 
unpublished). Various T. versicolor  laccase genes under control of the A. bisporus gpdII -
promoter were introduced into C. cinerea  Fa2222, but none of the transformants rise to 
laccase production. Further studies need to cl arify whether this is due to missing protein 
production or to fast degradation of produced protein.  
Final discussion and prospects 
 265Different other methods were already tested to improve laccase yields in production 
processes with filamentous fungi. One of these improvements concerned a better copper transport, as it was shown for 
T. versicolor , where an eightfold increase was obtained when 
overexpressing a copper-transporting ATPase ( ctaA) and a copper chaperone protein ( tahA) 
(Uldschmid et al. 2002 and 2003).   
B. Changing biochemical properties of C.  cinerea  laccases 
Laccases of C. cinerea  secreted naturally into liquid media vary in their composition and 
amounts (section 4.I), as well as in their properties (chapter 5). Laccases Lcc1 and Lcc5 which are produced natively in higher amount s compared to the other extracellular laccases 
of the fungus showed better biochemical properties for most tested substrates than laccases Lcc6 and Lcc7, so far not found naturally expr essed by monokaryotic strains cultivated in 
liquid cultures (compare section 4.I and chapter 5). Lcc1 showed best biochemical properties with three of the four substrates  and highest stability in presence  of the tested inhibitors in 
comparison to all other tested  laccases. Lcc5 was the most stable enzyme in the organic 
solvents ethanol and acetonitrile  (ACN). Nevertheless, also both of the probably not natively 
produced laccases Lcc6 and Lcc7 showed best properties for some of the tested characteristics: Lcc6 had a high thermal stability and Lcc7 better kine tic properties with the 
laccase substrate syringaldazine (SGZ) than all other laccases.  
 Unfortunately up to know, it was only possible to determine the redox potential for the purified laccases Lcc5. The value for Lcc5 of around 540 mV (chapter 5) is similar to the redox potential of the already heterologously produced Lcc1 of 
C. cinerea  (540-550 mV; 
Yaver et al. 1999, Schneider et al. 1999). Whether the laccases Lcc6 and Lcc7 are also in this range has to be clarified in the future. Worth mentioning is that Lcc5 was the most stable 
laccase tested in the organic solvents ACN an d ethanol with remaining 50% of its activity 
after incubation for 24 h either in 18% ACN or 45% ethanol (chapter 5).   Both laccase properties, stability in organic so lvents and redox potential, are in focus of 
optimisation studies to improve the quality of  laccases (Hu et al. 2007, Zumárraga et al. 
2008, Festa et al. 2008). Randomised mutage nesis might give rise  to new laccases with 
interesting properties. For example Zumárraga et  al. (2007) could improve the stability of the 
temperature tolerant laccase from 
Myceliophthora thermophila  in the organic solvents ACN 
and ethanol by applying error-prone PCR and site-directed mutagenesis. By in vitro randomised mutagenesis of a plasmid containing a 
Fome lignosus  laccase gene, Hu et al. Chapter 6 
 266 (2007) obtained a mutant laccase which showed a change in two amino acid residues that 
resulted in a more hydrophilic water channel of the laccase and, thus, in the higher 
catalytical efficiency determined for the mutant laccase.  
 
This shows that randomised mutagenesis (e .g. by chemical compounds) followed by 
adequate screening methods, such as for high er stability in organic solvents, can lead to 
improved laccase activities. Additionally, also site-directed mutations to replace amino acids 
were applied e.g. to enhance th e redox potential of the T1 site (Xu et al. 1998, Durão et al. 
2008), to study the trinuclear copper cluster (Ueki et al. 2006) or to increase stability of the enzyme (Bornscheuer et al. 2002). Whether randomised mutagenesis or site directed mutation is the best choice to change the laccase characteristics has to be decided for each individual case.   
III. General conclusions 
Further studies to reveal charac teristics of growth and protein secretion in SmF and SSF are 
of highly interest for comparison  of both cultivation systems. C. cinerea  and P. ostreatus  are 
adequate organisms for such studies since they can be cultivated in bo th systems (chapter 2 
and 3), their genomes are available ( C. cinerea  at http://www.broad.mit.edu and 
P. ostreatus  at http://www.jgi.doe.gov) and molecula r techniques for genetic modifications 
exist (Granado et al. 1997, Irie et al. 2001a and 2001b). Additionally, they possess a ligninolytic system, which makes them capable to grow on lignocellulosic waste materials. 
Especially in the case of 
P. ostreatus , where standard cultivation techniques for SSF in the 
industrial range are available, transformation of genes coding for interesting fungal enzymes would be of interest for the biotec hnological industry (chapter 2).  
For an example, laccase is a good candidate for further studies, since both of the organisms are able to secrete relatively high amounts of this enzyme, which was enhanced in the case 
of 
C. cinerea  by using specific strains and recombinant production (chapter 4). With the 
characterisation of four laccases coming from  the same organism we showed differences in 
the functionality an d stability of the C. cinerea  laccases (chapter 5) . Ongoing studies to 
produce and characterise the remaining C. cinerea  laccases will give a closer look into 
relations between laccase gene sequences and th eir biochemical characteristics. With this 
knowledge, enhamcement of the laccase using site directed mutation should be possible.   Final discussion and prospects
