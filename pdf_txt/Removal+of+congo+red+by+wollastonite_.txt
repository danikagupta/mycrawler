Abstract
A literature review of the use of sorbents and biosorbents to treat polluted aqueous efÔ¨Çuents containing dyes :organics or metal
ions has been conducted. Over 70 systems have been reported since 1984 and over 43 of these reported the mechanism as beinga pseudo-Ô¨Årst order kinetic mechanism. Three sorption kinetic models are presented in this paper and have been used to test 11of the literature systems previously reported as Ô¨Årst order kinetics and one system previously reported as a second order process.In all 12 systems, the highest correlation coefÔ¨Åcients were obtained for the pseudo-second order kinetic model. ¬© 1999 ElsevierScience Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction
The sorption of pollutants from aqueous solution
plays an important role in wastewater treatment since iteliminates the need for huge sludge-handling processes.Well-designed sorption processes have high efÔ¨Åciencyresulting in a high-quality efÔ¨Çuent after treatmentwhich can be recycled. Furthermore, if low-cost sor-bents or sorbent regeneration is feasible then the sor-bent material cost can be kept low. It is thereforeunderstandable that the study of sorption kinetics inwastewater treatment is signiÔ¨Åcant as it provides valu-able insights into the reaction pathways and into themechanism of sorption reactions. In addition, the kinet-ics describe the solute uptake rate which in turn con-trols the residence time of sorbate uptake at thesolid‚Äìsolution interface. Therefore, it is important tobe able to predict the rate at which pollutant is re-moved from aqueous solutions in order to design ap-propriate sorption treatment plants. To developsorption kinetics, a knowledge of the rate law describ-ing the sorption system is required. The rate law isdetermined by experimentation and it cannot be in-ferred by more examination of the overall chemicalreaction equation. The rate law has three primary re-
quirements [1]:
¬ìA knowledge of all the molecular details of thereaction including the energetics and stereo-chemistry.
¬ìInteratomic distances and angles throughout thecourse of the reaction.
¬ìThe individual molecular steps involved in themechanism.
1.1.Simple sorption kinetic systems
Numerous sorption systems have been investigated
particularly during the past 15 years. Most of thesehave been reported as Ô¨Årst order kinetic processes.Bhattacharya and Venkobachar [2] presented a simpleÔ¨Årst order reversible kinetic model, based on solutionconcentration for the sorption of cadmium(II) fromliquid phase onto both Giridih coal and crushed co-conut shell, as a reversible reaction with an equilibriumbeing established between two liquid and solid phases.This model has been applied to several other sorptionsystems (Table 1).
The pseudo-Ô¨Årst order rate equation of Lagergren [3]
has long been widely applied. In 1947, Boyd et al. [4]developed a rate equation which considered rates ofion-exchange adsorption in the exchange adsorption of

ions from aqueous solutions by organic zeolites. In
the cases of diffusion through a boundary liquid Ô¨Ålmand adsorption kinetics as a chemical phenomenon,the authors concluded that a mass action rate equa-tion for adsorption kinetics as a chemical phe-nomenon and a diffusion equation for diffusionthrough a boundary liquid Ô¨Ålm are the same as thepseudo-Ô¨Årst order rate equation of Lagergren. Theyalso concluded that if Ô¨Ålm diffusion is rate con-trolling, the constant of the equation will vary in-versely with the particle size and the Ô¨Ålm thickness; ifthe exchange is chemically rate controlled, the con-stant of the equation will be independent of particlediameter and Ô¨Çow rate and will depend only on theconcentrations of the ions in solution and the temper-ature. The earlier application of the pseudo-Ô¨Årst orderrate equation of Lagergren to the sorption of cellu-lose triacetate from chloroform on calcium silicatewas undertaken by Trivedi et al. [5]. Numerous stud-ies report pseudo-Ô¨Årst order Lagergren kinetics forthe sorption of metals, such as the sorption of arsen-ite(III) from aqueous solutions by haematite [6] andthe sorption of nickel(II) from aqueous solutions bywollastonite and china clay [7,8]. Several other metalsorption examples are listed in Table 1. The sameÔ¨Årst pseudo-order model was used for the sorption ofdyes, such as the sorption of Omega Chrome RedME (OCRME) using a 1:1 ratio of Ô¨Çy ash and coal[9], and the sorption of Methylene Blue on waterhyacinth roots [10]. Table 1 shows a number of otherpseudo-Ô¨Årst order dye sorption systems.
In addition, Seki and Suzuki [11] reported that the
kinetics of lead(II) sorption on a composite biopoly-mer sorbent of alginic acid and humic acid can beapproximated to a pseudo-Ô¨Årst order reaction withthe Lagergren expression based on metal complexa-tion.
Research work has been conducted using pseudo-
second order kinetics for sorption reactions; for in-stance, Gosset et al. [12] reported batch metalremoval by peat. Sharma and Forster [13‚Äì15] re-ported that the kinetics of the sorption of chromi-um(VI) using peat, leaf mould and granular activatedcarbon follow a pseudo-second order reaction rate.Ho et al. [16‚Äì18] reported that sorption of copper(II)and nickel(II) using peat in single- and bi-solute sys-tems follows a similar second order reaction mecha-nism. Other examples for metal ions and dyes aregiven in Table 1.
Moreale and Van Bladel [19] developed an empiri-
cal model for the sorption of p-chloroaniline using
Soignies and Heverlee I soils. The order of the reac-tion was calculated to be 1.92 and 1.93 for Soigniesand Heverlee I soils respectively. Dzombak andMorel [20] found that the kinetics of cadmium(II)sorption on hydrous ferric oxide can be described bya second order rate equation and the kinetics of sorp-
tion should correspond to a reversible second orderreaction at low sorbate :sorbent ratios (Ô¨Årst order at
very low ratios), and two competitive reversible sec-ond order reactions at higher sorbate :sorbent ratios.
1.2.Complex sorption kinetic systems
Singh et al. [21] reported that the sorption of mer-
cury(II) by kaolinite obeyed multiple Ô¨Årst order kinet-ics. Varshney et al. [22] proposed that the kinetics ofsorption of the pesticide phosphamidon on beads ofantimony(V) phosphate cation exchanger followedsecond order kinetics during the Ô¨Årst 15 min, but af-terwards, up to 180 min, it is a Ô¨Årst order reaction.Sarkar and Chattoraj [23] have shown that the sorp-tion of proteins such as lysozyme, b-lactoglobulin
and hemoglobin from aqueous solution to the surfaceof silica powder follow Ô¨Årst order Lagergren kineticswith two kinetic constants. Atun and Sismanoglu [24]found that the sorption of 4,4 %-isopropylidene diphe-
nol (Bis-phenol A) and diphenylolpropane-4,4 %-diosy-
acetic acid (Bis acid A2) on kaolinite-type clayfollows a Ô¨Årst order process. However, at low concen-trations of Bis-phenol A the mechanism follows aÔ¨Årst order rate expression with two kinetic steps.Comber et al. [25] reported a complex multi-step pro-cesses, with equilibration times varying from minutesto weeks, for the sorption of cadmium(II), copper(II)and zinc(II) onto natural suspended particulate matterin the Humber estuary. It is often incorrect to applysimple kinetic models such as Ô¨Årst- or second-orderrate equations to a sorption with solid surfaces whichare rarely homogeneous and because the effects oftransport phenomena and chemical reactions are oftenexperimentally inseparable [26].
Salim et al. [27] reported that the sorption of cad-
mium(II) on beech leaves is a Ô¨Årst order reactionbased on the solution concentration with respect tocadmium(II). Salim et al. [28] reported that the inter-action between lead(II) and cypress leaves followed afractional order of 0.7 based on the solution concen-tration with respect to lead(II). In the case of columnstudies the kinetics of copper(II) and lead(II) sorptiononto polysulfone and algae complex follow the Ô¨Årstorder rate law based on the sorption capacity of thesolid [29], and the kinetics of isoproturon sorptiononto soil follow a reversible Ô¨Årst order process hence-forward described as the distance-from-equilibriumrate law [30]. Locke et al. [31] reported that the ki-netics of aciÔ¨Çuorfen sorption onto soil follow a Ô¨Årstorder process. Chien and Clayton [32] reported thatthe Elovich equation may be used to describe thekinetics of phosphate sorption in soils. Taylor et al.[33] reported that zinc sorption kinetics by 12 Ala-bama soils was best described by the Elovich equa-Y.S.Ho,G.McKay :Process Biochemistry 34 (1999) 451‚Äì465 453

tion when six models were tested, namely, zero-, Ô¨Årst-,
second-, third-order, parabolic diffusion and Elovich.These data are summarized in Table 1.
In the present work, a correlative kinetic analysis
approach to the sorption process has been adopted andvarious sorption parameters such as the equilibriumsorption capacity, percent metal ion removal, rate con-stants and initial sorption rate, can be calculated fromthe experimental data by the pseudo-second order ratelow. A pseudo-second order kinetic model is presentedand discussed. Furthermore, data from the literaturehave been analysed and a comparison of the best Ô¨Åtsorption mechanisms has been made with the mecha-
nisms proposed in the literature.

The experimental data discussed and analysed by the
pseudo-second order kinetic mechanism, proposed inthis paper, have been reported previously in the litera-ture. The experimental data analysed are the sorptionof Victoria Blue dye onto Ô¨Çy ash by Khare et al.

3. Theoretical models
Several models can be used to express the mechanism
of solute sorption onto a sorbent. In order to investi-gate the mechanism of sorption, characteristic constantsof sorption were determined using a pseudo-Ô¨Årst orderequation of Lagergren [3] based on solid capacity, aÔ¨Årst order equation of Bhattacharya and Venkobachar[2] based on solution concentration, and a pseudo-sec-ond order equation based on solid phase sorptionrespectively.

4. Results and discussion
Table 1 shows the mechanism of sorption for various
systems reported in the literature since 1984.
Fig. 1 shows a plot of the linearized form of the
pseudo-Ô¨Årst order model in Eq. (2) for the sorption ofcopper(II) onto peat at various initial copper(II) con-centrations for the initial 20 min. However, the experi-mental data deviate considerably from the theoreticaldata after this short period. The rate of sorption wasassumed to be proportional to the difference betweenthe maximum capacity, q
c, at equilibrium and the ca-
pacity at any time, t, of the sorbed in a Ô¨Årst order at the
initial reaction stage. Fig. 2 shows a plot of the lin-earized form of the Ô¨Årst order model using liquid phasecopper concentration in Eq. (2) for the sorption ofcopper(II) onto peat at various initial copper(II) con-centrations for the initial 20 min. Fig. 3 shows a plot ofthe linearized form of the pseudo-second order modelin Eq. (17) for the sorption of copper(II) onto peat atvarious initial copper(II) concentrations. The correla-tion coefÔ¨Åcients for the linear plots of t:q
tagainst time
from the pseudo-second order rate law are greater than0.996 for all systems for contact times of 120 min. Thissuggests that this sorption system is not a Ô¨Årst orderreaction and that the pseudo-second order model,based on the assumption that the rate-limiting step maybe chemical sorption or chemisorption involving va-lency forces through sharing or exchange of electronsbetween sorbent and sorbate, provides the best correla-tion of the data.
Panday et al. [42] have found that for sorption of
chromium(VI) using a homogeneous mixture of Ô¨Çy ashand wollastonites is Ô¨Årst governed by diffusion followedby surface compound formation. Multiple pseudo-Ô¨Årstorder kinetics have been represented in some sorptionsystems such as proteins :silica [23], mercury(II) :kaolin-
ite [21] and persostent :kaolinite [24]. Basically a multi-
ple pseudo-Ô¨Årst order process means that a plot ofln(q
1qt) versus time can be divided into two or three
linear sections, each linear section representing apseudo-Ô¨Årst order reaction mechanism. In the multipleÔ¨Årst order kinetics sorption process, one stage corre-sponds to the initial binding or anchorage of proteinmolecules with the active spots of the solid surface byremoval and reorganization of surface-bound water.The other stage represents the denaturation and reorga-nization of the bound biopolymer at the interface,leading to the formation of spread Ô¨Ålms [23]. Atun andSismanoglu [24] reported that in the case of two kineticsteps, the Ô¨Årst step of sorption was more rapid than the1

Fig. 23. Pseudo-second order sorption kinetics of cadmium(II) onto
dry reed leaves at various initial concentrations.nol (PNP) from aqueous solution by Ô¨Çy ash are en-
dothermic sorption processes. Intraparticle diffusion wasfound to be rate-limiting following the pseudo-Ô¨Årst ordersorption rate expression of Lagergren [38]. The sorptionof copper(II) from water by both peanut hull carbon(PHC) and commercial granular activated carbon(GAC) also follows the pseudo-Ô¨Årst order sorption rateexpression of Lagergren [3]. In addition, Salim et al. [27]reported that the uptake of cadmium(II) on beech leavesis a Ô¨Årst order reaction with respect to cadmium(II) andthe rate-limiting step is mainly diffusion. Salim et al. [28]reported that the reaction mechanism process was thesorption of lead(II) on cypress leaves. The rate-limitingstep was concluded to be Ô¨Ålm diffusion, followed by afractional order kinetic step of 0.7. Gupta et al. [45]reported that the sorption of Omega Chrome Red ME(OCRME) from water by Ô¨Çy ash is a Ô¨Årst order exother-mic process. A Ô¨Årst order rate expression [2], Eq. (9),based on solution concentration has been used to repre-sent the sorption of Omega Chrome Red ME using Ô¨Çyash. However, the best Ô¨Åt model for all these sorptionsystems might possibly be the pseudo-second ordersorption rate expression. Figs. 4‚Äì17 show plots of thelinearized form of the pseudo-second order model in Eq.(18) for all 12 of these sorption systems. The correlationcoefÔ¨Åcients for the linear plots of t:q
tagainst time from
the pseudo-second order rate law are greater than 0.982for all systems.
Removal of copper(II) and lead (II) from wastewater
by sorption on bottom ash has been reported [36]. Fig.18 shows contact time curves with bottom ash and theresults are also shown in Fig. 19 as a plot of t:q
tagainst
time for sorption of copper(II) and lead(II) for thepseudo-second order model. The values of the correla-tion coefÔ¨Åcients are all extremely high ( \0.990). The
sorption of phosphate using both unrinsed and rinsedtamarind nut shell activated carbon (TNSAC) has beeninvestigated [37]. Fig. 20 shows contact time curves withbottom ash and the results are also shown in Fig. 21 asa plot of t:q
tagainst time for sorption of phosphate for
the pseudo-second order model. The values of thecorrelation coefÔ¨Åcients are all extremely high ( \0.998).
The removal of cadmium(II) from aqueous solution byreed leaves has been studied [40]. Fig. 22 shows a seriesof contact time curves with bottom ash and the resultsare also shown in Fig. 23 as a plot of t:q
tagainst time
for sorption of phosphate for the pseudo-second ordermodel. The values of the correlation coefÔ¨Åcients are allextremely high (\0.991).
5. Conclusions
The kinetics of sorption of Victoria Blue, aromatic
compounds, p-nitrophenol and o-cresol, a chrome dye,
Omega Chrome Red ME (OCRME) on Ô¨Çy ash, ofsecond one and the sorption rate is controlled by either
a Ô¨Ålm diffusion or an intraparticle diffusion mechanism.This might be because kaolinite is a clay and its macro-scopic structure is probably closer to a micro-porous‚Äòhoneycomb‚Äô than a macroporous ‚Äòcapillary‚Äô system [85].Furthermore, Varshney et al. [22] reported that thekinetics of sorption of the pesticide phosphamidon onbeads of antimony(V) phosphate cation exchanger wascompleted in two steps. In the Ô¨Årst step, the sorbatemolecules are sorbed on the surface where there are noother such molecules and consequently the sorbate‚Äìsor-bate interaction is negligible, leading to the formation ofa monolayer. As this monolayer approaches saturation,a process of rearrangement may start with a furtherincrease in the sorbate molecules, which constitutes thesecond step.
A comparison of the mechanisms from the literature
and the pseudo-second order analysis from this study isshown in Table 2. The pseudo-Ô¨Årst order sorption rateexpression of Lagergren has been widely used. Manystudies have been investigated: Khare et al. [34] reportedthat the sorption of Victoria Blue by Ô¨Çy ash is diffusioncontrolled and the process follows the pseudo-Ô¨Årst ordersorption rate expression of Lagergren; the sorption ofnickel(II) by wollastonite is diffusion controlled and theprocess follows the pseudo-Ô¨Årst order sorption rateexpression of Lagergren [3]; the sorption of low levelchromium(VI) from aqueous solution by bismuth triox-ide is an exothermic sorption process and follows thepseudo-Ô¨Årst order sorption rate expression of Lagergren[39]; and the sorption of o-cresol (OCL) and p-nitrophe-Y.S.Ho,G.McKay :Process Biochemistry 34 (1999) 451‚Äì465 463
copper(II) on peat and bottom ash, bicarbonate-treated
peanut hulls (PHC) and activated carbon (GAC), ofnickel(II) on wollastonite, of chromium(VI) on Bi
2O3,
of cadmium(II) on beech and reed leaves, of lead(II) oncypress leaves and bottom ash and phosphate ontamarind nut shell activated carbon (TNSAC) wereanalysed on the basis of the pseudo-second order ratemechanism. For all of the systems studied, chemicalreaction seems signiÔ¨Åcant in the rate-controlling stepand the pseudo-second order chemical reaction kineticsprovide the best correlation of the experimental data,whereas the pseudo-Ô¨Årst order model proposed Ô¨Åts theexperimental data well for an initial period of the Ô¨Årstreaction step only. However, over a long period thepseudo-second order model provides the best correla-tion for all of the systems studied.
