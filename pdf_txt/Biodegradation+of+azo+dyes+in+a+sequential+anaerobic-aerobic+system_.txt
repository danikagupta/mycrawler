Abstract: The main objective of this study was to investigate the efficiency of biological treatment
of azo dye-containing wastewater with a sequencing batch reactor system, followed by
ultrafiltration. The performance of the system was quantified by measuring the
chemical oxygen demand and azo dye concentration. The biodegradation was carried
out under combined alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions with Nylosan yellow
E2RL SGR as a model azo dye contaminant. The bioprocess revealed a maximal
reduction of chemical oxygen demand and dye removal efficiency of 91% and 85%,
respectively. After ultrafiltration of effluent from the biological treatment, the efficiency
increased to 94% for chemical oxygen demand and to 97% for the azo dye
decolourisation. Samples of activated sludge from the bioprocess were collected for
microbial characterisation. Bacteria and fungi were isolated and identified by 16S rRNA
gene and ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 sequence analysis, respectively. Serratia marcescens
and Klebsiella oxytoca were the most common bacteria with the highest number
present during the aerobic and anaerobic phases of the bioprocess. In addition, a high
number of Elizabethkingia miricola, Morganella morganii, Comamonas testosterone,
Trichosporon sp. and Galactomyces sp. were detected. Taken together, our results
demonstrated that the sequencing batch reactor system combined with ultrafiltration is
an efficient technique for treatment of wastewater containing azo dye. Moreover, the
ultrafiltration effectively removes the microbiota from the final effluent resulting in stable

 The reductive cleavage of azo 
compounds to aromatic amines needs  
anaerobic  conditions and then 
bacterial biodegradation of the 
aromatic amines is aerobic process. 
Therefore, a combined anaerobic –
aerobic bacterial  process is most 
effective .  
Unfortunately, currently we are not 
able to do some more tests regarding 
this to proof the detoxified effluent .  4.            Actually, I'm interested in 
the re -coloration process. Is it still 
toxic? Can you do more experiments 
to prove it? Because we know the 
degradation products of azo dye under 
anaerobic condition are more toxic 
than azo dyes. And will any method 
solve it?

 1. Introduction  1 
The textile industry is  a large  water consumer and overall the sector in Europe is suffering due 2 
to more stringent wastewater discharge limits, raising water costs and limited water resources. 3 
Consequently, t he sector is losing competitiveness on international markets, which results in 4 
closure of companies and re -location to countries outside of Europe. Thus , in order to ensure a 5 
future competitive European textile industry there is a need to provide efficient  treatment 6 
solutions for textile waste water with final effluent s that can be discharged or reused.  7 
 8 
Raw textile waste waters typically ha ve a high  chemical oxygen demand  (COD ) and contain a 9 
wide -variety of contaminants, such as salts, surfactants, soaps, enzymes, oxidizing  and reducing 10 
agents and reactive dyes (Hao et al., 2000 , Solís et al., 2012 ). Most of the coloured, high 11 
molecular -weight dye compounds are resistant to biological degradation, especiall y reactive 12 
dyes which can persist in the environment under natural conditions for 40 years  or more (Hao 13 
et al., 2000 , Brás et al., 2001 , Khehra et al.,  2006 ). Conventional biological wastewater 14 
processes can reduce COD significantly. However, these processes do not eliminate dyes. The 15 
combined ability to minimize COD and colourisation is of par amount importance in order to 16 
reuse the final effluent. Thus, a combination of different techniques is required (Hao et al., 17 
2000 ). 18 
 19 
Biotechnological treatment approaches (anaerobic or aerobic digestion or a combination of the 20 
two) for decolourising azo -containing wastewaters have been demonstrated  (Saratale et al., 21 
2011 , Wu et al., 2012 ). Under aerobic conditions, e.g. in activated sludge systems for 22 
wastewater treatment, azo dye decolourisation can be achieved , although with low activity as 23 
oxygen is a more effective electron acceptor than the azo dyes (Chengalroyen and Dabbs, 2013 ). 24 
On the other hand, under anaerobic conditions, e.g. by using granular or flocc ulent sludges, azo 25 
dyes are generally the sole terminal electron acceptor and, because of this, a better 26 
decolo urisation is obtained. The reduced products of anaerobic treatment (aromatic amines) are, 27 
in general, recalcitrant which means that complete biodegradation of azo dyes cannot be 28 
accomplished under anaerobic conditions only. However, bioconversion of these aromatic 29 
compounds under aerobic conditions is relatively quick  and t he reduction of azo dyes is 30 
generally regarded as a rate -limiting step i n the overall biodegradation (Chen, 2006 , 31 
Chengalroyen and Dabbs, 2013 , Solís et al., 2012 ). 32 
 33 
In microbial consortia , micro -organisms work synergistically , meaning that  individual strains 34 
may degrade the dye molecule at different positions or may utilise metabolites produced by co - 35 
existing strains for further mineralisation  (Chengalroyen and Dabbs, 2013 ). Besides , microbial  36 
cultures can h ave a broad spectrum for dye decolourisation due to variations in the enzymatic 37 
reactions of individual types of micro -organism s (Chengalroyen and Dabbs, 2013 ). It has been 38 
reported that azo dyes were almost completely decol ourised by Pseudomonas sp. (Phugare et 39 
al., 2011 , Jadhav et al., 2010 ). Some bacteria , such as Sphingomonas  use the dye as a carbon 40 
source (Ayed et al., 2011 ), and also Geobacillus  which removed  efficient ly dye Orange II from 41 
sewage of textile effluent (Evangelista -Barreto et al., 2009 ). Also other  bacterial genera,  such 42 
as Acetobacter , Bacil lus, Xanthomonas , Morganella , Aeromonas , Klebsiella  and others  are 43 
reported as azo dye decolourisers (Solís et al., 2012 ). 44 
 45 
Sequencing batch reactor ( SBR) presents a simplistic and flexibile unit in which combined 46 
aerobic/anaerobic rea ctions at low costs are possible to be carried out  (Al-Amrani et al., 2014 , 47 
Hosseini Koupaie et al., 2011 ). It has been widely us ed in recent studies  to achieve  dye removal 48 
(Rajaguru et al. , Lourenço et al., 2000 , Sponza and Işik, 2002 , Ong et al., 2005 , Panswad et al., 49 
2001 ) and operates by  sequential stages of wastewater feeding, re active phase  (anaerobic and/or 50

 aerobic  digestion ), sedimentation , and discharge of the clarified effluent and sludge. The 1 
reactive phase can be modified during operation and adjusted to achiev e optimal results for dye 2 
degradation and the removal of other contaminants.  The effluent from the SBR can be  then 3 
treated with ultrafiltration (UF) or nanofiltration (NF)  based on demands for the effluent 4 
characteristics  (Zuriaga -Agustí et al., 2010 ). 5 
 6 
Çinar et al. (2008 ) assessed the effect of a cycle length  (composed of anaerobic  and aerobic  7 
phase ) on decolourization  of a model textile dye waste water containing  the remazol brilliant 8 
violet 5R (RBV -5R) as a model  azo dye . They assessed  the cycle length of 12, 24 and 48  hours 9 
in a SBR system and identified the cycle length of 24 hours (each of anaerobic and aerobic 10 
treatm ent proceeded for 12 hours)  as optimal for dye degradation . This study  did not, however,  11 
investigate d the effect of  anaerobic and  aerobic phase length on the biodegradation , the 12 
characteristic  which is an important parameter for optimization of  SBR -based  treatment 13 
process .  14 
 15 
The aim of the present study was to optimize  the time length  of each treatment phase , aerobic  16 
and anaerobic , for maximal COD and dye removal  in a lab -scale SBR -UF system  using  the 17 
Nylosan Yellow E2RL SGR  as a model azo dye . In additio n, the microbial consortium was 18 
investigated in order to identify  microorganisms  with the highest  capabilities for colour 19 
degradation .  20 
 21 
The study was carried out between March 2013 and March 2014, at the Faculty of Chemistry 22 
and Chemical Engineering and Faculty  of Natural Sciences and Mathematics , University of 23 
Maribor, Slovenia.  24 
 25 
2. Material s and methods  26 
2.1 Chemicals  27 
The azo dye (C.I. index name “acid yellow 256” and commercial name Nylosan Yellow E2RL 28 
SGR) was supplied by Clariant, (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Nutrient Broth no 3 (Sigma - 29 
Aldrich) with composition of meat extract 1.0 g/L, yeast extract 2.0 g/L, peptone 5.0 g/L, and 30 
sodium  chloride 5.0 g/L was used as  micro -organism  nutrient . All other chemicals were 31 
analytical grade (AR) and were obtained from Sigma Aldrich or Fluka.  32 
2.2 Synthetic wastewater  33 
Synthetic textile wastewater was prepared with the azo dye, nutrient broth and D -glucose as 34 
indicated in Table 1. D-glucose was added as carbon source as azo dyes  by themselves  cannot 35 
provide a carbon and/or nitrogen source for micro -organisms (Sani and Banerjee, 1999 , Saratale 36 
et al., 2011 ). 37

After the process had started the micro -organisms were gradually adapted to high nutrient 2 
concentration (13 g/L) by linearly increasing the concentration of azo dye and D -glucose unt il 3 
Day 21. For the remaining time these concentrations were kept constant under low nutrient 4 
conditions.  5 
  6 
2.3 Sequencing batch reactor system  7 
Initially, a 10 L SBR was seeded with 1.5 L of activated slu dge from the municipal  wastewater 8 
treatment plant ( biomass concentration of 5.5 g/L), and 0.5 L of synthetic wastewater with dye 9 
concentration from 20 to 80 mg/L (see Table 1) . The SBR was operated in 24 h our cycles. Each 10 
cycle comprised of periods of filling (5 min), reaction & settlement (total 23.5 h our), drawing 11 
(10 min) and idling (25 min), where the reaction and settlement times were varied. During 12 
filling 0.5 L model wastewater influent was injected into the reactor at a rate of 100 ml/min and 13 
the same volume was taken during drawing for analysis. Th e temperature was between 22 °C 14 
and 26 °C. The dissolved oxygen was between 0.02 and 0.18 mg O 2/L and 2.7 mg O 2/L within 15 
anaerobic and aerobic phase s. Aeration was performed by an aquarium aerator ( Tetra WP600 , 16 
Tetra Werke, Melle, Germany ) through  porous stones inserted at  the bot tom of the reactor. The 17 
aerator  was connected to a timing device  allowing for control of aerobic and anoxic periods. 18 
During the entire operation (except the idling period) the reactor was stirred at 50 rpm  by 19 
magnetic stir rer.  20 
 21 
2.4 Ultrafiltration process  22 
The SBR effluent was filtered through an MN617 cellulose filter paper with 7 -12 µm retention 23 
(Macherey -Nagel, Düren, Germany) followed by  filtration through a n ultrafiltration  UF PAN 24 
membrane ( Alfa Laval, Denmark ), see Table 2. The operating pressure s for the filtration steps 25 
were  300 – 400 kPa  in dead -end configuration .   26 
2.5 Analytical methods  27 
Dyestuff colour, COD  concentration, pH, and mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) 28 
concentrations were measured in supernatants f rom samples centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 10 min 29 
at 26 ± 1 °C. Nylosan yellow concentration was measured using  the absorbance peak at 384 nm 30 
measured with  a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Instrument, model 61103A , Ma ribor , 31 
Slovenia) , see Fig. 1 . Absorbance was translated into concentrations (mg/L) using a standard 32 
curve (R2 = 0.998) thus allowing for determination of ci(0) and ci(t) of the dye at time 0 and t, 33 
respectively.  34 
 35 
pH measurements were  performed with a pH meter (MA 5740 , Iskra, Slovenia ). COD analyses 36 
were performed by the SIST ISO 6060 method with titrimetric determination and MLSS was 37 
measured according to the sta ndard weight method  (APHA, 2006 ). 38 
 39 
The COD and colour removal efficiency of the process was calculated as  40 
 41 
𝑅𝐸=𝑐𝑖(0)−𝑐𝑖(𝑡)
𝑐𝑖(0)×100%       Eq. 1  42 
 43 
where ci(0) and ci(t) are the initial concentration value of component i (at process start) and after 44 
reaction time ( t). 45

 2.6 Isolation and identification of microorganisms  1 
Samples of d iluted activated sludge from anaerobic and aerobic phases  of the SBR process w ere 2 
plated on a complex NA agar (Nutrient Agar , Sigma ) containing acid dye  and incubated for 3 
four days at room temperature (22 ‒ 26oC). The number of colonies was expressed as CFU/mL. 4 
Each type of morphologically different colonies was  further purified to isolate the pure strains. 5 
The isolates were grown in liquid nutrient media, and harvested for DNA isolation by 6 
NucleoSpin Tissue kit (Macherey -Nagel, Düren, Germany). The bacterial 16S r RNA gene  7 
sequences  were specifically amplified by  PCR reaction using primers 16SFw (5' - 8 
AAATTGAAGAGTTTGATCATGGC -3') and rH1542 (5' -AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA - 9 
3') as described previously  (Slapšak et al., 2013 ). Primers 18F1 (5’ - 10 
AGGTTTCCGTAGGTGAACCT -3’) and ITS4 (5’ - TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC -3’) were 11 
used for amplifica tion of the ITS1 -5.8S rDNA -ITS2  fungal region  as described by  Štornik et  12 
al. (2016 ). The PCR product s were cleaned by NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean -up kit 13 
(Macherey -Nagel, Düren, Germany) and the sequences were determined at Eurofins Genomics 14 
(Ebersberg, Germany). The sequences were analysed by Blastn (NCBI, 15 
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) . The i solates were assigned to the genus/species to 16 
which the sequences  showed the highest identity.  17

3. Results  and discussion  19 
The SBR  treatment  started under anaerobic conditions and followed by aerobic conditions 20 
within a treatment cycle of 24 hours , see Table 3. The entire 24 h our treatment cycle consisted 21 
of filling,  anaerobic phase,  aerobic phase, settling phase, drawing phase and idling phase. The 22 
24 hours cycle with anaerobic  and aerobic  phase s has been used  also in other studies (Lourenço 23 
et al., 2001 , Kapdan and Oztekin, 2006 , Hakimelahi et al., 2012 ). In order to optimise the SBR 24 
process for optimal dye degradation and removal of other contaminants , a total of 1 00 days of 25 
SBR operation was divided into t hree periods , designated  A, B and C . For each of the period s 26 
the time length of anaerobic and aerobic  phase s varied  (presented in Table 3 ). 27 
 28 
3.1 COD and colour removal efficiency in the SBR process  29 
COD and colour removal efficiency as well as increase of biomass growth  and pH values  were 30 
monitored. Samples were taken at the beginning of the reaction phase  (feed) , and at the end of 31 
the 24 hour cycl e. Performance of the SBR process was evaluated based on measurements of 32 
the COD and dye concentration at the influent and effluent of the SBR process . The results for 33 
the 100 days of operation are shown in Fig s. 2a and 2b. During the first 24 days of operation 34 
the colour removal efficiency fluctuated around 60% while the COD remova l efficiency 35 
increased  from 70 to 90 %. The removal efficiency can be compared with other studies (Kapdan 36 
and Oztekin, 2 006). During this time the reactor was operated according to the period A 37 
described  in Table 3 . The reason for the low dye removal during period A could be micro - 38 
organisms that have not yet been sufficiently adapted to the solution containing dye molecules. 39 
As dye substances are difficult to be degraded, more time is required to accumulate sufficient 40 
micro -organisms for dye degradation.   41 
 42 
Azo dyes can be de graded  by microbial consortium under anaerobic conditions . The product s 43 
of these  reaction s are aromatic amines  (Chengalroyen and Dabbs, 2013 ). A longer an aerobic  44 
reaction phase has been  shown to result in a higher dye decolourization efficiency (Al-Amrani 45 
et al., 2014 ). Therefore, the anaerobic phase duration was increased from 9 to 11 hours on day 46 
24 in an attempt to increase dye removal efficiency. Thus, the duration s of aerobic and settling 47 
phase s were reduced by one hour each. This operation al mode is described as period B in Table 48 
3. However, this change did not increase the colour removal efficiency significantly (Fig. 2a). 49

 In fact , it led to a decrease in COD removal efficiency  as presented in  Fig. 2b. After three days  1 
of lag phase , the COD removal efficiency d ecreased from 90% an d stabilised  at a value around 2 
50% at day 40. As the prolonged  anaerobic phase did not le ad to an increase in dye removal 3 
and also COD removal efficiency was reduced , the SBR operating conditions was changed at 4 
day 58  by reducing  the anaerobic phase to 9 hours , increasing  the aerobic phase to 13 hour s and 5 
keeping the settling phase at 1.5 hour s (presented as  period  C in Table 3 ). This resulted in  colour  6 
removal at around 80% during the remaining experimental period albeit with som e fluctuations 7 
(Fig. 2a), and COD removal at around 90% after three days  of period C (Fig . 2b).  8 
 9 
In order to gain more insight into the effects of changing the SBR operating conditions , colour 10 
degradation and C OD removal during the 24 hour cycle  were  analysed at four selected points : 11 
at day 17  of period A, on which  COD removal ha s stabili sed, at day 24 , immediately  after 12 
changing from period  A to B , at day 39 of period  B where the dye removal efficiency reached 13 
80% and COD removal had stabilis ed around 50%  and at  day 73 of period  C where COD 14 
removal efficiency ha s increased  to 90% in average while dye removal has stabilized at  around 15 
80%. The se data are presented  in Fig s. 3a-d and Figs. 4a-d. 16 
 17 
In general, the majority of the dye removal occurred in the anaerobic phases, as also  observ ed 18 
by Hakimelahi et al.  (2012 ). Re-colourisation during the  aerobic phase  has also been  observed  19 
in earlier work (Cruz and Buitron, 2001 , Libra et al., 2004 , Sponza and Işık, 2005 ) and has been 20 
explained by unstable aromatic amines being generated as a by -product of dye degrada tion 21 
under anaerobic conditions . These amines can easily oxidis e and re -colour when exposed to 22 
oxygen during the aerobic phases. In addition , absorption of colour into the sludge biomas s 23 
may also influence  on the overall removal  efficiency  (Otero et al., 2003 , Wang et al., 2006 , 24 
Sirianuntapiboon and Srisornsak, 2007 ).  25 
 26 
Early in the process ( day 17) a pronounced re-colouration in the anaerobic phase was observed . 27 
Although  dye removal efficiency reached 50% during the anaerobic phase , the efficiency 28 
declined during the aerob ic phase resulting in an overall poor performance.  At day 24 , just after 29 
entering period B (with an increased anaerobic phase fr om 9 hours to 11 hours), re-coloura tion 30 
in the anaerobic phase was less pronounced, however, dye removal efficiency never exceeded  31 
35%. A t day 39 , after 15 days under period B conditions,  dye removal efficiency increased  to 32 
43% at the end of the anaerobic phase , reaching almost 60% at the end of the aerobic phase.  At 33 
day 73 of period B no re -colouration in the anaerobic phase was observed and the removal 34 
efficiency reached 65% before entering the aerobic phase . Despite a slight decrease , to about 35 
60% at the end of the aerobic phase, the overall performance ( reflected in the area under the 36 
curve) was optimal , demonstrating the feasi bility of SBR -based dye degradation.   37 
 38 
Figs. 4a-d are presenting  the corresponding COD values during the 24 h our cycle. Generally, 39 
the COD measurements showed  that the COD substantially reduced  during the aerobic phase. 40 
The average removal efficiency at days 17, 24, and 73 were 34.7%, 63.9%, and 56.8% , 41 
respectively . This is consistent with the results of Asadi et al.  (2012 ) who studied the effect of 42 
hydraulic  retention time  and aeration time on COD removal in a bioreactor. The efficiency at 43 
day 39 was only 4% which likely reflects the formation of inhibitory products within  the 44 
microbial consortium . Thus , in conclusion, COD removal was  the most efficient within period  45 
C, concomitantly with  the highest degree  of dye removal.  46 
 47 
Concomitantly with  the changes of dye concentrations and COD reduction , we analysed the 48 
overall changes in biomass  density  and pH values. The results are presented  in Figs. 5a-b. 49 
During the first ten days after the inoculation of the activated sludge, the biomass decreased 50

 slightl y what is  consistent with the fact that t he micro -organisms were introduced into the 1 
system  from an open tank with aerobic conditions , whereas  in a closed system the alternating 2 
anaerobic and aerobic conditions  were provided . In addition, temperature, composition of the 3 
nutritional broth, and pH values were different i n our SBR  system in compar ison to the original 4 
ecological conditions  from where the activated originated . After th e lag phase , the sludge 5 
concentration increas ed up to day 34 (first part of period B) indicating  the exponential growth 6 
phase  of biomass . Between days 34 and 40 (second part of period  B) the sludge concentration 7 
only increas ed very little. After day 40 the biomass was decaying , indicat ing the depletion of 8 
the nutrients in the medium, and the formation of inhibitory products. After entering period C  9 
during which  the duration of the aerobic reaction phase was extend ed, the biomass 10 
concentration increased to  around 11 g/L.  Before  biomass decrease  in period B , the pH  values  11 
at the end of the anaerobic reaction phase and pH of  the effluent  dropped significantly. Finally, 12 
at the beginning of period C, pH values were restored to  values of  period A.     13 
 14 
When comparing COD removal (Fig. 2b) with biomass growth in the SBR  (Fig. 5a), one can 15 
observe that the COD removal was maximal d uring the exponential growth of micro -organisms 16 
(during period A). The decrease in  COD removal efficiency in the effluent is evident after day 17 
33 of period B and correlates with the observed effluent pH changes . The decrease in COD 18 
removal also manifested itself by changes in odour, higher turbidity, and lower settling ability. 19 
The results in Fig. 5b illustrate how the pH values of influent and effluent can be used as  one 20 
of the indicator s of a well-running SBR bioprocess . The pH values of the activated sludge were 21 
between 5.5 and 7.5 after the anaerobic reaction phase and between 8 and 9 at the end of the 22 
SBR cycle. During  period B the pH values of effluent dropped from around 9 to below 6 at day 23 
37 and COD removal efficiency was still 70%. Two  days later the COD removal efficiency 24 
dropped to around 42% . 25 
 26 
3.2 UF treatment contribution on SBR effluent   27 
The effluent from the SBR was subjected to UF treatment . In order to assess the efficiency of 28 
the UF treatment two representative effluent samples  were selected , one from day 33 of period  29 
B where biodegradation was efficient  in terms of COD removal and one from day 67 of period  30 
C where degradation efficiency was low.  This allowed  for evaluating the UF treatment as a 31 
counter -measure when  the biolog ical process  as such is not effi cient enough.  The collected SBR 32 
effluent was first filtered through cellulose filter paper to prevent membrane fouling and 33 
afterwards passed on to the  UF cell. The results of the trea tments with SBR, UF , and the 34 
combin ed method are shown in Table s 4 and 5  where  RE indicate s the removal efficiency in %  35 
(Eq. 1). 36 
 37 
When the SBR was running efficiently ( day 33) the UF treatment reduced effluent dye 38 
concentration almost tenfold. When the SBR degradation process in terms of COD removal 39 
was impaired ( day 67) , UF treatment reduced effluent dye concentration only by 40%. As the 40 
colour is visible to the naked eye at concentrations as low as 1 mg/L (Öztekin, 2004 ), UF 41 
treatment is not in itself sufficient to obtain colourless effluent. However, UF treatment has the 42 
highest efficiency for colour removal when the SBR process is effective in terms of COD 43 
removal. The COD concentrations were also decreased by the UF tr eatment by approximately 44 
41% at day 33 and by 48 % at day 67 i.e. the effect of UF on COD removal was strongest when 45 
the SBR was working under less than optimal conditions. Still when the SBR was working well 46 
(day 33) the combined SBR+UF treatment resulted in dye and COD removal efficiencies of 47 
96.6% and 94% respectively.  48

 3.3 Character isation  of the SBR microbial consortium  1 
In order to gain insight into the SBR microbial composition , facultative  aerobic micro - 2 
organisms  were isolated  from the SBR sludge.  The prevalent bacteria were Serratia 3 
marcescens , Klebsiella oxytoca , Elizabethkingia miricola , and Morganella morganii  (presented 4 
in Table 6 ). Serratia sp., Klebsiella sp. and Morganella sp. are classified into  the family 5 
Enterobacteriaceae . They are Gram -negative, facultative aerobic, oxidase negative ba cteria . 6 
Many of them are part of the intestinal flora, and their typical habitats are soil  and water.  Their 7 
growth is stimulated at aerobic conditions , what happened also  during the SBR  process . Several 8 
studies have report ed the strong ability o f Klebsiella oxytoca  to metaboli se toxic compounds 9 
(Wong and Yuen, 1996 , Kao et al., 2003 ). Klebsiella oxytoca  isolated from cyanide  containing 10 
wastewater was also able to use n itriles as the sole source of nitrogen (Kao et al., 2003 ). Wong  11 
and Yuen  (Wong and Yuen, 1996 ) isolated five bacteria from dye contaminated sludge and 12 
found that  Klebsiella sp. and K. pneumon iae showed decolouris ation ability . The bacteria  13 
Morganella morganii  also effectively  decolourise  and degrade the multi -sulphonated azo dye 14 
RB-B (Kitts et al., 1994 ) without formation of toxic metabolities. The bacteria identified in here 15 
presented work are therefore consistent with  the results of  previous studies.  Besides the 16 
bacteria , two types of fungi, Trichosporon  sp. (1.5 x 103 CFU/mL) and Galactomyces  sp. (2.5 17 
x 103 ‒ 3.5 x 103 CFU/mL) were also detected.   18 
 19 
3.3.1 The decolourisation ability of specific micro -organisms  20 
In order to assess the colour degrading ability of single isolates , we cultured individual micro - 21 
organisms in nutrient broth containing acid azo dye (60 mg/L) under static conditions at room 22 
temperature. During the process t he absorbance was followed (reflecting colour removal)  (Fig. 23 
6). Elizabethkingia miricola  show ed the highest rate - nearly 70 % of  decolouris ation after 10 24 
days of incubation. The decolouris ation efficiency  of Trichosporon sp., C. testosteroni  and M. 25 
morganii  were approximately 50%. Galactomyces sp. decolouris ed wastewater by 1 4%. 26 
 27 
4. Conclusions  28 
A stable microbial consortium was cultivated within a single SBR system with alternating 29 
anaerobic  and aerobic reaction phase s. The microbiota performed  azo dye colour removal and 30 
COD re duction  in a model azo day solution. After  UF treatment of the SBR effluent , the 31 
removal efficiency was 94% for COD and 9 7% for the azo dye. In the SBR process, the 32 
predominant bacterial species were Serratia marcescens  and Klebsiella oxytoca  followed by  33 
Elizabethkingia miricola, Morga nella morgan ii and Serratia sp. The microbial consortium also 34 
contained fungi  Trichosporon sp. and Galactomyces sp. Our results demonstrate d that the 35 
alternating anaerobic and aerobic SBR process com bined with UF treatment can reach  a high 36 
decolouration  efficiency  and COD re duction  of azo dye containing wastewater.  37
