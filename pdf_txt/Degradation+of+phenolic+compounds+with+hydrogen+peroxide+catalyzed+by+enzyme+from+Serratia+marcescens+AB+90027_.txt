Resorcinol was utilized as the sole carbon and energy source by Enterobacter cloacae  (identification by 
16S rDNA nucleotide sequencing Genbank Accession Number JN093148). The different conce ntration 
of resorcinol utilized by the bacterial isolate range d between 55 and 220 mg l-1 at 30°C and pH of 7.0 . It 
was observed that the batch experimental results  were  best fitted for Michaelis -Menten and Monod 
models (for 220 mg l-1 resorcinol) with tim e under defined  conditions . The kinetics constants for the 
Michaelis -Menten equation (enzyme kinetics) were  Km = 11.00 mM and V max = 0.03 mM  min-1 and for the 
Monod equation (growth kinetics) was  μmax = 0.0371 h-1 in the inhibitory region and K S = 22.09 mg l-1. It 
was assumed that enzyme reactions limit biomass production (Monod kinetics) during  resorcinol 
degradation  by E. cloacae . The enzyme kinetic model (Michaelis -Menten ) used was fit to the r esorcinol 
degradation profiles with a set of model parameters such as using pre -induced E. cloacae  cells  on 220 
mg l-1 resorcinol .

INTRODUCTION  
 
Release of wastewater from  textile production is a major 
pollutant of watersheds around the world.  Dye waste -
water is not only toxic and mutagenic but has the ability 
to deconstruct ecosystems by blocking sunlight from 
reaching plant life upon release of the color into the 
environm ent. Studies of industrial areas where azo dyes 
are in use have connected azo dye presence in soil, 
surface water, and groundwater to the direct deterioration 
of th ese areas (Pandey et al., 2007).  Azo dyes have a 
wide app eal throughout textile, leather  and paper Indus -
tries, as they are the largest class of synthetic dyes and contain the broadest color variations (Balan  et al., 2001; 
Bafana et al., 2007; Pandey et al., 2007).  Specifically, 
their production was estimated in 1 994 to comprise 50% 
of the then annual global production of one million tons of 
commercial dyes  (Pandey et al., 2007) . The textile Indus -
try effluent requires decolorization  due to the high 
percen tage of dye in the wastewater effluent (10  to 15%) 
(Bafana et al., 2007).  This can be a major  problem for 
that industry considering that some dyes are not de -
colorized at concentrations as low as 1 mg l-1 (Pandey et 
al., 2007).

Resorcinol has been  selected as a model compound 
for this study because it is a precursor to azo dyes and is 
dihydroxy  benzene or hydroxy aromatic compound, 
containing two hydroxyl groups in the meta  position of the 
phenol ring (Ferreira Guedes et al., 2010; PubChem 
NCBI).  Resorcinol is commonly used as an industrial 
solvent and raw material in the leather, textile, paper, 
pharmaceutical, steel, cosmetics , and petrochemical 
Indus tries.  Resorcinol is distinctly used in the cosmetics 
industry as a disinfectant and exfoliating a gent for many 
acne treatments which may cause thyroid defects with 
daily use (Ferreira Guedes et al ., 2010).  Resorcinol’s 
solubility in water is 1100 g/L at 20 °C. It is flammable 
when unprotected against high temperatures or oxidants, 
is more toxic than ph enol, and causes severe body 
impairment if ingested or if it c omes in contact with skin, 
eyes, or mucous membranes (Subramanyam and Mishra, 
2007; Ferreira Guedes et al., 2010).  A variety of kinetic 
substrate utilization and inhibition models have been 
used  to describe the dynamics of aerobic microbial 
growth on organic contaminants including phenol, ben -
zene, toluene, nitrophenol, catechol  and even orcinol, but 
not on resorcinol (Chapman and Ribbons, 1976; Zeyer 
and Kearney, 1984; Meulenberg et al., 1996; R eardon et 
al., 2000; Kim et al., 2005; Kumar et al., 2005; Yao et al., 
2006; Agarry and Solomon, 2008; Shumkova et al ., 
2009).  Resorcinol studies tend to focus more on degra -
dation under different levels of stress (Ferreira Guedes et 
al., 2010).  The presen t study focuses on kinetics of resor -
cinol in order to predict its degradation in both aerobically 
growing cells and resting cells using different initial sub -
strate concentrations.  
In this study , Monod and Michaelis -Menten mathema -
tical models were used t o anticipate and assess the 
biodegradation rates of resorcinol and illustrate the dyna -
mics of microbial growth in two experiments: growth/  
decay and resting cell.  To ensure the successful kinetic 
evaluation of the bacterial degradation of resorcinol, indi -
genous bacteria from the common effluent treatment 
plant, CETP (an industrial wastewater treatment facility) 
in Gujarat, India was used.  This is a similar approach to 
that used in the study by Shinozaki et al. (2002), which 
used indigenous bacteria to deg rade p-nitrophenol.  
Effective kinetics research investigates the degradation 
potential of bacteria.  In order to be successful, the ex -
periment requires a bacterium able to consume and 
utilize the resorcinol as its main carbon and energy 
source (Kim et al., 2005).  In this study, enzyme kinetics 
were applied to resorcinol degradation using 
Enterobacter  cloacae .  
The objective of this study was to investigate the degra -
dation potential of an indigenous E. cloacae  isolated from 
a wastewater treatment plant in G ujarat, India and the 
effect that initial resorcinol concentration has on its de -
gradation ability.  Few reports are available on the aerobic 
degradation kinetics of resorcinol . This study on a pure 
indigenous  isolated   facultative  anaerobic   bacterium, E. Jablonski et al.          3633  
 
 
 
cloacae , from a local industrial wastewater treatment faci -
lity appears to be  new. While most degradation studies 
occurred  under anaerobic conditions, an E. cloaca is  
shown here to work under microaerophilic and aerobic 
conditions.  Since the strain used in this study was iso-
lated from CETP effluent, chances of obtaining E. 
cloacae  with hazardous characteristics is very rare.  
Despite the fact that E. cloacae  is reported as a Class I 
(or Class II in Canada) biohazard, the strain isolated in 
this study is lacking hazardous status as determined by  
16S rDNA BLAST analysi s. In future studies,  the kinetics 
of E. cloacae  towards biodegrad ation of resorcinol in 
aerobic reactors could  be applicable if bioaugmented .  
 
 
MATERIALS AND  METHODS  
 
Resorcinol  substrate  
 
Resorcinol has been selected as a model compound for this study 
because it is a precursor to azo dyes, which are heavily produced 
and cause extensive environmental damage if left untreated prior to 
disposal.  Resorcinol is a dihydroxy benzene (Ferreira Guedes et al., 
2010; PubChem NCBI).  The chemical was purchased from Sigma -
Aldric h and its chemical formula is C 6H4-1,3-(OH) 2 and has a 
molecular weight of 110.11.  Spectrophotometer scanning deter -
mined resorcinol’s absorption ma xima (λ max) to be 274 nm (240 with 
0.1X NaOH dilution) (Perkin Elmer UV Lambda 900 WinLab).   
 
 
Isolation of microorganisms and culture conditions for growth 
and decay experiments  
 
Activated sludge, procured from the CETP in Gujarat State, India, 
was enrich ed wi th 110 mg l-1 resorcinol.  The sample s were covered 
in aluminum foil, to prevent photo -oxidation, and placed in 
Erlenmeyer flasks, sealed with cotton and paper, and stored in an 
orbital shaker for 4  - 5 days at 30°C and 120 rpm. After 4  - 5 days, 
100 µ l of growth cultures were spread onto 1X new minimal media 
(NMM) plates with 110 mg l-1 resorcinol substrate.  A 100 ml of 1X 
NMM plate solution consists of 0.2 ml 10% MgSO 4, 0.25 ml 10% 
NH 4Cl, 0.1 ml 100mM CaCl 2, 2 ml Hu tners Solution  (Selvakumaran 
et al., 2011) , 0.224 ml 1 M Phosphate  Buffer  with p H 7, 2% agar for 
solidification, with the remaining volume filled with deionized water.  
The new minimal media was amended with resorcinol ( 110 mg l-1) 
as the carbon substrate.  The bacteria that grew were consider ed to 
be using resorcinol as a carbon and energy source and in turn 
degrading the substrate.  The serial dilutions resulted in twelve 
individual bacteria isolates from which the NR-1 isolate (later 
identified as E. cloacae ) was chosen due to its strong degr adation 
potential  based on the color  change  seen in the samples . One 
colony of the isolate was transferred from the plate t o 5 - 10 ml of 
1X NMM broth with 55 mg l-1 resorcinol to cultivate biomass growth.  
All glassware was autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min.  
 
 
Biodegradation batch experiments  
 
The effect that the initial resorcinol concentration has on the E. 
cloacae growth kinetics was examined using the analysis of cell 
growth and resorcinol decay in batch experiments using spectro -
photometric curve analysis . Different  concentrations (2 20, 550, 880 
and 1100 mg l-1) of resorcinol were prepared in 100 ml of 0.1X 
NMM in 200 -250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks leaving headspace for 
oxygen levels sufficient for cell growth, sealed with cotton and  pa- 3634          Afr. J. Mi crobiol. Res.  
 
 
 
per, and stored in an orbital shaker at 120 RPM for 95 h at 30°C.  
Using a sterile pipette, samples were taken every 5  -12 h and either 
analyzed immediately or stored at -20°C. Samples were also drawn 
from un -inoculated control flasks that were also incubated and 
shaken equal to the others.  Since resorcinol compound is photo 
oxidizable, the presence of residual resorcinol during degradation 
experiments interferes with OD 600 estimation of cell growth.  To 
prevent the interference of photochemi cally oxidized resorcinol, 
samples were centrifuged to remove the brown colored oxidized 
resorcinol supernatant at 4°C after which the cells were resus -
pended in 1 ml of distilled water for OD 600 estimation.  The UV -
visible spectrophotometer absorbance of t he bacteria cells at 600 
nm determined the bacteria l growth, and the absorbance of the 
supernatant at 274 nm determined the resorcinol degradation.  All 
experiments were repeated three times at separate times to ensure 
accuracy  and mean values are shown . 
 
 
Growth kinetics  
 
The Monod equation was used for growth kinetics.  The Monod 
equation analyzes the utilization of substrate during concurrent 
bacterial growth or decay using specific growth rate and specific 
substrate consumption rate (Kim et al ., 2005; Ost endorf et al ., 
2007; Agarry and Solomon , 2008).  During the use of Monod 
kinetics , assumption  that enzyme reactions limit biomass production  
was allowed . Using a single bacterial isolate and a single substrate 
in minimal media allowed for little to no effec t on growth kinetics . 
The non -inhibitory Monod equation was used for this case looking 
for an increase in growth rate corresponding to an increased 
substrate concentration that reaches a maximum growth rate 
asymptotically (Kim et al., 2005).   
Monod kinetic s is an empirical model that can fit the substrate 
degradation of the resorcinol by E. cloacae  to the equation 
(Kovarova -Kovar and Egli, 1998; Ferreira Guedes et al., 2010):

where  is the specific growth rate per hour, max is the maximum 
biomass growth rate per hour taken as the maximum biomass on

initial substrate concentration in mg l-1, and X is the microbial cell 
concentration in mg l-1 found with : 
  
                                                                                  (2)

where m is biomass concentration in mg l-1. 
 
To solve for K S and μ max, the units of substrate were in  mg l-1 and 
biomass OD 600 was also in mg l-1. The mM conversion was done as 
follows : 2 mM or 2000 mole per liter of resorcinol is  multiplied by 
0.110 mg per mole (110 g is the molecular weight of resorcinol) 
amounting  to 220 mg per liter  as substrate (S) used initially.  For 
biomass , the cells taken w ere measured in terms of dry weight as 
330 mg  l-1. μ is found by using the first and last points from the 
exponential curve as m 1 and m 2, and t 1 and t 2.   
 
 
 
Biomass cultivation for resting cell experiment  
 
To cultivate the biomass of the E. cloacae for the resting cell 
experiment, test tubes of 1X Luria broth (10% tryptone, 5% yeast 
extract, 5 g  NaCl  per liter distilled water with  a pH of 7) with  55 mg l-1 
resorcinol were inoculated with E. cloacae  and placed in the orbital 
shaker at 30°C at 120 RPM.  Once the biomass exceeded an optical 
density (OD) of 1, the cells were transferred to 0.1X NMM.   
 
 
Respirometric analysis of resting cell experiment (cellular 
respiration)  
 
The objective of the resting cell experiment was to analyze all  the 
enzymes of the degradation pathway of resorcinol in  the E. cloacae  
isolate. It was assumed that in the resting cell experiment, cells pre -
grown on the resorcinol substrate will not  multiply , but the induced 
enzymes in bacterial cells will remain activated and react in the 
presence of the substrate; so degradation can be model ed using 
the Michaelis -Menten equation.  The aerobic bacteria  were  reported 
to undergo oxidative reactions yielding central intermediates 
(Reineke, 2001), from which  the oxygen uptake experiments were 
designed.  Cells pre -grown on resorcinol were considered as 
induced cells and were harvested to obtain resting cells.  Based on 
the growth curve results showing best growth peaks for E. cloacae 
at 1.5 h, cells were harvested at 1.5 h and then used for oxygen 
uptake analysis. Resting cell experiments require 1.0 OD600 of pre -
grown cells per 1 ml of media equivalent to 330 mg  l-1 with a 
concentration of substrate experimentally predetermined.  A digital 
oxygen system (model 10, Rank Brothers, Bottisham UK) was used 
to track the oxygen uptake changes over a total of 1 5 min  at 30 °C. 
The machine uses 3 ml of solution, constant stirring to allow for 
complete mixing.  The 50 mM phosphate buffer is added into the 
machine followed by 3 OD of E. cloacae . The initial 4 min s measure  
endogenous activity presenting  the absence of substrate.  After 180 
s, varying molarities of the substrate are added to the mixture and 
the readings are recorded for the next 11 min.  The o xygen uptake 
experiment is based on the resting cell s where the cells have grown 
using resorcinol as their carbon s ource and are then starved.  All the 
enzymes of the resorcinol degradation pathway are assumed to be 
induced while applying the oxygraph test.  Also, the Michaelis -
Menten enzyme kinetic model used was fit to the resorcinol 
degradation only with the use of pre-induced  E. cloacae cells as a 
set of model parameters.  The oxygen uptake reading in µmol min-1 
per mg cell is determined by the difference in slope of degradation 
before and after the substrate is added to the mixture followed by a 
division by the dissol ved oxygen in water (8 ppm) and multiplied by 
the mg of cells (0.33  g). The oxygen uptake rates were expressed 
as nanomoles of oxygen per minute per mg of cells. Weight of cells 
was determined by drying cell pellets at 70°C until a constant 
weight was obta ined.  
 
 
Enzyme kinetics  
 
Michaelis -Menten kinetics, also known as enzymatic kinetics, is 
related to Monod kinetics by using a similar equation but at steady 
state conditions; it is also known as Monod no -growth kinetics 
(Blum et al., 2009).  The steady stat e condition is created when the 
enzyme binds to the substrate faster than the product formation 
(Costa et al., 2010).  Use of the Michaelis -Menten equation tests all 
the enzymes of the pathway assuming that all of the enzymes act at 
the same time in the pre sence of one substrate and one product 
(Costa et al., 2010).  They must be tested during a steady state of 
zero growth and are therefore analyzed after resting cell experi -
ments with varying substrate concentrations using oxygen uptake 
which was  performed.  Varying substrate concentration s determine  
spanning from non -saturated to saturated, in order to derive the

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
Growth curve -degradation of resorcinol  
 
A resorcinol degrading bacteria, E. cloacae , was tested in  batch experiments using a single limiting substance to 
record its resorcinol biodegrading potential.  Growth curve 
experiments were conducted for initial substrate concen -
tration of 2 20 mg l-1 of resorcinol. Concentrations more 
than 220 mg l-1 such as  550, 880 and 1100 mg l-1 of 
resorcinol  were  also used to demonstrate the effect of the 
initial substrate c oncentration on E. cloacae  cell growth 
over a 95 -h time span using intermittent sampling . Higher 
concentrations were inhibitory for cells and also, due to 
self-photo oxidation characteristic of resorcinol (dark 
brown coloration) the spectrophotometric anal ysis of cell 
growth and residual resorcinol, caused interference for 
estimations  (data not shown) . The model concentration of 
resorcinol selected was 220 mg l-1 due to the success of 
the degradation coinciding with biomass growth.  Figure 1 
shows the result  where the 220 mg l-1 initial concentration 
of resorcinol in 0.1X NMM inoculated with E. cloacae  sig-
nificantly degrade d resorcinol . Table 1 lists the parameter 
values.  Following Reardon et al. (2000), death rates were 
set to zero to obtain best -fit result s. E. cloacae cells with 
an initial OD 600 of approximately 0.1 were in a lag phase 
for the first 10 h , while resorcinol had an initial OD 274 of 
approximately 4.0 for the same period of time.  Figure 1 
represents typical biomass growth since the degradation 
proceeds with cell growth.  This was followed by the ex -
ponential phase when cells at OD 600 increased to almost 
3.0 between 10 to 25 h , while the OD 274 of the super -
natant decreased to approximately 0.25 during the same 
period of time.  Biomass accumulation ended at approxi -
mately the same time that the consumption of the 
resorcinol ceased.  The final phase of the growth/decay 
was a stationary phase where both cells and supernatant

OD leveled off to a steady OD 600 of 0.2 and OD 274 of 0.4.  
Since resorcinol was utilized  by E. cloacae  (biomass 
increase) , it can be assumed that E. cloacae  can use 
resorcinol as its source of carbon .  
 
 
Monod kinetics  
 
Based on the growth curve (Fig ure 1) of E. cloacae , the 
decay of resor cinol was modeled by Monod kinetics 
(Equation 1 ). Monod kinetics require d S and biomass in 
mg l-1. μ is found in Equation 3 . State 1 is the initial condi -
tions and state 2 is chosen to be at the peak of the expo -
nential phase of the growth curve.  µmax is found by using 
the same equation as for µ, but looking at the highest value µ rather than the peak of the exponential phase of 
the curve.  At t 0, m 0 is 39.1050 mg l-1, at t 26, m 26 is 
94.0500 mg l-1 resulting in µ being 0.0338 h-1. At t 21, m 21 
is 85.3050 mg l-1 providing a µ max of 0.0371 h-1. Using this 
data, K S is 22.09 mg l-1. Degradation kinetics for resor -
cinol by E. cloacae  is being reported for the first time in 
this paper , whereas different strains of Pseudomonas 
putida  have been reported to degrade res orcinol and use 
it as it s sole carbon and energy source ( Chapman and 
Ribbons, 1976 ). Kinetic parameters of resorcinol degra -

Resting cell-degradation of resorcinol ( respirometric 
assays)  
 
Enzyme kinetics was studied when enzymes were 
activated but cell growth is  at rest.  A common model  for 
such enzymatic kinetics is the Mi chaelis -Menten equation 
(Equation 4). The resting cell experiment involve d gro-
wing 1 optical density (OD) of cells per 1 ml of media.  
Different concentrations of resorcinol substrate s below 
220 mg l-1 concentration were compared ( 55, 110, 165  
and 220 mg l-1). The study did not allow for the isolation 
of a single enzyme, but considered them as a single 
enzyme  in crude lysate form . Figure 2 presents the 
spectrophotometric analysis at absorbance 274 nm of the 
supernatant of the resting cells over a 5 -h span.  Solid 
lines represent supernatant measurements and dashed lines, the control.  Despite keeping samples covered in 
aluminum foil to prevent photo -oxidation, color change 
did occur.  In Fig ure 2, diamonds represent 220 mg l-1 
substrate sample starting at almost OD 290 of 0.6 and 
decreasing to 0.2; triangles represent 165 mg l-1 sub-

It is apparent that the 220 mg l-1 resorcinol substrate is 
the optimal tested concentration of resorcinol for E. 
cloacae  to be consume d as its sole source of carbon and 
energy.  The enzymes used in the degradation pathway 
are able to consume 220 mg l-1 concentration completely, 
whereas a lesser concentration does not provide enough 
carbon and energy source to sustain the E. cloacae  
demands within the observation time.  
 
 
Michaelis -Menten kinetics  
 
The Michaelis -Menten equation was chosen as the enzy -
matic kinetics modeling equation.  Curve -fitting regression 
analysis was allow ed for solution for initial rate (Jonh et 
al., 2009) while the classic method of solving for kinetic 
parameters was to linearize the graphs using reciprocals (Agarry and Solomon, 2008).  To solve the Michaelis -
Menten equation (Eq uation 4) , it was best to plot the data 
according to 1/r vs. 1/S (data in Table 3 ) and obtain a 
straight -line equation (Fig ure 4). The equation was solved 
for the y -intercept, and its  reciprocal is V max. The 
Lineweaver -Burke equation (Eq uation 5) was used to 
ease solving of the model , as previously done by  
Kovarova and Egli (1998) and Chauhan et al . (2010).  
Experimental data and this simple calculation generate d 
all the variables in the Michaelis -Menten equation except 
for K m, which was found.  Vmax was 0.03 mM/min and K m 
was equal to 0.011 moles, empirical averages for r of 
0.00375 mM o f O 2 for s ubstrate utilization/min/mg dry 
weight of cells and for S of 0.00125 moles.  The Michaelis  
- Menten equation finds K m to be the theoretical amount 
of substrate present when velocity was at half of its 
maximum (V max).   
 
 
 
DISCUSSION  
 
The present s tudy reports the b iodegradation growth 
kinetics and steady state enzyme kinetics for resorcinol 
by E. cloacae . Pure culture degradation kinetics of orga -
nic contaminants has been reported in the past by many 
researchers (Bafana et al., 2007).  Although a co nsortium 
was often recognized as beneficial due to the favorable 
synergistic interactions that often result, but in this study 
indigenous E. cloacae  was found to degrade resorcinol.  
Resorcinol degradation differs from other phenolic com -
pounds due to the p osition of the hydroxyls.  Resorcinol 
degradation required  the addition of a hydroxyl transfer 
whereas catechol is easily converted to benzoquinone 
and phenol to catechol (Yao et al. , 2006; Ferreira Guedes 
et al ., 2010).  It is also reported that r esorcinol toxicity, 
despite its dependence on the surrounding environment  
affects  the ability of P. putida  DSM6414 to utilize it easily  
(Ferreira Guedes et al ., 2010).  It is very rare to find 
literature describing an aerobic bacterium that is able to 
use resorcinol as its sole source of carbon and energy; 
however, Penicillium  fungus has been proven to use 
resorcinol (Ferreira Guedes et al ., 2010), and 
Rhodococcus opacus  has anaerobically degraded resor -
cinol in the gut of Macrotermes michaelseni  (Ngugi et al., 
2005).   
The results in Table 2 disp lay the Monod, Michaelis -
Menten  and Monod -Michaelis Menten kinetic analysis of 
different bacterial strains on resorcinol  (up to 220 mg l-1). 
Since Michaelis -Menton is based on the Monod equation, 
this comparison is valid.  The h alf-saturation constant was 
solved when the biomass was kept at a steady no -growth 
constant (Ferreira Guedes et al., 2010).  The higher half -
saturation constant was detected for substrates that are 
more difficult to degrade (Ferreira Guedes et al., 2010).  
The data reported were highly comparable with that 
(11.27 mM) reported by Ferreira Guedes et al . (2010).  
Agarry and Solomon (2008) suggested that the most 
reliable data reporting better physiology of the bacterial 
strain is the rate of substrate degradation . Despite the 
higher Monod constant found for E. cloacae listed in 
Table 2, E. cloacae  degrade d 220 mg l-1 resorcinol 
almost completely in the first 25 h of growth, whereas 
Penicillium chrysogenum  CLONA2 t ook over 80 h to 
degrade approximately the same con centration of 
resorcinol substrate (Ferreira Guedes et al., 2010).  Kim 
et al. (2005) state d that the highest specific growth per 
substrate concentration was another good indicator of 
competitive advantages when comparing bacterial 
strains.  This was depicte d as μ max divided by K S. The 
Monod equation for resorcinol degradation using E. 
cloacae  resulted in a low μ max of 0.0371.  It has been 
reported in the literature that μ max for benzene degrada -
tion using Pseudomonas  aeruginosa , P. fluorescens , and 
P. putida  ranges from 0.30 to 0.62, resulting in a μ max/KS 
ratio in the range of 0.004 to 0.376 (Abuhamed et al ., 
2004;  Kim et  al., 2005).  In comparison, resorcinol degra - Jablonski et al.          3639  
 
 
 
dation by E. cloacae  specific growth per substrate con -
centration outcome was a s low as 0.00168, explaining 
that it is a difficult substrate to be used by bacteri a as a 
sole source of carbon and energy  under aerobic 
condition s. The outcome offer ed a possible reason why 
resorcinol is rarely used in organic compoun d degrada -
tion studies.  
 
 
Conclusions  
 
The performance of the indigenous E. cloacae  in the 
diluted defined minimal media  using 220 mg l-1 resorcinol 
substrate concentration showed aerobic degradation of 
the single limiting substrate.  The K m value observed was 
11.00 mM and μ max value was 0.037 h-1. Concentrations 
of resorcinol substrate lower than 220 mg l-1 proved to be 
insufficient in carbon and energy to allow growth, while 
resorcinol concentrations greater than 220 mg l-1 (550, 
880, 1100 mg l-1) proved i nhibitory for cell growth . The 
present study is believed to be the first publication 
describing aerobic degradation kinetics for resorci nol (a 
photo -oxidizable  compound) using an isolated bacterium  
E. cloacae , from an activated sludge of industrial waste  
water treatment facility.
