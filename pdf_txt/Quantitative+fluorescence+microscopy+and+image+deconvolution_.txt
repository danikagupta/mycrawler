Deconvolution enhances contrast in ﬂuorescence microscopy images, especially in low-contrast, high-
background wide-ﬁeld microscope images, improving characterization of features within the sample. Decon-volution can also be combined with other imaging modalities, such as confocal microscopy, and mostsoftware programs seek to improve resolution as well as contrast. Quantitative image analyses requireinstrument calibration and with deconvolution, necessitate that this process itself preserves the relativequantitative relationships between ﬂuorescence intensities. To ensure that the quantitative nature of the dataremains unaltered, deconvolution algorithms need to be tested thoroughly. This study investigated whetherthe deconvolution algorithms in AutoQuant X3 preserve relative quantitative intensity data. InSpeck Greencalibration microspheres were prepared for imaging, z-stacks were collected using a wide-ﬁeld microscope,and the images were deconvolved using the iterative deconvolution algorithms with default settings.Afterwards, the mean intensities and volumes of microspheres in the original and the deconvolved imageswere measured. Deconvolved data sets showed higher average microsphere intensities and smaller volumesthan the original wide-ﬁeld data sets. In original and deconvolved data sets, intensity means showed linearrelationships with the relative microsphere intensities given by the manufacturer. Importantly, upon normal-ization, the trend lines were found to have similar slopes. In original and deconvolved images, the volumes ofthe microspheres were quite uniform for all relative microsphere intensities. We were able to show thatAutoQuant X3 deconvolution software data are quantitative. In general, the protocol presented can be usedto calibrate any ﬂuorescence microscope or image processing and analysis procedure.

INTRODUCTION
At the primary step of observing and imaging, microscopes
are completely visually oriented. Image processing, how-ever, with the various software programs available, allowsfor the quantification of various aspects of the specimen. Inparticular, fluorescence microscopy has been used to quan-tify the localization, dynamics, and interactions of cellularmolecules.
1–3Also, many techniques enable quantification
of fluorescence intensity: fluorescence recovery after pho-tobleaching, fluorescence loss in photo-bleaching, fluores-cence resonance energy transfer, and fluorescence lifetimeimaging.
1,2,4Such quantification of data allows for the
measurement and scaling of the intensity values so thatchanges indistinguishable by the eye may be measured.Several considerations need to be addressed when per-
forming quantitative analysis. First, illumination stabilityof the light source can be one of the main sources ofvariability.
1,2,5In wide-field microscopes, the output of the
mercury lamps can fluctuate up to 10% on time-scales ofmilliseconds to seconds and becomes more prominent asthe lamp ages.
1,2Another source of noise is the photon shot
noise or the uncertainty in the charge-coupled device(CCD) camera detection of a photon.
1,2The relative con-
tribution of shot noise decreases with increasing photoncounts; hence, to minimize photon shot noise, as manyphotons as possible need to be collected without damagingthe sample.
1,2
With wide-field microscopes, pixels in a large field of
view are imaged simultaneously. The collection of a largeamount of light, including out-of-focus light, results inhigh sensitivity. However, the wide-field images also havereduced contrast as a result of significant background fromthe out-of-focus light. On the other hand, confocal laser-scanning microscopes (CLSMs) illuminate the samplepoint-by-point and remove out-of-focus light by passing

hence, confocal microscopes improve the image con-trast.
1,2In turn, the exclusion of much of the out-of-focus
light leads to lower sensitivity of CLSMs when compared
with wide-field microscopes.
Furthermore, CCD cameras used with wide-field mi-
croscopes have better quantum efficiency—the percent ofphotons that reaches the detector that are converted intophoto electrons or signal within the images—than thephotomultiplier tubes used with CLSMs.
6Consequently,
in situations with little out-of-focus light [e.g., thin speci-
mens (/H1102130/H9262m) or thick specimens with the fluorescence
signal confined to a narrow volume], wide-field imagingproduces “statistically better-defined images” for the sameamount of illumination.
1,2,6Deconvolution can then be
used to improve the contrast in these images to levels
comparable with CLSMs.
When light travels through the microscope, it is dif-
fracted by the optical elements. As a result of diffraction,the light is spread, and subresolution objects appear biggerthan they actually are. The resultant, three-dimensional(3D) distribution of each point of fluorescence within thespecimen is referred to as the point-spread function(PSF).
1,2,7In other words, when the subresolution object is
imaged it is convolved by the optics and looks like a PSF
that is much larger than the original object in the image.1,2
Deconvolution is the process of estimating the mor-
phology of the actual object that gave rise to the blurredimage. There are three major types of deconvolution ap-proaches: deblurring, restorative, and restorative blind de-convolution.
Deblurring or Nearest Neighbor-Based Deconvolution
The deblurring method removes the out-of-focus light inan image with the assumption that most of the out-of-focuslight results from its two “neighbors”: the image axialsection above and the section below. The method worksespecially well with low numerical aperture lenses or rela-tively large section spacings.
1,2As a result of the assump -
tions and simple estimates of the out-of-focus light, how-ever, there are inherent errors with the method, and itshould not be used for quantitative analysis.
1,2However, as
it can be calculated rapidly, deblurring methods can be
used to produce high-contrast images for quickly evaluat-ing sample morphology.
1,2
Restorative Deconvolution
Restorative deconvolution methods use the theoretical ormeasured PSF to try to estimate the actual object thatproduced the image before it was convolved with thePSF.
1,2The PSF can be calculated (theoretical PSF) based
on the optical properties of the microscope (e.g., objectivelens, numerical aperture, sampling frequency, color of
light) or measured using subresolution fluorescent micro-spheres [ /H11011100 nm diameter for high numerical aperture
(NA) objectives]. After an estimation of the object is made,this estimation is convolved with the PSF to generate a newimage, which is compared with the original collected im-age, and the difference between the two images is deter-mined using algorithm-dependent techniques. If the differ-ence between the images is larger than a predeterminedfactor, then the process is repeated until the estimatedimage is not significantly different than the collected im-age. The term iterative is used for this repetition. Anadvantage of restorative deconvolution is that the out-of-focus light is not removed, such as light rejected by thepinhole in confocal imaging, but is rather reassigned to itsoriginal location, yielding images with a much higher sig-nal-to-noise (S/N) ratio than the initial wide-field images.Huygens (Scientific Volume Imaging, The Netherlands)and AutoQuant X3 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD,USA) are examples of commercial software packages thatoffer restorative deconvolution algorithms. DeconvolutionLab is a plug-in that is available for ImageJ or FIJI, but itrequires the user to measure the PSF of their microscope.Deconvolution Lab is more geared to advanced deconvo-lution users but offers a lot of flexibility, with seven differ-ent deconvolution algorithms from which to choose.
8,9In
general, it is best to use a carefully measured PSF for
deconvolution, as it will provide the algorithm with theexact characteristics of the microscope. However, if the PSFis not measured properly, it will introduce errors in theanalysis, and the theoretical PSF would be a better startingpoint for the algorithm. For detailed instructions, on howto prepare subresolution microsphere samples and manu-facture specific protocols on how to measure CLSM PSFs,see Cole et al.
7These protocols can be adapted easily for
measuring wide-field microscope PSFs.
Blind Deconvolution
Blind deconvolution is an extension to restorative de-
convolution. However, in this case, both the object andthe PSF are treated as unknown. The initial PSF estimateis the theoretical function, but then, the PSF is modifiedas part of the deconvolution algorithm, which derivesthe PSF from the actual image data. Afterwards, themorphology of the object is estimated and convolvedwith the derived PSF. In the subsequent iterations, notonly is the object estimation altered but also, the PSFestimate.
10,11AutoQuant X3 (Media Cybernetics) is a
commercial software package that has an optional algo-
rithm for blind deconvolution.LEE ET AL. / QUANTITATIVE WIDE-FIELD DECONVOLUTION
32 JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR TECHNIQUES, VOLUME 25, ISSUE 1, APRIL 2014Aberrations
It should be noted that aberrations as a result of instrument
performance, objective lens quality, and sample prepara-tion have a significant impact on any fluorescence imagingexperiment, including deconvolution analysis. If the mi-croscope stage drifts, the z-focus drifts, or the DIC opticsare in place, the PSF of the microscope or of the imagestacks will not be accurate.
7If objective lenses are not
performing well and show aberrations, such as coma or
astigmatisms, the lenses need to be repaired or replaced. Ifsamples are not prepared properly with the correct cover-slip thickness or if the sample mounting media are notwell-matched with the immersion media, then sphericalaberrations can be a problem. Spherical aberrations causeasymmetric distortions in the PSF, and these aberrationschange and typically become more problematic when im-aging deeper into thick specimens.
12–15They can be min -
imized by matching the indices of refraction of the samplemounting medium and the lens immersion medium as wellas possible. Spherical aberrations are most prominent whenimaging into aqueous samples with oil immersion lenses.Many deconvolution algorithms have correction featuresand/or image preprocessing steps that can minimize spher-ical aberrations. The ideal way to correct for sphericalaberrations is to measure the actual PSF of the microscope
using subresolution fluorescent microspheres.
7In this
study, we looked specifically at microspheres that were in
close proximity to the coverslip and used 0.170 mm-thickcoverslips so spherical aberrations were not an issue (seeSupplemental Fig. 1).
There is a great deal of previous work that has looked at
quantitative deconvolution.
1,2,16However, in this study,
we present a simple and straightforward protocol for testing
whether wide-field microscopes are quantitative and whether de-convolution algorithms maintain that quantitative intensity
relationship in 3D image stacks of fluorescent calibration micro-
spheres. Many researchers use image deconvolution as away to improve measurements of the 3D morphology ofsamples and also to improve image S/N. However, decon-volution is often not a central part of their research. There-fore, we wanted to test the simplest scenario using thedefault parameters of the commercial AutoQuant X3 de-convolution software package and inputting the theoreticalPSF in the algorithm. This is a scenario many people use inthe McGill Advanced BioImaging Facility (ABIF). Itshould be noted that much time could be spent measuringinstrument PSFs and optimizing deconvolution algorithmsettings for more ideal performance, but that was not theaim of this study. For further general and advanced infor-mation on deconvolution, there are many informative be-ginner and advanced articles.

Preparation of the Fluorescent Calibration Microsphere
Slides (As Adapted from Cole et al.7)
1. InSpeck Green calibration microspheres, from 0%
to 100% relative intensity, were vortexed briefly.
2. The microspheres were sonicated in a water bath for
20 min to break up any aggregates.
3. The lab bench tabletop was wiped clean with etha-
nol. Gloves were worn for succeeding steps to avoidfingerprint smudges on the slides and coverslips.
4. Microscope slides were washed with 70% ethanol
and wiped dry with Kimwipes.
5. No. 1.5 coverslips were washed with 70% ethanol
and held with forceps in a Bunsen burner flame, twotimes. Take care, as the glass cracks if flamed for toolong. This creates a hydrophilic surface on the glass,allowing for better spreading of the microspheredroplet. Carrying out the step once often left blotsof dirt on the coverslips; repetition ensured clean,shiny coverslip surfaces. A separate coverslip wasprepared for each relative intensity of calibrationmicrospheres that was used.LEE ET AL. / QUANTITATIVE WIDE-FIELD DECONVOLUTION
JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR TECHNIQUES, VOLUME 25, ISSUE 1, APRIL 2014 336. Right before pipetting the microspheres onto the
coverslips, the microsphere vials were vortexedbriefly.
7. A sample of 10 /H9262l calibration microsphere solution
of each intensity was pipetted onto each coverslip.The coverslips were then covered with a metal panor aluminum foil to protect them from light anddust.
8. Solutions were dried on the coverslips for 1–2 h.9. A small drop of ProLong Gold was applied onto
each microscope slide. ProLong Gold has a refrac-tive index of 1.46, which nearly matches the indicesof refraction of the glass and immersion oil(1.515).
7The similar indices of refraction increase
microscope resolution by decreasing the loss of
highly diffracted light from refraction at the inter-faces of different media.
7
10. Using forceps, the coverslips were placed with the
microspheres facing down onto the ProLong Gold.Coverslips were held at a 45° angle and then re-leased slowly to minimize the formation of air bub-bles. Then, the coverslip was pressed lightly with acotton-tip applicator to force any air bubbles to theedges of the coverslip and out of the sample.
11. Each slide was then flipped over and propped up at
each end with an empty microscope slide placedlengthwise so that the microspheres stayed on thecoverslip.
12. The samples were kept in the dark at room temper-
ature overnight for the ProLong Gold to cure.
Microsphere Imaging
1. The mercury arc lamp and the wide-field micro-
scope were turned on.
2. The power of the mercury lamp (100 W) was ad-
justed to 50% and warmed up for at least 30 min forstabilization of the output intensity. It is best not touse the lamp below 50% intensity, as fluctuations inpower output can occur. Note that not all mercurylamps have this kind of power adjustment.
3. While the lamp was heating up, the 100 /H11003oil im-
mersion 1.4-NA objective lens was cleaned. Anyexcess oil on the lens was removed by folding a pieceof lens paper three times lengthwise into a longrectangle and sweeping it across the lens three times,using a fresh area of the paper with each sweep.
7The
process was repeated two more times: once with lens
cleaner and once with distilled water on the paper.
4. The filter cube was set to FITC 450–490 nm.5. Before proceeding to imaging, the FieldMaxII-
TOP Laser Power/Energy Meter (Coherent) wasused to measure the lamp power directly. The de-tector was placed on the 10 /H11003objective lens and
immobilized using Blu-Tack. A wavelength ( /H9261)o f
470 nm was set, the light in the room was turnedoff, and the power meter was zeroed by pressing on“Zero”. Subsequently, the fluorescent lamp shutterwas opened, and the measurement of the power wasobtained by pressing on “Auto”. Power measure-ments at 0.5% and 5% lamp intensity were ob-tained by placing neutral density (ND) filters of 1%or 10% directly in the light path, respectively. Afterthe measurements were recorded, the power meterdetector was removed from the objective lens.
6. The 100 /H11003/1.40-NA Plan-Apochromat oil immer-
sion lens was put in place, and a small drop ofimmersion oil standardized for room temperaturewas applied.
7. A calibration microsphere slide was placed, cover-
slip facing down, on the objective lens and viewedthrough the eyepieces. After focusing in a region ofsparse microsphere concentration (to allow for sin-gle microsphere intensity measurements), the mi-crospheres were viewed in the software with the liveimaging function.
8. We ensured that the imaging settings were not
resulting in detector saturation. Many softwarepackages have an image display look-up table thatshows pixels reading zero as one color and satu-rated pixels as another color, with all other pixelsshowing up as grayscale. In the Zeiss software, theoverexposure button in the live view was used toverify that the microsphere intensity signal wasnot saturated in the images. The overexposurefeature shows pixels reading zero as blue, satu-rated pixels red, and all other pixels with grayscaleintensities. It is imperative for quantitative fluo-rescence data of the corresponding intensitiesthat the intensities do not exceed the linear rangeof the detection system.
1,2,11To attenuate satu -
ration, ND filters could be put in place, or thepower of the mercury lamp could be adjusteddirectly if the lamp has the capability. For theprotection of the sample and the fluorophores, itis always best to reduce the intensity of the inci-dent light whenever possible. Saturation can alsobe avoided by using shorter camera exposuretimes.
9. A z-stack, with a pixel size in x,y, and zaxes of
0.0645 /H110030.0645 /H110030.3/H9262m, respectively, was
collected. The sampling should adhere to Nyquistsampling or higher for deconvolution. Cole et al.

fied that: (1) significant sampling was obtained fordeconvolution, and (2) the entire microsphere wasimaged within the z-stack.
10.At least three z-stacks were acquired of different
microspheres in different fields of view.
11.Once the z-stack was collected, it was saved as (1)
the original software file format (.zvi) and (2) the16-bit .tif file format with 0% compression.
12.Steps 7–11 were repeated for the microsphere slides
of various relative intensities.
13.All images were taken at a single imaging session to
avoid changes in lamp intensity.
Image Processing
Images were deconvolved using the restorative iterative
deconvolution algorithm with default settings, without orwith the addition of blind deconvolution in AutoQuant X3(Media Cybernetics). Based on our experience in a lifesciences core facility, the majority of users of commercialdeconvolution software does not spend a significantamount of time studying and optimizing deconvolutionsoftware settings. Therefore, all programs were used withthe default settings, unless noted otherwise. Afterwards,Imaris version 7.5.2 or version 7.6.2 (Bitplane, SouthWindsor, CT, USA) was used to measure the mean inten-sity and volume of the microspheres in the original and thedeconvolved images. In Imaris, the surface function wasused to create an isosurface of each of the microspheres.Settings of “Surface area detail level” of 0.5 /H9262m and “back-
ground subtraction with diameter of largest sphere whichfits into the object” of 0.3 /H9262m were used. The surfaces were
generated using the intensity thresholding automaticallydetermined by the software. The Imaris automatic thresh-olding is based on k-means clustering and dividing theimage intensity histogram into two populations using thealgorithm developed by Ridler and Calvard.
19This
method of thresholding is very robust and offers an objec-
tive way to identify the microsphere boundaries withoutany user bias. If necessary, the microsphere selections werefiltered using a minimum voxel threshold to remove smallvolume object artifacts. The voxel thresholding enabled thesame number of microspheres to be measured for thecorresponding image stacks in the wide-field and the de-convolved images so that the same microspheres were ac-counting for the statistics of each image set.
RESULTS
To determine whether the AutoQuant X3 iterative decon-volution algorithm, with or without blind deconvolution,retains the relative quantitative fluorescence intensity in-formation, three sets (Set 1, 2, and 3) of microscope slideswere prepared separately with calibration microspheres of
six different relative intensities of 0.2%, 0.8%, 2.3%,10.6%, 30.0%, and 100%, given by the manufacturer. Atleast three wide-field microscope z-stack images were takenof each microsphere slide in different regions of the sample.For Set 1, all microspheres were imaged using 0.5% powerand 120 ms exposure time. For Set 2, all microspheres wereimaged using 0.5% power and 80 ms exposure time. ForSet 3, the mercury bulb power was low, and the micro-spheres of lower intensities (0.2% and 0.8%) were not
visible at 0.5% mercury lamp power. Consequently,
0.2%, 0.8%, and 2.3% microspheres were imaged with 5%power, and 10.6%, 30.0%, and 100% microspheres wereimaged with 0.5% power. The exposure time of 80 ms wasused for all microsphere slides in Set 3. The exposure timesand measured lamp powers were used to scale the micro-sphere intensities so they could be compared between datasets. All z-stacks were deconvolved using the iterative de-convolution algorithm, with or without blind deconvolu-tion, using the default settings in AutoQuant X3 (Fig. 1).One sample of 0% microsphere intensity (i.e. unlabelledmicrospheres) was prepared and no fluorescence signal wasobserved. As expected, following blind deconvolution,there was improved image contrast and decreased out-of-focus blur (compare Fig. 1A with B). This is especiallyprominent in the xz-axis and yz-axis views with the disap-
pearance of the emanating cones of out-of-focus light(compare Fig. 1C with D). Note that there is some asym-metry in the profile of these microspheres (see yzandzy
profiles in Fig. 1C). This could be a result of (1) a slightdefect in the objective lens, leading to a coma artifact(Supplemental Fig. 1); (2) indices of refraction differencesbetween the immersion oil and the ProLong Gold; or (3)lensing effects that can be seen with these large micro-spheres. Blind deconvolution reassigns the out-of-focuslight to its original location; therefore, the intensities of themicrospheres increase significantly, as evident when thesame intensity display scale is applied on the original wide-field and blind deconvolution images (Fig. 2) Note that themicrospheres are barely visible (Fig. 2A) on the same inten-sity scale as the high-intensity blind deconvolution images(Fig. 2B).
Subsequently, Imaris 3D image analysis software was
used to measure the mean intensity and volume of themicrospheres in the original and the deconvolved images.The quantitative data for multiple image stacks at relativemicrosphere intensities were then averaged for the originalwide-field data, the iterative deconvolved data, and theiterative blind deconvolved data.
As the deconvolution algorithms reassign the out-of-
focus light to its origin, higher S/N ratios are seen. Thus,the following expected observations were made:LEE ET AL. / QUANTITATIVE WIDE-FIELD DECONVOLUTION
JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR TECHNIQUES, VOLUME 25, ISSUE 1, APRIL 2014 351. The deconvolved microspheres have fivefold higher
average intensities than the wide-field microspheresfor all microsphere intensities (Table 1 and Fig. 3A).
2. The deconvolved microspheres have /H1101170% lower
volumes than the wide-field microspheres for allmicrosphere intensities as a result of increased con-trast and the fact that the deconvolution algorithmminimizes the distortion of microsphere within theimage and the spreading of light caused by diffrac-tion (Table 1 and Fig. 3C).
Quantitative Intensity Information
The data from the images taken at 5% mercury lamp
power were adjusted to the 0.5% power by multiplying
the measured power ratio of the mercury bulb power at0.5% (0.0535 mW) and 5% power (0.6460 mW), whichis 0.0828, to each intensity measurement derived fromImaris. Then, the relative average intensity of the cali-bration microspheres in the wide-field and the decon-volved images were graphed against the actual micro-sphere intensities from the manufacturer. Subsequently,
a linear line of regression was fit to the scatter plots to seeif the relationship between the defined relative micro-sphere intensity and the measured mean intensityshowed the expected linear relationship (Fig. 3A).
Intensity means of microspheres from original and
deconvolved images showed linear correlation, with therelative microsphere intensities from the manufacturer’sspecifications (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). The intensity datafrom the 100% intensity microspheres were consistentlylower than expected, by /H1101120%, compared with the other
microspheres in the original images. This is likely a result ofsome dye self-quenching with the high concentration ofdye in the 100% intensity microspheres. Hence, furtheranalyses were carried out with just the five calibrationmicrospheres of lower intensities: 0.2%, 0.8%, 2.3%,10.6%, and 30.0%.
The mean intensity of each calibration microsphere
was normalized by first dividing by the maximum intensity

microspheres) for a specific experimental run and thenaveraging all of the microsphere intensities. When thenormalized intensity means were graphed against the actualmicrosphere intensities, all three experimental data sets(Sets 1, 2, and 3) yielded trend lines with slopes of /H110110.03
and coefficient of determination ( R
2) values of /H110220.98—
before and after deconvolution. As the slopes of the graphs
reflect the quantitative relationship between various fluo-rescence intensities, the similar magnitudes in-slope for theoriginal images and the deconvolved images clearly indicatethat deconvolution using the AutoQuant X3 blind decon-volution algorithm preserves the relative quantitative in-tensity data (Fig. 3B).
Data from all three experiments were combined for
original data, iterative deconvolution data, and iterativeblind deconvolution data. All data sets resulted in lineartrend lines with similar slopes (0.0331, 0.0327, and0.0333, respectively) and high R
2values (0.9869, 0.9911,
and 0.9905, respectively; Fig. 3B). There was no significant
difference between the iterative deconvolution and theiterative blind deconvolution. This is not surprising, as thePSF for these images is very close to the theoretical (Sup-plemental Fig. 1), and images were collected of micro-spheres near the coverslip in a thin sample. Blind deconvo-lution is particularly useful when imaging deep intosamples when it is difficult to have an accurately measuredPSF and when spherical aberrations can be significant.
Volume
The volumes of the calibration microspheres in the originalwide-field images and the deconvolved images were deter-mined using the Imaris software. As expected, for all threeexperiments, the average volumes are consistent across the
microspheres of different fluorescence intensities for theoriginal wide-field and deconvolved images (Table 1 andFig. 3C). Deconvolution did decrease the average volumefrom 19 /H110062t o1 3 /H110062/H9262m
3, as a result of increased
contrast and the reassignment of out-of-focus light toward
the center of the microspheres, which restores microsphereshape. The deconvolved microsphere image volume of 13/H9262m
3is approaching the expected volume of 8 /H9262m3, based
on the sphere diameter of 2.5 /H9262m. The microspheres do
not appear spherical as a result of diffraction along thez-axis. In fact, they are distorted and oblong along the
z-axis. Therefore, the microsphere volume measurements
are expected to be larger than the actual microsphere size.Deconvolution does improve the z-axis resolution but does
not completely correct the microsphere distortion, so vol-ume measurements are still much larger than expected.There was no significant difference in the measured micro-TABLE 1

iterative blind deconvolution data (Table 1 and Fig 3C).
We attempted to repeat our analysis using Huygens
Essential deconvolution software. When using the defaultsettings in the software and a theoretical PSF, we foundmicrospheres to be very symmetric and less oblong alongthez-axis than the original or the AutoQuant X3 deconvo-
lution data (average volume of 10 /H110062). However, the inten-
sity data did not maintain a linear relationship. We areconvinced that this is a file-formatting/scaling-factor issuecausing a distortion of the intensity information, but wewere unable to correct this using the Huygens Essentialsoftware. Thus, the Huygens software can likely give quan-titative intensity data but not using the default settings andfile formats available with Huygens Essential. HuygensProfessional would likely yield quantitative data but re-quires more advanced deconvolution training, and usersneed to spend considerable time setting up and optimizingthe deconvolution algorithm settings and learn how toadjust the scaling factor during file-format conversions.
DISCUSSION
In this study, our aims were to calibrate our wide-fieldmicroscope and determine whether the AutoQuant X3restorative deconvolution algorithms retained quantitativeintensity information. Data collected using calibration mi-crospheres supported that our wide-field microscope isquantitative, and they did indeed show a linear response tothe different intensity microspheres (Fig. 3A and B). Fol-lowing deconvolution, this linear response is not onlymaintained but also shows similar magnitudes in-slopeupon normalization (Fig. 3A and B). As the slope of theplots reflect a change in the quantitative relationship betweenvarious fluorescence intensities, the similar magnitudes in-slope clearly indicate that deconvolution preserves the relativerelationship between fluorescence intensities. The robustnessof the calibration yielded the wide-field and deconvolutiongraphs of the intensity means against the actual microsphereintensities, with slopes of /H110110.03 and R
2values of /H110220.985,
before and after deconvolution (Fig. 3B).
As a result of deconvolution algorithms reassigning the
out-of-focus light to their origin, higher S/N images areseen following deconvolution, and the microspheres havehigher intensity means and much rounder shapes (Figs. 1and 2). As a result, the deconvolved microspheres havelower volumes than the wide-field image microspheres(Table 1 and Fig. 3C). Deconvolution decreased the mea-sured volume to 70% of the original image volumes, whichis much closer to the expected volume of 8 /H9262m
3, based on
the actual microsphere size.
It should be noted that in our hands, the 100% inten-
sity microspheres had lower average intensity means andsums than expected, and they were eliminated from further
analysis. This may be caused by the phenomenon of con-centration quenching that causes highly concentrated fluo-rophores to have lower intensities than expected as a resultof the intermolecular quenching between nearby fluoro-phores.

It is imperative for any quantitative imaging experi-
ments to test and validate that the equipment is generatingquantitative data. It is also important to validate that anyimage processing or analysis steps applied to the data main-tain quantitative intensity information. Overall, we havepresented a protocol for calibration microsphere samplepreparation, imaging, and analysis. This protocol should beuseful to others for calibrating instruments for quantitativeimaging and ensuring instrument quality control. In addi-tion, we have demonstrated that the iterative deconvolu-tion and iterative blind deconvolution algorithms in Auto-Quant X3 maintain the linear relationship in calibratedmicrosphere intensities and more importantly, their rela-tive intensity changes. We are now confident that the use ofAutoQuant X3 is appropriate and accurate for quantitativefluorescence imaging.
