Abstract: Acrylic manufacturing wastewater is characterized by high toxicity, poor biodegradability,
high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen. Herein, we exploited traditional
Fenton technology to treat acrylic Ô¨Åber manufacturing wastewater. The impacts of key operating
variables including the initial concentration of H 2O2(CH2O2 ), the initial concentration of Fe2+(DFe2+),
and solution pH (pH) on the COD removal rate (R COD) were explored and the treatment process
was optimized by Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The results indicated that the optimum
parameters are determined as pH 3.0, 7.44 mmol/L of Fe2+and 60.90 mmol/L of H 2O2during Fenton
process. For the actual acrylic manufacturing wastewater treatment shows that the removal rates for
COD, TOC, NH 4+-N and TN are 61.45%~66.51%, 67.82%~70.99%, 55.67%~60.97% and 56.45%~61.03%,
respectively. It can meet the textile dyeing and Ô¨Ånishing industry water pollutant discharge standard
(GB4287-2012). During the Fenton reaction, the effective degradation and removal of organic matter
is mainly achieved by HO oxidation, supplemented by Ô¨Çocculation and sedimentation of Fe3+
complexes. This study will provide useful implications in the process parameters for the practical
application of Fenton method in acrylic acid production wastewater.

1. Introduction
Acrylic Ô¨Åbers are one kinds of the signiÔ¨Åcant manufacturing raw materials for the
textile industry [ 1]. During the manufacture of acrylic Ô¨Åbers, a large volume of wastewater
is inevitably generated. Owing to its high toxicity, poor biodegradability, high COD, and
ammonia nitrogen, acrylic Ô¨Åber manufacturing wastewater has been recognized as one of
the problematic organic wastewaters [ 2]. In general, conventional biological methods have
been used in the degradation of organic matters in acrylic Ô¨Åber manufacturing wastewater.
However, the efÔ¨Çuent water quality treated by conventional biological processes such as
A/O and A2/O alone usually cannot meet the national discharge standards [ 3]. Therefore,
it is imperative to develop stable, effective, economical combined processes to treat acrylic
manufacturing wastewater.
At present, the main approaches for the treatment of acrylic Ô¨Åber manufacturing
wastewater include but not limit to bio-enhanced treatment [ 4,5], membrane technol-
ogy [ 6,7], advanced oxidation processes (AOP) [ 8,9], and coupled treatment processes [ 10].
C. Gong et al. [ 11] used an electro-coagulation (EC) process to pretreat acrylic Ô¨Åber manu-
facturing wastewater. Under optimal conditions, the removal rate of total organic carbon
was 44%, and the (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) BOD 5/COD ratio was increased to 0.35.
J. Wei et al. [ 12] combined Fenton-sequencing batch membrane bioreactor process for the
treatment of acrylic Ô¨Åber manufacturing wastewater. After Fenton oxidation treatment,
the COD removal rate was 47.0%, and the ratio of BOD 5/COD increased from 0.35 to

0.69. Microbubble-ozonation was used to treat refractory wet-spun acrylic Ô¨Åber manufac-
turing wastewater with 42%, 21%, and 42% removal rates of COD, NH 3-N, and UV 254,
respectively [ 13]. The degradation of refractory organics such as alkane aromatic com-
pounds in wastewater was enhanced by microbubble ozone treatment, which resulted in
improved biodegradability of the wastewater. J. Wei et al. [ 14] utilized the Fered-Fenton
process to treat acrylic Ô¨Åber manufacturing wastewater, resulting in an increase in the
BOD 5/COD ratio from 0.29 to over 0.68 after 180 min of treatment in which Ti was used as
the cathode and RuO 2/Ti as the anode. T. Zheng et al. [ 15] fabricated a three-dimensional
electrochemical oxidation reactor to treat wet-spun acrylic Ô¨Åber manufacturing wastewater,
which signiÔ¨Åcantly elevated the treatment efÔ¨Åciency of COD, NH 3-N, TOC, and UV 254
by 44.5%, 38.8%, 27.2%, and 10.9%, respectively. X. Xu and Z. Shao et al. [ 16] developed
highly efÔ¨Åcient peroxy monosulfate activated catalysts (e.g., LaSrCo 0.8Fe0.2O4) that showed
excellent performance in catalytic advanced oxidation applications of difÔ¨Åcult to degrade
organic pollutants. In terms of this, the enhanced pretreatment of acrylic Ô¨Åber wastewater
using advanced oxidation processes can achieve satisfactory treatment results.
Fenton advanced oxidation process, which is based on the generation of hydroxyl
radicals (HO), has the advantages of high oxidation and strong electron afÔ¨Ånity [ 17].
The Fenton process can decompose refractory organic matter, and its by-product, Fe3+,
have a favorable Ô¨Çocculation effect, which can simultaneously complete the degradation-
coagulation-precipitation removal of organic matter. Therefore, the Fenton method is
considered an effective method for treating refractory organic wastewater [ 18]. However,
there are many intermediate products and side reactions in the Fenton reaction system.
Once the reaction conditions are not adequately controlled, the utilization rate of H 2O2
will decrease, resulting in insufÔ¨Åcient mineralization of organic matter and a severe waste
of raw materials [ 19]. Therefore, during the application of the Fenton method, the use
of reagents, the conversion trend of H 2O2, and the inÔ¨Çuence of operating parameters
on the reaction system should be investigated to achieve the efÔ¨Åcient utilization of the
Fenton process and the economic degradation of pollutants. As mentioned above, this
study adopts the response surface methodology to explore the effect of factors such as
the concentration of H 2O2, the amount of Fe2+added, and the initial pH value on the
degradation of organic matter. In addition, we discussed the interaction between various
factors, the removal effect of refractory organic matter, and the mechanism of the reaction
process. This research provides technical reference and a theoretical basis for applying
the Fenton catalytic oxidation method in the treatment of acrylic Ô¨Åber manufacturing
wastewater.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Wastewater
The experimental acrylic Ô¨Åber wastewater was obtained from the efÔ¨Çuent of the
secondary sedimentation tank after A/O process treatment in a sewage treatment plant in
Jilin Province. The experimental wastewater was pretreated with concentrated sulfuric acid
within 12 h after sampling. The main purpose of pretreatment of acrylic acid wastewater
with concentrated sulfuric acid was to lower the pH of the solution to about 2. The storage
time of acrylic wastewater was prolonged by lowering the pH of the water sample to slow
down the microbial activity and inhibit the hydrolysis of ammonia-containing compounds.
It is worth noting that the water samples must be used within 48 h. The physical and
chemical indicators of wastewater are shown in Table 1.

2.2. Chemicals
All chemicals are of analytical grade. NaOH and H 2SO4(98%) were purchased from
Beijing Chemical Reagent Co., Beijing, China. FeSO 47H2O and H 2O2(30%) were purchased
from Beijing Lanyi Chemical Co., Beijing, China.
2.3. Experimental Method
Since the degradation efÔ¨Åciency of COD by Fenton process was usually affected by
the initial pH of the solution, the H 2O2/FeSO 4ratio, the concentration of H 2O2, FeSO 4,
reaction time, and temperature [ 20,21]. The initial concentrations of Fe2+and H 2O2as well
as the pH determined the amount of HO production in the Fenton reaction, which was
the active substance for the direct oxidation of COD [ 2,22‚Äì24]. The initial concentration of
H2O2(code A), the initial concentration of Fe2+(code B), and the pH value (code C) was
chosen as the primary factors. Firstly, single-factor experiments were conducted to explore
the effect of COD degradation under different conditions. After that, response surface
methodology was adopted to optimize conditions and analyze the interaction between
factors to optimize the Fenton process. Taking the removal rate of COD as the response
value, a three-factor and three-level Box-Behnken response surface design was carried out.
The experimental factors, level codes, design schemes, and response values are shown in
Table 2.

The experimental setup and procedure are shown in Figure 1. Firstly, 300.0 mL of
acrylic Ô¨Åber wastewater was added to the 500.0 mL beaker. The pH adjustment was
achieved by titrating 0.1 or 1 mol/L of H 2SO4(or NaOH) solution under the condition
of stirring intensity around 140 rpm. In which the pH of the solution was monitored by
(LEICI PHB-4) portable pH meter to achieve precise regulation of the solution pH. Secondly,
FeSO 47H2O was added to the solution and stirred at 140.0 rpm. In addition, H 2O2(30% in
mass fraction) was added to the solution to initiate the Fenton oxidation reaction. Finally,
samples were taken at intervals to test the concentrations of Fe2+, COD, and H 2O2.Water 2022 ,14, 2913 4 of 16

Figure 2. Influence of initial concentration of H 2O2 on COD removal rate ( a), the residual concentra-
tion of Fe2+ (b), and the residual concentration of H 2O2 (c). 
As shown in Figure 2a, the COD removal efficiency increased from 41.03% to 62.39% 
as the initial concentration of H 2O2 increased from 18.75 to 75.00 mmol/L. However, when 
the initial concentration of H 2O2 increased to 93.75 mmol/L, the COD removal rate de-
creased slightly. The reason is that the increased H 2O2 concentration can accelerate the 
reaction between H 2O2 and Fe2+, leading to the generati on of more HO‚Ä¢ in the solution, 
thereby improving the COD removal rate. However, excess H 2O2 will be quenched by 
HO‚Ä¢, causing the consumption of the HO‚Ä¢ and the production of hydrogen peroxide rad-
icals (HOO‚Ä¢)  Equation  (1) [32]. Simultaneously, the excess H 2O2 will be self -decomposed 
to produce H 2O and O 2, reducing the utilization  rate Equation  (2).

H2O2 + HO‚Ä¢  ‚Üí HOO‚Ä¢  + H 2O (2) 
The higher the concentration of H 2O2 is, the lower the residual concentration of Fe2+ 
will be (Figure 2b). This trend was attributed to the increased H 2O2 concentration promot-
ing the conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+. Notably, it can be observed that when the H 2O2 concen-
tration was added to 93.75 mmol/L, the residual amount of H 2O2 in the solutio n at 30 min 
was 71.13 mg/L  (or 2.09 mmol/L ) (Figure 2c). This can be ascribed to the that the low Fe2+ 
concentration is hard to trigger the H 2O2 reaction [33]. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
the initial concentration of H 2O2 was not as high as possible, and the best initial concen-
tration is 75.00 mmol/L.  
3.1.2. The Initial Concentration of Fe2+ 
As shown in Figure 3a, the effect of Fe2+ concentration on the removal rate of COD at 
pH 3.0 and H 2O2 concentration of 75 mmol/L. Figure 3b ,c shows the changes of Fe2+ and 
H2O2 concentrations in the aqueous solution after the reaction.  
Figure 2. InÔ¨Çuence of initial concentration of H 2O2on COD removal rate ( a), the residual concentra-
tion of Fe2+(b), and the residual concentration of H 2O2(c).
As shown in Figure 2a, the COD removal efÔ¨Åciency increased from 41.03% to 62.39% as
the initial concentration of H 2O2increased from 18.75 to 75.00 mmol/L. However, when the
initial concentration of H 2O2increased to 93.75 mmol/L, the COD removal rate decreased
slightly. The reason is that the increased H 2O2concentration can accelerate the reaction
between H 2O2and Fe2+, leading to the generation of more HO in the solution, thereby
improving the COD removal rate. However, excess H 2O2will be quenched by HO ,
causing the consumption of the HO and the production of hydrogen peroxide radicals
(HOO) Equation (1) [ 32]. Simultaneously, the excess H 2O2will be self-decomposed to
produce H 2O and O 2, reducing the utilization rate Equation (2).

The higher the concentration of H 2O2is, the lower the residual concentration of
Fe2+will be (Figure 2b). This trend was attributed to the increased H 2O2concentration
promoting the conversion of Fe2+to Fe3+. Notably, it can be observed that when the H 2O2
concentration was added to 93.75 mmol/L, the residual amount of H 2O2in the solution
at 30 min was 71.13 mg/L (or 2.09 mmol/L) (Figure 2c). This can be ascribed to the that
the low Fe2+concentration is hard to trigger the H 2O2reaction [ 33]. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the initial concentration of H 2O2was not as high as possible, and the best
initial concentration is 75.00 mmol/L.
3.1.2. The Initial Concentration of Fe2+
As shown in Figure 3a, the effect of Fe2+concentration on the removal rate of COD at
pH 3.0 and H 2O2concentration of 75 mmol/L. Figure 3b,c shows the changes of Fe2+and

Figure 3. Influence of initial concentration of Fe2+ on COD removal rate ( a), the residual concentra-
tion of Fe2+ (b), and the residual concentration of H 2O2 (c). 
As shown in Figure 3a, with the increase of initial concentration of Fe2+, the COD 
removal rate was increased gradually. The COD removal rate increased significantly from 51% to 65% when the initial concentration of Fe
2+ increased from 2.50 mmol/L to 6.25 
mmol/L. It can be observed that when the initial concentration of Fe2+ increases to 9.38 
mmol/L, the COD removal rate decreases slight ly. The trend of changes in the concentra-
tion of Fe2+ and H 2O2 after the Fenton reaction was shown in Figure 3b,c. Within the reac-
tion time of 0~5 min (Figure 3b), it was clearly observed that the Fe2+ concentration de-
creased rapidly, and then the curve graduall y stabilizes. By comparing the slope of the 
reaction curve, it can be proved that the increased Fe2+ concentration can facilitate the re-
action rate. Furthermore, the consumption rate of H 2O2 increased with the increase of + the 
initial concentration of Fe2 (Figure 3c). Typically, at a low initial concentration of Fe2+, the 
rate of the reaction Equation (1) was slow and the amount of HO‚Ä¢ produced was less than sufficient to oxidize the organic matter in water [17]. Meanwhile, the excess H
2O2 reacted 
with the generated HO‚Ä¢ Equati on (2), which consumes H 2O2 in the water that had not 
been catalytically decomposed, resulting in  a lower COD removal rate[34]. However, 
when the initial concentration of Fe2+ was too high, too much HO‚Ä¢ was produced at the 
beginning of the reaction. At the same time, a side reaction Equation (3) occurred, con-suming HO‚Ä¢ that had not yet participated in the oxidation reaction [35]. In addition, a 
large amount of HO‚Ä¢ would react with each other to form H
2O and O 2 Equation (4) [35], 
which leaded to a decrease in COD removal rate. At a dose of 6.25 mmol/L of Fe2+, the 
H2O2 reacted completely within 30 min and th e best COD removal was achieved. There-
fore, the optimal initial concentration of Fe2+ was 6.25 mmol/L.

3.1.3. Initial pH 
The effect of initial pH on the COD removal rate of acrylic fiber wastewater is shown 
in Figure 4a. The change curve of the concentration of Fe2+ and H 2O2 after the oxidation-
reduction reaction is shown in Figure 4b,c. the initial concentration of Fe2+ was 6.25 
mmol/L, and the initial concentration of H 2O2 was 75 mmol/L. 
Figure 3. InÔ¨Çuence of initial concentration of Fe2+on COD removal rate ( a), the residual concentration
of Fe2+(b), and the residual concentration of H 2O2(c).
As shown in Figure 3a, with the increase of initial concentration of Fe2+, the COD
removal rate was increased gradually. The COD removal rate increased signiÔ¨Åcantly
from 51% to 65% when the initial concentration of Fe2+increased from 2.50 mmol/L to
6.25 mmol/L. It can be observed that when the initial concentration of Fe2+increases
to 9.38 mmol/L, the COD removal rate decreases slightly. The trend of changes in the
concentration of Fe2+and H 2O2after the Fenton reaction was shown in Figure 3b,c. Within
the reaction time of 0~5 min (Figure 3b), it was clearly observed that the Fe2+concentration
decreased rapidly, and then the curve gradually stabilizes. By comparing the slope of the
reaction curve, it can be proved that the increased Fe2+concentration can facilitate the
reaction rate. Furthermore, the consumption rate of H 2O2increased with the increase of
+the initial concentration of Fe2(Figure 3c). Typically, at a low initial concentration of
Fe2+, the rate of the reaction Equation (1) was slow and the amount of HO produced
was less than sufÔ¨Åcient to oxidize the organic matter in water [ 17]. Meanwhile, the excess
H2O2reacted with the generated HO Equation (2), which consumes H 2O2in the water
that had not been catalytically decomposed, resulting in a lower COD removal rate [ 34].
However, when the initial concentration of Fe2+was too high, too much HO was produced
at the beginning of the reaction. At the same time, a side reaction Equation (3) occurred,
consuming HOthat had not yet participated in the oxidation reaction [ 35]. In addition, a
large amount of HO would react with each other to form H 2O and O 2Equation (4) [ 35],
which leaded to a decrease in COD removal rate. At a dose of 6.25 mmol/L of Fe2+, the
H2O2reacted completely within 30 min and the best COD removal was achieved. Therefore,
the optimal initial concentration of Fe2+was 6.25 mmol/L.

tration of H 2O2 (c). 
The results presented in Figure 4a showed that it can be obtained the highest COD 
removal rate of 65.79% at a pH of 3.0, then the removal rate decreased slightly as the pH 
increased. According to the reaction mechanism of the Fenton reagent, the initial pH could 
directly interfere the complex equilibrium  system of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the solution, thereby 
affecting the oxidation ability of the Fenton reagent. As exhibited in Figure 4b ,c, when the 
pH value was 2, the concentration of Fe2+ in the solution was relatively low while the con-
centration of H 2O2 was relatively high within 30 min before the reaction. Due to the higher 
concentration of [H+], the reaction Equation  (5) was in a reverse reaction state. Fe3+ reduc-
tion to Fe2+ was inhibited in this state, and the catalytic reaction could not proceed 
smoothly  [36]. As a result, the generation rate of HO‚Ä¢  was slowed down, and the oxida-
tion capacity was reduced. When the pH value was > 3, it was obvious that the remova l 
rate of COD gradually decrease d, mainly due to the increase of OH- concentration, which 
leads to the decrease of reaction rate Equation  (1), and thus the amount of HO‚Ä¢ decreases.  
As shown in Figure 4b ,c, most of the Fe2+ and H 2O2 in the system reacted quickly and were 
consumed during the first 10 min.  When the reaction time was between 10 and 30 min, 
the Fe2+ concentration gradually decreased and tended to be stable.  When the pH was 2, 
4, and 5, the concentration of H 2O2 did not s tabilize until 90 min.  Notably, the highest 
utilization and reaction rate of H 2O2 was achieved at pH 3, and the reaction equilibrium 
could be reached within 30 min.  Therefore, the optimal pH value of this study was 3.0, 
which was consistent with the result s of other research .

3.2.1. Regression Model and Analysis of Variance  
The results of the RSM model were presented in Table 3, giving the analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA). It should be noted that the F value (Fisher variation ratio) and p value 
(probability value) in the analysis of the variance table were the leading indicators,  show-
ing the significance and adequacy of the model used. p value less than 0.05 means that the 
model was significant, while a value greater than 0.10 was usually regarded as a less crit-
ical factor [37]. The ANO VA of this model showed that the F value of lack of fit was 99.01, 
and the very low p value of lack of fit was 0.0003 (<0.05), indicating that these parameters 
in the model were highly significant. The F value of the regression model was 14.49, and 
p < 0.05, which also proved that the regression model was highly significant,  and the ex-
periment was reliable. As can be seen from Table 3, the R -Squared (R2) and Adjusted R -
Squared (Raj2) of the model , respectively , were 0.95 and 0.89, indicating that the regres sion 
equation was highly reliable, which can explain 89% of the response value changes. Since 
p value was less than 0.05, A, B, B2, C2 can be regarded as vital terms. In addition, it was 
clear that C, A  √ó B, and A  √ó C were considered irrelevant terms. Ther efore, the author

The above regression equation can be used to predict the R-value within the range
of the factors in this study. The value and sign of the regression coefÔ¨Åcient indicated the
inÔ¨Çuence of each item on the response. It can be seen from Equation (6) that the item with
the highest regression coefÔ¨Åcient in the interaction term was B*C, which indicated that
the interaction term occupies a dominant position in the overall response. The positive
sign of the coefÔ¨Åcient indicated a synergistic effect, and the negative sign indicated an
antagonistic effect.
3.2.2. Response Surface Optimization
According to Table 2, the pvalue of AB, AC, and BC were 0.831, 0.533, and
0.0623, respectively. To further determine the interaction between variables, the model
Equation (1) was used for Ô¨Åtting, and the result was shown in Figure 5. It was clear that the
removal rate of COD increased from 29.20% to 59.30% with the changes of A and B, when
the pH was 3 (code value was 0). A view of Figure 5a,d, at the position of the center point,
the range of A was near the  0.61 level and the range of B was near the 0.25 level. From
Figure 5b,e, at the position of the center point, the range of A was near the  0.65 level and
the range of pH was near the 0.10 level. As described in Figure 5c,f, at the position of the
center point, the range of B was near the 0.25 level and the range of C was near the 0.1 level.
The larger the difference between the coded value of the Center Point and the 0.00 level,
the greater the interaction between the two factors [ 38]. As explained previously, the order
of the inÔ¨Çuence of each variable on COD degradation was: A-[H 2O2] > B-[Fe2+] > C-pH.
In addition, it was apparent that the interaction between B-[Fe2+] and C-pH had a more
substantial impact.Water 2022 ,14, 2913 9 of 16

3.2.3. Verification of Optimal COD Degradation Conditions 
As shown in Figure 6, after linear fitting between the predicted and actual values, the 
R2 was 0.95, which showed that the predicted result had a high degree of credibility [39]. 
With the use of the Fenton process to degrade COD in acrylic fiber wastewater, and 
through response surface optimization analysis, the optimal degradation conditions were: 
(i)the initial concentration of H 2O2 was 60.30 mmol/L; (ii) the initial concentration of Fe2+ 
was 7.46 mmol/L; (iii) the pH was 3; (iv) CO D removal rate was 59.22%. The experiment 
was repeated three times under the above-opti mized conditions, and the results were pre-
sented in Table 4. Obviously, it can be obse rved that after treatment, the acrylic fiber 
wastewater effluent can meet the secondary discharge requirements of the ‚ÄúIntegrated Wastewater Discharge Standard‚Äù (GB4287-2012)[ 40].). The COD removal rate‚Äôs actual and 
predicted values were 63.2% and 59.8%, and the error was less than 5%. Therefore, the 
confidence of the obtained model was strong.

3.3. Removal Effect of Refractory Organic Matter
In order to evaluate the degradation effect of toxic and difÔ¨Åcult-to-degrade organic
pollutants in acrylic Ô¨Åber wastewater, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
was used to detect toxic and hazardous substances in the wastewater. Based on the opti-
mal process conditions (The initial concentration of H 2O2was 60.30 mmol/L, the initial
concentration of Fe2+was 7.46 mmol/L, the pH was 3), the actual acrylic manufacturing
wastewater was treated by the Fenton method. The results were presented in Figure 7. It
was evident that the chromatographic peaks of most organics in the water after Fenton
treatment were weakened. Moreover, the raw water contained 16 primary organic pollu-
tants, mainly including aromatic hydrocarbons and long-chain alkanes. It can be seen that
the concentration of organic pollutants had been signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced after the Fenton
process, demonstrating that the Fenton process can convert refractory organic matter into
small molecular organics or inorganics [ 41]. In addition, as shown in Table 5, Undecane,
Diisobutyl phthalate and Dibutyl phthalate still existed in the efÔ¨Çuent. We speculated
that Undecane might be the Ô¨Ånal product of the degradation of long-chain alkanes. In the
Fenton oxidation process, HO preferentially oxidized small molecular organic compounds,
followed by other large molecular organic compounds [ 42]. Since Diisobutyl phthalate and
Dibutyl phthalate were macromolecular organic compounds, and the concentration in the
inÔ¨Çuent was relatively high. As a result, Diisobutyl phthalate and Dibutyl phthalate in
the efÔ¨Çuent was not wholly removed. Notably, the Fenton process can remove most of the
refractory organic matter in acrylic Ô¨Åber wastewater.

3.4. Mechanism Analysis
In brief, the degradation of acrylic Ô¨Åber wastewater by the Fenton process was based
on the HO, which can degrade organic pollutants through oxidation, generated during
the electron transfer process between H 2O2and a homogeneous metal catalyst (Fe2+) [43].
Equations (1)‚Äì(5), (7)‚Äì(9) described the essential reactions in the Fenton process [ 2,44‚Äì47].
The production of HO represented the beginning of the process, which the interaction ofWater 2022 ,14, 2913 12 of 16
Fe2+with H 2O2Equation (1). Meanwhile, the generated Fe3+, which were reduced to Fe2+
by H 2O2, undergo a Fenton-like reaction Equation (5). When there were too many Fe2+, it
would react with HO to produce Fe3+Equation (3). Therefore, Equations (1) and (3) were
the primary sources of Fe3+. Excessive H 2O2reacted with HOto generate HOO, which
oxidation activity was lower than HO .
A large amount of HOO was consumed through reacting with Fe3+, Fe2+, and HO
Equations (7)‚Äì(9), enabling an effective cyclic mechanism of Fe3+and Fe2+.
Fe3++ HOO! Fe2++ H++ O 2 (7)
Fe2++ HOO! Fe3++ HO 2 (8)
HOO+ HO! H2O + O 2 (9)
In addition, a great deal of HO , which had high oxidation, was produced through
the above reaction. In order to demonstrate that the degradation of acrylic acid wastewater
is based on the oxidation of HO , HOscavenging experiments based on the degradation
of acrylic acid wastewater by Fenton system were carried out. It has been shown that
isopropyl alcohol reacts rapidly with HO- and competes with the target substrate, thus
effectively inhibiting the reaction of the target substrate with HO [48]. Therefore, in this
experiment isopropyl alcohol (IPA) was used to remove the active species associated with
the degradation of organic matter. Figure 8 shows the effect of using different concentrations
(0%, 2%, 6%, 10%) of isopropanol on the degradation of organic matter in acrylic acid
wastewater based on the optimal fenton process conditions (mentioned in Section 3.2.3).
As can be seen from Figure 8, the inhibition effect of isopropanol is obvious, with 2%,
6%, and 10% isopropanol almost completely inhibiting the degradation of organics. It
indicates that HO is the main active species in this Fenton system for the degradation of
organic matter. Therefore, the mechanism in the degradation process of organic matter
in acrylic wastewater was speculated as follows. In the presence of organic molecules
(RH) from acrylic manufacturing wastewater, the generated HO attacked the organic
molecules by absorbing protons, producing highly reactive organic radicals (R ), which
could be further oxidized to generate ROH Equations (10) and (11) [ 20,43,49]. Further,
ROH was oxidized by HO to form R 1OOH and R 2H to achieve the conversion of organic
macromolecules to organic small molecules Equations (10) and (11). In addition, R 1OOH
was easily oxidized by HO to form smaller molecular weight organic matter (R 3H), H 2O
and CO 2Equation (12). The efÔ¨Åcient degradation of organic matter in acrylic wastewater
was achieved through the oxidation reactions of Equations (10)‚Äì(13) (where R, R 1, R2, and
R3represent one or more products in the degradation stage). Furthermore, H 2O2was
generated via a reaction among HO Equation (14).
HO+ RH!R+ H 2O (10)
HO+ R! ROH (11)

 HO‚Ä¢ + HO‚Ä¢ ‚ÜíH2O2 (14) 
The mechanism for the degradation of acrylic manufacturing wastewater by the Fen-
ton process is explained in Figure 9. The chain reaction can continue until the H 2O2 was 
completely consumed because Fe2+ acted as a catalyst and transmitter in the reaction. Var-
ious free radicals and intermedi ate substances, such as HOO‚Ä¢, Fe3+ and HO‚Ä¢, were gen-
erated during the reaction as the nodes of the chemical reaction chain. In addition, Fe3+ 
was readily hydrolyzed and forms complexes. The flocculation and precipitation pro-
cesses of these complexes also played an impo rtant role in removing organic matter. The 
degradation of organic matter was achieved through a series of reactions as described 
above.

4. Conclusions 
1) The optimization analysis combined with the response surface method showed that 
the optimal degradation conditions for ac rylic fiber wastewater using the Fenton 
method are: (i) initial H 2O2 concentration of 60.90 mmol/L; (ii) initial Fe2+ concentra-
tion of 7.44 mmol/L; (iii) pH of 3. The predicted degradation efficiency of the model 
equation was 59.8%, and the actual COD degradation rate was 63.2%. 
2) The deviation between the actual and fitted model values was less than 5%, indicat-
ing that the model equation had a high degr ee of credibility. According to the analy-
sis of the influence of factors and variables, it can be seen that the influence order of 
the three factors was [H 2O2] > [Fe2+] > pH. In addition, the interaction between [Fe2+] 
and pH had the most significant impact on the degradation of COD.
