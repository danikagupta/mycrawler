ABSTRACT  
In this work,  the effectiveness of electro -Fenton process degradation of sodium dodecylbenzene sul fonate 
(SDBS) anionic surfactant in acidic wastewater was investigated. Taguchi method  was applied  to study the 
effect of process parameters on oxidation of SDBS pollutant . An orthogonal array  L9 experimental design 
that allows investigat ing the simultaneou s variation of current density , initial  acidity of wastewater , and 
the initial SDBS concentration was employed to evaluate the effect of these parameters as  control  factors . 
Taguchi experimental design in dynamic sense was carried out with  electrolysis  time chosen  as signal 
factor . Each experiment comprises  the addition of peroxide (170 mg l-1; 0.005M) as a fixed component of 
Fenton 's reagent and  NaCl (1.5 mg l-1) as supportive electrolyte.  The results revealed  that SD BS 
degradation in  acidic aqueous phase, can reached high values by the electro -Fenton process . The 
estimation of linear model coefficients for S/N (signal to noise) ratios expression  has acceptable fitness of 
93.5% with the selected control and signal factors . Main effects  and analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates 
that the current density and the acidity have high impact on electro -Fenton degradation of SDBS process 
with high sum of squ ares and low p -values  that signifies  the 0.05 α -level.  Moreover, Taguchi optimal 
analysi s indicates that high S/N ratio of response can be obtained with 0.3 mA  cm-2 current density,  
pH=2 initial acidity of wastewater, and 10 mg  l-1 initial SDBS surfactant concentration .

1. Introduction  
 
Surfactants are normally consisting of large molecules with both, hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, 
highly soluble in water, once discharged into lakes, rivers and seas can cause a great environmental 
problem. So, its study is interesting not only for being possible pollutants of domestic and industrial 
effluents but also because they are good models of complex pollutants.  
Surfactants are widely used in industry to promote t he dispersion of organic species in water , thus, they 
are widely used in the formulation of soaps, detergents, inks, etc. (Louhichi  et al. , 2008) .  
Sodium dodecylbenzene  sulfonate (SDBS) is a chemical compound (C18H29SO 3Na has a molecular  weight 
equal to 3 48.48 g  mol−1) widely used as a  well-known example  of anionic surfactants. It consists of a 
benzene ring (Fig. 1) coupled with a large aliphatic chain and a sul fonic group. The benzene ring and the 
aliphatic chain provide the hydrophobic behavior  while the sulphonic group provides the hydrophilic 
behavior  (Ying, 2006 ). 80  GHANIM

Chemical and electrochemical oxidation treatment of surfactants was previously studied in literature  
(Méndez -Díaz et al., 2009; Lin et al. , 1999; Aloui et al. , 2009) . Over the past few decades, studies have 
been conducted on new technologies known as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which have been 
proven highly effective in the oxidation of organic  and inorganic micropollutants , particularly in cases 
where the contaminant species are difficult to remove by biological or physicochemical processes  
(Méndez -Díaz et al. , 2009) . Most AOPs are based on the generation of OH· radicals in the medium. These 
free radicals are  highly reactive species, capable of successfully attacking the majority of organic and 
inorganic compounds,  with very high second -order rate constants of typically ≥109 M−1 s−1 (Méndez -Díaz 
et al. , 2010) . 
Advance d oxidation processes (AOPs) based on class ic Fenton processes are usually developed to treat 
aqueous organic pollutants. Fenton process using zero valence iron, Fenton -like reactions, photo -Fenton, 
and electro -Fenton (EF) has  been proven effective for the degradation of organic pollutants . Fenton’ s 
reagent, a homogeneous catalytic system comprising hydrogen peroxide and a ferrous salt (Fe+2 and H 2O2) 
leads to the formation of OH· and other reactive free radicals, which are capable of oxidizing many organic 
pollutants and converting them to lower molecular weight compounds and eventually to carbon dioxide 
and water . Presently, (AOPs) have been used for wastewater treatment, particularly in cases where 
Fenton’s reagents are added to the reactor from outside, and inert electrodes having high catalyti c activity 
are used as anode material  (Neyens and Baeyens, 2003; Mojtaba  and Soghraa, 2014 ). For an electro -
Fenton process, either H 2O2 or ferrous ion is continuously generated or regenerated on the electrode and 
their accumulative concentrations in aqueou s solution depend on a competition between their 
generation rate and consumption rate ( Nidheesh and Gandhimathi, 2012; Jiang and Mao, 2012) , however, 
Fe+2 can also be provided from sacrificial cast iron anodes (Farhadi et al. , 2012; Eyüp Atmaca, 2009 ; Bril las 
et al. , 2002 ). The electro -Fenton process is carried out with a conventional anode and the oxidation power 
of electrogenerated H 2O2 is enhanced by addition of Fe2+ to the solution because hydroxyl radical O H· is 
formed from the classical Fenton’s reaction between Fe2+ and H 2O2 (Zuo and Hoigne, 1992) :  
Fe2+ + H 2O2 + H+ → Fe3+ + OH· + H 2O (1) 
RH + OH· → R· + H 2O (2) 
A wide variety of electrode materials have been suggested: dimensionally stable anodes (DSA®) (e.g. RuO 2 
or ZrO 2 coated Ti), thin film oxide anodes (PbO 2, SnO 2), noble metals (e.g. platina) and carbon -based 
anodes (Lissens, 2003). The latter encompass, beside the traditional graphite electrodes (e.g. carbon felt, 
graphite granules and glassy carbon), and also the re cently developed synthetic boron -doped diamond 
(BDD) thin film electrodes (Panizza et al. , 2005; Kong et al. , 2006 ; Weiss et al. , 2006) . 
The aim of this work was to investigate advance electro -oxidation process (AEOPs) of SD BS surfactant  
experimentally and then analyzed using Taguchi method . The objective of the present study was to 
examine the effect of independent variables  (acidity, current density, and initial SDBS concentration 
factors ) on the performance of the electro -Fenton oxidation process  via deg radation rate of SDBS . The 
approach uses an efficient experimental design to determine the optim um set of factors t hat maximize 
the response variable (SDBS degradation). Taguchi’s method seeks to minimize the effect of noise and  
maximizes a signal to noise ratio (S/N) that provides a robust optimum. Hence this approach investigates  
the three factors main effects and the electrolysis time as signal factor interactions  on electro -Fenton 
degradation of SDBS.  
APPLICATION OF TAGUCHI METHOD FOR ELECTRO -FENTON DEGRADATION OF SDBS ANIONIC SURFACTANT  81 
  2. Materials and Methods  
 
2.1. Experimental Set -up 
Electro -Fenton experiments were carried out using batch wise 1000  mL flatted -bottom  Pyrex glass reactor  
having the appropriate aqueous solution of SD BS solution. The reactor (Fig.2) was equipped with magnetic 
stirrer (HP -3000)  without temperature control. The electrolysis process was established using DC 
Regulated Power Supply ( QJE-QI5030S 0 -50V/30A ) and a current controlled through rheostat 
(Wheatstone Type 2755 -Japan). The current was kept invariant in each test by a rheostat and measured 
by Digital Multimeter (VICTOR -70C).  Three  electrodes of carbon steel in dimensions of 150×50×1 mm were 
mounted vertically centered and operated with monopolar connection  mode  (MP). The solution acidity  
was measured with  (pH 211, Hanna, USA ) pH-meter .  
2.2. Experimental Procedure  
Each experiment was carried out by adding sodium dodecyl benzene  sulfonate  (SDBS) (analytic grade  
obtained from Merck, Germany ) to the reactor at the desired concentration.    
Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2, 33 %w/v, Merck -Germany ) were added with concentration  170 mg l-1 (0.005M) 
and the concentration of Fe2+ ions generation increases proportionally with  the increase of applied current 
and time to be within 105 -208 mg  l-1 (0.005 -0.01 M) for 60 min. electrolysis time according to Faradays 
law. Before e ach run the electrodes were treated with 15% -wt HCl for cleaning, washed with distilled 
water prior to use. All batch experimental runs were achieved at constant initial pH and constant 150 rpm 
at ambient temperature 25±1◦C in the laboratory . A weighted amount of sodium dodecyl benzene  
sulfonate  (SDBS) was used  for synthetic wastewater , and sodium chloride was added to solution in 
1.5 mg  l-1 concentration  as a support electrolyte . Electrolysis  was executed with measured current using 
power supply.  For each run (a row in L 9 orthogonal array s) three sample s of liquid w ere analyzed after 
each run (taken at 10, 30, and 60 min.) for SDBS surfactant concentration. The surfactant concentration 
was determined by the standard meth ods using (UV-1800 Shimadzu/Japan) spectrophotometer (APHA, 
1992) .

2.3. Experimental Design and Data Analysis  
Taguchi method is a robust statistical tool that allows the independent evaluation of the responses with 
minimum number of experiments. It employs orthogonal arrays for experimental design and S/N ratio 
instead of responses to makes the process performance insensitive (robust) to variation with respect to 
uncontrolled or noise factors by the proper design of parameters  (Mohan et al. , 2005). This approach 
handles  less numbers  of experiments to identify and optimize parameters to achieve desired response , 
82  GHANIM  
and it utilizes full fractional design called orthogonal array s, and ANOVA as a tool for analysis  (Mohammadi  
et al. , 2004) . Orthogonal arrays are the minimum set of experiments which represents the various 
combinations  of factors. Output of the orthogonal arrays is optimized with respect to signal to noise ratio 
(S/N) of the responses , thus it reduces the proces s variability ( Signal/noise (S/N) ratios, which provide a 
measure of robustness vs. the control factors.    
However, a  measure of robustness is actually a measure of the deviation of the response from the desired 
value  (Cuevas  et al. , 2009). Moreover, " Signal " implies the mean value while "noise " shows the standard 
deviation  term;  hence  lower ing variability in the process is ensured through maximizing the S/N ratio.  
Dynamic experiment al design of Taguchi method was used to determine the optimum factors for electro -
Fenton oxidation of sodium  dodecylbenzene sulfonate degradation in synthetic acidic wastewater. The 
experimental design, based on standard L 9 orthogonal array, is conducted to change the settings of the 
various process parameters using the computer software package program (M initab  version 15) .The 
selected levels of factors  current density CD  (0.3, 0.4. and 0.5 mA  cm-2), initial acidity of wastewater pH 
(2, 4, and 6 ), and initial SDBS surfactant IC  (10, 30, and 50 mg  l-1) were chosen as control factors for 
optimization through Taguchi orthogonal array experimental design. Each factor was varied at the three 
levels (Table  1). Dynamic Taguchi experimental design was established with 10, 30 and 60 min.  levels 
electrolysis time as a signal factor implies that only 9 experiments with different levels  of control factors 
were  required to investigate  electro -Fenton oxidation  of SDBS.  
 
3. Results  and discussion  
 
The Taguchi method not only helps in saving considerable time and cost, but also leads to a more fully 
developed process (Phadke, 1989).  The data obtained from the experiments were analyzed  with Taguchi 
method . Taguchi recommends analyzing  the mean response for each run and also suggests analyzing 
variation using an appropriately chosen  signal -to-noise ratio (S/N). Taguchi used the signal -to-noise (S/N) 
ratio as a performance measure in a dynamic system to assess the robustness  of a process  (Tong et al. , 
2004) and showed the magnitude of the interactions between control factors and noise factors. For the 
larger the better responses, the following relation is used for  the S /N calculation.

Where y i represent response variables and "n" donates the number of experiments . 
To reduce t he variability in the response due to noise , the computer program Minitab software  calculates 
a separate standard deviation for each combination of control factor levels in  the design.  The product 
array is used to systematically test various combinations of the control factor settings over all 
combinations of noise factors after which the mean response and standard deviation may be 
approximated for each run.

  The preferred parameter settings are then determined through analysis of the “signal -to-noise” (S /N) 
ratio , where factor levels that maximize the appropriate S /N ratio are optimal.   
3.1 Orthogonal  Array Design  
The three -factor  having three -level s L9 (33) orthogonal array design of experiment  for electro -Fenton 
degradation of SDBS anionic surfactant  in acidic wastewater  are shown  in Table 1. L9 orthogonal array was 
selected to determine the optimal conditions with minimum number of experiments.  It implies that only 
9 experiments with different parameters and a signal factor  of three  levels were  selected  to study  the 
electro -Fenton oxidation  expe riments , which in conventional full factorial design would be 33 = 27 
experimental runs.

According to th is approach based on Taguchi 's design method, each row of the orthogonal array 
represents a run, wh ere a specific set of factor  levels would  be tested. For dynamic design,  each run of 
experiment having three levels of signal factor were tested to indicate  its contribution on S/N ratios of 
responses.  The combination of the orthogonal array levels in table (1) and the levels in table (2) 
established the dynamic experimental design . 
3.2 Main Effects of Control Factors for S /N Ratios  
For dynamic response with signal reference of 30 and response reference of  95 the m ain effect s of current 
density, acidity and initial SDBS concentration on S/N ratios were plotted in Fig. 3 to Fig. 5, respectively.  
In these figures the effect of  control factors on S /N ratios (mean response) for electro -Fenton degradation 
of SDBS anionic surfactant are shown  graphically . 
However, the mean in Taguchi is the average response for each combination of control factor levels in the 
design. Based on the suggested values given in Table 1, each experiment was conducted to validate the 
optimized results. Primary visual contributions according to the results obtained from some arbitrary 
experiments indicates that approximately more than 90% of the SDBS degradation was performed at high 
values of current density.  
Generally, it was found that the S/N ratios of response will be increased  with the increase of current 
density, decrease of initial acidity, and the decrease of initial SDBS surfactant concentration. Higher 
applied current density, as expected, offers higher electro -regeneration of ferrous ions from ferric ions, 
and increases t he efficiency of electro -Fenton chain reactions ( Nidheesh and Gandhimathi, 2012 ).  
Consequently, high degradation rates of SDBS (high S/N ratios) were achieved with logarithmic increase 
of current density as shown in Fig. 3.The pH of wastewater plays domin ant role in electro -Fenton process 84  GHANIM  
and can affects the activity of both the oxidant and the substrate, the speciation of iron and hydrogen 
peroxide decomposition ( Zhang , et al. , 2005).  
  
Figure 3.  Main effect of CD on S/N ratios  Figure 4.  Main effect of pH on S/N ratios  
The effect of pH on the SDBS surfactant degradation and S/N ratios can be seen in Fig. 4. It shows that if 
the pH values of wastewater decrease  in polynomial manner, the S/N ratios of response will be increased 
and then a high degradation rate can be occurred .  
 
Figure 5.  Main effect of IC on S /N ratios  
Moreover, t he initial concentration of SDBS surfactant in wastewater plays an important role in the 
electro -Fenton process as shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen from this figure;  a linear increase  of initial SDBS 
concentration has resulted in high er decrease of S/N ratios and degradation rate and vice versa . This is 
likely due to lack of coagulant Fe3+ for adsorbing excess surfactant in high concentration since  the total 
amount of coagulant (i.e.  Fe(OH) 3) is constant for all surfactant concentrations at the s pecific  conditions.  
3.3 Linear Model Design  
The relationship between control factors and response for electro -Fenton degradation of SDBS in term of 
S/N ratios was analyzed using Taguchi method . The Estimation of dynamic linear model coefficients is  
shown in table 3, where the SDBS degradation response represented as S/N ratios assessed as a function 
of initial pH, current density  (CD) , and initial SDBS concentration o f wastewater  combined with signal 
factor electrolysis time (TI) .  
Linear model analysis provides the coefficient s for each factor at the low level, their p -values and an 
analysis of variance. This result  determines whether  the factors are significantly related to the response 
data and each factor's relative importance in the model.  The order of the coefficients by absolute value 
indicates the relative importance of each factor to the response; the factor with the biggest co efficient 
APPLICATION OF TAGUCHI METHOD FOR ELECTRO -FENTON DEGRADATION OF SDBS ANIONIC SURFACTANT  85 
  has the greatest impact. Clearly, the result of table 3 indicates that the current density factor has the 
greatest impact on S/N ratios, followed by the acidity and finally by the initial SDBS concentration.  
Table 3 demonstrates the estimation of  linear model coefficients for S/N ratios in term of statistical 
parameters , standard error, T -test and probability value. Data given in this table clarify that  the model 
was significant at the 95% confidence level since some p -values were less than 0.05.  The probability value 
(p-value) is used as a tool to check the significance of each factor. It was found that the factors with serially 
major effect on SDBS degradation were the initial acidity pH 2  and current density 0.3 mA cm-2 and initial 
SDBD concentr ation 10 mg  l-1, having p -values of 0.0308, 0.0207 and 0.0514, respectively, which accords 
the best fit for dynamic linear model with high estimated correlation coefficient:  R2 = 93.5%, R2adj = 92.8% . 
In contrary, the midlevel of control factors, initial acidity pH 4 and current density 0.4 mA  cm-2 and initial 
SDBD concentration 30 mg  l-1, having p -values of 0.41, 0.123 and 0.981, respectively, which accords the 
less fit for dynamic linear model.

3.4 Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)  
Analysis of the experimental data using ANOVA (analysis of variance) and factor effects give the factors, 
which are statistically significant and result in finding the optimum levels of factors for design parameters 
through confirmation experiments (Mohan et al. , 2005). Taguchi analysis of variance (ANOVA) is often 
used to determine the factors  that influence the average response and the factors that influence the 
signal -to-noise ratio. Sum of squares (SS) , mean square (variance) , F-value, and p -value  based on S/N data 
are presented in Table  4.  
The sequential and adjusted sum of squares in the analysis of variance also indicates  the relative 
importance of each factor; the factor with the biggest sum of squares has the greatest impact.  The sums 
of squa res for the coefficients in table 4  indicate  that the current density factor  having the highest SS 
value followed by acidity and initial SDBS concentration factors.

Note: DF; degree of freedom, SS; the sum of the squares, F-value ; Fisher's test,  p-value; probability

Moreover,  the p -values  for the coefficients in table 4  indicates that the current density factor with lowest 
p-value (0.01) is significant in the model at the 0.05 α -level , followed by acidity and initial  SDBS 
concentration factors with higher p -values of 0.0215 and 0.045, respectively , but still  significant in the 
model with their low standard deviations at the 0.05 α -level. According to these results, the current 
density factor has the greatest effect on  S/N ratios and mean response.  It is evident from F -values, that 86  GHANIM  
all the factors considered in the experimental design had statistically significant effects at 95% confidence 
limit.  
3.5 Optim um Electro -Fenton Parameters  
The response table  5 show s the aver age of each response characteristic ( means S/N ratios)  for each level 
of each factor. The table includes  ranks based on Delta statistics, which compare the relative magnitude 
of effects. The Delta statistic is the highest minus the lowest average for each factor. M initab assigns ranks 
based on Delta values; rank 1 to the highest Delta value, rank 2 to the se cond highest, and so on. The 
ranks indicate the relative importance of each factor to the response.  
Consequently, t he obtained results  for S/N ratio in table  5 show s that the current density  has the greatest 
effect on the variability of the response, whic h was also shown  early  in the linear model analysis. Because 
it is always needed  to reduce the variability in the measurement system, the signal -to-noise (S/N) ratio 
should be maximized and reduce d the standard deviation. The response table and also the main effects 
plot indicate s that level 1 of current density  (CD = 0.3mA  cm-2) with S/N ratio 48.73 , level  3 of acidity  
(pH=2) with S/N ratio 46.73, and level 3  of initial surfactant concentration  (IC = 10 mg l-1) with S/N ratio 
43.89 , will reduce d the variation in the response. These levels produce  the highest S/N ratios and lowest 
standard deviations.

Table 6 shows a summary of the predicted result for S/N ratio, slope, and standard deviation obtained by 
Minitab software that confirm the previous claimed results obtained in response table. Accordingly, by 
the use of Taguchi result predictor to determine which level of each factor provides the best result.  The 
predictor indicates that the high S/N ratio of respo nse can be obtained with 0.3 mA cm-2 current density, 
pH=2 initial a cidity of wastewater, and 10 mg l-1 initial SDBS surfact ant concentration.  These results mirror 
the factor ranks in the response tables.  
 
4. Conclusion  
 
This work demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of using Taguchi method as statistical 
experimental design to identify best independent variables (factors) for Electro -Fenton degradation of 
SDBS surfactant  from synthetic wastewater . The Taguchi data analysis method was utilized to study three  
experimental  factors at three levels (L 9 orthogonal array). Effect s of acidity (2, 4, 6), current density (0.3, 
0.4, 0.5  mA cm-2), initial SDBS concentration (10, 30, 50  mg l-1) on oxidation process with electrolysis time 
as a signal factor (10, 30, 60 min.)  were studied . However, ANOVA analysis was applied to evaluate th e 
relative importance of the effect of various factors. It was realized that all factors have significant effect 
on the response and th e current density has the largest contribution due to highest  total sum of squares 
and lowest p -value , confidently, has a  major effect on the oxidation of SDBS in electro -Fenton process. 
The present approach indicate s that the  application of Taguchi experimental design accomplished  high APPLICATION OF TAGUCHI METHOD FOR ELECTRO -FENTON DEGRADATION OF SDBS ANIONIC SURFACTANT  87 
  S/N ratio of response that can be obtained with 0.3 mA cm-2 current density, pH=2 initial  acidity of 
wastewater, and 10 mg  l-1 initial SDBS surfactant concentration.
