Abstract Azo dyes are recalcitrant pollutants com-
monly found in several industrial wastewaters, such
as those originated from textile factories, which
generally persist to biological transformation. Dis-charge of these efﬂuents in open water bodies not
only represents an aesthetic problem, but also may
limit photosynthesis in aquatic plants. Furthermore,
many azo dyes and products derived from their
partial transformation in the environment (e.g. aro-matic amines) may be toxic or carcinogenic. Biolog-
ical wastewater treatment processes have emerged as
promising technologies to remove azo dyes fromindustrial efﬂuents and intensive research has been
conducted during the last two decades in order to
elucidate the mechanisms involved in the reductivedecolourisation of azo dyes. The present work
describes the main biochemical and microbiological
aspects involved in the reductive decolourisation ofazo dyes by anaerobic bacteria.Keywords Anaerobic decolourisation /C1

1 Introduction
In 2000, it was estimated that 5 910
10kg of ﬁbres
were produced worldwide, which consumed more
than 8 9108kg of different dyes and pigments
(Broadbent 2001 ). In 2005, the global market size for
dyes, pigments and intermediaries was US$ 23
billion. In terms of total volume, the global dyestuff
production was 3.4 91010kg, which accounted for
annual global sales of nearly US$ 6 billion (Dyes and
Pigments 2010 ). Unfortunately, linked to the great
economical beneﬁts given by the textile sector, severeenvironmental problems have been created due to
discharge or inadequate disposal of wastes. The most
important contaminants released by the textile indus-try are dyes, which enter into the environment mainly
via discharge of wastewaters.
To judge the relative share of the different dye
classes in the wastewater of textile-processing indus-
tries, dye consumption data should be consideredtogether with the degree of ﬁxation of the different
dye classes. Recent statistics on the global production
and use of dyes and on the relative distributionamong the different dye classes are not readily
available.F. J. Cervantes ( &)

DOI 10.1007/s11157-011-9228-9Table 1summarises the estimated degree of ﬁxa-
tion for different dye/ﬁbre combinations, which
indicate that approximately 75% of the dyes dis-charged by Western-Europe textile-processing indus-
tries belong to the classes of reactive ( *36%), acid
(*25%) and direct ( *15%), all of which are dye
classes primarily composed by azo dyes. In fact, azo
dyes, which are characterised by the presence of one
to several –N =N– chromophore groups in their
structure, constitute the largest ( *70% in weight)
class of dyes applied in textile processing (Van der
Zee 2002 ). The markets for the dyes are mainly
dominated by reactive and disperse dyes. In fact, the
demand for these two dyes is expected to grow in the
future also. Nations like China, South Korea andTaiwan are strong players in the ﬁeld of disperse
dyes. Interestingly, India has taken lead in production
of reactive dyes because of the availability of anintermediate called vinyl sulphone in the country
(Dyes and Pigments 2010 ).
In recent years, new legislation has affected
dyestuff producers’ product portfolios. For instance,
the European Commission banned many azo dyes in
2002 and navy blue (a chromate-based azo dye, oneof the most widely used dyes in the leather industry)
in June 2004. REACH (an EU regulation of chem-
icals), which was enacted in 2007, also affectsconsumption of synthetic dyes.
2 Environmental and eco-toxicological problems
associated with the discharge of textile
wastewaters
Most textile wastewaters are highly coloured because
they are typically discharged with a dye contain in therange 10–200 mg/L and many dyes are visible in
water at concentrations as low as 1 mg/L (O
0Neill
et al. 1999 ; Pandey et al. 2007 ). Thus, discharge of
these efﬂuents in open water bodies not only
represents an aesthetic problem, but also may limit
photosynthesis in aquatic plants. As dyes aredesigned to be chemically and photolytically stable,
they are highly persistent in natural environments.
For instance, the half-life of hydrolysed ReactiveBlue 19 (RB19) is about 46 years at pH 7 and 25 /C176C
(Hao et al. 2000 ). The release of dyes may therefore
present eco-toxic hazard and introduces the potentialdanger of bioaccumulation that may eventually affect
man by transport through the food chain (Dos Santos
et al. 2006a ).
2.1 Bioaccumulation
Intensive research has documented the bioaccumula-
tion tendency of dyestuffs in ﬁsh. The bio-concen-
tration factors (BCF’s) of 75 dyes from differentapplication classes were determined and related to the
partition coefﬁcient n-octanol/water (K
OW) of each
different compound. Water-soluble dyes with lowK
OW(e.g. ionic dyes like acid, reactive and basic
dyes) did not bio-accumulate (generally log
BCF\0.5). For these water-soluble dyes, log P
(log K OW) showed a linear relationship with log BCF;
thus, it was expected that dyestuffs with higher K OW
would bio-accumulate. Nonetheless, water-insoluble
organic pigments with extremely high partition
coefﬁcients did not bio-accumulate probably due to
their extremely low water and fat solubility and alsothe BCF values for disperse dyes, i.e. scarcely soluble
compounds with a moderately lipophilic nature, were
much lower than expected. In all cases, log BCF \2,Table 1 Estimated degree

123which indicates that none of the dyes tested showed
any substantial bio-accumulation (Anliker 1979 ;
Anliker et al. 1981 ,1988 ; Anliker and Moser 1987 ;
Van der Zee 2002 ).
2.2 Eco-toxicity of dyestuffs
The eco-toxicological effects of several distinct dyes
have been intensively investigated during the lastdecades. These toxicity studies diverge from tests
with aquatic organisms (ﬁsh, algae, bacteria, etc.) to
tests with mammals. Furthermore, research has alsodocumented the inhibitory effects of dyes on the
activity of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in
wastewater treatment consortia. The acute toxicity ofdyestuffs is generally low. Algal growth (photosyn-
thesis), tested with 56 and 46 commercially dyestuffs,
respectively, was generally not inhibited at dyeconcentrations below 1 mg/L and with cationic–basic
dyes being the most acutely toxic dyes for algae
(Greene and Baughman 1996 ; Little and Chilling-
worth 1974 ). Fish mortality tests showed that 2% out
of 3,000 commercial dyestuffs tested had LC
50(lethal
concentration causing 50% of mortality) valuesbelow 1 mg/L. The most acutely toxic dyes for ﬁsh
are basic dyes, especially those with a tri-phenyl-
methane structure. Fish also seem to be relativelysensitive to many acid dyes (Clarke and Anliker
1980 ). Mortality tests with rats evidenced that only
1% out of 4,461 commercial dyestuffs tested hadLC
50values below 250 mg/kg body weight (Clarke
and Anliker 1980 ). Therefore, acute sensitisation
reactions by humans to dyestuffs often occur. Espe-cially, some disperse dyes have been found to cause
allergic reactions, i.e. eczema or contact dermatitis
(Specht and Platzek 1995 ).
Chronic effects of dyes have been studied for
several decades with special emphasis on food
colorants, usually azo compounds. Furthermore, theeffects of occupational exposure to dyestuffs of
human workers in dye manufacturing and dye
utilising industries have received attention. Azo dyes
in puriﬁed form are hardly ever directly mutagenic or
carcinogenic, except for some azo dyes with freeamino groups in their structure. However, several
aromatic amines readily produced by reductive azo
cleavage are known as mutagens and carcinogens(Van der Zee 2002 ).3 Biological wastewater treatment systems
The biodegradation of azo dyes has been reported for
a wide variety of microorganisms including fungi,
yeasts and bacteria both in pure and mixed cultures(Stolz 2001 ). However, successful applications (e.g.
at full-scale) have only been reported for wastewater
treatment systems combining bacterial consortiaunder anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Several
research papers and full-scale applications have
suggested that combined anaerobic–aerobic biologi-cal treatment systems are the most suitable technol-
ogies available for the treatment of textile efﬂuents,
based on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colourremoval efﬁciencies and on operational costs (Van
der Zee and Villaverde 2005 ). For instance, applica-
tion of upﬂow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactorscombined with aerobic tanks yielded 95–100% of
decolourisation and achieved 95–98% COD removal
efﬁciencies during the treatment of textile efﬂuents atfull scale (Jianrong et al. 1994 ; Kuai et al. 1998 ). In
general, the anaerobic step is considered as the rate-
limiting step during the biodegradation of azo dyesmainly due to electrons transfer restrictions (e.g. very
slow transfer of electrons to azo bounds) and to
toxicity over the bacteria responsible for reducing azodyes in anaerobic treatment systems (Dos Santos
et al. 2007 ).
4 Anaerobic reduction of azo dyes
The reductive decolourisation of azo dyes comprises
the cleavage of the dyes’ azo linkages, resulting in
the formation of–generally colourless, but potentiallyhazardous–aromatic amines. The ﬁrst study related to
the reduction of an azo compound by bacteria was
reported by Brohm and Frohwein ( 1937 ), who
documented the reduction of azo dyes used in food-
processing industries by lactic acid bacteria isolated
from human intestine. The study was relevant due tothe potential exposure, which represents the forma-
tion and eventual bioaccumulation of carcinogenic
aromatic amines, derived from the dyes’ cleavage, inhumans. Since then, multiple research studies have
documented the capacity of a large diversity of
bacteria and archaea to reduce azo dyes underanaerobic conditions (Stolz 2001 ; Dos Santos et al.
2007 ). In the following sections, the mechanismsRev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2011) 10:125–137 127
123involved in the reductive decolourisation of azo dyes
and the role of different bacterial groups in azo dyes
reduction are described.
4.1 Mechanisms for the reduction of azo dyes
under anaerobic conditions
Different biochemical mechanisms might be involved
in the reductive decolourisation of azo dyes depend-ing on the type of microorganism and on the
environmental conditions prevailing. Several redox
active compounds commonly found in a wide varietyof bacteria (e.g., reduced ﬂavins and hydroquinones)
are capable of rapidly transferring reducing equiva-
lents to azo dyes causing their reductive decolouri-sation (Stolz 2001 ). Figure 1shows the mechanisms
involved in the reductive decolourisation of an azo
dye mediated by a redox mediator (RM). Thespontaneous reaction of the reduced form of different
RM with azo dyes allows for very unspeciﬁc
reductive processes. The capacity of an electronshuttling compound to be effective as a RM for azo
dye reduction theoretically depends on its standard
redox potential (E
00), which should ideally be in
between those of the two eventual half reactions, the
reduction of an azo dye and the oxidation of a
primary electron donor:
– A mediator’s E 00should not be much lower
(ideally higher or less negative) than that of thebiological reducing system (typically -320 mV,
representing the E 00of nicotinamide-phosphate
(NAD(P)H), the cofactor with the lowest oxida-
tion–reduction potential) or the bulk reductant
(e.g. -270 mV in case of sulphide) –otherwise it
will not be reduced sufﬁciently. Hence the
observed failure of cyanocobalamin (Dos Santos
et al. 2004 ) and ethyl viologen (Kudlich et al.
1997 ) to act as a mediator is most probably due to
their too low E 00values: -530 and -480 mV,
respectively. Methyl viologen (E 00=- 440 mV)
was the most reduced shuttling compound with
clear ability to act as a RM for azo dye reduction.
It modestly increased the rate of Acid Red 27reduction by Sphingomonas sp. strain BN6
(Kudlich et al. 1997 ) but its impact on the
reduction of Acid Yellow 23 by Bacteroides
thetaiotaomicron was huge, a 4.5-fold increase of
the reaction rate, similar or even better than that
of mediators with a higher E
00(Chung et al.
1978 ). Especially the latter result is remarkable,
since methyl viologen’s E 0’ is considerably lower
than the indicated boundary level of -320 mV.
– Likewise, a mediator’s E 00should not be much
higher (ideally lower or more negative) than that
of the azo dye –otherwise it will not reduce theazo linkage at sufﬁcient rates. Nevertheless, the
observed failure of 1,4-benzoquinone to act as a
RM (Dos Santos et al. 2005b ) and the poor impact
Fig. 1 Proposed mechanism of anthraquinone-2-sulphonate
(AQS) mediation of amaranth dye decolourisation by Sphingo-
monas sp. Strain BN6. AQS is reduced by the membrane bound
respiratory chain enzyme, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase(ﬁlled box ) to anthrahydroquinone-2-sulphonate (AHQS) and
AHQS transfers the electrons to the dye, causing azo cleavage(Kudlich et al .,1997 )128 Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2011) 10:125–137
123reported for menadione (Chung et al. 1978 ;
Albuquerque et al. 2005 ) are most probably due
to their too high E 00-values: ?263 and -19 mV,
respectively.
In the E 00range between these boundaries, there will
be two opposing trends with respect to a mediator’s E 00
and its impact on the rate of azo dye reduction. In the
second step of mediated azo dye reduction, i.e. the
chemical reaction between the reduced RM and the azo
dye, the reaction rate will increase with decreasing E 00
of the mediator, as has been demonstrated with the
reduction of Acid Red 27 by a series of chemically
reduced quinones with different E 00values (Rau et al.
2002 ). In the ﬁrst step of mediated azo dye reduction, i.e.
reduction of the mediator, an opposite trend, an increase
of the reaction rate with increasing E 00of the mediator,
can be expected. The rate-limiting step of mediated azo
dye reduction will thus be inﬂuenced by the mediator’s
E00, with either the reduction of the dye or that of the
mediator being rate-limiting, at higher and lower E 00
values, respectively. At midrange, combination of bothtrends may reveal the optimum mediator’s E
00(unique
for each dye/reducing system combination), where both
reaction steps proceed at equal rate. However, in
biological systems, such an optimum E 00could not be
conﬁrmed: studies with multiple redox mediators under
otherwise similar conditions did not show any relation-ship between a mediator’s E
00and the rate of azo dye
reduction (Chung et al. 1978 ; Kudlich et al. 1997 ;R a u
et al. 2002 ), and mediators with identical E 00(ﬂavin-
adenine dinucleotide (FAD), ﬂavin mononucleotide
(FMN) and anthraquinone-2-sulphonate (AQS)) often
had largely different impacts. For instance, Kudlichet al. ( 1997 ) observed that Acid Red 27 reduction by
Sphingomonas sp. strain BN6 was stimulated to a
decreasing extent by the following mediators (valuesbetween brackets show E
00in mV): AQS( -218)[law-
sone( -139)[anthraquinone-2,6- disulphonate (AQDS)
(-184)[benzyl viologen( -360)[methyl violo-
gen(-440)[FAD ( -219). Moreover, the impact of
ﬁve quinoid mediators on the reduction of Acid Red 27
by ten pure cultures of distinct classes of bacteriashowed large differences between cultures, with
different sequences of these ﬁve compounds when
ranged according to their effect (Rau et al. 2002 ).
These results reﬂect the diverging and apparently E
00-
independent preferences of biological mediatorreduction. In contrast, in chemical systems, the medi-
ator’s E 00may very well be more important in
determining its reduction rate. Therefore, mediatedazo dye reduction, at least in biological systems, is
largely independent of the mediator’s E
00, and that this
independence is probably mostly due to reduction ofthe RM rather than to that of the dye.
A property of electron shuttling compounds that
deserves attention is the ability to cross cell mem-branes. It has been demonstrated that the azoreduc-
tase activity of cell extracts can be much higher than
that of intact cells and that the cell membrane forms abarrier for dyes and mediators (Kudlich et al. 1997 ;
Russ et al. 2000 ). Hence, mediated azo dye reduction
bySphingomonas xenophaga , with the sulfonated
quinone AQS as the optimum mediator, is presum-
ably associated with the membrane-bound respiratory
chain enzyme NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase(Kudlich et al. 1997 ; Rau et al. 2002 ), and several
other species are likely to use similar membrane-
associated enzyme systems. However, as has recentlybeen shown for E. coli , the mechanism can also be
based on intracellular enzymes in combination with a
mediator that diffuses through the cell membrane. E.
coli’s mediator-dependent ‘azoreductase’ was identi-
ﬁed as two cytosolic oxygen-insensitive nitroreduc-
tases, acting as quinone reductases. The mediator waslawsone, the only quinone with a mediator-feasible
E
0’ that could be reduced by the enzymes (Rau and
Stolz 2003 ). Lawsone’s apparent ability to cross the
cell membrane is probably related to its small size
and its relative lipophilicity (no charged substituents).
Depending on the preferences of intracellular reduc-tases in other species, there may be more shuttling
compounds with membrane-crossing properties that
could act as powerful mediators for azo dyereduction.
More recently, azo dyes could be demonstrated as
terminal electron acceptors during the anaerobicoxidation of organic substrates by Shewanella decol-
orationis S12. The biochemical mechanism of azo
respiration involves a formate dehydrogenase, a
hydrogenase, cytochrome P450, menaquinone and
an azoreductase located at the external site of thecellular membrane (Hong et al. 2007 ). Figure 2
illustrates the mechanisms involved in azo respiration
byS. decolorationis S12.
Further studies were conducted to elucidate
electron transfer pathways for azo reduction byRev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2011) 10:125–137 129
123S. decolorationis S12 using a mutant S12–22 which
had a transposon insertion in ccmA. The results
suggested that there are two different pathways forelectron transport to azo bonds. Mature c-type
cytochromes were identiﬁed as essential electron
mediators for the extracelular reduction of azo dyesby intact cells, while an alternative pathway without
the involvement of mature c-type cytochromes,
NADH-dependent oxidoreductase-mediated electrontransfer pathway could reduce lowly polar sulfonated
azo dyes inside the whole cells or highly polar
sulfonated azo dyes in the cell extracts without
bacterial membrane barriers (Chen et al. 2010 ).
4.2 Role of different bacterial groups in azo dyes
reduction
4.2.1 Fermentative and methanogenic
microorganisms
As mentioned above, the ﬁrst studies documenting
the bacterial reduction of azo dyes was reported on
lactic acid bacteria by Brohm and Frohwein ( 1937 ).More recently, several different fermentative bacte-
ria, commonly found in the anaerobic consortia of
anaerobic wastewater treatment systems, have beenreported to be capable of reducing azo dyes
(Table 2). The rate and extent of reduction of azo
dyes depends on the fermentative microorganism, thetype of dye and the initial concentration. It is
important to mention that hydrolytic and fermentative
bacteria may play an important role during theanaerobic treatment of textile wastewaters because
this kind of efﬂuents contain different polymers, such
as starch, which are utilized during the production offabrics (Dos Santos et al. 2006a ). In fact, high
decolourisation efﬁciencies have been achieved in
anaerobic bioreactors in which starch and carboxy-methyl cellulose have been used as energy source
(Isik and Sponza 2008 ; Gnanapragasam et al. 2010 ).
Recent experiments documented in detail the role
of glucose-fermenting bacteria on the reductive
decolourisation of azo dyes. Glucose is a relevant
substrate because it derives from the hydrolysis ofpolymers, such as starch (Dos Santos et al. 2006a ).
For that purpose, sludge incubations were amended
with selective inhibitors of fermentative (vancomy-cin) and methanogenic (2-bromoethane sulfonate
(BES)) microorganisms during the reductive decolo-
urisation of azo dyes (Dos Santos et al. 2005a ,
2006b ). Poor decolourisation of Reactive Red 2
(RR2) and Reactive Orange 14 (RO14) occurred in
sludge incubations inhibited by vancomycin, ascompared with uninhibited controls, suggesting the
important contribution of glucose-fermenting bacte-
ria. Furthermore, sludge incubations inhibited byBES (e.g. no methane production detected) showed a
higher decolourisation rate compared to uninhibited
controls, conﬁrming the contribution of glucose-fermenting microorganisms. These results also sug-
gested that methanogens might not be involved in the
reduction of azo dyes; however, as discussed below,methanogenic microorganisms might have used an
alternative pathway for reducing azo dyes in which
methyl coenzyme M is not involved.
The speciﬁc role of methanogenic archaea in the
reductive decolourisation of azo dyes has not beenfully elucidated, although it is conceivable that they
may play a major role considering that high decolo-
urisation efﬁciencies have been related with highbiogas productions in anaerobic bioreactors (Cervan-
tes et al. 2001 ; Van der Zee et al. 2001 ; Dos SantosARase

123et al. 2005b ). Recent experiments revealed the
important contribution of methanogens on azo dyes
reduction. Indeed, different methanogenic strains,including Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophi-
cusDH,Methanobacterium NJ1 and Methanosarcina
barkeri were able to decolourise RR2 with hydrogen
as an electron donor in axenic cultures (Dos Santos
et al. 2006b ). However, the presence of riboﬂavin as a
RM was essential to achieve the reductive decolo-urisation of RR2 by M. thermoautotrophicus DH and
Methanobacterium NJ1, whereas M. barkeri was
capable of reducing RR2 even in the absence of thisRM. Interestingly, Methanobacterium NJ1 and M.
barkeri could reduce RR2 even in the presence of the
selective inhibitor of methanogens, BES, suggestingthat these strains were able to decolorize RR2 by a
biochemical mechanism in which methyl coenzyme
M is not involved (Li et al. 2010 ).
Further experiments revealed negligible methane
production during the course of reductive decolouri-
sation of different azo dyes by anaerobic consortiawhen different methanogenic substrates (acetate,
methanol, hydrogen and formate) were utilised (Dos
Santos et al. 2006b ; Cervantes et al. 2008 ). Metha-
nogenic activity was more strongly inhibited by
increasing the concentration of azo dyes, which may
be due to competition between methanogenesis andazo dyes reduction for the reducing equivalents
available in the cultures. This hypothesis is supported
by the reversibility of inhibition observed after azodyes were completely reduced (Dos Santos et al.
2006b ; Cervantes et al. 2008 ). Addition of riboﬂavin
as a RM in decolourisation assays attenuated theinhibitory effects of azo dyes by decreasing the
exposure of methanogenic microorganisms to azo
dyes (Cervantes et al. 2008 ). The application of
quinoid RM to continuous decolourising bioreactors
also recovered the methanogenic activity and decolo-
urisation efﬁciency, which were collapsed due totoxicity effects or RR2 (Van der Zee et al. 2001 ).
4.2.2 Sulphate-reducing bacteria
Textile-processing wastewaters may contain high
sulphate concentrations. Sulphate is generally an
additive of dye baths or it may be formed by the
oxidation of more reduced sulphur species used indyeing processes, such as sulphide, hydrosulphide,and dithionite (Van der Zee et al. 2003 ). Sulphate
may have different effects on the reduction of azo
dyes. Firstly, sulphate may compete with the dyes,as an electron acceptor, for the electrons available,
depending on the capacity of the inocula to carry out
sulphate reduction and on the concentration ofsulphate. Secondly, electron equivalents may be
generated by the reduction of sulphate via anaerobic
substrate oxidations; thus, reduced cofactorsinvolved in sulphate reduction may also play a role
in azo dye reductions. Finally, sulphide generation,
via sulphate-reduction, may also contribute to thereduction of azo dyes (Van der Zee et al. 2003 ;
Cervantes et al. 2007 ).
Several studies have documented the reductive
decolourisation of many distinct azo dyes under
sulphate-reducing conditions (Van der Zee et al.
2003 ; Albuquerque et al. 2005 ; Cervantes et al.
2006 ,2007 ); nevertheless, scarce information is
available elucidating the mechanisms involved in
the reductive decolourisation of azo dyes under theseconditions. The collected evidence from these stud-
ies indicates that both the biological activity linked
to sulphate reduction and the chemical reduction by
biogenic sulphide may be important mechanisms,
which promote the reduction of azo dyes under
sulphate-reducing conditions. The simultaneousreduction of azo dyes and sulphate appears as
evidence of the biological contribution in several
studies (Van der Zee et al. 2003 ; Albuquerque et al.
2005 ). However, the role of biogenic sulphide is not
always relevant for azo dyes reduction as several azo
dyes remain unaffected or are poorly reduced inchemical incubations with sulphide provided as a
unique reducing agent (Cervantes et al. 2006 ,2007 ).
The application of RM, such as riboﬂavin, hasenhanced the contribution of sulphide as an effective
reducing agent for azo dyes reduction. Certainly,
addition of riboﬂavin (20 lM) to chemical incuba-
tions provided with sulphide as an electron donor
increased up to 44-fold the rate of decolourisation of
different azo dyes (Cervantes et al. 2007 ). The
quinoid RM, AQDS, also increased the rate of
reduction of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) up to 100-fold(Van der Zee et al. 2000 ). Further studies elucidated
that biogenic sulphide plays a major role during the
microbial decolourisation of different azo dyes whenriboﬂavin is available as a RM (Cervantes et al.
2007 ).134 Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2011) 10:125–137
1235 Conclusions
The information described here indicates that several
distinct biochemical mechanisms are involved in the
reductive decolourisation of azo dyes by bacterialcommunities. Moreover, several bacterial groups com-
monly active in anaerobic wastewater treatment sys-
tems, such as fermentative, methanogenic, sulphate-reducing and azo-reducing microorganisms, appeared
to have important contribution during the reduction of
azo dyes under anaerobic conditions. Nevertheless,several microbiological and biochemical aspects need
to be further investigated in order to better understand
the mechanisms involved in the bacterial reduction ofazo dyes and to enhance the applicability of bacterial
consortia for textile wastewater treatment. For instance,
most studies have been conducted under ideal cultureconditions and the impact of pollutants co-existing in
textile efﬂuents (e.g. surfactants, disinfectants, size
agents, etc.) on the reduction of azo dyes has poorlybeen assessed. Moreover, the role of syntrophic
interactions of different bacterial groups on azo dyes
reduction needs to be addressed in order to optimizedecolourising processes.
