Abstract
The mechanism by which Pseudomonasaeruginosa degraded Navitan Fast Blue S5R was studied using TLC, FTIR,
HPLC and GC–MS analysis. Degradation started with the reduction of azo bonds producing metanilic acid and peri
acid whose presence was conﬁrmed by HPLC. Aniline, the desulfonated product from metanilic acid and salicylic acid
could also be detected by HPLC. GC–MS analysis of the degradation products conﬁrmed the presence of aniline andrevealed the presence of b-ketoadipic acid. Based on these products a probable pathway has been proposed for the
degradation of Navitan Fast Blue S5R by Pseudomonasaeruginosa .

1. Introduction
Modern dyes are required to have high degree of
chemical and photolytic stability in order that theymaintain their structure and color. They are designed to
resist breakdown attributable to time and exposure to
sunlight, water, soap and other parameters such asbleach and perspiration. The color fastness, stabilityand resistance of dyes to degradation have made color
removal from waste waters diﬃcult as they are not
readily degraded under aerobic conditions (O’Neillet al., 1999).
The sulfonic acid groups that are introduced to
increase the water solubility of the dye and theazo group (chromophoric group) confer resistance to
microbial attack, making them recalcitrant to
oxidative decolorization (Kulla et al., 1983; Coughlinet al., 1999). Biodegradation of azo dyes was carried
out by a variety of microorganisms including anaero-
bic and aerobic bacteria (Yatome et al., 1981; Chung
and Kuo, 2000), fungi (Ollikka et al., 1993),actinomycetes (Burk and Crawford, 1998) and algae
(Acuner and Dilek, 2003). While degradation by
actinomycetes and fungi is an oxidative activation ofdyes resulting in the formation of cationic species,making the molecule vulnerable to the nucleophilic
attack of water (Goszczynski et al., 1994), bacterial
degradation of azo dye is often initiated underanaerobic conditions by an enzymic biotransformation
step that involves the cleavage of azo linkages with the
aid of azoreductase utilizing reduced coenzyme aselectron donor (Zimmermann et al., 1982). Under
aerobic conditions, azo dyes have been considered
practically nondegradable by bacteria (Michaels andLewis, 1986). However, Kulla (1981) reported theaerobic degradation of certain sulfonated azo dyes by
Pseudomonas strains. Despite the presence of oxygen
the initial degradation appeared to be the reduction ofthe azo linkage by an oxygen insensitive azo reduc-
tase.

www.elsevier.com/locate/chemosphereIt has been reported that complete mineralization of
dyes is possible only if anaerobic reduction is followed
by aerobic oxidation of the amines formed in thereductive steps (Tan et al., 1999; Rajaguru et al., 2000).Under anaerobic conditions, a number of bacteria are
known to catalyse the reductive cleavage of the azo
bond, which leads to the formation of aromaticamines. These amines are well known for their muta-
genic and carcinogenic potential (Chung et al., 1981;
Chung, 1983). Certain azo dyes, which are known toform carcinogenic amines on reductive cleavage of
the azo bonds, have already been banned (Reife et al.,
1998).
Hence, an attempt has been made to study the aer-
obic degradation of Navitan Fast Blue S5R, a com-
mercial diazo dye used in leather and textile industriesbyPseudomonas aeruginosa and to identify the degra-
dation products by various spectroscopic and chro-
matographic methods so as to enable us to elucidate a
possible mechanism or pathway by which the dye hasbeen degraded. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report
on the mechanism by which this commercially important
dye is degraded by P. aeruginosa .
2. Materials and methods
Biodegradation studies were carried out in 3 l
Hoﬀkin’s ﬂasks containing 1 l of the culture mediumwith 100 mg l
/C01Navitan Fast Blue S5R. The ﬂasks were
inoculated with 2% inoculum containing approximately
2·108cells per ml of P. aeruginosa . The composition
of the culture medium and culture conditions were
described elsewhere (Valli Nachiyar and Suseela Raja-
kumar, 2003). The culture medium containing de-gradation products of Navitan Fast Blue S5R wasdrawn at regular intervals, centrifuged at 10 000 rpm
for 15 min. The supernatants were analyzed by HPLC
(Valli Nachiyar and Suseela Rajakumar, 2003) andthe lyophilized supernatants were analyzed by thin
layer chromatography (TLC) and FTIR. Portion of the
supernatant was extracted thrice with equal volume ofethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous Na
2SO 4and then
the solvent was evaporated in a rotary evaporator. The
ethyl acetate extract was subjected to HPLC and GC–MS analyses.
GC–MS analysis of the ethyl acetate extract was
performed by using Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL-GC
with Turbomass MS spectrometer. The column usedwas PE5 Elite Series 30 m ·0.250 i.d. with the ﬁlm
thickness of 1 lm and the column oven was pro-
grammed between 120 and 260 /C176C at the rate of 10 /C176C
per minute with the injection temperature of 280 /C176C.
Mass spectra were recorded under scan mode in the
range of 40–400 amu.3. Results and discussion
TLC analysis of the lyophilized culture medium
containing the degradation products of Navitan FastBlue S5R on ﬂuorescent silica plates (polygram sil G/
UV, Germany) using the solvent system chloro-
form:ethanol in 9:1 ratio revealed a spot with the R
f
value of 0.12 in the sample incubated for 48 h. Analysis
of this spot by FTIR spectroscopy after extraction with
chloroform showed peaks corresponding to C–H stretchat 2917 and 2841 cm
/C01and C@O stretch at 1727 cm/C01
characteristic of aliphatic carboxylic acid.
HPLC analysis using C-18 reverse phase column
equipped with UV–Visible spectrophotometer was used
to identify the degradation products of Navitan Fast
Blue S5R in the culture supernatant. We have reportedthe presence as well as the amount of metanilic acidproduced during degradation of Navitan Fast Blue S5R
in our previous report (Valli Nachiyar and Suseela Ra-
jakumar, 2003). The compound having the peak at 3.4min reported earlier was found out to be salicylic acid.
Nearly 22.8 mg l
/C01of salicylic acid could be detected
when 100 mg l/C01of Navitan Fast Blue S5R was de-
graded after 24 h of incubation under shake culture
condition, which disappeared after 48 h of incubation.
Peri acid was detected with the RTvalue of 2.3 with the
UV detector set at 265 nm. The concentrations of peri
acid were 24.7 and 32.7 mg l/C01after 24 and 48 h of
incubation respectively and disappeared completelyafter 72 h of incubation.
HPLC analysis carried out on the ethyl acetate extract
of the culture medium containing the degradation prod-
ucts of Navitan Fast Blue S5R (100 mg l
/C01) after 48 h
revealed the presence of aniline with the RTvalue of 10.5.
Mass spectra corresponding to the peak with RT
value of 3.89 indicates a fragmentation pattern with m=z
93, 92, 91 and 65 characteristic of aniline (Fig. 1a and b).
The presence of aniline was conﬁrmed by injecting
authentic aniline as standard. Even though, the molec-ular ion ( m=z160) for b-ketoadipic acid was not seen in
the mass spectra, presence of fragments with m=z101
and 115, strongly suggested its presence indicating alpha
cleavage of the molecular ion (Fig. 1c). The strong m=z
43 signal in the obtained spectrum is characteristic of a
keto group and, in conjunction with other detected
fragments provides strong evidence for the presence ofketo group (Silverstein et al., 1974). The low R
Tvalue for
b-ketoadipic acid may be explained in two ways. It may
be acetylated during extraction with ethylacetate or itmay be acetylated by the enzymes of bacteria (Narro
et al., 1992).
Quantiﬁcation of CO
2(Abubacker et al., 2001) and
NH 3(Jeﬀerey et al., 1989) produced during degradation
showed that nearly 74% of carbon in the dye and 68% of
nitrogen in the dye was converted to CO 2and NH 3
respectively.166 C.Valli Nachiyar,G. SuseelaRajakumar/Chemosphere 57(2004)165–169This investigation provides strong evidence that the
initial step in the degradation of Navitan Fast Blue S5R
byP. aeruginosa was cleavage of azo bond and cor-
roborates with previous reports on bacterial degradationof azo dyes (Haug et al., 1991; Bl €umel et al., 1998). The
presence of salicylic acid shows that the naphthalene
part of the dye must have undergone degradation. It hasbeen reported that salicylic acid was identiﬁed as an
intermediate compound from microbial degradation of
naphthalene (Aranha and Brown, 1981).
The evidence for the formation of b-ketoadipic acid
as identiﬁed from the GC–MS spectra indicates thataniline and salicylic acid formed might have undergone
oxidative deamination to catechol using molecular
oxygen and oxygenases, which through ortho pathway
of reaction involving hydroxylation and decarboxyl-ation reactions resulted in the formation of b-ketoadipic
acid. This result corroborates well with the ﬁndings of
Lyons et al. (1984) who have identiﬁed the formationofcis–cismuconic acid, b-ketoadipic acid and succinic
acid which ultimately enters the TCA cycle resulting
in the release of aniline carbon as CO
2. Similarly the
salicylic acid formed would have been converted tocatechol by decarboxylation followed by hydroxylation

the GC–MS since this is a diﬃcult intermediate to isolate
(You and Bartha, 1982; Lyons et al., 1984) whereas, b-
ketoadipic acid identiﬁed in the GC–MS indicates thatthis metabolite might have been formed from metanilic
acid or peri acid or diaminonaphthalene or from all the
three of them, which ﬁnally enters the TCA cycleresulting in the release of CO
2.
Based on the above ﬁndings probable mechanism for
the degradation of Navitan Fast Blue S5R by P. aeru-
ginosa has been proposed, as shown in Fig. 2.
