Abstract   
Sixty -three local white -rot fungi were isolated from soil and wood samples on potato dextrose 
agar (PDA). All these isolates were screened for their ability to degrade 4 textile azo dyes; Ponceau 
2R (C.I. 16450), Orange G (C.I. 16230), Direct Blue 71 (C.I . 34140) and Biebrich Scarlet (C.I. 
26905). Out of 40 isolates that gave positive results, only 1 promising isolate which completely 
degrades all 4 dyes in the minimum amount of time was selected for further investigation. This 
isolate was sourced from Uni versity Putra Malaysia (UPM) Serdang campus. The isolate was 
tentatively identified as Coriolopsis  sp. Strain arf5 based on the analysis of the internal transcribed 
spacer (ITS) region. Nutritional studies on defined solid medium showed that this isolate w as only 
able to degrade the 4 azo dyes under nitrogen -limiting conditions and an additional carbon source 
(glucose) need to be added to provide sufficient energy for the degradation to occur. Various 
parameters were optimized.

Introduction   
The modern world use synthetic dyes to replace natural dyes, especially in textile industry. 
However the present of synthetic dyes give rise to a new set of problems. The most obvious 
problem  is aesthetic pollution of water ways caused by the presence of dyes leached from textile 
factories since they are visible even at low concentrations (Banat et al. 1996). In addition, the 
presence of dyes could also potentially reduce the amount of sunligh t reaching the bottom of rivers 
and lakes and thus affects the ability of aquatic plants to carry out photosynthesis (Banat et al. 
1996, Torres et al. 2003, Wesenberg et al. 2003). This affects the availability of oxygen in the water 
to other aquatic organ isms (Yesilada et al. 2003). They also produce potentially carcinogenic 
aromatic compound from partial cleavage of azoic dye groups. Current azo dye removal methods 
usually involve physical and/or chemical treatments. These methods have many disadvantages.  
Chemical treatments produce large amount of chemical sludge which poses disposal problems 
(Supaka et al. 2004). Physical treatments are also very expensive due to the high operating Mycosphere 7 (5): 560–569 (2016 )  www.mycosphere.org  ISSN 2077 7019

    2 expenses to produce and regenerate activated carbon (Shen et al. 1992). F or all these reasons, 
biological treatments such as utilization of biodegradative ability of bacteria and fungi are being 
investigated as a viable and cost effective alternative. Fungi such as Phanerochaete chrysoporium  
and Tinctoporia sp., both belonging to the ligninolytic white -rot group, are among the first to 
demonstrate the ability to degrade azo dyes (Awaluddin et al. 2001). However, most published 
research, including those that have been done in Malaysia have focused on these temperate species 
(Awaluddin et al. 2001, Levin et al. 2004) while the rich fungal bio diversity available in Malaysia 
await investigations.  
 
Materials & Methods   
 
Sampling sites  
Sixty -three samples were collected from soil and wood from various locations in Selangor, 
Kelantan, Terengganu and Perak in Peninsula Malaysia. Samples from soi l had soft and fleshy 
fruiting bodies (mushrooms). Sampling was carried out by scooping out the fruiting bodies with 
some of the surrounding soil underneath it to obtain the whitish mycelia that are growing in the 
soil. Wood samples were rotten wood undern eath and surrounding the fruiting bodies, or pieces of 
rotten tree bark that were covered with white rot fungal mycelia.  
 
Isolation of fungal isolates  
Collected samples were first washed in tap water, and cut into smaller pieces. For soil 
samples, only stipes of fruiting bodies and attached mycelia in the soil were used. Cleaned and cut 
samples were immersed in 5.25 % sodium hypochlorite CloroxTM for approximately 15 min.  
Samples were gently shaken to remove excess disinfectant solution before placed on  Potato 
Dextrose Agar (PDA). Once white -rot mycelia (whitish or yellow -brown, flat or cotton -like 
mycelia radiating out of original sample, with no spore -forming structure) were confirmed, they 
were cut and subcultured on new PDA plates. This process was r epeated until a pure culture was 
obtained.  
 
Screening for fungal isolates with azo dye -degrading ability  
Screening of isolated white -rot fungal cultures for azo dye -degrading ability was carried out 
in nitrogen deficient defined medium containing modifi ed Kirk’s Basal Medium (KBM) (Tien & 
Kirk 1988, Shin et al. 2002) with added azo dye. The full composition of the modified KBM is as 
follows; 10.1 g/L glucose monohydrate, 2 g/L L -Asparagine, 0.2 g/L KH 2PO 4, 0.05 g/L 
MgSO 4.7H 2O, 0.01 g/L CaCl 2.2H 2O and 0.1  ml/L of stock trace mineral solution. The stock trace 
elements (TE) solution contains 30 g/L MgSO 4.7H 2O, 10 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L MnSO 4.H2O, 1 g/L 
FeSO 4.7H 2O, 1 g/L ZnSO 4.7H 2O, 0.82 g/L CaCl 2, 0.1 g/L CuSO 4.5H 2O, 0.1 g/L NaMoO 4.2H 2O, 
0.1 g/L H 3BO 3 and 1 g/L EDT A. For screening purposes, the L -asparagine was omitted to obtain 
nitrogen deficient condition and replaced with 0.2 g/L azo dyes. Four different azo dyes were used 
for screening, including Ponceau 2R (C.I. 16450; Acid Red 26), Orange G (C.I. 16230; Acid o range 
10), Direct Blue 71 (C.I. 34140) and Biebrich Scarlet (C.I. 26905; Acid Red 66). The screening 
medium was adjusted to pH 5.0, and poured into Petri dishes. The culture plates were observed 
qualitatively for 21 days for growth and formation of translu cent decolourized zones around the 
growing mycelia which indicates the presence of azo dye -degrading ability.  
 
ITS region sequencing  
DNA was extracted from fresh mycelia grown for 7 days on Potato Dextrose Broth. PCR 
was performed in a 50 µL mix contain ing 1.5 µM of each primer, 200 µM of each deoxynucleotide 
triphosphate, 10X reaction buffer and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase. The internal transcribe spacer 
(ITS) region from the genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using the following primers; ITS1 -F  
(5’-CTT GGT CAT TTA GAG GAA GTA A -3’) (Gardes & Brunes 1993) and ITS4 (5’ - TCC TCC 
GCT TAT TGA TAT GC -3’) (White et al. 1990).  PCR was performed under the following     3 conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min 25 s; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 35 s, 55 °C for 5 5 s, 
and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Cycle sequencing was subsequently

performed with the Big Dye terminator kit (Perkin -Elmer Applied Biosystems) as recommended by 
the manufacturer. Sequence data were initially recorded and edited using CHROM AS Version 1.45. 
The resultant 772 bases were compared with the GenBank database using the Blast server at NCBI 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The ITS region sequences for this isolate have been 
deposited in GenBank under the following accession num ber EU863194.  
 
Phylogenetic analysis  
A multiple alignment of 20 ITS region sequences closely matches Strain arf5 retrieved from 
GenBank and aligned using ClustalW (Thompson et al. 1994) with the PHYLIP output option. 
Alignment positions with gaps were e xcluded from the calculations. A phylogenetic tree was 
constructed using PHYLIP, version 3.573 [J. Q. Felsenstein, PHYLIP —phylogeny inference 
package, version 3.573, Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 
(http://evolution.genetics.w ashington.edu/phylip.html)], with Rhizopus oryzae  strain FSU 6022 
EU484218 as the outgroup in the cladogram. Evolutionary distance matrices for the 
neighborjoining/UPGMA method were computed using the DNADIST algorithm program. The 
program reads in nucleot ide sequences and writes an output file containing the distance matrix. The 
model of nucleotide substitution is from Jukes and Cantor (1969). Phylogenetic tree was inferred by 
using the neighbor -joining method of Saitou and Nei (1987). With each algorithm,  confidence 
levels for individual branches within the tree were checked by repeating the PHYLIP analysis with 
1,000 bootstraps (Felsenstein 1985) by the SEQBOOT program in the PHYLIP package. Majority 
rule (50%) consensus trees were constructed using a fam ily of consensus tree methods called the 
Ml methods (Margush & McMorris 1981).  
 
Analysis of carbon and nitrogen limitation on azo dye degradation  
The media used for carbon and nitrogen utilization studies were based on KBM (Shin et al. 
2002) with slight  modification to suit this study as shown in Table 1. The 4 azo dyes tested were; 
Ponceau 2R, Orange G, Direct Blue 71 and Bierich Scarlet. Glucose monohydrate was omitted in 
the media used for the study on the degradation of azo dyes in carbon -limiting co nditions. 
However, L -asparagine was used as the original nitrogen source and it was known that amino acid 
could also be the source of carbon for fungi. Therefore, an inorganic nitrogen source, NH 4Cl was 
also used in place of L -asparagine. No nitrogen sourc e was added in the medium used to study 
nitrogen limiting conditions.      4 Results and Discussion  
 
Isolation and screening of fungal isolates  
Sixty -three local white -rot fungi were successfully isolated from 118 samples and cultured on 
PDA. Out of 63 isol ates only 40 isolates showed positive result with varying degree of degradation 
against the azo dyes tested including Ponceau 2R, Orange G, Direct Blue 71 and Biebrich Scarlet. 
The highest degree of azo dyes degradation was observed in isolate S17 -UPM

which completely degraded Ponceau 2R and Basal Scarlet in 9 days, as well as Orange G and 
Direct Blue 71 in 8 days (Fig. 1). This isolate was isolated from Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang 
Campus, Selangor.  
 
Identification of fungal isolates  
Base on ITS analysis, isolate S17 -UPM is assigned as Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5. A high 
bootstrap v alue (86.6 %) is seen when Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5 is associated to Coriolopsis 
polyzona  strain Dai9495 and Dai9468 indicating that the phylogenetic relationship between the 
species is strong (Fig. 2).  Most of the reported dye degrading fungi are whit e rot fungi (Chagas & 
Durrant 2001, Selvam et al. 2003, Máximo & Costa -Ferreira 2004, Novotný et al. 2004, Sathiya et 
al. 2007, Srinivasan & Murthy 2009). This feature is probably due to the ability of white rot fungi 
to degrade a wide range of ligninolyti c compounds (Christie 2001).  
 
Effects of carbon limitation and nitrogen limitation on azo dye degradation   
The degree of degradation and the time required for the fungus to degrade the azo dye tested 
were summarized in Table 2 and 3.It was showed that, no translucent decolourized zones were 
observed in Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5 culture that was grown on carbon -limiting conditions with 
Lasparagine or NH 4Cl as the nitrogen source. The presence of additional nitrogen sources, whether 
organic or inorganic was shown to repress the ligninolytic system of the white -rot fungi (Zeikus 
1981, Wesenberg et al. 2003). We showed that, among the 4 azo dyes tested, Coriolopsis sp. strain 
arf5 was able to degrade Direct Blue 71 even under nitrogen sufficient conditions,  with faster     5 degradation rate in the presence of NH 4Cl as the sole nitrogen source instead of L -asparagine. In 
contrast, complete or nearly complete degradation of all the azo dyes tested was observed under 
nitrogen -limiting conditions. Máximo et al. (2003 ) reported that P. chrysosporium , Ganoderma sp., 
I. lacteus , P. magnoliea , Rigidoporus sp., T. versicolor  and Geotrichum sp. carry out azo dye 
degradation under nitrogen -limiting conditions while Kapdan et al. (2000) showed nitrogen 
concentrations determin ed the decolourization performance of Coriolous versicolor . 
Nitrogenlimiting conditions are also responsible to trigger the production of ligninolytic enzymes in 
secondary metabolism (Wesenberg et al. 2003). Under this condition, the azo dyes serve as a so urce  
of nitrogen for the fungus.

fungi. Toh et al. (2003) reported an unidentified white -rot fungus isolated from Singapore was able 
to degrade azo dyes in nitrogen -rich medium with the degradation rates comparable to P. 
chrysosporium . This is not the case for Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5 which is ab le to grow better in 
complete medium compared to media supplemented with azo dyes as sole carbon source. This 
suggests that the 4 azo dyes tested served as poor sources of carbon for growth and Coriolopsis sp. 
strain arf5 requires additional source of carb on to degrade the azo dyes. This observation adds 
further evidence to the claim that azo dye degradation occurs during secondary metabolism and that 
the ligninolytic enzyme system functions optimally when other more readily metabolized carbon 
sources are a vailable (Zeikus 1981).  
 
Effects of temperature on azo dye degradation  
To determine the optimum temperature for azo dye degradation, Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5 
was grown on Ponceau 2R, Orange G and Direct Blue 71 for 48 hours and on Biebrich Scarlet fo r 
96 hours (Fig. 3 to 6). Using one -way ANOVA analysis we showed that the degradation rates of all 
4 azo dyes tested were significantly affected by the different incubation temperature (P < 0.05). 
Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5 have a general azo dye degradat ion optimum temperature between room 
temperature to 35 ºC. This is similar to the optimum temperature for degrading Solar golden yellow 
R by Schizophyllum commune IBL-06 (Asgher et al. 2008). Relatively high degradation optimum 
temperature is potentially a dvantageous especially in dye effluents treatment because less effort is 
required to remove the heat produced by the fungi metabolism.  
Results from one -way ANOVA showed that Biebrich Scarlet degradation was only slightly 
affected by the tested temperature s (P = 0.001). Cultures incubated at room temperature, 30, 35, 40 
and 45°C (Fig. 6) have similar degradation rates where very little degradation occurred with a final 
decolourization percentage of only 22.24%, 24.32%, 14.11% 14.25% and 14.35% at room 
tempe rature, 30, 35, 40 and 45°C respectively. However, this pattern of degradation does not apply 
to the three other dyes tested although the effects of different incubation temperatures were 
statistically significant (P < 0.001). The degradation rates are als o relatively higher at room 
temperature and 30°C for Orange G, Ponceau 2R and Direct Blue 71 on day 2 (Fig. 3 to 5). 
According to results from one -way ANOVA, the various temperatures tested have quite significant 
effect on all four azo dye degradation espe cially Ponceau 2R due to its smallest P value and highest 
R2 value (P < 0.0001, R2=0.9893).   
Based on the DT 50 analysis conducted on a series of temperature (30, 35 and 40 °C) (Table 
4), Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5 was shown to efficiently degrade Orange  G followed by Direct Blue 
71 and Ponceau 2R. The lowest degradation rate was observed in Biebrich Scarlet which was 
degraded less than 90% after 120 hours of incubation.

Effects of different initial pH on azo dye degradation  
The effects of different initial medium pH on azo dye degradation by Coriolopsis sp. strain 
arf5 were investigated. Using one -way ANOVA, we showed  that there is no significant difference 
observed in the degradation of Orange G, Direct Blue 71 and Biebrich Scarlet after 48 hours of 
incubation (P > 0.05). However, a slight difference in the degradation rate of Ponceau 2R (P <  
0.05) was observed. We r ecorded a slightly higher Ponceau 2R degradation rate at the initial pH of 
4.5 while the lowest degradation rate was recorded at the initial pH of 5.0. Even though the initial 
pH does not significantly affect the degradation rate of the dyes tested, we sho wed that the 
degradation still occurs. This proved that Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5 is able to degrade Orange G, 
Direct Blue 71, Ponceau 2R and Biebrich Scarlet within a wide range of pH. Previous report by 
Tekere et al. (2001) has showed that degradation of Poly R478 by T. versicolor , Trametes pocas , 
Trametes cingulata , Pycnoporus sanguineus  and D. concentric  was affected by the initial pH of the 
media used. Study by Kapdan et al. (2000) also demonstrated that optimum degradation rate of 
Everzol Turquoise Blue by C. versicolor  was achieved at pH 4.5.  
The final pH of the medium was recorded after 48 hours of incubation. We showed that the 
initial pH of the medium used for the degradation study decrease after 48 hours of incubation 
(Table 5). This suggests a cid was produced during the azo dyes degradation by the fungus. Similar 
observation was reported by Tekere et al. (2001) in white -rot fungi suggesting that the fungi 
produced organic acids during secondary metabolism thus causing the gradual reduction of t he pH. 
Another possible explanation is that some fungi are able to use medium buffer such as 
citratephosphate and tartrate buffers as their alternative carbon source during azo dyes degradation 
(Swamy & Ramsay 1999). However, this is not the case for sodiu m acetate buffer. It was reported 
that, fungi were unable to utilize sodium acetate buffer as their alternative carbon source (Swamy & 
Ramsay 1999).  
Based on the DT 50 values of Table 6, Direct Blue 71 was the dye that degraded fastest with 
smallest values  for all of the initial pH, followed by Ponceau 2R, Orange G and Biebrich Scarlet. 
The uninoculated abiotic controls and killed -mycelia controls did not show significant azo dye 
degradation.  
In conclusion, 63 white -rot fungi were isolated from various loc ations in Malaysia Peninsular 
and screened for their ability to degrade the azo dyes; Ponceau 2R, Orange G, Direct      10 Blue 71 and Biebrich Scarlet. Out of the 63 fungal isolates, we selected a strain identified as 
Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5 based on its azo  dyes degradation rate. We showed the fungus was only 
able to degrade azo dyes in nitrogen -limiting conditions. This suggests that the fungus is able to 
utilize azo dyes as sole nitrogen source. The effect of temperature on degradation rate by the fungus 
is one of the parameter studied. We showed that Coriolopsis sp. strain arf5 was able to degrade azo 
dyes efficiently between room temperature to 40 ºC. This suggests that the fungus has potential for 
pollution treatment application especially in South East Asia.
