Abstract:  The initial reduction steps of nitroaroma tic compounds on the surface of metallic 
iron have been studied theoretically using nitrobenzene (NB) as a representative of nitroaromatic compounds. The quantum chem ical cluster approximation within the 
semiempirical Neglect of Diatomic Differential Overlap for Metal Compounds method was 
applied to model the Fe(110) crystallographic surface, taken as a representative reactive surface for granular iron.  Th is surface was modeled as a  39-atom two-layer metal cluster 
with rigid geometry. The associative and dissociative adsorption of nitrobenzene was considered.  Based on our quantum chemical analysis,  we suggest that the direct electron 
donation from the metal surface into the π
* orbital of NB is a decisi ve factor responsible for 
subsequent transformation of the  nitro group .  Molecularly adsorbed NB interacts with metal 
iron exclusively through nitro moiety oxygens which occupy  tri-coordinated positions on surface The charge transfer from metal to NB of approximately 2 atomic units destablizes 
the nitro group. As a result, the first dissociation of the N-O bond  goes through a relatively 
low activation barrier. The adsorbed nitrosobenzene is predicted to be a stable surface species, though still quiet labile.  Keywords:  Nitroaromatic compounds, Semiempirical method NDDO/MC, Nitrobenzene

Introduction 
The reduction of nitro aromatic compounds (NACs) is of considerable interest because NACs are 
common groundwater contaminants  and reduction reactions can play a central role in their 
environmental fate or cleanup. Sources of NAC contaminants include  activities associated with the 
production or utilization of explosives, dyes, agrichemicals and pesticides. 
Zero-valent iron (ZVI) has been demonstrated to participate directly or indirectly in 
environmentally beneficial reduc tion reactions affecting the transformation of a variety of common 
groundwater contaminants, including chlorinated so lvents, heavy metals, uranium, nitrate, and 
nitroaromatic compounds [1]. 
The reduction of nitro-organic compounds also may be affected by non-ferrous metals or by 
surface catalyzed reactions involving ferrous iron (Fe+2) as the electron donor. Agrawal and Tratnyek 
[2] describe the reduction of nitrobenzene on ZVI, reporting rapid reduction to aniline (aminobenzene) 
with the transient occurrence of nitrosobenzene. 
The detailed molecular mechanism of the NACs reduction by Fe(0) is not  yet fully understood.   
Formally, the overall nitro-to-amino reduction is a  six-electron-transfer reduction half-reaction:  
    Ar-NO 2  + 6e- + 6H+ → Ar-NH 2 + 2H 2O  
where ‘Ar’ represents an aromatic structure, though it could also represent an aliphatic or N-
heterocyclic structure. However, the actual reduct ion of the nitro to amino group by iron comprises a 
variety of pathways including coordination by iron centers, transformation of nitro group, condensation of NACs, etc. The first 2e
- transfer step in the nitro reduction reaction is proposed to be 
the formation of nitroso group [3]. 
Ar-NO 2  + 2e- + 4H+ → Ar-NO + 2H 2O  . 
This step merits careful consideration as it describes the initial reaction mechanism as well as the 
generation of products fo r subsequent reactions. 
To our knowledge, the reduction of NACs by zero-valent iron has never been studied by means of 
quantum chemical methods.  Among the very few such studies devoted to the adsorption of much 
smaller systems on the iron surface, the following works seem to be representative.  
To study the atomic hydrogen adsorption on the Fe(110) surface an extended Hückel tight-binding 
(EHT) method has been applied recently [4]. The unit cell geometry was optimized using the atom-superposition-and-electron-delocalization-molecular-orbital (ASED-MO) model core potential.  This 
work was inspired by the wide interest in studying the hydrogen-metal interaction due to its 
importance for catalysis and material science .  The metal surface was approximated by periodic, 
seven-layer slab using the 87-atom unit cell.  The advantage of this approach is its transparency and 
simplicity which, for example, allows one to avoid the convergence problem associated with the Hartree–Fock or Density Functional Theory (DFT) me thods. This EHT study is closely related to the 
recent ab initio  calculation of the H
2 adsorption on a 32-atom cluster [5].  
Mortenson et al. [6] applied DFT periodic slab calc ulations to study nitrogen adsorption  in order 
to gain some insight into microscopic reaction steps for activation of N 2 on the Fe(111), (100), and Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2002 , 3 803
(110) faces.  To model these faces, the six-, four-, and three-layer slabs were used.  Unit cells contain 
12, 10, and 9 atoms, respectively.  Activation of N 2 by Fe was also considered in the cluster DFT 
calculations using two-atom iron clusters [7].  
Applying first-principle, quantum chemical approaches to study of the NACs adsorption on the 
iron surface presents numerous computational challenges.  The system requires a top layer of cluster (or surface unit cell) that is at least equal in  size to the NAC molecule. This means that the 
corresponding surface unit cell or cluster top layer s hould be even larger than that used in the EHT 
study of the H/Fe(110) system [4].  For the first- principle periodic approaches the requirements are 
even stricter since the unit cell should be further extended to exclude artificial adsorbate-adsorbate 
interaction arisen in such methods for small surface unit cells. 
The aim of this work is to obtain some insight into the process of the NACs adsorption on the 
metal iron by means of the Neglect of Diatomic Differential Overlap for Metal Compounds 
(NDDO/MC) semi-empirical method [8]. This method has been parameterized to reproduce the 
experimental geometry and binding energy for molecules like HNO, HNO
2, FeO and FeN2 [9]. It 
makes this approach reliable for the study of the nitro group interaction with zero-valent iron despite 
the approximations used in NDDO/MC. As a prot otype NAC we considered nitrobenzene (NB). 
Unprotected metallic iron certainly will oxidize or corrode under aquifer conditions to form a 
variety of iron oxides, hydroxides, or other mi nerals, depending on water chemistry. Thus, nitro 
contaminants under field conditions would encounter clean iron for a very short period or time and/or 
at a very limited surface area. Also under investigat ion are the interactions of the nitro contaminants 
with the products of iron corrosion in the presence of ferrous iron which would be supplied by iron corrosion. Characterization of the reactions at metal iron surfaces establishes a benchmark for 
comparative purposes.  
The Fe(110) crystal face is chosen to be the actual  surface on which the NB reduction is realized.  
In case of bcc crystal lattice, this face is the closes t packed and the most stable.  Because of that it is 
worth to expect that the real granular iron surface contains the high percent of the (110) ‘patches’.    
Method 
In this work all calculations have been perfo rmed in the cluster approximation using NDDO/MC 
semiempirical Hamiltonian [8]. The NDDO/MC method is based on the approximation of zero diatomic differential overlap which results in neglecting of 3-, 4- and part of 2-center two-electron 
integrals to be appeared in the Fock matrix [10]. Retained two-electron integrals are calculated  
explicitly with Slater-type orbitals. Despite that NDDO/MC is a much faster method than ab initio  one 
due to its quadratic dependence on basis set versus quartic one for the latter. 
In order to determine how well the NDDO/MC method predicts the properties of the nitro 
compounds few simple molecules of this class have  been treated. In Table 1 the bond lengths and 
valence angles calculated by NDDO/MC are listed along with those from experimental data [11,12]. The N-O bond length is predicted with the accuracy of  about 0.02 Å. The  O-N-O  angle  is accurate to Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2002 , 3 804

Cluster model.  To model the Fe(110) surface a two-layer cl uster has been used. It consists of the 
23-atom (‘top’) and 16-atom second layer and has the C 2v symmetry (Figure 1). The boundary for the 
top layer was chosen in such a way to form an equivalent hexagonal surrounding for every ‘active’ atom (Fe1-Fe9). The second layer brings additional  4 atoms to the coordination sphere of the active 
atoms. Thus the cluster contains just ‘surface’ at oms having reduced first coordination sphere of 10 
atoms. Below this cluste r will be referred as Fe
39.  
Since the metal iron possesses large magnetic mome nt (2.2 spins per atom for bulk Fe [13,14]) a 
non-trivial question arises concerning spin state to be assumed for the cluster under consideration. For 
the 39-atom cluster considered the spin multiplicity is chosen in the following way. First, we analyze 
the  wave function  associated with  the  Huckel-type  Hamiltonian  to find out  the  one-electron  states  Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2002 , 3 805

corresponding to the 3d band.  Then all the one-electr on states were populated starting from the lowest 
until the 3d band becomes completely occupied. At the same time we keep as many unpaired electrons 
as possible to form the highest spin multiplicity st ate. It appears that this state corresponds to the 
multiplicity of 105 (S=52). This multiplicity corr esponds to the magnetization of 2.67 spins per atom 
on average. It agrees fairly well with the first-pr inciple theoretical predictions of 2.57 [15] and 2.65 
[16] for the (110) surface of bcc Fe. The unre stricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) calculation for Fe 39 with this 
multiplicity gives the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for the al pha-spin electrons having 
the energy of -4.02 eV. Such energy is close to the electron work function for iron (4.5 eV [11]). Performing the SCF calculation for Fe
39 we faced the problem of slow convergence (which sometimes 
takes thousands of iterations to be complete d) along with the broken symmetry. The latter is 
manifested by differences in charge and spin (of the Spin-Density-Wave type) for symmetrical centers 
of the cluster (Table 2). The question arises if it can be accepted as physically reasonable solution. As 
it will be shown below the nitroaromatics-Fe0 interaction is rather strong and results particularly in 
substantial charge transfer from metal toward the nitro group. The adsorption species formed reduce 
the symmetry of substrate. So the charge distribut ion on the 'naked' metal cluster seems to have a 
negligible effect on the NACs adsorption on Fe0 and especially on reduction of nitro aromatics.

Surprisingly the spin contamination of UHF function is rather moderate. For example for the naked 
cluster the <S2> value is about 2756.04 which is very close to the exact value of 2756 for 2S+1=105. 
All calculations in this work have been performed for this multiplicity.  
 Results 
Considering the interaction of NACs with zer o-valent iron some predictions concerning the 
mechanism of the nitro group reduction can be put forward a priori  on base of electron structure of 
NACs itself. In Figure 2 the HOMO and lowest unoc cupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) are plotted for 
nitrobenzene. As seen from Figure 2 HOMO is localized on the benzene ring unlike LUMO which is 
the π
* orbital delocalized over the benzene ring and nitr o group. Because of that one can expect the N-
O bond to be weaken (or even broken) upon the electron transfer into the NACs.  
The adsorption of NB on the Fe 39 cluster has been treated at the UHF level. It is evident that NB 
can interact with iron surface forming either planar or upright adsorption species. One could anticipate 
that planar complexes are likely to be formed on surface by analogy with π-bonded structure of 
ferrocene. We have tested both ways of interac tions and found that upright-bonded species are more 
than 80 kcal/mol preferred. The geometry optimization (geometry of cluster itself and the NB ring 
were kept frozen) of NB on the cluster yields the molecularly adsorbed NB which is shown in Figure 
3A  (this  structure  is  designated  as  A).   The  modification  of  the  NB  geometry  upon  associative

adsorption on Fe 39 confirmed the idea about leading role of nitro group in the NACs reduction by iron. 
It appeared that the NB ring forms an angle of 36 degree with respect to its upright position (Figure 
3A). Another prediction arisen from the LUMO structure of NB was also confirmed: the N-O bonds 
become substantially elongated (1.56 for adsorbed NB vs. 1.26 Å for isolated NB).  Otherwise, the N-
C bond for A is more than 0.1 Å shorter than that of isolated NB. These changes seem to be 
determined by transfer of almost 2 electrons from cl uster toward nitro group (Table 3). And as it might 
be anticipated the charge density transferred is loca lized mostly on oxygen atoms. The spin density is 
also transferred into NB but in contrast to the charge density is delocalized over the whole molecule. 
When adsorbed on Fe(110) the NB molecule procee ds in fact as a triplet-state charge-transfer 
intermediate. 
Taking into account substantial weakening of N-O bonds for adsorbed NB here comes the 
suggestion about subsequent modification of NB on iron surface. One may predict that one or both N-
O bonds are to be broken to form NB-reduced species. In order to model the dissociation of nitro 
group on iron surface the potential ener gy profile has been calculated for a number of N-O’ distances 
(O’ here and below designates runaway oxygen atom). Along this reaction coordinate the geometry of 
NB was optimized keeping above-mentioned geomet ry restrictions. The saddle point (Figure 3B) 
obtained relates to nitrobenzene on Fe 39 with almost broken N-O bond (2.08 Å). This species will be 
referred to as B.  The energy minimum beyond the barrier (it is designated as C) corresponds to the 
nitrosobenzene (NS) molecule and atomic oxygen ad sorbed on the surface (Figure 3C). The potential 
energy profile is plotted in Figure 4a. The star ting point corresponds to nitrobenzene which is 
associatively adsorbed on surface. The height of barrier for the N-O bond cleavage on Fe(110) is estimated to be just 6.0 kcal/mol when going from A to C  species. The dissociative-adsorption species

is shifted to the reductive form of nitrobenzene. For comparison in Figure 4b there is plotted similar 
energy profile calculated for dissociation of gaseous NB anion in triplet state: 
NB2- ↔ NS- + O- 
Such charge and spin was chosen to model surface NB species which are the most close to this anion. 
For this anion a barrier for N-O bond cleavage is estimated to be about 50 kcal/mol and products lie 
substantially higher than the NB2-. This finding shows a crucial role which zero-valent iron surface 
plays in the reduction of nitrobenzene.  
The products of the NB dissociation on Fe(110) de serves to be considered in more detail. The 
oxygen coming out from broken nitro group occupies the 3-fold position (Figure 3C) with Fe-O 
distances ranging from about 1.6 to 1.9 Å. Such Fe-O bond lengths are quite close to that of the FeO 
molecule (experimental Fe-O distance is 1.57 Å [17]). As can be seen from Figure 3C the 
nitrosobenzene moiety is bound to surface mostly th rough oxygen center. In order to find out how 
isolated oxygen atom and nitroso benzene adsorb on iron surface we performed investigation of their 
interactions with the same cluster. The nitrosobenzene (NS) adsorption species is shown in Figure 5. It 
was optimized using restrictions similar to those for NB, i.e. keeping frozen the benzene ring and metal cluster geometry. Unlike the nitroso moiety of NB on Fe
39 the isolated NS molecule binds to 
surface through oxygen and nitrogen as well (as shown in Figure 5). The other changes reflect the same trend: the N-O bond becomes substantia lly elongated while the C-N bond is shortened upon 
adsorption. The slope of benzene ring is about 54 de gree from the upright position. There is also a 
substantial electron density transfer (1.353 units) toward adsorbate.

The oxygen adsorption on Fe(110) surface is modeled by structure shown in Figure 6. The oxygen 
occupies the 3-fold position just like the runaway oxygen moiety of NB on surface. To check how the 
oxygen adsorption depends on cluster site chosen we calculated the oxygen adsorption at the center of 
second (smaller) layer of Fe 39. The oxygen is stabilized in the 3-fold position having Fe-O distances of 
1.618, 1.752 and 1.818 Å.  The adsorption energy insignificantly deviates from that obtained for oxygen shown in Figure 6 by small value of 0.05 eV. It is interesting that E
ads is of the same magnitude 
order as the energy of dissociation for FeO molecule which is 4.2 eV [17]. This fact seems to be an additional confirmation that the electron transfer in to oxygen is the major factor responsible for the 
adsorption energy with oxygen-containing adsorbate. 
Comparing the sum of adsorption energies for separated NS and oxygen atom from one side and 
E
ads for NB(C)/Fe 39 from the other one can see that the former is twice as much. We suggest that this 
difference is determined by the Coulomb repul sion between nitroso and oxygen moieties of 
NB(C)/Fe 39. This repulsion energy is 5.2 eV if one assumes that its largest contribution comes from the 
oxygen and nitroso group of NB(C)/Fe 39. If one subtracts this value from sum of the O and NS 
adsorption energies the latter becomes equal to  7.3 eV that agrees fairly well with E ads of 6.7 eV for 
NB(C)/Fe 39. This Coulomb repulsion between the oxygen and nitrosobenzene could be a driving force 
which might cause their migration on surface after dissociation of NB.

Conclusions  
The results obtained allow us to suggest the following mechanism for the initial steps of NACs 
reduction on iron surface. First when the nitro group starts to interact with metal iron surface an 
electron transfer from metal into NACs takes place. It is caused by high electron-withdrawing ability of nitro group.  This results in substantial elong ation of the N-O bonds because the transferred electron 
density goes most likely into the antibonding N-O part of low-lying unoccupied orbitals of NACs. This 
molecularly adsorbed NACs with labile oxygen center s of the nitro group represents a precursor state 
for subsequent transformation on surface. The second most probable step is a decomposition of the N-Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2002 , 3 812
O bond followed by the nitrosobenzene formation. The activation energy for the nitro group 
decomposition is estimated to be small enough (at l east much less than the NB desorption energy) to 
allow kinetically this reaction to proceed. Moreove r, the energetic preference of nitrosobenzene and 
oxygen on surface over the NB adsorbed makes th e nitro group decomposition equilibrium to be 
strongly shifted toward reduction products. Despite that we didn’t study in this work the decomposition of nitroso group on Fe(110) and it seems reasonable to expect that this reaction 
proceeds the same way as in case of nitro group. Th is prediction is based on that (i) the LUMO (which 
has π
* symmetry) structure of nitrosobenzene is exactly the same as that of NB, and  (ii) the nitroso 
group of NS on Fe(110) is substantially elongated.   And finally, we suggest that the NS species on 
Fe(110) is as stable as NB ones since the desorption en ergy of nitroso benzene is estimated to be  close 
to that of NB.  
Taking into account the strong electrostatic repulsion of NB-dissociation surface species such as 
atomic oxygen and NS adsorbed we suggest that there should be a strong pH dependence of the 
dissociation rate. The proton would decrease this repulsion when atta cked nitrogen and substituted the 
O- species coming out of N-O bond. The charge on ni trogen of the adsorbed NS (C structure) is 
calculated to be larger than that of oxygen. This  is an additional argument supporting the suggestion 
about protonation.
