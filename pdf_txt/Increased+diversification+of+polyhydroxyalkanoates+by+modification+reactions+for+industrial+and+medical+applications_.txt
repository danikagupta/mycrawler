Introductio n 
In recent years there is a continuous search for different 
biopolymers as they have wide range of applications in 
different sectors like packaging, building materials, consumer 
products and many more. The currently available biopolymers 
in ma rket are polyglycolic acid (PGA), polyhydroxyalkonate 
(PHA) and polylactic acid (PLA). Others polymers such as 
exopolysaccharide, inorganic polyanhydrides, polyesters, and 
polyamides are also coming in the forefront [1, 2, 3]. The first 
biodegradable polym er identified was polyhydroxyalkonates, 
which was isolated from bacteria such as Alcaligenes latus , 
Ralstonia eutropha , Azotobacter beijerinckii  etc.,. The main 
role of this intracellular polymer is that it can act as carbon 
and energy reserve material whi ch was produced under 
nitrogen, phosphate, or oxygen limited conditions pha -6 [4, 5].  
Under stress conditions energy from this reserve material is 
utilized for its metabolic activities. Depending upon certain 
growth conditions PHA is made of either short -chain length or 
medium -chain length or both forms.  
Another important polymer other than intracellular 
polymers is extracellular polymers. Certain bacteria produce 
extracellular polymers known as exopolysaccharides (EPS) 
which are released outside the cell u nder stressed condition. 
These are mainly produced as a defense material against 
dessication, high salinity and toxic environment.   
Exopolysaccharides are high -molecular -weight polymers 
which are mainly composed of sugar residues. Both these 
polymers are identified as the potential biopolymers that could 
replace synthetic polymers due to its biodegradability and 
biocompatibility property. Numerous microorganisms such as 
Azotobacter chroococcum strain 6B, Azotobacter beijerinckii  
WDN -01, Ralstonia eutropha  and Bacillus  sp. can produce 
both PHAs and EPS [6, 7, 8].   
The production of biodegradable polymers on a large 
scale is limited because of expensive raw materials, substrate 
composition, fermentation conditions and high recovery cost. 
According to Halami 2008 [9], about 50% of production cost 
is utilized for the cost of carbon source. Hence the ideal way 
to reduce the polymer production cost is to replace expensive 
carbon source with cheap raw materials. Currently a lot of 
research is going on using agro - industrial wastes such as palm 
oil, whey, corn and cassava residues, olive oil mill effluents, 
sugarcane molasses and paper mill waste as the carbon source 
rather than refined organic substrates [10]. An added 
advantage in utilizing waste raw materials as carbon source is 
recycling of agro -industrial wastes. Similarly the recycling of 
waste generated from biopolymer production is also 
economical due to its biodegradablility  [11, 12].  In the current 
study wheat bran, rice bran, molasses and sago liquid wast e 
are used for production of both PHA and EPS from the same 
organism.

ABSTRACT  
Currently many bacteria have be en exploited for production of biopolymers for various 
industrial applications. The need for biopolymers has been increasing constantly along 
with increase in human needs. In the present study two important biopolymers - edo 
polymer (PHA) and exopolymer (EP S) was extracted and characterized from the Bacillus  
sp. 2 -11. The ability of Bacillus  sp.2-11 to produce PHA was identified by simple and 
rapid Sudan black B staining method. Similarly the presence of exopolysaccharides was 
identified by Alcian Blue stain ing method. The ability of the organism to utilize cheap 
substrates as carbon source for polyhydroxyalkonates (PHA) and exopolysaccharide 
(EPS) production was determined. Rice bran, wheat bran, molasses and sago liquid 
wastes were supplemented as carbon su bstrate in nitrogen free production medium. The 
most suitable carbon source was sago liquid waste as it showed 42.15% and 50.80% PHA 
and EPS yield respectively. It was also observed that PHA yield was growth associated 
whereas EPS production was observed a t the late exponential phase. Both FT -IR and GC -
MS analysis confirmed the presence of PHA and EPS in Bacillus sp.2-11.

The excess stain was removed and then rinsed with 96% 
ethanol [14]. Presence of acidic exopolysaccharide in Bacillus 
sp. 2 -11 was determined by alcian blue staining. The 5 -day-
old plate was stained with alcian blue (1.0% (w/v) solutio n in 
95% (v/v) ethanol) followed by carbol -fuchsin as a 
counterstain and observed under a phase -contrast microscope.  
Pre-preparation of solid substrate as carbon source  
All the waste materials used in this study like rice bran, 
wheat bran, molasses and Sa go liquid waste was initially 
processed before using as carbon substrate for production. 
Wheat bran and rice bran were purchased from the local 
market, Salem district of Tamil Nadu, India. It was then sun 
dried for 6 -8 days. Sugar molasses was procured fro m Sugar 
refinery factory, Perambalur district of Tamil Nadu, India. The 
raw molasses was clarified in order to eliminate interference 
from solid residues as described by Roberta Fusconi -a et 
al.2010 [15]. The raw molasses was diluted with distilled 
water ( 1:1) containing a NaH 2PO 4 (final concentration of 1.5 
g/L), autoclaved at 120°C for 30 min and allowed to settle for 
24 h. The liquid phase (clarified molasses) was then separated 
and diluted in distilled water.  The pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 
0.2 and the me dia were autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min. The 
sago liquid waste was obtained from Sago manufacturing unit, 
Salem district of Tamil Nadu, India. The sago liquid waste 
was filtered with cheese cloth and autoclaved for 121°C for 20 
min [16].  
Utilization of wa ste as the sole carbon source  
All the four substrates were added as the carbon source at 
the concentration of 2% to nitrogen free production medium 
comprising of KH 2PO 4  13.3(g/L); MgSO 4 1.3(g/L); Citric acid 
1.7(g/L); trace element solution 10mL/L (FeSO 4.7H 2O 
10(g/L); ZnSO 4.7H 2O 2.25(g/L); CuSO 4.5H 2O 1(g/L); 
MnSO 4.5H 2O 0.5 (g/L); CaCl 2.2H 2O 2 (g/L); Na 2B4O7.10H 2O 
0.23(g/L); (NH 4)6MO 7O24 0.1(g/L); HCl (10mL); pH of the 
medium was adjusted to 7.0 [17]. To the production medium 
1% of 24h grown culture of Bac illus sp.2 -11 was added and 
incubated at 37°C for 48 -72 hours at 150 rpm in an orbital 
shaker.  
Determination of bio mass:  
To determine the bio mass content (DCW: dry cell 
weight) the cells were harvested by centrifugation 13,000 rpm 
for 15 minutes at 4°C. The pellets were re -suspended in 
distilled water, washed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm. Pellets 
were collected aseptically and the dry weight of the pellet was 
measured.  
Extraction and characterization of PHA  
From the production medium after 72 h of incuba tion 
culture broth was withdrawn and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 
15 min. To the pellet 10 mL of sodium hypochlorite was 
added and incubated at 50°C for 1 h for lyses of cells. It was 
then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 30 min and the pellet was 
washed with d istilled water [18,19]. Cell lipids and other 
molecules were extracted from the lysed cells by addition of 5 
mL of 96% ethanol and acetone. Later the pellet was dissolved 
in 10 mL chloroform and incubated overnight at 50°C and 
allowed to dry at room temper ature.  
The cellular PHA content was determined by gas 
chromatography –mass spectrometry  which was carried out at 
The South India Textile Research Association, Coimbatore. 
The analysis was performed using a Trace GC –MS equipped 
with a Thermo GC – Trace ultr a Ver: 5.0, Thermo MS DSQ 
II) column (DB 5 - MS Capillary standard non - polar 
column).The polymer was dissolved in 2 mL of chloroform and 2 mL of methanol and acidified with 3% (v/v) H 2So4and 
heated at 100°C for 3.5 h for depolymerization and 
methanolysis  of polyesters. The sample (1µl) in methanol was 
injected with helium (1mL min−1) as the carrier gas. The 
injector temperature was maintained at 70◦C and the column 
temperature was increased from 260◦C and held at the final 
temperature for 6 minutes. For q uantitative analysis of PHA, 
cell culture was grown as described earlier and cell pellet was 
dried to estimate the dry cell weight (DCW) in units of g/L 
[20][21]. This was calculated to determine the cellular weight 
and accumulation other than PHAs. The pe rcentage of 
intracellular PHA accumulation is estimated as the percentage 
composition of PHA present in the dry cell weight:  
% PHA content recovered= Dry weight of extracted PHA 
(g/L)/Dry cell weight (DCW)(g/L) x 100  The PHA content 
was defined as the rat io of PHA to cell dry weight and 
expressed in percentage.  
Extraction and characterization of exopolysaccharide  
For EPS quantification liquid media was diluted to reduce 
the viscosity, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 
7000 rpm for 20 min. To th e crude supernatant 3 volumes of 
ice cold ethanol was added and incubated overnight at 4°C 
[22]. After incubation, it was again centrifuged at 7000 rpm 
for 20 min. The pellet was again re -extracted with ethanol for 
effective extraction. The obtained pellet  was dialyzed 
(cellulose dialysis tube, molecular weight cutoff 12,000 –
16,000) against distilled water for 48 h (water was changed 
three times each day) to eliminate residual sugars from the 
culture medium. Total carbohydrates were measured by the 
phenol -sulfuric acid method [23] in order to estimate the 
amounts of total, free and capsular EPS produced. The amount 
of EPS was expressed as g L –1 using glucose as standard. The 
bacterial exopolysaccharides was characterized using a 
Fourier transform infrared sp ectrophotometer [24, 25]. One 
part of extract was mixed with ninety nine parts of dried 
potassium bromide (KBr) separately and then compressed to 
prepare a salt disc of 3mm diameter. These discs were 
subjected to IR - spectra measurement in the frequency ra nge 
of 400 and 4000 cm -1  
Result and discussion  
Numerous bacteria have been identified as potent PHA 
and EPS producers, but a combined study on the production of 
endo and exopolymers are limited. In the present work, 
Bacillus sp.2 -11 was identified to pro duce both PHA – 
endopolymer and EPS – exopolymer under nitrogen 
limitation. Rapid screening of PHA was carried out by Sudan 
Black B staining as it a cheap and simple method. On addition 
of Sudan Black stain the colony of Bacillus sp. 2 -11 was 
stained blue black indicating the presence of PHA. Sudan 
Black B staining is a fat -soluble dye which is mainly used for 
staining of neutral triglycerides, lipids and lipoproteins [26]. 
Alcian Blue stain as it is specific to acidic polysaccharides 
[27] was used for the detection of polysaccharides. The 
presence of polysaccharides was observed as the bacillus was 
stainable with Alcian Blue.  
One of the major limitations to the commercial production 
of biodegradable polymers is the lack of inexpensive 
feedstock that can co mpete with conventional thermal plastics. 
Henceforth the selection of suitable carbon substrate is a 
critical factor that determines the overall performance of the 
bacterial fermentation and the cost of the final product [36]. 
Many reports are available re garding the application of cheap 
substrates such as edible oil, cassava waste, oil waste and S. Jenny angel and R. Dhandapani / Elixir Biosciences  96 (2016) 41371 -41375  
 41373  
cardboard pulp waste [28] as carbon source. In the present 
study, the ability of the organism to utilize cheap substrates 
such as Rice bran, wheat bran, molasses a nd sago liquid waste 
as carbon source were assessed. These raw materials were 
selected based on its chemical composition and availability. 
Wheat and rice bran are almost equal in their chemical 
composition containing starch content of 34.0%, fibre 9.2%, 
crude protein 1.4%, free reducing sugar 1.9 % and starch 
content 33.5% , fibre 8.6%, Protein 1.7%, free  reducing sugar 
1.3 % respectively [25,26]. S ugarcane molasses contains high 
amount of carbon 54% and trace amount of vitamins such as 
thiamine, riboflavi n, pyridoxine and niacinamide [27, 28]. 
Sago mills generate both solid and liquid waste during sago 
preparation from tapioca roots. This sago liquid waste also 
contains high starch content of 58.0% and lower amount of 
protein 23% and 11% of lipid [29, 30].  The pre -processed 
waste materials were added to the production medium as a 
sole source of carbon and nitrogen source was excluded to 
create nitrogen limited condition. The bacterial growth was 
assessed by estimating the dry cell weight (DCW) and PHA 
and E PS yield in percentage was also determined 
simultaneously (Fig 1).  
 
As Bacillus is known for its metabolic versatility, it was 
able utilize all the four waste material as carbon source in 
nitrogen limited condition. Bacillus sp.2 -11 produced 
maximum PHA and EPS yield of 42.15% and 50.80% 
respectively using sago liquid waste as carbon source. As 
maximum yield was observed with Sago liquid waste, it was 
considered as the optimum carbon source for both PHA and 
EPS production. This will help in utilizing the liquid waste 
from sago mill in a better way and also in reducing the 
polymer production cost.       
The relationship of the growth rate with the polymer 
production was also studied. The time course of growth with 
PHA accumulation revealed that maximum PHA 
accumulation was attained at the log phase of 2.93 ±g/L and 
biomass dry weight (DCW) of 6.95g/L and reduces as the 
growth reduces. This indicates that PHA accumulation is 
growth associated as reported by Roland Durner  et al ., 2000 
[31]. Certain reports sho w that maximum PHA yield was 
reported in the late exponential phase [32]. The growth study 
with EPS shows that maximum EPS yield was observed in the 
late exponential phase of 3.17 ± 0.12 g/L and biomass of 6.24 
g/L (Fig2) as reported by Sandrine et al, 200 0 [33].  
 
The EPS obtained by solvent extraction method from the 
isolate Bacillus sp.  2-11 was subjected to FT -IR analysis in the 
range 4000 –400 cm. FTIR spectrum indicates the major 
functional groups and chemical bonds present in EPS . The IR 
spectra of E PS produced by the Bacillus  2-11 spp revealed 
two major peaks and few minor peaks ( Fig 3 ). A major peak 
was observed at 3439.34 cm-1 which is distinctive of OH band 
and indicates the presence of car boxylic acids. T he adsorption 
peak at 1675.90cm-1 shows th e presence of carbonyl (C=O) 
stretching groups [34] that reveals the presence of 
polysaccharide.

62.73% and molecular weight 100 with retention time of 3.04 
(Fig-4). A second major peak of 4 -Methyl -3-(1-phenyl -3-
methylenebutyloxy) pentanol molecular weight 262 covering 
an area of 18.13 with retention time of 3.31 was o btained and 
other minor components were also observed.

Many bacteria can produce PHA and EPS polymers both 
intracellularly and extracellularly using carbon substrate as 
energy so urce under nitrogen limited condition. Thus it is 
essential to understand the relation between endo -and exo -S. Jenny angel and R. Dhandapani / Elixir Biosciences  96 (2016) 41371 -41375  
 41374  
polymers by the same microorganism. Sago liquid waste is the 
cheapest waste compared to other waste used in this study and 
utilization of agro -indus trial waste will also favours in 
reducing the overall production cost.
