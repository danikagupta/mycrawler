Abstract
Malachite green (MG), N-methylated diaminotriphenylmethane, is one of the most common dyes in textile industry and has
also been used as an effective antifungal agent. However, due to its negative impact on the environment and carcinogeniceffects to mammalian cells, there is a significant interest in developing microbial agents to degrade this type of recalcitrantmolecules. Here, an Exiguobacterium sp. MG2 was isolated from a river in Yunnan Province of China as one of the best
malachite green degraders. This strain had a high decolorization capability even at the concentration of 2500 mg/l and
maintained its stable activity within the pH range from 5.0 to 9.0. High-pressure liquid chromatography, liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry were employed to detect the catabolicpathway of MG. Six intermediate products were identified and a potential biodegradation pathway was proposed. This
pathway involves a series of reactions of N-demethylation, reduction, benzene ring-removal, and oxidation, which
eventually converted N-methylated diaminotriphenylmethane into N, N-dimethylaniline that is the key precursor to MG.Furthermore, our molecular biology experiments suggested that both triphenylmethane reductase gene tmr and
cytochrome P450 participated in MG degradation, consistent with their roles in the proposed pathway. Collectively, our
investigation is the first report on a biodegradation pathway of triphenylmethane dye MG in bacteria.

Introduction
Biodegradation refers to chemical decomposition of organic
substances by living organisms or other biological means. One
major purpose of microbial research in this field is to identify
environmental microorganisms with significant activities to de-grade recalcitrant organic substances and further investigate their
related pathways. Depending on the knowledge of biodegradative
pathways as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, geneticmethods can also be used to construct efficient microbial strains
with versatile and high degradation abilities. Similarly, multi-
functional biocatalyst may be created using the immobilized
enzyme technology, which could be an alternative strategy to
manage comprehensive ecological problems. For example, theaerobic biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) by microorganisms is a key process for eliminating these
toxic compounds from polluted soils and sediments [1]. Mean-while, the discovery of bacterial degradation to nitroaromatic
compounds, which are among the largest and most important
groups of industrial chemicals in use today though many of themare acutely toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic, is also demon-
strated a potential treatment for environmental contamination [2].
Malachite green (MG) is one type of triphenylmethane dyes and
is extensively used in both the textile industry and the fish farming
industry due to its relatively low cost, ready availability, and highefficacy against fish microbial pathogens. Despite its high value,MG is highly toxic to mammalian cells, and has been banned by
the US Food and Drug Administration [3]. Meantime, the
insufficient treatment of wastes from industries can also lead to
environmental problems [4]. Thus several different methods have
been explored to decontaminate wastewater and protect the
environment [5]. Developing microbial biodegradation agents is
an important approach for solving these problems due to their
effective cost, friendliness to the environment, and small quantities
of sludge [6,7].
The recalcitrant MG and its cytotoxicity present difficulties for
biodegradation. However, several microbial strains have been
reported capable of decolorizing MG. These microorganismsinclude the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium , three birds’
nest fungi such as Cyathus bulleri ,Cyathus stercoreus , and Cyathus
striatus , as well as some bacterial strains such as Achromobacter
xylosoxidans MG1, Bacillus cereus DC11, Aeromonas hydrophila DN322,
Pseudomonas otitidis W/L3, Mycobacteria ,Citrobacter strain KCTC
18061P, Mycobacteria and a strain from Kurthia sp. [7–13]. As for
the metabolic pathway(s) and genes involved MG degradation, an
incomplete biodegradation pathway of MG with triphenylmeth-
ane as the end-product has been partially described in the fungus
Cunninghamella elegans . In this pathway, the reactions included
reduction and N-demethylation, and produced tridesmethyl MG
or tridesmethyl leucomalachite green (LMG) (figure 1) [3]. In
bacterial decomposition of MG, the substrate is only known to
transform into colorless LMG by an enzyme triphenylmethane
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51808reductase (TMR) [14]. Additionally, other extracellular enzymes,
such as lignin peroxidase (LIP), laccase and manganese peroxidase
(Mnp) from white rot fungi, have been reported to be involved in
MG biodegradation, but the catalysis is a non-specific oxidizing
reaction to crystal violet or other triphenylmethane dyes [6]. The
role of cytochrome P450 in MG decolorization has also been
confirmed in strains of Mycobacterium chelonae ,M. avium and the
fungus C. elegans [3,9].
Despite progress so far in this area, our knowledge about
biodegradation of MG or other triphenylmethane dyes is still in its
infancy. Especially, no pathway for MG biodegradation has been
completely elucidated in any microorganisms. Here, we in-
vestigated MG decolorizing activity in the bacterium Exiguobacter-
iumsp MG2. The members of genus Exiguobacterium have never
been reported to decolorize MG. The experimental data from
high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatog-
raphy-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) led us to propose a potential catabolic
pathway for the degradation of triphenylmethane dyes in bacteria.
During biodegradation, a series of reactions, including N-
demethylation, reduction, benzene ring-removal, and oxidation,
drastically converted N-methylated diaminotriphenylmethane into
N, N-dimethylaniline that is a key precursor to MG. Furthermore,
evidences from molecular biology experiments also partially
supported the proposed pathway.
Materials and Methods
1. Ethics Statement
No specific permits were required for the described field studies.
No specific permissions were required for these locations/
activities. The location is not privately-owned or protected in
any way.
2. Isolation and Identification of Bacterial Strains for
Decolorizing Dye
The bacterial strains capable of decolorizing dye were screened
from river water samples in a city of Mile, Yunnan Province,
China. MG and crystal violet used in this study were of analytical
grade and purchased from Kermel Co. The screening of optimal
bacterial strains for dye decolorization was carried out on
enrichment agar plates containing (g/l): yeast extract 5, NaCl
10, tryptone 10, agar 20, and MG 50 mg/l. The bacterial
identification was mainly based on 16S rDNA sequences amplified
by PCR using two universal primers as follows: P(f) 5 9
AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG 3 9; P(r) 5 9
GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT 3 9[15]. The reaction conditions
were 35 cycles of 94 uC3 0s ,5 6 uC 30 s, and 72 uC 90 s. Lastly, the
16S rDNA gene produced from PCR was sequenced and analyzed
by comparing to those related sequences in GenBank.
3. Assay of MG Decolorization
Dye decolorization was monitored by the decrease of absor-
bance at 617 nm, the maximum wavelength of MG. The samples
were prepared as described by Wang et al [13]. Briefly, bacterial
cells were aerobically cultured in 250 ml asks containing 90 ml LB
medium at 38 uC with shaking at 190 rpm overnight. A moderate
concentration 40 mg/l of MG was added into 1 ml cultured cells.
After decolorization for 30 min or 2 h, bacterial cells were
removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 2 min, and then the
supernatant samples were used for absorbance measurement. Theactivity was determined by percentage decolorization. Decolor-
ization rate (%) = 100 (A – B)/A, in which A represented initial
absorbance and B represented observed absorbance after treat-ment [16]. All assays were performed in triplicates and the data
shown here were the averages of three repeats.
4. Factors Influence the Efficacies of MG Decolorization
The assays to determine the effect of different factors that
influenced the efficacies of decolorization were performed basedon previous studies [12,13]. After bacterial cells were aerobically
cultured under the same situations until cell density reached
OD
6000.50–0.60, the cultures with 109cells/ml were added to
various concentrations of MG and incubated for 3 h. After
incubation, decolorization rates were calculated using the samemethod as described above. The tested factors included different
concentrations of substrate and pH environments. In experiments
to detect the effect of MG concentration on the rate of
decolorization, sterile MG was added to a final concentration of
1000 mg/l, 1500 mg/l, 2000 mg/l and 2500 mg/l, respectively.To test the effect of pH on decolorization, the cultures were
respectively adjusted to pH 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 by using HCl or
NaOH.
5. Identification of the Intermediates in MG
Biodegradation by HPLC, LC-MS and GC-MS
For HPLC, the cells of Exiguobacterium sp. MG2 were first
induced into the resting stage. During the induction, bacterial cells
were aerobically cultured in 250 ml asks containing 100 ml LBmedium at 38 uC with shaking at 190 rpm overnight, followed by
centrifugation to remove the supernatant at 8,000 rpm and 4 uC
for 10 min. After washing in 50 mM PBS (pH 7.0) for three times,the preparation of testing cells was completed. Then, 6 ml resting
cells or the negative control of 6 ml 50 mM PBS were added into
the 100 ml MG solution with the concentration of 40 mg/l. When
the decolorization rates in the test group reached about 90%, the
cells was removed by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 20 min, andthe supernatant was concentrated to 1 ml by rotary evaporator at
50uC and then dissolved by 1 ml methanol. Another negative
control included the supernatant of resting cell without the
substrate MG to cross reference the peaks of extracellular
compounds. The operation conditions of the mobile phase wereammonium acetate (50 mM) from 70% to 5% in 50 min, and
acetonitrile from 30% to 95% within 50 min, the detector
wavelengths at 230 nm, 254 nm, 297 nm, 357 nm and 617 nm,the flow rate at 0.8 ml/min, and the LC column from ZORBAX
SB-C18 (4.6 6250 mm, 5 mm Agilent) at 35 uC temperature. The
injection volume was 10 ml.
The same samples were used in the LC-MS (G1969A LC/MSD
TOF). The mobile phase was water and acetonitrile. The initialacetonitrile proportion was 6% ramped gradually to 35% in
15 min, then to 60% in 20 min, finally reached 95% in 15 min,
and then held for 8 min. The ion source was ESI and the injection
volume was 15 ml, with 190 nm to 780 nm spectrum range.
Before the GC-MS assay (Agilent 7890A/5975C, USA), the
samples described above were further concentrated by evaporation
and then dissolved into 2 ml methanol. The temperature program
of the column was 100 uC to 280 uC at a rate of 6 uC/min. The
reaction intermediates were identified by comparing their spectra
with those of the standards. The split ratio was 10:1.
6. Inhibition of Dye Decolorization by Metyrapone
The involvement of cytochrome P450 in dye decolorization was
determined by examining the effect of metyrapone, a known
inhibitor of the enzyme. Cellular membrane and soluble fractions
were prepared as described before [13,17]. After the centrifugation
of fermentation broth, the pellet was washed in 50 mM PBSBiodegradation of Malachite Green in Bacterium

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51808(pH 7.0) containing 1.0 mM EDTA. Cells were disrupted by
sonication in an ice bath (on 5 s, off 7 s, time 15 min, 48%
amplitude) and MgCl 2was added to a final concentration of
2.0 mM. The crude extract fraction was obtained by centrifuga-
tion at 12,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 uC, and the supernatant fraction
was centrifuged again at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 uC to separate
the cytoplasmic membrane (pellet) and soluble (supernatant)
fractions. Lastly, the cellular membrane, soluble fractions, as well
as the mixture of them were added to a metyrapone solution
respectively to a final concentration of 10 mM. After incubation at
37uC for 10 min, the dye MG was added to a final concentration
of 10 mg/l. The changes in decolorization rates were determined
again. The negative control was the same volume of ddH 2O
instead of metyrapone.
7. Analysis of the tmrGene
To identify if tmr, the gene responsible for decolorizing
triphenylmethane dyes in Citrobacter sp. KCTC 18061P [14], also
existed in the Exiguobacterium sp. MG2, a pair of PCR primers were
designed based on the reference sequence GenBank AY756172.
The primers were P1 (f) 5 9GATAGGAGGCATTCACCTTG 3 9
and P1 (r) 5 9AGACTCTATGGATGCGCGC 3 9[14]. The
reaction conditions were 35 cycles of 94 uC3 0s ,5 6 uC 30 s, and
72uC 50 s. After PCR completed, the amplicon was sequenced and
further compared with those in the GenBank.
8. Statistical Analysis
All the data are expressed as mean values 6SD. Comparisons
among multiple groups were made with a one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnet t test. P#0.05 was used to
determine statistical significance of the observed differences
between treatments.
The Genbank accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene and
tmrgene in Exiguobacterium sp. MG2 are JX436461 and JX436462,
respectively.
Results
1. Identification of MG Decolorizing Bacterium and its
Decolorization Activities
Compared with other tested strains, an isolated bacterial strain
yielded the best growth and decolorization activity on the
enrichment medium containing 50 mg/l MG. When the sequenceof its 16S rRNA gene was compared with those in GenBank, it
showed a 99% similarity to the known sequences from
Exiguobacterium sp. But since 16S rRNA genes do not discriminate
among Exiguobacterium species, the isolate was designated Exiguo-
bacterium sp. MG2. Our strain has been submitted to the China
General Microbiological Culture Collection Center as CGMCC
4476.
Further quantitative analysis demonstrated that this strain could
maintain high MG decolorizing activities, for MGs in concentra-
tions ranging from 1000 mg/l to 2500 mg/l. When the dye
concentration reached 2500 mg/l, this bacterium still showed
93.5060.1% decolorizing efficiency within 2 h, the highest
decolorizing and tolerance abilities to MG reported so far. Itshould be noted that the efficiencies of dye decolorization reduced
tremendously with the increase of MG concentration at the initial
stage. As time went on, however, this decrease gradually becameunnoticeable (figure 2A). Furthermore, Exiguobacterium sp. MG2
could decolorize crystal violet, though the decolorization efficiency
was much lower than that of malachite green decolorization (data
not shown).Our data also showed little effects on decolorization efficiencies
within the assayed pH values. From pH 5.0 to 9.0, the strain’s MG
decolorizing activity was about 90% of the maximum efficiency(figure 2B).
2. Detection to Intermediate Products and the Probable
Pathway of MG Degradation
During incubation, the loss of MG color suggested that the dye
was transformed to its leuco- form [3]. To confirm this hypothesis,
the metabolites from resting cells of Exiguobacterium sp. MG2
incubated with MG were analyzed. HPLC, LC-MS and GC-MSwere employed to detect the intermediate products. From the
results of HPLC, we obtained several specific peaks of candidate
intermediate products that were clearly distinguished comparedwith the controls of MG without bacterial cells or only resting cellswithout MG. These peaks were found at retention times 2.352,
2.626, 7.036, 19.920, 21.087 and 23.560 (figure 3). Due to the
limitations of HPLC, we still lacked enough deterministic data toconfirm the categories of those substances. Therefore, LC-MS was
used and four possible intermediate products were identified
according to the m/z based on a previous report [18]. These peakscorresponded to MG (m/z 329) and its mono-derivatives (m/z315), LMG (m/z 331) and its mono-derivatives (m/z 317). The ion
polarities of these compounds were all positive. While another
substance with the m/z 120 of negative ion polarity, we consider itas N, N-dimethylaniline using the software Analyst QS and
ChemDraw (figure 4). Considering the potential biases for
detecting compounds among assays, the intermediates werefurther identified by GC-MS. From the GC-MS data, three
metabolites were detected, which were LMG, (4-Dimethylamino-
phenyl)-phenyl-methanone and 3-Dimethylamino-phenol respec-tively (figure 5).
Combining the results from HPLC, LC-MS and GC-MS, six
products including LMG, desmethyl MG or LMG, (4-Dimethy-lamino-phenyl)-phenyl-methanone, 3-Dimethylamino-phenol andN, N-dimethylaniline were identified (table S1). The results suggest
that biodegradation of MG involves a series of reactions of N-
demethylation, reduction, benzene ring-removal, and oxidation.
3. Cloning of the Gene tmr
In a previous study of bacterial biodegradation of MG, the
enzyme TMR was shown to be responsible for the conversion of
MG to LMG [14]. Here, a PCR reaction was used to isolate the
gene tmrfrom Exiguobacterium sp. MG2. After amplification with
genomic DNA as template, a specific amplicon of 691 bp wasobtained, as we had expected. Furthermore, the amplified gene of
tmrshowed 98% identity to that in Citrobacter sp. KCTC 18061P.
This result suggests that triphenylmethane reductase TMR inExiguobacterium sp. likely perform a similar function, contributing to
the reduction reaction during decolorization of MG.
4. Inhibition of Metyrapone on Decolorization
Cytochrome P450 is a large and diverse group of enzymes, most
of which functions to catalyze the oxidation of organic substances,drugs and other toxic chemicals. Because cytochrome P450 has
been reported to be involved in MG degradation of Mycobacteria
[9,19], metyrapone, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450, was used todetermine its impact on MG decolorization in our strain. Ourresults demonstrated that the decolorization efficiency from the
membrane fraction was about 42.9 61.5% after adding metyr-
apone compared to 69.8 62.1% in the negative control that was
added the same volume of ddH
2O instead of metyrapone; while
the decolorization efficiency from cytoplasm was about 3.7 60.7%Biodegradation of Malachite Green in Bacterium
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51808while the negative control had the decolorization efficiency of
19.861.2%. This result suggested that the metyrapone had an
obvious inhibitory effect on the decolorization in strain Exiguo-
bacterium sp. MG2, and that the mono-oxygenase cytochrome P450
likely participated in the biodegradation of MG.
Discussion
Many investigations on bacteria, including the strains such as
Pseudomonas otitidis W/L3, Achromobacter xylosoxidans MG1, Citrobacter
sp. KCTC 18061P, have been performed in the field of MG
biodegradation. At present, their biodegradation pathways as well
as the involved mechanisms still remained unclear [12–14].
Among all of the previously described bacterial strains, A.
xylosoxidans MG1 had a very high efficiency in MG decolorization.
It had been shown to reduce 88.50% of 2,000 mg/l MG within
2 h under an optimal condition [13]. However in our currentstudy, Exiguobacterium sp. MG2, the first strain in this genus that has
been reported to degrade MG, can remove 93.50% of the color
within the same time at the concentration of 2,500 mg/l dye.Furthermore, this bacterial strain has a very stable decoloring
activity within the broad pH range; while in A. xylosoxidans MG1,
different pHs showed significantly different results. For these
reason, Exiguobacterium sp. MG2 is the best MG degrader reported
so far.
To the knowledge on biodegradation pathway of triphenyl-
methane dyes, crystal violet degradation by B. subtilis IF0 13719
and Nocardia corallina seemed similar to each other that included
the breakage of triphenylmethane structure, and the presence ofMichler’s Ketone and a-dimethylaminophenol as the major end-
products [16,20]. However, either tridesmethyl MG or LMG, theend-products in MG degradation by C. elegan , keeps the intact
triphenylmethane structure [3,21]. Therefore, we here tried tomap a more comprehensive biodegradation pathway in strainExiguobacterium sp. MG2. Based on the metabolites determined in
our above experiments, we speculate that MG degradation in thisstrain at least involves the reactions of N-demethylation, reduction,benzene ring-removal, and oxidation. Lastly, we propose a MGdegradation pathway for Exiguobacterium sp. MG2 (figure 6). In this

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e51808pathway, the desmethyl-MG is derived form N-demethylation of
MG, which also occurs in the transformation of desmethyl-LMGfrom LMG in a later step. The reductive reaction is involved in theformation of LMG, an leuco form of MG. Benzene ring-removalcan be found in desmethyl-LMG’s cleavage to produce (4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-phenyl-methanone and benzene, whichalso involves the reaction of oxidation and the breaking of the C–Cbond. Again, the breaking of the C–C bond results in theemergence of 3-dimethylamino-phenol and benzaldehyde. Finally,N, N-dimethylaniline formation requires the reaction of hydroxy-removal. Analysis to the contribution of each reaction in MGtransformation suggests that the reductive reaction is a key step tochange the dye into its colourless form. Additionally, the reactionof benzene ring-removal together with oxidation achieves thebreakage of the triphenylmethane structure. And since the end-product N, N-dimethylaniline from the last step of hydroxy-removal is the industrial raw material of MG, it is theoretically
reasonable to reuse it in MG production.
Both PCR amplification to the tmrgene and the inhibition of
metyrapone on decolorization suggested that the enzyme TMR
and cytochrome P450 are involved in MG dye decolorization in
Exiguobacterium sp. MG2. In the postulated pathway, the first step
transforming MG to LMG is through the enzyme of TMR, whosefunction is well reported to catalyze MG into its leuco form [14].
Cytochrome P450 most likely participated in the production of
desmethyl-MG and desmethyl-LMG, as has been shown in thefungus C. elegans [3]. In addition, similar mechanisms might exist in
the formation of 3-dimethylamino-phenol and benzaldehyde in
MG biodegradation by Exiguobacterium sp. MG2 as those involved
in the production of Michler’s Ketone and a-dimethylaminophe-
nol during crystal violet degradation by B. subtilis IF0 13719 or N.
corallina . However, the genes or enzymes responsible for oxidation,

about the corresponding genes or enzymes is known.
In conclusion, this report is the first to propose a pathway about
MG biodegradation in bacteria. In addition, we have partiallyelucidated the probable molecular mechanisms. This study shouldhelp future understanding of the complete biodegradationmechanisms of MG or other triphenylmethane dyes with similarstructures. Furthermore, the widely distributed bacterium Ex-
iguobacterium sp. MG2 is nonpathogenic and has the highest
efficiency known in the decoloration of MG. If more genes orenzymes involved in MG biodegradation were elucidated, thisstrain as well as its pathway could be a candidate host from whichto construct a very useful ‘super bacterium’ for degradingrecalcitrant chemicals.Supporting Information
