ABSTRACT
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is currently an epidemic in the United States (US) and ibogaine is
reported to have the ability to interrupt opioid addiction by simultaneously mitigating withdrawal
and craving symptoms. This study examined opioid withdrawal and drug craving scores in 50
participants with OUD undergoing a week-long detoxification treatment protocol with ibogaine.
The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) was used for baseline characterization of participants ’OUD.
Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS), Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), and Brief
Substance Craving Scale (BSCS) scores were collected at 48 and 24 hours prior to ibogaine
administration, as well as 24 and 48 hours after ibogaine administration. At 48 hours following
ibogaine administration, withdrawal and craving scores were significantly lowered in comparison
to baseline: 78% of patients did not exhibit objective clinical signs of opioid withdrawal, 79%
reported minimal cravings for opioids, and 68% reported subjective withdrawal symptoms in the
mild range. Ibogaine appears to facilitate opioid detoxification by reducing opioid withdrawal and
craving in participants with OUD. These results warrant further research using rigorous controlled
trials.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Opioid use disorder (OUD) involving prescription and
non-prescription opioids is currently epidemic in the
United States (US) (Han et al. 2015 ). An average of 91
Americans die each day from opioid overdose and an
estimated 2.5 million are addicted to opioids (CDC
2016 ; Quality 2015). Prescription opioids have been
postulated to be a gateway to heroin use, as 79.5% of
new heroin users had prior exposure to prescription
opioids (Muhuri et al. 2013 ). Due to physical depen-
dence produced by chronic opioid administration,
opioid agonists and partial agonists such as methadone
and buprenorphine are recommended as management
options for opioid withdrawal (Dunlap and Cifu 2016 ).
While buprenorphine can increase retention rates in
treatment programs compared to placebo, only high-
dose buprenorphine (>16 mg/day) has been shown to
decrease illicit opioid use, and buprenorphine has abuse
and addiction potential itself (Jones et al. 2015 ; Mattick
et al. 2014 ). Methadone has been shown to be more
effective than buprenorphine in retaining patients in
treatment programs (Mattick et al. 2014 ). However, it
is no more effective in suppressing illicit opioid use and
is limited by nonlinear pharmacokinetics, druginteractions, QTc prolongation, and risk of death
(Mattick et al. 2014 ). Additionally, these treatment
options leave patients dependent on opioids, which
may not be in alignment with their treatment goals;
they carry ongoing risks associated with opioid therapy,
and may be limited in availability due to prescribing or
dispensing requirements or restrictions. Opioid with-
drawal may be managed with non-opioid supportive
therapies or by tapering opioids, although success
rates are low, with 91% of patients relapsing with this
strategy due to continued craving despite successful
detoxification (Smyth et al. 2010 ). Given epidemic mor-
bidity and mortality as well as limitations of current
treatments, it is clear that additional strategies for the
management of withdrawal in OUD are needed.
Ibogaine, a psychoactive and psychedelic alkaloid
found in the root bark of Tabernanthe iboga or bark
ofVoacanga africana , has a complex pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic profile that is not completely
understood (Jenks 2002 ). Ibogaine exhibits significant
affinity for targets in many neurotransmitter systems.
Affinities and K ivalues less than 10 μM were found at κ
opioid receptors, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) gluta-
matergic receptors, dopamine and serotonin reuptake
pumps, σ-1 and σ-2 receptors, as well as nicotinic

© 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLCreceptors (Litjens and Brunt 2016 ). Ibogaine is con-
verted to noribogaine by the cytochrome P450 isoen-
zyme CYP2D6. There is significant heterogeneity
within humans regarding metabolic capacity of
CYP2D6. There are also drugs that inhibit the enzyme ’s
metabolic capacity, creating potentially significant
drug-drug interactions. One study found a 26-fold
increase in peak plasma concentrations of ibogaine
and a 66-fold increase in the area under the curve
(AUC) or total drug exposure in patients that took
ibogaine after being pretreated with a CYP2D6 inhibi-
tor (paroxetine 20 mg) compared with a placebo (Glue
et al. 2015b ). This study exemplifies the role of
CYP2D6 in the pharmacokinetics of ibogaine and its
likely impact on efficacy and safety parameters of ibo-
gaine use (Glue et al. 2015b ; Litjens and Brunt 2016 ). In
persons exhibiting the most common CYP2D6 pheno-
type (extensive metabolizers), the half-life of ibogaine
was found to be 7.45 hours (Mash et al. 2001 ).
Noribogaine (12-OH-ibogaine) is an active metabo-
lite with many overlapping receptor affinities with its
parent compound, although it has notably higher affi-
nity for κand μopioid receptors (Litjens and Brunt
2016 ). While noribogaine binds to the μopioid receptor
with high affinity and was originally reported to have
full agonist activity, it lacked agonist effects such as
pupillary constriction or respiratory depression in
doses up to 60 mg in healthy volunteers and is cur-
rently thought to be a partial agonist or antagonist
(Antonio et al. 2013 ; Glue et al. 2015a ; Pablo and
Mash 1998 ). Noribogaine is lipophilic and has a large
volume of distribution in the body. Additionally, it has
a much longer elimination half-life than ibogaine and
was found to be 28 –49 hours in a dose escalation study
in healthy volunteers (Glue et al. 2015a ). Due to per-
sisting effects from slow elimination and modulation of
the opioid system, it has been hypothesized that nor-
ibogaine may be playing a pivotal role in blocking
opiate withdrawal symptoms or cravings and may pro-
vide a “self-tapering ”effect to those undergoing opioid
detoxification.Ibogaine was first hypoth esized to have utility in
the management of OUD in 1962 and was patented
as an interrupter of narcotic addiction in 1985
(Alper 2001 ;B r o w n 2013 ;W i n k e l m a n 2014 ). Since
that time, a handful of cas e series and small studies
have been conducted supporting the ability of ibo-
gaine to interrupt opioid addiction by simulta-
neously mitigating withdrawal symptoms and
cravings for opioids. A few case series reported
absence of opioid withdrawal symptoms within
12–48 hours following ibogaine administration,
although these studies did not employ the use of a
rating scale (Alper et al. 1999 ,2000 ; Luciano 1998 ;
Sheppard 1994 ). The three studies that employed the
use of a measurement scale in the extant literature
evaluating opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients
undergoing detoxification utilizing ibogaine are
summarized in Table 1 (Brown and Alper 2017 ;
Mash et al. 2001 ; Noller, Frampton, and Yazar-
Klosinski 2017 ). To our knowledge, only Mash
et al. have reported withdrawal outcomes using a
validated observer or clinician rated scale, whereas
other studies have used only subjective ratings.
Despite its novel pharmacologic profile, as well as
promising preclinical and pilot data in humans,
research regarding ibogaine ’s therapeutic potential
is scarce. This may be due to ibogaine being classi-
fied as an illicit substance in the US and many other
parts of the world, effectively hampering the ability
to investigate the therapeutic potential of ibogaine
for OUD. In Mexico, ibogaine remains an unregu-
lated drug and continues to be used for manage-
ment of addiction, including OUDs. US residents
may travel across the border to access treatment
with ibogaine and clinical programs exist to facil-
i t a t et h i st y p eo f “medical tourism. ”In the current
study, we aimed to evaluate opioid withdrawal and
drug craving scores using validated clinical instru-
ments in participants with OUD undergoing a week-
long detoxification treatment protocol with ibogaine
HCl (ibogaine).Table 1. Studies evaluating opiate withdrawal in patients undergoing ibogaine detoxification.

Program description
The program enrolls patients between the ages of 21 to
60years old who are experiencing problematic substance
use. The clinical continuum of care includes a three-part
treatment program that includes coaching and medical
screening prior to ibogaine administration, a week-long
ibogaine detoxification treatment, and optional residen-
tial aftercare program or weekly recovery coaching. The
first and third phases of treatment are typically carried
out in the US, while the week-long detoxification proto-
col occurs in Mexico due to aforementioned legal restric-
tions of ibogaine administration in the US. The week-
long ibogaine detoxification program takes place in an
inpatient medical center during the first four days, and
in a residential setting the final three days.
Individuals are excluded from treatment if they have
severe psychiatric conditions, including current or past
psychotic spectrum disorders, bipolar I disorder, cur-
rent eating disorders, or symptoms of impaired reality
testing or disorganized thinking. Medical exclusions for
treatment include prolonged QTc interval, history of
heart disease, pulmonary embolism, deep vein throm-
bosis, severe respiratory conditions such as emphysema
or COPD, obesity, gastrointestinal disorders such as
Crohn ’s disease or IBS, chronic infectious diseases,
cerebellar dysfunction, delirium, organic brain disease
or history of severe traumatic brain injury, epilepsy,
current pregnancy, abnormal electrolytes, or impaired
hepatic or renal function. Patients are also excluded
from treatment if they have used alcohol, ampheta-
mines, cocaine, or psychiatric medications in the week
prior to treatment, or have used long-acting opioids
such as buprenorphine or methadone in the four weeks
prior to treatment. Patients on benzodiazepines are not
discontinued. The program incorporates the Global
Ibogaine Therapy Alliance (GITA) consensus clinical
treatment guidelines as part of screening criteria and
risk management, which include a host of medical and
medication considerations for ibogaine treatment
(Dickinson et al. 2015 ). It should be noted that the
GITA clinical guidelines are an informational docu-
ment and that GITA does not accredit or regulate
ibogaine treatment centers, nor is it the aim of the
document to establish a universal standard of care for
ibogaine.
Prior to treatment at the ibogaine clinic in Mexico,
applicants are converted to short-acting opioids, and
maintenance therapies such as methadone and bupre-
norphine are required to be discontinued four weeks
prior to ibogaine treatment. Upon arrival at the clinic,patients undergo a physical examination onsite with a
staff physician. This exam includes a history and phy-
sical, 12-lead electrocardiogram, drug testing, complete
physical, and a complete blood count with differential
and metabolic panel. Patients are maintained on
immediate-release (IR) morphine following their initial
medical evaluation to prevent florid withdrawal up
until approximately four hours before ibogaine admin-
istration. The approximate half-life of IR morphine in
adults is 2 –4 hours, meaning that patients should not
be experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms at the
time ibogaine is administered, yet would be experien-
cing peak withdrawal symptoms 24 –48 hours later,
when post-ibogaine measurements were taken if ibo-
gaine were ineffective at reducing withdrawal.
The ibogaine treatment consists of oral administra-
tion of a total dose of 18 –20 mg/kg of ibogaine hydro-
chloride. A test dose of 100 mg is administered initially,
followed by the remainder of the calculated dose within
two hours of the test dose. The ibogaine is Voacanga-
derived and imported from Phytostan Enterprises, Inc.,
and is certified under Good Manufacturing Practice
(GMP) guidelines. The treatment occurs in a medically
supervised inpatient setting, which features vital sign,
telemetry, intravenous saline and electrolytes, and
monitoring of withdrawal symptom and mental status
both during and after ibogaine. The treatment center
has board-certified physicians who specialize in emer-
gency medicine, and nurses and paramedics on site at
all times while patients are in residence. If patients
experience post-acute withdrawal symptoms at
72 hours post-ibogaine administration, they are given
smaller doses of ibogaine (1 –5 mg/kg) for the remain-
ing treatment duration, with or without clonidine or
gabapentin as needed.
Participants and study design
A retrospective chart review of participants admitted to
asingle residential ibogaine treatment center in Mexico
during 2015 was conducted. The Addiction Severity
Index (ASI), fifth edition (McLellan et al. 1992 ) was
used at baseline to gauge the severity of participants ’
problems with opioid consumption. Participants were
included if they participated in ibogaine treatment pri-
marily for management of OUD and carried a diagno-
sis of OUD made by clinic physicians using DSM-5
criteria (APA 2013 ). Participants were excluded if they
participated in ibogaine treatment for an indication
other than problematic opioid consumption or were
polysubstance users who indicated an alternative sub-
stance to be their primary problem class of drug.JOURNAL OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS 3Participants lacking complete Clinical Opioid
Withdrawal Scale (COWS) scores were excluded.
COWS (Wesson and Ling 2003 ), SOWS
(Handelsman et al. 1987 ), and Brief Substance
Craving Scale (BSCS) (Somoza et al. 1995 ) scores
were collected by a clinic physician at 48 and
24 hours prior to ibogaine administration, as well as
24 and 48 hours after ibogaine administration.
Measurement times were approximately the same
from day to day and mirrored the physician ’s natura-
listic daily rounding practice as part of the clinical care
provided. The COWS is a validated 11-item, clinician-
administered scale with scores ranging from 0 –48 and
is scored as no withdrawal (<5), mild withdrawal (5 –
12), moderate withdrawal (13 –24), moderately severe
(25–36), and severe (>36) (Tompkins et al. 2009). The
SOWS is a 16-item, self-administered scale with scores
ranging from 0 –64 and is scored as mild withdrawal
(0–10), moderate withdrawal (11 –20), and severe with-
drawal (>20) (Handelsman et al. 1987 ). The BSCS is a
three-item instrument that assesses intensity, fre-
quency, and length of drug cravings (Somoza et al.
1995 ). In some participants, ASI, SOWS, or BSCS
scores were missing, although COWS data were avail-
able for all participants. Results are labeled with the
number of participants for which data were available.
This study was determined to be exempt by Western
University of Health Sciences Institutional Review
Board due to using de-identified data as part of a retro-
spective chart review study.
Study outcomes and statistical analysis
Demographic and clinical variables collected at baseline
included age, gender, and ASI. The ASI consists of a
semi-structured interview that gathers information that
is categorized into seven domains common to sub-
stance use disorders that impact patient lives.
Domains include medical status, employment and sup-
port, drug use, alcohol use, legal status, family/social
status, and psychiatric status, which are each given a
composite score that is then interpreted as a low-,
medium-, or high-level problem domain based upon
predetermined instrument cutoffs. Baseline composite
ASI data were analyzed descriptively.
The primary outcome variable was change in COWS
scores pre- and post-ibogaine administration and was
analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Secondary outcome variables included
changes in SOWS and BSCS scores that were also
analyzed using ANOVA. Alpha values were set to 0.05
for statistical significance and pairwise comparisons
were used to ensure that any statistical differencesdiscovered were between pre- and post-phases of ibo-
gaine detoxification. Additional secondary outcomes
included differences between COWS, SOWS, and
BSCS scores 48 hours before ibogaine administration
(baseline) and 48 hours after ibogaine administration.
Percentages of participants experiencing different seve-
rities of withdrawal symptoms and cravings were ana-
lyzed categorically by predetermined symptom scale
cutoff scores.
Results
Fifty participants were included in the studies ’analysis
of COWS data while 40 participants were included in
the demographic analysis, as 10 participants were miss-
ing a baseline ASI ( Tables 2 and3).
The mean age in the sample was 31.28 ± 8.38 years
(range 19 –51 years) and 39% were female. Regarding
the drug perceived to be the primary problem, most
participants (60%, n= 24) reported heroin, while 15
(37.5%) reported prescription opioids, with one report-
ing an alternative (unknown) opioid. Of those who
reported heroin use as their primary problem, 66.7%
(n= 16) stated that the intravenous route was usually
used, whereas among patients who reported prescrip-
tion opioids as their primary problem, only one parti-
cipant reported usually using the intravenous route.
Most participants (82.5%) were polysubstance users
and a wide range of secondary drug problems were
reported, including alcohol, prescription opioids, seda-
tive hypnotics and anxiolytics, cocaine, amphetamines,
cannabis, and gamma-hydroxy butyrate (GHB). There
were seven participants (17.5%) who did not report a
secondary drug problem. Seventy-five percent ( n= 30)
reported receiving treatment for their drug problem in
the past, while 85% ( n= 34) endorsed prior use of
methadone or buprenorphine. Fifteen percent reported
at least one overdose requiring medical attention in the
past, and participants reported spending an average of
$1666.85 on drugs in the 30 days prior to the baseline
ASI (S.D. $1833.99, median $1000, range $0 –10,000).
Additional demographic and drug use descriptive
information can be found in Table 2 .
ASI composite scores ( Table 3 ) revealed an average
composite score in the drug domain of 0.206 ± 0.06,
indicating on average medium-level problematic opioid
use, although 47.5% scored high enough to indicate a
severe drug problem. Other composite domains in
which a significant portion of the sample scored high
enough to indicate a severe problem included family
and social relationships, medical, and psychiatric
domains. Alcohol was the least problematic domain
for the sample overall.4 B. J. MALCOLM ET AL.COWS scores averaged 8.2 ± 5.21 and 7.64 ± 5.27 at
48 and 24 hours prior to ibogaine administration,
respectively, indicating that participants were observed
to be experiencing mild opioid withdrawal symptoms
while being maintained on immediate-release (IR)
morphine (mild range score = 5 –12). Mean group
scores decreased to 5.26 ± 4.31 at 24 hours and to
3.30 ± 3.13 (non-clinical range) at 48 hours afteribogaine administration, indicating a reduction in with-
drawal symptoms despite total cessation of opioids
(Figure 1(a )). The repeated measures ANOVA for
COWS scores showed significant decreases over time
with pairwise comparisons indicating significant differ-
ences between pre- and post-ibogaine phases of the
detoxification protocol (Wilk ’s Lambda = 0.463, F (3,
47) = 18.71, p< 0.01, η2 = 0.537). At 48 hours afterTable 3. Addiction severity index: Baseline composite scores ( n=40).

Discussion
In the largest sample of observed opioid-dependent
patients undergoing an ibogaine detoxification protocol
to date, we found significant reductions in objective
and subjective opioid withdrawal scale scores as well
as significant reductions in patient-reported cravings
for opioids. To our knowledge, there have been few
published studies investigating ibogaine ’s effects on
opioid withdrawal in humans (Alper et al. 1999 ;
Brown and Alper 2017 ; Luciano 1998 ; Mash et al.
2001 ; Noller, Frampton, and Yazar-Klosinski 2017 ;
Sheppard 1994 ). Our results are consistent with results
reported previously and help to build an evidence base
for further study of ibogaine in the management of
withdrawal from opioids.
Ibogaine appears to be unique in that it can simul-
taneously attenuate withdrawal symptoms as well as
opioid cravings in a relatively brief treatment time-
frame. The ability of ibogaine to address psychological
aspects of OUD, such as drug craving, is a potentially
important advantage compared to existing therapeutic
approaches, since relapse after successful detoxification
presents a high risk of overdose-related death due to
participants overestimating their tolerance and using
doses similar to what they were previously accustomed
to. By addressing this aspect of OUD, ibogaine may
help position participants for greater success in their
path of recovery, which is corroborated by reports ofdecreased drug use in longitudinal studies (Brown and
Alper 2017 ; Davis et al. 2017 ; Noller, Frampton, and
Yazar-Klosinski 2017 ). Ibogaine is not a “magic bullet ”
for OUD, and successful recovery in most individuals
will likely require extensive support and aftercare.
Furthermore, given ibogaine ’s psychedelic nature, sup-
port should be present in preparation for and during
the experience in addition to afterwards, in order to
maximize benefit and minimize risks of psychedelic
therapy in accordance with successful treatment proto-
cols used in evolving psychedelic research (Thomas,
Malcolm, and Lastra 2017 ).
In recent years, psychedelics have gained momen-
tum as experimental therapies for the treatment of
various psychiatric disorders, including substance use
disorders (Bogenschutz et al. 2015 ; Garcia-Romeu,
Griffiths, and Johnson 2014 ; Krebs and Johansen
2012 ; Thomas et al. 2013 ; Thomas, Malcolm, and
Lastra 2017 ). Compared to other “classical ”psychedelic
compounds like psilocybin or lysergic acid diethyla-
mide (LSD), ibogaine is unique both from a subjective
experience and safety perspective. Subjectively, ibogaine
is described as oneiric, with more pronounced dream-
like imagery, especially when the participant ’s eyes are
closed. Participants may relive their past in a movie-like
fashion, often accompanied by auditory phenomena as
well as unpleasant emotional content or physical sensa-
tions (Schenberg et al. 2017 ). In contrast, compounds
like psilocybin or LSD have a higher propensity for
euphoria and feature more pronounced visual phenom-
ena. Ibogaine also demonstrates a unique ability to
mitigate opioid withdrawal compared with classical
psychedelics; however, it appears to carry a higher
risk of severe adverse outcomes, including fatalities,
many with a suspected or confirmed cardiac etiology
reported in the literature (Asua 2013 ; Hildyard et al.
2016 ; Litjens and Brunt 2016 ;O’Connell et al. 2015 ).
Unfortunately, safety information, such as vital signs
and telemetry reports, were not available for review in
this study. Other adverse psychological reactions,
including mania, have been described, and although
rare, are also possible with classical psychedelics
(Marta et al. 2015 ). Ibogaine detoxification should not
be attempted in a medically unsupervised environment
and access to emergency medical services should be
available. At least one death has occurred within a
study, although administration of ibogaine below the
standard of care was suspected in this case (Noller,
Frampton, and Yazar-Klosinski 2017 ). While ibogaine
carries risks that are potentially severe and should not
be casually overlooked, there are more people dying in
the US every day from opioid overdoses than have ever
been reported in the literature to have occurred withJOURNAL OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS 7ibogaine, which may help balance the risk-benefit cal-
culus in favor of further research with ibogaine (CDC
2016 ; Litjens and Brunt 2016 ).
In considering reports of adverse effects during ibo-
gaine treatment, the populations presenting for ibo-
gaine detoxification treatment often exhibit greater
severity and chronicity of addiction, intravenous drug
use, medical co-morbidities and fragility after failing
mainstream treatments, thus placing them at greater
risk for medical complications during detoxification
treatment. The epidemic degree of morbidity and mor-
tality inflicted by licit and illicit opioid medications on
US citizens may make it tempting to consider opioid
detoxification with ibogaine if participants are refrac-
tory to first-line treatment options or are not interested
in continued opioid dependence with buprenorphine or
methadone. On the other hand, the clandestine nature
of ibogaine clinics and lack of high-quality data from
rigorous clinical trials supporting safety and efficacy
may deter those considering use.
Our study used an open-label and retrospective
design that lacked a control group, which introduces
the possibility of a placebo effect and various forms
of bias. The probability of a placebo effect accounting
for observed results is thought to be low by the study
authors, as effect sizes for all outcome measures were
large and participants would be expected to be
undergoing peak withdrawal symptoms 24 –72 hours
after opioid cessation, which is precisely when the
post-ibogaine measurements were taken and scores
were decreasing. Ibogaine has a complex mechanism
of action that is not fully understood, although it
includes long-acting and active metabolites; thus,
continued opioid withdra wal blocking effects by
drug metabolites despite normalization of mental
status post-ibogaine cannot be ruled out (Litjens
and Brunt 2016 ; Popik, Layer, and Skolnick 1995 ).
Participants did tend to report a more severe level of
withdrawal symptoms than clinicians both before and
after treatment with ibogai ne, which could indicate
the presence of an observer bias in clinicians or
possible drug-seeking behavior on behalf of
participants.
Ibogaine appears to be able to effectively detoxify
participants from opioids while simultaneously redu-
cing cravings. Future studies should aim to elucidate
predictive factors of treatment response, as well as
employ greater methodologic rigor. Genetic or meta-
bolic factors, such as the presence of variant CYP2D6
alleles, play a significant role in individual pharmaco-
kinetics of ibogaine and elucidation of metabolic capa-
city prior to treatment could have a positive impact on
efficacy and safety parameters. Due to the epidemicpublic health problem of opioid use disorders in the
US, emergency measures should be taken to reduce
barriers to legitimate medical research into ibogaine ’s
addiction-interrupting properties and rigorous con-
trolled trials testing safety and efficacy should be
undertaken.
