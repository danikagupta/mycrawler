Abstract T h ea i mo ft h ep r e s e n ts t u d yw a st h e
decolourisation of mixture of two dyes belonging to dif-
ferent groups by two Pseudomonas fluorescens strains
(Sz6 and SDz3). Influence of different incubation condi-
tions on decolourisation effectiveness was evaluated.
Dyes used in the experiment were diazo Evans blue(EB) and triphenylmethane brilliant green (BG). Another
goal of the experiment was the estimation of toxicity of
process by-produc ts. Incubation conditions had a signifi-
cant influence on the rate of decolourisation. The best
results were reached in shaken and semistatic samples
(exception Evans blue). After 24 h of experiment insemistatic conditions, BG rem oval reached up to 95.4 %,
EB 72.8 % and dyes mixture 88.9 %. After 120 h, all
tested dyes were completely removed. In most cases, dyes
were removed faster and better by strain Sz6 than SDz3.
At the end of the experiment, in majority of the samples,
decrease of phyto- and zootoxicity was observed.

Synthetic dyes especially azo and triphenylmethane
ones are used in many industrial branches for dyeing
of wool, cotton, nylon, leather, paper, cosmetics, phar-
maceuticals, food, plastic, petroleum products, etc.(Hamid and Rehman 2009 ; Koyani et al. 2013 ;
Padamavathy et al. 2003; Somasiri et al. 2006;S w a m y
and Ramsay 1999;T o n ye ta l . 2009; Younes et al. 2012).
There are 100,000 commercially available dyes. Annual
global dyes production reaches almost 7×10
7t. Among
the 12 classes of dyes, the majority (70 %) are azo dyescontaining one or more azo groups. Because of the
imperfection of dyeing pro cess, approximately 10 –
15 % of the synthetic dyes is released into the industrialwaste, causing serious environmental problems world-
wide (Hamid and Rehman 2009;K o y a n ie ta l . 2013;
Tony et al. 2009; Silveira et al. 2009). Inadequate treat-
ment of coloured wastewaters may lead to contamina-
tion of surface waters. The consequence is reduction of
the penetration of light, photosynthetic activity and de-ficiency of oxygen. Synthetic origin of dyes and com-
plex aromatic molecular structure cause that many
ofthem are toxic and mutagenic, resistant to biologicaldegradation and may be accumulated in the food chain
(Azmi et al. 1998; Banat et al. 1996; Forgacs et al. 2004;
Hamid and Rehman 2009; Koyani et al. 2013; Pointing
and Vrijmoed 2000 ; Sani and Banerjee 1999 ).
Increasing use of dyes causes an increase of their
concentration in the environment and requires the de-velopment of new, environmentally and economicallyWater Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:1846

provided by Crossrefacceptable treatment technology. Currently available
physicochemical methods (chemical oxidation, reverseosmosis, adsorption, flotation, precipitation, coagula-
tion) are very effective but are costly, energy intensive,
have limited use and can lead to the production of toxicby-products and a large amount of sludges (Eichlerova
et al. 2006; Hamid and Rehman 2009;H u2001;K o y a n i
et al. 2013;T o n ye ta l . 2009). In comparison with the
methods mentioned above, the methods based on mi-
crobial removal of dyes tend to be more attractive and
are becoming more and more popular. Microbial degra-dation of dyes is gaining importance as an ecological,
economical, less invasive alternative treatment tech-
niques (Forgacs et al. 2004; Hamid and Rehman 2009;
Koyani et al. 2013;S a r a t a l ee ta l . 2011; Silveira et al.
2009 ; Singh and Pakshirajan 2010 ; Srinivasan and
Viraraghavan 2010 ; Tony et al. 2009 ; Younes et al.
2012;Z a b łocka-Godlewska et al. 2012). Literature de-
scribes the participation of different taxonomic groupsof organisms (bacteria, fungi, algae, plants) in the dyes
decolourisation. The most popular are the technologies
based on biodegradation/biotransformation of dyes byliving bacteria or fungi. A lot of studies especially in case
of fungi are concentrated on physical sorption on living
or dead biomass. These technologies are more attractivethan physical and chemical treatment methods due to low
operating costs, high effectiveness and environmental
harmlessness (An et al. 2002;C h e ne ta l . 2003;W a n g
et al. 2012;W ue ta l . 2009,2012). Bacteria used in these
technologies are applied as a single strain, co-cultures of
strains or mixed bacterial cultures. The most populargenera of bacteria described in literature are
Pseudomonas ,Bacillus ,Sphingomonas ,Aeromonas ,
Citrobacter ,Escherichia ,Desulphovibrio ,Proteus ,
Schewanella andAlcaligenes (An et al. 2002;N i g a m
et al. 1996; Saratale et al. 2011;S h a r m ae ta l . 2004;
Tony et al. 2009;W a n ge ta l . 2012).
It was proven that the efficiency of dye removal
depends on the type of microorganisms and the process
conditions. The most important factors are temperature,
oxygen level, pH, additional available carbon and nitro-
gen sources, as well as the concentration of the dye and
its chemical structure (Azmi et al. 1998; Banat et al.
1996; Forgacs et al. 2004; Hamid and Rehman 2009;
Koyani et al. 2013; Padamavathy et al. 2003; Pointing
and Vrijmoed 2000 ;P r z y s t a śet al. 2009 ;S a n ia n d
Banerjee 1999 ; Saratale et al. 2011 ; Stolz 2001 ;
Swamy and Ramsay 1999;T o n ye ta l . 2009; Younes
et al. 2012;Z a b łocka-Godlewska et al. 2009).Abilities of two strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens
isolated from two different wastewater treatment plantsfor decolourisation of various structurally dyes were stud-
i e dp r e v i o u s l y( Z a b łocka-Godlewska et al. 2012). Five
different dyes belonging to three different groups wereexaminated (two fluorone dyes , triphenylmethane brilliant
green and crystal violet and azo Evans blue). Results of
test of decolourisation potential showed significant differ-ences between abilities of both tested strains.
Triphenylmethane and azo dyes were more efficiently
removed by Sz6 strain isolated from small treatment plant.Removal of triphenylmethane dyes was more effective
than other examined groups. Strain Sz6 removed almost
all colour in samples with triphenylmethane dyes regard-less of dye concentration and structure and strain SDz3
only in samples with dyes concentration 0.05 gl
−1. Higher
content of dyes (0.1 gl−1) was removed by this strain in
62 % for crystal violet and 46 % for brilliant green.
Most researches are focused on the removal of indi-
vidual dyes from wastewater, whereas the coloured
wastewater contains a mixture of them. Relatively few
studies on mixtures of dyes were conducted. In general,these studies were focused on dyes belonging to the
same group (mainly azo group), (Saratale et al. 2010;
Singh and Pakshirajan 2010 ;T o n ye ta l . 2009 ;
Vijaykumar et al. 2007). In addition, information about
ecotoxicity of the biotransformation products is limited.
In our study, we focused our attention on the removalefficiency of dyes mixture by two Pseudomonas strains.
The mixture was prepared from dyes belonging to two
different groups (azo and triphenylmethane) that wasnot investigated in any others studies. These two groups
of dyes are more frequently used for dying processes
and may be found in effluents. Such mixture may bemore difficult for removal than single dyes as well as
mixture of dyes from one family. Another goal of our
study was to evaluate the ecotoxicological impact onaquatic organisms of biotransformation products.

2.1 Bacterial Strains Used in the ExperimentBacterial strains used in experiment Sz6 and SDz3 were
isolated from two different wastewater treatment plantsin south Poland. Both selected strains were classified by
the API 20NE test (Biomerieux) as Pseudomonas
fluorescens (Zab łocka-Godlewska et al. 2012).1846, Page 2 of 13 Water Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:1846Species from Pseudomonas genus are Gram-
negative, aerobic rod-shaped bacteria belongingto the family Pseudomonadaceae ,a l m o s ta l l
strains are motile (a single polar flagellum). As
Gram-negative bacteria, they have thin cell wallcontaining up to 10 % of peptidoglycan and outer
membrane composed of proteins, phospholipids
and lipopolysaccharides. Strains Pseudomonas
fluorescens are free-living bacteria, commonly
found in environment (soil, water, effluents, sur-
face of plants, animals, they are natural compo-nent of human and animal intestinal microflora),
some of them may be pathogens (Salyers and
Whitt 2000 ;S c h l e g e l 1993 ).
2.2 Influence of Dyes Concentration on Decolourisation
Effectiveness
Influence of five different concentrations (0.01, 0.025,
0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 gl
−1) of Evans blue (Zab łocka-
Godlewska et al. 2012) and brilliant green (Table 1)o n
decolourisation effectiveness was estimated. The dyes
mixture was prepared at the equal proportion (1:1) ofboth dyes. Influence of six different concentrations ofdyes mixture (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1 and 0.12 gl
−1)
on decolourisation effectiveness was estimated. Tubetest on liquid Kimura medium was done in triplicate.
Bacterial strains inoculums were prepared from 48 h
slants (Nutrient Agar (Fluka Biochemika)) washed withphysiological salt solution (suspension density estimat-
ed by the McFarland scale was 5). Filter-sterilised
colourants were added to tubes containing 10 ml of48-h old cultures in stationary growth phase (15×
10
8cfu ml−1). After 6 days of incubation in 26 °C,
absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically onUV–Vis Hitachi U-1900 (determined optimum wave-
length for Evans blue was
max−606 nm , for brilliant
green max−624 nm and dyes mixture max−591 nm ).
Percentage of dye removal was calculated according to

The main experiment was prepared in a similar way as
the previous test, the difference was that the inoculum
(1 ml) was added to 300 ml flasks containing 100 ml ofKimura medium. On the basis of the results of previous
tests, concentrations of dyes chosen for experiment with
single dyes were 0.05 gl
−1for Evans blue (Zab łocka-
Godlewska et al. 2012) and 0.1 gl−1for brilliant green.
Dyes concentration in sample with mixture was 0.08
gl−1(0.04 gl−1Evans blue and 0.04 gl−1brilliant green
(Sigma-Aldrich)). Water solution of dyes was filter-
sterilised (Millipore cellulose filters Ø 0.20 μm) and
added to 48-h old bacterial samples (stationary growthphase). Cultures were incubated in static, semistatic and
shaken conditions in 26 °C. Dead biomass (biomass
autoclaved for 20 min in 121 °C, 1.5 atm.) was usedfor estimation of biosorption. Absorbance was mea-
sured after 1, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h of incubation
(UV–Vis spectrophotometer Hitachi U1900). The
wavelengths for Evans blue (606 nm), brilliant green
(624 nm) and dyes mixture (591 nm) were determined
experimentally as the wave with maximal absorbance.Percentage of dye removal was calculated the same as
previously according to Formula ( 1).
2.4 Toxicity Evaluation
The zootoxicity was evaluated using Daphnia magna
(OECD 202) and phytotoxicity using OECD Lemna sp.
growth inhibition test no. 221. Tests were performed inquadruple. EC50 value was estimated. On the basis of
these data, acute toxicity unit (TUa) was calculated
(Formula 2) and toxicity class was established.
TUa¼100 =EC50
where
EC50 is the effective concentration of a wastewater
sample that causes 50 % inhibition of tested organisms.
Samples were classified according to ACE 89/BE
2/D3 Final Report Commission EC (TUa<0.4 —non
toxic (I class); 0.4 ≤TUa<1.0 —low toxicity (II class);
1.0≤TUa<10 —toxic (III class); 10 ≤TUa≤100—
high toxicity (IV class); TUa>100 —extremely toxic
(V class)).3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Influence of Dyes Concentration on Decolourisation
Effectiveness
Influence of dyes concentrations (BG and mixture) was
evaluated (Fig. 1a, b ). Results for Evans blue were
already presented (Zab łocka-Godlewska et al. 2012 ).
Increase of Evans blue concentration up to 0.075gl −
1
caused decrease of effectiveness of decolourisation by
strain SDz3. For further study, the dye concentration0.05gl −
1was chosen (Zab łocka-Godlewska et al.
2012). Brilliant green was better removed than Evans
blue (Fig. 1a). Concentration 0.1gl −1of brilliant green
was removed by strain SDz3 in 84 % and by strain Sz6
in 72.7 %. Strain SDz3 almost completely removed this
dye in concentrations 0.01 –0.05 gl−1. Second tested
strain (Sz6) removed BG in more than 95 % when
concentration was between 0.01 and 0.05 gl−1.F o r
further researches, this concentration of dye was chosen.
Examined dyes belong to different groups, and different
microbial decolourisation mechanism is involved in theprocess. The first step of microbial decolourisation of
azo dyes is generally anaerobic process, which involves
azoreductase enzymes activity and also oxygen insensi-tive azoredictase (Ola et al. 2010; Khalid et al. 2008;
Nachiyar and Rajakumar 2005 ). Bacterial
decolourisation of triphenylmethane dyes needs activityof triphenylmethane reductase (TMR) and in some cases
cytochrome P450 (Wang et al. 2012). In our previous
study (Zab łocka-Godlewska et al. 2012 ), strain Sz6
better removed brilliant green than Evans blue in con-
centration 0.1 gl
−1(96.5 and 84 %, respectively). In case
of strain SDz3, significant differences were noticed inconcentration 0.05 gl
−1(93.1 and 72.5 %, respectively).
Also, in our other study (Przysta śet al. 2012 ), we
observed that brilliant green was better removed thanEvans blue when present in concentration 0.05 gl
−1
in samples with different b acteria strains (regardless
of incubation conditions). Differences between re-sults reached for strains belonging to the same
genus were also proved by Przystas et al. ( 2012 ).
Two strains of Pleurotus ostreatus fungi had a
different potential for the removal of the same dyes
what may be connected with adaptation to the
specific conditions in site of isolation. High impact
of dye concentration on decolourisation effective-
ness was also presented by Wu et al. ( 2009 )a n d
Solis et al. ( 2012 ).1846, Page 4 of 13 Water Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:1846Increase of concentration of dyes mixture had a sig-
nificant influence on its removal by both strains (Fig. 1b).
Concentrations between 0.02 and 0.08 gl−1were removed
by both tested strains in more than 75 %. Increase of dyesmixture concentration up to 0.1 gl−1significantly de-
creased effectiveness of the process (removal below
50 %) As it is presented in Fig. 1b, the most appropriate
mixture concentration for further studies was 0.08gl−1.0 20 40 60 80 100 1200.01 g/l0.025g/l0.05g/l0.075g/l0.1g/l

The best results of removal of Evans blue were reached
in static samples (Fig. 2a). These results were presented
in our previous publication (Zab łocka-Godlewska et al.
2012). Strain Sz6 was more effective in dye removal
than SDz3 (after 48 h, about 96 and 87 % dye removal
respectively). Finally, the dye was completely removedby both strains. In comparison with the results reached
in samples with Evans blue, decolourisation of brilliant
green in static conditions was lower (after 48 h SDz3removed 66.15 % and Sz6 59.9 %). Initial concentration
of brilliant green was two times higher than Evans
blue. In spite of higher concentration removal ofbrilliant green by strain SDz3 at the end of exper-
iment reached 91.16 %.
Initially, in semistatic conditions, results of removal
of Evans blue (Fig. 2b) were not so good as in static
samples (after 48 h, SDz3 removed 75.1 % and Sz682.8 %). After 120 h of experiment, decolourisation by
Sz6 strain reached 100 % as well as dyes mixture and
brilliant green. In comparison with static samples insemistatic samples, acceleration of brilliant green and
dyes mixture removal by strain Sz6 was observed. After
24 h of experiment, the level of removal was higher than90 % and after 48 h, complete decolourisation was
observed. Effectiveness of brilliant green removal by
strain SDz3 was comparable in static and semistaticconditions (after 120 h, 91.2 and 84.5 %, respectively).
Presented results for brilliant green are similar with our
previous results (Przysta śet al. 2012 ). Regardless of
used strain, the best results of BG decolourisation were
reached in shaken conditions what can suggest that
oxygen is important in this process. In opposite to theresult presented above for Pseudomonas fluorescens
strains (Sz6 and SDz3), Evans blue was better removed
byChryseomonas luteola andBurkholderia cepacia
tested earlier (Przysta śet al. 2012)i ns h a k e ns a m p l e s .
All of these strains are aerobic, so these results suggest
involving of different biodegradation mechanisms.Higher effectiveness of triphenylmethane crystal violet
decolourisation in shaken than static conditions was also
reached for Citrobacter sp. by An et al. ( 2002).
In present studies, a positive influence of agitation on
triphenylmethane dye removal by both Pseudomonas
strains was noticed. In opposite to our results, Wanget al. ( 2011 ) stated that in case of Achromobacter
xylosoxidans , MG1 sample agitation had no influence
on triphenylmetane decolourisation. It suggestscontribution of different decolourisation pathways in
process. Current knowledge about triphenylmethanedyes decolourisation mechanisms is still in its infancy
(Wang et al. 2011,2012). In study of biodegradation of
triphenylmethane malachite green (MG) presented byJang et al. ( 2005 ), the triphenylomethane reductase
(TMR) was shown to be responsible for the conversion
of MG to colourless leucomalachite green (LMG).Wang et al. ( 2012) speculate that MG degradation by
Exiguobacterium sp. involves the reaction of N-demeth-
ylation, reduction, benzene ring removal and oxidation.In the postulated pathway, the first step transforming
MG to LMG is through the enzyme TMR. Cytochrome
P450 most likely participated in further transformationof MG. This superfamily of hemoproteins has been also
reported to be involved in triphenylomethane dyes deg-
radation by Mycobacteria (Jones and Falkinham 2003;
Wang et al. 2012). Wang et al. ( 2011) highlighted that
decolourisation mechanism of these type of dyes mightbe both the intracellular and extracellular. Differences in
rate and abilities for dyes decolourisation between
strains are probably connected with various mechanisms
of dye transformation as it was presented by Wang et al.
(2012) and Wu et al. ( 2012).
Samples agitation had a negative influence on the
effectiveness of Evans blue decolourisation (Fig. 2c).
Results are also presented and described in the previous
publication (Zab łocka-Godlewska et al. 2012 ). After
120 h, strain SDz3 removed 64.0 % and Sz6 67.2 %
of dye. Decolourisation of azo dyes may occur under
strictly anaerobic, facultative anaerobic or aerobic con-ditions. It depends on the strain and mechanism of
biotransformation. Agitation caused increase of oxygen
concentration in samples. Effect of agitation and chang-es of oxygen concentration on azoreductase activity is
widely described in literature (Saratale et al. 2011 ).
Worse decolourisation results in semistatic and shakensamples point out on possible oxygen inhibition effect
on azoreductases activity. Azoreductases are responsible
for the first step on decolourisation of azo dyes intosimpler aromatic compounds (Saratale et al. 2011).
Results of dyes mixture removal were similar in
shaken and semistatic samples (100 % dye removal after48 h) for strain Sz6 (Fig. 2b). For this strain, results are
similar to these reached for brilliant green. The rate of
dyes mixture removal by strain SDz3 was slower(70.4 % in shaken sample and 68.7 % in semistatic
samples after 48 h). After 96 h of experiment, difference
between results reached for both strains in semistatic1846, Page 6 of 13 Water Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:1846020406080100120

(after 120 h) strain SDz3 completely removed dyesmixture (Fig. 2b,c). In static conditions, final removal
of mixture was lower, 91.2 % for strain Sz6 and 81 % for
SDz3. These results were similar to the brilliant greenremoval in static sample by both strains and were lower
than Evans blue decolourisation effect (Fig. 2a).
Decolourisation of mixture, as well as individual testeddyes was faster in case of strain Sz6.
High decolourisation potential of Pseudomonas
strains for dyes decolourisation is presented in literature.Chen ( 2002 )u s e d Pseudomonas luteola for
decolourisation of reactive azo dyes. He proved that this
process is connected with azoreductase enzyme activityand oxygen sensitive. Silveira et al. ( 2009)u s e di nt h e
experiment three different Pseudomonas species for
decolourisation of 14 industrial textile dyes. The exper-
iment was done under static anoxic conditions and
proved high decolourisation potential of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa andPseudomonas oleovorans . Anotherstudy with Pseudomonas strains was carried by Wu
et al. ( 2009). Decolourisation of azo and tripenymethane
(TPM) dyes was examined. Crystal violet, malachite
green and brilliant green (TPM) were almost completely
removed by Pseudomonas otitidis WL-13 up to concen-
tration 100 μmoll
−1, where methyl red and Congo red
(azo dyes) were removed in less than 45 % when were
present in sample in concentration 10 μmoll−1(12 h
experiment). Jadhav et al. ( 2010) studied the bacterial
consortium composed from three Pseudomonas species
in the experiment with azo dyes. Consortium had betterdecolourisation results than pure cultures. One of the
strains ( Pseudomonas sp. SUK1) used in studies de-
scribe above was also examined by Kalyani et al.(2009 ). The experiment was done with azo Reactive
Red 2 in static conditions. Tested Pseudomonas strain
was capable utilise toxic RR2 in concentration 5gl

more than 70 % after 108 h and more than 90 % in
concentration 2gl−1during 48 h. This strain decolorized
with a great results azo dyes mixture. Decolourisation

ined by Jadhav et al. ( 2011). Monochloro-sulphonated
azo dye Remazol Red was degraded up to 97 % within
20 min. in static conditions.
Dead biomass was used for evaluation of sorption
(Fig. 3). Sorption of dyes mixture by Sz6 was approx-
imately 9 %. The best results of dye sorption were
noticed in samples with dyes mixture with strain SDz3(from 44 % after 1 h up to 58.4 % dye removal after
120 h). As it is visible on Fig. 4, interaction between azo
Evans blue and triphenylmethane brilliant green in mix-ture was observed. UV-Visible spectral scans (Fig. 4)
show the displacement of major peak to 591 nm.
Probably, this phenomenon caused higher sorption ofdyes mixture by strain SDz3. These results were sur-
prising because so high sorption was not observed in
sample with individual dyes. For strain SDz3, sorption
of brilliant green after 120 h was approximately 20 %,
Evans blue approximately 10 % and for stain Sz6 ap-proximately 8 and 12 %, respectively. Explanation of
this phenomenon observed for dye mixture is difficult.
Maybe it is connected with differences in quality andquantity of exopolysaccharides exuded by both testedstrains what may influence on dyes sorption abilities
when interaction between dyes happens. Wu et al.(2009) reported high effectiveness of dye removal by
Pseudomonas otitidis WL-13 connected with adsorp-
tion on the biomass. Strain removed 95 % of brilliantgreen and malachite green in concentration
500μmol l
−1after 12 h.
3.3 Toxicity Evaluation
Zootoxicity as well as phytotoxicity (Table 2)w e r ea l s o
evaluated. Generally, zootoxicity and phytotoxicity afterdecolourisation process were lower or at the same level
as in controls sample with dyes. Only in case of strain
Sz6 with Evans blue incubated in static conditionszootoxicity increased from IV to V class. In these sam-
ples, complete decolourisation was observed and as it
was suggested above transformation of azo dyes byazoreductases to toxic aromatic amines. In spite of high
effectiveness of Evans blue removal in semistatic and
shaken conditions, zootoxicity was at the same level asin control sample. In sample with dead biomass, remov-
al reached less than 15 % but the zootoxicity decreased

metabolites were produced during Evans blue biotrans-
formation by strain Sz6. In opposite to Sz6 in samples
with SDz3, significant decrease of zootoxicity was ob-served (from IV to III class).
Franciscon et al. ( 2009a ) reported that under
microaerophilic conditions, toxicity of metabolites ofazo dyes transformed by Staphylococcus arlettae for
Daphnia magna decreased and in aerated samples, no
toxicity was detected. The same results were reached by
Franciscon et al. ( 2009b )f o rKlebsiella sp. strain VN-31.High effectiveness of brilliant green removal by liv-
ing biomass (>77 %) was connected with significant
decrease of zootoxicity (from V to IV or III class).
Third class of zootoxicity was estimated in static andsemistatic samples with SDz3 and semistatic with Sz6.
Slight adsorption of brilliant green by dead biomass of
SDz3 resulted in decrease of zootoxicity to III classwhen samples with dead biomass of Sz6 were extremely
toxic (V class). Our previous study (Przystas et al. 2012)
showed that bacterial decolourisation of brilliant green

bResults of toxicity of Evans blue decolourization end-products were published in Zab łocka-Godlewska et al. 20121846, Page 10 of 13 Water Air Soil Pollut (2014) 225:1846leads to decrease of zootoxicity but phytotoxicity was at
the same level.
Dyes mixture was also effectively removed by
living biomass of tested strains, and in all samples
after 120 h of experiment, decrease of zootoxicitywas observed (from V to IV class in case of strain
Sz6, regardless of incubation method). High effec-
tiveness of colour removal by strain SDz3 insemistatic and static conditions as well as by dead
biomass caused decrease of zootoxicity to III class.
Shaking connected with oxygenation of samplesmight change the metabolic pathway of dyes trans-
formation that is why no so significant decrease was
noticed. Even if decolourisation is very high, metabolitesproduced during the process might be different.
Lemna minor was more resistant to dyes as well as
to bacterial metabolites. High removal of dyes mix-
ture had no influence on phytotoxicity. Effective
removal of brilliant green was connected with thedecrease of phytotoxic ity in samples with shaken
biomass of strains Sz6 as well as strain SDz3 (III class),
static samples with the same strain (II class) anddead biomass of strain Sz6 (even to II class of
toxicity). Samples with Evans blue were classified
even to I class of phytotoxicity (Sz6 and SDz3incubated in static and semistatic conditions).
Other samples (including dead biomass of both
strains) were classified the same as controls to IIIclass of phytotoxicity.
Findings of Cui et al. ( 2012 ) suggest that the
biodegradation products of azo dyes transformationby bacterial consortia are less toxic to plants
(Brassica pekinensis ) than tested dyes. It proves
that bacterial decolourisation of azo dyes can leadto their detoxification. Sheth and Dave ( 2009 )
reported that metabolites of Reactive Red biodeg-
radation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa NGKCTS
did not inhibit growth of soil microorganisms.
Jadhav et al. ( 2010 ) reported no changes in DNA
damage after decolourisation of mixture of reactiveazo dyes by Pseudomonas consortium and weaker
inhibition of seeds germination in samples with
dyes metabolites. Decolourisation of Evans blueand brilliant green mixtur e by fungal strains was
e v a l u a t e db yP r z y s t a śet al. ( 2013 ). Decrease of
zootoxicity after treatment was noticed for all test-ed modifications and strains. In case of phytotox-
icity, decrease was observed only in samples treat-
ed by single strains.4 Conclusions
The present study of dyes decolourisation confirms high
decolourisation effectiveness of Evans blue (EB), bril-
liant green (BG) and mixture (Mix) of them by twoPseudomonas strains (Sz6 and SDz3) isolated from
different sites. Incubation conditions affected the rate
of decolourisation. The best results were reached inshaken and semistatic samples. After 24 h of experiment
in semistatic samples, BG removal reached up to
95.4 %, EB 72.8 % and dyes mixture 88.9 %. After120 h, all tested dyes were completely removed. In most
cases, strain Sz6 removed dyes faster and better than
SDz3. Decrease of phyto- and zootoxicity of samplesafter 120 h was observed. Such results confirm possible
usage of isolated strains to effective, cheap and environ-
mental safe dyes removal also if they are present in
wastewater in mixture.
