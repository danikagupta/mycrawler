African trypanosomes are major pathogens of humans and livestock and represent a model for studies of unusual
protozoal biology. We describe a high-throughput phenotyping approach termed RNA interference (RNAi) target
sequencing, or RIT-seq that, using Illumina sequencing, maps fitness-costs associated with RNAi. We scored theabundance of >90,000 integrated RNAi targets recovered from trypanosome libraries before and after induction of
RNAi. Data are presented for 7435 protein coding sequences, >99% of a non-redundant set in the Trypanosoma brucei
genome. Analysis of bloodstream and insect life-cycle stages and differentiated libraries revealed genome-scaleknockdown profiles of growth and development, linking thousands of previously uncharacterized and ‘‘hypothetical’’genes to essential functions. Genes underlying prominent features of trypanosome biology are highlighted, including
the constitutive emphasis on post-transcriptional gene expression control, the importance of flagellar motility and
glycolysis in the bloodstream, and of carboxylic acid metabolism and phosphorylation during differentiation from thebloodstream to the insect stage. The current data set also provides much needed genetic validation to identify new drug
targets. RIT-seq represents a versatile new tool for genome-scale functional analyses and for the exploitation of genome
sequence data.

With 60 million people at risk, ;30,000 deaths per year, and ad-
ditional livestock infections, the neglected tropical diseases caused
by the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei , have a major
impact across sub-Saharan Africa (Simarro et al. 2008). Thesetsetse-fly transmitted protozoan parasites diverged early from the
eukaryotic lineage (Sogin et al. 1989) and represent the most ge-
netically tractable organism within the Excavate domain.
Trypanosomatids display ‘‘unusual’’ molecular and biochemi-
cal features relative to their hosts and other, more intensively
studied, eukaryotes. These include compartmentalized glycolysis
(Michels et al. 2006), a single motile flagellum with a paraflagellar
rod (Ralston et al. 2009; Portman and Gull 2010), a complex mi-
tochondrial DNA structure known as the kinetoplast (Shlomai
2004), and extensive editing of kinetoplast-encoded mRNA tran-
scripts (Stuart et al. 2005). In the nucleus, transcription is poly-
cistronic and all mRNA transcripts are trans -spliced (Martinez-
Calvillo et al. 2010). In addition, the African trypanosome undergoesantigenic variation of abundant glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI) anchored (Smith and Butikofer 2010) coat proteins, which is
important to maintain an infection (Horn and McCulloch 2010).Environmental adaptation associated with transmission via thetsetse fly requires major developmental change in surface archi-
tecture and energy metabolism in particular (Fenn and Matthews
2007). In spite of these potential targets, current antitrypanosomal
therapies suffer from problems of toxicity and limited efficacy
(Wilkinson and Kelly 2009), and there is little prospect of a vaccine
due to antigenic variation (Deitsch et al. 2009).
The TriTryp ( T. brucei ,T. cruzi, and Leishmania major ) genome
sequences were reported in 2005 (Berriman et al. 2005; El-Sayed
et al. 2005a; Ivens et al. 2005) and comparative analysis revealed
a high degree of synteny (El-Sayed et al. 2005b). The T. brucei ge-
nome sequence (Berriman et al. 2005) is a haploid mosaic of the 11diploid chromosomes and comprises ;3310
7bp. Protein coding
sequences are 1592 bp on average with a GC-content of 50% andintergenic regions are 1279 bp on average. Introns and cis-splicing
are extremely rare and cotranscribed genes are not generallyfunctionally related. A non-redundant set of protein-coding se-
quences comprises ;7500 genes with 64% of these annotated
‘‘hypothetical.’’ Full exploitation of the TriTryp genome sequencesrequires the continued development of versatile approaches for
genome-scale functional analyses. RNA interference (RNAi) me-
diated knockdown has proven to be an excellent functional anal-
ysis tool for T. brucei but has been largely limited to a piecemeal
gene-by-gene approach (Subramaniam et al. 2006). We present an
RNAi target sequencing (RIT-seq) approach that provides a high-
resolution genomic scale readout of fitness following RNAi
knockdown. Access to RIT-seq data for almost all T. brucei genes and
to genetic ‘‘profiles’’ that reflect trypanosome biology should guidefuture research and facilitate drug-target prioritization efforts.Present addresses:3Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford Science

High-throughput parallel RNAi target sequencing
Illumina sequencing can be used to survey the representation of
genetically distinct cells in a complex population (Langridge et al.
2009; van Opijnen et al. 2009) and we reasoned that this could be
applied to RNAi-based phenotyping studies. To improve coverage,
and critically, to optimize the reproducibility of knockdown, we
used a meganuclease-based system (Glover and Horn 2009) to
target RNAi cassettes to a single genomic locus validated for robust
expression (Alsford et al. 2005). Briefly, an RNAi plasmid library,
containing randomly sheared genomic fragments (Morris et al.
2002), was used to create an inducible library in bloodstream form
T. brucei (Fig. 1). After transfection, the library was grown under
non-inducing and inducing conditions (Fig. 2A) and genomicDNA was isolated from populations that survived induction for the
equivalent of approximately nine to 20 population doubling times
(see Methods). Adaptor-ligated sequencing libraries were prepared
from each genomic DNA sample and used to amplify DNA frag-
ments containing RNAi cassette-insert junctions in semi-specific
PCR reactions; one primer was specific for the RNAi vector and the
other for the Illumina adapter (Fig. 2B). Size-selected DNA was
sequenced with 76 cycle paired-end runs on an Illumina GAII.
Illumina sequencing reads containing a nine-base RNAi vector
junction sequence were then mapped to the T. brucei referencegenome using the SSAHA sequence alignment algorithm (Ninget al. 2001). As expected, we found no preferential representation
of genomic fragments corresponding to protein-coding or non-
coding regions in the uninduced population. Under inducing
conditions, cytocidal or cytostatic defects diminish RNAi-target
sequence representation relative to the expanding bulk population,
revealing ‘‘cold spots’’ that correspond to predicted mRNA se-
quences (Fig. 3). We could thus deduce knockdown-associated loss-
of-fitness phenotypes from these cold spots.
We examined four different induced samples (Figs. 2A, 3):
bloodstream-form cells grown for three (BF
D3) or six days (BFD6),
insect/procyclic-form cells (PF), and cells induced throughoutgrowth as bloodstream forms, differentiation and growth as pro-
cyclic forms (DIF). In the present study, we focused on protein-
coding sequences (CDS) and scored the number of reads mapping
to each of these regions in each experiment. This allowed identi-
fication of the ‘‘core essential genomic loci,’’ where mRNA ablation
is associated with loss-of-fitness in all four induced conditions
(blue in Figs. 2A, 3), genes associated with more pronounced de-
fects as bloodstream cells (red in Figs. 2A, 3) or as procyclic cells
(green in Figs. 2A, 3), and genes associated with a differentiation
defect (purple in Figs. 2A, 3).
RIT-seq digital data analysis and validation
We obtained counts of reads mapping to each CDS in each con-dition. Reads from a pair of replicate sequencing libraries yielded
a correlation coefficient of R
2=0.98 (data not shown), indicating
excellent reproducibility for library preparation, amplification,sequencing, and mapping. Examination of these RIT-seq digital
data (Supplemental File 1A) readily revealed groups of genes as-
sociated with loss-of-fitness in either bloodstream or procyclic cells
or loss-of-fitness in both life-cycle stages, and examples of each of
these are shown in the scatter-plots in Figure 4A. Several additional
groups of genes associated with loss-of-fitness in the BF
D3experi-
ment are highlighted in Supplemental Figure S1. The number ofreads per CDS from each of the four induced experiments was then
compared with the uninduced condition using the DEGseq R
package (Wang et al. 2010). We used the Z-score for statistical
analysis and the Boolean (TRUE | FALSE) reports to find significantchanges in reads mapped to each CDS (Supplemental File 1A). In
the uninduced population, mapped sequence reads represented
>90,000 independent RNAi target fragments, equivalent to >5
targets and >550 reads for each CDS. There are ;7500 non-re-
dundant protein-coding sequences predicted in the assembled
T. brucei genome and we obtained data for 7435 ( >99%) of these.
Significant loss-of-fitness was reported for 1908 and 2724 CDS inthe 3- and 6-d bloodstream form time-course, respectively, 1972
CDS in the procyclics and 2677 CDS in induced and differentiated
cells (see Fig. 4B). All Z-scores, in heat-map format, are presented
on physical maps of each of the eleven T. brucei megabase chro-
mosomes in Supplemental Figure S2.
To further validate the RIT-seq approach, we examined genes
associated with the essential function of translation and cohorts ofgenes that were previously characterized, including potential drug
targets (Fig. 4C; Supplemental File 1B). Factors associated with
translation, with a previously reported lethal phenotype following
RNAi in at least one life-cycle stage, and drug targets all displayed
a pronounced mean loss-of-fitness in each of the four experiments.
In contrast, genes known to be dispensable for growth in at least one
life-cycle stage failed to display a pronounced mean loss-of-fitness
in any experiment. Four of these dispensable genes did display

presses the tetracycline repressor (TetR) and T7 phage RNA polymerase

expression. ( B) RNAi plasmid library constructs replace the I-SceI gene and

greatest reduction in read-count was eightfold compared to unin-
duced for RAD51-5 and this is entirely consistent with the de-
creased growth rate reported for RAD51-5 null strains (Proudfoot
and McCulloch 2005). For each gene, we applied a four-set binary
coding system that reflected the output from the DEGseq package
in each of the induced experiments (Fig. 4D). This allowed us toidentify 750 genes associated with significant loss-of-fitness in all
four experiments (0-0-0-0 genes), 437 genes associated with loss-
of-fitness in the three experiments involving growth as blood-
stream form cells (0-0-1-0 genes), 219 genes associated with loss-
of-fitness in the pair of experiments involving growth as procyclic
cells (1-1-0-0 genes), and 545 genes associated with loss-of-fitness
only in differentiated cells (1-1-1-0 genes).

quence, GCCTCGCGA, were mapped. The box shows a sample region with sequence mapping frequency viewed in Artemis (Carver et al. 2008); each
peak represents a unique RNAi target fragment.
Figure 3. Example plots in Artemis of the four different loss-of-fitness patterns illustrated in Figure 2; mRNA ablation is associated with a defect in all four
induced conditions (blue), a more pronounced defect in bloodstream form cells (red) or procyclic cells (green), or a differentiation defect (purple). Cells
carrying RNAi target fragments that negatively impact fitness through dsRNA expression and RNAi-mediated ablation are relatively depleted as thepopulation expands and these changes are reported by the depth of sequence coverage relative to the uninduced control (no Tet). Each peak represents
a unique RNAi target fragment. The genes shown encode a dynein heavy chain (Tb927.4.870), an intraflagellar transport protein (Tb927.10.14470),
dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (Tb927.10.7570), and an uncharacterized zinc ion binding protein (Tb09.160.265).RIT-seq in trypanosomes
Genome Research 917
www.genome.org Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on August 29, 2024 - Published by genome.cshlp.org Downloaded from The analysis above indicates that the RIT-seq outputs report
RNAi induced fitness costs and identify the genes that underlie
these defects at a genomic scale. The outputs also provide func-
tional annotation for the high proportion of T. brucei genes
encoding proteins with no prior functional assignment, many ofwhich are trypanosomatid or species-specific. Among 7435 genes
analyzed, 64% are annotated ‘‘conserved hypothetical’’ (4401) or‘‘hypothetical’’ (388). Of 750 genes that display loss-of-fitness in all
experiments, 370 (49%) were derived from these categories. Thus,
despite significant under-representation ( P<0.0001), approxi-
mately half of essential functions in trypanosomes are encoded by‘‘hypothetical’’ genes. The output also
provides a catalog of new potential drug-
target data; 1187 genes displayed a signifi-
cant loss-of-fitness in all three experiments
involving growth as bloodstream-form
cells (BF
D3,B FD6, and DIF) and can there-
fore now be considered at least partiallyvalidated, genetical ly, as potential tar-
gets. As expected, previously characterizedpotential drug targets, including several
glycolytic enzymes and kinases (Supple-
mental File 1B), were over-represented
(P<0.0001) in this cohort.
RIT-seq for genome-scale profiles
of growth and development
RIT-seq provides data for several thou-
sand individual genes. To study fitness in
the context of functions, processes, and
compartments, we assessed the data interms of Gene Ontology (GO) annota-
tions, which provide structured controlled
vocabularies to describe gene products
(Supplemental File 2). We began by ana-
lyzing GO terms from a GO-slim set that
displayed highly significant ( P<0.01)
over-representation within the cohortof genes displaying loss-of-fitness in all
experiments (Fig. 5A). Core essential
functions such as ‘‘transcription,’’ ‘‘trans-
lation,’’ and ‘‘proteasome’’ are over-rep-
resented in this cohort, as expected. An-
other notable over-represented term was
‘‘RNA binding’’ ( P<0.0001). Since try-
panosomatid genes are arranged in longpolycistronic units transcribed from
strand-switch regions lacking conven-
tional promoters (Siegel et al. 2009), this
output is consistent with the rarity of reg-
ulated transcription and the emphasis on
post-transcriptional control of gene ex-
pression at the level of mRNA stability
and translation. Our results identify 40
RNA-binding proteins that appear to be
essential for growth in both major life-
cycle stages.
We next analyzed the distribution
of genes annotated with the term ‘‘RNA
binding’’ and other groups of genes
thought to contribute to post-transcrip-
tional control of gene expression across the four cohorts high-lighted in Figure 4D. This analysis revealed that ‘‘RNA binding’’
was specifically enriched in the 0-0-0-0 core essential functiongroup (Fig. 5B). In contrast, a high proportion of ZC3H-zinc finger
proteins, which often bind to the 3 9-untranslated regions of
mRNA, were specifically associated with stage or differentiation-specific loss-of-fitness. The larger cohort of ‘‘zinc ion binding’’
proteins was only moderately over-represented in the differentia-
tion-specific loss-of-fitness group. These profiles suggested that
many ZC3H proteins control mRNA subsets at different stages of
the life cycle. There are a large number of kinases encoded in the

genes based on DEG-seq analysis. The binary codes score the output from each of the four experiments
(1–4) in the order indicated, with ‘‘0’’ representing a significant loss-of-fitness. For example ‘‘0-0-1-0’’
genes are associated with a loss-of-fitness in all three experiments involving RNAi induction during
growth as bloodstream-form cells. The DIF experiment involved RNAi induction throughout growth asbloodstream forms, differentiation and growth as procyclic forms, so any gene required for growth in
either life-cycle stage or for differentiation should register a loss-of-fitness in this experiment. The four
cohorts illustrated in Figure 2A and Figure 3 are highlighted (bold colored text).Alsford et al.

activity’’ ( P<0.001) among genes reporting loss-of-fitness in all
experiments suggested a high level of redundancy or an emphasison contingency functions (Fig. 5B). Among this latter group,
however, the cdc2-related kinases were commonly associated with
a significant loss-of-fitness ( P<0.002; see Supplemental Fig. S1J).
Additional GO terms that display the range of possible loss-of-fit-ness profiles are shown in Supplemental Figure S3.
Differentiation from the bloodstream to the insect stage is
accompanied by major developmental changes in metabolism,
surface architecture, and cell-cycle control, but the genes un-derlying these differences remain largely unknown. GO terms as-
sociated with flagellar motility are strikingly over-represented in
the bloodstream loss-of-fitness group and absent in the procyclic
loss-of-fitness group (Fig. 6A). This is consistent with reports of thespecific impact of flagellar motility de-fects on bloodstream-form growth (Ral-
ston et al. 2009; Portman and Gull 2010),
and we identify intraflagellar transport
(P<0.0001; see Fig. 4A) and axonemal
radial spoke proteins ( P<0.0001) as
important players in this differential ef-
fect. Both cohorts of genes encoding
these factors display a pronounced loss-
of-fitness in the bloodstream form (BF
D3)
relative to the procyclic form (Fig. 6B).Motility in bloodstream-form cells may
play a role in cytokinesis or in maintaining
the high rate of traffic and nutrient uptake
via the flagellar pocket (see Field and
Carrington 2009). The proteasome com-
plex is also over-represented in the blood-
stream loss-of-fitness group and absent in
the procyclic loss-of-fitness group (Fig. 6A;
Supplemental Fig. S3). In this case, the
a-ring subunits ( P<0.0001) are primarily
responsible for the effect (Fig. 6B), suggest-ing a particularly important role for this
subcomplex in bloodstream trypanosomes.
Glycolysis operates in peroxisome-
like organelles known as glycosomes
in trypanosomes and is thought to be
the single source of ATP in the blood-
stream (Michels et al. 2006), while theprocess of differentiation to the procyclic-
form is accompanied by elaboration of
mitochondrial cristae and a switch to
oxidative phosphorylation. A constitu-
tive dependence upon the glycosome is
highlighted by over-representation of
this term ( P<0.01) in the GO profile
shown in Figure 5A but, consistent withthe developmental transition, RNAi
against glycolytic enzymes was associated
with a more pronounced defect in the
bloodstream form (Fig. 6C). In contrast,
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) compo-
nents displayed a prominent association
with defects specific to procyclic cells (Fig.
6C,P<0.0001; also see Fig. 4A), suggesting
a particularly important role for fatty acidmetabolism in the insect mid-gut (see van
Weelden et al. 2005). Increased reads associated with knockdown ofthe PDH complex in bloodstream-form cells may indicate a gain-of-
fitness. Gene knockdowns associated with a significant gain-of-fit-
ness in all four experiments number 147, including six genes an-
notated with the GO-term, ATPase activity ( P<0.01, data not
shown). These latter genes play roles in contingency functions suchas DNA repair (Tb11.02.3110) and toxin export (Tb927.8.2160,
Tb11.01.8700) and their expression could retard growth under the
conditions tested. Notably, both ‘‘mitochondrion’’ and ‘‘integral to
membrane’’ are significantly under-represented in the core essential
function and bloodstream loss-of-fitness groups and over-repre-
sented in the procyclic loss-of-fitness and DIF groups (Supplemental
Fig S3; Supplemental File 2). These outputs are likely associated with
the shift to oxidative phosphorylation and surface coat remodeling,
respectively, during differentiation to the insect stage.

that accompany adaptation to the insect host environment could
be targeted in the mammal to reduce virulence or to block trans-
mission. Tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates serve as a trigger for
this developmental transition and a citrate transporter involved in
the process has been identified (Dean et al. 2009), but other factors
involved in this environmental sensing remain largely unknown.
A GO-term profile of the cohort of genes associated with differ-
entiation (Fig. 7A) revealed over-representation of lipid metabolic
process ( P<0.01; also see Supplemental Fig. S3), carboxylic acid
metabolism ( P<0.01), oxidoreductase activity ( P<0.01), and
phosphorylation ( P<0.02). The genes encoding factors implicated
in carboxylic acid transport and propagation of this differentiationsignal are shown (Fig. 7B). We also present the group of genes forwhich RNAi confers a specific gain-of-fitness during differentiation
(Fig. 7B). This latter group comprises only 15 genes and is validated
by the presence of the known differentiation inhibitory kinase,
ZFK (Vassella et al. 2001).Discussion
RNAi libraries and second-generation se-quencing have both revolutionized ge-
nomics studies. We have combined these
tools to map knockdown-associated fit-
ness costs to the predicted protein-coding
sequences of the African trypanosome
genome. This RIT-seq approach reports
a wide dynamic range of RNAi-induced
fitness defects at nucleotide-level reso-
lution and at a genomic scale. RIT-seq
has several advantages over related ap-
proaches. For example, unlike mutagene-
sis approaches, the knockdown approach
is not limited by ploidy and facilitates
the study of genes that are essential for
growth. In addition, microarray-based
approaches can suffer from problems of
cross-hybridization artifacts and a narrow
dynamic range, whereas high-throughput
sequencing has low background noise
and a wide dynamic range (Wilhelm et al.
2008; Montgomery et al. 2010). Known
trypanosome biology is broadly supported
by our RIT-seq data while some findings
could be considered unexpected. For ex-
ample, based on loss-of-fitness profiles,
the full set of kinases may not representa particularly rich source of attractive drug
targets, the proteasome aring may per-
form a function of particular importancein the bloodstream form, and lipid me-
tabolism may be more important for the
differentiation process than previously
appreciated.
The RIT-seq data were validated by
several means but it is worth considering
the parameters that affect data quality,
genome coverage, and the origin of false
positives or false negatives. Parallel anal-
ysis has the advantage that all genes are
tested and analyzed in the same con-
trolled environment, i.e., within a single
culture flask. DNA fragment amplification is also carried out inparallel and the process of mapping sequences back to the refer-
ence genome negates the need to manipulate or monitor large
numbers of samples. Importantly, sequences were only mapped
and counted if they contained a correctly positioned 9-bp ‘‘tag’’
derived from the RNAi expression cassette. We found that ;20% of
these reads failed to map to the assembled reference chromosomes,the majority of which likely derive from repetitive subtelomeric
regions (Berriman et al. 2005). More than 99% of the non-re-
dundant gene-set was represented and the data set includes more
than five RNAi target fragments per gene on average, indicating
excellent genome coverage in the library and the RIT-seq readout.
Cloning or amplification artifacts can be a particular problem
when manipulating (G +C) biased genomes (Kozarewa et al. 2009)
but, in the current case, T. brucei protein coding sequences present
a( G+C) content of 50%, amplification was kept to a minimum, and
quantitative PCR was used for normalization (see Methods). Al-though the average number of reads per protein coding sequence

short genes with less coverage. Regulated repression of an RNAi
cassette can be insufficient to prevent expression of toxic amounts
of dsRNA in some cases (Alibu et al. 2005) and this could lead to
under-representation of certain essential genes in a T. brucei library,
but we see no evidence for this problem when using the currentsystem (see aandb-tubulin and the clathrin heavy chain, for
example Tb927.1.2340, Tb927.1.2330, and Tb927.10.6050, re-spectively, in Supplemental File 1A).
Using the RIT-seq approach, false negatives, where a growth
defect should be observed but is not detected, could arise due toinsufficient dsRNA expression from the RNAi construct. False
positives, where a growth defect should not be observed but is
detected, could arise primarily through off-target effects. Somesuch effects can be tolerated here due tofivefold coverage. The use of a library con-
taining RNAi target fragments with a mean
length of 600 bp also represents a balance
between minimizing false negatives, due
to short target fragments with reduced
RNAi potency, and minimizing false
positives, due to the targeting of two ad-
jacent genes by any single fragment. The
long dsRNAs generate a pool of hetero-
geneous small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs)
that mediate sequence-specific destruc-
tion of the cognate mRNA. This is thought
to increase the knockdown effect and, at
the same time, dilute off-target effects of
any individual siRNA. To further minimize
false negatives due to position effects,
we used a meganuclease-based system
whereby the vast majority of RNAi cas-
settes are integrated at a locus validated
for reproducible and robust inducible
expression (Alsford et al. 2005; Glover
and Horn 2009). This approach also
minimizes the off-target effects that can
occur following integration at unex-
pected locations in the genome (Motyka
et al. 2004). Revertants with a rearranged
or otherwise dysfunctional RNAi cassette
would not be expected to produce falsenegatives, because they arise at low fre-
quency and because many will lack the
template for sequencing (Chen et al.
2003).
The RIT-seq output reflects the ‘‘di-
vision of labor’’ among various protein
classes in T. brucei . For example, among
RNA-binding proteins and protein ki-nases, 40 (22%) and 9 (5%), respectively,
appear to be essential for growth in both
major life-cycle stages, while 14 (30%) of
the ZC3H zinc-finger proteins are impli-
cated in life-cycle stage specific growth or
the process of differentiation. By pro-
viding a controlled vocabulary, GO terms
allow for a standardized representation of
gene product attributes across species and
databases. Currently only 38% of T. brucei
genes are associated with any GO-term
annotation but our findings indicate that GO terms are excellent
tools for the analysis of RIT-seq data sets. Progress in GO-term
annotation, facilitated by new findings, will undoubtedly reveal
additional GO terms associated with essential processes in try-
panosomes. Meanwhile, groups of genes significantly over-repre-
sented in the cohorts analyzed here present opportunities for
further research; 38 such associations are shown in Figures 5–7,
and an additional 23 ( P<0.05) are highlighted in Supplemental
File 2.
Although about 80% of yeast genes can be deleted with no
obvious phenotypic consequence in rich medium, almost all yeastgenes contribute to optimal growth under a variety of stress con-
ditions (Hillenmeyer et al. 2008). In the current study, 25%–37% of
T. brucei genes appear to be required for optimal growth in each

Genome Research 921
www.genome.org Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on August 29, 2024 - Published by genome.cshlp.org Downloaded from experiment. This is consistent with a chromosome-wide knock-
down analysis of genes on T. brucei chromosome 1 that revealed
growth defects for 23% of those genes (45/197) in the bloodstreamform (Subramaniam et al. 2006). By comparing our RIT-seq ex-
periments, we show that knockdown of 10% of genes is associated
with a loss-of-fitness in all experiments and that knockdown of
43% of genes is not associated with a loss-of-fitness in any exper-
iment. Consistent with our use of optimized growth conditions,
the GO-term, response to stress, is under-represented or absent in
all four loss-of-fitness cohorts analyzed above (see Supplemental
File 2 and Supplemental Fig. S3). This output also indicates that
a3 7 °Ct o2 7 °C temperature shift, used to trigger differentiation,
does not constitute a stress for trypanosomes. Thus, like yeast,many trypanosome genes may only contribute to optimal growth
under suboptimal conditions.
The current data set will greatly facilitate the identification of
attractive drug targets in this neglected-disease pathogen. There
are;100 genes annotated as ‘‘lethal’’ following RNAi in T. brucei
but more than half of these have only been analyzed in insect-stagecells (Supplemental File 1B). Our RIT-seq analysis reveals more
than one thousand genes that can now be considered genetically
validated potential targets in bloodstream-form parasites. This will
greatly aid prioritization efforts using open-access tools such as
those found at http://TDRtargets.org/ (Crowther et al. 2010).
In summary, the RIT-seq output provides genome-scale fitness
data under a variety of growth conditions. The GO-term analysis
and genetic profiles recapitulate known features, thereby validating
the approach, and identify new features. In every case, the genes
that underlie essential features of trypanosome biology are nowrevealed. The current data set and resources should accelerate dis-
covery in understanding the biology of these important patho-
gens, and should also facilitate drug-target prioritization efforts.
Finally, the RIT-seq approach we describe here is versatile and can
be widely applied beyond trypanosomes. With a contextual out-
put, responses to a range of environments and selective pressures
can be assessed.
Methods
T. brucei growth and manipulation
Bloodstream-form T. brucei , MiTat 1.2, clone 221a cells were
maintained (Alsford et al. 2005) and transfected by electroporation
as described (Glover and Horn 2009) except that cytomix was usedfor all transfections other than for library generation. Sce* cellswere checked for I-SceI-facilitated transfection efficiency and val-
idated for robust tetracycline (Tet)-regulated (1 mgm L
/C01)tubulin
RNAi; using this system, we obtained >250,000 transformants/
experiment and >90% morphologically FAT cells (Ngo et al. 1998)
after 24 h induction. Differentiation to the procyclic-stage wastriggered in vitro by transferring the cells to glucose-free DTM
medium (Overath et al. 1986) supplemented with citrate and cis-
aconitate at 27 °C. Note that the differentiation process displays
some differences dependent upon the strain analyzed (Fenn and
Matthews 2007); the current strain is ‘‘monomorphic.’’ BF
D3,B FD6,
PF, and DIF cultures were maintained throughout as populations
of>53106cells and grown under inducing conditions for the
equivalent of ;10, 20, 9, and 13 (7 +6) population doubling (PD)
times, respectively (1PD ;7 h for BF cells and ;24 h for PF cells).
Plasmid construction and strain assembly
pT7BLAand pRPaSce*were used to derive Sce* cells from 2T1 cells
(Alsford et al. 2005). pT7BLAreplaced a BLEgene with a BLA geneand added a T7 RNA polymerase gene at the tubulin /TetR locus on
chromosome 1 while pRPaSce*added the homing endonuclease
gene and cleavage site to the tagged rRNA spacer locus on chro-
mosome 2. pT7BLAwas constructed by replacing an MluI-BstZ171
fragment and a SmaI-RsrII fragment in pLew13 with a MluI-SmaI
fragment from pAZA and a PCR-amplified BLA fragment, re-
spectively. pRPaSce*was constructed by cloning an I-SceI coding
sequence in the pRPaTAGvector (Alsford and Horn 2008) and en-
gineering an I-SceI cleavage site at the Bsp120I site. pT7BLAwas
digested with EcoRV-NsiI prior to transfection. Full oligonucleo-
tide details are available on request.
Library construction
The estimated 11 3genome-coverage (complexity of 500,000
fragments) RNAi plasmid library (Morris et al. 2002) comprised
randomly sheared genomic DNA (mean ;600 bp) cloned in
a vector for the Tet-inducible expression of dsRNA. Our ;750,000-
clone T. brucei library was constructed in the Sce* strain (Fig. 1)
using 30 mg plasmid DNA with three transfections using an
AMAXA Nucleofector 3 h after Tet-addition (Glover and Horn
2009). Tet was removed during the transfection procedure. Tovalidate the library, we amplified RNAi inserts from a small numberof clones and confirmed random distribution of targets across the
genome.
DNA sequencing
For paired-end Illumina sequencing, we took ;8mg of genomic
DNA from each sample and prepared standard Illumina sequenc-ing libraries, with a mean insert size of 250 bp, up to the point of
adaptor ligation (Bentley et al. 2008). We then normalized theseadaptor-ligated libraries by qPCR, by reference to a dilution se-
ries of a standard library. Reactions were set up as follows:
Ad_T_qPCR1: 59 -CTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTC-3 9(desalted),
Ad_B_qPCR2: 5 9-ATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTC-3 9(desalted), 2 3
SybrGreen Master Mix, 10 mM Syb_FP5, 10 mM Syb_RP7, 1/100 3
ligated library DNA in an Applied Biosystems Step One Plus qPCRmachine, using the default cycling conditions. To amplify DNAfragments containing the RNAi cassette-insert junction, we used500 ng of ligated library DNA quantified in this way in semi-
specific PCR reactions. We performed 22 cycles of PCR, with a
67.5 °C annealing temp and 40 sec extension step, using a forward
primer that consisted of a RNAi cassette-specific 3 9end, tailed with
the Illumina P5 sequence (bold): TbrF1: 5 9-AATGATACGGCG
ACCACCGAGATCTACAC CCTGCAGGAATTCGATATCAAG-3 9and
a custom reverse primer that annealed to the Illumina adapter atthe 39end and which was tailed with the Illumina P7 sequence
(bold): V3.3: 5 9-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT CGGTAC
ACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT- 3 9.
Following amplification, we cleaned each product using a
spin column (Qiagen) and ran the entire eluate from each col-
umn in one lane of a 2% agarose gel at 5V cm
/C01for 30 min in 1 3
TBE. We excised a gel band corresponding to a fragment size of
;400 bp and extracted the DNA (Quail et al. 2008). We quantified
products by SYBRGreen qPCR (Quail et al. 2009) and sequenced
them with a 76 cycle paired-end run, on an Illumina GAII, using
a custom sequencing primer for read 1: TbrR1SF1: 5 9-GAATTCGAT
ATCAAGCTTGGCCTGTGAG-3 9and the Illumina read 1 sequenc-
ing primer for read 2: Illumina read 1: 5 9-ACACTCTTTCCCTACAC
GACGCTCTTCCGATCT-3 9.
Informatics
Paired-end Illumina sequencing reads for each condition weremapped to the T. brucei 927 reference genome (Berriman et al.Alsford et al.
922 Genome Research
www.genome.org Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on August 29, 2024 - Published by genome.cshlp.org Downloaded from 2005) as follows: Sequences containing a terminal RNAi-vector
junction sequence (GCCTCGCGA, one ‘‘mismatch’’ tolerated)
were trimmed to remove nine bases from the beginning of read 1and a similar number of bases from the end of read 2, giving a finallength of 67 bases. Reads were then mapped with SSAHA2 (Ning
et al. 2001) using a kmer size of 40. After mapping, we obtained
coverage and uniqueness plots and, for each CDS, a count of readsmapping uniquely, applying a normalization factor of five million
reads for all technical replicates and for all conditions. The number
of reads mapping to each CDS in each induced condition wascompared with the uninduced condition using the DEGseq Rpackage typically used to normalize transcriptome data sets (Wang
et al. 2010). In this case, we carried out pairwise comparisons with
each induced sample and the uninduced control and used theZ-score and the Boolean (TRUE | FALSE) reports to find significant
changes in reads mapped to each CDS. A mechanism used by
trypanosomatids to compensate for the general lack of transcrip-
tional control is to duplicate genes in tandem. Since these se-quences were excluded from the unique mapping set, we repeated
the normalization and DEGseq analysis with the repetitive (raw)
read count for all CDS. Uninformative data sets for tandem geneswere extracted and replaced with raw data for 157 genes (Supple-mental File 1C), each considered to be representative of a tandem.
Pseudogenes, genes annotated as ‘‘hypothetical unlikely’’ and re-
petitive VSG, expression-site associated and retrotransposon hot-
spot gene families were excluded from the analysis. Gene cohortswere assembled and analyzed using TriTrypDB (http://tritrypdb.
org/), GeneDB (http://www.genedb.org/), GOToolbox (http://
genome.crg.es/GOToolBox/) (Martin et al. 2004), and a GenericGO slim set (http://geneontology.org/) with eleven terms added to
capture key features of trypanosome biology. P-values were calcu-
lated using a x
2test.
