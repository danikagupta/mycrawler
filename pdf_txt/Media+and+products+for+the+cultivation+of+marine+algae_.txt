OceanicAbstract
There has been increasing interest in Alaska regarding the com-
mercial mariculture of kelp. Kelp farming can be an economic
engine for coastal communities of Alaska. Other benefitsinclude ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and
mitigation of eutrophication. I n support of this interest, several
kelp species have been examined for commercial potential. In
the 1980s –1990s, experiments were performed on the giant
kelp Macrocystis pyrifera . Female gametophytes were exposed
to varying levels of chelated iron. Relatively low levels of che-
lated iron (1 –5μM) stimulated the onset of oogenesis. In con-
trast, higher iron concentratio ns inhibited egg production.
Outplant experiments with Macrocystis in Sitka, AK showed
growth in the winter and spring, slowing down to zero growth
by the end of summer. Fertilizing outplants in August allowed
plants to survive and grow during the ensuing winter. Maricul-ture experiments with Saccharina latissima carried out near
Juneau, Alaska showed exponential growth for seeded lines
set out from September to Mar ch. Optimal growth occurred
for outplants in October –N o v e m b e r ,w i t hg r o w t hr a t e so fu p
to 5% per day. The best growth occurred when lines were2–3 m below the surface. Growth rates declined in May –June
corresponding to a decrease in inorganic nitrogen in the water.
Slower growth also resulted in severe fouling.

Although global seaweed mariculture has a long history with a more or less steady increase in value over the last few
decades, with production in 2018 over 30 million tons worth about 13 billion USD (FAO, 2020), the commercial cul-
ture of seaweeds in the United States has only recently been active (Kim, Stekoll, & Yarish, 2019). In Alaska, for sev-
eral years, there have been commercial harvests of natural beds of seaweeds, mostly for the herring spawn-on-kelpmarket but also for other products such as plant fertilizer supplements and various bull kelp ( Nereocystis luetkeana
[K.Mertens] Postels & Ruprecht) products for human consumption (Stekoll, 2019). It is only in the last few years that
any commercial mariculture production of seaweeds in Alaska has occurred (ADF&G, 2020). To date, production inAlaska has focused on the species Saccharina latissima (Linnaeus) C. E. Lane, C. Mayes, Druehl & G. W. Saunders;
Alaria marginata Postels & Ruprecht; and Nereocystis luetkeana .
The first published research on the mariculture of kelps in Alaska was carried out with Laminaria groenlandica
(Saccharina groenlandica ) by placing ropes along the bottom of the ocean in Auke Bay, AK, with plants naturally rec-
ruited from nearby beds (Ellis & Calvin, 1981). Subsequent research on kelps was conducted on the mariculture of
the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh (as Macrocystis integrifolia ) for use in the herring spawn-on-
kelp fishery in Alaska (Stekoll, 1989; Stekoll & Else, 1990) and the research that is reported here.
Currently, the lack of understanding of the optimization of kelp cultivation is one bottleneck that impedes industry
growth in Alaska, partially because of the unique species present and also because the oceanography is different from
other geographic areas where kelp is already produced through mariculture practices. Gaps in knowledge exist in both thehatchery production of seed and also in the cultivation of sporophytes on the ocean farm. Here, we present applied mari-
culture research conducted on the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera in the 1990s and Saccharina latissima in 2015 –2018. The aim
of this research is to provide key information to help optimize the developing kelp mariculture industry, focusing on hatch-ery practices utilizing iron and optimizing outplant depth and outplant dates of sporophytes in the ocean farm setting.
In the 1980s and 1990s, a series of experiments was conducted on Macrocystis pyrifera to examine iron as a tool
for hatchery seeding and to examine optimal sporophyte-growing conditions in an ocean farm setting. An important
aspect of kelp mariculture is the ability to control the timing of the development of the organism. In kelp mariculture,one way to do this is to control when the gametophytes become fertile and produce young sporelings. It has been
reported that growing Laminariaceae gametophytes in red light (Lüning, 1980) or without iron in the media
(Motomura & Sakai, 1981) will inhibit gametogenesis. Here, we report on how iron affects oogenesis in Macrocystis .
Some of this research has been previously reported (Stekoll, 1989; Stekoll & Else, 1990), along with work on
other species (Raymond & Stekoll, 2021). Here, we give the results of additional research on Macrocystis that was
performed in the 1990s. Later, in 2015 –2019, experiments were conducted on Saccharina latissima to examine the
optimization of sporophyte growth in an ocean farm setting. We present the results from both species to provide a
framework for industry members to optimize hatchery operations and ocean farm practices with the aim of expedit-
ing economic prosperity for the mariculture industry of Alaska and providing additional ecosystem services to coastalcommunities associated with kelp mariculture.
2|MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 |Hatchery optimization: Iron and oogenesis in Macrocystis pyrifera gametophytes
To evaluate the effect of iron on gametogenesis in female gametophytes, we carried out experiments on a single
female clone of Macrocystis pyrifera in a medium with and without added iron. Macrocystis spores were obtained
from sporophylls collected from Sitka, Alaska in 1983 and sent by air to the University of California at Santa Barbara.Single spores were isolated, and a single female gametophyte strain (designated as Mi-T-19) was selected for long-
term culture. Culture media were either modified Provasoli's enriched seawater (Provasoli, 1968) or enriched artificial
seawater (EASW) (Harrison, Waters, & Taylor, 1980). Provasoli enrichment solution was modified by the addition of1032 STEKOLL ET AL.
iodine at a level of 1.4 mg/L in the stock solution, by the elimination of iron and vitamins, and —in some cases —by the
omission of the Tris buffer. The artificial seawater was enriched with the same enrichment solution used in the
enriched natural seawater. Fe-EDTA solutions were made using ferric (iron III) ammonium sulfate and disodiumethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in a 1:1 M ratio. Stock solutions of Fe-EDTA were made at 0.1 mg Fe/ml
(1.8 mM). All iron concentrations are those used in the initial formulation. For each set of experiments, the following
general procedure was used. Bulk cultures of Macrocystis gametophytes were grown in EASW with no added iron at
15
/C14C under cool white fluorescent lighting (16:8 L:D photoperiod) at an irradiance of 40 –60μmol m−2s−1. Every
2–3 weeks, the cultures were harvested and subcultured into fresh media. At the beginning of each of the experi-
ments, a growing culture of female M. pyrifera was filtered through a 160- μmesh Nitex screen. The filtered plant
tufts were rinsed several times with sterile artificial seawater. Portions of the washed tufts were placed in a sterile,
Dounce-type, all-glass hand homogenizer with 15 ml of cold, artificial seawater. The suspension was fragmented and
filtered through a 95- μscreen onto a 43- μNitex screen. The residue was rinsed and resuspended in artificial seawa-
ter and adjusted to a concentration of about 10,000 fragments/ml using a hemocytometer. The plant fragments con-sisted of only three to five cells each. About 30 ml of the plant fragment suspension were poured over a precleaned
10 cm ×10 cm ×15 mm deep, square plastic Petri dish containing nine plastic cover slips (22 mm). All plastic ware
were cleaned by soaking for at least 24 hr in 6 N HCl, followed by several rinses in sterile artificial seawater. Theplant fragments in suspension were allowed to settle on the plastic cover slips under cool white fluorescent lighting
(40–60μmol m
−2s−1, 16:8 hr (L:D)) at 15/C14C for 48 hr. After the fragments had settled and adhered to the cover slips,
they were removed with sterile, plastic forceps and rinsed with sterile artificial seawater to remove unattachedplants. Each cover slip was then placed face up in a sterile 15 ×60-mm round plastic Petri dish containing 12 ml of
enriched seawater or ESAW, with or without the addition of varying amounts of Fe-EDTA. The experimental dishes
with cover slips were incubated under the same conditions as above but were placed on a moving platform, whichoscillated at 32 cycles per minute. The growth and egg production of plant fragments were measured by examiningthe cover slips in the experimental dishes using a Unitron inverted phase-contrast microscope. Egg production was
measured by counting the proportion of plant fragments with extruded eggs. Gametophyte growth was measured by
counting the increase in the number of cells per plant fragment over the experimental time period. For growth mea-surements, all plant fragments were taken initially from the same batch of Macrocystis (Mi-T-19) and averaged 3.65
(SD = 2.0, N= 100) cells/plant fragment.
2.2 |Optimization of Macrocystis pyrifera sporophyte growth on an ocean farm
To examine the effect of depth and timing on the growth of Macrocystis pyrifera , several outplantings were set out in
Whiting Harbor, Sitka, AK (57.051697/C14N, 135.373653/C14W) in 1988 –1990. Detailed methods for this study have been
published previously (Stekoll & Else, 1990). The study reported here lasted 2 years longer than that of Stekoll andElse (1990). The cool, dried sporophylls collected from a natural bed in Whiting Harbor were immersed in seawater attemperatures of 10 –13
/C14C and placed near an artificial light source at 100 μmoles m−2s−1. The resulting spore solution
was filtered through fine nylon mesh (30 μin diameter) to remove mucus. The spore density was determined by use of a
hemocytometer and was diluted to a concentration of about 5,000 –10,000 spores/ml. The solution was then poured
over a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) frame wrapped with previously boiled Kuremona string. Each PVC frame held about
20–30 m of Kuremona . The wrapped PVC frame was maintained in the spore solution in the dark at about 10 –13/C14Cf o r
24 hr. About 5 L of enriched sterile seawater were added to transparent containers holding the PVC frames. The enrich-ment solution was designated as PESI and was modified from that of Provasoli (1968). Modifications included the omis-
sion of all vitamins and the addition of iodine (see above). The seeded string was incubated for 6 weeks at 10 –13
/C14C,
under 70 –80μmol m−2s−1, with a photoperiod of 16:8 hr (L:D). Media changes were performed every 7 –9d a y s .
Outplants were deployed in Whiting Harbor on vertical lines and one longline. The 50-m longline was deployed
only once in February 1989 to simulate normal farming practices. It was set at 3 m below mean of the lower lowSTEKOLL ET AL. 1033
waters (MLLW). Seeded strings 4 –6 cm in length were inserted into the weave of the longline at 1-m intervals. For
timing of outplants, each vertical line structure was anchored with a concrete block and suspended with a submerged
float. To place kelp plants upon the vertical structures, 4 –6-cm sections of seeded Kuremona string were inserted
into the 1 cm-diameter braid of a 50-cm length of rope cable tied into a ring and attached just above the float at 3 m
below MLLW. Thirty of these rings were deployed each month. Vertical lines were randomly placed on a grid layout
set on the ocean floor. For the depth studies, we used dropper lines with seeded Kuremona strings attached at 0.5-m
intervals from 0.5 to 9.5 m below MLLW. For all of the outplantings, growth was followed by measuring the length
of the plants underwater. Initially, the outplanted sporelings were about 0.3 –0.5 cm long. Final biomass yield (kg/m)
of the Macrocystis plants was not assessed because the goal of this project was to grow large bladed plants for the
herring spawn-on-kelp fishery that was occurring at the time in Prince William Sound.
2.3 |Fertilizing Macrocystis sporophytes on an ocean farm
Results of the outplantings of Macrocystis throughout the year showed that most outplants did not successfully over-
winter. An experiment was devised to determine if nutrient limitation in late summer was a possible cause. A long-line, seeded with sporelings obtained from sporophylls gathered from plants in Whiting Harbor, was set at 3 m
below MLLW with healthy plants of about 225 –270 cm frond lengths. For this trial, about 200 g of a slow-release
solid fertilizer (Osmocote N-P-K, 19-6-12, the Scott's Company) was placed in nylon sacks tied to one half of thelongline and placed between plant sections. The other half of the longline served as an unfertilized control. Plant
numbers and frond lengths were monitored over the fall and winter.
2.4 |Optimal time of outplanting Saccharina latissima seed on an ocean farm
For the experiments involving Saccharina latissima , spores were obtained from parent plants collected nearshore near
Juneau, AK. Spores were released from cleaned, dried, fertile sorus sections by immersion in sterile seawater at 12/C14C
as described previously (Redmond, Green, Yarish, Kim, & Neefus, 2014; Stekoll & Else, 1990). All solutions were
made using reagent-grade chemicals dissolved in freshly made Q water (Milli-Q water system).
To examine the optimal outplanting month of Saccharina latissima , seeded Kuremona strings of Saccharina were
wound around rope longlines 15 m in length. Outplants were placed on a monthly basis from October 2015 to March
2016 and from October to December 2016. Lines were set at 2 m below the surface parallel to the shore on thenorthwest coast of Coghlan Island (58.356600
/C14N, 134.705363/C14W) near Juneau, AK. Approximately every 2 weeks,
growth was assessed by measuring the longest frond/blade at every meter along the lines, starting at a random point
near one end of the line. Plants were also assessed for condition by noting fouling or bleaching. A HOBO®tempera-
ture and light logger was placed at 2 m below the surface. Oceanographic samples for light irradiance, temperature,and salinity were taken from the surface to 10 m deep. Water samples for NOx (nitrate + nitrite) and phosphate were
collected with a Niskin-type bottle at depths of 0, 2, and 5 m. Water samples were kept on ice until filtered through
0.22- μfilters and were frozen for later analysis. Phosphate was assessed by the Determination of phosphate proce-
dure in Parsons, Maita, and Lalli (1984). Total NOx was assessed either by the cadmium reduction procedure (Parsons
et al., 1984) or by using a commercial nitrate reductase assay (Nitrate Reductase [AtNaR], NECi Superior Enzymes).
2.5 |Optimal depth of outplanting Saccharina latissima seed on an ocean farm
To assess the optimal depth for outplanting Saccharina latissima , vertical dropper lines were assembled with a length
of line anchored to the bottom and suspended with a surface buoy. Seeded strings of Saccharina were attached to1034 STEKOLL ET AL.
the vertical line every 0.5 m from the surface to a depth of 6 m. A weight was attached to the line below the 6-m
mark to keep the line vertical in the water column. The dropper lines were placed along the shore at the Coghlan
Island site. Dropper lines were outplanted each month from September 2016 to April 2017. Periodic measurementsof the plant growth were made by measuring the length of the three longest plants at each depth.
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Hatchery optimization: Iron and oogenesis in Macrocystis pyrifera gametophytes
A test comparison of female Macrocystis pyrifera gametophytes grown in enriched seawater and in EASW showed no
differences in growth rates or gross morphology. All experiments described in this section were performed usingEASW as the growth medium. Fe-EDTA added to the growth medium had definite effects on the rate at which thefemale Macrocystis gametophyte strain became fertile. The female plant fragments averaged about 3.2 cells per frag-
ment at the beginning of the experiments. No fragments were found to be fertile for at least 4 days after the addi-
tion of Fe-EDTA to the growth media. After the fourth day, there was an approximately linear increase in thepercentage of plant fragments that extruded eggs (Figure 1). The rate at which the fragments became fertile was
much faster in the treatment receiving Fe-EDTA at 9 μM than in the other two treatments (0 and 35 μM). Treat-
ments receiving either no added Fe-EDTA or 35 μM of Fe-EDTA showed increases in fertility in the order of 3 –4%
per day after Day 4, whereas the 9- μM treatment had increases of better than 16% per day in fertile plant fragments.
Statistical analysis of the slopes of the regression lines indicates no differences between the 0- and 35- μM treat-
ments, but the slopes of both treatments are significantly lower than the slope of the 9- μM treatment
(Z> 11, p<< .001).
The stimulation –inhibition of the formation of fertile plant fragments by Fe-EDTA was investigated further by
measuring the proportion of plant fragments that were fertile after 7 days of exposure to varying concentrations of
Fe-EDTA. It is clear from the data presented (Figure 2) that relatively low concentrations of added Fe-EDTA

stimulated egg production but that higher levels inhibited egg production. An iron-binding model based on an
enzyme kinetic model of substrate inhibition was the best fit for the data:
Nf
Np=F/C1Fe½/C138
Ks+F e½/C138+F e½/C1382=K1
where Nfis the number of plants in the fertile state, and Npis the number of plants in the prefertile state or the num-
ber of plants at the beginning of the experiment. The quantity Nf/Npis the proportion of fertile plants at any one
time. Fis related to the maximum proportion of plants that could be fertile. Ksis a combined constant. KIis the equi-
librium constant for iron inhibition.
Growth rates of the plant fragments were similar in all of the treatments (data not shown). Combining all of the
data from all treatments gave a linear growth model for the increase in cell number per plant fragment of 0.68 cells/
day. At the end of the 9 days, the average plant fragment had increased its size by about threefold to 9.4 cells.
3.2 |Optimization of Macrocystis pyrifera sporophyte growth on an ocean farm
Juvenile cultured Macrocystis pyrifera plants were outplanted approximately every month from November 1988 to
March 1990 adjacent to a natural bed located near Sitka, Alaska. There was no or very little growth on the longlines
outplanted in November, December, and January. Growth on the longline outplanted in February reached a lengthof over 2 m by the middle of September but declined over the winter to a point where all plants were lost by the fol-
lowing March (Figure 3).
For the vertical lines, growth of outplants was found to be dependent on both the depth and the time of out-
planting. Most outplants except a February outplant grew until the late summer, and then, growth slowed or
stopped. The best growth occurred between February and August (Figures 4 and 5). Some of the February 1989FIGURE 2 Effect of 7 days of exposure to varying concentrations of Fe-EDTA on the proportion of Macrocystis
pyrifera gametophyte fragments forming eggs. The solid line represents the model fitted to the data. The lines were
fitted to the data points using nonlinear least-square analysis. Each data point represents counts on all viable plantson a cover slip. Actual numbers of plants vary from 94 to 153 plant fragments per point. The amount of iron found inthe usual formulation of Provasoli's enrichment is 9 μM. A concentration of 35 μM was the amount found to be
optimal in the inducement of Laminarian gametophytes (Motomura & Sakai, 1984)1036 STEKOLL ET AL.
outplants at 3 m beneath MLLW reached sizes of approximately 3 m and 5-kg wet weight by August 1989, but only
two of these plants initiated new growth after the subsequent winter. The maximum growth rate of 3.8% per day
achieved by this outplanting in the first 2 months of their growth was less than the maximum of 5 –7% per day
achieved by the April to July outplants (Figure 5). However, the latter outplantings were unable to attain nearly the
size of the earliest outplants (Figure 4). Except for the February outplant, growth dropped rapidly for all outplantings
after August or September (Figure 4). As with the plants on the longline, mortality was very high during the winter.Significant growth did not occur again until April 1990. This growth persisted until October 1990 for most plantswhen plants exhibited a decline through the winter, similar to that of 1989.
The optimum depth for initial growth occurred near the surface, especially when outplanted in April and March.
As the plants grew later in the year, growth was better at deeper depths (Figure 6).
3.3 |Fertilizing Macrocystis sporophytes on an ocean farm
Fertilization experiments conducted in the late summer of 1990 suggested that the application of fertilizer to juve-
nile plants during this season promoted growth and survival (Figure 7). All of the unfertilized plants disappeared bythe end of winter. In contrast, 40% of the fertilized plants survived over the winter, and those that did showed
increased growth of nearly 300%.
3.4 |Optimal time of outplanting Saccharina latissima seed on an ocean farm
Growth of Saccharina was exponential during the first months (Figure 8). Growth rates of 3 –5%/d were attained.
Even so, the final “harvestable ”length varied with the outplant month (Figure 9). The final length of the plants was
longest with outplants in October –November (Figure 9). Unlike Macrocystis in Sitka, Saccharina in Juneau grew well
through the winter when outplanted in the fall or the winter. All outplants showed slowed growth in May –June, with
blades becoming fouled with organisms such as bryozoans and diatoms.
Fresh weight yields of Saccharina latissima were determined in late April 2016 and varied with the time of out-
plant. The maximum biomass of 10.4 kg/m occurred with the November 2015 outplant. The lowest yield was1.8 kg/m from the outplanting in January 2016. The mean of the yields from four monthly outplantings of October
2015 to January 2016 was 4.74 ± 1.95 kg/m.FIGURE 3 Growth (±95% CI) of

Water temperatures at the 2-m depth ranged from 4/C14C in the late winter to 15/C14C in late summer (data not

September (data not shown).FIGURE 4 Average growth (±95% CI)

3.5 |Optimal depth of outplanting Saccharina latissima seed on an ocean farm
In most cases, the best growth on the dropper lines was initially near the surface (Figure 11), but by the end of the
growing season, the best depth for outplanting seeded strings of Saccharina latissima was 2–3 m below the surfaceFIGURE 5 Initial growth rates of
Macrocystis pyrifera as a function of the

(Figure 12). The dropper lines also reinforced the timing of outplants. Outplant months in the fall yielded the longest
plants at the end of the growing season. Dropper lines outplanted in late spring and summer showed little or no
growth at depths from near the surface to 6 m below.FIGURE 7 Effect of fertilization on

4|DISCUSSION
4.1 |Hatchery optimization: Iron and oogenesis in Macrocystis pyrifera gametophytes
Added chelated iron, the most common form of iron used to culture marine algae, had a stimulatory effect on egg
production in Macrocystis pyrifera gametophytes. Plants exposed to higher levels of iron were inhibited in their ability
to produce eggs but were still able to grow by means of cell division. These results replicate the published work of
others on kelp gametophytes and added iron (Kuwabara & North, 1980; Lewis, Green, & Afzal, 2013; Motomura &
Sakai, 1981, 1984; Suzuki, Kuma, & Matsunaga, 1994). Our model for the iron effect assumes saturation uptakekinetics, leading to a pattern indicative of substrate inhibition (Cornish-Bowden, 1979). The model predicts that the
optimal iron concentration for egg production after 7 days' exposure to Fe-EDTA is about 1.3 μM. In addition theFIGURE 10 NOx (nitrate + nitrite) concentrations at Coghlan Is, Juneau, AK measured at 0, 2, and 5 m below the
surface. The drop in NOx begins to occur in mid-April, coinciding with the spring phytoplankton bloom
FIGURE 11 Saccharina latissima

model predicts that the iron concentration in the treatment with no added iron is 0.027 μM. These numbers are simi-
lar to those reported for Laminaria japonica in Suzuki et al. (1994) but are about 3.7 times higher than those reported
forMacrocystis using Aquil as the growth medium (Kuwabara & North, 1980). Although Kuwabara (1980) did not
investigate inhibitory levels, Motomura and Sakai (1984) found that Fe-EDTA at about 88 μM (5.0 mg/L) inhibited
egg formation by about 20%. Similar levels of Fe-EDTA in the present study caused almost complete inhibition ofegg formation.
Lüning (1980) proposed that two developmental pathways are available for germinating spores in Laminaria
(Saccharina ) species. In this scheme, the total quanta of blue light is the trigger that controls gametogenesis or vegetative
development. The results presented here and by others (L ewis et al., 2013; Motomura & Sakai, 1981, 1984; Suzuki
et al., 1994) modify this scheme by incorporating iron concentration into the control of development. A gametophyte will
develop gametes only if sufficient blue light and the correct co ncentration of iron are available . If the light quanta received
are below a certain threshold, or if the iron concentration is too low or too high, the spores will develop into vegetative,
multicellular gametophytes. When environmental conditions are favorable at a later time, gametogenesis will be triggered.
These results have practical implications for kelp mariculture operations. If natural spore release occurs too early
relative to the optimal time of outplanting, it may be necessary to delay gametogenesis so that sporelings will beready at the desired time. Another reason to delay gametogenesis or to keep gametophytes for long periods of time
is an alternative way to produce young juvenile kelp blades. Gametophyte clones whose genes promote faster
growth, larger plants, or better-quality plants for the commercial markets can be selected. The ability to store theseclones will not only allow for breeding of select blades but will also ensure a continuous supply of seed and will pro-vide for a seed stock free of contamination (Redmond et al., 2014). When one is ready to produce the desired sporo-
phytes, selected male and female gametophytes can be combined in media with iron or under white light conditions
to induce gametogenesis. These results have been replicated in the lab for other kelp species, including Nereocystis
luetkeana ,Alaria marginata , and Agarum clathratum Dumortier. Removing iron from the gametophyte culture media is
an easy and cost-effective method for long-term storage of kelp gametophytes.
4.2 |Optimization of Macrocystis pyrifera sporophyte growth on an ocean farm
Timing of outplanting of kelp species is an important consideration for any commercial mariculture enterprise. The
end goal is usually the production of optimal biomass per unit line length and/or optimal quality for the intendedFIGURE 12 Saccharina latissima

uses. Because Macrocystis in the Sitka, AK area is fertile almost every month of the year, farmers have the ability to
outplant at any time. The results from our Sitka outplantings would indicate that the best time for outplanting
Macrocystis in this area would be when the water temperature is 4 –5/C14C in February, which —although it will not have
the fastest initial growth rate —will achieve the longest length by the end of the first growing season in late summer,
giving the plants a better chance to survive through the winter.
There are many factors that can determine the growth of Macrocystis in an aquaculture setting. Variability in site
location, latitude, oceanographic parameters, presence/absence of herbivory, and season are some of the consider-
ations necessary for optimal timing and depth of outplants. This has been found for Macrocystis aquaculture attempts
in Chile (Camus, Infante, & Buschmann, 2018), China (Liu et al., 1984), and the United States (Kim et al., 2019).
4.3 |Fertilizing Macrocystis sporophytes on an ocean farm
The light compensation point for Macrocystis pyrifera in California has been reported to be between 0.4 and
0.7 mol m−2d−1(Dean & Jacobsen, 1984). In Sitka, AK, during November through January, there are, on average, about
7 hr of daylight each day. An irradiance of 0.7 mol m−2d−1would be, on average, about 28 μmol m−2s−1. At a depth of
2 m, over 90% of the light is absorbed by the water column in Sitka in the winter (data not shown). Although we did
not measure irradiance on a continual basis, our data show that light levels were often below 30 μmol m−2s−1mea-
sured at 2 –5 m below the surface at mid-day during the winter. We conclude that if the light compensation point for
Macrocystis pyrifera in Sitka is similar to that in California, then plants in Sitka may be light limited during the shortest
days in the winter. During these times, the plants would need to rely on stored reserves to stay alive. If the low nutri-
ents combined with high water temperatures and lower salinity in the late summer are too stressful, the plants will nothave enough reserves to survive the dark winter. This would explain why adding fertilizer to the plants in August mightincrease the viability of the fronds enough to get through until light levels increase later in the winter.
4.4 |Optimal time of outplanting Saccharina latissima seed on an ocean farm
Unlike the outplanting results for Macrocystis pyrifera , outplants of Saccharina latissima near Juneau had measurable
growth when placed in the water in the fall, and they grew well through the winter, reaching maximal length in
May/June. However, growth stopped at that point, and the blades became fouled with epiphytes such as diatoms
and bryozoans. We had no success in getting outplants to last over the summer. This was a bit different than thegrowth of Macrocystis , whose growth peaked in mid-summer. Saccharina latissima also did well when outplanted in
the winter and through to March. Initial growth was similar to other outplant times, but the final length was shorter
because, no matter when the plants were set out, growth ceased at about the same time. The plants slowed orceased growing about a month or so after the spring bloom.
The average biomass yield reported here of about 5 kg/m is somewhat low when compared to other studies.
The published fresh weight yields of Saccharina latissima from mariculture operations have ranged from 0.5 kg/m
(Bruhn et al., 2016) to over 24 kg/m (Kim et al., 2019), with about 10 –15 kg/m being a rough average. Yields from
farms in the Faroe Islands varied from 5.2 ± 0.4 kg/m to 9.9 ± 1.5 kg/m depending on the wave exposure of the sites
(Mols-Mortensen, Ortind, Jacobsen, & Holdt, 2017). Yields from farms in Spain situated at exposed and sheltered
sites were 16 and 12 kg/m, respectively (Peteiro & Freire, 2013). High yields of 24 kg/m were reported forS. latissima after 6 months (December to May) of growth in Long Island Sound and New York estuaries (Kim
et al., 2019).
Work with Laminaria longicruris (Saccharina longicruris) found that the nitrogen pool in the blades was depleted
following the disappearance of the external NOx with a lag period of up to 2 months (Chapman & Craigie, 1977;
Egan & Yarish, 1990). Saccharina latissima (asLaminaria saccharina) under conditions of low external nitrogen reliedSTEKOLL ET AL. 1043
on internal reserves of NO 3and organic compounds, but the nitrogen reserves were depleted rapidly with reduced
growth after 3 months (Korb & Gerard, 2000). In the northern section of southeastern Alaska, the spring bloom of
phytoplankton occurs around the middle of April concomitant with a rapid drop in NOx. Thus, we would expect thatS. latissima would deplete its internal reserves of nitrogen and slow or cease growth in May –June, depending on the
state of its nitrogen reserves. The conclusion from a mariculture standpoint is to outplant S. latissima in the fall to
coincide with the increase in nutrients in the water that usually occurs in late October to early November. Earlieroutplantings can be successful, but we have encountered more opportunistic recruits of unwanted kelps plus mas-
sive settlements of invertebrates with these early outplantings. We recommend harvest in May in order to have the
largest plants with the best quality, that is, fewest epiphytes and/or grazing by snails.
4.5 |Optimal depth of outplanting Saccharina latissima seed on an ocean farm
Most of the experiments with the dropper lines showed that depths of outplants work best at 2 –3 m below the sur-
face, and that is the suggestion we make for the mariculture of Saccharina latissima in the area of the Gulf of Alaska.
That is the range that current farmers in Alaska have used. Others have recommended outplanting depths of 1 –2m
(Flavin, Flavin, & Flahive, 2013; Kim, Kraemer, & Yarish, 2015; Redmond et al., 2014), but good growth can occur as
deep as 8 m depending on the water quality and season (Handa et al., 2013). At our site, initial growth was the best
near the surface (0.5 m), but later, the plants at depths of 2 –3 m outgrew the near-surface plants. A strategy to obtain
bigger plants would be to outplant near the surface and drop the plants to 2 –3 m in February as daylight increases. In
our experience, Saccharina latissima in Alaska does not develop a hollow stipe and, therefore, remains negatively
buoyant throughout the growing season. In fact, to keep the lines at the desired depth requires maintaining the ten-sion on the longlines or using buoys attached to the longlines. Because oceanic conditions vary from site to site, it isrecommended that dropper lines be deployed to determine the optimal timing and depth for outplanting Saccharina
latissima and other kelp species.
4.6 |Recent research in Alaska
In the late 1970s, as a result of the so-called energy crises, there was a concerted effort to grow Macrocystis in large-
scale offshore structures in southern California (e.g., Flowers and Bird 1984). The idea was to produce biogas or other
energy from a renewable resource. For various reasons, this endeavor ended with no commercial production (Kimet al., 2019). Recently, there has been renewed interest in generating energy from offshore kelp farms. The United
States Department of Energy has a program, Macroalgae Research Inspiring Novel Energy Resources (MARINER),
under their ARPA-E division (https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=arpa-e-programs/mariner). The University of Alaskaunder MARINER is currently conducting research with the title “Scalable Coastal and Offshore Macroalgal Farming ”
(https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=slick-sheet-project/scalable-coastal-and-offshore-macroalgal-farming), looking at the
potential for large-scale, offshore farming of Saccharina latissima for generating biomass for energy production. The
goal is to design and test systems that will produce biomass at a cost that would be competitive with fossil fuels. Thisproject, which includes the University of Connecticut, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the Marine Biological
Laboratory, the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation, Goudey & Associates, GreenWave, and Blue Evolution,
deployed its first farm array in Kodiak, AK in the fall of 2019 with harvest in the following June (2020).
5|CONCLUSIONS
Withholding iron from the culture medium has been a successful method to maintain kelp gametophytes from sev-
eral species for several years without them becoming fertile. In most cases, refragmenting the gametophytes and1044 STEKOLL ET AL.
using a normal culture medium restores gamete formation, allowing farmers to both time outplants to their needs
and to have a route for trait selection.
Predicting the success of kelp mariculture in Alaska or elsewhere is problematical because of the natural variabil-
ity of parameters in the ocean, by location, by season, by year, etc. Of the greatest importance are the availability of
nutrients, especially nitrogen, and the range of water temperatures. Site selection and farm deployment should be
augmented by using dropper lines to assess seasonality and optimal depths. Critical oceanographic measurementswill aid in the consideration of site suitability. Moving kelp farming to offshore locations will present a host of new
issues for kelp mariculture. Studies such as those funded by ARPA-E will help to determine the success of such
operations.
