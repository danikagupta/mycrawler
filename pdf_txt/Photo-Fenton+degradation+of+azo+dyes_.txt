 Abstract  
Synthetic dyes are widely used in many industries, including textile production, plastic 
manufacturing, and food processing. Currently, approximately 30000 – 150000 tons of dyes 
are being discharged into waterways, posing a threat to human health as well as the aquatic 
environment. Most of these dyes can persist in aquatic systems for a long p eriod due to their 
resistance to bacterial and chemical attacks. One way to deal with this issue appears to be the 
photo -Fenton oxidation process, which is efficient in catalyzing the decomposition of 
recalcitrant organic dyes in water.  
Recently, perovskit e oxides with the general formula ABO 3 (A = alkaline earth or rare earth 
element; B = transition metal) have been recognized as an efficient form of heterogeneous 
catalysts to participate in the photo -Fenton process for the degradation of organic dyes. LaF eO3 
is one of the widely studied perovskite oxides due to its non -toxicity, relative stability , and 
favorable optical property. The development of a heterogeneous photo -Fenton process, 
especially using visible light, is a sensible approach from the practic al application point of 
view, both in terms of cost and energy effectiveness, and was , therefore , the focus of this study.  
LaFeO 3-based catalysts were developed and tested for their efficiency to degrade organic dyes, 
such as Rhodamine B (RhB), Methyl Ora nge (MO), and Methylene Blue (MB), via visible -
light photo -Fenton reaction. The morphological, structural and chemical properties of the 
catalysts were studied in detail. Their catalytic activity, stability , and reusability in the photo -
Fenton degradation of dyes were assessed, followed by the optimization of operation conditions 
(e.g., H2O2 concentration, catalyst dosage , and initial solution pH) targeting at maximum dye 
removal. Based on the observations, possible reaction mechanisms for the LaFeO 3-based 
catalysts that improved photo -Fenton degradation efficiency were proposed. A preliminary 
techno -economic assessment for the practical application of the process was also performed.

 Chapter 1. Introduction  
1.1. Background information  
Organic dyes from textile production and other industrial processes are one of the main groups 
of pollutants in wastewater (Touati, Hammedi et  al. 2016) . Approximately 2 – 15% of dyes 
used in these industries are directly released into the environment (Ràfols and Barceló 1997, 
Houas, Lachheb et al. 2001) . The continuous discharge of untreated wastewater in to natural 
environment has resulted in some serious problems across many countries (Han, Kambala et 
al. 2009) . Such organic dyes can lead to the destruction of aquatic communities (Papić, 
Koprivanac et al. 2004)  as well as acute poisoning to animals and human beings (Padhi 2012) . 
Therefore, the removal of organic dyes from wastewater by using an appropriate treatment 
method is one of the essential issues to be solved.  
The conventional technologies used in the removal of dyes from wastewater include adsorption 
(Nandi, Goswami et al. 2009) , membrane -filtration treatment (Ciardelli, Corsi et al. 2001) , 
microbial (Banat, Nigam et al. 1996)  or biological processes (Paprowicz and Słodczyk 1988) . 
All of them are effective to a certain degree with limitations. For example, biodegradation 
treatment is inca pable of decomposing some dyes such as azo dyes due to their high chemical 
stability (Beyene 2014) ; whilst the main disadvantages of membrane -filtration process are 
membrane fouling, high cost, and ineffectiveness in treating the wastewater of very low 
concentrations of dyes (Pearce, Lloyd et al. 2003, Samsudin, Hamid et al. 2015) . Consequently, 
a promising technology base d on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) has attracted 
considerable attention, which can quickly and non -selectively oxidize a wide range of organic 
dyes (Hachem, Bocquillon et al. 2001, Qi, Zhuang et al. 2002) .  
One of the efficient AOPs is Fenton process, basically divided into the homogeneous and 
heterogeneous systems based on the physical state of the catalyst s. Compared to the 
homogeneous one, the heterogeneous Fenton process can oxidize a variety of organic pollutants 
in a wide pH range rapidly and non -selectively with the generation of little iron sludge. Other 
advantages  include the complete mineralization of organic compounds and easy operation at 
mild condition (Ramirez, Maldonado -Hódar et al. 2007, Papić, Vujević et al. 2009, Rodriguez, 
Ovejero et al. 2009) . The heterogeneous Fenton process involves the reaction between Fe -
based solid catalyst and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which 
are oxidants capable of degrading various organic contaminants in wastewater (Legrini, Chapter 1                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 Oliveros et al. 1993, Xu, Wang et al. 2011) . In the presence of either  ultraviolet (UV) 
irradiation, visible light or both these light sources, a photo -Fenton reaction occurs, which has 
a higher degradation rate than the Fenton process (Chacón, Leal et al. 2006) . As compared with 
the relatively high cost and energy consumption when utilizing a light source to generate UV 
light, the adoption of visible light provides an economical approach as using the solar light 
resource, which is free of cost and widely available in the world.  
Among the semiconductors which are used in the photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of dyes, 
perovskite -type catalytic materials, ABO 3 (A = rare earth elements and B = transition metal 
elements), have been extensively studied because of their high stability and photocatalytic 
performance (Soltani and Lee 2016, Palas, Ersöz et al. 2017, Soltani and L ee 2017) . The 
literature suggests that LaFeO 3 (LFO), as a member of the group of perovskite materials, could 
be a promising heterogeneous catalyst in the photo -Fenton  degradation of pollutants (Li, Wang 
et al. 201 4, Nie, Zhang et al. 2015) . However, perovskites, which were prepared by 
conventional methods, e.g. , sol-gel method, solution combustion, co -precipitation, etc., are 
often seen with low specific surface area and large particle size, which result in low contact 
efficiency and activity with organics and in turn limits their applications (Su, Jing et al. 2010, 
Margellou, Pa padas et al. 2016) . Previous studies have found that the catalytic activity of LFO 
strongly replies on the inherent properties of materials, including particle crystallinity, size, 
pore structure and morphology, etc.; which are greatly affected by the synthetic methods. 
However, only limited progress has been made in the exploration of effective synthetic method 
to produce high -performance LFO photocatalysts for photo -Fenton degradation of organic dyes 
under visible light irradiation. Therefore, this res earch aims to develop novel strategies to 
fabricate LFO -based photocatalysts with high catalytic activity and good recyclability.  
1.2. Contributions  
The proposed study may contribute to the development of treatment options that could enable 
an effective re duction of organic dye pollutants from wastewater. Findings from the proposed 
study could result in the following major outcomes:  
● Fabrication of LFO -based catalysts with superior photo -Fenton catalytic activity 
under solar light illumination and good recyclability;  
● Development of synthetic methods to produce LFO -based catalysts, which are 
relatively easy, low -cost and environmentally friendly;  Chapter 1                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 ● Development of fundamental understanding on the relationship between photo -
Fenton reaction by using newly dev eloped LFO -based catalysts and their structural 
and chemical properties;  
● Optimization on the use of LFO -based catalysts for effective photo -Fenton catalytic 
degradation of organic dyes in wastewater.  
The benefits of success in this endeavour would go beyo nd human and environmental 
protection and lead to great opportunities for economic prosperity.  
1.3. Objectives  
The broad aim of this research is to develop LFO -based perovskites as photocatalysts for the 
effective removal of organic dyes via heterogeneous visible -light photo -Fenton degradation. 
Synthetic methods, in conjunction with the  use of templates, will be investigated. In addition, 
the doping with other metals in the Fe -site of LFO will be adopted to further improve catalytic 
performance. A series of  factors affecting photocatalytic performance and reusability of our 
newly developed catalysts will be studied and then optimized in terms of technical (e.g., 
operational condition and energy consumption), economic (e.g., availability and cost) and 
environ mental requirements.  
To achieve the broad aim, five main objectives are listed:  
1. To synthesize LFO -based photocatalysts via different methods and utilize them in 
the photo -Fenton degradation of dyes, i.e., Rhodamine B (Rhb) , methylene blue 
(MB) and methyl o range  (MO) , under visible light illumination;  
2. To establish the chemical compositions of LFO by doping with other metal, such 
as partial substitution of copper (Cu) into Fe -site. 
3. To study the effects of parameters, including synthetic temperature, precursor 
composition, and calcination condition, on the synthesis of LFO -based catalysts ; 
4. To study the photocatalytic activity of materials in degrading dyes under visible 
light by varying different factors, such as catalyst dosage, H 2O2 concentration, 
initial solution pH, initial dye concentration, co -existing anions, as well as 
reusability and stability;  Chapter 1                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 5. To optimize the synthesis of LFO -based catalysts between the preparation 
condi tions and the photo -Fenton catalytic performances.  
1.4. Thesis structure  
● Chapter 1 presents background information on the photo -Fenton degradation of organic 
dyes using LaFeO 3 (LFO) -based material s as the heterogeneous catalysts. The gaps in 
the recent res earch and the objectives of this study have been discussed in this chapter  
as well . 
● Chapter 2 reviews the relevant literatures that have been published in recent years and 
emphasizes the importance of objectives of this research study in contributing novel  
scholarly knowledge in the field of organic dyes degradation via the photo -Fenton 
process.  
● Chapter 3 investigates the photo -Fenton catalytic activity for dye degradation between 
LFO and other rare earth orthoferrites such as PrFeO 3 and GdFeO 3. A comparative 
assessment, in terms of photo -Fenton catalytic efficiency, between these orthoferrites 
was investigated in detail. LFO appears to be the best orthoferrite for dye degradation 
via photo -Fenton process ; therefore,  it was chosen  as the parent catalyst material  for 
the following structural and morphological modifications targeting at enhanced 
catalytic activity . 
● Chapter 4 describes the effect of the selection of iron precursor, synthetic solution pH 
and calcination temperature on the morpholog ical, structur al and optical properties of 
LFO prepared using the hydrothermal method. However, LFO showed a low photo -
Fenton catalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO), which has high 
chemical stability and low photosensitized property. Th erefore, it is necessary to 
develop a new LFO -based catalyst with enhanced photo -Fenton catalytic activity. The 
use of copper (Cu) as a dopant and its incorporation into the perovskite lattice have 
been proven to improve the catalytic activity of parent pe rovskites. In the next chapter 
“Chapter 5 . Enhancement of photo -Fenton catalytic activity of LaFeO 3 by partial 
substitution of Cu into Fe site: catalyst synthesis, material properties and reaction 
mechanism”, we developed a new Cu -doped LFO heterogeneous photocatalyst for the 
visible -light-Fenton degradation of cationic and anionic dyes and investigated the effect 
of operational conditions on MO degradation.   Chapter 1                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 ● Chapter 5 deals with the study of partial substitution of Cu into LFO material by a facile 
hydrot hermal reaction and its photo -Fenton catalytic performance under visible light 
toward cation and anion dyes degradation. The possible catalytic mechanism s of Cu -
doped LFO were developed. However, the Cu -doped LFO photocatalyst showed a low 
specific surface  area, which may limit the contact area between the pollutant and the 
active sites of the catalyst. The development of supported LFO catalyst with porosity 
for high -performance photo -Fenton degradation of dye is of great interest. In the next 
chapter “ Chapter 6 . Characterization and application of LaFeO 3-incorporated 
mesoporous silica for organic dye removal with the synergistic effect of adsorption and 
photo -Fenton catalytic degradation” , we explore the use of silica -supported LFO for 
enhanced photo -Fenton degradation of RhB under visible light thanks to the effective 
dark adsorption and visible light -induced photo -Fenton degradation. The optimization 
of catalytic performance of silica -supported LFO catalyst under various operational 
conditions and the investigation of its feasibility for recycle and reuse  are also included . 
● Chapter 6 describes the fabrication of LFO -incorporated mesoporous silica by the 
method of impregnation and subsequent calcination. The effect of operational 
parameters on the photo -Fenton degradation of RhB was investigated in detail. More 
research questions arising from the findings of this chapter, including: (i) Is there a 
more cost -effective material that can be the support for LFO? (ii) Does the new 
supported LFO catalyst work as an efficient heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like catalyst 
for dye degradation?  These questions are discussed in the next chapter “ Chapter 7 . 
Enhanced removal of organic using LaFeO 3-integrated modified natural zeolites via 
heterogeneous visible light photo-Fenton degradation”  
● Chapter 7 describes the doping  of LFO into acid -modified natural zeolite s via a simple 
impregnation -calcination method and testing its photo -Fenton -like activity in the 
decolo rization of RhB under visible light. The operational parameters w ere varied to 
achieve highest decolorization efficiency. It is well known that photo -Fenton process 
could be applied for treating many organic pollutants from different industrial 
wastewaters. Applying the photo -Fenton process in pilot scale fo r dye -containing 
wastewater treatment has been carried out in several countries. In the next chapter 
“Chapter 8 . Techno -economic analysis of photo -Fenton process in a wastewater 
treatment plant”, we conducted preliminary  techno -economic analysis of the 
degradation of organic dyes by using the photo -Fenton process at pilot plant scale. To Chapter 1                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 this aim, several dyes (RhB, MO, MB) were  selected for treatment by using our various 
catalyst systems , such as LFO, Cu -doped LFO, LFO -doped silica and LFO -doped 
modified z eolite.  
● Chapter 8 presents the preliminary techno -economic evaluation of photo -Fenton 
process at pilot scale by using our newly developed catalyst systems. The calculations 
suggest that LFO is considered to be the most effective catalyst for the photo -Fenton 
degradation of dye under visible light irradiation in terms of the cost and removal 
efficiency.  
● Chapter 9 draws the main conclusions derived from this study and prospective for future 
research to further investigate the subject.

2.1. Introduction  
Different types of organic compounds are used in many industries such as paint, textile , and 
cosmetic production and health care. Among these compounds, organic dyes are a large group 
that causes en vironment pollution. Wastewater originating from these industries contains a 
variety of stable organic pollutants with aromatic rings, which are persistent in the environment 
(Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006) . Most of these organic contaminants not only 
pollute water bodies but also cause negative effects on human well -being and the ecosystem 
due to their carcinogenicity, toxicity , and mutagenicity (Díaz -Cruz and Barceló 2008, 
Mohapatra, Brar et al. 2010) . Consequently, wastewater treatment aimed at minimizing the 
levels of these organic compounds has been the subject of extensive research.  
Conventional technologies for the treatment of dye -containing wastewater such as biological 
degradation (Grady Jr, Daigger et al. 2011) , coagulation/adsorption (Papić, Koprivanac et al. 
2004)  and membrane filtration (Rosenberger, Laabs et al. 2006)  are not sufficiently effective 
to achieve stringent requirements for discharg e. As a result, there has  been much research 
focused on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), which show promise as effective process es 
for degradation and mineralization of refractory organic dyes in industrial effluents (Matilainen 
and Sillanpää 2010, Oller, Malato et al. 2011) . AOPs involve the generation of free radicals 
(.OH) via chemical (Al-Kdasi, Idris et al. 2004) , photochemical (Andreozzi, Caprio et al. 1999, 
Lachheb, Puzenat et al. 2002)  and photocatalytic reaction s (Oppenländer 2003) . The 
significantly advantageou s feature  of AOP s is that these radicals are capable in non -selectively 
degrading organic pollutants to form mainly carbon dioxide, water and inorganic salts (Gogate 
and Pandit 2004, Pera -Titus, Garcıa -Molina et al. 2004) . Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 The Fenton process is well known as one of the widely  used AOPs for organic wastewater 
treatment (Wang, Zheng et al. 2016) . The homogeneous Fenton process uses ferrous salt as a 
catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant to produce hydroxyl radicals. Despite several 
advantages such as high performance, non -toxicity, and simplicity (Wang, Zheng et al. 2016) , 
the application of the homogeneous Fenton process is limited due to its narrow working pH 
range and iron hydroxide sludge generation (Arslan -Alaton, Tureli et al. 2009) . On the other 
side, the heterogeneous Fenton process can oxidize a variety of organic pollutants in a wide pH 
range rapidly and non -selec tively and generate little iron sludge. Other advantages include the 
complete mineralization of organic compounds and ease of operation at mild conditions 
(Ramirez, Maldonado -Hódar et al. 2007, Papić, Vujević et al. 2009, Rodriguez, Ovejero et al. 
2009) . In the presence of either ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, visible light or both, a photo -
Fenton  reaction occurs, which has a higher degradation rate of pollutants than the Fenton 
process (Chacón, Leal et al. 2006) . The use of visible  light is more economical than that of UV 
light, as UV light sources have a relatively high cost and energy consumption.   
Recently, perovskite materials having the generic formula of ABO 3 or A 2BO 4,  in which A is 
typically an alkaline -earth or rare -earth element and B is a transition metal, have been found to 
exhibit high visible -light photo -Fenton -like activity for dye degradation (Ju, Chen et al. 2011, 
An, Zhu et al. 2013) . In this review paper, we summarize recent pr ogress in the development 
of perovskite -based photocatalysts for wastewater treatment with an emphasis on the strategies 
for enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency as well as light absorption ability. Following the 
introductory section, section 2 provides  a general review of dyes and the technologies for their 
removal from wastewater. In section 3, the procedures for synthesizing photo -Fenton catalysts 
are reported. Section 4 focus es on the mechanism of the photo -Fenton process for dye 
degradation. Section  5 summarizes the effect of operational parameters on the photo -Fenton 
degradation of dyes. The strategies for improvement of the photocatalytic activity of perovskite 
catalysts are discussed in section 6. Section 7  gives a  conclusion summarising prospecti ve 
future studies of highly active perovskite -based photocatalysts.  
2.2. Fundamentals of dyes and their removal  
2.2.1 Classification of dyes  
Dyes are classified in a variety of ways. For example, they can be classified according to their 
method s of application to the substrate, such as azoic dyes, vat dyes, reactive dyes, direct dyes, 
disperse dyes, and so on (Gregory 1990) . Based on the source s of the materials they are made 
from, dyes can be natural or synthetic (Raval, Sha h et al. 2017) . Dyes may also be classified Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 by the e lectronic origins of their colors, including  donor -acceptor chromogens, cyanine -type 
chromogens, polyene chromogens, and n → π* chromogens  (Raval, Shah et al. 2017) . 
However, the most useful classification method in the context of dye degradation is based on 
the chemical structure of dy es, which is determined by the colo r index (C.I.) (Gregory 1990) . 
In the chemical classification method, dyes consist of two different group s, namely 
chromophores and auxochromes. Chromophores are group s of atoms determining the colo r of 
the dye ; while auxochromes are responsible for the color intensity (Moussavi and Mahmoudi 
2009) . The most important chromophores are azo ( -N=N -), methane ( -CH=), carbonyl ( -C=O), 
nitro ( -NO 2) and quinoid groups. Common auxochromes groups are carboxyl ( -COOH), 
hydroxyl ( -OH), amine (-NH 3), amino ( -NR 2) and sulfonate ( -SO 3H) (Christie 2001, Dos 
Santos, Cervantes et al. 2007) . Table 2.1 summarises representative examples of different types 
of dyes.

 2.2.2 Removal of dyes  
Treatment of dye -containing wastewater is considered to be one of the most difficult tasks  for 
many of industries before discharging effluent into environment  (Srinivasan and Viraraghavan 
2010) . It is characterized by strong color, highly fluctuating pH, a high level of COD (Chemical 
Oxygen Demand) and dissolved solids, and low biodegradability (Vlyssides, Papaioannou et 
al. 2000, Bayramoglu, Kobya et al. 2004) . There is concern that dyes in wastewater are skin 
sensitizers for animals, pose mutagenic ity and toxic ity to humans, and affect gas solubility in 
water and reduce water transparency (Vanhulle, Trovaslet et al. 2007) . Therefore, wastewater  
which contains dyes  must be treated before it is released  into waterways in order to protect 
human health as well as comply with the environmental protection law. Over the past few years, 
many investigations have been conducted to explore effective and efficient treatment s for dye 
removal, including physical, biological and chemical methods. Each method has its advantages 
and limitations when being applied , which are discussed in detail in this section.  
2.2.2.1 Physical method  
2.2.2.1.1 Membrane f iltration  
Filtration , using reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration or microfiltration membranes,  
has been  used as  an accepted process for color removal (Koyuncu 2003, Nataraj, Hosamani et 
al. 2009, Alventosa -deLara, Barredo -Damas et al. 2012, Zinadini, Zinatizadeh et al. 2014, Guo, 
Zhang et al. 2016) . The color removal efficiency of dye -bearing wastewater using membrane 
separation i s mainly dependent on the composition of dye effluent, type of membrane and 
operating conditions (Liu, Lü et al. 2011) . For example, microfiltration membranes achieve 
good color removal  rate for dispersed  (69.6 – 99.1%)  and vat dyes  (80.5 – 89.3%) ; while 
ultrafiltration and nanofiltration can achieve complete removal of colo r for all dyes (Marmagne 
and Coste 1996) . However , some obstacles hindering dye -wastewater treatment using this 
method have seen in the literatures , such as high consumption of energy and high cost of 
membrane. Furthermore, dye molecules frequently clogged the pores of membrane or 
deposited on the membrane surface; this would largely increase the cost for chemical/physical 
cleaning and shorten the lifetime of membrane  (Gupta and Suhas 2009) .  
2.2.2.1.2 Coagulation/ flocculation  
Coagulation/flocculation has been commonly  applied  in water treatment industry , for example 
as a pre-treatment  process  for high-load chemical -pharmaceutical industry wastewater  (Torres, Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
11 
 Jaimes et al. 1997)  (Choi, Shin et al. 2001) . This method is effective for the removal of 
dispers ing and sulf ur dyes , but it  has limited capacity for removing reactive, acid, vat and direct 
dyes (Saratale, Saratale et al. 2011) . In the process of coagulation /flocculation , dyes are not  
decomposed , and thus no harmful and toxic intermediates  produced (Shi, Li et al. 2007) . 
Moreover,  the coagulation/flocculation process has advantages, including simple operation, 
low energy consumption and cost  effective ness (Teh, Budiman et al. 2016) . However, the 
major limitation s of this technique are low decolorization efficiency and generation of a large 
amount of sludge (Vandevivere, Bianchi et al. 1998) .     
2.2.2.1.3 Adsorption  
Adsorption is a process in which a concentration of a particular material (adsorbate) is 
increased at the interface between two phases (Dąbrowski 2 001). Adsorption is an effective 
process for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants from wastewater (Robinson, McMullan et al. 
2001) . It largely depend s on the surface chemistry of adsorbent and the structure and properties 
of dye (Noroozi, Sorial et al. 2007) , which are influenced by several physio -chemical factors, 
including solution pH, operation temperature and contact time (Robinson, McMullan et al. 
2001) .  
The most commonly used adsorbent for the adsorpti ve removal  of acid, reactive, cationic, 
direct and ba sic dyes is activated carbon (Namasivayam and Kavitha 2002, Malik 2003, Başar 
2006, Al -Degs, El -Barghouthi et al. 2008, Tan, Ahmad et al. 2008) . Its removal efficiency 
depends on the type of carbon used and the characteristics of wastewater (Robinson, McMullan 
et al. 2001) . Despite its efficiency in dye adsorption, it was considered to be too expensive for 
general use (Hameed, Ahmad et al. 2007, Srinivasan and Viraraghavan 2010) . Therefore, the 
utilization of low -cost adsorbents has been studied, such as fly ash (Sun, Zhang et al. 2010) , 
wood chips (Nigam, Armour et al. 2000) , peat (Allen, Mckay et al. 2004) , silica gel (Samiey 
and Toosi 2010) , and natural clays (Özcan, Öncü et al. 2006, Veli and Alyüz 2007, Toor and 
Jin 2012) . Although the adsorption treatment may produce high -quality product (Choy, McKay 
et al. 1999, Noroozi, Sorial et al. 2007) , its practical application is limited by the problems , 
such as  adsorbent regeneration and disposal, high operation cost, large sludge production and 
ineffective ness for many dyes (Saratale, Saratale et al. 2011) . Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 2.2.2.2 Biological method  
Biological treatment is  the most common technique for the removal of dye s from wastewater 
(Gupta and Suhas 2009) . It can be divided into three main categories - aerobic (treatment in 
the presence of oxygen), anaerobic (treatment without oxygen) and combined aerobic -
anaerobic treatment.  
2.2.2.2.1 Aerobic treatment  
The use of bacteria (Chang, Chou et al. 2001, Novotný, Svobodová et al. 2011) , fungi 
(Wesenberg, Kyriakides et al. 2003, Gou, Qu et al. 2009) , yeasts (Yang, Yediler et al. 2005, 
Yu and Wen 2005) , acti nomycetes (Zhou and Zimmermann 1993, Mane, Gurav et al. 2008 ), 
algae (El-Sheekh, Gharieb et al. 2009) , and plants (Aubert and Schwitzguebel 2004, Kagalkar, 
Jagtap et al. 2009)  in the biological treatment of dye -containing wastewater has been widely 
studied in recent years. For example, the mechanism behind the biodegradation of dyes by 
bacteria in aerobic conditions was based on the activity of enzymes  that were secreted  (Gupta 
and Suhas 2009) . Kuthia sp . as a new potential bacterium  could  effectively decolorize (92  – 
100%) six triphe nylmethane dyes such as malachit e green, crystal violet, magenta, brilliant 
green, ethyl violet, and pararosaniline (Sani and Banerjee 1999) . Sani and Vasdev’s grou ps 
also reported  the success using several fungal strains to decolorize triphenylmethane and azo 
dyes (Vasdev, Kuhad et al. 1995, Sani and Banerjee 1999) . However, the aerobic treatment  is 
only suitable to degrade  some dyes ; many dyes are nontransformable or nonbiodegradable (Rai, 
Bhattacharyya et al. 2005) .    
2.2.2.2.2 Anaerobic treatment  
Anaerobic treatment has shown promise for efficiently treating a wide range of synthetic dyes 
(Gup ta and Suhas 2009) . Most studies have focused on azo dyes , which are recalcitrant under 
aerobic conditions (Şen and Demirer 2003) . Zee et al. successfully decolorized 20 azo dyes by 
using an aerobic granular sludge  process . They found that the dec olorization was complete or 
nearly complete (>95%) for most o f the dyes (van der Zee, Lettinga et al. 2001) . In anaerobic 
condition, azo dyes were  reductively cleaved of azo linkages, leading to the generation of 
potentially hazardous aromatic amines (Şen and Demirer 2003) . Although the colo r of the dye s 
was removed , the aromatic amines were not completely  mineralized in the end products (Şen 
and Demirer 2003) . Anaerobic treatment can be used for the wastewater with high organic Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
13 
 loads (Delee, O'Neill et al. 1998) , however it has the disadvantage of the production of aromatic 
amines , which are nondegradable (Méndez -Paz, Omil et al. 2005) .    
2.2.2.2.3 Combined aerobic -anaerobic treatment  
The aromatic amines produced by the reduction of azo dyes under anaerobic treatment are 
capable to be degraded under aerobic condition (Seshadri, Bishop et al. 1994, O'neill, Lopez et 
al. 2000) . Moreover, complete mineralization is often observed in an aerobic -anaerobic system 
because of the synergistic effect of various organisms (Stolz 20 01). Therefore, a process with 
combined aerobic -anaerobic conditions is a feasible alternative for the removal of azo dyes 
from wastewater (van der Zee and Villaverde 2005) . An interesting approach reported in the 
literature was to use a  two-stage anaerobic -aerobic system for the removal of sulfonated azo 
dyes, such as acid red 14, acid red 18, and acid orange 10 (Fitzgerald and Bishop 1995) . The 
results revealed that the dye removal rates were greater than 90% for the first two dyes and 
greater than 65% for the last one . The COD removal was around 85% for all three dyes  in the 
first stage; v ery small additional colo r and COD removal was observed in the second stage 
(Fitzgerald and Bishop 1995) . This combined system has been successfully used for the 
decomposition of Remazol Balck B (Panswad, Techovanich et al. 2001) , Proci on Red H -E7B 
(O’Neill, Hawkes et al. 1999) , and Basic Red (Basibuyuk and Forster 1997) .  
Biodegradation of dyes provides an effective, economic al, environmentally -friendly  initial  
process for dye removal (Ali 2010) . The limitation of biological treatments is their less 
flexibility in design and operation , and low biodegradability . Especially, long treatment time  
(few days)  was required for the decolo risation -fermentation processes (Robinson, McMullan 
et al. 2001)  
2.2.2.3 Chemical method  
2.2.2.3.1 Ozonation  
Ozone can degrade most of the dyes due to its high oxidation potential (2.0 7 eV), which is 
much higher than other oxidi zing agents , such as chlorine (1.36  eV) and hydrogen peroxide 
(1.78  eV) (Vandevivere, Bianchi et al. 1998, Robinson, McMullan et al. 2001) . The chemical 
composition s of dye molecules can be modified in the presence of ozone. For example , the 
conjugated double bonds of dye chromophores and complex aromatic rings ar e modified to 
form smaller non -chromophoric molecules, leading to a decrease in the effluent’s color 
(Tehrani -Bagha, Mahmoodi et al. 2010) . It has been reported however that these smaller Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
14 
 molecules might have toxicity or carcino genicity . Ozonation , therefore , should be combined 
with a physical treatment to prevent this (Robinson, McMullan et al. 2001) . Tehrani -Bagha et 
al. investigated ozonat ion for decolorization and degradation of C.I. Reactive blue 19 and found 
that 100% of 800 mg L-1 of the dye was removed after 90 min of ozonation (Teh rani-Bagha, 
Mahmoodi et al. 2010) .  However , the COD and TOC removals were 55% and 17%, 
respectively. The lower COD and TOC removals compared to the degradation suggest an 
incomplete oxidation of the dye (Tehrani -Bagha, Mahmoodi  et al. 2010) . A similar observation 
was reported by Sundrarajan’s group (Sundrarajan, Vishnu et al. 2007) . Ozonation has been 
proven to be an effective way to  treat azo dyes, offering several advantages such as no alteration 
of volume when ozone is added in a gaseous state, and good decolorization efficiency (Saratale, 
Saratale et al. 2011) . The main drawbacks of this technique are high production cost (Gao, 
Hirata et al. 2005) , sho rt half -life (Robinson, McMullan et al. 2001) , low COD removal and 
ineffective ness for non -soluble dyes and disperse d dyes (Saratale, Saratale et al. 2011) . 
2.2.2.3.2 Advanced oxidation pr ocesses  
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are widely known as powerful technologies for the 
treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater (Al-Kdasi, Idris et al. 2004, Stasinakis 2008, 
Oller, Malato et al. 2011, Valcárcel, Martínez et al. 2012, Vaiano, Iervolino et al. 2017) . These 
processes use several oxidants such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide and air , whic h can be 
combined with UV illumination and specific catalysts to produce hydroxyl radicals (Bau er and 
Fallmann 1997, Al -Kdasi, Idris et al. 2004, Klavarioti, Mantzavinos et al. 2009, Tisa, Abdul 
Raman et al. 2014) . Table 2 .2 summarizes various AOPs for dye  wastewater  treatment.  
Among AOPs, Fenton -type reactions have been reported as effective in the removal of 
recalcitrant compounds in wastewater. These reactions generate strongly oxidizing agents 
(hydroxyl radicals) as a r esult of the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and iron salts 
(Pouran, Raman et al. 2014) . Due to their hi gh oxidation potential (2.8  eV), the hydroxyl 
radicals can oxidize a large number of organic compounds to carbon dioxide and inorganic ions 
(Pera -Titus, Garcı́a-Molina et al. 2004, García -Montaño, Pérez -Estrada et al. 2008, Shin, Yoon 
et al. 2008) . When the Fenton process is combined with irradiation by ultraviolet (UV) or 
visible light or both light sources, it is known as a photo -Fenton process. Photo -assisted 
processes can be driven by radiation from the UV to the visible light range (~550 nm) (Hislop 
and Bolton 1999) . As compared with UV, t he use of solar irradiation as a light source in photo -
Fenton processes is of grea ter interest due to its economic and environmental merits (Pérez, Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
15 
 Torrades et al. 2002, García -Montaño, Pérez -Estrada et al. 2008, Tanveer and Tezcanli Guyer 
2013) . However, there are some major drawbacks when using ferrous ion as the homogeneous 
catalyst in the Fenton or photo -Fenton process, such as a narrow working pH range (pH ˂ 4), 
generation of a secondary pollutant (iron oxide sludge) which is difficult to be remove d (Kasiri, 
Aleboyeh et al. 2008, Yaping and Jiangyong 2008) . Numerous attempts have been made to 
develop heterogen eous Fenton and photo -Fenton catalysts with high photocatalytic 
performance, long -term stability and reusability for the degradation of organic pollutants in 
wastewater (Palas, Ersöz et al. , Luo, Zhu et al. 2010, Sannino, Ciambelli et al. 2010, Soltani 
and Entezari 2014, García, Pedroza et al. 2017, Vorontsov 2018) . The use of heterogeneous 
catalysts brings a number of advantageous features . For example, they normally have 
noncorrosive and environmentally -friendly property.  In particular, they are relatively easy to 
be separated from th e effluent  after the treatment (Soon and Hameed 2011) . The photo -Fenton 
system also benefits from a synergistic effect between photocatalysis and Fenton oxidation, 
which can make the degradation of organic  pollutant s more effectively as com pared with 
photocatalysis or Fenton oxidation individually (Ye, Yang et al. 2018) .

 2.3. Perovskites and its use  for photo -Fenton processes  
2.3.1 Introduction to perovskites  
Perovskites are a class of crystalline inorganic solids having a general formula of ABO 3 or 
A2BO 4 where A and B are rare -earth metal and transition metal cations, respectively (Zhang 
and Li 2013, Zhu, Li et al. 2014) . In the ABO 3 crystal structure, the A site is usually occupied 
by the bigger cation and is coordinated by 12 oxygen anions. It is located in the spaces between 
the BO 6 octahedra. The B site is  occupied by the smaller cation  and is coordinated by s ix O2- 
to form BO 6 octahedra units ( Fig. 2.1). The minimum cationic radii of A and B are r A > 0.09 
nm and r B > 0.051 nm, respectively (Zhu, Li et al. 2014) . The A 2BO 4 structure comprises 
alternating ABO 3 and AO layers (Zhu, Li et al. 2014) . The ideal perovskite structure is cubic. 
Howeve r, different crystal geometries such as orthorhombic, rhombohedral, tetragonal, 
monoclinic and triclinic can be formed by tilting of BO 6 octahedra or the substitution of foreign 
cations having a different ion radius or oxidation state into A - site and/or B -site (Voorhoeve, 
Johnson et al. 1977, Pena and Fierro 2001) . The allowed degree of cation displacement at A -
sites and/or B -sites is quite limited, as too great a displacement would result in str ess on the 
skeleton and destroy the structure. In the ABO 3 structure, all the cations should meet the 
requirement that the tolerance factor t satisfies 0.75 < t < 1.0, where t = (r A + rO)/(√2(r B + rO)), 
and r A, rB and r O are the ionic radii of A, B and O -site occupants, respectively (Goldschmidt 
1926) . The substitution of an ion with a different radius or oxidation state into an A -site and/or 
a B-site could affect the oxidation state of the cation at the B -site and  the number of oxygen 
vacancies (Zhu, Li et al. 2014) . Therefore, physicochemical properties relating to catalytic 
performance could be controlled by substitution with foreign cations. Also , different degrees 
of tilting of the octahedra lead to different crystal structure s, which could have a great influence 
on optical and electronic properties such as band structure, electron and hole transport and 
dielectric behavior (Lin, Cheng et al. 2006, Zhang, Tang et al. 2006) . Fig. 2.1 illustrates the 
ideal ABO 3 and A 2BO 4 perovskite structures (Zhu, Li et al. 2014) . Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

2.3.2 Synthesis of perovskites  and their properties  
It is well known that the preparation method plays an important role in the synthesis of any 
catalytic material. Minor alterations in the preparation procedure can cause dramatic changes 
in the  chemical and physical  properties of the final product , such as morphology, structure , and 
size of material (Li, Wang et al. 2017) . Based on the target applications, many approaches have 
been reported for the synthesis of perovskite -type photocatalysts such as the sol -gel (HEIDARI, 
Fazaeli et al. 2012, An, Zhu et al. 2013, Orak, Atalay et al. 2016, Soltani and Lee 2016, Soltani 
and Lee 2017, Jia, Wu et al. 2018) , sol-gel auto -combustion (Jauhar, Dhiman et al. 2015) , 
modified -solution combustion (Des hpande, Aruna et al. 2011, Bhoi and Mishra 2018) , 
hydrothermal (Rigo, Severo et al. 2017, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 
2018) , dry-wet composition (Song, Xu et al. 2007) , solvothermal (Vanga, Mangalaraja et al. 
2018) ,  self-propagating combustion (Li and Wang 2016) , electrospinning (Jeong, Song et al. 
2018)  and sol -gel process combined with vacuum microwave ca lcination methods (Shen, Xue 
et al. 2016) . Table 2.3 summarises the synthe tic methods for perovskites th at have been studied 
as the photo -Fenton catalysts for dye degradation. In this section, two of the main synthetic 
methods – the sol -gel method and the hydrothermal method , are discussed.

 2.3.2.1 Sol -gel method  
The sol -gel method is an effective technique for fabricating new compositions because it 
enables control of the stoichiometry and homogeneity of the final products (Livage, Henry et 
al. 1988, Livage 1992, Brinker and Scherer 2013) . Moreover, the sol -gel proces s offers the 
advantages of producing well -crystallized  and fine particles at relatively low temperatures. 
Wang et al. reported a Pechini -type sol -gel method to synthesize  LaAl 1-xCuxO3 (x= 0 -0.1), 
which used a mixture of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as an additive and citric acid as the 
chelating agent (Wang, Zhang et al. 2018) , as shown in Fig. 2.2. This method was also used to 
synthesize  sphere -like LaAl 1-xCuxO3 perovskite particles wi th an average size of 80  – 100 nm, 
in which Cu was uniformly distributed over the material’s surface. Smaller LaFeO 3 particles 
(40 nm ) were produced using only citric acid as the chelating agent  (Nie, Zhang et al. 2015) . 
EuFeO 3 particles with plate -like grains were  prepared by the sol -gel method with the aid of 
tartaric acid (Ju, Chen et al. 2011) . Other s works also reported the preparation of perovskites 
with tailorable morphologies  by varying the selection of reagents  or additives  in the sol -gel, 
such as LnFeO 3 (Ln=Pr, Y) worm -like particles (Li, Zhang et al. 2014)  and BiFeO 3 spheres 
(Soltani and Lee 2017) .

starting from the mixture of ion precursors, citric acid and polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) (Wang, 
Zhang et al. 2018) . 
2.3.2.2 Hydrothermal method  
The hydrothermal method has become one of the important and attractive tools to synthesize 
perovskite particles with controllable size, good purity , high  crystallinity  and well -defined 
morphology (Nguyen 2013, Shi, Song et al. 2013) . In the hydrothermal synthesis of 
Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 perovskites, either metal salts or metal oxides can be used as the precursors and then react or 
coordinate with other additives (such as citric acid) to form complexes . After calcination, the 
desired perovskite materials  are obtained  (Wada, Chikamori et al. , Barnabé, Gaudon et al. 
2004, Deng, Dai et al. 2010, Huo, Jin et al. 2010) . The morphological, structural, and chemical 
properties of the particles can be controlled by the hydrothermal reaction temperature  and time, 
synthetic solution pH and starting materials (Adhyapak, Meshram et al. 2014, Wen, Hu et al. 
2014) . For example, so far, the perovskites in the shapes of disks (Tong, Zhang et al. 2016) , 
cubes, rods, and polyhedron (Yuan, Huang et al. 2016)  have been reported in the literatures. 
The selection of hydrothermal reaction time can affect the phase formation as well as the 
particle size of perovskite s produced with using this method (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 
2012, Gao, Chen et al. 2015, Cao, Chen et al. 2016) . Thirumalairajan and co -workers claimed 
that LaFeO 3 which were prepared after 6-h hydrothermal method show ed the nanoparticles of 
irregular shape with an average size of ~ 60 nm . When the reaction time was extended to 12 h, 
spher ical nanoparticles with an average size of 70 nm were synthesized  (Thirumalairajan, 
Girija et al. 2012) . The use of different iron precursors  for the hydrothermal synthesis was also 
found to tailor the morphologies of resulting LaFeO 3 products and eventually their photo -
Fenton catalytic activities  (Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018) . The LaFeO 3 sample which w as 
prepared using  Fe(NO 3)3, Fe(C 5H7O2)3, or C6H5FeO 7 as ion precursor showed agglomerated  
and spherical particles with a size of ~100 nm ; whilst the use of K 3Fe(CN) 6 produced porous 
cubic -like LaFeO 3 particles with an average size of 4 μm . In addition,  synthetic solution pH 
was found to change the morphologies of perovskites, such as BiFeO 3 (Zhou, Li et al. 2016) . 
When the concentrations of HNO 3 and NaOH were 8 and 12 M, respectively, the BiFeO 3 was 
observed to have a cylindrical shape with a height of 1 µm and a width of 0.6 µm, as shown in 
Fig. 2.3a. By increasing the concentration of NaOH , the surface of  the BiFeO 3 cylinders  
became rough (Fig. 2.3b) and even collapsed  (Fig. 2.3c) (Zhou, Li et al. 2016) .

The hydrothermal method allows to eliminate or minimize of high -temperature calcination  or 
conditioning steps (Shandilya, Rai et al. 2016) . Furthermore, the perovskite -based materials 
with various  morphological, structural, and chemical properties can be obtained from  the 
hydrothermal synthesis  by adjusting a number of parameters, including synthetic temperature, 
reaction time and solution composition ; this makes the products  suitable for a wide range of 
applications.  
2.3.3 Perovskite lanthanum ferrite LaFeO 3 (LFO) and its features  
LaFeO 3 (LFO) is one of the most common ABO 3 perovskites with an orthorhombic structure 
(Vijayaraghavan, Sivasubramanian et al. 2017) . In LFO, the larger La cations occupy the 
cavities between layers of corner -sharing FeO 6 octahedra and the smaller Fe cations are located 
at the cent er, as shown in Fig. 2.4a. The tilt angle between the octahedra (α) represents the 
distortion of the perovskite structure in comparison with an ideal structure. The higher the value 
of α, the less distorted the structure is (Hayes and Grosvenor 2011) .

Fig. 2.4. (a) Unit cell of orthorhombic LFO showing the tilted FeO 6 octahedra (grey octahedra) 
and La atoms (larger grey spheres) occupying the cavities between layers of the octahedra 
(Hayes and  Grosvenor 2011)  and (b) XRD pattern of orthorhombic phase LFO (Yang, Huang 
et al. 2006) . 
The lattice parameters of LFO are a = 5.5663 Å, b = 7.8544 Å and c = 5.5533 Å in the Pnma 
setting of  the orthorhombic space group 62 (Vijayarag havan, Sivasubramanian et al. 2017) . 
Yang et al. (Yang, Huang et al. 2006)  performed X -ray diffraction (XRD) analys is of LFO 
which was prepared by the solid -state reaction method and determined that all the characteristic 
peaks presented in Fig. 2.4b were  assigned to the orthorhombic LFO structure (JCPDS, card 
number 37 -1493).  
Among the rare -earth orthoferrites, LFO is well known as a G -type antiferromagnet wi th a high 
Néel temperature (TN ~ 740 °C) (Ivanov, Tellgren et al. 2012) , which makes LFO a potential 
candidate as a spintronic or ferromagnetic material (Selbach, Tolchard et al. 2012) . At room 
temperature, LFO also exhibits ferroelasticity (Abrahams, Bar ns et al. 1972) . However , LFO 
is not considered to be a multiferroic material (Selbach, Tolchard et al. 2012) . The magnetic 
properties of LFO originate from the interactions between the magnetic moments of La and Fe 
atoms. It has been reported by Ivanov et al. that all the electrons of a La atom are in a pair, 
which indicates La3+ is non -magnetic and subsequently there is no magnetic interaction 
between La3+ and Fe3+. Therefore, the magnetization pattern of LFO nanoparticles is governed 
by the Fe sub -lattices (Wei, Wang et al. 2012) . The results of Ivanov et al. revealed that in the 
Fe sub -lattices, the magnetic moments of Fe3+ were  slightly canted, and this is the source of 
the ferromagnetic character at room tempera ture of LFO nanoparticles which were prepared by 
an auto -combustion process. The antiferromagnetic property of LFO is caused by the collinear 
arrangement of the sub -lattices, as shown in Fig. 2.5 (Lee, Yun et al. 2014) . These

 antife rromagnetic particles often display increasing magnetization because of the presence of 
uncompensated surface spins (Kodama and Berkowitz 1999, Lee, Pakhomov et al. 2010) .  
 
Fig. 2.5. Schematic diagram of LFO antiferromagnetic order modified from  the reference  
(Shein, Shein et al. 2005) , showing the up and down magnetic spin of Fe atoms (black spheres).  
The magnetization of LFO nanoparticles is different from the bulk crystals. For example, the 
spontaneous magnetization value of LFO bulk crystals was 0.1 emu/g at ambient temperature 
(Shen, Cheng et al. 2009) , which is considerably smaller than the values for LFO nanoparticles 
(~ 21.9 nm) prepared by the sol -gel method (0.38 emu/g) (Saad, Khan et al. 2013) , LFO 
nanofibers (~ 20 nm) fabricated by electrospinning (0.9 emu/g) (Lee, Yun et al. 2014) , and 
LFO nanoparticles (~25 -50 nm) synthesized via a sol -gel combustion process (0.35 emu/g) 
(Hui, Jiayue et al. 2010) . The magnetization values of these LFO nanomaterials are different, 
suggesting that preparation procedures , particle size and surface characteristics play key roles 
in controlling the properties of the product particles (Kumar, Raja et al. 2014) . It can be seen 
that a reduction in LFO particle size leads to an increase in magnetization (Phokha, 
Pinitsoontorn et al. 2014, Qiu, Luo et al. 2014) . LFO exhibits ferromagnetism, which facilitates 
recycling of the material with a magnetic field after it has been used in photocatalytic 
degradation of dyes.  
LFO has the potential to be an efficient photocatalyst because of its narrow  band gap energy 
(Köferstein, Jäger et al. 2013, Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2013, Abazari, Sanati et al. 2014, 
Ren, Yang et al. 2016, Soltanabadi, Jourshabani et al. 2018) . The band gap energy (E g) is the 
minimum energy required for an electron in a semiconductor to jump from a valence band to a 
conduction band. The band gap energy depends on the frequency of incident light through Tauc 
and Menth’s law (Tauc and Menth 1972) : 
                                      αhν = k(hν - Eg)n 
Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 where h is Planck’s constant,  ν is light frequency, α is the optical absorption coefficient, k is a 
constant for the electron transition, Eg is the band gap energy, and n is a constant depending on 
the type of electronic transition (n = 1/2, 2, 3/2 and 3 for allowed direct, allowed indirect, 
forbidden direct and forbidden indirect electronic transitions, respectively) (Ryu, Bang et al. 
2007) .  
The band gap energy of LFO was found to be between 2.07 and 3.87 eV by using optical 
spectroscopy techniques (Parida, Reddy et al. 2010, Abazari, Sanati et al. 2014, Kumar and 
Jayavel 2014, Jeong, Song et al. 2018) . For example, Jeong et al. used  diffused reflectance UV -
Vis (DRUV -vis) spectra to measure the band gap energy of LFO nanofibers prepared by the 
electrospinning method (Jeong, Song et al. 2018) . The reflectance spectra were then converted 
into the Kubelka -Munk function (F(R)) using the equation F(R) = (1 -R)2/2R (Pang, Chen et al. 
2001) . The direct band gap values of LFO and Mn -doped LFO were determined by plotting 
[F(R)×hν]2 vs hν and extrapolating the linear part of the curve to zero, as illustrated in Fig. 2.6. 
Their  results revealed that the band gap energy of LFO decreased from 2.47 to 2.21 eV as the 
Mn loading was increased.  
 
Fig. 2.6. (a) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of Mn -doped LFO and (b) Calculation diagrams 
for corresponding bandgaps  (the inset show s the band gap values with various Mn 
concentrations ) (Jeong, Song et al. 2018) . 
Using a similar a pproach to investigate the band gap energy of LFO synthesi zed by a sol -gel 
auto-combustion method, Parida’s group determined that the band gap values of LFO 
nanoparticles  varied from 2.07 to 2.45 eV depending on the preparation procedures and 
activation temperatures. This suggests that the strong absorption in the visible light range of 
LFO could be attributed to the electronic transition from the valence band to the conduction

 band (O 2p → Fe3d) (Parida, Reddy et al. 2010) . This is in good agreement with the observations 
of Abazari et al. (Abazari, Sanati et al. 2014) .  
Scafetta et al. reported a combined theoretical and exper imental stud y in which the band gap of 
LFO was calculated using the Tauc model (Scafetta, Cordi et  al. 2014) . They used density 
functional theory to determine the E g of LFO. Their results revealed that LFO beh aved as a 
forbidden direct bandgap semiconductor with the band gap value of ~ 2.34 eV, which is in 
excellent agreement with experimental data (Scafetta, Cordi et al. 2014) .   
Note that t he band gap energies (E g) of LFO differ in the previous studies  (Table 2.4) , which 
could be due to the selection of different preparation methods and synthetic solution and in turn 
the variation in the particle sizes, morphologies and structures of the perovskite produced.

 2.4. Mechanism of photo -Fenton degradation of dye using perovskite s 
Perovskite -based photocatalysts have been widely used as heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like 
catalysts for dye degradation (Ju, Chen et al. 2011, Li, Wang et al. 2013, Chen, Yang et al.  
2014, Li and Wang 2016, Shen, Xue et al. 2016, Li, Wang et al. 2017, Vanga, Mangalaraja et 
al. 2018) . Understanding the mechanism is critically important for optimizing the process as 
well as developing new strategies for preparing materials. In this section, a brief review of the 
photo -Fenton catalytic mechanism is provided.  
The photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of dyes  using perovskite -type catalysts is believed to 
occur via two simultaneous pathways: (i) the Fenton mechanism and (ii) a photocatalytic 
process under light irradiation (Ju, Chen et al. 2011, Li, Wang et al. 2014, Li, Zhang et al. 2014, 
Li, Zhang et al. 2014, Soltanabadi, Jourshabani et al. 2018) . Fig. 2.7 shows a schematic of 
Rhodamine B ( RhB) photo -Fenton degradation mechanisms over LFO as an example. As can 
be seen from Fig. 2.7, LFO can absorb visible light to generate electrons in its valence band, 
which are then trapped by H 2O2 to produce hydroxyl radicals •OH. Meanwhile, Fe3+ in LFO 
can also participate in Fenton reaction to form hydroxyl radicals •OH. The generated hydroxyl 
radicals •OH attack dye m olecules and then convert them to degradation products.  The 
degradation mechanisms in the Fig. 2.7 are explained as follows:  
In the Fenton reaction (Kwan and V oelker 2003) , a complex of ≡FeIIIH2O2 forms between 
≡FeIII and H 2O2 (Eq. ( 2.1)), where ≡FeIII stands for Fe (III) sites on the catalyst surface. The 
initially generated ≡FeIIIH2O2 is then converted into ≡FeII and HO 2• (Eq. ( 2.2)). The HO 2• 
subsequently reacts with ≡FeIII to produce ≡FeII (Eq. ( 2.3)). The ≡FeII reacts with H 2O2 to 
generate •OH radicals (Eq. ( 2.4)), which induce the degradation of the organic dye (Eq. ( 2.11)). 
The photo -Fenton process is similar to the Fenton reaction, but th e introduction of light 
irradiation improves the degradation. Under light irradiation, the reduction of Fe(III) can be 
accelerated, yielding additional reactive •OH (Eq. ( 2.5)), which degrade the target organic dye 
(Herney -Ramirez, Vicente et al. 2010) .  
The second pathway is explained as follows. In a photo -Fenton process, the light source 
provides energy to activate the photocatalyst. When an ABO 3 aqueous suspension is 
illuminated with light with energy eq ual to or greater than its band gap energy, an ele ctron -hole 
pair is generated due to the excitation of an electron from the valence band (VB) to the 
conduction band (CB), leaving a positive hole (h+) in the VB, as shown in Eq. ( 2.6). In the Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 presence of hydrogen peroxide, the electrons are trapped by the hydrogen peroxide to produce 
hydroxyl radicals (Eq. ( 2.7)), or self -decomposed to hydroxyl radicals under UV light 
irradiation (Eq. ( 2.10), which directly oxidize the dye, as represented in Eq. ( 2.11).  
Based on the above discussion, a photo -Fenton -like photocatalytic degradation mechanism 
under visible can be represented as follows (Li, Wang et al. 2014, Li, Zhang et al. 2014, 
Soltanabadi, Jourshabani et al. 2018) : 
≡FeIII + H 2O2 → ≡FeIIIH2O2   (2.1) 
≡FeIIIH2O2 → ≡FeII + HO 2• + H+ (2.2) 
≡FeIII + HO 2•+ H+ → ≡FeII + O 2 + 2H+ (2.3) 
≡FeII + H 2O2 → ≡FeIII + •OH + OH- (2.4) 
≡FeIII + OH- →  ≡FeIII(OH) + ℎ𝑣 → ≡FeII + •OH (2.5) 
* Under visible light:  
ABO 3 + hʋ → 𝑒𝑐𝑏− + ℎ𝑣𝑏+ (2.6) 
H2O2 + 𝑒𝑐𝑏− →•OH + OH- (2.7) 
dye + hυ → dye* (2.8) 
dye + ℎ𝑣𝑏+ → dye+ (2.9) 
* Under UV light irradiation (λ > 313 nm), the decomposition of H 2O2 can also occur 
(Martínez, Calleja et al. 2005) : 
H2O2 +  hʋ → 2•OH (2.10) 
•OH + dye (or dye+) → Degradation products  (2.11) 
The •OH radical is considered as a strong oxidizing agent because of its st andard redox potential 
(+ 2.8V)  and can oxidize  the majority of azo dyes (Konstantinou and Albanis 2004) . The role 
of h+vb in the oxidation of organics has not been conclusively explained (Wang, Tadé et al. 
2015) . However, Li and co -workers proposed that h+vb activate d the dye* (which is formed by 
light absorption by the dye) to dye+, which was then oxidized by the •OH radical (Li, Wang et Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 al. 2013) . Soltanabadi’s group proposed a  similar explanation of the role of the photogenerated 
hole in the photo -Fenton removal of RhB and phenol  when using CuO -coupled LFO  
(Soltanabadi, Jourshabani et al. 2018) . The trapping experiments were employed to determine 
the main active species in the photo -Fenton degradation of dyes over perovskite -type catalysts   
(Chen, Yang et al. 2 014). Chen et al. concluded that photogenerated holes and hydroxyl 
radicals are the main active species for the photo -Fenton degradation of RhB using YFeO 3 as 
a catalyst (Chen, Yang et al. 2014) . In their research, IPA, TEOA , and AgNO 3 were  used to 
quench •OH radicals,  h+vb, and e-cb, respectively. It was found that the photo -Fenton degradation 
of RhB using YFeO 3 significantly decreased when 1mM of TEOA or 1mM of IPA were added ; 
while AgNO 3 had a negligible effect on the dye removal rate . This is in a good agreement with 
the findings in Soltanabadi ’s work  (Soltanabadi, Jourshabani et al. 2018) .    
 
Fig. 2.7. Schematic of Rhodamine B ( RhB) degradation mechanism over LFO (Phan, 
Nikoloski et al. 2018) . 
Further  evidence that the light enhanced photo -Fenton catalytic reaction is due to the generation 
of photo -induced charge carriers (electrons and holes) followed by  the production of  •OH 
radicals is seen in s everal other studies . In those works,  •OH radicals were detected by using 
indirect detection techniques , which include the introduction of a probe molecule in the 
solution  and then  the use of  photoluminescence (PL), electron spin resonance (ESR), or 
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (Ju, Chen et al. 2011, Sheng, Li et al. 2014, Phan, 
Nikoloski et al. 2018, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018, Wang, Zhang et al. 2018, Ye, Yang et al. 
2018) . For example, Ju et al. used a photoluminescence (PL) technique for the detection of •OH 
radicals, as shown in Fig.  2.8 (Ju, Chen et al. 2011) . This method use d terephthalic acid (TA) , 
which react ed with •OH present to generate a highly fluorescent product, 2 -hydroxyterephthalic 
acid (HTA). The PL intensity of HTA  was proportional to the number of •OH radic als. Their

 results showed an increase in PL intensity with increas ing irradiation time, which indicated that 
•OH radicals were generated and participate d in the photo -Fenton reaction. Wang et al. 
investigated the generation of •OH radicals for a LaFeO 3/carbon nanocomposite in aqueous 
solution using TA as a fluorescence probe (Wang, Niu et al. 2017) . They found a gradual 
increase in PL intensity at around 425 nm during the reaction, suggesting the production of 
•OH radicals under visible light. Similar observation  was also reported by Ye et al. (Ye, Yang 
et al. 2018) .    
 
Fig. 2.8. Photoluminescence spectra of the aqueous basic solution of terephatalic acid (TA) 
with an excitation at  315 nm  in the presence of EuFeO3, which was synthesized after 700, 750 
and 800 °C calcination  for 3 h. The i nset is the PL spectra changing with the visible -light 
irradiation time for the case using 750 °C -calcined EuFeO3  nanoparticles  (Ju, Chen et al. 
2011) . 
Other researchers have applied the electron spin resonance (ESR) spin -trap technique to detect 
•OH radicals during the photo -Fenton degradation of dye under visible light (Sheng, Li et al. 
2014, Phan,  Nikoloski et al. 2018, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018, Wang, Zhang et al. 2018) . They 
employed 5,5 -dimethyl -1-pyrroline N -oxide (DMPO) as a spin trap that altered highly active 
species to the stable adduct DMPO/•OH. As illustrated in Fi g. 2.9, Phan et al. reported that the 
ESR spectra had 4 characteristic peaks of the DMPO/•OH adduct  (an intensity of 1 : 2 : 2 : 1 ), 
which was measured  from the sample in the presence of  LFO catalyst and H2O2 before visible 
light irradiation . It might be explained by the reactions shown in Eqs. (2.1) – (2.5) (Phan, 
Nikoloski et al. 2018) . Interestingly, after visible light irradiation, the intensity of these 
DMPO/•OH peaks was much higher than that in the dark system . On the other side, in the 
Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
30 
 absenc e of H 2O2, no characteristic peaks of DMPO/•OH adduct were found in the dye -
containing water sample with LFO catalyst. This suggested that the electrons which were 
generated by the excitation of the catalyst under visible light irradiation might be trapped  by 
H2O2 to produce •OH ( see Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7 )), which  were the reactive species involved in 
the heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like reaction process.  
 
Fig. 2.9. ESR spectra of DMPO -•OH adducts in the system of LFO/H2O2/dark  (the RhB 
solution with LFO and H2O2 in dark)  and LFO/H2O2/light  (the RhB solution with LFO and 
H2O2 under light illumination) . For comparison, the ESR spectra for the systems of LFO/light  
(the RhB solution with LFO under light illumination)  and LFO/dark  (the RhB solution with 
LFO in dark)  were included  (testing conditions: 100 µL of 10 mg L -1 RhB; 20 µL of 0.2 mol 
L-1 DMPO; reaction time: 2 mins)  (Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018) .  
In the photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of organic compounds, the recombination of 
photoexcited electrons and holes reduces the efficiency of degradation. It is therefore desirable 
to minimi ze electron -hole recombination  (Eq.(2.12)). There have been many studies aimed at 
suppressing this recombination  by optimizing  operation conditions and material characteristics  
(Huang, Xin et al. 2016, Soltani and Lee 2016, S undararajan, Sailaja et al. 2017, Jin, Zhou et 
al. 2018, Mutalib, Aziz et al. 2018, Song, Xue et al. 2018) .

  2.5. Effect of operational parameters  on photo -Fenton degradation  
2.5.1 Catalyst dosage  
It is well known that the efficiency of photo -Fenton -like reactions for dye degradation is 
strongly affected by the amount of photocatalyst s. Heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like 
degradation of dye s has seen with  an enhancement by increasing the dosage of photocatalys ts. 
This can be explained by the increase of active sites on the photocatalyst surface, leading to 
more  hydroxyl radicals generated and in turn greater degradation of dye s. However, f urther 
increase in photocatalyst dosage might limit light penetration into the solution, resulting in a 
lower photo -Fenton degradation  efficiency  (Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018) . An excess of the 
catalyst can also cause agglomeration of catalyst particles  and in turn  make a part of the catalyst 
surface unavailable for photo -absorption ; this would contribute to the reduced  photocatalytic 
performance (Rusevova, Köferstein et al. 2014) . Soltanabadi et al. suggested the optimum 
CuO(50%)/LFO dosage used for visible -light photo -Fenton degradation of RhB (30 ppm) as 
1.5 g L-1 (Soltanabadi, Jourshabani et al. 2018) . The further increase of dosage, e.g. 2 g L-1, 
advers ely affected the dye removal . Tong et al.  varied the amount of BiFeO 3 used for the photo -
Fenton removal of methyl orange (MO) from 0.5 to 3.0 g L-1 (Tong, Zhang et al. 2016) . At 2.0 
g L-1, the maximum deg radation rate, ~97% , was reached. However, a further increase in 
catalyst dosage caused a drop in removal efficiency . Therefore, the optimum photocatalyst 
dosage needs to be determined for any photocatalyst system to avoid unnecessary use of 
photocatalyst as well as to ensure the efficient absorption of photons.   
2.5.2 H 2O2 concentration  
In the photo -Fenton process, t he concentration of H 2O2 plays an important role (An, Zhu et al. 
2013) . Reported studies indicate that there is an optimum H 2O2 concentration for the photo -
Fenton photocatalytic degradation of dyes (Rusevova , Köferstein et al. 2014) . This could be 
attributed to the fact that H 2O2 plays two roles: (i) a source for hydroxyl radical (•OH) and (ii) 
a consumer of •OH. Kwan and co -workers claimed that under  the conditions where H 2O2 
became the dominant consumer of hydroxyl radicals, an increase in H 2O2 concentration did not 
significantly improve the removal of contaminants (Kwa n and Voelker 2003) .  
It was reported by An et al. that H 2O2 concentration had a great influence on the degradation 
of Methyl Violet (MV) and RhB using BiFeO 3 as a catalyst (An, Zhu et al. 2013) . Their results 
revealed that hydrogen peroxid e concentrations below 20 mmol L-1 improved the Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
32 
 photocatalytic efficiency due to the increase in hydroxyl radicals (•OH). However, above that 
concentration, an excess of •OH was generated, leading to the quenching of radicals. In 
addition, •OH radicals could be consumed at high concentrations of H 2O2 to form some less 
reactive species, such as HO 2•, which may have furthe r contributed to the reduced removal .  
Tong et al. also investigated the influence of H 2O2 concentration on the removal of 10 mg L-1 
of MO solution (Tong, Zhang et al. 2016) . The removal was found to incr ease by increasing 
H2O2 concentration. Their experiment was performed for a H 2O2 concentration range of 20  – 
120 mM. The authors reported that the highest MO removal , ~97% , was achieved at 80 mM 
H2O2, suggesting that addition of an optimum concentration of  H2O2 enhanced the photo -
Fenton reaction.  
2.5.3  Initial solution pH 
The influence of solution pH on the photo -Fenton degradation of dyes in aqueous solution has 
been investigated in many studies (An, Zhu et al. 2013, Jamali, Singh et al. 2017, Palas, Ersöz 
et al. 2017, Soltanabadi, Jourshabani et al. 2018) . For some dyes, such as tartrazine and m ethyl 
orange , their removal by the photo -Fenton degradation was more effective at lower pH (Palas, 
Ersöz et al. 2017, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018) . One the other side, some dyes , such as red allur a 
and methy l violet,  were  found more effective ly removed at higher pH (An, Zhu et al. 2013, 
Vaiano, Iervolino et al. 2015) . The elucidation of the effect of solution pH on degradation 
efficiency in the heterogeneous photo -Fenton systems seems to be difficult due to its multiple 
roles.  
Firstly, pH affects the adsorption of dyes onto the photocatalyst surface, which is one of the 
most important steps in the photo -Fenton reaction (Li and Ye 2007, An, Zhu et al. 2013) .  This 
is mainly due to the surface c harge propert ies of photocatalysts  and dyes . Soltanabadi et al. 
investigated the effect of pH on the photo -Fenton degradation of RhB using a CuO(50%)/ LFO 
photocatalyst and found that the removal rate of RhB increased at higher  solution pH 
(Soltanabadi, Jourshabani et al. 2018) . The authors reported that at ac idic pH, the surface 
charge of CuO(50%)/ LFO was positive , while at alkaline pH it was negative. At very acidic 
pH (pH below 6), the degradation performance decrease d due to the electrostatic repulsion 
between the positive surface charge of the photocatalyst and cationic RhB. At higher pH, the 
negative surface charge of CuO(50%)/ LFO was favorable for the strong adsorption of cationic 
RhB, leading to a reduction in active sites on the photocatalyst surface which decreased  the 
degradation efficienc y. Similar findings were also reported for the study  using LaCuO 3 as the Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
33 
 photocatalyst in the photo -Fenton -like oxidation of Tartrazine (Palas, Ersöz et al. 2017) . 
Secondly, solution pH can control the production of •OH radicals , which affects the photo -
degradation efficiency (Rahman, Yus uf et al. 2010) . For example, a base solution pH can result 
in the decomposition of H 2O2 to less reactive species than •OH radicals. It was suggested by 
Phan  et al. , that the low degradation of RhB at pH > 6 was due to the decomposition of H 2O2 
into les s reactive hydroperoxyl radicals HO 2• (Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018) .  
2.5.4 Initial dye concentration  
Studies have indicated that there is an optimal concentration of dye s for which the pho -
perovskite -based catalysts reach their highest activity  in the photo -Fenton reaction . The results 
of Sundararajan et al. indicated that the photocatalytic activity of cobalt ferrite strongly 
depended on the initial concentration of RhB  (Sundararajan, Sailaja et al. 2017) . The RhB 
degradation decreased from 99.9% to 8.4 % as the initial RhB concentration increased from 2 
to 10 mg L-1. The authors proposed that at th e lower concentration of 2 mg L-1, sufficient •OH 
radicals were generated on the photocatalyst surface to degrade RhB. However, at higher RhB 
concentrations, RhB molecules might block  the active sites and consequently the degradation 
was reduced . This is i n agreement with other works  (Severo, Anchieta et al. 2016) . It should 
also be noted that  high concentration of dye can decrease the amount of light reaching the 
photocatalyst, leading to  the lower formation of •OH radicals (Sundararajan, Sailaja et al. 
2017) .           
2.5.5 Effect of light source   
The photo -Fenton degradation of dyes using a perovskite photocatalyst under light irradiation 
is mainly initiated by the generation of •OH radicals via Eq. (2.13) and Eq. (2.14): 
ABO 3 + hʋ → 𝑒𝑐𝑏− + ℎ𝑣𝑏+ (2.13)  
H2O2 + 𝑒𝑐𝑏− → •OH + OH- (2.14)  
Light source  plays an essential role in governing  the efficient separation of the electron -hole 
pair over the photocatalyst via Eq. (2.13). The wavelength s as well as the intensity of ligh t are 
important factors (Pérez, Torrades et a l. 2002, Feng, Hu et al. 2003) . Palas et al. studied the 
effect of light source on the photo -Fenton -like degradation of Tartrazine using a LaCuO 3 
photocatalyst (Palas, Ersöz et al. 2017) . Their experiments were performed under UV and 
visible light irradiation . The results revealed that the decolorization of 100 ppm Tartrazine was Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
34 
 90.2% under UV light and 83.9% under visible light irradiation, suggesting that the UV light 
was more effective than the visible light even though the UV lamp had a much smaller power  
(6W) than the visible light lamp (80W). This is consistent with the findings of other studies 
(Li, Dong et al. 2014, Fotiou, Triantis et al. 2015) , where the de gradation of pollutants was 
stronger under UV light illumination than under solar irradiation. Finding  a commonly agreed 
explanation for this difference  is difficult . However , a reasonable explanation is that under UV 
light irradiation, direct photolysis o f H 2O2 generates more •OH radicals (Kumar 2011) . Sheng 
et al. also show ed that more •OH radicals were generated  under UV light than under visible 
light by comparing the ESR signals of the DMPO/•OH adduct (Sheng, Li et al. 2014) . This 
needs further study as although the degradat ion of dyes seems to be more effective under UV 
light than visible light, the use of visible light for the photo -Fenton reaction would be more 
economically favo rable (Chen, Xie et al. 2001, Perez, Torrades et al. 2002) . 
2.5.6 Effect of co -existing anions  
Inorganic ions such as nitrate (NO 3-), chloride (Cl-) and sul phate (SO 42-) are commonly present 
in the wastewater from textile manufacture (Li, Dong et al. 2014) . The photo -Fenton catalytic 
degradation of dyes is affected  by the presence of inorganic ions in the solution. The co -existing 
anions can result in a decrease in the removal of dye, which has be en explained by considering 
the chemical reactions in the system due to their presence (Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018, Phan, 
Nikoloski et al. 2018) .  
2.6. Strategies to improve photo -Fent on catalytic activity of perovskites  
During the heterogeneous catalysis, metal  species  may leach from the catalyst s resulting in not 
only catalyst deactivation but also secondary pollution (Hartmann, Kullmann et al. 2010) . 
Therefore, the development of stable catalysts and reduction of metal s leaching into the treated 
solution is important.  Moreover, it is economically desirable to use photocatalysts that operate 
under visible light irradiation . It would be achieved by lowering the bandgap energy of the 
catalyst. Especially if  the recombination rate of the electron -hold pair over the perovskite s is 
reduced, its removal efficiency can be  improved. Various strategies for achieving these in 
AOPs have been extensively explored  (Soltani and Lee 2016, Lam, Sin et al. 2017, Soltani and 
Lee 2017, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018) . So far two main approaches have been commonly seen 
in the literatures relating to the improved removal of organic s via the photo -Fenton reaction by Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 perovskites : (1) doping with foreign metals in the A -site and/or the B -site and (2) varying the 
morphological properties of catalysts.  
2.6.1 Doping  
The A - and/or B -site cations of ABO 3 perovskites can be replaced by foreign cations having 
different radii or oxidation states without destroying the matrix structure (Voorhoeve, Remeika 
et al. 1976, Voorhoeve, Johnson et al. 1977, Pena and Fierro 2001) . For example, the oxi dation 
state of the B3+ cation can be raised to B4+ or an oxygen vacancy can be generated by the 
substitution of an A3+ cation with an A’2+ cation in the A3+1-xA’2+xBO 3 structure, as illustrated 
in Fig. 2.10. As can be seen from Fig. 2.10, an oxygen vacancy (denoted by a square) can be 
generated by losing one lattice oxygen. Molecular oxygen can be adsorbed and activated (by 
receiving electrons) in the oxygen vacancy and subsequently transformed into a chemically 
reactive oxygen species.  This implies that the oxygen vacancy can be a bridge for the 
transformation of molecular and lattice oxygen (Zhu, Li et al. 2014) .   
 
Fig. 2.10. Change in the oxidation state of B -site cation and the generation of oxygen vacancy 
in the defect A3+1−xA′2+xBO 3 structure  (Zhu, Li et al. 201 4). 
Doping by foreign elements at the A -site and/or B -site of ABO 3 perovskites is one of the 
effective ways to either reduce the electron -hole recombination (Soltani a nd Lee 2016)  or lower 
the band gap energy (Soltani and Lee 2017, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018) , which improves the 
photo -Fenton catalytic performance of the perovskite s. For example, the bandgap of BiFeO 3 
(BFO) was measured as 2.00 eV; whilst that of Ba -doped, Cu -doped an d Ba-Cu-co-doped BFO 
particles was found lower, as 1.98, 1.90, 1.87 eV, respectively. After 70 -min visible -light 
photo -Fenton reaction, almost complete removal of organic was seen with >65% TOC 
reduction by usin g Cu -doped an d Ba-Cu-co-doped BFO as the catalysts; this performance wa s 
much better than that when applying pure BFO or Ba -doped BFO  (Soltani and Lee 2017) .

 2.6.2 Morphology modification  
Controlling the shape and size of the crystal s is one way to improve the properties of materials 
(Mann and Ozin 1996, Tian, Voigt et al. 2003, El -Sayed 2004, Xiao, Han et al. 2004, Siegfried 
and Choi 2005, Zhang, Lv et al. 2011) , such as photocataly tic activity and performance  (Xu, 
Wang et al. 2006, Chen and Ye 2007, Liu, Chen et al. 2007, Li, Ouyang et al. 2012) . Phan et 
al. successfully synthesized LFO with different sizes and morphologies , such as nanospheres 
and microcubes by  varying the use of ion precursor, e.g. Fe(NO 3)3, C6H5FeO 7, Fe(C 5H7O2)3 or 
K3Fe(CN) 6, in the hydrothermal synthesis (Fig. 2.11) (Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018) . They found 
that the morphology had a strong influence on the photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of RhB . 
The sample  of LFO, which was hydrothermally synthesized with the use of Fe(NO 3)3 as iron 
precursor followed by the calcination at 800 °C, exhibited spherical shapes  with an average 
size of ~100 nm . It yielded superior  RhB degradation  (99.5%)  after the visible -light photo -
Fenton reaction , as compared to the use of other synthesized LFO samples which showed  larger 
particle sizes or/and non -spherical shapes  (Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018) .

photo -Fenton catalytic activity for RhB degradation  (temperature = 25 °C, initial dye 
concentration = 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 0.5 g L-1, initial H 2O2 concentration = 0.2 g L-1 
and initial pH = 5)  (Phan, Nikoloski et a l. 2018) . 
2.7. Summary and outlook  
In recent year, t he tremendous amount of research effort has been contributed to the 
development of various materials used in AOPs for  removal of organics in wastewater. In this 
Chapter 2                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 review , we focus ed on the  synthesis and utilization  of perovskite -based catalysts , especially 
LaFeO 3, for the photo -Fenton degradation of organic dyes . The structures and characteristics 
of perovskites  were reviewed , followed by the discussion on two main  synthetic methods , 
namely  hydrothermal and the sol -gel. The mechanism s governing photo -Fenton degradation of 
organic dyes were covered, which revealed that the  keys to enhancing photocatalytic 
performance of perovskite s are to reduce the band gap energy of catalysts and ease the 
recombination of electron -hole pairs  over materials . The research targeting on this for enhanced 
photo -Fenton performance  with the use of perovskites suggested some strategies , such as 
substituting a foreign element into the A -sites and/or B -sites of ABO 3 and modifying  their 
morpholog ical characteristics  (size and shape) . On the other size, process parameters, such as 
solution pH, catalyst dosage, dye concentration, selected light source and coexisting ions, need 
to be well adjusted for the optimal removal rate of pollutants in the photo -Fenton degradation .  
As seen in the literature , the perovskite -based photocatalysts are emerging as promising 
materials for visible -light-driven Fenton catalytic degradation of organic dyes . Although such 
strategies by doping foreign element into A -sites and/or B -sites of ABO 3 or tailoring ABO 3 
morphology have been investigated, still a limited amount of research touched the field of 
visible -light-driven Fenton catalytic degradation of  organics. It is important to further develop 
the understanding the photocatalytic activity of perovskite -based catalysts in the photo -Fenton 
reaction as well as its correlation to material structural, morphological and chemical properties . 
Although laboratory studies have shown good p erformance, their commercial application has  
several challenges including the difficulty of large -scale production and recycle -reuse. Future 
research could focus on improving the magnetic properties of the material and on the 
development of more efficient photocatalysts.

catalytic activity of rare earth orthoferrite ReFeO 3 (Re = La, Pr, Gd)

Screening of Re3+ cation influencing the photo -Fenton -like catalytic activity of rare earth 
orthoferrite ReFeO 3 (Re = La, Pr, Gd)

In preparation . 
3.1. Introduction  
The discharge of a considerable amount of dye -containing wastewater from various industries 
seriously poses a threat to aquatic life, human health and environment (Soon and Hameed 
2011) . Conventional techniques removing dye from wastewater, such as adsorption, 
coagulation , and filtration, are insufficient to achieve the current stringent requirements for 
discharge (Martínez -Huitle and Brillas 2009) . It is necessary to develop an effective wastewater 
treatment method to minimize the level of organic dye compounds. Recently, advanced 
oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged  as powerful approaches for removing persistent 
organic pollutants from wastewater  (Oturan and Aaron 2014, Bethi, Sonawane et al. 2016) . In 
particular, a photo -Fenton process using heterogeneous catalyst has been suggested for use in 
treating dye -containing wastewater due to its capacity for complete degradation and fast 
mineralization of dyes (Feng, Hu et al. 2003, Chen, Wu et al. 2009, Kim, Kan et al. 2015) .        
Perovskite -type oxides ABO 3 (A = rare -earth metal; B = transition metal) are one group of 
attractive materials applyi ng in heterogeneous -type catalysis because of their high thermal 
stability and catalytic activity (Zhu, Li et al. 2014, Grabowska 201 6). Rare -earth orthoferrites 
ReFeO 3 (Re = rare -earth element) have shown great potential in the fields of chemical sensor 
(Aono, Sato et al. 2001) , catalyst (Arakawa, Tsuchi -Ya et al. 1982) , anode material (Henao, 
Martinez -Gomez et al. 2017)  and solid oxide fuel cell (Qiu, Ichikawa et al. 2003) . They can 
also function as promising heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like catalysts for the degradation of 
organic pollutants under visible lig ht (Li, Zhang et al. 2014, Li and Wang 2016) . Li et al.  
reported that nanocrystalline GdFeO 3 could activate H 2O2 under visible light, improving the 
photodegradation rate of RhB by about 22 times as compared to that without the addition of Chapter 3                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 H2O2 (Hanifehpour, Soltani et al. 2016) . When dispersing 30 mg GdFeO 3 in 30 ml RhB 
solution 10-5 mol L-1 with 1 mL of 3% H 2O2, 89.9% of RhB was removed after 2 h exposure to 
visible light irradiation. Li et al.  investigated photo -Fenton -like photocatalytic activity of 
PrFeO 3 and YFeO 3 towards RhB degr adation under visible light (Li, Zhang et al. 2014) . Seen 
from the results, PrFeO 3 exhibited higher visible -light-excited photocatalytic activity than 
YFeO 3; 96% of RhB was degraded by using PrFeO 3 after 2 h whilst that for YFeO 3 was only 
25% (under the similar reaction conditions: 20 mg L-1 of the catalyst, 20 mL of 10-5 mol L-1 
RhB, 1 mL of 3% H 2O2) (Li, Zhang et al. 2014) . Obviously, the variation of Re -site atom in  
ReFeO 3 significantly affected its photocatalytic performance. However, there is limited 
research effort contributing to the study on the substitution of Re3+ cation in rare -earth 
orthoferrite and its photocatalytic activity (Niu, Li et al. 2005, Ding, Lü et al. 2010) .  
This work reported the preparation and characterization of ReFeO 3 (Re = La,  Pr, Gd) 
perovskite; as well as its use for the degradation of organic dye under visible light irradiation. 
RhB was selected as a model of dye as: (i) it is widely used in many industries; (ii) it causes 
harmful effects on humans and animals and (iii) it i s characterized by slow kinetic in 
conventional treatment processes (Lee, Park et al. 2013, Ahmad, Ahmed et al. 2014) . The effect 
of Re3+ ion variation in ReFeO 3 perovskite on the crystal structure, band gap energy , and 
photocatalytic performances was explored.  
3.2. Experimental  
3.2.1 Materials  
Lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO 3)3.6H 2O; 99.9%), praseodymium nitrate hexahydrate 
(Pr(NO 3)3.6H 2O; 99.9%), gadolinium nitrate hexahydrate (Gd(NO 3)3.6H 2O; 99.9%), iron 
nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O; 99.9%), citric acid (C 6H8O7.H2O; 99.9%), H 2O2 (30 
wt%), and Rhodamine B (RhB; 99.9%) were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich. Other chemicals 
were obt ained from Biolab Ltd in Australia, which were of analytical pure grade.   
3.2.2 Catalyst preparation  
In a typical hydrothermal synthesis of ReFeO 3 (Re = La, Pr, Gd), 5 mmol Re(NO 3)3.6H 2O and 
5 mmol Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized (DI) water. After adding 10 
mmol citric acid, the mixture was continuously stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The pH of 
the solution was adjusted to 9 with the use of a mmonia and sti rred for another 1 h. Afterward , 
the resulting synthetic solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon -lined autoclave and heated Chapter 3                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 at 180 °C for 20 h. The solids were separated by centrifugation, washed with DI water and 
ethanol, dried at 80 °C for 5 h and finally calcined at 800 °C for 6 h i n air. The resulting sample s 
of LaFeO 3, PrFeO 3, and GdFeO 3 were named as LFO, PFO and GFO, respectively.  
3.2.3 Catalyst characterization  
Surface morphologies of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss 
1555, VP -FESEM) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV with energy dispersive X -ray 
spectrometry (EDS) to determine the chemical composition of the catalysts. Transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using TEM -TITAN at an accelerating 
voltage of 200 kV. X -ray pow der diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in the 2 θ range of 
20° – 80° at a scanning rate of 1° min-1 using Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with CuK α 
radiation (28 mA, 35 kV). Nitrogen adsorption -desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K 
using SAPA201 0 (Micromeritics Inc). X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were 
taken on Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Perkin -Elmer). The 
binding energy was calibrated with reference to the C 1s level of carbon at 284.6 eV. UV -Vis 
absorpt ion spectra of the samples were measured by Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR 
spectrophotometer using BaSO 4 as a reference. The bandgap values were obtained from the 
interception of a linear fitted to the low -energy side in a plot of [F(R ∞)hν]2 versus  hν, where h ν 
is the energy of the incident photon and F(R) is the Kubelka Munk function (Bellakki, Kelly et 
al. 2010) . 
3.2.4 Photocatalytic activity test 
Photocatalytic activity of the sample was tested by adding 100 mg catalyst into 100 mL of 10 
mg L-1 RhB aqueous solution in a cylindrical Pyrex vessel (300 mL), which was surrounded 
by a circulating water jacket to maintain solution temperature at 25 °C. A  photo -Fenton -like 
reaction was initiated by introducing 10 mM H 2O2 to the suspension. A Xenon lamp (CEL -HX 
F300) was used with a 400 nm cut -off filter to provide visible light for photocatalytic 
degradation test. Before light irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark 
for 30 minutes to reach an adso rption -desorption equilibrium of RhB onto the catalyst. 
Subsequently, the suspension was exposed to visible light for 90 min. 4 mL of the sample was 
taken from the suspension every 15 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm; the obtained 
supernatant was tested u sing Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis spectrometer to confirm the 
concentration of RhB.  The concentration of RhB in the thesis was calculated by the mean of 
duplicate experiments and the error of measurement  was within 5%.  Chapter 3                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 3.3 Results and discussion  
3.3.1 Catalyst characterization  
3.3.1.1 Phase structure  
The XRD patterns of rare -earth orthoferrites, shown in Fig. 3.1, depict that all the obtained 
samples were pure phase and crystallized in orthorhombic structures, which are in agreement 
with the JCPDS cards of LaFeO 3 (No. 37 -1493) (Chandradass and Kim 2010) , PrFeO 3 (PDF 
No. 78 -2424) (Qin, Li et al. 2015)   and GdFeO 3 (JCPDS No. 47 -0067) (Ding, Lü et al. 2010) . 
Table 3.1 shows the cell volumes and lattice parameters of LFO, PFO and GFO, and tolerance 
factor calculations. As can be seen form Table 3.1 the lattice parameters of resulting ReFeO 3 
changed gradu ally from LaFeO 3, PrFeO 3 to GdFeO 3. Yuan et al.  reported that the degree of 
FeO 6 octahedron distortion in ReFeO 3 caused by the difference in lattice parameters (Yuan, 
Huang et al. 2016) . On the other side, the relativ e distortion of ReFeO 3 perovskites might be 
explained based on the tolerance factor (t), defined as t = (r A + rO)/√2(rB + rO), where r A, rB, and 
rO are the respective ionic radii  (Eitel, Randall et al. 2001) . The tolerance factors herein were 
found t o decrease from LFO, PFO to GFO with decreasing ionic radius of Re -site in ReFeO 3 
with the decreasing in the ionic radii of Re -site atoms (La3+ (1.16Å) > Pd3+ (1.13Å) > Gd3+ 
(1.05Å) (Li, Xue et al. 2006) ), as shown in Table 3.1. This is in good agreement with the 
previous study (Berenov, Angeles et al. 2008) . Such structur al distortion would greatly impact 
on the physicochemical and photocatalytic properties of the material (Zhang, Liu et al. 2016) , 
which were further explored in detail in the next section.

3.3.1.2 Morphological analysis  
Fig. 3.2 shows the SEM images of GFO, PFO and LFO samples. All these samples show the 
spherical -like particles with agglomeration. Seen from Fig. 3.2a and 3.2b, we found small 
particles  (highlighted  in red circle s in Fig. 3.3)  accumulated on to the surfaces of GF O and 
PFO.  This interesting finding could be attributed to the dissolution -recry stallization process 
during hydrothermal treatment (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2012) . Fig. 3.2d shows the 
elemental composition of the s amples surface s determined by EDX. The results revealed the 
presence of only Re (Re = Gd or Pr or La), Fe and O in the corresponding GFO, PFO , and 
LFO, with a Re/Fe/O molar ration of approximately 1/1/3, which is consistent with the 
stoichiometric composit ions of compounds.

3.3.1.3 Optical property  
The light absorption capability of ReFeO 3 was analyz ed via the UV -vis absorption data, and 
the results are shown in Fig. 3.4. The light absorption spectra exhibit the absorption bands in 
the visible region (400 – 800 nm), implying that those samples should be effective as visible  
light photocatalysts. The band gap was estimated to be 2.20, 2.17 and 2.10 eV for GFO, PFO , 
and LFO , respectively . Among these catalysts, LFO has  the lowest  band gap energy, suggesting 
its sup erior visible light absorption capability.  The smaller band gap of LFO compared to PFO 
and GFO could  be explained as follows. In ReFeO 3 perovskite, the band gap value depends on 
the bonding in  the corner -sharing FeO 6 octahedron network (Mizoguchi, Eng et al. 2004) . The 
Fe-O-Fe bond angles decrease as a result of the decreased ionic radii (Zhao, Ren et al. 2013) , 
which leads to the expand of Fe -centered octahedral in ReFeO 3 samples, following order: LFO 
> PFO > GFO (Tab le 3.1). This decreased the antibonding Fe -O interaction and thus lowered 
the energy of the conduction band and band gap energy (Mizoguchi, Eng et al. 2004) .

 3.3.1.4 BET analysis  
The adsorption -desorption isotherms curves of GFO, PFO and LFO catalysts were illustrated 
in Fig.  3.5. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter calculated from the 
isotherm data were listed in Table 3.2. All the samples show type IV isotherm with H3 
hysteresis loop (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2014) . As can be seen from Fig. 3.5, the hysteresis 
loops of t he samples appeared in the high -pressure range (0.9 < P/P 0 < 1) can be associated to 
the interstitial holes formed between particles due to aggregation (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 
2013) . As is well known, t he photoreaction usually occurs on t he surface of a photocatalyst 
that needs good contact between the photocatalyst’s surface and the substrate; thus material 
with small crystallite size and high specific surface area may enhance photocatalytic activity 
(Li, Jing et al. 2007) . The PFO and GFO perovskites had slightly smaller specific surface areas 
than that of LFO. This might be due to the formation of small particle onto their surface, as 
shown in SEM images. LFO possessed the highest specific surface area (17.63 m2/g), which  is 
favorable for high photocatalytic activity.

3.3.1.5 Compositional analysis  
The XPS spectra for GFO, PFO and LFO samples were measured and presented in Fig. 3.6. 
The binding energy of Gd 3d 5/2 and Gd 3d 3/2 was observed at 1185.4 eV and 1217.8 eV (Fig.  
3.6a), suggesting the oxide form of the Gd3+ (Söderlind, Selegård et al. 2009) . Fig. 3.6b shows 
a doublet located at 931.7 eV and 951.7 eV corresponding to the core lines of Pr 3d 5/2 and Pr 
3d3/2 of Pr3+ (Pandey, Bindu et al. 2005) . As seen in Fig. 3.6c, two strong peaks of La 3d 5/2 and 
La 3d 3/2 situated at 833.2 eV and 849.9 eV , respectively, which corresponds to the core level 
spectr a of La3+ ions in their oxide form (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2012) . There is no much 
difference in the peak position of Fe 2p for all three samples (Fig. 3.6d-f). The two strong peaks 
of Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 were located at 710.5 eV and  723.8 eV, respectively, which could be 
assigned to the +3 oxidation state of Fe in the samples (Thirum alairajan, Girija et al. 2012) . 
The main O form was O2- in all samples, as indicated by the O1s spectra corresponds to crystal 
lattice oxygen O L (peaks situated at 529.1 eV) and hydroxyl oxygen O H (peaks situated at 531 
eV) (Parida, Reddy et al. 2010) . The XPS results of three samples ag ree with the above XRD 
and EDS results.

3.3.2 Catalytic activity  
The photocatalytic activities of ReFeO 3 were  examined by the degradation of RhB under 
visible light (λ >  400 nm). The temporal photodegradation curves of RhB over the ReFeO 3 
catalysts were shown in Fig. 3.7(a-c). In general, the photoreaction occurs onto the catalyst 
surface; therefore, the adsorption capability of the catalyst is expected to be one of the key 
factors affecting photocatalytic efficiency. We carried out the experiment studying the 
capability of ReFeO 3 samples to adsorb RhB in the dark. The results did not reveal meaningful 
evidence of RhB adsorption onto the surface of these catalysts. As a c omparison, the 
degradation of RhB in the absence of photocatalysts was also conducted, and the results 
illustrate that RhB hardly degrade s either under visible light irradiation or in the presence of 
H2O2. However, under the simultaneous presence of cataly st and H 2O2, the RhB degradation 
rate was a little improved even in the dark. The removal rate s of RhB for GFO, PFO , and LFO 
were 8.5, 9.3 and 10.4 % , respectively,  after 90 min in the dark condition.  
As can be seen clearly from Fig. 3.7 that when the vis ible light was applied and in the presence 
of H 2O2, the photocatalytic activity of LFO for RhB degradation reached 98.2%, which was 
higher than that of PFO (81.5%) and GFO (74.6%). This suggests that ReFeO 3 perovskites be 
of potential as catalysts in heter ogeneous Fenton process. The time -dependent

 photodegradation of RhB as monitored by the maximal absorption band of RhB at 554 nm over 
the LFO catalyst was presented in Fig. 3.7d. As irradiation time increased the maximum 
absorption of RhB at λ = 554 nm ste adily decreased. Irradiation time after 75 min did not 
impact any further apparent decrease in the maximum absorption of the solution. This implies 
that RhB was degraded under visible light illumination following the de -ethylation process of 
RhB (Tian, Tu et al. 2011) . 
 
Fig. 3.7. The photocatalytic degradation of RhB by (a) GFO, (b) PFO, (c) LFO catalysts under 
the same conditions (catalyst dosage = 1g L-1; H2O2 concentration = 10 mM; RhB concentration 
= 10 mg L-1; pH = 5) and (d) the temporal change in adsorption spectra of RhB s olution in the 
simultaneous presence of LFO and H 2O2 under visible light irradiation.  
Obviously, the photocatalytic performances of these catalysts were different, following the 
order GFO < PFO < LFO. The excellent photocatalytic activities of LFO compared  to other 
rare-earth orthoferrites could be attributed to the following reasons. First of all, the crystal 
structure of catalyst was modified as substitution of Re -site atom with different ionic radius.  
When La was substituted by the atoms with a smaller ionic radius, e.g. , Pr or Gd, the crystal 
structure of ReFeO 3 became less distorted. It has been reported that the perovskite materials 
possessing a higher degree of structural distortion exhibited higher photocatalytic efficiency 
(Thirumalairaja n, Girija et al. 2013) . This is due to such structural distortions may act as the 
holes trapping center s, which were effective for the reduction of recombination rate between

 electrons and holes; thus enhanced photocatalytic activity (Thirumalairajan, Gir ija et al. 2013, 
Chen and Umezawa 2014) . A similar observation was also reported by Ding et al.  (Ding, Lü 
et al. 2010) .  
Secondly, it is believed that the photocatalytic activity of perovskite -based c atalysts is related 
to its band gap energy (Huang, Wei et al. 2010) . The dye degradation process over orthoferr ite 
photocatalysts under visible light irradiation is governed by light absorption capability.  The 
material with smaller band gap energy is more beneficial for harvesting more photons to 
generate more electrons and holes taking part in the photoreaction, le ading to greater 
photodegradation efficiency (Huang, Wei et al. 2010) . Our band gap energy calculations of 
ReFeO 3 perov skites strongly supported this. LFO has narrower band gap value than PFO and 
GFO. T hus LFO showed the highest photocatalytic activity towards RhB degradation under 
visible light irradiation.  
Specific surface area also imparted a great influence on photocata lytic activity. The 
photodegradation of RhB occurs onto the photocatalyst’s surface which needs a good contact 
between the dye and the catalyst’s surface. Therefore, under visible light irradiation, a 
photocatalyst with a higher specific surface area not o nly offers more active sites for 
photoreaction but also allows more surfaces  reaching to the light source, leading to the 
improved photocatalytic efficiency (Zhang, Shao et al. 2012) . As shown in Table 3.2, although 
all samples exhibited similar BET specific surface area , that of  LFO was slightly greatest and 
therefore further supports its high  photodegradation activity.  
3.4 Conclusions  
We synthesized a series of ReFeO 3 perovskite photocatalysts (Re = La, Pr, Gd) by t he facile 
hydrothermal method and investigated their photo -Fenton -like catalytic activity for RhB 
degradation under visible light irradiation. The variation of Re -site atom in ReFeO 3 perovskites 
not only caused a slight distortion of crystal structure bu t also had an influence on band gap 
energy; thus affected the photocatalytic activity. The activity of ReFeO 3 catalyst increased with 
the decrease of Re3+ ionic radius, which was attributed to the larger structural distortion, 
narrower band gap energy , and lar ger specific surface area. The photocatalytic performances 
were in the following order LaFeO 3 > PrFeO 3 > GdFeO 3. Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

4.1 Introduction  
Dyes and pigments are a group of most common contaminants found in the wastewater coming  
from many industries such as textiles, plastics, printing, cosmetics and rubber (Chiou, Ho et al. 
2004) . Approximately 30, 000 – 150, 000 tons of dyes are discharged into waterways annually 
(Vanhulle, Trovaslet et al. 2007) , which pose potential threats to human as well as aquatic 
environment. Most of the dyes can persist in the aquatic systems for a long period of time due 
to their resistance to bacterial and chemical attacks (Li, Dai et al. 2009) . Their presence in wa ter 
not only affects water colo r and transparency, but also produces mutagenic and carcinogenic 
organic compounds (Ulson, Bonilla et al. 2010) . Rhodamine B (RhB), as one of  N-containing 
dyes, ha s been extensively used to colo r the final product in the textile and food industries. It 
can undergo reductive anaerobic decomposition to produce potentially carcinogenic aromatic 
amines (Fu, Pan et al. 2005) . Therefore, the development of efficient method to remove such 
compound from industrial effluent is of utmost importance.  
Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2) reaction, as an advanced oxidation process (AOP), ap pears to efficiently 
degrade recalcitrant organic compounds in wastewater. Although the Fenton reaction has been 
studied for more than a century, its mechanism is still under discussion. It is normally accepted 
that the strong oxidants, such as hydroxyl ra dicals (•OH) with oxidation potential of 2.8 eV (as 
follows), are generated to degrade organic contaminants in water (Babuponnusami and 
Muthukumar 2014) .  
Fe2+ + H 2O2 → Fe3+ + •OH + OH- (4.1) 
 Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 However, there are some disadvantages when using ferrous ion as the homogeneous catalyst 
in the Fenton process, including narrow working pH range (pH ˂ 4), generation of iron oxide 
sludge and difficulty in its removal (Wang, Zhao et al. 2014, Hassan, Chen et al. 2016) . 
Therefore, its complexity motivated extensive research in developing solid -state heterogeneous 
Fenton -like catalysts, e.g. , iron containing zeolites (Kasiri, Aleboyeh et al. 2008) , clay -based 
Fe nanocomposites (Feng, Hu et al. 2006)  and modified iron oxides (Rahim Pouran, Abdul 
Raman et al. 2014) . The use of UV light irradiation could further accelerate the Fenton process; 
such usually referred as the photo -Fenton reaction (Kasiri, Aleboyeh et al. 2008) . The 
degradation efficiency of organics can be significantly enhanced in the photo -Fenton system 
compared with that in the Fenton system. However, the UV light only corresponds to 3 – 5% 
of incident solar light (Seery, George et al. 2007, Chen, Cen et al. 2016) . Moreover, the use of 
artificial light sources in industry requires specific equipmen t and high energy consumption. 
Some studies have suggested that the adoption of visible light instead of UV make the photo -
Fenton process to be more economical (Chen, Xie et al. 2001, Pérez, Torrades et al. 2002) . 
Hence, a heterogeneous catalyst, which possesses high catalytic activity in visible -light-excited 
photo -Fenton process, is much desirable. Meanwh ile, other features of the catalyst, such as 
stability, reusability and low cost, should not be neglected (Hartmann, Kullmann et al. 2010) . 
In recent years, sev eral Fe -containing rare earth metal oxides have been proven for use as the 
heterogeneous photo -Fenton catalysts (Ju, Chen et al. 2011, Li, Zhang et al. 2014, Rusevova, 
Köferstein et al. 2014, Wang, Niu et al. 2017) . In particular, as a member of ABO 3 perovskite 
family, LaFeO 3 (LFO) shows advantageous features. For example, LFO, with a good stability 
in liquid phase, can be photoexcited under visible light irradiation due to its low band gap 
energy. Among different rare earth elements, lanthanum (La) is  the abundant natural element 
and thus considered as a cost -effective catalyst component. Several synthetic methods have 
been reported to prepare ABO 3, including sol -gel method (Rusevova, Köferstein et al. 2014, 
Wang, Zhang et al. 2018) , self -combustion (Faye, Guélou et al. 2009) , hydrothermal synthesis 
(Sardar, Lees et al. 2010) , microwave -assisted method (Ding, Lü et al. 2010)  and co -
precipitation (Ito, Tezuka et al. 2001) ; in which the hydrothermal method is promising because 
of low temperature, cost effectiveness and process simplicity. So far, only a few reports have 
been available on the synthesis of ABO 3 via hydrothermal method and its application in the 
photo -Fenton -like reaction targeting at organic degradation. For example, Zhou et al.  have 
successfully synthesized BiFeO 3 cylindrical -like parti cles by using hydrothermal reaction; the 
synergistic effect of catalyst and H 2O2 significantly influenced the photocatalytic efficiency Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 due to the enhancement of photoexcitat ion and acceleration of charge transfer (Zhou, Li et al. 
2016 ). Their results showed that about 94% of RhB in 80 mL of 1×10-5 M solution was 
degraded within 3 h in the presence of 1 mL H 2O2 and 0.08 g catalyst under visible light 
irradiation. The cubic BiFeO 3 particles, which were hydrothermally synthesized by Xu and co -
workers, could effectively degrade tetracycline (Xue, Wan g et al. 2015) . The removal 
efficiency of tetracycline reached almost 80% after 2 h exposure to visible light under the initial 
reaction conditions of 0.5 mM H 2O2, 0.5 g L-1 catalyst and 10 mg L-1 tetracycline (pH = 8). 
However, to the best of our knowl edge, no study has been performed on the application of 
LFO, synthesized via hydrothermal method, as heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like catalyst for 
organic degradation; which was the objective of this study. It has been reported that the 
photocatalytic activ ity of a catalyst is significantly affected by a number of factors, including 
crystallinity, morphology, size and optical property, which can be tuned by varying synthetic 
solution compositions and reaction conditions. Herein, we studied the effects of iro n precursor, 
synthetic solution pH and calcination temperature on the structural, morphological and optical 
properties of hydrothermally synthesized LFO. The photo -Fenton -like catalytic capacity of our 
as-prepared LFO was evaluated towards the degradation of RhB, which was selected as the 
organic model, under visible light. It was then optimized in terms of catalyst loading, initial 
solution pH and initial H 2O2 dosage. Based on the experimental results, a possible photo -
Fenton catalytic mechanism was also proposed.  
4.2. Experimental  
4.2.1 Material  
Lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO 3)3.6H 2O; 99.9%), iron (III) citrate (C 6H5FeO 7; 
bioreagent), iron (III) acetylacetonate (Fe(C 5H7O2)3; 97%) and citric acid (C 6H8O7.H2O; 
≥99.5%), 5,5-dimethyl -1-pyrroline -N-oxide (DMPO; ≥97%) and Rhodamine B (RhB; ≥95%) 
were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich. Iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O; 98 – 101% ) 
was the product from Alta Aesar. Potassium ferricyanide (K 3Fe(CN) 6; AR grade)  was obtained 
from Ajax finechem Pty. Ltd, AU. Other chemicals were obtained from Biolab Ltd in Australia.   
4.2.2 Synthesis and characterization of LFO  
In the hydrothermal syn thesis of LaFeO 3 (LFO), typically, 5 mmol La(NO 3)3.6H 2O and 5 mmol 
Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized (DI) water. After adding 10 mmol citric 
acid, the mixture was continuously stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The pH of solution was 
adjusted to 9 with the use of a mmonia and sti rred for another 1 h. Afterward , the resulting Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 synthetic solution was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon -lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 
20 h. The solids were separated by centrifugation, washed with DI water and ethanol, dried at 
80 °C for 5 h and finally calcined at 800 °C for 6 h in air (heating rate of 5 °C min-1). The 
resulting sample was named as LFO -N800.  
The samples, which were calcined at 600 °C, 700 °C and 900 °C, were denoted as LFO -N600, 
LFO-N700 a nd LFO -N900, respectively. LFO -NA was referred to the sample which was 
prepared following the above procedures, but without the adjustment of solution pH using 
ammonia and at 800 °C calcination. The pH of synthetic solution was measured as 2. In 
addition t o iron (III) nitrate (Fe(NO 3)3), iron (III) citrate (C 6H5FeO 7), iron (III) acetylacetonate 
(Fe(C 5H7O2)3) and potassium ferricyanide (K 3Fe(CN) 6), was selected as iron source to prepare 
synthetic solution. After hydrothermal synthesis and calcination at 800 °C, the obtained 
samples were named as LFO -C, LFO -A and LFO -P, correspondingly.  
Surface morphologies of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss 
1555, VP -FESEM) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV with point resolution of 1.7 nm at 5 kV; 
which is equipped with energy dispersive X -ray spectra (EDX) with detection limits of 0.1 
wt%. X -ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in the 2 θ range of 20° – 80° at a 
scanning rate of 1° min-1 using GBC eMMA X -ray diffractometer with CuK α radiation (28 
mA, 35 kV). The limits for quanlitative pattern matching are about 5 -10%. The thermal 
characteristics of samples from room temperature to 900 °C  were determined by 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Perkin Elmer 
Pyris -1 DSC TGA -7 thermal  analyser) by flowing 100 mL min-1 nitrogen at a heating rate of 
10 °C min-1. Nitrogen adsorption -desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using 
SAPA2010 (Micromeritics Tristar II Inc). The instrument is limit ed to the pores in the size 
range from 2 nm to 300 nm, and sample dimensions of < 4 mm. Prior to analysis, the samples 
were degassed at 200 oC for 12 h under vacuum. UV -Vis absorption spectra of the samples 
were measured by Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis/N IR spectrophotometer mounted with a 
60 mm integrating sphere and using BaSO 4 as a reference. The UV/Vis resolution is in the 
range of 0.17 nm to 5 nm and stray light at 220 nm (10 g L-1 NaI ASTM method) is below 
0.0001% T. The band gap values were obtained from the interception of a linear fitted to the 
low-energy side in a plot of [F(R)  hʋ]2 versus  hʋ (hʋ: the energy of the incident photon; F(R): 
the Kubelka Munk function); F(R), is was calculated based on

 in which R is reflectance (Barrocas, Sério et al. 2016) .   
4.2.3 Photocatalytic degradation and mechanism study  
Photocatalytic activity of the sample was tested by adding 100 mg LFO into 100 mL of 10 mg 
L-1 RhB aqueous solution in a cylindrical Pyrex vessel, which was surrounded by a circulating 
water jacket to maintain solution temperature at ambient temperature. A photo -Fenton -like 
reaction was initiated by introducing 1 mL H 2O2 to the suspension. A Xenon lamp (CEL -HX 
F300) was used with a 400 nm cut -off filter to provide visible light for photocatalytic 
degradation test. In all the photodegradation tests, the illuminated area of solution was 24 cm2 
and the intensity of illumination, determined by TES  132-Solar power meter, was be 1734 
W/m2. Before light irradiation, the suspension was magnetically stirred in dark for 30 minutes 
to reach an adsorption -desorption equilibrium of RhB onto LFO. Subsequently, the suspension 
was exposed to visible light for 90 min. 4 mL of the sample was taken from the suspension 
every 15 min and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm; the obtained supernatant was tested using Perkin 
Elmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis spectrometer to confirm the concentration of RhB. The 
photocatalytic degradation %  was calcul ated using formula given below:  
𝐷𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  (%)=(1−𝐶𝑡
𝐶𝐿)×100%                                                                              (4.3)  
where C L and C t are the RhB concentration s before degradation and during degradation at a 
given period of time, respectively.  
In the photodegradation test, the RhB concentration was 10 mg L-1, which has been commonly 
used in the photodegradation test over heterogeneous catalysts (Zhu, Hang et al. 2011, Qi and 
Li 2014, Guo, Zhang et al. 2015) . Othe r experimental conditions selected herein, such as 
catalyst loading and H 2O2 dosage, were also selected based on the literature (Zhu, Hang et al. 
2011, Qi and Li 2014, Guo, Zhang et al. 2015) . Sinc e the pH of azo dye -containing wastewater 
from textile effluent ranges from natural to slightly acidic pH (Arslan -Alaton, Tureli et al. 
2009) , we focused on the pH range of 4 – 8 for study.  
To test the recyclability of LFO, repetitive degradation test was performed using LFO -N800 
as the catalyst. After photocatalytic degradation, the La and Fe contents in the suspension were 
monitored by using Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometry (I CP-MS, 
PerkinElmer’s NexION 350). The detection limit of ICP -MS for La concentration is below 
0.01 ppb and for Fe concentration is around 0.05 ppb.  Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 For electron spin resonance (ESR) assay, different conditions, including LFO/H 2O2/light (the 
RhB solution wi th LFO -N800 and H 2O2 under light illumination), LFO/H 2O2/dark (the RhB 
solution with LFO -N800 and H 2O2 in dark), LFO/light (the RhB solution with LFO -N800 
under light illumination) and LFO/dark (the RhB solution with LFO -N800 in dark) were 
selected for stu dy. Within 2 minutes from the start of experiment, 100 µL of the RhB solution 
was collected from the suspension, and immediately mixed with 20 µL of 0.2 mol L-1 DMPO 
to form DMPO -•OH adduct. The ESR spectra were obtained on a Bruker ESR 300E with 
microwave  bridge (receiver gain: 40 dB; modulation amplitude: 1 Gauss; microwave power: 
2.10-4 mW; modulation frequency: 100 kHz).  
4.3. Results and discussion  
4.3.1 Hydrothermal synthesis of LFO  
4.3.1.1 Effect of Iron precursor  
To study the impact of iron precursor  on the morphology, structure and activity of resulting 
photocatalyst, herein we selected Fe(NO 3)3, Fe(C 5H7O2)3, C 6H5FeO 7, and K 3Fe(CN) 6 in the 
hydrothermal synthesis of LFO. The XRD patterns of LFO -N800, LFO -C, LFO -A, and LFO -
P (Fig.  4.1a) showed the char acteristic peaks of orthorhombic structure of LFO 
(Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2013, Pei, Du et al. 2015) . The EDX results (Table 4.1) exhibited 
the molar ratio of lanthanum, iron and oxygen elements as 1/1/3, which is consistent with the 
stoichiometric composition of LFO. The sharper and narrower diffraction peaks arising from 
the XRD pattern of LFO -N800, which wa s synthesized in the presence of Fe(NO 3)3, suggest 
relatively higher crystallinity, as compared with the samples synthesized with other iron 
precursors.   
In Fig. 4.1b, the particles in the three samples, which were prepared with the use of Fe(NO 3)3, 
Fe(C 5H7O2)3, and C 6H5FeO 7, agglomerated and showed spherical -like shapes; the average size 
of particles in LFO -N800 was slightly smaller than that of LFO -C and LFO -A (~ 100 nm). 
Porous cubic -like particles were observed in LFO -P (Fig. 4.1b) with an average size  of 
approximately 4 µm, which distinguish from the spheres in the other three samples. In 
comparison with the relatively high BET surface area of LFO -N800 (17.63 m2 g-1), LFO -C 
(17.10 m2 g-1) and LFO -A (16.85 m2 g-1), the small surface area (7.63 m2 g-1) can be resulted 
from the large size of cubic particles in LFO -P.  Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 In the synthesis of LFO when using Fe(NO 3)3 as iron precursor, the following reactions (Eq s. 
(4.4) – (4.8)) were suggested being involved (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2012, Kumar and 
Jayavel 2014) . Citric acid was used in such hydrothermal synthesis as chelating agent, adjusting 
and controlling the nucleation, crystallizat ion and growth of materials (Di, Willinger et al. 
2008, Cho, Jang et al. 2009) .  
La(NO 3)3 → La3+ + 3NO 3- (4.4) 
Fe(NO 3)3 → Fe3+ + 3OH- → Fe(OH) 3 (4.5) 
La3+ + C 6O7H8 → [C 6O7H5]3-La3+ + 3H+ (4.6) 
[C6O7H5]3-La3+ + 3OH- → La(OH) 3 + [C 6O7H5]3- (4.7) 
La(OH) 3 + Fe(OH) 3 → LaFeO 3 + 3H 2O (4.8) 
Typically, La3+, which was dissociated from La(NO 3)3 (Eq. (4.4)), was easier to be chelated by 
citric acid, due to the greater stability of product, as compared with Fe3+ from Fe(NO 3)3 (Eq. 
(4.5)). During chelation, H+ was released from citric acid to the synthetic solution (Eq. (4.6)). 
Afterward, in hydrothermal reaction, La3+ was slowly liberated from citrate – La complex and 
combined with OH- in solution to form La(OH) 3 via alcoholysis (Eq. (4.7)). The simultaneously 
formed Fe(OH) 3 could react with La(OH) 3 to produce LFO precipitate  after condensation (Eq. 
(4.8)). During the synthesis, citric acid plays an important role in altering growth rate of crystals 
and affecting morphology of final product. The replacement of Fe(NO 3)3 with other iron 
precursors, such as Fe(C 5H7O2)3, C 6H5FeO 7 or K 3Fe(CN) 6, may more or less affect the 
complexation between citrate and metal ions. It would also influence the formation of Fe(OH) 3 
(Eq. (4.5)), thereby moderate Fe(OH) 3 – La(OH) 3 condensation (Eq. (4.8)) when forming LFO 
nuclei and vary subsequent crystal growth (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2012) . This induced 
the formation of the resulting LFO with varying morphology and size when changing the use 
of iron precu rsors. 
As is known, the feature of energy band structure is normally considered as a key evaluator for 
photocatalytic activity of a material. Fig. 4.2a show s the UV -vis absorption spectra of the four 
samples. As can be seen clearly, four samples synthesized from different iron precursors 
exhibited similar optical absorption abilities. The absorption spectra illustrated a strong 
absorption in UV region (at aro und 320 nm) and over visible light to near IR region (400 nm – 
800 nm ). In the inset of Fig. 4.2a, the band gap values of LFO samples were estimated to be Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

respectively ; suggesting theirs suitability for photocatalytic decomposition of organic  via 
activation by visible light irradiation.

Based on Fig. 4.2b, there was a negligible amount of RhB (˂ 10%) adsorbed by the LFO 
samples before applying visible light illumination. The amount of RhB adsorption on LFO -P 
was hi ghest, reaching 7%; whereas only ~1% of RhB in solution was removed by LFO -N800

 via adsorption. The photocatalytic activity of LFO strongly depended on the type of iron 
precursor selected in the hydrothermal reaction; which was in the order of LFO -N800 >  LFO-
A > LFO -C > LFO -P. The LFO -N800 sample showed the highest rate of degradation in the 
first 15 min and the  highest catalytic activity with 99.5% of RhB removed after 90 min 
exposure to visible light. This superior performance to those of other LFO samp les is believed 
to be correlated to its structural, morphological and optical properties. For example, LFO -
N800, showing suitable band gap energy, can harvest  photons to take part in the photoreaction 
for photocatalytic performance (Tang, Tong et al. 2013) . Its high crystallinity and small particle 
size are beneficial chara cteristics to suppress the recombination of photoexcited electrons and 
holes, both of which easily migrate to the surface of catalyst (Wei, Xu et al. 2008) . The particles 
with small size generally offer large specific surface area and thus a greater amount of available 
active sites for photo -Fenton catalytic degradation.  
4.3.1.2 Effect of synthetic solution pH  
The pH of synthetic solution was adjusted from  2 to 9 by adding a mmonium hydroxide ; and in 
turn affected the crystallinity, morphology, particles size, optical property and subsequently 
photocatalytic activity of resulting LFO.

LFO (temperature = 25°C, initial dye concentration = 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 0.5 g L-1, 
initial H 2O2 concentration = 0.2 g L-1 and initial pH = 5).   
The XRD patterns of LFO -NA and LFO -N800 were examined, as shown in Fig. 4.3a. No 
noticeable changes in crystallographic patterns were observed, which was further supported by 
the EDX results (Table 4.1). However, the characteristic peaks became sharper and narrower 
as increasing the solution pH from 2 to 9 (Fig. 4.3a). Further S EM observation (Fig. 4.3b) 
indicated that the particle size of LFO was significantly dependent on the pH of synthetic 
solution. Obviously, the particle size of LFO -NA (5 µm – 15 µm), which was synthesized at 
pH = 2, was much larger than that of LFO -N800 (3 0 nm – 70 nm), which was prepared with 
pH = 9. Especially, in the high magnification SEM image of LFO -NA (Fig. 4.3b), a porous 
structure was seen inside the broken large particles, which were caused by agglomeration of 
particles with sizes of ~ 30 nm – 50 nm. This could explain the comparable BET specific 
surface area of LFO -NA (20.07 m2/g) to that of LFO -N800 (17.63 m2/g) (Table 4.1), although 
the mean particle size in it was much larger.  
The difference in morphology and size of particles in both samples might be explained by the 
change of synthetic solution pH, which varied the complexation between citrate and metal ions. 
As can be seen above (E qs. (4.4) – (4.8)), the synthetic solution prepared at pH = 9 might 
remarkably facilitate chelation, thus increasing nucleation rate, controlling crystallite growth 
and decreasing particle size (Kumar and Jayavel 2014) . At low pH condition (e.g. , pH = 2), the 
complexation between citrate and metal ions would be reduced; even the decomplexation 
occurred. Few nanoparticles might be formed and act as cores that promoted growth of LF O

 microspheres. During experiment, we observed that both the precursor solutions were clear at 
pH = 2 and 9; whilst white precipitation was observed to occur in the pH range of 4 – 8. When 
increasing synthetic pH from 2 to 9, the color of solution was chan ged from light red to deep 
red. This further suggests a difference in the complexation between citrate and metal ions (Xu, 
Huang et al. 2004) , which could affect the formation of LFO and subsequently its morphology.  
Fig. 4.4a shows the UV -Vis absorption spectra of LFO -N800 and LFO -NA with absorption at 
320 nm and a broad absorption peak in visible reg ion (400 nm – 800 nm). The band gap energ ies 
for LFO -N800 and LFO -NA w ere 2.34 eV and 2.11 eV, respectivel y. Despite slightly larger 
band gap energy observed, LFO -N800 exhibited greater photocatalytic activity (99.5% of RhB 
removal rate in 90 min) as compared with that of LFO -NA (~ 80% of RhB removal rate in 90 
min) (Fig. 4.4b).  
4.3.1.3 Effect of calcination temperature  
Phase composition an d crystal structure of the LFO samples calcined at different temperatures 
were examined in Fig. 4.5.

comparison.   
As shown in Fig. 4.5a, the LFO precursor before calcination was characterised as t he

 characteristic peaks of LFO, signifying the transformation of amorphous phase to crystalline 
LFO (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2014) . No characteristic peaks of impurities were detected, 
confirming high puri ty of the samples. This was further evidenced in the EDX analysis (Table 
4.1). The intensity of characteristic LFO peaks increase by elevating calcination temperature. 
The sharp and narrow diffraction peaks were observed for LFO -N900, suggesting high 
cryst allinity. Based on the (121) peak using the Scherrer formula (Wang, Zhu et al. 2006) , the 
average crystallit e size s  of LFO -N600, LFO -N700, LFO -N800 and LFO -N900 were  calculated 
to be 17.9 nm, 25.9 nm, 28.0 nm and 35.8 nm, respectively.

Agglomerated LFO particles were observed in the samples of LFO -N600 and LFO -N700 (Fig. 
4.5b). The particles of LFO -N800 exhibited agglomerated spherical morphology with a 
diameter of approximately 30 nm – 70 nm. The further increase of calcination temperature, i.e. 
900 °C, caused recrystallization and formation of bigger particles (150 nm – 200 nm) (Fig. 
4.5b). The BET specific surface area s of LFO -N600, LFO -N700, LFO -N800, and LFO -N900 
were 36.54 m2 g-1, 23.47 m2 g-1, 17.63 m2 g-1, and 9.33 m2 g-1 respectively (Table 4.1). The 
resulting small particle size might be attributed to the advantageo us hydrothermal method 
(Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2012) .  
Fig. 4.6a shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) curves of the LaFeO 3 sample before calcination. As shown in Fig.  4.6a, there are two 
endothermic peaks at 289 °C and 412 °C in the DSC curve, which represent the decomposition 
and removal of organic components (C -H, C=O, C -N) (Yahya, Aziz et al. 2018)  and nitrates Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
61 
 (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2014) . It is noted that the area  below the DSC curve was found 
to be relatively broad, suggesting that smooth decomposition occur until the organic species 
were burned out completely (Tai and Lessing 1992) . In the vicinity of 200 °C, there are no 
exothermic or endothermic peaks detected, which confirms the absence of free citric acid in 
the sample because anhydrous citric acid decomposes between 160 -227 °C (Andoulsi, 
Horchani -Naifer et al. 2012) . In the TGA curve, a weight loss of 15% occurring at 30 – 300 °C 
can be ascribed to the elimination of absorbed surface water and decomposition of citric acid  
(Wang, Zhu et al. 2006) , which is also evident from first endothermic peak in the DSC curve. 
The 12% weight loss between 300 - 420 °C corresponds to the decomposition of remaining 
organic materials and nitrates (Qi, Zhou et al. 2003) . The minor endothermic peak in the DSC 
curve at 412 °C is due to the same process. The weight loss of 17% between 420 – 700 °C is 
attributed to the decomposition of oxycarbonates which are formed during citrate oxidation via 
itaconates or aconitates (Li, Tang et al. 2010, Thirumalairajan, Girija et al . 2012) .  The low 
intensity exothermic peak around 500 °C is possibly attributed to the crystallization of LFO 
(Yadav, Singh et al. 2016) .  It can be seen clearly from TG/DSC curves in Fig. 4.6a that there 
is no further weight loss above 700 °C as evidenced by a clear plateau observed for TG/DSC 
curves. This is consistent with the TGA analysis of the LFO after calcination at 600 °C, 700 
°C, 800 °C and 900 °C (shown in the inset of Fig.  4.6a). This is consistent with the observed 
XRD patterns which confirm the transformation of amorphous phase to crystalline phase.

 In order to confirm the above crystallinity and thermal decomposition pr ocess results, the 
surface chemistry of calcined LFO samples was examined using FTIR spectroscopy. FT -IR 
spectra in the frequency range from 4000 - 400 cm-1 of LFO samples calcined at different 
temperatures are shown in Fig. 4.6b. The band observed at 3612  cm-1 is characteristic of the 
H-O bending mode of absorbed water or the hydroxyl group. The intensity of this hydroxyl 
group band decreases slightly with increasing calcination temperature. Two weak bands at 
1506 and 1398 cm-1 can be attributed to the asy mmetric stretching of carbonates (Li, Tang et 
al. 2010) , implyi ng that carbonate species (which cannot be detected by XRD analysis) form 
on the LFO surface. The FTIR spectra of samples calcined at higher temperature have a sharper 
peak at 542 cm-1, showing the formation of LFO. The 542 cm-1 band corresponds to Fe -O 
stretching bands which are characteristics of the octahedral FeO 6 group in LFO (Feng, Liu et 
al. 2011, Abazari and Sanati 2013) . These observations agree with the results obtained from 
XRD pattern that the single crystalline LFO phase has already  been formed at 700 °C.  
In Fig. 4.7a, the absorption curves indicated that all LFO samples absorbed a considerable 
amount of visible light and in turn had a potential for use as visible -light-driven photocatalysts 
(Phokha, Pinitsoontorn et al. 2014) . There was a change  of absorbance  intensity as increasing 
calcination temperature (Fig. 4.7a). A similar observation was also reported by Su et al . (Su, 
Jing et al. 2010) . The corresponding band gap energy of LFO -N600, LFO -N700, LFO -N800 
and LFO -N900 was 2.24 eV, 2.27 eV, 2.34 eV and 2.35 eV respectively (Fig. 4.7a); suggesting 
their potential for visible light activation.  
Fig. 4.7b shows that the calcination temperature dramatically affected the photocatalytic 
performance of LFO. The sample of LFO -N600 calcined at 600 °C exhibited the weakest 
photocatalytic capacity. By increasing calcination temperature  from 600 °C  to 800 °C , the 
photocatalytic performance of sample was gradually improved. The degradation rate of LFO -
N600, LFO -N700 and LFO -N900 was found to be 89.7%, 94.8% and 97.7% after 90 min 
illumination. Especially, LFO -N800 showed the best performance, th at 98.2% of RhB was 
degraded after 90 min. This could be explained by its good  crystallinity, which normally 
endows enhanced photocatalytic performance of catalyst (Bi, Wu et al. 2009) . LFO -N800 
exhibited low band gap value, suggesting its good  visible light absorption capability.  Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

the removal of RhB using LFO -N600, LFO -N700, LFO -N800 and LFO -N900. (temperature = 
25 °C, initial dye concentration = 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 1.0 g L-1, initial H 2O2 
concentration = 0.3 g L-1, initial pH = 5).  
As can be seen from Fig.  4.8, after 90 min light illumination without the use of catalyst, around 
7% of RhB was degraded when dosing H 2O2 (RhB/H 2O2/light). On the other side, the exposure 
of pure RhB solution to visible light did not change its concentration (RhB/light). The mini mal 
changes in the RhB solution without catalyst indicated that RhB cannot self -decompose or be 
hardly degraded by H 2O2 only under visible light irradiation. When the experiment was carried 
out in the dark, the degradation % of RhB using LFO -N800 in the pr esence of H 2O2 was up to 
approximately 10% (RhB/LFO/H 2O2/dark). As compared with the above degradation data, the 
much poorer degradation % strongly suggests LFO, H 2O2 and visible light be necessary to 
achieve efficient photo -Fenton -like degradation of RhB in our system.

in dark) and RhB/LFO/light (RhB solution without H 2O2 but with LFO -N800 under visible 
light).  
Herein, for comparison, a bulk LFO sample was synthesized by solid -state reaction following 
the literature (Acharya, Mondal et al. 2010) . After 90 min illumination with visible light, its 
RhB degradation was only 9%, which was 10 times less than that of LFO -N800 synthesized 
via our hydrothermal reaction. On the basis of our investigation, the morphological, structural, 
optical properties r emarkably affected the visible -light-excited photo -Fenton catalytic activity 
of LFO synthesized via the hydrothermal method. The LFO -N800 sample exhibited high 
crystallinity, good surface area, s mall particle size and low band gap energy, resulting in high 
photocatalytic activity. It was chosen for the further process optimization.  
4.3.2 Photocatalytic degradation  
4.3.2.1 Effect of catalyst loading  
The effect of LFO -N800 loading within a range of 0.3 g L-1 to 1 g L-1 on the photocatalytic 
degradation % of RhB was examined. Fig. 4.9 shows that as the catalyst loading changing from 
0.3 g L-1 to 0.5 g L-1, the photodegradation rate of LFO -N800 increased. It may be attributed 
to the increasing availability of active sites on photocatalyst surface and subsequently 
generation of hydroxyl radicals (Feng, Hu et al. 2004) . Howev er, the further increase of catalyst 
dose might cause greater turbidity of suspension and in turn reduce the transmission of visible 
light into it (Chakrabarti and Dutta 2004, Pera -Titus, Garcı́a-Molina et al. 2004) . Therefore, a 
Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 decrease of degradation efficiency was observed when the catalyst dosage increased to 0.8 g 
L-1 – 1.0 g L-1. 
 
Fig. 4.9. Effect of catalyst loading on photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of RhB using LFO -
N800 (temperature = 25 °C, initial dye concentration = 10 mg L-1, initial H 2O2 concentration = 
0.3 g L-1 and initial pH = 5).  
4.3.2.2 Effect of H 2O2 dosage  
Fig. 4.10 reveals that the decomposition of RhB is significantly affected by varying H 2O2 
dosage from 0.1 g L-1 to 0.5 g L-1. When the H 2O2 concentration was increased from 0.1 g L-1 
to 0.2 g L-1, the residual RhB concentration in solution was from 1.0% to 0.5% after 90 min 
visible light illumination. In particular, 99.5% of RhB was degraded in 90 min by dosing 0.2 g 
L-1 H2O2, possibly due to the increasing number of hydroxyl radicals generated at a high H 2O2 
dosage (Guo, Zhang et al. 2013) . However, as the H 2O2 dosage was raised up to 0.5 g L-1, there 
was a decrease in the removal of RhB. It is worth noting that excessive amount of H 2O2 may 
promote the combination of H 2O2 and •OH to form some less reactive species, such as HO 2• 
(shown in  the following  Eq. (4.9)). It subsequently reduces the number of hydroxyl radicals 
reacting with organic pollutants and results in a decline of degradation (Wang, Priambodo et 
al. 2015) .

(temperature = 25 °C, initial concentration of RhB = 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 0.5 g L-1 and 
initial pH = 5).  
4.3.2.3 Effect of initial pH  
In the photo -Fenton -like process, the solution pH affects the genera tion of hydroxyl radicals 
(Selvam, Muruganandham et al. 2005) . Therefore, the solution pH is one of the most important 
factors affecting the photodegradation of organic pollutants. The pH of wastewater containing 
dye organics may vary depending on industrial applications. In this study we focused on the 
pH range of 4 – 8.  
As can be seen from Fig. 4.11, the photodegradation efficiency decreased with increasing pH, 
which is consistent with the previous reports using LFO synthesized via sol-gel to degrade 
refractory organic compounds and LFO prepared by impregnation me thod for acetic acid 
oxidation (Sannino, Vaiano et al. 2011, Nie, Zhang et al. 2015) . The similar observations have 
been reported for photo -Fenton process using Fe -based catalysts (Guo, Zhang et al. 2014) . The 
low degradation % of RhB at high pH might be attributed to the decomposition of H 2O2 into 
less reactive hydroperoxyl radicals HO 2• in basic medium; meanwhile the formation of 
zwitterionic form of RhB molecules at pH > 4 is less attackable by •OH radicals (Sachdeva and 
Kumar 2009, Merouani, Hamdaoui et al. 2010, Gan and Li 2013) . It is noted that degradation 
% was similar when the initial pH of solution was 4 and 5; that approximately 99% 
decomposition efficiency was attained after 90 min visible light irradiation. Since the dye -
containing wastewater generally has neutral or slig htly acidic pH, the optimal pH for photo -
Fenton -like degradation of RhB using LFO -N800 was suggested being 5, which would largely 
save expense in pH adjustment for practical application.

(temperature = 25 °C, RhB concentration = 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 0.5 g L-1 and initial 
H2O2 concentration = 0.2 g L-1). 
4.3.2.4 Reusability of catalyst  
It can be observed from the Fig. 4.12a that there was no significant loss of activity for LFO -
N800 after four cycles of application. The XRD diffraction pattern of material after the fourth 
run of degradation was similar to that of the fresh catalyst (Fig.  4.12b), suggesting the stability 
of LFO -N800 during reaction. Moreover, the concentration s of La and Fe in the solution after 
degradation w ere 4.3 mg L-1 and 3×10-3 mg L-1, respectively. The negligible concentration of 
dissolved ion detected implied that no significant contribution of homogeneous photo -Fenton 
reaction occurred. Although a slightly higher amount of dissolved La was detected, which does 
not play an essential role in contributing to catalytic degradation of RhB, the stability test over 
cycles  and relevant XRD characterization before and after degradation test suggest LFO -N800 
be stable and reusable in the application of wastewater treatment.

4.3.3. RhB degradation  mechanism  
It has been known that iron -based catalysts can activate H 2O2 to produce •OH radicals through 
the photo -Fenton -like reaction and enhance decomposition of organic pollutants (Li, Wang et 
al. 2014) . Based on our photodegradation result s, the use of LFO might initiate the activation 
of H 2O2 via two pathways , as shown in the following relations. The first pathway is suggested 
as a heterogeneous Fenton -like catalytic mechanism. In the photo -Fenton reaction (Kwan and 
Voelker 2003) , a complex of ≡FeIIIH2O2 may form between ≡FeIII and H 2O2 (Eq. (4.10)), 
where ≡FeIII stands for Fe (III) sites on the catalyst surface. The initially generated ≡FeIIIH2O2 
is then converted into ≡FeII and HO 2• (Eq. (4.11)); the generated HO 2• may subsequently react 
with ≡FeIII to produce ≡FeII (Eq. (4.12)). The formed ≡FeII reacts with H 2O2 to generate •OH 
radical (Eq. (4.13)), which induces the degradation of organic dye (Eq. (4.16)). The second 
pathway could be that LFO absorbs visible light and then undergo charge separation (Eq. 
(4.14)); after which the electrons are trapped by H 2O2 to generate •OH (Eq. (4.15)). Obviously, 
under visible light irradiation, the increase in the rate o f RhB degradation could be attributed 
to the combined effects of Fenton process and conduction electron scavenging (Ju, Chen et al. 
2011, Li, Zhang et al. 2014) . Based on the above discussion, a photo -Fenton -like photocatalytic 
degradation mechanism is proposed as presented in Fig. 4.13. The RhB degradation is as 
follows:

 ≡FeIII + H 2O2 → ≡FeIIIH2O2 (4.10) 
≡FeIIIH2O2 → ≡FeII + HO 2• + H+ (4.11) 
≡FeIII + HO 2• + H+ → ≡FeII + O 2 + 2H+ (4.12) 
≡FeII + H 2O2 → ≡FeIII + •OH + OH- (4.13) 
LaFeO 3 + hʋ → 𝑒𝑐𝑏− + ℎ𝑣𝑏+ (4.14) 
H2O2 + 𝑒𝑐𝑏− → •OH + OH- (4.15) 
•OH + RhB → Degradation products  (4.16)

To further confirm the role of •OH radical in dye degradation, ESR spin -trap technique with 
DMPO was adopted herein (Fig. 4.14).

Fig. 4.14. ESR spectra of DMPO -•OH adducts in the system of LFO/H 2O2/dark and 
LFO/H 2O2/light. For comparison, the ESR spectra for the systems of LFO/light and LFO/dark 
were included.  
Relatively weak signals with an intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1, corresponding to the characteristic 
peaks of DMPO/•OH adducts, appeared in the LFO/H 2O2/dark system before visible light 
irradiation. It might be caused by the reactions  as shown in Eqs. (4.10) – (4.13). This is also in 
a good agreement with the fact that 10% of RhB was decomposed in the system of 
RhB/LFO/H 2O2/dark (Fig. 4.8). Meanwhile, under visible light illumination, the intensity of 
these DMPO/•OH signals for LFO/H 2O2/light system was stronger than that in the dark, 
suggesting that the electrons generated by the excitation of catalyst under visible light 
irradiation be trapped by H 2O2 to produce •OH (Eq. (4.14) and Eq. (4.15)). There were no 
characteristic peak signals of •OH radicals appearing in the experiment of LFO/dark and 
LFO/light. Therefore, the ESR experimental results further clarified the generation of hydroxyl 
radicals and their role in the photo -Fenton -like degrada tion of RhB when using LFO -N800 as 
the catalyst.  
As seen above, more than 99% of RhB was degraded in 90 min by dosing 0.2 g L-1 H2O2, 
adding 0.5 g L-1 catalyst in the solution of 10 mg L-1 RhB and initial pH 5. In the similar testing 
systems, our catalyst showed comparable performance to the literature (Guo, Fang et al. 2011, 
Guo, Zhang et al. 2014) . However, it should be noted the variations in the selection of 
degradation parameters (e.g. , pH, H 2O2 dosage, dye  concentration, etc.) as well as light source 
equipment. Herein the use of hydrothermal synthetic method to prepare catalyst may provide 
advantageous feature for the large -scale fabrication, including low temperature and process 
simplicity. It performed go od degradation activity, especially under our optimized conditions 
Chapter 4                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 (temperature = 25 °C, RhB concentration = 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 0.5 g L-1 and initial 
H2O2 concentration = 0.2 g L-1). This indicates the future practical large -scale application of 
such catalyst needs optimization. For example, when the solution pH was increased above 5, a 
dramatic reduction of degradation rate was observed, suggesting adequate adjustment of 
solution pH be necessary, which might increase cost in wastewater pre -treatm ent or/and post -
treatment. Moreover, the adoption of photo -Fenton process in treating highly polluted 
wastewater using visible light would require solar reaction with large surface area, which 
constitutes a major obstacle for industrial use (Bernabeu, Vercher et al. 2011) . During the 
study, we also found that the selection of suitable light source was of vital meaning, 
significantly affecting degradation performance. Other issues should not b e neglected when 
scaling up the application of our catalyst in industry, such as the efficient recovery of slurry 
after photodegrading.  
4.4. Conclusions  
In summary, the morphology, structure and optical properties of LaFeO 3 (LFO), synthesized 
via hydrothermal method, were significantly affected by the selection of iron precursor, 
synthetic solution pH and calcination temperature. LFO -N800, which was prepared by using 
ferric nitrate as iron precursor in the synthetic solution of pH = 9, followed by the calcination 
at 800 °C, exhibited favourable material characteristics and in turn good photocatalytic activity. 
Almost 100% of degradation rate was achieved after 90 min visible light illumination under 
the initial conditions of pH = 5, 10 mg L-1 RhB, 0 .2 g L-1 H2O2, and 0.5 g L-1 catalyst loading. 
The ESR experimental results clarified the generation of hydroxyl radicals and their role in the 
photo -Fenton -like catalytic degradation of RhB when using LFO -N800 as the catalyst. The 
good degradation efficie ncy, reusability and chemical stability of LFO -N800 suggest it has 
great potential as a promising catalyst for practical removal of organic pollutants via photo -
Fenton -like reaction.

5.1 Introduction  
Organic dyes from textile production and other industrial processes are one of the main groups 
of pollutants in wastewater (Touati, Hammedi et al. 2016) . Azo dyes, including reactive black 
5, methyl orange (MO), acid orange 7, represent 60 – 70% of all organ ic dyes produced in the 
world. The discharge of azo dye -containing effluent streams without treatment has created 
serious environmental pollution and threats to human health by releasing toxic and 
carcinogenic compounds (Bafana, Devi et al. 2011) . Various methods, including biological, 
physical and chemical means, have been widely studied to eliminate azo dyes from wastewater 
(Robinson, McMullan et al. 2001, Vaiano, Matarangolo et al. 2017) . In particular, advanced 
oxidation processes (AOPs) have beco me an increasing area of research interest for removing 
recalcitrant organic compounds in wastewater, due to its efficient and eco -friendly application. 
These processes rely on the production of strongly oxidising agents, mainly hydroxyl radicals 
(•OH), wh ich are capable of oxidizing the majority of refractory compounds in industrial 
effluents due to the high oxidation potential (2.8 V) (Malato, Blanco et al. 2002, Aleboyeh, 
Aleboyeh et al. 2003, Zangeneh, Zinatizadeh et al. 2015, Dang and Lee 2017) . One of the most 
efficient AOPs is Fenton process, basically divided into the h omogeneous and heterogeneous 
systems based on the physical state of catalyst. Compared to the homogeneous one, the 
heterogeneous Fenton process can oxidize a variety of organic pollutants in a wide pH range 
rapidly and non -selectively with the generation o f little iron sludge. Other advantages include 
the complete mineralization of organic compounds and easy operation at mild condition 
(Ramirez, Maldonado -Hódar et al. 2007, Papić, Vujević et al. 2009, Rodriguez, Ovejero et al. 
2009) . The heterogeneous Fenton process involves the reaction between Fe -based solid catalyst Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
73 
 and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which are oxidants capable 
of degrading various organic contaminants in wastewater (Legrini, Oliveros  et al. 1993, Xu, 
Wang et al. 2011) . In the presence of either ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, visible light or both 
these light sources, a photo -Fenton reaction occurs, which has higher degradation rate than the 
Fenton process (Chacón, Leal et al. 2006, Ye, Yang et al. 2018) . As compared with the 
relatively high cost and energy consumption when utilizing light source to generate UV light, 
the adoption of visible light is more economical.    
Recently, perovskite with the general formula ABO 3 (A = usually an alkaline, alkaline earth or 
rare earth element; B = transition metal) have been recognized as an efficient form of 
heterogeneous catalyst s to participate in the photo -Fenton process for the degradation of 
organic pollutants (2016, Soltani and Lee 2016, Palas, Ersöz e t al. 2017, Soltani and Lee 2017, 
Dükkancı 2018) . LaFeO 3 (LFO) is one of the widely selected perovskite s for study due to its 
non-toxicity, stability, and small band gap energy. Li and co -workers prepared the LFO  
heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like catalyst by sol -gel method for rhodamine B (RhB) 
degradation; in which over 97% of RhB was decomposed after 2 h visible light irradiation 
under the reaction conditions of 1 mL of 3% H 2O2, 1 g L-1 catalyst and 10-5 mol/L initial RhB 
concentration (Li, Wang et al. 2014) . The LaMeO 3 (Me = Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Cu) perovskites 
supported on cordierite monolith, which were prepared by impregnation method, exhibited 
photo -Fenton activity to remove acetic acid; especially the use of 10.5 wt% LFO supported on 
cordierite monolith reached 93% TOC removal after 7 h under a variable addition of H 2O2 
(0.014  M/h after 1  h and 0.007  M/h in the rest of test) at pH = 3.9 under UV light irradiation 
(Sannino, Vaiano et al. 2011) . Orak et al.  prepared  LFO on a monolithic structure by sol -gel 
method and yielded almost complete removal of methylparaben (MP) after 30 min under the 
reaction conditions of 0.1 g L-1 catalyst, 5 ppm MP, 1 mM of H 2O2, initial pH 7 and UV light 
power of 12 W (Orak, Atalay et al. 2017) . However, these photo -Fenton -like decontamination 
processes need a relatively long reaction time or special UV light source to complete. 
Therefore, we believe it is desirable to explore other heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like 
perovskite catalysts targeting at the fast and high removal of organic from water. Especially, 
from the point of view of practical application, the development of heterogeneous photo -Fenton 
process using visible light is particularly meaningful in terms of cost and energy effectiveness.  
Replacing the element on the A - or B-site in the ABO 3 structure, which leads to the change in 
the composition and symmetry of material, is considered as a promising strategy to improve 
photocatalytic performance of a catalys t (Pena and Fierro 2001, Magalhães, Moura et al. 2008, Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 Carrasco -Díaz, Castillejos -López et al. 2016, Soltani and Lee 2016) . Such doping approach 
could not only introduce defect to narrow band gap, but also cause oxygen vacancy inhibiting 
the recombination between photogenerated electrons and holes on the photocatalyst surface. 
Different metal ions throu gh A - or B-site substitution of LFO have been proven to effectively 
improve its photo -Fenton catalytic activity for organic degradation (Hou, Sun et al. 2006, Li, 
Liu et al. 2010, Jauhar, Dhiman et al. 2015) . Li and co -workers investigated the photocatalytic 
activity of Ca -doped LaFeO 3, which was prepared in reverse microemulsion, for the 
degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light (Li, Liu et al. 2010) . The LFO sample 
doped with 10 mol% Ca exhibited the highest degradation rate (77.5%) in 60 min under the 
reaction conditions of 0.5 g L-1 catalyst dosage and 10 mg L-1 initial M B concentration among 
different Ca -doped LFO (5 – 20 mol%). The substitution of Li into La -site in LFO was found 
to considerably improve the photocatalytic performance of catalyst for the degradation of 
methyl blue and acrylon effluents (Hou, Sun et al. 2006) . The optimized catalyst, which was 
synthesized by the acetic acid based sol -gel metho d, could remove 99% methyl blue and 45.7% 
acrylon effluents in 60 min under UV -visible light illumination. Jauha et al.  used Mn -doped 
LFO as a photo -Fenton catalyst to degrade anionic and cationic dyes, including Remazol 
Turquoise Blue, Remazol Brilliant Y ellow, MB and Safranine -O, respectively (Jauhar, Dhiman 
et al. 2015) . Their results suggested that the photocatalytic activity under visible light 
irradiation be enhanced; however, the fur ther increase of Mn doping did not considerably 
improve the photoactivity of resulting material.  
Previous study has suggested that the catalytic property of ABO 3 be mainly determined by the 
nature of B -site (Pena and Fierro 2001) . The refore, the substitution of Fe -site in LFO by a 
reductive and active metal shows potential to dramatically improve photocatalytic activity of 
resulting material. In our literature survey (Zhang, Dou et al. 2007, H an, Dong et al. 2011, 
Liang, Zhong et al. 2012, Bokare and Choi 2014) , in addition to Fe, other multiple redox state 
elements such as, cerium (Ce), manganese (Mg), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co) 
can react with H 2O2 to generate •OH in the Fenton -like process. Especial ly, Cu attracted our 
research interest as a substituting cation due to its advantageous features over Fe (Eberhardt, 
Ramirez et al. 1989, Perez -Benito 2004, Lam, Yip et al. 2007, Nichela, Berkovic et al. 2013, 
Bao, Zhang et al. 2015, Lyu, Zhang et al. 2015) . For example, Cu endows high reducibility; 
the reduction of Cu(II) by H 2O2 occurs more easily than that of Fe(III). The Cu(I)/H 2O2 system 
shows a higher reaction rate than the Fe(II)/H 2O2 system in terms of organic decomposition. 
Moreover, a Cu -based Fenton -like system can work over a wider pH range than a Fe -based Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 one. The use  of Cu as a dopant and its incorporation into the perovskite lattice has  been proven 
to narrow the band gap and enhance the catalytic activity of parent perovskite, e.g. , LaCoO 3, 
BiFeO 3, LaAlO 3 or CaTiO 3 (Zhang, Chen et al. 2010, Wang, Pang et al. 2015, Mao, Quan et 
al. 2018, Wang, Zhang et al. 2018) . To the best of our knowledge, no study has been reported 
on the applicability of Cu -doped LFO  as a heterogeneous photo -Fenton catalyst for organic dye 
degradation under visible light. In th is study, Cu -doped LFO was prepared by a facile one -step 
hydrothermal method, which shows advantageous features towards industrial application, e.g. , 
low temperature, cost effectiveness and process simplicity. Its photo -Fenton -like catalytic 
activity for t he decolorization of 10 mg L-1 MO, MB and RhB solution, which concentration 
has been normally adopted in the photodegradation test of different dyes over a variety of 
heterogeneous catalysts (Wei, Fan et al. 2012, Nezamzadeh -Ejhieh and Moazzeni 2013, 
Ansari, Khan et al. 2014, Park, Park et al. 2015, Hanifehpour, Soltani et al. 2016, Jiang, Li et 
al. 2016,  Nguyen -Le, Lee et al. 2017) , under visible light was evaluated for the first time. Based 
on our experimental results, including the c atalyst morphological, structural and chemical 
properties, and electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis, possible catalytic mechanisms of Cu -
doped LFO that improved degradation efficiency were also developed. Its stability and 
reusability in the photo -Fenton  catalytic degradation of MO was assessed, followed by the 
examination and optimization on the effects of H 2O2 concentration, catalyst dosage and initial 
solution pH on material photocatalytic activity.  
5.2. Experimental  
5.2.1 Catalyst preparation  
Analytical grade La(NO 3)3.6H 2O, Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O, Cu(NO 3)2.3H 2O and citric acid were 
purchased from Sigma -Aldrich and used as the starting materials. Cu-doped LaFeO 3 (LaFe 1-
xCuxO3; x = 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol% of Cu) was prepared via the hydrothermal method (Kumar 
and Jayavel 2014) . Typically, the precursor solution was prepared by mixing La(NO 3)3.6H 2O, 
Cu(NO 3)2.3H 2O, Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O, and citric acid in deionized (DI) water. Both the molar 
concentration of citric acid and the total molar concentration of metal nitrates (La(NO 3)3.6H 2O, 
Cu(NO 3)2.3H 2O, Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O) were 1 mol L-1. The obtained precursor solution was 
continuously s tirred for 2 h at room temperature. Ammonia solution (25%, Sigma -Aldrich) was 
slowly added to the solution to adjust the solution pH to 9 before transferring the resulting 
solution into 50 mL Teflon -lined autoclave. The solution was then heated at 180 °C f or 20 h. 
After that, the autoclave was allowed to cool down to 25 °C naturally. The obtained product Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 was washed with DI water and ethanol, and dried at 80 °C for 5 h in air. It was then calcined 
in air at 800 °C for 6 h (ramp rate of 5 °C  min-1 from 25 to 800 °C) to obtain the final catalyst. 
The prepared catalysts were named as LFO -5Cu, LFO -10Cu, LFO -15Cu and LFO -20Cu, 
respectively, according to 5, 10, 15 and 20 mol% Cu doping concentration in the synthetic 
solution. For comparison, the LaFeO 3 catalyst (LF O-0Cu) was synthesized following the above 
procedures but without adding Cu(NO 3)2.3H 2O during synthesis.  
5.2.2 Catalyst characterization  
Morphology of the catalysts was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, 5 kV, Zeiss 
1555, VP -FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, 200 kV, TEM -TITAN). The 
powder sample was coated by sputtering of a thin platinum layer before performing SEM. The 
sample for TEM was dispersed in ethanol and then deposited on a carbon -copper grid to allow 
the solven t to evaporate at ambient temperature. X -ray powder diffraction (XRD) experiments 
were performed on a GBC eMMA X -ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation using an 
acceleration voltage of 35 kV and a current of 28 mA. The diffraction angle 2 θ was scanned 
from 20 to 80 ° at a rate of 1 °  min-1. Average crystallite size of the sample was calculated from 
the XRD patterns according to the Scherrer equation (Scherrer 1918, Rohani Bastami, 
Ahmadpour et al. 2017) . Lattice parameters of the sample were determined using the Bragg’s 
law and the equation  1
d2=h2
a2+k2
b2+l2
c2 (Tay, Huan et al. 2002)  (d is lattice spacing (Å); h, k, l  
are lattice planes and a, b, c  are lattice parameters (Å)). The cell volume was obtained by a × 
b × c  due to its orthorhombic structure. Nitrogen adsorption -desorption isotherms were 
measured at 77 K using SAPA2010 (Micromeritics Inc, USA). Prior to analy sis, the samples 
were degassed at 200 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The surface area was determined from the 
linear part of the BET plot (P/P 0 = 0.05 ~ 0.20) and the por e size was calculated from desorption 
branch of the isotherm by using Barrett -Joyner -Hallen da (BJH). The total pore volume was 
evaluated from the adsorbed nitrogen amount at a relative pressure of 0.98.  Compositions of 
the catalysts were determined by chemical analysis using Inductively Coupled Plasma – Mass 
Spectrometry (ICP -MS, PerkinElmer’s NexION 350). The digestion of sample was conducted 
by mixing 0.005 g of catalyst with 10 mL of aqua regia, followed by heating at 100 °C for 24 
h. The digested sample was diluted with 2% HNO 3 to lower its concentration below 100 ppb 
for ICP -MS analysis. X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were taken on Kratos AXIS 
Ultra DLD X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Perkin -Elmer) using a monochromated Al -Kα 
X-ray source ( hʋ = 1486.6 eV) at  chamber pressured bett er than 8 x 10-9 Torr. Optical  properties Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 of the samples were characterized on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis/NIR 
spectrophotometer mounted with an integrating sphere accessor and using BaSO 4 as a 
reference. Band gap energy of the sample was obtained from the plot of Kubelka -Munck 
function [F(R)h ʋ]2 versus  the energy of adsorbed light hʋ (García -López, Marcì et al. 2015) . 
5.2.3 Photocatalytic organic degradation and its mechanism study  
Photocatalytic activity of the catalyst leading to the degradation of methyl orange (MO) (details 
in Table 5.1) in aqueous solution was carried out under visible light. The degradation 
experiment was performed in a cylindrical Pyrex vessel surrounded by a circulating water 
jacket to keep the reaction temperature at ambient temperature. The catalyst was dispersed into 
100 mL of 10 mg L-1 MO aqueous solution. A photo -Fenton reaction was initiated by 
introducing 1 mL H 2O2 to the suspension. A Xenon lamp (CEL -HX F300, Beijing, China) with 
a 400 nm cut -off filter to ensure the suspension was illuminated under visible light for 
photocatalytic degradation test. In all photodegradation tests, the illuminated area of solution 
was 24 cm2 and the intensity of light was  1734 W/m2, which was measured by TES 132 -Solar 
power meter (US). Before light irradiation, the solution was magnetically stirred in the dark for 
30 min to reach the adsorption -desorption equilibrium of MO onto the catalyst. Subsequently, 
the suspension wa s exposed to visible light for 60 min, during which the sample was taken 
from the suspension every 10 min for analysis. The catalyst was removed from each analysis 
sample by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The remaining solution was tested for the  
concentration of MO using Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis spectrometer and examined for 
the concentration of metal ions (La, Fe, and Cu) using ICP -MS (PerkinElmer’s NexION 350). 
Several factors, including the catalyst dosage, the initial H 2O2 concentration , the initial solution 
pH and co -existing inorganic salt NaCl were studied herein. The catalyst dosage was varied 
from 0.5 to 1.2 g L-1. The initial solution pH value was adjusted from 4 to 8 by adding HCl or 
NaOH solution. The effect of H 2O2 dosage on the  degradation of MO was examined by varying 
the initial concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 g L-1. To investigate the effect of co -existing ion on the 
photodegradation of MO, 0.01 M NaCl was added into the solution.  
The photodegradation data were fitted with the pseudo -first-order kinetic model. The apparent 
rate constant  k was obtained from the slope of the straight line by plotting -ln(C/C0) as a 
function of time, t, through regression; where C0 and C were the initi al dye concentration and 
the dye concentration at a given period of time t, respectively. Herein, the corresponding 
regression coefficients R2 were above 0.975. In addition to MO, MB and RhB (details in Table  Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 5.1) were chosen to further evaluate the photo -Fenton catalytic performance of LFO -15Cu 
following the same procedures as above.  
To test stability and recyclability of the catalyst, repetitive degradation test was performed 
using LFO -15Cu. After the degradation experiment, the suspension was centrifuge d at 10,000 
rpm to separate the catalyst particles and aqueous solution. The collected catalyst was then 
reused in a new degradation experiment. This process was repeated for several times.  
Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used to examine ph otodegradation 
mechanism by detecting reactive oxygen species. Three conditions were selected herein for 
test, including LFO -15Cu/H 2O2/Light (10 mg L-1 MO solution with 0.8 g L-1 LFO -15Cu in the 
presence of 0.3 g L-1 H2O2 under visible light irradiation), LFO -15Cu/H 2O2/Dark (10 mg L-1 
MO solution with 0.8 g L-1 LFO-15Cu in the presence of 0.3 g L-1 H2O2 in dark) and 
LFO/H 2O2/Light (10 mg L-1 MO solution with 0.8 g L-1 LFO-0Cu in the presence of 0.3 g L-1 
H2O2 under visible  light irradiation). In 2 minutes after starting the reaction, 100 µL of the 
sample was collected from the reaction suspension and immediately mixed with 20 µL of 0.2 
mol L-1 DMPO to form DMPO -•OH adduct. The ESR spectra were obtained on a Bruker ESR 
300E with microwave bridge (receiver gain: 40 dB; modulation amplitude: 1 Gauss; 
microwave power: 2.10-4 mW; modulation frequency: 100 kHz).

 5.3. Results and discussion  
5.3.1 Catalyst characterization  
5.3.1.1 XRD analysis  
As shown in Fig. 5.1, the crystal structures of LaFe 1-xCuxO3 samples (LFO -5Cu – LFO-20Cu) 
were not affected by the presence of Cu dopants, as all peaks were identical to that of LFO 
(LFO -0Cu). The characteristic diffraction peaks at 22.6°, 32.2°, 38.0°, 39.6o, 46.3°, 52.0°, 
53.3o, 57.4°, 67.4o, 72.0o and 76.7o in the diffraction data of all samples can be indexed as the 
crystal planes of (101), (121), (112), (220), (202), (141), (311), (240), (242), (143) and (204), 
indicating that the fabricated samples were well crystallized with orthorhombic structure 
(JCPDS No. 37 -1493) (Thirumalaira jan, Girija et al. 2013, Pei, Du et al. 2015) . No crystalline 
Cu peaks were observed and the single perovskite phase formed in all cases (LFO -5Cu – LFO-
20Cu). However, the increase of Cu doping decreased the intensity of diffraction peaks and 
broadened them.  
 
Fig. 5.1. XRD patterns of LFO and LaFe 1-xCuxO3.  
Table 5.2 shows the lattice parameters, cell volumes and average crystallite sizes of LFO and 
LaFe 1-xCuxO3. As can be seen, the cell volume of LaFe 1-xCuxO3 was slightly smaller than that 
of LFO; this value decreased with increasing Cu doping. Obviously, the introduction of Cu(II) 
with larger ionic radius (0.730 Å) to replace Fe(III) with smaller ionic radius (0.645 Å) did not 
lead to the expansion of LFO uni t-cell (Caronna, Fontana et al. 2009) . The smaller cell volume 
of LaFe 1-xCuxO3 might be caused by the defects in the form of anionic vacancies, which

 maintained the electroneutrality in LaFe 1-xCuxO3 (Schön, Dacquin et al. 2017) . In Table 5.2, 
the cry stallite sizes of Cu -doped LFO samples were smaller than that of undoped sample and 
decreased with increasing amount of Cu dopant. This is in good agreement with the literature 
(Parrino, García -López et al. 2016) , revealing Cu doping could cause lattice distortion and 
suppress growth of large crystalli tes in the samples. The high degree of crystallinity  with few 
defects  helps to minimize the recombination of electron -hole pairs, leading to enhanced 
efficiency of photodegradation (Wang, Zhang et al. 2014) .

5.3.1.2 Nitrogen adsorption -desorption analysis  
In the N 2 adsorption -desorption isotherms of LFO and LaFe 1-xCuxO3 samples (Fig. 5.2), all the 
samples showed type IV isotherms with type H3 hysteresis loop, where a steep increase was 
found in high -pressure range (0.8 < P/P 0 < 1). This could probably be associated with the pores 
formed between the particles due to aggregation. Table 5.3 summarizes the corresponding 
values of BET surface area, pore volume and pore size. The LaFe 1-xCuxO3 samples, especially 
LFO-15Cu, exhibited slightly larger specific areas than the LFO sample; which might be the 
advantageous feature providing more active sites for the degradation to take place and 
improving phot ocatalytic degradation efficiency.  Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

We believe that the addition of Cu source during hydrothermal synthesis would affect the 
crystallization of catalyst and in turn its structural properties. The possible mechanisms of 
LaFe 1-xCuxO3 formation are proposed as follows based on the literature (Thirumalairajan, 
Girija et al. 2012) :        
La(NO 3)3 → La3+ + 3NO 3- (5.1) 
Fe(NO 3)3 → Fe3+ + 3OH- → Fe(OH) 3 (5.2) 
Cu(NO 3)2 → Cu2+ + 2OH- → Cu(OH) 2 (5.3) 
Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
82 
 La3+ + C 6O7H8 → [C 6O7H5]3-La3+ + 3H+ (5.4) 
[C6O7H5]3-La3+ + 3OH- → La(OH) 3 + [C 6O7H5]3- (5.5) 
La(OH) 3 + Fe(OH) 3 + Cu(OH) 2 → LaFe 1-xCuxO3 + H 2O (5.6) 
La(NO 3)3 released La3+ when dissociated in water (Eq. (5.1)), which tended to chelate with 
citric acid (Eq. (5.4)). The resulting compound slowly reacted with hydroxide during 
hydrothermal reaction into La(OH) 3 via alcoholysis (Eq. (5.5)). On the other side, Fe(NO 3)3 
and Cu(NO 3)2 dissociated into Fe3+ and Cu2+, which were then hydrolysed to produce Fe(OH) 3 
and Cu(OH) 2 (Eq. (5.2) and (5.3)). The condensation of  Cu(OH) 2 – Fe(OH) 3 – La(OH) 3 system 
yielded Cu -doped LFO (Eq. (5.6)). The increasing addition of Cu source in the synthetic 
solution might affect the condensation of  Cu(OH) 2 – Fe(OH) 3 – La(OH) 3, and subsequent 
nucleation and crystallization of LaFe 1-xCuxO3 during hydrothermal reaction. Consequently, 
small particles with large S BET and small crystallite size were observed.                
5.3.1.3 Band gap characterization  
The UV -Vis absorption spe ctra and the corresponding band gap energy of LFO and LaFe 1-
xCuxO3 are shown in Fig. 5.3 a and b. It is noted that al l the samples had suitable band gap 
energy for organic pollutant degradation under visible light irradiation. Interestingly, the 
substitution of Cu into Fe -site in LFO modified the light absorption property of perovskite. 
Dong et al. also observed the decrease of gap energy when introduc ing Zn(II) (ionic radius = 
0.74 Å) into LFO (Dong, Xu et al. 2009) . The substitution of metal in the Fe -site of LFO might 
lead to the formation of oxygen vacancies and additional energy levels; thereby increasing the 
distance between atomics and narrowing the energy gap of material (Dong, Xu et a l. 2009) . 
The reduced band gap energy of LaFe 1-xCuxO3 would be the favourable characteristic for 
harvesting more photons; more photocharged electrons and holes can be generated, thus 
enhancing the photocatalytic activity of catalysts.  Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

LaFe 1-xCuxO3 . 
5.3.1.4 Morphological analysis  
As can be seen from Fig. 5.4, all the prepared samples exhibited similar morphology, consisting 
of agglomerated spherical -like particles. It is observed that the Cu -doping did not significantly 
affect the morphology and particle size of sample. However, when synthesized at high Cu 
doping concentration, the particles tended to merge together to form large agglomerates, as 
shown in Fig.  5.4.  
 
Fig. 5.4. SEM images of LFO and LaFe 1-xCuxO3. 
This may also explain the greater pore volumes and sizes, shown in Table 5.3, for the samples 
of LFO -15Cu and LFO -20Cu, when compared with others.  
Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
84 
 In the TEM images of LFO -0Cu and LFO -15Cu (Fig. 5.5), both samples showed sphere -like 
particles with diameters ranging from 30 – 70 nm, which is in an agreement with the SEM 
observation. Literature suggests small particle size as a favourable feature for enhancing 
photocatalytic activity because: (i) it r esults in large specific area, which may offer a large 
number of active sites for dye photodegradation; (ii) it helps to supress the recombination of 
photogenerated electron and hole pairs, which then migrate to particle surface and react with 
adsorbed dye  (Li, Lin et al.  2009) . There were no pure Cu particles observed on the surface of 
LFO-15Cu or in the surrounding environment, suggesting homogeneous substitution of Cu in 
the Fe -sites of LFO. The lattice fringes of LFO -0Cu and LFO -15Cu were 0.279 and 0.278 nm, 
respect ively, which matched with the (121) crystallographic plane of LFO (Thirumalairajan, 
Girija et al. 2013) .

5.3.1.5 Composition analysis and XPS measurements  
Table 5.3 shows the chemical compositions (Cu/Fe molar ratios) of LFO and LaFe 1-xCuxO3 
samples using ICP -MS analysis, suggesting that the actual Cu doping of LaFe 1-xCuxO3 samples 
are consistent with the theoretical values.  
To inspect the surface elemental compositi on and oxidation state of principal elements of LFO -
15Cu as compared with LFO -0Cu, the typical XPS spectra of La 3d, Fe 2p, O 1s and Cu 2p are 
illustrated in Fig. 5.6.  
Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

Fig. 5.6. XPS spectra of La 3d, Fe 2p, O 1s for LFO -0Cu and LFO -15Cu; and Cu 2p for L FO-
15Cu.  
As can be seen, the spectrum in the La 3d region demonstrated a binding energy at 834.2 eV 
for La 3d 5/2 and at 850.4 eV for La 3d 3/2, implying that La had an oxidation state of +3 in LFO -
15Cu and LFO -0Cu, which is in a good agreement with the lite rature (Thirumalairajan, Girija 
et al. 2013, Parrino, García -López et al. 2016) . The La 3d 5/2 peak revealed the typical complex 
structure of core -level photoemission spectra of light rare earth materials. The similarity for 
the peaks in the spectrum of La 3d region also suggests that the Cu doping did not sign ificantly 
affect the chemical environment of La (Parrino, García -López et al. 2016) . The O 1s spectrum 
presented two major peaks, suggesting that there be at least two kinds of O chemical states 
corresponding to the binding energy from 526.0 to 534.0 eV (Parrino, García -López et al. 
2016) . The binding energy of O 1s situated at 529.0 eV was due to the lattice oxygen species 
(OL) in LFO -0Cu and LFO -15Cu. Meanwhile, the other broad peak (O H) located at around 
531.0 eV was mainly caused by a partial hydroxylation and/or carbonatation at the material 
surface (Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2014, Parrino, García -López et al. 2016) . We note that 
there was a slight increase of intensity and broadening in the peak at 531.5 eV for the sample 
with Cu doping (LFO -15 Cu). It might be attributed to the enhanced hydroxylation and/or 
carbonatation onto the Cu -doped LFO material surface. The s table surface carbonates could 
block active sites and in turn suppressed photodegradation. On the other side, the higher surface 
Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
86 
 hydroxylation was suggested increasing the number of active sites, thus favouring 
photodegradation (Parrino, García -López et al. 2016) . The latter one is believed to play a 
dominating role herein when the reaction occurred in aqueous phase and seen from the 
following improved degradation results. Two strong peaks of Fe 2p 3/2 and Fe 2p 1/2 were located 
at 710.5 and 723.8 eV, respectively, which could be assigned to the +3 oxidat ion state of Fe in 
LFO-0Cu and LFO -15Cu (Xiao, Hong et al. 2013) . There was a slight shift of the Fe3+ peak in 
the LFO -15Cu spectrum, possibly caused by the change of Fe -O bond by int roducing Cu in 
Fe-site (Peng, Shan et al. 2015) . In the Cu 2p spectrum of LFO -15Cu, the characteristic peaks 
of Cu 2p 1/2 and Cu 2p 3/2 located at 953.5 and 933.2 eV, respectively; and a satellite peak at 
942.3 eV, which can be attributed to the +2 oxidation state of Cu (Chen, Chen et al. 2 012, 
Parrino, García -López et al. 2016, Jeghan, Do et al. 2017) . Note that, the raw XPS spectrum of 
Cu2p ( the black curve) was smoothed  to show  as the red curve  against the background line, 
which was indicated by the green line. The results of XPS spectra obviously indicate that the 
doping with Cu into LFO did not form other phases.  
5.3.2. Photo -Fenton degradation of MO  
5.3.2.1. Copper doping on MO degradation  
The photocatalytic activity of LFO and LaFe 1-xCuxO3 was evaluated by the degradation of MO 
in the presence of visible light and H 2O2. Before starting light illumination, the adsorption of 
MO onto LFO and LaFe 1-xCuxO3 was found negligible, which was less th an 3%.

M); and (b) plots of -ln (C/C0) versus  irradiation time.  
As can be seen in Fig. 5.7, the LaFe 1-xCuxO3 samples exhibited much better catalytic activity 
for MO degradation than the LFO sample. As the amount of Cu doping increa sed, the MO 
degradation efficiency increased; but it suffered a decrease when using LFO -20Cu. There 
appear to be an optimum amount of Cu doping to obtain the maximum rate of photodegradation 
of MO, with the photocatalytic efficiency following the order: LF O-0Cu < LFO -5Cu < LFO -
20Cu < LFO -10Cu < LFO -15Cu. The LFO -15Cu sample showed the highest catalytic activity 
with over 90% of MO removed after 60 min exposure to visible light, which is significantly 
greater than 33% of MO removed by LFO -0Cu. The pseudo -first-order model was used to 
better understand the reaction kinetic of MO degradation (Hanifehpour, Soltani et al. 2016) . 
From the pseudo -first-order kinetic modelling (Fig. 5.7b), the apparent rate constant  k was 
0.0064, 0.0144, 0.0243, 0.0414, and 0.0195 min-1 for LFO -0Cu, LFO -5Cu, LFO -10Cu, LFO -
15Cu and LFO -20Cu, respectively. The highest value of k was observed for LFO -15Cu, 
suggesting the fastest degradation rate and best photocatalytic activity.

 time increased, the absorption maximum of MO at λ = 464 nm steadily decreased. There was 
little change in the absorption maximum for LFO -15Cu after 50 min visible light irradiation. 
The MO photodegradation performance of LFO -15Cu was promising when compared with 
literature (Wei,  Fan et al. 2012, Jung and Hong 2013, Nezamzadeh -Ejhieh and Moazzeni 
2013) , although note that the reaction conditions varied. For example, LFO -15 Cu removed > 
90% MO after 1 h visible light illumination under the conditions of temperature = 25 °C; initial 
dye concentration = 10 mg L-1; catalyst dosage = 0.8 g L-1; initial H 2O2 concentration = 0.3 g 
L-1; initial pH = 6. Under the similar conditions (temperature  = 30 °C; initial dye concentration 
= 10 mg L-1; dosage  = 0.75 g L-1; initial H 2O2 concentration =  0.5 mol L-1; initial pH = 6), the 
H3PW 12O40 supported Fe -bentonite (HPW -Fe-Bent) only degraded 78% MO after 1 h UV light 
irradiation (Wei, Fan et al. 2012) .  
Note that when no catalyst was added, the degradation of MO was only ~2% and 7% in the 
absence and presence of H 2O2 after 60 min visible light irradiation (Fig. 5.7a). This suggests 
that MO itself was hardly degraded by H 2O2 or light. In the other words, significant 
decolorization was observed und er visible light illumination when both LFO -15Cu and H 2O2 
was present, which implies LFO -15Cu as a heterogeneous visible -light-excited Fenton -like 
catalyst. Taken account of excellent photo -Fenton catalytic performance, LFO -15Cu was 
chosen for all the foll owing experiment.   
5.3.2.2. Proposed mechanism for MO degradation  
ESR spectroscopy was used to confirm the roles of •OH radicals in our experiments, with 
DMPO chosen as the scavenger of hydroxyl radicals which were generated during the photo -
Fenton reacti on. The same sample tube (size and type), DMPO concentration, and volume of 
DMPO adducts solution were used for all measurements; the intensity of EPR signals therefore 
depended only on the amount of •OH radicals.  Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

Fig. 5.9. (a) EPR spectra of DMPO -.OH adducts and (b) degradation of MO in the systems of 
LFO-15Cu/H 2O2/Dark, LFO -15Cu/H 2O2/Light and LFO/H 2O2/Light.  
As can be seen from Fig. 5.9a, four characteristic peaks of DMPO -OH adduct with the intensity 
of 1:2:2:1 were obser ved in LFO/H 2O2/Light, LFO -15Cu/H 2O2/Dark and LFO -
15Cu/H 2O2/Light, suggesting that hydroxyl radicals form in all three cases. The increase in 
signal intensity for LFO -15Cu/H 2O2/Light as compared to that for LFO -15Cu/H 2O2/Dark 
indicated that more •OH radica ls were generated when the system was illuminated by visible 
light than that in the dark condition. These results supported the suggestion that visible light 
irradiation enhanced the formation of hydroxyl radicals and thereby accelerated the photo -
Fenton d egradation of MO (as shown in Fig. 5.9b). For LFO/H 2O2/Light, the peak intensity of 
DMPO -OH adducts appeared weaker than for LFO -15Cu/H 2O2/Light when both were 
irradiated by visible light, indicating that LFO -15Cu enhanced the decomposition of H 2O2 to 
generate a larger amount of •OH radicals during the decolorization of MO. It was consistent 
with the observation in Fig. 5.9b, that the doping with Cu on LFO enhanced photocatalytic 
activity.  
On the basis of above results and literature review, the MO  degradation over LFO -15Cu likely 
occurred via two mechanisms as follows:  
(a) The first pathway is suggested as a heterogeneous Fenton -like catalytic mechanism (Li, 
Zhang et al. 2014) . In a typic al Fenton -like reaction, the commonly accepted mechanism is:  
≡FeIII + H 2O2 →  ≡FeII + HO 2•+ H+ (5.7) 
Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 ≡FeIII + HO 2•+ H+ → ≡FeII + O 2 + 2H+ (5.8) 
≡FeII + H 2O2 → ≡FeIII + •OH + OH- (5.9) 
Similarly to Fe, Cu also activated H 2O2 via the reactions as follows (Nichela, Berkovic et al. 
2013, Xu, Li et al. 2016) : 
≡CuII + H 2O2 → ≡CuI + H+ + HO 2• (5.10) 
≡CuII + HO 2•+ H+ → ≡CuI + O 2 + 2H+ (5.11) 
≡CuI + H 2O2 → ≡CuII + •OH + OH- (5.12) 
Photo -Fenton process is similar to the Fenton reaction, but also introduces light irradiation to 
improve the degradation. Under light illumination, the reduction of Fe(III) and Cu(II) can be 
accelerated, yielding additional reactive •OH (Eq s. (5.13) and  (5.14)), which can attack target 
organic (Herney -Ramirez, Vicente et al. 2010) .  
≡FeIII + OH-→  ≡FeIII(OH) + ℎ𝑣 → ≡FeII + •OH (5.13) 
≡CuII + OH-→  ≡CuII(OH) + ℎ𝑣 → ≡CuI + •OH (5.14) 
The partial substitution of Cu(II) into Fe(III) -site in LFO -15Cu not only  promoted the 
production of hydroxyl radicals but also led to the generation of more Fe(II) onto surface of 
the LFO -15Cu catalyst shown in Eq. ( 5.15) (Xu, Li et al. 2016) : 
≡FeIII + ≡CuI → ≡FeII + ≡CuII (5.15) 
(b) The sec ond pathway follows photocatalytic mechanism, in which LFO -15Cu absorbed the 
visible light and then underwent charge separation (Eq. ( 5.16)). Then the electrons were 
trapped by the H 2O2 to generate •OH (Eq. ( 5.17)) 
LFO-15Cu + h ʋ  → 𝑒𝑐𝑏− + ℎ𝑣𝑏+ (5.16) Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
91 
 H2O2 + 𝑒𝑐𝑏− → •OH + OH- (5.17) 
The electron -hole recombination  (Eq. ( 5.18)) needs to be minimized for producing •OH.  
𝑒𝑐𝑏− + ℎ𝑣𝑏+ → energy  (5.18) 
Finally, the generated •OH directly oxidized MO, as represented in Eq. ( 5.19): 
•OH + MO → Degradation products  (5.19) 
As shown in Fig. 5.7, the highest value of k was observed for LFO -15Cu among a number of 
undoped and Cu -doped samples, suggesting the fastest degradation rate and best photocatalytic 
activity. This can be explained by its high spe cific surface area and low band gap energy, 
accompanied with good crystallinity and small particle size. These features benefit suppression 
of election -hole recombination and generation of •OH radicals. Especially, a greater amount of 
•OH radicals would form  via the interaction of oxygen vacancies, wh ich was caused by the 
substitution of Fe(III) by Cu(II), and water molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface (Parrino, 
García -López et al. 2016) . Furthermore, Cu and oxygen vacancies might act as electron traps 
reducing recombination of electron and hole; and in turn enhancing photodegradation.  
5.3.3 Effects of parameters on MO degradation   
5.3.3.1 Effect of catalyst dose  
In Fig. 5.10, the photocatalytic efficiency of LFO -15Cu increased with increasing catalyst 
dosage up to 0.8 g L-1 and above that the degradation efficiency decreased. The observed 
apparent rate constant s k for MO degradation at the catalyst dosage of 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 g L-1 
were 0.0168, 0.0468, 0.0414, and 0.0217 min-1, respectively. A possible explanation is th at 
initially, the higher dosage of LFO -15Cu created more active sites and thus enhanced MO 
degradation. However, as the dosage increased further, an excessive amount of catalyst 
suppressed light penetration into the suspension, decreasing the photo -activat ion effect and in 
turn lowering the degradation rate.  Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

Fig. 5.10.  (a) Effect of catalyst dosage on photodegradation of MO (reaction conditions: 
temperature = 25 °C; initial dye concentration = 10 mg L-1; initial H 2O2 concentration = 0.3 g 
L-1; initial pH = 6; NaCl = 0 M) and (b) plots of -ln (C/C0) versus  irradiation time.  
5.3.2.3 Effect of initial pH  
It is well -known that the initial pH value has a great influence on the photo -Fenton reaction 
because pH controls the generation of hydroxyl radicals. The effect of initial pH on MO 
degradation is illustrated in Fig. 5.11.  
 
Fig. 5.11.  (a) Effect of init ial pH on photodegradation of MO (reaction conditions: temperature 
= 25 °C; initial dye concentration = 10 mg L-1; catalyst dosage = 0.8 g L-1; initial H 2O2 
concentration = 0.3 g L-1; NaCl = 0 M) and (b) plots of -ln (C/C0) versus  irradiation time.  
The percentage of MO removal via the photo -Fenton degradation decreased with increasing 
pH; this is consistent with the recent report (Nie, Zhang et al. 2015) . A maximum degradation 
rate of 92.9% was achieved when using LFO -15Cu at pH = 6; whilst the degradation rate 
Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
93 
 dropped to 85.9% at pH = 7 and 70.4% at pH = 8. The pseudo -first-order reaction rate constant 
k was found to be the highest (0.0468 min-1) at pH = 6; as compared with 0.0313, 0.0338, 
0.0346, and 0.0212 min-1 when at pH = 4, 5, 7, and 8, respectively. This could be explained by 
the form of MO existence which depends on the solution pH . In acidic solu tion, MO is in 
quinoid structure which is easier to be decomposed in comparison with that in azo structure 
formed at alkaline solution (Zhang, Wan et al. 2010) . The increase of sol ution pH is also 
detrimental to the Fenton -like degradation process due to the decomposition of hydrogen 
peroxide into water and oxygen (Wang 2008) . We found that the degradation rates of MO at 
pH 4 and 5 were both smaller than that at pH 6. This may be due to the fact that the catalyst’s 
active sites are unstable in a more acidic media an d copper just exhibits a dominant role in the 
Fenton reaction at pH > 4 (Zhang, Zhang et al. 2016) . On the other side, at the low pH, more 
H+ ions were generated that could react with hydroxyl radicals •OH, leading to the decrease of 
degradation efficiency (Zhang, Zhang et al. 2016) .  
5.3.3.2 Effect of H 2O2 concentration  
The effect of H 2O2 dosage on the degradation of MO was examined by varying the initial 
concentration from 0.1 to 0.5 g L-1, with the results shown in Fig. 5.12. As the H 2O2 
concentration was increased from 0.1 to 0.3 g L-1, the MO degradation rate also increased 
correspondingly from 78.8% to 92.9% with k increasing from 0.0260 to 0.0468 min-1, because 
of increasing hydroxyl radicals in the solution.  
 
Fig. 5.12.  (a) Effect of initial concentration of H 2O2 on photodegradation of MO (reaction 
conditions: temperature = 25 °C; initial dye concentration = 10 mg L-1; catalyst dosage = 0.8 g 
L-1; initial pH = 6; NaCl = 0 M); and (b) plots of -ln (C/C0) versus  irradiation time.  
Chapter 5                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
94 
 However, a decrease of MO degradatio n rate was observed when further increasing the 
concentration of H 2O2 to 0.5 g L-1. The pseudo -first-order reaction apparent rate constant k was 
found to attain an optimum value of 0.0468 min-1 in 0.3 g L-1 H2O2, and then decreased to 
0.0412 min-1 when the H 2O2 concentration rose up to 0.5 g L-1. This is probably due to the fact 
that at a high H 2O2 concentration, •OH radicals can react with H 2O2 to generate less reactive 
species such as hydroperoxyl radicals HO 2• (Nezamzadeh -Ejhieh and Moazzeni 2013) , 
following the reaction:  
H2O2 + •OH → H 2O + HO 2• (5.20) 
This reaction would compete with the dye degradation reaction, reduce the probability of MO 
attacked by •OH radicals and subsequently lower dye removal rate.  
5.3.3.3 Effect of co -existing ion on MO degradation  
The effect of co -existing ion on the photo -Fenton degradation of MO is presented in Fig. 5.13. 
As is well known, inorganic ion such as chloride (Cl-) is commonly present in the wastewater 
originated from  dyestuff and textile industries; thus, its effect on photodegradation of MO 
cannot be neglected. Taking account of the negligible effect of Na+ (Liu, Yu et al. 2011) , our 
results revealed that Cl- appeared to inhibit the MO removal by using LFO -15Cu. In the 
presence of 0.01 M Cl-, only 6 2.8% MO ( k = 0.0170 min-1) was removed, which was much 
lower than that (92.9%; k = 0.0468 min-1) when no Cl- was added in the dye -containing 
solution. Cl- might act as the scavenger of •OH and h+ (Eskandarloo, Badiei et al. 2014) , thus 
reducing the formation of hydroxy l radicals and lowering photodegradation efficiency. The 
presence of Cl- in the solution exhibited a negative impact on the photodegradation of MO.

concentration = 0.3 g L-1; initial pH = 6) and (b) plots of -ln (C/C0) versus  irradiat ion time.  
5.3.3.4 Stability and reusability of Cu -doped LFO  
The stability and reusability of LFO -15Cu was examined by reclaiming the catalyst after an 
initial MO degradation experiment, then using it as the catalyst with a fresh batch of MO, and 
repeating this for several times. The results are illustrated in Fig. 5.14.

cycling runs (reaction conditions: temperature = 25 °C; initial dye concentration = 10 mg L-1; 
initial H 2O2 concentration = 0.3 g L-1; catalyst dosage = 0.8 g L-1; initial pH = 6; NaCl = 0 M).  
LFO-15Cu demonstrated only a slight drop in removal efficiency of MO from 92.9% (1st run) 
to 88.5% (4th run), suggesting that it have good stability over repetitive photo -Fenton catalytic 
degradation of MO under visible lig ht illumination. It was further supported by the XRD and

 ICP-MS analysis. After finishing 4 cycles of photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of MO, the 
structure of LFO -15Cu was almost unchanged based on the XRD patterns (Fig. 5.15).

and spent LFO -15Cu after 4 cycles of photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of MO.  
The ICP -MS analysis showed only 1.558 mg L-1 La and 0.482 mg L-1 Cu (Table 5.4) in the 
solution after degradation test with little Fe observed, which suggests that metal leaching from 
the catalyst be negligible. Thus, LFO -15Cu was proven to be stable and reusable for MO 
degradation.

5.3.4 Evaluation of Cu -doped LFO on degradation of other dyes 
As can be seen above, excellent photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of MO was observed under 
the optimum conditions: 0.3 g L-1 H2O2 dosage and 0.  8 g L-1 catalyst loading at the initial 
solution pH 6. Under the same conditions, the photocatalytic performanc e of LFO -15Cu was 
also evaluated for the cationic dyes, RhB and MB.

Fig. 5.16.  Removal of MB, RhB and MO using LFO -15Cu  via adsorption, photolysis, 
oxidation by H 2O2 and photodegradation (reaction conditions: temperature = 25 °C, initial dyes 
concentration = 10 mg L-1; catalyst dosage = 0.8 g L-1, initial H 2O2 concentration = 0.3 g L-1; 
initial pH = 6; NaCl = 0 M).  
Seen from Fig. 5.16, negligible removal of dye was in duced by adsorption (3% for MO; 4.5% 
for MB; and 2% for RhB). Of these three dyes, MB showed the highest self -degradation and 
the oxidation by H 2O2 under visible light, with the decolorization rate of 26% and 65%, 
respectively (Fig. 5.16). On the other sid e, a limited amount of RhB and MO (˂ 6%) was 
removed in the processes which were initiated solely by using visible light or H 2O2. Our results 
showed that LFO -15Cu exhibited superior catalytic activity for the photodegradation of these 
dyes, with a removal rate of 99.4% for RhB, 98.8% for MB and 92.9% for MO (Fig. 5.16). The 
slightly lower photodegradation efficiency of MO might be attributed to its high chemical 
stability and low photosensitized property (Shi, Yan et al. 2012) . Similar observation was also 
reported in other studies (Wang, Cheng et al. 2015, Zhang and Ma 2017) .    
5.4. Conclusions  
Cu-doped LaFeO 3 (LaFe 1-xCuxO3) samples were prepared by a hydrothermal method and used 
as heterogeneous visible -light-driven Fenton -like catalysts for the degradation of methyl 
orange (MO) . The results showed that LFO-15Cu with a theoretical 15 mol% Cu doping was 
more effective than the sample of LaFeO 3 (LFO) in terms of MO decolo risation. Under visible 
light irradiation, the use of 0.8 g L-1 LFO -15Cu induced 92.9% of MO removal in 60 min at the 
initial H 2O2 concent ration of 0.3 g L-1 and initial pH of 6. The partial substitution of Cu into

98 
 LFO improved MO degradation rate by approximately 60%; which could be ascribed to the 
formation of more •OH radicals during the decolorization of MO . The encouraging data also 
indicated the high stability and reusability of LFO -15Cu; therefore, it shows great potential as 
a promising catalyst for organic pollutant removal in the field of wastewater treatment.

6.1 Introduction  
Advanced oxidation process (AOP) has been considered as an alternative and effective method 
in treating various industrial wastewater contamin ated by dyes and organics over the last few 
years. As one of the AOPs, the Fenton reaction using strong oxidant hydrogen peroxide to 
generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH) has attracted intensive research interest to 
remove a variety of recal citrant organic contaminants since the 1960s (Neyens and Baeyens 
2003) . Typically, the Fenton process is conducted in a homogeneous way using dissolved 
ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide as Fenton reagents. However, the application of the 
homogeneous Fenton process at industrial scale is limited due to: (i) pH -dependent chem ical 
reactivity of iron; (ii) difficulty and complexity in separation and recovery of metal ions from 
the final effluent (Carrasco -Díaz, Castillejos -Lópe z et al. 2016) . Therefore, research effort has 
directed towards designing heterogeneous iron -based Fenton -like catalysts, such as iron oxide 
(Rusevova, Kopinke  et al. 2012) , iron exchanged zeolite (Tekbaş, Yatmaz et al. 2008)  and iron 
supported porous material (Ramirez,  Maldonado -Hódar et al. 2007) . Combined with visible 
light irradiation, the cost -effectiveness of a heterogeneous Fenton -like process for use in 
wastewater treatment has been seen as promising (Chacón, Leal et al. 2006, Zheng, Pan et al. 
2007, Starling, dos Santos et al. 2017) .  
Perovskite materials having the generic formula of ABO 3, in which A is typically an alk aline -
earth or rare -earth element and B is a transition metal, have been found to exhibit high visible 
light photo -Fenton -like activity for dye degradation (Ju, Chen et al. 2011, An, Zhu et al. 2013, 
Ye, Yang et al. 2018) . Ju et al.  found that EuFeO 3 nanoparticles prepared by the sol -gel method Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 and calcined at 750 °C yielded 71% removal rate in 5 mg L-1 Rhodamine B (RhB) solution 
after being exposed to visible light for 3 h, in the presence of 1 g L-1 catalyst and 0.05 mL H 2O2 
(Ju, Chen et al. 2011) . An and co -workers investigated the use of BiFeO 3 heterogeneous photo -
Fenton -like catalyst synthesized by the sol -gel method on the degradation of RhB, Methyl 
Violet (MV) and phenol (An, Zhu et al. 2013) . Their results revealed that with the assistance 
of visible light irradiation, the RhB, phenol and MV degradation rate constant ( k), derived from 
the pseudo -first-order model, was increa sed by 1.95, 2.07 and 3.47 times, respectively, 
compared to that under the dark condition. The utilization of visible light enhanced the 
photocatalytic activity of BiFeO 3 for pollutant degradation in the presence of H 2O2. Ye and co -
workers have successfully prepared 15%g -C3N4/LaFeO 3 heterojunction photocatalyst for the 
degradation of 10 mg L-1 RhB (Ye, Yang et al. 2018) . The authors found that after 120 min, 
the RhB removal of the sam ple (97.4 %) in the photo -Fenton reaction  is higher than its 
photocatalytic (58.4%) and Fenton performance (37.2%).  
The literature suggests that LaFeO 3 (LFO), as a member of the group of perovskite materials, 
could be a promising heterogeneous catalyst in the photo -Fenton degradation of pollutants (Li, 
Wang et al. 2014, Nie, Zhang et al. 2015, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 
2018) . In the photo -Fenton reaction, the  pollutant is believed to be oxidized and degraded by 
the attack of the hydroxyl radicals; thereby it is necessary to increase the number of active sites 
on the catalyst surface and in turn enhance the contact area between the pollutant and the 
catalyst to wards the optimization of pollutant  removal. However, LFO crystals synthesized via 
the traditional sol -gel method normally possess small specific surface area, show no porosity 
and therefore have a limited amount of active sites for catalytic degradation (Rusevova, 
Köferstein et al. 2014, Nie, Zhang et al. 2015) , due to the high temperature usually used in the 
synthesis.  
So far, there has been some effort contributed to the development of supported LFO catalysts 
with porosity for high -performance Fenton or photo -Fenton degradation of pollutants. A  
number of materials have been explored for use as the supports, such as montmorillonite (Peng, 
Fu et al. 2016) , carbon spheres (Wang, Niu et al. 2017) , mesoporous silicas (Su, Jing et al. 
2010, Xiao, Hong et al. 2013) , and graphene (Ren, Yang et a l. 2016) . In particular, mesoporous 
silicas have received recent research interest because of their unique features, including high 
specific surface area, tunable pore size and structure (Nguyen, Szabo et al. 2002, Zhang, Xu et 
al. 2013, Zhao, Liu et al. 2013, Huang, Yu et al. 2015) . Zhu’s group successfully loaded LFO 
on SBA -15 mesoporo us silica and investigated its Fenton -like catalytic activity for the Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
101 
 oxidation of Rhodamine B (RhB), reactive brilliant red X -3B, direct scarlet 4BS and methylene 
blue (MB) (Xiao, Hong et al. 2013) . The results showed that 80% and 66% of RhB and MB 
was removed after 60 min, respectively; whilst that for 4BS and X -3B was similar, 
approximately 42% (test conditions: 1 mL of 30 wt%H 2O2, 0.1 g catalyst and 50 mL of 0.02 
mmol L-1 dye solution). It was also concluded that SBA -15-supported LFO was more efficient 
than the bulk LFO in the catalysin g oxidation of organic. Later the same group studied the role 
of silica, including porous (e.g. , SBA -15, SBA -16, MCF) and non -porous silica powders, on 
RhB oxidative degradation using the supported LFO (Li, Zhu et al. 2016) . Their results 
revealed that the LFO sample supported by MCF, which had randomly distributed pores and 
short pore length, exhibited the high est photocatalytic performance when compared to other 
LFO-doped samples. This suggests that the porous structure of the support plays an essential 
role in the adsorption of the organic, its transportation to active sites and eventually catalytic 
degradatio n (Li, Zhu et al. 2016) . However, there have been few publications, exploring the 
use of silica -supported LF O for enhanced photo -Fenton degradation of organics under visible 
light irradiation. There have been no reports of studies to optimize its catalytic performance 
under different operational conditions or to investigate its feasibility for recycle and reuse;  all 
of which is necessary information for practical utilization in wastewater treatment.  
In this work, a type of mesoporous silica (HPS), which showed a unique fine pore system, 
narrow inner channels and wide outer pore opening (Gai, Yang et al. 2012) , was selected as a 
support for different amounts of LFO doping to prepare heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like 
catalysts HPS -xLFO (with theoretical LFO/silica molar ratio x = 0.075, 0.15, 0.3). This unique 
mesoporous structure may endow great surface area for LFO doping and in turn would offer a 
large number of active sites. Meanwhile, its wider pore opening would gre atly reduce the 
resistance to large organic molecules being transported into the pores and reaching active sites 
for catalytic degradation. RhB, a representative of xanthane dyes, is widely used in a variety 
of industries (e.g. , textile, dyeing, paint and printing) and imposes hazardous effect on the 
environment and public health (Das, Bhowal et al. 2006, Merouani, Hamdaoui et al. 2010) . 
Although significant effort has been concentrated on the application of methods, inc luding 
adsorption (Gad and El -Sayed 2009) , membrane separation (Sachdeva and Kumar 2009) , ion 
flotation (Shakir, Elkafrawy et al. 2010)  and ozonation (Faryadi, Rahimi et al. 2016) , to remove 
RhB from water, they have to date been found to be ineffective or uneconomical due to the 
stability of dye (Merouani, Hamdaoui et al. 2010) . In this study, w e selected RhB as the model 
organic dye to investigate its removal effectiveness using HPS -xLFO via adsorption and photo -Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 Fenton catalytic degradation. The effect of catalyst dosage, H 2O2 concentration, solution pH 
and co -existing ions on the photo -Fenton r emoval of RhB was investigated; and its 
performance after recycling was also studied.         
6.2. Experimental  
6.2.1 Materials  
Cyclohexane (C 6H12; 99.9%), 1 -pentanol (CH 3(CH 2)4OH; 99%), cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (CH 3(CH 2)15N(Br)(CH 3)3; 99%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (Si(OC 2H5)4; 99%), 
lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO 3)3.6H 2O; 99.9%), citric acid (C 6H8O7.H2O; ≥99.5%), 
H2O2 (30 wt%), and Rhodamine B (RhB; ≥95%) were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich. Iron 
nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O; 98% – 101%) was purchased from Alta Aesar. Urea 
(NH 2CONH 2) was obtained from Merck Pty Limited, Australia. Other chemicals were from 
Biolab Ltd in Australia. All of the chemicals were used without additional purification.   
6.2.2 Preparation of porous silica 
Mesoporous silica (HPS -0LFO) support was synthesized according to a reported procedure 
(Gai, Yang et al. 2012) . First of all, 2.7 mL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was dissolved in 
the mixture with 1.5 mL 1 -pentanol and 30 mL cyclohexane at the room temperature. The 
resulting solution was stirred for 5 h, followed by the addition of a mixture which was made 
up o f 1.87 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 0.6 g urea, 30 mL deionized (DI) 
water. After stirring, the solution was transferred into a Teflon -lined autoclave (100 mL) and 
heated in an oven at 120 °C for 4 h. Finally, white precipitates were separated from the liquid, 
washed with acetone and DI water, dried in an oven and calcined in air at 550 °C for 6 h 
(heating rate of 1 °C min-1 from room temperature to 550°C).   
6.2.3 Synthesis of LaFeO 3-doped HPS  
LaFeO 3-doped mesoporous silica (HPS -xLFO) was synth esized by impregnation and 
subsequent calcination. Typically, 10 mmol La(NO 3)3.6H 2O, 10 mmol Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O and 20 
mmol citric acid was dissolved in a mixture of 10 mL DI water and 20 ml of ethanol to form a 
homogeneous solution at room temperature. After adding 2 g HPS -0LFO, the resulting 
suspension was stirred at room temperature for 3 h and then at 70 °C to evaporate the solvent, 
followed by drying at 80 °C and then calcination at 700 °C (heating rate of 5 °C min-1 from Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 room temperature to 700 °C). The t heoretical molar ratio between LaFeO 3 (LFO) and silica in 
different samples was 0.075, 0.15 and 0.3. The corresponding catalysts were designated as 
HPS-0.075LFO, HPS -0.15LFO, and HPS -0.3LFO, respectively. For comparison, the sample, 
which was synthesized f ollowing the same above procedures in the absence of HPS, was 
denoted as LFO.      
6.2.4 Sample characterization  
Powder X -ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed on a diffractometer (XRD, GBC 
eMMA), which was operated in the reflection mode with Cu  Kα radiation (28 mA, 35 kV) at a 
step size of 1° min-1 in the range of 10° – 80°. The surface morphology and elemental 
composition of each sample was characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 
(Zeiss 1555, VP -FESEM) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV with energy dispersive X -ray 
spectrometry (EDS). The samples were loaded onto the carbon tape and coated by platinum.  
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis was performed on TEM -TITAN operating 
at 200 kV. The samples were dispersed in eth anol under ultrasonication and loaded onto carbon 
copper grid for TEM characterization. Nitrogen adsorption -desorption isotherms were 
measured at 77 K using SAPA2010 (Micromeritics Inc., USA). The samples were degassed at 
200 °C overnight under vacuum.  
6.2.5 Removal of RhB from water 
100 mL of RhB aqueous solution (10 mg L-1) was introduced into a cylindrical Pyrex vessel 
(300 mL), surrounded by a circulating water jacket to maintain solution temperature at 25 °C. 
100 mg of HPS -xLFO (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0. 3) or 100 mg of LFO was added to the RhB 
solution; the resulting suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 90 min to investigate 
its adsorption of RhB in water. Samples were taken from the suspension at given period of 
times and centrifuged at 10 ,000 rpm. The obtained supernatant was analysed using a Perkin 
Elmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis spectrometer to determine the concentration of RhB ( Ci, mg L-1), 
compared to the initial concentration of RhB before adsorption ( C, mg L-1).  
The results showed that the  adsorption -desorption equilibrium was achieved within 30 min. 
Therefore, the photo -Fenton catalytic degradation test was started after 30 min dark adsorption 
using the catalyst. Typically, 100 mL of RhB aqueous solution (10 mg L-1) was introduced into 
a cylindrical Pyrex vessel (300 mL), surrounded by a circulating water jacket to maintain 
solution temperature at 25 °C. 100 mg of HPS -xLFO (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3) or LFO was Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
104 
 added to the RhB solution; the resulting suspension was magnetically stirred in th e dark for 30 
min to reach adsorption -desorption equilibrium. After that, a Xenon lamp (CEL -HX F300) 
with a 400 nm cut -off filter was used to provide visible light and 1 mL H 2O2 was added to the 
suspension to initiate the photo -Fenton -like reaction. Sample s were taken from the suspension 
at given periods of time and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm. The obtained supernatant was analysed 
using Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis spectrometer to determine the concentration of RhB 
(Ct, mg L-1), as compared with the concen tration of RhB before starting photo -Fenton -like 
degradation ( C0, mg L-1).  
The reusability of the catalyst was assessed by repeating the photo -Fenton degradation test 
under the same reaction conditions after recovering HPS -0.15LFO from the solution.   
6.3. Results and discussion  
6.3.1 Characterization of HPS -xLFO  
The general morphologies of HPS -xLFO (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3) with different LFO loadings 
are presented in Fig. 6.1. The sample of HPS -0LFO exhibited monodispersed spheres with a 
particle diame ter of ~ 300  – 400 nm. The morphology of LFO -loaded HPS (HPS -0.075LFO, 
HPS-0.15LFO, and HPS -0.3LFO) was similar to that of HPS -0LFO, suggesting that the HPS 
support is stable during doping with LFO. No significant LFO crystals or clumps were seen 
separatel y from the particles of HPS -xLFO (x = 0.075, 0.15, 0.3).

0.15LFO; (d) HAADF scanning TEM image of HPS -0.15LFO and (e) the corresponding 
elemental mapping (Si, O, La, and Fe).  
The morphology and size of HPS and HPS -0.15LFO observed by TEM (Fi g. 6.2 a and b) are 
consistent with those in Fig. 6.1. In Fig. 6.2a, the particles of HPS -0LFO exhibited a unique 
mesoporous structure. Compared with Fig. 6.2a, the TEM image of HPS -0.15LFO (Fig. 6.2b) 
shows that some small particles (e.g. , indicated in red) were loaded in the HPS support. These 
particles were observed with an interplanar distance of 0.278 nm (Fig. 6.2c), which corresponds 
to the (121) crystal plane of LFO (Wei, Guo et al. 2017) . The high -angle -annular dark -field 
(HAADF) scanning TEM image of HPS -0.15LFO (Fig. 6.2d), and the corresponding elemental 
mapping images (Fig. 6.2e) further confirm that LFO was loaded to the HPS support.  
The XRD patterns of HPS -xLFO (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3) are shown in Fig. 6.3; the XRD 
pattern of LFO synthesized without the use of HPS was included for comparison. A broad 
characteristic peak at 2 θ = 23o was observed for the amorphous mesoporous SiO 2, HPS -0LFO. 
As expected, the LFO loading affected the porous structure of the HPS support. The 
characteristic peak intensity of SiO 2 considerably decreased with increased LFO loading in 
HPS, which is probably due to the partial or complete filling of LFO inside the HPS pores. The 
samples of HPS -0.075LFO, HPS -0.15LFO, and HPS -0.3LFO exhibited the characteristic 
diffraction peaks indexable to the orthorhombic structure of LFO (JCPDS No. 37 -1493) 
(Cha ndradass and Kim 2010) . No apparent characteristic peaks of impurities were detected, 
confirming the high purity of the samples.

 Fig. 6.3. XRD patterns of HPS -xLFO (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3) as compared with that of LFO.  
The nitrogen adsorption -desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution curves of HPS -
xLFO (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3) are shown in Fig. 6.4. The N 2 adsorption -desorption isotherm 
curves of all samples showed a type IV isotherm with H2 -hysteresis loops ( Fig. 6.4a), which 
suggests the characteristic of mesoporous structure (Gai, Yang et al. 2012) . It can be se en from 
Fig. 6.4b that HPS possessed a broad pore size distribution with multimodal mesopores ranging 
from 15 nm to 30 nm. It is worth noting that the high BET surface area of 496.62 m2 g-1 was 
recorded for HPS -0LFO; whereas that of HPS -xLFO (x = 0.075, 0. 15, 0.3) was considerably 
reduced from 349.52 m2 g-1 to 123.12 m2 g-1 as the theoretical molar ratio of LFO loading to 
silica increased from 0.075 to 0.3. The pore volume of HPS -xLFO showed a similar trend, from 
2.34 cm3 g-1 (HPS -0LFO), 1.22 cm3 g-1 (HPS -0.075LFO), 0.47 cm3 g-1 (HPS -0.15LFO) to 0.27 
cm3 g-1 (HPS -0.3LFO). The decrease of BET surface area and total pore volume accompanied 
with the increase of LFO loading could be attributed to the presence of LFO in the pores and 
channels of the HPS su pport. These results suggest that LFO was successfully incorporated 
into the mesopores of HPS. A low BET surface area of 8.06 m2 g-1 was observed for the LFO 
sample synthesized without the use of a HPS support. As can be seen, the LFO -doped HPS 
samples exh ibited much higher specific surface area  than the  sample of pure LFO without HPS, 
and presented accessible pores  which provided  more active sites and pathways for RhB 
removal.

Fig. 6.6 presents the bandgap values  of LFO and HPS -xLFO (x = 0.075, 0.15, 0.3). They were

F(R) is the Kubelka -Munk function and hν is the energy of the incident photon (shown in the 
inset of Fig. 6.5). The corresponding bandgap was 2.21 eV, 2.31 eV, and 2 .34 eV, respectively, 
for HPS -0.075LFO, HPS -0.15LFO, HPS -0.3LFO, which was narrower as compared with 2.36 
eV for LFO. In the literature, Perathoner and co -workers also reported the improved 
effectiveness of light absorption of SBA15 -supported TiO 2, relativ e to TiO 2 (Perathoner, 
Lanzafame et al. 2006) .

6.3.2 Adsorptive removal of RhB using HPS -xLFO  
The photo -Fenton degradation  of RhB generally takes place on the surface of catalyst; therefore 
the RhB adsorption capability of LFO or HPS-xLFO  (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3 ) is expected to 
affect its photocatalytic performace (Zhao, Wu et al. 1998, Li and Ye 2007, Dong, Lee et al. 
2010, Li, Zhu et al. 2016) . Fig. 6.7a shows the adsorptive removal of RhB using LFO and HPS -
xLFO (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3) , which was conducted in the dark for 90 min. Fig. 6.7b reveals 
the RhB adsorption capacity of the samples as a function of time.

0.3) (reaction conditions: temperature = 25 °C; initial RhB concentration = 10 mg L-1; catalyst 
dosage = 1 g L-1; pH = 6); (b) the corresponding RhB adsorption capacity.  
The adsorption kinetics were not in good agreement with the pseudo -first-order model, as 
revealed by the low values of R2 (R2 = 0.8161 – 0.9862) in Table 6.1. On the other side, high 
correlation coefficients ( R2 = 0.9661 – 0.9998 ; Table 6.1) of the linear plots suggest the good 
agreement of the kinetic data with the pseudo -second -order model, which indicates the process

 is mainly chemisorption.  Because of an abundance of silanol groups (Si -OH) on the surface of 
mesoporous silica (Kruk, Jaroniec et al. 1997, Rosenholm, Czuryszkiewicz et al. 2007)  and 
carboxyl groups of RhB molecules, a hydrogen bond might be established between the 
functional groups of the silica support and RhB  (Liao, Ismael et al. 2012) .

order and pseudo -second -order , respectively  (Ho and McKay 1998, Lin and Wang 2009) . 
As shown above, the HPS -xLFO (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3) samples exhibited better adsorption 
capability of RhB than LFO. This might be ascribed to their structural properties (specific 
surface area and por osity), which were seen in the SEM, TEM and nitrogen adsorption -
desorption characterization. The porous structure of the HPS support (HPS -0LFO) was 
observed in the SEM and TEM images (Fig. 6.1 and 2), which could offer more space and 
pathways to facilitate  the adsorption of RhB as compared with LFO solid crystals. Moreover, 
mesoporous silica material has an abundance of silanol groups (Si -OH) on the surface (Kruk, 
Jaroniec et al. 1997, Rosenholm, Czuryszkiewicz et al. 2007) ; whilst RhB molecules contain 
carboxyl groups. A hydrogen bond might be established between the functional groups of the 
HPS support and RhB (Liao, Malik Ismael  et al. 2012) , which would translate into higher RhB 
adsorption by HPS -xLFO than by LFO. HPS -0LFO exhibited the highest adsorption capacity 
as compared to other LFO -doped HPS samples (HPS -0.075LFO, HPS -0.15LFO and HPS -
0.3LFO); since the doping of LFO in to the HPS support reduced specific surface area, pore 
volume and number of surface silanol groups. The BET surface area and pore volume of the 
catalysts changed in a trend of HPS -0LFO > HPS -0.075LFO > HPS -0.15LFO > HPS -0.3LFO. 
This is consistent with the obtained results for RhB adsorption capability.  Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 6.3.3 Photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of RhB using HPS -xLFO   
To evaluate  the photo -Fenton -like catalytic activity of HPS -xLFO (x = 0, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3) , the 
degradation of RhB in the presence of H 2O2 under visible light irradiation was carried out. The 
data were fitted with the pseudo -first-order kinetic model and the apparent rate constant was 
obtained from the slope of the straight line by plotting -ln(Ct/C0) as a function of time.   
 
Fig. 6.8. Chan ge of RhB concentration in different systems: RhB/Light (the solution with RhB 
under visible light), RhB/H 2O2/Light (the solution with RhB and H 2O2 under visible light), 
RhB/HPS -0.15LFO/Light (the solution with RhB solution and HPS -0.15LFO under visible 
light) and RhB/HPS -0.15LFO/H 2O2/Dark (the solution with RhB solution, H 2O2 and HPS -
0.15LFO in dark).  
Fig. 6.8 reveals no change in Ct/C0 in the absence of catalyst and H 2O2, implying that RhB does 
not be self decompose under visible light irradiation . Without the use of catalyst, approximately 
7% of RhB was removed in the presence of H 2O2 and visible light. A limited amount of RhB 
(~5%) was removed using just the catalyst of HPS -0.15LFO and exposure to visible light 
source. As compared with the results in Fig. 6.9, the use of H 2O2 is indispensible for the 
efficient removal of RhB from wate r when using the as -prepared catalyst herein.  
Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

Fig. 6.9. (a) Removal of  RhB in the photo -Fenton reaction using LFO or HPS -xLFO (x = 0.075, 
0.15, and 0.3)  and (b) corresponding degradation rate constants (reaction conditions: 
temperature = 25 °C, initial dye concentration = 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 1 g L-1, initial 
H2O2 concentration = 10 mM and initial pH = 6).  
The photo -Fenton -like catalytic degradation of RhB using HPS -0.075LFO was 72.1%, which 
was slightly lower than that using LFO, which was 88.6%. The pseudo -first-order reaction 
constant of HPS -0.075LFO and HPS -0LFO was 0.0174 min-1 and 0.0215 min-1, respect ively. 
The relatively lower degradation performance of HPS -0.075LFO might be explained by the 
small loading of LFO into the HPS support resulting in fewer active sites available for 
degradation. When the molar ratio of LFO loading and silica was increased to 0.15 the RhB 
degradation efficiency of HPS -0.15LFO reached 97.5%, with the pseudo -first-order reaction 
rate constant 0.0423 min-1. However, when using HPS -0.3LFO, the degradation efficiency was 
reduced slightly to 95.9% (the pseudo -first-order reaction rate constant was 0.0327 min-1). This 
could be attributed to excess LFO partially covering or blocking the pores in the HPS support; 
as a result, the transport of organic into pores and subsequently its degradation was hindered.  
Note that, the use of HPS -0.15LFO and HPS -0.3LFO resulted in better removal of RhB (97.5% 
and 95.9%, respectively) than LFO (88.6% ) in the photo -Fenton degradation . In particular, the 
theoretical molar ratio of LFO/silica in HPS -0.15LFO and HPS -0.3LFO was 0.15 and 0.3. No 
degradati on of RhB was found when using the HPS support (HPS -0LFO) as the catalyst, 
suggesting the support plays no role in degradation reaction. That implies that for the same 
dosage of catalyst, the actual amount of LFO in the doped HPS participating in the react ion 
was much smaller but its acitvity was more efficient, as compared with the bulk LFO crystals. 
On the other side, the RhB adsorption using HPS -0.15LFO or HPS -0.3LFO was noticeable in 
Fig. 6.7, in contrast to the negligible adsorption using the bulk LFO crystals. This suggests that 
Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 both of the LFO -doped catalysts could adsorb RhB from solution onto the silica support and 
guarantee the degradation to occur smoothly on the LFO active sites (Li, Zhu et al. 2016) .  
As can be seen above, the plain silica support HPS -0LFO could remove RhB to some level, 
mainly governed by adosprtion ( ~65% shown in Fig. 6.7a). So far, various methods, including 
biological, physical and chemical ways, have been widely explored to remove organics and 
dyes from water. Adsorption, as a traditional method, only transfers dyes from water to another 
phase. It normally requires fur ther treatment of saturated adsorbents after adsorption, e.g. , 
disposal or regeneration. For example, in the case of this study, the use of high temperature 
(normally ˃ 500 °C) or organic solvent would be needed to regenerate dye -saturated adsorbents 
for recycle and reuse (Wang, Li et al. 2006, Qin, Yang et al. 2018) , which may add further cost 
and complexity to the process. Advanced oxidation process (AOPs) have shown advantageous 
features as compared with adsorption. Especially, the heterogenous A OPs (e.g. , photo -Fenton) 
has demonstrated promising results for degradation of dyes to produce more biologically 
degradable and less toxic substances (Wang, Tadé et al. 2015) . In our study, the use of LFO 
doping onto HPS (e.g. , HPS-0.15LFO) could achieve much better total removal rate of RhB 
(over 98%), as compared to only <75% using the parent HPS -0LFO. Note that, the regeneration 
process herein is simple and capable for scale -up; especially it required no high temperature 
calcination and organic solvent (the results of recycle and reuse were shown in 6.3.4.5). The 
photo -Fenton catalytic performance in terms of dye removal using HPS -0.15LFO was almost 
completely retained after 4 cycles of use.  
Our work also compared the photo -Fenton catalytic performance of HPS -0.15LFO with that of 
Fe2O3-doped HPS using our H PS support (under the same molar ratio of loading). However, 
the preliminary results found that the degradation rate of plain Fe 2O3 or its doped HPS was ˂ 
70%, thus lower than that of HPS -0.15LFO. More systematic study is undertaken to reveal the 
reasons.  
As discussed above, HPS -0.15LFO exhibited the greatest reaction rate constant,  best 
degradation performance and highest removal efficiency, among the samples of LFO -doped 
HPS, HPS support and LFO pure crystals. Therefore, we selected HPS -0.15LFO to study the 
effects of catalyst dosage, H 2O2 centration, initial pH and co -existing ions on photo -Fenton 
degradation of RhB.  
Interestingly, in the dark, HPS -0.15LFO yielded a degradation rate of 66.5% (Fig. 6.8), 
revealing that HPS-0.15LFO can act as a heterogene ous Fenton -like catalyst (Li, Zhu et al. Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 2016) . With the use of visible light, the degradation of RhB was significantly enhanced, up to 
97.5%, strongly suggesting that the combination of HPS-0.15LFO  catalyst, H 2O2 and visible 
light is necessary to achieve efficient and effective removal of RhB .   
6.3.4 Effect of operational parameters on photo-Fenton using HPS -0.15LFO  
6.3.4.1 Effect of catalyst dosage  
The impact of HPS -0.15LFO dosage on the RhB degradation was assessed in Fig. 6.10a. The 
increase of HPS -0.15LFO dosage from 0.5 g L-1 to 1.0 g L-1 led to the enhancement of 
degradation from 94.8% to 97.5%; whereas the degradation efficiency decreased to 96.1% 
when further increasing HPS -0.15LFO dosage up to 1.2 g L-1. As can be seen clearly from Fig. 
6.10b that the pseudo -first-order reaction rate c onstant k at different dosages followed the 
order: 0.5 g L-1 < 0.8 g L-1 < 1.2 g L-1 < 1 g L-1. This can be explained by the increasing number 
of active sites for RhB degradation. However, further increase of catalyst dosage may limit the 
visible light tra nsmission into the reaction suspension, and in turn lower visible light utilization 
and reduce photo -Fenton degradation efficiency. Therefore, 1 g L-1 was identified as the 
optimal catalyst dosage for photo -Fenton degradation of RhB using HPS -0.15LFO in ou r 
experiment.

concentration = 10 mg L-1, initial H 2O2 concentration = 10 mM and initial pH = 6).  
6.3.4.2 Effect of H 2O2 concentration  
Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 In the photo -Fenton -like catalytic degradation, H 2O2 concentration has a great influence on the 
degradation of organic pollutants due to the fact that the amount of generated  •OH radicals is 
governed by the concentration of H 2O2 (Feng, Hu et al. 2003) . The photo -Fenton catalytic 
degradation of RhB using HPS -0.15LFO in the presence of various concentrations of H 2O2 is 
presented in Fig. 6.11a. It was observed that as the H 2O2 concentration increased  from 10 mM 
to 15 mM, the degradation efficiency of RhB was enhanced, reaching to 98.6%. However, 
further increase in H 2O2 concentration did not considerably improve the degradation efficiency. 
The RhB degradation efficiency was 97.9% for the H 2O2 concentr ation was 20 mM and this 
rate then decreased to 95.7% when increasing the H 2O2 concentration up to 25 mM. The fittings 
of photo -Fenton catalytic degradation data in Fig. 6.11b illustrate that the pseudo -first-order 
reaction rate constants k for RhB degrada tion in 10 mM, 15 mM, 20 mM, and 25 mM H2O2 
were 0.0423 min-1, 0.0544 min-1, 0.0486 min-1, and 0.0380 min-1, respectively.

degradation rate constants (reaction conditions: temperature = 25 °C, initial dye concentration 
= 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 1 g L-1 and initial pH = 6).  
It might be attributed to the scavenging  effect because of excess H 2O2, as shown in Eq. (6.1) 
(Feng, Hu et al. 2003) : 
H2O2 + •OH → H 2O + HO 2• (6.1) 
At high concentration of H 2O2, H 2O2 could act as a •OH radical scavenger, resulting in the 
reduced number of •OH radicals. Moreover, the generated HO 2• would be less reactive than 
•OH (Molina, Martínez et al. 2006) ; as a result, the RhB degradation efficiency decreased. The 
Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
115 
 optimal H 2O2 concentration for the photo -Fenton degradation of RhB using HPS -0.15LFO was 
found to be 15 mM.             
6.3.4.3 Effect of initial pH  
The effect of initial solution pH on the degr adation of RhB is presented in Fig. 6.12a. The 
experiment was conducted in the pH range of 4 – 9. Since textile industry  wastewater is nearly 
neutral to slightly acidic (Arslan -Alaton, Tureli et al. 2009) , the optimal pH in the photo -
Fenton -like degradation of RhB using HPS -0.15LFO is of importance to determine cost 
effective ness of process.  
 
Fig. 6.12. (a) Effect of initial solution pH on the removal of RhB in the photo -Fenton reaction 
and (b) degradation rate constants (reaction conditions: temperature = 25 °C, initial dye 
concentration = 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 1 g L-1 and H 2O2 concentration = 15 mM).  
As reported in the literature (Gan and Li 2013, Gao, Gan et al. 2013) , the low degradation% of 
RhB at high pH might be attributed to the decomposition of H 2O2 into less reactive 
hydroperoxyl radicals and the restriction of •OH production in a basic medium. Moreov er, in a 
solution with pH ˃ 3.7 (pKa of RhB), RhB presents in zwitterionic form (Merouani, Hamdaoui 
et al. 2010) . At high pH, the zwitterionic form of RhB tends to form bigger molecules (Wang, 
Qi et al. 2017) , which might hinder the  transport and entry of dye molecules into the pores of 
HPS-15LFO. In addition, the zwitterionic form of RhB molecules at high pH are less attackable 
by •OH radicals (Merouani, Hamdaoui et al. 2010) . These ef fects could explain the decrease in 
the degradation of RhB which was observed at high pH (e.g. , pH ˃ 6). Fig. 6.12b shows that 
the pseudo -first-order reaction rate constant k was the highest (0.0544 min-1) at pH = 6; as 
compared with 0.0404 min-1, 0.0346 m in-1 and 0.0287 min-1 at pH = 7, 8 and 9, respectively. 
The maximum degradation efficiency of RhB (98.6%) was observed at pH = 6.

 Note that the RhB degradation rate gradually decreased as the initial solution pH was reduced 
from 6 down to 4. Fig. 6.12b shows that t he pseudo -first-order reaction rate constant k was 
0.0369 min-1 and 0.0437 min-1, respectively at pH = 4 and 5; which was smaller than that at pH 
= 6 (0.0544 min-1), but still comparable or greater than those at pH  ˃ 6. Fig. 6.13 shows  the 
pHpzc determination of HPS -15LFO using  the pH drift method . The black curve indicates the 
plotting of measured final pH against initial pH; whilst the red curve presents pH initial = pH final. 
The pH at which two curves intersect is taken as pH pzc, which was 6.3 9 (Singh, Raizada et al. 
2014, Kim, Huling et al. 2015, Bechambi, Jlaiel et al. 2016) .  
 
Fig. 6.13. pHpzc of the HPS -0.15LFO sample using the pH drift method.  
When the solution pH was below the pH pzc, the surface of HPS -15LFO was p ositively charged; 
and above the pH pzc, the surface was negatively charged. As the proton concentration increased 
at lower pH, RhB could be protonated to RhBH+ under the acidification with H+ (Wang and 
Chu 2011) . The positively charged surfaces of HPS -0.15LFO might inhibit the adsorption of 
dye due to the repulsive force (Wang and Chu 2011) , resulting in the observed slight decrease 
of degradation rate.  
6.3.4.4 Effect of co -existing anions  
As is well known, some of inorganic ions, including NO 3-, SO 42- and Cl-, are common 
coexisting ions with dyes in real wastewater originated from dyestuf f industries, which might 
affect the degradation of RhB using HPS -0.15LFO.  
Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
117 
  
Fig. 6.14. (a) Effect of co -existing anions on removal of RhB in the photo -Fenton degradation 
and (b) degradation rate constants (reaction conditions: temperature = 25 °C, initial dye 
concentration = 10 mg L-1, catalyst dosage = 1 g L-1, H 2O2 concentration = 15 mM, pH = 6, 
NaCl, NaNO 3 or Na 2SO 4= 0.1 M).  
In Fig. 6.14a, the coexistence of NO 3- ion could slightly improve the degradation efficiency. 
Similar results were also rep orted by previous studies (Wang, Zhu et al. 2012, Gao, Zhang et 
al. 2015) . The pseudo -first-order reaction rate constant k was 0.0702 min-1 in the presence of 
0.1 M NaNO 3. This may be explained by the photolysis of NO 3- to produce hydroxyl radicals  
via the following reactions (Chu and Anastasio 2003, Zhang, Wang et al. 2005) : 
NO 3- + hυ → [NO 3-]* (6.2) 
[NO 3-]* → NO 2• + O-• (6.3)  
O-• + H 2O → •OH + OH-  (6.4) 
The presence of Cl- and SO 42- showed an inhibitory effect on the RhB photo -Fenton catalytic 
degradation using HPS-0.15LFO . The pseudo -first-order reaction rate constant k was 0.0413 
and 0.0280 min-1 when NaCl or Na 2SO 4 was added, in comparison of 0. 0544 min-1 in the 
absence of coexisti ng ions. Eskandaloo et al. reported that Cl- could act as an effective 
scavenging agent of holes and/or hydroxyl radicals (Eskandarloo, Badiei et al. 2014) , thus 
lowering photo -Fenton -like catalytic degradation efficiency. This result is also in a good 
agreement with th e literature (Liang, Li et al. 2008) . Similarly, the inhibitory effect of SO 42- on 
the degradation was suggested by Konstantinou and co -workers that SO 42- react with h+ and 
•OH to form less reactive species SO 4•-  (eqn (6.5) and (6.6)) (Konstantinou and Albanis  2004) : 
Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
118 
 SO 42- + h+ → SO 4•- (6.5) 
SO 42- + •OH → SO 4•- + OH- (6.6) 
On the other side, the competitive adsorption could more or less contribute to the observed 
reduction of degradation  rates. SO 42-, as the double charged anion, might be easier to adsorb 
on the surface of HPS -0.15LFO as compared to NO 3- and Cl-, which potentially blocked more 
active site and in turn reduced degradation rate more significantly (Wang, Zhu et al. 2012) . The 
large molecular size of SO 42- might also enhance steric hindrance and reduce the contact of 
RhB with HPS -0.15LFO.  Consequently, the degradation efficiency appeared slightly lower in 
the presence of SO 42- as compared with Cl-. 
6.3.4.5 Stability and reusability  
To study the stability and reusability of HPS -0.15LFO, it was collected after the photo -Fenton 
catalytic reaction and reused in a subsequent reaction cycle. As illustrated in Fig. 6.15a, no 
significant loss of photocatalytic activity was seen within four cycles of photo -Fenton catalytic 
degradation. The XRD patterns of HPS -0.15LFO before and after four cycles of RhB 
degradation (in Fig. 6.15b) show no noticeable difference. These suggest that HP S-0.15LFO 
can be effectively recycled and reused repetitively without significant reduction in catalytic 
activity. The ICP -MS analysis showed that the concentration of La and Fe in the solution after 
degradation was 4.67 mg L-1 and 0.064 mg L-1, respectively. The negligible concentration of 
dissolved ion detected implied that no significant contribution of homogeneous photo -Fenton 
reaction occurred. A slightly higher amount of dissolved La was detected; however, it did not 
play an essential role  in contributing to catalytic degradation of RhB. The above results, 
including recycling use and XRD characterization, suggest the catalyst HPS -0.15LFO 
possessed good stability and reusability, thereby showing great potential for practical use in 
removing dyes and organics from wastewater.  Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

before photo -Fenton -like catalytic degradation of RhB and the spent HPS -0.15LFO after four 
cycles of photo -Fenton -like catalytic degradation of RhB.  
6.3.4.6 Reaction mechanism  
A possible mechanism  for the photo -Fenton -like reaction using HPS -0.15LFO was proposed, 
as follows:  
≡FeIII + H 2O2 → ≡FeIIIH2O2   (6.7) 
≡FeIIIH2O2 → ≡FeII + HO 2• + H+ (6.8) 
≡FeIII + HO 2•+ H+ → ≡FeII + O 2 + 2H+ (6.9) 
≡FeII + H 2O2 → ≡FeIII + •OH + OH- (6.10) 
HPS-0.15LFO + h ʋ → 𝑒𝑐𝑏− + ℎ𝑣𝑏+ (6.11) 
H2O2 + 𝑒𝑐𝑏− →•OH + OH- (6.12) 
dye + hυ → dye* (6.13) 
dye + ℎ𝑣𝑏+ → dye+ (6.14) 
Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
120 
 •OH + dye (or dye+) → Degradation products  (6.15) 
It is commonly accepted that the interfacial Fe atoms (denoted as ≡FeIII) of perovskite -based 
catalysts can activate H 2O2 to form hydroxyl radicals (•OH) during the Fenton -like reaction 
(Eq. (6.7)-(6.10)) (Ju, Chen et al. 2011, Li, Wang et al. 2013) . The •OH radical is considered 
as a strong oxidizing agent because of its standard redox potential (+ 2.8V), which could 
oxidize most of the dyes to the mineral end -products (Konstantinou and Albanis 2004) . 
Meanwhile, HPS -0.15LFO can absorb visible light to produce photogenerated electron -hole 
pairs (Eq. (6.11)) (Yang, Hu et al. 201 6); the electron is trapped by H 2O2 to generate highly 
reactive •OH (Eq. (6.12)) and the hole is also an important active species to directly mineralize 
organic (Eq. (6.14)) (Li, Wang et al. 2013) . Note that the role of ℎ𝑣𝑏+ in oxidation process of 
organics has so far remained inconclusive (Wang, Tadé et al. 2015) . Some studies speculated 
that ℎ𝑣𝑏+ could activate dye*, which was formed after light absorption of dye (Eq. (6.13)), into 
dye+ (Eq. (6.14)); dye+ or dye was then oxidized by •OH radical (Eq. (6.15)) (Li, Wang et al. 
2013, Soltanabadi, Jou rshabani et al. 2018) . 
To investigat e the mechanism for photo -Fenton -like degradation over HPS -0.15LFO, the effect 
of active species, such as hole ( ℎ𝑣𝑏+) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH), in the process was explored. 
Ethanol and ammonium oxalate (AO) were selected for use as the scavengers of •OH and ℎ𝑣𝑏+ 
in the trapping experiment, respectively (Daneshvar, Salari et al. 2003, Meng, Li  et al. 2011) . 
Fig. 6.16 shows that w hen AO was introduced, no significant change was observed in the 
photo -Fenton catalytic RhB degradation. However, when ethanol was added into the reaction 
solution, the 90 -min RhB degradation efficiency was suppressed to only 47.3%. It suggests that 
•OH pl ay a more significant role in the photo -Fenton -like catalytic RhB degradation using HPS -
0.15LFO.   Chapter 6                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

Fig. 6.16. Effect of ethanol and AO on the photo -Fenton -like catalytic degradation of RhB over 
HPS-0.15LFO (reaction conditions: temperature = 25 °C, initial dye concentration = 10 mg L-
1, catalyst dosage = 1 g L-1, H 2O2 concentration = 15 mM, pH = 6).  
6.4. Conclusions  
The catalyst LaFeO 3 supported by mesoporous silica (HPS) was successfully synthesized by 
the method of impregnation and subsequent calci nation. The characterization results showed 
that the sample of HPS -0.15LFO with a theoretical LFO/silica molar ratio of 0.15 exhibited 
great surface area and a narrow bandgap. It exhibited higher total removal rate of RhB (98.9%) 
from water compared to the  others with different loadings of LFO; which was contributed to 
dark adsorption (18.5% in 30 min) and photo -Fenton degradation (98.6% in 90 min in the 
presence of 15 mM H 2O2, 0.1 g catalyst and pH of 6). The optimum operational conditions for 
photo -Fenton  degradation using HPS-0.15LFO were found to be: RhB concentration = 10 mg 
L-1, catalyst dosage = 1 g L-1, pH = 6 and H 2O2 = 15 mM. It is suggested that in this reaction, 
the hydroxyl radicals were the main active species. The high degradation efficiency, good 
reusability and stability may enable promising industrial application of HPS -0.15LFO as a 
visible -light-driven photo -Fenton -like catalyst for removal of organic from wastewater.

Enhanced removal of organic using LaFeO 3-integrated modified natural zeolites via 
heterogeneou s visible light photo -Fenton degradation

7.1 Introduction  
Nowadays, along with the development of dye production and application, many industries are 
discharging tens of thousands of tons of dyes annually into waterways, which may be toxic, 
carcinogenic or mutagenic, with negative effect on the ecosystem and huma n health (Vanhulle, 
Trovaslet et al. 2007, Chequer, de Oliveira et al. 2013) . The treatment of dye -containing 
wastewater bef ore discharge into environment is therefore of significant importance.  
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as photo -oxidation and photo -Fenton have been 
studied as candidates to eliminate various organic pollutants from wastewater  (Heidari, Varma 
et al. 2019) . In particular, the use of heterogeneous catalyst in AOPs has attracted increasing 
research interest (Kasiri, Alebo yeh et al. 2008, Aleksić, Kušić et al. 2010, Jin, Zhou et al. 2018) . 
A heterogeneous photo -Fenton process using metal -oxide semiconductors as catalysts  has 
shown a number of benefits, such as complete mineralization of organics, cost effectiveness, 
capability for reuse and good chemical stability (Phan, Nikoloski et al. 2018, Phan, Nikoloski 
et al. 2018) . The use of visible light as a light source instead of ultraviolet light in the 
heterogeneous photo -Fenton process has been investigated, as it addresse s environmental 
concerns as well as could reduce energy and cost  (Ohshiro, Chiyoda et al. 2006) .  
One type of perovskite, LaFeO 3 (LFO) , has versatile and advantageous physicochemical 
properties that have attracted interest in its use as a cost -effective and nontoxic catalyst in AOPs 
to degrade a wide range of organic pollutants (Wang, Niu et al. 2017, Phan, Nikoloski et al. 
2018, Garcia -Muñoz, Lefevre et al. 2019) . However, perovskites prepared by conventional 
methods, e.g. , sol-gel method, solution combustion, co -precipitation, etc., often have low 
specific surface area and large particle size, which result in low contact e fficiency and activity Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 with organics and therefore limit their effectiveness (Su, Jing et al. 2010, Margellou, Papadas 
et al. 2016) . Many attempts have been made to overcome this by immobilizing the perovskites  
onto/into suitable supports, such as montmorillonite (Peng, Fu et al. 2016) , SBA -16 (Su, Jing 
et al. 2010) , SBA -15 (Xiao, Hong et al. 2013) , MCM -41 (Liu, Wan et al. 2012)  and zeolite 
(Zhang, Du et al. 2015) . Among the various supports, zeolites have been found to be promising 
for a photocatalyt ic system because of their special ion -exchange capability, large surface area, 
high adsorption ability, good thermal stability and environmentally friendly materials 
(Nezamzadeh -Ejhieh and Hushmandrad 2010 , Nezamzadeh -Ejhieh and Karimi -Shamsabadi 
2014) . Natural zeolites appear  more advantageous than synthetic zeolites, due to their 
abundance in nature, low cost and reduced chemical pollution during production  (Nezamzadeh -
Ejhieh and Karimi -Shamsabadi 2014) . Previous studies have reporte d that the high surface area 
and adsorption capability provided by the zeolite host can improve the photocatalytic efficiency 
of CuO or TiO 2-based catalysts (Corma and Garcia 2004, Nezamzadeh -Ejhieh and Karimi -
Shamsabadi 2014) . 
This work reports the results of doping LFO into acid -modified natural zeolite via a simple 
impregnation – calcination method and testing its photo -Fenton -like activity in decolorization 
of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light. The effects of varying operational parameters were 
studied to identify the highest decolorization efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, no such 
work has been previously published.   
7.2 Experimental  
7.2.1 Chemicals  
Natural zeolite (Escott zeolite) was obtained from Zeolite Australia Limited Company, 
Australia. Its chemical composition consists of SiO 2 (68.26%), TiO 2 (0.23%), Al 2O3 (12.99%),

 7.2.2 Zeolite modification   
The natural zeolite sample  was washed using deionized (DI) water for several times and then 
dried at 100 °C overnight, which was named as NZ. The H -forms of natural zeolite (HNZ) 
were prepared via direct acid modification of the base sample (Kurama et al., 2002) . Typically, 
23 g NZ was dispersed in 2 L of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 N  hydrochloric acid  (HCl) solution. The 
solution was magnetically stirred at 80 °C for 3 h. Afterward, the particles were filtered and 
rinsed with hot DI water for several times until the pH reached 7, then dried ov ernight. The 
resulting HNZ samples were designated 0.5HNZ, 1HNZ or 1.5HNZ, respectively. 1HNZ was 
also prepared by stirring at room temperature and the resulting sample was designated 1HNZ -
RT. 
7.2.3 Catalyst preparation  
LaFeO 3 (LFO) -doped 1HNZ  was prepared  by impregnation – calcination . A solution of 5 mL 
DI water and 10 mL alcohol was placed into a polypropylene bottle to which 2.165 g 
La(NO 3)3.6H 2O, 2.02 g Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O and 2.304 g citric acid was added. The resulting 
solution was continuously stirred for  3 h, followed by the addition of 2 g 1HNZ. The obtained 
suspension was left stirring at 70 °C and then dried at 100 °C overnight. The dried powders 
were calcined at 700 °C for 4 h (at the ramp rate of 2 oC min-1) and weighted. Assuming no 
zeolite particle s were lost during the synthesis, the resulting sample exhibited approximately 
30 wt% of LFO loading rate, thereby it was designated 1HNZ -30LFO. The same process was 
used to prepare 1HNZ -15LFO (consisting of ~15 wt% LFO) using a precursor solution of 1 .082 
g La(NO 3)3.6H 2O, 1.01 g Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O and 1.152 g citric acid. 1HNZ -60LFO (consisting of 
~60 wt% LFO) was prepared using a precursor solution of 4.33 g La(NO 3)3.6H 2O, 4.04 g 
Fe(NO 3)3.9H 2O and 4.608 g citric acid.    
A second set of samples was prepared fol lowing the same procedures and using the same 
composition of synthetic solution, but NZ was selected instead of 1HNZ as the support. The 
resulting samples were designated NZ -xLFO (x = 15, 30, 60), in which the symbol x represents 
the weight percentage of L FO in the resulting LFO -doped NZ sample, e.g. , 15%, 30% or 60%, 
if there assumed no loss of zeolite during the synthesis of catalysts. To further investigate the 
effect of NZ acid modification on catalytic performance, yHNZ -30LFO samples were 
synthesized using yHNZ as the support where y is the normality concentration of HCl (y = 0.5, Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 1 and 1.5). For comparison, a pure LFO catalyst withou t the addition of zeolite support was 
prepared under similar conditions.  
7.2.4 Material characterization  
The phase composition of sample was characterized using a GBC eMMA X -ray diffractometer 
(CuK α radiation; 28 mA; 35 kV; step size of 0.02°; step time of 1° min-1 and measurement 
range of 10° – 80°). The surface morphology of sample was observed by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM; Zeiss 1555; 5 kV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high -
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imag es were taken using TEM -TITAN  
(200 kV). Nitrogen adsorption -desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using SAPA2010 
(Micromeritics Inc, USA). Prior to analysis, the samples were degassed at 200 °C for 12 h 
under vacuum. The surface area was determined fr om the linear part of the BET plot (P/P 0 = 
0.05 ~ 0.20) and the pore size was calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm by 
using Barrett -Joyner -Hallenda (BJH). The total pore volume was evaluated from the adsorbed 
nitrogen amount at a relative pressure of 0.98.  
7.2.5 Decolorization of RhB  
RhB was used as a model organic in the decolorization test. The photodegradation experiment 
was conducted using a Xenon lamp (CEL -HX F300, Beijing, China) equipped with a 400 nm 
cut-off filter. Typically, the catalyst was added to 100 mL of RhB aqueous solution and the 
suspension was magnetically stirred in the dark for 60 min to reach the adsorption – desorption 
equilibrium of dye on the surface of the catalyst. Subsequently, a photo -Fenton reaction was 
initia ted by introduction of H 2O2 to the suspension and exposure to visible light. A small 
amount of sample was withdrawn at given periods of time and centrifuged for measurement. 
The concentration of RhB was estimated using Perkin Elmer Lambda 750 UV/Vis 
spectr ometer. The degradation efficiency of organic using the as -prepared sample was 
calculated as:  
𝐷𝑒𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  (%)=(1−𝐶𝑡
𝐶0)×100%                                                                              (7.1)                                                                       
where 𝐶0 is the concentration of RhB before the photo -Fenton reaction and 𝐶𝑡 is the 
concentration after time t in the photo -Fenton degradation.  Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
126 
 To understand the degradation kinetics of RhB as well as to quantitatively compare the catalytic 
performance among different samples, the pseudo -first-order model was used (Mahmoodi, 
Arami et al. 2006)   
−𝑙𝑛𝐶𝑡
𝐶0= 𝑘𝑡                                                                                                                          (7.2)                                                                                                                        
where  k is the pseudo -first-order rate constant, Ct is the concentration of RhB after time t in the 
photo -Fenton reaction. The rate constant ( k) was calculated  from the slope of plot of ln ( Ct /C0) 
versus  time.  
The total removal rate of RhB using each sample catalyst was calculated as:  
𝑅𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑙  𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒  (%)=(1−𝐶𝑖
𝐶)×100%                                                                             (7.3)                                                                              
where  C is the concentration of RhB in the fresh solution before starting adsorption and Ci is 
the concentration of RhB at a given period of time during the adsorption – degradati on process.  
To investigate the stability of the catalyst, repetitive photo -Fenton degradation test was 
conducted using 1HNZ -30LFO. After each experiment, the catalyst was separated from the 
suspension by centrifugation and calcined at 100 °C (denoted as 1 HNZ -30LFO -100) or 300 °C 
(denoted as 1HNZ -30LFO -300). The resulting powders were re -used to perform another 
degradation experiment.  
7.3 Results and discussion  
7.3.1 Synthesis of catalysts by doping LFO into zeolite and characterization  
7.3.1.1 Effect of LFO loading in NZ  
Different amounts of LFO were doped in the NZ support to produce the samples NZ -xLFO (x 
= 15, 30, 60).  Fig. 7.1a shows the XRD patterns of NZ -xLFO (x = 15, 30, 60), in comparison 
with that of NZ. As can be seen, the reflection peaks of N Z are in agreement with the literature 
(Saputra, Budihardjo et al. 2016) . The major characteristic peak of NZ at 26.6o was retained 
after LFO doping in NZ (NZ -15LFO, NZ -30LFO and NZ -60LFO) via the impregnation – 
calcination process. However, the intensity of this characteristic peak in the samples of NZ-
15LFO, NZ -30LFO and NZ -60LFO was significantly lower than that of NZ; which is likely to 
be due to the introduction of well crystalline LFO particles. In the XRD patterns of NZ -15LFO, 
NZ-30LFO and NZ -60LFO, some peaks appeared at 2 θ of 22.6, 32.2, 39.6,  46.3, 52.0, 57.4, 
67.4, 72.0 and 76.7o, which are identical to those in the XRD pattern of our synthesized LFO. Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan  
127 
 The crystals of LFO in the NZ supported samples were in orthorhombic structure 
(Thirumalairajan, Girija et al. 2014) . Moreover, higher density of LFO chara cteristic peaks was 
observed with the increase of LFO loading. These observations indicate that LFO crystals were 
successfully integrated into the NZ support in these samples.  
 
Fig. 7.1. XRD patterns (a) NZ, LFO and NZ -xLFO (x = 15, 30, 60); (b) SEM imag es of NZ 
and NZ -xLFO (x = 15, 30, 60).  
Fig. 7.1b shows the SEM images of NZ, and LFO -doped NZ samples. Agglomerated particles 
with layered -like structure and irregular shape were seen in NZ; whilst the SEM images of NZ -
xLFO (x = 15, 30, 60) present the sim ilar morphology. This implies that the doping with LFO 
in NZ did not affect the morphology of NZ support significantly.   
The textual properties, such as BET specific surface area, pore volume and pore size, of NZ 
and NZ -xLFO (x = 15, 30, 60) are listed in  Table 7.1. The BET specific surface area of NZ 
was 12.53 m2 g-1. As the amount of LFO incorporated into the NZ increased, there was a 
gradual loss of BET specific surface area. This might be ascribed to the impregnation and 
dispersion of LFO in the cavities and channels of agglomerated NZ particles.

The removal of RhB using NZ and NZ -xLFO (x = 15, 30, 60) via dark adsorption and visible 
light photo -Fenton -like degradation is illustrated in Fig. 7.2. Under visible light irradiation, the 
test using no catalyst showed minimal RhB decolorization of 0% without H 2O2 and 9.20% with 
H2O2. The NZ sample adsorbed 31.90%  of RhB in dark condition when reaching equilibrium 
due to its ion exchange capability (Farhade and Aziz, 2010; Wang and Zhu, 2006) . After 
exposure to visible light it slowly removed ~14% of RhB after 90 min. This was comparable 
to the amount of RhB which was degraded in the presence of light and H 2O2 without the use 
of catalyst. This implies that NZ is not an effective catalyst for photo -Fenton degradation of 
RhB.

Fig. 7.2. Effect of different catalysts on the removal rate of RhB (dosage = 1.0 g L-1; RhB = 10 
mg L-1; H 2O2 = 10 mM; initial pH = 6).  
The sample of LFO removed 1.70% and 85.13% of RhB via dark adsorption and photo -Fenton 
degradation, respectively. The doping of LFO in NZ decreased the adsorption capacity of the 
resulting material but drama tically improved its photo -Fenton catalytic performance. The RhB 
removal  via degradation using NZ -30LFO was the highest among the three samples of LFO -
doped NZ, being 74.37%. Its reaction rate constant k was 0.0169 min-1, which was greater than 
that of NZ -15LFO (0.0140 min-1) and NZ -60LFO (0.0121 min-1). In comparison with low 
removal rate (46.13%) for NZ, the RhB removal rates after 60 min dark adsorption and 90 min 
visible light exposure were 76.87%, 81.87%, and 72.95 %, respectively for NZ -15LFO, NZ -
30LF O and NZ -60LFO. Note that the total removal rate of RhB using LFO -doped NZ (72.95% 
- 81.87%) was lower than that using pure LFO (86.83%; Fig. 7.2), thus further improvement 
was needed.  
7.3.1.2 Effect of acid modification of NZ  
Acid treatment has been show n as a simple and economical method to improve adsorption 
ability and enlarge pore system of zeolites (Kurama, Zimmer et al. 2002, Wang, Ozdemir et al. 
2012) . Fig. 7.3a shows the XRD patterns of the zeolite supports 1HNZ and 1HNZ -RT, which 
were obtained after treating NZ with the use of 1 N HCl acid at 80 °C and room temperature, 
respectively. It was found that the modification of NZ by acid solution with and without h eating 
did not dramatically affect the crystal structure of NZ (Fig. 7.1a), but changed the intensity of 
some characteristic peaks. The BET surface area was 12.53 m2 g-1 for NZ, 36.78 m2 g-1 for 
Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 1HNZ -RT, and 142.05 m2 g-1 for 1HNZ, suggesting that the trea tment with acid significantly 
increased the surface area of the resulting zeolite support.  
 
Fig. 7.3. XRD patterns (a) and SEM images (b) of 1HNZ, 1HNZ -RT, 1HNZ -30LFO and 
1HNZ -RT-30LFO.  
The EDX results (Table 7.2) show that alkali and alkaline earth cations (Na, Ca and Mg) were 
partially removed during the acid treatment. In particular, a considerable amount of Al migrated 
into the solution when NZ was treated with 1 N HCl acid. The literature suggests the HCl ac id 
solution treatment leads to decationisation, dealumination and sometimes destruction of crystal 
lattice, as well as dissolution of some amorphous materials that may have been blocking the 
pores of NZ (Allen et al., 2009) . Acid treatment under higher tem perature might dissolve much 
more amorphous materials, resulting in the formation of support with larger surface area and 
pore volume.

 As compared with the XRD pattern of LFO (Fig. 7.1a), those of 1HNZ -30LFO and 1HNZ -RT-
30LFO show typical characteristic peaks arising from LFO. The BET surface area of 1HNZ -
30LFO and 1HNZ -RT-30LFO was 88.44 m2 g-1 and 15.53 m2 g-1, respectively, which was 
smaller than that of their respective parent supports, 1HNZ -RT (36.78 m2 g-1) and 1HNZ 
(142.05 m2 g-1). This can be attributed to the deposition of LFO particles on the NZ surface or 
their incorporation into the channels of agglomerated NZ. Fig. 7.3b shows the irregular 
morphology of acid -treated NZ (1HNZ -RT and 1HNZ) as well as the LFO -loaded acid -treated 
NZ (1HNZ -RT-30LFO and 1HNZ -30LFO), which is similar to that of NZ.  
 
Fig. 7.4. Effect of different catalysts (1HNZ -RT, 1HNZ, 1HNZ -RT-30LFO and 1HNZ -
30LFO) on the removal rate of RhB (dosage = 1.0 g L-1; RhB = 10 mg L-1; H 2O2 = 10 mM; 
initial pH = 6).  
Fig. 7.4 shows that, as expected, the acid modification significantly improved the  RhB 
adsorption capability of NZ from 31.90% to 40.80% for 1HNZ -RT and up to 56.10% for 
1HNZ; this dramatically decreased after the doping of LFO. 1HNZ -RT and 1HNZ exhibited a 
limited degradation rate of ~ 25%, which is slightly higher than that of untreat ed NZ (~14%). 
As discussed above, the acid treatment of NZ might remove some of materials in channels and 
in turn increase surface area; thus enhancing exposure of active sites, superficial ions, in the 
photo -Fenton to produce free radicals (Khataee, Rad et al. 2016) . After dark adsorption 
followed by light irradiat ion, the total RhB removal % of 1HNZ -RT and 1HNZ was 70.52% 
and 79.06%, respectively.  
Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 The samples of 1HNZ -RT-30LFO and 1HNZ -30LFO exhibited higher removal rates (97.60% 
and 79.75%) than those of 1HNZ -RT and 1HNZ. 83.11% of RhB was removed during photo -
Fenton degradation when using 1HNZ -30LFO; whereas that dropped to 66.65% when using 
1HNZ -RT-30LFO. The observed reaction rate constant k was the highest (0.0456 min-1) for 
1HNZ -30LFO as compared to 0.0079 min-1, 0.0091 min-1, 0.0146 min-1 for 1HNZ -RT, 1HNZ, 
and 1HNZ -RT-30LFO, respectively. The large surface area of 1HNZ could offer more space 
for LFO to deposit and form active sites; and its high pore volume may provide more channels 
for RhB to access the active sites. As a result, the deg radation and removal were enhanced.  
7.3.1.3 Effect of acid concentration in NZ modification  
To investigate the effect of HCl concentration during acid modification of NZ on the RhB 
removal of LFO -doped modified zeolite samples, the HCl concentration of 0. 5 N, 1.0 N to 1.5 
N was selected. No significant change was seen from the XRD patterns of 0.5HNZ -30LFO, 
1HNZ -30LFO and 1.5HNZ -30LFO (Fig. 7.5a). The SEM images showed that all samples had 
a similar morphology.  
 
Fig. 7.5. XRD patterns (a) and SEM images (b) of yHNZ -30LFO (y = 0.5, 1, 1.5).  
In Fig. 7.6, the RhB adsorption and degradation using 0.5HNZ -30LFO and 1HNZ -30LFO 
differed slightly. However, as the HCl concentration was raised up to 1.5 N during the 
modification of NZ, there was a considerable decrease in the RhB removal observed for 
1.5HNZ -30 L FO, especially degradation %. The reduced BET specific surface area and pore

133 
 volume of 1.5HNZ -30LFO was seen in Table 7.1, in relative to 0.5HNZ -30LFO and 1HNZ -
30LFO. This could possibly be explained by the structure interruption during the high -
concentrat ion acid modification of NZ, which reduced the number and access of active sites 
for adsorption and degradation (Allen et al., 2009) . The samples of 1.5HNZ -30LFO and 
0.5HNZ -30LFO had reaction rate constant k of 0.0181 min-1 and 0.0374 min-1, as compared 
with the highest performance of 1HNZ -30LFO ( k = 0.0456 min-1).

RhB for yHNZ -30LFO (y = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) (dosage = 1.0 g L-1; RhB = 10 mg L-1; H 2O2 = 10 
mM; initial pH = 6).  
7.3.1.4 Effect of LFO loading in HNZ  
As seen from the above results, 1 N HCl solution and moderate heating was suggested for use 
to modify NZ; the resulting modified NZ could be utilized to assist the synthesis of catalyst 
with enhanced performance. On the other side, the variation of LFO loading into acid -modified 
NZ could largely tailor the performance of resulting catalyst. The phase composition and 
crystal structure of 1HNZ -xLFO samples (x = 15, 30, 60) were examined (see Fig . 7.7a), as 
compared with those of 1HNZ and LFO.

with the support 1HNZ and LFO.  
The major characteristic peak of 26.6° in 1HNZ was still found in all of the LFO -doped samples 
1HNZ -xLFO (x = 15, 30, 60). The XRD patterns of 1HNZ -xLFO (x = 15, 30, 60) also had 
peaks which were identical to those of LFO. The SEM images showed that all samples had 
similar morphology, consisting of agglomerated irregular particles (Fig. 7.7b).

Fig. 7.8a presents the TEM image of 1HNZ -30LFO, showing the dark spots (highlighted in 
red), which were LFO nanoparticles with a diameter in the range of 20 nm – 30 nm distributed 
in the 1HNZ support. The LFO nanoparticles exhibited clear lattice fringes with an interplanar 
distance of 0.28 nm, which corresponds to the (121) crystal plane of LFO (Wang et al., 2006) , 
as shown in Fig. 7.8b. The LFO distribution in 1HNZ is also indicated by the La mapping 
image of 1HNZ -30LFO shown in Fig. 7.8d, which confirms that th e LFO nanoparticles were 
well dispersed across the sample of 1HNZ -30LFO. Moreover, the decrease of BET specific

 surface area and total pore volume with increasing LFO doping (Table 7.1) further suggest the 
successful depositing of LFO into the channels of 1HNZ -xLFO, which are the active sites for 
RhB degradation.  
As seen above in Fig. 7.4, 1HNZ adsorbed 56.10% of RhB in dark followed by 22.96% 
degraded after 90 min visible light irradiation. The adsorptive removal of RhB in dark reduced 
gradually by increas ing doping of LFO in 1HNZ, as shown in Fig. 7.9.

(dosage = 1.0 g L-1; RhB =10 mg L-1; H 2O2 = 10 mM; initial pH = 6).  
On the other side, the doping with LFO significantly improved the degradation removal of RhB 
under visible light irradiation. In comparison with low degradation of 1HNZ (22.96%; k = 
0.0091 min-1), the degradation of RhB using 1HNZ -15LFO ( k = 0.0286 min-1) and 1HNZ -
30LFO ( k = 0.0456 min-1) reached 65.89% and 83.11%, respectively. The further increasing 
doping resulted in a decrease of degradation % and k. The removal for 1HNZ -60LFO was only 
72.85% with k = 0.0181 min-1. The lower activity of 1HNZ -60LFO may b e attributed to the 
increasing dosage of LFO blocking the channels of agglomerated zeolite, reducing the surface 
area of catalyst, hindering the transport of organic and deteriorating the degradation. The low 
adsorption capability of 1HNZ -60LFO could also more or less affect the subsequent photo -
Fenton degradation (Dong et al., 2010; Li and Ye, 2007; Zhao et al., 1998) .   
The highest removal rate of RhB was obtained with 1HNZ -30LFO (as 97.61%), which was 
significantly greater than that using the pure LFO crystals (86.83%). This might be due to the 
enhancement of dark adsorption using 1HNZ -30LFO (~14.5%) as compared with LFO  
Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 (~1.7%), which could largely facilitate the subsequent photo -Fenton degradation under visible 
light (Dong et al., 2010; Li and Ye, 2007; Zhao et al., 1998) . Most importantly, the use of 
1HNZ as the support in the fabrication of LFO -based catalyst resulted  in an increase of surface 
area and in turn active sites which are accessible to organic for degradation. It should be noted 
that the actual amount of LFO participating the photo -Fenton reaction when using 1HNZ -
30LFO (approximately 0.3 g L-1 LFO at the dos age of 1.0 g L-1 1HNZ -30LFO) was much lower 
than the use of pure LFO (at the dosage of 1.0 g L-1 LFO), suggesting the LFO active sites in 
the LFO -doped zeolites were more efficient. Therefore, 1HNZ -30LFO was suggested for use 
in the following optimization of degradation conditions.  
7.3.2 Photo -Fenton Catalytic Degradation of RhB  
7.3.2.1 Effect of catalyst dosage  
The effect of 1HNZ -30LFO concentration on degradation efficiency was investigated by 
varying dosage from 0.5 g L-1 to 1.2 g L-1. Fig. 7.10 shows the decolorization of RhB solution 
increased considerably from 84.9% to 98.3% when the catalyst dosage was changed from 0.5 
g L-1 to 0.8 g L-1; but then decreased when the amount of catalyst in solution was increased 
from 0.8 g L-1 to 1.2 g L-1. The pseudo -first-order reaction rate constant k was the highest 
(0.0548 min-1) when using the catalyst dosage of 0.8 g L-1; as compared with 0.0268 min-1, 
0.0456 min-1, and 0.0203 min-1 when the catalyst dosage was 0.5 g L-1, 1.0 g L-1 and 1.2 g L-1, 
respectively. T he increase of catalyst concentration, e.g. , from 0.5 g L-1 to 0.8 g L-1, 
undoubtedly provided more active sites and thereby contributed to the higher degradation 
efficiency of RhB. When the dosage was further raised from 0.8 g L-1 up to 1.2 g L-1, an incr ease 
in solution turbidity might have reduced light penetration and therefore led to lower 
degradation efficiency.    Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

pseudo -first-order rate constants.  
7.3.2.2 Effect H 2O2 concentration  
The effect of H 2O2 concentration on the removal of RhB was studied in the range of 5 mM – 
20 mM H 2O2 solution, as shown in Fig. 7.11a. The highest degradation efficiency (98.3%) with 
a rate constant k of 0.0548 min-1 was found when adopting 10 mM H 2O2 (Fig. 7.11b).

corresponding pseudo -first-order rate constants.  
It is speculated that the photo -Fenton catalytic degradation of RhB was ascribed to the 
combined effects of conduction electron scavenging (Eq s. (7.7) and  (7.8)) and the Fenton 
Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 reaction by iron species (Eq s. (7.4) – (7.6)). The generated hydroxyl radicals •OH are active 
species that oxidize many organics (Eq. (7.11)) (Ju, Chen et al. 2011) . 
≡FeIII + H 2O2 → ≡FeIIIH2O2 → ≡FeII + HO 2• + H+ (7.4) 
≡FeIII + HO 2•+ H+ → ≡FeII + O 2 + 2H+ (7.5)

dye + hυ → dye* (7.9) 
dye + ℎ𝑣𝑏+ → dye+ (7.10) 
•OH + dye (or dye+) → Degradation products  (7.11) 
The increase in H 2O2 concentration from 5 mM to 10 mM  achieved higher removal efficiency 
due to enhanced generation of hydroxyl radicals •OH. However, higher H 2O2 concentration 
(e.g., 15 mM – 20 mM) resulted in lower RhB degradation rates. This is possibly due to excess 
H2O2 reacting with •OH to produce hydroperoxyl radicals HO 2•, which is less reactive (Neamtu, 
Yediler et al. 2003) . 
7.3.2.3 Effect of initial pH  
Dye-containing wastewater is discharged from various industrial activities and thus can have a 
range of pH values. The effect of pH on the degradation of RhB using 1HNZ -30LFO was 
investigated for pH values ranging from 3 to 10. It can be seen in Fig. 7.12 that the degradation 
efficiency was improved from pH 3 to pH 4 with k increasing from 0.0421 min-1 to 0.0571 min-
1. The maximum RhB degradation was reached at pH 4 (99.0%) and then it gradually decreased. 
In our system, the efficiency of RhB degradation be yond pH 6 was remarkably decreased, 
which was 86.7% ( k = 0.0224 min-1) at pH 8 and 62.9% ( k = 0.0127 min-1) at pH 10, 
respectively. A similar trend has been reported in the previous study (Ai, Zhang et al. 2014) . Chapter 7                                                                                     PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

Fig. 7.12. (a) Effect of initial solution pH on the degradation efficiency of RhB under visible 
light irradiation by using 1HNZ -30LFO (dosage = 0.8 g L-1; RhB = 10 mg L-1; H2O2 = 10 mM); 
(b) corresponding pseudo -first-order rate constants.  
Obviously, higher degrada tion efficiency of RhB was seen in acidic solution than alkaline. A 
possible reason is that in acidic medium, the formation of hydroxyl radicals •OH was found to 
be easier than in neutral or alkaline condition (Elmorsi, Riya d et al. 2010, Cao, Xu et al. 2012) , 
resulting in the enhanced degradation efficiency. Furthermore, when the pH of solution is 
higher than 4, the deprotonation of the carboxyl groups in RhB could occur easily and 
transform into its zwitterionic form, wh ich might increase aggregation of RhB into bigger 
molecular species (Guo, Zhao et al. 2005)  and hinder its transport to the active sites of 1 HNZ -
30LFO. This would lead to deterioration in degradation performance. From a practical 
application point of view, especially considering neutral pH was normally found in textile 
industrial wastewater, RhB removal at a pH of 6 would minimize the cost in pH adjustment 
and give considerably high degradation efficiency of RhB (98.3% , k = 0.0549 min-1).  
7.3.2.4 Effect of dye concentration  
Fig. 7.13 shows the degradation efficiency strongly depended on the initial dye concentration 
varying from 10 mg L-1 to 40 mg L-1. The efficiency of RhB degradation was observed to 
decrease as the RhB concentration increased up to 40 mg L-1 (68.6%; k = 0.0124 min-1). As 
incre asing the initial concentration of RhB, the number of organic molecules in water increased 
but not the hydroxyl radical concentration. In addition, the light transmittance of reaction 
solution was lowered at higher RhB concentration, thus reducing the amou nt of visible light 
reaching the surface of 1HNZ -30LFO, its absorption and eventually the generation of hydroxyl 
radicals •OH.

6). (b) corresponding pseudo -first-order rate constants.  
7.3.2.5 Reusability in d egradation  
In order to investigate the feasibility reusing 1HNZ -30LFO, four consecutive degradation tests 
were performed under the conditions as optimized above: 10 mg L-1 RhB, 0.8 g L-1 1HNZ -
30LFO, pH = 6, 10 mM H 2O2 and irradiation time of 90 min. After each experiment, the 
suspension was centrifuged to separate the catalyst (1HNZ -30LFO -100 or 1HNZ -30LFO -300), 
which was then washed with DI water several times and calcined at 100 °C or 300 °C for future 
use.  
Fig. 7.14a shows that there was a gradual decre ase in the RhB degradation in successive tests, 
from 95.7% (1st cycle) to 76.3% (4th cycle) for 1HNZ -30LFO -100. For comparison, the RhB 
degradation was 98.3% for fresh 1HNZ -30LFO (red line shown in Fig. 7.14a). This might be 
attributed to the accumulation of intermediates on the surface of the catalyst as well as in the 
cavities of zeolite support, which reduced the amount of organic that could be degraded from 
the fresh solution. It is possible that the posttreatment temperature of 300 °C decomposed these 
intermediates. As a result, the degradation rate of RhB using 1HNZ -30LFO -300 was higher 
(97.4% in 1st cycle - 82.9% in 4th cycle) than that of 1HNZ -30LFO -100. The results show that 
1HNZ -30LFO could still retain high activity after simple calcination treatm ent for four cycles 
of reuse; a higher calcination temperature favoured greater RhB removal. The XRD patterns of 
spent 1HNZ -30LFO -100 and 1HNZ -30LFO -300 after four cycles of RhB degradation were 
similar to that of fresh 1HNZ -30LFO (Fig. 7.14b), implying it s good stability in the recycling

removal.

XRD patterns of fresh 1HNZ -30LFO before use and spent 1HNZ -30LFO -100 and 1HNZ -

In the literature, there have been some attempts loading LFO into different types of supports 
for use as heterogeneous photo -Fenton -like catalysts to degrade organics or dyes (Vaiano, 
Isupova et al. 2014, Vaiano, Iervolino et al. 2015, Peng, Fu et al. 2016, Orak, Atalay et al. 2017, 
Wang, Niu et al. 2017) . In particular, the works published by Niu ’s group and Yang’s group 
showed the photo -Fenton performance of LFO -doped montmorillonite and carbon spheres in 
terms of RhB removal (Peng, Fu et al. 2016, Wang, Niu et al. 2017) . Although the reaction 
conditions and light source vary, the performance of our as -prepared 1HNZ -30LFO is 
promising as compared with their works. For example, the use of 1HNZ -30LFO removed over 
98% RhB after 90 min visible light illumination under the optimal conditions  (initial dye 
concentration = 10 mg L-1; catalyst dosage = 0.8 g L-1; initial H 2O2 concentration = 10 mM; 
initial pH = 6). Under the similar conditions (initial dye concentration = 0.02 mmol L-1; catalyst 
dosage  = 1 g L-1; initial H 2O2 concentration =  10 mM), the LFO -loaded montmorillonite 
degraded approximately 99% RhB after 90 min light irradiation ( Peng et al., 2016). Similar 
performance between 1HNZ -30LFO and LFO-montmorillonite was seen; however, the catalyst 
dosage of 1HNZ -30LFO was lower in our case (0.8 g L-1) as compared to LFO -montmorillonite 
(1 g L-1), suggesting good degradation efficiency using our catalyst.

 7.4 Conclusions  
In this work, LaFeO 3 (LFO) -doped acid -modified natural zeolite (HNZ) was synthesized and 
its utilization as a photo -Fenton -like catalyst for RhB removal under visible light irradiation 
was studied. Different preparation conditions, including LFO loading and acid treatment of 
NZ, were investigated for their effect on RhB removal. The sample of 1HNZ -30LFO, which 
was synthesized by using the support which was obtained after heated acid treatment of NZ 
and doping of ~30 wt% LFO, demonstrated the best catalytic performance and highest RhB 
removal. The degradation efficiency of RhB was increased by incre asing loading of 1HNZ -
30LFO from 0.5 g L-1 to 0.8 g L-1, but a further increase in catalyst dosage reduced RhB 
removal. A slightly acidic solution resulted in the highest degradation efficiency of RhB and 
the optimal pH when using 1HNZ -30LFO was suggested as 6. The change of H 2O2 
concentration from 5 mM to 10 mM enhanced the photo -Fenton reaction in the presence of 
1HNZ -30LFO; whereas the increase of RhB concentration suppressed the degradation. The 
sample of 1HNZ -30LFO had relatively good stability in term s of its catalytic activity for photo -
Fenton degradation of RhB, which was largely retained over 4 cycles. The results suggest that 
1HNZ -30LFO could be an effective visible -light-driven Fenton -like catalyst for use in 
wastewater treatment.

 Chapter 8. Techno -economic analysis of photo -Fenton process in a 
wastewater treatment plant  
8.1 Experimental setup for photo -Fenton treatment under artificial visible 
light irradiation  
In a pilot plant, the photo -Fenton -degradation experiments (Fig. 8.1) were performed under 
sunlight using compound parabolic collectors (CPC), one reservoir tank (250 L) and one 
recirculatio n pump (0.55 kW), and operated in batch mode (García -Montaño, Pérez -Estrada et 
al. 2008, Navarro, Fenoll et al. 2011) . The CPC consists of eight borosilicate glass tubes (200 
cm length × 4 cm I.D), which were placed on a 37o-tilted fixed platform. There were two 
parabolic aluminium mirrors with ref lective surface around each reactor tube. Total illuminated 
area and volume were 8.24 m2 and 22 L, respectively. Prior to the photo -Fenton reaction, the 
collectors were covered and the certain amount of catalyst was added to the tank. Water was 
re-circulat ed at a flow of 20 L min-1 from the tank to CPC and back to the tank in a closed 
circuit. After 30 min, the cover was removed and the necessary amount of hydrogen peroxide 
was added. At regular time intervals, the samples were collected for spectrophotomet ric 
analysis.

 scale -up laboratory -scale experiments, similar photo -Fenton conditions were applied in the 
pilot plant. Noting that, the intensity of light source is one of the important factors affecting the 
photodegradation efficiencies; therefore, in ord er to obtain a similar photodegradation rate as 
in the bench -scale experiments, it was assumed that the pilot -scale experiments were performed 
under artificial radiation of Xe lamps with the light intensity of 1700 W/m2. With the total 
illuminated area of 8.24 m2 as discussed above, the system requires 28 Xenon lamps of 500W 
mounting with a UV -vis filter.

8.2 Techno -Economic evaluation of photo -Fenton process at pilot scale  
The total cost of the wastewater treatment via photo -Fenton process is determined by the sum 
of the operating, capital and maintenance costs. For a real industrial scale system, these costs 
significantly depend on several factors such as the na ture of organic pollutants existing in 
wastewater, the flow rate of the effluent, the nature of reagents, and the configuration of 
reactors. For a wastewater treatment plant, the operating costs (covering the operational and 
monitoring costs) can account f or up to 50% of the total cost. Therefore, the consideration of 
operating costs is crucial before changing or implementing a new process. This research only 
considers the operating cost, which is expressed by the following equation:  
 𝑂𝐶=𝐶𝐸+ 𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐 𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠                                                                                                         (8.1) 
where OC is the total operating cost (AUD/m3); 𝐶𝐸 is the energy cost (AUD/m3)  and  𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠  
is the reactants cost (AUD/m3). The terms in equation (8.1) are calculated according to 
equations ( 8.2) and ( 8.3). 
The energy demand is one of the important factors that must be taken into account.  The energy 
cost is calculated based on the power needed to pump water through the CPCs  and the power 
of Xe lamps, as in the following equation:  Chapter 8                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

𝑉                                                                                                                 (8.2)  
where 𝑃𝐸 is the cost of power, 0.1 ¢/kWh; W P and W L are the power required to pump water 
and the power of Xe lamps; t is the number of working hours a day, which is assumed of 12 
hours; V is the capacity of the plant in m3/day, which is 14.4 m3/day.  
In the experiments performed, the photo -Fenton process w as carried out under natural pH 
solution, which did not require any further chemicals for adjustment of solution pH. Therefore, 
the cost of reactants is estimated by calculating the amount of hydrogen peroxide required for 
the photo -Fenton process and the amount of lanthanum ferrite catalyst, as given in equation 
(3). 
𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠 =𝐶𝐻2𝑂2+𝐶𝐿𝑎𝐹𝑒𝑂 3                                                                                               (8.3) 
Lanthanum ferrite catalyst was produced from the  mixture of nitrate salts and citric acid 
followed by addition of ammonia solution. The price of ammonia solution is not considered as 
the amount consumed was insignificant. Therefore, the cost of lanthanum ferrite catalyst could 
be estimated from the cost  of the precursors . During the LaFeO 3 (LFO) synthesis process, the 
real amounts of precursors used to synthesise LFO catalyst  are as follows:  2.085 g LFO catalyst 
was produced from 2.165 g La(NO 3)3 mixing with 2.02 g Fe(NO 3)3, followed by adding 1.92 g 
C6O7H8.  
            We assumed that the cost of the catalyst was the sum of costs of the precursor costs. The current 
prices of these precursors are obtained from New Alliance Dye Chem Private Limited, India 
and Xinyi Yimao Advanced materials Co., Ltd, China as fo llows: 1.32 AUD/kg La(NO 3)3 (99% 
of purity),  1.2 AUD/kg Fe(NO 3)3 (99% of purity), 3.3 AUD  kg-1 Cu(NO 3)2 (98% of purity), 
1.306 AUD kg-1 SiO 2 (99% of purity), 0.198 AUD kg-1 natural zeolite, 0.024 AUD kg-1 H2O2 
(50% w/ v, density (ρ) at 25 °C = 1.2 g cm-3)  and 0.86 AUD kg-1 C6O7H8 (99% of purity).  
             The cost of H 2O2 could be calculated according to following equation:

            The operating cost of a photo -Fenton pilot plant is calculated for each catalyst system, as shown 
in Table 8.2. Obviously, the costs for energy and staff are the same for different catalyst 
systems, and it is assumed that the operating cost is significantly affected by the costs of 
reactants, which are dependent on the reaction conditions. As expected, the costs increase with 
the increasing amount of reactants in most cases.  Therefore, to calculate the effectiveness of 
catalyst system to photo -Fenton process, a cost/efficiency ratio (lower is better) is considered.  
The values in Table 8.2 show that the best cata lyst system for the photo -Fenton pilot plant is 
LFO-doped zeolite, with the lowest cost/efficiency ratio of 0.132.  However, the manufacturing 
of this catalyst system is more complicated than other catalysts, which can limit its application 
at industrial sc ale. Thus, with the purpose of minimizing the cost and reaching the highest 
removal rate of organic dyes, the LFO catalyst should be highlighted as the most effective 
catalyst for the photo -Fenton treatment, with the second best cost/efficiency ratio (0.13 4) and 
the best photocatalytic performance (99.5% of RhB removal).  
Another relevant factor to be considered is that the cost for energy is much higher than reagents 
costs, which accounts for over 87% of the total operating cost. This is attributed to the u se of 
artificial radiation of Xe non lamps as a visible light source for photo -Fenton reaction. A 
reduction of light collector surface area can lead to the decrease in the power supply for photo -
Fenton process. This is because: (i) the lower the collector s urface area, the less Xe non lamps 
are required and (ii) the smaller the surface, the shorter the photoreactor tube is; therefore the 
power demand for water pumping through the CPC decreases. However, it must be noted that 
decreasing the CPC size might resu lt in the decreasing the plant capacity. In summary, the 
operating costs for photo -Fenton pilot plant are deemed to be significantly affected by 
parameters such as reactants, CPC size and energy supply, which should be carefully evaluated 
for each case.  Chapter 9                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 Chapter 9. Conclusions and recommendations for future research  
9.1 Conclusions  
            This research study developed the LFO -based photocatalysts with high photo -Fenton 
efficiency toward organic dyes degradation under visible light. The performances of 
heterogeneous photo -Fenton catalysts were improved by optimization of hydrothe rmal 
synthesis of LOF, partial substitution of foreign element into Fe -site of LFO or immobilization 
of LFO particles onto porous materials  (e.g. silica and zeolite) . The study also optimized  the 
photo -Fenton degradation process of organic dyes  and carried  out the assessment of techno -
economic aspect for a wastewater treatment plant using the LFO -based catalysts developed in 
this research as well as visible light . The outcomes of this research contributed valuable and 
novel information to scholarly knowledg e, especially in the field of visible -light-initiated 
Fenton degradation of organic dyes. The major achievements are as follows.  
1. The photo -Fenton -like catalytic activity of ReFeO 3 (Re = Pr, Gd, and La) was evaluated 
based on the removal of RhB  dye under visible light irradiation. Our results revealed that the 
variation of Re -site atom in the rare earth orthoferrite greatly affected its physicochemical and 
photocatalytic properties. In comparison with PrFeO 3 and GdFeO 3, LaFeO 3 (LFO) exhibited 
larger struc tural distortion, narrower band gap and larger specific surface area, and in turn 
higher photocatalytic activity. 98.2% of RhB removal was achieved after 90 min exposure to 
visible light in the presence of 1 g L-1 catalyst and 10 mM H 2O2 at an ini tial solution pH = 5.  
2. LFO catalysts were synthesized via the hydrothermal method , in which the iron precursors , 
synthetic solution pH and calcination temperatures  were varied . The LFO catalyst, which was 
prepared with the use of ferric nitrate, pH of synthetic solution = 9, and calcination at 800 °C,  
exhibited favourable material characteristics and in turn good photocatalytic activity  for the 
removal of RhB . Almost 100% of degradation rate was achieved after 90 min visible light 
illumination under the  initial conditions of pH = 5, 10 mg L-1 RhB, 0.2 g L-1 H2O2, and 0.5 g 
L-1 catalyst loading.  
3. The partial substitution of Cu into Fe site of LFO has proven to narrow band gap energy of 
Cu-doped LFO and enhance its catalytic activity. During the photocata lytic activity tests, it was 
found that LFO -15Cu with a theoretical 15 mol% Cu doping was more effective than the pure 
LFO, which improved MO degradation rate by approximately 60%. The enhanced photo -
Fenton degradation efficiency could be attributed to the  formation of more hydroxyl radicals Chapter 9                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 during the decolorization of MO. The encouraging data also indicated the high stability and 
reusability of LFO -15Cu, showing a great potential as a promising catalyst for organic pollutant 
removal in the field of wastew ater treatment.  
4. An impregnation -calcination method was reported to immobilise LFO onto the mesoporous 
silica s which having  a unique fine pore system, narrow inner channels and wide outer pore 
opening . The effect of operational parameters , such as catalyst dosage, H 2O2 concentration, 
initial solution pH, and co -existing anions , on the photo -Fenton degradation of RhB under 
visible light was systematically studied . Experimental results showed that the catalyst , the 
LFO-loaded mesoporous silic a (with theoretical LFO/silica molar ratio of 0.15 ; denoted as 
HPS-0.15LFO) exhibited great surface area and a narrow bandgap; it, thus, exhibited higher 
total removal rate of RhB (98.9%) as compared to others with different loadings of LFO.  The 
degradati on efficiency of RhB was increased by increasing the loading of catalyst from 0.5 g 
L-1 to 1 g L-1; but a further increase in catalyst dosage reduced RhB removal. An alkaline 
solution resulted in the low degradation efficiency of RhB and the optimal pH whe n using 
HPS-0.15LFO was suggested as 6. The change of H 2O2 concentration from 10 mM to 15 mM 
enhanced the photo -Fenton reaction in the presence of HPS -0.15LFO; whereas the presence of 
Cl- and SO 42- showed an inhibitory effect on the photo -Fenton catalytic degradation  of RhB . 
5. LFO-doped acid -modified natural zeolites were successfully prepared by an impregnation -
calcination method for the first time. The NZ sample was pre -treated by an acid treatment to 
improve adsorption ability and enlarge pore system of  zeolite.  Results showed that the sample 
consist ing of approximately 30 wt% LFO into 1  N HCl-modified natural zeolite (1HNZ -
30LFO) presented a greater removal  of RhB than the pure LFO and parent acid modified -
natural zeolite. The use of 1HNZ -30LFO removed  over 98% RhB after 90 min visible light 
irradiation under the optimal conditions: initial dyes concentration = 10 mg L-1; catalyst dosage 
= 0.8 g L-1; initial H 2O2 concentration = 10 mM; initial pH = 6. This was ascribed to the 
synergistic effect of good adsorption ability of modified zeolite host and a large number of 
active sites provided by LFO guest for  the photo -Fenton reaction.  
6. A photo -Fenton -like photocatalytic degradation mechanism over LFO -based photocatalysts 
was proposed. As well known, the iron-based catalysts can activate H 2O2 to produce •OH 
radicals through the photo -Fenton -like reaction and enhance decomposition of organic 
pollutants. Therefore, the use of LFO -based photocatalysts might initiate the activation of H 2O2 
in the photo -Fenton reaction via two pathways: (i) heterogeneous Fenton -like catalytic Chapter 9                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 mechanism and (ii) photolysis mechanism. The electron spin resonance (ESR) technique or 
scavenger experiments both confirmed the important role of hydroxyl radicals in t he photo -
Fenton -like catalytic degradation of RhB.  
7. In this study, all  of the developed  LFO-based catalysts showed relatively high degradation 
efficiency, good reusability and chemical stability, which may enable their promising industrial 
application as  the visible -light-driven photo -Fenton -like photocatalysts for  the removal of 
organic s, especially dyes,  from wastewater.  
8. The preliminary techno -economic analysis suggested that by balancing cost/efficiency ratio 
and photocatalytic performance, LFO shou ld be highlighted as the effective photo -Fenton 
catalyst among all LFO -based materials  which were developed in this research . It showed  the 
second best cost/efficiency ratio (0.134) and the best photocatalytic performance (99.5% of 
RhB removal).     
9. The future practical application of heterogeneous photo -Fenton catalyst needs optimization. 
For example, when the solution pH was increased above 5, a dramatic reduction of degradation 
rate using the all our LFO-based catalysts was observed . This suggest s the adequate adjustment 
of solution pH be necessary, which might increase cost in wastewater pre -treatment or/and 
post-treatment. Moreover, the adoption of photo -Fenton process in treating highly polluted 
wastewater using visible light would require sola r reaction with large surface area, which 
constitutes a major obstacle for industrial use. During the study, we also found that the selection 
of suitable light source was of vital meaning, significantly affecting degradation performance. 
Other issues shoul d not be neglected when scaling up the application of our catalyst in industry, 
such as the efficient recovery of slurry after the photo -Fenton reaction and its reuse . 
9.2 Recommendations for future research  
In order to promote the wide application of the photo -Fenton process for wastewater treatment 
in the future, several recommendations relating to the heterogeneous photo -Fenton catalysts 
need to be taken into account.  
1. The photo -Fenton efficiency of LFO -based catalysts for the removal organics may be further 
improved by co -doping other elements at Fe-site of LFO . The co -doped samples are expected 
to have smaller bandgap energ ies, which would allow the photocatalysts absorb larger fraction 
of energy  coming from the solar spectrum.   Chapter 9                                                                                    PhD Thesis: Thi To Nga Phan

 2. Synergistic effect of adsorption and photo -Fenton catalytic activity of the supported LFO  
catalysts could be largely enhanced by tailoring the porous structure of support s. Hierarchically 
structured porous materials wit h multimodal size distributions, such as micro -meso, micro -
macro, meso -macro, micro -meso -macro or meso -meso -macro might be considered as potential 
support s. 
3. The stability of LFO -based catalysts need s to be examined for extended runs of recycle and 
reuse.  An ideal candidate of photo -Fenton catalyst should possess not only high photocatalytic 
activity, but also long lifetime. Other issues should not be neglected , including ease and cost 
of large -scale catalyst fabrication .  
4. From the practical view of application , it should also be noted that a stable photocatalytic 
system with high efficiency and low -cost need be developed to make photo -Fenton process 
viable for  real industrial wastewater treatment. Coupling the photo -Fenton process with other 
physical or chemical treatment may be  considered in the quest of finding a promising 
application of wastewater treatment. For example, photo -Fenton process owned the non -
selective reactivity on the non -biodegrad able and soluble pollutant s, which could be effectively 
used as pre -treatment step to enhance the biodegradation ability of the recalcitrant organic 
pollutants before entering the biological treatment. In this way, the residence time and reaction 
volume fo r the biological treatment could be significantly reduced.
