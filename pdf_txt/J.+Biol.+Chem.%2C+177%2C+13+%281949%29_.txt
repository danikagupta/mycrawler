Abstract 13 
Protein quantification is an important tool for a wide range of biological applications. The most 14 
common broadscale methods include the Lowry, bicinchoninic acid (BCA), and Coomassie Bradford 15 
assays . Despite their wide applicability , the mechanisms of action imply that these methods may not 16 
be ideal for  large transmembrane proteins  due to the proteins ’ integration in the plasma membrane.  17 
Here, we investigate  this problem by assess ing the efficacy  and applicability of these  three common 18 
protein quantification methods on a candidate transmembrane protein  – the Na,K -ATPase (NKA). We 19 
compared these methods  to an ELISA , which we newly developed and describe here for the 20 
quantification of NKA . The use of a relative standard curve allows this ELISA to be easily adapted to 21 
other proteins  and across the animal kingdom . Our results revealed that the three conventional 22 
methods significantly underestimate the concentration of NKA  compared to the ELISA . Further, by 23 
applying the protein concentrations determined by the different m ethods to i n vitro assays , we found 24 
that variation in the resulting data was consistently low when the assay reactions were prepared  based 25 
on concentrations determined from the ELISA. Thus, when target protein concentrations vary across 26 
samples, the conventional quantification methods cannot produce reliable results in downstream 27 
applications. In contrast, the ELISA we describe here consistently provides robust results.  28

1. Introduction  30 
 31 
Many  biological applications  rely on protein quantification . These include biochemical assays that 32 
assess the function of proteins [1,2] , the assessment of protein abundance s between tissues and 33 
species [3], and the assessment of knockdown experiments [4]. The most common all-encompassing 34 
methods of protein quantification include the Lowry, bicinchoninic acid  (BCA), and Coomassie Bradford 35 
assays [5–7]. In general, these methods are sensitive, simple, inexpensive, and easily re producible [8]. 36 
Moreover, they are available as standardized commercial kits. In all three methods, total protein 37 
concentration is detected by a color signal whose intensity correlates with the quantity of total protein 38 
present in the sample a nd which can be measured spectrophotometrically .  39

Both the Lowry and BCA assays are copper -based quantification methods. They rely on the reduction 41 
of cupric ions (Cu2+) to cuprous ions (Cu+) – a process known as the biuret reaction. This reaction is 42 
facilitated by the peptide bonds of proteins  and the subsequent b iuret signal formed intensifies in 43 
proportion to the amount of Cu+ in the sample  [5,6,9] . Therefore, the more peptide bonds are 44 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 2 accessible to Cu2+ in the re action, the stronger the biuret signal, and thus the higher the determined 45 
protein concentration will be.  46 
 47 
In the Lowry assay,  a strong alkaline cupric sulfate and tartrate reagent is added to the protein sample 48 
and during a short incubation, light blue tetradentate Cu+ complexes form (the biuret reaction).  These 49 
complexes are formed between Cu2+ and the nitrogen atoms present in the peptide bonds of proteins. 50 
In a secondary reaction, Cu2+ is reduced to Cu+ by the protein peptide bonds (oxidation of peptide 51 
bounds) [5,9] . Following incubation, the yellow Folin -Ciocalteu reagent (phosphotungstic acid and 52 
phosphomolybdic acid m ixture in phenol ) is added and color strengthening occurs. The precise 53 
mechanism for color strengthening  using the Folin -Ciocalteu reagent is not completely understood, 54 
but it is believed to occur when the tetradentate Cu+ complexes transfer electrons to t he 55 
phosphomolybdic -phosphotungstic acid complexes (Cu+ is oxidized back to Cu2+ by Mo6+) [10]. The 56 
reduced phosphomolybdic -phosphotungstic acid complexes produced by this reaction are intensely 57 
blue in color (heteropolymolybdenum Blue (Mo5+)) and can be measured spectrophotometrically at 58 
around 750 nm  [5]. Some specific amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, and cysteine) also contribute to 59 
the color strengthening  by the Folin -Ciocalteu reagent  [11]. Thus, proteins with  higher frequency of 60 
these amino acids will produce stronger color signals.  61 
 62 
The BCA is a modification of the Lowry assay. BCA replace s the Folin -Ciocalteu reagent to generate a 63 
method that is more tolerant to interference by commonly encountered substances present in protein 64 
samples [6]. The advantage of the  BCA is that it is relatively stable under alkaline conditions, unlike the 65 
Lowry assay . Thus, BCA can be incorporated into the alkaline copper solution in a simplified one -step 66 
procedure [6,12] . At room temperature, the readily oxidizable tryptophan, tyrosine, and cysteine or 67 
cystine  are the main amino acids responsible for  Cu2+ reduction  in this assay . At higher temperatures 68 
(37-60°C), Cu2+ is also reduced by protein peptide bonds [6,13] . However, experiments with di -, tri- and 69 
tetrapeptide proteins suggest that the extent of color formation is caused by more than the mere sum 70 
of individual color -producing functional groups in the protein  and that  the peptide backbone likely 71 
contributes as well [13]. In the final step of the reaction, each reduced Cu+ chelates with two molecules 72 
of BCA, forming a purple complex that can be measured spectrophotometrically at around 562 nm 73 
[6,14] .  74 
 75 
In contrast  to the Lowry and BCA assays, the Coomassie Bradford protein assay (Bradford assay) is 76 
based on the binding of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue G -250 dye to protein, which results in protein -dye 77 
complexes [7]. The Bradford assay is the fa stest and simplest  of all protein quantification methods.  The 78 
strong non -covalent binding of the dye  to proteins is due to interactions with hydrophobic amino acids 79 
tryptophan and phenylalanine and the polar amino acid tyrosine. The binding of the neutral species to 80 
proteins also occurs due to electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged sulfonic group of 81 
dye and the positively charged guanidino group of arginine and, to a lesser degree, of the other basic 82 
amino acids, lysine and histidine. Prote in-bound dye molecules shift their absorbance maximum near 83 
615 nm [15], and the increase in absorbance around that wavelength  is proportional to  the number of 84 
bound dye molecules [7].  85 
 86 
All three conventional protein quantification methods have advantages and drawbacks. One of the  87 
clear  drawback s is that they detect all proteins in a given sample and can thus only provide an estimate 88 
for specific protein concentrations when samples contain unpurified or partially purified proteins. 89 
Moreover, all three  methods exhibit some degree of detection varia tion towards different protein 90 
types (protein -to-protein variation) . This can  be attributed to the different reagents ' affinities towards 91 
certain amino acids,  as described above. Indeed,  the determined protein concentrations can be 92 
significantly over - or underestimated  depending on the amino acid composition of the proteins [16], 93 
with the Bradford assay show ing approximately twice as much detection variability compared to the 94 
copper -based protein quantification methods [14]. The BCA and Lowry assays  appear to have very 95 
similar detection variability between different proteins [6].  96 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Another limitation of the se conventional methods is that the proteins must be solubilized to interact 98 
with the assay reagents. This makes the methods susceptible to interference from other substances 99 
present in protein samples. For example, the  Bradford assay is sensitive to surfactants and detergents 100 
(e.g., SDS or Triton X -100) at concentrations routinely used to lyse cells and solubilize membrane 101 
proteins [7]. This is because detergents also bind to proteins and compete w ith the dye for binding 102 
sites, thus preventing the color reaction [17]. The Lowry and BCA assays are compatible with most 103 
surfactants, even if present in the protein sample at concentrations up to 1 % (Lowry assay) or 5 % 104 
(BCA assay) [14]. On the other hand, the Bradford assay is less impacted by substances that reduce 105 
copper (e.g., dithiothreitol or ß -mercaptoethanol) or copper -chelating agents (e.g., EDTA), which are 106 
normally used to stabilize proteins i n solution [7,12] . Buffer solutions that change the pH of the 107 
reagents cause problems for all three conventional protein quantification methods. In general, the 108 
Bradford assay is more tolerant towards interfering substances, like buffer salts, than the Lowry and 109 
BCA assays [18], and the BCA assay is less prone to disr uption than the Lowry assay [6,14] . In addition, 110 
the Bradford reagent is highly acidic, thus, proteins with poor acid -solubility cannot be assayed with 111 
this reagent.  112 
 113 
Another challenge faced by these conventional methods , which we focus on here,  is when proteins are  114 
embedded  in lipid membranes. Transmembrane proteins are largely  embedded in the cell 's 115 
hydrophobic lipid bilayer, with one or more membrane -spanning regions that have hydrophobic amino 116 
acid side chains distributed on the ir surface. Often, these transmembrane proteins have additional 117 
hydrophilic domains located on the extra - and intracellular regions . Membrane proteins have proven 118 
to be difficult to purify owing to their integration in the plasma membrane, partially hydrop hobic 119 
surfaces, flexibility, and lack of stability [19]. Moreover, some transmembrane proteins are only 120 
present in low abundance, and it can be difficult to obtain enough protein for accurate quantification 121 
[20]. The Bradford  assay has already been shown to underestimate the protein concentration of 122 
membrane -containing fractions due to the significant portion of membrane proteins being embedded 123 
in the cell membrane and thus not accessible to the dye molecules  [21]. Therefore, experimental work 124 
with such proteins has often relied on relative protein qua ntification by a combination of Bradford 125 
assays and western blots [22–26]. While these methods can be sufficient for estimating protein 126 
concentrations across samples, they lack the precision needed for producing robust measurements , 127 
especially when target protein concentrat ions vary across biological replicates . Moreover, western 128 
blots are labor -intensive, and not ideal for explicit quantification.  129 
 130 
Enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) present a solution for quantifying large transmembrane 131 
proteins and overcome some of the limitations and drawbacks associated with the conventional 132 
methods. ELISAs are used to quantify specific target proteins in  a sample. Thus, they overcome the 133 
specificity limitations that conventional protein quantification methods face with heterogenous 134 
protein samples. This specificity is achieved in ELISAs through antibody -antigen interactions and an 135 
enzyme -mediated color reaction  to detect the presence of the target protein (antigen). This interaction 136 
allows the quantification of small amounts of a specific target protein in a heterogenous sample 137 
[27,28] . However, due to their specificity, commercial ELISAs for less commonly studied proteins and 138 
for proteins from non-model organism are hard to come by  and cost prohibitive.  139 
 140 
ELISAs follow  the same basic principles  [28,29] . The first step is adhering or immobilizing the target 141 
protein from the liquid phase directly onto the surface of 96 -well plate wells. Fo llowing this, 142 
unsaturated surface -binding sites are blocked by non -reacting protein, such as bovine serum albumin 143 
(BSA). Next, the target protein is detected either directly (enzyme -labeled primary antibody that binds 144 
specifically to the target protein) or  indirectly (such as enzyme -labeled secondary antibody that detects 145 
the primary antibody -target protein interaction). In the final step, substrates for the enzyme are 146 
introduced and enzymatically converted to a chromogenic, fluorescent, or luminescent sign al. The 147 
intensity of the signal directly correlates with the amount of target protein present in the sample.  148 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Three  types of ELISAs have been developed: sandwich, direct, and indirect. A sandwich ELISA is the 150 
most precise method because the target protein is bound between two primary antibodies (capture 151 
antibody and detection antibody), each detecting a different epitope of the target protein. However, 152 
this method requires a lot of tailo ring for each protein type and is thus not easily applicable across a 153 
broad range of proteins. A direct ELISA uses a single primary antibod y, which also serves as the 154 
detection antibody , allowing the direct detection of the target protein.  An indirect ELIS A relies on a  155 
secondary antibody to detect the primary antibody. A standard secondary antibody can be applied to 156 
different primary antibodies, and the primary antibody does not require any labeling. The indirect 157 
ELISA  is thus  the most  easily  applicable met hod. Although a variety of commercial ELISA kits are 158 
available for different proteins, they are expensive, specific for only a narrow range of protein sources 159 
(e.g., rats, mice, humans) and can be ineffective depending on the protein isolation methods.  160 
 161 
To address the challenge of accurate transmembrane protein quantification , we  compare the three 162 
conventional methods (Lowry, BCA, and Bradford) and evaluate their performance in detecting and 163 
quantifying transmembrane proteins in comparison  to an indirect ELISA, which we newly develop ed 164 
and validat e here . We use  Na, K -ATPase (NKA) as our model protein. This transmembrane protein has 165 
been studied extensively in our working group and we have established a high -throughput expression 166 
system to produce NKA  from a wide range of  taxa.  The smallest functional unit of the NKA consists of 167 
a dimer of a large α -subunit with 10 transmembrane helices and a glycosylated β -subunit of one 168 
transmembrane helix [30,31] . 169 
 170 
The ELISA developed for NKA in this paper  makes use of a commercially available primary antibody, 171 
which binds universally across the animal kingdom . Attempts to produce a standard from commercially 172 
available purified NKA proved ineffective. Therefore, we additionally developed a method for 173 
producing relative stan dard s by lyophilizing an aliquot of the protein  being measured . These 174 
specifications allow our ELISA  to be adapted to any protein type and source.  175

Acquiring expression vectors  182 
 183 
The majority of our protein samples were produced by expression in cell culture. This allowed us to 184 
sample from a broader range of taxa. We used six pFastBac Dual plasmids, which have two c loning 185 
sites for the  simultaneous expression of two proteins, containing the  NKA α1- and β1 -subunit genes 186 
from  six different animal species . The species included  the brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus ), common 187 
ostrich ( Struthio camelus ), gold tegu  (Tupinambis teguixin ), large milkweed bug ( Oncopeltus fasciatus ), 188 
Miranda ’s white -lipped frog  (Leptodactylus macrosternum ), and red -necked keelback snake 189 
(Rhabdophis subminiatus ). We selected these species because we wanted to sample as broad a range 190 
of ani mals as possible. All vertebrate vectors were originally produced by Mohammadi et al.,  [1,26,32]  191 
and the large milkweed bug vector was produced by S. Dalla  [32]. Each vector had the α1 -subunit gene 192 
(ATP1A1  for vertebrates, ATP a1C for th e large milkweed bug) under the control of the P PH promoter 193 
and the β -subunit gene (ATP1B1  for vertebrates, b1 for the large milkweed bug) under the p 10 194 
promoter. Accession numbers for the sequences and the Addgene plasmid numbers associated with 195 
these plasmid constructs can be found in Table  S2. 196

 5 The six recombinant plasmids were transposed  into competent DH10Bac Escherichia coli  cells and 200 
grown on plates containing gentamycin , tetracycline, kanamycin , Isopropyl β -D-1- 201 
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) , X-Gal. DH10Bac cells contain a bacmid and a helper plasmid. The 202 
transposed donor plasmid segment containing the inserted ATP1A1 and ATP1B1 genes, along with a 203 
gentamicin resistance gene, recombines  at the lacZ alpha peptide gene  on the bacmid , disrupting its 204 
reading frame . The resulting colonies are white  when grown on plates containing IPTG and X -Gal, 205 
whereas those with intact lacZ proteins , i.e., failed recombination,  are blue. Following transposition , 206 
two white colonies were picked from each plate (per NKA construct) and incubated in liquid culture 207 
cont aining gentamycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin to amplify the recombinant bacmids.  208 
 209 
The amplified  bacmid DNA was isolated from E. coli  cells via alkaline lysis. Briefly, the E. coli  cells were 210 
lysed with a strong  alkaline  solution consisting of 200 mM NaOH  and 1% SDS. Cell debris, SDS, and 211 
genomic DNA was removed by c entrifugation, and the resulting bacmid DNA was pelleted and washed 212 
with 70% ethanol . The pellet was resuspended in  purified water  and the resulting bacmid DNA was 213 
analyzed by PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis to verify that the transposition of the genes of interest 214 
to the bacmids was successful ( Fig. S1 ). The primers used for this analysis were pUC/M13 FWD 5’- 215

Generation of recombinant baculoviruses and expression of NKA proteins in Sf9 cells  218 
 219 
Sf9 cells (immortalized ovary cells from the moth Spodoptera frugiperda ) were used  as the host for 220 
recombinant baculovirus production and protein expression. Sf9 cells are advantageous for NKA 221 
expression because they express very little of the protein endogenously [33,34] .  222 
 223 
We followed the modified one-step protocol described by Scholz  and Suppmann [35]. For baculovirus 224 
production, 8x106 Sf9 cells in 10 mL Insect -Xpress medium with 30 µg/mL gentamycin were transfected 225 
with 10 µg purified bacmid DNA using PEI MAX. We repeated this procedure  three times to produce 226 
three biological replicates (A, B, C) per NKA construct. After 5 days of incubation at 27°C and 110 rpm, 227 
the Sf9 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min and the P0 viruses in the supernatant 228 
were harvested. Freshly seeded Sf9 cells (50x106 cells in 50 mL media) were subsequently infected with 229 
the P0  viruses (500 µL virus per biological replicate). Following three days of incubation at 27°C and 230 
110 rpm, the Sf9 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1650 x g for 10 min and stored at -80°C until 231 
membrane isolation. Additionally, uninfected Sf9 cells (i.e., without NKA expression) were also 232 
cultured (25x106 cells in 50 mL media) and pelleted for use as a negative control.  233 
 234 
Membrane isolation from Sf9 cells  235 
 236 
The frozen Sf9 cell pellets were resuspended in 15 mL of homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 2 237 
mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES; adjusted to pH 7.0 with Tris HCl) on ice. The cell  suspensions  were then 238 
sonicated at 60 W (Sonopuls 2070) for three 45 s intervals on ice to lyse the cells and disrupt the cell 239 
membranes. Next, the cell suspensions were ce ntrifug ed for 30 min at 10,000 x g and 4°C (Centrifuge 240 
5840 R) to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was collected and further centrifuged for 60 min at 241 
146,000  x g and 4°C (Ultra -Centrifuge L -80) to pellet the cell membranes. The supernatant was 242 
removed,  and the pelleted membranes were washed twice and resuspended in cooled HPLC grade 243 
water (1  mL per biological replicate), then stored at -20°C.  244 
 245 
Preparation of tissue samples  246 
 247 
Brain and kidney tissue was dissected from three  freshly frozen black rats purc hased commercially 248 
from frostmaus.de . Nervous tissue (brains, prothoracic and central ganglia) was also dissected out of 249 
14 freshly frozen large milkweed bugs  and pooled into one sample . The bugs were acquired  from a 250 
colony reared at University of Hamburg  [36]. All tissue samples were homogenized on ice with a glass 251 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 6 grinder in 500 µL HPLC grade water . Nervous tissue samples were  lyophilized overnight ( 12-24 h) at 252 
0.1 mbar and -50°C in a freeze dryer. After lyophilization, the freeze -dried samples  were reconstituted 253 
in 500 µL (large milkweed bug) or 1 mL (black rat) cooled HPLC grade water. The reconstituted samples 254 
were then sonicated in an ice bath for  10 min (Omni Sonic Ruptor 400, Pulser 90, Power 90%) and 255 
centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 x g and 4°C (Centrifuge 5840 R) to precipitate debris. The resulting 256 
supernatant was stored at -20°C. Membranes from kidney samples were isolated as described above  257 
for Sf9 cells. Nervous tissue is known to have very high levels of NKA expression compared to other 258 
tissues [37–40]. Therefore, we deemed it unnecessary to concentrate the proteins by isolating  259 
membranes for this tissue.   260

Testing the effect of lyophilization on antibody detection  273 
 274 
We wanted to prepare relative standards for our ELISA by using the dry weight of lyophilized protein 275 
samples containing NKA from different species. We therefore first tested  whether lyophilizing NKA 276 
would cause a reduction in their detection by antibodies . For this comparison we used a 300 µL aliquot 277 
of membrane isolated samples derived from Sf9 cell expression ( Table 1 ), which  consisted of 100 µL of 278 
each replicate (A -C) pooled together. For c ommon ostrich and Miranda 's white -lipped frog, 162.5 µL 279 
of replicates A and B were pooled because the C replicate s were contaminated during the preparation 280 
process . The samples were dried  overnight (12 -24 h) at 0.1 mbar and -50°C in a freeze dryer. 281 
Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged shortly and their weights calculated by subtracti ng the 282 
weight of the empty tubes . The freeze -dried samples  were then reconstituted in 200 -300 µL cooled 283 
HPLC grade water. An aliquot was taken from each sample for the downstream production of relative 284 
standards .  285 
 286 
For the western blot analysis, 2.5 μL of non -lyophilized and reconstituted lyophilized sample s were 287 
solubilized in 8 μL 4x Laemmli buffer (62.5 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8; 2 % SDS; 10 % glycerol; 5 % 2 - 288 
mercaptoethanol;  0.001 % Bromophenol Blue) and 21.5 μL Millipore water. The solubilized samples 289 
were then separated  on an SDS gel containing 10% acrylamide. Subsequently, the separated proteins 290 
were blotted from the gel on to nitrocellulose membrane. To block unsaturated binding sites on the 291 
membranes after blotting, they were incubated at room tempera ture in 1x BlueBlock PF on a plate 292 
tipper at medium tipping speed for 1 h. After blocking, the membranes were transferred into a 50 mL 293 
Falcon tube and incubated with 2 mL of the primary antibody ( Table S1 ) at a concentration of 0.88 294 
μg/mL in 1x BlueBlock P F overnight at 4°C on a tube rotator. Next, the membranes were washed three 295 
times with 1x BlueBlock PF. The membranes were then incubated with 2 mL of the secondary antibody 296 
(Table S1 ) at a concentration of 8 μg/mL in 1x BlueBlock PF for 1 h at room temper ature on the tube 297 
rotator. Next, t he membranes were washed three times with 1x BlueBlock PF and two additional times 298 
with 0.05 M Tris HCl for 5 min each. The antibody complexes were stained by moving the membranes 299 
into a glass petri dish  and adding the detection enzyme  substrate (0.035 % H 2O2, and 0.01 % 4 -Chloro - 300 
1-naphthol in 0.05 M, pH 7.5 Tris HCl) . Following a 10 min  incubat ion, the staining reaction was  stopped  301 
by washing the membrane with deionized water. The resultant membranes were sc anned (Canon 302 
9000F Mark II). These samples were also compared on our ELISA (described below) and the results 303 
from both the western blot and ELISA were statistically compared (described below).  See Table S3  for 304 
raw data.  305 
 306 
Protein assays   307 
 308 
All the protein samples we produced were quantified by Lowry, BCA, Bradford , and ELISA . The 309 
commercial porcine sample was used as a positive control, and the protein sample derived from 310 
untransfected Sf9 cells was used as a negative control. All four  assays wer e run on aliquots that were 311 
not previously freeze -thawed.  312 
 313 
Lowry protein assay  314 
 315 
We used Thermo Fisher Scientific 's Modified Lowry protein assay kit  (Table S1 ). First, a standard curve 316 
was prepared with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (1500, 1000, 750, 500, 250, 125, 25, 5, 1, and 0 μg/mL) 317 (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

 8 in Millipore water. The protein samples were diluted 1:10 in Millipore water, except for porcine and 318 
large milkweed bug tissue s amples, which were not diluted because low protein content was expected 319 
in these samples. 40 μL of the standards and protein samples were pipetted in duplicate (two technical 320 
replicates) into 96 -well polystyrene flat -well plate wells. 200 µL of Lowry reage nt was added to each 321 
well, mixed on a microplate shaker for 30 seconds, and then incubated at room temperature for 10 322 
min. Following incubation, 20 μL of freshly prepared 1 x Folin -Ciocalteu reagent was added to each well 323 
and mixed on the microplate shaker for 30 seconds. Following a 30 min room temperature incubation, 324 
the absorbance of standards and protein samples was measured at 655 nm using a microplate 325 
absorbance reader (Bio -Rad Model 680).  See Table S 4 for raw Lowry assay data.  326 
 327 
Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay  328 
 329 
We used  Thermo Fisher Scientific 's Bicinchoninic acid protein assay  kit (Table S1 ). First, a standard 330 
curve was prepared with BSA (1500, 1000, 750, 500, 250, 125, 25, 5, 1, and 0 μg/mL) in Millipore water. 331 
The protei n samples were diluted 1:10 in Millipore water, except for porcine and large milkweed bug 332 
tissue samples, which were not diluted .  25 μL of the standards and protein samples were pipetted in 333 
duplicate (two technical replicates) i nto 96 -well polystyrene flat -well plate wells. 200 µL of freshly 334 
prepared, clear, green BCA working reagent was added to each well, and mixed on a microplate shaker 335 
for 30 seconds. Following a 30 min incubation at 37°C and subsequent cooling of the plate t o room 336 
temperature, the absorbance of standards and protein samples was measured at 550 nm using a 337 
microplate absorbance reader (Bio -Rad Model 680).  See Table S 5 for raw BCA assay data.  338 
 339 
Coomassie Bradford protein assay  340 
 341 
For the Bradford assay, we prepared a standard curve with BSA (10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 μg/mL) in Millipore 342 
water. The protein samples derived from Sf9 cells and rat brain tissue were diluted 1:2000 in Millipore 343 
water, whereas porcine and large milkweed bug t issue samples were diluted 1:200 (see methods 344 
above ). Both the standards and protein samples were then diluted 1:2 with Coomassie Bradford 345 
reagent and pipetted into polystyrene cuvettes in duplicate (two technical replicates). After incubating  346 
at room temp erature  for 10 mins , the absorbance of standards and protein samples was measured at 347 
595 nm using a cuvette spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 2100 pro).  See Table S 6 for raw Bradford assay 348 
data.  349

Relative NKA standard preparation for the ELISA  351 
 352 
For each animal species to be assayed, a relative NKA standard was prepared from the  lyophiliz ed 353 
membrane isolates derived from  Sf9 cell s (Fig. 1 ). The c oncentration of each standard was  calculated 354 
based on the ir lyophilized weights  (described above) . These concentrations were used to create 355 
relative NKA standard stock aliquots of 1 mg/mL in ELISA coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO 3 in PBS, adjusted 356 
to pH 9.5 with KOH ; Table S7) for each animal species.  357

Schematic diagram illustrating the isolation of proteins from (A) recombinant expression in 361 Sf9 cells and (B) from tissues. Nervous tissue samples were isolated by homogenization, followed by 362 centrifugation to pellet waste and lyophilization, whereas all other samples were membrane isolated. 363 Relative Na, K-ATPase (NKA) standards were subsequently prepared from a subset of membrane 364 isolates from recombinantly expressed Sf9 cells. All resulting protein samples were used in all four 365 quantification assays, while the relative NKA standards were produced specifically for the ELISA. Figure 366 created with BioRender.com. 367  368  369 Indirect ELISA to quantify NKA proteins 370  371 Prior to running an ELISA, the protein samples were diluted 1:2000 in the coating buffer (Table S7). 372 Replicates A-C of common ostrich and large milkweed bug were diluted 1:6000 and 1:4000, 373 respectively, because higher NKA concentrations were expected in these samples based on the 374 western blots. The 1 mg/mL relative NKA standard stocks were sonicated in an ice bath for two 2.5-375 min intervals (Omni Sonic Ruptor 400, Pulser 90, Power 90%) and afterwards the standards were 376 diluted in coating buffer to the following concentrations: 60, 30, 20, 15, 10, 7.5, 5, 3.75, 2.5, 1.875, 377 1.25, 0.9375, 0.625, and 0 μg/mL. All ELISAs were run on aliquots that were not previously freeze-378 thawed. 379  380 First, 100 μL of protein samples and relative NKA standards were added to 96-well polystyrene flat-381 well plates in duplicate (two technical replicates). Additionally, 100 μL of a negative control using only 382 coating buffer without any protein was added to the plates. This negative control is equal to the 0 383 μg/mL standard. After adding samples and standards to the wells, the plates were sealed with 384 Parafilm® and incubated overnight at 4°C (12-18 h).  385  386 The next day, unbound leftovers were discarded and plates dried by tapping them several times face-387 down on a paper towel. Each well was washed by adding 400 μL of washing buffer (0.05 % Tween® 20 388 in PBS; Table S7), letting it sit for 10 s, then discarding fluids as described above. This washing 389 procedure was repeated to a total of five times. Next, unsaturated surface-binding sites were blocked 390 by adding 200 μL of blocking buffer (1 % BSA, 0.02 % Tween® 20 in PBS; Table S7) to each well, sealing 391 the plates with Parafilm®, and incubating at room temperature for 2 h. Following blocking, the wells 392 were washed as described above.  393 
A
B  10  394 We used the universal monoclonal primary antibody α5 to detect the NKA α-subunit (α5-antibody; 395 Table S1). The antigen species for this antibody is chicken and the host species is mouse. The α5-396 antibody binds a cytosolic epitope on the α-subunit of all NKA isoforms across the animal kingdom. 50 397 μL of primary antibody solution containing 2 μg/mL α5-antibody in blocking buffer was added to each 398 well, and left to incubate, sealed with Parafilm®, for 1 h at room temperature (overnight (12-18 h) at 399 4°C is also possible).  400  401 To remove unbound primary antibodies, the wells were washed as described above. Next, we used a 402 goat-anti-mouse polyclonal secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP-403 antibody; Table S1) to detect the primary antibody. The host species for the secondary antibody is 404 goat. 50 μL of secondary antibody solution containing 5 μg/mL HRP- antibody in blocking buffer was 405 added to each well, and left to incubate, sealed with Parafilm®, for 1 h at room temperature.  406  407 Following the secondary antibody incubation, each well was washed seven times as described above 408 to maximally reduce background noise caused by unbound HRP-antibody. The colorimetric reaction of 409 HRP was triggered by adding 100 μL 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to each well, and allowing 410 color development at room temperature for 10 min. The colorimetric reaction was stopped by adding 411 100 μL stopping solution (0.5 M H2SO4) to each well. Finally, the absorbance of standards and protein 412 samples was measured at 490 nm using a microplate absorbance reader (Bio-Rad iMarkTM). See Fig. 2 413 for a schematic diagram of the ELISA methods and Table S7 for buffer recipes. 414  415  416

  11 Several negative controls were included to validate the functionality of this ELISA. First, the primary 425 antibody (α5-antibody) was omitted to confirm that there is no non-specific binding of the secondary 426 HRP-antibody. Next, the HRP-antibody was omitted to confirm that TMB and the stopping solution do 427 not stain non-specifically (i.e., without HRP). For these negative controls, a random sample from our 428 Sf9 expressed proteins was used (gold tegu replicate A). Then, both protein and antibodies were 429 omitted to confirm that there is no background noise caused by the buffers. Finally, membrane isolate 430 of uninfected Sf9 cells was run in the ELISA to confirm that the antibodies are not binding non-431 specifically to other membrane proteins. See Table S8 for raw negative control data. 432  433 Calculation of protein concentrations 434  435 For all protein quantification methods, the average absorbance of the two blank standard replicates 436 (0 µg/mL) was subtracted from each absorbance measurement. Then, the average values of the two 437 technical replicates were calculated. The average absorbance values of each standard were used for a 438 linear trendline-fitting. For the ELISA, either the entire range up to 60 μg/mL (red-necked keelback 439 snake, commercial porcine NKA) or concentrations ranging from 0 to 10, 20, or 30 µg/mL were used, 440 depending on the extent of the linear range of the standard curves. The resulting linear equations were 441 used to calculate the protein concentrations of the samples. See Table S9 for raw ELISA data. 442  443 Testing the robustness of protein quantification methods with in vitro NKA activity assays 444  445 To examine the robustness of the determined protein or NKA concentrations, the variation across 446 biological replicates of in vitro NKA activity assays were compared. Only animal species with three or 447 more biological replicates were tested in the NKA activity assays. Thus, Miranda's white-lipped frog 448 and large milkweed bug tissue were excluded from the assays. Replicate C of Miranda’s white-lipped 449 frog encountered infection problems during transfection whereas the number of large milkweed bugs 450 we dissected was only sufficient to produce only one biological replicate for the tissue. For each assay, 451 100 μg of protein was used and this was calculated based on concentrations determined by the four 452 different protein quantification methods. The 100 μg of protein was pipetted in duplicate (two 453 technical replicates) into two wells on a 96-well polystyrene flat-well plate. The first well contained 454 stabilizing buffer to measure total ATPase activity and the second well contained inhibiting buffer 455 (lacking KCl and including 10-2 M ouabain) to block NKAs and measure background ATPase activity. See 456 assay buffer formulas in Petschenka et al. [41]. The proteins were incubated at 37°C and 200 rpms for 457 10 min on a microplate shaker. 458  459 Next, ATP (10 mM Tris-ATP, pH 6.5) was added to each well and the proteins were incubated again at 460 37°C and 200 rpms for 20 min. The activity of NKAs was determined by quantification of inorganic 461 phosphate (Pi) released from enzymatically hydrolyzed ATP. Reaction Pi levels were measured 462 according to the procedure described by Petschenka et al. [41]. The reactions were stopped with 10 % 463 SDS and then stained with a solution consisting of Taussky-Shorr color reagent [42], which turned the 464 reactions blue in proportion to their Pi concentration. After 10 min of staining, the absorbance of each 465 well was measured at 655 nm using a microplate absorbance reader (Bio-Rad Model 680). Average 466 absorbance values of the two technical replicates were used for subsequent calculations.  467  468 The averages of two technical replicates were translated to mM Pi based on a standard curve of KH2PO4 469 (0 - 1.2 mM Pi) that was run on the same plate. Background ATPase Pi concentrations were subtracted 470 to obtain NKA ATPase Pi concentrations [41]. The Pi concentrations released from 100 μg of protein 471 were then converted to nmol Pi/(mg protein*min).  472  473 Statistical analyses 474  475   12 To test whether lyophilization alters NKA detection by antibodies, we compared the distribution of 476 ELISA absorbance values between lyophilized and non-lyophilized samples with a Wilcoxon signed-477 rank test for paired samples. In addition, we compared the densities of the western blot's NKA α-478 subunit bands (~110 kDa) between the two treatments using ImageJ 1.53k to draw plots from the 479 signal strength and size of the western blot bands. From the resulting plots, the areas under the curves 480 were calculated [43]. We then compared the distribution of the areas under the curves between 481 lyophilized and non-lyophilized samples with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples. For both 482 analyses, the values for all samples were pooled together based on the treatment. 483  484 We used a Friedman rank sum test for paired samples to compare the NKA detection capabilities of 485 the four different quantification methods. We first compared the concentration values between Sf9 486 and tissue derived samples and found a significant difference (Wilcoxon paired test; p < 0.0001). We 487 thus continued by analyzing Sf9 and tissue derived samples separately. The positive control 488 (commercial porcine sample), the negative control (uninfected Sf9 cells), and replicate C of Miranda's 489 white-lipped frog (which was infected by bacteria in cell culture) were excluded from this analysis. For 490 the remaining, determined protein concentrations of different samples were pooled for each 491 quantification method respectively. A two-sided Dunn's post hoc test (R package "rstatix" [44]) was 492 used to identify the quantification methods that significantly differ from one another in the distribution 493 of their determined protein concentrations. Since multiple pairwise comparisons were performed 494 simultaneously in this test, the Bonferroni adjustment method was used for controlling the family-wise 495 error rate.  496  497 To evaluate the robustness of the determined NKA concentrations across the four methods, a one-way 498 analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the mean variation (scatter) in NKA activities 499 (specified by standard deviation of ATPase activity) across the three biological replicates (A, B, C). The 500 NKA activity assays were based on 100 μg of protein calculated from concentrations determined by 501 the four quantification methods. In the ANOVA, animal species was considered a random effect. Also, 502 standard deviations and coefficients of variation of different animal species were pooled for each 503 quantification method respectively. A power analysis (R package "pwr" [45]) revealed high power (>99 504 %) of the ANOVA to detect true effects or differences in the data. The black rat brain and kidney tissue 505 samples were excluded from the analysis, because the amount of Pi released from these samples was 506 beyond the linear range of the Pi standard curve. Despite running several additional rounds with more 507 diluted samples, we were never able to capture an activity range within the Pi standards before using 508 up the tissue samples.   509  510 All statistical analyses were performed using R 4.1.1 software (R Core Team, 2021) and a significance 511 level of 0.05 was applied. See Supplementary Dataset 1 for data table used for statistical comparisons. 512  513 3. Results  514  515 Lyophilization does not affect NKA detection by antibodies 516  517 To test whether lyophilization affects the detection of NKA by the ELISA antibodies, we compared Sf9 518 membrane isolates that were lyophilized to their non-lyophilized counterparts on a western blot (Fig. 519 3A) and in the ELISA. We analyzed the distribution of the western blot band densities and found no 520 significant difference between lyophilized and non-lyophilized samples (Wilcoxon signed-rank paired 521 test; p = 0.81; W = 16; n = 7; Fig. 3B). The ELISA corroborated the same result (Wilcoxon signed-rank 522 paired test; p = 0.08; W = 25; n = 7; Fig. 3B); showing no significant difference in the distribution of the 523 absorbance values between the two treatments. These results confirm that lyophilization of Sf9 cell 524 membrane isolates does not significantly diminish the detectability of the NKA proteins by the 525 antibodies used in the ELISA.  526  527   13  528  529 Figure 3. (A) Western blot membrane scans show lyophilized and non-lyophilized Sf9 cell membrane 530 isolates run on two gels. The 110 kDa line corresponds to the NKA’s α-subunit, which is marked by an 531 arrow. Because the α5 primary antibody is specific only to the NKA α-subunit, additional bands and 532 smearing are most likely caused by higher order complexes and high protein load. The + and – indicate 533 which bands are lyophilized (+) and which are not (–). (B) Comparison of detection intensity between 534 lyophilized and non-lyophilized Sf9 membrane isolates in the western blot and ELISA analyses. 535 Densities of the western blot's NKA α-subunit bands were determined by the areas under the curves 536 in ImageJ (Fig. S3; Table S3).  537  538 Relative NKA standard curves vary between different animal species 539  540 Because the α5 antibody can have different binding affinities to NKA from different animals, we 541 produced a standard curve for each species. These standards were prepared from NKA expressed in 542 Sf9 cells for consistency and reproducibility. In addition, we prepared standards from commercial 543 porcine NKA. We found that most standard curves reached saturation well before the higher 544

  14 concentration range (0 μg/mL to 60 μg/mL; Fig. 4A). Omitting the saturated range allowed us to 545 capture the linear range needed for appropriate concentration calculations (Fig. 4B). The red-necked 546 keelback snake standard was an exception to this pattern, for which a linear curve fit over the entire 547 range of standards (Fig. 4A) – this is likely due to it having very low levels of NKA expression and thus 548 lower amounts of NKA per mg lyophilized membrane isolate (Fig. S2). The standards prepared from 549 commercial porcine NKA exhibited similarly low detectability by the α5 antibody. This was, however, 550 surprising because the commercial porcine sample contains only NKA in membrane fragments and 551 thus each mg is pure NKA. Because of the high variation, having standards tailored to each animal 552 group ensures that the concentrations of samples are not over- or underestimated in the ELISA. 553  554

(B) Omitting the 560 saturated range allowed us to capture the linear range of the standard curves, which were 561 subsequently used for calculating NKA concentrations. 562  563 NKA detection is minimal to absent in negative controls 564  565 To assess the specificity of the antibodies used in the ELISA, several negative controls, which excluded 566 different components of the ELISA, were tested. We set the detection threshold to 0.034, which is the 567 average absorbance value of the reagents used in the ELISA (containing neither protein nor antibody). 568 We found that the absorbance of the negative control containing no protein (i.e., membrane isolate) 569 remained within this detection threshold (Fig. 5; Table S8). The negative control containing no HRP-570 conjugated secondary antibody fell slightly above this threshold. The negative control containing no 571 primary α5-antibody minimally exceeded the detection threshold, which indicates that there is slight 572 background noise caused by the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. This is likely caused by unbound 573 secondary antibody that remains in the well after repeated washing. In addition to these negative 574 controls, we tested the NKA-specificity of the primary α5-antibody using membrane isolates of 575 untransfected Sf9 cells, which express very little NKA endogenously [33,34]. There was some detection 576 of NKAs in these membranes. This is expected because these cells express a small level of these 577 proteins endogenously. In addition, untransfected cells have higher cell proliferation and thus 578 membranes isolated from these samples will have a higher density of membranes than those isolated 579 from transfected cells. Nevertheless, the detection of NKAs in samples derived from transfected Sf9 580 cells exceeded untransfected cells by more than two-fold (Fig. 5). Together, these results confirm that 581 the specificity of the ELISA for NKA is suitable.  582  583

Each bar represents the average of two technical 589 replicates from one biological replicate. 590  591 Conventional protein quantification methods cannot sufficiently quantify NKA  592  593 Our comparisons between protein quantification methods revealed several notable patterns (Fig. 6A). 594 In general, there was strong interspecies variation in protein concentrations among samples quantified 595 by ELISA, which ranged between 1.39 to 145.89 mg/mL. This variation was not as pronounced across 596 the samples quantified by conventional methods, which all-together ranged between 0.55 to 18.27 597 mg/mL (Supplementary Dataset 1). The absence of stark variation among the conventional 598 quantification methods strongly points towards their inability to robustly quantify NKA, and possibly 599 all transmembrane proteins. 600  601 Importantly, the positive control consisting of purified porcine NKA revealed that all three conventional 602 quantification methods determined protein concentrations much lower (<1.5 mg/mL) than its actual 603 concentration (10 mg/mL) (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Dataset 1). In contrast, the ELISA determined a 604 concentration 16.91 mg/mL, which is not only higher than the conventional methods but also exceeds 605 the predicted concentration based on lyophilized weight.  All four quantification methods determined 606 approximately the same concentrations in the negative control consisting of membrane isolates from 607 untransfected Sf9 cells (Fig. 6B). Since untransfected cells have higher viability, the rather high 608 detected protein concentrations reflect the higher overall protein content resulting from higher cell 609 density. Taken together, these results suggest that the three conventional protein quantification 610 methods significantly underestimate the concentration of NKA in a given sample, and likely other large 611 transmembrane proteins. 612

We found 623 that the protein concentration distributions for recombinantly expressed proteins were significantly 624 different between the four methods (Friedman rank sum paired test; p < 0.001; χ2 = 36.53; df = 3; n = 625 15; Fig. 7A), with the ELISA having determined significantly higher protein concentrations compared to 626 all three conventional methods (Dunn’s post-hoc test; Table S10). In contrast, the three conventional 627 methods did not significantly differ in their determined protein concentrations. Remarkably, the wide 628 range of NKA concentration differences detected by the ELISA was undetectable by the conventional 629 methods, which is clearly illustrated by the stark difference in box blots (Fig. 7A). This indicates that 630 using a transmembrane protein standard in place of the conventional BSA in the conventional methods 631 would not be effective. We also found a marginally significant difference in protein concentration 632 distributions for tissue-isolated samples (p = 0.006; χ2 = 12.6; df = 3; n = 9; Fig. 7B). However, a post-633 hoc Dunn’s test could not detect significant differences between any of the comparison pairs (Table 634 S10). We did not observe as wide a range of concentration differences in the ELISA on tissue samples. 635 This is likely due to tissue samples only covering two species (black rat and large milkweed bug). 636  637

Different letters indicate significant 646 differences in the distribution of determined protein concentrations at p < 0.05 (Dunn's test).  647  648 Quantification with ELISA consistently produces more robust downstream ATPase assay data  649  650 To test whether the differences in protein quantification accuracy we uncovered affect downstream 651 in vitro functional assays, ATPase activity assays were run based on protein concentrations determined 652 by the four quantification methods. We tested whether the resulting variation in NKA ATPase activities 653 (specified by standard deviation of NKA activity) significantly differs between the four quantification 654 methods.  655  656 We did not detect a significant effect of protein quantification method on the mean standard deviation 657 of NKA activities (ANOVA; p = 0.186; F = 1.882; n = 5; Fig. 8A). Although not statistically detectable, the 658 variation in NKA activities of all ELISA samples is consistently low compared to those of the 659 conventional methods, suggesting that the ELISA provides robust NKA quantification. Western blots of 660 the recombinantly expressed NKA show that expression levels were even across biological replicates 661 (Fig. S2). This indicates that overall protein content would be even within samples, and thus reduce 662 variation in activity based on concentrations determined by the conventional methods. 663  664 Of note, activity measurements of the large milkweed bug NKA resulted in stark differences between 665 the ELISA and conventional methods (Fig. 8B). The high activity associated with the conventional 666 methods is due to them detecting very low concentrations of the milkweed bug proteins, resulting in 667 more protein being added to the activity assay reaction, and subsequently higher measured activity. 668 In contrast, the ELISA detected rather high NKA concentrations in the large milkweed bug, which 669 resulted in less protein being used for the activity assays, and thus lower activity measurements. This 670 pattern can be seen across samples but is most pronounced in the milkweed bug.  671  672 In contrast to the Sf9 derived samples, the NKA activities of tissues derived samples deviate from this 673 pattern, showing high variation across all four quantification methods. Almost all the activity values of 674 tissue samples fell far beyond the linear range of the Pi standard curve. Thus, we could not make 675 accurate activity estimates for most of these samples. For this reason, they were excluded from the 676 ANOVA analysis.  677   19  678 Figure 8.

Discussion 691  692 The overarching aim of this paper was to find a reliable method for quantifying large transmembrane 693 proteins. We focused on the NKA as a model and we developed an ELISA that can be easily adapted 694 across protein types and sources (i.e., species). We assessed the specificity of our ELISA in comparisons 695 to commonly used conventional quantification methods (Lowry, BCA, and Bradford) and found that all 696 conventional methods are unsuitable for quantifying NKA. If the conventional methods, which should 697 detect all proteins in a given sample, quantify transmembrane proteins efficiently, then the protein 698

  20 concentrations determined by these methods should be significantly higher than those determined by 699 the NKA-specific ELISA. Contrary to this expectation, we found that the ELISA consistently determined 700 higher protein concentrations in all the protein samples. Notably, the concentration of the positive 701 control, which consisted of pure NKA in membrane fragments, was grossly underestimated by the 702 conventional quantification methods—to the point where it was almost completely undetected (Fig. 703 6B). These outcomes are a clear indication that the Lowry, BCA, and Bradford assays cannot detect 704 transmembrane proteins. It is also important to point out that the ELISA also strongly underestimated 705 the concentration of the pure porcine NKA (Fig. 6B). This commercially available protein is purified 706 from porcine nervous tissue. According to the manufacturer, the primary α5-antibody, which we use 707 in the ELISA, is capable of binding to a cytosolic epitope on the NKA α-subunit of all isoforms across 708 the animal kingdom. However, it is possible that the α5-antibody binds more strongly to isoform α1 709 (ATP1A1), which we expressed in Sf9 cells, than to α3 (ATP1A3), which is the main isoform expressed 710 in nervous tissue [46]. To confirm this hypothesis, it would be prudent to test the antibody’s ability to 711 detect α1 and α3 isoforms expressed and isolated from Sf9 cells.  712  713 There are several possible explanations for why the conventional quantification methods are 714 inefficient at detecting transmembrane proteins. We rule out interfering substances, such as 715 detergents, as a likely explanation for the inefficiency of the conventional methods because we used 716 HPLC grade water for the resuspension of isolated proteins. We can also rule out glycosylation as a 717 possible source of interference. Whereas glycosylation can lead to over- (Lowry and BCA) or 718 underestimation (Bradford) of protein concentrations [47] and the NKA β-subunit is highly glycolyzed, 719 our results consistently show underestimation of proteins by the conventional methods.  720  721 The most likely explanation has to do with the fact that the main detection molecules of the 722 conventional protein quantification methods, CBB and Cu2+, are not able to penetrate the hydrophobic 723 cell membrane [21]. Isolated transmembrane proteins are embedded in membrane fragments and 724 therefore the embedded portion of the protein is not accessible to CBB and Cu2+ molecules, which bind 725 to specific amino acids on the protein surface. This would consequently result in underestimated 726 protein concentrations, and even more so considering that the protein standards for the conventional 727 methods consist of non-membrane proteins. Although penetrating the cell membrane should be less 728 of a barrier for the Lowry method because its alkaline reaction can disrupt cell membranes through 729 hydrolysis, the results did not show higher detectability by this method compared to the other two 730 (Fig. 7). In contrast, the α5-antibody of the ELISA binds to an epitope on the NKA α-subunit located 731 outside the cell membrane. Therefore, the detection pathway of the ELISA is not hindered by the 732 membrane and the resulting concentration measurement reflects a reliable estimate of the number of 733 NKA molecules in the sample. A possible alternative would be to produce the relative standards as 734 described for our ELISA and use them in conjunction with one of the conventional methods. However, 735 the very low detectability of our positive control by these methods casts doubts on whether a reliable 736 standard curve can be obtained with transmembrane proteins. 737  738 One unexpected outcome of these experiments is that all quantification methods detected lower 739 protein concentrations in the tissue-derived samples compared to the recombinantly expressed Sf9 740 cell-derived samples. It is possible that the lowered detection of proteins in tissue sample is due to 741 differences in the membrane composition, or co- and post-transcriptional modifications of Sf9 cells 742 and tissue cells, which might alter the accessibility of the epitope to the primary α5-antibody. In this 743 case, the tissue sample concentrations would also be lowered as a result of using relative standard 744 curves produced from Sf9 cell derived NKA. The stark difference in detectability of rat NKA from 745 recombinantly expressed Sf9 cells and from kidney tissue, both of which consist of the rat isoform α1 746 (ATP1A1), supports this hypothesis.  747  748 The NKA activity assays, which were run based on protein concentrations determined by the different 749 quantification methods, helped to serve as an additional robustness assessment of the methods. The 750   21 activity data of Sf9 cell-derived NKA showed consistently low variation across all animal species when 751 the NKA activity assays were based on ELISA-determined protein concentrations (Fig. 8). The NKA 752 activity assays based on concentrations determined by the three conventional methods exhibited 753 different levels of variation across animal species—meaning that some animal species exhibited low 754 variation in NKA activities while others exhibited high variation (Fig. 8). Due to these overlaps, it was 755 not possible to detect a statistical difference between NKA activity variation in ELISA-based and other 756 quantification method-based data. According to the ELISA, the determined NKA concentrations of 757 protein samples derived from Sf9 cells were quite similar across the three biological replicates of each 758 animal species. The conventional methods determined protein concentrations that were considerably 759 lower, but, as with ELISA, they differ only slightly across biological replicates. This, in turn, resulted in 760 lower variation in NKA activities for the conventional methods. The even NKA expression across 761 biological replicates, as seen on the western blots (Fig. S2), further corroborate why no statistical 762 difference was detected in the NKA activity variation between the four protein quantification methods. 763 If NKA expression levels were uneven across biological replicates, then we would have expected to see 764 more variation in the resulting activity data based on the conventional methods. 765  766 Of note, we found that the NKA activity assays of tissue-derived samples exhibited very high variation 767 across the board. This was likely due to the absorbance values measured for the activity assays 768 exceeding the linear range of the Pi standard curve, making accurate quantification of phosphate 769 released from the hydrolysis of ATP impossible. There are two possible explanations for this outcome. 770 The first is that NKAs derived from tissue have a higher catalytic activity than those expressed 771 recombinantly. When the NKA activity is very high, then considerably less protein would be needed in 772 the NKA activity assay to fall within the detectable range of the standard curve. Another explanation 773 is that all four quantification methods, including the ELISA, severely underestimated the total NKA 774 concentrations in tissue-derived samples, as was discussed previously. When the NKA concentration is 775 underestimated, then more protein is used in the NKA activity assay, driving the NKA activity levels 776 beyond the linear range of the standard curve. Despite numerous rounds of dilutions, we were never 777 able to capture activity levels that fell within the standards range for our tissue-derived samples. 778  779 As part of the functional validation of the ELISA, several negative controls were run to test non-specific 780 background noise in the ELISA. The negative control containing only NKA and the secondary HRP-781 antibody ("no α5-antibody") showed a slightly higher absorbance than the detection threshold (Fig. 5). 782 This minimal background noise most likely results from HRP-antibodies that remain in the wells after 783 washing. For this reason, the number of wash steps following HRP-antibody incubation is higher than 784 the rest of the washing steps. The absorbances of the other negative controls containing no HRP-785 conjugated secondary antibody or no protein sample did not exceed the detection threshold, 786 indicating that TMB and the stopping solution do not stain non-specifically and that non-specific 787 binding of the antibodies to the wells is not an issue in this ELISA.  788  789 Another important validation step involved confirming by western blot and ELISA that lyophilization 790 does not alter the detectability of NKA by the antibodies used in the ELISA, thereby ensuring that the 791 standards will not be detected differently than the fresh protein samples. Verifying that lyophilized cell 792 membrane isolates can be used to produce relative protein standards is important considering how 793 different the relative NKA standard curves can look for different animal species (Fig. 4). Without 794 producing a standard curve for each animal species, the determined NKA concentrations would be 795 biased towards the detectability of the protein’s animal species origin and thus significantly over- or 796 underestimate NKA content in different samples. These interspecies differences are due to the α5-797 antibody binding at different efficiencies with different animal species (Fig. 4; Fig. S2). 798  799 Overall, our results indicate that the ELISA is the most suitable quantification method for the NKA, and 800 most likely other large transmembrane proteins as well. The ELISA validated here can be easily adapted 801 to other transmembrane proteins by exchanging the primary and, if necessary, the secondary 802   22 antibody. Moreover, it is straightforward to prepare relative protein standards that can be adapted to 803 a wide taxonomic range and multiple sample types. This method eliminates the need for commercially 804 available ELISA kits, which are more limited in these regards and can be quite costly. 805  806 Acknowledgements  807  808 We thank M.
