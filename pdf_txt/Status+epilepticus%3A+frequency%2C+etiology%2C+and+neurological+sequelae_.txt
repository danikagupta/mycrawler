Review
246 http://neurology.thelancet.com Vol 5    March 2006Introduction
In this review we will focus exclusively on major motor
(convulsive) status epilepticus in adults. Complex partialand other forms of status epilepticus are well covered inSimon Shorvon’s Status Epilepticus ,
1in several recent
reviews,2–9and in an upcoming volume edited by one of
us.10
The earliest known description of status epilepticus
was in the 25th and 26th tablets of the Sakikkucuneiform of the Neo-Babylonian era, written during718–612 BC.
1Status epilepticus is Bazire’s latin
translation of “Etat de mal”,11a term coined by the
patients of Bicetre and the Salpêtrière, and introduced inpublished medical work in Louis Calmeil’s doctoralthesis.
12
In 1876, Bourneville deﬁned status epilepticus as
more or less incessant seizures.13Clark and Prout14
described the natural course of status epilepticus in 38patients unaffected by anticonvulsants. They recognisedthree phases: an early pseudostatus phase (described asaborted, imperfect, or incomplete); convulsive status;and stuporous status. Data
15,16support Clark and Prout’s
concept, and we propose calling the three phasesimpending, established, and subtle status epilepticus. 
Gastaut
17stated that “there are as many types of status
as there are types of epileptic seizures” and deﬁnedstatus epilepticus as “a term used whenever a seizurepersists for a sufﬁcient length of time or is repeatedfrequently enough to produce a ﬁxed or enduringepileptic condition”.
18However, status epilepticus is
never truly “ﬁxed”, and this deﬁnition is not easilytranslated into clinical trials or into everyday practice.Furthermore, research with animals shows thatrepetitive seizures become self-sustaining andpharmacoresistant within 15–30 min
15,19and can lead to
neuronal injury at about the same time.20The duration
of what is accepted as status epilepticus has beenshrinking progressively from 30 min in the guidelines ofthe Epilepsy Foundation of America’s Working Groupon Status Epilepticus
21to 20 min,22to 10 min in the
Veterans Affairs Status Epilepticus Cooperation Study,16
and most recently, a length of 5 min was proposed.23–25
This trend indicates the need to ﬁnd an “operational”deﬁnition of status epilepticus—eg, a time when the
patient should be treated as having status epilepticus,even if not all such patients are in established statusepilepticus.
Deﬁnition of status epilepticus
Early or impending status epilepticus 
The operational deﬁnition of status epilepticus is anempirical compromise dictated by therapeutic needs,because treatment should not be delayed until patients arein established status epilepticus, when neuronal injuryand time-dependent development of pharmacoresistancehave occurred. However, a better name would recognisethat treatment is needed even though not all patients arein established status epilepticus. We propose the term“impending status epilepticus”, deﬁned as continuous orintermittent seizures lasting more than 5 min, withoutfull recovery of consciousness between seizures. Previousauthors have used a similar concept—eg, “early heralds ofstatus”
14or “early status epilepticus”.26These deﬁnitions
recognise the need to treat those patients intravenouslywith high-dose anticonvulsants, because their risk ofdeveloping status epilepticus is high, but they alsoacknowledge that not all of those patients are in statusepilepticus. The Richmond study
27provides support for
this concept; more than 40% of the seizures lasting from10–29 min stopped spontaneously without treatment, andoverall mortality was 2·6% versus 19% for statusepilepticus lasting over 30 min (p /H110210·001). By adopting a
new category of impending status epilepticus, thesepatients will receive proper urgent medical care but willnot contaminate morbidity and mortality statistics,outcome measures, or clinical trials with a subpopulationthat is not in status epilepticus. Impending statusepilepticus is not a new concept,
14and ﬁts with Gastaut’s
deﬁnition of status epilepticus as an “enduring epilepticcondition”,
18a state which in his view required 30–60 min
of seizure activity.17
5 min of continuous seizures is the threshold deﬁning
impending status epilepticus, which corresponds withthe 5 min operational deﬁnition of status epilepticus.
23–25
There are strong statistical arguments for using the5 min criterion. The mean duration of generalisedLancet Neurol 2006; 5: 246–56

As in Clark and Prout’s classic work, we identify three phases of generalised convulsive status epilepticus, which we
call impending, established, and subtle. We review physiological and subcellular changes that might play a part inthe transition from single seizures to status epilepticus and in the development of time-dependentpharmacoresistance. We review the principles underlying the treatment of status epilepticus and suggest thatprehospital treatment is beneﬁcial, that therapeutic drugs should be used in rapid sequence according to a deﬁnedprotocol, and that refractory status epilepticus should be treated with general anaesthesia. We comment on ourpreference for drugs with a short elimination half-life and discuss some therapeutic choices.Status epilepticus: pathophysiology and management inadultsReview
http://neurology.thelancet.com Vol 5    March 2006 247convulsive seizures in adults ranges from 62·2 s to
52·9 s (SD 14) for the behavioural symptoms, andaverages 59·9 s (SD 12) for the electroencephalographicchanges.
28,29None of the seizures recorded lasted 2 min.
Therefore, impending status is a disorder in which theduration of seizures is 18–20 standard deviations awayfrom the norm of a single seizure, indicating thatsomething distinctly unusual and severe is happening.This deﬁnition matches the almost universal emergencyroom practice of treating those patients as if they hadstatus epilepticus. This change in terminology isunlikely to generate complacency or delay treatment,because the term impending implies that somethingsubstantial and, in this case, dangerous is about tohappen. 
Impending status epilepticus might be comparable to
the pharmacosensitive initiation phase of experimentalstatus epilepticus, and established status epilepticus toits partly pharmacoresistant maintenance phase.
30
However, no direct translation from animal data to careof patients is truly accurate, and clinical studies areneeded to validate this concept. 
Established status epilepticus 
The deﬁnition of status epilepticus should revert toclinical or electrographic seizures lasting more than30 min without full recovery of consciousness betweenseizures. We recognise that, in reality, impending andestablished status epilepticus are probably a continuum,but there is good support in experimental and clinicalstudies for a cut-off at 30 min; this is when statusepilepticus has become self sustaining in experimentalanimals,
15when status-epilepticus-induced damage is
distinct,20and when pharmacoresistance has
developed.16,31,32
By assuming that the transition from seizures to
status epilepticus can be modelled by a singleexponential curve, the time constant of thistransformation is deﬁned by the time point when 63%of patients have completed the transformation.According to the Richmond data,
27at 30 min about 60%
of prolonged seizures have transformed into anenduring epileptic condition. Animal data show that,after 30 min of perforant path stimulation, all animalswere in established status epilepticus.
15Additionally,
30 min of continuous seizures have been accepted as thedeﬁning duration of status epilepticus in both clinicalpractice and clinical trials. Those criteria only apply tomajor motor status epilepticus in adults and childrenover age 5 years. 
Subtle status epilepticus
This term was coined by Treiman33to draw attention to
the fact that, during prolonged status epilepticus, boththe motor and electroencephalographic expression ofseizures become less ﬂorid, yet the prognostic andtherapeutic implications of that stage are still those ofconvulsive status epilepticus. This stage is similar to
Clark and Prout’s idea of stuporous status epilepticus.
14
Partly treated status epilepticus 
In more than 10% of patients treated for statusepilepticus, clinical seizures stop or only show subtlesymptoms, but electrographic seizures continue.
34We
do not know whether this continuing seizure activity isharmful, but experimental evidence that uncontrolledﬁring alone can kill neurons
35suggests that treating
them is the prudent thing to do.
Epidemiology
Three important population-based prospective studieswere done to investigate the epidemiology of  statusepilepticus. The incidence of status epilepticus aroundRichmond (VA, USA) was 41 per 100 000 individualsper year;
36however, it was 27 per 100 000 per year for
young adults and 86 per 100 000 per year in the elderly.This askew distribution of incidence suggests that in anageing society, such as in the USA as the baby-boomgeneration ages, status epilepticus will become morefrequently encountered in emergency rooms.Alarmingly, mortality was also high in elderly people:14% for young adults (16–59 years) and 38% for elderlypeople (60 years and above).  These numbers show thatavailable treatments for status epilepticus are noteffective enough; identiﬁcation of optimum treatmentsis a substantial challenge for neurologists and scientists. 
Other studies show comparable incidence, if the
methods of data collection and variations of populationare considered. The incidence from two prospectivestudies in Europe was 17·1 per 100 000 per year inGermany
37and 10·3 per 100 000 per year in the French-
speaking part of Switzerland.38These ﬁndings are
similar to the incidence found in an early retrospectivestudy of status epilepticus from 1965–1984 in Rochester,Minnesota, which is 18·1 per 100 000.
39
Aetiology
The main causes of status epilepticus are low bloodconcentrations of antiepileptic drugs in patients withchronic epilepsy (34%), remote symptomatic causes(24%), cerebrovascular accidents (22%), anoxia orhypoxia (~10%), metabolic causes (~10%), and alcoholand drug withdrawal (~10%).
36
Several prognostic factors are important in
predicting outcome of status epilepticus: cause, age,seizure duration, and response to treatment. The highmortality groups are patients with anoxia or multiplemedical problems. Low mortality is reported inpatients with epilepsy and precipitating factors, such aslow serum concentrations of antiepileptic drugs.
36In
general, the elderly population bears a higher risk formortality and morbidity than any other age group.Prolonged status epilepticus and refractoriness totreatment are associated with poor outcome.

Self-sustaining status epilepticus
The tendency of status epilepticus to become self-
perpetuating and the fact that it is more than a series ofsevere seizures were recognised as early as the 19thcentury: in the words of Trousseau
11“in the status
epilepticus, something happens [in the brain] whichrequires an explanation”. In most models of statusepilepticus in awake, free-running animals, seizuresrapidly become self-sustaining and continue long afterthe withdrawal of the epileptogenic stimulus, whetherchemical
41–43or electrical.15,44,45Only when seizures are
induced under anaesthesia or in very immature brains46
do they remain stimulus bound. There is no proof thatseizures become self sustaining in human beings;however, the age-old observation that seizures that lastmore than a half hour become very hard to controlsupports that interpretation. Understanding themechanisms involved in the transformation from singleseizures to self-sustaining status epilepticus might helpus to prevent intractable status epilepticus and itsconsequences, brain damage, and epileptogenesis. After the serendipitous observation of status epilepticus
in animals subject to repeated electroconvulsiveseizures,
19models of self-sustaining status epilepticus
were developed by several investigators.41,47–52Lothman
and colleagues45showed that hippocampal stimulation
produced long-lasting limbic seizures, which causedbrain damage and later chronic epilepsy. Vicedomini andNadler
53showed that a series of ten after-discharges were
sufﬁcient to trigger self-sustaining status epilepticus.Mechanistic studies of self-sustaining status epilepticusand its consequences have used intermittent stimulationof the perforant path
15or of the amygdala.54,55
The initiation of self-sustaining status epilepticus
is easily blocked by many drugs that increase inhibitionor reduce excitation.
56However, once self-sustaining
status epilepticus is established, it is maintained byunderlying changes that do not depend on continuousseizures activity
57and it is easily stopped by only a few
drugs, all of which directly or indirectly inhibitglutamatergic neurotransmission.
57Barbiturates and
other GABAergic drugs never become totally ineffectivebut lose potency and can require such high doses thattoxic side-effects, such as cardiovascular depression,prevent the delivery of a fully effective treatment.
58
Another feature of self-sustaining status epilepticus is
the progressive, time-dependent development ofpharmacoresistance. Kapur and MacDonald
32showed
that the anticonvulsant potency of benzodiazepines candecrease by 20 times within 30 min of self-sustainingstatus epilepticus. Other anticonvulsants (eg, phenytoin)also lose potency, but more slowly.
31By contrast, NMDA
blockers remain highly efﬁcient in stopping thedisorder, even late in its course.
57
Pathophysiology of self-sustaining status epilepticus
Seizures produce many physiological and biochemicalchanges in the brain, but a mechanism, that is stillhighly speculative, has begun to emerge. The ﬁrstmilliseconds to seconds are dominated by theconsequences of protein phosphorylation. Ionicchannels open and close, neurotransmitters andmodulators are released, and receptor desensitisation,in its many forms, takes place. In a framework ofseconds to minutes, receptor trafﬁcking causes somekey adaptations. Long before any change in geneexpression can affect function, the existing receptorscan move from the synaptic membrane into endosomes,or be mobilised from storage sites to the synapticmembrane, and this process drastically changesexcitability by altering the number of inhibitory andexcitatory receptors available in the synaptic cleft(ﬁgure 1).
59In the minutes to hours time range, there
are plastic changes in neuropeptide modulators. Thesechanges are often maladaptive, with increasedexpression of proconvulsive neuropeptides
59,60and
depletion of inhibitory neuropeptides35,61–64contributing
to a state of raised excitability. Finally, in the hours,Control Tenth

Figure 1: Model of our hypothesis of receptor trafﬁcking in transition of single seizures to status epilepticus
Top: after repeated seizures, the synaptic membrane of GABAAreceptors forms clathrin-coated pits, which
internalise as clathrin-coated vesicles (C), inactivating the receptors because they are no longer within reach of theneurotransmitter. These vesicles develop into endosomes (E), which can deliver the receptors to lysosomes (L)where they are destroyed, or to the Golgi apparatus (G) from where they are recycled to the membrane. Bottom: bycontrast, in NMDA synapses, subunits are mobilised to the synaptic membrane and assemble into additionalreceptors. As a result of this trafﬁcking, the number of functional NMDA receptors per synapse increases whereasthe number of functional GABA
A receptors decreases.59Review
http://neurology.thelancet.com Vol 5    March 2006 249days, and weeks after seizures, there are long-term
changes in gene expression. Many changes in geneexpression are the result of seizure-induced neuronaldeath, and of the resulting neuronal reorganisation.Some are the result of plastic adaptation to seizureactivity, but because status epilepticus profoundlyinhibits brain protein synthesis,
65many of the acute
changes in gene expression are not consolidated.
Transition from isolated seizures to status epilepticus
In hippocampal slices from rats in lithium-pilocarpineinduced status epilepticus for 1 h, the number of GABA
A
receptors per dentate granule cell synapse is 18 (SD 4),compared with 36 (SD 11) per synapse in controls (ﬁgure1).
59Immunocytochemical or confocal microscopy
studies of the /H92532and /H92522–3subunits of the GABAA receptors
show a decrease in the number of subunits present onthe synaptic membrane and an increase in the interior ofthe cell.
59Endocytosis of the GABAAreceptors might
partly explain the failure of GABAAinhibition59,66and the
progressive pharmacoresistance to benzodiazepines asself-sustaining status epilepticus proceeds.
31,32Other
mechanisms might also play a part in this loss of GABA-mediated inhibition, including accumulation ofintracellular chloride
67,68or higher bicarbonate (HCO3/H11002)
permeability. Interestingly, extrasynaptic GABAA
receptors do not endocytose, raising the possibility thatstimulation of those extrasynaptic receptors might beuseful in the treatment of status epilepticus. At the sametime, AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits move to thesynaptic membrane where they form additionalexcitatory receptors (ﬁgure 1). This change furtherincreases excitability in the midst of uncontrolledseizures.
69Immunocytochemical studies show that the
NR1 subunits of NMDA receptors move fromsubsynaptic sites to the synaptic surface, andphysiological investigations show an increase infunctional NMDA receptors per dentate granule cellsynapse from 5·2(SD 1·2 ) receptors per synapse incontrols to 7·8 (SD 1·2) after 1 h of status epilepticus(ﬁgure 1). Not all receptor changes are maladaptive, andtrafﬁcking of tachykinin receptors, for example,decreases the amount of receptors, which would beexpected to maintain homoeostasis and decreasehyperexcitability.
70There are also maladaptive changes in
synaptic enzyme function. The autophosphorylation ofcalmodulin kinase II, for example, makes the enzymecalcium-independent, and this increases glutamaterelease presynaptically.
71
Maladaptive changes in neuropeptide expression in
self-sustaining status epilepticus
During self-sustaining status epilepticus, immun-
ocytochemical studies have suggested a depletion inhippocampus of the predominantly inhibitory peptidesdynorphin,
64galanin,63somatostatin,35,62and neuropeptide
Y,72whereas the expression of the proconvulsanttachykinins substance P and neurokinin B is increased,
in cells that do not normally express them at detectableconcentrations.
60These changes abate as self-sustaining
status epilepticus subsides, and might play a part inmaintaining self-sustaining seizures over many hours. 
Seizure-induced neuronal injury and death
We have known since the work of Meldrum andcolleagues
73,74that seizures, even in the absence of
convulsive activity, cause neuronal loss, and Sloviter35
showed that this cell death is the result of excessiveneuronal ﬁring, through excitotoxic mechanisms.Current models of self-sustaining status epilepticusinduce widespread neuronal death, which in adults ismostly necrotic
20and associated with mitochondrial
dysfunction,75,76although apoptotic death does happen
in several models and locations.77,78Evidence that
seizures induce neuronal injury in human beings islargely anecdotal: brain damage is often seen inpatients who die from status epilepticus;
79DeGiorgio
and colleagues80found decreased neuronal density in
the hippocampi of ﬁve patients who died after statusepilepticus compared with that in patients withepilepsy (without status epilepticus) and controls;Rabinowicz and colleagues
81and O’Regan and Brown82
identiﬁed increased neuron-speciﬁc enolase, a markerof neuronal death, in the serum of patients after statusepilepticus. Several imaging studies reported acutecerebral oedema and chronic atrophy after statusepilepticus
83–86although others did not.87Anecdotal
reports describe patients who had a normal brain MRIbefore status epilepticus, and showed atrophy by MRIafter status epilepticus and neuronal loss at autopsy.
88
Patients who developed status epilepticus from domoicacid poisoning showed neuronal loss at autopsy,
89and
focal atrophy has also been recorded in areas of intenseseizure activity
90–92supporting a causal link between
seizures and cell loss.
Status-epilepticus-induced epileptogenesis
Status-epilepticus-induced epileptogenesis is commonafter many types of status epilepticus in several animalspecies and at different ages.
93–96The association of this
event with the loss of GABAergic interneurons35,97or
with sprouting of excitatory ﬁbres98–100is still debated.
Evidence in human beings is remarkably sparse, andsubject to diverging interpretations. The risk ofunprovoked seizures is 3·34 times higher after acutesymptomatic status epilepticus (41%) then after singleseizures (13%),
101and the risk of developing a febrile
seizure is much higher after status epilepticus than aftersimple febrile convulsions
102but these differences might
reﬂect a more severe illness in patients with statusepilepticus, rather than status epilepticus-inducedepileptogenesis. Status epilepticus induced by domoicacid is epileptogenic and might offer the closest humanapproximation to the animal models.

The progressive development, during the course of
status epilepticus, of pharmacoresistance tobenzodiazepines and other anticonvulsants is welldocumented in animal models.
31,32In human status
epilepticus, early treatment is much more effective thanlate treatment,
16and pharmacoresistance is the most
likely of several possible explanations for these results.

Treatment of impending status epilepticus and
of status epilepticus
Therapeutic principles: time is brain
Although the optimum treatment of status epilepticus
needs to be further deﬁned by controlled clinical trials,several important principles have emerged. Earlyinitiation of intravenous anticonvulsants is crucial tosuccessful treatment of status epilepticus. Clinical datashow worsening of outcome with increasing duration ofstatus epilepticus;
40,111experimental data show time-
dependent loss of synaptic GABAAreceptors,59and as a
consequence, rapid loss of responsiveness tobenzodiazepines during status epilepticus.
31,32The
window of effective anticonvulsant therapy is narrow. Ifa treatment fails, there should be no interval between theend of a failed protocol and the initiation of the nexttherapy. The tight timetable outlined in the currenttreatment algorithms is difﬁcult to adhere to but shouldbe followed as closely as clinical circumstances allow.
The safeguarding of homoeostasis is essential for the
prevention of neuronal injury, and maximising thesupply of oxygen and glucose to the brain, bymaintaining cerebral blood ﬂow and blood gases, is asessential as reducing cerebral metabolic needs byrestricting seizures and hyperthermia. 
The diagnostic assessment is important but should not
delay treatment. A trained clinician should be able toestablish the diagnosis of impending or establishedstatus epilepticus on clinical grounds alone and begintreatment. In general, an electroencephalogram is notneeded before the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy.Even when electroencephalography is being done, itshould not delay treatment. The same is true of otherlaboratory studies.
Treatment varies enormously from hospital to
hospital,
112,113and most emergency rooms and intensive-
care units do not have a status epilepticus-protocol readyfor implementation, which might be one of the reasonswhy treatment is generally “too low, too slow”, withdelays initiating treatment,
40delays between drugs, and
timorous dosing possibly contributing to the pooroutcome.
114A treatment protocol helps avoid many of
these pitfalls and is highly recommended.112Prehospital treatment
Several studies have investigated the feasibility oftreatment before hospitalisation. Rectal diazepam issafe and effective in both adults and children in thepre-hospital care of patients with frequent seizures.Serum drug concentrations peak within 3–30 min, andstay therapeutic for at least 8 h.
114The drug terminated
seizures lasting for more than 5 min in eight patientsin a long-term care facility.
115One randomised, double-
blind, prospective study116showed that, in patients
with continuous seizures lasting longer than 5 min,seizures terminated before arrival to the emergencydepartment more commonly in those who were treatedwith intravenous lorazepam (59·1%) or diazepam(42·6%) than in patients treated with placebo (21·1%).These treatments were reasonably safe, with the ratesof respiratory or circulatory complications at10·3–10·6% versus 22·5% in the placebo group.Unfortunately, well-trained teams of paramedics didthese pilot studies, and intravenous treatment mightnot be as safe in other settings. For safety reasons, in aprehospital setting, where a physician is usually notpresent, we do not recommend use of diazepam andlorazepam at doses higher than those used in thestudy. Because the rectal route has not been widelyaccepted in adults, trials of prehospital treatment withdugs that can be given intramuscularly (eg,midazolam) and trials using the nasal or buccal routein adults are needed. Recent controlled clinical trials inchildren gave encouraging results.
116–118Whenever
feasible, however, giving either rectal diazepam orintravenous lorazepam or diazepam before arrival atemergency rooms is beneficial.
Medical management 
The ﬁrst goal of treatment, before giving anticonvulsants,is to maintain airway and blood pressure; this done,anticonvulsants should be given before doing a fulldiagnostic work-up. Careful diagnosis and managementof medical complications is essential throughout thecourse of status epilepticus.
10,119Hyperthermia,
tachycardia, systemic and pulmonary hypertension,pulmonary oedema, high-output failure, cardiacarrhythmias, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, hyperkalaemia,hyperglycaemia, blood and cerebrospinal ﬂuidleucocytosis are commonly noted.
10These parameters
should be closely monitored in an intensive-care unit.Control of hyperthermia is neuroprotective.
120,121
Continuous monitoring of vital signs, electrocardiogram,pulse oxymetry, and frequent checks of electrolytes, acid-base balance, and serum anticonvulsant concentrationsare useful. Substantial changes should be treatedappropriately. The presence of hypoxaemia andrespiratory acidosis is an indication for intubation inmost cases. Because cerebral blood ﬂow has becomepressure-dependent, cerebral metabolic needs remainhigh, and arterial blood pressure commonly falls late inReview
http://neurology.thelancet.com Vol 5    March 2006 251the course, systolic pressure should be maintained above
120 mm Hg if possible, and should not be allowed to fallbelow 90 mm Hg, even if this requires the use ofvasopressors. In a third of adults in status epilepticus,arterial pH falls below 7;
122the main contribution to this
change is lactic acidosis from skeletal muscle,19which
responds well to oxygen and control of convulsiveactivity. Our practice has been to treat with bicarbonate ifthe patient is hypotensive and arterial pH is /H110217 due to
metabolic acidosis. Massive release of insulin
123can rarely
lead to hypoglycaemia, which critically restricts glucosedelivery to the brain in infants
124and should be corrected.
More often, catecholamine release and other factorscause hyperglycaemia, which does not need correction inmost cases,
125and is not as harmful to the brain during
status epilepticus as in ischaemia, because circulationcan carry lactate out of the brain.
126,127Mild acidosis might
be an anticonvulsant128and neuroprotective.129
Treatment of seizures
Only three controlled, double-blind, clinical studies ofthe treatment of status epilepticus have been published.Leppik and colleagues
130compared lorazepam with
diazepam and found no difference. Treiman andcolleagues
16compared phenytoin, lorazepam, diazepam
and phenytoin, and phenobarbital, and there was nosigniﬁcant differences except that lorazepam wassuperior to phenytoin. Alldredge and colleagues
116
found both intravenous diazepam and lorazepamefﬁcacious in prehospital treatment. Because of thepaucity of type 1 evidence, many treatment protocols areused. Among 107 physicians surveyed in the SantaMonica meeting, 16 different protocols were used.
10A
British survey yielded similar results.112
Therapeutic principles for anticonvulsants 
The paucity of controlled studies condemns us to theold-fashioned use of pathophysiology andpharmacokinetics in many of our therapeutic decisions.Because one of the reasons for the poor results ofcurrent treatment
131,132is that anticonvulsant use tends
to be “too low, too slow”, we advocate the rapid,sequential use of anticonvulsants with a shortelimination half-life. In the Veterans AffairsCooperative Study,
16when the ﬁrst drug failed, 7·3 % of
patients responded to the second drug, and only 2% tothe third drug, but many patients might not havereceived a full dose of the third drug, and this couldhave been a factor in their failure. When usinganticonvulsants with a long elimination half-life (eg,diazepam, lorazepam, or phenobarbital), giving a fulldose of the third drug without dangerously depressingblood pressure may not be possible. With drugs thathave short half-lives, when treatment fails the drug israpidly eliminated and a full dose of the next drug canbe given without being limited by lingeringcardiovascular depression. One or two drugs? 
Type-1 evidence shows that lorazepam alone,phenobarbital alone, or phenytoin combined withdiazepam, are all effective, and therefore all threerepresent acceptable initial treatments of statusepilepticus.
16However, the VA Cooperative Study16
compared lorazepam 0·1 mg/kg, with phenytoin anddiazepam 0·15 mg/kg. Because lorazepam is severaltimes more potent than diazepam, the comparison wasbetween an adequate dose of lorazepam, and phenytoinplus an ineffective dose of diazepam, and the question ofwhether it is better to deliver two drugs simultaneouslyor sequentially remains unanswered. We initiatetreatment with two drugs that have differentmechanisms of action (ﬁgure 2), for two reasons. First,the time-dependent loss of potency of benzodiazepinesdocumented experimentally
31,32suggests that those drugs
should not be used alone when status epilepticus istreated more than 30 min after seizure onset, because30 min of seizures are sufﬁcient to cause a substantialdecrease in benzodiazepine potency.
32Hydantoins lose
potency more slowly than benzodiazepines,31and
starting them early should improve therapeutic results.Second, status epilepticus is a heterogeneous disorder,and attacking two mechanisms of action might increasechances of success. 
Comparison of  benzodiazepines
Type I evidence shows that both diazepam andlorazepam are effective in the treatment of statusepilepticus, whereas midazolam has never been used ina double-blind study.
130,133–135All three drugs achieve
effective brain concentrations quickly, althoughdiazepam is slightly faster than the others in this respect.Efﬁcacy and toxicity are similar, although anecdotalevidence slightly favours lorazepam. Pharmacokineticsfavour midazolam, which has an elimination half-life of90–150 min
136,137compared with 12–24 h for lorazepam
and 48 h for diazepam. The half-life of midazolam canincrease in subpopulations and during statusepilepticus, and its metabolism by the cytochrome P4503A4 enzymes might make it more susceptible to druginteractions than lorazepam, which is glucuronated. 
Comparison of  hydantoins 
Type I evidence shows that fosphenytoin causes few sideeffects (pain, phlebitis) at the injection site.
138The purple
glove syndrome is only reported anecdotally forphenytoin (type 4 evidence). This reduction of localtoxicity comes at a much higher cost. There is noevidence that either efﬁcacy or the incidence of cardiacarrhythmias differ between drugs, although fewerarrhythmias have been reported with fosphenytoin thanphenytoin. Rapid achievement of therapeutic brainconcentrations is desirable, whether the drugs differ inthis respect is unclear. The 10–15 min needed fordephosphorylation of fosphenytoin is compensated forReview
252 http://neurology.thelancet.com Vol 5    March 2006by the faster infusion rate of fosphenytoin (150 mg/min
vs50 mg/min, which for a 70 kg patient receiving
20 mg/kg, would gain 19 min). However, there is onesituation when fosphenytoin achieves therapeuticconcentrations faster than phenytoin. In patientsreceiving chronic phenytoin treatment (even ifconcentrations are slightly subtherapeutic), fosphenytoindisplaces phenytoin from its albumin binding sites,rapidly raising the free phenytoin concentration, which isthe key to the drug’s therapeutic action. 
Refractory status epilepticus
This term is deﬁned by the failure of adequate amountsof two intravenous drugs to stop seizures. Becausegeneralised convulsive status epilepticus is a life-threatening disorder with a very poor outcome if it doesnot respond to the ﬁrst two drugs,
16a moderate amount
of dose-dependent toxicity (eg, sleepiness, ataxia, andconfusion) is a small price to pay for stopping theseizures. Therefore, if the initial treatment does not stopthe seizures, the ﬁrst measure should be to add enoughanticonvulsant to reach a high therapeutic or low toxic
serum anticonvulsant concentration (eg, phenytoin30/H9262g/mL, or valproic acid of 150 /H9262g/mL). There should
be no hesitation to depress respiration and intubate, butsevere arterial hypotension should be avoided because itwill curtail cerebral blood ﬂow. If this additionaltreatment fails, another therapeutic drug should begiven, and possible causes should be carefully examinedto make sure that the cause of status epilepticus hasbeen treated.
Intravenous valproic acid has not been objectively
assessed for treatment of status epilepticus, butanecdotal reports suggest that it is effective andrelatively safe.
139–141Valproic acid is contraindicated in
patients under age 2years, and by severe liver disease,mitochondrial diseases, pancreatitis, pregnancy, andcaution should be used in young children. We currentlygive this drug before general anaesthesia, althoughother centres do not use it in refractory statusepilepticus because of the risk of delaying generalanaesthesia.

Figure 2: Management of status epilepticus
Impending or established status epilepticus: start with 20 mg/kg of fosphenytoin or phenytoin, and if status epilepticus persis ts, give an additional 10 mg/kg. Follow
the ﬂow chart UNLESS there is a history of drug intolerance (eg, allergy to phenytoin or benzodiazepine) then replace by intrav enous (IV) valproic acid 40–60 mg/kg
or IV phenobarbital 20 mg/kg; UNLESS treatment-induced hypotension slows rate of delivery; UNLESS history of progressive (PME) o r juvenile (JME) myoclonus
epilepsy (phenytoin/fosphenytoin harmful in PME, ineffective in JME), replace with IV valproic acid or IV phenobarbital; UNLESS  tonic status epilepticus with Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome (might be worsened by benzodiazepines), replace with IV valproic acid or IV phenobarbital; UNLESS, acute interm ittent porphyria, avoid P450
inducers, replace by NG gabapentin (if possible) or by IV valproic acid; UNLESS, focal status epilepticus without impairment of  consciousness, IV treatment not
indicated, load anticonvulsants orally or rectally. Refractory status epilepticus: IV valproic acid-start with 40 mg/kg and, if  status epilepticus persists, give an
additional 20 mg/kg. Continous intravenous infusion (CIV) usually starts with the lower dose, which is titrated to achieve seiz ure suppression and is increased as
tolerated if tachyphylaxis develops. Ketamine: rule out increased intracranial pressure before administration. Other drugs: fel bamate, topiramate, levetiracetam,
lidocaine, inhalation anaesthetics, etc. Dosage and pharmacokinetics of most anticonvulsants must be adjusted appropriately in patients with hepatic or renal failure,
or with drug interactions. Some patients in refractory status epiletpcius will need systemic and pulmonary artery catheterisati on, with ﬂuid and vasopressors as
indicated to maintain blood pressure. CBC=complete blood count; AED=antiepileptic drug; ABG=arterial blood gas.Review
http://neurology.thelancet.com Vol 5    March 2006 253fails, general anaesthesia should be given as soon as
possible.
General anaesthesia 
Once the patient has reached this stage, prognosis is poorregardless of treatment choice, and all options entailsigniﬁcant risks. Midazolam is an effective drug,
143–146but
we reserve it for patients who have not received adequatebenzodiazepine treatment. There is no objective evidencecomparing the risks of the propofol infusion syndrome
147
to the risks of the prolonged cardiovascular depressioncaused by barbiturates.
148–150Propofol151,152has a short half-
life, so that, if it fails, adequate amounts of another drugcan be tried. Barbiturate anaesthesia with eitherpentobarbital or thiopental
119,149,153(both have a relatively
short half-life) has been used extensively and withconsiderable success. Ketamine, is an attractive “agent oflast resort”, has proved useful in refractory statusepilepticus,
154is neuroprotective,155and is effective in
drug-resistant experimental status epilepticus.57,156
However, because ketamine can raise intracranialpressure, the absence of intracranial masses should beconﬁrmed (by CT scan, for example) before using it. Weconsider its NMDA antagonist properties as an asset,despite expressed concerns,
157but limited experience
restricts its use to refractory cases.
The stopping of seizures is the holy grail, but most
people accept a burst suppression pattern. Anaesthesiais usually stopped once a day, and if seizures recuranaesthesia is resumed for another 24 h.Electroencephalography is useful in determiningwhether seizures have completely stopped, as well as indiagnosing subtle status epilepticus in patients who donot regain consciousness after clinical seizures stop. 
Neuroprotection 
Most anticonvulsants that are active against partialseizures have some neuroprotective and antiepileptogenicproperties in animal models, but evidence from humanbeings is too scarce to recommend their use at present.Some of the more potent experimental drugs
43,158–161might
ﬁnd a place in the future treatment of status epilepticus.Conclusions
This review highlights the progress made inunderstanding the nature of status epilepticus in animalmodels and the paucity of reliable evidence in humanbeings. We propose a simpliﬁed nomenclature of statusepilepticus and an aggressive approach to its treatment.For established status epilepticus, available treatmentsfall far short of what an optimal drug should achieve.New therapies and controlled trials of available drugs areurgently needed.
