Abstract  
Clay is one of the interesting material s in the adsorption process for water 
treatment. According to  some reports, physical and chemical treatment s of clay 
are usually performed to increase the specific surface area as well as the 
adsorptivity for specified water contaminant s, and modeling related to 
optimization is usually used  for this purpose . Technically, optimization to obtain  
a high specific surface area by chemical experiment s is inefficient in time and 
chemical consumption, so a statistical approach may  be required. In this study , 
optimization of bentonite treatment  was conducted. Clay activation was 
conducted by acid treatment, calcination , and their combination s refer s to the 
application for chromate and rhodamine B adsorption. In such circumstances 
regarding  the variables of cl ay treatments, many studies have utilize d logit, 
probit , and co mpleme ntary log -log model s, but the se models are difficult to 
implement.  The a ims of the present  research  were  to evaluate  the Tobit model as 
a new method for predicting the specific surface area of clay as a function of the 
activation method ( reflux and calcination ) and the variables of acid concentration 
and the temperature of calcination.  The Tobit model produces  roughly the same 
results as the ordinary regression  model for  clay activation and adsorption 
application.  In order to identify  the maximum point, a central composite design 
provides a more accurate result with a maximum specific area of 167.34 m2/g at 
an activation temperature of 415.029 °C and an acid concentration of 0.4876  M.

 1.  Introduction  
The s pecific surface area (SSA) of clay minerals is an important parameter that is 
useful for predicting the capabilit ies of the mineral in adsorption and catalysis 
application s. Like many factors in adsorption and catalys is, the SSA parameter 
represents the adsorption capability , which is important to understand  specifically  
for further  technical applications  [1, 2]. The SSA quantifies the mineral surface 
area per unit mass and is expressed in meters squared per gram (m2 /g). The SSA  
varies widely depending on mineralogy and treatments, ranging from as much as 
approximately 800 m2/g for expansive clay minerals such as smectite, depending 
on the extent of the exposed inte rlayer surface, to as little as approximately 10 m2/g 
for non -expansive clay minerals such as kaolinite. Because the surface area s of silt, 
sand, and gravel -sized particles are negligible by comparison, the surface area s of 
natural soils containing a distr ibuted mixture of such particles are dominated by the 
SSA of the clay fraction, even if this fraction is very small. Such chemical and 
physical treatments are reported for determining the optimum surface area of clay 
minerals. Chemical treatment s that can be conducted are acid and base treatments , 
while physical treatment consist s of calcination (heating)  [3, 4]. The combination 
of both method s is also sometimes performed. In order to minimize step s or 
variation s in the optimiz ation  method, some research  has employed statistical 
analysis for optimization . One such analytical method  is regression analysis. By 
design ating the temperature of calcination (T) and the concentration of acid in the 
chemical treatment (C) as crucial parameters, the optimization of bot h parameters 
was conducted  in this study . 
Regression analysis assumes  a normal distribution of  the dependent variables 
with no limit value. In many cases, the only independent variable has a value with 
certain restrictions. For example,  the specific surface area has a minimum value of 
zero. In such cases, using multiple linear regression with ordinary least squares 
(OLS) is less precise because of the limited nature of the dependent variables. As 
OLS continues  to be used, the result will be a biased  and inconsistent estimator. 
Tobit regression can be used to overcome this problem  [5]. 
The Tobit regression  model  as a regression analysis method to determine  the 
dependent variable has limitations.  The e stimation of parameters in the Tobit model 
is done using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) . According to previous 
research, the MLE  method produces consistent and efficient estimators for large 
samples [6]. The Tobit regression model is used frequently to model censored 
variables in econometrics research. It has been  concluded that the simulation data of 
Tobit model parameter estimators tend to be biased upward, while OLS  results  tend 
to be biased downward. However, it can be guaranteed that the applicatio n of Tobit 
models with the maximum likelihood method will reduce the bias compared with the 
use of OLS in cases of  censored  data. Tobit estimates will provide a useful guide to 
failure s of homoskedasticity or normality  [7]. 
OLS is based on the assumption that data ha ve a normal distribution and lie in 
the - to  range . In many cases, data with limited values are also faced, either at 
the lower or upper limit. For example, the data on the temperature of a solution 
cannot be greater than 100 °C. A zero value is calculated as the lower censored 
value with 100 as the upper censored value , and the data is called censored data . 
This value  can be applied to assumption s of data distribution.  2326        J. Nug raha and I. Fatimah

 Monte  Carlo simulation stud ies were examined  to contrast the performance of 
the Tobit model for censored data to that of OLS regression. It was demonstrated  
that in the presence of a ceiling effect, if the conditional distribution of the measure 
of health status had uniform variance, then the coefficient estimates  from the Tobit 
model had superior performance compare d with estimates from OLS regression. 
However, if the conditional distribution had non -uniform variance, then the Tobit 
model performed at least as poorly as the OLS  model. The Tobit model has also 
been widely applied in research in the field of health  [8-10]. The present  research 
aims  to evaluate the effect of the statistical method for optimizing the specific 
surface area of clay as a function of activation methods ( reflux and calcination ) and 
the variables of temperature and acid concentration . With multiple factors 
influencing the specific surface area parameters, a design strategy for prediction 
and optimization are important economic -processing in an approach  similar to that 
of previous works [11-13]. In chemometric optimization, central composite design 
(CCD) is widely studied and compared with other techniques. Asghar et al . [11] 
reported the comparison of CCD and Taguchi optimization by the  Fenton  process 
and concluded that the Taguchi method i s a suitable alternative to CCD for several 
chemical engineering applications . In this research, the ordinary regression  model 
and the Tobit model  were evaluated for the prediction, and the optimum point was 
determined by comparing the models with CCD . Theoretically, the Tobit model 
can be utilized for this case because the data is censored data.  
Furthermore, all models were evaluated b ased on the coefficient of 
determination ( R2), the mean absolute error ( MAE), and the mean absolute 
percent age error (MAPE ). 
2. Tobit  Model  
The model was first developed by Tobin [14], who corre lated a study based on 
probit analysis and called it the Tobit model  (Tobit  Probit). C ensored data are 
normal ly distributed with the assumption N( ;2). The s tandard Tobit model 
formulation is an independent variable with a left-censored y-independent standar d 
of zero value : 
𝑦𝑖∗=𝑥𝑖,𝛽+𝜖𝑡 with  𝑦𝑖={0  𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑖∗≤0
𝑦𝑖∗ 𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑖∗>0                        (1) 
for i = 1,2,..., n stated the observation,  𝑦𝑖∗ is an unobserved var iable, xi is a vector 
of explanatory variables,  is a vector of unknown parameters, and i is a 
disturba nce term.  
In a g eneralization of the standard Tobit model, the dependent variable can be 
either left -censored, right -censored, or both left -censored and right -censored, 
where the lower and/or upper limit of the depend ent variable can be any number : 
𝑦𝑖∗=𝑥𝑖,𝛽+𝜖𝑡 with 𝑦𝑖={𝑎          𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑖∗≤𝑎
𝑦𝑖∗   𝑖𝑓 𝑎<𝑦𝑖∗<𝑏
𝑏        𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑖∗≥𝑏              (2) 
Here , a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit of the dependent variable  [15, 16]. Tobit Modeling  and Central Composite  Design for Optimization  . . . . 2327  
 
 
Journal of Engineering Science and Technology            August 2020, Vol. 15(4)  
 Tobit models are usually estimated using  maximum likelihood estimation 
(MLE) . Assuming that the disturbance term  follows a normal distribution with 
mean 0 and variance 2, the likelihood function , denoted L, is: 
𝐿=(∏ 𝑓(𝑦𝑖) 𝑦𝑖≤𝑎 )(∏ 𝑓(𝑦𝑖 𝑎<𝑦𝑖<𝑏 ))(∏ 𝑓(𝑦𝑖) 𝑦𝑖≥𝑏 )               (3) 
and f(yi) is the probability density function of normal distribution  
𝑓(𝑦𝑖)=1
√2𝜋𝜎2𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−1
2𝜎2(𝑦𝑖−𝑥𝑖′𝛽)2)  
So, the log likelihood function , denoted log L , is: 
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿 =(∑ 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑓(𝑦𝑖)) 𝑦𝑖≤𝑎 )+(∑ 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑓(𝑦𝑖)) 𝑎<𝑦𝑖<𝑏 )+(∑ 𝑙𝑜𝑔 (𝑓(𝑦𝑖)) 𝑦𝑖≥𝑏 ) (4) 
Eq. (4) can be stated as  
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿 =∑ 𝐼𝑖𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛
𝑖=1  (𝑎−𝑥𝑖′𝛽
𝜎)+∑ 𝐼𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑛
𝑖=1  (𝑥𝑖′𝛽−𝑏
𝜎)  + ∑ ((1−𝐼𝑖𝑎−𝑛
𝑖=1
               𝐼𝑖𝑏)𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑦𝑖−𝑥𝑖′𝛽
𝜎)−𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝜎) )               (5) 
with 𝐼𝑖𝑎={1 𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑖=𝑎
0  𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑖>0 and 𝐼𝑖𝑏={1  𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑖=𝑏
0   𝑖𝑓 𝑦𝑖<0 and (𝑧)=∫1
𝜎𝑓(𝑦𝑖)𝑑𝑦𝑖𝑍
−∞. 
The maximum likelihood estimations  for  and  are the optimization of Eq. 
(5). Those equations can be solved by using the maxLik function of the maxLik 
package  in R software  [17]. Tobit models can be estimated in R  software  with the 
censReg  function , which is available in the censReg  package  [15, 16]. 
3.  Optimization in Linear Model  
The b asic concept of optimization in a linear model is that the function of two 
variables, z=f(x,y) has contin uous second partial derivatives in ( x=a, y=b) and  
𝜕𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)
𝜕𝑥|
(𝑥=𝑎,𝑦=𝑏)=𝜕𝑓(𝑥,𝑦)

(𝑥=𝑎,𝑦=𝑏). 
with the p roperties of f(x,y)  as below:  
a. f(a,b)  is a local minimum value if A > 0 and  > 0. 
b. f(a,b)  is a local maximum value if A < 0 and  > 0. 
c. if < 0; then f(a,b) is not an extreme value.  
d. If  = 0, there is no conclusion . 
In order to evaluate  whether there are any effect s of x and y for z, linear model s 
of two -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis were conducted.  
4.  Materials  and Method  
The m aterial s used for the experiments were natural montmorillonite / bentonite  
from East Java, Indonesia ; sulfuric acid (Merck -Millipore, Germany) ; and N 2 gas 
(Samator , Indonesia). Montmorillonite activation was conducted by refluxing 2328        J. Nug raha and I. Fatimah  
 
 
Journal of Engineering Science and Technology            August 2020, Vol. 15(4)  
 montmorillonite powder in varied concentration s of sulfuric acid ( C) for 4 h , 
neutralization using water followed by drying and calcination at varied 
temperature s (T). The sulfuric acid concentration s were 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 M and 
the temperature of calcination ranged  from 25 °C to 700 °C. The specific surface 
areas ( SSA) of the activated montmorillonite samples were determined based on  
the Brunauer -Emmet t-Teller (BET) equation from the N 2 adsorption -desorption 
data obtained using a NOVA 1200e gas sorption analyzer (Quantachrome, New 
York, US).  
The m aximum value was determined from the most accurate of three models: 
linear, Tobit, and composite  design.  
5.  Results and Discussion  
Figure 1  presents the result s of the SSA at various temperature s and concentration s 
of acid.  
In each treatment , it can be seen that the effect of T on the SSA achieves the 
maximum at T=400 °C, except for C=0, where the maximum SSA is at T=500 °C. 
 
Fig. 1. Surface area at varied temperature s and concentration s of acid . 
Furthermore , the specific surface area  at each temperature affects  the optimum 
concentration. At room  temperature  (25oC), each SSA is achieved at C=2 and T= 
200 and moves to C=1. At T=400, the optimum values were achieved at C=0.5 and 
T=500 ; the  optimum wa s obtained at C=0, so the opposite effect identif ies the 
interaction. In general , the optimum point s are at C=0.5 and T=400.

Analysis  of the effect of C and T using 2 -way ANOVA provides the output 
presented in Table 1.

It is clearly found from the F statistic that C and T have a significant effect on SSA. 
Points to be noted are:  
a. There is an influence of C on SSA (Z). 
The highest Z value occurred at C=1, which is 135.55 , and the lowest value was 
at C=0, corresponding to 117.4662. At C=2, the Z value was 128.13 , which 
indicates  that the concentration of acid ( C) exerts influence in a quadratic pattern . 
b. There is an influence of T on SSA (Z). 
The description of the effect of T on Z can be seen in Fig. 1. The lowest mean 
of Z occurs at room temperature, with the value of 97.89 , while the maximum 
value , at T=400 , is 150.13 . The Z value is reduced  at increasing temperature s of 
more than 400 °C. 
c. There is an interaction b etween C and T on SSA (Z). 
The i nteraction between C and T is described by the curve in Fig . 1. The 
minimum Z is 68.05 through the combination of T at room temperature and the 
concentration of acid ( C) at zero ( C= 0). The maximum value for Z is 167.43 , 
which results  from the combination of T= 0.5 and C= 400.  
By using the linear regression  model , it was noted that the linear model of the 
second -order was obtained. The regression equation is : 
Z = 65.4  + 47.3 C + 0.257 T - 0.0427 CT - 12.6 C2 - 0.000243 T2            (7)

Values in the parentheses are the student ’s t-test values of the corresponding 
parameter , which  leads to the conclusion that the model obeys the second -degree 
polynomial with the value of coefficient determination  R2 = 75.31%. 
The o ptimiza tion of Eq. (7) can be conducted using the propertie s of Eq. (6). 
The f irst order -derivati ve of the equation is :

By using d Z/dC= 0 and d Z/dT = 0, it is found that:  
T0 = 428.581  and C0 = 1.151

 Based on Eq. (6), it is found that  = 1.0760. Because 𝜕2𝑍
𝜕𝐶2<0 and  > 0 it is 
concluded that f(T0, C0) is the maximum  at f. The m aximum value of the specific 
surface area as determined using the OLS  method  is 
Zmax = 147.5967  
It is concluded that the maximum value obtained from OLS is lower than the  
maximum value obtained from observation.  
On T =28 and C= 0, the SSA is found to be 68.05, meanwhile the optimum 
condition is on T0 = 428.581 and C0 = 1.15 1. Zmax = 147.597. The data suggest that 
there is an increasing SSA of 216.89%.  The result is refer to previous research on 
the increasing specific surface area of silica alumina material at higher temperature 
and acid concentration in activation process  [4] .The higher concentration of 
activation agent has a direct correlation to produce porous structure and active  sites 
and cavities in the silica -alumina material  [1]. Particularly in this research, effect 
of acid concentration on SSA is by polynomial second order at the maximum 
concentration of C= 1.15 1.  
5.2.  Tobit model  
The Tobit model provides the capability  to ensure the left o r right censor points. 
From those  points, it is found that the left censor type of 90 is the sufficient point . 
The determination of the c ensor ed value of the lower limit is due to aim of the 
study , which was to incr ease the SSA with varied temperature s and acid 
conc entration s. The fit equation is : 
Z = 64.278 + 46.581 C + 0.262T - 0.0432CT - 0.000 248T2 - 12.159C2                 (10)

Values in the parentheses are the student ’s t-test values o f the corresponding 
parameter.  Based on the student’s t -test value, it is concluded that all parameters in 
Eq. (10) are significant. The model has  a log-likelihood  value  of -291.2797  at a 
degree of freedom (Df) of 7. It was n oted that G2 = -2 log-likelihood  has Chi-square 
distribution, so the obtained value  was G2 = 582.5594 , which  has a value of p-value  
= 1.386.10-121. These statistics provide evidence that the model fit with the data. 
The correlation between observation and prediction on the Tobit model is 75. 23%. 
The optimization of Eq. (1)  can be performed using the properties of Eq. (6) . 
The f irst order derivati ve of the equation is :

As with the result  from OLS, the maximum value obtained from the Tobit 
model is lower than the maximum value obtained from observation.  
5.3.  Central composite design (CCD)  
CCD  is one of the more respons ive surface methodolog ies, and it has been widely 
used for optimization in catalysis and chemical process es, such as seeking the 
optimum catalytic condition, preparation of catalyst extraction of specific 
component s, etc. [13, 18, 19].  
An e xperiment  was conducted  using CCD  with a center of T= 400 and C= 0.5 .

The values in the parentheses are the student’s t-test values of the corresponding 
parameter . The ANOVA  and test mod el statistics , which  are presented in T able 3, 
show that the model is very good. This can be seen from  the F value , the value of 
Lack of Fit , and the R2 value.  2332        J. Nug raha and I. Fatimah

 a. The F value in regression  showed that not all of the regression  coefficients 
were equal to zero. The conclusion to be noted is that all variables in Eq. (14) 
influence the Z values  significantly . 
b. From  the value of Lack of Fit , p-value  > α. P-value  is larger than α, there is 
no evidence that the model does not fit the data. We can conclude that the 
model fit the data well.  
c. R-squared  (R2) is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted 
regression  line. It means that the m odel is capable of  describ ing the variation 
among the data at 83.5%. Using the central comp osite design can result in 
very low variance inflation factor  (VIF) values (close to 1), which means 
that multicollinearity  does not occur. In other words, the model has the 
predictive capability.

be seen that the observation value s lie around the line, indicating the correlation of 
observation and prediction values with a correlation of 0.918 3.

At T=28 and C= 0, the SSA is 68.05 , while the optimum conditions are  C0 = 
0.48761  and T0 = 415.0298 , Zmax = 167.3359.  An increase of 245.90% was obtained . 
6.  Comparison Tobit, OLS in two-way ANOVA , and Central  
Composit e Design  
A comparison of the model can be derived from:  
1) Correlation of observed and predicted values  
The correlation between observed and predicted value s is given in Table 4 and 
the scatter plot s in Figs. 1 and 2. 
Table 4. Correlation between observation and prediction . 
Model  R2 (%) MAE  MAPE  (%) 
OLS  75.308  7.663  6.050  
Tobit 75.230  9.408  7.865  
Composit e Design  83.513  4.048  3.076  
Based on the coefficient determination v alue denoted R2 in Table 4, the OLS 
and Tobit models are relatively similar. However, the regression model obtained 
using CCD  resulted in a better R2 value than the factor design in Table 1. It is noted 
that the obtained linear model from CCD  as Eq. (14) is applied for  258.6   T  541 
and 0.5 C 1.207. Otherwise, the insignificant fitness will be obtained at range s 
of 28 T 700 and 0C2 with R2 of 7.17%  and a MAPE value of 38.363% . Linear 
model Eq. (7)  and Tobit model Eq. ( 10) can be utilized for predicting SSA at varied 
C and T. Meanwhile Eq. (14) from CCD can be  employed for det ermining optimum 
value, but cannot  be used for predicting SSA  [11, 12, 13, 19] .

 From both the MAE and MAPE values, it can be seen that OLS is better than 
the Tobit model. In advance, the Tobit  model has advantages as there is no censored 
observation, the results will be the same as OLS  and the determination of censored 
point s can be obtained from visual graphical analy sis. 
2) Maximum values from the points  
The optimum  value uses OLS and the Tobit model based on factor design , as in 
Eqs. (7) and (10) , compared with the optimization value in CCD . 
Based on the maximum  value in Table 5, the regression model obtained using  
CCD  gives the value closest to the observed value , as in the two-way ANOVA .  
Table 5. Comparison of optimization  on 2-way design and CCD . 
Model  T(oC) C(M)  Lmax(m2/g) 
2-way ANOVA  400 0.50 167.43  
OLS  428.58 1.15 147.59 
Tobit 427.5 2 1.16 147.21 
Composit e Design  415.0 3 0.49 167.3 4 
From the statistics F, R2, MAE and MAPE  it is concluded that CCD is the best 
among OLS and the Tobit  model . The optimum value obtained using CCD is 
T=415.029  °C, C=0.4876 , for a SSA of 167.34 . 
The comparison on statistical optimization for specific surface area of clay and 
other adsorbent  materials are listed in Table 6 .

Bentonite  Response surface 
methodology  
(RSM) , (time, acid

microwave heating 
power in  
microwave -assisted 
activation method)  RSM represents good method 
for optimization with R2= 0.914. 
The optimum conditions to 
obtain the maximum specific 
surface area for microwave  
assisted acid -activated bentonite 
were acid concentration = 5.2 
M, time = 7.4  min, and 
microwave power = 117 W.  [20] 
Hydroxyapatite  CCD  CCD is effectively optimizing  
the activation for increasing 
specific surface area of 
Hydroxyapatite  prepared from 
catfish. The  optimum 
conditions for the production n 
were found to be calcination 
temperature of 300 °C and 
calcination tim e of 1 h . [21] Tobit Modeling  and Central Composite  Design for Optimization  . . . . 2335

 Bentonite  Response  surface 
methodology based 
on central composite 
rotatable design 
(CCRD)  The small p-value  (0.0001) and 
a suitable coefficient of 
determination ( R2=0.9270) 
showed that the quadratic 
polynomial model based on 
optimization is good fit with 
the experimental data. The 
optimal conditions for the acid  
activation of the bentonite were 
obtained at 90 °C, 4.5 N, 450 
rpm,1:4.5 and time 3 h.  [22] 
Smectite  clay Factorial design  The statistical method showed 
good optimization for specific 
surface area based on the 
variables of temperature, acid 
(HCl) concentration, stirring 
speed, solid/liquid ratio, and 
time. The coefficient of 
determination  of 0.995  
indicates a good predictability 
of the model.  [23] 
Bentonite  CCD  A central composite design was 
used to determine the 
pertinence of variables: the 
activation temperature ( X1), 
activation time ( X2) and massic 
ratio for adsorptivity for Cd(II). 
Coefficient of determination = 
0.92.  [24] 
Bentonite  OLS, Tobit model, 
and CCD  CCD is the best model for 
optimizing specific surface area 
with the condition at 
temperature (T) of 415.029 °C 
and a sulfuric acid concentration 
(C) of 0.488 M, with the 
optimum value of 167.34 m2/g. 
coefficient of determination  
between prediction and 
observation = 0.918 . This work  
Refer to the data in Table 6, it can be noted that the CCD method applied in this 
research is comparable  with previous works as shown by the similar  coefficient of 
determination  between  prediction and observation at around 0.92, even though there 
is the better model with higher correlation value (0.995) obtained by factorial design.  
The better performance is due to the more variables as predictors for the optimization. 
The results imply t hat CCD has good capability for optimization on less data.  
7. Conclusion s 
OLS, the Tobi t model,  and CCD can be applied to optimize the specific surface  
area of clay  by the activation method. In this study , OLS and the Tobit model 2336        J. Nug raha and I. Fatimah  
 
 
Journal of Engineering Science and Technology            August 2020, Vol. 15(4)  
 showed  similar performance to CCD , but CCD show ed the best  performance . The 
optimum value s for maximizing the  SSA by clay activation are a temperature ( T) 
of 415.029  °C and a sulfuric acid concentration ( C) of 0.488 M , with the optimum 
value of 167.3 4 m2/g. 
Central composite design can be used for modeling the optimum condition s for 
clay activation with temperature and acid concentration vari ables. Central 
composite design will show the most accurate optimum condition as it can be 
applied to a range of optimum condition s with better fitness than OLS regression .
