ABSTRACT  
Complete decolorization of Reactive dyes i.e. Reactive yellow 15, Reactive yellow 145 and 
Reactive red 195 has been observed at concentration of 500 mg/l within minimum time of 4 -18 hrs 
in static condition of growth by three different bacterial isolates na mely, Fictibacillus gelatini , 
Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum  and Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis  isolated from soil and dry 
sludge, near textile dyeing industry. These selected isolates showed even higher decolorization in 
simple nutrient broth med ia than in optimized media having combination of maltose and yeast 
extract at 37°C and neutral pH. Either they showed similar results as obtained in nutrient broth or 
showed less decolorization with supplementation. This suggests that carbon and nitrogen s ources 
acted as a catabolite repessor. Current study is environmental -friendly due to use of biological 
methods and without any hazardous end products, highly economical as microbes utilized dyes as 
carbon and nitrogen source for their effective growth apa rt from complete decolorization that is 
occurring very fast within hours.

INTRODUCTION  
A large number of small textile processing units are scattered all over  India. It is one of the most 
complicated among manufacturing industries that discharge large quantities of contaminants in 
wastewater, with organic pollutants (pesticides, herbicides, phenols, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs), aliphatic and heteroc yclic compounds) [1]. Azo dyes are characterized by 
the presence of one or more azo groups ( -N=N -), which are responsible for their coloration and 
when such bond is broken or degraded, the color is lost [2]. Out of all chromogenic dyes, the 
reactive groups  of azo dyes are predominantly used due to superior fastness for the fabric, high 
photolytic stability and resistance towards microbial degradation [3]. Dyes are most difficult to 
treat because of their complex & synthetic origin. Due to this, total degrad ation of azo dyes is the 
only solution for the elimination of intermediate xenobiotic compounds from the environment 
because alternations in the chemical structures result in formation of new xenobiotic compounds 
which may be more or less toxic than parent al. The existing physico -chemical methods were found 
to be less effective, since they exhibit operational complexity, are expensive and unable to 
completely remove azo dyes & their metabolites and also generate large amount of secondary 
pollutants [4].  
This poses a challenge to researchers in finding alternative biological methods that are efficient, 
inexpensive, eco -friendly and produce less amount of sludge [5], [6]. In most of the studies, 
decolorization is occurring in many days with very low rate of d ecolorization or the 
microorganisms are capable of degrading at a very low concentration of dyes. Many workers have 
reported that  rate of dye decolorization gradually decreases with increasing concentration of dyes  ISSN: 2320-0294Impact Factor: 6.765

 due to the toxic effect of dyes on degrad ing microorganisms or the blockage of active sites of 
enzymes by dye molecule with different structures [7]. Decolorization percentage of RY145 by B. 
boroniphilus  was inversely proportional to the dye concentration. Therefore at conc. of 500 mg/l of 
dye th ere was nearly 0% decolorization in 24 h [8]. The maximum decolorization of 86.2% of 
Reactive Red HE8b by DN1 was observed at 200 mg/l of dye concentration [3]. This is not the case 
with our strains. The present investigation with Fictibacillus gelatini,  Bacillus subtilis subsp. 
inaquosorum and Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis is quite significant as it reports decolorization of 
very large (500 mg/l) concentration of different Reactive dyes (Figure 1) in a very short time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Chemicals and Dye collection : All the chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Hi -
Media Laboratories and Textile dye Reactive Yellow15 (λ max=420nm), Reactive Yellow 145(λ 
max=418nm) and Reactive Red 195(λ max=542nm) were collected from Bhiwani Textile Mill, 
Haryana, India.  
Isolation,  Screening and Identification of Bacteria  
Different sludge samples were collected from Nahar Textile Industry, Lalru (Punjab) and the 
isolation of bacterial colonies was done by serial dilution method.  The pure colonies were obtained 
by spreading & streak ing techniques and incubating at 37°C for 24 h. A preliminary identification 
of the cultures was based upon biochemical tests. The culture was sent for 16 S r -DNA sequencing 
at MTCC IMTECH, Chandigarh for confirmation of species level identification.  
Strai n, Media and Culture Condition  
Modified Zhou and Zimmermann (ZZ) agar medium (Y.E -5 g/l, glucose -5 g/l, (NH 4)2SO 4- 0.5 g/l, 
KH 2PO 4- 2.66 g/l, Na 2HPO 4- 4.32 g/l) was used to study the effect of different parameters on 
decolorization of Reactive yellow 15, Reactive yellow 145 & Reactive red 195. Decolorization 
experiments were carried out in nutrient broth (Peptone -3 g/l, Yeast extract -5 g/l, NaCl -3 g/l).  
 Decolorization of Dyes  
 An inoculum size of 10% of pre -cultured cells was inoculated in modified ZZ med ium containing 
Reactive dyes. Experiments were performed in triplicates and control (without microorganisms) 
was included.  
Decolorization activity was expressed in terms of percentage decolorization and was determined by 
monitoring the decrease in absorban ce at absorption maxima of Reactive dyes. The uninoculated 
medium supplemented with respective dye was used as reference. The culture suspension was 
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min for removal of the biomass as they interfere with the 
measurement. The  degree of decolorization of dyes was measured by reading the absorbance of 
supernatants at λ max of specific dyes by UV -visible spectrophotometer. The decolorization was 
calculated according to the following formula:  
Decolorization (%) =   Ao−A
AoA ×100 
Where, Ao is the initial dye absorbance before decolorization and A is the absorbance after 
decolorization [9], [10].  
 
Optimization of pH, Temperature, Inoculum size, and Concentration of dyes  
Decolorization was studied by varying different parameters such as pH (6,7,8,9 and 10), 
Temperature (25,30,37,40,45 and 50 °C), Inoculum size (1,3,5,7.5 and 10%) along with dye

 concentrations (100, 200, 500, 1000 mg/l of the Reactive dyes). The Percentage decolorization was 
measured at different time intervals & determ ined by decolorization equation given above.  
Enzyme screening assays: Quantitative assay  
Quantitative results are reported numerically and compared against accompanying reference 
interval for interpretation. Laccase, Azo -reductase, Tyrosinase and Lignin pe roxidase (LiP) 
activities were analyzed in cell free extracts as well as in culture supernatants.  
Laccase assay (EC. 1.10.3.2) was performed by a modified protocol from Zarvazina et al. (2004) 
[11], which used 2, 2’ -azino -bis-(3-ethylthiazoline -6-sulfonat e) (ABTS) as a substrate at pH 6.0. 
The reaction was started by adding 1 ml of sample and was monitored spectrophotometrically at 
436 nm . One unit of activity was regarded as the amount of enzyme capable of converting 1µM 
ABTS per min per ml. Laccase activ ity was also determined by using protocol from Bain et al., 
(2003) [12], which used Guaicol as substrate at pH 6.5 and was monitored spectrophotometrically 
at 465 nm . One unit was the amount of enzyme that increases absorbance by 0.001 units at 37°C. 
Azore ductase (EC. 1.7.1.6) was determined by protocol from Chen et al., (2005) [13], with 4.45 M 
of dyes, 100 µM NADH in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 1ml of enzyme solution and 
monitored for the decrease in color absorbance (430 nm) at room temperature. Azo reductase 
activity  was expressed in terms of azo dye reduction which was calculated by using molar 
absorption coefficient of 23M-1cm-1 at 430 nm.  Tyrosinase was determined by reaction mixture of 
2 ml, containing 0.01% catechol in 0.1M phosphate buffer  (pH 7.4) at 475 nm (Zhang et al., 1997) 
[14]. Lignin peroxidase activity  was determined by monitoring the formation of propanaldehyde 
at 300 nm in a reaction mixture of 2.5 ml containing 100 mM n -propanol, 250 mm tartaric acid, 
and 10mM H 2O2 (Shanmugan et al., 1999) [15].  All enzyme assays were run in triplicates and 
average results were calculated and one unit of enzyme activity was defined as the change in 
absorbance unit/min/ mg of enzyme, where blank test tube contained all components except the 
enzyme  solution. Protein estimation was carried out by Lowry et al. (1951) [16].  
RESULTS  
Isolation, Screening and Identification of Microorganisms  
Pure bacterial colonies obtained were tested for their decolorization ability in nutrient broth 
medium supplemente d with 500 mg/l of each textile dyes separately (Reactive yellow 15, Reactive 
yellow 145 and Reactive red 195). Three isolates were found to be capable of complete 
decolorization of these dyes in very less time and therefore chosen for further studies. Sel ected 
bacterial strains were identified by 16 S rRNA as Fictibacillus gelatini , Bacillus subtilis 
inaquosorum  and Bacillus subtilis subtilis .  
Optimization studies for maximum dye decolorization  
The identified bacterial cultures were taken for decolorization assays with Reactive yellow 15, 
Reactive yellow 145 and Reactive red 195 dyes in simple nutrient broth and evaluated for percent 
decolorization at time interval of 2 hrs for 2 days and thereaf ter 24 hrs for rest of the days (8 days) 
at their optimum conditions of pH 7 and 37°C of static growth. Initial screening of cultures was 
found to be efficient to decolorize all the three dyes completely in 4 to 18 hrs. During first few 
hours the rate of d ecolorization of RY15, RY145, and RR195 by Fictibacillus gelatini , Bacillus 
subtilis inaquosorum & Bacillus subtilis subtilis was fast. Decolorization rate increased 
consistently from 4 to 12 hrs and finally complete decolorization was observed in case of the three 
dyes (Figure 2).   ISSN: 2320-0294Impact Factor: 6.765

Figure 2: D ecolorization of reactive dyes in simple nutrient broth medium by Fictibacillus gelatini , 
Bacillus subtilis inaquosorum and  Bacillus subtilis subtilis . 
All the three isolates were grown and optimized in modified ZZ  medium (containing C and N 
sources) at same conditions as mentioned above. Different carbon sources (glucose, galactose, 
fructose, mannitol, maltose, sucrose & starch) and nitrogen sources (peptone, yeast extract, beef 
extract, malt extract, sodium nitrat e & ammonium nitrate) were supplemented to all the three 
isolates. Out of these, medium with combination of Maltose and Yeast extract showed good results 
but decolorization was not as high as in case of nutrient broth (Table 1 & Figure 3). Either they 
show ed similar results as obtained in nutrient broth or showed less decolorization with 
supplementation. This suggests that carbon and nitrogen sources acted as catabolite repessor as 
their presence did not show any good results as observed in simple nutrient broth and decreased 
their decolorization in modified medium. At a dye conc. of 500 mg/l and in absence of yeast extract 
the decolorization was found to be 81.94%, after 70 hrs suggesting that the organism could utilize 
organic dye as sole C source [17].

Figure 3: Decolorization of reactive dyes with co -substrate by Fictibacillus gelatini, Bacillus 
subtilis inaquosorum and Bacillus subtilis subtilis . 
Effect of pH & Temperature on Reactive dyes decolorization  
pH of the medium greatly affect the percentage of decolorization. All the three isolates showed 
optimum results at pH 7 and the pH range of our culture was reported to be between 6 -10. 
Temperature is the key factor, which affect the cells and its metaboli c reactions during breakdown 
or utilization of complex carbon compounds in form of reactive dyes. The effect of temperature 
ranging from 25 - 50°C was investigated and checked the percentage of decolorization. At higher 
temperature decolorization slowly dec reased and efficient decolorization was reported at 37°C. 
This may be due to greater synthesis of enzymes and the decolorization at optimal temperature may 
be owing to higher respiration and substrate metabolism.  
Effect of inoculum size on Reactive dyes d ecolorization  
Inoculum size plays an important role because of sufficient biomass required to decolorize and 
degrade the substrate in form of dye to product. The effect of inoculum size on dye decolorization 
was studied with the addition of different inocu lum sizes from 1 to 10% and observed the 
percentage of decolorization. Optimum inoculum size for complete decolorization of dyes was 
observed to be 10% (v/v).  
Effect of dye concentration on Reactive dyes decolorization  
The Reactive dye molecule is a compl ete structure. So, the concentration of dye strongly influences 
the decolorization ability of the organism. Complete decolorization of all three reactive dyes in 
different conc. ranges as 100, 200, 500 & 1000 mg/l were observed in very less time period by all 
the three isolates. Isolate Fictibacillus gelatini  completely decolorized all three initial conc. of 
RY15 dye in 12h, RY145 dye was completely decolorized; 100 mg/l in 36h, 200 mg/l in 2days & 
500 mg/l decolorized to 33% in 8days and RR195 dye was comp letely decolorized; 100 mg/l in 
12h, 200 mg/l in 18h & 500 mg/l decolorized to 50% in 8 days and the isolate showed no 
decolorization of all three dyes at conc. of 1000 mg/l.  
 Isolate Bacillus subtilis inaquosorum  showed complete decolorization of RY15; 10 0 mg/l in 12h, 
200 mg/l in 18h, 500 mg/l also in 18h & no decolorization at conc. of 1000 mg/l, initial conc. of 
RY145 dye was completely decolorized in 12h but at conc. of 1000 mg/l upto 86.4% decolorization 
was observed in 2 days. In case of dye RR195 al l three conc. upto 500mg/l were completely 
decolorized in 18h but 1000 mg/l conc. was decolorized upto 80.1% in 3 days.  
Similarly Bacillus subtilis subtilis  showed complete decolorization of 100, 200 and 500 mg/l of 
RY15 in 12h, 18h, 18h respectively and no decolorization was observed at 1000 mg/l of the dye, 
RY145 dye at conc. 100 mg/l was decolorized in 12h, 200 mg/l also in 12h but 500 mg/l was 
decolorized upto 98.6% in 1day & 1000 mg/l upto 66.8% in 3 days. All three initial conc. of dye 
RR195 were com pletely decolorized in 12h but at conc. of 1000 mg/l upto 67.3% decolorization 
was achieved in 3 days. So, decolorization percent is constantly or progressively increased with dye 
conc. upto 500 mg/l of dye after which decolorization percent started to dec rease (Table 2).

Enzyme analysis  
Cell free intracellular content of the organism has shown the presence of laccase, lignin peroxidase, 
azoreductase and tyrosinase. The results of different enzyme activity assessed are shown in Table 
3. Presence of these enzymes in the extracellular conten t of cells indicates the harmless fate of 
primary aromatic amines produced after reductive cleavage of azo bond in dyes.  
Fictibacillus gelatini  & Bacillus subtilis inaquosorum  showed higher Laccase & Azoreductase 
activity, as compared to other enzymes & Bacillus subtilis subtilis  possessed higher activity of 
enzyme azoreductase at pH 7 and 37°C.

Effect of Carbon and Nitrogen sources  
Carbon and nitrogen sources seemed to be effective to promote the decolorization of textile dyes. 
In the present study different c arbon sources (glucose, galactose, fructose, mannitol, maltose, 
sucrose & starch) and nitrogen sources (peptone, yeast extract, beef extract, malt extract, sodium 
nitrate & ammonium nitrate) were supplemented to all the three isolates for decolorization of  dyes. 
Out of above all, combination of Maltose and Yeast extract showed good results.  
As number of studies also reported, supplementation of co -substrate (C & N sources) showed no 
significant effect on decolorization. In present study combination of Malt ose and Yeast extract 
showed good decolorization percent but not as high as in case of simple nutrient broth (Table 1 & 
Fig.3).  
Decolorization of Textile Effluents by Consortium  
Due to efficient decolorization capability, these isolates could be used to d evelop microbial 
consortium for the decolorization and complete mineralization of dyes from textile effluent. The 
textile effluents from Nahar textile industry Lalru (Punjab) were designated as L1, L2 & Bhiwani 
textile mill (Haryana) were designated as B1,  B2. The combination of yeast extract and maltose 
was able to decolorize textile effluent L1, L2, B1 & B2 in concentration of 0.3% of both C & N 
sources in 12 h, 3 days, 12 h and 4 days with 100, 88, 100 & 100% respectively. All three microbes 
in their com bination showed effective decolorization of the effluent (Table 4).

types of process being used in particular industry. Generally, processes in textile industries were 
carried out at alkaline pH; it was observed that different untreated raw L1, L2, B1, B2 textile 
effluents showed variations in their properties; pH variations of the four effluents were 14, 12, 10

DISCUSSION  
Twenty two morphologically distinct strains were isolated from the different samples collected 
from Nahar Textile Industry. Purified isolates were screened for dye decolorization activity by 
using the nutrient broth amended with dye inoculated with purifie d isolates. Khadijah  et.al., 
(2009)[18], Mahmood et.al., (2011)[19], also used liquid media amended with dye for screening of 
bacterial isolates for their ability to decolorize the dye. Out of twenty two isolates tested, three 
isolates (RS6, DS6 &  S6IV) exhibited best activity of dye decolorization. So, all three isolates 
showing ability of dye decolorization were taken for further studies. This paper describes a novel 
study into the identification of diversity of microbes in MTCC Chandigarh, using  16 S rRNA 
analyses . Selected bacterial strains were identified as Fictibacillus gelatini , Bacillus subtilis 
inaquosorum  and Bacillus subtilis subtilis , which showed complete decolorization of reactive dyes 
in minimum times of hours without requirement of any external supplement. Optimization of 
culture conditions was desirable for enhancing the dye decolorization activity, which is greatly 
influenced by the physical factors (pH, temperature, inoculum and incubation time) and nutritional 
factors (carbon and  nitrogen sources). These factors play important role in the growth of bacteria 
and dye decolorization. No defined medium has been established for the best dye decolorization. 
Each organism or strain has its own special requirements for maximum dye decolor ization activity.  
 pH has a major effect on the efficiency of dye decolorization; b acterial cultures generally exhibit 
maximum decolorization at neutral pH [20] and exhibit decolorization ability in the range of pH 5 -
8 [21]. All the three isolates showed o ptimum results at pH 7 and the pH range of our culture was 
reported to be between 6 -10. Klebsiella pneumonia  RS-13 has been reported to completely degrade 
methyl red in the pH range of 6 -8 [22]. E. coli  and Pseudomonas luteola  both exhibited best 
decolori zation at pH 7 with constant decolorization rate upto pH 9.5 [22], [23]. Maximum  ISSN: 2320-0294Impact Factor: 6.765

 decolorization of 97.92% of dye RR195 by Georgenia  at pH -7 was reported by Sahasrabudhe et 
al., (2012) [21]. Temperature is another very important parameter for the treatment of wastewater.  
The growth of microorganisms can be inhibited at one temperature but it can be activated at 
another temperature. So, it is essential to incubate microorganisms at their optimum incubation 
temperature for their successful growth. In present s tudy at higher temperature decolorization 
slowly decreased and efficient decolorization was reported at 37°C. Alcaligenes sp . APO4 
exhibited higher potential at 37°C to decolorize and detoxify the dyes effluent up to 92.6% and 
83.9% respectively after 24 days of incubation [24].  
The amount of inoculum used for dye decolorization also affects the activity of dye decolorization.  
To ensure a maximum decolorization of dye in the limited volume of medium, the microorganism 
inoculum size should therefore be controlled. Optimum inoculum size for complete decolorization 
of dyes was observed to be 10% (v/v). These results are similar to  Sahasrabudhe et al., 2012 [21]. 
They suggested optimum inoculum size of 10% in their study on decolorization of the Reactive 
Red 195 by bacterial isolate  Georgenia . Mohan et al., 2013 [25], also reported high decolorization 
% of Coractive blue -3R with 10%  inoculum sizes of Bacillus sp. & Plaococcus  sp.  
Selection of best microorganism was done on the basis of effective decolorization even at high dye 
concentrations (100, 200, 500 and 1000mg/l).  In this case decolorization percent is constantly or 
progressi vely increased with dye conc. upto 500mg/l of dye after which decolorization percent 
starts to decrease at higher conc. (Table 2).Shilpa et al., (2012) [8] reported 100% decolorization of 
RY145 (50 mg/l) by B. boroniphilus  within 9 h at shaking conditions but they observed percent 
decolorization inversely proportional  to dye concentration, where at conc. of 500 mg/l there was 
negligible decolorization of reactive yellow 145 at 24 h.  The maximum decolorization of Reactive 
red HE8b by DN1 was observed at 200  mg/l of dye concentration [3] and of Reactive yellow 107, 
Reactive red 198, Reactive black 5 and Direct blue 71 by Bacillus  spp. ETL -1979 at 100 mg/l of 
dye concentration [26]. Georgenia  Sp.CC -NMPT -T3 could decolorize Reactive red 195 at 50 mg/l 
of dye co nc. in 5 h whereas it took 48 h to decolorize 92.08% at 250 mg/l. The culture showed 
decolorizing ability upto 200 mg/l at a faster rate after which the rate began decreasing [21]. It has 
been proposed that dye concentration can influence the efficiency of  microbial decolorization 
through a comination of factors including the toxicity imposed by dye at higher concentration [22], 
[27].  
The most important dye degrading enzymes are: azoreductases, laccases and peroxidases.  Some 
bacterial strains produce diffe rent kinds of enzymes whereas others produce only one or two of 
them. These enzymes have a great potential in various biotechnological processes mainly due to 
their high non -specific oxidation capacity, the lack of requirement for cofactors, and the use of  the 
readily available molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor [28 -30]. Fictibacillus gelatini  & 
Bacillus subtilis inaquosorum  showed higher Laccase & Azoreductase activity, as compared to 
other enzymes & Bacillus subtilis subtilis  possessed higher activi ty of enzyme azoreductase at pH 7 
and 37°C with 100% decolorization of all three Reactive dyes after 4 -18 hrs of incubation period. 
Shah et al., 2013 [31] reported azoreductase activity at 37°C, pH 7, for decolorization of 93% of 
Reactive black dye.  
Textil e industrial effluent that is deficient in carbon content and biodegradation without any extra 
carbon source was very difficult [32]. Out of all above mentioned C&N sources combination of 
Maltose and Yeast extract showed good results. In present study comb ination of Maltose and Yeast 
extract showed good decolorization percent but not as high as in case of simple nutrient broth 
(Table 1 & Fig.3). Either they showed similar results as obtained in nutrient broth or showed less 
decolorization with supplementati on. This suggests that carbon and nitrogen sources acted as 
catabolite repessors. Accordingly to other reports study decolorization efficiency of Bacillus  sp. 
CH12 was significantly enhanced with carbon (≥98%) and organic nitrogen ( ∼100%) supplements 
with concentrations (50−250 mg/l) of dye Reactive red 239 [33]. Similarly with 1% glucose, 1% 
yeast extract and 1% starch, where % decolorization was upto 92.22%, 94.00% and 92.88% 
respectively [34]. At a dye conc. of 500 mg/l and in absence of yeast extract th e decolorization was 
found to be 81.94%, after 70 hrs suggesting that the organism could utilize organic dye as sole C 
sources [17]. Similarly reports observed by Throat et al., 2010 [35] supports our study by 
decolorizing crystal violet azo dye to 91.03 a nd 91.90%, when CD11 culture were used without and 
with co - substrate (1% glucose) respectively.   ISSN: 2320-0294Impact Factor: 6.765

 The textile effluents from Nahar textile industry, Lalru (Punjab) & Bhiwani textile mill (Haryana) 
were used for the study of decolorization and complete mine ralization of dyes from textile effluent. 
These isolates not only decolorized the reactive dyes effluent but also disperse dye effluent along 
with the reduction in cost of effluent treatment process.  The significance of this study is that, 
isolates almost  completely decolorize these textile effluents and convert them from opaque to 
transparent. These isolates not only degrade or remove the dyes from these effluents but also 
decreased their COD, TDS and TSS within permissible limit. The values of BOD and CO D were 
less in the treated sample in comparison to the very high values of BOD and COD in effluent [36], 
[37].  
CONCLUSIONS  
Textile effluent and sludge produced by effluent treatment plant is rich source of dye decolorizing 
bacterial population. From the present study, it can be concluded that these three isolates have very 
high decolorization potential and take only upto 4 -18 h at temperature of 37°C, pH -7 and at static 
condition of growth for completely degradation of Reactive dyes: Reactive yel low 15, Reactive 
yellow 145 and Reactive red 195 at very high concentration of 500 mg/l,  with no requirement of 
any carbon and nitrogen sources,  which has not been reported earlier . 
The present study indicates that biodegradation of Reactive dyes  by Bacill us sp.  were mediated by 
different enzymes like laccase, lignin peroxidase, azoreductase and tyrosinase that were produced 
in simple medium of nutrient broth. T his study is quite significant as the rate of dye decolorization 
does not decrease with increasin g concentration of dyes which is reported by due to the toxic effect 
of dyes on degrading microorganisms or the blockage of active sites of enzymes by dye molecule 
with different structures. So, these isolates may serve as remarkable tool for decolorizatio n and 
detoxification of reactive dyes in cheaper way by decolorizing maximum (500 mg/l) conc. of 
textile dyes in lesser time with no or very less additional requirement of co -substrate.
