Abstract 
Background and purpose:  The textile dyes are considered as important pollut ants due to the 
toxicity on human and environment. Therefore, the d ye removal from industrial effluents is 
necessary. This study evaluates the ability of Azol la for the adsorption of acid black 1  (AB1) dye 
from aqueous solution. 
Materials and Methods:  This was an experimental-laboratory study. The Azol la biomass was 
sun dried, crushed and sieved to particle sizes in the range of 1-2 mm. Then, it treated with 0.1 M 
HCl for 5 h, followed by washing with distilled wat er, and it used as an adsorbent. The effect of 
study parameter was investigated, and the residues AB1 concentration was measured by DR2800 
spectrophotometer at in λmax  = 622 nm . 
Results:  The results indicated that the efficiency of AB1 ad sorption decreased with increased 
initial dye concentration. It increased with increa sed contact time and adsorbent. The highest 
adsorption efficiency was occurred at pH = 2. The e quilibrium data were the best fitted on 
Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic m odel. 
Conclusion:  The Azolla could present high ability in dye remov al. Therefore, it can be used as 
inexpensive and effective adsorbent in textile effl uent treatment.

 1. Introduction 
The application of dyes is common in many 
industries such as textile, paper, leather, 
food, plastic, cosmetic industries, etc. (1, 2). 
The textile industries are known as 
significant dye consumer and major colorful 
wastewater producer (3). The dyes are 
defined as organic molecules with complex 
aromatic structure (4, 5). Owing to their 
properties, the dyes can create an esthetic 
issues and many risks to public health (6, 7). 
Some health risks can imply to mutagenic 
and carcinogenic activity, dermatitis and, etc. 
(8). Therefore, the treatment of textile 
effluent and especially dye removal is 
necessary. It has been reported that the acid 
and reactive dyes are resistant against the 
conventional treatment methods (5, 9). 
Consequently, the many techniques such as 
membrane separation, electrochemical, 
flocculation-coagulation, reverse osmosis, 
ozone oxidation, biological treatments, etc. 
were assessed for dye removal (10). 
However, it discovered that the mentioned 
techniques are faced with many limitations 
such as high cost, formation of hazardous by-
products and intensive energy requirements. 
For that reason, it is a significant need to find 
a simple, inexpensive and efficient method to 
remove the dyes (11). The literature review 
indicated that the adsorption process is a 
cost-effective technique to dye removal (12). 
Although the activated carbon is a promising 
adsorbent, however it is an expensive 
adsorbent, which leads the researchers try to 
find a low-cost and effective adsorbents (13). 
The several researches have been conducted on different material such as chitosan, banana 
peel, coconut shell, rice husk, canola etc  
(14-20). Meanwhile, researchers are studying 
an another adsorbent that derived from an 
algae called Azolla. Azolla filiculoides has 
been used in many studies for pollutant 
removal. Table 1 shows the results of 
previous studies on pollutant removal by 
Azolla  
(21, 22). It can be found in northern of Iran, 
particularly in Anzali wetland. The algae 
grow quickly and cover the surface of 
stagnant water and lakes. The rapid growth of 
this algae produce negative effects on the 
environment if Azolla is used as an 
adsorbent, it can control their growth  
(23, 24). The purpose of this study are to 
investigate of the ability of Azolla biomass 
for acid black 1 (AB1) adsorption; to assess, 
the effect of several parameters, including 
contact time, pH, initial dye concentration, 
adsorbent dose on dye adsorption; and to 
study the isotherm and kinetics of adsorption. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Materials 
The AB1 dye was purchased from Alvan 
Sabet Co (Iran). The desired concentration of 
dye solution was prepared by dilution of 
stock solution (1000 mg/L). Table 2  
presents the general characteristics and 
chemical structures of AB1 by  
manufacturer. All chemicals used in this 
research were of analytical reagent grade, 
which were supplied from Merck. Co 
(Germany). Deionized water was used for  
all dilutions.

 2.2. Adsorbent preparation 
A. filiculoides was collected from the rice 
paddies of Sari, Iran. It was dried in the sun 
and then were crushed and sieved to 1-2 mm 
particle sizes for using as an adsorbent. The 
biomass were treated with 0.1 M HCl for 5 h, 
followed by washing with distilled water and 
then dried (25). The surface morphology of 
adsorbent was observed with a scanning 
electron microscope (SEM) before and after 
adsorption process.

2.3. Batch adsorption experiments 
By reviewing of performed studies, it was 
discovered that contact time, pH, initial dye 
concentration and adsorbent dose can attribute 
as the effective parameter on the adsorption 
process. It is reported that the dye 
concentration in textile effluent is between 10 
and 200 mg/l; therefore, the initial dye 
concentration was selected 25, 50, 75,100, 
125, 150, 175, and 200. The effect of 
adsorbent dosage, contact time and pH were 
studied in a range of (0.2-2 g), (10-240 min) 
and (2-11), respectively. The pH of dye 
solution was regulated by NaOH and H 2SO 4. 
The experiments in a batch system were 
carried out in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. In 
each adsorption experiment, certain amount 
adsorbent was added to the Erlenmeyer with 
known concentration of dye. The samples 
were mixed by shaker with 180 rpm for 120 
min. Then the samples were centrifuged at 
3600 rpm for 10 min . This study was done 
according on optimization of each parameter. 
For example to obtain the optimum contact 
time, all parameters assumed constant except contact time. The contact time was varied 
between 10 and 240 min and the time with 
maximum dye removal is considered as 
optimum contact time. This time was constant 
in next steps. This is continued in the next 
experiments to find the other optimum 
parameters. The experiments repeated 2 times, 
and the number of samples was 78. Samples 
were measured using a spectrophotometer 
(DR2800) at 622 nm. The dye removal 
percentage  (R) and the amount of adsorbed 
dye on adsorbent, qe (mg/g), were calculated 
by equations 1 and 2, respectively.

Where qe is the amount of adsorbed dye per 
unit mass of adsorbent (mg/g), C0 and Ce are 
the initial and the equilibrium concentrations of 
dye solution (mg/L), respectively. V is the 
volume of the dye solution (L), and M is the 
mass of the adsorbent (27). 
2.4. Adsorption isotherms and kinetics 
The equilibrium adsorption isotherm is used 
to design of adsorption systems. Among the 
several isotherm models, the Langmuir and 
Freundlich isotherm were selected isothermic 
studies. The equations of these isotherms 
described in the previous studies. The 
Langmuir adsorption isotherm is applied to 
equilibrium adsorption assuming monolayer 
adsorption onto a surface with a finite number 
of identical sites. Furthermore, the kinetic 
mechanism in the AB1 adsorption process 
was investigated using the pseudo-first-order 
and pseudo-second-order model that was 
described in other research (20, 28). 
 
3. Results  
3.1. SEM analysis  
The SEM provides the surface information. 
The surface structure of the adsorbent was

 observed with SEM at different 
magnifications. The SEM images show in 
figure 1. The images clearly depicted that 
surface topography/morphology and internal 
architecture of adsorbent were different 
before and after using adsorption processes. 
The adsorbent had irregular and porous 
structure before using (Figure 1a); however, 
remarkable dye adsorption was indicated in 
figure 1b as it can be seen the adsorption 
surface of the adsorbent is saturated after dye adsorption that it mentioned in previous 
studies, also (17). 
 
3.2. The effect of contact time 
The AB1 adsorption efficiency increases by 
increasing the contact time. As it has shown in 
figure 2, there is a sharp slope in the initial 
time of the adsorption process. It decreases 
after 120 min, and the dye removal efficiency 
is constant over this time. This time is 
considered as equilibrium time.

 3.3. The effect of pH 
Figure 3 shows that the pH can influence on 
AB1 removal percentage. As it is observed an 
increase of pH leads to decreasing the dye 
removal efficiency. This indicated that 
maximum removal efficiency dye was 
observed in acidic condition and in pH =2.

efficiency 
 
3.4. The effect of adsorbent dose 
The adsorption efficiency increases by an 
increase in adsorbent dose up to 10 g/L. It 
reaches equilibrium after those doses. 
Although the adsorption efficiency increases 
by increasing in adsorbent dose, however the 
adsorption rate per unit mass of adsorbent (qe) 
decreases. The effect of adsorbent dose is 
presented in figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4. The effect of adsorbent dose on acid black 1 
removal efficiency 3.5. The effect of initial dye concentration 
The results show that the dye removal 
efficiency decreases by increasing dye 
concentration from 25 to 200 mg/L. the effect 
of initial dye concentration on removal 
efficiency is shown at figure 5. As shown in 
this figure, the dye removal percentage is 96% 
for dye concentration of 25 mg/L. It decreases 
to 30% for the concentration of 200 mg/L.

removal efficiency  
 
3.6. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms 
The results of isothermal and kinetics studies 
of dye adsorption are presented in figures 6  and 
7. As can be observed, the equilibrium data 
were the best fitted on Langmuir isotherm and 
pseudo-second-order kinetic model. 
 
4. Discussion 
As it implied in previous studies, the 
absorbent specific surface area is an important 
parameter in adsorption efficiency. There is a 
direct relationship between the amount of 
surface area and dye removal efficiency. The 
adsorbent surface area of Azolla is 36 m 2/g, 
which it is greater than some other studied 
adsorbents (8, 15). 
The results indicated that the AB1 removal 
efficiency increased with increasing of contact 
time. The greater contact between dye 
molecules and adsorbent surface is attributed 
as this event reasons which this agrees with 
many studies (15, 29). 00.25 0.5 0.75 1

Also, it is observed that the adsorption 
process is rapidly at the beginning. However, 
it decreases and reaches equilibrium after 90 
min which this can be described by the 
presence of the most active sites on the 
surface area of the adsorbent and the 
saturation of these sites by AB1 molecules 
with time. This is consistent with the Zazouli 
et al study on RR198 removal by Azolla (8). 
The pH is a significant parameter in 
adsorption process which it can affect on the 
adsorbent characteristics and dye chemistry 
(25). The highest AB1 removal efficiency is 
obtained in pH = 2 and it decreases with an 
increase in pH value. The results of this study 
are confirmed by several previous studies on 
dye removal. The electrostatic interaction 
between the surface of the adsorbent and the 
dye can attribute as the greater dye removal in acidic pH. Since the adsorbent surface is 
positive in acidic pH, therefore, the AB1 (an 
anionic dye) has better interaction with the 
adsorbent surface and the dye removal 
increases. The negative charge of adsorbent in 
alkali pH will reduce the anionic dye removal 
(30, 31).  The adsorbent dose is another 
parameter that can influence the dye removal 
efficiency. As it mentioned, the dye removal 
increased with increasing the adsorbent 
dosage up to 10 mg/L which it can be due to 
the increasing the available adsorption sites 
for dye molecules; however the amount of 
adsorbed AB1 per unit mass of adsorbent (qe) 
decreased which it is observed in several 
studies (8, 15, 32).  As it was observed the 
AB1 removal efficiency decreased from 96% 
to 30%  for initial dye concentration of 25 and 
200 mg/L, respectively. This indicates that R² = 0.9349

 IJHS 2014; 2(3): 30  
 there is an inverse relationship between initial 
dye concentration and dye removal percentage 
which it is agreed with the previous studies 
(33, 34). This can be due to that there is 
greater competition between the dye 
molecules to adsorb on limited active surface 
of the adsorbent with increasing the dye 
concentration (35). The kinetic studies 
indicated that the AB1 adsorption onto Azolla 
is better fitted on the pseudo-second-order 
kinetic (R 2= 0.9986) model than the pseudo-
first-order model (R 2 = 0.7335). These results 
are similar to other studies on dye removal 
(36). Furthermore, the compression between 
the correlation coefficient of Langmuir and 
Freundlich indicated that the equilibrium data 
are better followed on Langmuir isotherm, 
which it is consistent with the conducted study 
by Zazouli et al (28). 
The study indicated that the Azolla has 
significant ability in AB1 dye removal and 
can be used to treat the textile effluent. The 
studied parameter can affect on dye removal 
efficiency.
