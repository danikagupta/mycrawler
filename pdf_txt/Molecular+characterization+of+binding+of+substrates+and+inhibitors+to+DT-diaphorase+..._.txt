In Chen S, Wu K, Zhang D, Sherman M, Knox R, and Yang CS (1999) Molecular characterization of binding of substrates and
inhibitors to DT-diaphorase: Combined approach involving site-directed mutagenesis, inhibitor-binding analysis, and com-puter modeling. Mol Pharmacol 56:272â€“278, Figure 2 on page 275 should have been published in color. We regret any
inconvenience caused by this error. The color version of the figure is given below with its legend.
Fig. 2. A, crystal structure of rat DT-diaphorase. Pro187 is shown in
white. A Pro187 to Ser mutation would disturb the structure of the
central parallel b-sheet (yellow), resulting in a reduction in the binding
affinity of FAD (green). B, predicted binding orientation of CB1954(shown in colors according to the atom type). The sites of mutation areshown in purple. C, predicted binding orientation of dicoumarol. D, pre-dicted binding orientation of chrysin. E, predicted binding orientation ofphenindone.Erratum 849 at ASPET Journals on August 29, 2024 molpharm.aspetjournals.org Downloaded from
