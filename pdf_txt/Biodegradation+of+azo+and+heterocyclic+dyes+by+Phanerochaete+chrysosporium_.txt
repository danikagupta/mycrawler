This study presents decolorization of textile azo dye, Orange II, by white rot fungus, Phaner ochaete chr ysosporium .
Orange II (85%) was removed in 7 days (optimum decolorization on 5th day at 28-30°C and pH 5.0) in liquid cultures under
shaking aerobic conditions using P. chr ysosporium . Higher dye concentration in simulated dye showed inhibitory ef fects on
decolorization. Decolorization ability of fungus was correlated to lignolytic enzyme activity .

Introduction
Azo dyes account for most textile dyestuf f produced
and are most commonly used synthetic dyes in textile
industry1. About 10-15% of dyes goes unused in textile
effluents2,3. In mammals, azo dyes are reduced to aryl
amines by cytochrome p450 and a flavin dependent
cytosolic reductase4. Anaerobic breakdown of azo dyes
can lead to reduction of azo bond producing mutagenic
and carcinogenic compounds5. Most synthetic dyes are
not degraded by conventional physical and chemical
processes6,7. Fungi or their oxidative enzymes can
decolorize textile wastewater either by adsorption of
dye on fungal mycelium or by oxidative degradation
of dye molecule8. White rot fungi have emer ged as
promising or ganism for treating color from
wastewater9,10.
Decolorization of azo, anthraquinone, heterocyclic,
triphenylmethane and polymeric dyes by white rot
fungus Phaner ochaete chr ysosporium have been
reported11,12. P. chr ysosporium  produces extracellular
manganese peroxidase (MnP), which may be
responsible for degradation of xenobiotic compounds
from wastewater13, effluent decolorization and
bioleaching of kraft pulp14-16. MnP oxidizes Mn(II) to
Mn(III), which is responsible for oxidation ofcompound like phenolic compounds17. P. chrysosporium
is also able to produce lignin peroxidases (LiP) and
laccases, which are also capable to degrade xenobiotic
compounds18-20. Several reports21,22 have shown that
lignolytic enzymes are directly involved in degradation
process. Zhang et al23 reported high decolorization
efficiency of azo dye Orange II using white rot fungus.
Azo dyes degradation without formation of aromatic
amines using white rot fungi have also been reported24,25.
This paper reports ability of white rot fungus,
P. chrysosporium,  and its enzymes to decolorize Orange
II in liquid systems, besides role of enzymatic activity
on color removal.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
PDB used for liquid fungal culture was purchased from
Hi-Media (Bombay), and azo dye Orange II was procured
from Nahar Fabrics, Lalru (Punjab) India. Chemicals used
for enzyme assay (phenol red, H2O2, NaOH) were
purchased from Loba - Chemicals (Bombay).
Micr oorganism and Cultur e Media
P. chrysosporium  (MTCC 4955) culture was obtained
from IMTECH, Chandigarh, India. L yophilized culture
was brought in laboratory and stored at 4°C.
To maintain fungal strain on potato dextrose agar
(PDA), PDB (20 ¼l) was added to broken vial of pure158 J SCI IND RES   VOL 68   FEBRUAR Y  2009
culture and a loopful of inoculum was streaked on PDA
plates. Further , strain was maintained on PDA slants and
stored at 4°C prior to inoculating into liquid media. For
liquid cultures, PDB media was used. PDA plates were
incubated statically at 25°C for one week before use.
Erlenmeyer flasks (250 ml) containing sterilized liquid
dye (100 ml) containing medium were inoculated with
10 mm agar plugs taken from fungal colony growing on
PDA plate and incubated in aerobic condition in an
incubator shaker at 150 rpm for 7 days.
Decolorization Assay
Effect of pH (4.0-7.0) on biodegradation was studied
and pH was maintained using 0.1 N HCl or 0.1N NaOH.
Effect of temperature was studied for 24, 26, 28, 30, 32
and 34°C. Dif ferent concentrations of dyes (50, 100, 150,
200 and 250 mg/l) were prepared and studied. In all
experiments, agitated liquid cultures were grown for 7
days in an incubator shaker . Samples (8 ml) were
withdrawn at alternate days, centrifuged at 4000 rpm and
supernatant was scanned at 486 nm ( λmax for Orange II)
for absorbance in a UV-V isible spectrophotometer . All
experiments were performed in duplicates. Controls were
maintained without dye. Decolorization was calculated
as
Decolorization (%) = ( )

where, Co is initial concentration of dye (mg/l) and Ce is
residual dye concentration (mg/l) at dif ferent time
intervals.
Enzyme Assays
MnP activity26 was performed. For preparation of
inocula, fungi were grown on PDA plates. Erlenmeyer
flasks having liquid media were inoculated with mycelia
plugs (cut from edge of actively growing colony).
Cultures were incubated at 25°C for 7 days in an incubator
shaker (150 rpm). Culture was filtered through muslin
cloth and final volume was made 50 ml. Filtrate was
centrifuged at 7500 rpm for 10 min to obtain crude
enzyme for enzyme assay . For preparation of reaction
mixture (1000 µl), 0.1 mmol Phenol Red (800 µl) was
taken in test tube, crude enzyme (50 µl) was added to it
and reaction mixture was incubated at 20°C for 15 min.
Reaction started with 0.1 m mol addition of hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2, 100 µl) in one set of test tube and onewas kept without H2O2. Reaction was terminated with
4.0 M NaOH (50 ¼l). Enzymatic activity was
determined spectrophotometrically . One unit of enzyme
activity is expressed as the amount of enzyme required
to oxidize 1.0 µmol of Phenol Red in one min. Activity
in absence of H2O2 was subtracted from values obtained
in presence of H2O2 to establish true peroxide activity .
All experiments were carried out in dark. All treatments
were run in triplicates. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100

Results and Discussion
Effect of pH on Decolorization of Orange II
Effect of pH (3.0-7.0) was investigated, keeping other
parameters constant (temp 30°C and dye conc. 50 mg/l).
As pH increased from highly acidic conditions (pH 3 to
pH 4.0), decolorization increased from 39.84 to 71.56%
(Fig. 1a). Optimum decolorization of dye (86.34%) was
found at pH 5.0, with further decrease 69.56% and 51.42%
for pH 6.0 and 7.0 respectively . Maximum removal of color
was observed at 7th day for all studied pH. Since no
significant change in removal of Orange II by studied
fungus was observed after 5th day , thus 5th day was
optimum decolorization.
Effect of Initial Dye Concentration on Decolorization of Orange II
Effect of varying dye concentration on dye degradation
was investigated keeping other operational parameters
constant (temp 30°C and pH 5). For 50 and 100 mg/l
concentration of dye, removal was almost same but as
concentration increased, removal of dye started decrease
(Fig. 2). About 85% of dye was removed on 5th day of 100
mg/l of dye.
Effect of T emperatur e on Dye Removal
To explore temperature ef fect, experiments were
performed at dif ferent temperatures (24-34°C) keeping
other conditions constant (pH 5.0, dye conc. 50 mg/l).
Initially there was an increase in dye degradation rate upto 30°C and afterward dye degradation decreased (Fig.
3a). Maximum degradation was observed between 28-
30°C.
Decolorization Experiments with T extile Industr y
Wastewater
Untreated dark brown ef fluent from a local textile
industry gave following physico-chemical values: total
solids, 7.21 g/l; total carbon, 3.16 g/l; COD, 3268 mg/
l; and pH 9.0. Maximum degradation (79%) was
observed between 28-30°C and pH 5.0 (Fig. 3a).
Maximum decolorization was recorded from 3rd to 5th
day and afterward little change was recorded. A little
decline in decolorization rate was observed when
experiments were performed with real textile
wastewater , might be due to presence of other
pollutants in textile wastewater (Fig. 3b).
Mn-per oxidase Activity
MnP is involved in dye decolorization by
P. chr ysosporium . On, MnP activity was calculated
as: 1st day, 43; 3rd day, 137; and 5th day, 249 U/l. After
7 days of incubation, liquid culture showed maximum
MnP activity (265 U/l).  P. chrysosporium  has degraded
a wide variety of compounds including an extensive
number of azo dyes27-29. Biodegradation of azo dyes
by P. chr ysosporium  is reported30 to be based on
activity MnP . Several products of lignin degradation
could act as redox mediators and thus enhance160 J SCI IND RES   VOL 68   FEBRUAR Y  2009
enzymatic base degradation of azo dyes30. In present
study , degradation of Orange II was found dependent
on temperature and pH. Fungus showed maximum
degradation in slightly acidic conditions (pH 5.0). In
highly acidic conditions, a decrease in decolorization
rate may be due to decrease in enzymatic activity when
pH changed from optimum levels. Dye concentration
(50-100 mg/l), showed little change in decolorization
rate, but higher dye concentration had inhibitory ef fect
on fungus thereby reducing color removal. Orange II
with three aromatic rings and one sulphonic group, has
complex structure and it is very dif ficult to degrade such
dye in higher concentrations. Small structural dif ferences
can af fect decolorization owing to dif ferences in electron
distribution, char ge density and steric factors 31. Activity
of MnP in P. chr ysosporium  cultures indicates that
enzyme plays an important role in degradation of Orange
II. Fungus has an enormous potential for biodegradation
of wastewater of a local textile industry .
Conclusions
Temperature, pH and initial dye concentration had a
major influence on dye removal by white rot fungus  P.chrysosporium . Ezymatic activity of selected fungus is
possible mechanism involved in removal of dye. Thus
any bioprocesses based dye removal system using such
type of fungus should be design on the basis of these
parameters for successful operation.
