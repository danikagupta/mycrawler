Abstract
Neural activity and behavior are both notoriously variable, with responses
differingwidely between repeated presentation of identical stimuli or trials.
Recent results in humans and animals reveal that these variations are not

INTRODUCTION
The activity of the brain is constantly varying,wandering between states,and profoundly affect-
ing not only our neural responses to sensory inputs but also our ability to process this influx of
information, make decisions, and take appropriate action. Indeed, our entire inner world, both
cognitively and emotionally,is in a constant state of flux,flittering from state to state,thought to
thought. Ever since Richard Caton (1887) performed the first recordings from the mammalian
brain in the late 1800s, it has been known that the patterns of activity generated depend on the
behavioral state of the animal.
Today,withadvancesinimagingtechnology,itispossibletomonitornetworkactivitythrough-
out large parts of the brain at a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales. These technological
advances have led to a new level of observation of rapid variations in the waking brain and how

neuromodulators to the large-scale network activity [e.g.,as revealed by functional magnetic res-
onance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG)]
associated with perception and cognition. We first discuss a tentative framework for classifying
variations of spontaneous brain activity into states and how these impact neural circuit function
andbehavior.Wethenprovideareviewofrecentliteratureonthemodulatoryandnetworkmech-
anisms that may underlie these state changes.
What is a brain/behavioral state,and why is it important? To adequately meet their demands,
animalsmuststitchtogethersensation,memories,expectations,andmotorcommands.Allofthese
tasks run on a highly variable background of ongoing neuronal activity in the brain.Rather than
reflecting random electric noise generated by ensembles of neurons,these variations represent a
multiplexing of the various needs of the nervous system and are tightly linked to the behavioral
context of the animal. This behavioral context relates in part to changes in the level of arousal,
motoractivity,andattention.Apartfrombehavioralcontext,variationsinongoingactivityarealso
impacted by a wide variety of housekeeping tasks,and some patterns of activity may even simply
arise as a byproduct of the brain’s anatomical and physiological architecture (McCormick & Bal
1997,McCormick et al.2015,Steriade et al.1993,Tononi & Cirellu 2014,Xie et al.2013).
The state of the brain at any given time can be thought of as a point in an extremely high-
dimensional space,where its position along each dimension corresponds to the activity of a rele-
vantneuralunit,suchasaneuron,neuronalgroup,orbrainregion.Overtime,constantlyvarying

Behavior and brain activity move through preferred states.( a) Characterization of behavioral and brain
states.Behavioral state typically consists of nested states.Sleep contains substates such as REM and
slow-wave sleep.Waking can be characterized along multiple behavioral or neural dimensions,which vary
rapidly or slowly over time.We hypothesize that plotting these variables in high-dimensional space would
result in clouds of preferred states ( coloreddots ) and preferred trajectories through these states.Not all states
would be discrete—some states would be connected together as a continuum.( b) Brain state continuously
varies in human fMRI activity.A hidden Markov model estimates a number of brain networks (or states) that
are common to all subjects,together with a specific state time course for each subject indicating when each
state is active.The states are characterized by their mean activation and functional connectivity matrix.( Top)

effects on perception,cognition,and behavior.While brain and behavioral states inhabit a high-
dimensional space (e.g., there are a significant number of cognitive, affective, and other states),
current research into circuit mechanisms has been largely limited to a much smaller state space,
such as variations in arousal, attention, engagement, and movement. For the remainder of this
review,we focus on current research on this more limited set of brain/behavioral states.
STATE INFLUENCES CORTICAL ACTIVITY AND
DETECTION/DISCRIMINATION PERFORMANCE
Mouse Studies
The mouse is an ideal system to investigate the cellular and network mechanisms of state-
dependent variations and their relevance for behavior owing to the multiple genetic-based tools
available. Recent studies in mice have examined the effects of variations within the waking state
on go/no go and 2-alternative forced/unforced choice signal-detection tasks (Bennett et al.2013;
Jacobs et al.2018; Lee et al.2016; Lovett-Barron et al.2017; McGinley et al.2015a; Neske et al.

(Lovett-Barronetal.2017;McGinleyetal.2015a;Speedetal.2019,2020;Vyazovskiyetal.2011).
If,however,the sensory stimuli are well above threshold,animals appear able to respond even in
this state (Einstein et al.2017,Fanselow & Nicolelis 1999).
Examining the effects of cortical state on performance in mice has revealed multiple compo-
nents that vary in both spatial (e.g., global versus local) and temporal (e.g., fractions of a second

(e.g., hit rate), which is remarkably similar to the amplitude (relative to pretrial spontaneous ac-
tivity) of the neuronal response initiated by complex sounds in the auditory cortex (McGinley
et al. 2015a) ( Figure 2 b). Optimal performance was achieved in a state of quiet engagement or
readiness, in which sound-evoked activity in the auditory cortex was robust and occurred on a
background of relative quiescence. Reduced accuracy on the behavioral task was associated with
the appearance of slow oscillatory activity in cortical networks or with high arousal and/or loco-
motion (McGinley et al.2015a).
Why might these two states (low arousal with slow oscillations or high arousal with or with-
out locomotion) alter the ability of an animal to detect a near-threshold stimulus? To perform a
stimulus-detection/discrimination task, the nervous system must detect the stimulus and propa-
gate an accurate representation through the decision and motor response networks,with the ac-
tivity neither growing disproportionately nor weakening to ineffectiveness.We hypothesize that
thepresenceoflarge,spontaneous,slowoscillationsdisruptstheaccuratepropagationofsensory-
decision-response activity. At the neural level, the delivery of sensory stimuli during periods of
prominent slow oscillatory activity,such as drowsiness,inattentiveness,and sleep (or anesthesia),
often results in highly variable responses that can initiate either a weak response or a dispro-
portionately large propagating wave of cortical activity, owing in part to the cyclical variations
in network properties (Haider et al. 2007, Hasenstaub et al. 2007, Shu et al. 2003, Stroh et al.
2013,Zagha et al.2013).Interestingly,induction of synchronized low-frequency (but not higher
frequency) oscillations in area V4 of the primate visual cortex can significantly impair the abil-
ity of the animal to make fine sensory discriminations,confirming a disruptive influence of slow
oscillatory activity on cortical sensory processing (Nandy et al.2019).
Suppression of slow rhythms and the initiation of the activated or depolarized cortical state
may tune sensory systems from one of detection to fine discrimination.In this theoretical frame-
work, behavioral and cortical stillness (e.g., reduced activity), while also attentive and engaged,
may be optimal for detection of sensory stimuli (McGinley et al. 2015b). The depolarization
of cortical neurons associated with movement or arousal may enhance sensory discrimination,
in part through multiplicative gain control, which is likely an important mechanism by which
cortical neuronal networks control neuronal responsiveness and therefore the flow of informa-
tion through the highly interconnected cortical network (Ferguson & Cardin 2020, Haider &
McCormick 2009, Murphy & Miller 2003). Rapid multiplicative gain control can be generated
throughtheactivationofbarragesofexcitatory,balancedwithinhibitory,synapticpotentialscom-
ing from other cortical or subcortical neurons (Haider & McCormick 2009, Haider et al. 2007,
Murphy & Miller 2003),such as feedback from frontal motor control regions involved in move-
mentororientation(Bouvieretal.2020,Guitchountsetal.2020,Hilletal.2011,Leinweberetal.
2017,Nelson & Mooney 2016,Schneider & Mooney 2018,Zagha et al.2013).
Movement and/or arousal is strongly associated with the suppression of lower-frequency os-
cillatory activity in both cortical and subcortical structures (McCormick et al.2015,Musall et al.
2019, Petersen 2019, Poulet & Crochet 2018, Reimer et al. 2014, Stringer et al. 2019, Vinck
et al. 2015). At present, it is unknown if this is the result of the central neural mechanisms
of movement generation, per se, or because movement is associated with increases in arousal

(McGinleyetal.2015b).Indeed,recenttheoriesoftheneuralcontrolofstateproposethatmove-
ment and arousal control systems are intimately interlinked (Liu & Dan 2019). In mice, move-
ment has varied effects on cortical activity,depending on cortical region (McGinley et al.2015b,
Niell & Stryker 2010, Petersen 2019, Schneider & Mooney 2018, Shimaoka et al. 2018). Loco-
motion and facial movements (e.g.,whisking) are typically associated with strong depolarizations
in visual,auditory,and somatosensory cortical areas.Voltage-sensitive protein imaging,however,
suggeststhatmovement,andtheassociatedchangeinstate,mayresultincomplexdepolarization
andhyperpolarizationsequencesofdifferentcorticalregions,particularlyoutsideprimarysensory
cortex (Shimaoka et al.2018).Interestingly,even though purposeful movement (e.g.,locomotion
or whisking) results in depolarization of pyramidal neurons in somatosensory, visual, and audi-
tory cortical areas, the effects on responses to sensory stimuli are mixed, with a facilitation in
visual neurons and a suppression in auditory and motor-cortical-projecting somatosensory corti-
calneurons(McGinleyetal.2015b,Petersen2019,Poulet&Crochet2018,Schneider&Mooney
2018,Yamashita & Petersen 2016).Whisking and/or walking not only decreases sensory-evoked
responses in auditory and some somatosensory cortical neurons but also decreases the ability of
animals to accurately detect weak stimuli (Kyriakatos et al.2017,McGinley et al.2015a).This is
not to say, however, that movement suppresses all types of sensory encoding in these pathways.
Movement, especially in the whisker system, is critical to detecting fine features of explored ob-
jects; active whisking appears to enhance,or at least not degrade,sensory coding in pathways hy-
pothesizedtobecriticalforobjectdiscrimination(Yamashitaetal.2013);andobjectdetectioncan
cause a prolonged depolarization in these neurons,even during whisking (Yamashita & Petersen
2016).In the mouse visual system,locomotion has a strong facilitatory effect on visual responses
(Ayaz et al. 2013, Bennett et al. 2013, Niell & Stryker 2010, Polack et al. 2013) and, together
with head movement–related effects, provides information that may be useful in distinguishing
between self- and world-generated movements of visual scenes (Leinweber et al. 2017, Bouvier
etal.2020,Guitchountsetal.2020).Itisnotyetclearhowlocomotionaffectsperformanceonvi-
sualtasks.Inonestudy,locomotionhadamildenhancingeffectonvisualdetection(Bennettetal.
2013),whileinanother,locomotionwithhigharousalwasassociatedwithdecreasedperformance
(Neske et al.2019).
Not all of these state-dependent effects originate in the neocortex. In fact, state shifts affect
nearlyall,orall,partsofthenervoussystem(andbody).Recordingsfromthalamicandprethalamic
structures,and perhaps even the retina,exhibit changes with locomotion in their responsiveness
tosensorystimuli(Eriskenetal.2014,McGinleyetal.2015a,Schröderetal.2019,Steinmetzetal.
2019,Williamson et al.2015).Any comprehensive theory of state-dependent behavior will need
to take these broad effects into account.
Human and Nonhuman Primate Studies
Studies of state effects on performance and cortical neural activity in nonhuman primates have
often focused on attentional effects in the visual system. Selective attention enhances behavioral
performance (Anton-Erxleben & Carrasco 2013,Cohen & Maunsell 2011,Desimone & Duncan
1995, Maunsell 2015, Spitzer et al. 1988), increases the amplitude and reliability of evoked neu-
ronalresponses(Mitchelletal.2009,Nandyetal.2017,Reynolds&Chelazzi2004),anddecreases
correlations between nearby neurons (Cohen & Maunsell 2009, Mitchell et al. 2009, Ni et al.
2018), especially at lower frequencies ( <10 Hz) (Mitchell et al. 2009, Nandy et al. 2017). These
effectsvarywithcorticallayerandcelltype(Nandyetal.2017)andaresimilartothoseoccurring
with arousal (Ruff et al. 2018). Although attention may induce neuronal effects that are similar

time (e.g., shifting attention within fractions of a second to search for precise combinations of
featuressuchasaparticularfaceorobject)(Maunsell&Treue2006,Nobre&vanEde2018).The
cellular, synaptic, and network mechanisms underlying changes in neuronal activity associated
withchangesinattentioninnonhumanprimatesremaintobedetermined,butsomeprogresshas
been made in recent years (e.g.,Buschman & Kastner 2015).Interestingly,it was recently shown
that spatial attention in mice similarly enhances neural responses and behavioral performance,as
isfoundinprimates(Speedetal.2020).Micemaythereforeserveasamodelsysteminthefuture
to dissect the precise neural mechanisms of some attention-related state changes.
Fewer studies in nonhuman primates have focused on state changes that are unrelated to at-
tention.In one such study,the baseline activity of a higher visual area during a visual search task
was found to correlate with the success rate of the monkey and to not be directly related to spa-
tial attention (M.Zhang et al.2014).The fluctuations of this baseline activity may have reflected

Important mechanistic insights into state changes in monkeys that further bridge the gap to
themouseliteraturewererecentlyobtainedinapatch-clampstudy.Whole-cellrecordingsinthe
primary visual cortex of monkeys trained to maintain eye fixation revealed barrages of synaptic
inputsthatcorrelatedwithprominent,butisolated,low-frequencyeventsinthelocalfieldpoten-
tial(LFP)thatwereinsomeregardssimilartothoseofmiceinthequietresting(non-movement)
state (Tan et al. 2014). Visual stimulation during fixation resulted in prolonged depolarization
and synaptic activity,similar to the activated cortical state associated with movement in mice (see
above). This result suggests that the quiet resting state in both mice and primates is associated
with the generation of intermittent action potentials resulting from synchronized (e.g., corre-
lated) activity within a subpopulation of cortical (and subcortical) neurons, initiating barrages
of synaptic potentials that summate and cause action potentials in other postsynaptic neurons.
The activated state (e.g.,active sensation,movement) may then be related to a cessation of these
correlated clusters of action potentials and the generation of a more sustained depolarized state
in which neurons are interacting at a faster time scale,as was previously demonstrated in waking
cats (Steriade et al.2001).
Studies in humans have examined neural state through fMRI, EEG, and MEG. As with ani-
mal studies, these investigations reveal the brain to be continuously active, varying according to
cognitive,emotional,arousal,attentional,and other states.Rather than random,the resting-state
activityofthehumanbrain,asobservedthroughfMRIandMEG,exhibitsstrongcorrelationalre-
lationships,suchthatsubnetworksofcorticalregionsareactivatedwithrepeatingspatiotemporal
structure (reviewed in Petersen & Sporns 2015,Raichle 2015) ( Figure 1 b).
As in animals, fMRI investigations in humans reveal that spontaneous activity can predict
behavioral performance. Using threshold-level auditory/somatosensory detection tasks, it was
found that prestimulus baseline activity in large-scale brain networks, including the thalamus,
the salience network (including insular and anterior cingulate cortex),the frontoparietal network
(FPN), and the default-mode network (DMN), influences detection behavior. Interestingly,
higher prestimulus activity in the FPN and lower prestimulus activity in the DMN were found
to bias subjects toward more hits in the somatosensory task (Boly et al. 2007) but more misses
in the auditory task (Sadaghiani et al. 2009). Whether this reflects a genuine difference between

modalities remains to be tested. Using bistable visual stimuli, Hesselmann et al. (2008) revealed
that prestimulus activity in visual regions selective for particular object categories (houses versus
faces) influenced the subject’s perception of an ambiguous image.
At the level of the EEG (or electrocorticogram), prolonged wakefulness and increased sleep
needareassociatedwithprolongedreactiontimesandincreasedpowerinregionalslowandtheta
activity in humans (Bernardi et al. 2015, Nir et al. 2017). Unit recordings from the medial tem-
poral lobe of patients following prolonged waking revealed increased reaction times in a visual
categorizationtaskthatcorrelatedwithdecreasedneuronalresponseamplitude,longerlatencyin
action potential responses,and reduced desynchronization in slower/theta frequencies (Nir et al.
2017). These results are reminiscent of the increased prevalence of slow oscillations, including
down states (brief cessations of activity), associated with decreased task performance following
sleep deprivation in rodents (Vyazovskiy et al.2011).
The prominent spontaneous alpha ( ∼10 Hz) oscillation is strongly correlated with changes
in human perceptual behavior. Moreover, in line with the idea of nested brain states, both the
power and phase fluctuations of alpha oscillation influence detection performance. Convergent
results across visual and somatosensory domains suggest that reduced alpha oscillation power in
sensory cortex is correlated with increased cortical excitability and biases the subject toward a
higher hit rate in detection tasks (van Dijk et al. 2008, Weisz et al. 2014), perhaps through a
change in detection criterion,without influencing sensitivity (Iemi et al.2017).Interestingly,the
phase of the alpha oscillation may modulate perception such that stimuli presented during the
peak of an alpha wave recorded by EEG are more likely to be detected (Mathewson et al.2009),
andtwoconsecutivestimulipresentedwithinthesamealphacyclearemorelikelytobeperceived

of awake mice found that the highly variable single-trial sensory-evoked responses could be
significantly predicted by the power and phase of LFP in a 2-s prestimulus window (Sederberg
et al. 2019). Using large-scale brain activity patterns from a 2-s prestimulus window, a recent
MEG study in humans found that there are two separate spontaneous brain processes that
influence object recognition behavior in distinct manners (Podvalny et al. 2019) ( Figure 3 a).

Variations in human state and effects on behavior.( a) Using whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG),two separate spontaneous
processes were discovered in the 2-s time window before the onset of a brief visual stimulus: A non-content-specific (NCS) general
process indiscriminately influences visual object recognition by shifting the decision criterion regardless of the content of the stimulus.
By contrast,a content-specific (CS) process influences visual object recognition of specific object categories by enhancing the
recognition sensitivity (i.e.,enlarging the distance between real and scrambled objects) for stimuli from a specific category.The NCS,
but not CS,spontaneous process is correlated with spontaneous fluctuations in pupil size and hence is arousal linked.Panel aadapted

those of unseen trials ( redlines) for people performing a threshold-level visual perception task.The time of stimulus onset is indicated
by circles,and different stimulus orientations are indicated by solid or dashed lines.For seen trials,the voyage of the trajectory through
state space is characterized by a marked increase in velocity following stimulus onset,indicated by the length of black arrows.Unseen
trials,on the other hand,only accelerate minimally following stimulus onset,indicated by the length of gray arrows.Seen and unseen
trajectories remain well separated throughout the trial.For seen trials,across-trial variability decreases substantially following stimulus

Whatisthemechanismoftheinitialbrainstate’sinfluenceonperceptualbehavior?Humanand
animal studies suggest that ongoing activity and evoked responses can negatively interact (Arazi

et al.2019,Steinmetz & Moore 2010).Under a negative interaction,higher prestimulus ongoing
activity,particularlyatlowerfrequencies( <10Hz),resultsinasmallerstimulus-evokedactivation
or even a deactivation. This negative interaction leads to the often-observed stimulus-triggered,
across-trial variability quenching. Building upon this observation, a recent MEG study showed
that,dependingontheinitialstateofthelarge-scaleactivitypatternintheSCPrange,anidentical
threshold-level visual stimulus may trigger the brain to follow distinct trajectories in the state
spacethatresultinseenversusunseenperceptualoutcomes,respectively( Figure 3 b);inaddition,
across-trial variability in seen trials was substantially reduced, suggesting that ongoing activity
negatively interacted with evoked responses (Baria et al.2017,He 2018).

system, where tens of thousands of neurons, or their synaptic inputs, can be monitored through
imaging or extracellular/intracellular recording (Musall et al.2019,Salkoff et al.2020,Steinmetz
et al.2019,Stringer et al.2019).
Intracellular recordings from waking rodents that are voluntarily immobile frequently reveal
cyclical bursts of synaptic potential that initiate action potentials ( Figure 4 ), in a manner that is
reminiscent of the slow oscillation prevalent during drowsiness and sleep (Bennett et al. 2013,
Crochet & Petersen 2006, Gentet et al. 2010, McGinley et al. 2015a, Nelson & Mooney 2016,
Petersen 2019,Polack et al.2013,Poulet & Crochet 2018,Reimer et al.2014).The cortical slow
oscillation is generated in local regions of the cerebral cortex as a recurrent excitation between
pyramidal cells that is balanced by local inhibition (Haider & McCormick 2009, Haider et al.
2006,Sanchez-Vives&McCormick2000,Shuetal.2003,Steriadeetal.2001)( Figure 4 c).These
slow (<4 Hz) rhythms are strongly suppressed by movement (e.g.,whisking,walking) or arousal
(increases in pupil diameter) and can occur locally during drowsiness or in response to sleep de-
privation,prior to the onset of sleep (Huber et al.2004,Nir et al.2011,Vyazovskiy et al.2011).

Pathways and mechanisms involved in rapid modulation of waking cortical state.( a) Graphic illustrating that the rapid modulation of
the state of a region of cortex ( i) may be influenced by other cortical areas (e.g.,feedback; ii); subcortical inputs (e.g.,thalamus; iii); and
modulatory transmitter systems from the basal forebrain ( iv),hypothalamus,or brainstem ( v).(b) Whole-cell recording of a deep-lying
pyramidal cell in auditory cortex during spontaneous variations in behavioral state.During periods of small pupil diameter,the cortical
network may generate slow oscillatory rhythms,presumably through intracortical mechanisms (McCormick et al.2015).Periodically,
this activity is interrupted by microarousals associated with pupil dilations and membrane potential depolarization,owing to a barrage
of synaptic potentials.During a period of walking,the membrane potential depolarizes strongly,slow oscillatory activity is suppressed,
and the pupil dilates,indicating increased arousal.( c) The state of cortical activity can be altered through the stimulation of
corticocortical feedback pathways.In this whole-cell recording of a pyramidal cell in the primary somatosensory cortex,activation of
the feedback pathway from the motor cortex results in a rapid depolarization and cessation of slow rhythmic activity of anesthesia.

pyramidal cells,although the slow oscillatory activity is still suppressed.However,if both the thalamic and cholinergic pathways are

Thepresenceofstrongdepolarizationsofthemembranepotentialofcorticalpyramidalcellsdur-
ingbrieforprolongedmovementsofthebodyandfacesuggestthattheactivityofalargenumber
of cortical neurons is affected by these behaviors.
Inconfirmationofthissuggestionfromintracellularstudies,recordingsinmice,byeitherelec-
trophysiology or 2-photon imaging, have revealed that the activity of large numbers of neurons
throughout the dorsal cerebral cortex, and within select subcortical structures (McGinley et al.
2015a,Schröderetal.2019,Stringeretal.2019),ishighlystatedependent,withthelargestcompo-
nentcorrespondingtomovementsofthefaceandbody( Figure 5 ).Similarly,opticalexamination
of cortical activity on the widefield level in behaving mice revealed complex patterns,the largest
componentofwhichisrelatedtomovementsoftheface(e.g.,whiskers,mouth,tongue,eyes)and
body(e.g.,locomotion)(Musalletal.2019,Salkoffetal.2020)( Figure 5 ).Linearmodelsofthese
broadpatternsofbrainactivity,oneitherthewidefieldorneuronallevel,havebeenabletoexplain
a large fraction (e.g.,25–55%) of the variance of neural activity through examining varying com-
ponents of facial/body movements, arousal (pupil diameter), and task performance (Musall et al.
2019,Salkoff et al.2020,Stringer et al.2019) ( Figure 5 ).The ability of external observations of
behavioral state to explain a significant component of neural activity in the dorsal cortex of mice
indicatesthatthisactivityisnotrandomandindependentofbehavior—itreflectsvariationsinthe
behavioralstateoftheanimalalongmultipledimensions(e.g., Figure 5 e)thatarehighlyinterre-
latedandcorrelated.Forexample,movementsareassociatedwitharousal,andincreasesinarousal
(as measured by pupil diameter) often precede movements. Additionally, in mice, locomotion is
always associated with whisking (although whisking can occur without locomotion).These overt
and coordinated body movements are also related to large changes in the state of other parts of
the body,for example,changes in heart rate,respiration,gut motility,and such.
Although a significant fraction of dorsal cortical activity in mice may be related to behavioral
state, there is still a majority of activity that cannot yet be explained by these measures, particu-
larly when large numbers of single neurons are monitored (Musall et al.2019,Salkoff et al.2020,
Stringer et al.2019).Even so,the degree to which the general activity of the cortex of the mouse
is related to behavioral state and movement is impressive (see Figure 5 ).
NEUROMODULATORY/NEURAL CONTROL OF STATE
Brain state is controlled through slow-acting neuromodulators, which typically are localized
in brainstem/hypothalamic nuclei that have broad projections, as well as local and long-range
rapidly acting excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter pathways (Boucetta et al. 2014, Brown
et al. 2012, Dasgupta et al. 2018, Goard & Dan 2009, Jones 2019, Lee & Dan 2012, Liu & Dan

mutually exclusive. For example, acetylcholine, serotonin, and glutamate can activate both rapid

Movements of the face and body and behavioral state explain a significant portion of ongoing and
trial-related activity in the mouse dorsal cortex.( a) Example time course of running speed ( greenline ),pupil
area (grayline),whisking ( lightblueline ),and first principle component (PC1) of spontaneous population
neuronal activity ( magentadashedline ) in an untrained mouse alternating between behavioral quiescence and
movement.Neuronal activity is shown in the raster plots ( bottom),with neurons sorted vertically by PC1
weighting.( b) A ridge regression linear model was used to fit the pixel-by-pixel amplitude-time course of
wide-field brain activity (e.g.,panel b) in a mouse performing a visual detection task.Regressors used in the
model include unitary variables such as trial type (visual,auditory,catch),intensity of visual stimulus (low or
high),response choice (hit/no response/false alarm),and response time and continuous variables such as
time,motion energy in the entire video,motion energy in the whisker pad only (see panel c),walking speed,
eye movement amplitude,and pupil diameter.The linear model generated spatiotemporal maps of βweights
for each variable (see panels f,g) and was used to predict the amplitude-time course of each pixel of the
widefield movie of cortical activity.Examples of the activity ( blacklines ) and model fit ( graylines) for averaged
regions of pixels in secondary motor cortex (MOs),primary somatosensory cortex (S1),and primary visual
cortex (V1) are shown.( c) Example frame from a video of the mouse face and eye during the performance of
the task.The video was used to examine movements of the face [video motion energy (ME)],whisker pad
(whisk ME),eye,and pupil diameter.( d) The model is able to explain a significant fraction (approximately
35–55%) of neural activity variance during performance of the task.( e) Total and unique explained variance

ionotropicreceptorsandslower-actingmetabotropicpathways.Intherealmofbroadlyprojecting
neuromodulatory pathways, traditional anatomical, recording, stimulation, and lesion studies
have revealed several important groups, including cholinergic brainstem and basal forebrain
nuclei, noradrenergic brainstem nuclei (e.g., locus coeruleus), serotonergic brainstem neurons,
histaminergic hypothalamic cells, and other less-well-investigated pathways (Jones 2019, Lee
& Dan 2012, Muñoz & Rudy 2014, Saper & Fuller 2017, Sara & Bouret 2012) ( Figure 4 ).
Investigations into the actions of these modulatory pathways have revealed their ability to
influencenearlyeveryaspectofbrainfunction.Amajordifficultyinthefieldofneuromodulation
is knowing which of these diverse mechanisms are activated when and how they contribute to
rapid changes in the waking behavioral/cognitive state.
The application of modulatory transmitters, such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, or sero-
tonin, to forebrain neurons can profoundly influence their state of activity and excitability. For
example, the propensity of thalamocortical networks to generate sleep rhythms can be strongly
suppressed through the depolarization of neuronal membrane potential by the reduction of a
resting K+current or enhancement of the h current. In cortical pyramidal cells, activation of
metabotropicreceptors,forexample,byacetylcholineornorepinephrine,oftenchangesneuronal
excitability through the activation or reduction of resting or activity-dependent K+currents
(Zagha & McCormick 2014). While reduction of K+currents typically occurs over the time
course of seconds,the activation of K+currents is faster,occurring over a period of hundreds of
milliseconds. These changes in neuronal excitability are likely to be relevant to the changes in
brain state in this temporal scale (hundreds of milliseconds to seconds).
Intracellular recordings ( Figure 4 ), or simultaneous multiple neuronal extracellular record-
ings ( Figure 5 ), reveal that the transitions from stillness to movement (and importantly vice
versa) are associated with rapid ( <100 ms) transitions in the state of neuronal activity within
cortical networks. Could these rapid transitions be mediated by the activity of cholinergic or

noradrenergic transmitter pathways? Monitoring the activity of cholinergic and noradrenergic
axons in the neocortex of waking mice reveals that they are strongly activated by facial move-
ments,locomotion,andarousal (Eggermann et al.2014,Lee et al.2014,Reimer et al.2016),sug-
gesting that these transmitter pathways may participate in the network dynamics associated with
the sustained membrane-potential depolarization in pyramidal cells that is associated with these
states(Goard&Dan2009,Meiretal.2018,Metherateetal.1992,Nelson&Mooney2016,Pinto
etal.2013,Polacketal.2013,Sara&Bouret2012)( Figure 4 ).Whilenoradrenergicfibersdonot
activate fast ionotropic responses, acetylcholine can activate nicotinic and muscarinic receptors,
resulting in both rapid and potentially longer-lasting responses. The rapid transition of corti-
cal activity from activated to inactivated in mice with the cessation of movement (e.g., the rapid
hyperpolarization of the membrane potential upon cessation of movement) suggests that long-
lasting metabotropic receptor–mediated neuromodulatory actions are not the main driver of the
movement-associated activated state in mice ( Figures 4 and5),since these would be expected to
persist even after the cessation of neurotransmitter release.
Opticalimagingofdifferentsubtypesofneuronsinthemousevisualcortexduringlocomotion
revealedthatVIPinterneuronsinthesuperficiallayersarestronglyactivatedbylocomotion.This
activity dependence appears to be largely driven by the activation of nicotinic receptors (Fu et al.
2014).TheactivationofnicotinicreceptorscanalsoactivateothertypesofGABAergicinterneu-
rons in the superficial cortex and deep-lying pyramidal cells in some cortical regions (Hedrick &
Waters 2015). The activation of these interneurons can result in either the direct inhibition or
disinhibition of excitatory neurons in the cortex (Dasgupta et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2013; Letzkus
et al. 2011, 2015; Pfeffer et al. 2013; Pi et al. 2013). As stated above, cholinergic (and noradren-
ergic) fibers are strongly activated by movement such as whisking, walking, and arousal (Reimer
etal.2016).Althoughthepathwayforthisrapidactivationofmodulatorypathwaysbymovement
is not yet decisively known,one possibility is that large integrator neurons of the mesencephalic
brainstem form a general arousal system that is sensitive to sensory and motor conditions (Pfaff
et al. 2012). In one study, stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) above or
below the threshold of movements induced cortical changes in V1 that were reminiscent of
those observed during locomotion (Lee et al. 2014). Similar changes were observed when MLR
axon terminals were optogenetically activated in the basal forebrain, which in turn provides
cholinergicinputtovariousbrainregionssuchasV1.Together,theseresultssuggesttheexistence
of a regulatory brainstem circuit that links movement, cholinergic activity, and cortical state
(Figure 4 ).
The activation of VIP, and other types of superficial, interneurons by acetylcholine could
rapidly activate cortical areas through disinhibition. For example, VIP interneurons can inhibit
other interneuron cell types,including somatostatin (SOM)-containing interneurons and parval-
bumin,presumablyfast-spiking,interneurons.SinceSOMinterneuronstargettheapicaldendrites
of pyramidal cells,the hypothesis is that movement may modulate cortical activity through rapid
disinhibition of pyramidal cells,particularly through their apical dendrites (Dasgupta et al.2018;
Lee et al.2013; Letzkus et al.2011,2015; Pfeffer et al.2013; Pi et al.2013).This model suggests
that the depolarization of pyramidal cells associated with locomotion or facial movements (e.g.,
whisking; Figure 4 ) is mediated at least in part by an initial decrease in inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials and a subsequent increase in excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) arriving in the
neurons.These barrages of EPSPs may result in a transition of the cortical network from one of
slow oscillatory activity (such as during drowsiness) to a more sustained pattern of activity, e.g.,
one rich in gamma-band oscillations.
In addition to this disinhibition pathway, thalamic inputs can also rapidly and strongly mod-
ulate activities within the cerebral cortex. This has been particularly well investigated in the

macologically) results in a near complete loss of movement-modulated changes in activity in the
somatosensory cortex (Eggermann et al.2014) ( Figure 4 ).How might cholinergic pathway acti-
vationsuppressnetworkactivitywithoutprolongeddepolarizationoftherecordedneurons?The
endogenous release of acetylcholine can potently inhibit layer 4 excitatory neurons through ac-
tivation of a muscarinic receptor–mediated increase in K+conductance (Dasgupta et al.2018) as
well as inhibit activity through the nicotinic activation of local inhibitory cells (see above). The
multiple pathways by which cholinergic pathways may modulate cortical activity (e.g., nicotinic
activationofinhibitoryneurons,disinhibitionofexcitatoryneurons,muscarinicinhibitionoflayer
4 spiny stellate neurons,muscarinic depolarization of pyramidal cells) give this system consider-
able flexibility.

andincreasesinlocuscoeruleusactivitycanresultinactivationoftheforebrain(e.g.,suppression
of slow oscillatory activity similar to arousal or movement) (Carter et al. 2010, Sara & Bouret

ascendingnoradrenergicpathwayinthereductionofslowoscillatoryactivityandpromotionofde-
polarized(activated)corticalnetworkswithlocomotionand/orarousal(Constantinople&Bruno
2011, Polack et al. 2013). In addition, there is strong evidence that modulation of noradrener-
gic pathways can alter cognitive function through modulation of cortical activities (Arnsten et al.
2012,Aston-Jones&Cohen2005,Sara2009).Inthemouse,thedischargeofcorticalnoradrener-
gicfibersisstronglycorrelatedwithchangesinpupildiameter(Reimeretal.2016),suggestingan
importantroleingeneralarousalandengagementwiththeexternalworld(Aston-Jones&Cohen
2005, Sara & Bouret 2012). The close relationship between arousal and noradrenergic activity
is relatively undifferentiated across the cortex, a hypothesis that is in keeping with the mostly
uniform,concerted activity of noradrenergic neurons and their axons in awake behaving animals
(Reimeretal.2016,Usheretal.1999;L.Collins&D.A.McCormick,unpublishedobservations).
It is possible that, although not yet well investigated, superimposed upon this general activation
mode of locus coeruleus activity, a more regionally specific control of cortical areas may occur
(Chandler et al. 2014, Totah et al. 2018). Interestingly, performance and neural response dur-
ing an auditory detection task exhibit an inverted-U relationship with pupil diameter (arousal)
(Figure 2 b),which may be related to an inverted-U relationship between cognitive performance
and locus coeruleus activity on more complex tasks involving working memory and decision-
making (Arnsten et al.2012,Aston-Jones & Cohen 2005).
Sincemovementhasastronginfluenceonthestateofactivityinthemousecortex,thepossibil-

& Wurtz 2008, Zagha et al. 2013, S. Zhang et al. 2014). Inactivation of frontal cortical regions,
including secondary motor and anterolateral motor cortical areas, is associated with decreased
ability to perform appropriate learned lick responses. These areas exhibit activity during delay
periods between stimulus and motor response that is consistent with attractor network dynam-
ics that may prepare the animal for the response (Guo et al. 2014; Inagaki et al. 2018, 2019; Li

etal.2013)( Figure 4 ).Movementhasastrongeffectonactivitynotonlyinsomatosensorycortex
but also in visual and auditory cortical areas (reviewed in McGinley et al.2015b),although these
effects are not homogenous and may vary even within subdivisions of a sensory cortical region
(Shimaoka et al.2018).There is growing evidence that movement-related modulation of sensory
cortical areas tunes the sensory cortical region for movement-compensated sensory processing
(Bouvier et al.2020,Guitchounts et al.2020,Leinweber et al.2017,Schneider & Mooney 2018,
Schneider et al.2014).

There is generally thought to be a gradient of spatial and temporal specificity in neuromodula-
toryactions,withbroadlyprojectingsystems,suchasthelocuscoeruleus,regulatinglargeregions
of the cerebral cortex and related structures together, and more localized systems, such as basal
forebrain cholinergic pathways, providing for a more spatially selective modulation of neuronal

SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The brain exhibits repeating nonrandom patterns of activities that correlate with, and strongly
influence, behavior. Understanding the states of the brain, their mechanisms of generation, and
howtheyinteractwithsensorimotorandcognitiveprocessingisessentialtoachievingathorough
understanding of neural mechanisms of natural behavior.While progress is being made on both
the human and animal fronts, large gaps remain. Neuroscience investigations into the mouse
brain tend to treat all cortical areas as operating on a common theme, yet regional variations in
cortical function are an important aspect of the human brain. Likewise, while the cellular and
network mechanisms of a few different basic patterns of neuronal activity (e.g., spindle waves,
slow waves) are now roughly known,there are many patterns of activity in the human brain (e.g.,
SCPs, infraslow oscillations) for which cellular- and circuit-level understanding are still in their
infancy. The same is true for neurotransmitter systems that control brain state. While some of
themajorplayershavebeenidentified,wearestillfarfromunderstandingwhatdrivestheactivity
within these modulatory systems and precisely how they interact to control the state of the brain
in a behaviorally appropriate manner. Perhaps one of the most intriguing areas for study in the
near future is the possibility that corticocortical or corticosubcortical glutamatergic/GABAergic
systems rapidly and precisely (in both space and time) control the state of brain activity,bringing
out the rapid transitions that are critical to behavior and cognition in real-life scenarios. Even
though the gaps of knowledge are large, they are narrowing. We now know a great deal more
about neural circuits of state-dependent processing than we did just a decade or two ago. The
continued rapid advances of recording, imaging, and manipulation tools will only speed our
progress toward filling these gaps in knowledge,ultimately resulting in a functional schematic of
brain-state control and its influence on behavior.
