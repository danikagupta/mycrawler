ABSTRACT
The development and implementation of a simple, sensitive and reliable 
assay to measure the formation of interstrand cross-links induced in 
isolated DNA by bifunctional alkylating agents is described. A number of
compounds were evaluated for their ability to induce interstrand cross­
links in DNA including the nitrogen mustard class of alkylating agents, 
se v e ra l s tru c tu ra lly  re la te d  an alo g u es o f the b io re d u c tiv e  
aziridinylbenzoquinone AZQ (diaziquone), and several C 8-linked 
pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimers. The assay involves the reaction of end- 
labeled linear plasmid DNA with cross-linking agents and the subsequent
separation and detection of cross-linked DNA from uncross-linked DNA 
using agarose gel electrophoreses. The technique compares the extent and
rate of cross-link formation of different classes of bifunctional agents and
can be extended to measure the conversion of DNA monoadducts to cross­
lin k s.
In the second part of this study, the nucleotide sequence preferences for 
the formation of interstrand cross-links induced in DNA by nitrogen 
mustard, 2,5-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DZQ) and 3,6-dimethyl DZQ 
(MeDZQ) were examined using synthetic duplex oligonucleotides and 
denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Nitrogen mustard 
was found to preferentially cross-link DNA in a 5 -GNC sequence using a 
panel of oligonucleotides containing a single potential cross-linking site. 
Reaction of DZQ and MeDZQ with DNA duplexes containing several potential 
cross-linking sites resulted in the formation of cross-linked DNAs with 
different electrophoretic mobilities. Analysis of the principal cross-linked 
products by piperidine fragmentation revealed that the preferential site of
cross-linking was altered from a 5'-GNC to a 5'-GC sequence upon reduction 
of DZQ to the hydroquinone form by the enzyme DT-Diaphorase. In 
contrast, the reduced form of MeDZQ was found to preferentially cross-link 
at 5'GNC sites within the same sequence. Additional minor cross-linked 
products were characterised and revealed that unreduced DZQ and reduced 
MeDZQ are both capable of cross-linking across four base pairs in a 5'-GNNC 
sequence.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
The bifunctional alkylating agents constitute a class of antitumour 
compounds that continue to be of central im portance in cancer 
chemotherapy. The search for effective chemical agents in the treatment 
of neoplastic disease has persevered since the landmark discovery 
following World War II that nitrogen mustard was effective in the 
treatment of patients with lymphomas (Gilman & Phillips 1946). The 
development of curative treatments for many of the cancers that afflict 
children and young adults, including acute lym phocytic leukaemia, 
Hodgkins disease, and testicular germ cell tumours, has been the result of 
advances in drug therapy. Such progress has generated considerable 
interest in the development of new drugs and much effort has been 
directed toward understanding the biochemical basis for drug interactions 
as well as to improving the selectivity of drug action against malignant 
cells. Other areas of research have focused on the modification of existing 
clinically active agents with a view to enhancing their antitumour effects 
while minimising unwanted toxic side effects.
The search for synthetic agents as well as naturally occurring compounds 
that are effective in the treatment of cancer has resulted in a multitude of 
different agents that differ greatly with respect to structure and reaction 
mechanism. Such compounds include synthetic chemicals, hormones, 
antimetabolites, antibiotics, and a host of other useful agents that defy easy 
classification. However, alkylating agents remain one of the most effective 
classes of antitumour compounds nearly 50 years after their discovery.

A num ber of alkylating agents including the nitrogen m ustards, 
nitrosoureas, aziridines, and dimethane sulphonates (figure 1.1) have 
proven effective in treating a variety of cancers. A common property

Figure 1.1 Structure of some common alkylating agents
associated with the alkylating agents is their ability to substitute an alkyl 
group, the structure of which may be complex, for a proton in a 
nucleophilic molecule. Although not all clinically useful alkylating agents 
are bifunctional, the presence of two alkylating moieties appears to be 
crucial with respect to the cytotoxic action of this group of compounds. As 
the chemical mechanism for many of the alkylating agents became better 
understood, it was thought that the cytotoxic effects produced by these 
agents were due to the formation of covalent cross-links between biological 
macromolecules. It was later proposed that DNA was a critical target for 
cross-linking by the bifunctional alkylating agents (Goldacre et al., 1949; 
Stacey et al., 1958). The role of DNA in replication and the finding that 
alkylation reactions can occur at DNA bases suggested DNA interstrand
17
cross-linking as a crucial event (Brooks & Lawley, 1960; Brooks & Lawley,
1961). Even though some of the most effective alkylating agents are 
bifunctional and that DNA appears to be an important target for these 
agents, the mechanism(s) by which alkylating agents exert their cytotoxic 
effects is still not fully understood.
1.1. Nitrogen mustards
Mechlorethamine was one of the first non-hormonal agents to exhibit 
significant antineoplastic activity in the clinic and has played an 
im portant historic role in the evolution of chemotherapeutic agents 
(Gilman & Phillips, 1946). Figure 1.2 shows the structures of some of the 
clinically used nitrogen mustard compounds. The precursor of 
mechlorethamine, sulphur mustard, was used as a chemical warfare agent 
during the first World War. Sulphur mustard was known to be an 
extremely potent vesicant causing severe leukopenia, bone marrow aplasia 
and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract in military personnel exposed to 
high concentrations of the gas (Krum bhaar & Krumbhaar, 1919). 
Although its use as chemical warfare agent was never reported, nitrogen 
mustard was also originally developed during the mid 1930's for use on the 
battlefield. The known toxic effects of the mustards inspired Gilman and 
co-workers to test the effects of mechlorethamine in tumour bearing mice. 
Encouraging early results led to the first clinical trials of nitrogen mustard 
in 1942 in a patient with lymphosarcoma (Gilman & Phillips, 1946). With 
the publishing of this paper, it can be argued that the era of modem 
chem otherapy began.

Figure 1.2 Structures of some common nitrogen mustard compounds
Since the discovery of the clinical effectiveness of nitrogen mustard, 
thousands of analogues continue to be synthesised in an effort to improve 
the efficacy of the parent compound. As it became clear that the 2,2'- 
dichlorodiethylamine structure (nor-HN2) was an important feature of the 
nitrogen mustards, synthetic efforts concentrated mainly on replacement 
of the methyl group on nitrogen mustard with almost every feasible
19
constituent. Attempts have been made to synthesise modified mustards in 
the hope that they would preferentially localise in a specific tissue type.
For example, since phenylalanine is a precursor of melanin, it was 
thought that phenylalanine mustard (Melphalan) might be directed to
crucial metabolic sites in melanomas. Using similar reasoning, mustards 
c o n tain in g  p y rim id in es (u rac il m u stard ), p h e n y lb u ty ric  acid
(chlorambucil) and other cellular constituents were attached to nor-HN2 in
an effort to obtain a site directed effect. Reportedly high levels of
phosphoramidases and phosphatases in some tumours prompted the search 
for suitable phosphorylated nitrogen mustard substrates (Gomori, 1948).
The development of cyclophosphamide emerged as a result of such efforts
and continues to be one of the most widely used antitumour agents despite
the fact that the original premise for its synthesis has largely been 
discounted. In contrast to mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide and 
ifosphamide require metabolic activation by mixed function oxygenases to
elicit their antitumour effect (Connors et al., 1974).
In general, the nitrogen mustard alkylating agents are highly reactive 
compounds that are able to form covalent bonds with various nucleophiles 
(Price, 1975). Figure 1.3 shows the proposed mechanism of action for a 
majority of nitrogen mustard compounds. Formation of the aziridinium ion 
intermediate at neutral or alkaline pH occurs upon loss of the chlorine 
atom from one of the chloroethyl side chains. The resulting three 
membered aziridine ring system is highly reactive and capable of forming 
a covalent bond with biological nucleophiles. Although nitrogen mustards 
are capable of reacting with a variety of biological macromolecules 
including the sulfhydryl and amino groups of proteins and other cellular 
constituents (Connors, 1975), the most critical site for attack is thought to

Figure 1.3 Proposed reaction mechanism for nitrogen mustard compounds
be at the guanine-N7 position of DNA. Upon initial attachment of the 
mustard to the guanine-N7 position, the second chloroethyl group has the 
potential to react with other nucleophilic moieties including protein or 
DNA. Reaction of the second group with the opposite strand of DNA leads to 
the formation of a DNA interstrand cross-link while hydrolysis of the 
second arm of the chloroethyl group prevents cross-link formation. Thus 
the sequence of alkylation of DNA can have a number of results and may 
lead to different biological effects. Indeed, the number of nitrogen
21
mustard monoadducts far exceeds the number of cross-links in DNA 
(Hemminki & Ludlum, 1981).
1.2. Aziridines
Interest in the synthesis and evaluation of aziridine compounds grew from 
the consistent observation that the most effective nitrogen mustards 
possessed two chloroethyl groups which were able to cyclise to form the 
highly reactive aziridinium ion intermediate. Figure 1.4 shows some of the 
bifunctional aziridines that have been effective against some human 
tumours. Triethylenemelamine (TEM), originally described as a cross- 
linking agent for wool, showed activity in animal tumours (Burchenal et 
al., 1950; Lewis & Crossley, 1950) and later in human cancers. A particular 
advantage with TEM was that it could be orally administered with little or 
no nausea. Subsequently, TEPA (Hendry et al., 1951) and its thio derivative 
(Baterman, 1955; Ultmann et al., 1957) preferred for its activity against 
carcinoma of the breast and ovary , were used extensively in the clinic. 
However, these aziridine compounds have found limited use today due to 
lack of therapeutic advantage over the more frequently used nitrogen 
mustard derivatives.
One group of compounds, the mitomycins, are unique in that they are the 
only known naturally occurring compounds to contain an aziridine ring. 
Mitomycin C (figure 1.4), first isolated in 1958 (Wakaki et al., 1958), was of 
particular interest and has been found to be active against a wide variety of 
solid tumours. A key feature of mitomycin C is the presence of the quinone 
moiety as part of its structure. Studies on the mechanism of action of 
mitomycin C have implicated DNA as the relevant cellular target. However, 
mitomycin C in its oxidised form is inactive and requires enzymatic

et al., 1979), xanthine oxidase (Pan et al., 1984), or DT-Diaphorase (Fracasso 
et al., 1983; Siegel et al., 1990b) to produce more active cytotoxic species.
23
Mitomycin C is capable of undergoing both one and two electron reduction 
to generate more active metabolites. One electron reduction can lead to the 
formation of several active metabolites such as the radical semiquinone 
(Bachur et al., 1978; Kalyanaraman et al., 1980) which may interact with 
molecular oxygen to produce superoxide radicals or other highly reactive 
oxygen species (Lown & Chen, 1981; Tomasz, 1976). Such highly reactive 
metabolites have the potential to interact with DNA to produce single strand 
breaks. In contrast, two electron reduction of mitomycin C to the 
dihydroquinone form can lead to a species capable of alkylating and cross- 
linking DNA (Siegel et al., 1990b).
The requirement for mitomycin C to be reduced by cellular enzymes to 
elicit its antitumour effect has led to the search for other bioreductive 
alkylating agents in the hope that tumours with high levels of reductive 
enzymes may be sensitive to their cytotoxic effects. In addition, the 
quinone containing drugs may be more selective to hypoxic cells since 
reduced levels of oxygen in poorly vascularised tumours favour the
reduced and hence more reactive form of these compounds. As a result the 
aziridinyl benzoquinones (figure 1.4) have recently received attention as 
possible antitumour agents. Like mitomycin C, these compounds also have
the potential to undergo bioreductive activation via the one or two electron 
reduction pathway to generate more reactive metabolites (Begleiter &
Leith, 1990; Gutierrez, 1989; Powis, 1989). Formation of DNA cross-links 
induced by enzymatically activated aziridinylbenzoquinones is thought to 
play an im portant role in the cytotoxic activity of these agents 
(Dzielendziak et al., 1990; Gibson et al., 1992; Pacheco et al., 1991; Siegel et 
al., 1990a). Enzymatic or chemical reduction of the non aromatic quinones 
to the aromatic hydroquinone alters the electron distribution and 
facilitates aziridine ring opening. Protonation of the aziridine ring also
24
catalyses ring opening and thus an increase in DNA cross-linking has been 
observed with both the quinone and hydroquinone at acidic pH (Hartley et 
al., 1991a; Lee et al., 1992).
1.3. Nitrosoureas
The development of the nitrosoureas emerged from a nation-wide research 
program set up by the US government in the mid-1950's to evaluate and test 
chemical compounds in animal tumour models for possible use against 
human cancers (Endicott, 1965). Subsequently, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N- 
nitrosoguanine (MNNG), formerly used in the preparation of diazomethane, 
a powerful methylating agent, was found to exhibit a degree of activity 
against L1210 leukaemia in mice (Montgomery, 1981). Promising results 
led to the development of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) which later 
proved to be effective in mice with intracerebrally implanted leukaemia. 
Although the mechanism of action was not fully understood, evidence that 
MNU was capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier led to a synthetic 
program at the Southern Research institute to develop related nitroso
compounds in an effort to improve the clinical effectiveness of this group 
of agents (Montgomery, 1981).
F urther study indicated the chloroethyl d erivatives such as 
chloroethylnitrosourea and bischloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) possessed 
greater antitumour activity than MNU and other similar alkyl derivatives.
As a result and because of its lipophilic properties, BCNU was the first
compound of its type to undergo clinical trials and has since shown activity
against brain tumours and other cancers (DeVita et al., 1965; Nissen et al.,
1979). Because of the beneficial activity of BCNU, other chloroethyl 
derivatives such as cyclohexylchloroethylnitrosourea (CCNU) and methyl
25
CCNU have emerged as effective antitumour agents (figure 1.5). Because 
these agents shared cross-resistance with compounds such as the nitrogen 
mustards it was thought that they were acting as alkylating agents. Several

studies have confirmed this hypothesis and the chemical mechanism of 
alkylation has been established (figure 1.6). The spontaneous 
decom position of the drug at physiological pH produces the 2- 
chloroethyldiazene hydroxide and the isocyanate moieties. The breakdown 
of the 2-chloroethyldiazene hydroxide species then generates the 
chloroethyl carbonium ion which is capable of alkylating nucleophilic 
sites within the cell. Largely due to the work of Ludlum and Kohn it was 
established that the chloroethyl carbonium ion had the potential to

1.4. C hem istry
The reaction mechanisms of the bifunctional alkylating agents can 
ordinarily be classified as either SnI (nucleophilic substitution, first order) 
or Sn2 (nucleophilic substitution, second order). S ^ l reactions involve the 
initial formation of a reactive intermediate followed by the rapid reaction 
with a nucleophilic substrate to form an alkylated product (figure 1.7). The

rate of this reaction depends only upon the initial concentration of the 
alkylating agent and is largely independent of the concentration of the 
substrate. Formation of the reactive intermediate is therefore the rate 
limiting step and the reaction follows first order kinetics. The Sn2 
reactions are characterised by the formation of an intermediate complex in
28
which the rate of reaction depends on the initial concentrations of both 
the alkylating agent and nucleophilic substrate and thus follows second 
order kinetics. The reaction of chemotherapeutic alkylating agents can 
follow either S|y 1  reaction kinetics such as the nitrogen mustards and 
nitrosoureas or exhibit S^2 characteristics such as busulfan.
1.5. Sites of Alkylation
Although bifunctional alkylating agents are known to react with a variety 
of nucleophilic sites within cellular biological macromolecules (Skipper et 
al., 1951), it has been difficult to ascertain which sites within the cell have 
been critical with respect to the cytotoxic actions of these agents. 
Cytotoxicity might be associated with such factors as damage to the plasma 
membrane, inactivation of crucial enzymes, depletion of amino acid or 
nucleotide precursors, or a combination of these deleterious effects.
Although these considerations cannot be totally discounted, the fact that 
alkylating agents are frequently active at extremely low concentrations 
appears to implicate the inactivation of macromolecules such as DNA. The 
demonstration that bifunctional agents are capable of inhibiting DNA 
synthesis, seems to support such ideas (Drysdale et al., 1958; Wheeler, 1962).
In general, the preponderance of evidence appears to support the 
contention that inactivation of the DNA template by alkylating agents is
principally responsible for inhibition of synthesis rather than damage to
polymerase enzymes (Roberts et al., 1971; Ruddon & Johnson, 1968;
Wheeler & Alexander, 1969).
In light of these observations, attention turned to the sites within DNA 
which are modified by alkylating agents. The DNA molecule presents a
number of nucleophilic sites which have the potential to react with
29
alkylating agents. Several studies have shown that the oxygen atoms of the 
sugar phosphate group of DNA have the potential to undergo alkylation 
reactions (Bannon & Verly, 1972; Lawley, 1973; Singer & Fraenkel-Courat,
1975). Even though the biological significance of phosphate alkylation is 
not well understood, it is not thought to make a substantial contribution to 
cytotoxicity due to the slow rate of phosphotriester hydrolysis (Verly,
1974). The heterocyclic purine and pyrimidine bases of DNA present 
additional sites for alkylation and a number of studies have shown that 
most nitrogen and oxygen atoms are susceptible to varying degrees of 
alkylation by both monofunctional and bifunctional compounds (Singer,
1976). Alkylation of base sites, in particular the 06 position of guanine, is 
thought to play a role in carcinogenesis (Loveless, 1969; Weinstein et al.,
1976). Thus, in addition to their cytotoxic activity, the alkylating agents are 
potential carcinogens and mutagens. Studies of the relative electrostatic 
potential of purine bases reveal that the most electronegative sites in DNA 
are located at the N7 and 06 position of guanine and the adenine N3 and N1 
positions (Pullman & Pullman, 1981). It is clear however, that the guanine 
N7 position is the most electronegative position in DNA and therefore the 
site which is most readily alkylated. Indeed, reaction of a monofunctional 
nitrogen mustard with individual nucleosides in solution produced a 
distribution of adducts between the four bases with the guanine-N7 adduct 
as the major product, followed by the N1 of adenine, N3 of cytosine, and N3 
of thymidine (Price et al., 1968). In contrast, only the guanine-N7 adduct 
was produced in any appreciable quantities upon brief incubation of the 
agent with intact DNA. In similar studies, hydrolysis of DNA treated with 
nitrogen mustard and busulfan also yielded primarily guanine-N7 adducts 
upon HPLC analysis (Brooks & Lawley, 1961; Mehta et al., 1980; Tong &
Ludlum, 1980).

Figure 1.8 Modified guanine products isolated from DNA treated with 
chloroethylnitrosoureas
In contrast to the mustard compounds, a complex series of adducts has 
been iso lated  upon h y d ro ly sis o f DNA tre a te d  w ith the
chloroethylnitrosoureas (Ludlum, 1990). For example, figure 1.8 shows
31
some of the guanine adducts generated from chloroethylnitrosourea 
treatment of DNA. In some instances, these adducts may be due to direct 
attack of the chloroethyl carbonium ion, or rearrangement of alkyl groups
initially attached at other base positions. Formation of additional 
heterocyclic rings by the alkyl group between two atoms on the same base 
may account for some of the adducts. Other adducts are believed to
originate from DNA cross-linked by the alkyl group. Interestingly, unlike 
the nitrogen mustards, the distribution of specific DNA base adducts by the 
chloroethylnitrosoureas has been shown to be compound specific (Tong et 
al., 1982). A lthough the 7-chloroethylguanine and the 7- 
hyroxyethylguanine DNA adducts have been shown to comprise a majority 
of the substituted base products, the guanine 06 alkyl lesion is believed to 
be the most important in the formation of DNA cross-links.
1.6. DNA Cross-Linking
The initial event in the formation of a DNA interstrand cross-link involves 
the non covalent binding of the drug with double stranded DNA. This 
interaction may be influenced by a number of factors including the ability 
of the drug to intercalate into the bases of DNA, hydrogen bond formation 
and the distribution of nucleophilic centres along the DNA molecule as well 
as the structure of the DNA reactive species. The covalent modification of a 
specific site on one strand of the DNA by the alkylating agent to form a 
monoadduct is the first step in cross-link formation. Depending on the 
nature of the reactive species, the second reactive part of the molecule may 
be hydrolysed and prevent cross-link formation. The second reaction may 
also take place on the same strand to produce a DNA in trastrand cross-link. 
Reaction with the opposite DNA strand results in the production of the DNA 
interstrand cross-link.
32
Based on the finding that the N-7 position of guanine was the primary site 
of attachment for many of the nitrogen mustards, it was suggested that 
these compounds exert their cytotoxic effect by forming DNA interstrand 
cross-links (Brooks & Lawley, 1961; Brooks & Lawley, 1963). Loveless and 
Ross showed that the bifunctional alkylating agents were much more 
effective antitum our agents than their corresponding monofunctional 
derivatives (Loveless & Ross, 1950). In addition, the antitumour activity of 
these agents was not significantly enhanced upon increasing the number 
of alkylating units beyond two. Although a number of cellular constituents 
can serve as substrates for chemical attack by alkylating agents (Connors,
1975), detailed studies of the effect of nitrogen mustards on the various 
biochemical functions of bacterial cell-free systems have shown the most 
critical cellular processes were those involved with the ability of DNA to act 
as a template for DNA and RNA synthesis (Johnson & Ruddon, 1967; Ruddon 
& Johnson, 1968). Early studies of the effects of nitrogen mustard on 
cultured mouse fibroblasts showed inhibition of DNA synthesis was much 
more pronounced than that of RNA or protein synthesis (Booth et al., 1964; 
Brewer et al., 1961).
Additional evidence for the inhibition of DNA replication by cross-linking 
agents has been reported for other agents. In one study, low 
concentrations of free mitomycin C did not inhibit DNA polymerase systems 
in-vitro while the addition of a small amount of cross-linked DNA decreased 
its activity (Tanaka & Yoshida, 1981). Inhibition of polymerase activity was 
reversed by increasing the concentration of tem plate prim er while 
increased concentrations of dideoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTP) 
had no effect. It has been demonstrated that treatment of cells in culture 
with psoralen plus UV light arrested cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell
33
cycle (Varga et al., 1982). In contrast, the monofunctional alkylating 
agent angelicin had no such effect. Thus the inhibition of DNA replication 
and synthesis is a likely mechanism by which cross-linking agents are
thought to exert their cytotoxic effect.
Other early studies implicating DNA interstrand cross-linking as an
important cytotoxic lesion were based on the observation by Loveless and 
Stock that T2 phage was inactivated a short time after treatment with either 
nitrogen mustard or di(2:3-epoxypropyl)ether (Loveless & Stock, 1959a; 
Loveless & Stock, 1959b). Delayed inactivation of the phage was thought to 
be due to the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links from monoadducts. 
Continued inactivation of the phage was shown to be prevented upon 
subsequent treatment with thiosulphate which inactivates any unreacted 
monoadducts and precludes cross-link formation. Although it was
proposed that inactivation of T2 phage might be attributed to formation of 
cross-links between the DNA and capsid protein (Loveless & Stock, 1959c),
it was later demonstrated that bacteriophage T7 were much more sensitive 
to inactivation by the bifunctional agent (di-(2-chloroethyl)sulphide) than 
its corresponding monofunctional derivative (Lawley et al., 1969). In the
latter study it was found that the m onofunctional agent required 
approximately 40 fold more alkylations to inactivate the average T2
bacteriophage than its bifunctional counterpart.
Although physical techniques such as sedimentation velocity techniques 
and thermal dénaturation methods have provided direct evidence for the
presence of DNA interstrand cross-links induced in isolated and cellular 
DNA (Brooks & Lawley, 1963; Geiduschek, 1961), it was not until the
development of the alkaline elution technique that DNA damage could be 
evaluated at therapeutic levels of alkylation (Kohn et al., 1976). Using this
34
technique it was possible to begin to assess the role of DNA cross-linking in 
the cytotoxic action of a variety of bifunctional alkylating agents at 
pharmacologically relevant concentrations (Ewig & Kohn, 1977; Ross et al.,
1978). Important evidence for the role of DNA interstrand cross-linking 
has emerged from alkaline elution studies involving cell lines with 
differential levels of DNA repair enzymes. Day and co-workers were able to 
demonstrate that some human tumour cell lines (designated Mer-) were
deficient in the ability to remove alkylations from the 06 position of 
guanine while other cell lines (termed Mer+) were proficient in this repair 
process (Day et al., 1980). Since the initial step in the formation of DNA 
cross-links induced by chloroethylnitrosoureas was proposed to be an 
addition of the chloroethyl group to the 06 position of guanine with the 
subsequent conversion to a cross-link over a period of hours (Kohn, 1977), 
it was hypothesised that the repair enzyme, guanine 06 alkyltransferase 
(GOAT), would also remove chloroethyl alkylations during this delay period
to prevent cross-link formation (Erickson et al., 1980a). It was later 
demonstrated that the Mer+ phenotype was indeed resistant to the cytotoxic 
effects of the chloroethylnitrosoureas and exhibited far fewer DNA cross­
links than did the Mer- cell strain despite the fact that both cell strains 
showed equivalent levels of drug uptake and protein cross-links (Erickson 
et al., 1980b). In addition, DNA cross-linking in Mer- cell lines has been 
associated with cytotoxicity in other studies (Scudiero et al., 1984).
Pretreatment of M er-»- cell lines with MNNG, conditions which deplete
intracellular GOAT levels, has resulted in an increase in the level of DNA 
interstrand cross-links following exposure to chloroethylnitrosoureas 
(Zlotogorski & Erickson, 1983; Zlotogorski & Erickson, 1984). Furthermore, 
transfection of DNA from a chloroethylnitrosourea resistant tumour cell 
line (Mer-i-) to a sensitive tumour cell line (Mer-) results in a tumour cell
35
line resistant to chloroethylnitrosourea with increased GOAT levels and 
decreased levels of DNA cross-links (Yarosh et al., 1986).
The production and removal of DNA cross-links induced by nitrogen 
mustard and melphalan has been suggested to be a measure of sensitivity in 
cell lines (Hansson et al., 1987; Zwelling et al., 1981). It has recently been 
shown that a correlation between the kinetics of DNA cross-link formation
and loss of colony forming ability existed for a number of nitrogen mustard 
compounds (O'Connor & Kohn, 1990). In studies with other agents, the in- 
vitro cytotoxicity of a series ^ dimethane sulphonates has been attributed to 
their ability to form DNA cross-links but not protein cross-links (Bedford & 
Fox, 1983).
Although it became clear that bifunctional attack was an important aspect 
associated with cytotoxicity, the role of intrastrand cross-linking remains
unresolved. This problem was partially addressed in a study relating 
platinum induced damage in X DNA phage to loss of transfecting activity in 
E. coli (Filipski et al., 1980). It was found that both cis- and trans-platinum 
were capable of generating cross-links in the purified DNA. Drug 
reactions were carried out in such a way as to ensure any remaining
reactive monoalkylations were inactivated (Filipski et al., 1979). For the 
case of trans-platinum , only uncross-linked DNA molecules retained 
transfective properties. Although DNA cross-linked by cis-platinum was 
also capable of inhibiting transfection, a significant proportion of 
uncross-linked DNA treated with this agent inactivated X DNA phage. These 
findings suggested that DNA cross-linked by both cis- and trans-platinum 
were capable of inactivating viral DNA but only cisplatin treated DNA 
contained non cross-linked adducts capable of inhibiting transfection .
Such lesions are likely to be intrastrand cross-links.
36
1.7. In-Vitro DNA Cross-Linking Assays
Structure function relationships have indicated that bifunctionality and 
therefore DNA interstrand cross-linking play a critical role in the 
cytotoxic action of bifunctional alkylating agents. U nfortunately, 
alkylation reactions take place at a number of sites within the cell of which 
only a small percentage are of the crucial cross-linking type. The 
challenge is therefore to detect and identify DNA lesions, such as 
interstrand cross-links, induced by bifunctional alkylating agents in 
order to assess their role in cytotoxicity.
Several methods have been described for the measurement of DNA 
interstrand cross-linking both in isolated DNA and in cells. Detection of 
interstrand cross-links in cells treated with bifunctional agents has been 
accomplished using sedimentation velocity and denaturation-renaturation 
studies. More recently, the technique of alkaline elution has been 
instrumental in the analysis of cross-link damage induced in cellular DNA. 
A number of techniques have been applied to the analysis of cross-links 
formed in isolated DNA. The action of various enzymes including 
endonucleases, exonucleases and some polymerases is inhibited by DNA 
containing an interstrand cross-link. Under appropriate conditions, the 
presence of a cross-link between the complementary strands of a DNA 
fragment will cause that fragment to migrate with an increased apparent 
molecular weight through polyacrylamide or agarose gels. Cross-linked 
DNA can also be analysed by various chromatographic methods and 
detected by an increase in the retention time compared to uncross-linked 
DNA.
37
Many cross-linking assays are based on the principle that treatment of 
double stranded DNA with heat or alkali under appropriate conditions will 
denature the DNA. Raising the temperature of double stranded DNA 
fragments in solution to a critical point disrupts the hydrogen bonding 
between bases and will denature the DNA into its component single strands.
Rapid cooling of the denatured DNA will prevent the strands from re­
associating. Alternatively, double stranded DNA is denatured under 
alkaline conditions at sufficiently high pH values (pH>12). The time 
required for the complete separation of DNA strands depends on a number 
of factors including the length of the fragment, temperature, and ionic 
s tre n g th .
The presence of an interstrand cross-link in a double stranded DNA 
fragment will prevent the complete separation of the strands under either 
heat or alkaline denaturing conditions. The interstrand cross-link in DNA 
serves as a point for the re-association of the denatured strands upon 
cooling or neutralisation while uncross-linked molecules remain separated 
(Jolley & Ormerod, 1973). The extent of cross-linking in a population of 
DNA fragments can thus be evaluated by subjecting the sample to the 
denaturing/renaturing process and separating the fragm ents using a 
variety of methods.
1.7.1. Sedim entation
The analysis of cross-linking and repair in cellular DNA has been 
demonstrated by both alkaline sucrose sedimentation and isopicnic caesium 
chloride centrifugation methods(Ball & Roberts, 1971/72; Cole, 1973; Cole et 
al., 1976; Fujiwara & Tatsumi, 1977; Iyer & Szybalski, 1964; Jolley & 
Ormerod, 1973; Pera et al., 1981). These techniques usually involve
38
labeling cells in culture prior to treatment with the cross-linking agent.
With the alkaline sucrose method, cells are harvested, lysed and subjected 
to alkaline denaturing conditions. The lysate is then layered onto an 
alkaline sucrose gradient (ca. pH 12.5), and centrifuged under appropriate 
conditions. Estimation of the molecular weight can be obtained by 
incorporating DNAs of known size as internal standards. After 
centrifugation, the sample is eluted from the bottom of the centrifuge tube 
and collected as a number of fractions. The radioactivity in each fraction is 
counted to obtain a sedimentation profile. A plot of radioactivity versus
fraction number will show DNA from drug treated cells sedimenting more
rapidly through the gradient (i.e.. early fraction numbers) than the DNA 
from untreated cells. Thus a qualitative measure of the extent of cross- 
linking can be obtained from the resulting sedimentation profiles. A 
recent study has applied alkaline sucrose sedimentation to the analysis of 
cross-link formation and repair in actively transcribed gene sequences by 
hybridising specific probes to eluate fractions blotted to nitrocellulose
filters (Islas et al., 1991). The process of analysing DNA repair with this 
method is somewhat complicated by the need to separate out drug treated
parental DNA from newly synthesised DNA using bromodeoxyuridine 
in c o rp o ra tio n .
M oreover, the rate at which DNA migrates through alkaline sucrose 
gradients depends on a number of factors including centrifugation time 
and speed, DNA fragment size, and the number of cross-links per fragment. 
Quantitative analysis of DNA cross-linking using this method is complicated 
by the fact that DNA fragments containing many cross-links will sediment 
more rapidly through the gradient and can lead to an overestimation of 
cross-linking. To avoid such difficulties the DNA must be sheared by vortex 
to obtain DNA containing roughly one cross-link per fragment. Other
39
methods utilise x-rays to induce random breaks in the treated DNA. An
underestimation of the extent of DNA cross-linking can occur if the cross­
link is converted to strand breaks during the alkaline denaturing step.
Precise quantitation of cross-linked DNA also becomes cumbersome from 
the analysis gradient profiles,
1.7.2. Alkaline Elution
The technique of alkaline elution was originally developed by Kohn and 
co-workers for analysing cellular DNA damage in mammalian cells (Kohn, 
1979; Kohn, 1981; Kohn et al., 1976; Kohn et al., 1981). Essentially, cells are 
layered onto a membrane filter and lysed with a detergent solution. Cell 
lysates are allowed to flow through the filter leaving the DNA largely intact 
on the filter. The DNA is then slowly pumped through the filter with a 
high pH solution (ca. pH 12) which separates the DNA into single strands. 
The majority of denatured untreated DNA remains on the filter under these 
conditions due to the extreme length of the strands. However, if the DNA is 
fragmented into smaller pieces by exposure to x-rays, the DNA will elute 
through the filter at an increased rate and is proportional to the x-ray dose. 
Strand breaks induced by x-rays are random in nature and the DNA will 
elute from the filter according to first order kinetics. The level of 
sensitivity is high enough to measure one break per 10^ daltons.
In order to assess the level of DNA interstrand cross-linkS induced in the 
cell it is necessary to induce a defined level of random strand breaks with
x-ray a f t e r  treatment with the drug of interest. This allows the DNA 
from untreated cells to elute at a defined rate. Production of cross-links in 
the DNA fragments of treated cells will diminish the rate at which the 
irradiated DNA will elute from the filter. This effect is due to the increase
40
in apparent fragment size imparted by the cross-link between the strands 
of DNA. The extent of cross-linking can be determined by measuring the 
difference in the treated and untreated elution profiles.
The technique of alkaline elution is arguably one of the best methods for 
evaluating damage, particularly cross-linking, induced in mammalian 
cells by DNA reactive agents at pharmacologically meaningful dosages. It 
has the added advantage of measuring other types of DNA damage including 
DNA protein cross-links, DNA double and single strand breaks as well as 
alkali labile lesions. Although the technique is extremely sensitive, the 
measurement of DNA cross-links is nevertheless indirect and depends on 
the decreased rate of elution of radiolabelled DNAs. Any limitations might 
include expensive and specialised equipment and the time necessary to set 
up and execute the experiments.
1.7.3. Ethidium Bromide Fluorescence Assay
Ethidium bromide is a fluorescent dye containing a planar structure which 
is capable of intercalating into the stacked bases of DNA (Maniatis et al.,
1982). Dye which is bound to DNA displays an increased fluorescent yield 
compared to dye in free solution. Radiant energy absorbed by DNA at 254 
nm is transmitted to the bound dye and subsequently re-emitted at 590 nm 
in the red-orange region of the visible spectrum. Ethidium bromide can be 
used to detect both single- and double stranded DNA. However, the 
fluorescent yield of ethidium bromide bound to double stranded DNA is 
much greater than that for single stranded DNA. This differential 
fluorescence can be exploited to measure cross-links induced in DNA.
41
The use of ethidium bromide to detect cross-links induced in DNA by 
mitomycin C was demonstrated by Lown et. al. (1976). Essentially, a small 
aliquot of drug treated DNA is added to a solution containing ethidium 
bromide. After an equilibration period, during which the ethidium 
bromide intercalates into the DNA, a fluorescence measurement is taken.
The sample is then subjected to thermal dénaturation followed by rapid 
cooling. Under these conditions, DNA fragments containing a cross-link 
will rehature to become double stranded while uncross-linked fragments 
remain single stranded. Following thermal treatment and renaturation, 
ethidium bromide will only incorporate into DNA fragments containing an 
interstrand cross-link. The extent of cross-linking can be estimated by 
calculating the ratio of fluorescence values before and after thermal 
tre a tm e n t.
Using this approach, it was demonstrated that DNA cross-links induced by 
mitomycin C increased with time and were. pH dependent. However, at high 
concentrations of mitomycin C, a decrease in the level of fluorescence was 
reported (Lown et al., 1976). The decrease in fluorescence was attributed to 
a decrease in the number of intercalation sites available to ethidium 
bromide at high levels of alkylation.
1.7.4. C hrom atography
A number of investigators have reported the preparation and analysis of 
cross-linked DNAs using hydroxyl apatite, sephadex and HPLC 
chromatographic methods (Bemges & Holler, 1991; Borowy-Borowski et al.,
1990a; Borowy-Borowski et al., 1990b; Norman et al., 1990; Tomasz et al.,
1974; Tong & Ludlum, 1980). A method for the separation of mitomycin C 
cross-linked DNA has been described using hydroxyl apatite
42
chromatography (Fujiwara, 1983). One approach involves radiolabeling of
cells in culture with either H or C thymidine, followed by chasing the
label into high molecular weight DNA in label-free medium. The DNA is 
then purified from cells and subjected to denaturing-renaturing 
conditions. Typically 10 p . g of DNA is loaded onto a column packed with 1  ml 
of hydroxylapatite equilibrated with phosphate buffer (0.1-0.5M), pH 6.8
(Fujiwara, 1983). The DNA is then pumped through the column at room
tem perature with a linear phosphate buffer gradient (0.05-0.4M ). 
Denatured single stranded DNA elutes first followed by cross-linked DNA. 
Fractions can then be counted directly by scintillation counting or as TCA
insoluble radioactivity.
Preparation of oligonucleotides cross-linked by m itomycin C and 
characterisation of the resulting base modifications has recently been 
reported using sephadex chromatography (Borowy-Borowski et al., 1990a) 
and HPLC methods (Borowy-Borowski et al., 1990b). Preparation of 
mitomycin C cross-linked oligomers with yields as high as 50% have been 
reported. Other studies have used chromatographic methods in the 
preparation of short DNA duplexes for characterisation by NMR (Norman
et. al., 1990). Since isolation of the cross-linked oligomer product using
sephadex chromatography often requires a second step of purification it is
generally more suitable to the preparative stage of analysis and not 
applicable to the detailed time course studies involving the quantitative 
determination of the extent of cross-linking.
1.7.5. S i Nuclease
81 nuclease is an enzyme which degrades single stranded DNA while 
leaving double stranded DNA intact. Untreated DNA which has been
43
subjected to a denaturing-renaturing process will be single stranded and 
thus becomes susceptible to degradation by the enzyme. However, the 
presence of a covalent cross-link between the complementary strands of 
DNA permits the re-association of the two strands to the double stranded 
form. Hence, cross-linked DNA will be resistant to the action of the 
enzyme. The preference of SI nuclease for digestion of single stranded 
DNA has previously been used to measure the extent of DNA cross-linking 
in mammalian cells (Boyer et al., 1988). The DNA of cells were radiolabeled 
in culture prior to treatment with a cross-linking agent. The cells were 
then exposed to x-rays to create DNA fragments of a defined size and then 
extensively digested with 81 nuclease. Precipitation of the undigested DNA 
followed by scintillation counting of the insoluble fraction provides a 
measure of the extent of cross-linking.
1.7.6. Gel Based Assays
The extent of cross-linking in a population of DNA fragments can be 
evaluated by subjecting the sample to the denaturing/renaturing process 
and separating the fragments using agarose gel electrophoresis. Under 
these conditions, native undenatured and cross-linked denatured DNA will 
migrate with diminished mobility in an agarose gel compared to uncross­
linked denatured DNA. Electrophoresis of a drug treated sample of 
homogenous DNA fragm ents will produce two bands of different 
electrophoretic mobility within the gel. Quantitation of DNA cross-linking 
can therefore be determined by measuring the amount of DNA migrating as 
double stranded.
The evaluation of cross-linking in defined human genomic DNA sequences 
has been demonstrated utilising the differential migration of cross-linked
44
and uncross-linked DNA fragments in agarose gels (Vos & Hanawalt, 1987).
DNA from cells treated with a cross-linking agent is isolated and digested 
with an appropriate restriction enzyme. Fragments are then applied to an 
alkaline agarose gel in either the native or denatured form. After 
electrophoresis the DNA is transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and probed 
for the sequence of interest. The signal from native (double stranded) DNA 
fragments from untreated cells appears as a single band on the 
autoradiograph. Similarly, the signal from denatured (single stranded)
DNA from untreated cells also appears as a single band but migrates with an 
increased mobility through the gel compared to the native DNA fragment.
If a proportion of the DNA fragments containing the gene of interest is 
cross-linked, then two bands appear on the autoradiograph. Those 
fragments containing DNA-DNA cross-links will migrate as double stranded 
through the gel while the uncross-linked fragments remain denatured and 
migrate as single stranded.
Using this approach it was possible to detect cross-links and cross-linkable 
monoadducts induced in the actively transcribed dihydrofolate reductase 
gene (DHFR) in cultured human cells. It was demonstrated that 80% of 
cross-links induced by 4’-hydroxym ethyl-4,5',8-trim ethylpsoralen (HMT) 
and UV light in the DHFR gene were removed after 24 hours (Vos & 
Hanawalt, 1987). Extension of the method to measure the conversion of 
monoadducts to cross-links required the separation of newly synthesised 
daughter DNA from parental DNA in order to assess damage to the DHFR 
gene prior to replication.
In a similar study, heterogeneity of damage induced in specific genomic 
regions was reported for nitrogen mustard and dim ethyl sulphate 
(Wassermann et al., 1990). DNA from treated cells is extracted, restricted
45
and the parental DNA purified. Strand breaks are created at sites of N- 
alkylpurine damage (presumably cross-links and monoadducts) by heating 
the DNA at neutral pH and subsequently treating with alkali. DNA 
fragments are then separated in alkaline agarose gels and transferred to
nylon support membranes. Radioactive probes are then hybridised to
specific regions of various genes to measure the extent damage and repair. 
Nitrogen mustard damage in actively transcribed genes was found to be
preferentially repaired compared to transcriptionally silent genes in CHO 
cells. Interestingly, no such differential repair between active and 
inactive genes was observed after damage induced by dimethyl sulphate.
Similar patterns of heterogeneous repair of DNA cross-linking damage 
have been demonstrated for nitrogen mustard in specific gene sequences 
(Futscher & Erickson, 1990).
Other studies have focused on the ability of DNA interstrand cross-links to 
alter the mobility of non-cellular restriction fragments of plasmid DNAs in 
agarose gels. One such study has reported that the electrophoretic mobility
of Hae III <j)X174 DNA fragments is reduced upon reaction with HMT and UV
light both in neutral and alkaline agarose gels (Kohn, 1979). However,
only slight shifts in mobility were detected for fragments in neutral gels 
even at very high drug concentrations. More pronounced shifts occurred 
under alk alin e electro p h o resis co n ditions although, som ew hat 
surprisingly, the shift in mobility for low concentrations of HMT was 
much greater than for high concentrations. Several years later this 
technique was used to compare the efficiency of cross-linking for a series
of structurally similar CC-1065 dimers (Mitchell et al., 1989). Although the
effect of DNA cross-linking can be detected by band shifting, there is no 
physical separation of cross-linked and uncross-linked DNA in the gel and
46
detection by ethidium bromide staining requires a relatively large amount 
of DNA per sample.
1.7.7. Summary
Several techniques are currently available for the measurement of DNA 
interstrand cross-linking both in cells and in isolated DNA. However, many 
of these techniques are time consuming and often require large amounts of 
DNA or drug. In addition, a number of these methods suffer from the lack 
of sensitivity and are not generally applicable to detailed time course
studies.
1.8. Sequence Specificities of Alkylating Agents
Until recently alkylating agents have been discounted as being poorly 
sequence selective mainly due to the majority of studies focusing primarily 
on DNA base adduct formation requiring high concentrations of drug to 
permit detection. Only within the past fifteen years or so have techniques 
become available for the direct analysis of the sequence specificity of 
bifunctional alkylating agents. The choice of method for detecting DNA 
adducts depends to a large degree on the type of adduct produced by the
agent of interest. For example, the nitrogen mustards react primarily at
the N7 position A  guanine in the major groove while mitomycin C has been
shown to covalently bind with the exocyclic amino group of guanine in the 
minor groove (figure 1.9). The sequence selectivity of alkylating agents 
which react with either the guanine-N7 or adenine-N3 positions on DNA 
can be determined by converting these adducts to strand breaks using 
adaptations of the chemical sequencing reactions described by Max am and 
Gilbert (Maxam & Gilbert, 1977; Maxam & Gilbert, 1980) . Alternatively, the

use of DNA polymerase reactions or nuclease enzymes have been used to 
detect lesions which cannot easily be converted to DNA strand breaks. In 
addition, DNA footprinting methods have been used for those agents which 
do not form covalent complexes with DNA.
1.8.1. M onoalkylation Specificity
The initial reaction of bifunctional alkylating agents with DNA begins with 
the covalent modification of one strand of the DNA duplex to form a DNA 
monoadduct. Depending on the type of adduct, the site at which these 
agents covalently modify DNA bases can be detected using a number of 
strateg ies.
1.8.1.1. Chemical Cleavage
Several compounds have been evaluated for their ability to alkylate 
guanines in a sequence selective manner using a modification of the 
guanine - specific chemical cleavage reaction described by Maxam and
Gilbert (figure 1.10). The guanine specific sequencing reaction involves
treating singly end - labeled DNA with dimethylsulphate (DMS), cleaving the 
modified residues with piperidine at elevated temperature and separating 
the cleavage products using denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(PAGE). This technique takes advantage of the fact that DMS methylates 
DNA primarily at guanine-N7 positions and to a lesser extent at adenine-N3 
positions. Substitution of a methyl group for the hydrogen atom at the
guanine-N7 position creates a positive charge shared by the N7, C8, and N9
atoms on the purine ring. Under alkaline conditions, the bond between C8 
and N9 is broken on reaction of a hydroxyl ion with the C8 atom. Thermal 
treatment with piperidine then displaces the ring opened 7-methyl-

guanine and catalyses the f  - elimination of both phosphates from the DNA. 
Methylated adenines are stable under these reaction conditions and does 
not lead to DNA strand cleavage. The position of guanine residues in a 
given DNA sequence can be determined by adjusting the conditions of the 
méthylation reaction so that approximately one guanine residue per DNA 
fragment is alkylated. Following piperidine treatment, a distribution of 
fragments of different length are generated from cleavage of the fragment 
wherever there was a guanine.
The sequence preferences for those compounds which react predominantly 
at the N7 position of guanine in the major groove can be evaluated by 
substituting an alkylating agent for DMS in the guanine specific 
sequencing reaction provided the DNA sequence is known and the 
concentration of the drug is adjusted to maintain roughly one alkylation 
per fragment (figure 1.11). This modification of the chemical cleavage 
sequencing reaction was first adapted to the study aflatoxin B1 adduct 
distribution in DNA (D'Andrea & Hazeltine, 1978). Among the first class of 
antitumour agents to be evaluated using the modified method were the 
ch lo ro eth y latin g  agents including several ch lo ro eth y ln itro so u reas 
(Hartley et al., 1986; Wurdeman & Gold, 1988). These compounds showed 
unexpected specificity for guanines located in the middle of a stretch of 
three or more guanines in a DNA sequence. The intensity of reaction was 
shown to increase with the number of consecutive flanking guanines 
although the intensity of the reaction at individual guanines within the 
run was found to vary. Several nitrogen mustard alkylating agents have 
also shown variations with respect to preferential alkylation of guanines 
in a DNA sequence.

Unlike the chloroethylnitrosoureas, the sequence specificity of certain 
nitrogen mustards was influenced by the substituent attached to the
reactive part of the molecule. Alkylation of central guanines in stretches 
of three or more guanines was also characteristic of many of the nitrogen 
mustards with the notable exception of uracil and quinacrine mustard.
Uracil mustard was found to preferentially react at 5 -PyGC sites which is 
poorly alkylated by other mustards including mechlorethamine. It has 
been suggested that preferential reaction of uracil mustard at these sites 
may be due to hydrogen bonding between the cytosine 3' amino group and 
the 04 atom of uracil mustard (Kohn et al., 1987). The ability of quinacrine 
mustard to intercalate between the bases of DNA is thought to be 
responsible for the extremely low concentration required for reaction. 
Previous studies have shown that alkylation of guanine residues by 
quinacrine mustard is enhanced if the two bases situated to the 3’  side of 
the reactive site are either GPu or TPu (Kohn et al., 1987).
Many other classes of chemotherapeutic alkylating agents have been 
evaluated for their ability to alkylate guanine residues in a sequence 
specific m anner including the triazenes (H artley et al., 1988b),
dimethanesulphonates (Ponti et al., 1991b) and diaziridinylbenzoquinones 
(Hartley et al., 1991a; Lee et al., 1992) . Included in these studies was the 
analysis of various structural analogues of the clinically useful
bioreductive agent AZQ (diaziquone). Among the key factors influencing 
the reactivity of several of these symmetrically substituted analogues were 
the substitutions at the 3 and 6 positions of the ring, the ease of reduction 
of the quinone function, and pH. Reactivity of several of these analogues
was increased at low pH and upon reduction of the quinone to the 
hydroquinone by either ascorbic acid or by the obligate two electron
53
reductase enzyme DT-Diaphorase (Hartley et al., 1991a; Lee et al., 1992). The 
pattern of guanine-N7 alkylation generated by several of these compounds 
in their quinone form was similar to that of the nitrogen mustard
compounds. However, upon reduction of one of the AZQ analogues, DZQ, the 
reactivity was significantly increased and the sequence specificity was 
substantially enhanced to alkylation of guanines in 5'-GC and in particular 
5-T G C  sequences. Molecular modelling studies have suggested that 
intercalation of the hydroquinone form of DZQ at 5 -GC sites is facilitated by 
hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl groups with the 02 and C4 groups of
cytosine. This allows the reactive aziridine carbons to be in a favourable 
position above the plane of the aromatic ring for covalent bond formation
to the guanine-N7 position (Hartley et al., 1991a). Such bonding would not
be possible with the quinone form of DZQ and would be inhibited by bulky 
groups located at the 3 and 6 position of the hydroquinone. In addition to 
the preferential alkylation of guanines at 5 -GC sites by the hydroquinone 
form of DZQ, new sites of alkylation were detected at adenine residues 
centrally located in 5'-AAA or 5 -TAA sequences. A 3,6-dimethyl analogue 
of DZQ, MeDZQ, also exhibited similar new sites of adenine alkylation upon 
reduction but did not exhibit preferential alkylation of guanines in 5 -GC
sequences (Lee et. al., 1992). These findings demonstrate that interactions 
of these compounds with DNA in a sequence selective manner is influenced 
to a large extent by subtle alterations in the structure of the moiety 
attached to the reactive component of the molecule.
The sequence preferences for alkylating agents which react principally at 
the N3 position of adenine residues can be determined by using a variation 
of the guanine-adenine specific chemical sequencing technique described 
by Maxam and Gilbert (Maxam & Gilbert, 1977; Maxam & Gilbert, 1980). In 
the original sequencing method, detection of adenines residues was
54
achieved by treating singly end-labelled DNA with dimethylsulphate in 
much the same way as for the guanine specific sequencing reaction 
(Maxam & Gilbert, 1977). Heating the resulting methylated purine DNA at 
neutral pH leads to depurination of the modified guanine and adenine 
residues. Subsequent strand scission upon treatment with dilute NaOH gives 
a pattern of strong bands at guanines and weak bands at adenines upon 
electrophoresis. In the modiHed method, the 3-alkyladenine residue is 
depurinated by acid treatment (O d rA H C \) Q-nd the production of 
strand breaks is catalysed by 04 M N Ic kO H » The sequence preference for 
adenine-N3 alkylation in the early promoter region of SV40 has been 
investigated for the exceedingly potent antitumour antibiotic CC-1065 using 
the above variation of the chemical sequencing technique (Hurley et al.,
1984; Reynolds et al., 1985). CC-1065 displayed a high level of specificity 
and was shown to react with adenines located in 5 -PuNTTA sequences and 
to the 3' terminal adenine of 5'-AAAAA sequences.
Compounds which cause direct breakage of DNA represent the most 
straightforward approach to the analysis of sequence specificity using the 
chemical cleavage method. Agents producing these types of lesions include 
bleomycin and neocarzinostatin (D'Andrea & Hazeltine 1978) but little 
sequence specificity was reported. One of the early compounds to 
demonstrate preferential cleaving of DNA with a sequence specificity was a 
penta-N-methylpyrrolecarboxamide-EDTA-Fe(H) (Schultz & Dervan, 1983).
The finding that coupling of the synthetic footprinting tool methidium 
propyl EDTA to DNA binding ligands led to the synthesis of a number of 
sequence specific cleaving molecules (Dervan, 1986). Extension of the 
modified Maxam-Gilbert procedures has also been used to study the ^ 
repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. It was previously thought that 
repair proceeded from a nick 5' to the pyrimidine dimer but it was
55
subsequently shown that the site of breakage actually occurred between 
the dimerized pyrimidines (Haseltine et al., 1980).
The strength of the chemical cleavage method can be attributed Mhe ease at 
which the technique can be carried out and that chemical modiOcations of 
guanine-N7 sites on the DNA are quantitatively converted to strand breaks 
(Mattes, et. al., 1986). The potential to evaluate DNA adduct distribution both
in isolated DNA and in various parts of the genome may provide insight
into specific DNA repair mechanisms. Unfortunately, simple alkylating 
agents produce other adducts in addition to guanine-N7 alkylations which 
cannot be analysed with this method (Lawley et al., 1975; Mattes, 1990).
1.8.1.2. Polymerase Inhibition
DNA adducts can act as a block to the action of certain polymerase enzymes 
( figure 1.12). Modification of the Sanger-dideoxy method has been utilised 
to measure adduct distribution for a variety of chemically reactive 
compounds (Sanger et al., 1977), It should be pointed out that dideoxy 
nucleotide triphosphates are not used in the evaluation of strand 
termination from drug treated DNAs. Studies have shown that E. Coli DNA
polymerase is normally inhibited one nucleotide before sites of UV induced
pyrimidine dimers (Moore et al., 1981). Other polymerase enzymes that 
have displayed the inability to bypass DNA adducts include AMV reverse 
transcriptase, alpha polymerase and Taq DNA polymerases (Moore & 
Strauss, 1979; Ponti et al., 1991a; Strauss et al., 1979). A weakness associated 
with techniques based on Sanger protocols is that drug treated duplex DNAs 
must be rendered single stranded and annealed to a primer prior to 
initiation of synthesis with the polymerase enzyme.

The presence of spurious bands in control reactions is often observed and 
can be due to factors such as contaminating nucleases, tertiary DNA
structure, and the presence of short fragments, all of which can cause
premature termination of synthesis from the template DNA.
1.8.1.3. Enzymatic Digestion
The sequence selectivity of DNA reactive compounds has also been assessed 
by their ability to block the action of certain nucleases. In a typical
experiment, end-labeled DNA fragments of known sequence are treated 
with the agent of interest and digested with an exonuclease. The presence 
of bulky DNA adducts can act as a barrier to further sequential DNA 
digestion. As with the chemical cleavage assays, the products of the 
reaction are usually separated on denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing 
gels and the presence of bands in the treated lanes give an indication of 
the sequence specificity of binding (figure 1.13).
The sites of DNA covalent modification have been analysed for a group of
natural and synthetic pyrrolo-[l,4]benzodiazepines (PBD's) using their 
ability to inhibit the action of exonuclease III (Hurley et al., 1988). 
Anthramycin and tomaymycin are the best known examples of the PBD 
compounds and it has been proposed that these agents react with the N2
position of guanine in the minor groove of DNA. In a similar study, the 
binding sites of a number of cis-platin analogues have recently been 
studied for their ability to inhibit the 3' to 5' exonuclease activity of T4 
polymerase using a synthetic DNA duplex (Farrell et al., 1990). Binding of a
compound to a restriction endonuclease recognition site can interfere with
the ability of the enzyme to cut DNA at that site.

Using this approach, restriction enzymes have been used to study the 
sequence binding sites of N-ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU) and N-methyl-N- 
nitrosourea (MNU) (Ahmed & Hadi, 1988). The conversion of plasmid DNA 
from open circular to linear form was shown to be inhibited by the 
presence of a guanine-06 adduct located in the restriction site of PstI 
(Green et al., 1984). More recent studies have provided information on the 
base sequence selectivity of anthracycline compounds by taking advantage 
of their ability to protect the cleavage of plasmid DNA by restriction 
endonucleases (Barcelo & Miro, 1991).
An interesting technique to evaluate the effect of DNA sequence on 
guanine adduct formation was dem onstrated using several synthetic 
oligomers with identical base composition but differing in the position of 
the guanine residue in the sequence (Briscoe & Cotter, 1984; Briscoe &
Cotter, 1985). Essentially, duplex oligonucleotides of defined sequence were 
alkylated and subsequently hydrolysed with acid to liberate 06 alkyl- and 
N7-guanine residues. The relative amounts of both adducts were
quantitated by high pressure liquid chromatography and the ratio of 
adducts were compared for each oligomer. In this way, the influence of 
DNA sequence on formation of 0 6  and-N7 guanine adducts can be 
evaluated. An analogous method for analysing sequence specificity of DNA 
adduct form ation in synthetic oligonucleotides was described by
(Richardson et al., 1989). Oligonucleotides of identical sequence but 
differing in the position of a radiolabelled guanine nucleoside were 
independently alkylated and enzymatically digested. The hydrolysed 
products are then separated by HPLC and fractions collected for liquid 
scintillation counting. Although the method suffers from a lack in
sensitivity, it offers the potential to study the effect of sequence on adduct
distribution and repair for lesions at different bases in the same duplex 
oligom er.
1.8.1.4. Footprinting
DNA footprinting was first used to determine the sequences in DNA which 
were bound by proteins (Drew & Travers, 1984; Galas & Schmitz, 1978).
Essentially, protein bound to a singly end-labeled DNA fragment of known 
sequence is subjected to limited cleavage with DNAse. DNA bound protein 
prevents the nuclease from cutting the DNA at the binding site. Separation 
of the cleavage products on a DNA sequencing gel shows bands at each base 
position for regions not protected by protein (figure 1.14). In contrast, the 
DNA sequence bound by protein is revealed by an absence of bands in the 
sequencing gel. The principle of DNA footprinting can also be extended to 
determine the sites of drug-DNA contacts. Although the sequence 
specificity of some non covalently binding compounds have been evaluated 
using the DNAse footprinting method (Lane et al., 1983), it is not the 
method of choice due to the slight preference for DNAse I to cleave DNA at 
certain sequences (Hertzberg & Dervan, 1984). The finding by Dervan and 
co-workers that methidiumpropyl EDTA (MPE) cleaves DNA with almost no 
sequence specificity prompted the use of this reagent to define the 
sequence specificity of actinomycin D and distamycin (Dervan, 1986; 
Hertzberg & Dervan, 1984; Van Dyke et al., 1982). MPE also has the 
advantage of increased resolution over DNAse I for determining the 
binding of smaller molecules such as many of the antitumour drugs.

approach had an important advantage over both the DNAse I and MPE 
footprinting methods in that the production of hydroxyl radicals could be 
produced simply from readily available chemicals (Tullius & Dombroski,
1985; Tullius & Dombroski, 1987).
1.8.2. Cross-Linking Specificity
Although there are a variety of techniques available to measure the 
sequence specificity of monoalkylation induced by bifunctional agents, 
much less inform ation has been obtained concerning the sequence 
preferences for the form ation of DNA interstrand cross-links. The 
principle challenge in determ ining the cross-linking specificities of 
bifunctional agents is that the cross-link is only a minor component of a 
complex mixture, due to the inefficiency of many bifunctional agents.
Several enzymatic methods have been applied to the determination of the 
sequence specificity of DNA interstrand cross-links. For example, sites of 
DNA interstrand cross-links have been evaluated using the double strand 
specific 3'-5' exonuclease activity of Bal31 (Zhen et al., 1986). Treatment of 
cross-linked DNAs with endonucleases and polymerases have also been used 
to study patterns o f cross-link form ation. In the absence of 
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, the 3' to 5’  exonuclease activity associated 
with T4 DNA polymerase was shown to be blocked by psoralen monoadducts 
and cross-links in DNA of defined sequence (Sage & Moustacchi 1987; Boyer 
et. al., 1988). Piette and Hearst have demonstrated that the E . co li  DNA 
polymerase I haloenzyme is capable of bypassing psoralen induced DNA 
monoadducts but not DNA interstrand cross-links using a nick translation 
assay (Piette & Hearst 1983). The polymerase and exonuclease techniques 
are particularly informative in that they allow the evaluation of many
63
potential cross-link sites simultaneously. In general, most enzyme assays 
can provide some insight into the sequence specificity of cross-linking but 
are often limited by the resolution of the resulting fragments and an 
uncertainty as to whether these enzymes can be inhibited with different 
types of DNA damage inflicted by other bifunctional agents. These methods 
show inhibition of enzymes at sites of DNA covalent modification but may 
not be specific for sites of DNA cross-links.
Another approach which has been used to investigate the sequence 
preferences for DNA cross-link formation involves the reaction of 
bifunctional agents with synthetic oligonucleotides of defined sequence. 
Separation of cross-linked fragments from uncross-linked fragments can 
be achieved using denaturing PAGE in thin sequencing gels. The presence 
of a high concentration of urea in denaturing polyacrylamide gels and the 
increased running temperature during electrophoresis ensures untreated 
DNA fragments migrate as single strands through these gels. The 
formation of a cross-link in a duplex DNA fragment will prevent the 
complete dénaturation of the two complementary strands during separation 
and thus cross-linked DNAs will migrate with a diminished mobility 
through the gel. Radiolabeling of the DNA prior to electrophoretic 
separation affords a high degree of sensitivity for the detection of cross- 
linked products which often constitute only a very small percentage of the 
total reaction products. In a sample of DNA in which some of the duplexes 
are cross-linked, two bands will appear upon separation with the cross- 
linked fragments migrating with a diminished electrophoretic mobility. 
Cross-linking in synthetic DNA fragments and separation of the reaction 
products using denaturing PAGE has been reported for a number of agents 
including nitrogen mustard and mitomycin C (Cera et al., 1989; Hopkins et
64
al., 1991; Millard et al., 1990; Millard et al., 1991; Millard et al., 1990; Teng 
et al., 1989; Weidner et al., 1990).
Although denaturing PAGE readily separates cross-linked DNA from 
uncross-linked DNA, no information is obtained regarding the exact site of 
cross-linking at the atomic or nucleotide level. Instead, the sequence 
preference for cross-linking is inferred since the sequences of the duplex
oligonucleotides are known. In some cases, the cross-linked product has 
been excised from the gel and subjected to chemical cleavage reactions in
an effort to determine the exact site of linkage. A method for locating the 
preferred site of DNA interstrand cross-linking for nitrogen mustard has 
recently been described using a piperidine fragmentation assay (Millard et 
al., 1990). It was found that nitrogen mustard preferentially cross-linked
DNA duplexes through deoxyguanosine residues in a 5 -GNC sequence 
and not at 5 -CG sequences as previously thought (Brooks & Lawley, 1961;
Brooks & Lawley, 1963). A similar approach for the determination of DNA 
cross-linking sequence specificity at single nucleotide resolution has been 
described using hydroxyl radical footprinting techniques (Weidner et al., 
1989). The method involves separation of singly end labeled cross-linked
DNA oligonucleotides by denaturing PAGE in an initial preparative step.
The cross-linked DNA is then subjected to random fragmentation using 
hydroxyl radical. Only cleavage between the radiolabel and the cross- 
linked residue will generate fragments shorter than the full length single 
strand. Fragmentation at any other position in the cross-linked duplex will
result in much larger fragment due to the presence of the cross-link. 
Hence a discontinuity is produced in the banding pattern produced from a 
cross-linked fragment which is diagnostic for the site of cross-linking.
With this technique, the sequence preferences for the formation of DNA 
cross-links in synthetic duplexes has been reported for a number of agents
65
including nitrogen mustard, cis-platin, mitomycin C and a series of
structural analogues of mitomycin C (Hopkins et al., 1991; Millard et al.,
1991; Weidner et al., 1990).
The strength of this method lies in the fact that hydroxyl radicals are
thought to cleave DNA by extracting a hydrogen atom from the ribose 
sugar of the DNA backbone and thus cleave DNA with almost no sequence 
specificity (Tullius & Dombroski, 1987). Unfortunately, the efficiency of 
the fragmentation reaction is quite low and requires a great deal of 
radioactively labeled cross-linked product to determine the site of cross- 
linking. In addition, the detection of the site of cross-linking is at the
nucleotide level and no information is gained about the nature of the 
cross-link at the atomic level.
1.9. Objectives for Experimental Work
The continuing importance of bifunctional alkylating agents in cancer 
chemotherapy together with their ability to cross-link DNA underlines the 
necessity for suitable methods to study this important aspect of drug DNA 
interaction. A variety of techniques has been utilised for the detection 
and measurement of DNA interstrand cross-linking. However, with the 
continuous development and synthesis of new cross-linking agents it 
becomes increasingly impractical, time consuming and expensive to assess 
the extent of cross-linking using existing techniques. In addition, many of 
the techniques used to detect DNA cross-linking in isolated DNA lack 
sensitivity and are generally not well suited to quantitative analysis. As a 
result, one of the objectives of this study was to develop a simple and 
sensitive assay to evaluate the extent and rate of DNA cross-link formation 
applicable to all cross-linking agents.
66
The second objective of this study was to gain some insight into the
sequence preferences for the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links
induced by structurally distinct bifunctional agents. Although the 
sequence preference for monoalkylation has been well documented for
many of the alkylating agents, the sequence actually cross-linked by these
compounds is much less clear. The studies outlined below attempt to
unambiguously define the sequence preferences for the formation of DNA
cross-links induced in synthetic DNA fragments using a piperidine
fragmentation assay and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
67
CHAPTER 2: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF AN  
AGAROSE GEL BASED METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF DNA  
INTERSTRAND CROSS LINKS
The development and implementation of an agarose gel based assay to 
measure interstrand cross-links in isolated DNA is described. The 
technique is based on the principle that, following complete dénaturation, 
DNA fragments containing a covalent cross-link can be separated from 
uncross-linked fragments upon electrophoresis (figure 2.1). An untreated
double stranded DNA fragment will migrate as a single band upon neutral 
agarose gel electrophoresis. Upon dénaturation, the DNA becomes single 
stranded and migrates with an increased mobility through the gel relative 
to that of double stranded DNA . The presence of a cross-link between the 
two complementary strands of a DNA fragment will prevent complete 
separation of the strands upon dénaturation and will serve as a point for
the re-association of the DNA upon renaturation (Eigen & Porschke 1970).
Thus, DNA fragments containing a cross-link will migrate as double 
stranded through an agarose gel. For example, if 50% of the DNA fragments 
in a given sample are cross-linked, two bands of equal intensity but 
different electrophoretic mobility will appear in the gel. The slower 
migrating band represents the fraction of DNA fragments which are cross- 
linked while the band migrating with increased mobility comprises the 
remaining uncross-linked single-stranded DNA. Quantitation of the 
amount of DNA migrating as double stranded in a drug treated sample
provides an accurate measurement of the extent of DNA cross-linking.
The following studies describe the development and evaluation of an 
agarose gel based assay for the measurement of DNA interstrand cross­
links induced by several different classes of bifunctional alkylating
68
agents. Among the agents studied were the clinically useful nitrogen  
mustard compounds and platinum complexes, as well as recently developed
b ifu n c tio n a l agen ts of  
pyrrolobenzodiazepine class.

2.2 Methods
2.2.1. Preparation of DNA
2.2.1.1. Linearisation of pBR322
Approximately 20 pg of closed circular pBR322 DNA was digested with 30 
units of Hind III in 60 pi of Ix Hind III buffer. The reaction was carried out 
at 37° C for 30 min. Following enzymatic digestion, an equal volume of 
buffer saturated (TE pH 7.2) phenol was added to the sample and briefly 
mixed by use of a vortex mixer. The sample was then briefly centrifuged to 
separate the aqueous and organic phases. The upper aqueous phase was 
carefully removed and placed into a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube. An equal 
volume of TE buffer was added to the organic phase, vortex mixed and 
briefly centrifuged. The aqueous phase was removed from above the 
phenol and combined with the aqueous phase from the first extraction. 
Any traces of phenol were removed from the aqueous phase by adding an 
equal volume of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (24:1), vortex mixed and 
briefly centrifuged. The upper aqueous phase was removed as before and 
placed in a clean 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Extraction with chloroform: 
isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was repeated and the DNA sample subsequently 
ethanol precipitated. Unless otherwise specified ethanol precipitation was 
performed by adjusting the DNA solution to 0.3 M in sodium acetate and 1  
mM EDTA prior to addition of 3 volumes of 95% ethanol. The DNA/salt 
containing sample was then thoroughly mixed using a vortex mixer and 
immersed into a dry ice/95 % ethanol bath for at least 15 min. Precipitated 
DNA was subsequently centrifuged for 15 min at 4° C. The supernatant was 
carefully removed by tilting the microfuge tube slightly and drawing off 
the liquid with a pasteur pipet. Any remaining ethanol was evaporated 
under vacuum. The DNA pellet was washed with 100 |il of ice cold 70%
73
ethanol, dried briefly under vacuum and resuspended in 50 pi of distilled 
deionised water.
2.2.1.2. Déphosphorylation
Déphosphorylation reactions were carried out in 100 p i of Ix BAP buffer
containing 10 units of BAP. The sample was incubated for 60 minutes at 65® 
C and allowed to cool slowly on the bench to room temperature. The
dephosphorylated DNA was extracted 2x with one volume of buffer
saturated phenol (TE pH 7.2) and 2x with one volume of chloroform: isoamyl 
alcohol (24:1). The sample was then ethanol precipitated, dried and washed 
with 100 pi of 70% ethanol. All traces of ethanol were carefully removed 
with a pasteur pipet. The sample was then briefly dried under vacuum and 
resuspended in 50 pi of distilled deionised water.
M ini-gel A nalvsis: A small representative sample of DNA (1 pi) was
analysed after each DNA modification step to check that the enzyme 
modifications did not damage the DNA. The samples from each step were 
ethanol precipitated and resuspended in either 5 pi of denaturing or non­
denaturing buffer. Electrophoreses was through a 0.8% agarose mini-gel 
at 50V for 3 h on a 10 cm support. Samples were stained in 0.001 mg/ml 
ethidium bromide in distilled water for 1  h at 20® C. Excess ethidium 
bromide was removed by soaking the gel in distilled water for 30-40
minutes. DNA was visualised under UV light using a transilluminator.
2.2.1.3. Determination of DNA Concentration
A small aliquot (5 pi) of the Hind HI, BAP treated DNA was removed and 
diluted to 1  ml with dH 2 0 (1 :  200 dilution). The absorbance of the solution
74
was measured at 260 nm. An absorbance of 1.0 OD was assumed to 
correspond to a double stranded DNA concentration of 50 pg/ml (Maniatis et 
ai., 1982).
2.2.1.4. 5 *  End Labeling
Approximately 1  pg of Hind III, BAP treated pBR322 DNA was labeled in 20 pi 
of forward reaction buffer containing 20 uCi of [y -^^P] ATP and 5 units of 
T4 polynucleotide kinase. The sample was incubated at 37° C for 45 minutes 
prior to ethanol precipitation.
The DNA was precipitated a second time by resuspending the pellet in 50 pi 
of 0.3 M sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA and adding 3 volumes of 95% ethanol.
After the second precipitation, the pellet was washed with 100 pi of cold 
70% ethanol, dried briefly under vacuum and resuspend at 10 ng/pl in 
distilled deionised water. The labeled DNA stock solution was stored shielded 
at -20° C until required.
2.2.2. Drug Treatments
Reactions were carried out in TEA buffer containing 10-25 ng of DNA at 37°
C in the appropriate volume. Reactions were terminated by addition of an 
equal volume of alkylation stop solution and ethanol precipitated. After 
careful removal of the supernatant, the DNA pellet was dried briefly under 
vacuum .
75
2.2.3. Preparation of Agarose Gels
Agarose solutions (0.8% w/v) were prepared by bringing 2.4 g of ultrapure 
agarose to 300 ml with TAE buffer in a 500 ml conical flask. The agarose 
was dissolved by heating the solution in a microwave oven on high setting 
for 4 minutes with occasional swirling until all agarose had dissolved. 
Alternatively, the solution was placed on a hot plate with constant stirring 
until all agarose was dissolved. For mini-gels 0.24 g of agarose was brought 
to 30 ml and prepared as described above. The hot solution was allowed to 
cool to 50° C before pouring it into a 20 x 25 cm gel support containing well 
forming combs.
2.2.4. Electrophoresis
Samples were resuspended in 10 pi of strand separation buffer by use of a 
vortex mixer and briefly centrifuged to remove all buffer from the 
microfuge tube walls. The samples were then heated to 90° C for 2 minutes 
and immediately immersed in an ice/water bath. Control undenatured
samples were resuspended in 1 0 pi of non-denaturing buffer, briefly 
centrifuged and loaded directly into the gel.
Electrophoresis was carried out using a 0.8% submerged agarose gel (20 cm 
X  25 cm X  0.5 cm) in TAE buffer. Samples were initially electrophoresed at 
100 V for 5 min and then at 40 V for 14-16 hr.
2.2.5. Autoradiography
Gels were dried for 2 h at 80° C onto one layer of Whatman 3 MM and one 
layer of DE81 filter papers on a Bio-Rad model 583 gel dryer under vacuum.
76
Autoradiographic images were obtained after exposure of Hyperfilm MP 
(Amersham) to the dried gel for 4-6 h at -70®C using a DuPont-Cronex 
Lightening-plus intensifying screen. Alternatively, film was exposed to 
the dried gel without a screen to obtain sharper images.
2.2.6. Densitometry
Microdensitometry of the autoradiogram was performed using a Pharmacia 
LKB enhanced Ultrascan-XL laser densitom eter. Integration and 
quantitation was carried out using Pharmacia GSXL 2.1 software. 
Calculation of percentage double stranded DNA was determined by the
following equation;
% Cross-linked DNA = {A(ds DNA)/[A(ds DNA) + A(ss DNA)] }  x 100 ; where 
A (ds DNA) is the area under the curve calculated for DNA migrating as 
double stranded and A(gg DNA) corresponds to the area under the curve for
DNA migrating as single stranded.
2.2.7. Spectrophotometry
Spectrophotometric analysis of quinone reduction by DT-Diaphorase was 
carried out on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer 
under aerobic conditions. Reactions were performed in 1  ml of TEA buffer
(pH 5.8) containing 100 pM  NADH and 100 pM  quinone. The rate of 
reduction was measured at the absorbance maximum for the quinone-NADH 
mixture and was initiated by the addition of 1  p i of DT-Diaphorase (0.173 
Itg).
77
2.3 Development of the Assay
2.3.1. Determination of Optimal DNA Denaturing
Conditions
Linearised double stranded pBR322 DNA (4362 bp) migrates as a single band 
through a 0.8% agarose gel under non-denaturing conditions. Under 
denaturing conditions the DNA becomes single stranded and migrates with 
increased mobility through the gel relative to that of undenatured DNA. To 
assess the extent of cross-linking induced by a given agent it is desirable to 
achieve complete dénaturation of the control DNA. In order to develop a 
consistent and reliable method for denaturing double stranded DNA, both 
alkaline and thermal dénaturation conditions were evaluated.
In order to determine the optimal conditions for thermal dénaturation, 
native DNA was incubated in strand separation buffer for various times and 
temperatures and immediately immersed in an ice water bath prior to 
electrophoresis. Figure 2.2A shows that after 2 min at 90® C, more than
95% of the DNA becomes denatured and migrates as single stranded upon
electrophoresis. In contrast, native DNA was not denatured after 2 min at
temperatures less than 65® C.
The ability of alkali to denature double stranded DNA was investigated using 
electrophoresis sample buffer containing various concentrations of sodium 
hydroxide figure 2.2B. DNA samples were resuspended in 10 p i of alkaline
buffer, allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 minutes and loaded
directly into the gel. Alkaline electrophoresis buffer containing at least 
100 mM NaOH was required to achieve complete dénaturation of the DNA 
while only partial dénaturation was observed at 50 mM. Partial degradation 
of the DNA incubated with 500 mM could be detected upon electrophoresis.

79
A time course for the thermal dénaturation of native DNA in strand 
separation buffer was carried out at 90° C to determine the minimum time 
required to achieve com plete dénaturation figure 2.2C. P artial 
dénaturation of the DNA could be detected after 90 seconds at 90° C and DNA 
became completely denatured after 2 min. In addition, no thermal 
degradation of the denatured DNA was observed at incubation times up to 5 
m inutes.
2.3.2. Applications
2.3.2.1. Dose Response
The formation of cross-links induced in DNA by bifunctional agents can be 
evaluated as a function of drug concentration. Dose response experiments 
were carried out in TEA buffer containing 10-25 p . g of DNA in a final 
volume of 50 pi for a range of drug concentrations. Figure 2.3a shows the 
formation of cross-links induced in DNA by different concentrations of 
melphalan. Quantitation of the amount of cross-linking can be determined 
by microdensitometry of the autoradiogram. The resulting data can be 
expressed as the extent of cross-linking as a function of drug 
concentration and is shown in figure 2.3b for melphalan.
2.5.2.2. Time course studies
DNA cross-linking can be measured as a function of time by incubating the 
drug with DNA and terminating the reaction at defined time points by 
ethanol precipitation. Time course studies were carried out at 37° C by 
incubating the drug with 1-2.5 ng of labeled DNA/pl of TEA buffer. At 
defined times, a 1 0 pi aliquot was removed from the reaction mixture and

at various time points is shown in figure 2.4A. Cross-linking was observed 
to increase with time and did not reach a plateau after 8 hr. Following 
quantitation of the autoradiograph by densitometry, the data from time 
course studies can% xpressed as the percentage of cross-linked DNA as a 
function of time. Results for melphalan are shown graphically in figure 
2.4B.
2.3.2.3. Second Arm Cross-Link formation
Dose response and time course experiments give information on the overall 
extent and rate of DNA cross-link formation in the presence of excess drug. 
However, the formation « 4  DNA interstrand cross-links consists of two 
separate events. The first event occurs upon the initial alkylation on one 
strand of double stranded DNA by a bifunctional agent. The second event 
occurs upon covalent reaction of the "second arm" of the bifunctional 
compound with the complementary strand. In order to measure the rate at 
which m onoadducts are converted to DNA interstrand cross-links, all 
unbound drug must be removed from the reaction mixture. Second arm 
cross-linking studies were thus carried out by removing unbound drug 
from the DNA by ethanol precipitation, after an initial incubation with 
excess drug, and resuspending the DNA in drug-free buffer. Any cross­
links formed after removal of unbound drug are therefore due to the 
conversion of monoalkylations to cross-links.
Figure 2.5A shows cross-links induced by melphalan at defined times points 
after removal of free drug. After an initial incubation of 60 min in the 
presence of 10 pM drug, approximately 10% of all DNA fragments in the 
sample are cross-linked. The amount of cross-linked DNA in the sample

2.3.3. Sensitivity of the Assay
Nitrogen mustards such as melphalan are efficient cross-linking agents.  
However, the assay is sensitive enough to measure cross-links induced in  
DNA by relatively slow and inefficient cross-linking compounds such as  
the clinically used antitumour agent busulfan. Busulfan is a bifunctional
alkylating agent capable of forming cross-links in DNA but the formation  
of busulfan cross-links has not previously been demonstrated using  
physicochemical methods such as caesium chloride gradients. Figure 2.6
shows the time course for the formation of DNA cross-links induced by
busulfan. DNA cross-linking increased slowly to approximately 5% over a
period of 24 hours using 1  mM busulfan at 37° C.

2.4 Evaluation of DNA Cross-linking Induced  
Bifunctional Agents
2.4.1. Nitrogen Mustardsb y85
A number of nitrogen mustard analogues were evaluated for their ability to  
induce cross-links in DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis. Figure 2.7  
shows the time course for the formation of DNA cross-links induced by five  
nitrogen mustard compounds at equimolar concentrations. The initial rate  
and overall extent of cross-linking varied greatly for all five mustards with  
mechlorethamine clearly the most efficient cross-linking agent followed  
by uracil m ustard, m elphalan, phosphoram ide m ustard and  
isophosphoramide mustard.

In addition, over 95% of DNA fragments were cross-linked by 
mechlorethamine at 2 hr while uracil mustard appeared to reach a plateau 
with roughly 70% of DNA cross-linked at 5 hr. In contrast, melphalan
continues to form DNA cross-links at 6 hr. Clearly, the structure of the
moiety attached to the chloroethylating portion of the drug influences 
both the rate and extent of DNA interstrand cross-link formation.
Time course reactions give information into the overall extent and rate of 
cross-link formation. However, DNA cross-link formation consists of two 
separate events. Figure 2.8 compares the rate of second arm cross-link 
formation in the absence of unbound drug together with the time course 
for cross-link formation for three mustard compounds. After a short initial 
incubation of excess drug with DNA, unbound drug is removed and the DNA 
is resuspended in drug-free buffer. For 10 pM  m ech lo reth am in e, 
approximately 10% of DNA fragments are cross-linked after an initial 10 
minute incubation. No increase in DNA cross-link formation was observed 
7 hr after removal of unbound drug. In contrast, following a 60 min initial 
incubation of the DNA with melphalan, the level of cross-linking increased 
from 10% to 36% 5 hours after removal of unbound drug. Although cross-
linking also increased from 5% to 34% after a 30 min pre-incubation with 
uracil mustard, the level of cross-linking appears to reach a maximum 2 
hours after removal of unbound drug.
2.4.2. Cisplatin and Carboplatin
A comparison of the cross-linking efficiency of cisplatin and carboplatin
is shown in figure 2.9 for a range of concentrations. For cisplatin, cross­
links could be detected down to 0.1 pM with 100% cross-linking occurring at 
10 pM . In contrast, cross-linking with carboplatin was detected at 10 p M

increasing doses of drug that produce 100% of cross-linked DNA, the band
migrates with an increased mobility through the gel. This effect may be
due to the contortional bending of DNA induced by the formation of
intrastrand cross-links by both compounds. More bending induced at  
higher concentrations may result in an increased mobility of the cross-
linked DNA through the gel.

the quinone moiety generates a reactive hydroquinone species which is  
capable of alkylating and cross-linking DNA via the aziridine rings (figure
2.1 IB). Interstrand cross-links induced in DNA by these compounds in  
their unreduced (quinone) form at equimolar concentrations is shown in  
figure 2.12A. After incubation at 37° C for 1  hour only BZQ and DZQ were
capable of inducing interstrand cross-links at neutral pH. However, with
the exception of BZQ, a significant increase in the level of DNA cross-  
linking was observed upon reduction of the quinones with NADH and DT-
Diaphorase (figure 2.12B).

92
The level of cross-linking observed with BZQ in the presence or absence of 
DT-Diaphorase was 58% and 65% respectively suggesting that BZQ is a poor 
substrate for DT-Diaphorase. Moreover, the level of cross-linking induced 
in DNA by DZQ and MeDZQ was substantially enhanced upon reduction, 
suggesting these compounds are good substrates for DTD. In general, the 
extent of DNA cross-linking was reduced as the size of the groups attached 
to the 3 and 6 positions of the quinone ring increased.
In order to study in more detail the increase in the level of DNA cross-links 
induced by DZQ and MeDZQ upon reduction, DNA was reacted with either DZQ 
or MeDZQ in the presence or absence of DTD for a range of drug 
concentrations. Figure 2.13 shows that for unreduced DZQ 100% cross-

linking occurred at 100 p. M under these conditions. However, upon 
reduction of DZQ with DTD, the same level of cross-linking was achieved at 1  
pM . Similarly for MeDZQ, approximately 50% cross-linking was observed 
for the unreduced form of MeDZQ at 100 pM while only 0.1 pM was required 
to achieve a comparable level of cross-linking upon reduction. The 
complete loss of samples at the higher drug concentrations under both 
reducing and non-reducing conditions may be due in part to DNA strand 
scission. This is particularly evident for the reduced compounds and may 
be a result of the production of semiquinone radicals which are capable of 
causing DNA single strand breaks.
The time course for DNA cross-link formation induced by reduced DZQ and 
MeDZQ is shown in figure 2.14. After 2 hours, DZQ produced over two fold 
more DNA cross-links than MeDZQ at equimolar concentrations. No further 
increase in DNA cross-linking was detected after 2 hr for either compound.
Spectrophotometric analysis of the reduction of DZQ, MeDZQ, AZQ and BZQ 
by DT-diaphorase was carried out in order to assess the relationship 
between quinone reduction and the level of DNA cross-linking. The 
absorbance spectrum of a solution containing 100 pM  quinone in the 
presence or absence of DT-diaphorase and NADH was monitored with time. 
Figure 2.15A and B shows the individual absorbance profile for both DT- 
diaphorase and NADH. Figure 2.15C shows that no change in absorbance 
could be detected upon incubation of 0.1 mM NADH with 173 ng of DT- 
diaphorase. Sim ilarly, no change in absorbance was observed for a 
solution containing 0.1 mM DZQ and 0.1 mM NADH after 10 minutes in the 
absence of DT-diaphorase (figure 2-15E). However, addition of DT- 
diaphorase to a solution containing DZQ and NADH resulted in the immediate 
decrease in the absorbance profile of DZQ and NADH (figure 2.15F). It

should be noted that no change in absorbance could be detected upon

NADH (data not shown)
The absorbance spectrum of NADH (2.15B) and DZQ (2.15D) is additive and  
their combined spectrum is shown in figure 2.15E. Thus a decrease in  
absorbance maximum for their combined spectrum upon addition of DT-  
diaphorase represents both NADH oxidation and a decrease in the  
concentration of the quinone form of DZQ. Hence, a decrease in the  
absorbance maximum for the quinone-NADH combined spectrum provides a  
reasonable measurement for the rate of DT-diaphorase mediated quinone  
reduction (Siegel et. al., 1990a).

Spectrophotometry was also used to examine the reduction of MeDZQ 
(2.15H), AZQ (2.151) and BZQ (2.15J) by DT-diaphorase. The change in the 
absorbance maximum for each quinone-NADH sample was measured after 
the addition of DT-diaphorase and shown in figure 2.16. Clearly, DZQ is 
most readily reduced followed by MeDZQ and AZQ. Thus the initial rate of 
reduction for DZQ, MeDZQ and AZQ under aerobic conditions could be 
correlated with the level of cross-linking induced in isolated DNA (figure 
2.12). However, very little change in the absorbance spectrum of BZQ was 
observed in the presence of NADH and DT-diaphorase suggesting that little 
or no reduction takes place after a 15 minute incubation. This result is 
consistent with the finding that the level of BZQ induced DNA cross-links 
was similar in the presence (58%) and absence (65%) of DT-diaphorase 
(figure 2.12 A,B).

2.4.4. Pyrrolobenzodiazepines
The pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) compounds are group of naturally 
occurring anitumour antibiotics. PBD compounds such as anthramycin 
and tomaymycin are alkylating agents capable of forming a covalent bond 
with the guanine-N2 position in the minor groove of DNA(Hertzberg et al., 
1986). Previous studies have dem onstrated that a num ber of 
monofunctional PBD compounds exhibit a pronounced DNA sequence 
specificity in which guanines located between purines are preferentially 
alkylated(Hertzberg et al., 1986; Hurley et al., 1988). In an effort to extend 
the sequence specificity of PBD agents, a bifunctional PBD compound has 
recently been synthesised (DSB-120) in which the two reactive units of the 
molecule consist of the monofunctional alkylating agent DC-81 (figure 2.17)

As a result of the high efficiency of DNA cross-linking induced by DSB-120, 
a series of structurally related C8-linked bifunctional alkylating agents 
were synthesised (figure 2.19). These compounds varied in the length of 
the methylene chain (n=3 to n=6) connecting the two reactive portions of 
the molecule. In order to assess the effect of linker length on DNA cross- 
linking efficiency, these analogues were reacted with DNA over a range of 
concentrations. Figure 2.20 shows the effect of varied chain length on the

and (n=5) compounds exhibited similar levels of cross-linking while the 
(n=4) and (n=6) analogues were approximately 18 and 14 fold less efficient, 
respectively (figure 2.21 ).
In order to assess the effect of increasing the concentration of the DNA 
substrate while keeping the drug concentration constant, an identical 
range of DSB-120 concentrations was reacted with either 10 or 50 ng of DNA 
and electrophoresed under identical conditions. Although a stronger 
signal was observed in samples containing high DNA concentration, 
quantitation of the cross-linked DNA for each dose revealed that increasing 
the DNA concentration five fold did not increase the level of DNA cross- 
linking to the same extent figure 2.22. These data show that DNA cross- 
linking was largely independent of the concentration of DNA substrate and 
depended primarily on the initial concentration DSB-120.

2.5 Discussion
These studies attempt to describe a simple, rapid and sensitive agarose gel 
based assay for the measurement of DNA interstrand cross-links. The
method is based on the differential migration of double stranded and single 
stranded DNA through a neutral agarose gel. Native double stranded DNA 
migrates as a single band upon electrophoresis. DNA which has been 
denatured, either by heat or alkali, becomes single stranded and migrates 
with an increased electrophoretic mobility. A DNA interstrand cross-link 
prevents the complete separation of com plem entary strands under 
denaturing conditions and provides a point for the reassociation of the 
DNA. As a result, linear DNA fragments containing a cross-link will
migrate as double stranded and can be separated from uncross-linked DNA 
upon electrophoresis. Thus it is possible to measure the extent of cross-
linking in drug treated samples by measuring the amount of DNA
migrating as double stranded. The assay is particularly applicable to the
comparison of cross-links induced by structurally related compounds for a 
range of concentrations. In addition to measuring the extent of cross-
linking induced by a given concentration of drug, the technique can be
extended to measure the time course for the formation of DNA cross-links
induced by a variety of cross-linking agents. The conversion of DNA
monoadducts to cross-links can also be measured using a modification of 
the time course reaction.
Sensitivity of the method is enhanced by the use of a radiolabeled DNA
substrate and allows routine detection of samples containing as little as 5-10
ng of DNA. Thus 1  pg of end labelled DNA is sufficient for five 20 lane
experiments. Although conditions were optimised for 5' end labeling of the 
DNA to achieve a high level of specific activity, it is also possible to 3 *  end
105
label the DNA. It should be noted that highly purified DNA, preferably 
from a commercial source, should be used to obtain optimal labeling and 
gave the best results. Although purified plasmid pBR322 DNA was used in 
these studies, DNA from different sources and of sufricient quality could be 
substituted for pBR322 DNA for the analysis of in-vitro cross-linking.
Quantitation of cross-linked DNA and uncross-linked DNA within the same 
lane by laser densitometry of the autoradiograph allows the extent of cross- 
linking to be calculated directly without taking into account any variation 
in sample loading. Although analysis of the autoradiograph by 
densitometry is the method of choice for the quantitation of DNA cross­
links, an alternative method involves exposing the gel to autoradiographic 
film, excising the bands and counting the amount of radioactivity in each 
band. Nonlabeled DNA can also be used as the substrate in cross-linking 
reactions but requires an increased amount of DNA and detection by 
ethidium bromide. This method requires photography of the stained gel 
and processing of the negative for densitometry. In addition, ethidium 
bromide binds less efficiently to single stranded DNA and requires a 
correction factor for quantitative analysis.
Experiments designed to determine the optimal time and temperature for 
thermal dénaturation revealed that linear pBR322 DNA becomes completely 
denatured after 2 minutes at 90° C in strand separation buffer followed by 
snap cooling in an ice-w ater bath. These denaturing conditions 
consistently produced greater than 98% single stranded DNA upon 
electrophoresis. In addition, no degradation of the DNA was observed 
following a 5 minute incubation of the DNA at 90° C in strand separation 
buffer. Dénaturation could also be achieved by treatment of the DNA with 
at least 100 mM sodium hydroxide for two minutes at room temperature.
106
However, degradation of the DNA was observed at higher concentration of 
alkali and at longer times. Although thermal treatment was the method of 
choice for denaturing DNA, alkaline treatm ent of DNA containing
alkylations at the guanine-N7 and adenine-N3 positions has been shown to 
form imidazole ring opened products which are more stable to thermal 
treatment (Hemminki et. al., 1989). Extensive heat treatment of alkylated 
purines leads to the loss of guanine and adenine residues from DNA and is 
the basis for the G>A sequencing reactions described by Max am and Gilbert 
(1977). At 100® C, the half life for depurination of DNA containing 7- 
methylguanine and 7-(2-aminoethyl)guanine at neutral pH was reported to 
be 4.1 and 1.5 minutes respectively (Hemminki et. al., 1989). The half lives 
were increased to 69 and 34 minutes upon pretreatment of the alkylated 
DNA with 0.25 M NaOH to form ring opened products. Hence, extensive
thermal treatment of DNA cross-linked through purine residues might lead 
to depurination reactions and an underestimation of the extent of cross-
linking induced by major groove alkylating agents such as the nitrogen 
mustards. Although thermal depurination was not observed under the 
conditions used, a decrease in the total autoradiographic signal was detected 
in some cases at very high doses of major groove alkylating agents which 
may reflect, in part, a depurination and strand scission reaction. 
Treatment of DNA containing N7-alkylguanines with dilute alkali to
generate a more stable ring opened adduct may be a viable option if the 
heat dénaturation step is believed to cause significant depurination.
All reactions were carried out in triethanolamine buffers principally 
because no adjustm ent for positive ion (sodium, potassium , etc.) 
concentration was required upon ethanol precipitation of the DNA. Cross- 
linking reactions can be carried out in sodium or potassium phosphate 
buffers provided their presence is taken into account in the precipitation
107
step. If the concentration of salt is too high in the reaction mixture then 
some salt will precipitate along with the DNA which will subsequently 
interfere with gel loading and electrophoresis.
The method described in these studies provides a useful tool for the direct 
analysis of DNA cross-links induced by structurally distinct bifunctional 
agents. Data obtained with this assay may complement other techniques 
such as alkaline elution by giving basic information on the time course for 
chemical cross-linking without the influence of complicating cellular 
factors such as DNA repair.

CHAPTER 3: NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE PREFERENCES FOR THE  
FORMATION OF DNA CROSS-LINKS
DNA interstrand cross-linking agents are among the most effective 
compounds used in the treatment of human cancers. In many cases, the 
atomic sites on DNA which are covalently modiHed by these bifunctional 
drugs have already been well characterised (e.g. guanine N-7). In addition, 
the m onoalkylation sequence specificity of many chem otherapeutic 
a lk y la tin g  a g e n ts  in c lu d in g  th e  n itr o g e n  m u s ta rd s , 
chloroethylnitrosoureas, and triazenes has been established (Hartley, et. 
al., 1986, 1988a,b). For nitrogen mustard compounds, the guanine-N7 
sequence specificity was found to be dependent on the structure of the 
group attached to the non-reactive portion of the molecule with 
mechlorethamine preferring guanines located in the middle of 5'-GGG 
sequences (Hartley et. al., 1986). The isolation of guanines cross-linked 
through the N7 positions in hydrolysates of nitrogen mustard treated DNA 
together with experiments on static models of DNA first led to the 
reasonable suggestion that nitrogen mustards would preferentially cross­
link DNA through guanine-N7 positions in a 5 -GC sequence(Brooks and 
Lawley, 1961). Later studies, based on monoalkylation sequence specificity, 
also proposed that nitrogen mustard compounds might form cross-links in 
5 -GC sequences (Mattes et al., 1986a)(Kohn et. al., 1987).
More recently, the guanine N-7 sequence specificity of a series of 
structurally related analogues of AZQ was investigated upon chemical 
(Hartley et. al., 1991) or enzymatic reduction(Lee, et. al., 1992). While the 
quinone and hydroquinone forms of several structurally similar aziridines 
exhibited relatively non-specific alkylation of guanine-N7 positions, the
109
reduced form of DZQ reacted preferentially at guanines in 5 -GC sequences 
and more specifically at 5 -TGC sequences (Lee et al., 1992). A model was 
proposed to account for the unique reaction of the hydroquinone form of 
DZQ at 5 -GC sites (Hartley et al., 1991a)^ and suggested that the unique 
selectivity may result in an altered sequence preference for DNA 
interstrand cross-linking.
Thus although the sequence specificity of monoalkylation for the nitrogen 
mustard and aziridinylbenzoquinone compounds has previously been 
described, the sequence preferences for the formation of DNA cross-links 
induced by these compounds remained unclear. In the following studies 
the nucleotide sequence preferences for the formation of DNA interstrand 
cross-links induced by nitrogen mustard, DZQ and MeDZQ was investigated 
using synthetic oligonucleotides containing defined sequences. Analysis 
of preferential cross-link formation in oligonucleotides containing several 
p o ten tial cro ss-lin k in g  sites was carried  out by iso la tin g  
electrophoretically distinct cross-linked products and examining the 
pattern of guanine-N7 alkylation upon piperidine fragmentation.

Sep-Pak C l8 desalting columns were obtained from Waters (Millipore). 
Chemicals  :
Premixed electrophoresis grade acrylam ide:bis acrylamide (19:1) was 
obtained from Sigma and used as a 40% stock solution. Piperidine, NADH 
(grade III), ammonium persulphate, sodium ascorbate, boric acid and 
TEMED w ert also from Sigma. Dimethylsulphate and iron ammonium 
sulphate hexahydrate were obtained from Aldrich.
3.2. Methods
3.2.1. Preparation of Sequencing gels
Denaturing DNA sequencing gels were 20% acrylamideibis acrylamide 
(19:1), and 7 M urea in 90 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid and 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.3. 
Electrophoresis was carried out on a 0.4 mm x 50 cm x 20 cm (Bio-Rad) 
sequencing apparatus. Gels were prepared by combining 40 ml of 40% 
acrylamide stock solution, 8 ml of lOx TBE, and 33.63 g of urea and adjusting 
the final volume to 80 ml with distilled deionised water. The solution was 
gently heated to dissolve the urea and vacuum filtered through Whatman 3 
MM filter paper. The solution was then placed on ice in order to slow the
112
polymerisation reaction. 50 p.1 of TEMED and 70 p i of 25% aqueous
ammonium persulphate (w/v) were added to 10 ml of acrylamide solution, 
mixed and poured onto a thin strip of filter paper. The sequencing
apparatus was then pressed down on top of the filter paper so that the
solution would rise into the space between the plates at the bottom edge of
the apparatus by capillary action. Once the sealing gel had polymerised, 91 
pi of 25% aqueous APS and 70 pi of TEMED w e.%  added to the remaining 70 ml 
of acrylamide solution. The solution was mixed by swirling and carefully 
poured into the space between the two glass plates of the apparatus using a 
50 ml syringe fitted with a stopcock. Gels were allowed to polymerise for at 
least 1.5 hours or were left overnight for use in the morning. Following
polymerisation the gel was pre-electrophoresed at 3000 V for 1  hour. The 
sample wells were flushed with electrophoresis buffer to remove leeched
urea and unpolymerised acrylamide which can interfere with sample 
loading and electrophoresis.
3.2.2. Purification of Synthetic Oligonucleotides
This step in the procedure was necessary due to the fact that crude
synthetic oligonucleotides contain a small percentage of failure sequences 
which represent a significant proportion of the available 5' ends. These 
oligomers are thus disproportionately radiolabeled if not removed from full 
length sequences. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purified through a 20%
denaturing sequencing gel. Ethanol was removed from the crude 
oligomers following centrifugation for 15 minutes at 4° C. The pellets were 
dried briefly under vacuum and resuspended at Ip g /p l in deionised water. 
Approximately 100 pg of the crude oligomer was removed and lyophilized.
The DNA was subsequently resuspended in 20 pi of loading buffer, heated to 
90° C for 2 minutes and immersed in an ice water bath. Approximately 50
113
(ig (10 1 1 1 ) of DNA was loaded per well (15 mm x 10 mm x 0.4 mm wells; 8 well 
comb) using a 10 pi Hamilton syringe. Samples were electrophoresed at 
3000 V (plate temperature of 45-50° C) until the xylene cyanol dye marker 
had migrated approximately 8 cm. Following electrophoresis, the gel was 
transferred to Saran wrap and placed over a fluorescent TLC plate ( Merck
HPTLC silica gel, 60 F254 pre-coated, 10 cm x 20 cm). Bands were visualised
by illuminating the gel from above with short wave UV light and excised 
from the gel with a scalpel. The gel slices were crushed and soaked in 1  ml
of elution buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8,0, and 1  mM EDTA) in a 1.5
ml microfuge tube overnight at 37° C.
The DNA solution was desalted using a Sep-pak C-18 cartridge. The 
cartridge was prepared for desalting by flushing it with 10 ml of 
acetonitrile (in a fume hood) followed by 10 ml of distilled deionised water.
The buffer containing DNA (1.0 ml) was subsequently loaded onto the 
column and flushed with 10 ml of distilled deionised water to remove salt.
The DNA was eluted from the column as one 1.5 ml fraction with 60% 
aqueous methanol into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube.
The oligonucleotide concentration was estim ated by m easuring the 
absorbance of the oligonucleotide solution at 260 nm using 60% aqueous 
methanol as a blank. According to suppliers specification, an absorbance 
of 1.0 corresponded to a DNA concentration of 33 pg/ml. The methanol was 
evaporated from the DNA containing solution by heating the sample at 45®
C for 2 h and the remaining aqueous sample was lyophilized and 
resuspended at 0.5 p g /|il in ultrapure water. The purified oligonucleotide 
was stored at -20° C. Typical recovery of full length synthetic oligomer 
using this method was between 50-65%.
114
3.2.3. 5' End Labeling
3.2.3.1. Single site oligomers
Approximately 5.0 pg of the self complementary oligomers and 2.5 pg of the 
non-self complementary oligomers were independently labeled in 25 pi of 
Ix forward reaction containing 20 pCi of [y-^^P] ATP and 5 units of T4 
polynucleotide kinase. Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37° C.
3.2.3.2. Multiple site oligomers
Approximately 5.0 pg of the purified single stranded DNA oligomer was 5'
end-labelled in 25 pi of Ix forward reaction buffer containing 50 pCi of [y
-32p] ATP and 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reaction was 
carried out for 30 minutes at 37° C.
3.2.3.3. Removal of unincorporated ATP
Removal of unincorporated ATP and the recovery of labeled oligonucleotide 
was achieved using sephadex spin columns (Bio Rad). The column was
prepared during the radioactive labeling reaction by inverting it several 
times to resuspend settled gel matrix and allowing the storage buffer to 
drain out through the bottom of the column by gravity. Any remaining 
storage buffer was removed by placing the column in a 1.5 ml microfuge 
tube and centrifuging the column for 2 minutes in a swinging bucket rotor 
at llOOxg. Subsequently, 300 p i aliquots of distilled deionised water we% 
carefully added to the centre of the column and centrifuged for 2 minutes 
at llOOxg. This procedure was repeated four times to equilibrate the
colum n.
115
Following the labeling reaction, the sample was adjusted to 20 mM EDTA in a 
final volume of 50 pi. The sample was then carefully added to the centre of 
the spin column behind a safety screen. The column was subsequently 
placed in a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube and centrifuged at llOOxg for 4 min 
(100% recovery of the oligomer from the column was assumed). The 
column containing the unincorporated ATP was then discarded in a proper 
radioactive disposal container. The microfuge tube containing labeled DNA 
oligomer was then capped and immersed in an ethanol dry ice bath. The 
cap to the tube was then perforated prior to lyophilization.
The use of sephadex spin columns was preferred due both to the extreme 
inefficiency of ethanol precipitation of short DNA fragments and the 
efficient removal of unincorporated ATP.
3.2.4. Annealing conditions  
Single site oligomers
Following removal of unincorporated ATP, the self com plem entary 
oligom ers w ere co n cen trated  by ly o p h iliza tio n . The n o n -se lf 
complementary single stranded DNAs were combined, mixed by vortexing 
and briefly centrifuged prior to lyophilization. The samples were then 
resuspended in 20 pi of distilled deionised water and annealed by placing 
the tubes containing the samples in 200 ml of water at 65° C and allowing 
the solution to cool slowly to 4° C in a refrigerator.
116
Multiple site oligomers
In order to produce 5 *  singly end-labeled DNA duplexes, 5 pg of the 
unlabeled single stranded oligonucleotide was combined with 5 pg of its 
complementary strand. The solution was mixed by vortex and briefly
centrifuged. The sample was then placed into 200 ml of water at 90o C and 
allowed to cool slowly to room temperature.
3.2.5. Drug Reactions
All drug-DNA reactions were carried out in 50 pi of TEA buffer (pH 5.8 or 
7.2) containing approximately 2.5 pg of 5' end-labeled duplex DNA. All
reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of alkylation stop 
solution and ethanol precipitated. Following careful removal of the 
supernatant, samples were briefly dried under vacuum.
For the multiple site oligomers, reactions were carried out for 2 hours at 
37° C. After the incubation, a small aliquot (2 pi) of each reaction mixture 
was removed prior to separation of the reaction products in order to assess 
the total alkylation pattern (both monoadducts and cross-links). The 2 pi 
aliquot was added to 8 pi of distilled deionised water in a clean microfuge 
tube prior to precipitation with 10 pi of alkylation stop solution and 3 
volumes of ethanol. The DNA pellets were dried briefly under vacuum and
stored at -20° C for later analysis. The remaining reaction mixtures were 
terminated by addition of an equal volume of alkylation stop solution, 
ethanol precipitated and dried briefly under vacuum.
117
3.2.6. Separation and Isolation of Cross-Linked DNA
For single site oligomers, the drug treated DNA was resuspended in 5 pi of 
loading buffer and loaded into a 20% denaturing DNA sequencing gel. 
Samples were electrophoresed at 3000 V until the xylene cyanol dye front 
had migrated approximately 10 cm. Following electrophoresis, the gel was
carefully transferred to a processed piece of autoradiographic film. This 
was necessary due to the difficulty in attaching filter paper to high 
percentage polyacrylamide gels. Once the gel was transferred to the film it 
was immediately covered with food wrap (Saran) to prevent the gel from 
dehydration. The wet gel was exposed to autoradiographic film at room 
temperature for 15 minutes to 2 hours.
For multiple site oligomers, drug treated DNA was resuspended in 10 pi of 
loading buffer and loaded into a 20% denaturing sequencing gel. Samples 
were electrophoresed at 3000 V until the xylene cyanol marker dye had 
migrated approximately 15 cm. The gel was carefully transferred to a piece 
of processed film and covered with Saran wrap. The gel was fixed into 
place in the film cassette and a piece of autoradiographic film was placed 
on top of the gel. The film was exposed to the wet gel at room temperature
for 15 to 30 minutes. The image from the resulting processed
autoradiograph was used as a template and placed behind the wet gel to 
visualise the radiolabeled DNA. Cross-linked DNA as well as untreated
control DNA was excised from the gel (ca. 0.5 cm x 1.0 cm gel slices, except 
for controls which were roughly 1.0 cm x 2.0 cm. ). Gel slices were crushed 
and placed in 1.5 ml microfuge tubes containing 1.0 ml of DNA elution 
buffer. The gel slices containing DNA were vigorously mixed by vortex and 
incubated overnight at 37° C prior to desalting with Sep Pak C-18 columns 
as described for purification of unlabeled DNA.
118
All desalted DNA samples were Cerenkov counted using a Beckman LS1800 
liquid scintillation counter. Cross-linked and alkylated DNA samples were 
counted as dry pellets. Control untreated samples were resuspended in 50 pi 
of 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and a 5 p i aliquot was removed and counted for 
radioactivity.
3 .2 .7 . C hem ical C leavage R eactions
3.2.7.1. Guanine specific sequencing reactions
The guanine specific sequencing reaction was carried out on a 5 pi aliquot
of the control end labeled, gel purified DNA. The reaction was carried out 
in 200 pi of 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 in a 1.5 ml screw cap microfuge tube. In 
a fume hood, 1  pi of dimethyl sulphate was added to the DNA sample and the 
samples were incubated for 10 min at 25° C. The reaction was stopped by 
addition of 100 pi of 7.5 M ammonium acetate and 1  pi of (10 mg/ml) yeast 
tRNA. The DNA was then ethanol precipitated and the supernatant 
inactivated by combining it with 0.5 M NaOH. The DNA pellet was dried 
briefly under vacuum prior to adding 100 pi of freshly diluted 10% (1.0 M) 
aqueous piperidine. The solution was heated to 90° C in a tightly sealed 
microfuge tube for 30 min. During the course of these studies it was noted 
that piperidine reactions carried out in snap-cap microfuge tubes were less 
than ideal for this step in the procedure. This was thought to be due to the 
escape of the volatile piperidine component at elevated temperatures 
through incomplete sealing of the snap-cap microfuge tube which resulted
in the incomplete strand cleavage at guanine residues. This inefficient 
piperidine cleavage resulted in "shadowing” bands migrating close to and
with a slightly higher apparent molecular weight than efficiently cleaved
119
guanine fragments upon separation of the sequencing products in a 
denaturing sequencing gel. The use of tightly sealed screw capped 
microfuge tubes during the piperidine step was found to eliminate these 
shadowing secondary bands. The hot piperidine solution was immersed 
into a dry ice/ethanol bath and subsequently lyophilized. The DNA pellet
was resuspended in 15 pi of distilled deionised water and re-lyophilized.
This step was repeated once more to remove any last traces of piperidine.
3.2.7.2. Hvdroxvl radical chemical cleavage reactions
Non specific hydroxyl radical cleavage reactions were performed using 7 pi
of the gel purified, end labeled DNA in 5 mM Tris, pH 7.5. Reactions were 
carried out in 10 p i of 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.05 mM
Fe(NH4>2(SO4)/0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM H 2O2, and 1  mM sodium ascorbate. A lOx 
solution of iron(II)/EDTA was prepared immediately before use by 
combining equal volumes of 1  mM Fe(NH 4)2(S 0 4)« 6(H 2 0) and 2 mM EDTA.
Iron (II) solutions will oxidise to iron (III) in aerated solutions and should 
be discarded if an orange colour is observed. All stock solutions were
prepared immediately before use. The iron(II)/EDTA solution (1 pi), 100 
mM H 2O 2 (1 pi), and 10 mM sodium ascorbate (1 pi) were added separately to 
the walls of the microfuge tube containing the DNA sample. The reaction
was initiated by a brief centrifugation step and the sample was incubated
for 1  minute at 20° C. The reaction was terminated by immersing the
sample in a dry ice/ethanol bath and lyophilized.
3.2.7.3. Piperidine treatment of cross-linked and alkylated DNA
All purified cross-linked DNA samples were resuspended in 100 p i of
freshly diluted 10% aqueous piperidine and heated to 90° C for 15 minutes to
120
quantitatively convert sites of guanine-N7 alkylation to strand breaks 
(Mattes et al., 1986b). The samples were briefly centrifuged, immersed in a
dry ice ethanol bath and lyophilized. The DNA resuspended in 15 p.1 of 
distilled deionised water and re-lyophilized. This procedure was repeated 
once more to remove any traces of piperidine.
Identical treatments were carried out on alkylated DNA samples removed 
from the drug-DNA reaction mixtures prior to separation of the reaction 
products.
3.2.8. Electrophoresis of Fragmentation products
DNA samples treated with dimethyl sulphate were resuspended in 
electrophoresis loading at a concentration of approximately 8.0 x 10^ 
cpm/p.1. Products resulting from hydroxyl radical cleavage and piperidine 
treated cross-linked DNA samples were resuspended in loading buffer at 
approximately 2.0 x 10"* c p m /p l and 2.0 x 10^ cpm /pl respectively. All
samples were heated to 90° C for 2 minutes prior to immersion in an 
ice/water bath. Equal volumes of each sample (5 |il) were loaded into a 20% 
denaturing sequencing gel and electrophoresed at 3000 V until the xylene 
cyanol dye front had migrated approximately 15 cm. Following 
electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a piece of processed film and 
exposed to autoradiographic film overnight at -70° C.
3.2.9. Scintillation counting
Bands excised from the sequencing gel containing both native and cross- 
linked DNA were placed into a 1.5 ml microfuge tube which was then placed
121
into a 20 ml scintillation vial. The Samples were counted in a Beckman 
L S I00 liquid scintillation counter.
3.2.10. Densitometry
A utoradiographs were scanned using a Pharm acia LKB enhanced 
Ultrascan-XL laser densitometer and plots were normalised to the highest 
absorbance value in each lane.

result of reactions carried out at 37° C. Duplexes were treated with 1  mM
HN2 for 0.5 hr (lane 2); 1  hr (lane 3); 2 hr (lane 4) and 6hr (lane 5). Lane 7

the gel compared to unmodified DNA and DNA containing monoadducts. 
Mechlorethamine was found to preferentially cross-link the DNA duplex 
containing the 5 -GNC sequence (duplex D). An increasing amount of 
cross-linked product was observed with time upon reaction of HN2 with
duplex D although a low level of cross-linking could also be detected with 
duplexes A and B at elevated temperature (lane 6, figure 3.2). High doses of
drug (1 mM) were required due to the fact that the efficiency of cross-
linking in short oligomers was extremely inefficient. No cross-link
products were observed upon reaction of 1  mM melphalan with duplexes A- 
D after 6 hr at 20° C.
3.3.2. DZQ and MeDZQ
A 23 base pair duplex oligonucleotide (M l, figure 3.3) labeled either on the 
top strand (duplex I) or the bottom strand (duplex II) was treated with DZQ 
and MeDZQ for 2 h at 37° C under reducing or non-reducing conditions as 
described in m aterials and methods. Product m ixtures were ethanol 
precipitated and analysed using 20% denaturing PAGE. Figure 3.4 shows 
several cross-linked products o f different electrophoretic m obilities 
produced upon treatment of I and II with DZQ and MeDZQ. No cross-linked 
products could be detected for unreduced MeDZQ under these conditions 
(data not shown). Cross-linked products, numbered in order of migration, 
were excised from the gel and the relative amount of DNA in each band was 
determined by Cerenkov counting (Table 1). Cross-linked DNA constituted 
less than 1% of total DNA in each reaction mixture. Cross-linked DNAs were 
treated with piperidine for 15 minutes at 90° C to quantitatively cleave at 
sites of guanine-N7 alkylation. The resulting fragments were separated 
using 20% denaturing PAGE (figure 3.5 A,B) and

No trace of the initial cross-linked product could be detected after aqueous 
piperidine treatment suggesting the drug was covalently linked between 
two guanine-N7 positions on opposite strands of the DNA duplex. The 
position of guanine-N7 alkylation on cross-linked DNA was determined by 
comparison with guanine specific chemical cleavage of the corresponding 
singly end-labeled, unmodified DNA (figures 3.5 and 3.6, G lanes). To 
determine the site of cross-linking for each drug treatment, fragmentation 
patterns generated from duplex I cross-linked DNAs were compared to 
duplex II cross-linked DNAs of corresponding electrophoretic mobility.

In order to assess the guanine-N7 sequence specificity of total alkylations, 
a fraction of the drug treated DNA samples was:, removed from the reaction 
mixture prior to separation of the reaction products and treated with 
piperidine. The resulting fragm entation patterns were therefore 
representative of both monoalkylated and cross-linked DNA (figures 3.5 
and 3.6, T lanes).
Figure 3.4 shows that each drug treatment produced significant levels of a 
cross-linked product m igrating with increased electrophoretic m obility 
through the sequencing gel (band 1  DNAs). In general, piperidine 
treatm ent of cross-linked DNAs migrating in band 1  resulted in the 
cleavage of guanines located at or near the ends of the cross-linked duplex. 
For example, reaction of unreduced DZQ with M l at neutral pH produced two 
cross-linked products of different electrophoretic m obility (figure 3.4,
128
bands 1  and 2). Piperidine treatment of DNA in band 1  produced fragments 
resulting from cleavage of G3, G20, and G2I on duplex I and G2' and G21' on 
duplex II (figures 3.5 A,B and 3.6A). Similar fragmentation patterns were 
observed for band 1  DNAs in the other drug treatments. The structure of 
these cross-linked products is not well understood and although their 
significance cannot be discounted, previous studies have demonstrated that 
cross-linked DNA duplexes m igrating with maximum electrophoretic 
mobility are terminally cross-linked and are therefore not representative 
of the double stranded portion of the DNA duplex (Wcidner et. al., 1990;
Millard et. al., 1991).
For the case of unreduced DZQ, piperidine treatment of cross-linked DNA 
migrating in band 2 revealed almost exclusive alkylation of G15 on duplex I
and GIG' on duplex II suggesting a dG to dG DNA interstrand cross-link at
the 5 -GC sequence (figures 3.5 A,B and 3.6 A).

However, reduction of DZQ to the hydroquinone produced 3 distinct cross- 
linked products of different electrophoretic m obility (figure 3.4). 
Piperidine treatment of the cross-linked DNA in band 3 showed alkylation 
of G15 on duplex I and G8’  and GIO' on duplex II (figures 3.5 A,B and 3.6B).
A similar piperidine fragmentation pattern was observed for cross-linked 
DNA in band 2. The sequence preference for the formation of the DNA 
cross-link in bands 2 and 3 is not immediately clear due to the presence of 
more than one fragment from duplex II (G8' and GIO'). However, it is 
possible that the position of the cross-link may differ from one duplex to 
the next with a proportion of the DNA cross-linked through the 5 -GC 
sequence (G15 through GIO') and the remaining DNA cross-linked through 
the 5'-GNNC sequence (G15 through G8').
In contrast to reduced DZQ, reaction of reduced MeDZQ with M l produced 
only two cross-linked products of different electrophoretic mobility.
Fragmentation of the cross-linked DNA in band 2 produced almost exclusive 
alkylation of GIO on duplex I and G 14' on duplex II suggesting a dG to dG 
cross-link in a 5'-GNC sequence (figure 3.5 A,B and 3.6C). Thus reduced 
MeDZQ cross-links the 5'-GNC sequence in M l, a preference that is not 
observed with reduced DZQ.
Analysis of total alkylations (both cross-links and monoadducts) showed 
that unreduced DZQ exhibited relatively little preferential alkylation of 
guanine-N7 positions on duplexes I and II (figure 3.5 A,B and 3.6A). 
However, reduction of DZQ to the hydroquinone by DT-Diaphorase produced 
strong preferential alkylation of G15 on duplex I and GIO' on duplex II. In 
contrast, relatively non-specific guanine-N7 alkylation was observed upon 
reduction of MeDZQ. Figures 3.5A and B (T lanes) show substantial amounts
135
of full length single stranded DNA indicating that many duplexes are not 
alkylated and that most strands contain only one alkylation.
Fragmentation patterns produced from all cross-linked DNA duplexes were 
analysed by linear densitometry and shown in figure 3.6A-C. In general,
cross-linked DNAs of different electrophoretic mobility displayed unique 
fragmentation patterns upon treatment with piperidine. Interestingly,
preferential alkylation of guanines located in 5'-TGC sequences (G15, G8' 
and GIO') was observed for each DNA duplex cross-linked by the reduced
form of DZQ (figure 3.6B). This effect was not detected for either unreduced
DZQ or reduced MeDZQ. In addition, DNA cross-linked by reduced DZQ and 
migrating in bands 2 and 3 produced two fragments upon piperidine
treatment of duplex II (figure 3.6B). Since it was not clear whether Ml was
cross-linked at the 5 -GC sequence or the 5'-GNNC sequence or both, a
second duplex oligonucleotide was synthesised (M2) in which these two
sequences were separated by several nucleotides within the central portion 
of the duplex (figure 3.7)
Duplex M2, labeled either on the top strand (duplex I) or the bottom strand 
(duplex II), was reacted with DZQ and MeDZQ in the presence or absence of 
NADH and DT-Diaphorase for 2 hours at 37° C. The reaction products were 
ethanol precipitated and separated through a 20% denaturing sequencing 
gel. Figure 3.8 shows several cross-linked products of different 
electrophoretic mobilities were produced upon reaction of DZQ and MeDZQ 
with M2. These cross-linked products, numbered in order of migration, 
were excised from the gel and the relative amount of DNA in each band was 
determined Cerenkov counting (table 2). Cross-linked products were 
treated with piperidine and the resulting fragments were separated using 
20% denaturing sequencing gel electrophoresis(figure 3.9).

Band 2 was one of the principe) cross-linked products resulting from the 
reaction of unreduced DZQ with I and II (figure 3.8, table 2). Fragmentation 
of the cross-linked DNA migrating in band 2 revealed almost exclusive 
alkylation of 04 on duplex I and 018' on duplex II indicating a cross-link at 
the 5 -ONC sequence (figure 3.9). However, upon reduction of DZQ to the 
hydroquinone, a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the major 
cross-linked products was observed (bands 3 and 4, figure 3.8). Close 
examination of the autoradiograph revealed that band 3 was comprised of a 
number of closely spaced bands while band 4 was the major cross-linked 
product and migrated as a single band through the gel. Piperidine 
cleavage of the cross-linked DNA in band 4 showed extensive alkylation of

(band 2) showed a clear majority of alkylations at G4 and G 18’  implicating 
cross-link formation at the 5 -GNC site within the sequence (figures 3.9)
As with M l, the total alkylation products formed upon reaction of 
unreduced DZQ with M2 showed little preferential alkylation of guanines on 
either I or II (figures 3.9). However, upon reduction of DZQ to the 
hydroquinone form a strong preferential alkylation of GIO and G13’  was 
observed. No such preferential alkylation of guanines was detected with 
reduced MeDZQ. Significant amounts of the single stranded DNA remained 
intact upon treatm ent of alkylated DNA with piperidine (figure 3.9) 
indicating that a majority of the DNA molecules were not alkylated.

The fragm entation patterns produced by all cross-linked DNAs were 
analysed by linear densitometry and compared in figure 3.10A-C. As 
observed with M l, cross-linked DNAs of different electrophoretic mobility 
displayed unique fragmentation patterns upon piperidine treatment. Those 
cross-linked DNAs having increased mobility through a denaturing gel 
(band 1  DNAs) showed prominent alkylations at guanines near the ends of 
the duplex while cross-linked DNA having dim inished electrophoretic 
mobility (bands 4 and 5 DNAs) displayed alkylations from centrally located 
guanines. The occurrence of more than one fragment upon treatment of 
some fractio n s of cross-linked DNAs w ith p iperidine indicates 
heterogeneity with respect to the position of the guanine alkylation and 
thus precludes the exact assignment of the cross-link site. This is 
particularly evident in DNA duplexes cross-linked by reduced DZQ where 
alkylations at GIO and 013’  are present in all cross-linked DNAs and may be 
a result of the strong preferential alkylation at 5'-TGC sites. In addition, 
complex fragmentation patterns could result in more than one cross-linked 
product with the same migration through the denaturing polyacrylamide 
gel. Nevertheless, analysis of the alkylation patterns produced by less 
abundant cross-linked products clearly indicated that unreduced DZQ could 
produce a cross-link at the 5 -GC site (band 5, figure 3.10A) but in a lower 
yield. More interestingly, however was the finding that unreduced DZQ 
(band 4, figure 3.10A) and reduced MeDZQ (band 3, figure 3.IOC) exhibited 
significant alkylation of G14 and G7' suggesting the formation of a cross­
link across four base pairs at the 5 -GNNC sequence.

The distribution and reproducibility of cross-linked products induced in M2 
by DZQ and MeDZQ was investigated in more detail by extended
electrophoretic separation of the drug-DNA reaction mixtures as shown
in figure 3.11. Although the basic distribution of major cross-linked 
products was retained, the resolution of many more bands was detected.
For example, reduction of DZQ from the quinone to the hydroquinone 
altered the electrophoretic mobility of the major cross-linked product to a 
single band migrating with a much diminished mobility. However, DNA
cross-linked by reduced DZQ and migrating in band 3 (shown in figure 3.8) 
was resolved into several closely m igrating bands upon extended
electrophoresis (figure 3.11). Similarly, DNA cross-linked by reduced DZQ 
and migrating in band 2 (figure 3.8, DZQ+) could be separated into two
bands. The relative amount of cross-linked DNA in each band,
corresponding to the position of those bands in figure 3.8, was determined
by densitometry of the autoradiograph. These values were combined with 
the values in table 2 and presented in table 3. It should be noted that cross- 
linked DNAs from the gel in figure 3.11 were not characterised by
piperidine fragm entation analysis.
The sequence preferences for the formation of DNA cross-links induced by
DZQ and MeDZQ were also investigated in synthetic duplex oligonucleotides 
containing a single potential cross-linking site (figure 3.1). Figure 3.12 
shows the separation of products generated from the reaction of DZQ and 
MeDZQ with oligomers B, C and D. Unreduced DZQ produced a cross-linked 
product in the 5 -GNC containing oligomer (D) but not in the 5'-CG (B) or 
the 5 -GC (C) containing duplexes. However, reduction of DZQ to the 
hydroquinone produced a cross-linked product in the 5 -GC duplex (C) and
also to a lesser extent in the 5 -GNC containing duplex (D). Cross-linking

could only be detected upon reaction of MeDZQ with duplex D (5'-GNC) under 
reducing conditions.
M oreover, unreduced DZQ preferentially cross-linked the 5'-GNC 
containing duplex while reduction of DZQ to the hydroquinone produced
preferential cross-linking at the 5 -GC containing duplex although a lower 
level of cross-linking could also be detected in the 5 -GNC containing
duplex. In contrast, the reduced form of MeDZQ could only produce cross­
links across the 5 -GNC containing duplex. These data are consistent with 
preferential cross-link formation induced in the 23 base pair duplex 
oligonucleotides containing several cross-linking sites.
3.4. Discussion
Reaction of mechlorethamine with a panel of duplex oligonucleotides 
containing single potential cross-linking sites was found to result in 
preferential cross-link formation in a DNA duplex containing a 5 -GNC 
sequence. In addition, a low level of cross-linking could also be detected in 
the duplex containing a 5-C G  sequence (figure 3.2). These results are 
consistent with the findings of other workers who have reported that 
m echloretham ine preferentially cross-linked duplex oligonucleotides 
containing a 5 -GNC sequence (M illard et. al., 1990). It was also 
dem onstrated that although the 5 -GNC containing duplex was 
preferentially cross-linked, it was not the sole site for nitrogen mustard
induced DNA cross-links (Millard et. al., 1990). In a related study, 
p ip e rid in e  frag m en tatio n  o f a n itro g en  m ustard cro ss-lin k ed
oligonucleotide showed that 44% of DNA duplexes were cross-linked at a 5'- 
GNC sequence while only 2% and 8% were cross-linked at 5 -GC and 5 -CG 
sequences respectively (Hopkins et. al., 1991). It was demonstrated that the 
conversion of monoadducts to cross-links was much more efficient at 5'-
151
GNC sites than at 5 -GC sites and that this may account for the preferential 
cross-linking observed with nitrogen mustard. In a separate study, a 
duplex oligonucleotide containing a nitrogen m ustard cross-link was 
purified by denaturing PAGE and shown to be cross-linked through 
guanine N7 positions in a 5 -GNC sequence (Ojwang et. al., 1989). In the 
present study, a low level of cross-linking was also observed upon reaction 
of nitrogen mustard with a DNA duplex in which only one strand contained 
a guanine (duplex A, and 3.2). The structure of this cross-linked product is 
not known and is as yet uncharacterised.
The appearance of two closely spaced cross-linked product bands generated 
from the reaction of nitrogen mustard with duplex D (figure 3.2) was 
unexpected due to the fact that there is only one potential cross-linking 
site within the duplex containing guanine residues (e.g. 5 -GNC, duplex D). 
However, previous studies have proposed that the differential migration of 
duplexes cross-linked through guanine-N7 positions may be due in part to 
the formation of FAPY imidazole ring opened products (Ojwang et. al., 1989). 
It was found that heating a cross-linked DNA duplex oligonucleotide at 37° C 
in the presence of dilute alkali stabilised the cross-link by forming a FAPY 
ring opened product. However, the ring opened products, although more 
stable, were electrophoretic ally distinct from the ring closed species since 
FAPY adducts exist as a mixture of structural and rotational isomers (Ojwang 
et. al., 1989).
The finding that nitrogen m ustard preferentially cross-links duplex 
oligonucleotides in a 5 -GNC sequence was not predicted from molecular 
modelling studies. The limited molecular reach of nitrogen mustard when 
fully extended (7.5 Â) was anticipated to form cross-links between guanines 
located in 5-G C  sequences in which the spanned distance between
152
guanines on opposing strands is 7.7 A in B-DNA, (Brooks and Lawley, 1961;
Kohn et. al., 1987; Ojwang et. al., 1989(Amott et al., 1974). Although other 
factors such as the structure of the transition state involved in cross-link 
formation, flanking base sequence, and conformation of DNA are likely to 
influence cross-link formation, the preference for nitrogen mustard to 
form cross-links at 5 -GNC sequences appears to be general (Hopkins et. al.,
1991; Ojwang et. al., 1989; Millard et. al., 1990).
The reaction of DZQ and MeDZQ with duplex oligonucleotides containing 
several potential cross-linking sites resulted in the formation of a number 
of cross-linked products with different electrophoretic m obilities. 
Reduction of DZQ from the quinone to the hydroquinone form by DT- 
Diaphorase was found to alter both the extent and distribution of cross- 
linked products. Analysis of purified cross-linked DNA products by 
piperidine fragmentation indicated that reduction of DZQ alters the 
sequence preference for interstrand cross-link form ation betw een 
guanine-N7 positions from a 5 -GNC to a 5 -GC site. In contrast, the reduced 
form of MeDZQ was shown to preferentially cross-link DNA at 5 -GNC sites.
These results, which were confirmed in oligomers containing single sites, 
lend support to m olecular m odelling studies that have suggested 
intercalation of the hydroquinone form of DZQ at 5 -GC sites is facilitated by 
hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl groups with the 02 and C4-NH2 groups 
of cytosine. This orientation allows the reactive aziridine carbon atoms to 
be in a favourable position above the plane of the aromatic ring for 
covalent bond formation to the guanine-N7 position (Hartley et al., 1991a). 
Stabilisation of the intercalated hydroquinone may account for the 
preferential m onoalkylation of guanines in 5 -G C  sequences and 
subsequent cross-link formation at these sites. Indeed, as was demonstrated 
for nitrogen mustard, the efficiency of the conversion of monoadducts to
153
cross-links may influence to a large extent the sequence specificity for 
cross-link formation. In addition, previous studies have suggested that 
preferential cross-link formation takes place at locations that will result in 
the minimum distortion of B-DNA (Hopkins et al., 1991).
A general feature of the present study was the finding that cross-linked 
DNAs of different electrophoretic m obility resulted in unique 
fragmentation patterns upon treatment with aqueous piperidine. Cross- 
linked DNA migrating with increased mobility through a sequencing gel 
showed alkylation of guanines at or near the ends of the duplex. These 
results are consistent with the findings of Weidner et. al., (1991) in which 
the mobility of synthetic DNA oligomers cross-linked by mitomycin C 
analogues was shown to be related to the position of the cross-link from the 
terminal 5' phosphate group. Using a Fe/EDTA fragmentation protocol it 
was demonstrated that cross-linked DNA migrating with a diminished 
mobility through a denaturing sequencing gel was cross-linked near the 
middle of the duplex while terminally cross-linked DNA migrated with an 
increased mobility (Weidner et. al., 1991). Later studies confirmed that the 
mobility of cross-linked DNA increased as the position of the cross-link was 
moved toward either end of the duplex (Millard et. al., 1991). It was 
hypothesised that the reactivity of residues at the ends of duplex 
oligonucleotides is higher than in duplex regions. For this reason, 
terminally cross-linked DNAs were discounted as not being representative 
of cross-linking reactions taking place in the double stranded region of 
DNA.
Reaction of & quinone form of DZQ with duplex M l produced two cross-linked 
products with different electrophoretic mobility (figure 3.4). Analysis of 
the cross-linked products by piperidine fragmentation showed that 12% of
154
the cross-links in Ml DNA were located at the 5-GC sequence (band 2) with 
the remaining DNA apparently terminally cross-linked (figure 3.6A). In 
contrast, reaction of the hydroquinone form of DZQ with M l resulted in 
three electrophoretically distinct cross-linked products (figure 3.4). 
Piperidine treatment of the non-terminally cross-linked DNA, band 2 (28%) 
and band 3 (34%), produced a similar fragmentation pattern to that of 
unreduced DZQ with the exception of an additional alkylation at 08' (figure 
3.6B). The appearance of tW  or more fragments resulting from piperidine 
treatment of singly end-labeled cross-linked DNA indicates heterogeneity 
with respect to the position of alkylation and precludes the exact 
assignment of a cross-link site.
One possible explanation for the pattern obtained for non-terminal cross­
links induced in M l DNA by reduced DZQ (band 3, figure 3.6B) is that a 
fraction of the DNA duplexes are cross-linked at the 5 -GC sequence while 
the remaining fraction are cross-linked at the 5'-GNNC sequence. An 
equally feasible possibility is that this pattern arises from a population of 
DNAs which are all cross-linked at the 5-GC sequence but in which a 
fraction of these cross-linked molecules contain a monoalkylation at G8'. If 
the former explanation is also true for band 2 DNA (i.e. 5 -GC + 5'-GNNC 
cross-links), then it is not immediately clear why the cross-linked DNA in 
band 2 migrates with a different electrophoretic mobility from the cross- 
linked DNA in band 3, since DNA cross-linked at the same sequence would 
presumably have the same electrophoretic mobility. It is not unreasonable 
to assume that some M l DNA molecules cross-linked by reduced DZQ (in 
band 3) could contain accompanying monoalkylations given that G8' and 
in particular GIO' are preferred sites for monoalkylation. In addition, 
alkylations at G8' and GIO' are present in all DNAs cross-linked by reduced 
DZQ (figure 3.6 B). Although the site of non-terminal cross-links induced
155
in Ml DNA by reduced DZQ could not be determined with any degree of 
certainty, it was clear that either a 5-GC or a 5'-GNNC cross-link was 
involved.
In contrast to reduced DZQ, reduction of MeDZQ to the hydroquinone form 
produced two electrophoretically distinct cross-linked products in M l DNA 
(figure 3.4). Fragmentation of band 2 DNA resulted in almost exclusive 
alkylation of GIO and G14' indicating a cross-link in a 5 -GNC sequence.
Thus it became clear that the two structurally similar compounds, DZQ and 
MeDZQ, preferentially cross-linked duplex M l at different sites within the 
same DNA sequence.
In order to define more precisely the nature of the interstrand cross-link 
formed by reduced DZQ and MeDZQ in DNA, a second duplex oligonucleotide
(M2) was designed so that the 5 -GNC, 5 -GC and 5'-GNNC sites were separated
within the duplex portion of the molecule. Reaction of unreduced DZQ with 
M2 produced a number of electrophoretically distinct cross-linked products 
(figure 3.8). The sequence preference for the formation of non-terminally
cross-linked DNAs induced by unreduced DZQ was 5 -GNC > 5'-GC > S'-GNNC as 
shown in table 3. However, upon reduction of DZQ to the hydroquinone by 
DT-diaphorase, a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the major 
cross-linked products (bands 3 and 4, figure 3.8) was observed. Although a 
similar level of cross-linked product was detected in band 3 and band 4 
(table 2), extended electrophoretic separation of the cross-linked products 
revealed band 3 to consist of a number of closely migrating bands while 
band 4 remained intact and constituted the major product. Piperidine 
cleavage of the cross-linked DNA in band 4 clearly indicated a cross-link at 
the 5-GC sequence. As with M l, reduction of DZQ to the hydroquinone 
significantly enhanced total alkylation of guanines at 5 -TGC sequences
156
and has been observed previously (Hartley et. al., 1991). It is interesting to 
note that GIO and 013', both at 5'-TGC sites, are alkylated in all M2 DNAs 
cross-linked by reduced DZQ (figure 3.10, bands 1-4). In contrast to reduced 
DZQ, reduced MeDZQ preferentially cross-linked DNA at the 5 -GNC sequence.
Although the nucleotide sequence preferences for the formation of cross­
links induced in M2 generally support the findings in M l, there were some 
important differences. For example, the two major products formed upon 
reaction of unreduced DZQ with M2 (bands 2 and 3) showed cross-linking at 
the 5 -GNC sequence. In contrast, no 5 -GNC cross-links were detected in Ml 
even though M l contains two 5-GNC sequences. The reason for this 
apparent disparity is not clear. It is possible that since duplex Ml is not 
blunt ended, the 5' overhanging end may serve as a particularly accessible 
site for alkylation and cross-linking. This is especially evident for G2* in 
band 2 of M l (figure 3.6A). Another contributing factor to the lack of 5'- 
GNC cross-links in Ml may be due to the fact that the reaction with 
unreduced DZQ was carried out at neutral pH while the reaction with M2 
was performed at pH 5.8.
In order to confirm the nucleotide sequence specificity for cross-linking,
DZQ and MeDZQ were reacted with duplex oligonucleotides containing a 
single potential cross-linking site. Results showed that unreduced DZQ 
preferentially cross-linked the 5'GNC containing oligomer while reduced 
DZQ preferentially cross-linked across the 5 -GC sequence with some cross- 
linking detected in the 5 -GNC sequence, although to a lesser extent. In 
addition, cross-linking was only observed for MeDZQ+ in the duplex 
containing the 5-GNC site (figure 3.12).
157
A limiting factor involved in using piperidine fragmentation of cross- 
linked DNA to determine cross-linking specificity is that only compounds 
reacting at the N7-position of guanine can be evaluated. In addition, the 
dose of cross-linking agent must be carefully selected so that so called 
"single hit" kinetics are achieved in which a majority of labeled DNA 
strands are not alkylated. Another weakness of piperidine cleavage of 
cross-linked DNA is that the presence of more than one fragment produced 
from a cross-linked DNA molecule complicates the interpretation of the site 
of cross-linking. The strengths of the method include the ability to 
evaluate even minor products of a cross-linking reaction and to evaluate 
the pattern of guanine-N7 alkylation of cross-linked DNA in detail. For 
example, analysis of the minor cross-linked products using non-specific 
hydroxyl radical chemical cleavage (Fe/EDTA) is difficult due to the 
extreme inefficiency of the cleavage reaction. In contrast, piperidine 
cleavage is quantitative for DNA cross-linked through guanine-N7 
positions. In addition, the presence of monoadducts on cross-linked DNA 
molecules may be overlooked using Fe/EDTA chemical cleavage since 
fragments produced are diagnostic only for the cross-link. The use of 
oligonucleotides containing a number of cross-linking sites has the 
advantage over single site oligomers in that the cross-linking preferences 
of a single drug can be compared within the same DNA sequence. 
N evertheless, single site oligonucleotides together with oligom ers 
containing a number of potential cross-linking sites can be used to 
effectively elucidate the nucleotide preference for the formation of DNA 
cro ss-lin k s.
The DNA interstrand cross-linking sequence specificity of a number of 
bifunctional alkylating agents has been investigated in other laboratories.
It has been shown that reductively activated mitomycin C cross-links were
158
formed predominantly at 5-C G  sites, while cisplatin was found to 
preferentially cross-link guanines at 5-G C  sequences using an 
Fe(II)/EDTA/hydrogen peroxide/ascorbic acid analysis (Hopkins et al.,
1991). In the present study, the unreduced form of DZQ and the reduced 
form of MeDZQ were found to preferentially cross-link at the 5 -GNC site of 
a duplex oligonucleotide in a manner similar to that of mechlorethamine. 
However, the cross-link distance in DZQ and MeDZQ is much greater (10 
atoms) than in mechlorethamine which allows the formation of cross-links 
spanning four base pairs in a 5'-GNNC sequence which is not observed with 
cisplatin or mitomycin C. A low level of crosslinking at a 5'-GNNC sequence 
has been suggested for mechlorethamine (Hopkins et. al., 1991)
Clearly, reduction of DZQ to the hydroquinone by DT-Diaphorase results not 
only in an altered sequence preference for guanine-N7 monoalkylations 
but also influences the ultimate formation of DNA interstrand cross-links 
between guanine-N7 sites. This is not the case with other 2,5-diaziridinyl- 
1,4-benzoquinones which contain more bulky side groups in the 3 and 6 
positions. It is not clear whether the properties of DZQ would be maintained 
if one side group remains as hydrogen while the other is modified. 
Compounds of this type would have the advantage that, depending on the 
structure of the side groups, the redox capability of the quinone, and hence 
the ease of form ation of the hydroquinone, could be m odified. 
Alternatively the DZQ molecule could be attached to sequence specific 
ligands to produce alkylating agents with enhanced or altered sequence 
selectivities. Nonsymmetrical compounds of both types are currently 
being investigated.

CHAPTER 4. GENERAL DISCUSSION
Bifunctional alkylating agents play a critical role in the effective 
treatment of human cancer and efforts continue to be made toward 
understanding their mechanism of action at the molecular level. It has 
become increasingly clear in recent years that DNA is the relevant cellular 
target for these agents and that cytotoxicity has often been correlated with 
the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links. A basic understanding of the 
biochemical nature of drug-DNA interactions has generated considerable 
interest in the development of new cross-linking compounds together with 
agents capable of reacting with DNA in a sequence specific manner.
The studies outlined in the first part of this thesis describe a simple, 
sensitive and rapid agarose gel based assay for measuring the formation of 
DNA interstrand cross-links. In addition to measuring the extent and rate 
of cross-link formation, the technique can be extended to measure the rate 
at which DNA monoadducts are converted to interstrand cross-links. The 
assay is particularly well suited for evaluating the effect of structure on 
the ability of a given agent to cross-link DNA. In these studies a number of 
structurally diverse bifunctional agents have been evaluated for their 
ability to produce cross-links in isolated DNA.
For the nitrogen mustard compounds, both the extent and rate of DNA 
cross-linking was found to be influenced to a large extent by the nature of 
the group attached to the reactive portion of the molecule. The rate of DNA 
cross-link formation at equimolar concentration was mechlorethamine > 
uracil mustard > melphalan > phosphoramide mustard > isophosphoramide 
mustard. Previous studies have examined the kinetics of DNA interstrand
160
cross-link formation induced in L1210 cells by several nitrogen mustard 
compounds using the technique of alkaline elution. It was recently shown 
that nitrogen mustard produced the highest initial level of DNA interstrand 
cross-links immediately after a 30 minute incubation followed by uracil 
mustard and melphalan (O'Connor et. al., 1990). In addition, the production 
of DNA interstrand cross-links, expressed either as the kinetics of
formation or area under the curve, could be correlated with loss of colony 
forming ability while DNA protein cross-link formation and strand break 
production could not. In a separate study, a comparison between DNA
cross-linking ability and cytotoxicity induced in LS174T human colonic 
adenocarcinoma and leukaemic K562 cells by melphalan, chlorambucil, and 
4[bis(2-chloroethyl) aminojbenzoic acid was carried out (Sunters et al.,
1992). The results showed that the ranking order of cytotoxicities could be 
correlated with the ability of each compound to form cross-links in isolated 
DNA using the agarose gel based technique. This was different than that
predicted by the rate of hydrolysis of the compounds, a factor which was 
previously used as a crude predictor of biological activity for aromatic 
nitrogen mustards (Bardos et al., 1965).
With the agarose gel based assay, it was possible to measure an increase in 
DNA cross-links induced by uracil mustard and melphalan after removal of 
unbound drug while no such increase was observed with nitrogen mustard.
In alkaline elution studies, very little additional increase in cross-linking 
could be detected in the DNA of L I210 cells treated with nitrogen mustard
after removal of the drug from the culture media (Ross et al., 1978). In 
contrast, a significant increase in melphalan induced DNA cross-links was
observed up to 6 hours after drug removal. Although differential kinetics
of cross-link formation might be attributed to differences in the rate of
repair of nitrogen mustard and melphalan cross-links, results presented in
161
this thesis indicate that an increase in cross-linking over time in the 
absence of unbound drug is due to the rate of second arm cross-link 
formation which is also likely to occur in the DNA of intact cells. In 
addition, delayed cross-linking has also been observed in the DNA of L1210 
cells treated with CCNU and BCNU (Erickson et al., 1980b; Ewig & Kohn,
1978).
The clinically useful platinum coordination compounds cisplatin and 
carboplatin also displayed significant differences in the extent and rate of 
DNA cross-link formation. In addition to DNA interstrand cross-links, 
cisplatin and carboplatin are capable of forming DNA intrastrand cross­
links. The increased mobility of interstrand cross-linked DNAs at 
increasing doses of drug (see figure 2.9) may be associated with the 
formation of intrastrand cross-links in these fragments. Cisplatin at 10 p , M 
was found to cross-link 100% of DNA after 2 hr while 1000 pM carboplatin 
was required to produce an equivalent level of cross-linking. These results 
are supported by the study of Knox et al, (1986) in which it was shown that 
approximately 100 fold larger doses of carboplatin than cisplatin was 
required to produce a similar level of binding to plasmid DNA and that this 
difference could be attributed to the much faster rate of aquation of 
cisplatin. However, once cisplatin and carboplatin were bound to DNA in 
equivalent amounts, a sim ilar level of interstrand cross-links and
cytotoxicity was observed (Knox et al., 1986). In animal tumour models, 3-
to 4-fold more carboplatin than cisplatin was required to obtain an
equivalent frequency of DNA interstrand cross-links as measured by
alkaline elution. Interestingly, a 13 fold higher dose of carboplatin was 
required to achieve equitoxicity (DeNeve et al., 1990).
162
Results presented in this thesis have shown that the enzyme DT-diaphorase 
was capable of reducing a number of structurally related analogues of AZQ 
to a species capable of alkylating and cross-linking DNA. At equimolar 
concentrations, only the DZQ and BZQ analogues were capable of producing 
DNA interstrand cross-links under nonreducing conditions. All other 
quinone analogues required the presence of DT-Diaphorase before DNA 
cross-linking could be detected. In general, the level of DNA cross-linking 
observed with these agents in their reduced form decreased with an
increase in the size of the alkyl substituents at the 3 and 6 position of the 
quinone ring. In addition, following reduction with DT-diaphorase, the
level of DNA interstrand cross-links induced by DZQ and MeDZQ was 
increased to a much greater degree than that of any other quinone
including AZQ. In contrast, cross-linking was not increased with BZQ in the
presence of DT-diaphorase. Spectrophotometric analysis showed that the
absorption spectrum of DZQ and NADH in the region between 300-400 nm
remained unchanged after a fifteen minute incubation. In contrast, a
dramatic decrease in the absorption maximum of DZQ and NADH was 
observed with time upon the addition of DT-diaphorase which was taken as 
a measure of the initial rate of DZQ reduction. DZQ was the most readily 
reduced quinone in the presence of DT-diaphorase followed by MeDZQ, AZQ 
and BZQ. This rate of reduction correlated well with the increase in the 
level of DNA cross-linking observed upon reduction by DT-diaphorase. The 
finding that the level of BZQ cross-links induced in DNA was similar under 
reducing and non-reducing conditions suggests that this compound is a
poor substrate for DT-diaphorase .
In addition to enzymatic reduction, aziridinylbenzoquinones have also 
exhibited the potential to undergo chemical reduction to a species capable 
of alkylating and cross-linking DNA (Hartley et al., 1991a). Quinone
163
induced cross-linking in isolated DNA for a number of AZQ analogues at 
equim olar concentration was shown to increase upon reduction with
ascorbic acid and was pH dependent. The effect was particularly
pronounced for DZQ in which cross-linking was increased from 8% at 
neutral pH to 100% at neutral pH in the presence of 2 mM ascorbic acid. In 
contrast, cross-linking could only be detected for AZQ and its analogues at 
low pH in the presence of ascorbic acid. As with enzymatic reduction, a 
general decrease in the level of cross-linking was observed as the size of 
the substituent at the 3 and 6 position of the quinone ring increased.
Related studies have demonstrated that DZQ, upon reduction by glutathione, 
was able to inhibit the action of bacteriophage M13-DNA was shown to 
be due to reductive alkylation (Lusthof et al., 1990; Lusthof et al., 1988) 
Interestingly, DZQ was shown to form a conjugate with glutathione which 
was not associated with the aziridine ring but through a substitution 
reaction at the 3 or 6 position of the quinone ring. In contrast, AZQ did not 
form a conjugate with glutathione.
Enzymatic or chemical reduction of anitumour quinones to more reactive 
metabolites is thought to be the basis for the cytotoxic effects observed with 
these compounds (Butler & Hoey, 1987; Butler et al., 1987; Dzielendziak et 
al., 1990; Powis, 1989). Antitumour aziridinylbenzoquinones such as AZQ 
and BZQ have been used clinically despite the fact that the mechanism of
action of this class of compounds is not fully understood, Quinone
containing aziridine compounds such as AZQ have the potential to undergo 
both one and two electron reduction to form more reactive metabolites. One 
electron reduction of the quinone can lead to the formation of semiquinone 
radicals. Interaction of the semiquinone with oxygen can lead to the 
production of superoxide and other species capable of damaging DNA 
(Gutierrez, 1989). A detailed study of the relationship between the
164
reduction of AZQ analogues, DNA damage and toxicity recently demonstrated 
that DZQ was most easily reduced by DT-diaphorase followed by MeDZQ, D5,
D7, D3, D l, AZQ, D6 and D4 (figure 2.11) while BZQ was not a substrate (Gibson 
et al., 1992). Interestingly, the order of toxicity to the human HT-29 cell 
line, which is rich in DT-diaphorase, was reported to be MeDZQ followed by 
DZQ, BZQ, Dl, D5, AZQ, D7, D3, D6, and D4. In addition, the cytotoxicity induced 
by these compounds could be inhibited by dicoumarol, a known inhibitor of 
DT-diaphorase. DZQ and MeDZQ were also found to be 5-6 fold less toxic to a 
cell line deficient'^DT-diaphorase. In the same study, analysis of DNA 
damage in HT-29 cells by alkaline elution showed that DZQ induced 
primarily DNA strand breaks while MeDZQ produced DNA interstrand cross­
links. The formation of both types of lesions could be inhibited by 
dicoumarol. Dzielendziak and co-workers have also observed a correlation 
between DNA cross-linking, ease of quinone reduction and cytotoxicity in 
two human cell lines (Dzielendziak et al., 1990).
Although a single mechanism cannot account for all the observed cytotoxic 
effects of these compounds, it is clear that DNA interstrand cross-linking is 
important in this respect and that the DT-diaphorase mediated two electron 
reduction of the quinone group plays an important role in the activation of 
a number of aziridinylbenzoquinones (Gibson et al., 1992; Pacheco et al.,
1991; Ross et al., 1990; Siegel et al., 1990a), Based upon these findings,
MeDZQ would be a model compound to be tested in tumours containing high 
levels of DT-diaphorase relative to surrounding tissues, while BZQ would be 
predicted to be a good candidate for tumours lacking any detectable level of 
DT-diaphorase activity.
The pyrrolo(l,4) benzodiazepines (PBD s) are a group of antitumour 
antibiotics produced by various actinomycetes and include such compounds
165
as anthramycin and tomaymycin. The biological potency of these 
compounds is generally believed to be associated with their ability to
covalently bind to DNA (Hurley et al., 1988). The reactive species has been 
proposed to be the N lO -C ll imine form of the drug which undergoes
nucleophilic attack from the N2 position of guanine to form the minor
groove adduct covering 2 to 3 base pairs (Hertzberg et al., 1986). A study
designed to examine various PBD monofunctional analogues for their
ability to react with DNA in a sequence specific manner has revealed 
preferential binding at PuGPu sites (Hurley et al., 1988).
The C8 linked PBD compounds are a novel class of agent based on the 
naturally occurring monofunctional antitumour antibiotic DC-81. The 
bifunctional alkylating agent DSB-120, containing two DC-81 units linked 
via a 1,3-propanediyldioxy bridge, was recently synthesised in an effort to 
extend the number of base pairs recognised and thereby enhance the 
sequence preference of DC-81. Molecular modelling and NMR studies have 
shown that DSB-120 spans six base pairs and recognises a central 5 -GATC 
sequence. Cross-linking observed with DSB-120 was remarkably efficient
with 100% DNA cross-linked at doses as low as 500 nM. These results 
demonstrate that DSB-120 is 50 fold more efficient than the major groove
cross-linking agent nitrogen mustard and approximately 300 fold more 
effective than melphalan using the same assay (Hartley et al., 1991b). In 
vitro cytotoxicity data have shown that DSB-120 was up to 660 fold more 
cytotoxic to the ADJ/PC6 cell strain than the parent monofunctional agent
DC-81. DSB-120 was also between 30 and 40 fold more cytotoxic to L1210 and
K562 cells than DC-81 (Bose et al., 1992a).
In light of the cytotoxicity of DSB-120 together with its high DNA cross- 
linking efficiency, three analogues, which varied with respect to the
166
length of the methylene chain connecting the two reactive portions of the 
molecule, were synthesised and evaluated for their ability to cross-link 
DNA (Bose et. al., 1992b). The n=3 and n=5 compounds showed a similar level 
of cross-linking and were more efficient cross-linkers than the n=4 and
n=6 analogues. The striking cross-linking efficiency of these agents is 
illustrated by the fact that the least efficient of the C8-linked analogues, 
the n=4 compound, was still 20 fold more effective at cross-linking DNA 
than melphalan while the n=3 compound was 300 fold more effective than 
melphalan in this respect.
Interestingly, a correlation was observed between the efficiency of DNA
cross-linking induced by the bifunctional PBD compounds and cytotoxicity 
in a number of cell strains including the ADJ/PC6 and L1210 lines. For 
example, the n=3 analogue was 700 fold more cytotoxic than the n=4
compound and the n=5 analogue was 5 fold more cytotoxic than the n=6 
compound to the ADJ/PC6 cell line (Bose et al., 1992b). Similarly, the n=3 
and the n=5 compounds were 120 and 75 fold more cytotoxic to the L1210 cell 
line than the n=4 and n=6 analogues respectively. IC50 values in both CHI 
and K562 cell lines showed similar patterns of cytotoxicity. Although the 
n=3 and n=5 analogues were similar with respect to cross-linking 
efficiency, the increase in the helix melting temperature for the n=3
compound was reported to be nearly twice that of the n=5 analogue (Bose et 
al., 1992b). This may be due to differences in their non-covalent binding 
properties or the possibility that monoadducts or intrastrand cross-links 
influence thermal dénaturation but not the efficiency of covalent cross- 
lin k in g .
Moreover, DNA cross-linking could be evaluated for a wide range of 
bifunctional alkylating agents using an agarose gel based technique. The
167
assay provides a rapid and sensitive tool for the measurement of cross-links 
produced in isolated DNA and can serve as a basis for the comparison of 
drug-DNA cross-linking reactions in cells without the additional factors of 
drug uptake, intracellular metabolism, or DNA repair.
The second aspect of cross-linking described in this thesis was the 
nucleotide sequence preferences for the formation of DNA interstrand 
cross-links in synthetic oligonucleotides. Previous studies have utilised 
base modified synthetic oligonucleotides to examine both the carcinogenic 
and mutagenic effects of many DNA interacting drugs (Basu & Essigmann,
1988; Ferguson et al., 1989). In addition, a number of chemotherapeutic 
alkylating agents have exhibited varying degrees of DNA sequence 
specificity in relatively short fragments of DNA using variations in DNA
sequencing methodology (Hartley et al., 1986; Hartley et al., 1988a; Hartley 
et al., 1988b). However, a great majority of these studies have focused 
primarily on the specificity of DNA monoalkylation while the sequence
specificity of DNA interstrand cross-linking has been largely unexplored.
The finding that nitrogen mustard preferentially cross-links synthetic
duplex oligonucleotides in 5 -GNC sequences is consistent with the findings 
of Millard et al., (1990), and Ojwang et al.,(1989) who have also reported this 
preferential cross-linking in synthetic oligonucleotides. These results are 
not consistent with previous molecular modelling and DNA hydrolysate 
studies which have suggested preferential cross-linking across 5 -CG or 5'- 
GC sequences (Brooks & Lawley, 1961; Hausheer et al., 1989).
The sequence preference for DNA cross-linking induced by the
bioreductive agents DZQ and MeDZQ were prompted by earlier studies which 
demonstrated two important findings. The first was that the level of cross-
168
links induced in isolated DNA by DZQ and MeDZQ was increased to a much 
greater extent in the presence of DT-Diaphorase compared to other quinone 
compounds including AZQ. In addition, while the quinone and 
hydroquinone forms of several structurally similar aziridines exhibited 
relatively non-specific alkylation of guanine-N7 positions, the reduced 
form of DZQ reacted preferentially at guanines in 5 -GC sequences and more 
specifically at 5'TGC sequences (Hartley et al., 1991a; Lee et al., 1992). It was 
subsequently found that DZQ and MeDZQ preferentially cross-link at 5 -GC 
and 5-GNC sequences respectively.
Using this methodology it is possible to evaluate how subtle changes in the 
structure of a given bifunctional agent affect the sequence preferences
for DNA cross-linking. In addition, automated synthetic nucleotide 
chemistry makes it possible to study the influence of any DNA sequence, 
including the effect of flanking base sequences, on drug-DNA cross- 
linking reactions. Separation of the cross-linked product by denaturing 
PAGE can afford highly purified cross-linked products which can 
subsequently be isolated and characterised by various chemical cleavage 
reactions. The DNA sequence cross-linked by several bifunctional agents 
has now been reported using synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Hopkins et al., 1991; Weidner et al.,
1990).
Although it is not clear whether the sequence selective cross-linking
observed in synthetic duplex oligonucleotides is maintained within the cell, 
a recent study has demonstrated that the pattern of alkylation induced in
isolated DNA by a number of nitrogen mustard compounds was preserved in 
intact cells (Hartley et al., 1991c). However, a number of factors is likely 
to influence the formation, location and repair of cross-links induced in

cellular DNA. In addition to the tertiary arrangement of DNA organised
into tightly packed chromatin structures, there is evidence to suggest that 
DNA sequence influences both the conformation of the helix and biological 
function (Fujimoto & Schurr, 1990; Nielsen, 1991).
It is now becoming increasingly clear that repair of DNA damage
(including interstrand cross-links) induced in cellular DNA by chemically 
reactive compounds differs in transcriptionally active and inactive regions 
of the genome. For example, (Madhani et al., 1986) has shown that
thymidine dimers induced in cellular DNA by UV light were preferentially 
repaired in the transcriptionally active c-abl gene compared to the 
inactive c-mos gene in 3T3 fibroblasts. Vos and Hanawalt (1987) have 
demonstrated that 80% of cross-links formed in the active dihidrofolate 
reductase gene by psoralen were repaired after 24 hours while only 45% of 
monoadducts were removed (Vos & Hanawalt, 1987). Nitrogen mustard 
cross-links induced in cellular DNA also appear to be formed and repaired 
in a heterogeneous manner in the genome. These and other studies appear 
to suggest that differential repair occurs not only in different regions of 
the genome but in many instances is compound specific (Futscher et al.,
1992; Hartley et al., 1993).
Although non random DNA repair at the gene level is becoming better 
understood, much less is known about how DNA interstrand cross-links 
induced at specific sequences are processed and repaired by cellular 
enzymes. In a recent study by Van Houten (1986), a synthetic duplex DNA 
molecule containing a psoralen cross-link at a precisely defined sequence 
was purified and characterised. The cross-linked duplex was inserted into a 
long DNA fragment and subsequently subjected to the action of ABC 
excinuclease to unambiguously examine mechanism of enzymatic repair.
170
In addition, the construction of a psoralen cross-linked DNA allowed the 
determination of the contact sites between the repair enzyme and the DNA 
fragment (Van et al., 1986a; Van et al., 1986b). In a similar study, a 
synthetic duplex oligonucleotide containing a single nitrogen mustard 
cross-link was purified and ligated into a human expression vector (Ojwang 
et al., 1989). This method has the advantage of being generally applicable 
to duplex oligonucleotides cross-linked with other bifunctional agents
(Grueneberg et al., 1991). These techniques may be of particular interest 
in elucidating the repair of structurally distinct DNA cross-links as DNA
repair has been implicated as an important mechanism in drug resistance 
(Hartley et al., 1993).
A basic understanding of the mechanism by which bifunctional agents
recognise and cross-link DNA may also have important implications for the
rational design and development of antitumour agents which recognise 
specific DNA sequences. It has been suggested that certain tumours which
are extremely sensitive to cytotoxic drug action may contain essential 
genes which are unusually susceptible to damage by DNA damaging agents 
(HarVW^ et al., 1993). For example, recent studies have suggested that GC 
rich regions in genes could be preferred sites for damage by such agents as 
the nitrogen mustards and the chloroethylnitrosoureas. The human
genome contains regions of unexpectedly high GC content (>80%) 
including some oncogene sequences (Zerial et al., 1986). Both the 
nitrogen mustards and the chloroethylnitrosoureas have been shown to 
preferentially alkylate the 5' flanking region of the high GC containing 
sequences of the c-Ha-ras oncogene in-vitro (Mattes et al., 1988).
Sequences of DNA rich in GC sequences are often associated with the
control of gene expression such as the SPI transcription factor binding 
sites of the c-Ha-ras gene. In addition to the number of oncogenes rich in
171
GC sequences, a number of viral sequences, in particular the Epstein Barr 
virus (EBV), have been identified as being unusually high in GC content. It 
has been suggested that the GC rich regions within the EBV genome may 
play an important role in control function (Karlin, 1986).
The studies outlined above have shown that even small changes in the 
structure of a bifunctional agent can significantly alter both the extent of 
DNA interstrand cross-link formation and the sequence at which the cross- 
linking reaction takes place. In a sense, it is remarkable that small 
molecules such as the nitrogen mustards and aziridinylbenzoquinones can 
distinguish between different sequences within DNA. On the other hand, 
the length of the DNA sequence cross-linked by these agents is 
disappointingly short, being 2 to 3 base pairs. It has been estimated that a 
unique sequence within the genome of a human cell consists of between 15 
and 19 base pairs (Dervan, 1986; Nielsen, 1991). However, it may not be 
necessary to achieve such a level of specificity and even a modest increase 
in the length of the recognition site could lead to substantial increase in 
biological effect (Hartley & Souhami, 1993). In addition, as the structure of 
the binding ligand becomes more complex, pharmacological problems may 
arise involving distribution and metabolism of the drug within the cell..
An understanding of the mechanism by which small molecules interact 
with and cross-link DNA can serve as a basis for the design and 
development of novel compounds which are capable of recognising an 
increased number of base pairs. Indeed, novel bifunctional compounds 
capable of recognising and cross-linking across 4 to 6 base pairs at specific 
DNA sequences have already been reported (Bose et al., 1992a; Bose et al.,
1992b; Ding & Hurley, 1991). As the knowledge of drug-DNA interstrand 
cross-linking re actions continues to expand, the prospect increases for a
172
new generation of compounds which are more effective in the treatment of 
neoplastic disease .
