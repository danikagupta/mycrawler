Abstract 
In fluidized bed rnactors, applled for nitrate removal in an aquaculture unit, 
denitrificatlon of nitrate was found to result in an accumulation of nitrite. 
Isolation of denltrifylng bacteria from these reactors revealed that most of these 
isolates produced nitrite from nitrate under controlled laboratory. conditions. Two of 
the isolates, one with accumulated nitrite while respiring on nitrate, and the other 
not, were subject to further studies. It was found that nitrite accumulation in one 
of these isolates could be adequately explained by differences in the relative rates 
of nitrate and nitrite reduction. Inhibiting concentrations of nitrite were lower for 
the isolate which did not accumulate nitrite. Incubation of the nitrite-accumulating 
isolate with different carbon sources resulted ln differences in the relative nitrite 
accumulation (as compared with the runount of nitrate reduced).

Introduction 
One of the charac teris ties of modern aquacul \:.ure is the trend to 
develop recirculated or semi-recirculated fish culture systems, in 
which fish can be grown at densities higher than so far known in 
more conventional fish culture sys terns , such as still water ponds. 
Although the investment and overhead costs of these intensive fish 
culture systems are usually high, certain local conditions might 
favor the use of such sys terns over the use of more conventional 
culture methods (Muir, 1981). 
The high fish densities at which these systems are operated and 
the corresponding large feed inputs would cause a rapid 
deterioration of the water quality were it not that methods 
assuring a proper water treatment a.re an intrinsic part of the 
overall system design. 
Water purification by means of so called biofilters is often 
employed in intensive fish culture sys terns. Most of the 
biofilters used are aimed at reducing the levels of ammonia in the 
culture system by facilitating gmwth of nitrifying bacteria which 
oxidize ammonia via nitrite to nitrate. Nitrate, the. end product 
of this process, is allowed to accumulate in the system as it is 
far less toxic to fish than the more reduced inorganic nitrogen 
fonns. However, a build-up of nitrate to high concentrations in 
the culture sys tern should be prevented for mainly two reasons . 
Firstly, high concentrations of nitrate might be toxic to some 
fish species while, secondly, limitations exist in many countries 
as to the maximal allowed levels of nitrate in the effluent 
waters. 
A pilot-scale biofiltration system aimed at reducing the levels of 
inorganic nitrogen from an intensive fish culture unit has been 
operative for two years at the experimental fish culture station 
near Ginosar (Israel). 1he biofiltration system consisted of an 
aerobic trickling filter and two anaerobic fluidized bed columns 
which facilitated the growth of nitrifying and denitrifying 
organisms, respectively. Under the operational conditions tested, 
nitrite accumulation was found to take place in both treatment 
steps (vnn nijn and fiivera, 1990). Denitrifying bacteria were 
isolated from the fluidized bed colwnns and two of these isolates, 
one of which accumulates nitrite during the process of Nitrite occumulotlon in denltrl flers 41 
denitr ification while the other does not, were subjected to 
further examination. Kinetics of nitrate and nitrite removal by 
these bacteria were examined at various ambient concentrations of 
these substrates. Furthermore, the effect of different carbon 
sources on the accumulation of nitrite was examined. 
Materials and Methods 
1. ENRICHMENT OF DENITIUFYING D/\CTEIU/\ 
To a crude sample from one of the fluidized bed columns, nitrate 
{KN03: 50 mg liter-1) was added and the sample was incubated at a 
temp erature of 27°c for 211 h under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic 
condi tions were established by nitrogen flushing of sealed culture 
vessels. After this incubation period a subsample was diluted 
(1:100} with minimal medium for isolation of denitrifying bacteria 
with yeast extract {0.11%) as a carbon source (Jeter and Ingraham, 
1981) and again incubated w1der anaerobic conditions. Til.is step 
was repeated until a sample was obtained with a low concent ration 
of organic matter and a high reduction of nitrate. 
2. ISOLATION 
A bacterial suspension from the enrichment cultures was streaked 
on solid agar with addition of minerals similar to that of the 
medium used for enrichment. Individual colonies from the solid 
medium were transferred to liquid medium, and were once more 
transferred to solid medium after growth in the liquid medium was 
observed. This step was related until axenic cultures were 
obtained. The axenic isolates obtained were tested for 
denitrifying properties by incubation in deep agar tubes. The 
formation of gas pockets in these tubes pointed to an isolate with 
denitrifying properties. 
3. TAXONOMIC TEST 
Identification of the bacterial isolates was performed by means of 
API-20NE. 42 J. van n1 j n and II. Slch 
4. NIIBATE J\ND NI1TIJ\TE 11EDUCTION 
Isolates were harvested in the stationary growth phase and 
distributed in the medium as described previously: a concentration 
of around 1 mg liter-1 protein. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations 
varied among the different runs (0-1200 mg liter-1 N0
3(2)-N). The 
changes in ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and protein, during anaerobic 
incubation in sealed culture vessels, were followed over a period 
in which a linear disappearance of either nitrate or nitrite took 
place (up to 24 h). Reduction rates of nitrate and nitrite were 
calculated by using linear regression analysis. The maximum 
standard error was 10%. nates were expressed as nitrate-N or 
nitrite-N reduction per h per mg protein, whereby the �nitial 
protein concentration of the sample was used for calculation. 
Protein concentrations during different runs did not change by 
more than 5%. During the period of linear reduction of nitrate and 
nitrite, ammonia depletion did not take place. 
Results and Discussion 
Changes in ammonia, nitrite and nitrate concentratio�s (influent -
effluent) were determined in pilot-scale fluidized bed reactors 
operated aL three different flow rates. It was found (Table I) 
that at the lowest flow rate examined (0.17 m-3 m-2 min-1) 
nitrate was removed by the fluidized bed, while ammonia and 
nitrite concentrations were higher in the effluent water. The same 
picture emet'ged at a flow _l'at: of 0:34 m-3 m-2 min-1 and at the 
highest flow rate (0.68 m 3 m 2 ruin 1) both nitrate and ammonia 
were removed by the colwnns while nitrite was shown to accumulate. 
Examination of even higher flow rates (not shown) resulted in 
large fluctuations in nitrate removal and even led to 
accumulation. It can be concluded that, although it was possible 
to orrate the fluidized bed colwnns at a flow rate (0.64 m-3 m-2 
ruin-) at which ammonia and nitrate removal from the treated rater 
occurred, nitrite removal did not occur and accumulation at all 
flow rates was examined. Nitrite accumulation by biological 
denitrification systems has been described by several authors 
(Wilderer et al., 1987; Nilson et al., 1980: Richard and Leprince, 
1982; Kurt et al., 1981\). It is considered to be a serious problem 
in the biological treatment of drinking water, as the admissible 
concentration of nitrite in some countries is as low as O .1 mg Nitrite accumulation in denltrifiers

N02 liter-1 (European Community, 1980). Also in fish culture 
systems too high nitrite concentr ations pose serious problems, as 
nitrite is toxic to fish at relatively low concentr ations (Colt 
and Tchobanoglous, 1976: Russo and 'Ihurston, 1977). 
Subsamples of the fluidized bed columns obtained on two different 
dates were incub ated in the laboratory under anaerobic conditions 
in the presence of nitrate, nitrite and anunoni a. After 24 h of 
incubation under these conditions it wus found (Table II} that the 
samples obtained on August 20, 1989 showed an almost complete 
nitrate removal over the 211 h period while 67% of the nitrate­
ni trogen which was removed was found to accumul ate as nitrite­
ni trogen. In the sample obtained from the fluidized bed reactor in 
October 1989 nitrate reduction was also apparent, while only 23% 
of the nitrate-nitrogen was accumulated as nitrite-nitrogen. 
'Ihe nitrite accumul ation observed during the 24 h incubation of 
the field samples can be attributed to the action of nitrate 
respirin g bacteria as the runs were conducted in the presence of 
ammonia {repressing the nitrate assimilatory pathway) and under I I i I 44 J. von IHJn ond II, Slch

strictly anaei--obic conditions (excluding the production of nitrite 
nitrific ation). Under these conditions various factors might 
underlie the observed accumulation of nitrite. Betlach and Tiedje 
(1981) found that nitrite accumulation in some strain of 
denitrifying organisms could be explained by the consistently 
lower activity of nitrite reduct ase than nitrate reductase. 
Differences in induction periods for the nitrate and nitrite 
reductase enzymes {Williams et al., 1978), differences in oxygen 
tolerance of the various reductases (Krul and Veeningen, 1977; 
Hochstein et al., 198l1), and the quantity and nature of electron 
donors (Knowles, 1982) are additional factors which have been 
shown to cause accumulation of nitrite in denitrifiers. Studies on 
fluidized bed reactors (van der Hoek and Klapwijk, 1987) revealed 
that by increasing the buffering capacity of the system, nitrite 
accumul ation could be prevented. It was postul ated that the high 
pH levels generated in the active denitrifying biofilms caused 
inhibiti on of nitrite reduct ase and, therefore, nitrite 
accumulation. Nitrite accumulation in denitrlflers �5 
Six strains of denitrifiers were isolated from samples obtained 
from the fluidized bed reactors. '111e results of a comparison of 
some taxonomic parameters using the API-20NE identification system 
is shown in Table III. Based on these characteristics, strain E 
could be identified as Pseudomonas acidovorans, strains D, E and F 
could be grouped in the genus Pseudomonas, with strains A and B 
being in the FLavobacterium genus. It was not possible to identify 
strain C to genus level by means of this test. 
Anaerobic incubation of these strains with a follow-up of the 
changes in ammonia, nitrite and nitrate revealed that five out of 
the six strains accumulated nitrite upon reduction of nitrate 
anaerobic conditions {Figure 1). Only in the case of strain A 
(FLavobacterium sp.) no nitrite was found to accumulate in the 
medium during nitrate reduction. 11)e finding, that after 10 h of 
incubation no further changes in nitrate and nitrite levels were 
observed, probably indicates that at this sampling time the carbon 
source had become exhausted. 
Tua of the isolates, D and A, were subjected to further studies, 
the first one showing the accumulation of nitrite during 
denitrification, while the other one denitrified nitrate without 
accumulating nitrite. 
'111e rate of nitrate reduction of strain D (Pseudomonas sp.) at 
various ambient concentrations of nitrate is depicted in Figure 
2A. Nitrate reduction rates followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and 
a maximum nitrate removal rate of lJ, 17 mg NO�-N/mg protein/h was 
reached at an ambient nitrate concentration of 300 mg liter-1• '111e 
nitrite reduction at the various nitrate concentrations (as 
calculated from the disappearance of nitrate and the accumulation 
of nitrite) followed the same trend as nitrate reductase activity 
(Figure 2B), but was considerably lower. '111e accumulation of 
nitrite at the various ambient nitrate concentrations (Figure 2C) 
increased with growing concentrations of nitrate. Finally, the 
nitrite reduction rates against various concentrations of ambient 
nitrite were examined (Figure 20). It was found that inhibition of 
nitrite reduction occurred at ambient nitrite concentrations 
between 45-55 mg liter-l N02-N. 
It becomes clear from these results that nitrite accumulation in 
the medium is due to the fact that nitrate reductase activity 1,6 J. van n!Jn and JI. Slch

drop in both nitrate and nitrite reduction at high ambient nitrate 
concentrations was probably due to the fact that at these 
concentrations, inhibition of nitrite occurred, since during these 
runs the concentrations of nitrite (Figure 2C) were in the range

The level at which nitrite causes inhibition in this strain was 
lower than for strain D. The higher sensitivity of strain A to 
nitrite might be explained by the fact that an accumulation of 
nitrate to high levels is prevented due to its relatively active 
nitrite reductase. This contrasts with bacterium D which exhibits 
a higher tolerance to nitrite, due probably to the fact that the 
organism itself-causes an increase in nitrite in its environment. 
It remains to be examined if the results obtained in these 
experiments are generally true for denitrifying bacteria that do 
and do not accumulate nitrite. If so, one might assume that in an 
environment where both types of bacteria are present (e.g. the 
fluidized bed columns), the concentration of nitrite might be an 
important factor controlling the dominance of one type over the 
other. 
Both bacteria were grown on a wide array of organic substrates 
under anaerobic conditions and the denitrifica tion rate was 
followed up over a period of 2L1 h (Figure ll). Both isolates were 
capable of growth on all organic carbon sources tested. As would 
be expected, the different carbon sources used (each with its 
specific energy yield) caused different rates of nitrate 
· reduction. Based on the results obtained in this experiment, it is 
impossible to discern whether the amount of nitrate reduced is 50 J. van Rljn ond II, Slch

these isolates over 24 h, as carbon depletion might have occurred 
during the incubation period. Nitrite accumulation in strain A was 
not apparent, while its accumulation (as a percent of nitrate 
reduced) in isolate D varied among the different carbon sources. 
'Ihe differences in nitrite accumulation of these cells when grown 
with different carbon sources might indicate the kinetic 
parameters of denitrification change according to· the carbon 
source supplied . TI1is finding is supported by earlier studies in 
which it was found that the availability of electron donor 
(Nommik, 1956; Wijler and Delwiche , 1954), as well as the type of 
electron donor (Bremmer, 1977), influence the composition of 
products from denitrificat ion. It can be concluded, therefore, 
that the choice of carbon source might to some extent prevent 
nitrite accumulation in the nitrite accumulating denitrifier 
examined in this study. It remains to be examined , however, if 
other carbon sources will cause a reduction of nitrate to nitrogen 
without the accumulation of nitrite. 
Conclus ions 
In this study a comparison of two denitrifying bacterial strains 
revealed that the nitrite accumulation observed in one of these 
strains was due to differences in activity of the nitrate and 
nitrite reductase enzymes. Nitrite was found to inhibit the 
activity of the strain that did not accumulate nitrite at lower 
concentrations, than did the strain that did accumulate nitrite. 
Furthennore, growth rates (not shown), and denitrification rates 
of the strain that did not accumulate nitrite, were found to be 
higher than those of the nitrite-accumulating strain. Based on the 
experimental evidence for those strains only, it could be possible 
to selectively enrich the non-nitrite-accumulating strain. In 
addition , it was found that diff erent carbon sources affected the 
rate of nitrite accumulation in the nitrite-accumula ting strain. 
To what extent these findings at this stage can be applied to 
improve the nitrite removal of fluidized bed reactors remains to 
be examined . It might be assumed, however, that a more thorough 
understanding of the microbial processes taking place in these 
fluidized bed reactors will eventually lead to such an 
improvemen t. 52 J. van n!Jn and II. Slch
