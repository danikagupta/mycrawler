 Abstract  Larval settlement stage of abalone ( Haliotis asinine)  depends on availability of feed and substrate compatibility. 
Existing feed size and feed type diversity in substrate will affect larval settlement stage, feeding habit and 
survival rate of abalone larvae. This study aims to find out the most suitable substrate for larval settlement of the tropical abalone. It is conducted in February-April, 2013  at Brackish Water Aquaculture Center, Takalar Regency, 
South Sulawesi. Applied experimental design is Completely Randomized Design. There are 3 types of test substrate: coral, cement and plastic with 3 replications for each substrate. This study shows that statistically, 
substrate differences do not affect to larval settlement st age. The highest stage of larval settlement is to coral 
substrate by 3.3%, followed by cement and plastic by 2.2%  and 0.2% respectively. The highest average stage of 
living larva on coral and cement substrate are 15.3%, while on plastic substrate is 8.7%.

1. Introduction Tropical abalone ( Haliotis 184sinine ) is one of aquatic biological resources  from coral reef with high economic 
value. Abalone belongs to export commodity with high pri ce either for its meat or eggshell. This shell is very 
popular in other countries such as Ja pan, US, European countries, Columbia  and Canada because of its delicious 
meat and low cholesterol level. Indeed, in Japan, New Zealand and Philipine, this shell has been cultivate 
(Kijima, et al., 2002 and Litaay et al., 2001). 
Abalone seeding effort has been developed, but its survival rate is still low of about 10-15% (William et al.,  
2008). Environmental factor (Baldwin et al., 2007 and Hadijah et al., 2013), feed type and size diversity (Chen and Chen, 2000) belong to determinant factors of abalone su rvival rate. At larval stage, substrate difference will 
affect growth rate (Bautista, 2003). Williams et al. , (2008) states that the success ra te of larvae in the process of 
settlement is determined by the substrate in the growth medium (Williams., et al,  2008).  
Larval settlement speed of abalone depends on availability of feed and substrate compatibility (Alle., et al,.  
2006). However, larval settlement of the tropical abalone ( H. 184sinine)  to different substrate has not been 
widely reported, especially those with seed parents from Tanakeke Islands, Takalar. 
Therefore did not already know the existence and potential of  local parent who can serve as a source of stem for 
seeding purposes of abalone in South Sulawesi. 
2. Research Method 2.1 Research Schedule and Site This study is conducted in February-April, 2013 at abalone hatchery of Brackish Water Aquaculture Center, 
Takalar Regency, South Sulawesi. 
2.2 Research Material 
Used container in this study is 12 plastic containers with the size of 50x40x30 cm and they are pr ovided with 
aeration equipments. Used test animal is 1200 Haliotis asinins  larvae at the age of 0 day and 0.1-0.5 mm length. www.ccsenet.org/mas Modern Applie d Science V ol. 9, No. 1; 2015

 In order to grow up natural feed Nitzchia  sp., Na 2SiO 3, KNO 3 and Na 2HPO 4 are used. 
2.3 Research Procedure 
Larvae are spread in cultivation container with density of  100 larvae/container by mean s of flowing water system 
and aeration. Larval feed Nitzchia  sp are spread in two weeks before larv al spreading. Here is how the fertilizer 
is prepared: Solution I, 200 ml of Silicate (Na 2SiO3), is dissolved in 5 liter of distilled water and then stirred to 
make it completely dissolved. Solution II, KNO 3 = 800 gram, Na 2HPO 4= 250 gram and Clewat32 = 80 gram, are 
dissolved in 10 liter of distilled water and stirred to make them completely dissolved. Next, material as larval settlement place is arranged into treatment container. Ha tched larvae (veliger) are taken care for 1 month until 
they are 1 cm length. When day 11 comes, circulation is given to larval cultivation medium. During this 
cultivation, larvae are only fed by natural feed Nitzschia sp.  
2.4 Design of Experiment and Data Analysis This study is designed based on completely randomized de sign with 3 treatments and 3 replications. Observed 
treatments uses different substrate, they are: (A) coral, (B ) cement and (C) plastic. Collected data in this study is 
larval settlement stage to the substrate and survival of ab alone larva. Larval settlement to substrate is counted by 
applying NRC formulation (1977) as follow:

Description: 
SR: Settlement Rate (%) 
Nt: Amount of settlement abalone larva in the final of study (number of larva) 
No.: Amount of settlement abalone larva in  the initial of study (number of larva) 
In this study, all of the research finding are presented in  average value. Data is analyzed by applying Variant 
Analysis (ANOVA) through SPSS Program version 16.0 to determine the existence of differences at 
inter-treatment. Statistically, it is considered as significant if P<0.05 (S teel and Torrie, 1982). 
3. Research Findings and Discussion  
3.1 Abalone Larval Settlement 
Research finding by using substrate as larval  settlement medium of the tropical abalone ( Haliotis asinine ) by the 
age of 0 day up to the settlement st age shows settlement difference although  it uses similar feed dose for each 
treatment (3000 ml). Result of variant analysis shows that th ere is no effect of larval settlement to the substrates 
(P>0.05). Based on this finding, average value of  larval settlement of the tropical abalone ( Haliotis sinine) can 
be seen in the following figure.

 highest rate in treatment A, i.e., coral substrate by averag e value of settlement rate 3.3%. Then, it is followed by 
treatment B cement and treatment C wave plastic by aver age value of 2.2 and 0.2 respectively. Based on the 
finding, it is seen that every treatment has different amount  of settlement whether to coral, cement or iron plastic 
substrate. 
Result of variant analysis shows that there is no obvious effect of larval settlement to the substrates (P>0.05). 
Follow up tuckey test in each treatment  shows that larval settlement degrad ation rate to the substrate in all 
treatments do not obviously give an effect (P>0.05).  
The greatest amount of abalone larval settle ment is in treatment A on day 2, day 3 and day 4, which is attached to 
coral substrate with 5 tails of each coral. Then, it is followed by treatment B on day 2 with 3 tails to each 
substrate, while treatment C reaches its greatest amount on day 2 with 2 larvae. Lack of larv al settlement to the 
substrate is caused by lack of handling way toward those larv ae. It is also caused by low survival rate of the larva 
in each treatment. 
This finding is also supported by statement of William, 2008 stating that abalone seeding effort has been 
developed, but its survival rate is still low of about 10-15% (Williams., et al , 2008). Environmental factor 
(Hadijah, et al., 2013), feed type and feed size (Gullardo and Buen, 2003: Setyono, 2007) are determinant factors 
for abalone seeding success rate.  
At larval stage, substrate difference will affect abalone growth stage (William et al., 2008). Speed rate of larval 
settlement of abalone depends on availability of feed and substrate compatibility (William et al., 2008). Existing 
feed type and feed size diversity on su bstrate will affect larval settlement, feeding habit and survival rate of 
abalone larva (Allen.,  et al , 2006). 
Therefore, it can be concluded that survival rate of larv a produced from seeding effort is quite low as stated by 
Allen et al., (2006). He states that survival rate of abalone larva is too low of about 0.6-1.00 % (Allen., et al, 
2006). Allegedly, when abalone larva is at trochophore and veliger stage, mass death is occurred which causes 
low level of abalone survival rate. It might also cause by availability of natural feed in its early growth medium, 
environmental condition, cultivation medium, feed size and feed type and also lack of control to larval growth in 
cultivation container. 
3.2 Survival Rate  
Finding on effect of different substrate to larval settlement of the tropical abalone (Haliotis asinine)  shows 
different amount of living larva at each treatment. Calcul ation of abalone larva at each treatment to different 
substrate toward larval survival rate does not show any ob vious effect (P>0.05). Averag e survival rate of abalone 
larva living in each treatment can be seen  in appendix 1, while average survival rate of the larva can be seen in 
the following Figure 2: 
 
 
Figure 2. Amount of living abalone larva in each treatment 
 
The greatest average amount of living abalone in each treat ment to the coral, cement and iron plastic is in 
treatment A and C by average amount of 15.3, and it is followed by treatment B to wave plastic substrate by 
living average amount of 8.7.

 High amount of abalone larva ( Haliotis asinine)  living in treatment A on coral substrate is caused by availability 
of sufficient feed either for its size, amount and its natural habitat by attaching to the coral as supported by Setyono (2005). The existing feed type and feed size dive rsity will affect larval settlement, feeding habit and 
survival rate of abalone larva (Setyono, 2005). 
The finding (Kawamura et al,  2002), shows sediment effect to larv al settlement of the tropical abalone ( Haliotis 
diversicolor). Most of abalone larva lives on rocky substrate and coral. Speed rate of larval settlement of abalone 
depends on availability of feed and substrate compatibility (William et al., 2008; Maliao., 2004). Existing feed 
type and size diversity on substrate will affect larval settle ment, feeding habit and survival rate of abalone larva 
(Setyono, 2005). 
Most of abalone diseases come from water which is used in the seeding process. Based on analysis conducted by 
Brackish Water Aquaculture Center Takalar, one causal dis eases of abalone come from vibrio, a bacteria type. On 
the other hand, William, et al., (2008) states that appropriate substrate for tropical abalone larva is corallinales 
type from Amphiora sp  species (William et al. , 2008). 
3.3 Water Quality Measurement on water quality during the study shows that the existing water quality parameter in Brackish 
Water Aquaculture Center is proper to be used. Range value on water quality parameter during the study can be 
seen in table 4 as follows: 
 Table 1. Water Quality Parameter of Abalone Larva ( H. sinine ) 
No. Parameter Unit of Measurement Average Value 
1. Salinity ppt 30 
2. Temperature °C 28-29 
3. DO mg/l 3–7 4. pH - 7 5. Ammonia ppm <> 6. Brightness M >10 
 
4. Conclusion and Suggestion 4.1 Research Conclusion  
Based on research finding on  tropical abalone larva ( H. asinina ), it can be concluded that:  
1. Success rate of abalone seeding effort, especially the settlement is determined by seed parents quality, 
feeding management, water quality management and pest and disease control. 
2. Water quality parameter for abalone shells s eeding is of pH 7-8, temperature at 28-29 
oC, water salinity at 
30 ppt and DO at 3-7 ppm. 
3. Average rate of larval settlement to substrate does not show any obvious effect  at each treatment.  
4.2 Research Suggestion In order to ensure seeding success rate in abalone cultiv ation, cultivation medium should be highly cared for.
