203INTRODUCTION
Food wastes (FW) are the main component 
of municipal solid waste (MSW). The estimates 
provided by Food and Agricultural Organization 
(2011), Carlson et al. (2012) and Zaman (2013) 
indicate increasing global food consumption 
and an over 40% increase in FW production by 
2025. While analyzing the issues of the MSW 
economy, attention should be paid to the increase 
in the recycling of biodegradable waste. This 
process is related to the progressive reduction 
of storing in landfills waste that can be re-used 
(Wiliams, 2005).
One of the most popular FW recycling meth -
ods is composting. It belongs to the key tech -
nologies commonly used worldwide (Pitchel, 
2010). Under temperate climate conditions, the 
composting process is divided into two stages, 
which in total should last for at least 8 weeks. The 
long duration time of the process depends on the 
choice of the composting method (active system with oxidation of the material or passive without 
oxidation) and the processed material type. On 
the basis of the research conducted in various 
countries, it was found that the first phase of the 
composting process should last approximately 2 
weeks. Then, the material is directed to stabili -
zation, which lasts 6–8 weeks. Currently, many 
studies in the field of optimization of the kinetics 
of the composting process in its first phase and 
the elimination of accompanying odorous sub -
stances are conducted globally (Lebrero et al., 
2011; Yuan et al., 2015; Fernández et al., 2016; 
Jinyi et al., 2016; Siles et al., 2016; Yongjiang et 
al., 2016). In addition, in the literature on the sub -
ject there are studies on the additional hygieniza -
tion of the stabilized material and the possibility 
of using gases generated during the process. One 
of the main problems associated with composting 
is the generation of the leachate containing ma -
terial that has been extracted, suspended or dis -
solved in waste (Benlboukht et al., 2016; Junya et 
al., 2016; Lian et al., 2016; Mukesh et al., 2016). Journal of Ecological EngineeringReceived: 2019.02.20

ABSTRACT
The research was conducted to investigate the efficiency and possibilities of advanced oxidation process based on 
ozone-hydrogen peroxide. The process was used as a post-treatment step of composting leachate utilisation. The 
leachate samples were collected from a typical composting plant with the aerobic biological treatment system. The 
samples were conditioned in a “ozone reactor” without dilution. The effectiveness of the treatment process was 
measured by pH values (4.0 –7.0), H2O2 concentrations (0.5 –4.0 g∙dm-3), ozone doses (0.5 –1.5 g∙h-1) and reaction 
times (0 –10 min). The highest removal efficiencies achieved were 85% and 92% for chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), respectively. The optimum process parameters occurred at pH 
5.0, 2.0 g∙dm-3 concentration of H2O2, and 0.75 g∙h-1 of ozone dose. The optimal reaction time was 3 min. The O3/
H2O2 advanced oxidation process was found to oxidize COD and BOD5 of the composting leachate. The oxidation 
reaction can be used as a feasible technique for composting leachate treatment.

advanced oxidation processes (AOP)are very 
popular in current technologies of neutraliza -
tion of fluid process residues. Most commonly, 
they are used to eliminate color, reduce the load 
of organic pollutants or reduce the toxicity of 
water and wastewater (Jia et al., 2011; Cortez 
et al., 2011). The principle of AOP is based on 
the release of hydroxyl radicals, which acceler -
ate the degradation of organic compounds in the 
aquatic environment.
The most popular AOP is the O3/H2O2 system, 
which is used as a chemical process for purifica -
tion and pre-treatment of wastewater (Maniero et 
al. 2008; Rosal et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009; Qui -
ang et al.; 2010). Tizaoui et al. (2007) obtained 
during the ozonization of the leachate the COD 
removal rate of 27% and the color reduction by 
85%. Rivas et al. (2003) and Hagman et al. (2008) 
received at least a 20% reduction in COD using 
only hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Using ozone 
along with the H2O2, a COD reduction of 20–50% 
can be achieved (Tizaoui et al., 2007; Hagman et 
al., 2008; Goi et al., 2009). The presented results 
refer to the application of the AOP system for 
wastewater. The leachates from the composting 
process are a more specific waste, the properties 
of which depend mainly on the oxygenation and 
moisture of the processed material. 
The purpose of this article is to present the 
possibility of using the O3/H2O2 oxidation system 
in the process of preliminary preparation of the 
leachate from the FW composting process for 
neutralization in a professional wastewater treat -
ment plant. The effectiveness of the process was 
assessed by the BOD5, COD dynamics of change 
and BOD5/COD ratio.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Leachate samples
The leachate samples were prepared during 
the FW composting process in the BKB 100 iso -
thermal bioreactor for the study of organic ma -
terial decomposition processes. A FW mixture 
consisting of vegetables (50%), fruit (25%), ex -
pired food (15%) and sawdust (10%) with a total 
fresh weight of 50 kg was used for the tests. The 
composition of the mixture was selected to ob -
tain appropriate structural properties of compost, 
while ensuring proper air flow in the bioreactor, 
biomass moisture during the process (54–68%) 
and a C:N ratio above 20. In order to achieve a proper composting process and a distinct thermo -
philic phase, the air flow in the bioreactor was set 
at 0.035 m3∙h-1∙kgdw-1 (which was 0.4 m3∙h-1 in the 
composted waste mass). During the process, a to -
tal of 3.3 dm3 leachates were created.
Experimental procedure
The advanced leachate oxidation process was 
carried out in a flow glass reactor. The reactor 
is equipped with a stirrer, by means of which it 
is possible to aerate the mixture with the ozone 
coming from the discharge generator. Through 
the system of independent infusions, the leachates 
and the hydrogen peroxide solution are infused 
into the reaction chamber. The AOP procedure 
proceeded according to the following scheme:
1. Filling the reactor with 1 dm3 of the leachate, 
which was mixed applying air with a capacity 
of 5.0 dm3·min-1 over a period of 5 minutes.
2. The AOP process involved:
a) Addition of H2O2 (1 g·dm-3) and ozone (1 g·h-1), 
reaction time 10 minutes, regulation of the re -
action using 1N sodium hydroxide in the range 
of 4÷7 (optimization of the reaction).
b) Differentiated H2O2 concentration at the op -
timal pH in the range of 0.5÷4 g·dm-3, ozone 
dose 1 g·h-1, reaction time – 10 minutes.
c) Modification of ozone concentration in the 
range of 0.5÷1.5 g·h-1, reaction time 10 min -
utes, optimal pH and H2O2 concentration. 
3. For each step presented in section 2, pH, COD, 
BOD5, BOD5/COD analyses were performed.
Materials and analysis
Hydrogen peroxide (30%, w/w) and sodium 
hydroxide solution (1 N) were of analytical re -
agent grade (Merck, Germany). Ozone was pro -
duced in the O3PRO30,7VW generator, equipped 
with a corona electrode system. The pH was 
measured by an Elmetron CP-511 conductometer 
with an EPS-1 glass electrode for the measure -
ment of pH in the aqueous solution. COD was 
measured using a standard miniaturized method 
in airtight tubes, in accordance with the PN-ISO 
15705:2005 standard. For the BOD5 measure -
ment, the respirometric method described in DIN 
EN 1899 H55 was used, which uses OxiTop Con -
trol IS (WTW, Germany) for measurements. All 
experiments were carried out in 5 repetitions. 
During testing, the temperature was maintained 
at 22±1°C and humidity at 55±5%.205
Journal of Ecological Engineering   Vol. 20(5), 2019RESULTS 
The examined leachate samples were taken 
from the process of composting biodegradable 
waste in container technology. The basic leach -
ate parameters were 36.9 g·dm-3 (COD), 19.7 
g·dm-3 (BOD5) at pH 7.32 and electrical conduc -
tivity 12.73 mS·cm-1. The sample of the leachate 
was characterized by a black color and a sharp, 
irritating odor. The analyzed leachate samples 
have distinctively high level of oxygen demand, 
whereas the BOD5/COD ratio was 0.53, which 
indicates a high potential of biodegradability of 
organic matter.
The values of COD and BOD5 at the pH of 
5.0 reached maximum, which amounted to 26% 
and 31%, respectively (Fig. 1). The efficiency of 
oxygen demand reduction fell above the pH value 
of 9.5 and remained stable. The Pearson correla -
tion test showed a direct linear relationship be -
tween the pH values and COD removal efficiency 
(P <0.05, r = 0.817) and BOD5 (P <0.05, r = 0.836).
The effect of various concentrations of H2O2 
was examined in eight variants of concentration 
0.5÷4 g·dm-3 with the ozonization efficiency of 1 
g·h-1 (Fig. 2). The maximum degradation of COD 
and BOD5 was 42% and 49%, respectively, at a 
concentration of 3.0 g·dm-3 H2O2. A further in -
crease in the H2O2 concentration caused slower 
degradation of both COD and BOD5. The Pearson 
correlation test showed a direct linear relationship 
between the H2O2 concentration and BOD5 re-
moval efficiency (P <0.05, r = 0.728). At the same 
time, this test showed an inverse relationship 
between H2O2 concentration and COD removal, 
which was not significant (P <0.05, r = -0.408).
The effect of the ozone dose on the removal of 
COD and BOD5 in the presence of an optimized dose of H2O2 and pH (5.0) caused a linear increase 
in the degradation of oxygen demand and con -
stant reaction time (Fig. 3). The highest efficiency 
of COD removal (36%) was achieved with 0.75 
g·dm-3 ozone dose. Removal of BOD5 achieved 
the highest reduction at an analogous dose of 
ozone and amounted to 49%. The above-men -
tioned results were achieved during a 10-minute 
reaction time.
In order to examine the effect of reaction time 
on the oxygen demand reduction efficiency, an 
experiment was carried out at variable reaction 
times of 0÷10 minutes in the previously opti -
mized doses of H2O2 and O3 (Fig. 4). The results 
showed that the increase in the reaction time lin -
early increases the efficiency of oxygen demand 
reduction. The maximum COD and BOD5 reduc -
tion values were 63% and 69%, respectively, at 
4 minutes. In the reaction time range of 6÷10 
minutes, the oxygen demand reduction efficien -
cies did not change significantly. The results of 
Pearson correlation test showed a direct linear 
relationship between the reaction time and the re -
duction efficiency of BOD5 (P <0.05, r = 0.992) 
and COD (P <0.05, r = 0.998).
The BOD5/COD ratio during the ozonization 
changes in time analogous to the variability of the 
reduced indicators. For the untreated samples, it 
reached 0.53. After taking into account the op -
timal process conditions, the BOD5/COD ratio 
amounted to 0.38.
DISCUSSION
In the carried out study, stable results were 
obtained at lower pH values than described 
in 20–21. Figure 1 shows that a more stable

Fig. 3 . Effect of the O3 on COD and BOD5 removal (pH [5.0], H2O2 [3.0 g·dm-3] and reaction time [10 min]) reduction in oxygen demand was achieved by 
leachate than in Cortez et al. (2011). The studies 
showed that the effect of using H2O2 positively 
influenced the efficiency of removing pollutants 
while using concentrations in the range of 1.5–2.5 
g·dm-3. Cortez et al. (2011) noted the positive ef -
fect of using the O3/H2O2 system in relation to the 
ozonation alone. In his studies, he achieved a re -
duction of COD from 27% to 72% depending on 
hydrogen peroxide concentration.
Studies by Tizaoui et al. (2007) and Rivas 
et al. (2003) stated that the application of exces -
sive doses of H2O2 adversely affects the process 
of wastewater treatment. This has also been con -
firmed in the carried out studies as illustrated in 
Figure 2. Tizaouni et al. (2007) received optimal 
process parameters at the hydrogen peroxide con -
centration 2 g·dm-3. With further increase in con -
centration (up to 6 g·dm-3) the process efficiency 
decreased by 6.5%.
Ozone may participate in the generation of 
hydroxyl radicals. While increasing the concen -
tration of O3 in the studied process, the COD and 
BOD5 removal rate improved (Fig. 3). Hydroxyl 
radicals that have not participated in wastewater 
treatment, together with ozone, increase the de -
gradability of pollutants, confirming studies 24. In 
the study by Maniero et al. (2008) a 70% decrease in the COD value was obtained after the applica -
tion of ozone at a dose of 9 g·dm-3. In analogous 
studies by Cortez et al. (2011) COD removal at 
25% was achieved with the concentration of O3 in 
the range of 63–112 g·dm-3.
Reaction time is a key indicator of the waste -
water treatment process. The conducted research 
has shown that the use of AOP effectively re -
duces the time needed to remove contaminants. 
At the same time, the positive, the synergistic ef -
fect of using oxidants on wastewater treatment, 
described by 8–20, was confirmed. The achieved 
results of reducing the reaction time (Fig. 4), gave 
better results than those described in papers Lian 
et al. (2016) and Mukesh et al. (2016).
The presented research results show that the 
proper use of the O3/H2O2 oxidation system in -
creases the biodegradability of wastewater. Simi -
lar results were obtained by Goi et al. (2009) 
during the leachate treatment using the Fenton re -
action. In addition, during the process of contam -
inants oxidation, changes in the molecular struc -
ture of contaminants were achieved, as shown by 
the BOD5/COD indicator. By reducing the oxygen 
demand, a transformation of compounds that are 
difficult to biodegrade into more degradable forms 
has been achieved, which was also described 
by Jinyi et al. (2016) and Rivas at al. (2003).

Journal of Ecological Engineering   Vol. 20(5), 2019CONCLUSION
The results of the carried out tests clearly 
show that the combination of H2O2 and O3 in one 
oxidation system is an effective way to reduce the 
oxygen demand during leachate treatment. The 
optimum process conditions occur at the pH of 
5.0 and the addition of oxidants at the level of 
0.75 g·dm-3 each. The optimal and reasonable re -
action time is 4 minutes. The test results indicate 
the beneficial effect of AOP on process leach -
ates, reducing the BOD5/COD ratio by 30%, thus 
– lowering the oxygen demand during the treat -
ment. The use of this reaction, due to the high 
biodegradability of leachates from the compost -
ing process, can be a preparatory process before 
transferring them to a wastewater treatment plant.
