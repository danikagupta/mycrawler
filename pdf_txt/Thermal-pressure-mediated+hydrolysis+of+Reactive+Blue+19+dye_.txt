The thermal-pressure-mediated hydrolysis rates and the degradation kinetics of environmentally persis-
tent Reactive Blue (RB) 19 dye were studied. The dye decomposition was studied at 40–120◦C, pH 2–10,
and atmospheric pressure range of 1–2 atm. The intermediates and end products formed during thedegradation were identiﬁed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a possible degradationpathway of RB 19 was proposed. The stability of the dye in aqueous solution was inﬂuenced by changesin pH. At pH 4, half-life was 2247.5 min at 40
◦C and it reduced to 339.4 min when the temperature was
increased to 120◦C. Acidic conditions were more conducive to enhance hydrolysis rate than basic ones
as the decomposition was optimum at pH 4. The kinetic studies indicated that the rate of hydrolysisapparently followed ﬁrst order reaction. A linear relationship was observed between hydrolysis rateof RB 19 dye and increasing temperatures and pressures. Overall, 23% dye decomposition occurred in120 minutes at pH 4, 120
◦C and pressure of 2 atm. Along with thermal-pressure, a combination of tech-
niques like physico-chemical, biological, enzymatic etc. may be more suitable choice for the effectivetreatment of RB19 dye.

1. Introduction
Dyes are used in a number of industries such as textile, leather,
food, pharmaceutical, plastics, cosmetics and paper printing [1,2] .
There exist various classes of dyes, like azo, anthraquinone, reac-tive, acidic, basic, neutral, disperse and direct dyes. But the mostcommonly used dyes are azo and anthraquinone dyes [3–5] . They
constitute more than 60% of reactive dyes. Wastewater dischargedfrom Textile industries contains high concentrations of reactivedyes and other contaminants that pose serious threats to sus-tainability of natural ecosystems [6]. Further, dyes disturb aquatic
ecosystems by obstructing light penetration and oxygen transferinto water bodies [7]. Moreover, the contamination of reactive dyes
may present a risk to the aquatic living organisms through bioac-cumulation thus entering into food chain [8,9] . Toxicity of reactive
dyes has been reported at concentrations as low as 5.2 mg L
−1[10].
Recently, different methods dealing with treatment of textile
wastewater like conventional methods including physico-chemicaltreatment [6], biological oxidation [11], adsorption and advanced
oxidation processes (AOPs), e.g. ozonation, photolysis, electro-chemical, sonolysis [12,13] etc., have been investigated. Usually,
these processes lead to the release of more toxic products than

Hydrolysis is one of the principal detoxiﬁcation mechanisms fororganic compounds. At high temperature and pressure, pure liquidwater becomes surprisingly effective medium for the degradationof organic compounds. By increasing pressure the rate of chemicalreaction increases due to increase in dissociation constant of water.Rapid conversions are observed for the majority of organic com-pounds [15]. Also hydrolysis by-products are normally less toxic to
the environment than parent compound [16].
Water at high temperature and pressure simultaneously acts
as a solvent, catalyst and reagent for reactions that are typicallycatalyzed by acids or bases. By using this process very selectivetransformations are accessible by reactions in pure, hot water with-out using toxic and environmentally destructive materials [15].
The objective of the present study was to investigate the rate
of hydrolysis at different pH, pressure and temperature conditionsand its kinetics to comprehend the degradation of RB 19 dye. Theintermediates and end products were identiﬁed and a possibledegradation pathway was proposed.

Textile Mills, Faisalabad, Pakistan which was used without further
puriﬁcation. The stock solution of RB19 was prepared at lab scaleby dissolving 1000 mg in a liter of distilled water. For the hydrolysisstudies the stock solution was further diluted as per requirementsof the experiment.
2.2. Experimental procedure
Synthetic dye solution was distributed into different ﬂasks (1 L
capacity) and then pH was adjusted as per requirements of theexperiment with the help of pH meter (HANNA of model HI 99003).The initial pH of the sample was set by using dilute sodium hydrox-ide (1 M) or hydrochloric acid (1 M). The initial dye concentrationin each sample was 100 mg L
−1after dilution contained in 200 mL
of the sample. The hydrolysis experiments were conducted in auto-clave under different conditions of temperatures (40, 60, 80, 100,120
◦C) and pressures (1 and at 2 atm pressure). Various pH condi-
tions used were 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Each experiment was conductedfor 2 h and samples were drawn at time intervals of 30, 60, 90 and120 minutes to measure the dye decomposition. Each experimentwas performed in duplicates.
2.3. Analytical procedures
The color and concentration of dye in the treated efﬂuents were
determined by using UV Spectrophotometer (IRMECO of ModelU2020) at scanning spectrum of 200–800 nm [17]. In order to deter-
mine the percentage decolorization, following formula was used.

where, Ctand Coare the concentrations (mg L−1) of dye at reac-
tion time tand 0, respectively [17]. Residual dye concentrations
were determined by using the value of absorbance at the char-acteristic wavelength ( /NAK
max= 256) from the spectrum. Changes in
concentration in the solution were calculated by Beer–Lambert law.

where Ais the absorbance, l, the path length (cm), ε, the molar
extinction coefﬁcient (mol−1cm−1) and C, the dye concentration at

The total organic carbon (TOC) of the samples was determined
using TOC analyzer (Shimadzu, model TOC-V CSH). The instrumentwas operated at 680
◦C furnace temperature and 20 mL sample
injection. Reduction in percentage total organic carbon content wasmeasured using following equation [19,20] .

The degradation products were identiﬁed using gas chromatog-
raphy/mass spectrometry (GC–MS) (PerkinElmer Clarus 600). Thesamples were collected at different time intervals and wereextracted according to the procedure reported in the literature [21].
The GC was equipped with an Elite-xlb column (30 m ×0.25 mm)
and 0.25 /H9262m ﬁlm thickness and connected directly to MS. The
GC column was operated at 40
◦C for 1.50 min which was than
increased to 300◦C at the rate of 20◦C/min. The other experimental
conditions were: helium as a carrier gas with the ﬂow rate of 1 mL,sample volume 1 /H9262L, injection temperature 200
◦C, injection mode
split, and split ratio is 50.
2.4. Statistical analysis and graphical work
All determinations were performed in duplicate and mean val-
ues are presented in the results. Statistical comparisons of the meanvalues were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followedby Duncan’s multiple range test ( p< 0.05), using SAS 8.3 software
(SAS Ins. Inc., Cary, USA). Graphical work was carried out usingcomputer program Sigma Plot

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Effect of pH
The decomposition rate of the dye under investigation was
highly inﬂuenced by the reaction pH as shown in Fig. 1 . A signif-
icant increase ( p< 0.05) in the percentage decomposition of dye
was observed with the decreasing pH and the highest value wasobtained in acidic conditions. It seemed that the hydrolytic reactionmight have been catalyzed by hydronium ions in acidic medium.Since hydrogen ions (H
+) are not consumed during hydrolysis and
just act as a catalyst, so they acts as a better catalyst as comparedto OH
−for the conversion of RB 19 dye in to inorganic compounds
[22].
Moreover, the H+ions not only act as catalysts but also enhance
the electro negativity of the leaving group in acidic conditions,which helps in breaking of the bonds in the RB 19 dye. Thus, therate of hydrolysis continues to increase with increasing H
+ion
concentrations [15]. The present experiment had an interesting
observation that hydrolytic rate did not increase further when pHwas lowered below 4. Insigniﬁcant difference for dye degradationwas observed for pH 2 and 4, but we considered pH 4 as optimumexperiment due to convenience. Our results are in agreement withRajkumar et al. [21].
3.2. Effect of temperature and pressure
As the temperature and pressure were increased from 40 to
120
◦C and atmospheric pressure to high pressure, the rates of
decomposition were also signiﬁcantly ( p< 0.05) increased Fig. 2 .
Water provides more suitable and favorable reaction medium athigh temperature than boiling water at atmospheric pressure fororganics. With the increase in temperature from 40 to 120
◦C, the
ionic product (dissociation constant) of water increases and thedielectric constant of water falls rapidly. These changes in the phys-ical properties alter the solvent properties of water [15].
At high temperature and pressure, water acts simultaneously
as a convenient solvent, catalyst and reagent for reactions that aretypically catalyzed by the acid or base. High temperature and pres-sure makes the water as the most effective medium for reactionsof the organic compounds. Moreover, the chances of pollution are
