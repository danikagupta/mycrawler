Abstract 
DT-diaphorase (DTD) is an enzyme that acts on its substrates in a single-step two 
electron transfer reaction. It has a dual role both as a prodrug-activating enzyme and as a 
protector against carcinogenesis mediated by xenobiotics. A fiequently occurrïng base 
change, a C to T transition in exon six of the DTD gene, has been associated with low to 
undetectable DTD activity. Also, tumor cells Vary in their DTD levels, which poses a 
limitation for the use of drugs that rely on DTD for their chemotherapeutic effects. 
To test directly the effect of the base change on enzyme activity, mammalian cells 
were 
transfected with expression vectors containing DTD cDNA with a C or T nucleotide 
at position 609. Results indicated that this base change is a mutation in the DTD gene 
which results in impaired activity and reduced protein stability. 
The 
relationship 
between the status of the DTD nucleotide 609 allele and 
enzyrnatic 
activity was assessed in a panel of human fibroblast ce11 strains. DTD activity 
was, on average, Zfold higher in cells that were homozygous for the wild-type allele 
compared to heterozygotes. 
Cells 
that were homozygous for the variant 
allele 
displayed 
low to undetectable DTD activity and trace Ievels of DTD protein. A unique ce11 strain 
that is 
heterozygous 
yet has low to undetectable DTD activity and protein was shown to 
express DTD mRNA exclusiveIy fiom the variant allele. These results demonstrate that the statu of the nucleotide 609 ailele can, to a first approximation, predict for DTD 
activity and function. 
The possibility of using DTD in gene therapy was investigated by developing 
adenoviral vectors that detiver DTD to sensitize cells that are deficient in this enzyme. 
Infection of mitomycin C-resistant cells with an adenoviral vector that canies a minigene 
for wild-type DTD rendered them sensitive to this dmg. The degree of sensitization 
depended on multiplicity of infection.. 
These 
studies demonstrate the role of the C to T mutation in affecting DTD 
activity and function and provide "proof of principle" data for the use of DTD as an 
enzyme for vims-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy. Dedicared ro the memory of my Mother, Shanti Misra. You are a part of me. Acknowledgements

Introduction 1.1 Overview of Introduction 
DT-diaphorase (DTD) rnay play an important role in cancer chemotherapy as well 
as in cancer prevention. As a background to the new data presented in Chapters 2-4 of 
this 
thesis, 
four 
areas 
are reviewed: 1 ) the dual nature of DTD; 2) DTD poIymorphisms; 
3) a role for DTD in gene therapy; and 4) an overview of work presented in the data 
chapters. 
The first part of this chapter focuses on the dual nature of DTD as 1) a prodrug 
activating enzyme; and 2) as a xenobiotic detoxifier; both roles arising fiom its 
biochemical 
function as a single-step two electron reductase (Ross et al., 1993). Although 
this enzyme 
acts 
on a wide variety of substrates, most attention has been given to 
naturally 
occurring 
and synthetic 
quinone-based 
compounds. 
Quinones 
such as 
mitomycin C (MMC) cm serve as prodnigs that are activated through DTD-rnediated 
reduction to 
DNA-alkylating 
anti-cancer 
agents. Exploiting the role of DTD as a 
chemotherapeutic 
drug-activating 
enzyme has become an important area of investigation 
in the field of bioreductive prodrug therapy. In addition, naturally occurring quinones in 
the environrnent, such as those found in industrial pollutants, can be rendered non-toxic 
when 
rnetabolized 
by DTD. In this regard, DTD can also be viewed as a xenobiotic 
detoxification enzyme that 
functions as a defense mechanism against carcinogenesis. 
Cloning 
of the human DTD gene has led to the identification of upstream transcriptional 
regulatory elements involved in substrate 
(xenobiotic)-mediated 
upregulation of this 
enzyme. 
The second part of this chapter describes a commonlysccurring base change at 
nucleotide 609 of DTD cDNA (located in exon 6 of the human DTD gene) that is predicted to resdt in a proline to serine change at amino acid 187 and has ken associated 
with 
reduced 
catalytic 
activity (Traver et al., 1992) and decreased protein stability. A 
number of reports have linked this mutation to a range of diseases, including some 
cancers, supporting the notion that DTD has a protective role against carcinogenesis, and 
providing some insight into the physiological Function of DTD. These studies have 
revealed that this mutation occurs in many diseased and normai reference populations. 
The high fiequency of this mutation is important when considering the role of DTD as a 
xenobiotic detoxifier and as a cancer chemotherapeutic dmg activator. 
The third part of this introductory chapter focuses on a possible role for 
reductively activated 
dmgs and their activation enzymes in gene therapy. The cornmon 
occurrence of the 
nul1 
nucleotide 609 allele rnay contribute to the heterogeneity in DTD 
enzyme activities between individuals. Lack of suficient activating enzyme levels has 
been an obstacle to the ïmplementation of enzyme-prodnig therapy. The use of DTD in a 
gene therapy approach using a first generation Ad5 delivery vector is descnbed. Delivery 
and overexpression of an exogenous DTD minigene may provide a non-invasive means to 
ensure adequate levels of this enzyme prior to application of bioreductive prodrugs that 
are DTD substrates. 
The final section of this chapter 
provides an introduction to the work to be 
presented in Chapters 2 - 4. It also indicates the curent publication status of the work 
and the roles of collaborators in carrying out the work. 1.2 DTD 
DTD was fim characterized by Ernster and Navazio (1958) as a cytosolic-soluble 
diaphorase 
(catalyzing 
loss of 
color) 
using 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP) as a 
substrate and was discovered during snidies of the intracellular distribution of 
nicotinamide 
adenine 
dinucleotide reduced (NADFI)- and nicotinarnide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH)-dependent oxidoreductases. It was found that 
DTD utilizes both these cofactors, NADH and NADPH, with equal reactivity; the original 
nomenclature for 
these 
compounds was diphosphopyridine nucleotide reduced (DPNH) 
and triphosphopyridine nucleotide reduced (TPNH), respectively, hence the narne DT- 
diaphorase (Ernster et al ., 1960). 
Demonstration of DTD activity in cellular extracts or in intact cells has, in 
general, relied on the specific 
inhibitory 
effect of the anticoagulant dicumaroi (DIC) 
towards DTD. DIC is cornpetitive with respect to the electron donors NADH and 
NADPH (Ernster et al., 1960). A number of other names for the enzyme have arisen in 
the 
literature 
based 
on studies 
identieing 
genes coding for 
enzymatic 
activities using 
various 
substrates. The 
names 
include 
NAR(P)H:menadione 
reductase, 
quinone 
reductase 
and azo-reductase. A comrnon name for this enzyme, based on its Enzyme Commission 
(EC) classification, is NAD(P)H:(quinone acceptor) oxidoreductase 1 (NQO,) and its EC 
designation is 1.6.99.2. However, in this and subsequent chapters, the term DTD will be 
used fiom this point forward. 1.2.1 Molecular Biology of DTD 
The ability to puri@ DTD fiom various species by inhibitor-based afinity 
chromatography techniques (Rase et al., 1976) led to the availability of anti-DTD 
monoclonal 
antibodies 
(mAbs). Two groups (Williams et al., 1986; Robertson et al., 
1986), isolated rat DTD cDNA clones fiom protein expression Iibraries that were probed 
with anti-rat DTD rnAbs. Using rat DTD cDNA as a probe, Jaiswal et al. (1988) cloned 
the human DTD cDNA and localized the human DTD gene to chromosome 16 through 
human-hamster 
somatic 
ce11 
hybridization. 
Several 
overlapping cDNA 
clones 
were isolated from a human liver cDNA library 
giving a composite sequence of 2448 bp and containing a candidate open reading he 
(ORF) encoding a protein of 273 amino acids with a rnolecular weight of 30,880 Daitons 
(Da). The ORF within the composite human DTD cDNA sequence was followed by a 
long 3' untrznslated region (UTR) 1679 bp in length. The 3' UTR contains four potential 
polyadenylation signds 
(AATAAA) 
at positions 986. 1460. 1838, and 2419 bp. Northem 
blot 
anal ysis (Alwine et al ., 1 977) revealed mRNAs approxirnately 1 -2, 1.7, and 2.7 kb in 
size corresponding to the 
la, 
2", and 4th polyadenylation sites, respectively, in the human 
hepatocellular 
carcinoma 
ce11 
line, 
HepG2 
(Jaiswal et al., 1988). Sequence analysis 
indicated that the hurnan DTD cDNA and protein are 83 and 85% similar to the rat DTD 
cDNA and protein, respectively. 
Jaiswal (1991) also identified and characterized a number of genomic clones 
corresponding to the hurnan DTD gene by screening a Lphage based human liver 
genomic 
library 
with the human DTD cDNA. The human DTD gene is approximately 20 
kb in length and contains 6 exons interrupted by 5 introns (Figure 1.1). The first exon NF-kB AP-1 AP-2 TATA Exon 1 Exon 2 Exon 3 Exon 4 Exon 5 Exon 6

Figure 1.1: Schematic diagram of the human MD gene containing 6 exons and 5 
introns. The 5' flanking region contains a NF-& binding site, a consensus XRE site, a 
CCAAT box, an ARE (containing an AP-1 binding site), an AP-2 site, and a TATA box. 
The 3' region contains four potential polyadenylation site, three of which are used. 
Diagram 
based 
on work of Jaiswal et al. (1991) and Yao and O'Dwyer (1995). is 1 18 bp in length and codes for the initiating methionine and one G for the fmt codon 
of the second exon. The largest exon, exon 6, is 1833 bp in length. The extent of exon 6 
was based on subcloned gene fragments that were probed with short oligonucleotides 
derived fiom the cDNA sequence and, as expected, contained the four potential 
pol yadenylation sites. 
1850 bp of the 5' flankuig region were sequenced and shown to contain a TATA 
box at -34 bp, an activator protein (AP)-2 binding site at -157 bp, an AP-1 site at 462 
bp (within an antioxidant response element [ARE] at 447 bp), a CCAAT box at 645 bp, 
and a xenobiotic response element (XRE) starting at -740 bp. A NF-KB binding site was 
later localized at -820 bp (Yao and O'Dwyer. 1995). NF-& binding was demonstrated to 
play a role in MMC induction of DTD mRNA (peaking at 5-fold in 24 h) by 
electrophoretic 
mobility 
shift 
assay. This effect 
could 
be abrogated by 
prior 
immunodepletion of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-icB (Yao and O'Dwyer, 1995). 
A related form of human diaphorase, designated as NAD(P)H:(quinone acceptor) 
oxidoreductase 2 (NQO?), was identified by Jaiswal and CO-workers (1990) using a 
human DTD cDNA probe to screen a human liver cDNA library under low stringency 
hybridization conditions. 
Hurnan 
liver 
NQ02 cDNA and protein are 54% and 49% 
identical 
to 
DTD cDNA and 
protein, 
respectively. The NQ02 protein consists of 23 1 
amino acids (with a molecular weight of 25,956 Da). A single NQO? mRNA species of 
1.2 kb was identified and was not inducible by compounds that induce DTD transcription 
and is 50-100 times less active in reducing menadione than DTD. NQO, utilizes 
dihydronicotinamide 
riboside 0 instead of NAD(P)H as a cofactor (Wu et al., 1997). 1.2.2 Biochemical Functions of DTD 
At present, a definitive physiological role for DTD has not ken established. It is 
primarily a cytosolic enzyme with 5-10% of total cellular activity membrane-bound in 
mitochondrial, microsomal, and Golgi fiactions (Riley and Workman, 1992). The liver is 
the richest source of the enzyme but other tissues, including heart, lung, and kidney also 
exhibit 
varying DTD activities (Maritus, 1963). 
The enzyme functions as a homodimer with each subunit containing a non- 
covalently 
bound 
with a 
flavin 
adenine dinucleotide (FAD) prosthetic group. Li and co- 
workers (1995) detennined the crystal structure of rat liver cytosolic DTD by x-ray 
diffraction to 2.1 A resolution. Residues 1-220 in each monomer (Figure 1.2A) constitute 
a major catalytic domain with alternating a / f3 secondary structure (seven a-helices and 
seven 
f3-sheets 
separated 
by loop 
domains) 
while 
residues 
221-273 
represent a small C- 
terminal domain. Like other flavoproteins, the P-sheets tend to twist together and form a 
central 
core 
surrounded 
by a-helices but the overall topology does not resemble the 
cataIytic 
domain of other FAD-containing proteins. Rather, the topology of each 
monomer 
resembles Clostridiurn flavodoxin, a bacterial flavin mononucleotide- 
containing protein involved in electron transport (Martin et al., 1989) but without 
significant 
sequence 
identity 
with DTD. Recently, the crystal structure for human DTD 
has been determined (Faig et al., 2000). One of the major differences between rat and 
human DTD is the manner in which they bind FAD, rendering the rat isoform more 
efficient in mediating 
hydride 
transfer 
fiom 
the flavin group to the substrate. 
Identification of key residues involved in binding of DTD substrates, cofactors, 
and inhibitors based on its crystai structure provided insights into its reaction mechanism Figure 1.2: The secondary and tertiary structure of DTD. A) The structure of the 
monomer showing the a-helices (al - a8) and P-sheets (pl- B9) which are comected by 
loop domains (Ll-L7) that fold to form the monomer. B) Schematic showing two 
identical catalytic sites (black dots) fomed at the interface of the dimer by the Ll/L4 
(marked with an asterisk) region of one subunit aligning with the L3L5 region (marked 
with an asterisk) of the other subunit. Taken fiorn Rauth et al. (1 997) which was adapted 
from Li et al. (1995). and allowed the assignment of specific roles in the reaction mechanism to residues found 
in the active sites of DTD. Formation of two identical substrate binding sites (Figure 
1.2B). occurs upon dimerization of each D'Il3 monomer (Li et al., 1995). Dimerization 
ais0 
positions the 
isoalloxazine ring of FAD in an appropriate orientation for reduction of 
the substrate with anchoring interactions fiom loop domains contributed by each 
monomer. 
The active sites overlap with the NAD(P)H cofactor binding sites, accounting 
for the 'ping-pong' reaction mechanisms of DTD (cofactor on-off, then substrate on-off). 
Tyrosine 155 and histidine 16 1 stabilize the negative charge of the isoalloxazine ring of 
FAD as a result of hydride transfer from NAD(P)H. A second hydride transfer fiom 
FADH, to the quinone substrate results in a singly ionized hydroquinonolate product that 
again is stabilized by both active site residues. 
Early 
studies (Emster, 1987) suggested that one metabolic fùnction of DTD was 
in the biosynthesis of the natural forms of a quinone-containing vitamin (K2) and 
coenzyme Q (COQ, and COQ,,). The high sensitivity of DTD to anticoagulant dmgs such 
as DIC suggested a possible involvement in vitarnin K-dependent biosynthesis of 
prothrombin and related coagulants, with DTD serving as a vitamin K reductase to 
generate its hydroquinone 
form. 
This species 
can 
accept 
carboxyl 
groups to act as a 
carboxyl donor to peptides involved in prothrombin synthesis (Stenflo et al. 1974). 
In relation to its mitochondrial location, DTD was also implicated in the 
maintenance of membrane 
bound 
COQ 
in 
its 
reduced antioxidant state, thereby providing 
protection 
against 
fiee 
radical 
damage 
(Beyer et al., 1996). This hypothesis stemmed 
from 
studies involving homologues of COQ, including COQ, and COQ,,, incorporated into 
multilarnellar 
vesicles; the presence of DTD prevented the oxidation of reduced COQ and inhibited lipid peroxidation. This protective effect was inhibited by DIC. However, 
current views (Rauth et al., 1997) of the possible physiological role(s) of DTD focus on 
its dual nature as a bioreductive dnig activator and as a xenobiotic detoxifier. 
1.2.3 DTD as a Drug Activating Enzyme 
Contributions fiom the field of antimicrobials (Müller et al., 19761, dong with 
studies of MMC (Iyer and Szybalski, 1963) and the design of hypoxic-ce11 specific 
eiectron-afEnic 
radiosensitizers 
that 
react with radiation induced DNA radicals (Adams, 
1992), have led to the concept that bioreductive agents can be used as anti-cancer 
prodrugs. 
Interest 
in their 
mechanism 
of action as hypoxic ce11 cytotoxins resulted fiom 
their initial use as antimicrobiai agents (McCalla et al., 1970). The fact that 
nitroimidazoles and nitrofurans had a greater effect on anaerobic bacteria than on aerobes, 
coupled with the discovery of several nitroreductases in E. coli, two of which are oxygen- 
sensitive, 
ernphasized 
the importance of nitroreduction 
since 
the cytotoxic metabolite can 
revert back to the inactive prodrug in the presence of oxygen (Amis, 1957; Müller et al., 
1976). 
MMC (Figure 1.3), initially used as an antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces 
caespitous (Hata et al., 1957), was demonstrated by Iyer and Szybalski (1 963) to alkylate 
and crosslink DNA upon chemicai or enzymatic reduction. Sartorelli and CO-workers (Lin 
et al.. 1974) observed enhanced cytotoxicty of MMC under hypoxic exposure conditions. 
A mode1 of bioreductive activation of MMC, shown in Figure 1.3, was proposed to 
account for its differential cytotoxicity under hypoxic versus aerobic conditions Aziridine Ring Opning 
OH 
Figure 1.3: Proposed scheme for DTD activation of MMC and subsequent DNA 
crosslink damage adapted fiom Ross et al. (1993). subsequent to elucidation of its reaction mechanism (Iyer and Szybalski, 1964). DTD can 
reduce MMC in a concerted two electron and oxygen-independent process. However, 
MMC can k converted to its semiquinone radical form by one electron reductases such 
as NADPH:cytochrome P450 reductase, xanthine oxidase, cytochrome P450, aldehyde 
dehydrogenase. and NADH:cytochrome b, reductase (Sartorelli et al., 1994). Metabolism 
of MMC by one electron reductases is an oxygen-dependent process since the 
semiquinone form of MMC is susceptible to back oxidation to the parent prodmg by 
molecular oxygen. 
Such 
one electron reductases are thought to play a major factor in the selective 
hypoxic toxicity of MMC. Two electron reduction of the MMC prodrug, which bypasses 
semiquinone 
formation, generates a relatively redox-stable hydroquinone. However, the 
hydroquinone undergoes 
intemal 
rearrangement with the loss of a methoxy group 
followed 
by azindine ring 
opening 
thereby 
forming an electrophilic center at the C-I 
position (Figure 1.3). Alkylation of DNA results fiom attack of electrophilic C-1 by 
nucleophilic bases, 
especially 
by guanine and cytosine (Iyer and 
Szybalksi, 
1964). 
Subsequent loss of the 
carbarnate 
group of MMC generates another electrophilic center at 
the C-10 position and stimulates fiirther reaction with DNA leading to intra-strand 
linkage or crosslinking of complementary 
strands; the latter of which is thought to be the 
basis 
for the 
lethal 
effect of MMC. Tomasz and CO-workers (1987) have identified a 
number of specific rnonofünctional and bifunctional DNA adducts upon chernical or 
enzymatic 
activation of MMC. 
MMC typically displays only 1.5 - 3.0 fold hypoxic versus aerobic ce11 toxicity 
(Ross et al., 1993, in lems of concentration required to achieve 1 log ce11 kill). Gustafson et al. (1 996) determined the relationship between DTD levels and the toxicities of various 
bioreductive 
cytotoxins 
in 
Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human 
DTD. In this study, in agreement with previous reports (Riley and Workman, 1992), 
MMC was considered a poor DTD substrate since a saturation effect, i.e. the amount of 
MMC required to achieve one log ce11 kill, was constant at enzyme activities greater than 
500 nrnol2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP) reduced 1 min 1 mg protein. 
1.2.4 DTD as a Detoxification Enzyme 
DTD metabolizes a diverse range of substrates, including quinone-based 
xenobiotics that act as potential carcinogens via redox cycling and subsequent DNA 
darnage (Tikkanen et al., 1983; Chesis et al., 1984). As shown in Figure 1.4 for 
rnenadione, 
it 
has 
been demonstrated 
that a nurnber of endogenous and exogenous 
quinones are reduced by enzymes such as NADH: cytochrome b, reductase and NADPH: 
cytochrorne P450 reductase by one electron to semiquinones which can be readily 
reoxidized by molecular oxygen with concomitant formation of the superoxide radical 
(O,--) (Bachur et al., 1979; Powis et al., 198 1). By interaction with superoxide dismutase, 
the superoxide radical can be converted to hydrogen peroxide (HzO,) which subsequently, 
in the presence of intracellular metals such as ferrous ion, can be cleaved to give rise to 
DNA-damaging reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) such as the hydroxyl radical (OH.). 
ROIs have been shown to cause chromosomal damage and to act as mutagens and thus 
promote 
tumor 
progression 
(Cerutti, 1985). Conversely, H,O, can be cleaved by catalase 
to water. Quinone

Figure 1.4: Scheme for quinone detoxification by DTD illustrated with menadione. One 
step reduction of the parent quinone by DTD bypasses the formation of the relatively 
redox-labile semiquinone radical. The semiquinone is susceptible to back-oxidation to the 
parent 
quinone by reaction with rnolecular oxygen and subsequent generation of DNA- 
darnaging ROIS whereas the hydroquinone is relatively redox-stable and can be Mer 
metabolized and excreted. Adapted fiom Ross et al. (1 993). See text for details. Work by Lind and colleagues, using liver microsomes from normal and 3- 
rnethylcholanthrene (3-MCI a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAH] and a cornrnon 
industrial pollutant) treated rats, has demonstrated a relationship between one electron 
reductases 
and DTD in ROI toxicity (Lind et al., 1982). Treatment with 3-MC caused a 
several-fold 
increase 
in DTD activity without affecting the activity of 
NADPH:cytochrorne P450 reductase. Competition between the two enzymes was 
demonstrated in a spectrophotometric assay measuring NADPH levels where addition of 
menadione resulted in limiting the extent of NADPH oxidation; this decline occurred 
more rapidly in 3-MC induced than in control microsomes. Cellular response to DTD 
substrate exposure often results in an increase in DTD enzymatic activity. Early ches 
that 
this 
represents 
a protective response to the toxic effects of these substrates date back 
to the mid 1960's. Huggins and CO-workers discovered that treatment of mice with small 
doses of PAHs and other xenobiotics that act as DTD substrates caused an increase in 
DTD activity in the liver and other tissues. This rendered the mice resistant to the 
carcinogenic 
effects usually observed at higher doses of PAHs (Huggins et al., 1964 & 
1965). 
1.2.5 Su bstrate-Mediated Induction of DTD 
In al1 cases investigated to date, substrate-mediated induction of DTD activity has 
been shown to involve a net increase in newly synthesized DTD as indicated by increased 
mRNA levels (Pickett et al., 1984) and the ability to block induction with cyclohexamide 
(Lind and Ernster, 1977). In the late 1960's Nebert and CO-workers pioneered the concept of a molecular - genetic basis for the inductive response of various detoxiQuig enzymes 
in response to xenobiotic exposure, thereby contributing to the establishment of the field 
of pharmacogenetics (Nebert and Gelboin, 1968). This group concluded that the 
induction of DTD is controlled by the Ah (aryl hydrocarbon) locus encoding the aromatic 
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (Kumaki et al., 1977). This conclusion sternmed from their 
previous 
studies of other detoxification enzyme batteries (mainly the cytochrome P450s) 
which established a link between the Ah locus, the AHR and the aromatic hydrocarbon 
hydroxylase (AHH) enzyme system, and is based on correlative evidence of the 
upregulation of both AHH and DTD upon substrate exposure. 
Prochaska and 
Talalay (1 988) categorized the range of inductive compounds that 
can be metabolized by various enzyme batteries as bifunctional and monofunctional 
inducers. 
Bifunctiond 
inducers 
induce 
transcription of both Phase I and Phase II 
detoxifj4ng enzymes whereas monofùnctional inducers, which are highly electrophilic 
species and have a variety of chernical structures, induce transcription of Phase II 
enzymes only (reviewed by Begleiter et al., 1997). Phase 1 enzymes, which include the 
cytochrome 
P450s, 
create 
functional 
groups to generate more electrophilic and water- 
soluble species upon which Phase II enzymes can act (Prestera et al., 1993). In general, 
Phase II enzymes, which include glutathione S-tramferase (GST), and UDP- 
glucuronosyltransferase, participate in conjugation reactions of the newly created 
functional 
group to generate species that 
can be further metabolized and excreted (Figure 
1.4). DTD, although not serving as a conjugating enzyme, is considered to be a Phase II 
enzyme since it contributes to modification of xenobiotics to facilitate their elimination. Validation of the hypothesis that upregulation of enzyme batteries associated with 
xenobiotic detoxification involves a transcriptional induction process via an AHR-inducer 
complex 
arose 
fkom 
the discovery of the cis-acting xenobiotic response element O(RE) in 
the cytochrome P450c gene (Fujisawa-Sehara et al., 1987). It was confinned that DTD 
transcription induction can be mediated by the AHR upon identification of a cis-acting 
XRE by Jaiswal(1991) in the 5' flanking region of the human DTD gene at position -740 
(Figure 1.1). 
However, sequence analysis of the 5' UTR of the human DTD gene also revealed 
the presence of a single copy of another transcriptional enhancer element, an antioxidant 
response element (ARE, Figure 1.1)' previously shown to mediate transcriptional 
activation of genes 
such as GST in response to exposure to aromatic planar compounds 
and phenolic antioxidants (Rushmore and Pickett, 1990). Such compounds promote 
oxidative stress and generate a yet to be identified 'redox signal' (Prochaska and Talaiay, 
1988). Also, bifunctionai inducers, such as PAHs, which upregulate transcription of 
phase 1 enzymes, such as CYP IAI, via the XRE can be metabolized to generate radical 
species that alter the cellular redox state (Faweau and Pickett, 1993). This appears to lead 
to upregulation of phase II enzymes via the ARE. 
A theory emerged that the aforementioned redox signal promotes dimerization of 
products of the early responsive genes, c-Fos and c-Jun, to form an AP-1 complex 
(Mitchell and 
Tjian, 1989). This was based on the observation that AP-1 members can be 
activated by oxidative stress and the ARE core sequence is similar to the sequence 
recognized by AP-1 proteins. An AP-1 consensus site (TGACTCA) is present within the 
ARE starting at position 462 of the hman DTD gene promotor (Jaiswal, 1991, Figure 1.1). However, recent evidence suggests that a transcription factor consisthg of a 
NrfUsmall Maf heterodirner mediates the upregulation of phase 11 enzymes via the ARE 
(Itoh et al., 1997). This was initidly show by failure of phenolic antioxidants to 
upregulate GST and DTD transcription in nrf-2 knockout mice. The cytosolic protein 
Keapl has been demonstrated to sequester Nrf-2 in the cytosol, thereby supressing Nrf-2 
transcnptional 
activity 
until 
exposure 
to phase II enzyme 
inducers 
(Itoh et al., 1999). This 
implicates Keapl as a sensor for oxidative stress leading to the shuttling of Nrf2 to the 
nucleus to mediate induction of phase II enzymes. 
Begleiter and 
CO-workers 
are developing the concept of inducing DTD using 
analogues 
of 
1,2-dithiole-3-thiones in order to sensitize turnor cells to bioreductive drugs 
that require DTD activation. This group demonstrated that this approach provides larger 
increases in sensitization to agents 
such as MMC in tumor ce11 panels representing a 
number of different tissue types compared to normal cells of the corresponding tissue 
type 
(Dohem et al., 1998, Wang et al., 1999). The extent of induction varied between 
tissue types. The mechanism responsible for this variation is 
unknown 
but it may reflect 
differences in transcription factor levels, alternative splicing, or the presence of a base 
change at nucleotide 609 of the DTD coding region that is associated with low enzymatic 
activity . 
1.3 The RoIe of a Single Base Change at Nucleotide 609 of DTD cDNA 
Marshall et al. (1991) investigated the relationship between DTD activity and 
MMC sensitivity in a panel of five human skin fibrobIast strains donated by a cancer- 
prone 
fmily. 
Two of the fibroblast strains, 3437T and 3701T, were found to be approximately 6-fold more resistant to MMC than the other the stmins and cmtained 
low to 
undetectable 
DTD 
activity. Consistent with a saturation effect between DTD 
activity and MMC toxicity, the three MMC-responsive strains displayed similar MMC 
sensitivities despite possessing a wide range of individual DTD activities (400 - 1800 
nrnol DCPIP reduced / min / mg protein). Southern blot analysis of the human DTD gene 
in the 
MMC-resistant 
strains indicated no 
gross 
abnormalities. 
However, 
although 
Northem blot analysis indicated the presence of equal levels of the 1.2 kb DTD mRNA 
species between ce11 strains, Westem blot analysis demonstrated undetectable DTD 
protein in 343 7T and 3 70 1 T cells, suggesting that a pst-transcriptional or post- 
translational defect 
results 
in low to undetectable DTD protein levels in these two ce11 
strains. 
1.3.1 Identification of a 609C to T Nucleotide Substitution 
An expianation for the variation in DTD activities and MMC sensitivities 
observed in the 
ce11 
strains 
discussed 
above was provided by work by Traver et al. (1 992) 
using a panel of hurnan colon carcinoma cells which exhibited a range of DTD enzymatic 
activities. HT29 cells contained moderate to high DTD activity whereas BE cells 
displayed low to undetectable 
activity 
despite 
exhibiting similar levels of DTD mRNA 
expression (assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR). cDNA sequencing of these two ce11 
lines 
revealed that the only difference was in nucleotide position 609, a C nucleotide in 
HT29 cells and a T nucleotide in BE cells, resulting in a predicted proline to se~e 
change in 
amino 
acid 187. BE cells were homozygous for this substitution and did not 
display 
Westem blot 
reactivity 
to anti-DTD mAbs (although this group subsequently reported low levels of protein using more stringent Western blot conditions with protease 
inhibitors and prolonged cherniluminescence exposure time (Seigel es al., 199% 
suggesting that the DTD serine 187 isoform is unstable. 
cDNA sequencing of the aforementioned fibroblast ce11 strains taken from the 
cancer-prone family uncovered a homozygous nucleotide 609C to T change in 3701T 
cells, which were maximally resistant to MMC under aerobic conditions (Kuehl et al., 
1995). The remaining cells in the fibroblast panel were either homozygous for the 609C 
nucleotide or were heterozygotes. However, the other resistant ce11 strain, 3437T, was a 
heterozygote, which appeared inconsistent with the hypothesis that the proline 1 87 and 
serine 187 isoforms represent a wild-type and functionally impaired DTD, respectively 
(see Chapter 3). 
Based on the x-ray structure of rat DTD (Li et al., 1999, the proline 187 to serine 
change is located in the j35 region (Figure 1.2A) and therefore does not obviously 
participate 
in reactions involving the DTD active site nor does it appear to contribute to 
the 
dimerization 
process. Two groups reported kinetic studies of the serine 187 isoform 
puified 
fiom an E. coli expression system. Traver et al. (1997) reported that the senne 
187 isoform was only 2% as active as the wild-type enzyme, measured by DCPIP 
reduction. Wu et al. (1998) found it to possess a low but significant level of DCPIP- 
reductase 
activity - approximately 30-fold lower than the proline 187 isoform - thereby 
suggesting that the 609C to T nucleotide change constitutes a îùnctional mutation. Traver 
ef al. (1997) did not use menadione as a substrate to test the properties of their E. coli 
punfied 
serine 187 isoform, but Wu et al. (1998) reported it had 10-fold lower 
rnenadione-reductase 
activity 
than 
the proline 187 isoform. In addition, COS-1 monkey kidney cells, which contain undetectable background DTD activity, when msiently 
transfected with a mamrnalian expression vector containing wild-type DTD cDNA 
displayed on average 
IO-fold 
greater enzymatic 
activity 
compared to transfectants 
receiving mutant cDNA (Misra et al., 1998, see Chapter 2). In addition, mutant COS-1 
transfectants had at least a 3-fold reduction in protein levels compared to wild-type 
tram 
fectants. 
Both isoforms have similar Michaelis constant (&) values towards menadione 
and DCPIP but the serine 187 isoform has a 20-fold greater dissociation constant (K,,) 
value towards FAD (Wu et al., 1998). Therefore, the lower afkity of the serine 187 for 
the FAD prosthetic group may lx the basis for its defective enzymatic activity. Another 
possibility is that the mutation causes a change in enzyme conformation resulting in 
decreased enzymatic activity (Wu et al., 1998) andor stability (Traver et al., 1997). 
1.3.2 Frequency Analyses of the Nucleotide 609 Base Change 
The postulated roles of DTD as a dmg activating enzyme, as an anti-cancer 
defense 
mechanism, 
and as an antioxidant enzyme, coupled with the establishment of the 
609C to T nucleotide change as a fünctionai mutation, raises the issue that this mutation 
may be associated with disease arising fiom impaired DTD activity. Although the 
mutation wasn't identified at the time, Edwards el al. (1980) concluded that 4% of 628 
British unrelated individuals lacked a diaphorase activity that was later identified as DTD 
as detected by starch-gel electrophoresis and staining with NAD or FAD. 
Frequency studies of the nucleotide 609 base change (sumrnarized in Table 5.1) 
were aided by the development of a polyrnerase chah reaction - restriction fiagrnent length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP, Figure 3.1) screening assay that allows assignment of 
the genomic statu of the DTD 609C to T nucleotide change by virtue of the substitution 
resulting in a novel H& 1 recognition site (Eickelmann et al., 1994). An estimate of the 
fiequency of the DTD nucleotide 609 base change in the normal population was provided 
in a study of genomic DNA fiom 44 normal bone marrow donors where 9% of the 
subjects were homozygous for the mutation while 40% were carriers (Kuehl et al., 1995). 
Therefore, this base change is fiequent and a number of studies to date (Rosvold 
et al, 1995) in addition to the one by Kuehl et al. suggested that it was in accordance with 
Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium (Table 5.1 ). 
The hypothesis that the variant allele is associated with decreased DTD protein 
stability has been more definitive than its postulated role in disease, as evidenced by 1) 
lower DTD levels in marnrnalian cells transfected with the serine 187 isoform than in 
wild-type 
transfectants 
(Misra et al., 1998, see Chapter 2) 2) the absence of detectable 
DTD protein in biopsy material @th normal and tumor) homozygous for the nul1 ailele 
(Siegel er al., 1999) and 3) the observation of undetectable, or, at kt, minor levels of 
DTD protein in homozygous mutant ce11 lines (Phillips et al., 1995; Siegel et al., 1999). 
1.3.3 Heterogeeieity of DTD Enzymatic Activity and Chemotherapy 
The existence of a fiequent mutation that impairs DTD enzyrnatic huiction 
becomes important when 
using 
bioreductive 
prodrugs 
that 
depend 
on DTD activation. 
Although the association of the variant allele with the cancer phenotype is unclear, DTD 
enzymatic activity is heterogeneous across and within spectra of both normal and turnor 
tissue types (Belcourt et al., 1998; Siegel et al., 1999). Whether this heterogeneity is due to the prevalence of the mutant ailele or to other factors that control DTD expression 
remains to be determined. However, treatment modalities that involve bioreductive 
procimg 
therapy that 
depend 
on DTD activity should ensure that high levels of Dm 
protein are present. One such approach is substrate-mediated induction as proposed by 
Begleiter and CO-workers (discussed previously). This resulted in upregulation of both the 
proline and serine 187 DTD isoforms. One novel strategy is to deliver exogenous DTD to 
tumor cells through the use of vectors developed for gene therapy. 
1.4 Cancer Gene Therapy 
The concept of gene therapy originaily developed fiom the observation that some 
diseases are caused by the inheritance of one or two copies of a defective gene; it follows 
that 
such 
diseases are monogenic and therefore can be cured by insertion of a normal 
copy of the mutated gene (Roth and Cristiano, 1997). Since efficient delivery of 
therapeutic genes continues to be a major limitation to gene therapy, current gene 
replacement 
strategies 
are most effective for renewable 
ce11 
populations 
such as bone 
marrow stem cells 
(Kiem et al., 1995). Since cancer arises through a multi-step process 
culminating in a 
variety 
of genetic 
abnormalities, 
and it is 
beyond 
the capability of 
current gene therapy vectors to restore normal gene function to every ce11 in a tumor 
population, a more effective 
strategy 
may be to use gene therapy to deliver genes 
encoding cytotoxic products that 
specifically 
eliminate deleterious cancer cells (Roth and 
Cristiano, 1997). 1.4.1 Non-Vin1 Gene Therapy Vectors 
'The simplest fom of gene delivery does not involve use of synthetic molecules or 
a viral vector, but rather the delivery of naked DNA (Cheng et al., 1 993). This is usually 
done 
mechanically 
through 
direct injection or by high 
velocity 
bombardment with gold 
particles with DNA attatched. Although this method has resulted in gene expression in 
skeletal muscle tissue in vivo, it lacks targeting specificity at the cellular level. Expression 
is localized to the site of injection with the added disadvantage of low uptake eficiency 
in the targeted 
ce11 
population. This method 
can 
also be invasive since surgery is often 
required to allow access to the targeted tissue. 
Non-viral vectors have the 
common 
advantage of not 
king 
limited in the 
size 
of 
DNA that they can deliver (Roth and Cnstiano, 1997). Liposomes cm combine with 
DNA to form lipid-DNA complexes, which can improve the eficiency of DNA delivery 
to many ce11 types (Nabel et al., 1992). A wide vax-iety of synthetic liposomal vectors are 
available. and most are non-toxic and non-imrnunogenic (Nabel et al., 1993). However, 
the major drawback in the use of liposomes is the lack of targeting specificity towards 
specific 
ce11 
types, with transduction usually limited to the site of administration (Roth 
and Crisitano, 1997). Also, the lipid component of liposomes gives it a high propensity 
for 
non-specific 
uptake by 
cells of the reticuloendothelia1 system, resulting in short 
systemic half life (Wagner et al., 1990). 
The problem of targeting specificity of non-viral vectors has been partially solved 
by the development of gene delivery vectors composed of protein-DNA conjugates and 
the use of 
various 
ligands 
(Cnstiano, 
1993). A major limitation of protein-DNA complexes as a gene delivery vehicle is their inability to escape fiom endosornes 
subsequent to receptor-mediated endocytosis. 
1.4.2 Retroviral Gene Therapy Vectors 
Unlike liposomes and naked DNA vehicles, viral vectors have the advantage of 
tissue 
tropism, 
whether 
natural, 
or 
artificially 
through 
the use of packaging ce11 lines that 
supply viral envelope ligands for specific ce11 types (Bitzer et al., 1997). The remahder 
of this section describes some fiequently-used viral vectors as gene delivery vehicles. 
Retroviruses 
have an RNA genome which is converted to DNA upon host ceil 
infection and integration Field et al., 1996). The genome of simple retroviruses consists 
of 
three 
genes, termed gag, pl, and env, flanked by elements called long terminal repeats 
(LTRs) that act as viral transcriptional promoters/enhancers and also are needed for 
replication. Simple retrovirai-based gene delivery vectors are constructed by substituting 
the transgene for the gag, pol, and env regions (the LTR continues to provide 
transcriptionai 
induction). The requirement of 
ce11 
division for retroviral infection 
can be 
an advantage for cancer therapy. Also, there does not appear to be any pre-existing 
immunity 
to 
current 
simple 
retroviruses 
that are engineered for gene therapy. 
However, there are limitations of the use of simple 
retroviral 
vecton 
including 1) 
their inability to infect non-dividing cells; 2) their limited capacity (8 kb) for foreign 
DNA; 3) difficulties in large scale production - currently achievable titers are on the order 
of 10' 
particles I mL, which may be insuficient for the treatment of large tumon; 4) 
unstable levels of transgene expression, which has been known to shut off after five to 
seven days in some in vivo studies for unknown reasons (Verma and Somia, 1997); and 5) their Iimited host tissue range (Roth and Cristiano, 1997). Attempts to overcome the fifth 
limitation involves the technique of 'pseudotyping', in which packaging lines supply 
envelope 
proteins 
that 
have the desired host range (Yam et al., 1998). 
1.4.3 Basic Adenovims Biology 
Adenovirus infection has ken implicated to be the cause of a range of hurnan 
upper respiratory tract, eye, and 
gastrointestinal 
diseases 
(Straus, 1984). They are 
widespread in nature, infecting birds, 
many 
mammals and man. There are 2 genera of the 
Adenovindae family: Aviadenovirus 
(avian) 
and 
Mastadenovirus 
(mammalian). 
Many 
classification schemes have been 
used 
for 
members 
of the Adenoviridae 
family, 
with the 
serotype classification king the most common (Nermut, 1984). Each serotype elicits a 
di fferent set of serurn antibodies with some cross-reactivity between serotypes. The 
serum reactivity of each serotype is assayed by degree of haemagglutination of 
erythrocytes 
that 
carry 
various 
antibody 
sets. Mastadenovirus types 2 (Ad2) and 5 (Ad5) 
have been the most fiequently studied and their genomes have been completely 
sequenced; the remainder of 
this 
section 
will 
concentrate on 
these 
two 
viral types. 
Adenoviruses are non-enveloped and have an icosahedral symmetry (Figure 1.5) 
of around 90 nm in diameter with molecular weight estimates of the whole virus ranging 
fiom 175,000 - 185,000 kDa (Nemut, 1984). The icosahedral capsid shell consists of at 
least 10 different proteins to form 252 capsomeres that are partitioned into 240 'hexons' 
and 12 'pentons.' Hexons are the major component of adenovinws, accounting for 46% 
of the mas of the virus. Each hexon is 10.5-1 1 nm in length and consists of three 
polypeptides forming a triangular shape with a centrai channel in the middle that is 10-1 5 Figure 1.5: Gross morphology of adenovins capsid. The capsomeres consist of at least 
10 diflerent polypeptides. The virus has an overall icosahedral shape with 240 
capsomeres foming tripartite hexons and 12 capsomeres forming pentons. Hexons (1 0.5 
- f 1 nm in length) are the major molecular component believed to control the transport 
of solutes and larger molecules. Pentons consist of a 10 nm wide base supporting a fiber 
28 nm in length that is terminated by 42 A sphencal knob. The fiber and knob structures 
contain domains that attach to host cellular receptors. White and black triangles show two 
different groups of hexons each forming a triangular icosahedral face. Adapted from 
Nermut, 1984. A wide. It is thought that these channels give hexons a functional role, in addition to a 
structural 
one, by controlling the transport of solutes or larger molecules (such as 
enzymes) across the capsid. The 12 capsorneres at the vertices of the icosahedron are 
called pentons because they are surrounded by 5 neighboring hexons. Each penton is 
formed 
by a 10 nm wide base, a thin antema-like projection called a 'fiber' that is 28 nrn 
in length, with each fiber terminated by a spherical 'knob' that is 42 A in diameter. 
The adenovird genome consists of a linear DNA molecule around 36 kb in length 
which may aiso exist in a circular form mediated by the DNA terminal protein (TP), 
which is covalently attached to each 5' strand (Robinson et al., 1973). The entry of 
adenovirus 
into susceptible 
cells 
is 
sequential. 
The virion's 
fiber 
knob 
first 
attaches to a 
ce11 surface receptor. Fiber-mediated attachment of Ad2 and Ad5 has recently been 
show to occur through the major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC 1) and the 
coxsackievirus-adenovinis 
receptor (CAR) of the host (Bergelson et al., 1997). 
Intemalization requires the interaction of five conserved Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motifs at 
the piIton base with specific membea of the heterodimeric vitronectin-binding integrin 
family, a$, and a#, @ai et al., 1993). The virus is endocytosed via coated pits and 
vesicles and enters the cytoplasmic cornpartment within 5 to 10 min following absorption 
(Chardonnet and Dales, 1970). 
Very 
rarely 
do Ad2 and 5 integrate into the host genome. Rather, they continue as 
independent minichromosomes that acquire cellular histones (Kasamatsu and Nakanishi, 
1998). Before genome replication, adenovirai 
mRNAs 
are 
transcribed 
from 
the input 
DNA. The genome is commonly divided into 100 map units (mm) where one m.u. is 
approximately 365 nucieotides and O m.u. corresponds to the first base (Sussenbach, 1984). Because of the temporal nature of adenoviral transcription, mRNAs are classified 
as either immediate early (fiom Ela gene transcription), edy (fiom El b, E2& E2b, E3 
and E4 gene traascription as well as nom genes for some viral proteins), or late (from LI 
- L5 gene transcription, which are mostly for viral structural proteins). 
nie 
gene 
products 
of the El region have a number of interesting activities. Three 
splice 
variants 
of the E 1 a transcription unit have been identified (Pettersson, 1 984) and 
are the first mRNAs to be expressed? usually within 1 hour after infection. Two of the 
mRNAs encode a set of proteins ranging in molecular weight between 35 and 53 kDa. It 
is not known at present how each mRNA can specifj. two or more proteins that differ in 
molecular weight. The precise mode of action of the E1A proteins is unknown since they 
do not bind DNA, despite their ability to activate transcription. However, one of the 
pnmary functions of EIA proteins appears to be at the level of gene expression of early 
viral regions El b, E2, E3, and E4 as well as LI (McGrory et al., 1988). Two splice 
variants of the E 1 b transcription unit have ken identified (Pettersson, 1984); one encodes 
a 55 kDa protein, and the other a 19 kDa protein. 
EIA 
proteins 
are 
sunicient to induce transformation of primary cells in vitro by 
inducing oncogenic activity via the Ha-ras gene (McGrory et al., 1988). EIA may also 
mediate its oncogenic effect by binding to the himor suppressor p 105-RB (Boulanger and 
Blair, 199 1). E 1 B proteins do not transform cells on their own, but CO-operate with El A 
proteins to stably transform cells. During adenoviral infection, EIA proteins cause an 
accumulation of the 
tumor 
suppressor gene pS3 (Lowe and Ruley, 1993) which can 
tngger 
apoptosis; however, the El B 19 kDa protein subsequently acts as a functional 
homologue of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, whereas the EIB 55 kDa protein binds to and inactivates p5 3. Together. these observations indicate that adenovinises, in the course 
of sequestering cellular machinery, alter the intracellular environment to favor virai 
replication by preventing apoptosis. Oncogenesis is a rare outcorne as a result of these 
events (Boulanger and Blair, 199 1 ). 
At the onset of DNA replication, occurring as early as 6h post-infection, 
transcription 
switches 
pnmarily 
fiom 
the early to the late genes (Sussenbach, 1984). The 
five mRNA families transcnbed fiorn L1-L5 encode structural and or structure- 
supporting 
proteins 
for the virion and 
capsid, as welt as proteases involved in post- 
translational 
processing of 
late 
gene 
protein 
products. 
1.4.4 First Generation Ad5 Gene Thenpy Vecton 
The design of systems to create replication-defective recombinant Ad5 vectors 
that carry transgenes for gene therapy sternmed from extensive work examining the role 
of the El region in viral replication (see above) (McGrory et al., 1988). These studies 
usually invoived the 
construction 
of mutant El genes that were cloned into E. coli-based 
expression plasmids. Although the fùnctional consequences of these mutations could be 
studied by transfection of these plasmids into rnarnrnalian cells, it was more desirable to 
'rescue' the mutations made in cloned DNA into infectious virus. One widely used 
rnethod was to digest the viral DNA with a restriction enzyme that has a single cut site 
near the left end of the genome (within the El region), and then to ligate the large 
fragment 
to, or 
cotransfect 
it with, the expression plasmids containing mutated El 
sequences (Stow, 1981). However, this method is highly inefficient in that a large number 
of plaque isolates have to be screened to identiQ the desired mutant recombinant clone. A major contribution by Graham and CO-worken to these studies was the 
development of a more efficient technique to rescue El mutations into infectious ~d5 
(McGrory et al., 1988). Previous work by this group provided four impomt 
observations and developments that led to this technique; these were: 1) adenoviral DNA 
can 
circularize in idected cells; and this ability can be exploited to clone adenoviral 
genomes as bacterial plasmids that can generate infectious virus following transfection 
into mamrnaiian cells (Graham, 1984); 2) two cotransfected. non-infectious viral 
plasmids 
can 
recombine, 
without 
the need to 
first 
linearize them, and generate infectious 
virus 
(Ghosh-Choudhury et al., 1987); 3) the maximum amount of viral DNA that can be 
packaged into capsids is limited to only 2 kb in excess of the size of the wild-type 
genome; and 4) the development of a 293 human embryonic kidney ce11 line that is stably 
transfected 
with 
the 
leil 1 1% of the Ad5 genome and thus is able to support replication of 
E l defective recombinant adenovinis (Graham et al., 1 977). 
n+se observations and developments led to the construction of pJM 17 (McGrory 
et al., 1988, Figure 1.6), a non-infectious plasmid, which consists of the complete Ad5 
genome plus the 4.3 kb bacterial plasmid pBRX inserted at 3.7 m-u. (Figure 1.6A), which 
dismpts 
the El region and renders pM17 unable to mediate viral production in normal 
tells, and too large to be packaged in 293 cells. Since it is circular and contains the 
ampicillin resistance (ampR) and tetracycline resistance (tetR) genes, as well as a bacterial 
ongin 
of 
replication 
(on), 
pJM17 
can be grown in bactena in selective media and isolated 
in large quantities. pJM17 is approximately 2 kb in excess of the maximum amount that 
cm be packaged into adenovirus capsids, therefore it can only give rise to infectious 1 (0.5 - 3.7 m.u.) 
(78.3 - 85.8 m.u. , pBHG10)

recombination by overlapping El sequences resulting in an infectious plasmid incapable 
of generating replication-competent virus except in packaging ce11 lines such as 293 cells 
that supply E 1 proteins in trans. pJM 17 contains a bacterial plasmid, pBRX, inserted into 
the 3.7 m.u. position that interrupts the El region and renders it non-fiinctional. pBRX 
also contains ampR and tep genes that enable pJM17 to be cloned in bacteria in selective 
media. The desired insert is cloned into a shuttle vector in the region that contains an El 
deletion. Although both plasmids in this figure are represented as linear, they are 
transfected as circular. Adapted fiorn McGrory et al., 1988. B) pBHGlO and pBHG11 
contain 
deletions in both the El and E3 regions, allowing the incorporation of larger 
inserts than into pJM17. pBHGlO and pBHGl 1 also lack a Y packaging signal that can 
be restored only upon recombination with a shuttle vector containing Y, enswing that a 
replication-competent 
virus 
is not created.

pAElsplB and its MCS

Recombination 
between 
pJM17 
and a shuttle plasmid containing overlapping lefi 
end Ad5 sequences which 
displace 
pBRX 
(Figure 
1.6A) 
gives 
rise 
to an infectious 
plasmid 
much 
more efficiently 
(McGrory et al., 1988). If this shuttle plasmici contains a 
defective El region (which was the intention of the previously described studies 
involving rescue of E 1 mutations), the recombinant infectious plasmid will yield 
replication-defective 
virus 
in 293 cells, following homologous recombination. 
These 
recombinant 
vimes 
can 
replicate in 293 cells 
since 
El 
proteins are supplied in tram by 
the host ce11 genome. It is not known by what mechanism recombination occurs, but a 
likely possibility is that it involves linearization of both plasmids (McGrory et al., 1988). 
This strategy 
was the basis for the design of the fint generation replication- 
defective recombinant Ad5 systems. As illustrated in Figure 1.6A, an Ad 5 shuttle vector 
such as pAElspl B (Figure 1.6B), which contains Ad5 sequences from bp 22 to 5790 (O - 
16.1 m-u.) with a deletion of E 1 sequences fiom bp 342 to 3523 (1 -0 - 9.8 m.u.) aiong 
with a multiple cloning site (MCS) for minigene insertion, is cotransfected with an El - 
defective Ad5 packaging plasmid, such as pJM17, into a packaging ce11 line such as 293 
cells or Hela cervical carcinoma cells that supply El proteins in trans. The size of the 
minigene is 
resincted 
to 
around 2.3 kb if pJM 17 is used as the packaging vector. Further 
modifications in packaging plasmid design subsequent to the development of pJM17 
were created by Graham and CO-workers to accommodate larger rninigenes (Bett et al., 
1994). This involved deletions of the El and E3 region where E3 is nonessential for viral 
replication and 
both 
can be deleted and still produce a functional vector (Berkner and Sharp, 1983). The E3 gene is believed to fûnction by circurnventing the immune response 
towards adenovirai infection by binding to MHC 1 and interferhg with antigen 
presentation during immune surveilIance (Schowaiter et al., 1997). 
As shown in Figure 1.6B, the pBHGlO and pBHGl 1 packaging vectoa (Ben er 
al., 1994) do not contain the complete Ad5 genome as with pJM17. These packaging 
vectors have deletions in the El region (fiom bp 188 to 1339 (0.5 - 3.7 m.u.)) and in the 
E3 region (fiom bp 28,133 to 3O,8 18 [78.3 - 85.8 m.u.1 for pBHGlO and fiom bp 27,865 
to 30,995 [77.5 - 86.2 m.u.1 for pBHGl1). The use of these modified packaging vectors 
results in a 
capacity 
for inserts of up to 8.3 kb. Minigenes can be incorporated into the El 
or E3 deletions or both. 
The deletions in the E L region (AE 1 ) of pBHG l O and 1 1 removes the cis-acting Y 
packaging signal (AY) required for virion assembly (Ben et al., 1994) and cm only be 
restored upon recombination with a Y-containing adenoviral shuttle vector. This 
requirement adds an extra safety feature in ensuring that the rare event of recornbination 
between the packaging vector and the host El region does not yield a replication- 
competent virus, 
because of lack of the Y signal. In the present work the pAElsplB 
shuttle vector and the pJM17 packaging vector were utilized (see Chapter 4). 
1.4.5 Rationale for Combination of Gene and Bioreductive Drug Therapy 
One of the first applications of the idea of seiective transduction of tumor cells 
with a gene whose product converts a prodrug to a cytotoxic metabolite was the use of a 
retrovirus carrying the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene which 
activates the nucleoside analogue gancyclovir (Culver et al., 1992). It was found in vivo that HSV-TIC therapy resulted in significant tumor mass regression despite observations 
that only a 
small 
fraction of the tumor was infected with the retrovirus (Freernan et al., 
1993). This cytotoxic effect mediated by transduced cells towards non-transduced cells 
has been termed a 'bystander effect.' In the case of HSV-TK and gancyclovir, the 
ac tivated metabolite, ganc yclovir-triphosphate, is transferred fiom cell to ce11 through gap 
j unctions (Bi et al., 1 993). Ad5 .HSV-TK in combination with gancyclovir has recentl y 
been show to be effective in the treatment of human prostate (Martiniello-Wilks et al., 
1998) and retinoblastoma (Hurwitz et al., 1999) tumors in mice. 
Bioreductive hg thetapies have traditionally been designed to: 1) take advantage 
of tumor hypoxia to provide selective drug activation; andor 2) exploit individual 
differences 
in 
reductase 
levels in 
order 
to 
utilize 
a 
particular 
bioreductive agent. 
Workman and Stratford (1993) suggested that examination of enzyme levels in a 
particular individual prior to choosing a bioreductive agent could provide an optimal 
enzyme-drug match, a strategy they termed 'enzyme profiling.' However. to overcome 
the invasiveness (due to the need to obtain tissue biopsies) and time delay (due to growth 
of ce11 strains and assaying for enzyme activities) associated with enzyme profiling, 
approaches to de1iver and over-express a given bioreductive enzyme in tumor ce1ls 
including 
engineered 
viruses 
are in development. 
Studies with CB1954 (Figure 1.7), synthesized at the Chester Beatty Institute in 
England in the late 1960s demonstrated cure of rodent in vivo turnours of the Walker 256 
carcinoma ce11 line (Cobb et al., 1969). Although CB1954 was shown to have high 
potency against Wdker turnor cells, it was ineffective against a range of human tumor DTD

al. (1993). xenografts (Workman et al., 1986). Knox and CO-workers (1991) showed that the 
sensitivity of Walker 256 tumors to CB f 954 resdted fiom efficient activation of the dmg 
by high levels of rat DTD where the 4-hydroxylamine group of reduced CB1954 can 
further 
react with intracellular thiols to generate a reactive center for DNA alkylation 
(Figure 1.7). DNA crosslinking car, result via the electrophilic 5-aziridinyl and the newly 
generated 4-amide groups. The 
4-hydroxylamino 
form 
of CB 1954 (generated after four 
electron 
reduction by 
reductases 
such as DTD, Knox et al., 1993, Figure 1.7) has also 
been shown to induce a bystander effect in vitro (Bridgewater er al., 1997) making it an 
attractive candidate for gene therapy involving enzymes that 
eficiently 
metabolize 
CB1954. Conditioned media taken fiom cells transduced with enzymes able to activate 
the prodnig and treated with CB1954 has been shown to be cytotoxic toward non- 
transduced cells. However, 
unlike gancyclovir-triphosphate, the 4-hydroxylamino 
derivative 
of CB1954 mediates its bystander effect via aqueous media with cellular 
uptake by passive diffusion and, therefore, does not involve gap junctions (Bridgewater et 
ai., 1997). 
Knox and colleagues investigated the basis for the difference in CB1954 
sensitivity between human and rat nimors in vitro using ce11 line panels that contained 
similar 
levels of DTD (Boland er al., 1991). Human ce11 lines were sirnilarly affected by 
the 4-hydroxylamino (activated) form of CB1954 as rat cells suggesting that their 
resistance was not due to further inactivation of the hydroxylamine group nor to intrinsic 
resistance to the formation of DNA adducts. Therefore, it was proposed that human DTD 
was ineficient at activating the parent CB1954 prodnig. Studies with rat and human 
DTD purified to homogeneity revealed that the human isoform was indeed less able to carry out the reduction of the CB1954 prodrug to the 4-hydroxylamho derivative. The 
rat isoform displayed a catalytic constant &J value more than 6-fold higher than the 
hurnan isoform. 
The rat isoform has been shown to be more effective than the human isoform in 
reducing a number of bioreductive agents, including MMC (Siegel et al., 1990). Chen et 
al. (1 997) created rat-human DTD chimenc enzymes to determine the region of DTD that 
is responsible for the 
catalytic 
difference. 
Initially, 
this was done ushg large regions 
spanning 
the rat 
amino 
and carboxyl terminal sequences, and it 
was 
found 
that the latter 
region 
determined DTD catalytic activity. A senes of rat and hurnan DTD mutants 
containing 
minor 
substitutions in the carboxyl 
region 
were 
generated 
and 
analyzed. 
Of 
the 26 amino acid differences in the carboxyl region between the rat and human form, 
amino 
acid 104 
(glutamine (Q) in human and tyrosine (Y) in rat) was the most important 
residue responsible for the catalytic differences 
between 
the rat and 
human 
enzymes; a 
human DTD mutant with a glutamine to tyrosine substitution in amino acid 104 
(hQ104Y) behaved like the rat enzyme in its ability to metabolize CB 1954, making it an 
attractive prodrug-enzyme combination for gene therapy or delivery by conjugated 
anti body. 
In addition to 
hQ104Y, 
two 
other 
enzymes have been 
identified 
recently 
that are 
more 
efficient 
in the metabolic activation of 
CB1954 
than DTD. E. coli nitroreductase 
(NTR) has 90-fold greater catalytic activity towards CB1954 than DTD (Bailey SM and 
Hart IR, 1997). A recombinant retrovirus carrying NTR cDNA dong with CB 1954 has 
demonstrated a marked bystander effect where treatment of mixed populations consisting 
of 50% each of transduced and non-transduced tumor ce11 lines resulted in complete ce11 killing (Green et al., 1997). Hurnan NQO, has a very high activity towards CB1954, 
being 3000-fold more effective than DTD in CB1954 reduction (Wu et al., 1997). TO 
date, use of NQO in gene therapy has not been reported. 
Therefore, 
enyme-prodrug therapy involving overexpression of an appropriate 
reductase in 
tumor 
cells may represent a solution to the problem of heterogeneity in 
reductase 
expression 
among 
cancer patients. This approach 
has the advantage of being 
re lativel y non-invasive. 
1.5 Thesis Outline 
The purpose of the work presented in this thesis was to examine the role of DTD 
as a prodrug-activating enzyme. Three specific aspects of DTD activity were studied: 1) 
the effect of a DTD 609C to T nucleotide change on DTD activity and protein stability; 2) 
the use of this base change as a prognostic indicator for cellular responses that are 
mediated by DTD; and 3) the feasibility of using Ad5 gene therapy to deliver DTD 
activity to tumor cells to render them drug sensitive. 
C hapter 2 describes transient transfection studies of rnammalian COS- 1 cells with 
a plasmid vector resulting in high expression of a DTD minigene with or without the 
nucleotide 
609C 
to T change. Since COS-1 cells contain undetectabie background DTD 
activity, 
these 
experiments provided for direct cornparisons of the cellular enzyme 
activities and 
protein 
stabilities of the proline and serine 187 DTD 
isofoms. 
This work 
has been published in the British Journal of Cancer (Misra et al., 1998). 
Chapter 3 describes studies to determine if the allelic status of the 609C to T 
nucleotide change can predict DTD activity, and thus its use as an indicator for degree of drug activation and xenobiotic detoxification medîated by the enzyme. This issue was 
assessed by examining the relationship of allelic status and DTD enzyme activity in 45 
human 
skin 
fibroblast 
ce11 
strains 
that were provided by Nancy 
Cracknell 
and Dr. Peter 
Ray (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto). An explanation for the unique observation 
that 3437T cells are heterozygous for the 609C to T nucleotide change yet contain low to 
undetectable DTD activity and trace amounts of DTD protein is provided. This work was 
performed with the help of a summer student, Annic Grondin, and has been accepted for 
publication in the 
British 
Journal of Cancer. 
Appendix 3.1 provides a table of the 
characteristics of the human ce11 strains used for the studies described in Chapter 3. 
Chapter 4 addresses the feasibility of the use of DTD in an Ad5-directed cancer 
gene therapy approach. Ad5 vectors were designed to express the proline or serine 187 
DTD isoform under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The relationship 
between 
multiplicity 
of infection and recombinant DTD protein expression as well as its 
expression kinetics in 
tems 
of enzyme activity were examined in BE cells. The 
possibility of a dominant negative effect mediated by the DTD 609T allele was tested by 
infection of HT29 cells with Ad5 carrying DTD cDNA encoding the serine 187 isoform. 
FuI-thermore, the degree of MMC sensitization of BE cells infected with an Ad5 vector 
carrying a minigene for the proline 187 DTD isoform was deterxnined using an in vitro 
colony formation assay. The MMC sensitivity of these transduced BE cells was compared 
with MMC-sensitive HT29 cells. This work will be submitted to the International Journal 
of Cancer. 
Chapter 5 provides a summary and discussion of the experimental results in 
context with progress in the field during the course of the work described in Chapter 2, 3, and 4. As well, possible fiiture experiments are described for fùrther investigation into the 
nature of the serine 187 DTD isofonn and the use of DTD in Ad5-directed enzyme- 
procimg gene therapy. Appendix 5.1 describes initial experiments exploring the relative 
transduction 
efficiencies 
of recombinant Ad5 vectors in human tumor cells in hypoxic 
versus 
aerobic conditions. 1.8 References

Role of a Base Change at Position 609 2.1 Abstract 
DT-diaphorase (Dm) is a homodimeric flavoenzyme that can provide a defense 
mechanism 
against 
carcinogenesis mediated by dietary or environmental quinones as well 
as bioactivate quinone-containing chemotherapeutic dmgs. Huma. ce11 lines and strains 
have been identified with very low to undetectable enzymatic activity associated with a C 
to T transition at nucleotide 609 of the DTD cDNA. This single base change is predicted 
to result in a proline to serine change in arnino acid 187. Human cells homo ygous for 
this base transition 
fail 
to 
exhibit 
Western blot reactivity for DTD, suggesting that this 
substitution results in protein instability. To test directly whether this base change affects 
DTD enzymatic activity and/or protein stability in vivo, mammalian expression vectors 
c;ontaining 
DTD 
cDNA with or without the nucleotide 609 base transition were 
transiently 
transfected 
into 
COS-1 cells. Cotransfection with a human growth hormone 
(hGH) 
expression vector 
allowed 
normalization 
for transfection efficiency. 
COS-1 
transfectants expressing the C to T base change displayed at least 10-fold less DTD 
activity (p < 0.001) and 2- to 3- fold lower protein levels as compared to wild-type 
transfectants. 
These 
results 
provide, 
for the 
first 
time, evidence that DTD protein 
encoded by the C to T 609 base transition can be detected in marnmaiian cells and 
confirm that this protein has reduced enzymatic activity. 
2.2 Introduction 
DTD [NAD(P)H (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, with or without 
phosphate):quinone 
oxidoreductase (NQO ,), Enzyme Commission No. 1.6.99.21 is a 
homodimeric 
flavoprotein that acts on its substrates by two-electron reduction (Emster, 1967). It utilizes a wide range of substrates, such as aromatic nitro and nitroso 
cornpounds, phenolic 
antioxidants. 
azo 
dyes, and quinone-containing compounds (Ross et 
al., 1993; Horie, 1990). Reduction of the quinone ring to its semiquinone radical form 
can be mediated by one-electron reductases such as NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase 
and NADH:cytochrome b, reductase (Powis, 1987). However, DTD converts the parent 
quinone 
to its 
hydroquinone form in a single step two-electron transfer reaction, thereby 
bypassing semiquinone radical 
formation 
(Iyenagi, 1987). Redox cycling 
between 
the 
parent 
quinone and the semiquinone species in aerobic cells has ken implicated in 
carcinogenesis (Koster, 
1 
99 1 ). Reduction of various dietary and environmental quinones 
by DTD rnay protect DNA and cellular organelles against insults fiom reactive oxygen 
intermediates (Powis, 1987; Lind et al., 1992; Chesis et al., 1984). Conversely, a nurnber 
of quinone-containing chernotherapeutic 
drugs 
such as MMC, the indoloquinone E09, 
and the aziridinylquinones can be activated by DTD (Begleiter et al., 1992; Walton et al., 
1992; Siegel et al., 1990) into DNA alkylating agents by conversion to their 
hydroquinone 
forms 
in a single step 
two-elecwn 
transfer 
reaction. 
In the BE human coIon carcinoma ce11 line, a homozygous C to T base transition 
in nucleotide 609 of DTD cDNA has ken implicated in causing low to undetectable 
DTD activity (Traver et al., 1992). A wide range of DTD activities was observed in 
human fibroblast strains taken fiom a cancer prone family and unrelated donors (Marshall 
ei al., 1991). DTD activity appeared to be related to the allelic status at nucleotide 609 (C 
or T) in these strains, furiher suggesting that this substitution may impair enzyme activity 
(Kuehl et al., 1995). In addition, the BE ce11 Iine and human ce11 strains which have no or 
very low DTD activity expressed nomal mRNA levels but no DTD protein could be detected with polycloaal ador monoclonal antibodies directed against DTD (Traver et 
al.. 1997: Marshall et al., 1991). To test the hypothesis that this base change impairs 
DTD enzymatic activity, mammalian expression vectors containing DTD CDNAS 
(derived 
fiom 
cells that are 
homozygous 
for 
either 
the C or T nucleotide at position 609) 
were prepared and transiently transfected into COS- 1 monkey kidney cells which express 
very low ievels of endogenous DTD activity. Analysis of recombinant DTD protein 
levels 
and enzymatic 
activity 
in transfected COS-1 
ce11 
iysates 
ailowed for a direct 
examination of the effect of the C to T transition on DTD protein stability and fiinction. 
2.3 Materials and Methods 
2.3.1 Chemicals and Reagents 
DCPIP, DIC, FAD, bovine serum albumin, B-NADPH, Tween-20, and Tris-HCl 
were obtained 
from 
Sigma 
Chernical 
Co. (St. Louis, MO). Lipofectamine reagent was 
obtained from Life Technologies Inc. (Gibco-BRL, Burlington, ON, Canada). 
Recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) levels in culture medium were determined 
using a 
commerciaily 
available 
mdioimmunoassay 
kit 
(loldan 
Diagnostics, Aurora, ON, 
Canada). Hybridoma supematants containing a mixture of two anti-DTD monoclonal 
antibodies 
(B771, 
rat/human DTD reactive; A180 human DTD specific) as well as 
purified human recombinant DTD were supplied by Dr. David Ross (University of 
Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). 2.3.2 Preparation of Euhyoîic Expression Vectors 
Total RNA was isolated fiom the human fibroblast ce11 strains GM38 and 3701T 
which are homozygous for the C and T nucleotide at position 609, respectively, as 
previously described (Kuehl et al, 1995). Bnefly, reverse transcriptase @T)-PCR was 
used to ampli@ cDNAs using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco) and AmpliTaq 
polymerase 
(Perkin 
Elmer, 
Norwaik CT) corresponding to the DTD open reading frame 
using the following primers: 
5' DTD sense: ATGCAAGCTAATCAGCGCCCCGGACTG (bases 23-40 of NQO,; 
Hind III restriction site indicated by underline); 
3'DTD 
antisense: CGACGTCGACAAGGAAATCCAGGCTAAGGA (bases 879-898 of 
DTD; Sa1 1 site indicated by underline). 
As 
show 
in Figure 2.1, the resdting 895 base pair fragments @TD 609C or T), 
containing the full-length DTD coding region were inserted into the Hind III and Sal I 
sites of pBAPr-1 -ne0 (Invitrogen Co., San Diego, CA) (Kuehl, 1995). However, in these 
constructs the DTD cDNA is in the wrong orientation with respect to the p-actin 
promoter of 
pf3APr-1 
-neo. 
These 
constructs were subsequently digested with 
K~nd III and 
Sa1 1 to release DTD cDNAs, which were then gel-purified and subcloned into the 
promotor-less plasmid 
pBLCAT3 and designated as pBLCAT3.DTD (Invitrogen Co.). 
This plasmid provided Hind III and Xba 1 sites flanking the DTD inserts to allow their 
cloning in the proper orientation with respect to the CMV promoter of pRcICMV. The 
DTD cDNA inserts were isolated and gel-purified by digestion of pBLCAT3.DTD with 
Hind III and Xba I and ligated into the pRc/CMV expression vector (Invitrogen Co.). Figure 2.1 : Cloning scheme for p~c/~~~.~~~M>9C and ~RC/CMV.DTD~~, shown on 
the following pages. ppAPr-1-neo.DTD contained DTD cDNA (609C or T) in improper 
orientation with respect to the 
B-actin 
promoter. DTD cDNA inserts were 
released by 
digestion with Hind III and Sa1 1 and ligated into these sites in pBLCAT3 resulting in 
pBLCAT3.DTD. 
The flanking Hind III and Xba 1 sites allowed cloning of the DTD 
inserts in proper orientation with respect to the CMV promoter of the mammalian 
expression vector 
pRc/CMV. 
The Hind III - Xba 1 fiagrnent containing the DTD cDNA 
was inserted into these sites in pRc/CMV to yield ~Rc/CMV.DTD- and

Constructs were purified for transfection experiments by two rounds of CsCl continuous 
density gradient centrifugation. The sequence 
integrity 
of 
~RC/CMV.DTD~ 
and 
~Rc/CMV.DTD~'~~ 
were verified by Sanger sequencing of both strands using Sequenase 
Version 2.0 T7 DNA polymerase (United States Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). 
2.3.3 Cell Culture 
COS-1 monkey kidney cells were obtained fiom the Amencan Type Culture 
Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Alpha Minimum Essential Medium 
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine senim (FBS, Sigma Chernical Co., St. Louis, MO, 
growth medium) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 
37°C. 
2.3.4 Transient Transfection of DTD cDNA 
COS4 cells were seeded on 100 mm diarneter tissue culture dishes (NUNC, 
Denmark) 24h pior to transfection at a density of 90-100 cells/mm2 in growth medium 
and maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Lipofectamine 
transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Gibco-BRL). 
Briefly, transfections were performed using 20 pL (2 mg / mL) Lipofectamine and 5 pg 
of ~P,C/CMV.DTD- or ~RC/CMV.DTD~~ coûansfected with 5 pg of pXGH5 (Selden 
el al., 1986, Figure 2.2) in 1.6 ml, of antibiotic-fiee Alpha Minimal Essential Medium. Figure 2.2: Schematic of pXGHS hGH expression vector, used to monitor transfection 
efficiency. This vector 
provides 
for 
hGH 
secretion 
under 
control 
of the 
mouse 
metallothionein-1 
promoter (mMT-1). It also contains a MCS to allow cloning of gene 
expression regulatory elements where hGH secretion acts as a reporter. Adapted fiom 
Seldon et a[., 1996. Mock-trans fected cells (Lipo fectamine only) and vec tor-control transfectants @Rc/CMV 
vector 
alone) 
were 
similarly 
treated. 
Cells were incubated with this mixture for 5h, 
followed by an overnight incubation with the addition of 10% FBS at which the the 
medium was replaced with fkesh growth medium. Twenty-four hours later, an aliquot of 
growth 
medium was retained for analysis of recombinant hGH levels and cells were 
harvested for recombinant DTD enzymatic assays. 
2.3.5 Assay for DTD Enzymatic Activity 
Transfectants were harvested by scraping, centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min at 4"C, 
resuspended in 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed by exposure to five 10 s 
ultrasound pulses at 10 s intervals using a Vibra Ce11 sonicator (Sonics and Materials, 
Danbury CT). Total ce11 extracts were centrifuged in an Eppendorf (Rexdale, Ontario, 
Canada) 541 5 C microcentrifuge at 16000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supematants 
were retained. DTD activity. expressed as nrnol/min/mg total protein, was determined 
according to a modification (Kuehl et al., 1995) of an assay developed by Benson el al. 
(1 980) and is expressed as dicumarol inhibitable activity measured by the loss of DCPIP 
at 600 nrn. DTD activities in ce11 extracts were determined in the presence of 35 pM 
DCPIP in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.23 rng/mL bovine serum 
albumin, 0.2 rnM NADPH, 0.01% Tween-20,4 pM FAD, with or without 25 pM DIC. 
Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method (1 976). 2.3.6 Western Blot Analysis 
COS-1 cells were transfected with DTD expression vectors, grown to a density of 
4 x 10' cells in 100 mm diameter tissue culture dishes, and harvested by scraping in 2 
mL PBS. Half the ce11 suspension was used to determine DTD activity as described above 
while 
the 
remaining 
half was used for Western blot analysis (Bumette, 198 1 ). Ce11 lysates 
were 
prepared by resuspending ce11 pellets in 200 pL ce11 harvest buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCI, 
1% SDS , 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM DTT) and incubation in a boiling water bath for two 
minutes. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method (1976) and 
protein (20 pg / lane) was separated by 12 % SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 
eIecîro- 
transferred 
to nitrocellulose membranes. Following 
tram 
fer, membranes were 
blocked in 
Tris-buffered 
saline (TBS) containing 5% skim milk powder and 1% heat- 
inactivated FBS for 2h, and then incubated overnight with 15 mL of hybridoma 
supernatant 
containing a mixture of two of the anti-DTD monoclonal antibodies at 4°C. 
Blots were washed in TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and incubated for 90 min with a 
1 :4000 dilution of goat anti-mouse home radish peroxidase conjugated antibody in TBS 
containing 1% skim rnilk powder and 1% heat-inactivated FBS. Bands were visualized 
using an enhanced chemilurninescense detection kit (Amersharn Life Science, Oakville 
ON. Canada) and autoradiography. Purified human recombinant DTD (20 ng) was 
included as a positive molecular weight control. Densitometric analysis was pedormed 
using a Computing Densitometer and ImageQuant v. 3.3 software package (Molecular 
Dynarnics, Sunnyvale, CA). Band densities were quantified in ng relative to a positive 
molecular weight control. 2.3.7 Statistical Analysis 
DTD activity was expressed as nmol/min/mg proteinhg hGH. Two-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the means of enzymatic activities in COS-1 
ce1 1s transfected with either p~c/~MV.~~~m>C or ~RCICMV.DTD~~. Data were 
evaluated as 2 treatments @Rc/CMV.DTDm or ~RC/CMV.DTD~~ ) each represented 
by 3 separate experirnents. Two-way ANOVA allows comparkon of means of treatments 
by separating the intra-experhental variation fiom inter-experimental variation. 
2.4 Results 
2.4.1 Expression of DTD- and DTD- in COS4 Cells 
COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with eukaryotic expression vectors 
(Figure 2.1) 
containing 
DTD 
cDNAs 
prepared 
from 
skin 
fibroblast 
strains 
homozygous 
for either the C or T nucleotide at position 609 (Kuehl et al., 1995). Untransfected COS- 
1 cells displayed low levels of DTD activity (within the limit of detection of the assay) as 
did mock-transfected and vector control-transfected cells (mean 4 s.e.m. of three 
determinations: 3.6 f 1.3; 3.3 + 1.3; and 2.0 i 0.3 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively). 
DTD activities of COS-1 cells transfected with pRc1CMV.DTDm were significantly 
higher than controls, ranging frorn 70- to 130- fold greater than vector control-transfected 
cells. Cells transfected with pRc/CMV.DTDmT , on the other hand, had DTD activities 
that were only 8-fold elevated relative to vector controls and were substantially lower 
t han PRCIC MV.DTD- - transfected cells. When corrected for average background 
enzymatic activity, two-way ANOVA indicated that DTD activities in cells transfected wi th p~c/~~~ .DTD- were signi ficantly different (p<<O.00 1 ) than cells transfected 
with 
p~~/C~V.DTDm. 
To 
control 
for the possibility that differences in 
DTD 
activities mise fiom 
differences in transfection efficiencies, cells were simultaneously transfected with the 
pXGHS plasmid, which provides for recombinant hGH expression from the rnouse 
metallothionein-1 
promoter 
(mMP-1). Two-way ANOVA indicated that recombinant 
hGH levels were similar in ce11 strains transfected with either pRc/CMV.DTDMPC or 
p~~/~~~.~~~609T @ » o. 1 ). 
DTD activities were nomalized to recombinant hGH levels (transfection 
efficiency) and two-way ANOVA confirmed that DTD activities in ~RC/CMV.DTD- 
and ~RC/CMV.DTD- transfectants were significantly different @<<0.001) (Figure 2.3). 
COS- 1 cells transfected with ~RC/CMV.DID~ displayed mean + s.e.m. DTD activities 
of 260 t 37 nmoWmin/mg proteinhg hGH, which were 10-fold greater than activities 
observed in 
~RcICMV.DTD~"~~ 
transfectants (25 + 15 nmol/min/mg proteidng hGH). 
These results confirmed that DTD cDNAs containing a T nucleotide at position 609 
encode a DTD protein with reduced enzymatic activity. 
2.4.2 Western Biot Aoalysis 
To examine whether the C to T nucleotide substitution Ieads to decreased protein 
stability, recombinant DTD 
protein 
levels in COS4 cells transfected with either the 
p~c/~~~.~~~W9C 
or 
~RCICMV.DTD- 
constructs 
were 
also 
exarnined. As

of five densitornetric readings for each lane standardized to rDTD. pR~/CMV.DTD6m transfected ce11 extracts demonstrated that both mutant and wild- 
type recombinant 
DTD are expressed at high levels in COS-1 cells. The mutant DTD 
protein appears to run slightly faster than the wild-type DTD protein and densitometery 
(Figure 2.4B) indicated that ~Rc/CMV.DTD- transfectants contained approximately 3- 
fold greater DTD protein than ~RC/CMV.DTD~~ transfectants. However, the rnean 
amounts of expressed recombinant DTD protein per 20 pg of total protein loaded fiom 
~Rc/CMV.DTD- - transfected cells and ~RC/CMV.DTD~ - transfected cells were 
estimated to be 240 and 80 ng, respectively. These results suggest that lower mutant 
DTD enzyme activities cannot be entirely accounted for by a decrease in protein 
stabilities, as discussed below. 
2.5 Discussion 
DTD has been show to reduce quinone-containing chemotherapeutic dnigs such 
as MMC and the indoloquinone E09 to their hydroquinone forrns leading to the formation 
of DNA alkylating agents (Workrnan, 1994; Venviej et al., 1994). These dmgs rnay be 
used to target tumor cells that are rich in DTD. Elevated DTD activity has been observed 
in a nurnber of tumor ce11 lines (Robertson et al., 1992). Turnor biopsy materiai fiom 
patient 
lung, 
colon, and breast have also ken shown to contain elevated DTD activities 
compared to 
surrounding 
normal tissue 
(Koudstaal et al., 1975; Schlager and Powis, 
1990). 
The actual role of DTD in controlling ce11 sensitivity to quinone-containing dmgs 
is, however, 
controversial 
since one electron reductases may also play important roles, 
especially in hypoxic cells (Rockwell et ol., 1993; Rauh et al., 1993). The recent work of Fitzsimmons et al (1996) showing a correlation between DTD enzymatic activity and 
aerobic sensitivity to MMC and E09 in the NCI human tumor ce11 line panel is currentiy 
the best evidence for this role. The one electron 
reductases 
NADPH:cytochrome P-450 
reductase and NADH:cytochrome b, reductase failed to display such a correlation in this 
study. The alternative 
roie 
for DTD as a detoxifjring agent, by one step two-electron 
reduction of dietary and environmental quinones to redox active products remains a 
potentially important 
function 
for the enzyme (Powis, 1987). 
Cells that are homozygous for a C to T nucleotide transition at position 609 of the 
DTD cDNA were found to contain low to undetectable DTD enzymatic activities (Traver 
et al., 1992). It is estimated that approximately 40% of individuals are heterozygous for 
this nucleotide transition 
while 10% are homozygous (Kuehl et al., 1995). Limited data 
have shown that 
this 
point mutation is widespread (Rosvold et al., 1995; Rothman et al., 
1996). occurs in both normal tissues and tumors of the same individuai (Eickelmann et 
al., 1994; Traver et al., 1997) and may occur with altered fiequencies in different ethnic 
groups (Rothman et al., 1996). 
Traver et al (1997) have reported that a recombinant serine 187 mutant DTD 
expressed in E. coli. exhibits only 2% of the specific enzymatic activity of wild type 
protein. Wu et al (1 997) have similarly expressed the mutant isoform in E.coli and have 
shown that relative to wild-type protein it has 34% specific activity with DCPIP as 
substrate. In addition to measuring catalytic properties they found that the dissociation 
constant for FAD of the mutant isoform was twenty times the wild-type enzyme and 
suggested the point mutation changes enzyme conformation. The identification of human cells that are homoygous for the DTD nucleotide 
609T point mutation and do not express detectable DTD proteh (Marshall et al., 1991; 
Kuehl et al., 1995; Traver et al., 1997) raised the possibility that this mutation results in 
destabilization of the 
protein 
product. 
The 
results 
in Figure 2.4 indicate that there is a 3- 
fold reduction of mutant relative to wild-type protein in transfected COS4 cells. This 
value 
depends 
on the 
assumption 
that the mixture of monoclonal antibodies (B771 and 
A 180), used for Western blot analysis, binds with equal affinity to both the wild-type and 
mutant proteins. However, since one of the two antibodies binds to an epitope near the 
beginning 
of the 
region 
encoding by 
exon 6 of the DTD gene (Dr. David Ross, University 
of Colorado 
Health 
Sciences Center, 
personal 
communication), it is possible that the 
mutant isoform may not be as readily detected since the proline to serine change occurs in 
exon 6. 
Decreased mutant DTD protein stability has also ken reported by Pan et al 
(1 995) in studies of an arginine to tryptophan 139 substituted isoform in the HCT 1 16- 
R30A human colon cancer ce11 subline, which is resistant to MMC and homozygous for 
the point mutation encoding this isoform. This mutant DTD protein was detected by 
Western blot 
anaiysis 
in HCT 116-R30A cells but at 5% of the levels present in the 
parental MMC sensitive line. This mutant isoform was also expressed at detectable levels 
in 
E.coli and COS-7 cells (Hu er al., 1996). Therefore, stable expression of this DTD 
isoform may be ce11 type-specific. However, as the tryptophan 139 mutant has enzymatic 
activity comparable to the 
wild-type 
enzyme, the reduced 
activity 
displayed by HCT 1 16- 
R30A cells has been attributed to the low levels of mutant DTD protein. The present 
work suggests that the senne 187 mutation results in a reduction in both enzymatic activity and protein stability. Therefore, cells which express the senne 187 mutant would 
be predicted to be resistant to cinigs targeted for DTD activation. 
The proline to senne substitution at amino acid 187 in DTD may predispose 
individuals 
to cancer by removing an enzymatic defense mechanism againa 
carcinogenesis. However, the importance of DTD in cancer prevention is not clear, and 
factors 
such as the interplay of DTD with other enzymes acting on comrnon substrates 
need to be investigated Mer. The results of this study are consistent with the mode1 for 
a causal link between the C to T mutation at nucleotide 609 and predisposition to cancer 
based on ineffective xenobiotic detoxification. This mutation may also serve as a 
prognostic indicator for the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic dmgs activated by this 
enzyme. 2.6 References

DT-dia phorsse Point Mutation and Enzymatic Activity 3.1 Abstract 
DT-diaphorase (DTD), primarily a cytosolic reductase, has been implicated as an 
activator of chemotherapeutic prodrugs and a detoxifier of certain potentially 
carcinogenic xenobiotics. A common C to T nucleotide 609 substitution in DTD cDNA 
has been associated with protein instability and reduced catalytic activity. The degree to 
which the allelic status of the substitution correlates with enzymatic activity was assessed 
in 45 normal human skin fibroblast strains using a PCR-RFLP assay. Included in this 
study was the 3437T strain which is unique in that it is heterozygous for the base change 
yet contains undetectable enzymatic activity. An ailele-specific RT-PCR-RFLP technique 
attributed 
this phenornenon to exclusive DTD mRNA expression fiom the variant allele. 
Overlap in activities was observed between individual strains homozygous for the wild- 
type 
allele and heterozygotes but the former group displayed enzymatic activity that was 
on average 2-fold higher. Western Blot analysis of the two strains in this panel that are 
homozygous for the variant allele revealed that they express relatively low amounts of 
DTD protein, consistent with the role of the substitution in protein instability. mis work 
confirms 
that genotypic status is a reliable initial estimate of DTD activity. 3.2 Introduction 
DTD [NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO 1 ), Enzyme Commission 
No.1.6.99.21 
is a homodimenc 
flavoenyme 
that 
acts 
on a 
wide range of cytosolic 
substrates including 
quinones 
and their derivatives (Ernster, 1967; 
Talalay et al., 1995). 
DTD is present in many tissues but is most abundant in liver (Jaiswal, 1994) and can also 
be elevated in colon, liver. and breast tumors relative to surrounding normal tissue 
(Schlager 
and Powis, 1990). The obligate 
two-electron 
reductase 
activity of DTD is the 
basis for its 
postulated 
role as a defense mechanism against the carcinogenic effects of 
quinone 
xenobiotics, 
which 
are reduced to hydroquinone products by DTD, thereby 
bypassing the formation of semiquinones and subsequent reactive oxygen intermediates 
(Lind et al., 1982; Emster and Navazio, 1987). A DTD gene knockout mouse exhibits 
increased 
quinone 
sensitivity, consistent with its role as a protective mechanism against 
xenobiotic toxicity (Radjendirane et al., 1998). A broad variety of structuraily unrelated 
compounds have 
been 
shown 
to 
induce DTD expression (Prochaska and Talalay, 1988; 
Begleiter el al., 1997). 
Many chemotherapeutic agents can be reductively activated by DTD (Workman 
and Stratford, 1993; Knox et al., 1993; Sartorelli et al., 1994; Winski et al., 1998), but 
one concern with the use of 
these 
prodrugs 
clinically 
is 
the variability in DTD enzyme 
activities observed in different tissue types (Marin et al., 1997) and turnors (Siegel et al., 
1998). It has also ken suggested that the therapeutic index of drugs activated by DTD 
(Sreerama et al., 1995) can be increased through transcriptional activators (Yao et al., 
1997) such as 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones which can selectively induce DTD activity in turnor 
cells 
(Doherty et al., 1998). DTD and related nitroreductases are also king studied as prodmg activating enzymes in vinis-directed enzyme-prodnig therapies (Fnedlos et al-? 
1 998; Searle et al., 1998; Warrington et al., 1998). 
Traver et al (1992) identified a C to T base change at position 609 of the DTD 
cDNA which would confer a proline to serine substitution at amino acid 187 of the DTD 
protein. This base change has been associated with low or absent DTD activity (Traver et 
al.. 1 997; Kuehl et al., 1999, and transfection of eukaryotic cells with DTD expression 
vectors 
containing 
either a C or T nucleotide at position 609 demonstrated that the proline 
to serine substitution results in decreased catalytic activity and protein levels (Misra et 
al., 1998). Furthemore, mutant protein purified fiom an E.coli expression system 
exhibited 2% of the enzymatic activity of wild-type DTD (Traver et al., 1997). Allelic 
distribution 
of this common base change is in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibriurn with estimates of the fiequency of the 609T allele ranging fiom 0.16 to 0.49 
depending on ethnic background (Kelsey et al, 1997; Traver et al., 1997; Gaedigk et al., 
1998). 
Marshall et al. (1991) obsewed a relationship between DTD activity and 
mitomycin C sensitivity in a group of skin fibroblast strains donated by members of a 
cancer-prone 
farnily. 
However, in one heterozygotic 
ce11 
strain, 
3437T, DTD activity was 
undetectable (Kuehl et al., 1995), which conflicted with previous reports showing that the 
allelic status of the nucleotide 609 base change is a predictor for enzyme activity, with 
heterozygotes displaying activities intermediate to homozygous 609C (wild-type) and 
609T (mutant) ce11 strains (Traver et al., 1992). DTD mRNA was present in this ce11 
strain in 
similar 
quantities 
to cells exhibiting 
high DTD activities although the allelic 
origin 
of this rnRNA was not detennined. These results bring into question the reliability of predictions of DTD activity on the basis of the genomic status of the nucleotide 609 
base change. 
In the 
present 
report, a panel of normal human skin fibroblast ce11 strains was 
assessed for the allelic distribution of the nucleotide 609 base change and the relationship 
between allelic 
status and DTD activity. As well, the allelic ongin(s) of DTD mRNA 
expression was determined in 3437T cells, as well as seven selected strains fiom the skin 
fibroblast panel.

Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine semm (Cansera, Rexdale ON, Canada) and 
maintained 
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. 
3.3.3 Genomic PCR-Hinf 1 RFLP Assay 
Cells were grown in 175 cm' tissue culture flasks (Nalge Nunc International, 
Denmark), harvested by scraping and centrifuged at 250 x g. The pellet was resuspended 
in 1 mL lysis buffer [50 rnM KCI, 10 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8.3), 2.5 mM MgCl,, 0.5 (rg 
proteinase K, 0.1 mg/d gelatin, 0.45% Nonident P-40, and 0.45% Tween-201 and 
heated at 55 OC for 1 hour followed by 95 OC for 10 min. To assess the status of the 
nucleotide 609 base change (Figure 3. l), pnmers were used to amplify the entire coding 
region of exon 6 producing a 405 bp product containing the nucleotide 609 base change 
as well as a native Hinf 1 site as described previously (Goldberg et al., 1998). Briefly, 5

3.3.5 mRNA Profile Assessrnent of the Nucleotide 609 Base Change 
Total RNA was isolated fiom selected fibroblast strains using the RNeasy Mini 
Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc. Santa Clarita, CA). 5 pg of total RNA was reverse transcribed 
using the Superscript II Preamplification Kit (Gibco) and a DTD gene-specific primer, 5' TCC CAA CTG ACA ACC AGA TC 3' (nt 841-860 of DTD cDNA), according to the 
protocol of the manufacturer. 10% of the RT reaction was PCR amplified in a mixture (50 
PL total volume) containing reaction buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 rnM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 
and 0.001% (wlv) gelatin), 1.25 mM MgCl,, 0.2 mM dNTP mix and 5 U AmpliTaq 
Polymerase with 100 ng each of DTD gene-specific forward and reverse primer: 
5' GCC ATT CTG AAA GGC TGG TT 3' - forward primer (nt 38 1-400 DTD cDNA) 
5' CCA TCA CTT GGG CAA GTC CA 3' - reverse primer (nt 82 1-840 DTD cDNA). 
The 460 bp fiagment was amplified (Figure 3.2) using a 'Touchdown' PCR protocol 
(Don et al., 1991) consisting of a 3 min denaturation at 94 OC, 2 cycles of 1 min 
denaturation at 94 OC, 1 min annealing at 60 OC, and a 2 min polymerization at 72 "C, 12 
cycles in which the annealing temperature was decreased by 1 OC until a touchdown 
temperature of 48 OC was reached, an additional 17 cycles with the 48 OC annealing 
temperature, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 OC. The PCR product was digested 
with H~nfl, hctionated on o 1.2% agarose gel, and visualized by ethidium bromide (10 
pg/mL) staining. The wild-type (609C) DTD allele generates a 377 bp fina fragment, 
whereas the variant allele (609T) produces two Hinfi fragments of 226 and 15 1 bp. A 
constitutive 83 bp Hinfl fiagment is produced in addition to the ones derived fiom the 
wild-type and variant alleles but not observed under these gel electrophoresis conditions

fragment was used as a positive cutting control. 3.3.6 Western Blot Analysis 
DTD protein expression was verified in selected ceIl strains. Fibroblast strains 
were grown to a density of 5 x IO6 cells in 175 cm2 tissue culture flasks, harvested by 
scraping. pelleted at 250 x g for 5 min, and resuspended in 200 pL lysis buffer (0.1 M 
Tris-HCI. 1% SDS, 10 rnM EDTA, 20 mM dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitor 
cocktail. 
Cell 
extracts 
were placed in a boiling water bath for 2 min then centrifbged at 
14000 x g in an Eppendorf (Westbury, NY, USA) 54 1 SC centrifuge for 10 minutes at 
room temperature. The supernatant was recovered and protein concentration determined 
using the Bradford method (1976). A volume of cell extract containing 20 vg protein was 
mixed with 6X sample buffer (36% (v/v) glycerol, 5% P-mercaptoethanol, 10.3% (wh) 
SDS, 350 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 6.8), and 0.0 12% (w/v) bromphenol blue) heated to 100 OC 
for 2 min and fiactionated on a 14% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gel (Novex, San Diego 
CA) with 4% stacking gel at 2 mA/cm for 3 hours. Protein was electrotransferred to a 0.2 
pm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using a Mini Trans- 
Blot ce11 (Bio-Rad) at 6 mAkm in high ionic strength transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-HC1 
(pH 8.0) and 144 mM glycine) for 10-12 hours. Membranes were Ponceau S (Sigma 
Chemical Co.) stained (Klein et ai 1995) to confirm transfer efficiency and blocked with 
Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCI) containing 5% 
skim milk powder for 2h at RT. Blots were then incubated ovemight at 4°C with a 
mixture of mouse anti-human DTD monoclonal antibodies B771 and A180 or with a 
1600 dilution of moue anti-tubulin in TBS containing 1% skim milk powder (antibody 
binding solution). Membranes were 
washed 
three 
times with TBS and incubated with a 1 :4000 dilution of goat anti-mouse horse radish peroxidaseconjugated antibody (Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, CA) in antibody binding solution, washed as before, and treated 
with C hemilurninescence reagent (NEN, Boston, MA). Bands were visualized by 
exposure to NEN autoradiography film for 5 to 30s and quantified by densitometry within 
the linear range using a Molecular Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) Computing 
Densitometer with ImageQunt version 3.3 software.

3.4.1 The 609T Nucleotide Substitution Correlates with Reduced DTD 
Activity in a Panel of 45 Normal Human Fibroblast Cell Strains 
The C to T base change in nucleotide 609 of DTD cDNA, predicted to confer a 
proline to serine substitution in amino acid 187 of DTD protein, has been shown to 
impair catalytic activity and may result in protein instability (Misra et al., 1998, Chapter 
2; Traver et al., 1997). The 609T nucleotide substitution produces a novel Hi 1 
restriction site (RFLP) in the codon for amino acid 187, which can be used to screen 
genomic 
material 
(Figure 3.1 ) for this variant allele (Eickelmann et al., 1994; Goldberg et 
al., 1998). RFLP analysis of 45 human skin fibroblast ce11 strains, whose charactenstics 
are shown in Table 3.1 and Appendix 3.1, resulted in the following allelic distribution of 
the nucleotide 609 base change: 60% wild-type for both alleles (CIC fibroblasts); 35.5% 
heterozygous (Cm fibroblasts); and 4.5% homozygous for the variant ailele (T/T 
fibroblasts). Thirty-one of the strains were assessed independently 2-3 times with 
complete consistency of results. Number of Strains 45

in Figure 3.3. Each assay for enzymatic activity was run using three different 
concentrations of 
ce11 
lysate 
and the resulting data was averaged to give a value which is 
ploned in the Figure. Repeat independent measurements with five of the ceIl strains 
which were 
C/C 
and three which were Cm in genotype gave means with standard enors 
which were approximately plus or minus twenty percent of the mean (n = 3 - 4). C/C and 
C/T fibroblasts displayed a wide range of DTD activities but overall the group 
homozygous for the wild-type (609C) DTD allele had significantly greater enzymatic 
activities than heterozygous (609C/609T) ce11 strains (Mann-Whitney Rank Order 
Analysis, a < 0.01 for a two-sided test) with the former showing 2-fold greater mean 
DTD activities (754 f s.e.m. 78 nrnol/min/mg protein) than the latter (324 f s.e.m. 30 
nmol/min/mg protein). In two fibroblasts strains that were homozygous for the variant 
allele, DTD activity was extremely low to undetectable. These results are consistent with 
the notion that the 609T substitution impairs the catalytic activity and/or stability of 
DTD, and that a correlation exists between 609T allelic status and DTD activity in the 
individual 
ce11 
strains 
studied. 
3.4.2 DTD mRNA Profile of 3437T Fibroblasts 
The 34371' ce11 strain is unusual in that it is heterozygous for the DTD nucleotide 
609 base change but contains undetectable enzymatic activity (Marshall et al., 1 99 1 ; 
Kuehl et al., 1995). Genotypic status and lack of enzyme activity was confirmed in this 
ce11 
strain in the present work (data not shown). These previous studies have show that I

group of 45 normal human skin fibroblast strains. There was some overlap of data points.

heterozygote group are indicated. total DTD mRNA levels in 3437T cells are similar to other cell strains displaying

Because

allele 
display 
very 
low to 
undetectable 
DTD 
activity, one possible 
explanation 
for the low DTD activity in 3437T 
cells is that they express the variant 609T allele exclusively. To examine this question, 
the relative levels of expression of the two alleles in 3437T cells were compared to seven 
selected 
fibroblast strains fiom Table 3.1 that are homozygous for the wild-type allele (3 
strains). heterozygous (2 
strains) 
or homozygous (2 
strains) 
for the variant allele (Table 
3 -2). Total RNA isolated fiom each ce11 strain was PCR-arnplified (Figure 3.2). As shown 
in Figure 3.4, the DTD mRNA expression profile in the group of fibroblasts fkom Table 
3.2 was in agreement with the genomic status of the nucleotide 609 base change (with 
heterozygotes expressing DTD mRNA fiom both alleles). However, 3437T ceils 
displayed an RFLP pattern consistent with fibroblast strains that are homozygous for the 
variant (609T) allele, indicating that DTD mRNA expressed in 3437T cells arises 
exclusively 
fiorn 
the variant 
(609T) 
allele. 
Because 
expression of the 609T variant 
allele has been associated with reduced 
DTD protein levels (perhaps due to a decrease in protein stability), we also examined 
DTD 
protein 
levels in 3437T cells relative to this sarne panel of seven fibroblast ce11 
strains from Table 3.2. As show in Figure 3.5, DTD protein levels in 3437T cells were 
reduced relative to homozygous wild-type and heterozygous ce11 strains to levels that 
were similar to that in the two fibroblast strains homozygous for the variant allele. This is 
consistent with the RT-PCR analysis pointing to exclusive expression of the variant 609T Table 3.2: Allelic status and DTD activities of 7 skin fibroblast strains taken fiom panel

3.5 Discussion 
The probability that cells will fail to activate bioreductive prodrugs or inactivate 
xenobiotics that are substrates for DTD due to expression of the 609T variant isoform has 
been estimated by measuring the prevalence of the 609T allele in various populations. 
The fiequency of the base change varies between ethnic groups; with 2.5 - 25% of 
individuais 
homozygous for the variant 609T allele (Kelsey et al., 1997, see Table 5.1). 
The variant allele has also been examined in different tumor ce11 types, with reduced 
frequencies 
compared to 
disease 
free reference groups observed in lung (Chen er al., 
1999), and increased fiequencies in certain infant leukemias (Wiemels et al., 1999). 
However, studies showing no significant differences in variant allele fiequencies in 
tumors 
have also been 
reported 
(Traver et al., 1997). A benzene exposed population 
stratified 
into 
hematological 
malignancy 
and case 
control 
groups displayed a higher 
occurrence of the variant 
allele 
in the former group 
(Rothman el al., 1996), consistent 
with the possibility that expression of the variant allele can impair the defense mechanism 
of the ce11 against carcinogenesis mediated by certain xenobiotics (Vasiliou et al., 1995). 
Estimating the magnitude of the response of individuais or ce11 populations to 
xenobiotics or prodrugs that are DTD substrates on the basis of the allelic status of the 
nucleotide 609 base change will depend on the extent to which allelic status reflects 
enzyme activity. The variant 609T allele has been implicated as a marker for some 
diseases 
associated with insufficient detoxification of xenobiotics by DTD, and occurs at a higher fkequency in some tumors. However, the absence of significant levels (Marshall 
et al.. 1991; Kuehl et al., 1995) of DTD activity in at least one human ce11 swn 
heterozygous for the variant allele, 3437T, brought into question the relationsh@ between 
genotype and phenotype. In this study we have re-examined the prevalence of the DTD 
nucleotide 609T substitution in the normal population using 45 normal fibroblast 
strains denved fiom skin biopsies (Table 3.1), and have used this information to 
investigate the correlation between genotypic status and DTD activity. 
The variant 609T allele occurred with a fiequency of 0.21 in our panel of 45 
normal human skin fibroblast ce11 strains, with a distribution that is in accordance with 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and is consistent with previous reports (Kelsey et al., 1997, 
Rosvold et al.! 1995, and Schulz et al., 1997). However, the aforementioned variation in 
frequency based on ethnicity may be relevant as a risk factor for disease associated with 
environmental and dietary exposures as hypothesized for other drug metaboliring 
enzymes that display genetic polymorphisms (Nebert er al., 1999). The ethnicity of al1 the 
donors 
in the present skin fibroblast panel was not revealed. Limited information 
indicated they represented a 
mixture 
of 
ethnic 
backgrounds (see Appendix 3.1 ). 
Fibroblasts homozygous for the wild-type (609C) allele displayed on average 2- 
fold greater DTD activities as compared to heterozygous fibroblast strains in this panel. 
This observation is consistent with a gene dosage effect arising fkom expression of the 
single wild-type 609C 
allele in heterozygous strains. The two homozy gous 609T 
fibroblast strains contained very low to undetectable enzyme activities in agreement with 
dl reports of other groups for the effect of this genotype. However, considerable overlap 
in enzyme activity was observed between the individuai homozygous wild-type 609C and heterozygous fibroblast ce11 strains. A likely explanation for the broad range of enyme 
activities 
within 
these 
two 
groups is a variation in the levels of DTD mRNA expressed in 
each 
ce11 
strain. 
Traver 
et al (1 992) observed a strong correlation between DTD mRNA 
levels and enzyme activity in a colon cancer ce11 panel using a semi-quantitative RT-PCR 
technique. Siegel et al. (1999) also showed that DTD protein levels in human saliva were 
directly correlated mith the DTD nucleotide 609 genotype with C/C individuais showing 
twice the protein level as C/T individuals and Tm individuals having undetectable levels. 
A similar overlap between C/C individuals and C/T individuals was seen in this work. 
The 3437T ce11 strain is unique among ce11 strains in the present work and in 
previous studies in that 
it 
is genetically heterozygous but displays 
very 
low to 
undetectable DTD activity. Western blot analysis indicates that these cells express DTD 
at lower levels than cells homozygous or heterozygous for the wild-type allele, perhaps 
due to instability of the variant isoform. The level of expression of DTD protein is similar 
in 
3437T 
cells and the two homozygous mutant allele ce11 strains (Figure 3.5, lanes 5,7, 
and 8). The levels of protein in homozygous wild-type ailele ceIl strains are greater than 
those in the heterozygotes (ANOVA, p < 0.01). RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the 
variant allele is expressed exclusively in 3437T cells. Therefore, although 3437T cells 
represent an extreme case, they illustrate a potential problem in the use of allelic status of 
the nucleotide 609 base change to predict DTD activity in heterozygotes. The overlap in 
enzymatic 
activities observed between homo ygous wild-type 609C and heterozygous 
fibroblasts 
also illustrates the 
dificulty 
in distinguishing C/C fiom C/T cells on the basis 
of enzyme activity, although such cet1 strains are clearly distinguishable fiom T/T ce11 
strains. The absence of measurable DTD mRNA expression fiom the C allele in 3437T 
cells may be due to methylation leading to matemal or paternal gene silencing (Rarin, 
1998) or to defects in the upstream promoter region affecting basal transcription. 
Similarly, the variation in DTD activities observed within groups of C/C and C/T celis 
may reflect individual differences in transcriptional responses given the complexity of 
pathways involving the xenobiotic response element and the antioxidant response 
element (Jaiswal, 1991 ; Favreau and Pickett, 1991) and their corresponding cis- and 
trans- 
acting factors. 
In conclusion, prediction of cellular responses to 
prodrugs and xenobiotics that 
depend on DTD activity cm be based to a first approximation on genotype status, which 
can distinguish between significant levels of enzyme activity in homozygous wild-type 
and heterozygous cells and very low to undetectable levels of enzyme activity in 
homozygous variant cells. Although heterozygotes have on average half the activity of 
wild-type cells, the ranges are overlapping. The existence of a heterozygous ce11 strain 
with no detectable DTD activity, due to allele specific expression, was a unique 
occurrence in the present work and is 
unlikely 
to play a large role in predictions based on 
geno typing. 3.6 References

Diaphorase Via AD5 Delivery 4.1 Abstract 
Mitomycin C (MMC), a prototypical bioreductive prodnig, can be activated by 
DT-diaphorase (DTD) hto a DNA alky lating agent. Intra-tumoral injection of 
recombinant 
adenoviral type 5 vectoa (Ad5) that carry prodmg-activating enzymes like 
DTD could be used to selectively target tumor cells for chemotherapy. To demonstrate 
the feasibility of this approach, Ad5 vectors were constmcted that express D?D 
minigenes for both wild-type and mutant (C to T change in nucleotide 609 in DTD 
cDNA) DTD under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. HT29 human 
colon carcinoma cells express wild-type DTD, whereas BE human colon carcinoma cells 
have low to undetectable DTD activity due to the nucleotide 609C to T mutation and are 
6-fold more resistant to MMC than HT29 cells. A test of the ability of Ad5 to infect these 
cells using a B-gaiactosidase CMY driven minigene indicated that BE cells were 90- 
100% infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 while HT29 cells are only 15- 
40% infected at this MOI. Infection of BE cells in vitro with recombinant Ad5 carrying a 
minigene for wild-type DTD resulted in high levels of expression of exogenous DTD and 
increased MMC sensitivity. Infection of HT29 cells with recombinant Ad5 expressing a 
non-functional DTD mutant produced little change in endogenous DTD activity, and 
tfiere was no evidence of a dominant negative effect. Infection of BE cells at MOIS of 3 to 
100 resulted in a progressive increase in DTD activity and enhanced sensitization to 
MMC. BE cells infected at an MOI of 100 and expressing wild-type DTD were 8-fold 
more sensitive to MMC as rneasured by a colony forming assay. HTî9 cells were 
sensitized 2-3 fo1d following treatment with AdS.DTD at a MOI of 100. These results indicate that adenovinis-mediated gene transfer and expression of wild-type DTD can 
sensitize 
tumors 
cells 
to MMC and that in vivo testing of this approach is warranted. 
3.2 Introduction 
DT-diaphorase [NAD(P)H (reduced nicotinarnide adenine dinucleotide, with or 
without 
phosphate):quinone 
oxidoreductase (NQO,), Enzyme Commission No. 1 -6-99.21 
is a homodimenc, cytosolic flavoenzyme that acts on its substrates by a concened two 
electron reduction process (Emster, 1967). This enzyme acts on a wide variety of 
substrates (Talalay et al., 1999, but most attention has been given to naturally occurring 
(Keyes et al., 1984) and synthetic quinone-based compounds (Phillips et al., 1999). DTD 
acts as a quinone reductase capable of detoxifying a variety of xenobiotics including 
quinones, 
azo-dyes, and 
nitro-compounds 
(Emster. 1987; 
Talalay, 
1989). MMC (Figure 
I -3) is a naturally occurring quinone that is considered to be a prototypical bioreductive 
agent (Sartorelli et al., 1994). Metabolic reduction of MMC by DTD converts this 
prodmg into a cytotoxic DNA alkylating agent (Figure 1.3). Reaction with nucleophilic 
DNA bases, preferentially by guanine and cytosine (Iyer and Szybalski, 1964) towards 
two electrophilic centers (carbons 1 and 10) results in intra- or interstrand crosslinking, 
the latter of which is believed to result in cytotoxicity (Workman and Stratford, 1993). 
A definitive physiological role for DTD has not yet been established. The liver 
contains the most abundant levels of DTD (Jaiswal, 1994) but other tissues, including 
heart, lung, and kidney also exhibit varying DTD activities (Maritus, 1963). Elevated 
DTD activities have been reported in tumor relative to normal tissue (Marin et al., 1997) 
and in tumor ce11 lines (Kepa and Ross, 1999). It has been suggested that this difference be exploited towards enzyme-prodrug therapy using compounds that are DTD substrates 
(Workman, 
1994). However, a high degree of heterogeneity in DTD enzymatic activities 
(Traver et al., 1992) and protein levels (Belcourt et al., 1998) have been observed both 
within and across normal and tunor tissue types. This is due to a nurnber of factors 
including the 
inducibility of the enzyme (Begleiter et al., 1997) and to a high fiequency C 
to T base change at nucleotide 609 of the DTD mRNA resulting in heterozygotes with 
approximately hdf the DTD activity as compared to wild-type cells (Chapter 3). This 
base transition 
results 
in a proline to serine change in arnino acid 1 87, impaired DTD 
catalytic activity, and protein instability (Traver et al., 1992; Siegel et al., 2000). 
To circumvent the problem of heterogeneity in DTD activity in tumor cells, a first 
generation Ad5 vector was created that expresses wild-type human DTD under the 
control of the CMV promoter. Ad5 vectors have been previously used with good success 
to deliver minigenes encoding prodrug activating enzymes to tumor cells (Bndgewater et 
al.? 1995). The results demonstrate that adenovims-mediated gene transfer and expression 
of DTD can sensitize human colon carcinoma cells, homozygous for either wild-type or 
variant 
alleles 
(Traver et al., 1992) of the DTD gene, to MMC. 
4.3 Materials and Methods 
4.3.1 Chernicals and Reagents 
Al1 reagents used for the DTD enzymatic assay were purchased fiom Sigma 
Chernical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Materials used for PCR, including AmpliTaq 
polymerase were 
obtained 
fiom 
Roche 
Molecular 
Systems Inc. (Branchburg, NJ, USA). 
DTD monocIonal antibodies B771 and A1 80 were supplied by Dr. David Ross (University of Colorado Healîh Sciences Center, Denver CO, USA). Ant i-human integrin 
a, (MAB 1960) was purchased from Chernicon (Temecula, CA, USA). MMC (catalog no. 
M4287) was obtained fiom Sigma. X-gal, potassium femcyanide, and potassium 
ferrocyanide, 
used for 
histochemical 
detection of D-galactosidase, were also purchased 
from Sigma. 
4.3.2 Ceil Culture 
293T human embryonic kidney cells were obtained fiom Microbix Biosystems 
(Toronto, ON, Canada) for the production of 
El-defective 
recombinant Ad5 (Chapter 
1.4.4). Hela hurnan cervical carcinoma cells, used to test for wild-type recombinant virus, 
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA. BE and 
HT29 hwnan colon carcinoma cells were chosen for this work because of previous work 
that showed that their 6-fold difference in MMC sensitivity was due to low or absent 
DTD activation in BE cells (Traver et al., 1992) and that both cells can be infected by 
Ad5 (Dr. Henry Klamut, University of Toronto, personal communication). BE and HT29 
hurnan cells were obtained fiom Dr. T. Mulcahy, Wisconsin Clinical Cancer Centre. 
Madison, WI, USA. Al1 ce11 lines were maintained as monolayer cultures in growth 
medium consisting of a-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10Y0 fetal bovine 
serum (Gansera, Rexdale ON, Canada) and maintained in a hurnidified atmosphere 
containing 5% CO, at 37OC in 175 cm2 polystyrene tissue culture flasks (Nunc, Life 
Technologies, 
Burlington, 
ON, Canada). 4.3.3 Preparation of the Ad5 CM-Bascd Shuttk Vector 
An Ad5 shuttle vector containing the CMV promoter and a bovine growth 
hormone (BGH) poly A signal was constructed by Dr. HJ Klamut, Ontario Cancer 
Institute. as shown in Figure 4.1. A 953 bp Sal 1 -%a 1 fragment (fragment 1) containing 
the CMV promoter and the entire polylinker except for the Apa I site of the pRc/CMV 
(Invitrogen Co., San Diego, CA, USA) mammaiian expression vector and a 299 bp Xba I 
- Barn HI fragment (fragment 2) containing the BGH poly A region of pRc/CMV, were 
inserted into the corresponding restriction sites in the polylinker of pAE 1 sp 1 B (Microbix 
Biosystems) 
to generate pAE 1 sp 1 BCMV. pAEl sp 1 BCMV is a modified Ad5 shuttie

AdS.DTD vectors were produced according to a modification of a method 
developed by 
McGrory et al. (1988, Figure 1.6). 2 x 10' 293T cells were seeded in each 
well of a 6 well tissue culture dish (Nunc) in 5 mL of growth medium and incubated 
ovemight in a hurnidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 OC to reach a confluency 
of approximately 70%. Cells were cotransfected using a CaPO, CO-precipitation method 
(Graham and Van der Eb, 1973) using 5 pg of AdS.DTD shuttle vector 
(pAE 1 spl B-DTD- or pAE 1 sp 1 B.DTDmT) and 15 pg of pJM 1 7 (Microbix Biosystems, 
Figure 1.6). Transfection medium was removed by aspiration after 24 hours followed by 
a gentle wash with growth medium. Agarose overlay solution was prepared by melting a 
1.2 % stock solution of SeaPlaqueTM agarose (Mandel Scientific Co., Guelph, ON, 
Canada) in water using a microwave to mise the solution to its boiling point, cooling to 
50 OC in an isothermic water bath, and mixing with an equal volume of room temperature 
2X a-minimal essential medium without phenol red and supplemented with 20% fetal 
bovine 
sem. 3 mL of agarose overlay solution was added dropwise to each well and 
placed 
undisturbed 
at 
room 
temperature 
for 20 minutes foliowed by incubation in a 
humidified atmosphere 
containing 5% CO2 at 37 OC. After 5 and 10 days, a Mer 2 mL 
of agarose overlay solution was added to each well as before to refeed the cells. 3-4 days 
later, 
pIaque 
formation was observed. 
Plaques were isolated by aspiration using a Gilson 1000 pL Pipetman (Mandel 
Scientific Co.) with a 1 mL tip, transferred to 2 mL microtubes (DiaMed Lab Supplies 
Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) and diluted with 1 mL of PBS. The agarose was mixed into solution by gentle resuspension with a 1000 PL Pipemian and the mixture was 
centnfuged at 14000 x g in an Eppendorf (Westbury, NY, USA) 5415C cenhfuge for 5 
minutes at 4 OC . The pellet was diswded and the supematant was subjected to 1-2 
rounds of fieeze thaw (1 minute in a dry ice / ethanol bath followed by 1 minute in a 37 
OC water bath to disrupt host cells). 0.2 mi, of the supernatant was added to 24 well 
dishes (Nunc) that were seeded with 2 x IO4 293T cells the night before. Afier 30 minutes 
to ailow viral absorption to monolayer, each well was topped off with 1.8 rnL of growth 
medium. 
Afier 2-3 days, cytopathic effect (CPE) mediated by virus was observed. At this 
point, dishes were placed at room temperature for 10-1 5 minutes to promote host ce11 
detachment. Cells were harvested by gentle scraping and resuspension with a 5 mL 
plastic pipette (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA, USA), transferred to 2 mL polypropylene 
cryogenic 
vials 
(Costar), 
and 
centrifuged 
at 14000 x g for 5 minutes at 4 OC. 1 mL of 
supematant was used to infect a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask (Nunc) that was seeded with 4 
x IO' 293T cells and containing 5 mL of growth medium the night before. 
After 2-3 days, viral CPE was observed and cells were harvested as before, 
transferred to 15 mL polypropylene tubes (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lanes, 
NJ, USA). and centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 minutes at 4 OC. 2 mL of supernatant was used 
to infect an 80 cm' tissue culture flask (Nunc) that was seeded the night before with 10' 
293T cells and containing 20 mL of growth medium. 
After 2 days, viral CPE was observed and cells were harvested as before, 
transferred to 50 mL polypropylene tubes (Becton Dickinson), and centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 minutes at 4 OC. 10 mL of supernatant was used to infect a 175 cm2 tissue culture 
flask that was seeded the night before with 4 x 10' 2931 cells and containing 30 mL of 
growth medium. 
After 2-3 days, upon viral mediated CPE, this procedure was repeated to infect 4 x 
175 cm' tissue culture flasks and scaled up once more to infect 12-16 flasks. Mer 2-3, 
days, when complete vual CPE was observed, flasks were placed at room temperature for 
20 minutes to promote host ce11 detatchment. Cells were gently scraped and pooled into 
500 mL centrifuge bottles (Nunc) and spun for 10 minutes at 4 OC in a Sorvall (Dupont, 
Wilmington, DE, USA) GS3 rotor at 6000 x g. Viral supematants were stored at 4 OC for 
up to one month for use in starter cultures. 
Ce11 
pellets were pooled and resuspended in 5 rnL of 10 rnM Tris-HCI (pH 8), 
subjected to 3 rounds of fieeze-thaw (2 minutes in a dry ice 1 ethanol bath followed by 2 
minutes in a 37 OC water bath), and 1.2 rnL of Tris buffer was added to top off volume to 
6.2 mL. 0.62 mL of 5% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma) was added and the mixture was 
incubated for 30 minutes on ice at which point 70 pL of 1M MgSO, (Sigma) was added 
(for a final concentration of 10 mM) as well as 20 PL (200 U) of DNase 1 (Life 
Technologies) and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes with intermittent gentle 
shaking. 
4 rnL of CsCl (Life Technologies) saturated water (-1.8 g 1 mL) was added and 
the mixture was transferred to a Beckman (Palo Alto, CA, USA) 16 x 76 mm Quick-Seal 
tube, topped with a solution containing 10 rnM Tris-HC1 (pH 8), 5% sodium 
deoxycholate, and CsCl saturated water (approximately 65 g 1 100 mL), and centrifuged in a Ti-50 rotor (Beckman) at 43,000 x g for 18 hours at 15 OC. The viral band, located 
0.5 - 1 cm above the ce11 pellet, was removed by an 18 gauge needle puncture, transferred 
to dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut-off of 12,000 - 14,000 Da (Spectxum 
Laboratory Products, Houston. TX' USA) and dialyzed against 2L of 10 mM Tris-HCI 
(pH 8) for 24 hours at 4 OC to dilute the CsCI, with transfer to fiesh dialysis solution at 
the 3rd and 6th hours. Viral stocks were aliquoted into 200 pL volumes and stored at -70 
OC. Total viral stock volume was between 1 -5 to 2 mL. 
4.3.6 Determination of AdS.DTD Viral Titres 
Ad5.DTD viral particle concentration was determined by 0D2, measurement (1 
OD,, = 50 pg 1 mL double-stranded DNA, Sambrook et al., 1989) of samples of viral 
solution (dialyzed viral solution) and viral particle concentration was calculated with the 
assumption of a genomic molecular weight of 2.4 x IO7 g / mol. Ad5.DTD viral titres 
were determined to be: 
5.4 x 109 particles 1 pL - A~S.DTD- 
4.4 x 109 particles 1 PL - A~s.DTD~~~ 
Ad5.DTD 
infectious titres were determined by measurement of 
plaque-forming 
units (PFU) per unit volume (Graham and Prevec, 1991). For each vira1 solution (pst- 
dialysis solution) two 6-well dishes were plated with 3 x 10' 293T cells containing 
growth 
medium the night before. 10-fold senal virai dilutions were prepared by diluting 
25 pL of viral stock with 225 pL of senun-fiee a-minimal essential medium to an end 
point of 10''~ fold dilution. Growth medium was gently asphted fiom each well and replaced with 200 pL of serum-fiee a-minimal essential medium followed by 100 pL of 
each dilution. Dishes were incubated for 1 hour in a humidified atmosphere containing 
5% CO2 at 37 OC at which point 3 rnL of agarose overlay solution was applied to each 
well as described in section 4.3.5. Plaque formation was assessed 5-8 days later and 
number 
of plaques / 100 PL / dilution factor was averaged and converted to PFU / pL for 
an estimate of viral stock concentration. The AdS-DTD infectious titres were determined 
to be: 
1 o8 PFU ! pL - A~~.DTD- 
108 PFU / pL - A~S.DTD~~ 
Thus, 1 /5O viral particles were infectious. 
4.3.7 Assay for Wild-Type Ad5 Contamination 
To check for wild-type Ad5 variants arising through recombination with the El 
region of 293T cells, 2 x 10' Hela cells, which do not contain Ad5 El sequences and 
therefore can only support replication of wild-type virus, were seeded in 6 well dishes 
with 5 mL of growth medium and incubated ovemight in a humidified atmosphere 
containing 5% CO, at 37 OC. Medium was gently aspirated and replaced with 5 mL of 
growth medium containing 10' viral particles of A~S.DTD- or A~s.DTD~'~~. 
Monoiayers were monitored for up to 10 days for potential CPE. 
4.3.8 PCR Diagnostic for AdS.DTD 
Viral DNA for PCR was prepared by mixing 10" viral particles with 10 rnM Tris- HCI to a final volume of 50 PL. An equal volume of phenol:chlorofom:isoamyl alcohol 
(25:24:1) was added. mixed vigorously for 30 seconds using a Genie 2 Vortex (Fisher 
Scientific, 
Nepean, ON, Canada), and spun at 14000 x g for 30 seconds at room 
temperature. 
The pellet containing 
protein was discarded and the top (aqueous) phase 
containing Ad5 DNA was added to an equal volume of ch1oroform:isoamyl alcohol 
(24: 1) and mixed and separated by centrifugation as before. The top phase was retained 
and this step was repeated once more to remove as much phenol as possible. The aqueous 
phase (- 300 PL) containing Ad5 DNA was mixed with 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium 
acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of ethanol, vortexed and DNA was precipitated for 3h at 
-20 OC. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 14000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 OC. The 
supernatant was gently aspirated leaving a small volume (20 - 50 PL) behind to prevent 
disturbance 
of the pellet. The pellet was washed by resuspension in 0.5 rnL of 80% 
ethanol. centrifugation at 14000 x g for 1 O minutes at 4 OC. The supernatant was removed 
and a smali volume of solvent was left behind as before. The residual volume was 
removed by evaporation using a Savant AS290 SpeedVac Concentrator (Gibson Air Ltd., 
Toronto, ON, Canada) for 3 - 5 minutes in a chamber temperature of 45 OC. Pellets were 
soaked for 10 minutes in 50 PL of TE buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 
mM EDTA followed by gentle resuspension and washing of walls of tube to ensure 
recovery of as much DNA as possible. 
2 pL of DNA template extract in TE buffer (250 ng DNA / mL dilutions of 
pAE 1 sp 1 B .DTD-, pAE 1 sp 1 B.DTD~'~~, and pJM 17 used as positive molecular weight 
controls, 
or stock solutions of A~S.DTD- or A~s.DTD~~) or 2 PL of TE without DNA (negative contamination control) was PCR amplified in a mixture (50 pL total volume) 
containhg reaction buffer [50 mM KCI, 10 rnM Tris-HCl @H 8.3)' and 0.001% (w/v) 
gelatin)], 1.25 rnM MgC12, 0.2 mM dNTP mix and 5 U AmpliTaq Polymerase with 1 00

genome) 
The 461 (DTD cDNA amplification) and 291 (Ad5 genome amplification) bp fragments 
were 
amplified 
using a 'Touchdown' PCR protocol @on et al 1991) consisting of a 3 
min denaturation at 94 OC. 2 cycles of 1 min denaturation at 94 OC, 1 min annealing at 60 
OC, and a 2 min polymenzation at 72 OC, 12 cycles in which the annealing temperature 
was decreased by 1 OC until a touchdown temperature of 48 OC was reached, an additional 
20 cycles with the 48 OC annealing temperature, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 OC. 
The PCR products were fiactionated on a 1.2% agarose gel, and visualized by ethidium 
bromide (1 0 pg/mL) staining. 
4.3.9 Infection of BE and HT29 Cells with Ad5.O-Galactosidase 
IO5 BE and HT29 cells were seeded in each well of 6 well tissue culture dishes 
(Nunc) in 5 mi, of growth medium and incubated ovemight in a hurnidified atmosphere containhg 5% CO, at 37 OC. Growth medium was gently aspirated from each well and 
replaced with 0.5 of senim-fiee a-minimal essential medium with a recombinant Ad5 
vector carrying the 
E.coli 
O-galactosidase 
(B-gal) 
gene 
under 
the control of the CMV 
promoter (provided by Dr. Henry Klamut, University of Toronto) at a MOI (plaque 
forming units / cell) of 3, 10, 30, 60, or 100. AAer 30 minutes of incubation, 5 mL of 
growth medium was added to each well. Histochemical detection of Bgal positive cells 
was performed 48 hours later (Sanes et al., 1986). Infection eficiency of Ad5.O-gal was 
assessed by determining mean s.d. fraction O-gal positive cells in 5 random 4.3 mm2 
fieIds at 80X magnification. Positive cells were determined based on blue staining 
independent of variations in 
color 
intensity. 
4.3.10 Western Blot Analysis of HT29 and BE Cells or BE Cells Infected with 
AdS.DTD 
5 x 10' BE or HT29 cells were seeded in 10 cm diameter tissue culture dishes 
(Nunc) containing 10 mL of growth medium overnight in a humidified atmosphere 
containing 
5% CO, at 37°C. Medium was gently aspirated fiom BE cells and replaced 
with 1 mL of sem-fiee a-minimal essential medium containing a MOI of 10 or 100 of 
A~S.DTD~~' or A~S.DTD~~ and incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% 
CO, at 37OC for 30 minutes at which point 10 mL of growth medium was added to each 
dish. 48 h later, Ad5-DTD infected or uninfected BE and HT29 cells were harvested by 
scraping. Total ce11 protein extracts were prepared, protein concentrations determined, 
and Western Blot and densitometry analysis carried out as described in Chapter 3.3.6 with the exception that blots were probed for integrin a, expression (using a 1:1000 
dilution of anti-human integrin a,) as a loading control and protease inhibitors were not 
used. 
4.3.1 1 DTD Assay 
DTD enzyme activity was measured using the substrate 2,6- 
dichiorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) as previously described (Misra et al., 1 998, Chapter 
2.3 S). 
4.3.12 A~s.DTD- Infection of HT29 Ceils 
5 x 10' HT29 cells were seeded in six IO cm diameter tissue culture dishes 
containing 10 mL of growth medium overnight in a humidified atmosphere containing 
5% CO, at 37'C. Medium was gently aspirated fiom three of the dishes and replaced with 
serum-free a-minimal essential medium containing a MOI of 100 of A~S.DTD~~. Cells 
were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO, at 37OC for 30 minutes, 
afier which 10 mL of growth medium was added to each dish. The remaining three 
uninfected dishes were used as controls. 48 hours later, cells were harvested and DTD 
activities were deterrnined. 
4.3.13 DTD Enzyme Activity in AdS-DTD-infected BE Celfs 
5 x 10' BE cells were seeded in 10 cm diarneter tissue culture dishes containing 
10 mL of growth medium overnight in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. Medium was gently aspirated and replaced with 1 rnL of serum-fiee a-minimal 
essential medium 
containing a MOI of 10 or 100 of A~s-DTD-. Cells were incubated in 
a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO, at 37OC for 30 minutes, afler which 10 mL 
of growth medium was added to each dish. DTD enzyme activity was detennined 24,48, 
and 72 hours pst-infection. In one experiment, BE cells iïifected with A~S.DTD- at an 
MOI of 100 were trypsinized and half the cells were reseeded at the 48 hour time point 
and DTD activity was determined 48 hours later (96 hour time point). 
4.3.14 Clonogenic Survival of Cells Exposed to MMC 
IO5 BE or Hl29 cells were seeded in 10 cm diameter tissue culture dishes 
containing growth medium. 
After 
ovemight 
incubation in a 
humidified atmosphere 
containing 5% COz at 37 OC, medium was gently aspirated and replaced with 1 mL of 
sem-ffee 
a-rninimal 
essential medium containing the desired MOI of A~~.DTD- or 
A~S.DTD~~. For experiments examining the effect of viral titration on MMC sensitivity, 
dilutions were 
perfomed 
starting 
at 100 MOI / mL A~S-DTD- stock and carried out 
dotvn to 3 MOI / mi, A~s.DTD- in senun-fiee a-minimal essential medium. 1 mL was 
added to each dish. Dishes were incubated with virus for 1 hour in a hurnidified 
atmosphere containing 5% CO, at 37 OC, after which 9 mL of growth medium was added 
to each dish and mer incubated for 48 hours before MMC expusure. For MMC 
sensitivity determination of uninfected controls, cells were similarly plated ovemight 
prior to MMC exposure. MMC stocks were prepared by reconstitution with PBS at 1 mg I rnL and stored 
for up to 1 month at 4 OC in the dark. Stock concentrations were verified by measuring 
absorbance at 363 nrn (E = 21,840 cm-' M-'). In experiments requiring MMC treatrnent. 
medium (with or without virus) was replaced with IO mL of growth medium containing 
MMC at the desired concentrations and cells were incubated with drug for 1 hour in a 
humidified 
atmosphere 
containing 5% CO, at 37 OC. Mer MMC exposure, medium 
containing drug 
was 
decanted and residual 
dmg was removed by washing cells with 5 mL 
PBS and cells were harvested by trypsinization and pelleted by centrifugation at 250 x g 
for 5 minutes at 4 OC. Pellets were resuspended in 10 mL of growth medium and ce11 
density was assessed by 0.2% trypan blue (Life Technologies) exclusion using a 
hemocytometer. Ce11 dilutions were prepared at IO4, IO3, and 10~ells / rnL and 1 mL of 
each dilution was plated in 60 x 15 mm dishes (Nunc) in duplicate (for drug treated cells) 
or in triplicate (untreated controls) and incubated as before. Colonies were counted 12-14 
days 
later 
afier 
staining with 0.5 % methylene blue (Sigma) dissolved in equal parts 
ethanol to water. Plating efficiency was assessed by dividing the number of observed 
colonies by the total number of cells plated. The mean * s.e.m. (n = 5) plating esciencies 
of uninfected HT29 and BE control cells were 0.84 * 0.09 and 0.69 + 0.12, respectively. 
Fold sensitivities of BE cells infected at various MOIS of A~~.DTD- to MMC (Figure 
4.12) were determined by comparing the ratio of dose (pg/mL) required to achieve 1 log 
of ce11 kill relative to the initial plating efficiency to that of BE cells infected with 
~d5. DTD~'~~. 4.3.15 Statistics 
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare mean DTD 
activities of uninfected and Ad5 .DTD- - infected HT29 ceiis. This procedure involves 
calculation of 1) each activity variance fiom the overall mean; 2) variance within group 
(uninfected or 
A~S.DTD~~ - infected cells) means; and 3) variance between group 
means. The Student's t - test was used to compare the mean survivd of BE cells infected 
with A~S.DTD- at a MOI of 100 for 48 hours and uninfected controls. ANOVA of 
regression was used to compare the MMC sensitivities of HT29 cells infected with 
A~s.DTD~'~' and uninfected controls. 
4.4 Results 
4.4.1 Ceneration of AdS.DTD to Tmnsduce Cells Expressing Low Levels of 
DTD 
The Ad5 shuttle vector, pAElsplB, was modified by insertion of a CMV 
promoter, a multiple cloning site, and a BGH poly A sequence derived fiom the plasmid 
pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, Figure 4.1). DTD cDNA encoding the DTD 609C or 609T 
isoforms 
was 
incorporated 
into 
these 
modified 
shuttle 
vecton 
(Figure 4.2) to generate 
pAE 1 sp 1 B .DTD- or pAE 1 sp l B .DTD~'~? Each piasmid was individually cotransfected 
with the Ad5 packaging vector, pJM17, into 293T cells to produce A~S-DTD- or 
A~S.DTD~~. PCR diagnostic analysis (Figure 4.3) of the A~S.DTD- and A~S-DTD- 
vectors confirmed the presence of both DTD cDNA (bp 261 -721) and Ad5 sequences 
corresponding to the fiber protein coding region (bp 5861 - 6 15 1 of Ad5 genome, fiom Figure 4.3: PCR diagnostic analysis of A~S.DTD- and A~S.DTD-. Total genomic 
DNA was isolated from A~S-DTD- and A~s.DTD~~ and subjected to PCR 
amplification as described in 'Materials and Methods.' PCR reactions were run on a 1% 
agarose gel. A) PCR reactions using 20 mer primers complementary to DTD cDNA 
(forward and reverse primers start at bp 261 and 721 of DTD cDNA, respectively). Lane 
1; 123 bp ladder, Lanes 2 and 3; AdS-DTD shuttle vectors used to construct A~S.DTD- 
and A~S.DTD-. respectively, and included as a positive molecular weight control, Lane 
4: A~S.DTD~, Lane 5; A~~.DTD~~, Lane 6; no DNA template (negative 
contamination control). B) PCR reactions using 20 mer pnmers complementary to Ad5 
genome encoding for a fiber protein (forward and reverse primers start at bp 5861 and 
615 1 of Ad5 genome, respectively). Lane 1; 123 bp ladder, Lane 2; pJM17 Ad5 
packaging vector used as a positive molecular weight control, Lane 3; A~S.DTD-, Lane 
4; A~~.DTD~"~~, Lane 5; no DNA template (negative contamination control). PCR 
reactions represented in Lanes 3 and 4 used the same AdS.DTD genomic samples as in A) 
(Lanes 4 and 5) indicating the presence of both DTD cDNA and Ad5 fiber region in the 
sme sample and suggesting successful recombination between Ad5.DTD shuttle vecton 
and the pJM 1 7 packaging vector. pJM 17), indicating successful recombination between these vectors. The absence of 
contamination of viral stocks by wild-type recombinant Ad5 (produced by gaining host 
El sequences) was confirmed by failure of each of the AdS-DTD clones to generate a 
CPE in Hela cells (less than one wild-type recombinant per 6 x IO4 particles of viral 
stock), 
which 
are devoid of El sequences. 
A single base transition 
corresponding 
to nucleotide 609 of DTD cDNA (C to T) 
has been show to result in irnpaired DTD activity and decreased protein stability (Traver 
et al.. 1992; Misra et al., 1998; Chapter 2). HT29 cells (homozygous for the wild-t)p 
DTD dlele) displayed mean * s.e.m. (n=5) DTD activity of 1060 * 21 5 nmol / min / mg 
protein whereas BE cells (hornozygous for the variant DTD allele) contained very low to 
undetectable DTD activity (less than 20 nmol I min / mg protein). Consistent with the 
notion that the variant allele promotes decreased DTD protein stability, HT29 cells 
display 
Western blot reactivity whereas BE cells express very low to undetectable levels 
of DTD protein (Figure 4.4). In this blot. DTD protein was not detectable. However, low 
levels of the 609T isoform can be detected by increasing antibody incubation time and / 
or protein concentration (data not shown). 
4.4.2 Infection of HT29 and BE Cells with Ad5.B-ga1 
Previous studies of Ad5.B-gal infection of HT29 and BE cells demonstrated 40% 
and 100% infection efficiency, respectively (Dr. Henry Klamut, University of Toronto, 
persona1 
communication). This work verified that 
HT29 
cells are not as good hosts for 
Ad5 infection as BE cells (Figure 4.5). At a MOI of 100, only 15% of HT29 cells were 
infected with Ad5.D-gal whereas BE cells exhibited an infection efficiency of 90%. Figure 4.4: Western Blot analysis of DTD protein levels in HT29 (lane 1) and BE (lane 
2) human colon carcinoma cells. Blots were probed with a mixture of DTD monoclonal 
antibodies B77 1 and A 180 as descnbed in 'Materials and Methods' and were also probed 
for a, integrin expression as a protein loading control. MOI Figure 4.5: Infection efficiency of HT29 and BE cells by Ad5.B-gal. HT29 and BE cells 
were transduced with the E. coli P-gal gene under the control of the CMV promoter via 
Adj-P-gal infection at various MOIS. B-gal positive cells were stained 48 hours later as 
described in 'Materials and Methods.' Examples of A) HT29 and B) BE cells infected 
with Adj$-gal at a MOI of 100 are shown at 80X magnification. C) Infection efficiency 
of Ad5.B-gai was assessed by detemination of fiaction of P-gal positive cells. Each bar 
represent mean * s.d. of fraction of P-gal positive cells in five randomly chosen 4.3 mm' 
fields. Therefore, BE cells are capable of hi& infection eficiencies with recombinant Ad5 
vectors. 
4.43 Protein Expression of DTD Isoforms in Human Cells Homozygous for 
the Variant DTD Aiiele by Ad5.DTD Transduction 
The ability of each recombinant AdS.DTD to express DTD protein in human cells 
containing low to undetectable DTD activity was assessed by Western blot analysis 
(Figures 4.6 and 4.7). Monolayers of BE cells were infected with A~s-DTD- and 
Western blot reactivity was determined 48 hours pst-infection (Figure 4.6A). As shown 
in Figure 4.68, densitometry analysis indicated that BE cells infected at a MOI of 100 
contained approximately 3-4 times greater DTD- protein levels than cells infected at a 
MOI of 10 when normalized to integrin a, loading controls. A similar fold increase in 
expression of the 609T isoform, mediated by A~~.DTD~'~~ infection of BE cells at a MOI 
of 100 compared to a MOI of 10, was obse~ed 48 hours pst-infection (Figure 4.7). In 
this blot, the presence of the lower molecular weight band (0.5 - 1 kDa smaller than wild- 
type DTD) may be a result of proteolytic processing or chemical degradation of the 609T 
isoform (Dr. David Ross, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, personal 
communication) and was included in the densitometry analysis.

dominant negative effect 
(Levine, 
1990), 
three 
dishes of HT29 monolayer cultures were 
infected with A~S-DTD- at a MOI of 100 and DTD activity was determined 48 hours 
later and compared with 3 dishes containing unidected controls (Figure 4.8). Dm 
enzymatic activities did not significantly differ between A~.DTD- infected HT29 cells 
and uninfected cells (p > 0.1, one-way ANOVA). This result is qualified by the fact that 
the Ad5 infection efficiency of HT29 cells is 1 5-40%. 
4.4.5 Activity of Exogenous Wüd-Type DTD Mediated by A~S.DTD- in BE 
Cells 
The ability of A~~.DTD- to express fùnctional exogenous DTD was tested by 
determining DTD activity in BE cells at different times post-infection. In particular, this 
kinetic 
study was used to assess whether sufficient exogenous DTD activity can be 
achieved in hurnan cells for in vitro MMC sensitization- 106 BE cells were infected with 
Ad5 .DTDmC at a MOI of 10 or 100 and DTD activity was assessed at various time points 
as indicated in Figure 4.9. BE cells infected at 100 MOI with A~S.DTD- displayed a 
linear increase in DTD enzyme activity up to 72 hours pst-infection. Activity peaked at 
around 2400 mol DCPIP reduced / min / mg protein. Beyond this point, ceIIs began to 
lifi (monolayers reached confluency at 48 hours pst-infection) and did not survive. 
In one experiment, BE cells infected with A~S.DTD- at a MOI of 100 were 
trypsinized and re-seeded at a 1 :2 dilution and activity was determined 48 hours later (96 
hour time point). Enzyme activity at this point remained high (around 2000 nmol DCPIP HT29 control HT29 + AdSDTD 609T

Figure 4.9: DTD enzyme activity kinetics in BE cells. 106 BE cells were infected with

determined at the times shown pst-infection. Each point indicates the mean * s.e.m. of 
three independent experiments. In addition, in one experiment, BE cells infected with 
A~S.DTD~~' at 100 MOI were trypsinized and haif the cells were re-seeded at the 48h 
time point and DTD activity was determined 48h later (trypsin, 96h time point, n = 1). reduced / min / mg protein), indicating that exogenous DTD continued to be expressed 
afier 
trypsinization. 
However, cells infected at a MOI of 10 had a lower rate of increase of Dm 
activity than cells infected with a MOI of 100, which p!ateaued after 24 hours at around 
250 nmol DCPIP reduced I min / mg protein. At 48 hours pst-infection, cells infected 
with a MOI of 100 displayed DTD activities of around 1320 * 70 nmol DCPIP reduced / 
min / mg protein, which is similar to that observed for HT29 cells. 
Therefore, 
A~S.DTD- 
at a MOI of 100 provides for linear increases in DTD 
activity in BE cells with time and within the range of DTD activity in HT29 cells. 
Exogenous DTD 
activity 
continues to increase for 
at 
lest 96 hours. However, optimal 
ce11 
viability for MMC exposure studies is maintained up to 48 hours pst-infection for 
BE cells. 
4.4.6 Clonogenic Suwival of AdS.DTD Infected Cells Exposed to MMC 
The HT29 / BE human colon carcinoma pair has ken previously used to 
demonstrate the association of the variant DTD allele with MMC resistance (Traver et al., 
1992; Winski et al., 1998). In accordance with previous acute 1 hour MMC exposure 
studies comparing àrug sensitivity of human cells containing wild-type and variant DTD 
alleles (Marshall et al., 1991), BE cells displayed a 56 fold resistance to MMC compared 
to HT29 cells when assessed for colony forming ability 12- 14 days after exposure (Figure 
4.1 OA). To examine whether exogenous expression of wild-type DTD could sensitize 
resistant 
cells to MMC, BE ceIls were infected with A~s.DTD- at a MOI of 100 and

were 8-fold more sensitive to MMC compared to cells infected with A~S-DTD-, as 
determined by ratio of the doses of MMC required to achieve 1 log ce11 kill from the 
initial PE. However, untreated BE cells infected with A~S.DTD- had a reduced plathg 
efficiency 
compared to uninfected 
controls 
(mean PE * s.e.m., n=3. was 0.45 * 0.1 1 
versus 0.69 * 0.12, respectively, p < 0.05, Student's t - test) indicating toxicity due to 
expression of exogenous wild-type DTD. This toxicity is most likely not due to the vector 
itself 
since 
untreated BE cells infected with A~~.DTD~'~~ at a MOI of 100 had a pplating 
eficiency 
of 0.8 1 * 0.14 (Figure 4.1 OB). BE cells infected with A~S.DTD- exhibited 
no major increase in MMC sensitivity, consistent with previous observations of impaired 
catalytic 
activity and protein instability of the DTD 609T isoform (Traver et al., 1997; 
Misra et al., 1998; Chapter 2). 
As shown in Figure 4.10C, exogenous expression of DTD was confirmed in cells 
infected with A~S-DTD- by assessing DTD activities in cells that were infected in 
parallel with the MMC sensitivity studies described above. HT29 cells infected with 
A~~.DTD~'~' at a MOI of 100 were 2-fold more sensitive to MMC than uninfected 
controls in 
terms 
of ratio of doses required to achieve 1 log 
ce11 
kill from 
their 
initial PEs 
(Figure 4.10B), despite exhibiting similar DTD activities as wiinfected cells (Figure 
4.1 OC). ANOVA of regsession indicated that HT29 cells infected with A~s.DTD- at a 
MOI of 100 were signficantly more sensitive to MMC than uninfected controls (p < 
0.0 1). These results show that A~~.DTD- cm be used to sensitize BE cells to MMC in 
vitro by providing DTD activity similar to HT29 cells after 48 hours infection at a MOI 
of 100. 4.4.7 Effeet of Titration of MOI of A~S.DTD- on MMC Sensitinty of BE 
Cells 
To assess the effect that different levels of exogenous wild-type DTD expression 
would 
have on MMC sensitivity, BE cells were infected with A~~.DTD- at MOIS 
ranging from 3 to 100. DTD activities 48 hours pst-infection increased linearly with 
MOI (Figure 4.1 1 A). As before (Figure 4.1 OB), BE cells infected with ~d5 .DTD- at a 
MOI of LOO displayed reduced plating efficiency (mean PE * s.e.m. was 0.42 * 0.06) 
compared to 
uninfected 
controls. Also, as shown in Figure 4.1 IB, drug sensitivity was 
dependent on MOI. Similar acute MMC toxicities were observed between BE cells 
infected with A~~.DTD- at a MOI of 60 and uninfected HT29 cells. However, these 
cells 
displayed 
less than 50% of the DTD activity (mean * s.e.m. was 495 * 1 3 nmol 
DCPIP reduced / min / mg protein, Figure 4.1 1 A) of Hl29 cells (1060 * 2 15 nmoI 
DCPIP reduced / min / mg protein) 
In 
this 
experirnent, BE cells infected with Ad5.DTDm at a MOI of 100 exhibited 
4-5 tirnes increased toxicity due to MMC relative to a MOI of 60. This can be seen by 
plotting plating efficiencies in Figure 4.1 1B as fold increases in MMC sensitivity relative 
to BE cells infected with A~S.DTD~~ (in terms of ratio of doses corresponding to 1 log 
ce11 kill from initial PE) at a MOI of 100 as a Cunction of MOI, as shown in Figure 4.12. 
Since DTD activity determinations in HT29 cells can vq by as much as 2-fold fiom one 
experiment to another, it is possible that 
MOIs 
greater than 60 are required to achieve 
equivalent MMC toxicity in BE cells. These results show that transduction of BE ceils 
with A~~.DTD- provides for a continual increase in the sensitization to MMC, from 
MOIs of 60 to 100. O 20 40 60 80 100 MOI

Bioreductive enzyme - prodmg therapy involves the use of compounds that 
undergo 
metabolic reduction to 
cytotoxic 
metabolites 
(Workman, 
1993). One bder to 
this 
approach is the presence of 
insufficient 
levels of activating enzymes in tumor tissue 
(Belcourt et al., 1998). DTD is a bioreductive enzyme that can activate a variety of 
prodrugs, including quinone-based dmgs, to DNA alkylating agents. DTD activity has 
been reported to be elevated in a range of tumor types (Fitzsimmons, 1996) such as in 
hwnan non-small ce1 lung cancer (Kepa and Ross, 1999; Marin et al., 1997), breast, liver 
(Belinsky and 
Jaiswal, 
1993), 
and colon 
turnors 
relative to 
surrounding 
normal tissue. It 
has been proposed that various prodrugs that are substrates for DTD could be usefid for 
the treatment of tumors with high DTD activity (Beall et al., 1995). 
However, not 
al1 
tumors 
express elevated levels of DTD. For example, 
heterogeneity in DTD expression has beeiï reported in the National Cancer lnstitute 
(USA) human tumor ce11 line panel, which includes ce11 lines denved fiom leukemic, 
lung, colon and breast turnors (Fitzsimmons et al., 1996). This conclusion was based on 
both DTD mRNA expression levels and Western blot analysis. Heterogeneity was 
observed both within and across tumor ce11 types but a correlation was observed between 
DTD expression and MMC sensitivity in this panel. DTD enzymatic activity has also 
been 
show 
to be comparable in breast and lung turnor samples relative to corresponding 
normal tissue (Marin et al., 1997). Further complicating the heterogeneous nature of DTD 
expression across tissue types is the role of a single base change, a C to T transition in 
nucleotide 609 of DTD cDNA, confemng a predicted proline to serine change in arnino 
acid 187. This base change is frequent in the population (Chapter 1, Section 1.3.2; Chapter 5, Table 5.1) and has been associated with reduced catalytic activity, protein 
instability, and MMC resistance (Traver et al., 1992, Misra et al., 1998; Chapter 2). 
One way to address this problem is to introduce a bioreductive enzyme like DTD 
into tumor cells using gene transfer techniques (Searle et ai., 1998). Such a gene therapy 
approach to deliver activating enzymes to sensitize human tumors to prodrugs has been 
most 
widely 
used 
with 
non-marnmalian 
enzymes, 
such as herpes simplex virus - 
thymidine kinase (Esandi et al., 1997) and E. coli cytosine deaminase (Block et ai., 2000) 
in combination with the nucleoside analogues gancyclovir and 5-fluorocytosine, 
respectively. In the 
curent study, human DTD coding sequences were delivered using a 
fvst generation (El and E3 deleted) replication incompetent adenoviral vector to increase 
DTD activity and sensitize tumor cells to MMC. To test the MMC sensitization effect 
mediated by AdS.DTD in viîro, recombinant adenoviral vectors were constructed that 
express either the DTD wild-type 609C or mutant 609T isoforms under the control of a 
CMV promoter (A~s.DTD- and A~S .DTD-). 
BE cells express low to undetectable levels of DTD activity and protein (Figure 
4.4) and are good hosts for Ad5 infection (Figure 4.5). Infection of BE cells, which are 
homo 
ygous 
for the variant allele, with A~s.DTD- at a MOI of 10 or 100 resulted in 
high levels of recombinant DTD expression that increased with increasing MOI (Figure 
3.6). Sirnilarly, expression of the DTD 609T isoform could be demonstrated 48 hours 
post-infection of BE cells with A~S.DTD~~ at a MOI of 10 or 100 in BE cells (Figure 
4.7). These results demonstrate, qualitatively, that increased levels of recombinant DTD 
expression occur with increasing MOI. The DTD protein levels in BE cells infected with A~S-DTD- at a MOI of 100 versus 10 was consistent with their ratio of DTD activities 
at 48 hours post-infection (Figure 4.9). 
Relating recombinant DTD protein levels to enzymatic activity may be 
complicated by the possibility of a dominant negative effect (Levine, 1990) on DTD 
activity in cells expressing the variant allele. This also poses a potentiai barrier for the 
sensitization by AdS.DTDMPC of MMC resistant tumor cells which express the variant 
allele. To test this possibility, HT29 cells, which are homozygous for the wild-type DTD 
allele, 
were infected with the mutant Ad5.DTD609T at a MOI of 100 and cellular DTD 
activity was assessed 48 hours pst-infection. Since expression of the 609T allele did not 
have an appreciable effect on endogenous wild-type enzymatic activity (Figure 4.8), it is 
predicted that the mutant allele does not exert a dominant-negative effect. 
These 
results are qualified by the low infection efficiency of Ad5 towards HT29 
cells (Figure 4.5) and by the fact that the level of mutant DTD protein was not assessed. 
However, over-expression of the 609T 
isoform 
in 
cells 
homozygous for the wild-type 
DTD allele has recently been shown by others to not affect cellular DTD activity despite 
being present at levels up to 5-fold in excess of wild-type protein (Leith et al., 2000). 
Therefore, it is unlikely that the 609T isoform can mediate a dominant-negative effect on 
wild-type DTD which allows tumor cells expressing the variant allele to be effectively 
transduced by A~S-DTD-. 
The ability of A~~.DTD- to provide for fùnctional exogenous DTD expression 
in tumor cells was demonstrated by the linear increase in DTD activity with time 
following 
infection at a MOI of 100, where activity peaked at 2400 nmoI / min / mg 
protein 
at 72 hours pst-infection (Figure 4.9). This is consistent with previous work dernonstrating that wild-type DTD protein has a half life that is greater than 24 houn 
(Siegel et al., 2000). The culture conditions did not allow activity determinations beyond 
this time point, since the cells lif'ted off shortly after achieving confluency. However, 
expression of exogenous 
wild-type DTD in BE cells likely extends beyond 72 hours post- 
infection. This was demonstrated by infection of BE cells with A~S.DTD- at a MOI of 
100, followed by trypsinization and re-seeding of half the cells at 48 hours pst-infection. 
DTD activity assessrnent 48 hours later hdicated greater than expected activity (2000 
nmol / min / mg protein) when accounting for ce11 dilution. 
At a MOI of 10, BE cells infected with A~S.DTD- also displayed an increase in 
DTD activity with time, although at a lower initial rate than at a MOI of 100. However, 
activity 
appeared 
to level off after 24 hours. This effect cannot be explained by 
differences in 
ce11 growth rates since uninfected controls and BE cells infected with 
A~S-DTD~ at a MOI of 10 and 100 reached confluency at the same time, between 48- 
72 hours. The levelling-off of DTD enzyme activities after 24 hours in BE cells infected 
with A~~DTD- at a MOI of 10 may reflect a balance between the rates of recombinant 
DTD production and degradation which may level off to 10-fold higher leveis in BE cells 
infected at a MOI of 100. The levelling off points rnay represent maximal production of 
recombinant DTD protein from the fraction of cells that were infected at a MOI of 10. 
These 
results demonstrate that high expression of recombinant DTD protein occurs over 
3-4 days post-infection with A~s.DTD- and that a MOI of 100 provides an advantage 
over a MOI of 10 for achieving higher tevels of DTD activity in BE cells. 
In MMC sensitization studies, BE cells were treated with MMC 48 hours post- 
infection with A~S.DTD- at a MOI of 100. Of the two MOIS and various times pst- infection of A~S.DTD- tested, a MOI of 100 for 48 hours was chosen because it results 
in maximal DTD activity without toxicity and optimal cell viability (Figure 4.9). 
Untreated BE cells display a 5-6 fold increase in MMC resistance compared to HT29 
cells (Figure 4. LOA). However, treatment with A~S.DTD- at a MOI of 100 resulted in a 
8-fold increase in MMC sensitivity relative to BE cells infected with A~S.DTD- at a 
MOI of 100 when assessed by clonogenic survival 12-14 days subsequent to a 1 hour 
exposure to MMC (Figure 4.10B). Transduction of BE cells with A~S-DTD- at a MOI 
of 100 resulted in a 1.5-fold reduction in plating efficiency. Treatment with A~S.DTD- 
at a MOI of 100 had no effect on BE ce11 swival, indicating that increased sensitivity to 
MMC can be attributed to expression of exogenous wild-type DTD, and not to the Ad5 
vector 
itself. 
The presence of BE cells that are MMC resistant due to faihre of 
A~S.DTD~~ to tramduce and / or infect these cells is unlikely since drug sensitization by 
this vector 
appeared 
to be present down to 4 to 5 logs of cell kill. This indicates that 
complete 
A~S.DTD- 
transduction of BE cells cm be achieved at a MOI of 100 in vitro. 
Interestingly, HT29 cells infected with A~S.DTD- were 2-fold more sensitive to 
MMC compared to uninfected controls (Figure 4.10B) despite exhibiting similar DTD 
activities (Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.1 OC). Even when accounting for the observation that 
DTD activity determinations can Vary up to 2-fold with HT29 ce11 extracts, the reason for 
the increased sensitivity of 
Ad5.DTDm - infected cells is unclear since there was no 
apparent effect on their plating efficiency compared to uninfected controls, as seen with 
similar infection of BE cells. One possibility for the increased sensitivity of A~~.DTD- 
- infected HT29 cells is more efficient metabolism of MMC by exogenous DTD. The 
small 
degree of additional MMC sensitization may be due to infection of 1540% of these ce1 1s by ~d5 .DTD-. Another possi bility is that cellular compartmentalization of DTD 
may determine the degree of MMC reduction. However. no precedent for these 
possibilities has been found. 
DTD activity increased linearly in BE cells as a fûnction of MO1 of A~S.DTD- 
up to a MOI of 100. (Figure 4.1 IA). Also, MMC sensitization of BE cells was shown to 
be dependent on MOI of A~S.DTD- since a senes of viral titrations (Figure 4.1 1 B) at a 
MOI of 3: 10, 30, 60, 100 resulted in a 0.7, 1 .O, 1.1, 3, and 8-fold increase in MMC 
sensi t ivity compared to uninfected controls, respective1 y (Figure 4.1 2). There fore, 
exogenous DTD activities and MMC sensitivities of BE cells infected with A~~.DTD- 
did not saturate at MOIS up to 100. 
The inability of currently available gene therapy vectors to sensitize al1 cells in a 
turnor 
population may be partially obviated by two approaches utilizing 1) the bystander 
effect observed with CB 1954 (Vile et al., 2000); and 2) use of enzyme 1 prodrug systems 
that are more efficient than DTD / MMC to increase the effective dose of active 
metabolite capable of generating a bystander effect towards 
untransduced 
cells. Another 
human DTD isofonn, containing a glutamine to tyrosine substitution in arnino acid 104 
(Q 104Y), displays a 6-fold greater catalytic activity towards CB 1954, similar to rat DTD 
(Chen et al., 1 997). 
In summary, first generation recombinant Ad5 vectors have been constmcted that 
can stably express both the wild-type (609C) and 609T DTD isoforms in hurnan cells. 
Treatrnent of 
MMC-resistant BE cells with A~S.DTD- was shown to increase MMC 
sensitivity by 8-fold. This result raises the possibility that a gene therapy approach based 
on DTD expression in tumor cells resistant to MMC can be developed to treat tumors in vivo which, in general, are heterogeneous in DTD activity. Incorporation of DTD 
isoforms that are more cataiytically efficient than wild-type DTD, and the use of dmgs 
that exhibit a substantial bystander effect, wouid significantly improve the thetapeutic 
potential of this strategy. 4.6 References

Discussion and Future Directions An important requirement for the treatment of tumors with bioreductively 
activated 
prodnigs 
is the 
presence 
of enzymes capable of 
carrying 
out the process of 
activation 
(Stratford 
and 
Workrnan, 1 998). Treatment of tumors with specitic dmgs suc h 
as mitomycin C (MMC) that are activated by DT-diaphorase @TD) illustrates the 
potential for use of enzyme-directed prodrug therapy (Workman and Stratford, 1993). 
The heterogeneous nature of DTD expression in twnor cells (Marin et al., 1997) has 
limited the eficacy of bioreductive dmgs that are substrates for this enzyme- A fiequent 
point mutation that results in decreased DTD activity and protein stability (Traver et al., 
1992) has prompted interest in how it affects the role of this enzyme not only as an 
activator of bioreductive dmgs, but also as a xenobiotic detoxifier leading to the 
prevention of carcinogenesis (Ross et al., 1993). The following section discusses the 
implication of the work presented in the previous three chapters in relation to recent 
studies of the nature of the DTD 609C to T point mutation and developments in the field 
of gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy. The final sections of this chapter describe 
future directions and conclude with an overall summary. 
5.1 Role of the 609C to T Nucleotide Substitution in DTD cDNA 
Studies of the possibility of targeting MMC to radiation-resistant hypoxic turnor 
cells (reviewed by Rockwell, 1992) led to the identification of 
ceIl 
lines and strains that 
are resistant to 
this 
drug 
under 
aerobic conditions (Marshall et al., 1989). This resistance 
was lost under hypoxic conditions and these cells were found to be deficient in DTD 
activity (Marshall et al., 1991). It was subsequently shown that one electron reductases 
control 
this 
differential 
aerobic / hypoxic cytotoxicity towards MMC, whereas DTD is important for its aerobic toxicity (Belcourt et al., 1996). As discussed in Chapter 1.3.1, 
work by Ross and 
CO-workers 
(1992) with cells exhibiting a range of sensitivities to 
MMC, in particular with HT29 and BE human colon carcinoma cells, led to the 
association of the DTD 609T allele with impaired catalytic activity and MMC resistance. 
This association raised four main questions: 1) Does this base change result in a 
fùnctionally 
mutant DTD protein? 2) If so, how? 3) How does this mutation affect DTD 
function in terms of its role as a detoxification enzyme and as a dmg activating enzyme? 
4) Can genotypic status predict for phenotype? 
5.1.1 Relationship of C to T Base Change with DTD Enzymatic Activity and 
Protein Stability 
Direct evidence that the serine 187 DTD isoform is functionally mutant for 
enzyme activity was provided by examination of expressed and purified recombinant 
protein 
fiom E. coli (Traver et al.. 1997; Wu et al., 1998). These products exhibited 2 - 
10% of the catalytic activity of wild-type DTD depending on the substrate used to test 
enzyme activity . Similarly, mammalian ce11 transfectants expressing the serine 1 87 
isoform displayed 10-fold lower cellular DTD activity compared to wild-type DTD 
transfectants (Chapter 2; Misra et al., 1998). It has recently been shown that the serine 
187 DTD isoform is more susceptible to proteasome - mediated degradation compared to 
wild-type DTD (Siegel et al., 2000). This is consistent with the lower levels of DTD 
protein in the 609T compared to 609C COS4 ce11 transfectants and very low to 
undetectable Western blot reactivity in ce11 lines and strains that are hornozygous for the 609T allele (Figures 3.5 and 4.4). Therefore, the C to T base change is a mutation that 
impairs enzymatic activity and results in decreased protein stability. 
5.1.2 Nature of the C to T Mutation 
Detailed examination of serine 187 isofonn expression by Siegel et al. (2000) 
revealed that not only do mRNA tranxripts of wild-type and mutant DTD have similar 
half-lives. they are translated with equal efficiency. "s-methionine labeling and 
cycloheximide 
treatment 
of HT29 and BE cells revealed that the wild-type DTD isofonn 
was not degraded over a 24 hour period while mutant DTD was completely degraded in 2 
hours. This effect was also seen with purified DTD isoforms that were expressed in a 
rabbit 
reticulocyte 
lysate (RRL) system. Furthemore, general protease inhibitors, such as 
cysteine or serine protease inhibitors, did not prevent degradation of mutant DTD. 
Degradation of mutant DTD was, however, prevented by the proteasorne inhibitor clasto- 
lactacystin p-lactone. Degradation was also ATP - dependent and mutant DTD purified 
from the RRL system reveaied proteins of increased molecular weight which were 
immunoreactive for ubiquitin. Rapid degradation via the ubiquitin - directed proteasomal 
pathway could account for the presence of only trace amounts of mutant DTD protein in 
cells that are homozygous for the DTD 609T mutation. 
Overexpression of mutant DTD in BE cells via A~s.DTD~"~ infection resulted in 
the presence of DTD protein of a molecular weight that is 0.5 - 1 kDa smaller than wild- 
type DTD (Figure 4.6). Densitometric analysis demonstrated that the amount of protein 
corresponding to the lower band was approximately 3 and 0.25 times the amount relative 
to the upper band, at a multiplicity of idection (MOI) of 10 and 100, respectively. The lower band has also been observed in immunoblots of mutant protein punfied nom E. 
coli (Dr. David Ross, personal communication, University of Colorado Health Sciences 
Center), but 
only 
at relative levels to the upper band closer to that seen with BE cells 
infected with A~S.DTD- at a MOI of 10 (Le. present at 3-fold greater levels than the 
upper band) 
Beigleiter 
(personai 
communication, Manitoba 
Institute of Cell Biology) and co- 
workers have also detected both bands in heterozygotes by Western blot analysis under 
stringent conditions involving longer 
length 
gel 
separation and low current. In the 
analysis of heterozygotes by Beigleiter and CO-workers, the relative levels of the lower to 
upper bands 
varied. 
It 
is 
possible that high levels of mutant DTD present in BE cells 
infected at high MOIS may saturate the degradative processing of this isofom, resulting 
in a 0.25: 1 ratio of the lower to the upper band. 
Recently, the crystai structure of hurnan wild-type DTD was detemined to 1.7 A 
resolution (Faig et al., 2000). Sirnilar to the crystal structure of the rat enzyme (Figure 
13, discussed previously in Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2, amino acid 187 of the hurnan DTD 
protein does not appear to contribute to dimerization or the active site. It has been 
proposed that a serine substitution at amino acid 187 results in a lower *nity towards 
FAD and impaired catalytic activity (Wu er al., 1998). Altematively, the proline to serine 
187 substitution could result in a change in native conformation that makes the mutant 
serine 187 isoform more susceptible to degradation via the ubiquitination - directed 
proteasomal 
pathway . 
The degradative product corresponding to the lower band is unlikely to be 
proteasorne - mediated since no higher molecular weight bands indicative of ubiquitination. Also, the proline to serine change does not appear to resdt in a novel 
cleavage site for 
proteases 
that 
would 
generate a 0.5 - 1 kDa fragment. This is consistent 
with the inability of general protease inhibitors to protect against degradation of mutant 
DTD. However, it is possible that changes in conformation of the mutant isoforrn may 
create a proteolytic cleavage recognition site other than within amino acid 187. 
If a high concentration of purified mutant DTD is dissolved in a protease - free 
buffer solution at room temperature or at 37 OC, both the upper and lower bands are seen 
by Western blot 
analysis 
(Dr. David Ross, 
personai 
communication, University of 
Colorado 
Health 
Sciences Center). 
With 
increasing incubation 
time, 
the concentration of 
protein 
corresponding 
to the lower band increases relative to the upper band. This 
observation 
suggests 
that the lower band represents a chernical degradation product of the 
mutant isoform. Having established that the 609C to T base change is a point mutation 
that impairs DTD activity and results in protein instability, studies of the serine 187 
isoform with the aim of providing a structure - function basis for this mutation are 
warranted. 
5.1.3 Genotype vs. Pbenotype 1: Frequency Analysis of the Variant Allele 
and the Role for DTD in Xenobiotic Detoxification 
Since the C to T mutation results in a DTD protein that is defective for enzymatic 
activity and has decreased stability, it has raised the issue of how it affects physioiogicai 
DTD function. This was first addressed by estimating its prevalence in the population. 
The possibility that 
penetrance 
of this DTD mutation is associated with impairment of 
xenobiotic 
detoxification (in tems of its relevance as a defense mechanism against disease) and chemotherapeutic dnig activation has prompted a number of mutational 
fiequency studies (surnmarized in Table 5.1). These studies compared groups fiom 
disease-fiee populations to those exhibiting various types of cancer. They also include 
correlative studies of DTD activity relative to the presence of the nucleotide 609C to T 
change in ce11 lines and strains (Traver et al., 1992; Traver er al., 1995; Misra et al., 
1998; Chapter 2). 
Ethnic variation (Table 5.1) has ken observed in the fiequency distributions of 
the wild-type and variant alleles of DTD (Wiencke et al., 1997; Kelsey et al. 1997; 
Gaedigk et al., 1998; Chen et al., 1999), with the mutant allele occurring at fiequencies 
as high as 0.49 in a Chinese population. The fiequency of the variant allele may reflect 
regional environmental pressures relating to metabolism of dietary products or xenobiotic 
detoxitication as hypothesized for other polymorphic drug metabolism enzymes such as 
the cytochrorne P450s (for review see Nebert et al. 1999). 
A number of studies have associated increased fiequency of the variant allele with 
various chernical toxicities and malignancies (Table 54, such as benzene-related 
hematotoxicity 
(Rothrnan et al., 1996; Moran et al., 1999), acute leukaemia (Wiemels et 
al.. 1999). rend cancer and urothelial carcinoma (Schulz et al., 1997), as well as in 
benign prostatic 
hyperplasia 
(Steiner et al., 1999). However, in the case of lung cancer, 
some reports have shown no relationship between lung cancer and the variant allele 
(Traver et al., 1997; Bouchardy et al., 1999). No change was seen in the fiequency of the 
variant allele in lung tumor biopses compared to surrounding normal tissue (Siegel et al., 
1999), and one study even found an association between the variant ailele and decreased Table 5.1: Summary of some reports describing A) the occurrence of the variant in 
human populations; B) its association with either toxin exposure; or C) cancer incidence.

frequency of the variant allele and lung cancer remains uncertain. 
A definitive conclusion as to whether impairment of DTD function contributed to 
the disease outcomes described in Table 5.1 cannot be presently made. The range of 
cancers 
examined was not oniy broad in nature but there was in~~cient evidence for 
their 
cause. A role for DTD in cancer prevention cannot be established until these causal 
factors are identified and the contribution of impaired DTD activity to carcinogenesis can 
be assessed. The establishment that DTD knockout mice are healthy but are highly 
sensitive to menadione toxicity (Radjendirane et al-, 1998) points to an anti-cancer role 
for DTD involving xenobiotic detoxification. However, these mice did not display an 
increased 
incidence of cancer. 
DTD has also ken show to protect against benzene related hematotoxicity 
(Rothman et al., 1996) through its ability to metabolize cytotoxic benzenes to inactive 
species 
(Sarlauskas et al., 1997). Furthemore, the degree of cellular sensitivity to 
benzene 
exposure was related to the allelic status of the variant allele (Moran et al. 1999; 
Table 5.1); i-e. cells homozygous for the wild-type allele had the lowest sensitivity, while 
heterozygotes displayed intermediate sensitivity and cells homozygous for the variant 
allele 
had the 
greatest 
sensitivities. 
These 
results 
implicate the variant 
allele as a genetic 
marker 
for benzene toxicity. 5.1.4 Genotype vs. Phenotype 2: The C to T Mutation as a Predictor of Dnig 
Response 
At present, a more definitive argument can be made for a role for the variant allele 
in encoding for a DTD mutant with reduced catalytic activity and protein stability than 
for its use as a genetic marker for cellular responses that depend on DTD activit~. As 
discussed in Chapter 3, there is considerable overlap in DTD activities between cells that 
are homo ygous or heteroygous for the wild-type allele (Figure 3 -3). nierefore, 
genotypic analysis can only provide a first approximation at the cellular level for 
response to 
dmgs 
that are DTD substrates. 
The low to undetectable levels of DTD protein associated with the variant allele 
observed in Chapters 2 and 3 is consistent with recent work by Siegel et al. (1 999), where 
DTD protein levels were quantified in human saliva samples by irnrnunoblot analysis 
relative to a recombinant DTD standard. This method provides for a non-invasive 
approach to relating 
wild-type DTD protein levels and DTD activity. As discussed above, 
the apparent lower molecular weight of the mutant DTD isoform is a useful property for 
identification and subsequent quantification of wild-type DTD in protein sampIes. In 
addition. 
PCR-based 
analysis would be usefùl for identification of heterozygotes since 
the upper band may potentially consist of a mixture of wild-type DTD and unprocessed 
mutant DTD, although the latter would be expected to be present in trace amounts. 
Therefore, 
these 
analyses may provide for a reliable prediction of the response of tumor 
cells 
to drug activation mediated by DTD in vivo. 5.1.5 A~S.DTD- as a Gene Therapy Vector 
Cwent cancer gene therapy vectors, including adenovinses, are unable to deliver 
transgenes 
to 
al1 
target 
cells in a tumor (Brenner, 1999). In addition, individual tumon are 
not equaily permissive to adenoviral infection due to differences in coxsackievirus- 
adenovirus 
and integrin a, receptor expression (Pearson et al., 1999). In this study, 
heterogeneous infection 
eficiencies 
were observed in BE and HT29 cells. BE cells were 
2-3 fold more receptive to Ad5 infection than HTî9 cells (Figure 4.5). 4-5 logs of ce11 
killing by MMC of BE cells infected with A~S .DTDM" at a MOI of 1 00 (Figure 4.1 1 ) is 
consistent with a transduction efficiency of 90-95% (this work, Figure 4.5) or 100% (Dr. 
Henry Klamut, University of Toronto, personal communication) at this MOI. However, 
the degree of 
ce11 
killing may be enhanced by a minor bystander effect. Such a bystander 
effect. calculated as a 1.3-fold reduction in MMC concentration required to achieve 
equivalent 
cell kill in mixed cultures consisting of equal numbers of BE and HT29 cells 
compared 
to pure cultures of BE cells, has been observed (Dr. Hugo Zhang, Ontario 
Cancer Institute, personal communication). This result illustrates the advantage of 
clonogenic assays to detect high levels of ce11 Ming compared to other less sensitive 
methods used to assess 
ce11 
viability, such as the use of 3-[4,S-dimethylthiazol-2-YI]-2,s- 
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Bridgewater et al., 1997). 
Infection of HT29 cells with AdCMV.Dga1 at a MOI of 100 resulted in only 15% 
(this work) to 40% (Dr. Henry Klamut, University of Toronto, personal communication) 
of the cells testing positive for Dgal expression (Figure 4.5). Furthemore, even though a 
high level infection of BE cells can be achieved in vitro, it is likely that a smaller fraction 
will be infected in vivo where a ratio of 100 infectious viral particles per ce11 will be difficult to attain since the virus will not be equally accessible to al1 cells. This limitation 
was seen by Lax (2000), where inira-tumoral injection of AdCMV.Dga1 at a MOI of 100 
in 
nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma 
xenografts 
resulted in transduction of only 25% of the 
turnor 
mass. 
The problem of heterogeneous infection of tumors by Ad5 vectors that deliver 
prodrug-activating enzymes may be partially offset by the use of drugs that can mediate a 
bystander effect (Vile et al., 2000), i.e. killing of cells exposed to activated prodmgs 
originating fiom cells able to carry out the activation. Gancyclovir is widely used for 
gene therapy applications 
with 
its 
activating enzyme, 
herpes 
simplex virus thymidine 
kinase (as discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.4.5). Since its activated metabolite, 
gancyclovir-triphosphate, is transferred by gap junctional intercellular communication 
(GJIC, Bi et al., 1993), another level of heterogeneity cornes into play involving variation 
amongst 
tumor 
cells in their ability to participate in GJIC (Princen et al., !999). Another 
combination that is 
widely 
used in gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy is the E. coli 
cytosine deaminase (CD) gene and the nucleoside analogue 5-fluoroc ytosine (5-FC, 
Lawrence et al., 1998). Unlike gancykovir-triphosphate, the activated metabolite of 5- 
FC, 5-fluorouracil(5-FU), does not rely on GJIC for its bystander effect. 
Although MMC may mediate a minor bystander effect, it is well documented that 
CB1954 displays strong bystander effects as high as 1000-fold (Searle et al., 1998) 
calculated as fold reduction of CB1954 concentration resulting in 50% ce11 kill in mixed 
cultures consisting of equal numbea of resistant and sensitive cells compared to pure 
cultures of resistant cells). As discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.4.5, the Chydroxylamine 
derivative of CB 1954 (Figue 1 -7) can rnediate a bystander effect via aqueous solution and ce11 uptake by passive diffusion. CB1954 provides an advantage over 5-FU in that its 
cytotoxicity is not ce11 proliferation-dependant and therefore may be capable of 
eliminating 
non-dividing tumor cells (Nishihara et al., 1998). 
As discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.4.5, although the bacterial nitroreductase is 
even more catalytically efficient towards CB 1954 activation than the Q 104Y isoform of 
DTD (90-fold more active than wild-type DTD, Anlezark et al., 1992), the Q104Y 
enzyme could provide an advantage over non-mammalian enzymes since it rnay be 
relatively non-immunogenic. It has been shown that breast cancer lines that stably 
express DTD Q104Y cDNA are more sensitive to CB 1954 than those expressing wild- 
type DTD (Wu and Chen, 1999). 
Another 
attractive candidate for viral directed enzyme-prodrug therapy 
is human 
NQ02 mAD(P)H:(quinone acceptor) oxidoreductase 21, since it is a dihydronicotinamide 
riboside (NRH) - dependent oxidoreductase that is 3000 times more effective than wild- 
type DTD in activating CB 1954 (Wu et al., 1997). However, although this enzyme rnay 
be non-immunogenic, its use for gene therapy requires NRH to be supplied exogenously 
since 
there 
may be insufficient amounts of NADH oxidation required to generate NRH in 
the host ce11 (Friedlos and Knox, 1992). 'Virtual cofactors' have been developed that 
have advantageous properties compared to naturally-occurring prodnig-activating 
cofactors. For example, nicotinic acid riboside reduced, a synthetic derivative of 
NADPH. can be supplied with bacterial NTR for enzyme-prodrug therapy since this 
virtual cofactor has an enhanced stability towards metabolic breakdown by serum plasma 
enzymes compared to NADPH (Knox et al., 1995). Therefore, the requirement for activation by a endogenous cofactor that is present in insufficient quantities may not be a 
limitation for the use of bioreductive enzymes in cancer gene therapy. 
An alternative to the utilization of enzymes which have superior hg activating 
capability than DTD is the use of dmgs that can be efficientiy metabolized by this 
enzyme. Analogues of 
compounds which themselves are considered better DTD 
substrates than MMC are in development. For example, Ross and CO-workers have 
synthesized an analogue of the aziridinylbenzoquinone, methyldiaziridinequinone 
(MeDZQ, Figure 5.1, in itself an analogue of MMC that can be reduced at a 2-3 fold 
greater rate by DTD) that is reduced by DTD at a 3-fold greater rate than MeDZQ 
(Winski et al., 1998). The compound, RH1 (Figure SA), is more water-soluble than 
MeDZQ, thereby overcoming formulation problems encountered with MeDZQ, and is 
being considered for clinical trials. In addition, Wilson, Demy, Siim, and colleagues have 
been developing new bioreductively activated drugs that are efficiently reduced by 
bacterial nitroreductases (Siirn et al., 1997; Demy and Wilson, 19%). Figure 5.1: Structures of MeDZQ and its analogue, RHl. Adapted fiom (Winski et al., 
1998). 5.2 Future Directions 
A better understanding of the nature of the DTD 609C to T mutation at a 
molecular level 
will 
involve 
detailed 
structural 
cornparisons 
of the wild-type and mutant 
isoforms. Also, with the limitation of curent viral gene therapy vectors to infect every 
ce11 in a tumor. it is necessary to explore other DTD isoform - prodrug combinations that 
are more 
efficient in dnig activation and in mediating a bystander effect than the wild- 
type DTD - MMC system. 
5.2.1 Structure and Properties of the Serine 187 Isoform 
X-ray diffraction studies with human wild-type DTD were used to demonstrate 
how 
conformational 
differences between rat and human DTD accounted for their 
di fferent binding affinities and catalytic activities towards CB 1954 (Faig et al., 2000).

(Siegel et al., 2000) provides an opportunity to use x-ray difhction to compare their 
structures when complexed with quinone substrates (Li et al., 1995). Since the location of 
amino 
acid 187 does not contribute to a fiuictional domain, x-ray difiaction analysis may 
reveal possible conformational differences between these DTD isoforms to explain their 
different activities and stabilities. Also, direct 
amino 
acid sequencing of the 0.5 - 1 kDa 
truncated 
mutant DTD or cornparison of fragmentation patterns obtained by mass 
spectrometry 
with wild-type DTD may dlow determination of the region that is 
susceptible to 
proteolytic 
or 
chernical 
degradation in mutant DTD. 
Byron et al. (1997) have used analytical ultracenûifigation to determine various 
States of oligomerization of DTD based on its sedimentation equilibrium observed at 275 nrn. This method can be applied to detect possible dimerization differences between the 
wild-type and mutant isofoms since dimer association can be disrupted by potassium 
isothioc y ante and monomer reassociation constants (kJ can be determined through 
equilibrium sedimentation after dilution of the destabilizing agent. Due to the similarity 
of their molecular weights, this method cannot be used to study the possible assembly of 
wild-type and mutant DTD monomers into heterodimers. However, conformational 
stabilities of dimers can also be measured by heat denaturation or in denaturing solvents 
such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride (Neet and Timm, 1994). This ailows 
determination of the 
temperature 
at 
which 
a 
monomer - dimer transition state occurs (Tm) 
as well as calculation of the dimer fkee energy of association. 
Isolation of heterodimers for structural detemination or evaluation of 
conformation kinetics can involve CO-expression of wild-type and mutant DTD cDNAs; 
each 
containing 
separate 
labels, 
such as histidine (Wu et al.. 1998) and FLAG tags 
(C hubet and Brizzard. 1 996). In this case, purification and separation of heterodimers 
fiom homodimers would involve use of afinity columns containing nickel nitrilotnacetic 
acid and antibodies for the FLAG epitope, respectively. Histidine tagging of both wild- 
type (Cui et al., 1995) and mutant (Wu et al., 1998) DTD has ken previously shown not 
to 
affect enzyme activity. Therefore, such studies can provide direct information 
conceming the structural consequences of the proline to senne 187 mutation. 
5.2.2 Evaluation of the Bystander Effect of CBl954 In Vitro and In Vivo 
A nurnber of in vilro assays have been developed to estimate dmg bystander 
effects in vivo. The HT29 / BE human colon carcinoma pair is usefûl for these studies since they both form isolated colonies with morphologies that can be easily distinguished 
from each other. Preliminary experiments involving acute exposure of MMC to co- 
cultures of HT29 and BE cells have been used to detect minor bystander effects (around 
1 -3-fold) associated with this dmg (data not shown). This may be due to activation of 
MMC in DTD-rich HT29 cells which then affects DTD-deficient BE cells. 
Co-cultures of CB 1954-resistant NIH 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts with cells 
that were rendered sensitive via retroviral mediated transduction with a NTR minigene 
have been used to demonstrate bystander effects (Bridgewater et al., 1997). This 
approach can be applied for mixed cultures of CB1954-resistant BE cells with cells 
transduced with DTD isoform minigenes via recombinant Ad5 delivery. A frequently 
used method to assess bystander effects of active 
metabolites that are water soluble is to 
transfer growth medium firom cultures of cells that can activate the drug to resistant cells 
(Bndgewater et al., 1997). This method has shown that the diffusable activated 
metabolite of CE3 1954 (Figure 1.7) has high stability, since exposure to the conditioned 
medium demonstrated 
cytotoxicity 
for at 
least 48 hours. 
Another 
candidate 
dnig 
for assessrnent of bystander effects using these 
approaches is RH1. Initial work has shown that RH1 is stably reduced by DTD since 
activation did not 
result 
in detectable oxygen consumption associated with auto-oxidation 
and inactivation (Dr. David Ross, personal communication, University of Colorado 
Health Sciences Center). Therefore, the studies discussed above cm be used to compare 
the relative 
therapeutic 
effects of various DTD isoform - prodrug combinations in ternis 
of both in vitro clonogenic survival and the production of active difisable metabolite. Of 
particular interest is the NQO, - CB1954 combination due to the high activation efficiency of NQO, towards this dmg as well as the potential advantage of using a 
relatively non-imrnunogenic hurnan procimg-activating enzyme for gene therapy 
(Brenner, 1999). 
Tumors denved fiom cells stably transfected with minigenes for prodnig- 
activating enzymes can provide an in vivo assessrnent of the relative efficacy of various 
enzyme - prodrug combinations. This approach has been previously used to establish a 
line of BE cells that were stably transfected with wild-type DTD (Winski er al., 1998) to 
screen for 
drugs 
that are DTD substrates. BE cells are normally resistant to these dmgs 
due to the variant DTD allele, ailowing this method to be used to test the efficacy of other 
DTD isoforms since they have low to undetectable background DTD activity. HT29 and 
BE cells have aiready ken show to form tumor xenografts in severe combined 
immunodeficiency 
mice 
(Curnmings et al., 1998) and they have been used as an in vivo 
screen for chemotherapeutic effects of dmgs that rely on DTD activation. 
The requirement of a dnig that mediates a bystander effect for adenovirus-directed 
enzyme-prodrug therapy 
is 
apparent 
when 
considering that adenoviruses 
penetrate 
tumors 
poorly. The effective depth of penetration of recombinant Ad5 is around 1 to 10 ce11 
layers 
from 
the tumor surface 
(Grace et al., 1999). Poor penetration of adenoviral vectors 
also limits their use for targeting hypoxic tumor cells in the intenor regions of tumors. A 
further possible limitation for the application of therapeutic Ad5 vectors to target hypoxic 
tumor cells is 
poor 
transgene 
expression of Ad5 
infected 
cells 
under 
hypoxia 
(see 
Appendix 5.1). This could also be due to inadequate infection efficiency of Ad5 under 
hypoxic conditions. Poor accessibility of Ad5 vectors also limits the use of hypoxia 
specific transcriptional enhancers to target tumor cells by selective transgene expression in hypoxic turnor cells. Therefore, activation of prodmgs in transduced aerobic cells in a 
tumor might be used to treat hypoxic regions via a bystander effect. 
5.3 Summary 
The stuc lies described in this thesis have shown that the DTD 609C to T base 
change is a mutation that impairs DTD activity and others have directly shown that it also 
results in 
decreased 
protein 
stability. 
Correlative studies of the 
allelic 
statu 
of the base 
change have shown that there is overlap in DTD activities between cells that are 
homozygous 
for the wild-type 
allele and heterozygotes. Therefore, from a therapeutic 
standpoint, quantitative assessrnent of individual DTD protein levels by immunoblot 
analysis 
provides 
for a more accurate method of predicting cellular responses that depend 
on DTD activity than fjïnfl-RFLP genotypic analysis. This work also demonstrates the 
feasibility of the use of Ad5 vectors to deliver wild-type DTD by rendering dmg-resistant 
human tumor cells hg-sensitive in vitro. It has also shed light ont0 the prospect for the 
use of DTD in an Ad5-directed gene therapy approach by addressing the application of 
DTD isofoms that are more catalytically efficient than wild-type human DTD and dmgs 
that are better substrates for this enzyme than MMC. This becomes important when 
considering differences in infection 
eficiency 
of Ad5 between hurnan tumor cells, such 
as HT29 and BE cells. Drugs that exert a bystander effect may offset the inability of 
current 
viral gene therapy vectors to infect or express transgenes in al1 cells in a tumor, in 
particular, 
radiation-resistant hypoxic tumor cells. 5.4 References

Transduction Efficieacy of Ad5 in Hypoxic versus Aerobic 
Human Tumor Cells AS. 1.1 Introduction 
The application of recombinant adenoviral type 5 vectors (Ad5) to deliver prodnig- 
activating enzymes to radiation-resistant hypoxic 
tumor 
cells relies on 
infection 
of a 
sufficient fraction of these cells. It also relies on sufficient amounts of gene expression in 
transduced 
hypoxic cells to sensitize 
them 
to their 
prodrug 
substrates. The 
possibility that 
hypoxic conditions modulate the infection efficiency of Ad5 was addressed by testing the 
relative 
transduction efficiency of Ad5 in aerobic 
versus 
hypoxic 
turnor 
cells. 
AS. 1.2 Materials and Methods 
2 x 1 o6 BE hurnan colon carcinoma and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma ce11 lines were 
seeded overnight in 8 oz glass prescription bottles (Fisher Scientific, Nepean, ON, 
Canada) with 20 mL of growth medium consisting of a-minimal essential medium 
containing 10% fetal calf serum (Cansera. Rexdale ON, Canada). Afier a 3 hour exposure 
to gas containing either 5% CO2 ; 95% air or 5% CO, ; balance N, at 37 "C, medium was 
removed using 25 mL glass syringes (Fisher Scientific) to maintain gassing statu 
followed by a 30 minute exposure to an Ad5 vector carrying a firefly Iuciferase minigene 
(suppIied by Dr. Henry Klamut, University of Toronto) under the control of the 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 in 1 mL of 
PBS @re-equilibrated with 5% CO, ; balance N, for hypoxic exposure). Previously 
removed conditioned medium, 
left 
in 
syringe, 
was 
repIaced 
followed by a Mer 24 hour 
incubation 
under 
hypoxic or aerobic conditions, at 
which 
time cells were harvested for 
luciferase activity detemination using an assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). To 
ensure 
linearity 
for the luciferase assay, titrations of ce11 lysate volumes were performed. AS. 1.3 Results 
As shown in Table AS. 1.1, aerobic BE and MCF-7 cells displayed 3-fold and 25-fold 
higher luciferase activities, respectively, relative to hypoxic conditions.

AS. 1.4 Conclusions and Discussion 
Lower luciferase activities in hypoxic versus aerobic conditions in BE and MCF-7 cells 
upon Ad5.CMV.luciferase infection suggests that Ad5 may infect permissive cells less 
eficiently 
under 
hypoxia. 
It 
is 
also 
possible that hypoxic and aerobic cells do not differ in 
their Ad5 uptake, but the former may provide for lower levels of transgene expression. 
BE and MCF-7 cells are equally permissive to Ad5 infection under aerobic conditions 
(Dr. Henry Klamut, University of Toronto, personal communication). The possibility of 
decreased Ad5 receptor expression in these cells under hypoxic conditions can be 
addressed by Western blot analysis of primary and CO-receptor levels after hypoxic 
exposure. Decreased viral uptake anaor transgene expression must be considered when targeting hypoxic tumor cells in a AdS-directed enzy me-prodrug therapy approach 
including possible use of hypoxia-specific tranxriptional enhancers
