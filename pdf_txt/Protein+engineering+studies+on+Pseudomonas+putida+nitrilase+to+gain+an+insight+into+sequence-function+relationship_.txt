Abstract: Nitrilases represent a very important class of enzymes having an array of applications. In the present 
scenario, where the indepth information about nitrilases is limited, the present work is an attempt to shed light on the residues crucial for the nitrilase activity. The nitrilase sequences demonstrating varying degree of identity with P. putida nitrilase were explored. A stretch of residues, fairly conserved throughout the range of higher (96%) to 
lower (27%) sequence identity among different nitrilases was selected and investigated for the possible functional 
role in nitrilase enzyme system. Subsequently, the alanine substitution mutants (T48A, W49A, L50A, P51A, G52A, Y53A and P54A) were generated. Substitution of the rationally selected conserved residues altered the substrate recognition ability, catalysis and affected the substrate specificity but had very little impact on enantioselectivity and pattern of nitrile hydrolysis.

Introduction
Nitrilases are well known for their unique ability 
to efficiently catalyze the nitrile compounds into the corresponding acids with the release of ammonia [1]. Nitrile hydrolysing enzymes are present in various species of bacteria, fungi and plants. Most of the known microbial nitrilases exist in the form of either homo oligo -
meric spirals or helices [2]. Members of the nitrilase superfamily exhibit conserved catalyt -
ic triad of Glu-Lys-Cys where cysteine is involved in imparting the nucleophilic attack on cyano group of nitrile. Nitrilases have been catego -
rised into three classes based on their sub -
strate specificity, which includes aliphatic, aro -
matic and arylacetonitrilases [3]. Some of the known nitrilases display relaxed substrate specificity indicating the occurrence of the phe -
nomenon of substrate promiscuity in the mem -
bers of this group of enzyme. In general, the promiscuous nature is believed to be crucial for the enzyme divergent evolution [4]. The members of nitrilase superfamily have been exploited at industrial level for the produc -
tion of various drugs/drug intermediates, fine chemicals and chiral synthones. They work effectively in mild condition with precise regio-, stereo- and enantioselectivity [5]. In spite of the established industrial importance, the indepth knowledge of the relationships between the sequence, structure and function in nitrilases is still lacking. Furthermore, very limited informa -
tion regarding the crystal structure of nitrilases is available [6]. However, the structures are available for other members of the nitrilase superfamily like amidases and nitrile hydratas -
es [7-9]. Various research groups have used either site directed mutagenesis or random mutagenesis to explore the nitrilase enzyme system [10, 11]. Mutational studies revealed the specific residues affecting the activity for substituted aromatic nitrile and substrate spec -
ificity of nitrilase from Rhodococcus rhodo -
chrous [12, 13]. Similarly, the residues affect -
ing the enantioselectivity and amide formation Residues crucial for nitrilase function
385 Int J Biochem Mol Biol 2012;3(4):384-391were identified for the arylacetonitrilase from 
Pseudomonas fluorescens  [14, 15].
In the present study, site directed mutagenesis of the selected conserved residues of P. putida nitrilase was performed. The residues of the selected stretch were found to be fairly con -
served throughout the higher (96%) to lower (27%) sequence identity. The mutagenesis was carried out to elucidate the possible role of these residues on nitrilase function and to characterize the key residues critical for nitrilase activity. 
Materials and methods
Materials
The gel extraction kit, restriction enzymes, T4 
DNA ligase, Taq DNA polymerase and DNA molecular weight markers were purchased from MBI fermentas, Germany. The primers used in the study were synthesized at Integrated DNA Technologies, USA. The nitrile compounds and IPTG were purchased from Sigma, Germany. Other chemicals were purchased from Hi Media, Mumbai, India.
Strains used and culture conditions
The arylacetonitrilase gene from P. putida 
MTCC 5110, cloned in pET-21 (b) vector (Novagen) and expressed in E. coli  BL21 (DE-3), was used for the present study [16-18]. The BL21 cells carrying the construct were initially grown at 37°C for 16 h in a Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After 16 h, 0.1% (v/v) culture was transferred to flasks containing the same medium and induced at 0.6 OD with IPTG (1 mM) for 6 h at 37°C.
Oligonucleotide directed site specific mutagen -
esis and gene cloningThe forward and reverse primers were designed 
for the generation of mutants with alanine sub -
stitution ( Table 1 ). The reverse primers were 
flanked either with BmgB I or BsrF I restriction 
sites (possible nearer restriction sites to the conserved stretch of amino acid) whereas the forward primer was flanked with BamH I restric -
tion site. It is to be mentioned that in each reac -
tion the same forward primer was used; only the reverse primer was different depending on the nature of the substitution. PCR was done in Eppendorf Master cycler gradient (Eppendorf AG, Germany) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94°C for 10 min followed by cycling conditions, denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 58°C for 1 min, elongation at 72°C for 1 min 30 sec (repeated for 30 cycles). Final extension at 72°C for 10 min was used to complete the reaction, resulting in amplification of nearly 200 bp in each case. Table 1. Primers used for construction of alanine substitution mutants

387 Int J Biochem Mol Biol 2012;3(4):384-391used for restricting the 909 bp PCR fragment 
and the restricted fragments were gel extract -
ed. The restricted 200 bp (in each case) and 909 bp fragment were ligated using 10 Weiss units of T4 ligase at 22°C for 16 h. The ligated 1kb band generated in each ligation mixture was gel extracted and individually regarded as insert. On the other hand, pET-21(b) vector was also digested with BamH I and XhoI and gel 
extracted. The ligation reaction was set up using gel purified vector and insert and the liga -
tion mixture was transformed in the BL21 cells. The presence of insert was confirmed by restric -
tion digestion analysis of isolated plasmids from the respective colonies. The presence of desired mutation was assured by sequencing the mutants at Bioserve, India.
Protein purificationThe recombinant cells harbouring either wild 
type nitrilase or mutant nitrilase were centri -
fuged individually at 10,000 x g for 30 minute at 4°C and resuspended separately in phos -
phate buffer (0.05 M, pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl and 15 mM imidazole. Cells were lysed by sonication for 15 min. The resulting cell suspensions were then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C and cell lysate was collected in each case. Meanwhile, the Ni-NTA matrix (Qiagen, USA) was equilibrated with phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 8.0) con -
taining 300 mM NaCl and 15 mM imidazole. The generated lysate was filtered through 0.45µ filter and then applied to the equilibrated Ni-NTA column. Flow through was collected and the column was washed with the same buffer containing 20-70 mM imidazole to wash out the loosely bound proteins. The C-terminal His-tagged nitrilase was finally eluted from the col -umn using 250 mM imidazole in phosphate buffer (0.05 mM, pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl. The eluted protein was dialysed against phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4). Protein con -
tent was estimated by Bradford’s method [19]. The purification was assured by the SDS-PAGE (12%) gels.
Measurement of nitrilase activity and kinetic 
parameters
Nitrilase activity was determined by the modi -
fied Berthelot method [20]. The reaction mix -
ture containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 
7.4), 12.5 mM mandelonitrile (in ethanol) and nitrilase enzyme was incubated at 37°C for 20 min and the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl 1N HCl. For the determination of kinetic parameters, the nitrilase activity was estimat -
ed over a range of mandelonitrile concentration (2 to 50 mM) and the parameters were calcu -
lated from Lineweaver-Burk plot. For the deter -
mination of optimum temperature, nitrilase activity was estimated at various temperatures following the standard assay method. 
Determination of rate of conversion and pref -
erentially formed enantiomer
For determining the rate of conversion of man -
delonitrile to mandelic acid, the Reversed 
Phase High Performance Liquid Chromato-graphy (RP-HPLC) was used. The reaction was carried out using 12.5 mM mandelonitrile in ethanol and 20 mg/ml recombinant cells har -
bouring either wild type or mutant nitrilases in phosphate buffer. The sample was withdrawn after 2 h and the cleared supernatant was used to analyse the mandelic acid formed in the reaction mixture. C18 Waters column (250 ×4.6 mm, 5μm, USA) was used at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/ min with a mobile phase of phosphate buffer (0.01 M , pH 4.6) and acetonitrile (55:45, v/v) as solvent system and absorbance was monitored at 245 nm. The retention times for mandelic acid, mandelamide and mandeloni -
trile were 2.93, 3.70 and 7.56 minutes respectively.
The chiral HPLC was employed to determine the 
enantiomers of mandelic acid using CHIRALCEL-OD-H column (250 x·0.46 mm, 5 μm) (Daicel Chemical Industries, USA) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with a mobile phase of hexane, isopro -
panol and tri fluoro acetic acid (80: 20: 0.2, v/v) Table 2.  Kinetic analysis of the alanine substi -

Results and discussion
Sequence identity search to select the resi -
dues contributing to nitrilase functionality
The nitrilase sequences demonstrating varying 
degree of identity (96 to 27%) with P. putida nitrilase were selected through protein BLAST search. The multiple sequence alignment was performed to identify the residues, apart from the catalytic triad of Glu-Cys-Lys, which remain conserved throughout the selected range of sequence identity. In the present study, a stre -
tch of fairly conserved residues was explored further by site directed mutagenesis ( Figure 1 ). 
Within the selected stretch, the residues ‘Pro-Gly-Tyr-Pro’were even found to be fairly conser -
ved in other members of nitrilase superfamily like cyanide hydratases and cyanide dihydrata -
ses [3, 21, 22]. Conservation of these residues in other members of nitrilase superfamily apart from the members displaying true nitrilase activity indicates that these are probably the evolutionary or functionally important residues.
Sequential alanine substitution of the selected 
residues and kinetic analysis
The residues of the selected stretch were indi -
vidually replaced with alanine in a sequential 
manner to create the substitution mutants; T48A, W49A, L50A, P51A, G52A, Y53A and P54A. Alanine was selected as a substitution residue of choice as it does not possess the side chain beyond the β-carbon, thus it neither alters the main-chain conformation nor impos -
es extreme electrostatic effect [23]. The sub -
unit molecular mass of the variant enzymes in SDS/PAGE were approximately 43 kDa like wild type enzyme. These masses were similar to the Table 3. Enzyme activities of wild and mutant nitrilases for various nitrile substrates

5.8 as calculated using compute pI/MW tool. Expression levels of the variant nitrilases were not found to be affected by the substitution. Each of the generated mutants retained suffi -
cient activity such that their steady state kinet -
ics could be studied. Kinetic parameters of the purified mutant nitrilases were determined for the hydrolysis of mandelonitrile ( Table 2 ). The 
indepth analysis suggested that amongst the generated mutants, G52A, P54A, Y53A affect -
ed the k
cat drastically while L50A and P51A sub -
stitution largely affected the KM. G52A, P54A 
and Y53A substitutions led to almost 12 fold reduction in k
cat. Moreover, G52A and Y53A 
mutants retained KM comparable to the wild 
type enzyme but showed substantial reduction in k
cat. This suggests that the residues G52A 
and Y53A are essential for maintaining the proper hydrolytic ability. The residues W49A, L50A, P51A and P54A are crucial for proper substrate recognition, binding and hydrolysis.
Effect of site specific alanine substitution on 
substrate specificity
The role of the conserved residues in hydrolys -
ing the range of nitriles including aliphatic, aro -
matic and arylacetonitriles was analysed. The 
mutants W49A, L50A, G52A, Y53A and P54A showed overall decreased activity for all the tested substrates as compared to the wild type 
enzyme ( Table 3 ). The P51A mutant exhibited 
very low hydrolytic activity for arylacetonitriles and no activity for the aliphatic and aromatic nitriles. However, unlike other generated mutants, T48A mutant interestingly displayed the ability to catalyze the arylacetonitriles/aro -
matic nitriles comparable to the wild type 
nitrilase. A thorough observation of the 
sequence alignments done by other groups [3, 22] revealed that in few nitrilases, the alanine residue was originally present in the conserved 
stretch in place of threonine. This suggests that 
probably in the native organism, the nitrile-
hydrolysing activity was supported by the ala -
nine residue. This could be a plausible reason for the observation where the T48A mutant revealed comparable activity to that displayed by the parental enzyme. However, this mutation did not favour the activity for the aliphatic/ het -
erocyclic nitriles tested in the present study and displayed 50-80% reduction in activity for 
these substrates with respect to the wild type 
nitrilase. This observation suggests that T48A 
mutation has considerably decreased the pro -
miscuous nature of the existing enzyme as compared to the wild type enzyme and thus it 
may be a determinant residue required for the 
enzyme to catalyze various nitriles with differ -
ent functional groups ( Table 3 ).

390 Int J Biochem Mol Biol 2012;3(4):384-391Influence of substitutions on enantiospecificity 
and other parameters
The effect of these mutations on the conver -
sion of mandelonitrile to mandelic acid was 
determined through reversed phase HPLC (Table 4 ). All these mutations except T48A 
showed marked reduction in the conversion rate. Like the wild type enzyme, the mutant enzymes did not show the formation of man -
delamide as an intermediate during the conver -
sion of mandelonitrile to mandelic acid. There was no production of mandelic acid when man -
delamide was used as a substrate, thus indi -
cating that the substitution of the selected resi -
dues did not influence the manner by which the nitrile hydrolysis reaction occurred. Furthermore, the influence of these residues on enantiospecificity was investigated by Chiral HPLC. The chiral analysis demonstrated that all the constructed mutants preferentially formed the ( R)-enantiomer of the mandelic acid with 
the enantiomeric excess (ee %) comparable to the wild type enzyme ( Table 4 ). These results 
suggested that although the selected residues proved to be crucial for maintaining the sub -
strate specificity and catalysis, but had very lit -
tle impact on the enantioselectivity and pattern of nitrile catalysis.
The involvement of selected stretch of con -
served residues in the above tested parame -
ters encouraged the investigation of its effect 
on the ability of the enzyme to withstand ther -
mal stress. Among all the mutations of the con -
served stretch, T48A mutation influenced the thermostability. The activity-temperature pro -
file of all the mutants has been shown in Figure 
2. The T48A mutant exceptionally showed its 
ability to act at elevated temperatures unlike the wild type enzyme and other mutants. The maximum activity of the T48A mutant was found to be in the range of 50-60°C contrary to wild type and other mutants. Currently, the investigation of the role of this mutation for inducing the ability to act at higher temperature is in progress.
