Synthetic aromatic compounds consisting of various functional groups are known as dyes. These colored
compounds are often discharged in efﬂuents, and they are very dangerous to aquatic life. Basically, thedye industry started by using natural plant and insect sources, and then suddenly turned into artiﬁcialmanufacturing. Natural equilibrium of our environment gets changed by the reduction in photosynthetic
activity due to the dyes. In China 900,000 tons of all kinds of dyes are usually produced, which are used in
many industries like food, textile, food, paper and leather. Untreated wastewater contaminates aquaticbodies by causing eutrophication, change in water color, oxygen depletion which affect aquatic organ-
isms to a great extent. Dye wastewater is now the key environmental pollution form. In recent eras an
extensive study line has been developed to explore the dye decolorization and biodegradation under bothaerobic as well as anaerobic conditions. In this review, the chemistry, toxicity and microbial biodegrada-
tion/decolorization are presented. Some recent studies along with the new techniques and methodolo-
gies of remediating the dye pollution are also discussed to provide the bases of their handling. Overall,efﬁcient and high biodegradation potential make microbes an impending foundation for green chemistryto eradicate toxic dyes from industrial wastewater.

1. Introduction
The aromatic compounds, azo dyes, consisted of one or many -
N@N- groups. These aromatic compounds also have a major class
of synthetic dyes utilized in various commercial areas. Theseman-made colored compounds are being utilized in many indus-
tries like fabric industry, food industry, leather industry and paperindustry and are also used in other industries as cumulative in dif-
ferent products ( Brown and De Vito, 1993 ). These dyes contribute
up to 40 % of dying pollution in developing countries like India and
Bangladesh ( Rawat et al., 2018 ). Azo dyes have made their large
use in the food industry as they impart signiﬁcant appearance toprocessed foods and make them appealing to their users. Natural
dyes are less stable as they degrade but azo dyes are much stable
on the other hand to be used freely in food processing ( Yamjala
et al., 2016 ). In laboratories azo dyes are used as pH indicators or
biological stains. It is being noted that only 85 % dye gets attached
to clothes and remaining 15 % is wasted in water as an efﬂuent
(Tripathi and Srivastava, 2011 ).
Large amounts of industrial efﬂuents are generated by these
industries every year causing mainly the aquatic pollution quite
dangerous for aquatic biota as well as for plants and other animals
like human beings ( Gao et al., 2018 ). Many different approaches
(physical, chemical and biological techniques) are now being used
by scientists for dyes removal from wastewater ( Sarkar et al.,
2020 ). Some examples of azo dyes are Trypan Blue, Lithol Red,
Orange I, Orange II, 4-Phenylazo-Naphthylamine, Methyl Red,
Allura Red, Sunset Yellow, Yellow AB, Carmoisine, Mercury Orange,

and Phenylazophenol with their reduced aromatic amines. The
degradation and reduction of azo dyes produce such compounds
that are harmful and mutagenic in nature ( Rawat et al., 2018 ).
The holistic and large scale notion is required to handle these
chronic dyes to know whether the toxicity is caused by degraded
dye products or by the parent molecule itself. Carcinogenicity of
some azo dyes is observed without being cleaved into aromatic
amines ( de Campos Ventura-Camargo and Marin-Morales, 2013 )
which are resistant to biodegradation due to their xenobiotic nat-
ure. Various physicochemical methods including photocatalysis,
activated carbon adsorption, ion exchange, advanced oxidation,
and ozonation have been used to decolorize such dyes ( Malik
et al., 2017; Rawat et al., 2018 ). These processes are very expen-
sive, and require huge amounts of chemicals and energy. Moreover,
use of such processes generate large amounts of sludge containingaromatic amines which become toxic after use to living organisms
including humans ( Vikrant et al., 2018; Ajaz et al., 2019; Shindhal
et al., 2021 ).
The peculiarity of the present review is that it highlights the
various aspects of azo dyes including dye nature, dye reduction,
dye toxicity and dye degradation through various microbes includ-
ing bacteria and fungi. Moreover, it also addresses the current and
future prospects for the mitigation of azo dyes microbial-based
remediation approaches.
1.1. Chemistry of azo dyes
Due to the high afﬁnity of dyes with water, these colored sub-
stances are used in aqueous form. Chromophore group, present
in the chemical structure of azo dye, mainly contributes in coloring
and is commonly used in leather, textile, or food industry ( Franco
et al., 2018 ). By-products of petroleum and earth minerals are used
to form the synthetic dyes. A variety of dyes like synthetic dye,
basic dye, acidic dye, oxidation dye, anthraquinone dye, acridine
dye are used in the textile industry but mostly the reactive dyes
such as azo dyes are used. These dyes cover most of the area in syn-
thetic aromatic dyes class which are excessively used in dyeing.
Azo dyes are water soluble with huge commercial interest and
have single or many azo ( /C0N@N/C0) and sulfonic (SO
3/C0) groups.
Azo dyes may have more than one azo linkage. The dyes consistingof one nitrogen-nitrogen bond (N @N) are called monoazo dyes;
likewise are the, diazo dyes, triazo dyes, and polyazo dyes
(Fig. 1 ), having the two N @N bonds, three N @N bonds or more than
three N @N bonds respectively ( Muniyasamy et al., 2020 ).
On the basis of hydrophobicity, azo dyes are categorized into
two classes;
(a) Hydrophobic azo dyes: these are reduced intracellular after
bacterial cell uptake.
(b) Hydrophilic azo dyes: these are reduced extracellular.
Azo dyes are non-ﬂuorescent in nature, so to track their path-
ways the ﬂuorescent probes are used. The alkyl bond binds these
probes to azo dyes. On the basis of different azo dye usage pur-
poses various types of azo dyes are used for dyeing. All the dye
used for dyeing does not get ﬁxed to the fabric but releases outside
as a waste and by mixing in water causes environmental pollution
with various health maladies.
2. Mechanism of azo dye reduction
For azo compounds, reduction is the most important reaction
which occurs in mammalian liver in the presence of azoreductases.
It is estimated that bacterial azo dye reduction might be non-
enzymatic. But bacterial azo dye degradation is observed under
anaerobic or aerobic conditions both. Reduction involves the –NN– bond breakage with aromatic amines metabolites formation
(Cao et al., 2018 ).
Reduction processes may occur by different methods, such as
enzymes, redox mediators of low molecular weight, and chemical
reduction through biogenic reductants. This reaction could be
intracellular or extracellular. In mammals, the intestinal microor-
ganisms in the gastrointestinal tract degrade the water soluble
azo dyes but liver enzymes can metabolize the water insoluble
azo dyes. Anaerobic bacteria are mostly present in the gastroin-
testinal tract, which are quite active in metabolizing compounds
including azo compounds. These microﬂora reduce the azo dyes
into mutagenic and toxigenic substances. Thus, the reduction of
azo dyes, a signiﬁcant process of azo compounds, plays a key role
in mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of such dyes ( Chung, 1983 ).
3. Textile coloration with azo dye
The dispersive dyes are used through suspension as they are
insoluble in water and are used on cellulose ﬁber and other
hydrophobic ﬁbers. The dye is hydrolysed and the precipitation
of basically insoluble formation occurs in dispersed form on the
cellulose acetate in the dyeing. Usually, all of this happens with
long chains dispersing agents used for the dye suspension stabi-
lization, which facilitates addressing with the hydrophobic ﬁber
(Gottlieb et al., 2003 ). To dye the manufactured ﬁbers i.e., cellulose
acetate, polyester, nylon, and polyamide azo dyes are commonly
used. It is observed that almost 3,000 types of dyes are present
in the market and almost 50 % of them belong to azo dyes class.
Azo dyes present a great variety of colors with permanence prop-
erties having excellent ﬁxation characteristics when compared to
the natural dyes.
4. Toxicity of azo dyes
Many research laboratories used animals as a model organism
to check the exact toxic effects of these azo compounds and their
Fig. 1. Classiﬁcation of azo dyes bonds as monoazo, diazo, triazo and polyazo
(Benkhaya et al. 2020 ).S. Zafar, D.A. Bukhari and A. Rehman Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 29 (2022) 103437
2derivatives on living organisms ( Parrott et al., 2016 ). Several stud-
ies related to degradation and metabolites formation have been
conducted to establish the strategies to lessen the dangerous
impacts of these compounds on living organisms. The biological
and toxicological activities of each dye differ greatly, despite the
fact that they may belong to similar groups with the same chemi-
cal structure ( Chen et al., 2018 ). Extreme water pollution, affecting
the aquatic biota is the most deleterious impact of uncontrolled
azo dyes released in water bodies. Under these stressed environ-
mental conditions, the living organisms face many problems, like
for light absorption reduction in organisms and production of dif-
ferent amines under anaerobic conditions ( Rawat et al., 2018 ).
Different studies have presented that azo dyes are accumulated
to an alarming level into the environment with toxic, mutagenic
and carcinogenic effects, and different damages to organisms occurdue to their biotransformation products ( Ismail et al., 2019 ).
Recently the genetic toxicology of some azo dyes has been
reviewed by researchers ( Hassan and Carr, 2018; Shindhal et al.,
2021 ).
After azo dyes reduction mutagenic activity is observed. With
relation to the original compound, the aromatic amines formed
as metabolites during reduction can show their toxic effects
according to their chemical structure. Azo dye reduction can pro-
duce the DNA adducts, which could be toxic even to discolourizing
microorganisms. Probably toxicity involves more than one reduc-
tion process ( Alderete et al., 2021 ). The produced sludge also con-
tains dyes which can leach into landﬁlls and by mixing with water
harm the aquatic creatures ( Ganesh et al., 1994 ).
4.1. Toxicity of azo dyes in humans
Azo dyes are compounds having diazotized amine combined to
phenol or amine with more than one azo linkage with the precur-
sor of aromatic amines. In humans’ azo dye benzidine is associated
with bladder cancer with high risk in dye workers. Azo dyes pose
harmful effects like genocity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity
to humans along with other animals ( Chung and Cerniglia, 1992 ).
Human skin microﬂora, intestinal microﬂora and liver azoreduc-
tase are able to reduce azo dye. Toxicity is also observed in some
azo dyes that do not reduce into aromatic amines. But various
human tumors are observed due to carcinogenic effects of cleaved
aromatic amines like benzidine. Human oral exposure to azo dyes
results in aromatic amines formation, by intestinal microﬂora and
liver azo reductases with carcinogenic properties. In highly indus-
trial countries, intestinal cancer is prevailing, so there is a large
connection between high cancer cases and huge azo dye uses in
these countries. Beside this many other human maladies have also
been observed ( Chung, 2016 ).
4.2. Toxicity in plants
Azo dyes presence and toxicity have been seen in plants due to
release of azo dyes into the environment. Azo dyes show their
effects in the following three ways.
a-By reducing the photosynthetic activity.
b-By reducing plant growth.
c-By decreasing soil quality.
In water stressed countries it is common practice to irrigate soil
with grey water. The soil irrigated with grey water has the follow-
ing properties i.e. reduction of soil pH, increase in soil salt and
organic matter content with change in macro or micro nutrients
concentrations. Dye contaminated textile wastewater can acceler-
ate ethylene synthesis in plants. Red HE3B (Reactive Red 120) tox-
icological study showed the oxidative stress and a high abundance
of chromosome aberrations with micronuclei in the root cells of
some plants. The rate of damage induced was much higher inDNA by the dye itself, instead of its metabolites. The genotoxicity
and mutagenicity of azo dyes are treated much effectively by chlo-
rination ( Xu and Li, 2010 ).
4.3. Toxicity in other animals
Azo dyes toxicological effects are also observed in other ani-
mals. For example, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of p-
dimethylaminobenzene (p-DAB) in bone marrow cells and sperma-
tozoids of rats are shown by the mitotic index and chromosome
aberrations. In rats fed with p-DAB, many chromosomal aberra-
tions and nuclear abnormalities in germ cells are observed.
Researchers have concluded that clastogenicity, a mechanism of
micronuclei formation within mammalian cells, is induced by the
textile dyes. The azo dye C.I. Disperse Blue 291 dye toxicity, by
fragmentation of DNA, micronuclei formation and increase in rate
of apoptosis in mammalian cells (HepG2) is also being observed.
Sudan azo dye genotoxic and mutagenic effects in humans and
bladder of other mammals are also observed. The aneugenic and
clastogenic actions of azo dyes are also observed for the test organ-
isms ( Han et al., 2020
).
The mutagenic and carcinogenic effects of 3-methoxy-4-
aminobenzene against bacteria and rats have been reported ( Abe
et al., 2018 ). Other cancers like splenic sarcomas, bladder cancer,
hepatocellular carcinomas, cell anomalies and chromosome aber-
rations are also observed due to some azo dyes exposure. These
hazardous effects of azo dyes and their metabolic products occur
due to their direct effect on the cells ( Abe et al., 2018 ) which inter-
acts with DNA molecules, and damages them. In rodents the car-
cinogenic and teratogenic effects with malfunctioning of
reproductive organs is also observed due to azo dyes ( Parrott
et al., 2016 ). In benthic organisms including mammals and ﬁshes
these hydrophobic compounds produce lethal effects for their sur-
vival and growth ( Milani et al., 2018 ).
5. Azo dyes degradation by microbes
Microorganisms have devised some mechanisms to degrade azo
dyes ( Fig. S1 ). The microbial effectiveness to degrade azo dyes
totally depends on the selected strain ability. Microbial biodegra-
dation is cheap and economical with less sludge production
(Meerbergen et al., 2018 ). Mineralization of azo dyes is reported
in Basidiomycetes. By different mixed and pure cultures of bacte-
ria, decolorization of azo dyes is being reported under anoxic con-
ditions ( Guo et al., 2020 ).
5.1. Azo dyes degradation by bacteria
Extensive studies are done to get to know about the role of bac-
teria in dye decolorization. The xenobiotic compounds like azo
dyes are recalcitrant to biodegradation and are mineralized by cer-
tain microorganisms including the bacteria ( Naraginti et al., 2016 ).
They have some enzyme systems which decolorize and mineralize
the azo dyes under certain environmental condition ( Zhang et al.,
2010 ). Several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria i.e. Bacillus subtilis ,
Pseudomonas sp.,Lactobacillus sp.,Staphylococcus sp.,Enterococcus
sp.,Corneybaterium sp.,Xenophilus sp.,Clostridium sp.,Acinetobacter
sp.,Rhizobium sp.,Micrococcus sp.,Rhabdobacter sp.,Dermacoccus
sp., Klebsiellla sp., Proteus sp., Alishewanella sp., Morganella sp.,
Aeromonas sp.,Alcaligenes sp.,Shewanella sp., and E. coli have been
reported to degrade or decolorize azo dyes ( Ajaz et al., 2019; Chang
and Kuo, 2000 ). For decolorization Pseudomonas sp. is widely used
and several genera of Basidiomycetes for azo dyes mineralization
are used ( Hsueh and Chen, 2007 ).S. Zafar, D.A. Bukhari and A. Rehman Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 29 (2022) 103437
3Very few aerobic bacteria are reported to reduce azo dyes, with
diminutive knowledge of their process ( Rakkan and Sangkharak,
2020 ). On the other side a notable number of anaerobic bacteria,
which can reduce azo dyes are reported. In bacterial metabolism
the reductive breakage of dyes leads to aromatic amines formation
(Srinivasanet al., 2020 ). Many mixed and pure cultures of bacteria
are used to decolorize azo dyes under aerobic and anoxic environ-
ments ( Ambrosio and Campos-Takaki, 2004 ). Under these condi-
tions with respect to organisms and dyes the reaction is
somewhat non-speciﬁc. In this non-speciﬁc reductive cleavage,
enzymatic and low molecular weight redox mediators are used
(Fig. 2 ). There are very few bacterial strains known which can
use azo dyes as growth substrate ( Pandey et al., 2007; Sarkar
et al., 2017 ).
5.1.1. Azo dye degradation under anaerobic environments
Dye degradation in aerobic environments is not much studied
and known but anaerobically dye degradation is studied exten-
sively ( Seshadri et al., 1994 ). Acidogenic and methanogenic bacte-
ria are studied for their dye degradation and decolorization
activity. Many different bacterial groups like acidogenic, aceto-
genic and methanogenic bacteria are involved in methanogenic
dye for complex organic compounds degradation. Carbon in the
form of starch, glucose, acetate, ethanol and complex ones includ-
ing whey and tapioca is utilized as energy source in dye decoloriza-
tion process ( Manu and Chaudhari, 2002 ). In methanogenic
conditions, glucose is considered as the most preferable substrate
in anaerobic decolorization of dye. But for anoxic dye decoloriza-
tion by facultative anaerobes and fermenting bacteria the glucose
suitability may vary. Adverse effect of glucose by reduction in pH
(due to acid formation) under anoxic conditions is observed in
some bacterial cultures. In anaerobic conditions, azo reductases
use redox mediator as electron transporter by bounding with cell
membrane. Membrane azoreductase mediators binding mecha-
nism is different from cytoplasmic azoreductase. As the azoreduc-
tase is oxygen sensitive in nature so degradation occurs more
efﬁciently in anaerobic conditions.
Dye structure and used carbon source affect the rate of decol-
orization. Under anaerobic decolorization, the dye might work as
electron acceptor by electron transport chain carriers. The dye
color change depends on the carbon source added and dye struc-
ture. Otherwise reduced compounds (formed through anaerobic
biomass) in non-speciﬁc extracellular reactions may be attributed
for dye decolorization (Türgay et al., 2011).The anaerobic azo
reduction is also achieved by immobilized redox mediators, it
increases the rate of reduction due to its high catalytic potential
(Olivo-Alanis et al., 2018 ).
5.1.2. Azo dye degradation under the aerobic conditions
Many strains of bacteria which can degrade azo dyes under aer-
obic environments are known to scientists. Bacteria cannot
degrade azo dyes freely in aerobic environments ( Ajaz et al.,
2020 ). Organic carbon source is required to get energy as azo dyes
cannot be utilized as substrate ( Chittal et al., 2019 ). Azo dyes are
electron deﬁcient, decolorization under reducing conditions form
aromatic amines ( Fig. S2 ) and they are further converted into
non-toxic end products under the oxidizing-conditions. Thus
aerobic-anaerobic treatment techniques seem to be more efﬁcient
and economical for decolorization of azo dyes as these are used as
a source of carbon and nitrogen by some aerobic bacteria during
metabolic activities ( Sponza and Is /C223ik, 2002; Ajaz et al., 2019 ). A
study has been reported that A. aquatilis 3c metabolized Synazol
red 6HBN enzymatically into various end products. Firstly, pyrrolo
[1,2-a ] pyrazine-1,4-dione derivative like structure formed through
desulfonation and oxidative deamination which can be involved in
amino acid metabolism and eventually produce 3C compound i.e.pyruvate which ultimately can be changed into acetyl-CoA to con-
tinue energy yielding process, Krebs cycle ( Fig. 3 ). Secondly, phtha-
late derivatives are produced as a result of desulfonation,
carboxylation, and oxidative deamination which can be converted
into aldehydes and fatty acids. Such molecules can enter directly/
indirectly into fatty acid catabolism to yield acetyl-CoA, FADH 2
and NADH 2(Ajaz et al., 2019 ).
An improved mixed culture of bacteria and fungi is in focus for
azo dye degradation purposes ( Mani and Hameed, 2019 ). Under
anaerobic conditions the redox mediators like ﬂavins or quinones
are produced which then are reduced either by cellular enzymes
or by the environmentally abundant reductants. Few bacterial
strains that use azo dyes as growth substrates (narrow range)
are reported. Generally, two stages are followed by bacteria to
degrade azo dyes. First stage is reductive breakdown of azo link-
ages which results in -generally colorless but potentially harmful -
aromatic amines ( You and Teng, 2009 ). This reduction requires
only the anaerobic conditions whereas the aromatic amines
biodegradation is an entirely aerobic process. So for the efﬁcient
treatment of wastewater a combination of aerobic and anaerobic
conditions is therefore the best scheme to remove azo dyes from
wastewater.
5.2. Azo dye degradation by fungi
The selective fungi have the potential for azo dye degradation
by different mechanisms and play an important role in cleaning
up our environment ( Table 1 ). Bioremediation is considered as
the most effective technique for dye degradation rather than
physicochemical processes. A salt tolerant yeast strain Galacto-
myces geotrichum is known to degrade and detoxify azo dye aero-
bically ( Guo et al., 2019 ). Likewise, a potentially harmful azo dye
Methyl orange which gets absorbed into the skin and could be
inhaled is degraded by brown rot fungi ( Purnomo et al., 2019 ).
Some other strains of fungi like Penicillium sp., Aspergillus niger
Fig. 2. Bacterial azo dye reduction by azoreductase and redox mediators ( Sarkar
et al. 2017 ).S. Zafar, D.A. Bukhari and A. Rehman Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 29 (2022) 103437
4and Cladosporium sp. are identiﬁed as azo dye Red 3BN degraders
(Praveen and Bhat, 2012 ).
Minimal media was used as a selective method to isolate the
azo dye degradation. Because of huge production of biomass and
rapid growth characteristics, many species of fungi are investi-
gated for their ability to azo dye degradation. Mixed fungal cul-
tures may beneﬁt the azo dye degradation by attacking at
diverse positions on dye molecules and by production of in-
between metabolites for next mineralization and conversion into
neutral forms ( Krishnamoorthy et al., 2018 ). For azo dye degrada-
tion a variety of different enzymes like laccase, azoreductase, man-
ganese dependent or independent peroxidase and lignin
peroxidases are secreted by microorganisms. Fungal biosorption
methods without metabolites formation by forming complexes
with dye are used for removing dye from the solutions ( Almeida
and Corso, 2019 ).
Wood-rotting fungi, a dominant agent of wood degradation, are
distinguished by their degrading ability of lignin and cellulose.
Some wood-rotting fungi, mainly white-rot fungi, have capacity
for bioremediation applications with vague systems. To depoly-
merize and mineralize the complex and headstrong lignin poly-
mers this system is developed by fungi. This system of lignin
degradation in fungi is not substrate speciﬁc. These fungal strains
are capable of mineralizing a variety of environmental pollutants
as well ( Sen et al., 2016 ).
Uptill now, the white rot fungi, particularly Phanerochaete
chrysosporium is known as the common microorganism for dye
degradation. Penicillium genus is also reported as the azo dye
degrader. At the same time, in large number of bacteria such as
Sphingomonas xenophaga BN6, Pigmentiphaga kullae K24 and
Caulobacter subvibrioides C7-D, the azoreductase activity has
been recorded recorded ( Solís et al., 2012 ). As there are a huge
variety of azo dyes under use in many different ﬁelds, there is a
need to identify more microorganisms which can degrade and
decolorize them under optimal conditions with suitable enzyme
production ( Abd El-Rahim et al., 2017 ). The treated water by all
these means should be reused in irrigation and other areas to
pace water and protect our environment ( Singh et al., 2019 ). It
will also save the transfer of dye pollutants into other media
(Zhu et al., 2000 ).
A large number of experiments, with use of crude extracellu-
lar enzymes preparations of ligninolytic fungi systems or whole
cultures are done on dye efﬂuents degradation. By these enzy-
matic and non-enzymatic systems, the decolorization of azo,
anthraquinone, heterocyclic, triphenylmethane and polymeric
dyes is accounted for ( Jarosz-Wilkołazka et al., 2002; Mishra
and Maiti, 2018 ). Laccase, a multi-copper oxidase, is present in
many species of bacteria, fungi, insects, and higher plants.Together with all of them, laccase is signiﬁcantly produced by
fungi. Because of the huge number of organic compounds degra-
dation it can also reduce azo dyes signiﬁcantly. Fungal laccase
synthesis is affected by both carbon and nitrogen nutrients sup-
ply ( Liu et al., 2020 ).
Fungal process of azo dyes biodegradation is most effective and
economical as it is low cost and eco-friendly with less sludge pro-
duction. Mechanism of fungi decolorization occurs by adsorption,
enzymatic degradation or by both ( Yang et al., 2009 ). Extracellular
ligninolytic enzymes including the laccase, manganese and lignin
peroxidase are formed by fungi for degrading the complex organic
compounds. Industrial wastewater produces such chemicals which
harm plant growth. The microbes produced in these efﬂuents can
degrade azo dyes effectively. These microbes should be isolated,
because in developing countries like Pakistan the untreated water
is used for irrigation which is more hazardous for human health
(Shafqat et al., 2017 ).5.3. Azo dye degradation by plants
In recent studies the plant’s ability to degrade azo dyes has
gained much attention. As the untreated industrial water is
released in water bodies it poses many lethal effects on the liv-
ing organisms. So with other bioremediation processes plants
should also be utilized for this purpose. Plants can degrade
azo dyes as they can produce enzymes like lignin, peroxidases
and manganeses. The aerobic and anaerobic environment
needed for dye degradation is provided by roots in the rhizo-
sphere and plants can absorb the dye from wastewater whichcan help in wastewater decoloration ( Zhou and Xiang, 2013;
Goud et al., 2020 ).
The anaerobically produced aromatic amines are carcinogenic
and mutagenic in nature but they could be reduced under aerobicconditions. A combination of plants and microbes can facilitate this
process effectively. Azo dye, Methyl red, is treated by plant–mi-
crobe association resulting in up to 92 % effective decolorization
(Jayapal et al., 2018 ).
6. Recent and future work
The old or conventional ways of azo dye efﬂuents degradation
are not enough to get rid of this massive pollution created by these
toxic dyes. The conventional methods include the physical, chem-
ical and biological process which includes adsorption, ﬁltration
and coagulation ( Abramian and El-Rassy, 2009 ). Many factors of
dye i.e. pH, temperature and dye concentration itself limit the
application of these conventional methods ( Ince and Tezcanli-
Güyer, 2004 ). So, various recent techniques are now in use to
degrade these recalcitrant synthetic dyes ( Selvaraj et al., 2020 ).
In recent searches some studies presented the potential
of brown-rot fungi for different azo dyes removal ( Ali et al.,
2010 ).
For azo dye degradation some physical and chemical methods
have also been used including the reductive degradation, ozona-
tion, adsorption, electrochemical, photocatalysis and the Fenton
reaction. Some of these are explained as following.
a. Use of microbial fuel cells (MFCs).
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are used by many scientists in pre-
sent time for dye treatment with electricity generation. Various
factors like dye concentration, dye structure, microbial fuel cells
characteristics e.g. architecture, types of electrode, external resis-
tance, pH, hydraulic retention time (HRT), auxiliary carbon source,
composition of wastewater, and used microorganisms inﬂuence
the microbial fuel cells performance ( Pietruk et al., 2019 ). In MFCs,
an enzyme i.e. laccase which is signiﬁcantly produced by fungi can
be used with an air cathode as a catalyst in place of noble metal
(Oon et al., 2020 ).
b. Use of laccase.
In recent years, MFCs cathode has used laccase as a redox cata-
lyst. Traditional catalysts made of precious metals like gold and
platinum are replaced due to laccase strong redox properties. So,
laccase is signiﬁcantly used with an air cathode in MFCs ( Liu
et al., 2020 ).
c. Use of Fenton reaction.
Fenton is basically a low iron oxidation process for azo dye
degradation. It is the best technology combined with catalytic oxi-
dation process with mixture of ferrous ions (Fe
2+) and hydrogen
peroxide (H 2O2) which produces the strongest oxidant hydroxyl
radicals (/C1OH). These radicals are commonly used for a large num-
ber of pollutant degradation in biological systems. High levels of
H2O2are required for azo dye reduction ( Hsueh et al., 2005;
Purnomo et al., 2019; Zhuang et al., 2020 ).S. Zafar, D.A. Bukhari and A. Rehman Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences 29 (2022) 103437
5d. Use of Zero-Valent iron (ZVI).
For water decontamination, zero-valent iron (ZVI) is also
evolved. Sulﬁdation enhances the ZVI efﬁcacy by increasing its
reactivity towards its pollutants ( Zhang et al., 2019 ).e. Use of nano synthetics.
The feasible and quite effective way of azo dye removal was cre-
ated by synthesizing the Nickel (II) oxide nanoparticles. The more
advancing analytical techniques i.e. transmission electron micro-

6scopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray power diffraction,
selected area electron diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spec-
troscopy, elemental mapping analysis and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy are used to characterize it. By batch absorption
method the methyl orange dye is removed ( Baig et al., 2020;
Xiong et al., 2020 ). Likewise, palladium nanoparticles PdNPs with
high surface area and better catalytic activity are used in azo dye
reduction ( Xiong et al., 2020 ).
f. Use of aerobic-microaerophilic bacterial system.
It was proposed that A. hydrophila MTCC 1739 and L. sphaeri-
cus MTCC 9523 are good in their ability to decolorize and biode-
grade the textile wastewater azo dyes ( Srinivasan and Sadasivam,
2018 ). So, the modern method consisting of an in silico screening
and bacterial dye degradation is considered most effective for both
perspective i.e. economical and time effective ( Guo et al., 2020 ).
g. Use of oxidation.
Advanced oxidation process shows an effective result in recent
studies of removing wastewater efﬂuents. This oxidation removes
the organic pollutants from alkaline wastewater. For example, bet-
ter AO7 decolorization by CAP oxidation is reported in laboratoryexperiments ( Li et al., 2018; Muniyasamy et al., 2020 ).
h. Use of photocatalysts.
A photocatalyst consisting of two dimensional conductors as
organic semiconductor carbon nitride and inorganic semiconduc-
tor CdS, work as the light harvesting units and heterogeneous cat-
alyst. Both materials are the light active semiconductor. A
heterojunction catalyst forms having ability to remove dye upto
97 % ( Ayodele et al., 2021; Leeladevi et al., 2021 ). Methyl orange,
azo dye, is degraded by this method. A ZnO photocatalyst impreg-
nated on fungi is also used for azo dyes photocatalytic oxidation
(Bouras et al., 2019 ).
i. Use of corncob via biosorption.
During corn processing a huge amount of corn waste is gener-
ated. The biosorption process carried out with this corn waste
helps to reduce the dye wastes ( Berber-Villamar et al. 2018 ).
j. Use of modern bioﬁlms electrode reactors (BERs).
BERs are basically a combination of microorganisms with elec-
trochemistry. It can degrade azo dyes, nitro compounds and antibi-
otics ( Cui et al., 2017 ). It works by electrical supply at anode which
reduces the refractory substances (azo dyes having more than one
–N@N – bonds) at cathode ( Cao et al., 2018 ).
k. Use of catalytic.
Catalytic degradation of azo dyes in minimal media with least
energy consumption is a more efﬁcient way to deal with this
massive pollutant. A complete set of heterogeneous catalysts oxi-
dize azo dyes under less harsh conditions. Activated carbons, zeo-lites, clay minerals, ashes, alumina and silica are used as a
support in heterogeneous catalysts preparation ( Torres-Luna
et al., 2019 ).
7. Conclusions
From the available water sources the textile industry uses a
large portion and releases tons of wastewater with dangerous
efﬂuents every day. Azo dyes, the most famous and excessively
used chemicals in the textile industry, are now reaching alarming
concentration levels in our environment due to their massive
release outside directly. Many different approaches i.e. oxidation,
photocatalyst, bioadsorption and nanotechnology are used to elim-
inate these dyes from wastewater efﬂuents to prevent living organ-
isms. These methods are costly and are not suitable to use at low
azo dye concentration. Microbial use for dye polluted wastewater
treatment is often considered as an eco-friendly method instead
of conventional methods. Bacterial, yeast, and fungal capabilities
to reduce these dyes are being investigated. Mixtures of aerobic
and anaerobic bacteria are considered more efﬁcient to degrade
azo dyes. Microbial enzymes like lignin and azoreductase have
capacity to reduce azo dyes under aerobic and anaerobic condi-
tions. Now it is well understood that the microbial strains are very
helpful to reduce/degrade these toxic compounds into nontoxic
forms. So the microbial consortia, their processes and enzymes
are in use with other advancing technologies as an effective sus-
tainable strategy for azo dye decolorization and biodegradation,
indicating that bioremediation is an efﬁcient and sustainable
option for green chemistry to exterminate azo dyes from the
ecosystem.
