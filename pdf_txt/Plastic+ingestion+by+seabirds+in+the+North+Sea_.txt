INTRODUCTION
Plastic is a significant problem in all oceans of the world and 
accounts for up to 90% of marine debris (Derraik 2002, Rios et 
al. 2007, Barnes et al. 2009). It has well-documented impacts 
on a wide range of marine biota, primarily due to ingestion or entanglement (Laist 1997, Gregory 2009). Plastic ingestion by seabirds has increased significantly since the 1970s and parallels 
the increase in the amount and type of plastic in the world’s oceans 
(Robards et al. 1995, Ryan 2008). Furthermore, greater numbers 
of species now ingest plastic, and the frequency of occurrence of plastic within those species has also increased (Robards et al. 1995, 
van Franeker et al. 2011, Lavers et al. 2014). 
Seabirds in the order Procellariformes have some of the highest 
incidence of ingestion, with at least 80% of species reported to carry plastic loads (Robards et al. 1995, Ryan 2008, Acampora et 
al. 2014). Shearwaters Puffinus spp. are known to be particularly vulnerable (Vlietstra & Parga 2002) and in some species, e.g. Short-tailed P . tenuirostris and Flesh-footed P . carneipes shearwaters, 
the proportion of individuals ingesting plastic is reported to be 
80%–100% (Hutton et al. 2008, Carey 2011, Cousin et al. 2015). 
As wide-ranging foragers and marine predators, seabirds are also 
recognised as valuable bioindicators (Robards et al. 1997, Ryan 2008). Monitoring the incidence of ingestion and types of plastic 
ingested can provide a record of affected species and a basis for 
longer-term trends, as well as a cost-effective means to monitor plastic pollution levels in the ocean (Ryan et al. 2009, Tourinho et 
al. 2010). Ingestion of plastic in seabirds and its effects are well documented, particularly in waters of the Northern Hemisphere and around South America (e.g. Ryan 1990, Copello & Quintana 2003, van Franeker et al. 2011, Yamashita et al. 2011). Fewer data exist 
for Australian waters or the southwestern Pacific (Spear et al. 1995, 
Carey 2011), and there appears to be no information on plastic 
ingestion in coastal bird species in Australian waters. 
This paper examines the incidence of plastic ingestion, and the 
type and amount of plastic ingested, in a variety of the seabird 
and coastal bird species of southeastern Australia. Relationships between ingestion and a number of factors that may influence it, such as species, diet and migration pattern, were also considered.
METHODS
A sample of 30 birds — 11 species representing seven families 
and four orders (following Christidis & Boles 2008) (Table 1) — 
were examined. Samples were sourced from Australian Seabird 
Rescue (ASR), a WildlifeLink seabird and marine turtle rescue and rehabilitation organisation located in Ballina (28°84′S, 153°57′E) in northern New South Wales (NSW) on the east coast of Australia. 
Birds were found stranded (as a result of injury, illness or exhaustion) 
in various locations between Wooli (29°37′S, 153°29′E) and New Brighton (28°51′S, 153°55′E) and were brought into care at ASR but subsequently died. A variety of different species was chosen in order to identify whether plastic ingestion was prevalent in resident 
coastal species (e.g. Phalacrocoracidae and Charadriiformes) as 
well as in migratory species (e.g. Procellariformes) found on the north coast of NSW. While the sample size is small, it is novel in its inclusion of marine and coastal species, as well as migratory and PLASTIC INGESTION IN MARINE AND COASTAL BIRD SPECIES

SUMMARY
Gilbert, J.M., Reichelt-Brushett, A.J., Bowling, A.C., Christidis, L. 2016. Plastic ingestion in marine and coastal bird species of southeastern 
Australia. Marine Ornithology 44: 21–26.
Plastic pollution is a significant problem in all oceans of the world and accounts for up to 90% of marine debris. Ingestion of plastic by 
seabirds and its effects are well documented, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. However, fewer data exist for levels of plastic in seabird and coastal bird species in Australian waters or the southwestern Pacific. In this study, the stomach contents of a variety of seabirds and coastal birds (migratory and resident) were analysed for plastic. Nine (30%) of the birds sampled contained plastic. The median mass 
of plastic per bird was 41.7 mg and median number of pieces was 3.0. Shearwaters Puffinus spp. had significantly higher plastic mass and 
number of pieces than other species, and the most common type of plastic was manufactured. However, industrial pellets also contributed substantially. Plastics were primarily dark in colour. No clear indication of the influence of plastic ingestion on body condition could be found, however, internal physical damage and intestinal blockage was noted. Further assessment of the incidence and the effects of plastic ingestion in seabird and coastal bird species in Australian waters is required.

resident birds found along the east coast of Australia. Samples were 
obtained from ASR over a period of 13 months (July 2011–August 2012) and kept frozen at -25 °C until necropsies were performed in 
August 2012. 
Before necropsy, birds were thawed at room temperature, dried 
and weighed on an electronic balance (SECA, Chino USA); 
the beak and tarsus length were recorded for each individual. 
Necropsies were performed using general guidelines from Butcher & Miles (1993). Briefly, carcasses were plucked and dissected along the anteroposterior axis between the cloaca and the beak. Internal organs and anatomy were examined for haemorrhaging 
or other signs of internal trauma, which were recorded; where 
appropriate, samples were taken. Contents of the gizzard and proventriculus were examined for the presence of plastic or other foreign matter, and biological contents such as prey remains, grit 
or pebble fragments and parasites were also recorded (Auman et 
al. 1997, Carey 2011). Plastic items were removed, and the gizzard and proventriculus were examined for perforations, lacerations, ulceration or haemorrhage. Plastics were washed in Milli-Q ultra-pure water and dried in a fume hood. Items were counted, 
weighed on an AB204-S digital balance (± 0.1 mg), and classified 
by colour and type (industrial pellets or manufactured fragments) (Blight & Burger 1997, Ryan 2008), and size (according to Barnes et al. 2009). Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 
version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, US). Because of the small 
sample size and the skewed distribution of the data, non-parametric statistical tests were applied. Mann–Whitney U tests were used to investigate differences in debris weight and number 
of pieces between species (shearwater and other), age classes 
(juvenile/adult, determined by plumage) and migration pattern (pairwise comparisons, trans-Pacific and equatorial/non-migrant). Correlations were used to investigate relationships between bird mass and plastic mass, and between bird mass and number 
of pieces. Given the use of non-parametric tests, medians are 
reported. “Incidence” is defined as a percentage of the total, i.e. for individuals of a species or group that contained plastic, and for types of plastic. 
RESULTS
Overall, this study found that 10 of the 30 birds (33%) carried 
debris loads, with nine carrying plastic debris (30%). In total, 
50 items were collected from 10 birds, 49 of which were plastic 
and one of which was metal. The metal item consisted of a gang hook (two hooks with attached metal tracer line, total weight 3.13 g), which had been ingested by a juvenile Australian Gannet

Morus serrator. This metal debris was excluded from analysis 
of data relating to plastic ingestion. The size of most plastic items recovered, from visual observation (single observer), were 
categorised as micro (<5 mm), with only a small number of meso-
sized items (5–20 mm). For the nine birds that carried plastic debris, the median number of plastic items per bird was 3.0 and median weight of plastic per bird was 41.7  mg (range 1.4–290.2  mg). 
However, it should be noted that 33% of birds carrying plastic 
carried >100  mg (median  =  75.7  mg, range 164.8–290.2). The highest number of plastic items recorded in one sample was 12, and the greatest mass of plastic was 290.2 mg, both from Short-tailed Shearwaters. Four of the five Short-tailed Shearwaters had ingested 
plastic, with loads ranging from 48.2 mg to 290 mg, whereas, of the 
two Wedge-tailed Shearwaters P . pacificus, only one had ingested 
plastic and the load was much lower (27.5 mg) (Table 2). Overall, Short-tailed Shearwaters tended to carry more plastic than Wedge-
tailed Shearwaters, but these differences were not significant. There 
were no significant correlations between bird mass and plastic mass (r = -0.19, P > 0.05) or bird mass and number of plastic items 
(r = 0.19, P > 0.05).
Shearwaters accounted for 67% of all birds that had ingested plastic, 
and they had ingested the highest number of pieces (35). Incidence of plastic ingestion was significantly higher in shearwaters (n  =  9) compared with other species (n = 20) (67% and 15%, respectively, 
U  =  43.5, P  =  0.006), as was debris weight (106.5 and 9.1  mg, 
respectively; U  = 37.5, P  = 0.003) and total number of pieces (35 and 
14, respectively, U  = 41.5, P  = 0.005). There were also significant 
differences between trans-Pacific migrants and non-migrants in 
incidence of plastic ingestion (67% and 18%, respectively, U  = 33.0,  
P = 0.03), debris weight (170.2 and 5.6 mg, respectively; U  = 25.0,  
P = 0.006), and number of pieces (8.0 and 2.5, respectively; U  = 28.0,  
P =  0.01) but not between trans-Pacific and equatorial migrants 
(Fig. 1). There were no significant differences in incidence of plastic 
ingestion, debris weight or number of pieces between age classes 
(juvenile/adult, P   >  0.05 in all cases) or foraging method (diver/
surface, P  > 0.05 in all cases).
Plastic debris consisted of more fragments (including nylon 
fishing line remnants) than industrial pellets (60%, 31 pieces and 35%, 18  pieces, respectively), but the difference was not 
significant. Plastic fragments predominantly consisted of hard plastics degraded from larger items and some pieces of nylon 
line. Pellets made a noteworthy contribution to the total amount 
of plastic, with all four of the Short-tailed Shearwaters found to have ingested the same type of black coiled pellets; in two of the samples, the pellets were more highly degraded (Fig. 2). 
The colour of items ingested was predominantly black (67%) 
with dark colours (black, brown) accounting for 69% of items. The remaining 31% were of lighter colours (white, yellow and light blue). 
Most plastic items were found in the gizzard (89%), with the 
exception of a piece of nylon line that was found in the small intestine of a prion (Pachyptila spp.). Three samples (33%) had plastic items completely blocking the pylorus (two Short-tailed 
and one Wedge-tailed shearwater), and ulceration and necrosis 
of the gizzard was evident in six of the nine samples that carried plastic (66%). With the exception of the two Australasian Darters Anhinga novahollandiae and two Silver Gulls Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae, all other birds were emaciated and most were less 
than half average normal weight (V ogelnest 2000). Only two birds 
(both Silver Gulls) had fat reserves. Few had any stomach contents apart from squid beaks, fish scales or other unidentified prey remains. Shellgrit and small pebbles were also relatively common, 
as was the presence of round and tapeworms. 
DISCUSSIONWhile caution is required in interpreting results, given the small 
sample size and the variance in the data, we can report that plastic 
ingestion is prevalent in Australia’s pelagic migratory seabird species, and also that ingestion is apparent in resident coastal species. The overall percentage of birds carrying plastic debris 
(30%) was lower than reported in other regional studies in eastern 
Australia (Hutton et al. 2008, Carey 2011, Acampora et al. 2013, Cousin et al. 2015). This is likely due to inclusion in the present 
study of coastal and near-shore species, which constituted over half of the samples (18 individuals). The results are, however, consistent 
with other studies that also included coastal and resident species, all 
of which reported lower overall incidence of plastic ingestion, with results between 11% and 40% (Ainley et al. 1989, Spear et al. 1995, Tourinho et al. 2010). 
High incidence of plastic ingestion, and greater mass and number of items in shearwaters than in other species, has also been

reported previously (Ainley et al. 1989, Spear et al. 1995, Ryan 
2008, Tourinho et al. 2010). These studies also found low, or no, 
incidence of plastic ingestion in Charadriiformes or Phaethontidae 
(where the latter family was included), and suggested that 
differences in physiology may influence results. Shearwaters have a unique proventriculus, which restricts regurgitation of indigestible items (Furness 1985, Carey 2011, Acampora et 
al. 2014), and the absence of this in coastal species may 
help to explain the significant differences (Ainley et al. 1989, Tourinho et al. 2010). No other account of plastic ingestion in 
Phalacrocoracidae could be found. 
Differences between other species and shearwaters could also be 
interpreted as a reflection of the different diets between the two groups. Azzarello & Van Vleet (1987) found that piscivores were less likely to ingest plastic, and Ryan (2008) suggested that more 
opportunistic foragers were unlikely to be very selective and, 
therefore, may be more prone to ingesting plastic inadvertently. The prey of shearwaters is composed of euphausiids, cephalopods, crustaceans and, to a lesser degree, small schooling fish (Lindsey 1986, Skira 1986), suggesting they are more opportunistic than 
coastal species such as the Australasian Darter and the Pied 
Cormorant Phalacrocorax varius, which are primarily piscivorous 
(Lindsey 1986). 
Another explanation for the differences could be related to 
migration pattern (Ainley et al. 1989, Ryan 1990, Spear et al.  
1995, Vlietstra & Parga 2002). As trans-Pacific migrants, Short-tailed Shearwaters cover vast areas of the Pacific Ocean during migration, and they are also known to forage at some distance 
from breeding colonies when resident (McDuie et al. 2015), 
crossing oceanic fronts in the process (Lindsey 1986, Skira 1986). Skira (1986), Ainley et al. (1989), Spear et al. (1995) and Vlietstra 
& Parga (2002), who compared longer-term data, noticed seasonal 
variations in the type and amount of plastic ingested, particularly 
in species with longer migration patterns. Specifically, Ainley et al. (1989) and Spear et al. (1995) found a higher incidence of 
ingestion in species that bred in the South Pacific and wintered in the North Pacific, and foraged at oceanic fronts or convergences, 
such as the Short-tailed Shearwaters in the present study. In 
contrast, non-migrant species, particularly in regional coastal areas where samples for the present study were collected, would have considerably less exposure to sources of plastic debris 
(Reisser et al. 2013). 
The composition of plastic debris and predominance of plastic 
fragments found in birds in the present study have been reported in numerous other studies worldwide (e.g. Ryan 2008, Tourinho 
et al. 2010, Carey 2011). Surveys of plastic debris in Australian 
marine waters (Hardesty & Wilcox 2011, Reisser et al. 2013) 
also report the predominance of fragments from larger consumer items and of micro-plastics. Notably, the colour of debris found 
ingested in the present study (predominantly dark or black) 
was somewhat different from that reported elsewhere, with numerous studies reporting a predominance of light or bright colours (e.g. Vlietstra & Parga 2002, Carey 2011, Lavers et al.  
2014, Cousin et al. 2015). Acampora et al. (2013), however, 
noted that Short-tailed Shearwaters in their study, which were adults on their southern migration, had consumed primarily dark- and clear-coloured plastics. This may help to explain the predominance of black fragments in samples from Short-tailed 
Shearwaters in this study, all of which were considered adults according to plumage and morphometrics (V ogelnest 2000). Ryan 
(2008) also reported that seabirds appeared to “prefer” darker or more conspicuously coloured debris. Alternatively, as Day 
(1980) suggested, shearwaters may show no colour preference, 
and ingestion of different colours may be a result of regional distribution patterns of plastic debris, or starving birds in poor body condition may be more likely to take anything (Day 1980). 
The lack of a correlation between bird mass and plastic mass or 
number of items in the present study is notable, and has been regularly reported (Ainley et al. 1989, Robards et al. 1995, Ryan 2008), particularly in Short-tailed Shearwaters (Yamashita et al.  
2011, Acampora et al. 2014, Cousin et al. 2015). While some 
authors have reported significant negative relationships in various species (Spear et al., 1995, Auman et al., 1997, and Vlietstra 
& Parga 2002, Lavers et al., 2014), these are relatively rarely 
reported findings. As Vlietstra & Parga (2002) suggest, if plastic 
does have an adverse effect on body condition, then species that frequently ingest plastic should be the most likely to show negative effects on body condition, including reduced foraging success or starvation. 
The general absence of this relationship has been a stumbling 
block in finding evidence for direct or indirect effects of plastic ingestion on body condition (Ryan 1990, Robards et al. 1995, 
Hutton et al. 2008, Carey 2011). As Ryan (1990) and others 
(Auman et al. 1997, Hutton et al. 2008) point out, there is the 
question of which is cause and which effect? Is the bird in poor condition due to plastic ingestion, or has starvation made it less discriminating and therefore more prone to plastic ingestion 
during foraging? In the case of stranded birds, has ingestion of 
plastic affected the ability to endure adverse weather and other conditions or, again, has starvation prompted indiscriminate ingestion of more plastic (Ryan 1990, Gregory 2009)? In the 
present study, all but two of the birds were classified as being 
in poor condition, but this could be considered an artefact,  
given that birds come into care at ASR generally because they  
are in poor condition.
Given the increasing amount of plastic and other debris in the 
oceans, and coastal and seabirds’ reliance on marine ecosystems, they are likely to encounter marine debris throughout their lives. This makes them vulnerable to chronic effects from plastic 
accumulated over the long term (Ryan 1988, Colabuono et al.  
2010, Rochman et al. 2013) and may add considerable stress to 
individuals (Ryan 1990, Vlietstra and Parga 2002), particularly if they are unable to successfully regurgitate all foreign matter (Ryan 1990, Mallory et al. 2006, Tourinho et al. 2010, Carey 
2011). V ogelnest (2000) observed that this long-term exposure may have serious consequences for bird populations over time, however, a gradual decline in numbers may go unnoticed.
