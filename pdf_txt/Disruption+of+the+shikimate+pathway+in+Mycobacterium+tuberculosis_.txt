Abstract
Background: The emergence of multi- and extensively-drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains
has created an urgent need for new agents to treat tuberculosis (TB). The enzymes of shikimate pathway
are attractive targets to the de velopment of antituberc ular agents because it is essential for M. tuberculosis
and is absent from humans. Chorismate synthase (CS)  is the seventh enzyme of  this route and catalyzes
the NADH- and FMN-dependent synthesis of chor ismate, a precursor of aromatic amino acids,
naphthoquinones, menaquinones, and mycobactins. Although the M. tuberculosis Rv2540c ( aroF) sequence
has been annotated to encode a ch orismate synthase, there has been no report on its correct assignment
and functional characterization of its protein product.
Results: In the present work, we describe DNA amplification of aroF-encoded CS from M. tuberculosis
(MtCS), molecular cloning, protein e xpression, and purification to ho mogeneity. N-terminal amino acid
sequencing, mass spectrometry and gel filtration chromatography were  employed to determine identity,
subunit molecular weight and oligomeric stat e in solution of homogeneous recombinant MtCS. The
bifunctionality of MtCS was determined by measurements of both chorismate synthase and NADH:FMN
oxidoreductase activities. The flav in reductase activity was characte rized, showing the existence of a
complex between FMNox and MtCS. FMNox and NADH equilibrium binding was measured. Primary
deuterium, solvent and multiple kinetic isotope effects  are described and suggest distinct steps for hydride
and proton transfers, with the former being more rate-limiting.
Conclusion: This is the first report showing that a bacterial  CS is bifunctional. Pr imary deuterium kinetic
isotope effects show that C4-proS hydrogen is being transferred during the reduction of FMNox by NADH
and that hydride transfer contributes significantly to  the rate-limiting step of FMN reduction reaction.
Solvent kinetic isotope effects and pr oton inventory results indicate th at proton transfer from solvent
partially limits the rate of FMN reduction and that a single prot on transfer gives rise to the observed
solvent isotope effect. Multiple isotope effects sugge st a stepwise mechanism for the reduction of FMNox.
The results on enzyme kinetics described here provide evidence for the mode of action of MtCS and
should thus pave the way for the ration al design of antitubercular agents.Published: 29 April 2008

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health concern.
Its causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis , has been
estimated to infect approximately one-third of the world's
population [1], and approximately 30 million people
have died from the disease in the past decade [2]. The
World Health Organization estimated a total of 9 million
new cases of TB and approximately 2 million deaths from
this disease in 2004, second only to AIDS among infec-
tious diseases [3]. The emergence of drug resistant isolates
of M. tuberculosis , particularly of multi drug-resistant TB
(MDR-TB), defined as resistant to at least isoniazid and
rifampicin [4], imposes a great challenge to public health
[5]. Treatment of MDR-TB requires the administration of
second-line drugs that are more toxic and less effective [6].
More recently, it was reported cases of extensively drug-
resistant (XDR) TB, which are defined as cases in persons
with TB whose isolates were resistant to isoniazid and
rifampicin and at least three of the six main classes of sec-
ond-line drugs (aminoglycosides, polypeptides, fluoro-
quinolones, thioamides, cycloserine, and para-
aminosalicylic acid) [7]. XDR-TB has a wide geographic
distribution and it raises the bleak prospect of a future epi-
demic of virtually untreatable TB. New antimycobacterial
agents are thus needed to improve the treatment of MDR-
and XDR-TB, to shorten the treatment course and increase
patient compliance, and to provide more effective treat-
ment of latent TB infection.
A valuable approach to the development of selective anti-
microbial chemotherapy is to exploit the inhibition of tar-
gets unique and vital to the pathogen [8]. The enzymes of
the shikimate pathway are attractive examples of these tar-
gets because this route is essential in higher plants, fungi,
bacteria and algae and is absent in mammals [9,10]. In M.
tuberculosis , the shikimate pathway leads to the biosynthe-
sis of a wide range of primary and secondary metabolites,
including aromatic amino acids, folate, naphthoqui-
nones, menaquinones and mycobactins [11]. Disruption
of aroK-encoding shikimate kinase gene has recently
shown that the shikimate pathway is essential for M.
tuberculosis viability [12], which establishes the enzymes
of this pathway as potential targets for the development of
new antimycobacterial agents.
Homologues to the shikimate pathway enzymes were
identified in the complete genome sequence of M. tuber-
culosis H37Rv [13]. Among them, chorismate synthase
(CS; EC 4.2.3.5; 5- O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshiki-
mate phosphate lyase) encoding gene ( aroF, Rv2540c)
was proposed to be present by sequence homology. CS
catalyzes an unusual 1,4- anti-elimination of the 3-phos-
phate group and the C-(6 proR) hydrogen from 5-
enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) forming chor-
ismate and phosphate [14]. Although there is no overallchange in its redox state, there is an absolute requirement
for a reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNred) [15,16].
Another interesting feature of CSs from different organ-
isms is how reduced FMNred is obtained, which divides
these enzymes into two classes: monofunctional and
bifunctional [17]. The CSs from fungi are bifunctional as
they display a second enzymatic activity (Figure 1), an
NAD(P)H-dependent (dependent of reduced form of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) flavin reductase
(described as "diaphorase" activity in a number of
papers), which confers them an intrinsic ability to reduce
flavin using NAD(P)H [18]. The CSs from plants and
Escherichia coli are monofunctional as they do not possess
this activity and are active only in anaerobic conditions in
the presence of either chemically or enzymatically
reduced flavin [16]. However, there has been no report on
both confirmation of the correct assignment of Rv2540c
(aroF) as the M. tuberculosis chorismate synthase ( MtCS)
coding sequence and functional characterization of its
protein product. Moreover, there has been no report on
whether MtCS is bifunctional or monofunctional.
Here we report the amplification and cloning of Rv2540c
DNA sequence (putative aroF gene) from M. tuberculosis ,
and heterologous overexpression of the MtCS protein. The
recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity using a
three-step purification protocol and its identity was con-
firmed by N-terminal sequencing, and electrospray ioni-
zation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The oligomeric state
of MtCS was determined by gel filtration. We also show
that CS from M. tuberculosis is bifunctional, as in fungi,
based on activity measurements of both chorismate syn-
thase and NADH-dependent flavin reductase activities.
Moreover, FMN appears to be bound to MtCS based on
ionic exchange chromatography, and FMNox (oxidized fla-
vin mononucleotide) and NADH binding to MtCS were
assessed by spectroscopic measurements at equilibrium.
The apparent kinetic constants for the holoenzyme MtCS-
FMNox for NADH were determined. The NADH-depend-
ent flavin reductase activity was characterized by isotope
effects. Measurements of primary deuterium and solvent
kinetic isotope effects were carried out to probe the nature
of the rate-limiting step of the redox reaction. Multiple
isotope effects were also determined showing that a step-
wise mechanism is involved in this reaction. Proton
inventory on the maximal velocity allowed us to address
the number of kinetically important transferred protons.
The results presented here are important to understand
the reaction mechanism of this enzyme, which should
pave the way for the rational-based design of MtCS inhib-
itors with potential antitubercular activity and low toxic-
ity.BMC Biochemistry  2008, 9:13 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/13

Molecular cloning, expressi on, and purification of MtCS
PCR amplification of Rv2540c DNA sequence (putative
aroF gene) from genomic M. tuberculosis DNA yielded a
fragment with the expected length (1206 bp). The frag-
ment was cloned into pET23a(+) expression vector, and
the aroF gene was sequenced, which confirmed its identity
and the absence of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)-
introduced mutations. A number of E. coli host strains
were employed to express MtCS, including BL21(DE3),
Origami(DE3), and BL21 trxB(DE3), but no expression
could be obtained. Different cultivating temperatures
(25°, 30° and 37°C) and presence or absence of isopro-
pyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) were also employed to no
avail (data not shown). MtCS overexpression could only
be achieved in E. coli Rosetta(DE3) host cells, which pro-
vide tRNAs for codons that are rarely used by E. coli . In
agreement, ten rare codons were identified on M. tubercu-
losis aroF sequence (7 × CCC, AUA, CUA, GGA). Sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-
PAGE) analysis revealed a cell extract containing a signifi-
cant amount of a soluble protein with an apparent molec-
ular weight in agreement with the predicted value based
on amino acid sequence for MtCS (41.8 kDa) (Figure 2A).Interestingly, recombinant protein expression was
achieved in E. coli Rosetta(DE3) host cells grown for 24 h
at 37°C in the absence of IPTG induction. It has been pre-
viously shown that the lac-controlled systems, including
the pET system, could have a high-level protein expres-
sion, in the absence of inducer. This phenomenon occurs
in the cell stationary phase, when there is the presence of
a complex medium, cyclic AMP, acetate and low pH [19].
Recently, another shikimate pathway enzyme from M.
tuberculosis , 3-Deoxy-D- arabino -heptulosonate 7-phos-
phate (DAHP) synthase, was reported to be expressed
only in the absence of IPTG [20]. The three-step purifica-
tion protocol yielded approximately 55 mg of MtCS from
6 liters of cell culture. No other protein can be observed
on SDS-PAGE, which indicates the high level of MtCS
purity (Figure 2B). The MtCS activity before the purifica-
tion can hardly be measured, probably due to interfering
compounds, and thus only the amount of total recom-
binant protein could be assessed. The ammonium sulfate
precipitation of purified MtCS resulted in total inactiva-
tion of the enzyme (data not shown). Homogeneous
recombinant protein was thus instantaneously frozen in
liquid nitrogen in the absence of ammonium sulfate,
which proved to be a convenient protocol for active
homogeneous recombinant MtCS protein storage.Reactions catalysed by bifunctional CSsFigure 1

(page number not for citation purposes)Analysis of purified MtCS
The ESI-MS of homogeneous MtCS revealed a subunit
molecular mass of 41,804 Da, consistent with the theoret-
ical molecular mass (41,792 Da). The first 16 N-terminal
amino acid residues were identified as MLRWITAGESH-
GRALV, which confirmed the identity of homogeneous
MtCS and presence of N-terminal methionine residue.
Analytical gel filtration chromatography revealed a single
peak of approximately 104 kDa, suggesting that MtCS is a
dimer in solution, which is in agreement with the hydro-
dynamic properties of the recombinant protein assessed
by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium
[18].
The CS activity of MtCS
The synthesis of EPSP was carried out in a vial containing
the enzymes MtSK and MtEPSPS, which convert shiki-
mate, ATP and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to 5-
enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP), ADP and Pi.
The equilibrium of the forward reaction was displaced
using Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (PNP), which
consumes Pi, increasing the final concentration of EPSP in
the reaction mixture. The enzymes were removed by ultra-
filtration to avoid any residual MtEPSPS enzyme activity
that could release Pi in solution, which would thus inter-
fere with specific measurements of MtCS enzyme activity.
Conversion of EPSP to chorismate and Pi catalyzed by
MtCS enzyme activity (Figure 1) was determined by meas-
uring the release of Pi using PNP, which converts 2-
amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside
(MESG) and Pi to ribose-1-phosphate and 7-methyl-6-
thio-guanine base, monitoring absorbance of the latter at
360 nm. The enzymatic activity of homogenous MtCS was
dependent on enzyme volume added to the reaction mix-
ture (data not shown), showing that the initial velocity is
proportional to total enzyme concentration and that true
initial velocities are being measured. The conversion of
EPSP to chorismate in aerobic conditions by the addition
of FMNox and NADH is the first solid evidence that MtCS
is bifunctional, since the monofunctional CSs can only be
assayed under strictly anaerobic conditions in the pres-
ence of chemically or enzymatically reduced flavin [16].
The specific activity of bifunctional MtCS (0.004 U.mg-1)
is approximately 175-fold lower than the specific activity
of bifunctional Neurospora crassa CS (NcCS; 0.7 U.mg-1)
[21]. In the presence of oxygen the CS activity is limited by
the reoxidation of FMNred cofactor; but in bifunctional
CSs, NAD(P)H is used in consecutive cycles to maintain
the FMN in its reduced form (Figure 1). Moreover, the
structures of CS complexed with FMN from Helicobacter
pylori [22] and Streptococcus pneumoniae [23] have shown
that there are a number of positively charged amino acids
in the FMN binding pocket, which could increase the
reduction potential of FMNox/FMNred couple, likely per-
mitting the decrease of the rate of reoxidation. Indeed, inbifunctional NcCS the redox potential of the couple FMN-
red/FMNox was determined to be -167 mV, i.e. 40 mV more
positive than that of the free couple in solution (-207 mV)
[24].
The NADH:FMN-oxidoredu ctase activity of MtCS
The NADH-dependent reduction of FMNox was measured
in the forward reaction monitoring the decrease in NADH
concentration. The NADH:FMN-oxidoreductase activity
of homogenous MtCS is dependent on the enzyme vol-
ume added to the reaction mixture; therefore the initial
velocity is proportional to total enzyme concentration,
and true initial velocities are being measured. To verify the
stability of the MtCS-FMNox complex, MtCS was incu-
bated with excess FMNox and loaded on an anion
exchange column. Two peaks were observed and collected
into separated fractions measuring absorbance at 280 nm
and 445 nm, and pooled (Figure 3). To roughly estimate
the presence of protein in the two pools, coomassie-blue
was added to them and only the second pool was shown
to contain protein (indicating presence of recombinant
MtCS), while the first was not stained (indicating absence
of recombinant MtCS). The UV-Vis spectrum for the sec-
ond pool containing recombinant MtCS protein showed
that all the characteristic absorbance peaks of FMNox (267,
373, and 445 nm) could be observed (Figure 3 inset).
These results suggest that MtCS and FMNox form a stable
binary complex.
Although the FMNox usually appears as a prosthetic group
in NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductases from other organisms
[25], it was not clear whether in MtCS the FMN is cova-
lently bound. CSs from other organisms, such as that from
E. coli , showed low affinity for FMNox; but the value of Kd
for FMNox depends strongly on EPSP binding, decreasing
ca. 1000-fold in the presence of this substrate (from 30
µM to 20 nM) [26]. On the other hand, EPSP has a much
smaller effect on the affinity of bifunctional NcCS to
FMNox [21]. Interestingly, the purified MtCS is FMN-free,
which could be an effect of the insufficient intracellular
concentration of FMN, probably due to MtCS overexpres-
sion into the host cell. As described below, FMN appears
to have a value lower than 20 µM for the overall dissocia-
tion constant for MtCS-FMN binary complex formation at
equilibrium. Accordingly, it appears to be more likely that
FMN is lost during the protein purification protocol
because of a rather weak affinity of MtCS for FMN.
Accordingly, the kinetic data were collected considering
the holoenzyme as the MtCS-FMNox complex brought
about by incubating MtCS and near-saturating FMNox
concentration.
The oxidoreductase activity is functionally independent of
CS activity, since the consumption of NADH occurs in the
absence of EPSP. Considering the low specific activity ofBMC Biochemistry  2008, 9:13 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/13
Page 6 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)NADH:FMN-oxidoreductase in MtCS, all measurements
were made in triplicate, including the controls. Accord-
ingly, the apparent kinetic parameters for the oxidoreduct-
ase activity were determined in the absence of EPSP in
steady-state kinetic experiments. No activity was observed
when NADPH was used at concentrations ranging from
100 to 500 µM (data not shown). Kinetics of reduction of
the MtCS-bound FMNox by NADH was determined using
fixed amount of holoenzyme and varying levels of NADH
(Figure 4). The data were fitted to equation 1, and yielded
the following values: KNADH = 36 ± 4 µM, kcat = 8.3 (± 0.3)
× 10-3 s-1 and kcat/KNADH = 231 M-1 s-1. The KNADH observed
for MtCS is similar to the KNADPH determined for NcCS
[24] and ScCS [27] (43 µM and 70 µM, respectively). In
other NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductases (EC 1.5.1.30),
which are present in various organisms, the apparentkinetic constants show significant variation. For instance,
the KNAD(P)H can vary from 208 µM in Rhodococcus erythrop-
olis [28] to 0.85 µM in Bacillus subtilis [29].
Equilibrium measurements of FMNox and NADH binding to 
MtCS
The binding of FMNox to MtCS was assessed by UV-visible
difference spectra as described by Kitzing et al. [21]. The
observed spectral changes are characterized by hypochro-
mic effects on the flavin absorbance at both 378 nm and
450 nm up to 20 µM FMNox (Figure 5). At FMNox concen-
trations larger than 30 µM there is a hyperchromic effect
that is probably due to free oxidized FMN in solution (Fig-
ure 5 – inset). The spectral changes at low FMNox concen-
trations yielded low values for the difference spectra and
thus no reliable data could be obtained at concentrationsElution profile of incubated MtCS and FMNox, and UV-Vis spectrum sh owing stable binary complex formation Figure 3

(page number not for citation purposes)lower than 10 µM. Accordingly, the data presented here
allow only to estimate an upper limit value of 20 µM for
the FMNox equilibrium dissociation constant. We have
also tried to determine the dissociation constant of FMNox
from protein fluorescence titration as recently described
by Broco et al [30], which could allow reliable measure-
ment of oxidized FMN binding to MtCS at low concentra-
tions of FMNox. However, there was no quench/
enhancement in protein fluorescence upon FMNox bind-
ing to MtCS (data not shown). At any rate, the UV-visible
difference spectra show MtCS-FMNox binary complex for-
mation.The equilibrium binding of NADH to MtCS was assessed
by fluorescence spectroscopy. There is a quench in protein
fluorescence upon NADH binding to MtCS (Figure 6 –
inset). A titration curve showing the quench in protein
fluorescence upon the binding of NADH to MtCS is given
in Figure 6. The data were fitted to a hyperbolic equation
yielding a dissociation constant value of 156 ± 12 µM.
Even though the NADH-binding site remains unknown,
the results presented here clearly indicate that there is
indeed an NADH binding site on MtCS enzyme.Determination of steady-s tate kinetic parameters Figure 4

(page number not for citation purposes)Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects
To probe for rate-limiting steps and determine the stere-
ospecificity of hydride transfer, primary deuterium kinetic
isotope effects were determined. Initial velocity data were
collected using either [4 S-1H]NADH or [4 S-2H]NADH
(Figure 7), and values of 3.5 ± 0.2 and 3.0 ± 0.4 were
determined for, respectively, DV and DV/K. The magnitude
of the primary isotope effects when the [4 S-2H]NADH
substrate is used indicates that C4-proS hydrogen is being
transferred during the reduction of FMNox catalyzed by
MtCS. Isotope effects on V are related to events following
the formation of the complex capable of undergoing catal-
ysis ( MtCS-FMNox-NADH in the case studied here),
including chemical steps, possible enzyme conforma-
tional changes, and product release. Isotope effects on V/
K report on steps in the reaction mechanism from the
binding of the labeled substrate to the first irreversiblestep, usually product release [31]. The values for primary
deuterium isotope effects of biochemical interest usually
range from 3 to 7 [32], and steps such as conformational
changes accompanying hydride transfer and product
release may account for the lower values. In particular, pri-
mary deuterium kinetic isotope effects typically range
from 1 to 3 for enzyme reactions involving NAD(P)H oxi-
dation [33]. The DV value obtained for MtCS-FMNox (3.5)
suggests that the hydride transfer contributes significantly
to the rate-limiting step of the FMN reduction reaction.
The value of 3.0 for the DV/K indicates that NADH is not
sticky, since DV/K values for sticky substrates are around
unity [34]. It should be remembered that a substrate is
sticky if it reacts to give products as fast as, or faster than,
it dissociates from the enzyme. The stickiness of a sub-
strate depends on the external part of its commitment: theUV-visible difference spectroscopyFigure 5

Solvent isotope effects and proton inventory
Solvent isotope effects were employed to assess the contri-
bution of solvent proton transfer to the rate of flavin
reduction. Initial velocity data were collected in either
H2O or 91 atom % D2O (Figure 8), and values of 1.7 ± 0.3
and 1.3 ± 0.1 were obtained for D2OV and D2OV/K, respec-
tively. The magnitude of the solvent isotope effects indi-
cate that proton transfer partially limit the rate of FMNreduction reaction. In order to determine the number of
kinetically important protons transferred during the reac-
tion, a proton inventory on V was carried out. The mole
fraction of D2O was varied from 0 to 80%, and a linear
relationship between V and the mole fraction of D2O was
observed (Figure 8, inset). This result indicates that a sin-
gle proton transfer gives rise to the observed solvent iso-
tope effect [35].Equilibrium binding of NADH to MtCS assessed by monitoring the protein fl uorescence quench upon binary complex forma- tionFigure 6
Equilibrium binding of NADH to MtCS assessed by monitoring the protein fluorescence quench upon binary 
complex formation . The binding of NADH to MtCS causes a quench in protein fluorescence ( λexc = 290 nm; 310 ≤ λem ≤ 
510 nm; with a maximum at 345.5 nm). The MtCS enzyme solution (1 µM) was titrated with incr easing concentrations of 
NADH, and the data points (fluorescence inte nsities at 345.5 nm) were fitted to a hype rbolic equation (solid line). Inset: Emis -
sion spectra of free MtCS (1 µM) and enzyme in the presence of 80 µM NADH. Emission spectrum of free enzyme shows a 
peak at 345.5 nm and no emission at  ~450 nm. Emission spectrum of MtCS in the presence of NADH shows a quench in pro-
tein fluorescence concomitant to an increa se in nucleotide fluorescence at ~450 nm.

(page number not for citation purposes)Multiple isotope effects
Significantly different magnitudes between primary and
solvent kinetic isotope effects may indicate that they are
reporting on distinct steps of a reaction, as reported for the
NADPH-dependent ketoacyl-ACP reductase from S. pneu-
moniae [36]. The primary isotope effect values (DV = 3.5
and DV/K = 3.0) are larger than those for solvent isotope
effects (D2OV = 1.7 and D2OV/K = 1.3), suggesting that pro-
ton and hydride transfer may take place in two distinct
transition-states, with the latter being more rate-limiting
for the MtCS-catalyzed reaction. Multiple isotope effects
studies are able to distinguish whether two different iso-
topic substitutions affect the same or different chemical
steps. Theory predicts that if protonation and hydridetransfer occur in the same transition state, the primary iso-
tope effects will be larger or unchanged with D2O as com-
pared to H2O. On the other hand, if hydride transfer and
protonation occur in distinct steps, the primary isotope
effects will be smaller with D2O as solvent, as proton
transfer will become more rate limiting [37,38]. Multiple
isotope effects were thus evaluated to distinguish whether
two different isotopic substitutions affect the same or dif-
ferent chemical steps, i.e., if the reduction of FMNox cata-
lyzed by MtCS occurs, respectively, in a concerted or in a
stepwise mechanism. Initial velocity data were collected
and values of 1.3 ± 0.1 and 2.2 ± 0.1 were obtained for
D2OV[4S-2H]NADH and D2OV/K[4S-2H]NADH , respectively (Fig-
ure 7, inset). The values for the primary kinetic isotopePrimary and multiple deuterium kinetic isotope effectsFigure 7

(page number not for citation purposes)effects on V and V/K in D2O were smaller than the effects
in H2O, thereby suggesting a stepwise mechanism for the
reduction of FMNox. A mechanism for bifunctional NcCS
has been proposed and involves an electron transfer from
FMNred to C1 EPSP and C-O bond cleavage, protonation
of the leaving phosphate group by His17, tautomerization
of the resulting C4(a)-neutral flavin semiquinone to a
radical species with concomitant abstraction of the C-
(6proR) hydrogen of the dephosphorylated substrate
intermediate, and reduced flavin deprotonation restores
the initial state of the cofactor [24]. More recently, it has
been shown for NcCS that the carboxylate group of
Asp367 participates in the water-mediated deprotonation
of the N(5) atom of the isoalloxazine ring system of FMN-
red that is involved in abstraction of C-(6 proR) hydrogen ofEPSP [39]. A comparison of the primary sequences of CSs
from different sources has shown that these residues
(His11 and Asp343, M. tuberculosis numbering) are con-
served [18]. Interestingly, His11 and Asp343 are present
in monofunctinal and bifunctional CSs and across all
known species [40], and these residues are part of the
characteristic CS signature sequence [23]. The role of
His11 and Asp343 in the mode of action of bifunctional
MtCS should await site-directed mutagenesis studies that
are currently underway in our laboratory.
Conclusion
It has recently been pointed out that we are currently una-
ble to predict bifuncionality based on sequence informa-
tion and three-dimensional structures available at presentSolvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects and proton inventoryFigure 8

(page number not for citation purposes)because of difficulties in identifying the NAD(P)H-bind-
ing site of bifunctional CSs [40]. Incidentally, the three-
dimensional structural model [41] and X-ray diffraction
structure [18] of MtCS employed the crystal structure of
CS from Streptococcus pneumoniae [23] as template, which
is a monofunctional CS. It is thus necessary to measure CS
enzyme activity to show whether it depends on a source of
free reduced FMN (monofunctional) or can directly
reduce FMN cofactor at the expense of NAD(P)H (bifunc-
tional). Here we present experimental evidence that
recombinant MtCS is bifunctional. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report showing that a bacterial
CS is bifunctional. We also show that FMN and NADH
bind to free MtCS. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope
effects of the NADH-dependent flavin reductase activity of
MtCS showed that C4-proS hydrogen is transferred during
the reduction of FMNox, and that hydride transfer contrib-
utes significantly to the rate-limiting step of FMN reduc-
tion. Solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects suggest that
proton transfer from solvent partially limits the rate of
FMN reduction and that a single proton is transferred
from solvent. Multiple isotope effects indicate that a step-
wise mechanism for the reduction of FMNox. Expression
of functional proteins in soluble form has been identified
as an important bottleneck in efforts to determine biolog-
ical activity and crystal structure of M. tuberculosis proteins
[42]. Moreover, protein purification has become an
important asset in any structural genomic effort as there
has been increasing demand for homogeneous proteins
[43]. Accordingly, the work presented here should con-
tribute to overcome these obstacles for, at least, MtCS and
allow functional and structural efforts to be pursued. We
provide experimental evidence for the correct assignment
of the Rv2540c DNA sequence as a CS-coding aroF gene in
M. tuberculosis , which is a pivotal step for the rational
design of inhibitors of MtCS enzyme activity with poten-
tial antitubercular action. The availability of MtCS and the
experimental evidence given here for an NADH-binding
site warrant further efforts to obtain the crystal structure of
the binary complex to try to elucidate the structural fea-
tures of this interaction and the mechanism of action for
bifunctional CSs. The results reported here should thus
pave the way for further functional and structural studies
to guide the rational design of antitubercular agents.
Methods
Chemical, reagents, enzyme s and bacterial strains
Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. The pET23a(+)
expression vector and E. coli Rosetta(DE3) host cell were
from Novagen. All chromatographic supports, including
the molecular weight calibration kits, were purchased
from GE Healthcare. The protease inhibitor cocktail was
from Roche. Purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP, EC
2.4.2.1) and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribo-
nucleoside (MESG) were purchased from MolecularProbes. NADH, NAD+, oxidized FMN (FMNox), ATP,

Molecular cloning, an d overexpression of M. tuberculosis 
Rv2540c ( aroF ) DNA sequence
Synthetic oligonucleotide primers complementary to
amino-terminal coding and carboxy-terminal noncoding
strands of aroF (Rv2540c) gene (5' ggt catatg ttgcgctggat-
caccgcgg 3' and 5' c ggatcc tcaaccggagacccgcgcggc 3', respec-
tively) were designed based on the complete genome
sequence of M. tuberculosis [13]. These primers, contain-
ing 5' NdeI and 3' BamHI restriction sites, in bold, were
used to amplify aroF-CS encoding gene (1,206 bp) from
M. tuberculosis genomic DNA, using Pfu DNA polymerase
and standard PCR conditions. The amplified fragment
was purified by low melting agarose electrophoresis,
digested with NdeI and BamHI, and cloned into
pET23a(+) expression vector previously digested with the
same restriction enzymes. The aroF gene identity and the
absence of PCR-introduced mutations were confirmed by
DNA sequencing. The pET23a (+)::aroF was transformed
by electroporation into E. coli Rosetta(DE3) host cells and
selected on LB agar plates containing 50 µg.mL-1 carbeni-
cillin and 34 µg.mL-1 chloramphenicol. Single colonies
were used to inoculate 1 L of Luria-Bertani medium con-
taining the same antibiotics and grown for 24 h at 37°C
at 180 rpm with no isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG)
induction. The cells (4.5 g) were harvested by centrifuga-
tion at 3,000 g for 30 min at 4°C.
Recombinant MtCS protein purification
All purification procedures were performed at 4°C. Cells
(25 g) were suspended in 75 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.8 (buffer A) containing proteinase inhibitor cocktail
and 0.2 mg.mL-1 lisozyme; and the mixture was stirred for
30 min. The cells were disrupted by sonication and centri-
fuged at 48,000 g for 30 min to remove cell debris. Strep-
tomycin sulfate was added to the supernantant to a final
concentration of 1% (w/v) and the mixture was stirred for
30 min. The soluble fraction was collected by centrifuga-
tion at 48,000 g for 30 min and dialyzed 3 times against 2
L of buffer A. This sample was clarified by centrifugation
(48,000 g for 30 min), loaded on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow
(2.6 cm × 8.2 cm) anion exchange column previously
equilibrated with buffer A and the proteins eluted using a
linear gradient from 0.0 to 0.5 M NaCl. The fractions con-
taining MtCS were pooled and ammonium sulfate was
added to a final concentration of 0.8 M. This sample was
loaded on a High Load Phenyl-Sepharose (1.6 cm × 10
cm) hydrophobic interaction column pre-equilibratedBMC Biochemistry  2008, 9:13 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/13
Page 13 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.8 M (NH4)2SO4(buffer
B). The proteins were fractionated using a linear gradient
from 0.8 to 0.0 M (NH4)2SO4. The active fractions were
pooled and dialyzed 3 times against 2 L of buffer A. The
sample was loaded on a MonoQ (1.6 cm × 10 cm) anion
exchange column previously equilibrated with buffer A,
and the proteins eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl
(0.0 – 0.5 M). The fractions containing homogeneous
MtCS were pooled, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°C. Samples of each purification step were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE [44]. Protein concentration was
determined by Bradford method [45], using Bio-Rad pro-
tein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as
standard.
Mass spectrometry analysis and N-terminal amino acid 
sequencing
Recombinant MtCS was analyzed using mass spectrome-
try in an adaptation of Chassaigne and Lobinski systems
[46]. Samples were analyzed on a triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer, model QUATRO II, equipped with a stand-
ard electrospray (ESI) probe (Micromass, Altrinchan)
adjusted to ca. 250 µL.min-1. The source temperature
(80°C) and needle voltage (3.6 kV) were maintained con-
stant throughout the data collection, applying a drying gas
flow (nitrogen) of 200 L.h-1 and a nebulizer gas flow of 20
L.h-1. The equipment was calibrated with intact horse
heart myoglobin. Approximately 50 pmol of sample was
injected into electrospray transport solvent to determine
the subunit molecular mass of MtCS. The N-terminal
amino acid residues of purified recombinant MtCS were
identified by automated Edman degradation sequencing
using a PPSQ 21A gas-phase sequencer (Shimadzu).
Determination of native MtCS molecular mass
The molecular mass of native MtCS was determined by gel
filtration using Superdex S-200 (10 mm × 30 cm) column
eluted with buffer A containing 200 µM NaCl at 0.4
mL.min-1. The protein elution was monitored at 280 nm.
The protein molecular weight standards were from Low
Molecular Weight and High Molecular Weight Calibra-
tion kits (GE Healthcare).
EPSP synthesis
Since there is no ESPS commercially available, EPSP was
synthesized using the enzymes shikimate kinase ( MtSK)
and EPSP synthase ( MtEPSPS) from M. tuberculosis
[47,48], and PNP [49,50]. The synthesis was carried out
using 9.6 mM shikimate, 2.4 mM ATP, 3 mM PEP, 0.4 mM
MESG. This reaction mixture was pre-incubated in 50 mM
Tris-HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM KCl pH 7.6 for 3 min at
25°C. Then the three enzymes were added (2.2 U MtSK,
0.7 U MtEPSPS, 2 U PNP) and the reaction mixture was
incubated further at 25°C for 30 min. The enzymes were
then removed by ultrafiltration using a Centricon 3000Da cut-off (Amicon). The filtrated solution, containing
the substrate EPSP, was collected and used to measure
chorismate synthase activity. The reaction catalyzed by
EPSP synthase releases an inorganic phosphate molecule,
which is consumed by PNP. This coupled reaction
changes the equilibrium constant of ESPS synthase reac-
tion, allowing synthesis of higher concentration of EPSP.
One unit (U) of enzyme activity for all enzymes cited in
this work is defined as the amount of enzyme that cata-
lyzes the conversion of 1 µmol of substrate per minute at
25°C in an optical path of 1 cm.
MtCS enzymatic assay for CS activity
The MtCS assay was performed in the forward direction
using 15 µL of ESPS-containing solution (see above), 0.04
mM FMNox, 0.3 mM NADH, 0.2 mM MESG, 1 U PNP in
buffer A. The reaction mixture was incubated for 4 min at
25°C for total consumption of Pi by PNP, and MtCS was
then added. The CS reaction was monitored using a cou-
pled reaction with the PNP enzyme [50]. This enzyme
catalyses the cleavage of MESG by the inorganic phos-
phate molecule which is released by MtCS, and formation
of 2-amine-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine is monitored at
360 nm ( ε = 11.0 × 103M-1 cm-1). The assay was performed
at 25°C and monitored using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spec-
trophotometer. All measurements, including the blanks,
were carried out in triplicate to ensure that reliable data
were being collected.
MtCS and FMNox interaction
The stability of the interaction between FMNox and MtCS
was tested by incubating MtCS with excess FMNox in
buffer A for 12 hours at 4°C in the dark. The mixture was
injected into a HiTrapQ HP anion exchange column pre-
viously equilibrated with buffer A. The sample was eluted
with a linear gradient from 0.0 to 1 M NaCl. Absorption
spectrum of the pool of fractions containing FMNox and
MtCS was measured at wavelengths values ranging from
210 to 600 nm by a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotom-
eter.
FMNox and NADH binding to MtCS measured by, 
respectively, spectrophotometry and spectrofluorimetry
The binding of FMNox to MtCS (35 µM) was assessed as
described by Kitzing et al. [21]. UV-visible difference
absorbance spectra were monitored at 25°C in a double
beam spectrophotometer UV-2550 (Shimadzu) with pho-
tometric accuracy of ± 0.002 absorbance units in the range
0 – 0.5 absorbance. The difference spectra were recorded
using quartz cells with two chambers (Hellma GmbH &
Co) placing identical arrangements in both the sample
(sample cuvette) and reference beam (reference cuvette).
Spectra were recorded from 300 to 600 nm. Differences
between solutions were minimized by filling both sides
(sample and reference cuvettes) from single stock solu-BMC Biochemistry  2008, 9:13 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/9/13

(page number not for citation purposes)tions of FMNox. Microliter additions of FMNox to both one
chamber of the reference cuvette and to the sample
cuvette, followed by mixing of enzyme and FMNox solu-
tions for the latter, allowed direct measurements of the
difference spectra. This procedure is almost mandatory
when change in absorbance signal is relatively small on
interaction. All solutions were in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8
(buffer A).
Fluorescence titration was performed at equilibrium in a
RF-5301PC Spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu) at
25°C by making microliter additions of NADH stock
solution (10 mM) to 2 mL of 1 µM MtCS (active site con-
centration) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (buffer A). Con-
trols were determined, following exactly the same
procedure, by microliter additions of buffer A to account
for changes in protein fluorescence due to dilution. In
order to assess the NADH inner-filter effect in the fluorim-
eter, two cuvettes were placed in series so that the contents
of the first cuvette acted as a filter of the excitation light
and the light emitted from the second cuvette detected. To
the first cuvette, NADH was added, while the second
cuvette contained MtCS. In this manner, NADH inner-fil-
ter effects upon the protein fluorescence could be
assessed. The binding of NADH to MtCS causes a quench
in protein fluorescence ( λexc = 290 nm; 310 ≤ λem ≤ 510
nm), and fluorescence values at the maximum emission
wavelength (345.5 nm) were plotted against increasing
NADH concentrations. The data were fitted to a hyper-
bolic function, yielding a value of 156 (± 12) µM for the
dissociation constant of MtCS-NADH binary complex for-
mation.
MtCS enzymatic assay for NADH:FMN-oxidoreductase 
activity
FMN-reductase activity of MtCS was monitored for the
forward reaction 25°C in buffer A. The activity measure-
ments were based on the decrease of NADH concentration
upon FMN reduction. Owing to the high absorption coef-
ficient of FMN at 360 nm, the consumption of NADH was
monitored at 380 nm ( ε = 0.893 × 103 M-1 cm-1). The
apparent steady state kinetic parameters Km and Vmax of
FMN reductase activity were determined for holoenzyme
MtCS-FMNox in the presence of varying concentrations of
NADH (10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300 µM). The reaction
was started with the addition of 60 nmol of homogeneous
MtCS previously incubated with 40 µM FMNox.
Kinetic isotope effects and proton inventory
[4S-2H]NADH was synthesized as described by Ottolina et
al. [51]. The substrates, [4 S-4-1H]- or [4 S-4-2H]-NADH,
were purified on a MonoQ column as previously reported
[52], and the fractions with absorbance ratios A260 nm /A340
nm ≤ 2.3 were pooled. Both kinetic isotope effects and pro-
ton inventory were determined in buffer A with homoge-neous MtCS previously incubated with 40 µM FMNox.
Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects were deter-
mined from measurements of initial rates in the presence
of varying concentrations of either [4 S-4-1H]- or [4 S-4-
2H]-NADH, and solvent kinetic isotope effects from meas-
urements of initial rates in the presence of varying concen-
trations of NADH in either H2O or 91 atom % D2O.
Multiple isotope effects were determined by measuring
initial velocities in the presence of varying concentrations
of either [4 S-4-1H]- or [4 S-4-2H]-NADH in 90 atom %
D2O. The pD of buffers used on solvent and multiple iso-
tope effects were measured on a pH meter considering pD
= pH + 0.4. Proton inventory was carried out at saturating
NADH concentrations at various mole fractions of D2O.
All measurements were performed in triplicate. The
nomenclature proposed by Northrop [31] and Cook and
Cleland [34] was used to express isotope effects.
Data analysis
Values for the apparent kinetic parameters and their
standard errors were obtained by fitting the data to the
appropriate equations using the non-linear regression
function of SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS, Inc.). The initial rate
measured at seven different NADH concentrations were
fitted to eq. 1.
v = VA/(K + A) (1)
Isotope effect data were fitted to eq 2, which assumes iso-
tope effects on both V/K and V. In equations 1 and 2, V is
the maximal velocity, K is the Michaelis constant, A is sub-
strate concentrations, EV/K and EV are the isotope effects
minus 1 on V/K and V, respectively, and Fi is the fraction
of deuterium label.
v = VA/[K(1 + FiEV/K) + A(1 + FiEV)] (2)
