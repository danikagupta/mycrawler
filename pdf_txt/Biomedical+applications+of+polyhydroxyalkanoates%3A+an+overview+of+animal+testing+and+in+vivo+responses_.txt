polyhydroxyalkanoates, tissue engineeringPolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been established as biodegradable polymers since 
the second half of the twentieth century. Altering monomer composition of PHAs allows the development of polymers with favorable mechanical properties, biocompatibility and 
desirable degradation rates, under specific ph ysiological conditions. Hence, the medical 
applications of PHAs have been explored extensively in recent years. PHAs have been used to develop devices, including sutures, nerve repair devices, repair patches, slings, 
cardiovascular patches, orthopedic pins, adhesion barriers, stents, guided tissue 
repair/regeneration devices, articular cartilage repair devices, nerve guides, tendon repair devices, bone-marrow scaffolds, tissue engineered cardiovascular devices and 
wound dressings. So far, various tests on an imal models have shown polymers, from the 
PHA family, to be compatible with a range of tissues. Often, pyrogenic contaminants copurified with PHAs limit their pharmacologic al application rather than the monomeric 
composition of the PHAs and thus the purity of the PHA material is critical. This review 
summarizes the animal testing, tissue response, in vivo  molecular stability and challenges 
of using PHAs for medical applications. In future, PHAs may become the materials of 
choice for various medical applications.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) represent a
complex class of biopolymers consisting of
various hydroxyalkanoic acids (FIGURE 1) . They
are synthesized by bacteria as storage com-
pounds for energy and carbon, normally in thepresence of excess carbon  and with at least one
nutrient essential for growth, such as nitrogen,phosphorus, sulphur or oxygen, present in
limiting concentration 
[1].
PHAs exhibit a high degree of polymerization
and molecular weight values up to several mil-lion Daltons 
[2]. They are biodegradable, insolu-
ble in water, nontoxic, biocompatible, piezo-
electric, thermoplastic and or elastomeric [1].
These features make them suitable for severalapplications in the packaging industry, medi-cine, pharmacy, agriculture, food industry, asraw materials for enantiomerically pure chemi-cals and in the production of paints 
[1]. PHAscan be obtained from renewable resources;
hence, there has been a tremendous amount ofcommercial interest in these polymers. 
Poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) (P[3HB]), the
most well characterized among all PHAs, wasfirst discovered from the bacterium Bacillus
megaterium  in 1926 
(BOX 1) [3] . 
R-(3HB) remained the only known constitu-
ent of bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoic acids(PHA) until constituents other than 3HB werereported in the 1960s and 1970s. Wallen andRohwedder first reported the identification ofhydroxyalkanoates (HA), such as 3-hydroxy-
valerate (3HV) and 3-hydroxyhexanoate
(3HHx)
[4]. Later, Witholt and colleagues
noted the presence of 3-hydroxyoctanoate(3HO) units 
[5] and small amounts of 3HHx
units [6] in Pseudomonas oleovorans  when grown
on n-octane. CONTENTS

854 Expert Rev. Med. Devices  3(6), (2006)The discovery of various monomeric components revealed a
variety of potentially useful properties of the PHAs andincreased interest in these polymers. At this stage, the firstindustrial production of a co polymer consisting of 3HB and
3HV, sold under the tradename of Biopol
®, was reported by
Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) (BOX 1)  [101]. These polymers
were developed as renewable and biodegradable replacementsfor petroleum-derived plastics. As a result of this commercialinterest, both P(3HB) and P(3HB- co-3HV) became widely
available, which provided opportunities for their evaluation asmedical biomaterials. While these efforts have resulted inseveral promising clinical trials (for a review please refer to 
[7,8])
and development efforts continue, products containing thesematerials have yet to be approved for in vivo  medical use 
[7].
The research interests then mo ved to identify and character-
ize all the different potential HA units that could possibly be aconstituent of this bacterial po lyester. This resulted in the
discovery of numerous HA constituents, including 4-hydroxy-alkanoates 
[9] and 5-hydroxyalkanoates [10], by the end of the
1980s (BOX 1) . To date, approximately 150 different constituents
occurring in PHAs alone as homo polyesters or in combination
as copolyesters are known [11].
After the late 1980s, development in research concerning
bacterial PHA involved the clonin g and characterization of genes
involved in the biosynthesis of these reserve polyesters (BOX 1) .
This breakthrough provided a ne w means of tailoring the proper-
ties of PHA polymers for particular applications and represents apotentially important step in the development of technologies toproduce designer biomaterials for medical use.
At present, the topic of intere st involves the determination of
tertiary and quaternary structures of PHA synthases, the keyenzymes involved in PHA biosynthesis, their catalytic mecha-nisms, substrate specificity and the factors that determine the
molecular weight of the PHA produced. PHAs can be dividedinto two subgroups based on the number of carbon atoms presentin their monomeric units, that is, PHAs with hydroxyalkanoatemonomers of less than six carbon atoms are termed short-chain-length (SCL) PHAs (PHA
SCL) and those with six to 14 carbon
atoms are termed medium-chain-length (MCL) PHAs(PHA
MCL)[12].
The relatively higher cost of PHAs when compared with other
biodegradable polymers has limited their use in bulk product
manufacture. Nevertheless, PHAs are being explored for bio-medical applications, such  as wound management 
[13–15] , nerve
repair [16–20] , drug-delivery systems [7,21–23] , stents [24], soft-tissue
repair [25–29,102] , hard-tissue regeneration [30–39]  and heart tissue
engineering [7,8,40,41] . In the past 3 years, PHAs have become oneof the leading classes of biomater ials under investigation for the
development of tissue-engineered scaffolds, both for hard andsoft tissues, including cardiovascular products. These polymersoffer properties unavailable in existing synthetic absorbable poly-mers, such as polyglycolic acid (PGA) 
[7]. This review summa-
rizes advances in the development of biomedical devices based onPHAs, covering the animal models investigated, tissue response,in vivo  molecular stability and addressing the challenges of using
PHAs for a range of medical applications.

time. The disparity in the properties of various PHAs arisesbecause of their chemical compos ition, either from the length
of the pendant groups that extend from the polymer backbonesor from the distance between the ester linkages in the polymerbackbones 
[42]. For example, the homopolymer, P(3HB), is a
relatively stiff, rigid material that has tensile strength compara-ble with that of polypropylene, whereas the homopolymerP(4HB) is a highly ductile, flex ible polymer with an extension
to break of approximately 1000%, compared with P(3HB),which has an extension to brea k of less than 10%. The intro-
duction of a comonomer into this polymer backbone, signifi-cantly increases the flexibilit y and toughness of the polymer
(extension to break and impact strength) and this is accompa-nied by a reduction in polymer stiffness (Young’s modulus), asdemonstrated in 
TABLE 1 . 
Although the relatively high brittleness of crystalline P(3HB)
is a disadvantage for its medi cal applications, reports have
demonstrated that the mechanical  properties of P(3HB) films
can be improved by the addition of plasticizers [43] or blending
with other degradable polymers [8,27]. The rate of bioresorption
of PHA polymers in vivo  varies considerably and depends pri-
marily on their chemical compos ition. Other factors, such as
surface area (as in the case of  P[4HB]), physical shape and
form, crystallinity and molecular weight, are also found to bevery important (for a detailed review, please refer to 
[7]).
In vivo  responses to PHAs
Although useful information can be derived from in vitro  stud-
ies, results of in vitro  studies are not always good indicators of
in vivo  behavior. Hence, in this review, we will focus mainly on
the in vivo  responses to PHAs. Some of the earliest investiga-
tions of the in vivo  tissue responses to PHA polymers were
made by WR Grace and Co., in the mid-1960s [103]. In theseearly studies, strips of P(3HB) films were implanted subcutane-
ously and intramuscularly in rabbits and removed after 8 weeks.Examination of the implant sites revealed granulomatous foreignbody reactions but these did not af fect the underlying area. Since
these early investigations, many groups have described the in vivo
tissue responses of P(3HB) and P(3HB-co-3HV) in both
biocompatibility and application-directed studies (for a detailed
review, please refer to 
[7]). 
However, most of the previously reported in vivo  studies used
industrial rather than medical grades of PHA polymers andhence need to be interpreted carefully depending upon thepurity of the PHAs. The studies on the biodegradation of PHA
polymers in vivo  also demonstrated notable differences depend-
ing on their chemical compositio n, surface area, physical shape
and form, crystallinity and molecular weight and hence havebeen a major topic in many reviews recently 
[7,8]. For example,
the in vivo  tissue reaction and biodegradation studies of
P(3HB) and P(3HB- co-3HHx) in rabbits revealed that the deg-
radation rate is higher for P(3HB- co-3HHx) compared with
P(3HB)  [44]. The in vivo  degradation of P(3HB- co-3HHx) was
found to occur in amorphous regions leading to more porousstructures for further hydrolysis 
[44]. However, in the case of
P(3HB), in vivo  hydrolysis was found to start from a random
chain scission both in amorphou s and crystalline regions of the
polymer matrix [44].
So far, only a few PHAs, such as P(3HB), P(3HB- co-3HV),
(P4HB), P(3HB- co-4HB), P(3HB- co-3HHx) and
P(3HHx- co-3HO), have undergon e animal testing and in vivo
tests for tissue response and have  been found to be biocompatible
in various host systems (T ABLE 2) . So far, the very limited human
data on products containing these materials have hindered theapproval of in vivo  medical use of PHAs. This further emphasizes
the urge for research on animal testing of PHAs and related prod-ucts in the near future.

Sutures & wound dressings
The desirable features of an ideal surgical suture are high
in vivo  tensile strength during the critical wound-healing
period, rapid absorption rate once  the critical period is over,
minimal tissue reactivity, no memory (the tendency of thesuture to revert to its original  form even after being twisted
or bent), predictable performance, easy suture handling andknot security 
[59]. There are two types of sutures: nonabsorb-
able and absorbable. Various natural absorbable (catgut) andsynthetic absorbable materials (polygalactin-910 [Vicryl
®],
polydioxanone [PDS], polyglyc onate, polyglecaprone-25
[Monocryl] and polygalactin-910 rapide [Vicryl Rapide®])
are available for the applications as sutures. However, the useof natural gut sutures are restricted because of the risk oftransmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) 
[59].
As early as the mid-1960s, it  was suggested that P(3HB)
could be used as an absorbable suture [103]. P(3HB) and
P(3HB- co-3HV) sutures were reported to possess the
strength necessary for the healing of myofascialwounds
[13,14] . These were compared with other natural
absorbable (catgut) and nonabsorbable (silk) sutures. A
typical prolonged (throughout the postsurgery monitoring
period) and pronounced macrop hagal stage was observed in
the female wistar rats implanted with P(3HB) andP(3HB- co-3HV) sutures. Shishatskaya and colleagues
extended their in vivo  study up to a year and found no acute
vascular reaction at the site of implantation or any adverse
events, such as suppurative inflammation, necrosis,
calcification of the fibrous capsule or carcinogenesis 
[14]. The
reaction of tissues to the implantation of P(3HB) andP(3HB- co-3HV) sutures fitted into the usual scheme
characteristic of the wound process and of the reaction to a
foreign-body invasion. In addition, no differences wererecorded between the control and the test animals in the
entire set of physiological bi ochemical parameters, weights of
animals and their internal organs, blood morphology andbiochemistry and lymphoid tissue response 
[14]. Most
importantly, unlike in the previous in vivo  studies [15], they
noted that the presence of hy droxyvalerate in the polymer
did not affect the duration an d intensity of the inflammation
phase and the development of  a fibrous capsule around
sutures. Hence, overall, these in vivo  studies demonstrated
that PHAs could be further developed as future natural
absorbable sutures. 
A highly flexible P(3HB- co-4HB) film was used in the
abdominal cavity of rats betw een incisions in the skin and
intestine to prevent adhesions [105]. After 1 month, the inci-
sions had substantially healed and no adhesion had occurred,
although no in vivo  degradation of the film was observed
even after 1 year. This example emphasizes the need to tailorpolymers to control their degrad ation rate in order to be able
to use them for a range of applications. This tailoring of thedegradation rate is quite readily possible with polymers of thePHA family.Table 2. A summary of polyhydroxyalkanoates used for

Conduits
The four central components of constructs for nerve
regeneration include: a scaffold for axonal proliferation,support cells, such as Schwan n cells, growth factors and an
extracellular matrix 
[60]. An ideal conduit used to bridge nerve
gaps must be easily available, biodegradable, readily
vascularized, have a low antigenicity, be porous for oxygen
diffusion and avoid long-term compression. Nerve conduits
used for peripheral nerve and spinal-cord injuries are typicallytermed as guidance channels and bridges. Guidance channels
have been fabricated from a range of natural (e.g., collagen)and synthetic polymers (e.g ., silicone, ethylene vinyl
coacetate, ethyl vinyl acetat e co-polymer, poly(lactide- co-gly-
colide) [PLG]). Conduits made from these materials possess a
range of degradation rates,  porosities and mechanical
properties. The porosity of th e conduit material affects the
accessibility of soluble growth-promoting factors or nutrientsfrom the surrounding environment 
[61]. Additionally, the
mechanical properties of the conduit must prevent channel
collapse, which would limit ne urite outgrowth and regenera-
tion [62]. Although many materials have been tested, the
distance that these conduits can bridge has traditionally been
limited [60].
The use of a nonwoven P(3HB) sheet as a wrap to repair
transected superficial radial nerves was evaluated in cats forup to 12 months 
[16,17] . The axonal regeneration was demon-
strated to be comparable with  closure with an epineural
suture for a nerve gap of 2–3 mm and the inflammatoryresponse was normal. In a subsequent study, the same materialwas used to bridge an irreducible gap of 10 mm in rat sciaticnerve and the results were co mpared with an autologous
graft
[18]. The rate and amount of regeneration in the P(3HB)
conduit did not fully match the autologous nerve graft but itdemonstrated good axonal regeneration with a low level ofinflammatory infiltration over 30 days. 
In another report, P(3HB) conduits were used to bridge a
10-mm gap in the rat sciatic nerve 
[20]. The conduits were
filled with alginate hydrogel and were incorporated withgenetically labelled Schwann ce lls (SC) and cultured alloge-
neically or syngeneically. It was noted that both allogeneic
and syngeneic SC equally enhanced the axonal regenerationdistance but the number of axons was greater when syngeneicSC were used. In both cases, a deleterious immune responsewas not reported 
[20]. 
Recently, use of a nerve gu ide conduit made of P(4HB)
increased the axonal regenerati on as well as improved the
degree of restoration of mo tor and/or sensory function
compared with the previously  described conduits made of
P(3HB) [53]. The P(4HB), also referred to as PHA4400,
conduits used to bridge 10-mm gap in 30 male Sprague-
Dawley rats sciatic nerve demonstrated an axonalregeneration rate of at least 0.8 mm per day with no evidence
of wound infections, inflamma tion or anastomotic failures
over 20 days. Carrier scaffolds
Injuries to the spinal cord that result in disruption of axonal conti-nuity have devastat ing consequences for injured patients 
[63]. The
two basic components for structure supporting axonal migrationavailable currently are either natural or synthetic materials. A vari-ety of natural materials have been  used for axonal migration, such
as vein, laminin, fibronectin and collagen 
[64]. Although natural
materials are ideal, there are some inherent difficulties, includingundesirable immune responses and batch to batch variation
[65].
On the other hand, synthetic po lymers, such as those based on
poly( α-hyroxy acids), for example, poly( L-lactic acid) or poly(gly-
colic acid), facilitate cell atta chment and directed neurite growth
and have the advantage that they  c a n  b e  e a s i l y  u s e d  t o  f o r m
fibers [66]. However, the degradation products of these polymers
sometimes cause an inflammatory reaction owing to the acidicend products. This can be reduce d substantially by using PHAs,
such as P(4HB), which offer better  mechanical properties and less
in vivo  tissue reaction owing to less acidic end products.
P(3HB) fibers have been used as a carrier scaffold for matrix
components and cell lines supporting neuronal survival andregeneration after spinal-cord injury. Novikov used a graft con-sisting of P(3HB) fibers coated with alginate hydrogel andfibronectin 
[19]. The fiber was implanted in the lesion cavity
after cervical spinal-cord injury in  adult rats. In control groups,
P(3HB) was omitted and only alginate hydrogel or fibronectin,or their combination, were used for grafting. In addition, com-
parisons were made with animals treated intrathecally, after spi-nal-cord injury, with neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor  (BDNF) or neurotrophin-3
(NT-3). The neurons of the rubrospinal tract served as theexperimental model. It was found that 45% of the injuredrubrospinal neurons were lost at 8 weeks postoperatively inuntreated animals. However, implantation of the P(3HB) graftreduced cell loss by 50%, a rescuing effect similar to thatobtained after treatment with BDNF or NT-3. In the absence
of P(3HB) support, implants of only alginate hydrogel or
fibronectin, or their combinat ion, had no effect on neuronal
survival. After the addition of neonatal Schwann cells to theP(3HB) graft, regenerating axon s were seen to enter the graft
from both ends and to extend along its entire length 
[19]. These
results demonstrate beyond doubt the potential of the PHAs ascarrier scaffold materials in nerve repair.
Drug-delivery systems
Conventional drug therapy, administered either intravenously orvia an extravascular route (oral, nasal, sublingual or rectal), typi-cally does not maintain drug co ncentrations within a desired
therapeutic window at the target site for extended periods oftime
[67]. Controlled-release drug therapy circumvents fluctua-
tions inherent to the conventional dosage forms by achieving acontinuous release of drug within  the therapeutic window for the
required time of treatment. Addi tionally, the placement of such a
system at the target location also results in site-specific drugdelivery. The potential use of P(3HB) and P(3HB- co-3HV) in
drug delivery has been evalua ted in a number of studies 
(TABLE 3)Valappil, Misra, Boccaccini & Roy
858 Expert Rev. Med. Devices  3(6), (2006)and reviewed several times (for a recent review, see [7]). Studies
have included investigations of these polymers as subcutaneousimplants, compressed tablets for oral administration and micro-
particulate carriers for intravenou s use. Although there are excep-
tions, the following observations ar e fairly typical, as reported by
Williams and Martin 
[7]:
 Increased valerate content in copolymers of P(3HB- co-3HV)
usually slows down the rate of drug delivery;
 Smaller particle sizes decrease loading capacity but increase
the rate of drug release;
 Large changes in polymer molecular weight lead to enhanced
release rates;
 Drug release from both P(3HB) and P(3HB- co-3HV) is
entirely diffusion controlled;
 Lower drug loading reduces the release rate.
The use of P(3HB- co-4HB) rods as antibiotic carriers for the
treatment of osteomyelitis using Sulperazone™ or Ducoid wasevaluated and compared with P(3HB- co-3HV) 
[82].
P(3HB- co-4HB) was preferred as it was less rigid and easier to
handle as compared with P(3HB- co-3HV) [80]. Recently, Hasirci
and Keskin reported the use of P(4HB), referred to as PHA4400,and its copolymers, such as P(3HB- co-4HB), referred to as
PHA3444, and P(4HB- co-glycolate), referred to as PHA4422, as
matrices for sustained drug delivery 
[107]. The release of tetra-
cycline from these devices demo nstrated that it had desirable
physical properties, including strength, modulus and elongation
compared with previously reported drug-delivery systems [107]. Stents
The development of the recent concept of drug-eluting stenttechnology has revolutionized the field of interventional cardiol-ogy, which had been dominated pr eviously by bare-metal stents
(BMS). One of the main problems with the use of metallicstents in cardiovascula r applications is the subsequent restenosis
that can result from excessive growth of the blood vessel wall 
[67].
The polymer carrier, as a drug-delivery coating on the stent,
needs to meet several criteria . These include compatibility
with the drug, ability to withst and processing, sterilization and
storage, adjustable formulation and drug-release properties.Moreover, good mechanical integrity during handling andthroughout the clinical deployment procedure in the tortuousvessel anatomy, as well as through its residence in the mechan-ically and biologically  demanding coronary artery is essential
along with its vascular compatibility. Recently a lot of atten-tion has focused on the use of PHAs as an alternative tomechanical stents where the PHAs can prevent reocclusion ofthe vessel in the short term but can then be absorbed so that it
does not cause any persistent irri tation of the vessel wall. How-
ever, when P(3HB) biodegradable stents and tantalum stentswere implanted into the iliac arteries of New Zealand whiterabbits for up to 30 weeks, it  was found that P(3HB) insti-
gated intense inflammatory reacti ons with an increase in colla-
gen (2.4- to 8-fold vs native segments), thrombosis and in-
stent lumen narrowing 
[24]. The elastic membranes were
destroyed in all specimens. By contrast, the tantalum stentsincreased the in-stent lumen progressively, penetrated the
external elastic membrane and increased mural collagenTable 3. A summary of polyhydroxyalkanoates reported in drug delivery studies.

or thrombosis. Thus, it was concluded that P(3HB) stents
caused intensive inflammatory va scular reactions in the rabbit
iliac artery, which saw them banned from clinical use [24].
Although the Alcaligenes eutrophus -derived P(3HB) used in
this study was gas sterilized with ethylene oxide prior toimplantation, endotoxin levels in the P(3HB) used were not
quantifie owing to the presence of endotoxins known to copu-
rify with P(3HB), which emphas izes the importance of the
pharmacological purity of PHAs for medical applications.
Soft-tissue repair
Implant patches
Surgical repair of soft tissues, su ch as hernias, was proposed as a
potential use of P(3HB) by Baptist and Ziegler as early as1965
[17]. P(3HB) patches for the gast rointestinal tract utilizing
the rat experimental system were tested [25]. Asymmetric patches
m a d e  f r o m  P ( 3 H B )  s u t u r e d  o n to the stomach wall did not
induce a strong inflammatory response or fibrosis [25]. In another
study, implants of P(3HB) patches produced better results in thestomachs of rats as they adhered well to the gastric wall compared
with the Vicryl patches used normally 
[26].
Improved mechanical properties of P(3HB), such as higher
flexibility and elongation at brea k point, were achieved by blend-
ing bacterial P(3HB) with atactic P(3HB) (at-PHB, preparedfrom 
β-butyrolactone with potassium acetate as catalyst), while
the crystallinity and glass tran sition temperature decreased.
These blends have the potential to be used as a new biomaterialfor temporary soft-tissue applications because of their suitablemechanical properties and tailorable degradation behavior 
[27].
P(3HB)/at-PHB blend was evaluated for repair of a bowel defectin Wistar rats using a patch film  of the blend that was fabricated
by a dipping/leaching method 
[27]. A total of 26 weeks post-
implantation, material remnants were found in only one of the
four animals. The bowel defects were closed in all cases, demon-
strating that the patch material resists intestinal secretions for a
sufficiently long time before  it degrades completely [27]. 
P(3HB- co-3HV) membranes reinforced with
polygalactin 910 (Vicryl) fibers ha ve been used as an occlusive
barrier over implants [28]. This was placed into fresh extrac-
tion sockets of ten dogs having  the third and fourth mandibu-
lar premolars extracted bilaterally. The P(3HB- co-3HV)
membranes used in this study interfered with the marginalbone healing adjacent to the immediately placed implants 
[40].
An increased inflammatory reaction and significantly lessmarginal bone healing was registered near the P(3HB- co-
3HV) membrane compared with the control side 
[29]. The
nonporous P(3HB- co-3HV) film was also tested to keep the
mucoperiosteum and bone sepa rated until the transition of
teeth was completed [28]. After 8 and 12 weeks, the films were
unimpaired and surrounded by fibrous capsules. Thus, it wasconcluded that P(3HB- co-3HV) films were more suitable for
this procedure in terms of mechanical properties and tissueresponse than other synthetic polymers, such as polylacticacid or polycaprolactone. Urological stent
Bowald and Johansson described the use of a tube for urethralreconstruction 
[102]. A solution of the P(3HB- co-3HV) was used
to coat thin, knitted tubes made of Vicryl material and implantedinto four dogs to replace the urethra. After 6–9 months, a fullyfunctional urethra had been reconstructed in all test animals,hence proving the promise of PHAs in urology. 
Artificial esophagus
Corrosive injury of the esophagus in children is a serious condi-tion with many possible compli cations, including perforation,
mediastinitis, fistulization to the greater vessels, penetration to thestomach and stricture formation 
[83]. Recently, some studies using
P(3HB- co-3HHx) as artificial esop hagus material demonstrated
that P(3HB- co-3HHx) can stimulate the regeneration of the
removed esophagus of dogs. Th is result demonstrates that
P(3HB- co-3HHx), which has good elas ticity and strength, could
be a good candidate material for use as an artificial esophagus [8]. 
Dura mater substitute
Significant technical advances, such as imaging and technical
refinements, in recent years have  helped the base of the skull to
be routinely approached for va rious symptoms, such as malig-
nant head and neck tumors  invading the skull base [45]. Bacterial
P(3HB) with synthetic at-PHB has been used as a dura matersubstitute 
[45]. Such patches are of interest since no ideal dura
substitute is available currently, although numerous experimen-tal and clinical studie s have been performed to identify a suita-
ble material. In the past, lyophilized human dura or substitutematerials from animal origin, such as bovine pericardium ordura mater, were used. The availability of these materials is
limited owing, to reports of tran smission of prion diseases such
as CJD or HIV 
[84–86] . 
P(3HB)-based patch materials fulfill the requirements that
are necessary for a dura substitute, including defect closure, sta-bility and biocompatibility. The patch material should help insealing the tissue defect, provide support for tissue regenera-tion, should not adhere to the brain and must be flexible.Blends of PHB/at-PHB 70/30 and 50/50 have a smooth sur-face that prevents the adhesion of brain in addition to being
porous (in contact with the rhinobasal skull) enough to supportbone regeneration. The material was tested in minipigs sincethey have the great frontal sinus near the brain (similar tohuman paranasal sinuses). Experiments were conducted tocover rhinobasal-skull defects, including a dura-mater lesion,using the blends of PHB/at-PHB. Histological examinationafter 3, 6 and 9 months of implantation confirmed defectclosure, prevention of adhesion s to brain tissue and no inflam-
mation or malignant degeneration 
[45]. Hence, PHA-based
materials are promising dura mater substitutes.
Hard-tissue regeneration 
PHAs on their own or as composites in combination with
inorganic phases (to further improve the mechanical properties,rate of degradation and also to impart bioactivity) are beingValappil, Misra, Boccaccini & Roy
860 Expert Rev. Med. Devices  3(6), (2006)considered for hard-tissue engi neering applications. P(3HB),
P(3HB- co-3HV) and P(3HB- co-3HHx) are some of the poly-
mers that have been studied extensively to fabricate compositesin combination with hydroxya patite, bioactive glass and
glass-ceramic fillers or coatings, as reviewed recently 
[87].
Kostopoulus and Karring successfully used P(3HB- co-3HV)
membranes to create spaces for bone fill to treat jaw-bonedefects in rats 
[31]. During a 6-month study, P(3HB- co-3HV)
membranes helped in increasing the bone fill compared with an
uncovered control that demonstrated in growth of other tissues.The same group also successfully used P(3HB- co-3HV)
membranes to increase the height of the rat mandible 
[32].
Several studies of the use of PHA polymers for internal-bone
fixation devices have been reported. For example, the use of com-pression molded T-plates prepared from P(3HB) reinforced withcarbon fibers (7%) to fix osteotomies of the tibial diaphysis inrabbits were described 
[33]. The implants were fixed to the tibia
with absorbable polyglycolic acid (PGA) sutures and comparedwith implants prepared from reinforced Vicryl. After 12 weeks,the reinforced P(3HB) gave better results than the Vicryl plates,with the latter frequently leading to nonunion of the osteo-
tomies, breakage and angulation . Later, Doyle and colleagues
studied the behavior of P(3HB) fi lled with hydroxyapatite (HAp)
in vivo  
[34]. No significant difference between implants derived
from P(3HB) or P(3HB) filled with HAp were observed whenrivets were prepared from these materials and inserted into rabbitfemurs. The overall tissue resp onses were favorable and some
indication of osteogenic ac tivity of P(3HB) was noted 
[34].
Since the homopolymer of P(3HB) is piezoelectric, its role in
inducing local bone formation wa s studied in subsequent years.
Knowles and colleagues demonstrated that the piezoelectricpotential output of P(3HB- co-3HV) composites with glass fibers
is fairly close to that of bone 
[35]. Furthermore, the same group
implanted P(3HB- co-3HV)-phosphate glass composites subcuta-
neously and as nonload bearin g femoral implants in rats [36,37] .
Initially, relatively high cellular activity was observed that wasattributed to ions being released from the glass. At 4 weeks, cells
were seen entering the surfac e pores in the femoral implants
formed by the solubilizing glass and, over time, new bone wasseen developing on the implant surface. However, when compos-ites of P(3HB- co-3HV)/HAp and P(3HB- co-3HV)/HAp-glass
were implanted in rabbit femurs, the former bonded better thanthe latter. This result was attributed to the release of ions fromthe P(3HB- co-3HV)/HAp-glass composites  causing a soft-tissue
reaction 
[38,39] . More recently, the interface between
P(3HB)/HAp composites and bone when implanted in vivo  was
studied in rabbits [88]. After 1 month of implantation, bone
apposition occurred along the wh ole length of the implant inter-
face. At 3 months after the implantation, bone formation withan interlocking structure was ob served on the exposed HAp par-
ticles at the interface, followed  by dense bone formation after
6 months of implantation. 
In addition to composites in corporating HAp and bioactive
glass in PHAs, Jones and coll eagues tested composites of
P(3HB- co-3HV) with tricalcium phosphate filler insubcutaneous and femoral implants 
[89]. These implants were
compared with composites de rived from PLA and tricalcium
phosphate and found to degrade approximately four times slower
in vivo.  Recently, an in vivo  study of porous P(3HB- co-3HV) and
calcium phosphate-loaded collag en (CaP-Gelfix) foams in rat
femurs was reported [30]. Both cell-loaded and cell-free
P(3HB- co-3HV) matrices elicited mi nimal fibrous-tissue forma-
tion during the 6-week implan tation. Moreover, macroscopic
and radiological studies demo nstrated better healing with
P(3HB- co-3HV) matrices than with CaP-Gelfix in 3 weeks.
However, histologically, fibrous connective tissue establishment
and inflammation scores were significantly higher in the
CaP-Gelfix group when compared with the P(3HB- co-3HV)
group [30]. Research is presently being carried out in our labora-
tory to create novel PHA compos ites containing bioactive glass
(Bioglass®) particles. Initial attempts have been carried out to
form 3D porous P(3HB)/Bioglass scaffolds. This is the first timethat Bioglass of type 45S5 (45 wt% SiO
2, 24.5 wt% Na2O, 24.5
wt% CaO and 6 wt% P2O5) has been combined with PHAs for
tissue engineering applications (MISRA AND COLLEAGUES,
UNPUBLISHED DATA) .
Overall, therefore, PHAs and their composites are promising
new materials for hard-tissue regeneration.
Heart tissue engineering
Cardiovascular diseases are th e most common causes of death
and serious morbidity in the world [90]. In most cases, surgical
treatment is necessary and patc h closure, reconstruction of
the defect or revascularization is required [91]. The patch
materials used currently are li mited to prosthetic materials,
autologous pericardium and allo genic or xenogenic (glutaral-
dehyde-fixed) pericardium [92]. These materials are unable to
regenerate, repair and remodel,  leading to aneurysm forma-
tion in patch aortoplasty, inelas ticity and a high risk of hemo-
lysis induced by contact with blood. An optimal cardio-
vascular patch material should have long durability, lack
thrombogenicity, be resistant to infections, lack immuno-genicity, have a potential for cell growth and the ability to
prevent patch dilata tion and thinning. 
Pericardial patch
One of the most advanced applications of PHA polymers in
cardiovascular products has been the development of a regen-erative P(3HB) patch that can be used to close the pericar-dium after heart surgery, thus  preventing adhesions between
the heart and sternum 
[46,47] . However, the P(3HB) patch
generated a strong immunogenic reaction in sheep modelswith the polymer being phagocytosed by polynuclear macro-phages. However, in this study, the sheep were not subjectedto bypass surgery, which is co nsidered more clinically rele-
vant. Promising results were, however, obtained in the firstclinical study of P(3HB) patches carried out in a set of50 human patients who had undergone bypass surgery andvalvular replacement 
[48]. Using computed tomography (CT),
39 of these patients (19 with  patch and 20 without) wereBiomedical applications of polyhydroxyalkanoates
www.future-drugs.com 861examined for the presence of adhesions at 6 and 24 months.
The group with PHA patches deve loped lesser adhesions, thus
indicating that these biodegrada ble polymers could be used as
pericardial patches. 
Artery augmentation
Studies on P(3HB) nonwoven pa tches, as transannular patches,
were carried out by implanting them into the right ventricularoutflow tract and pulmonary artery in 13 weaning sheep 
[49].
Regeneration of a neointima and a neomedia, comparable tonative arterial tissue, was observed in the test group after3–24 months. In the control group, a neointimal layer waspresent but no neomedia comparable to native arterial tissuewas found. These results demonstrate the potential of P(3HB)nonwoven patches as scaffold s for tissue regeneration in
low-pressure systems. 
P(4HB) has been used successfully  as a scaffold for preparing
autologous cardiovascular tissue 
[65]. Patches of P(4HB) with
95% porosity and pore sizes in the range 180–240 µm were usedas scaffolds seeded with autologous endothelial, smooth muscleand fibroblast cells to augment the pulmonary artery in a sheepmodel
[51]. Echocardiography and explant examination revealed
progressive tissue regeneration with no evidence of thrombus,stenosis or dilation in the patc h containing sheep. In comparison,
a slight bulging and lesser tissu e regeneration were found at
20 weeks for the control patch. An additional positive feature of
the P(4HB) patching material was a self-sealing property pre-venting blood leakage compared with a polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) patch, which leaves a hole for blood to leak. 
Vascular grafts
V a s c u l a r  g r a f t i n g  i s  u s e d  t o  r e p a i r  o r  r e p l a c e  m a l f u n c t i o n i n gblood vessels in the arterial or venous systems due to damageor disease
[7]. Large diameter blood vessels are generally
replaced with synthetic grafti ng materials, usually Dacron™
(polyethylene terphthalate) or expanded PTFE (ePTFE).However, these materials do not perform well for a small-diameter graft since the grafts ra pidly close. Instead, when sur-
geons require small diameter grafts, such as coronary bypassprocedures, they use blood vessels from the patient. Suchautologous grafts can be compro mised or be in short supply if
the patient has had multiple pr ocedures. A synthetic graft was
investigated with P(3HB- co-4HB) as a graft coating in dogs
for up to 10 weeks
[106]. The degradation of the polymer
started after 2 weeks of implantation. However, whenP(3HHx- co-3HO) was used as an impregnation substrate in
rat models, the results demonstrated very slow degradation ofthe polymer (30% reduction in molecular weight after6m o n t h s )  
[57,58] . Further, P(3HHx- co-3HO) was evaluated as
a component of an autologous cell-seeded tissue engineeredvascular graft that also contained a nonwoven PGA mesh onthe inside layers and was studied in lambs 
[56]. All the
P(3HHx- co-3HO)-PGA grafts were found to allow non-
restricted blood flow except for one structure and noaneurysms or inflammatory responses were observed.Recently, P(4HB) scaffolds we re used to create tissue
engineered viable ovine blood vessels and implanted them in a
sheep model 
[50]. The study revealed that the mechanical
properties of the bioreactor cultured tissue engineered blood ves-
sels were very similar to those of the native aorta [50]. In another
similar study, tissue engineered blood vessels (TEBV), autologouscells seeded in P(4HB) scaffolds and cultured in bioreactors were
implanted in the descending aort a of juvenile sheep and found to
be fully functional for up to 3 months. However, at 6 months,the graft remained functional but significantly dilated, caused byan insufficient elastic fiber synthesis 
[53]. 
Heart valves
Recently, some of the most promising results in heart valve devel-opment have been obtained with PHA polymers 
[52,54,55] . Heart
valve replacement surgery is particularly acute for the pediatricpopulation. Currently used heart valve prostheses are nonviable,hence child patients outgrow replacement valves and need repeatsurgeries to replace them. Further, for the adult population,improved valve durability is re quired. A promising approach is
the development of tissue engineered heart valve scaffolds with ahigh degree of maturity  before implantation. 
In early studies, several synthetic absorbable polyesters, such
as PGA and PLA, were evaluated as potential scaffolding mate-rials for heart valves 
[7]. However, the synthetic polyesters were
too stiff to function as flexible leaflets inside a trileafletvalve
[7]. Interestingly, the leaflets  replaced with porous and
relatively more flexible P(3HHx- co-3HO)-PGA mesh were
found to be more suitable in the in vivo  study in lambs [54].
The postoperative echocardiography of the vascular cellsseeded P(3HHx- co-3HO) constructs revealed no thrombus
formation with mild stenosis and trivial regurgitation for up to17 weeks after implantation in a lamb model 
[55]. It was
concluded that tissue engineer ed heart valve scaffolds made
from P(3HHx- co-3HO) can be used for implantation in the
pulmonary position for 120 days in lambs [55]. 
In order to achieve more rapid tissue remodeling in vivo ,
recently, a porous scaffolding mate rial in the form of a trileaflet
heart valve was produced from a PGA nonwoven mesh solventcoated with P(4HB) 
[52]. In an  in vivo  study, implantation of
the tissue engineered heart valve in place of the native pulmo-nary valve of juvenile sheep was found to function well andechocardiography of the implanted valves demonstrated func-tioning mobile leaflets with out any stenosis, thrombus or
aneurysm. Just 8 weeks after implantation it was reported thatthe composite scaffolds had completely degraded and by20 weeks it had been replaced with a new tissue engineeredheart valve that closely resemble d the native valve. This work
has been reviewed recently and the following points wereemphasized 
[41]:
 The tensile mechanical properties of the valve were almost
indistinguishable from the native valve;
 Biochemical analysis revealed  a similar make up to the 
native counterpart;Valappil, Misra, Boccaccini & Roy
862 Expert Rev. Med. Devices  3(6), (2006) Histological analysis of the leaflet structure (perhaps the most
striking result) demonstrated that the new structure was made
up of three distinct organized layers: a fibrous layer of collagen,a loose layer rich in glycosaminoglycans and a layer of elastinthat is characteristic of the native leaflet structure;
 The size of the valve had increased from 19 mm at implant to
23 mm at 20 weeks, as the lamb had grown. 
This is certainly one of the most promising results of heart
tissue engineering since it indicate s that it should be possible to
develop a valve for children that can grow and therefore does notneed to be replaced. 
Relevance of pharmaco logically pure PHAs
The outstanding positive biolog ical response to PHA polymers
in vivo  represents the most important property of these bio-
materials if a medical application is being contemplated. Mostof the previously reported studies have been based on the use ofindustrial rather than medical grades of PHA polymers andhence pyrogenic contaminants copurified with PHAs mighthave been the cause of adverse tissue responses as opposed tothe monomeric composition of the PHAs.
In general, the PHA recovery processes from bacteria can be
divided into two categories: so lvent extractions and aqueous
digestions. Both processes have to fulfill several conditions: highpurity of the end-product, avoi dance of halogenated solvents, no
degradation of the polymer and high efficiency. Currently,PHAs are produced at an industrial scale using Gram-negativebacteria exclusively (such as Wautersia eutropha , Methylobacte-
rium organophillum , Pseudomonas oleovorans  and recombinant
Escherichia coli ). However, PHAs isolated from Gram-negative
organisms, such as E. coli , contain the outer membrane lipopol-
ysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins, which are pyrogens known tocopurify with the PHAs. The presence of LPS induces a strongimmunogenic reaction and is th erefore undesirable for the bio-
medical application of the PHAs 
[8]. Owing to the serious risks
associated with endotoxin, the US FDA has set guidelines for
medical devices and parenteral drugs [93]. Current limits are such
that eluates (endotoxin free water where the medical devices areimmersed for at least 1 h at room temperature) should notexceed 0.5 EU/ml of endotoxin, unless the device comes intocontact with cerebrospinal fluid, where the limit is then0.06 EU/ ml 
[94].
PHAs produced by the fermentation of Gram-negative bacte-
ria can be treated with an oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen per-oxide or benzoyl peroxide, to reduce the endotoxin content to
less than 20 endotoxin units/gram of PHA to produce PHA thatdoes not elicit an acute inflammatory response when implantedin an animal 
[42]. Lee and colleagues have demonstrated that
sodium hydroxide can also be  used to remove endotoxin [95].
Tepha, Inc. (MA, USA) produces P(4HB), which meets thestandards set by the FDA for endotoxin and biocompatibilitytests recommended in 1995 by the Office of Device Evaluationin their general program me morandum #G95–1 ‘Biological
Evaluation of Medical Devices’
[41]. Gram-positive bacteria lackLPS and are hence potentially better sources of PHAs to be used
for biomedical applications, as reviewed recently [96]. Recently,
supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with CO2 was suggested as a
promising approach for the purification of PHAs because it doesnot use toxic solvents or a drying step and the process does notdegrade the polymer sample 
[201]. 
Expert commentary
The many successful studies using various animal models haveclearly demonstrated that PHAs, represented by P(3HB),P(3HB- co-3HV), P(4HB), P(3HB- co-4HB), P(3HB- co-3HHx)
and P(3HHx- co-3HO), possess the biodegradability, biocompat-
ibility and thermoprocessibility required for various medicalapplications. Some of the patents granted since the year 2000, for
a variety of biomedical devices based on PHAs, are tabulated in
TABLE 4 . Depending on the property requirement for different
applications, PHAs can be blende d, surface modified or compos-
ited with other polymers, enzymes or even inorganic materials (asfillers or coatings) to further adju st their mechanical properties or
biocompatibility. Even blending among the several PHA them-selves can change the material properties and biocompatibility.
The enormous possibility to tailor-make PHAs for specific medi-cal devices has made this class of materials promising as tissue
engineering scaffolds. For example, one of the most promisingPHAs are P(4HB) 
[41] fibers, which are stronger than typical
polypropylene sutures (410–460 MPa) and at least comparablein strength to commercial absorbable sutures, such as Maxon™(540–610 MPa) and PDS II™ (450–560 MPa) 
[92]. What may
potentially set the P(4HB) suture fiber apart from currentabsorbable synthetic fibers is a lower Young’s modulus resultingin improved handling and a differ ent breaking strength retention
profile upon implantation. Th e Young’s modulus of oriented
P(4HB) fibers (670 MPa), for ex ample, is significantly lower
t h a n  t h a t  o f  o t h e r  m o n o f i l a m e n t  s u t u r e s ,  s u c h  a s  M a x o n(2930 MPa), PDSII (1380 MPa) and Biosyn™ (1000 MPa) 
[97]. 
From initial studies, it appears that P(4HB) degrades faster than
other PHAs, such as (P3HB), in a subcutaneous environment [41].
I n  o n e  i m p l a n t a t i o n  s t u d y ,  t h e  l o s s  o f  m a s s  f r o m  a  P ( 4 H B )implant was found to vary with porosity
[51] and surface area.
P(4HB) polymers are likely to undergo gradual changes inmechanical properties rather than the more abrupt changesobserved with other synthetic ab sorbable polymers, such as PGA.
This could potentially be advant ageous in applications where a
sudden loss of a mechanical prop erty is not desirable and a grad-
ual loss of implant mass with conc omitant growth of new tissue is
beneficial. Further, owing to its lower pK
a and tendency to lac-
tonize, 4HB is less acidic than the α-hydroxy acids, such as gly-
colic and lactic acids, that are released from PGA and PLLA
implants, causing lesser irrita tion. Moreover, P(4HB), unlike
PGA, is relatively stable to moisture even during processing andhas a satisfactory shelf life. Finally, all currently used cardiovascu-lar prostheses (namely, PTFE, Dacron, fixed pericardium,xenografts, mechanical heart valv es and homograf ts) do not have
any endothelial coverage owing to  poor adherence to prosthetic
grafts. However, seeding of autologous cells and in vitroBiomedical applications of polyhydroxyalkanoates
www.future-drugs.com 863conditioning of a PHA graft was found to be promising since the
cells attach themselves readily to the PHA scaffold [98]. Hence,
further experiments on these new constructs might improve
endothelial coverage, which will be  highly beneficial in a tissue
engineered cardiovascular construct. 
Five-year view
In vivo  studies
Early results summarized in this review thus indicate that certain
polymers of the PHA family, such as P(3HB), P(3HB- co-3HV),
P(4HB), P(3HB- co-4HB), P(3HB- co-3HHx) andP(3HHx- co-3HO), are filling an unmet need for new absorbable
biomaterials with properties unav ailable in alternative materials
for medical product development. Among all other applicationsinvestigated in the pa st 5 years, PHAs have become one of the
materials of choice for the development of tissue-engineered car-diovascular products because they can offer properties not availa-ble in other syntheti c absorbable polymers, such as PGA, PLLA
or polycaprolactone.

cardiovascular products made of PHAs, such as tissue-engineered
heart valves, are expected to become a clinical reality only withinthe next decade. Recently, one of the very promising early studies
that attempted to create human cardiovascular tissue in vitro
using P(4HB) was reported 
[98]. Although tissue engineering of
autologous human cardiovascular patches appears promising,issues, such as endothelial coverage and control of extracellularmatrix formation, have to be addressed in future in vivo  experi-
ments before a final human implantation can take place. How-ever, the developments in the cardiovascular application of PHAsand its market impacts are growing at a fast pace. Tepha Inc.(MA, USA), the world’s leading company developing PHAs formedical applications, emphasizes that the market, just for heartvalves and related products, in creased from US$420 million in
2001 to $573 million in 2006 
[202]. Moreover, the company fore-
casts dramatic gains in the future  in the cardiovascular applica-
tion of PHAs as the market for a transcatheter segment alone ispredicted to potentially exceed $500 million by 2010. 
Availability of PHAs
Scaling up the production of ph armacologically relevant PHAs,
such as P(4HB), needs more attention as the currentlyemployed fermentation strategies often result in less pure poly-mers. Progress is being made in using plants as the source ofpharmacologically pure PHAs. However, research advancesneed to be made to improve low PHA contents in plant cells,overcome the compartmentalization of PHA biosynthesis geneexpression in plant hosts and es tablish an efficient method of
isolation of PHAs from plants. We forecast that it will be atleast 10–15 years before PHAs can be obtained commerciallyfrom agriculture. 
Novel PHAs
Another aim must be the detect ion of novel PHAs, which might
exhibit features not demonstrat ed by other synthetic polymers
and are therefore of extra value. The physical and mechanicalproperties of PHAs are dependent on the compound’s mono-meric composition. Recently, the Gram-negative PHA accumu-
lating bacterium Ralstonia eutropha  synthesized a copolymer of 3-
hydroxybutyrate and 3-me rcaptopropionate, P(3HB- co-3MP),
which might be used, for example,  as a skin substitute because
these new polymers may exhibit antifungal and antibacterialproperties 
[99]. In future, we suggest that PHAs incorporating
antimicrobial ions, such as coppe r and silver, could be produced.
These materials would act as antimicrobial ion-releasing implantsthat would fight bacterial infe ctions by releasing ions, thusavoiding the need for antibiotics in postoperational healing. To
this end, we think that some strains of the PHA-accumulatingbacterial genera, Pseudomonas , which are also known to accumu-
late metals (e.g., Pseudomonas stutzeri  AG259), could be used for
the production of metal-containing PHAs. 
Overall, the review of the recent literature presented here
reveals that PHAs are promising new materials in the everevolving area of materials fo r biomedical applications. PHAs
have the potential to meet a la rge number of requirements for
the design and fabrication of biomedical devices in the nearfuture. These polymers, if used judiciously and innovatively,have the scope of revolution izing the use of biodegradable
polymers in medicine.

Key issues
 Production of cost-effective and pure, medically relevant 
polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) is discussed along with the possibilities of producing new PHAs with novel properties for diverse medical applications.
 PHAs are becoming increasingly important in medical 
applications owing to desirable properties, such as biodegradability, biocompatibility and mechanical characteristics, they offer in vivo . This fact, coupled with the 
feasibility of producing medi cally relevant PHAs in a 
pharmacologically pure grade, have contributed to significant developments in this field during the past 6 years.
 Tailored physical, biological and mechanical properties, as 
well as predictable degradatio n behavior, of PHAs can be 
achieved by choosing the right microorganism and carbon source or by employing genetically modified organisms to produce PHAs.
In vivo  tissue responses during va rious medical applications 
of PHAs are discussed in relati on to some of the alternative 
available materials.
