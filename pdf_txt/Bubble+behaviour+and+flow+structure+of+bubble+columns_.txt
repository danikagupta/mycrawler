Bubble column and slurry bubble column re actors are used in numerous industrial 
applications. In these systems gas sparged th rough the liquid rises in  forms of bubbles of 
various sizes and provides the energy via in terfacial momentum transfer for vigorous 
mixing of the liquid. The Euler-Euler appro ach describes the motion of the two-phase 
mixture in a macroscopic sense, which is pref erred for industrial applications.  To model 
the drag force term, which is one of the key closures, most numerical  simulations resort 
to a single particle model with a so-called “mean” bubble size. This assumption is 
physically unrealistic in chur n-turbulent flow regime a nd results in poor gas holdup 
prediction and limited capability for interfacial  area concentration prediction. Moreover,  
  the determination of the assumed “mean” bubb le size needs a trial- and-error procedure 
which significantly compromises the predic tion capability of Computational Fluid 
Dynamics (CFD) approach. This research shows that bubble colu mn flows could be 
better modeled by explicitly accounting for bubble breakup and coalescence with the 
implementation of Bubble Population Balance Equation (BPBE) into the CFD code. 
When the breakup rate is increased by an order of magnitude, compared to values 
predicted by models in the literature, th e implementation of BPBE leads to better 
agreement of CFD prediction with all ava ilable data for gas hol dup and liquid axial 
velocity distribution, compared to the simu lation based on an estimated constant mean 
bubble diameter. The choice of currently available bubble breakup and coalescence 
closures has some but not a significant im pact on the simulated results. Quantitative 
comparisons with the experimental da ta (Kumar, 1994; Degaleesan, 1997; Chen  et al. , 
1999; Ong, 2003; Shaikh  et al. , 2003) demonstrate that CF D model coupled with BPBE 
provides satisfactory mean axial liquid ve locity and gas holdup profile for columns 
operated over a wide range of superficial velo city, operating pressure, physical properties, 
and column diameter. The bubble Sauter mean diameter and interfacial area per unit volume are also reasonably predicted. For reactor modeling, convective and axial 
dispersion time scales are predicted correctly, improvement is needed for the radial 
dispersion time scale which is currently overpredicted.

Introduction 
 
1.1 Research Motivation 
Multiphase reactors are at the heart of chemical indus try. Reactions between gas 
and liquid are frequently encountered in chemical, petrochemical, and biochemical 
processes. The classification of gas-liquid react ors is based on the dispersed phase nature 
and, hence, two main groups of such contactors  are defined - reactors with dispersed gas 
phase and reactors with disperse d liquid phase. For a majority of gas-liquid reactions, the 
interfacial mass transfer resist ance is concentrated in the liquid phase, leading to the 
application of reactors with continuous liquid and dispersed gas phase. In cases where the 
third solid phase is also pr esent, the choice of the liqui d as the continuous phase is 
understandable regarding the requirements of  the highest possible solids hold-up and 
minimum energy consumption for its disper sion. Bubble column reactors are at the 
forefront of such applications. 
Figure 1.1 shows a typical bubb le column, in which gas is  sparged in the form of 
bubbles, using a distributor (sparg er), into a medium of liquid or liquid-solid suspensions.  
Heat exchanger tubes may be inserted into th e reactor for cooling/heating the system and 
maintaining isothermal conditions, especi ally for highly exothermic/ endothermic 
reactions.  In addition, in some cases the co lumn may be sectionalized using baffles to 
inhibit liquid backmixing.  Gas is typically reactant, liquid is usually product and/or 
reactant (sometimes inert), while the solid pa rticles are typically catalyst (or product).  
Bubble columns usually operate with a length to diameter ratio, or aspect ratio, of at least 
five.  Liquid (slurry) is used in either semi-batch ( zero liquid throughputs)  or continuous   2 
 
 mode (co-current or counter-cu rrent with resp ect to the  gas flow), with liquid superficial 
velocitie s lower than  the gas super ficial ve locity by at least one order of m agnitude. 
Mom entum is transfe rred from  the faster, upward m oving, gas phase to the slower liquid 
(slurry) phases.  As a r esult, it is a flow that is buoyancy driven and gas controls its 
dynam ics.  A significan t advan tage of bubble co lumn reactors is their excellent m ixing, 
comparable to that achieved in agitated reac tors but without moving parts (sm aller capital 
and m aintenance costs) and with m uch lower power consum ption. These excellent 
mixing characteristics lead to nearly isothe rmal operation (good he at transfer) and, 
together with capabilities of  using fine catalyst particle s, to good mass transfer and 
improved production. H owever such significant b ack-m ixing also results  in relatively low 
conversion f or a given reactor volume that  if plug flow could be m aintained.

 Bubble colu mn reacto rs are widely  used in F ischer-T ropsch synthesis, in fine 
chem icals production,  in oxidation reaction s, in alkylation reactions, for effluent  
treatm ent, in coal liqu efaction, in  ferm entation reaction s and m ore recen tly, in cell 
cultures, waste water treatm ent and singl e cell protein production.  The prim ary 
advantages of bubble colum n reactors are easy construction due to  no m oving parts 
(which leads to easier m aintenance), high interfacial area concentration, good m ass/heat 
transfer rate between gas and liquid phase, and large liquid holdup which is favorable for 
slow liquid phase reactions (Shah  et al. , 1982).  Figure 1.2 illust rates the phenom ena that 
affect bubble colum n perform ance.  In desi gn, scale-up and scale-dow n of such reactors 
the understanding of the fluid dynami cs is a critical issue.

 From the industrial point of view, churn-turbulent flow is  of most inte rest as it 
ensures high volumetric productivity. Yet this  flow is poorly unders tood. An important 
task is to describe the large scale mixing of  the liquid and gas phase in columns operated 
in the churn-turbulent flow regime. It ha s been demonstrated that gas holdup radial 
profile is almost  parabolic (Kumar et al. , 1997b) with the highest value at the center of 
the column, and that after one to 1.5 diamet ers from the sparger such profile becomes 
height invariant (George  et al. , 2000; Shollenberger  et al., 2000; Ong, 2003) and it drives, 
in a time-averaged sense, a single cel l liquid recirculation (Degaleesan, 1997). 
Superimposed on this large scale convective motion, caused by the persistent difference 
in buoyancy forces, is eddy dispersion (Figure 1.3), driven by bubble wakes and 
meandering pathways, with axial diffusivity exceeding radial by an order of magnitude 
(Degaleesan, 1997). This experimental evidence, imbedded in phenomenological 
physically based models has been highly su ccessful in predicti ng liquid (Degaleesan  et 
al., 1996b) and gas phase mixing (Gupta  et al. , 2001a). Since such phenomenological 
models can predict liquid and gas tracer dynamic responses faithfully (Degaleesan  et al., 
1996b; Gupta  et al. , 2001a), it is important to examine whether the parameters needed by 
such models can be computed by Computatio nal Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This requires 
computation of gas radial holdup distri bution, liquid recircula tion velocity, eddy 
diffusivities, mean bubble size and in terfacial area per unit volume. 
There are different approaches in CFD. For the churn turbulent flow regime only 
the Euler-Euler k-fluid model or Algebraic Slip Mixture Model (A SMM) seems practical. 
However, most previous attempts (e.g. Pa n and Dudukovic, 2001) utilized an assumed 
mean bubble size for evaluation of the drag. This assumed size was often adjusted based 
on attempts to match model predictions to so me measured result. Hence, the model was 
not fully predictive. Moreover, even with 3D  simulations holdup profiles were not always 
predicted well, and interfacial areas were pr e-judged by assumption of the bubble size. In 
addition, in churn-turbulent flow , bubble-bubble inter actions result in widely distributed 
bubble sizes that may be substantially differe nt from the “mean” bubble size assumption. 
A remedy to this situation can be developed by implementation of the bubble population   5 
 
 balance equ ation (BPBE) in the Eu ler-Eule r model or in the ASMM.  This elim inates  the 
assum ption of single constant bubble size and should im prove the gas holdup profile  
prediction.  Most im portantly, the im plementation of BPBE allows one to predict the 
bubble size distribution locally, and elim inates the trial-and- error procedure regarding the 
unknown mean bubble diam eter m entioned above,  while also providing the estim ate of 
the interfacial area co ncentration locally throughout th e colum n. The refore, it would 
substantially  increase th e capability o f CFD m odeling on bubb le colum n reactors.

 1.2 Research Objectives 
The primary objective of this thesis is to advance the understanding of gas-liquid 
bubble column hydrodynamics in the range of industrially relevant  operating conditions. 
Specifically, three major research goals are: 
1) To test the existing bubble breakup and coalescence  closures by implementing 
them into the CFD framework, 2) to impr ove the prediction of gas holdup profiles and 
produce an estimation of local interfacial ar ea per unit volume with the help of bubble 
population balance model, and 3) based on the improved CFD model mentioned above, 
provide parameters that can be used in a phenomenological model for interpretation of 
tracer responses in liquid and gas phase and for reactor modeling. 
To accomplish these goals, the existing bubble coalescence and breakup models 
are implemented into the two-fluid model and the ASMM in FLUENT framework.  At 
CREL, the CARPT/CT technique has earlier been used to establish the database for the 
time averaged gas holdup, liquid velocity and Reynolds stresse s for the air-water system. 
This database is used to validate the closures and improve the gas holdup profile and 
interfacial area density predic tion. Further, the improved tw o-fluid model is used to 
provide parameters for the phenomenologi cal model of the bubble column (e.g. 
Degaleesan  et al. , 1997; Gupta  et al. , 2000) by performing numerical particle tracking 
and numerical tracer experiments.

 Chapter 2   
Background and CFD models 
 
Bubble column reactors are widely used for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, in fine 
chemicals production, in oxidation reactions, and in alkylation reactions, for effluent 
treatment, in coal liquefaction, in fermen tation reactions and more recently, in cell 
cultures, waste water treatment and singl e cell proteins production.  The primary 
advantages of bubble column reactors are easy construction due to no moving parts 
(which leads to easier main tenance), high interfacial area concentration, good mass/heat 
transfer rate between gas and liquid phase, and large liquid holdup which is favorable for 
slow liquid phase reactions (Shah  et al. , 1982).  The performance of bubble column 
reactors depends on gas holdup and liquid velocity distribution, bubble breakup, 
coalescence and dispersion rate, bubble rise ve locity, bubble size dist ribution, gas-liquid 
interfacial area distribution, intraphase turbulence, gas- liquid mass/heat transfer 
coefficients and the extent of liquid phase backmixing (Krishna et al. , 1996; Dudukovic  
et al. , 1997). 
Fluid dynamical features of bubble column reactors have been investigated for 
many years and there is a vast body of literature available for different gas-liquid systems, 
Nevertheless, fundamental f eatures of fluid dynamics in  bubble columns, which are 
essential for reactor design, s cale-up and scale-down, are sti ll not fully understood mainly 
due to the complicated nature of multiphase flow.  This lack of understanding of bubble 
column flows stems from the existence of the multi-time-and-length scales within the 
column.  Although the recent advances in novel techniques have enabled the 
measurement of the instanteneous large scale phenomena and their subsequent 
characterization, measurement at relatively small scales under actual operating condition   8 
 
 (e.g. high superficial gas velocity, high pressu re, heavy solid loading, etc.), which is 
critical for the understanding of the buble co lumn flows, is still rare.  The m ain 
achievem ents in the experim ental invest igation of bubble colum n flows are the 
measure ment of gas holdup, liquid velocity, di spersion, turbulent param eters, m ass and 
heat transpo rt coefficien ts.  Mos t of the earlier studies focused on the m easure ment of 
global hydrodynam ic param eters, like overall gas holdup and volum etric m ass transfer 
coefficient (Mashelkar, 1970; Shah  et al. , 1982; Saxena, 1995). T his has changed 
prim arily thanks to the developm ent of ne w so phisticated experi mental techniques like 
Laser Doppler Anemom etry-LDA (Mudde  et al. , 1997a), Computer Autom ated 
Radioactive  Particle T racking -CARPT (Lin  et al. , 1985; Devanathan  et al. , 1990; 
Moslem ian et a l., 1992; Yang  et al. , 1993; Larachi  et al. , 1994; Lim trakul, 1996; 
Degaleesan, 1997), Particle Im age Velocim etry-PIV (Chen and Fan, 1992; Tzeng  et al. , 
1993; Chen  et al. , 1994), γ-ray Com puted Tom ography-CT (Kum ar et al. , 1995; Adkins  
et al. , 1996; Kum ar et al. , 1997a; Shollenberger  et a l., 1997), Electrical Im pedance 
Tom ography (Dickin  et al. , 1993), Electrical Capacitance To mography (Warsito and Fan, 
2001) and point optical and conductance probes  (Choi and W. K., 1990; Cartellier, 1992; 
Chabot and De Lasa, 1993; Mudde and Saito , 2001; Xue, 2002). These new techniques 
made the local quantitative char acterization of the fluid dynam ics feasible.  The review of 
these experim ental investigations  is out of the scope of this  thesis and  therefore is  not 
discussed here. 
The m odeling investigations involve the m athem atical de scription of transport of 
chem ical sp ecies in a given bubble colum n reacto r that includes ch emical reaction.  
Normally, the hydrodynam ic description whic h governs the convective, diffusive and 
interfacial transport of chem ical s pecies  and heat in a reacto r, is usually m odeled 
separately, and serves as input  to the reactor m odels. According to the “level” of fluid 
dynam ic detail that they incorporate, the va rious m odels can be classfied into three 
groups.   9 
 
 In the first group, the hydrodynamic information is completely lumped into one 
parameter, which is usually the ratio of the convective and dispersion flux for each phase. 
Details of how the phases distribute and flow  are completely ignored. Among the various 
mixing models in this group, the most commonl y used one is the Axial Dispersion Model 
(ADM) where an effective axial diffusion is  considered as superimposed on the net 
convective axial flow (Zhao  et al. , 1987; Schlueter et al. , 1992; Schlueter, 1995).  
Because the ADM is suitable only for modeling of mixing processes in which the flow is 
not far away from ideal plug flow conditions, the application of such models for 
recirculation dominated convective flows, su ch as bubble column operations, is without a 
firm physical basis and results in poor  predictive capabil ities.  Degaleesan et al. (1996a) 
presented in detail the shortcomings of th e ADM applied to liquid and gas tracer data 
from a pilot-scale slurry-bubbl e column during liquid phase me thanol synthesis at the La 
Porte Alternate Fuels Development Unit (AF DU). It was shown th at the liquid phase 
dispersion coefficients fitted to the tracer re sponses, measured at various elevations, did 
not exhibit a consistent trend, and the values  were widely scattered around the estimated 
means up to ± 150%. For gas phase dispersion inve stigation, although the axial gas 
dispersion coefficient obtained by fitting tracer data at different detector levels has a 
standard deviation typically within ±22%, which is not surprising as the gas is closer to 
plug flow. However, the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient exhibits a standard 
deviation of up to ±100%. Moreover, the available correlations for axial dispersion 
coefficients (with data base acquired at at mospheric pressure operation) underpredict the 
observed liquid axial dispersion coefficien t by 150%, and overpredict the observed gas 
axial dispersion coefficient by 100% to 360%. 
Realizing the shortcomings of the ADM in th at it lacks a defini tive physical basis, 
the second group of models were  developed to predict the time-averaged fluid dynamic 
properties of these systems based on some physical picture of the observable fluid 
dynamic phenomena in bubble column reactors.   In these models, the complicated 
multiphase flow in bubble columns is often trea ted as an interconnected set of continuous 
stirred reactors (CSTR), plug flow reactors (PFR ), recycle subsystems and dead zones.    10 
 
 Between different regions of these models , convection, back mixing, cross-flow, and 
mass transfer are accounted for.  It is known that the time-averaged liquid recirculation 
flow patterns in a bubble column reactor are the result of the differences in radial 
buoyancy forces arising due to the non-uniform distribution of gas pha se in the column.  
It is this physical picture that has formed  the basis for most of the phenomenological 
mechanistic models listed in Table 2.1. 
Based on the experimental  evidence (e.g. Devanathan  et al. , 1995), it is clear that, 
beside the time averaged quantities, the transi ent behavior of flow is required to provide 
proper and needed information about the fl uid dynamics and transport parameters in 
bubble columns. The transient in formation can be obtained from experimental data or 
available correlations.  However, the ne ed for experimental data makes the 
phenomenological models unsuitable for reacto r scale-up and design, while the available 
correlations can be used confidently only with in the conditions used to generate them. 
In the third group of models, the appr opriate form of the continuity and 
momentum equations for each phase are solved.  These models are referred to as 
Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) models as they incorporate a detailed fluid 
dynamic description in prediction of scalar transport in a multiphase system.  The CFD 
models can provide either th e detailed local hydrodynamic pr operties as input to the less 
detailed models (e.g., the Recycle and Cross- Flow Model with Disp ersion Model) or the 
species transport equations can be solved within the CFD fram ework in a coupled manner.  
However, in practical reaction systems, this means the solution of additional 20-30 scalar 
transport equations which is computationall y much expensive and sometimes cannot be 
achieved in a realistic time-frame. Moreover,  the highly non-linear reaction rate (scalar 
source term) could make such scalar transport equation less stable.  Therefore, in most 
current applications CFD bubble column models  are mainly used to provide the needed 
fluid dynamics parameters for simpler models describing species transport.

 The need to establish a rational basis for the interpre tation of  the in teraction  of 
fluid dynamic variables has been the prim ary m otivation for active research in the area of 
bubble column m odeling based on com putational fluid dynam ics (CFD).  During the last 
several years the dynamic sim ulation of gas-liq uid flow in bubble colu mn reactors has 
drawn considerable attention of the inves tigators in the chemical reaction engin eering 
community (Sokolichin and Eigenberger,  1994; Kuipers and Swaaij, 1998; Pan  et al. , 
2000). 
The two-phase gas-liquid flow in bubble colum ns is typically  buoyancy driven.  A 
number of CFD m odeling st udies of two-phase bubble co lumn flows have been 
perform ed since the 1980’s, when the genera l advancem ent in num erical sim ulation and 
substantial increase in com putational power be came available. However, real progress in 
bubble column CFD m odeling has occurred after 1990 (See Ta ble 2.2). Various m ethods 
are available for the simulation of dispers ed two-phase flows.  They r ange from  model-
free direct num erical sim ulations (DNS) to continuum -based models requiring a 
considerable num ber of closure relationships.

 2.1 Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) 
The best way of dealing with the presen ce of a broad range of spatial and time 
scales is to resolve them in  full spectrum.  For bubbly flow, this means to solve the three-
dimensional time dependent flow field descri bed by the Navier-Stokes equations both in 
the carrier fluid and inside the bubbles.  DNS is model free and describes the full physics 
of the flow problem under i nvestigation. Special algorithms are necessary to track the 
fluid interface and very fine meshing is n eeded to capture all time and length scales. 
The oldest and most popular approach is to capture the front dividing the phases 
directly on a fixed grid.  The Volume-Of- Fluid (VOF) method (Hir t and Nichols, 1981), 
where a marker function was used to identify each fluid, is the best-known example.  A 
number of developments, including a techni que to include surface tension (Brackbill  et 
al., 1992), the use of “level sets” (Sussman  et al. , 1994), the Constrained Interpolation 
Profile (CIP) method (Yabe, 1997) and pha se field method (Jacqmin, 1999) have 
increased the accuracy of this approach.  Fo r details, one should consult the review by 
Scardovelli and Zaleski (1999) which provides a list of refe rences concerning the VOF 
method. 
The second approach in front tracking is a method with a separate front marking 
the interface but a fixed grid, wh ich is only modified near the front to make the grid line 
follow the interface, is used for the fluid with in each phase.  The original front tracking 
method was proposed by Unverdi and Tryggva son (1992).  Several improvements and 
modifications were made during the last  decade.  Esmaeeli and Tryggvason (1996) 
simulated the motion of a few hundred tw o-dimensional bubbles at small Reynolds 
number, 1-2, and found an inve rse energy cascade similar to what is seen in the two-
dimensional turbulence.  They also looked at  another case where th e Reynolds number is 
20-30 (Esmaeeli and Tryggvason, 1999).  Bunner and Tryggvason (1999) used a parallel 
version of this method to investigate th e dynamics of two hundred freely moving three-
dimensional bubbles with gas volume fraction up to 6%.   16 
 
 The third approach is a Lagrangian m ethod whe re the grid follows the fluid (see 
e.g. Johnson and Tezduyar, 1997) and the fourth approach us es separate, boundary fitted  
grids for each phase (see e.g. Takagi and Ma tsum oto, 1996).  This last m ethod is the most 
accurate an d com putationally expensive.  Fo r details, one should consult the rev iew by 
Crowe  et al.  (1996) that contains a li st of references concerni ng applications of DNS in 
two phase flows. 
DNS can be used to obtain a wealth of inform ation such as bubble motion, 
dispersion and turbulent statistics as seen  by the bubble which enrich the understanding 
of this two phase flow.  It can also be used to test the clos ures that are needed for the 
macro-scale m odels (e.g., two-fluid m odel). In general, DNS is extensively used in 
simulation of single bubble (Figure 2.1) or bubbl e cluster (F igure 2.2) flows in confi ned 
small dom ains, frequently with periodi c boundary conditions. Due to the excessive 
computational cost, DNS is lim ited to low Reynolds num bers and few bubbles, m aking it 
unsuitab le for most real applic ation s.

Our f ocus is on m odels tha t can,  at pr esent,  sim ulate the  flow in th e whole 
colum n.  Moreover, we are cognizant of th e fact that the dem ands for high volumetric 
productivity are forcing industrial operations  to abandon the bubble flow regim e (see 
Figure 2.3a) and operate increasingly at hi gh gas velocities a nd high gas holdups (in 
excess of 30%) in the churn turbulent regim e (Figure 2.3b).  Figur e 2.3, taken in our 
laboratory in a 2D Plexiglas column with ai r bubbles sparged through water, illustrates 
qualitatively the key differences between the two regim es. While in bubbly flow (Figure 
2.3a) one indeed has the gas phase in the form  of individual bubbles, narrowly distributed 
around som e mean diam eter, in churn turbul ent flow (F igure 2.3b) also clusters and 
"large" irregular shape bubbles appear.

To handle the com plex gas-liquid flows in practical applic ations, different 
averag ing techniques, such as ens emble, pha se, and tim e averaging, have been used 
(Drew  et al. , 1979; Drew, 1983; Zhang and Prosperetti, 1994; 1997 and Drew and 
Passm ann, 1999), to derive the governing equa tions. Sim ilarly, num erous studies have 
been devoted to m odel the in terfacial exchange phenom ena (Biesheuvel and Spoelstra, 
1989; Drew and Lahey, 1987; Tom iyama et al. , 1995a) and turbulence (Abou-Arab, 1986; 
Elghobashi and Abou-Arab, 1983; Sato  et a l., 1981a; b and Jakobsen, 1993) in these 
flows. These fluid dynam ic models capable of  describing multi-phase flows in the whole 
colum n can be d ivided  into  Eule r-Euler, Eu ler-Lagrangian or m ixture type of models 
(which is simplified Euler-Euler m odel) de pending on how the dispersed phase is treated. 
These approaches have their own adva ntages and disadvantages and one can 
choose one of the m depending on the flow situ ation at hand and the desired objectives. In 
the following sections, we briefly discuss these approaches. 
   19 
 
 2.2 Euler-Lagrangi an Method 
In this approach, a single se t of conservation equations is solved for a continuous 
phase, while the dispersed phase is instead tr eated as discrete bubbles or clusters of  
bubbles and is explicitly tracked by solvin g an appropriate equa tion of m otion in the 
Lagrangian fra me of reference through the c ontinuous (carrier) phase flow field (Figure 
2.4).  The interaction between the continuous and the dispersed phase can be taken into 
account with separate models for drag, lift, virtual m ass, and the Basset history forces.

equations can be written as:

 where 1α,1ρ,  are volum e fraction, density, and ve locity vector of the continuous 
phase, respectively.  p is the pressur e, 1u
1τ is the stress tensor, g is the acceleration due to  
gravity.  The stress tensor can be defined as: 
() ()T
11 1 12
3µ⎡⎤=∇+∇−∇⎢⎥⎣⎦1uu I ui τ   (2.3) 
where 1µ is the continuous phase molecular viscosity. In Equation (2.2), the term   
represents the (interfacial) m omentum  (e.g., drag force, virtual m ass, and lift forces) 
transferred to the continuous phase due to th e move ment of dispersed phase particles.  
Depending on the size and concen tration of dispersed phase particles, th ree d ifferent 
levels of coupling between the phases need to be described: 12F
 
2.2.1 One-w ay coupling 
When dispersed phase particles are very small in size and low in conc entra tion, 
one-way coupling prevails between  the phases (Johansen, 1990; W ebb et a l., 1992). In 
this c ase, it is assum ed that the movem ent of the dispersed phase particles does not 
change the flow field of the continuous phase (i.e., 0=12
0F ); therefore, the flow field of 
the continuous phase can be obtained independent of the motion of the dispersed phase 
particle s. 
 
2.2.2 Two-way coupling 
For m oderate size and /or concentration of  particles, a two-way coupling (Lapin 
and Lübbert, 1994b; Lain  et al. , 1999; Delnoij  et al. , 1999) prevails between the phases in 
which the effects of dis persed phase m ovement on the continuous phase flow field and 
vice versa are taken into account (i.e., ≠12F ). 
 
 
   21 
 
 2.2.3 Four-w ay coupling 
When particle concentration is signif icantly high, in addition to the two-way 
coupling, one needs to includ e the m omentum  exchange between the particles via 
particle-particle collis ions. This is called f our-way coupling (Hoom ans et al. , 1996; 
Delnoij  et al. , 1997b; Hoom ans, 2000) and will not be discu ssed here further as it mainly  
used in gas-solid or liquid- solid flow investigations. 
The m otion of gas bubbles can genera lly be for mulated based on Newton’s 
second law as (Johansen, 1990):

As turbulence description in the continuous phase by either a kε− or an RSM 
model only leads to averaged velocity and tu rbulence s tatistics, while the equation  of 
motion requires the instantaneous velocity of the continuous phase at bubble position, 
some assumptions have to be m ade to genera te the ins tantaneous value s from its mean.  
Three m ethods are typically em ployed in th e Euler-Lagrangian a pproach (Lathouwers, 
1999): discrete random  walk, continuous random  walk and models based on the Langevin 
equation (make use of a Lagrangian stocha stic differential equation to com pute the 
fluctuation a nd the m ean velocity tog ether). 
The dyna mic modeling of bubble colum n flows using the Euler-L agrangian 
approach has contributed a great deal to the improvem ent of funda mental understanding 
of these flows. Many authors (e.g., Johansen  et al. , 1987; Johansen and Boysan, 1988;    22 
 
 Johansen, 1990; W ebb et al. , 1992; Lapin and Lübbert, 1994b; Delnoij  et a l., 1997a; 
Delnoij  et al. , 1997b; Delnoij  et al. , 1997c; Delnoij  et al. , 1999; L ain et a l., 1999; 
Borchers  et al. , 1999; Lapin  et al. , 2001; Lapin  et al. , 2002) use the Euler-Lagrangian 
approach to study the dynam ics of bubble colum n flows in 2D and/or 3D system s.  All of 
these studies assum e a pseudo-continuous carri er phase flow in wh ich discrete bubbles 
are tracked by solving their e quations of m otion. The interac tions between the carrier and 
the discrete phase are taken into  account with separate m odels for drag, lift, virtual mass, 
buoyancy and the Basset history term s. The tur bulence in the carrier fluid is usually 
modeled using the kε− model.  Depending upon flow condition s, one-way or two-way 
coupling between the phases were employe d but no bubble breakup or coalescence was  
considered as only low g as holdup co nditions (<3  %) were s tudied.

 Delnoij  et al.  (1997a; 1997b), via 2D sim ulations  of a locally aerated bubble 
colum n, found: (a) a transition in the flow  pattern from  ‘cooling tower’ m ode of 
circu lation ( 1.0 LD= ) to the staggered vortice s mode of circulation ( 2.0 LD≥ ), (b) a 
stationary mode of staggered vortices for 2.0 4.8 LD<<  where the vo rtices do  not 
move downwards along the wall, (c) a dyn amic m ode of staggered vortices for 
4.8 7.7 LD<< , where the staggered v ortices m ove downwards and form  a meandering 
bubble plum e, and (d) a flow structure consis ting of two different regions where in the  
lower region, the dynam ic staggered vortices  form a bubble plum e while in the upper 
region bubbles disperse uniform ly (i.e., no bubble plum e, see Figur e 2.5) over the cross 
section without any vortices for 7.7 LD>
k.  Delnoij et al. (1999) extended their previous 
model (Deln oij et al. , 1997a) to 3D sim ulations and obtai ned the sam e conclusions as in 
2D sim ulations regarding the absence of the bubble plum e in the upper region of the 
colum n.  However, Chen et al . (1989) investigated experi mentally tw o different 2D-
rectangular bubble columns (Column A: width=760 mm, depth= 50 mm; Column B:  
width=175 mm, depth=15 mm , both operated at a superficial gas velocity of 0.35 cm /s) 
the effect of the L/D ratio ( L/D ratio from 0.5 t o 11.4) and reported the presence of the 
bubble plum e in the upper region of the colum n. 
Lain et al.  (1999) presented an experim ental and num erical study of the 
hydrodynamics in a cylindrical bubble colum n (L/D = 65cm /14cm = 4.6) using phase-
Doppler anemom etry (PDA) and dynam ic Eule r-Lagrangian sim ulations coupled with a 
modified ε− model to inco rporate the effect of bubbles on the turbulence field.  They 
reported that the bubble size distribution m ust be considered for predicting the non-
isotropy in the fluctuating m otion of the bubbles , and that for the prediction of the bubble 
induced turbulence appropriate source term s, which also account for the wake effects, 
should be incorporated in the turbulence m odel.   24 
 
 Recently, L apin et al. (2002) and Michele and He mpel∗ (2002) studied the effect 
of the ring-sparger on th e hydrodynam ics of a bubble co lumn.  The experim ental 
observations (Lapin  et al. , 2001; Michele and Hem pel, 2002) confirm  the numerical 
predic tions ( Lapin et al. , 2002; Michele and Hempel, 2002 ) that the long tim e-averaged 
flow pattern in a slender bubble column ( L/D ≈ 8)  equipped with a ring-sparger  exhibits 
a two-loop behavior in  both bubbly flow (Lapin  et a l., 2002) and churn-turbulent flow 
regim e (Michele and Hempel, 2002).  In other words, the m ean flow rises close to the 
wall in the lower part of the colum n and consequently com es dow n in the core region, 
while th e flow struc ture has it s usual pattern of up flow in  the center and down flow near 
the walls in the upper region.

 5%gThe Euler-Lagrangian m ethod is quite su itable for fundam ental investigations 
since it allows for direct c onsideration of various effect s related to bubble-bubble and 
bubble-liquid interactions.  Another advantage of  the Euler-Lagrangian m ethod is that it 
allows for easy im plementation via an exte nsion of an existing single-phase sim ulation 
code.  Moreover, incorporati on of arbitrary distribution of bubble properties is easy. As  
illustrated e arlier, the E uler-L agran gian m ethod is genera lly used in investig ation of  lab-
scale bubbly flow (Figure 2.3a) or single bubble plum e (Figure 2.6). Th e applicability of 
this m ethod is lim ited to the s ituations where the gas superfic ial velocity and gas holdup 
are rela tively low ( α< ) and the num ber of bubbles  is lim ited to 100,000. The 
required computational power is not only dictat ed by the spatia l mesh resolution bu t also 
by the num ber of bubbles that are tracked.  Fo r dynam ic calculations, tracking all bubbles 
soon becomes infeasible as the gas volum e fract ion, and the num ber of bubbles, increases.  
A possible sim plification has been intr oduced by Lapin and Lübbert (1994b) where 
instead of following individual bubbles, groups of bubbles with  similar characteristics, 
called clusters, are track ed. Each cluster is  characterized  by a dens ity function. In their 
model, the bubble clusters are c onsidered to have a velocity that is the sum  of the liquid 
velocity, the slip velocity, and a random  contribution m odeled by a Monte Carlo m ethod. 
They found that no steady-state could be obtai ned and only the long time average for the 
liquid flow field exhibited a si ngle circulation zone. Howeve r, in chu rn turbulent f low 
regim e, the bubbles differ in shape and size si gnificantly and they interact, breakup and 
coalesce frequently, such that the clus ter-tracking concept is no longer valid. 
 
2.3 Euler-Euler (Two-Fluid) Approach 
In this approach, both the continuous a nd dispersed phases are considered to b e 
interpenetrating continua. The two-fl uid m odel is developed to describe the m otion for 
each phase in a m acroscopic s ense.  From  the m athem atical point of view, the 
macroscopic description of both phases is  derived by ensem ble averaging the 
funda mental m icroscopic conservation equa tions for each  phase, as shown by Drew   26 
 
 (1983) and Drew and Passm ann (1999).  The flow descripti on consists of differential 
equation s describ ing th e conservation of m ass, m omentum and en ergy for each  phase 
separately.  The m ass ba lance is given by (in absence of interphase exchange):

corresponding m omentum equations for the two phases can be written as:

where k=1 for continuous phase and k=2 for dispersed phase. τ is the ef fective stres s

contributions from  the cross-correlations betw een velocity fluctuations arising from  the 
averaging, is the inte rfacial f orce, which exp licitly contains the m ean interac tion 
between the phases and accounts f or the effects of two-way coupling, and exchan ge F
αρg is the 
gravity force. Due to  the loss  of infor mation in th e ens emble averaging pro cess, in 
Equation (2.7) the interfacial m omentum  exchange term , F , needs to b e closed in 
terms of known variables. Several challengi ng issues regarding the m odeling of averaged 
equations and closure relations, which have been  the active research top ic in the field of 
multiphase flow for many years, still exist.  One key question is how  to model the inter-
phase m omentum  exchange. This is related to  the problem  of calculating  the force acting 
on the bubble and taking into account the e ffect of multi-bubble interaction, large 
defor mable bubbles of the disper sed phase and f inite value of  gas holdup on these forces.  
Another unresolved issue is m odeling of turbulence in two-phase flow. exchan ge
In m ost industrial applications, high gas s uperficial velocity is used which results 
in heterogeneous flow regim e, i.e., the so-c alled churn turbulent flows.  Under such   27 
 
 conditions Euler-Euler m ethod is usually pref erred. As stated above, in the Euler-E uler 
approach th e inform ation regarding  the m icroscopic s cale has been lo st leading to the 
closure problem  which is the key issue of the Eulerian two-fluid m odel.  One of  the m ain 
objectives of this work  is to take the bubble-bubble inte raction effect in to account and 
implem ent it into th e CFD f ramework to pred ict the loc al bubble size (o r interfacial area) 
and im prove the gas holdup prediction with the help of the bubble population balance 
equation. 
 
2.4 Algebraic Slip Mixture Model (ASMM) 
Like the Euler-Euler approach, the alge braic slip m ixture m odel assum es the  
phases to b e com pletely interpene trating an d allows the phases to move at different 
velocities. However, unlike the Euler-Euler m odel, the m ixture m odel does not solve the 
mass and th e momentum  balance equations  for each phase, but only  for the m ixture phase.  
The continuity and the mom entum  equations for the m ixture phase, show n below, can be 
obtained by summing together the correspondin g equations for the constituent phases.

velocities for liquid ( ) and gas phases ( kl= kg=) with respec t to the m ass center,  
respectively.  
The diffusion stress, Dmτ, which originates because of the relative slip betw een 
the two phases, requires closure in  term s of the diffusion velocity u of each phase (or, 
equivalently , the dr ift or the slip  velocity  between the  phases). In the  ASMM, this is 
supplied by assum ing that the phases are in local equilibrium  over short spatial length 
scales.  This im plies that th e accelerating dispersed ph ase particles (b ubbles) attain the 
terminal velocity after traveling a d istance wh ich is m uch sm aller than the system  length  
scale. In other words, the dispersed phase entity (bubble, particle ) always slips with

The diffusion stress term Dmτ is also the only term in which the phase volum e

 It should be noted that in order to a pply the mixture m odel, the bubble has to 
reach the term inal velocity in a short p eriod of tim e com pared to the tim e scale  
characterizing the flow.  In reality, h owever,  it has been shown ASMM behaves well far 
outside its lim itations and pr edict flow f ield equally well with Eu ler-Eu ler m odel

2.5 Interfacial Force 
The Euler-Lagrangian,  the Euler-Euler  and the ASMM approaches require 
additional models to describe the interac tion between the continuous and the dispersed 
phases. The forces acting on a m otionless bubbl e in a s tagnant liqu id are pres sure and 
gravity. Since there is usually a relative motion between the bubble and liquid, the liquid 
flow around individual bubbles le ads to local variations in  pressure producing a shear 
stress. A bubble surrounded by a flowing liquid is exposed to a num ber of forces, which 
act on it th rough the traction at th e gas-li quid interface (Zhang and Pro speretti, 199 7; 
Drew and Passm ann, 1999). If th e slip velocity is  constant, the force acting due to the 
relative m otion is only the frictional drag fo rce. If, however, the m otion is non-uniform 
one needs  to extend  the concep t of the in terfacial force to inc lude in  addition to  the 
friction  drag , the virtual m ass and th e lateral lift forces. In o rder to calc ulate  the Basset 
force, one needs bubble trajectory which is not available in Euler-Euler or A SMM 
approaches. Moreover, the m agnitude of Basset force is about ()0.5
lgρρ  times lower 
than virtual m ass force (Chung and Troutt, 1988).  Thus Basset force can be neglected i n 
gas-liquid flow.  
 
2.5.1 Drag Force 
So far investigations of dispersed gas- liquid flows in bubble colum ns have been 
perform ed by m odeling the generalized or total drag force as a linear co mbination o f its 
various components. This linear  combination has widely been  used by all researchers.   31 
 
 DfDrew and Passm ann (1999) presented the theoreti cal analysis of the c onstitutive relations 
for the interfacial m omentum  transfer and show ed the validity of the above-m entioned 
linea r com bination in the lim it of dilute su spensions. But there is  no theoretical study 
proving the applicability of th e lin ear com bination  to cases where th e suspens ion is 
dense. All studies reported in the literature,  dealing with the m odeling of bubbly flow as  
well as the churn-turbulent flow regim es, use the linear com bination. The forces assum ed 
to be im portant for the dispersed flow in bubbl e colum ns are: the steady interfacial drag 
force, the added/virtual m ass force, the tran sversal lif t forces, the Bas set force and  the 
interfacial m ass transfer rate. These f orces are discussed in the following sections.

The drag force for a single bubble depends  on the size and the shape of the bubble, 
and the natu re of the gas -liquid interface. Fo r a swarm of bubbles, th e form ulation of the

are N bubbles in a bubble colum n, then the drag force, based on sim ple geom etric

Equation (2.24) im plicitly assum es that  bubbles do not intera ct (absence of bubble  
coales cence and breaku p) with each other but th ey m ove r ather as independent entities. 
Moreover, to estim ate F D using Equation (2.24), the knowledge of bubble diam eter d is   33 
 
 needed. In most of the repor ted studies (Jakobsen, 1993, Jakobsen  et al. , 1997, Johansen, 
1990, Kuipers and Swaaij, 1998, Lapin and Lübbert, 1994a, Lapin  et al. , 2002, Oey  et al., 
2001, Pan  et al. , 1999, Pfleger  et a l., 1999, Pfleger and Becker, 2001, Ranade and Van 
der Akker, 1994, etc.), the value of ‘ d’ is taken as ‘the m ean bubble size’ . For bubble 
colum ns operated at low gas superficial ve locities (< 3 cm /s), where  the bubble size 
distribution rem ains narrow, the concept of  mean bubble size m ay work. However, at  
high gas superficial velocities, which is the ca se in m ost of the industrial applications, 
bubble breakup and coalescence phenom ena pr evail,  resulting in a broad distribution of 
bubble sizes. Approxim ating the representative bubble size by  a single mean bubble size 
may not be adequate in this case.  Therefore, it is necess ary to take into consideration  the 
effect of bubble breakup and coalescence phe nomena and of bubble size distribution on 
the hydrodynam ics in order to be able to sim ulate the flow correctly, which is one of  the 
major objectives of this research.  
The coefficient DC appearing in Equations (2.24) is called the drag coefficient. Its 
value is likely to be different for a single bubble and a bubble swarm . This is because the 
shape and s ize of a bub ble in  a bub ble swarm  is much different than that of an is olated 
bubble. Moreover, bubble-bubble  interaction and gas holdup may alter the num erical 
value of the coefficient from  that of single bubble as the flow structure of the liquid 
surrounding a bubble gets m odified when the bubble becomes part of the swarm . There 
are several em pirical and sem i-empirical co rrelations ava ilable in the litera ture f or the  
estim ation of the drag  coefficient DC, which can be found in the recent review by 
Rafique  et al.  (2004). In this s tudy, the drag  coefficient suggested by Schiller and 
Naum ann (1935) was used, and it can be given as:

> ⎪⎩ (2.25) 
There are several drag coefficient correlations  for gas-liquid system  (e.g. Ishii and Zuber, 
1979; Tsuchiya  et al. , 1997) developed from  single bubble rising in quiescent liquid or in 
dilute bubbly flows. However, if they are a pplied to churn-turbulent flow regim e, these   34 
 
 correlations significantly overestim ate drag  coefficient.  The drag  reduction  factor 
correlation is not y et availab le and one has to m anually adjust this f actor or  artificially 
increases the bubble size. For exam ple, when T suchiya  et al.’s (1997) correlation is used 
to calculate the drag force, the m ean bubble size is increased to 3.2 cm  to fit the liquid 
axial velo city profile in  a 44-cm  diam eter air-water co lumn operated at 10 cm/sgU=  
(Pan and Dudukovic, 2000). 
The drag force accounts for the interact ion between the liquid and bubbles in a 
uniform  flow field und er non -accelerating c onditions.  If, h owever, th e flow conditions  
are not unif orm, or the flow field surroundi ng a bubble is accelerating /decelerating , then 
additional f orces act on the bubble, which can be lum ped as non-drag forces. These 
forces are d iscussed in th e following sections. 
 
2.5.2 Added/virtual mass fo rce 
When a bubble m oves in a liquid field with a non-uniform  velocity, it accelerates 
some of the liquid in its neighborhood. Due to the acceleration induced by the bubble  
motion, the surrounding liquid expe riences an extra force, whic h is due to the m otion in a 
non-inertial fra me of referen ce, called virtual or added m ass force (Figure 2.8). It should 
be em phasized that although a bubble m oving with  a constant term inal velocity also 
accelerates som e liquid in its neig hborhood b ut this does not result in a virtual m ass 
force. The concept of the added m ass force can be understood by cons idering the change 
in the k inetic energy of a fluid surro unding an  accelerating sphere. In  potential flow the 
acceleration  induces a resisting force on the sphere equal to one-half the m ass of the 
displaced fluid tim es th e accele ration of the sphere. Drew et al.  (1979) and Drew  and 
Lahey (1987) studied the necessary condition fo r the requ irement of fra me indifference of 
the cons titutive equation s and, by ap plying th e principle of o bjectivity, d erived the virtual  
mass force as: 
1 2

 The coefficient  is the virtual m ass coefficient an d it correspo nds to the v olume 
fraction of liquid that is accelerated with th e bubble. This co efficient is g enerally bub ble-
shape and gas holdup dependent. VC
 
Figure 2.8 Added/virtual m ass force for a single bubble 
 
In the case of gas-liquid flows, the infl uence of the steady  state drag force is  
predom inant as com pared to the v irtual m ass force, inclusion  of the virtu al mass effect is  
necessary to predict corr ect hydrodynam ics (Mudde and Sim onin, 1999). Mudde and 
Simonin (1999), via 3D sim ulations using the kε− model, showed that the use of only 
drag force as an interfacial m omentum excha nge source resulted in an under-prediction of 
the am plitude and freq uency of th e bubble plum e oscillations. However, when the drag  
and the virtual m ass forces were used togeth er, the va lues o f the am plitude and th e time 
period are satisfactorily com parable with th e experim ental observa tions. Recently, using 
a different code than M udde and Sim onin (1999), Oey  et al.  (2003) investigated the  
influence of interfacial closures and num erics on the hydrodynam ics of the sam e bubble 
colum n, but they could not reproduce the resu lts of Mudde and Si monin (1999). However,   36 
 
 they found the right magnitude of the oscillat ions of meandering pl ume without using the 
virtual mass. 
In this work, the virtual mass force was neglected in our CFD simulation because 
of two reasons: 1) virtual mass was neglected by most authors or  found to be negligible in 
Euler-Euler simulation, and 2) in the churn-turbulent flow regime, large bubbles do not 
have a closed wake and the concept of  added mass is not applicable (Krishna  et al., 
2001b). 
 
2.5.3 Transversal or Lateral force 
The physical phenomena giving rise to a transversal or lift force on a single 
bubble in liquids can roughly be divided in to three groups. The Magnus lift force, 
originally described by Magnus (1853), is due to bubble rotation in a uniform flow field. 
Swanson (1961) attributed the origin of this force to an asymmetric pressure distribution 
around the bubble caused by the bub ble rotation, as depicted sc hematically in Figure 2.9. 
It was observed that the lift force on a sphere could act in the opposite direction of 
the standard Magnus force at high Reynolds nu mbers due to the transition from laminar 
to turbulent boundary laye rs on two sides of the sphere as shown in Figu re 2.9b (Krahn, 
1956; Taneda, 1957). A second lift  force, the Saffman force,  acts on non-rotating bodies 
due to shear in the continuous phase flow pa ttern as depicted in Figure 2.9c (Saffman, 
1965; Stone, 2000). Saffman (1965) showed th at at low Reynolds numbers, unless the 
rotating speed of the particle was much larger than the rate of shear, the lateral force due 
to shear would be an order of magnitude la rger than the force due to rotation. At 
intermediate to high Reynolds  numbers, as in bubble column flows, only very idealized 
models of these forces, based on potential theo ry, have been presen ted (Kariysaki, 1987). 
The tendency for bubbles to deform under va rious flow conditions allows for yet 
another lift force as depicted in Figure  2.9d. Kariysaki (1987) observed a lift force on 
deformable particles of the oppos ite sign to that on rigid sphe res under linear  shear flow.   37 
 
 Similarly, Sankaranarayanan and Sundare san (2002) perform ed la ttice Boltzm ann 
simulations of bubbly suspension consisting of defor mable ellipsoidal  bubbles and found 
a sign reversal. In a paper by Tomiyam a et al.  (1995b), this force was expressed as a 
transversal force caused by a slanted wake behind a dist orted bubble in a shear field.

 u2.5.3.1  Magnus force 
The Magnus force is purely related to the transversal force acting on rotating 
bodies. Placed in a unif orm flow fi eld, the partic le rotation results in an increase in the 
velocity on one side and a decrease on the othe r side. This gives rise to an asymme tric 
pressure distribution around the particle. R ubinow and Keller (196 1) showed that a 
spinning sphere m oving in a viscous fluid expe riences a force ortho gonal to its dire ction 
of motion, a lift force. They studied th e flow about a sphere of radius r 2, spinning with an 
angular velocity Ω and moving through an unbounded statio nary fluid with a velocity u 2. 
For sm all values of the particle Reynolds number (<1), they f ound that the sphere would 
experience a lift force given by: 
3
12 2 L rπρ=Ω× F   (2.27) 
This force acts in the sam e direc tion as the classical Magnus force. 
In a heterogeneous (churn-turbulent) regi me, gas bubbles appear to m ove towards 
the co lumn center while ris ing upw ards. Tzeng  et al. (1993) observed such m otion of 
bubbles away from  walls. According to Svendsen et al. (1992), this radi al force arises 
due to a number of phenom ena such as bubbl e rotation around its ow n axis (Magnus lift 
force), relative gas-liquid velocity and a liqui d velocity gradient, viscous and turbulent 
shear gradients around the bubbles, radial pressu re gradients, bubble shape changes, wake  
phenom ena and coalescence tendency. There have been a num ber of investigations 
(Krahn, 1956; Taneda, 1957; Swanson, 1961; S vendsen  et al. , 1992; T zeng  et al. , 1993) 
regarding the origin of this force. Swanson ( 1961) attributed this force to an asymm etric 
pressure distribution around the bubble crea ted by the interaction of the bubble motion 
with the flow field. He concluded that the transversal force on bubbles acts towards the 
regions of high speed if the bubble moves agains t the liquid flow or m oves with the flow 
but slower than the flo w. The force acts to wards the low speed r egions if the bubble 
moves with the f low and f aster tha n the f low. However, as already m entioned, Taneda 
(1957) observed experim entally that in cert ain ranges of Reynolds number and rotation 
speed, rotating spheres in a uniform flow fi eld e xperien ce a lift fo rce having a direction   39 
 
 opposite to that of the Magnus force. It was c oncluded that this effect could be explained 
by a transition of the boundary layer from  laminar to turbulent. Both the direction and the 
magnitude of  this f orce depend on the loc al flow condition s such that u sing m ean values  
of the force coefficient m ay be highly m isleading. 
 
2.5.3.2  Saffman fo rce 
As described by Lahey (1990) and Ja kobsen (1993), a non ro tating particle 
experiences  a  similar lateral force when placed in a shear fl ow field. A rigid sphere in 
shear flow experiences forces that move the particle  normal to the f low direction.  The 
Magnus force is thus not the only m echanis m responsible for lateral m ovement of 
particles. Saffman (1965) com puted the lift fo rce on a particle in shear flow. He showed 
that at low Reynolds numbers, unless the rotating sp eed of the particle was m uch larger 
than the  rate of shear, th e latera l force due to  shear is an order of magnitude larg er than 
the force due to rotation.  
The transverse lift force on a spherical ga s bubble created by gradients in relative 
velocity across the bubble diam eter was derived by Thom as et al.  (1983).

Thomas et al.  (1983), Drew (1983), Drew and Lahey (1987) and D rew and 
Passm ann (1999) assigned the force coefficient as CL = 0.5 for spherical particles in 
potential flow. However, the value varies, and for viscous flow, Lahey (1990) reports 
values as sm all as 0.01. Sankaranarayanan and Sundaresan (2002) investigated, through 
Lattice Boltzm ann si mulation, the lift force in bubbly suspensions and reports the lift 
force coefficient is not only re lated to the bubble diam eter, but also the shear stress in 
which the bubble is imm erged. Moreover, negativ e lift force coefficient is found for large 
bubbles and in strong shear fields. T omiyama et al.  (2002) analyzed, both experim entally 
and through Euler-Lagrange sim ulations, the transverse m igration of single bubbles in   40 
 
 L simple shear flows. They found that the lift coefficient C for small bubbles (0-4 mm) is 
a function of bubble Reynolds number Re, whereas the coefficient for larger bub bles 
correlates w ell with a m odified Eötvös num ber which em ploys the m aximum horizontal  
dimension of a defor med bubble  as a characte ristic length. It should be noted that 
Equation (2.28) im plicitly assu mes that the bubble velocity vector and the flow field 
velocity vector are collinear. However, in general three-dim ensiona l flow fields, these 
may not be collinear. Schrage et al. (2001) have derived analytically a generalized form 
of the lift force for three-dim ensional flow fields. Their study assum es a tim e-
independent inviscid flow field surrounding a bubble and c onceptually cl eaves the bubble 
into two halves along the plan e of the im pinging flow field velocity (see Figure 2.10), 
such that each half-bubble resides in a flow fi eld of a slightly differe nt velocity. In their 
analysis, the presence of the bubble in the flow field is conceptualized as a sm all 
perturbation to the far-field flow dynam ics. 
Schrage et al.  (2001) integrated the Euler equation to derive the pressure field for 
a constant Bernoulli function. The lift for ce acting on a bubble is calculated by the  
imbalance of kinetic energy a nd co nvectiv e potentia l of the respec tive halves and it is 
shown that the lift force acts from  lower velo city region s tow ards h igher velocity regions 
(from  the lower half towards the upper half in Figure 2.10). 
It should be noted that, in the Euler- Euler fram ework, both Magnus and Saffman 
forces attain an identical m athematical fo rm so that respective co efficients b ecome 
additive. Most of the resear chers (Torvik, 1990; Svendsen  et al. , 1992; Becker  et al. , 
1994; Sokolichin and E igenberger, 1994; Lain  et al. , 1999; Jakobsen, 2001) used C L~0.5.

In the case of 2D si mulations, two types of m ethodologi es are usually applied. In 
the f irst case, all the  derivatives in the th ird direction appearing in the conservation 
equation s are identically  set to zero and the equations are s olved in 2D space (say x-y 
plane). In the second case, an arbitrary unit length in the th ird direction is assum ed and 
the der ivatives with re spect to th e third d irection a re retained in the conserva tion 
equations. In the first approach, the lift fo rce as represented by Equation (2.28) becom es 
meaningless as the vorticity vector  that is pointing out of the 2D-plane is set to zer o as 
well. For such situations, Ranade (1997) pr oposed the following formulation for 2D  
simulations,

result of which the bubble m oves away from  the wall towards the zones of lower pressure. 
It should be noted that the bracketed qua ntity in Equation (2.29)  tends to zero as ‘ r’ 
approaches zero (center of the colu mn) while it is  equal to on e for  (column walls). 12wrF
In this stud y, the lif t force is negle cted as m ost authors did. The m ain reason is 
that the lift force due to bubble deform ation in strong shear flow fields, which is the most 
important a nd relev ant later al force in gas- liquid flow, has not been well m odeled and is  
not available even for single bubble. Another re ason is the lift force is less im portant in 
magnitude than the drag force. However, it s hould be noted that lift force com ponent in 
the horizontal plane m ay not be negligible  in la rge veloc ity gradient region. 
 
2.6 Multiphase Turbulence Modeling 
Typically, all fluctuations are filtered ou t by appl ying different averaging 
techniques i.e., Reynolds averaging, leaving a sem i-empirical analysis of the m ean 
turbulent qu antities  intended to d escribe all sc ales of m otion lum ped together in a single 
model. Most of the published research has e mployed this approach with the goal being t o 
obtain sufficient information a bout m ean turbulent quantities in a s imple and efficient 
way. 
As stated earlier, the co ntinuity and  the momentum  balance equations (E quations  
(2.5) and (2.7)) are derived using ensem ble-averaging. Theref ore, the velocity vector  u 
appearing in these equations represents an average velocity field and the phase-holdup  
α is a con tinuous f unction  in the  inter val [0, 1] . The ef fect of  fluctuations sm aller than  
the scales of averaging appears as u nclosed parts in the stre ss-ten sor an d the interf acial 
mom entum  exchange te rms. Inherently the Eule r-Euler m odel repres ents the scale s larger   43 
 
 than the length and tim e scales employed by  the ensem ble-averaging, therefore, it does 
not contain all hydrodynam ic scales present in the flow field, but ra ther the effects of 
these scales  in an averaged sense.  In prin ciple, there is no need to apply any further 
averaging, such as Reynolds averaging, to m odel the turbulence while simulating a flow 
process.  However, in industrial equipm ent simulations, the com putational dom ain can 
becom e very large, and one m ay only be interes ted in  very large  scales. Th en 
interm ediate length and  time scales  can be defined, which  are larger than the s cales 
involved in ensem ble averaging but stil l substantially sm aller than the large 
hydrodynamic scales. R eynolds aver aging practice is used to resolve only these very 
large s cales.  
The resu lting ensem ble plus Reynolds averag ed equations, in addition to proper 
means, contain further unknown covariance or correlation term s that have to be m odeled 
separately leading to the cl osure problem  once again. It s hould be noted that the unknown 
covariance term s thus appearing,  contain fluctuations with respect to en semble-averaged 
mean flow field, which does not  have its cou nterpa rt in single-phase flow problem s. 
Therefore, the closure problem  is even m ore complicated. F or details, one should consult 
the recent review by Rafique et al. (2004). 
In th is wor k for Euler -Euler m odel, turbu lence in th e liqu id phase  is modeled 
through a set of m odifi ed kε− equations with extra term s that account for interphase 
turbulent mom entum transfer (Launder and Spalding, 1974; Elghobashi and Abou-Arab, 
1983). For the dispersed gas phase, turbulence closure is effected through correlations 
from  the theory of dispersion of discrete particles by homogeneous turbulence (Tchen, 
1947). The model equations are listed in Tabl e 2.3. In ASM M, the turbulent stress term in 
the m ixture equation is closed by solving a k-ε model for the m ixture p hase. The model 
equations are listed in T able 2.4. The kε− model is availab le in F LUENT.   44

2.7 Previous Euler-Euler Investigatio ns of Bubble Co lumn Flows 
There have been num erous studies since 1990 in using the Euler-Euler approach 
to model the hydrodynam ics of lab-scale as well as pilot-scale bubble colum ns operated 
from  the bubble flow to churn-turbulent flow regim e (e.g., Torvik, 1990; Torvik and 
Svendsen, 1990; Ranade, 1992; 1997; Grie nberger and Hofm ann, 1992; Svendsen  et al. , 
1992; Jakobsen  et al. , 1993; Sokolichin and Eigenberger, 1994; 1999; Becker  et al., 1994; 
Sokolichin  et al. , 1997; Thakre and Joshi, 1999; Sanyal  et al. , 1999; Pfleger  et al. , 1999; 
Mudde and Sim onin, 1999; Oey  et al., 2001; Pan  et al., 1999; 2000; Pan and Dudukovic, 
2001; Padial  et al. , 2000; Krishna  et al. , 1999; Krishna  et al. , 2000; van-Baten and   46 
 
 Krishna, 2001; Krishna and van B aten, 2001b; Krishna  et al. , 2001a; Krishna  et al. , 
2001b; Pfleger and Becker, 2001 and Ranade and Tayalia, 2001). 
Some of t hese studies do not use a turbulence m odel in the Eu ler-Eu ler 
implementation (Sokolichin and E igenberger, 1994; 1999 and Pfleger  et al. , 1999). T hey 
found that if only the molecula r viscosity of the carrier fluid is increased 100 tim es 
(Sokolichin and Eigenberger, 1994), a good agre ement between the com puted results and 
experim ental data can be obt ained for bubbly flow in the air-water system .  Without 
increasing the viscosity, however, the dyna mic behavior can be resolved in 2D 
simulations, but the grid independent so lution cannot be obtained (Sokolichin and 
Eigenberger, 1999).  Pfleger  et al.  (1999) have shown that th e results obtained by 3D 
dynam ic simulations without a turbulence m odel exhibit a chaotic behavior, which is 
contrary to the experim ental observation where harm onic oscillations are observed.  
These observations sug gest th at the predic tion of  local tu rbulent v iscosity is one of  the 
key issue of the two-fluid m odel. 
Most of the studies, which use turbulence models to inco rporate th e turbulenc e 
induced by the dispersed phase, assum e the turbulence to be the property of the 
continuous phase and model it using the k-ε model for the liquid phase (Torvik, 1990, 
Torvik and Svendsen, 1990, Jakobsen  et al. , 1993, Sokolichin and Eigenberger, 1994, 
Sokolichin  et al. , 1997, Sokolichin and Eigenberger, 1999, Pfleger  et al., 1999, Sanyal  et 
al., 1999, Mudde and Sim onin, 1999, Krishna  et al. , 1999, Krishna  et a l., 2000, van-
Baten and Krishna, 2001, Kris hna and van Baten, 2001b, Krishna  et al., 2001a, K rishna  
et al. , 2001b, Ranade and Tayalia, 2001 and Pfleger and Becker, 2001). 
Sokolichin and Eigenberger (1994) ha ve shown, through 2D sim ulation of 
partially aerated 2D bubble colum n (i.e., colum n width and height are much larger than 
its depth) operated in bubbly flow regi me, that the use of t he single-phase kε− model 
predicts m uch higher viscosity  (5-10 tim es higher as com pared to full 3D si mulation). 
This is  an a rtifact of inappropriate  charac teristic turbu lence length  scale, and r esults in 
dampening of the transient characteristics of the flow.  This conclusion was also   47 
 
 kconfirm ed by Mudde and Sim onin ( 1999) and Pfleger  et al.  (1999).  Nevertheless, unlike 
studies which do not use  a turbulence m odel, a grid independent solution can be obtained 
on a relatively coarse m esh by using the ε− turbu lence m odel. 
Sokolichin and Eigenberger (1999), in th e case of 3D simulations using the 
single-phase kε− model, have obtained a good agreem ent with experim ents.  This leads 
to the conclusion that the 2D colum n dept h effects, which are neglected in the 2D 
simulations, have a strong influe nce on the sim ulation.  Pfleger  et al.  (1999), by 
comparing 2D and 3D simulations of a recta ngular bubble colum n, concluded that in 2D  
simulations, the length scale used by the kε− model is equal to th e colum n width, while 
in 3D sim ulations, it is equal to the colum n depth.  Due to the m uch sm aller leng th sc ale, 
the kε− model in 3D sim ulation pred icts m uch smaller viscosity and the predicted 
hydrodynamics is in better agreem ent with the experimental observations.  Hence, 
Pfleger et al. (1999) suggest that the colum n dept h must be resolved  meticulously to 
obtain accu rate hydrody namics.  M udde and Simonin (1999) perform ed 3D si mulations 
using the kε− model and have shown that when only drag force was used as an 
interfacial mom entum  source, the am plitude and tim e period of the oscillations were 
under-predicted. However, when the drag and th e virtual m ass forces were used together, 
the values of  the am plitud e and the tim e period were quite com parable with  the 
experim ental observations.  The i mportance of  the virtual m ass in mom entum exchange 
closures is not reported by other authors (e.g., Pfleger  et al. , 1999, Buwa and Ranade, 
2002). 
Sanyal  et al.  (1999) perf ormed 2D axi-symm etric sim ulations of a 19-c m diam eter 
cylindrical bubble column (air-water system  at atmospheric pressure), operated in typical 
bubbly flow ( Ug = 2 cm/s) and churn turbulent flow ( Ug = 12 cm/s) regim es. The 
numerical simulations w ere performed using the Algebraic Slip Mi xture Model (ASMM), 
and the Euler-Euler m odel.  The results are compared with experim ental data using CT 
and CARPT and a reasonably good quantitat ive agre ement is obta ined between  the 
experim ental data and simulation for the tim e-averaged gas holdup, ax ial liquid velocity   48 
 
 distribution, and the kinetic energy distribu tion.  They concluded that both the Euler-
Euler m odel and ASMM predict reality equa lly well within engineering accuracy. 
Pan et al.  (1999; 2000) used the dynam ic Euler-Euler approach with the bubble-
induced turbulence m odel (Sato  et al., 1981a; b), including drag and virtual m ass forces, 
to sim ulate a 2D rectangular bubble colu mn operating in bubbly flow regim e.  The 
computed tim e-averaged axial velo city profiles  and turbulent quantities  were com pared 
with experim ental data of Mudde  et al.  (1997b), and found in reasonable agreem ent.  
Contrary to Pfleger et al. (1999), who em phasized the im portance of resolving the thir d 
direction properly and advocated the need fo r full 3D sim ulation for 2D bubble colum n to 
acquire accurate fluid dynam ic data, Pan  et al.  (1999; 2000) only perform ed 2D 
simulations and still captured all the esse ntial fluid dynam ic features.  The m ain 
difference b etween Pfleger et al.  (1999) and Pan et al.  (1999; 2000), other than the 
simulation dim ension (3D vs. 2D), is the us e of different turbulence m odels, i.e. the kε− 
model in the for mer case and the bubble induced  turbulence model in th e later c ases.  As 
mentioned earlier, the characteri stic length scale used by the kε− model is about the 
smallest length of the ge ometry involved, which is the column depth in 2D colum n. In 2D 
simulation, the colum n depth is assum ed to be in finite such that the correct characteristic 
length scale cannot be used, which turns out to  over-predict the turbulent viscosity by 5-
10 tim es.  However, the bubble induced tu rbulence m odel, due to the right input  of the  
characteristic length scale through the assum ed bubble size, predicts the flow dyna mic 
characteristics correctly. Once an appropriate  bubble size is select ed, the bubble induced 
turbulence model can predict a correct m agnitude of turbulent viscosity and other  
hydrodynamic properties at least in the bubbly flow regime.  One ma y argue that the 
success of bubble induced turbulence m ay just be a coincidence.  However, in bubbly 
flow regim e, it is the bubble induced turbulen ce, rather th an the shear in duced turbu lence 
(kε− model), that dom inates.  In churn-turbulent flow regim e, the dom ination of the 
bubble induced turbulence m ay not be true any more.  However, as illustrated by Pan and 
Dudukovi ć (2001), the use of bubble-indu ced turbulence model (Sato  et al. , 1981a; b),   49 
 
 including drag and virtual ma ss forces, can predict well a wide range of cylindrical 
bubble column operations in bubbly flow and churn-turbulent flow regime. 
Krishna and co-workers (Krishna  et al. , 1999; Krishna  et al. , 2000; van-Baten and 
Krishna, 2001; Krishna and van Baten, 2001b; Krishna  et al. , 2001a; Krishna  et al., 
2001b) published a number of 2D-axisymmetric and 3D simulations based on the two-
bubble class concept, which suggests that in  the heterogeneous regime, the whole bubble 
size distribution consists of two classes: ‘s mall bubbles’ and ‘large bubbles’.  The large 
bubbles usually occupy the central region of the column and trav el with a velocity greater 
than the small bubbles, which occupy the regions near the walls. Both bubble classes 
interact with the cont inuous phase via drag force only, which differs for the small bubbles 
and the large bubbles.  However, Krishna a nd coworkers ignore the mutual interaction 
between the two bubble classes, thus both bubble classes are treated as  separate phases, 
i.e., the flow field in a bubbl e column can be regarded as consisting of three phases: 
liquid phase, small bubble pha se and large bubble phase. 
Krishna et al.  (1999) performed experiments a nd 2D-axisymmetric simulations, 
which show that all velocity profiles collapse to a single one if plot ted as the normalized 
velocity as a function of normalized radial distance.  Krishna et al. (2000) reconfirmed 
the widely accepted point of vi ew that azimuthally and time -averaged radial distribution 
of liquid phase axial velocity can be well predicted by 2D axi-symmetric simulation and 
due to imposition of axi-symmetric constraint , the 2D axi-symmetri c simulations cannot 
predict an accurate radial distribution of the gas holdup. The results from the 3D 
simulations do show an improvement, which is also confirmed by Ranade and Tayalia 
(2001), in the predicti on of gas holdup but th e use of single ‘mean bubble size’ still fails 
to lead to good and reliable ho ldup profile prediction.  Krishna et al. (2000) also suggest 
that the concept of ‘two-bubble cl asses’ is indeed a right dire ction but not sufficient to be 
able to predict the gas holdup profile accurately. 
Krishna  et al.  (2001a) use 2D axi-symmetric simula tions to analyze the effect of 
bubble column diameter on the hydrodynamics of bubble columns. They found that the   50 
 
 overall gas holdup decreases with  increase in colum n diameter due to the increase in the 
streng th of the liquid circulation with increa se in colum n diameter, which accelerates th e 
bubbles traveling upwards in the central core.  The qualitative trend agrees with Zehner’s 
(1989) correlation, but the quant itative com parison shows that  there is at least 50-90% 
discrepancy between the com puted  and experim ental results. 
 
 
Figure 2.11 Axial dispersion coefficien t of  the liquid phase: com parison of 
experim ental data with 2D and 3D Eulerian simulations (from  van Ba ten 
and Krishna, 2001). 
 
Van Baten and Krishna (2001) found a good agreem ent between the com puted 
velocity pr ofiles and cente rline velocity obtained from 3D si mulation and their 
experim ental data (Krishna  et a l., 1999). They also investig ated liquid phase axial 
dispersion coefficient and the e ffect of physical properties of interacting fluids (air/water 
and air/Tellus oil) by 3D num erical trace r simulations and obtained reasonably good 
comparison with experim ental data (Krishna  et al. , 1999).  It was found that the  
prediction of the liquid phase axial dispers ion coefficient vi a 2D sim ulation is about one 
order of m agnitude low er than the experim ental observations (Figure 2.11).  The authors 
also investigated the gas phase axial disper sion coefficient via 3D simulation.  They   51 
 
 kfound that the com puted dispersion coeffici ent of the large bubbles was significantly 
lower (up to 40%), and that of the sm all bubbles was alm ost the sam e as that of the liquid 
phase, which suggests the entrainment of  the sm all bubbles by the liquid phase. 
Pfleger and Becker (2001) used, for a 3D-cylindrical bubble colum n simulation, a 
modified ε− model in the liquid phase, which in corporates an additional production 
term in k and−ε− equations to include the influen ce of the dispersed phase,.  They 
concluded that the single phase kε− model is better in describing the instantaneous 
large-scale f low stru ctures and  the p rediction  of the local an d overall  gas holdup than the 
modified kε− model.  However, the incorporati on of additional term s shows a positive 
impact on the prediction of the velocity profiles and corresponding tim e-series but it 
deteriorates the local and over-all holdup pred iction.  Moreover, it was observed that as 
the grid size decreases, the agreem ent be tween predicted long tim e-averaged gas holdup 
and experimental data improve s while that b etween the ax ial ve locity and exper imental 
data deteriorates (the veloc ity profiles becom e flatter).  The reasons for such phenom ena 
have to be investigated further.

In m ost of t oday' s CFD calculations of dispersed two phase gas-liquid flows, the  
local bubble size distribution is not included. C urrently used closures for the interf acial  
mom entum  transfer term s basically rely on the em pirical correlations  for single m ean 
bubble size. The bubbles ar e assumed to have the sam e size and shape (Figure 3.1a), 
whereas in reality a wide spectrum  of bubble sizes exists (Figure 3.1b), possibly varying 
from  one point to another due to bubble-bubble  interactions, phase change and pressure 
changes. Therefore, the use of a single bubbl e size correlation m ay not be appropriate 
beyond the narrow range of operating conditions and geom etries over which it was  
determ ined. Instead, the local bubble size distri bution information (F igure 3.1c) is needed.

 The uncertainty in bubble colum n design, s cale-up and scale-down arises from  the 
lack of fundam ental unders tanding of the hydrodynam ics and rate processes which 
govern bubble size and thus interfacial ar ea per unit volum e. The local bubble size 
distribution depends on the balance of coales cence and break-up rate in  the colum n as 
well as  on pressure change, phase change an d gas-liquid m ass transf er. Because of the 
incom plete understanding of the physical mechanism s that lead to break-up and 
coales cence,  and the con siderab le difficulty in  obtaining reliable data, es pecially at h igh 
gas flow rates and holdups, no broadly applicab le model f or these proce sses in tu rbulent 
two phase gas-liquid system s has yet been fully developed. 
 
3.1 Bubble Po pulation Balance Eq uation 
In bubble colum n reactors, the initial bubb le size is determ ined by  the for mation 
of bubbles at the sparger. However, the in itial bubble size m ay not be stable due to 
turbulence,  interf acial instab ility, wake entr ainm ent, size depende nt ris e velocity  
difference and shear layer induced velocity di fference. In all these cases, the bubble size 
is further changed by a break-up and/or co alescence m echanism . In the pres ence of 
chem ical reactions,  in ad dition  to break-up a nd coalescence, m ass transfer should  also be 
considered. Phase change and pressure change  may also need to be taken into account. 
Since the interfacial area concentration changes with the variation in the bubble 
number density due to coalescen ce and break-up, it is important to be  able to  pred ict the 
local bubb le surface density.  Analogous to the Boltzm ann’s transport equatio n, a 
population balance m odel can be used to provide  a statistical form ulation in describing 
the dispersed phase in multiphase f low. Gene rally, the population balance equation can 
be expressed as:

3.2 Bubble Breakup 
The bubbles in turbulent dispersion are not only exposed to a turbulent field, but 
are also subject to both inertia l and viscous forces. Moreover,  the gas-liquid interface is 
also subject to Rayleigh-Taylor  and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabili ty due to the difference in 
density and velocity of the gas and liquid pha se. The most important force in stabilizing 
the bubble is the surface tension. In additi on, a centrifugal force, induced by internal 
circulation of the gas in a bubble, can suppress the disturbances at th e gas-liquid interface 
and act as a stabilizing force. On the ot her hand, such a centrifugal force can also 
disintegrate the bubble as it increases with an increase in bubble size.  The bubble breaks 
up when the centrifugal force exceeds the surf ace tension force, especially at high 
pressures when gas density is high. The fate of a bubble is determined by the 
breakup/deformation force and the stabilizatio n/restoration force (T able 3.1). Since the 
bubbles are much larger than the microscale  of turbulence (Shinnar, 1961; Narsimhan  et 
al., 1979), the viscous force can be neglected.

Much of the published literature on bubble break-up in turbulent flow is derived 
from Hinze (1955) which assumes that the bubble break-up o ccurs through bubble 
interactions with turbulent eddies. Only the eddies which are approx imately equal to the 
size of the bubble can br eak the bubble, since larger eddies  have the tendency to transport   56 
 
 maxdthe bubble rather than break it, while very sm all eddies do not contain sufficient energy to 
break the bubble. 
From  Equation (3.2), it is clear that for a complete bubble breakup model, the 
number of daughter bubbles produced upon br eakup of a parent bubble, the daughter 
bubble size probability  density func tion (p.d.f.) and breakup  rate need to  be provid ed. In 
addition, when a bubble exceeds a critical va lue, the bubble interf ace becom es unstable 
and breakup is likely to occur. T herefor e, the bubble breakup can be related to the 
maximum attainable size (Kocam ustafaogulla ri and Ishii, 1995) and a com plete bubble 
breakup m odel, should also include the m aximum  stable bubble size (which gives a  
threshold below which a bubble will not be brea kable in a  given turbulent flow field).  
As already stated such a com plete brea kup model m ust also specify the num ber of 
daughter bubbles generated upon breakup fr om a given parent bubble under given 
turbulent flow field, the p.d.f. of daughter bubb les (which is the pr obability distribution 
of daughter bubbles upon breakup  from  a parent bubble) a nd the breakup rate (which 
gives the number of bubbles of  given size that break per unit volum e per unit tim e) must 
be provided. 
 
3.2.1 Maximum Stable Bubble Siz e 
In turbulent flow, bubble brea kup is caused by fluctuating eddies resulting in the 
pressure variation along the bubble surface. W hen a bubble size exceeds a critical value, 
at which the breakup/def ormation m echanism  and the stabilization/restoration m echanism 
reach equilibrium , the b ubble interface becom es unstab le and br eak-up is likely to occur. 
Different expressions have been proposed to  estim ate the maxim um stable bubble size, 
, that a bubble can attain in a given fl ow field. One should note that the m aximum 
stable bubble size is not equal to the m aximum (possible) bubble size in a given system .   57 
 
 Martínez-Bazán  et a l. (1999a), based on Kolmogorov’s concept, suggested the 
following maxim um stable bubble size in turb ulent flows, which compared well with 
their experim ental data.

used by Martínez-Bazán  et a l. (1999a). In this m odel, only the dom inant forces, 
turbulence s tress and surface tension,  are cons idered. 
Lin et al.  (1998) showed that Hinze’s (1955) m ethod under-predicts the m aximum 
stable bubble size and cannot predict the obs erved effect of pr essure on bubble size. 
Grace et al. (1978) applied the Rayleigh-Taylor inst ability theory by considering the time  
available for the d isturbance to g row and the time required for the disturbance to grow to 
an adequate am plitude that  causes breakup. Batchelor ( 1987) pointed out that the 
observed m aximum stable size air bubbles in wa ter were considerably  larger than that 
predicted by  the m odel of Grace et al.  (1978). Batchelor (1987) further took in to account 
the stabilizing effects o f the liquid acceleration  along the bubble su rface and  the non-
constant growth rate of the disturbance.  In his m odel, the inf ormation regarding  the 
disturbances is required f or the pred iction of the m aximum stable bubble size. 
Kitscha and Koca mustafaogulla ri (1989) applied the Kelvin-Helm holtz instability 
theory to model the breakup of  large bubbles in liquids, usi ng the sam e concept as Grace 
et al. (1978).  W ilkinson and van Di erendonck ( 1990) applied the critical wavelength to 
explain the m aximum stable bubb le size in high-pressure bu bble colum ns.  Their results 
showed that the critical wave length decreases with an in crease in pres sure and there fore 
bubbles are easier to disintegrate  by the disturbances at high er pressure.  However, the 
critical wav elength is n ot necessarily equi valent to the m aximum  stable bubble size and 
their approach alone cannot quantif y the pressure effect on bubble size.   58

bAll the m odels m entioned above neglected th e effect of the internal circulation of 
the gas in a bubble.  Due to th e continuity of the tangential velocity in th e gas and liquid 
phases, the interna l circulation ve locity is  of the sam e order of magnitude as the bubble 
rise velocity.  A centr ifugal force is induced by this ci rculation, pointing outwards to the 
bubble surface, which can suppress the distu rbances at the g as-liqu id interface and act as 
a stabilizing  force.  This force m ay be anothe r reason that ex plains the underestim ation of 
 by the m odel of Grace et al.  (1978), besides the argum ents discussed by Batchelor 
(1987).  On the other hand, such a centrifugal force can also disintegrate the bubble as it 
increases with an increase in bubble size.  The bubble breaks up when the centrifugal 
force exceeds the surface ten sion f orce, especi ally at high pressures w hen gas density is 
high. 
Levich (1962) recognized the im portance of internal gas circ ulation, assum ed the 
centrifugal force to be equal to the dynam ic pressure induc ed by the gas m oving at the 
bubble rise velocity, u, and proposed a sim ple expressi on to calculate the m aximum 
stable bubble size: 
max2233.63
bl gd

ρρ≈   (3.4) 
where gρ is gas phase density. Equation (3.4) sh ows a significant effect of pressure on 
the m aximum stable bubble size which is quali tatively in the right direction; however, it 
severely under-predicts the m aximum stable bu bble size in churn-tur bulent flow regim e.  
Moreover, the surround ing turbulence effect  on the bubbles is not tak en into accoun t. 
Luo et al. (1999) proposed a m odel which accou nts for the internal circu lation of 
the gas in a bubble by using the force balance between the centrifugal force and the 
surface tension force. They consider a single large bubble rising in a stag nant liqu id at a  
velocity of ub, without any disturbance on the ga s-liquid interface. The internal 
circulation model provides an estim ation of the upper lim it on the m aximum stable 
bubble size, since the external stresses in th e liquid phase are neglected.  In actual bubble   59 
 
 colum ns or slurry bubble colum ns, especially  in churn-turbulent flow where the liquid 
phase turbulence intensity is high, the obs erved m aximum stable  bubble size should be 
smaller than the predictions.  Based on th eir model, the m aximum stable bubble size 
rising in liquids can be expressed as:

was calculated by Bhavaraju et al.’s  (1978) model. Luo et al.  (1999) provide an 
estim ation of the upper lim it on the m aximum stable bubble size, since the external 
stresses in the liquid phase are neglecte d. Thus it s ignificantly o verestim ates the

3.2.2 Number of Daughter Bubbles 
The param eter  in Equation (3.2) denotes th e average num ber of daughter 
particles produced by break-up of  a parent particle of volum e v. The assum ption of 
binary breakage has been widely  used by m any authors (e.g., Hesketh  et al. , 1991;  
Nambiar et al. , 1992; Luo and Svendsen, 1996, Martínez-Bazán  et al., 1999b, Lehr and 
Mewes, 2001). The experim ental results of Hesketh et al. (1991) support this assum ption, 
while Princ e et al.  (1989) noted that bubble break-up is often accompanied by the 
production of two prim ary bubbles and a number of sm all fragm ents. Incorporation of ()'mv

 this observation, rather than binary breakup, is expected to significantly change the 
number of sm aller bubbles and the interf acial area concentration predicted by the 
transport equation. However, such a model has no t been proposed yet.  Binary breakup is 
assum ed in this work. 
 
3.2.3 Breakup Rate and Da ughter Bubble Siz e Probability  Density Function (p.d.f.)  
For gas-liquid dispersed turbulent flow, the kinetic energy carried by the turbulent  
eddies p lays a dom inant role in th e break-up  process. The imbalanc e between the k inetic 
energy and the surface energy is us ed to define the break -up rate.  
Lee et al.  (1987a) developed a bubble breakup m odel based on the work of 
Narsim han et al.  (1979) using dim ensional analysis to obtain an ex pression for the 
average freq uency of ed dies, Λ, arriving at a drop  (bubble) su rface, which  results in th e 
following breakup rate ()BdiΩ :

Blanch (1990)’s m odel are incom plete as th ey do not provide the daughter bubble size 
p.d.f. 
The daughter particle size probability de nsity function (p.d.f.) was first introduced 
by Valentas et al.  (1966) to describe the size distribu tion of daughter drops or bubbles. So 
far, four approaches have been used for da ughter particle size p.d.f . modeling: statistical 
models (Valentas  et al. , 1966; Coulaloglou and Tavlarides, 1977; Lee  et al. , 1987b; 
Chatzi  et al. , 1989; Chatzi and Kiparissides, 1992; Novikov and Dommer muth, 1997), 
phenom enological m odel based  on s urface energ y consideration (Tsou ris and Tavlarides , 
1994; Luo and Svendsen, 1996), phenom enological  model based on turbulence stress and 
surface tens ion consideration (M artínez-Bazán  et al. , 1999b), and hybrid models based on 
a com bination of the first and second approaches (Konno  et al. , 1983; C ohen, 1991). 
Almost all the statistical a nd hybrid models have the sam e deficiency in that the 
daughter particle size p.d.f. is basically i ndependent of the turbulent energy of the 
underlying turbulence. Konno et al. ’s (1983) m odel even does not depend on the parent 
bubble size. These two results ar e contrary to expe rimental observation. The shape of the 
daughter particle size p. d.f. is a sour ce of dis pute also becau se the daughter particle size 
p.d.f. obtained by the phenom enological m odel,  based on surface energy consideratio n, is 
sharply different from  the other three m entioned above. Therefore, m ore experim ental 
and theoretical investigations are need ed to understand the physics involved. 
Based on the theory of isotropic turbulen ce, Luo and Svendsen (1996) proposed a 
breakup criteria in which the breakup probability is proportional to the difference 
between the energy  carried by  the arriv ing ed dies and  the increas e in surface energ y due   63 
 
 to a breakup (Figure 3.2). The bom barding frequency of the eddies of size λ on bubbles

only eddies which have a length scale com parable to the bubble diam eter can cause   64

given size at a given combination of the da ughter bubble sizes and, thus, does not need a 
predefined daughter bubble si ze distribution. T he daughter bubble size distribution is a 
result tha t can be calcu lated dire ctly f rom the m odel. 
According to Luo and Svendsen’s (1996) model, m ore energy is required for 
binary equ al-sized  break -up than for unequal- sized break -up (Figure 3.2 ) becaus e more 
interfacial area is generated (Nam biar et al., 1992). Therefore, the possibility of splittin g 
a fraction of bubbles of size d from parent bubble of size d should be inversely 
proportional to '
()233 23 2' ' d d +− − dd , so that the daughter bubble size p.d.f. should be 
U-shaped. T his assum ption is in line with  the experim ental obs ervation for bubble and 
drop break-up in turbulent pipe flow wher e unequal size breakup was found more likely 
(Hesketh  et al. , 1991). However, Luo and Svendsen’s ( 1996) m odel also predicts that all 
the bubbles of size greater than the turbulence inertial subr ange tend to breakup, and the 
possibility of tearing a tiny part off the parent bubble is the highest, which is not  
supported by observation of Hesketh et al.  (1991).

DBased on Martínez-Bazán et al. ’s (1999a; 1999b) m odel, the possibility of

πσ= . This equation is valid for bubbles larger than 
the m aximum stable bubble which is provided by  Equation  (3.6).  Sim ilar to the m odel of 
Luo and Svendsen (1996), this m odel predicts  the breakup rate for original bubbles of a  
given size at a given combination of the da ughter bubble sizes (Figure 3.5) and thus does 
not need a predefined daughter bubble si ze distribution. The daughter bubble size 
distribution is a result that can be calculated directly from  the m odel.   68 
 
 
 
Figure 3.5 Dimensionless da ughter size distribution (fro m Lehr and Mewes, 2001). 
 
Hagesaether  et al.  (2002a) expanded and refined the breakup m odel of Luo and 
Svendsen (1996). The assum ption, which is suggested by Lee et al.  (1987a) and Luo and 
Svendsen (1 996), that e ddies of a larger s cale will jus t give the bubble a tran slational 
velocity whereas eddies of si milar scal e may break up bubbles, is rem oved. Ins tead, 
eddies of all scales are cons idered to be able  to breakup a bubble. In addition to the 
aforem entioned surface ener gy criteria suggested by Luo and Svendsen (1996), 
Hagesaether  et al.  (2002a) argued that the energy density of the daughter bubbles, which 
is the surface energy divide d by the volum e of the daughter  bubbles, must be lower or 
equal to the energy density of the arriving eddies which cause the breakup (Figure 3.6).  
The bom barding frequency of the eddies of size λ on bubbles of size dis the sam e as

eddies of s ize i iv

According to the energy dens ity criteria, arriving eddy with higher energy density 
is needed to breakup a sm all bubble, or tear a tiny part off the pare nt bubble. Thus, these 
scenario are less likely (e.g., Figure 3.6c) co mpared with Luo and Sve ndsen’s (1996) 
model prediction. The inhe rent weaknesses in Luo a nd Svendsen’s (1996) mode l 
regarding the breakup rate for s mall bubbles  and s mall daughter bubbles fragm ents are 
thus r emoved. H owever, the  num erica l implem entation o f this m odel is  sign ificantly 
more expensive than other breakup m odels as double integral is needed for all the 
possible edd ies classes (sizes ) and all energy levels for certain  size of eddy. Therefore, 
Hagesaether  et al. ’s (2002a) breakup model is not  implemented in this work.   70

3.3 Bubble Co alescence 
The coalescence of two bubbles in turbulent flow is usually considered to occur in 
three steps.  First, the bu bbles co llide, then  the surface of the coll iding  bubbles fla ttens  
against each  other trapping a s mall amount of liquid between  them . Since the collisio n of 
three or m ore bubbles at the sam e time has a very sm all probability, only binary collision 
is norm ally considered in coales cence m odels.   71

Coalescence m ay not result from  each collis ion, and thu s coalescence efficiency 
was introduced by m any investigators. The most popular m odel for the coalescence  
efficiency is the film -thinning m odel (e.g., Kirkpatrick and Lockett, 1974, Prince and 
Blanch, 1990, Luo, 1993). In this type of m odel, when the bubbles approach faster, they 
tend to bounce back without co alescence due to the lim itation on the f ilm drainage rate 
governed by  the surface  tension (Figure 3. 7).Two bubbles will coa lesce provid ed they

3.3.1 Collision Fr equency 
Collis ion m ay occur du e to a variety of mechanism s. One is the random  motion of 
bubbles due to turbulence (Figure 3.7). Saffm an and Turner (1956) proposed a collision 
frequency model which only takes turbulen t collision into acc ount: 
() ()() (122 23 13 3 11    4ij i j ij i i j dd nn d dd msπθε−−− ⎡⎤=+ +⎢⎥⎣⎦) (3.21) 
where ijθ is the collision frequency betw een bubbles with diam eter of  and idjd,  and in
jn is bubble num ber density (3m−), ε is loc al turbu lent dissipa tion rate (2 3ms−). This  
expression for the collision frequency of bubbles or drops has been verified by Kuboi  et 
al. (1972) using the experim ental results for the collisions of equal-sized drops in 
benzene-water and cyclohexanone-w ater system s and has been used by many authors (e.g. 
Lee et al. , 1987a; Luo, 1993; Tsouris and Tavlarides, 1994). 
In addition to turbulence, bubbles of differe nt sizes have different rise velocities 
that m ay lead to collision (F igure 3.8a). Also bubbles loca ted in a region of relatively 
high liquid velocity m ay collide with bubbles in  a slower section of  the velocity field 
(Figure 3.8b ). It is assu med that collision s from these va rious mechanism s are cum ulative . 
In support of this, Swift and Friedlander ( 1964) reported the cum ulative collision of 
aerosol particles from  Brow nian motion and lam inar shear . Prince and Blanch (1990) 
proposed a collision frequency m odel based on  the summ ation of the turbulent collision 
rate, buoy ancy-driv en collision rate a nd lam inar shear co llisio n rate as follows:   73

Most au thors use tu rbulence-induced coll ision only, partly  because th e wake-
induced collision, especial ly the wake-induced coalescen ce efficiency, is not well   76 
 
 I Cunderstood. As far as the order of m agnitude  is concerned, the wake and turbulence 
induced collision are of the sam e order, whil e the lam inar shear induced collision is les s 
important. The buoyancy-driv en collision is a n inlin e collision, and when the le ading  
bubble collides with the traili ng bubble, the trailing bubble is in the wake of the leading 
bubble. Hence, the velocity di fference between the two bubbles cannot be calculated by 
the free rising velocity diffe rence as suggested by Clift et al.  (1978). In summ ary, in 
turbulent flo w there are only two im portan t collision m echanism s: the wake entrainm ent 
and tu rbulence. The d ifficulty is  that the knowledge of the wake-ind uced coales cence 
efficiency is essentially non-existent at pres ent. One can either assum e that the wake-
induced co alescence efficiency is  the sam e as the turbulence-ind uced coales cence 
efficiency s o that the s ummation of these tw o collision frequency can  then be used to 
calculate the coalescence efficiency (Hibiki and Ishii, 2000), or one can consider only the 
turbulence-induced collision as the existing coalescen ce efficien cy m odels are based on 
turbulence induced coalescence (L uo, 1993).  W e will us e the latt er approach in th is work 
because the coales cence rate is m ainly de termined by the coalescen ce efficiency. 
 
3.3.2 Coalescence Efficiency  
Up to now, the coalescence efficiency m odels were m ainly based  on the 
phenom enological an alysis. According to coales cence theo ry (Ross  et al. , 1978; Chesters, 
1991), coalescence will m ore likely to o ccur upon a collision of two bubbles if the  
contact tim e (in teraction tim e), t, exceeds th e coalescen ce tim e, t, requi red for 
drainag e of the liqu id film betw een them  to a critica l ruptu re thickness. C oulaloglou  and 
Tavlarides (1977) suggested the following e xpression in liquid droplet coalescence rate

Experim ents (Doubliez, 1991; Duineveld,  1994) with individual bubbles show 
that sm all bubbles and sm all approach velociti es lead to higher coalescence efficiency.  
Thus, for two collid ing bubbles with given dia meters the coalesc ence e fficiency depends    78 
 
 on the relative velocity of appr oach.  This velocity depends on the angle at which the two 
bubbles collide.  Lehr and Mewes (2001) assum e that the relative proba bility is equal for 
all steradian s.  Thus, the coales cence efficiency can be written as:

The com puted coalescence efficiency from  models derive d from  gas-liquid 
dispersion experim ents (Prince and Blanch , 1990; Chesters, 1991; Luo, 1993; Lehr and 
Mewes, 2001) are of the sam e order of m agnitude (e.g., for di = dj = 5 mm,  ε = 1 m2/s3, 
PC = 0.1~0.2).  
It should be noted that the although the buoyancy driven and lam inar shear 
collision  frequencies  may be superim posed on turbul ence induce collision frequency 
(Prince and Blanch, 1990) because the bubble rela tive velocity can be superim posed, the  
turbulent  induced  coalescence efficiency  model  may not be applied to buoyancy driven 
and lam inar shear collis ion even ts. If the Equa tion (3.32) can still be us ed, coalescence

collision are superim posed on tur bulence ind uced collision rate (  increas es), the 
coalescence rate could decrease . Most authors only account fo r the tu rbulence-ind uced 
coales cence and adjust the param eters in their m odels.  W e also use the turbu lence-iju

different velocity will be neglected. 
 
3.4 Attempts of implementation of the bubble population balance into 
CFD for investigati on of bubble column flows 
The population balance equation is widely  used in the chem ical engineering 
community in crysta llization, c oagulati on, e mulsion, precip itation, liquid- liquid  
extraction, aerosol form ation,  grinding, and granulation.   Most of these modeling 
investigations are focused on the kernel de velopm ent and computational m ethod, wit hout 
taking into account com plicated , or sim plified, convection. 
In gas-liquid flow, convection is im portant and cannot be neglected.  The  
implem entation of  interfacial area density tran sport equa tion in the  investigation  of heat 
transfer in one dimensional  pipe flow is an active field in nuclear engineering (e.g.,  
Hibiki  et al., 2003; Ishii  et a l., 2003). W hile this is a good st art in the inve stigation of 
multiphase flows in the heat exchan ge tubes,  the one di mensional assum ption is not valid 
in bubble colum n flows.  
Several attempts of i mplem entation of the bubble population balance in the 
bubble column flow simulations were m ade.  The authors m ainly focused on eithe r 
investigation of the breakup and coalescen ce model, using sim plified one-dim ensional 
flow field and estim ated turbulence property (e.g., Colella  et al., 1999; Hagesaether  et al. , 
2000; 2002b), or on the num erical m ethod for solving the population balance equation. 
(e.g. Cam pos and Lage, 2003). These invest igations are in line with the m ethods 
mentioned above (i.e., one dim ensional). 
Lo (1998) u sed a sing le gas phase v elocity field  for all th e bubble grou ps (m ulti 
group, two-fluid m odel).  Olm as et al.  (2001) im plem ented the population balance 
equation in an Euler-Euler code (CFX 4.3), using the single-phase kε− model f or the   80 
 
 turbulence in the liquid phase, the breakup model by Luo and Svendsen (1996) and the 
coalescence model by Prince and Blanch (1990). The authors st udied the flow field in a 
2D-axisymm etic bubble colum n (10 c m diameter), operated at different superficial gas 
velocitie s (0.5-9.6 cm /s) and  compared the com puted ax ial liqu id velocity, loca l gas  
holdup and bubble size dist ribution with the experim ental da ta obtained by using the laser 
Doppler velocim etry, optical probe, and photography respectively (although the use of 
LDV and photography in high superficial ga s velocity is questionable).  Olm as et al.  
(2001) used 10 bubbles classes an d assum ed that all bubbles m ove with the sam e speed.  
By m odifying the drag for mulation to in clude the turbu lence disper sion, w hich is a 
function of turbulent kinetic energy, and the liquid holdup gradient, they obtained the  
following modified drag for mula:

where . The extra term  in Equatio n (3.35) is essentially a  late ral d ispersion  
force. Ol mos et al.  (2001) focused on the bubbly flow and transition flow regim e, while 
this study focused on churn-turbulent flow re gime, which is of industrial interest. The 
overall gas holdup is not predicted well beyond U g > 8  cm/s (O lmas et a l., 2001).  
Moreover, it is difficult to draw conclusi ons on whether BP BE is needed from  Olmos et 
al.’s (2001) work for a num ber of re asons. Th e use of LDV i n cylindrical bubble column 
at gas holdup higher than 10% is questionabl e, as it is out of the upper lim it of LDV 
measure ment.  Thus the liquid velocity profile co mparison is question able for all ex cept 
at superficial gas velocity equal to 1. 7 cm /s.  For sim ilar reason, the photography 
determ ined bubble s ize distribution is a lso que stionable.  In addition,  the improvem ent on 
the gas holdup prediction with  BPBE is m arginal as th e flow is in the bubbly and 
trans ient flo w regim e, where break up and coal escence is relatively weak. The predicted  
gas holdup profiles were in better agreem ent with data (e.g., the m aximum  gas holdup 
appears  in the cen ter) due to the m odified  drag force form ula com pared to 2D  axi-
symmetric s imulations p erformed by other authors.  However, compared to other auth ors’ 
(e.g., Krish na et al. , 1999) 2D axi-symm etric sim ulations, the predicted liquid axial 0.1TDC=  81 
 
 velocity profiles were worse.  Besides, the gas holdup is over-predict ed and flatter than 
experim ental data, which indicates furt her tuning of the recommended value  0.1TDC=  
may be necessary. 
Lehr and  Mewes (2001) assum ed equilib rium between th e coalesc ence an d break -
up processes, which reduces th e population balance m odel to a single transport equation.  
In bubble c olumns, however, the assum ption of equilibrium  may not be applic able 
because of significan t influence of convection.   This transpo rt equation was im plemented 
into three  dimensional Euler-Eu ler framework to sim ulate a u niformly aerated cy lindrical 
bubble column 0.29 m  in diam eter a nd 4.425 m in height operated at 2.0 g ms =Uc  
superficial gas velocity.  Several breakup a nd coalescence m odels (Levich, 1962; Prince 
and Blanch, 1990; Luo and Svendsen, 1996) a nd experim ental observations (Doubliez, 
1991; Duineveld, 1994) were used to derive a simplified rate kernel for this transport 
equation (source term ). These reported rate kernels are independent of the bubble volum e, 
which is co ntrary  to ex perimental observations.  In addi tion to the  spiral motion and  
recirculating  structu res, Lehr and Mewes (2 001) also in dicate that the scale of the 
computed eddies seem s to be com parable to the colum n diam eter.  The tim e averaged gas  
holdup and velocity profile well predic ted the experim ental data of Yao et al. (1991).  
However, Lehr and M ewes (2001) found the bubble size distribution to be bimodal, 
which has never been reported for the bubbly flow regim e ( 2.0 gU cms = ).  It is 
possible that this result is an artifact of  the oversim plified br eakup/coalescence rate 
kernel and it sugges ts that m ulti-group bubble  population  balance eq uation m ay be 
necessary. 
Buwa and Ranade (2002) investigated , experim entally and num erically, a 
rectangular bubble column, with 0. 2 m widt h × 1.2 m he ight × 0.05 m depth.  The 
superf icial air v elocity was low  and varied from  0.16 to 0.83 cm /s.  In addition to 
reconfirm  the m ain findings of Pfleger  et al.  (1999) and Becker  et al.  (1999), Buwa and 
Ranade (2002) also incor porated a single transport e quation suggested by Lehr and 
Mewes (200 1) to inves tigate the effect of spar ger design.  Their findi ngs indicate, at least   82 
 
 in the bubbly flow regime, the importance of  bubble size since the influence of sparger 
may be represented solely by the selection of appropriate bubble size.  However, different 
ways of representing the gas sparger in th e computational model was not found to have 
any significant influence on pred icted plume oscillation time.  These results indicate that 
the bubble size and bubble size distribution play an important role in determining the 
dynamics of gas-liquid flows in bubble columns,  which is in line with the suggestion of 
Krishna et al . (2000). Buwa and Ranade (2002) further implemented the breakup and 
coalescence kernels suggested by Lehr and Mewes (2001) and tracked 5 different group 
of bubbles (0.5 – 5 mm).  The prelimin ary computed bubble distribution agrees 
reasonably well with their experimental data. 
The previous implementations mostly focused on the bubbly flow, where bubble 
breakup and coalescence are not important. In  this work, we will systematically 
investigate the influence of the BPBE on the CFD simulation of bubbly and churn-
turbulent flow and quantitative comparison will be performed with experimental data 
whenever possible.

4.1 CFD Model Equations 
In the present work, the flow in bubble colum ns was m odeled using the Eulerian 
multiphase m odel, as w ell as th e Algebraic Slip Mixture M odel (A SMM). These models 
have been reviewed in Chapter 2. The m odel equations and closures used are listed in 
Table 4.1 and Table 4.2, respectively. 
The widely used drag form ulation does not take the elevated pressure into account. 
Krishna and van Baten (2001a) proposed in th e drag form ulation as density correction 
factor, the ratio of gas density at  operating and atm ospheric pressure,,1 g gatmρρ . 
However, the introduction of such correctio n factor significantl y over-predicted the 
overall gas holdup at higher superficial velocity and higher pressure (e.g., 
30 , 0.6 gUc msP MPa = = ). For that reason, the d ensity correction facto r is reduced in 
this study to ( . In the Euler-Euler m odel, tu rbulence in the liquid phase is 
modeled through a set of m odified k-ε equations  with extra term s that include in terphase 
turbulent mom entum transf er (Launder and Spalding, 1974; Elghobashi and Abou-Arab, 
1983). For the dispersed gas phase, turbulence closure is effected through correlations 
from  the theory of dispersion of discrete particles by homogeneous turbulence (Tchen, )0.25
,1 gg atmρρ  84 
 
 1947). In ASMM, the turbulent stress term  in the m ixture equation is closed by solving a  
k-ε model for the m ixture phase.

 The local bubble diameter is an importa nt needed input parameter for the 
simulation.  In the past it was either estim ated from former experience or by a trial-and 
error method, or it was calculated from availa ble mean bubble diamet er correlations. This 
is mostly done because modeling different si zes of bubbles as individual phases leads to 
high computational cost and ha s numerical convergence problems .  Such approach is still 
plausible in bubbly flow because bubble-bubble  interactions are weak and the bubble 
sizes are narrowly distributed.  However, in  churn-turbulent flow, where most industrial 
applications lie, bubble-bubble interactions resu lt in widely distri buted bubble sizes that 
may be substantially different from the “m ean” bubble size assumption.   In addition, in 
order to generate a simulation result that re sembles available data, the “mean” bubble size 
is customarily adjusted by a trial-and-error pr ocedure and the value so  chosen often is far 
from reality. 
There is a need, when evaluating the performance of existing bubble column 
reactors and when designing ne w ones in churn-turbulent flow , to assess the gas holdup 
radial distribution, because it drives liqui d recirculation, and local interfacial area 
concentration distribution, because it is esse ntial to mass transfer.  Engineering level of 
accuracy is needed.  Based on extensive studi es by many authors, we know that the two-
fluid model based codes (e.g. FLUENT, CFX, CFDLIB, etc.) that ut ilize the mean bubble 
size concept cannot predict well the observed gas holdup radial profiles even in 3D 
simulation, in spite of  claims of partial success to the contrary (Krishna  et al. , 2000; Pan 
and Dudukovic, 2001), while the predicted ve locity profiles and overall gas holdup 
estimates are pretty good.  Mo reover, available estimates of the local interfacial area are 
based on the predicted local gas holdup and assumed mean bubble size and are likely in 
error.  One of the reasons for the mismatch  of the holdup profile prediction and data 
could be that the current simulations us e the so-called “mean” bubble size assumption, 
which does not hold well in the ch urn-turbulent flow regime.  To remedy this situation, 
the implementation of the bubble population ba lance model (BPBE) in the Euler-Euler 
model or ASMM is needed.  This eliminates the need to assume a single constant bubble 
size and possibly may improve the gas holdup profile prediction.  Most importantly, the   88 
 
 nimplementation of BPBE allows one to pr edict the bubble size dist ribution locally, and 
eliminates the trial-and-e rror procedure rega rding the unknown m ean bubble diam eter 
mentioned above, while provid ing the c apability  of pre dicting the  inte rfacia l area  
concentratio n locally th roughout the colum n. In this work we  will ob tain it via the  bubble 
population balance equation which is  reviewed in Chapter 3.  
 
4.2 Bubble Po pulation Balance Eq uation 
Bubble Population Balance Equation (B PBE)  and breakup and coalescence 
closures have been reviewed in Chapter 3.  There is no analytical solution for BPBE 
expressed by Equation (4.1) except for a fe w cases, thus the gas phase needs to be 
discre tized into  subclasses acco rding  to bubble size, and be solved separately.

theore tically solve  the continui ty and m omentum  equation for  gas phases (  equals 
to the num ber of distinct bubble sizes to be tr acked) and the liquid phase.  However, it is 
very difficult, if not im possible, to get a large num ber of hi ghly non-linear m omentum  
equations to converge in a re alistic period of tim e (e.g., () 2 1N+ equations in 2D and 
 in 3D).  To circum vent the problem  of solving m omentum equations for N () 3 1N+ 1+ 
separate phases, only the continuity and momentum  equation for two phases (gas and 
liquid) are solved as shown below.  The gas phase is discre tized into n subclasses

balance equation for the  bubble class can be written as thi  89

Figure 4.1 Bubble reassignm ent to pivots 
 
The basic idea, in discretizating the bubbl e population balance equation, is that 
bubbles in a size range, say Ri, are assigned to a pivotal size xi.  However, breakup and 
coalescence processes may produce bubbles that are between  such pivotal sizes (except in 
the c ase of  a unif orm linear g rid, i.e. , xi = ivmin) and m ust be reassigned to the pivots (see 
Figure 4.1). The reassign ment must be done car efully to p reserve th e accu rate calculation  
of the selected m oments of the p.d.f.   Kum ar and Ra mkrishna (1996a) proposed the 
following way to preserve any selected m oments.  For xi ≤ v < xi+1, let the f raction of 
bubbles of size v assigned to xi be denoted by ()i
iγ, and a fraction of ()

size xi+1.  The reass ignment will pres erve th e rth mom ent provided:

4.2.3 Solution Procedure 
The segregate solver (i.e., governing equati ons are solved sequen tially rather than 
simultaneously/coup led togethe r) is used to solve the flow field equations. Because the  
governing equations are non-linear and coupled, several iterati ons  of the solution loop 
must be perfor med before a converged soluti on is obtained for a given tim e step. Each 
iteration con sists of  steps  illus trated in Figure 4.2 and are ou tlined below . 
1. Fluid properties are updated , based on the current solu tion. If  the ca lculatio n 
has just beg un, the fluid properties  will be updated based  on the initializ ed 
solution, or the solution a t the p reviou s time step.   95 
 
 2. The m omentum  and continuity equati ons are solved, using Phase Coupled 
SIMPLE (PC-SIMPLE) algorithm  (Vasqu ez and Ivanov, 2000) in the Euler-
Euler m odel, and SIMPLEC algorith m (Van Doorm al and Raithby, 1984) in 
ASMM, for the pres sure-velocity coupling. 
3. Equations for scalars such as turb ulence  quan tities  (e.g., kinetic energy and 
dissipation rate), species concentrati on, and bubble population distribution are 
solved using the previously updated va lues of the other variables. The 
inform ation such as local bubble size di stribution and turbulent viscosity are 
used in the next iteration. 
4. A check for convergence of the equation set is m ade.

 1l4.3 Boundary and Initial Conditions 
Initially the  colum n is filled with liqui d (or slurry which is conside red pseudo 
homogeneous), i.e., α= 0,g; α= up to the leve l that m atches the s tatic liquid he ight in 
the experiment. Above this leve l, the initial condition is 0lα=; 1gα=
1, ,gg g uU. To prevent liqu id 
escape from  the colum n (since no  net liquid  flow is used), the com putational dom ain in 
the axial direction is about 100% and 50% to 80 %  higher than the st atic liquid height for  
two-dim ensional and three-dim ensional sim ulation, respectively. The gas is introduced at 
the bottom  of the colum n where only the gas pha se is allowed to pass through. Since it is 
impossible (and it is not necessa ry) to resolv e the gas injec tors used in  the experim ents 
(e.g., 0.33-1.32 mm  diameter holes on the perf orated plate) with th e currently em ployed 
mesh, the gas feed is introduced unifor mly ove r the bottom  plane in the  simulation, i.e., 
 0lu α== = at 0z=. No-slip condition is used at the colum n wall. Finally the 
pressure condition, i.e. the operation pressure p, is im posed on the top of the colum n. 
The bubble  diam eter a t the sparg er (i.e., bo undary con dition for BPBE) is 
assum ed to be uniform  and is calculated from  Miyahara’s et al. (1983) correlation, which 
can be written as:

5.1 Experimental Tech niques Used 
At the Chem ical Reaction Engineering La boratory, W ashington University in St. 
Louis, the u nique CARPT-CT facilities allo w non-invas ive monitorin g of the velocity 
and holdup profiles of two phases in opaque multiph ase re actors on a single pla tform 
(Devanathan  et al. , 1990; Yang  et al. , 1992; Kum ar et al. , 1997b; Degaleesan, 1997; 
Chen  et al. , 1999). 
In a set of cylindrical air-water bub ble colum ns, Degaleesan (1997), Chen et al.  
(1999), and Ong (2003) experim entally studied the tim e-averaged  velocity and turbulence 
param eters of the liquid phase by using the Computer Autom ated Radioactive Particle 
Tracking  (CARPT) Technique. CARPT is a n on-invasive technique  for tracking the 
trajectory of a radioactive particle (Figure 5.1a). In CARPT, one resorts to tagging the 
"typical fluid elem ent" with a gam ma ray s ource (i.e., the liquid phase is tagged with a 
neutrally bu oyant rad ioactive p article). Th e particle location  at each tim e instant, x(t), 
can be reconstructed from  a record of the gamma-ray photon counts at a num ber of 
strategically  located detector s, and a pre-established calib ration between the detector 
counts and tracer particle lo cation. Tracer particle traject ory (Figure 5. 1b) is acqu ired 
over a very long tim e, typically 18-20 hours, in order to collect sufficient statistics 
(typically, tw o million or m ore occurren ces in  the colum n). By tim e differencin g of   101 
 
 tpu()success ive particle po sitions one obtains th e instantaneous L agrangian p article v elocity, 
, and cross-correlation of these can be us ed to com pute the com ponents of the 
turbulent eddy diffusivity tensor (Devanathan  et al. , 1990; Yang  et al. , 1992; Degaleesan,  
1997).

The tim e-averaged liqu id velocities  and tu rbulence parameters  in the Eulerian  
framework, i.e. at different positions in the colu mn, can be calcu lated from  CARPT data 
provided the re is suf ficient data to g uarantee co nvergent s tatistics ( typically, tw o million 
or m ore occurren ces in  the co lumn). The column is divided into co mpartments. The 
velocity of  the particle is then assig ned to  that com partment which contains the m id-point 
of the tw o successiv e position s of the particle. In  this m anner instantaneo us velocities  are 
assigned to their respective com partments. En semble averaging is done of the velocities   102 
 
 in a given compartment over the number of times (repetitions) that the particle visits that 
compartment. The turbulence-related correla tions can be calculated after the mean 
velocities are obtained. 
In a set of cylindrical air-water and air-Therminol -glass-beads (slurry) bubble 
columns, Kumar (1994), Chen et al.  (1999), Ong (2003), and Shaikh  et al.  (2003) 
experimentally studied the time-averaged  gas holdup distributio n by using Computed 
Tomography (CT). By placing a strong gamma-ray source in th e plane of interest and a 
planar array of collimated scintillation detect ors on the other side of the reactor, one 
measures attenuation in the beam of gamma ra diation (Figure 5.2). The attenuation is a 
function of the line-averaged holdup distribut ion along the path of the beam. Many such 
"projections" are obtained at different angu lar orientations around the reactor. The 
complete set of projections is then used to back-calculate the cro ss-sectional distribution 
of densities. Since the density at any point in the cross-section is a sum of densities of 
individual phases weighted by their volume fractions, the cross-se ctional volume fraction 
(holdup) distribution of a part icular phase can be uniquely  recovered provided only two 
phases are present. The total scanning time is about 2 hours, thus the scanned image 
provides a time-averaged cross-sectional distri bution of mixture density. The results of 
the two-dimensional holdup distribution can be  subsequently averaged azimuthally for 
direct comparison against a suitable simulation.  
Details of the experimental setup and pr ocedure for the particle tracking and the 
tomographic techniques may be found elsewhere (Devanathan  et al. , 1990; Devanathan, 
1991; Moslemian  et al. , 1992; Yang  et al. , 1992; Kumar  et al. , 1995; Kumar  et al. , 1997b; 
Chaouki  et al. , 1997; Degaleesan, 1997; Roy, 2000). All the data used in this thesis for 
comparison with simulation came from those previous experimental studies (Kumar, 
1994; Degaleesan, 1997; Chen  et al., 1999; Ong, 2003; Shaikh  et al., 2003).

5.2 Two-dimensional Axisymmetric Simulation 
It is worth noting that the real observ ed bubble colum n flows are highly transient 
and turbulent with ri sing three-dim ensional vortical bubb le swarm s whic h cause sm aller 
bubbles and liquid to be trailed in their wakes. T he flow ne ver reaches steady-state. The  
axisymm etric boundary condition in 2D com putations, however , causes the liquid flow to 
develop very quickly  (5-10 s of real tim e) and reach its long -time “stead y” pattern.  Thus, 
the realizations of the instantaneous hydr odynam ic properties cannot be captured as the 
instan taneou s flow is never axisy mmetric in  reality, i. e., signif icant instantan eous 
azim uthal and radial components do exist. Be sides, the tim e-scale of the dynam ic flows   104 
 
 cannot be captured as well.  However, the experiments had shown re peatedly (Hills, 1974; 
Svendsen  et al., 1992; Degaleesan, 1997) that, in the time-averaged sense, there is a 
steady axisymmetric flow pattern  in a cylindrical bubble column . Therefore, it is possible 
that 2D axisymmetric simulation captures the essence of certain time-averaged 
hydrodynamic properties in bubble co lumn flows.  Since these 2D computations are so 
much faster to perform, we want to examine to what extent they capture the experimental 
evidence.  Moreover, it is also important to  learn the effect of different breakup and 
coalescence closures before one performs  full 3D computations .  The breakup and 
coalescence models implemented in the simulation are listed in Table 5.1.

In the churn-turbulent flow regime, there are no significant gas holdup axial 
gradients in the fully developed region (Bukur  et al. , 1996), which indicates that breakup 
and coalescence phenomena are close to equilibrium. This invariance with axial position 
of radial gas holdup profiles was also captured by Shollenberger  et al.  (2000), George  et 
al. (2000) and Ong (2003).  In contrast, the mo del predicted coalescence rate is about one 
order of magnitude higher than the predic ted breakup rate calculated from the reported 
breakup closures.   
There are a number of possi ble reasons for the mismatch  in magnitude of model 
predicted breakup and coalescence rates.  
1) The bubble breakup rate and daughter bubble p.d.f. m easurements are done in 
dilute system, which may not be applicable  in churn-turbulent flow regime where 
the gas holdup is high.   105 
 
 2) In this study, the energy dissipation rate obtained by the kε− model can only 
account for sm all scale energy dissipati on. In other words, the predicted 
dissipation rate could be underp redicted. If dissipation rate, ε, increases, the 
model predicted breakup rate increases linear ly with 13ε, the collision  rate also  
increases linearly  wi th 13ε , but the coales cence efficiency decreases 
exponentially  with res pect to 13ε. Thus, if the energy dissipation rate is 
underpredicted, then the coalescence rate is  overpredicted and the breakup rate is 
underpredicted. In addition, as illustra ted in S ection 3.3.2, if bubble relative 
velocities difference induced collision, negl ected at presen t, is superim posed on 
the tu rbulen ce induced c ollision, th e bubble coa lescence rate c ould decreas e. 
3) Moreover,  the es timated breakup  tim e scale (m easured from  the onset of  
deformation ), bτ, and coalescence tim e scale (m easured from the in stant when 
two bubbles collide with each other),  cτ, are higher by an orde r of magnitude than 
the tim e ste p used in sim ulation (~  5 m s). Theref ore, it is assum ed im plicitly in 
the s imulation that th e dissipa tion rate ε at time t to btτ+ (or ctτ+) is the mean 
dissipation rate to which breaking (or co alescing) bubbles are exposed to in the 
turbulent flow field. Turbulence ind uced coales cence occurs due to eddies with  
sizes large r than or equ al to the s izes of the collid ing bubb les. The coa lescen ce 
time scale however is determ ined by the liquid physical properties, bubble 
diam eter an d the ch aracteristic s ize of the ed dies that in duced the  collision. 
Therefore, the history of the dissipati on rate surrounding the bubbles after this 
collision is not im porta nt for the coalesc ence ra te estimation. However, this  is not 
the case for bubble breakup rate estim ation. The breakup is i nduced by the eddy 
bombardm ent. The bubble breakup rate is determ ined by al l the incom ing eddies 
reach ing the bubble surface during the bubble defor mation. Thus the history of 
dissipation rate surrounding the bubbles fr om the onset of bubble deform ation is 
important. As the breakup rate is proportional to 13ε, due to this functional 
dependence the estim ated breakup rate is hi gher if the diss ipation  rate history  is 
used rather than the m ean value.  Usi ng such history is only possible for Euler-  106

g−Lagrangian sim ulation in bubbl y flow. It should be noted  that we only account for 
the turbu lence-indu ced coalescence.  We cannot at present account for other 
coales cence phenom ena (e.g., wake induced  coalescen ce) due to the lack of 
suitab le ph ysica l models. A s illustrated in S ection 3.3.2 , if collis ion due to 
difference in bubbles relative velocities is included, the bubble coalescence rate 
could decrease. 
If the coalescence rate is reduced  by a factor of 10 in the sim ulation (i.e., 
, ), the simulated m ean bubble diam eter cannot reach 
equilibrium  in the colum n.  Therefore, breakup rates are enhanced by a factor of 10 (i.e., 
, Ω= ) in all th e sim ulations.   It is  important to em phasize that  
this factor of ten aros e as an  engineer ing estim ate and one could obtain “better” 
comparison against observed data by tweaki ng this factor.  By doing so, however, one 
loses the predictive nature of CFD, which is one of  the m ain purposes of numerical 
simulation. Thus, the factor by whic h breakup is  multiplied is fixed at 10 for all the c ases 
in this thesis. Most im portantly, the m ismatch in m agnitude of available breakup and 
coales cence closures ind icates that th ese cl osures need to be developed further. 10.0original
In Figure 5. 3 the com puted tim e-and azim uthally averaged  liquid ax ial velocity 
profiles, Uz(r), are compared again st the d ata obt ained by CARPT for the operating 
conditions reported in Table 4.6. Different  breakup-coalescence closures of Table 5.1 
used in the com putation are indicated in the legend of each figure. W ilkinson’s (1 991) 
model is used to calc ulate the assum ed single bubble size (without B PBE 
implementation), which can be written as: 
0.44 0.34 0.22 0.45 0.11 0.023bl l g dg U σµρρ−− −=   (5.1) 
where g is gravity, σ is su rface tensio n, lµ is liqu id phase v iscosity, lρ and gρ are 
liquid and gas phase density, respectively, and gU is superficial gas velocity. Thus, the  
simulation without BPBE rem ains predictive as the bubble di ameter is calculated from   107 
 
 correlation rather than “tweaked ”. The com pared profiles are fo r the m iddle sec tion of  the

The general shape of the velocity profile is well captured and the discrepancy in 
the model predicted and CARPT-measured  time-averaged axial liquid velocity 
diminishes as one moves radially outwards in the column. The computed time-averaged 
liquid velocity from the crossover point to the wall is well predicted while the 
experimentally observed values in the core  region are overpredicted. The simulation 
results for large diameter column (D = 44 cm ) are in better agreement with data than 
those for small diameter column (D = 19 cm ). The observed difference between the data 
and predicted velocities could be  due to the turbulence model ( k-ε model) used in the 
simulation which assumes isotropic unbounded turbulence. Figure 5.3b and Figure 5.3d 
illustrate that, with or without bubble popul ation balance equation implemented, the 
simulated liquid velocity profiles are simila r in bubbly flow regime  where breakup and 
coalescence phenomena are not important .  In the churn-turbulent flow regime (Figure 
5.3a, Figure 5.3c and Figure 5.3e) wher e breakup and coalescence phenomena are 
important , the liquid velocity profiles obtained from simulations with bubble population 
balance equation implemented are closer to data than those based on an assumed single 
bubble size obtained from correlation.  This is especially true in  the core region.  However, 
the effect of different bubble breakup and coalescence models on the simulated liquid 
velocity profile is largely insignificant. In all five cases, the simulated centerline liquid 
velocities are over-predicted wh ich could be due to the natu re of the 2D axisymmetric 
simulation. As mentioned earlier, there are si gnificant instantaneous radial and azimuthal 
liquid velocity components which cannot be captu red in 2D axisymmetric simulation.  If 
the pertinent physics is properly modeled, the actual instantaneous mean energy of liquid flow, which is acquired from air due to ga s-liquid momentum exchange, and in reality 
contains contributions from axial, radial and azi muthal velocities, must be the same in 2D 
axisymmetric simulation which contains only co ntributions from the axial velocity.  This 
implies that the axial liquid velocity in the 2D axisymmetric simulation has to be over-predicted which is what is seen in all the cases studied.

One m ay notice that our predic tion of the tim e-averaged li quid ax ial velocity  that 
is based on the m ean bubble size assum ption without involving th e BPBE seem s worse 
than reported in other studies presented in the op en lite rature.  This is du e to the f act that 
our com putation based on the m ean bubble si ze assum ption rem ains predictive as the 
bubble diam eter used as input is calculated fr om Wilkinson’s (1991) correlation. In fact, 
one m ay tweak the input bubble diam eter to obtain a “better” fit, as i llustrated in Figure 
5.4, and this adjustm ent of the single bubble si ze is what is used by other authors whether 
they adm it to it or not. The m ean bubble diam eter used in Figure 5.4 is 8.5 mm , and the 
calculated m ean bubble diam eter from W ilkinson’s (1991) corre lation is 4.5 mm . 
In Figure 5. 5 the com puted tim e-and-azim uthally averaged  liquid k inetic energ y 
(obtained by solution of the k-ε model in the s imulations ) prof iles a re compared against 
data obtained by CARPT. In the churn-turbul ent flow regim e (Figure 5.5a, Figure 5.5c 
and Figure 5.5e), kinetic energy profiles ty pically exhibit a m aximum around the cross-  112 
 
 over point for the time-averaged liquid axial velocity, due to larg e gradients and large 
fluctuations in the liquid velocity. In the bubbly regime this effect is not very significant 
(because of suppressed turbulence) and the li quid turbulent kinetic energy is practically 
flat as a function of radius. These effects ar e clearly captured in the simulation results 
presented in Figure 5.5b and Figure 5.5d. For all the cases, the simulations with bubble 
population balance equation implemented give better prediction of data  especially in the 
churn-turbulent flow regime. The impact of di fferent breakup and coalescence closures is 
not significant for turbulent kinetic energy prediction. Turbulent kinetic energy obtained 
from the two-phase k-ε  formulation arises from the turbulence microscale, while that 
obtained from experiments like CARPT arises from the larger scales. (For example, it is 
estimated that the “CARPT tr acer particle” cannot respond to  the turbulence fluctuations 
above 20-25 Hz in frequency.) It seems that a meaningful comparison of kinetic energy 
cannot be made as they are not of the same  scale. However, as illustrated by Sanyal  et al. 
(1999), in the present type of  axisymmetric simulations, th e “turbulent” kinetic energy 
(i.e., all the flow energy that is  not due to the mean flow) is forced to represent the large 
scale turbulent kinetic energy as measur ed by CARPT. In other words, the 2D 
axisymmetric simulation imposes all the turbulence time scales smaller than the total 
averaging time to contribute to the turbulen t kinetic energy at the “microscale” (hence, 
captured by the k-ε model). One also should expect a reasonable comparison of the 
overall kinetic energy profiles if the mean velocity profile and gas holdup profile are 
reasonably predicted.

In Figure 5.6 the typical com puted tim e-and-azim uthally averaged gas holdup 
profiles in churn turbulent flow regim e are com pared against the data ob tained by  
Com puted Tom ography (CT). The assum ption of cylindrical axi-symm etry in the 
computation prevents lateral m otion of the di spersed gas phase and leads to an unrealistic 
gas holdup distribution wherein a maxim um holdup is away from  the centerline, which is  
also reported by other authors (e.g. Krishna  et al., 2000).  A pparently, in order to get rid 
of this “hu mp” prof ile, full three -dimensional sim ulation m ay be necessary to obtain 
more realistic radial gas holdup profiles.  The predicted gas holdup obtained from 
constant m ean bubble size sim ulation is higher in the core region and lower in the wall 
region than that ob tained from  simulation with bubble population balance equation 
implemented. One of the reasons could be due to the fact that the local m ean bubble size   116 
 
 in the  core  region is la rger than in  the wall region, which is captured by BPBE,  as 
illustrated in Figure 5.7 . In the co re region of the bubble c olumn, gas holdup is h igher, 
while dissip ation rate is  low er, which resu lts in larger bubbles because of the higher 
coales cence rate and lo wer breakup  rate.  On  the othe r han d, gas ho ldup is low er while 
dissipa tion rate is high er in th e wall region,  which results in sm aller bubbles because of 
the lower coalescence rate and higher brea kup rate. Although the e ffects of breakup and 
coalescence closures on the predicted gas holdup,  liquid axial velocity  and kinetic energy 
are not significant, their eff ect on the predicted S auter m ean bubble size is apparent (see 
Figure 5.7).

In Figure 5.8, the effect of break up and coalescence cl osure on the bubble 
volum e-based p.d.f. is illustrated. It can be  seen that the effect of these drastically  
different breakup m odels (Luo and Svendsen, 1996; Martín ez-Bazán  et al., 1999a; b) are 
substantial.  Martínez-Bazán et al.’s (1999a; 1999b) m odel produ ces significantly fewer  
smallest bubbles and more largest bubbl es, and the bubble size distribution is 
significantly narrower as com pared with Luo and Svendsen (1996). Rigorous local 
experim ents are needed in order to test thes e availab le break up and coalescence clo sures. 
In Figure 5.9a and F igure 5. 9b the com puted tim e averaged  interfacial area dens ity is  
display ed.  The effect o f BPBE on the com puted  interfacial area densit y, which is of great 
interest in bubble column industrial opera tion, is significant (~ 100% difference). 
Unfortunately, there is no experim ental data available at pres ent for the interfacial area 
density distribution.  The significant differe nce between the sim ulated interfacial area 
results m entioned earlier suggests that BPBE may be necessary when  gas-liquid transfer 
needs to be considered.   118

 One would expect that wit hout well-predicted gas hol dup profile, the bubble size 
distribution profile and Saut er m ean bubble diam eter cannot be accu rately p redicted 
because gas holdup is needed in the breaku p and coalescence clo sures. However,  
qualitative c onclusions m ay still be  possible.  In Figure 5.10 the com puted evolution  of 
the local S auter m ean bubble diam eter in th e centerline is illust rated. In the churn-
turbulent flow regim e, the Sauter m ean bubble diam eters are stabilized  after 1 - 2 colum n 
diam eters as  the breakup  and coales cence rea ch equilib rium , while this is  not the cas e in 
bubbly flow. Moreover, it seem s that the co alescence rates are ove r-predicted in the 
bubbly flo w regim e. This is exp ected b ecause the bubb le net birth  rate is rou ghly 
proportional to ()13 13 13exp12 3 g g KK K αεε εα− −+  according to the cu rrent breaku p and 
coales cence m odels used in this  work. Th e exponential dependen ce of the co alescence 
rate (i.e. ()13 13exp2 3 g K Kε εα− ) on the local turbulent dissipation rate leads to 
coalescence dom inating the bubb ly flow sim ulation. Howeve r, the curren t breakup and 
coales cence models are devel oped based on bubbles imm ersed in a h ighly turbu lent field  
which m ay not be applicable in bubbly flow .  Improved breakup and coalescence closures 
in bubbly flow regim e need to be developed. On the other hand, as illustrated earlier, one  
may not need to im plem ent BPBE in the bubbl y flow regim e simulation at all as the  
bubble size distribution is  narrow and all that is needed is the prediction of mean bubble 
size. 
In Figure 5.11a and Figure 5.11b, the evol ution of cross-sectional bubble class 
volum e based p.d.f. is presented. F or churn-turbulent flow (U g = 9.6 and 10 cm /s), the  
bubble class distribution stabilized after 1.5 - 3 colum n diameter. It seem s that the bubble 
size d istribu tion in bigg er diam eter colum n needs m ore height to reach a stable profile 
(60 cm in 44-cm  diam eter colum n and 40 cm in 14-cm diam eter column for U g about 10 
cm/s), however, the effect is no t sign ificant.

 5.2.1 Summary 
Reasonable agreement in trend was obtaine d between the experimental data and 
two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations fo r the time-averaged axial liquid velocity 
profiles, as well as for the ki netic energy profiles. It is found that the model predicted 
coalescence rate and breakup rate  are out of balance by an order of magnitude (the former 
being the larger).  To match experimental  evidence the breakup ra te was increased by a 
factor of ten.  The unrealistic time-averaged gas holdup profiles arise due to the nature of 
two-dimensional axisymmetric  simulations and suggest th at full three-dimensional 
simulation is needed. Better ag reement with data is obtain ed with the Bubble Population 
Balance Equation (BPBE) implem ented, especially in the c hurn-turbulent flow regime, 
compared with the simulation using a cons tant mean bubble size. The difference in 
predicted interfacial  area densities, with and without BP BE implemented, is significant. 
The choice of current availa ble bubble breakup and coalesce nce closures does not have 
significant impact on the simulated results. BP BE is necessary for churn-turbulent flow 
simulation when interfacial area density information is important. 
 
5.3 Three-Dimensional Simulation 
From two-dimensional axisymmetric simu lation, it is found that the choice of 
current available bubble breakup and coales cence closures does not have significant 
impact on the simulated results. Therefore, in the following investigations, only Luo and 
Svendsen’s (1996) breakup and Luo’s (1993)  coalescence model are implemented. 
During this stage of simulation, the level of the interface is monitored. An 
indication of the quasi-steady state is a dynami cally stabilized interface. We also monitor 
the velocities, both for gas and liquid phase, at  some representative points in the column, 
as indications of flow deve lopment. Generally it takes about 60 - 100 seconds for the 
simulation to reach the quasi-steady state de pending on the superficial gas velocity as 
well as the diameter of the column. Once the fully developed, quasi-steady state is   123 
 
 reached, the tim e-averaged quantities are calcu lated. In all sim ulations the velo city and 
gas holdup f ields are sampled every 0.05 - 0.1 second. To ensure the convergence of the 
averaged quantities the averaging processe s are perform ed for 80 - 120 seconds. The 
spatial averaging is then perform ed along the ve rtical direction within  the m iddle sections 
of the column.

Figure 5.14 shows the com parison of the simulated and experim ental tim e-and-
azim uthally averaged axial liq uid (water) velocity profiles and gas holdup profile of a 44-
cm diam eter colum n at 10 g cms=U  superf icial g as velocity. The sim ulated resu lts are 
axially averaged in the fully developed regi on (from  z = 89 cm to 170 c m). Three types of 
models (closure im plementations) m entioned earlier are im plem ented: 1) BPBE in t wo-
fluid m odel with velocities of all bubbles assum ed to be locally equal to gas phase 
ensem ble local av erage d veloc ity; 2) BPBE in A SMM w ith velo cities  of all bub bles 
assum ed to be locally equal to gas phase ense mble local averaged v elocity (ASMM, SV); 
and 3) BPBE in ASMM with N+1 phases such  that different size bubbles have different 
local velocity calculated from  the ASMM (AS MM, DV). It should be noted that we only 
account for the turbu lence-induced coalescen ce in this work becau se the tu rbulent  
induced  coalescen ce efficien cy m odel m ay not be applicab le. A s illus trated in Se ction 
3.3.2, if bubble relative velocities differen ce induced collision is included, the bubble 
coales cence rate could d ecrease. 
The sim ulated profiles are com pared to data for the m iddle section of the colum n 
where the mean flow is one-dim ensional. Th e tim e-and-azimuthally-averaged gas holdup 
profile and liquid axial velocity profile are well predicted for all three types of 
implementations, especially with closure 1 and 3. The choice of the multiphase flow 
model and of population balance closures do not have a significant effect on the 
simulated results as illustrated in Figure 5. 14.  Gas holdup radial pr ofile prediction w ith 
closure type 3 (bubbles with di fferent velocities in ASMM) is a little lower and closer to 
the observed CT data than that of closure type 2 (bubbles with identical velocity in 
ASMM).  Tim e-averaged liquid velocity radial profile prediction with closure type 3 is a 
little steeper and clos er to the CA RPT data than  that with closure typ e 2.  The effect of 
the choice of population balance closure is not significant. Besides,  it is easier to 
implement different drag laws and pressure e ffects in the two -fluid m odel. Therefore, in 
what follows, only the r esults of  the two-fluid model are presented.   127 
 
 4.5 mmB=Figure 5.15 shows the com parison of the e ffect of BPBE on the tim e-averaged gas 
holdup and liquid velocity profile prediction. Euler-Euler two-fluid m odel fram ewor k is 
used. W ilkinson’s (1991) m odel is used to calculate the assu med single bubble size 
(d ). The shape of the predicted gas ho ldup and liquid axial velocity profile 
via assum ed mean bubble diam eter is flatter th an the experimental data and the sim ulated 
results obtained from  simulation with BPBE  implem ented. The predicted gas holdup 
profile with single m ean bubble diam eter b ecom es worse as one m oves towards the wall 
region, and the liquid axial velocity profile  becom es wors e as one moves towards the 
core region. Previous inve stigation s (e.g. K rishna et al. , 2000) also show n that th e gas 
holdup and liquid axial velocity profile cannot  be predicted well sim ultaneously by two-
fluid m odel with assum ed mean bubble diam eter.

In the  open  litera ture, the s imulated liqu id axial v elocity radial p rofiles a re 
norm ally shown without being given exact ax ial locations, and are believed to reach a 
plateau in the fully developed region.  Fo r two-dim ensional axisymm etric sim ulation, 
such perfectly flat p lateau doe s exis t as illustra ted in Figur e 5.16a. However, such p lateau 
is not found in three dim ensional sim ulation. Moreover, the liquid axial velocity 
evolution trend obtained from  2D and 3D si mulation are signi ficantly different .  Before 
reach ing the plateau, th e liqu id axial velo city obtained fro m 2D si mulation exh ibits a 
strong overshoot which was not observed experi mentally (Degaleesan, 1997), while the 
trend obtained from  3D si mulation qualita tively ag rees with the  experim ental 
observations (e.g. Figure 5.17) . The 2D sim ulation overpredict ed liquid axial veloc ity at 
the centerline in the fully developed region by about 5% and 3D si mulation 
underpredicted it by about 5%. As m entioned ear lier in previous se ction, the 2D axi-
symmetric s imulation ca uses the liqu id flow to develop very quickly (5 -10 s of real tim e)   129 
 
 and reach its long-tim e “stea dy” pattern without lateral motion. Thus the m omentum 
carried by g as phase  can be transf erred in ax ial direction on ly. In add ition, the ga s holdup  
predic ted by  2D axi-sym metric sim ulation is h igher in the cen ter reg ion, a nd low er in the 
wall region, than th at predicted  by 3 D simulation. These tw o factors (m omentum  transf er 
and buoyancy) result in higher liquid axial velocity predic tion than obtained in 3D 
simulation. Figure 5.16 b illus trates the tim e-averaged liq uid axia l velocity prof ile 
evolution in the fully develope d region obtained from  the 3D simulation. The varia tion is 
not significant (around ±5%), while the trend is  apparent.  Sim ilarly for the sim ulated gas 
holdup profile, there is sm all variation (around ±5%) at different axial locations in the 
fully developed region, as illustrated in Figure 5.18.

 Figure 5.19 shows the tim e-and-azim uthally averaged gas holdup profile in a 
16.2-cm  diam eter column operated at 8 and 14 g cms U=  in an  air-therm inol-glass 
beads ( 150 mµ) slurry system . The solids loading is 9. 1%. The slu rry phase is assum ed 
to be pseudo-hom ogene ous, thus two-phase (air and slurry) flow rather than three-phase 
(air, therm inol and glass beads) flow is si mulated. The apparent viscosity of the slurry 
phase is calculated by E instein’s viscosity for dilute suspension: 
()*2 5112ssO µµ αα⎛⎞=+ + ≈ ⎜⎟⎝⎠.08 cP  (5.2) 
The slurry d ensity is calculated as 
()*1 1015  ss s t kgm ραραρ =+ −≈3 (5.3) 
and the slu rry phas e surface ten sion is es timated as Therm inol surface tension  (17 
dyne/cm ). The apparent density and viscosity of  the slurry m ixture are close to water,  
while its surface tension  is m uch lower than that of water. The gas hold up profile is  well 
predicted for both superficia l gas velocity conditions.

cross-sectional integral of th e product of experim ental tim e-averaged liquid axial velocity 
and tim e-averaged liquid holdup,  ll zeuα , has negative values (Ong, 2003). This m ass 
“imbalance”  is negligib le in 2D  axisym metric sim ulation (C hen et al. , 2003) because the  
axisymm etric boundary condition in 2D com putations causes the liquid flow to develop 
very quick ly (5-10 s of real tim e) and reach its long-tim e “steady” pattern (Sanyal  et al. , 
1999; Chen  et a l., 2003).  In other words, the fluctuation of liquid holdup and axial 
velocity is artif icially e liminated in  such  sim ulation. H owever, in r eality and in 3D  
simulations,  such f luctuations can be significant at high supe rficial gas v elocitie s (e.g., 30

provide the needed fluid dynam ics to m odels ranging from  single param eter axial 
dispersion model to two dim ensional convec tion with eddy diffusi on model (Degaleesan,

models, the preservation of the continuity  condition for the gas and liquid phase is

that m atters in bubble co lumn reactor m odeli ng.  Thus the holdup weighted liquid  (water)

norm al stres s, the num erical valu es are sign ificantly low er than the ex perim ental data.  
This is  due to m odel’s in ability of  resolving al l the f luctua tions as the tur bulence  leve l is

the disc repancy betw een the sim ulated results and  the exper imental da ta is still sign ificant, 
the relative difference is not as large as that for the radi al and angular norm al stress, and 
the difference becom es sm aller as one m oves towards the wall.  In Figure 5.25b, the

 significantly underpredicts the tu rbulent shear stress.  S imilar behavior was found in

flow regim e, is not able to fully resolve the fluctuating liquid velocity in the churn-
turbulent flow regim e (Pan and Dudukovic, 2001).

In Figure 5.30, the simulated cum ulative  bubble volum e fraction is given.  The 
summation of  the volu me fraction  of all bub ble c lasses  is equa l to the sim ulated gas  
holdup, thus if the sim ulated overall gas holdup is underestim ated, the cumulative bubble 
volum e fraction will m ost likely be underestim ated as well.  Si milarly, if the sim ulated 
overall gas holdup is overestim ated, the cum ulative bubble v olume fraction will also  be   148 
 
 most likely overestim ated.  Thus, for fair comparison, each  bubble class volum e frac tion 
needs to be weighted agains t the experim ental gas holdup. This weighting procedure can 
be w ritten as :

Here, we made the assumption that th e increase/decrease of overall gas holdup 
would not change the bubble volume fraction base d distribution.  As the relative error of 
the sim ulation against the experi mental overall gas holdup, as we ll as the adjusting factor, 
is sm all (see  Table  4.7), it m ay be a valid  assum ption.  I t can be se en th at the cum ulative  
volum e fraction of sm aller bubbles (up to 6.4 mm) does not change w ith the superficial 
gas veloc ity (10 and 30  cm/s) w hile it incre ases with resp ect to the op erating pre ssure, 
which is in  line w ith the tw o-bub ble-c lass hypothesis (e.g., Kris hna and Ellenberger, 
1996).  Nevertheless, a bim odal bubble size dist ribution is not found in the sim ulation as  
shown in Figure 5.31.  The ope rating pressure does not have a noticeable effect on the 
simulated bubble size distribution, which re sults from  breakup and coalescence closures 
used in this work which do not take the pres sure effect into account. The superficial gas 
velocity has little effect on volum e fraction of sm all bubbles  (1 and 1.6 mm), while such 
effect becom es pronounced for larger bubble s.  The bubble size distribution becom es 
wider and the Sauter m ean bubble diam eter beco mes larger as the supe rficial gas velocity 
increase.  T he sim ulation suggests that al though the volume fraction of s mall bubbles 
may not change w ith r espect to th e superf icial gas veloc ity in churn -turbu lent f low 
regim e, the bubble size distribution rem ains single m odal and sim ply becom es wider and 
moves towards larger bubble diam eter when supe rficial gas velocity inc reases.  This is in 
line with observations reported by Fan et al.  (1999) in high pressure s mall diameter 
colum n. Bimodal bubble size distribution postu lated by Krishna and Ellenberger (1996) 
is not seen in any of our si mulations or in data by Fan et al. (1999).   149

5.3.1 Results and Conclusions 
The num erical s imulation of the transien t gas-liquid flow in  three-dimensional 
cylindrical bubble columns using the Euler-E uler two-fluid model (TFM) and the ASMM 
with BPBE im plemented is able to capture  the dynam ic features of  the large-scale 
structures.  The tim e-averaged liquid velocity field exhibits single l oop axi-symm etric re-
circu lation pattern in  the m iddle section  of the colum n. Such flow pattern had  been  
confirm ed experim entally by the liquid velo city m easurem ents, which used Com puter 
Automated Radioactive  Partic le Tr acking te chnique, in various columns operating at 
churn turbulent flow conditions. The evid ence, both num erical and experim ental, 
supports the assum ption of one-dim ensionality w ithin the m iddle section of the colum n of 
the tim e-ave raged veloc ity prof ile, in  the se nse of ti me- and azim uthal-averaging, and in 
turn the use of one-dim ensional re-circula tion m odel widely adopted in engineering 
applic ation s (Degale esan et al. , 1996b; Degaleesan  et a l., 1997; Gupta  et al. , 2001a). 
Quantita tive com parisons w ith the experim ental (CT/CA RPT) data dem onstra te tha t, by 
applying inter-phase m omentum  transfer, m odified kε− turbulen ce m odel in  the liqu id 
phase, and the BPBE for the bubble size predic tion, the two-fluid and ASMM sim ulations 
are able to provide satisfactory m ean axia l liquid velocity and gas holdup profile for  
colum ns operated over a wide range of superf icial v elocity, operati ng pressure, physical 
properties, and colum n diam eter.  By co mparing the computed and experim entally 
determ ined turbulence intensitie s (auto corr elations of the liquid ve locity f luctuatio ns) 
and the Rey nolds she ar stres s (cross correla tion of  the liqu id veloc ity fluctuations),  we 
find that for colum ns operating in the churn tu rbulent regim e the velocity field cannot be  
fully resolv ed w hich re sults in a u nderestim ated predic tion of the f luctuations re lated 
mean quantities. Th e sim ulation co rrectly cap tured qua litatively the  elevated pre ssure 
effect on bubble colum n flows which pushes the churn-turbulent flow  towards bubbly 
flow when pressure is increased, and sugge sts that although the vol ume fraction of sm all 
bubbles m ay not change with respect to the su perficial gas velocity in churn-turbulent 
flow regim e, the bubble size distribution st ill rem ains single m odal but becom es wider 
and m oves towards larger bubble diam eter when  superficial gas veloc ity is increased.    152 
 
 For truly predictive results in simulation of  gas-liquid flows in churn turbulent regime 
one needs to continue exploring the models for momentum exchange, bubble 
breakup/coalescence, and the models for multiphase turbulence.

6.1 Introduction 
One of the primary tasks in the current methodology of  bubble column design 
involves description of the degree of mixing of each of the involved phases (e.g., axial 
dispersion model), which is subsequently used along with reaction kinetics to estimate 
the reactor performance viz.  the conversion, yield and sele ctivity.  The advantages of 
using phenomenological models, using paramete rs obtained from transient fluid dynamic 
models of the column, have b een demonstrated (Degaleesan et al. , 1996b; Degaleesan, 
1997; Gupta et al. , 2001a). Thus, the time-dependent  velocity field is needed for 
calculating the convection and turbulent disper sion of the passive scalar in the liquid 
and/or gas phase. 
One of the major objectives of our ongoi ng modeling and dynamic simulation of 
bubble column flow is to study the liquid/ga s dispersion and mixing.  The widely used 
one-dimensional axial dispersion  model requires the effectiv e axial dispersion coefficient 
for which no suitable accurate  correlation has been found to  date. On the other hand the 
two dimensional convective-diffusive model re quires axial and radial eddy diffusivities 
and the liquid velocity profile. It was demonstrated that such a model, with the velocity 
profile and eddy diffusivity values provided from the Comp uter Automated Radioactive 
Particle Tracking (CARPT) studies, can predict well the independent ly measured liquid 
tracer exit age density function (Degaleesan  et al., 1996b; Degaleesan  et al. , 1997) in 
bubble column of the same size. This implies that such a model can  accurately predict   154 
 
 (,)lt ux (,)gt (,)gtreactor perf ormance of such a bubble colum n for the first order reaction schem es and is a 
model of choice for m ildly nonlinear reactions . However, the param eters of the m odel 
need to be supplied which, if based on experi mentation, is a very expensive and tedious  
proposition. Therefore, we attem pt here to  obtain the modeled param eters by three-
dimensional num erical sim ulation of the flow field and tracer spreading . In the p resent 
study, we v erify the cap ability of th e dynam ic tracer sim ulation for the evaluation of the 
averaged liq uid turbu lent diffusivity.   
 
6.2 Computational Models 
Before a tracer sim ulation is started, one needs to generate a fully developed 
turbulent liq uid/gas v elocity f ield inside th e bubble colum n. The two-fluid m odel, with 
bubble population balance equation im plemented, is adopted to dyna mically sim ulate the 
buoyancy driven flow. The details of the m odel and im plem entation have  been illus trated 
in Chapter 4  and Chapter  5. 
 
6.3 Numerica l Tracer Experiment 
The three dim ensional dynam ic simulati ons f or the cylindrical bubble colum ns 
operated at various conditions can then be  perf ormed by using FLUENT, in which the 
Euler-Eu ler model is im plem ented. Such sim ulations gen erate fully de veloped flow fields, 
i.e. , ux , αx (,)lt  and αx. The tra cer s imulations c an then be  started. If  
we use some type of passive scalar, say C, as the local tracer con centratio n for the liq uid 
phase, the convection-diffusion equation for C is given by

 2 g g

where we use S to denote the local gas phase tracer concentration. These equation s, i.e. 
Equation (6.1) and (6.2), which are also im plemented, are the n solved, to gether w ith the  
Euler-Euler model equations, to generate the tracer concentr ation as a f unction of time  
and loc ation in the co lumn,  and , for the liquid and ga s phase, respectively. 
Since in bubble colum ns the dispersion of passi ve scalars are dom inantly controlled by 
turbulence, the m olecular diffusivities,  and (,) C tx (,) Stx

are given zero value during the sim ulations. It  should be em phasized here that during the 
tracer sim ulation the fluid dynam ic equations are still being solved continuously. Since 
the tracers are passiv e scalars, their existence in the colum n, either in liquid phase or in  
gas phase, do not change the fluid dynam ics at all. 
Assum ing axisymm etric flow filed in  a bubble colum n and neglecting the 
molecular d iffusivity, Equation (6.1 ) can be conv ert in to the f ollowing form, in term s of

6.4 Numerica l Particle Tracking Experiment 
The dispersion of passive scalars by con tinuous motion in tur bulent flows evolved 
as a m ajor filed of research, particularly during the recent years, due to industrial and 
environm ental issues o f utm ost im portance rela ted to the energy cris is, pollu tion 
spreading and the need to im prove plant design for two- or multi-phase  flow processes. In 
the design o f bubble colum n reacto rs, liqu id pha se m ixing is one of the important factors 
that not only governs the residence tim e distribu tion of the liquid, but also affects that of 
the gas phas e, and in ad dition, d etermines the mean driv ing force for mass tran sfer. As is 
well known, turbulence largely enhances the transport and m ixing of a ny passive scalar 
released to a continuous m aterial phase. The rates of transfer and m ixing in the presence 
of turbulence are orders of magnitude la rger than the  rates due to m olecula r trans port   159 
 
 alone. The most common m ethod of dealing with equations governing turbulent flow is  
by treating the diffusive nature of tur bulence via the introduction of a turbulent 
diffusivity for a given quantity. This is us ually done using the gradient model, based on 
the well-known Boussinesq's hypothesis, wh ich represent the correlations between the  
fluctuating velocity vector and scalar, i.e. ''Cv with the product of eddy di ffusivity and 
the ensem ble averag ed concentration . With a suitable dif fusivity, such a m odel appea rs in 
the averag ed m ass balance equatio n as a diff usive term . However, the turbulen t eddy  
diffusivity that appears in the resulting eq uations is itself  unknown and needs to be  
modeled. T his app roach was introduced in  the prev ious s ectio n by equation (6.4) and 
(6.5). i
While m olecular dif fusivity is cau sed by the Brownian m otion of molecules, the 
turbulent ed dy dif fusivity is natura lly related to the Lagrang ian turbu lent motion of f luid 
particle s. Measurem ents and sim ulations of  fluid particle’s  velocitie s and  trajectories, in a 
Lagrangian fra mework, are theref ore n eeded for the study of  the turbulent eddy 
diffusivity. The Com puter Autom ated Radio active Particle Tracking (C ARPT) technique 
is capab le of record ing the Lagrangian trajecto ry of a trace r particle tr aveling throug h the  
entire colum n in a reasonable period of ti me. The Lagrangian turbulent eddy diffusivities 
are then d irectly evaluated from  such data. Si milarly, num erical particle tracking can be 
perform ed in a velocity field generated by the dynam ic simulations of the transient gas-
liquid flow in bubble colum ns. Th e num erical particle trajector ies can then also be used 
to calcula te the Lagra ngian turbu lent eddy diffusivitie s. In this s ense there is no 
difference b etween the CA RPT data and the da ta from num erical particle track ing.  
However, there has b een no gener ally e stablished relation ship tha t relates the 
eddy diffusivities, arising from  the Boussinesq's gradient  approximation, with the 
turbulent eddy diffusivities de fined in the Lagrangian fram ework. In an isotropic and 
homogeneous turbulence field, it has been  shown, by usi ng scale argum ents and by 
comparing the probability dist ribution f unction f or the spread of  partic les w ith the  
solution of the turbulent convective diffusion e quation, that the diffusivity appearing i n   160 
 
 the convection-diffusion equation can be approximated by the Lagrangian based turbulent 
eddy diffusivities (Tenneke and Lumley, 1972). Even without such a relation, the 
Lagrangian information deduced from a CARPT experiment directly reveals the 
characteristics of the dispersion process in the liquid phase and can be utilized to study 
and model the effect of fluid dynamics on liquid phase mixing in bubble columns. 
In this chapter we evaluate the Lagra ngian turbulent eddy diffusivity in bubble 
columns by utilizing the numerical particle tracking. We compare the diffusivities from 
CARPT measurement with the ones from nume rical simulation. Such comparison also 
serves as a validation of the numerical predictions arising from the two-fluid simulation 
of bubble column hydrodynamics. As stated earlier, we have completed the three-
dimensional dynamic simulations for bubble columns of three sizes and operated at 
different superficial gas velo cities and compared the time-averaged quantities with the 
data from CARPT experiments. From these simulations, we choose one case for particle 
tracking simulation: 44-cm diameter column ope rated at superficial gas velocity of 10 
cm/s. The simulations start from fully developed flow fields. Unlike the CARPT experiment, where the technique is able to follow a single tracer particle only, 
numerically, there is no limit on the number of particles that can be traced simultaneously. 
Typically, 1440 initially  randomly seeded particles are fo llowed in a simulation.  The 
dynamic simulation of the fluid flow field continues while th e particle-tracking is being 
performed. For the cases reported here th e simulation ran 60 seconds and the sampling 
frequency for the particle trajectory wa s 50 Hz. The numerical particle tracking 
experiment thus records 4,320, 000 particle occurrences, which is about the same as in a 
CARPT experiment. CARPT data processing algorithm (Degaleesan, 1997) is used to 
obtain the turbulent eddy diffusivity. The equations  are listed in Table 6.1.   161

6.5 Results and Discussions 
To ensure an accurate evaluation  of the ed dy dispersion coefficients, th e 
numerical tracer s imulation can on ly be started when the flow  field of the colum n reaches  
a sta tistically quasi- steady sta te. Since the  tracer disp ersion in th e ax ial d irection  is 
largely controlled by th e mean axial m oment um and its fluctuation, we calculated the  
time- and azim uthal-av eraged p rofiles of  the liquid axia l velocity, zu, and the axial 
turbulence intensity, ''uuzz . Pan (1999) conducted num erical tracer experim ent in 
bubbly flow and the predicted cross-sectional axial eddy diffusivity compared well with 
the experimental data obtained  via CARPT (Table 6.2). In th is study, w e focused on eddy 
diffusivity prediction in the ch urn-turb ulent flow regim e. The num erical tracer 
experim ents were conducted for the 44-cm  diameter colum n operated at Ug = 10 cm /s and 
16.2-cm  diam eter column operated at Ug = 30 cm /s.   162

tracer cann ot escape the co lumn. The trac er concentration, therefore, eventually  
approaches a uniform  pattern. On the other ha nd, the gas tracer, as sho wn in Figure 6.3,  
eventually exits the co lumn. One can also observe the downwards dispersion of the gas 
tracer due to the carrying of gas bubbles by liquid back flow near the wall region.   164

 6.6 Summary 
The methodologies for numerical tracer  and numerical pa rticle tracking 
experiment are illustrated. The fully devel oped three dimensional flow field obtained 
from numerical simulation (Chapter 4) can  be used for such purpose.  CFD model 
currently cannot fully resolve the fluctuating liquid velocity, especia lly in the horizontal 
plane,  in the churn-turbulent flow regime, thus the radial turbulent eddy diffusivity is 
significantly under-estimated. Ne vertheless, the axia l turbulent eddy diffusivity can be 
estimated by the three dimensional dynamic simulations with reasonable accuracy.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
7.1 Conclusions 
In this work, we incorporated the kn own breakup and coalescence models via the 
bubble population balance equati on (BPBE) into the Euler-E uler model and ASMM to 
improve the gas holdup, liquid velocity, surf ace area per unit volume and Sauter mean 
bubble size prediction in the churn- turbulent flow regime. It should be noted that much of 
the physics is uncertain in this complicated flow regime. The previous BPBE 
implementations are few and focused on bubbly flow, where bubble breakup and 
coalescence effects on holdup and velocity distributions are ma rginal. In this work, we 
systematically investigated th e effect of incorporating BP BE in CFD simulation of both 
bubbly and churn-turbulent flow. Quantitativ e comparison of model predictions was 
performed with experimental data whenever  possible. The following conclusions were 
reached: 
Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulation of gas-liquid bubble column flow can 
provide reasonable agreement w ith experimental data for the time-averaged axial liquid 
velocity profiles, as well as for the kinetic en ergy profiles. However, this requires that the 
model predicted breakup rate be increased by a factor of ten to matc h the coalescence rate 
in order to establish the experimentally obser ved invariance with axia l position of radial 
gas holdup profile in the fully developed region (about two column diameters above the sparger). 
There are a number of possi ble reasons for the mismatch  in magnitude of model 
predicted breakup and coalescence rates.    169 
 
 1) The bubble breakup rate a nd daughter bubble p.d.f. m easurem ents are done in 
dilute system s, and m ay not be applicable  in churn-turbulent flow regim e where 
gas holdup is high. 
2) In this study the energy di ssipation rate is obtained by the kε− model and only 
accounts for sm all scale energy dissipati on. In other words, the predicted 
dissipation rate, ε, is underpredicted. The m odel pr edicted breakup rate increases 
linea rly w ith 13ε, the co llision ra te also incre ases linea rly w ith 13ε, but the 
coalescence efficiency d ecreases exponen tially with 13ε. Thus, if th e en ergy 
dissipation rate is underpredicted, then th e coalescence rate m ay be overpredicted 
and the breakup rate is underpredicted. In a ddition, as illustrated in Section 3.3.2,  
if collision of bubbles due to  relative velocities difference,  neglected at present, is 
superim posed on the turbulence in duced collis ion, the bu bble coalescence rate 
would decrease because the coalescence efficiency decreases as the bubble 
collision sp eed increases.  
3) The estim ated breakup tim e (measured fr om the onset of bubble deform ation to 
the tim e of actual break up), bτ, and coalescence tim e (measured from  the instan t 
when two bubbles collide with each other to the tim e when they unite into one 
bubble), cτ, are larger by  an orde r of m agnitude than the time step  used in the 
simulation ( ~ 5 m s). Theref ore, it is  assum ed implicitly in th e sim ulation  that the  
dissipation rate ε at time  to tbtτ+ (or ctτ+) is the m ean dissipa tion rate to  
which break ing (or co alescing) bub bles are exp osed to in th e turbulent flow field.  
Turbulence induced coalescen ce occurs due to  eddies with sizes larg er than o r 
equal to the sizes of  the colliding bu bbles . The coalescence tim e scale however is  
determ ined by the liquid physical properties, bubble diam eter and the 
characteristic size of the e ddies that induced th e collis ion. T herefore, the history 
of the dissipation rate surr ounding the bubbles af ter this collision is not important 
for the coalescence rate estim ation. However, this is not the case for bubble 
breakup rate estim ation. The breakup is  induced by the eddy bom bardm ent. The 
bubble breakup rate is determ ined by all the incom ing eddies reaching the bubble   170 
 
 surface during the bubble deform ation. Thus,  the histo ry of dissipation rate 
surrounding the bubbles from  the onset of bubble deform ation is im portant. As  
the breakup  rate is pro portion al to 13ε, due to this functional dependence the 
estim ated breakup rate is higher if the dissi pation rate history is used rather than 
the m ean value.  Us ing such histor y is only possible for Euler-Lagrangian 
simulation in bubbly flow. It shou ld be noted  that we o nly accoun t for the 
turbulence-induced coalescence. We ca nnot at present account for other 
coales cence phenom ena (e.g., wake induced  coalescen ce) due to the lack of 
suitab le ph ysica l models. A s illustrated in S ection 3.3.2 , if collis ion due to 
difference in bubbles relative velocities is included, the bubble coalescence rate 
could decrease. 
Due to the nature of two-dim ensional axisym metric sim ulations, th e unrealistic 
time-averaged gas holdup profiles arises, wh ich suggests that fu ll three-dim ensiona l 
simulation is needed  to captu re the  gas-ho ldup prof ile. Bette r agr eement w ith data is  
obtained with the Bubble Population Balance Equation (BPBE) im plemented, especially 
in the churn -turbu lent flow regim e, com pared with the sim ulation using a constant m ean 
bubble size. The difference in predicted interf acial area densities, w ith and without BPBE 
implemented, is significant. The choice of  currently available bubble breakup and 
coalescence closures does not have significant impact on the sim ulated results. BPBE is 
necessary for churn-turbulent fl ow simulation w hen inte rfacial area dens ity inf ormation is 
important. 
The widely used drag force form ulation (e.g., Schiller and Naum ann, 1935; Ishii 
and Zuber, 1979; Tsuchiya  et al., 1997) , do es not accou nt for the effect of elevated 
pressure. Krishna and van Baten (2001a) propo sed in the drag form ulation as density 
corre ction  factor, the  ratio of  gas d ensity at o perating and atm ospheric 
pressure,,1 g gatmρρ . However, the introduction of such  a correction factor signif icantly 
over-predicted the overall gas holdup at highe r superficial velocity and higher pressure 
(e.g., 30 , 0.6 gUc msP MPa = = ). For that reaso n, the d ensity co rrection factor is   171 
 
 reduced in this study to ( . Although there is not e nough experim ental data 
to draw a conclusion regarding the exponent in  this density correction f actor, it is f ound

The shape of the predicted gas holdup and liquid axial velocity profile via  
assum ed mean bubble diam eter in 3D si mulation is flatter than the experim ental data. In 
contras t the sim ulated re sults ob tained from simulation w ith BPBE im plem ented are  in 
good agreem ent with data. The predicted gas holdup profile with single m ean bubble 
diam eter becom es worse as one m oves toward s the wall region, and the predicted liquid 
axial v elocity prof ile bec omes worse as  one m oves towards the core region. 
The num erical s imulation of the transien t gas-liquid flow in  three-dimensional 
cylindrical bubble columns using the Euler-E uler two-fluid model (TFM) and the ASMM 
with BPBE im plemented is able to capture  the dynam ic features of  the large-scale 
structures.  The tim e-averaged liqu id velocity  field exhibits a si ngle loop axisym metric 
recirculation  pattern in the m iddle section  of the colum n. Such fl ow pattern had been 
confirm ed experim entally by the liquid velo city m easurem ents, which used Com puter 
Automated Radioactive  Partic le Tr acking te chnique, in various columns operating at 
churn turbulent flow conditions. The evid ence, both num erical and experim ental, 
supports the  assum ption of one-dimensiona lity of the tim e-averaged  velocity profile, in  
the sense of tim e- and azim uthal-averaging, wi thin the m iddle section of the colum n and 
in turn the use of  one- dimensional re-c irculation m odel widely adopted in engineering

are able to provide satisfactory m ean axia l liquid velocity and gas holdup profile for  
colum ns operated over a wide range of superf icial v elocity, operati ng pressure, physical 
properties, and colum n diam eter.  In this study, the drag fo rce is calculated based on local 
mean bubble size obtained from  the local bubb le population distributio n. The drag force    172 
 
 can also be calculated from the whole local bubble population. The effect of these two 
different drag force calculation methods on th e simulated results is not significant. By 
comparing the computed and experimentally  determined turbulence intensities (auto 
correlations of the liquid ve locity fluctuations) and the Reynolds shear stress (cross 
correlation of the liquid velocity fluctuations ), we find that, for columns operating in the 
churn turbulent regime, the ve locity field cannot be fully resolved which results in a 
underestimated prediction of th e fluctuations related mean quantities. The simulation 
correctly captured qualitative ly the elevated pressure e ffect on bubble column flows, 
which pushes the churn-turbulent flow toward s bubbly flow when pressure is increased. 
It suggests that the volume fraction of sma ll bubbles does not change with respect to the 
superficial gas velocity in churn-turbulent flow regime . The bubble size distribution 
remains single modal but becomes wider an d moves towards larger bubble diameter 
when superficial gas velocity is increased.  For truly predictive results in simulation of 
gas-liquid flows in churn turbul ent regime one needs to conti nue exploring the models for 
momentum exchange, bubble breakup/coalescence, and the models for multiphase turbulence. 
In this study, the virtual mass and lift force are neglected. The virtual mass was 
neglected by most authors or found to be negl igible in Euler-Euler simulation, and in the 
churn-turbulent flow regime, large bubbles do not have a closed wake and the concept of added mass is not applicable (Sankara narayanan and Sundaresan, 2002; Tomiyama  et al. , 
2002). The main reason for neglecting lift forces is that the lift force due to bubble deformation in strong shear flow fields, which is the most important and relevant lateral 
force in gas-liquid flow, has not been well mode led and is not available even for a single 
bubble. In the literature (Sankaranarayanan and Sundaresan, 2002) the lift force 
coefficient is not only related to the bubble di ameter, but also to the local shear stress 
field to which the bubble is exposed. Moreover, a negative lift force coefficient is reported for large bubbles and in strong shea r fields (Kumar, 1994). Another reason is 
that the lift force is less important in magn itude than the drag force. However, it should   173 
 
 ,,rzbe noted that the lift force com pone nt in the horizontal plane m ay not be negligible in a 
region of large velocity gradient. 
From  the computed flow field, the m agnitude of virtual m ass and lift f orce in the 
churn-turbulent flow regim e can be estim ated. If the lift force coeffi cient and virtual mass 
coefficient are both equal to 0.5, then the calculated drag force is about one order of 
magnitude larger than the virtua l mass force in all direc tion (θ). In the axial direction, 
the drag force is at least two orders of m agnitude la rger than the lif t force. In the 
horizon tal plane, the ca lculated d rag force is abou t the sam e in m agnitude  as the lif t force. 
It should be noted that the above estim ates are based on com puted instantaneous 
velocities which are underestim ated by about a f actor of three com pared to experim ental 
values. Hence, predicted rad ial and azi muthal liqu id norm al stresses are also 
underpredicted by a factor of ten. T he instanta neous gas velocity and slip velocity in the 
horizon tal p lane m ay also be und erestim ated b y a similar factor. Thus , the drag  force,  
()3l
4d gl D lg l g
bCdραα= − M uu−uu,  in the ho rizontal p lane may still be  the dom inant 
force, if the com puted slip ve locity in the horizo ntal plan e, ()r,lgθ−uu , is underestim ated 
by a factor of three. The lift force m ay be im portant as well. It s hould be emphasized that 
the above order of m agnitude analysis of the different forces rests on the assum ption 
, which m ay not be true in churn-turbul ent flow regim e. Moreover, it is found 
experim entally (e.g., Kum ar and Ra mkrishna, 1996b) that the gas holdup radial profile 
can be expressed as: 0.5LC=
() (2122m
GGmcmc) εξε ξ+⎛ ⎞=−⎜ ⎟+−⎝⎠  (7.1) 
where m  is an indication of steepness of the gas holdup profile . In churn-turbulent flow 
regim e (e.g., ). Most exp erimental da ta ind icates m  = 2 w hile m ≈ 3 by the 
3D simulation in this w ork. This su ggests th at incorpora tion of BPBE itself  may not be 
enough for accurate g as holdup d istribution p rediction, and  inclusion  of radial lateral 
force m ay still b e needed . 30 cm/sgU=  174 
 
 The procedure for num erical tracer and num erical particle tracking experim ent are 
illustrated. The f ully developed th ree dim ensional f low field obta ined from num erical 
simulation can be used for such purpose.  CF D models curr ently canno t fully resolv e the 
fluctuating liquid velocity, especially in the hor izontal p lane,  in th e chu rn-turbu lent flow 
regim e, thus the radial turbulent eddy diffu sivity is signif icantl y under-estim ated, by 
about a factor of six. In contrast, the axia l turbulent eddy diffusivity can be estim ated by 
the three dim ensional dynam ic simulations with reason able accu racy. For reactor 
modeling, convective and axial dispersion ti me scales are thus predicted correctly , 
improve ment is needed for the radial dispers ion tim e scale. 
 
7.2 Recomm endations 
Suggestions for extending the work conducte d in different parts of this study are 
listed below : 
• It should be noted that the density co rrection factor used in this study, 
()0.25ρρ,1 gg atm , is an eng ineering estim ate. It needs to be v alidated with m ore 
experim ental data or based on theor etical calculations. 
• The fluctuating velocity com ponents are not well captured in this  work. In order to 
capture better the sm all scale s tructure in bu bble column flows, Large Eddy  
Simulation (LES) is desirable. 
• The m ismatch in order of m agnitude of  current breakup and coalescence closures, 
which is found in this work, suggests that  new breakup and coales cence closures are 
needed.  
• In this study , the v irtual mass force and th e lift force are neglect ed as in line  with 
the work of m ost other investigators.  Although the physics is uncertain, from    175 
 
 engineering point of view, it is  desirable to study the eff ect of these two forces on  
the sim ulated results in c hurn-tu rbule nt flow. 
• It may be desirab le to implem ent more recen t BPBE solution m ethods, such as the 
moving pivot techn ique (Ong, 2003) for im prove d accuracy. 
• As the velocity and holdup evolution in 2D and 3D sim ulation are significantly 
different, it is desirable to confirm  whet her the effect of different breakup and 
coales cence closures are also ins ignificant fo r 3D sim ulation as they were shown in 
the 2D sim ulation. 
• A more rigorous validation of the BPBE  model, breakup and coalescence closures 
is needed. Although it is very dif ficult,  if not im possible, to obtain bubble size 
distribution data in churn-tu rbulent flow experim entally, via the four-point optical 
probe, the bubble chord-length  distribution can be obtai ned and can serve as a 
valuable validation for the BPBE model.  Moreover, there is no gas phase axial 
velocity data available in th e open litera ture at p resent.  Such  data ob tained from the 
four-point probe can not only validate ge neral multiphase CFD  models, but also 
provide needed inform ation, together w ith the CARPT technique, for drag force 
formulation under churn-turbulent flow re gime and/or at elevated pressure.  
• The com puted correlation between li quid holdup and liquid axial velocity, ''t
llz
suα , 
as illustrated in Chapter 5, suggests th at higher local instantaneous gas holdup is 
correlated with higher local liquid axial velocity. Moreover, the magnitude of  
''t
llz
suα  decreases with the operating pre ssure, which suggests that higher 
operating pressure suppresses chaotic fl ow in bubble colum ns. The opposite sign 
for the liquid holdup and liquid velocity correlation, ''t
llz
euα , is obtained from  the 
CARPT-CT data (Ong, 2003). This leads the conclusi on that high gas holdup   176 
 
 correlates with low liquid velocities which is not supported by other evidence. 
Moreover, the m agnitude of the e xperim ental data based ''t
llz
euα  incre ases with 
pressure, implying that chaotic behavior is  prom oted by higher pressure. This calls 
for reexam ination of experim ental data. CARPT-CT m easurem ents on the sam e 
colum n at different gas velocities should be perform ed. The  effect of the m aterial of 
the co lumn wall and  the effect of  particle  settlin g veloc ity (e.g., use of  different siz e 
tracer pa rticle) on the res ults shou ld be carefully exam ined.
