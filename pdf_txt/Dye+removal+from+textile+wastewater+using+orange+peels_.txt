ABSTRACT  
The main objective of the work is the study of adsorption of dye solution acid yellow using low cost adsorbent like orange 
peel. It is the batch adsorption studies are carried out for observing the effect of initial concentration, effect of adsorbe nt dosag e and 
adsorption isotherm. Optimum conditions for dye removal are studied like contact time required, amount of adsorbent and dye 
concentration. Spectrometry technique was used for the adsorption equation. The equilibrium time was found to be 140 hours fo r 
different concentration of dye solution. A maximum removal of 94% was adsorbed in the 50mg/l of dye solution for an adsorbent  
dosage of 6g. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained from Langmuir equation was 10.69. The result generated by this can be used 
for determination of optimum condition for adsorption of dye in aqueous solution.  
Keywords : Adsorption, Langmuir, Acid yellow, Dye removal.  
INTRODUCTION  
Dyeing is one of the fundamental operations in the textile industry irrespective of the fiber material  or processes adopted. 
Dyeing is generally carried out in aqueous phase. The dyes are retained on the substrate by physical adsorption, mechanical r etention 
or by formation of covalent chemical bond. About 56% of the total dye production is consumed in the  textile sector. Textile dye effluents 
are complex in chemical nature, highly coloured and are most often bio -degradable, inhibitory and exhibit toxicity to both aquatic and 
non-aquatic biota. Colour acquired by a water body through the discharge of colour ed effluent inhibits growth of the desirable aquatic 
biota necessary for self -purification by reducing penetration of sunlight and consequent reduction in photosyntheticc activity and 
primary production. Due to high absorption capacity of solar energy in t he visible range of the spectrum, coloured water limit the active 
aquatic biota to a narrow depth which consequently reduced the self -purification capacity of the stream. Recent survey indicates that 
approximately 12% of synthetic dyes used each year are l ost during manufacturing and processing operations and that 20% of these 
dyes enter the environment by means of processing effluents. Dyes are almost invariably hazard, their removal form effluent s tream is 
ecologically necessary. The dye effluents also sp oil; the quality and quantity of the yield in the agriculture. The discharge of highly 
colored effluents into natural water bodies is not only aesthetically displeasing but also retards light penetration thus red ucing the 
dissolved oxygen content of the dy es can cause skin irritation, allergic dermatitis, cancer and mutation in human beings, Of all the dyes 
available basic dyes were found to be brightest class of soluble dyes used by textile industry.  
Materials and methods  
Preparation of adsorbent:  Orange p eel was collected from the local fruit stall. The peel was first washed to remove the adhering dirt 
and then were dried, crushed, and sieved. They were dried in sunlight for 42 hour. After drying they were crushed and sieved through 
100 mesh size. Acid yel low dye was used in this study and the chemical structure of the dye was shown . The orange peels were collected 
and dried in the sunlight for 48 hrs.  The dried orange peels were cut in to small pieces and then crushed using mortar and pestle.  The 
crushed o range peels were sieved through 100 mesh size.  Some dried orange peels burnt in the atmospheric air to make carbonized 
adsorbent. This experiment was conducted in the batch process. The batch adsorption experiments were conducted to study optim um 
removal of color from textile wastewater. The adsorption study was conducted with different concentration of dye solution. The dye 
solution was taken in the 250 ml conical flask and the conical flask was kept in the orbital shaker in room temperature at 12 0 rpm. T he 
adsorption study conducted to determine the effect of time and effect of adsorbent dosage.  
Effect of initial Concentration and adsorbent dosage:  To study the effect of time with the different concentration of wastewater 
like 25, 50, 75,100 mg/l. The effect of initial concentration was investigated for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 days at optimum pH 6.5. H ere it is 
found out the best ratio of colour removal wit h respect to time. The different dosage of adsorbent namely orange peel taken such as 
2g, 4g,6g, 8g, and 10g with 50mg/l waste water in the 250 ml conical flask in orbital shaker in room temperature at 120rpm. T o know 
the effective adsorbent dosage the rea dings were investigated for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 days.  
RESULT AND DISCUSSION  
To study the effect of initial concentration on efficient removal of textile wastewater the study was carried out. The wastew ater 
sample was taken in a 250 ml conical flask with  diffe rent concentration such as 25, 50, 75,100 mg/l and its kept in an orbital shaker in 
room temperature at 120 rpm. The sample was withdrawn from the beaker at the predetermined time interval. The effect of initi al 
concentration was investigated for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 days at optimum pH 6.5 and the results are compared with original colour concentration 
of wastewater to know the colour efficiency of adsorbents. It is clear from the result that times play an important role in d ye removal 
from wastewater. The opti mum time required for the colour removal is 144 hours for orange peel. The representation of graph was 
shown below.

Effect of contact time on adsorption was studied and the graph was shown. From the figure it is  indicated that efficiency 
increases with increase in contact time between adsorbent and the adsorbate. It can be attributed to the fact that more time becomes 
available for the dye to attraction complex with the orange peel. Therefore it is concluded that  dye and orange peel should be in 
contact for 140 hour in order to get maximum removal.

pH Value: 6.9):  
From the effect of initial concentration it is found out that best concentration i.e. maximum amount of dye removed from the 
wastewater was noted down and effect of adsorbent dosage experiment was carried out for that investigated sample. Different a dsorbent 
doses like 2g, 4 g, 6g,  8g and 10g were taken in 250 ml conical flask and kept in an orbital shaker in room temperature at 120 rpm. Using 
the value the graph was plotted. It was found that adsorption found decreases further with increase in dosage.

the adsorbent percentage is increased from 2g to 6 g for 50mg/l solution. At low amount of dosage higher uptake was obtained. The 
graph shows that the, above 6g of dosage the removal percentage is decreased. So 6 g of adsorbent indicates the optimum amoun t.

CONCLUSION  
The effect of dye concentration was studied by keeping the adsorbentdosage constant at 5g and the concentration of the dye wa s in 
thedifferent range such as 25, 50, 75, 100 mg/l . maximum dye adsorptionwas obtained 94.8% at 50mg/l dye concentration.To investigate 
the effect of adsorbent dosage, the adsorption of acidyellow on to the orange peel was measured at the 50mg/l dye solutionwit h different 
adsorbent dosage like 2g, 4g, 6g,  8g and 10g. In thisstudy 6g of adsorbent adsorb the dye more than the others adsorbent dose.
