abstract
In order to study the availability of canola residue for biosorption of acid orange 7 (AO7) from aque-
ous solution, batch experiments were performed for thermodynamic and kinetic studies. Physical 
characterization of canola samples was determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scan-ning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller. The equilibrium adsorp-
tion data were analyzed using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Langmuir isotherm was well 
fitted with the experimental adsorption data. Kinetic analysis were performed using pseudo-first order, pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion models. The kinetic analysis indicated that 
the adsorption kinetic data of AO7 fit better to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. In addition, 
the existence of three steps were observed during the adsorption experiment. The first stage rep-resented the transport of AO7 molecules from the surface to pores of the adsorbent external struc-
ture. The second stage showed invasion of the molecules into the internal structure of the adsorbent. 
The adsorption of the molecule on the interior surface of the adsorbent was the last step. The ther -
modynamic data obtained at different temperatures were used to calculate standard free energy 
changes (∆G °), standard enthalpy change (ΔH °), and standard entropy change (ΔS °). All ΔG ° values 
are ranged from –4.987 to –0.045 kJ/mol; ΔH ° and ΔS ° values of canola biomass were 29.62 kJ/mol and 
0.107 J/mol K, respectively. Based on the calculation, adsorption of AO7 onto canola biomass was a spontaneous and endothermic process.

1. Introduction
Synthetic dyes in wastewaters are from various industrial 
sources (e.g., textile, leather, cosmetics, paper, electronics, 
printing, plastic, pharmaceutical, food, etc) [1,2]. Anionic azo 
dyes contain many compounds from various classes of dyes. Acid Orange 7 (AO7) used in special areas such as leather 
dyeing and paper coloration [3]. Like most other azo dyes, it tends to be disposed of in industrial wastewater and poses 
a severe health threat to humans. It is highly toxic, and its ingestion can cause eye, skin, mucous membrane, and upper respiratory tract irritation; severe headaches; nausea; water-borne diseases [4].
As the synthetic dyes are toxic with the wastewaters 
many harmful and carcinogenic chemicals can be transported easily to the other streams and rivers [5]. The discharge of D. Balarak et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 190 (2020) 331–339 332
dye-bearing wastes without any treatment into the natural 
streams and rivers not only affects their aesthetic nature but also interferes with the transmission of sunlight and there-fore reduces the photosynthetic activity and creates severe problems for the aquatic life, food web [1]. In some cases, the color wastewater can also endure anaerobic removal to form potentially carcinogenic compounds that can end up in the food chain [6].
Therefore, well-controlled management of these waste-
waters is required and it is a reasonably vital issue to meet the national discharge standards [7]. There are several tech-niques (e.g., aerobic or anaerobic digestion, coagulation, advanced oxidation processes and adsorption) to remove the color from wastewaters [8,9]. They are not usually elim-inated by conventional methods of wastewater treatment in the wastewater treatment plant because of the complex structure [10].
It has been proven that the adsorption is a highly effi-
cient and relatively low-cost technique for the treatment of wastewaters containing dyes [8,11]. Generally, activated carbon and resin shave been commonly used to adsorptive removal of dyes. However, adsorption processes with these materials have some disadvantages, requiring high costs associated with their subsequent treatment and regenera-tion [12,13].
Thus, this problem leads to the urgent development of 
novel and cost-effective adsorbents. Recently, various bioad-sorbents such as agricultural and animal waste have been applied to remove dyes from wastewaters [14,15]. Since the agricultural adsorbents showed good performance due to having high specific surface area and little internal diffusion resistance, these materials have drawn much attention in recent years. Lignin and cellulose are main constitutes in agricultural residues [16,17]. Agricultural residues also include hemicellulose, lipids, proteins, glucose, starch, water, hydrocarbons and other compounds [18,19] which can combine with pollutants by replacing hydrogen ions or by forming complexes with pollutant ions [20].
Canola waste can be considered as a recommend -
able adsorbent because carboxylic and hydroxyl groups of the canola waste have a great affinity for dye ions [21]. Furthermore, it is inexpensive, abundant and easy to pre-pare [22,23]. Thus, the main objectives of this study are: (a) to investigate removal capacity of AO7 dye by canola, (b) to determine the influence of factors including contact time, temperature, initial AO7 dye concentration on the dye removal efficiency, and (c) to analyze thermodynamics and kinetics of the adsorption.
2. Materials and methods
AO7 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., US, and 
its chemical structure of AO7 is C
16H11N2NaO4S (molecular 
weight 350.32 g/mol) (Fig. 1). No purification for AO7 was 
conducted before the experiments. All AO7 solutions were prepared using deionized water. Canola residue was used as an adsorbent for the removal of AO7 dye from aqueous solutions. The canola stem was taken from the research farm in the Tabriz Agricultural School. Then the taken residues were washed several times with deionized water until dirt particles were washed out. This washing procedure had been continued until the washed water was colorless, and then the washed residues were dried at 50°C for 12 h. The dried materials were ground using steel mill and sieved through 
1–2 mm sieve. After the ground particles were sieved then 
they were treated with 0.1 M HCl for 5 h. Next they were 
washed with deionized water and dried. The final biomass 
was used in the adsorption process in this study.
2.1. Characterization of dried canola biomass
An ASAP 2000 apparatus was used to determine the 
specific surface area of canola, and the analysis was based 
on nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K. An 
environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) instru-
ment (Philips XL30 ESEM-TMP , USA) was used to take 
micrograph of canola biomass before and after adsorption. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer (Philips-X’Pert Pro MPD) was used to examine the changes in a crystalline 
phase, and the conditions of the XRD were following: gener -
ator voltage of 40 kV , tube current of 40 mA, scan step size of 
0.02°, and the scan range of 5°–90°. To study the interaction between functional groups on the surface of dried canola and AO7, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic 
measurements were conducted using Nicolet 5700 instru-
ment, Thermo Corp., USA, in wavenumbers ranging from 
400 to 4,000 cm
−1.
2.2. Batch adsorption studies
The stock solution of AO7 (1,000 mg/L) was diluted to 
prepare initial AO7 solutions with different concentrations. The pH of the initial solutions was adjusted by using 0.1 M H
2SO4 and 0.1 M NaOH solutions. A specific amount of bio-
sorbent was put to a 50 mL polypropylene tube after 20 mL of AO7 solution was added at the desired pH. The tube was stirred at 180 rpm for 90 min at 293 K. The equilibrium times 
were estimated at four different temperatures (273, 288, 303, and 318 K) when AO7 concentrations in the samples were consistent. When the equilibration time was over, the solution was centrifuged at 3,600 rpm for 10 min to have supernatant. Then it was analyzed for AO7 using a UV-Spectrophotometer (DR-2800) at λ
max 452 nm which was obtained in preliminary 
tests. The content of AO7 on dried canola biomass was calcu-lated by the difference between the initial and final AO7 con-centrations in the supernatant. All batch experiments were conducted three times.
The adsorption capacity at the equilibrium, q
e (mg/g), was 
estimated by Eq. (1) [22]:

2.3. Desorption studies
Desorption of adsorbed AO7 from canola biomass was 
studied with four types of the solvent including deion-ized water and different concentrations of sodium chlo-
ride (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 N). Pre-adsorbed canola biomass 
was taken in 100 ml of the above-mentioned solvent and shaken at 120 rpm for 90 min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis indicated 
that the surface area of the treated canola was determined 
as 72.5 m
2/g. Fig. 2 displays the examination of dried 
canola before and post adsorption using ESEM. Before adsorption, there was the pore textural structure of dried canola. In contrast, clear pore textural structure was not observed after adsorption due to either agglomeration on the surface or the incursion of AO7 into the pores of dried canola. Table 1 represents the chemical compositions of the canola. The canola was mainly composed of the C, O, H, and N of which accounted for 91% of the total weight (w/w). The other minor components were Si (3.6%), K (3.1%), Ca (1.1%), P (0.7%), and Mg (0.5%). XRD patterns of the dried canola (a) before and (b) after adsorption showed a quite similar diffused peak with a maximum at 2θ = 21.2° and 21.5°, respectively (Fig. 3). However, due to AO7 biosorption, dried canola after adsorption shows a higher intensity on the surface of dried canola. To under -
stand the interaction between functional groups on the 
surface of the dried canola and AO7, FT-IR analysis was 
performed before and after adsorption. The FT-IR spectra 
of the dried canola were not changed, showing a similar 
pattern and the same number of observed peaks before and after adsorption (Fig. 4).
The overlap of O–H and N–H stretching vibrations 
resulted in the broad peak at 3,431.1 cm
−1, suggesting that 
surface free hydroxyl groups and chemisorbed water were presented [24]. At 2,918.2 and 1,391.2 cm
−1, the peaks showed 
correspondence to the C–H symmetric stretching vibration of the methylene groups (–CH
2) and deformation vibration of 
methyl groups (–CH3). At 1,629.4 cm−1, the peaks attributed 
to a C=O stretching vibration of carboxylate (–COO−) or N–H deformation vibration of amide I groups. At 1,265 and 1,041 cm
−1, the peaks were because of the C–O stretching 
vibration of ketones, aldehydes and lactones or carboxyl 
groups [25]. However, some shifts in wavenumbers from 
3,431.1 to 3,419.2 cm−1, from 1,629.4 to 1,632.6 cm−1, from 1,265 
to 1,271.5 cm−1, and from 1,041 to 1,048.6 cm−1 were attributed 
to the spectra of dried canola before and after adsorption. This change of wavenumbers indicates the possibility that amide, hydroxyl, carboxylate and C–O groups could partici-pate in AO7 biosorption on the surface of canola [26].

3.2. Adsorption isotherms
Fig. 5 displays the adsorption isotherms of AO7 on canola 
at 273, 293, 313 and 333 K, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, 
equilibrium uptake increased with increasing AO7 concen-trations. This result indicates that the concentration gradient was the driving force for the adsorption reaction [27]. When the concentration of AO7 increases, the active sites of canola will be surrounded by much more AO7 ions, causing favor -
able adsorption [28].Therefore, the increase in q
e resulted 
from an increase of AO7 concentrations. From Fig. 5, the adsorption capacity of AO7 onto the canola was 24.23 mg/g at 293 K. Even though this amount is not greater than that of other adsorbents, it has other advantages such as cost-ef-fective preparation from natural material. The increase of the adsorption with increasing temperature indicated that the adsorption of AO7 ions onto canola was an endothermic process.
The Langmuir and Freundlich equations were used to fit 
the isotherm data. The Langmuir adsorption model is repre-sented by its linear form [29] Eq. (3).
C
qq KC

em Le
m=+1 (3)where Ce (mg/L) is the equilibrium concentration, qe (mg/g) 
is the amount of adsorbed adsorbate per unit mass of adsor -
bent at equilibrium, qm (mg/g) is adsorption capacity, and 
KL (g/L) is the Langmuir constants. The Langmuir adsorp-
tion model presumes that interaction between the adsor -
bate molecules does not occur, and the model explains monolayer adsorption. When C
e/qe was plotted against Ce, a 
straight line with slope 1/qm was obtained (Fig. 6). This result 
indicates that the adsorption of AO7 on canola follows the Langmuir isotherm. This isotherm data were used to esti-mate the Langmuir constants K
L and qm, which are shown in 
Table 2. Another important parameter (RL), separation factor 
or equilibrium parameter, is determined from the following equation [30] Eq. (4):
RKCL
L=+1
10 (4)
where KL (L/mg) and C0 (mg/L) represent the Langmuir con-
stant and the initial AO7 concentration, respectively. The adsorption process is irreversible when R
L is 0 and linear 
when RL is 1. When RL is between 0 and 1, the adsorption 
process is favorable while it is unfavorable when RL is greater 
than 1. The RL values estimated from the Eq. (4) were between 
0 and 1, suggesting that the Langmuir adsorption was favor -
able (Table 2).
The Freundlich isotherm model assumes that differ -
ent sites with several adsorption energies are involved. Freundlich adsorption equation as following [31] Eq. (5):
logl og log qnCKee F=+1
 (5)
where qe and Ce are the adsorbed amount at equilibrium 
(mg/g) and the equilibrium concentration of the AO7, respec-tively. K
F and n are Freundlich constants. KF (mg/g(L/mg)1/n) is 
the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and n indicates how favorable the adsorption process. It has generally stated the n values that range 2–10 represent good, 1–2 represent moder -
ately difficult, and less than one represents poor adsorption characteristics. The n value from the equation was greater than 2, implying the canola was good adsorbents for the AO7.

The slope 1/n plays a role as a scale of adsorption intensity or 
surface heterogeneity, and the adsorption becomes more het-erogeneous as it is closer to zero. The straight line with slope 1/n was given from the plot of log q
e vs. log Ce which was 
displayed in Fig. 7. The constants (KF and n) of the Freundlich 
model were calculated by Eq. (3) and listed in Table 2 includ-ing the Langmuir constants. The adsorption of the AO7 to the dried canola was proven to fit better with the Freundlich isotherm based on the correlation coefficient (Table 2). The amount of maximum monolayer uptake capacity of AO7 dye by canola biomass was obtained at 42.87, 45.35, 48.73, and 52.35 mg/g at temperatures of 273, 288, 303 and 318 K, respec-tively. This amount has been compared with q
m achieved from 
the other studies for the removal of AO7 dye. Table 3 shows the maximum uptake capacity from the Langmuir model by various sorbents.
3.3. Adsorption kinetics
Three kinetic models such as pseudo-first-order, pseu-
do-second-order and intra-particle diffusion models were 
chosen to elucidate the mechanism and rate-controlling step during the adsorption process. The pseudo-first-order equa-
tion is expressed below [41,42]:
logl og.qq qKtet e−() = () −1
2303 (6)where qe (mg/g) is the AO7 adsorption capacity at equilibrium, 
qt (mg/g) is the amount of adsorbate removed at time t (min), 
and K1 (min–1) is the rate constant of the pseudo-first-order 
reaction. Fig. 8 illustrated that the qe and K1 values can be cal-
culated by the slope and intercept of the plots of log (qe – qt) 
vs. t. The linear plots of log (qe – qt) vs. t at various concentra-
tions with the correlation coefficients (R2) higher than 0.932 
is a suggestion that adsorption of AO7 on canola predomi-
nantly succeeds the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, but the experimental values of q
e, exp (mg/g) are nowhere near the 
calculated qe, cal (mg/g).
The pseudo-second-order kinetic model can be expressed 
in linear form as follows [43, 44]:
t
q Kqt
qte=+1
22  (7)
where K2 (g/mg min) is the rate constant of the pseudo-sec-
ond-order reaction. The qe and K2 values were estimated 
from the slope and intercept of plots of t/qt vs. t which was 
displayed in Fig. 9. The linear plots of t /qt vs. t  at different 
concentrations were good with higher correlation coeffi-cients (R
2 = 0.995). This implies that AO7 adsorption onto 
the canola biomass comes behind the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The good linear plots of t /q
t vs. t  at different 
concentrations with the correlation coefficients (R2) higher 
than 0.995 suggest that adsorption of AO7 onto canola bio-mass fitted better to pseudo-second-order kinetic model. In addition, the calculated data (q
e,cal) has a remarkable agree-
ment with the experimental data (qe,exp). Table 4 showed the 
kinetic parameters.
The intra-particle-diffusion equation is shown below [45].
qK tIt=+05. (8)
A model proposed by Weber and Morris, other known as 
the intra-particle diffusion model proposes that the adsorp-
tion mechanism occurs due to the diffusion of adsorbate 
molecules into the adsorbent pores. The plots of qt vs. t1/2 are

in Fig. 10 and the values of K, C, and R2 are summarized in 
Table 4. As seen in Fig. 10, all the plots are disseminated in 
three individual linear segments that indicate three different stages.
The primary stage focuses on the diffusion of AO7 to the 
external surface of the dried canola or the boundary layer diffusion of adsorbate molecules. The second stage is about the gradual adsorption where the intra-particle diffusion that is, the rate-limiting step. The following stage is allocated to the equilibrium, where the intra-particle diffusion starts to decline because of the extremely low concentration of AO7 leftover in the solution that leads to rather lower K values for each stage. Moreover, both the second and third stages bypass the origin, thus explaining that the rate-limiting step of the adsorption process is not solely governed by intra-par -
ticle diffusion [46].3.4. Thermodynamic analysis
Effect of temperature on the adsorption of AO7 on the 
canola was assessed using the free energy change (ΔG°), 
enthalpy change (ΔH°), and entropy change (ΔS°). To assess the thermodynamic parameters using the following equations  [47–49], the Langmuir isotherm was applied:

where K, R, and T  are the Langmuir equilibrium constant

parameters at different temperatures. The negative values 
showed confirmation of the possibility of the process and the instantaneous nature of its adsorption. The decrease of ΔG ° 
values with a temperature increase suggests that the adsorp-tion process of AO7 on the dried canola is more apt to higher temperatures. The values assessed from the plot of ∆G ° vs. T 
were 29.62 and 0.107 KJ/mol K of ΔH° and ΔS °, respectively. 
It was suggested that the ΔH ° of physisorption is less than 
40 kJ/mol [50,51]. Based on ΔH °, adsorption of AO7 on the 
canola was regarded as a physisorption process. As the value of ΔH ° was positive, the adsorption reaction was regarded as 
an endothermic process. The positive value of ΔS ° reflecting 
the affinity of the dried canola for AO7 furthermore suggests certain structural changes in dye and the canola residue.
The best kinetic model is the pseudo-second-order 
model for the adsorption of AO7 on canola. In accordance, the rate constants (K
2) of the pseudo-second-order model 
were utilized to estimate the activation energy of the adsorp-tion process by applying the equation [52] below:
ln lnKKE
RTa
2=−  (11)
where K2, K, Ea, R, and T are the rate constants of the following 
respectively: the pseudo-second-order model (g/mg min), the activation energy (kJ/mol), the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K) and temperature (K). The activation energy reached 8.80 kJ/mol at a concentration of 100 mg/L, and the magnitude of 
activation energy gives information for the type of sorption. The two main types of adsorption are physical and chemi-cal process. Activated chemical adsorption shows that the rate tends to vary with temperature depending on the finite activation energy (8.4–83.7 kJ/mol) in the relevant equation. 
The activation energy is close to zero [53,54] in non-activated 
chemical adsorption. Therefore, ΔH°, ΔG°, and E
a values sug-
gested that adsorption of AO7 on canola was a physisorption 
process. The positive values of Ea suggested that adsorption 
may be an endothermic process.
In deionized water, only 24.5% AO7 pre-adsorbed onto 
canola biomass was desorbed, showing most AO7 to be strongly bond to the canola biomass. With added sodium chloride at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 N concentrations, significantly 51.37,% 68.6%, and 84.3% of adsorbed AO7 were released within 90 min. The enhanced AO7 desorption with increasing ionic strength is consistent with the electrostatic interaction mechanism of AO7 adsorption on canola biomass. At high ionic strength, the negatively charged canola biomass and positive charged AO7 would be screened by the respective Na
+ and Cl– counter ions, breaking their electrostatic bonds 
and releasing AO7 molecules [55].
4. Conclusion
This investigation was performed for an examination 
on the equilibrium and dynamic adsorption of AO7 on the 
dried canola. The adsorption experiments revealed that canola biomass was good efficient in adsorption of AO7 due to high specific surface area (72.5 m
2/g). Textural, morpho-
logical and surface chemistry characteristics were studied by nitrogen physisorption, BET, ESEM, FT-IR, and XRD. It was evident that the adsorption capacity increased with the increase of temperature. Adsorption data were fitted with the pseudo-first and pseudo-second-order kinetic equa-tions. The best method to describe the sorption kinetics was by the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation. An indica-tion of the thermodynamic analysis states that the adsorp-tion of AO7 dye on canola residual was instantaneous and endothermic. In addition, through a physisorption process, the adsorption of AO7 on the canola residual had occurred.
