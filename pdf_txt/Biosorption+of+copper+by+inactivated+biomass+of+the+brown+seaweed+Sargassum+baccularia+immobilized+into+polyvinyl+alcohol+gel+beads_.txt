ABSTRACT  
 
The biosorp tion of copper by inactivated biomass of the brown seaweed Sargassum baccularia , 
immobilized onto polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel beads, was investigated using a laboratory -scale packed bed 
column. Continuous -flow column  tests were performed to determine break through curves at two different 
column lengths. In both cases, a very broad trailing edge of the breakthrough curve was observed, 
indicating the presence of intraparticle diffusion resistance within the biomass beads. Such asymmet ric 
breakthrough curves co uld not be described by a simplified two parameter packed bed model. A positive 
aspect of the PVA -immobilized biomass was that its copper uptake capacity remained essentially unaltered 
over two consecutive cycles of adsorption -desorption. The biomass beads  could be regenerated for reuse 
with an aqueous solution containing 4mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The robustness and stabilit y of 
the immobilized biomass beads could lead to the development of an efficient and cost -effective 
bioremediation technolog y for the removal and recovery of toxic metals from aqueous solutions.  © 2002

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
In recent years increasing concern about the effect of toxic  metals on plant and animal life 
has led to the implementation of more stringent environmental regulations in many parts of the 
world for industrial and mining operations that discharge metal -bearing effluents. As a result, 
highly efficient metal removal t echnologies are needed to reduce the metal concentrations in 
wastewater to acceptable regulatory standards. Biosorption is one such technology that is 
gaining attention among environmental researchers.  
Biosorption exploits the ability of microbial and plan t biomass to sequester heavy metal ions 
from aqueous solutions by physicochemical mechanisms. Numerous species of nonliving 
biomass have been screened and studied extensively in the last decade with the aim of 
identifying highly efficient and selective met al removal biosorbents. For example, various 
species of seaweeds have been shown to possess impressive binding capacities for a range of 
toxic metal ions (Seki and Suzuki, 1998; Zhou et al. , 1998; Kim et al. , 1999; Malik et al. , 1999; 
Sanchez et al. , 1999;  Yu et al. , 1999; Davis et al. , 2000; Esteves et al. , 2000; Hamdy, 2000; 
Stirk and van Staden, 2000; Cabatingan et al. , 2001; Romero -Gonzalez et al. , 2001; Lee et al. , 
2002). Since design procedures as well as process equipment for conventional activated c arbon 
packed bed columns are readily available (Cooney, 1999), biosorption for full -scale applications 
can in principle be implemented using the packed bed configuration. It is therefore desirable to 
develop biosorption processes for metal removal based on  the packed bed configuration.

Although seaweed biomass in i ts native form has been used in packed bed studies 
(Kratochvil et al. , 1995; Costa and Franca, 1996; Yu and Kaewsarn, 1999), the biomass in 
general has a tendency to disintegrate and swell, causing operational problems such as 
clogging and pressure drop fl uctuations. To be of practical use, the biomass can be immobilized 
on porous solids to increase its mechanical strength (Chu and Hashim, 2001). The objective of 
this paper is to investigate the column performance of the brown seaweed Sargassum 
baccularia  immobilized in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel beads using copper as a model metal ion. 
PVA is a type of synthetic polymer that is readily available, cheap, and possesses strong 
mechanical strength and durability.  
 
 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
Samples of S. baccu laria were collected from the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The 
biomass was washed and dried to a constant weight. It was then ground and sieved to a size 
range of 250 -500µm. The resulting seaweed biomass particles were mixed with an aqueous 
solution of PVA (15% w/v) to produce a mixture with a solid -to-liquid ratio of approximately 
150g/l. The mixture was transferred to a syringe and released into a gently stirred saturated 
boric acid solution to form spherical beads of 0.35cm in diameter. The beads w ere then placed 
in a sodium phosphate solution (1.0M) for hardening, followed by washing with distilled water 
to remove residual chemicals (Chen and Lin, 1994). A scanning electron microscope (LEICA 
S440) was used to obtain microscopic images of immobilize d biomass beads.  
PVA-immobilized biomass beads were packed in a glass column with a diameter of 1.6cm. 
Two continuous -flow column tests were performed to determine breakthrough curves at 
different bed lengths (11 and 13cm). A copper solution of 20mg/l adj usted to a pH of 6 was 
pumped through the column at a flow rate of 1ml/min using a liquid chromatography pump 
(Perkin Elmer, USA). Samples were collected at the column outlet at fixed time intervals and 
analyzed for copper concentration using an inductivel y coupled plasma atomic emission 
spectrophotometer (Baird, USA).  
In the experiments comprising two consecutive cycles of adsorption -desorption to assess 
the performance of immobilized biomass beads under continuous flow conditions, the 
biosorbent column wa s first loaded with copper. Upon saturation, the feed flow was replaced 
with a distilled water flow to flush out any unbound copper from the column. An aqueous 
solution containing 4mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a strong metal chelating 
agent, was then pumped through the column to elute the bound copper from the beads. 
Samples were collected at the column outlet at fixed time intervals and analyzed for copper. At 
the end of the elution step, distilled water adjusted to a pH of 6 was pumped into the column to 
recondition the beads and to displace any remaining EDTA solution that might interfere with the 
next cycle of copper loading. The biosorption column, now free of copper and EDTA, was ready 
for reuse. The above experimental procedures constitu ted one cycle of copper loading and 
elution.  
 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
Figure 1 shows the experimental breakthrough curves for a feed containing 20mg/l copper 
obtained at two different bed lengths (symbols). Theoretical breakthrough curves calculated 
from a mathematical model are also included in Figure 1 (lines) and these are discussed later. 
The results are plotted as the ratio of the effluent concentration ( Ce) to the influent 
concentration ( Ci) versus time. The shape of the breakthrough profile is d etermined by the shape 
of the equilibrium isotherm and is influenced by the individual transport processes taking place 
in the flowing liquid phase as well as in the immobilized biomass beads. Figure 1 shows that the 
breakthrough curve shifted towards the origin with increasing bed length. For short times (2 -3h) 
copper in the feed was taken up completely by the column. As expected, the curve for the 
shorter  column  showed a shorter clear period (i.e., undetectable effluent copper concentration).

In both cases, a very broad trailing edge of the breakthrough curve was observed and the time 
required for complete saturation of th e column was in excess of 35h.

Mathematical models are useful for design and optimization studies since they help reduce 
time-consuming and repetitive experiments. An excellent summary of theoretical mode ls for 
predicting breakthrough curves of columns packed with spherical adsorbents has been given by 
Ruthven (1984) and several of these models adapted for the design of activated carbon packed 
bed adsorbers for wastewater treatment are well covered in the recent book of Cooney (1999). 
In the general case a mechanistic model considers axial dispersion in the direction of the liquid 
flow, film diffusion resistance, intraparticle diffusion resistance which may include both pore 
and surface diffusion, and sorpt ion kinetics at the adsorbent surface. Because of the nonlinearity 
associated with equilibrium expressions, a full solution of the resulting set of partial differentia l 
equations requires complicated numerical solution.  
Because of the mathematical complexi ty and difficulty in determining some of the 
parameters employed in a full mechanistic model, simplified modeling approaches have been 
used by a number of investigators. The most commonly used simplification avoids the 
complexity of solving the partial dif ferential equation for intraparticle diffusion by using the 
approximation of a linear driving force model. Another common simplification involves the 
assumption of local equilibrium which eliminates the need to consider the kinetics of 
adsorption. Trujillo  et al.  (1991) used a simplified packed bed model that considers plug flow of 
the liquid phase and a linearized mass transfer rate expression to model the breakthrough 
curves for a multimetal solution obtained with a column packed with immobilized sphagnum  
peat moss. Hatzikioseyian et al.  (2000) applied a simplified packed bed model based on the 
concept of rapid local equilibrium to simulate experimental breakthrough curves selected from 
the biosorption literature. Mass transfer resistances in the liquid an d solid phases and other rate 
processes were lumped into an apparent overall dispersion coefficient. In general, the above 
approaches require a numerical solution in cases where the equilibrium isotherm is nonlinear.  
In this work we tested the capability of a relatively simple mathematical model to describe 
the experimental breakthrough profiles. The model with two adjustable parameters is given by 
(Belter et al. , 1988):

where erf[ x] is the error function  of x, t is the column residence time, ta is the time at which the 
effluent concentration is half the influent concentration, and  represents the standard deviation 
which is a measure of the slope of the breakthrough curve. Eq. (1) has been used to simula te the 
breakthrough  curves for  copper biosorption on polyvinyl formal -immobilized Rhizopus arrhizus

and native Mucor mi ehei (Brady et al. , 1999). The model parameters ta and  were estimated by 
fitting Eq. (1) to the experimental breakthrough data of Figure 1 using a nonlinear least -squares 
regression program based on a combination of Gauss -Newton and Levenberg -Marquardt 
methods. The fitted values of ta and  and the correlation coefficient r2 are listed in Table 1. 
Breakthrough curves calculated using these best fit values are shown as lines in Figure 1, in 
comparison with the experimental data. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the agreement 
between experimental curves and calculated ones was approximate. In particular, the model 
overestimated the sharpness of the leading and trailing edges of the experimental curves. In 
addition, the model predicted a nonzero effluent con centration at t = 0 which contradicts real 
conditions.

The discrepancy between measured and calculated curves can be ascribed to the 
approximations inherent in using simplistic packed bed models such as Eq. (1). Such models are 
in general capable of simulating only symmetric breakthrough curves. The experimental 
breakthrough curves of this study exhibited an asymmetric shape; a short leading edge 
followed by a very gradual approach to the feed concentration at the latter stage of the 
breakthrough. The broadness of the trailing edge was most likely due to slow intraparticle 
diffusion within the pores of the immobilized biomass beads. Figure 2 shows a scanning electron 
micrograph of the porous surface of a PVA -immobilized biomass bead. Copper ions must first 
diffuse into the porous bead before sequestration of the metal ion by se aweed biomass could 
take place. According to Cooney (1991), the ‘tailing’ of a breakthrough curve (i.e., a slow 
approach of Ce/Ci towards 1) is commonly observed in liquid phase adsorption where 
intraparticle diffusion is the rate -limiting transport proces s.

One way to improve the modeling capability of Eq. (1) is to omit the trailing edge of the 
breakthrough curve in the curve fitting process. Such a modeli ng approach could have practical 
benefits because it is often not necessary to model the entire breakthrough curve. In single 
column operations it is normal practice to terminate the influent flow at the breakthrough time 
at which the effluent concentratio n reaches a specified Ce/Ci value. This value is of course very 
small in order to meet regulatory standards for metal discharge. It is therefore of practical 
interest to simulate the initial stage of the breakthrough curve. Figure 3 shows the fitting of Eq . 
(1) to  the experimental  breakthrough  curves  using  data  at  Ce/Ci < 0.6. The best  fit  ta and  

values along with  the r2 values are listed in Table 2. It is obvious that the calculated 
breakthrough curves were in excellent agreement with the experimental profiles. Such close 
agreement suggests that the simplified two parameter model can still be a practical tool that  is 
accurate for the modeling of packed bed biosorption columns.

To be viable for practical applications, immobilized biomass should retain its metal uptake 
capability over multiple cycles of use. In this study the performance of PVA -immobilized 
seaweed biomass was assessed over two consecutive cycles of  copper loading and elution. 
Each cycle consisted of a loading step using a copper solution of 20mg/l and an elution step 
using an aqueous solution containing 4mM EDTA. The resulting breakthrough and elution 
profiles for each cycle are shown in Figures 4 a nd 5, respectively. Figure 4 shows that the two 
breakthrough curves are of similar shape, indicating that the metal uptake capacity of the 
immobilized biomass remained essentially unaltered over two adsorption -desorption cycles. 
Almost identical elution pr ofiles were obtained for the two cycles, as shown in Figure 5. The 
effluent copper concentration increased rapidly after a short period of time, reaching a 
maximum of about 270mg/l, followed by a rapid decline in the effluent copper concentration. 
The whol e elution process could be completed within 2.5h. The amounts of copper loaded and 
eluted in each cycle estimated from the respective breakthrough and elution curves indicate 
that almost complete recovery of the bound copper was readily achieved in each ca se.

4. CONCLUSIONS  
 
This work demonstrated that nonliving seaweed bioma ss immobilized in PVA gel beads 
could be used in a packed bed column for the removal and recovery of copper from aqueous 
solution. The continuous -flow column studies demonstrated the robustness of the immobilized 
biomass beads in repeated loading/elution c ycles. The biomass beads could be regenerated 
with an aqueous solution containing 4mM EDTA. It was established that the dynamic behavior 
of the biosorption column was not entirely predictable on the basis of a simplified two 
parameter packed bed model. Thi s was largely due to the fact that the two parameter model is 
only capable of simulating symmetric breakthrough curves. The breakthrough curves obtained 
in this study exhibited a very broad trailing edge due to slow intraparticle diffusion within the 
pores  of the PVA -immobilized biomass beads. A more detailed analysis using mechanistic 
models will be the subject of a future communication.
