drugs (lacosamide, levetiracetam, sodium valproate, phenytoin and phenobarbital) in
benzodiazepine resistant convulsive status epilepticus .Eight studies describing treatment
withintravenous sodium valproate in250benzodiazepine -resistant episodes were included in
themeta -analysis .The meta -analysis was performed onacombination ofdifferent study
designs, randomized withdifferent comparators (phenytoin inAgarwal 200717 ,phenobarbital
inMalamiri 201218 ),aswell asobservational studies .Three oftheeight studies were in
adults and Chen 2009 was inchildren and adults with status epilepticus resistant toIV
Diazepam andintramuscular phenobarbital .Themeta -analysis yielded amean effect size for
theefficacy ofsodium valproate of75.7%(95%CI:63.7–84.8%).Inthisreview, theefficacy of
phenytoin was 50.2%(95%CI:34.266.1%)and that ofphenobarbital was 73.6%(95%CI:
58.3–84.8%).

(adults and children) with status epilepticus which didnotrespond tofirst-line

andseizure recurrence within 24hours .There wasnodifference inefficacy interms
ofseizure cessation (44/50inthesodium valproate group versus 42/50inthe
phenytoin group) orseizure recurrence within 24hours inboth thegroups (no

two groups tostudy theefficacy ofsodium valproate (VPA) and phenytoin (PHT) .
Seizures were aborted in66%intheVPA group and 42%inthePHT group .Asa
second choice inrefractory patients, VPA waseffective in79%andPHT waseffective in
25%.The side effects inthetwo groups didnotdiffer .Sodium valproate may be
preferred inconvulsive SEbecause ofitshigher efficacy .

Amiri -Nikpour MR1,Nazarbaghi S1,Eftekhari P1,Mohammadi S2,Dindarian S2,Bagheri M2,Mohammadi H3.The administration ofsodium valproate andphenytoin respectively resulted
inseizure control in43(78.18%)and39(70.90%)ofthepatients within 7
days ofdrug administration (p=.428).Seven -daymortality ratewas similar
inboth groups (12.73%vs.12.73%;p=.612).There was nosignificant
difference inadverse effects between twogroups .
Sodium valproate ispreferred toIVPHT fortreatment andcontrol ofSEdue
toitshigher tolerability andlower hemodynamic instability .•This was arandomized double blind study comparing theefficacy and safety of
intravenous sodium valproate versus intravenous phenobarbital inchildren with
status epilepticus notresponding tointravenous diazepam .
•There wasnodifference inefficacy interms ofseizure cessation efficacy interms of
seizure cessation (27/30inthesodium valproate group versus 23/30inthe
phenobarbital group) .
•Seizure recurrence within 24hours was more inthephenobarbital (12/23)group as
compared tothesodium valproate group (4/27).
•Clinically significant adverse effects occurred in74%patients ofthephenobarbital
group and24%patients ofthevalproate group (p<0.001).

•Both phenobarbital and phenytoin areassociated with arange ofside-
effects such ascardiac arrhythmias,hypotension, and respiratory
depression (although thelatter may beexacerbated due totheprior
administration ofbenzodiazepines) .
•Phenytoin inaddition cancause serious skin reactions attheinjection
site.Itshould beadministered slowly through alarge vein, and cardiac
monitoring isrequired (which isfrequently notavailable inresource -poor
countries) .•Anopen -label, randomized controlled study was conducted atatertiary care teaching
hospital tocompare efficacy and safety ofintravenous sodium valproate versus
diazepam infusion forcontrol ofrefractory status epilepticus .Refractory status
epilepticus was controlled in80%ofthevalproate and85%ofthediazepam patients .
Themedian time tocontrol refractory status epilepticus was less inthevalproate group
(5minutes) than thediazepam group (17minutes ;P<.001).None ofthepatients inthe
valproate group required ventilation ordeveloped hypotension ,whereas inthe
diazepam group 60%required ventilation and50%developed hypotension after starting
diazepam infusion .Noadverse effects onliver functions were seen withvalproate .

Ason31stJanuary 2006 ,atotal of517medically confirmed adverse drug reactions in
224 patients receiving intravenous sodium valproate had been reported inthe
worldwide SanofiAventis post-marketing pharmacovigilance database since 1994 .24
Given theestimated exposure tointravenous sodium valproate over theperiod (1
million units prescribed peryear worldwide), thereporting rateforadverse events was
lessthan onecase per100,000administrations .ENVIDENCE OF SAFETYVALPROATE
The systematic review byTrinka etal22provides keyevidence astothesafety of
sodium valproate .Inthis study, evidence forthesafety ofintravenous sodium
valproate was obtained from dedicated safety studies, adverse event reporting inthe
efficacy studies, individual case reports, and pharmacovigilance reporting .The
incidence ofadverse events was low overall (<10%),mainly dizziness,
thrombocytopenia, and mild hypotension, which was independent ofinfusion rates ,
and agood cardiovascular and respiratory tolerability even inhigh doses and fast
infusion rates upto30mg/kg at10mg/kg/min .Themost frequent reported side effects
inuncontrolled studies and case series include nausea/vomiting, dizziness and
sedation .Noeffect onrespiratory function wasnoted .Mild hyperammonemia andmild
thrombocytopenia have been reported infewpatients .IN SUMMARY
•Sodium valproate IV is an option in the treatment of status epilepticus
resistant to initial treatment with benzodiazepines in children and 
adults as a second -line agent. The overall response rate (control of 
status epilepticus ) was 75.7 %. 
•Effective for all types of status epilepticus (Level B)
•DOSE: Loading dose: 20 -40 mg/kg IV 3 -5 mg/kg/m, max 3000mg
Maintenance dose: 30 –60mg/kg/d (orally/ IV) 
•Well tolerated as a rapid IV infusion 
•Free of respiratory depression and hypotension.THANK YOU
