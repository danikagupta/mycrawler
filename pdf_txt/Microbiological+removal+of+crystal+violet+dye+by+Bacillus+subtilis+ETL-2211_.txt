Abstract  
Background:  Synthetic dyes that are routinely used in various industries are becoming a threat to our 
environment  if emitted without treatment. Previous s tudies were performed to detect textile dye de gradation by 
isolates collected  from effluents of textile industries. Here , our study was designed to investigate  whether 
indigenous Bacillus  spp. collected from garden soil was able to degrade hazardous crystal violet (CV) dye.  
Materials and Methods : In this regard, we collected soil samples from a garden, diluted and pl ated on nutrient 
agar (N A) media. After incubation, the isolates were subjected to amylase activity to primarily screen Bacillus  
spp. T he isolat es with amylolytic activity  were exposed  to physiologic al, cultural and biochemical  examinations 
to presumptively identify Bacillus  spp. The latter was  screened on NA media containing CV dye and further 
evaluated for percent dye decolorization in liquid nu trient broth (NB) both time - and concentration -
dependently.  
Results : We have found  four isolates (A2, A4, B4, and C4) that were presumptively  identified as Bacillus  spp. 
All four Bacillus  isolates showed decolorization on solid media. Differential dye deg radation potential was 
observed by the isolates  in liquid culture . Among the four Bacillus  isolates, isolate A2 was found to posses s the 
highest decolorization potential of CV dye. Our data showed that isolate A2 can degrade 98.56%, 94.04% and 
75.63% CV dy e at 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL  concentrations following 9 d ays of incubation. After  isolate A2, 
isolates A4 and B4  showed great potential where isolate C4 showed the lowest competence in decolorizing CV 
dye.  
Conclusion: Therefore, indigenous garden soil Bacillus  spp. can be utilized in bioremediation of highly toxic 
textile dyes following detailed studies.

I. Introduction  
As with the growing population, the revolution i n industries is taking part to meet all the basic needs 
that have a direct influence on our environment1. Proper  management of discharged waste water coming from 
various industries is a major concern worldwide although the scenario is even worse  for a count ry like, 
Bangladesh. The country with a 7.3% gross domestic product (GDP) annual growth becomes  the world’s 
seventh -highest growing economy. The readymade garments (RMG) sector took the biggest part among  all the 
industries taking part in  that GDP2. Garmen ts and textile industries consume the highest amount of water that is  
when discharged to the nature comprising of deleterious chemicals as coloring dyes, sizing agents and many 
other recalcitrant chemicals3. It was estimated that around 100,000 commercial dyes are present and roughly 1 
million tons of dyes are produced per year but the concern is aroun d 10% dye of the total usage is disposed o f as 
waste ( £). Disposal of dyes have crucial consequence in the environment even at very low concentration as they 
have effect on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD), aesthetic deterioration, 
an obstacle in penetrating oxygen and sunlight to water bodies and they or their metabolites might have toxic, 
carcinogenic and mutagenic effect to flo ra and fauna3, 4, 5. Although some physical, and chemical treatments and 
their strategies are available but the situation is worst in developing countries due to partially or completely 
ignoring the treatment procedure before discharge6. Moreover, that  treatment procedures are not very effective 
in terms of cost, activity, and environmental safety as a secondary level of environmental pollution occurs due to 
huge amounts of sludge are generated  that is difficult to dispose o f7. Therefore, biological agents are gaining 
more importance in bioremediation purpose owing to their economical scheme and potential to produce less 
sludge that reduces pollution risk8. From last few years, Bacillus  species are gaining more awareness as they 
have huge potential in degrad ing and mineralizing various complex chemicals including environmentally unsafe 
synthetic commercial dyes9, 10, 11.

detergent , etc ( Wikipedia ). The dye is considered  a biohazard substance because of its carcinogenic and 
mutagenic effects along with its recalcitrant property12. To reduce the havo c to the environment, we made an 
effort to detect whether Bacillus  spp. isolated from garden soil can decolorize and biodegrade CV dye.   
 
II. Materials a nd M ethod s 
Sample collection and processing:  
Soil samples were collected in a sterile beaker using a  sterile spatula at a depth of 2 -3 cm from a garden 
soil of Stamford University Bangladesh, Shiddeswari campus, Dhaka, Bangladesh. One gram of soil  sample was 
dispensed into 99 mL  of sterile distilled water and homogenized. One ml of homogenized soil sampl e was 
transferred into 9 mL  sterile normal saline  and a serial dilution was carried out up  to 10-6 dilution . 
 
Screening of amylase producing bacteria:  
Serially di luted bacterial cultures (100 µL ) were spread  on nutrient agar media and incubated at 37 C 
for 24 h. Their colony morphology was noted and subsequently, isolated colonies were streaked on starch agar 
media containing starch as the only carbon  source for starch hydrolysis test to detect their amylolytic activity. 
The plates were incubated at 37 C for  24-48 h. Following incubation, plates were flooded with Gram’s iodine 
(Gram’s iodine -250 mg iodine crystals added to 2.5 g potassium iodide solutio n, and 125 mL  of water, kept at 
room temperature) to identify the zone of clearance around the colony. Deep blue color around the growth 
indicates a negative result that is no amylolytic activity where the zone of clearance produced by amylase 
producers. The pure cultures showing clear zones were subcultured at regular interval s and maintained on to 
nutrient aga r slants at 4 C. 
 
Identification of Bacillus  spp.:   
Isolated amylase producing bacteria were presumptively identified as Bacillus  spp. by morphological , 
cultural and biochemical characteristics. The biochemi cal tests included methyl red, Voges -Proskauer, ci trate 
utilization, indole production, H 2S production, motility, gelatine hy drolysis, sugar hy drolysis, oxidase, and 
catalase.   
 
Screening for dye decolorization:   
CV dye was collected  from a textile industry located in Savar. Stock concentration was prepar ed using 
distilled water in a vial and kept at 4 C until used. The isolates were cultured on CV dye containing NA media 
at a concentration of 0.025 mg/mL  concentration  for 24 -72 h. The culture plates were checked every day for any 
decolorization of media s urrounding the colony.         
 
Dye decolorization assay : 
Decolorization experiment of CV dye was performed by using CV dye in a 100 mL conical flask 
containing 50 mL of nutrient broth. A 50 µL  of 24 h old Bacillus  culture corresponding to Mcfarland standard  
0.5 was used as inocula to inoculate the 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL  CV dye supplemented broth. The inoculated 
conical flasks were incubated at room temperature for 3, 4, 7 and 9 days to detect  dye decolorization . Following 
incubation, decolorization of dye s by selected isolates was  observed at each time period  and only 5 mL  cultures  
were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatants were subjected to UV -spectrometry at 620 nm 
and the absorbance was recorded. The unino culated media with CV dye  was served as respective blank for the 
dye decolorization assay. The percentage of dye decolorization was calculated as stated before (Alalewi and 
Jiang, 2012).

III. Results  
Isolation and characteri zation of Bacillus  spp.:  
Among a good number of bacterial isolates, only 4 bacterial isolates namely 2A, 4A, 4B and 4C were 
presumptively found to belong to the genus Bacillus  spp. following characterization by morphological (Table 1), 
cultural (Table 2) a nd biochemical examinations  (Table 3). Figure 1 showed the microscopic images of the  
presumptively identified Bacillus  isolates.

Screening of CV dye decolorization by Bacillus  spp.:  
 
Following inoculation of the Bacillus  isolates  onto CV containing nutrient agar plates showed a 
clearing appearance of the CV dye surrounding the cultures. The c learance of CV dye was observed with all the 
four isolates  in both NA and NB media . Representative pictures of CV dye decolorization by isola te 4B on NA 
media following 24 h of incubation and on NB media by 2A,  4A, 4B and 4C isolat es at 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 
mg/mL  concentrations after 4 days of incubation were presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively . 
Moreover, the dye decolorization pote ntial of CV dye following incubation at 3, 4, 7 and 9 days with the isolates 
2A, 4A, 4B and 4C we re summarized by bar graphs in Figure  4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively.  Among the four 
Bacillus  isolates, isolate 2A was found to posses s the highest decolorization  potential of CV dye. Our data 
showed that isolate 2A can degrade 98.56%, 94.04% and 75.63% CV dye at 0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL 
concentrations following 9 days of incubation. After  isolate 2A, isolates 4A and 4B also showed great potential 
where isolate 4C  showed the lowest competence in decolorizing CV dye. However, the highest decolorization 
was observed after 3 days of incubation at 0.025 and 0.1 mg/mL concentration by isolate 2A, but at 0.05 mg/mL 
concentration by isolate 4B. A time - and concentration -dependent increase of dye decolorization was observed 
in all the cases. Furthermore, a gradual increase of dye decolorization was detected in most of the cases but a 
sharp increase o f decolorization was observed after  7 and 9 days of incubatio n by isolate 4 C with 0.025 mg/mL  
concentrations.  Tests  Media  Observation

IV. Discussion  
A huge amount of disposal of environmentally unfr iendly hazardous and recalcitrant pollutants from 
various industries is creating an immense threat to the environment as well as to the plants, animals and 
ultimat ely, humans. Due to the cost -effectiveness and environmentally caring approaches, microbial p rocesses 
are the choi ces in reducing the havoc to  mankind. As Bacillus  spp. is a remarkable bacterium with high pote ntial Microbiological Decolorization of Crystal Violet Dye by Indigenous Bacillus  spp. Isolated from .. 
DOI: 10.9790/2402 -140201 2934                                      www.iosrjournals.org                                         34 | Page  to produce diverse  metabolites of different usage, we become interested whether they can potentially degrade 
CV dye at different conce ntrations and time periods. Few previous studies reported that Bacillus  species 
collected fro m textile industry effluents is  capable to degrade CV dye that are used in those industries14, 15. 
However, we were interested to distinguish whether indigenous Bacillus  spp. isolated from garden soil can 
degrade the highly toxic CV dye. Among the four Bacillus  isolates, isolate 2A was found to posses s the highest 
decolorization potential of CV dye. A previous report showed that CV dye decolorization was 81.25% by 
Enterobacter  spp. where our Bacillus  isolates, 2A, 4A, 4B and 4C showed 81.48%, 79.39%, 76.49% and 
22.23% following 72 h of incubation , respectively16. In another study, the highest decolorization (95%) was 
observed at 35 C, whereas the decolorization reach ed 85% at 37 C by the isolate Bacillus subtilis  ETL-2211 
after 24 h of incubation15. Very prominent dye decoloriz ation was observed in another  study where at 35 C 
Bacillus subtilis  was able to degrade 100 mg/mL CV dye effectively (90%)15. In our case, we o bserved very 
significant  dye decolorization after 72 h of incubation. But, the rate of dye decolorization might be improved by 
optimizing the conditions such as pH, temperatu re, inoculum concentrations,  and carbon  and nitrogen source s as 
well and their  concentrations.  
 
V. Conclusion  
Day by day, the increasing growth of industries is creating high risk to the environment as the toxic and 
hazardous chemicals coming from the effluents.  Therefore, microbial approaches  are well suited to add ress this 
issue. In t his regard , our study may enlighten to degrade highly toxic CV dye by using indigenous garden 
Bacillus  isolates. We are taking  consideration to thoroughly investigate to augment the capacity of those 
indigenous isolates in dye degradation by optimizing var ious parameters as well as improve their dye 
degradation  by slowly acclimatize them in increasing dye concentrations.
