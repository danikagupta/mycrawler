The morphology of strains of Skeletonema Grev-
ille emend Sarno et Zingone was examined in LM,
TEM, and SEM and compared with sequence datafrom nuclear small subunit rDNA and partial large
subunit rDNA. Eight distinct entities were identi-
ﬁed, of which four were known: S. menzelii Guillard,
Carpenter et Reimann; S. pseudocostatum Medlin
emend. Zingone et Sarno; S. subsalsum (Cleve) Bet-
hge; and S. tropicum Cleve. The other four species
were new: S. dohrnii Sarno et Kooistra sp. nov., S.
grethae Zingone et Sarno sp. nov., S. japonicum Zin-
gone et Sarno sp. nov., and S. marinoi Sarno et Zin-
gone sp. nov. Skeletonema species fell into four
morphologically distinct groups corresponding to
four lineages in the small subunit and large subunit
trees. Lineage I included S. pseudocostatum ,S. trop-
icum,S. grethae , and S. japonicum . All have external
processes of the fultoportulae with narrow tips that
connect with those of sibling cells via fork-, knot-, orknuckle- like junctions. Lineage II included onlythe solitary species S. menzelii . Lineage III com-
prised S. dohrnii and S. marinoi . This latter pair
have ﬂattened and ﬂared extremities of the process-es of the fultoportulae, which interdigitate with
those of contiguous valves without forming knots
or knuckles. Lineage IVonly contained the brackishwater species S. subsalsum . Some species also differ
in their distribution and seasonal occurrence. These
ﬁndings challenge the concept of S. costatum as a
single cosmopolitan and opportunistic species and
calls for reinterpretation of the vast body of re-
search data based on this species.

In 1973 Hasle wrote ‘‘To most marine planktolo-
gists, the name Skeletonema is synonymous with the
specific name Skeletonema costatum .’’ This species fea-
tures in numerous research studies across all biological
disciplines, and of 588 papers published since 1990that mention Skeletonema in their title or abstract, 548
refer specifically to S. costatum (Greville) Cleve. The
picture that emerges from this body of literature is ofan easily culturable widely tolerant species that thrives
in nutrient-rich coastal waters throughout the world.
In addition, results of these different studies are inter-preted and compared, with the implicit assumption
that all strains and populations are part of a single
species.
Skeletonema costatum is easily identiﬁed by its cylin-
drical cells with a ring of long processes emerging from
the edge of the valve face (originally called costae by
Greville [1866]). These processes are aligned parallelto the longitudinal axis of the cell and connect with
similar processes of adjacent sibling valves, thus form-
ing chains. The species was described originally as Me-
losira costata Greville (Greville 1866) and subsequently
transferred to Skeletonema (Cleve 1873) because of the
similarity of the ‘‘longitudinal costae’’ (processes) tothose observed in the type species of that time, the

DOI: 10.1111/j.1529-8817.2005.04067.xfossil Skeletonema barbadensis Greville. More recently,
Sims (1994) demonstrated that several fossil Skeleton-
emaspecies, including S. barbadensis , differ markedly
from the extant ones. Therefore, she established a newgenus, Skeletonemopsis , for these fossils, conserving the
genus Skeletonema for the extant ones and with S. cos-
tatum as the type species (Ross et al. 1996).
After the transfer of M. costata toSkeletonema (Cleve
1873), ﬁve more species were described in the genus
based on morphological characters: S.tropicum ,S. sub-
salsum ,S. potamos (Weber) Hasle, S. cylindraceum Prosh-
kina-Lavrenko et Makarova, and S. menzelii . A detailed
morphological investigation using EM documentedconsiderable variation in S. costatum and other conge-
neric species (Hasle 1973). Gallagher and coworkers
(Gallagher 1980, 1982, Gallagher et al. 1984) demon-strated high diversity in allozyme patterns amongstrains of S. costatum and suggested that several species
might be hidden within this taxon. Medlin et al. (1991)
were the ﬁrst to recognize a new species, S. pseudo-
costatum Medlin, based on morphological and molecu-
lar information. However, their concept of S. costatum
does not agree with the type and a new species must bedescribed for it (see below).
In many areas, species attributed to S. costatum (sensu
lato) are among the most important contributors to
phytoplankton blooms (Karentz and Smayda 1984,Cloern et al. 1985, Estrada et al. 1985). In the Gulf
of Naples, the species blooms in late spring (Ribera
d’Alcala `et al. 2004), whereas in the nearby Adriatic
Sea it is a recurrent winter blooming species (Zoppini
et al. 1995, Totti et al. 2002, Bernardi Aubry et al.
2004). Preliminary observations revealed morpholog-ical differences between specimens obtained from
these two regions, none of which completely matched
any described species. These results prompted moredetailed morphological and molecular analyses of sev-
eral Skeletonema strains obtained from various places.
Results of these investigations revealed previously un-suspected morphological and genetic diversity withinthe genus. To assess which strains belonged to S. cos-
tatum , a reexamination of the type material of this spe-
cies was needed. The results of this study are reportedin a companion article along with the description of a
second species found in the type material, S. grevillei
Sarno et Zingone (Zingone et al. 2005). None of thestrains we examined here corresponds to the type ma-
terial. Thus, here we describe four new Skeletonema
species based on morphological characteristics ob-tained from SEM and TEM observations and differ-ences in the nuclear-encoded small subunit (SSU)
rDNA and the hypervariable region of the nuclear-en-
coded large subunit (LSU) rDNA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of strains and culture conditions. Seawater samples
were collected with Niskin bottles or plankton nets in theGulf of Naples (station MC, 40 149
0N, 14 1150E) and in the
Adriatic Sea on various dates (Table 1). Clonal cultures ofSkeletonema were established from these samples by micropi-pette isolation. Additional strains were obtained from the
Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP , Oban, UK),The Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Cultures of Ma-rine Phytoplankton (CCMP , Bigelow, ME, USA), or kindlyprovided by colleagues mentioned in the acknowledgments.All cultures (Table 1) were maintained at the Stazione Zoo-logica ‘‘Anton Dohrn,’’ Naples (SZN). Skeletonema subsalsum
was grown in a medium prepared with 14% f/2 (Guillard1975), 22% soil extract (1 kg garden soil boiled with 1000 mLdistilled water to give 500 mL extract), and 64% bidistilledwater, with a ﬁnal salinity of 5 psu. All other strains weremaintained in f/2 medium, adjusted to a salinity of 36 psu.Cultures were kept in glass tubes at 20–22 1C and a 12:12-h
light:dark cycle at 100 mmol photons /C1m
/C02/C1s/C01emitted from
cool white ﬂuorescent tubes.
Preserved material. Several natural samples from the Gulf
of Naples (T yrrhenian Sea) and the Adriatic Sea were exam-ined to establish the morphological features of Skeletonema
species. T yrrhenian samples were mostly collected at stationMC (see above). Adriatic samples were collected in the north-ern part, offshore from Venice, in winter and spring 2000–2002. A few samples collected in winter 2001 offshore of An-cona, mid-Adriatic Sea, were also examined.
LM. Light microscope observations were made on expo-
nentially growing cultures or natural samples with an Axiop-hot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany)equipped with Nomarski differential interference contrast,phase contrast, and bright-ﬁeld optics. Light micrographswere taken using a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera. To removeorganic matter, samples from cultures or ﬁeld material weretreated with acids (1:1:4, sample:HNO
3:H2SO 4), boiled for
few seconds, and then washed with distilled water. Perma-
nent slides were prepared by mounting the dry clean mate-
rial in Hyrax (Hasle 1978).
EM. Acid-cleaned material was mounted on stubs, sputter
coated with gold-palladium, and observed using a Philips 505scanning electron microscope (Philips Electron Optics BV ,Eindhoven, Netherlands) or mounted onto Formvar-coatedgrids and observed using a Philips 400 transmission electronmicroscope. Fixed samples not subjected to cleaning weredehydrated in an ethanol series, critical point dried substi-tuting 100% ethanol with CO
2, sputter coated with gold-pal-
ladium, and observed with SEM. The terminology used to
describe ultrastructural features of Skeletonema species follows
Anonymous (1975) and Ross et al. (1979).
DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analy-
ses.For molecular analysis, cultures of Skeletonema species
were harvested during the exponential growth phase by cen-trifugation or ﬁltration on 0.45- mm pore-size polycarbonate ﬁl-
ters. The DNA extraction and puriﬁcation, PCR ampliﬁcation,sequencing, and alignment of the nuclear-encoded SSU rDNAwere carried out as described in Kooistra et al. (2003) or inMedlin et al. (2000). The PCR ampliﬁcation, sequencing, and
alignment of the nuclear-encoded LSU rDNA were performed
as described in Orsini et al. (2002). Strains used in the molec-ular analysis are listed in Table 1 together with the GenBankaccession numbers of their SSU region and of the ﬁrst approx-imately 800 bp of the LSU. The LSU and SSU alignmentsare available in the EMBL-Align database as ALIGN_000787and ALIGN_000788, respectively. See http://www.3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/webin/help/webinalign/align_SRS_help.html
Modeltest version 3.06 (Posada and Crandall 2001) was
used to select optimal base substitution models and values forbase composition,% invariable sites, and gamma shape param-
eter according to hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRTs) and
Akaike information criterion (AIC). Maximum likelihood (ML)analyses of the alignment were performed under the full heu-ristic search option in PAUP *version 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002)
and were constrained with values obtained by Modeltest.DIANA SARNO ET AL. 152Identical sequences were removed before data analysis to
minimize calculation time. Bootstrap values (1000 replicates)
were calculated using the same ML model, but in case a cladecontained only identical sequences, two were retained insteadof one to permit calculation of the support for that clade. Max-imum parsimony (MP) analyses were carried out using fullheuristic searches also using PAUP *. The SSU data set con-tained 36 sequences and 1824 positions; the LSU data set con-
tained 37 sequences and 796 positions.

Four were attributable to already described species,
viz., S. menzelii ,S. pseudocostatum ,S. subsalsum ,a n d
S. tropicum . An emended description was warranted
forS. pseudocostatum , and additional morphological fea-
tures were observed in the other three species. The
other four morphs constitute new species. T wo ofthese, S. dohrnii and S. marinoi , were isolated from
the Mediterranean Sea, whereas S. japonicum was iden-
tiﬁed in a strain from the Seto Inland Sea (Japan). Thefourth new species, S. grethae , was established for ma-
terial identiﬁed as S. costatum in a previous article
(Medlin et al. 1991). Morphometric and morpholog-ical characteristics of all the species examined are
summarized in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
Skeletonema Greville emend. Sarno et Zingone (Fig.
1, A–N)
Cells cylindrical in shape, colonial or solitary. Each
cell contains one, two, or many chloroplasts. Valve di-
ameter 2–38 mm. Valves ﬂattened or slightly convex,
valve mantle almost perpendicular. Costae emerging
from a circular annulus, delimiting radial rows of po-
roid or pseudoloculate areolae, 26–58 in 10 mm. Fulto-
portulae (FPs) located in a marginal ring, with two or
three satellite pores. External processes of the FPs
generally long and tubular, open or closed along theirlength. The processes are oriented perpendicularly tothe valve face, and their ends join with those of the
processes of contiguous valves, each connecting to one
or two opposite processes. Each valve possesses a singlerimoportula (RP), located marginally in intercalary
valves and subcentrally or marginally in terminal
valves. The tubular process of the RP is long in termi-nal valves, whereas it can be short or long in intercalary
valves. Cingulum formed of a valvocopula and several
open bands with ligula and antiligula. Each copula hasa central longitudinal ridge on either side of which are
transverse ribs (11–16 in 1 mm) interspaced by uniseri-
ate rows of pores or by smooth hyaline areas.
Description: The general morphological features of
Skeletonema s p e c i e se x a m i n e di nt h i si n v e s t i g a t i o n
(Fig. 1) generally coincide with those illustrated in
previous descriptions of the genus (Castellvı ´1971,
Hasle 1973, Round 1973, Housley et al. 1975, Fryxell
1976, Smith 1981, Round et al. 1990). With the ex-
ception of S. menzelii , all form colonies of variable
length, generally straight, sometimes curved or
coiled (Fig. 1A). The cells are cylindrical, with a
more or less convex valve surface, and the mantle isslightly oblique or perpendicular to the valve face( F i g .1 ,C ,E ,G ,a n dI ) .I no u rm a t e r i a l ,c e l ld i a m e t e r
ranges between 2 and 17.5 mm, more often 4–8 mm.
Specimens of larger size ( o38mmd i a m e t e r )a r er e -
ported in the literature (Cleve 1900, Hasle 1973); the
pervalvar axis length is variable depending on the
extension of the cingulum.
Each cell generally contains one to two parietal
chloroplasts except for S. cylindraceum ,S. japonicum ,
and S. tropicum , which may have several chloroplasts.
In most species, radial and tangential costae run acrossthe valve in a network, delimiting radial rows of are-
olae (Fig. 1B). The areolae are quadrangular or irreg-
ularly circular, but those located at the branchingpoints of the network may be triangular. The radialcostae originate from a central annulus (Fig. 1B),
which may contain a variable number of irregular are-
olae. The costae are generally thicker toward the valvemargin and on the mantle, where the areolae become
pseudoloculate. The areolae are occluded by an inter-
nal cribrum perforated by minute pores. Transversecostae and areolae are missing in S. menzelii thus this
species has only a basal siliceous layer.
The FPs, or strutted processes, are located in a mar-
ginal ring at the transition between the valve face and
the mantle (Fig. 1, B–J). Three satellite pores lie at the
base of each FP in all species (Fig. 1B), with the ex-ception of S. menzelii , which has two satellite pores. In
some cases, thin organic ﬁbers are seen to emerge from
the FPs in culture material (Castellvı ´1971, Yamada
and Takano 1987). Each FP is associated with a longexternal process (fultoportula process, FPP) oriented
parallel to the pervalvar axis and aligned perfectly with
the surfaces of the cingulum and mantle (Fig. 1, A andC–J). The FPPs are generally semicircular in cross-sec-
tion with an external split along their length. The mar-
gins of the split may coalesce partially ( S. tropicum )o r
along the whole length ( S. costatum ,S. subsalsum ), leav-
ing a proximal opening or a pore, respectively, and
often showing a suture along the fusion line. In other
cases ( S. pseudocostatum ,S. japonicum ) the base of the
FPP is tubular in terminal cells of the colonies. The
processes are variable in length within species depend-
ing on culture conditions, smallest in S. subsalsum ,
where they can also completely occlude the peripher-
al space between sibling valves.
Process shape differs among the species and also be-
tween intercalary and terminal valves of the colony in
individual species. In the following, ‘‘terminal fultopor-
tula (TFP)’’ and ‘‘intercalary FP’’ are used to designatethe FPs of terminal and intercalary valves of the colo-nies, respectively, whereas ‘‘terminal fultoportula proc-
ess (TFPP)’’ and ‘‘intercalary fultoportula process
(IFPP)’’ are used to designate the external projectionsof the FPs of the terminal (Fig. 1, C–F) and intercalary
valves (Fig. 1, G–J) of the colonies, respectively. TFPPs
generally have either ﬂared or narrow tips (Fig. 1, Cand E), which can be distinguished in LM (Fig. 1, D and
F). The TFPP tips can be truncated, jagged, or have
spines, ﬁnger-, or claw-shaped projections. In somecases, IFPPs of sibling valves are aligned, each joining asingle IFPP of the next cell (1:1 junction), with a visible
thickening at the junction (Fig. 1, G and H). In other
cases the IFPPs are displaced, one IFPP joining two IF-PPs of the next cell (1:2 junction). When the displace-
ment and the 1:2 junction are encountered along the
whole ring of IFPPs (Fig. 1I), a transverse zigzag (serrat-ed teeth) line may be seen in LM (Hasle 1973) (Fig. 1J).
Sibling valves do not separate upon acid cleaning.
Each valve bears a single RP or labiate process (Fig.
1, B, C, E, and G) with an external tubular process, theDIANA SARNO ET AL. 154FIG. 1. General morphology of the genus Skeletonema . LM: D, F , H, and J; SEM: A, E, G, I, and K; TEM: B, C, and L–N. (A)

ternal view, the RP appears as a slit with two lips ori-
ented radially or obliquely (Fig. 1K). The RP ofterminal valves (TRP) is generally located subcentral-ly, sometimes close to the annulus (Fig. 1B) or up to
halfway between the center and the valve margin (Fig.
1K). Skeletonema costatum (sensu stricto )a n d S. grevillei
Sarno et Zingone have a marginal TRP (Zingone et al.
2005). The long external process of the terminal rim-
oportula (TRPP) widens more or less abruptly towardits distal end (Fig. 1, C and E). In intercalary valves, the
RP (intercalary rimoportula, IRP) is located peripher-
ally, near the ring of strutted processes, and bears ashort external process (process of the intercalary rim-
oportula, IRPP) (Fig. 1G), with the exception of S. sub-
salsum andS. costatum , where the IRPP is long. In most
cases, size and location of the RP allow terminal valvesto be distinguished from intercalary valves in broken
colonies or loose valves. In addition, the presence of
long subcentral RPPs marks the point at which a col-ony will split into two.
The girdle (Fig. 1L) consists of a variable number of
open bands. The ﬁrst band (valvocopula) (Fig. 1M) isnarrow and more siliciﬁed than the others (copulae).
Each copula has a ligula and a small antiligula (Fig.
1N). A siliceous ridge runs along the whole length ofthe copula and is generally located in a median posi-tion, but it is displaced toward one margin in the cop-
ulae closer to the valvocopula. The longitudinal ridge
is ﬂanked on both sides by transverse ribs, sometimesbranching toward their ends. The ribs are interspaced
by either rows of pores (0.02–0.04 mm) or by smooth
hyaline areas with very ﬁne perforations (approxi-mately 2 nm).
Markedly different size classes were observed in
many species ( S. dohrnii ,S. grethae ,S. marinoi ,S. men-
zelii,S. pseudocostatum , and S. tropicum ), particularly in
recently established cultures, along with cell enlarge-
ment within a single colony. Gametes were never ob-served, and the larger size classes were probably aresult of vegetative enlargement (Gallagher 1983).

T ype locality: Gulf of Naples, Italy (South T yrrhe-
nian Sea, Mediterranean Sea).
Etymology: The species epithet is derived from An-
ton Dohrn (1840–1909), evolutionist and fervent
supporter of Darwinism, who founded the SZN.
Description: Cells 4–12 mm in diameter, forming
long colonies (Fig. 2A), often curved or coiled. The
valve face is slightly convex, with a prominent net-
work of costae delimiting rec tangular areolae, which
become pseudoloculate toward the mantle (Fig. 2, B
and F). The TFPPs and IFPPs are split and have ﬂat

be either aligned, with a 1:1 linkage (Fig. 2D), or dis-
placed, with a 1:2 linkage (Fig. 2E). The 1:2 linkagemay extend along the whole junction, which appearsas a zigzag line (Figs. 1J and 2G). The IFPPs interlock
is a plain joint, with no intricate knots or knuckles.

v a l v ef a c ei ss l i g h t l yc o n v e x .T h eT F P P sa r eo p e na n dshow narrow distal ends that can either be truncated
with an irregular margin (Fig. 3C) or have a ﬁnger-or
claw-like protrusion (Fig. 3D). The IFPPs are alsonarrow and are generally aligned and joined in a 1:1
fashion with those of the contiguous valves. Occa-
sionally, one IFPP joins two IFPPs of the sibling valve(1:2 junction) (Fig. 3, E–G), but a transverse zigzagline along the junction has never been observed. The
interlocking between IFPPs of sibling valves is some-
times a fork joint (Fig. 3F) but can be particularly in-
tricate and tight, like a knot or a knuckle (Fig. 3, Eand G). The TRP is subcentral and has a long process
with a slightly ﬂared apical opening (Fig. 3, B–D).
The IRP is marginal and has a short process (Fig. 3, Eand F). In the copulae, the transverse ribs are inter-
spaced by hyaline areas (Fig. 3, H and I).

Description: Cells 2–10 mm in diameter, forming
long colonies. Each cell has one to two, rarely three
to four, chloroplasts (Fig. 4A). The valve face is slight-
ly convex, with a conspicuous network of costae de-limiting radial rows of areol ae of irregular shape (Fig.
4B). In some specimens, spines or ridges are scat-
tered on the surface or a thick siliceous layer coversthe valve, partially or completely occluding the are-
olae (Fig. 4, C and D). The basal part of the TFPPs is
tubular and oblique to the cell axis, forming an anglewith the rest of the process, which is open along its
length and parallel to the cell axis (Fig. 4, C and D).
The distal end of the TFPPs is narrow and generallytruncated, with a slightly jagged rarely claw-like mar-gin (Fig. 4, C and D). The IFPPs are open and are
connected in a 1:1 or 1:2 mode. In the 1:1 junction
type, the adjoining IFPPs are slightly displaced, andtheir narrow distal ends interdigitate in a fork joint
(Fig. 4, E and F). In the 1:2 junction type, the IFPPs
are displaced and ﬂared at their distal ends, each tipforming knot-like junctions with the ﬂared ends of
two opposite IFPPs (Figs. 1I and 4, G–I). The TRP
has long and tubular process emerging close to thevalve center (Fig. 4, B–D). The IRP has a short ex-ternal tube and is located near the valve margin (Fig.
4G). In the copulae, the transverse ribs are inter-
spaced by rows of pores (Fig. 4J).

with a dentate margin (Fig. 5, C ands D). The IFPPs
of sibling valves can either be aligned, with a 1:1linkage (Fig. 5E), or displaced, with a 1:2 linkage and
a zigzag connection line (Fig. 5, F and G). The inter-
locking between IFPPs is in a ll cases a plain joint, with
no intricate knots or knuckles. The ﬂared tips of theIFPPs overlap with edges that interdigitate with one
another (Fig. 5, E–G). The TRP is located close to the
central annulus or midway between the center andthe margin of the valve and has a long tubular proc-
ess with a slightly ﬂared or trumpet-or cup-shaped

Material examined: Strains SZN-B82 and SZN-B83.
Description: Cells 2–7 mm in diameter (up to 10 mm
in natural samples), lenticular to cylindrical, depend-ing on cingulum development, solitary or in pairsDIANA SARNO ET AL. 160(Fig. 6A). Colonies are not observed. The frustule is
weakly siliciﬁed. The valves are markedly convexwith an inconspicuous mantle consisting of a lowhyaline border (Fig. 6, B, C, and E). Delicate ribs,
branching dichotomously, run radially on the valve
face starting from an irregularly structured centralarea (Fig. 6, B and E). Because of the absence of tan-
gential ribs, no areolae are formed. Barely visible
perforations are scattered on the valve (Fig. 6C). Ribshave at times small external spines (Fig. 6, D and E).
The FPs have open, narrow, and relatively long proc-
esses (Fig. 6, D and E, and Table 2), with two satellitepores in their basal part (Fig. 6C) and two or threemarginal spines toward their distal end (Fig. 6, D and
E). The RP is situated on the border of the centralarea; it has a long tubular process gradually expand-ing distally (Fig. 6, B and E). Neither marginal RPs
nor stable connections between FPPs of contiguous
valves have been observed. Both these characters aretypical of intercalary val ves in other species; there-
fore, their absence in S. menzelii suggests that cell
pairs are dividing cells. The copulae are character-ized by a weakly siliciﬁed median ridge and thin
transverse ribs at times branching at their ends

Description: Cells 2–9 mm in diameter, solitary or
forming relatively short chains (maximum, 34 cells)
in culture and in natural samples (Fig. 7A). Slightlyconvex valves. Rectangular to triangular areolae be-
come pseudoloculate near the mantle (Figs. 1B and 7,

allel to the pervalvar axis of the cell. The TFPPs have a
narrow tip which can be truncated, spiny, or claw-like(Fig. 7, C and D). The IFPPs are narrow, completely
open, and connect to those of adjacent cells by a fork
joint or by a knot-or knuckle-like connection (Fig. 7,E–H). The connection is most often of the 1:1 type, but
occasionally one IFPP is connected with two opposite
IFPPs (Fig. 7G). The TRP is subcentral and has a longprocess (Fig. 7, B and C). The IRP is marginal and has

Notes: This species is often found in its solitary form
as the most abundant Skeletonema in the Gulf of Naples,
where it attains maximum concentrations in May andJune (up to 8.6 /C210

Terminal valves were rarely observed in the colonies
of the cultured strain, and they were not clearlyillustrated in previous studies. The TFPPs appear aspartially closed tubes with an external hole at their
base and hook-shaped distal ends (Fig. 8, B and C).
The IFPPs vary greatly in length and shape, rangingfrom very short and apparently closed tubes to long-
er, open, or partially closed tubes (Fig. 8, D–G).
Closed IFPPs usually have an external hole at theirbase and a longitudinal suture distal to the hole
(Fig. 8, D–G). The distal end of the IFPPs is irregu-
larly expanded, with an undulate margin interlock-ing tightly with that of the sibling IFPPs (Fig. 8, D–G)
in a 1:1 or 1:2 fashion (Fig. 8, E and F). The TRP has
a long process and is located near the center of thevalve (Figs. 1K and 8, B and C). The IRP is located atthe rim of the valve face and bears a variably long
process with a tea-pot spout-like distal end (Fig. 8G).
Sometimes the IRPP is longer than the IFPPs andreaches the valve mantle of the proximate cell. In
other cases it is as long as the IFPPs, when it replaces
an IFPP and connects to one or to two opposite IFPPs(Fig. 8F). In the copulae, the transverse ribs are
interspaced by rows of pores (Fig. 8H).
Material examined: Strain CCAP 1077/8.
Notes: The only strain examined originates from
Lough Erne (Ireland), but the species was originally
described from the Stockholm Archipelago (Sweden).
Skeletonema tropicum Cleve (Fig. 9, A–H)
Strongly siliciﬁed cells, joined in colonies, generally
containing 5–10 chloroplasts (Fig. 9A). Smaller cells
may have fewer chloroplasts (at least one to two),whereas 30 chloroplasts were seen in a large specimen
in a natural sample from the Gulf of Naples. In cultured
specimens, cell diameter ranged between 5.3 and10mm, but cells of up to 17.5 mm in diameter were ob-
served in natural samples from the Gulf of Naples. The
valves are convex with a vertical mantle. On the valvesurface, well-developed costae delimit round or ovalareolae (Fig. 9B). Pseudoloculi are better developed
than in other species. FPPs are open (Fig. 9, C–F), but at
times the edges of the longitudinal splits in IFPPs sticktogether, leaving an elongated opening at the base of
the tube (Fig. 9E). The tips of the TFPPs are truncated
(Fig. 9D) or, more often, show a stout spine or a claw-like projection (Figs. 1E and 9C). The IFPPs connect
tightly to those of the next cell with a knuckle-like junc-
tion (Fig. 9, E–G). The junction is generally of the 1:1type (Fig. 9, E and F), but occasionally single 1:2 junc-tions are seen (Fig. 1, G and H). In the strains from the
Gulf of Naples, contiguous 1:2 connections detected as
a zigzag line have been observed along half a cell cir-cumference (Fig. 9G). The TRP has a long, external,
trumpet-shaped process, located near the central an-
nulus or midway between the annulus and the valvemargin (Fig. 9, C and D). The IRPP is shorter and sit-
uated slightly inside the ring of marginal intercalary FPs
(Fig. 9E). In the copulae, the transverse ribs are wellsiliciﬁed and interspaced by rows of pores (Fig. 9H).Material examined: SZN-B141, SZN-B142, SZN-
B143, SZN-B144, SZN-B145, and CCMP 788.
Notes: This species is considered tropical and sub-
tropical, with a distribution not beyond 30 1North of
the equator, in the western Atlantic Ocean (Hulburt
and Guillard 1968). Strains examined were isolated
from the Gulf of Mexico and from the Gulf of Naples,where it is recorded in September and October at con-
centrations up to 2.6 /C210
2cells/C1mL/C01.
Sequence data. The 24 nuclear-encoded SSU rDNA
sequences of Skeletonema strains aligned readily by
eye, and only a few gaps needed to be introduced.
The alignment contained 1805 positions, of which 61were parsimony informative . Eight distinct genotypic
groups were recognizable, differing in at least ﬁve
positions. Sequences within a group were identical or,in a few cases, differed only in one or two positions.The SSU sequences of CCAP1077/3, CCAP1077/7,
CCAP1077/8, and CCMP1009 were obtained at SZN
a n dc o m p a r e dw i t ht h o s ea v a i l a b l ei nG e n B a n k .W eonly observed differences in two base pairs in the case
of CCAP1077/3 and in one base pair in the case of
CCAP1077/8; both sequences were retained in thefurther analyses. SSU sequences of S. tropicum and
S. japonicum failed to amplify.
The SSU sequences were aligned subsequently with
ones from other Thalassiosiraceae as well as fromDitylum brightwellii (West) Grunow in Van Heurck,
Lithodesmium undulatum Ehrenberg, Helicotheca tamesis
(Shrubsole) Ricard, and Bellerochea malleus (Brightwell)
van Heurck, all from GenBank (Table 1). Nineteen
extra gaps were needed, but the original alignment
among the Skeletonema sequences was retained with
the addition of the outgroups. The obtained align
ment contained 297 parsimony informative sites.
Both the hLRTs and the AIC selected a transitionalmodel (A $C5G$T51, A$T5C$G51.7026,
A$G53.3875, and C $T54.8617) with unequal
base composition (A 50.2677, C 50.1937, G 50.2527,
T50.2859), a gamma distribution shape parameter of
0.7448, and a proportion of invariable sites of 0.5389
(TIM þIþG). All ML analyses of the SSU data set were
constrained with these settings.
An ML analysis with all sequences (except identical
ones) resulted in a single ML tree (Fig. 10). If the four
non-thalassiosiracean taxa were chosen as outgroups,Skeletonema grouped in a compact clade within a grade
ofThalassiosira .Porosira pseudodenticulata (Hustedt)
Jouse´and Lauderia annulata Cleve formed a clade
with conspicuously long end branches. The tree re-vealed four lineages within Skeletonema . In the ﬁrst,
sequences of S. grethae were recovered in a clade with
S. pseudocostatum as sister clade. The second lineage
was sister to lineage 1 and included all four sequenc-
es of S. menzelii . T wo sequences of Mediterranean
S. menzelii strains were virtually identical but differed
markedly from those of CCMP787 and CCMP790. In
the third lineage, identical sequences of S. dohrnii
formed a sister clade to one with identical sequenc-es of S. marinoi . The fourth lineage only containedDIANA SARNO ET AL. 166S. subsalsum . Relationships among the four lineages
were unresolved.
The ML analyses with or without Porosira pseudo-
denticulata and Lauderia annulata , with or without
Detonula confervacea , and with or without Ditylum bright-
wellii ,Lithodesmium undulatum ,Helicotheca tamesis ,a n d
Bellerochea malleus resulted in the same ML topologywithin Skeletonema . Therefore, we used Thalassiosira
pseudonana Hasle et Heimdal and Thalassiosira sp. 1 as
outgroups to calculate the ML bootstrap values for theclades within Skeletonema . These two taxa were always
resolved as the nearest neighbors of Skeletonema .
The MP analysis resulted in a different topology
among the ingroup taxa (data not shown). As in Figure

became sister to the clade with S. dohrnii andS. marinoi .
The 35 nuclear-encoded partial LSU rDNA se-
quences of Skeletonema aligned without problems into
785 positions. Ten distinct genotypes were recovered
among the sequences. Skeletonema LSU sequences were
subsequently aligned with ones from Thalassiosira rotula
Meunier and Thalassiosira sp. 2 strain SZN-B101. Elev-
en extra gaps needed to be introduced, but the align-ment among the Skeletonema sequences remained
unaltered. The ﬁnal alignment included 122 parsimo-
ny informative sites. Both hLRT and AIC tests selecteda general time reversible model (A $C50.9493,A$G51.9029, A $T52.3025, C $G50.8701,

equal base composition (A 50.2591, C 50.1999,
G50.2902, T 50.2508), a proportion of invariable
sites of 0.6281, and a gamma shape parameter of1.8414 (GRT þIþG).
The ML tree inferred from the partial LSU sequenc-
es is presented in Figure 11. All species were mon-ophyletic, and most of them were well resolved,
though S. dohrnii obtained low support (63%) and
S. grethae obtained no support at all. The latter lacked
any synapomorphies among their LSU sequences.

DISCUSSION
Species circumscription. The eight taxa examined in
this study can be arranged into four main morpho-
logical groups, which correspond to the lineages I to
IV identiﬁed in the phylogenetic tree. These groupsare quite distinct from each other, whereas the inter-
specific differences within the groups are generally
more subtle. Figure 12 shows the most informativemorphological characters plotted on the ML phylo-gram inferred from the partial LSU sequences.
The four species in group I, S. pseudocostatum ,S.
tropicum , and the two new species, S. grethae and S.
japonicum , share TFPPs with narrow distal ends and
truncated, spiny, or claw-shaped margins. The distal
parts of the IFPPs are also narrow in the fork-, knot-,and knuckle-like junctions, although they can be wider
in the 1:2 junction mode in S. tropicum and S. japoni-
cum. Within each species, a variable amount of silica is
present in the junctions, generating further morpho-
logical variability.
The new species S. grethae was previously considered
true S. costatum (Medlin et al. 1991), but a study of the
type material of S. costatum (Zingone et al. 2005) con-
tradicted this. In contrast to S. grethae ,S. costatum is a
robust species with closed and ﬂattened IFPPs, 1:2junctions with a zigzag connection line, claw-ended
TFPPs, and a long RPP located marginally in all valves.
Skeletonema grethae resembles instead a second morph
found in the type material of S. costatum , which has
been identiﬁed as a new species, S. grevillei Sarno et
Zingone (Zingone et al. 2005). Like S. grethae ,S.
grevillei has TFPPs with narrow tips and truncated or
spiny margins and 1:1, knuckle-like junctions. Never-
theless, S. grevillei has two distinctive features, a scallop-
like ornamentation joining the bases of the FPPs andthe TRP close to the ring of the TFPs, which discount
any relationships with any known Skeletonema species.
Medlin et al. (1991) showed that S. grethae was dis-
tinct from S. pseudocostatum because its FPPs lack a tu-
bular base. The present study shows that a tubular base
is only present in the TFPPs of S. pseudocostatum and
not in IFPPs. The IFPPs of S. grethae and S. pseudo-
costatum are indistinguishable. Medlin et al. (1991)
could not compare the intercalary valves of the twospecies because their cultures of S. pseudocostatum did
not form permanent chains.
The other new species in group I, S. japonicum , also
has a tubular base to its TFPPs, like S. pseudocostatum .
However, S. japonicum IFPPs interlock with fork joints,
not intricate knuckles or knots, and are frequently of
the 1:2 displaced type, with a clear zigzag at the level ofthe connection. In addition, S. japonicum is more robust
than S. pseudocostatum , and the cingular bands have
rows of relatively large pores. The last member ofgroup I, S. tropicum , is the only examined Skeletonema
with many chloroplasts. Its frustule is even more ro-
bust than that of S. japonicum . In addition, junctions in
S. tropicum are always knot-like and the zigzag connec-
tion occasionally found in the Mediterranean strains of
the species involves only a few IFPPs.
Group II only includes S. menzelii , which is uniquely
noncolonial. The FPP ends are narrow as in group I
and have two or three small spines. Another distinctive
feature of S. menzelii is the delicate aspect of the
frustule, which shows no areolae and very faint ribs
on the bands. No major morphological differences
were noted between Mediterranean strains and theoriginal strain (Men 5 [CCMP787], Guillard et al.
1974). However, the regular 0.02-to 0.03- mm-diame-
ter pores described for the latter were not seen in thecultures from the Gulf of Naples.
The other two new species, S. marinoi andS. dohrnii ,
are recovered in group III and differ from all other
species in that their FPPs possess ﬂat and ﬂared tipswith dentate margins. The intercellular junctions are
apparently looser than those of the species in group I.
They commonly show the 1:2 pattern with displacedIFPPs and a zigzag line along the whole connection
between cells. The only morphological distinction be-
tween S. marinoi and S. dohrnii is the ultrastructure of
the cingular bands.
Skeletonema subsalsum (group IV) contrasts with the
other species: it has a thick frustule with a pseudolocu-
late structure and short tubular IFPPs. However, athigher salinities, 45.0 psu (Hasle and Evensen 1975,
Paasche et al. 1975), the IFPPs may be longer. IFPPs of
contiguous cells are displaced also in the 1:1 junctionand are variable in shape, sometimes with lateral con-
nections. Somewhat similar IFPPs are only found in S.
costatum . As an example, the S. subsalsum specimen in
ﬁgure 19 in Hasle and Evensen (1975) is rather similar
to the S. costatum specimen shown in Figure 3G in Zin-
gone et al. (2005). Furthermore, in S. subsalsum spec-
imens with long IFPPs, the IRPP is long and adjoinsthe tips of two IFPPs of the sibling valve in the same
fashion as in S. costatum (Zingone et al. 2005). However,
no specimens of S. costatum in the type material show
short IFPPs or a 1:1 junction type, which are frequent-
ly seen in S. subsalsum . The straight and narrow claw-
shaped TFPPs of S. costatum also look quite different
from the short and irregular ones of S. subsalsum .
Finally, the TRP is subcentral in S. subsalsum .
Although subtle, some differences among these Skel-
etonema species can be seen with high quality LM, es-
pecially when equipped with Nomarski differential
interference contrast. For example, the shape of
TFPPs can be used to distinguish S. dohrnii and
S. marinoi (with their ﬂared TFPP tips, Fig. 1D) from
S. grethae ,S. japonicum ,a n d S. pseudocostatum (with
their narrow TFPP tips, Fig. 1F). Other species areeven easier to recognize; for example, S. tropicum
has numerous chloroplasts per cell (Fig. 9A), and
S. menzelii always occurs as single cells or pairs of cells
(Fig. 6A).DIANA SARNO ET AL. 170Skeletonema potamos andS. cylindraceum have not been
incorporated in this study because we had no access tolive material. Skeletonema potamos (Hasle and Evensen
1976) is a freshwater species and is distinct from all
other Skeletonema spp. because it possesses tubular
FPPs, as observed in S. subsalsum , but with no appar-ent suture along their length. In addition, S. potamos
IFPPs do not interlock with opposite IFPPs but simplyabut against the sibling valve face, probably fusing with
it.Skeletonema cylindraceum has been described from the
Caspian Sea (Makarova and Proschkina-Lavrenko1964). Like S. tropicum , this species possesses several

Phylogeny. Specimens belonging to the same mor-
phologically circumscribed species share identical
LSU sequences, and their SSU sequences are alsosimilar or identical. Specimens belonging to morpho-
logically distinct species possess distinct SSU and LSU
sequences. The only case where this pattern does notapply is S. menzelii , which shows profound differences
in LSU and SSU sequences among strains despite
their similar morphology. However, detailed mor-phological analyses were not performed on this spe-
cies in this study, which was focused on species
diversity in S. costatum- like species. Skeletonema men-
zelii was added as a putative outgroup based on its
distinct morphology, but rather unexpectedly, the
phylogenies recovered it among the ingroup taxa.
The significance of the molecular differences foundamong Skeletonema s p e c i e si sg e n e r a l l yh i g h ,a sf o r
example in the case of the SSU rDNA sequences of S.
pseudocostatum and S. grethae , which show compensa-
tory base changes (Medlin et al. 1995).
Because of their topological agreement, the trees
inferred from the SSU and LSU sequences probablyreﬂect cladogenesis within the genus. The SSU treefails to resolve the basal ramiﬁcation of Skeletonema and
the LSU tree lacks synapomorphies for S. grethae ,b u t
the four lineages are recovered in both of them, as arethe sister relationships between lineages I and II. How-
ever, the similar outcome of the trees can be partly
explained by the proximity of SSU and LSU in rDNAcistrons. Phylogenies inferred from unrelated DNA
regions, preferably from mitochondria and plastids,
are needed to conﬁrm patterns revealed by ribosomalgenes. Unfortunately, the interspecific comparison re-
mains incomplete because the SSU of S. tropicum andS.
japonicum failed to amplify. This could be because of
inserts in the SSU, which can thwart direct PCR am-pliﬁcation of this region. Failure to amplify the SSU
region in S. tropicum strains could be viewed as a taxon-
deﬁning character in its own behalf because it occurredin all strains of this species that we tested.
Our results conﬁrm the conclusion that S. grethae
(asS. costatum ) and S. pseudocostatum are different spe-
cies (Medlin et al. 1991) because the sequence differ-
ence in the SSU gene region is corroborated by much
more conspicuous differences along the LSU region.In addition, several additional strains of S. pseudo-
costatum all share identical SSU and LSU sequences.
This study also found that S. tropicum is more closely
related to S. pseudocostatum than to S. grethae . Although
S. dohrnii ,S. grethae ,S. japonicum ,S. marinoi , and
S. pseudocostatum were formerly treated as S. costatum ,
they do not group together. Morphologically distinctspecies, such as S. tropicum andS. menzelii are recovered
with the former ‘‘ S. costatum ’’ strains, and the fea-
tures by which they differ from the general ‘‘ S. costa-
tum’’ morphology, that is, the presence of multiplechloroplasts and the solitary habit, are evolutionary
novelties.
Assessment of the phylogene tic value of morphological
characters. An analysis of the distribution of morpho-
logical characteristics along the LSU tree of Skeleton-
emaspecies (Fig. 12) permits the recognition of ﬁve
groups of characters of different phylogenetic value.This analysis can only be provisional because as new
species and character states are discovered, the pat-
tern may change.
The ﬁrst category includes a single character show-
ing shared derived states (synapomorphies), that is, the
width of the distal parts of TFPPs, which has acquiredthe state ‘‘narrow’’ in the clade with the lineages I and
II and the state ‘‘wide’’ in lineage III ( S. marinoi andS.
dohrnii ). The second category includes characters that
also change state only once, but their derived statesdelimit only single species. Examples are the occur-
rence of multiple chloroplasts in S. tropicum , the ab-
sence of colonies in S. menzelii , and the tubular IFPPs in
S. subsalsum . Such states do not contribute to our un-
derstanding of the evolution of the genus, but they are
relevant from a taxonomic viewpoint because they arediagnostic for species.
The third set contains characters that also show
more or less discrete states, but they reveal multipleacquisitions and/or secondary losses. For instance, thecharacter ‘‘shape of the basal parts of the TFPPs’’
changes at least twice. The state ‘‘tubular in the basal
part’’ could have been acquired at the branch leadingto lineage I but was then lost secondarily in S. grethae .
Alternatively, it may have been acquired independent-
ly twice: once in S. japonicum and once along the
branch to S. tropicum and S. pseudocostatum . The char-
acter ‘‘ultrastructure of the bands’’ shows an even
more complex pattern of state changes with severalalternative explanations for acquisitions and secondary
losses of the row of pores between ribs in the copulae.
As in the case of the second category, such charactersdo not really help in the reconstruction of the evolu-tionary history of the genus, but they are informative
from a taxonomic viewpoint and help deﬁne a species.
The fourth category of characters includes most
morphometric parameters, for example, the number
of cells per colony, valve diameter, number of FPs per
valve, which show considerable variation both amongand within species, ranges often overlapping between
species (Tables 2 and 3), as already noted by Hasle
(1973). Such characters are neither phylogeneticallynor systematically informative, though extreme valuescan help in the identiﬁcation of single species. The
poor diagnostic value of gross morphology is predict-
able, because size reduction accompanying the vegeta-tive cell cycle profoundly inﬂuences cell outlines
(Round et al. 1990) and other features that depend
on size, for example, the number of FPPs per valve.Perhaps some of these characters may prove to be in-
formative if they are analyzed with geometric morpho-
metrics (unpublished data). In Cyclotella meneghiniana ,
certain features, such as the tilt and the size of the FPDIANA SARNO ET AL. 172tube, were recovered by the geometric morphometric
analysis as being phylogenetically informative (unpub-
lished data).
A ﬁfth set of characters shows scarcely any variability
inSkeletonema species. Examples are the states such as
‘‘number and spatial density of areolae,’’ ‘‘spatial den-
sity of FPPs,’’ and ‘‘density of ribs in cingular bands,’’which vary little among Skeletonema species. In contrast,
some of these characters are variable and diagnostic for
species in the genus Thalassiosira .
Not only morphometric but also ultrastructural fea-
tures of the frustule mentioned above are susceptible
to intraspecific variation. One example is the shape of
the TFPPs, which in S. grethae andS. tropicum can either
be truncated distally or end with a claw-like or a spiny
protrusion. Another example are the cingular bands in
S. dohrnii , which generally have hyaline areas between
ribs but show rows of pores in a few specimens from
culture material. Although observations were per-
formed on many specimens, the whole range of vari-ability of these characters still needs to be understoodfully. Several characters have already been shown to
vary under the inﬂuence of environmental factors. As
an example, S. pseudocostatum was found to grow only
as single cells in previous observations (Medlin et al.
1991), possibly because of the use of a very enriched
culture medium, with soil extract. Also in natural sam-ples from the Gulf of Naples, this species is generally
recorded as single cells during the late spring–summer
blooms (Ribera d’Alcala `et al. 2004). Another example
is the length of the IFPPs in S. subsalsum , which varies
in relation to salinity and osmotic pressure values
(Paasche et al. 1975). However, these ultrastructural
features generally do not show overlapping ranges intheir states. Therefore, in contrast to characters in the
fourth category, those in the ﬁfth retain phylogenetic
and/or taxonomic value despite their observed varia-bility.
Ecology. The distribution of the species identiﬁed
in this study provides, in some cases, evidence of dis-tinct ecological characteristics. The four Skeletonemaspecies found in the Gulf of Naples tend to occupy
different seasonal niches: S. dohrnii has only been
found in winter, S. pseudocostatum blooms in late
spring, early summer, S. tropicum is recorded in late
summer, early autumn, and S. menzelii is typical of
autumn. These periods are characterized by mark-
edly different conditions in terms of temperature(13–30 1C), salinity (25–38 psu), water column stabil-
ity, photoperiod, and nutrient concentrations (Ribera
d’Alcala `et al. 2004). It is hence conceivable that the
four species have different ecological requirements.Distributional differences in relation to the rainy sea-
son and the brackish conditions have also been shown
f o rf o u rd i s t i n c t Skeletonema species ( S. tropicum ,S.
pseudocostatum ,S. subsalsum ,a n d‘ ‘ S. costatum ’’) in a
tropical coastal lagoon in the Gulf of Mexico (Ake ´
Castillo et al. 1995).
Skeletonema costatum sensu lato has been recorded
from coastal areas all over the world and was hence
considered a ubiquitous species. In contrast, the newspecies recognized within ‘‘ S. costatum ’’ does not seem
to be ubiquitous. Skeletonema dohrnii is found in the
Gulf of Naples and not in the Adriatic Sea, whereas the
closely related species S. marinoi , which is abundant in
the Adriatic Sea, has not been found in the Gulf of
Naples. Nor has S. pseudocostatum been recorded in the
Adriatic Sea so far, despite its abundance in the Gulf ofNaples. This peculiar geographic distribution parallels
seasonal patterns of occurrence in suggesting differ-
ences in the ecological requirements of the distinctspecies. On the other hand, even in our limited dataset, some species already show a wide geographic
range. For instance, S. marinoi was found in such dis-
tant places as Hong Kong Bay and the Adriatic Sea,whereas S. peudocostatum has been recorded in the Aus-
tralian region and at Mediterranean sites. This is not
surprising, because similar ecological conditions areoften encountered in geographically separate areas.
The coverage of our data set is far from extensive
enough to make any ﬁrm statement on the actualbiogeography and ecology of the distinct SkeletonemaTABLE 3. Main morphological characters distinguishing Skeletonema species.

of spatial and temporal patterns of Skeletonema species
to ecological research warrants a closer examinationof many strains over the seasonal cycle across thegeographic range of the ‘‘ Skeletonema costatum ’’ species
complex.
T oward a consensus species concept in Skeleton-
ema.The circumscription of the species recognized
within Skeletonema complies with the ‘‘consensus spe-
cies concept.’’ Indeed, morphologically distinct spec-imens are also genetically distinct, and genetically
identical specimens generally exhibit a highly similar
morphology. Differences observed in distributionand seasonality provide indications that Skeletonema
species also have distinct ecological requirements,
concurring with other data in the separation oftaxa. Within the species complex once perceived as‘‘Skeletonema costatum ,’’ there are cases of very clear
distinction among species for morphological, phylo-
genetic, and ecological traits. As an example, S. ma-
rinoi andS. pseudocostatum are well separated from the
molecular point of view, have distinct morphological
traits, and also occur in different areas and seasons ofthe year, at least in the Mediterranean. Even S. ma-
rinoi and S. dohrnii , which only show subtle morpho-
logical differences, are separated from the molecularpoint of view and show a distinct occurrence in Ital-ian Seas.
The biological species concept was not tested in this
study. The only Skeletonema species analyzed so far
(named S. costatum but showing many chloroplasts as
S. tropicum ) proved to be monoecious (Migita 1967),
which makes cross-fertilization tests difﬁcult to per-form. In addition, vegetative enlargement (Gallagher
1983) prevents the use of size as a cue for sexual re-
production. These limitations warrant the use of spe-cific molecular tools to verify gamete fusion between
different strains and the fecundity of their offspring.
Nevertheless, our results reveal, albeit indirectly, thatthe taxa are reproductively isolated entities. If they in-terbred freely with one another and if their offspring
were perfectly viable, then they would neither show
conspicuous morphological and genetic differencesnor any correlation between morphology and se-
quence data. Moreover, one would not expect the
large SSU differences among the various clades andcompensatory base changes between sequences in dif-
ferent clades (Medlin et al. 1995).
High diversity within Skeletonema was detected for
the ﬁrst time by Gallagher (1980, 1982) based on sig-nificant differences in allozyme patterns among series
of ‘‘Skeletonema costatum ’’ strains collected in the sum-
mer and winter blooms in Narragansett Bay. In addi-tion, Gallagher and coworkers (Gallagher 1982,
Gallagher et al. 1984) demonstrated that strains ex-
hibiting markedly different allozyme patterns also be-haved differently under a series of experimental
conditions; for example, summer bloomers grew fast-
er in summer conditions (20 1C) than in winter ones.
These authors ﬁrst concluded that blooms inNarragansett Bay were composed of different Skeleton-
emaspecies or even different assemblages of species. In
later studies, however, the genetic distinction betweenbloom periods tended to collapse with increasing num-bers of individuals because intermediate allozyme pat-
terns were encountered. Gallagher (1994) then
concluded that distinct allozyme patterns were ex-tremes in the cline of a single genetically diverse spe-
cies. Our results indicate that the earlier conclusion
(Gallagher 1982, Gallagher et al. 1984) was probablycorrect and that different species occur in Narragan-
sett Bay at different seasons. The shared bands ob-
served by Gallagher (1994) might either representancestral alleles present in sister species or result
from incidental interspecific hybridization. Even if hy-
bridization occurred and the hybrids were able to growand divide clonally, then it would remain to ascertainwhether such hybrids can reproduce sexually. Inci-
dental hybridization may in itself constitute an effective
mode of speciation (Veron 1995, Van Oppen et al.2001, Vollmer and Palumbi 2002), but its occurrence
does not preclude the possibility that we are dealing
with distinct species.
Concluding remarks. The results of this research
showed that the easily recognizable and ubiquitous
‘‘S. costatum ’’ consists of distinct species. The star-
tlingly high diversity has been observed in a restrict-ed number of strains from a small part of the known
geographic range of ‘‘ S. costatum .’’ Hence, it is con-
ceivable that more Skeletonema species remain to be
detected. Nonetheless, the present ﬁndings have sig-
nificant implications for the diversity, phylogeny, and
ecology of this important group of coastal marinephytoplankton as well as for the practical identiﬁca-
tion of Skeletonema species in natural samples.
One of the consequences of the fact that S. costatum
is composed of several new species is that ecological
and physiological information obtained in various
studies on ‘‘ S. costatum ’’ must be reinterpreted. Differ-
ent outcomes may not only result from differentexperimental designs or ecological conditions but
also from taxonomic differences. Identiﬁcation is still
possible if experiments have been carried out onstrains maintained in culture collections or records of
Skeletonema species are accompanied by clear morpho-
logical information. For example, the Norwegian Skel-
etonema specimens in Hasle (1973) are similar to S.
marinoi , whereas some Mediterranean strains in Cas-
tellvı´(1971) show the morphological features typical
forS. pseudocostatum . However, at present the results
presented here may have a limited relevance to the
identiﬁcation of Skeletonema species from other areas.
More information on variability is needed before spe-cies can be identiﬁed reliably based on only morphol-
ogy. Nevertheless, there is evidence that not all the
species are ubiquitous or perennial. It is therefore like-ly that local identiﬁcation keys will be built once that
complete information on single areas is gathered.
rRNA probes are being developed for each ofthe new species here plus S. pseudocostatum in hopesDIANA SARNO ET AL. 174of elucidating the true distribution of these spe-
cies. rRNA probes can be applied to Lugol and
formalin preserved material so archived material canbe reanalyzed.
It has been postulated that marine microalgal spe-
cies diversity is very low, compared with higher plants,
and that many species are ubiquitous and ecologicallyplastic. Indeed, the lack of transport barriers in the
aquatic environments apparently offers ample oppor-
tunity for huge numbers of small organisms to betransported from one site to another (Finlay and
Clarke 1999, Finlay 2002). However, if apparently
well-deﬁned species consist of several genetically, bio-logically, and ecologically distinct species, this concept
must be reexamined. The results of this investigation,
as well as those on other marine microalgae such asPhaeocystis (Medlin et al. 1994, Zingone et al. 1999),
Scrippsiella (Montresor et al. 2003), and Pseudo-nitzschia
(Lundholm et al. 2003, Orsini et al. 2004), reveal sur-
prisingly high diversity within taxa known to microal-gal taxonomists for more than a century. Considering
that other species have been studied less and/or never
cultured, whereas yet more are still being discovered, amore cautious approach to deﬁning phytoplankton di-
versity is highly recommended.
