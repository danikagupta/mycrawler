EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report provides an update and further assess -
ment of the sources, fate and effects of microplastics 
in the marine environment, carried out by Working Group 40 (WG40) of GESAMP (The Joint Group of Experts on Scientific Aspects of Marine Protection). It follows publication of the first assessment report in this series in April 2015 (GESAMP 2015). The issue of marine plastic litter was raised during the inaugural meeting of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) in June 2014. Delegates from 160 countries adopted Resolution 1/6 on ‘Marine plastic debris and microplastics’ (Annex I). The resolution welcomed the work being undertaken by GESAMP on microplastics and requested the Executive Director of UNEP to carry out a study on marine plastics and microplastics. This was to be based on a combination of existing and new studies, including WG40. This provided the motivation for GESAMP to revise the original terms of reference to reflect both the request from UNEP to contribute to the UNEA study, and the key recommendations from the WG40 2015 report. 
Each main section begins with key messages followed 
by a short summary of related findings from the first report. Each section ends with conclusions, knowledge gaps and research priorities. Greater effort has been made to describe the nature, distribution and magni -
tude of sources of macro- and microplastics. These are described by sea-based and land-based sectors, together with the main entry points to the ocean. Spatial (regional) and temporal differences in both sources and entry points are examined. One previously unrecognized source of secondary microplastics high -
lighted is debris from vehicle tyres. 
The distribution of microplastics in the five main ocean 
compartments (sea surface, water column, shoreline, seabed and biota) are described, together with the transport mechanisms that regulate fluxes between compartments. Regional ‘hot-spots’ of sources, dis -
tribution and accumulation zones are reported, in response to the UNEA request. 
The effects of microplastics on marine biota have been 
explored in greater detail.
Greater attention has been given to the interaction of 
microplastics with biota. A comprehensive literature review has been assembled with tables summarising the occurrence of microplastics in a wide variety of marine organisms and seabirds. There does appear to be an association between uptake of microplastics and changes in the physiological or biochemical response in some species, observed in laboratory experiments. It is not clear whether this will be significant at a popula -
tion level with current observed microplastic numbers. The current understanding of the interaction of plastic-associated chemicals with biota is reviewed, using laboratory-based experiments, theoretical studies and field-based observations. It appears very likely that this interaction will be dependent on: i) the species; ii) the relative degree of contamination of the plastic, the biota concerned and the marine environment (sediment, water, foodstuff) in that region; iii) the size, shape and type of plastics; and iv) several time-related variables (e.g. environmental transport, gut transfer, absorption/desorption rates). This remains a contentious area of 
research. The occurrence of nano-sized plastics in the marine environment has yet to be established and we are dependent on drawing inferences from other fields of science and medicine when considering possible effects. Microplastics can act as vectors for both indig -
enous and non-indigenous species. Examples include pathogenic Vibrio bacteria, eggs of marine insects and the resting stages of several jellyfish species.
A new section considers the possible effect of micro -
plastics on commercial fish and shellfish. Microplastics 
have been found in a variety of commercial fish and shellfish, including samples purchased from retail out -
lets. Generally the numbers of particles per organism are very small, even for filter-feeding bivalves in coastal areas bordered by high coastal populations. At these levels it is not considered likely that microplastics will influence the breeding/development success of fish stocks (food security) nor represent an objective risk to human health (food safety). However, data are rather scarce and this is an area that justifies further attention.
The economic aspects of microplastic contamination 
are considered in another new section. This relies heavily on studies looking at the effects of macro-debris on various sectors (e.g. fisheries, shipping, tourism, waste management), given the paucity of knowledge of direct economic effects of microplastics. Acting on macroplastics may be easier to justify, as the social, ecological and economic effects are easier to demonstrate. This in turn will reduce the quantities of secondary microplastics being generated in the ocean. One significant cost that may be incurred would be the provision of wastewater treatment capable of filtering out microplastics. Such systems are relatively common in some rich countries but absent in many develop -
ing nations. Clearly, there are many other reasons to introduce improved wastewater treatment (nutrient reduction, disease prevention), with reduction in micro -
plastics being an additional benefit. 
Social aspects are focused around factors influencing 
long-term behaviour change, including risk percep -
tions, perceived responsibility and the influence of demographics. This is key to implementing effective, acceptable measures.
A separate section summarizes good practice guid -
ance on sampling and analysis at sea, in sediments and 
in biological samples. There are no global ‘standards’ but if these guidelines are followed then it will be easier to generate quality-assured data, in a cost-effective manner, and for datasets to be compared and com -
bined with more confidence.
The final main section presents an initial risk assess -
ment framework. Having described some basic prin -
ciples about risk, likelihood and consequences the 
section provides a conceptual framework and two case examples (one real, one hypothetical) of how the frame -
work can be utilized.
The report concludes with key conclusions and recom -
mendations for further research.GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  13

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Context
Concern about the quantity of plastic and microplastic 
debris in the ocean has grown rapidly in recent years. This has been evident in terms of the increased interest from governments, Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs), regional seas organizations, the private sec -
tor, environmental NGOs, special interest groups, the media and the scientific community. 
GESAMP recognized the importance of this topic 
within its Emerging Issues programme. It undertook a number of scoping activities that culminated in set -
ting up a working group (Working Group 40, WG40) to undertake an initial assessment of: ‘Sources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine environment – a global assessment’, published in April 2015 (GESAMP 2015
1). The assessment included a number of recom -
mendations for further investigation, to cover certain topics in greater depth or introduce new elements into the assessment.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to deliver the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
3 The issue of marine plas -
tics and microplastics was raised during the inaugural meeting of the UNEA in June 2014. Delegates from 160 countries adopted Resolution 1/6 on ‘Marine plastic debris and microplastics’ (Annex I).
Paragraph 12 of Resolution 1/6 reads:‘[The United Nations Environment Assembly] … 
Welcomes the initiative by the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection to produce an assessment report on microplastics, which is scheduled to be launched in November 2014 [GESAMP 2015]’. 
Paragraph 14 of Resolution 1/6 included a request to 
the Executive Director of UNEP to carry out a study:
‘… building on existing work and taking into account 
the most up-to-date studies and data, focusing on: 
(a)

1.3 S tructure and scope of the report
The current report takes the outcome of the first 
GESAMP assessment as a starting point. The sections on sources and fate have been expanded, and poten -
tial ecological impacts investigated in greater depth. A separate section is devoted to the potential impacts of microplastics on commercial fish and shellfish species. Greater effort has been directed at assessing social and economic aspects of microplastics, drawing on related literature as appropriate. A separate section discusses advances on sampling and analytical tech -
niques, and the advantage of harmonized approaches, to allow greater data sharing and comparison. Risk assessment, to support decision making, is also given more prominence.
The intention is for the current report to provide a more 
robust evidence base to focus and support the devel -
opment and implementation of potential solutions to reduce the impact of marine microplastics. It provides some examples, but does not advocate potential solu -
tions and this would have been outside the scope of the ToRs. The report covers the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact components of the DPSIR conceptual frame -
work for the adaptive management of environmen -
tal stressors (Figure 1.1). The Response component, devising possible microplastic reduction measures, is discussed in the UNEA report (UNEP 2016).

5.
  Methods of defining micr
oplastics, sampling and measurement vary considerably among studies, source 
sectors and geographical regions making it difficult to synthetize data across studies.
2.1 L essons from the first assessment
Identification of sources is important to accurately assess the quantities of microplastics entering the marine environment, to provide an indication of region -
al or local ‘hot-spots’ of occurrence and accumulation, and to develop and monitor mitigation efforts and poli -
cies (GESAMP 2015). The identified challenges include uncertainties in the sources as well as the pathways by which microplastics arrive at a specific destination. There are two types of microplastics sources. 
The primary sources are manufactured microplastics 
that were designed for particular applications. These primary particles may be released from discrete point sources such as plastic processing plants (produc -
tion pellets or powders for injection moulding) or from more diffuse and regular source points such as popu -
lated places along rivers and coastlines (microbeads, industrial abrasives). There is a lack of quantitative data on inputs via small, but regular and persistent, losses of primary microplastics from multiple sources (GESAMP  2015). The secondary sources are micro -
plastics created by fragmentation and degradation of macroplastics, including fibres from synthetic textiles. Estimating the source distribution of secondary micro -
plastics inevitably relies on accurate assessment of the distribution and sources of macroplastics and on a good understanding of the degradation process.
The discussion on primary and secondary sources 
of microplastics is further developed in this chapter. Particularly, fragmentation and degradation of plastics in the environment is emphasized as it plays a major role in the release of secondary microplastics. Sources of microplastics are presented by sectors and charac -
terized under producers/converters, sectoral consum -
ers (land-based and sea-based), individual consumers and waste management. The main pathways from the source sectors into the marine environment are reviewed including riverine, coastal, marine-based and atmospheric inputs. The pathways are also categorized between primary and secondary sources of micro -
plastics. Finally, this chapter provides a discussion on spatial and temporal variability of microplastic sources.2.2 P rimary and secondary sources of 
microplastics
2.2.1  Over view of microplastic sources
Marine debris has become a global environmental 
issue and a growing concern since the rise of the plastic industry in the mid-1950s. Annual global plastic production has increased steadily and reached 311 mil -
lion tonnes in 2014. The majority is used to make items of packaging and for construction. Smaller proportions are used in a range of other applications, including the automotive industry, agriculture and for electrical and electronic components. See Figure 2.1 below for an example of plastic production data by sector in the EU. 
The increase in plastic use has been accompanied 
by an increase in plastic litter in the ocean. The total number of macro- and microplastic objects has the potential to affect marine life with associated socio-economic consequences. As a result, it is important that we understand the sources and sinks of plastic debris into the ocean so that we can identify poten -
tial risks. 
In addition to understanding sources and sinks, it is 
important that we come to an agreement on how to categorize the different types of debris. Microplastics have been attributed to several different size ranges which can sometimes be confusing and/or hinder data comparisons. It has become common to use the defi -
nition of any plastic particle < 5 mm in diameter, which 
includes particles in the nano-size range (Table 2.1).18  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANTable 2.1 Summary of size definitions of marine plastic litter and common sources

mented, mostly due to weathering degradation, into microplastic particles.

2.2.2
 Fragmentation and degradation
T
he widespread degradation and fragmentation of 
plastic is one of the key factors causing microplastics to be ubiquitous in the marine environment. While there is extensive literature on the loss of mechanical integ -
rity of plastics with weathering on both land and beach (O’Brine and Thompson 2010), as well as the ocean environments (Andrady 2011), studies on fragmenta -
tion as a consequence of weathering are sparse in the literature. This is partly due to lack of historical inter -
est in the degradation process past the point where a product cannot be used in the intended application – durability is a key quality of most plastics. The time scale for which we can relate is also an important fac -
tor. Plastic was introduced in the 1950s, which means that observations can only be carried from that period of time, and by controlled laboratory experiments, and the long-term behaviour of plastics in the marine envi -
ronment is essentially unknown. Weathering related degradation results in a progression of changes that include the loss in mechanical integrity, embrittlement, further degradation and fragmentation. Biodegradation of plastics occurs at a very slow rate; only 1 % to 1.7 % 
decrease in mass was observed in laboratory-acceler -
ated degradation of PE over a 30-day duration by micro -
organisms isolated from marine waters (Harshvardhan and Jha 2013). Fragmentation, however, is most likely to occur at advanced stages of degradation well beyond embrittlement for most plastics, mainly due to expo -
sure to solar UV radiation (Andrady 2011). As a result, not only are the fragmentation kinetics and processes very poorly understood, but there are no reliable esti -
mates of the time to embrittlement of different types of plastics exposed to weathering either on land or at sea under a specified set of conditions. 
The general methodology currently used in studies 
is to expose samples in the field followed by assess -
ing their mechanical integrity in laboratory tests. A somewhat different approach to studying the deg -
radation and fragmentation of plastics in the ocean was pursued in a recent Clean Sea project (Gerritse and Vethaak 2015). This involved the use of a marine GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  19
mesocosm exposed to fluorescent lighting. The degrada -
tion of various ‘compostable’ and ‘durable’ plastic polymer  
varieties was monitored using changes in their electrical 
resistance, weight loss and generation of microplastic particles.
Though not experimentally demonstrated as yet, model 
calculations suggest that smaller plastic particles degrade and split into smaller fragments at faster rates (Gerritse and Vethaak 2015). The larger specific surface area generated with fragmentation allows improved contact with water/sediment with faster leaching or sorption rates for chemicals and additional space for biofouling. In addition, it exposes a larger area for chemical, physical and biological degradation reac -
tions (Gewert et al. 2015)
The degradation processes that result in converting 
macroplastics or meso-plastics debris into micro -
plastics likely continues beyond this stage to nano-sized plastics ( <100 nm). In fact, if the microplastic is exposed to solar UV radiation the increased surface 
area would accelerate such degradation. For example, the formation of nanoplastics (mainly in the 100 to 500 nm range) occurs during the degradation of natural rub -
ber latex condoms in outdoor freshwater microcosms (Lambert et al. 2013). However, nanoplastics have not been detected as yet in the marine environment (mainly due to the logistics challenges in analytical procedures) and the range of marine organisms exposed to them are unknown (GESAMP 2015; Koelmans et al. 2015). 
Two recent studies estimating microplastic abundance 
on the ocean surface observed a 100x reduction of small microplastics ( <1 mm) when compared to larger 
microplastics (1 to 5 mm) (Cózar et al. 2014; Eriksen et al. 2014). While we may suppose nanoplastics are abundant in the marine environment (Andrady 2011; GESAMP 2015) we may not find them on the sea sur -
face in large quantities if other mechanisms of chemi -
cal and biological degradation, current dynamics and buoyancy reduce their numbers. 
Box 2.1 On bioplastics and biodegradability
Plastics from biomass feedstockWhile a great majority of the plastics produced globally are based on non-renewable fossil fuel resources, plastic 
resins can be made from biomass feedstock as well. There are basically three categories of plastics from renewable biomass resources: a) Biopolymers or bioplastics; b) Bio-derived plastics; and, c) Bio-based plastics. The difference between these categories depends on the role played by the bio-resource in producing the resin.
With biopolymers such as cellulose, chitin or the bacterial copolymer poly hydroxyl butyrate valerate [PHBV], the 
polymer is created in the form it is available for human use by the plant or the microorganism. The production involves the mere extraction of the plastic from biomass. With bio-derived plastics such as rayon or chitosan, however, the polymer extracted from biomass is chemically converted into a modified polymer that has useful properties in practi -
cal applications. Cellulose that is partially acetylated into cellulose acetate for use in cigarette filters or regenerated as cellophane or rayon fibre and deamination of chitin from crab shells into chitosan are examples of such conversions. Bio-based polymers in contrast to the above are man-made polymers using monomers that are derived from bio -
mass. For instance, plant carbohydrates might be fermented into alcohols that can be used to make bio -polyethylene. 
The polyethylene produced is similar in structure and properties to polyethylene made from fossil fuel feedstock and the prefix bio-merely indicates the origin of the monomer. With complex monomers, a part of the monomer might be 
bio-based (with the rest derived from fossil fuel) yielding a partially bio-based plastic.
Biodegradable plasticsBiodegradable polymers are able to undergo degradation into small molecules such as CO
2, CH4 and H2O due to the 
action of biota, usually microorganisms at a rate that is much faster than that for common plastics. The bio -prefix in 
bio-PE, bio-PET or bio -PA does not suggest that these polymers will therefore also be biodegradable. Some biopoly -
mers, bio-derived plastics and bio-based plastics are indeed biodegradable. However, others in the same categories, 
such as the bio-based plastic bio -PE or the bio -derived plastic, fully acetylated cellulose, are not biodegradable. 
Knowing the nature of feedstock used to make the plastic does not allow a determination as to the biodegradability of the material.
Biodegradability and marine environmentThe ocean (marine) environment is NOT a disposal environment like composting or anaerobic digestion which are 
sound end-of-life options for food and bio-waste components of the solid waste stream along with truly and com -
pletely biodegradable-compostable plastics. These compostable plastics meet the specification requirements of International Standards and are certified to these standards by independent third party organizations. Several poly -
mer materials are being offered in the marketplace as “marine biodegradable” based on 30
oC temperature laboratory 
scale experiments (ASTM D6691) demonstrating biodegradability. Another ASTM test method measures biodegrad -
ability in seawater sediment and the test temperature can be as high as 28oC. However, ocean temperatures drop 
precipitously as you go down in depth (4oC on reaching 2000 m) and the ocean environment can be much different 
and less active than the lab test environment. So these marine biodegradable plastics (which show complete biode -
gradability in a lab test method) could remain in ocean environments for very long periods of time and cause serious environmental impacts that have been recorded for ocean microplastics.20  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN2.3 S ources by sector
2.3.1  Sources in brief
Mac
roplastics and microplastics entering the ocean 
come from a wide variety of land- and sea-based 
sources. Table 2.2 provides a summary of the main sectors identified, the types of plastic products or waste and the typical entry points to the ocean. The source sectors are categorized by producer/consumer responsibility during the lifetime of a plastic product following the flow of plastic through the economy. This is further detailed in Chapter 6 on socio-economic aspects (Figure 6.1). There are significant regional differences in the relative importance of sources and entry points.

2.3.2
 Producers and converters
P
lastic pre-production resin pellets are manufactured 
and transported to a converting facility where the plas -
tic is compounded and processed into useful products. Whenever transportation of resin pellets occurs there is a potential for accidental losses of pellets, on land and sea. Use of paved surfaces and catch trays for spillage during loading/unloading of rail cars or trucks, and the use of vacuum systems can often help reduce such losses. Once in the converting facility the best prac -
tices in processing and clean-up of equipment govern further potential resin loss. The use of storm-drain filters to contain the pellets and observing strict clean-up procedures are generally recommended to limit the loss of pellets at the fabrication facilities. 
Although programmes exist to try to prevent loss, pel -
lets are found in freshwater and marine habitats. For 
example, in sediment samples analysed from European rivers, 18 % of the detected microplastic consisted of 
PS pellets (Karlsson 2015). These pellets showed visual and spectroscopic resemblance to primary pellets/powder, which was potentially intended for use in poly -
mer production. All samples were taken in rivers that flow nearby polymer plants. GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  21
In the manufacture of plastic products and packaging, 
fragments remain from trimming and tooling processes after typical injection moulding. Seams are ground down, producing microplastics. The tooling of solid blocks of plastic, using drills and milling tools also produce shavings. These fragments can be in all sizes, from the obvious microplastic to nano particles, lost as dust to the atmosphere. 
2.3.3
 Land-based sectoral consumers
Agricultur
e
There are many potential mechanisms whereby agri -
culture can be a source of microplastics. For example, 
plastics are used in agriculture for irrigation and as a mulch. They sit on the field for many months in the sun and when they are removed or disturbed by harvesting or watering can readily break down into microplastics. Runoff from agriculture can transport this material to the marine environment. 
Agriculture occupies large areas around the world, but 
the areas with nutrient-poor soils require high levels of fertilization to maintain this industry. The financial costs or time expenditure associated with the use of fertil -
izers (nitrogen, phosphate and potassium) have been prohibitively high for some farming situations. One of the newest fertilization technologies, controlled-release fertilizers (CRFs), offers a method for reducing the quantity of fertilizer needed per unit area of cropland, as well as reducing time spent in fertilization efforts (Jacobs 2005). CRFs have advantages for agriculture in reducing cost and in reducing nutrient runoff levels into water systems (Landis et al. 2009), but are introducing a new environmental impact in the form of microplas -
tics contamination.
CRFs encapsulate the N, P, and K nutrient combina -
tions within a coating often composed of a polymer 
(e.g. polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile and cellulose ace -
tate; Jarosiewicz and Tomaszewska 2003), called a nutrient pill (Landis et al. 2009). The fertilizer diffuses into the soil across this barrier (Gambash et al. 1990) over predetermined time periods (3 to 18 months), offering a continuous nutrient supply to the plant roots. The overall fertilization level required is reduced com -
pared to traditional fertilizers because it reaches the plants as needed over time (Goertz 2000), eliminating the need for over-fertilization, a problem for the sur -
rounding aquatic environment (Carpenter et al. 1998). This should lower the levels of nutrient runoff into water systems from those crops (Sharpley et al. 1994), thus lessening eutrophication that often occurs from these pollution sources (Vollenweider 1968; Vollenweider and Kerekes 1980). 
This benefit is not without cost, however, because 
when nutrients are released, the remaining pill does not degrade. In addition, because the longer release periods are the more commonly desired, the thickness of this polymer layer must be increased proportionally to that intended release duration (Jacobs 2005). Surface run -
off due to rainfall events washes soils from agricultural areas into aquatic systems. These plastics will be car -
ried along with those soils and enter both river and estu -
arine systems along with surface soils. CRF fertilizers are applied either by being mixed into the soil or top dressed (Landis et al. 2009), depending on the particu -
lar crop being grown, with top dressed soils particularly at risk for microplastics runoff. Because the quantity of expended pills will increase within soils when these CRF fertilizers are reapplied every 1 to 2 years, this risk will increase over time. The volume of CRF in use in drainage basins and coastal regions, as well as the relative percentages of mixed and top-dressed usage, should be used to estimate the quantity of microplas -
tics being released into aquatic ecosystems per year. Although there are no estimates available to date on the potential of CRFs to contribute to microplastics contamination in the ocean, there is an increasing trend associated with this risk due to the increasing use of fertilizers in agriculture (Heffner 2009).
Construction
Potential discharges related to construction should 
consider three phases used to describe the life cycle of infrastructure: i) construction, ii) life in service and iii) decommissioning / demolition. Although little infor -
mation is available on the relative importance of the various entry points from the construction sector into the marine environment, it is clear that construction represents a major use of new plastics, contributing over 20 % of annual production in Europe during 2013 
(plus plastics used to package items in the construc -
tion industry) (PlasticsEurope 2014). This plastic will reach the end of its life and/or become fragmented if not adequately deposited or recycled. Hence there is a considerable reservoir of plastic items within existing constructions and depending on use and management this plastic may be released as microplastics. 
Plastic products used in construction should have a 
long life-in-service in comparison to other applications where products such as single use carrier bags may have been designed to deteriorate on exposure to heat, light and oxygen. Still, there is the potential for emis -
sions of microplastics during the construction phase associated with cleaning, abrasion or grinding. At any stage in the lifetime of a piece of infrastructure, shot blasting with microplastics can be used to clean paint from surfaces prior to further construction or main -
tenance. If the particles are not contained this could lead to a direct release into the environment either as airborne dust, or soil or water (natural and sewage) contamination.
Insulating foam, typically polyurethane, is often used 
in construction as a solid board or applied in liquid form inside walls and between ceiling joists. As the foam cures, it balloons out from between wall and ceil -
ing timbers, which is usually trimmed manually with saws. This process produces tremendous amounts of microplastic residue, which are typically mediated by sweeping only. 
During construction, components may arrive pack -
aged in single use plastic film, pieces or granules, such 
as polystyrene. Some of these packaging materials may have been designed to have enhanced rates of degradation, and others may be made of conventional polymer. Unless these packaging items are contained on site and disposed of appropriately (e.g. via recycling) 22  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANthere is potential for weathering-induced fragmenta -
tion of packaging leading to the release of second -
ary microplastics. The packaging is intended to be a 
product with a short lifetime, but in some instances may be in place for months or years depending on the duration of the building phase. In addition, the only available means of disposal may be a large container open to prevailing weather conditions. While this may be appropriate to contain heavy construction materials and debris it may not be effective in retaining lighter materials such as microplastics, particularly in windy conditions.
Decommissioning or demolition may also be an emis -
sion-source of plastic to the environment. Plastic 
components of all shapes, sizes, colours and polymers are likely to be distributed throughout a particular construction. Separation, sorting and recycling could therefore be problematic. Even during the recycling process, there is still potential for emissions of micro -
plastics as the result of spillage if products are shred -
ded into small particles. Plastic items and fragments may be released to the environment or become com -
pacted into the substratum of the site.
An additional source of plastic comes from the use 
of materials in informal shelters and shanty towns. In some regions, such as West Africa, rubbish is used for land reclamation in areas when the local population are without land or conventional housing (UNEP 2016).
Despite these diverse potential sources of microplas -
tics either directly (primary) or indirectly (secondary 
microplastics) as a consequence of, and at all stages in, construction there are no published studies estimat -
ing microplastics generation from this source sector. 
Transportation on land
Robust statistical analyses can help identify key loss 
points and simple, manageable responses to reduce loss. Analysis from a continent wide survey of the Australian coastline suggests that isolated areas may be important sources of plastic pollution through ille -
gal dumping along road networks (Wilcox et al. 2014). Hence, in addition to focusing on major metropolitan areas, considering remote and regional sites is key to understanding loss rates and flows. This can help to target infrastructure and improve success of incen -
tives and enforcement actions to reduce littering and improve packaging materials recovery. 
The emission of rubber particle dust (mainly < 80 
micrometre) from tyre wear may be a major source of 
microparticles contamination to the sea (NEA 2014; Verschoor 2014). Part of the dust flies as particulate matter into the air, the rest lands directly on the road or adjoining land and from there a proportion will enter surface waters or drains. An unknown proportion will be carried to the sea. Car tyres are largely made of styrene-1.3-butadiene rubber (SBR) and recycled products made from tyre rubber. Every year, an esti -
mated quantity of 17,000 tonnes of rubber tyre-wear is released into the Dutch environment (Verschoor et al. 2014). Annual emission estimates of tyre rubber dust for Norway, Sweden and Germany are 4,500, 10,000 and 110,000 tonnes respectively (NEA 2014). Average emissions of car tyre dust for the mentioned countries range between 1 and 1.4 kg/capita/year. Further detailed studies are needed to calculate emis -
sions to the sea and to investigate the input from air transport and atmospheric deposition. 
Tourism industry
Tourism is an important economic sector. The World 
Coast Conference (1993) identified tourism as the world’s largest single industry, estimating that it con -
stitutes 5 % to 6 % of the combined Gross National 
Product (GNP) of all nations. In addition, tourism has increased over recent years into a global industry, with the World Tourism Organization (WTO) estimating over one billion tourist arrivals across the globe.
4
Since many popular tourist destinations are coastal (e.g. the Mediterranean is ranked the number one destination by the World Tourism Organization), it is reasonable to assume areas of high tourist activity are important to consider as proxy sources of marine debris. For example, it could be assumed that areas of high tourism are areas of high plastic input simply due to higher concentrations of people. It might be further argued that plastic input is exacerbated since tourists, while away from home, might be more likely to use disposable plastic (e.g. beverage bottles, food containers, etc.) compared to home where they have access to non-plastics. In addition, tourists may be less concerned about environmental impacts in places where they are not living. Conversely, it may be the case that some areas that rely on tourism as a major economic driver, particularly natural environments, are areas where clean-up efforts are more focused and numerous. Increasingly, tourism is spreading to less populated and more ‘pristine’ environments, where the infrastructure required to deal adequately with waste may be lacking. This is also the case for many Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

Fisheries
F
ishing gear may be lost at sea by accident, abandon -
ment or deliberate disposal into the marine environ -
ment. Plastic debris resulting from fishing includes 
nets, traps, lines and ropes, floats, buoys, strapping bands, bait boxes and bags, strings for packaged baits, rubber gloves, galley wastes and household trash (Sheavly 2005). According to Brown et al. (2005), some of the causes related to the disposal of nets at sea are:
•	conflict with other sectors, principally towed gear operators;
•	working in deep water;
•	poor weather conditions and/or on very hard ground;
•	very long nets or fleets of nets; and
•	using more gear than can be hauled  
regularly.

The way in which fishing gears are handled may depend 
on several conditions: fishing area/region, type of fish -
eries, type and size of the vessel and crew members. Deliberate discarding of fishing gear is also associated with illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.
Artisanal fishers, also known as small scale fishers, 
have great diversity, and thus there is no single, agreed definition for this subsector (FAO 2015). They are par -
ticularly important in developing countries for their contributions to nutrition, food security, sustainable livelihoods and poverty alleviation (FAO 2014). In many populated regions worldwide, besides a poor manage -
ment of plastic litter along the coast or inadequacy/unavailability of waste disposal/management systems, artisanal fishing may not be adequately regulated. This is either because there is no legislation or policy addressing these issues or the laws or regulations are not updated or enforced. Consequently, artisanal fish -
eries can be significant sources of ordinary and fishery-related plastics to the sea at local scales. Old struc -
tures and fishing gears are also of concern because they easily fragment generating microplastic particles. 
According to a FAO report (FAO 2014), the total num -
ber of commercial fishing vessels in the world was 
estimated to be about 4.72 million in 2012. The fleet in Asia was the largest, consisting of 3.23 million ves -
sels accounting for 68 % of the global fleet, followed 
by Africa (16 %), Latin America and the Caribbean (8 %), 
North America (2.5 %) and Europe (2.3 %). From packag -
ing items to food containers on fishing vessels, loss of plastic items overboard may occur. Although there are laws that support the management of plastic litter at sea from vessels (MARPOL Annex V and London Convention and Protocol), there are no known proto -
cols or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to cater to the day-to-day management of litter. 
Fisheries management draws on fisheries science for 
the exploitation of the fishery at a sustainable level. Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS), one of several tools of fisheries management, aims at man -
aging the activities of fishers rather than fisheries. A strong MCS programme has fisheries observers and inspectors who collect data on the activities of vessels from catches and discards to garbage in an effort to support the implementation of regulations and policies to protect the marine environment (Sherif 2014).
Aquaculture
The role of aquaculture in supplying food from the sea 
and from inland waters is growing. World aquaculture production can be categorized into inland aquaculture and mariculture. Mariculture includes production oper -
ations in the sea and intertidal zones as well as those operated with land-based (onshore) production facili -
ties and structures (FAO 2014). According to available statistical information, world food fish production by inland aquaculture and mariculture occupied 42.2 % of 
the total 158 million tonnes of production (capture fish -
eries and aquacultures) in 2012, increasing from 13.4 % 
in 1990 and 25.7 % in 2000 (FAO 2014). See Chapter 5 
for further information about this sector.Studies on the environmental impact of mariculture activities largely focus on eutrophication effects and dissolved contaminants (Gallardi 2014) and rarely examine the types and quantities of lost culture gear. There are some studies reporting on lost or discarded mariculture gear and the resulting contamination of areas with extensive aquaculture (Andréfouët et al. 2014; Bendell 2015) but also areas farther afield (Fujieda and Sasaki 2005; Hinojosa and Thiel 2009; Gago et al. 2014). No quantitative estimates of plastic input from mariculture are available even though locally these inputs can be substantial. 
Mariculture structures are either suspended from the 
sea surface (generally in waters of 10 m to 50 m depth) or in intertidal and shallow subtidal zones where they are placed directly on the bottom. The majority of mari -
culture activities use lines or cages suspended from buoyant structures, consisting of plastic buoys such as air-filled polypropylene and EPS (expanded polysty -
rene). These structures also require many lines (mostly non-buoyant plastics) and cages of various types (thin and thick filament net plastics, buoyant or non-buoyant). It is necessary to identify the types of plastics used in these activities and their potential to become sources of microplastic to the marine environment.
Aquaculture gear can be lost for the same reasons as 
capture fishing gears, e.g. wear and entanglement of structures. However, few studies have reported the cause and amount of loss or gear types (Fujieda and Sasaki 2005; Hinojosa and Thiel 2009; Heo et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2013; Hong et al. 2014; Rani et al. 2014; Al-Odaini et al. 2015). Major losses may be caused by storm events, due to detachment and breakage. In many cases, unused gear is also stored on the shore close to aquaculture centres, and as a result of weath -
ering (e.g. of EPS) large quantities of microplastics may be generated and reach the sea via run-off or wave action, but this has not been quantified. Highly diverse species and consequent methods optimized for target species probably make it difficult to identify sources. 
Aquaculture for oysters, mussels and other shellfish 
that uses EPS buoys has been considered a significant source in the Republic of Korea and Japan (Fujieda and Sasaki 2005; Lee et al. 2013; Jang et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2015). A single EPS buoy can fragment into many thousands of pieces. Most of the plastic used in aqua -
culture operations is polypropylene, which has a den -
sity of 0.9 g/cm
3 (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012) and will float 
in seawater (assuming an average seawater density of 1.02  g/cm
3), which may mean that subtidal benthic 
organisms are not ingesting much of the plastic used in the aquaculture infrastructure. However, there is evidence that over time, low density polymers may become fouled and sink (Morét-Ferguson, Law et al. 2010) (Andrady 2011; Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010), in which case these less dense plastics may become available to benthic species. Organisms may also cause destruction of aquaculture structures result -
ing in fragmentation and generation of microplastics (Davidson 2012). The fraying of plastic-based ropes in close contact with growing mussels may influence the amount of microplastics released compared to other methods with fewer plastic structures (e.g. bottom or rack culture). 24  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN
Figure 2.2 Principal types of aquaculture structures (image courtesy of M. Thiel)
Nets and cages fragment as result of wear due to foul -
ing organisms, possibly also generating large amounts 
of debris. Currents and water movement may disperse microplastics and aquaculture gear which would mask the influence of localized microplastic sources and may affect ecosystems (Astudillo et al. 2009).
Efforts to manage and reduce marine debris originat -
ing from aquaculture gear have been reported in the 
Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of China, Chile and other places (Hinojosa and Thiel 2009; Liu et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2015). However, mariculture methods, gear types, beach pollution, cause of gear loss, impacts, behaviour of gears in major countries in production and consumption should be targeted in the near future. Further research on managing and controlling this debris source is needed. See Chapter 5 for further information.
Shipping and offshore industry
Large shipping vessels with many crew members may 
carry supplies for several months. They generate solid wastes daily which may end up as marine debris if it is not secured and stored properly (Sheavly 2005). In accordance with amendments to MARPOL Annex V, as of 1 January 2013, all shippers have new respon -
sibilities including the ability for crew to discharge residues and wastewater into the marine environment. Henceforth, shippers will determine whether disposals and wastewater are harmful to the marine environment.
Cargo waste from cargo holds (wire straps, packag -
ing materials, i.e. plastic sheets, boxes) and sewage 
are among numerous waste items deposited into the marine environment from merchant ships and cruise liners. These items are most often disposed acciden -
tally through bad handling or unfavourable weather 
conditions. However, waste disposals on many vessels may be handled inadequately either due to inadequate storage facilities on board or lack of reception facilities in ports.
The shipping industry is also regarded as a primary 
source of microplastics as routine cleaning of ship hulls using plastic abrasives results in high levels of micro -
plastics being released directly into the ocean (Song et al. 2015). Mishandling of cargo or accidental spills are considered to be the main reason why high levels of microplastics have been found in some harbour sediments, particularly resin pellets. Chemical carriers carry the raw materials for plastics manufacture, such as in the form of polymers in solution or as stabilized dimers (a pair of monomers), and it is considered that these could form microplastics following operational or accidental discharge, although there is a lack of data to quantify this source.
Similarly, activities on oil and gas platforms may 
generate items which are deliberately or accidentally released into the marine environment including hard hats, gloves, storage drums, survey materials and personal waste (Allsopp et al. 2006). Undersea explora -
tion and resource extraction also contribute to marine debris (Sheavly 2005). 
Single-use plastics are also used by environmen -
tal scientists. Applications include Expendable 
Bathythermographs (XBTs) for measuring the vertical temperature of the upper ocean, meteorological bal -
loons for measuring the structure of the atmosphere, and passive drifters for measuring water currents.GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  25
2.3.5  Individual consumers
Food and drink packaging
A
round 40 % of all plastic production is used for pack -
aging (Figure 2.1). A substantial proportion of this is 
used to package food and drinks and is abundant as macro-debris in the marine environment, as evidenced in many coastal surveys by regional seas organiza -
tions, NGOs and other groups (Table 2.3). Food and drink packaging is widely used for convenience and long-term storage. Because fast-food consumption is often away from home and hence away from domestic waste management, items of fast-food packaging are commonly found as litter. These items of macro-debris are fragmenting in the marine environment and likely a major source of microplastics. Hence managing end of life packaging is of fundamental importance when considering the environment.

Cosmetics and personal care products
 M
icroplastic 
particles are widely used as abrasive agents and fill -
ers in a wide range of cosmetic products such as facial scrubs and shower gels. These particles will inevitably be released to wastewater systems upon washing or directly into aquatic environments via recreational bathing (Fendall and Sewell 2009). The total quantities of these microplastics (or microbeads as they are known commercially) can be substantial. Napper et al. 2015 estimated that one use of facial exfoliants per day by the UK population could emit to the environment 16 to 86 tonnes of PE microbeads to the environment per year. Since there is no effective way for users to dispose of these plastic particles via solid waste management, most will pass directly into wastewater and potentially the environment. Many of these particles will be captured by sewage treatment facilities. Estimates of the likely capture rate vary but it is considered inevitable that substantial quantities of microbeads pass through sewage treatment into the environment. In many developing regions there is no provision of wastewater treatment (UNEP 2016). Use of microplastics in cosmetics therefore represents a significant direct source of microplastics to the envi -
ronment. The total quantity of microplastics by weight may be small in relation to macroplastic debris and possibly also in relation to other direct sources of microplastics such as release from car tyres (see sec -
tion on terrestrial transportation above). However, the use of microplastics in PCPs is potentially avoidable since particles other than plastic can be used as alter -
natives. The issue has attracted considerable attention from NGOs (e.g. Beat the microbead campaign
5 or 
Fauna and Flora good scrub guide6). Some manufac -
turers have announced that they will voluntarily phase microbeads out of their products and some regions have introduced legislation to prohibit the use of micro -
beads in products sold within their jurisdiction. The US passed a federal law in 2015 to ban microbeads in rinse-off personal care products by 2018. 
Textile and clothing
Release of fibres from textiles is recognized as a poten -
tial large source of microplastic-sized particles. A recent 
Dutch study found a total average of 2.09x10
8 fibres/m3 
in washing machine effluent and 62 % were synthetic 
fibres (Karlsson 2015). Browne et al. (2011) found that an estimated 1,900 synthetic microfibres were rinsed out of a single piece of clothing. Industrial launder -
ing facilities and Laundromats likely expel microfibres to the atmosphere in unknown quantities. Similar to microbeads from cosmetics, fibres will be carried via wastewater to sewage treatment facilities where a proportion will be removed. However, in many parts of the world, particularly developing countries, the great majority of communities have no sewage treatment capability and microplastic contaminated wastewater is directly discharged in surface waters (Corcoran et al. 2009). The relatively conspicuous nature of fibres compared to other natural particulates might bias their detection in sediment. However, it is still clear that substantial quantities of fibres are accumulating in the environment.
2.3.6

aste management
Solid waste
Unless end-of-life items are managed within a waste 
stream, it is inevitable that they will contaminate the environment. Waste management options can range from open tips or dumps to landfills, varying levels of incineration, waste to energy and/or recycling. Still, within a waste stream, some material escapes to the environment. For example, when discarded in poorly managed dumps or land fill sites, waste will likely be transported away by winds, and may subsequently enter rivers or the sea. In addition, in some countries, there are coastal dumps where waste is deposited directly on the shoreline and then carried away by the sea (UNEP 1999).

6 http://www.fauna-flora.org/initiatives/the-good-scrub-guide/26  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANIncreasing the extent and improving the quality of 
waste management is recognized as being one of the most important immediate steps toward reducing inputs of debris to the ocean, particularly in develop -
ing countries. This is dependent on having good waste collection systems and infrastructure. Broadly speak -
ing, steps to reduce the amount of waste escaping the waste stream require increasing investment. As a consequence, leaky waste streams are more likely in emerging economies. Recycling is widely regarded as a preferred treatment option within the waste hierar -
chy (Hopewell et al. 2009). This will enable end of life items to have new value rather than becoming waste, however this will require sophisticated and expensive separation infrastructure. But, it is far preferable to reduce the quantity of plastic entering the waste stream by improved design, reducing useage (especially of single-use packaging) and re-using more durable items where practical. These concepts are further developed in UNEP (2016).
Water and wastewater
Wastewater provides a pathway for solid particles to be 
transported into aquatic habitats. This includes mac -
roplastics and microplastics. Large, solid items enter the wastewater system with sewage via toilets and can include nappies/diapers, tampons, contraceptives and cotton buds (Tudor et al. 2002). Theoretically these should be removed by primary sewage treatment pre -
venting their entry to the environment. However, during periods of heavy rainfall, the volume of water passing through sewage systems can overwhelm them allowing material to escape into the environment (Williams and Simmons 1997). As a consequence, sewage-related debris is commonly reported in marine litter surveys. Once in the environment, these items of macro-debris have the potential to fragment into smaller pieces and ultimately into microplastics. Reducing sanitary-related plastics requires a combination of education, re-design and infrastructure development (UNEP 2016).

M
icroplastics in freshwater ecosystems are increas -
ingly reported, with some available studies suggesting large contamination worldwide. Elucidating sources and pathways of microplastics in freshwater ecosys -
tems will be a major challenge for future research as this information will be the basis for management strategies and reduction measures. Reliable data on concentrations, fluxes and polymer types in conti -
nental aquatic environments, including urban water systems, are still needed as freshwater ecosystems have received far less attention despite the fact that the majority of plastic litter is being produced onshore and introduced into marine environments by rivers. 
Some studies report not only the presence of micro -
plastics in freshwater ecosystems, but show that 
contamination is as severe as in the oceans (Dris et al. 2015). In these continental waters, microplastics have been observed in both sediments (predominantly lakeshores but also riverbanks) and water samples (predominantly surface water of lakes and rivers). Both primary and secondary microplastics can enter the continental aquatic environment through several pathways. The debris enters aquatic systems directly by water run-off or via storm water and waste-  
water treatment plant (WWTP) outlets. For example, granulated polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) or polystyrene (PS) particles, used for example in skin cleaners, can be introduced into wastewater (Gregory 1996). Furthermore, laundry washing machines dis -
charge a large amount of plastic fibres into wastewater (Browne 2015; Karlsson 2015). Industrial or agricultural (Rillig 2012) activities also contribute to the amount of microplastics in freshwater/aquatic ecosystems. High amounts of microplastic particles and fibres have also been detected in the vicinity of industrial plants involved in paper production (Dubaish and Liebezeit 2013). Primary microplastics and synthetic fibres are also known to contaminate sewage sludge (Zubris and Richards 2005). These can runoff with storm water and enter freshwater habitats. Generally, studies indicate spatial associations between the types of microplas -
tics found and human activities (Eerkes-Medrano et al. 2015). 
The nature, composition or relative abundance of the 
microplastic material can sometimes aid in its identifi -
cation. For example, raw plastic (pellets and flakes) was found in the Danube, a river that has plastic production sites adjacent to it (Lechner et al. 2014). Moreover, resin pellets and microbeads were most abundant in the industrial region of Lake Huron and the densely popu -
lated and industrial Lake Erie (Eriksen et al. 2013). The lack of primary pellets but an abundance of secondary fragments on the shores of the sparsely populated mountain lakes (Garda and Hovsgol) suggested an origin from the breakdown of household items (Eerkes-Medrano et al. 2015). Finally, McCormick et al. (2014) demonstrated increases in concentrations of primary microplastics, up to 9.2 to 17.93 times, downstream from a wastewater treatment plant.
Initial freshwater studies are finding that similar physi -
cal, chemical and biological factors to those sug -
gested for marine systems contribute to microplastic 
transport and dispersal, including flow velocity, water depth, substrate type, bottom topography, and sea -
sonal variability of water flows (Eerkes-Medrano et al. 2015). Factors that may have a temporal aspect include storms, floods, or anthropogenic activity. In estuaries, however, microplastic abundance has also received attention (Browne et al. 2010; Sadri and Thompson 2014; Zhao et al. 2014), but given the strong influence of salinity gradients and tidal movements in these sys -
tems, it remains difficult to understand local partition -
ing, the role played by the freshwater inputs and the degree to which estuaries may represent ‘hot-spots’ of accumulation. As rivers have shown to be a significant pathway of microplastics to the ocean, these relation -
ships are important to further understand source path -
ways and potential remediation that can be taken to avoid release of microplastics.GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  27
Figure 2.3 Potential sources of microplastics to the marine environment entering via rivers
Concentrations of microplastics reported for rivers 
(Table 2.4), are highly variable (up to a factor of 109; Dris 
et al. 2015), likely due to the different methodologies used but also because of converging currents, proxim -
ity to sources and the downstream location from cities. In addition each set of measurements represents a ‘snap-shot’ and the total flux of particles averaged over a representative time period is very difficult to estimate by measurements alone.
Lebreton et al. (2012) used an ocean circulation model 
coupled to a Lagangian particle-tracking model to sim -
ulate the input, transport and accumulation of marine debris over a 30-year period. A total of 9.6 million particles were released with inputs dependent on three proxies: coastal population density, impervious sur -
face layer and shipping density, using the data layers estimated by Halpern et al. (2008). A modelled particle release distribution from riverine inputs is compared to the surface water data (Table 2.3) in Figure 2.4 (when reported in particles per cubic metres and when using similar measuring methods from 333 μm to ~1 mm neuston net’s mesh size). The modelled riverine input represents urban development pressure on rivers. Best fit between measured microplastic particles in the sur -
face water per day and modelled particle release rate was found for y = 1.8207e
0.1135x (R2 = 0.75). Using this 
relation, we estimate a discharge of > 60 billion par -
ticles entering the ocean from rivers every day. Clearly, there is significant uncertainty in such estimates but they can be useful to indicate the relative importance of different sources and help to direct further research and possible mitigation measures.
While this assessment shows how proxies can be a 
useful tool in providing global estimates for a given input scenario, caution must be taken with this particu -
lar estimate as it is based on a handful of rivers (n =10), 
mainly in Europe and South America. Also, only surface water data was taken into account and suspended par -
ticles are therefore omitted. In that sense, this estimate is rather conservative. 28  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN

Coastline
Early estimates from the US National Academy 
of Science claim that a total of 5.8 million tonnes (6.4 million short tons) of waste are released into the ocean every year and of this 0.7 % is plastic, roughly 
41,000 metric tons (NAS 1975). A careful reading of this reference suggests that this number is based on an extrapolation of values from estimates of wastes produced by individual households. These inferences may not be entirely accurate. More recently, a study calculating the amount of mismanaged plastic waste generated by coastal populations worldwide estimated that 4.8 to 12.7 million tonnes can potentially enter the ocean as marine debris (Jambeck et al. 2015). A summary of common sources of macro- and micro -
plastics from coastlines is provided in Figure 2.5. An additional source that is regionally important is ship-breaking directly on the shoreline, such as in India and Bangladesh (Reddy et al. 2006).
The framework proposed by Jambeck et al. (2015) 
integrates data on solid waste, population density and economic status for 192 coastal countries. The annual amount of mismanaged plastic waste generated by populations living within 50 km of the coast was esti -
mated at 31.9 million metric tons per year. Mismanaged waste was defined as ‘material that is either littered or inadequately disposed. Inadequately disposed is not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not properly contained’ (Jambeck et al. 2015). It should be noted that informal waste picking appears to be included in the mismanaged waste category. However, waste picking forms an extremely important social and eco -
nomic role in India
7 (Sharholy et al. 2008) and parts of 
Asia and undoubtedly reduces the quantities of plastic from reaching the ocean. The study predicts an order of magnitude increase in marine littering from coastal population pressure by 2025 if no improvements are made on waste management infrastructure. The work also suggests that 83 % of the global mismanaged plas -
tic waste in coastal regions for 2010 was generated by 20 countries, a list dominated by Asian countries (11 countries in the top 20) with China ranking first (1.32 to 3.53 million metric tons of annual plastic debris input) and Indonesia second (0.48 to 1.29 million metric tons). An unquantified proportion of the plastic waste encountered in waste in countries in Asia and west Africa originates from more developed countries, espe -
cially in North America and western Europe. This is as a result of both the legal and illegal trade in packaging/construction plastics as well as plastics associated with electronics goods. 
It should be noted, however, that the estimate in 
Jambeck et al. (2015) relies on a conversion rate of 15% to 40 % from mismanaged plastic waste on land 
to potential plastic marine pollution. The conversion

rate is based on municipal water quality data from 
the San Francisco watershed in California. In order to refine global input estimates from coastal locations, the conversion rate from mismanaged plastic on land to floating marine debris should ideally take into account regional/local social and economic factors as well as site-specific coastal environment and contextual data such as land use, coastal morphology, shoreline sub -
strate, precipitation rates, wind, wave or tidal circula -
tion. It is for instance unknown from the initial estimate of total input to the ocean, what percentage is actu -
ally washing ashore soon after leaving land. There is a need for refining the general understanding of coastal dynamics for marine debris, particularly episodes of stranding and release. 
Extreme events such as storms, storm surges and 
tsunamis are also a significant immediate source of land-based plastic debris (Thiel and Haye 2006). A well-documented example is the pulse of debris washed into the North Pacific by the 2011 Tohoku tsunami (Lebreton and Borrero 2013; Maximenko and Hafner 2014).

Marine
Plastic litter originating from marine sources is gen -
erated from all types of boats, ships and offshore 
platforms by accidental loss, indiscriminate littering or illegal disposals (Allsopp et al. 2006). The occurrence of compounded plastics in the open ocean is most probably due to the routine solid waste disposals by individual ships (Colton et al. 1974). Fishing and aqua -
culture activities may also add large amounts of plas -
tics into the ocean. The recent increase in population along the coast globally and the accessibility of nylon netting, monofilament fragments for fishing and other purposes, have substantially become a cause of plastic litter generation (Bourne 1977). 
Numerical modelling assessment of marine debris 
dispersal originating from shipping activity is reviewed in Lebreton et al. (2012). The framework uses global shipping line frequency as a proxy for model particle release distribution (Figure 2.7). No numerical model -
ling studies investigating the contribution from fish-ing and aquaculture industries to the marine debris issue on a global scale have been proposed to date. Estimated distribution of fishing effort derived from catch statistics and fleets location (Watson et al. 2013) could be used for particle model source distribution. The study on global fishing effort shows that interna -
tional fleets now fish all of the world’s oceans and have increased in power by an average of 10-fold (25-fold for Asia) since the 1950s. In regard to fish and shellfish farming, however, while aquaculture and mariculture production for individual countries is well documented no quantitative or qualitative distribution of aquaculture activity on a global scale has been proposed to date.

Atmosphere
Atmospheric aerosol particles, defined as natural and 
anthropogenic solid or liquid droplets suspended in the atmosphere, may have sizes ranging from a few nanometres in diameter to several tens of micrometres (Pryor et al. 2015) and include primary anthropogenic aerosol particles derived principally from fuel com -
bustion and industrial processes, as well as synthetic fibres (Dris et al. 2015).
Since plastic fragments are transported by the wind, 
this must be also the case for microplastics, and atmo -
spheric inputs of microplastics cannot be ignored. In Lake Hovsgol, a remote mountain lake in Mongolia, an average density of 20,264 particles/km
2 (997 to 44,435 
particles/km2, min-max values) was observed (Free et 
al. 2014), indicating a significant contamination for a remote non-densely populated area attributed to aerial transfer from distant urban sources.
In a recent experiment (Dris et al. 2015, 2016), total 
atmospheric fallout (wet and dry) was collected through a funnel during a 3-month period, at various frequen -
cies, to better understand fluxes of microplastics to the watershed of the Seine river in Paris (France). Microplastics were observed with fibres being 90 % of 
the total number. Half of the fibres were longer than 1000 µm. Microplastic fallout ranged from 29 to 280 (average 118) particles/m
2/day. The lowest fallout was 
measured during dry periods and the highest fluxes were measured during periods of daily rainfall.Micro-particles in the ocean surface can be scavenged by bubbles and re-suspended in the atmosphere when the bubbles burst. This allows transport in the atmo -
sphere before being redeposited in the sea.
The atmosphere is an important pathway by which 
many natural and anthropogenic materials are trans -
ported from the continent to the ocean and also because of the low density of some polymers; fallout of plastic particles directly from the atmosphere or indirectly through rivers and watersheds seems to be far from negligible.

ost current models and estimates of litter quantities 
and distributions in the oceans consider continuous input of litter into the ocean and meso- to large-scale oceanographic models distributing plastic litter within the oceans. However, both entry and dispersal of litter in the oceans can be highly variable on temporal and spatial scales, which is important to keep in mind when evaluating ecological and economic risks and when designing preventative measures.GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  33
Figure 2.8  Potential sources of microplastics to the marine environment entering via the atmosphere
Plastic litter from many sources reaches the ocean 
on a near-continuous basis. For example, domestic and riverine litter can be considered chronic sources (Jambeck et al. 2015), similar to litter from shipping or fishing (see above). But, in many regions this is an over-simplification. Riverine flows are highly episodic even in temperate zones, varying over hours, days, seasonally and multi-year, and can deliver substantial quantities of litter to the ocean during high flow events (Moore et al. 2011; Carson et al. 2013; Rech et al. 2014, 2015). In tropical and sub-tropical regions, seasonal monsoons can flush out otherwise stagnant waterways. In subarc -
tic regions river flows will be highest during the spring thaw. However, there is limited information to quantify the impact of these variable inputs. During major epi -
sodic (catastrophic) events, such as large-scale river basin or coastal flooding, major storms (hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons) and tsunamis, very large amounts of litter may be delivered to the oceans in a short period (Thiel and Haye 2006). The recent 2011 tsunami in Japan is the first catastrophic event that has spurred systematic research efforts in quantifying and track -
ing plastic (and other) litter introduced to the oceans (Bagulayan et al. 2012; Lebreton and Borrero 2013; Calder et al. 2014). 
Currently, little information is available about the pro -
portions of plastic litter that enter the oceans via 
chronic and catastrophic sources. The frequency, quantification and impact of litter introduced to the oceans by these catastrophic events (flood events, cyclones, tsunamis) deserve more research attention. As a first step, it would be valuable to map regions in the world that are subject to catastrophic events (e.g. tsunamis along the Pacific Rim, cyclones at subtropical latitudes). 
2.5.2
 Regional scale dependency
I
t is important to realize that the quantities of macro- 
and microplastics entering the oceans from the sources 
described above may vary considerably from location to location. This may be due to the relative importance of different sectors, the adequacy of waste collection and management, and a whole series of environmental, social and economic factors. These differences persist despite increasing globalization of trade and movement of people.
For example, although coastal tourism is now a global 
phenomenon there are regions and countries where it represents a relatively larger contributor to the local economy and social welfare compared with other sec -
tors. This can result in an increase in both the pressure from marine litter and the local socio-economic impact. Such areas include SIDS and developing countries where a lack of adequate waste collection and man -
agement can exacerbate the problem. 
On smaller spatial scales, sources of microplastic can 
vary from country to country and even municipality to municipality. As industry footprints and waste manage -
ment differs, so will the amount and contributions of different types of microplastic litter. This means that efforts to mitigate microplastic waste entry into the 34  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANocean will need to be tailored to local circumstances, 
while recognizing that there will be commonalities in the types of waste being produced.
Seasonal environmental factors can affect both the 
generation of waste (e.g. seasonal fisheries, coastal tourism) and the transport of plastic to the ocean (sea -
sonal storms and flooding events). These variables also 
have a spatial element.

2.6.1  Conclusions
T
his chapter documents a series of studies assess -
ing the magnitude of microplastic contamination in 
the marine environment by identified source sectors. Evidence of the generation of primary or second -
ary microplastics has been reported at every level of a plastic product’s lifecycle, from both diffuse and point sources. Plastics enter the ocean via freshwater systems, wastewater run-offs and littering around the coastline, losses or discards at sea and atmospheric transport.
While source sectors can be identified, there is a con -
siderable lack of data quantifying the scale of the issue. 
Quantified results are reported for a relatively small number of case studies across sectors worldwide with highly varying methods and contexts. Accurately quan -
tifying the various sources of microplastics represents an important challenge for future research, as it would require internationally coordinated monitoring cam -
paigns on identified sectors. Understanding the vari -
ability of microplastics inputs into the ocean over space and time is an additional challenge. Unfortunately, methods of defining microplastics, sampling, and interpreting patterns in space or time vary consider -
ably among studies, yet if data could be synthesized across studies, a global picture of the problem may be available (see Chapter 7). A thorough mapping effort quantifying the loss of macro- and microplastics would help in predicting source estimates at regional or global scale and would assist in implementing policies and regulations. Models are very useful at augment -
ing gaps in observations and in running scenarios, although at some stage they need to be validated and tested against observations. Further model develop -
ment would be helpful.
2.6.2
 Knowledge gaps
O
n land, despite several identified sources of micro -
plastics in the construction sector, there are no pub -
lished studies estimating microplastics generation 
from construction sites. In agriculture, no estimates are available on the potential of CRFs to contribute to microplastics contamination in the ocean. More detailed studies are required to calculate emissions from terrestrial transportation to the sea. There are very few large-scale programmes measuring occurrence of debris around coastline and most peer-reviewed scien -
tific studies describe local patterns.
At sea, studies on the environmental impact of mari -
culture activities largely focus on eutrophication effects and dissolved contaminants and rarely examine the 
types and quantities of lost culture gear. No quantita -
tive estimates of plastic input from fishing and maricul -
ture are available even though locally these inputs can be substantial. 
Reliable data on concentrations, fluxes and polymer 
types in continental aquatic environments, including urban water systems, are still needed as freshwater ecosystems have received far less attention despite the majority of plastic litter being produced onshore and introduced into marine environments by rivers. This needs to include the total load and not simply that floating on the surface.
Currently, little information is available about the pro -
portions of plastic litter that enter the oceans via chronic 
and catastrophic sources, in particular quantitative estimates about catastrophic events are lacking.
There is a need to further improve the availability 
and reliability of models to cover various aspects of sources, transport, fate and effects.
A thorough analysis of the informal waste management 
activities in developing countries to mitigate plastic needs to be assessed in order to refine estimates of plastic waste leaving shorelines globally. The industry of waste picking, an informal form of waste manage -
ment, is capable of removing a significant volume of mismanaged plastic from the ground before it enters the ocean. Waste picking activities also transfer, by burning or informal dumping, valueless plastics into the environment. 
The behaviour of micro and nanoplastics in sea-
water and the pathway to sedimentation needs further  
analysis, in terms of buoyancy relative to sea state, biofouling and transportation during vertical descent.

3.1 L essons from the first assessment 
The first report identified key components about the complex plastics issue that are needed to make an accurate assessment of the transport, distribution and fate of microplastics in the ocean. The report also identified the need to identify ‘hot-spots’ for micro -
plastics in the ocean and the complex nature of such assessments. These complexities are due to several factors. As an example, it is thought that microplastics are present throughout the ocean and are distributed both horizontally and vertically in the water column. Thus, it is very difficult (and may not be possible) to detect the full size spectra of microplastics in situ on a large scale, and thus there are very few direct measure -
ments. The first GESAMP report highlighted the utility of numerical modelling as a tool to predict (or hindcast) the location of microplastics given an estimated source (or observed final location). There are several issues regarding modelling approaches which need to be considered, including uncertainties around the age of plastics (how long they are in the water column vs. on shore, for example), how particles change density while being transported by ocean currents, how plastic degrades over time (primary vs. secondary sources), unknown rates of biological transportation, coupling coastal and open ocean hydrodynamics, and integrat -
ing 3D circulation (the plastic loop) with temporary and permanent deposits (e.g. sedimentation and re-suspension). However, numerical modelling to predict and hindcast microplastics is a valuable tool which has strong merit. 
In this chapter, we describe further information regard -
ing such topics through discussion of the different 
compartments in the ocean where there is contami -
nation from microplastics and the transport and flux between compartments.
3.2 M icroplastics in ocean 
compartments
3.2.1  Compartments in brief
M
icroplastics are distributed between five main ocean 
compartments: i) on or near the ocean surface (includ -
ing the upper layers mixed by wave action); ii) in the 
water column; iii) on the seafloor; iv) on the shoreline, including buried in intertidal sediments; and, v) in biota (Figure 3.1). In addition, microplastics may be found in the atmosphere-ocean interface. Microplastics are transferred both between and within these compart -
ments, although the processes involved are poorly understood. The physical, chemical and biological processes acting on the microplastics within each res -
ervoir will differ. Consequently, the risks and opportuni -
ties for mitigation might also be different. 
With the exception of perhaps the surface ocean, there 
is a severe paucity in data on the amount of plastic in each compartment, and there is even less known about the fluxes of microplastic between compartments. Closing the global microplastic budget will require large-scale, targeted sampling and modelling of all of the compartments.
3.2.2
 Microplastics on the ocean surface
O
f the compartments, the surface ocean is prob -
ably the best sampled (see tables 10.1 and 10.3 of 
Lusher,  2015). Decades of extensive trawling data (Law et al. 2010, 2014; Cózar et al. 2014; Eriksen et al.  2013,  2014) have recently been combined into a global data set of more than 11,000 trawls (van Sebille et al.  2015). While coverage of this data set is still strongly biased towards some regions such as the North Pacific and North Atlantic, this data set reveals clear patterns of microplastic abundance. These stud -
ies, while different in their approaches, all come to a global estimate of the microplastic abundance of anywhere between 5  and 50  trillion particles, at a mass of 32,000 to 236,000 metric tonnes (van Sebille et al. 2015). Microplastics have also been observed in some of the most remote marine environments, includ -
ing surface waters of the Arctic (Lusher et al. 2015), Arctic sea ice (Obbard et al. 2014) and in the Southern Ocean (Barnes et al. 2010).
Approximately half of the floating microplastic in the 
open ocean resides in the subtropical gyres of the North and South Atlantic, North and South Pacific and the Indian Ocean, where abundances can be a million times higher than in other regions such as the tropical Pacific and Southern Oceans. High concentrations of microplastics are also found in some areas of highly populated marginal seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, which is characterized by an anti-estuarine circu -
lation (Cózar et al. 2014). First order, physical oceano -
graphic understanding, including Ekman theory, can GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  37
explain these patterns (see Section 3.3) with micro -
plastic accumulating in areas where large-scale winds 
cause convergence of the surface flow (van Sebille et al. 2015). After some time in the gyres, particles may be exported (or lost) to other oceanic or coastal areas (Majer et al. 2012) or sink due to physical degradation of larger items of floating debris and biofouling. It is very likely that the sea-surface micro-layer (upper 50 to 100  μm) has significantly higher concentrations of microplastic than the underlying layer (Song et al 2015). After sinking, microplastics may be re-dispersed by deep-sea currents to more remote waters and a pro -
portion may accumulate in the water column or on the ocean floor, depending on the settling rates of sedimenting particles. High concentrations of floating macroplastics occur on mid-ocean islands, partly as a result of direct wind forcing.

3.2.3
 Microplastics in the water column
I
t is less understood how much microplastics reside just 
below the ocean surface. Recent modelling (Kukulka et al. 2012) and observations with vertically stacked trawl nets (Reisser et al. 2015) show that, depending on sea state, a significant fraction of microplastics may be mixed down due to wave breaking and mixing in the upper few metres of the ocean surface. Since most ‘standard’ trawls only skim the top 10 cm of the ocean surface, they may miss a considerable fraction of microplastics, especially in rough seas. There may also be microplastics deeper in the water column, below the mixed layer. A proportion of this microplastic debris will be neutrally buoyant, a proportion may be settling to the seafloor and a proportion ascending towards the sea surface following the breakdown of organic or inorganic (e.g. calcium carbonate dissolution) binding substances. 
3.2.4
 Microplastics on the seafloor
S
ediments in the deep ocean are suggested to be a 
long-term sink for microplastics (Cózar et al. 2014; 
Eriksen et al. 2014; Woodall et al. 2014). Microplastics have been reported in marine sediments worldwide (Claessens et al. 2013; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Woodall et al. 2014) and the first report in subtidal sediments dates back to 2004 (Thompson et al. 2004). Deep sea sediments were demonstrated more recently to also accumulate microplastics (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Woodall et al. 2014) with composition that appears different from surface waters. Fibres were found at up to four orders of magnitude more abun -dant in deep-sea sediments from the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean than in contami -
nated sea surface waters (Woodall et al. 2014). 
Estimating the accumulation of microplastics in sur -
face sediments requires a better understanding of 
biogeochemical and physical processes that affect sinking and accumulation, particularly to identify prob -
able areas of accumulation. In the Lagoon of Venice for example, Vianello et al. (2013) detected the lowest microplastic concentrations where water currents are higher (outer lagoon, > 1 m s
-1) when the inner lagoon, 
which is characterized by lower hydrodynamics, had a higher fine particle ( <63 mm) fraction in the sediment. 
On the deep sea floor, circulation is not well explained and pathways are different from surface circulation. Submarine topographic features may also favour sedi -
mentation and increase the retention of microplastics at particular locations such as canyons and seeps or smaller scale structures (e.g. holes, rocks, geological barriers). As for larger debris, human activities may also affect composition and repartition, as shown with the high densities of microplastics found in harbour sediments (up to 391 microplastics/kg of dry sediment; Claessens et al., 2011). Similarly, in Slovenia (Laglbauer et al. 2014), between 3 and 87 particles per 100g were found, with coastal areas more affected. 38  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN Table 3.1 Abundance of microplastics in sediments worldwide.

3.2.5  Shor eline/Coastal regions
Although the total amount of microplastics on coast -
lines is not known, there are examples of studies 
quantifying microplastics at local and regional scales. Coastal studies have been carried out in many places across the globe, including Japan (Kako et al. 2010), Hawaii (Carson et al. 2011; Ribic et al. 2012; Agustin et al. 2015), South Africa (Madzena et al. 1997), Brazil (Santos et al. 2009), Australia (Hardesty et al. 2014), and Portugal (Antunes et al. 2013). An extensive sum -
mary of plastic studies along coastlines of the Pacific and Atlantic is given in tables 10.2 and 10.4 of Lusher et al. (2015).
Plastic on beaches is the most recognized form of vis -
ible marine plastic, and therefore attracts great atten -
tion from the general public. Still, it is not clear what the 
ecological impact of plastic on coastlines is. Although microplastics are hard to readily observe in sand, there are relevant studies showing microplastics on beaches and even a study on the significant amount of plastic buried on a beach in Brazil (Turra et al. 2014). 
It is also important to realize that there are coast -
lines other than beaches, and that these can retain 
microplastics too. Again, there is very little large-scale data about the distribution of microplastics on non-beach coastlines, although mangroves, for example, are thought to retain large amounts of plastic litter (Debrot et al. 2013).
3.2.6
 
Biota
Several studies have reported the ingestion of micro -
plastics by marine organisms from the field (e.g. marine 
mammals, birds, fish, bivalves, polychaetes, and crus -
taceans; see Chapter 4, Figure 4.4) and laboratory experiments (fish, polychaetes, bivalves and plankton; see Chapter 4, Figure 4.4 ). Active ingestion (filter-feeding or confusion with prey) and ventilation are commonly deemed to be the main pathways for inges -
tion of microplastics by marine fauna. Thus, biota may represent an important sink and potential transport mechanism for microplastics.3.3 T ransport within compartments
3.3.1  Upper ocean
M
icroplastics floating on the surface of the ocean can 
be considered passive, to a first approximation, and subject to surface currents. However, the exact depth at which the microplastics reside has large impacts on its pathway, as the currents in the upper ocean vary quite significantly over the top 50 metres or so (in a spiral-like fashion called the Ekman spiral, where cur -
rents a few tens of metres deep can be in the opposite direction of those at the surface). The buoyancy of the microplastics and the amount of wind mixing and waves breaking make it very difficult to predict where plastic particles reside. In general, there appears to be an exponential decay of microplastics with depth (Kukulka et al. 2012, 2015; Reisser et al. 2015; Brunner et al. 2015).
Beyond vertical mixing, waves and wind also affect the 
horizontal transport of microplastics. Stokes drift within waves can be a significant factor in the pathway of plastic, especially in coastal regions. Wind forcing has an important role in transporting macroplastic debris that has some part of the debris above the water’s surface when floating in the ocean, but is less likely to affect microplastics. 
The properties of plastic objects and particles (size, 
density, shape etc.) may change as a result of physi -
cal, chemical and biological processes, which will influence their subsequent behaviour and distribution. Fragmentation is a physical and mechanical process; oxidation, mediated by solar UV radiation, breaks the chemical bonds and facilitates fragmentation. The same process also occurs in thermal oxidation. Polyolefins undergoing auto oxidation are believed to also undergo chain scission as a part of the propaga -
tion reaction step. Where it is facilitated by solar UV radiation it is reasonable to expect the fragmentation changes to be localized to a surface layer demarcated by the depth of penetration of the UV radiation, and therefore also dependent on biofouling.

Fragmentation does not change the density of poly -
mers but alters their sizes (and therefore the specific surface area), which largely affects the transport and distribution of the plastics. Higher ambient tempera -
tures on beaches, termed thermal loading, accelerate this fragmentation process relative to that for plastics in seawater. However, the rates of fragmentation or half-lives of plastics on beaches or in seawater surfaces are not known. The research literature has addressed the issue of comparative degradation rates on land and sea surface (as well as ocean sediment), but the investiga -
tions have solely focused on loss in mechanical prop -
erties that occur as a prelude to any fragmentation. A recent study showed that in the Mediterranean plastic debris are dominated by millimetre-sized fragments with higher proportion of large plastic objects than 40  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANthe microplastic fragments in oceanic gyres (Cózar et 
al.  2014). These observations may reflect the closer connection of the Mediterranean with pollution sources or the ‘closed system’ nature of the region. However, the upper Mediterranean Sea kinetics and rates of frag -
mentation are still unknown.
Finally, disintegration of plastics by interactions with 
at-sea vessels may be caused by the mechanical stresses encountered in collisions, grinding in propel -
lers, or from passage through circulation systems. Though expected to be a minor process compared to other disintegration mechanisms, such anthropogenic processes may be non-negligible, especially for poly -
styrene foam that may comprise as much as 90 % of 
litter floating in coastal zones (Hinojosa and Thiel 2011) and 18 % of microplastics in the Mediterranean Sea 
(Collignon et al. 2012).
The transport of plastic on the surface of the ocean 
can also drive the dispersal of marine organisms. From microbes to invertebrates, many organisms have always attached to natural floating substrates (macro-algae, feathers, wood and pumice) and one might therefore ask why we should be concerned about plas -
tic transporting organisms? One important difference is the longevity of plastic relative to most of the natural substrates, allowing more mature communities to form and persist, perhaps even breed, and thus transport viable populations further. The distribution of plastic is different from that of natural substrates, and plastic has substantially increased the available substrate in oligotrophic open ocean regions, potentially alter -
ing the distributions of marine organisms (Goldstein et al.  2012; Majer et al. 2012), including the Southern Ocean (Barnes et al. 2003). Also, considering the vol -
ume of floating debris that leaves coastlines following catastrophic events, there is a concern that popula -
tions of organisms, as opposed to individuals, may survive the long journey from one continent to another.
3.3.2
 W
ater column
Plastics with a density that exceeds that of seawa -
ter (Table 3.2; > 1.02 kg/dm3) will eventually sink and 
accumulate in the sediment, while lower-density par -
ticles tend to float on the sea surface or in the water 
column. It has been suggested that even low-density plastics can reach the seafloor. Biofouling can lead to an increase in density resulting in the sinking of micro -
plastics (Andrady 2011). Indeed, analysis of polyethyl -
ene bags submerged in seawater showed a significant increase in biofilm formation over time, accompanied by corresponding changes in physicochemical prop -
erties of the plastic, such as a decrease in buoyancy (Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010; Lobelle and Cunliffe 2011). These studies suggest that biofouling can contribute to the sinking and eventual burial in sediments of previ -
ously buoyant plastic. Thus, biomass accumulation on plastic may help to partly explain the reported dis -
crepancy between observed concentrations of float -
ing microplastics in the open ocean and that quantity estimated as having been introduced into the marine environment (Cózar et al. 2014; Eriksen et al. 2014; van Sebille et al. 2015), but the extent of this effect has not been quantified. In addition, aggregation with organic matter (i.e. as faecal pellets or marine snow) has been suggested as a route of transport for microplastics to deep-sea sediments (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013b). 
Although the kinetics of fragmentation and the particle 
size spectrum that results remain unknown for even the most commonly used plastics at sea, many processes in the marine environment that cause disintegration have been identified. The mechanical energy required for disintegration may come from physical, biological or anthropogenic processes. The wind, sand and wave action at the sea surface, on sea floor or on beaches abrade or alter weakened plastics. Some animals also reduce object size by biting or chewing materials and marks from large fishes, including sharks, or birds have been reported, especially on polystyrene debris (Cadée  2002; Carson 2013). Grinding ingested plas -
tics may also reduce the size of plastic marine debris, altering hundreds of tons annually for tube-nosed seabirds only (van Franeker et al. 2011) and even minor disintegration in fish stomachs could represent a non-negligible contribution to particle fragmentation. 
3.3.3
 Deep ocean
M
echanisms influencing the distribution of micro -
plastics on the sea floor are not well understood. 
Microplastics are more likely to be influenced by advection than larger items and, more generally, circu -
lation patterns at all ocean levels (Woodall et al. 2014). Ocean dynamics could then explain the accumula -
tion of plastics in the deep sea or shallower waters depending on size and density. Recently, Ryan (2015) suggested that small items should start sinking sooner than large items because it requires less biofouling to make them negatively buoyant. 
Deep ocean currents are extremely enigmatic, and it 
is not clear at all whether there are circulation patterns near the ocean floor that could create hot-spots. It could be hypothesized that microplastics would accu -
mulate in deep canyons, as material might over time be slowly drawn down by a combination of turbulence and gravity. However, there is little empirical evidence for these accumulation patterns. In any case, we currently know so little of our ocean floor (our maps of the planet Mars are 25 times more accurate than those of the ocean floor) and mapping is so expensive that a global estimate of the amount of plastic in the deep ocean may be decades away.
Due to non-availability of light, lower temperatures, and 
lower oxygen levels at the ocean bottom, plastics there tend to accumulate close to their original form for long (as yet undetermined) periods of time. 
3.3.4
 
Coastlines
Microplastics on coastlines are influenced by a num -
ber of physical and chemical processes, including 
weathering degradation and transport by waves and wind. Transport is likely to be greatest during storms, and particles can be moved farther inshore by ballistic ‘jumps’. Furthermore, microplastics may get buried in the sand, either through naturally occurring beach ero -
sion and sedimentation, or through beach engineering work such as replenishment. Turra et al. (2014), for instance, found large amounts of microplastic pellets GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  41
deeper in the sand on a Brazilian beach, revealing that 
sandy beaches may act as permanent or temporary sinks for microplastics. There is some evidence that the presence of microplastics can alter the rate at which beach sands change temperature (Carson et al. 2011).
Coastlines may be a large sink of plastic, as plastic is 
deposited on shorelines. Regular shoreline clean-up activities can remove significant quantities of litter, though such activities typically remove larger debris items (Ocean Conservancy 2015), and are restricted to beach or coastal regions. The coastlines are argu -
ably the most convenient and cost-effective place to collect marine plastic litter, as no vessels are needed and working on land is typically easier than working on the ocean. However, there is a severe lack of globally standardized data on the amount of plastic removed from beaches in (volunteer-led or government-led) clean-ups, in particular for microplastics. This prevents a holistic large-scale understanding of spatial and tem -
poral trends. 
3.3.5
 
Biota
Biological processes (e.g. fouling, ingestion, aggre -
gation), and their interaction with the above physical 
processes, will influence how microplastics are trans -
ported within and between different ocean habitats. Properties of the microplastic particles themselves (e.g. type, density) will affect how they interact with these biological processes. For example, polypropyl -
ene is a common type of plastic used in rope and has a density of 0.9 g/cm
3 (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). It will 
therefore float in seawater (assuming an average sea -
water density of 1.02 g/cm3), which means that surface-
feeding pelagic organisms are more likely to ingest it. Heavier microplastics such as those composed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PET) are more likely to sink and therefore be ingested by benthic organisms. It’s also important to note that over time, low-density polymers may become fouled and sink (Morét-Ferguson et al. 2010; Long et al. 2015), in which case these lighter plastics may become available to benthic organisms. 
Phytoplankton communities can have impacts on 
microplastic distribution in the water column (Long et al. 2015 ). Depending on the ballasting properties and aggregation of phytoplankton communities, the removal and export of microplastic to the sea floor can be enhanced. In addition, within the food web, microal -
gae attached to microplastics are assumed to be more easily captured by filter feeders than free microplastics in the water column.
Some marine animals are indiscriminate feeders that 
will ingest anything in the appropriate size range. Others use visual, chemical and electrical cues for find -
ing and selecting food, so the probability of a piece of microplastic being ingested depends not only on size and encounter rate, but also on a number of other cues including shape, colour, smell and taste. The smell and taste of microplastic will be influenced by the microbial biofilm on the surface, and microbes colonize plastic in seawater very quickly; within a week most of the sur -
face is covered. This thin layer of living organic matter and by-products like extracellular polymeric substanc -
es (EPS) “slime” make the plastic smell and presumably taste like nutritious particles. This increases the likeli -
hood of ingestion by animals that use chemoreception to select food particles and thus impacts flux from the water to biota. Likelihood of ingestion and impact on the organism ingesting it will vary depending on the composition of microbial community including whether it includes potential pathogens. 
Another challenge is that the microbial community 
associated with microplastics also varies regionally and seasonally (Oberbeckmann et al. 2014), as well as on larger scales such as between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins (Amaral-Zettler et al. 2015). This variability suggests that risk management will have to vary regionally to be effective. 
3.4 F luxes between compartments
Equally important is understanding how microplas -
tics move between compartments, for example from the upper ocean to the deep sea sediments. These mechanisms include various physical (e.g. density), mechanical (e.g. waves and currents), chemical (e.g. oxidation) and biological (e.g. bio-transport and bio -
fouling) processes.
It remains an open question how microplastics leave 
the ocean surface. From this compartment, it can move to any of the other four compartments: to the water col -
umn and seafloor by sinking (most likely through den -
sity changes resulting from biofouling; Andrady 2011), to the shoreline by beaching or stranding (which may be event-driven as storms wash up large amounts of microplastics), and into biota through ingestion and aggregation in organic matrices. However, details of movement or transport between compartments is poorly understood. 
A number of oceanographic processes could aid in the 
transfer of microplastics to depth. As stated in Woodall et al. (2014), these processes include dense shelf water cascading, severe coastal storms, offshore convection and saline subduction. All these induce vertical and horizontal transfers of large volumes of particle loaded waters, including grains of various sizes and nature, as well as litter and contaminants, from shallow ocean layers and coastal regions to deeper ones. Submarine canyons act as preferential conduits for larger debris (Galgani et al. 1996; Pham et al. 2014). Lighter weight plastics may also find their way onto the seafloor if they pass through the gut of organisms and are released in faecal pellets or bound in other excretory materials (e.g. mucous). The incorporation of plastics into sediments provides an additional marker to the beginning of the Anthropocene (Zalasiewicz et al. 2015).
Microplastics reach coastlines by beaching, which in 
itself depends on the currents, sea state, wind, tides and coastal properties. It may very well be that beach -
ing is very intermittent, with low fluxes most of the time and then some large fluxes in short time windows associated with storms (Agustin et al. 2015). Even less is known about how much plastic is recaptured into the ocean from coastlines. 42  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN3.5 ‘ Hot-spots’ and scale-dependency
In this context, the term ‘hot-spots’ is used to help 
describe the heterogeneity observed in the distribu -
tion of marine plastic litter; i.e. there are locations of relatively high abundance. The use of the term should not be taken to imply an ecological or human health hazard (as may be the case when considering environ -
mental health guidelines), but to help focus attention and possible mitigation efforts. The mechanism by which ‘hot-spots’ form depends to a large degree on how plastic moves within and between the five different 
compartments. Understanding the ocean budget for  microplastics requires knowledge on both the inventory (stock) and movement (flux). Because it is much harder to measure fluxes than stock, this is an area where even less is known.
As discussed above, microplastics accumulate in 
open-ocean and coastal areas and can be vectors for pollutants and pathogens, imposing multiple stressors on marine biota. However, the risk of such impacts depends on the type, size and amount of plastic pres -
ent in the environment, the presence of contaminants in the region and contact with sensitive biota.
Figure 3.2 A map and a photo showing the different scales on which microplastics can accumulate. The map (left) is 
from van Sebille et al. (2015) and provides an estimate of the distribution of small ( <20 cm) floating plastics in the 
global ocean (numbers of particles km-2; colour scale – from red > 1x106 to blue < 1x100). The photo (right) shows 
pumice accumulating in a wind row (through NOAA Ocean Explorer) which could be representative for floating 
microplastics. Colours range from dark blue to yellow to red in order of increasing plastic accumulations
One of the difficulties in assessing the amount of plas -
tic in the ocean is that the distribution of microplastics tends to be ‘patchy’ (see Figure 3.2). On many different scales, from global (in accumulation zones), to regional to very local (e.g. Langmuir cells), the amount of plas -
tic can vary by orders of magnitude (Law et al. 2014). For example, wind rows (produced by the so-called Langmuir circulation, where waves and winds create a complicated surface circulation) can create very large density differences within metres. 
Models can aid in identifying hot-spots, especially if 
their ability to accurately simulate plastic behaviour and pathways improves. As hot-spots are areas where the density of microplastics are highest, models might find it easier to simulate these areas than their lower-density counterparts. 
The existence of hot-spots has implications for impacts 
and risk assessment (see Chapter 8), as well as for monitoring strategies (see also Chapter 7). On the other hand, the patchiness and existence of hot-spots can provide an opportunity for strategic and cost-effective intervention points.
In addition to the variability of plastic sources, sinks, 
pathways and movement on different temporal scales, there is also tremendous spatial variability. It is impor -
tant to consider source hot-spots and how these may be similar or different from accumulation hot-spots. On the global scale, surface plastic accumulates in subtropical gyres (Lebreton et al. 2012; Maximenko et al. 2012; van Sebille, 2015), demonstrating the hetero -geneity in accumulation of microplastics. Small-scale processes such as wave interactions, Langmuir circu -
lation and (sub) mesoscale eddies create a heteroge -
neous, patchy debris field on the surface of the ocean. Concentrations of floating plastic might therefore vary considerably on length scales of less than 100 m. There is relatively little known about the patchiness at such fine-scale resolution, even though patchiness is an important concept when interpreting surface trawl microplastics data. It is entirely conceivable that hit -
ting or missing a high-concentration patch with a trawl might impact the results of an observational study (Law et al. 2014). The patchiness in microplastic accumula-tion on the sea surface requires a less-patchy sampling effort, meaning more surface trawls over a wider area may smooth out the count and weight estimates that are sometimes compromised by random high or low accumulations.
On slightly larger scales (e.g. 100s of km), the con -
centrations of floating plastic are also heterogeneous. 
Local patches of down-welling creates accumula -
tion zones of a few tens of kilometres or less in size. Importantly, there are large knowledge gaps of where these mesoscale accumulation regions are located. While the model results from Maximenko et al. 2012, Lebreton et al. 2012, and van Sebille et al. 2014 agree roughly on the location of the large-scale open-ocean accumulation zones in the centres of the gyres, the three models place these meso-scale accu -
mulation zones at very different locations (van Sebille et al.  2015). These meso-scale accumulation zones GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  43
might hold a significant amount of floating plastic and, 
because they are often located much closer to shore -
lines and biologically productive regions, might have a disproportionately large impact on marine life (Wilcox et al. 2015).
3.6 C onclusions, knowledge gaps and 
research priorities
3.6.1  Conclusions
T
his chapter focuses on the distribution, fate and 
hot-spots for microplastics in the ocean. In general, 
microplastics in oceanic compartments are patchily distributed and movement and distribution is not well understood from empirical data. However, recent work is improving our knowledge in this area, though we are learning how microplastics reach coastlines and may be re-suspended. Microplastics move with currents, wave action, are likely lofted in windy conditions and are distributed throughout the water column. Because, however, there is little empirical information about the distribution of microplastics in most compartments, it is difficult to understand and identify microplastics hot-spots, as well as to quantify microplastic distribution and densities in space and time. Furthermore, because of these knowledge gaps, it can be challenging to make meaningful predictions about the relative transport and exchange of microplastics between compartments. However, lessons can be taken from recent model -
ling of ocean plastics movement and distribution, and applying lessons learned from recent work will improve our understanding here. 
3.6.2
 Knowledge gaps
T
here are currently much better data for plastics dis -
tribution of larger (meso, macro) plastic than currently 
exists for micro- and nanoplastics. This is due in part to difficulties in identifying and quantifying smaller parti -
cles, and is partly due to the vastness of the ocean and the difficulty in applying consistent, robust sampling techniques at scale. There are more comprehensive data available on larger plastics (and plastic fragments), particularly from land-based sources, than there are for microplastics in the ocean, as macroplastics have been systematically monitored in some regions for up to five decades. Systematic monitoring of microplastics, as distinct from opportunistic sampling on research cruises, is in its infancy. Making model predictions based upon best-available information can help to resolve some of these challenges and will enable us to better identify geographic target regions and compart -
ments to identify threats and risk posed by microplastic particles. 
How (and how much) microplastics leave the ocean 
surface remains an open question. We currently have little information on the quantities of primary, manufac -
tured microplastics entering our waterways as well as their fragmentation and breakdown rates. These know-ledge gaps necessarily restrict our understanding of the distribution, fate and hot-spots of microplastics in the marine environment, though there have been recent studies summarizing the state of knowledge of marine plastics in general. Applying the knowledge gained from this recent work will improve our understanding of the vertical distribution of microplastics in the ocean. 3.6.3

4.1 L essons from the first assessment
The GESAMP 2015 report demonstrated that a wide 
range of marine organisms across all trophic levels, including invertebrates, fish and seabirds, are contami -
nated with microplastics. In some cases, the incidence of ingestion is widespread across populations. Marine organisms are exposed to microplastics via feeding (including filtration, active grazing and deposit feeding) and transport across the gills (ventilation). The uptake, accumulation and elimination of microplastics by marine organisms depends on the size of the particle. The risk of associated impacts following exposure to microplastics depends on: i) the number of particles; ii) the type of particles (e.g. polymer type, size, shape and age; iii) the duration of exposure; iv) the concentrations and type of contaminants associated with the plastic; and, v) the physiology and life-history of the organism. 
The GESAMP 2015 report laid out the state of the 
evidence regarding the impacts of microplastics. It reported that microplastics can have toxic effects, including decreasing energy reserves, changes in feeding behaviour, movement, growth and breeding success. Moreover, small microplastics can cross cell membranes into cells and tissues and may cause particle toxicity (e.g. provoke an immune response with associated inflammation and cell damage). Furthermore, chemicals associated with microplastics can concentrate in tissues. This has been shown in animals during laboratory experiments. Still, there is little evidence from the field to demonstrate the extent that this occurs under natural conditions (and relative to other sources of anthropogenic chemicals to wildlife) and thus the relative importance of contaminant-expo -
sure mediated by microplastics as compared to other sources requires further research. 
Lastly, the 2015 report pointed out some areas where 
information regarding impacts from microplastics is lacking. The previous report points out that many of the demonstrated impacts have only been demonstrated in the laboratory, often at high exposure levels, for short time periods and without dose-response mea -
surements. Furthermore, there is concern about the potential of nano- and micro-sized plastic debris to translocate non-indigenous species, including patho -
genic organisms. As such, more ecologically relevant studies and additional observational experiments in nature are required because we still do not understand ecological- and ecosystem-level impacts of nano- and 
micro-sized plastic debris.This report aims to fill in some of the gaps pointed out in the last report by diving deeper into the existing evi -
dence and highlighting some of the new evidence since publication of the first report and through October of 2015. This chapter, in particular, reviews some of our current understanding regarding how microplastic debris and its associated chemicals and microbiota impact wildlife. The contents of this chapter are orga -
nized to facilitate risk assessment by outlining what we know about the exposure and impacts of microplastic pollution. Specifically, this chapter first discusses exposure and impacts related to microplastic itself, followed by the impacts related to microplastic-associ -
ated chemicals. In addition, we discuss the burgeoning evidence regarding the exposure and impact of nano-sized plastics and the role of microplastic in transport -
ing microbiota.
4.2 O ccurrence of microplastics in biota
4.2.1  Microplastics in the marine environment
T
he spatial extent and quantity of microplastic particles 
in the marine environment are raising concern among environmental managers and policy-makers regarding impacts to ecosystems (Eriksen et al. 2014; Thompson et al. 2004). As a result of widespread contamination, a diverse array of wildlife is exposed to microplas -
tics. Contamination in the form of ingestion has been recorded in tens of thousands of individual organisms and over 100 species (Gall and Thompson 2015; Lusher et al. 2013, 2015). In some species, ingestion is report -
ed in over 80 % of sampled populations (e.g. Murray and 
Cowie 2011; Kühn et al. 2015), which may be an issue if the exposure causes an impact. The physical particle, the associated chemicals and/or associated pathogens can cause adverse effects and are discussed in more detail in this chapter. 
To assess the impacts of microplastic contamination 
in wildlife, it is important to know the level and nature of the exposure. Exposures will vary based upon many factors, including location, habitat type and life-history strategies. For example, animals that live in the accu -
mulation zones in subtropical gyres and feed from the surface are likely to be exposed to relatively large concentrations of microplastic fragments. The risk of an impact from exposure will likely depend on many GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  45
factors, including the concentration, type, size and/
or shape of microplastics as previously outlined in the GESAMP 2015 report. 
The quantity and frequency of occurrence help us 
understand the dose of microplastics to animals in nature. Microplastic debris has been reported in multi -
ple oceanic habitats globally. A recent study estimates that there are more than 5 trillion pieces of plastic particles ( >0.33 mm) floating in pelagic habitats glob -
ally (Eriksen et al. 2014), and other studies reveal the presence of microplastics in remote habitats such as on seamounts and coral reefs in the deep sea (Woodall et al. 2014). It is important to have an understanding of how much microplastics are in different types of habitat in the environment, and the types and shapes that are found. A variety of types and concentrations of microplastics have been reported in the environ -
ment. See Chapter 2 for more information regarding quantities and types in different habitats globally. This information can be used in risk assessment and to ensure scientists design ecologically relevant labora-tory experiments measuring the impact of microplas -
tics at realistic exposure scenarios and concentrations to organisms. 
4.2.2
 Exposur
e pathways and concentrations of 
microplastics in marine organisms
Globally, marine organisms across many trophic lev -
els interact with microplastics via a number of path -
ways (Figure 4.1). As a consequence, there are many 
mechanisms by which an organism can take up this material. Microplastics can adhere to the body (i.e. attached to external appendages; Cole et al. 2013) and/or be absorbed (i.e. taken up by the organisms into the body through cell membranes). Absorption of microplastics has been demonstrated in phyto -
plankton (Bhattacharya et al. 2010; Long et al. 2015). Alternatively, microplastics can be taken up across the gills through ventilation, which has been demonstrated in crabs (Watts et al. 2014). Lastly, organisms can ingest microplastics directly or indirectly. Direct inges -
tion has been demonstrated in over a hundred marine species (reviewed in Lusher 2015; see Section  4.2.4). Organisms can ingest microplastics as food, unin -
tentionally capturing it while feeding or intentionally choosing it and/or mistaking it for prey (Lusher 2015). Organisms may also indirectly ingest plastic while ingesting prey containing microplastic, i.e. trophic transfer (e.g. Farrell and Nelson 2013). 
To assess our understanding of how microplastics 
may be impacting wildlife, it is important to under -
stand exposure pathways and concentrations used in laboratory experiments in comparison to those found in the environment. The following section reviews existing evidence from laboratory studies and obser -
vational studies in nature published up to the first quarter of 2016. Laboratory studies allow us to better understand mechanisms of uptake and consequential effects. They provide thresholds for toxicity and can inform risk assessment. In turn, knowing the concen -
trations of microplastic in wildlife also informs risk assessment and future experiments that are more environmentally relevant. 4.2.3
  Laborator y studies
Historically, laboratory studies with microplastics were used to document ingestion rates and retention time of particles to understand feeding behaviour (Hart 1991; Ward et al. 1998; Bolton and Havenhand 1998; Greiller and Hammond 2006). More recently, scientists have used them to demonstrate uptake of microplastic debris (e.g. Thompson et al. 2004; Browne et al. 2008; Cole et al. 2013; Watts et al. 2014) and begin to learn about the impacts of microplastics (e.g. Browne et al.  2008; Teuten et al. 2009; Wright et al. 2013; Rochman et al. 2013a). To date, many laboratory stud -
ies have demonstrated that uptake of microplastics can occur in a range of species. 
Examples of laboratory studies examining uptake of 
microplastics in multiple different taxa are summarized below. This compilation of studies demonstrates the exposure scenarios (i.e. range of concentration levels, exposure duration and species used) for exposures. It also provides information regarding the type of uptake that occurred, where relevant. Although some studies also tested and demonstrated impact, these results are summarized in a later section.

The above studies help us understand what animals 
may be impacted by microplastics and the mecha -
nisms of uptake. It is noteworthy that many of these studies suffer from a lack of environmentally relevant concentrations and exposure scenarios making them less useful in understanding risks from current environ -
mental concentrations. Below, we describe concentra -
tions of microplastic that have been found in animals in the wild that we hope can inform future laboratory studies to measure impacts of microplastic as well as risk assessments. 
4.2.4
 Field studies
W
ith numerous studies demonstrating the widespread 
distribution of microplastics in the marine environment, 
researchers began looking for evidence of microplastic uptake by wildlife. To date, microplastics have been found in a diversity of organisms with different feeding strategies (e.g. suspension feeding, deposit feeding, fil -
ter feeding, grazing, scavenging and predation) and at different trophic levels (Gall and Thompson 2015). Most studies have focused on the identification of microplas -
tics in gut contents. 
When microplastics are found in an organism, it is gen -
erally assumed that the debris was ingested directly. 
There is potential for microplastics to transfer from prey to predator and move up the food chain. At pres -
ent, there is little evidence of this in natural systems. There are a few studies demonstrating trophic transfer of microplastics in laboratory settings (Cedervall et al. 2012; Farrell and Nelson 2013; Watts et al. 2014) and potential trophic transfer of microplastics in wild-caught animals (Eriksson and Burton 2003). Although research demonstrating the transfer of microplastics through the food web is limited, several species that represent key links for trophic transfer are known to ingest microplastics (e.g. small pelagic fish, cope -
pods) and thus trophic transfer, with the possibility for increasing concentrations of particles to be found in higher trophic-level organisms (i.e. biomagnification), is likely to occur. 
Although most of the existing studies have looked 
for microplastics inside the gut, microplastic may be exported into other parts of the body after ingestion or absorption via translocation. Browne et al. (2008) were the first to demonstrate that small microplastics have the potential to translocate from the digestive tract to the circulatory system of exposed mussels Mytilus edulis.  Within three days after exposure to small poly -
styrene microspheres (3 and 10µm; 40 particles.mL
-1), 
microplastics were detected within the haemolymph of the organisms and persisted there for over 48 days. Smaller particles seem to undergo translocation more readily than larger ones (Browne et al. 2008). As such, more research is necessary to look for microplastic in wildlife in different parts of the body in addition to the gut content. 
Examples of several of the studies demonstrating 
contamination of wildlife by microplastic debris are summarized below to demonstrate the presence and amount of microplastics in a range of wild-caught animals. One thing to note is that there is very limited information regarding retention time and excretion in an animal.

The above examples show that many marine organisms 
are interacting and consequently contaminated with microplastics. This raises concerns regarding physical and chemical impacts related to ecologically relevant amounts and types of microplastics in marine habitats. Physically, microplastics can perforate the gut, cause organisms to feel full or even translocate outside the gut and cause cellular damage (Browne et al. 2008; Gregory et al. 2009; von Moos et al. 2012). Chemically, microplastics may be a source of toxins to wildlife at levels that are harmful. The next section summarizes what we currently understand about impacts to marine organisms. 4.3 I mpacts of microplastics on marine 
organisms
4.3.1  Impacts and the level of biological  
organization
The science relevant to the impacts of microplastic 
debris in the marine environment is still in its infancy. While we have been measuring quantities and impacts of larger plastic debris for decades, we only began investigating the science of microplastics in depth over the last decade. As such, we are only beginning to understand impacts of microplastics on marine organ -
isms. 
For several environmental stressors, especially during 
the early stages of research, effects are only dem -
onstrated at lower levels of biological organization GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  53
(e.g.  molecular, cellular, organism; Underwood and 
Peterson 1988; Adams et al. 1989). For microplastic debris, this is the case in that the majority of current knowledge remains at these lower levels. Moreover, many examples of demonstrated impacts are from laboratory rather than field studies. Although eco -
logical impacts are generally considered those rel -
evant to higher levels of biological organization (e.g. populations, assemblages, species and ecosystems), understanding responses at lower levels of biological organization can provide insight into causal relation -
ships between stressors and their effects at ecological levels (Adams et al. 1989; Browne et al. 2015b). As such, they are relevant. Below, we include examples of impacts that have been demonstrated across several levels of biological organization from laboratory and field studies. This information, in addition to the expo -
sure pathways and concentrations of microplastics in various marine organisms above, can be useful for risk assessment and to help design ecologically relevant experiments measuring the impact of microplastic to organisms in the environment. 
4.3.2
 Impacts demonstrated in laborator
y 
experiments
As mentioned above the majority of evidence regard -
ing impacts of microplastics on marine organisms 
comes from laboratory studies. These studies have generally been on bivalves, crustaceans, annelids or fish with unrealistically high concentrations of micro -
plastics compared to the natural environment. Below, we summarize some of the experimental work that has been done for different taxa (Figure 4.3; see Appendix Table AIII.1 for more detailed information).
At the bottom of the food chain is the plankton. For 
phytoplankton, there have been a few studies that looked for impacts of microplastics. One study found that the exposure of phytoplankton to microplastic did not produce adverse effects (Long et al. 2015). Another study demonstrated that charged PS nano-sized  
plastics  (0.02 μm) can sorb to microalgae, inhibiting microalgal photosynthesis and consequently reducing population growth and chlorophyll concentrations in the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus  (Bhattachyra et 
al.  2010). Lastly, one study demonstrated that micro -
algal growth of Dunaliella tertiolecta  was negatively 
affected by uncharged polystyrene particles (0.05 μm), but only at high concentrations (250 mg/L), and the PS beads did not affect microalgal photosynthesis (Sjollema et al. 2016). For zooplankton, microplastic can adhere to external and internal body parts, includ -
ing the alimentary canal, furca and urosome, and swim -
ming legs of copepods (Cole et al. 2013). The copepod, Calanus helgolandicus,  ingested and egested micro -
plastics (20 µm in size; polystyrene; 75 particles per ml for 23 h) which caused effects on fecundity, survival and feeding (Cole et al. 2015). Lee et al. (2013) ran an experiment using polystyrene microbeads that were 0.05, 0.5 and 6 µm in diameter. They demonstrated mortality in copepods after exposure to 12.5 µg/mL and 1.25 µg/mL concentration of 0.05 µm size micro -
plastic. The study also demonstrated a decrease in fecundity for 0.5 and 6 µm PS beads at 25, 12.5 and 1.25 µg/mL.
For other invertebrate taxa, some experimental work 
has also been done. In echinoderms, a toxic effect on the embryonic development of the green sea urchin (Lytechinus variegatus)  was observed as a result 
of exposure to PE microplastic particles (Nobre et al. 2015). However, Kaposi et al. (2014) reported only a limited threat to the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla  using 
more environmentally relevant concentrations of micro -
plastic. For Annelids, some experimental work has been done with Arenicola marina,  an important prey 
source for many marine species due to its high lipid content. A. marina  selectively feeds in sediment and 
will ingest microplastic particles. Long-term chronic exposure to environmentally relevant levels of PS (400 to 1300  µm) resulted in a dose dependent reduction in feeding capacity (Besseling et al. 2013). Increased microplastic concentration in sediments (0.02 %, 0.2% 
and 2 %) significantly increased the metabolic rate of 
individuals. Bioturbation was also affected, smaller and fewer casts were produced by organisms with microplastic present in sediment (Green et al. 2016). Reduced feeding, weight loss and oxidative stress were also observed (Browne et al. 2013; Besseling et al. 2013). For crustacea, no negative effects have been observed, but translocation between tissues was dem -
onstrated. A 2-month exposure resulted in PS micro -
plastic (180 to 240 µm) in the gills stomach, and hepa -
topancreas of crabs ( Uca rapax; Brennecke et al. 2015)
A lot of the toxicological work has been done with molluscs. A number of lab experiments have been performed to assess the potential adverse effects of microplastic in Mytilus edulis  (see Appendix Table 
AIII.1). Wegner et al. (2012) demonstrated increased production of pseudofaeces and reduced filter-feeding activity after exposure to 30 nm polystyrene nano-sized plastic particles (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 g/L). In other studies using different sizes and concentrations of microplastic particles, no significant reduction in feed -
ing activity or decrease in energy budget were dem -
onstrated (Browne et al. 2008; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2015). Von Moos et al. (2012) observed significant effects from exposure to microplastic of a larger size range ( >0 to 80 µm; 2.5 g/L). The microplastic accu -
mulated in epithelial cells of the digestive system (more specifically the digestive tubules), where they induced a strong inflammatory response accompanied by notable histological changes after only 3 hours of exposure. With increasing exposure times, the measured biologi-cal effects became more severe.
For vertebrates, laboratory studies assessing effects 
have been conducted with different species of fish. de Sá et al. (2015) observed a significant decrease in the predatory performance of P. microps  (common goby) 
after exposure to microplastics. Oliviera et al.  (2013) fed 1 to 5 µm polyethylene microplastics to fish at concentrations of 18.4 and 184 µg/L and observed an increase in AChE activity. Cedervall et al. (2012) fed nano-sized polystyrene (1 to 100 nm; 0.01 % w/v) to fish 
and observed weight loss, changes in metabolic per -
formance and changes in feeding behaviour. Rochman et al. (2013a, 2014a) fed polyethylene microplastic (<0.5  mm) to Japanese medaka at 0.001 % w/v and 
observed changes in gene expression related to endo -
crine disruption and liver toxicity. 
Although limited, impacts from microplastics have been 
observed in the laboratory (Figure 4.3). The majority of published effects include sub-lethal responses of organisms to microplastics. Microplastics can reduce the health, feeding, growth and survival of organisms from lower trophic levels.54  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN

on microbial species (occupying the branches on the lower portion of the tree) and also illustrates that the largest field 
efforts to date have focused on bony fishes (Teleostei) and mussels (Mytiloida). Fish (Teleostei) field studies were too 
numerous and thus not shown to scale in the figure. Please refer to Figure 5.4 for an expanded view of field studies 
employing fishes including sharks and rays (not included on the tree). Likewise, bird field studies were not included 
in this figure but they were highlighted earlier in Figure 4.2
4.3.3
 Evidence from the field
C
ompared to evidence from laboratories, there is very 
little direct evidence for physical impacts of microplas -
tic in nature. More is understood about the impact of 
macroplastic debris on organisms than microplastic debris in the marine environment. The only study that we are aware of testing impacts from microplas -
tic specifically in nature showed that in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, the increasing population of Halobates sericeus,  a marine insect, was linked to 
the increasing concentrations of microplastics in the region (Goldstein et al. 2012). Future field research is thus imperative to truly understand impacts to wildlife. 
4.3.4
 Summar
y of taxa included in recent 
research
This section described several studies that have dem -
onstrated impacts from microplastics across a range 
of taxa and levels of biological organization. Below we highlight the taxa that have been included in new research, as well as how the evidence informs ecologi -
cal impacts from microplastic debris.56  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANDiversity of taxa studied
The majority of studies conducted in the laboratory 
are with molluscs, crustaceans (including copepods) and fish. This is likely due to ease of experimentation with these animals in a laboratory. For field studies, the taxa are more diverse and include many species of vertebrates and invertebrates. Moreover, the num -
ber of studies that measure interactions and impacts from microplastics with eukaryotic single-celled spe -
cies (microbial eukaryotes) are far fewer than those that have targeted multicellular species, regardless of size. Most of the laboratory studies targeting microbial eukaryotes targeted photosynthetic eukaryotes (chlo -
rophytes, haptophytes, photosynthetic dinoflagellates 
 (
formerly referred to as dinophytes), and diatoms) with 
the exception of a few studies that looked at particle ingestion by the dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina  and cili -
ates Strombidium sulcatum  and Tintinnopsis lobiancoi.  
As nano-sized particles continue to raise concerns with respect to environmental impacts, it will be important for research to begin focusing on a broader spectrum of the microbial members that constitute the majority of the biomass in the ocean and impact the microbial food web and base of the food web. No studies to date have looked at microbial ingestion of microplastic/nanoplas -
tics in the field.
Ecological impacts
It is clear from above that there remains little dem -
onstrated evidence regarding ecological impacts of 
microplastic debris. In this report, we did not have the capacity to systematically review the existing peer-reviewed literature so we discuss the results of a recent review that did, but for marine debris in general. To evaluate the weight of evidence regarding the eco -
logical impacts of marine debris (including both plastic and non-plastic debris), a recent study (Rochman et al.  2015b) systematically and critically reviewed rel -
evant literature regarding effects of microdebris (plastic and other) at several levels of biological organization, spanning the fields of medicine, biological oceanogra -
phy, conservation biology, toxicology and ecology, ask -
ing the question: What are the demonstrated impacts of microdebris including microplastics? For each study, they recorded the size classes of debris, the level of biological organization, whether an impact was demon -
strated and the nature of the impact. For many papers, impacts were discussed at multiple levels of biological organization and sizes of debris. Overall, the study found evidence of 175 demonstrated impacts from microdebris, 78 % of which were caused by microplas -
tic debris. In total, the study found numerous impacts at suborganismal levels, several at the organismal level demonstrating clear evidence that marine debris can be the cause of death in individual organisms and little at the ecological levels demonstrating that marine debris can alter assemblages. Thus, their findings do demonstrate impacts from microplastic debris, but mostly highlight the need for an improved understand -
ing of ecological impacts of microplastic before any clear general ecological conclusions could be reached. A large reason for this is because researchers are not designing experiments that truly measure ecological impacts from microplastic debris. In addition to physical impacts of the microplastic particles themselves, microplastic is associated with a complex mixture of chemicals that may transfer to an animal upon exposure. Many of these chemicals are considered as priority contaminants by governments because they are persistent, bioaccumulative and/or toxic (Rochman et al. 2013b). As such, it is important to also discuss impacts related to the mixture of chemi -
cals associated with microplastic debris. 
4.4 I mpact of plastic-related chemicals
4.4.1  Concentration of chemicals associated with  
microplastic in the environment
A complex mixture of chemicals is associated with 
microplastic debris. Chemicals in this mixture include those that are ingredients of plastic materials (e.g. monomers and additives), byproducts of manufactur -
ing (e.g. chemicals released during the combustion of the raw material petroleum) and/or chemical contami -
nants in the ocean that accumulate on plastic from sur -
rounding environmental media (e.g. persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metals in ambient water or air). Two recent non-targeted screening analyses looking at the chemicals associated with plastic debris, detected a total of 231 to 251 organic compounds on plastics, including hydrocarbons, UV-stabilizers, anti-oxidants, plasticizers, flame retardants, lubricants, intermediates and compounds for dyes and inks (Gauquie et al. 2015; Rani et al. 2015).
Since Carpenter et al. (1972) first reported PCB con -
tamination on polystyrene microplastics in the early 
1970s, there has been a series of studies monitor -
ing the mixture of chemicals in floating, beached or ingested plastic particles. The reported concentra -
tion ranges of target chemicals are summarized with other information in Table 4.1 (see Table for reference). These studies report concentrations of targeted chemi -
cals including persistent organic pollutants (POPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltri -
chloroethane (DDT), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (hexachlorocyclo -
hexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), chlor -
danes and mirex), brominated or fluorinated flame-retardants (polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclodecanes (HBCDs) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs)) and additive ingredients (bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP) and octylphenol (OP)). A few studies also targeted metals. The plastic particles analysed were generally pre-production resin pellets in the size range of 1 to 5 mm or plastic fragments with a size range of up to tens of millimetres. Most stud -
ies analysed polyethylene (PE) and (or) polypropylene (PP) plastics and a few studies analysed other types of plastics (Table 4.1).
The concentration of this mixture of chemicals in and 
on microplastic is governed by many factors, including whether the chemical was added during manufactur -
ing or sorbed from the environment, physicochemi -
cal properties of plastics and chemicals, the size of plastics, concentration in the surrounding water, and other environmental factors (e.g. pH, temperature). For example, a recent study compared concentrations GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  57
of PCBs and PBDEs in small (0.3 to 1 mm) and large 
(1 to 5 mm) microplastic from Tokyo Bay, Japan and the pelagic waters of the Pacific Ocean (H. Takada, unpublished results). PCB concentrations in smaller polyethylene microplastic from Tokyo Bay were on the order of hundreds of ng/g, while those in the open ocean were a few ng/g.   The concentration ranges and spatial patterns (i.e. urban coast >>  open ocean) 
were similar to those observed in previous International Pellet Watch (http://www.pelletwatch.org/). Moreover, no PBDE congener 209 (BDE-209) was detected in smaller sized microplastic in the open ocean, whereas BDE-209 was detected in this same size range from the estuary of Tokyo Bay. This suggests that the increase in surface area on smaller microplastic could facilitate the leaching and photodegradation of BDE-209 faster than in larger sized microplastic. Still, additive chemi -
cals (e.g. PBDEs and NP) have been found at large concentrations on some particles of plastic in pristine and open oceans, suggesting there may be a greater risk of plastic being a source of chemical additives (e.g. PBDEs, NP) in pristine and remote areas than the absorbed chemicals (e.g. PCBs, DDT). 
Ranges of concentrations found from various studies 
are listed below in Table 4.1. The concentration ranges provided can be used in risk assessment and to help design ecologically relevant laboratory experiments for measuring the chemical impact of microplastic to organisms. Note, congener-specific data can be extracted from the cited literature.

4.4.2  T ransfer of chemicals from microplastic to 
marine organisms
One question often asked by policy makers is whether 
or not these chemicals can transfer from plastic to marine organisms. This section describes the processes by which transfer may occur and the current state of the evidence through 2015 from laboratory, field and theo -
retical studies addressing bioaccumulation. Lastly, this section discusses the parameters we need to include to further understand plastics as a source of chemicals to the environment and some examples of how current information can be used to guide estimates of chemical transfer for risk assessment. Processes of transfer
There are several processes by which microplastics 
can act as a source of chemicals to marine organisms. It is important to note that here we are discussing more than via the ingestion of plastic. These chemicals may be transported directly via ingestion of plastic. They may also be transferred indirectly if chemicals leach from microplastics into water and are taken up by an organism via indirect bioaccumulation, also called bio -
concentration, or if a predator eats a prey item that is contaminated with plastic (Figure 4.5). 58  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN
Figure 4.5 Mechanisms for the bioaccumulation of chemicals from plastic debris. The diagram depicts different 
pathways for how chemicals may transfer from plastic to biota in aquatic habitats. Bioaccumulation may occur directly 
via ingestion of plastic (left) or indirectly via desorption of chemicals from plastic into other environmental media 
followed by bio-concentration from the water (middle) or trophic transfer via a prey item that is contaminated with 
plastic which may lead to biomagnification, i.e. increasing levels in predators (right). Note, this figure does not include 
the many other sources of industrial chemicals to wildlife and only shows how microplastic may contribute to the 
transfer of chemicals in aquatic systems
There is no doubt that these processes can occur, but 
there is uncertainty about the extent that they do occur 
in nature. There is a separate discussion regarding the 
“importance” of plastic as a source of chemicals to organisms, i.e. the relative contribution of microplastic as a source of chemicals compared to other sources such as surrounding water and/or prey. This discus -
sion is based on fugacity gradients, which according to first principles in environmental chemistry will drive the direction that the chemical moves, i.e. from plastic to animal or vice versa. The various matrices, including water, biota, sediment and plastic, will strive to reach equilibrium and thus chemicals in the environment will move in the direction toward equilibrium. Thus, you can imagine a piece of plastic, a fish and the water column that have been in the ocean for 1 year will be at or near equilibrium. Thus, if the fish ingests the plastic, the  PCBs may not transfer at all. In other words, the ocean is already contaminated with chemicals that come from a number of different sources. As such, animals can accumulate hazardous chemicals via several processes, including uptake from surround -
ing water, air or sediment and ingestion of particles in the water and/or their diet (Van der Oost et al. 2003). The introduction of microplastic to the ocean intro -
duces another potential source of additive chemicals and sorbed contaminants from the environment to wildlife (Farrington and Takada 2014). Thus, an animal exposed to microplastic is likely already contaminated with chemicals from other sources and the plastic may not act as a significant additional source of chemical  
contamination. 
Modelling studies are useful to conceptualize these 
ideas regarding how plastic may be an important source and sink for chemicals in the environment 
relevant to other media (e.g. diet, sediment, water). Published studies using such models conclude that whether plastic acts as a source of chemicals to ani -
mals via ingestion depends on the fugacity gradient between the chemical contaminant concentration in the plastic vs. in the lipid stores of the animal (Koelmans 2015; Koelmans et al. 2013). Thus, when an organism is relatively clean of contaminants, model studies (based upon fugacity gradients) predict that chemicals will transfer from the plastic into the lipid (Figure 4.6c). This may occur when microplastics in the ocean are not in equilibrium and have sporadically large concentrations of additives or sorbed contaminants. Alternatively, if an organism has a greater body burden of chemicals than the introduced plastic debris, the model studies predict (based on fugacity) that the plastic debris will “clean” the lipid (Figure 4.6a). This may occur if an organism in the ocean for example ingests a raw or relatively clean plastic pellet. Lastly, when an animal and plastic have a similar level of contamination, any change in con -
taminant levels between the organism and the plastic may be negligible in comparison to other sources (Figure  4.6b; Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans et al. 2013, 2014; Koelmans 2015). Thus, modelling exercises con -
clude that chemicals from plastic can transfer to ani -
mals upon ingestion or the other way around, depen -
dent on fugacity gradients, but generally the transfer is only measurable when (a) plastic is a larger source of chemicals than other media, and (b) there is sufficient fugacity gradient for transfer, and (c) the effect is larger than measurement error and biological variation (Gouin et al. 2011; Koelmans 2015). 
Figure 4.6  The figure above is a simplified depiction describing the scenarios discussed above. The image on the left 
(a) depicts a scenario where a contaminated fish eats a relatively clean piece of plastic and the chemical moves from 
the fish to the plastic. The image in the middle (b) depicts a scenario where a contaminated fish eats a contaminated 
piece of plastic and no transfer occurs. The image on the right (c) depicts a scenario where a relatively clean fish eats 
a contaminated piece of plastic and the chemicals transfer to the fishGESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  59
Evidence of transfer from the laboratory
Laboratory observations suggest that chemicals from 
plastic can transfer to aquatic animals. Such trends have been described in a number of species includ -
ing lugworms (Browne et al. 2013), amphipods (Chua et al.  2014) and fish (Rochman et al. 2013a). Some researchers have suggested that chemicals can trans -
fer from plastic to biota using simulated gastric condi -
tions (Bakir et al. 2014; Tanaka et al. 2015) and other studies have demonstrated transfer by exposing lab animals to plastic with different sorbed chemicals, including PBDEs, nonylphenol, phenanthrene and tri -
closan. 
Some studies measured plastic as a source of chemi -
cals relative to other media (i.e. water, sediment and/
or food). One study asked if microplastic particles mediated greater transfer of PBDEs to amphipods than seawater. Similar to what theory predicts, animals that were exposed to PBDEs in the presence of clean microplastics had a smaller body burden of PBDEs than those exposed to PBDEs dissolved in seawater alone (Chua et al. 2014). Similarly, a study measured the relative difference in bioaccumulation between sand and microplastic by exposing clean lugworms to microplastic or sand spiked with phenanthrene and nonylphenol. They found that lugworms exposed to chemicals via sand bioaccumulated > 250% more 
phenanthrene and nonylphenol than animals exposed to plastic (Browne et al. 2013).
Other studies aimed to measure the importance of 
plastic as a source of chemicals in the presence of a contaminated system (i.e. to try to better understand scenarios in nature). One study exposed contaminated amphipods to microplastic spiked with PBDEs (Chua et al. 2014). They found no significant difference between concentrations of PBDEs in animals exposed to clean plastics (i.e. the microplastics did not “clean” the organisms of PBDEs) versus those exposed to micro -
plastics with environmentally relevant levels of PBDEs, and an increase in PBDEs in amphipods exposed to microplastic with concentrations of PBDEs greater than their starting concentrations (Chua et al. 2013). In another study, fish that were already contaminated with PAHs, PCBs and PBDEs were exposed to plastic with environmentally relevant concentrations of the same chemicals and at concentrations of microplastic rele -
vant to what is found in the subtropical gyres. For PAHs and PCBs, significant transfer of chemicals to fish was not observed. In contrast, the transfer of PBDEs was significantly greater (Rochman et al. 2013a). Another study consisted of tanks with plastic, sediment and worms with concentrations of PCBs all at equilibrium (Besseling et al. 2013). Lugworms exposed to smaller concentrations of plastic had greater concentration of PCBs in their tissues, but lugworms exposed to larger amounts of plastic accumulated similar concentrations of PCBs as lugworms that were not exposed to plastic (Besseling et al. 2013). Differences in conclusions high -
light that further research is necessary to determine the importance of plastic debris as a source of chemicals in nature. Evidence of transfer in the natural environment
In nature, animals are exposed to chemical contami -
nation via multiple sources, and thus it is difficult to 
demonstrate that plastics are the source of bioaccu -
mulation in wildlife. Still, some researchers who have conducted observational experiments in nature have suggested that burdens of chemical contaminants in wildlife were introduced by plastic debris. Recent stud -
ies have looked for associations between plastic debris and bioaccumulation in whales (Fossi et al. 2012, 2014), basking sharks (Fossi et al. 2014), seabirds (Teuten et al. 2009; Tanaka et al. 2013; Lavers et al. 2014; Hardesty et al. 2015; Yamashita et al. 2011) and fish (Gassel et al. 2013; Rochman et al. 2014b). 
Some studies suggest that chemicals can transfer 
qualitatively from microplastics to animals in nature. These studies have simply noted the large presence of plastic debris in the feeding grounds of animals, the presence of plastic in their gut contents and/or plastic-associated chemicals in surrounding media, and the detection of plastic-associated chemicals in the animal of concern (Fossi et al. 2012, 2014; Hardesty et al. 2015 Gassel et al. 2013). Such studies include discussion of phthalates in fin whales (Fossi et al. 2012) and seabirds (Hardesty et al. 2015 and PBDEs in fish (Gassel et al. 2013) and seabirds (Tanaka et al. 2013). 
Other studies have aimed to quantitatively demon -
strate positive correlations between plastic debris 
and bioaccumulation of hazardous chemicals. Such results should be taken with caution, as correlation does not always mean causation, and there are many other sources in the environment that may also be correlated. Researchers have found that the concen -
trations of some PCBs (Teuten et al. 2009; Yamashita et al. 2011; Ryan et al. 1988) and trace metals (Lavers et al. 2014) in seabirds and higher-brominated PBDEs in fish (Rochman et al. 2014b) are positively correlated with plastic debris. It is worth nothing that the study examining fish could not find any significant correla -
tion between plastic debris and the bioaccumulation of bisphenol A, nonylphenols and PCBs (Rochman et al. 2014b).
Overall, it is clear that plastic can be a source and sink 
of chemicals to animals. What is less clear is the extent to which plastic is a source to wildlife in nature and how it is relevant to risk. As noted above, quantifying plastic as a source of chemicals for bioconcentration and bioaccumulation is difficult to isolate from other sources in nature. There are several parameters that will influence whether or not transfer of chemicals will occur to an extent that causes harm. Chemical transfer will be influenced by external factors such as plastic type, size and amount, concentration and properties (e.g. hydrophobicity, susceptibility to metabolism) of chemicals on the plastic and in the organism, ecology (especially trophic level) and physiology of the animal and the retention time in the animal. As such, it is important that we continue to investigate the issue. In parallel, we can use the existing information to estimate the transfer that we might expect in nature under differ -
ent scenarios to begin to think about risk.60  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANEstimating chemical transfer 
The estimation of chemical exposure to organisms 
from microplastics is useful in a risk assessment framework, but it is complex and thus requires several assumptions. Published models may be adopted as a framework to estimate chemical transfer (for example, see Koelmans et al. 2013). Values for each variable needed to solve the equations within these models can be gathered from the existing literature, including the studies that are discussed above (as in Koelmans et al. 2016). 
For example, most studies provide the range, mean 
and (or) median value of concentrations of chemicals found in plastic. Most studies also specify concentra -
tions of plastic in the environment and/or in animals which can be used to calculate the mass of ingested plastic. The rate that chemicals transfer from plastic to an animal after exposure to plastic in a laboratory can be calculated using these equations with this informa -
tion from previous laboratory studies. The receptor organisms can be chosen based on the objectives of the risk assessment. For example, assessments may include lugworms, bivalves (e.g. blue mussels), small fish (e.g. brown goby), large fish (e.g. Atlantic herring) and seabirds (e.g. northern fulmar). Each of these groups is known to ingest microplastics in nature and laboratory studies measuring transfer of chemicals have been conducted on similar organisms.
Such an exercise can be used to roughly estimate the 
exposure and resulting concentrations in wildlife under different scenarios. But note, as with all modelling exercises, that each will be based on several assump -
tions and some uncertainty. In nature, there are many factors that will influence the assimilation rate such as leaching, desorption and the partitioning of chemicals between the microplastic and the gut and tissue of organisms. In addition, the physicochemical properties of plastics and target chemicals, metabolic capacity of organisms, retention time of plastics, chemicals and organisms. 
4.4.3
 Impacts of chemicals from microplastics on
 
organisms in the laboratory
Discussions regarding microplastics as a source of 
hazardous chemicals to wildlife has raised concerns regarding adverse biological effects. While several studies have examined adverse health effects from the ingestion of clean microplastics, as discussed in the previous section, only a few laboratory studies have tested hypotheses regarding the impacts associ -
ated with the complex mixture of plastic and sorbed contaminants to organisms. One study found that the combination of PVC with sorbed triclosan altered feeding behaviour and caused mortality in lugworms (Browne et al. 2013). Another study demonstrated that polyethylene deployed in San Diego Bay, CA (i.e. allow -
ing the plastic to accumulate environmentally relevant concentrations of priority pollutants) caused hepatic stress, including glycogen depletion, lipidosis, cel-lular death and tumour development, in fish exposed to microplastic for a 2-month period (Rochman et al. 2013a). Moreover, fish exposed to the combination of polyethylene and priority pollutants showed signs of endocrine disruption via changes in gene expres -sion and abnormal growth of germ cells in the gonads (Rochman et al. 2014a). In both studies, adverse effects were demonstrated from the plastic alone, but organ -
isms suffered greater effects when exposed to the mixture of plastic with sorbed chemical contaminants (Browne et al. 2013; Rochman et al. 2013a), suggesting that the combination of plastic debris and priority pol -
lutants may be a multiple stressor in the environment. 
4.4.4
 
Conclusion
Plastic debris is associated with a cocktail of hazard -
ous chemicals, some unique to plastic debris as addi -
tives and monomers and others that are ubiquitous 
in nature from other sources. As such, plastic debris is often discussed as a source of chemical pollutants to the environment and potentially to wildlife, raising concerns regarding how plastic debris may impact the health of ecosystems. Several priority chemical pollut -
ants are associated with plastic debris. Such chemicals are designated a priority based upon their persistence, toxicity and their ability to biologically accumulate in organisms and magnify in foodwebs (Teuten et al. 2009; Rainbow 2007; Vallack et al. 1998). Ecotoxicological work has shown that priority pollutants can alter the structure and functions of ecosystems. Physiological processes of organisms (e.g. cell-division, immunity, hormonal regulation) can be disrupted, causing dis -
ease (e.g. cancer) (Zhuang et al. 2009; Vasseur and Cossu-Leguille 2006; Oehlmann et al. 2009), reducing the ability to escape predation (Cartwright et al. 2006) and altering reproductive success (Brown et al. 2004). Furthermore, priority pollutants can alter interactions among species (e.g. competition; Roberts et al. 2008), which may lead to structural (Roberts et al. 2008) and genetic (Pease et al. 2010) changes in biodiversity (Johnston and Roberts 2009). Thus, further research is needed to understand the extent that plastic debris is a source of chemicals to the marine environment and any ecological hazards that may be associated. 
4.5 N ano-sized plastic debris
4.5.1  Definitions
L
ittle research has been done looking at the effects of 
nano-sized microplastics on marine organisms. Our knowledge and understanding is limited to short-term laboratory studies of fish and invertebrate species exposed to high concentrations (GESAMP 2015). In fact, several of the demonstrated impacts in laboratory exposures displayed above were due to nano-sized plastic (see Annex Table AIII.1). In addition, there is a greater body of research measuring effects of nano-sized plastic debris on animals and even humans from the fields of nanotechnology and medical sciences (summarized in GESAMP report 2015). Parallels may apply between the fields of engineered (non-polymeric) nanoparticles (ENP) and nano-sized plastic where particle characteristics (size, surface charge, density, composition, shape, etc) largely affect toxicity. This section first defines nano-sized plastics and its differ -
ent properties and then summarizes some of the recent findings on the fate and effects of nano-sized plastic on humans and marine organisms.GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  61
The definition of nanoplastics is ambiguous and a clear 
definition of what should be named a “nanoplastic” has not yet been established (Koelmans et al. 2015; Mattsson et al. 2015). In the scientific literature at least two different definitions of nanoplastics have been adopted: i) Nano-sized plastic particles < 1000 nm (e.g. 
Browne et al. 2007; Andrady 2011; Cole et al. 2011); and  ii) Nanoplastics < 100 nm (in at least one of its 
dimensions) as defined for non-polymer nanomateri -
als in the field of engineered nanoparticles (ENP) (e.g. Koelmans et al. 2015; Bergami et al. 2015). Nano-sized plastic (also termed nanoplastic) falls within the defini -
tion of microplastic adopted by GESAMP (2015) and according to our definition comprise all polymeric par -
ticles  <1000 nm (in at least one of its dimensions). They 
include the synthetic nano-sized plastic with a polymer core and variable functional groups and the polymeric ENPs based on nanotechnology that might exhibit additional properties including non-polymeric nano-scale additives. Therefore, special reference should be made to polymeric ENPs (by definition < 100 nm) 
as they represent a unique group with different prop -
erties. In general, nano-sized plastics are potentially more hazardous than micro-sized plastics (Koelmans et al. 2015; Bergami et al. 2015; Mattsson et al. 2015; Della Torre et al. 2014) and their uptake and toxicity will depend on their intrinsic properties such as size and surface charges, that affect their interrelationships and their interaction with exposure media (Bergami et al. 2015). In the case of polymeric ENPs, release of non-polymeric nano-scale additives from the prod -
uct fragments, as a consequence of possible nano-fragmentation, may further add to the overall hazard (Koelmans et al. 2015).
4.5.2
 Evidence of nano-sized plastic debris in the
 
environment
Due to limitations in methodology (see Chapter 7), con -
centrations of nano-sized microplastic in the environ -
ment are unknown. Moreover, they tend to flocculate 
based on their properties, and thus it is difficult to quantify individual particles. This issue is the same for ENPs. However, due to the fate of larger microplastics, we are relatively certain of their presence in marine habitats. Still, without an understanding of the amount in the environment, it is difficult to identify an envi -
ronmentally relevant dose for experimentation or risk assessment. 
4.5.3
 Potential fate and impacts of nano-sized
 
plastic to humans and other biota
A number of studies have demonstrated that nanopar -
ticle toxicity is extremely complex and that the biologi -
cal activity of nanoparticles will depend on a variety of 
physicochemical properties such as particle size, shape, agglomeration state, crystal structure, chemical composition, surface area and surface properties (e.g. Hofmann-Amtenbrink et al. 2015). Particle character -
izations can affect the likelihood of sorption properties, uptake and effects. For aquatic behaviour of nanoma -
terials such as polymeric ENPs, homo- and hetero-aggregation are important processes to consider (see Koelmans et al. 2015). Particle aggregation leads to a reduced surface area to volume ratio and new surface structures (Mattsson et al. 2015). Photooxidation and photoreduction affect coatings, oxidation state, gen -
eration of oxygen species and persistence. Particles may interact with natural organic materials such as proteins, forming ‘bi-molecular corona’ that may affect the behaviour of the material, including surface charge, aggregation state and reactivity, thereby affecting transport, bioavailability and toxicity (for review see Mattsson et al. 2015).
Nano research has documented that ENPs primarily 
are transported over the cell membrane via endocy -
tosis, and thus may serve as a cellular-vector (Trojan horse) for other chemicals or nano-additives (carbon materials and metal ions) (see GESAMP 2015; Mattsson et al. 2015; Galloway 2015). There is evidence that similar effects can occur with the nano-sized plastic in marine organisms. The capability of marine organ -
isms to translocate assimilated small plastic particles within their tissues has been demonstrated (von Moos et al.  2012). These authors exposed blue mussel to HDPE powder in a size range of > 0 to 80 μm and dem -
onstrated intracellular uptake of microplastic particles into the cells of digestive tubules and transition into cell organelles of the lysosomal system. However, it remains unclear whether the “Trojan horse” mechanism can work for chemicals associated with nano-sized microplastics, and the resulting chemical effects from translocated particles into cells and tissues will require further research.
It is plausible that under environmental conditions this 
defence mechanism would deliver plastic particle-associated POPs and additive chemicals to different tissue types and locations than those resulting from uptake from food and water. Given the long residence time of such sequestered particles relative to the life -
time of the organism, even slow chemical release may cause low but chronic delivery within the animal (see GESAMP report, 2015). This unstudied vector effect may provide a unique process to deliver chemicals to specific organs, especially for very small plastic particles that can cross membranes, and should be an important focus for future studies (see also Syberg et al. 2015; GESAMP 2015; Koelmans et al. 2015). Nano-sized plastics exhibit strong sorption affinities for toxic compounds (Velzeboer et al. 2014; Mattsson et al. 2015). 
Effects of nano-sized plastic particles on a variety of 
marine organisms have been demonstrated in labo -
ratory experiments (see elsewhere in this report and GESAMP 2015). Several of these studies have shown that uptake and toxicity depend on the intrinsic proper -
ties of the particles, such as size and surface charges that affect their interaction with exposure media (Della Torre et al. 2014). In addition, a number of recent stud -
ies have demonstrated effects of PS nanoparticles on feeding, behaviour and physiology of early life stages, such as brine shrimp (Bergami et al. 2015) and sea urchins (Della Torre et al. 2014; Canesi et al. 2015). The study of Bergami et al. (2015) is highlighted below. These authors studied the effects of 40 nm anionic car -
boxylated (PS-COOH; negatively charged) and 50 nm cationic amino (PS-NH2; positively charged) polysty -
rene nanoparticles (PS NPs) on brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana)  larvae. PS-COOH NPs were massively 
sequestered inside the gut lumen and this likely limited 62  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANfood intake. Likewise, PS-NH2 (5-100µg/ml) accumu -
lated in larvae (48h) but also adsorbed at the surface 
of sensorial antennules and appendages probably hampering larval motility. This study demonstrates the bioavailability of nano-sized PS for planktonic species and also that surface charge of the particles might play a significant role in determining the ultimate effect.
ENP based research showed that nanoparticle interac -
tions with biological systems can stimulate inflamma -
tory or allergic reactions and activate the complement 
system. Nanoparticles can also stimulate immune response by acting as adjuvants or as haptens, and cause immunosuppressive effects (Kononenko et al. 2015). Recently, similar immunological effects have been reported for micro- and nanoplastics interactions with marine invertebrates (Avio et al. 2015; Canesi et al.  2015). The latter study investigated the in vitro effects of PS-NH2 in hemocytes of the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis)  and demonstrated that in mussels the 
immune function can represent a significant target for  PS-NPs. In Mytilus hemocytes,  PS-NH2 affected 
several immune parameters and induced pre-apoptotic processes (Canesi et al. 2015).
The above studies illustrate the potential of nanoplas -
tics to affect plankton and early life stages, to decrease 
biological fitness (through immunosuppression) and reproductive and predator avoidance behaviours, with potential consequences at the population level or food webs over time. However, nano-sized plastic exposure levels and associated effects in the field are currently unknown and the laboratory results based on short-term and high exposure concentrations, hampering extrapolation of these findings to the field situation. The potential impacts of micro- and nanoplastics on human health are described in Chapter 5.4. 
As described above, environmental nanoplastics are 
in fact complex cocktails of contaminants that can act via different modes of action and thus require a multi-stressor risk assessment approach. For example cumulative particle and chemical toxicity effects may occur once NPs have been internalized into tissues and cells. Since all plastics in the marine environment contain multiple potential chemical toxicants, individual and combination effects of the chemicals should be accounted for. Our knowledge on the ecotoxicity and fate of nano and microplastic can benefit from the more advanced areas of (eco) toxicology of ENP and mixture toxicity (Syberg et al. 2015), and a comparison between the two fields should be further encouraged, for example comparing the effects in target species of microplastics in the nano-sized range with those of  ENPs. For more information the reader is referred to the reviews by Koelmans et al. 2015; Mattsson et al. 2015 and Syberg et al. 2015.
4.6 T ransport of non-indigenous 
species
4.6.1  Processes
F
inally, microplastic debris hosts diverse assemblages 
of species, some distinct from surrounding seawater 
(Table AIII.4; Zettler et al. 2013), through the creation of novel habitat which may drift long distances and pose an ecological impact via transport of non-native  species (Barnes et al. 2005). 
The availability of microplastics for settlement has 
become an important issue, offering opportunities for settlement in areas where natural sources of flotsam are uncommon. From the perspective of a settling organism, microplastic particles are another hard sub -
stratum. But microplastic debris is unique from some other substrata, as it has limited movement speed and a potential for widespread dispersion that is much greater than an organism may travel during straight trips on ships.
Many species of marine organisms are known to 
attach to marine plastics (Barnes 2002; Barnes and Milner 2005; Astudillo et al. 2009; Gregory 2009; Majer et al. 2012; Zettler et al. 2013; Goldstein et al.  2014) and there is some evidence that microplastics trans -
locate non-indigenous species. Although many of these reports refer to plastic pieces larger than 5 mm, they include species that could easily be transported by microplastics. For example, Calder et al. (2014) identified 14 species of hydroids on debris from the March  2011 Japanese tsunami that washed ashore on the west coast of the United States. At least five of these had not previously been reported from that coast. An extensive review of organisms found on floating plastics has been published by Kiessling et al. (2015).
In the smaller size range, microplastics in seawater 
rapidly develop a biofilm that includes a diverse com -
munity of microbes (Figure 4.7). Biofilm formation was visibly apparent on submerged larger plastic items after 1 week (Lobelle and Cunliffe 2011). This biofilm is a miniature ecosystem that includes primary producers, consumers, predators and decomposers and has been described as a “complex, highly differentiated, multi -
cultural community” analogous to “a city of microbes” (Watnick and Kolter 2000). The microbial biofilm encourages the attachment of larger organisms that use chemical and/or physical characteristics as a cue to settle (Zardus et al. 2008; Hadfield et al. 2014). Most of our current knowledge on the development of bio -
films on plastic surfaces comes from large settlement plates ( >10 cm diameter), but successional dynamics 
of biofilms on small microplastic surfaces might be dif -
ferent, and should be examined in the future.
The large quantities of plastic debris released into the 
ocean environment over the past half-century increase the opportunities for the dispersal of pathogens that may pose threats to humans and marine organisms. However, the relative importance of plastic debris compared to natural floating debris is not known. Fish pathogens may attach to plastics (Zettler et al. 2013; De Tender et al. 2015), potentially toxic dinoflagellates have been shown to be transported on plastics (Masó et al. 2003) and studies have demonstrated that bacteria from the genus Vibrio  are commonly attached to micro -
plastic (De Tender et al. 2015; Zettler et al. 2013) and they have the potential to “bloom” on plastics under the right conditions (Zettler et al. 2013). Plastic debris from the Belgian coast has been found to contain Vibrio  
and potential human pathogens, some distinct from surrounding water and sediment, indicating that plastic debris can act as a distinct habitat and source of these (potential) pathogens (De Tender et al. 2015).GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  63
To date, concentrations of these agents at sea remain 
very low and may not be relevant in terms of risk. However, the behaviour of certain microbes such as vibrios, known to have very fast growth rates, can change when exposed to the gut of a potential host. This may be different in the case of marine species concentrated in aquaculture facilities and ingested microplastics that has been contaminated with harmful microorganisms. In addition, Conn (2014) pointed out that many infectious diseases affect both animals and humans, and aquatic invasive species may be sources of diseases to previously unaffected areas. This study focused on freshwater systems, but a number of infec -
tious diseases can survive in seawater as well.4.6.2
  Impacts
Marine organisms from microbes to invertebrates have always attached to natural floating substrata (macro-algae, feathers, wood, pumice), so one might ask why we should be concerned about plastic transporting organisms? The distribution of plastic is different from that of natural substrata, and plastic has substantially increased the available substratum in oligotrophic open ocean regions, potentially altering the distributions of marine organisms (Goldstein et al. 2012). Another important difference is the longevity of plastic relative to most of the natural substrata, allowing more mature communities to form and persist, perhaps even breed, and thus transport viable populations farther (Kiessling et al. 2015). This may alter connectivity and gene flow and cause effects at the population level.

photosynthetic diatoms (ellipses) and a predatory suctorian ciliate (centre with “tentacles”)
To provide some examples, plastic pellets act as an 
oviposition site for marine insects such as Halobates 
micans  and Halobates sericeus  (Goldstein et al. 2012; 
Majer et al. 2012), having a positive effect on the popu -
lation size and dispersal of this species. Moreover, large abundances of a monospecific foraminiferal assem -
blage of the benthic foraminiferan, Rosalina concinna,  
were among the rich fauna found on floating microplas -
tics sampled in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Barras 2014). This very rare foraminiferal taxon with a planktonic (Tretomphalus) stage is favoured by sexual generation, producing large floating chambers before the release of gametes when surface waters are at temperatures above 18°C.   R. concinna  was found at a 
density of about 20 individuals per 100 cm
2, compara -
ble to its density on natural substrata. Its ability to colo -
nize floating microplastics leads to a significant exten -
sion of the available niches, which could substantially modify the dispersal efficiency of this highly opportu -nistic taxon and enable a benthic species to colonize the pelagic environment. The dynamics of hard-sub -
stratum-associated organisms may be important to understanding the ecological impacts and dynamics of floating plastic on these species but also the con -
nectivity between the various compartments of the marine environment. Lastly, Duarte et al. (2012) pointed out that the increase in human structures in the ocean may be contributing to the increase in jellyfish blooms. The proliferation of microplastic particles provides substratum for attachment and development of jellyfish hydroid life stages. Because pelagic surface waters are typically substratum-limited, microplastics represents another factor that could be contributing to jellyfish blooms. Pyrotag sequences of DNA extracted from microplastics in the Atlantic matched those for a num -
ber of jellyfish that have both medusa and attached 
polyp stages (Amaral-Zettler unpublished). 64  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANThere is some evidence that microplastics can translo -
cate pathogens, interrupt ecological connectivity and 
impact population size and dispersion of species. In addition, hygienic contamination of ingested micro -
plastics may pose health risks to marine organisms and humans. Future work is necessary to understand the extent and scale of any impact. 
4.7 C onclusions, knowledge gaps and 
priorities
4.7.1  Conclusions
I
t is clear from the current weight of evidence that 
microplastic debris has infiltrated nearly all marine 
habitats and over 100 marine species of wildlife. There is evidence that this debris can impact organisms at many levels of biological organization, with the majority of the evidence at levels that are sub-organismal. Much of this evidence has been demonstrated in laboratory studies typically at high concentrations and there is only limited evidence from nature. Thus, there is a clear need for further research regarding the impacts related to microplastic debris.
4.7.2
 Knowledge gaps
I
n this chapter, we were able to discuss evidence 
regarding impacts from microplastics of all sizes, 
including nano-sized microplastics. These impacts can be both physical and chemical in nature and can impact individual organisms via exposure and/or popu -
lations and communities by acting as a vessel for spe -
cies dispersal. But, the weight of the evidence remains small and our review of the literature highlights many gaps in our understanding and thus a critical need for continued research. Below, we outline what we think are research priorities.

5.1 L essons from the first assessment
The GESAMP 2015 report did not specifically address 
fisheries, aquaculture and aquatic species of commer -
cial value. However, the report’s summary of micro -
plastics and potential impacts helps to identify the level of risk that microplastics may pose to these sectors. The report also mentions the potential for fisheries and aquaculture to act as a source of microplastic pollu -
tion and the potential for industry to help mitigate the problem. In the first report, there were knowledge gaps presented that are also relevant to how microplastics may affect commercial fisheries and aquaculture, such as information about nanoparticles, contaminant trans -
fer and impacts on organisms at different life history stages.
Microplastics have been detected in a wide range of 
marine organisms (see Chapter 4), including several commercially important finfish and shellfish species. The impacts of the ingestion of microplastics and their translocation to the most commonly consumed tissues are largely unknown. This chapter summarizes the current status of our knowledge and how microplas -
tics may affect commercial species, aquaculture and fisheries. These issues are relevant to food security, which includes food safety, which has implications for human health. 
5.2 G lobal fisheries and aquaculture 
sectors
Fish provide an important source of protein globally. 
In some places, seafood comprises > 50% of the total 
protein consumed. New evidence demonstrates that wild and cultured seafood products are contami -
nated with microplastics, but we do not yet know to what extent. There is also concern regarding fisheries and aquaculture as a source of microplastics to the marine environment because both sectors use plas -
tics that may degrade/fragment into microplastics. Furthermore, microplastic exposure may be higher in aquaculture systems that use plastics (e.g. nets, pens) compared to wild caught seafood.
Microplastics are a relatively new and emerging con -
taminant; therefore, the threat of microplastics to fish -
eries and aquaculture sectors is currently difficult to 
assess. To improve our understanding of the risk from microplastics to these sectors we have summarized available information on the importance of fisheries and aquaculture, their use of plastics, the exposure of com -
mercial species to microplastics and potential impacts.
5.2.1
 An introduction to seafood
T
he world population has become dependent on fish -
eries and aquaculture resources to meet protein needs, 
promote health and reduce hunger and poverty. Today, 10% to 12 % of the global population relies on fisher -
ies and aquaculture for their livelihood. Such popula -
tions tend to live in developing countries, where both employment opportunities and food resources are lim -
ited (FAO 2014). Global fish production has grown over the last 50 years and aquaculture has become one of the fastest growing food sectors, providing almost half of all human food fish (FAO 2014).
In 2012, 91.3 and 90.4 million tonnes were produced 
from capture fisheries and aquaculture respectively with aquaculture reaching another all-time high in terms of value ($144.4 billion) (FAO 2014). Fish is an impor -
tant food source due to their micro-nutrients. They currently represent 17 % of the global animal intake of 
protein; however, this portion can exceed 50 % for some 
countries (e.g. 51 % in Ghana, 65 % in Cambodia, 70 % in 
Sierra Leone, 71 % Maldives) (FAO 2012). 
A declining, but significant portion (21.7 million tonnes) of fisheries production is used for non-food purposes (e.g. not directly consumed by humans). The majority of this production, 75 % (16.3 million tonnes), is used 
for fishmeal and fish oil (FAO 2014). Fishmeal is largely used as a high protein feed, while fish oil is used in the aquaculture industry and for human consump -
tion (FAO  2014). Typically fishmeal is produced from the whole fish, fish remains or other fish products (e.g. heads, tails, bones, offal). Small pelagic oily fish, especially Anchoveta, are the main groups of species used (FAO 2014). As a result, there has been improved regulation and control of feed fisheries that, along with increased demand for fishmeal and fish oil, has contributed to the increase in their value (FAO 2014). Alternatives to replace fishmeal and fish oil (e.g. zoo -
plankton species) are now being sought and more recently the use of these products in compound feeds for aquaculture has been decreasing (FAO 2014).GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  67
Box 5.1 What are food fish? 
For the purposes of this document we use the FAO definition of “food fish” as follows – finfishes, crustaceans, mol -
luscs, amphibians, freshwater turtles and other aquatic animals (such as sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts and 
edible jellyfish) produced for the intended use as food for human consumption (FAO 2014).
In addition to larger scale, industrial producers, small-scale fisheries are a vital part of the health and diver -
sity of global fisheries. The governance of small-scale, traditional fisheries is discussed by Johnson (2006). It is important to note that because of the great diversity of small-scale fisheries there is no single, agreed defini -
tion for this subsector (FAO 2015). Small-scale fisheries are particularly important in developing countries for their contributions to nutrition, food security, sustain -
able livelihoods and poverty alleviation (FAO 2014).
Global fisheries and aquaculture, at both large and 
small scales, are a vital part of global communities. Microplastic contamination of seafood could pose a threat to these industries. Thus, it is crucial to assess and understand potential impacts to both wild capture and cultured fisheries resources. 
5.2.2
 Captur
e fisheries
Production and species  – The global capture fishery 
production in 2011 was the second highest ever at 
93.7 million tonnes (compared to 93.8 in 1996). China was the largest marine capture fisheries producer with almost three times the volume of Indonesia (second in rank), followed by the US, Peru and Russia (FAO 2014). The top five ranking marine capture species in 2012 were Anchoveta (Engraulis ringens),  Alaska Pollock 
(Theragra chalcogramma),  Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus 
pelamis),  Sardinella  species and Atlantic herring 
(Clupea harengus)  (FAO 2014). Twenty-three species 
comprise approximately 40 % of the total marine catch; 
almost  2/3 of which are small pelagic fish that have large fluctuations due to environmental regimes and, in some cases, are used as raw material in reduction to meal or oil (FAO 2014). Shrimp are also an important capture fishery and hit an all-time high of 3.4 million tonnes in 2012, more than half of which comes from the Northwest and Western Atlantic. The ingestion of microplastics by several of these species and/or similar species (i.e. with a similar life history strategy) has been documented and is described in section 5.3 below, along with potential impacts to fish health.
Fishing gear – A variety of fishing gear and methods 
are used in industrial and small-scale fisheries, some of which are outlined in Chapter 2. Fishing gear for capture fisheries includes surrounding nets (e.g. purse seines), seine nets (e.g. beach seines), trawl nets (e.g. bottom, otter and midwater trawls), dredges, lift nets, traps and hook and lines (Figure 5.1; Thiele and Prado  2005). Nets and floats are made from a range of plastics include polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, polyvinyl chloride, polyamide and polystyrene.

5.2.3
 
Aquaculture
Production and species 
The aquaculture industry is increasingly regarded as an 
alternative to wild capture fisheries to meet the protein demands of a growing human population. As such, it is one of the fastest growing food production sectors and contributed to a record 42.2 % of the total 158 million 
tonnes of food fish from capture fisheries and aquacul -
ture combined (FAO 2014). Asia is the largest contribu -
tor, producing 88 % of global aquaculture by volume (FAO 2014). Global aquaculture can be divided into inland and mariculture. Mariculture production includes all food fish cultured in the sea, intertidal zones and those with land-based production facilities (FAO 2014). Inland (freshwater) culture has been growing faster than mariculture and now contributes 63 % to total 
farmed food fish production as of 2012. It is estimated that over 60 % of the fishery/aquaculture livelihoods are 
generated by inland systems (FAO 2014).68  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANIn 2012, finfish mariculture species contributed 12.6 % 
of the total farmed finfish production. However, their 
total value comprised 26.9 % because of the large pro -
portion of carnivorous species (e.g. Atlantic salmon, trouts) that have higher value per unit compared to farmed freshwater fish (FAO 2014). By species group, world mariculture production was comprised of fin -
fish  (22.4 %), crustacea (15.9 %), molluscs (60.3 %) and 
other species (e.g. sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts and edible jellyfish, 1.4 %). In 2012, a total of 567 
aquaculture species (freshwater and marine) were reg -
istered in FAO statistics (FAO 2014).
Species farmed and farming practices vary widely 
between countries and regions. In Norway and Chile the dominant species for 2012 was Atlantic salmon in marine cage culture. Mussels also represented a signif -icant production source in Chile (FAO 2014). Although the Republic of Korea also uses marine cage culture, over half of their food fish production is marine mol -
luscs. In Thailand, half of the production is crustaceans that are mostly marine shrimp species. Indonesia has a large proportion of finfish aquaculture production in brackish-water ponds and has the fourth-largest marine shrimp sector. Finfish aquaculture (mostly milk -
fish) in marine and brackish water cages dominates production in the Philippines. China produces a wide diversity of species using various farming systems but has a relatively small cage-rearing finfish aquaculture sector (38 % of the total volume of national aquacul-
ture production). The type of culture system can be important in regards to microplastics because it can affect the level of microplastic exposure and generation (see Box 5.2).
Box 5.2 Fisheries and aquaculture practices and exposure 
Finfish and shellfish are cultured using different techniques throughout the world.  Plastics used include, but aren’t 
limited to, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polyethylene and polystyrene. Finfish may be reared on land or open water in ponds, tanks, pens, cages or nets made of plastic materials.  Over time, with UV exposure and other weather processes the plastic may become degraded and fragment or shed microplastic particles and fibres that can be ingested.  Maintenance practices may also accelerate degradation (e.g. net washing, removal of fouling species). 
Examples of culturing systems that use plastics include deep water longline culture where shellfish may be set 
directly on rope, in bags or in plastic trays (Baluyut 1989) or intertidal culture where shellfish are outplanted in mesh bags or other plastic enclosures (Baluyut 1989) and/or may be covered by anti-predator netting.  In fish farming fish are held in nets or pens made of plastics and carnivorous species (e.g. salmon, groupers, snappers) that require fishmeal may be exposed to microplastics directly through their food.  No studies have examined if fishmeal contains microplastics; however there is a high likelihood of microplastic contamination in fishmeal given: i) the prevalence of microplastics in fish observed to date (Table AIII.2), including species commonly used in fishmeal (e.g. sardines, anchovies); and, ii) the use of the whole fish in fishmeal production (most plastics have been observed in the gut). As such, direct measurements are warranted. Another consideration is the length of time seafood species spend in close contact with plastic infrastructure (e.g. fishing nets, cages, longlines) and if/how the larger plastic infrastructure can degrade into or generate microplastics.
Habitat can also affect exposure. Environmental microplastic concentrations vary with depth within the water col -
umn and within the sediment. This can influence microplastic ingestion as demonstrated in Chapter 4.  Further, 
the interaction between habitats and fishing or aquaculture practices may influence exposure to microplastics. For example a bottom-trawling net may re-suspend sediments with microplastics and potentially have more wear and tear compared to a mid-water trawl fishing net.  From a shellfish perspective, mussels reared on longlines made of polypropylene rope may be subjected to higher concentrations of microplastics than scallops reared on hard plastic trays. Fishing and aquaculture practices that use plastic and accelerate degradation processes may put finfish and shellfish at greater risk of microplastic exposure.
Aquaculture practices and systems 
Aquaculture practices and systems vary widely around 
the world according to the species and environment it is cultured in. Below are some examples of common culture practices grouped by environment followed by a detailed description of a select few. For a more detailed review of culture practices see Baluyut (1989).
Finfish and shrimp culture practices
The breeding or rearing of fish in artificial or natural 
ponds or basins is the earliest form of aquaculture dat -
ing back to 1137 B.C. (Baluyut 1989). It is still used for many organisms such as shrimp and finfish in freshwa -
ter, brackish water and marine environments. Plastics used in this type of culture include nursery cages for smaller life history stages (Kungvankij et al. 1986), PVC pipes for water drainage and flow, pond liners (often made of high density polyethylene) and mesh screens to prevent undesirable organisms from getting into the ponds. 
Fish cages and pens are generally comprised of a net 
stretched over a framework structure (Figure 5.2). Nets are often made of polyethylene and nylon monofilament twine although wire mesh is used in several countries (Baluyut 1989). Bamboo or other locally available wood is used for the framework structure. Several different cage flotation materials can be used including bamboo, PVC pipes/containers, steel or plastic drums, expand -
ed polystyrene and aluminium floats (Baluyut 1989). GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  69

Mollusc culture practices
Longline culture
Longline culture is used for mussels, oysters, scallops 
and other species worldwide. This can entail a variety of configurations consisting of longlines hanging from some type of float, raft or a line strung between floats. Some species (e.g. scallops and oysters) may be placed in polyethylene trays or lantern nets (Figure 5.3) hanging from floats. This is similar to the hanging method of oyster culture that uses oyster shells or simi -
lar materials as collectors. These are then strung on synthetic twine or heavy monofilament nylon attached to a rack/tray of bamboo or wood (Baluyut 1989). Natural and synthetic ropes are often used for spat collection (e.g. in the Philippines). Natural ropes attract more larvae than polyethylene or polypropylene ropes but don’t last as long; therefore, a hybrid of the two is often used (Baluyut 1989). A wide variety of materials are used for scallop spat collection including polyethyl -
ene mesh bags, nylon and teased polypropylene rope (Lovatelli 1987).

British Columbia, taken by Centre for Shellfish Research, Vancouver Island University
Stake method 
In shallow waters ( <1 m at low tide) with soft sediment 
the stake method is often used. This involves stakes, usually comprised of bamboo trunks or mangrove branches (Baluyut 1989) spaced apart to serve as attachment for spat (juvenile shellfish). 
Hanging method – Oyster or mussels are collected on 
oyster shells or other collectors and attached to syn -
thetic twine or heavy monofilament nylon. These are then spread out over stakes or a wooden or bamboo platform (Baluyut 1989).
Bottom culture – Shellfish can be cultured on the sea -
floor in deep or shallow water. Species cultured in this 
manner include clams, cockles, mussels and oysters. This may involve the use of fencing, often made from low-density polyethylene and/or anti-predator nets made from a variety of polymers including polyethylene and polypropylene.70  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN5.3 Mi croplastic contamination and impact 
on fisheries and aquaculture products
Microplastics have been documented in both fin -
fish and shellfish consumed by humans. However, 
the microplastic concentration in the edible tissues (i.e. flesh) is unknown for finfish. Plastic infrastructure is used widely in both fisheries and aquaculture hence there is concern about these sectors serving as a source microplastics that may contaminate seafood products. The limited studies to date indicate that farmed seafood could have higher microplastic con -
centrations than wild collected seafood. The ubiquitous nature of plastics and their potential to find their way into seafood products consumed by humans has led to concern about the potential threat of microplastics to seafood safety. Microplastic contamination and impact on commercial finfish, shellfish and other species is discussed below. 
5.3.1
 Microplastics in commercial finfish
M
icroplastic ingestion has been observed in a wide 
range of marine organisms (see Chapter 4), several of 
which are commercially important for both large- and small-scale fisheries (e.g. Anchovy, Indian Mackerel) (Annex Table AIII.2). How long the plastic stays in the stomach (e.g. residence time), and therefore the length of exposure to the microplastics and associated chemicals, is unknown. To date, studies are largely limited to examining microplastics in the gut and/or digestive tract, particularly for finfish, and transfer to other tissues is known only for a handful of invertebrate bspecies. This information is particularly important to fisheries and aquaculture because microplastics, and associated chemicals in or on them, may be trans -
ferred into the parts of the food fish that are consumed by humans.
In the following section we have compiled the available 
information on the ingestion of microplastics by com -
mercially important marine species.
Ingestion  Field studies have demonstrated the inges -
tion of microplastics in several commercial fish spe -
cies, pelagic and benthic (bottom dwelling) fish, from 
the English channel (Lusher et al. 2013), the North Sea (Foekema et al. 2013), the Indian Ocean (Kripa at al. 2014), the eastern Pacific Ocean (Rochman et al. 2015a; Choy and Drazen 2013), the Indo-Pacific Ocean (Rochman et al. 2015a) and the north-eastern Atlantic (Neves et al. 2015). Information is available for non-commercial species globally (e.g. Boerger et al. 2010; Jantz et al. 2013), many of which are prey for larger fish. Research from the Mediterranean Sea (Avio et al. 2015), the Arabian Sea (Sulochanan et al. 2014) and the tropi -
cal Atlantic (Dantas et al. 2012) confirm the perception that fish are exposed to and ingest plastic particles globally (for an extensive list see Annex Table AIII.2).
Several different species of commercial fish, both 
pelagic and demersal, have been documented with microplastics in their guts. These include the pelagic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus),  swordfish (Xiphias 
gladius),  albacore (Thunnus alalunga),  Atlantic herring 
Clupea harengus,  sardine Sardina pilchardus,  European 
and Pacific anchovies (Engraulis spp.),  Indian mack -
erel (Rastrelliger kanagurta),  benthic/demersal hake 
(Merlucius merlucius),  blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou),  red mullet (Mullus barbatus),  small scale 
gurnard (Chelidonichthys lucernus)  and common dol-
phin fish  (Coryphaena hippurus)  (Foekema et al. 2013; 
Kripa et al. 2014; Rochman et al. 2015a; Romeo et al. 2015; Lusher et al. 2013; Avio et al. 2015; Deudero and Alomar 2015). At present, 89 species of fish have been reported to ingest microplastics. Of those, 49 species are targeted commercially. Insufficient data from differ -
ent spatial regions prevents geographical comparison. 
Although not often commercially targeted, mesope -
lagic fish are an important component of the oceanic 
ecosystem (Gjøsaeter and Kawaguchi 1980). They have also recently been identified as potential future target species for fishmeal. Mesopelagic fish from the fam -
ily Myctophidae have been reported with microplastic debris from both the Atlantic (Boerger et al. 2010) and the Pacific Oceans (Davison and Asch 2011). In the North Atlantic, 11 % of individuals from 10 species of 
mesopelagic fish contained microplastics (Lusher et al. 2015 ICES JMS). Their high lipid content would benefit the growing demand from aquaculture for fish proteins and oil (FAO, 2010). With a global biomass estimated  >1,000 million tonnes (Irigoien et al. 2014), 
this fisheries resource is still underutilized. 
The number and size range of microplastics found in 
fish gut contents varies from 0 to 83 items per fish and between 0.1 mm to >5 mm (Annex Table AIII.2), the big -
gest ones being found in large predators. Information on fish (species, common name, numbers studied, % 
containing microplastics, mean number/range of par -
ticles ingested, type, size, location fish were caught) are presented in Annex Table AIII.2. Common plastic polymers found in fish are polyethylene, polypropyl -
ene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl -
chloride and nylon. Their presence is related to the worldwide use of these plastics in many applications. The sources of microplastics found in commercial fish are unknown, although some of the plastic polymers reported in the English Channel and in the coast of Portugal are representative of those used in the fishing industry, which may allude to a possible source (Lusher et al. 2013; Neves et al. 2015).
Impact of ingestion Species of commercial fish do 
ingest microplastics, but at present we know very little about the impact to fish health. Microplastics may be egested along with faecal material, retained within the digestive tract, or translocate between tissues (this is more likely for nano-sized plastics). The retention and possible translocation of microplastics raises concern regarding whether the chemicals associated with microplastics may transfer into the tissues (i.e. the meat) of an organism. Microplastics accumulate contaminants from the environment and leach addi -
tives introduced during manufacturing (see Chapter 4). Because there is potential for chemicals associated with plastics to transfer to fish, research is needed to assess the impact of this interaction. In particular, stud -
ies should focus on contamination of the edible frac -
tions that may pose a risk to human health. At present, we can only extrapolate results from laboratory feeding studies and observations in nature that focus on non-commercial fish species. These studies have looked at contaminant transfer and endpoints, such as accumu -
lation in the tissues and altered predatory behaviour, and are described below. GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  71
 
Figure 5.4  A maximum likelihood inferred genealogy of fish based on barcoding gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) 
depicting the fish species found to contain microplastics (in red) reported in the literature as of November 2015. 
Commercially important species are denoted with a food symbol while species in green are closely related to those 
genera found to contain microplastics but for which no COI gene was available in public databases. The following 
species are represented by closely related species in the tree: Astronesthes indopacificus, Diaphus phillipsi, 
Hygophum reinhardtii, Myctophum aurolaternatum and Sciades herzbergii. Species in black may also consume 
microplastics but have not yet been reported in the literature to do so. The tree was constructed using RAxML 7.2.8 as 
implemented in Geneious R8 (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland New Zealand) and included 216 species and 585 
homologously aligned nucleotide positions. The COI gene is not recommended for establishing more distant 
relationships between species so branching order should be interpreted with discretion. See Table AIII.2 for additional 
relevant data
Very few laboratory experiments have examined expo -
sure to microplastics in commercial fish species. These 
include the recent work of Mazurais et al. (2014) who looked at sea bass larvae (Dicentrarchus labrax),  Avio 
et al. (2015) with the grey mullet (Mugil cephalus)  and 
an earlier study of gastric evacuation in the cod (Gadus morhua)  by Santos and Jobling (1992). Concentrations 
of microplastics in these experiments are many times above what is commonly found in the environment. Particles have been used alone or in combination with metals or natural prey to assess different end -
points after variable exposure times (see Table AIII.1). Microplastic particles decreased growth rate of sea bass larvae, but no effects were detected in grey mul -
lets (Mugil cephalus),  though microplastics could be 
found in the stomach and liver. Other studies have examined the impacts from micro -
plastics in fish that are non-commercial but can be used as models for other species of fish, including commercial fish. In juveniles of the common goby (Pomatoschistus microps),  environmentally realistic 
concentrations of microplastics caused a decrease in predatory performance due to confusion of microplas -
tics with food and AChE inhibition (a neurotransmitter; Luís et al. 2015; de Sá et al. 2015). These two studies also showed evidence that developmental stage and environmental conditions experienced during devel-opment may influence the susceptibility of fish to ingest microplastics. Another study also observed toxic effects in the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes)  
from an exposure to microplastic with and without envi -
ronmentally relevant concentrations of organic chemi -72  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANcal contaminants. Effects including hepatic stress and 
changes in gene expression were observed (Rochman et al. 2013a, 2014a). Still, it should be noted that find -
ings from controlled laboratory experiments should be interpreted with caution as results are difficult to extrapolate to the field, where multiple factors interact and co-vary.
A large number of wild-caught fish have been reported 
to ingest microplastics. As studies continue investigat -
ing additional species, it is likely that this number will rise. However, given the current level of knowledge and limited availability of data, we cannot interpret the effects of microplastics on commercial fish species. Future research should be directed towards commer -
cially targeted species and those fish that constitute their prey. It will also be important to focus laboratory research on retention times of microplastics to evalu -
ate exposure time and bioaccumulation of associated contaminants (e.g. PCBs, PBDEs) in the tissues; and to be able to relate the observed effects to microplastic concentrations. Furthermore, studies to date have documented microplastics in fish guts rather than the tissues that are typically eaten by humans. There is an urgent need to evaluate the presence of microplastics and associated contaminants in the edible fractions of the fish and other products for human consumption (e.g. fish oil) so that the potential hazard of microplas -
tics to the consumer can be assessed. This information is crucial to predict the risk to fish populations, that may compromise commercial fisheries, and also to human health.
5.3.2
 Microplastics in shellfish and other species
M
icroplastics have been observed in many com -
mercial species other than fish, including mussels, 
clams, oysters and scallops. Research has examined laboratory exposure of microplastics in many of these animals as well as contamination in wild and cultured animals, including some that were store-bought in Europe, North America and Asia (De Witte et al. 2014; Li et al.  2015; Van Cauwenberge and Jansen 2014; Rochman et al. 2015a; Vandermerrsch et al. 2015). The possibility of transfer to human consumers is elevated because shellfish are eaten whole. Below we highlight examples of microplastic ingestion and the potential physical and chemical consequences to commercially important species.
Microplastics identified in shellfish range in size 
from 5 µm to 5 mm and are composed of fragments, pellets and fibres. Fibres seem to be one of the most common types of microplastics found in invertebrate food fish. In 8 of 9 species of shellfish sampled from an Asian fish market, fibres constituted more than 52 % 
of plastic items per species, with the exception of Alectryonella plicata  where pellets were most abundant 
at 60% (Li et al. 2015). In a European study synthetic 
fibres were also the dominant microplastics and ranged from 200µm up to 1500µm size (De Witte et al. 2014). 
Occurrence in mussels and other bivalves 
In nature, both wild and cultured mussels (Mytilus 
edulis)  have been found to ingest microplastics. Some 
studies collected animals from the field and others from aquaculture farms or purchased directly from the market. The concentrations of microplastics found in M. edulis  studies ranged from 0 to 34 particles per g 
(wet weight) (Li et al. 2015; Vandermeersch et al. 2015; De Witte et al. 2014; Van Cauwenberghe and Jansen 2014; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2015). Only one study has directly compared microplastic concentrations in farmed and wild M. edulis  in Nova Scotia, Canada 
(Mathalon and Hill 2014). Microplastic concentrations were higher in farmed mussels (average 178 fibres per farmed mussel compared to 126 microfibres per wild mussel). The authors suggest this difference may be due to contamination from the plastic rope longlines the mussels are cultured on (Box 5.4). 
Although many observations have been made with 
Mytilus edulis,  other species of shellfish have also 
been found to be contaminated by microplastics. The brown mussel, Perna perna,  is another mussel with 
commercial value on tropical coasts that is suscep -
tible to microplastic contamination. Microplastics were observed in 75 % of brown mussels from the Santos 
estuary, a highly urbanized area on the Southeast coast of Brazil (São Paulo state; Santana et al. submitted).
Microplastics have also been observed in wild and 
cultured Manila clams (Ruditapes philippinarum)  (S. 
Dudas personal communication), oysters (Crassostrea gigas, Alectryonella plicatula)  (Van Cauwenberghe and 
Jansen  2014, Li et al. 2015; Rochman et al., 2015a) and several species sold in a Chinese fishery mar -
ket such as Scapharca clams, ark clams (Tegillarca granosa),  razor clams (Sinonovacula constricta),  scal -
lops (Placopecten yessoensis),  Mediterranean mus -
sels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)  and venus clam species 
(Meretrix lusoria, Cyclina sinensis and  Ruditapes philip -
pinarum) (Li et al. 2015).
Similar to finfish, there is little information regarding the effects of microplastics on shellfish. The effect of microplastic ingestion on feeding modes and gut passage time have only been observed in Mytilus edulis  and Placopecten magellanicus  (Brillant and 
MacDonald  2000, 2002; Ward et al. 2003; Ward and Kach 2009).
As described in Chapter 4, microplastic particles can 
have physical and/or chemical consequences to an animal upon exposure. There are many studies that have examined the impacts of microplastics in mus -
sels. One study showed that microplastics (2 to 16 µm) can be retained by Mytilus edulis  following ingestion 
(Browne et al. 2008) and that the particles in the size range 3 to 9.6 µm can be translocated outside the gut and into the hemolymph. Other studies also observed the transfer of microplastic to the circulatory system and some with consequential toxicity, including reduc -
tion in function of the reproductive system and inflam -
mation (formation of granulocytomas) (von Moos et al. 2012; Avio et al. 2015). In contrast, another study found that Mytilus edulis  reject nano-sized particles 
of plastics as pseudofaeces before ingesting them (Wegner et al. 2012). Still, there can be an energetic cost associated with pseudofaeces production, thus long-term exposure to microplastics may negatively impact individuals. In oysters, exposure of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)  to microplastics indicated 
effects on reproduction (Sussarellu et al. 2016).GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  73
In a laboratory study, direct bioaccumulation of asso -
ciated chemicals from microplastics was also dem -
onstrated in clean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis. 
Mussels that ingested and assimilated polyethylene and polystyrene particles contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bioaccumulated the chemical in their tissues (Avio et al. 2015).
Box 5.3 Can shellfish depuration reduce microplastic contamination?
When shellfish are grown in waters contaminated by domestic and industrial wastes they must be depurated to 
ensure satisfactory microbiological and chemical quality of the product for consumption (Baluyut 1989). This is because bivalves filter their food from the water. Along with phytoplankton and microbes, they filter, and can con -
centrate, contaminants (including chemicals and microplastics) present in the water column. Depuration is a kind of purification system where shellfish are held in clean seawater in conditions that facilitate maximum filtration activity (i.e. to expel the intestinal contents) and that enhance separation of the expelled contents to avoid recontamination (Lovatelli et al. 2008). To date, only one study has examined the potential for reducing microplastic contamination in shellfish through depuration. This study showed that without any depuration, farmed mussels from Germany con -
tained on average 0.36 ± 0.07 particles/g wet weight. After three days of depuration, this average was reduced to 0.24 ± 0.07 particles/g wet weight (Van Cauwenberghe and Jansen 2014). In another species, C. gigas,  microplas -
tic concentration decreased after depuration from 0.47 ± 0.16 particles to 0.35 ± 0.05 particles/g wet weight (Van Cauwenberghe and Jansen 2014).  More research is urgently needed to investigate the utility of longer depuration times and depuration using running water to reduce microplastic load in shellfish.
Crustaceans
Commercially important crustaceans also ingest 
microplastics. Green crabs (Carcinus maenas)  were 
found to ingest microplastics under controlled condi-tions (Farrell and Nelson, 2013; Watts et al. 2014). This ingestion was observed through contaminated food consumption (mussels artificially contaminated with microplastics), thereby suggesting the possibility of trophic transfer. Farrell and Nelson (2013) identified the assimilation and persistence of microplastics within the crabs over 21 days. Microplastics were found in the stomach, hepatopancreas, ovary and gills (Farrell and Nelson, 2013). Watts et al. (2014) noted that ventilation through the gills was another route of uptake in crabs. 
Lobsters, Nephrops norvegicus,  sampled from the 
Clyde Sea (Scottish coast), also had microplastics in 
their stomachs. About 83 % of the individuals examined 
had ingested plastics that ranged in volume and size, that were mainly composed of monofilaments (Murray and Cowie, 2011). 
Natural populations of brown shrimp (Crangon cran -
gon),  sampled across the English Channel area and 
Southern part of the North Sea (between France, 
Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK) were found to be contaminated with microplastics as well (Devriese et al. 2015). Shrimp from different locations did not have sig -
nificantly different plastic content (Devriese et al. 2015). In total, 63 % of the animals examined were contami -
nated with microplastics, which were mostly com -
posed of synthetic fibres (96.5 %, ranging from 200µm 
up to 1000µm size) (Devriese et al. 2015). C. crangon had, on average, 1.03 fibres/g wet weight (Devriese et al.  2015). The amount of microplastic ingested by C. crangon varied temporally, possibly due to seasonal fluctuations on the occurrence of plastic (Devriese et al. 2015). The authors also investigated the relation -
ship between the condition of the shrimp and the level of contamination of microplastics within an individual. No relationship was found, indicating that microplastic contamination does not affect the health of the shrimp (Devriese et al. 2015).Gastropods 
Two studies reported on the presence or absence of 
microplastics in edible snails collected from the Dutch coast: 30 microplastics per gram d.w. in periwinkles (Littorina littorea)  (Leslie et al. 2013) while microplastic 
could not be detected in common limpet (Patella vul -
garis)  (Karlsson 2015). 
Echinoderms
Sea urchin larvae, Tripneustes gratilla,  exposed under 
laboratory conditions to microplastics in various con -
centrations (1 to 300 particles/ml, with an exposure 
duration of 1 to 9 days) ingested and egested micro -
plastic particles (Kaposi et al. 2014). The impact of ingestion was not investigated. Earlier research on sea cucumbers found that Holothuria  sp. selectively 
ingested plastic particles in preference to food items (Graham and Thompson 2009). The commercial market targets the body of the organism and removes their gut. If microplastics are translocating from the gut to the tis -
sue of the organisms there could be concerns relating to bioaccumulation in the food chain. However, the data available for echinoderms suggest that microplastics are removed along with faecal material. 
Microplastics have been observed in several types 
of seafood cultured and caught for human consump -
tion (Rochman et al. 2015a; Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014). Consequently there is increasing con -
cern for human health and food safety (EFSA 2016). Given the potential for microplastic pollution in edible tissues of commercial fish or in the by-products (e.g. fishmeal and fish oil) there is an urgent need for more research in this area. 74  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANBox 5.4 Microplastic contamination in wild versus cultured seafood
There are few studies to date that make direct comparisons between microplastic contamination levels in wild and 
cultured organisms and they are limited to shellfish. Preliminary studies found that farmed mussels from Nova Scotia had significantly higher microplastic concentrations than wild mussels (Mathalon and Hill 2014). A preliminary study on Manila clams conducted on the west coast of Canada showed higher microplastic concentrations in farmed clams (~12 microplastic particles/farmed clam versus ~9 particles/wild clam (Davidson and Dudas submitted) but these differences were not significant. Differences in methods and the biology of clams versus mussels may explain the different findings. In Mathalon and Hill’s study (2014), cultured mussels were purchased from a grocery store rather than being obtained directly from the farms, which introduces the potential for contamination because bivalves often gape when frozen. Additionally, mussel farming methods differ from those used to grow clams. Most mussels on the eastern coast of Canada are grown on long-line (DFO 2015). The fraying of plastic-based ropes in close contact with growing mussels may influence the amount of microplastics ingested compared to other methods with fewer plastic structures (e.g. bottom or rack culture). Farmed mussels (Mytilus edulis)  and oysters (Crassostrea gigas)  from 
Germany were also found to harbour microplastics (Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen, 2014). Farmed mussels from the North Sea (Germany) had an average of 0.36 ± 0.07 particles/g, which is much lower than the concentration observed in farmed Manila clams above (1.7 ± 1.2 particles/g). This may be due, in part, to the lack of plastics used for mussel culture in this study. Culture methods, ocean currents, extent of shellfish farming, and coastal develop -
ment may all affect microplastic contamination. Finally, clams and mussels have very different filtration rates (Cusson et al. 2005; Hadley and Whetstone, 2007) and have variable longevity depending on the age they are harvested for market sales, both of which will influence microplastic particle concentration. All of these factors are important con -
siderations for assessing the risk of microplastics for organismal and human exposure.
5.4 I mpacts on food security
Microplastics are found in a variety of species con -
sumed by humans and thus there is concern about their potential to negatively affect food safety and potentially, food security. Impacts will be dependent upon consumption rates and patterns (e.g. species and anatomy consumed). Data on microplastic contamina -
tion of seafood products, particularly edible tissues, is very limited thus the risk of microplastic consump -
tion on human health is unknown. The section below describes the potential risk of microplastics on food security and the implications for human health.
5.4.1
 Food safety and security
A
nthropogenic debris has become widespread in the 
marine environment globally. As such, there is con -
cern about whether the ingestion of anthropogenic 
debris, such as microplastics by marine animals, can cascade up the food web to influence fish stocks and/or human health. It is clear from scientific studies that microplastics have infiltrated marine food webs to the level of humans via seafood (Rochman et al. 2015a; Li et al. 2015; Van Cauwenberghe and Jansen 2014). The physical harm that anthropogenic debris causes to marine animals at several levels of biological organiza -
tion (Rochman et al. 2015b) can potentially threaten local food availability in locations where debris is abundant and seafood is a major source of protein to the local population (e.g. Indonesian island communi -
ties). Moreover, anthropogenic debris is associated with a cocktail of hazardous chemicals (see Chapter 4). Consequently, there is concern that chemicals from plastic may be transferring to humans via diets con -
taining fish and shellfish, raising important questions regarding consequences for human health. The impli -
cations of microplastics for food safety, security and human health are discussed below.Food safety is a term used to describe several facets (e.g. chemical, microphysical and microbiological) of food handling, preparation and storage to prevent ill -
ness and injury (Hanning et al. 2012). Microplastics may affect food safety as a contaminant or via the chemical contaminants on them (see Chapter 4) that could be transferred into food. Food safety and secu -
rity are interrelated as shown in Figure 5.8 (Hanning et al. 2012). While food safety ensures that the food is safe from chemical, physical or biological stand -
points, food security ensures there is enough access to, and enough food for people to lead productive lives (Hanning et al. 2012).
The World Food Summit (1996) states that: ‘food secu -
rity exists when all people, at all times, have physical 
and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food prefer -
ences for an active and healthy life’. This encompasses the following four dimensions (FAO 2008): 
i.
 A
vailability – food must be available based on 
food production, stock levels and trade; ii.
 A
ccess – food must be physically (e.g. food sup -
ply) and economically accessible (e.g. affordability); iii.
 U
tilization – the way the body uses nutrients 
combined with feeding practices, food preparation, 
diet diversity and household distribution of food will determine nutritional status of individuals and, 
iv.
 S
tability – the above three dimensions must be 
stable over time to ensure food security. Microplastics have the potential to affect the availabil -
ity, use and stability dimensions of food security and 
within them elements of food safety as well.GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  75
Figure 5.5  Relationship between elements of food safety and food security (Hanning et al. 2012)
Availability 
To date, there have been no demonstrated impacts of 
how plastic debris impacts fish stocks. This is in part because researchers have not investigated this and because it is challenging to address. Typical concerns with marine debris and fisheries and aquaculture are focused on the negative impacts of derelict fishing gear such as nets and traps (Kühn et al. 2015). Several studies have shown that many individual organisms are killed by derelict gear (Uhrin and Shellinger 2011; Good et al. 2010), but these studies have not tested whether this leads to population-level declines (Rochman et al. 2015b). Larger marine debris has also been shown to impact subsistence fishers’ behaviour (i.e. avoiding preferred fishing grounds) when it is abundant enough to pose a significant entanglement hazard (Nash 1992). These changes in behaviour may affect them economi -
cally (see Section 6.3).
Box 5.5 Toxicity of plastics used in fisheries and aquaculture
Plastics used in aquaculture and fishing operations include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene, polyurethane 
foam, polystyrene and nylon.  Although microplastics aren’t used directly in aquaculture the large plastics used (e.g. cages, rope) may provide a secondary source of microplastics through degradation. Based upon the chemical composition of the plastic material or the sorption properties, some plastic types may be innately less hazardous than others. For example, PVC, polystyrene and polyurethane foam all contain monomers and/or additive ingredients which are known to be hazardous, whereas the monomers and ingredients of polyethylene and polypropylene are benign (Lithner et al. 2011). Moreover, Rochman et al. (2013 ES&T) and Lee et al. (2014) have demonstrated that poly -
ethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane and polystyrene consistently accumulate greater concentrations of persistent organic pollutants than PVC and PET (Rochman et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2014). Sorptive behaviour and chemical ingre -
dients must be considered together. Although PVC sorbs relatively small concentrations of hazardous organic chemi -
cals, its vinyl chloride monomer is classified as carcinogenic and toxic (Lithner et al. 2011).  In addition, PVC contains more hazardous additives than polyethylene and polypropylene (Lithner et al. 2011).  Polyethylene terephthalate has been suggested as one of the least hazardous plastics (Lithner et al. 2011; Rochman et al. 2013 ES&T) because it sorbs smaller concentrations of chemicals, requires fewer additives and degrades faster than other polymers. 
Based upon information regarding impacts from larger plastic debris, people perceive there will be impacts from microplastic, but at present, this has not been tested and/or demonstrated.  Microplastics can har -
bour pathogens that could negatively impact fisheries, as diseases are a major source of loss in aquaculture of molluscs, crustaceans and fish (Zettler et al. 2013; Lafferty et al. 2015). Snoussi et al. (2009) showed that potentially pathogenic strains of Vibrio  adhere to and 
persist on plastic surfaces associated with marine fish aquaculture, and more recently  bacteria in the genus Vibrio  have been found on microplastics drifting in the 
North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (Zettler et al. 2013). Certain strains of Vibrio  (e.g. Vibrio parahaemolyticus)  
can cause illness in humans, shellfish, finfish and crus -
taceans. Shellfish closures due to this illness can be devastating to the industry and have large economic impacts if the closures are prolonged. Another impact may arise from the priority pollutants that are associ -
ated with plastic debris which are known to cause 76  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANtoxic effects at certain concentrations (Rochman et 
al. 2013b; see Chapter 4). 
It is also important to consider the impact of consumer 
perception on food availability. As our knowledge of microplastics and their presence in fish and other foods increases so does consumer concern. If con -
sumers feel that fish are unsafe to eat then it becomes ‘unavailable’ to them whether this perception is accu -
rate or not. It may also reduce the value of seafood products that are thought to be contaminated. Because of this, it is important that we do not overstate the impacts of microplastics in marine organisms before we fully understand them. See Section 6.3.2 for further discussions about the potential impacts on consumer perception.
Use
During food preparation and cooking, microplastics 
in seafood will be subject to heat that can influence the leaching of chemical ingredients and sorbed con -
taminants from the debris. As such, it is important to consider how food use and preparation may impact the toxicity of the microplastics in seafood. Heating plastic can influence the kinetics of the chemicals present and/or cause them to transform into different forms (e.g. dioxin). For example, plastics can leach bisphenol A, styrenes and phthalates, all of which can have implica -
tions for human health (Halden 2010). 
Stability
Marine debris and microplastics are a persistent pol -
lutant, but there can be sudden increases from events 
such as seasonal rains, storms or tsunamis that can cause large amounts of debris to enter the ocean quickly (see Section 2.4.2). Plastic degradation can also be accelerated by environmental conditions that promote wear and decomposition (e.g. storms, higher temperatures). It is possible that microplastics could increase locally or regionally over a shorter period of time due to these stresses and affect the stability of seafood resources.
5.4.2
 Global consumption patter
ns
Consumption volumes and species
Japan and the USA have the highest import value of 
seafood (for individual countries) followed by China with half of their value (FAO 2014). The European Union is the largest trader of fishery and aquaculture prod -
ucts in the world with a value of $47 billion in  2012, representing 36 % of total world imports (FAO  2014). 
In terms of the contribution of fish to animal pro -
tein supply, Greenland, Japan, the Philippines and Portugal are among some of the top consumers which consume  >10 g per capita/day representing more 
than  20 % of the contribution of fish to animal protein 
supply (FAO 2014). At a global level, the consumption of fish is around 20 kg/capita/year. This is equivalent to an average intake of 10g of fish protein/capita/day. This number is much higher for high fish consumers. In Asia a relatively high per capita consumption rate is combined with large populations making it the most important fish-consuming region, followed by Europe (FAO 1998). Although average per capita fish consump -
tion is usually lower in developing countries, fish may be the staple food in coastal areas and is an important protein source for the poor (FAO 2014).
Detailed information on consumption of different types 
of seafood (e.g. finfish, molluscs etc.) is very limited. However, in the recent SOFIA report (2014), fish con -
sumption in the Asia-Pacific Region was assessed using household surveys and some highlights are pre -
sented below (Box 5.6). Although species-specific con -
sumption patterns are difficult to ascertain it is crucial information for assessing the risk of microplastics and how they relate to seafood and human consumption. 
What parts of the fish are consumed?
Depending on the region, culture, size of fish, and food 
preparation, different parts of fish and shellfish may be consumed. Shellfish are generally consumed whole with the exception of certain species such as scallops from which the muscle and gonads are consumed. Most countries consume finfish flesh while consump -
tion of fish heads, viscera and other body parts are less common. Solid wastes or by-products generated by fisheries vary by species but can represent a significant portion of the original material (e.g. 65 % for the tuna 
canning industry). Direct human consumption of fish by-products has been increasing in recent years and alternative uses for these by-products are being found (FAO 2014). For example, fish viscera and frames are used as a potential source of protein hydrolysate for its potential as a source of bioactive peptides (FAO 2014). In the salmon industry in Norway, of the 45,800 tonnes of heads, frames, belly flaps and trimmings, 24 % 
(11,000 tonnes) were used for human consumption and the rest for feed (Olafsen 2011 cited from FAO  2014). Often after gutting or filleting salmon, the heads, frames and trimming are purchased for use in soups or other dishes (FAO 2014). These considerations are very important as they will affect the level of microplastic exposure in humans. 
Unfortunately current studies only document micro -
plastics in the gut and intestinal tract of fish, highlight -
ing the need for information on contamination of other 
tissues. This is particularly true for regions with high consumption rates of seafood, such as the Pacific Islands, Cambodia and the Philippines. These coun -
tries consume some species of fish that have been found to ingest microplastics. While studies showing translocation to edible tissues are limited, it is possible that microplastic can transfer to the meat, particularly at the nanoscale.

5.4.3
 Human health implications
T
he impacts of micro- and specifically very small 
microplastics (i.e. nanoplastics – particles < 1000 nm in 
at least one of its dimensions) on human health are not 
well documented (Eerkes-Medrano et al. 2015) and our knowledge about the fate and toxicity of plastic par -
ticles for humans is unknown (Van Cauwenberghe and Janssen 2014; Bouwmeester et al. 2015; GESAMP 2015). In relation to food safety, the possible impacts of micro -
plastic on human health will rely on dietary exposure via contaminated marine foodstuffs. In general three possible effects of plastic particles can be recognized: 1) particle toxicity caused by the very small (nano-size and lower micro-size range) plastic particles them -
selves due to interaction with external tissues and cells or after translocation into tissues and cells; 2) chemical toxicity due to the leaching of additives added to the microplastics during manufacturing or the release of pollutants that have accumulated onto the plastics in nature and 3) disease risks due to microbial contamina -
tion of microplastics. In theory, cumulative effects can occur through particle and chemical toxicity after the particles have been internalized in tissues or chemical mixture toxicity effects (see Chapter 4).
Box 5.7 Contaminants in seafood
Seafood can become contaminated through environmental exposure or during production. Several contaminants are 
monitored in seafood to ensure that levels are within acceptable limits for consumption. Many of these contaminants have been documented on plastic either as additives to the plastics or contaminants that have adsorbed from the environment (see Chapter 4). Microplastics have the potential to introduce chemical contaminants into organisms destined for human consumption or to remove them (see Chapter 4). The potential for microplastic to increase the concentration of harmful chemicals in seafood is a concern for food safety. The following are some of the most com -
mon contaminants in seafood and their documentation on microplastics (in bold) (Seafish 2015): lead, cadmium,  mer-
cury, dioxins and PCBs, PAHs, brominated flame retardants, marine biotoxins, histamine, radionuclides, melamine 
and structural analogues. 
It is evident that humans are exposed to micro and nanoplastics through the consumption of marine food stuffs, including shellfish, fish and sea salt. In addition to seafood, humans may be exposed to microplastics via other routes, including drinking water, bathing waters, inhalation from air and/or  via active contact with cosmetics (Napper et al. 2015). Microplastics have been detected in a variety of terrestrial foodstuffs such as honey, drinking water, beer, sugar and table salt (Liebezeit and Liebezeit 2013, 2015; Yang et al. 2015). An analysis and assessment of the potential health risk of microplastics for humans should comprise dietary exposure from a range of foods across the total diet in order to assess the contributing risk of contaminated marine food items (GESAMP 2015). 
An overview of microplastic concentrations in marine, 
freshwater and terrestrial foodstuffs is given in Table  5.1. Among the various types of seafood, con -
sumption of filter feeding invertebrates, such as mus -
sels or oysters, appears the most likely route of human exposure to microplastics. One study has attempted to estimate potential dietary exposure based on observed microplastic concentrations in seafood and approxi-mated consumption rates. This study estimated dietary exposure for mussel consumers to range between 78  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANabout  11,000 (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2014) and 
100,000 microplastic particles per person/year (see GESAMP 2015). Dietary exposure for shrimp consum -
ers (90 % removed by peeling) may amount to much 
lower exposure levels of 175 microplastics per year (Devriese et al. 2015). 
The commonly used analytical techniques introduce a 
great bias in the knowledge, since they are only able to detect plastic particles well above the nano-range (see Chapter 7; Bouwmeester et al. 2015; GESAMP 2015). It is plausible that the smaller particles pose a greater risk than the larger particles ( >1 micrometre) due to 
their smaller size, higher surface to volume ratio and associated increased chemical reactivity of the nano-sized group. For example, sorption of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to nano-polystyrene was shown to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude stronger than   to micro-polyethylene (Velzeboer et al. 2014; see also Chapter 4.4.2). Particles at the smaller end of the size spectrum (nano scales) have also been shown to cross cell in controlled laboratory experiments. Experimental evidence with rodents shows that microplastics > 1 
micrometre may reach the blood circulation via lymph, but cannot penetrate deeply into organs (Bouwmeester et al. 2015; GESAMP et al. 2015). They might cause local effects on the gut epithelium, the immune system, inflammation, encapsulation (fibrosis) and cell dam -age (Bouwmeester et al. 2015; GESAMP et al. 2015; see also Chapter 4.4.3). Unlike microplastics, nano -
plastics may reach and penetrate all organs, includ -
ing the placenta and brain (Bouwmeester et al. 2015; see also GESAMP, 2015). It is important to investigate potential impacts through food consumption (Hollman et al. 2013) as accumulation of ingested microplastics through the food chain and the consumption of sea -
food has not yet been demonstrated as harmful. 
Chemicals (i.e. additives and monomers) inherent in 
microplastics or chemicals sorbed and transported by microplastics (Chapter 4) may contribute to human health impacts. The toxicity of some of their compo -
nents to humans, especially plasticizers and additives (Flint et al. 2012; Oehlmann et al. 2009) and the possible leaching of poisonous chemicals, may be considered as a potential human health hazard. However, on the basis of the available evidence, which is predomi -
nantly based on larger sized microplastics, it appears that adhering persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and leachable additives of ingested microplastics will have a minor impact on contaminant exposure to fish (Bouwmeester et al. 2015). Due to the absence of knowledge on nanoplastic exposure to humans, their potential chemical risk, especially after translocation into tissues and cells remains unknown.

*Note different methods have been used in each of these studies, which will affect the ability to detect microplastics 
Fishing effort (Watson et al. 2013), aquaculture  
production (FAO 2014) and microplastic distribution 
(this study) all exhibit significant regional variations in intensity, suggesting that there may be specific geographical regions where the likelihood of  
microplastics posing a risk to seafood is greater. For example, Asia has both high fish catches and aquaculture  
production (FAO  2014) and higher estimated micro-plastic abundance (GESAMP 2015). Temperature will also play a role as there is a correlation between certain pathogens and temperature (e.g. Vibrio) . A rigorous 
risk assessment that accounts for all of the pathways and factors that influence exposure, impact and their variation geographically would be instrumental in  
identifying hot-spots where any negative impacts are most likely to surface first.
5.5 C onclusions, knowledge gaps and 
research priorities
5.5.1  Conclusions
T
he study of microplastics is in its infancy; however, 
information on microplastic distribution, concentration 
and impacts is increasing rapidly. Plastics used in fish -
eries and aquaculture sectors can degrade into micro -
plastics that can then contaminate seafood products. Our current level of knowledge indicates there is poten -
tial for both ecological and economic impacts that could extend to fisheries and aquaculture sectors. The impacts of the consumption of microplastics by food fish are unknown; however, studies on non-commercial species suggest microplastics have the potential to GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  79
negatively affect organism health. Consequently, there 
is concern that microplastics may affect food security and food safety. In order to properly assess the risk of microplastics to organismal and human health further research is needed as outlined below. Several recom -
mendations are described in Chapter 10 that focus on proactive risk reduction initiatives relevant to fisheries and aquaculture. 
5.5.2
 Knowledge gaps
T
he ingestion of microplastics and associated impacts 
have been documented for a wide range of marine 
species; however, very little is known about the fate of microplastics ingested by commercial species and seafood products (e.g. fishmeal). Further, while the ingestion of microplastic by fish has been documented extensively we don’t know how long and if the plastic is retained in the gut and/or if it is translocated to other tissues that may be consumed by humans. These are the most pressing knowledge gaps that must be addressed in order to determine how and if microplas -
tics pose a risk for food safety and potentially food security. Little evidence is available on the cumulative impacts of microplastics with other stressors, such as increased water temperature, and the degree to which chemicals associated with plastics add to the overall body burden of marine species.5.5.3

Key points
The socio-economic impacts of marine plastic are growing with the ongoing increase in plastic in the marine envi -
ronment. There is mounting concern, globally and by sector, about the increasing cost both of inaction and action 
needed across the value chain.
Economics  
1.
  Whilst 
the benefits of action against macroplastics often outweigh their costs, downstream clean-up 
actions focusing on microplastics are unlikely to be cost-effective, underlining the need for upstream 
preventative measures on sources.
2.
  Many 
sectors of the economy are sources of microplastics either directly (releases of primary microplas-
tics) or indirectly (macroplastics breaking down to microplastics). 
3.
  It is in the inter
ests of those employed in many sectors of the economy to find strategies to reduce marine 
litter, as this can help reduce social and economic burdens. Examples include: tourism and recreation, aquaculture and fisheries, and shipping.
Social aspects
1.
  Citizen consumption of goods and services, personal habits (e.g. use of r
eusable bags and packaging) 
and waste practices (littering, waste separation) are key drivers of marine litter.
2.
  Mitigating 
marine litter can benefit communities, support long term livelihoods (e.g. links to fisheries or 
tourism), well-being (e.g. linked to recreation) and social cohesion (e.g. sense of belonging to a clean environment).
3.
  Human health impacts can be mitigated  by r
emoving waste that can harbour pathogens or accumulate 
pools of water that host insects which are vectors for diseases, like denge fever. 
4.
  A range of factors influence per
ceptions and behaviour, such as: cultural norms, gender, social standing, 
education level and economic status. Accounting for these in the design and implementation of measures to encourage behaviour change may result in longer lasting, more effective and lower-cost solutions.
6.1 L essons from the first assessment
In regards to socio-economics, the first assessment reflected heavily on new research on macro debris and the general risk perception literature and applied these insights to microplastics. Specifically it reviewed the research on public perceptions and the importance and challenges of understanding risk perception. It also looked at the social impacts of microplastics and the role of individuals and groups and regional factors, including barriers and actions towards potential solu -
tions. 
The first assessment concluded that people see the 
health of the ocean as important and that pollution (more generally) is a key problem for the environment and for users of the marine environment. Microplastics specifically were seldom noted in surveys looking at individuals’ perceptions, suggesting that the public had little awareness about microplastics. Using printed and digital media to infer public interest and concern, the increasing presence of news articles, microplastic-related searches online, and social media campaigns implied a growing trend that requires further investiga -
tion. Social and socio-ecological impacts of marine debris more generally were also identified, re-empha -
sizing the urgency of addressing this wider issue; as well as acknowledging the role of individual, group and geographical/cross-cultural differences. 
The first report concluded positively on how people 
can be part of the solution through public engagement and formal and informal education, but emphasized the numerous research gaps. The four main areas identi -
fied as needing attention were:
1)
 S
ocial research on a) current knowledge & under -
standing, b) perceived risks of microplastics, and c) the 
associated consequences of microplastics to society
2)
 G
reater geographical coverage (research outside 
of Americas & Europe)3)
 I
nvestigation of the economic impacts of micro -
plastics, in terms of cost-benefit to forecast future 
effects in response to any changes in microplastic use/input
4)
 Pr
omote the collection and evaluation of exam -
ples of public engagement programmes (e.g. citizen 
science; beach cleans) in terms of their effects on per -
ceptions and actions, including longitudinal follow-ups.
This new GESAMP chapter develops these points fur -
ther, as well as presenting more insights on practical 
solutions – what can we do and what are the impacts of action and inaction.
6.2 I ntroducing the plastics economy
An overview of the flow of plastic through the economy is presented in Figure 6.1. It indicates the flow of plastics to consumers via goods and services, and to the wider environment, either under controlled waste GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  81
disposal or via release as waste to land and directly 
or indirectly to the sea. Much of the work published on the economics of marine plastic debris concerns macro-debris and is summarized in detail in an unpub -
lished report prepared for UNEA by IEEP. The structure of Chapter 6 broadly follows the schematic, starting with a focus on producer responsibility and measures to address the problem (Section 6.3). Three sectors are then looked at in depth; Section 6.4 focuses on fisheries and aquaculture, 6.5 on shipping, and 6.6 on tourism and recreation. Next, the chapter discusses the cost of inaction and action for end-users (i.e. consumer behaviour, 6.7) and the waste management sector (6.8). 
Drawing on the behavioural sciences, Section 6.9 pro -
vides an overview of some factors influential in encour -
aging long-term behaviour change, identifying the 
social costs and benefits of highlighted actions at differ -
ent stages within the lifecycle of plastics (Sections 6.3 to 6.8). Collaborations across stakeholders on solutions are explored in 6.9, and Section 6.10 presents the con -
clusions, knowledge gaps and priorities.

6.3 P roducer responsibility
6.3.1  Initiatives and the cost of action to addr ess 
microplastics
There is a range of actions that producers can take, 
and have taken, to contribute to reducing or prevent -
ing microplastics entering the marine environment. They can occur across the product chain – from raw material use to production processes, quality of plastic produced, and product design. They can include initia -
tives characteristic of a more circular economy that facilitates reuse, repair, re-manufacture and recycle plastic (Figure 6.1). The need to establish a more cir -
cular plastic production cycle is discussed in more detail in UNEP (2016). Producers can also help in information provision to help intermediate consumers (i.e. other sectors) and final consumers (i.e. citizens) make informed choices. Finally, take-back schemes can encourage wider engagement (by both produc -
ers and consumers) in waste collection. Examples are given below. 
In terms of their actual products, one of the main ways 
for producers to prevent marine litter is through sus -
tainable product design. Products can be developed that are more recyclable so that they can easily be captured at the end of their lifecycle, or be designed with an end-of-life use already in mind. In many cases multi-use products are preferable to single-use ones (e.g. re-usable bags rather than single-use plastic bags) since they are less likely to be disposed of immediately. Voluntary initiatives involving groups of actors (such as the Beat the Microbead campaign) may provide motivation to act (e.g. producer initiatives to remove microbeads from personal care products), since they ensure that there are several organizations working towards the same goal. 
Several examples of these various types of actions are 
included in Box 6.1.
The producers of waste that may become marine litter 
represent one sector that can bear the economic costs. In terms of environmental economics, the creation of marine litter is facilitated because the marginal price of goods on the market (and of disposable plastics in particular) fails to reflect the full marginal cost to soci -
ety of producing that good: in short, marine litter has an external cost to society that is not adequately borne by the waste producer (or consumer). It is also easy for some waste producers to ‘free-ride’ (i.e. not contribute to litter prevention/clean-up costs whilst others do).82  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANBox 6.1 Examples of producer initiatives that can help to reduce marine litter
In June 2015, a number of large UK brands and retailers announced their commitments to phase out non-biode -
gradable plastic microbeads from their own-brand cosmetics and personal care products. The commitments were 
made public on a voluntary basis through the Beat the Microbead campaign (launched in 2012 by the Plastic Soup Foundation) and the Good Scrub Guide (Fauna & Flora International (FFI) and the Marine Conservation Society). In parallel, legislation has been adopted to ban plastic microbeads from a large sub-set of personal care products, including in the United States and Canada. 
The Operation Clean Sweep programme, an international initiative of the plastics industry, aims to prevent the loss of 
plastic pellets, flakes and powder to the marine environment through good housekeeping and containment practices by all parts of the plastics industry (producers, transporters and processors). A manual has been developed present -
ing best practice procedures to prevent, contain and clean up spills and losses of pellets, to make employees aware of both their responsibilities and how they can ensure they meet them. Implementing the measures in the manual will of course have cost implications; these costs are funded by those companies pledging their participation in Operation Clean Sweep, but no details are available publically on costs. 
Extended producer responsibility (EPR)
One instrument that can be used to put responsibility 
on the producer is EPR, whereby a producer is made financially and/or logistically responsible for the post-consumer (i.e. waste) stage of a product’s lifecycle, as encouraged by Surfers Against Sewage in the UK that currently have a Return to Offender campaign.
8 This 
concept has been widely implemented in EU and OECD countries, and in recent years emerging economies in Asia, Africa and South America have also begun devel -
oping EPR programmes (OECD, 2014). With regards to marine litter, perhaps the most important waste stream that should be addressed by EPR is packaging, since it forms a significant proportion of marine litter. Plastics used for packaging were estimated to require 78 million tons of material in 2013 (WEF, 2016), with a marginal 2 % returning to remanufacture. Although 14 % 
was estimated to be recovered, 4 % is lost in processing 
and 8 % downcycled to low quality goods. The remain -
ing 86 % goes to landfills or incinerators, or ends up in 
the environment. 
Food wrappers and beverage containers (and caps) are 
regularly featured in the top ten most frequently found items during marine litter surveys; together these items comprised 31 % of all items found during the Ocean 
Conservancy’s 2013 International Coastal Cleanup. As a result of EPR for packaging waste, 64 % of waste 
packaging (including composting for biodegradable packaging) was recycled in the 27 EU Member States in 2011, and 77 % was recovered (including incineration 
with energy recovery). In Japan, the level of recycling of containers and packaging waste increased by 27% between 1997 and 2000 (OECD, 2014). The fees paid by producers to EPR schemes are mostly used to cover, or contribute to, the cost of collection and treatment of waste packaging, and only minimally to cover clean-up of litter.
EPR can also be used to promote environmentally 
friendly design, which helps to increase recycling and reduce waste. For example, implementation of the  2006 revision of the Packaging Recycling Act in Japan contributed to a significant switch by produc -
ers from green PET bottles to clear ones with green labels. This helped reduce the cost of collection by removing the need for green bottles to be collected 
8 http://www.sas.org.uk/campaign/return-to-offender/ separately and was also attractive to industry given the higher value of clear bottles. A ‘bonus-malus’ scheme was also introduced by the French organization Eco-Emballages that strongly penalizes (by up to 100 % of 
their fee) producers that place non-recyclable packag -
ing on the market, whilst reducing the fee by up to 8 % 
for producers who reduce the weight or volume of their packaging (OECD 2014).
In Chile a new form of EPR has been proposed that dif -
fers from others in that it puts the burden of recovery 
on specific brands. For example, a producer of bever -
ages bottled in plastic must recover a percentage of their bottles from consumers and the environment. This has two key motivators that can drive innovative design. First, producers of products and packaging will be incentivized to use biodegradable materials rather than plastic for single-use, throw away items, realizing that recovery from remote regions may be too expensive to warrant using plastic in these applica -
tions. Second, once producers recover their percent -
age quota of their plastic product, they must deal with it in some way. Designing their product for end-of-life material recovery and remanufacture is incentivized because the brand is responsible for dealing with their material directly (OECD 2014). 
Additional actions may of course be taken by produc -
ers to address the problems of marine litter; these typi -
cally address downstream waste rather than upstream 
product design. The role of the waste management sector is presented in more detail in Section 6.7.
6.3.2
 Benefits of action by producers
E
xamples of producer initiatives and their benefits are 
presented in the box below. These are downstream 
activities, dealing with final marine plastic waste. Whilst these initiatives illustrate the utility of such action, they only address a small fraction of (marine) plastic waste. Even if the quantitative effects on marine litter are very small it is possible that there are benefits in terms of raising awareness. Up-stream mitigation and recycling measures are likely to be more effective in reducing marine litter, and perhaps less powerful for public awareness.
There are also a number of initiatives where socio-
economic benefits and/or value are generated from collected marine litter, whether in terms of employment GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  83
created, collected recyclable materials (e.g. plastics) 
sold or upcycled products sold. Furthermore, value can also be generated by collecting and recycling plastic before it becomes marine litter, and often this results in higher values than those obtained from marine litter, given the higher quality (and hence value) of plastic that has not been degraded or contaminated in the marine environment (see Section 6.7).
Box 6.2 Examples of producer initiatives to address marine litter
Bureo Skateboards has created a skateboard deck (the ‘Minnow’ skateboard) made entirely from recycled fishing 
nets. This has been done through Net Positiva, a collection and recycling programme for commercial fishing nets in Chile, which was launched in 2013. Through Net Positiva, Bureo Skateboards ‘harvest’ the waste nets which are then melted down at a recycling plant in Santiago to be made into skateboards. To date, Bureo have recycled 10.8 m
2 of 
fishing net; each skateboard deck uses over 2.8 m2 of fishing net.
Interface Carpets, together with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and yarn supplier Aquafil, created the Net-Works programme that incentivizes net recovery from beaches in the Philippines.  These nets are remanufactured into carpet squares.  The Net-Works programme in the Philippines (Danajon Bank and Bantayan Islands) has to date collected 77,792 kg of discarded fishing nets, 51,934 kg of which have already been absorbed into Interface’s supply chain. The money from net purchases go into small community banks that provide access to finance (e.g. micro-insurance, savings and loans) for 358 local residents. It is estimated that the funds provided through Net-Works com -
munity banks to date would be enough to pay for 268,382 meals. In 2015, Net-Works expanded into a third Philippine collection hub (Northern Iloilo), and also established a programme in Lake Ossa in Cameroon.

Conclusions
There are costs associated with inaction; one esti -
mate suggests that environmental damage to marine ecosystems caused by plastics is $13 billion per year  (UNEP 2014). While producers implicitly share some responsibility for the cost of inaction, they will not however incur any direct costs of inaction related to marine litter unless EPR applies and they are there -
fore financially and/or logistically responsible for their products at the end of their useful life. Still, in many locations, once a product is produced and sold, it is no longer the concern of producers. This means that pro -
ducers frequently do not have a cost-related incentive to take action on marine litter. 
There is little data available on the costs of action 
by producers to prevent and tackle marine litter. Participation in initiatives such as the plastics indus -
try’s Operation Clean Sweep or voluntary commit -
ments to phase out plastic microbeads from cosmetics and personal care products will of course have some related costs, but information on costs has not been found. It is therefore challenging to find information on the cost to producers of actions that help to address marine litter.6.4 F isheries and aquaculture
6.4.1  Introduction
T
he fishery sector is responsible for and negative -
ly affected by plastic debris, predominantly macro -
plastics that degrade into microplastics (Figure 6.1). Consequently, when reviewing the cost of inaction and action of tackling microplastics, it is fundamental not to overlook this aspect.
Lost and discarded fishing gear poses a signifi -
cant impact on ecosystems and wildlife populations 
and individuals, which may translate into a loss of catch. Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fish -
ing gear  (ALDFG) can end up indiscriminately catch -
ing target and non-target fish for a long time after it is lost at sea (a phenomenon known as ghost fishing) (Macfadyen et al. 2009; Brown 2005; UNEP 2009). With time, and the action of sunlight, waves and sea currents, they degrade into micro- and nanoplastics, which can also have negative impacts on wildlife, con -
taminate commercial fish and shellfish and potentially affect human health (see Sections 6.3 and 6.6).

6.4.2
 Economic impacts of marine litter on
 
fisheries
The impact of marine litter on fisheries is due to the 
damage to fishing vessels and equipment and to the reduction of potential catches and/or sales result -
ing from macro- and micro-plastics. In regards to macroplastics, impacts are largely due to floating objects affecting engine cooling systems and becom -
ing entangled in propellers (McIlgorm et al. 2011; Takehama  1990). A summary of available information on the economic impact of macro-debris on the fisher -
ies and aquaculture sector is provided by UNEP (2016). 
In regards to microplastics, there may be an impact on 
fish stocks due to exposure through the gills or inges -
tion. Microplastics can also be transferred through the food web from one trophic level to the next, increasing the risk of exposure in a diversity of fish and shellfish products. The impact of microplastics on commercial fish species is still relatively unknown (see Chapter 5). 
Microplastics can be a vector of transport of chemicals 
into marine organisms, including additives, mono -
mers and by-products contained in plastic particles and organic chemicals and metals from surrounding seawater. For this reason, microplastics may have an impact on wildlife and human health (see Chapter 5 for more information). Concerns about this issue may cause a reduction in demand for the seafood products (see Box 6.3 for an estimation of the related costs in the UK). For example, if people perceive a risk or are unsure of the risks associated with seafood, they will have lower intentions to consume it (Boase 2015). As such, widespread concern could have major impacts on fisheries (see discussion on risk perception in Chapter 6.8 and GESAMP 2015). 
Box 6.3 Potential economic losses to the UK oyster and mussel aquaculture sector due to microplastics
A model developed by van der Meulen et al. (2014) calculated a yearly loss of up to 0.7 % of the annual income for the 
aquaculture sector in the UK due to microplastics. These costs relate to the impacts of microplastics on the mussels 
and oysters (chemical and physical effects) and in turn on human health (through the consumption of seafood), which can lead to reduced consumer demand and hence socio-economic costs through loss of sales.
6.4.3
 Cost of action to addr
ess microplastics
Marine litter produced by the fishery sector, which degrades into microplastics over time, can be reduced using a combination of preventative and clean-up measures (Macfadyen 2009). Preventative measures aim to avoid the occurrence of marine litter. Examples include marking fishing gear to identify ownership, the provision of low-cost/free and easy-to-use collection facilities in ports, schemes for fishers to collect marine litter (Box 6.4), and spatial zoning to make other marine users aware of the presence of fishing gear. 
Clean-up measures aim to remove marine litter from 
the sea. They include the use of on-board technol -
ogy to enable location of gear (e.g. side scan sonar for sea-bed surveys) and gear retrieval programmes (Macfadyen 2009). Even though it would be impractical, dangerous, and too expensive to remove all ALDFG, programmes aimed at removing it in the most sensitive areas and in areas with demonstrated high loss rates would help address the problem. The costs related to ALDFG retrieval programmes may differ consider -
ably, depending on the specific characteristics of the geographical areas, scope and duration. For example, Wiig (2005) reports estimates ranging from $65/tonne in Taiwan Province of China, to $25,000/tonne in the Hawaii Islands. Table 6.2 summarizes some estimates of costs related to ALDFG retrieval programmes.
6.4.4
 
Conclusions
Marine litter (both macroplastic and microplastics) may 
translate into a loss of catches and/or sales for fish -
ers and therefore a cost for the sector. Debris in the sea also results in costs for the fishery sector due to damage to fishing vessels. A number of policies can be used to address marine litter, including preventative and clean-up measures. The related costs will depend on local specificities, but comparing their cost to the cost of inaction will certainly provide a good argument to strengthen the policies already in place and to imple -
ment new ones. Assessing the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of such policies is not an easy task because of the global character of marine litter. However, efforts should be made to estimate the monetary costs (e.g. loss of fish sales) and non-monetary costs (e.g. poten -
tial health risks) associated with microplastics. 
Unlike other sectors addressed in this study, assessing 
the costs of marine litter for fisheries does not need additional use of monetary valuation methodologies, as fish already have a market value. This kind of analysis needs evidence regarding the changes in wildlife popu -GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  85
lations due to microplastics. Ecological studies should 
be complemented with surveys of fishers in different areas, investigating the economic loss from marine debris, including due to time lost to clean-up efforts, damage to fishing vessels/aquaculture installations and loss of catches and sales.In many cases, such analysis will show that the costs of policies addressing marine litter are outweighed by the benefits in terms of increased income/reduced costs for fishers, in addition to shipping, tourist operators and other related sectors. For microplastics there is as yet too little information on economic costs of impacts to be able to draw a definitive conclusion.
Box 6.4 Initiatives involving commercial fishers for marine litter collection 
Using financial incentives, South KoreaIn 2002, the city of Incheon (Korea) established a financial incentive programme that rewarded fishers for collecting 
marine debris with a payment of $5 per 40 litre bag. The cost was estimated to be significantly lower than the cost of collection by the authorities of derelict fishing gear, i.e. a minimum of $48 per 40 litre bag (Cho 2005). Inspired by this experience, the Korean Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime affairs has implemented a similar incentive pro -
gramme since 2003 with a budget of $5.2 million per year between 2009 and 2013, and covered 80 % of the related 
costs, the rest being covered by local governments. The programme collects an average of 6,200 tonnes of debris per year. Both financial incentives are still in place.
Fishing for litter, BelgiumIn Belgium, it is not uncommon for fishers to find items of marine litter, generally a few kilograms with each catch. 
In some cases, trawler nets bring in very large items such as fridges and truck tyres. Stichting voor Duurzame Visserijontwikkeling (SDVO), the Belgian foundation for Sustainable Fishery Development, has a litter campaign called Fishing For Litter. It encourages Belgian fisherman to collect the waste they pull up in on-board containers provided by SDVO. SDVO organizes the collection of this waste in all three Belgian fishing ports, and sorts the waste for recy -
clability. The Fishing For Litter project is a voluntary cost-sharing scheme. Uptake is 60 % amongst Belgian fishers, 
who pay a fee depending on the size of their vessel. Although free riders exist, the project covers its costs.
[Source: Interview with representatives of SDVO and Waste Free Oceans, June 2015]
Box 6.5 Case study summary – Fishing litter in KoreaAccording to Jang et al. (2014c), 48 % of the marine litter found in Korean seas is derelict fishing gear. It is estimated 
that 60 % of the fishing nets used in Korea are abandoned in the sea (Jang et al 2014b). Recent surveys show that EPS 
represents the most abundant debris item found on Korean beaches, covering a range of sizes from microplastics to 
macroplastic (Hong et al. 2014; Heo et al. 2013; Jang et al. 2014a; Lee et al. 2013). 
Derelict fishing gear has a great impact on wildlife (Lee et al. 2015; Hong et al. 2013), which translates into losses for 
the fishery and aquaculture sector (Cho 2005), as well as reduced revenues for the tourism sector (Jang et al. 2014b) and numerous maritime accidents (Cho 2005).
In order to address the problem, the Korean Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries put in place strategies in 1999 
to remove marine debris. The 2nd National Plan for Marine Litter Management (2014 to 2018) includes not only a clean-up programme, but also a survey of the status of marine debris, preventative measures to reduce the discharge of debris from land-based sources to coastal areas and the development of equipment and facilities for deep-sea survey, recycling and environmentally friendly disposal of collected material (Jung et al. 2010). In addition, the Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries has provided financial support to local governments to install EPS compactors, and to fishers to buy high-density buoys which degrade less readily into microplastics (Lee et al. 2015). Also, in 2009 the Ministry of the Environment established debris management and cost-sharing agreements in the five major Korean rivers with the local governments that share the same watershed, which resulted in local governments in upstream areas transferring funds to those located downstream for clean-up (Jang et al. 2014c). Finally, the city of Incheon and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries have put in place incentive programmes that remunerate fishers to collect marine litter.
The level of effectiveness and cost-efficiency of these policies is still to be evaluated through regular surveys to 
monitor the sources, type and location of marine litter, to assess the trend over time. Also, the costs of the different programmes in place should be analysed, and if possible compared with the observed results, to assess whether the available budget is used in the most efficient way and, if not, to suggest improvements. As an example of this kind of approach, Hong et al. (2015) compared the cost efficiency of clean-up by ships, fishers’ incentives and floating reception barge (FB) programmes and suggested governmental policies should mainly focus on preventative actions such as FB.

6.5 Shipping 
6.5.1  Economic impacts of marine litter on the  
sector
Commercial shipping represents an important sec -
tor for marine litter. Commercial shipping is also a 
source of, and is impacted by marine litter (Table 6.3). Estimates suggest that shipping is responsible for between 12 %  (IMO 2012) and 20 % (EMSA 2013) of 
global discharges of waste at sea. Complex interna -
tional, regional and national maritime laws provide a legislative framework, which forbids the dumping of plastic waste at sea. However, both accidental and deliberate waste dumping continues to drive socio-economic impacts, which bring costs upon the sector (Newman 2015).
The process of generating marine litter and its pres -
ence in general bring costs to the commercial shipping 
sector. The main costs are associated with collisions with marine litter that can result in accidental loss of cargos; and indirect costs relating to operational costs, disruption of service and public image. However, these impacts generally do not tend to stem from micro or nanoplastics, but from larger items.

 Cost of action to addr
ess microplastics
In order to adhere to maritime laws regarding waste 
there are a number of actions the shipping sector can carry out on-board vessels and on land. The effectiveness of waste management on-board and at port reception facilities largely dictates the levels of marine litter originating from the shipping industry (Sherrington 2014; Seas At Risk 2011). In addition, there are sporadic accidental losses of cargo from ships. For example, after Typhoon Vicente on 24 July 2012, over 150 tonnes of plastic pellets were blown into the sea and were washed up on southern Hong Kong coasts. Operational discharges from ships may also add to microplastic abundance in the ocean. Strategies for commercial shipping vessels to collect waste may also be considered, although are yet to proceed beyond prototype experiments.

9 The creation of the world’s largest solar boat and the first 
to circumnavigate the globe, the MS Tûranor represents one 
example in efforts to explore how ships could engage in clean-up operations (Lombardo 2013) 6.5.3  Conclusions
T
he socio-economics of marine litter for commercial 
shipping reflects the scale of this industry and its ten -
dency to minimize operational costs. The data on litter 
originating from ships suggests that shipping continues to contribute significantly to global levels of marine litter. The costs associated with marine litter suggest that the sector should make further efforts to reduce its impact on the marine environment. 
Raising awareness about the costs of marine litter to 
the shipping sector could support better practices. Costs are associated with loss of cargo, collisions with waste, and legal action for dumping. Due to the dependency of global supply chains on logistics from shipping, the costs of disruption to services are consid -
erable. The shipping and ports sectors, with appropri -
ate governance, could be encouraged to develop and utilize improved waste management infrastructures on-board, improve port reception facilities, and take steps to reduce cargo losses at sea.GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  87
6.6 T ourism and recreation
6.6.1  Introduction
S
ocio-economic impacts on the tourism sector can be 
significant, particularly in areas that are heavily focused 
on coastal tourism which relies on a clean and pristine environment to attract visitors. The increased preva -
lence of marine litter reduces the aesthetic value of a location and affects recreational opportunities such as beach activities, surfing, fishing and diving. This leads to reduced visitors, which in turn leads to a loss of revenue and jobs in the tourism sector. Microplastic contamination requires costly clean-up activities and may pose health and safety risks to visitors. In paral -
lel, the tourism industry generates waste and marine litter, which is especially concerning in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) that lack the necessary infra -
structure for waste management.

 Impacts of marine litter on the sector
T
he visible presence of marine litter has an impact on 
the aesthetic value of beaches and shorelines. This visual dis-amenity can undermine some of the benefits associated with coastal environments (e.g. improved physical health, reduced stress, improved concentra -
tion (White et al. 2013)) and may be a reason not to visit certain coastal areas (Box 6.6). There is a strong relationship between the visible presence of marine lit -
ter in the water and recreational use (Fanshawe 2002). For example, the presence of marine debris affects recreational activities such as diving and snorkel -
ling, fouling propellers and jet intakes of recreational boaters and affecting recreational fishers in terms of the contamination of catch, restricted catch, dam -
aged gear etc. Marine litter has also been found to be harmful to visitors’ psychological well-being, as when witnessing litter on the coast people felt strong nega -
tive emotions (e.g. sadness, anger) and it was seen to diminish the restorative qualities of the environment (Wyles et al. 2015).
Box 6.6 Examples of how marine litter influences beach choice 
California, USAA study of 31 beaches in Orange County, California, USA (Leggett et al. 2014) showed that marine debris had a sig -
nificant impact on how residents chose beaches to visit. The study found that a 50 % reduction in marine litter could 
generate $67 million in benefits to residents over a three-month period. It also found that reducing marine debris 
by 75% from six beaches near the outflow of the Los Angeles River would benefit users by $5/trip and increase visi -
tors by 43 % leading to $53 million in benefits.
Barbados
Beach litter has potential economic costs in terms of adverse effects on the probability of tourists returning to a par -
ticular destination (Schuhmann 2011). A survey of tourists in Barbados examined the relationship between the quality 
and cleanliness of beaches and the probability of return visits. The results of the survey indicate that the amount of litter seen and tourist perceptions of beach quality are significantly related to the probability of return visits, particu -
larly for first-time visitors. 
In addition to being unsightly, marine debris can pose health risks and hazards for divers, recreational boat -
ers, fishers and other coastal visitors. Medical and per -
sonal hygiene items (e.g. disposable nappies, sanitary products) contaminate some locations. 
Marine litter discourages visitors from going to beaches. 
Reduced numbers of coastal visitors leads to lost revenues to the tourism sector. This leads to a loss of revenue and jobs in the local and regional economy. This can have short-term (e.g. where a specific natu -
ral incident such as a flood or tsunami washes up marine debris on a beach) and/or long-term impacts (e.g. where consistent levels of marine debris damages the reputation and image of the area as a tourist des -
tination thus discouraging private sector investment in new hotel developments (McIlgorm et al. 2011). These impacts can be quite significant in certain cases, par -
ticularly where local economies are heavily dependent on tourism. Hawaii and the Maldives are facing declines 88  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANin tourist numbers and associated revenues due to 
marine debris, particularly plastics that threaten to affect the reputation of islands as sought-after tourist destinations (Thevenon et al. 2014). Some studies pro -vide quantitative estimates of the costs to the tourism sector of marine litter – see Box 6.7 for some examples. There is no clear evidence yet on the impacts of micro-plastics specifically on tourism and recreation.
Box 6.7 Estimated costs of marine litter to the tourism sector 
Goeje Island, South KoreaA period of heavy rainfall which led to marine debris washing up on the beaches of Goeje Island (South Korea) is 
estimated to have led to $27.7 to 35.1 million (KRW 29,217 to 36,984 million) lost revenue in 2011 from over 500,000 fewer visitors. The lost expense/revenue per visitor was estimated to be $66 (2013 $) (Jang et al. 2014a).
APEC regionDamage by marine debris to the tourism sector in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region has been 
estimated to cost $622 Million (McIlgorm 2009).
South-west SwedenThe presence of beach litter on the Skagerrak coast of Bohuslan (Sweden) decreases tourism by between 1 % to 5 %, 
equating to an estimated annual loss of approximately $22.5 million and 150 man-years of work to the local commu -
nity. Local clean-up efforts are estimated to cost approximately $1.4 million (GBP 937,000) per annum. Thus, the total 
cost to the local economy is around $24 million (GBP 16 million) per year (Fanshawe and Everard 2002).
UKVan der Meulen et al. (2014) estimated that annual costs to the tourism sector in certain sample regions of the UK 
could range from $2.3 million (GBP 1.4 million) to almost $823 million (GBP 500 million) in the 2010 to 2100 period. The study identifies Devon and Norfolk as relatively vulnerable regions. Total regional beach cleaning costs are projected to range between $188,735 and $2.5 million (GBP 100,000 and 1.5 million) per year. 
6.6.3
 Cost of action to addr
ess microplastics
Addressing marine litter in the tourism sector requires preventative and responsive measures, which have associated costs and responsibilities borne by different actors. For most municipalities, the potential impact of marine litter on tourism is the main motivation for removing beach litter, often providing a more powerful incentive for action than legislation (Mouat et al. 2010). The costs of clean-up activities associated with litter -
ing by coastal visitors can fall on local actors such as municipalities or private actors such as beach manag -
ers and hotel personnel. Given the importance of the tourism sector in many economies, there is a strong incentive to both public and private actors to ensure their beaches and marine environments are kept clean (McIlgorm et al. 2009).
Clean-up costs can be expensive, and in some cases 
pose an undue burden on local authorities. For exam -
ple, the estimated coastline clean-up cost for the Ventanillas municipality in Perú is double the annual budget of the municipality for all public cleaning (Alfaro, 2006 cited in UNEP 2009). Revenues from taxes applied on the tourism sector and other recreational users of coastal areas (e.g. car park charges near beaches, fees on recreational fishers) can contribute to the costs of coastal clean-up, waste collection and treatment, helping to alleviate pressure on the budgets of local authorities. The willingness of tourists to pay such taxes is dependent on several factors including the age and income of tourists, and whether there is a link between the tax and litter control (Oosterhuis et al. 2014). In some cases, clean-up activities are moti -
vated by the need to uphold certain certification stan -
dards and voluntary eco-labels and awards (Box 6.8).
At the same time, certain clean-up activities can have a 
negative environmental impact, e.g. mechanical beach cleaning can disturb nesting areas and remove compo -
nents of the food chain (Surfers Against Sewage 2014). In addition, some clean-up activities may contribute to microplastics in the environment by breaking down macro litter rather than removing it.GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  89
Box 6.8 Eco-labels and certification programmes to support prevention and clean-up activities
Blue Flag ProgrammeThe Blue Flag Programme is a voluntary eco-label scheme, which sets standards for water quality, environmental 
management, information provision, safety and services. The need to maintain Blue Flag status has been an impor -
tant factor motivating clean-up efforts in countries across the world. For example, a survey in the UK found that 46.3 % 
of municipalities removed marine litter to ensure that beaches in their area meet the criteria for the Blue Flag Awards (Mouat et al. 2010). The potential impact of microplastics on water quality and potential reputational risk to Blue Flag beaches was calculated to cost between 0.09 % and 3.4 % of tourism revenues in selected coastal regions in the UK 
with a business-as-usual tourism revenue of GBP 14.75 billion per year (Van der Meulen et al. 2014). 
Green Coast Award, IrelandSome municipalities undertake beach clean-up activities to pursue awards such as Quality Coast Awards, the Green 
Coast Awards and the Seaside Awards, relevant for smaller coastal resorts. For example in Ireland, the Green Coast Award is awarded to beaches that have a beach management plan in place and community engagement to meet standards in the Bathing Water Directive but do not have the infrastructure to achieve Blue Flag status. 
Bandera Azul Ecológica, Costa RicaIn Costa Rica, the Blue Flag Ecological Program (Bandera Azul Ecológica) engages coastal communities in protec -
tion, clean-up and maintenance efforts. The award is granted annually based on performance against certain criteria 
covering water quality, waste management, facilities, safety and environmental education, with monthly monitoring to ensure continued maintenance.
Different measures, other than clean-ups, are likely to attract varying degrees of public and political accep -
tance. For example, in a survey of beach visitors in Chile, the two most supported solutions to the problem of beach litter were community-level environmental education programmes and fines (Eastman 2013). Certain regulatory measures such as bans and fines may be politically sensitive to introduce and their enforcement challenging (i.e. requiring resources and legal capability). However, support could be built through targeted campaigns (i.e. creating peer pres -
sure). For example, in the US, despite initial polarization of local communities to bans on smoking on beaches, people now generally support the smoking bans (Ariza and Leatherman 2012). 
Box 6.9 Case study summary – marine litter in Hawaii
Marine debris is considered an important issue in Hawaii and has attracted significant attention from policy makers, 
private actors, NGOs, academics and the public. Land-based sources include improper waste disposal practices, tourism and recreational activities such as coastal recreational fishing. 
Economic impacts include costly clean-up activities with estimates varying from an average $589 t
-1 to clean-up 
marine debris from the coastline (Lamson 2011) to $25 000 t-1 to remove entangled nets from ships at sea in the NWHI 
(Wiig 2005). Other impacts include potential effects on the tourism industry, for example affecting recreational activi-
ties such as diving, posing a health and safety risk to coastal visitors, reducing the attractiveness of certain beaches etc., thus threatening to undermine Hawaii’s reputation as a sought-after tourist destination. Although research on such linkages is limited, impacts could be significant given the importance of tourism to the Hawaiian economy. 
A number of preventative and responsive measures and approaches have been adopted over the years including 
strategic measures such as the Hawaii Marine Debris Action Plan and pioneering legislative approaches at both State and County level such as bans on smoking on beaches and on plastic bags. The public and civil society has been very active in initiating clean-up activities, awareness raising campaigns and educational programmes and contribut -
ing to data collection, monitoring and reporting exercises. 
Despite progress to date and the adoption of a range of innovative measures targeting marine litter, further action 
can be considered (e.g. effective preventative measures in developing countries) and additional research including on the socio-economic impacts of marine debris on specific sectors of the economy, in particular the tourism and fishing industries is needed. Such assessments can inform policy discussions and provide a further motivating factor for effective action on marine litter.

Conclusions
Whilst little is known about microplastics specifically, the tourism sector is significantly affected by marine litter and a major contributor of the debris. The pres -
ence of marine litter can discourage visitors from going to beaches, thus reducing visitor numbers, which leads to lost revenues and jobs in the tourism industry. These impacts can be quite significant in certain cases, par -
ticularly where local economies are heavily dependent on tourism. Moreover, marine debris can pose physical and mental health risks and safety hazards to recre -
ational users of the marine environment. 
The potential impact of marine litter on the tourism 
sector provides a powerful incentive to public and 90  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANprivate actors to keep beaches and marine environ -
ments clean. Responsive measures such as clean-up 
can have significant associated costs and in some cases can pose an undue burden on local authori -
ties. However, the potential impact of marine litter on tourism and the need to uphold certain certification standards, voluntary eco-labels and awards provides a powerful incentive for action by municipalities. Some pressure on the budgets of local authorities can be alle -
viated by sharing clean-up costs with certain private actors (beach managers, hotels), supported by vol -
untary efforts by local community groups and NGOs, and using revenues from taxes on the tourism sector to contribute costs of coastal clean-up and waste collec -
tion and treatment. 
It is also important to address tourism and recreational 
activities as a source of marine litter. A lot of marine lit -
ter is generated from shoreline and recreational activi -
ties (Ocean Conservancy 2010) and there is a need for various preventative measures to address the problem at source. Such measures can include regulation (e.g. smoking bans on beaches in a number of other US states), infrastructure investments (e.g. pier-side recep -
tion facilities for fishing gear in Hawaii, improved waste management practices supported by members of the Roteiros de Charme Hotel Association in Brazil and the Caribbean Alliance for Sustainable Tourism – CAST), product design requirements, targeted awareness rais -
ing and educational activities (e.g. boating safety edu -
cation classes). 
Assessments of the costs of marine litter on the tour -
ism sector and assessment of impacts of tourism 
activities on marine litter are currently limited to small and localized studies. Further research is needed at a larger scale. It is important to measure changes in revenues to the tourism sector and identify to what extent any decline can be attributed to marine debris. There is also a need for further information on the costs (and benefits – economic, environmental and social) of prevention and clean-up activities (undertaken by both public and private actors, voluntary organizations and local community groups), information on health and safety risks from marine debris (in terms of expo -
sure, accidents, mortality) and associated costs of hospitalisation (if relevant) as well as more intangible non-monetary costs (see Section 6.8). An analysis of the role that the tourism industry has on fighting and reducing this phenomenon is also needed. 
6.7 Co nsumer behaviour
6.7.1  Introduction
T
he behaviours of citizens as consumers of goods 
and services are a major contributor to marine litter. Purchases of consumer goods such as plastic bags, plastic beverage containers, cosmetics and health care products that contain microbeads and synthetic textiles creates plastic in the waste stream that may become marine litter. Behaviour includes everyday activities at home and work and periods of recreation and tourism. This section focuses on general consumer behaviour, impacts and measures; the issues of tour -
ism and recreation are addressed in the section above.Citizens may also be at risk from microplastics, e.g. from microplastics in personal care products or fish and shellfish. Citizens are therefore both sources and sinks of marine plastic.
6.7.2
 Impacts of marine litter on citizens
M
arine litter can result in direct and indirect costs due 
to inaction (McIlgorm et al. 2009). Impacts on human 
health and well-being can occur through direct contact with debris which may lead to a direct cost of medical treatment (Hall 2000; ARCADIS 2012). Many of these impacts are not fully understood yet, including their magnitude on a global, regional and local scale, and the ensuing burdens and cost implications. In addition, it is difficult to identify groups that are most affected by marine litter (e.g. in terms of geographical location, age, level of wealth, level of education), due to a lack of study.
The impacts to health and safety from marine litter may 
result from immediate contact with litter, e.g. on beaches or in coastal waters, or indirect contact through the food chain. Microplastics enter the food chain when ingested by marine animals. Once humans consume an animal, e.g. fish, they may ingest microplastic par -
ticles and/or hazardous chemicals associated with it (Engler 2012). In addition, the presence of marine litter on the marine environment may undermine psychologi -
cal benefits provided by nature, especially if the litter is seen to be from the fellow citizens (public litter) rather than a natural by-product of a marine industry such as fishing-related debris (K Wyles, personal communica-tion).
The prevalence of discarded waste, especially plas -
tic objects, in many communities has been linked to 
recent outbreaks and rapid spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as Dengue fever and Zika virus. Plastic waste provides an ideal breeding ground for mos -
quitoes following rainfall. SIDS in the Pacific
10 and 
Caribbean, countries in West Africa and many coun-tries in South and Central America have reported sharp upturns in disease incidence (UNEP 2016). 
Marine litter can also produce indirect costs to human 
beings. Indirect costs can occur in the form of visual impairment of littered beaches, shorelines and marine environments, which lower the recreational value of sites to visitors and local residents and result in addi -
tional costs as visitors relocate to alternative sites (McIlgorm et al. 2011; Birdir et al. 2013). Degradation of marine and coastal ecosystems through litter can lead to further disutility, having negative impact on human health by undermining some of the broader benefits associated with the recreational use of coastal areas (e.g. reduced blood pressure, tension and stress, improved level of concentration) (White et al. 2013). To address this issue, local authorities engage in costly clean-up activities.

6.7.3  Cost of action to addr ess microplastics
It is important to address the many roles of consumers, 
littering contexts and littering pathways, when thinking about actions to address mitigation of microplastic lit -
ter. Ideally, activities will reduce consumption of single-use items and encourage the reuse of plastic products. The following sections provide background about informing and empowering consumers to change their behaviour, as well as looking at prevention of waste and littering in coastal and marine zones, and activities to collect litter in the environment.
Prevention of waste generation 
There are a number of different approaches for reduc -
ing the generation of waste. Policymakers can address 
this by discouraging practices that generate litter or limiting the use of products that contribute to marine litter. Single-use products warrant attention as they are among the items most frequently found in the marine environment. Items like single-use plastic bags, food or beverage containers can be addressed via educa -
tion and outreach and with economic instruments (Oosterhuis et al. 2014). Such instruments, such as fees, charges or taxes, can provide a disincentive by penalising undesirable practices. They can also be addressed by direct bans on their use (Box 6.10). 
Taxes and levies generate revenues that can be used 
for addressing consumer behaviour, but they can also be controversial in regards to the use of revenues and their impacts on individuals’ attitudes and behaviours (Section 6.8). Alternative ways of providing incentives for the desired behaviour include discounts for envi -
ronmentally friendly behaviour of consumers, such as deposit schemes that give money as a reward when materials are returned for recycling.
Economic incentives can be powerful to discourage 
undesirable practices, especially when they are com -
municated as monetary losses. Some instruments such as levies also generate revenues that can be used for financing activities such as improving waste collection infrastructure and awareness campaigns. However, they come with the caveat that they actually reveal that certain practices such as uncontrolled dis -
posal of waste are common or ‘normal’. Alternatively, initiatives can also emphasize and promote behaviour that reduces littering. For example, promoting reusable cups or refillable water bottles can help establish a culture of reducing waste.
Box 6.10 Bans on plastic bags
In 2012, Hawaii introduced a county-by-county ban on plastic bags implemented over three years over the entire 
state. California passed the first state-wide ban in 2014, but has been challenged by industry and has been subject to a referendum in 2016. Several cities and counties in Oregon and Washington have implemented plastic bag ordi -
nances (Stickel et al. 2012). Bans on certain types of single-use plastic bags have been introduced in several other countries across the world to varying degrees of effectiveness, for example Bangladesh, Rwanda, India, Italy and Kenya. A study on the cost of banning plastic bags in Los Angeles County concluded that the ban would cost $5.72 per capita (AECOM 2010).
Tackling less visible forms of marine litter is challeng -
ing, as the information requirements for consumers are higher than with visible litter items. For example, personal care products, such as cosmetics and tooth -
pastes, frequently contain microbeads as an exfoliating agent (UNEP 2015). At a glance, it is not straightforward for consumers to detect plastic ingredients in personal care products and further outreach was needed to change consumer behaviour.
A tendency that has been growing during the last few 
years concerns the use of social media technology (e.g. Facebook™, Twitter™ and YouTube™, etc.) to reach a wider audience, see Box 6.11. 
Box 6.11 Informing and empowering consumers by social media
The “Beat the Microbead” campaign quickly gained momentum in 2012. It specifically targeted microbeads used in 
personal care products and provided a smartphone app to identify products with microbeads. The initiative led to many manufacturers and retailers rethinking their product policy. Originally an initiative of two Dutch NGOs (the North Sea Foundation and the Plastic Soup Foundation), the initiative gained wider support by environmental and consumer groups, and is now supported by UNEP (www.beatthemicrobead.org).
The Marine Debris Tracker (MDT) is a partnership of the NOAA Marine Debris Division and the Southeast Atlantic 
Marine Debris Initiative (SEA-MDI). First released in 2011 and updated in 2014, this app was created by Jenna Jambeck to raise awareness about marine litter and help NOAA collect information about the position and con -
dition of marine litter. The MDT and associate web platform aim at engaging citizens in a positive manner: they can expand their dedication to an issue, can also feel empowered by collecting and presenting data in the MDT community (Jambeck et al. 2015). The app has global coverage. There have been 12,000 downloads, over 62,400 entries with 539,700 debris items logged (Jason Rolfe, Mid-Atlantic and Caribbean Regional Coordinator, personal communication). Although the main activity of the app is linked to reporting chronic debris, it has also developed a special role in tracking marine litter reaching the US beaches after Japan tsunami and Superstorm Sandy. The app does not require users to collect litter after having reported it (and hence creates a risk of double counting) (http://www.marinedebris.engr.uga.edu/).92  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANPrevention of littering behaviour
Information and awareness campaigns are crucial to 
tell consumers about their contribution to marine litter. This is especially the case for marine litter sources and pathways that are less obvious. These activities need to identify littering contexts and specifically address certain consumer groups and ages, such as school -
children, outdoor travellers or interested citizens who want to engage actively, including as citizen scientists (Eastman et al. 2013).
Box 6.12 Role of ambassadors in awareness raising
Throughout the years, several celebrities have become ambassadors for the protection of the marine environment. 
In 2014 Lewis Pugh, United Nations Patron of the Oceans, swam in the Seven Seas to draw attention to the health of the oceans (UNEP NEWS CENTER 2014). In 2015, the swimmer Federica Pellegrini took part in the campaign “Ma il Mare non vale una cicca?” (“Isn’t the sea worth a butt?”), organized by the Italian association Marevivo and the famous surfers Ben Skinner and Corinne Evans took part in the ‘Save Our Seas’ Marine Litter Tattoo Campaign, organized by Surfers Against Sewage (SAS, http://www.sas.org.uk/news/campaigns/save-our-seas-marine-litter-tattoo-campaign/).
In the same year, Jack Johnson was appointed Goodwill Ambassador by UNEP. The singer declared that he would 
focus his activity in particular on three issues; one of them being marine litter (http://www.unep.org/gpa/news/JackJohnsonGWA.asp). 
Ambassadors for raising awareness need not be internationally known celebrities. In fact, their effectiveness as a 
voice for taking action against marine litters stems from their role as model and inspiration for the local community or region of interest. For example, Mama Piru, a native Rapa Nui woman from Easter Island, has become famous for her commitment to cleaning up the coast every day. She has been fulfilling her promise for the last 15 years.
For the most problematic types of marine litter, bans on certain products and activities are conceivable. These include restricting smoking on beaches, banning plastic bags with certain product characteristics, or banning products containing microbeads. For example, the US has signed legislation to ban microbeads. A study by Environment Canada (2015) recommends classifying microbeads as a toxic substance under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.Collecting litter from the marine environment
While efforts to reduce sources of marine litter are 
important, clean-up activities remain necessary. Local or regional authorities are often in charge, but a num -
ber of initiatives exist that explicitly involve volunteers (Table 6.5). The role of such engagement is two-fold. Clean-ups can help reduce the physical amount of litter entering streams, waterways and oceans. In addi -
tion, they are an important tool for bringing together communities and stakeholders to generate a common sense of action, raise awareness and create ownership.

Although activities carried out by volunteers are fun -
damental because they help local municipalities and 
alleviate costs, it is important to underline that their participation to a clean-up event constitutes an oppor -
tunity cost. It has been estimated that the participation of volunteers in two of the largest clean-up schemes in the UK, MCS Beachwatch and Keep Scotland Beautiful National Spring Clean, is worth approximately $173,500 (EUR 131,000) (Mouat et al. 2010).

Conclusions
Engaging consumers is crucial to addressing micro -
plastics. Drawing links to the risks to human health and 
well-being can be an important step to raise awareness regarding the role that consumers play. It is important to empower consumers, show potential solutions and support concrete action.
The prevention of waste generation and littering are 
important and widespread awareness raising activi -
ties are needed. Consumers require information about product sustainability. Modern technology like smart -
phone apps and social media help reach wider audi -
ences, though traditional channels of reaching out to consumers such as print media remain important. Equally, engaging consumers in clean-up activities is an important element to create awareness and interest in helping address the issue, especially when targeting different groups and demographies such as schoolchil-dren, coastal residents and visitors.
Ideally, behaviour change would be based on intrinsic 
motivation (see Section 6.8). For this reason, it is impor -
tant to promote desirable practices to establish the default behaviour that would be in line with address -
ing marine plastic litter. One example is facilitating and removing barriers to the reuse of everyday items such as cups, bottles or plastic bags. Providing easy-to-use waste disposal facilities for waste is another. Such activities are not only important in coastal zones, but also further inland, as a high share of plastic litter occurs on land. 
Economic instruments and incentives can play a role in 
addressing marine plastic litter. They are, for example, suitable to limit the amount of plastic items in use. Decision-makers need to be aware of mechanisms that address marine litter, such as fees, charges, taxes and deposit refund schemes (ten Brink et al. 2009). Sometimes, such instruments will focus on the price mechanism, i.e. making undesirable practices more expensive to discourage them. In other cases, the focus might be on generating revenue to finance activi -
ties related to marine litter, such as improving collec -
tion infrastructure or awareness-raising. In practice, these two mechanisms might be used in combination. However, decision-makers also need to be aware of the limits of economic instruments, as some evidence exists that external economic drivers of behaviour can have unintended and unwelcome consequences (see Section 6.8).6.8 W aste management and recycling 
6.8.1  Introduction
W
aste management practices and infrastructure are 
critically important to address marine litter (Jambeck et al. 2015). Where there is a lack of such infrastructure, there is a high risk of microplastics entering the marine environment. Figure 6.2 presents an overview of the coverage of solid waste management globally. 
While there are reports of management and misman -
agement of plastics within national borders, there is 
a mismanagement of plastics through the trade and transport of plastic as a commodity. The discussion of land-to-sea plastic leakage has omitted the land-to-land leakage. In many cases, plastic products and packaging that have few or no markets in the US and Europe are exported to countries, like China or India, that have less stringent or no controls on environmental contamination and worker health and safety. In 2012 China implemented the “Green Fence”
11 in an effort 
to reduce the import of low-quality plastic products and packaging, mostly originating from the west coast of the United States, that were becoming marine lit -
ter after China had little use for them as well. What the Green Fence has done for US exporters of plastic waste, mostly from recycle centres that find it cheaper to export waste than pay landfill tipping fees, is to force US cities to revisit the full lifecycle of plastic products and packaging.
12 The global trend is to ‘clean-up’ waste 
exports, which may further catalyse EPR for upstream design for end-of-life recovery.
The wastewater treatment and water supply sectors are 
important – both as means of reducing marine litter and as sources thereof (e.g. small plastic biofilters that pro -
vide a physical structure to support bacteria in water purification plants
13). Wastewater treatment plants can 
capture significant amounts of plastic waste and the existence of a water supply infrastructure that provides citizens with safe drinking water reduces the demand for (plastic) bottled water. Recycling of plastic can both avoid the generation of marine litter and reduce plastic already in the sea when collected and recycled. This section focuses in particular on recycling initiatives. 
6.8.2
 Benefits of action
W
ell-developed waste infrastructures can help 
reduce marine litter. In parts of the world where such 
infrastructures do not exist or are inadequate, some initiatives are being introduced to provide waste  
management at a very local or community level, as a means of tackling litter problems. A small number of examples are included in Table 6.6.

Box 6.13 Wastewater treatment and microplasticsWastewater streams transport microfibres, for example from textiles, into the sea (Browne 2011), since they cannot be 
retained by all existing wastewater treatment systems or traditional washing machine filters. Some modern systems are capable of capturing even above 90 % of microfibres, though this still allows some significant leakage of micro -
fibres into the aquatic environment.
Options to address microfibres could include attaching filters to washing machines, and innovative technologies such 
as additives for laundry detergents or textile finishing treatments to reduce the release of plastic microfibres during the washing process (Life-Mermaids Project, 2015).
Recycling captures value from used materials as well as offering the potential to create jobs. Plastics SA report -
ed that 1,084,400 tonnes of plastic waste was land -
filled in South Africa in 2014, whilst 1,400,000 tonnes (22.5% of plastic waste produced) were recycled; 32.9 % of plastic packaging material was recovered. The com -
pany has set up over 450 fishing line collection bins across Cape Town to facilitate recycling.

Plastics SA, the informal sector of the plastic recycling 
industry employs 47,420 people, whilst 6,037  people are employed in the formal sector; this represented an  11.4 % increase in jobs in the industry in 2014 com -
pared with the previous year. The majority of the 221 plastics recycling companies and estimated 1,800 con -
verters in the industry in South Africa are small, medi -
um and micro enterprises (SMMEs) (Motsoai 2015).

Conclusions
There are a number of initiatives around the world 
where socio-economic benefits and/or value are gen -
erated from collected marine litter, whether in terms of employment created, collected materials (e.g. plastics), or profit from recycled products sold. Some of these values are summarized in the table below; these should not be taken as comprehensive, but they do give a snapshot of several examples where marine litter is converted into socio-economic value.
6.9 M oving towards effective long-term 
behaviour change
6.9.1  Introduction
W
ithin this chapter, the general costs of microplastics 
and marine litter have been summarized for a range 
of sectors. To fully understand the cost-effectiveness of initiatives and campaigns that aim to reduce the amount of waste entering and remaining in the marine environment, it is fundamental to acknowledge the underlying, influential factors. Understanding determi-nants of behaviour and behaviour change – identifying these necessary factors that are fundamental for inter -
ventions to be effective and long lasting – is a large and continually growing research field. Whilst it is not within the scope of this report to comprehensively review all influential factors, we have described some of the fac -
tors relevant for the initiatives described. Please see Darnton (2008) for a more detailed review. Below, we focus on five factors that seem relevant in the present context: the importance of risk perception, perceived responsibility and behavioural control, social norms, motivation and demographic factors. 
6.9.2
 Risk perception
T
he first assessment report summarized research on 
risk perception principles and applied these to marine 
litter and microplastics. In many cases, a perception of some degree of risk is required to engage people in the issue and trigger behaviour change. In this sub-section, we provide an update on media reporting since the first report, which is a common source of information that individuals use to develop their risk perceptions. From this, we introduce key findings from the risk communication literature; especially the mental models approach used in interdisciplinary research (Morgan  2002) and we draw on research examining risk perception regarding nanoparticles and nano-technology.
The first report showed a growing trend over time for 
the terms ‘microbeads’ and ‘microplastics’ to be men -tioned in UK newspaper reporting. Monitoring July 2004 to July 2014, we found 29 articles over ten years, with 26 appearing since 2012. Updating this exact analysis, the most recent year (July 2014 to July  2015) already contained 25 media articles in total; a further four have appeared between July and October 2015. In addition, we coded whether these 29 new articles focused on the problem ( n=9), the solution ( n=9) or contained both 
(n=10).
15 Thus, the trend for more exposure on the topic 
in the media is continuing, with coverage of both on the problem and solutions. To promote behaviour change, this is especially important, as individuals need to perceive the relevance of the issue and how their actions can help (Tanner and Kast 2003). Still, empirical research on public risk perception of microplastics and nanoplastics is still lacking.
Most risk perception research is purely descriptive, 
monitoring perceptions in certain stakeholder groups (most often the public). Granger Morgan et al. (2002) mental models approach is different in that it starts with risk perception, but assesses this for the explicit pur -
pose of risk communication. The goal of this approach is to make recommendations for empirically informed and targeted messages. The approach is designed for interdisciplinary risk contexts and explicitly deals with potentially disparate ‘expert’ and ‘non-expert’ views. The model contains three broad steps combining quali -
tative and quantitative social research: a) create and compare expert and non-expert mental models to iden -
tify discrepancies, b) test non-expert models in repre -
sentative large-scale surveys, c) develop and evaluate risk communication based on insights from the first two steps. Applications of this approach show that expert and non-expert views often differ, that communication materials benefit from repeated piloting in target audi -
ences and that targeted communications can improve understanding. For example, Boase (2015) investigated perceived risks and benefits of consuming shellfish using the mental models approach. He showed that the more uncertain people were about shellfish facts, the less likely they were to consume shellfish. A targeted mental models communication improved knowledge, reduced uncertainty and increased consumption inten -
tions compared to alternative communications. Note that microplastics did not emerge as a theme in this work, which concentrated on health risks and benefits. This means that at this time, microplastics were not seen as a salient threat to seafood consumers. 
Another aspect that was not covered in the first report 
is nanoplastics. Nanoplastics are an emerging issue because monitoring methods have not been developed yet and the scale of industrial production is unclear. However, there has been a literature around the per -
ception of “nanotechnologies” in the social sciences since the early 2000s. As opposed to other contest -
ed issues in new technology development (e.g. GM foods), public opinion on nanotechnologies appears to be largely positive, with “discussion of risk issues […] relatively limited so far” (Pidgeon and Rogers-Hayden 2007). Satterfield et al. (2009) provides a meta-analysis of recent studies about public perceptions of nanotechnology. Their key findings are that the majority of people surveyed in the US, UK and Canada believe the benefits outweigh the risks of nanotechnologies, 
15 One article did not contain enough information for coding.96  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANbut more than 40 % are unsure. This uncertainty is still 
present in recent work and has been linked to high 
fragility and mobility of attitudes (Satterfield et al. 2012). This is a considerable societal risk because new information or a future risk event has the potential to change public opinion rapidly in the case of such unstable attitudes. Pidgeon and Rogers-Hayden (2007) report on the outcome of a public engagement process (‘NanoJury UK’) that led to recommendations, which include more testing of new materials, communication in plain English and clear, plain-language labelling of products that contain nanotechnologies. At the interna -
tional level, the International Risk Governance Council has produced a White Paper (2006) and Policy Brief (2007) including recommendations (IRGC 2015). It is striking that no such research or debate exists to date for microplastics let alone nanoplastics specifically. 
6.9.3
 Perceived r
esponsibility & behavioural 
control
In many theories of behaviour change, two key factors 
are noted as important: perceptions of responsibility and perceived control or efficacy (Steg et al. 2012). Out of two people who have limited control over an issue, the one who has higher perceptions  of control is more 
likely to act. For example, marine litter initiatives that provide individuals the ability to dispose of waste (e.g. floating reception barges, Section 6.3) or recycle their fishing lines (e.g. Reel in and Recycle) will strengthen 
the perception of control and thus encourage positive behaviour (Steg and Vlek 2009). 
Perceived responsibility is also important in the con -
text of marine litter. Large-scale surveys within the 
MARLISCO project show that general public respon -
dents perceived sectors to vary widely in responsibil -
ity. Industry, decision makers (such as government and policy makers) and commercial users of the coast were viewed to have high responsibility. However, the respondents also held themselves responsible. This indicates that people were not discarding their own responsibility (Hartley et al. in preparation). This is fundamental, as a precedent of action is the perceived obligation or responsibility of the individual (Steg and Vlek 2009). A second MARLISCO study showed that a targeted educator training on marine litter was able to increase perceptions of own responsibility signifi-cantly, even in an already interested, selective sample (Hartley et al. in preparation). Given the many sectors and actors involved in the issue of marine litter, another promising example is the programme Amigos del Mar (Friends of the Sea) in Ecuador, led by the Comisión Permanente el Pacífico Sur (CPPS), which targets stu -
dents, fishers and tour operators as key influencers. It is clearly necessary to engage all sectors, emphasize their responsibility (e.g. by illustrating the cost of action and inaction) and work cooperatively to help address the problem of marine litter (see Section 6.9).6.9.4
  Social nor ms
Behaviour change can be influenced by a number of social factors, including social norms. These can be what the individual thinks is common practice and is widely accepted (descriptive norms) and what ought to be done in society (injunctive norms). Marine litter in itself can be seen to indicate a descriptive norm: the presence of the items imply that it is normal practice and thus acceptable to litter, which will likely lead to more littering behaviours (Keizer et al. 2008). A number of psychological studies in terrestrial environments have repeatedly shown that people are more likely to litter if a) the setting is littered (descriptive norm) and/or b) if they witness someone litter (injunctive norm). On the other hand, these social norms can also encourage desired actions, as littering reduces and removal of rubbish increases if people are in a clean setting and/or if they witness someone picking up and throwing away rubbish (Keizer et al. 2008). 
A number of the initiatives referred to within this 
chapter can be seen to include components of social norms. Social media campaigns can have both injunc -
tive and descriptive norms. For instance, the Beat the Microbead campaign explicitly focused on the problem and what ought to be done (see Section 6.3) but it could be argued that the social media activities set social norms. The site has more than 1200 Twitter followers and more than 5500 Facebook likes (Plastic soup 2015). In these social media communities the use of microplastics in cosmetics is not seen as accept -
able. Providing a forum for like-minded people has no doubt helped strengthen the campaign. A range of other marine litter apps are summarized in Table 6.7 that all include plastics, although this list is not com -

 Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
T
he motives for undertaking particular behaviours 
play an important role in whether the behaviour will be 
long lasting. Behaviours that are personally reward -
ing (thus have an intrinsic motive) are more likely to re-occur than those that are motivated for a reward or punishment (extrinsic motivation, De Young 1993). For example, charges on plastic bags or fines on littering (e.g. Section 6.6) can encourage an extrinsic motiva -
tion to avoid a financial punishment, and similarly deposit schemes that pay for rubbish and schemes that remove fees have the extrinsic motivation to gain a reward. These and similar schemes have been found to be effective, but the behaviour change will typically only last as long as the duration of the incentive. A further key question is what exactly is incentivized. For example, programmes that incentivize less quantity of rubbish in bins may have side effects such as illegal dumping or use of public bins. There is also a risk that by focusing on extrinsic motives, negative behaviours may be encouraged. For example, the fishing for litter schemes that pay commercial fishers to catch and land litter may increase the rubbish being thrown into the sea, as it becomes financially viable to litter then collect the rubbish (see Box 6.14).GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  97

gram and BC Ministry of Environment98  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANBox 6.14 Voluntary vs. paid initiatives
The different fishing for litter schemes in Section 6.3 illustrate how two similar initiatives with different approaches 
can relate to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. In Box 6.4, two approaches were described, one that paid fishers to collect marine litter in Korea and one that requires voluntary involvement by commercial fishers by providing the facilities and collection of waste for free in Belgium. During a study examining KIMO’s Fishing For Litter scheme in Southwest England and Scotland, which adopts the voluntary approach (Wyles et al. in preparation), the risks and benefits of these approaches were discussed. It was evident that paying fishers could be seen to encourage the unintended attitudes and behaviour of only doing it for the money, whereas KIMO’s approach focused on providing the facilities (linking to perceived behavioural control noted above) and thus raising awareness, interest and concern over the topic (linking to risk perception) in addition to removing the immediate cost of landing litter to the fishers (a less extreme financial incentive). This could be seen to address a more intrinsic motivation, potentially leading to a sustained behaviour change.
In contrast, initiatives that focus more on encouraging an intrinsic motivation to do the behaviour will more likely be long-lasting. These include awareness rais -
ing campaigns that aim to get individuals emotionally involved and discuss how they can be part of the solu -
tion (e.g. Section 6.5). When individuals volunteer to do pro-environmental activities, they are likely to feel good about themselves and have achieved something per -
sonally meaningful, which in turn increases the chance of repeating the behaviour (Asah and Blanhna 2013; Clary et al. 1998). 
Halvorsen (2012) reviewed the effects of norms and pol -
icy incentives on recycling across ten OECD countries. 
The largest predictor of recycling efforts was the belief that it is beneficial for the environment, and to a lesser extent that it was a civic duty. Households with either weight- or unit-based pricing recycled significantly less than those without monetary incentives, with Halvorsen concluding that monetary incentives might crowd out morally motivated behaviour. Miafodzyeva (2013) pro -
vides a meta-analysis of 63 recent studies and found that moral norms, information and convenience were the most important predictors of recycling behaviour, followed by environmental concern. Sociodemographic predictors only made a “poor” contribution according to the authors, and pricing did not contribute. This evidence suggests that incentive policies need to be considered carefully and may not be the best approach to targeting behaviour related to marine litter, such as recycling behaviours here. This is linked to a broader movement within the behaviour change literature that suggests changing values and self-identity (associated with intrinsic motivations) is associated with more sus -
tainable and long-term behaviour change than extrinsic motivations (e.g. Poortinga et al. 2013). 
6.9.6
 Influence of demographic factors
Why demography matters
D
emography involves the study of the composition of 
populations. Human populations can be classified in 
many different ways, including in terms of ethnicity, reli -
gious background, social status/caste, degree of pov -
erty or wealth, level of education, age structure, birth and death rates, and gender differences. Those demo -
graphic factors contributing to human well-being may be measured using individual descriptors or by using a collective indicator such as the Human Development Index (HDI).
16 Many aspects of human society are linked 
to where individuals fit into the demographic structure of their community. For example, those involved in the informal recycling industry in India or West Africa are often associated with particular demographic groups, based on age, gender, income and social status. They may be more exposed to risk as a result, including suffering significant human health consequences from handling plastics associated with electronic goods (UNEP 2016). Countries with a high  HDI (e.g. OECD) tend to generate more waste per capita but have more effective waste management systems, with less leak -
age to the environment (Jambeck et al. 2015). Countries with low HDIs may generate less waste per capita but tend to have poorly developed waste management infrastructure, a lack of funding for improvements and less effective governance structures  (UNEP 2016). In addition, there is a legal and illegal trade in waste from North America and western Europe to Asia and West Africa, as it is often cheaper to transport waste from a high-cost country to a lower-cost country, where education levels, governance, environmental standards and compliance may all be lower.
17 
It is important to include demographics when analys -
ing the generation of microplastics, the sectors of society which are affected by microplastics, and when seeking to change behaviours and promote effective reduction measures for microplastics. This has been recognized by many individuals and groups seeking to raise awareness about issues though campaigns and educational initiatives. 
Demographics and behaviour
Individual consumption of goods and services, per -
sonal habits (e.g. use of reusable bags and packaging) 
and waste practices (such as littering) are key drivers of marine litter. Consumer behaviour derives both from individual preferences and tastes, and from corporate strategies and marketing. Microbeads, for example, were introduced into consumer goods as a top-down corporate strategy, not in response to bottom-up con -
sumer demand.

Little is known about the demographic factors influ -
encing perceptions and behaviours of relevance to 
marine litter, but it seems to assume there will be effects in particular circumstances. For example, a recent study in the USA on the purchase of bottled water indicated that age and income were stronger predictors of consumption than gender. In some coun -
tries it is the unavailability of safe potable water that drives the demand for bottled water, irrespective of other factors. Littering behaviours are demographi -
cally variable, although cross-national comparisons have not been made and it is not clear to what extent gender is relevant (KAB, 2009; Lyndhurst 2013; Curnow and Spehr  2005). Clearly, sustained and comparative research is needed to understand the demographic drivers of such behaviours, and thus the possible levers for change. Further research into the demographics of consumer behaviour specific to marine plastic pollu -tion, and willingness to change those behaviours, is urgently needed. To extend on the brief overview of demographic differences outlined in the first report (GESAMP 2015), potential gender-based aspects are described more fully as an illustrative example. 
Gender-based aspects
Gender is one of several key factors to consider when 
assessing the societal response to microplastics. However, its importance may be hidden if social cat -
egories in an environmental assessment are not dif -
ferentiated by gender. The influence of gender on the frame of reference for environmental inquiry can be demonstrated using a general model of environmental gender analysis (Table 6.8). This approach could be adapted to take account of other societal character -
istics.

The extent to which gender per se is the main factor in influencing an outcome will depend on other individual, situational and demographic factors, and these are likely to vary widely on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. For example, an increase in relative wealth or educational attainment may alter the relative impor -
tance of other demographic factors for individuals or communities.
Gender and fisheries, an example
Commercial fisheries and aquaculture are key eco -
nomic activities in many coastal regions, and artisanal 
fishing (i.e. traditional, small-scale) may be vital for food security. It is a sector that both generates and is impacted by marine plastics. Many roles in this sec -
tor are differentiated by gender. Women participate throughout most parts of the fishing cycle; including post-capture processing, inland-waters and onshore aquaculture, net-mending, processing, and selling. Women fish in the coastal zones, inshore reefs and mangroves, they glean at low tide, and cultivate fish fry in the shallows (Lambeth et al. 2014; FAO 2015), but very few participate in open-sea capture fishing. Open-sea, commercial and large-boat fishing is almost entirely a male domain. In many cultures around the world there are taboos, prohibitions, superstitions and cultural norms about femininity that keep women off the boats and on the shore. This renders women’s fish -
ing contributions largely invisible – it is left out of most data collection efforts, as well as overlooked in con -
ventional government or aid programmes that support fishing and fishers (Siason et al. 2010). If there are to be remediation programmes, financing to cope or reduce plastics pollution, or education programmes about plastics, a concerted effort to make these gender-inclusive will be essential. 100  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANBecause of these spatial differences in women’s and 
men’s fishing, there may be significant gender differ -
ences in the experience of, knowledge of, and impacts of plastics pollution. Debris build-up in littoral and coastal zones can be severe and is different in char -
acter than open-sea plastics pollution, as analyses discussed elsewhere in this report demonstrate. This will have a different impact on women’s fishing activi -
ties in the near-shore zone than on men’s fishing in open oceans. Consequently, loss of economic activity, damage to well-being, and mental health aspects of impacts from degraded environments (see Table 6.10) may be associated with gender, in particular circum -
stances.
6.9.7
 
Conclusion
In order to make the most of the initiatives and 
schemes that aim to help tackle microplastics in the marine environment, it is necessary to consider indi -
vidual and demographic factors. We briefly reviewed a subset of factors known to influence behaviour and behaviour change. 
Understanding people’s perceptions of the risks asso -
ciated with microplastics is important, as this can result 
in direct impacts on different sectors (e.g. to the fishing industry if people start to avoid fish fearing they may be at risk of taking in microplastics) and on the issue at hand (e.g. if they do not perceive microplastics as a problem, individuals will be less willing to adopt behav -
iours to address the problem). Whilst scientifically little is currently known on the public’s perceptions of micro -
plastics, a simple media analysis shows that there is a sudden rise in interest in microplastics in the UK, so we can expect risk perceptions to become more promi -
nent. More research is urgently needed, ideally with systematic methodologies, such as the mental models approach. Similarly, with nanoplastics as an emerging issue, social research exists on perceptions of nano -
technologies more broadly, which could be examined in greater detail. 
As well as individuals’ perception of the problem and 
associated risks, people’s perceived responsibility, behavioural control and social norms all play an impor -
tant role on behavior. Similarly, these perceptions and behaviours can also vary with demographic position -
alities, e.g. health effects, personal and community disruption caused by environmental degradation, and understanding the pathways to solutions, may vary with age, class, and gender, among other demographic variables. Whereas different sectors are seen to vary in responsibility, all sectors seem to accept that it is everyone’s duty to address marine litter. Thus, it is necessary to collaborate on solutions. Emphasizing what ought to be done and is being done can be a powerful tool in promoting positive behaviour change. Understanding what motivates a particular behaviour is necessary to sustain good acts, as intrinsic motivations (such as benefit for the environment, feelings of moral duty) are key predictors of recycling behaviour likely to last long-term in contrast to extrinsic motives (such as incentives or fines) that are often short-lived and can have adverse effects on behaviour.
To paint a fuller portrait of the social dimensions of 
plastics pollution and to map potential transformative pathways towards solutions, serious, cross-national and sustained research – as well as fundamental data collection – is needed. For example, considerable work is needed on the gender dimensions of marine-based livelihoods, on health and environmental impacts of environmental change in these environments, and on risk perceptions. 
6.10 C ollaborating on solutions
6.10.1  Conclusions on actor roles – multi-level  
governance
Since marine litter occurs on a global scale and knows 
no geographic boundaries, but also has impacts down to the local level, action is needed by many dif -
ferent stakeholders. The capacity and responsibility to address marine litter is spread across a range of stakeholders and innovative collaborations are needed. Engagement is necessary by those who are respon -
sible for and those impacted by marine litter if the problem is to be addressed effectively:
•	Need for international collaboration to reach solutions. International collaboration such as the Global Partnership on Marine Litter (GPML), the UNEA Resolution on marine plastic debris and microplastics, and the June 2015 commitment by the G7 group of nations can help highlight the problem and catalyse solutions;
•	National governments can invest in infra -
structure, set incentives, legislate, inspect and enforce, support research and develop -
ment (R&D), and encourage greater producer and consumer responsibility;
•	Municipalities/local governments can invest further in waste, wastewater treatment and port reception infrastructure that can help prevent marine litter; 
•	Private sector can invest in innovative prod -
uct design (e.g. improved durability, recy -
clability and green chemistry) and embrace producer responsibility more widely. In addi -
tion, industries should reduce as much as possible the loss and disposal of products at sea;
•	NGOs and voluntary organizations can moti -
vate changes in consumer habits (e.g. the Beat the Microbead campaign/app) and norms and encourage producer responsibility;
•	Local communities can engage in aware -
ness-raising and clean-up activities, as well as participating in small- or larger-scale projects to generate value from collected marine litter;

 T
ools and opportunities
There are a range of tools and opportunities for addressing macro and microplastic throughout the supply chain – see Figure 6.1 for an illustration of the supply chain and key sectors. Given the longevity of plastic and its value as a resource, some argue that an overarching circular economy approach should be adopted, encouraging greater reuse, repair, remanu -
facture and recycling, so as to minimize the risk of marine plastic waste, and keep as much of plastics’ value in the economy. 
There is a wide range of solutions to address marine 
litter, from upstream prevention to downstream clean-up. These broadly follow a hierarchy for marine litter management that builds on the concept of the waste management hierarchy, which is widely accepted in waste management policy and legislation. The typical waste hierarchy prioritizes prevention as the preferred method of waste management, followed by reuse, material recycling, energy recovery and disposal. Figure 6.3 uses this order and applies it to marine litter to create a suggested ideal hierarchy for the manage -
ment of marine litter.
Figure 6.3  A hierarchy for marine litter management (Source: Emma Watkins, IEEP)
Within this hierarchy, various actions to address marine litter can be grouped as follows:
Preventing/reducing waste that contributes to 
marine litter:
•	Product design changes and extended pro -
ducer responsibility can help to prevent the 
generation of marine litter and avoid certain impacts which are more difficult to address after litter has been created.
•	Target group-specific awareness raising, including consumers to reduce the genera -
tion of waste (e.g. reusable items for every-day use or identifying microbeads in per -
sonal care products, economic incentives such as discounts for reusable packaging).Preventing/reducing litter reaching the marine 
environment:
•	Invest in new and improved waste manage -
ment infrastructure, including to avoid waste 
being blown from landfills (e.g. perimeter netting), riverine, port and beach infrastruc -
tures (e.g. litter traps, booms and bins). 
•	Economic incentives such as deposit refund schemes and plastic bag charges can help influence consumer choice and/or encour -
age different habits (e.g. return bottles; choose multi-use bags) which can reduce the incidence of marine litter. Similarly litter -
ing fees and fines for illegal disposal of waste can be useful incentive tools.
•	Bans (e.g. plastic bag bans, smoking bans on beaches, bans on plastic blasting in ship -
yards) can provide a cost-effective solution. However, feasibility will depend on various 102  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANfactors including the availability of viable 
substitutes, political considerations etc. 
•	Carefully designed campaigns and aware -
ness activities can help avoid the generation of marine litter through improved habits and social norms and can spur changes in prod -
uct design. This is an essential upstream preventative measure.
Collecting litter from the marine environment:
•	Fishing for litter can be a useful option in the hierarchy of means to address marine litter (although this can only address certain types of marine litter) and can be combined with economic incentives to encourage action.
•	Marine litter clean-ups that engage volun -
teers in clean-up activities can help reduce costs (although the time of volunteers also has an economic value) and improve aware -
ness, which in turn can be an upstream action – by raising awareness, individuals are less likely to litter.

priorities
6.11.1  Conclusions
W
hile we have a fair and growing understanding of 
the costs of macroplastic litter, at present we lack an 
adequate understanding of the costs of microplastic litter. Similarly, there is little information on the cost-effectiveness of actions related to microplastics. Given the physical links between macro and microplastics, the motivations for action on marine plastic cannot be fully separated in terms of macro and microplastics. The argument for keeping the value of plastic within an increasingly circular economy, and avoiding envi-ronmental, health and social and economic burdens associated with marine litter, is clear when looking at the macro scale. It is less clear if looking only at the microplastic scale, given information gaps. This under -
lines both the importance of research into impacts and costs, and the importance of looking at both macro- and microplastics when considering costs, policy responses and specific actions.
At present we lack an adequate understanding of the 
costs of marine litter, the cost-effectiveness of actions, motivations for action and hence the potential of mea -
sures to tackle marine litter. This weakens the argument for keeping the value of plastic within an increasingly circular economy, and avoiding environmental, health and social and economic burdens associated with plastic become marine litter.
6.11.2
 Knowledge gaps
Economics
•	T
he core knowledge gap as regards eco -
nomics is the difficulty in estimating the 
costs of impacts of microplastics with the current level of (lack of) knowledge on the health and ecosystem impacts of microplas -
tics. A fair amount is known of macroplastics and the benefits of acting on macroplastics include both avoided impacts of macroplas -
tics and microplastics (as the macro breaks down into micro). The economics of the two cannot be separated easily.
•	It is therefore critical to address the scientific knowledge gaps on microplastic impacts to be able to build a nuanced and robust economic analysis for microplastics. The economics of macroplastics are already well enough understood (though of course data gaps remain) to warrant action on macro plastics that will also have an impact on microplastics. A key area of impacts will be linked to how public perception changes with knowledge related to the level of ingestion of microplastics in fish as this can in principle be expected to lead to a lower demand and lower price. Research into the likely price and demand effects related to perceptions of quality will be important.
Social aspects
•	There is a lack of information about level of knowledge that the general public, the many sectors involved, international bodies and policymakers have about microplastics.
•	There is a lack of knowledge about the level of understanding of risk in general by the public, and microplastics in particular. 
6.11.3
 Research priorities
R
esearch priorities are noted below for: science, 
economics and social aspects in turn. In each case, research needs related to understanding the problem and related to the solutions are included.
Science related priorities are:
•	Understanding microplastic impacts 
on human health via fish/shellfish inges -
tion, how social perceptions respond to  
uncertainty/knowledge, and how these risks translate into consumer demand and thus economic impacts;
•	An understanding of the perceived and actual nature and extent of ecosystem impacts of smaller marine debris (e.g. nanoparticles and microfibres) and leachates/uptake from all debris (e.g. chemicals that can be endocrine disruptors); and
•	Understanding the nature and scale of plas -
tic footprints – of a person, a product, com -
pany, sector, of a nation.GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  103
Economics of action and inaction
Research to understand the problem
•	Improve understanding of the costs of inac -
tion and how it relates to costs of action to 
underline where early action is particularly important, beneficial or effective. This could be done at the macro, sector, product and type of marine litter scales to give different evidence base for different decision frame -
works and governance processes;
•	Improve understanding by policy-makers of the cost of action and the benefits of action to highlight cost-effective solutions; and
•	Determine the value of plastics (cost, benefit) to help underline the potential benefits of circular economy activities and the econom -
ic inefficiencies of letting plastic become waste – this needs to be done for plastics as a whole to be able to understand measures that affect both macro and microplastics.
Research on measures/solutions
Many of the measures that will affect the level of micro -
plastics in the seas will focus on addressing macro -
plastic marine litter. Research priorities include:
•	Research into the likely elasticity of demand for: a) plastic products – i.e. how is demand likely to change with price (e.g. for plastic bottles, plastic bags); and b) fish – i.e. how is demand likely to change with perception of quality and potential health impacts;
•	Explore the economics of recycling for plastic waste – values of recycling of waste before it becomes marine litter, the values of different plastic types that have become marine litter and hence incentives for recycling;
•	Additional information on the costs of litter prevention and clean-up activities;
•	Assessment of the long-term effectiveness and cost-efficiency of existing actions and initiatives on microplastics, to provide infor -
mation to support and justify action;
•	Information on the costs of action that have been, or could be, taken by producers (e.g. more environmentally-friendly design, par -
ticipation in extended producer responsibil-ity and/or voluntary initiatives);
•	Information on the costs of inaction and action taken by the fisheries and aquacul -
ture sector, for example through ecological studies and surveys of fisherman to identify economic losses; and
•	Further data on marine-litter related costs to the shipping sector, and the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of actions taken by the sector.Perceptions and behaviour
Related to the problem
•	Research consumer perception about plas -
tic in seafood – i.e. how they would likely react to knowledge of plastic levels in their food and health risks – and demographic differences, including gender, in these per -
ceptions;
•	Further research on the impacts (including demographic factors) of marine litter on resident and visitor beach choice, as well as scrutiny on changes in tourism revenues and how these might be linked to marine litter;
•	Study the difference in public perception and established science on impacts of marine debris; and
•	Research into why many people do not take responsibility for their waste and what moti -
vates others who do take responsibility. 
Related to solutions/measures
•	Greater understanding of different stake -
holders’ (especially consumers’) perceptions of the issue and risks surrounding microplas -
tics in order to take appropriate action; 
•	Research the effectiveness of citizen-  
science campaigns;
•	Understand what would drive behaviour change away from single-use plastic;
•	Research the most effective messaging to encourage responsible use; and
•	Study how media campaigns cover risk and actions on marine debris and how to make better and more effective campaigns. 
Economic measures
This additional research, if successful, would allow 
a more comprehensive understanding, through an improved evidence base, of the costs of marine lit -
ter, the cost-effectiveness of actions, motivations for action and hence the potential of measures to tackle marine litter. This will keep the value of plastic within an increasingly circular economy and avoid environmen -

characterizing and quantifying small sized particles, e.g. 20 to 30 µm and nano-sized particles.
7.1 L essons from the first assessment
Many decisions are made in the process of design -
ing and implementing sampling plans that can affect the accuracy, reliability and representativeness of the results. The first GESAMP report on microplastics dis -
cusses the diversity of methods used to extract, quan -
tify and characterize microplastics from environmental matrices. The analysis of environmental samples is a multi-step process that includes sample prepara -
tion, extraction of microplastics, further purification (‘clean-up’), detection and quantification of particles, and identification of polymer types. The significant heterogeneity in the distribution of microplastics at sea and in sediments or beaches, emphasizes the need to harmonize sampling methodologies. Still, it can be dif -
ficult to choose a “best practice” when, for example, mass may be useful from an overall waste management perspective and number of particles may be of greater significance ecologically.
Whether sampling at the sea surface, on the seabed, 
in the intertidal or in biota, it is important to note that today a variety of methods have become available. At sea, towed nets with variable 330 µm net mesh, variable net aperture and net length are commonly utilized to filter large volumes of water in situ. Sampling sediments can require significantly more effort and resources, with finer-grained sediments usually requir -
ing more elaborate, laboratory-based separation tech -
niques. In biota, microplastics are measured in several species of fish, bivalves, crustaceans and birds, with greatest focus on stomach content analysis. 
In addition to differences in matrices, the diversity 
of plastic material has created methodological chal -
lenges, especially for targeted, quantitative analyses of microplastics. Most studies have focused on large microplastics (1–5 mm), including pre-production resin pellets, which are visible to the naked eye and can be picked out. However, when smaller particles are target -
ed for analysis, they are harder to identify. Initial sepa -
ration is a necessary step but it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish plastic from non-plastic particles with decreasing size. Raman and/or FTIR spectroscopy are then required to confirm the identification of plas -
tics, and their synthetic polymer for particles.This chapter will discuss the many methods that are used today with hopes to help facilitate harmonization of methods in the future. 
7.2 Int roduction
Microplastics comprise a heterogeneous assemblage of plastic particles that vary in size, shape, colour, specific density, chemical composition and other char -
acteristics. Most studies focus on quantifying their abundance in the marine environment and have applied a wide variety of methods for detecting, identifying and quantifying the contamination in many different types of aquatic habitats. 
Individual analyses are complicated by the spatial and 
temporal variability of microplastics and the types of matrices they are found in. Many surveys focus on open waters, shorelines and more recently estuaries (reviews in Moore 2008; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Cole et al. 2011; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Lusher et al.  2015; Rocha-Santos and Duarte 2015). They mea -
sure microplastics in surface waters, sediments, ani -
mals and even sea ice. A number of factors may modify the representativeness of data, including the proximity to a source of microplastic such as a large river system (Moore et al. 2002) and/or the size, shape and type of particles that are included in the analyses (e.g. plastic fibres; Browne et al. 2010). 
Datasets are further complicated by the wide variety 
of methodological approaches that are applied by different researchers to extract, identify, quantify and characterize microplastics. This makes comparison of reported microplastics difficult among studies without additional calculations based on assumptions (e.g. vol -
ume calculation, sediment densities, etc.). The major -
ity of these method inconsistencies can be related to: (i) differences in the lower and upper size limit examined;  (ii) the sensitivity of the applied extraction technique; and, (iii) differences in sampling technique, all leading to a wide variety of efficiencies and report -
ing units (Lusher et al. 2015; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013). 
For some time, the majority of sampling and extraction 
techniques were similar. Studies often relied on volume reduction and visual or density separation. But, as the GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  105
field has become more complex, a large assortment of 
variations has been developed. The large diversity in techniques applied for extraction, detection and quan -
tification of microplastics primarily derived from: i) the need to investigate and/or monitor a variety of matrices (ice, water, sediment, animal gut content, whole ani -
mals, etc); and, ii) the fact that measuring abundances of different sizes of microplastics (e.g. < 1 mm or 
1  to  5  mm) require different methods (Figure 7.1). Recent reviews and critiques of the field have called for an improvement in the methods to yield more com -
parable, precise and accurate results (Rocha-Santos and Duarte 2015). In order to achieve this goal, several studies have been carried out to analyse method devel -
opment and/or comparison for sampling (Norén 2007, 2011; Song et al. 2014), separation (Imhof  2012; Claessens et al. 2013), identification (Vianello, Boldrin et al. 2013) and clean-up (Claessens et al. 2013).
This chapter discusses sampling, extraction and ana -
lytical methods to characterize quantities, types, sizes 
and chemical properties of microplastics. These meth -
ods all have a given degree of specificity in what is targeted which depends on how the microplastics are extracted from the environmental matrix, such as sea -
water, sediment and biota.
7.3 S ampling and observations
The observed variations in environmental samples are largely due to many factors, including a large diversity in the type and size of particles, the locations exam -
ined (e.g. proximity to sources), the sample matrix, the patchy distribution of microplastics and sampling con -
ditions (e.g. weather conditions that affect sea-state). Sampling microplastics in the marine environment requires different approaches for different matrices (sea surface, water column, sediment, organisms). Defining a consistent sampling strategy for many of the different sample matrices (i.e. sediment, water, biota) is of high importance to achieve robust and comparable datasets. Statistical methods are also important in the development of monitoring protocols for harmoniza -
tion, which will improve our ability to assess the risk of contamination.

I
n seawater, surface layers are generally sampled, 
since many of the most mass-produced polymers (e.g. 
polyethylene and polypropylene) initially are buoyant and accumulate at the surface. Density values range from 0.85 to 0.94 g cm
−3 for polypropylene and from 
0.92 to 0.97 g cm−3 for polyethylene (Leslie 2011). Many 
other polymers (e.g. PVC, polycarbonates) are denser and likely to sink (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). As a con -
sequence of sampling methods, denser microplastics may be underrepresented in open ocean datasets (Woodall et al. 2014). Even for buoyant polymers, the condition of the sea affects suspension of microplastic particles and can skew results. During rough weather, researchers have found that buoyant plastics are mixed below the surface, causing an underestimate in the quantity of microplastics. Correction factors during strong winds have been developed and can be applied for sampling surface layers at sea during rough weather (Kukulka et al. 2012). A complicating factor is that many plastics designed for more durable applications can contain a wide variety of additive chemicals that can alter the initial polymer density.
The majority of sampling methods used to examine 
the spatial distribution, abundance, mass, type, and/or size of microplastics in seawater are based on volume-reduced samples, i.e. filtering large volumes of seawa -
ter with nets, and preserving only portions of interest for further processing. Surface water sampling tech -
niques mainly include manta trawls and neuston nets that sampled the top 10 cm of water. Few have used bongo nets and opening-closing nets for mid-water. Mesh sizes of the nets range from 0.053 to 3 mm, with a majority of the studies using 330 µm aperture mesh. Units commonly used for abundance estimates are number of particles per km
2, m2 or m3, using flow 
metres to estimate the volume of water sampled. 
The size ranges of microplastics obtained from bulk 
seawater are limited by the pore size of the mesh on the net (Ng and Obbard 2006). Net apertures, or the size of the mouth of the net, vary from 0.03 to 2 m
2, depending 
on the type and shape of the net. Of course, there are limitations and benefits to different nets. While smaller mesh sizes increase net resistance and clogging, the length, area or aspect ratio of the net may also vary, enabling higher-speed tows in some cases. Sampling techniques using 80µm mesh nets with a deeper verti -
cal sampling range have been proposed to quantify microplastic in the smaller size range and below the surface (Norén 2011; Dris et al. 2015). Another method for sampling microplastics from seawater is using long-term data from Continuous Plankton Recorders (CPRs) using a 280 µm mesh on regular and fixed routes. This is now considered a routine part of on-going CPR analysis (Cole et al. 2011) and has the advantage of allowing retrospective evaluation of microplastic abun -
dance in archived samples. The method is restricted to sub surface (down to 10 m) collection. Overall, it is important to consider the range of methods that can be used for sampling microplastics from seawater. Using mesh with different apertures can cause large varia -
tions in the quantity of microplastics collected, and it is important to note that the common method currently used, the manta trawl, does not capture smaller sized particles. After sampling in the field, further processing is needed to sieve and separate particles (i.e. extraction and analysis). Mesh sizes used in the laboratory often range from 38µm to 5 mm and often include 330 µm, 1 mm and 2 mm. To avoid degradation, plastics sepa -
rated from the sample have been dried and kept in the dark. This step is probably unnecessary if samples are examined within a few months of collection. When necessary, digestion methods are used to clean up the organic matter (see Chapter 7.3.3). In other cases, den -
sity separation in NaCl(aq) is used to isolate the plastic debris through flotation. Last, the samples may be counted directly and/or weighed to calculate the mass of the sample. To calculate mass, the sieved material must be dried.
7.3.2
 Microplastics in sediments
A w
ide range of sampling techniques are used for 
monitoring microplastics in sediments (reviewed 
in Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Van Cauwenberghe et al.  2013 and Rocha-Santos and Duarte 2015). These methods include density separation, filtration and/or sieving (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Rocha-Santos and Duarte  2015). To facilitate the extraction of micro -
plastics from organic components, such as organic debris (shell fragments, small organisms, algae or sea  
grasses, etc.) and other items such as pieces of tar, other methods can be applied, such as enzymatic, carbon tetrachloride (CCL
4) or Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) diges -
tion of organic materials (Galgani et al. 2011; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012; Cole et al. 2014).
The most common approach is to extract plastic par -
ticles from sediment using a density separation based 
on the difference in density between plastic and sedi -
ment particles. Typically, this is achieved by agitating the sediment sample in concentrated sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. However, as the density of the NaCl solution is only 1.2 g cm
-3, only low-density plastics 
float to the surface and are extracted. Different authors have addressed this issue by using different salt solu -
tions such as 1.4 g cm
-3 polytungstate (Corcoran et 
al.  2009), using zinc chloride (ZnCl2, 1.5-1.7 g cm-3; 
Imhof et al. 2012 or sodium iodide (NaI, 1.6 -1.8 g cm-3; 
Dekiff et al. 2014; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013) to obtain higher densities. These modifications result in an increased extraction efficiency for high-density microplastics such as polyvinylchloride (PVC, den -
sity  1.14 to 1.56 g cm
-3) or polyethylene terephthalate 
(PET, density 1.32 to 1.41 g cm-3). As these high-density 
plastics make up over 17 % of the global plastic demand 
(PlasticsEurope 2013), not including these types of microplastics can result in a considerable underestima -
tion of microplastic abundances in sediments, espe -
cially as these high-density plastics have a negative buoyancy and thus are much more likely to sink.
The choice of sampling strategy and sampling approach 
(reviewed by Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012) will eventually determine the unit in which observed abundances will be reported. While a simple conversion can sometimes be made to compare among studies (Lusher et al. 2015), comparison is often impossible or requires assump -
tions that lead to biased results. Studies sampling an area (using quadrants) will often report abundances per unit of surface (m
-2; e.g. Martins and Sobral 2011). 
If bulk samples from the surface to a specific depth are GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  107
taken, the reporting unit is m3 (e.g. Turra et al. 2014). 
Conversion between these types of abundances is 
possible, if sufficient information is available on sam -
pling depth. Yet, for 20 % of the studies this is not the 
case as reported sampling depths can range from 0 to 50 cm. Other widely used reporting units for sedi -
ment samples are volume (mL to L; e.g. Noren, 2007) or weight (g to kg; e.g. Claessens et al. 2011; Ng and Obbard 2006). Conversion between these two types of units is not straightforward. Detailed information on the density of the sediment is required. As this is never (as far as we could establish) reported in microplastic stud -
ies, assumptions have to be made (e.g. Claessens et al. 2011). Additionally, within studies reporting weight, a distinction must be made among those reporting wet (sediment) weight and those reporting dry weight. This adds to the constraints of converting from weight to volume units, or vice versa. Sediment samples from different locations or even different zones on one beach have different water content. Therefore, some authors choose to express microplastic abundance per sedi -
ment as dry weight to eliminate this variable (Claessens et al. 2013; Dekiff et al. 2014; Ng and Obbard 2006; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Vianello et al. 2013).
7.3.3
 Microplastics in biological samples
Biolo
gical sampling that involves the examination and 
characterization of microplastics consumed by marine 
organisms has been used for vertebrates (e.g. Lusher et al. 2013; Choy and Drazen 2013; Avio et al. 2015), invertebrates (e.g. Browne et al. 2008; Murray and Cowie 2011; Desforges et al. 2015; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2015) and birds (e.g. van Franeker et al. 2011). In general, the research question addressed will greatly influence which sampling and extraction technique to use. For example, the size range of microplastics overlaps the size range of micro- and macroplankton, highlighting the potential for microplastic ingestion by a wide variety of organisms (Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012). Thus, the sampling scale and methodology will depend on the size of the particle and the size of the studied organisms. Harmonization of sampling and extraction  
techniques should be adopted for monitoring  
purposes.
Gut contents can be analysed for the presence of 
microplastics, which can then be identified and quanti -
fied. This approach has now become one of the eco -
logical quality assessment markers used by OSPAR to assess both the abundance of microplastic debris at sea and regional differences and trends over time (van Franeker et al. 2011). In terms of monitoring and with regard to in situ experiments, one of the most important aspects is the choice of target species. It is important to consider (i) the exposure to plastics, especially for the species that are living at the surface or in the sediments, (ii) the ingestion rate, especially for filter feeders such as bivalves, (iii) the significance of results, which will vary depending on whether envi -
ronmental impact or human health is considered, (iv) the biological sensitivity of certain species, such as the high retention rate in birds of the procellariform family, and finally (v) a large distribution and easy sampling of the target species. The methodological difficulties for isolating particles from biota partly explain why only a few studies spe -
cifically addressed the occurrence of microplastics in marine organisms. The extraction and quantification of microplastics from organisms is especially challenging because the plastic pieces may be masked within bio -
logical material and tissues. Protocols have been pro -
posed on the extraction of microplastics from marine invertebrates after a pre-digestion of organic matter (Claessens et al. 2013), indicating the importance of solvent properties and pH for sample treatment, affect -
ing both the estimation and the characterization of the polymers by FT-IR. The enzymatic digestion of organic matter with proteinase k is a reliable method to extract microplastics from plankton samples (Cole et al. 2014), but at higher costs when considering large-scale field sampling and monitoring. 
More recently, Avio et al. (2015) optimized a new pro -
tocol allowing an extraction yield of microplastics from 
fish tissues ranging between 78 % and 98 %, depending 
on the polymer size. This protocol integrates previously used extraction methods with slight modifications. Each sample was added to 250 ml NaCl hypersaline solution (1.2 g cm
-3), stirred and decanted for 10 min; 
the filtration step was carried out twice in order to obtain a better extraction performance. The mem -
branes with retained materials were then transferred in a petri dish with a 15 % H
2O2 solution for the partial 
digestion of residual organic matter and allowed to dry in an oven (50°C, overnight), before observation using a microscope. FT-IR spectra for particles analysed before and after the new extraction procedure were comparable, with a similarity of approximately 93 % for 
polyethylene profiles, and greater than 87 % for poly -
styrene. 
7.4 D etection and analytical techniques
Visual examination is the most common method used to assess size and quantities of microplastics, although it can have a relatively high error rate (Loder et al. 2015). Various imaging approaches, such as zooscan (Gilfillan et al. 2009) or semi-automated methods (flow/cyto-meter, cell sorter, coulter counters) may be practical for the visualization or counting of microplastic particles, with the potential to enable large numbers of samples to be analysed rapidly. For a better identification of plastics, specific criteria can be applied, such as the presence of cellular or organic structures, the constant thickness of fragments or fibres, homogeneous colours and plastic brightness. However, the reliability of such approaches has not been evaluated. Other analyses based on visual examination with light, polarized or not, or electron microscopy may provide higher resolution but cannot be used to determine polymer type.
Different characteristics of microplastics may indicate 
possible sources (e.g. from type). It is thus important to use methods that identify the type (pellets, filaments, plastic films, foamed plastic, granules, extruded poly -
styrene foam), shape (cylindrical, disks, flat, ovoid, spheroids etc.), condition (degraded, rough, eroded, broken, presence of fractures) and colour (opaque, clear, pigmented, etc.). 108  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANA detailed analysis of microplastics in various environ -
mental samples requires the identification of chemical 
compounds and polymers. Such methods can confirm that a material is actually plastic. The identity of small pieces of debris is usually confirmed by an additional step, such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) or Raman spectroscopy. FTIR compares the Infra Red spectrum of a sample with spectra of known poly-mers. Infrared spectrophotometry and near-infrared spectrometry enable the identification of common polymers including PP, PE, and polyester. Raman spectroscopy gives information about the crystalline structure of the polymer and may be combined with imaging techniques to identify microplastics in the µm range, and to perform polymer analysis at multiple points on the surface of a sample (Leslie 2011 ). Other methods such as differential scanning calorimetry, smoke characterization after combustion, calculation of specific density, attenuated total reflectance (ATR) FT-IR or “deep Raman” spectroscopy and colour have also been considered, with compromises between sim -
plicity and precision. Other analytical techniques, such as pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Pyr-GC-MS), SEM-EDS and ESEM-EDS, FTA based FT-IR /imaging and thermogravimetry (TGA) have also been used to identify microplastics polymers (Frias et al. 2010; Claessens et al. 2013; Dekiff et al. 2014; Fries et al. 2013; Lenz et al. 2015; Nuelle et al. 2014; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Tagg et al. 2015; Dumichen et al. 2015) and some can also characterize inorganic and organic additives in microplastics fragments (Fries et al. 2013) (Table 7.1).

7.5 D ealing with uncertainty
Regrettably, environmental levels of microplastics may 
be difficult to compare due to the lack of consistency in the assays used and technical challenges. The most common discrepancies can be related to environmen -
tal conditions during sampling, the matrix examined, the extraction protocol (e.g. digestion of tissues), quality analysis/quality control (e.g. procedural con -
tamination of airborne fibres), the particle size-range assessed, the reporting unit and the analytical method used for identification of plastics (Song et al. 2015). It has been demonstrated that analytical methods may be improved in some laboratories. For example, recording colour, width and length of microfibre air -
borne contamination, Torre et al. (2015) minimized the flow of airborne contamination by 95 % using a plastic 
sheet covering a stereo microscope. 
Ecological significance of results is also important for 
consideration. Estimates of the impacts of microplas -
tics are usually conducted in laboratories with only one type or size of microspheres at concentrations much higher than environmental levels and based on short- to mid-term (hours to days) exposures. In addi -
tion, many experiments are done with clean plastic that does not have a biofilm. This is not environmentally realistic. As a result, effects demonstrated may not be environmentally relevant. Long-term chronic exposures under controlled conditions with environmentally rele -
vant microplastics concentrations, types and exposure scenarios are required for a realistic assessment of microplastic-associated risks.
Selecting suitable and comparable quantification and 
identification methods for microplastics is crucial for evaluating concentrations of and risks due to micro -
plastic pollution. The appropriate methods must there -
fore be determined (Song et al. 2015). For example, techniques such as FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy should be adopted globally to help determine particle composition. Visual identification alone is inappropriate for studies on particles below 100 μm. Standardized methodology that is most environmentally relevant will make it possible to better understand contamination and impact. 
7.6 C onclusions, knowledge gaps and 
priorities
7.6.1  Conclusions
M
anagement and reduction measures dedicated to 
microplastics should be based on correct evaluations 
and consistent monitoring. They must also be based on sound scientific and technical basis and strategies. To date, several studies have demonstrated widespread contamination of microplastics in aquatic habitats and organisms, but limitations and inconsistencies in methods have complicated large-scale assessment. As microplastics are increasingly measured in a greater quantity and diversity of environmental matrices, much effort is required to evaluate and improve methods and develop new products and initiatives, such as reference materials, proficiency testing schemes, ring tests, intercalibration exercises and standard operat -
ing protocols  (SOPs). These approaches should be developed in the context of dedicated research and will help to ensure that the quality of the data produced meets predefined performance criteria, which may lead to some form of accreditation. Still, the existing data can still be of use for determining the relative state of the environment and informing decisions on possible management measure. 
7.6.2
 Knowledge gaps
O
ne of the main difficulties for assessing microplas -
tics is due to the lack of standardization of sampling 
and extraction methods for microplastic particles. As sampling, extraction and detection methods and tech -
niques are being developed worldwide, a harmoniza -
tion and standardization of techniques and protocols is urgently needed. This will help achieve quality control. 
7.6.3
 Research priorities
F
urther research on methods needs to consider sam -
pling design in terms of (i) the number and the size of 
replicates, (ii) the spatial area and the frequency of sampling, (iii) the method used for sampling (i.e. type of net for aquatic samples or core for sediment samples), and (iv) methods used for identification of microplastics (Rocha-Santos and Duarte 2015). 
Although some methods have been proven useful tech -
niques for monitoring (Galgani 2014; Masura 2015) and 
identifying the composition of microparticles (Dumichen et al. 2015), the following points have become critical:
•	There is still a lack of analytical methods capable of characterizing and quantifying small sized particles, < 20 to 30 µm diameter, 
including nanoparticles from environmental samples and consequently assessing their concentration. 
•	There is a need to harmonize procedures to mitigate airborne contamination. Only in this way the correct levels of microplastic contamination in biota (which is essential for risk assessment) can be determined in a reproducible and science-based manner. In addition, effort should be directed at how to convert legacy data sets to the new har -
monized units. This will allow decadal scale comparisons and analysis of trends that can -
not be achieved in any other way.
•	Better understanding of degradation pro -
cesses will enable researchers to define chemical indicators, not only for the time-span of polymers at sea, but also to evaluate the rates of degradation and the leachability of pollutants. 
•	More generally, research will have to focus on developing new tools and strategies in order to optimize sampling effort (consid -
ering spatial and temporal variability), and adequately count and characterize micro -
plastics particles.
•	Working at oceanic scale requires assess -
ments to be relevant, supporting the devel -
opment of automated sensors and real time measurements. This will support in situ anal -

  T
he assessment can be focused on a single protection goal or widen to include several ecosystem 
components
8.1 R isk, consequence and likelihood
In simple terms risk is defined as the likelihood (or probability) that a consequence (or hazard) will occur. Terms such as likelihood and consequence may be more familiar to a non-technical audience, whereas probability and hazard are terms that may be preferred by specialists. It is an approach that is routinely applied in every aspect of human activity, ranging from formal risk assessments, for example in major construction projects, to informal decision-making by individuals, for example on when to cross a busy road. Risk = likelihood/probability x consequence/hazard
In the context of marine microplastics, the hazard is the potential impact of plastic particles and the likelihood is the extent or rate of encounter, otherwise referred to as the exposure. The earlier sections of this report describe the source and distribution of the hazard (and microplastics), and the potential impact. Estimating the degree of risk provides a more robust basis for deci -
sions on whether or how to act to reduce the risk, if it is considered unacceptable.
Box 8.1 Definitions under the risk assessment framework
Definition of riskRisk can be defined as the characteristic of a situation or action in which two or more unknown outcomes are pos -
sible, one of which is undesirable (after Covello and Merkhofer 1993).Definition of hazardHazard can be defined as an agent, medium, process, procedure or site with the potential to cause an adverse effect 
(EC 2000). A hazard produces a risk only if an exposure pathway exists and if exposures create the possibility of adverse consequences (Covello and Merkhofer 1993).
Definition of probabilityProbability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. In statistical analysis probability is given a value 
between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating higher probability of occurrence of the event. In the present context the event represents a hazard, and the assigned probability may be qualitative (e.g. based on expert judgement) rather than fully quantitative, due to a lack of empirical evidence. This introduces an additional uncertainty  in the risk 
assessment.
The risk of a significant impact occurring will vary depending on the ecosystem component being assessed, the nature of the hazard and the likelihood of the hazard occurring. GESAMP carried out a risk assessment and risk communication study for coastal aquaculture, in which potential hazards associated with water quality were described in some detail (GESAMP 2008). Hazards were ranked from negligible to cata -
strophic, and accompanied by a description of the effects (Table 8.1). GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  111
Table 8.1 Description of hazards in relation to aquaculture (adapted from GESAMP 2008)
Degree of hazard Description of hazard
Catastrophic •	Irreversible change to ecosystems performance at the faunal-province [regional] level; or
•	The extinction of a species or rare habitat
High •	High mortality for an affected species or significant changes in the function of an eco -
system
•	Effects would be expected to occur at the level of a single coastal or oceanic body
•	Effects would be felt for a prolonged period after the culture activities stop (greater than 
the period which the new species was cultured or three generations of the wild species whichever is the lesser time period)
•	Changes would not be amenable to control or mitigation
Moderate •	Change in ecosystem performance or species performance at a regional or sub-popula -
tion level, but they would not be expected to affect whole ecosystems
•	Changes associated with these effects would be reversible
•	Changes that have a moderately protracted consequence
•	Changes may be amenable to control or mitigation at a significant cost or their effects may be temporary
Low •	Changes are expected to affect the environment and species at a local level but would be expected to have a negligible effect at the regional or ecosystem scale
•	Changes would be amenable to mitigation or control
•	Effects would be of a temporary nature
Negligible •	Changes expected to be localized to the production site and to be of a transitory nature
•	Changes are readily amenable to control or mitigation
The hazard descriptions can be adapted readily for other ecosystem components, for example:
•	Injury or death to endangered species

8.2 R isk assessment
Risk assessment is a useful tool for systematically evaluating and organizing information, and the associ -
ated assumptions/uncertainties, to facilitate the under -standing of relationships between stressors and eco -
logical effects. Environmental risk assessments focus on evaluating the likelihood of adverse environmental or ecological effects resulting from one or more anthro -
pogenic environmental stressors (GESAMP 2008). Risk assessments generally follow a similar set of steps, and a variety of conceptual frameworks have been proposed to illustrate this process. These tend to have a number of common features, beginning with problem identification and formulation (risk identification), fol -
lowed by a characterization of exposure and effect (risk analysis). This allows a societal decision to be made as to whether the risk is considered acceptable or unac -
ceptable (risk evaluation) (GESAMP 2008). If the risk is deemed unacceptable then options for reducing the risk can be considered (risk treatment or risk manage -
ment). This forms part of the Response component of the DPSIR conceptual framework (Section 1.3).
More formally, McVicar (2004) described risk analysis 
as:
 … a structured approach used to identify and evaluate the likelihood and degree of risk associated with a known hazard. It leads to the implementation of practical management action designed to achieve a desired result regarding protection from the hazard. Actions taken should be proportionate to the level of the risk. This provides a rational and defend-able position for any measures taken to allow meaningful use of resources and for the focus to be on the most important areas that can be controlled. Risk management requires that all possible major hazards to the matter of con-cern should be identified. 112  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANA risk matrix can be developed to illustrate the strength 
of a hazard (or effect) and the probability or likelihood of the occurrence of the effect (or concentration), for a particular environmental stressor and ecosystem com -
ponent (Figure 8.2); for example, the impact of PBDE flame-retardants associated with ingested microplas -tics on the reproductive success of oceanic seabirds. Transfer of PBDEs from ingested plastics into adipose tissue of the short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus tenuiros -
tris) has been supported by analysis of PBDE cogeners 
(Tanaka et al. 2013).

(based on Fletcher 2015, Astles 2015) 
From the above discussion it can be seen that it is not appropriate to consider the risk from microplastics as a single entity. The hazards associated with microplas -
tics will have physical, chemical and biological aspects, and their potential impact on the ecosystem will be species dependent, as well as varying spatially and temporally. For illustrative purposes, Table 8.2 presents a summary of hypothetical  potential hazards associ-
ated with the ingestion of microplastics containing potentially hazardous chemicals, added during manu -facture, by a species of finfish. In this case the hazard is characterized by the known endocrine-disrupting prop -
erties of some additives, with the potential to affect the viability of the commercial fish stock and the availability of seafood that is safe to eat. It is possible to produce hazard tables for a range of ecosystem components and microplastic characteristics, based on a combina -
tion of observations, laboratory experiment and expert elicitation. But, it is very difficult to assign probabilities of occurrence with the present level of knowledge.

In theory a risk matrix could be developed to cover all probable occurrences and severities, in combination with a description of the hazard (Table 8.2), and used to illustrate what level of risk is considered unacceptable (Figure 8.3). In practice, as demonstrated in Sections 2 to 6 above, we lack much of the information required, but the matrix is still a useful tool for exploring the prob -
ability of effects.

8.3 Conceptual framework
Risk Assessment Frameworks provide a means of 
formalizing the process of examining a system in con -
text, describing possible consequences if a failure in the system occurs and predicting the likelihood of a failure occurring (Figure 8.4). Evaluating the context is an essential first step (Fletcher 2015). This requires communication and consultation with those individual or organizational stakeholders who may be directly or indirectly affected, a process which should be main -
tained throughout. The risk assessment consists of three stages: risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation. A decision can then be made on the best way to treat this risk. The overall environmental system and risk assessment process need to be monitored and kept under review so that adjustments can be made as new information becomes available. The description of the approach, and the examples given in Figure 8.5, were developed as part of the UNEP report on marine plastics and microplastics for the UNEA-2 (UNEP 2016). This material is reproduced here to provide context although the reader is encouraged to consult the UNEA report. 114  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN

to as risk management (taken from UNEP 2016)
One difference between assessing the impacts of 
macro- and microplastic debris is that the former tends to be easier to demonstrate when it occurs. A turtle suffering injury of death as a result of becoming entangled in ALDFG needs little further explanation to illustrate the nature of the hazard and the degree of risk. Public perceptions of the degree of risk from microplastics are more likely to be influenced by more general considerations of potential hazards which are less readily understood; for example, levels of chemical or radioactive contamination which are declared ‘safe’ by politicians, industry spokespeople or ‘experts’, but where there is a lack of confidence in official assuranc -
es. This disparity between perceived and actual risk is well illustrated by the case of radioactive contamination of seafood following the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident in 2011, as a consequence of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.
8.4 C ase studies
As yet there appear to be no published studies of microplastic impacts that have used a formal risk assessment approach. However, an illustration of how the framework can be applied more generally to float -
ing plastic is provided in Figure 8.5, using information provided in a publication by Wilcox et al. (2015) in which the risk to turtles was assessed from floating ALDFG in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia.
Although the research on microplastics is increasing 
rapidly many data gaps exist that prevent the comple -
tion of a full risk assessment (Van der Meulen et al. 2014). However, we can learn a great deal by using the framework to outline potential risks and to identify the most pressing research needs. The application of the framework to a hypothetical case of bivalve aquaculture is presented in Figure 8.6. The risk is to the human population from consumption of shellfish contamination by chemicals associated with ingested microplastics. In this example it is assumed that con -
taminant levels will be elevated over ‘background’ levels but within national or international (FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius) guidelines; i.e. the potential health risk to human consumers is considered within accept -
able limits, as defined by more familiar risk assessment methods used for hazardous chemicals. However, in this case risk treatment is considered justified by the probability that consumers will change their purchasing preferences because of a perception that the seafood is ‘unsafe’. 
There are costs and benefits associated with most food 
consumption. It is necessary to balance the assured benefits of fish consumption with the potential risk due to seafood contamination. However, misguided perceptions that exaggerate the likelihood of harm may result in a cost to the consumer in terms of removing a wholesome source of protein and energy. This empha -
sizes the need for clear, trustworthy, objective and unambiguous communication of the potential risks and benefits involved (FAO 2014).GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEAN  ·  115

8.5 C onclusions, knowledge gaps and 
priorities
8.5.1  Conclusions
T
he field of risk assessment is quite mature. However, 
it has not been systematically applied to assess the 
impact of microplastics in the marine environment. It is important to acknowledge the challenges in con -
ducting a risk assessment of this nature. Microplastic impacts are likely to be sub-lethal (i.e. they will compro -
mise individual fitness rather than cause death) and will interact with other stressors (e.g. other pollutants, cli -
mate change) creating cumulative effects which could be additive or synergistic. This will make it difficult to tie observed organismal and ecosystem impacts to one stressor. However, development of a framework for both organismal and human risk, that includes all of the factors affecting exposure and impact, would still be valuable to identify the most urgent research needs and management actions moving forward. It has been argued that the precautionary approach should be applied in the case of marine plastics and micro -
plastics; i.e. there is sufficient information available to warrant taking action to reduce inputs and exposure, even though we lack thorough quantitative evidence (UNEP 2016). In the present context, there are several aspects to assessing the risk of an effect that include ecological, social (including human health) and eco -
nomic components.
8.5.2
  Knowledge gaps
T
here is a lack of quantitative information about the 
physical and chemical impacts of microplastics, and 
their associated chemicals, on marine organisms. The presence of microplastics in a wide range of taxa has been demonstrated but it is not clear to what extent this compromises individuals or populations. Without such information it is very challenging to ascribe the level of risk associated with a particular loading of microplastics. 
The degree to which chemicals associated with ingest -
ed plastics transfer across the gut and contaminate 
the organisms is largely unknown. This is a critical gap that prevents the understanding of the extent to which plastics add to the body burdens of such chemicals in organisms, and hence add to the risk of ingestion of contaminants in seafood. There have been attempts to apply theoretical approaches to bridge this gap (Koelmans et al. 2016) but uncertainties remain about the assumptions that such approaches require, espe -
cially given differences in the physiology, anatomy and metabolism of different organisms at varying trophic levels. 116  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANStakeholders:

9 K EY CONCLUSIONS
There has been increasing attention paid to the occur -
rence and impacts of microplastics within the past 
decade, by NGOs, researchers, policy makers, inter -
national agencies, regional seas organizations, funding bodies and the media. This has been accompanied by a marked increase in the number of publications in both the peer-reviewed and ‘grey’ literature. In this report we have reviewed the literature in an attempt to synthesize the current weight of evidence to make our under -
standing regarding microplastic debris available to key stakeholders, including managers and policy makers. Below are some key conclusions from our report. 
Sources
There are many sources of microplastics to the marine 
environment, including terrestrial and maritime, and there is evidence that microplastics are littered into the environment at all steps in the lifecycle of a plas -
tic product, from production to waste management. Microplastics can enter the marine environment via riverine systems, coastlines, directly at sea from ves -
sels and platforms or by wind-induced transport in the atmosphere. Broadly, sources of microplastics are cat -
egorized into two types: primary and secondary. The distinction is based on whether the particles were origi -
nally manufactured to be that size (primary) or whether they have resulted from the breakdown of larger items (secondary). Fragmentation and degradation plays an essential role in the formation of secondary microplas -
tics, but the processes remain poorly understood. 
Distribution, fate and ‘hot-spots’
Understanding the sources, fate and transport of 
microplastics in the marine environment is a growing field and increasingly important to guide management decisions. The fate and transport of microplastics is complex and driven by myriad factors includ -
ing: weathering and fragmentation, winds, buoyancy (plastics properties), local and large-scale currents, wave action and biofouling. Understanding fluxes of microplastics and hot-spots of microplastics distribu -
tion requires understanding movement between these compartments. Microplastics are distributed between the ocean surface, the water column, the seafloor, the shoreline and in biota. The physical, chemical and biological processes acting on the microplastics within each reservoir or compartment differ. Due to lack of data for most of the compartments, the risks and opportunities for mitigation are poorly understood at present. Harmonizing the multiple existing approaches to sampling, measuring and quantifying microplastics will improve local, regional and global understanding and support much-needed, large-scale syntheses. 
Ecological impacts 
Microplastics have been documented in a diversity of 
habitats and in over 100 species of biota. Microplastics can impact an organism at many levels of biological organization. Still, the majority of the evidence is for sub-organismal effects (e.g. changes in gene expres -sion, inflammation, tumour promotion) or effects on individual organisms (i.e. death). Microplastics can present a physical hazard, but can also be a source of hazardous chemicals to organisms. The importance of microplastics as a source of chemicals relative to others (e.g. water, sediment, diet) remains under investigation. Microplastics can also act as a vector for invasive species, including harmful algal blooms and pathogens. Nano-sized plastics are probably as com -
mon as micro-sized plastics, yet the hazards are less understood and may be more complex. 
Commercial fish and shellfish
Capture fisheries and aquaculture sectors provide an 
important protein source that may be negatively affect -
ed by microplastic pollution. Microplastics have been documented in finfish, shellfish and crustaceans, which are consumed by humans. The impacts of the con -
sumption of microplastics by food fish are unknown; however, studies on non-commercial species suggest microplastics have the potential to negatively affect organism health, and hence food security although at current observed concentrations this appears to be unlikely. It is possible that microplastics may increase the chemical contamination of seafood, but there is little evidence to suggest that this represents a sig -
nificant increase in risk to human health at the current observed microplastic concentrations. 
Socio-economic aspects
There is growing concern, globally and by sector, 
about the increasing cost both of inaction and action needed across the value chain. Whilst the benefits of action against macroplastics often outweigh their costs, downstream clean-up actions for microplastics are unlikely to be cost-effective. It is in the interests of those employed in many sectors of the economy to find strategies to reduce marine litter, as this can help reduce social and economic burdens. Examples include: tourism and recreation, aquaculture and fish -
eries, and shipping. In parallel, citizen consumption of goods and services, personal habits (e.g. use of reus -
able bags and packaging) and waste practices (litter -
ing, waste separation) are a key driver of marine litter.
Mitigating the effects of marine litter can benefit com -
munities (e.g. through awareness raising, education), 
support long-term livelihoods (e.g. links to fisheries or tourism), well-being (e.g. linked to recreation) and social cohesion (e.g. sense of belonging to a clean environment). A range of factors influence percep -
tions and behaviour, such as: cultural norms, gender, social standing, education level and economic status. Accounting for these in the design and implementa -
tion of measures to encourage behaviour change may result in longer lasting, more effective and lower-cost solutions. The overarching need is for plastic and its value to be kept within the economy and out of the seas, via a range of circular economy measures. This will help avoid the costs of their impacts on health, environment, society and the economy118  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANMethod development and harmonization
In many cases, environmental levels of microplastics 
may be difficult to interpret due to the lack of consis -
tency in the assays used and technical challenges. A number of factors may effect observations of the distribution of microplastics in the environment, includ -
ing spatial and temporal variability, types of particles, proximity to rivers, variety of approaches, sampling methods, size limits, extraction methods, characteriza -
tion and reporting units. Obtaining a ‘representative’ sample can be problematic. As sampling, extraction, detection methods and techniques are developed worldwide, a harmonization and standardization of techniques and protocols is urgently needed to better assess risk in a reproducible manner, and assist in data comparisons.An initial risk assessment framework
Adopting a risk-based approach provides a robust 
basis for estimating the impact of microplastics and deciding on an appropriate response. Risk is typically placed into one of five categories, from negligible to very high/catastrophic. A risk assessment framework includes analysis of the context in which the hazard occurs, the risk assessment, an evaluation of options for treating the risk, communication with relevant stakeholders throughout the process and monitoring and assessment.

To use a combination of workshops, teleconferencing and inter-sessional work, including the WG40 Basecamp site 
administered by IMO
ToR Approach
1 Identify probable ‘hot-spots’ of land- and sea-based sources for plastic and microplastics, using a combination of targeted modelling, knowledge of actual and potential sources (e.g. coastal tourism, aquaculture, fisheries, riverine inputs, urban inputs), environmental and societal data. This can help to inform the development of effective measures in other regions
2 Include coastal-open ocean scaling, 3D circulation, varying particle properties (e.g. size, density). To contribute to a modelling workshop involving a wider group of modellers to improve current assess -
ment methodologies
3 Combine field observations of commercial species, trophic transfer, laboratory experiments of uptake and effects, engagement with the shellfish and fisheries industry (regional cases), consumer prefer -
ence, potential human health implications
4 Combine collation and analysis of field observations with modelling and sources
5 Critically review laboratory-based experiments examining the behaviour and potential effects of nano -
plastics and assess their relevance to the natural environment. Improve sampling and detection meth -
ods for nano-sized plastic particles, particularly in biota. Include expertise on human and non-human physiology, biomedicine and toxicology; nano-sciences and nano-engineering in future assessments.
6 Compare information from laboratory-based experiments of organism-chemical behaviour with field-based observations. Include expertise on animal behaviour and physiology for target species, including important commercial species. Take account of gut retention times and the conditions inside the gut when assessing risk. Include a consideration of particle size and shape when assessing risk of dam -
age.
7 Review the published evidence on NIS introductions and potential vectors (e.g. ship hull transfer, bal -
last water transfer), to estimate the relative importance of plastics and microplastics as a transport vector. Review epidemiological evidence for the occurrence of outbreaks of pathogenic disease asso -
ciated with NIS. Undertake a targeted risk assessment based on existing data on NIS introductions and disease outbreaks, and utilize existing circulation models to identify key transport routes for patho -
genic organisms and the conditions favourable for growth.
8 Review existing and developing standards, assess common usage, identify weaknesses in current defi -
nitions and methodologies, propose new guidelines for review by the wider scientific community. 
9 Compile regionally resolved socio-economic data relating to sources and effects of plastics and micro -
plastics, including individual and organizational attitudes. Work with local/regional public and private sector organizations, NGOs, special interest and citizens groups including using the GPML. 
10 Engage with communications experts within the sponsoring and participant’s organization, as well as external experts, to help define and develop appropriate channels for effective communication of all aspects of the study to a range of target groups (policy/governance, private sector, media, public, research community)

SECTOR
Much of the existing legislation as well as providing 
guidelines on what waste can or cannot be discarded at sea, also provides guidelines on waste manage -
ment practices. For example, the MARPOL Convention (IMO, 2015 #338) provides guidance and regulations on the implementation of port reception facilities as well as training and education on the issue. It also stipulates how garbage should be managed at sea, including the use of placards, garbage management plans, record books, incinerators and control of cargo residues (Øhlenschlæger, 2013 #437).
In addition to legislation, a number of voluntary schemes 
exist which provide further guidelines on waste man -
agement at sea. The International Organization for Standardisation (ISO) has two standards relevant to MARPOL V, specifically for ships
19 and ports.20 Similarly, 
the Blue Angel offers a label for “environmentally sound” ship operations
21 (RAL gGmbH, 2010). Further 
certification or guidance may be available to specific industries such as for the Clean Shipping Index  (CSI)
22 
for container ships or the role of the trade association Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA)
23 for the 
cruise industry. There is no obligation for ships or ports to follow these standards and there may be costs for implementation and certification but they may also pro -
vide competitive advantage. In addition, specific vessel operators may make strategies to further differentiate themselves in the market or express their commit -
ment to stewardships in the marine environment.
24,25 
However, some of these certifications and strategies have come under criticism for not being more ambi -
tious than the minimum requirements of maritime law (Sherrington, 2014 #401@30), in addition the parity between certification and practice is not guaranteed (Klein, 2011 #355). With regards to marine plastics, not all of the certifications programmes are explicit about the role of plastics, and rather refer to waste in general terms.
19 ISO 21070:2011 Management and handling of shipboard 
garbage (ISO, 2011).
20 ISO 16304:2013 Arrangement and management of port 
waste reception facilities (ISO, 2013)
21 Requirements 3.3.5 Waste Disposal; 3.3.6 Waste Incineration; 
and 3.3.16 Environmentally Sound Recycling all refer to waste 
management on ships. In addition to the guidelines included in MARPOL, they recommend actions such as purchasing strate-gies with aim towards avoiding waste. 
22 CSI provides a tool for cargo operators to calculate and 
minimize the carbon footprint of their vessels. One of the envi-ronmental parameters of the CSI is for waste control, although it is not apparent that its requirements go beyond those laid out in MARPOL V.
23 Membership to the CLIA 
24 E.g. MATSON Navigation a shipping operator in the Pacific 
Ocean have a Zero Waste Policy, including a number of further waste related projects. This involved an initial investment of $224,000 to include a container designed for storing waste on board each of their vessels (MATSON, 2014). 
25 E.g. Royal Caribbean Cruises have published a number of 
reports reporting on their commitment to environmental stew-ardship, including indicators on waste to land fill, recycling etc. (Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., 2014)Port reception facilities are one of the most impor -
tant tools for addressing waste generated at sea 
from all sectors, and if appropriately designed can incentivise best practices (Newman, 2015 #376). Well-designed port reception facilities will encourage ship -
pers to dispose of their waste correctly, relying on clear waste definitions, communication between actors, timely administration and appropriate inspections (Øhlenschlæger,  2013 #437). MARPOL V requires the provision of facilities for the reception of ship gener -
ated residues and litter (IMO, 2012 #336@25). The IMO have also published a Comprehensive Manual on Port Reception Facilities (IMO, 1999 #334), giving guidance on waste management strategies, types of waste, col -
lecting and treating waste, financing and cost recov -
ery. Since 2006 the IMO have also integrated a port reception facility module, or the Port Reception Facility Database (PRFD) into their Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) (IMO, 2015 #337). 
Awareness-raising can also help to reduce shipping 
related marine litter impacts and costs by highlight -
ing the costs to stakeholders in both socio-economic and environmental terms. For instance, the shipping industry now has compulsory training on marine litter, following leverage from the Dutch Government and the ProSea Foundation on the IMO to amend the STWC (International Convention on Standards of Training) (ProSea, 2011 #388). Such training, as well as the enforcement of good practices will also be associated with a number of costs, which would also need to be included in a socio-economic assessment.

Taxes and levies on single-use plastics
In a number of countries, levies on e.g. single-use 
plastic bags have helped reduce the number of these items. The Irish plastic bag levy is a widely discussed and cited example of the successful application of an economic instrument. After introducing a €0.15 levy on retail plastic bags, sales in retail outlets dropped by  90%. The levy was also very cost-effective, as stores could use the existing Value Added Tax scheme for collecting and reporting the levy (Convery et al. 2007; Pape et al. 2011).A recent study commissioned by the Welsh Government has shown that, since the introduction of the levy in 2011, the SUCB (single use carrier bag) use has declined by 71%. Wales was the first nation of the UK to introduce a levy on the use of SUCB (Welsh Government 2015). In addition, the report shows that the impact of the levy on retailers has been either neutral, or positive. Consumers’ support of the levy, already strong in 2011 (61%) has been growing and has reached now 74% of the whole population.210  ·  GESAMP REPORTS & STUDIES No. 93 – MICROPLASTICS IN THE OCEANDeposit Schemes are Applicable at Different Scales
Australia
When discussing options for reducing litter reaching 
the marine environment, large-scale solutions such as state- or country-wide deposit schemes come into mind. For example, Hardesty et al. (2014) report that South Australia’s container deposit scheme, which applies a AUS $0.10 refundable deposit to beverage containers, resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the number of beverage containers lost to beaches.
However, this instrument can in principle be applied 
at all scales and most locations. Hardesty (2015, oral communication) is reporting an initiative at the Boronia West Primary school in Victoria, Australia, where the school introduced a 10 cent deposit on candy wrap -
pers sold at the school refectory.
The idea originated from the children themselves just 
after learning about the impacts of litter on the marine environment, notably by following a class with a post-mortem examination of seabirds with plastic material in their stomachs. The children could then connect the impact of litter on wildlife with their school envi -
ronment, where littering does occur and where candy wrappers are often found on the schoolyard. The deposit scheme is now in place and has been extended to a second school.

scheme/ Ecuador charge on plastic bottles
In 2011, purchasers of plastic beverage bottles were charged with a refundable tax of $0.02 per PET bottle. This has led to a significant increase in PET bottle recycling from 30% in 2011 to 80% in 2012, when 1.13 million of PET bottles were recycled out of 1.40 million produced.

ANNEX VI – EXAMPLES OF LITTER REDUCTION MEASURES
Table A VI.1 Measures addressing marine litter issues from tourism – from prevention to clean-up
Type of measure Example from practice
Pier-side reception facilities In several US states, pier-side reception facilities are provided for safe disposal of 
monofilament line by recreational fishers. Collected fishing gear is subsequently recycled (Macfadyen 2009). For example, the Reel in and Recycle scheme, launched by Boat U.S. Foundation and sponsored by NOAA and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Boat U.S. Foundation, has the intention to reduce marine litter by recy -
cling the materials, raising awareness as well as monitoring the waste collected. Within its first four years, the scheme installed over 1,200 bins across 32 states in the US, with a continued growing interest and demand (Shingledecker, 2010 #402).
Awareness raising and tar -
geted education campaignsThe Green Blue initiative in the UK led by The Royal Yachting Association & The British Marine Federation raises awareness of marine litter among the recreational boating community, providing education, solutions and toolkits.
The Special Monitoring and Coastal Environmental Assessment Regional Activity 
Centre of the Northwest Pacific Action Plan (NOWPAP CEARAC) developed marine litter guidelines for tourists and tour operations in marine and coastal areas which set out best practices for tourists participating in marine recreational activities (e.g. cruising, fishing and diving) and coastal recreational activities (e.g. camping, barbequing and bathing) as well as suggested actions for tour operators to reduce tourist-generated marine litter (NOWPAP CEARAC, 2011 #378).
The Travel Corporation (an international travel group with a number of established 
brands such as Contiki Tours) established The TreadRight Foundation to encourage sustainable tourism within its family of brands. This Foundation supports a number of projects across the world including a partnership between Contiki’s conservation programme – Contiki Cares – and Surfrider Foundation Australia which sponsors a number of beach clean-ups along the coast, and awareness raising activities.
26 
TreadRight’s has supported the production and subsequent distribution of a docu -
mentary – ‘Scars of Freedom’ – which chronicles a whale’s fight for life off the coast of Chile’s Juan Fernandez Archipelago after getting caught in drift net.
27
UNEP launched the Marine Litter MOOC (Massive Open Online Course), a large-scale training and educational effort in October 2015. With the focus to stimulate leadership and offer opportunities for actionable and change oriented learning related to marine litter, this course had more than 5000 signups within two weeks of the launch.
The main objectives of the MARLISCO project (involving 15 European countries, 
http://www.marlisco.eu/) were to increase the awareness of the consequences of societal behaviour in relation to waste production and management on marine socio-ecological systems, to promote co-responsibility among the different actors, to define a more sustainable collective vision, and to facilitate grounds for concerted actions through the successful implementation of the MMLAP.

Sustainable tourism  
initiativesMembers of The Caribbean Hotel Association (CHA) established The Caribbean 
Alliance for Sustainable Tourism (CAST) which aims to promote responsible environ -
mental and social management within the hotel and tourism sector. CAST focuses on the development of sustainable tourism certification and standards, provides guidance and expertise in awareness raising programmes, environmental manage -
ment systems (EMS) and best practices to support sustainable tourism.
28 
In Barbados, Green Globe Certified Hotels including Almond Hotel Group, The Bougainvillea, The PomMarine Hotel, The Sand Acres Hotel, The Southern Palms Hotel, The Palm Beach Group, members of the Green Hotels Association of the US and CAST support local programmes for improved solid waste management in beach areas (UNEP-CAR/RCU, 2008 #421).
In 1999, the Roteiros de Charme Hotel Association in Brazil developed a voluntary 
Ethics and Environmental Code of Conduct in co-operation with UNEP’s Tourism Programme which provides a benchmark for biodiversity conservation and the qual -
ity of holiday destinations. Implementation of the code has helped to reduce pres -
sures on the environment for example preventing pollution from untreated sewage and contamination of waterways and marine environments, reducing solid waste generation and inappropriate waste disposal practices, strengthening public aware -
ness and protecting biodiversity.
29
Clean-up activities In the UK, there are a number of voluntary clean-up initiatives such as Adopt-a-Beach which involves local communities, businesses, schools and individuals in reg -
ular beach cleans and surveys, Beach Watch which coordinates regular and a large annual national beach clean activity and marine litter survey organized by the Marine Conservation Society, community beach clean-up projects organized by Surfers Against Sewage and Keep Britain Tidy. Whilst these activities can only access part of the existing problem, they can lead to greater pro-environmental intentions, which in turn can reduce the litter entering the environment (Wyles, revised and resubmit -
ted #435).
Some clean-up activities engage recreational users in both collecting litter and 
recording what is found in a specific area. For example a number of initiatives engage scuba divers such as Neptune’s Army of Rubbish Cleaners, the Green Fins project, Dive Against Debris and Project AWARE (a global movement of scuba divers). Travel Trawl loans equipment to recreational sailors to collect sam -
ples of plastic debris during their own sailing trips and report back to the Algalita Foundation. 
A number of hotels, groups and travel operators are involved in beach clean-up 
activities. For example, in 2014, a multinational travel operator – the TUI Group – organized a series of Big Holiday Beach Clean events worldwide to raise aware -
ness about marine litter among tourists and local authorities (TUI Group, 2014). The Berjaya Hotels & Resorts group in Malaysia supports annual clean-up events on various beaches such as the Redang Island Clean-up Day and Tioman Island.
30 The 
Conrad Hotel Maldives supports regular beach clean-up activities with SubAqua Dive Center and supports improved waste management practices including reduced use of plastic water bottles.
