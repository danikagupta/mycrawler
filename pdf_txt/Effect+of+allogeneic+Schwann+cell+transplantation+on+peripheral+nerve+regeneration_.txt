Abstract
Traumatic peripheral nerve injury is a worldwide clinical issue with high morbidity. The severity ofperipheral nerve injury can be classiﬁed as neurapraxia, axonotmesis or neurotmesis, according to
Seddon’s classiﬁcation, or ﬁve different degrees according to Sunderland’s classiﬁcation. Patientswith neurotmesis suffer from a complete transection of peripheral nerve stumps and are often
in need of surgical repair of nerve defects. The applications of autologous nerve grafts as the
golden standard for peripheral nerve transplantation meet some difﬁculties, including donornerve sacriﬁce and nerve mismatch. Attempts have been made to construct tissue-engineered
nerve grafts as supplements or even substitutes for autologous nerve grafts to bridge peripheral
nerve defects. The incorporation of stem cells as seed cells into the biomaterial-based scaffoldsincreases the effectiveness of tissue-engineered nerve grafts and largely boosts the regenerative
process. Numerous stem cells, including embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells, adipose stem cells, skin-derived precursor stem cells and inducedpluripotent stem cells, have been used in neural tissue engineering. In the current review, recent
trials of stem cell-based tissue-engineered nerve grafts have been summarized; potential concerns
and perspectives of stem cell therapeutics have also been contemplated.
Key words: Peripheral nerve injury, Tissue-engineered nerve grafts, Seed cells, Stem cells, Peripheral nerve regeneration
Background
Peripheral nerve injury is a universal clinical issue with an
estimated incidence of 13.9–23 per 100,000 persons per year[1,2]. Unlike nerves in the central nervous system, nerves in
the peripheral nervous system obtain certain spontaneous
regenerative abilities following nerve injury. Accordingly,the severities and consequences of peripheral nerve injury-
induced neuropathies are generally flexible [ 3]. Patients with
mild peripheral nerve injuries may recover, while patientswith severe peripheral nerve injuries and long nerve defectsoften suffer from impaired motor, sensory and autonomic
nerve functions and are in need of peripheral nerve repairsurgeries. According to the National Center for Health
Statistics based on Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision,
Clinical Modification for the following categories: ICD-9 CMCode: 04.3, 04.5, 04.6, 04.7, more than 50,000 peripheral
nerve repair procedures were performed in the year of 1995
[4]. It is reported that, in the recent year, more than 200,000
patients received peripheral nerve repair procedures, causing
an excessive burden on economy and society [ 5,6].2 Burns & Trauma, 2020, Vol. 8, tkaa002
Review
Anatomy and classiﬁcation of peripheral nerve injury
Peripheral nerve injury, especially traumatic peripheral nerve
injury, is categorized according to a variety of classes orgrades by neuroscientists and surgeons to aid in prognosis
and treatment. In 1943, Sir Herbert Seddon introduced a
classification system and described three classes of peripheralnerve injury—neurapraxia, axonotmesis and neurotmesis
(Figure 1 )—based on the severity of nerve injury, the recovery
time and the prognosis [ 7].
Neurapraxia (class I), a nerve injury commonly induced
by focal demyelination and/or ischemia, is the mildest type
of peripheral nerve injury [ 8]. In neurapraxia, the conduction
of nerve impulses is blocked in the injured area, motor and
sensory connection is lost, but all morphological structures
of the nerve stump, including the endoneurium, perineuriumand epineurium, remain intact. Since the axon is not separated
from the soma in neurapraxia, Wallerian degeneration does
not occur. The injured peripheral nerve generally achievesfull recovery of nerve conduction and function, although
the recovery process may be highly variable, from hours
and days to weeks or even a few months [ 8]. Axonotmesis
(class II) is a comparatively more severe type of peripheral
nerve injury and is normally caused by crush, stretch or
percussion [ 8]. In axonotmesis, the epineurium is intact, while
the perineurium and endoneurium may be disrupted [ 8]. The
axon is separated from the soma and the axon and the myelinsheath are disrupted; Wallerian degeneration occurs in the
axon stump distal to the injury site within 24–36 hours after
peripheral nerve injury. There are sensory and motor deficits,
as well as nerve conduction failure distal to the injury site
in this degree of nerve injury. Remaining surrounding stroma
benefits axonal elongation along the intact tissue framework.Functional recovery can be expected if the injured nerve
stump retains a certain level of integrity of the physiological
structure and organization. The prognosis of axonotmesisalso largely depends on the distance of the site of lesion to
the target organ. However, for most cases, self-regeneration
is extremely limited and appropriate surgical intervention isrequired. Neurotmesis (class III) is caused by nerve transec-
tion or neurotoxins and is the most severe degree of peripheral
nerve injury. In neurotmesis, the entire nerve stump, includingthe endoneurium, perineurium and epineurium, is completely
severed. Neurotmesis leads to the rupture of axon, myelin
sheath and connective tissues and, correspondingly, results inpoor prognosis.
Sunderland, in 1951, expanded Seddon’s classification,
especially regarding axonotmesis, to five degrees [ 9]. Sunder-
land’s first-degree injury indicates the lowest degree of nerve
injury and is equal to Seddon’s neurapraxia. Sunderland’s
second-, third- and fourth-degree injuries are equal to
Seddon’s axonotmesis. In Sunderland’s second-degree injury,
the endoneurial tubes, perineurium and epineurium remainintact, although the axon is disrupted. In Sunderland’s
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the classiﬁcation of peripheral nerve injury. The severity of peripheral nerve injury is classiﬁed as class I (neurapra xia),
class II (axonotmesis) or class III (neurotmesis) by Seddon and ﬁrst- to ﬁfth-degree by SunderlandBurns & Trauma, 2020, Vol. 8, tkaa002 3
third-degree injury, besides the disruption of axon at
the injured site, the continuities of the endoneurium and
perineurium are also lost. In Sunderland’s fourth-degree
injury, only the integrity of the epinurium is left—thecontinuities of the axon, endoneurium and perineurium are
impaired [ 10]. Sunderland’s fifth-degree injury corresponds
to the definition of neurotmesis in Seddon’s classification
and represents the highest degree of nerve injury, with
a complete nerve defect. To avoid excess tension, thesesevere peripheral nerve injuries with long nerve gaps require
nerve graft implantation for surgical intervention instead of
neurorrhaphy [ 11].
Tissue-engineered nerve graft-based treatment of
peripheral nerve injury
The transplantation of autologous nerve graft is the golden
standard for the treatment of severe peripheral nerve injury.Nevertheless, the application of autologous nerve graft has
several critical and insurmountable disadvantages, including
the sacrifice of a healthy donor nerve, limited sources ofdonor nerves, donor site morbidity and donor nerve mis-
match [ 12]. The transplantation of xenogeneic or allogeneic
nerve grafts may solve the issue of limited sources, but may
induce severe immunological problems [ 13]. Under the cir-
cumstances, tissue-engineered nerve grafts have emerged asan effective treatment of severe peripheral nerve injury.
A tissue-engineered nerve graft is an artificial nerve graft
constructed of a biomaterial-based scaffold, seed cells andneurotrophic factors [ 14,15]. The biomaterial-based scaffold
offers a physical structural support for the growth and
elongation of injured nerves. Incorporated seed cells andneurotrophic factors further enhance the therapeutic effect of
the biomaterial-based scaffold [ 16,14]. A variety of materials,
including synthetic materials such as polyglycolic acid andpoly(lactin-co-glycolic acid), as well as natural materials, such
as chitosan, silk fibroin, extracellular matrix components,
polysaccharides and metallic materials, have been used toconstruct neural scaffolds [ 15]. Many neurotrophic factors,
such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic
factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, ciliaryneurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3, are commonly
applied [ 14]. Schwann cells, as the main glial cells in the
peripheral nervous system and the main structural and
functional cells in peripheral nerve regeneration, are utilized
a sn a t u r a ls e e dc e l l s[ 17].
After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells adaptively
respond to axonal interruption, switching from a highly
myelinated state to a de-differentiated state. De-differentiatedSchwann cells engulf axon and myelin debris and form
a regeneration path for axon growth [ 18,19]. Moreover,
activated Schwann cells secrete a group of cytokines,including tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1 αand
leukemia inhibitory factor, to recruit macrophages and
facilitate debris digestion. Schwann cells also secrete agroup of neurotrophic factors, including nerve growth factor,brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor, to encourage neuron survival and axon
elongation [ 20,21,18]. For peripheral nerve injuries with a
long nerve defect (longer than 4–5 cm in human patients),the bio-scaffold alone may not achieve satisfactory repair
effects and the application of Schwann cells or Schwann-
like cells, combined with a nerve graft, is essential [ 16,22].
For instance, it is reported that hollow autogenous venous
nerve conduit can only repair a peripheral nerve defect ofup to 3 cm in length in rabbit or human, while a Schwann
cells-added nerve conduit can repair a 6 cm nerve gap [ 23–
25]. Schwann cells have been also used as excellent seed
cells to promote the regeneration of other types of tissues,
such as skin [ 26]. Nevertheless, the use of Schwann cells in
tissue-engineered nerve grafts has some significantly distinctdrawbacks, including the surgical need to collect autologous
Schwann cells and the difficulty in culturing and expanding
Schwann cells to adequate amount. Although the methodfor culturing Schwann cells has improved and the required
culture time has been shortened, it can still take 2 weeks
to obtain enough Schwann cells, with a high degree ofpurity, for transplantation [ 27,28]. The use of xenogeneic
or allogeneic Schwann cells, on the other hand, may induce
immunological rejection similar as the use of xenogeneic
or allogeneic nerve grafts [ 29]. The effect of allogeneic
Schwann cells has been examined by transplanting nerveconduits filled with allogeneic genetically labeled Schwann
cells. Allogeneic Schwann cells are rejected 6 weeks after
in vivo transplantation without immunosuppressive therapy
[
30].
Compared with Schwann cells, undifferentiated stem cells
have a strong expansion capacity. Stem cells can differentiateto numerous specialized cell types, including Schwann cells.
In addition, a variety of types of stem cells, such as stem cells
taken from umbilical cord blood after birth, bone marrowstem cells and adipose stem cells, can be collected from an
autograft to reduce immunogenicity. Therefore, stem cells
exhibit great clinical potentials and may be used as seedcells for the construction of cell-based tissue-engineered nerve
grafts.
Applications of stem cells in neural tissue engineering
For the generation of stem cell-based tissue-engineered nervegrafts, stem cells are generally isolated, cultured, expanded
and incorporated into a biomaterial-based scaffold in vitro .
The constructed tissue-engineered nerve graft is then sutured
to the injured site to bridge the peripheral nerve defect.
Following nerve graft transplantation, stem cells differentiateinto Schwann-like cells, secrete proteins that can accelerate
axon growth, such as neurotrophic factors and extracellu-
lar matrix components, provide a favorable microenviron-ment and promote myelin formation and nerve regeneration
(Figure 2 ). Stem cells from many different sources have been
applied in neural tissue engineering, and some extensivelyused stem cells are introduced in Table 1 .4 Burns & Trauma, 2020, Vol. 8, tkaa002
Figure 2. Schematic representation of the repair of peripheral nerve damage with a stem cell-based tissue-engineered nerve graft. Stem cells are isolated, cu ltured,
expanded and incorporated into a neural scaffold containing an outer porous nerve conduit and numerous inner luminal ﬁllers to construct a stem cell- based
tissue-engineered nerve graft. Implanted stem cells differentiate into Schwann cells, secrete neurotrophic factors and promote peripheral nerve regeneration
Embryonic stem cells Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent
stem cells that can differentiate to all three embryonic germlayers and form all types of cells or tissues of the body,
except for fetal cells. Neurospheres derived from human
embryonic stem cells can differentiate to cells with morpho-logical and molecular features of Schwann cells and physical
interactions with axons [ 31]. Schwann cells differentiated
from human embryonic stem cells can not only expressSchwann cell markers, glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100
and p75, but also induce the myelination of dorsal root
ganglia neurons [ 32]. The direct microinjection of mouse
embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells into the
surrounding epineurium as a natural conduit after a 1 cm
rat sciatic nerve transection leads to extensive morphologi-cal and functional recovery. Injected stem cells survive and
differentiate to myelin-forming cells up to 3 months after
cell transplantation [ 33]. Neural crest cells derived from
human embryonic stem cells produce a range of bioactive
trophic factors, stimulate the outgrowth of neurites when co-cultured with neurons in vitro and promote the regeneration
of injured rat sciatic nerves when seeded into a biodegradable
nerve conduit to bridge peripheral nerve gaps in vivo [34].
Besides embryonic stem cells, many other fetal-derived stem
cells, including amniotic tissue-derived stem cells, umbilical
cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells and Wharton’s Jellymesenchymal stem cells, are also applied in stem cell-based
nerve regeneration therapies [ 35].
However, embryonic stem cells have tumorigenic prop-
erties and may induce the formation of teratomas [ 36,37].
In addition, the usage of embryonic stem cells poses ethical
uncertainty. Adult stem cells, on the contrary, generally do
not trigger ethical controversy and are considered as suitableseed cells in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
Neural stem cells Neural stem cells, as the primordial cells in
the nervous system, are an essential cell source of neurons andglial cells and an important cell source for nerve regeneration
[38]. Transplanted neural stem cells in injured peripheral
nerves can differentiate into neurons and Schwann-like cells;
secrete many critical neurotrophic factors, such as brain-
derived neurotrophic factor, fibroblast growth factor, nervegrowth factor, insulin-like growth factor and hepatocyte
growth factor; and encourage angiogenesis, nerve growth and
myelin formation [ 39]. Neural stem cells can be embedded
and expanded in a neurotrophin-3 composited hyaluronic
acid–collagen conduit. The transplantation of the neural
stem cell-based nerve conduit to a transected rabbit facialnerve increases the voltage amplitude of electromyography
and facilitates facial nerve repair [ 40]. A comparison study
shows that neural stem cell-combined nerve conduits exhibitBurns & Trauma, 2020, Vol. 8, tkaa002 5

a similar regenerative effect as nerve autografts and a
better regenerative effect than nerve conduits without seed
cells when repairing a 10 mm rabbit facial nerve defect[41]. Engineered neural stem cells that over-express glial
cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, as compared with
normal neural stem cells, exhibit even better regenerativeabilities in repairing both acute and chronic peripheral nerve
injury [ 42,43]. A mechanism study showed that implanted
neural stem cells increase the abundance of IL12p80, whichstimulates Schwann cell differentiation and promotes the
functional recovery of injured peripheral nerves [ 44]. In spite
of the encouraging repairing effects of neural stem cells, theclinical use of neural stem cells may be limited by the difficulty
in collecting them and the possibility of tumor formation [ 45].
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells Mesenchymal stem
cells are multipotent adult stem cells that can be found inmany tissues, such as bone marrow, umbilical cord blood,
peripheral blood, fallopian tube and lung. Bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells can be easily collected through theaspiration of the bone marrow in a standardized method and
then expanded on a large scale for subsequent applications.
Moreover, cultured bone marrow mesenchymal stem cellslack immune recognition, have immunosuppressive action
and can be allogenically transplanted without inducing
immune rejection [ 46,47]. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem
cells have been reported as one of the most widely used cell
sources for nerve regeneration.
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate
to Schwann-like cells and boost neurite outgrowth when co-
cultured with neurons [ 48]. Yang et al. showed that seeding
bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells as supporting cells into
a silk fibronin-based nerve conduit increases the expression
of Schwann cell marker S100, elevates the secretion of many6 Burns & Trauma, 2020, Vol. 8, tkaa002
growth factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
ciliary neurotrophic factor and basic fibroblast growth factor,
and supports the histological and functional recovery of rats
with sciatic nerve injury [ 49]. Zhao et al. also demonstrate
that, compared with the plain nerve graft, the acellular nerve
graft supplemented with bone marrow mesenchymal stem
cells exhibits better repairing effects in axon growth, target
muscle preservation and walking track when bridging a
10 mm sciatic nerve defect in mice [ 50].
The promoting effects of bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells on peripheral nerve regeneration may be com-
plex and may not only depend on their differentiationinto Schwann-like cells [ 16]. Elevated immunostaining of
vascular endothelial growth factor is detected after the
application of Schwann-like cells induced from bone marrowmesenchymal stem cells, suggesting that bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells may also contribute to angiogenesis
[51]. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling of injected bone
marrow mesenchymal stem cells reflects that 5% of BrdU
cells express Schwann cell marker [ 52]. Moreover, Chen et al.
found that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells obtainedfrom rat bilateral femurs and tibias grow to fibroblast-
shaped cells instead of Schwann-like cells. Still, bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells secrete many neurotrophic factors,
such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic
factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and ciliaryneurotrophic factor, as well as many extracellular matrix
components, such as collagen, fibronectin and laminin. The
transplantation of a silicone tube containing bone marrowmesenchymal stem cells to a rat sciatic nerve gap improves
rat walking behavior, reduces muscle atrophy and stimulates
axon regeneration [ 53].
Besides rodents, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
have been applied to repair long nerve gaps in larger animals,
such as dogs [ 54] and goats [ 55]. Bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells are also used to treat peripheral nerve injuries in
primates. Schwann cells induced from bone marrow mes-
enchymal stem cells are filled into a biodegradable conduitfilled with collagen sponge to bridge a 20 mm cynomol-
gus monkey median nerve defect. Transplanted cells accel-
erate the growth of axons and the recovery of electrophys-iological parameters without massive cell proliferation or
any observable abnormalities [ 56]. Similarly, another study
revealed that the repairing effect of a chitosan/poly(lactic-co-
glycolic acid)-based autologous bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cell-containing tissue-engineered nerve graft is muchbetter than the plain nerve conduit in repairing a 50 mm
median nerve defect in rhesus monkeys. Implanted autol-
ogous marrow mesenchymal stem cells do not induce anydetectable abnormalities in blood tests or histopathological
examination [ 57].
Adipose stem cells Although the benefits of bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells in peripheral nerve regeneration have
been well demonstrated, the use of bone marrow mesenchy-mal stem cells can be invasive, limited by tissue source andethically controversial [ 58]. Compared with other types of
stem cells, adipose stem cells can be collected by a less invasive
liposure procedure and therefore exhibit great clinical poten-
tial [ 58]. The proliferation and differentiation capabilities of
adipose stem cells are much higher than many other adult
stem cells as well [ 59]. Moreover, adipose stem cells can
be induced into spindle shaped cells that express Schwann
cell markers, secrete neurotrophic factors, stimulate neurite
outgrowth and form myelin sheaths [ 60,61]. These advan-
tages of adipose stem cells make them a good cell source for
transplantation strategies.
For instance, adipose stem cells can be collected from vis-
ceral fat encasing the stomach and intestines and seeded into
a fibrin nerve conduit to construct an adipose stem cell-based
tissue-engineered nerve graft. Morphological and biochem-ical studies demonstrate that implanted adipose stem cells
differentiate into a Schwann cell phenotype. Functional stud-
ies demonstrate that implanted adipose stem cells improvethe mean amplitudes of compound muscle action potential,
the atrophy of target muscle and axonal and fiber diameter
after transplantation to bridge a 1 cm rat sciatic nerve gap.The regenerative effect of an adipose-derived stem cell-seeded
fibrin conduit is similar to the autograft but much better than
a primary Schwann cell-seeded fibrin conduit or a Schwann
cell-like differentiated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
stem cell-seeded fibrin conduit [ 62,63]. In another study,
undifferentiated adipose stem cells or adipose stem cells that
are differentiated into a Schwann cell phenotype are incorpo-
rated into silicone nerve conduits containing type I collagengel to bridge rat facial nerve defects of 7 mm. Both the appli-
cations of undifferentiated and differentiated adipose stem
cells increase myelinated fiber numbers and myelin thicknessand bring functional improvement of facial palsy without
neuroma formation [ 58]. Adipose stem cells are also applied
by embedding adipose stem cells in fibrin glue and coveringthe injured nerve with cell-containing fibrin glue. Fibrin glue
provides additional extracellular support, while adipose stem
cells not only encourage the restoration of blood supply andmotor function, but also retrogradely protect the survival of
dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons [ 64]. It is worth noting
that several factors, such as donor age and harvest site/layer,may affect and even limit the growth properties of adipose
stem cells [ 65–67]. Therefore, to maximize the regenerative
abilities of adipose stem cells, the quality of applied adipose
stem cells should be strictly controlled.
Skin-derived precursor stem cells Skin-derived precursor
cells, similar as adipose stem cells, are easily accessible
adult stem cells. Skin-derived precursor cells are stem cellsderived from the dermis. They can differentiate into various
cell types, including Schwann cells [ 68,69]. The in vitro
co-culture of skin-derived precursor cell-derived Schwanncells and dorsal root ganglia neurons induces myelination,
while the in vivo transplantation of skin-derived precursor
cells or skin-derived precursor cell-derived Schwann cellsto the injured mice sciatic nerve improves dysmyelinatingBurns & Trauma, 2020, Vol. 8, tkaa002 7
disorder [ 70]. To visualize the in vivo status of implanted
skin-derived precursor cells, skin-derived precursor cells
are labeled with Green fluorescent protein (GFP) prior to
seeding into a nerve conduit to bridge a 16 mm rat sciaticnerve gap. The expressions of Schwann cell markers, such
as S100 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, are detected in
some GFP-positive cells around regenerating nerve fibers,
suggesting that skin-derived precursor cells differentiate
into Schwann cells and contribute to a faster recoveryrate of injured peripheral nerves [ 71]. Another study used
tracking dye to label porcine skin-derived mesenchymal stem
cells. Labeled autologous porcine skin-derived mesenchymalstem cells can be well-preserved at 2 and 4 weeks after
seeding to neural scaffolds and transplanting to the injured
sites of miniature pigs [ 72]. The application of skin-
derived precursor cells to a 12 mm rat sciatic nerve defect
increases histomorphometrical and electrophysiological
parameters, reaching a comparable result as those seededwith Schwann cells [ 73]. Moreover, skin-derived precursor
cells can also treat delayed nerve repair and improve chronic
denervation [ 74,75].
Induced pluripotent stem cells Recently, the development of
induced pluripotent stem cell technology expands cell source
for cell therapies and largely pushes the progress of regener-
ative medicine [ 76,77]. Undifferentiated induced pluripotent
stem cells can differentiate to neural crest stem cells or even
Schwann cells with myelinating abilities [ 32,78]. The trans-
plantation of a bio-absorbable nerve conduit seeded withneurospheres derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to a
5 mm mice sciatic nerve gap significantly boosts the growth of
axons and the functional recovery of motor and sensory nervefunctions at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after surgery [ 79]. A long-
term follow-up study shows that induced pluripotent stem
cells enhance axonal regeneration and myelination withoutinducing teratomas at 24 and 48 weeks after surgery [ 80].
Induced pluripotent stem cell-based nerve conduits, when
combined with basic fibroblast growth factor, exhibit evenbetter regenerative effects [ 81]. Ouchi T et al. generated low-
affinity nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFR)- and thymo-
cyte antigen-1 (THY-1)-positive neural crest-like cells (LT-NCLCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells [ 82].
Kimura H et al. further investigated the biological effects of
these cells by filling cells into a silcone tube and transplant
the tube to bridge a 6 mm interstump gap in NOD-SCID
mice [ 83]. Neural crest-like cells promote axon elongation,
advance nerve remyelination and largely enhance motor func-
tion recovery, achieving a similar effect to that in the autograft
group [ 82,83]. However, it was reported by another study
that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived Schwann
cell precursors may not be able to form a myelin sheath,
although they possess similar engraftment and migrationcharacteristics as Schwann cells [ 84].
The downsides of induced pluripotent stem cells are
that they exhibit some similar characteristics to embryonicstem cells, including malignant potential [ 77,85]. Thegeneration technology of qualified induced pluripotent
stem cells lacks reliability as well [ 86]. These realistic
barriers limit the clinical application of induced pluripo-
tent stem cells in tissue-engineered nerve grafts as seedcells.
Challenges and perspectives
A growing literature base of pre-clinical trials of stem cell-based tissue-engineered nerve grafts illuminates the promisingfuture of the application of stem cells. The effectiveness of
stem cells in clinical trials is also satisfying, although the
number of reported clinical cases is not much. For instance,a 23-year-old female patient with median and ulnar nerve
injury received a transplantation of NeuraGen
®guides filled
with autologous skin-derived precursor cells. Examinationalresults from pinch gauge test, static two-point discrimination,
touch test with monofilaments, electrophysiological test and
MRI demonstrate that the biological functions of injuredmedian and ulnar nerves are recovered during a 3-year
follow-up period [ 87]. In another study, a total of 22 patients
with median or ulnar nerve injuries received application ofautologous bone marrow mononuclear cells into silicone
tubes. Compared with another 22 patients treated with
empty silicone tubes, patients treated with silicone tubes filled
with autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells have better
motor function, sensation and the effect of pain on functionat 1 year after surgery [ 88].
In spite of the excellent prospects, there still exists some
troubling details affecting the safety and efficiency of stemcell therapy. For cell-based therapies, applied cells should be
collected and cultured in advance, expanded to a large popu-
lation and cryopreserved prior to transplantation [ 10]. Many
attempts can be exploited to advance the clinical application
of stem cells. For instance, the tumorigenicity of stem cells
should be noted, although malignancy does not normallyoccur after stem cell administrations [ 10]. Cell banks can be
constructed and preserved to ensure the quantity and quality
of stem cells [ 35]. The mobilization, homing and migration,
as well as the delivery methods, of stem cells should be
further improved to increase the viability of applied stem cells
[17,89]. To maintain phenotypic stability, the heterogeneity
of many stem cells—for example, mesenchymal stem cells—
should also be taken into consideration since the in vitro
culture and expansion of cells may further exacerbate the
heterogeneity of stem cell populations.
On the other hand, it is worth noting that severe and
prolonged peripheral nerve injury often leads to muscle atro-
phy. Therefore, stem cells can be expanded from injecting
to the injured nerve sites to target muscles. For instance, ithas been demonstrated that the application of motor neurons
derived from murine embryonic stem cells to the gastrocne-
mius muscles after mice tibial nerve transection stimulatesmotor function recovery and ameliorates denervation atro-
phy [ 90]. Similarly, the injection of adipose stem cells into
the gastrocnemius muscle improves muscle atrophy and nervefunction [ 91].8 Burns & Trauma, 2020, Vol. 8, tkaa002
Conclusion
Over the last few years, the technology involved in the con-
struction of tissue-engineered nerve grafts has seen great
progress. The incorporation of stem cells, such as embryonicstem cells, neural stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem
cells, adipose stem cells, skin-derived precursor stem cells and
induced pluripotent stem cells has enhanced the therapeuticeffects of tissue-engineered nerve grafts. The extensive effec-
tiveness of stem cells enlightens the promising future of the
large-scale clinical use of stem cells.
