The white-rot fungi (WRF) group can seem con -
fusing to some researchers at first, as it is not a typical 
taxonomic group, comprising all the fungi belong -
ing to the same taxonomic ranks. True is it that most white-rotters come from the Basidiomycota division 
(kingdom: Fungi, subkingdom: Dikarya) and many can share similarities in morphology, genetics and biologi -
cal characteristics. Nevertheless, what makes a species a member of WRF is none of these, the species needs to be capable of synthesising ligninolytic enzymes (Young and Akhtar, 1998). The result of activity of these en -
zymes, namely lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxi -
dase and laccase, explains the name given to the group of fungi possessing the ability to produce them. The en -
zymes allow the white-rotters to decompose lignin con -
tent of any wooden material, leaving only the cellulose as a partly-digested wood component, which appears as typical white stains on the attacked wood, hence such a name was given (Kang et al., 2007). 
In nature WRF degrade wood components in vari -
ous mechanisms, depending on a species: some white-rotters inhabit only dead wooden material, some colo -
nize living plants eventually causing their death and some can do both (Sośnicka et al., 2018). Only white-White-rot fungi and their 
lignin modifying enzymes: an effective tool to fight 
recalcitrant organic 
pollutants

Summary:
In nature species belonging to the white-rot fungi group 
are responsible degradation of wood components, mainly 
lignin but also partly cellulose, due to the specific lignin-
modifying enzymes they synthesise. Nevertheless, these enzymes tend to act not only upon constituents of wood, 
but also other macromolecular compounds having within 
their structure the same bonds as the ones within a lignin and cellulose molecule. It has been reported that with the 
use of the mentioned enzymes it is possible to break down 
various recalcitrant organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, biphenyls or heavy met -
als. This bioremediation technique using fungi as a tool to remove such xenobiotics is called mycoremediation and shows more advantages when compared to bioremedia -
tion with the use of bacteria. 
Key words:  white-rot fungi, mycoremediation, xenobiotics, 
waste management, environment protectionrotters are known to effectively and completely degrade 
lignin to carbon dioxide and water, in this process they gain access to carbon and energy source (Kirk and Far -
rell, 1987). Lignin is a  complex heterogenous polymer that is made of three types of phenylpropane unit ( p-
coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alco -
hol) bonded to each another in many different ways (Du et al., 2013). As mentioned before, the degradation of lignin is an enzymatic process and it involves break -
ing down the C-C and C-O-C bonds within the lignin structure in a process of an oxidative degradation (Le -
onowicz et al., 1999). These bonds are present in many other organic molecules with a  branched structure, some of them are known as recalcitrant organic pollut -
ants, as they are resistant to most means of degradation and cause an environmental threat when they accumu -
late. The search for an effective way of dealing with toxic wastes and the discovery of potential that WRF possess became the origin of an idea to employ this fungi group into a remediation technique (Barrech et al., 2018).
Mycoremediation
The technique that is based on using microorgan -
isms to clean up the polluted site (soil, groundwater), eliminate or neutralise toxic contaminants and manag -
ing wastes is called bioremediation (Chatterjee et al., 2017). Mycoremediation is a type of bioremediation us -
ing fungi, including WRF, for that purpose and it refers to their possibilities as microorganisms of degrading a  great number of recalcitrant pollutants and trans -
forming industrial wastes into products (Kulshreshtha et al., 2014). Bacteria have also been used for the same purpose, nevertheless, mushrooms exhibit some valu -
able advantages over the ones that bacteria can offer. First of all, fungi do not require preconditioning to the DOI:  10.24131/3247.180301

exposed to it in order to induce enzymes that can later act upon the pollutant. Furthermore, pollutants need to reach a substantial concentration for the synthesis of enzymes to occur, below which the bacteria will be un -
able to act (Asamudo et al., 2006).
Recalcitrant xenobiotics
The constant need to develop new methods to deal 
with environmental pollution is followed by the lack 
of solutions to apply to the most resistant pollutants. Recently, the contamination with synthetic organic compounds has become a major issue worldwide. These materials, called xenobiotics, are not products created by nature, but by industry and due to this they cannot be easily be degraded by natural forces (Thakur, 2018). Environmental contamination has accelerated, which is due to industrial expansion, extensive chemical usage in agriculture, automobile exhaust, mine explorations, and the improper waste disposal practices of wastes contain -
ing high metal concentrations by industry, commercial establishments, and residential communities (Ali et al., 2017) (Fang et al., 2014). These chemicals include poly -
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pentachloro-phenols, polychlorinated biphenyls, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane, benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene xylene and trinitrotoluene (Lau et al., 2003) (Verdin et al., 2004). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are highly recalcitrant environmental contaminants, they are a by-product of the burning-off fossil fuels, coal mi -
ning, oil drilling and wood burning (Adenipekun and Lawal, 2012). Mushrooms seem to be ideal candidates to be used as a tool in degrading such materials as the results of many pieces of research have shown. To give examples, they are capable of accumulating heavy met -
als and biodegrading different lignocellulosic substrates (Bennet et al., 2002), they can be used in wastewater treatment (Xu et al., 2017), in degradation of broad-spectrum organochlorine pesticide lindane (Kaur et al., 2016), degradation of common endocrine disrupt -
ers (EDCs; bisphenol A, estrone, 17-β-estradiol, estriol, 17-α-ethinylestradiol, triclosan and 4-n-nonylphenol) (Křesinová et al., 2018), they also break down engine oil (Adenipekun and Isikhuemhen, 2008). The applications do not end here and many of them are still to be exam -
ined. 
Waste-management potential 
The variety of possibilities to employ fungi into bio -
remediation emerges from species diversity. They can 
effectively use different mechanisms of action to decon -
taminate polluted sites and stimulate the environment to fight against them (Kulshreshtha et al., 2014). Many papers report the role of mushrooms in bioremediation of pollutants in the process of biodegradation, biosorp -
tion and bioconversion (Wu et al., 2008) (Prigione et al., 2008) (Kamei et al., 2006). 
Bioconversion gives a possibility of using a variety of 
waste by-products generated by industries as media for fungi cultivation. Hence it is right to say that the prod -
uct of bioconversion is a fungus itself (Kulshreshtha et al., 2014). To show examples, the following species have been reported to use bioconversion: Pleurotus citrinopi -
leatus  to be capable of handmade paper and cardboard 
industrial waste bioconversion with no genotoxicity shown (Kulshreshtha et al., 2013), Pleurotus ostreatus  
to be able to bioconvert sawdust (Akinyele et al., 2012), Volvariella volvacea  using some agroindustrial residues 
such as cassava, sugar beet pulp, wheat bran and apple pomase in bioconversion process (Akinyele et al., 2011), Lentinula edodes capable of bioconverting eucalyptus wastes (Brienzo et al., 2007).
Biosorption was defined as “a non-directed physico-
chemical interaction that may occur between metal/ra -dio nuclide species and the cellular compounds of bio -
logical species” (Shumate and Strandberg, 1985). This process is based on the sorption of metallic ions/xeno -
biotics from effluent by live or dried biomass which can exhibit a  marked tolerance towards metals and other adverse conditions (Gavrilescu, 2004). The mechanism of uptaking xenobiotics consists of two processes, which are bioaccumulation and biosorption. Bioaccumulation refers to transport of a pollutant into to cell and parti -
tioning it into intracellularly located components, while biosorption means binding the pollutant to the biomass without requiring metabolic energy (Kulshreshtha et al., 2014). What is interesting, biosorption can be per -
formed not only by a  living organism but also a  dead one, and the last one tends to have more advantages. First of all, the dead fungi mass can be easily obtained from industries as it is considered to be waste, con -
trary to a  living fungus that has to be cultivated and maintained in optimal parameters. This is connected with the second reason explaining why dead biomass is easier to handle – it is not sensitive to any operating conditions like pH, temperature, nutrient supply etc. (Mar’in et al., 1997). The reported examples of fungi using biosorption to remove pollutants are: Lactaricus piperatus  and Agaricus bisporus  removing cadmium 
(II) ions (Nagy et al., 2014), Fomes fasciatus  removing 
copper (II) (Sutherland and Venkobachar, 2013), Pleuro -
tus platypus , Agaricus bisporus , Calocybe indica  remov -
ing copper, zinc, iron, cadmium, lead, nickle (Lamrood and Ralegankar, 2013), Pleurotus tuber-regium  remov -
ing heavy metals (Oyetayo et al., 2012).
Biodegradation is the most common and effective 
process of removing xenobiotics from the contaminat -
ed site. It is a process of complete mineralization of the substrate to simple compounds (CO
2, H2O, NO3) and 
other inorganic compounds by living organisms. Fungi White-rot fungi and their lignin modifying enzymes: an effective tool to fight recalcitrant organic pollutants  | Agata Sośnicka  | EDUKACJA BIOLOGICZNA I ŚRODOWISKOWA 3/2018

system that is thoroughly described in the next chapter. 
Ligninolytic complex
The main enzymes of a white-rotter that are capable 
of lignin mineralisation are called the lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs), the best characterized of which are: lignin peroxidase (LiP, EC 1.11.1.14), manganese peroxi -
dase (MnP, EC 1.11.1.13) (Orth and Tien, 1995) and lac -
case (Lac, EC 1.10.3.2) (Thurston, 1994). These enzymes are extracellular which means they are being secreted outside the fungus’ cell, so into the environment where they act. The decomposition process of lignin can be enhanced by WRF by producing several oxidoreduc -
tases: glyoxal oxidase (EC 1.2.3.5), aryl alcohol oxidase (veratryl alcohol oxidase; EC 1.1.3.7), pyranose 2-oxi -
dase (glucose 1-oxidase; EC 1.1.3.4), cellobiose/quinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.5.1), and cellobiose dehydroge -
nase (EC 1.1.99.18) (Ander and Marzullo, 1997). LME production takes place during secondary metabolism and is induced by limited nutrient levels, particularly nitrogen.
Peroxidases such as LiP, MnP are catalysers for the 
oxidation of various substrates in the presence of H
2O2 
as electron acceptor, as shown in the reaction below
2S + H2O + 2 e− → 2Sox + 2H2O
where: S, substrate (electron donor); Sox, oxidized 
substrate (Falade et al., 2016) including lignin peroxi -
dase, are topical owing to their high redox potential and prospective industrial applications. The prospec -
tive applications of lignin peroxidase span through sec -
tors such as biorefinery, textile, energy, bioremediation, cosmetology, and dermatology industries. The litany of potentials attributed to lignin peroxidase is occasioned by its versatility in the degradation of xenobiotics and compounds with both phenolic and non-phenolic con -
stituents. Over the years, ligninolytic enzymes have been studied however; research on lignin peroxidase seems to have been lagging when compared to other lig -
ninolytic enzymes which are extracellular in nature in -
cluding laccase and manganese peroxidase. This asser -
tion becomes more pronounced when the application of lignin peroxidase is put into perspective. Consequently, a  succinct documentation of the contemporary func -
tionalities of lignin peroxidase and, some prospective applications of futuristic relevance has been advanced in this review. Some articulated applications include delignification of feedstock for ethanol production, tex -
tile effluent treatment and dye decolourization, coal de -
polymerization, treatment of hyperpigmentation, and skin-lightening through melanin oxidation. Prospec -
tive application of lignin peroxidase in skin-lightening functions through novel mechanisms, hence, it holds high value for the cosmetics sector where it may serve as suitable alternative to hydroquinone; a potent skin-lightening agent whose safety has generated lots of con -
troversy and concern.
What is important, all LME enzymes are non-spe -
cific to the substrate, they can catalyse many different reactions, which means they can be used in the myco -
remediation process in order to degrade various macro -
molecular compounds. This a is highly particular phe -
nomenon as many xenobiotics have never before been encountered in nature and mainly WRF are the only organisms able to break them down (Pointing, 2001). Lignin-degrading enzymes has been applied to many different areas such as paper industry, textile industry, wastewater treatment and the degradation of herbicides (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2013). Lignin peroxidase (LiP)
LiP belongs to a class of haemoprotein peroxidases. 
The molecule has a globular shape, its molecular weight is in between 38 kDa and 43 kDa and has the isoelectric point in between 3.3 and 4.7 (Piontek et al., 1993) (Kirk et al., 1986) (Glumoff et al., 1990). LiP can oxidise both phenolic and non-phenolic substrates. It is involved in the formation of a radical cation through one electron oxidation which leads to side‐chain cleavage, demeth -
ylation, intramolecular addition and rearrangements (Falade et al., 2016). LiPs tend to have a stronger redox potential compared to other peroxidases, because their iron is more electron deficient (Millis et al., 1989), and this makes it possible for LiPs to oxidise moderately ac -
tivated aromatic rings, contrary to other peroxidases, which need a strongly activated aromatic ring in order to act upon it (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2013).
LiP has a common catalytic cycle, which starts with 
a  two-electron oxidation of the native ferric enzyme [LiP]-Fe(III) by H
2O2 to form a  two-electron oxidised 
form of [LiP]•+-Fe(IV) (compound I). Within the next 
reaction the oxidised form (compound I) first is be -
ing reduced by a reducing substrate and then receives an electron to form one-electron oxidised form (com -
pound II). In the last reaction the substrate loses an electron while being reduced, which is being received by the one-electron oxidised form (compound II). This returns the enzyme to the native state and the oxidation cycle is complete (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2013).
LiP has been described widely to be capable of de -
grading various types of recalcitrant aromatic com -
pounds including three‐ and four‐ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Wesenberg et al., 2003), poly -
chlorinated biphenyl (Pease and Tien, 1992), chlorophe -
nols and synthetic dyes (Chivukula et al., 1995), which show it can be successfully applied in remediation (Falade et al., 2016).White-rot fungi and their lignin modifying enzymes: an effective tool to fight recalcitrant organic pollutants  | Agata Sośnicka  | EDUKACJA BIOLOGICZNA I ŚRODOWISKOWA 3/2018

gillus niger, Phlebia radiata, Pleurotus ostreatus , Pleuro -
tus sajor-caju  (Falade et al., 2016)
Manganese peroxidase (MnP)
MnP is also a  haemoprotein of a  globular shape, 
its molecular weight is around 53 kDa and its isoelec -
tric point of about 3.7 (Shin et al., 2005). It oxidizes 
the one-electron donor Mn2+ to Mn3+ which then can 
oxidise a large number of phenolic substrates. The abil -
ity of MnP to oxidize Mn2+ is due to a Mn-binding site 
formed by three acidic residues near the internal heme propionate (Martínez, 2002). MnP is regarded as a first enzyme acting upon a  phenolic compounds due to Mn
3+oxidising different mono- and dimeric phenols. 
The catalytic cycle resembles the LiP. It is initiated by 
the binding reaction of H2O2 to the native ferric enzyme 
[MnP]-Fe(III). This occurs within subsequent cleavage of the peroxide O-O bond which needs a two-electron transfer from the heme and results in formation of the Fe
4+-oxo-porphyrin-radical complex- [MnP]•+-Fe(IV) 
(compound I). A  Mn2+ ion gives away one electron to 
the porphyrin intermediate to form [MnP]-Fe(IV) (compound II) and is oxidized to Mn
3+. The native en -
zyme is generated from compound II in a similar way in the process of the donation of one electron from Mn
2+ 
to form Mn3+. The reduction of compound proceeds in 
a similar way and another Mn3+ is formed from Mn2+, 
which leads to the emergence of the native enzyme and this completes the catalytic cycle (Wariishi et al., 1988).
The exceptional degradative potential of MnP ex -
ceeds lignin decomposition. MnP acts upon modified derivatives of lignin, having an effect on various or -
ganopollutants, to which we can classify polyclic aro -
matic hydrocarbons (PAH) (Bogan and Lamar, 1996), chlorophenols (Hofrichter et al., 1997), nitroaromatic compounds (Van Aken et al., 2000), arsenic-containing (Fritsche et al., 2000) agents and more.
Well known MnP-synthesising WRF species are, 
among others: Agaricus bisporus , Armillaria mellea , Irpex lacteus , Lentinula edodes , Phanerochaete chryso -
sporium , Phlebia radiata , Pleurotus ostreatus, Pleurotus 
sajor-caju , Trametes versicolor .
Laccase (Lac)
Laccase is a member of blue multi-copper oxidases 
superfamily which means it exhibits another mecha -
nism of action than previously described peroxidases (Morozova et al., 2007). In comparison with peroxidas -
es, oxidases do not use hydrogen peroxide and, due to this reason, they show a greater stability, which allows the use of them more efficiently (Su et al., 2018). Most of the laccases synthesised by WRF are extracellular proteins, nevertheless some intracellular ones have also been reported (Kirk et al., 1986). 
The majority of the fungal laccases are monomeric 
globular proteins, with molecular weight oscillating between 60-70 kDa, having an acidic isoelectric point around 4, moreover, all of them show a similar struc -
ture consisting of three sequentially arranged copper domains (Shleev et al., 2004). The enzyme consists of four metal ions classified into three types – T1, T2, and T3, among which T1 copper is responsible for the blue colour (Yaropolov et al., 1994). 
Laccases catalyse a one-electron oxidation with the 
concomitant four-electron reduction of molecular oxy -
gen to water, resulting in reductive cleavage of a dioxy -
gen bond (Giardina et al., 2009). Cu metal atoms of the enzyme structure play a key role in the reduction of O
2 
to H
2O. The Cu atoms of laccases include one copper 
of type 1 (Cu
1- T1), one of type 2 (Cu
2-T2) and two of 
type 3 (Cu
3-T3) (Su et al., 2018). Lac catalytic proper -
ties can be briefly described in the following three major steps: (1) T1 copper is reduced by accepting electrons from the reducing substrate; (2) Electrons are trans -
ferred from T1 copper to the tri-nuclear T2/T3 cluster; (3) Molecular oxygen is activated and reduced to wa -

overall outcome of the catalytic cycle is the reduction of one molecule of oxygen to two molecules of water and the concomitant oxidation of four substrate molecules to produce four radicals (Claus, 2004). The described di -
rect interaction of the substrate with the copper cluster shows the simplest case of laccase catalytic cycle. Of -
tentimes it occurs that a substrate cannot get oxidised directly by laccases, for which reasons can vary: a sub -
strate can have a too big molecule to penetrate into the enzyme active site or show a too high redox potential (Riva, 2006). Nevertheless, this limitation can be eas -
ily overcome with the presence of mediators- these are compounds acting as intermediate substrates for lac -
case. The use of certain low-weight compounds, act -
ing as redox mediators, widen the catalytic activity of laccase towards more recalcitrant compounds (Barreca et al., 2003). The most commonly used mediators in literature are 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 1-hydroxy- benzotriazole (HBT) (Hilgers et al., 2018).
Laccases exhibit a  broad substrate specificity, they 
can catalyse the oxidation of ortho- and para-diphe -
nols, aminophenols, polyphenols, polyamines, anilines and aromatic thiols, lignins and aryl diamine as well as some inorganic ions (Solomon et al., 1996).
Due to the wide variety of reactions catalysed by 
laccases, these enzymes hold a great promise for many potential applications.
Laccases are typical to be synthesised by many WRF 
species, but the ones of a greater importance are: Polypo -
rus versicolor , Neurospora crassa , Pleurotus ostreatus, 
Phlebia radiata , Trametes versicolor , Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium , Armillaria mellea (Solomon et al., 1996) 
(Abdel-Hamid et al., 2013) (Sośnicka et al., 2018).Conclusions
In the age of the high environmental pollution rates, 
where day by day the number of toxic pollutants accu -
mulate causing a  real health threat it seems urgent to look for different solutions that would deal with the wastes we are creating. In order not to turn the forces of nature against ourselves we should start cooperating with it, noticing the help nature itself offers. All the re -
search on the use of fungi for the environment treat -
ment that has been done shows endless applications of the mycoremediation technique. There is no doubt using organisms that are part of environment to fight artificial wastes created by people is an eco-friendly way to achieve the goal – it is a relatively easy process to conduct, it is cheap, safe, and what is more important, becoming more popular.References

skuteczne narzędzie do zwalczania opornych organicznych zanieczyszczeń
Agata Sośnicka
W naturze gatunki należące do grupy white-rot fungi  (pol. 
grzyby białej zgnilizny) są odpowiedzialne za rozkład lig -
niny oraz w  niewielkim stopniu celulozy – składników 
drewna, co jest możliwe dzięki kompleksowi enzyma -
tycznemu, który grzyby z tej grupy posiadają. Jednakże 
enzymy syntetyzowane przez te gatunki działają nie tylko 
na ligninę, ale także są w stanie rozłożyć inne wielkoczą -
steczkowe związki, które w  swojej strukturze zawierają 
te same wiązania chemiczne, co w  przypadku cząstecz -
ki ligniny. Literatura podaje, iż enzymy te powodują de -
gradację różnych trudno degradowanych organicznych zanieczyszczeń, takich jak wielopierścieniowe węglowo -
dory aromatyczne, fenole, polichlorowane bifenyle czy 
metale ciężkie. Technikę bioremediacji, w  której używa 
się grzyby jako narzędzie do walki z zanieczyszczeniami 
środowiska, nazwano mykoremediacją i  wykazuje ona więcej zalet w porównaniu do szeroko stosowanej biore -
mediacji z użyciem bakterii.
