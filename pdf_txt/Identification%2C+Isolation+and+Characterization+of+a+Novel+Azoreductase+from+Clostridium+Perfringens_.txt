Title of Study: A BIOCHEMICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL AND ST RUCTURAL 
CHARACTERIZATION OF AzoC, A NOVEL AZOREDUCTASE 
FROM CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS 
 
Major Field: MICROBIOLOGY, CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLO GY 
 
Abstract: Azo dyes are used throughout the paper, textile, fo od, beverage, pharmaceutical and 
cosmetic industries as artificial colorants and are  characterized by the presence of an azo (double 
nitrogen) bond. Azoreductases are bacterially-produ ced enzymes which are capable of breaking 
these azo bonds and, in some cases, can result in t he production of carcinogenic metabolites. 
Clostridium perfringens, a common inhabitant of both the human gut and the e nvironment,  is a 
bacteria that produces a significant amount of azor eductase activity. The gene that encodes for 
this azoreductase was characterized and given the n ame AzoC. AzoC is very novel, as compared 
to similarly functioning enzymes. AzoC has been sho wn to preferentially reduce large molecular 
weight sulfonated azo dyes, such as Direct Blue 15 (992.8 g/mol), with use of NADH and FAD as 
cofactors. The azoreduction is much increased under  anaerobic conditions as compared to aerobic 
conditions (4-fold greater activity under anaerobic  conditions). Interestingly, with certain azo dye 
and cofactor conditions, the presence of the cofact ors alone can cause azo dye reduction. 
However, with the use of an azoreductase-free contr ol in place, this can non-enzymatic activity 
can be accounted for. In addition, the structure of  AzoC was found to be trimeric in nature, with 
the AzoC monomers being held together by disulfide bonding. The secondary structure of AzoC 
is consistent with that of other azoreductases, des pite having low sequence identity. When the 
azoC gene was disrupted (knocked out) by intron insertio n, results suggested the presence of 
additional enzymes capable of azoreduction. In addi tion, azo dye metabolites produced following 
azo dye reduction were found to slow C. perfringens generation time. AzoC was found to be 
released following C. perfringens exposure to sulfonated azo dyes and negatively char ged 
sulfonated compounds. This enzyme was also found to  localize to the Gram-positive periplasmic 
region of the C. perfringens cells. The results of this study serve to fill an i mportant gap in the 
literature, providing the first information on a st rictly anaerobic azoreductase, as well as a link 
between environmental azo dye exposure and the phys iological state of Clostridium perfringens 
cells.

 CHAPTER I 
 
 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
Most of the organisms on Earth are microorganisms a nd they are invisible to the naked 
eye. Despite their small size, these microorganisms  play central roles in the web of life. Evidence 
has shown that the lives of all macro life forms (h umans, animals, plants) are intimately tied to 
the activities of these microorganisms (Madigan  et al , 2009). 
Microorganisms are very diverse in nature. Due to t heir overall diversity and adaptability, 
microorganisms can be found in a variety of locatio ns such hydrothermal vents deep in the ocean 
floor, the glaciers of the Arctic and on and within  other organisms, including humans, animals 
and plants. Microorganisms generally fall into one of three domains, Bacteria, Archaea or 
Eukarya. Though there are major differences between  the domains, members of Archaea are 
typically found in more extreme environments than B acteria and are often called "extremophiles", 
for their proclivity towards extreme environments ( Madigan  et al , 2009). Bacteria, though not as 
extreme, are found in a wide variety of environment s, from the soil to animal guts, and often live 
in complex communities with the other domains (Arch aea and Fungi). In these complex 
communities, microorganisms often link metabolic pr ocesses in a way such that the waste 
products of one species may be the nutrient or ener gy source for another species. 
Microorganisms have vast metabolic capacities in te rms of the way in which they acquire 
energy. They can use different electron sources for  energy, including organic compounds like 2 
 glucose (chemoorganotrophs), inorganic compounds li ke hydrogen (chemolithotrophs), and the sun 
(phototrophs). Microorganisms have different catabo lic systems such as aerobic respiration (oxygen 
as the terminal electron acceptor), anaerobic respi ration (inorganic compound other than oxygen as 
the terminal electron acceptor), and fermentation ( organic compounds), and in some cases, they can 
switch between the different systems based on the e nvironmental conditions. 
 Because of their vast metabolic capacities, microo rganisms play valuable roles in the 
environments that they reside in. Besides their rol e in nutrient cycling and the global biogeochemical  
cycle, microorganisms play a big role environmental ly in terms of bioremediation. In bioremediation, 
the unique metabolic capacities of certain species of microorganisms are used to clean up 
environmental pollution that is usually anthropogen ic and recalcitrant in the environment. These types  
of microorganisms are also commonly used to clean u p wastewater treatment plant effluent, which 
would otherwise typically require harsh chemicals t o treat.  
In addition to their use in bioremediation in the e nvironment, microorganisms have also been 
exploited for their metabolic capacities in other i ndustries. Fermenters, for example, have been 
exploited for years by the beverage industry and mo re recently the biofuel industry to produce 
alcohols. The nitrogen-fixating capacity of certain  environmental microorganisms has also been used 
by farmers for generations to improve crop yields. More recently, microorganisms have been used in 
biotechnology and genetic engineering to produce pr oducts of commercial interest and for gene 
expression and have revolutionized the way in which  molecular biology research is applied.  
General Human Microbial Flora 
 Before birth, humans are generally free of microor ganisms. However, during the birthing 
process, a baby is first exposed to the mother’s no rmal flora via mother’s birth canal. From birth to 
death, humans are exposed to microorganisms, which results in the human body having more bacteria 
cells on/in their bodies than human cells. As all b ody surfaces (skin and mucous membranes: mouth, 3 
 respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, urogenit al tract) become colonized by microorganisms, these  
bacteria can interact amongst themselves or with th e human host (Madigan  et al , 2009).  
Many microorganisms are only able to survive on the  human surface for a short period of 
time and are referred to as the transient microbial  flora, whereas those that have more of a permanent  
residence are known as the normal flora (Madigan  et al , 2009; Tortora  et al , 2012). The normal flora 
of an organism can be beneficial to the host and of ten do not cause problems unless they move from 
their normal habitat or can take advantage of a hos t's compromised immune system (Ahmad  et al , 
2010). Benefits of the normal flora that colonize t he human body include the prevention of the 
colonization of harmful microbes (pathogens) by way  of sequestering nutrients from these pathogens 
or by producing antimicrobial compounds which are h armful to the pathogens (Ahmad  et al , 2010). 
The normal flora can also aid in the digestion of f ood in the intestine and stimulate the immune 
system (Ahmad  et al , 2010).  
Normal Flora of the Human Gastrointestinal Tract 
 The gastrointestinal tract is home to the largest number of microorganisms in the human body 
as well as the most diversity overall with as many as 500 different species of bacteria (Finegold  et al , 
1975; Madigan  et al , 2009; Moore & Holdeman, 1974; Whitman  et al , 1998). Interestingly, 10 14  
colony forming units of bacteria is 10 times more t han the number of human cells in the body 
(Finegold  et al , 1975; Moore & Holdeman, 1974; Whitman  et al , 1998). The human gastrointestinal 
tract starts at the mouth, goes through the esophag us, into the stomach, followed by the small intesti ne 
and large intestine (Figure 1) (Madigan  et al , 2009). The environment of the gastrointestinal tr act 
changes dramatically from start to finish and each different environmental condition is able to suppor t 
different types of microorganisms (Madigan  et al , 2009). The role of the normal flora in the 
gastrointestinal tract is to aid in the digestion o f food, to enhance the body’s immune system, and to  
serve as an antagonist against pathogenic intestina l bacteria (Madigan  et al , 2009).  4 
  
Figure 1. General Anatomy of the Human Gastrointestinal Tract  and the Normal Flora (Madigan  et al , 2009). 
 
 Microbes enter the gastrointestinal tract through the food we eat, the water we drink, and the 
air we breathe. Saliva is one of the main sources o f bacteria entering the gastrointestinal tract; sal iva 
can contain millions of bacteria per milliliter (To rtora  et al , 2012). The first hurdle for 
microorganisms to entering our gastrointestinal tra ct is the low pH and overall harsh environment of 
the stomach (Madigan  et al , 2009). The low pH condition of the stomach can in activate some 
microorganisms, while others are able to survive ( Helicobacter , Lactobacilli and Streptococci ) and 
enter the intestines (Ahmad  et al , 2010; Borriello, 2000; Savage, 1977). Following t he stomach, the 
small intestine begins with the duodenum, which als o features a low pH, many of the same bacteria as 
found in the stomach, and other Gram-positive bacte ria (Arumugam  et al , 2011; Claesson  et al , 2009; 
Madigan  et al , 2009; Savage, 1977). In the jejunum and ileum, th ough, the pH is increased (4-5) and 
features as many as 10 5 to 10 7 colony forming units per gram of digested material  (Madigan  et al , 
5 
 2009). Here, the Gram-positive bacteria begin to be  outnumbered by Gram-negative bacteria and 
aerobic bacteria begin to be outnumbered by anaerob ic bacteria (Arumugam  et al , 2011; Borriello, 
2000; Claesson  et al , 2009; Madigan  et al , 2009). The large intestine is the most heavily po pulated 
region of the gastrointestinal tract by far, contai ning more than 100 billion bacteria per gram of fec al 
material (Borriello, 2000; Madigan  et al , 2009; Tortora  et al , 2012). Here we also find the most 
bacterial species diversity of all of the gastroint estinal tract, primarily due to the area being rich  in 
nutrients for the bacteria, having a relatively neu tral pH, and being more stagnant than the other are as 
of the gastrointestinal tract (Madigan  et al , 2009; Savage, 1977). Because of the low availabil ity of 
oxygen, we see microorganisms of varying degrees of  oxygen tolerance (Macfarlane & Gibson, 
1994). In the colon, Gram-negative bacteria (such a s Escherichia coli ) outnumber Gram-positive 
bacteria and microorganisms capable of anaerobic re spiration (such as Clostridium perfringens ) 
outnumber strictly aerobic microorganisms (Arumugam  et al , 2011; Borriello, 2000; Claesson  et al , 
2009; Madigan  et al , 2009).  
The diversity of the normal flora in the gastrointe stinal tract is constantly fluctuating and 
changing, based on diet and medications. People bei ng treated with antibiotics, for example, 
dramatically reduce the number of normal flora in t heir gastrointestinal tract which makes them more 
prone to infections by opportunistic pathogens (Mad igan  et al , 2009). Foods and supplements can 
provide a means of probiotics, which increases the colonization of lost normal gut flora thereby 
providing a health benefit (Madigan  et al , 2009). Probiotics can also provide a means to inc rease 
bacterial diversity of the normal gut flora, as pro biotic products such as yogurts and milk contain 
many different species of Lactobacillus , Lactococcus , Steptococcus and Bifidobacterium (Gueimonde  
et al , 2004).

 Metabolism of the Normal Intestinal Flora 
 The relationship between the human gastrointestinal  tract and the normal microbial flora that 
inhabit it is more than just a commensal relationsh ip; rather, the relationship is mutualistic. In the  
colon, the microbes benefit from human host as the intake and digestion of food fuels their 
metabolism and survival and in turn microbes metabo lize and produce vitamins which are necessary 
for human survival (Madigan  et al , 2009). For example, vitamins B 12  and K are considered essential 
because they cannot be synthesized by humans (Madig an  et al , 2009). Additionally, there are steroids 
produced by our liver and released into our intesti ne which are not absorbed by our bodies until they 
are modified and activated by the normal intestinal  flora (Gill  et al , 2006; Guarner & Malagelada, 
2003). Because of the overall diversity of microorg anisms within our gastrointestinal tract, there is a 
great diversity of metabolic capabilities of the ba cteria residing in our gut (Roberfroid  et al , 1995).  
Role of Intestinal Flora in Xenobiotic Metabolism a nd Carcinogenesis 
 Intestinal microflora play a key role in xenobioti c metabolism through a process called 
enterohepatic circulation (Hanninen  et al , 1987). The normal gut flora has a wide variety of  metabolic 
capabilities, as they can utilize enzymes to either  directly reduce xenobiotic compounds or to reduce 
the transformed metabolites produced by cytochrome P450 (Figures 2 and 3) (Chung, 1997). In some 
cases, these microbial enzymes can detoxify toxic c ompounds (in a way similar to cytochrome P450); 
however, in other cases, these microbial enzymes ca n produce compounds more toxic than the 
original compound through deconjugation reactions ( Figure 3) (Chung, 1997).  
 
Figure 2. Cytochrome P450 Reaction Scheme (Gandolfi, 1991; Iw asaki  et al , 2010; Roland  et al , 1993).

Figure 3. Generalized Drug Metabolism Scheme. 
 
Xenobiotics are molecules which are foreign to the host and are often encountered by the 
gastrointestinal tract as anthropogenic components of foods or beverages consumed (Chung, 1997). 
Since xenobiotics are foreign to the host, these ch emicals and often their metabolites are sometimes 
toxic and/or mutagenic in nature to the host. Enzym es of the host gastrointestinal tract, as well as 
those produced by the normal gut flora, can be both  beneficial and deleterious when it comes to 
dealing with these anthropogenic compounds (Chung, 1997).  
Regarding enterohepatic cycling, cytochromes such a s P450 are part of a supergene family 
that plays a major role through the oxidative metab olism of xenobiotics and other drugs and their 
clearance from the body (Iwasaki  et al , 2010). This supergene family is composed of mono-
oxygenases which are of mixed function and are pres ent in many tissues (Iwasaki  et al , 2010). The 
8 
 cytochromes in the liver, specifically cytochrome P 450, are the most involved in the metabolism and 
detoxification of xenobiotic compounds through Phas e I and Phase II reactions (Figure 3) (Chung, 
1997; Iwasaki  et al , 2010). In the liver, cytochrome P450 utilizes two  protons and two electrons from 
NADPH to oxidize the xenobiotic compound (Figure 2)  and a second enzyme, flavin monooxygenase 
modifies the xenobiotic to expose functional groups  for modification and conjugation (Figure 3) 
(Gandolfi, 1991; Hanninen  et al , 1987; Roland  et al , 1993). What prevents the removal of the 
modified molecule is the deconjugation process, nor mally driven by the flora in the intestines (Figure  
3). The deconjugated molecule can be toxic and reab sorb or recirculate, and is called enterohepatic 
cycling (Figure 3). This recirculation can occur se veral times, which can cause increasing levels of 
toxicity or detoxification in the body.   
Azo Dyes and Metabolism 
Humans have been using natural dyes for centuries. However, in 1856, William Henry Perkin 
accidently laid the groundwork for synthetic dyes ( Saratale  et al , 2010). Though W.H. Perkin did not 
directly develop azo dyes, his work with synthetic organic pigments laid the foundation for a 
synthetic compound that we use to this day (Saratal e  et al , 2010). Azo dyes are organic synthetic 
colorants which are used widely by the textile, pap er, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industries 
and are the most important dye currently used in th e textile industry (Chen, 2006; Chung  et al , 1992). 
Azo dyes are characterized by the presence of one o r more double nitrogen bonds (-N=N-, azo bond) 
and aromatic rings, as shown in Figure 4 (Pandey  et al , 2007). The presence of the chromophore, the 
azo bond, is what allows azo dyes to absorb light i n the visible spectrum and gives the dyes their 
color (Saratale  et al , 2010). Azo dyes are classified based on the prese nce of various functional 
groups, as well as the number of azo bonds present in the molecule.   9 
  
Figure 4.  Azo Dye Structures and Molecular Weights. 
 
Azo dyes are recalcitrant in the environment becaus e of the lack of similar natural 
compounds. Interestingly, only one natural compound  containing an azo group is known, 4,4'-
dihydroyazobenzene, from the Agaricus xanthodermus  mushroom (Gill & Strauch, 1984). It was 
recently estimated that yearly world dye production  was around 1 million tons, about half of this 
being contributed to azo dyes (Pandey  et al , 2007). Because of azo dye loss through rather ine fficient 
dyeing processes, azo dyes often enter the environm ent through wastewater streams, as wastewater 
treatment plants are generally not efficient at rem oving azo dyes from wastewater (Pandey  et al , 
2007). It is estimated that as much as 280,000 tons  of azo dyes are discharged into wastewater 
treatment plants every year (Saratale  et al , 2010).  
10 
 For years, wastewater treatment plant workers had i ssues with the removal of azo dyes from 
their wastewater streams (Saratale  et al , 2010). Using the physicochemical methods that are  
characteristic of wastewater treatment streams, azo  dyes are not completely removed and generate a 
multitude of secondary waste products themselves th at have their own pollution issues (Saratale  et al , 
2010). This process, in some cases, can produce sec ondary waste products that are more harmful than 
the original presence of the azo dyes in the wastew ater (Saratale  et al , 2010). When it was found that 
microorganisms were capable of reducing these dyes,  a bioremediation approach was sought in order 
to provide the most eco-friendly option for the rem oval of azo dyes from textile wastewater treatment 
streams (Saratale  et al , 2010).  
Many types of both microorganisms and macroorganism s are capable of metabolizing azo 
dyes. In fact, fungi, yeast, algae, plants, bacteri a and humans are all capable of breaking down these  
dyes (Saratale  et al , 2010). In bacteria, this metabolic process featur es the reductive cleavage of the 
azo bond of the dye, which in turn releases the aro matic amines which were used to form the azo dye 
(Figure 5) (Chen, 2006; Saratale  et al , 2010). In mammals, the breakdown of azo dyes is c atalyzed by 
liver enzymes, such as cytochrome P450, as previous ly mentioned for other xenobiotic compounds 
(Chung  et al , 2000; Rafii & Cerniglia, 1995).

 The ability of an azo dye to be reduced ultimately depends on the structure of the azo dye. 
The number of azo bonds and size of the dye play a major role in determining whether an azo dye 
will be metabolized, however, the primary factor in  azo dye reduction is in the characteristics of the  
functional groups surrounding the azo bond (Bardi &  Marzona, 2010; Chen, 2006). Specifically, the 
electron density surrounding the azo bond (Bardi & Marzona, 2010; Chen, 2006). The reduction of 
the azo bond has been shown to be facilitated by th e presence of electron-withdrawing groups 
surrounding the azo bond, such as -NO 2 and –SO 3H (Bardi & Marzona, 2010; Chen, 2006). Having 
such a functional group in the para position to the  azo bond reduces the electron density around the 
azo bond making it easier to be reduced (Figure 6) (Bardi & Marzona, 2010; Chen, 2006; Hsueh & 
Chen, 2008). In addition, steric hindrance and shee r size of functional groups in the ortho position c an 
decrease dye reduction (Figure 6) (Hsueh & Chen, 20 08).

 Azoreductase activity of bacteria in the human gast rointestinal tract was greatly advanced by 
accomplishments made by researchers at the National  Center for Toxicological Research (Rafii  et al , 
1990). These researchers created a large-scale semi -continuous culture system containing human 
intestinal microflora and exposed them to the azo d ye Direct Blue 15 (Rafii  et al , 1990). Through this 
system, these researchers were able to isolate inte stinal bacteria which were capable of reducing the 
azo dye and, in the process, greatly advance our kn owledge of the bacteria that produce this enzyme 
(Chung  et al , 1992; Rafii  et al , 1990). 
Mutagenicity of Azo Dyes and Aromatic Amines 
It is well-known that aromatic amines are notorious  for being carcinogenic in nature, 
especially those containing moieties of toluene, an iline, naphthalene and benzidine (Chung, 1997; 
Vineis & Pirastu, 1997). In fact, there are many st udies which show an increased prevalence for 
bladder cancer in individuals who have worked in or  near an azo dye manufacturing facility 
(Bulbulyan  et al , 1995; Cartwright, 1983; Chung, 1997; Chung  et al , 2000; Dillon  et al , 1994; Sontag, 
1981; Vineis & Pirastu, 1997). Specifically, the ar omatic amines accumulate in the bladders of these 
individuals as they are awaiting clearance from the  body and host cell mutagenesis occurs (Bulbulyan  
et al , 1995; Chung  et al , 2000; Vineis & Pirastu, 1997). Aside from bladder  cancer, the azo dye 
metabolites have also been linked to causing contac t dermatitis (when in contact with azo textile 
dyes), liver nodules, splenic carcinomas as well as  stomach, kidney and skin cancer (Brown & 
Devito, 1993; Dillon  et al , 1994; Sontag, 1981). To cause such toxicity and c ancer, it is thought that, 
like its parent azoreductase, the aromatic amines u ndergo metabolic activation to become highly 
reactive ions (Brown & Devito, 1993). These highly reactive ions, being very electrophilic, can bind 
to both DNA and RNA, causing tumors induced by gene tic mutation (Brown & Devito, 1993). The 
ability of azo dyes and their metabolites to persis t in the environment, coupled with their inherent 
toxicity and carcinogenicity, makes these compounds  a concern to both human health and 
environmental health. 13 
 The reduction of azo dyes by normal gastrointestina l tract flora has been well-studied in 
many bacteria in both whole cell culture studies ( Enterobacter aerogenes , Bacteroides , Clostridium , 
Fusobacterium , Ruminococcus , Salmonella , Staphylococcus , Streptococcus , Proteus , Lactobacillus 
and Eubacillus ) and in pure enzyme studies (direct purification o r heterologously expressed from 
bacteria such as E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, E nterococcus faecalis and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) (Chen  et al , 2004; Chung  et al , 1992; Macwana  et al , 2010; Nakanishi  et 
al , 2001; Punj & John, 2009; Sugiura  et al , 2006; Wang  et al , 2007). As azo dyes are used widely as 
artificial colorants in our food, beverage and phar maceutical products, the normal flora of the human 
gastrointestinal tract encounter these dyes very of ten (Goldin, 1990). Because the normal flora of the  
gastrointestinal tract are able to reduce these azo  dyes to aromatic amines, it is no surprise that th e 
ingestion of these dyes has been linked to several types of cancer in humans (Bulbulyan  et al , 1995; 
Cartwright, 1983; Chung, 1997; Chung  et al , 2000; Chung  et al , 1992; Dillon  et al , 1994; Sontag, 
1981; Vineis & Pirastu, 1997).  
Azoreductase 
The first recorded azoreductase discovery from a pu re culture was in 1982 by Zimmerman in 
Pseudomonas KF46 (now known as Xenophilus azovorans ) (Zimmermann  et al , 1982). This 
particular enzyme was found to be capable of reduci ng the azo dye, Orange II, by use of NADH or 
NADPH as electron donors and was monomeric in natur e (30 kDa) (Zimmermann  et al , 1982). Two 
years later, Zimmerman discovered another azoreduct ase in Pseudomonas  K24 (now known as 
Pigmentiphaga kullae ) capable of reducing Orange I (Zimmermann  et al , 1984). This additional 
azoreductase was also monomeric in structure, thoug h much smaller than the Orange II azoreductase 
(21 kDa versus 30 kDa) (Zimmermann  et al , 1984; Zimmermann  et al , 1982). Neither azoreductase 
showed any antigenic cross-reactivity, suggesting t hat they have very different protein sequences 
(Zimmermann  et al , 1984). Both of these azoreductases were shown to be flavin-independent, as in 14 
 no exogenous flavin was required for azoreduction t o occur (Zimmermann  et al , 1984; Zimmermann  
et al , 1982).  
The first record of flavin-dependent azoreductases being studied was in 1992 by Ghosh 
(Ghosh  et al , 1992). Ghosh studied the azoreductases of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Ghosh  et al , 
1992). Two azoreductases were identified in this ba cterium and they were very different in nature. 
Azoreductase I was a dimer (28kDa) whereas Azoreduc tase II was a monomer (11kDa) (Ghosh  et al , 
1992). Additionally, the azoreductases showed diffe rential dye specificity, as Azoreductase I was able  
to reduce the azo dye Amaranth, but Azoreductase II  was not (Ghosh  et al , 1992). Azoreductase II, 
however, could reduce Ponceau SX, Tartrazine and Or ange II (Ghosh  et al , 1992). Ghosh also 
identified azoreductase proteins in E. coli K12 which also had differential substrate specifici ties from 
the Shigella  azoreductases (Ghosh  et al , 1993; Ghosh  et al , 1992).  
In 2001, the first heterologous expression of an az oreductase occurred with the azoreductase 
that was discovered in Bacillus OY1-2, a soil bacterium (Suzuki  et al , 2001). This represented a huge 
step forward in the field as pure azoreductases wer e now able to be efficiently purified and tested. 
The pure azoreductase was shown to have broad dye s pecificity and to utilize NADPH as an electron 
donor without the addition of exogenous flavin (Suz uki  et al , 2001). Several years later, an 
azoreductase isolated from Rhodobacter sphaeroides  was shown to have a Ping-Pong Bi-Bi reaction 
mechanism (Bin  et al , 2004). In the Ping-Pong Bi-Bi mechanism, 2 moles of NADH are used to 
reduce 1 mole of azo dye via a flavin cofactor (Bin  et al , 2004). 
The breakthrough in the field of intestinal azoredu ctase research came in 2001 when 
Nakanishi's group was studying an enzyme that they had predicted to be an acyl carrier protein (acp) 
phosphodiesterase from E. coli  (Nakanishi  et al , 2001). This enzyme, though, was shown not to have  
any phosphodiesterase activity, but rather had high  azoreductase activity (Nakanishi  et al , 2001). 
Similarly, an acp phosphodiesterase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to have azoreductase 15 
 activity but not phosphodiesterase activity (Wang  et al , 2007). Both purified azoreductase enzymes 
required the addition of exogenous flavin cofactor (FMN) for azoreductase activity to occur 
(Nakanishi  et al , 2001; Wang  et al , 2007). The requirement for the exogenous addition  of flavin 
cofactor is azoreductase-dependent and may not be r equired by all azoreductases, as witnessed by the 
Bacillus azoreductase detailed above. Additionally, all azor eductases have been shown to utilize a 
nicotinamide cofactor for enzyme activity, though i t may be NADH or NADPH or either depending 
on the azoreductase. Again, the azoreductase reacti on in Pseudomonas  was shown to function by a 
Ping-Pong bi-bi reaction (Nakanishi  et al , 2001).  
Diversity of Azoreductases 
  All aerobic azoreductases which have been biochem ically studied in their pure forms to date 
are shown in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 t hat there is great diversity amongst biochemically-
tested azoreductases in terms of substrate specific ity, multimeric state and cofactors utilized. 
However, it is important to note that all but one o f the azoreductases in Table 1 are from aerobic or 
facultative anaerobes. Only one azoreductase from a  strictly anaerobic bacteria is well-characterized 
(Table 1).

 Azoreductase activity has been shown to occur nonen zymatically under anaerobic conditions 
(Stolz, 2001). Stolz describes a process that is de pendent on reduced flavins, many of which he states  
will react directly with either oxygen or the azo d yes themselves (Stolz, 2001). Previous studies have  
shown that under anaerobic conditions, the reduced flavins can shuttle electrons to the azo dye and 
cause non-enzymatic reduction of the azo bond (Roxo n  et al , 1967; Russ  et al , 2000; Stolz, 2001). 
However, reduced flavins are only prevalent in the cytoplasm of the cell, so the azoreduction must 
occur intracellularly in order for this process to occur (Stolz, 2001). With the highly polar nature o f 
some of the most frequently tested azo dyes, it see ms that transport of the azo dyes into the cytoplas m 
would be a major rate limiting factor (Stolz, 2001) . However, one could search the available genomes 
of anaerobic microorganisms to find that they do in  fact contain putative azoreductases. A common 
strategy is to use the gene sequence of the E. coli  azoreductase (AzoR) as a query to perform a 
BLAST search to find azoreductase genes. In additio n, the original acp phosphodiesterase primers 
have been used to search genomes for other potentia l azoreductases. 
Since the gene that encodes for an azoreductase was  isolated and characterized from 
Clostridium perfringens , an observation regarding whether anaerobic bacter ia contain unique 
azoreductases compared to aerobic bacteria can be m ade. It can be noted from the phylogenetic tree 
shown in Figure 7 that the sequence for the azoredu ctase of C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 is very 
different from the other azoreductases that have be en studied in pure form. As detailed in Table 1, no  
other azoreductases from strict anaerobes have been  studied, suggesting a possible explanation for the  
differences seen. When comparing similarity of AzoC  to the two azoreductases that it falls nearest to 
on the tree, Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 25923 and Staphylococcus cohnii , it can be 
determined that AzoC has only 19.4% identity with Staphylococcus cohnii   and only 17.5% identity 
with Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 25923 (determined with Mega5 and 
http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/ident_sim.html) (Tamura  et al , 2011). 20 
  
Figure 7.  Molecular  Phylogenetic Analysis of Azoreductases by the Maxim um Likelihood Method. The 
evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maxi mum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based  
model (Jones  et al , 1992). The tree with the highest log likelihood ( -6205.9679) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the 
heuristic search were obtained automatically as fol lows. When the number of common sites was < 100 or less 
than one fourth of the total number of sites, the m aximum parsimony method was used; otherwise BIONJ 
method with MCL distance matrix was used. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the 
number of substitutions per site. The analysis invo lved 28 amino acid sequences. All positions contain ing gaps 
and missing data were eliminated. There were a tota l of 141 positions in the final dataset. Evolutiona ry analyses 
were conducted in MEGA5 (Tamura  et al , 2011).

 In 1990, Fatemeh Rafii and colleagues showed that s everal strict anaerobic bacteria 
(Eubacterium hadrum, Eubacterium spp., Clostridium c lostridiiforme, Butyrivibrio spp., Bacteriodes 
spp., Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium nexil e and Clostridium spp. ) were capable of reducing 
azo dyes in culture studies (Rafii  et al , 1990). Two years later, Dr. Rafii determined that  the 
azoreductases from these various strictly anaerobic  bacteria had immunological homology, suggesting 
that they share common regions within their sequenc e (Rafii  et al , 1992). As more azoreductase genes 
are identified from anaerobic bacteria, the data in  Table 1 will include more anaerobic azoreductases,  
thereby, supporting the idea that both aerobic and anaerobic azoreductase do exist. 
Crystal Structures of Azoreductases  
 To date, only five azoreductases from aerobic and facultative anaerobes have been 
crystallized and their three-dimensional structures  determined, as detailed in Table 2. To date, no pu re 
azoreductases from strictly anaerobic bacteria have  had their structures determined. The first 
azoreductase structure was AzoR of E. coli , which was crystallized and its structure solved i n 2006 
(PBD 2D5I) (Ito  et al , 2006). The crystal structure of AzoR revealed the  active site of the protein in 
complex with Methyl Red, its preferred azo dye subs trate (Ito  et al , 2008). The three-dimensional 
structure of AzoR also shows that the protein has a  Rossmann fold structure with five parallel β-
sheets flanked by six α-helices (Ito  et al , 2006). AzoR is also homodimeric in nature, with e ach 
monomer having a flavodoxin-like fold holding FMN a t the dimer interface (Ito  et al , 2006). Site-
directed mutagenesis studies have suggested that co nformational active site changes are responsible 
for differential substrate specificity (Ito  et al , 2008).

 After AzoR was crystallized, the azoreductases from  E. faecalis (AzoA, PBD 2HPV) and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (paAzoR1, PBD 2V9C)  had their crystal structures solved in 2007 (Liu  et 
al , 2007; Wang  et al , 2007). These three-dimensional structures were ve ry similar to that of AzoR, 
showing a Rossmann fold structure and bound FMN cof actor in a flavodoxin fold (Liu  et al , 2007; 
Wang  et al , 2007). Both AzoA and paAzoR1 are homomultimers, t hough AzoA is a homodimer and 
paAzoR1 is a homotetramer (Liu  et al , 2007; Wang  et al , 2007). The azoreductases of Bacillus 
anthacis (PDB 3P09)  and Yersinia pestis (PDB 4ESE) have also been solved, but not intensive ly 
studied as they were both the result of high-throug hput Structural Genomics projects (Filippova  et al , 
2010; Tan  et al , 2012). However, both show the characteristic Ross mann fold; additionally, the 
azoreductase from Yersinia pestis was shown to be homodimeric in nature and in comple x with FMN 
in a flavodoxin fold (Filippova  et al , 2010; Tan  et al , 2012).  
The study of C. perfringens and its azoreductase activity is at its infancy. Th e role of 
azoreductase in C. perfringens is unknown, as its impact on the host or its surrou nding normal flora 
population is not fully understood. In addition, th e structure and function of the current AzoC is not  
fully known. Improving our understanding of these u nknowns will have implications in human health 
as well as in the environment. 
Clostridium perfringens 
Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens ) is a large, Gram-positive bacillus (Ahmad  et al , 
2010). C. perfringens is a strict anaerobe and forms endospores under poo r environmental conditions 
(Ahmad  et al , 2010). C. perfringens is ubiquitous and found everywhere from the soil to  the colon of 
the gastrointestinal tract of humans (Ahmad  et al , 2010). C. perfringens is a part of the normal flora 
of the gastrointestinal tract, though it can be an opportunistic pathogen if the conditions are 
appropriate, as the bacteria produces three types o f toxins (α-toxin, β-toxin and an enterotoxin) 
(Ahmad  et al , 2010). C. perfringens  can be a contaminant in food products and can caus e enterocolitis 23 
 and food poisoning when ingested in large quantitie s (Ahmad  et al , 2010). Most often, C. perfringens 
is found as a contaminant in meat, specifically bee f, food products (Angelotti  et al , 1962; Hall & 
Angelotti, 1965). C. perfringens is capable of sugar, starch, pectin and cellulose f ermentation, 
producing large quantities of hydrogen and carbon d ioxide gas and is a common cause of both gas 
gangrene and cellulitis (Ahmad  et al , 2010; Madigan  et al , 2009). The α-toxin and β-toxin produced 
by this medically-important bacterium are hemolytic  in nature and cause acute infections that have 
lytic effects on many types of cells (Ahmad  et al , 2010). C. perfringens  has a diverse metabolic 
capacity, as it is able to undergo both anaerobic r espiration and fermentation (Ahmad  et al , 2010). 
Some strains of C. perfringens  contain catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismut ase, but still require 
the environment to have low oxygen tension and a lo w oxidation-reduction potential (Gregory  et al , 
1978).  
Clostridium perfringens strains are grouped into five different types, base d on their 
production of the four toxins of C. perfringens , including α-toxin, β-toxin, γ-toxin and ι-toxin 
(Shimizu  et al , 2002a). The complete genome of C. perfringens strain 13, which produces α-toxin 
(Type A strain) and is isolated from the soil, is k nown (Shimizu  et al , 2002a). The complete genome 
of C. perfringens strain SM101 is also known, which is an enterotoxin -producing food poisoning 
isolate (Myers  et al , 2006). C. perfringens strain ATCC 13124 also has its complete genome know n 
(Myers  et al , 2006). In contrast, C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626, an intestinal isolate from a lamb , 
produces β-toxin (Type B strain). The genome sequen cing of C. perfringens ATCC 3626 is not yet 
complete. Investigation of the available genome of C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 shows that this 
particular strain is significantly different than t he other genome-sequenced C. perfringens  strains, 
including the well-studied C. perfringens strain 13, strain SM101 and strain ATCC 13124. As 
calculated by the National Center for Biotechnology  Information (NCBI), the dendrogram featuring 
all genome-sequenced C. perfringens strains shows that C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 is located 
on a separate clade from the three other genome-seq uenced C. perfringens strains, suggesting that the 24 
 not-often-studied C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 is quite unique. Additionally, C. perfringens 
strain ATCC 3626 has a much larger genome size (3.8 0 Mb) compared to C. perfringens strain 13 
(3.0 Mb), C. perfringens strain SM101 (2.96 Mb) and C. perfringens strain ATCC 13124 (3.26 Mb). 
C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 also has many more genes (3710) th an C. perfringens strain 13 
(2840), C. perfringens strain SM101 (2765) and C. perfringens strain ATCC 13124 (3016). C. 
perfringens strain ATCC 3626 also has many more proteins (3301)  than C. perfringens strain 13 
(2723), C. perfringens strain SM101 (2619) and C. perfringens strain ATCC 13124 (2876). 
Additionally, the numbers for C. perfringens will only rise, as its genome sequencing is not yet  
complete. 
Clostridium perfringens Cell Structure 
C. perfringens stains purple during a Gram stain and is thus a Gra m-positive bacteria. A 
schematic of the cell envelope structure is shown i n Figure 8. The cell structure of C. perfringens  is 
comprised of a cell membrane, which encompasses the  cytoplasm. Extracellular to the cell membrane 
of a Gram-positive bacteria lies the periplasmic sp ace (Forster & Marquis, 2012). The periplasmic 
space consists of proteins and lipoteichoic acid th at is anchored to the cell membrane (Forster & 
Marquis, 2012; Matias & Beveridge, 2008). Though th is area between the cell membrane and cell 
wall is often referred to as a periplasmic space, i t is technically an inner-wall zone (it is 30 nm th ick) 
and is not as thick as a typical Gram-negative cell  wall periplasmic space (Forster & Marquis, 2012).  
The Gram-positive bacterial cell wall is a very dyn amic structure that undergoes constant 
remodeling (Forster & Marquis, 2012; Xia  et al , 2010). This region is 25-50 nm thick and is 
composed of peptidoglycan, wall teichoic acid polym ers and a variety of amino acids; additionally, 
the peptidoglycan in Gram-positive bacteria is comp osed of disaccharide glycan chains of various 
lengths that are linked by short proteins (Forster & Marquis, 2012). It has been suggested that 
proteins as large as 25 kDa can freely cross the ce ll wall to the extracellular environment, but this 25 
  
Figure 8.  Cell Envelope Structure of a Gram-positive Bacteri a, Similar to C. perfringens . LTA (Lipotechoic 
acid) (Schneewind & Missiakas, 2012). 
 
 
estimate largely depends on the length of the glyca n chains of peptidoglycan, the level of cross-
linking between these chains, pH and turgor pressur e; it is by no means an unregulated event (Forster 
& Marquis, 2012). 
The cell wall of C. perfringens  (formerly C. welchii ) was studied in 1966 by B. T. Pickering 
(Pickering, 1966). In particular, the cell wall was  found to contain alanine, 2,6-diaminopimelic acid,  
glutamic acid, glycine, glucosamine, muramic acid, galactosamine, mannosamine, ethanolamine, 
rhamnose, galactose and phosphorus (Pickering, 1966 ). The structure of the cell wall was found to 
consist of 1 - 4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) a nd N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) residues 
(Pickering, 1966). To the NAM and NAG, through the carboxyl group of muramic acid, a peptide 
composed of D- and L-alanine, D-glutamic acid, L-ly sine and glycine is linked (Pickering, 1966). L-
lysine can also be found to be substituted by 2,6-d iaminopimelic acid (Pickering, 1966). In the cell 
wall model provided by B.T. Pickering, the hexapept ide crossbridge is predicted to be in the 
26 
 following order: L-Ala-D-Glu(Gly)-L-Lys(DAP)-D-Ala- D-Ala-D-Glu (Pickering, 1966). The 
peptidoglycan structure of Clostridium is known to be substantially different between vege tative and 
spore-forming cells, suggesting that this bacterium  enters a structurally-unique “non-growth” state 
(Humann & Lenz, 2009). 
In addition to the major cell wall components descr ibed above, C. perfringens also contains 
many important surface and cell wall proteins, as s tudied recently in C. perfringens strain ATCC 
13124 (Alam  et al , 2009). Many of the proteins found on the surface of this strain of C. perfringens 
were found to be immunogenic and are potential vacc ine candidates for this medically-important 
bacterium (Alam  et al , 2009). In addition, these S-layer proteins could also serve as a mechanism of 
rapid diagnosis of C. perfringens infections (Alam  et al , 2009; Sara & Sleytr, 2000). Proteins located 
on the surface of C. perfringens strain ATCC 13124 include ornithine carbamoyltransf erase, 
cystathione beta-lyase, choloylglycine hydrolase, s erine proteinase and rhomboid-family proteins, 
including many other proteins predicted to have fun ctions in metabolism (including amino acid 
transport and metabolism or lipid metabolism) (Alam  et al , 2009). In C. difficile , the secA2 gene is 
required for the assembly of the S-layer (Schneewin d & Missiakas, 2012).  C. perfringens is also 
known to have a functional two-component system (Bc eRS) that functions in signal transduction in 
response to stressors (Jordan  et al , 2008). 
Protein Translocation Systems 
The cell membrane is the main hurdle of proteins cr ossing to the extracellular environment. 
Six protein translocation systems have been studied  in Gram-positive bacteria to date (the Secretion 
translocation system, the twin arginine transporter , the fimbrillin-protein exporter, the flagella exp ort 
apparatus, phage-inserted holins and the ESAT-6.WXG 100 secretion system) (Forster & Marquis, 
2012). The protein translocation systems of C. perfringens have not been studied, though in close 
relatives C. tetani, C. difficile and C. acetobutylicum , the secretion translocation (Sec) system seems 27 
 to be the most common way that proteins are excrete d into the extracellular environment (Berks  et al , 
2005; Bruggemann  et al , 2003; Desvaux  et al , 2005; Schneewind & Missiakas, 2012). In C. difficile , 
two separate secA genes have been identified, one of which ( secA2 ), seems to be directly responsible 
for the protein secretion related to the creation o f the S-layer (Schneewind & Missiakas, 2012). The 
twin arginine translocation system (Tat) has been f ound to be absent from all Clostridium genomes so 
far (Bruggemann  et al , 2003). 
Interestingly, in the previously mentioned recent s tudy on the cell-surface proteins of C. 
perfringens strain ATCC 13124, several of the surface proteins found were predicted to be 
cytoplasmic in nature due to function or lack of si gnal peptide (Alam  et al , 2009). Additionally, this 
phenomenon has been found in an increasing number o f proteins throughout Gram-positive bacteria 
(Alam  et al , 2009; Bukau & Horwich, 1998; Cole  et al , 2005; Severin  et al , 2007; Shimizu  et al , 
2002b; Walz  et al , 2007). In fact, in a previous study it was shown in C. perfringens that the culture 
supernatant following late exponential phase contai ned proteins that were predicted to be intracellula r 
and that did not contain signal sequences (Shimizu  et al , 2002b). ESAT-6 secretions are known to 
support the secretion of proteins that do not conta in a signal peptide sequence (Pallen, 2002). 
ExPortal systems may also play a role but these hav e not been thoroughly studied in C. perfringens 
(Rosch & Caparon, 2004).   
Despite the overwhelming support for translocated p roteins without signal peptide sequences, 
the mechanism by which these proteins are able to e xit the cell without a signal peptide sequence is 
yet unknown (Bendtsen  et al , 2005; Wang  et al , 2013; Wickner & Schekman, 2005). Some authors 
have recently suggested piggy-backing on proteins w ith signal sequences as a possible mechanism of 
transport for non-signal peptide sequence proteins (Wickner & Schekman, 2005). In E. coli,  
environmental extracellular stress on the cell wall  can cause proteins to selectively escape from the 
intracellular space due to a stress response (Vazqu ez-Laslop  et al , 2001). Non-classical protein 
secretion appears to be tightly regulated and influ enced by specific stimuli and may represent a stres s 28 
 response (Wang  et al , 2013). Therefore, the main aim of this non-classi cal protein secretion pathway 
may be to protect the cell from the undesirable eff ects of the stressor or may aid in bacterial virule nce 
(Wang  et al , 2013). As previously mentioned, C. perfringens  does have a functioning BceRS two-
component system for stress response (Jordan  et al , 2008). However, there does not appear to be any 
signal or motif that is consistent with these non-c lassically secreted proteins, making prediction of 
these proteins difficult (Bendtsen  et al , 2005). 
Clostridium perfringens Cell Growth  
The growth and nutritional requirements of C. perfringens  were determined almost 
immediately upon the discovery of the species, as i t was an important food contaminant (Fuchs & 
Bonde, 1957). In most cases, C. perfringens  requires complex media to grow, suggesting that th e 
species possesses a very simplistic metabolic syste m and cannot synthesize many components 
required for growth and survival (Caldwell, 2000; F uchs & Bonde, 1957). The generation time of C. 
perfringens can be as rapid as 7.4 minutes under optimal condit ions (37 to 45°C, rich media), 
confirming the role of this bacterium as a contamin ant in meat and poultry products and a common 
cause of food-borne illness (Shimizu  et al , 2002a; Smith & Schaffner, 2004; Willardsen  et al , 1979). 
C. perfringens is a strictly anaerobic bacterium that is capable o f anaerobic respiration and 
fermentation (Madigan  et al , 2009). The recent genome sequencing of C. perfringens strain 13 has 
shown that C. perfringens is capable of utilizing a variety of sugars as a ca rbon source, including 
fructose, galactose, glycogen, lactose, maltose, ma nnose, raffinose, starch and sucrose, both via 
culture studies and the presence of the necessary g lycolytic genes within the genome (Shimizu  et al , 
2002a; Sneath, 1986).  C. perfringens was determined to have the complete set of enzymes necessary 
for both glycolysis and glycogen metabolism, but is  lacking the genes necessary for the tricarboxylic 
acid (TCA) cycle or any respiratory chain related p roteins (Shimizu  et al , 2002a). Additionally, all of 
the genes responsible for anaerobic fermentation ar e present in the C. perfringens genome, resulting 29 
 in the production of lactate, alcohol, acetate and butyrate, which have been found in culture studies 
(Shimizu  et al , 2002a; Sneath, 1986). Fermentation results in the  production of hydrogen gas and 
carbon monoxide, both of which are necessary for th e creation of an anaerobic environment in host 
tissues and are directly responsible for the growth  and survival of C. perfringens in the host (Shimizu  
et al , 2002a). In addition to the typical fermentation p athways, genes necessary for amino acid 
fermentation are also found in C. perfringens , specifically for the fermentation of serine and t hreonine 
(Shimizu  et al , 2002a).  C. perfringens is capable of switching between anaerobic respirati on and 
fermentation based on the electron acceptor present  in the environment. 
Clostridium perfringens Azoreductase Function 
Rafii and colleagues were instrumental in the initi al culture studies of strictly anaerobic 
intestinal bacteria. In their initial studies, they  isolated several species and strains of bacteria w hich 
they found to be capable of reducing the azo dye, D irect Blue 15, on a non-denaturing SDS gel assay 
(Rafii & Cerniglia, 1990). Among these bacteria tha t seemed to possess an azoreductase was C. 
perfringens (Rafii & Cerniglia, 1990).  Based on the single zone of Direct Blue 15 clearing  on the gel, 
it was predicted that C. perfringens only contained one azoreductase enzyme, which Rafii  and 
colleagues proceeded to extract from the gel and pu rify (Rafii & Cerniglia, 1990). Upon purification 
and analysis on an SDS-PAGE gel, it was determined that the putative azoreductase was actually 
dimeric in nature (Rafii & Cerniglia, 1990). The pu tative azoreductase did not require the exogenous 
addition of a flavin cofactor for activity, but int erestingly did require the absence of oxygen (Rafii  & 
Cerniglia, 1990; Rafii  et al , 1990). Culture studies suggested that the azoredu ctase production was 
constitutive and extracellular, a finding which was  confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy with 
gold-labeled antibodies to the putative azoreductas e (Rafii & Cerniglia, 1990; Rafii & Cerniglia, 
1993; Rafii  et al , 1990). Rafii's azoreductase was found to be antig enically similar to a putative 
azoreductase from Eubacterium , which suggested the presence of a conserved domai n in 
azoreductases (Rafii  et al , 1992).  30 
 In their last publication (1999), the Rafii group a ttempted to rescue and characterize this 
putative azoreductase gene in a fragment of DNA, ho wever, their study was not complete (Rafii & 
Coleman, 1999). In 2007, Cristee Wright studied thi s fragment and upon looking deeper into the 
3.8kB fragment that Rafii had suggested contained t he azoreductase, Wright found that this fragment 
contained a number of open reading frames, none of which were expected to code for an azoreductase 
enzyme (Wright, 2007). However, given the high azor eductase activity against Direct Blue 15 seen in 
Rafii's culture studies, there is a high probabilit y that there is a functioning azoreductase present in C. 
perfringens (Rafii & Cerniglia, 1990; Rafii  et al , 1990; Wright, 2007). In her thesis, Cristee Wrigh t 
was able to identify a candidate for the azoreducta se of C. perfringens (Wright, 2007).     
Azoreductase Gene (AzoC) 
Wright identified the gene for the azoreductase of C. perfringens  strain ATCC 3626 through 
searching the available C. perfringens  genome for sequence homology to both the nucleic a cid and 
protein sequences from known bacterial azoreductase s from E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, 
Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus OY1-2  in hopes that there would be a conserved domain wh ich 
aids in conferring azoreductase activity (Wright, 2 007). Wright cloned and expressed her NAD(P)H-
dependent FMN reductase (which contained an FMN-red uctase domain) gene in E. coli , but was 
unable to obtain pure protein (Wright, 2007). Initi al studies with mixed protein showed high 
azoreductase activity against Direct Blue 15, consi stent with the culture studies (Wright, 2007). Pure  
enzyme studies with AzoC would be needed to confirm  that this gene encodes for azoreductase 
activity in C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626.

 Conclusion 
 Very little information is known about azoreductas es that originate from strictly anaerobic 
bacteria. Much of the information comes from whole cell culture studies of strict anaerobes isolated 
from the human gastrointestinal tract. The purpose of this study is to fully characterize the 
azoreductase of C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 in terms of enzyme structure and f unction in order 
to fill the gap in the literature regarding azoredu ctases originating from strictly anaerobic bacteria . 32

IDENTIFICATION, ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A  NOVEL 
AZOREDUCTASE FROM CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS 
The following chapter is based off of a publication  in the journal Anaerobe (2012, 18 :229-234) 
and appears here with the journal’s permission. 
Abstract 
 Azo dyes are used widely in the textile, pharmaceut ical, cosmetic and food industries as 
colorants and are often sources of environmental po llution. There are many microorganisms that 
are able to reduce azo dyes by use of an azoreducta se enzyme. It is through the reduction of the 
azo bonds of the dyes that carcinogenic metabolites  are produced thereby a concern for human 
health. The field of research on azoreductases is g rowing, but there is very little information 
available on azoreductases from strict anaerobic ba cteria. In this study, the azoreductase gene was 
identified in Clostridium perfringens , a pathogen that is commonly found in the human in testinal 
tract. C. perfringens shows high azoreductase activity, especially in the  presence of the common 
dye Direct Blue 15. A gene that encodes for a flavo protein was isolated and expressed in E.coli, 
and further purified and tested for azoreductase ac tivity. The azoreductase (known as AzoC) was 
characterized by enzymatic reaction assays using di fferent dyes. AzoC activity was highest in the 
presence of two cofactors, NADH and FAD. A strong c ofactor effect was shown with some dyes, 
as dye reduction occurred without the presence of t he AzoC (cofactors alone). AzoC was shown 33 
 to perform best at a pH of 9, at room temperature, and in an anaerobic environment. Enzyme 
kinetics studies suggested  that the association between enzyme and substrate i s strong. The results 
show that AzoC from C. perfringens  has azoreductase activity.   
Introduction 
Azo dyes are synthetic organic colorants used widel y in the manufacture of textiles, 
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and a wide variety of f oods. Each year, almost 1 million tons of azo 
dyes are produced worldwide (Suzuki  et al , 2001). Most of the dyes are released into the 
environment as effluent in industrial wastewater an d, because of their recalcitrance, persist there 
as pollutants (Nakanishi  et al , 2001). In addition, azo dyes are linked to causin g several types of 
cancers in humans (Rafii & Coleman, 1999).  
Azoreductases cleave the azo linkage (N=N) of azo d yes in a reductive process that 
produces aromatic amines and decolorizes the dye (N akanishi  et al , 2001; Stolz, 2001). The genes 
encoding azoreductases have been cloned and charact erized from a number of bacterial strains 
(Blumel & Stolz, 2003; Chen  et al , 2005a; Chen  et al , 2004; Nakanishi  et al , 2001; Sugiura  et al , 
2006). The enzymes, reported to be flavoproteins, r ange from 19 - 30 kDa in size and require 
either NADH or NADPH as electron donors. Bacteria f rom the human intestinal tract can be 
exposed to azo dyes from environmental contaminatio n and from consumption of dyes in foods 
and drugs (Dillon  et al , 1994; Marmion, 1991). In the intestine, bacterial  azoreductases reduce the 
dyes to their component aromatic amines. Some of th ese amines are carcinogenic and mutagenic 
to humans, causing cancer of the kidney, bladder, s tomach, and liver (Brown & Devito, 1993; 
Chung  et al , 2000; Rafii & Coleman, 1999). Several species of intestinal bacteria with 
azoreductase activity have been isolated and studie d (Chung & Cerniglia, 1992; Gingell & 
Walker, 1971; Rafii  et al , 1990; Song  et al , 2003; Walker  et al , 1971). Among those having high 
azoreductase activity is the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium perfringens .  34 
 C. perfringens  is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic and spor e-forming bacterium 
(Ahmad  et al , 2010). Some strains contain catalase, peroxidase,  and superoxide dismutase but 
still require low oxygen tension and low oxidation reduction potential. C. perfringens is 
considered a pathogen as it produced enterotoxins t hat cause a range of symptoms from mild 
enterotoxaemia to fatal gas gangrene (Ahmad  et al , 2010). The bacterium possesses both 
anaerobic respiration and fermentative capabilities , which provides it with a diverse metabolic 
capacity (Ahmad  et al , 2010). One major metabolic activity found is azor eductase. The current 
study isolated an azoreductase gene from the chromo some of C. perfringens, expressed the gene 
in Escherichia coli , and purified and characterized the enzyme activit y using several azo dyes. 
This is the first time a flavoprotein from C. perfringens  has been identified as having 
azoreductase activity.   
Background Information and Previous Work (Wright, 2 007) 
To determine if C. perfringens cultures were able to efficiently reduce azo dyes, Direct 
Blue 15 was added to the culture and at approximate ly 4 hours the dye was completely reduced, 
which suggested that the organism contained an azor eductase. No dye reduction was seen in the 
accompanying control. Other dyes besides Direct Blu e 15 were also tested, along with dye only 
controls; over a period of 12 hours, most of the ot her dyes were reduced under the control 
conditions, without the presence of the whole cells . Direct Blue 15 showed no reduction under 
these control conditions, but a great reduction in the presence of the whole cells.   
tblastn and tblastp software (National Center for T oxicological Research) were used to 
search the C. perfringens  chromosome for proteins showing homology to the de duced nucleotide 
and amino acid sequences of the azoreductases from E. coli , Enterococcus faecalis , 
Staphylococcus aureus  and Bacillus  OY1-2. Since the nucleotide and amino acid sequenc es of 
known azoreductases revealed no conserved sequences  based on primary alignments, a more 35 
 rigorous screening method was implemented. A list o f known bacterial azoreductases and their 
conserved domains was obtained from the Universal P rotein Resource (UniProt) Knowledgebase. 
The putative azoreductase gene from C. perfringens  was identified by first identifying bacterial 
azoreductase conserved domains which were found to be homologous to either an 
FMN_reductase or a flavodoxin_2 conserved region. T he Protein Family Database (PFAM) was 
used to identify proteins with these conserved doma ins within the C. perfringens  chromosome 
and also to compare their function(s) to that of kn own azoreductases. Using PFAM, a single 
putative NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase having a c onserved FMN_reductase domain was 
identified in the C. perfringens  chromosome. The gene, annotated as a hypothetical protein was 
designated azoC  for the purpose of the study. Analysis of the gene  coordinates revealed the ORF 
to be part of an operon with four other ORFs – two hypothetical proteins with unknown function, 
a probable anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, and a hypothetical protein thought to be involved 
in 2’-deoxyribonucleotide metabolism (Figure 9).

36 
  C. perfringens  strain ATCC 3626 was grown on sheep blood agar pla tes in an 
anaerobic jar for 3 days at 37°C and used to inocul ate 10 mL of anaerobic brain heart infusion 
broth (BHI) in an anaerobic chamber. The broth cult ure was used for the preparation of 
chromosomal DNA. Genomic DNA was extracted from a f resh 10 mL culture of C. perfringens  
strain ATCC 3626 according to the Masterpure Gram P ositive DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre 
Biotechnologies). The azoC  open reading frame was amplified using C. perfringens  genomic 
DNA as template. The forward primer ( flavoF3 ) included an Xho1 site before the start codon: 5’-  
CGGCC TCGAG ATGAA AGTAT TATTA GTTA - 3’. The revers e primer ( flavo0915r ) 
included a BamH1 site downstream of the azoC  ORF: 5’ – GTGAA AGGAT CCTTA TCTAA 
TAAAA TTAGT TCTTT CTCTT TC - 3’. 
Template  DNA and primers for the control reaction were provi ded in the TOPO TA 
cloning kit (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out in a Perkin Elmer 480 DNA thermal cycler. 
Conditions for amplification were followed as outli ned in the TOPO TA cloning manual 
(Invitrogen) - one cycle of 2 min at 94°C, 25 cycle s with each cycle consisting of 1 min at 94°C, 
1 min at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C, and a final exten sion of 7 min at 72°C. The products were 
analyzed on a 1% agarose gel after staining with et hidium bromide.   
The PCR product containing the azoC  ORF was directly cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO TA 
vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The TOPO clone a nd pET15b (Novagen) were each cleaved 
by sequential digestion with XhoI and BamHI restric tion enzymes, each time at 37°C for 12 
hours. The 721 bp product (Figure 10A) from cleavag e of the TOPO clone was purified using the 
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and ligated be tween the XhoI and BamHI sites of 
pET15b in a reaction containing 0.1 U T4 DNA ligase  and carried out at 4ºC for 16 hours. A 2 µl 
volume of the ligation mixture was used to transfor m 20 µl of NovaBlueDE3 E. coli cells 
(Novagen). Following plasmid extractions, positive clones were confirmed by PCR with the 
insert specific primers flavoF3 and flavo0915r and by simultaneous cleavage with XhoI and 37 
 BamHI. The recombinant DNA (pAzoC) was used to tran sform BL21pLysS E. coli cells, which 
were deficient in protease activity, and used for e xpression of the azoreductase. The induced 
protein produced a band at 22.6 kDa based on the SD S-PAGE gel (Figure 10B).

Azo Dyes  
  Azo dyes were purchased from the following compan ies: Direct Blue 15 (MP

 Purification of the Azoreductase Enzyme   
The E. coli  cells containing the pAzoC (as prepared above) wer e inoculated into a 5 mL 
LB broth containing ampicillin (100 µg/mL) and incu bated overnight with shaking at 200 rpm at 
37ºC. The cells were transferred to a large flask c ontaining 1 L LB broth containing ampicillin 
(100 µg/mL) and incubated shaking at 200 rpm at 37º C until the OD 600  of the culture was at 0.6. 
The cells were then induced with isopropyl-beta-D-t hiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mM final 
concentration) for an additional 3 hours. This cult ure was then centrifuged (6000 x g, 10 minutes, 
4ºC) to pellet the cells. The supernatant was disca rded as bacterial waste and the pellets were 
stored at -20ºC until protein purification could oc cur.   
The pellet was thawed and resuspended in 10 mL of a  lysis/wash buffer (20% glycerol, 
50 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 750 mM sodium chl oride and 20 mM imidazole in double-
distilled water, pH 8.0). Lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL final  concentration) was added to each of the 
pellets and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Cell p ellets were sonicated with a Sonic 300 
dismembranator with an intermediate tip and relativ e output of 60%. Sonication occurred in 10 
intervals of 5 seconds each. The cell suspension re mained on ice when not being sonicated to 
ensure that the protein was not denatured by the he at generated by sonication. The suspension 
was centrifuged (10,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4ºC) to pe llet the cell debris and to leave the protein in 
solution. 
The supernatant was subjected to nickel-nitrilotria cetic acid  (Ni-NTA) slurry (Clon-Tech) 
in a 1:1 ratio of supernatant to slurry in a glass frit column (Kimble-Chase Flex Column). The 
Histidine-tag of the protein allows for this purifi cation procedure to be effective. All steps were 
carried out at 4ºC to ensure that the protein did n ot denature during the process. The samples were 
incubated at 4ºC for 1 hour on a BioDancer orbital shaker (New Brunswick Scientific) at medium 
speed to ensure that the His-tagged protein would s tick to the Ni-NTA resin. Following protein 39 
 exposure to the column, the excess solution was dra ined from the column (pre-wash fraction) and 
the resin was washed with lysis/wash buffer until t he effluent from the column was clear (wash 
fractions). Following washing, the protein was elut ed from the resin by exposing the resin to 
elution buffer (20% glycerol, 50 mM sodium monobasi c phosphate, 750 mM sodium chloride, 
250 mM imidazole, double-distilled water, pH 8.0). At least four elutions were carried out to 
ensure that all protein was eluted from the resin. Elutions were saved and stored at -20ºC. 
All elutions were analyzed with an SDS-PAGE gel. SD S-PAGE analysis was performed 
as described previously (Laemmli, 1970). Protein sa mples were prepared for analysis directly 
following protein purification by adding a 1X conce ntration of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (4X 
loading buffer = 0.06 M TRIS-HCl pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.0025% (w/v) 
bromophenol blue). Beta-mercaptoethanol (5%) was us ed to denature disulfide bonds. Protein 
samples were boiled for 15 minutes and then loaded (20 µL) onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. 
Coomassie blue was used for staining and the protei n bands were visualized and photographed in 
comparison to a 250 kDa protein ladder (New England  Biolabs). Protein concentration was 
determined with a Nanodrop spectrometer, using the Molar Extinction Coefficient of the protein 
(0.880) to determine the protein concentration. The  Molar Extinction Coefficient was determined 
by using the NCBI database. All samples were concen trated using an Amicon Ultrafiltration cell 
under Nitrogen pressure and a Millipore filter (Reg enerated Cellulose membrane, NMWL 
10,000) to achieve a protein concentration of betwe en 2 and 5 mg/mL.    
Pure Enzyme Assays – Anaerobic and Aerobic Conditio ns 
 Assays for azoreductase activity for the pure AzoC  protein were carried out both 
anaerobically and aerobically. All experiments were  performed in triplicate. Enzyme reactions 
were carried out in a 1.5 mL-polystyrene cuvette (S igma-Aldrich) with a total reaction volume of 
1 mL. The buffer used in most cases (except for spe cific pH experiments) was 25 mM TRIS, pH 40 
 9.0. Although different azo dyes were tested the fi nal concentration tested was consistently 20 
µM. Experiments were performed to determine the opt imal enzyme concentration in the reaction 
by altering the concentration of the protein and on ce the optimal AzoC concentration was found, 
different cofactors were tested (NADH and NADPH). T he concentration of NADH (Acros 
Organics) was also altered in experiments to determ ine optimal conditions for dye reduction (10 
mM NADH). FAD (Sigma-Aldrich) and FMN (Sigma-Aldric h) were both tested as cofactors and 
FAD was found to be an essential component to the a zoreductase function of AzoC at an optimal 
concentration of 2 mM. 
Reactions were prepared by mixing the appropriate b uffer, azo dye, water and the 
enzyme together in the cuvette and bubbling with ni trogen at a rate of 1 nitrogen bubble per 
second for 10 minutes. Immediately following the ni trogen bubbling, mineral oil was added to the 
top of the cuvette to prevent the introduction of o xygen into the newly anaerobic system. Aerobic 
experiments were performed without the nitrogen bub bling step and without the addition of 
mineral oil. To begin the reaction, 10 mM NADH and 2 mM FAD were mixed together 
separately and then added to the reaction and mixed  together carefully as to not introduce oxygen 
into the system. The reaction was scanned using a S himadzu UV-1650 PC spectrophotometer. 
Each azo dye was scanned prior to the reaction with  the spectrophotometer to determine the 
optimal absorbance for each dye (all dye absorption  values were above 340 nm and extinction 
coefficients were used in determining the final con centration of dyes). In some cases, an 
absorbance was selected that was not the optimal du e to interference by the absorbance of FAD, 
which is orange in color. The absorbencies tested w ere as follows: Direct Blue 15 (602.5 nm), 
Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A (534.00 nm), Congo Red (531.00 nm), Tartrazine (425.00 nm), 
Janus Green (597.50 nm), Trypan Blue (533.50 nm), B uffalo Black NBR (614.50 nm), Methyl 
Red (430.00 nm) and Eriochrome Black T (527.50 nm).  Dye concentration was interpolated from 
absorbencies by making standard curves of dye conce ntrations to find the extinction coefficient. 41 
 This was determined to be a spectrophotometer-speci fic equation of a best fit line. Experiments 
were also done to determine the optimal order of th e addition of reactants to the system where 
each of the components (dye, AzoC, cofactors) were added last in separate experiments.   
Pure Enzyme Assays – Cofactor Effect 
To determine the effect of the cofactor on the enzy me reaction, experiments were 
performed that lacked the azoreductase and containe d a protein control, albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). 
The protein control would serve to show whether the  azoreductase was causing the reduction of 
the dye or if the cofactors and the presence of a p rotein was causing the reduction. Experiments 
were also performed that did not contain a protein and showed the effects of the cofactors 
themselves. In the case of the protein control, 138  µg of albumin was added to the reaction in 
place of AzoC. For the cofactor controls, only NADH  and FAD were added to the reaction; no 
protein was present in these experiments.  
Pure Enzyme Assays – Optimal Temperature 
 To determine the optimal temperature for the azore ductase enzyme to work, experiments 
were carried out at several different temperatures (25ºC/room temperature, 30ºC, 37ºC, 45ºC and 
60°C). Prior to the reaction taking place, all comp onents except for the cofactors were incubated 
in their cuvette in a water bath to reach the desir ed temperature. The cuvette was moved to the 
spectrophotometer to begin the experiment with the cofactors and then promptly moved back to 
the water bath. The absorbance was recorded every 5  minutes until the reading reached a plateau. 
Pure Enzyme Assays – Optimal pH 
 To determine the optimal pH for AzoC to work, seve ral different pH buffers were 
prepared to test azoreductase activity: sodium acet ate pH 4.0 and 5.0, potassium phosphate pH 
6.0 and 7.0, TRIS pH 8.0 and 9.0, sodium bicarbonat e pH 10.0 and 11.0, and potassium chloride 42 
 pH 12.0. Enzyme experiments were conducted as descr ibed above by only changing the pH of the 
buffer used. 
Pure Enzyme Assays – Effect of Oxygen 
 Since AzoC is from an anaerobic organism, there wa s curiosity as to the effect of oxygen 
on the protein itself. To study this, anaerobic and  aerobic experiments were performed and 
compared as mentioned above. In another experiment,  an anaerobic reaction at the optimal 
conditions was prepared and taken to complete dye r eduction. Following dye reduction, the 
cuvette was bubbled again (in one case with Nitroge n and in another case with Oxygen). Dye and 
cofactors were added into the reaction and the cuve tte scanned. This provides an understanding of 
the regeneration of the enzyme in the presence of o xygen as compared to anaerobically. 
Pure Enzyme Assays – Enzyme Kinetics 
 A brief study of the enzyme kinetics was performed  by taking one component of the 
experiment (dye, FAD, NADH) and changing the concen tration of that component while keeping 
the others constant. The optimal conditions were 20  µM dye, 10 mM NADH and 2 mM FAD.  
During the kinetics experiments, the optimal concen tration of one of these components was tested 
by either increasing or decreasing in hopes of find ing a saturation point for the enzyme. Results 
were graphed and analyzed by a Lineweaver-Burke plo t to determine Km and Vmax. 
Results 
Pure Enzyme Assays – Initial Work and Cofactor Effe ct 
Bacterial azoreductases require NADH and/or NADPH a s an electron donor and the 
cofactor FMN and/or FAD can serve as a prosthetic g roup. AzoC was determined to be NADH-
dependent as it demonstrated the highest activity, with NADPH showing no significant dye 
reduction activity when tested as an electron donor  for the reaction for the reduction of Direct 43 
 Blue 15 (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). FAD and FM N were also tested and the results showed 
that neither are acceptable for the reduction Direc t Blue 15 by themselves (less than 10% dye 
reduction occurs) with AzoC, producing non-signific ant dye reduction (p-value >0.05, 95% 
confidence). However, when these flavin cofactors a re combined with NADH a great reduction 
occurs, with up to 100% of the dye being reduced (F igure 11). This produces a statistically 
significant azo dye reduction at a 95% confidence i nterval (p-value <0.001). Comparing FMN by 
itself to FMN/NADH, the cofactor combination of FMN /NADH showed a five-fold increase in 
dye reduction, a result that is statistically signi ficant at a 95% confidence interval (p-value 
<0.001). FAD/NADH compared to FAD by itself showed an 8.5-fold increase in dye reduction 
when the cofactor combination of FAD/NADH was used,  which is also statistically significant at 
a 95% confidence interval (p-value <0.001).  
Controls that test the reducing effects of the cofa ctors themselves on the dye were 
implemented to understand what effect the enzyme is  playing compared to the cofactors. 
Although FMN/NADH produced the overall greatest dro p in Direct Blue 15 absorbance, the 
control (without AzoC) showed just as much activity  (Figure 11), resulting in non-significant dye 
reduction by FMN/NADH (p-value >0.05, 95% confidenc e). This was not the case with 
FAD/NADH, which showed great activity with AzoC, bu t significantly less activity when without 
AzoC (Figure 11). In contrast to FMN/NADH, the FAD/ NADH combination with AzoC shows 
significant dye reduction over its non-enzymatic co ntrol at a 95% confidence interval (p-value 
<0.001). Due to this fact, the FAD/NADH combination  was used in testing. Interestingly, the 
greatest reduction of the dye occurred when NADH an d FAD were mixed together and added last 
to the reaction mixture, thus allowing time for the  azo dye substrate to interact with AzoC prior to 
the addition of the cofactor mixture. 44 
  
Figure 11.  Effect of Cofactors on Direct Blue 15 Reduction by AzoC. Comparison of FAD/NADH with 
AzoC and FAD/NADH without AzoC shows a significant difference in dye reduction in the reaction with 
the enzyme (p-value <0.001, 95% confidence). Compar ison of FMN/NADH with AzoC and FMN/NADH 
without AzoC does not show a significant difference  in dye reduction between the reaction with the 
enzyme and the non-enzymatic control (p-value >0.05 , 95% confidence).  
 
Upon further examination of the dye reduction by Az oC, a cofactor effect was noticed. 
With Direct Blue 15, the presence of FMN/NADH alone  was enough to reduce the dye, making 
dye reduction with AzoC, FMN/NADH insignificant ove r the FMN/NADH cofactors alone (p-
value >0.05, 95% confidence) (Figure 11). When no p rotein was present, a slight reduction in dye 
absorbance occurred with FAD/NADH (less than 35% dy e reduction) but a large reduction for 
FMN/NADH (100% dye reduction) suggesting that the r eduction in dye was caused by the 
cofactors themselves. However, the FAD/NADH require d the presence of the protein to produce 
significant Direct Blue 15 reduction and the presen ce of any protein, as shown by the albumin 
control in Table 3 (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence).  This was not the case with the individual 
cofactors (FMN or NADH) themselves, but only occurr ed when the two cofactors were mixed 
together and added to the reaction. Other dyes were  also tested with AzoC and this cofactor effect 
was also seen with some of the other dyes. A simila r effect was observed with other dyes (Janus 
45 
 Green, Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A and Eriochrome B lack T) as the specific activity was not 
significantly different for the albumin control and  AzoC (Table 3, unhighlighted rows, p-value 
>0.05, 95% confidence). Significantly, Direct Blue 15 undergoes the greatest reduction by AzoC, 
compared to other azo dyes tested when taking the n on-AzoC containing control and therefore the 
effect of the cofactors into account (Table 3).

Pure Enzyme Assays – Optimal Temperature  
 Between the five temperatures tested, no significa nt difference in dye reduction was seen 
(p-value >0.05, 95% confidence) (Figure 12). The op timal temperature of AzoC was between 
30˚C and 37˚C (Figure 12). It appears that temperat ures that are near body temperature are the 
most optimal. Interestingly, when comparing the cof actor effect at 37°C versus 25°C, the cofactor 
effect is less of a factor at 25°C, suggesting that  25°C is actually the more optimal temperature to 
use in experimentation (Tables 4 and 5). AzoC at 37 °C showed a 2.0-fold increase over its 
control, while AzoC at 25°C showed a 2.4-fold incre ase over its control.  46

 The optimal pH of the reaction was determined to b e pH 9.0 (Figure 13). Upon further

 the optimal pH. Due to the high variability at the increased pH, pH 9 was found to be the most 
statistically significant (p-value <0.05, 95% confi dence).

Pure Enzyme Assays – Effect of Oxygen  
 When AzoC was exposed to oxygen, the specific acti vity was greatly reduced when 
compared to the anaerobic experiment, as a four-fol d increase was seen with the anaerobic 
sample (Table 5, Figure 14). This suggests AzoC is sensitive to oxygen, which has been reported 
by others (Bragger  et al , 1997). This sensitivity may be due to oxygen oxid izing the cofactor 
thereby inhibiting the enzyme reaction (Chang  et al , 2001). In addition, oxygen may be a 
preferable electron acceptor over the azo groups (C hung & Stevens, 1993; Srinivasan & 
Viraraghavan, 2010). Using the same sample reaction , anaerobic activation followed by aerobic 
activation and finally anaerobic reactivation produ ced activities that were high, low and high, 
suggesting that oxygen may outcompete the dye for e lectrons, as mentioned above (Figure 15). 
48 
 However, it is possible that the oxygen is oxidizin g both the cofactors and dyes. On the other 
hand, without oxygen, an azo compound will act as s ole oxidant, and its reduction rate will be 
controlled solely by the rate of formation of the e lectron donor (reduced flavin nucleotides). It 
must also be noted that, under aerobic conditions, dye reduction does still occur, however, the 
reduction occurs at a much slower rate than the ana erobic dye reduction reaction.

 Pure Enzyme Assays – Enzyme Kinetics  
 Enzyme kinetics experiments were completed to dete rmine the Km and Vmax values for 
azo dye, FAD and NADH. The data suggest that the re action specificity between the enzyme and 
substrates is strong, producing Km values of 0.005 μM, 0.00018 mM, and 0.0081 mM when the 
dye concentration, FAD concentration, and NADH conc entrations were altered, respectively. 
Vmax values were 0.42 μM Direct Blue 15/min/mg AzoC , 0.012 mM FAD/min/mg AzoC, and 
0.26 mM NADH/min/mg AzoC.   
Discussion 
The goal of this study was to characterize the enzy me predicted to be the cause of the 
azoreductase activity of C. perfringens.  In a previous study, Cristee Wright analyzed a 3.8  kb 
fragment of C. perfringens  DNA that had been shown to exhibit minimal activit y, however no 
gene for azoreductase was found within this DNA fra gment (Wright, 2007). Cristee Wright used 
information from known bacterial azoreductases and located an open reading frame in the C. 
perfringens  chromosome that coded for a putative azoreductase (Wright, 2007). The protein, 
AzoC, was overexpressed in E. coli  and the activity of the cell-free extract was test ed on the 
common azo dye Direct Blue 15. These results sugges t that AzoC reduces Direct Blue 15 in a 
NADH-dependent process under anoxic conditions. 
The protein was successfully purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Out of the 
variety of dyes tested, Direct Blue 15 was the most  greatly reduced by the enzyme. It was also 
found that, besides needing NADH for reduction, FAD  is also essential for the enzyme to reach 
its full azoreductase potential. FMN did produce a great reduction in dye absorbance when 
combined with NADH and AzoC, but it also produced a  similar drop in absorbance when not in 
the presence of AzoC, suggesting that this combinat ion of cofactors is actually reducing the dye. 
The cofactors used in the experiment (FAD and NADH)  were shown to have a great effect on 50 
 some dyes (specifically Janus Green, Cibacron Brill iant Red 3B-A and Eriochrome Black T) 
suggesting that in some cases it is possible for th e cofactors themselves to be able to reduce dye 
absorbance. Thus, cofactors only or in the presence  of a protein control should always be used as 
a control to make sure that the dye reduction that is occurring is due to the azoreductase enzyme 
being tested and not due to other components of the  reaction.     
The optimal conditions for the azoreduction reactio n were found and are unexpected. The 
optimal pH was found to be at pH 9, which is unusua l for an intestine-dwelling organism like C. 
perfringens . However, the pI of AzoC was found to be 8.72, whi ch corresponds to the optimal 
pH. This suggests that AzoC may not be acting to it s full potential within the intestinal tract. 
Though the enzyme seemed to work best at 30-37°C, t he controls told a different story, as there 
was a strong cofactor effect at these increased tem peratures. The optimal temperature was found 
to be at 25°C, which is also unusual for an intesti ne-dwelling organism. However, C. perfringens  
is also commonly found outside of the body and in t he soil (Ahmad  et al , 2010). These optimal 
conditions were shown to be just that by enzyme kin etics studies that showed high specificity in 
enzyme and substrate binding and reaction time. 
AzoC was found to have a greater reducing potential  for the dye when under anaerobic 
conditions than aerobic conditions and may be sensi tive to oxygen in some way, which has been 
reported by others (Bragger  et al , 1997). This sensitivity may be due to oxygen oxid izing the 
cofactor thereby inhibiting the enzyme reaction (Ch ang et al , 2001). In addition, oxygen may be a 
preferable electron acceptor over the azo groups of  the azo dyes (Chung & Stevens, 1993; 
Srinivasan & Viraraghavan, 2010). However, it is po ssible that the oxygen is oxidizing both the 
cofactors and dyes. When in the presence of oxygen,  there appears to be competition between the 
oxygen and the azo dye for reduction by the azoredu ctase, thus it was found that performing 
experiments under anaerobic conditions gave the bes t results and faster reduction times for Direct 
Blue 15. On the other hand, without oxygen, an azo compound will act as sole oxidant, and its 51 
 reduction rate will be controlled solely by the rat e of formation of the electron donor (reduced 
flavin nucleotides). A schematic of the predicted P ing-Pong Bi Bi reaction for AzoC is shown in 
Figure 16. In absence of oxygen, Figure 16A is expe cted, whereas in the presence of oxygen, 
Figure 16B is expected.

Presence of Oxygen ( B). 
 
Researchers suggest several mechanisms by which ana erobic bacteria are able to reduce 
azo dyes. One hypothesis is that these organisms po ssess true azoreductases that are specific in 
their function. Another hypothesis, and perhaps the  most popular, is that reduced electron carriers 
(e.g. flavins) mediate reduction by a redox mechani sm in which azo dyes are non-specific 
electron acceptors. Since our protein works best in  the presence of a flavin (FAD), it can be 
suggested that the second mechanism is that which f its our AzoC.      
In conclusion, our results showed that AzoC from Clostridium perfringens  has 
azoreductase activity. Optimal conditions for the e nzyme were found to be pH 9.0 and at room 
temperature (25°C) and with the cofactors NADH and FAD. A cofactor effect was observed 
during experimentation, suggesting that an experime ntal condition containing the cofactors 
52 
 themselves and the dye, without the azoreductase, s hould be used as a control to understand the 
effect that the cofactors have on dye reduction. Az oC was also found to be oxygen sensitive, as 
AzoC performs enzymatically better under anoxic con ditions than in the presence of oxygen. To 
our knowledge, this is the first study in which the  ORF for a putative azoreductase or flavoprotein 
was rescued from a strict anaerobe, as well as clon ed, expressed, purified, and characterized as to 
have azoreductase activity.

 CHAPTER III 
 
 
THE NON-ENZYMATIC REDUCTION OF AZO DYES BY FLAVIN A ND NICOTINAMIDE 
COFACTORS UNDER VARYING CONDITIONS 
The following chapter is based off of a publication  in the journal Anaerobe (2013, 23 :87-96) and 
appears here with the journal’s permission. 
Abstract 
Azo dyes are ubiquitous in products and often becom e environmental pollutants due to 
their anthropogenic nature. Azoreductases are enzym es which are present within many bacteria 
and are capable of breaking down the azo dyes via r eduction of the azo bond. Often, though, 
carcinogenic aromatic amines are formed as metaboli tes and are of concern to humans. 
Azoreductases function via an oxidation-reduction r eaction and require cofactors (a nicotinamide 
cofactor and sometimes a flavin cofactor) to perfor m their function. Non-enzymatic reduction of 
azo dyes in the absence of an azoreductase enzyme h as been suggested in previous studies, but 
has never been studied in detail in terms of varyin g cofactor combinations, different oxygen states 
or pH’s, nor has the enzymatic reduction been compa red to azoreduction in terms of dye 
reduction or metabolites produced, which was the ai m of this study. Reduction of azo dyes by 
different cofactor combinations was found to occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions 
and under physiologically-relevant pH’s to produce the same metabolites as an azoreductase. 
These results show that, in some cases, the non-enz ymatic reduction by the cofactors was found 
to be equal to that seen with the azoreductase, sug gesting that all dye reduction in these cases is  54 
 due to the cofactors themselves. This study details  the importance of the use of a cofactor-only 
control when studying azoreductase enzymes. 
Introduction 
Azoreductases are enzymes that have been linked to several types of cancers in humans 
(Chung  et al , 2006). These enzymes are found within bacteria re siding in the human intestinal 
tract where they convert azo dyes to carcinogenic m etabolites (Ryan  et al , 2010). Globally, more 
than 2000 different varieties of azo dyes are produ ced, which accounts for more than 50% of total 
dye production (Ryan  et al , 2010). These dyes are used in foods, beverages, c osmetics, textiles, 
papers, pharmaceuticals and many other industries a nd are classified by the presence of a double 
nitrogen (azo, R-N=N-R) bond (dos Santos  et al , 2007; Ryan  et al , 2010). Environmentally, these 
dyes are seen as a recalcitrant pollutant present i n waste water treatment streams produced from 
various industrial dyeing processes (Saratale  et al , 2011).   
Azo dyes are generally not harmful to humans, howev er, when broken down 
enzymatically by azoreductases, carcinogens are pro duced in some cases (Bardi & Marzona, 
2010; Chung & Cerniglia, 1992). Azoreductases cleav e the azo bond of azo dyes, releasing 
potentially toxic aromatic amines (Ryan  et al , 2010). Of the thousands of azo dyes on the market , 
over 500 of them contain carcinogenic aromatic amin es within their chemical formulation and are 
thus the dyes with which we are concerned about (Ch ung  et al , 2006). Azoreductases have been 
identified in many bacteria of the human intestinal  tract, including Escherichia coli , Enterococcus 
faecalis , Enterococcus faecium , Clostridium perfringens , and many others (Chen  et al , 2004; 
Ghosh  et al , 1993; Macwana  et al , 2010; Rafii  et al , 1997). Because azo dyes can enter our bodies 
through ingestion, it is likely that the reductive cleavage of azo dyes and the release of 
carcinogens in the intestinal tract can be linked t o cancer in humans.  
 55 
 AzoC, an azoreductase that originates from the stri ctly anaerobic bacterium Clostridium 
perfringens , was recently isolated and biochemically character ized (Chapter 2), representing the 
first complete study of a pure azoreductase from a strict anaerobe (Morrison  et al , 2012). 
Clostridium perfringens , while a strictly anaerobic bacteria, is able to s urvive in a vegetative state 
under atmospheric conditions of oxygen (Jean  et al , 2004). Although a study by Rafii and 
Coleman (1999) suggested the presence of another az oreductase in Clostridium perfringens , that 
particular enzyme was tested and showed minimal act ivity (Morrison  et al , 2012; Rafii & 
Coleman, 1999; Wright, 2007). AzoC is the only prov en azoreductase in Clostridium perfringens 
and is different from that of Rafii and Coleman (19 99) (Morrison  et al , 2012; Rafii & Coleman, 
1999; Wright, 2007). We have previously shown (Chap ter 2) AzoC to have high enzymatic 
activity with Direct Blue 15, a large sulfonated az o dye (0.27 U/mg AzoC, where one unit of 
enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to decolorize 1 μmol of dye per 
minute) and with FAD and NADH as the optimal cofact ors for the reaction (Morrison  et al , 
2012). The specific activity, along with determined  Km and Vmax values (Km = 5 nM, Vmax = 
0.42 U/mg protein) is comparable to azoreductases i n the literature and suggests that AzoC is a 
strong and specific azoreductase (Morrison  et al , 2012).  
Azoreductases require cofactors to perform the oxid ation-reduction reaction necessary to 
break the azo bond. Specifically, azoreductases req uire either nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
(NADH) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phospha te (NADPH) as an electron donor, and a 
flavin cofactor, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN ) or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) for 
electron transfer (Feng  et al , 2012). In Chapter 2, it was noted that, under som e circumstances, 
the cofactors necessary for AzoC to function were a ble to reduce azo dyes in the absence of an 
azoreductase (Morrison  et al , 2012). Another study showed similar effects, but focused primarily 
on the non-enzymatic reduction of azo dyes by NADH at a relatively basic pH and did not 
evaluate the effects of alternative cofactors, or c ombinations of cofactors (such as a nicotinamide 56 
 cofactor and a flavin cofactor combined) (Nam & Ren ganathan, 2000). Because there are varied 
azoreductase reaction requirements, it is important  to determine the effect of cofactors on azo dye 
reduction at varied temperatures, pH’s, oxygen stat es, and with a variety of relevant and 
commonly tested azo dyes. This is the first study t hat provides a comprehensive look at the effect 
of NADH, NADPH, FMN and FAD on the reduction of azo  dyes both aerobically and 
anaerobically and at different physiologically rele vant pH values. 
Materials and Methods 
Cofactors and Azo Dyes 
The cofactors used were purchased from the followin g companies: FAD (TCI America), 
FMN (Sigma-Aldrich), NADH (Acros Organics), NADPH ( Applichem), NAD+ (Sigma-Aldrich).  
The azo dyes were purchased from the following comp anies: Direct Blue 15 (MP 
Biomedicals), Methyl Red (Acros Organics), Tartrazi ne (Sigma-Aldrich), Trypan Blue (Kodak), 
Congo Red (Sigma-Aldrich), Eriochrome Black T (MCB) , Janus Green (Sigma-Aldrich), 
Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A (Sigma-Aldrich), Poncea u S (Fluka), Ponceau BS (Sigma-Aldrich), 
Methyl Orange (Allied Chemicals). 
Dye Reduction Assays – Cofactor Specificity 
Assays with the cofactors (FAD, FMN, NADH and NADPH ) were carried out both 
aerobically and anaerobically. All experiments were  performed in triplicate in 1.5 mL polystyrene 
cuvettes (Sigma-Aldrich) with a total reaction volu me of 1 mL. Although different azo dyes were 
tested in each case, the final dye concentration wa s consistently 20 µM prepared in deionized 
water. The buffer was 25 mM potassium phosphate, pH  7.0. Flavin cofactors (FMN and FAD) 
were tested at a final concentration of 2 mM, while  nicotinamide cofactors (NADH and NADPH) 
were tested at 10 mM, as determined to be optimal i n Chapter 2; all cofactors were prepared in 57 
 deionized water (Morrison  et al , 2012). All reactions were performed in a Shimadzu  UV-1650PC 
spectrophotometer. 
Each azo dye was scanned prior to the reaction to d etermine the optimal absorbance for 
each dye in the reaction mixture (dye absorbencies were above 340 nm and extinction coefficients 
were used in determining the concentration of the d yes at the conclusion of the reaction). In the 
case of the blue-absorbing dyes, such as Methyl Red  and Tartrazine, an absorbance was selected 
that was not optimal in an effort to limit interfer ence by the flavin cofactors, which absorb around 
450 nm. The absorbencies for each azo dye tested we re as follows: Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A 
(534.0 nm), Congo Red (531.0 nm), Direct Blue 15 (6 02.5 nm), Eriochrome Black T (527.5 nm), 
Janus Green (597.5 nm), Trypan Blue (533.5 nm), Met hyl Red (430.0 nm), Tartrazine (425.0 
nm), Ponceau S (515.5 nm), Ponceau BS (505.0 nm), M ethyl Orange (465.5 nm). Dye 
concentration was interpolated from a plot of dye a bsorbance to time by making a standard curve 
of dye concentration to find the extinction coeffic ient. The extinction coefficient was determined 
to be spectrophotometer-specific and dependent on a  line of best fit. 
To identify the effect of the cofactor(s) on the dy e absorbance, the cofactors were tested 
by themselves (NADH only, NADPH only, FMN only, FAD  only) and in combinations 
(NADH/FMN, NADH/FAD, NADPH/FMN, NADPH/FAD), under a erobic and anaerobic 
conditions. All reaction conditions were performed by mixing the buffer, appropriate azo dye and 
deionized water together in the cuvette. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the 
appropriate cofactor(s). Cofactors in combination w ere mixed together prior to and after the 
addition to the reaction. Reaction absorbance was s canned every minute up to fifteen minutes at 
an absorbance appropriate for the specific azo dye.  Additional steps were required for the 
anaerobic reactions, which involved bubbling the cu vette with nitrogen for ten minutes at a rate of 
one bubble per second. Mineral oil was then added t o the top of the cuvette in an effort to prevent 
the introduction of oxygen into the reaction mixtur e. The reaction was initiated through the 58 
 addition of the appropriate anaerobically prepared cofactor(s), by piercing the oil overlay with a 
pipette tip and mixing carefully with an inoculatin g loop. 
For comparison to the cofactor dye reductions sampl es, similar reaction conditions and 
methods were tested with the addition of AzoC (144 µg). The following mixtures were tested: 
AzoC with NADH only, NADPH only, FMN only, and FAD only and in combinations, AzoC 
with NADH/FMN, NADH/FAD, NADPH/FMN and NADPH/FAD. A ll reactions were 
performed in triplicate.  
Purification of the Azoreductase (AzoC) 
NovaBlue (DE3) E. coli  cells containing the AzoC-containing plasmid and s ubsequent 
His-tag were prepared by Cristee Wright (see Chapte r 2) (Wright, 2007). The E. coli cells 
containing pAzoC were inoculated into a 5 mL LB bro th containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL final 
concentration) and incubated overnight at 37°C whil e shaking at 200 rpm. This overnight culture 
was transferred to a large Erlenmeyer flask contain ing 1 L LB broth with ampicillin (100 μg/mL 
final concentration) and incubated at 37°C with sha king at 200 rpm until an OD 600  of 0.6 was 
reached. The cultures were then induced with isopro pyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 
mM final concentration) for an additional 3 hours w hile remaining at 37°C with shaking at 200 
rpm. To pellet the cells, the culture was centrifug ed (6000 x g, 10 minutes, 4°C). The supernatant 
was discarded as bacterial waste and the pellet was  stored frozen at -20°C until further 
purification could occur. 
To continue purification of AzoC, the cell pellet f rom above was thawed and resuspended 
in 10 mL of lysis/wash buffer (20% glycerol, 50 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 750 mM 
sodium chloride, 20 mM imidazole, deionized water, pH 8.0). To lyse cells, lysozyme (0.1 
mg/mL final concentration) was added to each pellet  and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. 
Following incubation, cell suspensions were sonicat ed using a Sonic 300 dismembranator with an 59 
 intermediate tip and relative output of 60%. Sonica tion occurred for 10 times, 5 seconds each 
time, placing the cell suspension on ice in between  sonications to cool the cell suspension and 
ensure that the heat generated was not denaturing t he protein. The cell suspension was 
centrifuged (10,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4°C) to pellet  the cell debris. The protein-containing 
supernatant was stored at 4°C until further purific ation can occur and the pellet was discarded as 
bacterial waste. 
To purify the protein, the protein-containing super natant was applied to a nickel-
nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin slurry (Clon-T ech) in a 1:1 ratio of unpure protein to resin in 
a glass frit column (Kimble-Chase Flex Column). The  hexa-histidine tag on the induced AzoC 
protein allowed for AzoC to interact with the Ni 2+ of the resin and ultimately allowed for pure 
AzoC to be isolated from the other protein contamin ants. All purification steps occurred at 4°C to 
ensure that the protein did not denature. After app lying the protein-containing supernatant to the 
Ni-NTA resin slurry in the glass frit column, the m ixture was allowed to incubate horizontally on-
column for at least 1 hour at 4°C while shaking at medium speed on a BioDancer orbital shaker 
(New Brunswick Scientific). This incubation ensures  that AzoC in solution will interact with and 
bind to the Ni-NTA resin. Following this incubation , excess solution was drained from the 
column as the pre-wash fraction and the resin was w ashed with lysis/wash buffer until the 
effluent draining off of the column was clear (save d as wash fractions). After washing occurred, 
the pure protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA resin b y exposure of the resin to an elution buffer 
(20% glycerol, 50 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 75 0 mM sodium chloride, 250 mM 
imidazole, deionized water, pH 8.0). At least four elutions were carried out to ensure that all 
protein was eluted from the column. Elutions were s aved and stored frozen at -20°C until further 
analysis could occur. 
AzoC-containing elutions were analyzed via SDS-PAGE  gel.  SDS-PAGE gel analysis 
was performed as described previously (Laemmli, 197 0). AzoC-containing samples were 60 
 prepared for this analysis directly following their  purification by adding a 1X concentration of the 
SDS-PAGE loading buffer (4X loading buffer stock = 0.06 M TRIS-HCl pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) 
glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.0025% (w/v) bromophenol b lue). Beta-mercaptoethanol (5%) was 
used to denature disulfide bonds.  To ensure protein unfolding, samples were boiled fo r at least 15 
minutes prior to loading onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel (20 μL sample loaded per lane). 
Coomassie blue was used for SDS-PAGE gel staining a nd the AzoC-containing protein bands 
were visualized and photographed in comparison to a  250 kDa protein ladder (New England 
Biolabs). A Nanovue Spectrometer was utilized to de termine the protein concentration by use of 
the molar extinction coefficient of AzoC (0.880). T he molar extinction coefficient was obtained 
through the NCBI database. The protein was concentr ated between 2-10 mg/mL using an Amicon 
Ultrafiltration cell system (Nitrogen pressure and a NMWL 10,000 Millipore regenerated 
cellulose membrane). Protein was stored frozen at - 20°C when not in use.  
Oxidized NAD+ Assays 
 To test the specificity and function of the cofact ors, reduced NADH and oxidized NAD+ 
were tested. Because Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A se ems to have the most dramatic cofactor-
effect, it was the dye used in this study. The azo dye reaction with Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A 
was tested aerobically and anaerobically with NAD+ only, and the combination of NAD+ and 
FAD. These experiments were performed in the absenc e of any protein, including AzoC.   
pH Assays 
 In an effort to understand the physiological impor tance of the cofactor-only studies and 
the dependence of pH on the cofactor effect, the co factor reaction mixtures were tested at 
different pHs: pH 6.0 (potassium phosphate buffer),  pH 5.0 (sodium acetate buffer), pH 4.0 
(sodium acetate buffer), pH 3.0 (sodium citrate buf fer). Rumen fluid (pH ~8.5) was also tested 
and prepared for the experiments by spinning in a c entrifuge (10,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4°C) to 61 
 remove debris. These pH-dependent experiments were conducted as described above by only 
changing the pH of the buffer used . The azo dye reaction mixtures were tested both aero bically 
and anaerobically for all pH values in the same man ner as described previously.     
HPLC Analysis of Metabolites 
 In an effort to understand the relative identities  of the metabolites produced by the 
reaction with AzoC versus the reaction with the cof actors, the metabolites produced by both 
reactions were extracted and analyzed via HPLC and the metabolites spectra were compared.   
 Reactions were scaled up 10-fold in an effort to p roduce concentrated metabolites that 
were detectable with HPLC spectroscopy. Reactions w ere prepared aerobically and anaerobically 
either with the cofactors only (FAD/NADH) or with A zoC (1.44 mg) and cofactors 
(FAD/NADH). Reactions containing only the cofactors  were prepared to a 2 mL volume in a test 
tube with 25 mM dye (Direct Blue 15), 50 mM NADH, 1 0 mM FAD, 25 mM potassium 
phosphate buffer pH 7.0, and deionized water to the  desired volume. Anaerobic reactions were 
bubbled with nitrogen for twenty minutes at a bubbl e rate of one bubble per second and then 
overlaid with mineral oil. Reactions were incubated  at 37°C. Controls were prepared by heat-
denaturing both AzoC and cofactors. These control r eactions were set-up as described above 
following the heat-denaturation.   
After incubation, samples were extracted using thre e equal volumes of ethyl acetate 
(HPLC grade). Extractions were dried using sodium s ulfate and concentrated under a gentle 
stream of nitrogen and gentle heating. Solvent was exchanged to methanol for HPLC analysis. An 
extraction control was also prepared, using a sampl e containing only Direct Blue 15. Separation 
of the metabolites produced was accomplished by use  of an HPLC (Thermo Scientific) with an 
Alltima C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, Alltech). Meta bolites and retention times were 
determined by using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer set at 280 nm. A gradient elution was utilized 62 
 at 10% HPLC-grade methanol (90% reagent-grade water ) for 5 minutes, followed by 30% 
methanol for 5 minutes, 40% methanol for 5 minutes,  50% methanol for 5 minutes, 60% 
methanol for 5 minutes and 100% methanol for 20 min utes to flush the column. 10% methanol 
was held for 3 minutes prior to the injection of a new sample. Flow rate was set at 0.8 mL/min. 
Each sample (100 µL) was loaded onto the column, an d dilutions of the test sample were 
prepared in methanol if deemed necessary for the ac curate detection of metabolites. 
Mass Spectroscopy Analysis of Metabolites 
To determine the molecular weight of the dye metabo lites produced by both the 
azoreductase and the cofactors only, samples prepar ed as described above were analyzed by 
infusion of the sample, diluted in a 66:33 Methanol /water mixture, directly into an LTQ Orbitrap 
XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) via a New Objective nanospray ion source. MS 
spectra were collected at a nominal resolution of 1 00,000. Mass spectra were analyzed using 
Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific) and had a 5-10 ppm mas s accuracy.  
Results 
Dye Reduction Assays – AzoC and Cofactors 
AzoC shows high enzymatic activity with Direct Blue  15 as a substrate. As shown in 
Figure 17, AzoC reduces the dye completely over a p eriod of 15 minutes. When compared to its 
control (cofactors only), the dye reduction with Az oC is significantly greater (p-value <0.001, 
95% confidence). However, when looking at Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A, the dye reduction 
profile is almost identical between the azoreductas e and the cofactor only control (p-value >0.05, 
95% confidence). This suggests that, in this partic ular case, the dye reduction seen with Cibacron 
Brilliant Red 3B-A is not significantly different b etween the azoreductase and the cofactor-only 
control, suggesting that the cofactors are responsi ble for all dye reduction. This provides the basis 
for the study in this Chapter. 63 
  
Figure 17.  FAD and NADH Cofactors as Compared to AzoC. Reacti ons were performed with FAD and 
NADH in both the presence and absence of an azoredu ctase enzyme, AzoC, under anaerobic conditions and 
are compared for two different azo dyes (Direct Blu e 15 and Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A). Experimental  
conditions, including dye concentration, were consi stent. The percentage of dye remaining (% dye 
remaining) is plotted as a mean and the error bars represent standard deviation across triplicate (n=3 ) 
samples. Comparing the % dye reduced between Cibacr on Brilliant Red 3B-A, with and without AzoC, 
there is not a significant difference in dye reduct ion (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). However, with 
Direct Blue 15, the comparison of with and without AzoC shows a significant difference in dye reductio n 
(p-value <0.001, 95% confidence). 
 
Eleven azo dyes of varying characteristics (molecul ar weight, number of azo bonds, 
sulfonation) were tested (Figure 18). Single cofact or effects on dye reduction (FAD only, NADH 
only, etc) were not observed, as only a combination  of two different cofactors showed significant 
reduction (Figure 18). There is great diversity amo ngst the dyes when it comes to reduction by 
the varying cofactor combinations. Cibacron Brillia nt Red 3B-A was the best performing dye 
using the FAD/NADH and FMN/NADH combination as near ly 100% of the dye was reduced for 
both combinations. There was no specificity for dye  reduction based on the number of azo bonds, 
64 
 as seen with Direct Blue 15 (diazo) and Cibacron Br illiant Red 3B-A (monoazo) which had the 
highest degree of reduction (Figure 18). However, a n increase in dye reduction based on the 
increase in the molecular weight of the dyes was no ticed. Simple linear regressions were 
performed to assess the impact of molecular weight on dye reduction for each cofactor. For all of 
the cofactor combinations, there was a statistical significance between dye reduction and 
molecular weight at 95% confidence (FAD/NADH p-valu e=0.001, R 2=0.6618; FAD/NADPH p-
value=0.0495, R 2=0.1188; FMN/NADH p-value=0.001, R 2=0.6608; FMN/NADPH p-
value=0.001, R 2=0.3839); thus, in all cofactor combinations tested , the amount of dye reduction 
increased as the molecular weight of the dye increa sed.

error for triplicate samples (n=3). Letters (a,b,c)  represent comparisons of the different cofactor

different at a 95% confidence level. Dyes are shown  in increasing molecular weight from left to right.  (# = 
monoazo dye, * = diazo dye, N = non-sulfonated, S =  sulfonated) 
65 
 Four cofactor combinations were tested and each sho wed a high degree of diversity, as 
visualized by the letters above the bars in Figure 18. When comparing the flavin cofactor (FMN 
and FAD) and the same nicotinamide cofactor, a comp lex and varied degree of dye reduction 
occurred. In the cases of Eriochrome Black T and Tr ypan Blue, dye reduction is greater with 
FAD compared to FMN, a significant difference as re flected by the 95% confidence level. On the 
other hand, in the case of Congo Red, the dye reduc tion with FMN is significantly better than 
FAD at the 95% confidence level. For the combinatio n of FMN/NADPH compared to the 
combination of FAD/NADPH, dye reduction is signific antly better with FMN for Direct Blue 15 
and Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A, while dye reductio n is significantly better with FAD for 
Ponceau S at 95% confidence.   
When comparing the nicotinamide cofactors (NADH and  NADPH) to the same flavin 
cofactor, NADH combinations are consistently higher  than NADPH with the specific dyes tested, 
as seen in Figure 18. Specifically, the FMN/NADH co mbination is significantly higher (95% 
confidence) with Congo Red, Ponceau S, Trypan Blue,  Direct Blue 15 and Cibacron Brilliant Red 
3B-A. In contrast, the FAD/NADH combination is sign ificantly higher (95% confidence) with 
Eriochrome Black T, Ponceau BS, Trypan Blue, Direct  Blue 15 and Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A.   
Figure 19 examines the characteristics of the dyes,  cofactor choice and its preferred 
oxygen state (aerobic or anaerobic) for dye reducti on. There are two cases in which an oxygen-
rich environment was significantly more conducive t o dye reduction. For Ponceau BS 
(FMN/NADH) and Congo Red (FAD/NADH), the dye reduct ion occurred significantly better in 
the presence of oxygen than under anaerobic conditi ons (95% confidence). There are three cases 
in which an anaerobic environment was significantly  more conducive to larger dye reduction by 
the FAD/NADH cofactor combinations: Cibacron Brilli ant Red 3B-A, Direct Blue 15, and 
Trypan Blue. An opposite effect was seen with the i ntermediate size dyes (Congo Red and 
Ponceau BS) as an aerobic environment was significa ntly more ideal. However, the choice of 66 
 cofactor was different as Congo Red/ FAD and Poncea u BS/FMN were preferred. There was not 
a correlation between oxygen state and cofactor com bination, suggesting that the ability of the 
cofactors to reduce dye is not dependent on the oxy gen state. Finally, no preference for dye 
sulfonation occurred, as both aerobic and anaerobic  environments support dye reduction.

varying cofactor combinations (see key) with cofact ors only under both aerobic and anaerobic condition s. 
Experimental conditions, including dye concentratio n, were kept consistent. Error bars represent stand ard 
error for triplicate samples (n=3). Dyes are shown in increasing molecular weight from left to right. 
Asterisks (*) represent cases in which there is a s ignificant difference between the two bars (p-value  < 0.05, 
95% confidence).   
 
 
When the dye reduction produced by an azoreductase (AzoC)/cofactor combination is 
compared to the dye reduction produced by the cofac tors alone, it can be seen that the addition of 
AzoC increased the dye reduction of the larger dyes  (Congo Red, Ponceau S, Trypan Blue and 
Direct Blue 15) with FAD or FMN in combination with  NADH, as seen in Figure 20. The only 67 
 exception was Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A. Interest ingly, for Eriochrome Black T, a smaller dye, 
the addition of AzoC resulted in a decrease in dye reduction for FAD/NADH, which was 
significant at a 95% confidence level.  
In some cases, dye reduction by the cofactors is no t significantly different than the dye 
reduction produced by the azoreductase, such as the  case with both the FMN/NADH combination 
(Methyl Orange, Methyl Red, Tartrazine, Eriochrome Black T, Janus Green and Cibacron 
Brilliant Red 3B-A) and FAD/NADH combination (Methy l Orange, Methyl Red, Tartrazine, 
Janus Green, Ponceau BS and Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A). In these cases, the fact that the 
azoreductase is not reducing the azo dye significan tly better than the cofactors themselves 
suggests that all or most of the dye reduction that  we are seeing with the azoreductase is due to 
the presence of the cofactors.  
All of the four largest dyes (not including Cibacro n Brilliant Red 3B-A) do not show a 
preference for cofactor combination. However, this does not hold for the next heaviest dye, 
Ponceau BS, as the azoreductase in this case seems to favor FMN. There is not a correlation 
between number of azo bonds and dye reduction by az oreductase and/or cofactors (Figure 20). 
All of the cases where the dye reduction by the azo reductase was significantly higher than the 
cofactors the dyes were sulfonated. The exception w as Eriochrome Black T (sulfonated), which 
was reduced significantly more by the cofactors alo ne. Ultimately, some dyes were not 
significantly reduced under any experimental condit ions, with or without cofactors or 
azoreductase, including Methyl Red, Methyl Orange a nd Tartrazine. 68

with varying cofactor combinations (see key) with c ofactors only under anaerobic conditions with and 
without AzoC. Experimental conditions, including dy e concentration, were kept consistent. Error bars 
represent standard error for triplicate samples (n= 3). Dyes are shown in increasing molecular weight f rom 
left to right.  Asterisks (*) represent cases in wh ich there is a significant difference between the t wo bars (p-
value < 0.05, 95% confidence).   
 
NAD+ Assays 
 The importance of a reduced form (NADH) of the cof actor, without AzoC, in dye 
reduction was shown compared to the oxidized (NAD+)  form (Figure 21). When NADH and 
NAD+ are acting alone with Cibacron Brilliant Red 3 B-A, both aerobically and anaerobically, no 
dye reduction is produced. However, when comparing the NADH/FAD combination to the 
NAD+/FAD combination, the difference is significant  to a 95% confidence (p-value <0.001). 
Aerobically, NADH/FAD reduces 18-fold greater dye t han NAD+/FAD. The difference in 69 
 reduction is greater anaerobically, where NADH/FAD reduces 22-fold greater dye than 
NAD+/FAD, suggesting the possible inhibition of oxy gen.

with varying cofactor combinations (see key) with c ofactors only under anaerobic conditions with and 
without FAD. Experimental conditions, including dye  concentration, were kept consistent. Error bars 
represent the standard error for triplicate samples  (n=3).   
 
pH Assays 
 To further evaluate the differences between NADPH and NADH, pH was studied as a 
variable using Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A (Figure 22). For the cofactor combination of 
FAD/NADH, both aerobically and anaerobically, an op timal pH for this cofactor effect was not 
found, as differences between the different pH valu es tested are not significant to 95% 
confidence. For the cofactor combination of FAD/NAD PH, lower pH values tend to be favored, 
especially aerobically, as the dye reduction at pH 3 is significantly higher (at 95% confidence) 
70 
 than at the other pH values tested. For the cofacto r combination of FMN/NADH, both aerobically 
and anaerobically an optimal pH for this cofactor e ffect was not found, as differences between the 
different pH values tested are not significant to a  95% confidence level. For the cofactor 
combination of FMN/NADPH, lower pH values tend to b e favored, as the dye is reduced 
significantly better (to a 95% confidence level) at  a decreased pH. Overall, more dye is reduced 
with a flavin cofactor and NADH than with a flavin cofactor and NADPH, both aerobically and 
anaerobically between pH 8.5 and 4.0. However, as p H decreases to 3, the amount of dye reduced 
by a flavin cofactor and NADPH is higher than the f lavin cofactor with NADH.

error for triplicate samples (n=3). Letters represe nt comparisons of the different cofactor combinatio ns

 Analysis of Metabolites 
 To determine if the decolorization of the dye by t he cofactors results in the generation of 
metabolites similar to an AzoC reaction, the metabo lites produced by the cofactor reaction were 
compared to the metabolites produced by the azoredu ctase reaction. Figure 23 shows the expected 
metabolites from the reduction of Direct Blue 15, a  dye that was more readily reduced.

calculated based on molecular formula of metabolite s. [M+H]+ represents the monoisotopic mass with the  
addition of one proton and [M-H]- represents the mo noisotopic mass with the subtraction of one proton.  
 
HPLC analysis showed that each sample separated int o two distinct peaks, the column 
retention times of which are shown in Table 6.  The  similarity in the retention times suggests the 
metabolites for the azoreductase and cofactor are t he same.

Mass spectroscopy analysis of the dye metabolites i s shown in Figure 24. In all of the 
conditions tested, the mass spectra are consistent with the 3,3’-dimethoxybenzidine metabolite 
being present in the [M+H]+ form (monoisotopic mass  245.128 m/z). The other metabolite at 
377.956 m/z was not able to be seen in any of the m ass spectra, however, this may be due to 
improper ionization conditions for that particular compound.   
Discussion 
The goal of this paper was to provide a comprehensi ve study of the effect of NADH, 
NADPH, FMN and FAD on the reduction of azo dyes bot h aerobically and anaerobically as 
compared to the reduction of dyes seen with an azor eductase. In Chapter 2, it was noted that, the 
cofactors necessary for AzoC to function were able to reduce azo dyes in the absence of AzoC.   
A significant amount of diversity was noted amongst  the cofactor-mediated reduction of 
the eleven diverse azo dyes tested. There does not appear to be a correlation between the number 
of azo bonds or sulfonation and the ability of the azo dye to be reduced by the all cofactors, as 
can be seen by the lack of an apparent correlation in Figure 18. However, there is a statistically 
significant correlation between the molecular weigh t of the dye and reduction , as larger dyes 
were more readily reduced compared to smaller dyes (95% confidence level). This correlation 
will need to be further examined with a larger samp le set of dyes to confirm whether this 
correlation is relevant or if it is an artifact of the particular dyes tested. 73

 In all, four cofactor combinations were tested, as well as all of the cofactors alone. None 
of the cofactors alone were able to reduce the azo dyes, however, when in combination, dye 
reduction was significant (95% confidence level). T he combination of a flavin cofactor with 
NADH consistently reduces azo dyes better than the same flavin cofactor with NADPH (Figure 
18). Regarding the flavin cofactors, a varied outco me for dye reduction occurred. First, there is a 
significant outcome (95% confidence level) that sho ws that combinations with FMN favor larger 
dyes. In contrast, for FAD there is a preference fo r both smaller dyes as well as larger dyes. 
Figure 18 also provides an interesting finding rega rding the degree of complete dye reduction as 
most dyes were not completely reduced by the cofact ors alone, while only Cibacron Brilliant Red 
3B-A was completely reduced. It is known that NADP( H) binds to redox proteins and controls 
the redox potential of flavin cofactors (Murataliev  & Feyereisen, 2000). Therefore, it is likely that 
the redox potential changes that occur for each fla vin cofactor are different, resulting in different 
redox differences for different azo dyes. Clinicall y, elevated cellular NADH levels have been 
shown to be associated with ethanol consumption (al coholic liver disease) and diabetes 
(glomerular dysfunction) (Hagymasi  et al , 2001; Ido  et al , 1997; Seronello  et al , 2010; Sorrell & 
Tuma, 1985; Tilton  et al , 1992). It is possible that such an increased amou nt of cofactor in such 
an environment could be favorable for the generatio n of carcinogenic metabolites in these 
patients and is thus of clinical interest. 
There was not a significant correlation between oxy gen state and cofactor combination in 
terms of dye reduction, but there were significant differences between cofactors and oxygen 
states. Most dyes were reduced under anaerobic stat es with either flavin cofactor (95% 
confidence level) (Figure 19). The two exceptions w ere Congo Red and Ponceau BS, in which the 
former preferred an aerobic FAD combination and the  latter preferred an aerobic FMN 
combination. This difference in oxygen state for dy e reduction suggests that the dyes that prefer 
anaerobic conditions may be more readily affected b y changes in oxygen levels. In addition, 75 
 larger molecular weight dyes seem to have a prefere nce for anaerobic environments compared to 
moderate and small size dyes, suggesting oxygen cha nges the oxidation state of the larger dyes 
more readily thereby allowing reduction of the dye.  Additionally, while the azoreduction reaction 
under aerobic conditions has the possibility of pro ducing superoxide via semi-quinone radicals 
formed with the reduction of some azo dyes, this is  not expected to occur in the absence of 
oxygen such as how AzoC was tested (Moller & Wallin , 2000).  
The effect of added azoreductase to the cofactor co mbinations was significant (95% 
confidence level) in some cases (Figure 20). In the  case of Methyl Orange, Methyl Red, 
Tartrazine, Janus Green and Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A, dye reduction with AzoC was not 
significantly different than the dye reduction seen  with the cofactors alone (95% confidence 
level). This suggests that, for these particular dy es, the dye reduction is originating from the 
cofactors alone, or that AzoC may not be able to re duce these dyes. Enzyme specificity is also 
important as the larger dye (Cibacron Brilliant Red  3B-A) may not specifically bind to 
azoreductase. For Eriochrome Black T, it was noted that dye reduction with the cofactors alone 
was significantly better than that with the azoredu ctase. Eriochrome Black T has a unique 
structural characteristic in that it contains two f used-rings which are adjacent to the azo bond 
(Figure 4), which may allow AzoC more structural in hibition compared to the other nonfused-
ring dyes and suggests that steric constraints may restrict the breakdown of the azo bond by the 
azoreductase but not by the cofactors. All of the a zo dyes which were reduced significantly better 
by the azoreductase (95% confidence level) were lar ge molecular weight dyes, which may 
suggest these dyes are better suited to have a bind ing pocket in the azoreductase than the smaller 
azo dyes.   
It is hypothesized that reduction potential will pl ay a role in the likelihood of the azo dye 
to be reduced, as azo dyes are reduced by oxidation -reduction reactions (Chung & Stevens, 
1993). It is thought that if the reduction potentia l of the various azo dyes were more positive than 76 
 that of the flavin cofactor, electrons could be tra nsferred from the nicotinamide cofactor (E 0’= -
0.320V) to the flavin cofactor (E 0’= -0.219V) and to the azo dye (E 0’ > -0.219V) which will be 
reduced (Zille  et al , 2004). Literature have shown that this is true fo r reactions involving an 
azoreductase, so it is likely the same for non-enzy matic reaction involving the cofactors since a 
transfer of electrons is taking place (Zille  et al , 2004). This will need to be investigated further to 
confirm that dye reduction potential does in fact s how a correlation to the ability of the dye to be 
reduced by the cofactors. 
The effects of pH changes on dye reduction were com plex as various degrees of dye 
reduction occurred based on cofactors and oxygen st ates (Figure 22). What we did observe in 
terms of significance (95% confidence level) was ea ch reaction set (i.e. cofactor combination and 
oxygen state) shows the low performing NADPH having  more reduction at lower pHs (3-4) than 
higher pHs (7, 8.5). The rumen fluid (pH 8.5) may h ave contributed other factors which are 
difficult to account for that have resulted in an i ncrease in reduction in some cases. For NADH, 
there were less differences seen between the basic and acidic conditions, as in some cases the 
results at pH 3 were not significantly different th an those at pH 7. These observations are 
physiologically relevant, as azoreduction in the hu man body tends to occur in the ileum and colon 
of the intestinal tract where pH values of these re gions ranges from 4-7 (Fallingborg, 1999; 
Wright, 2007). This suggests that dye reduction wit hin the intestines may be by cofactors as well 
as azoreductases, with NADH reducing at both high a nd low pH values and NADPH reducing at 
decreased pH values. It is possible that the intera ctions between the excess phosphate group in 
NADPH may be helping or hindering the interactions between the nicotinamide cofactor and the 
azo dye. There is great diversity in the literature  as to whether NADH or NADPH are preferred 
electron donors; in many cases, both NADH and NADPH  work (Ghosh  et al , 1992; Huang  et al , 
1979; Idaka  et al , 1987; Wang  et al , 2007; Zimmermann  et al , 1982). Also, it should be noted that 
a reduced form of the nicotinamide cofactor is nece ssary for dye reduction to occur (Figure 21). 77 
 This is as expected, as when NADH is present in its  oxidized state (NAD+), the proper electron 
flow cannot occur and therefore dye reduction does not occur (Figure 21).   
The cofactors were found to produce the same dye me tabolites as the azoreductase, as 
shown by HPLC and MS analytical studies, which sugg ests that dye reduction occurs by the same 
type of oxidation-reduction reaction, causing the b reakdown of the azo bond. The presence of the 
3,3’-dimethoxybenzidine metabolite conclusively sho ws that, in all conditions tested, both of the 
azo bonds of Direct Blue 15 have been broken. The o utcome of our results suggests the 
importance of having a cofactor-only control within  azoreductase studies as the azo bond can be 
reduced without the azoreductase, and the metabolit es generated are identical to what is observed 
with enzyme reduced dye metabolism (Table 6 and Fig ure 24).      
The goal of this Chapter was to offer an inclusive study of the effect of redox cofactors 
on the reduction of azo dyes under varying oxygen s tates as compared to an azoreductase 
reaction. In conclusion, the results showed that co mbinations of cofactors (a nicotinamide 
cofactor plus a flavin cofactor) are able to non-en zymatically reduce azo dyes by breakage of the 
azo bond under both aerobic and anaerobic condition s and at physiologically-relevant pH values. 
When compared to an azoreductase, this non-enzymati c reduction was found to be equal to 
azoreductase activity in some cases, suggesting the  importance of cofactor-only reactions 
occurring for in vitro conditions. It is thought that this non-enzymatic r eaction undergoes 
reduction potential changes for the dyes and cofact ors. To our knowledge, this is the first study 
which provides a comprehensive look at the effect o f NADH, NADPH, FMN and FAD on the 
reduction of azo dyes both aerobically and anaerobi cally as compared to an azoreductase.

 CHAPTER IV 
 
 
STRUCTURE AND STABILITY OF AN AZOREDUCTASE WITH AN FAD COFACTOR 
FROM THE STRICT ANAEROBE CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS 
The following chapter is based off of a publication  in the journal Protein and Peptide Letters 
(2014, 21 :523-534) and appears here with the journal’s permi ssion. 
Abstract  
Azoreductase enzymes present in many microorganisms  exhibit the ability to reduce azo 
dyes, an abundant industrial pollutant, to produce carcinogenic metabolites that threaten human 
health. All biochemically-characterized azoreductas es, around 30 to date, have been isolated from 
aerobic bacteria, except for AzoC, the azoreductase  of Clostridium perfringens, which is from a 
strictly anaerobic bacterium. AzoC is a recently bi ochemically-characterized azoreductase. The 
lack of structural information on AzoC hinders the mechanistic understanding of this enzyme. In 
this Chapter, the biophysical characterization of t he structure and thermal stability of AzoC by 
using a wide range of biophysical tools is reported : Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 
(LC-MS), Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy, Fourier-t ransform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, 
SDS-PAGE, Size Exclusion Chromatography, MALDI-TOF and UV-visible spectroscopy. It was 
found that the flavin cofactor of AzoC is FAD, whil e all other structurally-known azoreductases 
employ FMN as a cofactor. The secondary structure o f AzoC has 16% less α-helix structures, 5% 
more β-sheet structures and 11% more turn and unord ered than the average of structurally-known 79 
 azoreductase that has 10-14% sequence similarities with AzoC. It was also found that oxidized 
AzoC is trimeric, which is unique amongst structura lly known azoreductases. In contrast, reduced 
AzoC is monomeric, despite similarities in catalyti c activity and thermal stability of oxidized and 
reduced AzoC. These results show that the use of FT IR spectroscopy is crucial for 
characterization of the β-sheet content in AzoC, il lustrating the need for complementary 
biophysical tools for secondary structural characte rization of proteins. 
Introduction  
 Azo dyes are used extensively in industry, includi ng pharmaceuticals, textiles, foods, 
beverages and cosmetic products (Chen  et al , 2009). From the 700,000 tons of azo dyes used 
annually, 35,000 to 70,000 tons of them are dischar ged into the environment as pollutants (Chen  
et al , 2009). Azoreductase enzymes present in many micro organisms exhibit the ability to reduce 
azo dyes to produce carcinogenic metabolites that t hreaten human health (Priya  et al , 2011). In 
Chapter 2, AzoC, an azoreductase from the strictly anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium perfringens , 
was isolated and biochemically characterized  (Morrison et al,  2012).  It was found in Chapter 2 
that this azoreductase has strong and enzymatic spe cific activity with an azo dye substrate (0.27 
µmoles Direct Blue 15/min/mg AzoC) (Morrison  et al , 2012). The rate of dye decolorization, 
along with Km and Vmax values (Km = 5 nM, Vmax = 0. 42 µM dye/min/mg protein), is 
comparable to aerobic azoreductases in the literatu re, suggesting that AzoC is a strong and 
specific azoreductase (Morrison  et al , 2012). Of the approximately 30 azoreductases that  have 
been biochemically characterized, AzoC is the only one originating from a strictly anaerobic 
bacterium.   
Azoreductases require cofactors for their catalytic  function in an oxidation-reduction 
reaction. All azoreductases require a nicotinamide cofactor (NADH or NADPH) and most of 
them also preferentially and selectively utilize a flavin cofactor (FAD or FMN) (Abraham & 80 
 John, 2007; Ooi  et al , 2012). Due to the inherent appearance of yellow c olor and the necessity for 
additional flavin cofactor for enzyme activity, Azo C has been shown to be a flavoprotein 
(Morrison  et al , 2012). However, the identity of the flavin cofact or of AzoC remains unknown. A 
method is reported in this Chapter for rapid and ac curate determination of the flavin cofactor of 
an azoreductase. 
To date, all information available on azoreductase structure originates from aerobic 
bacteria; there is no structural information availa ble from azoreductases isolated from strictly 
anaerobic bacteria (Correia  et al , 2011; Filippova  et al , 2010; Ito  et al , 2006; Liu  et al , 2007; Tan  
et al , 2012; Wang  et al , 2007). With three-dimensional structures of five azoreductases known, 
azoreductases from aerobic microorganisms show sign ificant structural similarity, specifically 
amongst those bacteria found in the human intestine  (Ito  et al , 2008). Also, while amongst 
aerobic azoreductases sequence similarity is low, a zoreductases share structural topology and 
similarity which make the enzymes behave in a simil ar manner (Liu  et al , 2007). Because 
Clostridium perfringens  is also an inhabitant of the intestine, AzoC may b e structurally similar to 
the aerobic azoreductases, even if it may not be si milar in protein sequence. Based on these facts, 
it is expected that AzoC will show structural simil arity to aerobic azoreductases, which will be 
tested experimentally in this proposal. Fourier Tra nsform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and 
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy are establishe d techniques for the elucidation of a protein's 
secondary structure (Arrondo  et al , 1993; Kelly & Price, 2000). The combined use of F TIR and 
CD spectroscopic approaches to study the enzyme’s s econdary structure is used for the first time 
here. Because very little is known about anaerobic azoreductases, the information provided by the 
secondary structure of an anaerobic azoreductase wo uld represent a step forward in the field and 
would provide an understanding of the similarities and differences between the structures of 
aerobic and anaerobic azoreductases. The use of bio physical methods to characterize the AzoC 81 
 enzyme, to determine the identity of the cofactor o f AzoC, and to determine the multimeric state 
and thermal stability of AzoC are also reported in this Chapter. 
Materials and Methods 
Sample Preparation 
NovaBlue (DE3) E. coli  cells harboring the AzoC-containing plasmid (with Histidine-tag 
and IPTG-triggered induction) were prepared by Cris tee Wright (see Chapter 2) (Morrison  et al , 
2012; Wright, 2007). These E. coli  cells were inoculated into a 5 mL LB broth and gro wn 
overnight at 37°C with orbital shaking at 200 rpm. The 5 mL LB broth also contained ampicillin 
(100 µg/mL final concentration) to select for the A zoC-plasmid containing E. coli  cells. 
Following overnight growth, this 5 mL culture was t ransferred to a 1 L LB broth (containing 100 
µg/mL ampicillin) and incubated at 37°C with orbita l shaking at 200 rpm until an optical density 
of 0.6 (OD 600  = 0.6) was reached. Upon reaching the desired opti cal density, the E. coli culture 
was induced with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyrano side (IPTG, 1 mM final concentration) for 
at least 3 hours with incubation at 37°C and orbita l shaking at 200 rpm. Following the IPTG-
triggered induction, cells were pelleted by centrif ugation (6,000 x g, 10 minutes, 4°C). The 
supernatant was discarded as bacterial waste and th e cell pellet was stored frozen (-20°C) until 
further purification steps could be taken. 
To rescue the induced AzoC from the E. coli cells, the cell pellet from the previous step 
was thawed and resuspended in 10 mL of lysis/wash b uffer (20% glycerol, 50 mM sodium 
monobasic phosphate, 750 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM imidazole, deionized water, pH 8.0). To 
lyse the cells, lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL final concentra tion) was added to the cell suspensions and 
suspensions were incubated for 30 minutes on ice. F ollowing this incubation, cells were lysed by 
sonication by using an intermediate tip on a Sonic 300 dismembranator with a relative output of 
60%. Ten sonication cycles occurred, with 5 seconds  in each cycle. To ensure that the released 82 
 protein did not denature due to the increased tempe rature caused by the sonication procedure, the 
cell suspension was placed on ice in between sonica tion cycles. To pellet the cell debris and 
separate out the protein-containing supernantant, t he cell suspension was centrifuged (10,000 x g, 
30 minutes, 4°C).  The supernatant containing the p rotein was stored at 4°C until further 
purification could occur. The pellet was discarded as bacterial waste. 
The protein-containing supernatant from the previou s step was applied to a nickel-
nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin slurry (Clon-Tech ) housed in a glass frit column (Kimble-Chase 
Flex Column). The hexa-histidine tag on AzoC allows  for the protein to interact with the Ni 2+ 
resin and allows for contaminants to be washed from  the column and is ultimately what allows for 
AzoC to be purified. All protein purification steps  occurred at 4°C to make sure that the protein 
did not denature during the process. Once the prote in-containing supernatant was mixed with the 
Ni-NTA resin in the column, the mixture in the colu mn was allowed to incubate for at least 1 
hour at 4°C while orbitally shaking at medium speed  on a BioDancer orbital shaker (New 
Brunswick Scientific). This incubation allows the H istidine-tag of AzoC adequate time to interact 
with and bind to the Ni 2+ of the Ni-NTA resin. Following incubation, excess s upernatant was 
drained from the column as the pre-wash fraction. T he resin was then washed with lysis/wash 
buffer on column until the effluent leaving the col umn was clear (these washes were saved as 
wash fractions). After washing, the pure AzoC was e luted from the Ni-NTA column by exposing 
the resin to an elution buffer (20% glycerol, 50 mM  sodium monobasic phosphate, 750 mM 
sodium chloride, 250 mM imidazole, deionized water,  pH 8.0). A minimum of four elutions were 
completed to ensure that all protein was eluted fro m the column. The elutions were saved and 
stored frozen (-20°C) until they could be further a nalyzed. 
SDS-PAGE (see detailed procedure below) was used to  analyze the purity of the 
proteinaceous elutions and a Nanovue Spectrophotome ter (GE Life Sciences) was utilized to 
determine the protein concentration by use of the m olar extinction coefficient of AzoC (0.880). 83 
 The molar extinction coefficient was determined thr ough use of the NCBI database. Protein 
concentration and buffer switching was completed by  use of an Amicon Ultrafiltration cell under 
Nitrogen pressure and a Millipore regenerated cellu lose membrane (NMWL 10,000) for large 
volumes, Amicon Ultra 15 filter (NMWL 10,000) for m edium-sized volumes by centrifugation 
and Amicon Ultra 0.5 filter (NMWL 10,000) for small  volumes by centrifugation. Protein was 
stored at -20 °C when not being actively used and o therwise kept in an ice bath. Throughout 
experiments, buffers were kept as consistent as pos sible in order to minimize any buffer-related 
effects on AzoC. 
For liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) , protein prior to cofactor 
extraction was concentrated to 10 mg/mL in 50 mM po tassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). For 
CD spectroscopy, AzoC was concentrated to 0.8 mg/mL  in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer 
(pH 7.5). For FTIR spectroscopy (both secondary str ucture and thermal stability studies), AzoC 
was prepared to a concentration of 10 mg/mL in 50 m M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) in 
D2O. D 2O was used to minimize H 2O absorption in the Amide I region. For MALDI-TOF 
spectroscopy, AzoC was prepared to a concentration of 10 mg/mL in 20 mM TRIS (pH 7.5) and 
10 mM NaCl buffer. For size exclusion chromatograph y, protein was concentrated to 10 mg/mL 
in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).   
Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy 
 For LC-MS, protein samples were prepared by heat d enaturing 10 mg/mL AzoC in 
deionized water. Heat denaturation of AzoC occurred  for 1 hour at 100°C to release the cofactor. 
The denatured protein was removed by pelleting and with an Amicon Ultra 15 (NMWL 10,000). 
A 0.45 µm filter was used to remove any particulate  matter. Rescued cofactor was concentrated 
under a gentle stream of Nitrogen and gentle heatin g.   84 
 FMN (Sigma-Aldrich) and FAD (TCI America) standards  were prepared in deionized 
water to 1 mM concentration. All measurements were performed in an LCMS 2010 EV 
(Shimadzu). The stationary phase of the LC was Shim adzu Premier C 18  3 μm 4.6 mm × 100 mm; 
the mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and wate r at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Each 
measurement was performed with 5 μl sample injectio n. The sample was eluted with 50% 
methanol for 5 min, followed by an increase in the methanol concentration from 50% to 95% 
within 2 min. Finally, 95% methanol was used as the  mobile phase until the measurement was 
finished. All elutions from the LC were analyzed by  a mass spectrometer with an electrospray 
ionizer combined with a single quadrupole analyzer.  All negatively charged molecules within a 
50 to 1000 m/z range were detected using scanning m ode. 
Far-UV Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy 
CD spectra were collected using a Jasco J-815 CD sp ectrometer. Spectra were collected 
at 20 °C in the far-UV range (260-190 nm) using a s tep mode of 0.2 nm, bandwidth of 1.00 nm 
and a 50 nm/minute scan rate. Quartz cuvettes with a 1 mm pathlength were used. For secondary 
structure determination, an average of three scans was obtained for each spectrum at 20 ˚C. 
Solvent spectra were also obtained under the same c onditions and were subtracted from the 
sample spectra. Thermal unfolding was followed by m onitoring the ellipticity at 208 nm and 222 
nm from 20°C to 90°C at a temperature ramp of 15°C/ hour. 
The spectra were converted to mean residue elliptic ity (AzoC molecular mass of 25,070 
Da, 228 amino acids) and the secondary structural c ontent was deconvoluted using the online 
server Dichroweb with the SP175 reference data set and the CDSSTR algorithm (Compton & 
Johnson, 1986; Lees  et al , 2006; Whitmore & Wallace, 2004). Thermal unfoldin g analysis data 
were plotted using the Matlab program (unfoldprotei n.m), which uses a Savitsky-Golay filter 
(least squares polynomial regression) to smooth the  denaturation profile and to minimize the error 85 
 due to baseline correction (White). The maximum of the first derivative corresponds to the 
melting temperature (John & Weeks, 2000; Kelly  et al , 2005; Mergny & Lacroix, 2003).  
FTIR Spectroscopy 
 Single beam spectra of AzoC and buffer were measur ed using Bruker IFS 66v FTIR 
spectrometer with a rapid-scan option at 4 cm -1 spectral resolution. A 9-reflection diamond 
attenuated total reflection (ATR) cell (DuraSampl IR  II from Sens IR  Technologies, LLC) with 
temperature control was employed for this study. Th e temperature of the sample was regulated 
using a circulating unit (RTE-111 from NESLAB). The  AzoC sample was first thermally 
stabilized at 20ºC for 30 minutes prior to data col lection. The rapid-scan mirror velocity of 200 
kHz (6.330 cm/s) was used to increase the speed of data collection by 10-fold as compared to the 
normal mirror velocity. The single beam FTIR spectr a were collected in the mid-infrared spectral 
region from 800 cm -1 to 4000 cm -1 with 1024 scans each and six repeated measurements  for 
signal averaging at each temperature from 20ºC to 9 0ºC with 10ºC intervals. The rate of 
temperature ramp from 20°C to 90°C was strictly con trolled at 10ºC/15 minutes for both AzoC 
and buffer.  
All infrared absorption spectra of AzoC and potassi um phosphate buffer were calculated 
from single beam spectra with the empty diamond ATR  cell as reference. After averaging over 
six repeated measurements with a total of 6144 scan s, the resulting statistical noise in the Amide I 
region is less than 0.063 mOD, far smaller than the  infrared absorption signals in Amide I (~80 
mOD). The infrared spectra from the AzoC protein we re calculated by subtracting the buffer 
spectra in the corresponding temperature measured i n the same manner as the protein spectra. To 
compare the spectral shapes of AzoC, Amide I bands were normalized by the total band area. 
Small contamination of water vapor signals was remo ved by subtracting the pure water vapor 86 
 spectra. The secondary derivative spectra of infrar ed absorption were computed with smoothing 
over 13 points of data.  
SDS-PAGE  
SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as described previo usly (Laemmli, 1970). Before 
SDS-PAGE analysis, 15 µL of a purified protein samp le (~10 mg/mL) was mixed with 5 µL of 
SDS-PAGE loading buffer, which consists of 0.06 M T RIS-HCl pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% 
(w/v) SDS, 0.0025% (w/v) bromophenol blue, to the p rotein. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine 
(TCEP) was added as a reducing agent to reduce disu lfide bonds at a concentration of 20 mM to 
one sample for reduced AzoC, whereas deionized wate r was added to the same volume of another 
purified AzoC sample for oxidized AzoC (Gray, 1993) . TCEP was used for this study instead of 
the more common beta-mercaptoethanol because TCEP d oes not contain sulfur atoms which 
cause FTIR interference in regions of interest to t his study. In addition, both AzoC samples were 
boiled for 15 minutes to denature. Each denatured A zoC protein sample (20 μL) was loaded onto 
a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Coomassie blue was used for s taining and the protein bands for reduced 
and oxidized AzoC were visualized and photographed in comparison to a 250 kDa protein ladder 
(New England Biolabs). 
MALDI-TOF Spectroscopy 
To determine molecular weight of AzoC samples, puri fied protein sample was mixed 
with sinapinic acid solution. The size of the prote in was measured using the linear mode in an 
Applied Biosystem DE-PRO MALDI-TOF Mass Spectromete r. The instrument was calibrated by 
external standards, apo-myoglobin and bovine serum albumin. Sensitivity of the measurement 
was ± 50 D.

 Enzyme Activity Studies 
 An enzyme activity study to determine the differen ces in enzymatic specific activity 
between the reduced and oxidized AzoC was carried o ut as follows. Enzyme runs were carried 
out in 1.5 mL polystyrene cuvettes (Sigma-Aldrich) in triplicate with a total reaction volume of 1 
mL. Reaction components (with the exception of the cofactors) were mixed together prior to the 
initiation of the reaction and included 25 mM TRIS (pH 9.0) buffer, 20 µM Direct Blue 15, 
purified AzoC (144 µg) and deionized water to make the total reaction volume. In the oxidized 
assay, AzoC was used as is, but in the reduced case , the AzoC sample was reduced with 1 mM 
TCEP. To prepare an anaerobic system, the cuvette w as bubbled with nitrogen for 10 minutes at a 
bubble rate of 1 bubble per second. Following bubbl ing, the system was immediately overlaid 
with mineral oil. To begin the enzymatic reaction, 10 mM NADH and 2 mM FAD (which were 
premixed together) were added carefully to prevent the introduction of oxygen to the system and 
quickly mixed with an inoculating loop. The reactio n was scanned at room temperature using a 
UV-1650 PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) at 602.5 nm . Direct Blue 15 was scanned prior to 
this reaction and its optimal absorbance was determ ined to be at 602.5 nm. Direct Blue 15 
concentration was interpolated from its absorbance by making a standard curve of dye 
concentration to determine the extinction coefficie nt of Direct Blue 15. This is a 
spectrophotometer-specific equation of a best fit l ine. This data was utilized to calculate specific 
activity values for the oxidized and reduced AzoC s amples with Direct Blue 15. 
Size Exclusion Chromatography 
A standard curve of protein molecular weight marker s (Gel Filtration Standard #151-
1901, Bio-Rad) was used to calibrate a size exclusi on chromatography (SEC) column (Kostanski  
et al , 2004; Lemaire  et al , 1989; Morl, 1981; Striegel  et al , 2009). In addition, the protein 
standard was supplemented with Bovine Serum Albumin  (BSA) as an additional standard (MP 88 
 Biomedicals, 5.0 mg). The SEC column (1 m x 1 cm, K ontes FlexColumn) was loaded with Bio-
Gel P100 resin (Bio-Rad). Flow rate through the col umn was controlled by using a Microperpex 
Peristaltic Pump (LKB) set to a speed of 99, which resulted in a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. 
Fractions were collected with a ISCO automatic frac tion collector set to change collection tubes 
(13 x 100 mm borosilicate glass disposable culture tubes, Fisher Scientific) every 10 minutes, 
resulting in 5.0 mL fraction volume per tube. The f raction collector was started immediately as 
0.5 mL of each protein sample (both standard and un knowns) was put onto the column. Data was 
collected by measuring the absorbance of each fract ion in a UV-1650 PC spectrophotometer 
(Shimadzu) at 280 nm.   
 To determine the multimeric nature of reduced AzoC  with non-covalent interactions, size 
exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed. For r educed AzoC, the concentrated protein 
sample was treated with 1mM TCEP prior to loading o n the column. For oxidized AzoC, the 
protein sample was treated with the same amount of deionized water. Samples were loaded on the 
column and analyzed as described above. 
The elution volume of thyroglobulin was used to cal culate void volume (V 0). Protein 
samples (standards and unknowns) left the column in  multiple subsequent fractions, therefore the 
weighted average of elution volume (V e), based on sample absorbance at 280 nm, and were u sed. 
Weighted protein standard values were used to creat e a standard curve. The elution volumes of 
the standards (V e) were divided by the elution volume of thyroglobul in (V 0) to obtain V e/V 0, 
which is plotted against the log of the protein sta ndards’ molecular weights. 
The SEC data from the standard proteins were fit to  a straight line, Log 10 MW = -
0.280·(V e/V 0)+2.740 , using non-linear least squares fitting (PSI-Plot) . Based on the experimental 
Ve/V 0 values of reduced and oxidized AzoC, their molecul ar weights were estimated by use of the 89 
 linear equation of the Log 10 MW versus V e/V 0. The errors on the molecular weight of reduced and  
oxidized AzoC were calculated based on 95% of confi dence (PSI-Plot). 
UV-Visible Spectroscopy 
 A sample of AzoC in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffe r (pH 7.5) was scanned from 
300-500 nm using a Shimadzu UV-1601PC UV/Visible Sp ectrophotometer using a quartz cuvette 
(Shimadzu Corporation). The absorption maxima at 45 0 nm is due to the presence of FAD in the 
molecule and 11300 M -1cm -1 was used as the literature value for the bound ext inction coefficient 
of FAD (Axley  et al , 1997). Peak absorbance at 450 nm was converted to  a molarity value for 
FAD using the specified extinction coefficients and  path length of the instrument (1 cm). Because 
FAD also absorbs in the 280 nm range (where protein  concentration would be determined), a 
standard of the same molarity that was determined f or FAD was used as a blank to measure 
protein concentration in a way such that all absorb ance at 280 nm due to FAD was subtracted and 
the true absorbance due to protein could be determi ned. The extinction coefficient for AzoC was 
calculated using the full AzoC sequence at the Prot Param tool at the ExPASy website 
(http://web.expasy.org/protparam/) to be 19940 M -1cm -1 and a molarity value for AzoC was 
calculated (Wilkins  et al , 1999). The molar value of AzoC was compared to th e molar value of 
FAD to determine the relative ratio of FAD per AzoC . TCEP was added as a reducing agent to 
reduce disulfide bonds (5 mM TCEP) to understand th e ratio in reduced form. Following 
disulfide bond reduction with TCEP, the sample was passed through an Amicon Ultra 0.5 
(NMWL 10,000) filter to remove any unbound FAD.   
Bioinformatics Analysis 
Sequences and structures were obtained for other az oreductases whose crystal structures 
are known through the Protein Databank (www.pdb.org ) (Berman  et al , 2000). Secondary 
structures of other crystallized azoreductase prote ins were obtained through the Protein Databank 90 
 (www.pdb.org) and analyzed for the percentage of ea ch secondary structural element using 
PYMOL (Berman  et al , 2000; Goldin, 1990; PyMOL). Sequence alignments w ere performed 
using Clustal Omega using the default parameters (G oujon  et al , 2010; Sievers  et al , 2011). 
Sequence identities were generated by using the Seq uence Manipulation Suite 
(http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2) (Stothard, 200 0). Mega 5 was utilized for molecular 
phylogenetic analysis to generate a maximum likelih ood tree (Tamura  et al , 2011). The JTT 
matrix-based model was used with the highest log li kelihood (-2385.4617) (Jones  et al , 1992). 
Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtaine d automatically as follows: when the number of 
common sites was <100 or less than one fourth of th e total number of sites, the maximum 
parsimony method was used; otherwise, BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used.  
Results 
Cofactor Identification  
To identify the chemical identity of the flavin cof actor of AzoC, the native protein was 
heat denatured to release its cofactor, and protein -free cofactor extract was prepared for analysis 
using LC-MS. As seen in Figure 25, the mass spectru m of the AzoC cofactor is consistent with 
that of the FAD standard. The FMN standard (Figure 25A) shows a single strong peak at m/z 455 
and is considered to be FMN - and is not present in the mass spectrum of AzoC cof actor (Figure 
25C). The FAD standard, on the other hand, (Figure 25B) shows three significant peaks. The 
peak of m/z 784 is considered to be the FAD - peak and the peak of m/z 392 is considered to be 
the FAD 2- peak and both are present in the mass spectrum of t he AzoC cofactor (Figure 25C). 
Between the FAD standard (Figure 25B) and the AzoC cofactor (Figure 25C), the only difference 
was in a peak of significant intensity with a highe r m/z. The peak of m/z 807 in the FAD standard 
was determined to be a Na + adduct peak (presumably from the manufacturing of FAD) while the 
peak of m/z 822 in the AzoC cofactor was determined  to be a K + adduct peak (most likely a 91 
 remnant of the protein being in a potassium phospha te buffer). Based on these results we 
conclude that AzoC contains FAD as its flavin cofac tor.

 The FAD content of the enzyme was determined by mea suring the absorbance of AzoC at 
450 nm and converting to a molarity value by use of  the extinction coefficient of bound FAD 
from the literature, 11300 M -1cm -1 (Axley  et al , 1997). Throughout the process it was noted that 
the maximum absorbance of the flavin did not change  upon heat denaturation of AzoC. The AzoC 
concentration was determined to be 92.8 µM (± 2.5) and the FAD concentration was determined 
to be 96.7 µM (± 3.9). Based on the molarity of Azo C and FAD in the sample, the ratio between 
AzoC and FAD is calculated to be approximately 1:1,  which suggests that each AzoC binds to 1 
FAD.   
 
Figure 26.   MALDI-TOF spectroscopy of AzoC. The intense peak at m/z 25,043 Da (± 50 Da), is 
consistent with the molecular weight of AzoC (25,06 7.8 Da). The mid-sized peak at m/z 50,362 Da (± 50 
Da) is consistent with 2X the molecular weight of A zoC and thus represents a dimeric AzoC. The small 
peak at m/z 75,435 Da (± 50 Da) is consistent with 3X the molecular weight of AzoC and thus represents  a 
trimeric AzoC. Absent from these three peaks is the  mass of the cofactor (785.55 Da).

 MALDI-TOF spectroscopy showed an intense peak at m/ z 25,043 Da (± 50 Da), which is 
consistent with the molecular weight of AzoC (25,06 7.8 Da) and thus represents the monomeric 
form of AzoC (Figure 26). Absent from this peak is the mass of the cofactor (785.55 Da), which 
suggests that the ionization required for MALDI-TOF  is enough to dissociate the cofactor. 
Therefore, the cofactor is bound through non-covale nt interactions with AzoC.   
Secondary Structure Characterization 
Two experimental techniques were utilized to study the secondary structure of AzoC. In 
far UV-CD, the double minima present at 208 nm and 222 nm suggest the prevalence of 
significant α-helical regions (Figure 27A) (Tiffany  & Krimm, 1969). Secondary structural 
components were estimated from the spectrum as seen  in Figure 27A by the use of the on-line 
server Dichroweb with the SP175 reference data set and the CDSSTR algorithm (Compton & 
Johnson, 1986; Lees  et al , 2006; Whitmore & Wallace, 2004).  
AzoC appears to contain a significant portion of α- helix structures as well as a significant 
amount of unordered structure (Table 7). The NRMSD (normalized root mean square deviation) 
is significantly low (0.059 for oxidized AzoC and 0 .069 for reduced AzoC), suggesting a 
goodness of fit in the structural prediction. Becau se CD spectroscopy is relatively insensitive to 
β-sheet structures (Whitmore & Wallace, 2008), FTIR  spectroscopy was employed to 
characterize the secondary structure of AzoC in ord er to achieve more accurate estimate of the β-
sheet structures of AzoC (Figure 27B).

The stretching frequency of the backbone carbonyl C =O (Amide I) is sensitive to the 
geometry and hydrogen bonding interactions of the p rotein backbone, and has been widely used 
to characterize the secondary structures of protein s (Arrondo  et al , 1993; Barth & Zscherp, 2002; 
Decatur, 2006; Pelton & McLean, 2000). Spectral fit ting with combined Gaussian and Lorentzian 
spectral shapes using OPUS software (Bruker Optics)  are shown in Figure 27B and revealed that 
AzoC contains 29% α-helix, 32% β-sheet, 13% turn, a nd 26% unordered structure, as 
summarized in Table 7. The presence of β-sheets is identified from both the infrared absorption 
spectra and in the secondary derivatives of infrare d absorption (a large peak at 1638 cm -1). The 
overall secondary structural determination of AzoC shown in Table 7 is based on the weighted 
averaging of the CD and FTIR spectroscopic data.

 Multimeric State of AzoC 
The molecular weight of AzoC is 25.1 kDa based on i ts sequence. Figure 28A shows that, 
in the presence of this disulfide-bond reducing age nt TCEP, SDS-PAGE analysis reveals a 
molecular weight of ~25 kDa from reduced AzoC, cons istent that of monomer AzoC. However, 
when TCEP is absent from the SDS-PAGE, AzoC appears  to be ~75 kDa in size. Thus, the 
molecular weight of the oxidized AzoC is approximat ely three times of the molecular weight of 
AzoC monomer. The SDS-PAGE data of AzoC with and wi thout TCEP (Figure 28A) reveal that 
oxidized AzoC is a trimer which is held together by  inter-molecular disulfide bonds. 
  
Figure 28. Determination of the Multimeric State of AzoC.  A) SDS-PAGE of AzoC in reduced (with 
TCEP) and oxidized forms. B)  Size exclusion chromatography of oxidized and redu ced AzoC as compared 
to standards. X-axis (V e/V 0) was calculated dividing the elution volumes of th e standards (V e) by the 
elution volume of thyroglobulin (V 0) to obtain V e/V 0, which is plotted against the log of the standards ’ 
molecular weights. The fitted function was Log 10 MW = a ×(V e/V 0)+b , where a = -0.280  and b = 2.740 .  
AzoC sample molecular weights were estimated by the  equation of the line. Oxidized AzoC is predicted t o 
be 73.7 ± 6.6 kDa. Reduced AzoC is predicted to be 23.2 ± 1.9 kDa. PSI Plot (non-linear least squares 
fitting) was used to calculate error (PSI-Plot). 
 
SEC was performed to determine the multimeric natur e of reduced AzoC with non-
covalent interactions. As shown in Figure 28B, the linear relationship between the molecular 
weight of proteins and V e/V 0 was obtained from the SEC data of standard protein s. This linear 
A)  B)  96 
 relationship was used to find the unknown molecular  weight of oxidized and reduced AzoC based 
on their V e/V 0 values under identical SEC conditions. The errors in the molecular weight analysis 
were derived from 95% of confidence based on the ac curacy of the least square fitting. For V e/V 0 
of 3.11, the molecular weight of the oxidized AzoC is 73.7 ± 6.6 kDa, which is consistent with 
trimeric AzoC (75.2 kDa). For V e/V 0 of 4.90, the molecular weight of the reduced AzoC is 23.2 ± 
1.9 kDa, which is consistent with monomeric AzoC (2 5.1 kDa).   
As previously detailed, the FAD content of the mono meric (reduced) enzyme was 
determined by measuring the absorbance of AzoC at 4 50 nm and converting to a molarity value 
to be compared to the above results for the trimeri c (oxidized) enzyme. The AzoC concentration 
was determined to be 88.3 µM (± 2.6) for the reduce d sample and the FAD concentration was 
determined to be 92.7 µM (± 3.2). Based on the mola rity of AzoC and FAD in the sample, the 
ratio between AzoC and FAD is calculated to be appr oximately 1:1, which suggests that each 
AzoC binds to 1 FAD. As the ratio (1:1) was the sam e in both the oxidized and reduced form, it is 
suggested that each monomer of AzoC binds to one FA D molecule.   
Looking at the enzymatic specific activity of reduc ed (monomeric) AzoC versus the 
oxidized (trimeric) AzoC, the different forms do no t significantly affect specific activity. The 
enzymatic specific activity of the monomeric form i s not significantly different (p-value >0.05, 
95% confidence) than the trimeric form in terms of Direct Blue 15 reduction (Table 8).

 Thermal Stability of AzoC 
FTIR spectroscopy was utilized to study the thermal  stability of AzoC. The results, shown in 
Figure 29, reveal distinctive structural transition s in the temperature range of 20ºC-90ºC. AzoC is 
thermally stable from 20ºC to 40ºC. Initial thermal  denaturation of AzoC starts above 40ºC before 
reaching 50ºC, which is consistent with AzoC being from Clostridium perfringens , an inhabitant 
of the human intestine (37°C). Adsorption of AzoC t o the ATR diamond surface was observed 
between 40ºC-70ºC. Adsorption is detected through c hanges in the total Amide I band area 
(Figures 29A, 29B and 29C) as well as the peak at 1 616 cm -1 (Figure 29D). This particular peak 
shows up at a temperature between 40°C-50°C and bec ause of the principle of ATR cell 
measurement, the IR beam will penetrate into the sa mple a small depth. The growing peak at 
1616 cm -1, then, must come from adsorption to the surface of  the ATR cell. The adsorption 
process is normally invisible in the normal transmi ssion spectroscopy as used in CD 
spectroscopy. The use of the ATR cell makes it poss ible to observe this adsorption process. The 
concurrent processes of adsorption and initial dena turation indicate that AzoC adsorption might 
be triggered by its partial unfolding.  
The denaturation of AzoC was detected through chang es in the secondary structure using 
both secondary derivatives and difference spectra o f AzoC as shown in Figures 29D and 29E. As 
the temperature increases, both α-helix and native β-sheet structures are reduced (1653 & 1637 
cm -1) and a new denatured form of β-sheet structure (16 16 cm -1) begins to accumulate. Upon 
reaching 90ºC, AzoC forms a combination of highly u nordered structures (~1646 cm -1) and the 
denatured form of β-sheet (1616 cm -1). The mid-point melting temperature from FTIR stud ies is 
around 65ºC.

99 
 In addition to protein denaturation, FTIR spectrosc opy is sensitive to protein unfolding 
based on the solvent exposure of the backbone using  the Amide II signal of CNH stretching. 
Upon solvent exposure, the backbone CNH is exchange d to CND, causing the depletion of the 
Amide II signal around 1548 cm -1. FTIR data (Figure 29C) shows that at 90ºC, the Az oC 
backbone is fully solvent exposed (either transient ly or steadily). However, even as high as 80ºC, 
part of the AzoC backbone remains protected from H/ D exchange (solvent exposure). These 
results provide insight into the nature of AzoC unf olding upon thermal denaturation based on the 
fact that the backbone CNH is partially protected a s high as 80°C. Based on a simple two-state 
model that consists of a native state and an unfold ed state, the AzoC population in the unfolded 
state increases as temperature increases. The backb one CNH groups can be transiently solvent 
exposed during the thermal equilibrium between the folded and unfolded states, thus resulting 
depletion of the Amide II band due to H to D exchan ge at much lower temperature prior to 
thermal denaturation. The fact that the backbone CN H is partially protected as high as 80ºC may 
suggest a novel unfolding mechanism. 
Multimers of a protein are often more stable than m onomers (Creighton, 1992). CD 
spectroscopy was used to determine the unfolding te mperatures of the protein in its oxidized 
(trimeric) and reduced (monomeric) forms to underst and if the trimeric form of AzoC aids in 
stability. Denaturation profiles were plotted with increasing temperature for two fixed 
wavelengths (208 nm and 222 nm), which correspond t o the α-helix structures as observed in the 
CD absorption spectra (Figure 30). Analysis of the CD spectroscopic data revealed that the 
melting (i.e. unfolding) temperature of the AzoC mo nomer is slightly lower than that of the 
trimeric AzoC, as shown in Figure 30. However, the difference is small and not significant (p-
value >0.05, 95% confidence); the monomer unfolds a t a 3-5 °C lower temperature than the 
trimer.  100

Bioinformatics Analysis 
 Bioinformatics analysis (Figure 31) shows a very l ow level of sequence similarity 
between AzoC from C. perfringens and other azoreductases whose three-dimensional str uctures 
have been determined. As shown in the sequence alig nment in Figure 31A, only seven residues 
are identical amongst the six sequences compared (< 3%), while a slightly higher amount is 
conserved in terms of a strongly similar amino acid  substitution (<10%), and a lower amount is 
weakly conserved in terms of a weakly similar amino  acid substitution (<5%) (classifications of 
substitutions based on the Clustal Omega matrix). F rom looking at the alignment in Figure 31A, 
it is clear that the five sequences of azoreductase s having their three-dimensional structures 
known are very similar to each other in sequence bu t very different from AzoC. None of the 
conserved amino acid residues are AzoC’s eight cyst eines, which is highly unique for an 
azoreductase; of the other five azoreductases studi ed here, only the azoreductase from 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a cysteine (1) (Wang  et al , 2007). Though not highly conserved, 
the eight cysteines of AzoC are critical for disulf ide bond formation.

As shown by the crystal structure of the azoreducta se of E. coli , Asn-97, Phe-98, Gly-
141, Gly-142 and His-144 are essential for coordina tion of the flavin cofactor (Ito  et al , 2008). As 
seen in Figure 31A, Asn-97, Gly-141 and Gly-142 are  identical amongst the five azoreductases 
with their structures known. Only Gly-142 is identi cal when AzoC is compared as well and Gly-
141 is weakly conserved (an Ala in AzoC). Phe-98 an d His-144 are slightly conserved amongst 
the five structurally-known azoreductases, and comp letely variant in AzoC. In E. coli , Arg-59, 
Phe-98, Ala-112, Phe-118, Phe-159 and Phe-162 are c ritical to the active site of the azoreductase 
(Ito  et al , 2008). As seen in Figure 31A, Arg-59 is conserved  amongst the structurally-known 
azoreductases and AzoC and Phe-98 is identical betw een all azoreductases in Figure 31A. 102 
 However, Ala-112 shows high conservation amongst th e structurally-known azoreductases in 
small, hydrophobic residues whereas AzoC shows a po lar residue. Similarly, Phe-118 is identical 
amongst all of the structurally-known azoreductases , but is a Met in AzoC.  Phe-159 and Phe-162 
are highly conserved and identical, respectively, a mongst the structurally-known azoreductases 
but are absent in AzoC.  
As suggested by the sequence alignment, sequence id entity between AzoC and the 
structurally-known azoreductases is very low, as sh own in Figure 31B. When comparing AzoC to 
the other azoreductases, the values range from 9.6%  to 13.9%. However, when comparing 
between the five azoreductases with their structure s known, the values are much higher (range 
22.8% to 79.4%) going as high as 79.4% between E. coli and Y. pestis . When this similarity is 
viewed as a phylogenetic tree, AzoC is seen as in t he outgroup when compared to the 
azoreductases that have their structures known (Fig ure 31C), again showing its low level of 
sequence similarity with these other azoreductases.  
Discussion 
In this Chapter, the use of biophysical methods to characterize the AzoC enzyme is 
reported, including (1) a determination of the iden tity of the cofactor of AzoC, (2) a 
determination of the approximate secondary structur e of AzoC and (3) a determination of the 
polymeric state and stability of AzoC. In Chapter 2 , the azoreductase protein from Clostridium 
perfringens , AzoC, has been successfully identified, isolated and characterized AzoC. Because of 
the absence of structural information about azoredu ctases from strictly anaerobic 
microorganisms, a structural analysis of AzoC is ne cessary to fill in the literature gap and provide 
an understanding of the degree of similarity betwee n aerobic and anaerobic azoreductases.   
The cofactor of AzoC has been identified to be FAD (Figure 25). The use of FAD by 
AzoC is unique amongst azoreductases studied, as mo st azoreductases seem to prefer FMN 103 
 (Table 9) (Ito  et al , 2006; Liu  et al , 2007; Tan  et al , 2012; Wang  et al , 2007). While Clostridium 
perfringens cells contain both FAD and FMN, our results show th at FAD is preferred (Semde  et 
al , 1998). FMN is a much smaller molecule than FAD an d may be preferred based on size 
constraints in the flavin cofactor coordination sit e. Asn-97, Phe-98, Gly-141, Gly-142 and His-
144 have been shown to be important in flavin coord ination in E. coli  and are well conserved 
amongst the azoreductases of known structure but no t as well conserved in AzoC (Figure 31A) 
(Ito  et al , 2008). Because all of the structurally-known azor eductases require FMN, whereas 
AzoC requires FAD, it is hypothesized that the low similarity in this region is due to AzoC's 
requiring FAD as a cofactor and thus variant amino acids to coordinate it. Additionally, presented 
in this Chapter is a simplified and conclusive meth od for the rapid determination of the flavin 
cofactor for an azoreductase protein. In this Chapt er it has also been shown that AzoC has an 
FAD attached non-covalently in a 1:1 ratio. A 1:1 r atio of flavin cofactor to azoreductase 
monomer is consistent with the other azoreductases studied here (Ito  et al , 2006; Liu  et al , 2007; 
Tan  et al , 2012; Wang  et al , 2007).

 The secondary structure of AzoC was determined by u se of both CD and FTIR 
spectroscopic techniques. Both CD and FTIR spectros copies identified a large fraction of α-
helices in AzoC, and are consistent regarding the t urn structures (Table 7). The large discrepancy 
in β-sheet content is largely due to the relative i nsensitivity of CD spectroscopy to β-sheet as has 
been detailed by Whitmore and Wallace (Whitmore & W allace, 2008). Overall, β-sheets are more 
highly variable because they can be in variable ori entations with different twists and related 
phi/psi angles and can be overall less intense than  α-helices when seen by CD spectroscopy 
(Whitmore & Wallace, 2008). In proteins with high α -helical content, like AzoC, it is likely that 
the contribution of α-helices to the spectrum can o vershadow that of the β-sheets in CD 
spectroscopy (Whitmore & Wallace, 2008). In FTIR sp ectroscopy, the strong presence of β-sheet 
is clearly identified from both the infrared absorp tion spectra and in the secondary derivatives of 
infrared absorption (a large peak at 1638 cm -1). Therefore, FTIR spectroscopy is more sensitive t o 
β-sheet structural characterization than CD spectro scopy. Because CD spectroscopy is relatively 
insensitive to β-sheet structures, whereas FTIR spe ctroscopy does not have this issue, it is 
hypothesized that the combination of CD and FTIR sp ectroscopies will lead to more accurate 
protein secondary structure determination (Whitmore  & Wallace, 2008). The combined CD and 
FTIR spectroscopic data provides a more reliable se condary structure characterization of AzoC, 
as summarized in Table 7. Shown here is a simple, n ovel method for determination of protein 
secondary structure and thermal stability by the co mbined use of CD and FTIR spectroscopic 
techniques. 
AzoC was shown to be a trimer held together by disu lfide bonds under oxidized 
conditions. Disulfide bond connections between mono mers in azoreductases is unique to AzoC to 
the author’s knowledge; the presence of 8 cysteines  is also unique to AzoC when compared to the 
azoreductases of known structure (Figure 31A and Ta ble 9). Of the structurally-known 
azoreductases, AzoC is the only known trimer and is  thus structurally unique in multimeric form 105 
 (Table 9). The trimeric form, however, does not see m to be significantly more stable or 
enzymatically active than the monomer (Table 8 and Figure 30). In terms of enzymatic specific 
activity, the enzyme activity of the oxidized (trim eric) protein is not significantly different than 
that of the reduced (monomeric) protein, suggesting  that AzoC functions equally well as an 
azoreductase whether a monomer or a trimer (Table 8 ). Since the nature of the cytoplasmic 
environment where the azoreductase is produced is h ighly reducing (strictly anaerobic), it is not 
expected that the disulfide bonds that form the tri mer would occur naturally inside the cell 
(Derman  et al , 1993; Gilbert, 1990; Hwang  et al , 1992). However, if the protein is found to be 
secreted into the extracellular environment, the tr imer can be formed (Beebe  et al , 1990; Pollitt & 
Zalkin, 1983). It is also possible that the formati on of the disulfide bonds may play a role in an 
oxygen-protection mechanism, an observation which h as been noticed in other strictly anaerobic 
Gram-positive bacteria (Daniels  et al , 2010; Vita  et al , 2008). However, future work would be 
needed to study this further. Thermal stability stu dies with CD and FTIR were largely very 
consistent in terms of the determination of protein  melting temperature. Overall, the thermal 
stability studies with FTIR of AzoC showed an inter esting result. The backbone CNH appears to 
be partially protected and not completely unfolded at temperatures as high as 80°C, suggesting an 
unfolding mechanism that may be more complex than t he typical two-state mechanism for AzoC. 
Along with having low sequential similarity (Figure  31B), utilization of a different flavin 
cofactor and a unique multimeric state (Table 9), A zoC also shows differences secondary 
structural characteristics when compared with the a zoreductases that have their crystal structures 
known. All of the azoreductases examined in this Ch apter contain significant α-helical character, 
with much less β-sheet structure. When compared to the average azoreductase, AzoC contains 
16% less α-helices, 5% more β-sheets and 11% more u nordered structure. Also, the ratio of α-
helix to β-sheet is 1.5 in AzoC, whereas the same r atio is approximately 2.5 in the structurally 
known azoreductases. AzoC contains a significant am ount of unordered loop structures that is 106 
 higher than the structurally-known azoreductases. I n this way, AzoC is significantly different than 
the other azoreductases (Table 9).

NON-CLASSICAL AZOREDUCTASE SECRETION IN CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS  IN 
RESPONSE TO SULFONATED AZO DYE EXPOSURE AND THE GEN ERATION OF A 
ΔazoC  KNOCKOUT MUTANT 
Abstract 
Clostridium perfringens , a strictly anaerobic microorganism and inhabitant  of the human 
intestine, has been shown to produce an azoreductas e enzyme (AzoC), an NADH-dependent 
flavin oxidoreductase. This enzyme reduces azo dyes  into aromatic amines, which can be 
carcinogenic. A significant amount of work has been  completed on the activity of AzoC. Despite 
this, much is still unknown, including whether azor eduction of these dyes occurs intracellularly or 
extracellulary. In addition to this, to date, a gen e knockout mutant for any azoreductase in 
bacteria has not been completed. The Sigma-Aldrich TargeTron Gene Knockout System was 
utilized for targeted specific gene disruption by G roup II intron insertion within the azoC  gene of 
the C. perfringens genome. A physiological study of C. perfringens involving the effect of azo 
dye exposure was completed to fill the literature g ap. Through exposure studies, azo dyes were 
found to cause cytoplasmic protein release, includi ng AzoC, from C. perfringens in dividing and 
non-dividing cells. Sulfonation (negative charge) o f azo dyes proved to be the key to facilitating 
protein release of AzoC and was found to be azo-dye -concentration-dependent. Additionally, 
AzoC was found to localize to the Gram-positive per iplasmic region. Using the ΔazoC  knockout 
mutant, the presence of additional azoreductases in  C. perfringens was suggested. These results  108 
 support the notion that the azoreduction of these d yes may occur extracellularly for the 
commensal C. perfringens in the intestine. 
Introduction 
 Bacterial azoreductases are enzymes which are capa ble of reducing azo dyes into their 
component amines (Levine, 1991). Azo dyes are commo n synthetic colorants which are used in 
many industries spanning foods and beverages to tex tiles and paper products (Chen, 2006; Chung  
et al , 1992). Azo dyes possess a namesake azo bond (-N=N -), which makes them capable of 
being reduced into their component aromatic amines by the azoreductase enzyme (Stolz, 2001). 
These aromatic amine metabolites have been found to  be carcinogenic in many cases (Rafii & 
Coleman, 1999). Aside from being a threat to human health, azo dyes are also frequently found as 
environmental pollutants, an end result of industri al processing applications (Chen, 2006; Chung  
et al , 1992; Stolz, 2001).  
Azoreductases have been studied in a large variety of bacteria, including those important 
for both the environment and human health (Blumel &  Stolz, 2003; Chen  et al , 2005a; Chen  et al , 
2004; Nakanishi  et al , 2001; Sugiura  et al , 2006). The azoreductase from Clostridium perfringens 
(AzoC) has recently been characterized and several u nique attributes have been revealed, as 
detailed in Chapters 2-4 (Morrison  et al , 2014; Morrison & John, 2013; Morrison  et al , 2012). 
First, AzoC is significantly different from other w ell-studied azoreductases in terms of its 
sequence and structure (see Chapter 4). The azoredu ctase with the highest sequence identity with 
AzoC is AzoA from Enterococcus faecalis , which shares only 13% amino acid sequence identit y 
(Morrison  et al , 2014). AzoC possesses a trimeric structure with e ach monomer non-covalently 
bound to a redox cofactor, flavin adenine dinucleot ide (FAD). The FAD cofactor is unique 
amongst other azoreductases studied to date, where all other studied azoreductases utilize flavin 
mononucleotide (FMN). AzoC monomers are held togeth er by disulfide bonding forming a 109 
 trimeric structure; no other trimeric azoreductases  have been determined to date (Morrison  et al , 
2014). Second, AzoC is the only azoreductase from a  strict anaerobe, as other azoreductases are 
from aerobic-respiring microorganisms. Thus, in vivo  and in vitro  optimal AzoC enzyme activity 
requires reduced levels of oxygen (Morrison  et al , 2014; Morrison & John, 2013; Morrison  et al , 
2012). Third, AzoC  has a very different substrate preference compared to other highly studied 
azoreductases (Chen  et al , 2005a; Chen  et al , 2004; Feng  et al , 2010; Macwana  et al , 2010; Maier  
et al , 2004; Morrison  et al , 2012). AzoC prefers large molecular weight, sulfo nated azo dyes (e.g. 
Direct Blue 15 and Ponceau BS), whereas other azore ductases tend to prefer smaller molecular 
weight non-sulfonated azo dyes (e.g. Methyl Red and  Methyl Orange) (Chen  et al , 2005a; Chen  
et al , 2004; Feng  et al , 2010; Macwana  et al , 2010; Maier  et al , 2004; Morrison  et al , 2014; 
Morrison & John, 2013; Morrison  et al , 2012).  
Although the literature is replete with azoreductas e studies, physiological information on 
whether the interaction of azoreductase and azo dye s occurs intracellularly or extracellularly is 
largely lacking, and what is there is controversial . The literature has contrasting views on whether 
azoreductase activity occurs intracellular (Feng  et al , 2010) or extracellular (Maier  et al , 2004; 
Stolz, 2001) or both, depending on the specific azo  dye and its chemical characteristics (Punj & 
John, 2008). 
The enzyme would need to be able to exit the cell i f the azo dye and azoreductase were to 
interact extracellularly. Classical protein secreti on systems are complex structures involved in 
translocating and excreting proteins (Schneewind & Missiakas, 2012). These systems in C. 
perfringens have not been studied. However, in closely related taxa ( C. tetani and C. 
acetobutylicum ) the secretion translocation system (Sec) is the m ost common mechanism for 
protein excretion into the extracellular environmen t via Sec-dependent protein signal sequences 
(Bruggemann  et al , 2003; Desvaux  et al , 2005). Other translocation systems such as the tw in 
arginine translocation system (Tat) have not been r eported to date in any Clostridium species 110 
 (Berks  et al , 2005; Desvaux  et al , 2005). Previous research has shown that AzoC does  not contain 
a signal peptide and is therefore predicted to be a n intracellular azoreductase by its sequence 
(Morrison  et al , 2014; Morrison  et al , 2012).  
Extracellular to the cell membrane of Gram-positive  bacteria lies a small periplasmic 
space (Forster & Marquis, 2012; Navarre & Schneewin d, 1999). This Gram-positive periplasmic 
space consists of proteins and lipoteichoic acid th at are anchored to the cell membrane (Forster & 
Marquis, 2012; Matias & Beveridge, 2008). Technical ly, the periplasmic space is an inner-wall 
zone (30 nm thick) which is significantly less than  a typical Gram-negative cell wall periplasmic 
space (Forster & Marquis, 2012). Beyond the peripla smic space are surface proteins that are 
covalently linked to the peptidoglycan. Interesting ly, in a recent study of the cell-surface proteins 
of C. perfringens strain ATCC 13124, several of the extracellular sur face proteins that were 
identified were actually predicted to be intracellu lar in nature due to function or lack of a signal 
peptide (Alam  et al , 2009). 
This phenomenon has been frequently observed in an increasing number of proteins 
throughout Gram-positive bacteria (Alam  et al , 2009; Bukau & Horwich, 1998; Cole  et al , 2005; 
Severin  et al , 2007; Shimizu  et al , 2002a; Shimizu  et al , 2002b; Walz  et al , 2007). In fact, a study 
in C. perfringens strain 13 showed  that the extracellular culture supernatant followin g late 
exponential phase contained non-signal sequence pro teins that were predicted to be intracellular 
(Shimizu  et al , 2002a; Shimizu  et al , 2002b). The mechanism by which these proteins are  able to 
exit the cell without a signal sequence is yet to b e described and is commonly referred to as non-
classical protein secretion (Wickner & Schekman, 20 05). A recent study in E. coli has suggested 
that environmental extracellular stress on the cell  wall can cause proteins to selectively release 
from the intracellular space (Vazquez-Laslop  et al , 2001). Despite not having a signal peptide, it 
is possible that a signal response or non-covalent interaction may cause AzoC to translocate 111 
 across the membrane, non-covalently associate with the cell wall, and eventually exist under the 
right conditions as extracellular azoreductase. 
To garner a complete look at the effect of AzoC on C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 , 
AzoC will be knocked out. To our knowledge, this is  the first knockout of an azoreductase gene 
completed, as well as the first recorded gene knock out in C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626. Other 
important genes have been knocked out in other stra ins of C. perfringens by the use of a 
Targetron Gene Knockout kit, optimized for this par ticular bacteria (Chen  et al , 2007; Chen  et al , 
2005b; Gupta & Chen, 2008; Heap  et al , 2010a; Heap  et al , 2010b; Heap  et al , 2007; Li & 
McClane, 2008; Li & McClane, 2010). 
The goals of this Chapter are to create a ΔazoC knockout mutant, to use  azo dye exposure 
studies to understand the physiological effects of azo dye exposure on C. perfringens and to 
analyze AzoC protein release in this bacteria to de termine the cellular location of azoreductase 
activity.   
Materials and Methods 
Bacterial Strains and Azo Dyes  
Clostridium perfringens  strain ATCC 3626 was grown anaerobically, under st atic growth 
conditions (non-shaking) in Brain Heart Infusion (B HI) broth (Difco Laboratories) at 37°C, 
unless otherwise noted.   
The following azo dyes were used during this invest igation: Direct Blue 15 (MP 
Biomedicals), Methyl Red (Acros Organics), Ponceau BS (Sigma-Aldrich), Methyl Orange 
(Allied Chemicals). Sodium benzene sulfonate served  as the non-azo dye compound and was 
purchased from TCI America. Chemical compound struc tures can be seen in Figure 32.

Creation of a ΔazoC Knockout Mutant 
A ΔazoC  knockout mutant was created by inactivating the azoC gene in C. perfringens by 
the insertion of a group II intron using the TargeT ron (Sigma-Aldrich) insertional mutagenesis 
system with a Clostridium -modified protocol and plasmid (Chen  et al , 2005b). The Sigma 
TargeTron algorithm (www.sigma-genosys.com/targetro n/) was utilized to identify optimal intron 
insertion sequence sites within the azoC gene sequence. An intron was targeted in the sense 
orientation between nucleotides 228 and 229 of the azoC open reading frame, as this particular 
region has the highest score (9.72) and the lowest E-value (0.028). Low E-values correspond to 
the highest efficiency designs (Chen  et al , 2005b). The azoC -specific targeting primers used for 
this process were: IBS (5’-AAAAA AGCTT ATAAT TATCC TTAAA GGACG CAGAT 
GTGCG CCCAG ATAGG GTG-3’), EBS1d (5’-CAGAT TGTAC AA ATG TGGTG ATAAC 
113 
 AGATA AGTCG CAGAT GGTAA CTTAC CTTTC TTTGT-3’), EBS2  (5’-TGAAC GCAAG 
TTTCT AATTT CGGTT TCCTT CCGAT AGAGG AAAGT GTCT-3’),  and a Targetron-
provided EBS Universal Primer. Primers were diluted  upon receipt to the following 
concentrations: IBS (100 µM), EBS1d (100 µM), EBS2 (20 µM), EBS Universal Primer (20 
µM). The four primers were used to create a Primer Master Mix by mixing 2 µL of each primer to 
20 µL in water for total Primer Master Mix volume. 
A 50 µL total volume PCR reaction, with the aim of retargeting the provided intron to be 
specific for targeting the azoC gene, was set-up by using 1 µL of the four Primer M aster Mix, 1 
µL of the Targetron-kit provided Intron PCR templat e, and 25 µL JumpStart REDTaq ReadyMix 
(Sigma-Aldrich), with water to volume. The PCR reac tion consisted of an initial denaturation of 
30 seconds at 94°C, 30 cycles of denaturation (15 s econds at 94°C), annealing (30 seconds at 
55°C) and extension (30 seconds at 72°C), followed by a final extension of 2 minutes at 72°C. 
PCR was performed in an MJ Researcher PTC-100 Progr ammable Thermal Cycler. The PCR 
reaction was run on a 4% agarose gel to confirm tha t a 350 bp band was present, as it is the 
expected product of the PCR-retargeting procedure. Following confirmation, the PCR product 
was purified using the GenElute PCR Clean-up Kit (S igma-Aldrich). 
A double restriction enzyme digestion was performed  to cut the intron PCR product from 
above to produce cohesive ends to be able to be lig ated into the Clostridium -specific vector. 
HindIII  (20 U/µL)  and BsrGI  (10 U/µL) were added in a double digestion reaction  that included 
200 ng of purified PCR product, 2 µL of 10X Restric tion Enzyme Buffer (compatible with both 
HindIII  and BsrGI), 1 µL each of HindIII  and BsrGI, and water to a 20 µL total reaction volu me. 
The reaction was completed in an MJ Researcher PTC- 100 Programmable Thermal Cycler for 30 
minutes at 37°C, 30 minutes at 60°C and 10 minutes at 80°C. The same double restriction 
enzyme digestion was also performed on the Clostridium -specific pJIR750ai plasmid to produce 
cohesive ends. 114 
 Ligation of the cut pJIR750ai plasmid and azoC -targeted intron was performed by using 
the Quick-Link T4 DNA Ligation Kit (Sigma-Aldrich).  Briefly, 40 ng of the HindIII /BsrGI -cut 
pJIR750ai plasmid and 6 µL of the HindIII /BsrGI-cut intron PCR product were added together 
and mixed with 10 µL of the provided Quick-Link Buf fer A and 2 µL of the provided Quick-Link 
Buffer B for a total reaction volume of 20 µL. The components were mixed together and heated 
to 60°C for 30 seconds, followed by cooling on ice for 1 minute. Quick-Link Ligase was then 
added (1 µL) and mixed. The reaction was allowed to  progress for 30 minutes at room 
temperature. 
This plasmid, pJIR750aiAzoC, was electroporated int o C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 
(Gupta & Chen, 2008). Briefly, 0.2 mL of the C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 cells were 
inoculated into the bottom of a tube of 10 mL fluid  thioglycollate media for an overnight culture 
at 37°C, without shaking (Gupta & Chen, 2008). The overnight culture (0.2 mL) was used to 
inoculate 10 mL TGY broth (30 g/L trypticase, 10 g/ L yeast extract, 20 g/L glucose, 1 g/L l-
cysteine) for a second overnight culture at 37°C, w ithout shaking (Gupta & Chen, 2008). The C. 
perfringens cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 x g, 1 0 minutes, 4°C) and washed twice 
with SMP buffer (270 mM sucrose, 1 mM MgCl 2, 7 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3) 
(Gupta & Chen, 2008). Following washing, C. perfringens cells were resuspended in 400 μL of 
SMP buffer and placed into a 0.2 cm Gene Pulser cuv ette (Bio-Rad) with 5 μg of the 
pJIR750aiAzoC plasmid (Gupta & Chen, 2008). The cuv ette was electroporated with a single 
pulse of 2.5 kV at 25 μF capacitance and 200 Ω resi stance using a Gene Pulser Xcell 
Electroporation System (Bio-Rad) (Gupta & Chen, 200 8). Following the electroporation, the cells 
were rescued into 3 mL of warmed TGY broth, making sure to rinse the cuvette with additional 
TGY broth to recover any additional cells (Gupta & Chen, 2008). The electroporated cells were 
incubated at 37°C without shaking for 3 hours (Gupt a & Chen, 2008).  115 
 Transformants were selected by anaerobic growth on BHI agar plates containing 
chloramphenicol (15 μg/mL). Selected transformants were grown in 10 mL anaerobic BHI 
cultures containing chloramphenicol (15 μg/mL) and their genomic DNA was extracted using a 
Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Wizard). Following ge nomic DNA extraction, PCR was utilized 
to confirm the presence of intron insertion within the azoC gene by using AzoC-sequence specific 
primers: azoC- F (5’-CGGCC TCGAG ATGAA AGTAT TATTA GTTA-3’), azoC- R (5’-
GTGAA AGGAT CCGCT GATTA AAATT AACTT TGATA TATTT CAC -3’) (see Chapter 2) 
(Morrison  et al , 2012; Wright, 2007). PCR was carried out in a MJ Research PTC-100 
Programmable Thermal Cycler. Conditions for amplifi cation were as follows: one cycle of 2 
minutes at 94°C, 25 cycles with each cycle consisti ng of 1 minute at 94°C, 1 minute at 55°C, and 
1 minute at 72°C, and a final extension of 7 minute s at 72°C.  The PCR amplicon was observed by 
0.8% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium  bromide staining using a 1 Kb ladder 
(Promega) and 100 bp ladder (Fermentas GeneRuler).  
AzoC Purification and Antibody Production  
E. coli (DE3) NovaBlue cells harboring an AzoC-containing p lasmid and required His-
tag were prepared by Cristee Wright (see Chapter 2)  (Morrison  et al , 2012; Wright, 2007). These 
cells were inoculated into 5 mL of LB broth contain ing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Cultures were 
incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm . This culture, following overnight 
incubation, was transferred to 1 L of LB broth with  100 μg/mL ampicillin and incubated while 
shaking at 200 rpm until an OD 600 of 0.6 was reached. At this point, the culture was induced with 
isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a 1 mM concentration for 3 hours at 37°C and 
shaking at 200 rpm. Cultures were pelleted by centr ifugation (6000 x g, 10 minutes, 4°C). The 
supernatant was discarded while the pellet was stor ed frozen at -20°C until AzoC purification 
could occur. 116 
  The cell pellet from above was thawed and resuspen ded in 10 mL of lysis/wash buffer 
(20 mM imidazole, 750 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM sod ium monobasic phosphate, 20% 
glycerol, deionized water, pH 8.0). Following resus pension, cells were lysed by the addition of 
lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL final concentration); following  lysozyme addition, cells were incubated on 
ice for 30 minutes. Cells suspensions were then son icated using a Sonic 300 dismembranator with 
an intermediate tip with relative output set at 60% . Sonication occurred 10 times, 5 seconds each, 
with placing the cells on ice in between sonication s to ensure that any proteins released did not 
denature. Following sonication, the cell suspension  was centrifuged (10,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4°C) 
to pellet cell debris. The proteinaceous supernatan t was stored at 4°C until further purification 
could occur, while the cell debris pellet was disca rded. 
 AzoC purification occurred as follows. The protein aceous supernatant from the previous 
step was introduced to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic ac id (Ni-NTA) resin suspension (UBP-Bio) in a 
glass frit column (Kimble-Chase Flex Column). The H istidine tag of the AzoC protein is what 
allows for AzoC to interact with the Ni 2+ on the resin and is what allows for this protein 
purification procedure to succeed. All of the steps  of the purification procedure occurred at 4°C to 
make sure that AzoC did not denature during the pro cess. Following the application of AzoC to 
the Ni-NTA resin, the mixture was allowed to incuba te, in the column, at 4°C while shaking 
horizontally at medium speed on a BioDancer orbital  shaker (New Brunswick Scientific). This 
hour-long incubation allows adequate time for the h istidine tag of AzoC to interact with the Ni 2+ 
bound to the resin in the column. Following incubat ion, solution was drained from the column 
and the resin in the column was washed with lysis/w ash buffer until the solution leaving the 
column was clear. Pure AzoC was eluted from the col umn by exposure of the resin to elution 
buffer (250 mM imidazole, 750 mM sodium chloride, 5 0 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 20% 
glycerol, deionized water, pH 8.0). Elutions were c arried out until the yellow-colored AzoC was 
eluted from the column. The elutions were saved and  stored frozen at -20°C. 117 
 Purified AzoC (1 mg at a 100 μg/mL concentration) w as used by Thermo Fisher 
Scientific Custom Services (Rockford, IL) to produc e a rabbit anti-AzoC polyclonal antibody. In 
short, a total of four immunizations of AzoC were a dministered to two rabbits on a 90-day 
protocol. Injections were given at four separate su bcutaneous sites to foster an immune system 
reaction to generate the anti-AzoC antibody. A tota l of four bleeds for antibodies were taken 
during the 90-day protocol, along with a terminal b leed following the 90 days. Thermo Fisher 
Scientific Custom Services provided us with approxi mately 90 mL of AzoC-active sera per rabbit 
immunized.  
SDS-PAGE  
Protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel ele ctrophoresis. SDS-PAGE analysis 
was performed as previously described (Laemmli, 197 0). Prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE, 15 μL 
of protein sample was mixed with 5 μL of SDS-PAGE l oading buffer (0.06 M TRIS-HCl pH 6.8, 
10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.0025% (w/v) bro mophenol blue). Beta-mercaptoethanol 
was added as a reducing agent (5%) to denature disu lfide bonds. Prepared samples were boiled 
for 15 minutes and then the total volume was loaded  onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. For protein 
analysis, following gel run, Coomassie blue was use d as the protein stain and protein bands were 
visualized and photographed in comparison to an uns tained protein molecular weight marker 
(14.4-116 kDa, Thermo Scientific). A pre-stained pr otein molecular weight marker was used for 
Western blotting gels (2-250 kDa, Bio-Rad).  
Western Blotting  
To observe the absence of the AzoC protein in the ΔazoC knockout mutants and the 
presence in the Wild Type cells, protein fractions extracted from the cells as described below 
were analyzed by Western Blotting with an anti-AzoC  antibody. Following separation by SDS-
PAGE, the proteins were transferred to an Immun-Blo t PVDF Membrane (Bio-Rad) using a Mini 118 
 Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad) for 1 hour, chilled with an ice block, and set 
at 100 V. The membrane was washed three times with deionized water, and then blocked in TBS-
3% (w/v) gelatin for 30 minutes at room temperature . Following blocking, the membrane was 
washed in TBS-0.05% (v/v) Tween (TBST). The membran e was then exposed to the primary 
antibody (rabbit-anti-AzoC) at a 1:1000 dilution in  TBST-1% (w/v) gelatin for 1 hour at room 
temperature. Following primary antibody exposure, t he membrane was washed twice with TBST. 
The membrane was exposed to a 1:300 dilution (in TB ST-1% (w/v) gelatin) of horse radish 
peroxidase (HRP) conjugated with goat anti-rabbit I gG (H+L) secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) for 
1 hour. Following secondary antibody treatment, the  membrane was washed twice in TBST and 
once in TBS. To develop the Western blot, the membr ane was exposed to 4-CN solution as per 
the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). The memb ranes were imaged using an Alpha Innotech 
Imager and corresponding software was used for imag e viewing. Due to the colorimetric reaction 
that occurs in the Western blot procedure, the West ern blot results are qualitative only (detect the 
presence, not quantity of AzoC) (Levine  et al , 2000; Patton, 2002; Westermeier & Marouga, 
2005). 
Protein Extraction from C. perfringens  
C. perfringens (Wild Type strain ATCC 3626 and the ΔazoC knockout mutant)  cultures 
in 5 mL anaerobic BHI broth were prepared and incub ated overnight at 37°C. Overnight cultures 
were transferred to a total of 500 mL anaerobic BHI  media and grown statically at 37°C until an 
OD 600  of 0.6 was reached. Optical density measurements w ere taken with a Shimadzu UV-
1650PC spectrophotometer with a 1 cm path length. C ells were pelleted by centrifugation (6000 x 
g, 10 minutes, 4°C). The cell pellets were resuspen ded in 10 mL of TRIS buffer and prepared for 
lysis, in order to extract proteins. Lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL final concentration) was added and cells 
were incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were th en disrupted by sonication (performed 10 
times, 5 seconds each, icing in between, at 60 Hz).  The sonicated cells were pelleted by 119 
 centrifugation (10,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4°C). Super natants were saved as the proteinaceous 
fraction. 
Non-Dividing Cells Exposed to Azo Dyes  
Azo dye exposure studies using non-dividing C. perfringens  cells were performed and 
designed as previously described (Vazquez-Laslop  et al , 2001). All compounds shown in Figure 
32 were tested with C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626. Cultures of C. perfringens in 5 mL 
anaerobic BHI broth were prepared and incubated ove rnight at 37°C. These cultures were then 
transferred to a total of 500 mL anaerobic BHI and grown until an OD 600  of 0.6 was reached. 
Optical density measurements were taken with a Shim adzu UV-1650PC spectrophotometer with 
a 1 cm path length. Cells from the 500 mL culture w ere pelleted by centrifugation (6000 x g, 10 
minutes, 4°C). The cell pellets were exposed to the  dyes by resuspending the cell pellets in 10 mL 
of TRIS buffer (10 mM TRIS, pH 7.5) containing the appropriate azo dye or sodium benzene 
sulfonate (20 μM final concentration), and incubate d for 10 minutes on ice. For time and 
concentration-dependence studies, exposure time poi nts of 1 and 100 minutes and variant azo dye 
concentrations of 2 μM and 200 μM were also prepare d and tested in the same manner. Tris 
buffer (10 mM TRIS, pH 7.5) without azo dye served as a no-dye-exposed control. Following the 
first exposure, cells were pelleted by centrifugati on (6000 x g, 10 minutes, 4°C). The resultant 
extracellular supernatant was saved and analyzed fo r proteins. As a wash, the cell pellet was 
resuspended again in 10 mL of TRIS buffer (10 mM TR IS, pH7.5), incubated on ice for 10 
minutes, and pelleted as before. The cell pellets w ere resuspended in 10 mL of TRIS buffer (10 
mM TRIS, pH 7.5) and prepared for lysis, in order t o extract the intracellular proteins. Lysozyme 
(0.1 mg/mL final concentration) was added and cells  were incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Cells 
were then lysed by sonication (performed 10 times, 5 seconds each, icing in between, at 60 Hz). 
The sonicated cells were pelleted by centrifugation  (10,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4°C). Supernatants 
were saved as the intracellular fractions. 120 
 Dividing Cells Exposed to Azo Dyes  
To compare and understand any differences in protei n release by dividing and non-
dividing cells, actively growing cultures (dividing  cells) were also tested for their response to azo 
dye exposure. Overnight C. perfringens cultures were inoculated into anaerobic BHI and gro wn 
until an OD 600  of 0.4 was reached (early log phase). The early-lo g phase culture (1 mL) was 
transferred to 10 mL anaerobic BHI containing 20 μM  of the appropriate azo dye (Figure 32) or 
an equal volume of deionized water as a control and  incubated. After 2.5 hours of incubation, 
mid-log phase (OD 600 of 0.6) cells were pelleted by centrifugation (6,00 0 x g, 10 minutes, 4°C). 
At this phase of growth (mid-log phase), a signific ant dye reduction was observed, and the 
resultant supernatant was saved as the extracellula r fraction. Intracellular fractions were obtained 
by cell lysis as previously mentioned.  
Periplasmic Fraction  
In an effort to pinpoint the location of the azored uctase, the Gram-positive periplasmic 
region was isolated (Stal & Blaschek, 1985). This f raction was compared to the extracellular and 
intracellular fractions. To begin, C. perfringens cultures were grown anaerobically in modified 
Fluid Thioglycollate media (mFTM) (Stal & Blaschek,  1985). Following overnight growth, 
mFTM media with 0.4% (w/v) glycine was inoculated a nd incubated (500 mL culture) (Stal & 
Blaschek, 1985). Once cultures reached an OD 600  of 0.6, they were centrifuged (11,000 x g, 10 
minutes, 4°C). Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mL of TRIS buffer (10 mM TRIS, pH 7.5), 
with or without Direct Blue 15 azo dye (20 μM final  concentration). To obtain the Gram-positive 
periplasmic fraction, the cell pellets were resuspe nded in a 10 mL anaerobic osmotically stable 
solution (50 mM TRIS, 0.5 M sucrose, 25 mM calcium chloride, 25 mM magnesium chloride, in 
mFTM) with 1 mg/mL lysozyme. Cells were incubated t o allow them to form protoplasts. 
Following incubation and protoplast formation, cell s were centrifuged (4,500 x g, 10 minutes, 121 
 25°C); at this point, the cell pellet and supernata nt were separated. The supernatant, which 
contained cell wall debris, as well as the periplas mic region, was isolated and centrifuged further 
(10,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4°C) to remove cell wall d ebris and to isolate proteins from the Gram-
positive periplasmic region. This supernatant was r etained as the periplasmic fraction. For 
intracellular fractions, the previously formed prot oplast cell pellet was resuspended in TRIS 
buffer (10 mM TRIS, pH 7.5) and sonicated 10 times,  consisting of 5 seconds pulses each time, 
icing in between pulses and the setting at 60 Hz. T he sonicated cells were pelleted by 
centrifugation (10,000 x g, 30 minutes, 4°C). The s upernatant was saved as the intracellular 
fraction.  
Azoreductase Enzyme Activity 
Enzymatic activity was tested on all fractions (ext racellular, periplasmic and 
intracellular). Proteins were concentrated to appro ximately 1 mg/mL using ammonium sulfate 
precipitation. Briefly, ammonium sulfate was mixed with supernatant to a final ammonium 
sulfate concentration of 80% (w/v) and mixed at roo m temperature for 15 minutes with vigorous 
stirring. Following precipitation, the solution was  centrifuged (10,000 x g, 15 minutes, 4°C). The 
supernatant was discarded and pellet (precipitated protein) was resuspended in 1 mL of TRIS 
buffer (10 mM TRIS, pH 7.5).  
 Azoreductase enzyme activity was tested in a 1.5 m L polystyrene cuvette (Sigma-
Aldrich), 50 μL of concentrated protein was added t o the reaction mixture (final concentration 25 
mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 20 μM of the appro priate azo dye). Deionized water was 
added to a final volume of 1 mL. To create an anaer obic environment, the reaction mixture was 
bubbled with nitrogen at a rate of 1 nitrogen bubbl e per second for 10 minutes. Immediately after 
bubbling, mineral oil was added to the cuvette/mixt ure to maintain an anaerobic environment for 
the duration of the experiment. To activate the rea ction, a mixture of 10 mM NADH (Acros 122 
 Organics) and 2 mM FAD (Sigma-Aldrich) was added by  penetrating the mineral oil layer as to 
limit the amount of introduced oxygen. This reactio n was scanned at room temperature using a 
Shimadzu UV-1650PC spectrophotometer (1 cm pathleng th) at a wavelength that was previously 
determined to be optimal for each azo dye: Direct B lue 15 (602.5 nm), Methyl Red (430.0 nm), 
Methyl Orange (425.0 nm), Ponceau BS (505.0 nm). Dy e absorbance was followed over a period 
of 30 minutes. The concentration of the dye was det ermined from a standard curve of known dye 
concentrations vs absorbance based on the Beer-Lamb ert law. Each experiment was performed in 
triplicate. 
Cell Lysis/Leakage Assays  
To understand whether the observed protein release was the result of cellular lysis or 
membrane leakage, cell viability experiments were c ompleted. First, to determine whether cells 
were lysing, as opposed to actively releasing prote in, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was 
performed. C. perfringens is known to produce LDH, an intracellular enzyme an d a common 
predictor of cell lysis (Korzeniewski & Callewaert,  1983; Shimizu  et al , 2002a). A Pierce LDH 
Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) was util ized for this experiment. Collected 
concentrated fractions (extracellular, periplasmic,  intracellular) following azo dye and control 
exposure were tested for LDH activity according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A standard 
curve was generated by plotting known LDH concentra tions against their absorbance values 
(A 490 ) to generate an equation of a line from which expe rimental LDH concentrations could be 
extrapolated. Experiments were performed in triplic ate. 
Second, to determine whether the C. perfringens cell membranes were leaking to release 
protein, a cell membrane viability assay was perfor med. The Trypan Blue method for cell 
viability testing is a tried and true method which can identify viable cells over non-viable cells 
with a leaky cell membrane (Strober, 2001; Tennant,  1964). By this method, cells with an intact 123 
 cell membrane exclude the large polar dye, whereas cells with a damaged or leaky cell membrane 
are stained blue (Strober, 2001; Tennant, 1964). C. perfringens cells following exposure to all azo 
dyes, sodium benzene sulfonate, or buffer (as a con trol) were resuspended in TRIS buffer (10 
mM TRIS, pH 7.5). Cell suspensions were mixed (1:1 dilution) with 0.4% (w/v) Trypan Blue 
solution and dilutions were prepared to ensure coun tability (between 15 and 50 cells per 1 mm 2 
grid). A hemocytometer was loaded and grids were vi sualized by Phase Contrast microscopy. The 
number of viable (unstained) and non-viable (blue) cells were counted, and the percent cell 
viability was calculated for four replicates.  
To ensure that the C. perfringens cells were not forming endospores to interfere with  the 
cell viability assays, endospore stains were perfor med on all cell samples. Endospore staining was 
performed as previously described (Schaeffer & Fult on, 1933).  
Results 
azoC Gene Inactivation: Creation of a ΔazoC Knockout Mut ant 
 PCR analysis using the azoC- F and azoC -R primers confirmed the presence of the 
targetron in the middle of the azoC gene in C. perfringens knockout cells, as compared to the 
azoC gene in the Wild Type (Figure 33A). Sequencing of t his ~1500 bp band confirmed that the 
intron was inserted at the correct location in the azoC gene.  
 To further confirm the absence of the AzoC protein  in the C. perfringens ΔazoC knockout 
mutant, Western blot analysis was performed. As sho wn in Figure 33B, no production of AzoC 
was detected from the ΔazoC knockout mutant (Figure 33B, Lane 1), as compared t o the Wild 
Type (Figure 33B, Lane 2) and AzoC pure protein pos itive control (Figure 33B, Lane 3). These 
results confirm the presence of a successful knocko ut of the azoC gene in C. perfringens strain 
ATCC 3626. 124

AzoC) (Levine  et al , 2000; Patton, 2002; Westermeier & Marouga, 2005).  Therefore, these Western Blots 
are only capable of looking for the presence of Azo C, not quantifying the enzyme.  
 
Exposure to Azo Dyes Causes Protein Release 
 All results shown are from experiments with non-di viding cells, because the results from 
dividing and non-dividing cells were consistent. Th e exposure of certain azo dyes to C. 
perfringens caused a range of proteins (14 - 115 kDa) to be rel eased (Figure 34A). Interestingly, 
the azo dyes that caused protein release (Direct Bl ue 15, Ponceau BS, and Methyl Orange) 
produced similar protein profiles in their extracel lular fractions , whereas the control (buffer, no 
dye-exposure – Lane 2) and Methyl Red (Lane 6) expo sure did not produce protein release

 profiles, as seen in the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 34A).  This suggests that these specific azo dyes 
caused C. perfringens  to release proteins into the extracellular matrix.  Exposure to azo dyes also 
showed that sulfonated azo dyes are critical for th is protein release phenomenon. Direct Blue 15, 
Ponceau BS and Methyl Orange are all sulfonated azo  dyes whereas Methyl Red, the only non-
sulfonated azo dye tested, did not cause protein re lease (Figure 34A). The C. perfringens  ΔazoC  
mutant also showed a similar protein release profil e, thus demonstrating that the presence of the 
AzoC protein is not critical for the observed prote in release seen here (Figure 34B). 
Results indicate that the observed protein release following exposure to azo dyes (Figures 
34A and 34B) is not caused from cell lysis due to t he high viability of cells following azo dye 
exposure (>92%; Figure 34C). All extracellular samp les were found to be negative for LDH 
activity (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence) and all in tracellular samples were found to be positive 
for LDH activity (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence) (F igure 34C). Since LDH is a known 
intracellular enzyme in C. perfringens, these results demonstrate that the observed protein  release 
profiles were caused by the azo dyes and are not th e result of cell lysis (Korzeniewski & 
Callewaert, 1983; Shimizu  et al , 2002a). Protein release was also not due to cell membrane 
leakage, as the percentage of viable cells in the a zo dye-exposed samples was not statistically 
different than the percentage of viable cells in th e non-dye-exposed control (p-value >0.05, 95% 
confidence) (Figure 34C). Additionally, the cells w ere not forming endospores (Figure 34C). 
AzoC is Released Upon Azo Dye Exposure 
The release of AzoC was demonstrated by testing the  intracellular, periplasmic, and 
extracellular fractions of non-dividing cells expos ed to Direct Blue 15 (Figure 35). AzoC has 
previously been shown to be specific for Direct Blu e 15 (see Chapter 2) (Morrison  et al , 2014; 
Morrison & John, 2013; Morrison  et al , 2012). The specific detection of AzoC was confirm ed by 
Western blot using anti-AzoC antibodies (Figure 35) . Results suggest that AzoC is  127

 physiologically translocated from the cytoplasm to the periplasm regardless of azo dye exposure 
(Figures 35A and 35C). All periplasmic fractions (r egardless of exposure condition) showed the 
presence of AzoC in the periplasmic region both via  enzyme activity studies against Direct Blue 
15 (Figure 35A) and Western blotting (Figure 35C). The activity in the periplasmic fraction 
following control exposure was significantly higher  than in the Direct Blue 15-exposed cells (p-
value <0.001, 95% confidence). Extracellular releas e of AzoC does not occur until cells are 
exposed to sulfonated azo dyes, which is supported by subsequent enzyme activity against Direct 
Blue 15 and a positive reaction for AzoC on the Wes tern blot (Figures 35A and 35C). The control 
(no dye exposure) does not show enzymatic activity against Direct Blue 15 or extracellular AzoC 
on the Western blot (Figures 35A and 35C). The acti vity in the extracellular fraction following 
Direct Blue 15-exposure was significantly higher th an in the control-exposed cells (p-value 
<0.001, 95% confidence). A Western blot comparison of Wild type and ΔazoC mutant C. 
perfringens for the three fractions confirmed AzoC was not expr essed in the ΔazoC mutant 
(Figures 35C and 35D). The activity in the intracel lular fractions following either Direct Blue 15 
or control exposure were not significantly differen t (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). 
To determine whether exposure to specific azo dyes induced the release of an 
azoreductase specific for that azo dye, fractions t hat were generated following exposure to one 
azo dye were tested for enzymatic activity against another azo dye (Figure 35B). When non-
dividing C. perfringens cells  were exposed to Methyl Orange, only intracellular f ractions were 
able to reduce Methyl Orange (Figure 35B). It is hy pothesized that exposure to Methyl Orange 
did not cause the release of Methyl Orange-specific  azoreductase. However, the same Methyl 
Orange exposed extracellular fraction was able to r educe Direct Blue 15 (Figure 35B). Thus, a 
type of cross dye-enzyme event was observed in whic h the azo dye exposure from which proteins 
are released does not mean that the released protei ns can reduce that specific azo dye.

 AzoC Secretion is Sulfonation-Specific 
 As the mechanism of AzoC release was more closely examined, it appears as though 
sulfonation of the exposure compound was critical. Direct Blue 15, Ponceau BS, Methyl Orange, 
all sulfonated azo dyes, as well as sodium benzene sulfonate, a sulfonated non-azo dye, caused 
AzoC to be released (Figures 36A). However, Methyl Red, a non-sulfonated azo dye, as well as

et al , 2000; Patton, 2002; Westermeier & Marouga, 2005).  Therefore, these Western Blots are only capable 
of looking for the presence of AzoC, not quantifyin g the enzyme.

 the control buffer (no dye exposure), did not cause  proteins to be released (Figures 36A). 
Likewise, the extracellular supernatant following M ethyl Red exposure is not able to reduce 
Methyl Red (Figure 36B). However, the extracellular  supernatant following sodium benzene 
sulfonate exposure reduces Direct Blue 15 to the sa me degree that the extracellular supernatant 
following Direct Blue 15 exposure does (p-value >0. 05, 95% confidence) (Figure 36B). The 
presence of AzoC in all three sulfonated exposures was confirmed by a positive reaction for 
AzoC on the Western blot (Figure 36C). This suggest ed that sulfonation is key to protein release, 
with AzoC being one of the proteins that is release d. Similar protein release was seen with the C. 
perfringens ΔazoC mutant, however, AzoC was absent (from Western Blot s). 
AzoC Release is Both Dye Concentration-Dependent an d Time-Dependent 
Results from the time- and concentration-dependence  experiments showed a positive 
correlation between azo dye concentration and the p ercentage of dye reduction. Increased 
concentrations of Direct Blue 15 increased the perc ent azo dye reduction, until 100% azo dye 
reduction occurred (Figure 37). Specifically, at a 5 minute azo dye exposure, the increasing azo 
dye concentration showed an increase in the amount of dye reduced (Figure 37). A clear time 
dependence can also be observed for the concentrati ons tested until dye reduction reached steady 
state (Figure 37).  
Additional Azoreductases are Present in C. perfring ens 
A comparison between Wild type and ΔazoC  mutant  C. perfringens  in terms of their 
intracellular and extracellular fractions provided evidence for additional azoreductases  (Figure 
38). Specifically, exposure of the C. perfringens ΔazoC  mutant to Direct Blue 15 produced an 
azoreductase reaction against Direct Blue 15 in the  intracellular fraction. The presence of Direct 
Blue 15 reduction in the absence of AzoC, although significantly lower activity than in the same 
Wild type C. perfringens fractions (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence), suggeste d the presence of  131

additional azoreductases in the C. perfringens intracellular fraction that were capable of Direct 
Blue 15 reduction (Figure 38A and Figure 38B) . Additional evidence was seen while using 
Methyl Red, which is readily reduced when grown in C. perfringens cultures. Both Wild type and 
ΔazoC mutant  C. perfringens  intracellular fractions showed high activity again st Methyl Red, 
while the extracellular fractions did not have the ability to reduce Methyl Red (Figure 38C and 
Figure 38D). This suggested that the C. perfringens ΔazoC  mutant harbored active azoreductases 
specific for Methyl Red intracellularly, thereby su pport the presence of additional azoreductases 
in the cytoplasm of C. perfringens . Similar results were seen with intracellular frac tions from 
Methyl Orange-exposed C. perfringens ΔazoC mutant (Figures 38E and 38F). These additional 
azoreductases are predicted to be cytoplasmic only,  as the Gram-positive periplasmic region 
showed no significant azoreductase activity in both  the control and Direct Blue 15 exposed C. 
perfringens ΔazoC mutant (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence) (Figures 38E  and 38F).  132

 Discussion 
A successful gene knockout of the azoC gene has been completed, as shown by the 
Western blot in Figure 33B. AzoC is no longer a fun ctioning enzyme in the C. perfringens ΔazoC 
cells. Previous gene knockouts in C. perfringens have shown the introduction of an intron into a 
gene of interest via the Targetron kit (as utilized  here) are very stable and do not show any 
revertants back to the original genotype, due to th e genetic change occurring in the genome of the 
bacteria (Chen  et al , 2007; Chen  et al , 2005b; Gupta & Chen, 2008; Heap  et al , 2010a; Heap  et 
al , 2010b; Heap  et al , 2007; Li & McClane, 2008; Li & McClane, 2010).  
Commensal C. perfringens in the intestine can be exposed to a number of envi ronmental 
conditions (i.e. azo dyes), which can affect the pe rmeability of the cell envelope, leading to the 
secretion of proteins. A full understanding of whic h environmental conditions control protein 
release is important for understanding how C. perfringens functions physiologically within our 
bodies. To help achieve this, a study of the effect  of azo dyes on C. perfringens, with a particular 
focus on protein release, was conducted. 
The current study has demonstrated that the charged  groups on sulfonated azo dyes cause 
the release of AzoC and other proteins from the per iplasmic/cell wall region to the exterior of C. 
perfringens.  This phenomenon was shown to be sulfonation-specif ic (Figure 36); however, 
release is not reliant on the negative charge alone . For example, Methyl Red, typically thought of 
as a non-polar azo dye (pKa 4.8), is likely to have  its hydroxyl groups negatively charged at the 
pH tested in this study (pH = 7.5) (Yamanaka  et al , 1987). The sulfonated compounds tested 
(Direct Blue 15, Ponceau BS, Methyl Orange and sodi um benzene sulfonate) have pKa’s that also 
suggest that, at the pH tested, they would all have  negatively charged sulfonated groups as well 
(ChemAxon, 2014; Oakes & Gratton, 1998). However, o nly the sulfonated negative charges 
caused protein release. Also, protein release was n ot limited to azo dyes, as the non-azo 134 
 dye/sulfonated compound sodium benzene sulfonate, w as able to cause similar protein release 
(Figure 36). This suggests that the presence of a c harged sulfonated group drives protein release 
rather than the actual azo bond. In addition, this phenomenon is not caused by either cell lysis or 
cell wall leakage (Figure 34C). 
The charged nature of the sulfonated groups in the azo dyes and sodium benzene 
sulfonate as well as the charged nature of AzoC sup ports a possible ionic interaction with cell 
wall structures. This ionic interaction may result in neutralizing of the cell wall region, which 
could prevent proteins from ionic interaction with the now-neutral cell wall region, which would 
cause the release of proteins like as AzoC. Assumin g that the sulfonation-mediated AzoC release 
decreases the amount of constitutive AzoC present i n the cytoplasm, then it would be expected 
that less enzyme activity would be observed in the intracellular fractions of the azo dye exposed 
cells. Our results are consistent with this hypothe sis where in the Direct Blue 15-exposed 
intracellular fractions, Direct Blue 15 was fully r educed at approximately 7.5 minutes. In the non-
dye exposed control, the same reduction occurs in o nly 5 minutes (Figure 38A). Because faster 
azoreductase activity directly related to amount of  azoreductase present, it can be understood that 
the intracellular fractions of the control cells co ntain significantly more azoreductase than the 
intracellular fractions of the cells that have been  exposed to Direct Blue 15 (Morrison  et al , 
2012).  
Dye interaction with the cell wall was demonstrated  by showing a relationship between 
increasing azo dye concentration and azoreductase a ctivity in the extracellular fractions. Exposure 
to increasing concentrations of Direct Blue 15 corr elated with an increasing percentage of azo dye 
reduced, thereby supporting an azo dye concentratio n dependence for AzoC release into the 
extracellular fraction (Figure 37). Interestingly, at 200 μM Direct Blue 15 exposure 
concentration, the dye was reduced 100% for all exp osure time points, suggesting the cell wall 
ionic interacting binding sites were fully saturate d with dye, thereby maximizing the amount of 135 
 protein that was released. An interesting observati on supporting a steady-state phenomenon based 
on a simple diffusion process for the proteins was seen. Intracellular and extracellular enzyme 
activities for dye-exposed cells were always equiva lent which suggested that AzoC diffuses out 
of the cytoplasm until it reached equilibrium with the extracellular.     
There appears to be no correlation between a specif ic azo dye exposure and a specific 
azoreductase released. Methyl Orange exposure cause d proteins to be released, but the released 
proteins were not specific for azoreductase against  Methyl Orange (Figure 35B). Rather, these 
proteins were specific for azoreduction against Dir ect Blue 15 (Figure 35B). On the other hand, 
Direct Blue 15-exposed cells caused proteins to be released that were specific for Direct Blue 15 
(Figures 38A and 38E) (Morrison & John, 2013; Morri son  et al , 2012). 
The presence of additional azoreductase(s) in C. perfringens has been demonstrated. 
First, the presence of intracellular Direct Blue 15 -specific azoreductase activity in the C. 
perfringens ΔazoC mutant (in the absence of AzoC) strongly suggests t hat there are additional 
intracellular azoreductase(s) present in C. perfringens  that are also specific for Direct Blue 15 
(Figure 38B). Second, using the C. perfringens ΔazoC mutant, Methyl Red is not reduced by 
extracellular proteins but is reduced by intracellu lar proteins in the wild type and C. perfringens 
ΔazoC mutant (Figure 38D) . Third, the presence of proteins in the intracellula r C. perfringens 
ΔazoC mutant that was specific for Methyl Orange suggests  the presence of additional 
azoreductases (Figure 38E). These additional azored uctases appear to remain in the intracellular 
region and do not travel to the periplasm like AzoC  (Figures 38E and 38F). Further, we have 
searched the available contigs of the C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 genome, and have 
identified three additional putative azoreductases based on their sequence similarity to either 
AzoC, AzoM ( Enterococcus faecium ) or AzoR ( Escherichia coli ). 136 
 AzoC appears to localize to the Gram-positive perip lasmic region as seen in the Western 
blot using an anti-AzoC antibody (Figure 35C). It i s likely that surface proteins attached through 
ionic interaction to the peptidoglycan and/or wall-  or lipo-teichoic acids make-up the periplasmic 
space thereby enabling AzoC to localize to this reg ion. This observation begs the question as to 
how AzoC translocates across the cytoplasmic membra ne. It was observed that AzoC localizes to 
the periplasmic region both in the presence and abs ence of azo dye exposure (Figure 35C) 
suggesting that translocation is a normal physiolog ical event and not dependent on the presence 
of the azo dye.  
Interestingly, as previously discussed, AzoC does n ot contain a signal peptide sequence, 
which predicts AzoC to be an intracellular enzyme b y sequence alone (Morrison  et al , 2014; 
Morrison  et al , 2012). The translocation of proteins without a si gnal peptide sequence is not an 
uncommon phenomenon (Alam  et al , 2009; Bukau & Horwich, 1998; Cole  et al , 2005; Severin  et 
al , 2007; Shimizu  et al , 2002a; Shimizu  et al , 2002b; Walz  et al , 2007). In another C. perfringens 
strain (ATCC 13124) several predicted cytoplasmic p roteins (also by their sequence) were shown 
to actually be translocated surface proteins (Alam  et al , 2009). ESAT-6 secretions are known to 
support the secretion of proteins that do not conta in a signal peptide sequence (Pallen, 2002). 
ExPortal systems may also play a role but these hav e not been studied in C. perfringens (Rosch & 
Caparon, 2004).  
Despite the overwhelming support for translocated p roteins without signal peptide 
sequences, the mechanism by which these proteins ar e able to exit the cell without a signal 
peptide is yet known (Wickner & Schekman, 2005). Au thors have recently suggested piggy-
backing on proteins containing signal sequences as a possible mechanism of transport for non-
signal peptide proteins (Wickner & Schekman, 2005).  In E. coli,  environmental extracellular 
stress on the cell wall has been shown to cause pro teins to selectively escape from the 
intracellular space due to a stress response (Vazqu ez-Laslop  et al , 2001). Thus, despite not having 137 
 a signal peptide, it is possible that AzoC could tr anslocate to the periplasmic space by a non-
classical method.  
The physiological processes of cell division and pr otein release can be linked (Navarre & 
Schneewind, 1999). Specifically, there is evidence that the cell division process in Gram-positive 
bacteria is linked to important proteins associated  with the protein secretion machinery (Carlsson  
et al , 2006; DeDent  et al , 2008; Frankel  et al , 2010; Navarre & Schneewind, 1999). In 
Steptococcus pyogenes , it was found that pathogenically-important protei ns are directed to 
different locations in the cell envelope by specifi c signal sequences during the events of cell 
division (Carlsson  et al , 2006). In addition, in E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , only in 
actively-dividing cells were proteins released (Car lsson  et al , 2006). Research with 
Staphylococcus aureus has shown that the SecA secretion system (as oppose d to the TAT 
pathways) protein release during active cell divisi on is crucial in this important pathogen (DeDent  
et al , 2008). More recently, ABI domains (transmembrane proteins) have been linked to this 
process and identified as crucial for protein trans location during cell division (Frankel  et al , 
2010). Despite the literature link in cell division  being important for some protein translocation, 
we did not see the link here, as non-dividing cells  exposed to sulfonated compounds behaved in a 
similar manner to the actively dividing cells. 
 Overall, the outcome of the study supports the fol lowing hypothesis. The negatively-
charged sulfonated groups on the azo dyes compete w ith similarly charged azoreductases for 
positive charge sites in the cell wall. Thus, by sa turating the sites with azo dyes thereby creating a  
neutralizing region on the cell wall, AzoC efficien tly releases to the extracellular matrix. It is 
further hypothesized that there are other azoreduct ases that do not naturally translocate and have 
different dye specificities than AzoC. Lastly, we h ypothesize that most azo dyes are too large 
(molecular mass greater than 500 Da) and too polar to penetrate the cell wall, thereby the release 138 
 of some azoreductases is likely an adaptive mechani sm for C. perfringens in the intestine to be 
able to reach and reduce these dyes. A hypothetical  schematic model is shown in Figure 39.

predicting the interaction between sulfonated azo d yes and the C. perfringens  cell wall that results in the 
release of AzoC from the cell and into the extracel lular matrix. 
 
In conclusion, this study demonstrated how sulfonat ed negatively charged compounds 
such as azo dyes enable the release of proteins, in cluding AzoC, from the periplasmic space of C. 
perfringens strain ATCC 3626, resulting in an extracellular azo reductase reaction.

PRELIMINARY STUDIES ON THE GROWTH AND PHYSIOLOGY OF  CLOSTRIDIUM 
PERFRINGENS WILD TYPE AND ΔazoC KNOCKOUT MUTANT:                                       
AN AZO DYE EXPOSURE STUDY 
Abstract 
Clostridium perfringens , a strictly anaerobic microorganism and inhabitant  of the human 
intestine, has been shown to produce the azoreducta se enzyme, AzoC, an NAD(P)H-dependent 
flavin oxidoreductase. This enzyme reduces azo dyes  into aromatic amines, which are 
carcinogenic in nature. A significant amount of wor k has been completed which focuses on the 
activity of this enzyme, however, few studies have been done that focus on the physiology of azo 
dye reduction. Dye reduction studies coupled with C. perfringens growth studies in the presence 
of ten different azo dyes were completed to compare  the growth and activity of the C. perfringens 
Wild Type cells, the C. perfringens ΔazoC knockout mutant, and Bifidobacterium infantis, a non-
azoreductase-producing control bacteria. The presen ce of azo dyes significantly increased the 
generation time of C. perfringens in rich media, an effect that was not seen in minim al media. In 
addition, azo dye reduction studies with the ΔazoC knockout suggests the presence of additional 
functional azoreductases in this important bacteriu m.

 Introduction 
Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive, spore-forming strict anaerobic bacteria that is 
ubiquitous in nature, found in a variety of locatio ns such as soil and the human gastrointestinal 
tract (Ahmad  et al , 2010). The bacterium is considered a medically-im portant bacterium that is 
capable of causing a number of infectious diseases that include food poisoning, antibiotic-
associate diarrhea and gas gangrene (Ahmad  et al , 2010). Various strains of C. perfringens are 
known and they differ based upon the specific type of toxin(s) produced (Ahmad  et al , 2010). C. 
perfringens contains many genes and metabolic capabilities, one  of which is azoreductase activity 
(Morrison  et al , 2014; Morrison & John, 2013; Morrison  et al , 2012).  
Bacterial azoreductases are enzymes which are capab le of reducing azo dyes into their 
component amines (Levine, 1991). Azo dyes are commo n synthetic colorants which are used in 
many industries spanning foods and beverages to tex tiles and paper products (Chen, 2006; Chung 
& Cerniglia, 1992). Azo dyes possess a namesake azo  bond (-N=N-), which makes them capable 
of being reduced into their component aromatic amin es by the azoreductase enzyme (Stolz, 
2001). However, in many cases, these aromatic amine s have been found to be carcinogenic in 
nature (Rafii & Coleman, 1999). On top of them bein g a threat to human health, azo dyes are also 
frequently found as environmental pollutants, a res ult of industrial processing application (Chen, 
2006; Chung & Cerniglia, 1992; Stolz, 2001). 
The azoreductase of C. perfringens  strain ATCC 3626, AzoC, has been studied in the 
previous Chapters both biochemically and structural ly. What is lacking from the study, though, is 
a look at the physiology in terms of the effect of the azo dyes on C. perfringens , as well as the 
effect of AzoC on C. perfringens . To our knowledge, only one other physiological st udy has been 
completed for an azoreductase, which was with Enterococcus faecalis (Punj & John, 2008).   
 141 
 Investigation of the genome of C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 shows that this 
particular C. perfringens strain is significantly different than the other ge nome-sequenced C. 
perfringens  strains, including the well-studied strain 13. As calculated by the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the dendrogram fe aturing all genome-sequenced C. 
perfringens strains shows that C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 is located on a separate clade 
from C. perfringens strain 13, suggesting that the C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 is quite 
unique. Additionally, C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 has a much larger genome size comp ared 
to C. perfringens strain 13 (3.8Mb versus 3.0Mb), as well as many mor e genes and proteins (3710 
genes versus 2840 genes, 3301 proteins versus 2723 proteins). Additionally, the numbers for C. 
perfringens will only rise, as its genome sequence is not yet c omplete. 
The goals of this Chapter are to utilize an AzoC ge ne knockout mutant in C. perfringens 
strain ATCC 3626 to understand the effect of the Az oC enzyme on the bacteria, as well as to 
complete a physiological study to understand the ef fect of azo dye exposure to C. perfringens  
strain ATCC 3626.   
Materials and Methods 
Bacterial Strains, Media and Azo Dyes 
Clostridium perfringens strain ATCC 3626, both Wild Type and ΔazoC  knockout strains 
(see Chapter 5), and Bifidobacterium infantis strain ATCC 15697 were grown anaerobically in 
Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth (Difco Laboratorie s) at 37°C. B. infantis was used as a non-
azoreductase containing bacterial control for the e xperiments that follow. Clostridial minimal 
media (CMM) was prepared as previously detailed (Fu chs & Bonde, 1957). CMM consisted of 
the following at pH 7.0: Na 2HPO 4·12H 2O (6 g/L), KH 2PO 4 (1.5 g/L), NH 4Cl (1 g/L), NaCl (2.5 
g/L), MgCl 2 (0.1 g/L), FeCl 2 (0.7 g/L), glucose (4 g/L), adenine (10 mg/L), bio tin (0.4 μg/L), 
calcium pantothenate (200 μg/L), pyroxidine (800 μg /L), ascorbic acid (5 mg/L), L-tryptophan 142 
 (0.05 mM), and the following amino acids, all at 0. 5 mM ( DL -alanine, L-arginine, L-aspartic acid, 
L-cystine, L-glutamic acid, L-histidine, DL -isoleucine, L-leucine, DL -phenylalanine, DL -threonine, 
DL -tyrosine, DL -valine) (Fuchs & Bonde, 1957). Growth-arrest media  (phosphate-buffered saline 
with glucose, PBSG) was prepared as previously deta iled (Punj & John, 2008). PBSG consisted 
of the following, at pH 7.0: NaCl (137 mM), KCl (2. 7 mM), NaPO 4 (10 mM), KH 2PO 4 (2 mM), 
cysteine (600 mg/L), glucose (6 mM) (Punj & John, 2 008).  
Azo dyes used were purchased from the following com panies: Direct Blue 15 (MP 
Biomedicals), Methyl Red (Acros Organics), Tartrazi ne (Sigma-Aldrich), Trypan Blue (Kodak), 
Congo Red (Sigma-Aldrich), Eriochrome Black T (MCB) , Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A (Sigma-
Aldrich), Ponceau S (Fluka), Ponceau BS (Sigma-Aldr ich), Methyl Orange (Allied Chemicals). 
Their structures can be seen in Figure 4.   
Each individual azo dye was scanned prior experimen ting to determine the optimal 
absorbance for each dye in the reaction mixture (dy e absorbencies were above 340nm and 
extinction coefficients were used in determining th e concentration of the dyes at the conclusion of 
the reaction). The absorbencies for each azo dye te sted were as follows: Cibacron Brilliant Red 
3B-A (534.00nm), Congo Red (531.00nm), Direct Blue 15 (602.50nm), Eriochrome Black T 
(527.50nm), Trypan Blue (533.50nm), Methyl Red (430 .00nm), Tartrazine (425.00nm), Ponceau 
S (515.50nm), Ponceau BS (505.00nm), Methyl Orange (465.50nm). Dye concentration was 
interpolated from a plot of dye absorbance to time by making a standard curve of dye 
concentration to find the extinction coefficient. T he extinction coefficient was determined to be 
spectrophotometer-specific and dependent on a line of best fit. 
 
 
 143 
 azoC Gene Knockout  
As detailed previously in Chapter 5, the azoC gene in C. perfringens was inactivated by 
the insertion of a group II intron using the TargeT ron (Sigma-Aldrich) insertional mutagenesis 
system with a Clostridium -modified protocol and plasmid (Chen  et al , 2005b). The Sigma 
TargeTron algorithm (www.sigma-genosys.com/targetro n/) was utilized to identify optimal intron 
insertion sequence sites within the azoC gene sequence. An intron was targeted in the sense 
orientation between nucleotides 228 and 229 of the azoC open reading frame. Primers used for 
this process were: IBS (5’-AAAAA AGCTT ATAAT TATCC TTAAA GGACG CAGAT 
GTGCG CCCAG ATAGG GTG-3’), EBS1d (5’-CAGAT TGTAC AA ATG TGGTG ATAAC 
AGATA AGTCG CAGAT GGTAA CTTAC CTTTC TTTGT-3’), EBS2  (5’-TGAAC GCAAG 
TTTCT AATTT CGGTT TCCTT CCGAT AGAGG AAAGT GTCT-3’).  Following PCR to 
retarget the provided intron, the 350-bp fragment w as inserted into pJIR750ai to construct an 
azoC -specific TargeTron plasmid. This plasmid, pJIR750a iAzoC, was electroporated into C. 
perfringens (Gupta & Chen, 2008). Transformants were selected b y anaerobic growth on BHI 
agar plates containing 15 μg/mL chloramphenicol. Se lected transformants were grown in 10 mL 
anaerobic BHI cultures containing 15 μg/mL chloramp henicol and their genomic DNA was 
extracted using a Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Wiz ard). Following genomic DNA extraction, 
PCR was utilized to confirm the presence of intron insertion within the azoC gene by using 
AzoC-sequence specific primers: azoC- F (5’-CGGCC TCGAG ATGAA AGTAT TATTA 
GTTA-3’), azoC- R (5’-GTGAA AGGAT CCGCT GATTA AAATT AACTT TGATA TAT TT 
CAC-3’) (Chapter 2) (Morrison  et al , 2012; Wright, 2007). PCR was carried out in a MJ 
Research PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Cycler. Condi tions for amplification were as follows: 
one cycle of 2 minutes at 94°C, 25 cycles with each  cycle consisting of 1 minute at 94°C, 1 
minute at 55°C, and 1 minute at 72°C, and a final e xtension of 7 minutes at 72°C.  The PCR 
amplicon was observed by 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel ele ctrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. 144 
 Lack of AzoC protein expression by the AzoC deletio n mutant ( ΔazoC ) was confirmed by 
Western blotting.  
Bacterial Growth and Azo Dye Reduction by Whole Cel l Cultures 
Cultures of the bacteria ( C. perfringens Wild Type strain ATCC 3626, C. perfringens 
ΔazoC knockout mutant, or B. infantis ) were grown anaerobically, without shaking, overni ght at 
37°C in BHI. Each overnight culture (5 mL) was plac ed into a 100 mL anaerobic bottle of BHI. 
These larger cultures were allowed to grow until OD 600 =0.4 (log phase). Once log phase was 
reached, the bacteria were pelletted and resuspende d in the media (1 mL) to be used for the 
experiment (BHI, CMM or PBSG). The log phase bacter ia (1 mL) was placed into an anaerobic 
test tube containing 9 mL of the experimental media  and 20 µM of the azo dye of interest. All 
experiments were completed in triplicate. Initially  (t=0) and after every hour for 6 hours, and after 
24 hours, samples (1 mL) were taken from every tube . The 1 mL samples were centrifuged (5 
minutes at 10,000 x g at 4°C) to pellet the cells. The supernatant from the centrifugation 
(containing the azo dye) was scanned in a UV-1601PC  spectrophotometer at the wavelengths 
previously mentioned to be optimal for each dye to measure the dye reduction. This supernatant 
provides a measure of azo dye concentration and thu s reduction over time. The pellet from the 
centrifugation (containing the bacterial cells) was  resuspended in 1 mL sterile water and scanned 
at OD 600 to determine bacterial cell density. This resuspend ed pellet provides a measure of 
bacterial growth over time. The resuspended bacteri a cells were lysed with lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL 
final concentration) by incubation on ice for 30 mi nutes. Following incubation, cells were 
sonicated with a Sonic 300 dismembranator with a sm all tip and relative output of 60%. In total, 
10 sonication cycles occurred, with 5 seconds of so nication in each cycle, placing the sample on 
ice in between sonications. Following sonication, t he sample was centrifuged (30 minutes at 
10,000 x g, 4°C). The protein concentration in the supernatant (within the bacterial cells) was also 
determined following cell lysis by the Bradford met hod (Bradford, 1976).  145 
 To briefly summarize, each of the three bacterial s trains ( C. perfringens Wild Type 
ATCC 3626, C. perfringens ΔazoC knockout mutant, and B. infantis ) were tested with the 
previously mentioned ten different azo dyes and thr ee different media types of varying 
complexities. In addition, each experiment was perf ormed in triplicate and samples were taken 
after set-up (t=0) and at every hour for 6 hours (t =1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and after overnight incubation 
(t=24 hours). Each 1 mL sample taken provides a mea sure of dye absorbance, bacterial cell 
density, and protein concentration. 
Results  
Azo Dye Reduction 
 The results for the azo dye reduction by whole cel l cultures can be simplified by grouping 
the azo dyes together by those which have experienc e a significant change in dye reduction by the 
ΔazoC knockout mutant versus the Wild Type cells. 
First, Methyl Red (Table 10A), Methyl Orange (Table  10B), Tartrazine (Table 10D) and 
Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A (Table 10J) do not show  a statistically significant effect on dye 
reduction in the absence of the azoC gene ( C. perfringens ΔazoC knockout cells, p-value >0.05, 
95% confidence). In all four cases, the dye reducti on seen with the C. perfringens ΔazoC cells are 
not statistically different than what is seen with the Wild Type (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). 
This suggests that AzoC is not important for the re duction of these four dyes. In all three out of 
the four cases, this is also confirmed by the pure AzoC results, showing insignificant Methyl Red 
(Table 10A), Methyl Orange (Table 10B) or Tartrazin e (Table 10D) reduction by the pure AzoC 
enzyme (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). Additionall y, B. infantis does not show significant 
Methyl Red, Methyl Orange or Tartrazine reduction ( Table 10A, 10B, 10D), consistent with its 
role as a non-azoreductase producing control bacter ia (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). Cibacron 
Brilliant Red 3B-A shows significant reduction by A zoC, as well as B. infantis , suggesting that 146 
 non-enzymatic reduction is the cause (Table 10J) (p -value <0.05, 95% confidence). This has been 
previously reported with Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B- A (Morrison & John, 2013). In addition to 
comparing the Wild Type and ΔazoC knockout mutant, the three different media types ca n also 
be compared.

Pure AzoC a   99 ± 1.3             
a Pure AzoC % dye reduction was calculated with pure enzyme after a period of 15 minutes 
 
Methyl Red is significantly reduced by both the C. perfringens Wild Type and ΔazoC 
mutant in rich (BHI) media (Table 10A) (p-value <0. 05, 95% confidence). Within 3 hours, 60% 
of the dye added is reduced. This amount is reduced  when both C. perfringens strains are grown 
in minimal media (CMM), as in the same 3 hours only  23% of the dye is reduced. However, the 
cells that are grown in CMM recovers activity again st Methyl Red and by 5 hours has the same 
amount of dye reduced as in the rich media. This su ggests that, because growth is slower in the 
minimal media, the azoreductases are still being pr oduced, just at a reduced rate. The reduction 
rate is further reduced in the growth arrest media,  as after 24 hours only 34% of the dye is 
reduced. Because the C. perfringens  cells are not actively growing in the PBSG media, it can be 
reasoned that any dye reduction seen is the result of the already produced azoreductases. Thus, 
azoreductase production is constitutive in the C. perfringens cells.  
Methyl Orange is significantly reduced by both the C. perfringens Wild Type and ΔazoC  
knockout mutant cells in rich (BHI) media (Table 10 B) (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence). Within 
4 hours, 100% of Methyl Orange added is reduced. Th is amount is significantly reduced when the 152 
 C. perfringens cells are grown in minimal media (CMM), as in the s ame 4 hours only 65% of the 
dye is reduced (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence). The  cells that are grown in CMM slowly begin 
to recover activity but only achieves 84% Methyl Or ange reduction after 24 hours. Like with 
Methyl Red, this suggests that, because growth is s lower in the minimal media, the azoreductases 
are still being produced, just at a reduced rate. T he reduction rate is even further reduced in the 
growth arrest media (PBSG), as after 24 hours only 7.5% of the dye is reduced. Because these C. 
perfringens  cells are not actively growing the PBSG media, it can be reasoned that any dye 
reduction seen is the result of the already produce d azoreductases. Because Methyl Orange 
reduction is so reduced in the growth arrest media,  it could be that the azoreductase capable of 
Methyl Orange reduction is inducible, or that the m echanism by which enzyme meets dye is not 
functional in this growth arrest state in the Wild Type.  
 Tartrazine is significantly reduced by both the C. perfringens Wild Type and ΔazoC 
mutant in rich (BHI) media (Table 10D) (p-value <0. 05, 95% confidence). Within 3 hours, 57% 
of the dye added is reduced. This amount is initial ly reduced when both C. perfringens strains are 
grown in minimal media (CMM), as in the same 3 hour s only 33% of the dye is reduced. 
However, the cells that are grown in CMM recovers a ctivity against Tartrazine and surpass the 
activity of the cells grown in BHI. At 24 hours of exposure, the Tartrazine has been reduced by 
100% in both the Wild Type and ΔazoC mutant. This suggests that, because growth is slowe r in 
the minimal media, the azoreductases are still bein g produced, just at a reduced rate. The 
reduction rate is further reduced in the growth arr est media, as after 24 hours only 8% of the dye 
is reduced. Because the C. perfringens  cells are not actively growing the PBSG media, it can be 
reasoned that any dye reduction seen is the result of the already produced azoreductases. Thus, 
azoreductase production is not constitutive in the C. perfringens cells. 
 Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A is a unique case. Prev ious research has shown that this dye 
is subject to non-enzymatic reduction (Morrison & J ohn, 2013). The results presented in Table 153 
 10J serve to confirm this. In a very short period o f time (2 hours), Cibacron Brilliant Red is 
reduced 100% in the rich media (BHI) in both strain s of C. perfringens . In the minimal media 
(CMM), 100% dye reduction is also noticed, but at a  slower rate (4 hours). B. infantis , the non-
azoreductase-containing control bacteria shows a si gnificant reduction of Cibacron Brilliant Red 
3B-A as well, reaching 100% dye reduction in 5 hour s, suggesting that this dye is subjected to 
non-enzymatic reduction (p-value <0.05, 95% confide nce). 
The remaining six azo dyes, Eriochrome Black T (Tab le 10C), Ponceau BS (Table 10E), 
Congo Red (Table 10F), Ponceau S (Table 10G), Trypa n Blue (Table 10H) and Direct Blue 15 
(Table 10I) show a significant effect on dye reduct ion with the absence of the azoC gene (p-value 
<0.05, 95% confidence). In all six cases, the dye r eduction seen with the C. perfringens ΔazoC 
cells are significantly lower than what is seen wit h the Wild Type (p-value <0.05, 95% 
confidence). This suggests that AzoC is important f or the reduction of these six dyes. In all of the 
six cases, this is confirmed by the pure AzoC resul ts, showing strong Eriochrome Black T (Table 
10C), Ponceau BS (Table 10E), Congo Red (Table 10F) , Ponceau S (Table 10G), Trypan Blue 
(Table 10H) and Direct Blue 15 (Table 10I) reductio n by the pure enzyme (p-value <0.05, 95% 
confidence). Additionally, B. infantis does not show significant strong reduction of any o f these 
six dyes, suggesting that non-enzymatic reduction i s not the case (Table 10C, 10E, 10F, 10G, 
10H, 10I) (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). In addit ion to comparing the Wild Type and ΔazoC 
knockout mutant, the three different media types ca n also be compared for these six dyes. 
Eriochrome Black T is very slowly reduced by the C. perfringens Wild Type in rich 
(BHI) media (Table 10C). Within 24 hours, only 31% of Eriochrome Black T added is reduced. 
This amount is significantly reduced when the Wild Type is grown in minimal media (CMM), as 
in the same 24 hours only 27% of the dye is reduced  (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence). This 
suggests that, because growth is slower in the mini mal media, the azoreductases are still being 
produced, just at a reduced rate. Eriochrome Black T reduction is completely absent when in the 154 
 growth arrest media (PBSG) as significant dye reduc tion is not seen (p-value >0.05, 95% 
confidence). Because these Wild Type cells are not actively growing the PBSG media, it can be 
reasoned that any dye reduction seen is the result of the already produced azoreductases. Because 
Eriochrome Black T reduction is absent from the gro wth arrest media, it could be that the 
azoreductase capable of Eriochrome Black T reductio n is possibly inducible, or that the 
mechanism by which enzyme meets dye is not function al in this growth arrest state in the Wild 
Type. With Eriochrome Black T, a strong difference between the Wild Type and the  ΔazoC 
knockout mutant, as the Eriochrome Black T dye redu ction results for the ΔazoC mutant in either 
media type are significantly different than the Wil d Type (Table 10C) (p-value <0.05, 95% 
confidence). However, the reduction of the ΔazoC mutant seems to recover and catch up to that of 
the Wild Type, suggesting that there may be additio nal azoreductases that are capable of reducing 
Eriochrome Black T present. In addition, B. infantis does not show significant Eriochrome Black 
T reduction (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). 
Ponceau BS is very strongly reduced by the C. perfringens Wild Type in rich (BHI) 
media (Table 10E) (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence). Within 1 hour, 84% of the dye added is 
reduced. This amount is reduced when the Wild Type is grown in minimal media (CMM). 
However, the cells that are grown in CMM recovers a ctivity against Ponceau BS and by 4 hours 
has the same amount of dye reduced as in the rich m edia. This suggests that, because growth is 
slower in the minimal media, the azoreductases are still being produced, just at a reduced rate. 
The reduction rate is further reduced in the growth  arrest media, as after 24 hours only 28% of the 
dye is reduced. Because the C. perfringens  cells are not actively growing the PBSG media, it can 
be reasoned that any dye reduction seen is the resu lt of the already produced azoreductases. Thus, 
azoreductase production is constitutive in the C. perfringens cells. With Ponceau BS, a very 
strong difference between the Wild Type and the  ΔazoC knockout mutant is seen, as the dye 
reduction results for the ΔazoC mutant in either media type are significantly diffe rent than the 155 
 Wild Type (Table 10E) (p-value <0.05, 95% confidenc e). However, the reduction of the ΔazoC 
mutant seems to recover and catch up to that of the  Wild Type, suggesting that there may be 
additional azoreductases that are capable of reduci ng Ponceau BS present. In addition, B. infantis 
does not show significant Ponceau BS reduction (p-v alue >0.05, 95% confidence). 
Congo Red is very slowly reduced by the C. perfringens Wild Type in rich (BHI) media 
(Table 10F). Within 4 hours, only 38% of the Congo Red added is reduced; after 24 hours, this 
amount of dye reduced does not increase. This amoun t is the same as when the Wild Type is 
grown in minimal media (CMM), suggesting that the c hange from a rich to a minimal media does 
not affect Congo Red reduction. Congo Red reduction  is still present when in the growth arrest 
media (PBSG). Because these Wild Type cells are not  actively growing the PBSG media, it can 
be reasoned that any dye reduction seen is the resu lt of the already produced azoreductases. With 
Congo Red, a strong difference between the Wild Typ e and the  ΔazoC knockout mutant, as dye 
reduction results for the ΔazoC mutant in either media type are significantly diffe rent than the 
Wild Type (Table 10F) (p-value <0.05, 95% confidenc e). However, the reduction of the ΔazoC 
mutant seems to recover and catch up to that of the  Wild Type, suggesting that there may be 
additional azoreductases that are capable of reduci ng Congo Red present.  
Ponceau S is very strongly reduced by the C. perfringens Wild Type in rich (BHI) media 
(Table 10G) (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence). Within  2 hours, 100% of the dye added is reduced. 
This amount is reduced when the Wild Type is grown in minimal media (CMM), as it takes the 
cells grown in CMM 3 hours to reach the same comple te dye reduction. This suggests that, 
because growth is slower in the minimal media, the azoreductases are still being produced, just at 
a reduced rate. The reduction rate is further reduc ed in the growth arrest media. Because the C. 
perfringens  cells are not actively growing the PBSG media, it can be reasoned that any dye 
reduction seen is the result of the already produce d azoreductases. Thus, azoreductase production 
is constitutive in the C. perfringens cells. With Ponceau B, a significant difference bet ween the 156 
 Wild Type and the  ΔazoC knockout mutant is seen, as the dye reduction resul ts for the ΔazoC 
mutant in either media type are significantly diffe rent than the Wild Type (Table 10G) (p-value 
<0.05, 95% confidence). However, the reduction of t he ΔazoC mutant seems to recover and catch 
up to that of the Wild Type after an overnight incu bation, suggesting that there may be additional 
azoreductases that are capable of reducing Ponceau S present. In addition, B. infantis does not any 
signs of Ponceau S reduction (p-value >0.05, 95% co nfidence). 
Trypan Blue is strongly reduced by the C. perfringens Wild Type in rich (BHI) media 
(Table 10H) (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence). Within  5 hours, 100% of the dye added is reduced. 
This amount is significantly reduced when the Wild Type is grown in minimal media (CMM), as 
it takes the cells grown in CMM a full 24 hours to reach the same complete dye reduction (p-
value <0.05, 95% confidence). This suggests that, b ecause growth is slower in the minimal 
media, the azoreductases are still being produced, just at a reduced rate. The reduction rate is 
completely absent when the cell are grown in the gr owth arrest media. With Trypan Blue, a 
significant difference between the Wild Type and th e  ΔazoC knockout mutant is seen, as the dye 
reduction results for the ΔazoC mutant in either media type are significantly diffe rent than the 
Wild Type (Table 10H) (p-value <0.05, 95% confidenc e). However, the reduction of the ΔazoC 
mutant seems to recover and catch up to that of the  Wild Type after an overnight incubation, 
suggesting that there may be additional azoreductas es that are capable of reducing Trypan Blue 
present.  
Direct Blue 15 is strongly reduced by the C. perfringens Wild Type in rich (BHI) media 
(Table 10I) (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence). Within  4 hours, 100% of the dye added is reduced. 
This amount is significantly reduced when the Wild Type is grown in minimal media (CMM), as 
it takes the cells grown in CMM a full 24 hours to reach the same complete dye reduction; at the 
4 hours that the BHI-grown cells reach 100% dye red uction, the cells grown in CMM are only at 
a 33% dye reduction (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence) . This suggests that, because growth is 157 
 slower in the minimal media, the azoreductases are still being produced, just at a reduced rate. 
The reduction rate is nearly absent when the cell a re grown in the growth arrest media. With 
Direct Blue 15, a significant difference between th e Wild Type and the  ΔazoC knockout mutant is 
seen, as the dye reduction results for the ΔazoC mutant in either media type are significantly 
different than the Wild Type (Table 10I) (p-value < 0.05, 95% confidence). However, the 
reduction of the ΔazoC mutant seems to recover and catch up to that of the  Wild Type after an 
overnight incubation, suggesting that there may be additional azoreductases that are capable of 
reducing Direct Blue 15 present.  
In addition to looking at the percentage of each dy e reduced at different time points, a 
cumulative specific activity can be calculated for the total protein of the cell extracts for each of 
the strains tested in each media type.  
 Table 11 shows that, Methyl Red, Methyl Orange and  Tartrazine do not show a 
significant difference in specific activity when co mparing the C. perfringens Wild Type to the C. 
perfringens ΔazoC mutant in BHI, CMM, or PBSG (p-values >0.05, 95% co nfidence). This 
confirms the pure enzyme data as shown above, that AzoC is not important for the reduction of 
these three azo dyes. Table 11 also shows that Erio chrome Black T, Ponceau BS, Congo Red, 
Ponceau S, Trypan Blue and Direct Blue have signifi cant differences in specific activity when 
comparing the C. perfringens Wild Type to the C. perfringens ΔazoC mutant in BHI, CMM, or 
PBSG (p-values <0.05, 95% confidence).

Effect of Azo Dyes on Cell Growth 
Looking first at rich media (BHI), it can be seen t hat C. perfringens Wild Type has a very 
fast generation time of less than 10 minutes in the  absence of azo dyes (Figure 40A). The absence 
of the azoC gene ( C. perfringens ΔazoC  knockout mutant) does not have a significant effec t on 
generation time over the Wild Type in the absence o f dye, suggesting that AzoC does not play a 
role in basic growth processes (Figure 40A) (p-valu e >0.05, 95% confidence). In the absence of 
dye, the generation time of B. infantis is significantly higher than that of C. perfringens  at around 
20 minutes (Figure 40A) (p-value <0.05, 95% confide nce). Significant generation time effects are 
not seen in any case with B. infantis  in BHI media (Figure 40A) (p-value >0.05, 95% 
confidence).

the comparison of Wild Type with dye to the ΔazoC knockout with dye is significant (p-value <0.05, 95 % 
confidence). 
 
A) 
B) 160 
 When azo dyes are added to BHI, the situation chang es. Looking first at the effect of azo 
dye addition on the C. perfringens Wild Type cells, it can be seen that the addition o f Tartrazine, 
Methyl Red, Methyl Orange, Ponceau BS, Ponceau S, T rypan Blue and Direct Blue 15 all cause a 
significantly increased generation time over the no -dye containing BHI control media (p-value 
<0.05, 95% confidence) (Figure 40A). All 7 of these  dyes are highly reduced by C. perfringens 
Wild Type cells, suggesting dye-induced toxicity to  growth.  
For the C. perfringens ΔazoC knockout cells, the situation is slightly different . In this 
case, Tartrazine, Methyl Red and Methyl Orange expo sure for the C. perfringens ΔazoC knockout 
cells is no different than that of the C. perfringens Wild Type cells (p-value >0.05, 95% 
confidence) (Figure 40A). Both strains show approxi mately the same increased generation time 
(p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). However, for the a zo dyes which AzoC is known to reduce 
(Table 10), we see significant differences in the g eneration time changes in the C. perfringens 
ΔazoC knockout cells (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence). Pon ceau BS showed a huge increase in 
generation time for the Wild Type cells, but the ge neration time for the C. perfringens ΔazoC 
knockout cells is significantly decreased (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence) (Figure 40A). 
Additionally, Ponceau S, Trypan Blue and Direct Blu e 15 no longer show an increased generation 
time over the no-dye containing control BHI media, suggesting that, in the absence of the azoC 
gene, the increased generation time is no longer se en (Figure 40A). 
Looking at the minimal (CMM) media, it can be seen that the C. perfringens Wild Type 
has an increased generation time over what was seen  in the rich media (BHI), at around 13 
minutes (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence) (Figure 40A  and 40B). The absence of the azoC gene 
(C. perfringens ΔazoC  knockout mutant) does not have a significant effec t on generation time 
over the Wild Type in the absence of dye, confirmin g what was seen in the rich media, that AzoC 
does not play a role in basic growth processes (Fig ure 40B). In the absence of dye, the generation 
time of B. infantis is significantly higher than that of C. perfringens  at around 25 minutes (p-value 161 
 <0.05, 95% confidence) (Figure 40B). Significant ge neration time effects are not seen in any case 
with B. infantis  in BHI media (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence) (Figu re 40B). When azo dyes are 
added to CMM for the C. perfringens Wild Type cells, we surprisingly do not see the inc reased 
generation time that we saw in the rich (BHI) media  (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence) (Figures 
40A and 40B).  
As generation times are calculated during log phase , we can take a closer look at the 
increased generation time seen when azo dyes were a dded to BHI media, by breaking the 
generation time up into either an early log phase o r a late log phase to garner an idea of when the 
negative effect on generation time occurs. Table 12  shows that, in all cases where the azo dye and 
BHI media were shown to negatively affect generatio n time that the increase in generation time 
can be linked to late log phase.  
 In addition, for the azo dyes which were shown to negatively affect generation time in the 
Wild Type, but not in the ΔazoC mutant, as highlighted in Table 12, we can see that  the 
difference yet again comes during late log phase. F or example, Ponceau BS showed a 
significantly increased generation time with the Wi ld Type (~70 minutes), but was reduced in the 
ΔazoC mutant (~40 minutes). Looking at the fold increase for late log phase over early log phase, 
in the Wild Type this ratio is 54 whereas in the ΔazoC mutant this ratio is only 12.3, showing the 
significantly reduced effect of Ponceau BS on the m utant cells over the Wild Type (p-value 
<0.05, 95% confidence). Besides Ponceau BS, Ponceau  S, Trypan Blue and Direct Blue 15 also 
show significantly reduced generation time effects in the ΔazoC knockout (p-value <0.05, 95% 
confidence) (Table 12).

Discussion 
The goal of this Chapter was to utilize a ΔazoC knockout mutant in C. perfringens strain 
ATCC 3626 to understand both the effect of the AzoC  enzyme on the bacteria, as well as to 
complete a physiological study to understand the ef fect of azo dye exposure to C. perfringens  
strain ATCC 3626.   
AzoC appears to be not be important for the reducti on of Methyl Red, Methyl Orange, or 
Tartrazine. C. perfringens Wild Type cells are capable of strong dye reduction  of all three dyes 
(p-value <0.05, 95% confidence) (Table 10A, 10B, 10 D). However, in the C. perfringens ΔazoC 163 
 knockout mutant, the absence of AzoC does not have any effect on the dye reduction capability of 
the C. perfringens cells (p-values >0.05, 95% confidence) (Table 10A, 10B, 10D). This suggests 
that AzoC is not responsible for reducing these thr ee azo dyes. This is confirmed by looking at 
pure enzyme data from AzoC, which shows that AzoC i s not able to significantly reduce these 
three azo dyes under pure enzyme conditions (p-valu es >0.05, 95% confidence) (Table 10A, 10B, 
10D). Because C. perfringens cells are able to reduce these azo dyes quite readi ly, there must be 
other enzymes present which are capable of reducing  these azo dyes. 
On the other hand, AzoC appears to be principally r esponsible for the reduction of 
Eriochrome Black T, Ponceau BS, Congo Red, Ponceau S, Trypan Blue and Direct Blue 15. In all 
cases, the C. perfringens Wild Type cells were able to significantly reduce t hese dyes (p-values 
<0.05, 95% confidence) (Table 10C, 10E, 10F, 10G, 1 0H and 10I). When the azoC gene was 
knocked out, though, dye reduction was significantl y decreased compared to that of the Wild 
Type cells (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence) (Table 1 0C, 10E, 10F, 10G, 10H and 10I). This 
suggests that AzoC is primarily responsible for the  reduction of these azo dyes. The reduction of 
these azo dyes was not eliminated, however, but rat her slowed (Table 10C, 10E, 10F, 10G, 10H 
and 10I). In all cases, the dye reduction ability o f the C. perfringens ΔazoC knockout mutant was 
able, over time, to recover and reduce these azo dy es to the full amount that the Wild Type could 
(Table 10C, 10E, 10F, 10G, 10H and 10I). This sugge sts that, while AzoC appears to be primarily 
responsible for the reduction of these azo dyes, it  is not the only enzyme that can reduce these 
dyes. The results suggest that there is another enz yme (or enzymes) present that, upon exposure 
to the azo dyes, is able to be produced to recover the dye reduction ability for these azo dyes. 
Interestingly, it seems as though AzoC preferential ly reduces larger azo dyes, Eriochrome 
Black T, Ponceau BS, Congo Red, Ponceau S, Trypan B lue and Direct Blue 15, but does not 
break down the smaller azo dyes, such as Methyl Red , Methyl Orange and Tartrazine. Other 
azoreductases that have been studied, such as AzoR ( E. coli ) and AzoM ( E. faecium ), 164 
 preferentially reduce Methyl Red and Methyl Orange,  but do not reduce larger azo dyes (Chen  et 
al , 2004; Nakanishi  et al , 2001). Using the AzoC, AzoR ( Escherichia coli ) and AzoM 
(Enterococcus faecium ) nucleotide sequences, the known C. perfringens ATCC 3626 genome 
was analyzed by BLAST and three potential new azore ductase sequences were identified. The 
first, we will call AzoC2, is listed as a putative NADPH-dependent FMN reductase and shows a 
20% identity to the AzoC studied here. The second a nd third, called AzoC3 and AzoC4, are listed 
as flavodoxin family proteins and show 24-30% ident ity to AzoM and AzoR. AzoC3 and AzoC4 
share only 10% identity with the AzoC studied here and AzoC2, suggesting that they may be 
structurally and functionally unique when compared to the AzoC studied here and AzoC2. 
Overall, the coupled physiology study results with the genome BLAST results suggest that there 
are additional azoreductases present in C. perfringens strain ATCC 3626 that may be both 
structurally and functionally unique, supporting va riable dye specificities. The preliminary data 
here supports the need for additional protein studi es to fully understand the mechanism of all 
azoreductases in this important bacterium, as azore ductases may play an important role in the 
physiological response in C. perfringens.  
Cibacron Brilliant Red 3B-A appears to be a unique case for an azo dye amongst those 
tested here. Results with this azo dye suggest that  its reduction is favorable under any condition, 
including in a bacteria that is not capable of azo dye reduction ( B. infantis ). This, coupled with 
findings from Chapter 3, suggests that Cibacron Bri lliant Red 3B-A is strongly reduced under 
non-enzymatic conditions and its use as an azo dye for azoreduction testing should be taken with 
caution (Morrison & John, 2013).  
In almost all azo dye cases, the strongest dye redu ction activity was seen in rich media 
(BHI), while the minimal media (CMM) showed a slowe d dye reduction activity rate. This 
suggests that, because growth is slower in the mini mal media as compared to the rich media, that 
the azoreductases are still being produced, just at  a reduced rate as well. This is further 165 
 exaggerated by the growth arrest (PBSG) media, whic h shows dye reduction occurring at an even 
slower pace. Because the C. perfringens  cells are not actively growing the PBSG media, it can be 
reasoned that any dye reduction seen is the result of the already produced azoreductases. Thus, 
azoreductase production is constitutive in the C. perfringens cells.  
There is also a significant effect of azo dyes on C. perfringens growth. This phenomenon 
only seems to occur when the cells are grown in ric h media (BHI). In the case of Ponceau BS, the 
generation time is increased 7-fold as compared to Wild Type cells grown in the absence of the 
dye (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence) (Figure 40A). T he same increase is not seen when the cells 
are grown in minimal media (p-value >0.05, 95% conf idence) (CMM) (Figure 40B). From the 
dye reduction studies, it is shown that Ponceau BS is readily reduced by the C. perfringens Wild 
Type cells, so along with the Ponceau BS dye, there  are metabolites in the mix as well. It is 
hypothesized that, because rich media is undefined,  that there may be components of the media 
that are interacting with the dye metabolites, crea ting this increased generation time that is seen 
here. If this is the case, in the defined minimal m edia, it would be hypothesized that the increased 
generation time would not be seen, as is the case. Thus it is thought that the complex undefined 
media and its interaction with the specific azo dye  metabolites are what is causing the increased 
generation time. 
When the generation time is observed throughout log  phase, it is noticed that the 
increased generation time tends to occur during lat er log phase (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence) 
(Table 12). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the metabolites are interacting with the rich 
media. As time goes on, more metabolites are being produced to interact with the media, causing 
a build-up of products which in turn can cause a fu rther increase in generation time. In addition, 
B. infantis  does not show any generation time related effects in the presence of all of the azo dyes 
tested (p-value >0.05, 95% confidence). Because B. infantis  does not readily break down these 166 
 dyes, the hypothesis holds. Without the metabolites  present to interact with the rich media, the B. 
infantis  cells are unaffected. 
In addition to this, for the dyes which AzoC is cap able of reducing (Ponceau BS, Ponceau 
S, Trypan Blue, Direct Blue 15), we see that the in crease in generation time in rich media with 
the ΔazoC  mutant is significantly decreased over that of the  Wild Type (p-value <0.05, 95% 
confidence) (Figure 40A). This also supports the hy pothesis that the azo dye metabolites are 
interacting with the rich media to cause the toxici ty seen. These four azo dyes are readily reduced 
by the Wild Type. However, when the azoC  gene is knocked out, dye reduction is slowed 
significantly (p-value <0.05, 95% confidence), mean ing that fewer metabolites are produced for 
these azo dyes; less metabolites being produced can  equal less toxicity for the hypothesis 
previously stated. In addition, for these four azo dyes, the late log phase generation time effect is 
fold differences lower than that of the Wild Type ( Table 12). 
The azo dyes which show an increased generation tim e are Tartrazine, Methyl Red, 
Methyl Orange, Ponceau BS, Ponceau S, Trypan Blue a nd Direct Blue 15. All of these dyes have 
varying structures, degrees of polarity and sizes, making it difficult to understand why these azo 
dyes influence generation time, and not Eriochrome Black T, Congo Red or Cibacron Brilliant 
Red 3B-A. However, to date, azo dyes themselves hav e not been found to be toxic to 
microorganisms (Brown & Devito, 1993). It is also d ifficult to predict whether the increased 
generation time is coming from the azo dye, the met abolites, or further metabolic breakdown 
products, or a combination of any of the above with  the components of the undefined rich media 
(Brown & Devito, 1993). Additional research will ne ed to be completed to understand the 
mechanism that is increasing the generation time. 
 In conclusion, this study provides the first look at the physiology of C. perfringens upon 
azo dye exposure and the effect of the azo dyes on bacterial growth.  167 
 CHAPTER VII 
 
 
FINAL DISCUSSION 
Azo dyes are ubiquitous in nature, being found in i ndustries spanning foods and 
beverages to pharmaceuticals and textiles to cosmet ics. Azo dyes are constantly coming into 
contact with both our bodies and the environment. T he toxicity of the parent azo dyes is known 
and has been well-studied, especially those for hum an consumption. However, the enzymes that 
are capable of breaking these azo dyes down into ar omatic amines and the affect these dyes have 
on bacteria are not quite so black-and-white. Thus,  the study of azoreductase enzymes and azo 
dyes is important from both a human health and envi ronmental standpoint. 
Clostridium perfringens is a strictly anaerobic inhabitant of both the huma n 
gastrointestinal tract, as well as the environment and is thus a good candidate to study for this 
important enzyme. It has been confirmed here that C. perfringens does produce an azoreductase 
enzyme, with several other additional azoreductase enzymes proposed as well. This azoreductase 
enzyme, AzoC, is very different from other well-stu died azoreductases which originate from 
aerobic bacteria. Sequentially, the nearest neighbo r to AzoC shares only 13% identity. In 
addition, AzoC contains an FAD cofactor, whereas ot her azoreductases contain an FMN cofactor. 
Also, AzoC is trimeric in structure, being held tog ether by disulfide bonding, which is also unique 
amongst azoreductases. AzoC also has a distinctivel y different substrate preference in that it 
prefers to reduce larger, sulfonated azo dyes (i.e.  Direct Blue 15), whereas other azoreductases  
 168 
 have a preference for the opposite, smaller azo dye s (i.e. Methyl Red). In addition, AzoC has 
been found to function extracellularly. Despite the  large breadth of work presented here on AzoC, 
there is still much lacking from the field of azore ductase research in general. The major literature 
gap concerns a lack of information regarding the tr ue substrate of AzoC as well as other 
azoreductases. Because azo dyes have only been rece ntly introduced into our bodies and into the 
environment as anthropogenic pollutants, it is high ly unlikely that the true substrate of these 
enzymes is an azo dye, as there is only one natural ly occurring compound with an azo bond (4,4’-
dihydroxyazobenzene) (Stolz, 2001). Recent work wit h aerobic bacteria has shown dual 
functionality of azoreductase and quinone reductase  (Liu  et al , 2009; Ryan  et al , 2010). 
Therefore, it is likely that azoreductases have a l arger purpose, rather than azo dye reduction, as 
enzymes under the larger classification of oxidored uctase (a group of which azoreductase is 
included) have many different functions (Kultz, 200 5). 
The first dual function azoreductase/quinone reduct ase studied was AzoR of E. coli  (Liu  
et al , 2009). The researchers developed the idea that du al enzymatic function was present after a 
homology alignment of AzoR found significant homolo gy to structurally-known quinone 
reductases, such as ChrR of Pseudomonas putida (Liu et al , 2009).  In their 2009 manuscript 
detailing the dual functionality of the azoreductas e enzyme, the authors showed AzoR is 
specifically involved in the two-electron reduction  scheme of quinone reduction in which reactive 
oxygen species are linked to glutathione and excret ed (Liu  et al , 2009). They have linked this 
process, in E. coli, to the avoidance of oxidative stress by the creatio n of a mutant strain which 
showed significant impaired growth under the presen ce of quinones without the quinone 
reductase gene (Liu  et al , 2009). Because the overall mechanism for the elim ination of oxidative 
stress in C. perfringens is largely unknown to date, we hypothesize that a s imilar mechanism is 
present within this medically-relevant bacterium wh ich would largely contribute to the ability of 
C. perfringens to resist the oxidative stress of the host innate i mmune response, increase the 169 
 bacterial survivability and pathogenicity under thi s condition, as well as detoxify reactive oxygen 
species produced by fluoroquinone antibiotics, lead ing to the development of antibiotic 
resistance.   
General quinone reductase activity has been shown i n another Clostridium species, C. 
tyrobutyricum (Petitdemange et al,  1980).  Despite this lack of information on a quinone reduc tase 
in C. perfringens , a BLAST of the available genome shows that this i mportant bacterium contains 
genes required to support the quinone reductase act ivity such as a glutathione biosynthetic system 
that is capable of producing glutathione to detoxif y and eliminate reactive oxygen species 
(Copley & Dhillon, 2002; Fahey  et al , 1978; Kino  et al , 2007). Specific genes identified include 
the glutathione gamma glutamyl cysteine synthetase,  glutathione synthetase peroxidase and 
glutamate cysteine ligase. Initial studies within t he laboratory suggest that AzoC possesses the 
ability to reduce quinone compounds (menadione, law sone, 1,4-naphthoquinone, 2,6-
dichloroquinone and 1,4-dihydroxynaphthalene), as m easured by the oxidation and subsequent 
loss of signal at 430nm for NADPH. 
The possible role of azoreductase enzymes in stress  response has also been supported by 
a recent transcriptomics analysis looking at the tr anscriptomes of enterohemorrhagic E. coli 
O157:H7 under many different environmental conditio ns (Landstorfer  et al , 2014). Specifically, 
the authors found that the azoreductase gene of E. coli (AzoR) was upregulated when found on 
radish sprout roots (Landstorfer  et al , 2014). The authors suggested the role of this enz yme in 
stress response, specifically as an enzyme involved  in the detoxification of secondary plant 
metabolites (Landstorfer  et al , 2014).  
In conclusion, although much has recently been disc overed about azoreductases and 
AzoC, much is still yet to be discovered in the fie ld. The upcoming discoveries may prove to be 
the most beneficial to human and environmental heal th. 170
