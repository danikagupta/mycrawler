SUMMARY: This paper describes the remova l of fluoride (F) from water using the
water fern species Azolla filiculoides . This study took the form of empirical
laboratory-based research. The Azolla  plants were gathered and dried in an oven at
105ºC for 24 hr. The effects of pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, and F concentration
were investigated. The concentration of F was measured using a spectrophotometer
in wavelengths of 570 nm. The isothe rms and kinetics of adsorption were
determined. The results showed that re moval efficiency decreased with increasing
pH and that the optimum pH w as 5. The removal efficiency of Azolla  was increased
by increasing the adsorbent dose and co ntact time, and decreasing the initial
concentration of F. The data fitted well with the Langmuir Model isotherm. There wasgood correlation with pseudo -second-order kinetics for the absorption of F by
biomass. The results indicated that modified Azolla filiculoides can be used
successfully as an effective adsorbent for F removal.
Keywords: Adsorption isotherm; Adsorption kinetic; Azolla filiculoides ; Fluoride adsorption.
INTRODUCTION
Fluoride (F) is not an esse ntial element, may adversel y affect human health, and
the maximum level recommended in drinking water by the World HealthOrganization (WHO) is 1.5 mg/L.
1-2 Many studies have been done regarding F
and its relation to health and the environment.3-5 Any excess F must be removed
from drinking water. Several techniques have been investigated to remove F fromwater, such as reverse osmosis, nanof iltration, ultrafiltration, electrodialysis,
donnan dialysis, ion exchange, and adsorption.
6-8 Of these, adsorption is a widely
used method due to its several benefits9,10 with activated car bon being the most
widely used adsorbent. Finding a low-co st and effective adsorbent is a current
concern across the world11 with particular interest being taken in biosorbents for
pollutant removal.12 Azolla filiculoides  is one such biosorbent. It is a water fern
that contains blue-green algae and is  found in slow-moving streams and ponds.13-
15 It grows rapidly, forming dense mats over the water surface, which can have
negative effects on aquatic life.16 Azolla  in both dried and living form has been
used effectively to remove heavy metals, dyes, and phenol compounds fromaqueous solutions.
17-20 The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability
of modified Azolla filiculoides  to adsorb F from aqueous solutions and to apply

kinetic modeling and isotherms. The influence of various parameters, including
pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, and F concentration, were investigated. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Azolla plants were collected from a rice paddy in the city of Sari, Iran, and dried
in the oven at 105ºC for 24 hr. It was crushed and sieved into particles ranging insize from 1 to 2 mm. The biomass was treated  with 0.1 M HCl for a period of five
hr after which it was washed with distilled water and dried in the shade.

The specific surface area of the adsorben t was determined by the BET method
using a Gemini 2357 surface area an alyzer (Micromeritics Instrument
Corporation, USA). Scanning electron micr oscopy (SEM) was carried out using a
scanning microscope (Phili ps, Eindhoven) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-
ray (EDX). The FT-IR spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm-1 using
a Nicolet 5700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) to gather dataon the bending vibrations and stretchi ng of the functional groups that are
responsible for the adsorption process.
Sodium fluoride (NaF) was used to  prepare the F solution. The batch
experiments were carried out in 250 mL  Erlenmeyer flasks (Meyer). Previous
research has shown that the most effectiv e variables on the adsorption process are
pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, and poll utant concentration. The initial range of
F concentration was 1 to 100 mg/L. The effect of the adsorbent dose (0.2–1.2 g),contact time (5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, and 180 minutes), and pH (3, 5, 7, 9,and 11) were investigated. 
In each experiment, a particular volu me of F solution with a particular
concentration was added to an Erlenmeyer  flask and a particular adsorbent dose
added. The solution was mixed with shaker at 180 rpm for 60 min. The sampleswere then centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 10 min. The data were analyzed using SPSS16 statistics software. The standard curv e was provided by using the different
concentrations of F, prepared from stock solution (100 mg/L). The pH wasregulated by 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M NaOH. For the measurement of the F, 1 mL ofZrOCl
2.8H2O and 1 mL SPADNS F reagent solu tion were added to the prepared
samples and each measured by spectrophotometer in λman=570 nm.18 The
equilibrium adsorption capacity was cal culated using the following equation: 18
Where Co, Ce (mg/L) are the initial and the equilibrium concentration of F, qe
(mg/g) the amount of F adsorbed at eq uilibrium, M (g) the adsorbent mass, and V
(L) the volume of solution.
The experiments to determine the adsorp tion isotherms were performed with an
adsorbent amount of 10 g/L at pH 5. The important parameter in designing theabsorption system is the prediction of the adsorption capacity. This can be
obtained by analyzing the isotherm data. The obtained data were fitted on the first-and second-order models to find the best chemical removal model for describing

the experimental kinetic data. The equati ons of isotherms and kinetics are shown
in Table 1.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The specific surface area is related to the number of active adsorption sites of
dried A. filiculoides . Adsorption increased with in creased specific surface area and
pore volume of the adsorbent. Th e specific surface area of modified Azolla  was
determined to be 36 m2/g indicating that the modified Azolla  had a relatively good
ability to remove the pollutants.
SEM images were used to analyze the surface structure of A. filiculoides
(Figures 1 and 2). Table 1.  The equations of isotherms and kinetics.18

It was found that the adsorbent had a heterogeneous surface structure with deep
pores. The elemental composition analysis  showed that the adsorbent in the
sample contained: C (57.57%), O (35.7%),  Ca (4.40%), Mg (1.2%), K (0.075%),
Cl (0.017%), and Al (0.045%) (Figure 3).
To understand the interaction between fu nctional groups on the surface of dried
A. filiculoides  and fluorine cations, samples of dried A. filiculoides  both before and
after use were examined using FT-IR sp ectroscopy. As shown in Figures 4 and 5,
the dried A. filiculoides  both before and after use showed a similar pattern and the
same number of observed peaks in the FT-IR spectra. Intense absorption peaks at
around 3410–3430 cm-1 correspond to the O–H stretching vibrations due to inter-
and intra-molecular hydrogen bonding of polymeric compounds, thus showing the
presence of ‘free’ hydroxyl groups on the adsorbent surface. The peaks at 2928
cm-1 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric C–H stretching vibration of
aliphatic acids. The peak observed at 1744 cm-1 is the stretching vibration of
bonds due to non-ionic carbo xyl groups (–COOH, –COOCH3), and may be
         20 µm

assigned to carboxylic acids or their esters. The peaks at 1638 and at 1413–1418
cm-1 are due to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of C=O in ionic
carboxylic groups (–COO–). Aliphatic acid group vibration at 1262 cm-1 may be
assigned to the deformation, vibration of C=O and stretching formation of –OH.

6 g/L and an initial F concentration of 10 mg/L. The effect of contact time on F
removal efficiency is shown in Figure 6. 
The removal efficiency increased with an increase of contact time up to 75
minutes. This is known as equilibrium time. The removal rate in the early part ofprocess was observed to be faster, which is consistent with several otherstudies.
21,22 This is probably due to the la rge available surface area of the
adsorbent at beginning of the adsorpti on process. The F removal efficiency at
equilibrium time was 98%.
The effect of pH on F removal effici ency was investigated by varying the pH
between 3 and 11 (Figure 7). Figure 6. The effect of contact time on fluoride removal efficiency. The figure shows the %

Maximum F removal was obtained at pH 5, which concurs with several previous
studies.22,23 At pH levels above 5, the adso rption capacity decreased. This is
probably due to inappropriate surface char ge and competition for adsorption sites
because of the excess of anions in alkaline conditions.21 However, there is no
significant difference in the percentage of F removal between pH 3 and 5, beingonly 2%. 
The effect of initial F concentration was investigated by varying the
concentration range between 1 and 100 mg/L. The relationship between initial Fconcentration and removal efficiency is shown in Figure 8.
 The removal efficiency decreases with increasing F concentration. This is
thought to be because there are not enough  available active sites on the adsorbent
surface in comparison with the large number  of active sites which are required for
a high concentration of F.
24 Removal efficiency increases up to a concentration of
10 mg/L and then decreases as concentrat ion rises. This concurs with several
previous studies.6,21
The impact of the adsorbent dose on F removal efficiency was investigated by
varying the adsorbent dose between 2 and 14 g/L using an initial F concentrationof 10 mg/L and a contact time of 75 min.  The effect of the adsorbent dose on F
removal is shown in Figure 9. It was obs erved that F removal efficiency increases
on increasing the adsorbent dose. Ho wever, the adsorption capacity (q
e) decreases.
The maximum F removal efficiency was ob tained at an adsorbent dose of 6 g/L,
and there was no significant difference in removal percentage in levels higher than
8 g/L. This concurs with other studies10,25 and may be due to the overlapping of
active sites of the adsorbent at higher dosages.6, 21

The obtained values of these isotherm s and kinetics are presented in Table 2.
 The results of the isotherm study indicate that although the value of R2 for most
models is more than 0.9, the F adsorp tion isotherm most closely followed the
Langmuir Model with R2=0.998. Kinetics of adsorption were well described by
the pseudo second-order model. The results of this study are consistent with otherstudies.

CONCLUSION
F removal in the study was found to be 98%. This indicates that modified Azolla
can be used as an effective and inexpens ive adsorbent for F removal. The removalFigure 9. The effect of adsorbent dose on fluoride removal efficiency. The figure shows the %
