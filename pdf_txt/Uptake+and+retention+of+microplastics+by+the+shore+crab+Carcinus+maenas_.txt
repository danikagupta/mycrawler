ACS Paragon Plus EnvironmentEnvironmental Science & TechnologyAbstract 19 
Microscopic plastic debris (microplastics, <5mm in diameter) is ubiquitous in the marine environment. 20 
Previous work has shown that microplastics may be in gested and inhaled by the shore crab Carcinus maenas  21 
although the biological consequences are unknown. H ere, we show that acute aqueous exposure to polysty rene 22 
microspheres (8µm) with different surface coatings had significant but transient effects on branchial function. 23 
Microspheres inhaled into the gill chamber had a sm all but significant dose dependent effect on oxygen  24 
consumption after 1 hour of exposure, returning to normal levels after 16 h. Ion exchange was also aff ected, 25 
with a small but significant decrease in hemolymph sodium ions and an increase in calcium ions after 2 4 h 26 
post exposure. To further asses the effects on osmo regulation, crabs were challenged with reduced sali nity 27 
after microplastic exposure. Neither microspheres n or natural sediments altered the crab’s response to  osmotic 28 
stress, regardless of plastic concentration added. Carboxylated (COOH) and aminated (NH 2) polystyrene 29 
microspheres were distributed differently across th e gill surface, although neither had a significant adverse 30 
impact on gill function. These results illustrate t he extent of the physiological effects of microplas tics, 31 
compared to the physiological resilience of shore c rabs in maintaining osmoregulatory and respiratory 32 
function after acute exposure to both anthropogenic  plastics and natural particles.   33 Page 3 of 15
ACS Paragon Plus EnvironmentEnvironmental Science & Technology1. Introduction 34 
Microplastics (plastic particles <5 mm)1 are an emerging environmental problem, and have be en accumulating 35 
in coastal habitats for at least four decades.2 Microplastics come from sewage releases of microbe ads added to 36 
cosmetic product to give exfoliation properties, pa ints, coatings and industrial pellets and from the breakdown 37 
of larger plastics.3 This second source is enhanced by abiotic processe s such as wave action, UV degradation 38 
and general heat stress, and by biological transfor mation. For example, the shore crab Carcinus maenas  is able 39 
to break down any microscopic rope fibres that it h as ingested through the gastric mill digestive proc esses.4 40 
Ingestion of microplastics has been documented in o ver 200 marine and aquatic species .5 Polystyrene 41 
microspheres (0.4−30.6 µm) have been found to be co nsumed by numerous organisms such as zooplankton,6, 7  42 
filter feeding molluscs 8 and scavenging decapod crustaceans 9, 10 . Most of these studies have concentrated on 43 
the uptake of microplastic by ingestion and the pot ential for feeding activity to then be disrupted. F or example, 44 
Wright et al. 11  showed depletion of energy reserves of up to 50% i n lugworms ( Arenicola marina) cultured for 45 
up to a month in sediment spiked with polyvinylchlo ride (PVC), an effect attributed to reduced feeding 46 
activity. Similarly, a decrease has been reported in  the energy available for growth in C. maenas  when 47 
consuming plastic contaminated food. 4 48 
Shore crabs are omnivores and frequently feed on biv alves such as the common blue mussel Mytilus edulis. 49 
Trophic transfer experiments  9, 10  have shown that crabs can ingest microplastics fro m contaminated mussels, 50 
leading to a reduced allocation of energy for growt h.4 Crabs can also take up microplastics by ventilation  into 51 
the gill chambers,10  where they may remain for up to 22 days. Most micr oplastics in C. maenas  are found 52 
adhered to the posterior gills, which are a known m ajor site for ion regulation.12  The emerging paradigm is 53 
that ingestion of microplastic can reduce fitness i n marine species by altering their food consumption  and 54 
energy allocation.13  The purpose of this paper is to assess whether ins piration of microplastic through the 55 
ventilatory mechanism can also reduce fitness.  56 
In aquatic organisms gills are the main site for ga seous and ionic exchanges, and acidábase balance.14  57 
Therefore, any factor such as microbial growth 15 , or contaminants 16  impairing gill function might have 58 
detrimental consequences for the organism. Exposure  to marine contaminants such as 59 
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane  (DDT), arsenite, cadmium, silver, copper, and merc ury have, in fact, been 60 
reported to have detrimental effects for osmoregula tion and ion exchange.17  Although the uptake and retention 61 
of microplastics across the gill surface have been documented,10  the potential effects on the crab’s gaseous 62 
exchanges and ability to ion and osmoregulate, have  not been evaluated to date.  63 
Since microplastics are retained on the gills of C. maenas , we hypothesized that acute exposure to waterborne  64 
plastic microspheres could significantly impact oxy gen uptake, ion exchange, and osmoregulatory capaci ty of 65 
crabs. We tested this hypothesis by determining the  impact on crabs of an acute 24 h exposure to polys tyrene 66 
microspheres of diameter 8 µm. We chose polystyrene  because it is a frequent feature of marine debris,  and 67 
previous experiments have confirmed this size range  to be retained within the outer surface of the gil l 68 
lamellae. We also tested two further types of polys tyrene with different surface coatings (carboxylate d 69 Page 4 of 15
ACS Paragon Plus EnvironmentEnvironmental Science & Technology(COOH) and aminated (NH 2)), to compare the influence of surface composition  on biological accumulation 70 
and effects. We measured the crab’s ion regulation and respiratory processes, in the presence and abse nce of a 71 
low salinity challenge.  72 
Methods 73 
Aquarium procedure 74 
Nonáovigorous (without eggs) and intermoult female shore crabs ( Carcinus maenas ) were collected from the 75 
Exe estuary, Devon, UK (50°35.2′N, 3°23.59′W), and kept for 2 weeks in full strength (33 ppt) Artifici al Sea 76 
Water (ASW) to acclimatise to aquarium conditions ( 14.5 oC, 12h:12h light: dark cycle). Crabs were fed for 77 
12 days every other day with frozen mussels Mytilus edulis , and then starved for 2 days prior to the 78 
experiments. Crabs were transferred to individual 5  L tanks filled with 2 L ASW with an air stone used  to 79 
keep the partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2) close to 100 % saturation. Crabs were left to acc limate to this 80 
experimental set up overnight. The next morning mic roplastic (8 µm polystyrene microspheres, Spherotec , 81 
neutral, carboxylated or aminated) or natural sedim ent (ca. 28 µm, concentration 10 6 Lá1) was added. Plastic 82 
was added at two experimental concentrations (10 6 and 10 7 microspheres L á1) with a set of crabs held in 83 
identical conditions without plastic to act as the controls. These concentrations were chosen to emula te the 84 
acute exposures in Watts et al. 10 . Oxygen consumption was determined at 1 h, 16 h an d 24 h after the addition 85 
of plastics. At the end of the last oxygen consumpt ion determination, a 500 µL heamolymph sample was 86 
taken. Samples were taken from the base of the 3 rd  walking leg using an ice cooled 1 mL syringe.18  A 87 
subsample of heamolymph was immediately transferred  to a clean ice cold 1.5 mL tube, from where 10 µL 88 
were taken and diluted in 4 mL of milliáQ water (<1 8 MΩ; Millipore Advantage 10 UV; Thermo Fisher 89 
Scientific), vortexed and stored at á20 oC for later ion analysis. The remaining heamolymph was then 90 
centrifuged at 8000 g for 2 minutes. Subsequently, a  second subsample of 5 µL was diluted in 200 µL of 91 
ultrapure water (1:40 dilution) for later haemocyan in concentration. The remainder was mixed with 92 
anticoagulant (450 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 0 mM EDTAáNa 2, pH 7.3, 850 mOsm kg á1) at 93 
3:1 ratio, vortexed and stored at á20  oC for later analysis. Hemolymph osmolality was dete rmined in a vapour 94 
pressure osmometer (Wescor 5520; Wescor Inc., South Logan, UT, USA). 95 
For salinity challenge experiments, crabs were trea ted as above, but a further group was subsequently 96 
transferred into clean tanks containing ASW of redu ced salinity (10ppt). Oxygen consumption and water 97 
samples for ammonia were taken at 1, 6 and 24h post  salinity challenge. At 24 h post treatment, 500 µL  98 
heamolymph was sampled and treated as above. 99 
Coherent Raman Scattering Microscopy. 100 
Coherent Raman scattering microscopy (CRS) is a mult iphoton microscopy technique that provides labeláfr ee 101 
contrast of both the target sample and surrounding biological matrix, based on vibrational spectroscop y. The 102 
applications of CRS range from medical research,19  to more recent usage in ecotoxicology.20  Plastics have 103 
previously been successfully imaged using the CRS te chnique, in zooplankton 6 and in crab gills 10 . For a more 104 
detailed explanation of the theory behind CRS imagin g of biological samples see Goodhead et al 20 . Briefly, 105 Page 5 of 15
ACS Paragon Plus EnvironmentEnvironmental Science & TechnologyRaman scattering provides a great deal of chemical information by examining the light that is scattere d by 106 
molecular vibrations. Raman scattered light is emit ted at a slightly shifted wavelength with respect t o the 107 
incident light, the shift in energy corresponding t o the vibrational frequency of a molecular bond wit hin the 108 
sample. The CRS process involves two lasers where t he frequency of the first laser is constant, while the 109 
frequency of the second one can be tuned in a way t hat the frequency difference between the two lasers  equals 110 
the frequency of the Ramanáactive or vibrational mo de of interest. The molecules in resonance produce a 111 
larger signal than those off resonance, providing a  vibrational contrast in a CRS image. Here six crab s were 112 
exposed to nonálabelled polystyrene spheres with di fferent surface characteristics (three with carboxy l groups; 113 
three with amino groups) at a concentration of 1 x 10 5 spheres L á1 for 19h. Posterior gills were dissected fresh 114 
and analysed with CRS microscopy.  115 
Oxygen consumption 116 
Oxygen consumption was assessed by closed respirome try. Briefly, air was switched off and initial diss olved 117 
oxygen was determined and reámeasured after 1 h. Th e air was then switched back on. Six supplementary 118 
tanks (not containing crabs) with 2 L ASW (either 1 0 or 33 ppt) were used as controls to measure oxyge n 119 
diffusion from the air water interface or bacterial  oxygen consumption. The exact time the air was swi tched 120 
off, oxygen measured and air switched back on was r ecorded for each tank. For full salinity experiment s (33 121 
ppt) oxygen was assessed in ~0.5 mL via a Strathkelv in oxygen electrode connected to a 781 oxygen meter . 122 
The oxygen electrode was housed in a water jacket, irrigated with water at the same temperature as the  crabs 123 
(14.5 oC). For the salinity challenge experiments, dissolv ed oxygen was assessed using a needle type fiber 124 
optic sensor (Firesting OXR 230) connected to a FSO2 á4 optical oxygen meter. Oxygen electrodes were 125 
calibrated daily with fully aerated water (100% oxy gen saturation) and a saturated sodium sulphite sol ution 126 
(0% oxygen saturation). To avoid compensatory respo nses associated with depleted dissolved oxygen 127 
concentrations, the chamber PO2 values were always in excess of ~120 mmHg (~15.5 k Pa). Oxygen 128 
consumption was calculated as the difference in wat er oxygen content over time and displayed in ml O 2 gá1 há1. 129 
Haemocyanin and protein in the heamolymph  130 
 A 5 µL subsample of heamolymph was added, per trip licate, to a 96 well plate followed by addition of 200 131 
µL of milliáwater and mixed for 45 sec. The absorba nce at 335 nm was measured with path length correct ion 132 
on a plate reader (Tecan, NanoQuant Infinite M200 Pr o). Oxyáhaemocyanin concentration was determined 133 
using an extinction coefficient (ε) of 17.26 calcul ated on the basis of a functional subunit of 74,000  Daltons 134 
for crabs.21  Protein in the heamolymph was quantified via Bradfo rd 22 , using a bovine serum albumin standard 135 
curve.  136 
 137 
Ions 138 
Haemolymph Na +, K + and Ca 2+  were quantified in the diluted samples (10 µL in 4  mL) via flame photometry 139 
(Sherwood Instruments). Standard curves were construc ted using 1 mM solutions of NaCl, KCl and CaCl.  140 
Statistics 141 Page 6 of 15
ACS Paragon Plus EnvironmentEnvironmental Science & TechnologyTo test if the microplastic treatment or the salini ty challenge explained the variation observed in th e 142 
physiological parameters, a General Linear Model (G LM) was performed followed by a Tukey post hoc test  143 
when the GLM was significant. Parametric assumption s of normality of residuals and homogeneity of 144 
variances was met. The GLM and post hoc analysis wa s performed in MINITAB. A repeated measures 145 
ANOVA (Sigma plot) was used to determine differences  in oxygen consumption over time. Differences were 146 
considered significant at a p ≤ 0.05. 147 
 148 
Results  149 
No mortalities were found during or after any of th e experimental treatments. Furthermore, no evident changes 150 
in behaviour were noted in any of the plastic treat ments.  151 
Uptake of carboxylated and aminated polystyrene mic roparticles 152 
All (6) crabs sampled for Coherent Raman scattering  microscopy analysis had detectable microspheres on  153 
their gills. In Figure 1 gill tissue taken from a c rab exposed to (A) aminated (NH 2) polystyrene and (B) 154 
carboxylated (COOH) polystyrene is shown. 155 
Full strength salinity (33 ppt) 156 
Oxygen consumption   157 
The oxygen consumption of crabs at 1h, 16h and 24h post treatment with neutrally charged polystyrene i s 158 
shown in Figure 2A. After 1h post treatment crabs w ith the highest concentration of plastic (10 7 microspheres 159 
Lá1) had a significantly lower oxygen consumption (0.0 14 ± 0.002 mL O 2 gá1 há1) compared to the control 160 
(0.028 ± 0.004 mL O 2 gá1 há1) (F 2,29 =3.99, p=0.030). However, after 16h and 24h postátr eatment there was no 161 
significant difference between either treatments an d the control (F 2,29 =0.05, p=0.956), (F 2,29 =1.17, p=0.325). 162 
There was no significant difference in the oxygen c onsumption between treatment groups in the particle  study 163 
with carboxyl and amino coated polystyrene or sedim ent at any time point. 164 
Heamolymph constituents 165 
There was a slight but significant drop in the conc entration of Na + ions (Figure 2B) within the heamolymph 166 
with increasing neutral plastic dose (F 2,29 = 4.75, p = 0.017). Crabs held in control condition s had an average 167 
of 564 ± 6.70 mmol Lá1 Na +, while crabs exposed to 10 6 microspheres L á1 presented a heamolymph Na + 168 
concentrations of 546 ± 5.62 mmol Lá1 which was not significantly different from the con trols. Crabs, 169 
however, treated with 10 7 microspheres L á1 had significantly lower concentration of Na + (522 ± 14.31 mmol Lá170 
1) than control crabs (Tukey p<0.05). There was a si gnificant increase in the concentration of Ca 2+  ions (Figure 171 
2C) within the heamolymph with increasing plastic d ose (F 2,29 = 31.5, p < 0.001). Crabs held in control 172 
conditions had an average of 61.1 ± 0.75 mmol Lá1 Ca 2+ , crabs treated with 10 6 microspheres L á1 had 62.9 ± 173 
0.92 mmol Lá1 Ca 2+ , and crabs treated with 10 7 microspheres L á1 had 70.3 ± 0.93 mmol Lá1 Ca 2+ , significantly 174 
higher than the controls and lower plastic concentr ation (Tukey P<0.05). There was no significant diffe rence 175 
in the concentration of K + ion (F 2,29 = 1.05, p = 0.363).  176 Page 7 of 15
ACS Paragon Plus EnvironmentEnvironmental Science & TechnologyThere was no dose dependant effect seen with heamol ymph protein concentration. There was a slight but 177 
significantly higher concentration of haemocyanin w ithin the heamolymph with increasing plastic dose ( F2,29 = 178 
4.99, p = 0.014). Crabs held in control conditions had an average haemocyanin concentration of 0.48 ± 0.03 179 
mmol L á1, while crabs treated with 10 6 microspheres L á1 presented a significantly lower concentration (0.4 6 ± 180 
0.01 mmol L á1) (Tukey p<0.05). Haemocyanin concentration were si milar to controls at the highest 181 
concentration of plastic used (10 7 microspheres L á1), with a value of 0.59 ± 0.04 mmol L á1. Although protein 182 
concentration in the heamolymph followed the same p attern as haemocyanin, there was no significant 183 
differences found (F 2,29 = 2.72, p = 0.084) (see SI.1).  184 
There was no significant effect on haemocyanin (F 5,33 = 0.17, p = 0.974), heamolymph protein (F 5,33 = 0.72, p= 185 
0.611), Na + (F5,53= 1.98, p= 0.099), K+ (F 5,33 = 1.04, p= 0.405), or Ca 2+  (F 5,53= 0.42, p = 0.832) ions when 186 
exposed to sediment, carboxyl or amino coated plast ics. 187 
As there was a dose dependant effect between neutra l plastics and oxygen consumption and Na + and Ca 2+  ions, 188 
a reduced salinity experiment was performed to see whether these effects would exaggerate  or disappear 189 
during an osmotic challenge.  190 
Reduced Salinity 191 
Oxygen consumption 192 
The oxygen consumption of crabs at 1h, 6h and 24h p ost salinity challenge is shown in Figure 3A. There  193 
wereno significant differences between any treatmen ts or control after 1h (F 4,44 = 0.40, P = 0.808) or 6h (F 4,44 = 194 
2.05, p = 0.106). However, after 24h there was a si gnificant increase in oxygen consumption (F 4,44 = 5.25, p = 195 
0.002) with control crabs kept at 33ppt having a si gnificantly lower oxygen consumption than crabs at reduced 196 
salinity with 0, 10 5 and 10 6 microspheres per L á1 (Tukey p < 0.05). There were no significant change s in 197 
oxygen consumption, within any of the treatments ov er time (F 4,46 = 1.605, p = 0.192, repeated measures 198 
ANOVA), nor a significant effect of plastic concent ration. 199 
Heamolymph constituents 200 
There was a significant effect of salinity on all i ons (Na +( F 4,43 = 30.97, p<0.001) (Figure 3B) Ca 2+  (F 4,43 = 201 
56.11, p < 0.001) (Figure 3C) and K + (F4,43 = 50.17, p < 0.001)) and heamolymph osmolality (F 4,40 = 35.83, p < 202 
0.001) (osmolality and K+ seen in SI.2). Whilst all values were lower in the crabs challenged by low sa linity, 203 
there was no significant effect of plastic concentr ation (Tukey, p>0.05). There was no significant dif ference in 204 
the haemocyanin concentration (F 4,43 = 1.57, p = 0.201) or heamolymph protein concentrat ion (F 4,42 = 0.62, p = 205 
0.649) between salinity or plastic treatments were also found. 206 
Discussion 207 
In the current study we show that polystyrene micro spheres with different surface coatings are readily  taken 208 
up onto the gills of crabs following exposure throu gh water, but that the physiological consequences t o the 209 
crabs, under the short term exposure conditions of our experiments, were minimal.Transient, dose depen dent 210 Page 8 of 15
ACS Paragon Plus EnvironmentEnvironmental Science & Technologychanges in oxygen consumption and ion regulation we re found, which returned to normal levels within th e 211 
acute time frame of the exposures. This shows that the crabs are able to recover gas exchange for exam ple by 212 
recruiting more lamellae, increasing perfusion or w ater flow in the branchial chamber. Na + and Ca 2+  were both 213 
significantly altered by increasing concentrations of plastic with less Na + and more Ca 2+  within the crab 214 
lamellae at the highest concentrations of plastic. These are however minor differences; Na + dropped by 7.45 % 215 
and Ca 2+  rose by an average 15.1 % compared to the control.  To put this into context when Carcinus maenas  216 
was exposed to 10 mg L á1 of copper, Na + decreased from 347 ± 14 mmol Lá1 to 269 ± 54 mmol Lá1 a drop of 217 
22 %. 23  In this study a change of salinity from 33 ppt to 10 ppt in crabs not dosed with microplastic resulte d in 218 
a 39.8 % drop in Na + plasma concentration (from 508 ± 4.35 mmol L á1 to 306 ± 18.21 mmol L á1). Evidently, 219 
crabs are able to overcome these minor effects on i on exchange induced by exposure to the polystyrene 220 
microspheres used here by minor physiological regul ation. 221 
When exposed to a low salinity challenge, crabs als o showed an increase in oxygen consumption. 24  This is 222 
thought to be associated with the increased cost of  osmoregulation in the face of an osmoregulatory ch allenge 223 
(difference between internal and external mediums).  No effects of either microplastics or sediments we re 224 
found in the face of low salinity challenge, sugges ting that no additive effect or interaction occurs between the 225 
mechanisms by which plastics affects ion balance an d crab ion regulation.  226 
We were able to show using bioáimaging that polysty rene microspheres with different surface coatings 227 
carboxylated (COOH) and aminated (NH 2) were taken up into the gill chambers. We categori sed the potential 228 
charge of these plastics (Supplemental Information S I.3) showing that the small positive or negative ch arges 229 
would be masked in the external medium by the large  buffering capacity of sea water. Once inside the g ill 230 
chamber, we did not find any effect of these partic les on oxygen consumption and ion exchange although  231 
there were some qualitative variations in the patte rn of distribution across the surface of the gills (Figure 1). In 232 
vertebrates, the in vivo  behaviour of micro and nano polymers varies depend ing on numerous physicoá 233 
chemical properties of the particles, including siz e, surface charge, aspect ratio, porosity and surfa ce corona. 25  234 
The circulation time of particles within the body i s significantly enhanced for hydrophilic and positi vely 235 
charged particles 26 .  Positively charged particles generally show high er cytotoxicity across a range of model 236 
systems than negatively charged ones, This has been  attributed to the interaction of cations with the negatively 237 
charged cell membrane. 27  238 
Acrylic ester nanoá and microápolymers showed low t oxicity following inhalation in rats, which may hav e 239 
been due to their anionic surface charge.28  Studies in which the surface charge of stearylamineápolylactic acid 240 
(PLA) polymer particles were modified from positive  to negative confirmed that those with a positive c harge 241 
showed higher toxicity in the lung and were taken u p more readily into cells.29  The influence of surface 242 
characteristics of particles on the binding capacit y within the gills of aquatic animals would be an i ntriguing 243 
avenue for future study. 244 
In conclusion, we show here that acute inhalation o f polystyrene microsphere into the gill chambers of  crabs 245 
lead to a small but transient change in oxygen cons umption and ion regulation. Neither microspheres no r 246 Page 9 of 15
ACS Paragon Plus EnvironmentEnvironmental Science & Technologynatural sediments altered the crab’s response to os motic stress, regardless of plastic concentration a dded. 247 
Carboxylated (COOH) and aminated (NH 2) polystyrene microspheres were distributed differe ntly across the 248 
gill surface; likely due to their interaction with the gill surface, although neither had a significan t adverse 249 
impact on gill function. These results illustrate t he physiological resilience of shore crabs in maint aining 250 
osmoregulatory and respiratory function after acute  exposure to both anthropogenic plastics and natura l 251 
particles.  252
