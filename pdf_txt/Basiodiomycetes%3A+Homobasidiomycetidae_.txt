Abstract.— Homobasidiomycetes include the majority of wood-decaying fungi. Two basic forms of
wood decay are known in homobasidiomycetes: white rot, in which lignin and cellulose are de-
graded, and brown rot, in which lignin is not appreciably degraded. An apparent correlation has been
noted between production of a brown rot, decay of conifer substrates, and possession of a bipolar
mating system (which has a single mating-type locus, in contrast to tetrapolar systems, which have
two mating-type loci). The goals of this study were to infer the historical pattern of transformations
in decay mode, mating type, and substrate range characters, and to determine if a causal relationship
exists among them. Using nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA sequences, we performed a phylogenetic
analysis of 130 species of homobasidiomycetes and performed ancestral state reconstructions by us-
ing parsimony on a range of trees, with various loss:gain cost ratios. We evaluated pairwise character
correlations by using the concentrated changes test (CCT) of Maddison and the maximum likelihood
(ML) method of Pagel. White rot, tetrapolar mating systems, and the ability to decay conifers and
hardwoods appear to be plesiomorphic in homobasidiomycetes, whereas brown rot, bipolar mating
systems, and exclusive decay of conifers appear to have evolved repeatedly. The only signi/bullet5cant cor-
relation among characters was that between brown rot (as the independent character) and exclusive
decay of conifer substrates ( P<0:03). This correlation was supported by the CCT on a range of plau-
sible trees, although not with every reconstruction of ancestral states, and by the ML test. Our /bullet5ndings
suggest that the evolution of brown rot has promoted repeated shifts to specialization for conifer sub-
strates. [Ancestral state reconstruction; basidiomycetes; comparative methods; concentrated changes

The vast majority of terrestrial biomass
takes the form of wood and other plant tis-
sues. The monumental task of recycling the
carbon sequestered in wood falls primar-
ily to homobasidiomycetes, which include
/c18713,000 described species ofmushrooms and
related macrofungi. Other fungi, such as as-
comycetes and heterobasidiomycetes, and
certain bacteria are also involved in wood
decay but to a lesser extent. Two principal
modes of wood decay are recognized in the
homobasidiomycetes: white rot and brown
rot (Rayner and Boddy, 1988; Worrall et al.,
1997). White rot fungi degrade both lignin
and cellulose (the major components of plant
cell walls), leaving the substrate bleached
and with a stringy consistency (Blanchette,
1991). In contrast, brown rot fungi selec-
tively remove cellulose but do not appre-
ciably degrade lignin. After colonization by
brown rot fungi, the substrate has a reddish-
brown color and a soft, crumbly consistency.
Brown rot residues are highly resistant to
further decomposition and make up a major1Present address and address for correspondence:

perate and boreal forests (Gilbertson, 1980).
The origin and diversi/bullet5cation of wood
decay mechanisms in homobasidiomycetes
has had a large impact on terrestrial ecosys-
tems. In this study, we inferred phyloge-
netic relationships of homobasidiomycetes
and the historical pattern of transformations
between white rot and brown rot modes of
wood decay. Using phylogenetic compara-
tive methods, we evaluated previously pro-
posed ecological and genetic correlates of de-
cay modes. The general goal of this study
was to understand some of the causal factors
that have shaped the evolution of forested
ecosystems.
Taxonomic Distribution and Correlates
of Decay Modes
The mode of wood decay has been an im-
portant taxonomic character in homobasid-
iomycetes, especially in the predominantly
wood-decaying polypores and corticioid
fungi (crustlike, resupinate forms; Nobles,
1965, 1971; Stalpers, 1978; Gilbertson, 1980;
Redhead and Ginns, 1985; Nakasone, 1990).
Wood decay mode has generally been

regarded as a moderately conservative char-
acter and has often been used to differenti-
ate genera. For example, Redhead and Ginns
(1985) segregated the brown rot gilled mush-
room genus Neolentinus from Lentinus , which
is otherwise composed of white rot species.
Similarly, Gilbertson and Ryvarden (1986)
distinguished the brown rot polypore genus
Antrodia from the morphologically similar
white rot genus Antrodiella .
White rot is by far the more common
form of wood decay in the homobasid-
iomycetes. Gilbertson (1980) estimated that
1,568 species of wood-decaying homobasid-
iomycetes have been described from North
America, whereas only 103 species (7%) pro-
duce a brown rot (Table 1). According to
Gilbertson (1980), 71 species (70%) of the
North American brown rot fungi are in the
Polyporaceae s. lat., which has long been re-
garded as an arti/bullet5cial taxon (Donk, 1964).
According to the dominant morphology-
based taxonomies of homobasidiomycetes
(Donk, 1964; Singer, 1986), the remaining
brown rot homobasidiomycetes are clas-
si/bullet5ed in six additional families: Conio-
phoraceae, Corticiaceae, Paxillaceae, Sparas-
sidaceae, Stereaceae, and Tricholomataceae.
Except for the Sparassidaceae, which has
only two species in North America, each
family that contains brown rot species also
contains white rot species (Table 1). Recent
molecular studies (reviewed by Hibbett and
Thorn, 2001) suggest that /bullet5ve of the fami-
lies that contain brown rot species (Cortici-
aceae, Paxillaceae, Polyporaceae, Stereaceae,
and Tricholomataceae) are polyphyletic.
Because brown rot fungi are few in number
and occur in taxonomically disparate groups,
Gilbertson (1980) suggested that brown rot
has been repeatedly derived from white rot.

aGilbertson also listed two species of Coprinaceae as produc-
ing a brown rot, but this has been refuted (Redhead and Ginns,
1985).In contrast, Nobles (1965, 1971) suggested
that brown rot is the plesiomorphic form in
the homobasidiomycetes, and that white rot
has been repeatedly derived by elaboration
of wood decay mechanisms (i.e., gaining the
ability to degrade lignin). Most recent au-
thors have supported Gilbertson’s view that
the brown rot fungi are derived (Ryvarden,
1991; Worrall et al., 1997; but see Watling,
1982); however, these inferences have not
been based on phylogenetic analyses. In-
deed, the lack of a broad phylogenetic classi-
/bullet5cation of homobasidiomycetes has been the
primary obstacle to understanding the evo-
lution of decay modes (Rayner and Boddy,
1988). The arti/bullet5cial nature of the Polypo-
raceae is especially limiting, owing to the
concentration of brown rot taxa in this family
(Table 1).
Gilbertson (1980, 1981) and others have
noted an apparent correlation between pro-
duction of a brown rot and decay of conifer
substrates. On the basis of monographs and
/bullet6oristic treatments by Overholts (1953) and
Lowe (1966), Gilbertson (1980) estimated that
85% (60 species) of the brown rot–producing
polypores in North America occur on conifer
substrates. The relative frequencies of brown
rot and white rot fungi on speci/bullet5c conifer
and hardwood hosts also suggest that brown
rot fungi are preferentially associated with
conifers. Looking at seven species of conifers,
Gilbertson (1980) found that, on average,
206 species of homobasidiomycetes decayed
each host, of which 24% were brown rot
fungi. In contrast, in seven species of hard-
woods, an average of 114 species of homoba-
sidiomycetes decayed each host, of which
only 7% were brown rot fungi.
Another apparent correlation has been
noted between the production of a brown
rot and the presence of a bipolar mat-
ing system (an outcrossing mating sys-
tem, in which mating compatibility is gov-
erned by a single locus, in contrast to
tetrapolar systems, in which compatibility is
governed by two loci). Determination of mat-
ing compatibility in homobasidiomycetes re-
quires laboratory crossing studies with labor-
intensive microscopic observations of hyphal
septa. Nevertheless, mating type has been
used as a taxonomic character, especially in
wood-decaying fungi (e.g., Stalpers, 1978;
Nakasone, 1990). The data Esser (1967) com-
piled on mating systems in 335 species of
homobasidiomycetes suggested that /c18725% at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 2001 HIBBETT AND DONOGHUE—EVOLUTION OF WOOD DECAY MECHANISMS 217
of homobasidiomycetes are bipolar, 65% are
tetrapolar, and 10% are homothallic (sel/bullet5ng).
Gilbertson (1980:34) noted that “all of the
brown-rot fungi in the Polyporaceae tested
to date are bipolar,” and that “Only Dacry-
obolus sudans in the Corticiaceae and Veluti-
ceps berkeleyi Cooke ex Pat. in the Stereaceae
are known to be tetrapolar brown rotters.”
Ryvarden (1991) con/bullet5rmed the general pat-
tern of association between brown rot and
bipolar mating systems, although he also
listed two brown rot tetrapolar homobasid-
iomycetes in the Polyporaceae ( Amylocystis
lapponica andParmastomyces transmutans ). As
with wood decay modes, the evolutionary
polarity of transformations between mating
systems remains controversial. Some authors
have suggested that bipolar mating systems
are plesiomorphic (Nobles, 1971; Ryvarden,
1991), but others conclude they have been
repeatedly derived from tetrapolar systems
(Raper and Flexer, 1971; Hibbett and Thorn,
2001).
Gilbertson (1980) proposed a hypothe-
sis to explain the apparent correlation be-
tween brown rot, bipolarity, and decay of
conifer substrates. Considering that conifer-
dominated habitats, such as high-altitude or
boreal forests, have shorter growing seasons
than do hardwood-dominated habitats, he
reasoned there would be selection for accel-
erated life cycles in conifer-dominated habi-
tats. For reasons explained below, Gilbertson
suggested that fungi with brown rot decay
mechanisms and bipolar mating systems
would have accelerated life cycles relative
to fungi with white rot decay mechanisms
or tetrapolar mating systems. In the present
study, we used the concentrated changes test
(CCT) of Maddison (1990; Maddison and
Maddison, 1992) and the maximum likeli-
hood (ML) method of Pagel (1994, 1997) to
evaluate potential evolutionary correlations
among these characters. Because these meth-
ods require pairwise comparisons of discrete
characters, we have restated Gilbertson’s hy-
pothesis as a series of testable hypotheses in-
volving pairs of characters:
Brown rot versus decay of conifer substrates.—
Citing laboratory studies of wood decay,
Gilbertson suggested that brown rot fungi
decay wood more rapidly than white rot
fungi. Therefore, he reasoned that brown
rot fungi would have a /bullet5tness advantage
over white rot fungi in conifer-dominated
forests. An alternative explanation of whybrown rot fungi are preferentially associated
with conifers could be that some physical or
chemical property of conifer wood makes it
more accessible to brown rot fungi than to
white rot fungi. For example, Rayner and
Boddy (1988:27–28) suggested that “the rel-
atively more refractory nature of lignins of
conifers may partly explain the more fre-
quent occurrence of brown rot in wood of
these trees than white rot.” In either case,
an association would be expected between
evolution of brown rot and a shift onto
conifer substrates. Gilbertson and Rayner
and Boddy’s hypotheses make no speci/bullet5c
predictions about which character changed
/bullet5rst. If evolution of brown rot promoted a
shift onto conifer substrates, then we should
expect to see a preponderance of shifts onto
conifers nested within groups that have a
brown rot. However, if the condition of grow-
ing on conifers promoted evolution of brown
rot, then we should expect to /bullet5nd a prepon-
derance of shifts to brown rot nested within
clades that decay conifers.
Bipolar mating systems versus decay of conifer
substrates.— Gilbertson predicted a correla-
tion between bipolar mating systems and
decay of conifer substrates for essentially
the same reason that he predicted a cor-
relation between brown rot and decay of
conifers, namely, that bipolar mating sys-
tems result in an acceleration of the life
cycle, which would confer a /bullet5tness ad-
vantage in conifer-dominated environments.
The presumed reason for the acceleration
is that the rate of formation of dikaryons,
the effectively diploid, sexually reproducing
stage of the homobasidiomycete life cycle,
should be greater in bipolar than in tetrapolar
species (because the haploid monokaryons
of bipolar species can mate with half of their
sibs, whereas those of tetrapolar species can
mate with only one quarter of their sibs).
Once again, Gilbertson’s hypothesis makes
no prediction about the order of evolution
of the two characters; it simply predicts that
evolution of bipolarity should be nonran-
domly associated with shifts onto conifer
substrates.
Brown rot versus bipolar mating systems.—
Finally, Gilbertson’s hypothesis predicts a
correlation between the evolution of brown
rot modes of wood decay and the evolution
of bipolar mating systems. Gilbertson im-
plied that the derivation of brown rot and
bipolarity represent a general trend toward at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 218 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 50
genetic reduction (i.e., loss of genes). This
idea was echoed by Worrall et al. (1997:217):
“Thus, development of a brown-rot fungus
from a white-rot fungus would be charac-
terized, in large part, by simpli/bullet5cation: con-
version from a bifactorial [ Dtetrapolar] to
unifactorial [ Dbipolar] mating system and
loss of extracellular phenoloxidase and ex-
oglucanase.” However, Gilbertson’s hypoth-
esis does not imply any direct causal inter-
action between these characters; evolution
of brown rot and evolution of bipolarity are
supposedly correlated simply because they
both contribute to an accelerated life cycle,
which he suggested is favored in conifer-
dominated forests.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Taxa, Genes, and Molecular Techniques
We sampled 133 species of basidiomycetes
(Table 2). The ingroup includes a diverse
assemblage of 130 species of homobasid-
iomycetes representing 37 families of Hy-
menomycetes and Gasteromycetes in tra-
ditional, morphology-based classi/bullet5cations
(Donk, 1964; Dring, 1973; Singer, 1986).
Hibbett and Thorn (2001) proposed an in-
formal phylogenetic classi/bullet5cation, based on
molecular phylogenies, that divides the ho-
mobasidiomycetes into eight major clades:
polyporoid clade, euagarics clade, bolete
clade, thelephoroid clade, russuloid clade,
hymenochaetoid clade, cantharelloid clade,
and gomphoid–phalloid clade. All eight
clades are represented in our data set
(Table 3). However, from crude estimates
of the number of described species in each
clade (Hibbett and Thorn, 2001), a sampling
bias is evident (Table 3). The most overrepre-
sented group is the polyporoid clade, which
includes 36% of the sampled taxa but rep-
resents only /c18710% of described species of
homobasidiomycetes. The most underrepre-
sented group is the euagarics clade, which
includes 17% of the sampled taxa but repre-
sents about 65% of described species of ho-
mobasidiomycetes, most of which are gilled
mushrooms (Table 3; Hibbett and Thorn,
2001).
Three species of heterobasidiomycete
“jelly fungi” were included for rooting
purposes, including Tremella foliacea (Tremel-
lales), Dacrymyces chrysospermus (Dacrymyc-
etales), and Auricularia auricula-judae
(Auriculariales). This choice of outgroupsis supported by analyses at more inclusive
levels than the present study, which suggest
that the heterobasidiomycetes make up a
paraphyletic assemblage within which the
homobasidiomycetes are nested (Swann and
Taylor, 1993, 1995).
Sequence data were obtained from nuclear
and mitochondrial small-subunit ribosomal
RNA genes (nu-rDNA and mt-rDNA, re-
spectively). Forty nu-rDNA and 31 mt-rDNA
sequences were generated for the present
study. The remaining sequences have been
published previously (see Table 2 for ref-
erences). Four species in the data set lack
mt-rDNA sequences ( Laurilia sulcata, Ne-
olentinus lepideus, Sparassis spathulata , and
Tremella foliacea ) and seven species lack nu-
rDNA sequences ( Acanthophysium cerrusa-
tus, Gloeocystidiellum porosum, Phlebia tremel-
losa, Scytinostroma portentosum, Sistotrema
sernanderi, Tulasnella pruinosa, and T. violea ).
Most species have full-length nu-rDNA se-
quences, but 16 species have partial nu-
rDNA sequences of /c1870.6 kb, which align
to a region between positions 567 and 1187
in the nu-rDNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Table 2).
The primers and protocols used for poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) ampli/bullet5cation
and sequencing have been described previ-
ously (White et al., 1990; Bruns and Szaro,
1992; Hibbett and Donoghue, 1995; Hibbett,
1996). Brie/bullet6y, complete nu-rDNA genes
(/c1871.8 kb) and partial mt-rDNA genes (0.5 kb
to>1.0 kb) were ampli/bullet5ed and sequenced
directly by using dye-terminator cycle-
sequencing chemistry (Applied Biosystems).
Sequencing reactions were run on an ABI 377
automated DNA sequencer. Sequences were
edited and contiguous sequences were as-
sembled by using ABI Analysis software and
Sequencher version 3.0 (GeneCodes Corp.).
DNA sequences generated for this study
have been deposited in GenBank (accession
numbers AF334868-AF334940) .
Alignment and Phylogenetic Analyses
DNA sequences were aligned by eye in
the data editor of PAUP¤4.0 (Swofford,
1999). Hypervariable regions that were too
divergent to be aligned were excluded from
analyses (see Results and Discussion). A
NEXUS /bullet5le containing the aligned sequences
has been deposited in TreeBASE (acces-
sion number 5580). For phylogenetic analy-
ses, we used equally weighted parsimony at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 2001 HIBBETT AND DONOGHUE—EVOLUTION OF WOOD DECAY MECHANISMS 219

ers. Phylogenetic trees were inferred by using
a two-step search protocol based on strate-
gies described by Olmstead et al. (1993) and
Maddison et al. (1992). In the /bullet5rst step of the
analyses, 100 or more heuristic searches were
performed, with random taxon addition se-
quences, MAXTREES set to autoincrease,
TBR branch swapping, and retention of no
more than two shortest trees per replicate. In
the second step of the analyses, the shortest
trees from the /bullet5rst step were used as starting
trees for TBR branch swapping with MAX-
TREES set to 3,000. This general search pro-
tocol was followed in all parsimony analyses

the number of replicate heuristic searches
in the /bullet5rst step of the analysis. Topologi-
cal robustness was estimated by bootstrap
analysis (Felsenstein, 1985; Sanderson, 1995).
Bootstrap analyses used 100 replicate heuris-
tic searches, each with one random taxon
addition sequence, TBR branch swapping,
and retention of one tree per replicate.
Before combining the nu-rDNA and mt-
rDNA data, we performed a series of analy-
ses to assess the combinability of the data, us-
ing a 123-taxon core dataset that excluded all
taxa that lacked either nu-rDNA or mt-rDNA
data. Global and local tests of combinability at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 222 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 50
were performed. To assess the global test of
combinability we used the ILD test of Far-
ris et al. (1994, 1995), implemented as the
partition homogeneity test in PAUP¤, with
100 replicates and all nucleotide positions
included.
Local tests of incongruence were con-
ducted to evaluate positive con/bullet6ict involv-
ing individual nodes in trees derived from
the independent data partitions. The /bullet5rst
step in this process was to perform inde-
pendent analyses of the mt-rDNA and nu-
rDNA data partitions in the core dataset.
The basic two-step search protocol outlined
above was used, with 100 replicate searches
in step one of the analysis. Bootstrap analy-
ses were performed as described above. We
evaluated con/bullet6icting nodes in the mt-rDNA
and nu-rDNA trees, that is, nodes that were
supported by 70% or more of the bootstrap
replicates from one data partition but were
positively incongruent with the strict con-
sensus tree derived from the other data par-
tition (regardless of its bootstrap support).
For each potentially con/bullet6icting node, a con-
straint tree was constructed in MacClade ver-
sion 3.0 (Maddison and Maddison, 1992) that
forced monophyly of that node but speci/bullet5ed
no other topological structure. Constrained
phylogenetic analyses were performed using
only the /bullet5rst step of the general search pro-
tocol (i.e., 100 replicate searches with TBR,
keeping only two trees per replicate), and the
results were compared with unconstrained
trees by using the Wilcoxon signed ranks
test (WSR; Templeton, 1983) implemented in
PAUP¤.
After testing for incongruence, the data
partitions were combined and subjected to
parsimony analyses. Combined analyses of
the core data set (with no missing data) used
100 replicate searches in step one of the anal-
ysis, whereas combined analyses of the full
data set (including those taxa missing either
nu-rDNA or mt-rDNA data) used 5,000 repli-
cate searches in step one of the analysis. In the
analysis ofthefull dataset, individual islands
of trees (Maddison, 1991) were delimited by
swapping on the trees obtained in the /bullet5rst
step of the analysis one at a time and using
the “get trees” options to /bullet5lter the remaining
trees. Strict consensus trees were generated
from all equally most-parsimonious trees, as
well as from each set of trees representing
one tree island (in analysis of the full data
set only). Bootstrap analyses were performedas described above. Transition/transversion
ratios for the nu-rDNA and mt-rDNA data
partitions were inferred with parsimony by
using MacClade.
Constrained analyses of the full data set
were performed to evaluate two alternative
phylogenetic hypotheses that are suggested
by morphology, as well as by decay mode
and mating system characters. Constrained
analyses used 1,000 replicate searches in step
one of the analysis. Results of constrained
and unconstrained analyses were compared
by the WSR test. In each constrained analy-
sis, only one node was constrained at a time.
Constraint one forced Gloeophyllum sepiar-
ium, Heliocybe sulcata , and Neolentinus lepi-
deus to form a monophyletic group (hereafter
referred to as the “ Gloeophyllum clade”) and a
group of 14 other species, mostly polypores,
that we call the “ Antrodia clade” (see Results
and Discussion). Gloeophyllum, Neolentinus ,
and Heliocybe share several characters with
(most) members of the Antrodia clade, includ-
ing production of a brown rot and bipolar
mating system.
Constraint two forced monophyly of the
members of the polyporoid clade, Gloeo-
phyllum clade, euagarics clade, bolete clade,
thelephoroid clade, and russuloid clade. This
constraint re/bullet6ects a hypothesis of higher-
level phylogenetic relationships of homoba-
sidiomycetes, based on an analysis of four
rDNA regions (nuclear and mitochondrial
large and small subunit rDNA) in a subset
of the taxa used in this study (Hibbett, un-
published). This constraint is also congru-
ent with comparative data on the ultrastruc-
ture of septal pores. As far as we know, all
members that have been investigated of the
groups united by this constraint have perfo-
rated parenthesomes (membrane-bound or-
ganelles that /bullet6ank septal pores). In contrast,
all members of the hymenochaetoid, can-
tharelloid, and gomphoid–phalloid clades
that have been investigated, as well as many
heterobasidiomycetes, have nonperforated
parenthesomes—which appears to be the
plesiomorphic condition of the homobasid-
iomycetes (Hibbett and Thorn, 2001).
Character Coding and Ancestral State
Reconstruction
Ancestral states in decay mode, mat-
ing system, and substrate range charac-
ters were estimated with parsimony by at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 2001 HIBBETT AND DONOGHUE—EVOLUTION OF WOOD DECAY MECHANISMS 223
using MacClade (Maddison and Maddison,
1992). Characters were scored from litera-
ture sources (listed in the Appendix). In a
few cases, we had to score species on the
basis of reports regarding putatively closely
related species. Thus, the mating type of
Stropharia rugosoannulata was based on re-
ports about S. merdaria, S. semiglobata , and S.
umbonatescens ; the mating type of Dacrymyces
chrysopsermus was based on Cerinomyces spp .;
the mating type of Dentocorticium sulphurel-
lumwas based on D. ussuricum ; and all char-
acters of Vararia insolita were based on V.
sphericospora and other Vararia species .
All characters were scored in binary form.
“Decay mode” (0 Dwhite rot, 1 Dbrown rot)
was scored as missing ( Duncertain) for 23
species, including 12 of 15 ectomycorrhizal
species in the data set. However, the ectomy-
corrhizal species Amanita muscaria , which has
been shown to degrade lignin (Trojanowski
et al., 1984), was scored as having white rot.
“Mating type” (0 Dtetrapolar, 1 Dbipolar)
was scored as missing in 73 species, includ-
ing four species that have been reported to
be homothallic or simply heterothallic.
Two alternative characters were scored to
represent substrate range. The /bullet5rst charac-
ter, “conifer decay ability,” was based on
whether a species has ever been reported
growing on conifer wood substrates (0 Dnot
reported on conifer wood; 1 Dreported on
conifer wood). Ectomycorrhizal species were
scored as 0. Two species for which data are
insuf/bullet5cient were scored as missing: Scytinos-
troma aluta and Multiclavula mucida . The al-
ternativecharacter, “conifer exclusivity,”was
based on whether a species occurs exclu-
sively as a saprotroph on conifer wood (0 D
not exclusively on conifers, 1 Dexclusively
on conifers). No taxa were scored as missing.
The two codings of substrate range differed
in their treatment of taxa that occur on both
conifers and hardwoods. Such taxa are coded
1 under conifer decay ability, whereas under
conifer exclusivity they are coded 0.
Ancestral state reconstructions were per-
formed for each character on trees derived
from the unconstrained analysis of the full
data set, as well as those derived from both of
the constrained analyses. Each optimization
was performed for a range of /bullet5ve loss:gain
cost ratios (3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3), which were
implemented by using step matrices. The
goal of these exercises was to explore the sen-
sitivity of ancestral state reconstructions toalternative tree topologies (Donoghue and
Ackerly, 1996) and assumptions regarding
the cost of gains versus losses (Ree and
Donoghue, 1999).
Correlation Analyses
We investigated potential correlations
among three sets of organismal attributes:
decay mode, mating system, and substrate
range. Because there were two alternative
codings of substrate range (conifer decay
ability vs. conifer exclusivity), /bullet5ve pairwise
interactions among characters had to be con-
sidered. In each case, there was no a priori
hypothesis about which character in the pair
should be considered dependent and which
independent. Thus, 10 classes of compara-
tive analyses could have been performed.
To identify the pairs of characters that were
most likely to be correlated, we inspected an-
cestral state reconstructions on tree 1 from
the /bullet5rst island of trees discovered in the un-
constrained analysis of the full data set, as-
suming equally weighted losses and gains.
When the pattern of changes exhibited by
a pair of characters suggested a causal rela-
tionship might exist between them, we tested
the correlation by using the CCT, based on
the most-parsimonious resolutions (MPRs)
obtained with equally weighted losses and
gains (Donoghue, 1989; Maddison, 1990;
Maddison and Maddison, 1992; see below
for details). Correlations found to be signif-
icant with the CCT were also evaluated by
using the ML test in Discrete (Pagel, 1994;
see below).
The CCT was performed with 1,000 sim-
ulations, MINSTATE character state recon-
struction, and “compensation” set to 1. Sig-
ni/bullet5cance was assessed by determining the
probability of observing as many as, or more
than, the inferred number of gains (and any
number of losses) in the dependent charac-
ter nested within the “distinguished” clades
(Maddison and Maddison, 1992). Initial P
values were multiplied by the number of
tests to correct for multiple tests.
Often, we found more than one MPR
for at least one of the characters in a pair.
In addition, some reconstructions suggested
changes in both the dependent and indepen-
dent character along the same branch. In such
cases, we performed the CCT by using two
different MPRs, choosing those that maxi-
mized gains or losses, and used different at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 224 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 50
assumptions regarding the sequence of evo-
lution in characters that were inferred to
change on the same branch. The goal of
these exercises was to test potential correla-
tions among characters by using those pat-
terns of character evolution that were most
likely or least likely to support a correlation
(Maddison and Maddison, 1992). We also ex-
amined the sensitivity of our results to alter-
native tree topologies; when signi/bullet5cant re-
sults were obtained for tree 1 from island 1,
we repeated the test, using one tree from each
of the six other independent islands of most-
parsimonious trees from the unconstrained
analysis, as well as one tree from each of the
two constrained analyses.
We used the ML method of Pagel (1994,
1997), implemented in Discrete (running un-
der Windows NT), to evaluate the hypoth-
esis that possession of brown rot promotes
shifts onto conifer substrates (which was sug-
gested by the CCT; see Results and Discus-
sion). Discrete requires that all terminal taxa
be scored for the characters of interest. There-
fore, we coded the 23 species with missing
values for wood decay according to the states
inferred by using equally weighted parsi-
mony optimization. The test was performed
with tree 1 from the unconstrained analysis
and with branch lengths set equal tothe num-
bers of nucleotide substitutions inferred by
parsimony. However, because Discrete does
not tolerate zero-length branches, two zero-
length terminal branches (leading to Wol/bullet5po-
ria cocos and Laurilia sulcata ) were set to one
step. Finally, the branch connecting the out-
group Dacrymyces to the rest of the taxa was
arbitrarily rooted at its midpoint.
Discrete infers amodel of evolution for two
characters. The model parameters that Dis-
crete estimates are the instantaneous trans-
formation probabilities for each character,
given a particular state in the other charac-
ter; two characters would have eight sepa-
rate parameters (Pagel, 1994). We estimated
two models of evolution. In the /bullet5rst model,
the probability of a gain in conifer exclusiv-
ity is independent of the state of wood de-
cay. Accordingly, the parameter that de/bullet5nes
the probability of a gain of conifer exclusiv-
ity when decay mode Dwhite rot was re-
stricted to being equal to the parameter that
de/bullet5nes the probability of a gain of conifer
exclusivity when decay mode Dbrown rot.
Thus, there are seven free parameters in the
/bullet5rst model. In the second model, the param-eters are not restricted to being equal, which
allows the probability of transformations to
conifer exclusivity to vary according to the
state of wood decay. The second model has
eight free parameters. A branch-scaling pa-
rameter was also estimated for both classes
of models. Thus, the two models are nested
and have eight and nine free parameters, re-
spectively (Pagel, 1994). The analysis for each
model was repeated 10 times (with up to 25 it-
erations of the maximization steps in each
analysis), and the optimal likelihood scores,
L(D8) and L(D9), for each model were com-
pared. The likelihood ratio statistic is twice
the difference in ¡log Land is Â2distributed
with one degree of freedom (Pagel, 1994).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Sequence and Alignment Characteristics
In most isolates, PCR products of nu-
rDNA were /c1871.8 kb. However, as described
previously (Hibbett, 1996), /bullet5ve species
(Lentinellus omphalodes, L. ursinus, Clavicorona
pyxidata, Panellus stypticus , and Laetiporus
portentosus ) have group 1 introns of /c187400 bp,
which are inserted at the same position in all
species and were excised before alignment.
In most taxa, the nu-rDNA sequences could
be aligned with little ambiguity across their
entire length. However, the nu-rDNA of Can-
tharellus tubaeformis contained three hyper-
variable regions of 54, 114, and 91 bp that
could not be aligned to the other taxa in the
study. After excluding the hypervariable re-
gions of Cantharellus and trimming /c18745 bp
from the start and end of the alignment, the
usable nu-rDNA sequences were 1,820 bp,
including 737 (40%) variable positions and
434 (24%) parsimony-informative positions.
The transition/transversion ratio in the nu-
rDNA data partition (inferred with parsi-
mony, based on tree 1 produced in the com-
bined analysis of the full data set) was 1.895.
PCR products of mt-rDNA ranged from
/c187500 bp to >1 kb. This length variation re-
/bullet6ects insertions and deletions in three hyper-
variable regions that are interspersed among
four relatively conserved regions. This pat-
tern of variable and conserved regions in mi-
tochondrial small subunit rDNA has been
described previously in fungi and other or-
ganisms (Gray et al., 1984; Bruns and Szaro,
1992; Hibbett and Donoghue, 1995). Se-
quences from the hypervariable regions were
too divergent to be aligned except among at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 2001 HIBBETT AND DONOGHUE—EVOLUTION OF WOOD DECAY MECHANISMS 225
the most closely related taxa. Sequences of
the conserved regions were aligned sepa-
rately in four blocks, as described previ-
ously (Hibbett and Donoghue, 1995). The to-
tal aligned length of the conserved regions of
mt-rDNA was 509 bp. Within the conserved
regions, three regions of 6, 11, and 40 bp
were deemed ambiguously aligned and were
excluded from the analysis. After we ex-
cluded these regions and trimmed /c18740 bp
from the start of the alignment, the usable
mt-rDNA sequences were 418 bp, includ-
ing 339 (81%) variable positions, of which
267 (64%) were parsimony-informative. The
inferred transition/transversion ratio in the
mt-rDNA data partition was 0.881.
Independent Analyses and Tests
of Combinability
Independent analyses of nu-rDNA or mt-
rDNA each recovered large numbers of trees.
The /bullet5rst step of the independent analysis of
the nu-rDNA partition found two trees of
3,048 steps, which were hit once in 100 repli-
cates. TBR swapping on these trees with
MAXTREES set to 3,000 produced 3,000 trees
of 3,047 steps (consistency index [CI] D0.343,
retention index [RI] D0.534). The /bullet5rst step of
the analysis of the mt-rDNA partition found
four trees of 2,890 steps in two replicates. TBR
swapping on these trees with MAXTREES
set to 3,000 produced 3,000 trees of 2,888
steps (CI D0.229, RI D0.548). Results of the
ILD test suggested that the nuclear and mi-
tochondrial data partitions are signi/bullet5cantly
heterogeneous. The sum of the tree lengths
from analyses of the original partitions (6,032
steps) was 69 steps shorter than the smallest
sum of tree lengths from random partitions
(6,101–6,198 steps; PD0:01).
Because the ILD test suggested that the
data partitions were heterogeneous, we per-
formed constrained analyses with the WSR
test in an effort to identify incongruent place-
ments of taxa or clades, which might re-
/bullet6ect different phylogenetic histories among
the nuclear and mitochondrial rDNAs (de
Queiroz et al., 1995). Eight nodes in the nu-
rDNA tree that were supported by 70% or
more of the bootstrap replicates positively
con/bullet6ict with the strict consensus of the mt-
rDNA trees. Eight constrained analyses of
the mt-rDNA partition were performed, each
forcing the mt-rDNA tree to resolve one of
the strongly supported con/bullet6icting nodes re-solved by the analysis of nu-rDNA partition.
Constrained analyses produced from one to
eight trees each, ranging from 2,890 to 2,896
steps (2 to 8 steps longer than the uncon-
strained trees). None of the constrained trees
was rejected by the WSR test ( PD0.467–
0.925). Results of using the reciprocal analy-
ses for the nu-rDNA data partition were sim-
ilar. Eight nodes in the mt-rDNA tree that
were supported by 70% or more of the boot-
strap replicates positively con/bullet6ict with the
strict consensus of the nu-rDNA tree. Con-
strained analyses of the nu-rDNA data parti-
tion generated two to four trees each, which
ranged from 3,049 to 3,055 steps (2 to 8 steps
longer than the unconstrained trees), none
of which was rejected by the WSR test ( PD
0.382–0.981). Thus, even though the ILD test
suggested that the mitochondrial and nu-
clear data partitions are signi/bullet5cantly hetero-
geneous, using the WSR test we were un-
able to detect individual strongly con/bullet6icting
nodes, which might re/bullet6ect hybridization, lin-
eage sorting, or horizontal transmission, and
therefore we could not identify taxa or se-
quences that could have been pruned from
the dataset to eliminate con/bullet6ict (de Queiroz
et al., 1995).
The signi/bullet5cant result of the ILD test does
not necessarily indicate that the nu-rDNA
and mt-rDNA data partitions have differ-
ent underlying phylogenies. Studies by Sul-
livan (1996) and Cunningham (1997) with
empirical data from “known” phylogenies
suggest that strong process heterogeneity
(different rates of evolution) among datasets
with identical histories (e.g., /bullet5rst and sec-
ond vs. third codon positions, or linked mi-
tochondrial genes) can cause the ILD test to
indicate that the data sets are signi/bullet5cantly
heterogeneous. In the present study, the
greater frequency of variable positions in mt-
rDNA (81%) than nu-rDNA (40%), and the
much lower inferred transition/transversion
ratio in mt-rDNA (0.881) than in nu-rDNA
(1.895), suggest that the mt-rDNA evolves
faster than the nu-rDNA. Because we could
not detect strong incongruence among in-
dividual nodes in the nu-rDNA and mt-
rDNA trees with the WSR test, we infer that
the results of the ILD test re/bullet6ect evolution-
ary rate heterogeneity between the nu-rDNA
and mt-rDNA.
On the basis of simulation studies, Bull
et al. (1993) suggested that combining data
sets with strong process heterogeneity can at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 226 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 50
reduce phylogenetic accuracy. However, us-
ing empirical data sets, Sullivan (1996) and
Cunningham (1997) found that phylogenetic
accuracy may be improved in combined
analyses of data sets with strong process het-
erogeneity, even when the ILD test suggests
that the data sets should not be combined.
Sullivan (1996) suggested that the simulated
sequence data in the study of Bull et al. (1993)
may not realistically re/bullet6ect the distribution
of rate variation within and between real
genes. Given the /bullet5ndings of Sullivan (1996)
and Cunningham (1997), we do not think
our ILD test results warrant keeping the mt-
rDNA and nu-rDNA data separate.
Combined Analyses
Combined analyses of the core dataset. —Step
one of the combined analysis of the core
data set found two trees of 6,161 steps. TBR
swapping on these trees produced 220 trees
of 6,154 steps (CI D0.277, RI D0.517). The
combined analysis recovered fewer equally
most-parsimonious trees than either inde-
pendent analysis and provided more phylo-
genetic resolution. One hundred seven nodes
were resolved in the strict consensus of the
combined analysis, whereas 85 nodes were
resolved in the strict consensus of the inde-
pendent analysis of the nu-rDNA partition
and 91 nodes were resolved in strict con-
sensus of the independent analysis of the
mt-rDNA partition. In addition, the com-
bined analysis recovered more strongly sup-
ported nodes, as measured by bootstrapping,
than either independent analysis. In the com-
bined analysis, the 50% majority rule boot-
strap consensus tree had 54 nodes resolved,
with 34 nodes supported by at least 75%.
In contrast, in the nu-rDNA–only analysis,
the 50% majority rule consensus tree had
31 nodes resolved, with 19 receiving 75% or
better bootstrap support; in the mt-rDNA–
only analysis, the 50% majority rule consen-
sus tree had 36 nodes resolved, with 18 nodes
receiving 75% or better support. These re-
sults suggest that the combined data set has
a stronger phylogenetic signal than either
independent data set. Similar results were
obtained by Soltis et al. (1998), who found
that combined analyses of linked chloroplast
genes produced trees with greater resolution
and support (and had faster run times) than
independent analyses, even though the ILDtest suggested that the genes represented het-
erogeneous data partitions.
Combined analyses of the full data set. —Step
one of the combined analysis of the full data
set found 18 trees of 6,421 steps. TBR branch
swapping on these trees produced 1,720 trees
of 6,421 steps (CI D0.273, RI D0.526), which
occur in seven TBR islands. The two largest
islands (with 440and 880 trees)were hit twice
in the /bullet5rst step of the analysis, but the other
islands (with 40 to 160 trees each) were hit
only once.
The strict consensus of all equally most-
parsimonious trees has a 17-way poly-
chotomy near the base of the homobasid-
iomycetes (Fig. 1). Inspection of the strict
consensus trees from each of the tree is-
lands showed that the reason for this poly-
chotomy is that Dendrocorticum roseocarneum,
Gloeocystidiellum porosum , and the Gloeophyl-
lumclade occur in widely separated parts of
the tree in different islands (described be-
low; Fig. 2). These taxa were pruned from
the trees and the strict consensus was recalcu-
lated in PAUP¤(no redundant trees were cre-
ated by pruning; the pruned consensus tree is
not shown). In the consensus of the pruned
trees, the eight major clades of homobasid-
iomycetes described by Hibbett and Thorn
(2001) were resolved. These eight clades are

In islands 1–4 and 6 (totaling 1,600 trees),
G. porosum is in the russuloid clade (nested
with Laxitextum bicolor and Dentipellis sepa-
rans), but in islands 5 and 7 (totaling 120
trees), this species is in the polyporoid clade
(Figs. 1, 2). Consequently, the polyporoid
and russuloid clades partially collapse in the
strict consensus of all equally parsimonious
trees. When G. porosum was excluded from
the analysis, bootstrap support for the rus-
suloid clade increased to 76% and support
for the polyporoid clade rose to 36% (lev-
els of support for the other major clades
were not substantially changed; Fig. 1). Sev-
eral anatomical characters suggest that G.

resupinate fruiting body, and a smooth hy-
menophore (in G. porosum andL. bicolor only;
D. separans has a toothed hymenophore). In
constrast, no distinctive morphological char-
acters support placement of G. porosum in
the polyporod clade. The russuloid clade
was supported as monophyletic by the nu-
rDNA data alone but not by the mt-rDNA
data alone. Gloeocystidiellum porosum lacks
nu-rDNA. We speculate that the destabiliz-
ing effect of including G. porosum would be
mitigated by including nu-rDNA data for
this taxon.
In islands 2–7 (1,560 trees), Dendrocorti-
cium is the sister group of the Gloeophyllumclade, and the combined Dendrocorticium–
Gloeophyllum clade is the sister group of the
thelephoroid, bolete, euagarics, and poly-
poroid clades (Fig. 1). However, in island
1 (160 trees), Dendrocorticium is the sis-
ter group of the cantharelloid clade, and
theGloeophyllum clade is the sister group
of the thelephoroid, bolete, euagarics, and
polyporoid, hymenochaetoid, and russuloid
clades (Fig. 1). As a result, the higher-order
relationships among the eight major clades
are poorly resolved in the strict consen-
sus of all trees (Fig. 1). Unlike G. poro-
sum, the ambiguous placements of D. roseo-
carneum and the Gloeophyllum clade cannot
be attributed to missing data. All of these
species have both nu-rDNA and mt-rDNA
sequences, except Neolentinus lepideus , which
has only nu-rDNA data. Nevertheless, Neo-
lentinus is strongly supported as a member
of the Gloeophyllum clade (as the sister group at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 2001 HIBBETT AND DONOGHUE—EVOLUTION OF WOOD DECAY MECHANISMS 229
ofHeliocybe sulcata ), which is consistent with
expectations based on morphology (Pegler,
1983; Redhead and Ginns, 1985), as well as
independent analyses of nu-lsu rDNA se-
quences (Hibbett and Vilgalys, 1993; Thorn
et al., 2000).
We had no a priori expectations regarding
the placement of Dendrocorticium. However,
from its morphology, we expected the Gloeo-
phyllum clade to be nested in the polyporoid
clade, probably closely related to the Antro-
dia clade. This placement was forced under
constraint one. Analyses of the full data set
under constraint one produced 40 trees of
6,431 steps (10 steps longer than the optimal
trees), which we compared with 70 trees that
represent the seven islands of unconstrained
trees (10 trees from each island). None of the
constrained trees could be rejected based on
the WSR test ( PD0.302–0.355).
Analyses run under constraint two, which
forced monophyly of homobasidiomycetes
with perforate parenthesomes, produced 200
trees of 6,423 steps (2 steps longer than the
optimal trees), which we tested against the
same set of 70 unconstrained trees. None
was rejected by the WSR test ( PD0.854–
0.946). In summary, taking morphology into
account, we interpret the trees from islands
1–4 and 6 (which show G. porosum in the rus-
suloid clade) as the best estimates of the phy-
logeny. Nevertheless, based solely on molec-
ular characters, trees from the other islands
are equally parsimonious, and trees pro-

Character Coding and Ancestral State
Reconstructions
Parsimony-based inferences about histor-
ical patterns of character state transforma-
tions are dependent on the topology of the
phylogenetic tree (Donoghue and Ackerly,
1996) and the loss:gain cost ratio that is as-
sumed (Ree and Donoghue, 1998; Swofford
and Maddison, 1992). To assess the sensi-
tivity of our results to these factors, we
used a range of phylogenetic tree topologies
and loss:gain cost ratios to perform ancestral
state reconstructions (Table 4). The trees in-
cluded all 1,720 equally parsimonious trees
from the unconstrained combined analysis
of the full data set, as well as 240 suboptimal
trees from the two constrained analyses. The
strict consensus of the most-parsimonious
trees is largely unresolved, re/bullet6ecting the con-
/bullet6icting placements of several taxa (Figs. 1,
2). Nevertheless, most characters had only
minor variation across trees in the overall
number of losses versus gains inferred at a
given loss:gain cost ratio (Table 4). For ex-
ample, the number of losses and gains in
decay mode inferred under a 1:1 loss:gain
cost ratio ranged from 1–2 losses and 5–7
gains across all 1,960 trees examined. In con-
trast, ancestral state reconstructions were of-
ten quite sensitive to variation in loss:gain
cost ratios. For example, looking at tree 1 at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 230 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 50
from the unconstrained analysis, 1 MPR of
wood decay was inferred when using a 3:1
loss:gain cost ratio, indicating 1 loss and
7 gains, but 81 MPRs were inferred when
using a 1:3 loss:gain cost ratio, indicating
2–17 losses and 1–6 gains (Table 4). Thus,
in this study, inferences about general pat-
terns of character evolution are more sensi-
tive to assumptions about loss:gain bias than
to choice among plausible alternative tree
topologies. The sensitivity of the ancestral
state reconstructions to alternative trees and
loss:gain cost ratios (Table 4) provides a mea-
sure of their robustness.
Decay mode.— Eighty-nine species (67%)
were scored as white rot, and 21 species
(16%) were scored as brown rot. All of
the taxa that had been scored as missing
were optimized by equally weighted par-
simony on unconstrained trees as having
white rot (total scored plus inferred: 112
species [84%]). Gilbertson (1980) estimated
that 7% of North American wood-decaying
fungi produce a brown rot. Considering only
the saprotrophic or pathogenic species in our
data set, 18.3% produce a brown rot, which
suggests this character state is overrepre-
sented in our data set.
Ancestral state reconstructions on the un-
constrained trees under a 1:1 loss:gain cost
ratio have two MPRs, which suggests there
have been one to two transformations from
brown rot to white rot, and six to seven
transformations from white rot to brown
rot (Fig. 3; Table 4). The reason for the al-
ternative reconstructions is that Dacrymyces
chrysospermus , a brown rot species, is one of
the basal taxa in the outgroup, and there-
fore the root node can be resolved as ei-
ther brown rot or white rot (Fig. 3). Never-
theless, both MPRs suggest that the ances-
tor of the homobasidiomycetes was a white
rot fungus, as was suggested by Gilbertson
(1980; contra Nobles, 1965, 1971) (Fig. 4),
and that six independent origins of brown
rot, have occurred in the lineages leading
toWol/bullet5poria cocos, Fistulina hepatica, Ossi-
caulis lignatilis, Paxillus panuoides , the Gloeo-
phyllum clade ( Gloeophyllum, Heliocybe , and
Neolentinus ), and a weakly supported (boot-
strap <50%) group of 14 species that we
call the “ Antrodia clade” (Figs. 2, 3). This
may be an underestimate of the number of
gains of brown rot, however, because certain
brown rot taxa that we did not sample might
represent additional independent origins ofbrown rot (e.g., the agaric mushroom Hyp-
sizygus , the corticioid Veluticeps , and others)
(Gilbertson, 1980).
All MPRs on unconstrained trees under
a 1:1 loss:gain cost ratio suggest a reversal
from brown rot to white rot in the lineage
leading to Grifola frondosa , which is nested
among 13 brown rot species in the Antrodia
clade (Fig. 2). To assess the robustness of the
hypothesized reversal, we performed addi-
tional ancestral state reconstructions on the
unconstrained trees, increasing the cost of
losses. At a 4:1 loss:gain cost ratio, it becomes
equivocal whether the white rot condition of
Grifola is plesiomorphic or secondarily de-
rived. We also performed an additional con-
strained analysis of the full data set (using
100 replicate searches in step one of the anal-
ysis) that forced Grifola to be the sister group
of the rest of the Antrodia clade. Thirty trees
were obtained that are only two steps longer
than the unconstrained trees and could not be
rejected by the WSR test ( PD0.904). Again,
whether white rot in Grifola is plesiomorphic
or derived is equivocal.
Under most loss:gain cost ratios examined,
trees produced under constraint 1 (which
forces monophyly of the Gloeophyllum clade
plus the Antrodia clade) require one fewer
gain of brown rot than the unconstrained
trees or the trees produced under constraint
2. Otherwise, the number of losses and gains
of brown rot is fairly robust to the choice of
tree topology and loss:gain cost ratio.
Our results provide a phylogenetic frame-
work for comparative biochemical studies of
wood decay mechanisms. The challenge aris-
ing from our results is to test the hypothe-
sis that brown rot evolved repeatedly and to
elucidate the genetic basis of transformations
between white and brown rot. To do so, we
must compare the decay mechanisms of the
putatively convergent brown rot clades.
The most obvious chemical difference be-
tween brown rot and white rot modes of
wood decay is that brown rot fungi do not
appreciably degrade lignin, whereas white
rot fungi degrade lignin extensively. The
lignin-modifying enzymes characterized in
white rot fungi include laccases, lignin perox-
idases (LIP), and manganese-dependent per-
oxidases (MNP). Gilbertson (1980) and oth-
ers have suggested that brown rot fungi lack
these enzymes. Nevertheless, a few brown
rot fungi do have laccase, LIP, or MNP ac-
tivity (Szklarz et al., 1989; Dey et al., 1991; at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 2001 HIBBETT AND DONOGHUE—EVOLUTION OF WOOD DECAY MECHANISMS 231

D’Souza et al., 1996; Worrall et al., 1997),
and laccase-speci/bullet5c gene sequences in the
brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum have
been detected by PCR (D’Souza et al., 1996).
Unfortunately, few studies have focused on
the lignin-modifying enzymes of brown rot
fungi and so whether the general features of
brown rot fungi include the capacity to de-
grade lignin (and if so, by which enzymes) is
not known.
Another important difference between
brown rot and white rot decay mecha-
nisms is the mode of cellulose depolymer-
ization. Almost all white rot fungi that
have been tested can degrade pure cellu-
lose in culture, whereas most brown rot
fungi lack this ability (Nilsson, 1974). In
addition, white rot fungi degrade cellulose
by a purely enzymatic mechanism, whereas
brown rot fungi initiate cellulose depolymer-
ization by a nonenzymatic oxidative mecha-
nism (Worrall et al., 1997). However, the few
brown rot fungi that can degrade pure cel-
lulose in culture apparently have retained
the cellulolytic enzyme exo-1,4- ¯-glucanase
(Highley, 1975; Nilsson and Ginns, 1979;
Green and Highley, 1997; Worrall et al., 1997).
Most of these are members of theboleteclade,
in the genera Coniophora, Hygrophoropsis, Ser-
pula, and Paxillus , but a few brown rot fungi
not in the bolete clade also reportedly can
degrade pure cellulose in culture (e.g., Postia
andGloeophyllum [Nilsson, 1974]).
The evidence discussed above suggests
that certain lignin and cellulose-degrading
enzyme systems typically associated with
white rot have been retained in some groups
of brown rot fungi (Worrall et al., 1997). If
so, then transformations from white rot to
brown rot probably involve changes in the
expression patterns of genes for enzymes
involved in white rot (as well as gain of
the nonenzymatic mechanism of cellulose
depolymerization), rather than the absolute
loss of those genes. Worrall et al. (1997) noted
that in brown rot fungi, lignin degradation
(although limited) is most pronounced in late
stages of decay whereas in white rot fungi
selective deligni/bullet5cation is most pronounced
in early stages of decay; this supports the
view that the evolution of brown rot involves
changes in the timing of expression of genes
encoding lignin-degrading enzymes.
The apparent retention of genes encoding
lignin-modifying enzymes in some groups
of brown rot fungi has implications forthe expected loss:gain bias of brown rot.
If the genes for lignin-modifying enzymes
were lost from the genomes of brown rot
fungi, then presumably reversals to white
rot would be unlikely. However, if lignin-
modifying enzymes were retained in some
groups of brown rot fungi, then reversals
to white rot might be possible. We inferred
that one such reversal may have happened
in the case of the white rot fungus Gri-
fola frondosa , which may be nested among
brown rot fungi in the Antrodia clade (Fig. 3).
Alternative topologies suggesting that the
white rot condition of Grifola is plesiomor-
phic could not be rejected. Nevertheless, sev-
eral brown rot members of the Antrodia clade
have been shown to have lignin-degrading
activity in culture, including Oligoporus frag-
ilis(represented in this study by O. rennyi) ,
which shows evidence of “vestigial” extra-
cellular phenoloxidase activity (Worrall et al.,
1997:217), and Piptoporus betulinus , which has
MNP activity in culture (Szklarz et al., 1989).
Thus, a reversal to white rot in Grifola could
have involved shifts in expression patterns
of retained lignin-modifying enzymes.
Mating system.— Forty-/bullet5ve species (34%)
were scored as tetrapolar and 15 species were
scored as bipolar (11%). Equally weighted
parsimony optimizations on unconstrained
trees optimized as tetrapolar 50–57 of the
taxa that had been scored as missing and op-
timized 16–23 as bipolar (total scored plus
inferred: 95–102 species [71–77%] tetrapo-
lar; 31–38 species [23–29%] bipolar). These
proportions compare well with /bullet5gures from
Esser (1967), which suggest that /c18725% of ho-
mobasidiomycetes are bipolar.
At a 1:1 loss:gain cost ratio, 10 MPRs
of mating system are found on the uncon-
strained trees. All 10 MPRs suggest that
tetrapolar mating systems are plesiomorphic
in the homobasidiomycetes, as suggested by
Raper and Flexer (1971; contra Nobles, 1971,
Ryvarden, 1991) (Fig. 3), and six transfor-
mations from tetrapolar to bipolar mating
systems have taken place, with no reversals
(Fig. 3; Table 4). This inference is generally
robust at 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1 loss:gain cost ratios
on all trees. However, at a 1:1 loss:gain cost
ratio, some trees that were produced under
constraint one suggest only /bullet5ve transforma-
tions from tetrapolar to bipolar mating sys-
tems and one reversal (Table 4). At lower
loss:gain cost ratios, the inferred number of
gains of bipolarity decreases, however, and at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 234 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 50
at a 1:3 loss:gain cost ratio, all three sets of
trees support some MPRs that suggest a sin-
gle origin of bipolar mating systems, with nu-
merous (6–13) reversals to tetrapolar mating
systems (Table 4).
At a 1:1 loss:gain cost ratio, the largest
clade of bipolar species is a weakly sup-
ported (bootstrap <50%) group of 24 species
in the polyporoid clade, which includes the
brown rot Antrodia clade and its sister group,
a group of 10 white rot species we refer to as
the “ Phlebia clade” (Figs. 2, 3). Mating type
has been recorded in just 9 species of the
Antrodia clade and Phlebia clade; the states
in the remaining 15 taxa have been inferred
from the equally weighted parsimony opti-
mization (Fig. 3).
The view that tetrapolarity is plesiomor-
phic in the homobasidiomycetes (Raper and
Flexer, 1971) is supported by the fact that the
heterobasidiomycete Auriculariales, which
is supported as the sister group of the ho-
mobasidiomycetes, is tetrapolar (Figs. 1, 3).
However, our ancestral state reconstructions
may grossly underestimate the number of
transformations in mating type that have
taken place within the homobasidiomycetes
because 73 species (55%) could not be scored
for mating system. With so many missing
data, parsimony optimizations could eas-
ily have underestimated the actual number
of transformations. Moreover, the distribu-
tion of bipolar and tetrapolar mating sys-
tems among some putatively closely related
species of homobasidiomycetes suggests that
mating systems are fairly labile. For exam-
ple, the genera Sistotrema, Marasmius, Colly-
bia, and Coprinus each contain both tetrapo-
lar and bipolar species (Lange, 1952; Raper
and Flexer, 1971; Murphy and Miller, 1993;
Petersen, 1995). To obtain more realistic es-
timates of the number of transformations in
mating systems, one will need to obtain more
baseline data on mating systems in homoba-
sidiomycetes and perform ancestral state re-
constructions by using more comprehensive
phylogenetic trees of homobasidiomycetes
than those in the present study.
As with decay mode, our results provide a
phylogenetic framework for studying the ge-
netic basis of transformations between mat-
ing systems. Theoretical and empirical stud-
ies suggest that switches from tetrapolar to
bipolar mating systems could occur by at
least two mechanisms: (1) “self-compatible”
mutations at either the A orB mating typelociof tetrapolar mating systems could create ef-
fectively bipolar mating systems (Raper and
Flexer, 1971; Casselton and K¨ ues, 1994), and
(2) chromosome rearrangements that bring
A and B loci into tight linkage groups could
convert tetrapolar mating systems to bipolar
mating systems (Bakkeren et al., 1992). Stud-
ies on the genetic architecture of the puta-
tively independently derived bipolar mating
systems could help re/bullet5ne hypotheses of ho-
mology in this character.
Conifer decay ability.— Fifty-seven species
were scored as unable to decay conifer wood,
and 74 species were scored as able to de-
cay conifer wood (such taxa may or may
not decay other substrates). Ancestral state
reconstructions of conifer decay ability are
ambiguous. At a 1:1 loss:gain cost ratio,
tree 1 from the unconstrained analysis has
264 MPRs, suggesting 12–30 losses of conifer
decay ability, and 5–24 gains (Fig. 4). Never-
theless, all MPRs suggest that the plesiomor-
phic condition of the homobasidiomycetes
is to possess the ability to decay conifers
(Fig. 4).
Conifer exclusivity.— Conifer exclusivity
has a much more limited distribution than
conifer decay ability. We scored 116 species
as not occurring exclusively on conifers
and 16 species as occurring exclusively on
conifers. The ancestral condition of the ho-
mobasidiomycetes is to lack conifer exclu-
sivity. At a 1:1 loss:gain cost ratio, the three
sets of trees suggest 0–4 losses of conifer ex-
clusivity and 8–12 gains (Fig. 4; Table 4). At
loss:gain cost ratios of 3:1 or 2:1, all trees sug-
gest 11–12 gains of conifer exclusivity and
no reversals. At lower loss:gain cost ratios,
however, the number of inferred losses in-
creased, and at a 1:3 loss:gain cost ratio, 4–
21 losses and 2–8 gains were inferred (Table
4). Together, the parsimony optimizations of
conifer decay ability and conifer exclusivity
suggest that the plesiomorphic condition of
the homobasidiomycetes is to be a generalist,
able to decay conifers and other substrates,
although scattered shifts to a specialization
for conifer substrates have occurred. How-
ever, the precise number of such shifts (and
possible reversals) is sensitive tothe assumed
loss:gain cost ratio.

system, and conifer exclusivity. However, we
decided not to perform any CCTs for the al-
ternative substrate range character, conifer
decay ability. All 264 MPRs of conifer decay
ability suggested that the capacity to decay
conifer wood is a widespread plesiomorphic
character in the homobasidiomycetes. There-
fore, we felt it unlikely that evidence would
suggest the ability to decay conifers is either
a cause or consequence of the evolution of
brown rot or bipolar mating systems, both
of which appear to be highly derived condi-
tions. In addition, the ambiguous ancestral
state reconstruction of conifer decay ability
(Fig. 4) would make it dif/bullet5cult to use this
character in the CCT.
No changes in decay mode or mating sys-
tem were inferred to have occurred within
clades that are distinguished by having
conifer exclusivity. Therefore, we investi-
gated possible causal relationships involv-
ing the following pairs of characters (the /bullet5rst
character listed being the putatively inde-
pendent character): (1) decay mode versus
conifer exclusivity; (2) decay mode ver-
sus mating system; (3) mating system ver-
sus conifer exclusivity; and (4) mating system
versus decay mode (Table 5). We performed
the CCT under different MPRs and assump-
tions regarding the sequence of changes in
branches where both characters were in-
ferred to have changed (Table 5). In total, 11
CCTs were performed. Therefore, all Pval-
ues were multiplied by 11 to correct for mul-
tiple tests.
Three of the correlations were found to be
nonsigni/bullet5cant, including that between evo-
lution of a brown rot and evolution of bipo-lar mating systems. Without considering the
phylogeny, ths result was somewhat surpris-
ing because 16 of 20 brown rot species in
our dataset were scored as having bipolar
mating systems. However, ancestral state re-
constructions suggest that the bipolar brown
rot species represent just two independent
clades (Fig. 3). The larger of the two is the
Antrodia clade, which includes 13 species
(and is weakly supported as the sister group
of the bipolar white rot Phlebia clade). The re-
maining bipolar brown rot species are in the
Gloeophyllum clade. Depending on the inter-
pretation of simultaneous changes in decay
mode and mating system on the branch lead-
ing to the Gloeophyllum clade, only one or two
derivations of brown rot are localized within
bipolar clades, which is not signi/bullet5cantly dif-
ferent from a pattern of association that could
be expected by chance (Table 5). These results
illustrate the danger of inferring causal rela-
tionships among characters in an ahistorical
framework.
The only character comparison that re-
turned a signi/bullet5cant correlation was decay
mode versus conifer exclusivity, but this was
sensitive to the choice of MPR of conifer
exclusivity (Table 5). Ten MPRs of conifer
exclusivity were inferred by using equally
weighted parsimony optimizations, requir-
ing 8–12 gains and 0–4 losses. In addition, si-
multaneous gains in conifer exclusivity and
decay mode were inferred on the branch
leading to Paxillus panuoides . Under MPR1
of conifer exclusivity (0 losses, 12 gains),
5–6 gains could be localized within brown
rot clades, depending on how the simul-

Paxillus were interpreted. This correlation
was deemed signi/bullet5cant by the CCT ( PD
0.022 if /bullet5ve gains of conifer exclusivity are
inferred in brown rot clades; PD0.011 if six
gains are inferred). However, under MPR10
of conifer exclusivity (four losses, eight
gains), only two to three gains were inferred
within brown rot clades, which was not sig-
ni/bullet5cant after correcting for multiple tests.
To explore the sensitivity of the correla-
tion between decay mode and conifer exclu-
sivity to alternative tree topologies, we per-
formed the CCT by using one tree from each
of the remaining six islands discovered in the
unconstrained analysis, as well as one tree
from each of the two constrained analyses
(Table 6). There were 5–10 MPRs of conifer
exclusivity on the eight trees examined. In
every tree, the MPR of conifer exclusivity that
maximized gains showed /bullet5ve to six gains of
conifer exclusivity in brown rot clades, which
was signi/bullet5cant ( PD0.001–0.018; uncorrected
Pvalues), whereas the MPR that maximized
losses had two to three such gains, which
was only marginally signi/bullet5cant or nonsignif-
icant ( PD0.047–0.300; uncorrected Pvalues;
Table 6).
As a complement to the CCT, we used the
ML test in Discrete to evaluate the correla-
tion between brown rot and conifer exclu-
sivity that was suggested by (some) CCTs.
The best-/bullet5t model with nine free parame-
ters had ¡logL(D9)D71:936, whereas the
best-/bullet5t model with eight free parametershad¡log L(D8)D74:069. The likelihood ra-
tio statistic for the best-/bullet5t models from each
class is 4.266, which is signi/bullet5cant (0 :05>P>
0:025). In the optimal nine-parameter model,
the rate parameter specifying the probabil-
ity of a shift to conifer substrates when the
background condition is white rot is 0.018,
whereas when the background condition is
brown rot the rate parameter is 0.163. These
results suggest that the instantaneous prob-
ability of a shift to conifer exclusivity is ap-
proximately nine times greater in brown rot
clades than in white rot clades.
The hypothesis of a causal relationship
between brown rot and conifer exclusiv-
ity was supported by both the CCT and
the ML method implemented in Discrete
(Tables 4–6). Although these two methods
supported similar conclusions, they evalu-
ate character correlations by very different
approaches. In the CCT, the test of character
correlation is based on fully resolved ances-
tral state reconstructions for each of the char-
acters of interest. This is problematic for two
reasons: (1) the ancestral state reconstruc-
tions depend on assumed loss:gain cost ra-
tios, which must be speci/bullet5ed a priori; and (2)
there are often multiple MPRs for each char-
acter, which increases the number of tests that
must be performed (simultaneous inferred
changes exacerbate this problem [Maddison,
1990]). These problems were manifested in
our study: Under the CCT, conclusions re-
garding the correlation between brown rot at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 2001 HIBBETT AND DONOGHUE—EVOLUTION OF WOOD DECAY MECHANISMS 237
and conifer exclusivity were sensitive to the
choice among MPRs and the interpretation
of simultaneous changes (Tables 4, 5). More-
over, the ancestral state reconstructions that
formed the basis of the CCT were often sensi-
tive to variation in loss:gain cost ratios (Table
4). Considering all this, the results of the CCT
are rather ambiguous.
In contrast to the CCT, the ML method in
Discrete estimates the probabilities of char-
acter state transformations directly from the
hypothesized phylogeny and the states of
the terminal taxa. In addition, the likelihood
scores used to evaluate competing models
of evolution are calculated over all possible
combinations of ancestral states. Thus, the
ML method does not involve as many as-
sumptions about evolutionary history and
process as the CCT. Nevertheless, certain
sources of error affect both methods, in-
cluding error in the estimation of the phy-
logenetic tree itself (Donoghue and Ack-
erly, 1996). We assessed the sensitivity of
our results to alternative tree topologies by
performing the CCT over a range of equally
parsimonious trees (picking trees from differ-
ent islands in an attempt to maximize topo-
logical disparity) as well as two suboptimal
trees that could not be rejected by the WSR
test (Table 6). All trees yielded similar re-
sults, including sensitivity to the choice of
MPRs.
The results of our sensitivity analyses re-
call those of Donoghue and Ackerly (1996),
who studied correlations in simulated and
empirical characters on a range of equally
parsimonious trees, suboptimal trees, and
random trees. Overall, these authors found
that conclusions regarding character correla-
tions were generally robust to choices among
equally parsimonious or marginally subop-
timal trees, but inferences based on ran-
dom trees were no more reliable than those
that did not take phylogeny into account at
all. Their results, and ours in the present
study, suggest that causal interactions among
characters may often be detectable across a
range of plausible trees, which is encourag-
ing for comparative studies of large taxo-
nomic groups. However, this may not be true
in all cases, so topological sensitivity analy-
ses should be a routine component of com-
parative studies. In particular, trees that im-
ply alternative patterns of evolution in the
focal characters should be investigated. For
example, in this study we examined subop-timal trees that force the monophyly of the
Antrodia clade and the Gloeophyllum clade,
both of which include brown rot species.
The constrained trees that show the Antro-
diaclade and the Gloeophyllum clade to be
monophyletic imply one fewer gain of brown
rot than the optimal trees (Table 4). Never-
theless, the correlation between brown rot
and conifer exclusivity was upheld on this
topology (again, depending on the choice of
MPRs).
Another potential source of error in com-
parative analyses is incomplete or biased
taxon sampling (Maddison, 1990; Sill´ en-
Tullberg, 1993; H¨ oglund and Sill´ en-Tullberg,
1994; Werdelin and Tullberg, 1995; Donoghue
and Ackerly, 1996; Hillis, 1998; Lorch and
Eadie, 1999; Ree and Donoghue, 1999). For
example, Sill´ en-Tullberg (1993) and H¨ oglund
and Sill´ en-Tullberg (1994) described cases in
which conclusions based on the CCT were
overturned based on a repeat application of
the test with an increased sample of taxa.
Similarly, Ree and Donoghue (1999) found
that ML estimates of transformation proba-
bilities may be quite sensitive to taxon sam-
pling. Ree and Donoghue estimated the rate
of gains versus losses of zygomorphic (bi-
laterally symmetric) /bullet6owers in angiosperms
by using Discrete. With an initial sample
of 379 species, asymmetry in the rate of
losses versus gains was signi/bullet5cant (favoring
losses), but when the number of zygomor-
phic species was doubled, to better re/bullet6ect the
actual proportion of described zygomorphic
species, the asymmetry became nonsigni/bullet5-
cant. A general implication of these studies is
that comparativeanalyses of character evolu-
tion should be based on samples of taxa that
re/bullet6ect, as nearly as possible, the actual phylo-
genetic distribution of species and character
states.
Our data set included a diverse, fairly
comprehensive sampling of homobasid-
iomycetes. Nevertheless, sampling bias is ev-
ident in the distribution of taxa as well as
character states. Overrepresented categories
include the polyporoid clade and brown
rot species, whereas underrepresented cate-
gories include the euagarics clade (Table 3).
We will continue to add taxa to our data
set, with the goal of making the sampling
of clades and character states more repre-
sentative of the actual proportions. In the
meantime, given our current best estimates
of the phylogeny (Figs. 1, 2), we conclude at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 238 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 50
that the repeated evolution of brown rot has
promoted repeated shifts to conifer exclusiv-
ity in homobasidiomycetes (Tables 4–6).
Two hypotheses have been proposed to
explain the apparent correlation between
brown rot and decay of conifer substrates.
Gilbertson (1980) suggested that brown rot
and conifer decay are correlated because
the short growing seasons and other en-
vironmental factors of conifer-dominated
forests favor brown rot fungi. A corollary of
Gilbertson’s (1980) hypothesis is that the fre-
quency of brown rot fungi should increase
on all substrate types in conifer-dominated
forests, not just on conifer wood. How-
ever, studies in the boreal forests of Lapland
(Renvall et al., 1991) and Northern Qu´ ebec
(Niemel¨ a, 1985) suggest that even in these
extreme, conifer-dominated environments,
brown rot fungi show a preference for conifer
substrates. Speci/bullet5cally, Renvall et al. (1991)
found that 15 (75%) of 20 brown rot species
were exclusively found on conifers, com-
pared with 26 (49%) of 53 white rot species,
and Niemel¨ a (1985) found that 9 (82%)
of 11 brown rot species were exclusively
found on conifers, compared with 9 (45%)
of 20 white rot species. These observations
suggest that the correlation between brown
rot and decay of conifer substrates cannot be
explained solely by environmental factors.
An alternative explanation for the cor-
relation between brown rot and decay of
conifer substrates was proposed by Rayner
and Boddy (1988), who suggested that brown
rot fungi, which do not extensively decay
lignin, are most prevalent on conifer wood
because the lignins of conifers are more re-
sistant to decay than the lignins of hard-
woods. If some physical or chemical prop-
erty of conifer wood enhances the growth
or competitive ability of brown rot fungi,
then quantitative measures of decay (e.g.,
substrate weight loss [Worrall et al., 1997])
may be useful for detecting differences in
the relative abilities of brown rot and white
rot fungi to decay hardwood versus conifer
substrates. With appropriate taxonomic sam-
pling, empirical data from laboratory de-
cay studies could be used in phylogenetic
comparative analyses to test whether shifts
in decay abilities correlate with transforma-
tions between decay modes. For example,
one could use the ML method of Pagel (in
Lutzoni and Pagel, 1997), which allows com-
parisons of continuous characters (e.g., de-cay ability) and discrete characters (e.g., de-
cay mode). If such analyses suggested that
brown rot confers a performance advantage
on conifer substrates, then further mechanis-
tic studies would be warranted to elucidate
the biochemical basis of the correlation be-
tween brown rot and conifer exclusivity.
Conclusions
Our study inferred historical patterns of
evolution in decay mode, mating type, and
substrate range characters and assessed prior
hypotheses of causal relationships among
them. Earlier attempts to address these is-
sues have been handicapped by the lack of
phylogenetic hypotheses of the homobasid-
iomycetes. The ancestral condition of de-
cay mode and mating type have been es-
pecially controversial (Nobles, 1965, 1971;
Raper and Flexer, 1971; Gilbertson, 1980;
Watling, 1982; Ryvarden, 1991). Our /bullet5nd-
ings suggest that the ancestor of the ho-
mobasidiomycetes was a white rot, tetrapo-
lar fungus, and that brown rot and bipolarity
have evolved repeatedly. The ability to de-
cay conifer substrates is plesiomorphic and
widespread in the homobasidiomycetes, but
conifer exclusivity is a specialized, derived
condition.
Gilbertson (1980) noted that a dispropor-
tional number of fungi that produce a brown
rot grow on conifer wood and have bipo-
lar mating systems. Consequently, he in-
ferred that there is a causal relationship
among these characters. We decomposed
Gilbertson’s hypothesis into three pairwise
character comparisons. Two of the compar-
isons, brown rot versus bipolarity and conifer
exclusivity versus bipolarity, yielded non-
signi/bullet5cant correlations. Thus, our results do
not support the view that the evolution of
bipolar mating systems is either a cause or
a consequence of the evolution of brown
rot or conifer exclusivity. Previous conclu-
sions about causal factors in the evolution
of bipolar mating systems appear to be in er-
ror because they were based on an ahistori-
cal approach that implicitly treats the charac-
ter states of different species as independent
(Gilbertson,1980).
The only signi/bullet5cant correlation we found
is that between brown rot and conifer exclu-
sivity. Gilbertson (1980) predicted these char-
acters should be correlated but did not spec-
ify the relative timing of the origin of brown at Yale University on August 3, 2013 http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 2001 HIBBETT AND DONOGHUE—EVOLUTION OF WOOD DECAY MECHANISMS 239
rot and the colonization of conifers. Our re-
sults suggest that the evolution of brown rot
has often preceded the evolution of conifer
exclusivity. However, conifer exclusivity has
also evolved at least /bullet5ve or six times within
white rot clades (Figs. 3, 4, Tables 3, 4). Appar-
ently, brown rot confers a greater tendency
toward shifts to conifer exclusivity than does
white rot, but it is not essential for conifer
exclusivity.
