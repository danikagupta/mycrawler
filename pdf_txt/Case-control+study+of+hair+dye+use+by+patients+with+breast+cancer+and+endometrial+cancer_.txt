Abstract
BACKGROUND: Building upon our earlier findings of significant associations between hair 
dye and relaxer use with increased breast cancer risk, we evaluated associations of select 
characteristics of use with breast tumor clinicopathology.
METHODS: Using multivariable-adjusted models we examined the associations of interest in a 
case-only study of 2,998 women with breast cancer, overall and stratified by race and estrogen 
receptor (ER) status, addressing multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction.
RESULTS: Compared to salon application of permanent hair dye, home kit and combination 
application (both salon and home kit application) were associated with increased odds of poorly 
differentiated tumors in the overall sample. This association was consistent among Black (home 
kit: OR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.21–5.00; combination: OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.21–5.00), but not White 
women, and among ER+ (home kit: OR 1.47, 95% CI: 0.82–2.63; combination: OR 2.98, 95% CI: 
1.62–5.49) but not ER− cases. Combination application of relaxers was associated with increased 
odds of tumors >2.0 cm vs. <1.0 cm (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.23–2.69). Longer duration and earlier 
use of relaxers and combination application of permanent hair dyes and relaxers were associated 
with breast tumor features including higher tumor grade and larger tumor size, which often denote 
more aggressive phenotypes, although the findings did not maintain significance with Bonferroni 
correction.
CONCLUSIONS: These novel data support reported associations between hair dye and relaxer 
use with breast cancer, showing for the first time, associations with breast tumor clinicopathologic 
features. Improved hair product exposure measurement is essential for fully understanding the 
impact of these environmental exposure with breast cancer and to guide risk reduction strategies in 
the future.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in the United States, 
and accounts for the second highest cancer mortality rate (after lung cancer) ( 1). Clinically, 
Black women tend to be diagnosed with more aggressive breast cancers (e.g., characterized 
as poorly differentiated and hormone receptor-negative [HR−], with a greater propensity 
for positive lymph node status and metastasis) compared to White women ( 1, 2). Further, 
the triple-negative (TN) subtype—associated with the worst prognosis—has the highest 
incidence among Black women compared to women of other races/ethnicities ( 2). Of 
interest, use of hair dyes and relaxers is a suspected risk factor for breast cancer ( 3–26), 
though a causal relationship between this exposure and breast cancer risk has not been 
established. Most recently, it has been hypothesized to be associated with disparities in 
breast cancer phenotype ( 6, 13).Rao et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptHair products (and other personal care products) are environmental sources of exposure 
to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and mutagenic and/or genotoxic compounds, 
which are suspected contributors to breast carcinogenesis. Although the intended use of 
these products is topical, chemicals can gain systemic access through the skin. Data have 
shown greater use of EDC-containing hair products, including chemical relaxers ( 5, 13, 20, 
27) and use of hair products that contain more harmful chemicals ( 28, 29) among Black 
women compared to their White counterparts. Furthermore, evidence supports that initiation 
of use of EDC-containing hair products occur at an earlier age among Black women and 
childhood use has been associated with earlier puberty ( 5, 27). Therefore, not only does 
early exposure to EDC-containing hair products increase cumulative lifetime exposure to 
potentially harmful compounds, but these products are also implicated as a contributor to 
earlier pubertal timing ( 30–32), which is in an important risk factor for breast cancer. In 
addition, while findings from several epidemiologic studies have historically suggested that 
hair dye use is associated with increased risk of hematopoietic neoplasms ( 14, 22, 33–35) 
and bladder cancer ( 24, 36–38), emerging data have suggested a positive association with 
breast cancer as well ( 6, 8, 13, 39). A meta-analysis examining the association between hair 
dye use and breast cancer risk in eight studies (N = 38,037) suggested a significant dose­
dependent relationship ( 40). Recent findings from the Nurse’s Health Study suggested that 
cumulative dose of permanent hair dye use was associated with increased risk of estrogen 
receptor negative (ER−), progesterone receptor negative (PR−), and HR− breast cancer, 
albeit in a cohort of predominantly non-Hispanic White (NHW) healthcare professionals 
(39). At present, however, a causal association between increased use of hair dyes and 
development of breast cancer cannot be confirmed.
In the current study, we sought to expand upon our earlier analysis in the Women’s Circle of 
Health Study (WCHS), in which we observed significant associations between hair dye and 
relaxer use and breast cancer risk among Black and White women ( 13). In particular, here 
we examined whether certain characteristics of use of hair dyes and relaxers are associated 
with more aggressive tumor features, including larger tumor size, higher tumor grade, 
negative HR status, positive lymph node status, and tumor subtype – all of which play some 
role in prognostication, whether it is predicting survival outcome or recurrence risk, and 
have been associated with disease progression ( 41–43). Specifically, we hypothesized that 
greater duration and magnitude of exposure to hair dyes and relaxers, use of darker shades 
of hair dye and lye-based relaxers, as well as joint use of dyes and relaxers are associated 
with more aggressive tumor features. Given findings from our earlier analysis ( 13) and 
data from other studies ( 6, 39) suggesting potential differences in associations between hair 
product use and breast cancer by ER status, we hypothesized that the associations with 
tumor clinicopathologic features might also differ by ER status. With regards to application 
of hair dyes and relaxers, we hypothesized that home kit or combination of home kit and 
salon application, compared to salon application alone, are associated with more aggressive 
tumor features due to the possibility that self-application of these hair products (rather than 
having them applied by a professional in a salon setting) might equate to higher levels of 
exposure to potentially harmful chemicals. We examined the associations of interest with 
the hope of further understanding the role this particular environmental risk factor may play Rao et al. Page 3

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Participants
As previously described, the WCHS was a case–control study conducted in metropolitan 
New York City (NYC) and ten counties in New Jersey (NJ) ( 13). The current study 
included participants recruited from 2001 to 2018. Women with histologically confirmed 
ductal carcinoma in situ  or invasive breast cancer (stages I–IV) who self-identified as 
either Black/African American or White/European American, were age 20–75 years, able 
to complete an interview in English, and had completed the baseline interview by the 
end of 2018 were eligible to participate. In 2014, recruitment of Black/African American 
cases in NJ continued with the establishment of the Women’s Circle of Health Follow-up 
Study (WCHFS), a cohort of Black/African American breast cancer survivors in New Jersey 
(44). In the current case-only analysis, we included 2,998 breast cancer cases (2,227 Black 
and 771 White) who enrolled in the WCHS and WCHFS through 2018 and had complete 
baseline interview data available for analysis.
Data Collection
Data collection for the WCHS and WCHFS was conducted through in-person home visits 
approximately 9 months after diagnosis and included computer-assisted interviewing to 
administer questionnaires. Information on sociodemographic variables as well as established 
and probable breast cancer risk factors, including: family and personal health history, 
prenatal exposures, reproductive history, hormone use, and lifestyle factors (e.g., hair 
product use, tobacco smoke exposure, alcohol consumption, physical activity, dietary 
supplement use) were ascertained. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist 
and hip circumferences and body composition measures) were also taken during the 
interview, using standardized protocols and instruments ( 45). Use of permanent hair dye and 
chemical relaxer/straightener were assessed in interviewer-administered questionnaires ( 13). 
Questions ascertained history of permanent hair dye use and patterns of use, non-inclusive 
of semi-permanent or temporary hair dye. Regular hair dye use was defined as ‘having ever 
used permanent hair dye for at least 1 year at a rate of ≥2 times per year’. Regular chemical 
relaxer use (referred to as ‘relaxer’ hereafter) was defined as ‘having ever chemically relaxed 
or straightened hair for at least 1 year’. Data on hair product use characteristics were also 
collected and included the following: total duration (years) of hair dye use (≤10 years, >10 
years); typical shade of hair dye used (light [blonde, light brown], medium [medium brown, 
red], dark [dark brown, black]); typical application mechanism of hair dyes (salon, home 
kit, combination [both home kit and salon application]); total duration (years) of relaxer use 
(≤10 years, >10 years); early relaxer use (did not use before age 12, used before age 12); 
typical application mechanism of relaxers (salon, home kit, combination); and joint use of 
hair dyes and relaxers (user of hair dye only, user of relaxer only, user of both hair dye and 
relaxer). Reporting the application of hair dyes and relaxers as both at the salon and at home 
is hereafter referred to as ‘combination application’.Rao et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptTumor clinicopathology data were abstracted from pathology records. Tumor grade was 
defined as grades 1 (well differentiated), 2 (moderately differentiated), and 3 (poorly 
differentiated). Tumor size (cm) was classified into three categories: <1.0 cm, 1.0–2.0 cm, 
and >2.0 cm. American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage data was recorded as 
stages 0 through IV . Lymph node status was defined as node negative or node positive, based 
on the presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes. We used surrogate classifications 
for ER status, PR status, and HER2 status, which were based on IHC expression of ER and 
PR, and overexpression of HER2 (by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]). 
Of note, in WCHS and WCHFS, ER and PR status were classified as positive if ≥10% of 
cells demonstrated positive staining and negative if <10% of cells demonstrated positive 
staining (rather than using the 1% threshold that is used clinically ( 46)). Using the surrogate 
classifications for ER, PR, and HER2 status, we approximated breast tumor subtype into 
three mutually exclusive, clinically-recognized subtypes: luminal A (HR+/HER2− ), HER2­
positive (HR+ or HR−/HER2+), and TN (HR−/HER2−).
This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration 
of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of all participating 
institutions. All study participants provided written informed consent prior to study 
enrollment.
Statistical Analysis
Participant sociodemographic information, hair product use characteristics, and tumor 
clinicopathology were described using summary statistics (frequencies and proportions for 
categorical variables and means and standard deviation for continuous variables). Ordinal, 
logistic or polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios 
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to describe associations between hair product 
use (hair dyes, chemical relaxers, or both) and tumor characteristics. Initially, we used 
unadjusted logistic regression models for those with only two outcomes (e.g., ER status) 
and unadjusted polytomous logistic regression models for tumor characteristics with more 
than two discrete outcomes (e.g., tumor size). We then fit multivariable models, adjusting for 
potential cofounders that were selected a priori , including race (except for the race-stratified 
analyses), age, BMI, family history of breast cancer, oral contraceptive use, education level 
(as a proxy for socioeconomic status), and mode of initial detection (as a proxy for access 
and utilization of mammography screening). In our models, the referent groups were as 
follows: 1) ‘never-users’ for regular hair dye use, duration of hair dye use, and typical 
shade of dye used; 2) ‘salon application’ for typical application of hair dyes or relaxers; 3) 
‘never-users’ for regular relaxer use, duration of relaxer use, and early relaxer use; 4) ‘light 
hair dye shade’ for typical shade of dye; and 5) ‘never-users of both hair dyes and relaxers’ 
for joint use of hair dyes and relaxers. Bonferroni correction was used to address multiple 
comparisons. Cochran-Armitage trend tests were performed to evaluate trend effects of 
duration of exposure to hair dye and relaxer use on the outcome variables, as well as 
trends for the associations with tumor size and tumor grade. Primary analysis focused on 
associations in the overall sample and secondary analysis examined the associations of 
interest stratified by race and by ER status (shown in Supplementary Tables). Analyses Rao et al. Page 5

RESULTS
Select characteristics of the study sample
There were more Black women in the study sample (2,227 Black vs. 771 White) because the 
WCHS stopped recruiting White breast cancer cases in 2012, while enrollment of new Black 
breast cancer cases continued beyond 2012. The current analysis included White women 
diagnosed with breast cancer between 2001 and 2009 and Black women diagnosed with 
breast cancer between 2001 through 2018. Overall, the mean age at diagnosis was 53.3±10.6 
years. Most demographic, clinical and reproductive characteristics differed by race, with the 
exception of age at menarche and history of oral contraceptive use (Table 1). As previously 
reported in WCHS ( 47), there were notable differences in breast tumor clinicopathologic 
features by race, indicating that Black women were more likely to be diagnosed with 
tumors that exhibited more aggressive phenotypes. This included more frequently having 
tumors that were poorly differentiated, >2.0 cm, ER−, lymph node positive, and TN subtype 
compared to White women.
Prevalence of regular use of permanent hair dye (35.5% vs. 62.1%, P<0.001) was lower 
and relaxer use was higher (88.1% vs. 7.7%, P<0.001) among Black than White women, 
respectively (Table 2). Significant racial differences were also observed for each hair product 
use characteristic examined. Notable differences included a larger proportion of White 
women reporting long-term use of permanent hair dye (>10 years) and more frequent 
use of salon application among White women compared to Black women. In terms of 
relaxer use, as previously reported in WCHS ( 13), a significantly larger proportion of Black 
women reported long-term use of relaxers and use of these products before age 12 years. 
Comparisons between users and non-users of hair dye and relaxer confirmed that age, race, 
education, and family history of breast cancer are potential confounders of the association 
between hair dye use and breast cancer, while race, education, BMI, family history of breast 
cancer, and history of oral contraceptive use are potential confounders for the associations of 
relaxer use and breast cancer (Supplementary Table 1).
Associations of hair product use characteristics with breast tumor clinicopathology
Permanent Hair Dye Use— No statistically significant associations were observed 
between regular use of permanent hair dye and any tumor clinicopathologic features (Table 
3). However, we found that among women reporting >10 years of hair dye use, there 
appeared to be borderline significant increase in the odds of higher tumor grade, although 
the trend test was not significant. Notably, compared to salon only application, use of home 
kit only and combination (salon and home kit) application of permanent hair dyes were 
associated with increased odds of higher tumor grade and with larger tumor size. Only the 
association of combination application with increased odds of poorly differentiated tumor 
grade was statistically significant upon controlling for multiple comparisons (OR 2.27, 
95% CI: 1.36–3.82), despite a statistically non-significant trend. In sensitivity analysis, this 
finding remained significant among women ≥50 years (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.36–4.47), while Rao et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptamong women <50 the estimate was imprecise (OR 2.68, 95% CI: 0.92–7.84). Typical hair 
dye shade used was not associated with breast tumor clinicopathologic features.
In race-stratified models, unexpectedly, among Black women reporting ≤10 years of hair 
dye use, there were significantly decreased odds of tumors >2.0 cm (OR 0.69, 95% CI: 
0.53–0.89; Table 4). Use of permanent hair dye for >10 years, as well as home kit and 
combination application of hair dye were associated with increased odds of higher tumor 
grade. Home kit (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.10–4.44) and combination application (OR = 
2.46, 95% CI: 1.12–5.00) of dyes were positively associated with poorly differentiated 
tumors among Black women. Conversely, among White women (Table 5), there was a 
non-significant association between combination application of hair dyes with higher tumor 
grade. We also observed that among White women who reported using hair dye for >10 
years, there were lower odds of positive lymph node status (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27–0.79), 
which was not observed among Black women.
Relaxer Use— Compared to non-use of relaxers, there appeared to be an inverse 
association between regular use and reduced odds of higher tumor grade (P-trend = 0.037), 
although the risk estimates did not reach statistical significance (Table 6). Overall, duration 
of relaxer use >10 years (1.0–2.0 cm: OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.04–2.87) and use of relaxers 
before age 12 (1.0–2.0 cm: OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.02–2.68) were significantly associated 
with larger tumor size, although the risk estimates for tumors >2.0 cm hovered near 1.00. 
Among women reporting relaxer use >10 years there was a significant positive trend for 
increasing tumor size (P-trend = 0.0086). Relaxer use before and after age 12 appeared to be 
associated with increasing tumor size (P-trends = 0.021 and 0.015, respectively). Compared 
to salon only application, home kit (1.0–2.0 cm: OR 1.29, 95% CI: 0.85–1.97 and >2.0 cm: 
OR 1.45, 95% CI: 0.92–2.29) and combination application of relaxer was associated with 
increased odds of larger tumor size (1.0–2.0 cm: OR 1.34, 95% CI: 0.93–1.94 and >2.0 cm: 
OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.23–2.69); only the association of combination application with tumors 
>2.0 cm remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Sensitivity analysis 
indicated that the association between combination application of relaxers with tumors >2.0 
cm was consistent among women ≥50 years (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.07–3.07) and <50 years 
(OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.01–3.27). Joint use of hair dye and relaxer was not significantly 
associated with any tumor clinicopathology feature.
Among Black women, compared to salon only application, home kit (1.0–2.0 cm: OR 
1.31, 95% CI: 0.85–2.03 and >2.0 cm: OR 1.43, 95% CI: 0.90–2.27) and combination 
application (1.0–2.0 cm: OR 1.37, 95% CI: 0.94–1.99 and >2.0 cm: OR = 1.81, 95% 
CI: 1.22–2.88) of relaxers were associated with higher odds of larger tumors; again, only 
the association of combination application with tumors >2.0 cm remained significant after 
correction for multiple comparisons (Table 7). We were unable to assess associations of 
relaxer use characteristics with the outcomes of interest among White women due to their 
low prevalence of relaxer use.
Associations of hair dye and relaxer use with breast tumor clinicopathology, 
stratified by ER status— We also explored the associations of interest in analysis 
stratified by ER status. Among ER+ cases (Supplementary Table 2), we observed an inverse Rao et al. Page 7
Environ Res . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 January 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptassociation between regular hair dye use and both lymph node status and larger tumor size. 
Duration of hair dye use >10 years (moderately differentiated: OR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.87–1.87 
and poorly differentiated: OR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.12–2.56) and combination application 
of hair dye were associated with increased odds of higher tumor grade (moderately 
differentiated: OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.03–3.04 and poorly differentiated: OR = 2.98, 95% 
CI: 1.62–5.49). Among ER+ cases, no significant associations were observed for regular 
use, duration of relaxer use or with use before age 12. Combination application of relaxers 
was associated with increased odds of larger tumor size, but this association did not reach 
statistical significance upon correction for multiple comparisons.
Among ER− cases, regular use of relaxers was significantly associated with increased odds 
of positive lymph node status (OR 2.03, 95% CI: 1.11–3.86) (Supplementary Table 3). 
Relaxer use >10 years and use before age 12 were associated with increased odds of larger 
tumor size, HER2+ status, and positive lymph node status, although these associations were 
not significant upon correction for multiple comparisons. The association for combination 
application of relaxers with larger size was found among ER− cases as among ER+ cases. 
However, we also observed an inverse association between combination application of 
relaxers and positive lymph node status in ER− disease. Joint use of hair dyes and relaxers 
was associated with higher odds of positive lymph node status in ER− cases (OR 2.69, 95% 
CI: 1.15–6.80), which was not observed among ER+ cases (OR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.44, 1.02).
DISCUSSION
Hair dye and relaxer use has been shown to be associated with increased risk of breast 
cancer with estimates ranging from 10% to 70% greater risk ( 3, 6, 8, 13, 48). However, 
aside from earlier data from our group and others, which suggested differences in the 
associations of hair product use with breast cancer risk by ER status ( 6, 13, 26), no prior 
study has examined the associations of hair dye and relaxer use with breast tumor features 
including tumor grade, tumor size, receptor and lymph node status, and tumor subtype. 
This is the first step in assessing the potential impacts of these exposures on breast cancer 
prognostic indicators. In the current study, we demonstrated that, beyond ever vs. never 
use of permanent hair dyes and chemical relaxers, combination application of these hair 
products (having a history of both home kit application and salon application), longer 
duration of relaxer use, and relaxer use before age 12 years were associated with breast 
tumor clinicopathology. These findings generate new hypotheses about the potential impact 
of hair product use on breast cancer outcomes. We also conclude, based on our assessment 
of the exposures of interest, that crude measures of hair dye and relaxer use (i.e., ever 
vs. never) may be differentially associated with tumor characteristics, compared to more 
granular measures of use that potentially capture more cumulative measures of exposure 
(e.g., intensity). This warrants improvements in the classification of hair product exposures, 
especially hair dye, in future studies. We observed unexpected inverse associations in 
the analysis of ever-use and duration of hair dye use with tumor size and lymph node 
status, while combination application of hair dyes (compared to salon application only) 
were significantly associated with higher tumor grade, particularly among Black women. 
Similarly, duration and earlier use of relaxers, and combination application of relaxers Rao et al. Page 8

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptwere associated with increased tumor size. But, our findings did not support an association 
between joint use of hair dyes and relaxers with more aggressive tumor clinicopathology.
Epidemiologic evidence supports a significant association between hair dye use, race, and 
increased risk of breast cancer ( 6, 8, 13). While in our prior case-control analysis of WCHS 
we reported a null association between hair dye use and breast cancer among Black and 
White women, and a positive association between use of dark hair dye shades and increased 
breast cancer risk among Black women only (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.20–1.90) ( 13), here we 
show that neither regular hair dye use nor dark shades of hair dye were associated with 
aggressive tumor features. Unexpectedly, regular hair dye use was observed to be inversely 
associated with tumor size, with associations restricted to Black women and to ER+ cases. 
This suggests that, in the examination of associations between hair dye use and breast tumor 
features, more granular measures of hair dye use are needed to fully understand associations 
with breast cancer risk and with clinicopathologic characteristics. For example, application 
type tended to be associated with more aggressive clinicopathological features, while ever­
use generally was not, which could be an indication that compared to salon application, 
home kit and combination use (in particular) are important characteristics of hair dye use 
to consider. While the differences in association between crude and granular measures of 
hair dye use with tumor features requires further study, we also acknowledge that these 
differing associations could be attributed to women’s inability to distinguish between use of 
permanent vs. semi-permanent hair dye, which could impact reported estimates of hair dye 
use within the study sample and the associations with our outcomes of interest.
As noted above, hair dye application type was associated with aggressive tumor features. 
Specifically, we found that combination application (vs. salon only application) was 
associated with higher tumor grade. Combination application was associated with greater 
odds of poorly differentiated tumors; these findings were limited to ER+ breast cancer cases 
and to Black women. Overall, these findings suggest that hair dye application type has a 
stronger impact on hormone responsive breast cancer, especially when diagnosed in Black 
women.
We previously reported that, among Black women, the use of darker shades of hair dye 
(vs. lighter shades) is associated with 1.50-times greater odds of developing breast cancer 
(irrespective of ER status) ( 13). Our current findings suggest that the shade of hair dye used 
may be differentially associated with breast tumor clinicopathology. Use of medium or dark 
hair dyes was associated with reduced odds of ER− tumors among Black women. Moreover, 
use of medium hair dye shades was associated with larger tumors among ER− cases. These 
findings are interesting and might suggest that compared to light shades, darker shades of 
hair dye might have more of an adverse impact on breast tumor features in hormone receptor 
positive than negative tumor subtypes.
Limited epidemiologic evidence supports a positive association between regular relaxer 
use and increased breast cancer risk ( 3, 6, 26), as well as other hormone-sensitive organs 
such as the uterus ( 49). Our observations in the overall sample showed that duration 
of relaxer use >10 years and use before age 12 were associated with 72% and 65% 
greater odds of tumor sizes 1.0–2.0 cm (compared to <1.0 cm), respectively. These Rao et al. Page 9

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptfindings, along with the observation of significant trend of longer duration of hair dye 
use with ER− disease and earlier use of relaxer with larger tumors, point towards potential 
dose-dependent relationships that warrant further study. Evidence exists supporting a dose­
response relationship between hair dye use and breast cancer risk ( 40); most recently, in 
2020 Eberle et al. observed an increase in breast cancer risk associated with more frequent 
relaxer use ( 6). In ER− cases, compared to non-use, regular use of relaxer, >10 years of use, 
and use before age 12, as well as joint use of hair dye and relaxer were associated with 
significantly increased odds of positive lymph node status. This parallels the elevated risk 
for ER− invasive cancers and hair straightener use observed by Eberle and colleagues ( 6). 
These findings suggest that the intensity of exposure, due to longer duration of relaxer use 
and early use, may impact breast tumor clinicopathologic features. While duration of relaxer 
use >10 years was just shy of statistical significance, our findings highlight the need for 
accurately measuring intensity of exposure to hair products and other personal care products 
to understand their long-term effects on health outcomes. Future studies will need to confirm 
whether relaxer use habits closer to diagnosis and/or earlier in the life course are most 
relevant for associations with tumor phenotypes.
Combination application of relaxers (compared to salon application only) was significantly 
associated with increased odds of tumors >2.0 cm and the association remained strong 
independent of ER status, as well as among Black women. To our surprise, among women 
with ER− disease, combination application of relaxer was associated with lower odds 
of positive lymph nodes. Overall, all measures of relaxer use, crude or granular, were 
associated with more aggressive tumor features independent of breast cancer subtype. These 
findings are notable, particularly in comparison with findings of the large-scale Black 
Women’s Health Study, which had not found any substantial increase in breast cancer risk 
(17). While the mechanistic roles of hair dye and relaxer use on breast cancer biology is 
unclear, one hypothesis is that EDCs (and other harmful chemicals) in these products induce 
adverse hormonal and carcinogenic influences ( 6, 13, 20, 50–54).
There were some notable differences between the manner in which Black and White 
women used hair products, as well as in their breast cancer phenotypes. Black women 
were much less likely to report use of permanent hair dye than White women, but much 
more likely to report using relaxers (with duration of use >10 years) than White women. 
Despite these important differences in hair product use and characteristics of use, there 
was generally a consistency in the association of combination application (salon and home 
kit application) of hair products with poorer tumor grade, larger tumor size, and with 
HER2+ tumor status. This further highlights the point regarding capturing intensity of hair 
product exposure to get a fuller picture of its contribution to clinical outcomes in breast 
cancer. The potential to clarify the associations of hair dye and relaxer use with tumor 
clinicopathology and subsequent long-term breast cancer prognosis will ultimately rely on 
improved measurement of these environmental exposures. We posit that a combination 
of home kit and salon application of hair dyes and relaxers might correlate with greater 
exposure intensity ( 55, 56) to these products over shorter periods of time, which might 
have more of an impact on breast cancer risk and phenotype when the exposure occurs 
before and during pubertal development ( 5, 32, 57). It is also possible that home kits have 
more hazardous chemicals than salon products or that women who use home kit application Rao et al. Page 10

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptmight do so incorrectly (e.g., incorrect mixing of kit components, products left on the 
scalp longer than recommended, etc.), which might contribute to increased exposures to 
potentially harmful chemicals in the products used. Given our findings regarding duration of 
relaxer use and early use of relaxers, and building upon prior data, we hypothesize that the 
intensity of relaxer use might be the exposure needed to capture its effects on breast tumor 
clinicopathology and subsequently on breast cancer survival outcomes. This will require 
additional studies that are able to validly measure and characterize relaxer use exposures – 
frequency and intensity – and assess relationships among these exposures with long-term 
breast cancer prognosis.
As discussed in our earlier work ( 13), there are some limitations that should be considered in 
the interpretation of our findings. Recall bias (albeit non-differential in the current analysis 
of women with breast cancer) is of concern given that this study relied on participant’s 
ability to accurately remember and report their use of hair dyes and relaxers over a long 
span of time, which could be decades among older participants. Given that the current 
analysis included cases only, it is possible that non-differential exposure misclassification 
could have biased our risk estimates towards the null as we do not anticipate that participants 
would have reported hair product use differently based on having more or less aggressive 
tumor features. Menopausal status at the time of diagnosis is another factor we could have 
considered in our analysis. Due to potential nuances within single categories of hair products 
(e.g., permanent vs. semi-permanent hair dyes), we are uncertain of participants’ ability 
to accurately distinguish between types of hair products and we cannot speculate what 
affect this might have on the observed risk estimates. Additionally, changes in hair dye 
and/or chemical relaxer/straightening product formulations over time – which could not be 
assessed herein – and how these changes might have impacted the observed risk estimates 
is also a limitation. Another limitation was the relatively small sample size, particularly 
of White women, which reduced the precision of our estimates. Relatedly, low prevalence 
of relaxer use among White women ( 13) precluded exploration of some associations of 
interest. Nonetheless, our findings were generally consistent with regards to associations 
between longer duration of use, earlier use, and combination application of hair dyes and 
relaxers with increased odds of tumor features indicative of more aggressive phenotype. 
Despite these limitations, an important strength of this study was the large population-based 
design that included >2,000 Black women with breast cancer to assess the novel hypothesis 
that commonly used hair care products are associated with breast tumor clinicopathologic 
features. Collection of moderately detailed data on characteristics of hair product use and 
detailed information on confounding factors were additional strengths. Our findings also 
contribute to the generation of new hypotheses regarding potential impacts of hair dyes and 
relaxers on breast cancer outcomes, which warrants further study.
In summary, findings from this study provide preliminary data to support a relationship 
between characteristics of hair dye and relaxer use with breast tumor clinicopathology. 
These findings demonstrate that while crude ever vs. never measures of hair dye and 
relaxer use have linked these exposures with breast cancer risk, they may not adequately 
capture the granularity of hair product exposures needed to sufficiently assess the impacts 
of these exposures on breast cancer phenotypes and outcomes. Ideally, measures of 
chemical exposures assess dose, frequency, and duration. Applying a similar framework Rao et al. Page 11

understanding associations with breast cancer outcomes. Moreover, such measurement may

patterns to mitigate breast cancer risk and poorer outcomes in the future.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptHighlights
• This is the first study to examine the impact of characteristics of hair dye 
and relaxer use, including early use (before age 12), duration of use, typical 
application, and joint use of hair dyes and relaxers, on breast tumor features.
• Compared to salon only application, home kit and combination application 
(history of both home kit and salon application) of hair due were associated 
with 2-fold increased odds of poorly differentiated tumors, particularly among 
Black women.
• Compared to salon only application, combination application of relaxers was 
associated with 82% increased odds of larger tumors (>2.0 cm).
• Among women reporting relaxer use >10 years there was a significant 
positive trend for increasing tumor size.
• Joint use of hair dye and relaxer use was associated with more than 2-fold 
increased odds of positive lymph node status in ER− cases, which was not 
observed among ER+ cases.Rao et al. Page 16
