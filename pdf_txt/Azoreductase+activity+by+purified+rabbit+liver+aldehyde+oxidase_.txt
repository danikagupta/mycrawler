 4 Abstract:  
Many promising drug candidates metabolized by Aldehyde Oxidase (AOX) fail during the clinical 
trial due to underestimation of their clearance. AO X is species specific and this makes traditional 
allometric studies a poor choice for estimating human clearance. Other studies have suggested 
using half -life calculated b y measuring substrate depletion to measure the clearance. In this study, 
we are proposing using numerical fitting to  enzymatic pathways other t han Michaelis -Menten  
(MM)  to avoid missing the initial high turn -over rate of product formation . Here, product 
formation over 240 -minute time -course of s ix AOX substrates, O6-benzylguanine,  DACA, 
zaleplon , phthalazine, BIBX1382 and zoniporide have been provided to illustrate enzyme 
deactivation over time to help better understand why MM kinetics sometimes lead to 
underestimation of rate constants . Based on the data provided in this paper , the total velocity for 
substrates becomes slower than the initial velocity by 3.1, 6.5, 2.9, 32.2, 2.7 and 0.2 fold 
respectively  in human expressed pur ified enzyme (HAO) while the Km remains constant . Also, our 
studies on the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide 
shows that ROS did not significantly alter the change in enzyme activity over time. Providing a 
new electron acceptor, 5 -nitroquinoline, did however alter the change in rate over time for a 
number of compounds. The data also illustrate the difficulties in using substrate disappearance to 
estimate intrinsic clearance ( V/K).

 5 Introduction:  
Aldehyde oxi dase (AO X) is a cytosolic protein belonging to the family of molybdoflavoenzymes 
(Mendel, 2009) . It is found most extensively in liver but it is also expressed in kidney, lungs, the 
gastrointestinal tract and skin. AO X is a homodimer  enzyme that needs four cofactors in each one 
of its 150 kDa  subunits to be active. These cofactors including molybdenum pterin cofactor 
(MoCo), two iron -sulfu r clusters [2Fe -2S] and a f lavin adenine dinucleotide  (FAD) site (Garattini 
et al., 2008; Mendel, 2009) . The final electron acceptor for the flow of electrons from the MoCo 
site to the flavin site is molecular oxygen which  form s reactive oxygen species (ROS) O2•- and 
H2O2. AO X is capable of both oxidative and reductive transformation s of a wide range of 
compounds. AOX oxidative substrates include aldehydes, aromatic heterocycles , iminium ions  
and azaheterocycles . While AOX reductive substrates include sulfoxides, nitro compounds, N-
oxides , nitrates,  nitrites and molecular oxygen (Krenitsky et al., 1972; Kitamura and Tatsumi, 
1984; Stoddart and Levine, 1992; Li et al., 2009b; Pryde et al., 2010; Maia et al., 2015) . AO X 
reduction s have recently been gaining attention (Konishi et al., 2017; Paragas et al., 2017a; Amano 
et al., 2018) . Previously,  it was believed that AO X reduction only occurs under anaerobic 
conditions  (Li et al., 2009a; Weidert et al., 2014; Maia et al., 2015) . recently it was pro ved that 
reduction by AOX can also occur under normal oxygen condition and at a different site than where 
substrate oxidation happens . 
 
More than 90% of metabolic breakdown of drugs and x enobiotics is through  the P450 family  of 
enzymes (Lynch and Price, 2007) . However, recent ef forts toward making drugs more stable to 
P450 metabolism has also had the effect  of mak ing them susceptible to clearance by other 
pathways. This has turned the attention to studying other enzymatic pathways, particularly AO X, This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 6 in drug metabolism. Although extensive studies have been done on prediction of intrinsic clearance  
(CL int)  for P450 -cleared compounds (Dalvie et al ., 2010a) , the ability to obtain a close estimation 
of in vivo clearance from in vitro  data for AO X-mediated metabolism has not yet been developed . 
Traditional allometric scaling assumes that drug elimination mechanism is conserved across 
species but this is not the case for AO X since there is a noticeable difference in AO X activity 
between  human and preclinical species. In species, such as rat and mouse, substrate is metabolized 
by different isoenzymes, AOX1 and AOX3, while it is not metabolized at all by AO X in dogs , 
which do not produce active AO  (Kaye et al., 1984; Dalvie et al., 2010b; Garattini and Terao, 
2012) . Recent  efforts to predict clearance  have used  novel allometric studies using single -species 
scaling (SSS) or multispecies allometry (MA) to scale in vitro CL int, rat, guinea pig, monkey and 
minipig to human in vitro CL int (Crouch et al., 2018) . Another method proposed to predict in vivo 
metab olism from in vitro CL int is by monitoring substrate depletion in time and then use the half -
life to scale up the results to the whole human body (Zientek et al., 2010) . 
 
Atypical kinetics of cytochrome P450 family of enzymes has already been extensively studied  
(Korzekwa et al., 1998; Hutzler and Tracy, 2002) . However, this  kind of behavior is not specific  
to that family. Many AO substrates deviate from Michaelis -Menten  (MM)  steady state kinetics. 
The enzyme is nonlinear over time and it is apparent that multiple substrate can bind to the enzyme 
resulting in substrate inhibition (Barr et al., 2014) . MM kinetics  requires  a single  active  site per 
enzyme and it also requires each site to operate independent ly from others  in a homodimeric 
protein .

 7 In this paper, we have used three  enzyme systems, human liver S9 fraction , human liver cytosol 
(HLC) and purified expressed human AO X (HAO) to monitor product formation over a  240-
minute time course for s ix substrates . We evaluate whether product is formed at a constant rate 
over the time course, which we define as a linear time course, or if the enzyme changes rate over 
time (nonlinear).  Furthermore , since oxygen plays an important role in the enzyme cycle  as the 
ultimate electron acceptor (Pryde et al., 2010) , we check for any loss of a ctivity related to oxygen 
consumption or reduction during the catalytic cycle by using superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 
catalase to remove ROS  and determine the affinity of oxygen for human AO . This article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.DMD Fast Forward.

 8 Materials and methods:  
N-(2-dimethylamino)ethyl)acridine -4-carboxamide ( DACA ) was synthesized as described 
previously  (Paragas et al., 2017b) . O6-benzylguanine (O 6BG) and zaleplon , were purchased from 
Toronto Research Chemicals (ON, Canada), zoniporide  and dantrolene  from Cayman Chemical 
Company (Ann Arbor, MI), BIBX 1382  from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK), and internal 
standards (phenacetin and 2-methly -4(3H)-quinazolinone), phth alazine, protocatechuic ac id, 
protocatechuate 3,4 -dioxygenase ( Pseudomonas sp .), glucose oxidase ( Aspergillus sp. ), glu cose, 
catalase  (bovine liver),  and superoxide dismutase (SOD, bovine erythrocytes) were purchased 
from Sigma -Aldrich  (St. Lou is, MO). The standard metabolites were synthesized and purified as 
previously described (Paragas et al., 2017b)  except 1 -phthalazinone which was purchased from 
Sigma -Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 5 -nitroquinoline was purchased from TCI America (Portland , 
OR). The monobasic potassium phosphate, dibasic potassiu m phosphate and 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) used for the potassium phosphate buffer were purchased 
from JT Baker (Center Valley, PA). Human liver S9 fraction, pooled from 20 donors (gender ratio 
not specified, lot # 3212595), was purchaced from BD Gentest (Corning, NY).  Human liver 
cytosol (HLC), pooled from 50 individual donors (30 male and 20 female , lot # 1410012 ), was 
purchased from XenoTech (Lenexa, KS). Expression and purification of human AOX ( HAO ) was 
performed following the method previously described (Alfaro et al., 2009; Paragas et al., 2017b) . 
The total amount of AOX in HLC and HAO was quantified by liquid chromatography -tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS)  (Barr et al.,  2013) . 
 
General incubation conditions.  Each incubation vial contained 5 times the Km amount of each 
substrate in 25  mM potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM EDTA. Samples were This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 9 pre-incubated for 5 minutes at 37 °C.  The reaction was started by adding the HLC (0.0051 µM 
final AO concentration ) or HAO ( 0.0192 -0.043 µM). Total reaction volume was 3 ml and 200 µL 
of the reaction vial was taken out and quenched immediately at times 0, 2, 4, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 
120, 240 minutes. The time points fo r phthalazine were slightly different, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 
4, 5, 10, 20, 45, 75, 135, 240 minutes, due to its immediate transition to nonlinearity. Samples 
were quenched using 50 µL of 1 M formic acid containing known concentration of IS  (either 
phenacetin or 2 -methly -4(3H)-quinazolinone) . Incubation with the human liver S9 fraction (20 
mg/ml) was only done for the substrate O6BG  as an example to check the results in a more intact 
cellular fraction . The samples were then centrifuged at 16 ,100g for 10 minutes  in an Eppendorf 
centrifuge 5415D and the supernatant was collected for LC -MS/MS. For experiments done to 
check the effect of ROS, the incubation conditions were similar except 250 U/mL catalase and 250 
U/mL of SOD were added to the reaction  before pre -incubation. Same for reactions in which 5NQ 
was used. Five times the Km amount of 5NQ (200 µM) in the presence of oxygen was added to the 
reaction before the pre -incubation . All the experiments were done in triplicates and the goodness 
of fits were assessed using the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) value s. 
 
Oxygen K m calculation. The Km for oxygen was measured using saturating concentration of 
phathalazine . HLC was incubated with protocatechuate 3,4 -dioxygenase (1 U/mL) and 
protocathechuic acid (20 mM) . The oxygen concentration was monitored using Robust oxygen 
probe (Pyroscience, Germany). Aliquots were collected when the needed oxygen concentration 
was re ached and added to a vial containing 50 mM phthalazine. The phthalazine assay was 
incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 minutes. The final reaction volume was 100 µL. The reaction was This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 10 quenched by the addition of 25 µL of 1 M formic acid containing 25 µM phenacetin, as  internal 
standard.  
 
Data analysis. Numerical fitting in Mathematica 11.0.1.0 (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL) 
was performed using the NDSolve function with MaxSteps → 10000 and PrecisionGoal → ¥ . k1 
was fixed to 270 µM s-1 and k 2 was set to k 1´ Km for each substrate. Model fitting was done using 
the NonlinearModelFit function with 1/Y weighting. G oodness of fit was evaluated by AIC and 
RSquared commands. Dataset simulation was done using the rate constants derived from the 
numerical fitting.  GraphP ad Prism 7.0c (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for 
developing saturation curves . The data was fitted to three different kinetic models; namely, 
Michaelis -Menten (MM), dead model and the modulated activity model (MAM) (Fig. 4)  the 
graphical results of the fits are given for all substrates in supplemental information  (supplemental 
Fig. 1) . Several s ubstrate inhibition model s were also developed (Supplemental Fig. 2). These 
model s were tested on two of our substrates which were r eported to exhibit substrate inhibition, 
DACA and phthalazine , (Obach et al. , 2004; Paragas et al., 2017b) . The fit s to these model s were 
either  almost identical to the MAM or could not fit the data points well (Supplemental Fig. 3 and 
Supplemental Table 1).  
Liquid Chromatography – Mass Spectrometry. Samples were analyzed using an LC -20AD 
series high performance liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) fitted with an 
HTC PAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies, Carrboro, NC). Chromatography was performed 
using two columns, a L una C18 column (50 ´ 2.0 m m, 5 µm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and a 
Luna C18 column (100 ´ 2.0 mm, 5 µm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Mobile phase A consisted 
of 0.05% (by volume) formic acid and 0.2% acetic acid (MilliporeSigma, Billerica, MA) in water, This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 11 and mobile phase B comprised 90% acetonitrile (MilliporeSigma, Billerica, MA), 9.9% water, and 
0.1% formic acid ( Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) . The quantitation was conducted on an API 
4000 Q -Trap mass spectrometry system (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Foster City, CA) with 
turbospray ESI operating in positive ion mode. For O6BG and 8 -oxo-O6BG, the initial condition 
was 10% mobile phase B and 90% mobile phase A for 0.3 minutes. The concentration of mobile 
phase B was ramped  up to 95% at 2.2 minutes and held constant for 0.1 minutes , followed by a 
linear gradient back to 10% B for 0.9 min.  For DACA, zaleplon, zoniporide and BIBX 1382  
together with their respective metabolites, the initial condition was 10% mobile phase B and 90% 
mobile phase A  until 0.3 minutes . The concentration of mobile phase B was ramped  up to 75% at 
2.2 minutes and held constant for 0.1 minutes before ramping down to 10% again at 3.1 minutes 
and held constant for 0.9 minutes. For zaleplon the initial cond ition until 0.3 minutes was 10% 
mobile phase B and 90% mobile phase A. The concentration of mobile phase B then ramps up to 
95% at 2.2 minutes and held constant for 0.1 minutes before ramping down to 10% again at 3.1 
minutes and held constant for 0.9 minut es. For phthalazine the initial condition until 2 minutes 
was 10% mobile phase B and 90% mobile phase A. The concentration of mobile phase B then 
ramps up to 80% at 8 minutes and held constant for 0.5 minutes before ramping down to 10% 
again at 9 minutes a nd held constant for 1 minute. The mass spectrometer tuning parameters used 
for all the compounds were as follows: collision gas, medium; curtain gas, 20; ion spray voltage 
4900; ion source gas 1, 35; ion source gas 2, 55; desolvation temperature 600; decl ustering 
potential, 70; entrance potential, 10; cell exit potential, 15; and the collision energy was 25 for 
O6BG, DACA, zaleplon and zoniporide. The only differing factor for BIBX and Phthalazine was 
the collision energy which were 65 and 35 respectively.  The flow rate for O6BG, DACA, 
zoniporide and BIBX (including their respective metabolites) was 0.4 mL/min. The flowrate for This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 13 Results:  
Time course  
The data indicates that AOX  cataly sis rates are not constant over time and in most case s the enzyme 
appears to be less active as time progresses depending on the substrate. For example, in the case 
of phthalazine the linear range of enzymatic activity is very short ( less than 3  minutes) and in other 
instances such as zoniporide the enzymatic activity remains almost linear and may even  increase 
slightly over 240 -min incubation time  (Fig. 2).  It should be noted that we do not have metabolic 
standards for BIBX 1382  and zoniporide  so the rate constants are not accurate.  These compounds 
are included since they support that most reactions are nonlinear over time.  For these compounds 
we report peak area ratio (PAR) instead of  µmoles/min.  
 
A source of purified enzyme was used to con firm that the data from HLC is mainly the result of 
AOX activity and no other enzyme sources in liver cytosol. From comparing the plots for both 
enzyme sources, it is evident that the linearity of both sets are very similar and this suggests that 
the nonli nearity in time is the result of change in the activity of AO X (Fig. 3). The results from 
incubation of O6BG with S9 fraction shows that the same mechanism persists even in a more intact 
cell system (Supplementa l Fig. 4). 
 
Data fitting using Mathematica  
The assumption for MM kinetics is that the enzyme produces product in a linear fashion over time.  
This is obviously not the case, and we could not get a good fit for this model to our results. For the 
dead model the differential equation s are solved based  on the kinetic scheme that suggests an 
irreversible loss of enzymatic activity over time. Finally , we tested a model in which it is assumed  This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 14 that the enzyme is altered over time to have a slower rate of reaction and therefore runs with a 
lower efficiency after a certain period of time.  This last model could be a result of a number of 
changes in the enzyme, such as a slow conformational change, or chemical modification, such as 
oxidation of amino acids by ROS.    
 
 Although in many cases the MM model gives a visually acceptable fit, the AIC values predict  that 
the MAM, in which the enzyme activity is altered over time, is the kinetic model that describes 
the enzymatic behavior best with zoniporide being the only exce ption. The importance of using 
the right model can be fur ther emphasized by seeing up to almost 40 -fold difference between the  
rate constants related to each model in HAO or  HLC (Tables 1 and 2). The differences between 
these rate constants are substrate s pecific, thus scaling is not an option and one must use the correct 
model to get a correct intrinsic clearance. Based on the assumption that the fast initial rate (k 3) is 
what happens in the in vivo situation, we can use the  intrinsic clearance  (V/K) and then use 
equation 1 to scale up the calculations to clearance per body weight. In addition, we have also done  
the calculations with k 5 instead of k 3 to present how m issing the fast initial rate due to experimental 
errors in choosing the linear portion  of the time -course plot may lead to underestimation of 
clearance by using the apparent k 3 which will be similar to k 5.

The amount of AOX in the liver in  the formula above  was previously calculated in our lab to be

 15 model and the in vivo data (Table 3). The data shows a significant improvement of in vitro 
clearance for the MAM. This difference becomes increasingly noticeable with longer  incubation 
times. Unfortunately, the number of the substrates that we were able to calculate the intrinsic 
clearance for are few. However, the MAM data shows a great improvement for all three substrates  
in comparison wit h what was previously reported in the literature (Zientek et al., 2010)  
 
Some potential r easons behind nonlinearity in enzyme activity  
A number of mechanisms could be responsible for this loss of activity. First, we hypothesized that 
the loss of activity was a result of the enzyme inactivation by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
super oxide and hydrogen pe roxide which is generated during the catalytic cycle. To test this 
theory, we used superoxide dismutase and catalase. Catalase was used to remove hydrogen 
peroxide  and s uperoxide is removed by SOD . By using these two enzyme sources we expected to 
see an in crease in the linearity of enzyme activity. No significant change in enzyme linearity was 
observed in either HLC or HAO. However, some inconsistencies were observed between HLC and 
HAO activities with or without using SOD and catalase. In the case of HLC a ll substrates showed 
some to very little improvement in activity except O6BG but in the case of HAO almost the 
opposite trend was observed. Unlike what happened in HLC, the activity decreased with adding 
oxygen species scavengers for DACA and zoniporide wh ile it increased for O6BG. In the case of 
zaleplon and BIBX there was little to no improvement in activity the same as what was observed 
in HLC ( Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). What was consistent was that in any case no improvement in linearity 
of the time -course plo ts was observed. Given  these results  it is not likely  that ROS are not the main

Substrate depletion over time  
Another potential reason for the nonlinearity is a substantial decrease in the oxidative substrate 
concentration. The amount of substrate disappearance as calculated by the amount of product 
form ed indicates that the amount of substrate consumed was less than 10% of the total substrate 
in most cases. We have simulated substrate disappe arance to demonstrate this ( Fig. 7) assuming 
1M of product is formed from 1M of substrate. This should be the same e ven for the substrates 
that we don’t have the standards for since we have used five times the Km amount for all the 
substrates. This indicates that substrate depletion is not significant  for the oxidative substrates. 
However, the reductive substrate oxygen  could also be significantly depleted.  In our laboratory, 
and under the conditions of our reaction, the oxygen concentration is very close to 213 µM.  Since 
one to two oxygen  molecules  are consumed per catalytic cycle it appears that only a small fraction 
of the substrate oxygen is consumed.   However , one might still se e nonlinearity over time if the 
Km value for oxygen is ver y high.  We measured the Km value to be around 2 µM for human AOX . 
To double -check our results, we have used the data published earlier for a reductive substrate of 
AOX,  dantrolene  (Amano et al., 2018) . Since d antrolene gets reduced by AOX  to aminodentrolene 
by a three step process similar to 5NQ (Paragas et al., 2017a)  , it will compete for the reduction 
site of the enzyme with oxygen. W e have  used the K mapp reported in the paper mentioned above  
for d antrolene  (65 µM) and the  Km of this substra te was also measured in our lab under anaerobic 
condition  (4.7 µM, unpublished data , manuscript in preparation ). This enabled us to  calculate the 
Ki for oxygen  to be approximately 15.6 µM by using the equation K mapp= K m (1+ [I]/K i) assuming 
that the oxygen  concentration, [I],  is close to 213 µM when the atmospheric pressure ranges from  
765-780 mm Hg at 37°C (Weiss, 1970) . Since either way, the oxygen K m is much smaller than its This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 17 concentration present during the reaction, depletion of the substrate oxygen is not a factor in the 
nonlinearity.   
 
Using 5NQ as a reductive substrate  
A third hypothesis is  that maybe the enzyme is slow to reduce oxygen, and that the fast rate is an 
initial rate prior to the complete reduction of the enzyme . This problem should be more evident in 
the case of substrates with high turn -over rate  and to some extent this is what we observe . To test 
this hypothesis , we used 5NQ as a reducing substrate to substitute for oxygen in the enzyme  cycle . 
Since 5NQ reduction is a 6 -electron reduction we would observe a change in the enzyme activity 
if electron transfer has become rate -limiting  once we substitute  this substrate for molecular oxygen 
which only needs 2 electrons to be reduced . 5NQ is red uced by AOX to 5 -aminoquinoline.  Unlike 
its isomer,  6-nitroquinoline , 5NQ can  be both oxidized and reduced by  AOX under normal oxygen 
condition (Rajapakse et al., 2013) . Time-course results indicate that we do see a change in activity 
with alternate reducing substrate as one would expect if electrons are transferred more slowly (Fig. 
8). This is consistent with our previous results showing that once an oxidative substrate is present, 
5NQ has an increased affinity for the  flavin site where it can compete with oxygen  (Paragas et al., 
2017a) . This can lead to a disruption in enzyme oxidation  and may be the reason for the observed 
loss in enzyme activity.  While this is consistent with the data, the complicated kinetics means that 
a number of possibilities are likely since a few factors can affect electron flow through the enzyme.  This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 18 Discussion:  
After monitoring the changes in AOX  activity over time  in both HAO and HLC  for six oxidative 
substrates . We found  that the enzyme does not behave linearly over time  for most substrates .   We 
used three different kinetic models to determine what  was likely happening kinetically over time. 
Initially we assumed that the enzyme loses its activity completely  over tim e, in other words it dies.   
This leads to better fits than the MM model, but still does not describe the data very well . The next 
hypothesis was that the enzyme is altered over time and therefore runs with a lower efficiency after 
a certain period of time , this gave the best fits for all of the substrates except zoniporide .  
Representative  fits to each model , for the substrate O6BG , are shown in Fig. 4 and for all substrate 
in supplemental information .   
 
Next, we checked for possible reasons behind loss of activity in AOX. Although it has been 
mentioned before that superoxide has little effect on biological molecules and enzymes, there have 
been instances like cytochrome c where it does compromise enzyme a ctivity often by oxidation of 
thiols  (Searle and Willson, 1980; Kundu et al., 2007) . To check if ROS altered enzyme activity,  
we decided to also check the ef fect by removing them with SOD and catalase. Based on the results , 
no significant change in enzyme linearity was observed with or without using ROS  scavengers 
showing that ROS are not altering  enzymatic behavior.  
 
Subst antial decrease in substrate concentration can also lead to similar changes in  enzyme linearity 
but this hypothesis was rejected by determining the amount of oxidative substrate depletion .  
Simul ation results for the  substrates show that most of the substrates are not  extensively consumed 
from  their initial concentration  and since  the initial concentrations was  five times the Km this This article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.DMD Fast Forward.

 19 should not lead to nonlinear kinetics  (Fig. 7).  As for the reductive substrate of AOX, O 2, (Garattini 
et al., 2003; Pryde et al., 2010)   we have determined that its Km is approximately  2-16 µM  and 
based on the atmospheric pressure  where the experiment was done, the concentration of oxygen is 
around 2 13 µM. We know that among the substrates that we used, even the substrate with the 
fastest turn -over rate would only consume between 20 -40 µmoles  of oxygen leaving the 
concentration in  the reaction vial  more than 5 times the K m and the reaction would be zero order 
with respect to oxygen  
 
To regenerate AOX after oxidation  of substrate  we need to transfer electrons from the Moco 
through the iron-sulfur clusters to the FAD before we reduce  oxygen.  If this electron transfer path 
is slow, reduced AOX  will build -up and reduction  of oxygen  will become the rate -limiting step . 
This is consistent with the fact that a kinetic isotope effect was observed  upon substrate oxidation  
on V/K but not V max (Alfaro et al., 2009).   This hypothesis  is also consistent  with our time-course 
plots where the fast initial rate decreases as more and more enzyme s get trapped in their reduced 
state.  To test this hypothesis w e used 5NQ as a source of reductive substrate  that will compete 
with oxygen in accepting electrons from AOX  to check whether a disruption  of electron transfer  
is the reason behind the loss in enzyme activity. Since 5NQ needs 6 electrons to get reduced to 5 -
aminoquinoline  (Paragas et al., 2017a) ,  this should change the rat e of the second kinetic phase 
after the enzyme becomes reduced.  The data i n Fig. 8 is consistent with  the slowing of electron  
transfer and  a change in the rate-limiting step from oxidation to reduction.  However,  one caveat 
with this conclusion is that the rates for the slow reaction (k 5) for all the substrates  should be the 
same,  since  the rate limiting step on the second kinetic phase of the reaction is the oxidation of 
enzyme by O 2 and should be substrate  independent.  However, looking at the k 5 values for the This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 20 substrates we can see up to a 3 -fold difference. In addition to that, if this was the case, we would 
also expect similar looking plots for substrates that exhibit similar k 3 values such as DACA and 
O6BG.  But looking at the plots, we can se e O6BG time -course plot looks much more linear than 
DACA. This can be explained if we  consider the effect of substrate inhibition.  It appears that 
O6BG does not show any substrate inhibition (Barr et al., 2015)  while the reported K I value for 
DACA was 91 µM (Paragas et al., 2017b) . We hypothesize  that the second substrate molecule 
would bind to the reduction site and therefore mak e the reduction happen even more slowly,  the 
same effect that we saw by using a reductive substrate  5NQ , and that is why the k 5 value for DACA 
is lower than that of O6BG. It is also worth mentioning that phthalazine also exhibits substrate 
inhibition and the reported value of K I for this substrate is 250 µM (Obach et al., 2004) .  However 
since  DACA is a more effective inhibitor of electron transfer to oxygen  compared with pthalazin e, 
DACA has a slower rate in the second kinetic phase .  Attempts to fit substrate inhibition did not 
improve the overall fit,  as might be expected, given that the model already can fit each single 
substrate dataset very well.  The fits are given in supplemental Figure 2 for O -6BG .   
 
In this work, the in trinsic clearance values were also compared using the rate constants derived 
from the MAM and MM models . The results show a significant improvement of clearance 
estimation for MAM.  Given that the initial rate calculations only account for how the enzyme 
behave s for a very short period of time , longer incubation times are needed  for a more 
comprehensive assessment of the enzyme kinetics. U sing the MM model leads to  a considerable 
underprediction of intrinsic clearance in vitro due to negligence towards the fast initial turn -over 
rate. One assumption behind the residual underprediction using MAM can be refer red back to the 
involvement of extrahepatic clearance. This factor has also been considered for in silico estimation This article has not been copyedited and formatted.

 21 of  intrinsic clearance by AO (Jones and Korzekwa, 2013)  and the in vivo -in vitro correlation plot 
is consistant with this assumption (Supplemental Fig. 5). We admit tha t we cannot be certain this 
is the case, although the know n underestimation of V/K supports this conclusion.  Futherm ore the 
rate of reaction, to some extent , can be predicted by the reactivity of the substrate  that is oxidized, 
while if the second phase is oxidation of the enzyme no such correlation would be expected to 
exist  (Zhang et al., 2018)    
 
Overall, the main goal of this paper is to show that almost all AOX catalyzed reactions are 
nonlinear over time, and that ignoring this leads to an underestimation of clearance . We have 
shown that there can be up to 40 -fold under -prediction of the reaction rate by simply assuming 
linear kinetics.  We believe that the constant under -prediction of drug clearance by AOX  is due to 
the rapid slowing of the reaction rate once the reaction is started a nd that even short incubations 
would not lead to a n accurate determination of the k cat. In this  paper, we are using numerical fitting 
to get the closest approximation of the real initial rate value by fitting the metabolite formation 
over 4 -hour period  instead of only using  the short “linear” region of the plot . MAM  seems to do 
well in describing the enzymatic pathway in whic h the enzyme’s life is divided into two stages. 
The first one being a fully active enzyme and the second being the stage where the enzyme forms 
metabolite at a slower rate.
