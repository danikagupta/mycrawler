Abstract:
In this work, degradation of stripped sourwater by Fenton´s oxidation process was investigated by a central composite design and
response surface methodology. e eﬀects of initial concentrations of H 2O2 and Fe2+ on the total phenols degradation was studied
in a batch reactor. e optimum total phenols degradation was 92% achieved within an H 2O2 concentration of 4.4 g L-1 and
iron concentration of 162 mg L-1. e mathematical kinetic model adequately represented the experimental results. e results
indicated that the Fenton oxidation rate (1/m) and removal eﬃciency (1/b) were more dependent on iron concentration than
H2O2 concentration. Aer the Fenton process, the sourwater presented a seed germination rate ( L. sativa ) above 80%, indicating
reduced phytotoxicity of the treated eﬄuent. It was also observed that the H 2O2 concentration signiﬁcantly aﬀected the inhibition
concentration (IC 50).
Keywords: petroleum eﬄuent, advanced oxidative process, total phenols, bioassays, experimental design.
Introduction
Petroleum reﬁnery uses a huge amount of water in its processes, consequently, a signiﬁcant volume of
wastewater is generated and depends on several factors such as the type and setting of its process and the
characteristics of the processed oil ( Yavuz, Koparal, & Ö#ütveren, 2010 ; El-Naas, Alhaija, & Al-Zuhair,
2014 ) . In general, the chemical composition of petroleum reﬁnery eﬄuent presents several inorganic
substances, emulsiﬁed oil, phenols, sulﬁdes, ammonia and cyanides ( Yan, Ma, Wang, Mao, & Chen, 2010 ) .
Due to the toxicity and the harmful eﬀects on human health and environment, it is necessary to develop
eﬃcient and economically feasible methods to remove these pollutants from petroleum reﬁnery eﬄuents and

to monitor its toxicity. In this context, bioassay tests can be used as a complementary response for treated
wastewater to determine its toxicity.
Due to the global concern about water scarcity, new methods for reusing water in petroleum reﬁneries
are required. According to Coelho, Castro, Dezotti, and Santanna (2006 ) , a stream of sourwater can be
segregated and treated for possible reuse. is wastewater is generated from the condensation of the steam
that is used in the distillation, catalytic cracking, and other applications. e sourwater production in
reﬁneries is comprised of about 0.2 m3ton-1 and 0.5 m3ton-1 of crude oil processed ( Coelho et al., 2006 ) .
is eﬄuent is the stream which contains hydrocarbons, which in turn contain hydrogen sulphide (H 2S)
and ammonia (NH 3). ese compounds are absorbed into the water at levels that typically require stripper
treatment ( International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association [Ipieca], 2010 ) .
However, the stripped sourwater still contains phenols and cyanide.
Conventional treatments of reﬁnery wastewater are based on primary and biological treatments in
the integrated activated sludge treatment unit. However, these methods are not suitable to remove
non-biodegradable and high-concentration organic substances. us, advanced techniques for removing
these substances from petroleum reﬁnery wastewater must be developed ( Sun, Zhang, & Quan, 2008 ) .
According to Hasan, Aziz, and Daud (2012)  , an advanced oxidation process (AOP) has been proposed
to treat petroleum reﬁnery eﬄuents (PRE), including photocatalytic degradation, ozonation, and photo-
degradation. ere are several studies on pre-treatment, but studies on sourwater treatment are still scarce.
Some patents have been proposed, dealing with oxidation by Fenton process ( Solvay Interox Inc., 2001 ) and
membrane process ( Hydrometric, 2002 ) . Coelho et al. (2006)  studied sourwater treatment using several
AOPs and concluded that Fenton and photo-Fenton processes show the best performance in removing
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from sourwater (55 and 83%, respectively).
e Fenton process entails hydrogen peroxide catalysis by the ferrous ion to produce hydroxyl radical
(HO●) and involves numerous reactions ( Wu, Zhou, Qin, Zheng, & Ye, 2010 ; Brink, Sheridan, & Harding,
2017  ). Its eﬃciency depends on several variables: pH, temperature, H 2O2 and Fe2+ concentrations.
Bioassays provide a biological response (germination, root elongation, and others) and these data
complement the chemical data (total phenols concentration, COD, TOC, and others) to assess  in vivo
toxicity of the treated eﬄuent. e plant-based bioassays have advantages of low-cost test and easy handle
and measure ( Sobrero & Ronco, 2004 ; Garcia et al., 2009 ) . Lactuca sativa  is widely used for germination,
and the growth inhibition of the root is used as evaluation endpoints of phytotoxic eﬀects ( International
Organization for Standardization [ISO], 1995 ; United States Environmental Protection Agency [EPA],
1996 ; Organização para a Cooperação e Desenvolvimento Econômico [OECD], 2003 ) .
e aim of this work was to investigate the kinetics of sourwater degradation by Fenton process. A 22
factorial design of experiments was proposed to study the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide and
Fe2+ and maximize the degradation of stripped sourwater total phenols. A mathematical kinetic model was
also derived to predict the reaction kinetics. Based on the lettuce seeds ( Lactuca sativa ), the toxicity of non-
treated and treated eﬄuent was estimated.
Material and methods
Experimental
A sample of stripped sourwater was obtained from Getúlio Vargas Reﬁnery (Petrobrás) located in Araucaria,
Paraná State, Brazil. e sample was collected, stored under refrigeration (4 oC) and used without any pre-
treatment at room temperature (22 ± 2ºC). e hydrogen peroxide (30%, v v-1), H 2SO 4 and NaOH wereThiago Atsushi Takashina, et al. Sourwater treatment by fenton process and its effect on phytotoxi...

purchased from Merck. e Na 2CO 3 and phenol were acquired from Vetec, the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent
from Sigma-Aldrich, and the FeSO 4.7H 2O from Dinâmica.
Experimental arrangement
Chemical oxidation was performed in a batch reactor (600 mL capacity) containing 500 mL of stripped
sourwater. e reactor operated under constant stirring, accomplished by a magnetic bar. e reaction
temperature was maintained at 22 ± 1ºC. Reagents employed in the oxidation process were FeSO 4.7H 2O and
H2O2. e pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to the desired value 3.0 ± 0.1 using solution of H 2SO 4.
e catalyst (iron sulfate) was introduced aer the pH adjustment to avoid iron precipitation. Time zero of
the run was set as the moment when the hydrogen peroxide solution was added. e Fenton reaction was
stopped by adding a solution of NaOH to reach the pH of above 7.0. A pH-meter from ermo Scientiﬁc
was used for measuring the solution pH.
Analytical techniques
Total phenols concentration was determined by using Folin-Ciocalteau  reagent according to the protocol
described by Scalbert, Monties, and Janin (1989)  , and it was expressed as mg L-1 of phenol (C 6H5OH). e
percentage of total phenols degradation was obtained using  Equation 1 :
(1)
where:
CTP,0 and C TP are the initial and time t of total phenols concentration, respectively.
Factorial design
e independent factors (variables) considered in this work were H 2O2 (Pe) and Fe2+ (Fe) concentrations
in g L-1 and mg L-1, respectively, whereas percentage total phenols degradation (y 1) was considered as the
response (dependent factor). Room temperature of 22 ± 2ºC and initial pH of 3 ± 0.1 were kept constant
to avoid the inﬂuence of additional factors. Table 1  shows the independent variable and Central Composite
Design (CCD) levels used in this work. e ranges of selected parameters were determined based on Coelho
et al. (2006) . e [H 2O2] varied from 1.6 to 4.4 g L-1 and [Fe2+] from 59 to 162 mg L-1.
Based on the CCD principle, the design consisted of 2k factorial points plus 2*k axial points and 3 center
points, where k is the number of variables (in this case, k = 2). us, 11 experiments were conducted: four
(22) factorial points, four (2*2) axial points, and 3 central points to estimate the experimental error; three
replications were used. CCD in RSM (response surface methodology) was used to illustrate the output
nature of the response surface in the designed experiment and to explain the optimization level of the two
independent variables.Acta Scientiarum, 2019, vol. 41, January-December, ISSN: 1806-2563 1807-8664

Kinetic models for total phenols degradation
e kinetics of process can be quite complex due to a signiﬁcant number of steps performed simultaneously
during the process ( Behnajady, Modirshahla, & Ghanbary, 2007 ) . ree kinetic models, the pseudo ﬁrst-
order, the pseudo second-order and the mathematical kinetic model, were used on the experimental data
points obtained from total phenols degradation.
e rate of total phenols (TP) degradation regarding ﬁrst-order rate can be described by the Equation 2 .
(2)
where:
CTP,0 and C TP are the total phenols concentration (mg L-1) in the initial and time t, respectively, k 1 is the
apparent ﬁrst order rate constant (min.-1), and t is the reaction time (min.).
e rate of total phenols (r TP) described by second-order reaction kinetics is given by Equation 3  (Guedes,
Madeira, Boaventura, & Costa, 2003 ; Sun et al., 2009 ) :
(3)
where:
k2 is the s order kinetic parameter (L mg-1min.-1).
A mathematical kinetic model to simulate the reaction kinetics were derived by Chan and Chu (2003)
and Behnajady et al. (2007)  and are presented in the Equation 4 .
(4)
where:
m and b are constants relating the reaction kinetics and oxidation capacity. e terms m and b (Equation
5) can be determined by taking the derivation of Equation 4 .
(5)
where:
t is very short or approaching zero, Equation 5  can be written according to Equation 6 .

e corresponding physical meanings of m and b parameters were investigated by examining two extreme
cases. e higher 1/ m value, the faster initial degradation rate of total phenols. When t is long and approaches
to inﬁnity, the 1/ b value indicates the maximum total phenols degradation fraction, which is equal to the
maximum oxidation capacity of the Fenton process at the end of the reaction, according Equation 7 .

TABLE 1.
Factor levels for central composite design (CCD) in the Fenton process.
e parameters of kinetic models for total phenols degradation at diﬀerent Fenton´s reagent
concentration were calculated by applying non-linear regression to (C TP/C TP,0) versus t for the ﬁrst-order
model and mathematical model and linear regression analysis to (1/ CTP) – (1/ CTP,0 ) versus t for the second-
order model.
Toxicity test with Lactuca sativa L.
e lettuce seeds ( Lactuca sativa L .) were used to assess the non-treated and treated stripped sourwater
toxicological response. e lettuce seeds were used as toxicity level bioindicators due to their fast response
to concentrated and diluted by-product solutions. Bioassays in lettuce seed were conducted for germination
index, the length of the radicle and length of hypocotyl structure, following the methodology proposed
by Sobrero and Ronco (2004)  . Five dilutions were tested (6, 12, 25, 50 and 100%) of non-treated and
treated stripped sourwater solutions. e test was carried out in 90 mm diameter Petri dishes lined ﬁlter
paper with 10 seeds each, containing 2 mL of sample dilution or control water. e plates were covered and
placed in a plastic bag to prevent moisture loss and incubated for 120 hours at 22 ± 2ºC. Each assay was
done in triplicate. e lettuce seeds containing mineral water was used as negative control ( United States
Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], 1989 ; Sobrero & Ronco, 2004 ) . e absolute germination (AG)
and germination index (GI) for bioassays, were calculated according to Equation 8  and 9.

Ngerm is the average number of germinated seeds to indicate that the dilution was being performed with
treated stripped sourwater; N seed is the total number of seeds, and Ncont is the average number of germinated
control seeds in mineral water. RL germ is the average root length of germinated seed in the diluted treated
stripped sourwater, and RL cont is the average root length of germinated seed in control. e half inhibition
growth concentration (IC 50) was calculated by germination index (GI) using Probit method in Statistica®
7.0. Means values of IC 50 were compared among the treatments by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the
Tukey test at the signiﬁcance level (p < 0.05).
Results and discussion
Table 2  presents the characteristics of the sourwater employed in the oxidation experiments and data found
in the literature.
e characteristics of stripped sourwater show the recalcitrant nature of the organic compounds (263 mg
L-1 total phenols) and an advanced oxidation process, such as Fenton´s reagent, seems to be a suitable option
to treat this eﬄuent.
e performance and optimization of Fenton treatment were investigated applying a CCD full factorial
design with two factors: hydrogen peroxide concentration [H 2O2] and iron concentration [Fe]. Table 3
shows the results of the Fenton experiments as the average of percentual of total phenols degradation aer
15 min. of reaction (experimental response).
Based on the experimental results, an empirical equation on Fenton process of stripped sourwater was
written in a coded term for the percentage of total phenols degradation ( Equation 10 ). All model terms were
analyzed by a t-test, and the term found to be insigniﬁcant (p > 0.05) was excluded from the model. e
initial iron concentration was the most signiﬁcant factor in the Fenton process of sourwater that decomposes
H2O2 to generate ●OH followed by hydrogen peroxide concentration (Pe). e square interaction (Pe*Pe
and Fe*Fe) and interaction terms (Pe*Fe) were not statistically signiﬁcant (p > 0.05) upon total phenols
degradation of stripped sourwater by Fenton oxidation. All linear terms showed positive eﬀects.
(10)
e ANOVA analysis indicated that F-values of 91.54 implies that the proposed model was signiﬁcant
for total phenols and the ‘lack of ﬁt’ p-value for total phenols was not signiﬁcant (p = 0.204). e R2 for
empirical equation was 0.87 indicating the reliability to estimate total phenols.
e mathematical model ( Equation 10 ) was used to generate 2D and 3D plots ( Figure 1 ) demonstrating
the interaction between initial iron and hydrogen peroxide concentration.
Figure 1  shows an increase of TP degradation with increasing iron concentration. e fact that higher
degradation of total phenols was achieved at high Fe2+ dosages was attributed to the higher production of
●OH in Fenton´s reaction.
e H 2O2 plays a very important role as a source of ●OH generation in Fenton´s reaction. e response
surface of total phenols removal gradually increased with increasing H  2 O2 concentration from 1.6 to 4.4
g L-1. is can be explained due to a large amount of H 2O2. Consequently, the additional production of
hydroxyl radicals can occur.
e adequacy of the proposed model for TP oxidation of stripped sourwater by Fenton process was
evaluated at the optimum operating conditions. According to the model, the optimum conditions were:
hydrogen peroxide concentration of 4.4 g L-1 and iron concentration of 162 mg L-1, prediction 90.7%Thiago Atsushi Takashina, et al. Sourwater treatment by fenton process and its effect on phytotoxi...

of TP degradation. Under these optimal conditions, new experiments were conducted in triplicate and a
TP degradation 89.9% was achieved, which is in agreement with the oxidation predicted by the model.
Furthermore, for the entire range of the tested factors, the experimental results are very close to the predicted
values obtained from the model.
e high amounts of reagents necessary to obtain removal of total phenols can be explained by the nature
of the eﬄuent which contains predominantly recalcitrant compounds. Besides that, it decreases the process
eﬃciency due to intermediates compounds, which can trap hydroxyl radical to react with the hydroxyl radical
producing less reactive radicals. In relation to the concentration of iron, if the amount of Fe2+ is high, the
●OH radicals are trapped by Fe2+ ions in excess. Furthermore, the high concentrations of iron are not
desirable for two practical reasons: the cost of the reagent and the need of iron sludge treatment ( Bautista,
Mohedano, Gilarranz, Casas, & Rodriguez, 2007 ; Garcia-Segura, Bellotindos, Huang, Brillas, & Lu, 2016 ) .
Regarding H 2O2 high concentration, this may be due to recombination of hydroxyl radicals and also hydroxyl
radicals’ reaction with H 2O2, contributing to the HO● scavenging capacity.
erefore, this model of sourwater degradation by Fenton process is applicable for H 2O2 concentration
between 1.6-4.4 g L-1 and iron concentration between 59-162 mg L-1. Consequently, the amount of
catalyst (Fe2+) has greater eﬀect on the TP degradation than the amount of H 2O2. Other studies have
also demonstrated that the impact of catalyst (Fe2+) dosage has a more pronounced eﬀect on contaminant
removal in the Fenton process ( Tony & Bedri, 2014 ; Brink et al., 2017 ) .
Kinetic models
e kinetic parameters and corresponding determination coeﬃcient (R2) obtained by kinetics models for
the degradation of total phenols of stripped sourwater are presented in Table 4 .
e determination coeﬃcient (R2) above 0.99 found by the mathematical kinetic model suggests that this
model is better suited to describe the experimental data during the Fenton oxidation.
Figure 2  shows total phenols decay curves of stripped sourwater for diﬀerent Fenton conditions for the
three kinetic models.

of reaction, rapid pollutant degradation is attributed to high HO● concentrations, as a result of greater
amounts of Fe2+ catalyst in a solution that reacts with H 2O2. At the second stage, Fe3+ ions were combinedThiago Atsushi Takashina, et al. Sourwater treatment by fenton process and its effect on phytotoxi...

with H 2O2 to produce weaker oxidant radicals compared to HO●, in addition to their slower rate of
production ( Luna, Silva, Nogueira, Kummrow, & Umbuzeiro, 2014 ) .
e parameters obtained by the mathematical kinetic model 1/m (initial TP degradation - Equation 11 )
and 1/b (maximum TP degradation - Equation 12 ) was also correlated with operational parameters (H 2O2
and Fe concentrations) regarding coded factors.
(11)
(12)
e ANOVA analysis shows that the linear terms of iron concentration (Fe) aﬀect the initial rate TP
degradation (1/m) and maximum TP degradation (1/b). e hydrogen peroxide concentration (Pe) also
inﬂuence the maximum TP degradation (1/b).
Toxicity assay
For bioassays, the experiments were conducted only in the factorial conditions of experimental design and
added a central point, resulting in ﬁve experiments. Means values of IC 50 were compared for each treatment
by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey test at the signiﬁcance level (p < 0.05) ( Table 5 ).
e absolute germination (AG) and the germination index (GI) were strongly inhibited by the presence
of soluble toxic compounds in non-treated sourwater.
Regarding treated stripped sourwater by Fenton process, the absolute germination (AG) obtained was
greater than 80%. is fact may be related to the low concentration of toxic compounds, which were
insuﬃcient to aﬀect the germination process.
From IC 50 values, the ANOVA analysis was applied with Tukey test (p < 0.05) to evaluate the diﬀerence
among the Fenton treatments. It was shown that H 2O2 concentration was the factor that aﬀected the most
the inhibition concentration (IC 50). For treated sourwater, the experiments using a lower concentration
of H 2O2 presented higher IC 50. Accordingly, treatments using the highest initial concentration of H2O2
resulted in lower inhibition growth concentration (IC 50). In these cases, treated sourwater showed greater
degradation of total phenols, but probably the generation of oxidation intermediates inhibited the root
growth and presented lower values of GI and IC 50.Acta Scientiarum, 2019, vol. 41, January-December, ISSN: 1806-2563 1807-8664

Conclusion
e CCD full factorial design combined with response surface methodology was applied to the treatment of
sourwater by Fenton process. e iron concentration was the factor that aﬀected the most the total phenol
degradation of the process. e optimal reaction conditions were H 2O2 concentration 4.4 g L-1 and iron

e mathematical model based on the studies of Chan and Chu (2003) and Behnajady et al. (2007)  was
suitable for describing the kinetic total phenols degradation of sourwater by Fenton process.
In general, treated sourwater by Fenton process revealed an improvement in the eﬄuent quality, due to
the results presented germination rate above 80% with Lactuca sativa .
e overall results of this study indicate that the application of Fenton´ reagents is a feasible treatment
due to its easy handling, allowing to achieve a satisfactory degradation of total phenols. e use of RSM and
kinetic models allow predicting the results of TP degradation of Fenton reagents. e use of a simple tool
such as the toxicity test using L. sativa allows the assessment of the quality and eﬀectiveness of the eﬄuent
treatment system.
