This review analyzes the current state of a speciﬁc niche of microalgae cultivation;heterotrophic growth in the dark supported by a carbon source replacing the traditionalsupport of light energy. This unique ability of essentially photosynthetic microorganisms isshared by several species of microalgae. Where possible, heterotrophic growth overcomesmajor limitations of producing useful products from microalgae: dependency on light
which signiﬁcantly complicates the process, increase costs, and reduced production of
potentially useful products. As a general role, and in most cases, heterotrophic cultivationis far cheaper, simpler to construct facilities, and easier than autotrophic cultivation tomaintain on a large scale. This capacity allows expansion of useful applications fromdiverse species that is now very limited as a result of elevated costs of autotrophy;consequently, exploitation of microalgae is restricted to small volume of high-valueproducts. Heterotrophic cultivation may allow large volume applications such as waste-water treatment combined, or separated, with production of biofuels. In this review, wepresent a general perspective of the ﬁeld, describing the speciﬁc cellular metabolismsinvolved and the best-known examples from the literature and analyze the prospect ofpotential products from heterotrophic cultures.

1. Introduction
Large-scale microalgal production has been studied for
decades ( Becker, 1994; Lee, 2001 ), given the wide variety of
practical and potential metabolic products, such as foodsupplements, lipids, enzymes, biomass, polymers, toxins,pigments, tertiary wastewater treatment, and “green energy”products that can be obtained. These products were achievedby cultivating the microalgae on diverse mineral media,organic substrates, and synthetic or real wastewaters ( Pulz,
2001; de-Bashan et al., 2002, 2004; Pulz and Gross, 2004;Lebeau and Robert, 2006; Harun et al., 2010 ).
Today, the most common procedure for cultivation of
microalgae is autotrophic growth. Because all microalgae are
photosynthetic, and many microalgae are especially efﬁcient
solar energy convertors, microalgae are cultivated in illumi-nated environments naturally or artiﬁcially. Under autotro-phic cultivation, the cells harvest light energy and use CO
2as
a carbon source. The introduction of sufﬁcient natural orartiﬁcial light to allow massive growth and dense populationsis the main objective and a limiting factor of the cultivation:the more light, up to a limit for the species, the better(Mandalam and Palsson, 1998; Yang et al., 2000; Suh and Lee,
2003 ). Therefore, as practiced with other microbial commu-
nities producing economic products, open ponds that mimic
natural environments of microalgae are the most common
option for mass cultivation ( Oswald, 1992; Tredici, 2004 ).
Large open outdoor pond cultivation for mass algal
production of single-cell protein, health food, and b-carotene
(Borowitzka and Borowitzka, 1989; Wen and Chen, 2003;
Carvalho et al., 2006; Chisti, 2007 ) is one of the oldest indus-
trial systems since the 1950s ( Oswald, 1992 ). Large open ponds
can be built of glass, plastic, concrete, bricks, or compactedearth in a variety of shapes and sizes. The most common is the“raceway pond”, an oval form resembling a car-racing circuit(Lee, 2001; Pulz, 2001; Chisti, 2007 ). These cultivation systems
present relatively low construction and operating costs andthe large ones can be constructed on degraded and nonagri-cultural lands that avoid use of high-value lands and cropproducing areas ( Chen, 1996; Tredici, 2004 ).
All these beneﬁts notwithstanding, open ponds have
several inherent disadvantages: (1) Poor light diffusion insidethe pond, decreasing with depth. It is aggravated when culti-vation is intensive and causes self-shading. Consequently,
shallow depth is required for ponds and they have a low
volume to area ratio; (2) Mono-cultivation of the desiredmicroalgae is difﬁcult to maintain for most microalgae speciesbecause of constant airborne contamination, except forextremophile species; (3) Environmental growth parametersof cultivation rely primarily on local weather conditions,which may not be controlled and make production seasonal;(4) Harvesting is laborious, costly, and sometimes limited bylow cell densities; (5) Continuous and clean water is needed;and (6) Production of pharmaceutical or food ingredients is notfeasible or is very limited ( Chen, 1996; Tredici, 1999; Molina
Grima et al., 1999, 2003; Lee, 2001; Pulz, 2001; Wen and Chen,
2003; Sansawa and Endo, 2004; Carvalho et al., 2006; Chen
and Chen, 2006; Chisti, 2007; Patil et al., 2008 ).
To overcome inherent disadvantages of using open, less
controlled environments, numerous closed photo-bioreactors(PBR) of various volumes and shapes have been designed(Molina Grima et al., 1999; Tredici, 1999, 2004; Tsygankov,
2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Barbosa, 2003; Suh and Lee, 2003;Zijffers et al., 2008 ). The principle ﬁnal goal of any PBR is
reduction in biomass production costs. This has been done byimproving catalysts, shaping of the PBR, controlling environ-mental parameters during cultivation, aseptic designs, and
operational approaches to overcome rate-limiting of growth,
such as pH, temperature, and gas diffusion. Overcoming theselimitations make monocultures and production of pharma-ceutical and food goods possible ( Cooney, 1983; Chen, 1996;
Apt and Behrens, 1999; Pulz, 2001; Wen and Chen, 2003;
Lebeau and Robert, 2006 ).
Similar to the open-pond concept, large-scale PBRs have
three major disadvantages that make them uneconomical for
low-cost end-products: At operational volumes of 50 e100 L or
higher, it is no longer possible to disperse light efﬁciently andevenly inside the PBR ( Chen, 1996; Pulz, 2001 ); development of
algal bioﬁlm fouls PBR surfaces and thereby limiting lightpenetration into the culture. A high initial investment ininfrastructure and continuous maintenance is required(Carvalho et al., 2006 ). Nonetheless, numerous applications of
PBR for microalgae were proposed and were reviewed ( Apt and
Behrens, 1999; Lebeau and Robert, 2006; Mun ˜oz and Guieysse,water research 45 (2011) 11e 36 12Author's personal copy
2006; Moreno-Garrido, 2008; Brennan and Owende, 2010;
Harun et al., 2010 ). Therefore, this approach will not be dis-
cussed in this essay.
A feasible alternative for phototrophic cultures in PBRs, but
restricted to a few microalgal species, is the use of their hetero-
trophic growth capacity in the absence of light, replacing theﬁxation of atmospheric CO
2of autotrophic cultures with organic
carbon sources dissolved in the culture media. Heterotrophy isdeﬁned as the use of organic compounds for growth ( Droop,
1974). Heterotrophs are organisms whose substrate and energyneeds are derived from organic compounds synthesized by otherorganisms ( Kaplan et al., 1986 ). The basic culture medium
composition for heterotrophic cultures is similar to the auto-trophic culture with the sole e xception of adding an organic
carbon ( Tsavalos and Day, 1994 ). Mixotrophic growth regime is
a variant of the heterotrophic growth regime, where CO
2and
organic carbon are simultaneously assimilated and both respi-
ratory and photosynthetic metabolism operates concurrently(Kaplan et al., 1986; Lee, 2004 ). In some open-pond cultivations,
organic carbon, such as acetate and glucose, are added contin-
uously in small quantities. This is done to support highermicroalgal biomass and simultaneously prevent excessivebacterial growth, which would be the outcome if the organic
substrates were added in large quantity. Adding organic carbon
substrate is usually done only during daytime hours, otherwisefaster growing bacteria would outperform the microalgae underdark heterotrophic conditions. This fed-batch culture process isoften limited to only one culture cycle to avoid bacterialcontaminants from accumulating to unacceptable levels(Abeliovich and Weisman, 1978; Lee, 2001 ). Some microalgal
species are not truly mixotrophs, but have the ability of switch-ing between phototrophic and heterotrophic metabolisms,depending on environmental conditions ( Kaplan et al., 1986 ).
The heterotrophic growth approach eliminates the two
major deﬁciencies of illuminated autotrophic PBR: allowingthe use of practically any fermentor as a bioreactor, such asthose used for industrial production of medicines, beverages,food additives, and energy and yielding, as a major outcome,a signiﬁcant reduction in costs for most processes ( Gladue and
Maxey, 1994 ;Lee, 1997 ). Cost effectiveness and relative
simplicity of operations and daily maintenance are the mainattractions of the heterotrophic growth approach. A side butsigniﬁcant beneﬁt is that it is possible to obtain, heterotro-phically, high densities of microalgae cells that provides aneconomically feasible method for large scale, mass productioncultivation ( Chen, 1996; Lee, 2004; Behrens, 2005 ). For
example: under some heterotrophic cultures, the growth rate,
the dry biomass, ATP generated by the supplied energy, andthe effect on ATP yield (mg of biomass generated by each mgof consumed ATP), lipid content and N content are signiﬁ-cantly higher than under autotrophic cultures and are mainlydependent on the species and strain used ( Martı ´nez and Oru ´s ,
1991; Chen and Johns, 1996a,b; Ogbonna et al., 2000; Shi et al.,
2000; Yang et al., 2000, 2002; Behrens, 2005; Boyle and Morgan,2009 ). Under some heterotrophic growth conditions, the
microalgal biomass yields are consistent and reproducible,reaching cells densities of 50 e100 g of dry biomass per liter
(Gladue and Maxey, 1994; Radmer and Parker, 1994 ), much
higher than the maximum 30 g l
/C01of dry cell biomass in
autotrophic cultures ( Javanmardian and Palsson, 1991 ) andcomparable to the 130 g l/C01of yeast dry biomass of commer-
cial fermentors ( Chen, 1996 ).
Heterotrophic cultures containing as large as 100,000 l can
generate useful biomass reaching hundreds of kilograms.These large volumes and high productivity of cultures makethe heterotrophic strategy far less expensive than the auto-trophic approach ( Radmer and Parker, 1994 ). For example, in
Japan, biomass production of Chlorella spp. use heterotrophic
cultures to generate w500 ton of dry biomass, representing
w50% of total Japanese production of this algae ( Lee, 1997 ).
Mixotrophic cultivation was also shown to be a good strategyto obtain a large biomass and high growth rates ( Ogawa and
Aiba, 1981; Lee and Lee, 2002 ), with the additional beneﬁt of
producing photosynthetic metabolites ( Chen, 1996 ).
Heterotrophic cultures have several major limitations:
(1) There is a limited number of microalgal species that cangrow heterotrophically; (2) Increasing energy expenses andcosts by adding an organic substrate; (3) Contamination andcompetition with other microorganism; (4) Inhibition ofgrowth by excess organic substrate; and (5) Inability toproduce light-induced metabolites ( Chen, 1996 ). Nonetheless,
many recent studies show that heterotrophic cultures aregaining increasing interest for producing a wide variety of
microalgal metabolites at all scales, from bench experiments
to industrial scale ( Apt and Behrens, 1999; Yang et al., 2000;
Lee, 2001; Sansawa and Endo, 2004; Wen and Chen, 2001a,2003; Li et al., 2007; Brennan and Owende, 2010 ).
This review critically analyzes the processes and cases
solely where heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae ispossible to explore the potential and usefulness of thisapproach. It presents cases of autotrophic growth only forcomparison or when similar mechanisms operate underautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. It focuses on:(1) Basic metabolic processes of the microalgae; (2) Environ-
mental parameters affecting growth and metabolism; (3)
Kinetic parameters, such as speciﬁc growth rates and biomassproduction, and (4) Actual and potential end-products and by-products that can be obtained from heterotrophic microalgalsystems. Finally, we discuss some promising avenues ofresearch.
2. Nutrient metabolism by microalgae in
heterotrophic culture
2.1. Key issues in heterotrophic growth of microalgae
Heterotrophic cultivation is inappropriate for most micro-
algae and more species are obligate autotrophs than faculta-tive heterotrophs ( Lee, 2001; Behrens, 2005 ). Yet, some species
are effectively grown in complete darkness and thus theircultures can be grown in conventional dark fermenters. Chen
and Chen (2006) listed the required initial characteristics that
a microalgae species must have to be useful for heterotrophiccultivation: (a) Faculty of cell division and active metabolismsin absence of light. (b) Ability to grow in culture media witheasy-to-sterile organic substrates where energy required forheterotrophic growth must be supplied by oxidation of part ofthe organic substrate ( Droop, 1974 ). (c) Ability to adapt to fastwater research 45 (2011) 11e 36 13Author's personal copy
environmental changes, and (d) Capacity to resist hydrome-
chanical stress inside the fermentors.
In a broad sense, all organisms, including microalgae, use
the same metabolic pathways for respiration. As expected, the
metabolism of microalgae generally resembles, with onlyminor differences, that of higher plants. However, it is impos-sible to precisely predict which speciﬁc substrates can be usedor preferred by any given microalgae ( Neilson and Lewin, 1974 ).
During respiration, oxygen is consumed and CO
2produced.
The respiration rate of any organic substrate is intimatelygeared to growth and cell division. The rates of endogenousrespiration and of O
2uptake vary through the cell cycle ( Lloyd,
1974 ). Dark respiration rates (mol O 2mol carbon/C01d/C01) increase
with growth rates. Under optimal conditions, respiration ratesare about 20 e30% of growth rates ( Geider and Osborne, 1989 ).
In microalgae, dark respiration of an organic substrate assim-ilated from the medium has rates varying from 0.01 to 0.6 d
/C01.
This dark respiration plays two major roles in microalgae: (a) Itserves as the exclusive source of energy for maintenance andbiosynthesis under dark environment and (b) It providesessential carbon skeletons for biosynthesis under any growthcondition. Physiological regulation of respiration is assumed tobe controlled by demand for the products of respiration
metabolism, such as energy in the form of ATP and NADH and
carbon skeletons provided by the organic substrate ( Geider and
Osborne, 1989 ). Under heterotrophic growth conditions,
respiration rates equal or exceed the theoretical minimum costof biomass synthesis. Values for CO
2evolved per carbon (C)
incorporated into new biomass (CO 2/C) equaled 0.4 e1.4 for
several Chlorella species and diatoms. This indicates that
biomass synthesis during heterotrophic growth conditions canproceed at nearly the maximal theoretical efﬁciency, sinceCO
2/C ratios for autotrophic growth are much lower than
values for heterotrophic growth ( Raven, 1976 ).
Independent of the supplied organic substrate or the
microalgae species, growth rates are enhanced by higher levelsof aeration ( Grifﬁths et al., 1960 ). Oxygen supply is a key factor in
heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae. For example, the limi-tation of oxygen in a culture may reduce the speciﬁc growth rateofChlorella spp. and thus lower the productivity of biomass
when cell density is high ( Wu and Shi, 2007 ). Species of the
genera Chlorella ,Tetraselmis ,a n d Nitzschia grew at higher rates
under heterotrophic compared to autotrophic systems ( Endo
et al., 1974; Day et al., 1991; Gladue and Maxey, 1994; Chen andJohns, 1995; Lee, 2001; Shi and Chen, 2002; Boyle and Morgan,2009 ). Additionally, under cyclic cultures of autotrophic/
heterotrophic conditions, cell production of biomass of Chlorella
is about 5.5 times higher than under autotrophic cycles alone,
where cells were producing 16 times more ATP under hetero-trophic culture ( Yang et al., 2000 ). In diatoms, heterotrophic
growth is linked to their ability to maintain photosynthesis
under dark environments using chloro-respiration to protectcells from photo damage after light returns; heterotrophicgrowthinthiscaseisaidedbyhighlipidaccumulation,aproductof reduced carbon in the absence of light ( Wilhelm et al., 2006 ).
In addition to the initial parameters for heterotrophic
cultivation listed earlier ( Chen and Chen, 2006 ), the main
practical key issues in large-scale heterotrophic cultures ofmicroalgae are: (a) Good survival of the strain during cultiva-tion, (b) Its robustness, (c) Overall low cultivation costs,reﬂected as the ability of the strain to efﬁciently use inexpen-
sive, common carbon sources, tolerate environmental changes,
and generate economical worth in the quantity of the metab-olite(s), and (d) At the industrial level, the strains must also beeasy to handle; its cell walls must withstand hydrodynamicand mechanical shear occurring in large bioreactors and itshould produce high density biomass, all in minimally modi-ﬁed fermentors used for other microorganisms ( Day et al., 1991;
Gladue and Maxey, 1994; Chen and Chen, 2006 ). Consequently,
these requirements reduce even further the microalgal strainsthat can be employed and use of available carbon sources. Sofar, the latter consists of glucose, glycerol, acetate, wastewater,
and to a lesser extent, a few other organic carbon sources.
Glucose is available to the great majority of heterotrophic algaeand galactose and fructose are also somewhat used, butdisaccharides are less generally available and, of the polyhydricalcohols, only glycerol is frequently used ( Droop, 1974 ).
2.2. Carbon metabolism
2.2.1. Assimilation of glucose
Glucose is the most commonly used carbon source for
heterotrophic cultures of microalgae, as is the case for manyother microbial species. Far higher rates of growth andrespiration are obtained with glucose than with any othersubstrate, such as sugars, sugar alcohols, sugar phosphates,organic acids, and monohydric alcohols ( Grifﬁths et al., 1960 ).
This may happen because glucose possesses more energycontent per mol compared with other substrates. For example,glucose produces w2.8 kJ/mol of energy compared to w0.8 kJ/
mol for acetate ( Boyle and Morgan, 2009 ). Glucose promoted
physiological changes in Chlorella vulgaris , which strongly
affects the metabolic pathways of carbon assimilation, size ofthe cells, volume densities of storage materials, such as starchand lipids grains ( Martinez et al., 1991 ) and protein, chloro-
phyll, RNA, and vitamin contents ( Endo et al., 1974 ).
Oxidative assimilation of glucose begins with a phosphory-
lation of hexose, yielding glucose-6-phosphate, which isreadily available for storage, cell synthesis, and respiration. Anequivalent of a single phosphate bond is required per mole ofglucose assimilated into glucose-6-phosphate. In that process,an additional 30 equivalents of phosphate bonds are generated
by aerobic oxidation of a mole of glucose ( Droop, 1974 ). Of the
several pathways used by microorganisms for aerobic glycol-
ysis (breakdown of glucose), apparently only two: the Emb-deneMeyerhof Pathway (EMP) and the Pentose Phosphate
Pathway (PPP) have been shown in algae ( Neilson and Lewin,
1974 ). Algae cannot metabolize glucose under anaerobic-dark
conditions because insufﬁcient energy is liberated duringdissimilation of glucose and also retarded by low levels of theenzyme lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27), which is essentialto complete the anaerobic fermentation process ( Droop, 1974;
Neilson and Lewin, 1974 ). Of 100% of glucose taken up by
microalgae, about 1% remainsas free glucose. More than 85% of
the glucose is assimilated and converted to oligo-(mainly
sucrose, w50%) and polysaccharides (mainly starch, w30%)
(Tanner, 2000 ). Some microalgae species, such as Prymnesium
parvum and Dunaliella tertiolecta are unable to assimilate
glucose even though they possess the enzymes necessary forits metabolism ( Neilson and Lewin, 1974 ).water research 45 (2011) 11e 36 14Author's personal copy
Probably the most notable difference in glucose metabolism
in heterotrophic growth of microalgae, in comparison with
autotrophic glucose metabolism or other non-carbohydrateorganic substrates, is that under darkness, glucose is mainlymetabolized via the PPP pathway ( Fig. 1 ,Table 1 ), while the EMP
pathway is the main glycolytic process of cells in light condi-tions ( Lloyd, 1974; Neilson and Lewin, 1974; Yang et al., 2000;
Hong and Lee, 2007 ). Both pathways are carried out in the
Fig. 1 eHeterotrophic metabolism in microalgae. The enzymes are indicated as “gene nomenclature” similar to Table 1 .
Only routes important for heterotrophic growth are shown.water research 45 (2011) 11e 36 15Author's personal copy

cytosol and are functional in microalgae cells. However, the
PPP pathway might have a higher ﬂux rate than the other,
depending on light and the presence of glucose. Some exam-ples illustrate the process. In complete darkness and usingglucose as sole carbon source, the PPP pathway in Chlorella
pyrenoidosa (renamed Chlorella sorokiniana ) accounts for 90% of
glucose metabolic ﬂux distribution via glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase (EC: 1.1.1.49) and the reaction catalyzedby glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC: 5.3.1.9) of the EMPpathway is totally “shifted down” ( Yang et al., 2000 ). In
heterotrophic culture of the cyanobacteria Synechocystis spp.,
the PPP was the major pathway of glucose catabolism via
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase (EC: 1.1.1.44) ( Yang et al., 2002; Hong and Lee,
2007 ). However, the EMP glycolytic pathway is not completely
shifted down, only the key reactions catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (EC: 5.3.1.9), 6-phosphofructokinase (EC:2.7.1.11), and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (EC: 4.1.2.13) areaffected in glucose assimilation, the other reactions of thispathway remain active such as in autotrophic growth ( Yang
et al., 2000, 2002; Hong and Lee, 2007 ). The Tricarboxylic Acid
Cycle (TCA) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylationmaintain high activities in cultures of C. pyrenoidosa , such as in
illuminated environments, which indicate a minor effect oflight on these pathways in this microalga species ( Yang et al.,
2000; Hong and Lee, 2007 ). At the same time, the ﬂux through
the pentose phosphate pathway during illumination was verysmall, resulting from light-mediated regulation. Heterotrophicculture of C. pyrenoidosa generated more ATP from the energy
supplied as glucose than the autotrophic and mixotrophiccultures with energy supplied as light ( Yang et al., 2000 ). In
Synechocystis spp., a multi-level regulatory mechanism of the
enzymes required for glucose metabolism depends on the
energy source available to the cells and this depends on envi-
ronmental conditions, transcription rates, metabolites avail-
ability, and ﬂux requirements. In heterotrophic cultures, theexpression of the genes rbcL (codes for ribulose bisophosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit, EC: 4.1.1.39) and gap2
(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-NADP; EC:1.2.1.59), were down-regulated about two-fold by a light-regu-lated transcription mechanism, while the gene gnd(6-phos-
phogluconate dehydrogenase, EC: 1.1.1.44) was up-regulatedabout 60% in response to an apparent ﬂux of substrate productof that enzyme because the system requires more of theproduct of that enzyme. In contrast, the expression of thegenes prk,fbp, rnpB ,glk,gap1 ,ppc,pfkA ,icd,fum1 (that codes

4.2.1.2) are not affected by the presence or absence of light orglucose, proving that also in cyanobacteria the TCA and manyreactions of the EMP are actively independent of the energy andcarbon sources for the culture ( Yang et al., 2002 ). Compared to
the mixotrophic condition, the mRNA levels of all the genes
were not up or down-regulated signiﬁcantly during autotro-
phic growth. The protein expression pattern under the auto-trophic condition was very similar to that in the mixotrophiccondition; this means that the presence of glucose under illu-
minated conditions did not signiﬁcantly alter the protein
expression proﬁles ( Yang et al., 2002 ).
 Compared to Synecho-
cystis spp., other marine cyanobacteria, such as Prochlorococcus
spp. have an incomplete TCA cycle metabolism lacking keyenzyme genes such as those encoding for malate dehydroge-nase (EC: 1.1.1.37) and succinyl coA eligase (EC: 6.2.1.5).
However some strains of this genus possess alternatively theenzyme
D-lactate dehydrogenase (EC: 1.1.1.28) that allows
recovery of NADþproduced by glycolysis, while transforming
pyruvate to lactate under anoxic environments ( Garcia-
Fernandez and Diez, 2004 ).
Chlorella cells possess an inducible active hexose/Hþsym-
port system responsible for uptake of glucose from themedium ( Tanner, 1969; Komor, 1973; Komor and Tanner, 1974,
1976 ). This mechanism transports sugars and protons with
a stoichiometry of 1:1 ( Komor et al., 1973 ) and the cell invests
one molecule of ATP per molecule of sugar transported(Tanner, 2000 ). The transporter is completely inactive for all
ﬂuxes: inﬂux, efﬂux, and exchange ﬂux, between environ-ment and cytosol when the intracellular pH is below 6.0 and isoptimally active at an extracellular pH of 6.0 ( Komor et al.,
1979 ). In C. vulgaris growing with glucose as the inducer, the
minimum time necessary to induce synthesis of the hexose/H
þsymport system proteins is 15 e18 min ( Haass and Tanner,
1974; Komor and Tanner, 1974 ). Induction of the transporter is
achieved by D-glucose, D-fructose, and D-galactose, but not by
pentoses, sucrose, D-manose, disaccharides, or sugar alcohols
(Komor et al., 1985 ).
The gene corresponding to the hexose/Hþsymport system
protein is the Hexose Uptake Protein Gene ( hup1)( Sauer and
Tanner, 1989 ). The HUP1 protein is a member of the Major
Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporter proteins. The
structure of the hexose/Hþsymport system was reviewed in
detail ( Caspari et al., 1994; Tanner, 2000 ). The mRNA of the
hup1 gene, absent in photosynthetically-grown cells, appears
within 5 min after sugar is added ( Hilgarth et al., 1991 ). The
hup1 gene, the ATP/ADP translocator mitochondrial gene ( aat),
and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene
(gap1 ) are activated when autotrophically grown Chlorella
kessleri cells switch to heterotrophic growth in the presence of
D-glucose. Uptake mutants (HUP1/C0) do not respond to appli-
cation of sugars in this way ( Hilgarth et al., 1991 ).Chlorella cells
in general possess two more hexose transporter genes ( hup2
and hup3 ), co-induced by D-glucose. The other sugars provide
a higher spectrum of sugars speciﬁcity uptake ( Caspari et al.,
1994 ). In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the hxt1 gene is codiﬁed
for the hexose transporter protein through which glucose is
transported through chloroplastic membranes ( Merchant
et al., 2007 ).
Light plays a major role in glucose uptake. In C. vulgaris
cells, light inhibits expression of the hexose/Hþsymport
system. The blue end of the visible spectrum is very effective
at inhibiting the uptake of hexoses where the red end is onlyslightly effective ( Kamiya and Kowallik, 1987a ). Because
a similar photo-inhibiting effect occurred in a non-photo-synthesizing mutant of C. vulgaris , this suggests that photo-
sensitivity is independent of photosynthesis and is performedby the blue-light photoreceptors ﬂavoproteins NPH1 andcryptochromes 1 and 2 ( Kamiya and Kowallik, 1987b; Kamiyawater research 45 (2011) 11e 36 20Author's personal copy
and Saitoh, 2002 ). For Chlorella cells growing with glucose, the
presence of blue light controls numerous metabolic reactions,
such as inhibiting uptake of glycine, proline, and arginine,and ammonia, but enhancing uptake of oxygen and nitratethrough activation of nitrate reductase (EC: 1.7.1.1) ( Kamiya,
1995; Kamiya and Saitoh, 2002 ). Under complete darkness,
glucose in the medium induces expression of two trans-membrane amino acid transport systems. One is for transportof neutral amino acids, such as alanine, proline, serine, andglycine and the other is for transport of the basic amino acids,arginine and lysine. This induction enhances uptake of theseamino acids about 5 e10 times faster than the rates of uptake
reported for any other plant cell in higher plants or algae ( Cho
et al., 1981 ). These enhancing effects were not observed under
red or far-red illumination ( Kamiya and Saitoh, 2002 ). When
microalgae species and strains are able to grow under mixo-trophic regimes, speciﬁc growth rates of the mixotrophiccultures is approximately the sum of the growth rates of cellsunder phototrophic and heterotrophic conditions. Conse-quently, only algal strains that are not sensitive to photo-inhibition are suitable for mixotrophic cultivation ( Lee, 2004 ).
Although it is generally agreed that glucose can serve as
a common carbon source, the precise effects of glucose on
metabolism of microalgae varies greatly and these contradic-
tions may lead to the conclusion that glucose uptake dependsmainly on the quantity of light and the species of microalgaethat is used. Several examples on the effect of glucose onoxygen, pH, and substrate concentration can illustrate thispoint.
Depletion of glucose and fructose in cultures of Galdieria
sulphuraria was accompanied by a rapid increase in concen-
tration of dissolved oxygen in the culture resulting fromdiminished respiration rate caused by complete depletion ofthe original carbon source. An intermittent feeding method for
the microalga was proposed. After the dissolved oxygen
tension increased to >10%, a new batch of substrate was added.
The concentration of sugar was kept sufﬁciently low to serve as
the growth-limiting factor, although the total amount ofglucose that was added was large ( Schmidt et al., 2005 ). For
Schizochytrium limacinum , the concentration of oxygen had no
effect on growth. Differences in sugar consumption and dis-
solved oxygen in the medium could be attributed to the pH ofthe culture and to the strains that were used ( Chi et al., 2007 ).
ForC. vulgaris growing on sufﬁcient glucose, the hexose/H
þ
symport system is induced to promote the alkalinization of theculture media by a net movement of protons accompanied
glucose uptake. Since other sugars can be used, the velocity of
the increase in pH depends on the concentration and type ofsugar used ( Komor and Tanner, 1974 ). Commonly, under low
hexose concentrations, a decrease in pH and sugar consump-
tion occurs. Sugar consumption is apparently linked to a netmovement of protons in sugar translocation through themembrane, yielding a pH-shift ( Komor and Tanner, 1974, 1976;
Komor et al., 1985 ). Consequently, high concentrations of
glucose and glycerol have been shown to inhibit microalgal
growth, at least for a considerable period of time. This is theunderlying reason of the adoption of the feed-batch conﬁgu-
ration of bioreactor operation. This proposed conﬁguration can
maintain a constant low substrate concentration and avoid, inpractical and easy ways, adverse effects on growth and end-product yields ( Tan and Johns, 1991; Cero ´n Garcı ´a et al., 2000;
Wen and Chen, 2000; Schmidt et al., 2005; Xiong et al., 2008 ).
This proposal creates a dilemma: How low is low? It is likely
that this depends on the microalgal species and speciﬁc growthconditions. For example, to promote cellular growth ofC. vulgaris and Scenedesmus acutus , the initial concentration of
glucose should be limited to 10 g l
/C01a n d1gl/C01, respectively
(Ogawa and Aiba, 1981 ). For optimal growth of Chlorella saccha-
rophila , a concentration of glucose of 2.5 g l/C01is required and
inhibition occurred at concentrations >25 g l/C01; inhibition of
C. sorokiniana occurs at concentrations >5gl/C01(Tan and Johns,
1991 ).Chlorella protothecoides has been cultivated at concentra-
t i o n sa sh i g ha s8 5gl/C01to obtain an optimal yield of biomass
(Shi et al., 1999 ). In trials with Nitzschia laevis , yields decreased as
concentration increased from 1 to 40 g l/C01(Wen and Chen, 2000 ).
G. sulphuraria grown with high concentrations of glucose or
fructose up to 166 g l/C01(0.9 M) continued to thrive, but higher
concentrations inhibited growth ( Schmidt et al., 2005 ).
In summary, information on the concentration of glucose
required for optimal metabolic growth is too scattered to reacha deﬁnite conclusion. The answer may be related to speciﬁccombinations of factors, with the microalgal species as themain factor and cultivation and environmental conditions as
secondary factor. Consequently, each combination of factors
may lead to different consumption levels. From the data pub-lished, it appears that glucose might be considered a “preferredsubstrate” for heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae. Micro-algal cells grown on other substrates require a lag period (anacclimation period) to develop the speciﬁc transport systemsnecessary for uptake of other substrates. Consumption of “lesspreferred” substrates is aborted because the enzymes thatcatalyze uptake of an alternate substrate cannot be synthe-sized in the presence of the “preferred” substrate ( Lewin and
Hellebust, 1978; Ratledge et al., 2001; Narang and Pilyugin,
2005 ). This lag phenomenon may not always occur because
other factors, such as the strain used, bioreactor conﬁguration,
and environmental conditions will have a profound impact onuptake of alternative substrates.
2.2.2. Assimilation of glycerol
Heterotrophic growth using glycerol as a substrate has beendemonstrated for several algae, despite the simplicity ofglucose metabolism in microalgae ( Table 1 ). Most of these
species occur naturally in habitats of somewhat elevatedosmolarity, such as seawater and saline pounds ( Neilson and
Lewin, 1974 ). Glycerol as an osmoticum (a substance that has
the capacity of raising the osmotic strength of the solution and
consequently keeps the osmotic equilibrium in cells) is aneconomical carbon source for an energy supply and carbonrequirements and is a very compatible solute for enzymes andmembranes, with almost no toxic effects even at highconcentrations ( Richmond, 1986 ). It is commonly used for long-
term preservation of microorganisms at low temperatures.
Microalgae can produce glycerol as part of the glycerolipid
metabolism because it is a product of hydrolysis of many lipidsthat are glyceryl esters of fatty acids ( Leo´n and Galva ´n, 1999 ). A
few species can assimilate glycerol from the medium, where it
increased their growth rate and induced speciﬁc biochemical
and structural changes in their photosynthetic system, such asreduction of cell phycoerythrin content, degree of tylakoidwater research 45 (2011) 11e 36 21Author's personal copy
packing, number of tylakoids per cell, and the size of Photo
System II particles ( Lewitus et al., 1991 ).
When plant cells are growing on a glycerol substrate, it
enters the cell by simple diffusion ( Neilson and Lewin, 1974 ).
Inside cells, glycerol is used as an osmoregulatory molecule.
Glycerol is ﬁrst phosphorylated using ATP and the glycer-ophosphate is then oxidized to triose phosphate. Plant cellspossess glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30), sn-glycerol-3-phosphateNAD
þoxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.8) and and triose-phosphate
(EC: 5.3.1.1) to convert glycerol into glyceraldehyde-3-phos-phate and glycerate, which are intermediates in the EMPpathway of glycolysis to form pyruvate that enters the TCA
cycle ( Neilson and Lewin, 1974 ). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
may also be formed by reduction of 3-phosphoglycerate, a key
intermediate of the Calvin eBenson cycle of photosynthesis. It
has been demonstrated that sn-glycerol 3-phosphate inhibitsthe reversible glycolytic pathway, as expected in the gluco-neogenesis pathway. Aubert et al. (1994) suggest that the
pentose phosphate pathway is also inhibited when glycerol isthe unique carbon source ( Fig. 1). Glycerol can be photo-
metabolized (photoheterotrophy) by some algae species, such
asAgmenellum quadruplicatum ,Goniotrichium elegans ,Navicula
pelliculosa ,Nostoc sp. These species can only assimilate glyc-
erol as a carbon source, in the presence of light and without
an external supply of CO
2(Ingram et al., 1973; Kaplan et al.,
1986 ).
Glycerol and light were used as substrates for cultivation of
mixotrophic microalgae, yielding signiﬁcant positive results. Forexample, in a culture media supplemented with 0.1 M glyceroland 165 mmol photons m
/C02s/C01,Phaeodactylum tricornutum
increased its growth 74% more compared to autotrophic culture.However, a pronounced lag phase occurred, as explained abovefor growth on substrates other than glucose ( Cero´n Garcı ´a et al.,
2000 ).Nannochloropsis sp.,Rhodomonas reticulate ,a n d Cyclotella
cryptica seem to prefer glycerol over glucose or acetate by using
mixotrophic metabolism and positively responding to environ-mental changes, such as when a nitrate is added to the medium(Wood et al., 1999 ).
When C. vulgaris was immobilized in alginate with Azo-
spirillum brasilense (a microalgae growth-promoting bacteria;
MGPB) and grown autotrophically on synthetic wastewatergrowth medium (SWGM), A. brasilense mitigated environ-
mental stress for the microalgae ( de-Bashan et al., 2002 ). In
another study, major cell growth occurred at pH 8 for A. bra-
silense immobilized with Chlorella , compared to Chlorella grown
alone under autotrophic conditions ( de-Bashan et al., 2005 ). In
similar experiments using joint immobilization carried out
under heterotrophic conditions, an eight-fold increase in thegrowth of C. vulgaris in SWGM containing 0.17 M glycerol after
culturing for 24 h, compared to cultures with C. vulgaris
immobilized alone under the same conditions, where there
was no growth. Similar growth was obtained at pH 8compared to pH 6 and 7 (Escalante F.M.E., unpublished data).This suggests that A. brasilense plays a major role in changing
the metabolic behavior of Chlorella under autothrophic or
heterotrophic conditions.
In conclusion, although glycerol can serve as a substrate
for heterotrophic growth, knowledge of metabolism underheterotrophic conditions is limited. With a potential for bio-diesel production from microalgae (discussed later) whereglycerol is a major by-product and a substrate of the process,
this niche probably will be revived.
2.2.3. Assimilation of acetate
Uptake of dissolved carboxylic acids, such as acetic, citric,
fumaric, glycolic, lactic, malic, pyruvic, and succinic undermicroalgal heterotrophic cultivation has been well known fordecades ( Bollman and Robinson, 1977 ). Acetate (or acetic acid) is
one of the most common carbon sources for many microbialspecies, including microalgae ( Droop, 1974 ). Under dark, aerobic
conditions, eukaryotic cells uptake acetate using the mono-carboxylic/proton transporter protein that aids transport of
monocarboxylic molecules across the membrane. This protein
is a member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily mentionedearlier ( Becker et al., 2005 ). Once inside microalgal cells in the
cytosol, the starting point for acetate assimilation is acetylationof coenzyme A by acetyl-CoA synthetase (EC 6.2.1.1) to formacetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in a single-step catalyzedreaction using a single ATP molecule, as shown in Fig. 1 (Droop,
1974; de Swaaf et al., 2003; Boyle and Morgan, 2009 ).
Acetate (carried by coenzyme A) is generally oxidized meta-
bolically through two pathways: (a) the glyoxylate cycle to formmalate in glyoxysomes (specialized plastids in the glyoxylate
cycle) ( Table 1 ) and (b) through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA)
to citrate in the mitochondria, which provides carbon skeletons,
energy as ATP, and energy for reduction (NADH). Many of theintermediates of both cycles are the same metabolites ( Neilson
and Lewin, 1974; Ahmad and Hellebust, 1990; Boyle and Morgan,2009 ). In general, microalgae that grow by assimilating acetate
must possess a glyoxylate cycle pathway to efﬁciently incor-porate acetyl groups of acetyl-CoA to carbon skeletons. Theoperation of the glyoxylate cycle requires synthesis of isocitratelyase (EC 4.1.3.1) and malate synthetase (EC 2.3.3.9). Bothenzymes are induced when cells are transferred to media con-
taining acetate ( Neilson and Lewin, 1974; Boyle and Morgan,
2009 ). In C. vulgaris, isocitrate lyase, the key enzyme of the
glyoxylate cycle, is synthesized constitutively, but the glyox-
ylate cycle is functional only during growth on acetate ( Harrop
and Kornberg, 1966 ). In Scenedesmus obliquus ,a c t i v i t yo fi s o -
citrate lyase showed nearly a four-fold increase in activity after
24 h in the dark in the presence of acetate. Under heterotrophicconditions, isocitrate lyase activity increased as a function ofincreasing acetate concentration ( Combres et al., 1994 ). In
Chlorella spp. growing on acetate in the dark, the glyoxylate cycle
enzymes are induced but not the TCA cycle enzymes; the latterpathway remains active, but its activity is not enhanced. Light
and glucose suppress the formation of isocitrate lyase ( Goulding
and Merrett, 1967 ). In assimilation by the glyoxylate cycle, 4 mol
of acetate are required per mole of glucose-6-phosphate that is
synthesized, one of the four being consumed in the process(Droop, 1974 ).
InC. reinhardtii growing on acetate, the oxidative pentose
phosphate pathway is also active, providing reducing poweras NADPH for cytosol ( Boyle and Morgan, 2009 ). Additionally,
mitochondrial and chloroplastic electron transport chains are
active in these cells and have a close interaction through theglycolytic pathway ( Rebeille and Gans, 1988 ).
When sodium or potassium salt of acetate is used as
a substrate, the pH rises. This happens because the remain-
ing Na
þor Kþcouples with hydroxyl ions (OH/C0)o ro t h e rwater research 45 (2011) 11e 36 22Author's personal copy
anions to form alkalis. This phenomenon also occurs if
reactors are pH-neutralized with alkali. Since metallic
hydroxides are stronger than organic acids, the media mustbe neutralized or at least brought to a non-inhibitory pH levelby adding an acid, acetic acid for instance, into the cycle(Ratledge et al., 2001). However, acetate does not always
promote growth. It could be toxic for many microorganismsat high concentrations, despite its common use for bufferinghigh pH levels in bioreactors, with the exception of Chlamy-
domonas mundana , which grew rapidly using acetate ( Maciasr
and Eppley, 1963; Wood et al., 1999 ). Keeping the concentra-
tion of acetate at low levels is useful for the fed-batch
conﬁguration in cultures or pH-auxostat (pH is maintained as
a constant). In this way, as long as acetate is consumed, moreacetic acid is added to the reactor, which avoids the rise in pHat the time that more acetate is added ( Wood et al., 1999;
Zhang et al., 1999; de Swaaf et al., 2003; Sijtsma et al., 2005).Although acetate fermentation in pH-auxostats is linked tosuccinic acid production that also inhibits growth, additionof propionate was suggested to provide oxaloacetate to thecells and improve cellular growth ( Fig. 1 ). No explanation was
provided on the mechanism by which propionate wouldalleviate inhibition of acetate in microalgae growing in this
substrate. However, since propionate is a precursor of
oxaloacetate, a possible explanation might be found in workwith the bacterium Pseudomonas citronellolis . One of the
requirements for efﬁcient oxidation of the carbon sourcethrough the TCA cycle is a proper balance between oxaloac-etate and acetyl-CoA. It is likely that elevated concentrationsof acetyl-CoA in cells cultured with acetate would inhibitoxaloacetate decarboxylase. Hence, to maintain the supply ofoxaloacetate, it is necessary to metabolize the acetate via theTCA cycle. Addition of propionate to the culture mediumwould lead to oxaloacetate production by alternative path-
ways ( O’Brien and Taylor, 1977 ). For further details on acetate
metabolism, see Sijtsma et al. (2005) .
Several examples on growing microalgae on acetate are
known. Euglena gracilis strain L incorporates acetate efﬁciently
under light but not in the dark ( Cook, 1967 ). On the other hand,
E. gracilis var. bacillaris incorporates acetate in the dark when
its concentration is below 5 g l
/C01. This strain was able to use
a variety of substrates in heterotrophic cultures, such as
acetate, sucrose, ethanol, amino acids, butyric acid, amonga few other organic substrates ( Cook, 1968 ).Crypthecodinium
cohnii is able to grow in heterotrophic cultures with acetate
concentrations as high as 1 g l
/C01. No higher concentrations
were tested ( Vazhappilly and Chen, 1998 ). Another study with
this strain achieved good growth when cultured in a pH-
controlled, pH-auxostat with 8 g l/C01of sodium acetate
(Ratledge et al., 2001 ). In a recent study ( Perez-Garcia et al., in
press ), when 10 g l/C01sodium acetate was added to municipal
wastewater with C. vulgaris for tertiary treatment, signiﬁcant
heterotrophic growth occurred; however, this did not happen
when calcium acetate was added.
It seems that as long as the level of acetate is low and
remains low, several microalgae can use it as its sole carbonsource. This is speciﬁcally important because acetate is
a readily available and inexpensive substrate derived from
many industrial applications and its use does not imposesevere restrictions on culturing microalgae.2.2.4. Wastewater and other carbon sources for heterotrophic
growth of microalgae
One commonly proposed application of autotrophically grown
microalgae is wastewater treatment ( de la Nou ¨e and Proulx,
1988; de la Nou ¨e et al., 1992; Oswald, 1992; Can ˜izares et al.,
1994; Gonzalez et al., 1997; Lee and Lee, 2001; de-Bashanet al., 2002, 2004; Hernandez et al., 2006 ). The major advan-
tages of these treatments are that additional pollution is not
generated when the biomass is harvested and efﬁcient recy-cling of nutrients is possible ( de la Nou ¨e et al., 1992 ). To date,
this has hardly been tested under heterotrophic conditions
(de-Bashan and Bashan, 2010 ). Nonetheless, Chlorella spp. and
strains of Scenedesmus were isolated from wastewaters kept in
the dark and in oxidation ponds ( Abeliovich and Weisman,
1978; Lalucat et al., 1984; Post et al., 1994 ).C. pyrenoidosa
growing in sterilized sewage were able to use some of the
organic matter, as indicated by a decrease in soluble BOD anddissolved volatile solids in cultures of short retention times.Use of organic compounds was inﬂuenced by the supply ofCO
2to the culture; decrease in the organic matter per unit of
cell weight produced was greater when the supply of CO 2was
low ( Pipes and Gotaas, 1960 ).
Growth characteristics and removal of nutrients from
synthetic wastewater with high acetate and propionate
concentrations were investigated under heterotrophic and
mixotrophic conditions for Rhodobacter sphaeroides ,C. sor-
okiniana ,a n d Spirulina platensis . Heterotrophic cultures of R.
sphaeroides and C. sorokiniana produced the best results under
dark conditions but S. platensis required light. Neither growth
nor removal of nutrients by the cells were affected in syntheticwastewater with as high as 10 000 mgl
/C01acetate, 1000 mgl/C01
propionate, 700 mgl/C01nitrate and 100 mgl/C01phosphate ( Ogbonna
et al., 2000 ). Recently, Perez-Garcia et al. (in press) found that
adding several carbon sources to municipal wastewater thatnormally do not support microalgal growth allowed heterotro-
phic growth of C. vulgaris . Growth effects, in declining order,
was Na-acetate,
D-glucose, D-fructose ¼fulvic acid, Na-
citrate ¼lactic acid ¼acetic acid, malic acid, and L-arabinose.
Other carbon sources such as sucrose, lactate, lactose, and
ethanol have been tested under heterotrophic microalgae
cultures with negative results in growth and metaboliteproduction ( Theriault, 1965; Lewin and Hellebust, 1978;
Ogbonna et al., 1998; Schmidt et al., 2005; Wang and Peng,2008 ). It appears that microalgae do not have invertase to
assimilate sucrose. Komor et al. (1985) report thatdisaccharides
connected to carbon 1 (sucrose) or carbon 4 (maltose) are nottransported; consequently, sucrose uptake by C. pyrenoidosa
(Theriault, 1965 ) and Chlorella zoﬁngiensis (Wang and Peng, 2008 )
is poor. Schmidt et al. (2005) show that G. sulphuraria had
signiﬁcant growth on a sucrose substrate, but only at pH 2. It islikely that sucrose was hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose,which are readily assimilated by microalgae.
While several carbon sources were proposed for hetero-
trophic growth of microalgae, practical evaluation of thecarbon sources show that only a few substrates are supported
by solid evidence. Those include glucose, glycerol, and acetate
in wastewater. None of the other carbon sources tested sup-ported sufﬁcient growth. At this juncture, there are no othercandidates for additional studies of growth. What is stillpending is information about industrial wastes such aswater research 45 (2011) 11e 36 23Author's personal copy
molasses, vinegar, pharmaceutical by-products, and paper
mill efﬂuents. They contain the assimilated low molecular
substrates that microalgae can use and can be mixedwith water to create a substrate for microalgae. If feasible,these mixtures could be designated “prepared wastewatersubstrate”.
2.3. Metabolism of nitrogen sources
After carbon, and apart from hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen isquantitatively the most important element contributing to thedry matter of microalgal cells, accounting from 1 to 10% dryweight. This excludes diatoms, where silicon plays the moreimportant role instead of nitrogen (for review, Martin-Je ´ze´quel
et al., 2000 ) and nitrogen-deﬁcient microalgae that accumulate
oils or polysaccharides ( Kaplan et al., 1986 ). Carbon and
nitrogen metabolism are linked in microalgae because they
share (a) carbon supplied directly from respiration of ﬁxed CO
2
(autotrophic growth) or assimilated organic carbon (hetero-trophic growth) and (b) the energy generated in the TCA cycle
and in the mitochondrial electrontransport chain. The primary
assimilation of inorganic nitrogen (ammonium) to form aminoacids requires carbon skeletons in the form of keto-acids (2-oxaloglutarate and oxaloacetate) and energy in the form of ATPand NADPH to synthesize the amino acids glutamate, gluta-mine, and aspartate. In both autotrophic and heterotrophicgrowing cells, keto-acids, ATP, and NADPH are provided by theTCA cycle ( Huppe and Turpin, 1994; Inokuchi et al., 2002; Lea
and Miﬂin, 2003; Fernandez and Galvan, 2007 ). Very small
quantities of keto-acids were found in Chlorella spp. when
grown autothrophically, but the levels were much higher
under heterotrophic conditions and nitrogen starvation
(Millbank, 1957 ). Respiration rates appear to be limited indi-
rectly by the supply of inorganic nitrogen through the demandof carbon skeletons. This happens following conditions inwhich intracellular carbohydrate energy reserves can accu-mulate, such as under limited nitrogen when carbon is nota limiting factor ( Geider and Osborne, 1989 ).
In general, nitrogen has a marked positive effect on growth
and a negative effect on lipid accumulation. Microalgae areable to assimilate a variety of nitrogen sources, mainlyammonia (NH
4þ), nitrate (NO 3/C0), and urea, as well as yeast
extract, peptone, amino acids, and purines ( Oh-Hama and
Miyachi, 1992; Armbrust et al., 2004; Chen and Chen, 2006;
Wilhelm et al., 2006; Ganuza et al., 2008 ). The metabolic path-
ways involved in nitrogen assimilation are depicted in Fig. 1 .
2.3.1. Assimilation of ammonium
Ammonium is the most preferred nitrogen source for algae. Itis also the most energetically efﬁcient source, since less energyis required for its uptake ( Syreth and Morris, 1963; Goldman,
1976; Kaplan et al., 1986; Shi et al., 2000; Grobbelaar, 2004;Wilhelm et al., 2006 ).
Under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions, ammo-
nium is transported across the membranes by a group ofproteins belonging to the ammonium transporter family(AMT), a group of evolutionarily related proteins commonlyfound in bacteria, yeast, algae, and higher plants ( Wilhelm
et al., 2006 ). Several ammonium transporters, all belonging
to the AMT family, have been identiﬁed in diatoms ( Allenet al., 2005 ). An ample array of transporters for inorganic
nitrogen compounds have been identiﬁed in Chlamydomonas
sp., 8 putative ammonium transporters and 13 putativenitrate/nitrite transporters ( Fernandez and Galvan, 2007 ).
Ammonium transporters can be divided into two distinctsystems: a high afﬁnity system regulated by the nitrogenstatus of cells and a low-afﬁnity system that exhibits a linearincrease in activity in response to increases in ammoniumconcentration ( Howitt and Udvardi, 2000 ). There are excep-
tions. Ammonium transporters in Cylindrotheca fusiformis and
P. tricornutum are not only up-regulated by nitrogen limitation,
but are also expressed at a higher level when grown on nitrate,
compared to ammonium ( Hildebrand, 2005 ).
Ammonium is present in all compartments of the cell. Its
concentration varies, depending on several factors including
the concentration of ammonium in the neighboringcompartment(s), the diferences in pH, and electrical potentialbetween compartments. In compartments where ammoniumis not metabolized, such as the vacuole, the concentration ofammonium may approach its equilibrium value. In compart-ments in which ammonium is metabolized, such as thecytosol and plastids, the steady-state concentration ofammonium may be much lower than the predicted equilib-
rium ( Howitt and Udvardi, 2000 ). Dark respiration of nitrogen-
starved microalgae cells is correlated with inorganic nitrogen
assimilation. Ammonium-enhanced respiration continueduntil either ammonia concentration in the suspendingmedium dropped to an undetectable concentration or intra-cellular carbohydrate energy reserves were almost completelyexhausted. Addition of glucose will allow ammonium assim-ilation to continue, as well as amino acid and proteinsynthesis ( Geider and Osborne, 1989 ).
Assimilation metabolism of ammonium under either
authotrophic or heterotrophic conditions is catalyzed by
glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2), which produces gluta-
mine, and glutamate synthase (GOGAT; EC 1.4.1.14), whichproduces two molecules of glutamate from glutamine plusone molecule of a-ketoglutarate ( Tischner, 1984; Kaplan et al.,
1986; Lu et al., 2005; Vanoni and Curti, 2005 )(Fig. 1 ). Alterna-
tively, ammonium is incorporated into glutamate by thereversible reductive amination of a-ketoglutarate, which is
catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, EC 1.4.1.2)(Inokuchi et al., 2002 ). The GS/GOGAT pathway is regarded as
the primary pathway for ammonium assimilation, while theGDH pathway plays an insigniﬁcant part in the formation ofglutamate. However, the evidence suggests an important role
for GDH as a catabolic shunt to ensure that nitrogen metab-
olism does not affect mitochondrial function and to enablesynthesis of nitrogen-rich transport compounds duringnitrogen remobilization ( Lea and Miﬂin, 2003 ). Additionally,
GDH is believed to be active under conditions of stress ( Lu
et al., 2005 ). Glutamine synthetase, known for its high
afﬁnity for ammonia and its ability to incorporate ammonia
efﬁciently into amino acids ( Miﬂin and Habash, 2002 )i sa n
important enzyme in any photosynthetic organism, even
under heterotrophic metabolism. This enzyme plays a dualrole by providing glutamine for biosynthesis and by assimi-
lating ammonia ( Rahman et al., 1997; de-Bashan et al., 2008 ).
Following incorporation of ammonium into glutamate
through either the GS/GOGAT cycle or GDH, nitrogen iswater research 45 (2011) 11e 36 24Author's personal copy
distributed to the other amino acids, much of it through
transamination with oxaloacetate by aspartate aminotrans-
ferase (EC: 2.6.1.1) to yield aspartate. Through an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by asparagine synthetase (EC:6.3.5.4), an amino group from glutamine is transferred toa molecule of aspartate to generate a molecule of glutamateand asparagine. Glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, and aspar-agine provide the building blocks for the synthesis of organicnitrogen compounds, such as amino acids, nucleotides,chlorophylls, polyamines, and alkaloids ( Inokuchi et al., 2002;
Coruzzi, 2003 ).
Heterotrophic growth conditions do not affect uptake rates
of ammonium and the expression of nitrogen assimilationenzymes but mixotrophic regimen does. For example, addingacetate to autotrophic Scenedesmus obliquus affects its rates of
ammonium uptake. In autotrophy, uptake is17.8 mmol cell
/C01min/C01and is similar to that in heterotrophy
(17.4 mmol cell/C01min/C01), but this is w4 times lower than
occurring under mixotrophy (65.9 mmol cell/C01min/C01)
(Combres et al., 1994 ).R. sphaeroides and C. sorokiniana showed
acceptable growth in darkness in synthetic wastewater sup-
plemented with 10 g l/C01acetate and containing 400 mg l/C01of
ammonia, while S. platensis was completely inhibited under
these conditions ( Ogbonna et al., 2000 ). The nutritional status
of the cells affects ammonium uptake. Nitrogen-limited C.
sorokiniana , without organic carbon in the medium, exhibited
respiratory oxygen consumption (70%) and photosynthetic
oxygen evolution (17%), of cells with sufﬁcient nitrogen. Cellswith sufﬁcient nitrogen absorbed NH
4þin light at a linear rate,
but absorption was totally inhibited by darkness. In contrast,
cells with limited nitrogen absorbed NH 4þat almost similar
rates in light and darkness ( Di Martino Rigano et al., 1998 ).
C. kessleri successfully removes high concentrations of
ammonium or nitrate from synthetic wastewater that is
supplemented with glucose ( Lee and Lee, 2002 ).
A preference for ammonium has clearly been demon-
strated for Chlorella spp. and Dunalliela spp., which can use
a large variety of organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds,
mainly ammonium and nitrate salts, and sometimes urea(Morris, 1974; Kaplan et al., 1986 ). For example, C. sorokiniana
has as much as seven ammonium-inducible chloroplasticGDH isozymes composed of varying ratios of a- and b-
subunits ( Miller et al., 1998 ), indicating a wide spectrum of
adaptation to different environmental conditions. Whenammonium and nitrate are supplied together, Chlorella spp.
preferentially uses ammonium ﬁrst, which is incorporated
into the organic compounds produced by the microalgae. C.
protothecoides ,N. laevis , and P. tricornutum exhibit a preference
for nitrate or urea over ammonium. This happens when the
pH is lowered by consumption of ammonium that inducedsevere reduction of growth and biomass yields when pH wasnot controlled ( Yongmanitchai and Ward, 1991; Shi et al., 2000;
Wen and Chen, 2001a,b; Lee and Lee, 2002 ).
However, when the pH of the culture and other growth
conditions are controlled, ammonium is a reliable nitrogen
source ( de-Bashan et al., 2005 ). For example, P. tricornutum
grew well after adjusting the initial pH to 8 and a fed-batch
conﬁguration was used ( Cero´n Garcı ´a et al., 2000 ). Another
option to control pH and use ammonium as a nitrogen sources
is to add a buffer. Using the same species, adding Tris buffer tothe culture medium avoided a severe drop in pH; yet, some
inhibition of growth occurred even when the buffer alleviated
the side effects of ammonium consumption or pH drop(Yongmanitchai and Ward, 1991 ). However, the acidophilic
microalga G. sulphuraria could be efﬁciently cultured with
ammonium at the expected lower pH because of its naturalcapacity to grow under these conditions ( Schmidt et al., 2005 ).
A practical approach to solve the pH problem of avoiding theadverse effects of ammonium consumption of microalgalcultures is the use of a pH-auxostat feed-batch system(Ganuza et al., 2008 ).
In conclusion, regardless of the negative effects on micro-
algal growth in ammonium-supplemented media, it is still thepreferred nitrogen source if the environmental parameters forproper development of the culture are controlled.
2.3.2. Assimilation of nitrate and nitrite
Nitrate is a major source of nitrogen with a strong impact onmetabolism and growth of plants in general. To assimilatenitrate, plant cells transport it across the membrane and thenreduce it to ammonia, in the process, consuming largeamounts of energy, carbon, and protons ( Crawford et al., 2000 ;
Fig. 1 ). Contrary to the drop in pH observed with ammonium,
nitrate consumption causes an increase in pH.
Studies of higher plants and microalgae suggest that only
two enzymes, nitrate reductase (NR; EC 1.6.6.1-3) and nitritereductase (NiR; EC 1.7.7.1), work sequentially to catalyze nitrateto ammonium ( Kaplan et al., 1986; Fernandez and Galvan,
2007 ). Assimilatory NR catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to
nitrite, using reduced pyridine nucleotides as physiologicalelectron donors ( Gewitz et al., 1981; Nakamura and Ikawa,
1993 ). NiR catalyzes the resulting nitrite; reduction from
nitrite to ammonium uses ferredoxin as the electron donor in
a reaction that involves the transfer of six electrons ( Lopez-
Ruiz et al., 1991 ;Fig. 1 ). NiR is a chloroplastic enzyme, while
NR is located speciﬁcally in the cytoplasm and in pyrenoids of
green algae ( Fernandez and Galvan, 2007; Inokuchi et al., 2002 ).
Environmental variables affect nitrate assimilation. Dark-
ness may have a negative effect on assimilating nitrates. Mostalgae assimilate nitrate more rapidly in the light than in thedark. A direct photochemical reduction of nitrate and nitritehas been observed in chloroplasts. Light reduces cofactorssuch as ﬂavoproteins, ferredoxins, and pyridine nucleotides,which then become used as electron donors for nitrate andnitrite reduction ( Morris, 1974 ). Heavy metals affect nitrate
assimilation in C. reinhardtii . Consumption of nitrate was not
inhibited by metal concentrations below 100 mM. However,
concentrations exceeding 150 mMo fC d
2þ,C u2þ,o rZ n2þ
induced inhibition of 75%, whereas Fe2þor Co2þdid not
signiﬁcantly affect uptake of nitrate. Among the enzymes ofnitrogen assimilatory pathways, exposure of cells for two daysto 100 mMC d
2þdid not affect ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (EC
1.7.7.1), ferredoxin-glutamate synthase (EC 1.4.7.1), or NADH-glutamate synthase (EC 1.4.1.14) activities, but inhibition ofglutamine synthetase activity (EC 6.3.1.2) of 45% occurred(Devriese et al., 2001 ).
In most microalgae, nitrate reductase is fully expressed in
cells growing where the sole nitrogen source is nitrate and it isrepressed in cells growing in media containing excessammonium or a mixture of ammonium and nitrate ( Gewitzwater research 45 (2011) 11e 36 25Author's personal copy
et al., 1981; Di Martino Rigano et al., 1982; Sherman and
Funkhouser, 1989; Cannons and Pendleton, 1994 ). This
further explains the preference of microalgae species like
Chlorella for ammonium and supports the theory that envi-
ronmental factors must be controlled for proper use ofammonium by microalgae, as explained above.
2.3.3. Assimilation of urea and organic nitrogen
Consumption of organic nitrogen by microalgae occurs underautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. All of the organicnitrogen substrates capable of supporting growth under lightconditions are also able to do so in the dark. Growth yields
with organic nitrogen compounds were generally comparable
to those obtained with nitrate or ammonia, although thegrowth rates varied greatly, depending on the organicnitrogen source, the carbon source, and the strain ( Neilson
and Larsson, 1980 ). Growth under heterotrophic conditions
with glucose and acetate has been conducted in threemicroalgae. Selenastrum capricornutum was grown on glucose
and urea, glycine, alanine, arginine, asparagines, and gluta-mine as the organic nitrogen substrate. Chlorella sp. used urea,
glycine, glutamate, glutamine, asparagine, ornithine, argi-nine, and putrescine. E. gracilis grew on acetate, used glycine,
alanine, and glutamine. Urea and glutamine are the mostwidespread organic nitrogen sources that support growth inalgae ( Morris, 1974; Neilson and Larsson, 1980 ).
Some Chlorella spp. can also use urea as the sole source of
nitrogen. It is usually hydrolyzed into ammonia and bicar-bonate before its nitrogen is incorporated into cells. Inmicroalgae, two enzymes can metabolize urea, urease (EC:3.5.1.5) and urea amidolyase (also called urea carboxylase,UALse, EC: 6.3.4.6), but most Chlorella spp. apparently lack
urease ( Kaplan et al., 1986; Oh-Hama and Miyachi, 1992 ) and
metabolize urea by UALse.
The catabolic pathway by UALse is followed by allophanate
lyase (EC: 3.5.1.54) that catalyzes hydrolysis of allophanate,resulting in hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and bicarbonate(Morris, 1974 ). Regardless of the activity, using urea is far less
important in the growth cycle of C. vulgaris than ammonium
and nitrate.
From the data we have so far on nitrogen metabolism under
heterotrophic conditions, it is clear that the order of usinga nitrogen source by most microalgal species is, in decliningorder: ammonium >nitrate >nitrite >urea, where special care
with the concentration of ammonium is a major consideration.
3. Metabolic products and processes using
heterotrophic culture of microalgae
The main driving force to grow microalgae commercially is
harvesting metabolic products, feed for marine and terrestrialorganisms, food supplements for humans, or to use the micro-algae for environmental processes, such as wastewater treat-
ment, fertilization of soils, biofuels, and phytoremediation of
toxic wastes. The main attractiveness of heterotrophic cultiva-tion is that it is potentially substantially cheaper. Many initia-tives have been investigated to produce future products fromm ic ro al ga e,mo st lyatanex pe ri me nt alst ag e( Table 2 ).Ecological
uses of microalgae are not discussed in this review.3.1. Lipids
Several species of microalgae can be induced to overproduce
speciﬁc fatty acids through relative simple manipulations of thephysical and chemical properties of their culture medium. Bymanipulating fatty acid content, microalgae represent a signiﬁ-cant source of unusual and valuable lipids and fatty acids fornumerous industrial applications ( Behrens and Kyle, 1996 ).
Accumulation of lipids in the microalgae cells, as well as forother oleaginous microorganisms (high oil producers), depends
on diverse factors. These include growth temperature, pH,
nutritional imbalances of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, andsilicate, the growth regime (autotrophic, mixotrophic, orheterotrophic),the age ofthe culture,and the speciﬁc microalgalstrain ( Ratledge and Wynn, 2002; Wen and Chen, 2003; Chisti,
2007 ). For example, the lipid content in heterotrophically
grown cells of C. protothecoides isashighas55%, a quantitythat is
up to four times greater that autotrophically grown cultures
under otherwise similar conditions ( Xu et al., 2006 ).
In general, accumulation of lipids in yeast and ﬁlamentous
fungi is associated with exhausting a key nutrient for the
microorganisms, usually nitrogen. After the nutrient becomeslimited or exhausted, carbon uptake continues and is accu-mulated as lipids. It might be the same for microalgae(Zhekisheva et al., 2002; Merzlyak et al., 2007 ).
Several proposalstoexplainthemechanismofaccumulating
lipids were suggested. In the marine Cryptheconidium conhii and
freshwater C. sorokiniana accumulation of lipids may not be
dependent on nitrogen exhaustion but on an excess of carbon inthe culture media. Hence, in autotrophic or heterotrophiccultures, accumulation could be attributed to consumption ofsugars at a rate higher than the rate of cell generation, whichwould promote conversion of excess sugar into lipids ( Chen and
Johns, 1991; Ratledge and Wynn, 2002; deSwaaf et al., 2003 ).This
process is often accomplished in two steps: exponential celldivision leading to decreased growth from limits of nutrients,thereby leading to accumulation of lipids ( Leman, 1997 ). It might
not be only related to higher lipid-synthesizing enzymes under
nitrogen starvation, but to the cessation of other enzymes
associated with cell growth and proliferation and operation ofenzymes speciﬁcally related to accumulation of lipids ( Ratledge
and Wynn, 2002; Ganuza et al., 2008 ).
Another proposed mechanism for accumulating lipids
under heterotrophic conditions used E. gracilis as a model.
Under nitrogen starvation accumulation of lipids is attributedto mobilization of lipids from chloroplast membranes aschloroplastic nitrogen is relocated by 1,5-biphosphatecarboxylase/oxygensae (E.C. 4.1.1.39, Rubisco) ( Garcia-Ferris
et al., 1996 ). This proposal is supported by the fact that
development of chloroplasts is dependent on nitrogen. Chlo-roplast breakdown for the internal supply of nitrogen for thecell under nutrient reduction under dark conditions leads tocell survival and growth in the face of prolonged nutrientshortage if an external carbon source is not supplied.
But limited nitrogen is not always linked to lipid accumu-
lation. Under nitrogen starvation, the diatoms Achnanthes bre-
vipes and Tetraselmis spp. accumulate carbohydrates ( Guerrini
et al., 2000; Gladue and Maxey, 1994 ). This mechanism
supports protein synthesis until the nitrogen supply in themedium is restored ( Guerrini et al., 2000; Granum et al., 2002;water research 45 (2011) 11e 36 26Author's personal copy

Wilhelm et al., 2006 ). Accumulation of lipids in diatoms is
related to depletion of silicates because of their dependence on
silica for growth ( Roessler, 1988; Wen and Chen, 2000, 2003;
Wilhelm et al., 2006 ).
In any of the above cases, the energy storage molecules,
lipids, or carbohydrates, are accumulated. After nitrogenstarvation, microalgae, such as C. pyrenoidosa ,C. sorokiniana ,
Nitzschia alba ,Skeletonema costatum ,C. conhii , accumulate large
amounts of lipids, and diatoms respond to depleted silicatesby accumulating lipids. In general, this behavior is mostprobably a survival response until restoration of less nutri-tionally stressing conditions. As an example in open envi-
ronments, accumulation of lipids is favored when light is the
source of energy. It has been demonstrated that storageproducts are depleted for energy supply according to theirenergy content, from lipids to carbohydrates to proteins(Wilhelm et al., 2006 ). In conclusion, despite the different
mechanisms proposed for energy storage compounds, deple-tion of nitrogen or silicate favors lipid accumulation. Thus, theC:(N or Si) ratio becomes a determining factor in accumulationof lipids and lipid proﬁles.
After nitrogen exhaustion, the remaining sugars play
a determining role on the type of lipids accumulated into the
cells. Saturation of the fatty acids is directly dependent on the
amount of excess sugar and on the autotrophic or heterotro-phic conditions ( Tan and Johns, 1991; Wood et al., 1999; Wen
and Chen, 2000 ). As the concentration of sugar increases,
the fatty acid becomes more saturated ( Wood et al., 1999 ). For
example, C. saccharophila, C. vulgaris ,N. laevis, Cylindrotheca
fusiformis ,Navicula incerta , and Tetraselmis suecica accumulate
more lipids under heterotrophic than under autotrophicconditions, mainly in the form of triglycerides that providemore energy from oxidation than polyunsaturated fatty acidsand therefore, provide superior energy storage ( Day et al.,
1991; Tan and Johns, 1991, 1996; Gladue and Maxey, 1994 ).
Conversely, autotrophic cultures form more highly unsatu-rated fatty acids (polar lipids) ( Tan and Johns, 1991, 1996; Wen
and Chen, 2000 )(Fig. 1 ). In cultures of N. laevis , a cause for
variations in accumulating lipids is the source of nitrogen,with ammonia slightly favoring saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids (C14:0, C16:0, C16:1) and nitrate andurea promoting polyunsaturated fatty acids (C20:4 and C20:5)(Wen and Chen, 2001b ). Despite varied lipid proﬁles of speciﬁc
strains, microalgae mainly accumulate the following fattyacids: (C): 14:0, 14:1, 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, 18:3, 20:4, 20:5,22:5, 22:6 ( Vazhappilly and Chen, 1998; de-Bashan et al., 2002 );
therefore, the microalgae are industrially important for
medicines and nutritional supplements for humans andanimals (polyunsaturated fatty acids), pigments, and lately,biofuels, mainly biodiesel ( Wen and Chen, 2003; Kulkarni and
Dalai, 2006; Chisti, 2007; Del Campo et al., 2007 ).
3.2. Polyunsaturated fatty acids
Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid,
EPA, u-3, C20:5 and docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, u-3, C22:6) are
two important fatty acids in early and old age metabolism inhumans. They have been used in prevention and treatment ofhuman diseases such as heart and inﬂammatory diseases andas nutritional supplements in humans and marine organisms inaquaculture. Because the common source for EPA and DHA, ﬁsh
oil, fails to meet the increasing demand for puriﬁed EPA and
DHA, alternative sources such as microalgae that contain largequantities of high-quality EPA and DHA are considereda potential source of these economically-important fatty acids,especially under heterotrophic conditions that reduced thecosts of production ( Barclay et al., 1994; Vazhappilly and Chen,
1998; Apt and Behrens, 1999; Wen and Chen, 2003; Sijtsma andde Swaaf, 2004; Sijtsma et al., 2005; Chi et al., 2007 ).
Under autotrophic conditions long-chain fatty acids are
assembled from a successive coupling of carbon ecarbon
bounds from acetate and malonyl-ACP (acyl-carrier protein),
beginning with acetyl-CoA as the initial substrate and ending
with acyl-ACP. Acetyl-CoA is produced from pyruvate gener-ated during glycolysis or from free acetate taken into plastids,probably activated by acetyl-CoA synthetase in the stroma.For a typical C18 fatty acid, 16 molecules of NAD(P)H arerequired. In the dark, the pentose phosphate pathway is theproducer of the reduced NADPH ( Somerville et al., 2000 ).
As mentioned earlier, under heterotrophic conditions, the
production of saturated fatty acids is favored, while highly
polyunsaturated fatty acids (C16:3 and C18:3) content aremainly produced under autotrophic conditions. However, the
production of polyunsaturated fatty acids, EPA and DHA, is
higher in dark cultures of the diatoms Tetraselmis spp., N. laevis,
and N. alba (Day et al., 1991; Gladue and Maxey, 1994; Wen and
Chen, 2000, 2003; Chen et al., 2007 ). It was further shown that
microalgae-based heterotrophic production systems canexhibit u-3 fatty acid productivities that are two to three orders
of magnitude greater than those of outdoor autotrophic pondsystems. Additionally, long-chain u-3 fatty acid productivities
reported for the microalgae fermentation systems are one totwo orders of magnitude greater than productivities reportedfor fungal or bacterial systems ( Barclay et al., 1994 ).
The nitrogen source affects production of EPA by the
diatom N. laevis in heterotrophic cultures where nitrate and
urea are preferred N sources for cell growth and EPA content.
Tryptone and yeast extract were found to enhance EPAproduction ( Wen and Chen, 2001a ). Temperature also inﬂu-
ences the fatty acids proﬁle ( Fig. 1 ). When temperature is
below the optimal growth temperature for the microalgae,
more unsaturated fatty acids are metabolized, and the reverseeffect occurs at higher temperatures. Reducing temperatureby 10e15
/C14C leads to a decrease in membrane ﬂuidness. To
compensate for decreasing ﬂuidness, over-expression of thegenes for desaturases (acyl-CoA desaturases, acyl-ACP desa-
turases, and acyl-lipid desaturases) promote desaturation of
the membrane lipids. However, no change in total fatty acidproduction occurs ( Tatsuzawa and Takizawa, 1995; Quoc and
Dubacq, 1997; Sakamoto and Bryant, 1997; Zhu et al., 2007 ).
It was suggested that the lipid 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoylmonoga-
lactosyl-sn-glycerol is involved in the regulation of membraneﬂuidity during temperature acclimation of the cyanobacteriaAnabaena variabilis . This compound increases with increasing
temperature and decreases with declining temperature ( Sato
and Murata, 1986 ). Another plausible explanation for instau-
rations is the positive effect of low temperature on increasing
the molecular oxygen level in cells and promoting the activity
of desaturases and elongases for fatty acids biosynthesis(Richmond, 1986; Wen and Chen, 2003; Chen and Chen, 2006 ).water research 45 (2011) 11e 36 28Author's personal copy
Use of acetic acid as a carbon source for heterotrophic
production of DHA in batch-fed cultures of high cell density of
C. cohnii resulted in much higher lipid and DHA contents than in
cultivation with glucose ( Jiang and Chen, 2000; de Swaaf et al.,
2003 ). This difference may be related to the biochemistry and
subcellular location of acetyl-CoA metabolism. It is likely that,similar to yeasts, the mitochondrial pyruvate edehydrogenase
complex is the main source of acetyl-CoA during growth withglucose. The fatty acid synthetase complex of C. cohnii was
shown to be cytosolic ( Sonnenborn and Kunau, 1982 ), which
suggests that, similar to yeasts ( Ratledge and Evans, 1989 ), lipid
synthesis in this microalga occurs in the cytosol. This implies
that, during growth with glucose, export of acetyl-CoA from the
mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol is required to make itavailable for lipid synthesis. In contrast, acetate can be directlyactivated to acetyl-CoA by the action of acetyl-CoA synthetase(de Swaaf et al., 2003 ).
In summary, studies show that heterotrophic production
of EPA and DHA is feasible at larger production scales than inautotrophic regimes, but this can be accomplished with a fewmicroalgae.
3.3. Biodiesel
Biofuels from microalgae is an attractive option for microalgaebiotechnology. Compared to all other applications, it is one ofthe most attractive, given the high prices of crude oil. Biodieselis a suitable substitute for petroleum-based diesel fuelbecause of its multiple advantages for machines and theenvironment. Currently, biodiesel production depends mainlyon vegetable oils, such as canola, soybean, sunﬂower, and
palm containing long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and to a small
extent on animal fat and oil recycling. This implies seasonalavailability and large expansion of farmland at the expense offood crops. This is a major limitation and sufﬁcient reason tosearch for other sources of LCFA. The current type ofproduction of biodiesel is not sustainable because of theinherent conﬂict with food supply and threat to food security.
Biodiesel from microalgae is an attractive, feasible alter-
native mainly because some microalgae species can signiﬁ-cantly increase production of lipids and cultivation ofmicroalgae is now possible through cheaper heterotrophic
cultivation. Strains can be genetically engineered to produce
the desired fatty acids without negative effects on the envi-ronments. Microalgae, potentially in the longer term, offer thegreatest opportunities compared to oilseed crops. Productivityof many microalgae exceeds the best producing oil cropswhere oil content of many microalgae strains under hetero-trophic conditions is usually 80% of its dry weight and, theirproduction and processing into biofuels, is economicallyeffective, uses currently available technology, and is envi-ronmentally sustainable because their production is notseasonal and the product can be harvested daily. Currentmass production of microalgae requires signiﬁcantly less land
area than crop-based biofuels and releases fewer pollutants to
the environment. Because biofuels from microalgae wasrecently reviewed so extensively from every angle ( Chisti,
2007, 2008; Li et al., 2008a,b; Sharif Hossain et al., 2008; Songet al., 2008; Khan et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2010; Mata et al.,2010; Sivakumar et al., 2010 ), this review will brieﬂy presentonly a few examples, mostly from China with heterotrophic
cultivation. While heterotrophic microalgae cultivation
represents a good source of LCFA ( Wen and Chen, 2003 ); so far,
it is a less popular avenue for biodiesel production frommicroalgae.
C. protothecoides is a suitable microalga for biodiesel
production, heterotrophically using organic carbon sources.This species was able to produce quantities of lipids reachingw50% of its dry weight. Enzymatic transesteriﬁcation (con-
verting lipids to biodiesel) was catalyzed by lipase, and theconversion rate reached close to 100% in several trials. Thebiodiesel was comparable to oil-based diesel and complies
with the US Standard for Biodiesel ( Li et al., 2007; Miao and
Wu, 2006; Xu et al., 2006; Xiong et al., 2008 ). Using C. proto-
thecoides biodiesel was produced from hydrolysate of the Jer-
usalem artichoke tuber under heterotrophic conditions, with
signiﬁcant cost reduction. Accumulated lipid in vivo , with lipid
content as high as 44% of dry mass was obtained and con-verted to biodiesel. Unsaturated fatty acid methyl estersconstituted >82% of the total biodiesel content, of which the
chief components were cetane acid methyl, linoleic acid
methyl, and oleic acid methyl esters ( Cheng et al., 2009 ).
One of the potential carbon sources for producing biodiesel
heterotrophically is glycerol. Currently, glycerol is an inex-
pensive and abundant carbon generated as a by-product ofbiodiesel fuel production. Development of processes toconvert this crude glycerol into higher-value products isneeded. Given the highly reduced nature of carbon atoms inglycerol, fuel and reduced chemicals can be generated athigher yields than those obtained from common sugars, suchas glucose ( Yazdani and Gonzalez, 2007; Murarka et al., 2008 ).
For example: Schizochytrium limacinum produced palmitic acid
(16:0) as w45e60% of their dry weight when supplied with
glucose, fructose, or glycerol ( Yokochi et al., 1998; Chi et al.,
2007 ), which could potentially be used for biodiesel
production.
In summary, production of biodiesel by heterotrophic
microalgae is a very new ﬁeld of research, with little solidinformation available, apart from commercial promises, toindicate the true commercial potential of this source.Considering metabolism in microalgae, cheap carbon sourcesyielding promising amounts of long-chain fatty acids makethis an attractive venue for future research.
3.4. Pigments
In addition to the main photosynthesis pigment chlorophyll,microalgae contain auxiliary photosynthetic pigments toimprove use of light energy (phycobiliproteins) and protectionagainst solar radiation (carotenoids) ( Cohen, 1986; Pulz and
Gross, 2004; Del Campo et al., 2007 ). Naturally, all pigments
are produced under autotrophic growth conditions, butsurprisingly some are produced, and in large quantities, underheterotrophic dark conditions.
3.4.1. Carotenoids
Carotenoids from microalgae have been used for commercialpurposes. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble pigments composedof isoprene units that are widely distributed in various classesof microalgae. Carotenoids are divided into two groups: thosewater research 45 (2011) 11e 36 29Author's personal copy
containing only hydrocarbons (not oxygenated) and xantho-
phylls that contain oxygen molecules ( Cohen, 1986 ). The green
algae class Chlorophyceae, contain aandb-carotenes and the
xanthophylls: lutein, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and neo-
xanthin ( Theriault, 1965; Cohen, 1986 ). For example, auto-
graphically grown Dunaliella sp. is the richest source of lutein.
It contains up to 14% dry weight and is used as a foodsupplement. Natural colorants have become increasinglyimportant because of regulations limiting synthetic additives;with microalgae as a source, carotenoids are one of the majorﬁelds of exploitation of microalgal biotechnology ( Theriault,
1965; Cohen, 1986; Pulz and Gross, 2004; Borowitzka, 2005;
Lebeau and Robert, 2006; Del Campo et al., 2007 ).
Among the xanthophylls (zeaxanthin, canthaxantin, and
lutein), lutein is considered the principal useful pigment of the
group. It has high nutritional value and low toxicity and isused as a pigment for animal tissues (chicken skin and eggyolks coloring), food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical prod-ucts, such as an effective agent for prevention and treatmentof a variety of degenerative diseases ( Shi et al., 1997; Pulz and
Gross, 2004 ). Lutein is an intracellular product of Chlorella . This
genus is used for production of lutein, mainly C. protothecoides
and, to a lesser extent, C. pyrenoidosa and C. vulgaris. Photo-
autotrophic systems produce low biomass; hence, heterotro-phic cultivation represents an alternative. Increasing glucoseconcentration increases lutein production, but urea iscurrently the optimal source of nitrogen ( Theriault, 1965; Shi
et al., 1997, 1999, 2000 ).
Astaxanthin is a red ketocarotenoid colorant used in the
cosmetic, therapeutic, and food industries. In aquaculture, ithas been used to increase growth and survival of aquaticanimals and as a colorant of tissues (farmed salmon, shrimp,lobster, trout, and ﬁsh eggs) to provide a pinkish-red color tothe tissue that is appealing to consumers. Its strong antioxi-
dant character makes it a nutraceutical product (food or
nutritional supplement that may improve health) and mayprevent some cancers ( Hagen et al., 2001; Ma and Chen, 2001;
Pulz and Gross, 2004; Del Rio et al., 2005; Ip and Chen, 2005a;Wang and Peng, 2008 ). Astaxanthin production by microalgae
increases under stress conditions and is present in the esteri-ﬁed form and stored in lipid bodies outside the chloroplast,which enables green algae to accumulate a considerableamount ( Wang and Peng, 2008 ).Haematococcus pluvialis is the
main producer of astaxanthin under autotrophic conditionsbutC. zoﬁngiensis is superior in yield when heterotrophically
cultivated with glucose ( Ip and Chen, 2005a ). Biosynthesis of
astaxanthin in C. zoﬁngiensis starts in the early exponential
phase and is a growth-associated metabolite (product that is
produced only during active growth); therefore, it depends onassimilation of the carbon source. Its production was associ-ated, similar to lipid accumulation, to nitrogen starvation atvery high C/N ratios ( Ip and Chen, 2005a; Wang and Peng, 2008 )
and mainly to the presence of oxidative stress that is essential
for promoting the formation of several secondary carotenoids,including astaxanthin. Such oxidative treatments employ thehydroxyl radical (OH supplied by H
2O2)(Ip and Chen, 2005b ).
Addition of reactive nitrogen species, such as peroxynitrite and
nitryl chloride induced similar effects ( Ip and Chen, 2005c ).
The blue photosynthetic pigment, phycocyanin, is found in
a few cyanobacteria and microalgae; its main source is thecyanobacterium S. platensis . It is used as a ﬂuorescent marker
in diagnostic histochemistry and as dye in food and cosmetics.
The red microalgae G. sulphuraria can produce phycocyanin in
carbon-limited but nitrogen-sufﬁcient heterotrophic cultures;the content increases in the stationary phase. Althoughproduction of phycocyanin in this microalga is lower than in S.
platensis , its ability to grow heterotrophically makes it
a potential supplier of this pigment ( Sloth et al., 2006 ). Another
study found that this microalga produced more phycocyaninin heterotrophic batch-fed cultures of G. sulphuraria than is
commonly attained in outdoor, sunlight-dependent culturesofS. platensis (Schmidt et al., 2005 ). If the heterotrophic process
is scaled up, the reduction of cost using G. sulphuraria would be
signiﬁcant.
In summary, although pigments are traditionally thought
to be the outcome of metabolisms associated with exposure tolight, the capacity of some microalgae to produce some ofthem in the dark under speciﬁc growth conditions opens a lineof research that is barely explored.
3.5. Wastewater treatment
As mentioned earlier, tertiary wastewater treatment bymicroalgae is an old idea that so far has very limited applica-tion. This is directly related to the costs involved in treatingvery large volumes of wastewater in a timely manner underautotrophic conditions ( de-Bashan and Bashan, 2010 ). Hetero-
trophic wastewater treatment is a novel idea that so far hasbeen studied at the laboratory scale. The most efﬁcient carbonsource for using C. vulgaris to treat wastewater heterotrophi-
cally was calcium acetate ( Perez-Garcia et al., in press ). Sub-
jecting the autotrophic, immobilized microalgae-bacteriasystem for wastewater treatment ( de-Bashan et al., 2002, 2004;
Hernandez et al., 2006 ) to heterotrophic conditions revealed
even higher potential of the system to eliminate nutrients(Perez-Garcia et al., 2010 ). The new data cannot provide a solid
prediction about the practical potential of this approach.
4. Concluding remarks and future prospects
Cultivation of microalgae that are primarily photosyntheticunder heterotrophic dark conditions for production ofeconomically useful metabolites or technological processes isa tempting option, given signiﬁcant reductions in complexity ofcultivation and costs. Because heterotrophic growth consumessimple, cheap, and available carbon sources (glucose, acetate,glycerol) that are commonlyusedby fermentation industries forother aims, it is predicted that adoption of this approach is aneasy, uncomplicated task. Fortunately, some of the mostcommon and best-studied microalgae, such as Chlorella , are also
heterotrophs. This information can jump start research inheterotrophy, which is probably quite prevalent among
microalgae ( Tuchman, 1996; Hellebust and Lewin, 1977 ).
Furthermore, with current developments in genomics, bio-
informatics analyses, and genetic and metabolic engineering,new approaches in microalgae biotechnology, includingheterotrophy, have emerged ( Hong and Lee, 2007; Boyle and
Morgan, 2009 ).water research 45 (2011) 11e 36 30Author's personal copy
As a result of genetic engineering, some obligate photo-
autotrophs were transformed to heterotrophy through the
introduction of sugar transporters. Volvox carteri was one of the
ﬁrst green algae to be transformed with the hexose/H þsym-
porter gene derived from Chlorella sp. (Hallmann and Sumper,
1996 ). Similar trophic conversions have also been carried out
inC. reinhardtii (Doebbe et al., 2007 ) and the diatom P. tricornutum
(Zaslavskaia et al., 2001 ). These examples of a simple genetic
transformation of single gene of a sugar transporter in the outermembrane of microalgae show the feasibility to convertmicroalgae from a photoautotrophic into a heterotrophicorganism when sugar is present in the absence of light. Such
genetic engineering is probably acceptable by society because
microalgae cultivation can be independently managed withoutrisk of environmental contamination; thus, these mutants canbe employed in metabolic production of products, such ashydrogen by C. reinhardtii (Doebbe et al., 2007 ).
Adoption of heterotrophy for large-scale industrial
processes, such as wastewater treatment and biofuelsproduction, is somewhat more problematic and lies in themore distant future. Because microalgae cultivation alonecannot sustain biofuel production with the current cultivationtechnologies, perhaps combining two processes, wastewater
treatment followed by biofuel production from the residual
mass will yield a product that would make development ofthese technologies economically acceptable.
Heterotrophic cultivation of microalgae is a niche of
microalgae research ﬁeld. Yet, the potential of expansionbecause of the advantages it offers are limitless. Only time willprove if this strategic approach will catch up with the industry.
