The  degradation  of  Alizarin  Red  S  (ARS)  was  carried  out  by  heterogeneous  advanced  photo  Fenton  pro-
cesses (HAPFP)  of  the  type  Fe0/H 2O2/UV  and  heterogeneous  modiﬁed  photo  Fenton  process  (HMPFP)  of
the type  Fe0/ammonium  persulfate  (APS)/UV.  The  inﬂuence  of  various  reaction  parameters  like  pH,  cat-
alyst loading,  concentration  of  the  oxidants  and  the  inﬂuence  of  inorganic  anions  such  as  Chloride  (Cl−)
and Sulfate  (SO 42−)  ions  on  processes  were  investigated.  Quenching  of  the  hydroxyl  radical  by  inorganic
anions was  conﬁrmed  by  the  decrease  in  the  degradation  rate  constant  for  the  HAPFP  from  3.33  ×  10−2to
0.19 ×  10−2(for  Cl−(1  M))  and  0.29  ×  10−2min−1(for  SO 42−(1  M)).  Similar  decrease  in  rate  constant  for
HMPFP is  from  4.67  ×  10−2to  0.41  ×  10−2(for  Cl−(1  M))  and  0.51  ×  10−2min−1(for  SO 42−(1  M))  process.
The combined  effect  of  concentration  of  sulfate  and  chloride  ions  on  the  rate  constant  for  the  degradation
of ARS  with  APS  and  H2O2as  oxidants  is  investigated.  The  initial  degradation  mechanism  involves  the
cleavage of  a  quinone  group  to  catechol  as  detected  by  UV–visible  and  GC–MS  analysis.

1.  Introduction
Anthroquinone  dyes  represent  the  most  important  class  of
commercial  dyes.  Alizarin  Red  S  (ARS)  belongs  to  the  class  of
Anthroquinone  dyes.  Pollution  of  water  by  these  dyes  is  a  seri-
ous  problem  and  the  removal  of  these  dyes  from  wastewater  is
a  challenge  to  the  related  industries.  Such  stable  compounds  are
difﬁcult  to  destroy  by  common  treatment  methods  because  of  its
ability  to  chelate  with  speciﬁc  cations.  For  the  treatment  of  dye
containing  wastewater,  advanced  oxidation  process  (AOPs)  is  gen-
erally  accepted  as  potential  technique  to  treat  organic  pollutant  in
the  industrial  waste  water.  AOPs  involve  the  generation  of  hydroxyl
radicals  in  situ  which  is  a  powerful  oxidant  and  can  effectively  min-
eralize  almost  all  the  recalcitrant  compounds.  The  most  common
AOP  techniques  include  photodecomposition  of  hydrogen  peroxide
(H 2O2/UV),  photolysis  of  Ozone  (O 3/UV),  photocatalysis  (semicon-
ductor/UV),  Fenton  and  photo  Fenton’s  reactions  (Fe2+/H 2O2/UV)
[1–4] .  Compared  to  all  the  oxidation  processes,  Fenton’s  process
(both  homogenous  and  heterogeneous)  is  relatively  economic  and
simple.  The  disadvantages  of  this  methodology  are  sludge  genera-
tion  due  to  iron,  slow  regeneration  of  Fe2+ions  in  the  solution  and
also  non  reusability  of  the  catalyst  limits  the  efﬁciency  of  the  reac-
tion  especially  in  homogenous  process  [5].  Iron  and  its  oxides  are
widely  explored  in  the  degradation  of  the  pollutants  by  hydroxyl

and  activated  carbon  as  active  catalysts  for  the  oxidation  of  4-
chloropenol  in  the  presence  of  H2O2[10] .  They  concluded  that
metallic  iron  powder  can  replace  iron  salts  as  a  catalyst  in  the  photo
Fenton  process.  The  reduction  of  iron  ions  (from  Fe3+to  Fe2+)  on  the
iron  surface  proceeds  at  a  faster  rate  in  the  heterogeneous  process
compared  to  the  same  reaction  in  the  homogeneous  process.

The advantage of using  solid  metallic  Iron  powder  is  that  it
can  be  easily  removed  through  ﬁltration  or  centrifugation  after  the
treatment.  Contamination  of  Iron  after  the  treatment  is  minimized.
Whereas  in  the  case  of  classical  Fenton  process  Fe2+ions  are  used  as
the  catalyst  and  removal  of  these  ions  from  the  efﬂuent  is  difﬁcult
task.  Hence  it  is  more  advantageous  to  use  Fe0metallic  powder  as
the  catalyst  from  the  environmental  point  of  view.  Moreover,  use
of  Fe0as  catalyst  instead  of  solution  of  iron  salts  prevents  the  addi-
tional  anion  loading  in  the  treatment  of  waste  water.  The  remaining
iron  powder  can  be  easily  removed  and  recycled  after  the  treat-
ment.  The  main  aim  of  the  present  research  work  is  to  use  Zero
valent  metallic  iron  (ZVMI)  of  300  mesh  size  as  a  source  to  gener-
ate  Fe2+ions  in  the  photo  Fenton  process.  Industrial  efﬂuents  are
usually  contaminated  with  various  inorganic  ions.  The  inﬂuence  of
these  ions  on  the  degradation  rate  is  studied  in  detail.  Individual
and  combined  effects  of  Cl−(Chloride)  and  SO 42−(sulfate)  ions  on
the  degradation  rates  were  investigated  in  detail.  Effect  of  inorganic
anions  on  the  photo  degradation  of  ARS  was  studied.  The  efﬂu-
ents  containing  dyes  are  very  difﬁcult  to  treat  because  they  contain

The  present  research  work  mainly  aims  at  studying  the  inﬂuence
of  inorganic  anions  like  Chloride  (Cl−)  and  Sulfate  (SO 42−)  on  the
heterogeneous  advanced  photo  Fenton  processes  (HAPFP)  of  the
type  Fe0/H 2O2/UV  and  Heterogeneous  Modiﬁed  Photo  Fenton  Pro-

2.  Materials  and  methods
2.1.  Materials
Alizarin  Red  S  (ARS),  iron  powder  (300  mesh  size,  electrolytic),
ammonium  per  sulfate  ((NH 4)2S2O8(APS),  and  hydrogen  perox-
ide  H2O2(HP)  (50%  w/v),  sodium  chloride  (NaCl),  sodium  sulfate
(Na 2SO 4)  were  supplied  from  S  D  Fine  Chemicals,  Bombay,  India
and  were  used  as  received.  The  molecular  formula,  formula  weight
and /NAKmax of ARS are  C14H6Na 2O7S  H2O,  360.28  and  514–520  nm
respectively.
2.2. Irradiation procedure
Advanced photo Fenton  experiments  were  carried  out  at  room
temperature  using  a  circular  glass  reactor  whose  surface  area  is
176.6  cm2.  125  W  medium  pressure  mercury  vapor  lamp  is  used
as  the  light  source.  Photon  ﬂux  was  found  to  be  7.92  mW/cm2by
ferrioxalate  actinometry  [11,12] .  The  irradiation  was  carried  out  by
direct  focusing  the  light  into  the  reaction  mixture  in  open  air  condi-
tion at a  distance  of  29  cm.  The  reaction  mixture  was  continuously
stirred.  All  the  experiments  were  performed  using  double  distilled
water. The pH  of  the  solution  was  adjusted  either  by  adding  dilute
NaOH  or  dilute  H2SO 4and  it  is  measured  by  using  Systronics  Digital
pH  meter.
2.3.  Analytical  methods
The  samples  collected  at  different  time  intervals  were  cen-
trifuged and ﬁltered  through  0.45  /H9262m  Millipore  ﬁlter  to  remove  the
catalyst  particles.  The  centrifugates  were  analyzed  by  UV–visible
and  GC–MS  spectroscopic  techniques  using  Schimadzu  UV-1700
Pharmaspec  spectrophotometer  and  GC–MS-QP  5000  Schimadzu
mass spectrometer.  GC–MS  analysis  (using  GC-MS-QP-5000  Shi-
madzu)  and  Thermo  Electron  Trace  GC  ultra  coupled  to  a  DSQ  mass
spectrometer  equipped  with  an  Alltech  ECONO-CAP-EC-5  capillary
column  (30  m  ×  0.25mmi.d.  ×0.25  mm  ﬁlm  thickness)  was  used.
Pure  helium  was  used  as  the  carrier  gas  at  a  ﬂow  rate  of  1.2  ml/min.
The  injector/transfer  line/trap  temperature  was  at  220/250/200◦C
respectively.  Electron  impact  ionization  was  carried  out  at  70  eV.
GC–MS-QP  5000  Schimatzu  mass  spectrometer  was  used  to  identify
the  intermediates  formed  during  the  degradation  process.
3. Results and  discussions
The  various  possible  reactions  taking  place  on  the  Fe0surface
with  the  oxidants  are  illustrated  as  follows:
Under  acidic  conditions  iron  powder  undergoes  oxidation  to
give  ferrous  ions  (Fe2+).
Fe0H+
−→ Fe2+(2)
Iron  powder  in  the  presence  of  H2O2generates  Fe2+ions
which  are  partially  adsorbed  on  iron  surface.  Further,  these  surface
adsorbed  Fe2+ions  can  react  with  H2O2leading  to  the  generation
of  hydroxyl  radicals.
Fe0+  H2O2→  Fe2+surface  +  2OH−(3)Fe0surface  +  H2O2−→ Fe3++  2OH−(4)
Alternatively  iron  powder  can  also  react  with  oxidants  like  H2O2
and  APS  leading  to  the  generation  of  Fe2+ions  in  the  bulk  of  the
solution.
Fe0+  H2O2→  Fe2++  2OH−(5)
Fe0+  S2O82−→  2SO 42−+  Fe2+(6)
These Fe2+ions so formed  can  react with oxidants  leading  to
the generation of  active  free radicals. During this process  Fe2+is
oxidized to Fe3+.
Fe2++ H2O2→  Fe3++  2•OH (7)
Fe2++  S2O82−→  Fe3++  SO 42−+  SO 4−(8)
Ferric  ions  (Fe3+)  so  formed  can  either  react  with  water  or  with
H2O2in  the  following  two  ways:
i) Ferric ions  (Fe3+)  can  react  with  water  molecules  to  form  aqua
complex,  which  on  UV-irradiation  generates  Fe2+ions  and  hydroxyl
radicals.
Fe3++  H2O  ⇔  [Fe(OH)2+]  +  H+(9)
[Fe(OH)2+]  +  hv  →  Fe2++•OH  (10)
ii) Alternatively Fe3+ions can  also  react  with  H2O2leading  to  the
generation of  Fe2+ions  and  hydroperoxyl  radicals.  This  hydroper-
oxyl  radical has the ability  to  reduce  Fe3+ions  and  simultaneously
generate hydroxyl  radicals.  Fe2+ions  thus  formed  in  the  reaction
can  actively participate in the  cyclic  Fenton  reactions  as  described
by all  the  above  equations.
Fe3++  H2O2→  Fe2++•O2H  +  H+(11)
Fe3++•O2H  →  Fe2++•OH  (12)
Fe3+ions  can  also  react  with  persulfate  anion.  Two  molecules  of
sulfate radicals are produced which can  react  with  water  molecule
leading to  the  generation  of  hydroxyl  radicals.
Fe3++  S2O82−→  Fe2++  2SO 4−•(13)
SO 4−•+H 2O  →  SO 42−+•OH  +  H+(14)
3.1. Effect of  pH
Kang et  al.  had  reported  that  the  pollutants  can  be  decolorized
efﬁciently  in  photo  Fenton’s  process  only  under  acidic  conditions
[13] .
In  the  present  study  the  experimentally  observed  degrada-
tion  rate  constants  at  pH  3  are  found  to  be  3.33  ×  10−2and
4.67  ×  10−2min−1with  H2O2and  APS  as  oxidants  respectively
(Fig.  1).  At  pH  3,  the  concentration  of  Fe3+ions  and  Fe  [OH]2+
complexes are  the  dominating  photo  active  species  which  exist  in
almost  equal  proportions.  The  decrease  in  this  optimum  pH  leads
to  decrease  in  the  concentration  of  Fe  [OH]2+complexes  and  it  can
also  result  in  the  precipitation  of  ferrous  ions  as  oxy  hydroxides.
The  various  photoactive  species  of  iron  formed  at  different  pH  con-
ditions  are:  Fe  [H 2O]63+(pH  1–2),  Fe  [OH]  [H 2O]52+(pH  2–3)  and
Fe  [OH] 2[H 2O]4+(pH  3–4)  [14,15] .  The  lower  rate  constant  at  pH
1.5  is  mainly  due  to  the  excess  H+ions  in  the  solution  acting  as
hydroxyl  radical  scavenger  [16]  (Eq.  (15) ).
H++•OH  +  e−→  H2O  (15)
Feng  et  al.  had  reported  that  the  degradation  efﬁciency
decreases  beyond  the  optimum  pH  conditions  (pH  3)  [17] .  DyeL.G.  Devi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Molecular  Catalysis  A:  Chemical  374– 375 (2013) 125 – 131 127

resists  degradation  when  the  solution  pH  is  greater  than  7.  This
is  due  to  the  coagulation  of  Fe3+complex  molecules  in  the  reaction
medium  which  inhibits  the  catalytic  reaction  of  Fe2+ions  with  the
oxidants.  At  high  pH  conditions,  iron  oxy  hydroxide  precipitates
and  gets  deposited  on  the  surface  of  iron  powder  preventing  the
electron  transfer  between  the  catalyst  and  the  oxidant.  This  hin-
ders  the  process  of  formation  of  the  hydroxyl  radicals.  Therefore
both  HAPFP  and  HMPFP  experiments  were  carried  out  at  optimized
condition  of  pH  3.
3.2.  Effect  of  oxidants
The  present  study  investigates  the  application  of  H2O2and  APS
which  are  symmetrical  peroxides  and  can  be  potential  oxidants  in
the  light  induced  reaction  processes.  Persulfate  ions  can  generate
sulfate  and  hydroxyl  free  radicals  and  they  can  provide  free  radical
mechanism  similar  to  hydroxyl  radical  pathways  as  generated  in
the  Fenton’s  chemistry.  Sulfate  radical  is  one  of  the  strongest  oxi-
dizing  species  in  aqueous  media  with  a  redox  potential  of  2.6  V,
which  is  next  only  to  the  hydroxyl  free  radical  whose  redox  poten-
tial  is  2.8  V.  The  sulfate  radical  anions  produced  in  the  case  of  APS
shows  various  possible  reaction  mechanism  in  the  process  of  min-
eralization  which  are  as  follows:  (i)  abstraction  of  hydrogen  atom
from  the  saturated  carbon,  (ii)  The  ions  are  capable  of  adding  to
the  unsaturated  compounds,  (iii)  It  can  remove  an  electron  from
the  anions  and  neutral  molecules  [18,19] .  These  attributes  com-
bine  to  make  the  persulfate  ions  a  viable  option  for  the  chemical
oxidation  of  a  broad  range  of  contaminants.  The  inﬂuence  of  oxi-
dants on  the  degradation  rate  was  investigated  by  maintaining  the
other  reaction  parameters  constant  (Iron  powder  dosage  =  10  mg,
dye  concentration  =  40  ppm  at  pH  3.0  ±  0.04).  When  the  concentra-
tion  of  H2O2was  20  ppm,  the  rate  constant  for  the  degradation
is  3.33  ×  10−2min−1as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  This  is  the  maximum
rate  observed  for  H2O2.  Higher  or  lower  concentration  of  H2O2
decreases the  rate  constant.  This  can  be  due  to  the  recombination
of  excessively  generated  hydroxyl  radicals  or  these  hydroxyl  radi-
cals  may  get  involved  in  the  unwanted  reaction  pathways  as  shown
below:

Similar experiments were carried out  with  APS and its  opti-
mum
 concentration  was  found  to  be  40  ppm  with  a  rate  constant  of
4.67  ×  10−2min−1(Fig.  1).  The  rate  constant  values  calculated  for
the  HMPFP  is  almost  1.5  times  higher  than  HAPFP  (Fig.  1).  This  is
because  of  the  inﬂuence  of  oxidants  on  the  ﬁnal  pH  of  the  reaction
medium.  The  ﬁnal  pH  of  the  solution  was  3.6  for  20  ppm  H2O2and
2.9  for  40  ppm  APS.  Since  APS  provides  better  acidic  pH  condition
which is  most  essential  for  the  photo  Fenton’s  process,  it  accel-
erates  the  rate  of  the  reaction  compared  to  H2O2.  This  favorable
acidity  conditions  results  in  the  higher  concentration  of  the  Fe2+
ions in  the  bulk  of  the  solution  due  to  the  dissolution  of  iron  pow-
der.  This  further  enhances  the  generation  of  hydroxyl  free  radicals.
The  pH  of  the  solution  was  2.12  after  one  hour  of  UV  irradiation  for
higher  concentration  of  APS  (80  ppm).  Hence  rate  constant  drasti-
cally  decreases  to  0.68  ×  10−2min−1.  The  excess  acidity  increases
the  concentration  of  protons  in  the  solution  which  acts  as  hydroxyl
radical  scavenger.  The  observed  higher  pH  in  the  case  of  H2O2
reduces the  concentration  of  photo  active  species  leading  to  the
decrease  in  the  rate  constant.
3.3. Effect  of  catalyst  loading
The  optimization  of  the  catalyst  concentration  is  a  necessary
step in the  photo  Fenton  reaction  mechanism.  The  degradation  efﬁ-
ciency  in  the  absence  of  Fe0catalyst  was  found  to  be  15  and  26
percent  for  H2O2/UV  and  APS/UV  process  for  two  hours  of  irradi-
ation  (Table  1)  respectively.  This  is  due  to  the  direct  photolysis  of
oxidants in  the  presence  of  UV  light.  However  complete  degrada-
tion  and  higher  efﬁciency  was  achieved  by  the  use  of  iron  surface
in  the  presence  of  oxidants.  The  iron  surface  catalytically  decom-
poses  the  oxidants  to  respective  free  radicals/ions  at  a  faster  rate  to
generate  more  hydroxyl  radicals  under  UV  light.  In  contrast,  over-
loading  of  the  catalyst  hinders  the  degradation  efﬁciency.  This  may
be  due  to:  (i)  higher  concentration  of  the  catalyst  results  in  turbidity
which  hinders  the  UV  light  penetration  [20] .  (ii)  Higher  dosage  of
iron powder  increases  the  concentration  of  Fe2+ions  in  the  solution
which  can  also  act  as  hydroxyl  radical  scavenger  [16] .
Fe2++  OH•→  Fe3++  HO−(18)
Additionally  photo  reduction  of  Fe3+to  Fe2+ions  takes  place  at  a
faster  rate  on  the  iron  surface  in  HAPFP  as  shown  by  the  following
equation:
2Fe3++  Fe0→  3Fe2+surface  (19)
The  increase  in  the  dosage  of  iron  powder  shifts  the  reaction  pH
from  acidic  to  alkaline  condition  which  decreases  the  degradation
rate.  The  shift  in  the  pH  mainly  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  oxi-
dants  which  can  be  explained  as  follows:  When  the  catalyst  loading
was  varied  from  10–40  mg,  the  ﬁnal  pH  of  the  reaction  mixture  was
found  to  be  3.6  with  H2O2as  the  oxidant.  The  increase  in  the  cat-
alyst  concentration  to  80  mg  the  pH  of  the  solution  changes  to  4.8.128 L.G.  Devi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Molecular  Catalysis  A:  Chemical  374– 375 (2013) 125 – 131
Turbidity  in  the  reaction  mixture  is  observed  at  this  pH  condition.
With  further  increase  in  the  catalyst  loading  to  150  mg,  excess  iron
precipitates  as  iron  oxy  hydroxide  which  gets  separated  from  the
true  solution  and  the  pH  of  the  solution  changes  to  5.6.  But  in  the
case  of  APS  as  the  oxidant  the  ﬁnal  pH  of  the  reaction  medium  was
found  to  be  3.9  for  all  higher  concentration  of  iron  powder.  Hence
it  can  be  concluded  that  APS  effectively  inhibits  the  precipitation  of
iron  powder  by  providing  excess  acidity  to  the  reaction  medium.
3.4.  Effect  of  initial  dye  concentration
Concentration  of  the  substrate  dye  molecule  affects  the  rate
of  degradation  signiﬁcantly  in  a  photo  Fenton  process.  Therefore
experiments  were  performed  at  different  initial  dye  concentra-
tions  by  maintaining  the  other  reaction  parameters  constant.  The
percentage  degradation  decreases  to  almost  ﬁfty  percent  for  the
100  ppm  initial  dye  concentration.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact
that,  as  the  dye  concentration  increased,  a  proportional  increase  of
hydroxyl  radicals  does  not  take  place.  High  dye  concentration  pre-
vents  the  UV  light  penetration  into  the  depth  of  the  solution,  there
by  decreasing  the  extent  of  generation  of  hydroxyl  radicals  [21] .  As
reported  by  Reis  et  al.  the  active  centers  on  the  iron  surface  will  be
completely  occupied  by  the  dye  molecules  at  high  concentrations
of  the  dye,  which  are  capable  of  reducing  the  catalyst  surface  itself
thereby  hindering  the  process  of  generation  of  hydroxyl  radicals
[22] .  The  HMPFP  shows  higher  efﬁciency  compared  to  HAPFP  at
higher  initial  dye  concentrations.
3.5. Process  efﬁciency  (Ф)
The  process  efﬁciency  (Ф)  implies  the  effectiveness  of  the
present  method.  It  can  be  deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  residual  concentra-
tion  of  the  pollutant  to  the  amount  of  energy  in  terms  of  intensity
and  exposure  surface  area  per  time.
˚  =C0−  C
t.I.S(20)
where C0is  the  initial  concentration  of  the  dye  substrate,  C  is  the
concentration  at  time  ‘t’.  (C0−  C)  denotes  the  residual  pollutant
concentration  in  mg  L−1or  ppm.  ‘I’  is  the  irradiation  intensity.  ‘S’
denotes  the  solution  irradiated  plane  surface  area  in  cm2and  ‘t’  rep-
resents  the  irradiation  time  in  minutes.  Process  efﬁciency  under  UV
illumination  is  expressed  in  ppm  Einstein−1.  Process  efﬁciency  for
the  process  in  the  absence  of  light  is  expressed  as  ppm.  The  results
show  that  the  HMPFP  shows  higher  efﬁciency  compared  to  all  the
other  process  (Table  1).
3.6. Effect of  inorganic  salts  (chloride  and  sulfate)  on  the
degradation  rate  of  ARS
Presence  of  inorganic  anions  like  chloride  and  sulfate  ions  in
the  waste water has  a  signiﬁcant  effect  on  the  overall  Fenton
degradation  reaction  rate  [23] .  The  presence  of  these  anions  in  the
reaction  medium  has  decreased  the  degradation  rate  drastically.
The  ﬁrst  order  rate  constant  (k)  value  for  HAPFP  has  decreased  from
3.33  ×  10−2to  0.28  ×  10−2min−1in  presence  of  chloride  ions  and
0.13  ×  10−2min−1with  sulfate  ions.  Similar  decrease  in  k  value  for
HMPFP  process  is  from  4.672  ×  10−2to  0.22  ×  10−2min−1in  pres-
ence  of  chloride  ions  and  0.33  ×  10−2min−1with  sulfate  ions  as
shown  in  Fig.  1  (Table  1).  In  both  HAPFP  and  HMPFP,  the  rate  con-
stant  decreases  drastically  when  sodium  chloride  is  added.  The
addition  of  sodium  chloride  to  an  aqueous  solution  of  ferric  ions
results  in  the  formation  of  less  reactive  [Fe  (Cl)2+]  and  [Fe  (Cl 2)+]
complexes,  although  [Fe  (OH)2+]  is  still  the  predominant  species
at pH  3.0.  In  the  absence  of  any  added  salt  at  pH  3.0  the  reaction
is  dominated  by  the  photo  reactive  [Fe  (OH)2+]  complex  (Eq.  (10) ).0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.00.10.20.30.40.5Rate constant (k) x10-2 min-1

Further the generated ferrous ions reacts  with  hydrogen  peroxide
forming
 ferric  ions  and  hydroxyl  radicals  as  discussed  previously
(Eqs. (7) and (10) )  [24,25] .  The  various  possible  reactions  that  can
take  place  between  chloride  and  Fe3+ions  are  shown  below:
Fe3++ Cl−↔  [Fe(Cl)2+] (21)
[Fe(Cl)2+]  +  h/GS  →  Fe2++  Cl•(22)
Cl•+  Cl−→  Cl2•−(23)
In  presence  of  sodium  sulfate,  the  degradation  reaction  rate  con-
stant  decreases  drastically  for  both  HAPFP  and  HMPFP.  Sulfate  ions
in  aqueous  solution  can  form  complex  with  both  ferrous  and  ferric
ions  of  the  type:  FeSO 4,  Fe  (OH)2+and  FeSO 4+.  This  reduces  the
concentration  of  the  ferrous  and  ferric  ions  in  the  solution  whose
concentration  is  most  essential  in  Fenton  Chemistry.  At  pH  3.0,
FeSO 4+and  Fe  (OH)2+are  the  major  predominant  ferric  species
present.  On  irradiation  with  UV  light  FeSO 4+produces  ferrous  ions
and sulfate  anions  whose  quantum  yield  is  quite  low  [23,24] .
FeSO 4++  h/GS  →  Fe2++  SO 4−(24)
The  inﬂuence  of  these  anions  on  the  degradation  rate  can  be
summed  up  as  follows:
1)
 Both  Fe  (II)  and  Fe  (III)  ions  form  strong  complexes  with  these
anions, which effect  the  distribution  and  reactivity  of  the  iron
species  present  in  the  solution.
2)  Both  chloride  and  sulfate  ions  scavenge  the  hydroxyl  radicals
leading  to  the  generation  of  the  less  reactive  inorganic  species
like  Cl−•
3)  Dichloride  anion  and  sulfate  radical  anion  are  the  major  pre-
dominant  contributors  for  the  free  radical  degradation  reaction
mechanism  in  presence  of  chloride  and  sulfate  ions.
The
 Cl2•−and  SO 4−•are  oxidant  species  formed  and  they  are
less reactive compared  to  the  hydroxyl  radicals  [26,27] .
4)  In  the  presence  of  UV  light  the  quinone  group  in  the  ARS
molecule  may  interact  more  effectively  with  sulfate  and  chloride
ions  leading  to  a  different  degradation  mechanisms.
3.6.1. Effect  of  sulfate  on  degradation  rate  of  ARS  in  HAPFP  and
HMPFP
In case  of  HAPFP  and  HMPFP  when  the  concentration  of  sodium
sulfate  is  increased  from  0.01  to  0.1  M,  the  rate  constant  increases
slightly as  shown  in  Fig.  2.  The  rate  of  degradation  increases  with
further  increase  of  sodium  sulfate  concentration  to  1  M.  The  excessL.G.  Devi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Molecular  Catalysis  A:  Chemical  374– 375 (2013) 125 – 131 129

sulfate  ions  react  with  water  molecule  leading  to  the  generation  of
the hydroxyl radicals as  shown  below.
Other possible  reactions  at  pH  3.0  are:
H++  SO 42−↔  HSO 4−(25)
HSO 4−+  OH•→  SO 4•−+  H2O  (26)
SO 4•−+  H2O  →  H++  SO 42−+  OH•(27)
SO 4•−+  H2O2→  H++  SO 42−+  OH 2•(28)
SO 4•−+  2OH 2•→  4H++  SO 4•−+  O2 (29)
SO 4•−+  SO 4•−→  S2O82−(30)
Fe2++  SO 4•−→  Fe3++  SO 42−(31)
SO 42−+  Cl•→  SO 4•−+  Cl−(32)
The rate  of  degradation  in  HMPFP  is  high  compared  to  HAPFP,
due  to  the  higher  concentration  of  the  hydroxyl  radicals  generated
in  this  process.
3.6.2.
 Effect  of  chloride  ions
In HAPFP, the  rate  constant  decreases  slightly  when  sodium
chloride  is  added.  In  case  of  HMPFP  process  when  the  concentra-
tion  of  sodium  chloride  is  increased  from  0.01  to  1  M  rate  constant
increases  slightly  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.
Some  of  the  sulfate  radical  anions  (from  APS)  react  with  water
molecule  to  generate  hydroxyl  radicals  (Eq.  (27) ).  Sulfate  ion  can
react  with  chloride  radical  leading  to  the  formation  of  sulfate  anion
radical  (Eq.  (32) )  which  later  yields  hydroxyl  radicals.  Sulfate  ions
can  also  react  with  chloride  radical  to  form  hydroxyl  radical.  There-
fore  the  concentrations  of  hydroxyl  radicals  are  sustained  to  some
extent.  In  case  of  HAPFP  the  rate  of  degradation  decreases  slightly
when  concentration  of  sodium  chloride  is  increased  from  0.01  to
1 M  (Fig.  3).  When  the  chloride  ion  concentration  increases  in  the
photo  assisted  Fenton  reactions  at  pH  3  in  situ  formation  of  the
FeCl2+complex  takes  place  and  this  complex  competes  with  the  Fe
(OH)2+complex  for  UV  light  photons  and  hence  the  rate  of  pro-
duction of hydroxyl  radical  decreases.  Cl−acts  as  a  strong  free
radical  scavenger  and  it  reacts  with  OH•under  acidic  pH  conditions
[28–30] .

 ± 0.04).
ClOH•−+  Fe2+→  Cl−+  OH−+  Fe3+(34)
In  presence  of  chloride  ions  various  inorganic  radicals  like  Cl•,
HClOH•,  ClOH•−,  Cl2•−are  formed  among  which,  the  dichloride
anion  radical  is  predominant  and  hence  a  greater  trend  in  the
decrease  of  the  degradation  rate  is  observed  and  it  inhibits  the
production  of  hydroxyl  radicals  [31,32] .
3.7.  Combined  effect  of  chloride  and  sulfate  ions
Combined  effect  of  concentration  of  chloride  and  sulfate  ions
on  the degradation of  ARS  using  hydrogen  peroxide  and  APS  as  the
oxidants  was  studied.  The  concentration  of  sodium  sulfate  (1  M)  is
kept  constant and concentration  of  sodium  chloride  is  varied  from
0.02  to  0.10  M  for  both  HAPFP  and  HMPFP  as  shown  in  the  Fig.  4.
In  the  case  of  HAPFP  the  rate  constant  increases  from  0.2  ×  10−2
to  0.39  ×  10−2when  the  concentration  of  NaCl  was  varied  from  0.02
to  0.1 M. Similar  increase  in  the  rate  constant  from  0.41  ×  10−2to
0.61  ×  10−2was  observed  for  HMPFP.
The  maximum  retardation  of  the  rate  is  observed  in  case  of
HAPFP  compared  to  HMPFP.  The  maximum  quenching  of  hydroxyl
free  radicals  by  chloride  free  radicals  takes  place  in  the  case  of
HAPFP,  where  hydrogen  peroxide  is  used  as  the  oxidant.  In  pres-
ence  of  UV  light  more  number  of  chloride  free  radicals  are  produced
as  the  concentration  of  sodium  chloride  is  increased.  These  free
radicals  react  with  sulfate  ions  leading  to  the  formation  of  sulfate
anion  radical  (Eq.  (32) )  which  further  generates  hydroxyl  radicals
according  to  Eq.  (27) .
In  the  other  experiment  the  concentration  of  sodium  chloride
(1 M)  is  kept  constant  and  concentration  of  sodium  sulfate  is  varied
from  0.02  to  0.10  M  for  both  HAPFP  and  HMPFP.  The  results  are
shown  in  the  Fig.  5.
In  both  the  cases  the  degradation  rate  increases  gradually  with
increase  in  concentration  of  sodium  sulfate.  The  degradation  rate
is  slightly  high  in  HMPFP  compared  to  HAPFP.  The  concentration  of
sulfate  anions  are  more  in  case  of  HMPFP  compared  to  HAPFP.
The  sulfate  anion  radical  further  participates  in  the  degradation
reaction  mechanism  as  shown  in  the  (Eqs.  (25)–(32) ).  Hydroxyl  and
hydroperoxyl  radicals  are  further  generated.  The  extent  of  produc-
tion  of  these  radicals  and  the  rate  at  which  they  are  produced  will
dictate  the  degradation  reaction  rate.  However  one  can  conclude
that  the  observed  rate  constants  in  the  presence  of  sulfate  and  chlo-
ride  ions  are  very  low  compared  to  the  degradation  reaction  in  the
absence  of  these  ions.130 L.G.  Devi  et  al.  /  Journal  of  Molecular  Catalysis  A:  Chemical  374– 375 (2013) 125 – 131

3.8.  UV–visible  and  GC–MS  analysis
The  /NAKmax of  the  ARS  at  pH  3  is  found  to  be  422  nm  before
the initiation of the reaction. In  the  absence  of  inorganic  salts,
there
 was  continuous  decrease  in  the  absorbance  of  this  peak
in the photo Fenton process. However,  in  the  presence  of  inor-
ganic
 salt,  the  peak  corresponding  to  the  /NAKmax showed  red  shift
to 525–536 nm.  This  shift  was  observed  over  the  entire  concen-
tration  range  of  NaCl/Na 2SO 4and  the  intensity  of  absorbance
increased with  increase  in  the  concentration.  The  GC–MS  analy-
sis  has  been  performed  for  the  experiment  Fe0/APS/UV  (HMPFP)
([ARS]  =  40  ppm,  [Fe0]  =  10  mg  and  [APS]  =  40  ppm  at  pH  3.0  ±  0.04
exposed  to  UV  irradiation)  which  shows  higher  efﬁciency.  During
the degradation process  about  4  ml  of  the  sample  was  withdrawn  at
regular  time  intervals  and  this  solution  was  centrifuged  and  ﬁltered
to remove the  catalyst  particles  present  in  the  solution.  The  samples
were  further  extracted  into  a  non  aqueous  ether  medium  and  1.0  /H9262l
of  each  of  this  solution  is  injected  into  the  GC–MS  instrument.  The
various  major  reaction  intermediates  formed  during  the  process  of
degradation  were  analyzed  by  GC–MS  technique  and  the  results  are
presented  in  Table  2.  Several  low  intensity  m/z  peaks  corresponding
to  the  minor  intermediate  products  were  left  unidentiﬁed.  A  prob-
able  degradation  reaction  mechanism  has  been  proposed  based
on  the  UV–visible  and  GC–MS  spectroscopic  analysis  is  shown  in
Fig.  6.

4.  Conclusion
The  inﬂuence  of  various  inorganic  anions  that  are  commonly
found  in  industrial  efﬂuents  on  the  degradation  mechanism  is  stud-
ied.  Both  sulfate  and  chloride  ions  retard  the  efﬁciency  of  the
process  by  scavenging  the  hydroxyl  radical  and  also  by  forming
the  complexes  with  iron  ions.  These  inorganic  ions  reduce  the  rate
of  generation  of  hydroxyl  radicals  from  Fenton  reagents.  The  maxi-
mum  retardation  of  the  rate  is  observed  in  case  of  HAPFP  compared
to  HMPFP.  However  the  degradation  process  was  not  completely
quenched  since  some  of  the  less  reactive  radicals  like  Cl•,  HClOH•,
ClOH•,  Cl2•−,  SO 4•−,  OH 2•are  formed  and  the  degradation  reaction
is  sustained.  The  extent  of  formation  of  higher  reactive  ions  among
these  ions  will  decide  the  fate  of  the  reaction.  However  one  could
conclude  that  the  most  reactive  radical  is  hydroxyl  free  radical,
higher  reaction  rate  in  the  absence  of  salts  conﬁrms  this  fact.
