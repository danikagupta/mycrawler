Abstract: A 2012 microphytobenthos survey from coral reef environment at Napuka Atoll (Tuamotu Archipe-
lago, South Pacific) focussed on diatom assemblages. Atolls are tropical carbonate, productive ecosystems, 
with a fast turnover, from which benthic diatom floras are poorly known. When compared to younger volcanic 
islands from the same area, Napuka shows a poor colonisation by benthic diatoms. Although normally rare, 
Achnanthales occur in the assemblages from Napuka. In the tidal zone, marine debris of sponge origin were 
colonized by several taxa, among others a small–celled Cocconeis  here described as C. napukensis sp. nov. 
The new taxon has some likeness to Cocconeis subtilissima meiste R and to C. vairaensis RiCaRd. Original 
drawings and type material are examined when available. A lectotypification and an emended description of Cocconeis subtilissima are proposed, along with the description of Cocconeis suzukii sp. nov. and Cocconeis 
meisteri sp. nov. from Meister type material. The morphological features of C. napukensis are investigated with 
scanning electron miscroscope (SEM) and light microscope (LM). Until now C. napukensis has not been found 
in the other investigated sites of Tuamotu and Society Archipelagos.

introduction
The atolls of Napuka (14°10’7”S, 141°13’56”W; 12 
km2, Fig. 1) and Tepoto North (14°08’S; 141° 24’W; 
2 km2) are located in North Tuamotu (Fig. 1), 450 
km South of Marquises Islands. The latter atolls are isolated in a vast oceanic zone, justifying the name 
‘Îles de la Désolation’ or ‘Îles du Désappointement’, 
with their only accompaniment Puka Puka, lying 272 km southeastwards. The westerly South Equatorial Current (SEC) (
tabata  1975; RouGeRie et al. 1997) 
prevents Napuka from being directly influenced by other islands and reinforces its geographic isolation. 
Ornithological studies report Acrocephalus atyphus 
flavidus 
Cibois  & thibault  (2005) to be endemic to 
Napuka. Neither hydrological studies nor taxonomical 
surveys of microalgae are available for Napuka, while 
the hydrology and phytoplankton at Takapoto, a 
nearby atoll of West Tuamotu (Fig. 1), are documented (souRnia & R iCaRd 1975, 1976; maGnieR & W authy  
1976; R iCaRd et al. 1979). Napuka and Tepoto North 
have no direct communication with the ocean, with 
several ‘hoas’ (shallow channels between ‘motus’ –coral sand islands–) permitting intermittent exchange with the open ocean. An endo–upwelling theory explaining the apparent contradiction between the high productivity of South Pacific atolls and the oligotrophy of the surrounding ocean was formulated by 
RouGeRie 
& W authy  (1986): the atoll’s lagoon is fed by deep 
interstitial waters enriched with nutrients. Subsequent studies (
ChaRpy–Roubaud  et al. 1990; leCleRC 1998; 
ChaRpy 2001) support a different theory: the advective 
supply of nutrients by the ocean, combined with a high turnover, explains the nutrient status of the atoll’s lagoon. Organic matter i.e., aggregates, were also shown to constitute a substantial contribution to the trophic systems within the atoll’s lagoon (
maRshall  
1965). Nevertheless, the Chlorophyll a concentration 210                                                                                                                            Riaux–Gobin et al.: Cocconeis napukensis and allied taxa
is higher in the lagoon’s phytoplankton than in the 
adjacent ocean ( kRasni Ck 1973; souRnia & R iCaRd 
1975 ; RiCaRd et al. 1979 and references therein,  
hatCheR 1997). The gross primary production of atolls 
is high ( souRnia & R iCaRd 1975; sou Rnia 1977 and 
references therein) but with diatoms playing a minor 
role among microalgae ( RiCaRd et al. 1979). At Napuka 
(Tuamotu) and Tetiaroa (Society) the marine benthic 
diatoms are relatively rare while they are abundant 
in high volcanic islands such as Tahiti and Moorea 
(pers. obs). On the other hand, dinoflagellates ( stan Ca 
et al. 2013) and Coccolithophoridae are dominant on 
atolls among microalgae, even if less diversified than 
diatoms ( RiCaRd 1979,  and pers. obs.). In the South 
Pacific Ocean the benthic diatoms (linked to sediments 
and macroalgae) from atoll’s lagoon are dominant 
versus typically planktonic ones ( RiCaRd 1979, and 
refs therein).
During the CORal reef DIAtoms (CORDIA) 
2012 project, the Achnanthales flora of Napuka was investigated with a particular focus on Cocconeis , a 
genus pertaining to this order. A small–celled Cocconeis  
taxon first caught our attention and is here described as new: Cocconeis napukensis sp. nov. The latter taxon 
is compared to C. subtilissima 
meiste R (1935), from 
which several later on definitions seem contradictive.
Materials  and Methods
 
Materials used in this study are derived from three sources: 
1) Friedrich Meister’s type material from Nagasaki, Japan 
(Fig. 1), 2) M. V oigt’s slide collection labelled ‘Nagasaki 
off shells’ and 3) a recent marine sample from Napuka Atoll, South Pacific, Tuamotu Archipelago.
Meister’s type material:  F. Meister’s slides are housed 
in Herbarium of the University of Zürich (Switzerland). The 
slides ‘Nagasaki 3409000’ to ‘01’, ‘03’ to ‘08’, ‘10’ to ‘11’ to ‘17’ have been examined (Fig. 1). According to notes accompanying the sample preparation by F. Meister, the first numbers assign the year of preparation, the third and fourth 
number the month, and the last three numbers are sequential 
numbers. F. Meister’s hand written notes assign these slides to the shell of a marine snail from Nagasaki (‘Nagasaki, Japan, auf Meeresschnecken. verunreinigt mit Süsswasserformen’, 
‘Nagasaki, Japan, on marine snail, contaminated with 
fresh water forms’). These slides are supposed to contain Cocconeis subtilissima 
meisteR  (see  meisteR  1935). Some 
Meister’s notes roughly indicate the position of remarkable taxa on the slides. Unfortunately no indication concerning 
Cocconeis subtilissima, but a new Cocconeis is indicated as 
present on the sector ‘c’ of the slide 3409000 (‘Cocconeis  n. 
sp.’). 
V oigt’s slide collection: Several of M. V oigt’s slides 
have been prepared from the same sample (‘Nagasaki off 
shells’, 22045–46–47) and some other slides [‘Nagasaki on 
shells’, 22072(35)–77(35), 22074(35) have probably been 
prepared in 1935, and most probably from the same sample]. These slides are housed in Dübendorf (Switzerland) and they 
have been studied. Hand notes by M. V oigt indicate which 
taxon was found in which slide. Here again, there was no Cocconeis subtilissima. Nevertheless, the slide 22045 was 
examined with particular attention, since it was pointed out 
by M. V oigt to contain Cocconeis trachyderma F. 
meisteR , a 
new species appearing together with Cocconeis subtilissima 
(see meisteR  1935).
Napuka Atoll material (South Pacific, Tuamotu 
Archipelago):  During a 2012 expedition (Coral Reef 
DIAtoms, CORDIA) at Napuka (12 km2) several marine and 
lagoon sites were sampled, particularly tidal debris of sponge 
origin (15NPK7–2, 14°10.702S, 141°15.949W) collected 
from the intertidal bed rock, close to the Napuka airstrip.  
Napuka Atoll material preparation: The sample 
was preserved in formaldehyde (10% final concentration) . 
For scanning electron microscope (SEM) examination, the 
sample was filtered through 1 µm Nuclepore filters and rinsed twice with deionised (milliQ) water to remove salts. 
Filters were air–dried and mounted onto aluminum stubs 
before coating with gold–palladium alloy (EMSCOP SC 500 
sputter coater) and examined with a Hitachi S–4500 SEM 
operated at 5 kV (C2M, Perpignan University, France). For 
light microscope (LM) examination, the sample was washed 
with distilled water to remove salts, treated with 30% H
2O2 
for 2 h at 70 °C to remove organic matter, rinsed several times in distilled water, alcohol–desiccated and mounted on glass 
slides using Hyrax
® (O. Romero pers. com.). Diatom slides 
were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot 200, with differential 
interference contrast (DIC) optics and photographed with a 
Canon PowerShot G6 digital camera (CRIOBE–Perpignan 
University, France). 
The LM illustration of the new taxon from Napuka 
does not give a complete overview of its particular features, i.e., the sternum valve (SV) striation, the exact pattern 
and number of axial rows of alveoli and the valvocopulae. Therefore, according to Article 40.2 of the International 
Code of Nomenclature (
mCneil et al. 2012) we designated 
the SEM stub as the holotype showing the best diagnostic 
features of the new species. Although it is a challenge to

the University of Zürich (Switzerland).permanently preserve specimens on stubs, they are referenced 
and kept in an air–dried container at CRIOBE–Perpignan 
University, France. Isotypes are designated from slides made 
from the same sample in which the new taxon was observed. 
All morphometric data are presented in Table 1.
Terminology and abbreviations: Various termino-
logies have been proposed for the order Achnanthales silv a. 
As previously proposed, in particular by Riaux–Gobin 
et al. (2013), and following the Greek origin of the word 
‘sternum’, it is proposed to designate the valve with a raphe 
as the raphe valve (RV) and the valve without a raphe as the 
sternum valve (SV). For the description of the frustule and 
its parts, terminology follows Anonymous (1975), Ross et al. 
(1979) and Round  et al. (1990).
results
Even if quantitatively rare, some Achnanthales are 
present in marine environments of Napuka, particularly 
in 15NPK7–2, with several species shared with 
the assemblages of Tahiti and Moorea Islands. The complete Cocconeis  assemblage from Napuka, with 
several unique taxa, will be detailed elsewhere 
(Riaux–
Gobin et al. submitted).  A new Cocconeis species, 
closely resembling Cocconeis subtilissima  meisteR  
sensu suzuki  et al. (2000) was found abundantly in 
15NPK7–2 and was present in some other Napuka 
samples, while being absent in other areas yet to be 
studied in the South Pacific (pers. obs.) . 
We first redefine Cocconeis  subtilissima from 
F. Meister’s type material and present two related new 
taxa, Cocconeis suzukii and Cocconeis meisteri, from 
the same assemblage from Nagasaki, and finally we present Cocconeis napukensis sp. nov. from the South 
Pacific.

‘Nagasaki 3409003’(Fig. 1) housed in Herbarium

specimen illustrated in Figs 13 (RV)–14 (SV). Lectotype remarks: None of F. Meister’s slides is annotated as containing Cocconeis subtilissima. 
Nevertheless as indicated by 
meisteR  (1935), the 
sample and the corresponding labelled slides ‘Nagasaki 
off shells’ from 1934 might contain Cocconeis 
subtilissima. The notes about the slide 3409000 
refer to a Cocconeis  n. sp. from sector ‘c’, but the C. 
subtilissima specimen found on this slide (and not 
from sector ‘c’) is inconclusive because of the SV . On 
the other hand, Figs 13–14 illustrate a specimen of C. 
subtilissima showing both valves relatively accurately. 
Lectotype locality: Nagasaki, Japan (from the shell of a marine snail).
Translation of the original German diagnosis: Valve 
elliptical, 28 µm long, 14 µm wide. Raphe valve with 
23 radial transapical striae in 10 µm, raphe markedly 
sigmoid, axial area very narrow, central area roundish, small. Rapheless valve with 34 slightly radial 
transapical striae, interrupted by an apical hyaline band 
in the mid–hemivalve. This band is irregularly defined. Axial area narrow, more or less thin, narrower in mid–valve. fig. 61–62. Nagasaki, very scarce.
Our examinations (LM, n=11): 27.7+1.9 µm long; 
12+0.8 µm wideStria densities: >35 (difficult to discern) SV str. in 10 µm; 26.18+1.17 RV str. in 10 µmL/W: 2.1+0.1
Emended description: Valve oblong–elliptical to 
linear–elliptical, with round to blunt apices, RV striae 
dense, equidistant, radiate in the last third of the valve. Raphe sigmoid particularly clearly at apices, terminal raphe fissures close to the margin distinctly bent in opposite directions, central raphe endings close to 
each other (Figs 16, 18). Axial area narrow, central 
area transapically elongated into a short fascia. SV densely striated, each hemivalve has a hyaline apically elongated area splitting the striae in two parts. Axial area relatively large, with almost no constriction in 
mid–valve.
Remarks: The taxon is relatively rare in the Meister 
type slides, on the eight Meister’s slides observed only 
22 specimens were encountered, and only a SV on the two V oigt’s slides prepared with the same material. Only 11 specimens were clean enough concerning the RV stria densities (Table 1). The SV striae were almost 
indiscernible, even with interferential contrast, while 
F. Meister succeeded in counting 34 str. in 10 µm. The RV fascia described as a small and round central area by 
meisteR  (1935) is well identifiable in his figure 61 
as a black oblong mark.
Cocconeis meisteri riaux–Gobin et al. sp. nov. (LM,

Description: Valve small, elliptical with round apices,

area narrow, small central area. SV densely striated, 
each hemivalve shows a hyaline apically elongate area dividing the striae in two parts. Sternum large, clearly constricted in mid–valve (Fig. 22, arrows).

Remarks: Cocconeis meisteri is not rare in the M.

as C. subtilissima, due to the constriction of their SV 
sternum and referring to the German diagnose of the latter (‘in der Schalenmitte enger’). Nevertheless, the valve shape and the RV features of C. meisteri differ 
completely from those of C. subtilissima.

Remarks: This taxon is not rare on F. Meister’s and 
M. V oigt’s slides. Its shape is rarely elongate, and the SV striation is coarser than in C. meisteri and C. 
subtilissima. Furthermore, the sigmoid SV sternum is 
different from that of C. meisteri. This taxon is similar 
to C. subtilissima 
meisteR  sensu  suzuki  et al. (2000).

Description: Small–celled, elliptic to linear–elliptic 
with round apices (Figs 29 –43).
Sternum valve (SV): Valve face externally strongly convex (Figs 38–41), bi–layered and strongly silicified, with two longitudinal rows of alveoli (up to three in 
larger specimens, i.e., Fig. 43), sternum almost straight 
to very slightly sigmoid, widely lanceolate, with no 
fascia, externally strongly constricted and concave in its mid–part (Figs 38–41). In the biggest specimens, the 
constricted part of the sternum may be a narrow straight 
band (Figs 40, 43). Striae uniseriate, dense, difficult to discern in LM (Figs 29–34). Alveoli regularly radiate, 
externally open by an oblong lumen interrupted by 214                                                                                                                            Riaux–Gobin et al.: Cocconeis napukensis and allied taxaFigs 13–20.

the species was discovered.
Remarks: Cocconeis napukensis SV has some 
similarities with the SV illustrated in sChmidt  (1894) 
pl. 196, fig 8 (specimen on the right) under Cocconeis 
vetusta  a. sChmidt . But the illustrated RV of the latter (left specimen in fig. 8, ref. cit.) has a transverse 
hyaline fascia much larger than in C. napukensis. Also some similarities with the SV illustrated in 
sChmidt  
(1894) pl. 192, fig 2 (reproduced in our Fig. 12), under Cocconeis comis A. 
sChmidt , but with a striation 
less dense than that in C. napukensis. C. comis RV 218                                                                                                                            Riaux–Gobin et al.: Cocconeis napukensis and allied taxaFigs 44–49.

is not illustrated and not enough characteristics are 
mentioned for this taxon to permit a comparison with 
C. napukensis. Cocconeis lorenziana GRunoW  ‘formae 
minores’, in sChmidt  (1894) pl. 191, figs 13–14, 
24–27 (reproduced in our Figs 2–5, 8–9), illustrated by SEM in 
mont Gome Ry (1978, pl. 68, figs E, F), 
has some similarities with our taxon: i.e., presence of two rows of alveoli. But the valve of the latter is less 
elongate than in C. napukensis, and the SV sternum, even if irregular, is not constricted. Furthermore, the 
specimens of C. lorenziana 
GRunoW  ‘formae minores’ 
illustrated in sChmidt  (ref.cit.) have a lower SV stria 
density than C. napukensis. It can be remarked that the 
SEM illustrations by mont Gome Ry (ref. cit.) somehow 
fit the illustrations of C. subtilissima meiste R sensu 
suzuki  et al. 2000, here described as Cocconeis suzukii. 
Several features differentiate  C. napukensis 
from C. subtilissima meiste R sensu suzuki  et al. Fottea, Olomouc, 14(2): 209–224, 2014                                                                                                                             219Figs 50–54. Cocconeis napukensis sp. nov. from Napuka (SEM). External views of the raphe valve (RV): (50, 52, 53) RV of different sizes, 
almost plane, with a slightly sigmoid raphe, regularly spaced and radial striae and narrow axial area; (51) detail showing the apical triangular 
area devoid of areolae and terminal raphe ending close to the margin; (54) detail of the areolae with hymenes showing short marginal slits. Scale bars 3 µm (50, 53); 2 µm (51, 52); 200 nm (54).
2000, here described as Cocconeis suzukii (see above, 
Discussion and Table 1): 1) a smaller length (on average 
14.3 µm long versus 21.1, Table 1), 2) a different outline of the valve (oblong–elliptical to linear–elliptical in C. napukensis), 3) the SV sternum pattern, 
strongly constricted and straight in C. napukensis, 
while clearly sigmoid in Cocconeis suzukii, 4) if the 
RV is relatively similar on both taxa, the raphe terminal fissures in C. napukensis are close to the margin with 
valve apices completely free of areolae (Figs 50, 51, 53), while in Cocconeis suzukii they are far from the 
margin with some areolae present along the margin delineating a small arrow–head area devoid of areolae, 5) the helictoglossae are short and abruptly deflected in opposite directions in C. napukensis (Fig. 56), 
while long and sigmoid in Cocconeis suzukii (see C. 
subtilissima sensu 
suzuki  et al. 2008, fig. 19, arrow), 6) the hyaline line externally delineating each alveolus 
is thin and regular in C. napukensis (Fig. 40–43) while 
larger in Cocconeis suzukii .
C. napukensis also has some similarities with 
Cocconeis  meisteri sp. nov. found in the material of 
Meister (Figs 21–23), but with 1) smaller dimensions, 2) a more elongated shape (L/W 1.8 versus 1.6, Table 1), 3) three alveoli per stria on the bigger specimens versus two for C. meisteri, 4) stria densities higher on 
both valves, and 5) a more pronounced constriction of the SV sternum. 
Cocconeis vairaensis 
RiCaRd (1975, pl. 2, fig. 
21, reproduced in our Figs 10–11) (type slide and raw material not localized) has also some likeness with our new taxon, but is less elongate, has less dense striation and a same stria density on both valves (22–23 str. in 
10 µm, Table 1), its SV sternum is irregular and only 220                                                                                                                            Riaux–Gobin et al.: Cocconeis napukensis and allied taxaFigs 55–59. Cocconeis napukensis sp. nov. from Napuka (SEM). Internal views of the raphe valve (RV): (55) RV showing the small–sized 
central area and the slightly sigmoid raphe; (56) apex of the RV with the short helictoglossa abruptly bent (arrow) and the raphe valve 
valvocopula (RVVC) in abvalvar side; (57) cingular view showing the same details as in Fig. 56; (58) RV with the two valvocopulae still attached; (59) apex with the open (framed arrow) RVVC in advalvar side, with short indentations (white arrows). A copula is indicated (C).Scale bars 4 µm (55); 2 µm (58); 1 µm (59); 700 nm (57); 600 nm (56).
very slightly constricted in the middle, and its RV is 
more deeply sigmoid than that of C. napukensis. 
Finally, C. napukensis can be compared to C. 
subtilissima meisteR  (see above emended description). 
The two taxa differ by their shape (more oblong–
lineal and with blunt apices in C. subtilissima), by 
their RV stria pattern (presence of a short fascia in C. 
subtilissima), and by their SV pattern (no constriction 
of the SV sternum in C. subtilissima). 
It can be remarked that  C. subtilissima and C. 
napukensis concurrently possess a significantly denser striation on their SV , contrarily to C. suzukii and to C. 
vairaensis (Table 1).discussion
First discovered by meisteR  (1935) from a Japanese 
marine sample,  C. subtilissima has been diversely 
interpreted by subsequent authors (i.e., suzuki  et al. 
2000; de stefano  & R ome Ro 2005; suzuki  et al. 
2008; Riaux–Gobin et al. 2011; majeWska et al. 2013) 
entangling its real identity. But, following the original 
description and our examination of the type material, and except for some remarks by F. Meister that were erroneous (i.e, concerning the central area of the RV 
that is in fact a short fascia, and the SV sternum that is Fottea, Olomouc, 14(2): 209–224, 2014                                                                                                                             221Figs 60–65. Cocconeis napukensis sp. nov. from Napuka (SEM). Detail of the cingular bands. The high and complex cingulum is composed of 
the two open valvocopulae (raphe valve valvocopula (RVVC) and sternum valve valvocopula (SVVC), two open copulae (C) and the mantle of 
each valve (VC, RV). (62, 63) particularly show the open RVVC in place (framed arrow, Fig. 63) and crenulated edge of the RVVC in advalvar side (white arrow, Fig. 63). Scale bars 1 µm (60, 61, 63, 64); 500 nm (62, 65).
not constricted), all other points fit exactly and the later 
interpretations were wrong.
In fact,  de stefano  & R ome Ro (2005, pls 
32–33), suzuki  et al. (2008, figs 1–44), Riaux–Gobin 
et al. (2011, pl. 6/3–11, pls 73, 74) and majeWska et 
al. (2014, fig. 2, 31) roughly follow the definition by 
suzuki  et al. (2000). It can be noted that none of the above cited authors examined the original  F. meiste R 
type material. Furthermore, some errors can be pointed 
out: in de stefano  & R ome Ro (2005) pl. 4 figs 1, 2 
are the reproduction of pl. 4, figs 1, 2 of suzuki  et al. 
(2000) and were wrongly attributed to meiste R (1935, 
figs 61, 62). The TEM images in suzuki  et al. (2000, 
figs 3, 4) are reproduced in suzuki  et al. (2008, figs 21, 222                                                                                                                            Riaux–Gobin et al.: Cocconeis napukensis and allied taxa26, with wrong scale bars: –10 µm instead of 5 µm–) 
while the rest of the description somehow differs from the first description by 
suzuki  et al. (2000) (see Table 
1), i.e., the valves illustrated in suzuki  et al. (2008) 
are in major part largely elliptical and not oblong and the stria densities are significantly different. The SEM illustration in 
majeWska et al. (2013, fig. 2,31) is the 
exact reproduction of fig. 1, pl. 32 of de stefano  
& R ome Ro (2005) and not an illustration of their 
Mediterranean material.
In conclusion, Cocconeis subtilissima meisteR  
differs from Cocconeis subtilissima sensu suzuki  et al. 
(2000), and it is the reason why we propose to define the new species Cocconeis suzukii sp. nov. All the taxa 
discussed in the present paper, including Cocconeis 
napukensis sp. nov., Cocconeis  meisteri sp. nov. and 
Cocconeis vairaensis, differ from each other by several of their features (see Table 1 and key). These small–celled marine Cocconeis  probably belong to the same 
group of species. Genetic data would be useful to show

The rich diversity of benthic diatoms from 
tropical and coral reef samples are up till now 
poorly documented (see introduction). Several new 
Achnanthales species and a new genus were recently 
described from the South Pacific ( Riaux–Gobin et 
al. 2013, 2014a), while numerous other taxa are in common with the flora described from the Indian 
Ocean (i.e., Mascarenes, 
Riaux–Gobin et al. 2011). On 
the other hand, it is always time–consuming to explore 
the type collections (when they are found) but it is the only way to get a reliable concept of a taxon. In the case of C. subtilissima, the original photographs gave a good description that was later wrongly interpreted. In the same way, some reference books may give haphazard information if types are not checked (i.e., 
concerning Cocconeis pinnata 
GReGoR y and C. ornata 
GReGoR y in hustedt  1931–1959, Riaux–Gobin et al. 
2014b,c) that can induce subsequent misidentification.
