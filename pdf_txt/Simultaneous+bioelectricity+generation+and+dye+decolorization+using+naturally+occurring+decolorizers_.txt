ABSTRACT: This first-attempt study explored simultaneous dye decolorization and 
bioelectricity generation of indigenous Proteus hauseri  ZMd44 for dye-bearing  
wastewater treatment. Additions of diazo  dye C.I. reactive blue 160 (RBu160) could 
stimulate dye decolorization and bioelectri city generation of ZMd44 in single chamber 
microbial fuel cells (MFCs). However, hi gh-level additions of RBu160 repressed capa-
bilities of power production in MFC due to co mpetition of electrons used for reductive 
decolorization. Decolorized intermediate s of RBu160- phenyl methanediamine and 
5-sulfoanthranilic acid as el ectron shuttles might mediate electron transport for current 
generation in MFC. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
As known, the reductive biodecolorization of az o dyes is strongly re lated to bacterial 
capability of electron transfer (e.g., redu ced coenzyme NADH as electron donor; Chen, 
2002). Meanwhile, microbial fuel cells (MFCs)  can use naturally-occurring microbes as 
renewable electrochemically active biocatalys ts to recover sustai nable energy from the 
oxidation of organic matter and simultaneously f acilitate bioelectrici ty generation during 
wastewater treatment (Du et al., 2007; Sun et  al., 2009). Here, the feasibility study tended 
to recover renewable energy as additional valu es from dye-bearing wastewater treatment. 
We also attempted to uncover whether this  electron-donating capabil ity of bacterial de-
colorizers is also associated  with cell membrane-bound electr on transfer chain for bio-
electricity production in MFCs. The finding al so indicated that supplementations of 
reactive blue 160 (RBu160) simultaneously st imulated color removal and bioelectricity 
generation of P. hauseri . To the best of our knowledge, th ere are no reports indicating the 
feasibility of simultaneous bioelectric ity generation and dye decolorization for  P. hauseri  
as indicated herein. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
MFC Construction. Single chamber air cathode, medi ator-less, membrane-less MFCs 
(ML-MFCs; Han et al., 2010) were  constructed in cylindrical  tubes made by transparent 
polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) (cell sizing OD=59 mm, ID=54 mm, electrode spacing 
L=90 mm) with working volume of ca. 200 mL. The anode electrode was originally con-
structed from activated carbon cloth (without catalyst) (CeTechTM, Taiwan) while a  
hydrophobic carbon cloth (CeTechTM, Taiwan) was used as the matrix of the cathode (a 
projected area of ca. 22.9 cm2 (i.e., π × 2.72)). The air cathode was almost identical to the anode in size and consisted of a polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) diffusion layer (CeTechTM, 
Taiwan) on the air-facing side. Prio r to construction for MFC, 3.0% H 2O2 was completely 
filled in the chamber for 1 day for comple te sterilization (Chen et al., 2009). H 2O2 was 
completely rinsed and washed out by sterile de ionized-and-distilled water after 1 day static 
incubation prior to study. For cell propagation in MFCs, cell culture of strain ZMd44 was 
first carried out as described elsewhere (Zha ng et al., 2010). Then, cultured cells were 
sterilely added into MFCs at 30 °C for cell propagation in MFC and cell immobilization 
onto the anode for approx. 20 days. 
 
MFC Operations. (a) Acclimation step : Approximately 100 mL cultured broth was 
well-mixed with ca. 100 mL fresh LB medium in  MFCs for acclimation. One half of a fresh 
medium was added to replace the old broth in  MFC every week. To ensure immobilized 
cells well entrapped on anode  in MFC, the output voltage  of MFC was continuously 
monitored using external resistance of 1 K Ω. When no escalation of voltage emerged and 
reproducible output voltage profiles were re vealed after new me dium was added, MFC 
was considered as successfully acclimate d. This steady-state and reproducible power 
generation of MFC (ca. 80 ±5 mV) was stably achieve d after ca. 20 days. (b) Experimental 
step: In MFC, 100h was selected as the time in terval for study observation to ensure no 
other limiting factors restrict cell metabolic  activity during operation. For simultaneous 
dye decolorization and bioe lectricity generation of P . hauseri , fed-batch mode of MFC 
operation with impulse injection of RBu160 at di fferent levels was carried out. That is, 5.0 
mL of 8.8x LB broth laden w ith appropriate  concentrations of RBu160 (e.g., final con-
centrations of 450, 900, 1350, 560 mg L-1) was serially added into the ML-MFC for 
comparative analysis.

FIGURE 1. Serial decolorization of RBu160 and current generation curves  
of simultaneous color removal and bioelectricity generation of  
Proteus hauseri ZMd44 in MFC (external resistance = 1 K Ω). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Effects of RBu169 on Bioe lectricity Generation. This first-reported comparison on per-
formance of bioelectricity generation in MFC at various concentrations of RBu160 (i.e., 0, 
450, 900, 1350, 560 mg L-1; Figure 1) showed that impulse supplementation of RBu160 
considerably repressed the peak  output voltages of bioelectri city production in MFCs. The 
maximum cell-voltage gradually decreased as  supplementations of RBu160 progressively 
increased (ca. 245, 197, 152, 109 mV for RBu 160= 0, 450, 900, 1350 ppm, respectively; 
Figure 1). The decreased peak output voltage at high loading of RBu160 might suggest that 
reductive decolorization and bi oelectricity generation of P . hauseri  are competitive to each 
other as both reactions all utilized electrons  released from bacterial oxidation of organic 
matter. In addition, possibly due to accumula tion of decolorized intermediate(s) of RBu160 
as mediators, the steady-state (SS) cell voltage s were stabilized at slightly higher levels 
than the SS-voltage in RBu160-free MFC.  
According to mechanisms of electron transfer  in MFCs, the major driving mechanism of 
bioelectricity generation seemed to be the electron ﬂow through a conductive bio ﬁlm ma-
trix containing cytochromes or other membra ne-associated electron carriers, but not the 
direct electron transfer via outer-surface redox protein (i.e., the lag phase to generate 
electricity was not significantly observed in  this mediator-less ML-MFC). When the 
bioﬁlm matrix was involved in electron transport, the ratio of saturated/unsaturated fatty 
acids of cellular membrane may also influen ce capabilities of bioelectricity generation of  
Proteus hauseri ZMd44 as compared to a different species in the Proteus genus (e.g., 
Proteus vulgaris ; Choi et al., 2003). 
 Simultaneous Dye Decolorization and Current Generation. There are several points to 
explain simultaneous color removal and power generation of ZMd44 taking place in MFCs.  
First, Liu et al. (2009) menti oned that azo dye may play a ro le as an electron acceptor in 
cathode. However, azo dye RBu160 apparently c ould not play as an electron acceptor in 
our air-cathode MFC systems, since oxygen wa s inevitably the favorab le electron acceptor. 
Second, Chen (2006) and Chen et al. (2009b) me ntioned that impulse additions of C.I. 
reactive red 141 significantly enhanced cell growth of biodecolorizers Pseudomonas 
luteola and Aeromonas hydrophila  due to stimulating utilizati on to LB growth media. After 
additions of RBu160, similar growth-stimu lating phenomena likel y taking place in P.  
hauseri  may also increase the rate of oxidati ve phosphorylation to ac celerate electron 
transport in the respiratory chain of immob ilized cells on the anodic biofilm for bioelec-
tricity production in MFC. Third, decolorized  products of textile dye and dye itself (e.g., 
methyl blue; Mohan et al. (2008)) may play a role as redox mediator in our MFC. More-
over, extracellular me tabolites of ZMd44 cells can promot e bioelectricity production by 
mediating electron transport (Pham et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008). Compared to ex-
tracellular metabolites of ZM d44 of 12 h culture at dye-free LB culture, fragmentation 
analysis for GC/MS spectrum on extracellular products or intermediates of ZMd44 in MFC 
(data not shown) indicated that  the appearance of signal peak  of m/z 122 suggested that 
C
7H10N2 (i.e., phenyl methanediamine) was the ma jor decolorized intermediate of RBu160 
as the typical fragment of a highly stable C 7H7+ (tropylium ion; m/z 91) was significantly observed (i.e., C NH2 NH2H
m/z 122
C7H10N2m/z 65  C
5H5m/z 77  C
6H5m/z 91
 C7H7 ) and derived m/z peaks  
of 77 (C 6H5+) and 65 (C 5H5+) were also found. Therefore, the decolorized  
intermediates phenyl methanediamine (PM) or /and 5-sulfoanthranilic acid (5-SA) might 
enhance the performance of bi oelectricity generation. Re garding possible mechanisms 
taking place in MFC during dye decolorizati on, there are at least three proposed  
mechanisms to elucidate electron transfer between bacteria and the anode of the  
MFC: (a) membrane-bound redox proteins (e.g., cy tochromes) to transf er electrons to the 
anodic biofilm of MFC; (b) cell-secreting redox mediators (e.g., phenazine, quinones) as 
electron shuttles; and (c) nanow ires (or conductive pili) for exocellular transport of  
electrons. For strain ZMd44, decolorized in termediates of RBu160 (i.e., PM and  
5-SA) might play a role of external mediat ors for electron transfer, when they were  
coupled with NADH oxidation (Roller et al ., 1984; Park and Zeikus, 2000). In addition, 
strain ZMd44 used outer-membrane asso ciated redox proteins  (e.g., cytochromes 
) (C e) ( C 2 - 3 + +→+ Fe Cytochrome Fe Cytochrome  V E  254.0'
0= ) of the respiratory chain 
to mediate electron transport to the anode for current generation. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
High-level additions of diazo  dye RBu160 repressed capabiliti es of bioelectricity gen-
eration of ZMd44 in MFC likely due to the co mpetition of reductive decolorization. This 
first study reported the capability of simultaneous color removal and bioelectricity gen-eration of Proteus hauseri .
