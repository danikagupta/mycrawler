Nanopillars -TiO 2 thin films was obtained on a borosilicate glass substrate with (S1) and with-
out (S2) polyethylene glycol as template. The photocatalytic behaviour of S1 and S2 thin films 
was assessed inthe degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye from aqueous solution under 
batch reactor operations. The thin films were characterized by the SEM, XRD, FTIR and AFM 
analytical methods. BET specific surface area and pore sizes were also obtained. The XRD 
data confirmed that the TiO 2 particles are in its anatase mineral phase. The SEM and AFM 
images indicated the catalyst is composed with nanosized pillars of TiO 2, evenly distributed 
on the surface of the substrate. The BET specific surface area and pore sizes of S1 and S2 
catalyst were found to be 5.217 and 1.420 m2/g and 7.77 and 4.16 nm respectively. The 
photocatalytic degradation of MB was well studied at wide range of physico -chemical pa-
rameters. The effect of solution pH (pH 4.0 to 10.0) and MB initial concentration (1.0 to 10.0 
mg/L) was extensively studied and the effect of several interfering ions, i.e. cadmium nitrate, 
copper sulfate, zinc chloride, sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, glycine, oxalic 
acid and EDTA in the photocatalytic degradation of MB was demonstrated. The maximum 
percent removal of MB was observed at pH 8.0 beyond which it started decreasing and a low 
initial concentration of the pollutant highly favoured the photocatalytic degradation using 
thin films and the presence of several interfering ions diminished the photocatalytic activity 
of thin films to some extent. The overall photocatalytic activity was in the order: S2 > S1 > 
UV. The photocatalytic degradation of MB was followed the pseudo -first-order rate kinetics. 
The mineralization of MB was studied with total organic carbon measurement using the TOC 
(total organic carbon) analysis.

Introduction  
 
The contamination of aquatic ecosystem by a 
variety of dyes posed a serious threat to aquatic 
organisms. Meanwhile, Ca 10,000 kinds of commer-
cial dyes with over 7 x 105 tons of dyes being pro-duced annually,1-4  and about 10 -15% of the dyes 
are being disposed -off to the effluent from dyeing 
operations.5-7 These industrial effluent dyes are 
characterized by high alkalinity, biological oxidation 
demand, chemical oxidation demand and total dis-
solved solids.8 In addition to aesthetic deterioration 82  and eutrophication of water bodies some of the 
dyes, dye precursors, and dye degradation prod-
ucts are reported to be toxic and carcinogenic or 
mutagenic.9 Different methods such as sedimenta-
tion, adsorption, chemical precipitation and some 
biological treatment processes were employed in 
the remediation of such contaminated wastewaters; 
however, they showed some issues related to the 
subsequent environmental concerns or high input 
cost of the treatment process.10 Similarly, it was 
reported that the oxidation of dyes with suitable 
chemical oxidant viz. chlorine, ozone, hydrogen 
peroxide, electro -oxidation or wet -air oxidation 
were found to be inappropriate either due to the 
cost effectiveness or the by -products generated 
caused additional environmental concerns.11,12 Me-
thylene blue (3,7 -bis (dimethylamino) phenothiazin
-5-ium chloride), a thiazine dye (structure 1) is a 
cationic organic dye commonly found in industrial 
wastewater. It is widely used a bacteriologic stain 
and as an indicator.13 Moreover, these dyes are non
-biodegradable and possess relatively high persis-
tency or recalcitrant in soils and aquatic systems.14 
 
Structure 1. Methylene blue.  
  
Advanced oxidation process (AOP) based on 
heterogeneous catalysis employing semiconductor 
TiO 2 photocatalyst is found to be a green and sus-
tainable treatment process for various wastewater 
treatment strategies.15 Under illumination, the 
photo -generated electron -hole pairs (e-/h+) en-
ables the oxidation and reduction of pollutant ad-
sorbed onto the surface of TiO 2. The e- and h+ leads 
to the formation of radical species viz., hydroxyl 
radical (•OH) and peroxide radical (O 2•-). The redox 
potential of •OH radical is relatively very high (Eo = 
2.80 V) which enables efficient oxidation/
degradation of even stable organic compounds/species from aqueous solutions.16 Previously, 
photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue us-
ing TiO 2 powder catalyst was investigated. Results 
showed that maximum degradation was observed 
for TiO 2 powder calcined at 750  °C due to presence 
of anatase and rutile phases in 80:20 ratio. The ac-
tivity of powder calcined at 750  °C was comparable 
with commercial Degussa P -25 TiO 2 powders.17 
Similarly, photocatalytic degradation of various 
types of dyes (alizarin S, crocein orange G, methyl 
red, Congo red, methylene blue) in water by sus-
pension of UV -irradiated TiO2 was studied and re-
sults showed that the degradation followed pseudo
-first order rate kinetics and the initial rates of dis-
appearance was in the order CR> MB > 
AS»OG>MR.18 Continuous effort was made to over-
come the recombination of electron -hole pairs with 
improved visible -light photocatalytic activity of F -
doped TiO 2 (F-TiO 2). Results showed that the F -TiO 2 
exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic performance 
in the degradation of MB which achieved degrada-
tion rate of 91% under visible light irradiation as 
compared with pure TiO 2 (32%).19 
The major problem in the implications of TiO 2 
nanoparticles or nanocomposites is the separation 
of catalyst once operation is completed and hence, 
the further use of catalyst is restricted in successive 
operations. Moreover, the reactivity of photo -
catalyst is greatly hindered with the shadowing 
effect of the semiconductor particles. This further 
suggested the use of a thin layer (film/sheet) of 
TiO 2 immobilized on a variety of supports, e.g. glass 
plates, aluminium sheets etc, could show potential 
applicability as it could be easily recovered and 
reused. Recently, a novel mesoporous hybrid Ag0
(NP)/TiO 2 thin films was used in the degradation of 
tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole. Results showed 
that the template synthesized photocatalyst Ag0
(NP)/TiO 2(B) showed significantly enhanced cata-
lytic activity than the non -template synthesized 
photocatalyst Ag0(NP)/TiO 2(A) and the thin film Ag0
(NP)/TiO 2(B) showed no significant decrease even 
after 6 cycles of successive operations.20 Similarly, 
the degradation of methylene blue dye using 
nanostructured TiO 2 thin film prepared by RF mag-Sci Vis 18 (2) , 81-91 
83  netron sputtering was studied and observed that 
the 40 nm thick nanostructured TiO 2 film exhibits 
highly enhanced photocatalytic activity taking only 
45 mins to complete degradation of 2.1 μM MB in 
water under sun light irradiation.21 Therefore, the 
present communication was intended to immobi-
lized thin films of TiO 2 particles onto a glass sub-
strate using the sol -gel template method and fur-
ther it was employed in the photocatalytic degra-
dation of methylene blue (MB)  dye from aqueous 
solutions.  
 
Materials and Methods  
 
Chemical and materials  
 
The chemicals used for the experiments were of 
AR/GR grade. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide, Poly
(ethylene glycol), methylene blue, were obtained 
from Sigma Aldrich. Co., USA. Acetylacetone, etha-
nol anhydrous, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydrox-
ide, zinc chloride, cupric sulphatepentahydrate, 
cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate, ethylenediamine-
tetraacetic acid, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, ox-
alic acid and glacial acetic acid were obtained from 
Merck India Ltd., India. Sodium chloride and glycine 
were obtained from Himedia, India Ltd., India.  
Stock solution of MB (100.0 mg/L) was prepared 
in purified water. The solution was sonicated for 10 
min to increase the solubility of these pollutants in 
water. Further, the required experimental concen-
tration was obtained by the successive dilution of 
stock solution. The UV -Visible spectrophotometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Model: Evolution 201) 
was used for quantitative determination and to 
study the degradation kinetics of organic com-
pounds by measuring the change in concentration 
at a fixed wavelength of 663 nm. The TOC analyzer 
(Shimadzu, Japan; model: TOC -VCPH/CPN) was 
fully employed to obtain the total organic carbon 
content data for the study of the degradation of 
organic compounds present in water.  
 
 
 Preparation of nano TiO 2 thin films  
 
Nanopillars -TiO 2 thin films S1 (without PEG) and 
S2 (with PEG) were obtained on borosilicate glass 
disk using sol -gel dip coating method with molar 
ratios of these chemicals:  TISP: AcAc: EtOH: AcOH: 
H2O was taken as 1:1.3:40:0.9:12.5, respectively. The 
detailed preparation process was described previ-
ously.22,23 
 
Characterization of thin films  
 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of the TiO 2 thin 
films was collected by X -ray diffraction machine i.e. 
PANalytical, Netherland (model X’Pert PRO MPD) 
and the diffraction data was recorded at the scan 
rate of 0.034 of 2 θ illumination and at an applied 
voltage of 45 kV with a measured current 35 mA. 
The Cu K α radiation was employed having wave-
length of 1.5418 Å. Surface morphology of thin 
films was observed by scanning electron micro-
scope (model FE -SEM SU -70, Hitachi, Japan). 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements 
were carried in the non -contact mode, using XE -
100 apparatus from Park Systems (2011) having 
sharp tips (>8 nm tip radius; PPP -NCHR type from 
NanosensorsTM). The topographical 3D AFM images 
were taken over the area of 10×10 μm2. FT-IR 
(Bruker, Tensor 27, USA by KBR disk method) was 
used to collect the IR data for these thin films. 
Moreover, the BET specific area was obtained using 
the Protech Korea BET surface area Analyzer (model 
ASAP 2020).  
 
Photocatalytic degradation studies  
 
Photocatalytic degradation of MB was carried 
out under batch reactor experimentation. The reac-
tor consists of a black box (dimension: 60 x 45 x 45 
cm). A 150 mL borosilicate glass beaker containing 
50 mL of dye solution was placed and thin film 
(without PEG (S1)) or (with PEG (S2)) was placed 
horizontally at the bottom of the reactor. An UV -C 
lamp of maximum wavelength, λ = 253.7 nm 
(model: Phillips TUV 11W, 4 P.SE; Poland) was Sci Vis 18 (2) , 81-91 84  placed at the top of the reactor at 10 cm above the 
solution. The UV -radiation reached the TiO 2 photo-
catalyst through the dye solution, causing the 
photocatalytic oxidation at the catalyst surface. The 
reaction temperature was maintained at 25±1oC 
using the self -assembled water -bath. Air was bub-
bled to the reactor solution using aquarium air 
pump. The pollutant concentration was analysed 
with a UV -Vis spectrophotometer at certain time 
interval up to 2 h. Initially, blank experiments were 
performed under UV irradiation (photolysis) with-
out TiO 2 photocatalyst for comparison.  
The pH of this solution was maintained by the 
drop wise addition of conc. HCl/NaOH solutions. 
The concentration dependence data was obtained 
varying the MB concentrations respectively from 
1.0 to 10.0 mg/L. The percent efficiency of degra-
dation of MB was calculated with the equation (1):  
   
(1) 
 
 
where, C i and C f are the concentrations of MB be-
fore and after the photocatalytic treatment.  
 
Results and Discussion  
 
Characterization of thin films  
 
XRD data collected for the S1 and S2 samples 
were shown in the Fig. 1 or elsewhere.23 The charac-
teristics peaks obtained for the samples S1 and S2 
at 2θ values of 25.39, 37.84, 48.14, 53.44 and 54.59 
of 25.39, 37.84, 48.14, 53.44 and 54.59 were well 
matched with the standard ICDD (International 
Centre for Diffraction Data) reference pattern and 
are assigned to the TiO 2 anatase phase. The aver-
age particle size of the TiO 2 using Debye –Scherrer 
equation22 for S1 and S2 catalysts were found to be 
25.4 and 21.9 nm, respectively. This further inferred 
that the S1 and S2 comprised with nanosized, pos-
sibly the nanopillars -TiO 2, are evenly distributed on 
the substrate surface.  
Fig. 2 showed The SEM images of S1 and S2 and 
also presented previously.23 It was observed that Figure 2 |  FE-SEM images of the thin films (a) S1; and

AA  
BB  Sci Vis 18 (2) , 81-91 85  the S1 catalyst contained nanosized pillars of TiO 2 
which are aggregated on the solid surface. These 
pillars were very evenly distributed and forming a 
thin film onto the substrate surface with an average 
size of less than 15 nm. On the other hand, the S2 
sample was more disordered with several cracks on 
the surface. The particles of TiO 2 were also, at 
places, aggregated.  
Fig. 3 showed the 3D AFM images of S1 and S2 
were shown in Fig.3 or elsewhere.22 It was obvious 
that S1 is composed with homogeneous distribu-
tion of nanopillars -TiO 2 with optically smooth sur-
face. However, a non -uniform distribution of parti-
cles was seen with S2 catalyst. Further, the average 
height of the pillars was found to be 180 and 40 
nm respectively for the S1 and S2 samples. More-
over, the calculated average roughness (Ra) and 
root mean square roughness (Rq) for S1 and S2 
samples were found to be 3.523, 14.06 nm and 2.708, 4.668 nm, respectively.  
The FT -IR data for S1 and S2 samples were pre-
sented in Fig. 4 or elsewhere.23 The absorption 
spectra of S1 and S2 samples were identical with a 
sharp band at around 3437 cm-1 which was as-
signed to the O -H stretching vibration of Ti -OH. 
The bending vibration of the O -H mode was ob-
tained at around 1638 cm-1. The bands obtained at 
470 and 422 cm−1 were assigned to bending vibra-
tions of Ti –O and Ti –O–Ti of the titanium dioxide 
framework bonds or perhaps the stretching mode 
of Ti-O bond which was enveloped the bonds of Ti -
O-Ti of the tinanium dioxide network.23 While the 
narrow bands at 2922 and 2862 cm-1 were due to 
organic residues.23 
 
The BET specific surface area and pore size of S1 
and S2 catalyst were shown in Table 1. Since the 
Scherrer diameter indicated that the particle di-
ameter is in the order of 21 –29 nm. Therefore, it 
was assumed that a regular network is obtained on 
the substrate surface and, possibly, the titania is 
forming a nanopillars on the substrate with a maxi-
mum size of 30 nm. It was also observed that al-
though the specific surface area of the S2 catalyst 
was less than S1 sample however, the meso -pore 
size was decreased significantly. This enhances the 
possibility of the pollutants to trap within the pores Figure 3 | 3D AFM images of S1 and S2 samples at the

Photocatalytic degradation of MB  
 
Effect of solution pH  
 
The solution pH is an important factor which 
influenced the sorption of pollutants on the catalyst 
surface and hence greatly influenced the photo-
catalytic activity. Therefore, the effect of pH in the 
degradation of MB was conducted over a wide pH 
range, pH 4.0 to 10.0, at a constant MB initial con-
centration (5.0 mg/L). The pH dependence degra-
dation of MB was presented in Fig. 5.  It was ob-
served that the percentage removal of MB in-
creased with increased in solution pH from pH 4.0 
to pH 8.0 and then it stared decreasing up to pH 
10.0. This inferred that an optimum pH 8.0 could be 
an appropriate pH for better performance of 
photocatalyst. The extent of degradation was af-
fected by the surface charge properties of S1 and 
S2 as well as the speciation of the MB molecule at 
varied solution pH values. It was assumed that TiO 2 
surface remained positively charged in the acidic 
media (pH<6.9) and negatively charged in alkaline 
solutions (pH>6.9) as the point of zero charge for 
S1 and S2 was obtained to 6.9.24 On the other 
hand, the MB molecule is a cationic dye13 which 
carries net positive charge. Therefore, a higher re-
moval of MB at alkaline pH i.e. pH 6 to 8was due to 
an enhanced electrostatic attraction between cati-
onic species of MB with the negatively charged 
catalyst surface and resulting in enhanced sorption 
of the dye molecules on the catalyst surface. How-
ever, beyond pH 8, i.e. at pH 10.0, the percent re-
moval was decreased. At higher Solution pH, the MB molecules predominantly lies in the bulk solu-
tion where the concentration of hydroxyl radicals 
was insignificant22 hence, decreased its percent re-
moval. Moreover, the concentration of hydroxyl 
radicals was decreased at high pH25 which in turn 
decreased the photodegradation of MB.  Similar 
findings were also reported in the degradation of 
methylene blue using TiO 2 nanocrystals supported 
on graphene -like bamboo charcoal.26 
 
Effect of MB concentration  
 
The effect of pollutant concentration was stud-
ied at varied MB concentrations, 1.0 to 10.0 mg/L at 
pH 6.0. The results obtained were represented as 
percent removal of MB as a function of initial MB 
concentration and returned in Fig. 6. The percent 
degradation of MB was increased from 66.67 to 
86.66 % (by S2 sample); from 47.31 to 66.65 % (by 
S1 sample) and from 12.36 to 33.31% (by UV only) 
by decreasing the MB concentration from 10.0 to 
1.0 mg/L, respectively. These results clearly indi-
cated that the thin films S1 and S2 showed signifi-
cantly higher photocatalytic activity compared to 
the UV only irradiated samples in the degradation 
of MB from aqueous solution. Furthermore, the 
PEG template thin film S2 sample had more en-
hanced photocatalytic activity than the S1 samples, 
since more MB molecules were effectively trapped 
inside the small mesopores provided by the cata-
lyst surface, and hence, effectively oxidized by the Table 1 |  BET specific surface area and pore size of S1 
and S2 catalyst.

shielded the penetration of UV light into the pollut-
ant solution, which introduced an inner filter effect 
and the solution became more impermeable for UV
-radiations, which therefore limited the generation 
of active hydroxyl radicals and restricted the photo-
catalytic activity.27 
 
Photocatalytic degradation kinetics of MB  
 
The photo -catalytic degradation kinetics of MB 
was presented graphically in Fig. 7. The change in 
Ct/Co values were taken as a function of time 
‘t’ (where C o is the initial concentration of MB and 
Ct is the concentration of MB). A sharp decreased in 
degradation of MB was observed in presence of 
thin films S1 and S2 after the 2h UV irradiation. At 
the end of 2 h irradiation the C t/Co values were 
found to be 0.21, 0.42 and 0.80 for the S2, S1 and 
photolysis only, respectively. A significant lower 
value of C t/Co obtained using the S2 sample com-
pared to the S1 sample confirmed the affinity of 
the pollutant towards the thin film (S2) surface with 
enhanced photo -catalytic degradation of MB at the 
surface. The kinetics of the MB degradation was 
represented using the known pseudo -first-order 
rate equation (Eq. 2):  
   (2) where, [MB] represents the concentration of dye 
pollutant and k app is the pseudo -first-order rate 
constant. It is obvious that the k app depends on the 
concentration of MB. Integration of Eq. (2) with the 
extreme conditions, i.e., at t = 0 the [MB]=C o. Eq. 
(2) resulted in Eq. (3):  
 
 (3) 
 
Straight lines were drawn between the LN(C o/Ct) 
against time `t`. The results obtained were pre-
sented graphically in Fig. 7 (inset) for the MB 
photocatalytic degradation (initial concentration of 
MB: 5.0 mg/L and pH: 6.0). Moreover, the pseudo -
first-order rate constants were evaluated at differ-
ent concentrations using the UV, S1 and S2 sam-
ples and results were returned in Table 2. It was 
obvious that the apparent pseudo -first-order rate 
constant values were decreasing with increased in 
the concentration of MB. Therefore, the lower initial 
concentration of MB was found to be efficient in 
the photo -catalytic degradation using the thin 
films. On the other hand, UV only showed very slow 
and almost negligible degradation of MB com-
pared with S1 and S2 samples.  
Kinetics of photocatalytic oxidation of MB could 
be fitted with the Langmuir –Hinshelwood (L -H) 
equation which includes the adsorption properties 
of the adsorbate species on the photocatalyst sur-
face. The derived equation (5) is used to its linear 
form:  
 
     (4) 
 
or  
   
   (5) 
 
 
where ‘1/r o’ is the dependent variable, ‘1/C o’ the 
independent variable, 1/k r is the linear coefficient 
and (1/(k r.K)) the angular coefficient of the straight 
line. From this model, the L -H adsorption constant 
and the rate constant were obtained by plotting 1/
ro against 1/C o28 also shown in Fig.8. The results Figure 6 |  Effect of concentration in the photocatalytic

found to be 0.115 and 0.089 (R2: 0.9997; for S1) and 
0.090 and 0.201 (R2: 0.9995; for S2 sample), respec-
tively. The L -H kinetic was reasonably fitted well to 
the photocatalytic degradation of MB using thin 
films.  
 
Effect of interfering ions  
 
The applicability of thin film (S2) in the photo-
catalytic degradation of MB was assessed in pres-
ence of several interfering ions (5.0 mgL−1): EDTA, 
sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, sodium chloride, 
zinc chloride, copper sulfate, cadmium nitrate, gly-cine and oxalic acid and. The sample solution with 
initial MB concentration of 1.0 mg/L was irradiated 
for 2 h at pH 6.0. The percent removal of MB was 
presented as a function of interfering ions and re-
turned in Fig. 9. It was observed that the degrada-
tion of MB was hampered to a varied extent in the 
presence of different interfering ions. The inhibition 
caused by the co -existing ions in the reaction me-
dium was mainly due to the scavenger properties 
of the cations or anions, as the photocatalytic deg-
radation processes were predominantly driven by 
the highly oxidizing species, photogenerated va-
lence band holes (h+) or hydroxyl radicals (•OH).  
Mineralization of MB  
 
The mineralization of MB was studied varying 
the pollutant concentration from 1.0 to 10.0 mg/L 
at constant pH 6.0 using S1 and S2 photocatalyst. 
Results were obtained at the end of 2 h of photo -
irradiation. Percent of TOC removal as a function of 
MB concentration was shown in Fig. 10. The results 
showed that increasing the concentration of MB 
from 1.0 to 10.0 mg/L the percent of TOC removal 
was decreased from 51.30 to 15.78 % (using S2 thin 
films) and 32.61 to 3.60% (using S1thin films). How-
ever, prolonged irradiation, 24 h using S2 photo-
catalyst enabled to increase the TOC removal even 
up to 87.54 %. These results indicated that a partial 
mineralization of MB was achieved using the thin 
films; however, prolonged treatment may provide a Figure 7 |  Photocatalytic degradation of methylene

tions. The low percent TOC removal rendered rela-
tively a higher stability of the dye molecule with 
large aromatic ring structure as well as the interme-
diates formed after partial degradation in the 
photocatalytic reaction.  
 
Conclusion  
 
The Nanopillars -TiO 2 photocatalysts were ob-
tained on the borosilicate glass substrate using the 
sol-gel template method with (S1) and without (S2) 
PEG (polyethylene glycol) as filler media. The thin 
films were well characterized with the XRD, SEM, 
AFM, FTIR and BET analytical methods. XRD data 
revealed that the S1 and S2 sample consist of ana-
tase phase of TiO 2. SEM images showed fine grains 
of TiO 2 were evenly distributed on the substrate and forming a uniform thin layer of TiO 2 particles 
for S1 sample. Whereas S2 sample possessed rela-
tively disordered surface structure which has sev-
eral micro -cracks on the surface. The IR data indi-
cated the presence of –OH group with both the 
catalyst samples. AFM analytical data showed that 
the mean pillar size of TiO 2 particles was Ca 180 
and 40 nm respectively for the S1 and S2 samples. 
Moreover, the average roughness (Ra) and root 
mean square roughness (Rq) were found to be 
3.523, 14.06 nm and 2.708, 4.668 nm, respectively 
for S1 and S2 samples. Similarly, BET surface area 
for the S1 and S2 thin films were found to be 5.217 
and 1.420 m2/g, with the pore size 7.77 and 4.16 
nm, respectively.  
These catalysts were further efficiently em-
ployed in the photocatalytic degradation of a me-
thylene blue dye from aqueous solutions. Rela-
tively, very high degradation occurred at pH 8.0, 
which was slightly decreased at higher pH condi-
tions. Low MB initial concentration favored greatly 
the efficiency of photocatalyst in the percent deg-
radation of MB. The degradation process was dem-
onstrated with a pseudo -first-order rate kinetics 
and the data was fitted reasonably well with the 
Langmuir -Hinselwood rate Kinetics. The presence 
of several cations and anions hampered to some 
extent the photo -catalytic degradation of MB using 
the S2 photocatalyst. Overall the S1 and S2 thin 
films showed very high percent degradation of MB 
compared to the photolysis. S2 showed relatively 
higher photocatalytic efficiency compared to the S1 Figure 10 |  Percent TOC removal as a function of MB

dye increased with decreasing the pollutant con-
centration. The study conducted employing the 
thin films provide additional advantages with easy 
separation of catalyst as well as diminishing the 
shadowing effects commonly occurred with the 
TiO 2 powder or granules which enabled the S1 and 
S2 thin films to be potential and cost effective 
photocatalyst and could possess greater practical 
or industrial applicability.
