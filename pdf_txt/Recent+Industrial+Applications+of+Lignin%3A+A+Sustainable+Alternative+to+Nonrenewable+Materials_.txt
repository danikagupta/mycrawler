INTRODUCTION
Degradation of polymeric materials is a commonly encountered phenomenon that leads 
to changes on their chemical, physical and mechanical properties. Th  ere are many factors 
causing polymer degradation: solar light or other light energy radiations, heating, chemicals attack, stress loading, water absorption, biological sources and so forth (Allen and Edge 1992). Generally, free radical character of degradation is considered for very frequent mode. Th  erefore

Nowadays, new criteria for chemicals are required such as environmental friendliness, nontoxicity, economical accessibility, and desirable waste disposal. Lignins are three-dimensional amorphous natural phenolic polymers with predominantly hydroxyl, methoxyl and carbonyl substitutions. Th  ey occur in higher plants, mainly in woody 
tissues (20–30 wt %). Lignins are predominantly obtained in larger amounts as by-products of pulp production during delignifi  cation. Most lignin by-products in the pulping industry 
are used as fuel, and only about 2 wt % is utilized in any other way (Lora and Glasser 2002). Technical lignins can be used in engineering plastics, in phenolformaldehyde resins, and in polyuretane fi  lms (Saraf and Glasser 1984). In our previous studies, lignin was used for the

preparation of pulping additives (Košíková et al. 1993) and biodegradable tensides (Košíková 
et al. 2000). 
It is known that lignin,s hindered phenolic hydroxyl groups enable to act as stabilizer of 
reactions induced by oxygen and its radical species. Lignin ability to scavenge the radicals responsible for the oxidation is infl  uenced by limited diff  usion into polymer matrix. It was 
revealed that the antioxidant activity of lignins varies with their genetic origin, isolation methods, and molecular characteristics (Pouteau et al. 2003) Even from the one type of lignin, e.g. kraft lignin, fractions with diff  erent antioxidant activity were prepared. In our previous 
work (Košíková et al. 2001) the infl  uence of lignin (10, 20 and 30 wt %) on rheological and 
strength properties of polypropylene composites was examined. It was revealed that with increasing lignin content the mechanical properties of these composites deteriorated.
With the rapid developments of polymeric materials, there is growing interest in 
understanding the thermal stability and degradation behaviour of polyolefi  ns. Th  us, the 
objective of our research was the characterization of the antioxidative behaviour of lignin biopolymers as natural antioxidants in polypropylene fi  lms containing 0.5-5 wt % lignin and the comparison their eff  ectiveness with that of synthetic phenolic stabilizer in processing, 
thermo-oxidation and accelerated weathering. Moreover, degradation of lignin-polypropylene fi  lms by yeast microorganisms was examined.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Lignin 1 of average molecular mass 2000 with 19.1 % OCH3 and 4.3 % phenolic OH was 
obtained by fractionation of by-product of beech wood prehydrolysis (170 oC, 1 h). Lignin 2 
of average molecular mass 6800 with 15.2 % OCH3 and 6.5 % phenolic OH was prepared by 
fractionation of kraft lignin precipitated from concentrated spruce kraft liquor. Both lignin samples were prepared in Lignin Laboratory, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava. Th  e commercial isotactic polypropylene (PP) TATREN HPE was suplied 
by Slovnaft, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. 
Polymer blends were prepared by compounding PP powder and lignin in a laboratory size 
Brabender at 200 °C in the presence or absence of 0.15 wt % 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. Th e content of lignin was 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 wt %. Th  en the blends were homogenized in a single 
screw extruder at 200 °C. Th  e extrudates obtained were disintegrated for subsequent injection 
moulding. Films about 50 – 60 μm were molded from the mixture at 200 °C. Tensile strength and elongation data were obtained with an INSTRON tester according to standard STN EN ISO 527-1,3. Th  ermal aging was performed at 100 
oC in an air-circulating oven for 168 h. Th  e 
artifi cially accelerated weathering experiments were carried out by using tester XENOTEST 
450 at 35 °C with 55 % relative humidity for 100, 200 and 400 h according to the STN EN ISO 105 B02 (length of sample 31-35 cm).
Th e yeast treatment of the lignin-polypropylene fi  lms were performed with yeast species 
Geotrichum klebahnii (CCY 74-6-2) and Trichosporon pullulans (CCY 30-1-10) in the absence 
of glucose. Th  ere strains were obtained from the Culture Collection of Yeasts (Institute of 
Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava) and maintained on malt agar at 5 °C. It was cultured in a  medium containing 6.7 g of yeast nitrogen phase (Difco) and lignin-polypropylene fi  lms. Th  e pH was adjusted to 6.5. Incubation took place on a rotary shaker at 
2.7 Hz and 28 °C for 16 days.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In our experiments, two series of PP fi  lms containing 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 wt % lignin 1 (L1) 
and lignin 2 (L2), respectively were prepared in the absence of stabilizer. Th  ese fi  lms were 
compared with lignin-free PP stabilized with commercial stabilizer with respect to mechanical properties. From Tab. 1 it is seen that tensile strength and elongation at break were not signifi  cantly infl  uenced by addition of both types lignins over the range from 0.5 – 2 wt %. Th  e 
fi  lms containing 5 wt % lignin exhibit lower mechanical properties. 
Tab. 1: Mechanical properties of lignin-polypropylene films before and after oven aging 
Further experiments were focused on behaviour of lignin-PP fi  lms during thermo-
oxidative aging and artifi  cially accelerated weathering experiments. Th  e values of mechanical 
properties before and after aging summarized in Tab. 1 show that PP fi  lms containing lignin up to 2 wt % are rather stable towards thermo-oxidation in comparison with lignin-free fi  lms containing the commercial stabilizer. Th  e results obtained prove that both lignins used act as 
an eff  ective antioxidant during thermal treatment of PP fi  lms. 
Th e values summarized in Tab. 2 show that PP fi  lms containing 0.5–2 wt % lignin exhibit 
acceptable mechanical properties in accelerated weathering for exposure time 100 and 200 h. Th e increasing of the exposure time to 400 h leads to signifi  cant decrease of tensile strength 
and elongation at break of the fi  lms containing higher amount of lignin than 1wt % resulting in their destruction (Tab. 3). Sample

Our previous studies concerning the biotransformation of lignin with Geotrichum klebahnii  
and Trichosporon pullulans (Košíková and Sláviková 2004, Sláviková et al. 2002) confi  rm that 
these microorganisms produce ligninolytic enzymes in the cultural medium particularly when lignin was the only carbon source. Th  erefore, these yeast strains were used for biological 
treatment of the prepared lignin-polypropylene fi  lms. Because of measurement of mechanical 
properties off  ers a mean of direct estimation of polymer degradation, the changes of break of 
elongation and tensile strenght of PP fi  lms during treatment with a mixture Geotrichum klebahnii

In contrast to the rigid structure of lignin-free PP fi  lms, mechanical properties of polypropylene 
fi lms containing 2 and 5 wt % lignin were signifi  cantly decreased during biodegradation. Th  e 
followed exposition of the biologically treated fi  lms to artifi  cially accelerated weathering results in 
their total destruction. 
CONCLUSIONS
Th e application of lignin preparations into polyalkylene polymers used in our work is attractive 
due to lignin abundance and renewable nature. Th  e optically transparent homogeneous lignin 
containing PP fi  lms (thickness 50-60 μm) with suffi   cient tensile strengths and elongation at break 
could be obtained by blending of polypropylene with 0.5-5 wt % lignin in the absence of commercial stabilizers. It was revealed that lignin may act an eff  ective stabilizer of polypropylene fi  lms in their 
processing, thermo-oxidative aging and in accelerated weathering for exposure time 100 and 200 h. Th e results obtained by accelerated weathering during 400 h as well as biodegradation with yeast 
microorganisms revealed that the prepared lignin-polypropylene fi  lms are potentially nonpersisting. 
Th e ability of lignin-based antioxidants to protect polymeric materials from oxidative damage 
highlights a new avenue for utilizing lignin waste products from the pulp and paper industry.
