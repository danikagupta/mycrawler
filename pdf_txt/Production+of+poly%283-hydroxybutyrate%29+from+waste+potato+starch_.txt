Life Cycle Assessment ABSTRACT  
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is one of the most well-known biodegradable and biocompatible biopolymers 
produced by prokaryotic microorganisms. It belongs to the family of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), and it has 
gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential as a sustainable alternative to traditional 
petroleum-based plastics. Cupriavidus necator has been identified as a potential producer of PHB for industrial 
applications due to its ability to produce high amounts of the polymer under controlled conditions, using a wide 
range of waste substrates. In this study, the ability of Cupriavidus necator DSM 545 strain to produce PHB was 
tested in a fed-batch strategy providing two different organic substrates. The first is a sugar-based syrup (SBS), 
derived from cereal waste. The second is an acetate-rich medium obtained through CO2 -H2 fermentation by the 
acetogenic bacterium Acetobacterium woodii . The carbon sources were tested to improve the accumulation of PHB 
in the strain. C. necator DSM 545 proved to be able to grow and to perform high accumulation of biopolymer on 
waste substrates containing glucose, fructose, and acetate, reaching about 10 g/L of PHB, 83% of biopolymer 
accumulation in cell dry mass, in 48 h of fed-batch fermentation in 0.6 L working volume in a bioreactor. 
Moreover, a Life Cycle Assessment analysis was performed to evaluate the environmental impact of the process 
converting the sugar syrup alone and the integrated one. It demonstrated that the integrated process is more 
sustainable and that the most impactful step is the PHB production, followed by the polymer extraction.   
1.Introduction 
The awareness of the pollution from the accumulation of plastics into 
the environment led to increasing efforts to tackle this issue by replacing 
traditional polymers with biodegradable ones. Moreover, due to climate 
change, the replacement of fossil materials with alternatives to produce 
polymers is more advisable. Accordingly, biomass is an alternative 
renewable source deeply used to make different kinds of bio-based 
polymers like polylactic acid (PLA) [1] and polyhydroxyalkanoates 
(PHAs) [2,3] . PHAs are polyesters of hydroxyalkanoic acids that share 
several chemicals, physical, thermal, and mechanical features with synthetic petrochemical-based polymers, but they are completely 
biodegradable and biocompatible [4]. PHAs production relies on the 
metabolism of several microorganisms that accumulate it in the form of 
intracellular granules to store carbon and energy during bacterial stress 
conditions such as nitrogen shortage and carbon excess. The granules 
can consist of molecules of 3–5 carbon atoms named short-chain length 
(scl), or 6–14 carbon atoms named medium chain length (mcl). Poly 
(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is composed of a C4 basic unit and is the 
most common and best-studied among PHAs. Even though PHAs are 
very promising environment-friendly materials, their large-scale indus -
trial production still needs to be improved. One of the main criticalities

2is their high production costs. The production expense is estimated to be 
3–4 times higher than polypropylene and polyethylene polymers (about 
2.4–5.5 USD/kg), impairing their industrialization and commercializa -
tion [5,6] . Currently, PHAs production is mainly based on the biocon -
version of refined pure sugars and these sources represent about 40% of 
the total PHAs production cost [7]. Thus, one of the main attempts to 
make the production cheaper is to reduce the impact of the carbon 
sources provided as feedstock for microorganisms. Waste substrates 
such as molasses and cellulosic material have been employed allowing 
valorization of by-products and savings of economic resources leading to 
an improvement in the cost of production and environmental impact 
[8]. Therefore, there is an increasing interest for prokaryotes able to 
accumulate biopolymers valorizing waste products. 
Among PHB producing microorganisms, one of the most studied is 
Cupriavidus necator, formerly also known as Ralstonia eutropha, Wau-
tersia eutropha or Alcaligenes eutrophus [9]. It is a very versatile bacte -
rium, able to grow both autotrophically and heterotrophically [10] and 
perform denitrification in anoxic conditions [11]. This bacterial strain 
can metabolize several organic carbon sources during heterotrophic 
growth, including sugar, fatty acids, amino acids, alcohols, aromatic 
compounds, and TCA cycle intermediates [12]. 
Wild-type C. necator metabolizes fructose as a preferential carbon 
source, and N-acetylglucosamine exclusively via the Entner –Doudoroff 
pathway by its key enzyme 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) 
aldolase (EC 4.1.2.14) [13,14] . In this study, C. necator DSM 545 strain 
was used for its ability also to utilize glucose better than the wild-type 
strain. C. necator DSM 545 owns the constitutive expression of the 
gene coding for the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [15]. 
This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phos -
phogluconate, during which a NADPmolecule is reduced to NADPH, a 
pivotal cofactor for PHB synthesis [16]. For PHB accumulation two 
molecules of acetyl-CoA are condensed by 3-ketothiolase (PhaA) to 
acetoacetyl-CoA. The latter is reduced by the NADPH-dependent ace-
toacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB) to (R) 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA; then 
polymerization to PHB is carried out by the PHA synthase (PhaC). The 
synthesis of PHB can be consistent only if a carbon source is available in 
excess and if one essential nutritional element like N, O, S, Mg, K, or P 
limits cell growth [17]. 
The current study combines two organic carbon by-products for 
C. necator DSM 545 growth and PHB accumulation. Following a strategy 
supporting the circular economy, the first substrate is a syrup from a 
Piedmont cereal factory containing about 50% of glucose and 50% of 
fructose. The second organic carbon soruce is acetate, synthesized 
through carbon dioxide (CO 2) based bacterial fermentation. CO2 is 
abundant as waste from several industrial processes and could be 
recycled as a cheap carbon source [18]. Anaerobic acetogenic bacteria 
synthesize acetic acid reducing CO2 through the Wood –Ljungdahl 
pathway (WLP), using H2 as an electron donor [19]. Due to increasing 
interest in green hydrogen production, several studies on sustainable H2 
production technologies are ongoing [20], so the 
Carbon-Capture-Utilization (CCU) approach is a promising way to pro-
duce acetic acid sustainably [21]. The biological method for acetate 
production allows using a low process temperature (30–37 •C) with 
respect to the thermo-chemical processes, favoring energy cost savings 
[21,22] . Bacterial synthesis also benefits from the high specificity of the 
enzymes involved in the microbial WLP pathway, which usually leads to 
improved acetate yields with respect to other processes [23]. Among 
these bacterial species, Acetobacterium woodii is one of the most studied 
and suitable for this work. It grows heterotrophically on different 
organic carbon substrates [24]. Moreover, it is among the 
best-performing acetogen on the CO2-H2 blend [25]. Acetic acid is the 
main metabolic product, and autotrophic culturing boosts its synthesis. 
In the present work, A. woodii was grown under a CO2-H2 atmosphere in 
a pressurized bioreactor. Performing the fermentation at pressures 
higher than the atmospheric one increases gaseous substrate availability 
in the liquid broth, leading to an increased CO2 conversion by the biocatalyst [26]. The acetate-rich medium (AWM) could be supplied as a 
feed in C. necator DSM 545 cultures for PHB production. 
Eq. 1 shows the first step for indirectly using carbon dioxide to 
accumulate PHB: the H2-mediated reduction of the CO2 into acetate 
performed by acetogenic bacteria [27].  
CO2 4H2 → C2H4O2 2H2O                                                       (1) 
Acetic acid in the AWM is then provided to C. necator . It metabolizes 
the organic substrate to allow both biomass and PHB production, as 
shown in (Eqs. (2) and (3)).  
C2H4O2 0⋅79 O2 0⋅22 NH 4→ 1⋅14 CH1⋅74O0⋅46N0⋅19 1⋅33 H2O 0⋅86 
CO2 0⋅22 H(2)  
1⋅5C2H4O2 0⋅75 O2 → 0⋅5C4H6O2 1⋅5H2O CO2                      (3) 
C. necator can also directly convert H2 and CO2 into PHB in presence 
of oxygen. To allow cell growth avoiding gas starvation, the composition 
ratio of H2:O2:CO2 should be 7:2:1, which might cause an explosive 
atmosphere [28]. According to the mass balance, the indirect conversion 
of CO2 to PHB through acetic acid is an attractive alternative regarding 
safety, CO2 fixation, H2 consumption, and substrate cost [27]. 
Garcia-Gonzalez and colleagues [27] previously assessed the PHA 
production by C. necator DSM 545 cultured with acetic acid in the 
growing medium. Al Rowaihi and coworkers [22] furnished acetic acid 
produced by A.woodii to C. necator grown on pure commercial fructose. 
This study aims to synthesize PHB through C. necator DSM 545 by 
converting a real syrup from a cereal factory and an acetate-rich medium 
from gas fermentation. Thus, the first novelty of the current work relies 
on the design and test of an integrated biorefinery strategy that valorized 
two waste substrates. The sugar syrup was supplied alone or in combi -
nation with acetic acid from CO2-H2 gas fermentation. The latter feed-
stock was synthesized by A.woodii in a pressurized bioreactor with a 
continuous gas supply to avoid gas depletion from the culture medium. 
The second novelty is a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis to compare 
the PHB production through the integrated biorefinery system and real 
syrup alone. The evaluation considered the environmental impacts of 1 
kg of pure PHB production, according to ISO 14040 –44, and relied on 
the parameters applied and results obtained in the current experimental 
work. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. PHB biosynthesis through C. necator fermentation 
2.1.1. C. necator growth media and cultivation in shake flasks 
Cupriavidus necator DSM 545, was obtained from Deutsche Samm -
lung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (Germany). A 
glycerol stock, stored at – 20 •C in 15% v/v glycerol, was cultured in 
0.05 L of Luria –Bertani broth at 30 •C, 200 rpm for 18 h (ES-20/60, 
Orbital Shaker Incubator, Biosan, Latvia) in a flask of 0.250 L total 
volume. LB medium was prepared using 10 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L tryptone 
and 5 g/L yeast extract. Then, 4% of the culture volume was used to 
inoculate 50 mL of a seeding medium at pH 6.8 containing: (NH 4)2SO4 4 
g/L; KH2PO4 1.5 g/L; Na2HPO 4 3.74 g/L; MgSO 4⋅7H2O 0.2 g/L; and 
trace elements solution 10 mL/L [29]. The sugar substrate was a syrup 
with 250 g/L of sugars, mainly glucose, named in this work as 
glucose-based syrup (GBS) (composition: 96.97% glucose, 2.12% 
maltose, 0.62% triose, 0.20% other polysaccharides and 0.1% fructose). 
It was provided by Sedamyl ® company, a Piedmont cereal factory and it 
was used at a final concentration of 10 g/L. 
The trace elements solution contained FeSO 4⋅7H2O 10 g/L, 
ZnSO 4⋅7H2O 2.25 g/L, CuSO 4⋅5H2O 1 g/L, MnSO 4⋅5H2O 0.5 g/L, 
CaCl 2⋅2H2O 2 g/L, Na2B4O7⋅10H 2O 0.23 g/L, (NH 4)6Mo7O24 0.1 g/L, 
HCl 35% 10 mL/L. 
Except for the trace element, MgSO 4 solution and sugars, culture S. Bellini et al.

3media were sterilized by autoclaving. MgSO 4 and trace element solution 
were filtered through a 0.22 µm sterile PES filters. The syrup was pro-
vided ready to use by the company. 
2.1.2. C. necator growth in bioreactor 
C. necator DSM 545 growth in the bioreactor was carried out in a 
Biostat A bioreactor (Sartorius ®, DE) with a total volume of 1.3 L. The 
fermentation medium contained (NH 4)2SO4 3 g/L; KH2PO4 13.3 g/L; 
citric acid 1.87 g/L; MgSO 4⋅7H2O 1.2 g/L; trace element (see Section 
2.1.1 ) 10 mL/L. The feedstock was a demineralized and isomerized 
syrup (SBS) with 280 g/L total sugars (45.6% glucose, 47% fructose and 
the remaining percentage of maltose, triose, and other polysaccharides) 
supplied at a final concentration of 12 g/L. Again, this syrup was pro-
vided by Sedamyl ® as ready to be used. Biostat A bioreactor (Sarto -
rius®) is equipped with a glass vessel. Sterilization of the reactor vessel 
filled with the fermentation medium, without sugars, trace metals and 
magnesium, was done in an autoclave. After autoclaving, the broth was 
completed with SBS, and the filtered solutions of magnesium and trace 
elements. If not otherwise stated, 0.6 L of fermentation medium was 
inoculated with 8 mL of C. necator DSM 545 grown in the seeding me-
dium (see Section 2.1.1 ) to have an initial optical density at 600 nm 
(OD 600 nm) of ≪0.1. 
The head plate of the vessel was fitted with temperature/DO and pH 
probes (EndressHauser). All fermentations were performed providing 
sterile air at 12 L/h rate through a micrometric sparger placed at the 
vessel ’s bottom. The dissolved oxygen (DO) was set at 40% using a 
cascade in the agitation mode, triggered when the dissolved oxygen 
decreased in the bioreactor due to bacterial growth. The agitation was 
carried out using Rushton turbines. pH was controlled at 6.8 by adding 2 
M NaOH. Fermentations were performed at atmospheric pressure. The 
vessel temperature was maintained at 30 •C thanks to an outer thermo- 
blanket. Samples were withdrawn from the reactor at 15, 18, 21, 24, 36, 
40, 45 and 48 h after the inoculation to analyze the content of sugars, 
biomass and PHB. After 15 h of fermentation, a fed-batch strategy 
feeding SBS was conducted to avoid sugar shortages. Sugars consump -
tion was monitored through HPLC. During the fed-batch, feeding was 
conducted manually using a sterile syringe to supply a volume of SBS to 
reach a concentration of sugars in the culture medium of 4, 5, or 6 g/L. 
2.2. Acetate production through gas-fermentation 
2.2.1. A. woodii growth media and cultivation in serum bottles 
Acetobacterium woodii DSM 1030 was obtained from Deutsche 
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DE). The 
medium used for the heterotrophic cultivation in serum bottles con-
tained: KH2PO4 1.76 g/L; K2HPO 4 8.44 g/L; fructose 3.6 g/L; KHCO 3 6 
g/L; NH4Cl 1.0 g/L; NaCl 2.9 g/L; yeast extract 2 g/L; cysteine hydro -
chloride 0.5 g/L; MgSO 4 0.180 g/L; resazurin 1 mg/L; trace element 
solution SL9 1 mL/L; selenite-tungstate solution 1 mL/L; and vitamin 
solution DMSZ 141 2 mL/L. The vitamins solution contained: biotin 
0.002 g/L; folic acid 0.002 g/L; pyridoxine-HCl 0.010 g/L, thiamine- 
HCl ⋅2H2O 0.005 g/L; riboflavin 0.005 g/L; nicotinic acid 0.005 g/L; D- 
Ca-pantothenate 0.005 g/L; vitamin B12 0.0001 g/L; p-Aminobenzoic 
acid 0.005 g/L; lipoic acid 0.005 g/L. The selenite-tungstate solution 
contained: NaOH 0.5 g; Na2SeO 3⋅5H2O 3 mg; Na2WO 4⋅2H2O 4 mg. The 
trace element solution contained: nitrilotriacetic acid 12.8 g/L; FeCl 2≡4 
H2O 2.0 g/L; ZnCl 2 0.070 g/L; MnCl 2⋅4H2O 0.1 g/L; H3BO3 0.006 g/L; 
CoCl 2 ⋅ 6H2O 0.19 g/L; CuCl 2≡2 H2O 0.002 g/L; NiCl 2≡6 H2O 0.024 g/L; 
Na2MoO 4⋅2H2O 0.036 g/L. The trace elements solution, the vitamins 
solution, the selenite-tungstate solution, and the fructose were sterilized 
separately through 0.22 µm PES sterile filters. The other components of 
the medium were sterilized by autoclaving. 
30 mL of sterile heterotrophic medium lacking cysteine were injected 
into a sterile glass bottle (total volume 160 mL) plugged with a rubber 
cap. Each bottle was then gassed with N2. pH was adjusted to 7.2–7.3 
with 100 µL of H2SO4 1.5 M. Subsequently, anaerobic bottles were stored at room temperature for around 24 h. 3 mL of a frozen 10% 
DMSO- stock culture, stored at  80 •C, was used as inoculum. Cultures 
were grown in an orbital shaker (Biosan, LV) at 200 rpm at 30 •C until 
they attained an OD600 nm ≪1. 
2.2.2. A. woodii gas fermentation in bioreactor 
Gas fermentations were conducted in a pressurized custom-adapted 
bioreactor manufactured by the H.E.L company (UK). Details of 
reactor hardware are provided elsewhere [30]. Briefly, it consists of an 
oil-jacketed 2 L stainless steel vessel. Rushton turbines performed the 
stirring at 400 rpm. Pressure, temperature, pH, and redox probes (Sen-
tek, UK) are placed in the head plate of the vessel. A proportional Back 
Pressure Regulation (BPR) valve (Norgren, USA) controls the pressure 
inside the vessel to the stated level. A micrometric sparger placed at the 
vessel ’s bottom allows the sparging of the gas. Mass Flow Controllers 
(MFC) (Vogtlin Instruments, CH; Bronkhorst High-Tech BV, NL) allow 
the control of the in-flow gas rate. The oil jacket controls the tempera -
ture at 30 •C during the fermentation and allows the sterilization of the 
vessel in the preliminary operations and cleaning phase of the fermen -
tation. During the fermentation, pH was controlled at 7 using NaOH 3.5 
M provided through a piston pump (Eldex, USA). 
Growth medium in the bioreactor contained: KH2PO4 0.176 g/L; 
K2HPO 4 0.844 g/L; NH4Cl 1.0 g/L; NaCl 2.9 g/L; yeast extract 2 g/L; 
cysteine hydrochloride 0.5 g/L; MgSO 4 0.180 g/L and resazurin 1 mg/L. 
0.8 L of the medium was loaded into the vessel and sterilized through in 
situ autoclaving. After cooling, trace element solution SL9 1 mL/L, 
selenite-tungstate solution 1 mL/L, and vitamin solution DMSZ 141 2 
mL/L were added. The composition and sterilization methods of trace 
element solution, selenite-tungstate solution, and vitamin solution were 
the same described in Section 2.2.1 . Then, the complete autotrophic 
medium was gassed first with nitrogen, to remove oxygen, and then with 
a 70% H2 and 30% CO2 mix at 4.5 L/h for 3 h at a constant pressure of 
1.5 bar before inoculation [30]. A heterotrophic preculture of A. woodii 
was inoculated such that the starting OD600 nm in the vessel was ≪0.2. 
The gas fermentation was conducted in liquid batch and continuous 
gas supply. The fermentation lasted 169.5 h and was performed by 
augmenting the pressure inside the reactor when the OD600 nm rose. The 
inoculation was performed with slight overpressure (1.1 bar). Further -
more, pressure increase was combined with two in-flow gas rates. The 
following steps in sequence were applied: i) 1.1 bar and 0.6 L/h in-flow 
gas rate; ii) 1.7 bar and 0.6 in-flow gas rate; iii) 2.25 bar and 0.6 L/h in- 
flow gas rate; iv) 2.25 bar and 1.2 L/h in-flow gas rate; v) 2.7 bar 1.2 in- 
flow gas rate, and vi) 3.3 bar 0.6 in-flow gas rate (Fig. 3). During the 
fermentation, samples were withdrawn from the reactor to check the 
performance, measuring OD600 nm and analyzing metabolites through 
HPLC. 
2.3. Fed-batch fermentation using sugars syrup and acetate 
2.3.1. Fermentation on sugars and sodium acetate 
A fermentation using SBS and commercial sodium acetate (Sigma- 
Adrich, USA) was conducted using the same settings parameters 
described in paragraph 2.1.2. As mentioned, the bioreactor was first 
sterilized containing the fermentation medium without sugars, trace 
metals, and magnesium solution. In parallel, a 300 g/L sodium acetate 
solution was sterilized through filtration using 0.22 µm sterile PES fil-
ters. After autoclaving, the cool fermentation medium was com-
plemented with 12 g/L SBS syrup, magnesium solution and trace 
elements as described above (Section 2.1.2 ). After 15 h of fermentation, 
the fed-batch feeding mode started, providing SBS as described in 
paragraph 2.2.2. Moreover, an additional feeding of sodium acetate was 
performed. It started after 24 h of fermentation. The acetate feeding was 
done through a calibrated pump (Sartorius ®), injecting a concentrated 
acetate solution volume such that 2 g/L of acetate were provided in the 
vessel each feeding. Acetate was fed at 30, 33, 39, 42, 44 h. During the 
test, pH was controlled at 6.8 by adding 2 M NaOH. Samples to analyze S. Bellini et al.

4the content of sugars, acetate, biomass and PHB were taken at 15, 18, 21, 
24, 36, 40, 45, and 48 h. 
2.3.2. Fermentation on sugars and acetate-rich waste medium (AWM) from 
gas fermentation 
After A. woodii fermentation, as described in paragraph 2.3.2, the 
broth was collected and stored at  20 •C. Then, the medium was 
centrifuged to discard bacterial cells and filtered through 0.22 µm PES 
sterile filters. The acetate concentration was measured through HPLC, 
and it was 12.5 g/L. Subsequently, the AWM was concentrated using a 
rotavapor (Laborota 4000 – Heidolph Instruments, DE) at 50 mbar, 
40 •C, 150 rpm up to an acetate concentration of 130 g/L. Before 
addition into the fermentation medium for PHB production, the 
concentrated AWM medium (cAWM) was sterilized using 0.22 µm sterile 
PES filters. C. necator experiment for biopolymer production providing 
SBS and cAWM as substrates were conducted in the fed-batch mode 
using the same strategy described in paragraph 2.3.1. 
Also in this case, samples were withdrawn from the reactor to 
measure the content of sugars, acetate, biomass and PHB at 15, 18, 21, 
24, 36, 40, 45 and 48 h. 
2.4. Analytical methods and calculation 
2.4.1. Biomass measurements 
Bacterial growth was estimated by measuring the optical density at 
600 nm (OD 600 nm) using the Jasco V730 STR-773 spectrophotometer 
(Jasco, UK). Distilled water was used as blank and, if needed, samples 
were diluted with distilled water before measurements. 3 mL of culture 
medium was collected at each sampling time and centrifuged at 6931 xg 
for 5 min (CAPPRondo Mini CR1512, CAPP, DK) to evaluate the biomass 
growth (g/L) of C. necator during fermentations. The pellet was washed 
twice with 1 mL of deionized water and centrifuged again at 6931 xg for 
5 min. Then, the wet biomass was dried in an oven (Memmert, DE) at 
90 •C for at least 20 h and weighed. 
2.4.2. Substrates and PHB quantification 
Sugars, acetate, and metabolites (e.g. formic acid) concentration in 
the culture medium were measured through HPLC analysis. Briefly, a 
sample of 3 mL was collected from the reactor and filtered using 0.22 µm 
PES filters into vials for HPLC analysis. To evaluate the amount of PHB 
produced by C. necator DSM 545, the same dried pellet used to estimate 
the cell dry weight (CDW) was hydrolyzed in thermoresistant glass tubes 
using 1 mL of 96% H2SO4. The tubes were placed in a silicon oil bath and 
kept at 90 •C in mixing conditions at 200 rpm for one hour. At the end of 
the reaction, samples were diluted 1000 times, and dilutions were 
analyzed through HPLC, detecting the crotonic acid peak. It is the 
monomer derived from PHB hydrolysis and is used as a reference stan-
dard [31]. 
HPLC analyses were done using a Prominence HPLC System (Shi-
madzu, JP) equipped with a photodiode array detector (PDA) and a 
refractive index detector (RID). Separation of compounds was achieved 
using a ROA-organic acid H(8%) column (Phenomenex) under an 
isocratic flux of 0.7 mL/min of 5 mM of H2SO4 at 50 •C. 
2.4.3. Theory/calculations 
2.4.3.1. PHB content and yield. PHB content was estimated by first 
relating the PHB concentration obtained by HPLC analysis to the 
biomass weight from which the extraction was done. Then, the amount 
was related to the total biomass obtained from that sample.  
Total PHB (g/L) g PHB / volume of sample (L)                                (4) 
The % of PHB content was calculated as:  PHB (%) (g PHB weighted biomass / g weighted biomass) ≡100                     
The g PHB weighted biomass is quantified by HPLC analysis and multi -
plied for the dilution factor of the analyzed sample. 
The yield (YPHB) was calculated as follows:  
YPHB (-) g PHB /g consumed substrate (S)                                              
2.4.3.2. C. necator growth. The growth was estimated by measuring 
OD600nm and drying the samples (CDW) as described in paragraph 2.4.1. 
The maximum growth rate (μmax) was estimated by calculating the ln 
(X/X0) between two sampling points collected at different time (hours) 
during the exponential phase. 
Xbiomass (g/L) of a sample from 15h to 36h of the fermentation. 
X0biomass (g/L) at 0h of the fermentation. 
The logarithmic scale was plotted, and the slope of the linear equa-
tion was obtained to calculate the μ. 
2.5. Environmental evaluation 
Life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed with SimaPro 9.4 soft-
ware and database Ecoinvent 3.8. LCA was performed according to ISO 
14040 –14044 (2006). 
2.5.1. Goal and scope 
The study ’s goal was the environmental comparison of the produc -
tion of 1kg of pure PHB through two processes: the fermentation of the 
real syrup alone and the integrated biorefinery system (paragraphs 2.1.2 
and 2.3.2). The scope of the study was to understand if PHB production 
could be environmentally sustainable at an industrial scale. 
The functional unit (FU) was 1kg of pure PHB since it was the 
product for which the fermentation systems were tailored. In this study, 
the consumed reagents, the required energy, and the produced emis-
sions were referred to the FU. The boundary conditions were depicted in 
Fig. 5, and according to [32] the adopted approach was from gate (bin) 
to cradle. 
The processes described in paragraphs 2.1.2 and 2.3.2 were scaled to 
produce 1kg of pure PHB. 
The sugar-waste substrate, SBS, came from a Piedmont plant, so the 
study was geo-contextualized in Piedmont, a region in the North-West of 
Italy. In accordance with [32] only the direct consequences of PHB 
production were considered, and the environmental impacts of the in-
frastructures were not included, because they were less important to the 
overall results of scenario evaluation. 
The PHB production system included a foreground and background 
system. The foreground system directly involved with the reference 
flow. The background system linked with the foreground system 
included energy production and chemical supply [32]. 
Following the zero-burden assumption, it was assumed that SBS and 
cAWM did not contain any credits related to the impacts produced 
during its previous stages of the life cycle [33] but only the one related to 
the transport to the treatment plant, reported in the Life Cycle Inventory 
(LCI) in paragraph 2.5.2 and in the supplementary materials in a 
detailed form (Tables S1 and S2). 
2.5.2. Life cycle inventory (LCI) 
The LCI defined all inputs and outputs involved in the PHB produc -
tion by fermenting the real syrup alone (Table S1, Supplementary ma-
terials ) and the real syrup plus the acetate-rich medium (Table S2, 
Supplementary materials ). The primary data came from the experi -
mental tests reported in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. For the PHB 
extraction step, evaluation is based on data reported by [31]. Until 2015, 
the most adopted PHB extraction technique was based on halogenated 
organic solvents as chloroform. Nonetheless, it is expensive, environ -
mentally unfriendly, and may cause biopolymer degradation [34]. S. Bellini et al.

5The study of [35] investigated environmentally low impact tech-
niques to recover PHB from C. necator , by testing butyl acetate and ethyl 
acetate to replace the conventional halogenated solvents. The authors 
proved that butyl acetate is a suitable alternative to replace halogenated 
solvents as chloroform to recover PHB. The advantage is that the PHB 
remains in the organic phase, separated from cell debris in the aqueous 
phase. Instead, in the conventional chloroform-based recovery, PHB 
remains in the same phase of the cell debris [35]. 
Table S3 (Supplementary materials ) compares the environmental 
impacts of chloroform and butyl acetate (based on Ecoinvent 3.8 data-
base), proving that butyl acetate is more environmentally friendly than 
chloroform. 
The secondary data were taken from Ecoinvent 3.8. According to 
[36] attributional LCA was applied. In detail, attributional LCA means a 
modeling approach by which inputs and outputs are attributed to the FU 
of a product system, linking the unit processes of the system according to 
a normative rule. The energy required by the equipment was calculated 
according to [37] considering Eq. 5:  
Qsubmsub ≡cp≡(Tin-Treac)                                                                  (5) 
where Qsub is the thermal power required for heating the substrate from 
an inlet temperature of 20•C to incubation and fermentation processes; 
msub is the mass substrate flow rate; Tin and Treac are the inlet and 
incubator/reactor temperatures, respectively, and cp is the specific heat 
capacity. Since fermentation broths could be considered as water, water 
cp is used. 
2.5.3. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) 
Life cycle impact assessment was performed with the ReCiPe 2016 
Midpoint (H) and the cumulative energy demand (CED) methods. The 
analyzed impact category with ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) was climate 
change (kg CO2 eq). It is the indicator of the global warming potential 
(GWP) caused by the emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmo -
sphere. We selected this category to understand the contribution of the 
biorefinery systems studied in the current work to climate variation. 
Moreover, several studies that evaluate this category are available in the 
scientific literature for comparison. Furthermore, the environmental 
impact of each impact category is detailed in Table S4 of supplementary 
materials to provide a general overview of the environmental impact of 
the two investigated processes. 
The non-renewable energy of the CED represents the direct and in-
direct energy used throughout the life cycle, including the energy 
consumed during the extraction, manufacturing, and disposal of the raw 
and auxiliary materials. Biological processes (acetate and PHB produc -
tion) were carried out at low temperatures (around 30–35•C) but for a 
long time (acetate fermentation lasted 169.5 h and PHB synthesis 48h). 
CED method was employed to quantify the impacts related to energy 
consumption of the two production processes. 
Bio-based plastics are completely or partially produced from biomass 
feedstock. Atmospheric CO2 converted into carbon compounds through 
photosynthesis is defined as biogenic carbon in LCA studies. Accord -
ingly, there are two approaches to managing biogenic carbon within 
LCA studies: 1) temporary carbon storage and 2) carbon neutrality [38]. 
Among them, climate neutrality is often assumed, which considers that 
the carbon that is sequestered by the feedstock is released back into the 
environment in a closed loop with no net climate forcing effect. The 
present study adopted carbon neutrality according to [39]. 
2.5.4. Interpretation data and sensitivity analysis 
The last step of LCA is the interpretation of the results to evaluate the 
goal achievement. A sensitivity analysis was performed to measure and 
detect possible variations in the biorefinery systems response to envi-
ronmental impacts. The sensitive analysis was performed by varying the 
PHB yield production ±5% w/w for all the units included in the 
processes. 3.Results and discussion 
3.1. C. necator DSM 545 fed-batch fermentation using sugar-based syrup 
(SBS) as carbon source 
C. necator can metabolize several sugars to produce PHB. Therefore, 
C. necator DSM 545 was tested in a fed-batch fermentation providing the 
sugar syrup SBS as feedstock, containing mainly fructose and glucose. 
During the fermentation, a fed-batch strategy was performed to avoid 
sugar shortage and to achieve the carbon-to- nitrogen ratio suitable for 
PHB synthesis, as described in paragraph 2.1.2. Bacteria growth and the 
PHB accumulation were monitored (Fig. 1), and obtained results were 
compared with literature data. 
C. necator DSM 545 exponential phase started after 12h from the 
beginning of the fermentation, showing a high growth slope from 12 to 
24h, which is also the fermentation phase during which the bacteria 
started to accumulate the biopolymer. 
Total sugars furnished were 35.5 g/L and 34.5 g/L were consumed. 
Thus, 97% of the whole amount of SBS was utilized. The maximum CDW 
achieved was 9.9g/L, and the specific growth rate (μ) was 0.161 h 1. 
7.1g/L PHB were synthesized (Fig. 1), obtaining a PHB yield (g PHB/g 
consumed substrate) of 0.207 gPHB/gcons.subs . The percentage of accu-
mulation (g PHB/g biomass) was 75%. The latter value is consistent with 
the percentage of polymer accumulation reported in the literature for 
experiments performed using the same sugars (Table 1). 
As shown in Table 1, sugar-based waste feedstock has been exten -
sively studied for the growth and PHB production in C. necator . 
The table shows works in which waste-substrates with simple sugars 
were used. They differ in working volumes, feeding strategies, and, in 
some cases, duration. The studies [42,43] , and [44] used broken rice, 
molasses, and red apple waste, respectively. Thus, they valorized 
regional food wastes (Piedmont – Italy), like the current study, that 
valorized the SBS. Other studies using the same strain highlighted dif-
ferences or similarities in yields and percentage of biopolymer accu-
mulation. In the study [40], saccharified potato starch was used to 
achieve a high biomass and PHB concentrations (g/L), in a bioreactor. 
Using a phosphate limiting strategy for 72-hour fermentation, the yield 
of PHB of [40] was similar to the one obtained in the present work. In the 
study [43], molasses were used to accumulate PHB using a nitrogen 
limitation strategy in a working volume of 4L in the bioreactor. In this 
case, the process lasted 48h, and the same strain of the present work was 
used. These studies by Haas et al., 2008 [40] and Dalsasso et al. [43] 
reported a similar content of PHB (%). However, the % of PHB accu-
mulation was lower than the one achieved in the present work, sug-
gesting that either the substrates or the feeding strategies might lead to a 
higher accumulation. In the study [45], the same strain was used, the 
fermentation lasted the same hours (48h), the starvation was induced 
by limiting nitrogen, and a similar accumulation percentage of PHB and 
productivity were achieved, even though the yield of produced PHB over 
consumed substrate was not reported. However, in study [45] the 
fermentation was conducted in flasks (0.150 L working volume), sug-
gesting that the fermentation set up in the present work could be further 
enhanced to achieve higher concentrations of biomass and PHB. The 
works of [41,42] and [44] were conducted in flasks, as well. The studies 
of Brojanigo et al. [42] and Costa et al., 2018 [44] were performed using 
the same C. necator strain of the current work. Both these investigations 
achieved a similar biomass concentration but lower PHB accumulation, 
which could be due to the performing the fermentation in a less 
controlled system than a bioreactor. The presented flask fermentations 
also lasted much longer than the present study (168 h and 96h, 
respectively). The work of Koutinas et al. [41] shows interesting results 
for C. necator DSM 259 fermentations in flasks using wheat hydrolysates 
as carbon sources. A higher biomass and PHB yield were achieved than 
the current study, nonetheless the fermentation process was longer 
(167.5 h). 
The comparisons presented in Table 1 display C. necator capability to S. Bellini et al.

6accumulate high PHB content, underlying the versatility of this strain in 
metabolizing sugar-based waste substrates. 
The differences presented in the reported studies can be due to i) the 
different substrates provided and the availability of their derived simple 
sugars ii) the feeding strategy, iii) PHB accumulation triggering strate -
gies (e.g., nitrogen/phosphorus limitation, dissolved oxygen) during the 
accumulation phase, or iv) the fermentation system used (either flasks or 
bioreactors). Nevertheless, as Table 1 shows, the results obtained in the 
current work are consistent with previous literature data. This result 
engages further studies to valorize SBS as a substrate using C. necator 
DSM 545 for next-generation biopolymer production in a circular 
economy approach. 
3.2. C. necator DSM 545 fed-batch fermentation using sugar-based syrup 
(SBS) and acetate 
After the fed-batch fermentation using only the SBS as substrate, an 
integrated biorefinery system using A. woodii and C. necator DSM 545 as 
biocatalysts was performed. The integrated approach allows the pro-
duction of the biopolymer exploiting the sugar-based waste, as described 
in Section 3.1, and the acetic acid produced through a CO2-H2 gas 
fermentation performed by A. woodii . CO2-based polymers look prom -
ising, as this approach benefits the environment: i) the use of CO2 for the 
manufacturing of bioplastics does not compete with food production or 
soil usage; ii) in an economy approach, CO2 is an abundant source of 
carbon and the ultimate sustainable resource for the plastic industry; iii) 
the indirect use of CO2 could theoretically reduce equal amounts of CO2 (2.84 ton CO2/ton PHB) while consuming 50% less H2 than the 
completely autotrophic production of PHB by C. necator [27]. 
3.2.1. C. necator DSM 545 fed-batch fermentation using SBS and 
commercial acetate 
C. necator DSM 545 was grown on SBS and commercial acetate as an 
additional carbon source. This test was a reference to evaluate the per-
formance of the strain in terms of growth and PHB synthesis using the 
two different carbon sources (Fig. 2). During the fermentation, SBS and 
acetate were separately provided following the fed-batch strategy 
described in Section 2.3.1 . 
The total amount of SBS fed (25g/L sugars) was consumed at the end 
of the experiment. Sodium acetate was provided five times (at 30, 33, 
40, 43, 45h) and was also completely consumed during the fermenta -
tion (Fig. 2 and Fig. 1S in supplementary material ). Results showed a 
lower PHB yield (0.162) with respect to the fermentation providing only 
SBS (see Section 3.1). Nevertheless, the maximum biomass of 11.6 g/L 
and a maximum PHB content of 8.7g/L after 48h was reached, leading 
to the same percentage of PHB accumulation (75%) as providing sugar- 
feed only. Moreover, a slightly higher μ was achieved (0.177 h 1). Thus, 
according to the observed results, adding commercial acetate to SBS 
allowed the achievement of similar performances in terms of bacteria 
growth or PHB accumulation with respect to only SBS fermentation, but 
providing about 30% less sugar feedstock.

7the acetogenic bacterium A. woodii grown in a pressurized bioreactor. It 
was fed with a continuously provided 70% H2 and 30% CO2 blend with 
an in-flow gas rate ranging from 0.6 to 1.2L/h in a liquid batch (Fig. 3). 
To avoid gas-limited growth, the fermentation was performed by 
increasing in-flow gas rate and/or the pressure inside the reactor when 
the OD600nm increased. The process started at 1.1bar pressure and 
finished at 3.3bar. The culture in the reactor reached a maximum 
OD600nm of 1.37 after 121h. Bacteria produced acetate during the 
experiment, reaching a final concentration of 12.5 g/L at the end of the 
process. However, formic acid was synthesized at the higher pressure 
applied (final concentration 3g/L), probably due to an impairment of 
the bacteria metabolism as previously described [26,46] (Fig. 3). 
At the end of the fermentation, the medium was centrifuged to 
separate bacterial cells from the supernatant containing acetate. Then, 
the supernatant was concentrated through a rotavapor and sterilized 
through filtration as described in paragraph 2.3.2. The concentration 
step was needed in order to feed a low volume of acetate-rich broth in 
the fermentation medium of C. necator DSM 545, as described in the 
following section. In the concentrated AWM the acetate reached 130g/L 
while formate 25.7 g/L. 3.2.3. C. necator DSM 545 fed-batch fermentation using SBS and A. woodii 
gas fermentation acetate-rich medium (AWM) 
The concentrate AWM from A. woodii gas fermentation was provided 
as the supplemental acetate feedstock in a fed-batch fermentation using 
SBS as sugar-feed, as previously described for the reference test using 
commercial acetate (Section 3.2.1 ). The fermentation was conducted for 
48h, during which C. necator DSM 545 was cultivated by applying a fed- 
batch strategy with SBS and concentrated AWM separately provided (see 
Section 2.3.2 ). The whole amount of sugar (33g/L) was consumed at 
48h, while half of the furnished acetate was consumed (5g/L). The 
exponential phase lasted about 24h (from 12h to 36h from the 
beginning of the fermentation), during which C. necator started accu-
mulating PHB. The maximum biomass concentration was reached at 
48h and was 12g/L, while the μ was 0.151 h 1. PHB production was 
10g/L after 48h of fermentation, with a biopolymer accumulation of 
83% and a yield equal to 0.270. As described above, A.woodii produced a 
low amount of formic acid besides acetic acid during gas fermentation. 
Thus, also formic acid was transferred into the C. necator medium during 
the fed-batch with cAWM, furnishing 0.38 g/L of formate at each 
feeding (up to 1.9g/L). Nevertheless, unlike acetate, the formic acid 
accumulated in the medium, suggesting that C. necator did not consume 
it. The literature reports that the growth of this bacterium on formate is 
particularly demanding of reducing agents, like H2 [47]. Therefore, it is

8possible that under the process conditions applied, the bacterium pref-
erentially utilized the more easily metabolized substrates (SBS and 
acetate). 
Results obtained in this test showed that C. necator DSM 545 can 
efficiently grow on the SBS and a concentrated acetate-rich culture broth 
from gas fermentation. The utilization of waste fermentation media to 
make value-added products was studied for several applications in 
recent years. To the best of our knowledge, the only other study in which 
acetate from gas fermentation was fed as a carbon feedstock to produce 
PHB by C. necator is the work of Al Rowaihi and coworkers [22]. In that 
study, the CO2 conversion into PHB was achieved in a two-stage bio-
logical process like the one in the current study. Nevertheless, some 
differences in bacteria strains and processes occur. Table 2 details the 
main differences between the two protocols. 
As listed in Table 2, Al Rowaihi and coworkers [22] performed the 
gas fermentation in a pressurized bioreactor up to 2bar but applying a 
gas-fed-batch operative mode. The authors did not report formic acid 
synthesis besides acetate synthesis, as in the present study (Section 
3.2.2 ). This difference could be explained by the different mode of gas 
feeding. A. woodii products ’ spectrum is influenced by the amount of 
dissolved CO2 in the liquid medium. A high concentration of dissolved 
CO2 led to a metabolic impairment and formic acid synthesis in A. woodii 
[48]. Results suggested that the dissolved CO2 concentration in the 
investigation of Al Rowaihi et al. did not overcome the threshold amount 
of carbon dioxide, while the present study did. Nevertheless, in the 
present study A. woodii produced a higher titer of acetate. The PHB cell 
content rose to 83%, achieving 10g/L of PHB and 12g/L of biomass and 
a max growth rate of 0.261 h 1. The percentage of PHB accumulation in 
[22] was lower, suggesting that the feeding strategy and the conditions 
applied in this study improved PHB synthesis. Nonetheless, in [22], the 
AWM concentration step is avoided. This step is energy-consuming. 
Thus, other experiments should be carried out providing a not concen -
trated AMW, like Al Rowaihi and coworkers did, to make the current 
process more energetically sustainable. 
The reported findings demonstrated the potential of utilizing two 
waste streams, SBS and concentrated AWM to make valuable 
bioproducts. 
3.3. Environmental evaluation 
The present section describes the comparison between the environmental evaluation of the PHB production process based on SBS 
alone (Section 3.1) and the integrated bioprocess (Sections 3.2.2 and 
3.2.3 ). The work of [31] was the reference considered for reagents and 
data applied to evaluate the extraction step of PHB production. 
The environmental assessment of 1kg of pure PHB was studied 
through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). 
The two impact categories were climate change (kg CO2 eq./1 kg 
PHB) and fossil energy demand (MJ eq./kg PHB). They were investi -
gated with ReCiPe 2016 MidPoint (H) and cumulative energy demand 
(CED), respectively. As indicated by [49], the analysis detailed these two 
impact categories because they are the most studied in the LCA of bio-
plastic. Thus, considering these parameters, the present study is more 
comparable to other literature studies. Moreover, according to Green 
Deal Europe, energy is the key parameter to evaluate performance and 
system efficiency in the productive processes. The quantification of 
climate change and the emission of CO2 eq. has gained attention due to 
the necessity to achieve carbon neutrality in the productive system by 
2050. 
The investigated processes consisted of four sequential steps: i) the 
pre-culture of C. necator DSM 545; ii) the culture of C. necator DSM 545, 
iii) the fermentation to produce PHB (considering the SBS alone or in 
combination with cAWM as substrates), and iv) the extraction to obtain 
the pure PHB. 
The environmental impacts of the investigated processes are depic -
ted in Fig. 5. Fig. 5, from A to D, displays the integrated processes. Fig. 5 
E – F displays the single-feedstock process. The environmental impacts 
of the process converting SBS alone were 7.19 kg CO2 eq./1 kg PHB 
(Fig. 5E) and 119 MJ eq./1 kg PHB (Fig. 5F). The impacts of the inte-
grated process were 5.05 kg CO2 eq./1 kg PHB (Fig. 5A) and 83.01 MJ 
eq./1 kg PHB (Fig. 5C). 
The global warming potential impact category and the energy con-
sumption achieved a higher impact in the single-feedstock process than 
the integrated one. This is because PHB yield was lower when providing 
the sugar syrup alone than with cAWM. Hence, the process exploiting 
SBS alone required a higher amount of feedstock and reagents. More -
over, a higher fermentation working volume is required for the pre-
culture and fermentation steps. Table S4 in the supplementary materials 
depicts the global overview of all the other impact categories. It shows 
that the integrated process reached a lower environmental emission. 
The outcomes of comparing the two processes led to a focus on the 
integrated one. In particular, bottlenecks were investigated to further 
improve its performance. The global warming potential impact category 
and the energy consumption had the same trend. The process step with 
the highest environmental impact was the PHB production (step iii) 
(3.02 kg CO2 eq./1 kg PHB and 20.98 MJ eq./1 kg PHB) mainly due to 
the addition of cAWM from A. woodii (1.12 kg CO2 eq./1 kg PHB and 
14.50 MJ eq./1 kg PHB), followed by the extraction of PHB (1.81 kg CO2 
eq./1 kg PHB and 39.75 MJ eq./1 kg PHB). 
The process items with the highest environmental impact were re-
agents used for bacteria growth and PHB extraction, followed by AWM 
production by A. woodii , and energy. Each one of these process items 
were analyzed in detail. 
The reagents were necessary to carry out bacteria growth and 
biochemical reactions. Their contribution to non-renewable energy was 
50.09% and in climate change was 52.7% to the total impact of step iii). 
This result is consistent with the study of [50], which proved the impacts 
of nutrients and reagents that constitute the culture broth. 
In the extraction step (step iv) the highest impact was due to the use 
of butyl acetate and acetone in both the investigated impact categories. 
Nevertheless, the impacts were limited due to their recycling and re- 
introduction in the extraction process according to [31]. Butyl acetate 
was chosen as the solvent for this evaluation because it has a higher 
recovery level (96%) and it allows higher product purity (up to 99%) 
than ethyl acetate at 103•C. As shown in [35], this method has a heating 
incubation time of 30min. PHB recorded the highest molecular weight 
of 1.4×106 compared with the standard procedure, which involves Table 2

9chloroform. Therefore, according to the literature, butyl acetate seems 
to be a good alternative to halogenated solvents such as chloroform for 
the recovery of PHB [35]. 
Moreover, employing fossil-based or bio-based reagents can lead to a 
completely different environmental footprint and climate change values 
[51]. The LCA performed by [50] proved that the type of solvent 
employed in extracting products (organic or inorganic solvents) affects the results significantly. 
The second highest impactful item was the production of AWM by 
A. woodii through gas fermentation. It contributed 1.12 kg CO2 eq./1 kg 
PHB and 14.50 MJ eq./1 kg PHB. A focus on A. woodii process was 
depicted in Fig. 5 (B and D). For the acetate from the fermentation with 
A. woodii, the main impacts were due to the reagents in the culture 
medium and for the biochemical conversion of CO2 into acetate (in

10particular H2). They represented 64% in climate change category and 
61% in non-renewable energy to the total impact related to acetate 
production. The energy required by A. woodii fermentation was due to 
the process run time (169.5 h). 
The last highest impactful process item was energy which contrib -
uted 9% to the total impact of the integrated biorefinery, both in climate 
change and non-renewable energy categories. 
One of the findings of the review of [52] is that the impact of 
bio-based products strongly depended on the type of energy source that 
could be used to replace the fossil one in biorefineries and the conver -
sion process of complex feedstock (e.g. rice straw) into high-added value 
products. Several LCA studies evidenced that the environmental impact 
of PHB production can be even higher than that of conventional 
petroleum-based polymers [53,54] . 
The climate change and non-renewable impacts achieved in the 
present study were in line with the ones related to the production of PHB 
from corn sugars which were 3.95 kg CO2 eq./ 1kg of PHB and 79.85 MJ 
eq./ 1kg of PHB [55]. 
The study of [49] produced PHB from glucose using C. necator DSM 
428. The final impact was 1.9kg CO2 eq./ 1kg of PHB, but the down -
stream process was neglected. 
To prove the key role of the feedstock conversion into the target 
product and to validate our study, the sensitivity analysis was performed 
by varying the PHB yield in the production process by 5% w/w. 
The sensitivity analysis confirmed that the most impactful step was 
the PHB production step, and it highlighted that the increase of SBS 
conversion into PHB reduced the environmental impacts of  6.7% 
climate change and  12.4% non-renewable energy. Hence the results of 
our LCA analysis could be considered like the optimized study about 
PHB of [55] and [49]. 
According to the LCA analysis, the integrated bioprocess for PHB 
production is more sustainable than the process that consumes SBS 
alone. Nevertheless, further improvements to the integrated process 
should be made. Concerning the fermentation processes, LCA evaluation 
pointed out that the items with the highest environmental impact were 
reagents used for bacteria growth, the energy demand due to the long 
fermentation process of A. woodii , and AWM concentration. Thus, the 
first challenge should be A. woodii and C. necator media optimization. 
Removing not strictly necessary reagents, considering the impact of this 
removal in terms of bacteria growth and acetate or PHB production 
should be faced. Moreover, the A.woodii gas fermentation could be 
further optimized to shorten the duration. An alternative could be 
exploiting faster microorganisms to reduce CO2 to acetate. As an 
example, the literature describes the thermophilic bacterium Thermoa -
naerobacter kivui as a promising biocatalyst that performs well on CO2: 
H2 blend to produce acetate [56]. Furthermore, tests using the AWM 
without the concentration step should be performed. As 
above-mentioned, this step is energy-consuming: avoiding it will 
improve the sustainability of the process in terms of energy required. 
4.Conclusions 
In this study, we used two different organic substrates for PHB pro-
duction in Cupriavidus necator DMS 545. The two substrates were a 
sugar-based syrup (SBS) from cereal waste and an acetate-rich medium 
(AWM) obtained through CO2-H2 gas fermentation by Acetobacterium 
woodii . The SBS was provided alone or in combination with the AWM, 
reaching a PHB accumulation of 75% and 83%, respectively. 
The sugar syrup was furnished by a local cereal factory. The syrup is 
derived from cereal waste, making it a less expensive resource than pure 
commercial sugars. Moreover, the valorization of local waste allowed 
the application of the circular economy approach. The tested syrup 
resulted in being a suitable carbon source to boost C. necator DSM545 
growth and biopolymer accumulation. 
The acetate-rich medium, obtained through A. woodii gas fermenta -
tion and furnished to C. necator DSM 545, induced a higher growth rate and PHB production than those obtained by providing the sugar syrup 
alone or by adding the commercial acetate. This result suggested that 
acetate, salts and other minerals in the A. woodii culture medium could 
boost the C. necator growth and PHB production. The process parameters 
and results obtained in the experimental campaign were used to eval-
uate the environmental impacts of the PHB production process supply -
ing SBS alone or with cAWM through an LCA analysis. The process with 
SBS alone impacted 7.19 kg CO2 eq./1 kg PHB and 119 MJ eq./1 kg 
PHB, while the integrated biorefinery process impacted 5.05 kg CO2 eq./ 
1kg PHB and 83.01 MJ eq./1 kg PHB. Thus, according to LCA analysis, 
the integrated bioprocess is more sustainable. Nevertheless, the gas 
fermentation performed by A. woodii was one of the most impactful steps 
of the integrated PHB production (1.12 kg CO2 eq./1 kg PHB and 14.50 
MJ eq./1 kg PHB). These outcomes suggest that further improvement 
could be done to reduce the impact of the CCU strategy, and that an 
improved and greener energy storage system could decrease the overall 
impact for each step of the process.
