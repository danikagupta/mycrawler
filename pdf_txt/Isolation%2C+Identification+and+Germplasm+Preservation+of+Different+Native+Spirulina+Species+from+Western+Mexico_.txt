ABSTRACT 
The organic content from urban wastewater is treated with various conventional processes efficiently. However, 
for biological treatment of secondary effluent containing excessive inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, 
microalgae can be used. In this study, algal strains have been collected from locally available natural blooms and 
cultured in a BG-11 medium. Spirulina sp., the blue-green algae, dominant over the other species within the 
natural bloom, is applied in ten different dosages (0.2-2.5 g/L) to the synthetic wastewater with a 3-day hydraulic 
retention time. The removal efficiency of nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate have been observed to be about 60%, 
30%, and 54% respectively. The highest removal efficiency has been found at 2.5 g/L of microalgae dose. Linear 
forms of Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms have been used for biosorption modeling, and both isotherms fit 
well with R2>60% and NRMSE<11% in all cases. Additionally, the separation factor and the adsorption intensity 
represent the favorability of the biosorption process.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Water is a fundamental necessity for life. Every metabolism inside a body depends on water. However, only 2.66% 
of the total water resource is freshwater. For this reason, the conservation of freshwater sources has become a 
priority throughout the world. The qualitative and quantitative threats to water resources have been imposed due 
to man-made pollution. The urban municipal wastewater generally originated from domestic and community uses. 
An urban city having a population of 5,00,000 and water consumption of 0.2 td-1capita-1, produces 85,000 td-1 of 
wastewater approximately(Cai  et al. 2013).The inorganic component of municipal wastewater contributes greatly 
to the accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in receiving water bodies. The source of nitrogen and phosphorus 
in municipal wastewater is various household activities (Abdel-Raouf  et al. 2012).About 30-50% of the 
phosphorus originated from human wastes such as feces, urine, and waste food. The remaining phosphorus content 
(about 50-70%) comes from Detergents which are used for laundering of clothes (Barth  et al. 1976).Initiating 
these pollutants into the environment without proper treatment has a significant negative impact on the aquatic 
ecosystem (Mennaa  et al. 2015).Eutrophication is a common phenomenon causes due to an excess amount of 
nitrogen and phosphorus. Due to eutrophication, the growth of algae and higher forms of plants are accelerated. 
As a result of eutrophication, oxygen depletion and toxic effect occurs in the receiving water body along with 
several adverse ecological impacts and decreased lifespan of aquatic organisms (Henze  et al. 2001). The water 
quality degrades gradually (Commission 2002).The area of surface water polluted with algal bloom is not suitable 
for uses such as drinking, irrigation, industry, recreation, or fishing (Carpenter  et al. 1998).The toxic effect may 
enter into the food chain and causes various kind of diseases to human. 
Aside from the imbalance in the aquatic ecosystem, humans and animals who depend on the water of receiving 
water bodies are facing a greater threat to their health. Exposure to an excess amount of Nitrate may cause gastric 
cancer, impose threats to the newborn child and pregnant ladies, and changes the composition of hemoglobin 
which is responsible for methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome in an infant (Ghafari  et al. 2008, Mayo and 
Hanai 2014). Due to blue baby syndrome, respiratory problems, digestive problems like diarrhea, vomiting, and 
in extreme cases even death in young children may occur. Nitrate also has carcinogenic, teratogenic, and 
mutagenic properties (Abel 2014). Ammonia and Phosphorus donot have any direct effect on humans or animals. 
The necessity of removing them from municipal wastewater is protecting the food chain (Klaassen and Amdur 
2013). 
However, it is very difficult to find a solution for the treatment and safe discharge of wastewater. Since the solution 
involves integrated processes, the technical, economic, and financial issues must be considered. Activate sludge 
process is a very popular conventional method for wastewater treatment. This process shows ahigher removal of 
biodegradable material by using bacteria in primary and secondary treatments of effluent. This apparently clean 20             S. N. Chaitee  et al.                                                 Removal of excessive nitrogen.....................   
                                                                                                            
 secondary treated effluent contains a large number of inorganic compounds, like nitrogen and phosphorus. The 
disposal of a large volume of sludge is also troublesome and may lead to secondary pollution (Olguín 2012). The 
total cost of wastewater treatment increases for each additional step. For removing nitrates, ammonia, and 
phosphate from wastewater completely, a tertiary treatment process costs four times more than the primary 
treatment process. Lastly, the conventional treatment processes lead to incomplete utilization of natural resources 
(Molinos-Senante  et al. 2010, Abdel-Raouf  et al. 2012). 
On the other hand, the capacity of microalgae for inorganic nutrient uptake is very high (Talbot and De la Noüe 
1993, Blier  et al. 1995). Numerous studies have shown that treating the wastewater with microalgae can decrease 
the nutrient concentrations up to 95% (Arbib  et al. 2014, Gao  et al. 2016, Lavrinovičs and Juhna 2017, Wang  et 
al. 2017). Therefore, as a potential alternative, wastewater treatment by using microalgae has been proposed as a 
tertiary treatment process (Olgu ı́n 2003, Sturm and Lamer 2011). Biological removal of nutrients using microalgae 
offers several advantages over tertiary chemical and physicochemical treatments (Proulx and De la Noue 1988, 
De la Noüe and Basseres 1989). Algal treatment is favorable because of the photosynthesis characteristics of 
algae. During photosynthesis, solar energy converts into useful biomasses by combining nutrients such as nitrogen 
and phosphorus and carbon-di-oxide from the environment (Mart ı́nez et al. 2000, Cai  et al. 2013). It is a cost-
effective and environment-friendly method(Pittman  et al. 2011). Microalgae also produce oxygen during the 
photosynthesis process and also have a disinfection effect due to elevated pH (Mart ı́nez et al. 2000). The main 
challenge for this technology lies in the wastewater composition, microalgae species, and the final utilization of 
biomass yield (Jais  et al. 2017). The harvested microalgae can be used for the production of biofuel, fertilizers, 
various high-value products like Pharmaceuticals and genetically engineered products (Mallick 2002, Mennaa  et 
al. 2015). These include antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor/ anticancer, antihistamine, and many other biologically 
valuable products (Borowitzka 2013). Blue-green algae are a prominent form of microalgae within the natural 
bloom in freshwater (Cai  et al. 2013). They are also potential for the removal of inorganic nutrients from 
wastewater. It is also well established that blue-green algae are capable of reducing nitrate, ammonia and 
phosphate (Abdel-Raouf  et al. 2012). 
Nutrients from wastewater are generally uptake by algae for their cellular growth. For the growth of organisms, 
nitrogen is considered a critical nutrient. Within a cell of any organism, organic nitrogen is found in the form of 
biological substances. They are- peptides, proteins, enzymes, chlorophylls, energy transfer molecules (ADP, 
ATP), and genetic materials (RNA, DNA) (Barsanti and Gualtieri 2014). Microalgae convert inorganic nitrogen 
into organic nitrogen by the assimilation process. Eukaryotic algae perform the assimilation process by using 
nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium which are the forms of inorganic nitrogen (Cai  et al. 2013). Inorganic phosphorus 
is also very important for microalgae growth and metabolism. It is found in nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and the 
intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism. Phosphorus also helps to generation of ATP from adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP), accompanied by a form of energy input (Martinez  et al. 1999, Wu  et al. 2012, Beuckels  et al. 
2015, Whitton  et al. 2015). 
The efficiency of microalgae for removing nitrogen and phosphorus content from municipal wastewater has been 
shown in many studies. Chlorella vulgaris  has an efficiency of removing 86% of inorganic nitrogen and 78% of 
inorganic phosphorus (Lau  et al. 1997). About 97.8% of phosphorus is removed from domestic sewage by algae 
(Colak and Kaya 1988, Abdel-Raouf  et al. 2012). Another study shows that Chlorella vulgaris can remove 
ammonia and nitrogen completely from the wastewater. Whereas, the removal rate of phosphate is about 78% 
(Aslan and Kapdan 2006). The strain of Chlorella sorokiniana has shown high efficiency of removing 31-62.2 % 
nitrate, 30.6-39.5 % phosphate,54.1-95.1 % ammonium (Saidu  et al. 2017). About 30-100% of nitrate, ammonia, 
and phosphate can be removed by immobilized Scenedesmus  sp. isolated from municipal wastewater in 21 days 
(Zhang et al. 2008).For Natural bloom,  the efficiency is more than 87% and 80% for removing nitrogen and 
phosphorus respectively (Mennaa  et al. 2015).  Spirulina maxima show the removal of 87% nitrogen and 60% 
phosphorus at HRT of 4 days (Kosaric  et al. 1974). Promising nutrient removal by Spirulina plantensis was also 
confirmed (Lodi  et al. 2003). 
The theory of wastewater treatment with microalgae had established around 50 years ago. In most cases, to ensure 
better wastewater treatment potential, the microalgal strains are chosen considering several criteria. The choice of 
microalgae depends on Wastewater's properties, the required magnitude of treatment efficiency, the cost, and 
energy requirement of biomass harvesting, and the application of the harvested biomass (Al-Jabri  et al. 2021). 
These microalgae strains from any laboratory having a controlled atmosphere need high maintenance throughout 
the operation. Various environmental elements also have a significant impact on them. To minimize these effects, 
using microalgae from natural blooms in local fish ponds is a potential alternative.

 2. METHODOLOGY 
2.1     Natural-Bloom Culture 
Microalgae sample for this study was collected from the natural bloom in pond by the side of university avenue, 
Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet. The collected sample was primarily stored in filtered 
pond water in a 0.5 L plastic bottle.Numerous studies showed that the cell size of microalgae is ranged from 1.75 
µm to 8 µm (Reynolds and Walsby 1975, M  et al. 2013, Taghipour Heidari  et al. 2018). As a result, in this study, 
Grade 2 qualitative filter paper with a pore size of 8 μm was used.  Naturally grown microalgae may arise 
sporadically as water blooms in ponds.  Generally, a large number of these natural blooms are consist of unicellular 
blue-green algae (Geitler 1932). For this reason, the BG-11 cultural medium has been selected to ensure the growth 
of microalgae. Medium BG-11 is neutral after sterilization. It supports the growth of the algal population in the 
air (Stanier  et al. 1971).  The pH of the BG-11 culture medium was maintained at 7.1 by using 1M NaOH. After 
adjusting the pH, the solution was autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min. The medium was cooled before adding the 
collected microalgae sample. The collected microalgae were separated from pond water by filtration. Then the 
filtrate was added to a sterilized BG-11 medium in three 1L beakers. Continuous air supply had maintained by 
using an air pump. A 16:8 hr light:dark cycle was maintained throughout the culture condition. pH had measured 
once a day and maintained as 7.1. 
2.2      Growth Rate Measurement  
A 10 mL sample from each batch has been collected daily at mid-day. Spectrophotometric analyses of the collected 
samples are done by using a UV spectrophotometer. Optical density has been measured from the absorbance of 
680 nm wavelength. The optical density indicates the density of microalgae. Using the optical density (OD 680) the 
growth rate of microalgae is calculated by using the following exponential formula:  
 
Growth rate, GR (per day) =௟௡ை஽೟ି௟௡ை஽ బ
௧,………. (1) 
where OD 0 represents the optical density at the initial day and OD t represents optical density measured at day t 
(Wang et al. 2010). After attaining a satisfactory growth rate after 18 days, the mass culture of microalgae has 
been started. For mass culture, the microalgae were moved from a 1L beaker to a large tank. The dimension of 
the tank is 60 cm × 20 cm. A total 10L BG-11 medium is used for mass culture. 
2.3      Synthetic Wastewater Composition 
Synthetic wastewater is chemically derived wastewater. For determining the chemical composition of the 
synthetic wastewater, wastewater samples have collected from seven random points. They were selected based on 
upstream and downstream of canals, residential areas, and reconnaissance surveys. However, the measured 
nutrient levels of Sylhet municipal wastewater as shown in Table 1 are significantly lower than the standard value. 
According to the environment conservation rules, 1997 the standards of nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate for 
inland water surface of Bangladesh are 10mg/L, 50 mg/L, and 35 mg/L respectively(Rules 1997). As a result, the 
acquired values had compared to those obtained from the literature review (Table 1). The highest values of nitrate, 
ammonia, and phosphate were selected for the chemical content of synthetic wastewater. For the chemical 
composition of synthetic wastewater, the highest nutrient content was selected from Table 1. The concentration 
of the nutrients in synthetic wastewater was set as 17mg/L, 100 mg/L, and 212 mg/L respectively.

 2.4        Experimental Setup 
The experiments with synthetic wastewater were done on a laboratory scale. For each dose, three 1L solutions of 
synthetic wastewater were made. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) for all doses remained constant and it was 
3 days. As a light source, two 23W fluorescent lights were used (Figure 1(a)). The fluorescent lights had 
provided 3600 lumens light intensity continuously for the photosynthesis process. To provide turbulence within 
the wastewater sample, a magnetic stirrer at 350 rpm was used (Figure 1(b)).

and Panel (b) represents the experimental setup of synthetic wastewater treatment. 
2.5     Biosorption Modelling 
Nutrient removal by microalgae is a biosorption process. Biosorption is a physicochemical and metabolically 
independent process. The aim of biosorption modeling is experimental data analyses, understanding process 
mechanisms, prediction of operational condition changes, and optimizing processes (Fomina and Gadd 2014). For 
comparison among different types of biosorbents and their capacities of pollutant uptake, the biosorption process 
can be expressed as an equilibrium isotherm curve (Vijayaraghavan and Yun 2008). For simple single-component 
models, Langmuir and Freundlich’s versions are used widely (Pagnanelli  et al. 2002, Gadd 2009) Biosorption 
modeling helps to develop a design model for the removal of nutrients from wastewater more effectively and 
accurately. For biosorption modelling, Langmuir (Langmuir 1916) and Freundlich (Freundlich 1906) isotherm 
models were used in this study. 
The initial and final concentrations of nutrients are measured using HACH DR 6000 UV- spectrophotometer. All 
HACH products were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Percentage removal for each compound 
was calculated using equation 1 (Moris  et al. 2018).

 3.           RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
3.1         Growth rate and nutrient removal by Spirulina sp.  
The growth rate of microalgae was measured in terms of OD 680. From the growth rate curve, the behavior of 
microalgae in the culture medium can be stated (Figure 3(a)). No lag phase was observed throughout the curve 
which indicated the good adaptation of microalgae in the culture medium. An exponential growth phase had 
observed after 8 days of culture. The exponential growth phase remained for 1 day, and thereafter a comparatively 
stationary growth phase had achieved. 
After reaching the constant growth rate, the collected microalgae had cultured in the glass tank of Figure 1(a) for 
mass production. After two months of culture, the colonies were observed under a microscope and photographed 
with a lens of 40X magnification for taxonomic identification. The dominant algae found in the culture was 
Spirulina sp. (Figure 2). The Spirulina sp . were identified taxonomically according to Ciferri and Tomasseli 
(Ciferri 1983, Tomaselli 1997, Rout 2013).

Removal of nitrate, ammonia and phosphate from municipal wastewater is a vital issue for saving the natural 
water source from pollution. This study was conducted to reducethe maximum amount of nutrient enrichments 
within 3 days of HRT. A total of ten different algal doses i.e. 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, and 2.5 g/L 
were added. Algae were added as a suspension with a ratio of 1:9.5 dry weight (DW) to fresh weight (FW). Figure 
3(b) shows that the maximum reduction in nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate was about 66%, 30%, and 54% 
respectively for 2.5 g/L algal dose. As from Figure 3(a), it can be seen that the algal growth in BG-11 medium for 
the first 5-6 days is very slow and according to another study, algal growth in wastewater is negligible before 5-6 
days (Kothari  et al. 2012). As a result, the algal growth rate was not investigated during the nutrient removal from 
wastewater.

3.2        Calibration results  
Langmuir isotherm model expresses the monolayer adsorption on the adsorbent. The essential characteristic of 
the model is expressed by the dimensionless constant R L. For all three nutrients, the values of R L are within the 
range 0<R L<1 (Table 2). Therefore, the biosorption of the nutrients can be considered as favorable and the values 
of R2 and NRMSE also represent the data are well fitted in the model (see Figure 4(a-b)).

Langmuir model, where Panel (a) includes all three nutrients and Panel (b) represents the magnified section of 
Panel (a). Panel (c) represents Freundlich model. 
Freundlich isotherm model supports the surface heterogeneity. The parameters K F and 1/n from this model express 
the adsorption capacity (L/mg) and adsorption intensity respectively. Figure 4(c) shows the values of R2 and 
NRMSE are around 60-80% and 3-10% respectively which represents the sound goodness of fit of the modeled 
data. The values of 1/n for all nutrients are seen to be greater than unity (Table 2), which symbolizes the increment 
of absorption coefficient with the increment of solution concentration. As a result, hydrophobic surface 
characteristics increase after the monolayer. Again, the value of 1/n within the range of 1-10 expresses the 
favourability of the biosorption for all components.

2. CONCLUSION 
In this study, the BG-11 culture medium is used for the mass production of the collected natural bloom. After 
obtaining the dominant species, the microalgae doses of 0.2 g/L, 0.4 g/L, 0.6 g/L, 0.8 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 1.2 g/L, 1.4 
g/L, 1.6 g/L, 1.8 g/L, 2.0 g/L, and 2.5 g/L are added from mass culture into 1L synthetic wastewater. The hydraulic 
retention time for all algal doses is maintained as 3 days.  
The microalgae Spirulina platensis reduced ammonia nutrients by 82% and phosphate by 65.2% within the time 
period of 48hrs having initial concentrations of  10 mg/L and 5 mg/L respectively (Sofiyah and Suryawan 2021). 
Higher Yields can be obtained by another study with a residence time of 10 days, ammonia removal by Spirulina 
platensis was 97.8% and phosphate has 64.5% reduction  (Kun  et al. 2010). In another study, the Spirulina 
platensis was cultured in a 75% wastewater medium for 20 days. the percent reduction in the level of nitrate, 
phosphate, and ammonium in the medium was 99%, 99%, and 99%, respectively (Can  et al. 2015). In this 
study,the maximum removal of nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate by  Spirulina sp.  are 66%, 30%, and 54% 
respectively which is much lower than the other studies. These results have been obtained for 3-day HRT. The 
maximum nutrient removal has been found at a 2.5 g/L algal dose. 
The feasibility of this biosorption treatment with Spirulina sp. was also confirmed by the Langmuir and Freundlich 
isotherm models. In both cases, the separation factor and the adsorption intensity are below unity. Therefore, not 
only has the favorable adsorption of nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate has established but also well goodness of fit 
of both models have been established by blue-green algae Spirulina sp.  
However, after treating the wastewater with 2.5 g/L algal dose for 3 days, the remaining amount of nitrate, 
ammonia, and phosphate in the synthetic wastewater are 6 mg/L, 70 mg/L, and 97.5 mg/L respectively. The 
amount of remaining nutrients is more than the standard value determined by the environment conservation rules, 
1997 for both ammonia and phosphate. Therefore, a higher algal dose is required to obtain the desired removal 
rate in 3 daysof HRT.
