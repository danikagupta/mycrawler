ABSTRACT
Introduction : Some neurologic conditions that can quickly and with low costs be recognized, classified
and treated thanks to the availability of an EEG recording in an emergency setting. However, although
considered a cheap, not invasive, highly accurate diagnostic investigation, still today, an EEG recording
in emergency, in real time during the event paroxysmal ictal phase, is not yet been become a routine.
Areas covered : This review will cover the role and utility of EEG recording in the emergency setting,
both in emergency department and intensive care unit, in adult and pediatric age, in people admitted
for status epilepticus (convulsive or non-convulsive), paroxysmal non-epileptic events, or other condi-
tions/diseases presenting with mental status changes.
Expert opinion : The prompt recognition of some specific EEG-patterns can permit an immediate and
appropriate therapeutic choice with the resolution of dramatic clinical pictures, which, if not recog-
nized, sometimes could result in severe prognostic events with high mortality or neuropsychiatric
disability. It is important in the next future, to improve the availability of these EEG digital continuous
monitoring, which should be widely used in emergency settings, developing moreover tools and
techniques permitting also review, analysis and EEG-reporting by experts who can work away from
the hospital.ARTICLE HISTORY

1. Introduction
Despite the major technological improvements in neuroima-
ging and laboratory data observed in the last few decades,
electroencephalogram (EEG) remains the hallmark tool for the
evaluation of patients with epileptic seizures or paroxysmal
non-epileptic events, change in mental status and coma, as
well as the assessment of brain death.
The improvement in EEG recording in the last years is also
due to the transition from analogue to technological digital
instrumentation and even more recently to the ability to
record simultaneous video (V-EEG) and to record for pro-
longed periods.
In fact, for many years, EEG meant ‘routine ’EEG, a brief
(20–30 min) recording without video, and, even, in many
Centers, without simultaneously polygraphic recording. Over
the last 20 years, with technological (digital) progress, EEG has
evolved in two major ways: the ability to record simultaneous
video EEG/polygraphy, and the ability to record for prolonged
periods. Thus, somewhat ironically, while the utility of routine
EEG has decreased, the utility of prolonged EEG and V-EEG
have increased and its use expanded rather dramatically [ 1].
Emergency EEG (eEEG) can be required: a) for immediate
performance during non-business hours, performed within
3 hours from the initial request [ 2]; B) for excluding a non-convulsive status epilepticus [ 3]; c) for emergent basis and
performed within one hour [ 4].
However, although EEG is generally considered a highly accu-
rate and cost –effective diagnostic tool in the emergency depart-
ment (ED), obtaining EEG as soon as possible is not yet been
routine in many institutions. Nevertheless, recording a technically
acceptable EEG in electrically hos tile environments, such as an ED,
remains challenging especially wi th uncooperative patients, and
particularly in the pediatric age ( i.e. high line noise in the recorded
signals due to high ambient noise levels, long electrode wires, and
relatively high electrode impedances and inter-electrode impe-
dance differences) [ 5]; also, local access to neurological and EEG
expertise, access to technical p ersonnel and equipment, and local
practice patterns limit the performance of EEG in ED.
Recognition and appropriate diagnosis of conditions such
as seizures, non-epileptic seizures, change in mental status
and brain death) in the ED are essential for immediate and
future management and prognosis [ 6].
We aim to review the usefulness of eEEG and/or V-EEG in
ED highlighting its role in differential diagnosis and predictive
outcome. We evaluated EEG literatures in the emergency clin-
ical setting, considering both EEG and V-EEG. Since, someone
consider continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring a continuum of
eEEG, in this review we also try briefly to consider this aspect.

© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis GroupWe initially focus our attention on four questions that are
frequently addressed in the literature and then we will discuss
the individual clinical conditions in which eEEG is indicated.
1.1. When is indicated emergency EEG?
The application of eEEG recording in ED is still mattered. The
American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recom-
mends EEG in patients with suspect of non-convulsive status
epilepticus or subtle convulsive status epilepticus [ 7]. However
in 1996, a meeting of French experts established a set of
guidelines supporting the usefulness of an eEEG in the emer-
gency setting [ 8]. After this consensus meeting, no further
international consensus with such extensive indications for
an eEEG has been published. Nevertheless, the importance
of an eEEG has been highlighted, both, in adults and pediatric
populations with new-onset seizures and unexplained altered
consciousness. EEG may be very helpful in predicting recur-
rences in patients with new-onset seizures and might also
suggest that the yield of EEG increases with the closer proxi-
mity to the event eEEG further enabled the prompt recogni-
tion and treatment of patients with non-convulsive status
epilepticus that would have gone undetected [ 6]
1.2. Technical difference between EEG monitoring
Different types of electrodes are available: disk or cup electro-
des are classically used, however subdermal needle electrodes
can be applied rapidly and do not require scalp abrasion.
Needles electrodes are not recommended for awake patients
or prolonged recording, but are very useful because of their
rapid positioning and for brief recording in some comatose
patients.
The number of electrodes used in eEEG studies varies con-
siderably. Usually the 10 –20 system places 21 electrodes.
Alternatives to this full montage have been described: –sub-
hairline recording, which uses four bipolar derivations: left
temporal (left anterior temporal electrode to left mastoidelectrode), left frontal (left frontal electrode to left anterior
temporal electrode), right frontal (right frontal electrode to
right anterior temporal electrode) and right temporal (right
frontal anterior temporal electrode to right mastoid elec-
trode); –montage with eight recording electrodes uses four
couples of electrodes: forehead FP1, FP2; central C3, C4; tem-
poral T3, T4; and occipital O1, O2. The reference electrodes
should be at the bilateral earlobe or mastoid levels. The
grounding electrode should be placed at the midpoint of
the frontal pole (FPz), and the common reference electrode
should be placed at the median central point (Cz). However, in
several cases, EEG recording is performed with a reduced
number of electrodes, or in altered positions, in particular
when surgical wounds, ventricular drains, or neuromonitoring
devices limit the available surface of the skull. It is critical
however to maintain the symmetry of the left and right side
electrodes. In long-term EEG monitoring, is sometimes neces-
sary to clean the skin or change the location of some electro-
des to avoid scalp ulceration or infection [ 9].
1.3. There are any differences between children and
adult patients?
The indication for eEEG in children and adults are different
[10]. In pediatrics, the most common indications for EEG are
the evaluation of paroxysmal events, subclinical status epilep-
ticus, investigation of a witnessed first episode concerning for
seizures. The main reasons for ordering an eEEG in adults are
suspected brain death, altered level of consciousness of var-
ious etiology, non-convulsive status epilepticus, subtle status
epilepticus, and follow-up of convulsive status epilepticus,
while evaluation of paroxysmal non-epileptic events, is not
so common as in children [ 5,10].
Based on the available evidence, an EEG has been recom-
mended in all non-provoked seizures in children. In this con-
dition eEEG is more demanding and consuming than routine
one. However an eEEG may be helpfull to avoid improper
treatment as well as hospitalization in intensive care unit,
with less emotional impact on parents too. Although an EEG
obtained early after a seizure (before 24 hours) is more likely
to detect epileptic abnormalities, unilateral slowing after
a seizure can provide lateralizing evidence in patients with
focal seizures. Yet, abnormalities such as postictal slowing can
be transient and should be interpreted with caution in the
context of presentation and time frame after a seizure [ 5,10].
In one series of 111 adults, the eEEG contributed to the
diagnosis in 77.5% of the cases and led to a modification in
treatment in 37.8% [ 11]. In another series of 449 adults who
underwent an EEG within 16 hours of the initial paroxysmal
event, an abnormal result was present in 71% of those
admitted to the hospital and in 59.5% of those who were
discharged from the ED, but the clinical relevance of these
numbers is uncertain [ 12]. In children, the published data are
limited but do suggest a utility for the eEEG. In a series of 32
children, eEEG findings were useful in the decision-making
process in 94% of cases [ 13]. In a series of 56 children, within
a mean follow-up period of 19.5 months, the risk of seizure
recurrence was much higher in those with an abnormal eEEG,Article Highlights
●EEG represents the hallmark tool for the evaluation of patients with
epileptic seizures or other paroxysmal non-epileptic events, change
in mental status, coma and assessment of brain death. An EEG
recording during the event paroxysmal ictal phase, can identify
some neurologic treatable conditions.
●Sometimes, the prompt recognition of specific EEG-patterns can
permit an immediate and appropriate therapeutic choice with
immediate resolution of dramatic specific clinical pictures reducing,
thus, high mortality rate or neuropsychiatric disability.

investigation, an EEG recording in emergency setting is not yet been

●Particularly an ictal EEG recording is mandatory to appropriately
identify and treat the various possible status epilepticus, with crucial
implications particularly in pediatric age.
●In the next future, we must develop tools and techniques permitting
continuous EEG monitoring in emergency setting and ICU, and also
analysis and tele-EEG-reporting by experts who can work away from
the hospital, on demand.2 U. RAUCCI ET AL.and it was estimated that the eEEG contributed to the diag-
nosis in 84% [ 6].
The literature currently reinforces the belief that the avail-
ability of EEG and V-EEG recording in ED is useful, albeit for
different reasons comparing adult and developmental age.
1.4. When is a video-EEG monitoring indicated?
When eEEG is not conclusive, a V-EEG monitoring should be
considered, especially in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), to allow
a differential diagnosis between epileptic and psychogenic
(non-epileptic) seizures, to support the classification of the
electro-clinical syndromes, to take therapeutic decisions [ 14].
The use of prolonged V-EEG recordings ICU setting has
markedly expanded, mostly for the diagnosis and manage-
ment of status epilepticus, especially non-convulsive or
‘subtle ’status epilepticus. As is true in non-ICU setting, the
longer the better, with reasonable limits. The consensus is that
24–48 h of monitoring has the best yield [ 1] (See Table 1 ).
2. Clinical indication for emergency EEG, emergency
video-EEG and subsequent continuous video-EEG
monitoring
2.1. EEG ‘as soon as possible ’after the first seizure
About 8 –10% of the population will experience a seizure dur-
ing their lifetime and about 2 –3% of them go to develop
epilepsy [ 15]. EEG remains an essential diagnostic tool in the
evaluation of seizure disorders. The clinical guidelines from the
American Academy of Neurology for both children [ 16] and
adults [ 17] recommend that an EEG be obtained after a single
unprovoked seizure. Indeed, EEG abnormalities may be useful
in identifying epileptogenic foci, structural abnormalities, and/
or electrographic patterns associated with specific epilepsy
syndromes. However, it is the potential predictive value of
EEG that can have the most prominent role in the evaluation
of a single unprovoked seizure. The literature suggests that
EEG epileptiform abnormalities, after new-onset seizure pre-
dict seizure recurrence. The risk of seizure recurrence is great-
est within the first 1 –2 years (21 –45%) after a singleunprovoked seizure in adults [ 18]. Similarly, in children, the
risk is also greatest within the first 1 –2 years (14 –65%) after
a single seizure. Diagnosis is important because epilepsy is
a treatable condition, with 47% of patients achieving seizure
remission on their first anticonvulsant therapy. It is, however,
important to know that 2.2% of individuals without epilepsy
have been recorded epileptiform discharge on EEG [ 19].
Patients presenting with new-onset seizure who do not com-
pletely recovery within 30 –60 minutes after the end of seizure
should be considered for hospital admission and continuous
EEG-monitoring [ 15]. However as previously discussed routine
cEEG monitoring is possible only in few hospital, so is impor-
tant to perform almost Standard EEG as soon as possible.
Standard EEG after a new –onset seizure is helpful to determi-
nate the likely seizure type (focal or generalized) and to deter-
minate the risk of recurrence after the first event. Patients with
new-onset seizure have 29% of possibility to have epileptiform
abnormalities on their first EEG [ 17] while there does appear
higher if EEG is performed within 24 –48 hours of new onset
seizure [ 20,21]. King et al. [ 22] showed that earlier EEG has
a higher rate of finding epilepsy (51%) than delayed EEG
performance (34%).
Despite is not clear the optimal duration of EEG, perform-
ing a 3 hours Video EEG monitoring, showed that two-thirds of
epileptiform discharges were detected within 30 minutes,
while a 3 hours monitoring is a reasonable option when
a routine EEG fails to detect epileptiform discharges. The
latency to the first epileptiform discharge was shorter for
generalized epilepsy than in patients with focal epilepsy [ 23].
Repeat EEG studies after an initial normal EEG often include
sleep deprivation and or prolonged polysomnographic record-
ing of sleep stages [ 24] because particularly in some idiopathic
epilepsy, the sleep stages can induce/increase both clinical
and EEG epileptic manifestations. In a Dutch study, neurologist
indicated that 48% physicians requested a sleep deprivated
EEG if the initial EEG and brain MRI were normal [ 25]. Routine
sleep deprivation-EEG in a pediatric population increase the
yeld of identifying epileptiform discharges from 56 to
67% [ 26].
2.2. EEG in disorders of consciousness
Altered mental status, a nonspecific manifestation of brain
dysfunction with variable etiology, is a common presentation
in the ED [ 27].
The neurophysiologist does commonly encounter patients
with encephalopathy/delirium (altered consciousness with
impaired cognition, usually with sleep –wake cycle alteration
and lethargy) or coma (an eyes-closed state of unresponsive-
ness) in the hospital setting.
EEG may have a great value in altered mental status
patients, particularly with normal neuroimaging findings [ 28],
although, EEG in the disorder of consciousness is highly sensi-
tive but show low specificity. While neuroimaging such as
Computerized Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) provide anatomical data, EEG is the only readily
available test that provides information about the functional
status of the brain. Assessing the background frequency of theTable 1. Definition of EEG terminologies. See text for more explanation.
Emergency EEG
(eEEG)eEEG has been variably defined as: EEG requested for
immediate performance during non-business hours,
performed within 3 hours from request; EEG done
toexclude various types of ‘non-convulsive status
epilepticus ’; EEG requested on an emergent basis and
performed within one hour
Video-EEG
(VEEG)VEEG refers to EEG recorded for a more or less prolonged
period with simultaneous video recording of the clinical
manifestations
Continuous EEG
(cEEG)cEEG is a gold standard tool in ICU to monitoring NCSE
and subclinical seizures. Almost 24 hours of continuous
EEG monitoring is an appropriate screen for non-
convulsive seizures in comatose and non-comatose
patients. It may also help improve outcomes in patients
in whom NCSE or subclinical seizures are not coexistent
with other serious comorbidities like anoxic brain injury
etc.
Preferelly, cEEG should be associated with video
(VcEEG), if possibleEXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS 3EEG as well as the presence or absence of other features
(reactivity, periodic discharges such as triphasic waves).
EEG can provide insight into the patient ’s underlying con-
dition, increasing or decreasing the probability of specific
altered mental status etiology altered mental status etiologies,
including toxic metabolic, encephalopathy, hepatic or uremic
encephalopathy, encephalitis, and various types of status epi-
lepticus including absence status, focal status, and prolonged
generalized convulsive status [ 29], and in some cases may
provide prognostic information. Also, EEG can differentiate
psychogenic from organic etiologies of altered mental status
patients, and aid in determining whether the pathology is
focal or diffuse [ 11]. Although EEG slowing is a nonspecific
manifestation of cerebral dysfunction, its magnitude correlates
with the functional severity of a clinical encephalopathy, and
its distribution can help distinguish between diffuse, focal, or
multi-focal pathologies. For instance, while transient diffuse
slowing is a common finding after concussion, focal slowing
after head injury indicates cerebral contusion even in the
absence of focal deficits on neurological examination or focal
abnormalities on head CT scan [ 30].
2.3. EEG in status epilepticus
In 2015, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) task
force defined status epilepticus (SE) as ‘a condition resulting
either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for
seizure termination or from the initiation mechanisms, which
lead to abnormally prolonged seizures ’and proposed a new
classification [ 31]. From neurophysiological point of view, is
important to distinguish motor clinical seizure from subtle or
non-convulsive seizure to determinate the usefulness of eEEG
particularly V-EEG, both in adults and pediatrics, considering
the peculiarities age-related.
The two main semiological forms are convulsive SE and
non-convulsive SE (NCSE).
2.4. EEG in convulsive status epilepticus
Convulsive SE is a medical emergency in which intervention
times are critical, they must be early as it is associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. Although EEG monitoring
is not considered essential in the acute diagnosis and treat-
ment of convulsive SE, its use should be promptly considered
to correctly identify a NCSE that may persist even after the
pharmacological control of a generalized convulsive SE. In fact,
‘subtle ’or NCSE should be considered in all patients that
remain comatose after the termination of the convulsive sei-
zure, whenever paralytics condition render the neurologic
examination impossible, and whenever the patient is placed
in a pharmacologically induced comatose state. This consid-
eration is important in that up to 48% of patients in one series
continued to have electrical seizures (subtle SE) on EEG mon-
itoring during the 24-hour period after treatment for general-
ized convulsive SE, despite having no clinical signs of ongoing
convulsions [ 32].
Specific EEG patterns recorded after control of convulsions
were shown to be significantly correlated with prognosis. In
the study by Jaityl et al. [ 33], the presence of periodiclateralizing epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) was a functional
predictor of a high mortality rate, whereas EEG normalization
after convulsive SE was correlated with a good outcome.
Therefore, this indicates that EEG monitoring after clinical
control of generalized convulsion SE serves as a prognostic
indicator, and clinical evidence argues for its availability in
emergency settings [ 34].
Another important challenge for the ED neurology physi-
cian is the diagnosis of focal convulsive SE without impair-
ment of consciousness, defined as a pathological condition
localized to a discrete area of the cerebral cortex. In this
situation, EEG monitoring must diagnose subtle status epilep-
ticus by correlating the onset and persistence of localized ictal
discharges and neuroradiological investigations can be crucial
to identify symptomatic etiologies.
2.5. EEG in non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE)
It is reported that NCSE may be present in more than one third
of patients with persistent, unexplained acute alterations of
consciousness [ 35]. Typical NCSE is Absence Status Epilepticus
in Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy ( Figure 1 ).
Therefore, eEEG is mandatory to perform diagnosis of
NCSE particularly for clinical difficulty of identifying beha-
vioral changes in the absence of a clear tonic and/or clonic
seizure activity. Apart from the wide range of behavioral
manifestations occurring in NCSE that justify the need for
routine EEG availability, NCSE may also include various ictal
morphologies that are difficult to interpret in emergency
settings [ 36]. For this reason studies done in the ED and
the ICU have reported significant delays in the diagnosis of
NCSE, especially when subtle a lterations were attributed to
other etiologies [ 37–39]. To exclude this condition,
a consensus statement of the American Clinical
Neurophysiology Society recommend use of cEEG [ 40], both
in adults and children, after seizures, if impaired conscious-
ness persists after initial treatment; in cases of unexplained
alteration of mental status without known acute brain injury;
when specific EEG patterns are recognized on routine record-
ing, such as, generalized periodic epileptic discharges
(GPEDs), PLEDs, or (bilateral independent periodic epileptic
discharges (BIPEDs); when neuromuscular blocking drugs are
used in high risk patients.
Further, 8 –48% of these patients with convulsive SE will
have also NCSE diagnosed by EEG [ 32,41]. The mortality of
NCSE, which can follow the treatment of generalized convul-
sive SE, can exceed 30% if the seizure lasts more than
one hour [ 42].
Nevertheless, approximately 2% of EDs in the US have EEG
technicians available to obtain tracings and neurophysiolo-
gists to interpret EEG 24 hours a day seven days a week, and
studies have shown that it takes three hours on average to
obtain and interpret an EEG in the ED [ 40]. Earlier recognition
of NCSE, may save lives and costs by diagnosing a previously
unrecognized cause of a patient ’s altered mental status and/or
by avoiding overtreatment of presumed seizures [ 43].
After the introduction of V-EEG monitoring there has been
increased identification of NCSE in lethargic or comatose
patients in ICU. EEG appears mandatory for the diagnosis of4 U. RAUCCI ET AL.NCSE relies largely on EEG findings. because the clinical signs
(if any) are most often subtle, non specific and pleomorphic.
2.6. EEG/video-recording in pediatric age has a crucial
role in differentiating two types of ‘non convulsive status
epilepticus ’(NCSE)
A) Autonomic Status Epilepticus (Panayiotopoulos Syndrome or
‘autonomic epilepsy ’)
B) Confusional Status Epilepticus:
1) with focal confusional NCSE (with more or less significant
impaired awareness)
2) with generalized confusional NCSE (absence epilepsy)
Each of them presents peculiar and different classification
difficulties, to justify as ‘useful or even mandatory ’carrying out
long-term V-EEG recording for diffe rent reasons. In each of these
two types, timely recognition and c orrect classification presents
greater ‘prognostic ’(mainly in focal or generalized confusional
NCSE) or crucial ‘diagnostic ’(mainly in autonomic epilepsy) rele-
vance, to avoid aggressive approach in ‘autonomic epilepsy ’and,
vice versa, on the other side, to i dentify and promptly stop the
‘confusional status epilepticus ’, taking into account the potential
long-term consequences, whose extent has not yet been eluci-
dated by strong scientific evidences. In addition, although a clear-
cut differentiation between ‘focal and generalized confusional
NCSE ’, on a clinical or even EEG-clini cal grounds, is difficult and
sometimes arbitrary, an effort should always be made for differ-
ential diagnosis because classification, prognosis and therapeutic
choices can be very different.
Additionally, all forms, ‘Autonomic (Panayiotopoulos
Syndrome) and Confusional (focal or generalized) ’NCSE, are
peculiar of children or show many considerable different aspects
from the ‘picture presentation ’of the non-convulsive status
epilepticus in Adults (see the previous paragraph): from the
EEG, clinical, epidemiological, etio-physio-pathogenetic and
prognostics points of view; some forms, such as for
Panayiotopoulos Syndrome, are exclusively present in develop-
mental age [ 44]. See Figure 2 for typical Panayiotopoulos seizure.(A) EEG in autonomic seizures and autonomic status epilepticus
in pediatric age: Panayiotopolous syndrome, a peculiar but
common, benign, pediatric, epileptic condition.
Panayiotopoulos syndrome usually occurs in pediatric popula-
tion, during sleep, between 1 and 14 years, but it peaks in
early childhood (between 3 and 6 years) with no apparent sex
or race predilection. Autonomic seizures and autonomic SE are
the hallmarks of the disease [ 45]. Autonomic seizures in
Panayiotopoulos syndrome consist of episodes of altered
autonomic function with emesis as the predominant symptom
[46]. Other autonomic manifestations can be pallor (or, less
often, flushing or cyanosis), mydriasis (or, less often, miosis),
cardiorespiratory and thermoregulatory alterations, inconti-
nence of urine and/or feces, hypersalivation, and modifications
of intestinal motility, rarely ictal syncope or cardiorespiratory
arrest are described [ 47]. The autonomic SE consists of these
prolonged isolated or prevailing subdominant autonomic sei-
zures, lasting more than 30 min or shorter epileptic seizures,
without complete recovery between the seizures (lasting more
than 30 min), characterized by manifestations of the auto-
nomic nervous system associated with loss of consciousness
[48,49]. Panayiotopoulos syndrome is frequent in pediatric
age, the fever is often a trigger and autonomic SE, or second-
ary generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus may rarely
represent the onset of this syndrome requiring, sometimes,
intensive care evaluation [ 45].
EEG studies, usually, describe predominant abnormalities in
the posterior regions [ 45], although EEG recording can show,
focal or diffuse bilateral spreading in extra-occipital regions, or,
even, an onset in central, temporal or anterior regions. The first
description of the Syndrome [ 50] defined this form as benign
occipital epilepsy (early-onset benign childhood occipital epi-
lepsy, or Panayiotopoulos syndrome), precisely because of the
prevalence of EEG discharges in the occipital regions.
Subsequently it was then clarified that the predominant and
most characteristic element of this epilepsy are its autonomic
manifestations, rather than the location of the anomalies, which
Figure 1. Absence status epilepticus.EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS 5does not show any specificity (stressing the multifocality and the
volatility of the interictal spikes and the predominance of the
autonomic symptoms and signs ‘with or without ’occipital symp-
toms); in fact it is now currently classified as ‘Autonomic
Epilepsy ’[46].
The reason why, in this review, the PS is considered an
epilepsy of interest in ED, it can be ascribed precisely to its
high frequency in developmental age, and to its benign evo-
lution, so that the correct classification in children with
Panayiotopoulos syndrome in ED it allows us to avoid mis-
diagnosis and aggressive and inappropriate interventions on
such children who can show confounding clinical pictures, in
terms of the more frequent or challenging differential diag-
nosis (encephalitis, syncope, migraine, cyclic vomiting syn-
drome, motion sickness, sleep disorder, gastroenteritis, or
gastroesophageal reflux) [ 45,47]. This is an idiopathic, benign,
self-limiting, age-related epilepsy, which in most cases does
not require drug therapy.
(B) ‘Confusional Status Epilepticus (CSE) ’in pediatric age :
(1)with focal NCSE
The focal NCSE is rarely reported in children, and it occurs
mainly associated with temporal lobe epilepsy or with other
lesional epilepsies. In the focal NCSE cases, the ictal semiol-
ogy can be represented by speech or behavioral arrest, psy-
chotic, cognitive, emotional, stereotypical automatisms or
sensory manifestations and ev en atonic attacks and erratic
myoclonias, with or without associated autonomic ictal semi-
ology, which, on the other hand, (if present) is clearlydifferent from the ‘autonomic manifestations ’typically pre-
sent in ‘autonomic epilepsy ’or‘Panayiotopoulos Syndrome ’;
in fact, in focal NCSE, if present, the autonomic ictal manifes-
tations are not isolated, nor prolonged ictal manifestation at
the onset, neither prominent and prevalent, compared with
the other associated ictal sympt oms/signs; the EEG anomalies
in focal NCSE are even more different than the clinical ones
(compared with the EEG anomalies in autonomic epilepsy),
showing, in focal NCSE, fast EEG discharges over one or both
temporal lobes and bilateral slow-wave activity, often inter-
mixed with low-voltage fast activity. The interictal EEG in
focal NCSE frequently shows unilateral frontocentral focus
of polymorphic spikes and sl ow waves, which are clearly
different from the cluster of EEG anomalies which can be
observed in idiopathic epilepsies such as the ‘autonomic
epilepsy ’.
These ictal manifestations can be associated with more or
less significant impaired awareness. The availability of an ictal
V-EEG recording and a careful and detailed neurologic exam,
can sometimes be crucial to recognize other possible ‘subtle ’,
subclinical, associated ictal/interictal manifestations.
This form of epilepsy is much more rare and not so benign
compared with the ‘Autonomic Epilepsy ’, and it usually occurs in
the course of temporal lobe or other lesional/cryptogenic epi-
lepsies and the availability of high resolution neuro-radiological
investigations can be decisive for diagnostic purposes. Identify
cryptogenic/lesional epilepsies can be also crucial to start and
choose the most appropriate drug therapy.

by variable degrees of clouding of mental processes, from
simple slowing of ideation to complete unconsciousness asso-
ciated with bilateral discharges of spike-wave-complexes. It
has been variably termed as ‘absence status ’or‘spike-wave
stupor ’or‘petit mal status ’. In 70% of cases ‘absence status
epilepticus ’occurs before the age of 18 years, and most take
place during the first decade. Absence status epilepticus can
be in a minority of children the first manifestation at the onset
of epilepsy (See Figure 1 ).
Considered that the impairment of consciousness can vary
from barely noticeable (which permit the automatic execution
of the acts of everyday life, or even the persistence of higher
cognitive functions), to a severe impairment of consciousness,
it results clear the importance of the EEG recording availability
in ED in order to stop these conditions that rarely may be
marked only by subtle behavioral alterations that last for
weeks or months without even necessarily being recognized.
It is even more evident how important it is to diagnose this
type of epilepsy since they are idiopathic generalized forms,
which require drug therapy but, in most cases, showing an
age-related, drug-responsive, benign prognosis.
2.7. EEG in paroxysmal non-epileptic manifestation
The incidence of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures is high,
between 1.4 and 4 per 100,000 [ 51]. A major subcategory of
these patients presents to ED with pseudo-status epilepticus,
an entity that puts patients at a high risk of iatrogenic harms
comprised of unnecessary intravenous medications and venti-
latory support for airway protection [ 34].
The hallmark of EEG evaluation in non-epileptic manifesta-
tion is about normal background activity during paroxysmal
episode. Then is important also to identify all clinical signs and
symptoms during this clinical manifestation to differentiate
itself from other possible different episodes during his life.
Vital signs are measurements routinely monitored at the
site of a medical emergency by medical professionals andhealth care providers include body temperature, heart rate,
respiration rate, and blood pressure. In recent years, several
investigators have focused on studying changes of heart rate
and other vital signs before, during, and after the seizures
[52,53]. Ictal vital signs extremely fluctuate and thus analysis
of their changes can predict morbidity and mortality in
patients with epileptic seizures and may help in differentiation
between it and recurrent psychogenic non-epileptic attacks or
other paroxysmal events that are frequently misdiagnosed as
epilepsy [ 54]. Usefulness of V-EEG monitoring became
a fundamental step in identifying epileptic seizures, verifying
its type, and to diagnose others spells that mimic epilepsy.
Despite the established role of prolonged V-EEG in diag-
nosing non-epileptic seizure, identification of suggestive fea-
tures is still important for further diagnostic monitoring.
Documenting a negative interictal EEG in the ED might
enhance clinical suspicion and thereby preclude the need for
inpatient monitoring. Thus, in many respects, the ‘certification ’
of a negative EEG might increase the diagnostic yield of other
clinical/historical features in an acute setting where access to
V-EEG is restricted.
It is worth noting that certain types of epileptic seizures,
such as frontal lobe seizures, may be mistakenly diagnosed as
psychogenic [ 34].
2.8. EEG in encephalitis
EEG should be performed routinely as part of the diagnostic
work-up of encephalitis because may provide supportive infor-
mation. Although nonspecific background slowing in most
cases, EEG is a sensitive marker for brain dysfunction and is
abnormal in 87% to 96% of children with encephalitis. Cases of
Herpes simplex encephalitis often have a temporal focus and
may show PLEDs, both proper and plus types (see Figures 3
and 4). PLEDs can also be seen in other disease as well;
however, this is neither a sensitive nor a specific finding for
Herpes Simplex Encephalitis. EEG may also be used to monitor
for seizure activity or to differentiate encephalitis from non-
Figure 3. Periodic Lateralized Epileptiform Discharges (PLEDs proper). PLEDs-proper, in which the periodicity of the discharges is relatively stable, the discharges are
simply configured and uniform, and there are no associated rhythmic discharges.EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS 7convulsive status epilepticus or ‘subtle ’seizures, in patients
who are confused, obtunded, or comatose [ 55].
The EEG may show extreme delta brushes, a finding which
suggests the presence of underlying anti-NMDA receptor ence-
phalitis and temporal slowing and epileptic discharges in limbic
encephalitis [ 56]. In a recent study EEG was helpful in prognos-
ticating the outcome of children with acute encephalitis [ 57].
In a population of adult patients with acute encephalitis,
electrographic seizures were detected in 41% of patients, and
28% met criteria for status epilepticus. Seizures were asso-
ciated with lower serum sodium levels, a higher frequency of
cortical imaging abnormalities, and a number of EEG abnorm-
alities including PLEDs, focal slowing, and generalized delta
activity and low or suppressed voltage [ 58]. Nearly half of the
patients diagnosed with limbic encephalitis have experienced
seizures. Epileptic seizures and facio-brachial dystonia can
precede the appearance of cognitive problems by several
months [ 59,60] in autoimmune encephalitis.Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a slowly pro-
gressive brain disorder caused by mutant measles virus. SSPE
affects younger age groups, characterized by cognitive
decline, periodic myoclonus, gait abnormalities, vision loss,
and ultimately to a vegetative state. EEG shows characteristic
periodic discharges (see Figure 5 ).
EEG abnormalities are observed almost constantly in
NMDA-R encephalitis, but they are usually nonspecific (focal
or diffuse polymorphic slow-waves). However, some particular
patterns that could help to suggest the diagnosis have been
recently described: generalized rhythmic delta activity (GRDA);
excessive beta frequency activity; and their co-occurrence that
gives rises to, a peculiar pattern named ‘extreme delta brush ’,
which is considered highly specific of the disease [ 61]. In
limbic encephalitis, the EEG may show generalized slow-
wave activity even in the absence of onconeural antibodies
but with hyperintensities in bilateral mesial temporal struc-
tures [ 62]. In atypical cases in which MRI can be normal, or

Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE).8 U. RAUCCI ET AL.alternately in which it does show limbic changes but with
atypical clinical features, the EEG can help guide the physician.
The degree of EEG abnormalities has a positive correlation
with the hospitalized stay time, and ICU stay time. An extreme
delta brush pattern in 30% of 23 patients with anti-NMDA
receptors encephalitis, associated with a more prolonged
recovery is previously described [ 63]. The rates of conscious-
ness and movement disorder, and coma increased signifi-
cantly with the degree of EEG abnormalities [ 64].
2.9. EEG in encephalopathy
Encephalopathy is an acute/subacute consciousness disorder
which may result from a variety of causes, including metabolic
(see Figure 6 ), toxic, infective or structural brain dysfunction
[65]. Despite the poor specificity of slow wave EEG, is well
known that selective cortical damage is associated to slowing
of the resting background in the theta frequency, while sub-
cortical white matter damage produces polymorphic delta
activity [ 66].While neuroimaging study can provide information about
structure alteration of the brain, EEG can provide brain func-
tion in patients with disorder of consciousness [ 67].
The sensibility of EEG is demonstrated from functional
imaging studies that showed decrease of cerebral blood flow
in patients with encephalopathy of different etiologies [ 68].
Furthermore, other studies demonstrated that blood-brain
barrier damage, altered neuro-transmissions and inflammatory
cytokines release may also play a role in EEG abnormalities
[68–70].
EEG may be helpful to clinician to classify background
activity, focal o diffuse alteration, reactivity and presence or
absence of other typical features (triphasic waves, intermittent
rhythmic slow activity, periodic discharges), to determinate
the etiologies of encephalopathy or coma and to provide
prognostic information [ 71]. See Figure 7 for diffuse brain
injury and Generalized Periodic Epileptiform Discharges
(GPEDs)
From prognostic point of view Sutter et al. [ 72,73] found
that mixed delta-theta background activity or triphasic waves
had a significantly lower mean GCS than did patients with
Figure 6. Diffuse slow activity in hepatic encephalopathy.
Figure 7. Generalized Periodic Epileptiform Discharges (GPEDs).EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS 9Frontal Intermittent Rhythmic Delta Activity (FIRDA) or theta
background. Although FIRDA can be associated with encepha-
lopathy, this pattern is usually recognized as nonspecific EEG
findings [ 74]
However, in this section it is useful to discuss some peculiar
EEG features in detail.
A) Change background EEG frequency
Beta activity on EEG in patients with disorder of conscious-
ness may be secondary to hyperthyroidism, drug toxicity (ben-
zodiazepine and phenobarbital) alcohol withdrawal,
stimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine, as well as
some antidepressants [ 65,75,76]. Other clinical condition, ran-
ging from mild encephalopathy due to metabolic disorder to
mild cognitive impairment, may induce however a Slow
Posterior Dominant Rhytm [ 76]. With worsening of metabolic
derangements, the EEG can progress to diffuse background
slowing.
(E)Change of EEG activity
Theta slowing of background activity is seen in mild metabolic
or infective encephalopathy and can worsening to FIRDA or
diffuse delta slowing with more severe forms of septic asso-
ciated encephalopathy [ 70]. Elevated theta and decreased
alpha activity are described in patients with Creutzfeldt –
Jakob disease [ 77]. Theta-delta activity was associated with
an unfavorable outcome, especially in intracranial hemorrhage
[65]. Slower delta activity is seen with more severe manifesta-
tions of encephalopathy. Patients with polymorphic delta
activity have large areas of subcortical white matter dysfunc-
tion [ 66] or severe metabolic or infectious derangements [ 70].
Delta EEG may be also associated with posterior reversible
encephalopathy.
(F)Rhytmic EEG pattern
Recent studies have identified FIRDA in a number of more
chronic, structural conditions, hyperglycemia and other meta-
bolic derangements, cortico-basilar degeneration and progres-
sive supranuclear palsy, and Creutzfeldt –Jacob disease [ 76,78–
80]. FIRDA was usually found on faster background activity
and patients were less likely to be admitted to the ICU than
were other patients often having a favorable outcome [ 65,72].
(G)Periodic discharges
Triphasic waves (TWs) are typical feature of some encephalo-
pathy and were most commonly found on a theta-range back-
ground [ 72,73]. TWs are hypothesized to represent an
abnormality in the activity of the underlying thalamo-cortical
network. They are well described in hepatic encephalopathy
but are now known to arise from a variety of etiologies,
including antibiotics, intoxications, brainstem infarction, ster-
oid-responsive encephalopathies, white matter lesions, and
anoxic injury, multi-organ failure. TWs have a dose-
dependent relationship with higher levels of urea and ammo-
nia and are also associated with a higher risk of in-hospital
mortality [ 72,73].Encephalopathic patients often have periodic or rhythmic
discharges other than TWs, which may be thought of as lying
on the ‘ictal –interictal continuum ’. The nature of periodic
pattern can provide some insight into the etiology of the
patient ’s brain injury: PLEDs usually correspond to structural
focal lesion [ 71]. However, metabolic process such as hyper-
glycemia may also rarely trigger PLEDs [ 76].Bilateral indepen-
dent periodic epileptic discharges (BIPEDs) are commonly
reported in infections or anoxic injury, as well as stroke,
tumors, and metabolic disorders [ 81,82]. Generalized periodic
epileptic discharges (GPEDs) are also commonly seen in toxic-
metabolic states or sepsis [ 81,83–85]. Generalized rhythmic
delta activity (GRDA) is frequently seen in brain tumors and
cerebrovascular disease [ 65,86]. Lateralized rhythmic delta
activity (LRDA) is most often found in patients with a focal
cortical injury on the side of the LRDA [ 87]. All the lateralized
or focal periodic patterns are highly associated with seizures,
and one of these patterns on a routine EEG in a patient with
encephalopathy may prompt more prolonged monitoring to
assess for subclinical seizure activity [ 81,85,87].
(H)Sleep features
The presence of sleep architecture on EEG seems to be an
indicator of less severe brain injury and dysfunction. In a study
of encephalopathy of various etiologies, K-complexes were
independently associated with a good outcome in patients
without focal brain lesions [ 73]. Patients with sleep elements
(spindles, vertex waves, K-complexes) on EEG had a better
outcome after brain injury [ 88]. Sleep spindles on EEG have
also been associated with 1-month awakening after coma [ 89].
2.10. EEG in coma
Coma is a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness in which
a person cannot be awakened, which arises when cortical and
brainstem pathways are injured. Patients with coma have
longer intensive care unit stays than do patients without
coma, with more complications and higher mortality [ 71].
EEG is useful in distinguishing coma from other states of
unresponsiveness and has also been used to prognosticate sur-
vival [ 90]. The level of coma may be associated with slowing of
EEG frequency: primarily delta-range EEG in 50% of patients with
GCS of 4. With increasing GCS, patients had faster EEG frequen-
cies, and with GCS of 7 or higher, the majority (80%) had a theta-
range EEG, while none had a delta-range EEG [ 91]. EEG amplitude
is also related to the severity of coma: with more severe meta-
bolic etiologies, the EEG amplitude increases as frequency
decreases [ 84]. However, in comatose or minimally conscious
patients undergoing intensive rehabilitation, lower EEG ampli-
tude predicts a worse recovery [ 92].
EEG patterns are a dynamic finding; any given patient may
progress through several different patterns within a recording
[93]. One study showed that in 10% of post-cardiac arrest
patients, an initially favorable EEG had later deterioration (i.e.
Burst-Suppression pattern, see Figure 8 ), associated with poor
outcome, which is thought to be related to delayed neuronal
damage [ 94].10 U. RAUCCI ET AL.In comatose patients, EEG reactivity to stimulation is also good
prognostic indicator, with reactivity 88.9% specific for predicting
a good outcome in one study of 50 comatose patients [ 95].
(A) Typical EEG pattern
Beta coma is seen in some drug intoxications such as sedatives and
benzodiazepines. Depending on the depth of coma, the background
activity may be reactive or non-reactive. Alpha coma was classified by
Husain et al. [ 96] into three main etiologies: post-anoxic injury, toxic
e n c e p h a l o p a t h i e s ,a n da l p h ac o m af o l l o w i n gab r a i n s t e ms t r o k e( i . e .
locked-in state). In most cases, outcomes are very poor with little
meaningful recovery, particularly if reactivity is absent [ 36,96,97].
However, if a reactive alpha pattern is present following a drug over-
dose, the prognosis is good with over 90% recovering [ 90].
The patient with theta coma are usually clinically stupor-
ous. In these patients if EEG is not reactive outcome is often
poor [ 98]. Similar to alpha coma, a slower, diffuse, unreactive
theta coma pattern can also occur after hypoxic –ischemic
injury, with a poor prognosis [ 99]. Alpha coma may transition
to theta coma, and vice versa [ 93].
Delta coma may be induced by a large disruption of the
subcortical white matter. Traumatic brain injury, metabolic
abnormalities, stroke, and hypoxia are additional common
causes [ 90]. Patients with delta coma activity who survive to
long-term rehabilitation placement have poorer recovery than
do patients with faster frequency EEG patterns [ 92].
Intermittent rhythmic delta activity, which is usually fron-
tally predominant, is a nonspecific pattern that may be seen in
a variety of causes, including metabolic encephalopathies,
increased third ventricle pressure, hemispheric lesions, or
widespread dysfunction of the cortical and subcortical struc-
tures [ 66,96]. Burst suppression or Suppression burst pattern is
commonly seen following severe hypoxic –ischemic injury,
though it may evolve or transition later to alpha or theta
coma, and then to electro-cerebral inactivity [ 93]. Burst sup-
pression may also be seen in late stages of severe sepsis-
associated encephalopathy; it portends a poor prognosis in
this setting also, with high mortality [ 70]. When burst suppres-
sion is a result of drug overdose, good recovery is possi-
ble [ 100].Spindle coma consists of a slow background with frequent
superimposed spindle shaped bursts of 10 –14 Hz activity. Other
features of sleep architecture such as vertex waves or K-complexes
may be present and may be induced by external stimulation
[90,101]. Midbrain injuries are commonly reported causes of spin-
dle coma [ 90,101], but cases following seizure, intoxication, and
hypoxic –ischemic injury are also reported. Patients with post-
traumatic spindle coma often have a good recovery.
(B)Electrocerebral inactivity
Electrocerebral inactivity, consisting of isoelectric (<2 µV), non-
reactive EEG recording or electrocerebral silence, is an indicator
of severe diffuse brain dysfunction. When EEG meets these
criteria and there is a clear etiology without reversible conditions
(i.e. sedating medications, hypotension, hypoxia, hypothermia),
the EEG is consistent with ‘brain death ’. Patients with electro-
cerebral inactivity on EEG all have irreversible coma, with all
patients dying or remaining in a persistent vegetative state [ 96].
2.11. EEG in traumatic brain injury
Standard EEG may help to assess the severity of trauma
shortly after the event (from 10 min to 1 h), but it is not
helpful in assessing subsequent or chronic clinical symp-
toms. Furthermore, within 2 4 hours EEG is often normal
and any focal abnormality tends to disappear within months
or few years; abnormal EEG does not predict clinical impair-
ment and EEG do not always correlate with neurological
findings. The most common EEG patterns found after
a mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) are: attenuated poster-
ior-alpha and focal irregular slow wave activity with
a preponderance of theta waves in the temporal region;
however, minor alpha asymmetry is of dubious diagnostic
value [ 5]. While Liguori et al. [ 102], showed evidence that
the EEG could be correlated with the CT scan findings in
mTBI patients, Oster [ 103] showed that EEG study is not
indicated in these patients and the examination is unreveal-
ing and misleading and may lead to unnecessary diagnostic
procedures.
Figure 8. Burst-Suppression (BS).EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS 11In moderate to severe TBI, with deterioration of clinical con-
ditions, loss of consciousness, drowsiness, amnesia, prolonged
headache and clinical evidence of basal or non-frontal skull
fracture that have been identified as risk factors for a negative
prognosis, the performance of an urgent EEG is mandatory [ 5].
Moreover, it has been demonstrated that in severe TBI EEG corre-
lates well with the depth of post-traumatic coma. Despite a wild
variety of abnormal EEG patterns, including increased slow activity,
amplitude suppression in greater injuries, typical sleep features, epi-
leptic spikes, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, and triphasic
waves, none is pathognomonic of trauma per se [ 5].
The above consequences of severe TBI could be delayed in
emerging and be unnoticed by early cerebral imaging, thus
justifying the need for a continuous neurophysiological moni-
tor, for which EEG is appropriate [ 34].
Epileptic seizures are a common complication of moderate
to severe TBI, with 4 –11% of patients developing clinically
apparent seizures within the first week after injury [ 104].
Between 52% and 100% of the seizures detected may be
subclinical or associated with minimal clinical changes.
Standard EEG often don ’t recognize seizures particularly subtle
or without clinical manifestations (NCSE) [ 105].
In the last years however a potential indication for the use
of EEG monitoring in ICU is progressively increase not only for
detecting epileptiform activity in a predisposed brain, but also
for monitoring impending neuropathological consequences.
The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recom-
mends the use of cEEG monitoring in all patients with
a GCS<8, and the Neurocritical Care Society recommends
cEEG monitoring for TBI patients with altered mental status
or intracranial hemorrhage [ 106,107].
Despite incidence of isolated or recurrent epileptic seizures,
patients with moderate to severe TBI also have a high inci-
dence of status epilepticus which is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Status epilepticus may be present in
6.6–8% of all patients with moderate to severe TBI on cEEG
monitoring [ 108,109]. The presence of status epilepticus is
associated with worse mortality. In one study of 91 patients
with severe TBI on cEEG monitoring, all patients with status
epilepticus died, whereas patients without status epilepticus
only had a 24% associated mortality [ 108].
2.12. EEG in ischemic stroke
Stroke is the third most common cause of death and the
leading cause of acquired neurologic handicap in adult [ 110].
EEG is very sensitive to changes in neuronal function resulting
from ischemia [ 111]. In conditions of mild to moderate ische-
mia, EEG shows changes in rhythmic activities. A decrease in
alpha and beta activities is followed by an increase in the delta
band, depending on the severity and duration of ischemia
[112]. During ischemic stroke, excitotoxicity triggers
a number of events that can further contribute to tissue
death. Such events include peri-infarct depolarizations and
spreading depolarization within the ischemic penumbra [ 113].
Acute stroke causes 22% –30% of adult status epilepticus
cases [ 114]. Long-term cumulative risk of post-stroke epilepsy
varies from 3% to 30% [ 115] and the risk of developing
epilepsy remains high up to 10 years after stroke [ 116].cEEG monitoring studies show that most early seizures
occurred within the first 24 h [ 109]. Some studies have
attempted to delineate interictal EEG findings able to predict
a major risk of developing seizures or epilepsy and PLEDs are
significantly more frequent in patients with early-onset sei-
zures [ 117]. The involvement of the parieto-temporal junction,
supramarginal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus enhances
the risk of developing epilepsy [ 118]. Early seizures are more
frequently partial seizures. Late seizures are more frequently
generalized or secondarily generalized [ 117].
In conclusion, in stroke patients, cEEG is indicated in the
case of unexplained alteration of consciousness and should be
performed in the case of PLEDs.
3. Emergency EEG in ICU
EEG is one of the simplest ways to investigate cerebral activity
in ICU, easily recorded at the bedside and sensitive to changes
in both brain structure and function. In the last years cEEG
monitoring in critically ill patients has increased and it was
recommended by international guidelines with well-defined
indications [ 9]. There was a > 10-fold increase in cEEG use
from 2004 to 2013 [ 119].
However, despite cVEEG was associated with lower in-
hospital mortality, it was used for only 0.3% of the critically
ill population. While administrative claims analysis supports
the utility of cV-EEG for critically ill patients, findings suggest
variable benefit by diagnosis, and investigation with greater
clinical detail is warranted [ 120].
Within the ICU setting, cV-EEG is most useful in the evalua-
tion of subclinical or subtle clinical seizures. cV-EEG allows the
implementation of management goals and therapeutic tar-
gets, such as seizure cessation or specific EEG pattern such
as burst suppression, may precede and predict neurologic
outcome. It is also useful in identification of dynamic lesion
such as secondary ischemia. cEEG can help in the assessment
of altered mental status and rarely contributes to establishing
a specific etiology to an unclear presentation. Nevertheless,
clinical indications for cVEEG are often not homogeneous in
literature, and it still represents an underused tool. Traditional
30–60 min EEG recordings identify non-convulsive seizures in
only 45 –58% of patients in whom seizures are eventually
recorded. To exclude this condition, a consensus statement
of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society recom-
mends use of cVEEG after seizures, if impaired consciousness
persists after initial treatment [ 40].
About 80 –95% of patients with non-convulsive seizures can
be identified within 24 –48 h [ 9]. Recording for at least 24 h is
recommended, but in some cases shorter or longer periods
may be necessary. In ICU patients admitted for seizures,
DeLorenzo et al. [ 32], using cEEG monitoring, reported that
non convulsive seizures were observed in 48% of cases, and
NCSE in 14% of cases.
Claassen et al. [ 121] also identified non convulsive seizures
with cEEG monitoring in 25% of 570 critical care patients; in
a subgroup of 110 patients who had seizures before monitor-
ing, non-convulsive seizures were observed on cEEG in 43% of
the cases. In one prospective study, 75% of diagnoses of NCSE
or non-convulsive seizures on cEEG were not preceded by12 U. RAUCCI ET AL.clinical seizures. In these cases, symptoms may be subtle or
absent [ 9] as well as in coma, associated with NCSE in over
10% of patients [ 122]. Moreover, cEEG is mandatory when
specific EEG patterns are recognized on routine recording
[123] such as GPEDs, PLEDs, or BIPEDs. Several conditions
have been reported to be correlated with NCSE, with inci-
dences of up to 30% in subarachnoid hemorrhage, head
injury, intracerebral hemorrhage, CNS infections. The inci-
dence may be even higher in post-anoxic encephalopathy,
ranging from 10 to 60%. When neuromuscular blocking
drugs are used cEEG should be initiated as soon as possible,
as higher morbidity and mortality has been observed, and
early treatments are likely to be more effective [ 124].
Finally, EEG data in ICU are easily contaminated by signals
of non-neural origin. Artifact independent components can be
often identified via visual inspection but are often ambiguous
and even experts may disagree about how to categorize
a particular component [ 125]. Recently, the application of
methods to automatically select artifactual components for
rejection, and implementation of selection algorithms looks
particularly promising [ 126,127]. However, no automated
method can accurately isolate artifacts without supervision,
although this may improve objectivity and reproducibility in
reporting pre-processing procedures. Continuous EEG moni-
toring in the ICU is different from a planned EEG due to the
rather urgent nature of the indications, and it requires a close
collaboration between neurophysiology teams and intensive
care teams. It is preferable to work within a tele-EEG network,
so that the neurophysiologist has the possibility to give an
interpretation on call, and EEG recordings can be sent to them
for remote interpretation. Tele-EEG procedures and related
technical guidelines can be considered a complete medical
act that needs to be carried out with the same quality require-
ments as a local one in terms of indications, formulation of the
medical request and medical interpretation. As it regards for
the related human resources, materials, tele-EEG network and
medical fees of the physician interpreting the EEG recording, it
must adheres to the same quality requirements and should
follow all rules and guidelines of good medical practices. The
financial model of this organization must be detailed in
a convention between all parties involved (physicians, man-
agement of the healthcare structure, and the company provid-
ing the tele-EEG service) which, on the other hand, must
respect all rules for safety and confidentiality, and ensure the
traceability and storing of all requests and reports [ 128 –130].
4. Conclusions
Although considered a cheap, not invasive, highly accurate
diagnostic investigation, still today, obtaining an EEG record-
ing in ED and or ICU, as soon as possible, it is not yet been
routine, in many institutions. Nevertheless, Video-EEG and
eEEG recording in ED and or ICU has been demonstrated to
be a fundamental diagnostic tool in the both, Adult and
Pediatric Age, due to its high predictive value for identification
of neurological conditions/diseases requiring both, further
diagnostic investigations and hospitalizations, or, conversely,
a prompt, crucial, specific, and appropriate therapeutic choice,
followed by an immediate resolution of, sometimes, dramaticclinical pictures; in some of these patients, an EEG recording
can identify suggestive or, more rarely, pathognomonic EEG
pattern, allowing a specific disease diagnosis.
On the basis of a literature revision, we can suggest
expanding the use of eEEG and Video-EEG recording in ED
and, obviously even more in ICU, for neurological patients not
only affected by possible status epilepticus (convulsive or non-
convulsive) and paroxysmal non-epileptic events, but also in
many other conditions/diseases presenting with neurological
signs and symptoms associated with major traumatic brain
injuries, cerebral infections, acute cerebrovascular accidents,
change in mental status, coma, and, even, rarely, for persistent
headache not responsive to therapeutic drugs administrations.
5. Expert opinion
EEG recording remains the hallmark tool for investigations of
patients with epileptic seizures or paroxysmal non-epileptic
events, change in mental status and coma, as well as assess-
ment of brain death. The transition from analogue EEG record-
ing to technological digital instrumentation and, even more
recently, to the synchronous recording of video and EEG
(V-EEG) for prolonged periods of time, has led, in many cen-
ters, to the possibility of using in emergency departments, an
efficient and effective diagnostic tool that can improve and
speed up the timely diagnosis, on the one hand, of immedi-
ately reversible conditions/diseases and, on the other hand, to
the identification of conditions/diseases that require hospita-
lization in ICU and surveillance and prolonged treatments and
more in-depth investigations. These technological digital
improvements, over the last 20 years, have expanded rather
dramatically the requests for immediate performance of eEEG,
in many neurological conditions, for adults and children
admitted in ED and ICU, although, vice versa, the scarce avail-
ability of equipment and technical experts in this field, limit
the performance of EEG in these settings.
Another important aspect is represented by the electrically hostile
environments which is a challenging question, particularly in pediatric
age; however, given the importance of the need for a correct emer-
gency diagnosis to reduce mortalit y and health costs, efforts must be
multiplied to arrive at a correct and timely diagnosis of some neurolo-
gical conditions, whereas a prolong ed EEG registration can provide
clear and crucial information for tim ely diagnosis and therapy adequate
and decisive. In fact, the recognition and appropriate diagnosis of
conditions such as seizures, pseudo- seizures, change in mental status
of different etio-pathogenetic origins and brain death in the ED are
essential for immediate and future management and prognosis.
Starting from this perspective, our review was aimed to
evaluate all EEG literature in Adult and Pediatric emergency
clinical setting (both, in ED and ICU), considering EEG, Video-
EEG and cEEG, and highlighting their role in differential diag-
nosis and predictive prognosis.
Focusing our attention mainly on three aspects (when, why
and age-related peculiarities for requiring eEEG/V-EEG in ED) we
discuss the main and relevant clinical conditions in which eEEG
should be considered; in addition, it should be specified, that the
decision to initiate an EEG recording, the frequency of review,
and communication of results to ED and/or ICU caregivers/EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS 13physicians can be different according to local resources, mon-
itoring indications, EEG findings, and the patient ’s clinical status.
The effort we have put into writing this literature review is
justified by the need to make a prompt recognition of some
severe neurological diseases and their differential diagnosis by
using of awake/sleep standard-EEG, eEEG and/or Video-
poligraphic/EEG in EDs/ICUs, in acute, brief or long-term mon-
itoring, in emergency settings. Although, the use of these
techniques, and mainly the timing of their performances,
have been still widely debated, this review highlights the
importance of emergency EEGs and video-EEGs in clinical
practice for the recognition of different neurological diseases
and a related correct diagnostic and therapeutic follow-up, as
well as, to evaluate the cost –benefit balance of their standard
management in acute and emergency rooms.

a neurological consultation may occur in a critical care setting
and provides an update on the latest evidence regarding the
recognition of NCSE and the decision making around deter-
mining the aggressiveness of treatment. It also considers the
ictal-interictal continuum of conditions which may be met
with, particularly in the era of continuous EEG, and provides
an approach for dealing with these.
