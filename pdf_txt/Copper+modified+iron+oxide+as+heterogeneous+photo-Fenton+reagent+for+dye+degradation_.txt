The heterogeneous ph oto-Fenton degradation of crystal violet under visible light has been investigated using 
copper modified iron oxide. The photocatalyst has been prepared by coprecipitation method. The rate of 
photocatalyic  degradation of dye was monitored spectrophotometri cally. It has been observed that 
photocatalytic degradation follows pseudo first order kinetics. The effect of various parameters lik e pH, 
concentration of dye, amount of photocatalyst, amount of H 2O2 and light intensity on the rate of photo - 
Fenton degrad ation has also been observed. Photocatalyst has been characterized by IR spectroscopy, 
scanning electron microscopy and X -ray diffraction. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the reaction 
mixture before and after exposure was determined. A tentative mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation 
of crystal violet has also been proposed. Involvement of •OH radicals has been confirmed by using 
isopropanol and butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) as •OH radical scavengers. It has been observed that rate 
of reaction is dr astically reduced in the presence of these scavangers. Under similar conditions Fe 2O3 has 
also been prepared. The efficiency of Fe 2O3 and copper modified Fe 2O3 has been compared for the 
photocatalytic degradation of crystal violet.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Pollution of water caused by industries is a serious global problem all over the world and its 
remediati on is a great challenge for scientists. Dye wastes represent one of the most problematic 
groups of pollutants because they can be easily identified by the human eye and are not easily 
destroyed. Dyes cause a severe threat to environment because of their lo w biodegradability[1]. 
Advanced oxidation methods (AOP) can be effective in their degradation as they can result in 
almost complete mineralization in a less expensive and easy way. AOPs are based on the generation 
of very reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals (•OH) which have a very strong oxidation 
potential second to fluorine. Hydroxyl radicals rapidly and non selectively oxidize a broad range of  N. Ameta  et al., J. Iranian  Chem. Res. 5 (4) (2012) 241-253 
 
 242organic pollutants. Common AOPs involve photocatalytic, Fenton processes, photo -Fenton process, 
ozonation , photochemical and electrochemical oxidation.  Photocatalytic process is well known 
method for wastewater treatment.  
Photocatalytic degradation of dye effluents by titanium dioxide pillar pellets in aqueous 
solution has been observed by Li et al [2]. Photo catalytic degradation of brilliant red dye and textile 
wastewater has been investigated by Martins et al.[3]  
The Fenton reagent consisting of H 2O2 and Fe (II) is a strong oxidizing agent. In this reaction 
ferrous ion react with hydrogen peroxide and genera te •OH radicals which are the active species in 
oxidation of organic compounds [4]. Vlyssides et al. investigated small sewage treatment works 
using a Fenton oxidation method[5]. Degradation of phenol with Fenton like treatment by using 
heterogeneous modif ied iron oxide and hydrogen peroxide was studied by Lee et al.[6]   
But the main drawback of the Fenton reaction is that the reaction becomes very slow after 
consumption of ferrous ions. This drawback of Fenton reaction can be overcome by the use of 
photo -Fenton reaction. The degradation of different organic pollutants by homogeneous photo -
Fenton reagent has been known for over a century. In this reaction, the generated •OH radicals 
decompose organic compounds to smaller end products.  Gomati Devi et al. studied 
photodegradation of methyl red by advanced and homogeneous photo -Fenton’s  processes[7]. 
Homogeneous photo -Fenton degradation of 1,2,9,10 -tetrachlorodecane in aqueous solution using 
hydrogen peroxide, iron and UV light has been observed by Morsi et al. [8] Punjabi et al. carried out 
photocatalytic degradation of phenol red and sunset yellow FCF using complexes of some transition 
metals and hydrogen peroxide. [9,10]  In homogeneous photo -Fenton   process the iron ions remain 
in water solution after catalyt ic reaction is over.  This disadvantage of the homogeneous catalytic 
system can be overcome with the use of heterogeneous photo - Fenton catalytic system. 
Photo -Fenton - and Photo -Fenton like degradation of a textile dyes by heterogeneous processes 
with Fe/Z SM-5 Zeolite has been observed by Duarte and Madiera[10]. Heterogeneous catalytic 
treatment of synthetic dyes in aqueous medium using Fenton and photo -assisted Fenton process has 
been studied by Soon and  Hameed[11]. Martinez et al. studied heterogeneous p hoto-Fenton 
degradation of phenolic aqueous solutions over iron -containing SBA -15 catalyst [12]. Synthesis, 
characterization and visible light photo -Fenton catalytic activity of hydroxy Fe/Al intercalated 
montmorrilonite has been studied by Li et al. [13]  
Feng et al. studied discoloration and mineralization of reactive red HE -3B by heterogeneous 
photo -Fenton reaction [14]. Highly active S -modified ZnFe 2O4 heterogeneous catalyst and its 
photo -Fenton behavior under UV –visible irradiation was studied by Liu e t al.[15] Heterogeneous 
photo -Fenton photodegradation of reactive brilliant orange X -GN over iron -pillared 
montmorillonite under visible irradiation was observed by Chen et al[16].  Plata et al. studied 
decomposition of 2 -chlorophenol employing goethite as  Fenton catalyst [17]. Yang et al. observed 
degradation of methylene blue by heterogeneous Fenton reaction using titanomagnetite at neutral 
pH values [18].   
A study of catalytic behaviour of aromatic additives on the photo -Fenton degradation of phenol 
red was examined by Jain et al.[19] Degradation of bismark brown -R using copper loaded neutral 
alumina as heterogeneous photo -Fenton reagent has been studied by sharma et al.[20] . 
 
2. EXPERIMENTAL  
 
2.1. Preparation of photocatalyst  
 
In the present investigatio n, a modified iron oxide catalyst has been prepared in the following 
manner. 50g FeSO 4.7H 2O was dissolved in 250 mL of water and 25 g of CuSO 4.5H 2O was 
dissolved in 250 mL of water and both solutions were mixed. Then aqueous NaOH was added 
dropwise and the  pH was adjusted to 9.0. The content was agitated for 40 mins. The precipitate was N. Ameta  et al., J. Iranian  Chem. Res. 5 (4) (2012) 241-253 
 
 243filtered, washed with water to ensure complete removal of the NaOH and sulphate ions (SO 42-) and 
air dried. The precipitate was kept in a muffle furnace at 400°C for 2 hours . 
 
2.2. Characterization by SEM and FTIR  
  
Scanning electron microscopy (Model -Leo 430 Cambridge) has been used to observe the 
morphological changes caused by loading of copper ions in Fe 2O3. It has been observed that loading 
of copper ions lead to the for mation of smaller and more regular particles of the catalyst. This factor 
has led to the increased surface area of the catalyst and therefore, increased rate of photo -Fenton 
degradation. The SEM photographs of pure  and modified Fe 2O3   are shown in Fig. 1 and 2, 
respectively.  
The particle size of pure Fe2O3 and Cu –modified Fe 2O3 was measured with the help of SEM 
and it was observed that the average particle size is 5µm and 40 µm, respectively.

 Fig. 2 . Cu loaded Fe 2O3. 
 
 
2.3. FT-IR 
 
A characteristic band at 459 cm-1 due to Fe -O stretching is present in the FT -IR of pure sample 
of Fe 2O3 [21]. A band at 592 cm-1 due to Cu -O stretching is obtained i n the FT -IR of Cu - modified 
Fe2O3 in addition to band due to Fe -O stretching. It clearly indicates that the loading of copper in 
Fe2O3 has taken place successfully.  
 
2.4. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS)  
 
Stability of the catalyst was checked by Atomic  Absorption Spectroscopy using ECTL 4129A 
atomic Absorption spectrophotometer. Even after one month leaching of copper ions from the N. Ameta  et al., J. Iranian  Chem. Res. 5 (4) (2012) 241-253 
 
 244catalyst was found to be negligible . Thus catalyst was found to posses good stability for its use as 
heterogeneous photo -Fenton like reagent under visible range.  
 
2.5. X-Ray Diffraction studies  
 
XRD diffraction patterns of the samples were recorded on 18 KW X -Ray diffractometer using 
Cu Kα radiation. Diffraction patterns were recorded over the 2θ range from 10 º to 90 º with a step 
size of 0.05º.  
The Fig 3 and 4 illustrates the indexed XRD patterns of the pure Fe 2O3 and Cu modified Fe 2O3, 
all the bragg reflection s have been indexed in rhombohedral structure in the hexagonal setting. 
(Space group: R -3C No. 167)  
The obtained value of the cell parameters for the pure Fe 2O3: a = 5.035 (5) Aº, c = 13.799 (17) 
Aº are in very good agreement with reported standard values a = 5.035 Aº, c = 13.748 Aº. Relative 
changes in the peak position and peak intensity in the Cu modified Fe 2O3 clearly indicates that Cu 
atoms are well incorporated in the Fe 2O3 matrix. The obtained values of the cell parameters in Cu 
modified Fe 2O3 are a= 5 .059(5) Aº and c = 13.8222(15) Aº.  
Thus the unit cell slightly expands relative to pure Fe 2O3, which is consistent with the 
substitution of larger cation Cu2+ (0.72 Aº) on the Fe3+ (0.64 Aº) sites. The partial occupancy of the 
interstitial octahedral site would be expected to further increase in the expansion.

Stock solution of crystal violet (10-3 M Himedia ) was prepared. Degra dation of  crystal violet 
was observed by taking 40.0 mL mixture of 1.75 × 10-5 M dye solution, 0.15 mL H 2O2 (CBH, 30 % 
vol.) and 0.03 g Cu - modified Fe 2O3. The reaction mixture was irradiated with a 200 W tungsten 
lamp (Philips). The intensity of light at  various distances from the lamp was measured using a 
solarimeter (SM CEL 201). A water filter has been used to cut off thermal radiations. A digital pH 
meter (Model 232) was used to measure the pH of the reaction mixture. The pH of the solution was 
adjust ed by the addition of previously standardized 0.1 N sulphuric acid and 0.1 N sodium 
hydroxide solution. The progress of the photo -Fenton degradation was monitored by measuring the 
absorbance of the reaction mixture at regular time intervals using UV visibl e spectrophotometer 
(Systronics Model 106). IR spectrum of Cu - modified and pure Fe 2O3 has been obtained using 8400 
S FTIR spectrophotometer. SEM pictures of the catalysts were obtained using Model - Leo 430 
Cambridge.  Different quality parameters for water  has been determined by using water analyser 
Systronics Model 371.  
 
3. RE SULTS  AND DISCUSSION  
 
An aliquot of 3.0 mL was taken out from the reaction mixture at definite time intervals and the 
absorbance was measured at 590 nm. It was observed that the absor bance of the solution decreases 
with increasing time intervals, which indicates that the concentration of crystal violet decreases w ith 
increasing time of exposure. A plot of 2 + log A against time was linear and follows pseudo -first 
order kinetics. The ra te constant was measured with the expression.

3.1. Effect o f pH      
  
The effect of pH on the rate of photo -Fenton degradation ha s been investigated in pH range 
6.5-10.0. It has been observed that with an increase in pH, rate of reaction increases and after 
attaining the maximum value at pH 8.5, rate decreases wi th further increase in pH. The optimum 
value was obtained for pH 8.5. The increase in rate of degradation on increasing pH may be 
explained by the fact that larger numbers of hydroxyl ions are available at higher pH values.  These  –
OH ions will generate mor e •OH radicals resulting in higher rate of degradation of dye. But on 
increasing the pH  above 8.5 degradation rate decreases due to the fact that dye does not remain in 
its cationic form because -OH ions surround dye molecules at higher pH, therefore there  is repulsion 
between dye molecules and negatively ch arged catalyst surface and so number of molecules 
approaching the catalyst surface also decreases . As a resu lt, the rate of degradation  decreases.

3.2. Effect of Concentration of Dye   
  
The effect of variation of concentration of dye on the rate of photo -Fenton degradation has 
been observed in the range from 0 .75 × 10-5 M – 2.50 × 10-5M. It has been observed that the rate of 
degradation increases w ith increasing concentration of crystal violet up to 1.75 × 10-5 M. Further 
increase in concentration beyond 1.75 × 10-5 M decreases the rate of degradation. This may be 
explained on the basis that initially, on increasing the concentration of dye, the rea ction rate 
increases as more molecules of dye are  available for degradation. But further increase in 
concentration beyond 1.75 × 10-5 M causes retardation of reaction due to number of collisions 
among dye molecules increase whereas, collisions  among dye a nd •OH radicals decrease. As a 
consequence, rate of reaction is retarded.

3.3. Effect of amount of photocatalyst   
                                                                                                                                
The effect of variation of amount of photocatalyst has also been observed on the rate of photo -
Fenton degradation. As clear from the above data that with incr ease in the amount of catalyst, the 
rate of photo -Fenton reaction increases to a certain amount of catalyst (0.03 g), which may be 
regarded as a saturation point. Beyond this point, the rate of reaction decreases with increase in 
amount of catalyst. This m ay be explained by the fact that with the increase in the amount of 
catalyst, the surface area of catalyst will increase. Hence, the rise in the rate of reaction has be en 
observed. But after a certain limiting amount of catalyst (0.03g), if the amount of p hotocatalyst was 
further increased, it would also increase the number of iron and copper ions and then there is a 
possibility  of short circuiting between  ferrous & ferric and cuprous & cupric ions. As a result, less 
number of hydroxyl radicals are formed a nd reaction rate is retarded.

3.4. Effect of H 2O2 
                                                          
The effect of variation of amount of H 2O2 on the photo -Fenton degradation of crystal violet has 
also been investigated in the range from 0.05 mL to 0.40 mL.  It has been observed that initially 
upon i ncrease of H 2O2 from 0.05 mL – 0.15 mL, the rate of degradation increases. However, beyond 
0.15 mL the rate of photo -Fenton degradation decreases. It may be attributed to the  fact that  •OH 
radicals react  with increasing amount of H 2O2. The reaction generates hydroperoxy radicals (HO 2•) 
which  are less powerful oxidizing agent as compared to •OH radical.  
 
                                                             … (2)  
 
 
As a result, a decrease in rate of reaction has been observed  beyond 0.1 5mL of H 2O2

3.5. Effect of Light Intensity  
 
The data indicate that as we increase light intensity, the rate of reaction also increases and 
maximum rate has been found at 70.0 mWcm-2. It may be explained on the basis that as light 
intensity was increased, the number of photons striking per unit area also increase, resulting into 
higher rate of degradation. Further increase in the light intensity beyond 70.0 mWcm-2 results in a 
decrease in the rate of reaction. It may be probably due to thermal side reactions.

3.6. Mechanism  
 
On the basis of the experimental observations and corroborating t he existing literature, a 
tentative mechanism has been proposed for the degradation of crystal violet by photo -Fenton 
reagent  
 
   
                                  …(3)

               … (6)  
The •OH radical is non selective and strong oxidizing agent with high oxidation potential, 
which is relatively high as compared to common oxidizing agent like H 2O2, O3, O 2 etc. These •OH 
radicals react with dye and degrade it into smaller products like CO 2, NO 3- ions etc. These products 
have been identified by usual chemical tests.

The involvement of •OH radicals in the reaction has been confirmed by carrying out the 
reaction in presence of •OH radical scavenger, e.g., 2 -propanol and butylated hydroxy toluene 
(BHT). In presence of 2 -propanol and BHT, reaction rate has been found to be drastically reduced.  
 
3.7. Quality parameters of water  
 
Quality of water  before and after photo -Fenton degadation  has been tested by measuring some 
parameters

Chemical oxygen demand of dye solution before and after illumination has been determined by 
redox method.  COD of dye solution before and after exposure was found to be 22 mg/L and 7 
mg/L, respectively. The  photodegradation efficiency after 2 hours of illumination has been found to 
be 68 %.   
 
3.7.2. Dissolve d Oxygen  
 
Dissolved oxygen analysis measures the amount of gaseous oxygen dissolved in an aqueous 
solution. Increase in dissolved oxygen after photo -Fenton degradation indicates mineralization of 
dye to a significant extent.  
 
3.7.3. Conductivity  
 
Conductivity as a summation parameter is a measure of the level of ion concentration of a 
solution. Conductivity parameter has been increased after the treatmen t because dye has been 
mineralized into  ions like CO 32- , NO 3-, SO 42- etc. Because of the same reason, total dissolved solids 
(TDS) and salinity of the dye solution has been found to increase after photo -Fenton degradation of 
dye. 
 
3.7.4. pH 
 
Before the tr eatment pH of reaction mixture is basic but after the degradation pH becomes 
neutral because dye particles are  mineralized in  significant extent . 
 
4. CONCLUSION  
 
Cu–modified Fe 2O3 catalyst has been prepared by co - precipitation method, using ferrous 
sulph ate and copper sulphate as precursors. The amount of photo -Fenton catalyst required (typically 
around 0.03 g in 40 mL) is much less than that usually used earlier. The effect of the amount of 
photo -Fenton catalyst, hydrogen peroxide, concentration of dye, pH of the reaction medium and 
light intensity were observed on rate of reactions.  At optimal conditions, rate of degradation for 
crystal violet dye was found to be as k = 2.87 × 10-4. However, in presence of pure Fe 2O3, rate of 
photo -Fenton degradation wa s to be 2.16 x 10-4 . During heterogeneous photo -Fenton process, •OH 
radicals  react with dye and degrade it into smaller products like H 2O, CO 2,  NO 3-   ions etc.
