1. Introduction
Conventional oral drug administration does not
usually provide rate-controlled release or target speci-ﬁcity. In many cases, conventional drug deliveryprovides sharp increases of drug concentration atpotentially toxic levels. Following a relatively shortperiod at the therapeutic level, drug concentrationeventually drops off until re-administration. Todaynew methods of drug delivery are possible: desireddrug release can be provided by rate-controllingmembranes or by implanted biodegradable polymerscontaining dispersed medication.
Over the past 25 years much research has also been

and Nixon, 1990b; Kawaguchi, 2000; Mueller et al.,2001;EdlundandAlbertsson,2002;Vasiretal.,2003 )
and this review covers recent works not yet summa-rizedandprovidesinformationregardingmanyfactorsaffecting microsphere drug release and the manipula-tionofphysical/chemicalpropertiestoachievedesiredresults.
The idea of controlled release from polymers dates
back to the 1960s through the employment of siliconerubber (Folkman and Long, 1964 ) and polyethylene
(Desai et al., 1965 ). The lack of degradability in these
systems implies the requirement of eventual surgicalremoval and limits their applicability. In the 1970sbiodegradablepolymersweresuggestedasappropriate

incorporated by Mason et al. (1976) through the em-
ployment of a degradable polymer coating; the topicwas reviewed by Marty and Oppenheim (1977) .
Recent literature shows that suspensions of degrad-
able microspheres can be employed for sustaineddrug release at desirable doses and by implantationwithout surgical procedures. Biocompatibility can beachieved by the use of natural polymers such as cel-lulose, chitin, and chitosan or by the employment ofpolymers made from naturally occurring monomerssuch as lactic and glycolic acids ( Fig. 1). Polymers
derived from synthetic monomers also show excellentdelivery properties. However, their toxicity effectsmay require evaluation.
The factors affecting drug release are controllable;
they are attributed to properties such as polymermolecular weight, as well as microsphere size, distri-bution, morphology and make-up.
2. Preparation
2.1. Microspheres prepared by polymerization of
monomers
Althoughmostmicrospheresemployedfordrugde-
livery are prepared from linear polymers, the prepa-ration of microspheres from monomers are still ofrelevance. It involves the polymerization of colloidalmonomers dispersed in a liquid with opposite solu-
bilities (Kiminta et al., 1996 ). Spherical droplets are
formed by oil-soluble organic monomers dispersed inaqueousmedia(oilinwater,O/W)orbywater-solublemonomers dissolved in water dispersed in an organicmedium (water in oil, W/O; Candau, 1985 ).
The polymerization of dispersed monomers is
achievable by various methods including emulsion,suspension, and dispersion techniques ( Piirma, 1985 ).
Emulsions are typically used to form uniform sphereson nanometer scales (10–10
4(nm). The technique
typically involves the dispersion of a hydrocarbonmonomer in water with a water-soluble initiator. Asurfactant is employed for the formation of uniformmicelles; polymerization takes place inside micellesandnotinsidethedispersedorganicmonomerdropletssince the initiator is not miscible there. The resultingpolymer beads can be so uniform on the nano-scalethat they may diffract visible light ( Weissman et al.,
1996).
Dispersion polymerization results in particle sizes
in the range of 0.5–10( /H9262m and all of the reagents in-
cluding monomer, initiator, and stabilizer (often anorganic polymer consisting of hydrophobic and hy-drophilic parts) are dissolved in an organic medium.Sincetheinitiatorissolubleinsidethemonomer,poly-merization takes place inside the monomer droplets.The polymer beads, insoluble in the organic solvent,precipitate, and the stabilizer prevents bead ﬂoccula-tion (Barrett, 1975; Strover and Li, 1996 ).
Suspensionpolymerizationsaretypicallyemployed
for micron-sized particles (50–500( /H9262m). In suspen-
sion polymerization the monomer is dispersed in aS. Freiberg, X.X. Zhu/International Journal of Pharmaceutics 282 (2004) 1–18 3

themonomerphasewherepolymerizationoccurs.Thesize and quantity of the particles is determined by thesize and quantity of dispersed monomer droplets andby the speed of mechanical stirring ( Piirma, 1985 ).
Recently, Ruckenstein and co-workers have also
obtained uniform polymer beads on the millimeterscale by sedimentation polymerization ( Ruckenstein
and Hong, 1995; Ruckenstein and Sun, 1996 ) which
involvesthegravitationalascentofpolymerizingaque-ous monomer droplets in hot parafﬁn oil. At the endof the decent period (7–9(s), the spheres continue topolymerize without coalescing. Amsden (1999) has
also developed a similar method for forming beads onthe size of millimeters by employing a solvated linearpolymer. Droplets of the polymer in organic solutionwere added to a ﬂowing solution of poly(vinyl alco-hol) (PVA, as stabilizer)/water solution; at the end ofthe ﬂowing procedure uniform-sized beads were col-lected.

et al., 1997; Canelas and DeSimone, 1997 ). Some of

Some commonly employed microsphere prepara-
tionmethodsarethesolventevaporationtechnique(orthe double emulsion technique) and the spray dryingtechnique. These and other methods are described byVasir et al. (2003) in a review on bioadhesive micro-
spheres (Vasir et al., 2003 ).
The spray drying technique has been described
byMasters (1985) . Also,Berkland et al. (2001) de-
scribed spay drying techniques for the formation ofvery monodisperse spheres and evaluated their meth-ods for use with poly(lactide-co-glycolide)s (PLGAs;Pavanetto et al., 1993 ).Witchi and Doelker (1998)
also offered a comparison of the properties of micro-spheres prepared by the solvent removal technique orthe spray drying technique.
2.3. Preparation by the solvent evaporation method
Microspheres can be formed by the evaporation of
anorganicsolventfromdispersedoildropletscontain-ing both polymer and drug ( Fig. 2;Jalil and Nixon,
1989, 1990c; Huang et al., 1997; Atkins et al., 1998;Edlund and Albertsson, 1999; Oh et al., 1999; Pistelet al., 1999; Bai et al., 2001 ). Often, a double emul-
sion is employed; ﬁrst the drug for encapsulation is

1995a,b;Ghaderi et al., 1996 ).
2.3.1. Encapsulation efﬁciency
Increasing or controlling the encapsulation efﬁ-
ciency (EE) is desirable, it can prevent the loss ofprecious medication and it can help to extend theduration and dosage of treatment. The drug contentof the encapsulated microspheres can be described bytwo quantities. The most common, also used in thispaper, is the EE, where EE =/Delta1D/D
T;DTis the total
amount of drug employed and /Delta1DisDTminus the
amount of unloaded drug ( Gupta and Kumar, 2001 ).
On the other hand, the loading capacity (LC) is de-ﬁned as LC =/Delta1D/S
W, whereSWis the weight of the
sphere (Gupta and Kumar, 2001 ). Issues of relevance
concerning EE include sphere formation temperatureand the nature of the polymer.
Yang et al. (2000) have provided a revealing study
which correlated EE to sphere preparation tempera-ture. The authors found that the highest EEs occurredatthelowestandhighestformationtemperaturestested(about 50% at 4 and 38(
◦C, and about 19% at 22 and
29(◦C). The non-linear drug loading trend suggested
that different mechanisms governed the encapsulationprocess at different temperatures. At lower tempera-tures, increased immiscibility between the sphere andwater resulted in a rapidly forming outer sphere wall,thus trapping the drug early in the evaporation pro-cess (Chung, 1997 ). At higher temperatures, an in-
creased rate of solvent evaporation also resulted in arapidlyhardeningspherewall.Inbothcasesdrugtrap-ping was enhanced by hardening at the sphere wall,an important point when considering drug encapsula-tion.
When considering the relation of the polymer itself
to EE,Ghaderi et al. (1996) found that increasing
the concentration of polymer in the organic phaseincreased the EE. An increase in EE from 1 to 25%was observed depending on the concentration ofthe polymer. Considering the nature of the polymer,
LeCorre et al. (1994) obtained different EEs for two
very similar polymers, PLA and PLGA, even whenthe microspheres were prepared under similar con-ditions. Obtained drug loadings for PLAs and PGAswere found to be 21–46%, respectively, this may beattributed to faster precipitation of the PGAs at thesphere interface.
2.3.2. Control of microsphere size
Microsphere size can be affected by the polymer
concentration in the second emulsion, temperature,viscosity,thestirringrateinthesecondemulsionstep,and the amount of emulsiﬁer employed. Consideringthe effect of polymer concentration, it has often beenreported that increasing the concentration of polymerin the second emulsion increases sphere size ( Yan
et al., 1994; Ghaderi et al., 1996; McGee et al., 1997;Schlicher et al., 1997; Lin and Vasavada, 2000 ).
In another study, Yang et al. (2000) used scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) to show that sphere sizewas temperature dependent; lower and higher temper-atures produced larger spheres whereas intermediatetemperatures produced smaller spheres. Once again,different mechanisms dominated microsphere forma-tion at different temperatures. At lower temperatures,the solution’s higher viscosity resulted in the forma-tion of larger spheres; this has also been conﬁrmedby other researchers ( Jeyanthi et al., 1997 ). Larger
spheres were obtained at higher temperatures due tothe higher rate of solvent evaporation which resultedin higher solvent ﬂow pressure moving more materialfrom the sphere center outward ( Yang et al., 2000 ).
Jalil and Nixon (1990a) studied the variation of
sphere size with respect to the stirring rate and the in-ﬂuenceoftheemulsiﬁerinthesecondemulsionstep.Itwas shown that microsphere size decreased with in-creasing stirring rate since increased stirring resultsin the formation of ﬁner emulsions. The authors em-ployed a sorbitan ester as an emulsiﬁer and reporteda sharp drop in diameter when the sorbitan ester con-centration was increased from 1 to 2%. Little changein diameter size was reported by increasing emulsi-ﬁer concentration beyond 2%. It is possible that inthis particular case, emulsiﬁer packing was optimumat2%concentrationandthatnomoreemulsiﬁercouldbe adsorbed at the sphere surface above this concen-tration (Jalil and Nixon, 1990a ).S.

2.3.3. Control of sphere porosity
Porosity has an important effect on drug release
characteristics; a large number of pores may greatlyincreasetherateofdrugexpulsion( Yangetal.,2000 ).
The ﬁrst W/O emulsion can be used to control the
microspherepores; CrottsandPark(1995) haveshown
that sphere porosity increased with the water contentin the ﬁrst emulsion. When the ﬁrst water-in-oil sys-tem contained less water, porosity decreased; the for-mation of spheres by skipping the ﬁrst water-in-oilstep resulted in spheres with a non-porous outer skinandamonolithicinnercomposition.Atlowwatercon-tents the inner core contained hollow structures anda non-porous skin. Porosity was observed throughoutthe particle at higher water content. In a related study,Tuncayetal.(2000) alsofoundthattheemploymentof
methanol instead of water in the ﬁrst emulsion phasemay reduce the surface porosity of the microspheres.
Li et al. (1995b) determined the effects of varying
the amount of water in the second emulsion or con-tinuous phase (CP) on porosity. The CP containingthe largest amount of water resulted in faster polymerprecipitation and therefore less porous spheres wereformed.Inanotherstudyby Jeyanthietal.(1996) con-
tinuously adding water to the CP of the dispersionup to 1.5 times the initial volume, the authors ob-tainedspherescontainingauniformhoneycombstruc-ture with no hollow core. Continuous dilution up to2.5timestheinitialvolumeresultedinsimilarspheresbutwithlargerpores.Thelargerporesatincreaseddi-lution were explained by an increased rate of solventremoval with increasing water content (higher solventﬂowexitpressures)whichoccursincoordinationwitha faster hardening rate ( Ghaderi et al., 1996; Jeyanthi
et al., 1996 ).
The rate at which the solvent is removed from the
sphere is dependent on temperature, pressure, and theamountofwaterintheﬁnalemulsionphaseandcanbedirectly related to sphere porosity ( Izumikawa et al.,
1991; Jeyanthi et al., 1996; Yang et al., 2000 ).Yang
et al. (2000) have systematically increased sphere
preparation temperature; their results suggested thatskin porosity tends to decrease with increasing tem-perature until a limiting value. Therefore, a relativelyhigh sphere formation temperature resulted in rapidhardening of the outer wall and low porosity. How-ever, very high temperatures resulted in a highlyporous skin and inner core due to the very rapidsolvent evaporation. Other researchers also showed
that high evaporation rates resulted in more porousspheres (Izumikawa et al., 1991; Chung et al., 2001 ).
Jeyanthi et al. (1996) have investigated sphere
porosity at variable temperatures; solvent removalwas well correlated to preparation temperature andthe solvent was removed more rapidly at highertemperatures. Quick solvent leaching from the softspheres formed hard spheres with hollow inner coresand thin outer walls, thus showing how the high ﬂowpressure of the evaporating solvent increases porosity.By varying the ramping conditions the authors wereable to create spheres with a thicker outer wall and asmaller core whose porosity was controllable by theramping steps ( Jeyanthi et al., 1996 ).
3. Factors affecting drug release rate
Controlled release is an attainable and desirable
characteristic for drug delivery systems. The factorsaffectingthedrugreleaseraterevolvearoundthestruc-ture of the matrix where the drug is contained andthe chemical properties associated with both the poly-mer and the drug. Conventional oral delivery is notrate controlled. A drug encapsulated in a slowly de-gradingmatrixprovidestheopportunityforslowerre-lease effects, but polymer degradation is not the onlymechanism for the release of a drug. The drug re-leaseisalsodiffusioncontrolledasthedrugcantravelthrough the pores formed during sphere hardening.In some cases, drugs containing nucleophilic groupscancauseincreasedchainscissionofthepolymerma-trix, which also increases the rate of drug expulsion.Polymermolecularweight,drugdistribution,polymerblending, crystallinity, and other factors are importantin manipulating release proﬁles.
The most desirable release proﬁle would show a
constant release rate with time. However, in manycases release proﬁles are more complicated and oftencontain two main expulsion processes: the ﬁrst beinganinitialburstofexpelledmedicationfromthespheresurface;thesecond,ausuallymoreconstantstagewithrelease rates dependent on diffusion and degradation(LeCorreetal.,1994;Ghaderietal.,1996;Mogietal.,
2000). An example showing the initial burst and lin-
ear release by Yang et al. (2000) is shown in Fig. 3.

constant release after the initial burst, some have been
able to achieve close to zero-order kinetics without asigniﬁcant burst effect, and others have obtained evenmorecomplexbutadjustableproﬁlesdependingonthedesired application ( Narayani and Rao, 1996; Makino
et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2000; Berkland et al., 2002;Kakish et al., 2002 ). In the following discussion, the
factors responsible for different release proﬁles willbe discussed in terms of physical and chemical prop-erties of the microsphere.
3.1. Polymer molecular weight
Degradationofpolymermicrospheresshowsaclear
dependence on the molecular weight (MW) of thepolymer. In a study by Park (1994) , it was found
that polymer spheres initially released small molecu-lar weight oligomers by rapid diffusion regardless ofMW; following the initial period, low MW degrada-tion products were released. In spheres initially con-taining lower MW chains, the quantity of degradationproductsincreasedwithtimeandthepolymersmakingup the microspheres decreased in molecular weight.However, for spheres made from high MW polymers,the quantity of degradation products and the polymerMW remained constant for longer periods of time.
Park (1994, 1995) provided evidence suggesting that
the varying degradation proﬁles occur due to the dif-ferencesinglasstransitiontemperatures( T
g)andcrys-
tallinity associated with polymers of different MW.
Makino et al. (2000) showed pulsatile drug release
in high MW PLGAs as shown in Fig. 4.A tl o w e r
MWs(19,000),arelativelyconstantreleaseproﬁlewasobtained; increasing the molecular weight to 23,000(Mogi et al., 2000 ), 44,000 and 74,000 decreased the
linearity of release ( Makino et al., 2000 ). The rate
of drug release from particles containing higher MWpolymers was initially high, followed by a decreasewhich was then followed again by an increase. Thetwo-stagereleaseproﬁlesuggestedthepresenceoftwodominating release mechanisms in high MW poly-mers. Degradation is the main release mechanism forlow MW polymers after the initial burst stage( Park,
1994). Spheres containing high MW polymers likely
undergo initial slow drug release due to diffusion, fol-lowed by the main drug release due to degradation.Makino et al. (2000) showed this by correlating ob-
served drug release with microscopic observation ofthe microspheres; the drug release was fastest for thedegradation of swollen spheres.S. Freiberg, X.X. Zhu/International Journal of Pharmaceutics 282 (2004) 1–18 7

release character increases with molecular weight from Makino et al. (2000) circles, MW =19000; triangles, MW =44,000; squares,
MW=74,000.
BlendingtwopolymersofdifferentMWsallowsthe
manipulation of the timing associated with the degra-dation release. LeCorre et al. (1994) combined a low
molecular weight PLA (MW =2000) and a higher
molecularweightPLA(MW =9000)toobtainanex-
tra degree of controlled release. Tuncay et al. (2000)
andRavivarapu et al. (2000) obtained similar results
using MW blends of PGAs and PLGAs, respectively,where the microspheres containing the lower MWpolymer released drug more rapidly.
3.2. Blends of structurally different polymers
As already discussed, the physical blending of
two polymers can affect the release proﬁles ofpolymer spheres. Edlund and Albertsson (2000)
have provided an important comparison of a blendsystem against the corresponding copolymer sys-tem involving poly( l-lactic acid) (PLLA) and
poly(1,5-dioxepan-2-one) (PDXO). Spheres madefrom the linear co-polymers were porous and largerthan those made from the blends. During degradation,the molecular weight loss was slower in the blendspheres due to their increased density. The release of
a hydrophilic drug was slower for the blend spheres(Fig. 5). Differences in morphology of the two types
of spheres made a signiﬁcant impact on the releaseproﬁle. It was also observed, by employing varyingmixtures of blend composition, that the degradationrate increased with increasing amounts of PDXO.The lower degradation rate of PLLA over PDXOwas attributed to the increased crystallinity in PLLA:the crystalline regions degrade more slowly than theamorphous regions ( Edlund and Albertsson, 2000 ).
Mi et al. (2002) blended hydrophobic PLGA with
hydrophilicchitinandexaminedthehydrationinthesesystems. It was found that the spheres with a highercontent of hydrophilic chitin degraded faster sincedegradation takes place more rapidly in chitin. Be-ing hydrophilic, chitin degraded by surface erosion,and the more hydrophobic PLGA degraded by bulkerosion, therefore a two-stage degradation proﬁle wasobserved. In the ﬁrst part of sphere degradation, fastrelease occurred due to the readily degradable chitinpolymer,whichwasthenfollowedbyaslowerreleasefrom the PLGA sections.8 S. Freiberg, X.X.

drug more slowly than its copolymer counterpart due to increased crystallinity in the blend system. Empty symbols represent the blendsystems and the solid symbols represent the copolymer systems. The consistency of the trend are shown by the two sets of data; thetriangles and the squares represent PLLA–PDXO ratios of a 90:10 and 70:30, respectively.
3.3. Crystallinity
Crystallinity in microspheres has been usually in-
vestigated by DSC or X-ray diffraction (XRD) stud-ies. DSC can detect phase transitions including themelting of crystalline regions, whereas XRD directlydetects the crystallinity properties of a material.
LeCorre et al. (1997) observed the crystallinity of
a lipophilic drug in polymer microspheres by DSC.Usually, drug has been found to be molecularly dis-persed inside a polymer matrix and crystallinity isnot observed ( Benita et al., 1984; Benoit et al., 1986;
LeCorre et al., 1997; Guyot and Fawaz, 1998 ). How-
ever,intheircase, LeCorreetal.(1997) foundthatthe
relatively highly loaded drug existed in a particulatedispersion instead of a molecular dispersion, which ispossibly due to its lack of solubility in the polymermatrix.
Yuksel et al. (1996) used XRD and DSC to in-
vestigate crystallinity and drug-polymer interactions.They observed that although a physical mixture of the
drugandpolymerexhibitedcrystallinity,thedrugwasamorphous after dispersion in the microspheres. At-tempts to crystallize the drug inside the microspheresbyannealingabovethepolymer’s T
g,andbyheat–cool
cycleswereunsuccessfulshowingclearmoleculardis-persion of the drug. In the same study it was shownthatmoleculardispersionsmaybemorefavorablethanparticulatedispersionsfordrugdeliverysincethedrugwas released more readily from a microsphere systemthan from a particulate form at pH 7.4. The polymermatrix likely disturbs drug crystallinity and initiatesrate-controlled delivery with higher drug delivery ef-ﬁciencies ( Yuksel et al., 1996 ).
Considering polymeric crystallinity, Edlund and
Albertsson(2000) suggestedthatdegradationoccurred
ﬁrst in the amorphous microsphere regions followedby a slower degradation in the crystalline regions.This suggests that the crystallinity in the polymerchains can affect the degradation rate. Furthermore,S. Freiberg, X.X. Zhu/International Journal of Pharmaceutics 282 (2004) 1–18 9
at the beginning of sphere degradation, the degree
of crystallinity actually increased slightly. This wasattributed to the crystallization of partly degradedchains and the preferential degradation of amorphousregions.
Izumikawa et al. (1991) studied polymer crys-
tallinity and drug crystallinity employing PLA mi-crospheres loaded with progesterone. At low drugloading (5%), XRD and DSC showed that the poly-mer dominates the crystalline properties of the mi-crosphere and no crystallinity arose from the drug;the drug was dispersed in the sphere. At high drugloading (30%), crystallinity was dependent on theorganic solvent removal process; at slow solvent re-moval rates sphere crystallinity was observed fromboththedrugandpolymerbutfastremovalresultedinamorphous spheres. At high concentrations and slowsolvent removal, the drug formed a particulate dis-persion resulting in the presence of drug crystallinity.However, the faster solvent removal rate may haveresulted in amorphous spheres by not giving the drugand polymer molecules adequate time to crystallize.Releaseproﬁlessuggestthatmoreamorphousspheresrelease the drug less rapidly than crystalline spheres.Therefore, the lack of polymer crystallinity suggestsbetter drug dispersion and increased drug–polymerinteractions. The drug release rate can be tailoredby manipulating the degree of crystallinity; re-duced crystallinity is favorable when slow release isdesired.
Fig. 6. Tertiary amine containing drugs loaded into a LPLA microsphere matrix as reported by Cha and Pitt (1989) . Drugs with less
sterically available amines are released more slowly from the matrix.3.4. Effects of the loaded drug
In some cases the drug employed can induce poly-
mer chain scission through nucleophilic degradation.Typically this is observed in medications containingamines whose nitrogen atom is nucleophilic, just likethe oxygen atom in water. Cha and Pitt (1989) re-
ported that sterically available amines increased therate of polymer degradation. PLLA was loaded withdifferent amine-containing drugs, the polymer MW inspheres containing the most active amine decreasedmorerapidlyandtoagreaterextentthroughoutthere-leaseprocess( Fig.6).Inthecaseofalessactive,ster-
ically hindered tertiary amine, polymer degradationwas not signiﬁcant nor was drug release, unless it wasco-loaded with another drug capable of causing poly-merchainscission.Othergroupshavealsoconsideredchain scission when reporting their results ( Cha and
Pitt, 1988; LeCorre et al., 1997; Tuncay et al., 2000 ).
How the drug is distributed in the medium can also
vary its release proﬁle ( Kakish et al., 2002 ). Drug re-
lease begins at the sphere surface followed by releasefrom the inner layers of the sphere; therefore the dif-fusional distance between the initial drug location in-side the sphere affects the release proﬁle ( Lee, 1984,
1985, 1986 ). Drug uniformly dispersed in the sphere
matrix can increase the initial burst effect; Kakish
et al. (2002) have successfully modiﬁed the drug dis-
tributioninmicrospheressoastoobtainconstantdrugrelease. The microspheres were modiﬁed by stirring10 S. Freiberg, X.X. Zhu/International Journal of Pharmaceutics 282 (2004) 1–18
dry spheres in an ethanol–water mixture followed by
freeze-drying. The resulting distribution is believed tobe characterized by an increase in drug concentrationtoward the center of the microspheres thus resultingin a more constant release rate. Kakish et al. (2002)
obtained a system with a relatively constant releaserate over 10(h. Their microsphere treatment methodssigniﬁcantly improved controlled release when com-pared to untreated microspheres whose drug releaserate decreases with time.
3.5. Porosity
The porosity in a system of spheres is determined
during microsphere hardening as the organic solventevaporates during preparation. As already mentionedabove,sphereporositycanbecontrolledbychangesinspherepreparationtechniqueanddifferencesinporos-ity do affect release kinetics ( Jeyanthi et al., 1996;
Yangetal.,2000 ).Thisisnoticeableinastudyby Yang
et al. (2000) where a highly porous matrix released a
drug at a considerably higher rate than its non-porouscounterpart ( Fig. 3). Other researchers also reported
thatsphereporosityaffectedthereleaseproﬁleinsim-ilar ways ( Ghaderi et al., 1996; Yuksel et al., 1996;
Chung et al., 2001 ). Therefore, when preparing mi-
crospheres, it should be kept in mind that increasingthe number of pores should increase the release rate.
Another factor related to sphere porosity is the
already mentioned initial burst effect, which corre-spondstoarapidinitialreleaseofdrugandisnormallyfollowed by relatively-controlled linear release. Thisis attributed to the leaching which occurs at the outerwall of the sphere as it becomes hydrated ( LeCorre
et al., 1994; Okada et al., 1994; Ghaderi et al., 1996 ).
This can be minimized by supporting the formationof a non-porous outer sphere skin which can be con-trolled by sphere fabrication temperature ( Yang et al.,
2000).
3.6. Size distribution
The release proﬁles are also dependent on the size
ofthemicrospheres;therateofdrugreleasewasfoundto decrease with increasing sphere size ( Narayani and
Rao, 1994, 1995; Akhtar and Lewis, 1997; Sansdrapand Moes, 1997; Bezemer et al., 2000 ). Therefore, by
mixing microspheres of different sizes it is possible

drug-loaded microsphere (in some cases only the drug) as the coreand another polymer as the outer shell.
to obtain another degree of controlling release. More
importantly, linear, zero-order kinetics are obtainableby combining the proper formulation of microspheresizes.
Narayani and Rao (1996) have combined micro-
spheres of different sizes to obtain linear release pro-ﬁles. Employing gelatin microspheres with sizes of1–35(/H9262m, they successfully achieved good zero-order
drugrelease.Inadetailedstudy, Berklandetal.(2001,
2002)have also obtained a zero-order release by mix-
ing microspheres of different sizes; sphere size waswell controlled by fabricating spheres using the spraydry technique.
3.7. Release from core-shell microspheres
Core-shell microspheres ( Fig. 7) usually refer to
spheres formed by making core units through a nor-mal preparative method, followed by the addition ofan outer layer by a dipping procedure, mixing proce-dure,oremulsionprocedure( ErmisandYuksel,1999;
Huang et al., 1999; Jones and Lyon, 2000; Lee et al.,2002; Sparnacci et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2002 ). Em-
ployment of a shell is usually meant to enhance con-trolled release and possibly reduce the effect of theinitial burst.
Huang et al. (1999) showed how dipping PLA/poly
(ethyleneglycol)(PEG)spheresintoagelatinsolutioncanenhancecontrolledrelease.Thesphereswerepre-pared from block copolymers where the PLA blockforms a hydrophobic core and the PEG block formsa hydrophilic outer layer after preparation by the sol-vent evaporation method. Spheres made from thesepolymers are highly porous and have a high burstS. Freiberg, X.X. Zhu/International Journal of Pharmaceutics 282 (2004) 1–18 11
effect. However, coating the spheres with gelatin re-
sulted in a considerable decrease in the burst effectand offers a release over a longer period of time. Thiscan be useful when the burst effect is too high.
In other studies, Pekarek et al. (1994a,b) have pre-
paredmicrospherescontaininganinnerpolyanhydridecore and an outer layer of PLA. They found that themore hydrophilic anhydride inner core is degradedinto monomers after 2 months which eventually crys-tallized and started to escape the shell after 4 months(Pekarek and Mathiowitz, 1998 ) without signiﬁcant
degradation of the shell; the spheres also had similardegradationcharacteristicsinvivoorinvitro( Pekarek
et al., 1998 ). This may be useful for the controlled re-
leaseofadruginsidethecorematrixsincethereleaserate is controlled by diffusion through a shell of uni-form thickness ( Pekarek et al., 1994a ). Along similar
linesYang et al. (2003) observed advanced degrada-
tion of the inner core of composite PEO/PLGA mi-crospheres where PEO was the inner core; the samesystems are considered as a possible release mediumfor two drugs simultaneously ( Shi et al., 2003 ).
In some cases, researchers have been able to es-
tablish targeted release by incorporating pH-sensitiveoutershells.TheeffectisshelldegradationataspeciﬁcpH values followed by rate-controlled drug release.
3.8. pH controlled release
Added control over drug delivery can be achieved
by employing pH-triggered release. Therefore by theincorporation of pH-sensitive groups, microspherescan be targeted to various biological environmentsor to speciﬁc organs ( Bilia et al., 1996; Cifti et al.,
1996; Kumar and Rao, 1997; Mi et al., 1997; Kumarand Rao, 1998; Lorenzo-Lamosa et al., 1998; Bittneret al., 1999; Carelli et al., 1999; Gupta and Kumar,2001; Jeong et al., 2001; Lynn et al., 2001 ).
Lynn et al. (2001) studied release from micro-
spheres at intercellular pH’s. They employed apoly(/H9252-amino ester) which was stable in the pH range
of 7.0–7.4 but readily solvable below pH 6.5. Veryslow release was attained at pH 7.4 but full and im-mediate release occurred at pH 5.1, suggesting a verygood material for targeted release.
In another study when a chitosan microcore was
coated with Eudragit
®(poly(methacrylic acid-co-
methylmethacrylate)) controlled release occurredonly after the pH-sensitive coating was dissolved
(Lorenzo-Lamosa et al., 1998 ). Even though chitosan
dissolves rapidly at pH 7.4, no drug was releasedfrom the microspheres until the pH of shell degra-dation was attained. Such an outer shell providesusefulness in pH-targeted release; other studies alsoemployed the acrylic Eudragit
®for pH-sensitive re-
lease (Kawashima et al., 1991; Yuksel et al., 1996;
Buonaguidietal.,1997;Lorenzo-Lamosaetal.,1997;Sriwongjanya and Bodmeier, 1997; Jeong et al.,2001).
Researchers also demonstrated that controlled re-
lease is possible for acrylamide-based microspheresystemswhicharebothpH-andtemperature-sensitive(Kim et al., 1994, 2001; Fang and Kawaguchi, 2002 ).
Temperature sensitivity arises from the lower crit-ical solution temperature (LCST), which may bepH-dependent. Below LCST the polymer is hy-drophilic due to hydrogen bonding with water, andabove the LCST the polymer becomes hydrophobicdue to the disruption of hydrogen bonds. Since theLCST is pH-dependent, Kim et al. (1994) employed
the swelling effect to ensure that a drug was releasedin the colon at a higher pH instead of the lower stom-ach pH. In the hydrophilic state, the loaded drug wasrapidly released and in the hydrophobic state, drugrelease was very slow. Using similar responsive poly-mers,Kimetal.(2001) alsostimulatedhypocortisone
release at pH 4 and halted release at pH 7.4 ( Fig. 8).
4. Some practical aspects of microspheres for
drug delivery
4.1. Applications
Micro-scale technologies have long been important
and commonplace; nano-scale technologies are alsoseeing a wider use and have direct implications tothe biomedical ﬁeld ( Grainer, 2003 ). Mueller already
provided an interesting review concerning the appli-cability of nanosuspensions for oral and intravenouspurposes ( Mueller et al., 2001 ), Vasir also provided a
relevant review concerning bioadhesive microspheres(Vasir et al., 2003 ); therefore only brief comments on
the topic will be made here.
Microspheres designed for oral treatment target
the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and encapsulation can12 S. Freiberg, X.X. Zhu/International Journal of Pharmaceutics 282 (2004) 1–18

et al. (2001) .
enhance GI treatments. Toxic drugs, which can cause
side effects when administered in large quantities, orinsoluble drugs, which may require large doses topromote absorption, can be administered with a lowerfrequency and smaller quantity ( Davis et al., 1984;
Kumar and Rao, 1998 ). The adhesion properties of
biospheres can be exploited so that they stick to theadhesive tissues thus prolonging absorption time atlower doses ( Davis et al., 1984; Ch’ng et al., 1985;
Kumar and Rao, 1998; Mueller et al., 2001; Vasiret al., 2003 ). pH-controlled release in these systems
is desirable and, as shown in this review, it is verypossible ( Kim et al., 1994; Lorenzo-Lamosa et al.,
1997; Lorenzo-Lamosa et al., 1998; Jeong et al.,2001; Zhou et al., 2002 ).
Intravenous delivery (and needle injection) has
implications pertaining to sphere particle size anddelivery can be enhanced by pH-controlled release.Particle size is of particular importance as describedin reviews by Edlund and Albertsson (2002) and
Pouton and Seymour (2001) since particles that are
too large, of the order of 6( /H9262m, can block blood cap-
illaries; in some cases sizes as small as 50–100(nmare required to reach certain organs. Monodis-perse nanospheres with transit capability throughnano-sized passages can be readily made by emul-sion or dispersion polymerization ( Reese et al., 2000;McPhee et al., 1993; Jones and Lyon, 2000;
Sparnaccietal.,2002 ).Inothercases,thedrugcanalso
be administered directly to the desired site for localand targeted release ( Deurloo et al., 1990; Liu et al.,
2001).
Targeted sensitivity is also required so that drug is
released only upon entry into a desired site. As shownearlierinthisreview,varioussystemsexistwheredrugexpulsion is retarded in the blood, pH 7.4, but is re-leased at other pH’s ( Bezemer et al., 2000; Gupta and
Kumar, 2001; Kim et al., 2001; Lynn et al., 2001;Berklandetal.,2002 ).Kim’spH-andthermo-sensitive
polyacrylamide system may also be realizable in theform of nanospheres instead of microspheres if thespheres are prepared by emulsion polymerization in-steadofsolventevaporation,whichmayeventuallybeemployable for delivery systems that can transit smallpassages ( Kim et al., 2001 ).
4.2. In vivo administration of microspheres
The use of microspheres in mammals is not a the-
oretical issue but an applied reality. Sandstrap et al.
(1999)showed how it was possible to obtain reason-
able accordance between in vitro and in vivo resultsusing of PGLA microsphere systems in rats for therelease of nifedipine.S. Freiberg, X.X. Zhu/International Journal of Pharmaceutics 282 (2004) 1–18 13
In examples representative of animal testing, Khan
et al. (2000) andChen et al. (1997) have sepa-
rately injected rats with antisense oligonucleotidesand anti-cancer agents, respectively, with promisingresults.Khan et al. (2000) employed PGLA micro-
spheres and showed that the oligonucleotides are re-leased in a controlled manner and their system causesimproved oligonucleotide distribution in the brain.Chen et al. (1997) delivered anti-cancer medication
(carboplatin) to rats in the brain and showed that themicrospheres evoked a local inﬂammatory reactionthat was well tolerated by the rats. Other studies alsoshow signiﬁcant release advantages in the use of mi-crospheres when treating brain tumors ( Eroglu et al.,
2001) and the article of Fournier et al. (2003) pro-
vided some important references on the topic. Manyin vivo studies employ PLA or PLGA microspheres(Sandstrap et al., 1999; Khan et al., 2000; Tuncay
et al., 2000; Eroglu et al., 2001; Woo et al., 2002 )
but poly(methilidine malonate) ( Fournier et al., 2003 )
and Eudragit
®(Jeong et al., 2001 ) microspheres have
also been used.
Recently, Wang et al. (2004) made microspheres
from poly(ortho-ester) for the delivery of DNA vac-cines and tested them in mice. The polymer can pre-vent the DNA from degradation and the release takesplace inside the cell where the weakly acidic environ-mentdegradesthepolymerwithoutcompromisingthebiological activity of the DNA. The diameter of thespheres was adjusted to about 5( /H9262m, a size believed
to be taken up preferentially by the cells.
Microsphere testing is also seen in humans; Katz
et al. (2003) recently obtained promising results in a
study of an orally delivered vaccine with the employ-mentofPLGAmicrospheres.Inanotherstudy,Paque-tte et al. also obtained promising results when usingmicrosphere encapsulated medication in the treatmentof gum disease.
Patents mentioning polymer microsphere systems
are also seen which shows their potential commercialimportance ( Carrasquillo and Adamis, 2003; Hanes
et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003 ).
4.3. Commercialization of microspheres
The use of microspheres for drug delivery is not
limited to any speciﬁc illness, rather they can bewidely applied to many situations where continuousand controlled drug administration is essential. How-
ever, some of references noted in this article wereperformed for the release of speciﬁc medicationsincluding: antibiotics ( Atkins et al., 1998 ), peptides
(Li et al., 1995b; Jeyanthi et al., 1997 ), proteins
(Yan et al., 1994; Bezemer et al., 2000; Yang et al.,
2000), anaesthetics ( LeCorre et al., 1994 ), anti-virals
(Schlicher et al., 1997 ), hypertension drugs ( Yuksel
et al., 1996; Guyot and Fawaz, 1998; Sansdrap et al.,1999), anti-HIV drugs( Akhtar and Lewis, 1997 ), and
anti-cancer drugs ( Deurloo et al., 1990; Narayani and
Rao, 1996; Liu et al., 2001 ).
Drug delivery is a primary topic in the biophar-
maceuticals industry and microspheres do overcomemany of the shortcomings of conventional drug de-livery routes. To date a limited number of companiesprovide commercially available microspheres and/orhaveactiveproductdevelopmentprogramsintheﬁeld.For market applications, microsphere systems are ex-pected to undergo phase and clinical testing just asnon-encapsulated drug systems. However, the use ofmaterials already approved for in vivo degradation,such as PLGs may increase their likelihood and speedof acceptance.
A typical application cited by companies man-
ufacturing and developing microspheres is for usein the treatment of cancers. Currently, an injectablepolyphosphoester microsphere is undergoing de-velopment which boasts the potential for localizedchemotherapy thus reducing adverse effects to the pa-tient. However, many companies don’t suggest a spe-ciﬁc medical ailment for which their products shouldbe used, rather they indicate that treatment doses andduration times can be modulated for the desired task.In some cases, customizable release proﬁles are evenoffered.
5. Conclusions
The controlled release of medications from poly-
mer microspheres is achievable by manipulating thephysical and chemical properties of the polymer aswell as those of the microsphere. Issues such as poly-mer molecular weight, blend composition, polymerand drug crystallinity, drug distribution, sphere poros-ity,andspheresizeallinﬂuencethereleaseproﬁleandcan be tailored to ﬁt a desired release. Extra control14 S. Freiberg, X.X. Zhu/International Journal of Pharmaceutics 282 (2004) 1–18
over microsphere release can be obtained by the ad-
dition of a pH-sensitive outer core, and/or by the em-ployment of a pH-sensitive inner shell. Microspheresprovide sustained release in localized areas and canbe employed to reduce medication doses and its fre-quency of use.
The utility and potential of microsphere drug deliv-
ery systems have been demonstrated and it has beenshown that tailored delivery is possible. Site speciﬁcapplicationswouldnormallyimplysiteinjection.Oraldelivery is also desirable for medications that are ef-fective upon intestinal absorption and can be admin-istered with microspheres that are unaffected by thestomachfollowedbyadherenceanddegradationatthecolon wall.
Many chemical and engineering questions to these
designed systems have been addressed. Furthermore,in vivo testing of speciﬁc drug/microsphere systemshas been successfully accomplished by various re-searchgroups.Broadscopeapplicationofmicrospheresystems requires testing on case-by-case studies andit may not always be clear how systems will performduring in vivo tests as compared to their controlledlaboratorycounterpartenvironments.Inparticular,thevariability of degradation environments in biologicalsystems may in some cases require the necessity ofnew innovative release triggers. Bead functionaliza-tion with chemical groups of speciﬁc reactivities mayenhance targeted speciﬁcity.
