 Abstract 26 
Microalgae are considered as one of the most promis ing sources of biomass for energy 27 
production. However, bioenergy production by microa lgal culture is still not 28 
economically viable and it has high environmental i mpact (requirement of high amount 29 
of freshwater). These drawbacks can be surpassed by  coupling microalgal biomass 30 
production with phycoremediation of wastewater. In this context, this study evaluates the 31 
kinetics of biomass production and nutrient removal  by two microalgal species ( Chlorella 32 
vulgaris  and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ) cultivated in different medium 33 
compositions.  34 
The potential of microalgae for biomass production and their high efficiency on nutrients 35 
removal from medium, particularly nitrogen and phos phorus, was demonstrated. 36 
Maximum biomass productivity was observed for C. vulgaris  (0.106±0.004 g L -1 d-1), 37 
while P. subcapitata  reached a maximum of 0.050±0.001 g L -1 d-1. The value of N:P 38 
molar ratio that favoured microalgal growth was 8:1  for C. vulgaris  and 16:1 for P. 39 
subcapitata . A complete removal (100%) of ammonium was measure d and high removal 40 
efficiencies were observed for nitrate (above 95%) and phosphate  (above 97%). 41 
Microalgae were also able to efficiently remove sul phates, presenting removal 42 
efficiencies from 54 to 100%. The removal kinetics for all the nutrients have been 43 
determined through application of pseudo-first-orde r kinetic model and modified 44 
Gompertz model. In conclusion, this work gives rele vant data for culturing microalgae in 45 
wastewater, contributing to the bioprocess design o f a sustainable and low-cost 46 
production of microalgal biomass. 47

 1. Introduction 52 
Alternative sources of energy with lower carbon int ensity and thus, more sustainable, 53 
should be studied. Biomass is a renewable energy re source that, with adequate 54 
management, can achieve high regeneration rates bei ng considered sustainable (zero- 55 
emission energy source) [1-3]. In this context, mic roalgae appear as an important source 56 
of biomass. These photosynthetic microorganisms pre sent higher growth rates and higher 57 
biomass productivities when compared to terrestrial  crops [4-8]. Microalgae can be grown 58 
in non-arable land and require far less land than t errestrial crops, thus not competing with 59 
agriculture and not compromising food production an d supply. Additionally, microalgae 60 
can grow in a wide variety of environmental conditi ons and also in low quality waters, 61 
reducing the requirements for freshwater [9, 10]. D ue to their macromolecular 62 
composition, several commercial products can be ach ieved from microalgal biomass [11]: 63 
human food, animal feed, fine chemicals, biofuels a nd fertilizers. Microalgal cultures are 64 
already performed at large-scale, mainly for high-v alued human nutritional products. 65 
However, bioenergy production is not economically v iable yet; thus, several research 66 
efforts should be performed to reduce biomass produ ction costs. Besides the search for 67 
the culture parameters corresponding to maximum gro wth rates, the process integration 68 
of biomass production with wastewater treatment (se condary or tertiary treatment) will 69 
provide a significant reduction on the requirement for freshwater and nutrients (whose 70 
price almost doubled in the last decade) [12, 13]. On the other hand, wastewater treatment 71 
using microalgae has several advantages over conven tional treatments [14-16]: (i) 72 
nitrogen and phosphorus can be converted into bioma ss without the addition of organic 73 
carbon; (ii) the discharged effluent into water bod ies is oxygenated; and (iii) high-valued 74 
products can be extracted from microalgal biomass. The main mechanisms for nutrient 75 
removal from microalgae include uptake into the cel l and, in the case of ammonia, the 76 
stripping through elevated pH [17, 18]. However, te rtiary treatment of wastewater with 77 
microalgae should guarantee that the discharge limi ts for urban wastewaters defined by 78 
the European Union (EU) Directives 91/271/EEC and 1 998/15/EC are accomplished. 79 
Taking into account the definition of population eq uivalent (p.e.) presented in the EU 80 
legislation, the limits for effluent discharge are:  (i) 2 mg P L-1 (for 10 to 100 thousand p.e.) 81 
or 1 mg P L-1 (for more than 100 thousand p.e.) for total phosph orus and a removal 82 
efficiency of this nutrient in the overall load of at least 80%; and (ii) 15 mg N L-1 (for 10 83 
to 100 thousand p.e.) or 10 mg N L-1 (for more than 100 thousand PE) for total nitrogen  84 4 
 and a removal efficiency of this nutrient in the ov erall load of at least 70-80%. One or 85 
both parameters (values for concentrations or the p ercentage of reduction) may be applied 86 
depending on the local situation.  87 
According to their source, wastewaters can present different compositions, some of them 88 
with compounds that inhibit microalgal growth. Seve ral research studies were already 89 
performed with microalgal growth in wastewaters fro m different sources: (i) domestic 90 
wastewater [19-21]; (ii) anaerobic digestion wastew ater [22-24]; (iii) livestock 91 
wastewater [25-27]; and (iv) agro-industrial wastew ater [28, 29]. In almost all studies, 92 
microalgae were able to efficiently remove the moni tored nutrients. Lundquist et al. [30] 93 
performed a techno-economic assessment of biofuel p roduction by microalgae using 94 
wastewater as culture medium, selecting five case s tudies: two of them focused on 95 
wastewater treatment and the others on biofuel (bio gas and biodiesel) production. 96 
Without integration with wastewater treatment, micr oalgal biofuels can exceed $400 per 97 
barrel, while this integration can lower the price to less than $30 per barrel. Thus, an 98 
important step to increase the competitiveness (pro moting simultaneously the 99 
environmental sustainability) of microalgal biofuel s over fossil fuels is the optimization 100 
of culture parameters using wastewater as culture m edium. 101 
Several phenomena should be studied to apply this t echnology at industrial scale. Kinetics 102 
of microalgal growth and nutrient removal are requi red to perform the bioprocess design. 103 
In addition, the influence of nitrogen to phosphoru s (N:P) molar ratio on the growth of 104 
microalgae and the effect of fed nitrogen source (n itrate or ammonium) should be 105 
analysed. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate t he kinetics of biomass production and 106 
nutrient removal of microalgae grown under differen t experimental conditions. Specific 107 
objectives were: (i) to evaluate the effect of nitr ogen to phosphorus (N:P) molar ratio and 108 
nitrogen source on the growth of two microalgae ( Chlorella vulgaris  and 109 
Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ); and (ii) to evaluate the kinetic parameters for biomass 110 
production and nutrient uptake from the culture med ium. 111 
2. Materials and methods 112 
2.1. Microorganisms and culture medium 113 
C. vulgaris  and  P. subcapitata  were obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae  and 114 
Protozoa (CCAP). The selection of these microorgani sms was based on the following 115 
factors: (i) both microorganisms can be easily grow n in laboratory cultures; (ii) different 116 5 
 studies have shown that microorganisms from the gen us Chlorella  have been effectively 117 
applied in nutrients removal from wastewaters from different sources [31-33]; and (iii) P. 118 
subcapitata  is a green microalga commonly used as a chemical t oxicity bioassay 119 
organism [34, 35] that has shown to be adapted to g row under different nitrogen and 120 
phosphorus concentrations [36]. Microalgae were ino culated in a modified standard 121 
medium [37] with the following composition (mg L -1): 12 MgCl 2·6H 2O; 18 CaCl 2·2H 2O; 122 
15 MgSO 4·7H 2O; 20 KH 2PO 4; 0.08 FeCl 3·6H 2O; 0.1 Na 2EDTA·2H 2O; 0.185 H 3BO 3; 123 
0.415 MnCl 2·4H 2O; 0.003 ZnCl 2; 0.0015 CoCl 2·6H 2O; 10 -5 CuCl 2·2H 2O; 0.007 124 
Na 2MoO 4·2H 2O and 1300 NaHCO 3. Different medium compositions regarding nitrogen 125 
(see Table 1) were applied to mimic the composition s of real effluents, which present a 126 
wide variability. NH 4Cl and NaNO 3 solutions were added at different molar ratios, to  127 
evaluate which nitrogen source (NH 4+ and NO 3-) results in an increased biomass 128 
productivity. Due to the variable composition of wa stewaters, the use of a synthetic 129 
medium was considered more appropriate to reproduce  the experiments at lab scale and 130 
to obtain mathematical models. N:P molar ratio is a n important parameter in microalgal 131 
growth. Redfield ratio (16:1) was considered as mid dle value. Two additional ratios were 132 
selected, one higher (24:1) and one lower (8:1), to  cover a wide range of values found in 133 
different wastewaters [38]: (i) poultry; (ii) swine ; (iii) tannery and others. In addition, the 134 
selected concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus are in the same order of magnitude of 135 
the values found in the same wastewaters [38]. 136 
2.2. Experimental setup and culture conditions 137 
Microalgae were inoculated in 1-L borosilicate glas s flasks with an initial biomass 138 
concentration of approximately 20-30 mg L -1. Cultures were performed at room 139 
temperature for 12 days using the above described m edium. Agitation of the cultures was 140 
obtained by injection of atmospheric air at the bas e of the flasks, using air pumps Trixie 141 
TARP D-2463 (50-300 L) with an air flow of 90 L h-1. Cultures were exposed to 142 
continuous light supply (provided by a set of four 18-W fluorescent lamps) with light 143 
intensity at the surface of the flasks between 2.5 and 3.0 klux. Light intensity was daily 144 
monitored using a light meter Isotech Lux-1335 – RS  Components. The assays were 145 
performed in duplicates. 146 
2.3. Analytical methods 147 6 
 The cultures were subjected to daily measurements o f temperature, dissolved oxygen 148 
concentration (sensor Oxi 340i – WTW), pH (sensor p H 212 – Hanna Instruments) and 149 
optical density at 750 nm (OD 750 ). OD 750  was measured using a spectrophotometer 150 
(Genesys 10S UV-Vis Scanning – Thermo Scientific). Biomass concentration was then 151 
calculated using the determined calibration curves for each microalga. The relationship 152 
between biomass dry weight (g biomass  L-1, ) and optical density (OD 750 , ) was estimated 153 
using the following linear regressions:  = (1.80 ± 0.08) + (0.04 ± 0.07)  (R 2=0.998; 154 
limits of quantification and detection were 0.15 an d 0.04 g L -1, respectively) for C. 155 
vulgaris  and  = (2.6 ± 0.2) + (0.1 ± 0.1)  (R 2=0.995; limits of quantification and 156 
detection were 0.16 and 0.05 g L -1, respectively) for P. subcapitata .  157 
To evaluate the temporal variation of the medium ch emical composition, five samples 158 
were collected in different days. These samples wer e centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4000 159 
rpm using a centrifuge by Hitachi Himac CT6E Koki C o., LMT and filtered through 160 
syringe filters of nylon membrane with a pore size of 0.45 μm (Acrodisc ®, Pall). The 161 
filtered solution was then analysed taking into acc ount the following compounds: (i) 162 
sulphate, chloride, nitrate, phosphate and nitrite measured by ion chromatography using 163 
a Dionex ICS-2100 apparatus equipped with a IonPac ® AS11-HC (4×250 mm) column 164 
at 30 ºC and an anion self-regenerating suppressor (ASRS ® 300, 4 mm) under isocratic 165 
elution of 30 mM NaOH at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min -1; (ii) sodium, potassium, 166 
ammonium, magnesium and calcium measured by ion chr omatography using a Dionex 167 
DX-120 device equipped with a IonPac ® CS12A (4×250 mm) column at room 168 
temperature and a cation self-regenerating (CSRS ® Ultra II, 4 mm) suppressor under 169 
isocratic elution of 20 mM methanesulfonic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min -1; and (iii) 170 
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration determ ined by combustion catalytic 171 
oxidation at 680 °C and non-dispersive infrared (ND IR) methods in a TOC-V CSN  analyser 172 
equipped with an ASI-V autosampler (Shimadzu). Tota l dissolved carbon (TDC) and 173 
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were also measured  and DOC was given by the 174 
difference between TDC and DIC (DOC=TDC-DIC). 175 
2.4. Kinetic models and parameters  176 
Biomass concentration ( X, g L -1) was used to determine specific growth rate ( μ, d -1) and 177 
biomass productivity ( Px, g L -1 d-1) for both species in the different studied conditi ons. 178 
During the exponential growth phase, the specific g rowth rate was calculated according 179 
to Equation 1 [39, 40]: 180 7 
  
 = ⇔=  (⁄)
− (1) 
where X1 and X0 are the biomass concentrations at time t1 and t0 (for this purpose, the end 181 
and beginning of exponential growth phase), respect ively. Biomass productivity results 182 
from the difference in biomass concentration per un it time between two consecutive 183 
samples: 184 
=−
− (2)  
To compare this parameter among different cultures,  maximum and average 185 
productivities ( Px max  and Px av , respectively) were determined. Maximum productivi ty 186 
was calculated by rolling average of three consecut ive values throughout the culture, 187 
considering the maximum value. The average producti vity results from the ratio of overall 188 
produced biomass and elapsed time [41].  189 
Regarding nutrient removal by microalgae, the remov al efficiency ( RE , %) was defined 190 
as: 191 
  (%)=!−!"
!×100  (3) 
where  S0 and Sf are nutrient concentrations at the beginning and e nd of culture, 192 
respectively. In addition, removal rate ( RR, mg L -1 d-1) of the analysed nutrients was 193 
calculated as follows: 194 
 =!−!$
$− (4) 
where  Si is the nutrient concentration at time ti. In this work, the maximum and average 195 
values of this parameter for each culture were calc ulated.  196 
A pseudo-first-order kinetic model was assumed to d escribe the temporal variation of 197 
nutrient concentrations in the cultures [40]. Accor dingly, nutrient removal kinetics can be 198 
considered as: 199

Equation 5 can be linearized to determine the kinet ic constant ( k, d -1). A plot of ln(S)  as 200 
a function of t will yield a straight line with slope –k.  201 8 
  (!)= (!)−)  (6) 
The kinetic constant helps to identify the conditio ns where higher removal rates were 202 
obtained. 203 
Based on the experimental data achieved in this wor k, it was observed that NO 3- was not 204 
immediately assimilated by microalgae in some cultu res. Therefore, the modified 205 
Gompertz model was applied to model the temporal va riation of nutrient concentrations 206 
for those cultures [42, 43]. This model considered three distinct phases: (i) initial phase 207 
of adaptation (lag phase); (ii) exponential phase; and (iii) final stage of stagnation. It can 208 
be expressed as: 209 
!=*∙%, -−%, (.−/ )0 (7) 
where * is the upper asymptote, . (. > 0) sets the displacement along the -axis and / 210 
(/ > 0) sets the tangent at the inflection point. Taking into account that the nutrient 211 
removal follows a pseudo-first-order kinetic model,  the following equation can be 212 
obtained [44]: 213 
!()=!+2!"−!3∗%, 5−%, -)∗(6−)+107 (8) 
where 6 (d) is the lag time. The fitting of the modified G ompertz model to experimental 214 
data allows the estimation of the time delay taken by microalgae to assimilate NO 3- in 215 
some cultures and the kinetic constant ( k). 216 
Biomass yield based on nutrient consumption ( Y, g biomass  gnutrient -1) can be calculated by 217 
Equation 9. This parameter was calculated for NH 4+, NO 3-, PO 43- and SO 42-. 218

3. Results and discussion 219 
Cultures of C. vulgaris  and P. subcapitata  were monitored taking into account the dual 220 
role of microalgae: biomass production and nutrient  removal from the synthetic effluent. 221 
The achieved results are important in the design of  bioreactors for the above referred 222 
applications. 223 
3.1. Biomass production 224 9 
 The daily monitoring of biomass concentration in th e different cultures allowed the 225 
characterization of their growth kinetics and analy sis of the influence of nitrogen source 226 
and concentration in the medium (corresponding to d ifferent N:P molar ratio). Figure 1 227 
shows the temporal variation of biomass concentrati on for C. vulgaris (Fig. 1a and 1c) 228 
and P. subcapitata (Figure 1b and 1d), for the tested N:P molar ratios  and nitrogen sources 229 
(assays 1, 3, 4 and 6). In general, the cultures of  C. vulgaris  presented the same growth 230 
behaviour: (i) the lack of an adaptation phase was observed; (ii) the exponential phase 231 
started before completing the first day of culture;  and (iii) microalgal growth stabilized 232 
after the seventh day. On the other hand, P. subcapitata  presented a shorter exponential 233 
phase (96 h for C. vulgaris  and 72 h for P. subcapitata ). Table 2 presents the main kinetic 234 
parameters ( Xmax , µ, Px max  and Px av ) determined for the different microalgal cultures.  235 
Concerning Xmax , these values ranged between 0.19±0.04 and 0.71±0. 02 g L -1. C. vulgaris  236 
presented higher values (0.622±0.002 to 0.71±0.02 g  L -1), when compared to P. 237 
subcapitata  (0.19±0.04 to 0.289±0.002 g L -1). Maximum values were obtained for the 238 
N:P molar ratios 16:1 and 24:1. C. vulgaris  presented specific growth rates between 239 
0.55±0.03 and 0.85±0.05 d-1, while P. subcapitata  reached higher values (0.57±0.02 to 240 
1.2±0.1 d-1). These results are in agreement with several rese arch studies that presented 241 
specific growth rates between 0.31 and 1.5 d -1 for C. vulgaris [41, 45, 46] and between 242 
0.635 and 1.44 d -1 for P. subcapitata [46-48]. Concerning N:P molar ratio and the fed 243 
nitrogen source, C. vulgaris  presented higher specific growth rates when both N H 4+ and 244 
NO 3- were present in the medium with N:P molar ratio of  8:1 (assay 2), while P. 245 
subcapitata  presented higher specific growth rates when cultur ed in the medium 246 
containing only NH 4+ with N:P molar ratio of 16:1 (assay 4). Hadj-Romdh ane et al. [49] 247 
and Kapdan and Aslan [50] evaluated the influence o f N:P molar ratio on C. vulgaris  248 
growth and both concluded that it should be near 8: 1. These results show that the Redfield 249 
ratio [51] (N:P = 16:1) was not the optimal value f or the growth of C. vulgaris , but it was 250 
the optimal one for P. subcapitata growth. A more recent study developed predictive 251 
models to determine the best N:P molar ratio [52]. This value can vary from 8.2 to 45.0, 252 
depending on the experimental conditions. The same research study considered that the 253 
Redfield ratio is an average of the values achieved  for the different species. Px av  values 254 
indicate the average temporal rate of biomass produ ction in the cultures. However, in 255 
industrial context, microalgal cultures should be p erformed in continuous mode during 256 
the exponential growth phase, when high biomass pro ductivities are achieved ( Px max ). 257 
Thus, these values should be focused on the analysi s of the optimal culture conditions. C. 258 10 
 vulgaris  achieved values between 0.077±0.001 and 0.106±0.00 4 g L -1 d-1 that were 259 
significantly higher than P. subcapitata  (0.033±0.001 to 0.050±0.001 g L -1 d-1). Despite 260 
having lower specific growth rates, C. vulgaris  achieved higher biomass concentrations 261 
and higher productivities (due to the longer durati on of their exponential growth phase – 262 
96 h) than P. subcapitata , thus showing higher potential for biomass product ion.  263 
Besides the monitoring of biomass concentration in the different cultures, three other 264 
culture parameters were daily monitored: (i) pH; (i i) temperature; and (iii) dissolved 265 
oxygen concentration. Table 3 shows the average val ues and standard deviations of these 266 
culture variables for all assays. Temporal variatio n profiles were very similar for all 267 
cultures. The initial value of pH was 8.2±0.2, whic h increased in the first day of culture 268 
to 9.6±0.2 for C. vulgaris  and 9.4±0.2 for P. subcapitata , then presenting a slight decrease 269 
tendency until the end of the cultures. The observe d increase occurred at the beginning of 270 
the exponential growth phase. In autotrophic growth , microalgae uptake dissolved CO 2, 271 
which leads to a pH rise and a new chemical equilib rium in the medium is then 272 
established. In the remaining days of culture, no s ignificant pH change was observed; 273 
thus, CO 2 uptake rate by microalgae was equal to gas-to-liqu id mass transfer rate of this 274 
compound. On the other hand, temperature did not pr esent significant variation (not 275 
controlled variable), being equal to 25±1 ºC. Regar ding dissolved oxygen concentration, 276 
an increase was expected due to the photosynthetic activity of microalgae. Thus, this 277 
variable should have similar behaviour than the one  observed for culture pH. Cultures of 278 
C. vulgaris  showed higher values, presenting an increase in th e first day of culture from 279 
6.7±0.4 mg L -1 to 7.9±0.3 mg L -1 and showing a slight decrease until the end of cul ture 280 
with final value of 7.2±0.1 mg L -1. High dissolved oxygen concentrations may have a 281 
negative effect on the growth of microalgae. Howeve r, air bubbling promotes the removal 282 
of photosynthetic produced oxygen from the cultures , avoiding the negative impact of 283 
excessive concentrations of dissolved oxygen. In th e case of P. subcapitata , no significant 284 
variations in this variable were observed for all c ultures, due to their low biomass 285 
concentration.  286 
3.2. Nutrient uptake 287 
The value of N:P molar ratio is considered as one o f the most important parameters for 288 
nutrient removal in biological treatment systems. L imitation in one of these important 289 
nutrients may reduce the removal of other nutrients  [38]. In this study, the influence of 290 
N:P molar ratio and nitrogen source on nutrient upt ake by microalgae was analysed. 291 11 
 Besides the monitoring of biomass concentration, pH , temperature and dissolved oxygen 292 
concentration, culture samples were collected in fi ve time periods to evaluate the 293 
chemical composition of the medium, taking into acc ount the following nutrients: (i) 294 
carbon (DIC and DOC); (ii) nitrogen (NH 4+ and NO 3-); (iii) phosphorus; and (iv) sulphur.  295 
3.2.1. Carbon 296 
Microalgae can use organic or inorganic forms of ca rbon. In this study, culture medium 297 
only contained soluble carbonates (HCO 3-) that were assimilated by microalgae, as well 298 
as the atmospheric carbon dioxide that was injected  to the cultures to promote their 299 
mixing. However, organic and inorganic carbon were analysed in all cultures, showing a 300 
similar behaviour for all studied conditions. Figur e 2 shows, as example, the temporal 301 
variation of DIC (Figure 2a and 2b) and DOC (Figure  2c and 2d) concentrations for the 302 
assays 2 ( C. vulgaris , Figure 2a and 2c) and 5 ( P. subcapitata , Figure 2b and 2d) for all 303 
tested N:P molar ratios. These temporal profiles ar e representative for all cultures. DIC 304 
concentration decreased in the first days about 20- 40 mg L -1 (approximately 10%). This 305 
decrease occurred in the beginning of exponential g rowth phase, in which a pH increase 306 
was also observed. On the other hand, DOC concentra tion increased to 15±2 mg L -1 for 307 
C. vulgaris  and 31±2 mg L -1 for P. subcapitata  during the same time period. The presence 308 
of organic forms of carbon can be justified by comp ounds produced and excreted by 309 
microalgae [53-55]. Hulatt and Thomas [55] determin ed the amount of dissolved organic 310 
matter exuded by microalgae, achieving the values o f 6.4% and 17.3% of the total organic 311 
carbon in the cultures of C. vulgaris  and Dunaliella tertiolecta , respectively. In this study, 312 
this percentage was about 2.3% for C. vulgaris  and 12% for P. subcapitata . 313 
3.2.2. Nitrogen 314 
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for all organisms . Microalgae require this nutrient to 315 
produce important biological substances, such as pr oteins, chlorophylls, energy transfer 316 
molecules (ADP and ATP) and genetic materials (RNA and DNA). In this study, 317 
microalgal cultures were prepared with different co ncentrations of N-NH 4+ and N-NO 3-, 318 
aiming the analysis of the effect of N:P molar rati o on nutrient removal kinetics. In 319 
addition, cultures were also performed using both n itrogen sources (assays 2 and 5), to 320 
evaluate which one (N-NH 4+ or N-NO 3-) improves biomass productivities. In these 321 
assays, the culture medium had the same molar conce ntration of N-NH 4+ and N-NO 3-. 322 
Table 4 shows the removal kinetic parameters and ef ficiencies of N-NH 4+ and N-NO 3- for 323 12 
 all assays. Regarding N-NH 4+, microalgal cultures presented removal efficiencie s of 324 
100% (values achieved in less than 48 h of culture) . The highest removal rate was 13.92 325 
mg N L-1 h-1, achieved by P. subcapitata  in the first day of culture with the highest N-NH 4+ 326 
concentration. The kinetic constant ( k) varied between 0.5±0.1 and 3.86±0.05 d-1, being 327 
the highest value achieved for N:P molar ratio of 8 :1 for both microalgae. Lower 328 
concentrations of this nutrient in the culture medi um may induce the increase of removal 329 
kinetics by microalgae. This effect took more relev ance for C. vulgaris , in which 330 
significant differences in removal kinetic constant s were achieved for different N:P molar 331 
ratios in assay 1 (corresponding to the highest con centration of ammonia). In the case of 332 
P. subcapitata , the increase of removal kinetics with the decreas e of N:P molar ratio was 333 
only significant in assay 5 (corresponding to the l owest concentration of ammonia). Thus, 334 
the results showed that C. vulgaris  requires higher nitrogen concentrations in culture  335 
medium than P. subcapitata . Different values can be found in literature for k inetic 336 
constant of N-NH 4+ uptake by microalgae: (i) 0.05-0.16 d -1 (Chlorella  sp. and 337 
Micractinium  sp.) [40]; and (ii) 2.5 d -1 (C. vulgaris ) [56]. Concerning the yield of biomass 338 
based on ammonium consumption, the highest values w ere also obtained for all cultures 339 
with N:P molar ratio of 8:1. 340 
Table 4 also shows the removal efficiency and kinet ics of N-NO 3-. Both microalgae were 341 
able to efficiently uptake this nutrient, presentin g removal efficiencies above 95%. All 342 
microalgal cultures fulfilled the limit defined by EU legislation for nitrogen concentration 343 
in discharged effluents (10 mg N L-1). The removal rates increased with the increase of  344 
initial NO 3- concentration. The maximum values occurred in cult ures with N:P molar ratio 345 
of 16:1 for C. vulgaris  and 24:1 for P. subcapitata . Analysing the temporal variation of 346 
N-NO 3- concentration in assays 2 and 5 (cultures also hav ing N-NH 4+ in medium 347 
composition), this value did not change significant ly in the beginning of cultivation time 348 
(see Figure 3). For these cultures, the modified Go mpertz model was applied to describe 349 
the evolution of N-NO 3- concentration in the microalgal cultures. The obse rved delay of 350 
N-NO 3- uptake showed that these species prefer N-NH 4+ rather than N-NO 3-. These results 351 
were expected since N-NH 4+ is directly assimilated by microalgae, whereas N-N O 3- 352 
requires the previous reduction of N-NO 3- into N-NH 4+ [38, 57]. In addition, this delay 353 
increases with the increase of the initial N-NH 4+ concentration, taking more relevance in 354 
cultures of C. vulgaris  (maximum delay of 3.26±0.05 d) comparing to P. subcapitata  355 
(maximum delay of 1.5±0.6 d). For assays 3 and 6 (o nly N-NO 3- as nitrogen source), the 356 13 
 nutrient uptake follows a pseudo-first-order kineti c equation. Higher kinetic constants 357 
were obtained for lower N-NO 3- concentrations (N:P molar ratio of 8:1). This beha viour 358 
was observed for both species. Despite the high rem oval efficiencies, kinetic constants of 359 
N-NO 3- removal were lower than the ones achieved by Ruiz et al. [56] (1.4-1.7 d -1). 360 
Moreover, these values were also lower than the N-N H 4+ uptake rates obtained in this 361 
work. This phenomenon is justified by the mechanism  adopted by microalgae to 362 
assimilate different nitrogen sources. Biomass yiel ds based on nitrogen consumption for 363 
C. vulgaris  and P. subcapitata  decreased with the increase of N:P molar ratio. C. vulgaris  364 
presented higher biomass yields than P. subcapitata  for both nitrogen sources: (i) 13.5- 365 
37.9 g biomass  gN-1 (assay 1 – C. vulgaris , N-NH 4+) and 4.8-12.5 g biomass  gN-1 (assay 4 – P. 366 
subcapitata,  N-NH 4+); and (ii) 13.2-35.5 g biomass  gN-1 (assay 3 – C. vulgaris , N-NO 3-) and 367 
11.4-22.0  gbiomass  gN-1 (assay 6 – P. subcapitata,  N-NO 3-). Biomass yields achieved with 368 
N-NH 4+ in assay 4 were very low. For example, the value 4. 8 g biomass  gN-1 corresponds 369 
to a percentage of nitrogen in biomass of about 20% . This value is usually 6.8-12.4% 370 
[58]. These results indicate that ammonia stripping might  have occurred. This 371 
phenomenon has high probability of occurrence with pH values higher than 8 (which 372 
was verified for all cultures). 373 
3.2.3. Phosphorus 374 
Phosphorus is one of the key elements for microalga l growth, as it is used in the energy 375 
metabolism, playing an important role on cell growt h [38]. Microalgae preferably uptake 376 
the inorganic forms H 2PO 4- and HPO 42-. In addition, microalgae have a second 377 
mechanism for phosphorus removal, called luxury upt ake. Luxury uptake is the storage 378 
of phosphorus within the biomass in the form of pol yphosphates [59, 60]. Table 5 shows 379 
the phosphorus (P-PO 43-) removal efficiencies and kinetic parameters. Micr oalgal 380 
cultures presented high removal efficiencies, achie ving phosphorus concentrations below 381 
the limit defined by EU legislation (1 mg P L-1). Maximum removal rates were in the range 382 
of 0.48-2.61 mg P L-1 d-1. Temporal variation of its concentration was simil ar in all 383 
cultures, following the tendency described by pseud o-first-order kinetic equation. 384 
Applying this kinetic model, the maximum phosphorus  uptake rates were obtained in the 385 
assays 2 and 5 (corresponding to cultures of C. vulgaris  and P. subcapitata , respectively), 386 
when both nitrogen sources were present in the cult ure medium. The achieved kinetic 387 
constants were in the same order of magnitude than the ones presented by Wang et al. 388 
[40] (0.17-0.32 d -1), but significantly lower than those presented by Ruiz et al. [56] (2.0- 389 14 
 3.2 d -1). Higher values obtained in the last study are jus tified by the feed of CO 2 at higher 390 
concentrations (5%) when compared with this study, which promoted microalgal growth 391 
and, consequently, nutrient removal from the cultur e medium using atmospheric CO 2 392 
concentrations. Biomass yields based on phosphorus consumption did not vary 393 
significantly in cultures of C. vulgaris  (130.2-150.2 g biomass  gP-1). Cultures of P. 394 
subcapitata  presented higher biomass yields (between 37.0 and 59.8 g biomass  gP-1) for 395 
higher N:P molar ratios. These values showed that t he mass percentages of phosphorus 396 
in C. vulgaris  are lower (0.67-0.77%) than those in P. subcapitata  (1.7-2.7%). These 397 
results suggest that P. subcapitata  may remove phosphorus by luxury uptake, as they 398 
contain a percentage of phosphorus greater than 1% [59]. This removal mechanism may 399 
take more importance in the media with lower N:P mo lar ratio, in which higher 400 
phosphorus mass concentrations were achieved. 401 
3.2.4. Sulphur 402 
The consumption of sulphur was significantly lower than other studied nutrients. Table 6 403 
shows the sulphur (S-SO 42-) removal efficiencies and kinetic parameters. C. vulgaris  404 
presented higher removal efficiencies (75-100%) whe n compared with P. subcapitata  405 
(54-92%). The removal rates did not significantly v ary in the different cultures, presenting 406 
a maximum of 0.821 mg S L-1 d-1. The analysis of temporal variation of S-SO 42- 407 
concentration in the medium was also performed by f itting the pseudo-first-order kinetic 408 
equation to the experimental results. The kinetic c onstants were in the range of 409 
0.139±0.005 to 0.42±0.03 d-1. Biomass yields based on sulphur consumption were 410 
between 338.0 and 397.1 g biomass  gS-1 for C. vulgaris  and between 93.3 and 207.9 g biomass  411 
gS-1 for P. subcapitata . 412 
4. Conclusions 413 
This study showed the potential of C. vulgaris  and P. subcapitata  for biomass production 414 
and simultaneous nutrient removal from a synthetic effluent. Regarding biomass 415 
production, C. vulgaris  led to higher biomass concentrations and higher pr oductivities 416 
than P. subcapitata , showing higher potential for biomass production. The value of N:P 417 
molar ratio that favoured microalgal growth was 8:1  for C. vulgaris  and 16:1 for P. 418 
subcapitata . Taking into account these results and typical com positions of different 419 
wastewaters, it can be concluded that C. vulgaris can be grown in wastewaters from the 420 
dairy and swine industries and in anaerobic digesti on effluents from dairy manure, 421 15 
 whereas P. subcapitata can be grown in poultry wastewaters. The nutrient u ptake by 422 
microalgae from the culture medium was also analyse d, focusing inorganic carbon, 423 
nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), phosphorus and sul phur. Inorganic carbon presented 424 
only a slightly decrease (about 10%) in the first d ay of the cultures. Both microalgae 425 
efficiently removed nitrogen and phosphorus from th e medium (almost all cultures 426 
presented removal efficiencies above 95%). Higher u ptake rates were determined for 427 
ammonium, which complete removal from culture mediu m was observed at the second 428 
day of culture. The cultures fed with both nitrogen  sources (ammonium and nitrate) 429 
showed that ammonium was preferably assimilated by  C. vulgaris . The removal 430 
efficiencies of sulphates were significantly lower,  presenting values between 54 and 431 
100%. Thus, both microalgae showed high potential f or nutrient removal from 432 
wastewater, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, accompl ishing the limits defined by EU 433 
legislation. Thus, microalgal culture using wastewa ter as culture medium lowers the cost 434 
of biomass production, improving the economic compe titiveness of microalgae-based 435 
products.  436
