Abstract:  Dyes are typically existing in trace masses in the preserved wastes of numerous 
manufactures. The adsorption efficiency  for dye elimination from unwanted water bodies has made it a 
perfect substitute to further exclusive usage procedures. The emission holding the poisonous cationic 
dyes from the textile industries is an intimidating issue today due to ecological ratifications and their 
opposing effect on human biology. Dyes removes from the industrial wastewater overflows effectually 
detached by consuming adsorbent , such as stimulated carbon, though its price limits large -measure 
submissions. The re moval of dyes from the water is very important in demand to diminish the toxic 
effects on nature .

1. Introduction  
Dyes are the most important industrial contaminants and water pollutants [1]. 
Numerous industries discharge dyes into effluent, thus fouling the water supply. Relevant 
companies are fabric industries, dye producing industries, tanneries, paper , and pulp mills, 
distilleries, electroplating factories, food businesses, etc . [2]. The textile industrial 
corporation's entire dye utilization is more than 10,000 tons/year , with an estimated 90% in the 
fabrics industry  worldwide. It is described that aro und 100 tons of dyes are released into 
unwanted rivulet by the fabric industry per year [3]. Dye manufacturers and users are focused  
on the steadiness and celerity of dyes and, subsequently, manufactures dyes that are hard to 
eradicate from wastewater afte r usage. The elimination of color from wastewater can be 
achieve d by chemical coagulation, flotation, adsorption , and chemical oxidation [4, 5]. 
Adsorption grip promise in dealing with effluent as it is purely planned, convenient, and give 
sludge -free clea n-up operation. AC (granular or powdered) is the utmost broadly utilized 
adsorbent because it has admirable adsorption productivity for carbon -based compounds. But 
economically handy AC is costly. Furthermore, renewal using solutions manufactured by 
https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  568 minor supplementary effluents, while renewal by rebellious procedure give s rise to 10 -15% 
loss of adsorbents and its absorption range [6]. Different construction stages occur using these 
procedures, like textile fabrication, wool formation, cloth formation,  and moist processing. 
Artificial dyes cause widespread health threats when they counter with additional  chemical 
compounds and produce non -degradable secondary products. Scholars have described the 
occurrence of sulfur, soaps, nitrates, enzymes, vat dyes, naph thol, acetic acid, nitrates, 
chromium compounds, and heavy metals like lead, nickel, arsenic, copper, cadmium, mercury, 
cobalt, and fixed secondary element s to give rise to lethal effects [7]. Organic constituents like 
formaldehyde -based dye fixing agents,  hydrocarbon -based softeners, non -biodegradable 
dyeing chemicals, chlorinated stain removers are cancer -causing. The sewage discharg e from 
textile dyeing industries is poisonous, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic chemical  
components [8]. Hence, deco lorization of dyes is a significant feature  of effluent treatment  
before  release. It is tough to eliminate the sewage dyes  since dyes are not efficiently 
biodegradable and not eliminated from drain water by conventional drain water systems [9]. 
Usually, or ganic aerobic wastewater methodology is not effective for the decolorization of 
popular dyes. Thus, for the purposed of accomplishing  the estimated degree of treatment, it is 
needed to mix physical, chemical , and biological procedures as ultra -filtration, photo -
oxidation, electrochemical adsorption , and coagulation [10]. Numerous employees have also 
tried water treatment of dyes by adso rption over economic resources [11 –17]. Separately each 
system has its specific rewards and drawbacks. For example, in separation, low -molecular -
weight dyes can go through the filter system , and the usage of charcoal precisely has high waste 
disposal cost and is easy to use.  Though, the removal of poisonous slush has a serious 
disadvantage in exceeding procedures. The ozone treatment  is expensive. Progressive 
oxidation procedures based on photocatalytic deprivation presently exist  for the active 
oxidation of various  organic compounds and colorants [18,  19]. The c apability of the 
photocatalytic procedure to entirely damage organic compounds into CO 2 and water, devoid of 
producing some detrimental by -products, has built up its role as a wastewater sterilizer. The 
methodology has been broadly working for the photo -mineralization of a great numeral of 
colorants like azo dyes, acid and direct dyes, react ive black & methylene blue [20]. Numerous 
biological, chemical , and physical methods such as photolysis, adsorption, electrochemical 
precipitation, chemical oxidation and reduction, chemical precipitation have been used for the 
exclusion of dyes from waste water [21 -23]. However, these methodologies are generally not 
effective in dye elimination or are costly and less adjustable to wide -ranging dye-containing 
wastewaters [ 21, 24, 25]. dye is one of the most significant water quality parameters. 
Throughout th e dying method, about 5 - 20% of the dye are vanished due to its incomplete 
adsorption on the fibers [26]. Dyes are mass -produced to have high chemical resistance because 
they are usually chemical species that are very hard to damage (aromatic dyes). Moreo ver, dye 
solutions generally contain antifungal agents and antibacterial, which are used to give the fibers 
more resistance to biological deprivation [27]. Even at moderately low concentrations, the 
intense colo r related to the dye affects the transparency  of water and aesthetics, thus interfering 
in photosynthesis  and the solubilization of smokes in river s, lakes, and other surface water 
bodies. It harms both the water fauna and flora. Also, colored effluents may carry significant 
quantities of toxic compo unds, particularly azo dyes, that are known to be vastly carcinogenic 
[28, 29]. Among the several  manufacturing sectors in India , the textile and garments industries 
are one of the oldest , and in the Indian economy , these industries play a significant role. It is 
an important supplier to much national financial prudence, including small  and large -scale https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  569 procedures worldwide. the textile industry is t he topmost manufacturing industry globally in 
terms of its results, employment,  and gross dome stic production. The textile industry is the 
main foreign exchange earner after agriculture. Textile industry major proprietor with a n 
overall workforce of 35 mn. The textile industry enclosed a diverse variety of events, which 
contain the manufacture of n atural crude resources like spun yarn, jute, wool, cotton & silk , 
and artificial fiber. additionally, a wide variety of finished products are made. For textile fibers 
and yarns, India accounts for about 14% of the world’s production. This contains jute, of  which 
it is the topmost manufacturer. India is the subsequent major manufacturer of fiber, cellulose, 
yarn, and silk fiber and the fifth main manufacturer of synthetic yarn and fiber [30]. the main 
impurities present in the wastewater are acids and bases,  organic and inorganic solid materials, 
coloring agents. lignin and tannin are the dyeing agents which give shade to the fabric. Coloring 
principally contains the usage of colorants under suitable environments to yield stained fabrics. 
on the other hand, l ithography contains the usage of colorants to a limited part of the fabric that 
is nominated for applying the abstract of the proposal. Last procedures include waterproofing, 
softening , and cross -linking , but all these stages lead to water pollution.  With these operation s, 
diverse manufacturing stages are present, like fabric and yarn formation, wet manufacturing,  
and textile production. Artificial dyes cause rampant health hazards when they counter with 
some other chemical compounds and form non -biodegrada ble secondary products. Scholars 
have described the occurrence of chromium compounds, sulfur, enzymes, naphthol, soaps, vat 
dyes, acetic acid, nitrates , and heavy metals like cobalt, nickel, copper, lead, cadmium, arsenic, 
mercury, and firm auxiliary chemi cals to produce lethal impacts. Organic material s like 
formaldehyde -based dye fixing agents, chlorinated dye removers, hydrocarbon -based 
softeners, non -biodegradable dying chemical s are cancer -causing. Effluents discharge d from 
fabric dying industries are lethal are teratogenic mutagenic a nd consist  of cancer -causing 
chemicals [31 -35]. 
2. Hazards Dye waste of Water Pollution  
Large amounts of water are used in the textile industry during procedures ; hence , it is 
one of the major industrial liquid waste producers  (ILW) [36]. The ILW formed by the textile 
industry is categorized by a high content of impurities such as heavy metals, colorants , and 
organic and inorganic material [37]. Therefore, it is essential to find a suitabl e method for ILW 
that permits the reuse of treated water as th is would allow decreasing  water utilization in the 
textile industry. In the treated effluents of many industries , colorants are occur ring in small 
quantit ies. The efficiency of adsorption for eliminating  dye from wastewaters has made it a 
supreme substitute to some other costly treatment methodologies. The research explores the 
significant usage of coconut husk (CH)  for eliminating  Quinoline Yellow dye from effluent , 
and its proficiency in colora nt sorption was linked with activated carbon (AC). Group 
adsorption research  was carried out due to  primary dye concentration, adsorption dose, pH, 
particle size, temperature , and contact time. The adsorption of quinoline yellow onto both the 
adsorbents, C H & AC, was initiate to progress with finer mesh size and increase in adsorbent 
dosage. Maximal adsorption was detected at lower pH 2.5 in pH values ranging from 2.5 to 9.1 
for both the adsorbents. It was detected that with increasing temperature , the rate  of adsorption 
increases for AC , and the method is endothermic , while in the case of CH, with increasing 
temperature rate of adsorption decreases with indicating that the method is exothermic [38]. 
Pollution of the water sources is triggered by releases fr om manufacturing processes which has 
become a troublesome spectacle because of its effect on ecological wellness and care. Fabric https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  570 trades subsidize hugely to surface river damaging and are classified amongst the prime 
contaminating of all manufacturing area s [39]. Runoffs from cloth productions are multifaceted 
combinations of elements differing in quality and quantity. These companies can produce 
organic & inorganic wastages combined with effluents from the manufacturing procedures that 
result  in changes  in both chemical and biological limits of the receiving water sources [40].  
 
Figure 1. Graphical representation of impacts of fabric wastages released in the environment . 
Fabric effluents produced from distinct phases of fabric procedure encompass many  
contaminants that are destructive to the ecosystem if free the pollutants without a suitable 
method [30]. The amount of ecological effluence due to dye by water which is used  for the 
bath, is very high [ 41, 42]. Ecological contamination triggered by the proclamation of many  
azo dyes through industrial effluent is an important issue to current daytime [43]. There are 
great records of chemical and mechanical methods used in the fabric business, and individual 
procedures have  a distinct effect on the ecosystem. The occurrence of dyes, nitrates, sulfur, 
acetic acid, soaps, naphthol, vat dyes, heavy metallic element s like nickel, cadmium, copper, 
mercury, cobalt, arsenic , and lead, certain auxiliary chemicals , and chromium compounds all 
together makes the sewage extremely poisonous. The factory seepage is also frequently of a 
high pH and temperature, both of which are tremendously detrimental [44]. Likewise, dye 
collection  hampers sunlight perforation, a disorder in the collecting water environment  [45,46]. 
The ecological contamination begun by fabric wastewater sewage shows a worldwide risk to 
community wellness , and it bring s out innovative creativities for conservational  renovation for 
both ecological and economic causes. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government 
of India , has placed the textile industry in the  utmost contaminating industries [47].  Pigments 
and dyes are one of the biggest water contaminants and , if not released appropriately , give rise 
to environmental disruption. Considering  this, the recent study examines the use of thermal 
power plant by -product s, i.e., fly ash , to remove  a harmful methylene blue dye from its artificial 
aqueous solution. Exper imentations were showed in the group method to examined the 
outcome of adsorbent dose, contact time, pH , and temperature. Maximum dye elimination 
(94.3%) was completed at pH 10 using an adsorbent dose of 10 g/L in 90 min of contact time 
at 40℃. Th e economi c process at neutral pH and atmospheric temperature (30 ℃) gives 89.3% 
https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  571 dye elimination taking the same contact time and adsorbent dose [48].  Several dyes are lethal 
to mammalian life and fishes; they hinder microbes' development  and affect fauna and flora. 
Additionally , numerous dyes and their disintegration imitative have shown poisonous to the 
marine creature (mammals, microorganisms, aquatic plants , and fish) [49,  50]. They are also 
cancer -causing in nature and give rise to cerebral abnormalities and inte stinal cancer in the 
embryo. Textile dyes can give rise to allergies such as respiratory diseases and contact 
dermatitis, eye irritation, allergic reaction in the skin irritation , and irritation to the respiratory 
tract and mucous membrane. Reactive dyes f orm covalent bonds with polyamide (PA), woolen 
fibers , and cellulose . Likewise, it is presumed that  reactive dyes can form a bond with –SH and 
–NH 2 groups of proteins in living creature s [51].  
3. Major Chemicals and Dye used in Synthetic Textile Industry  
The dyes used commonly are divided into natural and synthetic types. Synthetic dyes 
are easy to produce and provide fastness. Such feature s of synthetic dyes make them be used 
more widely than natural dyes. Synthetic dyes are used each and every day worldw ide to print 
the fabrics, leather coloring, hair complexion,  etc. Dyes acquire diverse chromophoric groups 
and among them mostly used are azo, anthraquinone, triarylmethane , etc. The huge amount of 
dye consumption release s pollutants and produces environme ntal pollution through the 
effluents getting discharged from the textile industries or others [52].  Synthetic dyes can be 
further classified into different types such as the azo dyes, anthraquinone, triarylmethane, 
Sulphur , and phthalocyanine based on  their chemical structure. On the other hand, depending 
upon their synthetic dyes, a mode  can be direct, reactive, disperse basic , and vat type of dying 
[53, 54] . The types of dyes used in the synthetic textile industries vary depending upon the type 
of fabrics  manufactured. Depending upon the type of fabrics manufactured, the dyes can be 
classified into the following different types - 
1. Dyes for cellulose fibers  
2. Dyes for protein fibers  
3. Dyes for synthetic fibers  
 
Figure 2. Representation of the classification of dyes . 
https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  572 3.1. Dyes for cellulose fibers . 
The reactive dyes are mainly used for the cellulose fibers , while the others used may 
include indigo, direct, vat, sulfur dyes etc .  
3.1.1.  Reactive dyes . 
Such dyes are often referred to as reactive fiber  dyes. These dyes are the significant 
type of dyes used to dye the cellulose fibers and sometimes also dye the protein fibers like  silk 
and wool. These dyes react with the fiber molecules and form covalent bonds with them , which 
are very effective. According to a study, the productions of reactive dyes in the world have 
been increased three -fold in the three years (1988 to 2011).  
3.1.2.  Procion MX . 
This dye is used at normal room temperature and is found as a kind of cold reactive 
dye. These dyes are considered to give color inside of fabrics rather than superficially. And 
these dyes are most commonly used in tie -dyeing and , apart from cell ulose fibers, also used for 
the dyeing of wool, wood paper, basketry stuff , and silk.  
3.1.3.  Cibcron F .  
These dyes give an effortless wash fastness. These dyes could be stored for further use. 
These dyes do  not have a wide range of colors and function only in t he slightly warmer 
temperature  (40-48°C). Cibcron F dyes are used for dyeing the cellulose fibers as well as the 
silk and wool.  
3.1.4.  Sabracon F . 
These dyes' functioning  is similar to the Procion MX dyes , but these  found as little less 
reactive than the Procion MX. These Sabracon F dyes provide  a color range from delicate pastel 
to vibrant and  outstanding wash fastness. Sabracon F is used for dyeing the cellulose fibers as 
well as the silk and wool.  
3.1.5.  Drimarene K . 
These dyes could work under a wide range of  temperatures (30 -50°C) and are stable in 
both powders as well liquid form. These dyes are not considered suitable for synthetic fabrics 
but suitable for dyeing the cellulose fibers, silk, and  the printing and dye bath. These dyes give 
as easy wash fastnes s. These dyes remain active and can be stored for future use.  
3.1.6.  Remazol . 
Most commonly used for silk printing and also the cellulose fibers and wool. These are 
found as less reactive than the other dyes. These are more stable in water as these dyes have 
the masking group, which stops them fro m reacting with the water.  
3.1.7.  Direct dyes . 
These dyes are the cheapest among all other dye s. These dyes are having an absence of 
fixing property and drying up quickly. These dyes work within the temperature range of 79.4 -https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  573 93.30 C. Direct dyes are used for dyeing the cellulose fibers, rayon , silk, and wool and  the use 
of chemical fixative agents.  
3.1.8.  Naphthol . 
These dyes are prepared by mixing the two different chemicals – naphthol and the diazo 
salts, which determine the color of the dye.  This dye is considered as the cold -water dye and 
used within the ice water only. Naphthol is supposed to contain the more harmful chemicals , 
making  them less suitable for use at home.  
3.1.9.  Vat dyes .  
Applied on cellulose f ibers and also cotton. These dyes give fastness of washing, 
bleaching , and light. These dyes are reported as the indigo dyes' derivatives and provide other 
vat dyes such as indigoid, thioindigoid, anthraquinone,  etc. [54].  
3.1.10.  Sulfur dyes. 
These dyes display good light fastness , low-cost and excellent washing fastens. Apart 
from all this, the utilization of Sulphur dyes always remains high [54].  
 
Figure 3. Types of dyes used for cellulose fibers. 
3.2. Dyes for the protein fibers . 
Protein fibers are obtained from animals and are more complex than cellulose fibers. 
The dyes  are having high pH denature the protein fibers. Therefore, acid dyes are preferred for 
dyeing the protein fibers such as wool, angora, cashmere,  and silk. The m ost important acid 
dyes used for the protein Fibers are –azo dyes, triarylmethane , and anthraquinone.  
3.2.1.  Azo dyes . 
These dyes provide high color intensity and brightness to the fibers. Azo dyes are used 
for about 60 -70 percent of all the dye groups. Azo dyes are highly water -soluble and belong to 
the largest group of synthetic aromatic dyes [55].  
3.2.2.  Triarylmethane dyes .  
These dyes are broadly used in stamp inks, printing , and writin g. 
3.2.3.  Anthraquinone dyes .  
Suitable for dyeing wool and silk. A sub-class of these dyes  is used for dyeing the 
protein fibers , i.e., fiber reactive dyes.

 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  574  
Figure 4. Types of dyes used for the dyeing of protein fibers. 
3.3. Dyes for the synthetic fibers . 
Dispersed dyes are the mainly used dyes for synthetic fibers, which are mostly applied 
for the printing of nylon, polyesters, acetates,  etc. Depending upon their energy, the dispersed 
dyes are categorized into the following – a. E type - is low energy used in thermosol dying ; b. 
S type - high energy and used in high pressure/ high-temperature dyeing ; c. SE type - suitable 
for all type s of dyeing methods . 
3.3.1.  Direct dyes . 
They are u sed to dye synthetic fibers and protein fibers. These dyes don’t get dried fast 
after being applied to the fabric . 
3.3.2.  Basic dyes . 
Found as the cationic dyes as these dyes form cationic salt after getting dissolved in the 
water. These are considered effective and powerful dyes for acrylic fibers [56].  
3.3.3.  Disperse dyes.  
Thes e are the s ynthetic colorants that are commonly applied in the textile industry . 
These dyes are applied to the polyesters but also applied for nylon, cellulose acetate, acrylic 
fibers , etc. [54].  
 
Figure 5. Types of dyes used for synthetic fibers. 
4. Methods of Treatment of Effluents from the Textile I ndustry  
The effluents released from the textile industries consist of a mixture of dyes, metals , 
and pollutants.  The effluents discharged have a pH, color, suspended solid particles, COD and 
BOD , etc. [53] . There are physical, chemical , and biological methods for the treatment of 
effluents from the textile industry. The treatment of effluents with one of these three methods 
is not enough in decolorizing and the other effluents from the wastewater. While some dyes 
are not easy to biodegra de as some of the acidic dyes don’t easily get absorbed, so they skip 
https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  575 the treatment. Therefore, there is a need to combine different effluent treatment methods 
because such a combination can remove 85% of the non -desired matter [57] . 
Various treatment meth ods of effluents from the textile industries have been explained 
below [58] . 
4.1. Physical methods . 
The help of logically occurring forces such as gravity, electrical attraction, van der Waal 
forces , etc., can exclude  substances in effluent management. As these forces don’t alter the 
chemical structure of the required molecules. Therefore, the physical methods include the 
following methods  - 
4.1.1.  Adsorption . 
This method is considered the most efficient method for the management of effluents 
or industrial wastewater. In this method , natural and synthetic adsorbent s are used, e.g., silica, 
alumina, ferrierite, etc., while the activated carbon is found as the most effective adsorbent for 
removing  organic compounds from th e industrial effluents. Apart from this, polymeric 
adsorbents that occur in nature and cellulose bio -adsorbents  produced synthetically are also 
used.  
4.1.2.  Coagulation and flocculation . 
In this method of effluents treatment, organic and inorganic coagulants are used.  
Organic  coagulants such as polymers and inorganic coagulants , including alum, lime , and iron 
salts, are used. Among these, alum is considered the most significant and efficient inorganic 
salt for separating  dyes from the textile’s effl uents. When the coagulation binds up with the 
filtration, then the process is most commonly preferred for removing  heavy metals, organic 
carbon, iron, manganese , etc.

Figure 6. Representation of the methods of treatment of effluents from the textile industry.  https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  576 4.1.3.  Membrane p rocess . 
This method has the capability to reuse the material , i.e., used for the dyeing , and helps 
in the separation of the dyestuff. The advantage o this method is that it helps in the separation 
of dyes, elucidation , and concentration . This method is not widely used or preferred as this 
requires special equipment, highl y expensive , and membrane -fouling,  etc.   
4.1.4.  Ultrafiltration . 
This method allows the revival of the dyes from water. It removes the particles and 
macromolecules from wastewater. The transport properties of the membrane are based on the 
thickness of the membra ne. This method is preferred as pre -treatment for reverse osmosis.  
4.1.5.  Micellar enh anced ultrafiltration (MEUF) . 
This is the best technique recognized for the removal of impurities. Most industries 
have used the ultra -filtration technique, but this MEUF demands further filtration and  no direct 
reuse. This method is used to remove both dyes as well as multivalent metal ions from the 
water.  
4.1.6.  Reverse osmosis . 
This method is found as hyper -filtration , where water moves through the partial ly 
permeable membrane . 
4.1.7.  Nanofiltration . 
The effectiveness  of this method lies between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis.  By 
using this approach, reactive dyes can be effectively separated from the wastewater.  
4.2. Chemical methods . 
Using these methods, the chemical oxidation of the pollutants present in the textile 
effluents leads to the removal of the toxicity in them. Oxidizing agents are chosen for chemical 
oxidation.  The different types  of chemical  methods are described below . 
4.2.1.  Photocatalytic degradation of dyes .  
This approach is most commonly used in the modern era. In the presence of some 
nanoparticles and oxidants, the dyes undergo degradation immediately. Such degradation of 
the dyes depends upon the photocatalytic properties of them. Vari ous catalysts such as TiO 2, 
ZnO, nanoparticles are also used to remove the color of the variety of synthetic dyes.  
4.2.2.  Oxidation and photocatalysis with hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) –  
This method preferred for handling the textile effluents in two kinds of systems , as 
given below.  
a. Homogenous system – by using the UV or visible light, ozone, peroxidase etc.  
b. Heterogeneous system – by using semiconductors light, zeolites, clays etc.  
H2O2 removes the color from the industrial wastewater due to the presence of Fe (II) 
sulfate and titanium oxide.  https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  577 4.2.3.  Ozonation . 
It is a pplied for the removal of colors from synthetic dyes. The major limitation of this 
method is that it releases hazardous molecules and carcinogenic nitrogenous aromatics. 
Therefore, this method is not preferred for use.  
4.2.4.  Degradation of dyes usi ng sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) . 
NaOCl  is preferred as a cleaning agent and disinfectant. The benefit associated with it 
is that it can be easily stored and transported. The dyes which contain the amino acids in their 
groups are degraded by treating with this chemical. The major drawback of using NaOCl is 
that it releases poisonous chlorine gas after mixing with the acids. So pr ecautions should be 
appropriately followed  [59,60].  
4.2.5.  Electrochemical method . 
This method is based on the redox reaction , which separates the metals from the 
wastewater. This technique has become trendy in the last two decades. The electrochemical 
method further involves electrocoagulation techniques , electro -disinfection, electro - floatation, 
electro -deposition, electro -oxidation, etc. this technique is beneficial in the different types of 
industrial effluent s. It is a flexible and generous skill. In this approach, the electron is the key 
reagent that acts as a disinfectant and do es not produce solid remains  [57].  
4.3. Biological method . 
This bioremediation method becomes more preferred over the physical and chemical 
methods as this approach is cost-effective and eco -friendly. [ 61] Bioremediation is considered 
the most powerful approach for treating industrial textile ef fluents or  industrial wastewater 
loaded with organic components. Around seventy percent of the organic stuff is degraded by 
applying the biodegradation method. For the synthetic dyes, the bioremediation approach is 
easy and optional but also found to be co mplicated. Most of the microbial types have been 
assessed to remove  color and mineralize various  dyes [62].  
5. Agricultural Waste Materials as an Adsorbent  
Between the several conservative techniques for exclusion of dye particles from 
sewages, the adsorption of contaminants by non -living biomass (materials of biological origin), 
inactive and biosorption has been powerfully suggested by scientists universally  as an effective 
and reasonable sustainable tech for the exclusion of artificial colorants from manufacturing 
sewages [63]. The adsorption potential of farming waste matter of sugarcane bagasse used to 
eradicate malachite green dye from aqueous solution wa s studied. The adsorbent was measured 
by FTIR analysis and BET surface arena quantification. Several specifications such as contact 
time, adsorbent dose, temperature , and initial dye concentration were considered to detect their 
outcome on the dye adsorpti on method. At finest principles of the exceeding specification, 
greater than 95% exclusion ability was grown within 120 min at an adsorbent dose of 1 g/L for 
a preliminary dye concentration of 50 mg/L. The adsorption of dye was found to follow a 
pseudo -second-order rate equation [63]. Farming waste is an environmentally friendly 
resource, abundant and low cost that is utilized as an extremely effective adsorbent. The most 
used sources to remove the dye and heavy metals are peat bagasse, coffee powder, pista chio https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  578 peel, squash coal, rice hulls ash, garlic peel, banana peel, pomelo peel, tea waste, coconut 
shells, orange peel, pomegranate peel , and squash coal. The key elements of agricultural waste 
include water, hemicelluloses, proteins, lignin, simple sugars,  hydrocarbons, starches , and 
lipids , encompassing  several forms of functional groups. These functional groups lead to an 
increase of active sites and greater adsorption of impurities [64].  
5.1. Natural form of agricultural waste utilized as adsorbent . 
Due to forestry and agricultural industries , by-products are form ed. It could be 
presumed to be cost-effective adsorbents since they are present in large amount s in nature, 
cheap, need slight proceeding , and are productive resources. These constituents are access ible 
in huge amounts and may have the potential as absorptive due to their economic and physio -
chemical characteristic. The w ood industry produced sawdust as a by -product in large amount s 
that is either utilize d as packing material and cooking fuel. Sawdus t is straightforwardly 
obtainable in the countryside at a small cost [65]. The sewage water of various manufacturing, 
like cosmetics, printing, textiles, paper, leather, etc., encompasses many  harmful dyes. There 
are many method procedures and adsorbents,  which are obtainable for the dispensation of this 
sewage water holding dye content. The application of easily accessible cheap and environment -
friendly adsorbents to eliminate  harmful dyes from aqueous waste by the adsorption method 
has been revised. This review paper has given a collected list of safe to handle, easy -to-dispose -
off, low cost,  and easily available. These adsorbents have been divided into five di fferent  
classes based on  their state of availability: (1) fruit waste, (2) plant waste, (3) bioad sorbents, 
(4) natural inorganic materials , and (5) waste constituents from industry and agriculture. A few 
treated adsorbents have shown decent adsorption range for Congo red, basic red, methylene 
blue, rhodamine B, crystal violet, etc., but this adsorptio n procedure is highly depend ent on 
pH, and in this treatment , process pH plays an important role in the pH of the medium plays a 
vital role [66]. The elimination of dyes from waste seepage is very ecologically significant 
because a slight quantity of dye in water can be visible and toxic [67]. These constituents are 
often resilient to deprivation using b iological methods and are not demolished by conventional 
chemical and physical methods. Aquatic life is affected by dyes, as it prevent s sunlight from 
passing  through the water. Dyes may cause toxic to aquatic animals' environment and 
significant damage to  human life [68,69].  
5.2. Granular activated carbon and chemically treated form of agricultural wastes 
utilized as adsorbents . 
Forestry and Farming forms secondary products may also suggest renewable and an 
inexpensive supplementary basis of activated carbons. These waste resources have slight or no 
commercial value and often present a discarding issue. Therefore, there is a demand to valorize 
these economic by -products. Thus, an adaptation of waste resources into activated carbons 
would add significant economic  value, help decrease the price of waste disposal , and most 
significantly gives a significantly reasonable alternat ive to the prevailing profitable activated 
carbons. Activated carbon was produced from dehydrated public manure sludge , and group 
method adso rption experimentations were led to study its potential to eradicate complex 
reactive dye from dyeing unit effluent [70]. Commercially accessible activated carbons are 
generally extracted from natural resources such as coal, wood, lignite , and coconut shel l, but 
nearly any carbonaceous substances may be used as a predecessor for the production of carbon https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  579 adsorbents [71]. Activated carbon is a regularly used adsorbent in pharmaceutical and chemical 
industries, sugar refining, wastewater , water treatment, and adsorbent in point -of-use (POU)  
point -of-entry (POE) home water filtration systems.  Rising necessities for purer and extra 
refined sewage from various procedures propose that, excluding the expansion of new 
machiner y, the need for industrial activated carbon will only rise in the future [72]. Abundant 
farmed waste and several unused plant parts offer renewable and an inexpensive supplementary 
source of activated carbon (AC). These leftover resources have slight or no commercial pric e 
and frequently pose a serious  dumping problem. So, these leftover elements are used in an 
untreated and treated method for the elimination of dyes. Porter show ed that adsorption of AC 
is a complete treatment and effective for textile wastewater. Producti on of ACs from various  
Agro waste to treat  wastewater has been conveyed earlier [73].  
6. Textile Dyes: Impact on E nvironment  
The textile manufacturing industries consider for two-thirds of the whole dyestuff 
marketplace. Dyes used to deliver into the wastewater are 10 -15% during the dyeing process 
and source environmental pollution and problems related to health and several compounds used 
in the textile industry are regarded as maj or contaminants in the textile industry's wastewater . 
Globally, environmental issue s related to the textile industry are linked with water 
contamination produced by the straight liberation of unprocessed sewage and liberation of 
lethal compounds in the  aquatic environment. Due to this occurrence of hydrosulphide in the 
water body and reductions oxygen concentration and block the sunlight to pass through the 
water body which is harmful to the water ecology Chlorine are bounded to colorants which are 
carcinog enic in nature Textile industry effluent contain heavy metals which are not 
decomposable and assemble in primary tissues of the body and may cause signs of sicknesses. 
Unprocessed or partly used textile sewage can be detrimental to terrestrial and aquatic life b y 
disturbing the natural environment and producing permanent health issues [44] . A significant 
hazard to the atmosphere is the existence of unprocessed dyes in water bodies  because these 
reactive dyes inhibit the photosynthesis development of hydroph ytes by hindering the sunlight 
from piercing , which further cause s the production of poisonous materials [74]. During 
oxygen -deficient environment condition s, toxic aromatic amines are formed due to 
unprocessed dye effluent [75] . Several groups of tumors o f a distinct body part such as liver, 
spleen, bladder , and chromosomal deformities in mammalian cells and normal aberrations in 
model organisms showed their linkage with azo dyes according to some reports [76] diffused 
contamination produce the salt level in a water body, which makes it unsuitable for irrigation 
and human utilization. Chromium (Cr) and sulfur trioxide (SO 3), and chromium (Cr) are 
poisonous impurities that create a significant hazard to microorganisms and marine life that are 
beneficial for the refinement of the water rivulets. Abrupt alteration s in dissolved oxygen 
quantity  Bacteria degrade debris leftovers of starch, cotton (organic substances), increasing the  
oxygen demand in water.  Used of diverse substances in textile manufacturing caus es 
differences in pH in the water and affect s aquatic life [78]. When textile industry seepage is 
used for irrigation , then the plants' chlorophyll content decreases and protein, carbohydrates 
content of plants decreases, and chlorophyll is a direct sign o f poisonous properties of textile 
dye sewages  floras [79]. In general, dyes have little toxic effect in aquatic organisms and 
mammals [27], but products developed by bio deprivation dyes, mainly aromatic amines from 
the anaerobic reduction of azo dyes, can  be dangerous [80,81]. Reactivity of dyes due to their 
hydrolyzed form and a high degree of reactivity and due to high steadiness of effluents  may https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.567587   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  580 persist in the atmosphere for a longer period (~50 years). And nowadays, reactive dyes are 
mainly utilized in  the textile industry . Because of their marketable significance, the toxicity 
and impact of dyes liberated in the habitat have been broadly studied [81 -84]. Azo dyes that 
are made up of the major group of artificial pigments utilized are subsequently the most 
common artificial dyes released into the habitat [85,  76]. Azo dyes have been connected to 
chromosomal aberrations in cultured mammalian cells, splenic sarcomas, bladder cancer , and 
hepatocarcinoma, producing nuclear anomalies in the experimental animal. The r ise of bladder  
cancer in dye workers, which are mainly due to contact with great quantities of azo dyes, has  
appeared [83].  
7.  Impact Textile Dyes on Aquatic Environment  
Dyes can cause several environmental and health hazards and persist in the atmosphere 
for a  longer period due to high photostability and thermal to oppose biodegradation. The 
prominent ecological worry with dyes is their reflection and absorption of light penetrating the 
water. Sunlight absorption declines the photosynthesis of algae and the food chain. Excess 
quantity of textile dyes in water bodies ceased the reoxygenation capacity of the receiving 
water and halt ed the sunlight, thereby upsetting biological activity in aquatic life and  the 
photosynthesis activity of aquatic plants or algae [86] . Dyes have lethal properties due to 
occurrence for the longer time period in the atmosphere (i.e., half -life time of several years), 
Gathering of sediments in aquatic life or in fishes, putrefaction of impurities in cancer -causing 
or mutagenic chemical co mpounds , and also low aerobic biodegradability.  Numerous dyes 
and their breakdown products are mutagenic, carcinogenic and/or lethal to life. The small 
quantities of dyes in the water are very observable, deliberately disturbs the condition and 
transparen cy of water bodies like lakes, rivers , and others, major to harm the marine ecology. 
Azo dyes have lethal properties, mainly mutagenic and carcinogenic. They get in the body by 
ingestion and are metabolized by intestinal microorganisms  causing DNA damage [ 87, 88].

8. Conclusions  
Dyes are the major industrial pollutants and water contaminants . Synthetic dyes are 
used every day worldwide to print  fabrics, leather coloring, hair complexion , etc. The effluents 
released from the Textile industry characterized by a high content of pollutants such as organic 
and inorganic materials, heavy metals, colorants , and a mixture of dyes and a huge amount of 
dyes consumption release the pollutants and produces environmental pollution through the 
effluents getting discharged from the textile industries or others. The effluents discharged have 
a pH, color, suspended solid particles, COD and BOD , etc. If effluent is directly discharged 
without being treated, it will bring serious harm and impact on the ecological environment . In 
the a quatic environments , artificial dyes cause rampant health hazards when they counter with 
some other chemical compounds and form non -biodegradable secondary products. The seepage 
ejaculated from textile dy eing mills is not only lethal, but it is also rich in the occurrence of 
mutagenic and teratogenic cancer -causing as well as mutagenic chemical compounds. 
Therefore, decolorization of dye s is a significant feature of wastewater treatment before 
release. It is tough to eradicate the dyes from the sewage because dyes are not easily degradable 
and are usually not eliminated from wastewater by conventional wastewater systems . 
Biological aerobi c wastewater systems are not successful for decolorization of the majority of 
dyes. Therefore, to accomplish the desired degree of treatment, it is needed to assimilate 
physical, biological and chemical procedures and use  Agriculture waste materials in the ir 
natural,  granular activated carbon and chemically preserved form of agricultural wastes used 
as adsorbents. The treatment of effluents with one of these three methods is not enough in 
decolorizing and the other effluents from the wastewater. While some dyes are not easy to 
biodegrade as some of the acidic dyes don’t easily get absorbed, so they skip the treatment. 
Therefore, there is a need to combine different effluent treatment methods because such a 
combination can remove 85% of the non -desired matter  treatment of effluents from the textile 
industry.
