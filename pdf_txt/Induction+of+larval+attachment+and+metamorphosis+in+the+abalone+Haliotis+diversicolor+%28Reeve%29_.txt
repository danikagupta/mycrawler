INTRODUCTION
The early life cycle of the majority of marine inverte-
brates includes a larval phase. A critical stage in thelarval life history occurs at competence, a physiologicalstate wherein dispersing larvae are able to attach and
subsequently metamorphose (in the following referredto as ‘settlement’) into sedentary juvenile individuals(Crisp 1974, Scheltema 1974, Chia 1978). The onset oflarval surface exploration and substratum choice forpermanent attachment is influenced by the presence ofbioorganic films on marine surfaces (Zobell & Allen1935).

ABSTRACT: Larval settlement in the fouling polychaete Hydroides elegans Haswell (1883) is medi-
ated by natural biofilms, a complex consortium of marine bacteria, benthic diatoms, protozoa, fungiand adsorbed organic matter. Currently, the inductive effect of natural biofilms on larval settlementis attributed to the bacterial component. In this paper, we present results of an investigation of thediatom component of natural biofilms with respect to induction of larval settlement in H. elegans .
Thirty-two diatom strains were isolated from natural biofilms, identified and individually investigatedin still-water laboratory settlement assays. A multiple pairwise comparison of larval settlement ratesgrouped the diatoms into 3 statistical categories: (1) ‘inductive’; same percentage of larval settlementas in the positive control (glass slide with natural biofilm); (2) ‘no effect’; same percentage of larvalsettlement as in the negative control (clean glass slide); and (3) ‘weakly inductive’; percentage oflarval settlement significantly higher and lower than in the negative and the positive control, respect-ively. Out of 32 diatom strains, 3 (10%) fell into the first, 19 (59%) into the second and 10 (31%) intothe third category. The variability in larval settlement was not correlated with the density of diatomsin the monospecific films. Despite sterile measures and the use of antibiotics, diatom films underinvestigation were not axenic, with bacterial abundances ranging from 200 to 8000 cells mm
/H110022.
No quantitative correlation between the bacterial abundance in diatom films and the percentageof larval settlement was observed. To evaluate the qualitative impact of the bacterial fraction in themixed diatom-bacteria films on the induction of larval settlement, 6 representative diatom strains,comprising the 3 categories stated above, were selected to create diatom-free microbial films with thebacterial contaminants of each culture. Whilst the bacterial abundance in the non-axenic diatom filmsand the diatom-free control films was statistically the same, the percentage of larval settlement towardsthese treatments differed significantly for the diatom strains belonging to category (1) and (3).These categories comprised 4 different genera of diatoms, indicating that the observed inductiveeffect on larval settlement was not restricted to a certain diatom genus. Our results suggest that inaddition to microbial films, benthic diatoms may significantly contribute to the mediation of larvalsettlement behaviour in H. elegans by marine biofilms.

films’ or ‘NBF’) are highly variable over time and het-
erogeneous in composition. They are mainly com-prised of adsorbed macromolecules, attached bacteriaand diatoms, with all of these components enmeshedin a matrix of extracellular polymers (Mihm et al.1981). Biofilm formation on a marine substratum modi-fies its surface chemistry (Characklis & Cooksey 1983)and strongly affects recruitment of larval inverte-brates. The relevant literature reports numerous exam-ples of marine invertebrate larvae being attracted to,or repelled by NBF (reviewed by Maki et al. 1992,Pawlik 1992, Rodriguez et al. 1993, Todd & Keough1994, Wieczorek & Todd 1998, Qian 1999). In thesestudies, the inductive or inhibitive effect of NBF onlarval settlement was attributed to the bacterial com-ponent of biofilms, more specifically bacterial glyco-proteinacious exopolymers (e.g. Zobell & Allen 1935,Kirchmann et al. 1982, Johnson et al. 1991, Szewzyket al. 1991, Leitz & Wagner 1993, Maki 1999).
Surprisingly few studies have addressed the role of
marine benthic diatoms in mediating the settlementresponse of invertebrate larvae although their pro-
portion in marine biofilms can be high, especially inthe case of illuminated surfaces. In the barnacle Bala-
nus balanoides , an alga and a diatom mediate larval
surface exploration and substratum choice. On a smallscale, these biological cues sharply define an area ofsuitability for permanent attachment and metamor-phosis in B. balanoides (Le Tourneux & Bourget 1988).
Apart from this example, previous studies were mainlydirected towards the potential effects of marinebenthic diatoms on larval settlement of invertebratespecies with grazing juveniles, such as abalones (Ebert& Houk 1984, Kawamura & Kikuchi 1992, Slattery1992, Bryan & Qian 1998), sea urchins (Tani & Ito 1979)and sea cucumbers (Ito & Kitamura 1997). The natureof settlement cues involved has not been elucidatedbut was correlated with the diatom cell density on thesettlement substratum and associated with appropriatepost-larval dietary requirements (Slattery 1992, Daumeet al. 1999).
In this study, we investigated the role of benthic dia-
toms as mediators of larval settlement in the serpulidpolychaete Hydroides elegans Haswell (1883), a filter-
feeding fouling invertebrate, abundant in tropical andsubtropical waters around the world. This species waschosen as a test organism owing to its well investigatedlarval settlement behaviour. Physical surface parame-ters are of minor importance in the induction of larvalsettlement of H. elegans . Although settlement patterns
are passively influenced by larval capture in currenttraps and eddies (Walters et al. 1997), it was demon-strated that water flow (Qian et al. 1999) and surfacefree energy (Qian et al. 2000) can affect the larvalsettlement pattern but may not act as physical settle-ment cues. Instead, larval settlement in H. elegans is
strongly induced by NBF (Hadfield et al. 1994), mak-ing this species an early colonist of newly submergedsubstrata. The bacterial component in particular has sofar been reported to be responsible for the overallinductive effect of natural biofilms on larval settlementof H. elegans . Only a small fraction of bacterial species
within the complex biofilm community is reported tobe inductive, whilst the majority of tested strainsshowed no or a weak effect on larval settlement (Lau &Qian 1997, Unabia & Hadfield 1999).
In summary, previous investigations have clearly de-
monstrated that the microbial proportion in marinebiofilms can act as a larval settlement cue for Hydro-
ides elegans , which is consistent with reports on larval
settlement induction in other invertebrate taxa bymarine bacteria. However, in the marine environment,NBF generally comprise a variety of additional com-ponents. Surface exploring larvae will therefore en-counter a highly diverse conglomerate of further cuesthat may regulate the settlement behaviour.
In this study, we investigated the induction of larval
settlement in Hydroides elegans by NBF, focusing on
the potential role of the diatom component in NBF asamediator of larval settlement behaviour. A variety of
benthic diatoms were isolated from NBF, purified,identified and individually tested for their inductiveeffect on larval settlement in still-water laboratoryassays. Our goal was to test the hypothesis that mono-specific diatom films generate a similar range ofsettlement responses in H. elegans as shown with
monospecific films of bacteria from NBF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Larval culture. Adult Hydroides elegans were
obtained from PVC settling panels (100 cm
2) that
had been deployed underneath fish farm rafts at 1 mdepth at Long Harbour, Hong Kong between July andAugust 2000. After this period, except for someencrusting bryozoans, barnacles and spirorbid tube-worms, panels were almost uniformly covered with a1cm thick layer of sexually mature H. elegans . Panels
were brought to the laboratory where the calcareoustubes were scraped with forceps. Panels were placedin glass dishes with seawater and were removed after5min when a sufficient amount of gametes had been
released. The gamete containing seawater was filtered
through 70 µm mesh to remove debris and subse-quently through 25 µm mesh to retain fertilised eggs.Eggs were gently rinsed in 0.22 µm filtered seawater(FSW) and transferred into aerated 2 l plastic contain-ers containing FSW and the flagellate Isochrysis gal-
bana (Tahitian strain) at 10
5cells ml–1. Larval cultures106Harder et al.: Role of marine benthic diatoms in larval settlement induction
were incubated at 24°C under a 15 h light:9 h dark
photo cycle. After Day 4, the larval culture was filteredthrough 90 µm mesh and provided with new FSW.Larval competence was determined according tomorphology as described in Wisely (1958) and by aquick test with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)(Qian & Pechenik 1998). After 5 to 6 d, when the cul-ture contained mostly competent larvae, it was filteredthrough 110 µm mesh. The larvae retained on themesh were immediately transferred into FSW and usedfor larval settlement assays within 60 min.
Isolation and culture of benthic diatoms. From May
to June 2000, sterile glass microscope slips were sus-pended vertically for 5 d underneath fish farm rafts at1.5 m depth at the same location given above. The slipswere dip-rinsed in FSW and the biofilm was brushedoff with sterile paintbrushes into 50 ml CORNINGtubes containing FSW. A dilution series of the biofilmsuspension was inoculated onto 1% agar preparedwith f/2 nutrient medium (Guillard & Ryther 1962).Agar plates were incubated at 24°C with overheadfluorescent illumination (0.3 ×10
16quanta s–1cm–1)
under a 15 h light:9 h dark photo cycle. Distinguish-able diatom colonies formed within 1 wk of incubationand were successively sub-cultured until monospe-cific diatoms were obtained. Diatoms were cultured inaerated 400 ml Erlenmeyer flasks under the aboveconditions. The nutrient medium was changed weekly.
Development of diatom films and diatom-free
microbial control films. Expt 1: When a visible diatom
film had formed in the culture flasks, monospecificdiatom suspensions were prepared by brushing theculture flasks with sterile paintbrushes. A concen-trated stock solution of the antibiotics streptomycinand penicillin was added to the suspensions at a finalconcentration of 2.5 ×10
–4M streptomycin and 1.0 ×
10–4M penicillin. After 6 h, 4 ml aliquots of the diatom
suspensions were transferred into sterile petri dishes(FALCON, #3001; 8 replicates) containing autoclavedglass microscope cover slips (24 ×24 mm) and in-
cubated for 24 h under gentle shaking at the growthconditions stated above. Diatoms attached and prolif-erated during this period and formed thin algal filmson the glass slips. Subsequently, filmed cover slipswere dip-rinsed in autoclaved FSW and transferredinto sterile petri dishes (FALCON, #1006). Five repli-cate dishes were filled with FSW for larval bioassays,the remaining 3 slips were fixed with 4% formalde-hyde in FSW for enumeration of diatom and bacterialcell densities.
Expt 2: In addition to the procedure described above,
the diatom strains 5, 23, 17, 27, 29 and 30 were selectedto create diatom-free microbial films with the bacterialcontaminants of each culture. Suspensions of diatomsand bacteria were filtered through 1 µm mesh. Afterwashing the diatom containing filter residue with auto-
claved FSW, diatom cells were re-suspended in 50 mlof FSW. The volume of the bacteria containing filtratewas reduced to 50 ml on a 0.22 µm filter membrane.The bacteria containing diatom suspensions and thecorresponding diatom-free bacterial samples wereused to treat cover slips according to the proceduredescribed above. To evaluate the extent of a systematicbacterial contamination of samples due to experimen-tal handling procedures, a control was prepared ac-cording to the procedures described above, but with-out the inoculation of a diatom strain.
Enumeration of diatom and bacterial cell densities.
Diatoms were enumerated by chlorophyll fluorescenceand direct light microscopy. Bacteria were visualisedwith the DNA-binding fluorochrome 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Fluka Chemie). The formalin-fixed cover slips (3 per diatom strain) were rinsed withdistilled water and stained with DAPI at a concentra-tion of 0.5 µg ml
–1for 5 min at room temperature.
Cover slips were individually wet mounted and diatom/bacterial cells were recorded at a magnification of100×(for diatoms) and 1250 ×(for bacteria) in 5 ran-
domly chosen fields of view (ZEISS Axiophot fluo-rescence microscope, λ
Ex=359 nm, λEm=441 nm). The
enumeration of cell densities of diatoms and bacteriaprior to the bioassay served to describe the film char-acteristics encountered by surface exploring larvae atthe commencement of the assay.
Experimental protocol. Still water larval settlement
assays were performed with replication (n = 5). Sterileglass cover slips and slips filmed with 5 d old NBFserved as the negative and positive controls, respec-tively. Twenty competent larvae of Hydroides elegans
were pipetted in a small volume ( ≤100 µl) from larval
batches of high density and transferred into sterilepetri dishes with treatment slips in 4.5 ml of FSW each.After 24 h incubation at 24°C, the number of settledjuveniles in experimental dishes was determinedunder a dissecting microscope.
Identification of diatoms. Diatoms were taxonom-
ically described where possible by visualisation andcomparison of their fine structure with references.Scanning electron micrographs of diatoms were pre-pared according to Stosch’s method (Tomas 1996).After neutralisation and several washing steps withdistilled water, diatom frustules were pipetted ontoglass slips and dried overnight at 80°C. Dried sampleswere sputter-coated with gold before visualisation by aJOEL 6300f scanning electron microscope at 10 kVacceleration voltage.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were carried
out using the STATISTICA (StatSoft) and SPSS (SPSS)computer packages. The data format percentage oflarval settlement was arcsine-transformed prior to sta-107Mar Ecol Prog Ser 229: 105–112, 2002
tistical analysis. To improve the transformation, a value
of 1/(4 n) (n = number of larvae used in a replicate) wasgiven to the replicates containing no settled larvae(Zar 1996). Cell densities of bacteria and diatoms werenot transformed. The normality assumption of data waschecked with Shapiro-Wilk’s W-test. Larval settlement
rates on diatom-filmed cover slips were individuallyevaluated versus the positive and the negative controlby multiple pairwise comparison (Dunnett’s test). Bac-terial densities in mixed diatom-bacteria films anddiatom-free bacterial films originating from the samediatom culture, as well as the corresponding larval set-tlement rates towards these films, were compared byStudent’s t-test for independent samples. Relationships
among larval settlement rates, and diatom and bacter-ial densities on cover slips were analysed by multipleregression analysis. The data presented in the figures
are not transformed.
RESULTS
Identification of diatoms
Diatoms were identified to species level where pos-
sible. The identified species comprised 9 differentgenera; Nitzschia spp. (12 strains), Amphora spp.
(3 strains), Achnanthes spp. (4 strains), Synedra spp.
(6 strains), Navicula sp. (1 strain), Denticula sp.
(1 strain), Scoliopleura sp. (1 strain) and Tropidoneis
sp. (1 strain). Three strains remained unidentified. Noelectron micrographs were obtained for diatoms of thegenus Synedra . Identification numbers were assigned
to individual diatom strains in ascending order accord-ing to their effect on induction of larval settlement(Table 1).
Expt 1: Larval settlement
Larval settlement rates in treatments with mono-
specific diatom films ranged from 1 to 71% and wereranked in ascending order of percentage of larvalsettlement (Fig. 1). A multiple pairwise comparison oflarval settlement rates grouped the diatoms into 3statistical categories: (1) ‘inductive’; same percentageof larval settlement as in the positive control (glass slidewith natural biofilm); (2) ‘no effect’; same percentage oflarval settlement as in the negative control (clean glassslide); and (3) ‘weakly inductive’; percentage of larvalsettlement significantly higher and lower than in thenegative and the positive control, respectively. Out of32 diatom strains, 3 (10%) fell into the first, 19 (59%)into the second and 10 (31%) into the third category(Dunnett’s test, α=0.05; 1-way ANOVA, p < 0.001).Expt 1: Quantitative relationships between larval
settlement rates and cell densities of diatoms 
and bacteria
Diatom densities on monospecific films ranged from
200 to 90 000 cells mm
–2(Fig. 2). Despite the appli-
cation of sterile measures during the set-up of thefilming procedure, bacteria were observed on diatom-filmed cover slips at densities ranging from 100 to10 000 cells mm
–2(Fig. 3). Cell densities of bacteria
and diatoms on 5 d old NBF were enumerated to38 000 ± 11 000 and 4000 ± 250 cells mm
–2, respect-
ively (Figs 2 & 3). The relationship between larvalsettlement rates and cell densities of diatoms or bac-teria on cover slips was analysed by multiple regressionanalysis. The analysis over all treatments resulted inno significant correlation among larval settlementrates, and cell densities of diatoms and bacteria (R

Expt 2: Qualitative evaluation of bacterial 
contaminants in diatom films on induction of 
larval settlement
Diatom densities in the mixed diatom-bacteria films,
generated with diatom cultures 5, 17, 23, 27, 29 and 30,ranged between 2000 and 7000 cells mm
–2(Fig. 4C).
The bacterial abundance in diatom-free microbialfilms and mixed diatom-bacteria films originating fromthe same algal cultures was statistically the same(Student’s t-test; Fig. 4B). With the exception of the
experimental films made from diatom cultures 5 and17, the percentage of larval settlement in response tomixed diatom-bacteria films was significantly higherthan to the corresponding diatom-free microbial films(Student’s t-test; Fig. 4A). The observation of 2500 ±
1540 bacteria cells mm
–2in the control indicated a sys-
tematic bacterial contamination due to experimentalhandling procedures despite the application of sterilemeasures. The effect of this contamination on themean percentage of larval settlement induction wascomparatively weak with 5 ± 5%.
DISCUSSION
This study is an extension of our investigations on
the relative roles of the various components of marinenatural biofilms (NBF) in stimulating larval settlementin the serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans . In
addition to previous studies on the significance of thebacterial component in NBF (Lau & Qian 1997, Beck-mann et al. 1999, Harder & Qian 1999), we testedavariety of monospecific diatoms isolated from NBF
with respect to their role in mediating larval settlementin H. elegans .
The statistical evaluation of test results of 32 mono-
specific diatom films in comparison to the controls ofNBF and clean glass substratum categorised thesettlement response into 3 distinct groups, i.e. (1) thesame as in the positive control (glass slip with naturalbiofilm); (2) the same as the negative control (cleanglass slip); and (3) in-between the positive and nega-tive control. Out of 32 diatom strains under investi-gation, 13 fell into the categories (1) and (3) with aninductive effect on larval settlement of Hydroides
elegans . These strains comprised 7 different diatom
genera, indicating that the inductive effect on larvalsettlement was not genus specific.
However, an unambiguous ascription of the obtained
test results to the presence of diatoms turned out to beimpossible as bacterial contamination was observed onthe filmed cover slips (see Fig. 3). The observed bac-terial densities were at least 3 times lower than in theNBF control, and thus may have played only a minoreffect on larval settlement. Moreover, no significant
linear relationship between larval settlement rates andcell densities of diatoms or bacteria was observed overall strains of diatoms. However, a mere quantitativeevaluation of the impact of the bacterial contaminationwould have neglected the significant qualitative effectof some bacterial strains on the induction of larvalsettlement. Therefore, the bacterial contamination inthe diatom films under investigation confounded theinterpretation of our test results.110

Considering the experimental difficulties to achieve
total axenicity of monospecific diatom cultures (Bhosleet al. 1995), an alternative approach was taken in orderto decouple the larval response to the bacterial com-ponent from that to non-axenic diatom films. Thebacterial communities associated with diatom cultureswere separated by filtration to create diatom-freemicrobial films, representing the respective bacterialcontaminants of each culture. Under the assumptionthat the separated bacteria reflect the communitystructure in the mixed diatom-bacteria films, a com-parison of the 2 film types allowed the evaluation ofthe qualitative effect of bacterial contaminants innon-axenic, monospecific diatom films on the induc-tion of larval settlement. For this investigation, 6diatom cultures were selected. Whilst the observedbacterial densities in diatom-free microbial films andnon-axenic diatom films were statistically the same,larval settlement on diatom films was significantlyhigher than on the microbial control films. Importantly,this was the case for those diatoms belonging to thecategories (1) and (3). These results indicate that theinduction of larval settlement by these treatments wasdue to the presence of diatoms and not confounded bythe presence of bacteria. The systematic bacterial con-tamination due to experimental handling procedures,despite the application of sterile measures, was com-paratively low and posed only a minor effect on theinduction of larval settlement. The bacterial abun-dance in the diatom films was at least twice as high asin the control, indicating that these bacteria were asso-ciated with the diatoms rather than being accidentallyintroduced into experimental treatments. Despite thelimitations in achieving total axenicity in single diatomcultures, our results suggest that the underlying causalmechanism for differences in observed larval settle-ment rates is due to qualitative characteristics of theindividual diatom strains.
Previous investigations of larval settlement induction
by marine benthic diatoms were mainly focused oninvertebrate species with grazing juveniles, such asabalones (Ebert & Houk 1984, Kawamura & Kikuchi1992, Slattery 1992, Bryan & Qian 1998, Daume et al.1999), sea urchins (Tani & Ito 1979) and sea cucumbers(Ito & Kitamura 1997). Marked differences both in thetime for completion of settlement and the settlementrate were correlated with the quality of diatoms andtheir densities on the settlement substratum. Thenature of the settlement cues in all of the above caseshas not been elucidated but was hypothesised tobe associated with post-larval dietary requirements(Slattery 1992, Daume et al. 1999). In contrast to thesestudies, post-larval survival in Hydroides elegans does
not depend on surface-associated food availability asjuveniles are efficient filter feeders.The induction of larval settlement in Hydroides
elegans is most likely mediated by chemical cues asso-
ciated with a suitable settling substratum. In the case ofbacteria, the inductive activity has been attributed tobacterial secondary metabolites and glycoproteinaciousbacterial exopolymers (Unabia & Hadfield 1999, unpubl.data). Similar conclusions were drawn with respect tothe induction of larval settlement by NBF in other inver-tebrate taxa (Zobell & Allen 1935, Kirchmann et al. 1982,Johnson et al. 1991, Szewzyk et al. 1991, Leitz & Wagner1993, Maki 1999). As surface attached bacteria and di-atoms share the characteristic of extracellularly secretedpolymers, such as polysaccharides, proteins and glyco-proteins (Cooksey et al. 1984), it is possible that larvalsettlement induction by certain marine benthic diatomsis also based on this class of compounds.
The objective of this investigation was to test the
hypothesis that individual monospecific diatom filmsgenerate a similar range of settlement responses inHydroides elegans as has been shown for monospecific
films of bacteria from NBF. Despite the potentiallyconfounding effects of bacteria, our results suggestthat this hypothesis cannot be rejected.
