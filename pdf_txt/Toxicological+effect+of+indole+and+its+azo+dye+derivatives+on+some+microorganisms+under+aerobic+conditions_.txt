Photocatalytic Degradation, Reactive 
Orange 16 Dye (RO16), TiO 2  Organic contaminants from industrial and/or domestic effluents may be harmful to 
humans directly or indirectly by degrading the quality of the environment. 
Consequently these contaminants must be reduced to levels that are not harmful to 
humans and the environment  before disposal. Among the available chemical methods 
heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation has been found particularly to be effective in 
removal of large number of persistent organics in water. Degradation of the organics 
was achieved by exposing synth etic effluents to UV light in a photocatalytic reactor in a 
dark compartment in the presence of catalyst. The degradation of RO16 was conducted 
at pH 5.5, 24 hr, 294 K and lamp power of 200 W. RO16 was prepared in 200 ml dye 
solution with concentrations of  20, 40 and 60 mg/L and the degradation took place in 
presence of TiO2 at concentrations of (0.5 -4.0) g/L. While photolysis (in absence of 
TiO2) was found to have no effect on the degradation of RO16, photocatalysis (in 
presence of TiO2 catalyst) degraded the dye to 0.4 mg/L.

INTRODUCTION  
 
 Contamination in water may lead to diseases, bacterial attack, fungal and sometimes even fatal 
consequences. For example there are many sources of ground water pollution that can cause nasty tastes and 
odors, and that may b e a risk to human health. Contamination of surface and ground waters may occur naturally 
or as a result of human activities such as agricultural runoff, industrial discharges and chemical spills [1,2]. 
Water pollutants such as microorganisms, nitrates and nitrites and micropollutants are examples of health risk 
contaminants. Many industrial processes generate wastewater streams contaminated with organic compounds 
harmful to human health and the environment. Water pollution by micropollutants such as pestici des, textile, 
dioxins, and organic compounds and so on is a worldwide problem at present [3]. The low removal rates of 
textile dyes turn them into potentially toxic contaminants [4,5,6] and if not managed, textile dyes will become a 
long-term risk on healt h [7,8]. Azo dyes are ubiquitous commercial chemicals that present unique environmental 
problems. More than 300 million pounds of dyes are produced annually in the United States. Colored dye 
effluents poses a major problem for the manufacturing plant as we ll as water -treatment plants downstream. 
Quite apart from the aesthetic desirability of colored streams resulting from dye waste, the azo dyes in particular 
can undergo natural anaerobic degradation to potentially carcinogenic amines [9]. One of the promis ing 
technologies is p hotocatalysis, which was found to be effective in removing a wide range of organic and 
inorganic compounds [10] and have been applied successfully in treating both drinking and waste waters 
[11]. In this work photocatalytic degradation , employing TiO 2 as catalyst is used for removal of Reactive 
Orange 16 dye (RO16 ). 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 Azo dye RO16 prepared in 200 ml at different concentrations (20, 40 and 60 mg/L ) was exposedto 
photocatalytic degradation using various concentrations of TiO 2(0.5-4.0 g/L ). The exposure time was varied 
from 0 -90 min, depending on the initial concentration of RO16. All Photocatalytic degradation was carried 
out at pH 5.5, 24 hr, 294 K and lamp power of 200 W. Analyses of the dye by UV -Vis were made by measuring 693                                                                                        Khaled Mezughi  et al, 2014

the absorbance at λ max = 494nm.  
  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 In order to investigate the effect of the presence of the photocatalyst, the decolorization of RO16 dye in 
aqueous solution was studied using only UV irradiation, only TiO 2 photocatalyst in dark, and UV in the 
presence of TiO 2. The results are shown in Figure 1.  
 
 
Fig. 1: Photodegradability  of RO16 (C0=20 m g/L, Ccat=1g/L). 
 
 Figure 1 shows that no significant degradation (or dye removal ) occurred when either the catalyst or UV 
irradiation (photolysis )used alone. However, when UV irradiation was combined with th e photocatalyst, a clear 
decoloriz ation of the dye took place. Indeed, 90% of the color  was removed in only 30 minutes.  This shows that 
the decomposition of RO16 is attributed to photocatalytic reactions that can effectivel y decolorize and degrade 
this dye .These results  are in agreement with [12,13 ]. 
 
Effect of catalyst concentration : 
 The effect of TiO 2 concentration on the photocatalytic degradation of RO16 was studied. Figure 2 shows 
plots of the relative dye concentration as function of irradiation time at different catalyst concentrations. When 
0.5 g/L TiO 2 was added, the degradation of the dye increased substantially giving a final concentration of RO16 
of less than 2 mg/L aft er 25 minutes irradiation. A further increase of TiO 2 concentration decreased the 
degradation reaction. Therefore the optimum amount of catalyst required for the degradation of 20 mg/L 
(3.24×10-2mM) RO16 was 0.5 g/L TiO 2. Also it was found that increasing the catalyst concentration above the 
optimum concentration resulted in aggregation of the catalyst particles, hence the available surface area for 
contact between the reactant and the photocatalyst was reduced. This would result in reduction of the active sites 
and leads to lower photocatalytic degradation rates.  
 Also, when TiO 2 was overdosed, the intensity of incident UV light was attenuated because of the decreased 
light penetration and increased light scattering, which embedded the positive effect coming from the dosage 
increment and therefore the overall performance reduced.

 The experiment at 40 mg/L (6.48×10-2 mM) initial concentration of RO16 was carried out with various 
concentration of catalyst as seen from Figure 3. As catalyst concentration increased, the removal rate of RO16 
reached a maximum at first 30 minutes (85.42% ) when the high concentration of catalyst used (3 g/L ).  
 But when 0.5 g/L TiO 2 was added, the degradation of the dye increased s ubstantially giving a final 
concentration of RO16 of less than 1.5 mg/L after 60 minutes ir radiation, which has reached a highly removal 
percentage of RO16 (96.83 %). A further increase of TiO 2 concentration decreased the degradation reaction. 
Therefore the  optimum amount of catalyst required for the degradation of 40 mg/L (6.48×10-2 mM) RO16 was 
0.5 g/L TiO 2.  
 Furthermore , when TiO 2 was overdosed, the intensity of incident UV light was attenuated because of the 
decreased light penetration and increased light scattering, which embedded the positive effect coming from the 
dosage increment and therefore the overall performance reduced.

 Also a farther initial concentration of RO16 has been used with various different concentration of catalyst to 
investigate the effect of catalyst concentration on the degradation rate of RO16. Figure 4 shows the initial drop 
of RO16 concentration which caused by physical phenomena (adsorption ) between the catalyst and dye before 
the suspension exposed to the UV light. As catalyst concentration increased, the removal rate of RO16 reached a 
maximum at first 60 minutes (94.87% ) when the high concentration of catalyst used (4g/L ). But when 1 g/L 
TiO2 was added, the degradation of the dye increased substantially giving a final concentration of RO16 of less 
than 0.5 mg/L after 90 minutes irradiation, which has reached a  highly removal percentage of RO16 (99.34 %).

Conclusion : 
 Reactive orange 16 (RO16 ) was degraded by photocatalytic (UV/TiO 2 and UV/H 2O2) process. TiO 2 can 
efficiently catalyze the decomposition of dye RO16 in the presence of light and oxygen.  The dye RO16 is 
resistant to direct photolysis and there was no degradation for RO16 in the dark and in the presence of TiO 2. The 
optimum conditions for fastest de gradation for 20 and 40 m g/L RO16 are at catalyst concentration of 0.5 g/L. 
On the other hand for 60 m g/L the optimum catalyst concentration is 1 g/L.
