1. Introduction  
 
    The disposed dyes in the textile industry cause severe 
problems in wastewater sources [1, 2]. Dyes are synthetic, 
water -soluble, dispersible, organic compounds that color 
natural water bodies when released into the environment [3].  
 
    Dyes have a wide r ange of applications in dyestuff, textile, 
rubber, leather, paper, plastic, and cosmetic industries for the 
coloration of the products, and their residues are inevitably 
found in industrial wastes [4, 5].  
 
  
 
        
    Synthetic dyes, suspended solids, and dissolved organics 
are major hazardous materials in textile effluents, which may 
affect the physical and chemical properties of fresh water [6 -
8]. In addition to the undesirable color of textile effluents, 
some dyes may degrade to produce carcinogens and toxic 
products [ 9]. 
 
    Furthermore, co lored effluents reduce light penetration, 
potentially preventing photosynthesis [10]. Even at low 
concentrations, synthetic dyes adversely affect the aquatic life 
and food chain [ 11].

Background:  Dyes are among the most hazardous chemical compounds, which are found 
in industrial effluents. The removal of dyes before the discharge of wastewater to the 
environment could reduce these environmental hazards. The present study aimed to evaluate 
the effic iency of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide -modified bentonite (CTAB -MB) 
surfactant in the adsorption of acid blue 80 (AB80) dye.  
Methods: This experimental study was conducted using a shaker (100 rpm) at room 
temperature and fixed pH of 7 using conical flasks  (200 ml) containing the dye solution 
(100 ml) to assess the adsorption conditions. In addition, five concentrations of the reactive 
blue dye were prepared to evaluate the effects of the initial dye concentration on adsorption.   
Results:  The experimental data indicated that the AB80 removal procedure was fitted with 
the Langmuir isotherm. The Langmuir adsorption capacities (q e) were 38.15 and 21.76 mg/g 
for 1 and 2 g/l of the adsorbent, respectively. Moreover, three kinetic models were selected 
to fit the kinetic data, including the pseudo -first-order and pseudo -second -order models and 
intra-particle diffusion. AB80 was fitted with the pseudo -second -order model at all the 
concentrations.   
Conclusion: According to the results, CTAB -MB was an affordable alte rnative to the 
removal of dyes from industrial wastewater.

waste  effluents is environmentally crucial [ 12]. 
 
    The removal of dyes from textile wastewater is difficult due 
to their high water -solubility, complex structure, and 
synthetic origin [ 13]. Various physical, chemical, and 
biological methods have been applied  for the removal of dyes 
from wastewater, including flocculation, coagulation, 
precipitation, adsorption, membrane filtration, 
electrochemical techniques, ozonation, and fungal 
decolorization [ 14-17]. However, none of these techniques 
have proven completel y successful in the elimination of 
synthetic dye s from industrial wastewater  [18]. Compared to 
other methods, adsorption is probably one of the simplest, 
most cost -efficient and effective physical processes for the 
removal of dyes from wastewater [ 19, 20]. 
 
    Activated carbon is an effective adsorbent for the dye 
adsorption process since it has a high surface area and 
excellent adsorption capacity, while it is relatively costly and 
has low selectivity and regeneration problems [ 21]. 
 
   Therefore, researc hers have been investigating other 
inexpensive, effective synthetic and natural adsorbents, as 
well as their modified products; such examples are bentonite 
(montmorillonite), sepiolite, and zeolite [ 22, 24]. 
 
   Bentonite comprises of one octahedral alumin a sheet, lying 
between two tetrahedral layers of silica [ 25]. The permanent 
negative charge of bentonite is attributed to the isomorphous 
replacement of Al3+ for Si4+ in the tetrahedral layer and Mg2+ 
for Al3+ in the octahedral layer [ 26]. The negative charge is 
balanced by the presence of replaceable cations (e.g., Ca2+and 
Na+) in the lattice structure, which enhance the adsorption of 
cationic pollutants. Several studies have been focused on the 
use of modified and organo -modified bentonite with a 
catio nic surfactant for pollutant elimination via a high load of 
surfactant [ 27]. Previous studies have denoted that the main 
mechanism of the adsorption process in dye elimination is the 
anionic exchange between the excessive anions and pollutants 
from the sur factant [ 26, 27]. 
 
    In the present study, bentonite was modified using 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which resulted in 
a new adsorbent and CTAB -modified bentonite (CTAB -MB) 
to improve the adsorption capacity. CTAB -MB was 
characterized by scanni ng electron microscopy (SEM) and 
nitrogen adsorption measurements. In addition, the adsorption 
capacity for the removal of acid blue 80 (AB80) was 
estimated. We also determined the effects of the adsorbent 
dose, initial concentration, and equilibrium time on the 
adsorption process in the batch adsorption techniques.  
 
2. Materials and Methods  
 
2.1. Reagents and Solutions  
 
    AB80 has a molecular weight of 678.2 g/mol with the CAS 
registry number of 4474 -24-2, wavelength of 582 nanometers, and molecular formula of C 32H28N2Na2O8S2. In the present 
study, AB80 was purchased from Sigma -Aldrich Company. 
A stock solution containing 1,000 mg/l of the AB80 was 
prepared by dissolving the dye in distilled water. Solutions 
were prepared through the dilution of the stock solution to 
reach the desired concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/L). 
The stock solutions were refrigerated in a volumetric flask and 
only taken out for the experiments in order to prevent 
spoilage. The initial pH of the solutions was measured using 
a pH -meter (Fisher Scientific Accumet; model: AB15) and 
adjusted to the required pH value by adding small volumes of 
hydrochlorice acid and sodium hydroxide prior to contact 
with the adsorbent.  
2.2. Synthesis of CTAB -MB 
 
   CTAB -MB was synthesized in  several stages. For CTAB -
MB synthesis, 25 grams of bentonite was placed in 250 
milliliters of water containing five grams of CTAB. The 
reaction components were stirred at the temperature of 25°C 
for 12 hours. The product was filtered and washed with 
distilled water repeatedly. Afterwards, CTAB -MB was dried 
at the temperature of 110°C for six hours [25]. The specific 
surface area of the adsorbents was measured using the 
Brunauer -Emmett -Teller method and liquid N 2 adsorption at 
the temperature of 196° K by t he conventional volumetric 
apparatus. The morphology of the sample surfaces was 
investigated using SEM (JEOL 6400).  
2.3. Batch Experiments  
 
    Batch adsorption experiments were conducted on a shaker 
at 100 rpm at room temperature using conical flasks (200  ml) 
containing 100 milliliters of the dye solution in order to assess 
the effects of the adsorption conditions at the fixed pH of 6.8 -
7. To evaluate the effects of the initial dye concentration, five 
concentrations of the AB80 dye (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/l) 
were prepared. Moreover, the effects of the adsorbent were 
determined using the adsorbent concentrations of 0.04, 0.08, 
0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, and 0.4 g/100 ml  . 
 
    After the adsorption process, the solution was centrifuged 
for 10 minutes at 6, 000 rpm, and the supernatants were 
studied in terms of the remaining dye concentrations using a 
UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) at each dye 
wavelength. Finally, the adsorption capacity and removal rate 
(in percentage) were calculated using the mass ba lance 
equation for the adsorbent, as follows [28, 29]:

3. Results and Discussion  
 
3.1. Characterization of Bentonite and CTAB -MB 
 
    The specific surface area and  porosity are the foremost 
characteristics of adsorbents. In the present study, the specific 
surface area and pore volume were estimated at 49.8 m2/g and 
0.016 ml/g, respectively. The SEM images of bentonite and 
MB are depicted in Figures 1 -a and 1 -b. As c an be seen, the 
bentonite agglomerates contained a few particles compared to 
those of MB. In addition, several particles in bentonite and 
MB showed the laminar crystalline habit characteristics of 
phyllosilicates. However, these particles were more dominan t 
in MB compared to bentonite . 
 
    The interactions of the surfactant molecules in the 
interlayer may also be attributed to the domination of the 
comparatively large laminar crystallites and agglomerates 
[28].  
 
3.2. Effects of the Adsorbent Dosage   
 
   Adsorbent dosage is a significant influential factor in the 
adsorption process since it affects the adsorption capacity of 
the adsorbent [30]. The effects of the adsorbent dosage on 
AB80 removal is illustrated in Figure 2. According to the 
results of the p resent study, increased adsorbent dosage from 
0.05 to 0.4 g/100 ml led to a higher rate of AB80 removal 
(from 35.5% to 87.68%). Furthermore, the adsorption of Cr 
enhanced rapidly with the increased dosage of the adsorbent 
from 0.05 to 0.1 gram, followed by  a slight enhancement from 
0.1 to 0.2 gram. This could be attributed to the increased 
sorbent surface area and availabili ty of more adsorption sites . 
However, our findings indicated that the adsorption capacity 
decreased with the increased adsorbent dosage  at constant dye 
concentrations (F igure 2), which could be attributed to the 
saturation of the adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface  due 
to particulate   interactions   which  could   be  attributed   to  the 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
saturation of the adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface due 
to particulate interactions (e.g., aggregation and  aggregation), 
which led to the reduction of the total surfac e area of the 
adsorbent . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3. Adsorption Kinetics  
 
    The kinetics of adsorption for the prepared CTAB -MB was 
desirable to determine whether the behavior of dye adsorption 
on the adsorbents could be described by a predictive 
theoretical model. Figure 3 shows the results of the time -
dependent AB80 adsorption p erformance of the CTAB -MB. 
Accordingly, the adsorption was an extremely quick process. 
The adsorption rate increased rapidly within the first 30 
minutes, contributing to approximately 75% of the ultimate 
adsorption amount, which augmented gradually afterwa rds 
and approached the adsorption equilibrium within 75 minutes. 
Such adsorption behaviors are typical of the specific 
adsorption process, where the adsorption rate often depends 
on the number of the available adsorption sites on the 
adsorbent surface, whi ch is eventually controlled by the 
attachment of the dye ions to the surface .

76                                                                                                         Journal of Human, Environment and Health Promotion. 2018; 4(2): 75 -80                                                                                                                                             In the current research, adsorption kinetic models were 
applied to interpret the experimental data in order to 
determine the controlling mechanism of AB80 adsorption 
from aq ueous solutions. In this regard, we used Lagergren 
pseudo -first-order and Ho and McKay pseudo -second -order 
models to assess the dynamic, experimental data. Lagergren 
pseudo -first-order kinetic is as follows : 
     
Log (q e – qt) = log q e – 𝐾1
2.303t 
    Where q t is the amount of the adsorbed AB80 per unit of 
the adsorbent (mg/g) at the time t, and K 1 represents the 
pseudo -first-order rate constant (min-1). The adsorption rate 
constant (K 1) was calculated based on the log plot (q e-qt) 
against t.  
    Ho and  McKay presented the pseudo -second -order kinetic, 
as follows : 
 
t
qt  = 1
k2qe2  + t
qe  
 
    Plots of t/q t versus t which are illustrated in Figure 4. The 
calculated parameters are presented in Table 1 . According to 
the information in this table, the correlation -coefficients for 
the pseudo -first-order kinetic model were comparatively 
lower, and the q e cal was significantly deviated from the q e 
exp data, which suggested that the adsorption system was the 
pseudo -second -order kinetic adsorption process. This is 
because in many cases, the pseudo -first-order equation is not 
well-fitted to the whole range of the contact time and is 
applicable only in the initial stage of the adsorption process.  
       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.5. Adsorption Mechanism  
 
    The adsorption mechanism of the adsorbate  onto the 
adsorbent followed three steps, including film diffusion, pore 
diffusion, and intraparticle transport. Furthermore, the effect 
of intraparticle diffusion on the adsorption rate was calculated  
 based on the correlation between the adsorptio n capacity and 
time, which is normal ly expressed as follows : 
 
 
qt = K d t 0.5 + C 
 
    Where q t denotes the amount of the adsorbed dye at any 
time (mg/g), K d is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant 
(mg/g min 0.5), and C represents the intercept of the straight 
lines, which provides the data on the boundary layer 
thickness. With regard to the fitting data to the mentioned 
equation, our findings demonstrated that if the linear 
correlation value is close to unity, t he intraparticle diffusion 
process is effective in CTAB -MB. Figure 5 illustrates the 
intraparticle diffusion curves for AB80 adsorption. As can be 
seen, the adsorption process was followed by two phases, and 
the resulting fitting line did not pass through the origin. 
Moreover, an initial linear portion ended with a smooth curve, 
followed by another linear curve. The two phases in the 
intraparticle diffusion plot suggested that the adsorption 
process occurred through surface adsorption, as well as the 
intrap article diffusion. The initial curved portion of the plot 
was rapid, demonstrating the effect of the boundary layer, 
while the second linear portion was due to intraparticle or pore 
diffusion.

3.6. Adsorption Isotherms  
 
    The equilibrium adsorption isotherm was used to describe 
the amount of the adsorbed adsorbate  on the adsorbent and 
concentration of the dissolved adsorbate at the equilibrium. In 
addition, the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were 
expressed using the following equations : 
 
  Ce
qe = 1
qmKL  + Ce
qm 
  
    Where Ce is the equilibrium concentration of AB80 (mg/l), 
qe represents the amount of the sorbed AB80 on the CTAB -
MB (mg/g), K L denotes the constant of the Langmuir model 
(mg/L), q max is the maximum sorbed AB80 by the CTAB -MB, 
KF shows the Freundlich adsor ption constant, and the 
constant n is the empirical parameter associated with the 
adsorption intensity, which varies with material 
heterogeneity. When 1/n values are within the range of 0.1 
<1/n <1, the adsorption process is considered to be favorable . 
 
    The plot of the experimental C e/qe against Ce and log q e 
against log Ce yields the 1/qmax slope. Moreover, the 
intercept 1/K L qmax and 1/n and log K F values were 
calculated based on the slope and intercept of the log qe plot 
against log C e, for the experimental data (figures are not 
shown ). 
 
    These figures show the Langmuir and Freundlich curves for 
AB80 adsorption on CTAB -MB, along with the experimental 
data. 
 
    The Langmuir and Freundlich constants and correlation -
coefficients are presented in  Table 2. Based on the obtained 
coefficients, it could be concluded that the Langmuir equation 
had a better fit for the experimental data (e.g., 0.997 and 0.998 
for 1 and 2 g/l of CTAB -MB, respectively) compared to the   
Freundlich equation. Therefore, the Langmuir isotherm had a 
better correlation with the experimental data compared to the 
Freundlich isotherm . 
 
    The 1/n values at the equilibrium were within the range of 
0.391 -0.836, indicating a favorable adsorption. This finding suggested the dominance of a physical mechanism when used 
for AB80 adsorption, which demonstrated that the adsorption 
bond became weak with the van der Waals forces rather than 
chemical adsorption. The obtained data indicated that AB80 
adsorption on CTAB -MB could be well -fitted t o the 
Langmuir isotherm model compared to the Freundlich 
isotherm model.  
 
4. Conclusion  
 
    The present study aimed to describe the adsorption of the 
AB80 dye from aqueous solutions using CTAB -MB. 
 
    According to the experimental results, the maximum 
removal efficiency of the AB80 ions occurred at the initial 
concentration of 10 mg/l and contact time of 75 minutes. 
Additionally, the removal efficiency of the AB80 ions 
increased at the higher dosage of the adsorbent. On the other 
hand, the isotherm stud y indicated that the Langmuir isotherm 
could optimally model the adsorption process . 
 
     Finally, our findings suggested that CTAB -MB is a 
suitable sorbent material for the adsorption of AB80 from 
aqueous solutions.
