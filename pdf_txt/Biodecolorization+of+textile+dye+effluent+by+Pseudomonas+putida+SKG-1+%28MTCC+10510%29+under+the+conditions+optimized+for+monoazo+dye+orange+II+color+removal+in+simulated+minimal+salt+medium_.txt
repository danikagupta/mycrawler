Isolation and characterization of two bacterial strains from textile effluents 
having Malachite Green dye degradation ability 
 
Abstract 
Water pollution from textile effluent is now one of the major issues all over the world. 
Malachite Green dye of the triphenylmethane group is a key component of textile effluents. 
This study aimed to isolate and identify potential Malachite Green dye degrading bacteria 
from textile effluents. Different growth and culture parameters such as temperature, pH, 
inoculum-size and dye concentration were optimized to perform the dye-degradation assay 
using different concentrations of Malachite Green dye in mineral salt medium. A photo-electric-colorimeter was used to measure the decolorizing activity of bacteria at different time intervals after aerobic incubation. Two competent bacterial strains of Enterobacter  spp. (CV-
S1 and CM-S1) were isolated from textile effluents showing potential degradation efficiency against Malachite Green dye. The RAPD analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed the genetical difference of the isolated strains Enterobacter sp. CV–S1 and Enterobacter sp. 
CM–S1. The two bacterial strains CV-S1 and CM-S1 showed complete Malachite Green dye 
degradation up to 15 mg/l under shaking condition with 5% (v/v) inoculums at pH 6.50 and 
temperature 35°C within 72 and 144 hours respectively. These findings indicate that the two 
potential bacterial strains can be used in large scale treatment of textile effluents in the future.

1. Introduction 
Textile industries besides having a contribution to the development of the global economy, 
water pollution by textile effluents is one of the major concerned issues over the world. One million tons of synthetic dyes are produced each year worldwide and approximately 280,000 tons of these dyes are emitted to the industrial effluents annually [1][2]. Because of their non-degradable nature, these dyes inhibit the entrance sunlight in water and hamper the photosynthesis process, thus affecting the aquatic flora and fauna [3] . In addition, evaporation of these dyes and breathing them cause various allergic reactions and also hazardous for children [4]. In Brazil, several textile dyes that contaminate drinking water source have been reported to be carcinogenic [5]. 
Physio-chemical techniques, for example, coagulation-flocculation, adsorption, oxidation and 
membrane techniques have been used for decoloring of textile dyes during the past several 
decades. But these methods are associated with high sludge formation, high cost, generation 
of unwanted byproducts and secondary pollution [6]. Hence, there is an urgency of an eco-
friendly, cost-effective and efficient approach of degrading textile dyes. Several 
microorganisms including bacteria, fungi and algae can be a potential alternative of removing 
polluting dyes [7]. Bioremediation of textile dyes by different microbial species have received much attention due to its cost-effectiveness, eco-friendly nature and public acceptability [8]. Isolation of textile dye degrading bacteria was started in the 1970s. Bacteria use these dyes as substrates and convert them into less complex metabolites by generating various oxidoreductive enzymes [9]. Recently different microbial species have been observed having the potentiality of degrading and decoloring textile dyes [10]–[15]. 
The present research aimed at isolating and characterizing Malachite Green (MG) dye 
degrading bacteria from the effluents of textile industry for possible use in the industrial 
process of bioremediation. Two bacterial strains Enterobacter  CV-S1 and Enterobacter  CM-
S1 were identified for Malachite Green dye degrading capability.  
 2. Materials and methods 2.1 Sample collection 
The untreated textile effluent samples , were collected in autoclaved plastic bottles from the 
drainage canal of two local textile industries in Kumarkhali, Kushtia, Bangladesh.  Physical 
properties such as color, temperature and pH of the samples were recorded on the sites and 
were stored in the laboratory at 4°C within 12 hours of collection.  
2.2. Dyes, chemicals and microbiological media 
Triphenylmethane dye malachite green (MG) was procured from local market close to the 
thread dyeing plant of Kumarkhali, Kushtia, Bangladesh. Dye degrading mineral salt (MS) medium was prepared by adding the following components (in g/L) : K
2HPO 4 (2) , (NH 4)SO 4 
(0.5) , KH 2PO 4 (0.2)  and  MgSO 4 (0.05); trace element (TE) Solution was prepared by adding 
the following components (in g/L) :  FeSO 4 (0.4),  MnSO 4 (0.4),  ZnSO 4 (0.2),  CuSO 4 (0.04),  KI 
(0.3), Na 2MoO 4 (0.05)  and CoCl 2 (0.04) and the components of enrichment medium was MS 
medium  with glucose 0.1%, yeast extract 0.05%, peptone 0.5% and NaCl 0.5%.  
Furthermore, nutrient broth and nutrient agar medium were used for culture maintenance.

All samples (untreated textile effluents) were used for isolation of dye degrading bacterial 
cultures. Enterobacter sp. CV–S1 was isolated for Cristal Violet dye degradation as described 
in the previously published article ( Roy et al.,  2 0 18 ) [7]. CV-S1 was further tested against 
MG dye. On the other hand, CM–S1 was isolated having both CV and MG dye degradation 
capability using the same techniques with few modifications.  
2.4 Colony characteristics and microscopic morphology observation 
After the isolation of two bacterial strains capable for significant dye degradation were the 
subject to study their various characteristics, such as study on colony characteristics, microscopic observation etc. Twenty four hour old cultures of the isolates were performed to study colony characteristics, Gram reaction and the cell morphology. The study of colony characteristics was determined according to  Paul G. Engelkirk and Janet Duben-Engelkirk (2008) [16]  and the cell morphology under microscope includes smear preparation and 
Gram’s staining was as described by WHO (2003) [17] 
2.5 Growth characteristics determination 
Bacterial growth characteristics was determined under different pH (6.00, 6.50, 7.00) and 
temperatures (30ºC, 35ºC and 40ºC) as well as at the rotation of 120 rpm through growth 
curve analysis by turbidity measurements at different time intervals using photo-electric-colorimeter. 
2.6 Sensitivity test to antibiotics 
To identify drug resistance in bacteria , simple and well-standardized disc diffusion method 
was performed which was based on the measurement of zone of inhibition around each antibiotic disc [18]. Antibiotic of different classes, Ampicillin (10
μg), Azithromycin (15 μg), 
Bacitracin (10 μg), Cephradine (30 μg), Ceftriaxone (30 μg), Doxycycline (30 μg), 
Erythromycin (15 μg), Neomycin (30 μg), Sulphamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (25 μg) and 
Tetracycline (30 μg) were used to test antibiotic sensitivity.  
2.7 Genomic DNA Extraction  
The boiling method was used to extract the genomic DNA of the isolated bacteria. Concisely, 
a single colony from an overnight culture (at 37 °C) of LB agar plate was suspended into 30 
µl of distilled water. The suspension was then boiled for 10 min at 100 °C. The mixture was 
instantly transferred into ice and cooled it for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min 
at 13,000 x g  and the supernatant, containing DNA, was used as the template for PCR 
amplification [19]  
  
2.7.1 Characterization by RAPD analysis:  
In RAPD, synthetic ( 10 bases long ) oligonucleotide primer is used to amplify genomic DNA 
under low annealing temperature [20]. The variable genes of the isolated bacterial strains 
were amplified using three RAPD primers: MT370563 (5´–TGCCGAGCTG–3´), MT370571 
(5´–TGCGCCCTTC–3´) and MT370573 (5´–GTGAGGCGTC–3´). A total of 25 μl reaction 
mixture for RAPD analysis contained ddH 2O 14.75µl, MgCl 2 (25mM) 2µl, buffer (10 /x1) 
2.5µl, dNTPs (10mM) 0.5µl, Taq DNA Polymerase (5u/µl) 0.25 µl, DNA template 1 µl and RAPD  primer (10µM) 4µl. The Polymerase Chain Reaction was performed by Swift™ Minipro thermal cycler in the following steps: denaturing at 95 °C for 5 minutes, followed by (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

40 cycles of 40 seconds of denaturing at 95 °C, 60 seconds of annealing at 36 °C and 2 
minutes of elongation at 72 °C with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 minutes.  
2.7.2 Phylogenetic identification through 16S rRNA gene sequencing  
16S rRNA genes were amplified using the bacteria-specific universal primers, a forward 
primer F27 (5´–AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG–3´; Tm: 61°C); and a reverse primer 
R1391 (5´–GACGGGCGGTGTGTRCA–3´; Tm: 67.4°C). The recipe of 25 μl reaction 
mixture was: ddH 2O 14.75µl, MgCl 2 (25mM) 2µl, buffer (10 /x1) 2.5µl, dNTPs (10mM) 0.5µl, 
Taq DNA Polymerase (5u/µl) 0.25 µl, DNA template 1 µl, forward primer (10µM) 2µl and 
reverse primer (10µM) 2µl. The thermal cycle for PCR amplification was same as mentioned 
in the section 2.7.1 except  annealing temperature which was 65°C instead of 36ºC. The 
amplified PCR product was purified from agarose gel by using AccuPrep® Gel Purification 
Kit (Bioneer corporation, Korea) in accordance with the directions of the manufacturer. The 
sequence was generated from the purified 16S rRNA gene using the DNA sequencer instrument (Model: Genetic Analyzer 3130). In order to identify the similarity in nucleotide sequences generated from the 16S ribosomal RNA amplification of the dye degrading bacteria was analyzed through NCBI BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) by aligning the homologous sequences. Neighbor-joining method was used to determine evolutionary relationship by using online software:  Muscle (v3.7), Gblocks (v0.91b), PhyML (v3.0 aLRT) 
and TreeDyn (v198.3) on the Phylogeny.fr platform [21], [22]. 
2.8 Assay of Malachite Green dye degradation  
The rate of MG dye degradation was expressed as percentage. Using a photo electric 
colorimeter the degradation was determined through photo-electric-colorimeter by observing the decrease in absorbance at absorption maxima (
λ max) where the degradation assay was 
determined by the following formula [23]. The concentration of dye in the supernatant was 
determined by absorbance at 660 nm. 
Dye Degradation/ (%)  = Initial OD – Final OD × 100 Initial OD 
 
Various parameters like inoculum size, pH, temperature, and initial dye concentration were 
optimized as previously described by Roy et al . (2018) [7]. Briefly, a volume of 10ml 
solution containing MS medium enriched with trace element solution and MG dye was 
placed in 50ml test tube. The MG dye of 15, 30 and 50 mg/L concentrations were inoculated with the freshly grown 5% bacterial inoculums under aerobic shaking condition (120 rpm) at pH 6.50 and temperature 35ºC. Each treatment was performed three times and the mean value was recorded for analysis. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1. Physical properties of textile effluents 
Textile wastewater contains a high amount of unused dyes which create abnormal coloration 
[24]. Visually the physical appearance of the collected three textile effluent samples were black colored and one was turquoise blue. In addition, textile effluents have a wide PH and temperature range [25]. The pH determination of waste water is crucial as it is an important parameter that determines and influences the treatment process [26]. During collection the pH of tested sample was slightly acidic to neutral which was within the permissible limit of WHO and IS 10500:1991 [27].

processes in water and is an important parameter [27]. Due to winter season the temperatures 
of the present collected samples were around 18ºC. 
3.2 Colony characteristics and microscopic morphology  
The colony morphology or appearance of the colonies varies from one species to another and 
thus colony features serve as important clues in the identification of bacteria [16]. In this 
present investigation, though CV-S1 and CM-S1 were isolated with different samples, similar 
colony characteristics was observed as shown in Table 1.  But according to the Figure 1, the 
gram negative rod shaped microscopic structures were significantly different in length which 
proved that both bacteria were microscopically different.

3.4 Growth characteristics 
Growth pattern of bacteria can vary vastly species to species [28]. The growth curve of the 
microbial culture was analysed to study the population growth. The growth of 
microorganisms was plotted as the logarithm of the number of viable cells in the Y-axis and 
the incubation time in the X-axis. Growth curve (Figure 2) was obtained for two bacterial 
isolates, CV-S1 and CM-S1 showed growth variations at different temperature and pH gradients where maximum growth was observed at pH 6.50 and at temperature 35 ºC.

3.5 Sensitivity to antibiotics Globally, multi-drug resistant bacteria is an emerging public health crisis [29].  Wastewater 
treatment plant serves as a remarkable source of antibiotic resistant intestinal bacteria and antibiotic resistant genes, which may transfer to other environmental bacteria [30]. Hence, the determination of antibiotic resistance profile of selected bacteria is necessary for large scale implementation of these bacteria in treatment plants. Both CV-S1 and CM-S1 bacteria under this study based on the zone of inhibition were found sensitive to azithromycin, cefriaxone, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim and tetracycline, intermediate sensitive to ampicilin, 
doxycycline and neomycin and resistant to bacitracin, cephradine and erythromycin.

3.6 RAPD analysis 
The two strains of MG dye degrading bacteria were characterized genetically by the Random 
Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique using the MT370563, MT370571 and MT370573 primers. Electrophoresis product of the amplified variable genes using 1.4% agarose gel showed different DNA banding patterns reveal that the two isolated bacterial strains CV–S1 and CMS–1 were genotypically different. Among three RAPD primers, primer MT370573 showed more variation than the primer MT370563 and MT370571 (Figure 3). Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is a PCR based method that is used to 
identify polymorphism in genomic DNA, thus useful in ascertaining dissimilarity in closely 
related bacterial strain [31].This molecular characterization of potential strains is helpful in 
identification and diversity analysis among bacterial isolates. [32] [33]

 3.7 Phylogenetic identification of dye degrading bacteria 
16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing is a predominant strategy for bacterial 
indentification as well as phylogenetic relataionship analysis [34]. The tree exhibited highest identity 99% according to isolation source for CV–S1 was 
Enterobacter  sp. HSL69 and for 
CM–S1 was Enterobacter  sp. HSL99. In order to perform a better classification, phylogenetic

tree was constructed. The evolutionary relationship of the dye degrading bacterial strains with 
other relevant bacteria were presented in the Figure 4 and their similarities found in the 
GenBank database in Table 2. The homology stipulated that the isolated strain CM–S1 was in 
the phylogenetic branch of the genus Enterobacter , and the strain CV–S1 constructed a new 
branch.

Though identification of bacterial strains through 16S rRNA gene sequencing vary between 
genera and species, up to 90% bacterial strains at genus level and 86% at species level can be 
authentically identified by this process [35]. 98.65% similarity is recognized as threshold for 
species identification via 16S rRNA gene sequencing [36].Therefore, based on this 
consideration, the isolates were identified as Enterobacter  sp. CV-S1 and Enterobacter  sp. 
CM-S1. The newly constituted branch confirms that the identified strain CV-S1 is a new 
strain of the genus Enterobacter . [7] 
3.8 Malachite green dye degradation 
As pH 6.5 and temperature 35ºC were optimized for dye degradation And at these defined  
pH and temperature, 5% inoculums of Enterobacter  sp. CV-S1 was able to degrade 
completely up to  15 mg/L MG dye within 72 hours (Figure 5), whereas, 5% inoculums of 
Enterobacter  sp. CM-S1 was able to degrade the same amount within 144 hours (Figure 6). 
Joshi and Mhatre (2015)  also observed maximum MG dye degradation by Enterobacter  sp. at 
pH 7.00 and temperature 37ºC which was closely to this pH and temperature [37]. The degradation of malachite green was studied at various increasing concentration of dye i.e. 
from 15, 30 and 50 mg/l. It was found that the rate of degradation was decreased with increasing concentration of dye (Table 3 and Table 4) and similar trend was observed by 
Wanyonyi 
et al. (2018 ) [38]

Another interesting finding is that during MG dye degradation no extra carbon and protein 
source was added in MS medium i.e. both bacteria had used MG dye as a carbon sources. But 
most of researches carbon or protein-enriched media were used for MG dye degradation by 
bacteria [39]–[42]. Indeed, those organisms are the real degrading organisms which can 
utilize MG dye as a sole carbon source and their degrading capacity in the presence of a trace 
amount of carbon source is dramatically accelerated. In a study Ali et al (2009), observed 
MG dye degradation for 6 days by two fungal strains Aspergillus flavus  and Alternaria solani  
up to 30µM ( ≈10.95mg/L) when MG was a sole source of carbon but degradation had 
increased up to 50µM ( ≈18.25mg/L) when extra carbon source was added in the medium 
[43]. Hence, Enterobacter  sp. CV-S1 and Enterobacter  sp. CM-S1 may be more effective 
industrially as they utilized up to 15mg/L MG dye as a carbon source.

4. Conclusion Although microbial degradation/decolorization of textile effluent is a challenging process, 
some microbes recently have been explored as the potential scavengers in textile dye and 
textile effluent treatment. In current study, two gram-negative rod shaped potential bacterial 
strains Enterobacter sp. CV-S1 and Enterobacter  sp. CM-S1 were identified having MG dye 
degradation capacity. As these isolates were able to degrade significant amount of MG dye 
without providing any carbon source, adding desirable carbon source they can be used successfully in the commercial treatment of textile effluents. These observations reveal that the two potential bacterial strains could be used in water treatment plant in near future.
