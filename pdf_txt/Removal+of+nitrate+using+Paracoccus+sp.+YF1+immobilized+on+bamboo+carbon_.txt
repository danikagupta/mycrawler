11. Introduction
The coexistence of various pollutants is a ubiquitous feature of 
natural water, contaminated groundwater, and municipal waste-water, with commonly occurring substances such as heavy metals and nitrate, widely investigated in environmental research [1, 2]. Nitrates are considered one of the most hazardous contaminants worldwide [3, 4]. Moreover, to the extremely high amount of nitrogen being continuously discharged into the environment, excess nitrate was also introduced into the aquatic-ecosystems [5, 6]. Nitrates can react with secondary and tertiary amines and methemoglobin to form carcinogenic nitrosamines in an infant. In spite of the 
World Health Organization (WHO) guideline value of 10 mg/L for human consumption, the concentration of nitrates in the water body in many regions is up to 400-500 mg/L [7]. Thus, it is urgent to develop an efficient technique for the removal of nitrates [8]. Nitrogen-containing compounds discharge from different waste-water treatment plants (WWTPs) may seriously threaten surface and groundwater, causing eutrophication of water bodies and severe impacts on human health [9]. To prevent severe water resource contamination by nitrogen pollution, the Chinese standards are set for pollutant discharge from municipal wastewater treatment Environ. Eng. Res. 2022; 27(2): 200526

ABSTRACT
In this work, a three-dimensional bioelectrochemical reactor system (3D-BERs) with granular activated carbon (GAC) was utilized  to study the 
feasibility of simultaneous removal of nitrates by autotrophic-heterotrophic denitrification process under different pH levels.  In this present study, 
it was found that when the influent COD/ NO 3- -N ratio ranged between 1.5 and 3.5, both autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifying microorganisms 
played an important role in denitrification. The experimental results demonstrated that the highest removal efficiency of nitra tes under the optimum 
COD/NO 3--N ratio of 1.5 (98.62%) was achieved with an initial pH of 7.5 ± 0.4. Likewise, when the COD/NO 3--N ratio of 3.5, the nitrates removal 
efficiency (81.12%) was achieved with an initial pH of 8.2 ± 0.3, respectively. Batch denitrification processes followed zero-o rder kinetics at various 
NO 3--N concentrations obtained. The bacterial community structure and relative abundance of bacteria changed at the level of genes and the 
phylum of immobilized GAC particles. Moreover, the diversity of bacterial composition enhanced the removal of NO 3--N at the inner surface 
(IS), and bottom surface (BS) of immobilized GAC carriers were Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Proteobacteria , and Thauera . In general, this technique 
is more effective for enhancing the denitrification process in the 3D-BER system.

2plants (2002-GB18918) [10]. Therefore, some treatment technologies 
need to be developed to further reduce nitrate residues in discharge, as strict environmental requirements have been implemented on nutrient discharge into receiving waters [11, 12]. The most common traditional methods for nitrate removal include adsorption [13], reverse osmosis [14], physicochemical [2], electrochemical [15], ion-exchange process [16], and biological treatment methods [17]. There are several limitations for physical or chemical approaches, i.e., high-level energy constraints, secondary pollution, and com-plex friable condition [10, 13, 18]. Among these various methods, the biological process is usually less costly in terms of maintenance and operational costs compared to physical and chemical processes [17]. Biological methods are efficient and cost-effective nitrate re-moval process that has been of increasing research interest [7].
Meanwhile, heterotrophic-autotrophic denitrification (H-AD) is 
used in biological processes in which nitrates can be reduced en-tirely to nitrogen gas without producing nitrogen residues, demon-
strating the advantages of economic efficiency and environmental 
friendliness [2, 19]. Bacterial immobilization technology has been widely used in wastewater containing a high amount of nitrates, 
organic matter, and toxic chemicals [20, 21], which has the advan-
tages of high biological density, strong anti-toxicity, and fast start-up processes [22]. In addition, the contribution in the GAC between 
heterotroph and autotrophs denitrifies increased the improved the 
removal efficiency of nitrogen [2, 23].
For the supporting GAC, carriers play an important role in the 
bacterial immobilization system [21, 23]. The GAC is an organic, 
n o n - p o r o u s  p o l y m e r  f i x i n g  m a t e r i a l  w i t h  a  h i g h  m e c h a n i c a l  s t r e n g t h level, extreme adaptability to the condition. It has excellent perform-
ance, as reported by a previous study [14]. While, in the 3D-BERs 
with GAC as a fixed system to support mixed bacteria in the bio-logical denitrification process, as they can provide a gradient con-
centration of dissolved oxygen and ample active area for the growth 
of high-density complex flora, which includes bacteria that reduce nitrate and nitrite [24]. However, little literature was available on 
the applicability of GAC-based bacterial immobilization techniques 
for treating nitrate-polluted water [25, 26]. The biofilm bacterial diversity on the GAC carrier must be examined in a situation with 
a low concentration of nitrates [27]. While in the denitrification 
process, several intermediates are formed during the conversion process from nitrogen oxide to gaseous N
2 [17]. Accumulation of 
a certain amount of nitrate-nitrogen under various conditions would 
seriously affect the removal efficiency of total nitrogen as consistent with the previous study [2], and has the close attention to the 
effects of carbon sources [28] and pH on nitrite accumulation [15]. 
However, little literature on the effects of an initial nitrate ratio to nitrogen on anaerobic denitrification, including denitrifying en-
zyme activity of and rich denitrification genes, has been discussed 
[8, 18]. Traditional denitrification processes depend on the oper-ation of four primary denitrifying enzymes, including respiratory 
nitrate reductase has shown: NO
3- → NO → N2O → N2. 
Therefore, many studies indicated that nitrate effects on the 
denitrification activity depended on existing denitrifying enzymes 
[29]. The heterotrophic process needs organic carbon to promote 
cell growth and serve as electron donors during the denitrification [ 1 7 ,  3 0 ] .  D o n g  e t  a l .  [ 1 4 ]  r e p o r t e d  t h a t  t h e  i n h i b i t o r y  e f f e c t  o n  
the denitrification process is due to a related inhibition of the denitrification gene abundance that causes N
2O accumulation. 
However, few studies recognised that the impact of the initial nitrate to nitrite ratio on nitrate removal and the nitrite reduction efficiency 
of the microbial immobilization system using GAC (MIS-GAC) im-
mobilized microorganisms to treat wastewater [31]. As most de-nitrifying microorganisms are heterotrophic, the addition of specific 
organic carbon source can enhance the nitrate removal, and organic 
carbon discharge is usually limited [9, 32]. The 3D-BER system only requires an organic carbon source to accumulate and enhance 
the removal of nitrogen using different COD/NO
3- -N ratios. The 
3D-BER technology is still in its early development stage, with only a few denitrification studies reported in the literature [5, 7, 
33]. The 3D-BERs actually combined the biofilm and electro-
chemical system, taking the benefits of these two treatment processes. In the 3D-BERs, particles such as Iron, Sulfur and GAC 
are occupied between cathode and anode, not only serving as the 
third bipolar electrode also providing colossal surface area for attach-ment and bacterial growth [31, 34]
In this research work, a novel 3D-BER system performance on 
the microbial diversity of the immobilized GAC biofilm carriers with non-porous polymer for treating nitrate-polluted by hetero-
trophic-autotrophic denitrification. The specific objectives of the 
present study were to (1) extensively analyse the effect of the low inlet COD/NO
3--N concentration ratio on nitrogen removal and pH 
were optimized in batch experiments; (2) to investigate the appro-
priate influent rate of COD/NO 3- -N range for nitrogen removal and 
the effect on nitrate to nitrite concentration for the nitrate reduction 
and nitrite accumulation; and (3) identify the different concentrations 
of nitrates for the removal of nitrogen were compared by employing kinetic fitting models. Moreover, the denitrification process was stud-
ied, and the bacterial community structure on the inner and bottom 
surfaces of the GAC carrier were measured. These results may provide valuable information to design cost-effective denitrification processes 
for the extraction of nitrates and to enhance denitrification for solving 
many problems of municipal wastewater treatment.

The reactor was made of plexiglass cylindrical with a diameter 
of 10 cm, a height of 20 cm, a total volume of 1.2 L, and a working volume of 0.785 L. The cathode consisting of eight graphite rods

fixed in the centre of the reactor and were connected using in-
sulated electrical copper wire by DC-power. A DC-controlled pow-er supply: Model No: HQ3003SIII, supplied by Hansheng Puyuan 
Technology Beijing Co., Ltd (Beijing, China), with the ranges (0-3A 
and 0-30V), was used. Meanwhile, from top to bottom, space was filled with granular activated carbon (GAC) as third particle electrodes Environmental Engineering Research 27(2) 200526

(size 1.5-3mm) used for microbial growth purchased from Younga 
chemical Technology (Nanjing, Jiangsu Co., Ltd., China). The GAC 
was the best option for developing bacteria on cathode and anode surfaces of the inner zone and bottom zone in the reactor. GAC pre-treat-
ment was washed serval times with deionized water through a sulfuric 
acid solution (0.01 M) and dried for 24 to 30 h at 110°C [35].
2.2. Culture Development of Denitrifying Microorganism 
and Synthetic Wastewater
The denitrifying microorganisms found the biofilm on the 
anode-cathode surfaces and third electrode GAC in the 3D-BER system.  The simulated wastewater used in the batch experiments with different COD/NO
3--N ratio concentrations were prepared by 
diluting the same nutrients (including NaNO 3, CH 3COONa, KH 2PO4, 
and trace elements) with tap water. Therefore, the 3D-BER system were fed 0.785 L simulated wastewater containing: 30  mg/L
 
NO 3--N, 3.5 mg/L K2HPO 4, 4.5 mg/L NaCl, 5.56 mg/L KH 2PO4, 2.75 
mg/L CaCl 2, and 0.5 mL/L of concentrated trace elements stock 
solutions were prepared by dissolving; 15 g MgSO 4･7H2O, 2.2 g 
MnSO 4･H2O, 2 g ZnSO 4･H2O, 0.24 g CoCl 2･6H2O, 2 mg NiCl 2･6H2O, 
10 mg FeCl 3･6H2O, 0.5 mg CuCl 2･2H2O, 0.5 mg Na 2MoO 4･H2O 
and 15 g CaCl 2 into 1.2 L deionized water [8, 36, 37]. An enrichment 
phase has been extended to the denitrifying bacteria and the system dominant microorganisms [38]. The synthetic influent wastewater pH was adjusted by hydrochloric acid (HCL) or Sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The influent wastewater was usually maintained by 7.5 ± 0.2, and no further adjustment is required. 
2.3. Biofilm Development and System Start-up 
The 3D-BER system was initially started for 90 days with abundant anaerobic sludge (Mixed liquor suspended sludge (MLSS) of about 5.55 g/L) was collected as a source of inoculation from the Nanjing municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) China. Before culti-vation, 1.2 L of anaerobic sludge water was placed into the refrigerator 
with nutritious solutions at 4°C for seven-days. During the first three days, sludge water was circulated by a magnetic pump. After 15 days, anaerobic sludge water was placed in the reactor, and 350 mL of tap water was added to a total volume of 785 mL. It could also provide large surface areas for attachment and develop-ment of microorganisms. Nevertheless, electric current was not supplied to the 3D-BERs during cultivation after one week, the DC-power gradually used to 10 mA. Biofilm, immobilisation, and acclimation were completed prior to the start of the batch experi-ments, and the anode-cathode electrodes and the third electrode converted GAC at room temperature (27 ± 1.5
oC ) in to  da rk  grey . 
However, the influent was renewed two times in 24 h to fast growth microorganism in the reactor, and samples were collected after ten  days. The NO
2−-N, NO 3−-N, and denitrification efficiency  
were determined to evaluate the nitrate elimination in the 3D-BER 
system with GAC.
2.4. Batch Experiments for the Denitrification Process
The batch experiment was performed in the 3D-BER system to 
evaluate the performance of the denitrification process. In the 1
st phase of the experiments, the COD/NO 3--N concentration ratio 
ranged from '0 to 0.5, 1 to 1.5, 2.5 to 3.0 and 3.0 to 3.5' and the initial NO
3- -N concentration was 30 ± 0.2 mg/L, and the 
initial pH level was 7.0 ± 0.1. In addition, the initial pH was set at 6.0 ± 0.2, 6.5 ± 0.5, 7.0 ± 0.1, 7.5 ± 0.4, 7.8 ± 0.6, 8.2 ± 0.3 in the 2
nd phase of the experiment, and the initial NO 3--N 
concentration was 30 ± 0.2 mg/L with a COD/NO 3--N ratio of 
1.5 to 2.5. On average, the amo unt of nitrate and nitrite was 32 
± 0.2 mg/L. The initial NO 3--N concentration was 30 ± 0.2 mg/L 
with the COD/NO 3--N ratio and the initial COD/NO 3--N ratio was 
2.5-3.5 in the 3rd phase of the experiments with initial pH were 
6.0 ± 0.2 to 7.5 ± 0.4. Finally, in the 4th phase of the experiments, 
when the COD/NO 3--N ratio was 0 to 3.5, and the initial concen-
trations of NO 3--N were 30 ± 0.2, 20 ± 0.5, and 10 ± 0.7 mg/L 
with initial pH were 6.5 ± 0.5 to 8.2 ± 0.3, respectively (Table. S1). However, the concentration of NO
3--N in the influent was 
maintained at 30 ± 0.2 mg/L with an initial pH level. All batch experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Preliminary experimental findings indicate that immo-bilised microbes can achieve reasonably stable results within 8 h in 3D-BER systems with GAC. As a result, the batch test sampling time was regulated within 8 h, and the sampling was carried out at 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h intervals. The 3D-BER system perform-ance was cultivated on the GAC particle electrode to maintain denitrifying bacteria anaerobic conditions. The inoculum bacteria are a sufficient and complicated microbial inoculum purchased from BIONETIX® International Ltd. Co. Canada. This microbial group contains 32-strains of superficial bacteria and innumerable enzymes related to bioremediation. On the GAC biofilm surface of carriers, Proteobacteria, Thauera, Geobacter, Desulfomicrobium, 
Bacteroidetes, Sporomusa, Denitratisoma, and Thauera  were the 
dominants [23, 29]. The NO
3- -N concentration in the reactor, 
when nitrogen was exhausted, the residual substrate was removed, and fresh substrate was needed to avoid the endogenous bacteria metabolism. Then dissolved nitrogen species were measured imme-diately after sampling.Mahdi Hassan et al.
42.5. DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification, and MiSeq-
Pyrosequencing
The genus description of DNA extraction and PCR amplification 
of 16S rDNA can be found previously. However, the biofilm samples 
were taken from the reactor after the three-month denitrification 
process and then dried by the freeze-drying system. The inner surface (IS) and bottom surface (BS) GAC particles electrodes biofilm 
were divided from the cubic feet rooftop cargo carrier (STDY-20). 
The biofilm samples were extracted and purified by PowerSoil-DNA Extraction Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA92010, USA) [34]. 
The bacterial diversity was analyzed by Illumina-MiSeq-py-
rosequencing within primers-338F (5´-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCCA GCA-3'), and 806 R (5 ′-GGACTAHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3') amplified 
the hypervariable zones at V3-V4 of the bacterial 16r RNA protein 
sequence [39] using PCR thermal cycler system (PE300, Stuttgart, Germany) [11]. The PCR reaction was performed in the following 
manner: denaturation at 3 min for 95
oC, annealing at 55oC for 
30 s, extension at 72oC for 10 min, 27 cycle of 30 s at 95oC, and 
elongation at 72oC for 45 s [39]. However, PCR reaction was per-
formed three-times at 20 μL mixed with 4 μL of 5 x buffer FastPfu, 
20-μL of 2.5 mM deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 0.8 
μL of 5 μM of separate primer, 0.4 μL of FastPfu polymerase and 
10 ng of template-DNA. The PCR amplification product results 
were carried agarose-gel 2.2%, and required further purified by the AxyPrep
TM DNA gel-extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Marseille, France) and measured by QuantiFlour TM-St Fluorometer 
Method (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Los Angeles, USA) [39, 40]. The purified amplicons of all samples were pooled in equimolar 
concentrations analyzed by sequencing on a high throughput 
Illumina-MiSeq platform with paired-end sequencing (2 x 250-bp), according to the standard protocols by Novogene Co., Ltd., Beijing, 
China.
2.6. Biofilms Samples Analysis by SEM on GAC Particles 
Electrodes  
The IS and BS-GAC particles electrodes surface morphology for 
bacteria in biofilms was examined by scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM ). B efore SEM  analysis, a series of batch experim ent sam ple 
processing techniques (i.e., fixing, washing, dehydration, drying, coating, etc.) were applied. Approximately 0.8 g of the biofilm 
sample was placed in a 10 mL centrifuge-tube and centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 5 min. At that time, the supernatant was removed, 
and then 7 mL of 2.5% glutaraldehyde was added to mix with the sediment sample at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. Place 
the centrifuge tube in the refrigerator at 4
oC for 3 to 4 h to fixed 
the sample [41]. Afterwards, the tube was centrifuged for cen-trifugation at 6,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed 
after the centrifugation process. Add about 7 mL of ultrapure water 
to the biofilm sample left at the bottom of the centrifuge tube, centrifuge again at 6,000 rpm for 5 min, and then remove the 
supernatant. Such washing was performed three times by 
centrifugation. Next phase, the washed biofilm was dehydrated with 7 mL of 20%, 40%, 50%, 70%, 80%, and 90% ethanol for 
10 min. The biofilm sample was dehydrated 3-times, with approx-
imately 7 mL of 100% ethanol for 15 min each time. However, 7 mL of a mixture of ethanol and isoamyl acetate (100% ethanol: 
isoamyl acetate = 1:1) were poured into the centrifuge tube for 
15 min. Although, pure isoamyl acetate was added and replaced for 20 min. Finally, the settled samples were placed on filter paper 
(10 mL) and dried in a vacuum dryer (Mecha-Tech system Co.Ltd, 
UK) at a pre-cooling temperature of 10
oC for 24 h. Dry, then detonate 
w i t h  a  1 0  n m  g o l d  l a y e r  [ 1 1 ,  4 2 ] .  
The coated samples were examined with (Hitachi S-4300 
FEG-SEM, Austin, USA), and the images were captured digitally. The SEM images are shown in Fig. 2 , the morphology of biofilm 
attached to granular activated carbon (GAC) particle electrodes in the 3D-BERs. The GAC had a high specific area of about 450-900 m
2/g and a porous structure to facilitate microbial attachment 
growth, as reported [24]. The biofilm samples of the inner surface (IS) were abundant compared to the bottom surface (BS) and original sludge (OS), corresponding to the thicker bacterial community. In the IS, OS zone, the microbes are less in quantity due to lacking electron donors. It was found that in the 3D-BERs with immobilized GAC, biofilm was embedded in the abundance of microbial activity [2 4 , 2 8 ]. It w a s  cle a rly  o b s erv e d  in  ro d -s ha p e d  gra p h ite a n o d e a n d cathode, which was authentic in the other denitrification system [11, 16]. There also existed giant microbes, which may be hydro-gen-heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria. 
2.7. Analytical Methods and Calculations 
All effluent samples were filtered by 0.45 μm membrane filters 
(Millipore, Germany) before the analysis. Before calculating the

5indexes, the data was obtained through average repeated sampling 
[43]. N ‒NO 3-, was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometric 
(Shimadzu UV-1800, Japan) method at wavelength λ = 220 ‒275 
× 2 nm. Specifically, N ‒NO 2- was analyzed by N-(1-naphthyl-1, 
1-ethylenediamine dihydrochloride) spectrophotometric method at λ = 540nm, respectively. The pH and ORP were measured by 
a pH meter model pH-100 (Shanghai Yoke Instrument Co., Ltd., 
China). The chemical oxygen demand (COD) was analyzed by the acidic potassium dichromate oxidation method (Digital thermos 
reactor, DRB200, Germany). Dissolved Oxygen (DO) value was meas-
u re d  b y  a  p o rta b le  D O -m e ter (G W Q -D O 2 8 0 , X ia n  G a v in  E lec tro n ic Technology Co., Ltd China). While monitoring the temperature 
during the experiments installed an insertion thermometer in the 
reactor. All samples were stored at 4
oC prior to the analysis. At 
least three samples were taken for each test. The removal perform-
ance of nitrate and rate were determined using the formulas (C 1-C2/C1 
X 100) and (C 1-C2)/T, respectively. Where "C 1" was the initial influent 
concentration of nitrate, and the "C 2" was the final effluent concen-
tration of nitrate, and "T" is the reaction time.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. The Removal Performance of Nitrates under Different 
Initial pH and COD/NO 3--N Ratios 
The removal performance in the organic carbon-based de-
nitrification system is the main source of bacterial respiration and better growth during heterotrophic denitrifying enzymes  (Fig. S1). In the case of an initial NO
3--N concentration of 30 ± 0.2 mg/L 
and an initial pH of 7.5 ± 0.4, the level of COD/ NO 3--N ratio 
was observed in the range of 0.5-3.5 by adding different amounts of sodium acetate as a carbon source. Under the influence of the COD/ NO
3--N ratios, the changes of the residual NO 3--N, NO 2--N, 
and the sum of the concentrations of initial NO 3--N and NO 2--N 
w ithin 8h w ere observed in Fig. 3(a)-(b), respectively. As show n in Fig. 3(a), without adding sodium acetate as a carbon source, the denitrification process is fragile. However, in this study, the presence of a definite amount of carbon source, the concentration of NO
3--N has an identical tendency at different ratios of 
COD/NO 3--N, and it drops rapidly within the first 1.5 h and then 
stabilizes. Since the COD/NO 3--N ratio increased from 0.5 to 1.0, 
the residual concentration of NO 3--N was not significantly reduced. 
An optimal level of COD/NO 3--N ratio of 1.5 has the maximum 
removal of nitrate, while NO 3--N completely removed in 1.2 h. 
As described in Fig. 3(b), the carbon source addition results in a decrease in NO
2—N within 8 h and the suitable accumulation 
of nitrite. While the COD/NO 3--N ratio is between 1.5 and 2.5, 
the nitrite concentration reaches 1.98 mg/L to 1.02 mg/L in 2.5 h, and then rapidly decreasing almost 0 mg/L within 8 h. But, at the COD/NO
3--N ratios of 1.0 and 2.5, the nitrite concentration 
increased to the highest at 1.5 h and then gradually declined, causing a definite amount of nitrite to accumulate in 5 h [44]. Simultaneously, when the COD/NO
3--N ratio was 0.5 and 1.0, 
the corresponding denitrification efficiency was low. As shown in Fig. 3(c), the denitrification efficiency was 49.43% and 61.12% at 4.5 h. When the COD/ NO
3--N ratio was 1.5, the denitrification

pH = 6.0 ± 0.2 to 8.2 ± 0.3, with initial concentration of NO 3--N = 30 ± 0.2 mg/L, and the COD/NO 3--N ratio from 0 to 3.5, respectively .Mahdi Hassan et al.
6efficacy within 3 h reaches 98.62%, as compared to 81.12% when 
the COD/NO 3--N ratio was 3.5 [15, 37, 45]. As a result, the increasing 
COD/NO 3--N ratio from 2.0 to 3.0 did not significantly improve 
the denitrification efficiency. The increased carbon source con-tained substantially impacted nitrate removal performance as it provided sufficient carbon sources to meet the nutrients needed for bacterial cell growth [8, 46].
Heterotrophic-autotrophic denitrification is the process of bio-
logical nutrient removal by microorganisms using nitrate or nitrite [47] as a nitrogen source for microbial activity development and 
metabolism [24], similar results were reported in the previous works 
[30, 48, 49]. As the carbon source used as an electron donor was significant for the complete reduction of nitrates to nitrogen gas 
[37, 39, 50]. The time-lapse of the concentration change of nitrate 
and nitrite were presented in Fig. 3. The COD/NO
3--N ratio had 
a significant effect on reducing nitrate compared to reducing nitrites, 
with an appropriate increase in COD/NO 3--N ratio, to alleviate nitrite 
accumulation [14, 51]. Although the substrate electrons were re-duced, the competitive advantage of electrons for nitrite reduction 
enzymes was not as good as that of nitrate reductases. Isaka et 
al. [39] reported that the activated energy needed for a nitrite reduc-tion was higher than the removal of nitrates. The accumulation 
of nitrite can indicate an adequate amount of carbon sources. In 
the denitrification process, nitrate removal was an intermediate step and a rate-limiting step that greatly adjusted denitrification 
efficiency. Comparison with similar studies in the literature is 
summarized in Table 1, indicating that mutual autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification has major significant advantages. 
Compared to autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification, the ap-
parent advantage is high treatment capability and high removal efficiency [46, 52]. The lower utilization of organic carbon sources 
and no organic pollution make the process better than traditional 
systems [2, 17, 30].
In general, the reduction of nitrite was more complicated due 
to changes in the COD/ NO
3--N ratio, and when the COD/NO 3--N 
ratio increased to a certain amount, providing ample electrons for thorough denitrification, the accumulation of nitrite was effec-
tively suppressed, and the efficacy of denitrification was enhanced 
[28]. When sodium acetate is used as an electron donor, the complete denitrification ratio of nitrate to nitrogen gas is 1.5, as displayed 
in Eq. (1) [48].

However, in this work, an appropriate COD/NO 3--N ratio is re-
quired with additional cost and an excess amount of biomass in 
cognizance to improve denitrification efficiency. However, nitrogen will be used for bacterial growth [16, 28]. This immobilization 
process in the 3D-BERs achieves high nitrogen removal efficiency 
with a lower carbon source than previous studies [21]. The pH of the living environment of microorganisms may substantially 
affect bacterial enzyme activity in the reaction system. The effect 
of the initial pH on denitrification processes with an initial NO
3--N 
concentration of 30 ± 0.2 mg/L and COD/ NO 3--N ratio of 2.0 to 
3.5 is displayed in Fig. 3(d)-(f), respectively [28, 56]. Fig. 3(d) shown 
that the concentration of NO 3--N dropped suddenly and remained 
at nearby 0 mg/L at 1.2 to 2.2h at pH of 6.5 ± 0.5, 7.0 ± 0.1, 
and 7.5 ± 0.4, respectively [57, 58]. Since the concentration of 
NO 3— -N was dropped to the minimum level of 0 mg/L after 1.2 
h, the excellent ability to reduce nitrates was shown at an initial 
pH of 7.5 ± 0.4 [50, 52, 59].

was significant. When the initial pH was 6.5 ± 0.5, 7.0 ± 0.1, 
and 8.2 ± 0.3, the NO 2--N concentration increase to a peak level 
of 3.5 to 5.8 mg/L at 1.8 h and ultimately dropped to 0.22, 0.12, and 0.89 mg/L in the final effluent, respectively. While the concen-
tration of NO
2- -N decreased from 5.8 mg/L in 1.2 h, and 0 mg/L 
within 3.8h with an initial pH of 7.8 ± 0.6 [42]. In general, the accumulation of NO
2— -N was a severe problem at 1 —5.9 mg/L, 
and the initial pH was observed at 8.2 ± 0.3 [28, 47]. As illustrated 
in Fig. 3(f), the applicable denitrification efficiency has occurred between the initial pH values of 6.5 ± 0.5 and 7.5 ± 0.4. The 
initial pH of 7.5 ± 0.4 seems to be the best condition for the 
denitrification efficiency achieved 97.7% at 3.5 h. When the pH was 7.0 ± 0.1 —7.5 ± 0.4, the diversity of microbial immobilization 
in the 3D-BER system, denitrification efficiency is high, immobi-
lized microorganisms appear to be neutral in the alkaline environ-

7ment, which was linked to another research study showing that 
denitrifying bacteria prefer the pH range of 6.2-8.2 [59, 60]. 
The complete H-A denitrification reaction process, the GAC 
immobilized microorganisms, had a tremendous capability to re-
move nitrogen, even without pH regulation. It was believed that this microbial immobilization in the 3D-BER system can accept 
a wide range of pH values and acclimatize to pH variations, generally 
because the denitrification reaction be able to mitigate the effects of pH on the denitrifying bacteria [28], to some extent, the pH 
of microorganisms is maintained. Nevertheless, pH 8.2 ± 0.3 can 
be described as, when the initial pH environment was exceedingly alkaline, the inhibition of bacterial activity due to increasing the 
production of alkalinity during the denitrification processes would 
be emphasized [13]. Due to the competition between nitrite and electron reductase, excessive alkalization inhibits nitrite reduction 
enzymes, resulting in nitrite accumulation and low nitrogen reduc-
tion efficiency [34, 40].
3 . 2 .  R e m o v a l  R a t e  o f  N O 2--N/NO 3--N Concentration Ratios 
The effect of the initial NO 2--N/NO 3--N concentration ratio on de-
nitrification was investigated in the different COD/NO 3--N ratio 
at the range of 0 to 3.5, when the initial NO 3--N concentration 
was 30 ± 0.2 mg/L and the initial pH was 7.5 ± 0.4. The nitrogen 
concentration revealed a comparable disparity tendency in the various initial concentrations of NO
2--N/NO 3--N ratios, which de-
creased dramatically throughout the period and reached 0 mg/L 
at 4 h (Fig. 4(a)). When the COD/NO 3--N concentration ratio  was 
1.5, the nitrogen concentration dropped below 0.5 mg/L and the 
denitrification efficacy exceeded 98.5% within 3.5 h [28, 40]. 
However, without the inlet of nitrite, the remaining nitrogen concen-tration was 4.58 mg/L at 1.5 h. As illustrated in Fig. 4(b), the initial 
concentration COD/NO
3--N ratio increased from 0 to 1.5, the nitrite 
reduction and denitrification rate were raised, but the removal of nitrite was inhibited. The final results showed that the high 
concentration of NO
2--N/NO 3--N ratio accelerated nitrites decline, 
and nitrate dropped was the main feature in regulating the complete denitrification rate.
From the literature based on the concentration of the substrates 
and carrier structure, oxygen was not spread through a GAC-immobi-lization carrier, resulting in low dissolved oxygen on the inner 
surface of the 3D-BER system. Also, the reductase of nitrite is more complicated to the low concentration of dissolved oxygen 
during the enhancement of the denitrification process, and states 
from top to bottom microbial activity in the process of anoxic reducing nitrite may be effectively performed in the inner or middle 
zone of the GAC carriers [54, 61]. Therefore, when the nitrogen 
concentration is relatively high, then the substrates dissemination limitation becomes unstable, nitrogen is removed efficiently by 
the middle/inner to the bottom surface supporting the GAC carrier. 
It can be assumed that the inner region bacteria obtain more effective nitrogen removal [34]. Furthermore, the increasing initial concen-
tration of  NO
2--N/NO 3--N ratio was more positive impacts on the 
degradation of NO 2--N than that of NO 3--N [2], the purpose for 
which may be the reduced competition for nitrate reductase elec-
trons shown in  Fig. 4(b). 
In the absence of nitrates, the reduction rate of nitrites is higher 
than the reduction of nitrates, as nitrate reducing enzymes can 
no longer compete with electrons and facilitate the transformation 
of an electron into nitrate nitrite as a similar study was also reported [52]. 
3.3. Kinetic Linear Fitting Models at the Different Initial 
Concentration of NO 3--N
The performance of nitrogen removal at various initial concen-
trations of NO 3--N was studied in the range of 10 ± 0.7 to 30 
± 0.2 mg/L and the concentration of COD/NO 3--N ratio was 1.5 
to 3.5 with the initial pH of 7.5 ± 0.4, respectively. At different 
initial concentrations of NO 3--N, nitrogen in the system can be 
removed simultaneously, suggestive of the other initial nitrate levels 
would not influence in denitrification efficacy of these microbial 
activities in the GAC immobilization system. Nevertheless, it can affect the denitrifying removal rate (Fig. 5(a)).
To investigate the biological treatment of wastewater containing 
nitrate, the zero-order kinetic fitting model, the first-order kinetic fitting model, and the second-order kinetic fitting model were used 
to fit the denitrification removal rate of different concentrations 
of NO
3--N at different time. The results of the kinetics fitting linear 
m odels w ere presented in Table 2. The rate of correlation of the

8coefficient constant (R2= 0.95) of the zero-order kinetics linear 
fit model of different initial NO 3--N concentrations was relatively 
more considerable than that of other fitting kinetics linear models. 
It was shown in Fig. 5(b), nicely combines the denitrification curve for different conditions with the zero-order fitting kinetics linear 
model, as described in Eq. (2)
C
t = C o —Kot( 2 )
Where C t and C o indicate the nitrate concentration (mg/L) at 
time t (h) in the influent and the effluent of the system, and -K ot 
is the zero-order fitting kinetics linear rate constant (mg/(L ･h)). 
The correlation rate of the coefficient constant was R2= 0.986. 
The zero-order fitting kinetics linear constant was 3.954 mg/(L ･h) 
with an initial concentration of NO 3--N was 30 ± 0.2 mg/L, which 
was higher compared to the zero-order fitting kinetics linear constant rate was 2.134 mg/(L ･h), and the correlation rate of the coefficient 
constant was R
2 = 0.978, with an initial concentration of NO 3--N 
was 20 ± 0.5 mg/L. While, the initial level of  NO 3--N was 10 
± 0.7 mg/L, and the zero-order fitting kinetics linear constant rate 
was 1.986 mg/(L ･h), much lower through with the coefficient con-
stant correlation rate was R2 = 0.963, presented in Table 2. 
These results indicate that the advanced biological nitrogen re-
moval process was performed in the 3D-BER system. It was suitable for the description in zero-order-kinetic models presented, con-
sistent with previous studies [62, 63]. Moreover, the inlet of nitrate concentration greatly influences the denitrification rate, and with the increase of nitrate concentration, the rate of denitrification also increases [2, 7]. While the denitrification increases by nearly 1.5 times when the initial level of nitrates increases by about 5 mg/L, w hich agreed w ell w ith the literature [38, 40]. This could be explained by the mass transfer-resistance in the immobilized cell system [62]. The higher the substrate concentration, the poorer the substrate-diffusion resistance, which can improve the substrate use and improve cell growth and metabolism [11, 64]. Therefore, at the initial nitrate concentration of 30 ± 0.2 mg/L, and a high denitrification rate of 3.954 mg/(L ･h) was achieved in this work. 
Compared to the latest study combining iron-reduced bacterium and iron cycles, the average nitrate removal rate was only 0.69 mg/(L･h) with the influent nitrate concentration of 10 mg/L [21, 
62]. Feng Su et al. [61] reported that the advantages of heterotrophic denitrification through immobilized bacteria.

9was instigated by plotting the number of sequence samples com-
pared to the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) observed. More than 50,000 sequences were achieved for each 
sample  (Fig. S2(a)). Unweighted Unifrac distance cut-off values 
of samples OS, IS, and BS usually are accepted as points at which variation occurs in the genus and phylum level, respectively [24]. 
Rarefaction curves of sample OS, IS, and BS indicate that the 
slopes have a tendency to flatten, which means that sequence analysis describes almost complete bacterial inhabitants and the 
corresponding number of OTUs (Fig. S2(b)). The analysis of hier-
archical clustering was used to show the divergence in the structure of bacterial communities in three samples, as shown in Fig. S2 
3.4.2. Diversity and bacterial communities structure analysis
In this study, the 16S rDNA gene replicas investigation was directed 
to measure the microbial community structure in the 3D-BER 
system. Nevertheless, the bacterial community diversity character-istic of the original sludge (OS), the inner surface (IS), and bottom 
surface (BS) of immobilized GAC carriers were listed in Table 
S2. A total of 68614-82,006 useful sequences were achieved, after 
the quality control process of raw sequence data. The 891-1085 
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered at 98.8% sim-
ilarity index, and the sequencing results were shown a reasonable replication of microbial diversity. Adequate coverage was relatively 
close to 1. The value of Alpha ( α) diversity of Simpson and Shannon 
index reduced in the inner surface (IS), except for the AceI index, which increased OS and BS samples tendency. It was revealed 
that the concentration of significant functional microorganisms 
occurred in IS. Then, the diversity of microbial communities did not change significantly in the OS and BS samples. More than 
50,000  go od rea ds w ere obtained  in the seq uence data pro cessing 
system. Similarly, AceI and ChaoI index indicated an accumulative trend subsequently OS, IS, and BS samples showing the OTUs 
abundance was significantly higher in the IS area of GAC biofilm 
carriers, the changes consistent to the variations in the OTUs numbers. This can be attributed to the low concentration of NO
3--N 
removal and the fact that MLSS was relatively stable during the 
whole operating period.
Fig. 6(a) and 6(b) show  the relative microbial abundance at 
the genus and phyla levels in three samples through taxonomic 
analysis. At the genus level, the most important group of bacteria i n  t h e  I S  s a m p l e  w a s  Thauera, Geobacter, Desulfomicrobium, 
Sporomusa,  and Denitratisoma , presenting for 40.06%, 35.45%, 
2.81%, 4.59%, and 2.51% of reads, respectively. Similarly, at the phylum level, the most abundant bacterial population in the IS 
sample was Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gracilibacteria, 
Tenericutes,  and Firmicutes  were presenting for 69.01%, 15.88%, 
8.48%, 7.16%, and 2.12% of reads, the domain phylum found in 
three samples, respectively [65]. As a result, phylum Proteobacteria  
play an important role in the denitrification process of immobilized GAC particles, meaning that the 3D-BERs exhibited excellent nitrate 
removal performance in the OS, IS, and BS biofilm GAC samples. 
In contrast, it was auxiliary copious in IS samples (69.01%) com-pared to OS sample (49.8%), and BS samples (60.16%) [11]. On 
the GAC biofilm surface of carriers, Proteobacteria , Geobacter,  
Bacteroidetes,  and Thauera  were the dominants, accounting for 
69.01%, 35.45%, 15.88%, and 40.06%, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 6(c), Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, 
Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, Bacilli, Clostridia, Methanobacteria and Erysipelotrichia were preponderant classes in OS, IS, and BS 
samples [11, 38, 66]. These results indicated that the changes of 
bacterial community structure stuck between IS and BS sample was different, however; in the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria 
accounted for 9.86%, 37.64% and 18.07% in OS, IS and BS samples, 
respectively. Gammaproteobacteria [66], Deltaproteobacteria,  and 
Bacilli  were compared to the immobilized GAC biofilm carrier Mahdi Hassan et al.
10in BS zone, it was abundantly present in the IS zone [41, 66] . 
Deltaproteobacteria  was the dominant class in the nitrate-based 
heterotrophic-autotrophic denitrification system [46].  Deltaproteobacteria 
accounted for more than 37.64% of the bacteria in the different 
phases, while Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, 
Bacilli, Clostridia, Methanobacteria and Erysipelotrichia constituted 
more than 5%.  Corresponding to the previous study,  
Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, Bacilli, and Clostridia were pre-
dominant class and played a critical role in the heterotrophic de-
nitrification system [66, 67].  
As shown in  Table S2 that the IS immobilized GAC biofilm 
of the carrier possessed higher bacterial community diversity and 
richness. The immobilized GAC biofilm supports can protect mi-
crobes, bacterial-resistance, and ot her improved species with giant 
inhabitants sustained in the inner surface or middle region of carriers 
[67]. Deltaproteobacteria and  Proteobacteria  were the leading bacte-
r ia l in h a b it a n t s  p l a c e d  in  th e  I S  z o n e  o f  c a r r i e r s  [6 8 ] .  R e c e n t l y , Proteobacteria  and Bacteroidetes  can reduce nitrates and nitrites 
for the whole period of denitrification were studied in an anoxic 
condition [20, 68]. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes 
were the  predominant phylum in this reactor [65] and often con-
tributed to the denitrification process [16, 68]. Similar results have 
been obtained by Wang et al. [69], the denitrification system phylum delimited Firmicutes and Proteobacteria,  confirmed that 
Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were shown to have potential  nitrate 
removal capabilities [70]. Deinococcus-Thermus from another study 
that Proteobacteria,  Chloroflexi,  and Tenericutes were the predom-
inant microorganisms in a traditional biofilm-electrode reactor [57], 
wherever the Proteobacteria played significant roles in the perform-
ance of denitrification in the biofilm reactor [49, 58]. It has been 
reported that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, and 
Hydrogenedentes bacteria  have a tendency to subsist in the anaerobic 
environment using organic nutrients and fatty acids source [17, 
24, 68]. Therefore, in an anaerobic environment, the 3D-BER system 
with the GAC biofilm carriers may expedite Proteobacteria  bacteria 
survival  in the samples of original sludge, Inner surface, and bottom 
surface.
The microorganisms disturbed in the mycelium making networks 
[57], which can improve microbes capability to prevent the environ-
mental variations and auxiliary carbon sources, play a vital role 
in municipal wastewater treatment systems [21]. According to the above-mentioned experimental findings, the essential denitrifiers 
Pseudomonas and diverse microbial communities contribute to 
the comprehensive removal of nitrate [52, 58]. In addition, the dominant communities were the biofilm GAC inner surface where 
Firmicutes  and Proteobacteria  may be the primary reasons for de-
nitrification of the GAC immobilised bacteria. Denitrification proc-esses mainly occurred in the IS anoxic condition, prominent to 
the presence of a certain mass transfer-resistance level [11, 41]. 
Accordingly, the removal rate of denitrification might be affected 
and controlled by substrate the nitrates initial concentration [52]. 
The organic carbon source in the 3D-BERs was supplemented with 
sodium acetate and sludge, and this would lead to a comparatively high-level proportion community of Proteobacteria (69.01%),  
Bacteroidetes (15.88%),  Gracilibacteria (8.48%),  in the inner surface 
or middle surface of the reactor [50, 71].
In conclusion, bacterial activity in the GAC immobilization in the 3D-BER system was favourable for treating nitrate-polluted 
water. The complete nitrate or nitrite elimination would be analyzed by transmitting substrates in the GAC biofilm-immobilized cell 
and the nitrate to nitrite reductase enzymes. The microbial commun-
ities play a significant role in the GAC immobilized carriers composi-tion with different operating parameters and in the groups dis-
tributed in the above processes. In the 3D-BER system with the 
GAC biofilm, immobilized microbial systems based on fully immobi-lized bacterial consortium provide space for various dominant mi-
crobial communities. Under the right circumstances, nitrates and 
intermediates can be efficiently removed according to a diverse microbial population. The best results of eliminating nitrogen and 
microbial community diversity in this study are enlightening for 
regulating and optimizing the GAC immobilization cell microbial communities and achieving better removal performance and needs 
for further research and application.
4. Conclusions
To effectively treat nitrate polluted water, a novel 3D-BER system 
using cooperation between autotrophic and heterotrophic de-nitrification has been developed. However, the nitrate removal 
efficiency was higher than 98% at COD/NO
3--N ratio of 1.5 with 
HRT (1.2 h). There were various types of denitrifying micro-organisms found in the 3D-BER system, which led to the removal 
performance of nitrates through denitrification processes. In the 
biofilm on the GAC particles electrode carriers of the reactor was dominated by  Bacteroidia, Bacilli, Clostridia, α-γ-δ-proteobacteria, 
Desulfomicrobium, and Sporomusa  became the main species in 
OS, IS and BS samples, respectively. The heterotrophic-autotrophic denitrification could simultaneously occur in the GAC carriers 
inner surface, where Thauera, Proteobacteria , and Firmicutes were 
the dominant microbial community. Nevertheless, with limited sludge and carbon sources, the diverse and dynamic bacterial activ-
ity composition in the treatment process can significantly improve 
the performance of the 3D-BER system and make it attractive de-nitrification for nitrate-polluted water. This research provided new 
insights into the application of the three-dimensional bio-
electrochemical reactor system, and further efforts are needed to improve the efficiency of nitrates removal and look for suitable 
material for cathode and anode.
