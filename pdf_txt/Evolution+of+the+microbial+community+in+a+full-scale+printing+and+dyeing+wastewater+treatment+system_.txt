Surfactants and bioremediation
J Anandkumar, Manisha Agrawal and Biju Prava Sahariah
Detergents, soaps, personal care products, liquid detergents, toiletries, and emulsi-
ﬁers are used daily in modern societies and are common surfactant products.
Surfactants are surface active agents that can reduce the interfacial tension of theinterface. Due to their broad physical and chemical properties, this group of
chemicals has a wide range of uses in industries such as personal care products,
pharmaceutical, agriculture, food processing, textile, laundry fungicides, pulp andpaper processing, paint industries, softeners, antistatic agents, detergents, and metal
treatment industries. There are four broad categories of surfactants, namely anionic,
cationic, zwitterionic, and nonionic, which are well studied and have growingutilization. The elements present in surfactants can signi ﬁcantly alter the quality of
aquatic bodies and the soil. They can also induce a variety of problems in
wastewater.
Microbial bioremediation is a successful option for various xenobiotics when
applied with ef ﬁcient microbes in their optimum environment. Furthermore,
metabolic activity can transform complex surfactants to simpler forms. This chapter
discusses the chemistry of dominant surfactants and their fate in the environment.
Some possible bioremediation techniques will then be suggested for a sustainableand healthy environment.
1.1 Introduction
Surfactants are chemicals, more precisely organic substances (e.g., the regular useddetergents or soaps, with the capacity to reduce the surface tension of a liquid, and
hence facilitate high spreading and wetting properties), that are used for cleaning
and softening of fabrics. The presence of one or more hydrophilic and hydrophobicgroups enables surfactants to form micelles. The intrusion and dispersion properties
of surfactants increase their use, not only in laundry but also in textile and perfume
doi:10.1088/978-0-7503-5678-7ch1 1-1 ªIOP Publishing Ltd 2024industries for dye penetration and perfume dispersion. Surfactants are also used as
corrosion regulators, ore ﬂoaters, oil ﬂow enhancers in porous materials, and aerosol
production.
1.1.1 Chemistry of surfactants
Surface active agents that are used to decrease the surface tension of water are
termed ’surfactants. ’These are chemical compounds with a micelles creating
property via self-assembled molecular clusters in a solution. The unique molecularstructure of surfactants is responsible for their amphiphilic nature and are comprised
of two parts: the ﬁrst part is made by a water loving hydrophilic group that is soluble
in water, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, and other polar groups; the second partis a lipophilic or hydrophobic group, such as alkyl, aryl, and other non-polar groups,
which are water hating in nature and insoluble in water but soluble in lipids or oils.
This property facilitates them to concentrate at the interfaces between bodies ordroplets of water and hydrophobic substances such as oil or lipids, and perform as
an emulsifying or foaming agent ( ﬁgure 1.1).
On the basis of the nature of the hydrophilic group, surfactants are classi ﬁed into
four types:
(a)Anionic surfactants: Anionic surfactants contain negative charges on their
hydrophilic head in solution and are the most commonly used surfactants,which are used in food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, detergent, and other
industries. Anionic functional groups are mainly sulfates (SO
42−), phos-
phates (PO 42−), and carboxylates (RCOO−). Some examples of anionic
surfactants are sulfates, sulfonates, and gluconates, such as Sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) C12H25NaO 4Sand Potassium oleate C18H33KO 2.They cover
50% of overall industrial production.
Uses
Textile industry : Oiling agents, dyeing auxiliaries, bleaching agents, and
soft processing agent.
Pesticides : Spraying agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersants.
Highway : Asphalt emulsi ﬁer.
Civil engineering : Water reducing agent for cement.
Petroleum industry : Emulsi ﬁers and fuel additives.
Polymer industry : Emulsi ﬁers and antistatic agents, metal cleaning
agents, mining ﬂotation agents, and water treatment agents.
(b)Cationic surfactants: Cationic surfactants contain negative charges on their
hydrophilic end. Alkyl ammonium chlorides and Quaternary Ammonium
salt ( N+R4-) are common examples of cationic surfactants. Cationic
surfactants dissociate to positively charged ions in solution, and are used
as fungicides, softeners, and antistatic agents. In general, the dosage of thecationic surfactant is less than that of the anionic surfactants. The hydro-
phobic group of cationic surfactants is composed of an alkyl group and a
functional group containing nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and so on. Atpresent, most industrial cationic surfactants are composed of nitrogenousTrends in Biological Processes in Industrial Wastewater Treatment
1-2Figure 1.1. (a)–(e) Some examples of the structure of surfactants.Trends in Biological Processes in Industrial Wastewater Treatment
1-3compounds, which are classi ﬁed into amine, quaternary ammonium,
heterocyclic, and rhodium salts. Quaternary ammonium salts (QACs) are
widely used in cationic surfactants because of their solubility in both acidsand bases. There are four functional groups that attach with a covalent
bond to the positively charged central nitrogen atom in QACs. QACs are
basically organic compounds. A long hydrophobic alkyl chain is present in
functional groups, along with other short chains such as methyl or benzyl
groups. The ingredients of ester cationic surfactants include (for example)diethyl ester dimethyl ammonium chloride (DEEDMAC). The QACs are
mostly used in pharmaceuticals (antiseptic agents), softeners (fabric soften-
ers), fungicides, preservatives, etc.
(c)Nonionic surfactants: Nonionic surfactants, as the term suggests, are neutral
in nature and cannot dissociate in solution to produce ions, they have high
stability, and they are the most commonly used type after anionicsurfactants. They do not contain any charges on their hydrophilic end.
The hydrophilic part possesses covalently bonded oxygen-containing groups
such as hydroxyl and ether bonds, which are bonded to hydrophobic parentstructures. Nonionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than
anionic surfactants. There is no or insigni ﬁcant effect of acid and alkali on
nonionic surfactants, which make them highly suitable for applications inwashing, dispersion, foaming, solubilization, and in industries such as food,
medicines, textiles, and paints. Examples of nonionic surfactants are
ethoxylates, alkoxylates, alkylphenol polyoxyethylene ether (APEO), highcarbon aliphatic alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (AEO), fatty acid polyoxy-
ethylene ester (AE), and cocamide. They comprise 45% of overall industrial
production, where they are used as wetting agents in coatings, foodingredients, cell staining, DNA extraction, and pharmaceutical experi-
ments. The major ingredients of alkylphenol polyoxyethylene ether
(APEO) are octylphenol polyoxyethylene ether and nonylphenol polyoxy-ethylene ether, composed of a polyoxyethylene chain and an alkyl chain
attached to a benzene ring. They are widely used as insecticides, emulsi ﬁers,
and solvent enhancers. Other examples are Triton X-100 (C
14H22O(C 2H4O)
n(n=9–10)) and Tergitol (C 12–14H25–29O[CH 2CH 2O]xH).
Uses:
Textile industry : Cationic surfactants are widely used as fabric softeners,
as well as the antistatic agents for chemical ﬁber oils.
Metal industry : Cationic surfactants are used as metal corrosion inhib-
itors thanks to their high ef ﬁciency, low toxicity, easy production, low price,
and the waste liquid can be used as a metal oil cleaning agent and rust
remover after cleaning.
Paper industry : Cationic surfactants can improve the strength of paper,
and the retention rate of the ﬁller and ﬁneﬁbers.
Coating industry : Cationic surfactants are mainly to evenly distribute and
disperse pigment particles.Trends in Biological Processes in Industrial Wastewater Treatment
1-4Oil industry : Cationic surfactants are used for oil viscosity reduction, oil
wellﬁxation, oil pipeline protection and sterilization.
Water puri ﬁcation industry: Cationic surfactants are used to treat
domestic sewage and industrial wastewater.
(d)Amphoteric surfactants: These surfactants are also known as zwitterionic
surfactants, whose amphoteric properties are independent of pH over a
wide pH range. They have both positive and negative charges on their
hydrophilic end with a net charge of zero. Betaines and amino oxides arecommon examples of this type of surfactant. Amphoteric surfactants
include amphoteric surfactants (amphoterics) and amphoteric ionic surfac-
tants (zwitterionics). The amphoteric surfactants are comparatively mildsurfactants and are used in daily necessities and cosmetics. Nevertheless, the
high cost and complex synthesis limits the production of amphoteric
surfactants. There are three general types of amphoteric surfactants, namelyamino acid amphoteric surfactants, betaine type amphoteric surfactants,
and imidazoline surfactants. The cationic part of betaine type amphoteric
surfactants is composed of quaternary ammonium salt, which can bedivided into carboxylate betaine, sulfobetaine, and phosphate betaine
according to different anions. The structure of the betaine type surfactants
is based on the substitution of methyl or carboxyl groups of trimethylgly-cine with different substituents, such as betaines (C
5H11NO 2) and amphoa-
cetates (RC(O)NH(CH 2)2N(CH 2CH 2OH)CH 2COONa).
Uses:These are expensive surfactants and are generally used in cosmetics,
shampoos, shower gel, hair conditioners, and toothpaste because of their
mildness, safety, and lack of irritating effects on skin and eyes.
The surfactant market is largely dominated by the nonionic surfactants,
followed by the anionic surfactants. The cationic surfactants are generally
expensive, and hence have a small share of the market. The demands forsurfactants are increasing day by day, due to their wide range of domestic
and industrial applications in many facets of daily life. Global market data
about manufacturing of surfactants shows that surfactant market size wasUSD 42.1 billion in 2020 and is predicted to will reach to USD 52.4 billion
by 2025 because of growing population and awareness about the impor-
tance of cleanliness. It is noticeable here that surfactants are an importantingredient in sanitizers and soaps. Frequent use of hand wash and soaps due
to COVID-19 led to a nearly ten times increase in demand and production
of surfactants and detergents. The brand site EVALED suggests that theformation of 800ppm detergent leads to 20ppm discharge of surfactants into
wastewater. Generally, surfactants are present in detergent industry ef ﬂu-
ents and other industrial ef ﬂuents. In addition, the residues of surfactants
are discharged into the environment, which creates many problems, e.g.,
they hinder the transfer of oxygen from the atmosphere to the water in the
process of aeration and they are accumulated in the body, which can lead tolong term problems such as carcinogenicity and loss of fertility.Trends in Biological Processes in Industrial Wastewater Treatment
1-51.1.2 Toxicity of surfactants
The unique properties and diversi ﬁed functions of surfactants have led to their
widespread use in industries such as textiles, ﬁbers, paints, polymers, plant
protection, cosmetics, mining, oil recovery, pulp and paper, agriculture, pharma-
ceuticals, food, and daily chemicals. Their extensive use is directly related to the
increased release of surfactants to the environment at levels that are suf ﬁcient to
cause detrimental effects to the soil and aquatic ecosystems. A buildup of surfactant
compounds in the soil can severely interfere with the structure and functioning of
soil microbes, resulting in several harmful effects, e.g., on photosynthesis anddamage to the root system of plants. In the case of aquatic organisms, the
accumulation of surfactant compounds in the gills and viscera of ﬁshes result in
asphyxiation leading to death. Meanwhile, exposure to surfactants in the environ-ment can lead to human diseases such as dermatitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia,
gingivitis and periodontitis, and oral ulcers. In addition, chemical species of
surfactants can interact with bodily ﬂuids through the food chain. The metabolites
nonionic surfactants APEO are identi ﬁed as environmental endocrine disruptors
that can interfere with normal hormonal function and health status in animals, and
are responsible for a decrease in sperm count in males, breast cancer, testicularcancer, and so on. Many surfactants have been shown in experiments to evade the
interaction with the protein units involved in immune system, and are hence
detrimental to health.
1.2 Treatment of surfactants
In view of the steady accumulation and negative impact of surfactants on theenvironment and population health, the removal of residual surfactants from theenvironment or conversion to non-toxic elemental compounds are important tasks.
Eliminating surfactants during production or removing residual surfactants are
required to maintain the environment and reduce potential health hazards.
The treatment process generally focuses on altering or breaking the structure of
harmful compounds in the surfactant with the help of physical –chemical –biological
forces into less harmful, elemental, and environmental-friendly compounds.Successful processes for the removal of surfactants from the environment include
adsorption, oxidation, electrolysis, electrochemical oxidation, photolysis, sonica-
tion, and biodegradation (Berna et al 2007, Christopher et al 2021).
1.2.1 Physical –chemical process
The small pores in adsorbent materials such as activated carbon, alumina, and silica
gels provide effective room for the adsorption and removal of surfactant molecules.
The parent material of the activated carbon, and the electrostatic potential of the
interface of the adsorbate and adsorbent in ﬂuence the adsorption ef ﬁciency of
pollutants (Adak et al2005, Koner et al2012, Siyal et al2020). Strong oxides such as
ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and ferric salt are capable of oxidizing surfactant
molecules through oxidation reduction reactions dissociating them into non-toxicTrends in Biological Processes in Industrial Wastewater Treatment
1-6and harmless substances. In the Fenton oxidation process, hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4) are employed to form a strong oxidizing agent
(hydroxyl radicals), which has high oxidation potential (2.8 V) compared to ozone(2.07 V). Photolysis of UV-excited hydrogen peroxide for oxidation of surfactant,
the application of non-toxic and ef ﬁcient semiconductor TiO
2, the ultrasonic
degradation of surfactant in the presence of high sound pressure, and high temper-
ature and pressure oxidation are used for surfactant removal. Electrolysis treatment
is renowned for the ef ﬁcient mineralization and removal of surfactants due to the
application of strong oxidizing substances produced on the surface of the electrodes,
such as PbO 2and boron-doped diamond (BDD). For example, galvanostatic
electrolysis using a Ti –Ru–Sn ternary oxide and a BDD anode for sodium dodecyl
benzene sulfonate and car wash wastewater; and porous graphite as anode and
cathode, with the effective CuO –Co2O3–PO43−modi ﬁed kaolin catalyst in a single
undivided cell provided ef ﬁcient anionic surfactant removal.
Though effective treatment results are achieved, oxidation, photocatalytic, and
electrochemical treatment are relatively costly methods and either require secondary
waste handling or consume more energy, and some of the processes with nosecondary waste are associated with low treatment rate.
1.2.2 Bioremediation
Bioremediation involves mechanisms such as biosorption, biodegradation, bioaccu-
mulation, and bioleaching for pollutant removal. Bioremediation includes phytor-
emediation (rhizodegradation, phytoextraction, phytovolatilization,phytodegradation, rhizo ﬁltration, and rhizostabilization), mycoremediation, micro-
bial remediation (bacteria, fungi, and microalgae), and phyco-remediation.
In biosorption, and bioaccumulation, pollutants are immobilized inside or out-
side a microbial cell equipped with extracellular polysaccharide substances (EPS)
and through the secretion of various organic acids. Similarly, bioleaching involves
numerous organic acids and enzyme secretions for pollutant extraction andprocessing according to the properties of the pollutants and the microbes. The
biodegradation of surfactants biodegradation agents that derive their required life
sustaining energy and nutrients from dissociating the chemical bonds in thesurfactants while converting the latter to non-toxic elements. Biodegradation is
highly prominent in the case of microbial, algae, and a few plant species
(phytoremediation). Biotic and abiotic factors of the environment play a key rolein the bioremediation technique. Biotic factors incorporate genetic and enzymatic
molecules and properties that govern the physical and functional interactions of
organisms and surfactants. Cell wall component orientation and secretion of speci ﬁc
enzymes, organic acids, EPS, and formation of bio ﬁlm are principal features that
inﬂuence the performance ef ﬁciency of biotic factors. The abiotic factors mainly
include temperature, pH, moisture, and bioavailability of surfactants together with
nutrients ratios. Electron acceptors, mostly oxygen in aerobic biodegradation and
nitrate/sulfate in anoxic conditions, signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuence treatment ef ﬁciency.Trends in Biological Processes in Industrial Wastewater Treatment
1-7In this chapter, the microbial process is emphasized for surfactant biodegradation. A
number of microbes, which are tiny unicellularorganismsassociated with biodegradation,
form a heterogeneous colony or mixed culture of different species in nature. In completetreatment, the mineralization of surfactants to carbon dioxide and water occurs via
microbial metabolism, which is a factor of species involved in the biodegradation,
environmentalconditions,andpropertyofthe surfactantstoberemoved.Afewfrequently
noted microbial species for surfactant biodegradation are Acinetobacter ,Aeromonas ,
Comamonas ,Dechloromonas ,Desulfovibrio ,Geobacter ,Holophaga ,Parvibaculum ,
Pseudomonas ,Sporomusa ,Stenotrophomonas ,Variovorax ,a n d Zoogloea .
Owing to the complex chemical structure of surfactants, degradation may follow
a series of phases where the initial or parent surfactant compound is changed whilelosing its original structure, and hence surface activation properties. These inter-
mediates are then processed by another group of microbes for rapid and complete
mineralization, resulting in water, CO
2, mineral salt, and other inorganic substances,
while avoiding secondary pollution.
The dissociation property of polar group de ﬁnes the classi ﬁcation of surfactants
as cationic, nonionic, and amphoteric, while the hydrophobic group determines thebiodegradability to a great extent. It is also common to note that different
surfactants have utterly different biodegradability.
1.3 Biodegradation mechanism of surfactants
The prominent ways to degrade surfactants with microorganisms are ω-oxidation, β-
oxidation, α-oxidation, and benzene ring oxidation under the catalysis reactions of
various enzymes. The microbes consider the pollutants (here surfactants) as a carbonsource for their survival. In ω-oxidation,terminal alcohol is generated from alkyl
chains via ω-oxidation in the presence of alkane monooxygenase. This is followed by
sequential production of terminal aldehyde and the carboxylic acid in the presenceof two kinds of dehydrogenases enzymes.
In the case of β-oxidation, the carboxyl groups generated by ω-oxidation of the
alkyl chain in ﬂuence β-oxidation in continuation of degradation of the alkyl chain.
The signi ﬁcant enzymes are coenzyme A, dehydrogenase, and hydrolytic enzyme.
Benzene ring oxidation, especially the links, is considered as the speed control step
of surfactants containing benzene rings. The most in ﬂuential enzyme is oxygenase.
The intermediates are catechol, hexadiene diacid, acetic acid, succinic acid, 2-
hydroxyhexadiene semialdehyde acid, and ﬁnally formic acid, acetaldehyde, and
pyruvic acid.
1.3.1 Bioremediation of anionic surfactants
The common anionic surfactants are linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), alkyl
sulfonate (AS), and alcohol ether sulfate. LAS is a widely used surfactant, comprised
of 20 or more homologues isomers and accounts for more than quarter share amongthe synthetic surfactants. The toxicity of LAS is generally mild and shows no
accumulation in organisms. The biodegradation of LAS is highly ef ﬁcient at all of
the basic environment of anaerobic/aerobic or facultative conditions and relevant toTrends in Biological Processes in Industrial Wastewater Treatment
1-8its molecular structure for biodegradation. In anaerobic and aerobic conditions,
LAS follows a degradation pathway with aromatic ring cleavage, desulfonation,
beoxidation reactions, and ueoxidation reactions. The existing distance of thebenzene ring with the central carbon atom determines the stability of the structure,
i.e., when the distance is larger, there is more instability in the structure, which
comprises the feasibility of degradation. The degradation of LAS by microorgan-
isms is initiated by the breakdown of alkyl chain, which results in the generation of
carboxylic acid by ω-oxidation of the terminal methyl group. This is followed by
formation of acetyl-coenzyme A through β-oxidation, and hence enters the tricar-
boxylic acid cycle releasing CO
2and mineral salts, which are the ﬁnal products of
the benzene rings. Owing to the complexity of the degradation of the benzene ring, itis regarded as the rate limiting element of LAS biodegradation. The literature
recognizes more than 47 genera of microbes that are capable of LAS degradation,
with almost 30 genera that are capable of aromatic ring cleavage, often denoted asaromatic compounds degraders. Desulfonation reactions are achieved by the species
of seven genera, namely Achromobacter ,Acinetobacter ,Aeromonas ,Comamonas ,
Desulfovibrio ,Hydrogenophaga and Pseudomonas , and species of ﬁve prominent
genera, namely Geobacter ,Magnetospirilium ,Parvibaculum ,Pseudomonas and
Synergistes , which are recognized for beoxidation reactions. Parvibaculum and
Pseudomonas genera includes a few species that are capable of ueoxidation
reactions. Several microbes from Acinetobacter ,Aeromonas ,Comamonas ,
Dechloromonas ,Desulfovibrio ,Geobacter ,Holophoga ,Pseudomonas ,Sporomusa ,
Stenotrophomonas ,Variovorax and Zoogloea genera are recognized for LAS
degradation (Okada et al 2014). Aerobic treatment systems include a supply of
molecular oxygen. The activated sludge process can provide more than 90% or even
complete removal of LAS. Similarly, anaerobic processes (absence of oxygen) in theupﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket also exhibit very ef ﬁcient treatment ef ﬁciency for
LAS. A few signi ﬁcant strains that are capable of degrading LAS are Pseudomonas
nitroreducens ,Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,Pantoea agglomerans , and Serratia odor-
ifera 2 . Each strain has speci ﬁc preferences for degradation conditions, and hence
exhibit different degradation times and rates. Therefore, achieving successful treat-
ment depends on the selection of ef ﬁcient species and the providision of their
favorable conditions.
A few more of the commonly utilized anionic surfactants, namely AS and SDS,
are also swiftly biodegradable. The biodegradation of AS is accomplished by de-vulcanization of sulfate esterase and β-oxidation of aliphatic alcohols. Pseudomonas
putida R1
,Acinetobacter calcoaceticus , and Pantoea agglomerans can completely
degrade SDS into water and carbon dioxide by microorganisms.
1.3.2 Cationic surfactants
In the biodegradation of cationic surfactants, QACs are governed by the molecular
structure of the same, the concentration of the surfactants, and the resistance of
microorganisms to the surfactants. During QAC degradation, microbes generallyfollow three distinct pathways depending on the strain and surfactant, initiated withTrends in Biological Processes in Industrial Wastewater Treatment
1-9the hydroxylation of the alkyl chain, and then goes through ω-oxidation and β-
oxidation, which results in acetyl coenzyme A for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In the
second pathway, there is partial hydroxylation of alkyl chain, which is trailed withpartial cleavage of the C-N bond under the action of the enzyme, and ﬁnally the
degradation is completed by β-oxidation. In the third pathway of cationic surfactant
degradation, hydroxylation long chain alkyl is accompanied with demethylation of
methyl carbon. A few QAC degradation ef ﬁcient strains are Pseudomonas sp.,
Xanthomonas sp.,Thalassospira sp., and Aeromonas sp. The strong germicidal effect
and soothing absorbance of QACs in the sediment, minerals, or organic matter with
positive charge in wastewater makes biodegradation more challenging.
1.3.3 Nonionic surfactants
The length and complexity of the alkyl chain, and the number of elements in the
benzene ring and polyoxyethylene chain mostly in ﬂuence the biodegradation of
APEO, which is an ideal nonionic surfactant. The branched chain structure and
higher units in polyoxyethylene chain add to the dif ﬁculties of biodegradation.
Microorganisms break the long chains to short polyoxyethylene chains, octylphenol,
and nonylphenol. The higher toxicity of the intermediates/metabolites, such as
octylphenol and nonylphenol, than the parent compound APEO demand completebiodegradation. A few strains ef ﬁcient in degradation of APEO are Pseudomonas
sp.,Moraxella osloensis, Cupriavidus sp., and Brevibacterium sp.TX4. Oxidation of
terminal hydroxyl group, a single unit of polyoxyethylene chain, to carboxylic acid isfollowed by its removal, which is the initiation of APEO biodegradation.
Alkylphenols are highly resistant to microbial degradation. Two different
mechanisms are recognized by different microorganisms to degrade it. The ﬁrst
mechanism includes hydroxylation under the action of microbial enzymes, resulting
in cleavage of alkyl chains and phenols, followed by subsequent degradation by
microorganisms. The second mechanism includes formation of alkyl catecholthrough phenol hydroxylase, followed by the cleavage of an aromatic ring by the
action of dioxygenase, which is readily biodegradable.
The higher toxicity of the intermediates generated from APEo result in a gradual
decrease or banning and increasing demand of aliphatic alcohol polyoxyethylene
ether (AEO). AEO consists of numerous congeners, containing an alkyl chain of 12 –
18 carbon atoms connected to a polyoxyethylene chain of different unit count, whichis widely used in decontamination, cleaning, care, and other industries. Strains such
asPseudomonas aerugirosa ,Pseudomonas stutzeri , and Flavobacterium sp. are able
to degrade AEO, where initially the ether bonds between the alkyl chain and thepolyoxyethylene chain are broken to generate fatty acids and polyethylene glycols,
and a few other metabolites for degradation.
1.3.4 Amphoteric surfactants
Betaine type surfactants are relatively easy to biodegrade and their primary
biodegradation rate can reach 100%. Strains capable of degrading betaine surfac-
tants include Desulfobacterium ,Eubacterium limosum , and Sporomusa ovata .Trends in Biological Processes in Industrial Wastewater Treatment
1-101.4 Factors affecting the biodegradation of surfactants
The length and branching degree of alkyl chains, the chemical structures of
surfactants, along with the number of units of polymers, benzene rings, and their
location speci ﬁcally govern the biodegradability of a surfactant. In addition, the type
and population strength, as well as diversity highly in ﬂuence biodegradation. High
adaptability, mixed culture, or high diversity are favored for high degradation of
surfactants in favorable environmental conditions.
1.5 Conclusions
Surfactants have many uses, such as domestic cleaners and soap, and in the
pharmaceutical, agricultural, food, medicine, and other industries. Despite their
use for hygiene and as detergents, the complex structure of surfactants can causethem to become toxic in the environment when they buildup. Fortunately, there are
efﬁcient treatment processes to handle waste surfactants. Bioremediation can over-
come the drawbacks of these processes, such as generation of secondary wastegeneration, in physical-chemical processes and is facilitated by numerous micro-
organisms equipped with different types of cellular molecules and enzymes that are
speci ﬁcally required for breaking the chemical bonds in surfactants. Microbes follow
different pathways for biodegradation for different surfactants, as well as type of
microbes. Nature has many microbes whose potential is yet to be recognized, and
many pollutants and chemicals are released everyday whose removal and degrada-tion is yet to be understood. Therefore, analysis by biologists, bioinformaticians, and
chemists will help to develop solutions for these environmental hazards.
