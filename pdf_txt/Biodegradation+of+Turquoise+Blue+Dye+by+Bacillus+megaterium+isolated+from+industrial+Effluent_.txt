Editorial on the Research Topic
Advanced Bioremediation Technologies and Processes for the Treatment of Synthetic Organic
Compounds
Synthetic organic compounds (SOCs) are the primary pollutants of aquatic and terrestrial
ecosystems. This group of chemicals includes pesticides, herbicides, and pharmaceutical
products and their transformed products; industrial chemicals (such as plasticizers, dyes, and
dye intermediates), organophosphate and brominated ﬂame retardants, volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) (i.e., organic solvents), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, per- and poly ﬂuoroalkyl
substances (PFAS), plastic polymers, and many more ( Tijani et al., 2016 ;Ahmed et al., 2018 ;
Ilyas and van Hullebusch, 2020 ). The SOCs are commonly found in urban wastewater, agricultural
runoffs, and industrial waste streams ( Postigo and Barceló, 2015 ). SOCs pollute various habitats
through diffusion or as point source pollutants. SOCs exert multi-dimensional effects in the pollutedenvironment by altering the physicochemical properties of the habitats where they are released,representing a threat to humanity ( Naidu et al., 2021 ). The environmental distribution and
persistence of many SOCs were previously unknown, but with the development of newerdetection methods, SOCs have been found in the environment at much higher concentrations.
Due to their bio-toxic properties, many SOCs are now recognized as priority pollutants, requiring
immediate solutions for their removal from polluted ecosystems (Lohmann et al., 2007 ;Walker,
2019 ).
Soon after realizing the adverse effects of SOCs on the biosphere, different treatment technologies
and processes, including hybrid integrated systems, have been developed. Due to the exponential risein the generation of SOCs, and concomitant heterogeneous compositions of these xenobiotics in thepolluted environment, traditional treatment technologies were found to have varying degrees ofefﬁcacy. The accumulating volume and heterogeneity of the xenobiotic wastes that are generated are
the driving force for the emergence of next-generation technologies in waste treatment. In recentyears, promising multi-dimensional treatment technologies have been developed such as hybridintegrated treatment systems coupling biological and physicochemical processes, membrane
bioreactors, microbial electrochemical technologies, phyto-reactors, in-situ treatment methods
(e.g., bioventing, biostimulation, and bioaugmentation), novel pre-treatment approaches, and
innovative bioreactor/bioprocess designs for treatment of SOCs ( Jain et al., 2020 ;Trellu et al., 2020 ).
Therefore the aim of this Research Topic is to collate the recent advances in the development of
bioremediation processes and technologies for the treatment of synthetic organic compoundsEdited and reviewed by:

5(SOCs). This research topic has published thirteen articles
including six original studies, one brief research report, andsix review articles (including one systematic review paper).
In their review, Mishra et al . explain the remarkable role of
microorganisms and their catabolic potential, with genes,enzymes, and degradation pathways, in the biodegradationprocess of xenobiotic compounds. The successful execution ofomics technologies with bioinformatics tools shows the wayto next-level research in the bioremediation potential ofmicroorganisms and exploits their capability to removexenobiotic contamination.
Another review article (by Arora) described the competence of
the genus Bacillus for the degradation of xenobiotic compounds
along with the detoxi ﬁcation of potentially toxic metals.
The author has listed 154 species of Bacillus and reported
their use in the biodegradation and biotransformation ofvarious pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides along withchlorophenol, nitrophenol, and chloronitrophenol, thedecolorization and biotransformation of dye compounds, thebiodegradation of different polycyclic and heterocyclicaromatic hydrocarbons, explosives, drugs, natural aromaticcompounds, and other xenobiotic compounds like crudeoils, plastic bags, etc., and the detoxi ﬁcation of potentially
toxic metals. Several advanced technologies, like genome-editing tools used in bioremediation, have been also discussed.The author concludes that the construction of a genetically
engineered Bacilli strain or genomic editing tool will help in
developing ef ﬁcient Bacillus strains for bioremediation.
Surkatti et al . studied the organic degrading bacteria from gas-
to-liquid process water (GTL). They have isolated and identi ﬁed
the native bacteria from GTL process water, which were furtherused for biodegradation of organic contaminants from localGTL process water. The authors have used techniques fromthree areas of environmental microbiology and biochemistryalong with bioremediation. Three distinct bacterial speciesnamely, Alcaligenes faecalis ,Stenotrophomonas sp. and
Ochrobactrum sp. were identi ﬁed. They observed that the
bioremediation potential of mixed bacterial strains was muchbetter than the three individual strains, though individually thetreatment ef ﬁciency reached up to 60% reduction in chemical
oxygen demand (COD).
Mahapatra and Phale provide insights into the ecological
aspects of ﬁeld application and microbial strain optimization
for efﬁ cient bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) following a system biology approach. In another reviewbyShahsavari et al. the chemical properties, sources, and fate of
per- and poly ﬂuoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination in the
environment are discussed. This review systematically addresses
the current status of PFAS biodegradation as well as challenges
faced in their remediation.
Plastics or Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) have been one of
the major global pollutants for last the several years. Due to itshighly recalcitrant properties, its natural turnover rate in theenvironment is negligible. In an experimental study, Dey et al.
demonstrated the degradation of LDPE using an enrichedmicrobial community. The culturable portion of the communityconsists of Stenotrophomonas sp. and Achromobacter sp. The
microbial growth in presence of LDPEs, high cell surfacehydrophobicity of the microbial community, and substantialweight reduction of the treated LDPEs were the primary
indicators that signi ﬁed plastic degradation.
Maurya et al. reviewed the current research on enzymatic
remediation of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) based
polymers. The review provides a brief overview of the variousapproaches of biocatalysis used for effective recycling of PET,along with the factors affecting the hydrolysis rate and thechallenges faced during this step. The authors suggest thatfurther research should be focused on identifying thermostablePET-hydrolyzable enzymes capable of hydrolyzing hcPET withbroad substrate speci ﬁcity.
Dhakar et al. have demonstrated the construction of a genome-
scale metabolic model following automatic and manual protocolsand its application for improving metabolic potential throughinteractive simulations. In an experimental study, Ferreira et al.
studied the phytoremediation ef ﬁciency of four plant species for
soil samples contaminated with Tebuthiuron (herbicides) and theeffect of vinasse during the treatment.
In a review by Jaiswal et al. SOC management from paper mill/
pulp industrial ef ﬂuents is discussed in detail. Authors have
described various SOCs present in pulping and paperprocessing efﬂ uents. The review describes various methods to
reduce SOC production from pulp and paper industries, and their
treatment strategies were also discussed in brief along with their
challenges and limitations.
It further describes the
biotechnological applications such as genetically modi ﬁed
biological agents for sustainable remediation of SOCs frompaper industries.
In a brief research report by Mazioti et al. treatment of real
bilge wastewater with zero valent iron (ZVI) and activatedcharcoal using three different biological methods: (i) anaerobicdigestion with granular sludge and ZVI addition for enhancementof methane production, (ii) activated charcoal addition tobiological treatment (aerobic and anaerobic) for signi ﬁcant
reduction of COD, and (iii) combination of ZVI andanaerobic charcoal addition for high-performance treatment.The study found that a combination of ZVI and activatedcharcoal could have greater bioremediation performanceamongst the three approaches used for the treatment of realbilge wastewater.
In a research article on total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH)
degradation, Garousin et al. have accessed various methods of
bioremediation (i.e., bio-stimulated microcosm, bacterializedmicrocosm, combinatorial approach of bio-stimulatedmicrocosm and bacterialized microcosm, and natural
attenuation) using Bacillus altitudinis HRG-1 in age-old
petroleum contaminated soils. The study reports that a
combination of bio-stimulated microcosm and bacterializedmicrocosm was the most effective method, where 38.2% TPHwas reduced under experimental conditions over a 60-day period.The author concludes that biostimulation alone was insuf ﬁcient,
and that proper application of suitable microbes is essential toreduce the contaminant load from polluted soils.
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org September 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 721319 2Jain et al. Editorial: Advanced Bioremediation Technologies for SOCs
6Askri et al. through their experimental study,
demonstrated that bioelectricity can be generated during
the treatment of real textile ef ﬂuents using microbial
halothermotolerant bioanodes from hypersaline sediment
and textile dyeing wastewater. The authors claimed to
produce a reproducible bioelectric current of about 12.5 ±0.
2A / m2with a simultaneous reduction in COD with 91 ±3%
efﬁciency.
This research topic highlights the microbial degradation
of various SOCs by different approaches, includingintegrated methods. The technologies reported includetraditional bioremediation a pproaches using pure microbial
cultures as well as mixed cultures, integrated biologicaltreatment, and advanced phytoremediation approaches, aswell as genomics and metabolic studies to understand the
biodegradation of SOCs. This research topic also discusses
the current status of the research advances in the treatment ofSOCs, the limitations and challenges for effectiveremoval of SOCs, and offers a direction for future researchin achieving optimal biotechnological solutions in thetreatment of SOCs.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Xenobiotic compounds are man-made compounds and widely used in dyes, drugs,
pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, explosives, and other industrial chemicals. These
compounds have been released into our soil and water due to anthropogenic activities
and improper waste disposal practices and cause serious damage to aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystems due to their toxic nature. The United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) has listed several toxic substances as priority pollutants.
Bacterialremediationisidentiﬁedasanemergingtechniquetoremovethesesubstances
from the environment. Many bacterial genera are actively involved in the degradation
of toxic substances. Among the bacterial genera, the members of the genus Bacillus
have a great potential to degrade or transform various toxic substances. Many Bacilli
have been isolated and characterized by their ability to degrade or transform a wide
range of compounds including both naturally occurring substances and xenobiotic
compounds. This review describes the biodegradation potentials of Bacillitoward
various toxic substances, including 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol, insecticides, pesticides,
herbicides, explosives, drugs, polycyclic aromatic compounds, heavy metals, azo dyes,
and aromatic acids. Besides, the advanced technologies used for bioremediation
of environmental pollutants using Bacilliare also brieﬂy described. This review will
increase our understanding of Bacilli-mediated degradation of xenobiotic compounds
and heavy metals.

INTRODUCTION
The genus Bacillusbelongs to the family Bacillaceae that comprises of 293 species/subspecies
(Patel and Gupta, 2020). This genus is characterized by a group of rod-shaped, Gram-positive,
aerobic
,orfacultativelyanaerobic,endospore-formingbacteria(PatelandGupta,2020).Members
of t
he genus Bacillusare ubiquitous; they have been isolated from a variety of sources including
soil, sewage sludge (Demharter and Hensel, 1989), ocean sediments (Ruger et al., 2000), saline
water (Smibert
and Krieg, 1994). They have the exceptional ability to grow very rapidly in high
densities
aswellastotolerateadverseenvironmentalconditions.Thegenus Bacillusincludesboth
non-pathogenic (free-living) and pathogenic (parasitic) species. Few examples of non-pathogenic
speciesare Bacillussubtilis, B.licheniformis, B.amyloliquefaciens,and B.pumilus,whichareclosely
relatedtoeachother.Thepathogenicstrainsinclude B.anthracis,whichcausesanthracisinhuman
beingsand B.cereusthatcausesfoodpoisoning( ClausandBerkeley,1986).
8Arora Bacilli-Mediated Degradation
Bacilliconstitute a versatile group of bacteria, which
ha
ve many applications in the ﬁeld of health, environment,
and agriculture. They produce several secondary metabolites
including antibiotics and biosurfactants (Caulier et al., 2019).
Furthermore
, they are potential sources of industrial enzymes
including lipases, proteases, alpha-amylase, and the BamH1
restriction enzyme ( Latorre et al., 2016). Few species of Bacillus
including B.
thuringiensis, and some strains of B. sphaericus
have insecticidal properties (Palma et al., 2014). Using the
genetic engineering
approach, the genes encoding insecticidal
proteinsin B.thuringiensis havebeenincorporatedintocornand
cotton plants to generate insect-resistance genetically modiﬁed
crops (Jouzani et al., 2017). Some Bacillusspecie s are ideal
candidates for biological control due to their antagonistic
activities against fungal and some bacterial pathogens (Wulﬀ
etal.,
2002).
Bacilliare
considered as potential bioremediator agents,
which are capable of degrading several toxic substances (Arora
et al.,
2016; Singh and Singh, 2016; Xiao et al., 2017). Earlier
studies
havealsobeenreporteddegradationofvariousxenobiotic
compounds and heavy metals by the members of genus Bacillus
(Birolli et al., 2016; Upadhyay et al., 2017; Arora et al.,
2018; Díe

strains of B. thuringiensis andB. subtilis from the
rhizosphere of Panicum aquaticum. Both of these strains were
able to utilize petroleum hydrocarbons as their sole source
of carbon and energy. Bonifer et al. (2019) reported that B.
pumilusB12 de
grades poly-lactic acid that is the second most
common biodegradable polymer found in commercial plastics.
The transformation of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol was extensively
studied in many Bacilli(Arora et al., 2018). The ability of
Bacillito
degrade polycyclic aromatic compounds, drugs, dyes,
explosives have also been reported in the literature (Singh
and Sing
h, 2016; Górny et al., 2019). These data indicated
thatB
acilliplay a signiﬁcant role in the biodegradation of
toxicsubstances.
So far, several reviews have been published dealing with
the biotechnological application of Bacilli(Bunk et al., 2010;
Kumar et
al., 2013; Jouzani et al., 2017; Sansinenea, 2019 ).
Kumar et al. (2013) reviewed the signiﬁcance of Bacilli
for
the production of biofuels, polyhydroxyalkanoates, and
bioactive molecules. Sansinenea and Ortiz (2011) described
the import
ance of secondary metabolites produced by Bacilli.
Bunk et al. (2010) summarized the industrial applications
ofBac
illus megateriunm and other Bacilli.Sansinenea (2019)
discussed the plant growth-promoting activities of Bacilli .
Even though Bacill iare highly involved in biodegradation
of various natural and xenobiotic compounds, a review
on the biodegradation potential of Bacilliis rare. In the
last decade, several researchers have been investigated the
degradation abilities of Bacillitoward many toxic compounds.
This review aims to summarize the role of Bacilliin the
biodegradation process of various xenobiotic compounds and
heavymetals.ROLE OF BACILLUS SPECIES IN
BIODEGRADATION
Table1summarizes the role of various Bacilliin biodegradation
of dyes, pesticides, herbicides, chlorophenols, nitrophenols,
chloronitrophenols, heavy metals, drugs, explosives, crude oil
waste, plastics, alkaline lignin, and other natural compounds.
Oneofthefollowingprocessesmayinvolveinthedegradationof
toxiccompoundsby Bacilli:(i)Completemineralizationoftoxic
compounds, (ii)Co-metabolism of xenobiotics compounds. The
mineralizationinvolvescompleteutilizationoftoxiccompounds
by aBacillusstrain which utilized them as its sole source of
carbon energy and converts them into CO 2and water ( Arora
et al.,
2018). In the co-metabolism, Bacillitrans form chemical
compounds into other compounds which generally less toxic
than parent compounds. Co-metabolism-based bioremediation
is a non-growth linked biological process in which bacteria
convert environmental pollutants to other substances in the
presence of carbon source or growth substrate (Hazen, 2010).
In t
his process, bacteria do not depend on the pollutants for
growth and use non-speciﬁc enzymes to degrade environmental
pollutants that do not support their growth ( Hazen, 2010).
In t
his section, the biodegradation potential of Bacilli
toward a variety of xenobiotic compounds and heavy metals
isdiscussed.
Bacilli-Mediated Degradation of
4-Chloro-2-Nitrophenol
4-Chloro-2-nitrophenol is a chloro derivative of nitrophenol
that is widely used for the synthesis of dyes, pesticides, drugs,
and chemicals ( Arora et al., 2018). Due to its wide range of
applications,
this compound has been detected in a variety of
sources including industrial eﬄuents. It is highly toxic to living
beings and may cause methemoglobinemia in human beings. So
far, several physicochemical and biological methods have been
used for the 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol degradation (Bruhn et al.,
1988; Beunink
and Rehm, 1990; Saritha et al., 2007; Gharbani
et al., 2010; Hashemi et al., 2017; Arora et al., 2018 ). In this sub-
section,
theroleof Bacillusspeciesinthe4-chloro-2-nitrophenol
degradationissummarized.
ManyBacillihave been characterized for their ability to
decolorize the yellow color of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol in the
presence of additional carbon source (Arora et al., 2018). A
marine b
acterium, Bacillussp. MW-1 (Arora and Jain, 2012),
and a
soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis RKJ 700 (Arora, 2012)
decolorized
and transformed 4-chloro-4-nitrophenol into 5-
chloro-2-methylbenzoxazole via detoxiﬁcation mechanism. In
this mechanism, 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol initially reduced to 4-
chloro-2-aminophenol, which is further acetylated to 4-chloro-
2-acetaminophenol. The next step involves the conversion of
4-chloro-2-acetaminophenol to 5-chloro-2-methylbenzoxazole
(Figure1). Recently, ten bacterial strains belonging to Bacillus
isolated from a wastewater sample showed decolorization of
4-chloro-2-nitrophenol in the presence of glucose. One of
a bacterium, identiﬁed as Bacillus aryabhattai strain PC-7

Beside
sBacillusspp., several other bacteria are also capable
of transforming 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol to 5-chloro-2-
methylbenzoxazole. These bacteria belong to the genera
Pseudomonas,Leuconostoc,and Paenibacillus (Aroraetal.,2016).
The membere
s of genus Bacilluswere unable to completely
mineralize 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol, but they transformed
4-chloro-2-nitrophenol via a detoxiﬁcation mechanism.
The complete degradation of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenolwas studied using an Exiguobacterium sp. PMA (Arora

Alcaligenes sp. TK-2 (Beunink and Rehm, 1990), and the

Bacilli-Mediated
Degradation of Polycyclic
Aromatic Hydrocarbons
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are those aromatic
compounds which contain two or more fused aromatic
rings in linear, angular, or cluster arrangements ( Masih and

Taneja, 2006). Examples are naphthalene, anthracene, ﬂuorene,
phenanthrene
, ﬂuoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene
(Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016). PAHs are toxic to the
living world
and some of them are considered as possible
carcinogens. Therefore, the USEPA has listed 16 PAHS in
its priority list of pollutants (Zelinkova and Wenzl, 2015).
Major
sources of PAHs pollution include fuel combustion,automobiles, spillage of petroleum products, waste incinerators,
and industrial eﬄuents (Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016). In
thisse
ction,the Bacilli-mediated degradation of a few PAHs
issummarized.
Naphthalene is the simplest example of polycyclic aromatic
compounds. An early study on naphthalene degradation by
B. cereus ATCC14579 showed the complete transformation of
naphthalene to 1-naphthol ( Cerniglia et al., 1984). A possible
degrad
ationpathwayofnaphthalenewasstudiedin B.fusiformis
BFN that was isolated from oil reﬁning wastewater sludge
(Lin et al., 2010). The naphthalene degradation was initiated
with
1, 2-dioxygenation, resulting in the formation of cis-
1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene that dehydrogenated
to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. The ortho-ring cleavage of
1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene produced o-phthalic acid via the
formation of trans-2-carboxybenzalpyruvic acid and 2-formyl
benzoic acid (Figure2). The phthalic acid decarboxylated to
benzoic acid that further metabolized carbon dioxide and
water.Ni’matuzahroh et al. (2017) studied the degradation of
naphth
alene and phenanthrene by B. subtilis 3KP that degraded
them via the formation of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, salicylic
acid, and pyrocatechol. Sonwani et al. (2019) reported that
B. cereus RKS4

Anthracene is an integral part of many carcinogenic PAHs;
thereforeithasbeendetectedeasilyinseveralcontaminatedsites
of PAHs. Many Bacillihave been identiﬁed and characterized
for degradation of anthracene. Examples are Bacillussp. SBER3
(Bisht et al., 2014), B. cereus JMG-01 ( Das et al., 2017), B.
licheniformis MT
CC 5514 (Swaathy et al., 2014), B. cereus S13
(Bibi
et al., 2018), and B.badiusD1 (Sarwade and Gawai,
2014).D
as et al. (2017) studied the degradation pathway of
anthra
cene for B. cereus JMG-01 that degraded 98% of 500
ppm anthracene. The anthracene degradation was initiated with
the formation of naphthalene and naphthalene-2-methyl. In
the next step, a dioxygenase enzyme catalyzed oxidation of
naphthalene-2-methyl to benzene acetic acid. Further, benzene
acetic acid underwent ring cleavage to produce phthalic acid
and benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde converted to catechol that
degraded via either orthoormetaring cleavage. Swaathy et al.
(2014)reported t
he existence of two degradation pathways
in biosur
factant mediated biodegradation of anthracene by B.
licheniformis (MTCC 5514). One pathway proceeded with the
formation of naphthalene, naphthalene 2-methyl, phthalic acid,
and benzene acetic acid. Another pathway was initiated with
dioxygenation of anthracene to produce di-hydroxy anthracene,
which, further transformed to anthraquinone by a dioxygenase
enzyme (Figure3). Anthraquinone was further degraded with
the formation of phthalic acid, benzaldehyde or benzoic acid,

and catechol. Metabolites of both of the pathways (9, 10-
dihydroxyanthra
cene, anthraquinone, benzene acetic acid, and
catechol) were also reported in the anthracene degradation
pathway of B. cereus S13 that utilized it as the sole source
of carbon and energy (Bibi et al., 2018). Another pathway of
anthra
cene was studied in an alkaliphilic bacterium B. badius
D1 that was able to degrade anthracene at a concentration of 50
mg/100mlatpH9.0(SarwadeandGawai,2014).Inthispathway,

Bacilli-Mediated Degradation of Pyrethroid
Insecticides
Pyrethroid insecticides are synthetic pyrethroids which are
analogs to natural pyrethrins extracted from Chrysanthemum
cinerariaefolium (Cyco ´n and Piotrowska-Seget, 2016).
Represent
ative compounds of these pesticides are cyhalothrin,
fenpropathrin, deltamethrin, cypermethrin, cyﬂuthrin, and
bifenthrin (Zhan et al., 2020). They are used to control a broad
spectrum
of pests in households and agriculture ﬁelds. Due
to their wide range of applications in agriculture ﬁelds, they
have been spread into soil and water and create environmental
problems because of their toxic nature (Zhan et al., 2020).ManyBac
illihave been isolated and characterized for the
degradation of several pyrethroids (Chen et al., 2012b; Cyco ´n
and Piotrowska-Se
get, 2016; Bhatt et al., 2020). In this section,
Bacilli
-mediateddegradationofvariouspyrethroidsisdiscussed.
The degradation of cypermethrin is well-studied in some
Bacilliincluding Bacillussp. SG2 (Pankaj et al., 2016), B. subtilis
BSF01 (
Xiao et al., 2015), B. subtilis strain 1D (Gangola et al.,
2018),B
acillussp. AKD1 (Tiwary and Dubey, 2016), Bacillus
sp. IS
TDS2 (Sundaram et al., 2013) and B. licheniformis B-1
(L
ai et al., 2012). The initial steps of degradation pathways of
cypermethrin
are common in Bacillussp. SG2 and B. subtilis
BSF01 (Xiao et al., 2015; Pankaj et al., 2016). Cypermethrin
was
initially transformed into two metabolites: α-hydroxy-3-
phenoxy-benzene acetonitrile and 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-
dimethyl cyclopropanecarboxylate). The unstable compound,
α-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-benzene acetonitrile was spontaneously
transformed into 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (Figure4). Further
degradationof3-phenoxybenzaldehydeproceededviaadiﬀerent
route in Bacillus sp. SG2 and B. subtilis BSF01. In B.
subtilisBSF01, the degradation of 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde
proceeded via the formation of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid and 3,
5-dimethoxyphenol (Xiao et al., 2015). However, in Bacillus
sp.
SG2, 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde was further converted to
4-propylbenzaldehyde and then to 4-hydroxybenzoate that
was transformed to phenyl ester of o-phenoxy benzoic acid
(Pankaj et al., 2016). The phenyl ester of o-phenoxy benzoic

aliphatic hydrocarbons or short-chain compounds.
Another pathway of degradation of cypermethrin was studiedinB. subtilis strain 1D ( Gangola et al., 2018). In this
pathway,
cypermethrin was initially transformed into 3-(2,
2-dichloro ethenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylate and

(Figure5
).Theunstablecompound,cyclododecylamineoxidized
to phenol which reacted with water to form cyclopentane that
transformed into aliphatic compounds like acetic acid and
decanoic acid. Another metabolite, 3-(2, 2-dichloro ethenyl)-
2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylate was hydrolyzed to form
chloroaceticacid(Gangolaetal.,2018).
The de
gradation pathway of cyhalothrin
[(RS)-α-Cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(Z)-(1RS,3RS)-(2-chloro-3,3,
3-triﬂuoro propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate)]
was studied in B. thuringiensis ZS-19 that initiated
degradation of cyhalothrin by cleavage of the carboxyl ester
linkage through hydrolysis to form α-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-
benzeneacetonitrile and (1RS,3RS)-trans-2,2-dimethyl-(2-
methyl-1-propenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (Chen
et al.,
2015). The α-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-benzeneacetonitrile
was
converted to 3-phenoxybenzote acid via 3-phenoxyphenyl
acetonitrile, N-(2-isoproxy-phenyl)-4-phenoxy-benzamide, and
3-phenoxybenzaldehyde (Figure6). Further degradation of
3-phenoxybenzoate was proceeded through cleavage of diaryl
bondtoproduceandphenolthatwasdegradedviaaromaticring
cleavage( Chenetal.,2015).
The de
gradation pathway of fenpropathrin(α-cyano-3-
phenoxybenzyl 2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylate)
was studied in Bacillus sp. DG-02, isolated from a
soil sample collected from the aerobic pyrethroid-
manufacturing wastewater treatment system of China
(Chen et al., 2014). Initially, fenpropathrin was converted
toα-hydroxy-3-phenoxybenzene
acetonitrile and 2, 2, 3,
3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid phenyl ester
due to cleavage of the carboxyl ester linkage (Figure7).
In the next step, unstable compound α-hydroxy-3-
phenoxybenzeneacetonitrilewasspontaneouslytransformedinto
3-phenoxybenzaldehyde, which oxidized to 3-phenoxybenzoate.
Subsequent degradation of 3-phenoxybenzoate produced 3,
4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 3, 4-dimethoxyphenol, and phenol
(Chenetal.,2014).
Bacilli-Mediated
Degradation of
Organophosphorus Pesticides
Organophosphoruspesticidesarealargegroupofchemicalsthat
widely used for protecting crops, livestock from various pests
(Sidhu G. K. et al., 2019). Commonly used organophosphates
are malat
hion, parathion, methyl parathion, chlorpyrifos,
diazinon, fenitrothion, dichlorvos, ethion, and monocrotophos
(Sidhu G. K. et al., 2019). These compounds act as an
inhibitor of
an acetylcholinesterase enzyme that hydrolyzes
the neurotransmitter acetylcholine found in both the peripheral
and central nervous systems (Robb and Baker, 2020). This

Many reports have been published dealing with the
potential applications of Bacillito degrade organophosphorus
pesticides. Bhadbhade et al. (2002) reported mineralization ofmonocrotophos to
carbon dioxide, ammonia, and phosphates
byB.megaterium MCM B-423, isolated from soil exposed to
monocrotophos. The enzymes, phosphatase, and esterase were
involved in the monocrotophos degradation pathway, which
proceeds via acetic acid, methylamine, and one unidentiﬁed
metabolite. Dash and Osborne (2020) studied degradation
pathways
ofmonocrotophosby B.aryabhattai strainVITNNDJ5
in artiﬁcially contaminated soil and reported that B. aryabhattai
may be degraded monocrotophos via three routes; one route
proceeds with the hydrolysis of monocrotophos into dimethyl
phosphate that was degraded further into phosphoric acid
and acetic acid esters by hydrolase and monooxygenase
enzymes. The second degradation pathway was initiated with
the demethylation of monocrotophos to N-(hydroxymethyl)
acetamide that was further degraded into acetamide. Acetamide
converted into acetic that entered the TCA cycle. In the
third route, monocrotophos, monocrotophos converted
into orthophosphoric acid and acetic acid via formation of
phosphonoacetateintermediate.
Another Bacillussp. TAP-1 that was isolated from sewage
sludge of a wastewater treating system of organophosphorus
pesticide was capable of hydrolyzing high concentrations of
triazophos (50–400 mg/l) (Tang and You, 2012). Salunkhe et al.
(2013)reported t
he biodegradation of an organophosphorus
insecticide
, profenofos by four B. subtilis strains, namely, DR-
39, CS-126, TL-171, and TS-204, isolated from grapevines or
grape rhizosphere and 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol was identiﬁed
as a metabolite. A marine Bacillussp. strain C5 isolated
from the China Bohai Sea produced an extracellular esterase
that hydrolyzed methyl parathion to 4-nitrophenol and other
metabolites (Hao et al., 2014). Anwar et al. (2009) reported that
B. pumilus C2A1
isolated from a soil sample collected from
the cotton ﬁeld, degraded chlorpyrifos, and its ﬁrst hydrolysis
metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol. Strain C2A1 degraded
maximum amounts of chlorpyrifos at alkaline pH (8.5) and
high inoculums bacterial density. Pailan et al. (2015) isolated
org
anophosphates-degrading bacterium, B.aryabhattai strain
SanPS1 from a soil sample of an agricultural ﬁeld located at
Narigram in Burdwan district of West Bengal, India. Strain
SanPS1 degraded parathion via the formation of 4-nitrophenol
and4-nitrocatechol.
Bacilli-Mediated Degradation of
Organochlorine Pesticides
Organochlorine pesticides are a group of chlorinated
compounds, which include DDT, methoxychlor, endosulfan,
dieldrin, chlordane, toxaphene, mirex, kepone, lindane, and
benzene hexachloride ( Jayaraj et al., 2016). These compounds
are widely
distributed to the environment due to applications.
In this section, Bacilli-mediated degradation of organochlorine

Herbicides are chemical substances that are generally used to
control the growth of unwanted plants (Herrera-Herrera et al.,
2016).
These are known as weed killers and divided into two
categorie
s:contactherbicidesandsystematicherbicides.Contact
herbicides are localized in action and aﬀect only the part of the
plant that they touch ( Herrera-Herrera et al., 2016). Examples
are diclofop,
dinoseb, diquat, and paraquat (Herrera-Herrera
et al.,
2016). Systemic herbicides may be translocated to other
partsof
theplants.Examplesareatrazine,quinclorac,glyphosate
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and simazine (Herrera-
Herrera et
al., 2016). In this section, the role of Bacillifor the
degradationofherbicidesisdiscussed.
Bacillus subtilis HB-6 isolated from industrial wastewater
utilized atrazine as its sole nitrogen source for growth and
mineralized it via formation of hydroxyatrazine, cyanuric acid,
and urea (Wang et al., 2014). The atrazine-degrading genes,
trzN, a
tzB, and atzCwhich encode the enzymes to converting
atrazine to cyanuric acid were detected in strain HB-6 (Wang
et al.,
2014).Liu et al. (2014) studied the degradation of
a highly
selective auxin herbicide, quinclorac (3,7-dichloro-8-
quinoline-carboxylic)by B.megaterium Q3isolatedfromtheroot
of tobacco grown in quinclorac contaminated soil. Strain Q3transformed quinclorac to 3, 7-dichloro-8-methyl-quinoline, 3-
chlorin-8-quinoline-carboxylic and 8-quinoline-carboxylic (Liu
etal.,

Bacilli-Mediated Degradation
of Drugs
Ibuprofen and naproxen are known as non-steroidal anti-
inﬂammatory drugs and widely used to control mild to
moderate pain, fever, inﬂammation, menstrual cramps, and
types of arthritis (Marchlewicz et al., 2017). Due to the high
consumption of
these drugs, they have been detected in the
eﬄuents of several biological wastewater treatment systems as
environmental pollutants (Marchlewicz et al., 2017). In this
section,
theBacillus-medited degradation of ibuprofen and
naproxenisdiscussed.
To date, only one species of Bacillus, i.e., B. thuringiensis B1
was able to degrade both Ibuprofen and naproxen (Marchlewicz
et al.,
2017; Górny et al., 2019). The eﬀective degradation of
both
of these drugs occurred in the presence of glucose. B.
thuringiensis B1 was able to degrade ibuprofen and naproxen up
toconcentrationsof25mg/Land12mg/L,respectively.
The degradation pathways of ibuprofen and naproxen
were studied in B. thuringiensis B1. The ﬁrst step of the
ibuprofen degradation is hydroxylation of ibuprofen into 2-
hydroxyibuprofen by aliphatic monooxygenase (Marchlewicz
et al.,
2017). The second step was the conversion of 2-
hydroxyibuprofen to
2-(4-hydroxyphenyl-) propionic acid that
was further transformed into 1,4-hydroquinone by acyl-
CoA synthase/thiolase activity (Figure8). In the next step,

(Marchlewiczetal.,2017).
The de
gradation of naproxen was initiated with the
transformation of naproxen into o-desmethylnaproxen by
the action of tetrahydrofolate dependent O-demethylase
(Górny et al., 2019). The next step involved the
formation of
2-formyl-5-hydroxyphenylacetic that was
converted to salicylic acid (Figure9). Salicyclic acid
hydroxylated to catechol or gentisic acid or can becleaved to 2-oxo-3, 5-heptadienedioic acid (Górny et al.,
2019).
Bacilli-Mediated T

The bacterial remediation of heavy metals involves removals
of heavy metals from aqueous solution and soil through
biosorption,bioaccumulation,orbiotransformation( Dixitetal.,

ManyBacillihave been characterized for the bioreduction
of chromium from Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Examples are Bacillus
sp. strain FM1 (Masood and Malik, 2011), Bacillussp. strain
KS
UCr9a (Ibrahim et al., 2012), B.sphaericus AND 303 (Pal
et al.,
2005),Bacillussp. FY1 (Xiao et al., 2017), Bacillussp.
MNU16(
Upadhyayetal.,2017),B.amyloliquefaciens (D asetal.,

andB.cereusS612( Wangetal.,2015).Severalmechanisms
have
been proposed for chromium reduction and removal.
Chen et al. (2012c) investigated the Cr(VI) uptake mechanism
inB. cereus t
hat reduced Cr(VI) into Cr(III). The reduced
Cr(III) was coordinated with carboxyl and amido functional
groups of the bacterial cell and the Cr(III) precipitates were
accumulated on bacterial surfaces. Das et al. (2014) studied the
mec
hanism of Cr(VI) reduction in B. amyloliquefaciens strain
CSB 9 isolated from chromite mine soil of Sukinda, India. The
reducedproductCr(III)wasremovedviasurfaceimmobilization
and accumulated inside the bacterial cells. Bacillussp. ES 29
produced copper (Cu2+) stimulated soluble Cr(VI)-reducing
enzymethatreducedCr(VI)toCr(III)( Camargoetal.,2003).
The le
ad transformation from toxic Pb(II) to non-toxic lead
compounds has been investigated in a few Bacillusstrains.
Chen et al. (2016) studied the transformation of Pb(II) intonanosized rod-s
haped Ca 2.5Pb7.5(OH)2(PO4)6crystal in B.
cereus 12-2, isolated from lead-zinc mine tailings. Initially,
bacterial cells rapidly absorbed Pb(II) through the synergy of
electrostatic attraction, ionic exchange, and chelating activity
of functional groups present in bacterial cells. In the next
step, enzyme-mediated Pb(II) transformation to rod-shaped
crystalline minerals occurred inside the bacteria. Govarthanan

The selenium reduction from Se(IV) to Se (III) is well-
studied in Bacillusstrains.Mishra et al. (2011) reported the
reduction of
Se(IV) to red-element Se (III) by two strains of
B. megaterium. Garbisu et al. (1995) studied the physiological

concluded that the reduction mechanism involves an inducible
detoxiﬁcation system, which deposited elemental selenium
between the cell wall and the plasma membrane. Another
mechanism was observed in a selenate reducing bacterium,
B. selenatarsenatis SF-1, isolated from selenium-contaminated

sediment (Kashiwa et al., 2001). Strain SF-1 reduced selenate
to selenite
and subsequently to non-toxic insoluble elemental
selenium using lactate as an electron donor and selenate as
an electron acceptor in an anaerobic condition. Elemental
selenium was deposited both inside and outside of the cells. B.
selenitireducens produced enzymes to reduce the oxidized forms
of arsenic and selenium to their less toxic reduced forms (Wells
et al.,
2019).B. cereus CM100B and B .mycoidesstrain SeITE01
produced selenium nanoparticles (SNs) by transformation of
toxic selenite (SeO2−
3) anions into red elemental selenium (Se0)
under aerobic conditions. In this mechanism, initially, SeO2−
3
enzymatically reduced to selenium through redox reactions by
the bacterial enzymes (membrane reductase) and later, selenium
nanoparticles were generated due to the result of an Ostwald
ripeningmechanism(DhanjalandCameotra,2010;Lampisetal.,
2014).
T
he uranium
transformation from U(VI) into nano-
uramphite was studied in two B. thuringiensis strains isolated
from uranium mine ( Pan et al., 2015). The initial step involves
the ad
sorption of U(VI) on the bacterial surface through
coordinatingwithphosphate,-CH 2,andamidegroups.Thenext
step involves the formation and accumulation of needle-like
amorphousuraniumcompounds.
Paraneeiswaran et al. (2015) reported that B. lic heniformis

was further absorbed by strain SPG-2. B. ﬁrmus strain TE7,

Bacilli-Mediated Transformation of Azo
Dyes
Azo dyes are a large group of synthetic aromatic compounds
whichcontainoneormoreazogroups(-N=N-)betweenorganic
residues. Based on the number of azo linkages, azo dyes are
classiﬁed as monoazo, disazo, trisazo, and polyazo ( Benkhaya
et al.,
2020). Few examples of azo dyes are Metanil Yellow, Navy
Blue 2GL,
Dye Orange T4LL, Reactive Red 2, Direct Red-22,
TurquoiseBluedye,andAcidBlack24.Thesearewidelyusedin
the textile industry that is a major source of dye contamination.
Duringthedyeingprocess,thetextileindustrydischarged ∼10%
of the dyes into the wastewater (Easton, 1995). Apart from the
textile
industry, azo dyes are also used in food, paper printing,
color photography, leather, and cosmetic industries (Chang and
Lin, 2001
). They are widely distributed in the environment due
to improper
discharge of dye into wastewater. These dyes are
highly toxic to plants by inhibiting their photosynthesis. In the
environment, they may generate mutagenic and carcinogenic
amines due to microbial transformation ( Chung and Cerniglia,1992;Weisbur
ger, 2002; Asad et al., 2007 ). Dye removal is an
essential
step for the treatment of dye-containing wastewater
(Banat et al., 1996). Microbial dye degradation process has two

ManyBacillus strains have been characterized for
decolorization of wastewater containing various azo dyes.
Anjaneya et al. (2011) studied the decolorization of metanil
yellow using
a sulfonated azo dye decolourizing bacterium,
Bacillussp. AK1 that was isolated from dye contaminated soil
sample collected from Atul Dyeing Industry, Bellary, India.
Bacillussp. AK1 decolorized metanil yellow (200mg L−1)
completely within 27h and transformed it into metanillic acid
andp-aminodiphenylamine by the action of the azoreductase
enzyme. Dawkar et al. (2009) studied the eﬀects of inducers
on t
he decolorization of a textile azo dye, navy blue 2GL by
aBacillussp. VUS isolated from textile eﬄuent contaminated
soil. Strain VUS decolorized azo dye navy blue 2GL within
48h under the static anoxic condition in yeast extract medium,
whereas in the presence of CaCl 2it decolorized it only
within 18h. They reported that CaCl 2induced the activities
of the enzymes involved in the decolorization of navy blue
2GL. 4-Amino-3-(2-bromo-4, 6-dinitro-phenylazo)-phenol
and acetic acid 2-(-acetoxy-ethylamino)-ethyl ester were
detected as the transformation products of dye decolorization.
Bacillus sp. VUS also decolorized dye orange T4LL in
static anoxic condition within 24h and transformed it
into 4-methyl-2-o-tolylazo-benzene-1,3-diamine and [3-
(phenyl-hydrazono)-cyclohexa-1,4-dienyl]-methanol. Another
bacterium, B.licheniformis decoulorized Reactive Red 2 and
transformed it into 2, 4-dichloro-6-[(1H-indazol-5-ylimino)-
methyl]-phenol, benzene sulfonamide, 1H indole and urea
as ﬁnal metabolites (Sudha and Balagurunathan, 2013). B.

Bacilli-Mediated Degradation of Natural
Aromatic Acids
Aromatic acids are a class of chemical compounds in which
an organic acid attached to the aromatic ring. Examples are
phenolic acids (3-Hydroxybenzoic acid. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid
and Salicylic acid) and Hydroxycinnamic acids (cinnamic, 4-
coumaric,andferulicacids).Inthissubsection,theroleof Bacilli
in biodegradation of various aromatic acids is summarized.
B.macerans JJ-lb degraded protocatechuate via ring cleavage
and subsequent enzymatic decarboxylation of the ring ﬁssion
product ( Crawford et al., 1979). Initially, protocatechuate-
2,3-dioxygenase
catalyzes the ring cleavage of protocatechuate
to 5-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde that is further
decarboxylated to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. Mashetty
et al.
(1996)reported the degradation of 3-hydroxybenzoate
by aB
acillussp. that utilized it as the sole source of carbon
and energy. This strain metabolized 3-hydroxybenzoic acid
via protocatechuic acid that was further degraded via both
theortho-andmeta-cleavage pathway. The enzyme activities
for 3-hydroxybenzoate 4-hydroxylase, protocatechuate 3,4-
dioxygenase,andprotocatechuate4,5-dioxygenaseweredetected
in cell-free extracts. Crawford (1976) reported degradation
pathways
of 4-hydroxybenzoate in B. brevisPHB-2,B.circulans
strain 3, and B.laterosporus PHB-7a. B. brevis PHB-2
andB.circulans strain 3 degraded 4-hydroxybenzoate via
protocatechuate that was further degraded through ortho
cleavagepathwayor metacleavagepathway. B.laterosporus PHB-
7a converts 4-hydroxybenzoate to gentisate, which is further
degraded by the glutathione-independent gentisic acid pathway.
Peng et al. (2003) reported the degradation of cinnamic, 4-
coumaric,
and ferulic acids by thermophilic Bacillussp. B-1.
Strain B-1 degraded cinnamic acid via benzoic acid that was
further degraded via catechol and its ring cleavage. The 4-
coumaricaciddegradationproceededvia4-hydroxybenzoicacid
that was further degraded via gentisic acid and its ring cleavage.
The ferculic acid metabolized via 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl-
beta-hydroxypropionic acid, vanillin, and vanillic acid as the
intermediates. Bacillussp. DG-2 degraded 3-phenoxybenzoic
acid via 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy) benzoic acid, protocatechuate,
phenol,and3,4-dihydroxyphenol.Bacilli-Mediated Degradation of Explosives
Bacilliplay a critical role in the degradation of explosives such
as nitrate esters, 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT), Trinitrophenol
(TNP). Denitration is the main step for the biodegradation of
nitrate esters. Meng et al. (1995) studied the biotransformation
ofglycerol
trinitrateby Bacillussp.ATCC51912thatsequentially
denitrated glycerol trinitrate to glycerol via the formation of
glycerol dinitrate and glycerol mononitrate isomers. Similarly,
Bacillussp. ATCC51912 denitrated propylene glycol dinitrate to
propylene glycol via propylene glycol mononitrate (Sun et al.,
1996).Yerson
and Christian (2013) isolated pentaerythritol
tetranitrate (PE
TN)-degrading bacterium, Bacillus sp. J8A2
from mining environment. Strain J8A2 utilized PETN as
its nitrogen source. Bacterial degradation of PENT generally
initiated with sequential denitration of PENT to pentaerythritol
via the intermediary formation of tri-, di-, and mononitrate
pentaerythritol.AnNADPH-dependentPETNreductaseenzyme
isolated from Bacillussp. was capable of liberating nitrite from
nitrateesterswiththeoxidationofNADPH.
Bacillussp. can use TNP as a sole nitrogen source under
aerobic conditions (Singh et al., 2011).TNPs has three electron-
withdrawing
nitro groups that prevent an initial oxidative
attack on the aromatic ring. Therefore, the initial steps of
TNP degradation are reductive. Bacillidegraded TNP by via
hydrogenation to form a Meisenheimercomplex, hydride σ-
complex( Singhetal.,2011).
Degrad
ation of 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) by Bacillussp.
occurs also via the reductive route. B.cereustransformed TNT
to 2,4-dinitrotoluene and 4-aminodinitrotoluene derivates and
degraded 77% of 75mg L−1, TNT within 96h (Mercimek et al.,
2013).Nyanhongo
et al. (2008) reported that Bacillussp. SF
transformedTNTviaaninitialreductionmechanismtoproduce
hydroxylaminodinitrotoluenes, 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluenes, 2-
amino-4,6-dinitrotoluenes, diﬀerent azoxy compounds, 2,6-
diaminonitrotoluenes,and2,4-diaminonitrotoluenes.
PILOT SCALE STUDIES USING BACILLI
For biodegradation purposes, a pilot study plays a vital role
before conducting the big scale degradation studies in ﬁelds.
Chopra and Kumar (2020) examined the degradation of
acetaminophen
(N-acetyl-para-aminophenol) by B. drentensis
strain S1 within the the pilot-scale anaerobic batch reactor.
The ideal conditions include temperature 40◦C, pH 7, 300
mg/L acetaminophen, and agitation speed 165 rpm (Chopra
and Kumar,
2020). 2-Isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanone and
phenothiazine
were identiﬁed metabolites of the acetaminophen
degradation. Sonwani et al. (2019) studied the degradation
of napht
halene in a pilot-scale integrated aerobic treatment
plant and catechol and 2-naphthol were detected as the major
intermediatemetabolites. Fujitaetal.(2002) studiedtheremoval

solubleselenium(selenite/selenate)using Bacillussp.SF-
1 in a continuous ﬂow bioreactor under an anoxic condition.
The outcomes indicated that both selenite and selenate were
reduced to elemental selenium at long cell retention times.

ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR
BIOREMEDIATION OF XENOBIOTIC
COMPOUNDS AND HEAVY METALS USING
BACILLI
This section brieﬂy describes various current technologies used
to enhance the bioremediation of xenobiotic compounds and
heavymetals.
Metagenomics
Several xenobiotic-degrading enzymes stay undiscovered in
light of the fact that a greater part of bacteria (99%) remain
uncluturable in laboratory ( Arora et al., 2010). In such a case,
meta
genomics plays a vital role to investigate novel microbial
enzymes from whole network of microbial community.
The metagenomic approach includes (i) the isolation and
puriﬁcation of DNA from a sample, (ii) cloning of DNA into
appropriate vectors, (iii) the transformation of host cells with
construct and (iv) functional and sequence based screening
of constructed clones (Arora et al., 2010). The sequence-
based
approaches depend on already known sequences of
the target gene and utilize bioinformatics tools. However, the
function-based approaches do not include the involvement of
metagenomic derived sequences and, in this way, may prompt
to the invention of novel genes with desired functions. Several
enzymes involved in biodegradation of various xenobiotic
compounds have been identiﬁed by metagenomic studies of
several environmental samples. Sidhu C. et al. (2019) identiﬁednovel2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl
1,2-dioxygenase (BphC-SD3) and
catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O-RW1) from the metagenomic
DNA isolated from sludge and river water samples. These
enzymes were clones, expressed and puriﬁed to monitor their
abilities to degrade various aromatic compounds. BphC-SD3
speciﬁcally oxidized 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, catechol, and
3-methylcatechol, whereas C23O-RW1 oxidized catechol,
4-chlorocatechol, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl and 3-methylcatechol.
Suenaga et al. (2007) studied extradiol dioxygenases diversity
ina
ctivated sludge used to treat coke plant wastewater by
a metagenomic approach and identiﬁed 38 new extradiol
dioxygenases that formed a new subfamily of extradiol
dioxygenases. Singh et al. (2010) identiﬁed two ﬂavin
monooxygenase
s from an eﬄuent treatment plant sludge
metagenomic library which were involved in the oxidation
of indole to a mixture of indigo and indirubin pigments.
Nagayamaetal.(2015) identiﬁedamulticomponenthydroxylase
involved in
the phenol degradation from a metagenomic library
derivedfrom soilsampleartiﬁciallycontaminatedwith aromatic
compounds. Choi et al. (2018) identiﬁed and characterized
the ﬁr
st metagenome-derived toxoﬂavin-degrading enzyme
that was involved in biodegradation of toxoﬂavin and its
derivatives including methyltoxoﬂavin, fervenulin, and
reumycin. Ye et al. (2010) identiﬁed a muti-copper oxidase
with
laccase activity from activity-based functional screening of
a metagenomic library from mangrove soil. The characteristic
feature of this laccase was its strong alkaline activity and its
highsolubility.
Rational Designing
This protein engineering approach requires the knowledge of
protein structure, function and mechanism to improve enzyme
properties. Several xenobiotic-degrading enzymes of Bacilli
have been improved using rational designing approach. Best
studied example is laccase enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation
of a variety of xenobiotic compounds, including diphenols,
polyphenols, diamines, aromatic amines, and synthetic dyes.
Mollania et al. (2011) used rational design approach to increase
thet
hermalstabilityoflaccaseenzymeof Bacillussp.HR03.They
substituted Glu188 residue with 2 positive (Lys and Arg) and
one hydrophobic (Ala) residues to obtain mutants. All variants
exhibited strong thermal stability and thermal activation as
compared to the wild-type. The 3-fold higher thermal activation
and higher T50(5◦C) as compared to native enzyme was
observed in the case of the Glu188Lys variant ( Mollania et al.,
2011).R
asekh et al. (2014) increased the tolerance of this
lac
case toward organic solvents by substitution of the Glu188
residue with non-polar (Ala, Ile, Leu, and Val) and positively
charged (Lys and Arg) residues. All variants showed higher
C50values (organic solvent concentration at which 50% of
enzyme activity remains) as compared to the wild type. Non-
polar amino acid substitutions created more eﬃcient mutants as
they exhibited signiﬁcantly increased C 50value and decreased
thermo inactivation rate in the presence of organic solvents
(Rasekhetal.,2014).
Another
example of rational design to improve the enzyme
activity is cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Bacillus

27Arora Bacilli-Mediated Degradation
megaterium 3 (P450 BM3). C armichael and Wong (2001)
reported double mutation in P450 BM3 at R47L and Y51F
to enh
ance its oxidation activity toward phenanthrene and
ﬂuoranthene. The mutants showed 40-folds and 10-folds
oxidation activity toward phenanthrene and ﬂuoranthene. Li
et al.
(2001)reported oxidation of polycyclic hydrocarbons
such
as naphthalene, ﬂuorene, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene,
and 9-methylanthracene by triple mutant of P450 BM3 at
A74G/F87V/L188Qsites.
Directed Evolution
Directed evolution is an approach of protein engineering to
improve the eﬃciency of proteins without a prior knowledge
of amino acid sequences. It is based on the Darwinian
principle of evolution and involves (i) the use of rapid
molecular manipulations to mutate the target gene and
(ii) the subsequent selection of the improved variants by
screening (Arora et al., 2010). Using directed evolution,
many xenobiotic-de
grading genes have been improved for
their properties. Best studied example is cytochrome P450
monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium 3 (P450 BM3) that
involves in oxidation of various aromatic compounds. Sideri
et al.
(2013)used directed evolution to generate mutants of
P450 BM3
to hydoxylate chrysene and pyrene. Two rounds
of random mutagenesis by error–prone PCR were used to
generate mutants. Three mutants exhibited hydroxylation of
chrysene and pyrene. These mutants hydroxylated chrysene in
diﬀerent positions and hydroxylate pyrene to 1-hydroxypyrene.
Santos et al. (2019) reported that directed evolution of
P450 BM3
to improve the hydroxylation activity toward
six o-heterocycles; benzo-1,4-dioxane, phthalan, isochroman,
2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, benzofuran, and dibenzofuran. They
screened in-house libraries of P450 BM3 to generate P450 BM3
CM1 (R255P/P329H) that was further underwent error–prone
PCR,generatingP450BM3GS2(R255S/P329H/F331L).Another
error-prone PCR of P450 BM3 GS-2 generated P450 BM3 GS3
(I122V/R255S/P329H/F331L). In next step, P450 BM3 WT was
subjected to single site saturation mutagenesis (SSM) in the
four identiﬁed positions and double SSM at positions I122 and
R255,whichprovidedthemostactivevariants,P450BM3R255G
andR255L.

Genetic engineering or recombinant DNA technology includes
multiple techniques used to cut up and join together DNA
from various biological sources, and to introduce the
resulting hybrid DNA into an organism so as to create new
combinations of heritable genetic material (Rosenberg, 2017).
Genetic engineering
is a promising technique to enhance
the potentials of microorganisms for the bioremediation of
environmentalpollutants(EzezikaandSinger,2010).Genetically
engineered b
acteria are considered as potential candidates
for bioremediation applications in soil, groundwater, and
activatedsludge( SaylerandRipp,2000).Alistoffewgeneticallyengineered b
acteria with their bioremediation applications is
presentedin Table2.
Even though several genetically engineered Bacillihave been
constructed for various industrial applications (Wang et al.,
2006;Dre
jer et al., 2020 ), the bioremediation applications of
genetically
engineered Bacilliis very limited. Huang et al. (2015)
constructed a genetically engineered B. sub tilis168 expressing
the arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase gene of
thermophilicalgaeforbioremediationofarsenic.Thisgenetically
engineered bacterium was able to convert the inorganic As into
dimethylarsenateandtrimethylarsineoxideviamethylation,and
also able to volatilize substantial amounts of dimethylarsine and
trimethylarsine (Huang et al., 2015). The rate of As methylation
and volatilization
increased with temperature from 37 to 50◦
C. However, wild type B. subtilis 168 lacks the properties of
methylationandvolatilization.
Genome-Editing Technologies
Genome-editing technologies are currently using to manipulate
DNA by the engineered nucleases or molecular scissors, which
have a wide range of applications in research ﬁelds of plants,
animals, and microorganisms ( Jaiswal et al., 2019). The process
ofgenome
editingisgenerallyperformedbygenomeeditingtools
andinvolvesfollowingsteps(i)doublestandardbreakintargeted
genesequence(ii)repairedbyhomologousrecombinationusing
self-designed guide sequence complementary to targeted gene
sequence (iii) error-prone non-homologous end joining (Jaiswal
et al.,
2019). The aim of using gene-editing tools is to develop
a microbe wit
h great potentials. Jaiswal et al. (2019) describe the
roleof
thegene-editingtoolssuchasTranscription-activatorslike
eﬀectornucleases(TALEN),clusteredregularlyinterspacedshort
palindromic repeats (CRISPR-Cas), and zinc ﬁnger nucleases
(ZFNs) to design bacteria with improved metabolic capabilities
forenhancingthebioremediationofenvironmentalpollutants.
Genomics
Genomic studies are a powerful tool for the study of
microorganisms capable of degrading environmental pollutants
(Rodríguezetal.,2020).Next-Generationsequencingtechnology
has
been widely used for the whole-genome sequences of
various organisms. The whole genomes of several xenobiotic-
degrading Bacillihave been sequenced using Next-Generation
sequencing technology, and several genes and proteins involved
in biodegradation havebeen identiﬁedthrough gene predictions
and annotation of the Bacilligenomes. Hossain et al. (2020)
identiﬁed chromate transporters in the genome of a chromium-
reducing b
acterium, B. cereus TN10 isolated from tannery
eﬄuent. Chromate transporters are involved in chromium
resistance and play a role in the eﬄux of cytoplasmic chromate.
He et al. (2010) identiﬁed a putative chromate transport
operon, two
chromate transporters, azoreductase gene, and four
nitroreductasegenesin Bacilluscereus SJ1whichmaybeinvolved
chromate resistance and chromate reduction. The genome
ofB. cereus S612 contains genes encoding multidrug eﬄux
pumps and reductases that are potentially related to chromium
resistance and reduction ( Wang et al., 2015). Genome analysis

Bioinformatics T
ools
Bioinformatics approaches including biodegradative databases,
pathway prediction systems, and protein-structure predicting
tools may be used for biodegradation studies (Arora and Bae,
2014). Biode
gradative databases provide information about
pollutants,
their degradation pathways, bacteria, genes, and
enzymes in their degradation (Arora and Bae, 2014). Examples
of t
hese databases are the EAWAG Biocatalysis/Biodegradation
Database (EAWAG-BBD), a database of biodegradative
oxygenases (OxDBase), Biodegradation Network-Molecular
Biology database (Bionemo), MetaCyc, and BioCyc (Arora and
Bae,2014

RecognitION(ORION)
(Ghouzametal.,2015).CONCLUSION
ManyB
acillihave been isolated and characterized for
degradation of various environmental pollutants including
chloronitrophenols, dyes, drugs, pesticide, explosives, polycyclic
aromatic compounds, heterocyclic aromatic compounds, and
heavy metals. The biochemical characterization of degradation
pathways of various environmental pollutants was extensively
studied in Bacilli.The genes involved in the degradation of
various xenobiotic compounds have been identiﬁed from the
genome sequences of various xenobiotic degrading Bacilli.
Further studies on cloning and expression of these genes would
be useful to understand the mechanism of biodegradation. The
construction of genetically engineered Bacilliwith improved
degradation eﬃciency will be useful for biodegradation
applications. Furthermore, genome editing tools may be used
to develop more eﬃcient Bacillifor the bioremediation of
pollutants. Bioinformatics tools such as databases, pathway
prediction systems, and protein structure predicting tools are
useful to determine the fate of environmental pollutants in
theﬁelds.

Globally, plastic-based pollution is now recognized as one of the serious threats to
the environment. Among different plastics, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) occupies
a pivotal place, its excess presence as a waste is a major environmental concern.
Mechanical, thermal, and chemical-based treatments are generally used to manage
PET pollution. However, these methods are usually expensive or generate secondary
pollutants. Hence, there is a need for a cost-effective and environment-friendly method
for efﬁcient management of PET-based plastic wastes. Considering this, enzymatic
treatment or recycling is one of the important methods to curb PET pollution. In this
regard, PET hydrolases have been explored for the treatment of PET wastes. These
enzymes act on PET and end its breakdown into monomeric units and subsequently
results in loss of weight. However, various factors, speciﬁcally PET crystallinity,
temperature, and pH, are known to affect this enzymatic process. For effective
hydrolysis of PET, high temperature is required, which facilitates easy accessibility
of substrate (PET) to enzymes. However, to function at this high temperature, there
is a requirement of thermostable enzymes. The thermostability could be enhanced
using glycosylation, immobilization, and enzyme engineering. Furthermore, the use of
surfactants, additives such as Ca2C, Mg2C, and hydrophobins (cysteine-rich proteins),
has also been reported to enhance the enzymatic PET hydrolysis through facilitating
easy accessibility of PET polymers. The present review encompasses a brief overview of
the use of enzymes toward the management of PET wastes. Various methods affecting
the treatment process and different constraints arising thereof are also systematically
highlighted in the review.

INTRODUCTION
Indiscriminate usage of plastics and related products along with its poor disposal management leads
to the widespread presence of plastic waste in the environment. The need for plastic becomes so
much prevalent that it is now described as one of the inseparable commodities (Koshti et al., 2018).
Various properties such as light weight, heat resistance, high malleability, transparency, hardness,

Maurya et al. Enzymatic Remediation of PET Plastics
and tensile strength make plastics as one of the desirable polymers
for a variety of applications. This extensive application of plastic
resulted in the steady rise of plastic waste in diﬀerent ecosystems.
Plastic is highly recalcitrant and takes about 1,000 years to
decompose in nature, and thus, it keeps on accumulating in
nature (Webb et al., 2013). This excess accumulation of plastic
and associated wastes in the environment possesses various risks
to living beings (Ogunola et al., 2018; Saleem et al., 2018).
From the start of the 21st century, the production of plastic
has increased tremendously because of high demand, and as a
consequence of it, plastic waste generation also tripled in these
two decades (Beat Plastic Pollution, 2020). At present, around
0.3 billion of plastic wastes are produced, and 90% of it lands
up in the ocean (Schmidt et al., 2017). Since the 1950s, around
8,300 million plastic wastes has been generated, and by 2050,
it is expected to reach double-digit billions, if plastic waste is
generated at the same pace (Geyer et al., 2017).
Plastics have resistance toward organic solvents, oxidation,
and ionizing radiation, making it a priority choice for many
industrial applications. From the total plastic production, 33%
are used in packaging (Rhodes, 2018). Among various forms
of plastics, polyethylene terephthalate (PET)–based plastics are
noteworthy as they are widely used in packaging industries
because of their durability and thermostability. PET is a
semicrystalline, colorless, hygroscopic resin with excellent
properties of high wear and tear resistance, high tensile strength,
and transparency (Koshti et al., 2018). Owing to these properties,
PET is extensively used in packaging industries. Prominently, it is
used in plastic bottles of soft drinks, food jars, and plastics ﬁlms.
Polyethylene terephthalate is synthesized by polycondensation
of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) or
transesteriﬁcation of dimethyl terephthalate and EG forming a
polymer of semiaromatic polyesters (Hiraga et al., 2019). TPA
and EG monomeric units of PET are linked by ester linkages.
It is chemically inert and hydrophobic in character, which
creates an almost non-soakable surface (de Castro et al., 2017).
Melting temperature (T m) of PET is noted to be 240–250C with
good hydrolytic stability (Mohsin et al., 2017). PET varies in
crystallinity (CrI); for instance, those possessing up to 7% CrI are
called low crystalline PET (lcPET) and with 30–35% CrI is high-
crystalline PET (hcPET) (Furukawa et al., 2019). The extent of
CrI depicts the mobility of ester linkages in PET (Zekriardehani
et al., 2017). High CrI indicates more rigidity in the linkages.
The glass transition temperature (T g) of PET is around 70–80C
(Ronkvist et al., 2009). Tgis the temperature at which mobility of
the polymer is increased, allowing more accessibility to ester links
between monomeric units.
The high demand for PET-based plastics, especially in
packaging industries, leads to the total production of 18.8 million
tons in 2015 out of total of 269 million tons of total plastic
production (Taniguchi et al., 2019). Out of total PET production,
only 28.4% is recycled to ﬁber, sheets, ﬁlms, and bottles, and the
rest is discarded in the environment (Taniguchi et al., 2019). This
discarded PET then goes into the open environment and forms a
threat to the various life forms.
Like other plastics, PET is usually non-biodegradable and
diﬃcult to decompose, especially those with high crystallinity.Hence, most of the PET-based plastic wastes are either
incinerated or dumped in landﬁll sites (Geyer et al., 2017).
A very low portion of it is recycled. As mentioned above,
accumulation of plastic wastes aﬀects the normal functioning of
an ecosystem through various detrimental eﬀects on living forms.
Consumption of plastic materials by stray animals and tiny plastic
materials ﬂoating on water bodies by aquatic animals lead to
various alterations in their physiological activities (Bhattacharya
and Khare, 2020). Sometimes, this consumption also leads to
blockage of the digestive system and clogging of respiratory
passage and ultimately results in the mortality of particular
animal species (Koshti et al., 2018). In addition to that, the
toxic constituents released during the partial decomposition of
plastic wastes also add on to soil pollution and aﬀect various
life forms. As PET-based plastics are hydrophobic in nature
and thus act as adsorption sites for various pollutants such
as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals found in
aquatic and terrestrial systems (Bhattacharya and Khare, 2020).
These adhered toxins are also transferred through the food
chain and possess a risk for high-trophic-level consumers, as
these may get biomagniﬁed upon transfer through food chains
(Koshti et al., 2018).
At present, majorly employed plastic/PET disposal methods in
developing countries are landﬁlling and incineration. Landﬁlling
cannot be carried out for long because of scarcity of space and
increasing cost; similarly, incineration results in an emission
of toxic fumes containing various toxicants and ﬂy ash, which
requires further disposal (Saleem et al., 2018). However, recycling
is considered one of the best ways to manage plastic/PET
wastes. Recycling uses less energy and fewer resources and
also leads to the lowering of carbon footprint compared to
the production of petrochemical-based virgin PET products
(Quartinello et al., 2017). Post consumption, PET wastes in
many countries (most of the European countries and Japan) are
recycled to form new products through the recovery of PET
monomers (TPA and EG). Various recycling options viz.thermal
(used as fuels), material/mechanical (melted and reused once),
and chemical/catalytic (degraded to monomers and used for re-
synthesis) are usually practiced for management of PET wastes
(Kawai et al., 2019).
Material or mechanical recycling is one of the widely used
methods for recycling of PET wastes. This process involves
sorting and separation of wastes followed by washing for the
removal of dirt and contaminants from wastes (Park and Kim,
2014). Thereafter grinding and crushing are accomplished to
reduce the particle size; ﬁnally, reextrusion and reprocessing
are done for the production of new products (Park and
Kim, 2014). However, heterogeneity of waste along with the
presence of contaminants mainly hinders mechanical processing.
Additionally, products formed from mechanically recycled PET
wastes are of poor quality because of mechanical stress and
photo-oxidation caused by the heat of fusion (Park and Kim,
2014; Kawai et al., 2019). Hence, this method of recycling is
generally practiced for the production of low-grade plastics.
Similarly, thermal processing/incineration of PET waste is
considered to be undesirable as it results in air pollution through
the generation of toxic fumes.

Maurya et al. Enzymatic Remediation of PET Plastics
Chemical-based recycling involves the degradation of PET
into its monomeric, oligomeric, and other chemical forms using
various processes involving diﬀerent harsh chemicals (Park and
Kim, 2014). Glycol-based glycolysis, hydrolysis using strong acids
and alkali, and aminolysis using primary amines are some of
the chemical-based recycling methods (Joo et al., 2018). These
methods are not environment-friendly and cost-eﬀective and
thus are normally not suggested for the recycling of PET wastes.
In the midst of the aforementioned recycling methods,
biocatalytic-based recycling of PET is identiﬁed as one of the
eﬃcient and eco-friendly strategies for the management of
PET wastes. Biocatalytic recycling not only sustainably manages
the PET wastes, but also the products formed through this
process possess the same properties as the virgin PET. PET
hydrolases are identiﬁed to play a pivotal role in catalytic-based
recycling of PET wastes. However, considering the total PET
production, still the total recycling or recovery rate is very
low, and most of these wastes enter into landﬁlls and open
aquatic environment. Catalytic-based recycling of PET waste is
successfully implemented in many countries (France, Japan) and
identiﬁed as one of the contributing factors in the concept of
a circular PET economy (Tournier et al., 2020). Nevertheless,
eﬃcient PET hydrolases are very limited in number, and still,
only four PET hydrolases (cutinases) have been identiﬁed that
can signiﬁcantly degrade PET to its monomers (Kawai et al.,
2020). However, other specialized enzymes, viz. lipase, esterase,
and PETase, have been used by several researchers for the
hydrolysis of PET into monomeric forms viz. TPA, EG, mono-
2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET), and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET) (Wang et al., 2008; Ribitsch et al., 2011;
Ma et al., 2012; Bollinger et al., 2020). Figure 1 represents a
schematic diagram showing various recycling methods for PET
with associated processes and their outcomes.
In this review, a brief overview of enzymatic recycling
of PET wastes and diﬀerent methods used to enhance the
recycling performance are discussed. Various factors aﬀecting
the hydrolysis rate and constraints arising during the hydrolysis
process are also highlighted in the review.
BIOLOGICAL APPROACH FOR
MANAGEMENT OF PET WASTES
The high recalcitrant nature of plastic waste including PET waste
is a major bottleneck; however, biological recycling involving
enzymatic-hydrolysis of plastic may be used to tackle the menace
of plastic/PET pollution in an eco-friendly and eﬃcient way. As
mentioned above, PET is linked by ester bonds, which can be
hydrolyzed by various hydrolytic enzymes into its monomers
TPA, EG, MHET, and BHET (Ronkvist et al., 2009; Ribitsch
et al., 2011). Figure 2 shows the enzymatic hydrolysis of
PET. But ester linkages of PET usually have low accessibility
and thus become diﬃcult for depolymerization (Austin et al.,
2018). However, enzymes possessing esterase/hydrolytic activity
have been used widely for the hydrolysis of PET. Table 1
shows the list of various enzymes (PET hydrolases) reported
to hydrolyze PET.Although various enzymes are reported to degrade PET
naturally, the extent of degradation is found to be quite low.
Some esterases, for example, PETase (Austin et al., 2018), cutinase
(Sulaiman et al., 2012), and lipase (Macedo and Pio, 2005),
have been used to hydrolyze BHET to yield MHET. MHET can
further enzymatically degrade using MHETase into TPA and
EG (Koshti et al., 2018). Factors such as the crystallinity of
PET, hydrophobicity, and structure usually limit enzyme function
(Koshti et al., 2018). These and other factors are discussed
later in the review.
Interest in PET hydrolases gains momentum with the work
of Yoshida et al. (2016). Yoshida and coworkers reported a
novel bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 capable of using
low-crystallinity (1.9%) PET ﬁlm as a major carbon and energy
source. I. sakaiensis, when grown on the PET, secretes PET-
hydrolyzing enzymes (PETase, MHETase), which synergistically
hydrolyze PET polymers into monomeric forms. PETase is
a key enzyme for PET degradation, and cutinase has shown
maximum similarity with PETase (Liu et al., 2018). But PETase
has a broader active site compared to cutinase, making high
accommodative region for PET (Chen et al., 2018). As cutinases
are found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, it is widely available
for biodegradation. In this review, cutinase is covered to a
larger extent because of its wide coverage in literature toward
PET degradation.
Enzymes Used for PET Hydrolysis
Cutinase
Cutinase (E.C. 3.1.1.74) is majorly produced by either
saprophytic microorganism, which utilizes cutin as a carbon
source or by phytopathogenic microorganisms for breaking the
cutin barrier to enter into the host plants. Cutinase is a serine
esterase that has the catalytic triad consisting of Ser–His–Asp
residues (Egmond and de Vlieg, 2000). It belongs to the a/b
hydrolase superfamily (Egmond and de Vlieg, 2000). The
active site of cutinase can accommodate high-molecular-weight
compounds such as cutin and other related synthetic compounds.
Hydrolysis of synthetic polymers such as PET (Dimarogona
et al., 2015), polycaprolactone (Ad ıgüzel and Tunçer, 2017),
polystyrene (PS) (Ho et al., 2018), polyethylene furanoate
(Weinberger et al., 2017), and polybutylene succinate (Hu et al.,
2016) have also been reported using cutinase. Cutinase-mediated
hydrolysis of polylactic acid is also demonstrated by several
authors (Masaki et al., 2005; Kitadokoro et al., 2019).
Cutinase is widely reported from fungal and bacterial species.
Table 2 enlists some of these cutinases with their respective
PET hydrolysis rates. The catalytic eﬃciency of cutinase has
been observed maximum with p-nitrophenyl butyrate and
p-nitrophenyl acetate (Herrero Acero et al., 2011; Y ang et al.,
2013), and thus, it has more aﬃnity for the substrate with less
carbon chain length compared to other substrates.
Owing to the versatility of hydrolyzing a broad range of
ester bonds and to catalyze esteriﬁcation and transesteriﬁcation
reactions, cutinase is viewed as a promising enzyme for various
industrial applications. For instance, it is widely used in the
ﬁeld of oil and dairy products, ﬂavor compounds, and phenolic

compounds production (Dutta et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013).
It is also reported in insecticide and pesticide degradation
(Dutta et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013). As an enzyme, it has
not only been studied for the degradation of polyesters but
has also been used in ﬁber modiﬁcation (Alisch et al., 2004).
Cutinase possesses valuable properties particularly required for
PET degradation, and thus, it has caught the eye of many
researchers in recent years. It is a well-studied substitute
for harsh chemicals usually practiced during chemical-based
hydrolysis/recycling of plastics (Macedo and Pio, 2005; Tournier
et al., 2020). Cutinases are also known to synthesize polyesters
under non-aqueous media using polycondensation reaction with
various diacids and alcohols. In this aspect, cutinase from
Humicola insolens (HiC) immobilized on Lewatit beads was used
by Hunsen et al. (2007) for the synthesis of polyester through
the condensation reaction. Similarly, Pellis et al. (2016) used
cutinase 1 from Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica for polycondensation
of dimethyl adipate with various polyols for the synthesis of
high-molecular-weight polyesters.
Lipase
Lipase has also been used by several researchers for the hydrolysis
of PET. Eﬀective degradation of PET nanoparticles usinglipase from Candida cylindracea and Pseudomonas sp. has been
reported by Ma et al. (2012). Similarly, Wang et al. (2008) employ
BHET/TPA-induced lipase from Aspergillus oryzae for hydrolysis
of PET. Moreover, Carniel et al. (2017) and de Castro et al.
(2017) used the combination of lipase from Candida antarctica
(C. antarctica lipase lB CALB) and HiC for eﬃcient PET
hydrolysis to TPA. Although HiC showed better performance
with PET hydrolysis, the enzyme has limited competence to
convert MHET (one of the intermediates of PET hydrolysis)
into TPA. On the other hand, CALB can easily convert MHET
into TPA but has lower eﬃciency toward initial PET hydrolysis
when used singly. However, the combination of both enzymes
synergistically improves the overall PET hydrolysis. However,
complete studies on the eﬀect of enzyme dosages, temperature,
and pH are lacking. Lipase and cutinase have a common feature
of surface hydrophobicity (de Castro et al., 2017). Unlike other
lipases, lipase B has a superﬁcial catalytic site; hence, in the
absence of the hydrophobic interface, it is still accessible to the
substrate (Stauch et al., 2015).
Esterase
Monomers of PET are linked by ester linkage, and these can
be cleaved using esterase found in almost all living organisms

(Koshti et al., 2018). Ribitsch et al. (2011) used Bacillus subtilis
nitrobenzylesterase (BsEstB) and applied it to hydrolyze PET
into TPA and MHET [mono(2-hydroxyethyl)] TPA. Kawai
et al. (2014) made use of recombinant thermostabilized
polyesterase from Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190
capable of hydrolyzing PET and the PET-hydrolyzing
activity was observed to increase in presence of Ca ions.
Recombinant esterase from Thermobiﬁda halotolerans
(Thh_Est) was reported by Ribitsch et al. (2012) to degrade
PET into TA and MHET.PETase
PETase (3.1.1.101) was discovered from the bacterium
I. sakaiensis 201-F6 by Yoshida et al. (2016). PETase
and cutinases share high sequence identity, indicating the
existence of critical structural features responsible for substrate
binding (Fecker et al., 2018; Kawai et al., 2019). Even small
diﬀerences between these enzymes are crucial and deﬁne
their speciﬁc activities (Chen et al., 2018). High-resolution
crystal structure study of PETase highlights the active site,
which seems to be wider than the other cutinases, and

thus this could be a factor of the high speciﬁcity of the
enzyme toward heavy substrate PET (Chen et al., 2018;
Kawai et al., 2020).
Overall, PET hydrolases (PET-hydrolyzing enzymes) are
generally limited to cutinases; structurally, they are homologous
to lipase, but lack a lid covering the active site (Kawai et al.,
2019). This shallow open active site with hydrophobic amino
acid residues aids in PET binding and hydrolysis (Kawai et al.,
2020). The lid is present in the active site of lipase and is known
for interfacial activation in lipases. Lipases are not much active
in PET hydrolysis, but like esterases and cutinases, they are
known for surface modiﬁcation of PET ﬁbers. Esterase activity
is limited to short-chain acyl esters and thus is also not muchreported to hydrolyze hydrophobic PET. Comparative X-ray
crystallography data of actinomycetes cutinases and PETase
(from I. sakaiensis) showed the presence of a broader active
site and extra disulﬁde bond in the latter (Kawai et al., 2020).
Also, the active form of cutinases is in the form of a Ca2C-
bound state. There is no Ca2C-binding site in the case of PETase.
Moreover, serine residue in the catalytic triad of actinomycetes
cutinases is replaced with alanine in PETase (Kawai et al.,
2020). However, compared to actinomycetes cutinases, PETase
is heat liable and act only on lcPET. Considering this, presently
researchers are trying to increase the thermostability of PETase
and its catalytic eﬃciency using various protein engineering
techniques (Kawai et al., 2020).
The textile or clothing industry is also one of the major
producers of PET waste, as it uses polyester as a major raw
material. However, the heterogeneous nature of textile waste
creates a major hurdle in recycling, as it comprised diﬀerent
types of natural or synthetic plastic wastes. Chemical and
mechanical recycling, though, is practiced, but segregation
is the ﬁrst and utmost important step in the recycling of
textile wastes. Biocatalytic recycling of textile waste though
has potential, but there are limited reports on this aspect. As
enzymes are highly speciﬁc and thus may target the suitable
substrate (PET) in a heterogeneous kind of waste, in this
regard, sequential chemical treatment under neutral condition
followed by enzymatic treatment for eﬃcient hydrolysis of
polyester composed textile waste is reported by Quartinello et al.
(2017). Chemical treatment under neutral condition resulted in
the production of 85% TA and small oligomers (Quartinello
et al., 2017). The oligomers were further hydrolyzed using
enzymatic treatment utilizing HiC, yielding 97% of pure TA,
available for further recycling. The mixture of PET hydrolases
(as mentioned above) could also be used for the biocatalytic
conversion of textile polymers into monomers for further
recycling. Moreover, compared to other cutinases, actinomycetes
cutinases are known to have broad substrate speciﬁcity and thus
could be used for hydrolysis of a range of polyesters ﬁbers
(Kawai et al., 2019).

IMPORTANT FACTORS AFFECTING
ENZYMATIC PET HYDROLYSIS
Factors such as crystallinity of PET, temperature, pH of
the hydrolysis reactions, buﬀer strength, and nature of
substituent/additives present in plastics (as plasticizers) are
some of the factors aﬀecting the enzymatic degradation of PET.
These factors can aﬀect the enzymatic PET hydrolysis either by
altering the enzyme activity or by inhibiting the accessibility to
the ester linkage of the PET.
Crystallinity(CrI) of PET
Low-CrI PET (lcPET) is easily degradable compared to those
with high CrI. High-CrI PET shows high tensile strength and
more compactness, and thus, it is diﬃcult for the enzyme to
access the ester linkage. Hence, the degradation is hampered.
The diﬀerent enzyme also shows speciﬁcity toward particular
CrI, for instance, Pseudomonas mendocina cutinase (PmC)
showed high aﬃnity toward lcPET of 7% CrI compared to
Fusarium solani cutinase (FsC) (Ronkvist et al., 2009). Cutinase
isolated from T. cellulosilytica hydrolyzes high-CrI PET at a
slower rate compared with lcPET (Herrero Acero et al., 2011).
Aliphatic polyesters have low CrI and low Tgin comparison to
semiaromatic polyesters like PET; hence, the latter has limited
access to ester linkage (Austin et al., 2018).
Temperature
Usually high temperature results in better degradation of PET,
as it creates ﬂexibility and easy accessibility to ester bonds.
Moreover, if the enzyme remains stable up to the Tgof PET
(70–80C), and then hydrolysis will further be increased. Thus,
there is a need for thermostable enzyme, which can optimally
work at high temperature or Tgof PET (70C). Ronkvist et al.
(2009) used Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC) to degrade lcPET
and observed complete degradation within 94 h of treatment at
70C, whereas PmC and FsC could only degrade 5% of PET
at 50 and 40C, respectively. Both the enzymes were found to
be ineﬀective with respect to PET degradation at 70C. Müller
et al. (2005) observed only 50% loss in weight of PET at 55C
within 3 weeks of enzymatic treatment using a high concentration
of cutinase from Thermobiﬁda fusca (TfC). On the other hand,
97% PET degradation at 80C within 96 h was detected using
HiC with lesser enzyme content (0.13 mg mL 1) (Ronkvist
et al., 2009), indicating superiority of HiC over TfC considering
PET hydrolysis. Indeed, HiC can degrade close to Tgof PET,
indicating a better option for PET degradation.
pH
Cutinase from most of the organisms are highly active at alkaline
pH. However, during continuous enzymatic PET hydrolysis,
the media become acidic due to the formation of monomer
TPA. This acidic condition aﬀects the enzymatic hydrolysis rate
(Ronkvist et al., 2009). Thus, for eﬀective PET hydrolysis, besides
thermostability, a broad range of pH stability (toward both
alkaline and acidic range) of the enzyme is also one of the
prerequisites. Unlike other cutinases, the enzyme from Thielavia
terrestris was observed to be active at acidic pH in addition to hightemperature tolerance, and thus, it is used by Y ang et al. (2013) for
eﬀective PET degradation.
As TPA-induced acidiﬁcation of the reaction media is
known to inhibit enzymatic activity, increase in buﬀer
strength/concentration lowers this enzyme inhibition (Gamerith
et al., 2017a; Furukawa et al., 2019). According to Schmidt et al.
(2016), ionic strength and choice of buﬀer (Tris–HCl, phosphate,
MOPS, HEPES) thus aﬀect the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET.
Thus, along with pH, the ionic strength of the buﬀer also aﬀects
the PET hydrolysis rate.
Speciﬁcity of the Enzyme
Mostly PET is characterized by an amorphous fraction,
which is easily accessed by the enzyme and catalytically
converted into oligomers or monomers, whereas the crystalline
fraction is more rigid and has limited access by the enzyme.
Thus, hcPET has lower degradation rates with hydrolases.
Generally, PET hydrolases catalyze endo-type hydrolysis activity
by cleaving internal ester bonds of PET, resulting in the
formation of oligomers (Kawai et al., 2019). However, Wei
et al. (2019) using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
detected both endo- and exo-type hydrolysis activity toward
the amorphous region of PET (food-packing container) using
recombinant PET hydrolase (thermophilic TfCut2 from T. fusca)
expressed in B. subtilis. With the combination of endo and
exo activity, an amorphous region is rapidly hydrolyzed by
the recombinant enzyme, resulting in >50% weight loss
after 96 h of enzymatic treatment at 70C. The remaining
crystalline structure is hydrolyzed slowly with only endo-
chain scission activity, resulting in no detectable weight loss
(Wei et al., 2019).
METHODS TO ENHANCE
THERMOSTABILITY OF PET
HYDROLASES
As mentioned previously, enzymatic treatment at high
temperature favors the hydrolysis of PET. High temperature
above PET Tg(70C) increases PET/organic polymers
mobility, thereby allowing more accessibility to ester links
between monomeric units (Shirke et al., 2018). However, high
temperature (>70C) results in kinetic instability and loss of
activity. Various methods, viz. use of ionic liquids (Jia et al.,
2013) phthalic anhydride and glucosamine hydrochloride
(Liu et al., 2002) or through other suitable modiﬁers like
Ca2C(DeSantis and Jones, 1999; Miyakawa et al., 2015)
and immobilization on suitable matrices (Kumar et al.,
2006; Singh et al., 2013), have been used to increase the
thermostability of PET hydrolases. The next section discusses
some of these approaches.
Screening and Sourcing of Heat-Stable
Enzymes From Hyperthermophilic
Microbes
Thermozymes from thermophilic organisms are one of the
important sources of heat-stable enzymes. These enzymes possess

Maurya et al. Enzymatic Remediation of PET Plastics
various adaptive strategies that help them to function in high
temperature. These adaptive strategies are very well covered
in the review of Han et al. (2019) and Kumar et al. (2019).
These types of natural thermophilic PET hydrolases thus could
eﬃciently be used for the management of PET wastes.
Immobilization
To increase the catalytic eﬃciency, stability, speciﬁcity,
and selectivity of enzymes, immobilization of the
enzyme system in suitable matrices is usually carried out
(Samak et al., 2020). This enhancement in enzymatic
properties is due to favorable structural changes in
enzyme as a result of immobilization (Samak et al.,
2020). PET hydrolases/cutinases have been immobilized
on diﬀerent matrixes for increasing thermostability.
However, these immobilized systems were majorly used
for synthesis reactions instead of PET hydrolysis. To
date, there are limited reports on PET hydrolysis using
immobilized PET hydrolases.
Cutinases from HiC, immobilized on Lewatit VP OC
1600, not only enhance the thermostability at 90C but also
confer the enzyme conformational rigidity in the organic
surrounding having low water content (Su et al., 2018). This
immobilized HiC was later used for the synthesis of butyl
laureate using butanol and lauric acid in organic solvent–
rich media. Generally, solubility/rigidity of PET polymers
increases/lowers in organic solvents, thereby allowing easy
accessibility of enzyme to ester bonds of PET for eﬃcient
hydrolysis. Hence, this immobilized HiC could also be used for
the hydrolysis of PET. Similarly, Nikolaivits et al. (2017) used
cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) for the immobilization
of cutinases from Fusarium oxysporum. The immobilized
cutinases showed enhanced thermostability and the system
was eﬃciently used for the synthesis of short-chain butyrate
ester as a ﬂavoring compound. On the other hand, Barth
et al. (2016) applied cutinase from T. fusca KW3 (TfCut2)
immobilized on SulfoLink coupling resin and free LC-cutinase
for enhanced and complete hydrolysis of amorphous PET
ﬁlm at 60C. This dual enzymatic system resulted in a 2.4
fold high degradation rate at 60compared to free TfCut2 at
24 h of incubation. Table 3 enlists various immobilization
matrixes used for the immobilization of cutinases for increasing
thermostability and their applications in synthesis as well as
hydrolysis reactions.
Glycosylation of Enzyme
Attachment of polysaccharide chains “glycans” to proteins
is termed as glycosylation. Modiﬁcation of protease through
glycosylation resulted in a noticeable eﬀect on kinetics, structure,
folding, and stability of enzyme (Goettig, 2016). Glycosylation-
based modiﬁcation has been performed on cellulose (Greene
et al., 2015), lipase (Pinholt et al., 2010), and a-amylase (Hu
et al., 2019) to achieve enhance enzymatic thermostability. In
Thielavia terrestris, cutinase glycosylation was introduced that
inhibited thermal aggregation (Shirke et al., 2016b). Similarly,
glycosylation site engineering was introduced in the cutinase
ofA. oryzae showing the same eﬀect (Shirke et al., 2016a).Leaf and branch compost originated cutinase (LCC) was
glycosylated (LCC-G) and compared with non-glycosylated
(LCC-NG) (Shirke et al., 2018). Glycosylation helps the
protein to reach Tgtemperature of PET without adversely
aﬀecting the protein. Aggregation of LCC-NG was observed
at 70C due to hydrophobic interaction, whereas LCC-
G showed 10C higher temperature to achieve the same
level of aggregation.
Use of Surfactants and Additives
The activity of enzymes can be inﬂuenced by the application
of surfactants. Through binding with the enzymes, surfactants
can alter the secondary and tertiary structures or ﬂexibility
of enzyme, thereby aﬀecting the enzyme kinetic properties
(Rubingh, 1996). In addition to that, the use of surfactants
can also improve the dispersibility of PET particles and thus
may increase the accessibility of the substrate to enzymes. Chen
et al. (2010) in their study recorded increased degradation
of PET ﬁlm (73.65%) using cutinase from F. solani pisi in
presence of surfactant sodium taurodeoxycholate in the reaction
mixture. On the same note, the addition of surfactant alkyl
trimethyl ammonium chloride in the reaction media resulted
in complete degradation of PET at varied temperature using
Thermobiﬁda fusca double-mutant cutinase (TfCut2) (Furukawa
et al., 2019). Similarly, the use of additives, viz. Ca2C,
Mg2C, and hydrophobins (cysteine-rich proteins), has also
been used to increase the enzymatic PET hydrolysis (Espino-
Rammer et al., 2013; Then et al., 2015; Fukuoka et al., 2016;
Joo et al., 2018).
Hydrophobins are cysteine-rich fungal proteins laden with
high surface-active substances; it helps in creating interfaces
between hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases through their
natural tendency of absorption to hydrophobic surfaces (Ribitsch
et al., 2015). In this way, they assist in establishing proper
interaction of hydrophobic substrates with the active site of
enzymes. Several researchers fused hydrophobins with PET
hydrolases for increasing PET-hydrolyzing activity (Ribitsch
et al., 2015; Puspitasari et al., 2020). As far as Ca2Cis
concerned, cutinases possess three Ca2C-binding sites, and
this binding results in activation of the enzyme. Furthermore,
Ca2C-bound enzyme is prone to less ﬂuctuation compared
to the unbound form of an enzyme (Kawai et al., 2020).
This stability due to the binding of Ca2Cresults in higher
temperature tolerance and thus helps in PET hydrolysis (Kawai
et al., 2020). Furthermore, the fusion of PET hydrolases with
the substrate-binding module (SBM) also has been reported
to increases PET hydrolysis. Enzymes acting on an insoluble
substrate contain SBM for proper interaction with substrates.
Altering the surface properties of cutinases through fusion
with SBM from other enzymes facilitates the absorption of
PET and vis-à-vis PET hydrolysis (Kawai et al., 2020). In this
regard, Ribitsch et al. (2013) fused cutinase from Thermomyces
cellullosylitica (Thc_Cut1) separately with the carbohydrate-
binding module of cellobiohydrolase I from Trichoderma
reesei and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)–binding module of
polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerase from Alcaligenes faecalis.
The catalytic domain of cutinase was linked with SBM through

the spacer and thereafter cloned and expressed in Escherichia
coli. Both fused enzymes showed enhanced hydrophobic
interactions with PET and catalytic degradation compared to
native cutinase.
Use of Ultrasonic Waves
Ultrasonic waves are high-frequency waves exceeding 20 kHz
and are used to increase the enzymatic PET hydrolysis. Pellis
et al. (2016) visualized the eﬀect of ultrasonic waves on
enzymatic reaction and observed enhanced PET hydrolysis of
various CrI. Sonication of amorphous PET (8% CrI) with
Thc_Cut1 (cutinase) during hydrolysis reaction showed an
increase of 5.2-fold in TA concentration and 6.6-fold in MHET
concentration compared to control. The same reaction with
PET of 28% CrI resulted in 2.9-fold increase in TA level.
For amorphous PET, better enzymatic hydrolysis was observed
with 10 min of sonication, whereas for high-CrI PET, it was
observed to be 30 min. According to Pellis et al. (2016),
sonication causes changes in the secondary structure of an
enzyme, and this unfolding/changes with exposed hydrophobic
groups lead to increased enzyme–substrate aﬃnity and vis-à-
visenhanced hydrolysis rate. Also, the lesser hydrolytic rate
observed in the case of ﬁlm substrate (PET) compared toamorphous PET is due to less accessibility to the substrate
surface in a ﬁlm.
Use of Mixture of Enzymes
Use of consortia/mixture of enzymes viz. lipases, esterases, and
cutinases has been reported by various authors for increasing PET
hydrolysis. Carniel et al. (2017) investigated the synergistic study
with HiC and CALB. HiC acts as PETase and converts PET to
MHET, whereas CALB acts as MHETase converting MHET to
TPA or BHET to TPA. The mixture of enzymes causes a 7.7-
fold increase in TPA as compared to HiC alone. With synergistic
action of enzymes, degradation is found to be eﬀective with
hcPET bottles also.
Engineered Enzymes
In the recent past few years, the most thrilling development is
the application of genetic engineering to enzyme technology.
A number of enzymatic properties can be altered or improved by
genetic engineering to achieve better kinetics of the enzyme and
easy downstream processing. This process/technique includes
changing amino acid sequences through recombinant DNA
mutation. In this regard, double mutation of PETase caused
increased PET degradation as a result of more interaction and

high binding aﬃnity with the PET (Ma et al., 2018). Similarly,
Furukawa et al. (2019) worked with T. fusca double-mutant
cutinase and observed complete PET degradation.
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on T. fusca cutinase
(Tfu_0883), thereby enhancing its activity on PET through
substituting bulky amino acid on active site by smaller residue
such as alanine (Silva et al., 2011). This provides a less restrained
active site to Tfu_0883 and allows better accommodation of
PET. Cutinase (Cut190) from S. viridis AHK190 is the only
cutinase exhibiting inactive or active state based on binding
of Ca2Cin its binding site, where it (Ca2C) plays activation
and thermal stabilization functions (Oda et al., 2018). Cut190
has three Ca2C-binding sites having diﬀerent amino acids at
each site. A mutant at these sites has shown the highest
Tmvalues and highest PET degradation of (0.25-mm-thick
ﬁlm of amorphous PET, CrI of 6.3%) more than 30% at
70C (Oda et al., 2018). Recently, Tournier et al. (2020)
modiﬁed earlier known as leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC)
using site-speciﬁc saturation mutagenesis through altering 11
amino acid residues in the enzyme active site. The resulting
modiﬁed enzyme showed more than 90% depolymerization
of PET into monomers within 10 h of treatment. According
to the authors, this is the fastest PET-hydrolyzing enzyme
reported so far.
CONSTRAINTS WITH ENZYMATIC PET
HYDROLYSIS
Although PET hydrolases, viz. cutinase, PETase, lipase, and
esterase, have been reported to hydrolyze PET in various forms,
but the following constraints usually lower the eﬃcacy of
the process:
(1) Low catalytic turnover due to limited accessibility to active
sites as a result of high CrI of the substrate.
(2) Inhibition by MHET or intermediate metabolites.
(3) Kinetic instability and loss of activity at the temperature
above PETs Tg(70C) (Shirke et al., 2018).
(4) During biodegradation/hydrolysis, solution gets acidic due
to end products leading to inactivation of enzyme and
hence slower reaction rate.CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS
Among various available methods known for recycling PET,
enzymatic methods are considered an environmentally safer
and eﬃcient method for managing the PET wastes. Enzyme
prominently cutinases are proved to be quite eﬀective in PET
hydrolysis. Enzymatic hydrolysis of PET is favored at high
temperature, but limited PET hydrolases are known to be active
at high temperature. Thus, kinetic instability of enzymes at
high temperature is one of the major constraints toward PET
hydrolysis. In addition to that, high CrI and low solubility of
the substrate and acidic pH of the media during hydrolysis are
some of the major factors limiting the hydrolysis rate. However,
various modiﬁcations such as glycosylation and immobilization
of enzymes could be used to enhance thermostability and enzyme
activity toward PET. High-CrI PET has higher Tg, and for
hydrolysis of these PET, there is a need for enzymes that are
stable at such high temperature. Most industries use high CrI
plastics, which have high tensile strength and stiﬀness and are
less aﬀected by solvents. Recycling such plastics has become a
tedious problem. Additionally, enzymatic treatment of mixed
wastes arising from the textile industry too is a problem, as this
enzyme needs to have broad substrate speciﬁcity. If the search
for a novel thermostable PET-hydrolyzable enzyme capable of
hydrolyzing hcPET with broad substrate speciﬁcity is fulﬁlled,
then this will ultimately help in the overall curbing of plastic
pollution in a sustainable pattern.

Exploring the catabolic repertoire of natural bacteria for biodegradation of plastics is
one of the priority areas of biotechnology research. Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) is
recalcitrant and poses serious threats to our environment. The present study explored
the LDPE biodegradation potential of aerobic bacteria enriched from municipal waste
dumpsite and bentonite based drilling ﬂuids from a deep subsurface drilling operation.
Considerable bacterial growth coupled with signiﬁcant weight loss of the LDPE beads
(8%), change in pH to acidic condition and bioﬁlm cell growth around the beads (CFU
count 105–106/cm2) were noted for two samples (P and DF2). The enriched microbial
consortia thus obtained displayed high (65–90%) cell surface hydrophobicity, conﬁrming
their potential toward LDPE adhesion as well as bioﬁlm formation. Two LDPE degrading
bacterial strains afﬁliated to Stenotrophomonas sp. and Achromobacter sp. were
isolated as pure culture from P and DF2 enrichments. 16S rRNA gene sequences of
these isolates indicated their taxonomic novelty. Further biodegradation studies provided
strong evidence toward the LDPE metabolizing ability of these two organisms. Atomic
Fore Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed considerable
damage (in terms of formation of cracks, grooves, etc.) on the micrometric surface of the
LDPE ﬁlm. Analysis of the average roughness (Ra), root mean square roughness (Rq),
average height (Rz), maximum peak height (Rp), and maximum valley depth (Rv) (nano-
roughness parameters) through AFM indicated 2–3 fold increase in nano-roughness of
the LDPE ﬁlm. FTIR analysis suggested incorporation of alkoxy (1000–1090 cm 1), acyl
(1220 cm 1), nitro (1500–1600 cm 1), carbonyl (1720 cm 1) groups into the carbon
backbone, formation of N-O stretching (1360 cm 1) and chain scission (905 cm 1)
in the microbially treated LDPEs. Increase in carbonyl index (15–20 fold), double
bond index (1.5–2 fold) and terminal double bond index (30–40 fold) conﬁrmed that
biodegraded LDPEs had undergone oxidation, vinylene formation and chain scission.
The data suggested that oxidation and dehydrogenation could be the key steps allowing
formation of low molecular weight products suitable for their further mineralization by
the test bacteria. The study highlighted LDPE degrading ability of natural bacteria and
provided the opportunity for their development in plastic remediation process.

Dey et al. Biodegradation of Unpretreated LDPE
INTRODUCTION
Despite being a severe threat to the environment, plastic has
become a very fundamental part of human society (Danso
et al., 2019). It is widely used in various ﬁelds ranging from
industries, agriculture to our day to day life, due to its lightness,
durability, inertness and cheapness, etc., (Orr et al., 2004;
Sudhakar et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2020). Plastics are polymers
of small aliphatic (for example polyethylene is made of [CH 2–
CH 2] monomer) or aromatic molecules (e.g., polystyrene is a
polymer of styrene) and their derivatives (such as polyvinyl
chloride made from vinyl chloride monomer) (Andrady and
Neal, 2009; Y ang et al., 2014). Almost 6.3 billion tons of
plastics were produced worldwide in 2015 and the number is
increasing exponentially each year because of its eﬃcient and
versatile use (Yuan et al., 2020). Although plastics bring ease
to our daily life, their uncontrolled use and careless disposal
have been imposing a constant threat to the ecosystem, since
they don’t get degraded naturally even after many years and
interfere with various natural and engineered processes adversely
(Albertsson and Karlsson, 1990; Tokiwa et al., 2009; Raddadi
and Fava, 2019). Non/slow biodegradation of plastics has led
to their accumulation in the environment, thus causing wide
spread pollution and harming marine as well as terrestrial life
forms (Raddadi and Fava, 2019; Li et al., 2020). Plastics not
only cause ﬂooding by blocking the water draining system,
but also get incorporated into the food chain of animals and
damage their digestive system (Teuten et al., 2009; Muhonja
et al., 2018). Long term accumulation of plastics in soil even
changes its microbial community structure (Harshvardhan and
Jha, 2013; Huang et al., 2019; Fei et al., 2020). Although,
the amount of plastic wastes is reduced by incineration, it
leads to secondary pollution due to the production of air
pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, etc., (Ru
et al., 2020). The weathering and breaking down of plastic
produce microplastics (MP) which migrate toward rivers, ponds,
lakes, oceans and agricultural ﬁelds and aﬀect them adversely
(Yuan et al., 2020). Most of the commercially used plastics like
polyethylene (PE) (low density, i.e., LDPE and high density or
HDPE), polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
polyamide (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are usually
resistant toward biodegradation (Tokiwa et al., 2009; Danso
et al., 2019). Their biodegradability is generally hindered due to
several factors such as, (1) not being able to enter the microbial
cell because of high molecular weight, (2) better stability in
chemical structure, (3) absence of functional groups where
microbial enzymes can attack and (4) high hydrophobicity and
degree of crystallinity due to large carbon backbone (Tokiwa
et al., 2009; Y ang et al., 2014). Environmental toxicity, large-
scale accumulation and persistence of plastics warrant immediate
action on development of eﬃcient and ecofriendly methods
for their degradation and exploration of microbial catabolic
potential toward biodegradation of plastics (Montazer et al., 2018;
Danso et al., 2019).
It has been found that the most common plastic, e.g.,
polyethylene (PE) can be subjected to microbial degradation
if it is made with added pro-oxidants (generally transitionmetals) (Lee et al., 1991; Bonhomme et al., 2003). It has
been observed that microbial growth and thus degradation
of PE can be facilitated by several pretreatments like photo-
oxidation (by exposing under UV irradiation), heat treatment
(heating with high temperature) or chemical treatment (using
acid). These pretreatments usually reduce the hydrophobicity by
incorporating various functional groups (carbonyl, keto, nitro,
etc.) into the inert carbon backbone (Albertsson et al., 1987;
Orr et al., 2004; Hadad et al., 2005). The complex process of
complete biodegradation of polyethylene follows these steps:
(a) fragmentation by microbial intervention (adhering to the
surface of polyethylene) or environmental components and
incorporation of functional groups if applicable; (b) breaking
down of polymer into oligomers or monomers as well as
fatty acids, ketons, aldehydes, alcohols, etc., by enzymatic
attack and free radicals; (c) uptake of these small products
inside the microbial cells; (d) utilization of those molecules
in cellular metabolism and ﬁnally production of CO 2, N 2,
CH 4, H 2O, etc., (Y ang et al., 2014; Wilkes and Aristilde,
2017; Muhonja et al., 2018; Delacuvellerie et al., 2019; Park
and Kim, 2019). Both culture-based and culture-independent
metagenomic studies have highlighted the PE (LDPE or
HDPE) biodegradation abilities of several bacterial taxa viz.
Enterobacter, Bacillus (Y ang et al., 2014); Brevibacillus (Hadad
et al., 2005); Pseudomonas (Muhonja et al., 2018); Alcanivorax,
Ideonella, Marinobacter, Arenibacter (Delacuvellerie et al.,
2019); Aneurinibacillus (Raddadi and Fava, 2019); Chelatococcus
(Yoon et al., 2012); Achromobacter (Kowalczyk et al., 2016);
Comamonas, Stenotrophomonas and Delftia (Peixoto et al.,
2017). Besides, several members of soil-inhabiting Actinobacteria
(Rhodococcus sp.,Streptomyces coelicoﬂavus, Streptomyces KU1,
KU5, KU6, KU8, Streptomyces werraensis, Streptomyces humidus,
Streptomyces parvullus, Streptomyces aburaviensis, Amycolatopsis
sp. HT-32, Nocardia sp.Saccharothrix wayandensis, etc.) have
shown either weight reduction or partial degradation of PE ﬁlms
(Sivan et al., 2006; Abraham et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019;
Soulenthone et al., 2020). Among the fungal species, members
ofAspergillus (Muhonja et al., 2018); Fusarium (Sivan, 2011);
Penicillium, Zalerion (Raddadi and Fava, 2019); Chaetomium
and Pullularia (Sudhakar et al., 2008) are well known for
biodegradation of LDPEs and HDPEs. Microbial enzymes
playing important role in biodegradation of PE are identiﬁed to
be proteases, lipases, cutinases, laccases, manganese peroxidases,
lignin peroxidases, alkane hydroxylases, etc., (Tokiwa et al., 2009;
Bhardwaj et al., 2013; Wei and Zimmermann, 2017; Ahmed et al.,
2018). Most of the prior studies have been done to assess the
biodegradation of pretreated PEs. It is also observed that LDPE
biodegradation takes place in a very slow manner even after
the pretreatment (Sivan, 2011). In comparison to these studies,
biodegradation of un-pretreated LDPE is not yet well studied.
Identiﬁcation and characterization of microbial enzymes and
their molecular mechanisms have been considered to be critical in
order to develop biotechnological process for plastic remediation
(Danso et al., 2019).
The present study was conducted as a ﬁrst step toward
development of microbial plastic bioremediation through
evaluating the potential of natural microbial communities and

isolating suitable bacterial strains with desirable biocatalytic
abilities. LDPE biodegradation potential of naturally occurring
aerobic microorganisms (present in municipal waste dump
site soil and bentonite based drilling ﬂuids used during
deep drilling of igneous crust of Deccan Traps, India) was
evaluated by using enrichment culture technique. Degradation
of LDPE by the enriched microorganisms was evaluated through
a number of analytical techniques including examining the
weight loss (of LDPE), change in its surface morphology
(SEM and AFM) and chemical modiﬁcation (FTIR). Two
selected bacterial strains isolated from these enrichments
were further studied for their individual ability of LDPE
biodegradation. These strains were identiﬁed through 16S rRNA
gene sequencing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PE Materials, Samples for
Microbiological Isolation, Media and
Growth Conditions
Two low-density polyethylene (PE) materials were used in this
study as the carbon source: (a) Low Density Polyethylene beads
(LDPE beads) (Sigma-Aldrich, United States) (b) Low Density
Polyethylene plastic ﬁlms (LDPE plastic ﬁlms) (Ranco Poly Bags,
Haryana, India). Before use, LDPE beads and ﬁlms were surface
sterilized by washing with 70% ethanol and followed by exposing
them to UV rays for 15 min.
Two types of environmental samples were used as the source
of LDPE degrading microorganisms: (1) waste plastic sample
from landﬁll soil and (2) drilling ﬂuid. Waste plastic samples
were collected from the local landﬁll site (designated as P)
inside the IIT Kharagpur campus (2218’ 45.3” N 8719’
28.1” E). The drilling ﬂuid (designated as DF2, DF4, DF7)
samples were collected during a 3 km deep pilot borehole (KFD-
1) drilling in the Koyna region (1724’ 6” N 7345’8” E) of
the Deccan Traps, Maharashtra under the pilot phase of the
Koyna scientiﬁc drilling project (Bose et al., 2020; Roy and
Bansal, 2020). The various depths were as follows: DF2: 1901.255
mbs; DF4:2335.62 mbs; DF7: 2908.52 mbs (mbs: meters below
surface). Samples were collected in sterile autoclaved bags with
the help of sterile equipment. The DF samples were kept at
4C during transportation to lab and thereafter they were
transferred to 80C and stored until further processing.
Dumpsite plastic samples were collected from ﬁve sites and
stored at 4C. They were mixed to use as an inoculum for
setting the enrichment within 48 h of sample collection. Drilling
ﬂuid (1 g each) samples were incubated with 10 mL sodium
pyrophosphate (0.1% w/v) overnight under shaking condition
to dislodge the cells, and one mL of the supernatant was used
as ﬁnal inoculum.
The carbon free basal medium used for the enrichment
of LDPE degrading bacteria had the following composition:
12.5 g/L K 2HPO 4; 3.8 g/L KH 2PO 4; 1.0 g/L (NH 4)2SO4; 0.1 g/L
MgSO 47H 2O (pH 7.0) and 5 mL trace element solution was
mixed in 1 L of the medium. The trace element solution consistedof the following: 0.232 g/L H 3BO 3; 0.174 g/L ZnSO 47H 2O;
0.116 g/L FeSO 4(NH 4)2SO46H 2O; 0.096 g/L CoSO 47H 2O;
0.022 g/L (NH 4)6Mo 7O244H 2O; 8.0 g/L CuSO 45H 2O; 8.0 g/L
MnSO 44H 2O (Kyaw et al., 2012). Reasoner’s 2A agar (modiﬁed
to reduce the carbon content by 10 fold) was used for isolation of
bacterial strains containing the following components: 0.05 g/L
Yeast extract, 0.05 g/L Peptone, 0.5 g/L Casamino acid, 0.05 g/L
Glucose, 0.05 g/L Starch, 0.3 g/L K 2HPO 4, 0.05 g/L MgSO 4,
0.3 g/L Sodium Pyruvate; 15 g/L Agar. The composition of
modiﬁed Luria Bertani (LB) agar medium (M/5) used to
determine the bioﬁlm cell growth was as follows: Casein enzyme
hydrolyzate 2 g/L, Yeast extract 1 g/L, Sodium chloride 2 g/L,
Agar 15 g/L (pHD7.50.2). All the enrichment setups
were incubated aerobically at 30C in an incubator shaker at
150 rpm for 100 days.
Enrichment (Setup) and Isolation of PE
Degrading Bacteria
P (approximately 10 pieces) and DF (DF2, DF4, DF7) (1 mL)
samples were inoculated in 100 mL of basal medium with LDPE
as C source. Ten sterilized LDPE beads of around 0.3 g were
used as the sole carbon source. Along with that, separate negative
control (without inoculum) was prepared. The samples along
with negative control (without bacterial inoculum) were kept
at 30C for 100 days in an incubator shaker (150 rpm). All
experiments were set up in duplicates.
After incubation, bioﬁlm or the bacteria present on the
surface of the plastic beads were collected according to Kyaw
et al. (2012). The beads were immersed in 2 mL of 0.9%
NaCl. They were incubated overnight at room temperature.
After incubation, they were vortexed properly for few minutes
in order to prepare a cell suspension. Hundred mL liquid cell
suspension from each sample was inoculated on the modiﬁed
R2A agar and kept for incubation at 30C for 48 h. The
colonies obtained were sub-cultured on the same medium for
further studies.
Measurement of Microbial Cell Growth
and Change in Medium pH
Following microbial growth, bioﬁlm formation on the surface
of the LDPE beads was determined according to the method
described by Manijeh et al. (2008). LDPE beads from enrichment
cultures were suspended into 0.9% NaCl and vortexed after
overnight incubation as described earlier. The resulting
suspension was serially diluted within 0.9% NaCl up to 105
fold and 0.1 mL of the diluted sample was plated on modiﬁed
Luria Bertani Agar plates. The CFU was counted after overnight
incubation at 30C and the following formula was used to
determine the bioﬁlm cell growth.
Bioﬁlm cell growth D log [(average CFU/drop
volume)(dilution counted) (volume scraped into/
surface area)].
In order to measure the microbial growth after incubation,
1 mL of liquid suspension was taken and absorbance (OD 600)
was determined using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. Similarly,
change in pH was also monitored using a pH meter.

Dey et al. Biodegradation of Unpretreated LDPE
PE Weight Reduction and Hydrophobicity
LDPE beads recovered from the enrichment cultures after
100 days of incubation were washed properly to remove the
microbial cells to get the accurate measurement of the weight.
These beads were incubated with 2% (w/v) aqueous sodium
dodecyl sulfate solution for 4 h in shaking condition, followed
by washing with distilled water and 70% ethanol in order to
remove the bacterial cells and other cell debris (Orr et al.,
2004). The beads were dried at 70C. The weight reduction
percentage was calculated using the formula mentioned below
(Kyaw et al., 2012).
Percentage of Weight Reduction D(Initial Weight – Final
Weight)100/Initial Weight
Bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH) test was carried
out to calculate the bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity
(Rosenberg et al., 1980). Microorganisms enriched in the
diﬀerent setups were re-inoculated in R2A agar medium and
were allowed to grow until they reached mid-logarithmic phase.
The microbial cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation and
washed with PBS buﬀer (pH 7.1). The washed cell pellets were
re-suspended in fresh PBS buﬀer. Aliquots of 4 mL each were
transferred from the resuspension to fresh test tubes and 1.5 mL
of hexadecane was added to them. Solution was vortexed for
2 min and kept still for 15 min to obtain the phase separation. The
optical density of the separated phase was measured at 600 nm
(OD 600). Cell-free buﬀer served as blank. Adherence percentage
to hexadecane or BATH was determined using the following
formula (Tribedi and Sil, 2013).
Cell surface hydrophobicity (%) D100{(initial OD – ﬁnal
OD)/initial OD}
Isolation and Identiﬁcation of LDPE
Degrading Bacterial Strains
Following 100 days of incubation, microbial cells present
on the LDPE surface of the enrichments, which displayed
better plastic degradation, were dislodged in 0.9% NaCl.
Hundred mL of cell suspension was plated on modiﬁed
R2A agar supplemented medium and incubated for 48 h
to obtain morphologically distinct colonies. The obtained
isolates were routinely sub-cultured on same medium at
30C and preserved with glycerol (25%, v/v) at  80C.
The genomic DNA of isolates (P2, DF22) was extracted
using DNA minikit protocol following SDS-Lysozyme lysis
and subsequent puriﬁcation using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol and ethanol (Mohapatra et al., 2018). The 16S rRNA
gene was ampliﬁed by PCR with bacterial universal primers
(27F: 50-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-30and 1492R: 50-
TACCTTGTTACGACTT-30). The PCR cycle composed of an
initial denaturation step at 95C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 95C
for 45 s, 58C for 45 s, 72C for 1.5 min, and with a
ﬁnal extension of 72C for 7 min. The PCR products were
gel puriﬁed using a Qia-quick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN),
cloned into pTZ57R/T vector (InsTA clone kit, Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States), and sequenced using
27F and 1492R, followed by extraction of true nucleotide
positions using BioEdit version 7.2.5. Assembly of the wholestretch was done using CAP contig assembly program of BioEdit
to obtain1000 bp sequence of 16S rRNA gene. Homology
search for maximum similarity of the 16S rRNA gene sequences
was carried out using identity tool of EzTaxon-e server1and
BlastN of NCBI database considering validly published and
eﬀectively described type species. Whereas 16S rRNA gene
sequences of other non-type species were obtained from NCBI
database. Multiple alignments were performed with CLUSTALW
package of MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018), where all ambiguous
positions were removed in the ﬁnal dataset using pairwise
deletion option. Phylogenetic reconstruction and validation were
performed using neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm (Saitou and
Nei, 1987) with 1000 bootstrap re-iterations using Jukes-Cantor
distance model (Jukes and Cantor, 1969). Both maximum-
likelihood (ML; Felsenstein, 1981) and minimum-evolution (ME;
Takahashi and Nei, 2000) methods were employed to test the
robustness of the trees. The sequences were submitted to NCBI
GenBank under the accession numbers: MT929273 (DF22)
and MT929274 (P2).
PE Biodegradation by Isolated Bacterial
Strains
The isolated bacterial strains were checked for their plastic
degradation potential. The freshly grown cells (1%) were added
to 100 mL of basal medium, where 10 pieces of sterile plastic
ﬁlms of around 2 cm2each (total 0.24 g) were used in each
sample as sole carbon source. They were incubated aerobically
at 30C in shaking condition at 150 rpm. After 45 days, the set
ups were examined to check the biodegradation of the plastic
ﬁlms. A control which had no inoculum was incubated along
with the samples.
Morphological Analysis of PE ﬁlms by
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
Changes on the surface of PE ﬁlms due to the treatment of
bacteria were visualized under Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)
(Agilent Technologies Inc., United States). The polythene ﬁlms
were taken out from the basal medium and they were thoroughly
washed with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate to clean the surface.
Thereafter, the ﬁlms were dried overnight at 50C and the dried
PE ﬁlms were used for examination under AFM (Gajendiran
et al., 2016). The LDPE samples were analyzed with a scan speed
of 1.0 Hz and a resolution of 256 256 pixels.
Surface Morphology Analysis of PE Films
by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
PE ﬁlms were also visualized under Scanning Electron
Microscope (SEM), in order to examine the surface morphology
changes due to microbial action. The PE ﬁlms were treated with
2% SDS and dried at 50C as described above in order to remove
the microbial cells and associated derbies. Finally, they were gold
coated, and viewed under SEM (SEM, ZEISS and Focused Ion
Beam SEM, Germany) using a Cu grid at 2500X magniﬁcation
(Das and Kumar, 2015).

Dey et al. Biodegradation of Unpretreated LDPE
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FTIR) of PE Films
The modiﬁcation of polyethylene in terms of chemical bonds
due to the action of the isolated bacterial strains was
assessed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (Thermo
Scientiﬁc IR Spectrophotometer, United States). Microbially
treated and untreated polyethylene ﬁlms were taken out after
45 days and washed with 2% SDS and dried at 50C as
described earlier. Finally, control and treated PEs were analyzed
under the IR spectrophotometer using transmission mode
(Kowalczyk et al., 2016).
RESULTS
Enrichment of PE Degrading Bacterial
Cells and Indication of Degradation
Enrichment of PE degrading bacterial cells was attempted by
incubating LDPE beads with four diﬀerent samples (namely,
P , DF2, DF4, and DF7). Following 100 days’ incubation,
various parameters related to cell growth and change in culture
pH were measured. Cell growth was measured in terms of
culture OD followed by measurement of primary indication
of plastic biodegradation by monitoring weight reduction of
the LDPE beads, cell surface hydrophobicity and bioﬁlm cell
growth (Figure 1).
The OD 600of the medium showed signiﬁcant change in
turbidity, thus indicating possible cell growth following 100 days’
incubation. Highest absorbance was shown by DF7, followed
byP>DF4 and DF2 displayed the least (Figure 1A).
Control set showed very low OD. Bioﬁlm growth measured
by recovering the LDPE beads from the incubation ﬂasks
showed considerable cell growth (Figure 1B). Compared to
control beads with negligible CFU counts, beads from P
setup yielded highest CFU of 106/cm2, followed by the beads
from DF4 culture (6 105/cm2)>DF2 (3105/cm2)
and DF7 (9104/cm2). It was noticed that the sample
treated with landﬁll plastic associated soil (P) showed higher
bioﬁlm cell growth compared to the samples inoculated with
drilling ﬂuids (DF).
Compared to nearly unaltered pH of the control set, a drastic
change in solution pH tending toward acidic pH from neutral
pH was noted for all the biotic samples (Figure 1C). Among
these, P showed a maximum decrease in pH (from pH 7.0 to
pH 5.6) followed by DF2 (pH 6.0 from pH 7.0). Signiﬁcant
weight loss of the LDPE beads was observed in this study
following their incubation (Figure 1E). Drilling ﬂuid sample
DF2 showed maximum reduction (7.54%) followed by P (7.45%),
much higher than the untreated sample (no change in weight).
This was a preliminary estimation of degradation since the
bacteria present in the samples would utilize polyethylene, which
was the only carbon source, thus leading to weight reduction of
the plastic (Kyaw et al., 2012). The cell surface hydrophobicity
was determined by BATH assay, which revealed that all the
treated samples had more than 80% hydrophobicity except
drilling ﬂuid sample DF2 (having 66.42%) but the untreatedsample (C) had only 11.11% hydrophobicity (Figure 1D). This
assay showed the aﬃnity of the bacterial cells toward the
organic hydrocarbon thus highlighting the capability of enriched
microbes in adhering to the polyethylene surface. This might
result in enhancing the bioﬁlm formation and degradation
process (Sarker et al., 2020).
Depending on the abovementioned parameters, it was
conferred that the samples P and DF2 showed better response
toward biodegradation and they were selected for further analyses
as well as isolation of bacterial strains. Two morphologically
distinct LDPE degrading bacterial isolates were obtained as
pure culture from P and DF2 enrichments. These two isolates
(designated as P2 and DF22) were identiﬁed and further
characterized for their LDPE degrading ability.
16S rRNA Gene Phylogenetic Analysis of
PE Degrading Isolates
EzTaxon and BLAST based comparative homology analysis
of 16S rRNA gene sequences (1000 bp) of PE degrading
isolates, P2 and DF22 showed belongingness to members
ofStenotrophomonas and Achromobacter, respectively. Isolate
P2 displayed maximum identities of 99.4% to type strain of
Stenotrophomonas pavanii DSM 25135T, followed by other
Stenotrophomonas type species (95.48–98.56%). Whereas isolate
DF22 showed maximum of 97.6% identity to type strain
ofAchromobacter xylosoxidans NBRC 15126T, followed by
<97.0% similarity with all other type members. Neighbor-
joining phylogenetic reconstruction showed that P2 formed
coherent cluster with the type strain S. pavanii DSM 25135T,
while DF22 showed its maximum evolutionary closeness with
several members ( A. xylosoxidans NBRC 15126, EC3, A. insolitus
DSM 23807, etc.) (Figure 2). Bootstrap re-sampling analysis
together with combined ML and ME based phylogeny displayed
similar tree topology demonstrating a strong association of
Stenotrophomonas P2 with its closest relative S. pavanii DSM
25135T. Whereas, Achromobacter sp. DF22 was denoted to be
phylogenetically distinct among Achromobacter spp.
Phylogenetic analysis involving various plastics (LDPE,
HDPE)/polymer degrading type- and non-type members
of Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter from diﬀerent
habitats showed that isolate P2 was taxonomically closest to
the S. pavanii PDS-5, which has been characterized to be a
polyethylene degrading bacterium from contaminated habitat.
Thus, it denoted species level aﬃliation of P2 to the S. pavanii
members (Figure 2). Isolate DF22 showed distant relatedness
with plastic/polymer degrading Achromobacter species
members (Figure 2). Isolates P2 and DF22 were designated
asStenotrophomonas sp. P2 and Achromobacter sp. DF22.
Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning
Electron Microscopy
Changes in surface morphology of the LDPE ﬁlms were examined
by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The topography images
of the treated ﬁlms showed formation of grooves, corrosions,
cracks and pits, etc., (Figures 3B,C). These changes were not
observed in the untreated samples (Figure 3A). Modiﬁcation

in the surface morphology might be facilitated due to the
action of microorganisms in the treated samples. AFM also
indicated toward changes in the roughness of the surface,
thus giving an overall idea on surface modiﬁcation of the
treated samples. The incubation for 45 days with the isolated
strains caused signiﬁcant increase in nano-roughness parameters,
namely Ra (mean deviation of roughness), Rq (root mean square
deviation of roughness), Rz (maximum height of roughness),
Rv (maximum valley depth of roughness), Rp (maximum peak
height of roughness) (Figure 3D ), when compared to the
untreated plastic. This indicated toward the formation of grooves
as the result of enzymatic degradation of the LDPE (Peixoto et al.,
2017). Stenotrophomonas sp. P2 displayed more maximum height
(154 nm) than Achromobacter sp. DF22 (132 nm) and untreated
ﬁlms had the lowest (80 nm) for the same. Maximum height
was the mathematical visualization of the topographs. It was
noticed that Stenotrophomonas sp. P2 displayed more diﬀerences
in maximum height, Rv, Rq, Ra and Achromobacter sp. DF22had more changes in Rz, Rp (Figures 3A–D). Post incubation,
roughness parameters were increased as much as two to three fold
due to the action of both the strains.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed next
to further validate the LDPE surface modiﬁcation due to the
enzymatic action of microbes. Signiﬁcant alterations on the
surface of treated (with microorganisms) ﬁlms were clearly
observed, indicating toward the primary release of debris due
to microbial action. Presence of cracks, erosions and grooves
was signiﬁcantly noted in the treated samples (Figures 4B,C);
whereas the surface of the control or the untreated LDPE was
mostly smooth (Figure 4A).
Assay of Biodegradation by
Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectroscopic analysis of the LDPE ﬁlms after 45 days
of incubation gave several insights into the process of chemical
bond modiﬁcation. When compared with the untreated plastic

ﬁlm, changes in FTIR spectra in few unique wavelengths in the
treated LDPE ﬁlms were found which conﬁrmed the modiﬁcation
of bonds and generation of new bonds or functional groups
in the polyethylene backbone due to the biotic treatment.
Majorly altered and the signiﬁcant characteristic bands were
found between 600 cm 1and 2000 cm 1. Treated and untreated
samples had few common peaks that belonged to polyethylene.
Peaks at 720 cm 1and near 1450 cm 1were formed due to
the long chain of C-H (bending vibration) (Y ang et al., 2014).
The peaks that were diﬀerent from the control represented
the main changes in chemical bonds and incorporation of
functional groups. The formation of alkoxy groups, C-O
(1000 cm 1to 1090 cm 1); nitro groups, N-O (1500 cm 1
to 1600 cm 1); acyl groups, C-O (peak at 1220 cm 1) and
carbonyl groups, C DO (peak near 1720 cm 1) was mainly
found. In addition, some other modiﬁcations were observed,
i.e., chain scission, H 2CDC- (905 cm 1) and N-O stretching
(peak at 1360 cm 1) (Figure 5A). The bacterial enzymes couldeasily utilize these groups as their function site. Also, the
double bond of carbon would be more accessible by bacteria
compared to C-C. Chemical bond formation and modiﬁcation
obtained through FTIR spectroscopy helped us to understand
the mechanism of enzymatic degradation of LDPE. Apart from
the graph, some indices like Carbonyl Index (CI), Double Bond
Index (DBI) and Terminal Double Bond Index (TDBI) were
calculated to evaluate functional bond formation and LDPE chain
modiﬁcations such as oxidation, vinylene formation and chain
scissioning (Figures 5B,C ). Treated LDPE showed signiﬁcant
increase in CI as much as 15–20 fold (Figure 5B) along with 1.5–
2 times increase in DBI and 30–40 fold rise in TBDI ( Figure 5C).
The signiﬁcant increase of the indices in case of the treated
samples was quite promising as a result of biodegradation. The
bacteria used LDPE as their source of carbon and made the
necessary changes incorporating the functional groups to modify
them into simpler products like alcohol, ketone, fatty acids, etc.,
(Peixoto et al., 2017).

DISCUSSION
Samples from municipal waste dumpsite soil and bentonite based
drilling ﬂuid from a deep subsurface drilling operation werecollected and used to enrich indigenous microorganisms capable
of LDPE biodegradation. Microbial populations inhabiting the
landﬁlls have been already explored by several researchers for
their polyethylene degrading potential (Gajendiran et al., 2016;

DF22 observed under SEM at 2500 ampliﬁcation. Changes on the surface
in terms of corrosion, crack formation, etc., were visible only for the treated
samples after the incubation period.
Kowalczyk et al., 2016; Muhonja et al., 2018; Park and Kim, 2019).
Regarding the microorganisms of drilling ﬂuids used in deep
subsurface drilling operations, various studies have reported their
taxonomic versatility and biodegradation potential (Alekhina
et al., 2007; Ozyurek and Bilkay, 2017, 2018; Bose et al., 2020).
Plastic metabolizing ability of such bacteria, however, has not
been explored in detail.
All the test samples were incubated aerobically in a
carbon free basal medium with LDPE beads as sole carbon
source for 100 days. Visible growth and turbidity in the
medium post incubation conﬁrmed the successful enrichment
of LDPE degrading microorganisms. Decrease of medium
pH to an acidic range suggested the metabolic activity of
the enriched cells (Duddu et al., 2015). The fragmentation
and depolymerization of LDPE would lead to the formation
of smaller molecular weight products such as fatty acids,
organic acids, etc., which might cause the decrease in pH(Das and Kumar, 2015; Karamanlioglu et al., 2017). Decrease in
medium pH and increase in absorbance of the medium for
all the samples established that the enriched microorganisms
could utilize LDPE as sole carbon source. This increase in
absorbance could also reﬂect the possibility of the presence of
fragmented LDPEs as a result of microbial action (Chatterjee
et al., 2010). These enrichment cultures and the LDPE beads
were subjected to series of tests for further evaluation of
their LDPE degradation potential. High bioﬁlm cell growth
and eﬀective colonization on the surface of the treated LDPE
beads in all the test samples indicated toward the enrichment
of LDPE degrading microorganisms. Bioﬁlm formation on the
surface of the hydrophobic and high molecular weight plastic
polymers, such as LDPE is considered as one of the most
important steps of microbial degradation of these polymers
(Sivan, 2011). Furthermore, it has been already reported that the
cells in bioﬁlms are known to secrete exopolysaccharides that
aid in their attachment to the surface of hydrophobic plastic
polymers (Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017 and reference therein).
Bioﬁlm formation enabled the microorganisms to attach and
eﬃciently utilize the non-soluble substrate viavarious enzymatic
reactions (Orr et al., 2004; Peixoto et al., 2017). High cell surface
hydrophobicity in all the test samples further conﬁrmed the
bioﬁlm formation, as the hydrophobicity of any organism has
a direct correlation with its potential to bind to non-polar
hydrocarbons such as polyethylene (Sanin et al., 2003; Tribedi
and Sil, 2013; Sarker et al., 2020). Highest weight loss of treated
LDPE beads recovered from P and DF2 samples indicated that
microbial consortia enriched from these two samples were more
eﬃcient in LDPE degradation. This weight reduction must have
taken place because of the enzymatic action of the enriched
microorganisms attached to the LDPE surface (Kyaw et al.,
2012; Gajendiran et al., 2016). These two microbial consortia
also displayed quite high metabolic activity. Overall, microbial
consortia enriched from both landﬁll and drilling ﬂuid samples
showed promising capability of LDPE degradation. Microbial
consortia enriched from P and DF2 samples were found to be
more eﬃcient toward LDPE degradation. They were further used
for isolation of LDPE degrading bacteria.
Two LDPE degrading bacterial isolates, P2 and DF22
were obtained as pure culture from these enrichments.
The isolated strains P2 and DF22 showed closest aﬃliation
with microorganisms belonging to Stenotrophomonas and
Achromobacter respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates
denoted species level aﬃliation of Stenotrophomonas sp. P2
to the S. pavanii members. Based on the published criteria
of<98.65% (cut-oﬀ) of 16S rDNA similarity for diﬀerentiating
two species members and description of new species (Kim
et al., 2014), Achromobacter sp. DF22 might represent a new
(novel) species within the genus Achromobacter. S. pavani PDS-5
(taxonomically closest to Stenotrophomonas sp. P2) has been
already identiﬁed as a potent polyethylene degrader (Mehmood
et al., 2016). Earlier studies have also reported the ability of
other microbial members (Table 1) belonging to this genus
toward plastic degradation (Abe et al., 2010; Peixoto et al., 2017;
Montazer et al., 2018). Besides, Stenotrophomonas spp. have
also been used for the bioremediation of organic pollutants

etc., (Chen et al., 2011; Papizadeh et al., 2011). These members
were found to be distantly related to Stenotrophomonas sp.
P2. Such phylogenetic clustering could be the result of similar
evolutionary changes and shared metabolic tendency as isolate
P2 showed its ability to degrade/impact the LDPE in the
medium and isolated as LDPE enriched culture. Microbial
members belonging to the genus Achromobacter have also
displayed their ability toward degradation of plastic based
polymers. Kowalczyk et al., 2016 has successfully tested HDPE
biodegradation ability of Achromobacter xylosoxidans, which
was isolated from landﬁll soil. Achromobacter sp. NBTU-02has shown its potential toward biodegradation of plastics
(Das et al., 2012). Along with these strains, some other strains
having polyethylene degrading capabilities had been isolated
from various environments and their potential toward PE
biodegradation was examined by determining weight reduction,
cell surface hydrophobicity, chemical modiﬁcation, surface
morphology changes, etc., (Table 1). Stenotrophomonas sp. P2
and Achromobacter sp. DF22 were further tested for their ability
toward LDPE degradation.
Both the strains were incubated aerobically for 45 days
in a carbon free basal medium, using LDPE ﬁlms as sole
C source. Following incubation, the ﬁlms were examined for

the evidences of changes in surface morphology and chemical
modiﬁcations by AFM, SEM and FTIR. Both, AFM and SEM
analyses conﬁrmed signiﬁcant modiﬁcations on the surface of
LDPE ﬁlms and weakening of their physical integrity due to
microbial action by both the strains (Li et al., 2020). Apart
from the visible modiﬁcations, almost 2–3 fold increase in nano-
roughness parameters namely Ra, Rv, Rp, Rq, and Rz added
stronger evidence to the alteration of roughness of the ﬁlms
because of microbial action. Higher values of Rz, which is
the maximum height, suggested toward the presence of biggrooves and pits (Peixoto et al., 2017). All the changes also
indicated toward the penetration of the bacterial cells into
the LDPE ﬁlm surface (Esmaeili et al., 2013). These results
indicated that the LDPE degradation had been initiated by
the plastic degrading strains due to their enzymatic action,
where laccase, esterase, mono-oxygenase, peroxidases might play
signiﬁcant role (Ahmed et al., 2018; Ru et al., 2020). In order
to support these results, chemical modiﬁcations of the LDPE
ﬁlms were determined by FTIR. Chemical modiﬁcation reﬂected
the change in carbon backbone and helped to understand the

formation of functional groups on LDPE or any molecule
formed during the degradation process. FTIR spectroscopy is
widely used as an eﬃcient analytical technique to identify
organic, polymeric and inorganic material and their chemical
conformation. This technique had been utilized in earlier studies
to display the chemical changes during plastic biodegradation
(Peixoto et al., 2017; Montazer et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020). New
functional groups (such as alkoxy, acyl, carbonyl, and nitro)
were found and modiﬁcations in terms of chain scissioning,
nitro stretching and double bond formation took place. Thus,
the hydrophobicity of inert LDPE was reduced due to the
incorporation of functional bonds to facilitate the microbial
action. Although the exact enzymatic reactions are yet to be
understood, the overall process of biodegradation and enzymatic
mechanism could be conceptualized from the FTIR analysis
(Figure 6). Together from the increased indices (CI, DBI, TDBI)
and the spectral analysis it could be inferred that the degradation
process might have been initiated by the formation of radicals
that helped in enhancing oxidation with the help of oxygen
and water. These oxidation products were then transformed
to the functional groups and vinylene group probably by
Norrish type I and Norrish type II mechanisms or stabilization.
Thus, the hydrophobicity of the plastic surface was reduced
so that the subsequent bacterial enzymes could enhance the
degradation process. Presence of alkoxy and acyl groups in the
treated samples indicated ester hydrolysis and alcohol formation
due to the action of microbial hydrolytic enzymes such as
cutinase, lipase, esterase and alkane monooxygenase. Formation
of carbonyl bonds could have occurred due to the action
of laccase. These ester, alcohol, etc., could be subsequently
converted to smaller fatty acids through an intermediate step of
aldehyde production by dehydrogenase enzymes. Thus, smaller
molecular products were formed and could be taken up by
the bacteria for metabolism, leading to mineralization via
b-oxidation (Ogihara, 1963; Albertsson et al., 1987; Orr et al.,2004; Szép et al., 2004; Chatterjee et al., 2010; Peixoto et al., 2017;
Ru et al., 2020). These processes resulted in the breaking down of
LDPE ﬁlms causing the surface changes on the ﬁlms.
CONCLUSION
This study displayed the LDPE biodegradation potential of
microbial consortium enriched (using LDPE as sole carbon
source) from dumpsite and drilling ﬂuids and the bacterial
strains isolated from these enrichments. Signiﬁcant microbial
growth, high cell surface hydrophobicity of the enriched
consortia and considerable weight reduction of treated LDPEs
gave a primary indication of the biodegradation capacity of
the enriched consortia. Two LDPE degrading bacterial strains
aﬃliated to Stenotrophomonas sp. and Achromobacter sp. were
isolated as pure culture from P and DF2 enrichments. SEM and
AFM analyses conﬁrmed that both the strains were successful
in altering the cell surface morphology of the LDPE beads. The
overview of possible mechanism of LDPE biodegradation by
these two strains was also established in this study. FTIR analysis
suggested that series of chemical changes starting from oxidation
followed by dehydrogenation led to the breaking down of LDPE
into smaller molecules, which could be subsequently utilized
by these two strains for their metabolism. Complete microbial
composition of the enrichments can be analyzed through next
generation sequencing based approach and would help us to
identify the complex network of biological systems involved in
LDPE degradation. This would enable us to develop a stable
microbial consortium capable of LDPE degradation, which could
be utilized for large-scale biodegradation of plastic. Further
investigation on the metabolic pathways, enzymatic reactions and
metabolites would help us understanding the exact mechanism
of biodegradation by these bacterial strains to develop in situ
process for LDPE biodegradation.

The textile and clothing industry is the ﬁrst manufacture sector in Tunisia in terms of
employment and number of enterprises. It generates large volumes of textile dyeing
wastewater (TDWW) containing high concentrations of saline, alkaline, and recalcitrant
pollutantsthatcouldfueltenaciousandresilientelectrochemicallyactivemicroorganisms
in bioanodes of bioelectrochemical systems. In this study, a designed hybrid bacterial
halothermotolerant bioanode incorporating indigenous and exogenous bacteria from
both hypersaline sediment of Chott El Djerid (HSCE) and TDWW is proposed for
simultaneous treatment of real TDWW and anodic current generation under high
salinity. For the proposed halothermotolerant bioanodes, electrical current production,
chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efﬁciency, and bacterial community dynamics

INTRODUCTION
The te
xtile and clothing industry has become one of the
most important sectors of activity. Despite the use of high-
tech equipment and modern technologies, it remains among
the highest water consuming industries. As reported by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the
production of 9,072kg of ﬁnished textile per day requires about
36,000L of water only for wet processing (Ghaly et al., 2014;
Berkes
sa et al., 2020). Moreover, almost the water consumed
generates
large volumes of textile dyeing wastewater (TDWW).
The TDWW contains more than 1.5 g/L of waste dye as the
uptakeofthesedyesbytextilefabricsisverypoor,highsalinityof
about 5–6% NaCl and 5% of Na 2SO4and other chemicals, such
as various acids, alkalis, sulfur, naphthol, surfactant-dispersing
agents, formaldehyde-based dye ﬁxing agents, hydrocarbon-
based softeners, and heavy metals (Verma et al., 2012; Lin
et al.,
2015; Pazdzior et al., 2018). Most of these chemicals and
productsof
theirdegradation,i.e.,metabolites,arerecalcitrantin
nature and severely aﬀect both aquatic and terrestrial life ( Ben
Mansour et
al., 2012; Kant, 2012; Chandrakant et al., 2016). It is
therefore
well-establishedthatthesehazardouspollutantsshould
be removed from TDWW by appropriate and eﬀective methods
priortotheirreleaseintotheenvironment.
Diﬀerent TDWW treatment methods and techniques have
been implemented and evaluated over the past two decades.
These methods involve (i) physical methods (coagulation–
ﬂocculation,adsorption,andﬁltrationtechniques),(ii)oxidation
methodscategorizedasadvancedoxidationprocesses(cavitation,
photocatalytic oxidation, Fenton chemistry) and chemical
oxidation using oxidizing agents (O 3and H 2O2), and (iii)
bioremediation methods (fungi, algae, bacteria) (Gosavi and
Sharma,
2014; Yeap et al., 2014; Chandrakant et al., 2016;
Chouchane et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018). For several reasons,
such
as eco-friendly, cost competitive, less sludge production,
and giving non-hazardous metabolites or full mineralization
(Hayat et al., 2015), the biological methods are qualiﬁed as the
most sust
ainable method for wastewater treatment. However,
biologicalmethodscannotguaranteetheachievementofrequired
results of the TDWW, as some of the dye molecules or
other chemical components are hazardous and/or recalcitrant
to microorganism-driven degradation. The most appropriate
method should be cost-eﬀective, valuable in the degradation
of resistant compounds, and produce safe and good quality
eﬄuent.Thereisthereforeagreatenvironmentalandeconomical
need to develop a processing technology that addresses these
severe challenges. Tenacious, resistant, and exoelectrogenic
microorganisms used in bioelectrochemical systems (BES) can
performthedualfunctionofdegradingpollutantsandrecovering
in the form of electrical energy, the energy resulting from the
oxidation of these pollutants. Indeed, previous studies reported
that exoelectrogenic populations have favorably demonstrated
an added value for the treatment of recalcitrant pollutants, such
as azo dyes, petroleum hydrocarbon, and heavy metals ( Adelaja
etal.,
2015;Choudhuryetal.,2017;Monzonetal.,2017;Grattieri
and Minteer, 2018; Vijay et al., 2018; Askri et al., 2019; Elabed
etal.,2019a,b ).Asalre
adyreportedby Xieetal.(2011),organicandinorganic
compound s
in TDWW contain almost ﬁve times more energy
than that consumed to treat it. Thus, it is hypothetically
possibletoextractelectricalenergyfromtheTDWWbyapplying
well-adapted electrochemically active microorganisms capable
of degrading recalcitrant pollutants, transmuting dangerous
metabolites, and capturing an electronic ﬂow that can be
converted into electrical energy under high salinity. In this
context, an earlier study by Askri et al. (2019) demonstrated
theenric
hmentofeﬃcientexoelectrogenicmicroorganismsfrom
hypersalinesedimentofChottElDjerid(HSCE)abletoproduce
a current density in the range of 7 A/m2under combined
hightemperatureandhypersalineconditions(temperature45◦C,
salinity 165 g/L) using lactate as carbon source, i.e., anodic fuel.
Halothermophilic microorganisms are thus suitable candidates
for the treatment of the high saline wastewaters generated, for
example,inthetextiledyeing(2–10g/L),seafoodprocessing(8–
20 g/L), tannery (40–80 g/L), and petroleum industries (few g/L
to 300 g/L) ( Shehab et al., 2017; Cherif et al., 2018; Askri et al.,
2019).
T
he aim
of this work was therefore to demonstrate, for the
ﬁrst time, proof of the feasibility of designating an eﬃcient
microbial halothermotolerant bioanodes from both hypersaline
sediment (HSCE) and saline TDWW microbium able to treat
textile wastewater and generating an electrical current collected
viaan electrode. At this stage of progress, the exploitation of
the anodic current ﬂow generated is not investigated at all.
It is only quantiﬁed in terms of bioelectrochemical kinetics,
from the acquisition of the J =f(E) curves. It is thus not at
all a question here of developing a microbial fuel cell (MFC),
a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), or any other BES, judged
too ﬂuctuating and random to focus attention on the precisely
targeted phenomenon, i.e., the formation of a bioanode without
limitation caused by a limiting step of a larger and more
complete BES process. On the contrary, bioanode formation
was studied here in three-electrode electrochemical bioreactor
installationstoensurewell-controlledelectroanalysisconditions,
as explained in the review by Rimboud et al. (2014), who
point out
the fundamental basic principles and advantages of
the three-electrode arrangement compared with MFC or other
BESdevices.
Once the potential for electrical current generation and
TDWW treatment of the halothermotolerant bioanodes
had been proven viaelectrochemical and analytical tools,
contributions of autochthonous microorganisms from
TDWW and allochthonous from HSCE were investigated
through comparative metagenomic analyses of bioﬁlms, HSCE,
andTDWW.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection of Hypersaline Sediment and
Textile Wastewater Samples
Hypersaline sediments used as inoculums were sampled from
an extreme environment Chott El Djerid, located in the south
of Tunisia (N 33◦59′965′′and E 08◦25′332′′). Samples were a

mixture of saturated water and sediment (2:1 vol.:vol.) collected
from
the surface with a conductivity higher than 200mS cm−1
(Askri et al., 2019). The TDWW was collected from “Sitex”
textile
industry located in Monastir, Tunisia (N 35◦39′06′′and
E 10◦53′03′′). All samples were conserved in closed plastic bags
andbottlesat +4◦Cuntilexperimentswerestarted.
General Condition of Three-Electrode
Bioelectrochemical Cell Conﬁguration and
Operation
All experiments were conducted in a 500ml glass three-
electrode reactor containing 80% of real textile eﬄuents and
20% of saline sediments. After the homogenization step,
reactors were hermetically closed without any gas ﬂow. A
conventional three-electrode system [working electrode (WE),
auxiliary electrode, and reference electrode] was implemented
with a VSP multichannel potentiostat (Biologic SAS) equipped
with EC lab software. The WE made of a porous carbon felt
of 6 cm2projected surface area was electrically connected to a
platinum wire (1mm diameter and 15cm long) and polarized
at−0.1 V/SCE. A platinum grid was used as the counter
electrode (CE), and a saturated calomel reference electrode
(+0.24 V/SHE) was located between the counter and the WEs.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in situbetween−0.6
and0.3V/SCEatascanrateof1mV.S−1.
Electrochemical Data Processing
Chronoamperometric (CA) maximum current densities of the
halothermotolerant bioﬁlms were carried out as indicated in the
previous study by Askri et al. (2019). CV was used to (i) validate

COD Measurement
The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate (%)
corresponds to the percentage of the total organic matter
eliminated in the wastewater. Therefore, COD change
monitoring is a relevant parameter to evaluate the performance
ofthehalothermotolerantbioanode.Themonitoringwascarried
outaccordingtothefollowingequation:
CODremovalrate =(CODinﬂuent−CODeﬄuent)/COD inﬂuent∗100
Samples were recuperated from anolytes of each reactor,
and the COD was measured using LCK 514 (100–2,000
mg/O2) after a 1/6 dilution and ﬁltration through the syringe
of the chloride elimination kit LCW925 (Hach Lange) to
remove any analytical interference from the chloride ions in
themedia.

then imaged with epiﬂuorescence microscopy as described by
Blanchet et al. (2016), Rousseau et al. (2016), and Askri et al.
(2019).
Microbial
Diversity Analysis of HSCE and
TDWW Samples and Bioﬁlms
Genomic DNA extractions from HSCE, TDWW, and bioﬁlms
were performed using a NucleoSpinR/circlecopyrtSoil kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity [absorbance ratio
(A260/A280)] and DNA concentration measurements (ng µl−1)
were checked by Nanodrop. Then, Illumina Miseq 16S rRNA
sequencing was performed in order to analyze the composition
ofthemicrobialcommunitiesinHSCEandTDWWsamplesand
indiﬀerentbioﬁlms.The16SrRNAgeneV4variableregionPCR
primers 515/806 were used in single-step 30 cycles PCR using
the HotStarTaqPlus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, USA). Sequencing
was performed at MR DNA (www.mrdnalab.com; Shallowater,
TX,USA).
Statistical Analyses
All experiments were performed in triplicates under the
same conditions to prove the reproducibility of experimental
results. The mentioned results are the average values with a
standarddeviation.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Bioanode Growth and Electrochemical
Characterization
Four microbial bioanodes were independently grown by
chronoamperometry with a VSP multichannel potentiostat
(Biologic SAS), setting the potential value of the WEs at −0.1
V/SCE. This electrode potential has particularly shown its
relevancetoeﬃcientlyleadtotheformationofparticularlyrobust
and eﬃcient bioanodes from wastewater (Blanchet et al., 2015)
andalso
fromsediments(Erableetal.,2017).
The four
bioanodes grown at this polarization potential are
referredtoasTDWW,TDWWS1,TDWWS2,andTDWWS3all
through the ﬁgures and text. The constant electric polarization
was maintained for 17 days, which is a reasonable amount of
time to obtain matured bioanode on carbon based electrodes
colonized by halo-exoelectrogenic bacteria (Erable et al., 2009;

au et al., 2014; González-Muñoz et al., 2018; Askri
et al., 2019). Current densities vs. time plots for −0.1 V/SCE

production was observed almost after 2 days of polarization for
all three bioanodes co-inoculated with HSCE, in comparison
with the TDWW bioanode, where current production was only
recorded from day 5 with very low densities throughout the
experiment. This suggests that the electroactive community
developed faster and more eﬃciently in reactors inoculated with
HSCE. Remarkably, the maximal current performance reached
during the experiments was almost the same for the three
bioanodesTDWWS1,TDWWS2,andTDWWS3.Areproducible
current production of about 12.5 ±0.2 A/m2was obtained.

TDWWS3, TDWWS1,
and TDWWS2, respectively. Successive
batchesofadditionoftextilewastewaterusuallymakeitpossible
to harmonize the current densities over the long term of
several replicates of experiments. Here, the reproducibility of
the TDWWS replicates observed from the ﬁrst batch is to
be underlined and certainly comes from the inexistence of
competitive reactions due to the inhibition of non-electroactive
microorganismsbythehighsalinity,thetoxicityofthepollutants,
andthepossiblepresenceofoxygentraces.
Previousworkshaveshownthattheperformanceofbioanode
systems is basically inversely proportional to the complexity of
the substrate as in the case of TDWW (Pant et al., 2010; Pandey
et al.,
2016; Heidrich et al., 2018). However, it is worth noting
that
in this study, the oxidation currents obtained are almost
doubled compared with those obtained with the same inoculum
(HSCE) using lactate (5 g/L) as substrate (Askri et al., 2019),
and t
he initial COD for both sets of experiments was 975 and
1,432 mg/l, respectively. The diversity of the TDWWS bioﬁlm
composed jointly of autochthonous and allochthonous bacteria
maybecriticaltoitsperformance.
Overall, wastewater used to feed BES, mainly MECs and
MFCs, was either domestic wastewater or industrial wastewater
from a wide variety of sources (breweries, dairies, reﬁneries).
The highest current densities obtained by BES fed with real
industrial eﬄuents were 10.7 and 10.3 A/m2where bioreﬁnery
(Pannell et al., 2016) and brewery wastewaters (Yu et al.,
2015)
have been used, respectively. However, for BES fed with
domestic
wastewater,thehighestcurrentdensitiesobtainedwere3.8 (Ullery and Logan, 2015) and 3.5 A/m2(Blanchet et al.,
2016).
The average current densities calculated from 48 research
papers
are 2.6 A/m2for industrial wastewater and 0.8 A/m2
for domestic wastewater. Two main reasons could explain in
part this signiﬁcant diﬀerence in average current densities: (i)
industrial wastewater is generally more conductive (7 mS/cm)
thandomesticwastewater(1.5mS/cm)( Yenetal.,2016)and(ii)
the tot
al organic matter concentration in industrial wastewater
is between 5,000 and 12,000 mg/L (Rajeshwari et al., 2000),
wherea
s that in domestic wastewater is between 320 and 740
mg/L(Almeidaetal.,1999).

In sum, the CV results clearly indicate the establishment
of a bioﬁlm with electrocatalytic properties on the carbon
felt electrodes, as well as a successful enrichment of this

COD Measurement
Table1indicates that reactors inoculated with HSCE showed
satisfactory performance in terms of both current production
and COD removal that were about 12.5 ±0.2 A/m2and 91±
3%,respectively.Interestingly,thesereactorsdemonstratedCOD
removal proportional to the production of current generation.
However, COD removal in the reactor not inoculated with
HSCE was much lower, i.e., 42.3%, than those in the inoculated
reactors, and the production of the current also remains very
low. For bioremediation of wastewater containing recalcitrant
pollutants, these ﬁndings revealed that reactors inoculated with
HSCE were found to be comparatively higher in COD removal
eﬃciency than other textile wastewater treatments, such as (i)
anaerobic internal circulation reactor (COD removal =87%),
(ii) Fenton’s process with and without pH adjustment where
COD removal was 89 and 33%, respectively ( Hayat et al., 2015),
and (iii)
the combination of homogenization decantation and
membrane treatments (COD removal =66%) (Buscio et al.,
2015).
Microscopy
Analysis of Bioﬁlms
Morphology
Colonization of the carbon felt electrodes was evaluated at the
end of the experiments, mainly on the outer surface of the felts
but also within the porosity of the felt. Indeed, previous work
has shown the diﬃculty of electroactive bioﬁlms to colonize theinternal surfaces of felt electrode structures (Chong et al., 2019),
especially
when real eﬄuents either viscous, highly charged
with suspended solids, or very highly loaded with COD are
used (Blanchet et al., 2016). Carbon felt WEs possibly covered
with
HSCE and/or TDWW microorganisms were removed
from the reactors and imaged by epiﬂuorescence microscopy
(Figure3). Samples of carbon felt WEs were TDWW that is a
bioanode with very low current production (300 mA/m2) and
TDWWS1, TDWWS2, and TDWWS3 that produced similar
currentdensitiesof12.5 ±0.2A/m2.
TDWW was the electrode sample with the lowest surface
colonization rate. Only a few ﬁbers on the surface of the
carbon felt electrode were partially colonized by scattered, non-
continuous,sparsegroupsofbacterialcolonieswithlowbacterial
cell density. Since this bioanode generated almost no current,
it is not surprising to observe a low rate of colonization. The
few isolated clusters of bacterial colonies are probably mostly
similar to suspended biological substances, kinds of microbial
ﬂocsparticipatinginthenon-bioelectrochemicaloxidationofthe
CODoftextileeﬄuents.
In comparison, the electrode surfaces of TDWWS1,
TDWWS2, and TDWWS3 were much more thickly colonized.
In spite of relatively similar bioelectrochemical behaviors, but
with a time lag, the microscopic patterns of the bioﬁlms show
signiﬁcantdiﬀerences.TDWWS1wascolonizedbyacontinuous
bioﬁlm settled between the surface ﬁbers. The production of
exopolymericsubstanceswasalsomuchmoreprominentforthis
bioﬁlm. TDWWS2 showed a non-homogeneous colonization
of the carbon ﬁbers. The appearance of the bioﬁlm was like
the control not inoculated with sediment from HSCE, but the
density and number of microbial clusters were much higher.
Finally, TDWWS3 showed an intermediate colonization proﬁle
between TDWWS1 and TDWWS2, with a thin continuous
bioﬁlm that closely covered the surface ﬁbers of the carbon felt.
This type of electroactive bioﬁlm enveloping the carbon ﬁbers
is generally a feature of bioﬁlms in hypersaline environments
(Rousseau et al., 2014). However, we have also recently revealed
that
the physical structure of electroactive bioﬁlms formed from
sediments from HSCE, i.e., enveloping the ﬁbers or distributed
between the ﬁbers, was not systematically a sign of improved
or, on the contrary, decreased current production ( Askri et al.,
2019).
Microscopic
inspection of the internal porosity of the carbon
felt electrodes revealed a very low degree of internal porosity
colonization for the electrodes TDWWS1, TDWWS2, and
TDWWS3 (Figure4). Even so, no trace of bioﬁlm could be
seen in the core of the TDWW electrode belonging to the
electrochemical reactor not inoculated with HSCE. The poor
accessibility to the porosity of the carbon felt is usually due to
the clogging phenomena of the external pores of the electrode
exerted by particles in suspension present in the wastewater
(Blanchetetal.,2016).Insofarastheexternalfacesofthecarbon
felts do
not present a colonization obstructing the pores, i.e., the
inter-ﬁber spaces, this hypothesis is not at all conceivable here.

seven
times higher than that in rTDWW (12.5%). In addition
to Proteobacteria, the HSCE sample was hosted by other
low-grade phyla, such as Firmicutes (6.8%), Cyanobacteria
(5%), and Bacteroidetes (2%). Earlier studies using diﬀerent
molecular methods (Ben Abdallah et al., 2016, 2018) have
demonstrated t
hat the bacterial community in HSCE was
dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Based on
the species assignment results (Figure5B), Dysgonomonas
gadeiandFilimana aquilariae were the two dominant
species in rTDWW, wherein their relative abundances
were 21 and 19%, respectively. From the detected phyla
Actinobacteria, Micrococcus sp. andRhodococcus sp. were the
most representative species at relative abundances of 12.6 and
11.5%, respectively. However, the Proteobacteria phylum shows
a bacterial proﬁle with the enrichment of Pseudomonas sp.
(12.5%),Comamonas acidovorans (12%),Lysobacter sp. (11%),
Aeromonas hydrophila (10.2%),Burkholderia cepacia (9%), and
Achromobacter sp. (8.5%). By contrast, sample coming from
HSCE was represented by various species of Proteobacteria
with a predominance of Psychrobacter aquaticus (14.5%),
Marinobacter sediminum (13.5%), Psychrobacter alimentarius
(12.5%), Geobacter sulfurreducens (9.5%), Marinobacter
hydrocarbonoclasticus (9%),Geobactermetallireducens (9%),and
Halomonas spp.(7.5%).
Figure5B indicates that the relative abundances of bacteria
at phylum level in TDWWS1, TDWWS2, and TDWWS3
bioﬁlms are quite similar, whereas those in TDWW bioﬁlm
show some diﬀerences. TDWWS1, TDWWS2, and TDWWS3

in the three bioﬁlms show heterogeneous proﬁles composed
of phyla found in rTDWW and in HSCE. In this case,
TDWWS1, TDWWS2, and TDWWS3 bioﬁlms harbored
autochthonousphylafromrTDWWrepresentedinparticularby
Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroﬂexi, and Planctomycetes
and allochthonous phyla from HSCE, such as Proteobacteria,
Firmicutes, and Thermotogae. The heterogeneous bacterial
proﬁle of the diﬀerent bioﬁlms occurs more clearly at species
level.P. aquaticus (8.06–16.02%), P. alimentarius (3.04–6.5%),
G. sulfurreducens (8.2–11.8%), G. metallireducens (2.5–5.4%),
M. hydrocarbonoclasticus (6.3–7.4%), and M. sediminum
(2.3–11.7%) as allochthonous species (and not found in
rTDWWsample)werethemostabundantspeciesinTDWWS1,
TDWWS2, and TDWWS3 bioﬁlms. Furthermore, B. cepacia
(2.4–7.6%), Achromobacter sp. (10.1–16.4%), C. acidovorans
(8.4–14.2), D. gadei (2.6–15.0%), Rhodococcus sp. (3.2–9.6%),
andMicrococcus sp. (5.8–15.7%) as autochthonous species
(and not found in HSCE) were also abundant in TDWWS1,
TDWWS2,andTDWWS3bioﬁlms.

By comparing the bacterial community of these three
bioﬁlms to
that hosted TDWW, considered as a control,
we found that TDWW harbored less bacteria belonging to
the Proteobacteria (9.47%) and Bacteroidetes (3.22%) phyla.
However, it hosted more bacteria from the Planctomycetes
(4.5%), Chloroﬂexi (3.6%), and Spirochaeta (1.5%) phyla. At
specieslevel,themostabundantbacteriainTDWWbioﬁlmwere
D. gadei (19.04%), Pseudomonas sp. (16.66%), Achromobacter
sp. (15.47%), F. aquilariae (14.28%), and Lysobacter sp. (8.33%).
Thisbioﬁlm(TDWW)composedonlyofautochthonousbacteria
was not electrochemically eﬀective, as shown in Figure1.
Only few hundred milliamperes were obtained as current
generation (300mA). These strains were also noticed in
previous studies on microbial communities in textile wastewater
(Meerbergenetal.,2016).
Strikingly, hig
h current production was obtained (12.5 ±0.2
A/m2) with bioﬁlms (TDWWS1, TDWWS2, and TDWWS3)
incorporated by both bacteria from HSCE and TDWW
samples. A core bacterial community that was shared by
the three bioﬁlms could be highly involved in the current
production. This core was composed of three autochthonous
strains,Achromobacter sp.,C. acidovorans, D. gadei, and
four allochthonous strains, P. aquaticus, G. sulfurreducens, G.
metallireducens,and M.sediminum.
CONCLUSION
This work is the ﬁrst to demonstrate the potential to develop a
novelhalothermotolerantbioanodeincorporatingallochthonous
and autochthonous bacteria from both hypersaline sediment
and TDWW. A core bacterial community composed of three
autochthonous strains, Achromobacter sp.,C. acidovorans,
D. gadei, and four allochthonous strains, P. aquaticus, G.
sulfurreducens, G. metallireducens, and M. sediminum, ensures
the eﬀectiveness of the bioanode by producing high currentdensity (12.5 A/m2) and a total of 91% of COD removal
eﬃciency. These ﬁndings, achieved under both hypersaline
(165 g/L) and thermophilic conditions (45◦), could lead to
possibleapplicationsofBEStechnologyfortreatmentandenergy
recoveringfromhigh-temperatureandhigh-salinewastewaters.

From the ships engine rooms a recalcitrant wastewater is produced called “bilge” which
contains oil, metal working ﬂuids, surfactants, and salinity. This study investigated the
treatment of real bilge wastewater in short experiments using the following processes:
(i) anaerobic digestion with granular sludge and ZVI addition for enhancement of
methane production, (ii) activated charcoal addition to biological treatment (aerobic
and anaerobic) for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) signiﬁcant reduction and (iii)
combination of ZVI and anaerobic charcoal addition for high performance treatment. The
addition of ZVI in anaerobic sludge resulted in higher performance mostly in cumulative
CH4production. The microbial proﬁle of anaerobic granular sludge exposed to ZVI
was determined and Acetobacterium andArcobacter were the most dominant bacteria
genera. Activated charcoal achieved higher COD removal, compared to biological
degradation (aerobic and anaerobic). The combination of the two mechanisms,
activated charcoal and biomass, had higher COD removal only for aerobic biomass.
The combination of ZVI and activated charcoal to anaerobic digestion resulted in higher
CH4production and signiﬁcant COD removal in short contact time.
Keywords: bilge wastewater, anaerobic granular sludge, activated charcoal, methane, Acetobacterium,
aerobic biomass
INTRODUCTION
Bilge wastewater is generated in the ships engine room and is stored in the lowest part of the ship
called bilge tank (Uma and Gandhimathi, 2019). Bilge is a recalcitrant wastewater that contains
diesel oil, soluble oil, metal working ﬂuids, surfactants and has high salinity (15–30 g L 1).
McLaughlin et al. (2014) reported that bilge wastewater contains hydrocarbons such as toluene,
benzene, butylbenzene, ethylbenzene, acenaphthene, phenanthrene, pyrene, ﬂuorene, metals, and
substantial concentrations of detergents and solvents. The high concentration of surfactants
causes the solubilization of high concentration of oil compounds in bilge wastewater and this
contributes to high chemical oxygen demand (COD) (Vyrides et al., 2018b). In addition, according
to International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations (MARPOL 73/78) and the European
directive 2000/59/EC bilge wastewater cannot be discharged to environment and should be properly
treated enroute or to be deposited at reception facilities on land (Julian, 2000; Vyrides et al.,

coagulation, chemical oxidation, membrane ﬁltration and others,
as well as biological treatment methods (Varjani et al., 2020).
Up to date several studies examined the biological treatment
of bilge wastewater using aerobic mix consortia. Speciﬁcally,
Vyrides et al. (2018b) found approximately 60% Chemical
Oxygen Demand (COD) removal from real bilge wastewater in
a pilot (200 L) Moving Bed Bioﬁlm Reactor (MBBR) system.
Nisenbaum et al. (2020) used an enriched aerobic microbial
consortium to treat bilge wastewater and found 66.65, 72.33, and
97.76% removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons, aromatics and
n-alkanes, respectively. Hwang et al. (2019) used single chamber
microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for bilge wastewater biodegradation
and concurrent electricity generation. In this system, the COD
removal was greatly increased with the addition of anionic
surfactant (SDS).
Regarding the anaerobic treatment of bilge water, Emadian
et al. (2015) reported 75% COD removal of low strength bilge
water whereas Vyrides et al. (2018b) in a batch test pointed out
28% of COD removal from real bilge wastewater. As a strategy
to treat recalcitrant wastewater and enhance methane production
several studies examined chemicals addition to the process.
A recent study examined CaO 2pretreatment of waste activaded
sludge in order to degrade refractory compounds such as humus
and lignocelluloses, increasing importantly methane production
during anaerobic digestion (Wang et al., 2019). Other researchers
added zero valent iron directly in the anaerobic digestion process;
Liu et al. (2011) for dye wastewater, Wang et al. (2017) for
Fischer-Tropsch (FT) wastewater, Xu et al. (2020) for coking
wastewater and Pan et al. (2019) for tetracycline biodegradation.
The addition of ZVI in the anaerobic digestion results in the
abiotic H 2production due to anaerobic oxidation of ZVI. The
generated H 2is utilized by hydrogenotrophic methanogens along
with CO 2and therefore increase CH 4in the system. In addition
the ZVI anaerobic oxidation provides alkalinity in the system and
due to the enhancement of hydrogen utilizing microorganisms
can contribute to propionic acid utilization.
Regarding adsorption method so far only Vlaev et al. (2011)
investigated the bilge wastewater adsorption using sing rice husks
ash. The results showed that rice husks ash had high adsorption
capacity for hydrocarbon removal for bilge water. In addition,
the ﬁnal product was characterized with high caloriﬁc value and
was proposed to be used as a feedstock in incinerators, industrial
ovens or steam generators.
The aim of this study was to improve biological treatment of
bilge wastewater using advanced processes. Biological treatment
was chosen as a relatively inexpensive and easy to apply method.
For this reason the following conditions were examined under
batch mode experimental set up and at small laboratory scale.
(A) Firstly, anaerobic digestion of bilge wastewater was
examined as an initial biological treatment step for
decreasing high organic load and the addition of ZVI was
evaluated as a strategy to increase methane production. The
microbial proﬁle under these conditions was studied using
next generation sequencing.
(B) Secondly, a puriﬁcation step was tested, combining
activated charcoal adsorption and biological activity.Both aerobic and anaerobic conditions were tested in
this case in order to determine the more eﬃcient for
organic load decrease.
(C) Finally, both treatment steps were combined in
order to evaluate treatment performance and reduce
treatment time. In this case anaerobic digestion was
examined with the simultaneous addition of (i) ZVI; for
methane enhancement, and (ii) activated charcoal; for
organic load decrease.
To the author’s knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study examining
ZVI addition for enhancement of real bilge wastewater anaerobic
treatment, and the ﬁrst to combine this approach with activated
charcoal as a second individual treatment step or as a
combination of processes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Anaerobic Digestion of Bilge Wastewater
For all anaerobic experiments, sealed glass serum bottles were
used and were incubated at 37C. Anaerobic granular sludge was
used at a concentration of 4% w/v, collected from a mesophilic
upﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASB) that was treating
dairy wastewater (Charalambides Christis Ltd, Limassol, Cyprus),
operated at pH 6.8–7.3 (as reported by Samanides et al., 2020).
Raw bilge wastewater was used, collected by a company treating
this wastewater type (Ecofuel Ltd, Zygi, Cyprus), the wastewater
characteristics are described in detail in a previous study by
Vyrides et al. (2018b). A mineral medium as described by
Angelidaki et al. (2009) was added to create the same initial
concentration in all experiments. Raw bilge wastewater was
enriched with the following stock solutions (chemicals given are
concentrations in g L 1in distilled water) Solution A: NH 4Cl,
100; NaCl, 10; MgCl 26H2O, 10; CaCl 22H2O, 5, Solution B:
K2HPO 43H2O, 200. To 993 ml of raw bilge wastewater the
following volume of each stock solution was added: (Solution
A) 5 ml, (Solution B) 2 ml as well as 3 g of NaHCO 3. As
a last step, prior to incubation, the serum bottles were sealed
with rubber septa and a screw cap and the headspace was
ﬂushed with CO 2(99.99% purity) for 1 min for the creation of
anaerobic conditions.
Preliminary investigation included the test of three dilution
rates for the treatment of bilge wastewater of low initial COD
with anaerobic digestion. The following dilution factors were
applied to the wastewater: 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4, leading to wastewater
concentration of 100, 50, and 25% in each case. Serum bottles of
125 ml were used with a working volume of 70 ml. Treatment
time was 82 days.
Monitoring of the anaerobic digestion process included
the determination of biogas volume production as well
as gas composition of the headspace. For this reason a
gas chromatograph, coupled with a thermal conductivity
detector (GC-TCD, Agilent technologies 7820A GC system,
Wilmington, DE) was used, according to the method described
by Vyrides et al. (2018b). Furthermore, the Chemical Oxygen
Demand (COD) value of the wastewater was measured at

the beginning, during and at the end of the experiments.
For COD quantiﬁcation a modiﬁed colorimetric method
was used (absorbance quantiﬁcation with HACH, DR1900
spectrophotometer), according to Freire and Sant’Anna (1998)
and Vyrides and Stuckey (2009) in order to take into
consideration the oxidation of chloride ions present in bilge
wastewater due to high salinity.
ZVI Batch Experiments
For the examination of more realistic industrial conditions, the
enhancement of anaerobic digestion of high organic load bilge
wastewater with the use of Zero-Valent-Iron (ZVI) was tested
as a technique to facilitate microbial activity via H 2production.
Powder ZVI (Merck, Iron for analysis reduced, particle size
10mm, CAS-No: 7439-89-6) was used at two concentration
levels (10, 25 g L 1) in a small scale batch experiment (125 ml
glass serum bottles with 70 ml working volume) and in a
second experimental cycle the periodic addition of ZVI was
tested under semi batch conditions in a larger scale experiment
(500 ml glass bottles with 300 ml working volume). Bilge
wastewater, granular anaerobic sludge and anaerobic conditions
were obtained and handled as described in section “Anaerobic
Digestion of Bilge Wastewater.” COD and gas composition were
monitored over time in order to evaluate digestion performance.
The microbial proﬁle (bacteria and archea) of the granular
sludge was evaluated after 47 days of operation under semi
batch conditions (larger scale experiment). Approximately 180–
220 mg of biomass were collected from each bioreactor. Then the
total genomic DNA was extracted through the NucleoSpin DNA
stool (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) and was sent to DNASense
Company (Denmark) for sequencing.
Activated Charcoal Batch Experiments
Activated charcoal was tested conjointly with microorganisms for
further reduction of organic load in bilge wastewater. Aerobic
and anaerobic experiments were conducted with medium initial
COD level and under batch mode in sealed glass serum bottles
(125 ml) with 70 ml working volume and 55 ml of headspace.
Activated charcoal (AC) (Fluka, CAS-No: 7440-44-0) was used at
the concentration level of 3 g L 1whereas optimum performance
was observed after preliminary experiments.
For anaerobic treatment, the set up of the experiments
was conducted as described in section “Anaerobic Digestion
of Bilge Wastewater.” For aerobic treatment, a liquid mixed
bacteria culture, obtained by enrichment steps (3 months), was
used with the addition of 4% v/v in the serum bottle. For
the examination of aerobic treatment performance, COD was
monitored and UV-VIS spectra of the eﬄuent was examined
using a benchtop spectrophotometer (Jenway 7315 UV/Visible
spectrophotometer).
Combined ZVI and Activated Charcoal
Batch Experiment
The combination of the techniques described in section “ZVI
Batch Experiments” and section “Activated Charcoal Batch
Experiments” were applied in order to test the parallel reductionof high organic load in combination with high CH 4production.
Sealed glass serum bottles (125 ml) with 70 ml working volume
and 55 ml of headspace were used and anaerobic granular sludge
was added at a concentration of 4% w/v. Anaerobic digestion
of bilge wastewater of high initial COD was examined (i) with
granular sludge and with (ii) granular sludge with ZVI (10 g L 1)
and activated charcoal (3 g L 1) addition at the beginning of the
experiment. Samples were created in triplicates and monitored
over 15 days, as described in section “Anaerobic Digestion of
Bilge Wastewater.”
RESULTS
Treatment of Bilge Wastewater Using
Anaerobic Granular Sludge With and
Without Zero Valent Iron Addition
Figure 1A points out that the exposure of anaerobic granular
sludge to undiluted real bilge wastewater (initial COD 2200 mg
L 1) resulted in relatively low methane production over a period
of 82 days. The dilution of the wastewater caused higher methane
production, probably as a result of toxicity decrease. The COD
removal after 82 days varied from 50 to 60% under these low
initial COD conditions.
As a strategy to alleviate bilge inhibition to anaerobic granular
sludge, zero valent iron was added at 10 and 25 g ZVI L 1. As
shown in Figure 1B, addition of ZVI generated higher amount
of CH 4compared to anaerobic granular sludge without ZVI.
The COD removal under these conditions was low (Figure 1B),
however, the COD removal in the reactors containing ZVI was
slightly higher compared to the reactors with anaerobic granular
sludge free of ZVI. Noteworthy, the initial COD was 5150 mg L 1
which was more than double than the experiment related with
Figure 1A . It is likely that the higher COD in the experiment
related with Figure 1B has contributed to higher toxicity to
anaerobic granular sludge and therefore the anaerobic granular
sludge (with no ZVI) resulted in negligible COD removal. Part of
the higher CH 4composition (Figure 1B) in anaerobic granular
sludge with ZVI could be due to H 2production due to anaerobic
aquatic zero valent iron oxidation followed by the H 2and CO 2
utilization by hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Vyrides et al.,
2018a; Menikea et al., 2020).
Based on the positive ﬁndings regarding the ZVI addition a
larger scale (500 ml glass bottles with 300 ml working volume)
experiment took place as descripted in section “Materials and
Methods.” As shown at Table 1, at the beginning of the
experiment the anaerobic granular sludge with 10 g L 1ZVI
resulted in dramatically higher methane production (55.5 ml CH 4
at day 7) compared to anaerobic granular sludge free of ZVI
(8.5 ml CH 4at day 7). This trend was continued through the
experiment and higher performance was found for the bioreactor
with 10 g L 1, followed by the bioreactor with 2 g L 1initial ZVI
concentration (were ZVI 2 g L 1was periodically added). The
lower performance was found in the anaerobic granular sludge
free of ZVI (Table 1). This diﬀerence was also more profound in
the CH 4composition under these conditions.

Mazioti et al. Processes for Bilge Wastewater Treatment
FIGURE 1 | Performance of anaerobic digestion of bilge wastewater with the use of granular sludge (A)under different dilution factors (100, 50, and 25%
concentration of bilge) and low initial COD (2200, 1100, and 550 mg L 1) and (B)with the addition of powder ZVI (25, 10, and 0 g L 1) and with a high initial COD
(5150 mg L 1).
The relative abundance of the archaeal 16S rRNA gene
at the genus levels is shown in Figure 2A. Samples were
withdrawn from bioreactors on day 47. The most dominant
genus in anaerobic sludge with ZVI were Acetobacterium and
Arcobacter. However, these genera were negligible in anaerobic
granular sludge without ZVI (Figure 2A). Acetobacterium are
homoacetogens and can convert H 2and CO 2to acetic acid;
they were stimulated due to the presence of ZVI and the release
of H 2(Menikea et al., 2020). The Arcobacter genus includes a
diverse assemblage of species which are obligate and facultative
chemolithoautotrophs as well as heterotrophs. Arcobacter spp.
have been enriched in engineered systems containing high levels
of sulﬁde and high levels of organic matter and beneﬁt from the
transfer of organic matter and hydrogen (Callbeck et al., 2019).
Methanosaeta sp. (acetoclastic methanogens) have been
proposed as one of the primary microbial groups responsible
for methanogenic granule formation and this explains its high
abundance in all samples; however, a higher relative abundance
was found in anaerobic granular sludge that was exposedto 10 g L 1of ZVI (Figure 2). These ﬁndings are in line
with the study of Vyrides et al. (2018a) which found higher
relative abundance in anaerobic granular sludge exposed to
ZVI. Methanolinea, a hydrogenotrophic methanogen, was the
dominant genus (50%) in the anaerobic granular sludge where
2 g ZVI L 1was periodically added in the bioreactor (Table 1
and Figure 2B). Finally, another hydrogenotrophic methanogen,
Methanobacterium, was found at a higher relative abundance in
anaerobic granular sludge exposed to ZVI compare to anaerobic
granular sludge free of ZVI (Figure 2B).
Activated Charcoal
As observed in preliminary and ZVI anaerobic experiments, the
COD removal from bilge wastewater was relatively low, requiring
considerable amount of time, probably due to the toxicity of the
wastewater toward anaerobic granular sludge. As a strategy to
overcome this, the treatment of bilge wastewater in a system of
activated charcoal and anaerobic granular sludge was examined.
At an initial COD level of 2750 mg L 1, with the presence of

activated charcoal in the anaerobic granular sludge reactor, 52
and 60% COD removal rates were achieved after 3 and 63 days
of exposure, respectively. Under the same conditions, activated
charcoal without anaerobic granular sludge, removed 48 and 84%
of the COD load (after 3 and 63 days, respectively). The lower
COD removal observed after 63 days of treatment when both
activated charcoal and granular sludge were present could be
attributed to the decrease of sorption capacity because of VFAs
production and adsorption onto activated charcoal after the ﬁrst
days of anaerobic digestion. This trend was observed in a similar
study by Jiang et al. (2021) where VFAs where monitored and
found to be of lower concentration when activated carbon was
present in the anaerobic digestion process. Anaerobic granular
sludge without addition of activated charcoal pointed out low
COD removal on day 3 and then the removal increased to 62%
on day 63. The methane production of anaerobic granular sludge
during bilge treatment with and without activated charcoal was
similar (Figure 3B). It is highly probable that in the system of
anaerobic granular sludge where activated charcoal is present,
COD is removed through adsorption on activated charcoal
during the ﬁrst days of treatment and then part of the organics
are biodegraded by anaerobic granular sludge (Figure 3A).
A similar experiment was conducted testing the addition
of activated charcoal under aerobic conditions and with the
addition of an aerobic mixed culture instead of anaerobic
granular sludge (Figure 3C). After 3 days of treatment,
the COD removal (initial COD: 3470 mg L 1) achieved
by aerobic biomass with activated charcoal and activated
charcoal exclusively was 59 and 61%, respectively. The COD
removal slightly increased over time, reaching 62 and 65%
removal after 90 days of treatment (for aerobic biomass with
activated charcoal and activated charcoal, respectively) On the
other hand, aerobic biomass without any activated charcoal
pointed out the lower COD removal (19% on day 3 and33% on day 90). It is highly probable that the contribution
of biomass is not signiﬁcant due to the rapid adsorption
of easily biodegradable compounds (low molecular weight
organic compounds) on activated charcoal, creating a hostile
environment for microorganisms whereas, compounds hard
to biodegrade are left in the liquid phase increasing toxicity.
The UV-VIS spectra of treated eﬄuent (after 90 days of
treatment) revealed the signiﬁcant impact of activated charcoal
addition (Figure 3D). The compounds detected at around
290 nm were substantially removed in the reactors containing
activated charcoal and remained present in the reactors free of
activated charcoal.
Effect of ZVI and Activated Charcoal
Combined Addition
The performance of anaerobic digestion of bilge wastewater
with granular sludge was evaluated over the same process
with the addition of ZVI and activated charcoal. The addition
of both compounds simultaneously had a positive eﬀect on
the treatment performance. Over 15 days of treatment the
conventional anaerobic digestion reduced less than 5% of the
initial COD of the wastewater while only 2.5 0.1 ml of CH 4
were produced. On the other hand, with the addition of ZVI
and activated charcoal almost 50% of initial COD was reduced
in 15 days, while the CH 4production reached 44.3 3.4 ml
and the CH 4percentage in the biogas reached 76.3 2.5% (see
Supplementary Material).
DISCUSSION
The treatment of real bilge wastewater with a high variability
in the organic content was examined in short experiments

addition, (ii) biological treatment (aerobic and anaerobic) with
activated charcoal addition, and (iii) combination of ZVI and
activated charcoal addition in anaerobic digestion. It was found
that undiluted bilge wastewater (initial COD 2200 mg COD
L 1) showed little cumulative CH 4production whereas dilution
leading to 50 and 25% concentration of the wastewater resulted
in higher cumulative CH 4. Under these conditions the COD
removal was between 50 to 60% after 82 days of treatment. In
another experiment where the initial COD was 5150 mg L 1
anaerobic granular sludge removed negligible percentage of COD
and this showed that the higher the initial COD the harder for the
microorganisms to eﬃciently degrade the wastewater, probably
due to higher toxicity toward anaerobic granular sludge. At initial
COD 5150 mg L 1the anaerobic granular sludge with ZVI
pointed out higher performance even though the diﬀerence with
anaerobic granular sludge without ZVI was more profound in
CH 4than in the COD removal. The higher CH 4could be due
to abiotic anaerobic ZVI oxidation and the released H 2that was
then utilized by hydrogenotrophic microorganisms. The higher
performance of anaerobic granular sludge with ZVI was also
found at a larger scale experiment (500 ml glass bottles with
300 ml working volume) whereas anaerobic granular sludge with
ZVI 10 g L 1resulted in the highest performance followed byanaerobic granular sludge where ZVI 2 g L 1was periodically
added. As previously described (section “Treatment of Bilge
Wastewater Using Anaerobic Granular Sludge With and Without
Zero Valent Iron Addition”), the H 2produced is probably the
main mechanism increasing the methane production. Regarding
the two addition methods tested (10 g L 1initial addition or
progressively addition of 2 g L 1each time) it seems that with
a low concentration periodical addition of ZVI, H 2is released at
a lower rate, rendering the process less eﬀective (Vyrides et al.,
2018a). The lowest performance was identiﬁed for anaerobic
granular sludge without any addition of ZVI in terms of total
CH 4production and CH 4concentration in biogas composition.
The bacteria at genus level with the higher relative abundance
in anaerobic granular sludge with ZVI were Acetobacterium and
Arcobacter, which can utilize H 2along with CO 2or organic
matter (Callbeck et al., 2019). Methanosaeta sp. (acetoclastic
methanogens) found in high abundance in all anaerobic granules
probably due to its role in granule formation. On the other
hand, Methanobacterium (hydrogenotrophic methanogen), was
found at a higher relative abundance in anaerobic granular
sludge exposed to ZVI compare to anaerobic granular sludge
free of ZVI most likely due to the presence of H 2due to
anaerobic ZVI oxidation.

Mazioti et al. Processes for Bilge Wastewater Treatment
The addition of activated charcoal in anaerobic granular
sludge resulted in fast COD removal after 3 days, however, the
COD removal has slightly increased over time. Interestingly, the
cumulative CH 4was the same for both conditions (anaerobic
sludge with activated charcoal and without) and this indicate
that activate charcoal contributes mostly by organics adsorption
and has not enhanced further the organic biodegradation by
anaerobic granular sludge. The same trend was also found
for aerobic biomass with activated charcoal which shows
approximately 60% COD removal after 3 days whereas aerobic
biomass only resulted in 19% COD removal during the
same contact time.
These results point out that for rapid COD removal a
physicochemical process (activated charcoal) is needed and that
the biological process (anaerobic and aerobic) is slow due to
toxicity of bilge toward biomass and/or due to recalcitrant
organics compounds in bilge wastewater. The integration of
activated charcoal in biomass (aerobic or anaerobic) resulted
in high COD removal in the ﬁrst days and then the COD
removal was stabilize; however, more research can be done to
examine its eﬀect over longer time period. It is probable that the
adsorption capacity of activated charcoal is high at the beginning
of the treatment, leading to fast COD deterioration, but as
activated charcoal reaches saturation the removal rate gets stable
(Jiang et al., 2021).
The combination of ZVI and activated charcoal addition
had a positive eﬀect on the anaerobic digestion process.
Both COD decrease and CH 4production were achieved at a
relatively low contact time. Further research could focus on
the underlying mechanisms of this treatment scheme, while
larger scale experiments could determine the feasibility of the
method application.
To summarize, greater bioremediation performance, in terms
of COD removal, was observed when activated charcoal was
added to the biological process. Additionally, the amount and
quality of biogas produced during the anaerobic digestion
of bilge wastewater can be increased via ZVI addition to
the wastewater. The independent use of the two techniques
could be used for eﬃcient treatment but would increase
treatment time. The combination of both approaches providedpromising results and with further investigation could lead to an
applicable method.

highly toxic and can persist in soil for up to 2 years according to its degradation half-life.
Hence, its residual effect is highly hazardous for the environment and local habitants
via leaching, surface runoff. Screening out of species of green manure as potential
phytoremediators for tebuthiuron in soil, with and with no vinasse, accordingly is the
scientiﬁc point of this study. Green manure species selected for the trial in greenhouse
were jack bean [Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC.], pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan (L. Millsp.)],
velvet bean [Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC.)], and millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.], and
Crotalariajuncea L. as bioindicator of this herbicide. The determination/quantiﬁcation of
height, stem diameter, and number of leaves in all plants were monitored, as well as
other morphological traits for drafting any inference on biomass production. Moreover,
ecotoxicity bioassays were performed from soil samples at the beginning and at the end
of the experiment. Results showed preliminary evidence of effective phytoremediation
capacity by M. pruriens andP. glaucum in soils with tebuthiuron, as the growth of
C. juncea was sustained. Both Gompertz approach and principal component analysis
predictedthatthesegreenmanurespeciescouldgrowhealthierandforlongerperiodsin

ecotoxicity. The implications of this study may aid in the implementation of cost-effective
strategies targeting decontamination of tebuthiuron in sugarcane crops with vinasse
application in fertigation.

INTRODUCTION
Sugarcane is aﬀected by weeds, despite its highly eﬃcient photosynthetic pathway (C 4) that
promotes adequate development, especially in its early stages. Weeds compete for available soil
resources and therefore undermine agricultural yields ( Victoria Filho and Christoﬀoleti, 2004;
Sandaniel
etal.,2008).
85Ferreira et al. Phytorem ediation of Tebuthiuron and Vinasse
The planting of sugarcane takes place in wide open areas so
that
high productivity is achieved, aided by technological tools
for the proper weed management as herbicides (Kuva et al.,
2008; Oliveira
and Brighenti, 2011). Such chemical method is
theﬁr
stchoiceofagriculturalproducersduetoitseaseofaccess,
availability,andlowoperationalcosts,comparedtoothercontrol
techniques( Kuvaetal.,2008).
Among t
he herbicides commercialized for sugarcane,
tebuthiuron is the most used, whose selective pre-emergent
action controls main weeds in the crop (Moraes et al., 2016).
This mole
cule [1-(5-tert-butyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)-1,3-
dimethylurea] has a systemic action and acts in the inhibition of
photosystem II (Breitenbach et al., 2001). However, tebuthiuron
canc
auseenvironmentaldamagesinceitisconsidereddangerous
to the environment due to its high persistence and long half-life
in the environment, moderate to extreme toxicity (Rodrigues
andAlmeid
a,2011),lowsortingcapacityinsoil(Koskinenetal.,
1996),
and high solubility in water (Franco-Bernardes et al.,
2014).
Hence, residual concentration is an extremely important
factor
, as it results in a greater potential for contamination.
Therefore, successive applications without proper management
can make its potential for impact even greater on soil and
groundwater(Christofolettietal.,2017).
Vinas
se can also be applied to farmlands as growth-inducing
agents, as opposed to herbicides. Vinasse is one of the many by-
products of sugar production also found in alcohol distilleries
in enormous quantities. It is highly applicable as fertilizer
during crop production (Andrade, 2007). It is considered a
residue
from the alcohol production, generated at a 10–14:1
ratio (Assad, 2017). The outstandingly large amount of vinasse
generated e
veryday highlights its expressive polluting potential
and, therefore, demands the development of proper disposal
protocols. However, vinasse can also be used to enrich soils due
to its nutritional value. Still, its environmental eﬀects combined
withherbicidesareyettobedetermined.
The cleaning up process of areas with previous pesticides
release is not simple, but fortunately, many solutions have
been improved in the past decades. Feasible solutions should
follow four requirements, as proposed by Ferro et al. (1994): (i)
high
decontamination eﬃciency, (ii) straightforward execution,
(iii) fast and reliable protocols, and (iv) cost eﬀectiveness.
Bioremediation is as an ecologically viable strategy that meets
such requirements during the treatment of impacted areas
by organic pollutants. The acceleration of natural biological
processes that reduce the concentration and toxic eﬀects of
polluting agents is the core of all bioremediation strategies
(FasanellaandCardoso,2016).
Phytoremediation furt
her expands this deﬁnition by using
plantstoreducethetoxicityofcontaminantsintheenvironment
(Ali et al., 2013). Research related to this technique seeks to
underst
and the plant–contaminant interactions that may lead to
full pollutant removal (Vasconcellos et al., 2012). Therefore, the
plants must
be capable of absorbing toxic elements in the soil to
promotedecontamination(Souzaetal.,2011).
Piresetal.(2008) reportedthatmillet(Pennise tum typhoides),
velvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum), Jack bean (Canavalia
ensiformis), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) were highlyeﬀective toward tebuthiuron phytoremediation. They used sunn
hemp (Crotalarea juncea) as the bioindicator plant. Several
studies reinforce this approach, as many authors have observed
a decrease in pesticides concentration in soils by using
phytoremediation( Piresetal.,2003,2005,2006; Piresetal.,2008;
Madalão
etal.,2013;Meloetal.,2017).
However
, there is a major drawback in all those studies: the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experiments were set up in a greenhouse located at the
College of Agricultural and Technological Sciences, Sao Paulo
State University (Unesp), Dracena, São Paulo, Brazil, with
geographical coordinates of 21◦28′57′′S 51◦31′58′′W and
400melevation.
According to the Köppen (1948) classiﬁcation, the regional
climate type
is Aw (tropical humid). The average local
temperature and precipitation are 22.1◦C and 1,200mm,
respectively. The meteorological data were provided by our own
station(DracenaEMA/FCAT).
The observations occurred between May and July 2019. The
average temperature and relative humidity were 22.6◦C and
62.9%,respectively,alsoobtainedfromtheDracenaEMA/FCAT

for ﬁlling the pot total volume. The volume of each vessel was
4dm3.
The vinasse was collected from a sugar-energy plant in the
Dracena-SP region using sterile glass bottles. The vinasse was
subsequently stored in a refrigerator at 4◦C until its use in the
experimentalunitspreparation(storedfor3days).
The herbicide tebuthiuron was provided by CombineR/circlecopyrt
500SC—DowAgroSciencesIndustrialLtd.
Plant Species
The plant species were chosen according to their capability to
remediate pesticide-contaminated soils. Their agricultural
potential to improve overall soil quality was another
criterion. We narrowed our plants selection to species
that are often found as green manure and/or forage in
the rotation of the sugarcane cultures. Thus, we used the
following species: pigeon pea (C. cajan), jack bean (C.
ensiformis) (Madalão et al., 2013, 2016), velvet bean (M.
pruriens
) (Pires et al., 2005, 2008), and millet (P. glaucum )
(Piresetal.,2008).
Experimental Setup
We
designed the experiments according to a randomized blocks
approachata2 ×2×4factorialschemewithﬁverepetitions.The
parametersweretebuthiuronconcentration,vinassevolume,and
thefourplantspecies.
The treatments are further referred to in this paper as
indicated in the brackets: [T–], absence of tebuthiuron; [T+],
presence of tebuthiuron; [V–], absence of vinasse; and [V+]
presenceofvinasse.Preparation of Experimental Units
Experimental units (pots 4 dm3and their contents) were ﬁlled
with soil and received the four potentially phytoremediating
species. Treatments containing vinasse had to undergo manual
compound application to endure homogeneity. The vinasse was
addedﬁrst,at150m3ha−1(150mldm−3),followingtheCETESB
Technical Standard P4.231/2005 (2005) on the procedures to
applyvinassetoagriculturalsoils.
The CombineR/circlecopyrt500 SC was sprayed at the following day,
at 2L ha−1as the recommended rate of this herbicide in
sugarcane crops, using a CO 2pressurized sprayer (HerbicatR/circlecopyrt)
equipped with six XR 8002 ﬂat jet nozzles at a pressure of
2 bar (0.65L min−1ﬂowrate) from a minimum distance of
0.5m. The application was carried out 0.75m above the pots
at a constant speed (5km h−1) until 250L ha−1had been
applied. Environmental conditions such as temperature and
relative humidity were monitored at the time of spraying
using a portable digital thermo-hygro-anemometer-luximeter
(InstruthermR/circlecopyrtmodel THAL-300). The spraying occurred
inside our greenhouse to avoid wind interference during the
application.Anequivalentvolumeofdeionizedwaterwasadded
totreatmentswithoutvinasseand/ortebuthiuron.
Finally, 10 seeds per pot were sown the day after the
tebuthiuron application. Thinning was performed on the eight
DAS to keep only one plant per pot. These were irrigated daily
bymicrosprinklersfor60min(30minat6:00a.m.and30minat

Thinning was performed on the 10th DAS. These were also
irrigated
daily by microsprinkling at 6 mm/h for 60min (30min
at 6:00 A.M. and 30min at 6:00 P.M.) to sustain proper plant
developmentconditions.
Evaluation of Plant Growth
Plant growth was quantiﬁed weekly. The monitored parameters
were (i) stem diameter in millimeter, (ii) height of shoot in
centimeter,and(iii)numberofleaves.
ForC. cajan, C. ensiformis, M. pruriens, and P.
glaucum, the periodic monitoring running from the 15th
to the 50th DAS yielded six time-point datasets until
the end (t 50) of cultivation. C. juncea was planted in all
experimental units, and its morphological parameters
were monitored from 17th to the 45th DAS, thus
yielding ﬁve time-point datasets until the end of
experiment(t 95).
After cultivation, plants were separated for quantiﬁcation of
biomass: the fresh and dry matter of shoots and roots. The
separation of the shoots and roots occurred by cutting the
stalks close to the soil between the stem and the root. The
roots were thoroughly washed so that all the soil was removed.
After separation, each fraction was weighed separately and
then packed in a paper bag to dryness in oven at 65◦C, over
72h. The resulting samples were weighted again to obtain the
drymass.Ecotoxicity Bioassays
Bioassays monitored the ecotoxicological potential of
each treatment over the proposed time frame. The
phytotoxicity of the soil samples was determined at the
initial (t 0) and ﬁnal (t 50) times when it was cultivated
the phytoremediation species (C. cajan, C. ensiformis,
M. pruriens, and P. glaucum), just before the C.
junceaintroduction.
Lettuce seeds (Lactuca sativa) were the test organism,
according to Sobrero and Ronco (2004). Phytotoxic eﬀect
determination of
each treatment was performed in six replicates
from the solubilized soil extract, according to the NBR 10.006
(ABNT,2004).
Ecotoxicity te
sts were prepared in Petri dishes with ﬁlter
paper supported with 2.0ml of the solubilized extract and 10
lettuce seeds. Petri dishes were then wrapped with polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) ﬁlm and incubated at 20 ±2◦C for 120h in
thedark.
Positive control was prepared using 0.05M zinc sulfate to
inhibit seed germination and negative control using deionized
watertotestthebasegerminationandgrowthvaluesoftheseeds
(SobreroandRonco,2004).
Thefollowing
parametersweredetermined:seedgermination,

elongation(%R)attheCN.TheGIwasusedtoassessthetoxicity

Data Analysis
Procedure
s of Shapiro–Wilk and Bartlett checked the normalcy
andhomoscedasticityofthedataset,respectively,andtheanalysis
of variance tested the signiﬁcance of eﬀect of factors on the
soil phytoremediation. The tests were separated by post hoc
Tukey’s honest signiﬁcant diﬀerence (HSD) test. The data of
temporal variability were ﬁtted for Gompertz (Equation 2). This
stochastic model has probability density function enough to
predict how long would it take the green manure in soil withtebuthiuron and stillage to reach the maximum of growth and
develop and stop. The kinetic parameters, α,β, and κ, will
assistindraftinginferencesaboutthepotentialphytoremediators

he herbicide alone was more toxic to C. cajan andC.
ensiforms.Incontrast, M.pruriens andP.glaucum resistedlonger
to chemically stressed microenvironment. Vinasse addition
signiﬁcantly reduced the toxicity. Hence, green manure species
producedlargeramountsofmassofrootsandshootsinthesesoil
samples(Figure1).
Advantages of vinasse on the ecotoxicity were more
prominent in M. pruriens andP. glaucum. These were the
most eﬀective strategies of manuring for phytoremediation
potential. The primary assumption for vinasse attenuation
by on phytotoxicity of soil may be its availability of soluble
carbon. Thus, it is likely to power up the microbial metabolism
and enhance the subsequent degradation of pesticides ( Prata
et al.,
2000, 2001; Villaverde et al., 2008). Tebuthiuron is
highly
available and can move smoothly through the structure
of agricultural soils with lows levels of organic matter and
clay (Chang and Stritzke, 1977). These authors reported
40.00 and
1.00% herbicide adsorbed in particles at 4.8 and
0.30% organic matter, respectively. Bioavailability is one
of the keys to an eﬀective and consistent biodegradation.
If the pollutant or contaminant is not available from the
environment, (micro)organism cannot successfully perform
longer. The nature and physicochemical properties of
the pesticide (e.g., chemical stability, spatial structure,
feedback eﬀect, and intermediate metabolites) and itsmultiplicity of interactions with the rhizosphere are factors
inﬂuencing greatly its bioavailability and, of course, kinetics
ofbiodegradation.
Kinetics of Growth and Development
The Gompertz approach predicted accurately how long would
it take for the chemical contamination of soil by tebuthiuron
to become limiting for the growth and development of green
manure species (Figure2 ). Estimates for the absolute primary
growth rate for the C. cajanin soil with tebuthiuron and vinasse
combinedwasthelowest(Table2).Aslongasthetargetmolecule
is rather persistent than readily degradable, the more probable
the strategy of manuring is to ineﬃciently decontaminate an
area. The highest estimations for both the maximum of size and
absolute growth rate for this potential phytoremediator in soil
with no tebuthiuron supported the high phytotoxicity of this
herbicidetotheprimarygrowth.
Incontrast,theassociationoftebuthiuronandvinasseallowed
C.ensiformis toachieveitshighestprimarygrowthrate,whether
speciﬁcorabsolute.Thenegativeestimationforabsolutegrowth
rate for this specie in soil with tebuthiuron alone was proof that
vinassewasaneﬀectivesourceofnutrientstospeeduptheplant’s
growth and development, thus assisting in phytoremediation.
The use of this agroindustrial residue also enhanced the height
ofM. pruriens andP. glaucum in soil samples with tebuthiuron.
Theherbicideseverelylimitedthedevelopmentof C.cajanandC.
ensiformis,accordingtothelowestestimationsforstemdiameter.
Thus,M. pruriens andP. glaucum are recommended over C.
cajanandC. ensiforms for the phytoremediation of tebuthiuron
in ﬁelds of sugarcane, even without the application of vinasse.
The growth and development of C. juncea, the bioindicator
chosen for this contaminant, became healthier and longer when
sowingeither M.pruriens andP.glaucum.
Performance of C.juncea as Bioindicator
of Phytoremediation
The combination of tebuthiuron and vinasse considerably
dropped the height, stem diameter, and number of leaves in C.
junceaovertime,comparedtothecontrol(Figure3).Incontrast,
the herbicide alone had no signiﬁcant eﬀect, whether negative
or positive, on the growth and development by the bioindicator
species sowed after growing green manure species, consistent
withtheoutcomesofexplanatoryanalysis.
The explanation for the extensive decrease in leaves
production (Table3 ) may be either phytotoxicity by the
compounds at high concentrations in soil or natural senescence,
as plants become metabolically and physiologically ineﬀective
over time. In contrast, the control soil sample (without
tebuthiuron and vinasse) peaked in height, stem diameter,
and number of leaves. Therefore, C. juncea was highly
susceptible to tebuthiuron. Practically, this molecule more
severely disabled both C. cajan andC. ensiformis to grow
and develop as healthily as possible prior to sowing C. juncea
for monitoring the potential phytoremediation of soil with
greenmanure.
The behavior of bioindicator species C. juncea supported
how persistent should be tebuthiuron in a microenvironment,

regardless of vinasse application as source of nutrients to
speed up
the growth and development and, hence, assist
green manure species in extensively remediating the herbicide.C. cajan andC. ensiformis ended up much more eﬀectively
remediating tebuthiuron and, hence, ensured the soil more
suitable for the bioindicator species’ growth and development

(Pires et al., 2008), inconsistent with the trends in this study.
Some plants
are capable of highly remediating contaminants
(Ferraço et al., 2017). Cultivation of C. junce aslightly reduced
sulfentrazone concentration in soil. Bioindicators of this
herbicide then grew more consistently over time, regardless of
sowing density, but not as consistent as control assay (Ferraço
etal.,
2019).
Franco et al. (2014) reported phytoremediation beneﬁts by
Phaseolus
vulgarison the growth and development of Urochloa
brizantha. Plant heigh, leaf production, and area all increased
inC. juncea with decreasing concentration of contaminant.
Thus, the longer the postcultivation is, the more probable the
phytoremediationistobecomingeﬀective.
Beans in soil with picloram at 32.00g ha−1produced low
amount of dry mass due to plants’ death at high pesticide
concentration. However, this morphological trait increased with
phytoremediation by the Urochloa sp. (Franco et al., 2015).
Belo et al. (2016) reported similar trend for the dry mass
ofP. glaucum a
fter phytoremediation by C. juncea andC.
ensiformis. Data on phytoremediation potential of herbicides,
like sulfentrazone, by P. glaucum are neither conclusive nor
conducive to commercial application yet, and this requires
furtherinvestigations(Madalãoetal.,2012a,b).Thesereferences
supported t
he major ﬁndings in this study on the negative
eﬀect of tebuthiuron on biomass accumulation in roots
and shoots of green manures species. Other reliable and
executablebioindicatorsofsoildecontaminationareﬁngermillet
(Eleusine cocracana), for chlorimuron-ethyl and sulfumeturon-
methyl ( Assis et al., 2010), and cucumber for picloram
(Galonetal.,2017).
Ecotoxicity Bioassays
T
he principal component analysis robustly reduced the
dimensionality of dataset and preserved as much interpretable
variability as possible into the components, PC Iand
PCII. These components, collectively, explained ∼70.00%
variance in ecotoxicity of soil samples on germination,
growth, and development of the test-organism L. sativa
(Table4).
The ﬁrst component, attributable to seed physiological
vigor, had positive correlations with hypocotyl length and
germination index (GI). Cartesian coordinates for soil
samples with phytoremediation by either M. pruriens and
P. glaucum structurally were positive in the upper right
quadrant in the factorial map (Figure4). Therefore, the
more eﬀective the tebuthiuron biodegradation is, the less
probable the contaminant is to become toxic during the
germination and primary growth of L. sativa seeds. The
second component, attributable to physiological anomaly
by phytotoxicity, had positive and negative loadings with
germination and hypocotyl length, respectively. Soil samples
withP. glaucum and hypocotyl were closer together in the
lower right quadrant. Thus, this species should be of greaterrelevance to ensure plant growing and development without
any severe physiological anomaly by tebuthiuron in site
withoutvinasse.
CONCLUSION
Green manure species and vinasse can remediate soils with
tebuthiuron.Preliminaryevidenceof M.pruriens andP.glaucum
showtheirincreasedcapabilitiesofphytoremediatingsiteswhere
the target herbicide exists. These species, in association with
vinasse as source of soluble carbon, can decontaminate the
system more eﬀectively than C. cajan andC. ensiformis, thus
enablingthebioindicator C.juncea togrowanddevelophealthier
inthepresenceofresidualtebuthiuron.Aslongasthemanuring
by fertilizing agents is eﬀective in remediating the soil, the
less probable tebuthiuron persists at high concentrations in
soil and, thus, becoming harmful to non-target organisms as
shown in ecotoxicity bioassays. Undergerminated seeds and
severe physiological anomalies due to phytotoxicity in roots
and hypocotyl of L. sativa are likely to decrease quickly
with phytoremediation by M. pruriens andP. glaucum, which
is the best chance to do this. Findings of this study are
timely and should be of great importance to development
and implementation of cost-eﬀective strategies to assist in
mitigating contamination of soil by tebuthiuron in sugarcane
crops with vinasse application as biofertilizer. The fate of this
herbicide and its potential metabolites in soil and into tissues
of green manure species, especially M. pruriens andP. glaucum,
is prone to scaled up designs toward an eﬀective and safe
industrial usage and could be the focus of further investigations.

Per- and polyﬂuoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are Synthetic Organic Compounds (SOCs)
which are of current concern as they are linked to a myriad of adverse health
effects in mammals. They can be found in drinking water, rivers, groundwater,
wastewater, household dust, and soils. In this review, the current challenge and status
of bioremediation of PFAs in soils was examined. While several technologies to remove
PFAS from soil have been developed, including adsorption, ﬁltration, thermal treatment,
chemicaloxidation/reductionandsoilwashing,thesemethodsareexpensive,impractical
forin situtreatment, use high pressures and temperatures, with most resulting in toxic
waste. Biodegradation has the potential to form the basis of a cost-effective, large scale
insituremediationstrategyforPFASremovalfromsoils.Bothfungalandbacterialstrains
have been isolated that are capable of degrading PFAS; however, to date, information
regarding the mechanisms of degradation of PFAS is limited. Through the application of
new technologies in microbial ecology, such as stable isotope probing, metagenomics,
transcriptomics, and metabolomics there is the potential to examine and identify the
biodegradation of PFAS, a process which will underpin the development of any robust
PFAS bioremediation technology.

INTRODUCTION
As a result of continued production and use, per- and polyﬂuoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have
becomewidespreadintheenvironment,includingdrinkingwater,rivers,groundwater,wastewater,
household dust, and soils ( Kim et al.,2007;Eriksson and Karrman, 2015;Shi etal., 2015; Eriksson
et
al., 2017; Von Der Trenck et al., 2018). PFAS are highly stable organic compounds that contain
multiplec
arbon-ﬂuorinebonds.Theyareusedinvariouscommercialproducts,includingaqueous
ﬁre-ﬁghting foams and products with non-stick coatings. These compounds are also likely to be
presentinfoods(Schaideretal.,2017)andareknowntobepresentinhumans,includingpregnant
women(
Lauritzenetal.,2016).
Humane
xposuretoPFASoccursthroughseveralpathways,includingingestionofcontaminated
drinking water, food and household dust, inhalation of indoor air, and contact with other
contaminated media ( Trudel et al., 2008). Drinking water sources include rivers, lakes and

plants, which are often used in agriculture, with exposure
through contaminated soils and crop foods (Sunderland et al.,
2019). PF
AS have been shown to have bioaccumulation
potential, whic
h tends to increase with increasing chain
length. Speciﬁc PFAS compounds have been shown to impact
human health through altered kidney and thyroid function,

diseases include kidney and testicular cancers, ulcerative colitis,
andhighcholesterolhavealsobeenobserved(Darrowetal.,2013;
Steenland et
al., 2013; Starling et al., 2017; Sunderland et al.,
2019). PFOS and PFOA are readily absorbed through the gut
and are
not metabolized, meaning body loads become excessive
before they are excreted. PFAS are believed to act as endocrine
disruptors through alterations in estrogen- and androgen-
receptor functions (Mora et al., 2017). Research conducted by
Tao et
al. found that PFOS and PFOA accumulate in the serum
of adults and blood of newborn babies, which indicates that

the biodegradation of PFAS by fungal and bacteria is limited.
Consequently, this review aims to review chemical properties,
the source of PFAS contamination in soils and summarize
the remediation technologies, focussing on the potential of
bioremediation for the safe and eﬀective removal of PFAS
fromsoils.
CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF PER-AND
POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFAS)
COMPONENTS
Per-and polyﬂuoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of
synthetic man-made compounds manufactured for their ability
to interact between two immiscible ﬂuid phases acting as a
surfactant ( Buck et al., 2011; Rahman et al., 2014). PFAS are
highly
polar and contain strong carbon-ﬂuorine bonds (C-
F) which display unique amphiphilic properties (Figure1).
Generally,mostPFASexhibit(i)highthermalresistance,(ii)high
chemicalstability,and(iii)resistancetobioticdegradation(Buck
et al.,
2011; Lindstrom et al., 2011; Rahman et al., 2014 ). Two
broadc
ategoriesofPFAShavebeendeﬁned:•Perﬂuoroalkylsubstances typicallycompriseofshortandlong
carbons chains (C2-C13+) and have a charged functional
group head which is attached to one end. Generally, this
functionalgroupwillbeacarboxylicorsulfonicacid.Fluorine
atomsattachtoallbondingsitesonthecarbonchainexceptfor
the last carbon group head forming multiple carbon-ﬂuorine
(C-F) bonds (Figure1). C-F bonds have the dissociation
energy of 450 kJ mol−1compared to carbon-chlorine and
carbon-bromine bonds at 330 and 194 kJ mol−1, respectively
(Parsonsetal.,2008).
•Polyﬂuoroalkyl sub
stancesare not fully ﬂuorinated. These
substances have at least one lapse in the chain which is not
a ﬂuorinated atom—typically hydrogen or oxygen—which
attaches to one of the carbon-chain tails. Polyﬂuoroalkyl
chains contain carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds which create
weak chains that are susceptible to biotic or abiotic
degradation(Bucketal.,2011).
Three spe
ciﬁc PFAS compounds, perﬂuorooctane sulfonate
(PFOS), perﬂuorooctane acid (PFOA) and perﬂuorohexane
sulfonate (PFHxS) (Figure1 ) are known to have been
contained in much older Aqueous Film Forming Foams
(AFFF). Within environmental pH values, both PFOA and
PFOS exist as anions ( Rahman et al., 2014). Generally, PFAS
do not
degrade in water or soil under normal conditions,
although it is thought that they can undergo physiochemical
changes and breakdown into smaller alkyl chains ( Teaf
et al.,
2019). The physicochemical properties of these three
major
PFAS compounds are presented in Table1and further
discussedbelow:
•Perﬂuorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS), CAS number 1763-23-
1, is a completely ﬂuorinated compound that contains eight
carbonatomsandasulfonategrouphead.PFOShasbeenused
as coatings and protectants. PFOS is produced commercially
fromperﬂuorooctanesulfonlyﬂuoride(POSF)whichwasused
as an intermediate to produce other ﬂuorochemicals. PFOS
is formulated by C 8HF17O3S1which has a molecular mass
of 500.13 g/mol. PFOS is produced through Simons Electro-
Chemical ﬂuorination (SECF), which produces 70% linear
chains and 30% branched chains isomers. PFOS can also be
created through telomerization which produces linear chains.
As PFOS has major impurities in the form of other POSF-
derived ﬂuorochemicals it can be formed in the environment
throughthedegradationofPOSF-basedproducts(Bucketal.,
2011).
•Perﬂuorooc
tanoic Acid (PFOA), CAS number 335-67-1, is a
completely ﬂuorinated organic acid with seven-carbon (C7)
atoms and a carboxyl functional group head. PFOA has been
a main constituent of AFFFs, as well as non-stick coats, and

Based
on the physiochemical properties, PFAS have been
identiﬁed to have bioaccumulation potential, which tends to
increase with increasing chain length. Most health research
has been conducted on individuals with high levels of PFAS
accumulated in their organs due to work on containment sites,
airbases, and in response ﬁreﬁghting. A signiﬁcant number
of PFOA-related chronic diseases which include kidney and
testicular cancers, ulcerative colitis, high cholesterol have been
reported among PFAS-exposed individuals ( Darrow et al., 2013;
Steenland et
al., 2013; Starling et al., 2017; Sunderland et al.,
2019). PFOS and PFOA are readily absorbed through the gut
and are
not metabolized, meaning body loads become excessive
before they are excreted. PFAS are believed to act as endocrine
disruptors through the alteration in estrogen- and androgen-
receptorfunctions(Moraetal.,2017).HumanexposuretoPFAS,producedby
industry,occursthroughingestionofcontaminated
drinking water, food and household dust, inhalation of indoor
air, and contact with other contaminated media ( Trudel et al.,
2008).
Drinking water sources include rivers, lakes, and ground
water,
which can all be contaminated from industrial sources.
In addition, there appears a signiﬁcant exposure risk from
contaminated treated sewage sludge (biosolids), as fertilizer, and
recycledwaterfromwastewatertreatmentplants,whichareoften

SOURCES OF

Aqueous Film Forming Foams (AFFFs)
Aqueous Film
Forming Foams (AFFFs) are intended to be used
on ﬂammable liquid ﬁres through the process of combining
hydrocarbon foaming agents with ﬂuorinated surfactants when
mixed with water (Backe et al., 2013). This creates interfacial
tension t
hat spreads across the surface of a hydrocarbon fuel,
whichextinguishestheﬂame,andformsavaporbarrierbetween
the fuel and atmospheric oxygen, preventing re-ignition (Backe
etal.,
2013;Weineretal.,2013;Harding-Marjanovicetal.,2015).
Theﬂuorotelomer
AFFF,althoughnotdirectlymadewithPFOA,
and therefore less toxic to the environment has precursors that
breakdown into PFOA in the natural environment (Backe et al.,
2013; Weiner
et al., 2013; Harding-Marjanovic et al., 2015).
Typically,
ﬂuorotelomer based AFFF contains short-chain (C6)
PFASwhichcanrangefrom50to98%shortchainsbalancedwith
long-chainPFASwhichcanbreakdowntoPFOA.
Firetrainingfacilitiesundergoextensiveandprolongeduseof
AFFFs, which has caused large volumes of PFAS to be released
into adjacent soils during short periods (Dauchy et al., 2019).
From t
here PFAS leaches into groundwater supplies. Soils that
do not contain high amounts of Total Organic Matter (TOC)
through a lack of vegetation, land clearing, and anthropogenic
abuse make it diﬃcult for the chemicals to bind within the soil
substrate ( Allred et al., 2015; Gallen et al., 2018). Dauchy et al.
(2019)sampled

ﬁreﬁg
hting drill sites active for more than 30 years and detected
PFOS, 6:2 FTSA and 6:2 FTAB as the most predominant PFAS
in surface soil; the highest total concentrations detected were
357µg g−1, despite the presence of clay layers. However, the
highest total PFAS concentrations were detected in the wells
at the perimeter of the ﬁreﬁghter training site as well as the
spring located downgradient of the groundwater ﬂow. These
concentrations ranged from 300 to 8,300 ng L−1; 6:2 FTAB
was detected in water table 20m belowground indicating these
chemicalsarenotcontained.
Landﬁll Leachate
Landﬁlls are designed to undergo large amounts of
decompositionfromnaturalandman-madeorganiccompounds.
Realistically, landﬁll serves as temporal and spatial storage. In
a landﬁll, soil chemistry is heavily compromised which
impacts natural degradation processes due to the number and
nature of pollutants present. PFAS within waste can become
mobile and leach into pore water creating contaminated
leachate. Fortunately, modern sanitary landﬁlls typically
have stringent mechanisms for preventing and mitigating
leachate from entering groundwater. However, the controlled
discharge of leachate to wastewater treatment plants is allowed.
Reinforcement of smaller and older sites to stop the threat of
local point source contamination into surrounding soil and
groundwater is paramount. PFAS will continue to persist in
the landﬁll and continue to increase over time ( Gallen et al.,
2018).
Studies examining landﬁll leachate conﬁrmed that
PFHxS
was detected at high concentrations (mean 1,700 ng
L−1; range 73–25,000 ng L−1); PFOA contamination was on
average 690 ng L−1(range of 17–7,500 ng L−1) and PFOS was
detected at concentrations with a mean of 310 ng L−1(range13–2,700 ng L−1). Samples from sites with higher levels of PFAS
proﬁles generally had greater proportions of construction and
demolition waste. Dealing with landﬁll chemistry will require
novel treatment pathways to deal with the existing PFAS loads
on-site(Hamidetal.,2018).
Hepburn et al. (2019) stated that groundwater systems
are at
risk from increased urban re-development on former
industriallandandthiswouldleadtoincreasedhumanexposure
to PFAS. Their research indicates that legacy landﬁlls are
poorly constructed in major Australian urban developmental
precincts. PFOS, PFHxS, PFOA, and PFBS were all detected in
samplessurrounding13samplelocationsincludingsitesdirectly
on waste material and down-gradient of landﬁlls indicating
evidence of leachate contamination. Many urban areas contain
unknownamountsoflegacylandﬁllswhichmaylackanyformer

localaquifers.

the application of recycled water from wastewater treatment
plants, landﬁll leachates and biosolids applied to agricultural
land (Blaine et al., 2014; Ghisi et al., 2019). Venkatesan and
Halden (2014) monitored
soil amended with PFAS-containing
biosolids
over 3 years. They observed a loss of short-chain
PFAS compounds within 100 days of application, due mainly to
groundwater and surface water leaching. In a laboratory-based
studybyAllredetal.(2015) onthephysicalandbiologicalrelease
of PF
AS from landﬁll leachate, they reported that increased
leaching occurred from biological reactors under methanogenic
conditionscomparedtoabioticreactors.
Once in agricultural lands, PFAS can be taken into the
root systems of plants including cereals, fruits, and vegetables.
PFAS with higher chain lengths are usually restricted to the
roots, whereas shorter chains compounds can extend further
(Ghisi et al., 2019). Generally, the physicochemical properties of
the soil
together with the plant uptake system will determine
the rate and accumulation of PFAS; however, generally, PFOS
accumulatesatgreaterconcentrationscomparedtoPFOA. Pérez
et al.
(2013)showed that the PFAS in human tissue was 263
and 807
ng g−1in the kidney and lung. In plants, the amount
varied; however, most experiments used the spike method for
contamination of soil. For example, Stahl et al. (2009) showed
that
ryegrass accumulated PFAS ranged between 408 and 7,520
µg kg−1dry weight when the soil was contaminated with 0–
50mgkg−1PFAS.
PFAS in Soil Systems
As a consequence of these major sources of PFAS, these
compoundsarealmostubiquitouslydetectedintheenvironment
(Xiaoetal.,2015;Luetal.,2018).Researchhasindicatedthatsoil
org
anic carbon content is the dominant solid-phase parameter
which aﬀects the adsorption of PFAS. Solid matrices inﬂuence
the environmental fate of hydrophobic organic contaminants
(Higgins and Luthy, 2006). However, the diﬀerent behavior of
PFA
S in comparison to traditional ionisable organic pollutants
is due to their hydrophobic and hydrophilic functionalities
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org 4 J anuary 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 602040
101Shahsavari et al. Biological T reatment of PFAS-Contaminated Soils
(Li et al., 2018). Adsorption to soil or sediment can occur
through
two-mechanisms: interaction of their hydrophobic
ﬂuorinated carbon tails with the organic carbon fraction of the
soil, or to a lesser extent by electrostatic interactions of the
polar head group with the charged clay fraction ( Kucharzyk
et al.,
2017). Longer-chained PFAS appear to sorb to soils
more re
adily. PFAS with sulfonate groups sorb more than
carboxylates. In comparison to PFOS which has a higher
sorption capacity, PFOA is usually found in the dissolved
phase. Perﬂuorinated acids appear to bind to soils with higher
total organic carbon (TOC) and iron oxide concentrations;
Li et al. (2018) achieved an adsorption equilibrium in ∼48h.
T
heir results indicated that both PFOS and PFOA adsorption
are inﬂuenced by TOC, proteins and saccharides. Similarly,
iron and aluminum oxides also appear to be key parameters
for adsorption of PFAS. Some forest soil vegetation shows
greater ability to accumulate PFAS; the background levels of
PFOA and PFOS in 28 forest soils suggested that PFOA
concentrations were greater in precipitation at higher altitudes
(Cabrerizo et al., 2018). In contrast, the concentration of PFOA
in temperate
grasslands appears to be much lower (Wang et al.,
2018).
Insummary,
bothbioaccumulationandtranslocationofPFAS
occurfrombothnaturalterrestrialandaquaticenvironmentsand
anthropologicallybuilt-upareas(GiesyandKannan,2001,2002;
Giesy
et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2016; Hepburn
et al., 2019). The distribution of PFAS is enhanced by leaching
and dis
charge into adjacent locations from treatment plants
and urbanized redevelopments; eventually reaching oceans,
including the North Paciﬁc and the Arctic Ocean ( Cai et al.,
2012; Hepburn
et al., 2019). However in addition, PFAS are
now t
hought to be able to travel through airborne particles
and wet and dry atmospheric deposition (Nakayama et al.,
2019).
T
here is
only limited information regarding the fate of PFAS
intheenvironment.Thisisinpartduetothediﬃcultyassociated
with the detection of PFAS in the environment. Avoiding
cross-contamination in the sample is diﬃcult due to ambient
atmospheric contamination. Most materials will at some point
directly come in contact with ﬂuorocarbons (Nakayama et al.,
2019).
REMEDIATION
APPROACHES
Technological approaches looking at the removal of PFAS
from waste streams or contaminated environments tend to
be expensive or impractical for the in situremoval of the
contamination (Kucharzyk et al., 2017) (Table2). Energy-
intensive met
hods, such as high pressures and temperatures
can disrupt and harm the balance of delicate ecosystems. Non-
energy-intensive technologies such as granular activated carbon
adsorption, sonolysis (generating chemical reactions using an
acoustic ﬁeld in a solution) and reverse osmosis have all shown
somepotentialapplicationforPFASremovalduringﬁeldstudies
(Kucharzyk et al., 2017; Sorengard et al., 2019). Unfortunately,
however
, most treatment methods appear to collect rather thandismantle the C-F bonds, resulting in a residue containing PFAS
thatinevitablyneedstobeplacedinalandﬁll.
Several methods, including adsorption, ﬁltration, thermal,
chemical oxidation/reduction and soil washing have been
developed for the removal of PFAS from environments. An
outlineoftheseapproachesisshownin Table2.Likeallmethods,
there are both advantages and disadvantages related to each
method. For example, soil washing is an ex situtechnology
which requires low technology input. However, it is expensive
andmayleadtowatercontamination( deBruecker,2015).These
tec
hnologies have been thoroughly reviewed (Kucharzyk et al.,
2017;M
ahinroostaandSenevirathna,2020).Whilesomeofthese
tec
hnologies have shown promising outcomes in laboratory-
based studies, their cost-eﬀectiveness, ﬁeld applicability and
feasibility are open to question (Mahinroosta and Senevirathna,
2020).
Current commercial methods for remediating PFAS-
contaminated
environments, based on the use of one or more
of the above treatments are only available for groundwater and
not soils. There is therefore an urgent need to develop methods
for thein situbioremediation in the soil at sites contaminated
by PFAS. Chemical and physical methods tend to be more
expensivethanbioremediationapproaches,sincebioremediation

Bioremediation, whic
h is the use of a biological agent
to breakdown contaminants, could represent a simple,
environmentally safe and cost-eﬀective technology to treat
PFAS-contaminated soils. The commercial application of
bioremediation has been successfully applied to remediate a
varietyoforganiccontaminantssuchaspetroleumhydrocarbons,

Bioremediation
Options
Biodegradation of PFAS may involve enzymes that directly
remove ﬂuorine atoms from these compounds either (i) by
adding oxygen across the F-C bond, i.e., oxidation, or (ii)
adding electrons across the F-C bond, i.e., reduction, allowing
other normal assimilation enzymes to breakdown the rest of the
compound.TheF-Cbondisverystrongandthereforediﬃcultto

Indigenous bacterial species isolated from PFAS-contaminated
environments have shown the ability to remediate PFAS
compounds; two strains of Pseudomonas (PS27 and PDMF10)
were able to remove 32 and 28% of PFAS compounds,
respectively, within 10 days of incubation under alkanotrophic
conditions(Presentatoetal.,2020).Further,adecreaseofaround
32%in
PFAS was also reported during a 96h incubation of
Pseudomonasparafulva (Yietal.,2016)alongwitha67%decreaseinPF
AS concentration over 48h incubation of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (Kwon et al., 2014). In another study, Pseudomonas
plecogloss
icidautilized PFAS as an energy source, producing
perﬂuoroheptanoic acid and releasing ﬂuorine ions as a result
(Chetverikov et al., 2017). A recent publication reported that
following incub
ation of the ammonium oxidizing bacterium,
Acidimicrobium sp. strain A6 with hydrogen as the sole electron
donor for 100 days a 60% reduction in PFAS concentration was
observed( HuangandJaﬀé,2019).
While t
hese studies focussed on relatively small organic
compounds that contained ﬂuorine atoms, they may help
us to understand how selected microbes may break F-C
bonds in PFAS. In these terms, it may be also useful to
consider microbial activities known to break Cl-C bonds. For

example, Dehalobacter sp. strain TeCB1 was able to carry
out the reductive dechlorination of 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene
to 1,3- and 1,4-dichlorobenzene with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene
being the intermediate daughter product (Alfán-Guzmán et al.,
2017).
A key enzyme is PceC, and the C subunit of the
tetrac
hloroethene (PCE) reductive dehalogenase is encoded by
the conserved pceABCT gene cluster identiﬁed in the microbial
strainDehalobacter restrictus PER-K23 (Buttet et al., 2018).

bacteria able to use halogenated organic compounds as terminal
electronacceptors(Buttetetal.,2018).
In terms
of potential enzymes capable of degradading PFAS,
reduction could be undertaken by a P450-type enzyme or
similar. In organic chemistry F, in F-C bonds, can be replaced
by transition metals (Kiplinger et al., 1994), and therefore
transition met
al-dependent enzymes can release F from F-C
bonds (Figure2). The F in F-C bonds is signiﬁcantly electro-
negative,andthereforecanpromoteattractiontotransitionmetal
cations. The value of a transition metal in an enzyme reaction is
to allow the recycling of its charge state. For example, P450-type
enzymes contain a transition iron cation, with activity modiﬁed
by a heme group for its reaction. Some mixed-function oxidases
and horseradish peroxidases have been reported to deﬂuorinate
monoﬂuorinatedcompounds( GoldmanandMilne,1966).
Recently a
mode of oxygen-independent deﬂuorination was
identiﬁed for the complete degradation of para-substituted
ﬂuoroaromatics by the denitrifying bacterium Thauera
aromatica. This microbe utilizes a class I benzoyl-coenzyme
A (BzCoA) reductase (BCR), which catalyzes the ATP-
dependent deﬂuorination of 4-F-BzCoA to BzCoA. Other
enzymes involved are 1,5-dienoyl-CoA hydratase (DCH)
and bifunctional 6-oxo-1-enoyl-CoA hydrolase (OAH). The
outcome of the complete degradation of 2-F-benzoate isthe production of HF and CO 2(Tiedt et al., 2016, 2017)
(Figure2
).
Both F-1,5-dienoyl-CoA isomers (compounds 2/2∗)
are hydrated to diﬀerent F-OH-1-enoyl-CoA isomers
(compounds 11/11∗) by DCH and OAH, respectively.
Unstable 6-F-6-OH-1-enoyl-CoA (11∗) spontaneously
decomposes to 6-oxo-1-enoyl-CoA (compound 7) by HF-
expulsion. This, in the presence of OAH becomes immediately
hydrated presumably to 2-oxo-6-OH-cyclohexanoyl-CoA
(compound 12) before hydrolysis to 3-OH-pimeloyl-
CoA (compound 8). Stable 2-F-6-OH-1-enoyl-CoA
(compound 11) can also only be further hydrated by OAH,
apparently to the unstable 2-F-2,6-di-OH-cyclohexanoyl-
CoA intermediate, which spontaneously decomposes to
compound 12 before ring hydrolysis by OAH. Intermediates
illustrated with brackets probably only occur transiently
(Tiedtetal.,2017).
Microbial
Interaction With PFAS
Perﬂuorinated chemicals are chemically very stable and
metabolically either completely stable or barely biodegradable
so that they can be classiﬁed as persistent substances ( Von
Der Trenck
et al., 2018). However, investigations have inferred
that
limited biotransformation of these chemicals can occur in
natural and industrial environments. It is, therefore, important
to understand what biotransformation occurs in practice, given
the variation in toxicity across the range of potential PFAS
products that may be produced due to biotransformation. A
further goal is to ﬁnd organisms that can signiﬁcantly remove
ﬂuorine atoms from these compounds to substantially reduce
theirtoxicityandstability.
It has been demonstrated that ﬂuorinated precursors can be
transformed to PFAS, with variable eﬃciency by a range of
biologicalsystems(soil/wastewater; LiuandAvendano,2013;Lee
etal.,
2014). Attempts have been made to infer pathways for the
biotransformation
ofﬂuorinatedprecursors( D’eonandMabury,

2007; Rhoads et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009; Liu and Avendano,
2013; Lewis
et al., 2016) (Figure3). Howe ver, these tend to be
limited to side chains, without signiﬁcant removal of ﬂuorine
atoms. This is unfortunate, in terms of potentially increased
toxicity, though may provide a useful basis to further investigate
biodegradationofPFAS.
In a further study, two diﬀerent microbial consortia were
isolated from two river sediments in Saitama and Osaka, Japan,
known for long term pollution with PFOS and PFOA (Beskoski
et al.,
2018). Amicrobial chemoorganoheterotrophic consortia
which
includedbacteria,yeastandmoldswasabletosigniﬁcantly
decrease concentrations of PFOS and PFOA between 46–69%
and 16–36%, respectively. However, deﬂuorinated PFOS and
PFOA products were not detected, though several metabolites
were found only in samples from consortia with PFOS andPFOA. It was suggested these were associated with unsaturated
monoﬂuorinated fatty acids and hydrocarbons with multiple
unsaturated bonds or ring structures (Beskoski et al., 2018).
Nevert
heless, if conﬁrmed, this is problematic as the ﬂuorine
is still attached to an organic molecule that could be simply
transferredtootherorganismsthroughafoodweb.
While speciﬁc biodegrading pathways for some PFAS have
been investigated ( Liu and Avendano, 2013), for many PFAS,
the pat
hways are unknown. Moreover, the types of enzymes and
associatedgenesinvolvedhavenotbeenreported.Adegradation
pathway for a particular PFAS may be investigated by assessing
the intermediate products in a sampling time series. Organisms
able to degrade these compounds may optimally be selected
from environmental areas that have been polluted with the
particular PFAS. This approach has been utilized for developing

by a search of the KEGG database (Kanehisa et al., 2018) to
conﬁrm t
he type of enzymes and infer the structural genes that
producetheseenzymes.It is also important to understand the biodegrading
pathways of PFAS precursors in more detail, to potentially
support bioremediation of PFAS and their precursors. It
is also useful to recognize that transformations of PFAS
may be potentially caused by chemical factors, as well as
biologicalactivities.

106Shahsavari et al. Biological T reatment of PFAS-Contaminated Soils
While biotransformation of PFAS commonly occurs, high
concentrations may
reduce biotransformation rates due to
chemical toxicity. The impact of PFOA on the activated sludge
process has been assessed using a lab-scale sequencing batch
reactor, which was continuously exposed to PFOA (Yu et al.,
2018).
This method used a representative concentration for
PFA
S (20mg L−1) to mimic extreme conditions from industrial
waste or groundwater from ﬁre-ﬁghting practice sites. The
results indicate that PFOA restrained microbial growth which
aﬀected dissolved organic carbon removal. Also, continued
exposure to PFOA resulted in a signiﬁcant shift in community
structure,leadingtothepresenceofmorePFOA-tolerantspecies
(Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and in particular Acidobacteria)
(Table3).
It is important to investigate biodegradation of PFAS under
bothaerobicandanaerobicconditionsandinparticular,toassess
biotransformation intermediates in a reductive environment
(Liu and Avendano, 2013), given the current limited PFAS
biodegrad
ation reported in aerobic environments. An oxygen-
independent pathway may lead to enhanced degradation (Tiedt
etal.,
2016,2017).
Mycoremediation
To
date, research is limited on their ability of fungi to degrade
PFAS.Thisisperhapssurprisinggiventheyareknowntodegrade
lignin, one of the most recalcitrant natural compounds along
with many toxic natural and xenobiotic compounds including
organochlorines [e.g., DDT and DDE, organophosphates,
pesticides, including chlorpyrifos and polychlorinated biphenyls
(Beaudette et al., 2000) andpolyaromatic hydrocarbons
(Moghimietal.,2017)].
White-rot fungi
in particular have displayed relative success
intermsofthebiotransformationoforganictoxicants,including
polychlorinated biphenyls, organophosphate pesticides and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Kaur et al., 2016; Stella
et al.,
2017; Harry-Asobara and Kamei, 2019). There are very
few studie
s examining their ability to degrade PFAS. Tseng
et al.
(2014)reported some promising preliminary results
looking at
the eﬀects of wood-rotting fungus on 6:2 FTOH,
using the ligninolytic fungi, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. P.
chrysosporium was capable of transforming 50% of 6:2 FTOH
and 70% 8:2 FTOH in 28 days. Major metabolites of 6:2
FTOHincluded5:3polyﬂuorinatedacid(40%),5:2FTOH(10%),
PFHxA (4%). In contrast, the non-lignolytic fungus Aspergillus
nigerwas unable to transform 6:2 FTOH over 35 days. while
the same study reported that P. chrysosporium was capable of
transforming 20% PFOS within 28 days. However, this research
was conducted in a laboratory; it remains to be determined
whether ligninolytic fungi are capable of degrading PFAS in
theenvironment.
Phytoremediation
Phytoremediation represents another potential bioremediation
approach for PFAS removal from contaminated environments
due to the ability of several plants to bioaccumulate
PFAS. Although PFAS are not extensively degraded during
phytoremediation, bioaccumulation in plants creates a potentialroute for removal of PFAS from contaminated environments.
Phytoremediation has been successfully used for the removal of
severalenvironmentalcontaminantsincludingheavymetalsand
chlorinatedsubstances( Huﬀetal.,2020).
Several
plants have been used to accumulate PFAS. The
wetland species Juncus eﬀuses accumulated 11.4% of seven PFAS
compounds from PFAS-spiked soil ( Zhang et al., 2019). Betula
pendulaandPice
a abieswere reported to accumulate up to 97
and 94 ng g−1, respectively, during a study at a ﬁreﬁghting
training site near Stockholm, Sweden, contaminated with 26
PFAS compounds (Gobelius et al., 2017). The phytoremediation
of PF
AS contaminated soils using herbaceous and woody
plant species has also been reported (Huﬀ et al., 2020).
The potential
of several plants in a greenhouse study to
bioaccumulate 6 PFAS compounds over 14 weeks has been
reported(Table4).
Future Prospects and Conclusion
Using a single bioremediation approach for PFAS may not
be successful duet to the process is very slow therefore using
a combination of bioremediation techniques to maximize the
remediation of PFAS may oﬀer a better approach ( Ji et al.,
2020).
In one study, a combination of phytoremediation
and PF
AS-degrading bacteria in a constructed wetland was
recommended as an eﬀective and environmentally friendly
approach that integrates optimum physio-chemical conditions
and enhanced microbial degradation. The eﬀectiveness of this
“treatment train” approach has previously been reported in
removing several emerging contaminants, such as pesticides,
pharmaceutical and personal care products (Lv et al., 2016; Liu
etal.,
2019).
Constructed wetland
s consist of three main components
which are substrates, plants and microorganisms. The substrate,
such as biochar, works as an absorbent of long-chain PFAS
as well as media for plant growth and provides surface area
for microbial bioﬁlm production (Yang et al., 2018). Plants are
another
essential component of the constructed wetlands due
to their ability to accumulate PFAS in diﬀerent plant parts,
including leaves and roots tissues (Zhang et al., 2019). Plant
and sub
strate disposal, however, remains a great challenge.
Thus, thermal treatment could be required for the complete
mineralizationofadsorbed andbioaccumulatedPFAS( Gagliano
etal.,
2020).Microorganismsarethemostimportantcomponent
of t
he wetland; however, the indigenous microbes have limited
abilitytobiodegradePFAS.Theintroductionofmicroorganisms
that can degrade a certain contaminant has been proven to
enhance the biodegradation of several emerging contaminants,
such as antibiotics and personal care products (Li et al., 2019).
Therefore
, the introduction of deﬂuorinating microorganisms
that can use methane and hydrogen as an electron donor,
to the constructed wetlands could enhance the breakdown of
the C-F bond and the biodegradation of PFAS compounds
(Huang and Jaﬀé, 2019). However, further investigation is
required to
assess the eﬀectiveness of this approach ( Ji et al.,
2020).

bioaccumulation, biodegradation and bio-adsorption.
However
, to date, most of the studies that have been
conducted on microalgal-bioremediation are laboratory-
based experiments under control conditions and the
transition to ﬁeld applications remains a challenge.
Therefore, further research is required to employ microalgal
species to bioremediate PFAS, which demonstrate
increased biodegradation potential (Sutherland and Ralph,
2019).
T
he ot
her role that microalgae may play in remediating
emerging contaminants is enhancing bacterial biodegradation.
Microalgal cells provide oxygen, an essential electron acceptor,
viaphotosynthesisfortheaerobicbacterialspecies,whichinturn,
produces CO 2which is required for microalgal photosynthesis
(Sutherland et al., 2015). Microalgae release dissolved organic
matter (DOM)
which can biostimulate bacterial degradation
of the contaminants although the mechanism for the bacterial
biostimulation is not fully understood. Thus, investigating
the relationship between microalgae and bacteria and the
optimum physico-chemical conditions are crucial steps to
enhance the bioremediation process (Sutherland and Ralph,
2019).
Both
fungal and bacterial strains have been isolated that
are capable of degrading PFAS; however, degradation is
slow and incomplete. In addition, information regarding the
biodegradation and bioaccumulation of PFAS using bacteria
and fungi is limited. Thus, more research needs to be
undertaken. This is a crucial limitation to the development of
any robust bioremediation strategy. However, with the current
array of approaches and tools available to microbial ecologists,
includingstableisotopeprobing,metagenomics,transcriptomics
and metabolomics, the identiﬁcation of degradative pathways
and the subsequent harnessing of PFAS-exposed microbial
communities for remediation remains a possibility and further
work needs to be performed to underpin the degradation
process. Further studies could lead to an understanding ofthe pathways of degradation, by comparison to proposed
published pathways in soil, for example (Liu and Avendano,
2013).
In turn, the possible enzymes involved in degrading
PFA
S can be inferred by comparing the structures of PFAS
in the proposed pathways. It would also be of value to list
the potential genes in key bacteria that express the types
of enzymes involved in degrading It would be useful to
ﬁnd and characterize microbes in contaminated soils that are
capableofdegradingPFASandtoquantifybioaccumulationand
biomagniﬁcationofPFASintrophiclevelsofmarineecosystems,
in particular, to improve the assessment of health risks in
human consumption of seafood contaminated by PFAS. Stable
isotope probing (SIP) has been an extremely useful tool to
link microbial identity to function; this technique has been
used to elucidate the microbes responsible for the degradation
of a variety of xenobiotics (Dumont and Murrell, 2005). The
tec
hnique can be performed with DNA-SIP (Uhlík et al., 2009)
or RN
A-SIP which has been used during the degradation of
benzene (Aburto, 2007; Aburto and Ball, 2009) and naphthalene
(Huang et al., 2009) in groundwater, phenol in a bioreactor
(Maneﬁeld et al., 2002), phenol in sludge (Sueoka et al.,
2009)
and tetrachloroethene in river sediments (Kittelmann and
Friedrich,
2008) among other types of studies involving trophic
interactions,
biogeochemicalprocessesorecosystemfunctioning
(Gutierrez-Zamora and Maneﬁeld, 2010). More recently it has
been used
to identify pesticide degraders (Jiang et al., 2018)
and 1-4
dioxane degraders (Aoyagi et al., 2018). Therefore,
SIP is
a powerful technique that can also be combined with
metagenomics (Vo et al., 2007) and transcriptomics (Lueders
et al.,
2016) and could also aid during the bioremediation
ofPF
AS.
Metagenomics is a valuable tool that has been used recently
to assess the stress of polyﬂuorinated alkyl substances on the
microbial community (Cai et al., 2020) as well as their dynamics
andstructure
(Zhang et al., 2020) in diﬀerent environments
such
as soil and freshwater ponds. It is also one of the tools of

synthetic biology (synbio) which has been recently proposed to
help in
the bioremediation of xenobiotics, among them PFAS
(Rylott and Bruce, 2020). Systems biology and protein design
will also
be critical tools for synbio, that in the future should
allow the synthesis of proteins by reprogramming the genetic
code and aid in the remediation of the persistent contaminants
(RylottandBruce,2020).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Synthetic organic compounds (SOCs) are reported as xenobiotics compounds
contaminating the environment from various sources including waste from the pulp and
paper industries: Since the demand and production of paper is growing increasingly,
the release of paper and pulp industrial waste consisting of SOCs is also increasing
the SOCs’ pollution in natural reservoirs to create environmental pollution. In pulp
and paper industries, the SOCs viz. phenol compounds, furans, dioxins, benzene
compounds etc. are produced during bleaching phase of pulp treatment and they
are principal components of industrial discharge. This review gives an overview of
various biotechnological interventions for paper mill waste efﬂuent management and
elimination strategies. Further, the review also gives the insight overview of various ways
to restrict SOCs release in natural reservoirs, its limitations and integrated approaches
for SOCs bioremediation using engineered microbial approaches. Furthermore, it gives
a brief overview of the sustainable remediation of SOCs via genetically modiﬁed
biological agents, including bioengineering system innovation at industry level before
waste discharge.
Keywords: synthetic organic compounds, bioremediation, xenobiotics, pollution, pulp and paper industry
INTRODUCTION
The paper and pulp industry consumes various raw materials i.e., wood, cellulose-based
products, etc. The main aim of the paper and pulp industry is to produce on large scale
to ﬁgure out the demand. This review insight into the environmental pollution caused by
SOCs produced at various processing stages (Table 1). Deforestation for wood has caused
a decline in oxygen level worldwide, directly responsible for ﬂoods and droughts. Water
pollution by waste discharge from pulp industries also contaminates the water bodies with
dissolved organic compounds (DOCs), synthetic organic compounds (SOCs), and suspended
particles (Gupta and Gupta, 2019; Ramírez-García et al., 2019). The organic compounds
reaching humans via water consumption leads to health issues, which are not immediate
but show long term eﬀects. The waste discharge also disturbs aquatic life (Karbalaei et al.,
2018; Gupta et al., 2019). The emission of harmful chemicals and gases i.e., sulfur dioxide,
nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide will cause acid rain as they are water-soluble and reaches
the water bodies indirectly (Gupta and Shukla, 2020). Metlymercaptans, hydrogen sulﬁdes,

and dimethyl sulﬁdes along with volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) lead to air and water pollution (Singh and Chandra, 2019;
Pino-Cortés et al., 2020). The trials for pollution prevention are
in continuous use by industries (by use of alternative bleaching
agents), environmentalist (by releasing norms) as well as by
consumers (by recycling waste and use of sedimentation tanks).
Still, these measures are not fulﬁlling the demand to degrade
the SOCs waste from the paper and pulp industry (Zumstein
et al., 2018; Liu, 2020). In recent reports, the researchers have
shown their interest in the biotechnological advancements for
degrading the pollutants (Ellouze and Sayadi, 2016; Tripathi
et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2020). This review covers the
advancement in methodologies via engineered biological agents
(mainly bacteria) that are reviewed and suggested for sustainable
bioremediation of SOCs.
SOCs FROM PAPER INDUSTRY WASTES
An ecosystem polluted and damaged by human activities
with increasing intensity becomes a primarily global problem.
SOCs are of xenobiotic origin in nature and thus there are
diﬃculties involved in biotransformation (Antizar-Ladislao
and Galil, 2004; Kumar et al., 2019). Due to recalcitrant, it
has ecotoxic eﬀects on the biosphere. SOCs can be primarily
produced by following compounds such as methane, ethylene,
aliphatics, and aromatics. Among the above, most of the
industrial important SOCs derived from the aromatics viz.,
ethylbenzene, xylene, benzene, and toluene (Fang et al., 2018).
Based on their primary uses SOCs are mainly classiﬁed such
as cyclic, acyclic, aromatics, or aliphatics. SOCs contain huge
categories like volatile organics carbons (VOCs), and relatively
emerging organic contaminants (EOCs). VOCs primarily
contain industrial re-solvents, gasolene agents, trihalomethanes,
etc., while EOCs have pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting
substances, hormones, food additives, microplastics, etc.
(Lapworth et al., 2012; Postigo and Barceló, 2015). SOCs are
primarily present in wastewater treatment plants. Most ofthe SOCs pass througfh various photo-transformations or
chemical reactions and many of them remain inert in an open
environment system.
In the paper mill, SOCs are released during the pulping and
papermaking process. Chlorine and its derivatives have been
released and restrained as adsorbable organic halides (AOX)
(Savant et al., 2006), while other xenobiotic agents (resin acids,
chlorinated lignins, dioxins, phenolic (tannins), and furans) are
produced via pulping and paper manufacturing (Chandra et al.,
2011). Out of the above, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and
dibenzodioxins compounds of furans and dioxins are notably
resistant to degradation and are persistent in nature (Gupta
and Shukla, 2020). The polar phenolic polymeric compounds
(tannins) are released in wastewater during the debarking process
of raw wood material, which creates 50% COD of this wastewater
(Chandra et al., 2018). Another study revealed that the naturally
occurring tricyclic diterpenes (resin acids) are released during
the pulping operations, which have pathetic aqua-phobic acids
and toxicity levels to aquatic animals at conc. of 200–800 mg/l
in wastewater (Duan et al., 2020). Mainly resin acids are
produced from the pulping process containing dehydroabietic
acid, abietic acid, pimaric acid, isopimaric acid, levopimaric
acid, and neoabietic acid (Y adav and Chandra, 2018). Out of
all the resin acids, isopimaric acid is notable as highly toxic.
Many SOCs are discharged into the water body during the
chemical process like calendaring (coating for paper smoothness)
in the paper manufacturing industry. The schematic diagram
of pulp processes releasing SOCs is given in Figure 1. The
dioxins and furans are also released when chlorine reacts with
some defoamers and wood preservatives like pentachlorophenol
(PCP) during the pulping, washing and pulp bleaching process
(Badar and Farooqi, 2012). Additionally, most SOCs that are
discharged from the bleaching process areditolyethane, bis
(methylphenoxy) ethane, di-iso-propyl naphthalene, terphenyl,
chloromethyl-phenoxy-methyl-phenyl-ethane, etc. (Singh and
Chandra, 2019). There are a lot of dyes used for paper printing
in paper mills. At the end result, approximately 200 billion
liters of dye eﬄuents are released based on fabric type and dye

used. Many researchers reported that synthetic organic dyes such
as azo, phthalocyanine and anthraquinone dyes discharged as
eﬄuents in the water body and have the most toxic eﬀect on the
environment as well as human health (Tkaczyk et al., 2020).
Ways to Restrain SOCs Production as
Waste
To evaluate and mitigate the hazardous eﬀect and load of
SOCs released from the pulp and paper industries into the
environment, various processes such as the use of chlorine-free
bleaching process, use of ecofriendly chemicals for pulping, use of
enzymatic pulping, and bleaching instead of the chemical pulping
and bleaching process have been used. Among these, several other
advanced and more signiﬁcant methods have been adopted to
reduce the SOCs load into wastewater, which is discussed below.
Many researchers have adopted many signiﬁcant and
ecological important methods help to remove organic pollutants
from the environment, viz adsorption, biodegradation, striping,
hydrolysis, photolysis, etc. (Ali et al., 2012). But signiﬁcant
results have not yet been obtained. Additionally, conventional
adsorption techniques integrated with post-treatment using
granular activated carbon (GAC) have been globally adopted
for the removal of AOX for pulp mill wastewater. According
to Osman et al. (2013), the treatment of paper mill wastewater
GAC used with a sequenced batch bioﬁlm reactor (GACSBBR)
has signiﬁcant capability to remove AOX at the longest hydraulic
retention time (HRT) (Farooqi and Basheer, 2017). Currently,
researchers have revealed that the use of biochar adsorptionto mitigate organic pollutants has become an interesting ﬁeld
of research and hotspot. Biochar has a porous structure and
contains functional groups of oxygen and minerals (Weber and
Quicker, 2018). To eliminate dyes, these dyes go to diﬀerent
types of the treatment process (Puzyn and Mostrag, 2012). The
biological, chemical, and physical processes can be done based
on wastewater treatment stages (Primary, secondary and tertiary
treatment) (Samer, 2015). The removal of organic and inorganic
solids takes place in the primary treatment via sedimentation,
grinding, and ﬂocculation. While in the biological treatments
(secondary treatment), organic materials are used by the
aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms by the means of biological
oxidation and biosynthesis processes. In the tertiary treatment,
the wastewater undergoes diﬀerent treatment processes like
advanced oxidation processes, ion exchange, adsorption and
reverse osmosis processes. For example, many researchers used
ferric oxide-biochar nanocomposite absorbent extracted from
paper mill sludge (Chaukura et al., 2017).
Another study reported/investigated that the biochar can
be prepared from cardboard (BCPD), pig manure (BC-PM),
and pinewood (BC-PW) for the use in adsorption of various
synthetic organic dyes within several pyrolysis terms. Due to high
ash content, BC-PM showed signiﬁcant adsorption properties
(Lonappan et al., 2016). Adsorption methods are amongst
those used to remove dyes in comparison with other methods
(Srivastava et al., 2018). During the degradation process of
synthetic organic dyes, it undergoes various transformations
kinetics. Some of the changes are into the more toxic agents
and some of them non-toxic agents. Advanced techniques such

Jaiswal et al. Synthetic Organic Compounds (SOCs) From Paper Industry Wastes
as oxygen cooking techniques, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone
treatment for the pulp bleaching process could be options for
pretreatment of primary sludge wastes, which helps with the
reduction of an environmental load of SOCs production. There
are mostly two types of chemical pretreatment used, alkaline and
acidic. Acidic pretreatment is promoted for the hemicellulose
while alkaline pretreatment for the lignocellulose, which makes
it more accessible to use their products (Hendriks and Zeeman,
2009). However, lots of modiﬁed methods have been used for the
pulping and bleaching process of the pulp mill. Bio-pulping is
most suitable for the pulping process using eco-friendly enzymes
and it can reduce the production of SOCs in waste materials.
Some other techniques like innovation in the bleaching process
can be adopted by many researchers. These techniques are
elemental chlorine-free (ECF) bleaching techniques and a totally
chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching technique (Gupta et al., 2019).
Detection and Analysis
Gas chromatography (GC) and Gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC/MS) have been used to detect and analyze the
SOCs eﬄuent released from the pulp and paper industries. Some
metabolites formed by degradation of AOX can be identiﬁed
by using GC/MS (Pronk et al., 2015). Many researchers used
a multi X2500 analyzer to characterize bleaching AOX eﬄuent.
A study has stated that organic chlorides were recognized
by using GC-MS incorporation with or without hot water
abstraction. By these methods, AOXs were categorized into
at least four main components such as macromolecular, small
molecular organic chloride, chloro-phenol and chlorobenzene.
Although, these methods are conventional methods and are time-
consuming and expensive. Nowadays, advanced technologies
like biosensors have been used, which oﬀer an advantage over
classical analytical methods due to their selectivity, sensitivity,
eco-friendly, inexpensiveness and short assay time (Y ao et al.,
2017). However, an immobilized laccase based biosensor has
been used for the detection and analysis of organic compounds.
Several other electrochemical biosensors such as voltammetric
sensor, amperometric laccase biosensor and optical biosensors
are used for the analytical analysis of various organic eﬄuents
released from industrial operations. Among these, amperometric
transducer methods have been reported as widely studied and
used in laccase biosensors, while presently optical biosensors have
the most signiﬁcant results in terms of sensitivity (Rodríguez-
Delgado et al., 2015). Additionally, a nanomaterial-based (Pena-
Pereira et al., 2020) colorimetric detector has been used for
the quantitative analysis of low molecular weight gaseous
VOCs (Azzouz et al., 2019). Some researchers have employed
high-temperature combustion to the transformation of Total
organic halides (TOX) into halides and detected and quantiﬁed
these halides using micro-coulometry methods. In 1977, micro-
coulometry titration methods have been replaced by the more
reliable ion-selective electrode (ISE) to detect the halides present
in the wastes released from the paper mill (Chen et al., 2020).
Limitations and Challenges
SOCs such as aromatic compounds (phenols and biphenyls),
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pyrene), are generallydischarged into the water bodies. Most of the SOCs found
in the environment/wastewater are recalcitrant due to their
complexity compared to other eﬄuents. However, these
eﬄuents have drawn more attention to treatment systems.
These compounds are highly persistent, more toxic compounds
that remain over a long period and bio-accumulated into
the water body. Separation and treatment of these eﬄuents
became mandatory before releasing eﬄuents in the marine
ecosystem. For this purpose, the development of eﬃcient
techniques has been an interesting area of research for a long
time (Awad et al., 2019). The use of conventional technologies
has many disadvantages that limit the application area. The main
environmental impact is the production of a huge amount of
hazardous sludge that creates dumping problems and increases
toxicity concentration in treated water (Ashraﬁ et al., 2013).
Traditional methods are more expensive than advanced methods.
However, environmental and health costs are also aﬀected by
using this classical method. Gaseous emissions, wastewater
and sludge production from eﬄuent treatments are relatively
unmonitored. In developing countries, these eﬄuents are
primarily disposed of into unsecured landﬁlls. The hazardous
agents leach out over a long period from the landﬁlls and go
directly or indirectly into the environment. Constraints are
in place with the purpose of limiting these eﬀects, which have
been mandatory across industries (Nimkar, 2017). However,
the challenges of the reduction of SOCs production are still
under investigation. Researchers have used some innovative and
modiﬁed technologies for the treatment process of wastewater
to help in the mitigation of hazardous compounds in the
environment. Mostly SOCs are derived from the aromatic
source, viz., toluene, ethylbenzene, anthracene, etc., which are
persistent over the period and recalcitrant in the ecosystem
because of the rigidness of their molecular structure and present
thermodynamically stable aromatic ring (Postigo and Barceló,
2015). The ecotoxic impacts of SOCs on the environment have
been accepted and implicit. However, water scarcity, water
pollution and water recycling are serious challenges globally
(Jain et al., 2020).
Economical Importance and Hindrance
by SOCs for the Paper Industry
Pulp and paper are produced from cellulosic ﬁbers, other plant
material and synthetic materials may be used. Papers are mainly
derived from wood ﬁbers but cotton liners, bagasse, rags, etc
are also used in some papers (Bajpai, 2018). Pulp and paper
mills waste material and used papers can be further recycled
and used to create economical values. The pulp and paper
mills librated a substantial amount of wastewater composed of
organic material such as high cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin
contents (Kaur et al., 2020). Lignins are cross-linked phenolic
polymers. These organic materials are suitable for the derivation
of glucose and other fermentable sugars for example galactose,
mannose, arabinose, and xylose. By using physical and chemical
treatment methods, transformation of paper industry sludge
into a glucose-rich liquid can be achieved. Enzymatic hydrolysis
is a promising approach for the derivation of sugars from

Jaiswal et al. Synthetic Organic Compounds (SOCs) From Paper Industry Wastes
paper industry sludge. Other valuable products can be obtained
by causing the fermentation of sugars (Naicker et al., 2020).
Production of biofuels such as bioethanol could be successfully
achieved by the conversion of pulp and paper industry waste
mainly composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents.
These components require a series of reaction steps such as
hydrolysis, hydrogeoxygenation alkylation, etc to be converted
into biofuel. Lignin based biofuels can be produced by using
one-pot depolymerization or by the upgrading of bio-oil
from biomass decomposition. Pulp and paper industry waste
conversion into biofuel is an interesting approach to manage
paper industry waste and to create commercial value out of it
(Zhu et al., 2020). The paper industry also generated sludge
composed of biomass ﬂy ash and calcareous sludge that is
commonly disposed of in landﬁlls. Calcareous sludge can be
used in the manufacturing of green geopolymeric mortars for
the application in construction. These components are released
during the Kraft process of lignin. Biomass ﬂy ash was reused
as an alternative source of silica and aluminum, and calcareous
sludge mainly constituting of calcite, was recycled and used
in GP mortars construction. The implemented Mix design
was outlined to maximize the incorporation of the calcareous
sludge and improve the mortar’s mechanical performance (Saeli
et al., 2020). To accomplish a productive re-utilization of waste
generated from the paper industry, waste eﬄuent was recycled
and used to produce green-composites with high strength
which depends on ultra-molecular weight polyethylene, high-
density polyethylene, and low-density polyethylene. The three
green-composites were developed by an extrusion and injection
molding named PLC, PUC, and PHC composites. The maleic
anhydride grafted polyethylene, an organic compound, was used
as a compatibilizer for preparing composites. The utilization
of paper mill waste avoids the environmental waste and also
produces the green-composites (Zhang et al., 2020). Anaerobic
digestion under mesophilic condition is widely applied for
the production of biogas by utilizing waste rich in suspended
organic materials liberated from the paper industry. Industry
waste contains a very high level of COD and BOD due
to the presence of lignin, fatty acids, tannins, resin acids,
and chlorinated compounds, etc. This bioﬁlm technology is
highly eﬀective in biogas production (Bakraoui et al., 2020).
Biogas production can be successfully achieved by using UASB
digester technology and it can be applied on a large and
small scale. Anaerobic digestion of Recycled pulp and paper
industry waste can be carried out at diﬀerent organic loading
rates and in mesophilic conditions (Bakraoui et al., 2020). The
amount of lignin is very important in paper manufacturing
because lignin will aﬀect the properties of the resultant paper.
Lignin amount inﬂuences the tensile strength and elongation of
cellulose ﬁber.
Effect on Ecological and Biological
Health
The production of SOCs comes from mainly the pulping and
bleaching stage of the pulp mill. These compounds have toxicproperties, which may cause carcinogenic disease, allergic and
dermatic disease (Puzyn and Mostrag, 2012). The production of
trichlorotrihydroxybenzenes and bromomethylpropanylbenzene
in the spent bleach liquor from pulp and paper industries have
mutagenicity eﬀects on the aquatic body as well as human
beings. Additionally, some other SOCs such as chlorophenols
and chloroguaiacols from bleach eﬄuents notably carcinogen,
reproductive toxicity in ﬁsh, and estrogenic in humans. Further,
it has acute toxicity, which prevents the ATP synthesis process
and oxidative phosphorylation mechanism (Singh and Chandra,
2019). Some endocrine-disrupting chemicals as residual organic
compounds showed chromosomal aberration in marine animals
(Chandra et al., 2018). The discharge of black liquor containing
SOCs into the environment causes a direct eﬀect on ﬂora and
fauna. In a developing country, untreated wastewater released
from pulp and paper industries is discharged into the water
body (Duan et al., 2020). They have to use this water for
irrigation purposes so a lot of hazardous chemicals come into
the ﬁelds and aﬀected the crops due to changes to the soil
properties, like alteration in pH values and beneﬁcial microbes
(Nguyen et al., 2020). The organic compounds pass through
diﬀerent trophic levels in the marine ecosystem and are bio-
accumulated at a diﬀerent level, which can be harmful to
marine animals. However, the use of biochar for the adsorption
of SOCs helps to retain fertilizers in the soil, promoting soil
fertility, removal of heavy metals and acids, etc. (Shiralian,
2016). Based on dissipation time, SOCs can be classiﬁed into
three main categories: highly persistent, moderately persistent,
and low persistent. Humans are more exposed to SOCs
through polluted air, water, or soil (Bilal and Iqbal, 2019).
SOCs combined with their precursors employ eco-toxic eﬀects
on the environment (Figure 2; Jaishankar et al., 2014). An
experiment was conducted which reported that the eﬀect of
SOCs on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the rivers
of Chile, Canada, and Argentina was observed as stimuli for
the development of secondary sexual properties and enhanced
the intersex features in the young rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) (Chiang et al., 2015). Similarly, a study conducted in
China (2018) reported that long term exposure of andostenrdione
has masculinization and reproductive eﬀects in both male and
female wastern mosquitoﬁsh (Gambusiaaﬃnis) (Hou et al., 2018).
Another experiment demonstrated by terasaki and co-workers
in 2012 stated that the eﬀects of Dimethyldiphenylmethane
and di-iso-propylnaphthalene have reproductive and tissue
toxicity on marine ﬁsh (Terasaki et al., 2012). The exposure
of hexachlorobutadine (HCBD) in human beings has hostile
eﬀects on human health either directly or metabolically. The
nephrotoxicity eﬀects of HCBD have been observed in animal
host experiments and reported as having a necrosis eﬀect on
the renal proximal tubule, up-regulation of kidney injuring
molecule-1 and lipid peroxidation in renal cells (Sadeghnia
et al., 2013). In china, the approximately 8.0 10 6mg/kg/day
of HCBD exposure dose for human and animal risk was
observed which has caused skin diseases, carcinogenicity, sexual
abbreviation and mutagenicity in humans as well as aquatic
communities (Zhang et al., 2014).

BIOTECHNOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS
IN PRESERVING ENVIRONMENT
THROUGH BIOREMEDIATION
The recalcitrant nature and toxicological assessment of synthetic
organic compounds were not carried out at the early industrial
stage. But as the industrialization sector boomed and ill-eﬀects
of various pollutants were studied then SOCs also came under
scrutiny because of their presence in polluted industrial water.
Since then it has become a matter of great concern to remediate
these pollutants. Various biological and technological approaches
have been utilized to remove SOCs from wastewater before their
discharge into water bodies (Jain et al., 2020).
Bioelectrochemical systems, containing electro genesis
systems, electro hydro-genesis systems, microbial
electrosynthesis (MES) systems (Liu et al., 2018), and microbial
desalination systems, are an emerging technology to remediate
pollutants (Wang et al., 2015; Fernando et al., 2019). This
technology uses electricity and microorganisms to degrade
pollutants into less toxic elements. Certain value added products
such as biofuels (including hydrogen, butanol, and ethanol,
etc.) (Kondaveeti et al., 2019; Liu and Yu, 2020), acetates, andmetals are also produced by using these techniques (Moscoviz
et al., 2016; Maktabifard et al., 2018). The relatively low energy
value (0.2–0.8 V) is needed for the MEC system as compared to
conventional water electrolysis (Kadier et al., 2016). Rozendal and
co-workers reported that approximately 7 kg COD/m3bioreactor
volume/day could be removed by the BES which is the same as a
conventional treatment system (Rozendal et al., 2008). Lab scale
results reported that MEC showed COD removal eﬃciency was
observed to be about 90–97% of synthetic wastewater at diﬀerent
temperature proﬁle (ranging 5–23C) and 0.6 kWh/kg electricity.
Hence, the BSE is more suitable for small and lab scale systems
due to the low energy utilization with improved byproduct
production which minimizes the capital cost (Tartakovsky et al.,
2018). But the implementation of BES with ordinary systems
at industrial levels is more challenging due to the high capital
cost which is required (Santoro et al., 2017). Microbial fuel
cells (MFCs) are eﬃcient for the biochemical conversion of
energy for a useful purpose. Dual-chamber MFC has been
utilized for the management of polyaromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) contagion from diesel. The proposed system detached
82% of PAHs and generated about 31 mW/m2power. MFCs
with tubular single- and dual- chambers were applied to reveal

Jaiswal et al. Synthetic Organic Compounds (SOCs) From Paper Industry Wastes
ex situ and in situ management of reﬁnery wastewater or
groundwater having a blend of PAHs, containing benzene
and phenanthrene (Adelaja et al., 2017). Fenton reaction and
the microbial consortium was evaluated for the removal of
tannery dye eﬄuent. This exceptional combination was able to
remove 89.5% pollutants and led to a reduction in the COD
level of 93.7% (Shanmugam et al., 2019). Another advanced
oxidation process of ultraﬁltration and photoelectrolysis alone
was found to remove total phosphorus between 90 and 97%
from municipal wastewater and 44% from industrial wastewater
(Gray et al., 2020).
Activated carbon has been used as a suitable adsorbent for
many pollutants. Superﬁne powdered activated carbon is found
to be more suitable as an adsorbent due to its smaller size,
lesser surface oxygen amount, bigger aperture diameters, and
neutral pH. An increase in adsorption of planar (phenanthrene)
compounds was aﬀected more than non-planar (2-phenyl
phenol) compounds (Partlan et al., 2020). Activated carbon
can also be used in supporting bioﬁlms for pollutant removal.
Due to the larger surface area provided by activated carbon,
biomass was able to degrade xylene and other BTEX compounds
eﬃciently and reduce the toxicity of up to 99% (Mello et al.,
2019). In this era of machine learning, modeling strategy to
check the eﬃcient substrates of adsorption of SOCs can help
in the development of eﬃcient adsorbents. In a study, Ghosh
et al. (2019) developed a regression support model quantitative
structure-property relationship (QSPR). According to this model,
they have calculated the adsorption coeﬃcient of 40 SOCs
on single-walled carbon nanotubes. They found that various
hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions as well as hydrogen
bonding help in the adsorption of SOCs on nanotubes. The
interaction studies help in the development of suitable adsorbent
for SOCs removal from wastewater (Ghosh et al., 2019).
Modiﬁed zeolites are also emerging as suitable adsorbents for
wastewater treatment. Hashemi et al. (2019) modiﬁed a zeolite
Y made from bentonite by using CTAB. Various adsorptionisotherms indicated removal of 89% total organic carbon
and involvement of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions
(Hashemi et al., 2019). Another Fe-nano zeolite was able to
absorb phenol (Ph), 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) and 2-nitrophenol
(2-NP) in the amount of 138.7, 158.9, and 171.2 mg/g,
respectively. This zeolite-based adsorbent was even more cost
eﬀective than activated carbon (Tri et al., 2020).
SUSTAINABLE REMEDIATION OF SOCs
VIA GENETICALLY MODIFIED
BIOLOGICAL AGENTS
In the pulp and paper industry paper is derived from wood
and produces a huge amount of waste eﬄuents as sludge
and polluted water. Toxic chemicals and recalcitrant organic
compounds are found in this wastewater (Dixit et al., 2020).
Pulp and paper industry waste released into freshwater alters
aquatic habitats and adversely impacts human health. The
remediation of these organic compounds is necessary to
accomplish environmental sustainability. Bioremediation of
pollutants is a novel technique to make the eﬄuents less toxic
and safe for discarding the waste (Gupta et al., 2019). To protect
human lives, the advancement of remediation technologies
for the recovery of polluted sites is of utmost importance.
Sustainable remediation, which seeks to reduce concentrations
to risk-based levels as well as mitigate ancillary environmental
consequences such as waste generation, has recently gained
signiﬁcance (Cecchin et al., 2017). Bioremediation requires the
use of particular microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants,
a reasonable and eﬃcient approach based on microbes’ unique
catabolic capacity (Dvo ˇrák et al., 2017). This has led to increased
eﬀorts using innovative biotechnological methods (Table 2) to
develop more eﬀective, ecologically sustainable, environmentally
acceptable, and cost-eﬀective remediation technologies (Kumar
et al., 2017). Various microorganisms, mainly bacteria and

Jaiswal et al. Synthetic Organic Compounds (SOCs) From Paper Industry Wastes
fungi, play an important role to degrade synthetic organic
compounds. Degradation of these compounds depends upon
the secretion of enzymes by microorganisms that participate
in the metabolic pathways. The traditional physicochemical
bioremediation methods (in situ and ex situ) (Jaiswal et al., 2020)
are ineﬃcient for degradation and removal of new emerged
compounds (Jaiswal and Shukla, 2020). With the development
of genetic engineering and Recombinant DNA technology many
genetically modiﬁed microorganisms were constructed by using
various techniques for the remediation of synthetic organic
compounds (Liu et al., 2019). Biodegradation of recalcitrant azo
dye was successfully done by enzyme azoreductase encoded by
gene azoA from Enterococcus sp. L2 into E. coli and Pseudomonas
ﬂuorescens using the expression vector PBBRMCS2. To further
increase the degradation of azo dye NADH regenerate system
depended on the formate dehydrogenase enzyme introduced
into the host strain by the overexpression of fdh gene from
Mycobacterium vacccae N10. For eﬃcient dye decolorization
processes the transcription fusion of azoA –fdh provided a
simple genetic cassette for genetic engineering of an appropriate
host (Rathod et al., 2017). Moreover, Biodegradation of phenoland p-nitrophenol was successfully done by genetically modiﬁed
Bacillus cereus strains by introducing the vgbgene from Vitrocilla
stercoraria. The gene was cloned into a pUB110 multicopy
plasmid. A higher degradation rate was obtained at 37C under
aerobic conditions by genetically modiﬁed bacteria compared
with wild type. p-Nitrophenol degradation was obtained high
by using the strain with uni-copy of vgbgene (Vélez-Lee et al.,
2016). Bacillus cereus and its recombinant strains are eﬀectively
used for biodegradation of phenols and p-nitrophenol under
anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Diﬀerent Phenolic compounds
are eﬀectively degraded by the action of Manganese peroxidase,
an extracellular heme enzyme of white-rot basidiomycete
Ganoderma. 1092 bp full-length cDNA of the MnP gene,
designated as G. lucidum MnP (GluMnP1), was cloned from
G. lucidum and a eukaryotic expression vector, pAO815: GlMnP
was constructed and transferred it into the methylotrophic

GluMnP1. Phenol and the main oxidation degradation products
including hydroquinone, pyrocatechol, and resorcinol were
analyzed by using HPLC (Xu et al., 2017). In another study
for the remediation of the phenolic compound engineered
Escherichia coli eﬀectively used. Nine genes namely, pheA1,
pheA2, catA, catB, catC, catD, pcaI, pcaJ, and pcaF were selected
from diﬀerent microorganisms and an oligonucleotide was
synthesized. By using the modiﬁed overlap-extension PCR
method, all synthesized genes were seamlessly connected
with the T7 promoter and terminator to construct a gene
expression cassette. All the cassettes were transformed to the host
Escherichia coli strain BL221-AI and the transformant was named
BL-phe/cat. The engineered Escherichia coli was eﬀectively used
for phenol degradation (Wang et al., 2019). Degradation of
organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids was achieved by
engineering Pseudomonas putida. In a study, a scarless genome-
editing tool was applied for the engineering of Pseudomonas
putida KT2440. The vgb and gfp genes were transferred into
the chromosome. It was observed that the genetically modiﬁed
strain Pseudomonas putida KTUe having genes (1phaC1, 1vdh,
1algA/algF, 1fcs,1upp, 1phaZ/phaC2, gfp+, mcd+, cehA+,
mpd+, pytH+, vgb+) was able to decompose all the pesticides
screened. Also, it was found that to sequester oxygen in the soil
study with the VHb gene was responsible. Thus, this engineered
Pseudomonas putida strain is a powerful approach for the
degradation of pesticides (Gong et al., 2018). Recent genetic
editing technology is a promising approach for engineering the
various microorganisms to perform remediation of pollutants
(Dangi et al., 2019). With the help of gene-editing techniques,
modiﬁed microorganisms with maximum quality can be
produced by making targeted modiﬁcations in the genome using
molecular scissors involving engineered nucleases. Clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR-Cas),
zinc ﬁnger nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription-activators like
eﬀector nucleases (TALENs) are the main gene-editing tools that
have the dynamic capacity to boost bioremediation of synthetic
pesticides (Jaiswal and Shukla, 2020; Kumari and Chaudhary,
2020). The gene editing process involves self-designed guide
sequences that are inserted complementary to the sequence
of the gene of interest assisting break at a site, repaired by
homologous recombination, insertion, or deletion of desired
sequence fragments. A double-stranded (DSB) break can be
created by Transcription-activators like eﬀector nucleases in the
target sequence on DNA and makes sticky ends. Likewise, zinc
ﬁnger nucleases also introduce a DSB in the target sequence
of the host genome. On another hand, CRISPR-Cas comprise
of crRNA and trcRNA joined by gRNA. gRNA controls the
Cas9 enzyme to create DSB in the desired sequences of DNA
(Jaiswal et al., 2019). In another study plants also play a main
role in the removal of various pollutants by phytoremediation.
Phytoremediation is a bioremediation form that requires
plants as tools for the removal of hazardous contaminants
from the environment. Phytostimulation, phytoextraction,
phytoextraction, phytostabilization, and phytovolatilization are
diﬀerent approaches of phytoremediation for the remediation of
metals/metalloids and other hazardous contaminants. A plant’s
genome can be modiﬁed by utilizing CRISPR-Cas, ZFNs, andTALENs gene-editing tools (Figure 3; Aminedi et al., 2020).
Indeed, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeat (CRISPR-Cas) is a revolutionary genetic engineering
tool in plants that provides a pragmatic approach to synthesize
advanced phenotypes (Saxena et al., 2020). On another hand,
progress in the development of recombinant microorganisms has
created potential risks associated with the release into the open
environment of such genetically engineered microorganisms
(GEMs). But many attempts are being made to monitor and
track genetically engineered microorganisms to address these
risks. Designing genetically engineered microorganisms by
employing suﬃcient genetic methods to contain the bacterial
system will help to reduce the anticipated hazards. For example,
transposition vectors are designed which are deemed to be safe
in the environment. Another containment technique primarily
includes the production of suicidal genetically engineered
microorganisms, but the technology has yet to be applied.
These advanced technologies are one of the most promising
ways to mitigate the adverse eﬀects of genetically engineered
microorganisms release in the open environment (Hussain
et al., 2018). But certain risks could also exist and further
study will then be needed to produce acceptable technical
regulatory guidelines.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVE
The review shows the extent that the recent research in the
ﬁeld of environmental pollution by the paper and pulp industry
has reached. The researchers and environmentalists concluded
that SOCs pollutant levels must be declined, and have worked
in the same direction. They found that the composition of
various chemicals varies with the stage and methodologies
applied for paper production. The detection and degradation
of organic chemicals produced during paper production
are enhanced by researchers using advanced techniques.
Biotechnological intervention using synthetic and systems
biology for producing genetically modiﬁed organisms speciﬁcally
for potential degradation of SOCs came into consideration. Thus,
this review covers the recent reports and methodologies used by
the researcher for environmental sustainability.

tothepresenceofseveralorganicpollutants,suchasalcohols,ketones,aldehydes,and
fatty acids. The presence of these organics in the process water may lead to adverse
effect on the environment and aquatic life. Thus, it is necessary to reduce the COD
content of GTL process water to an acceptable limit before discharging or reusing the
treatedwater.Duetoseveraladvantages,biologicaltreatmentisoftenutilizedasthemain

to degrade the organic pollutants in GTL process water. In this work, bacterial strains
were isolated from the GTL process water, identiﬁed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing
and then used in the biodegradation process. The detailed identiﬁcation of the strains
conﬁrmed the presence of three organics-degrading bacteria identiﬁed as Alcaligenes
faecalis,Stenotrophomonas sp., andOchrobactrum sp. Furthermore, biodegradation
experiments were carried out and conﬁrmed that the pure culture as well as the mixed
culture consortium of the bacterialstrains has the ability to reduce the organic pollutants
in GTL process water. However, the growth rate and biodegradation efﬁciency depend
on the type of strains and the initial COD content. Indeed, the removal percentage and
growth rate were enhanced after 7 days for all cultures and resulted in COD reduction
up to 60%. Moreover, the mixed culture of bacterial strains can tolerate and treat GTL
process water with a variety of ranges of COD contents.

INTRODUCTION
Qatar is the capital of natural gas production and hosts the largest gas-to-liquid (GTL) plant in
the world. During the GTL process, considerable amounts of water are often generated, due to
the chemistry nature of the Fischer–Tropsch (F-T) process that is the main process in natural gas
plants. The generated GTL process water contains several dissolved hydrocarbons that cannot be

directly used or discharged to the aquatic environment. GTL
proces
s water is characterized by high acidity and high chemical
oxygendemand(COD)contentthatcanreach32,000mg/L.The
water is mainly contaminated with non-acid oxygenated (NAO)
hydrocarbons,includingketones,aldehydes,alcohols,ethers,and
esters (Zacharia et al., 2018). Thus, an appropriate treatment
proces
sshouldbeappliedtoreducetheconcentrationoforganics
in GTL process water to the acceptable discharge limit. Since
F-T water contains volatile organics and light oxygenates such
as carbonyl compounds and C 1-C3alcohols which have boiling
points less than that of water, they are typically treated using
distillationorstrippingcolumns.Therefore,theGTLwastewater
treatment plant usually requires a pretreatment step such as
stripping or distillation column to reduce the content of COD
before the biological treatment process (Surkatti et al., 2020).

stewatergeneratedfromthestripping/distillationcolumn
still contains large quantities of carboxylic acids and other
oxygenates, which need to be treated biologically ( Enyi et al.,
2013).
T
he conventional
activated sludge process, constructed
wetlands, and trickling ﬁlters are nowadays among the
most common biological technologies for the treatment of
wastewaters, in addition to diﬀerent types of membrane
bioreactors (Shokrollahzadeh et al., 2008). For GTL process
water,
several biological treatments were combined with other
treatment processes to achieve high COD reduction eﬃciency
(Wang et al., 2016). However, the use of traditional anaerobic
suspended slud
ge process has a major limitation in wastewater
treatment.Therefore,newbiologicalreactorsweredevelopedfor
the treatment of industrial wastewater, in which bacterial strains
were used in the form of free or immobilized systems ( El-Naas
etal.,
2013,2016;Bouabidietal.,2019).
In biologic
al treatments, chemo-organotrophic species are
consideredasthemainmicrobialdegradersoforganicpollutants
in contaminated wastewaters (Fritsche and Hofrichter, 2008).
A large
range of organic compounds can be used by these
chemoheterophic microorganisms, especially bacteria, as carbon
and energy sources (Elbeshbishy, 2014). However, searching
to e
xtend the range of the organics that can be used, their
admissible concentrations, and the eﬃciency of their removal
is leading to continuous eﬀorts deployed to isolate new strains
or species having the ability to degrade all organics present in
GTL process water. This is more needed for special situations of
watergeneratedinaridzones,liketheGulfarea,characterizedby
harsh conditions (Disi et al., 2017). Indeed, the selection of any
bacterial
strainforabioremediationprocessisbasedonitsability
to tolerate harsh conditions, exhibiting a suitable activity for the
existingorganicsinthetreatedwater(Azubuikeetal.,2016).Arid
and semiarid
areas are characterized by harsh weather with high
temperatures that can aﬀect bacterial populations and create a
dynamicdiversityofthesebacteria,basedontheirabilitytoadapt
by acquiring new metabolic activities and suitable surfactant
production(Elazzazyetal.,2015).Localbacteriaarethenneeded
for t
he treatment of local GTL process water. Moreover, under
harsh conditions, indigenous microorganisms have adapted to
develop a speciﬁc metabolism, eﬀective for these weatheredorganics (Kumar and Gopal, 2015). Indeed, many failures of
bioremediation applic
ations in areas characterized by harsh
weather and soils can be attributed to the use of unacclimated
bacteriaandtheirassociatedactivities(Disietal.,2017).
The novelty
of this work resides in the collection, isolation,
andidentiﬁcationofindigenousbacteriafromGTLprocesswater
available in Qatar. The same bacterial strains are then utilized
for the biodegradation of major organic contaminants in local
GTL process water. The main approach employed in this work
is multidisciplinary, combining environmental microbiology,
biochemistry, and bioremediation. This is important from
fundamentalandappliedpointsofviewforspeciﬁcGTLprocess
watergeneratedandtreatedatharshconditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Industrial Water Samples
Process water samples were collected from a local GTL plant in
Qatar, in which two types of water samples were analyzed and
referred to as pretreated GTL process water and original GTL
process water. The physical and chemical characteristics of the
GTL process water samples are shown in Table1. GTL process
water is characterized by its high acidity and organic contents
(highCOD).
In order to investigate the organics present in GTL process
water,aqualitativeanalysisusingGC-MSwascarriedoutforthe
GTL process water (6,000 mg/L COD) and for pretreated GTL
process water. In general, GTL process water contains alcohols,
ketones, volatile fatty acids, ester, and other aliphatics. Based
on the analysis, the main organic contaminants are short-chain
alcohols and long-chain alcohols; it also contains some fatty
acids,suchaspropenoicacid,butanoicacid,andacetoaceticacid,
in addition to the esters, aliphatics, and ketones such as methyl
ketone and pentanone. However, the type of organic pollutants
is varied for the raw GTL process water and the pretreated GTL
process water since the pretreated wastewater contains alcohols,
ketones,andsomealiphatics.
Isolation and Puriﬁcation of Bacterial
Strains From Enrichment Cultures
Luria–Bertani(LB)mediumwasusedfortheenrichmentculture,
isolation,andpuriﬁcationofthebacterialstrains(Figure1).
One milliliter of the GTL process water was suspended in
20ml liquid LB medium as the ﬁrst enrichment step. The liquid
cultures were incubated at 30◦C in a rotating shaker set at 200
rpm for 3 days. At the end of the incubation period, 2ml from
eachliquidculturewastransferredto20mlmineralsaltsmedium
(MSM)-GTL as the adaptation step. The adaptation steps were
repeated three times. Then, aliquots (100 µl) of the MSM-GTL
enrichment cultures were spread on solid LB agar medium. The
LB plates were incubated at 30◦C for 24h. Isolates exhibiting
distinct colonial morphologies were isolated and transferred to
separate LB agar plates for further puriﬁcation. Consequent
puriﬁcation of the bacterial isolates was repeated six times using

0.1g.Themediawerepreparedusingdiﬀerentconcentrationsof
GTL process water. All media were sterilized by autoclaving at
121◦C for 20min. Analysis was performed after the incubation
periods to investigate the reduction in organic pollutants
present in GTL wastewater. The bacterial growth was evaluatedusing the Lambda 25 UV/VIS spectrophotometer at 600nm.
Samples were collected and analyzed at several time intervals
to conﬁrm the growth and the biodegradation eﬃciency of
the isolated bacteria. All biodegradation experiments were
carried out at optimal conditions, temperature of 30◦C and
pH 7, since there was no growth or organic removal observed
at room temperature (T =25◦C) and pH values (pH 3.0
and5.0).
COD Determination
The COD analysis was carried out using a HAC-UV
spectrophotometer with COD reagents. The analysis was
obtained by adding 2ml of the water sample into the
HAC LCK514 cuvettes and heating for 2h to complete the
reaction between the reagent and water sample. The sample
was then transferred to the HAC 3900 to read the COD
content in milligrams per liter. Each sample was analyzed
induplicate.
Molecular Identiﬁcation of Isolates
The DNA was obtained from cells grown on LB solid
media overnight at 30◦C. Pure colonies were suspended into
Eppendorf tubes ﬁlled with 0.5ml of sterile distilled water.
The Eppendorf tubes were incubated in a water bath set at
100◦C for 10min and then placed in an ice bath for 1min.
After centrifugation for 60s at 12,300 rpm, the supernatant
containing total DNA was carefully transferred to a new sterile
Eppendorf tube. The ampliﬁcation of the 16S rRNA gene
fragmentsof ∼1.5kbwascarreidoutusingtwouniversalprimers:
RibS73sp 5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCA-3′and RibS74sp 5′-
AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3′(Lane, 1991). The PCR
rea
ctions were performed in a total volume of 25 µl including
MgCl21.5µM, dNTP 0.8 µM, forward primer 1.35 µM, reverse
primer 1.35 µM, and 0.5 IU Taq DNA polymerase; 2 µl of
genomic DNA from the isolates served as template for the
PCRreactions.

PCR products was acomplished using an Invitrogen PureLink
PCR Puriﬁcation Kit. The DNA sequencing was performed
using a Genetic Analyzer-Applied Biosystems 3,500 Series. The
obtained sequences of 16S rRNA gene fragments were then
compared with the most closely related species available in the
GenBankdatabaseusingtheNCBIBlastserver.Additionally,the

sequences in the GenBank database using the Blast server at
NCBI. T
he three isolates identiﬁed were as follows: Alcaligenes
faecalis(RZ3),Stenotrophomonas sp. (RZ4), and Ochrobactrum
sp.(RZ5)(Figure2).
It can be concluded that a few strains were isolated. There
are two possible reasons for this. The water samples contained
highly toxic organic compounds, so that only the three isolated
strains were able to tolerate this high level of water toxicity. The
enrichmentmediumcontainedlownutrientcontents,whichmay
not be enough to sustain the required nutrients for cell growth
and maintenance. Therefore, a few cells would have been able to
adaptandsubsist.Thisresultshowsthattheisolationstrategywas
eﬃcient to bacteria by enriching cultures in LB containing GTL
process water. This culture medium was very toxic to bacteria
because of the high organic concentration (COD ranging from
6,000 to 7,000 mg/L). The aim of the isolation procedure was to
isolate and purify bacteria with strong potentials to degrade and
tolerateGTLprocesswater.
The isolated bacteria have been widely applied in the
treatment of diﬀerent GTL process water containing a variety
of organic contaminants. Table2summarizes the application
of these strains in wastewater treatment in previous studies. A.
faecalisshows high performance in the removal of ammonia
from wastewaters ( Neerackal et al., 2016). However, it has high
tolerance in
phenol removal from wastewater, even at very high
initial concentrations (Bai et al., 2007). It was conﬁrmed by
Essam et al. (2010) that an isolated strain of A. f aecalishas
the ability to grow in phenol; however, it has diﬃculty to grow
and remove other phenol derivatives, such as nitrophenols and
chlorophenols. Additionally, the bacterium was shown with low
tolerancetogrowinalcoholiccompoundssuchasmethanoland
ethanol (Essam et al., 2010). Stenotrophomonas sp. is reported
with its tolerance in heavy metal removal (Gunasundari and
Muthukumar,
2013); however, it showed good performance in
the remov
al of phenols and organic carbon present in reﬁnery
wastewaters(PatelandPatel,2020). Ochrobactrum sp.is aGram-
negative, rod-shaped, aerobic and oxidase-positive bacterium
(Arulazhagan and Vasudevan, 2011). This bacterium showed
high
treatment performance of several contaminants present in
wastewaters (Qiu et al., 2007). Neoh et al. (2016) showed that
Ochrob
actrumsp. has high performance in the biotreatment of
agricultural wastewaters that contain high COD and nitrogen
contents. In addition, Ochrobactrum sp. has high performance
in the removal of phenol and its derivatives ( El-Sayed et al.,
2003; Qiu
et al., 2007). The removal of the organic compounds
present
intheGTLprocesswaterwasnotdocumentedusingthe
isolatedstrains.
Biodegradation of Organic Pollutants From
GTL Process Water
Organic Removal Using Several Strains
The potential of the isolated bacterial strains in the removal of
organic compounds present in the Qatari GTL process water
using pure and mixed cultures was evaluated. The GTL process
water used in this section was obtained after the pretreatmentprocess and has COD content of 1,800 mg/L. A set of 14
experiments were performed using the MSM-GTL medium to
screen the isolated strains for the biodegradation of organic
pollutants in GTL wastewater. All samples were kept in the
incubator in which the COD content and biomass growth
(biomass production) were evaluated at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days.
The growth curves of single and mixed cultures are shown in
Figure2. It is clear that the three strains reach their maximum
growth after 3 to 4 incubation days. Interestingly, the growth
started immediately after inoculation, without a clear lag phase.
This means that all the strains are highly adapted to the
substrates, which are the organic compounds in GTL process
waterincludingalcohol,ketones,esters,andaliphatics.However,
a clear decline in growth was observed after this period. The
period of high growth was marked with a fast decrease of the
COD content, which continued up to the 7th day (Figure3).
Nevertheless,therewasnofurtherCODreductionobservedafter

a 1-week incubation. When comparing the growth curves and
corresponding
COD reduction curves for each single or mixed
culture, it can be noticed that the strain Stenotrophomonas sp.
(RZ4)showedthehighestgrowthrateasasingleculture,followed
by the mixture Stenotrophomonas sp. with Ochrobactrum sp.
(RZ5). Although Ochrobactrum sp. growth was the least as a
single culture, a clear symbiotic and cooperation can improve
the growth of Ochrobactrum sp. by the concomitant growth of
Stenotrophomonas sp. A pure culture of Ochrobactrum sp. can
alsoachievearound56%CODreductionsimilartothatobtained
byStenotrophomonas sp. alone or by Stenotrophomonas sp. and
Ochrobactrum sp.after14incubationdays.However,theyieldof
Ochrobactrum sp. in biomass production was lower than that of
Stenotrophomonas sp.
The strain A. faecalis (RZ3) also showed less growth rate
than that of Stenotrophomonas sp. alone, which is reﬂected in
FIGURE 4 | Biological tr eatment of GTL process water using Alcaligenes
faecalis(RZ3).(A)Biomass growth; (B)COD reduction.a slightly lower COD reduction (52%). Mixing A. f aecaliswith
Stenotrophomonas sp. did not improve its growth, although the
COD reduction was improved to the best level. In contrast, the
combination of the three strains resulted in biomass growth and
COD reduction similar to that of Stenotrophomonas sp. alone.
It seems that the strain Stenotrophomonas sp. can be used alone
to remediate the Qatari GTL process water at these conditions
(COD1,800mg/L).
Effect of COD Concentration on
Biodegradation Performance
The performance of the isolated strains to grow and remove
organics in GTL process water at three initial COD contents
(1,800,3,800,and5,500mg/L)wasinvestigated.TheinitialCOD
content of the raw GTL process water was 5,500 mg/L, which
was pretreated to reduce its concentration to 1,800 mg/L. The
third COD content (3,800 mg/L) was obtained by diluting the
initial raw GTL process water. The biodegradation performance
of pure and mixed culture of the three strains was evaluated at
FIGURE 5 | Biological tr eatment of GTL process water using

131Surkatti et al. Isolation of Bacteria From GTL Process Water
each COD content. The biomass growth and COD reduction
for e
ach water sample (with diﬀerent COD concentrations)
are shown in Figures4–7. Interestingly, the results of Figure4
show that the strain A. faecalis (RZ3) is not inhibited by the
excess of organic pollutants (high COD process water) since an
increaseofthegrowthrateisrelatedtoCODincrease.Moreover,
the overall removal of COD after 14 days of incubation was
almost similar (60%). This may be attributed to the ability
ofA. faecalis to remove several organic pollutants in GTL
wastewaterincludingfattyacidsthatareavailableintherawGTL
processwater.
The growth of both strains Stenotrophomonas sp. (RZ4) and
Ochrobactrum sp. (RZ5) was negatively aﬀected by the increase
of the COD content in the growth medium. This means that
these strains may be inhibited by the excess of substrates or
inhibited by several organics present in GTL process water. The
combination of the three strains showed high ability in the
degradation of organic pollutants present in GTL process water,
FIGURE 6 | Biological tr eatment of GTL process water using Ochrobactrum
sp. (RZ5). (A)Biomass growth; (B)COD reduction.which indicates the synergy eﬀect for several strains in the GTL
wastewater
treatment.
Although the three isolates were capable of degrading the
organic pollutants in GTL process water at various COD
contents, the removal of these organic contaminants by mixed
cultures was improved compared with individual strains as
shown in Figure7. Each individual microorganism may have
the ability to metabolize limited types of substrates; thus, the
combination of diﬀerent bacterial strains with wider enzymatic
capabilities will result in the degradation of more organic
pollutants giving higher COD reduction. This was conﬁrmed by
Senthilvelan et al. (2014) when they tested phenol degradation
usingsingle
strainsandmixedculture.Intheirstudy,asigniﬁcant
increase in the biodegradation rate and phenol removal was
obtainedusingmixedmicrobialculture.
Since short-chain alcohols (SCA) represent about 82% of the
COD content of GTL process water ( Majone et al., 2010), GC
analysis wa
s carried out to determine their concentrations in

FIGURE 8 | GC analysis for short-chain alcohols (C1–C6) in GTL process water: (A)before and (B)after biotreatment.
GTL process water before and after biotreatment. GTL process
water and
biotreated water contain SCA (C1–C6) concentration
of2,465and813mg/L,respectively(Figures8A,B).Theanalysis
showed that the isolated bacteria were able to degrade around
60%oftheshort-chainalcohols.
Since the SCA are the major contributor to the COD
content in GTL process water, it is important to reduce their
concentration through biotreatment, in order for the treated
watertobereusedordischargedsafely.
It is obvious that GTL process water has a broader range of
organic pollutants. This may require the application of several
types of microorganisms in order to achieve high degradation
performance. Thus, it is recommended to use mixed bacterial
strains for the biological treatment of GTL process water, at
diﬀerent ranges of COD contents. The main novelty of this
study is the application of the isolated strains to remove the
organic pollutants in the same GTL process water and achievehighCODreductionunderstressconditions,whichhasnotbeen
reportedbefore.
CONCLUSIONS
It is evident from this study that GTL process water is a
rich source of organic components that are rather diﬃcult
to remove or degrade. However, the isolation, identiﬁcation,
and testing of organics-degrading bacterial strains, such as A.
faecalis,Stenotrophomonas sp.,andOchrobactrum sp.,fromGTL
water showed that these strains have the capability to degrade
the organic contaminants in GTL water and can be a good
alternative for the conventional activated sludge systems, which
are currently applied in the biological treatment of GTL process
water. Each bacterial strain has the ability to work as a single
strain or in a mixed culture to remove the organic pollutants

Global environmental contamination with a complex mixture of xenobiotics has
become a major environmental issue worldwide. Many xenobiotic compounds severely
impact the environment due to their high toxicity, prolonged persistence, and limited
biodegradability.Microbial-assisteddegradationofxenobioticcompoundsisconsidered
to be the most effective and beneﬁcial approach. Microorganisms have remarkable
catabolic potential, with genes, enzymes, and degradation pathways implicated
in the process of biodegradation. A number of microbes, including Alcaligenes,
Cellulosimicrobium, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Methanospirillum, Aeromonas,
Sphingobium, Flavobacterium, Rhodococcus, Aspergillus, Penecillium, Trichoderma,
Streptomyces, Rhodotorula, Candida, and Aureobasidium, have been isolated and
characterized, and have shown exceptional biodegradation potential for a variety
of xenobiotic contaminants from soil/water environments. Microorganisms potentially
utilize xenobiotic contaminants as carbon or nitrogen sources to sustain their growth
and metabolic activities. Diverse microbial populations survive in harsh contaminated
environments,exhibitingasigniﬁcantbiodegradationpotentialtodegradeandtransform
pollutants. However, the study of such microbial populations requires a more advanced
and multifaceted approach. Currently, multiple advanced approaches, including

INTRODUCTION
The environment is everything that naturally surrounds us and
aﬀects our daily lives on Earth. A safe and healthy environment
is essential for the existence of life on this planet. However,
in the era of advanced industrialization and urbanization,
various anthropogenic activities are largely responsible for
the introduction of toxic and hazardous pollutants such as
environmental xenobiotics ( Embrandiri et al., 2016; Malla et al.,
2018; B
hatt et al., 2020a; Rodriguez et al., 2020). Xenobiotics
are c
hemical substances not naturally produced or expected
to be present within organisms. The term “xenobiotic” is
usually used in the context of environmental pollutants to
refer to synthetic compounds produced in large volumes
for industrial, agricultural, and domestic use ( Embrandiri
et al.,
2016; Atashgahi et al., 2018; Dinka, 2018). There is
growing public
concern over the wide range of xenobiotic
compounds being introduced, deliberately or accidentally,
into the environment, which involves high potential risk
to humans and animals ( Jacob and Cherian, 2013; Hashmi
et al.,
2017; Zhu et al., 2017; Dinka, 2018). Environmental
xenobiotics
includepesticides,polycyclicaromatichydrocarbons
(PAHs), pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs), personal-
care products (PCPs), phenolics, chlorinated compounds, and
other industrial chemicals. Their increasing frequency in
diﬀerentenvironmentalcompartmentshasraisedconcernsabout
their potential adverse eﬀects ( Crinnion, 2010; Kim et al.,
2013; Embrandiri
et al., 2016; Tsaboula et al., 2016; Dhakal
et al., 2017). Their toxicity results in unprecedented health
hazards
andriskstoenvironmentalsafetyandsecurity(Godheja
et al.,
2016; Dovrak et al., 2017; Burgos-Aceves et al., 2018;
RavindraandHaq,2019 ).Oncexenobioticsarereleasedintothe
environment,
they can bioaccumulate within the food chain due
to their high aﬃnity toward organic substances, and produce
toxic adverse eﬀects toward natural ecosystems, humans, and
animals (Pedersen et al., 2003; Iovdijova and Bencko, 2010;
Maurya, 2016
). Consequently, they can cause severe chronic
eﬀects
suchasrespiratorytractinfections,damagetotheimmune
system, pulmonary bronchitis, dysfunction of the nervous
system, disruption of the endocrine system, behavioral and
developmentaldisorders,andcarcinogenicandmutageniceﬀects
(Sajid et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017; Dinka, 2018; Catron et al.,
2019; Mis
hra et al., 2019; Bertotto et al., 2020). Thus, xenobiotic
contamination
represents a persistent anthropogenic threat and
raises serious environmental concerns. Various physical and
chemical treatment methods such as coagulation, ﬁltration,
adsorption, chemical precipitation, electrolysis ozonation, etc.
have been used for the degradation and detoxiﬁcation ofsuch xenobiotic compounds, but not all these methods are
very useful due to their high cost, waste-disposal problem
and generation of toxic by-products that are sometimes
more hazardous than the parent compound. In contrast, the
biological remediation method, “bioremediation,” is a widely
accepted clean-up strategy for the degradation of xenobiotics
from contaminated environments without producing harmful
products(Pauletal.,2005;Perelo,2010).Bioremediationinvolves
the met
abolic capabilities of microorganisms in the removal
of pollutants and thus, is the most suitable and promising
technologythesedays(GilliespieandPhilp,2013;Azubuikeetal.,
2016).
Microbial remediation
of xenobiotic compounds is regarded
as a superﬁcial, proﬁcient, economically feasible approach that
uses a wide range of microorganisms to consume organic
pollutants as carbon or nitrogen supplements to sustain their
developmental activities (Chen et al., 2013; Mahmoud, 2016;
Arora et
al., 2018; Ortiz-Hernandez et al., 2018; Siles and
Margesin, 2018; Zhan et al., 2018; Bhatt et al., 2020b).
Microorg
anisms are ubiquitous in nature, and diverse microbial
communities thrive in natural and extreme stress environments,
including soil, water, the human gut, hydrothermal vents, acid
mine runoﬀ, and oil reservoirs ( Cyco´n and Piotrowska-Seget,
2016;J
alowieckietal.,2016;Dingetal.,2017;Aguingaetal.,2018;
Wang Y. F. et al., 2018; Zierer et al., 2018; Delegan et al., 2019;
Arora, 2020; Shekhar et al., 2020). Microbial populations exhibit
potential for
the remediation of any contaminated environment
because of their genetic diversity and functionality (Chen et al.,
2015; B
astida et al., 2016; Bhatt and Barh, 2018; Dangi et al.,
2018). Therefore, the study of microbial population existing in
contaminated
environments provides a signiﬁcant knowledge of
speciﬁcmicrobialcharacteristicsthatimprovedegradationrates.
However, eﬀective implementation of microbial remediation
strategies needs advanced technical approaches, which provide
an in-depth understanding about the dynamics aspects of
microbial activity and survival under stressed environment
(Rastogi and Sani, 2011; Lima-Morales et al., 2016; Mao
et al.,
2019). The development in molecular, biotechnological,
bioinformatics
and system biology tools pertaining to bio-
remedial problems have provided gene level mechanisms of
bioremediation (Ahmad and Ahmad, 2014; Aora and Bar,
2014; Sing
h D. P. et al., 2018; Jaiswal and Shukla, 2020;
Nkongolo and Kotha, 2020; Wolf et al., 2020). Moreover, the
direct
study of microorganisms in a contaminated environment
including the whole microbial population granted a new
frontier of the scientiﬁc community to share the knowledge
of the uncultured microbial world ( Zepeda et al., 2015; Zhao
Q.et
al., 2017; Panigrahi et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2020).
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin. org 2 February 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 632059
137Mishra et al. Recent Advanced Technologies for Bioremediation
The development of advance molecular tools and a better
underst
anding of microbial metabolic and genetic structures
and functions have accelerated encroachment in recombinant
engineering techniques to enhanced bioremediation for removal
of environmental pollutants ( Ram et al., 2005; Temperton
and Giov
annoni, 2012; Singh V. et al., 2018; Stein et al.,
2018; Delegan et al., 2019; Marco and Abram, 2019; Puckett
et al., 2020). Soil is the most dynamic environment for the
enormous microbial
population of immense diversity. It has
been estimated that one gram of soil approximately contains
109bacterial cells, but only <1% of these may be culturable in
thelaboratory(Rossello-MoraandAmann,2001).Culturebased
identiﬁcation
of diverse microbial population in a contaminated
environment, is a challenging task, which is limited to fast-
growingmicrobialdiversity(Gillbrideetal.,2006).Thus,modern
culture-independent mole
cular techniques represent a feasible
approachtounrevealingthediversityandfunctionaldynamicsof
microbial population in contaminated environments. Moreover,
the advanced innovation in molecular tools and techniques
providesnewinsightsandchangesthetraditionalresearchtrend
intheﬁeldofbioremediation( Maliketal.,2008;Shahetal.,2011;
Dev
arapalli and Kumavnath, 2015; Mahmoud, 2016; Biswas and
Sarkar, 2018; Shakya et al., 2019). Omics technologies are the
result
of advanced molecular techniques, which involved direct
characterization of genome structure of microorganisms, devoid
of their culture sample (Segata et al., 2013; Biswas and Sarkar,
2018; J
aiswal et al., 2019; Yu K. et al., 2019). Therefore, the
applications
of modern molecular techniques like metagenomic,
transcriptomic, proteomic generates relevant information on
genes and proteins expression levels in whole microbial
communities under contaminated environments attempted to
unravel the mechanism of microbial degradation and successful
execution of bioremediation ( Keller and Hettich, 2009; Yang,
2013;M
allaetal.,2018;Bharagavaetal.,2019;MarcoandAbram,
2019; Rodriguez et al., 2020). These methods are comparatively
eﬃcient,
quicker, and accurate, which overcome the limitations
of conventional molecular techniques. It explores the advanced
microbialdegradationmechanismofxenobiotics,theirmetabolic
activities, genetic regulation and molecular-biology aspects
(Cyco´n et al., 2017; Gutierrez et al., 2018; Gutleben et al.,
2018; Mis
hra et al., 2020 ). Hence, this review article highlights
the biode
gradation potential of microorganisms and provides
insights into recent advance methods of “omics” technologies
employed in microbial degradation and remediation purpose of
xenobioticsandtheirperspectivesinmodernbiologicalresearch.
BIOREMEDIATION POTENTIAL OF
MICROORGANISMS FOR XENOBIOTIC
COMPOUNDS
The application of microorganisms in removing xenobiotics
from soil, water or sediments through complete transformation
or mineralization into harmless end products like CO 2and
H2O is a basic concept of bioremediation strategy (Ortiz et al.,
2013;Sing
h et al., 2016 ). Diﬀerent microorganisms including
bacteria
(Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, Cellulosimicrobium,
Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Methanospirillum, Aeromonas,Bacillus, Sphingobium, Flavobacterium, andRhodococcus),
fungi (Aspergillus, Penecillium, Trichoderma, and Fusarium),
and yeasts (Pichia, Rhodotorula, Candida, Aureobasidium, and
Exophiala) have been reported to be involved in the eﬃcient
biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds from contaminated
soil/waterenvironments,duetotheirexceptionalbioremediation
potential ( Sathishkumar et al., 2008; Nzila, 2013; Sunita et al.,
2013;Zh
ao Q. et al., 2017; Bharadwaj, 2018; Yang J. et al., 2018;
Yang T. et al., 2018; Yu Y. et al., 2019; Bhatt et al., 2020c).
The biode
gradation ability of microbes is greatly inﬂuenced by
interactiveecologicalfactorsincludingsoil,salinity,temperature,
carbon source, moisture content, pH, nitrogen sources,
inoculums concentration, etc. (Megharaj and Naidu, 2010;
Wu et
al., 2014; Bhatt et al., 2019). Microorganisms harbor
remarkable
catabolic potential, genes, enzymes, and degradation
pathways implicated in the process of bioremediation, which
might be responsible in the evolution of novel traits and
characters ( Widada et al., 2002; Scholer et al., 2017; Yan et al.,
2018; Zhu
et al., 2020). Moreover, microbial plasmids believed
to be
responsible for the continuous progression, evolution,
and distribution of novel biodegradable genes/enzymes (Zhang
et al.,
2016; Jeﬀries et al., 2019). These novel genes/enzymes
have
endowed microorganism’s biodegradation capability to
remove or detoxify a wide variety of environmental pollutants
due to their inheritance horizontal gene transfer property
(Singh V. et al., 2018; Jaiswal et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Phale
et al.,
2019; French et al., 2020). The microbial remediation
proces
s can be further improved via successful application
of genome editing and biochemical techniques that modify
existing strains and result in the development of a genetically
modiﬁed organism capable of simultaneously degrading several
xenobiotics ( Shanker et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2016; Hussain
et al.,
2018; Janssen and Stucki, 2020). The advancement of
genetic manipulation
technology gives more clear information
and explores future prospects of bioremediation of xenobiotics
through highly proﬁcient microorganisms (Sayler and Ripp,
2000; S
hapiro et al., 2018; Wong, 2018; Liu et al., 2019). The
chemical
structures of several xenobiotic compounds are
presentedin Figure1.
Synthetic pesticides are the major example of xenobiotics
especially the organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) that used
extensively worldwide for a long period of time in agriculture as
well as in insect control program. Several OCPs such as aldrin,
dieldrin, dichloro diphenyl trichloro ethane (DDT), benzene
hexachloride(BHC),andhexachlorocyclohexanearehighlytoxic
in nature due to their stability and bioaccumulative property
(Aktar et al., 2009; Jayaraj et al., 2016; Awasthi and Awasthi,
2019; P
ang et al., 2020). Lindane (γ -hexa chlorocyclohexane) is
one of the highly toxic organochlorine xenobiotic compound,
which is well-studied for its microbial biodegradation through
physical (soil structure, carbon and oxygen gradients, pH, and
temperature) and chemical (dechlorination, dehydroxylation,
anddehydrogenation)interactions(KaurandKaur,2016;Bashir
et al.,
2018; Zhang et al., 2021 ). The increasing concentration
of lind
ane residues into the environment imposes severe
health hazards such as carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, endocrine
disruption, and immune-suppression diseases into the humans
and other organisms ( Cuozzo et al., 2017; Zhang et al.,
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org 3 February 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 632059

2020). Bacterial strains genera such as Bacillus , Burkholderia,
Pseudomonas, Kocuria, Archromobacter, Sphingomonas,
Chromohalobacter, demonstrated lindane biodegradation
under axenic as well as anoxic conditions via dehydrogenation,
dehydrochlorination, and hydroxylation, results in complete
degradation or mineralization (Giri et al., 2014; Cuozzo et al.,
2017; Wang
W. et al., 2018; Nagata et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,
2020). A simpliﬁed catabolic pathway of lindane is presented in
Figure2
.
Pyrethroidsarebroadspectrumpesticidemainlyusedagainst
agricultural and household pests. Cypermethrin, cyhalothrin,
deltamethrin, cyﬂuthrin, bifenthrin are the common example
of synthetic pyrethroids ( Chen et al., 2012, 2014; Bhatt et al.,
2019;Zh
an et al., 2020 ). These pesticides are highly toxic andpersistent
and can cause molecular toxicity, neurotoxicity, and
reproductive toxicity (Sharma et al., 2018; Bhatt et al., 2019;
Gammon et
al., 2019). One of the pyrethroid i.e., cypermethrin
can cros
s the blood-brain barrier and induces neurotoxicity
and motor deﬁcits (Singh et al., 2012). The persistence of
these
pesticides in the environment poses a severe threat to
humans and other non-target terrestrial and aquatic organisms
(Burns and Pastoor, 2018; Ullah et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019).
Microbial strains
such asAcinetobacter, Trichoderma, Roultella,
Pseudomonas, Cunninghamella, and Bacillushave been reported
for their eﬃcient degradation of broad spectrum pesticides
like cypermethrin and other pyrethroid pesticides through
pyrethroid hydrolases ( Cyco´n and Piotrowska-Seget, 2016;
Zhan
et al., 2018; Bhatt et al., 2019; Chen and Zhan, 2019 ).

Polychlorinated
bis-phenyles (PCBs) are classiﬁed as
persistent organic pollutants with high toxicity (Lallas, 2001;
Pathira

in humans
including immune system damage, decreasedpulmonaryfunction,bronchitis,andinterferencewithhormones

polychlorinated
bis-phenyles (PCBs) is a promising remediation
technology involving two major pathways: aerobic degradation
and anaerobic dehalogination (Abraham et al., 2002; Pathiraja

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are potent

benzo(a)pyrene,
phenanthrene,andnaphthalenearewell-known
to produce harmful biological eﬀects such as genotoxicity,
mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity and therefore pose a serious
threat to the human health (Kim et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2020).
Microorg
anisms belonging to Sphingomonas, Sphingobium,
andNovosphingobium have been found as eﬃcient degrader
of PAHs (Lee et al., 2016b; Fida et al., 2017; Auti et al., 2019).
Rhodococcus, Cunning

Agmenellum quadriplicatum, Brevibacterium, and Nocardiodes
have been widely shown to metabolize particularly naphthalene
andphenanthrene( Ghosaletal.,2016;SilesandMargesin,2018).
Ortega-Gonzalez et al. (2015) demonstrated that Amycolaptos is
sp. Poz14 degraded 100% of naphthalene and 37.87% of
anthracene within 45 days. A PAH-degrading marine bacterium

Phthalates or esters of phthalic acids are synthetic xenobiotic
chemicals, which are extensively used as plasticizers added
to polyvinyl chloride to improve its ﬂexibility and hardness
(Crinnion, 2010; Singh and Li, 2011; Przybylinska and
Wyszkowski,
2016). Phthalates are readily released into the
environment and
create a risk of exposure for humans and
other living organisms due their endocrine disrupting behavior
(Przybylinska and Wyszkowski, 2016). They cause infertility,

RECENT ADV
ANCED TECHNOLOGIES
EMPLOYED IN BIOREMEDIATION FOR
IDENTIFICATION AND
CHARACTERIZATION OF
MICROORGANISMS AND MICROBIAL
COMMUNITIES
There are several revolutionary advanced molecular practices,
includinggenomics,metagenomics,proteomics,transcriptomics,
and metabolomics, which deliver deeper insights into microbial
activitieswithrespecttotheirgenes,proteins,mRNAexpression
levels, enzymes and metabolic pathways with changing
environments (Figure1). The integrated approach of these
multiple technologies in the ﬁeld of bioremediation is termed as
the “omics approach,” used for the undeviating characterization
of biological macromolecules, and their speciﬁc genetic
and molecular structures and function mechanisms in a
set of microorganisms/microbial communities ( Desai et al.,
2009; Y
ang, 2013; Godheja et al., 2014; Franzosa et al., 2015;
Chandran et al., 2020). The application of omics technologies
provides
comprehensive insights into microbial populations,
their mechanisms of interaction with pollutants, metabolic
activities, and genetic-regulation and molecular-biology aspects
(Akinsanya et al., 2015; Kaul et al., 2016; Misra et al., 2018;
Marco
and Abram, 2019; Huang et al., 2021). Moreover, these
approac
hes can broaden our knowledge of the so-called “viable
but non-culturable (VBNC)” bacteria and their potentially
novel pathways for degrading environmental pollutants (Oliver,
2010; Bodor
et al., 2020). It is believed that these uncultured
bacteria
may play an important role in the biodegradation
of environmental pollutant. However, little is known about
the VBNC bacteria as these bacteria cannot be cultivated on
conventional media and are very diﬀerent from cells (Su et al.,
2013).
VBNC cells exhibit metabolic and respiratory activities
and may
perform transcription and gene expression, which
allows them to recover culturability (Oliver et al., 2005; Zhao
X. et
al., 2017). The VBNC bacteria could be resuscitated in
favora
ble conditions by an autoinducer (AI-2) (Bari et al., 2013)
or re
suscitated promoting factor (Rpf) (Li et al., 2015). The
VBNC
bacterial cells are detected on the basis of their viability.
Several culture-independent molecular-based methods such
as denaturing and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE/TGGE), ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (FISH),
terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP),
fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), and next-generation sequencing
(NGS) technology are used for obtaining important information
about the structural composition and genetic diversity of
unculturable microorganisms (Zhao X. et al., 2017; Bodor et al.,
2020). Sele
ctive gene ampliﬁcation is an emerging approach to
detect
viable cells. Zhong et al. (2016) developed a real-time

monoazide), a high-aﬃnity photolysis DNA nucleic acid dye

Genomics and
Metagenomics
Genomics and metagenomics are powerful tools for analyzing
microbial communities at the genomic level from various
contaminated environments. This technology gives a new
array to environmental microbiologists for understanding
unculturable microbiota with a genetic variability of microbial
communities (Devarapalli and Kumavnath, 2015; Zhu et al.,
2018; Awa
sthi et al., 2020 ). It gives more details about the
particular de
gradation potential of microbial communities, as it
directlyentailsthewhole-genomesequencefromenvironmental
samples (Table1). Metagenomic studies unblock traditional
ways of uncultured microorganisms and explore their genetic
advantage in the process of bioremediation (Rahimi et al.,
2018;N
ascimentoetal.,2020).Completegenome-sequencedata

important microbial strains, including Pseudomonas
aeruginosa KT2440, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1,Deinococcus

been given, which is pertinent to successful bioremediation
(http://www.tigr.org).Thenewgenescantelltoomuchaboutthe

Current metagenomic practices allowed for identifying the
whole-genome structure of microorganisms and specifying
particular genes that are attributed to encode degradative
enzymesforthemineralizationofxenobiotics( Zafraetal.,2016;
Zhu et
al., 2020). Thus, metagenomics clearly highlights the
crucial role
of novel genes in connecting the entire microbial
population with functional diversity and structural identity.
Metagenomics involves the manufacturing of metagenomic
libraries that include (I) production of the proper size of DNA
fragments,andligationofthesefragmentsintoasuitablecloning
vector; (II) further recombinant vectors introduced into an
appropriate bacterium cloning host; (III) clones that harbor
speciﬁc characters, functions, or sequences were screened for
libraries (Figure3). Moreover, the screening of metagenomic
librariescanbeperformedbytwoprocesses,i.e.,sequence-driven
analysis using high-throughput sequencing, and functional
analysis using phenotypic expressions ( Handelsman, 2004).
However
, recent sequence-based metagenome analyses (such as
SOLiDsystemofAppliedBiosystems,Roche454sequencing)are
performed without the construction of cloned libraries (Kumar
etal.,
2020).
Function-driven met
agenomics is a potent method for
studying the functional aspect of genes. It is widely used for
discovering novel genes with desired functions or exploring
the sequence diversity of protein families (Taupp et al., 2011;
Lam et
al., 2015). A function-driven analysis involves the
construction and
screening of metagenomic libraries to identify
novel enzymes ( Chakraborthy and Das, 2016; Kumar et al.,2020).U
sing functional metagenomics, many novel antibiotic-
resist
ant genes were identiﬁed from environmental sources
(Ngara and Zhang, 2018). The majority of metagenome-
derived hydrolytic
enzymes, mainly esterases and glycoside
hydrolases, have been characterized biochemically and mainly
originated from functional metagenomics ( Steele et al., 2009;
Taupp et
al., 2011). A novel functional screening method,
a meta
genome extract thin layer chromatography (META)
system, was developed by Rabausch et al. (2013) for the
rapid dete
ction of glycosyltransferase (GT) and other ﬂavonoid-
modifyingenzymesfrommetagenomicclonelibraries.Itinvolves
the screening of 38,000 clones from two diﬀerent metagenomic
libraries and allowed for the identiﬁcation of two novel
UDP glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes. Bouhajja et al. (2017)
utilized function-based screening of metagenomic libraries to
e
xplore the diversity of genes and microorganisms involved
in the monooxygenase-mediated toluene degradation in a
hydrocarbon-pollutedsedimentsample.
Metagenomic approaches oﬀer broad and reliable microbial
identiﬁcation on the species and strain levels, but they are
much costlier methods, and the most challenging part is
data investigation, which requires all short DNA sequences
to pair together to assemble the ﬁnal genome structure
(Bragg and Tyson, 2014). The involvement of indigenous soil
microorg
anisms in the degradation of PAHs was undertaken
byZafra et al. (2016) through a metagenomic approach.
This study
demonstrated the biodegradation eﬃciency of
microbial consortia with their degradative enzymes and
metabolites generated during the remediation process.
The microbial-community dynamics of reﬁned- and crude-
petroleum-contaminated soil by next-generation sequencing
(NGS), and their capability to degrade hydrocarbons and
plant-growth-promotion potential through in-silico analysis
was investigated by Auti et al. (2019). In this study, 16S rRNA
amplicon sequencing
on the Illumina MiSeq platform and
PICRUSt revealed that both types of soil contained microbial
communities with excellent metabolic potential for petroleum
hydrocarbon (PHC) degradation. Using KEGG orthology,
the abundance of functional genes involved in hydrocarbon
degradation showed the presence of 61 enzyme-encoding genes,
such as alkane monooxygenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and
aldehyde dehydrogenase ( Auti et al., 2019). 16S rDNA or 16S
rRNA
gene sequencing has led to evolutionary insights into the
phylogenetic and taxonomic identiﬁcation of microorganisms.
The 16S rRNA gene consists of several highly conserved regions
interleaved with variable regions in all microorganisms and thus

whereas phylogenetic analyses can be used to elucidate the

The NGS

of temporal and spatial data (Hidalgo et al., 2020). There

h-throughput sequencing techniques of ribosomal genes
that quantify community structures and functions at a higher
resolution, e.g., 16S rRNA in prokaryotes, and 5S or 18S
rRNA genes, or the internal-transcribe-spacer (ITS) region in
eukaryotes ( Luo et al., 2012). The eﬀectiveness of such NGS
tec

environments was elucidated, validated, and documented in
many studies (Brown et al., 2013; Shokralla et al., 2014; Zhou
et al.,

Transcriptomics
Transcriptomic
s is a remarkable tool that addresses the
division of genes transcribed in any organism known as the
transcriptome. It provides functional insight links involving the
genome, proteome, and cellular phenotype by studying their
mRNAtranscriptionalproﬁles,directlyextractedfromindividual
microbes or microbial communities ( Singh and Nagaraj, 2006;
McGrath
etal.,2008;Bashiardesetal.,2016).Signiﬁcantchanges
were seen
in gene-expression level and their regulation in
microbial communities under stressful environments for their
survival.Thus,transcriptomicsandmetatranscriptomicsprovide

genes, either of the individual cell or the entire microbial
community at a speciﬁc time (Table2; Li et al., 2014; He et al.,
2015; S
hakya et al., 2019). RNA seq and DNA microarrays
are signiﬁc
antly powerful technologies to determine the mRNA
expression level of every gene (Diaz, 2004). GeoChip uses key
enzymes
orgenestospotvariousmicrobe-mediatedmechanisms
for biogeochemical cycles, resistance mechanism for heavy
metals, and degradation pathways of xenobiotics (He et al.,
2010; Xiong
et al., 2010; Xie et al., 2011). Similarly, DNA-
and RN
A-SIP (Stable Isotope Probing) technologies are also
valuable to uncover the microbial taxa and catabolic genes that
are important for the bioremediation of polluted environments
(Lueders,2015).
DualRN
A-seq transcriptional proﬁle is a better approach
to understand the basic nature and mechanism of diﬀerentlyexpressed genes in the host and symbiotic microbes at a
time (Kaul et al., 2016). RNA seq allows for the detection of
morediﬀerently
expressed genes than a microarray alone does.
Thus, recent advancements and developments in microarrays,
RNA seq technology, transcriptomics, and metatranscriptomics
revealedunexpectedmicrobialdiversityinaquaticandterrestrial
environments with their synergistic relationships with humans,
animals, plants, and other microorganisms (Perez-Losada et al.,
2015; White
et al., 2016; Moniruzzaman et al., 2017; Berg et al.,
2018;Crumpetal.,2018).
RNA seq
technology is considered more eﬃcient than
traditional microarray platforms in gene expression proﬁling as
itprovidesawiderquantitativerangeofexpressionlevelchanges
compared to microarrays (Roh et al., 2010; Shakya et al., 2019).
The microarray
technique requires a lot of eﬀort and money
to prepare custom-made microarrays. Furthermore, the target
genes to be analyzed are limited in number and cannot cover
the whole set of genes in the community. In contrast, a number
of kits are now commercially available to carry out RNA-seq
analysis, whereby a whole set of genes in the community can
be quantitatively analyzed. Therefore, many studies are now
performedbyRNA-seqtechnology.
Lima-Morales et al. (2016) investigated the microbial
org
anization and catabolic gene diversity of three types of
contaminated soil under continuous long-term pollutant stress
with benzene and benzene/toluene/ethylene/xylene (BTEX) to
identify shifts in community structure and the prevalence
of key genes for catabolic pathways. Moreover, de novo
transcriptome synthesis gives new insights into and reveals
basic information about non-model species without a genome
reference.Hydrocarbon-degradingbacterium Achromobacter sp.
was isolated from seawater, and indicated that the upregulation
of enzymes such as dehydrogenases and monooxygenases, and
novel genes associated with fatty acid metabolism is responsible
for its enormous capability for hydrocarbon degradation and
survival( Hongetal.,2016).

et al. (2019) identiﬁed fungal species and subspecies in a mixed

strain-level discrepancy between the Cryptococcus fungal species
and their in-situmock communities. Thus, transcriptomic
analysis provides a large amount of gene information about the
potential function of microbial communities in adaptation and
survival in extreme environments ( Singh D. P. et al., 2018; Mao
etal.,
2019;Marcelinoetal.,2019).
Proteomics
Proteins are
crucial eﬀectors of biological responses, stabler
than RNAs in living organisms, and possibly confer an
integral view of biological function expressed in situ; the
term proteomics is put forward to study the entire set of
proteins expressed in an organism ( Ram et al., 2005; Singh,
2006; Hettic
h et al., 2013). Thus, proteomics has emerged
as an
interesting and fruitful technology to study protein
expression (post-translational modiﬁcations, protein turnover,
proteolysis, and changes in the corresponding gene expression)
of the microbial world (Keller and Hettich, 2009; Aslam et al.,
2017).
Proteomics is a promising aspect of omic technologies
in t
he ﬁeld of microbiology, allowing for investigating the
complete protein proﬁle obtained in a straight line from a
compositemicrobialpopulationinacontaminatedenvironment
(Williams et al., 2013; Arsene-Ploetze et al., 2015; Wang et al.,
2016).
However, metaproteomics is used to decipher crucial
information re
garding the protein proﬁling of two diverse
ecological units (Arsene-Ploetze et al., 2015). Proteomics has
been used
to identify microbial communities/microorganisms
in various ecosystems including soil and sediment, activated
sludge, marine and groundwater sediment, acid mine bioﬁlms,
and wastewater plants, as illustrated in Table3(Williams
et al.,
2013; Colatriano et al., 2015; Grob et al., 2015; Bastida
et al., 2016; Jagadeesh et al., 2017). These studies revealed
secret
information related to protein synthesis, gene-expression
stability, mRNA turnover, and protein–protein interaction
networks in microbial communities in stress environments
(Aslametal.,2017).
The inclusion
of a proteomic approach helps to identify
related enzymes and their metabolic pathways in the
bioremediation of xenobiotics from various contaminated
sites(Kimetal.,2004;Liuetal.,2017;Weietal.,2017).Basically,
there are
four primary steps that involve proteomic analysis: (1)
preparation of a biological sample; (2) extraction and separation
of proteins by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(2D-GE); (3) protein gel images are examined by means of
image-analysis software such as ImageMaster 2D or PDQuest;
and (4) proteins are identiﬁed by using mass spectroscopy
(MS)/MALDI-TOF/MS or LC-MS (Yates et al., 2009; Chakka
etal.,
2015;Velmurganetal.,2017).
A combined protein
proﬁle of 20 PAH-induced proteins
was studied by proteomics in Mycobacterium vanbaalenii
PYR-1 grown in a PAH-supplemented culture medium (Kim
et al.,
2004). PAH exposure of ﬁve diﬀerent compounds,
i.e., pyrene
, pyerene-4,5-quinone, phenanthrene, anthracene,
and ﬂuoranthere causes variation in protein composition,
showing upregulation of multiple proteins for PAH treatmentcompared to an uninduced control sample. Several PAH-
inducedproteinswereidentiﬁedbyLC-MS,includingacatalase-
peroxidase, a putative monooxygenase, a dioxygenase, a small
subunit of naphthalene-inducible dioxygenase, and aldehyde
dehydrogenase. The metaproteomic approach was employed
byBastida et al. (2016) to illustrate changes in metabolic
activities
during compost-treated bioremediation with the help
of diﬀerential protein expressions in hydrocarbon-polluted
soil. Metaproteomic analysis indicated that Sphingomonadales
and uncultured bacteria are responsible for the degradation
of hydrocarbons in compost-treated soil due to the higher
expression of catabolic enzymes such as 2-hydroxymuconic
semialdehyde, cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and catechol 2,3-
dioxygenase, dioxygenases involved in the ﬁrst oxygenation step
of aromatic rings. Moreover, biphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase,
estradiol dioxygenase, and naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase were
identiﬁedincompost-treatedsamples.Byusingmetaproteomics,
this study explored the functional and phylogenetic relationship
of contaminated soil, and the microbial key players involved in
compost-assistedbioremediation.
Another study, undertaken by Vandera et al. (2015)
demonstrated the comparative proteomic analysis of
Art
hrobacter phenanivorans Sphe3 on aromatic compounds
phenanthrene and phthalates. The proteomic approach
conﬁrmed the involvement of several proteins in aromatic-
substrate degradation by identifying those mediating the initial
ring hydroxylation and ring cleavage of phenanthrene to
phthalate. This study also revealed the presence of both the
ortho-and themeta-cleavage pathway for the degradation of
thesearomaticcompounds,anditalsoidentiﬁedallproteinsthat
take part in these pathways and are highly upregulated upon
phthalategrowthincomparisontophenanthrenegrowth.
Proteomic analysis of pyrene-degrading bacterium
Achromobacter xylosoxidans PY4 was performed by Nzila et al.
(2018),
who identiﬁed a total of 1,094 proteins. Among these,
95 proteins
were detected in glucose supplementation, and 612
proteins were detected in the presence of pyrene. Furthermore,
25 upregulated proteins were found to be involved in stress
response and the progression of genetic information. Two
upregulated proteins, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase
and homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, are implicated in
the lower degradation pathway of pyrene. Enzyme 4-
hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase may catalyze the
conversion of 2-hydroxybenzalpyruvic acid (metabolite of
pyrene) to homogentisate. Homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase is
involved in the incorporation of 2 oxygen atoms to produce
4-maleyacetoacetate, which is an intermediate in several
metabolicpathways.
Lee et al. (2016b)performed proteomic analysis of PAH-
degrading
bacterial isolate Sphingobium chungbukense DJ77.
This strain exhibited outstanding degradation capability for
various aromatic compounds. This study demonstrated the

naphthalene,andbiphenyls(PNB),andtheirassociatedproteins
was analyzed by 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. During

Comparative analysis of 2-DE results revealed that the intensity
of 10
protein spots changes identically upon exposure to
these xenobiotics in strain DJ77 (Lee et al., 2016b). Among
these
ten, ﬁve upregulated proteins with multiple functionalities
were identiﬁed as putative dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (BphB),
which catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of trans-
dihydrodiols; 2,3-dihydrobisphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase (PhnQ),
which cleaves the aromatic ring; and 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-
phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate hydrolase (BphD), which degrades
biphenyls and polychlorinated biphenyls. A part of the initial
diverse catabolism of PNB by BphB, PhnQ, and BphD
converged into the same catechol degradation branch. Now,
catechol is ﬁrst transformed into a ring-cleaved product, i.e.,
2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase
(PhnE). Moreover, it is assumed that this ring-cleaved product
(2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde) would be further degraded
by 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (PhnD), and
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (PhnI) into a compound that can
enter into the TCA cycle. Hence, these upregulated proteins,
dehydrogenase, dioxygenase, and hydrolase, are involved in the
catabolic degradation pathway of xenobiotics. The detection
of intermediates from 2,3-dihydroxy-biphenyl degradation to
pyruvate and acetyl-CoA by LC/MS analysis showed that ring-
cleavage products entered the TCA cycle and were mineralized
in strain DJ77. It was also suggested that strain DJ77 could
completely degrade a wide range of PAHs via multiple catabolic
pathways( Leeetal.,2016b).
The biode
gradation mechanism of tetrabromobis-phenol
A (TBBPA) was investigated in Phanerochaete chrysosporium
by using a proteomic approach. iTRAQ quantitative analysis
identiﬁed a total of 2,724 proteins in three biological samples.
Compared to control TBBPA, stress caused 148 diﬀerentially
expressedproteinsin P.chrysosporium,amongwhich90proteins
were upregulated and 58 proteins were downregulated. The
upregulation of cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, glutathione-
S-transferase, O-methyltransferase, and other oxidoreductases is
responsible for the biotransformation of TBBPA via oxidative
hydroxylationandreductivedebromination( Chenetal.,2019).
A biodegrad
ation study of endocrine-disrupting compound
4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP) by ﬁlamentous fungus Metarhizium
robertsii was investigated by Szewczyk et al. (2014) with
proteomicanalysis.
Thissuggestedthatthemainbiodegradation
mechanism involves the consecutive oxidation of the alkyl
chain and benzene, which consequently results in the complete
decomposition of the 4-n-NP compound. Proteomic proﬁling
exploredtheinvolvementofnitro-reductase-likeproteinsrelated
to the oxidation–reduction and ROS defense systems, and
mainly engaged group of proteins in the removal of 4-n-NP.
Proteomic data obtained in this study could not clearly explain
the mechanism of 4-n-NP biodegradation in the tested fungal
strain, but allowed for the formulation of hypotheses that the
over-expressed enzymes in the cultures with 4-n-NP could play
aroleinxenobioticremovalandthebiodegradationprocess.
Bioremediation of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209)
was explored in Microbacterium Y2 in a polluted water-
sediment system through proteomics (Yu Y. et al., 2019).
Proteomic analysis
showed that the overexpression of haloaciddehalogenases, glutathione s-transferase, and ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter might occupy important roles in
BDE-209 biotransformation. Moreover, heat-shock proteins
(HSPs), ribonuclease E, oligoribonuclease (Orn), and ribosomal
proteins were activated to counter the BDE-209 toxicity. Thus,
it is suggested that these proteins are implicated in microbial
degradation, antioxidative stress, and glycolysis ( Yu Y. et al.,
2019).
Metabolomics
Meta
bolomics is a well-established recent scientiﬁc technology,
attributedtowardthestudyofnaturallyoccurringlow-molecular
weight(<1,000Da)organicmetabolites(organicacids;pyruvate,
lactate, malate, formate, fatty acid-like acetate, etc.) inside a
tissue, cell, or bioﬂuid ( Johnson et al., 2011; Malla et al., 2018;
Wither
s et al., 2020). Metabolomics explores the relationships
between or
ganisms and the environment, such as organismal
responsestoabioticstressors,includingbothnaturalfactorssuch
as temperature, and anthropogenic factors such as pollution,
to investigate biotic–biotic interactions such as infections, and
metabolic responses ( Lindon et al., 2006; Griﬃths, 2007; Mallick
etal.,
2019).
The combined
use of metabolomics with these applications
details the authentic collection of chemical outputs and
inputs, which arbitrate the exchange of resources between the
community and its host (Table4; Theriot et al., 2014; Wang
Y. F.
et al., 2018). Metabolomic studies in environmental
sciences
have been directed toward understanding changes in
theconcentrationofmetabolitesassociatedwithexposingmodel
organisms to toxic compounds, such as xenobiotics (Parisi et al.,
2009;Seo
etal.,2009).
Meta
bolomics approach was utilized to investigate the
degradation mechanism of carbaryl and other N-methyl
carbamates pesticides in Burkholderia sp. strain C3 (Seo et al.,
2013).
Metabolomes are dynamic and responsive to nutrient
and environment
al changes. The results of this study showed
the metabolic adaptation of Burkholderia sp. C3 to carbaryl
in comparison with glucose and nutrient broth. The metabolic
changes were notably associated with the biosynthesis and
metabolism of amino acids, sugars, PAH lipids, and cofactors.
Diﬀerential metabolome analysis in response to diﬀerent
substrates identiﬁed 196 polar metabolites, 10 fatty acids, and
1 macromolecule (PHA) in this strain, and conﬁrmed up-
production metabolites in the pentose phosphate pathway,
cysteine metabolism, amino acids, and disaccharides ( Seo et al.,
2013).
Thus, this metabolomic study could provide detailed
insights
intobacterialadaptationtodiﬀerentmetabolicnetworks,

ofmesotrione,aherbicide.AnalysiswascarriedoutbyusingLC-
NMR and LC-MS, and the result of these instrumental analyses
was the identiﬁcation of six metabolites, of which the structures
of four metabolites were suggested. Szewczyk et al. (2017)
performed metabolic analysis of fungal strain Met arhizium
brunneum ARSEF 2017 to predict a biodegradation-pathway
metabolic background for the removal of ametryn, an s-
triazene herbicide. Qualitative LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis
of ametryn biodegradation resulted in the generation of four
metabolites,i.e.,2-hydroxyatrazine,ethylhydroxylatedametryn,
S-demethylatedametryn,anddiethylametryn.
Wright et al. (2020) evaluated the metabolomic
chara
cterization of two potent marine bacterial isolates,
Mycobacterium sp. DBP42 and Halomonas sp. ATBC28, capable
of the degradation of phthalate and plasticizers such as ATBC,
DBP, and DEHP. That study presented the molecular analysis of
metabolites generated during biodegradation. A metabolomic
studyconﬁrmedthatDBPandATBCweredegradedthroughthe
sequentialremovalofestersidechains,andgeneratedmonobutyl
phthalate and phthalate in the case of DBP degradation, and
citrate in the case of ATBC degradation in Mycobacterium sp.
However, DEHP degradation did not follow the same pathway
as that observed for DBP and ATBC. It was suggested that
DEHP degradation is initiated through hydroxylation of the
ester side chain by monooxygenase, and may occur via the
β-oxidation of fatty acid side chains directly on the DEHP
molecule. Moreover, in comparison with Mycobacterium sp.,
Halomonas sp. did not conﬁrm any detectable degradation
intermediates for the degradation of plasticizers and phthalate,
but it harbored an array of enzymes suggested to be responsible
for the degradation of other aromatic compounds. Therefore,
metabolomic analyses demonstrated changes that occur in the
composition of metabolites, aiding to fully understand the shifts
mechanisms of metabolites during the microbial degradation or
mineralization of environmental pollutants ( Lindon et al., 2006;
Keumet
al.,2008;d’Erricoetal.,2020).
BIOINFORMATICS
Bioinformatic
technology developed a new array of
computational technologies that uses both information
technology and biological sciences. This modern technology
seeks information from multiple high-throughput biological
techniques, and keeps all biological data, helping to investigate
and decide the relationship among organic molecules, including
macromolecular sequences, biochemical and metabolic
pathways, protein expressions, metabolites, and structures
(FulekarandGeetha,2008;Cooperetal.,2018;Dangietal.,2018;
Greene,2018;
Shekhar et al., 2020 ). Enormous amounts of data

etal.,

important
to understand the bioremediation of toxic pollutants.
Bioinformatics provides superior information regarding the
cellular,molecular,andgeneticalbasesofxenobioticdegradation
anddetoxiﬁcation(Kumaretal.,2016;Huangetal.,2020).There
are a

(Pazos et al., 2005). For the analysis of biodegradation studies,
many bioinformatic
resources are exclusively available. The
University of Minnesota Biocatalysts/Biodegradation Database
(UM-BBD) was introduced in 1995 and contains information
regarding microbial catabolism and related biotransformation,
biodegradation reactions, catabolic enzymes, and pathways
for xenobiotics and other hazardous pollutants of various
microorganisms. This database is connected to several other
databases, such as BRENDA, ENZYME, ExPASy, and NCBI,
to collect and store information related to gene structure and
enzymes that take part in the biodegradation of environmental
contaminants ( Ellis et al., 2006). Genomic sequences of
microorg
anisms with competent and eﬃcient degradation
abilities could be easily investigated via another widely used
database, the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI).Itgivesadetailedandcompletepipelineforannotations,
and comprehensive analysis of more than 6,000 microbial
genomes ( Brown et al., 2015). PRIDE (Vizcaino et al., 2016)
is t
he world’s largest data repository of mass-spectroscopy-
based proteomic data, and MetaboLights (Kale et al., 2016) is a
data
baseformetabolomicexperimentsandderivedinformation.
The GenBank database is freely available in NCBI, and it
provides most up-to-date and comprehensive DNA sequence
information (Benson et al., 2013). Recently, there have been
a number of
databases such as CAMERA, MG-RAST, and
IMG/M that were developed and employed for the analysis
and in-depth understanding of diverse microbial populations,
metabolicreconstruction,taxonomicaﬃliations,andtheirinter-
and intra-relationship networks. Another database, Bionemo,
developed by the structural computational-biology group at the
Spanish National Cancer Research Center, gives information
related to speciﬁc genes and proteins that take part in
biodegradation reactions and metabolic pathways ( Carbajosa
etal.,
2009).Itprovidesinsightsintosequences,domains,protein
structures,
and regulatory elements, and transcription factors
for their respective genes. Integrated bioinformatic approaches
are employed for the metagenomic characterization of the soil

CONCLUSIONS
Microbial communities have great potential to mediate the
successful biodegradation process of xenobiotic-contaminated
soil/water environments. However, the greater part of
mainstream microorganisms involved in bioremediationare still undeﬁned because not all organisms in nature could
be cultured under in vitroenvironments, but reside in viable-
but-non-culturable (VBNC) environments. Thus, to explore the
hidden knowledge of these VBNC organisms, recent advanced
practices and sophisticated up-to-date technologies are highly
desirable to understand the genetic and molecular biology of
microorganisms. Newly developed molecular techniques oﬀer
promising approaches to address the in-depth characterization
of microbial communities from molecule to gene. Recent
omics technologies such as metagenomics, transcriptomics,
and proteomics are helpful in obtaining information about
nucleic acids, enzymes, catabolic genes, plasmids, and
metabolic machineries and metabolites generated during

the biodegradation process. However, the solitary employment
of any
individual omics technology is not suﬃcient to explore
or illustrate secret information regarding microbial-remediation
practices. Therefore, an interdisciplinary application of multiple
omics studies highlights the perspectives of system biology for
providing an integrative understanding between genes, proteins,
and environmental factors responsible for the whole microbial-
degradationprocess,andgivesanewarrayofnoveltechnologies,
such as genome-editing and next-generation-sequencing tools
CRISPR-Cas9,TALEN,andZFNs,whicharepotentgene-editing
tools that design microbes with speciﬁc degradation-function
genes and provide unique insights into microbial remediation.
Moreover, the successful execution of omics technologies could
not be possible without the use of bioinformatic tools. The
establishment of informative genomic and proteomic databases
has been revolutionized by bioinformatics, which facilitates
broad information about cellular- and metabolic-mechanism
pathways for environmental pollutants. Hence, the involvement
of these advanced technologies in the biological sciences shows
the way to next-level research in the bioremediation potential
of microorganisms, and exploits their capability to remove
xenobioticcontamination.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT

Hydrocarbon contamination emerging from the crude oil industrial-related activities
has led to severe environmental issues. Prolonged contamination with the constant
inﬁltration of crude oil into the soil is a severe problem in remediating contaminated
soils. Hence, the current study focuses on comparing various bioremediation strategies,
thereby isolating native bacteria competent to reduce TPH in both liquid and microcosm
environments in an old-aged petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil. Assays in
the modiﬁed 6SW-Vit medium after 7 days of incubation revealed that Bacillus
altitudinis strain HRG-1 was highly hydrophobic and had a suitable ability to decrease
surface tension (40.98%) and TPH (73.3%). The results of biodegradation in the
microcosm proved that among the designated treatments, including bio-stimulated
microcosm (SM), bacterialized microcosm (BM), a combined bio-stimulated microcosm
and bacterialized microcosm (SB), and natural attenuation (NA), the SB treatment was
the most effective in mitigating TPH (38.2%). However, the SM treatment indicated the
lowest TPH biodegradation (18%). Pearson correlation coefﬁcient among microcosm
biological indicators under investigation revealed that soil basal respiration had the
highest correlation with the amount of residual TPH (r = 0.73915, P<0.0001),
followed by the microbial population (r = 0.65218, P<0.0001), catalase activity
(r= 0.48323, P= 0.0028), polyphenol oxidase activity (r = 0.43842, P= 0.0075),
and dehydrogenase activity (r = 0.34990, P= 0.0364), respectively. Nevertheless,
considering the capability of strain HRG-1 and the higher efﬁciency of the combined
technique, their use is recommended to diminish the concentration of petroleum
hydrocarbons in hot and dry contaminated areas.

INTRODUCTION
Total petroleum hydrocarbons are one of the most momentous contaminants in the environment.
Considering the harmful eﬀects of crude oil leakage on the region’s ecosystem, it is necessary
to remove them from the environment. One of the most eﬀective, low-cost, and applicable
techniques to remove contaminants is called bioremediation. Bioremediation denotes the use of

Garousin et al. Mitigation of Old-Aged Petroleum Contaminants
living indigenous or exogenous microorganisms with the
property of degradation of contaminants or improvement
of various physical-chemical soil conditions to stimulate the
growth of eﬃcient microorganisms (Wilson and Jones, 1993;
MarGesin et al., 2000). Solving the contamination problem has
attracted many researchers’ attention in recent years; however,
the aging of organic contaminants and the successive entry of
petroleum hydrocarbons into the soil have been less discussed
and investigated.
Numerous studies have reported using diﬀerent
bioremediation strategies in petroleum-contaminated soils,
each of which presenting diﬀerent results. For instance, Liu
et al. (2011) said bioaugmentation as a superior strategy, while
in another study, Wu et al. (2019) considered biostimulation a
preferable approach. In other researchers’ works, the combined
bioaugmentation and biostimulation has been proposed as the
most eﬃcient strategy (Varjani and Upasani, 2019).
The core problem facing bioremediation is the aging
phenomenon of organic contaminants in the soil. As time passes,
it becomes laborious to separate the hydrocarbon contaminant
from the soil matrix. With these contaminants’ inﬁltration
into soil organic matter and soil pores, their extraction ability
and accessibility for microorganisms and other environmental
receptors are reduced (Tang et al., 2012). Due to the complexity
of old-contaminants’ behavior in the soil, more robust strategies
are needed for the bioremediation of these contaminants. Many
studies have been conducted on artiﬁcial soil contamination
(Kang et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2018; Baoune et al., 2019),
and soils with extremely old and natural contamination have
not been investigated enough, and if so, the duration of the
contamination has not been clearly mentioned (Dandie et al.,
2010; Dong et al., 2013; Lominchar et al., 2018; Liu et al.,
2019; Gou et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). However, there
are many areas suﬀering from long-term contamination of
crude oil and its products, and failure to address this issue
can exert irreversible eﬀects. Therefore, the simultaneous use
of diﬀerent bioremediation strategies can be more eﬀective in
solving this problem.
Another problem of contaminated soils in hot-dry areas
is the salinity eﬀect. High salinity inhibits the growth
of microorganisms, increases the adaptation time of
microorganisms to new conditions, and reduces the intensity
and amount of biodegradation (Qin et al., 2012). Nonetheless,
to analyze soil contaminants’ changes resulting from the use
of single or combined bioremediation techniques, various
biological indicators such as soil basal respiration, microbial
population, and enzymatic activity have been examined (Abed
et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017). Numerous studies have reported
a strong correlation (positive or negative) between the amount
of petroleum hydrocarbons and soil enzymes (Ma et al., 2014;
Khan et al., 2015; Ebadi et al., 2017). However, the quantity of the
correlation coeﬃcient between soil enzymes and the amount of
hydrocarbon contaminants, especially in old-aged contaminated
soils, has been less discussed. To evaluate the result of soil
bioremediation, it is necessary to consider the amount of residual
hydrocarbons, and to determine the eﬀect of contaminants on
the biological activity of soil microorganisms. This elaboratesan insight into the health condition of soil microorganisms
(MarGesin et al., 2000).
The present study aimed to reduce TPH in both microcosm
and culture media by a capable bacterial strain and add various
supplements to increase biodegradation of contaminants in an
old-aged petroleum contaminated saline-sodic soil (more than
60 years of contamination). Additionally, various soil biological
indicators such as several enzyme activities, soil basal respiration,
and microbial population were investigated to achieve the most
appropriate one in showing TPH variations in an old-aged
petroleum contaminated soil. To that end, the relationship
between the soil biological characteristics and the amount
of residual TPH was examined using the Pearson product-
moment correlation.
This study was conducted to answer fundamental questions,
including (a) which bioremediation strategy has a more
inﬂuential role in reducing TPH in a highly contaminated aged
soil? (b) could this soil with such a long history of contamination
be remediated by only one strain or not?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Soil Sampling and Characterization
Sampling was carried out in crude oil-contaminated saline
and sodic soil with more than 60 years of contamination
(ranging from 0 to 20 cm depth) around one of the oil
exploitation wells located in Ahvaz oilﬁeld (southwestern Iran).
The samples were transferred to the laboratory and stored at
4C until the experiments were performed. The main physical-
chemical parameters of the soil were investigated using standard
methods (Sparks, 1996). Table 1 presents the properties of the
contaminated soil.
Culture Medium and Materials
The modiﬁed 6SW-Vit medium (McGenity and Gramain, 2010)
containing three solutions was used for biodegradation assays.
Solution A contained (g 800 ml 1) 30 NaCl, 10 MgCl 2.6H 2O,
2.53 KCl, 2.18 Na 2SO4, 20 ml Tris–HCl (1 M; pH 7.6),
0.5 yeast extract. Solution B contained (ml 100 ml 1) 0.6 H 3BO 3
(400 mM), 0.7 SrCl 2(400 mM), 0.7 NaF (70 mM), 1 NH 4Cl
(500 mM), 1 KH 2PO 4(100 mM), two trace element solution
SL-10, and solution C contained (ml 100 ml 1) 10 CaCl 2.2H 2O
(1 M). First, the solutions were separately autoclaved and
thereafter mixed, when they were cooled down. Trace element
solution SL-10 contained (per L) 10 ml HCl (25%; 7.7 M), 1.5 g
FeCl 2.4H 2O, 70 mg ZnCl 2, 100 mg MnCl 2.4H 2O, 6 mg H 3BO 3,
190 mg CoCl 2.6H 2O, 2 mg CuCl 2.2H 2O, 24 mg NiCl 2.6H 2O,
36 mg Na 2MoO 4.2H 2O. Finally, pH was adjusted to the range of
7–7.2. All solvents, acids, inorganic salts and Tween 80 nonionic
surfactant were purchased from Merck Co., and the heavy Persian
crude oil was used in this study.
Enrichment and Isolation Process
During the enrichment process, 10 g of crude oil-contaminated
soil was transferred to a 500-ml ﬂask containing 100 ml of the
modiﬁed 6SW-Vit medium with 1% crude oil as a sole source

of carbon. The samples were incubated for 7 days in a shaker
incubator (150 rpm and 40C). To complete the enrichment
process, 10 ml of the enriched medium was transferred to 90 ml
of the fresh saline medium under all previous conditions, and
this operation was repeated four times. Upon completion of the
enrichment process, a serial dilution was prepared from the ﬁnal
enriched culture medium and transferred to plates containing the
modiﬁed 6SW-Vit agar culture medium. To select the superior
isolate, the ability to degrade crude oil was assessed by pure
isolates isolated from the enrichment process using the turbidity
method (spectrophotometer JENWAY 6705 UV/Vis) in the 6SW-
Vit culture medium (Kumar et al., 2008).
Biochemical and 16S rRNA
Characterization
For primary identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of the bacterial
strain, various biochemical analyzes were conducted (Krieg and
Manual, 1984). Qiagen kit Cat. No. 51504 was used to extract the
total genomic DNA of the bacterial strain. The 16S rRNA gene of
pure isolates was ampliﬁed, and then the puriﬁed PCR products
were sequenced by Microsynth Company (Balgach, Switzerland).
EzBioCloud and BLAST databases were used to determine the
similarity of the sequence to other sequences of known bacteria.Analyses in Culture Medium
Evaluation of Crude Oil Biodegradation
To select the highest biodegraded concentration of crude oil,
four crude oil concentrations [0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 (V / V)] were
designated, and according to the spectrophotometric method
(Rahman et al., 2002), the optimal concentration was determined.
To more accurately investigate biodegradation, the selected
optimal concentration of crude oil was poured in a 250-
ml Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 50 ml of a modiﬁed 6SW-
Vit medium, and the superior isolate (4% V) was inoculated
in it with the initial population of 4.1 107CFU/ml. The
specimens were incubated in a shaker incubator (150 rpm
and 40C) for 7 days. After the incubation period, to evaluate
the reduction in TPH, the specimens were dehydrated and
deasphaltenated by anhydrous sodium sulfate and a PTFE
syringe ﬁlter (0.45 mm, membrane solution), respectively. A GC-
FID (Gas chromatography ﬂame ionization detector) device
(AGILENT, 6890N, HP5 column, United States) was used to
measure the residual concentration of TPH.
Cell Surface Hydrophobicity Assays
Bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons (BATH) test was used to
measure cells’ hydrophobicity with two diﬀerent types of solvents
(hexane as a nonpolar and dichloromethane as a polar solvent).
The trend of changes in the hydrophobicity of the cell surface was
examined every 24 h over a week. Bacterial cells were precipitated
by centrifuging (TOMY SEIKO CO., LTD, RS-20IV) at 6,000 g
for 20 min and washed twice with saline solution. The cells
were kept in a buﬀer saline solution (pH = 7) containing 16.9 g
L 1K2HPO 4, 7.3 g L 1KH 2PO 4, 1.8 g L 1urea, and 0.2 g
L 1MgSO 4.7H 2O to achieve OD = 0.3 at 600 nm wavelength.
Furthermore, 3 ml of the prepared culture medium and the same
amount of hydrocarbons (n-hexane and dichloromethane) were
poured into the test tubes, and after 5 min, they were mixed
with a vortex at high speed for 60 s. After keeping the test tubes
at room temperature (15 min) and measuring their turbidity at
600 nm, the percentage of hydrophobicity was calculated using
the following equation (Rosenberg et al., 1980).
Percentage of hydrophobicity D.1 .X=X0//100
Xis the optical density of the aqueous phase after addition of
n-hexane and dichloromethane. X0is the optical density of the
primary aqueous phase.
The percentage of the cells moved to the hydrocarbon phase
indicates cell-surface hydrophobicity.
Biosurfactant Production Analyses and Surface
Tension Measurement
The oil displacement analysis was conducted by ﬁrst pouring
40 ml of distilled water into a petri dish (150 mm diameter) and
then pouring 40 ml of crude oil onto it to form a thin layer of
oil on the surface of the distilled water. Additionally, 10 ml of the
cell-free modiﬁed 6SW-Vit medium were gently poured from a
suitable height onto a Petri dish’s center. At the end, the diameter
of the clear halo zone was measured as a qualitative indicator of
biosurfactant production (Morikawa et al., 2000).

To investigate the hemolytic activity of the cells, the blood
agar medium (5% sheep’s blood) was used to culture the bacterial
strain. Then, it was incubated at 30C for 48 h. The clear
zone formed around the colony represents the production of
biosurfactant (Carrillo et al., 1996).
The Wilhelmy plate method (KRUSS tesiometer) was
also used to determine surface tension according to
(Rosenberg et al., 1980).
Analyses in Microcosm
Microcosm Design
Four treatments were designed in this study including 1: bio-
stimulated microcosm (SM) with substances such as Tween
80 surfactant (1% V/W), NH 4NO 3as a source of nitrogen
and KH 2PO 4as a source of phosphorus, 2: bacterialized
microcosm (BM) (10% V/W) with an initial population of
5.4108CFU/ml, 3: combined bio-stimulated microcosm and
bacterialized microcosm (SB) and 4: natural attenuation (NA).
To prepare the designed treatments, 100 g of the contaminated
soil was poured into each jar, and the humidity in all treatments
was considered 65% ﬁeld capacity (FC). The C/N/P ratio of
the soil was adjusted to 100/10/2 in the bio-SM. All treatments
were incubated in a dark environment at 40C for 60 days,
and every 20 days, the activity of soil enzymes (dehydrogenase,
polyphenol oxidase, and catalase), soil basal respiration, soil
bacterial population, and biodegradation rate of TPH were
examined. The treatments were exposed to the open air for
10 min every 7 days to provide oxygen, and the moisture content
was adjusted to the desired amount every 7 days.
Enzymatic Analyses
To determine dehydrogenase activity, 3 g of the moist soil
sample was thoroughly mixed with 30 mg CaCO 3, and then
0.5 ml of 3% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and 1.25 ml
distilled water were added to each sample and incubated for
24 h at 37C. Afterward, 10 ml of methanol was added to each
sample and thoroughly mixed by Vortex, and then centrifuged
at 4,000 rpm (15 min) for the precipitation process. Absorbance
in the extract was measured at 485 nm (Casida et al., 1964).
Eventually, dehydrogenase activity was determined as mg TPF
g 1moist soil h 1.
To evaluate polyphenol oxidase activity, 1 g of the moist soil
was poured into 50-ml glass falcons. Then 10 ml of the pyrogalic
acid solution (1%) was added to it, mixed well and incubated at
30C for 1 h. Subsequently, 2.5 ml of HCl (0.5 M) was gently
added to it, and the resulting solution was extracted by ether
with a separatory funnel. The organic phase was collected and
spectrophotometrically read at 430 nm. The control had all the
above conditions, and only 10 ml of distilled water was used
instead of 10 ml of pyrogalic acid (Ma et al., 2003). Polyphenol
oxidase activity was expressed as mg purpurogallin g 1moist soil
h 1.
To assay catalase activity, 2 g of the moist soil with 40 ml
of distilled water, and 5 ml of H 2O2(0.3%) were mixed and
shaken (150 rpm, 20 min) and immediately after shaking, 5 ml
of H 2SO4(3 M) was added to prevent further decomposition of
H2O2. Finally, the resulting product was ﬁltered, and 25 ml ofthe ﬁltered solution was titrated with KMnO 4(0.1 N) (Lin et al.,
2009). Catalase activity was conveyed as ml KMnO 4g 1moist
soil h 1.
Soil Basal Respiration and Bacterial Population
100 g of the contaminated soil was poured in sterile glass jars
closed with lids and then, NaOH (0.2 mol/l) was used to trap the
CO 2evolved from the soil incubation experiment. Finally, The
NaOH solution was titrated by 0.1 M HCl, and it was presented
as mg CO 2/kg soil/h (Schinner et al., 2012).
Soil microbial population was evaluated using the standard
plate count (SPC) method with plates containing the modiﬁed
6SW-Vit agar culture medium.
TPH Biodegradation
Soil treatments were extracted every 20 days by ultrasound
(Hielscher, UP400S, 400 W, 24 KHz) to measure biodegradation
of TPH. Brieﬂy, 4 g of the contaminated soil was mixed with a
mixture of dichloromethane and acetone solvents (10:10 ml). For
the dehydration process, 2 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate was
added to the samples. The samples were then extracted (20 min,
twice) and centrifuged (4,000 rpm, 10 min). The organic phase
was transferred to other glass Falcons and spectrophotometrically
read at a wavelength of 420 nm (Rahman et al., 2002).
Statistical Analyses
This study was conducted as a factorial experiment in a
completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications.
Before analysing variance, normality of distribution of the data
(Jarque-Bera test), and homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test)
were analyzed using XLSTAT 2019, and SPSS 21, respectively.
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) was conducted
to evaluate the interaction between microcosm treatments
and diﬀerent times (SAS 9.4). Duncan’s post hoc test was
applied to compare among multiple groups (SAS 9.4). Pearson
product-moment correlation was conducted to determine
the relationships between the studied microcosm biological
characteristics and the amount of residual TPH (SAS 9.4).
Probability levels of 0.01 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Microsoft Excel software 2013 was used to draw graphs.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Selection and Identiﬁcation of Bacterial
Strain
The enrichment process only yielded two isolates after 5 weeks.
The turbidity results indicated that merely one of the two isolates
was eﬃcient enough to create turbidity so that it was selected
as the superior isolate for further studies. The 16S rRNA gene
sequencing results signiﬁed our strain’s highest aﬃnity (100%)
with Bacillus altitudinis strain 41KF2b.T/under the accession
number of ASJC01000029. The strain was registered in the gene
bank under B. altitudinis strain HRG-1.T/under the accession
number of MN590432. This strain was seamlessly nurtured in the
pH range of 5.5 to 8.5 (optimum pH = 7), NaCl concentrations
of 0 to 5% (optimum 3%) and temperature range of 20 to

biochemical characteristics of the strain HRG-1.
Biodegradation of TPH in the Modiﬁed
6SW-Vit Medium
Among the four selected crude oil concentrations, 0.25%
displayed the highest amount of degradation in the liquid
medium; hence, it was selected as the optimal concentration
(Supplementary Figure 1). The GC-FID results revealed that the
HRG-1 strain could degrade 73.3% 6.58 of TPH in the modiﬁed
6SW-Vit medium after 7 days (Figure 1). In one study conducted
under optimal conditions, Liu et al. (2016), reported that after
5 days, Bacillus licheniformis strain Y-1 degraded 60.2% of crude
oil. In another study, after 12 days of incubation, Dietzia sp. Strain
CN-3 eﬃciently degraded 91.6% of crude oil (0.5% w/v) in the
liquid medium (180 rpm, 30C) (Chen et al., 2017).
Bacterial Adhesion to Hydrocarbons Test
Biosurfactants can be adsorbed by the cell surface, thereby
increasing cell surface hydrophobicity (Ahimou et al., 2000). Cell
surface hydrophobicity test is one of the exciting experiments
in environmental engineering and other microbial disciplines
(Saini, 2010). The results showed that the highest and lowest
hydrophobicity levels were related to dichloromethane solvent
(88.44%) on the 7 day, and (52.55%) on the 5 day of the
experiment, respectively (Figure 2A). No signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between dichloromethane and n-hexane was observed, except on
the 5th, 6th, and 7th days. The reason that such changes in target
hydrocarbons result in changes in hydrophobicity is probably

Evaluation of Oil Displacement,
Hemolytic Activity and Changes in
Surface Tension
The oil displacement test is a qualitative study of the presence
of biosurfactants in solution. The diameter of the clear zone on
the surface is directly related to the presence of biosurfactants
(Ibrahim et al., 2013). Our study indicated that the diameter of
the clear zone on the thin layer of oil was 31 mm, suggesting the
production of biosurfactants during the biodegradation of crude
oil (Supplementary Figure 2a).
Another hint for biosurfactant production is the lysis of red
blood cells; HRG-1 strain did it best and caused hemoglobin
breakdown (Supplementary Figure 2b). Consistent with the
classiﬁcations proposed by Carrillo et al. (1996) and creating a
white and clear zone around the colony, this strain was placed in
the type of b-hemolysis.
One of the core indicators of biosurfactants’ production
is a decrease in surface tension (Diniz Ruﬁno et al., 2014).
Biosurfactants boost hydrocarbon compounds’ surface area,
thereby allowing further degradation (Batista et al., 2006;
Hassanshahian et al., 2014). In this investigation, changes in
surface tension in the modiﬁed 6SW-Vit medium during 7 days
of biodegradation exhibited the highest surface tension related
to the initial time (47.81 mN/m), while the lowest one to the
7th day (28.22 mN/m). However, after 7 days, the surface tension
dropped by 40.98% (Figure 2B). In a study, Goswami and Deka
(2019) reported that after 48 h of incubation, biosurfactant
producing bacterium (B. altitudinis strain MS16) reduced the
surface tension of the culture medium from 72.8 to 32.3 mN/m.
Biological Assays in Crude
Oil-Contaminated Microcosm
In some cases, when the issue of oxidation of soil organic matter
is raised, dehydrogenase activity is a worthy indicator for organic
matter changes, particularly in petroleum-contaminated soils,
and it is part of the respiratory process of soil microorganisms
(Das and Varma, 2010). The results of this study displayed
that the amount of dehydrogenase activity (in all treatments)
at the end of the ﬁrst 20 days was higher than that at
the beginning of the experiment (99.6 2.82 mg TPF g 1
moist soil h 1). Nevertheless, in all treatments, the highest
and lowest dehydrogenase activity was observed in the ﬁrst
and third 20 days, respectively. Changes in dehydrogenase
activity throughout the experiment had a decreasing trend, being
consistent with the notions reported by Chen et al. (2019). The
highest dehydrogenase activity during the experimental period
was related to the BM treatment in the ﬁrst 20 days (276.5 mg
TPF g 1moist soil h 1). The lowest was related to the SM
treatment in the third 20 days (50.26 mg TPF g 1moist soil h 1).
The results clearly revealed that the application of biostimulation
prevented the increase of dehydrogenase activity during the
incubation period (Figure 3A).

Polyphenol oxidase plays a crucial role in the degradation of
aromatic hydrocarbons (phenolic compounds); it is an essential
indicator of microbial activity, particularly in contaminated soils
(Dindar et al., 2015). The results of the present study revealed
that the polyphenol oxidase activity in all treatments (except
SB) in the ﬁrst 20 days of incubation was increased compared
to its initial time (0.256 0.019 mg purpurogallin g 1moist
soil h 1). During 60 days of incubation, the lowest and thehighest polyphenol oxidase activity was associated with the SM
treatment (0.212 mg purpurogallin g 1moist soil h 1) in the
ﬁrst 20 days and the BM treatment (0.662 mg purpurogallin g 1
moist soil h 1) in the second 20 days, respectively (Figure 3C).
In their study, Wu et al. (2017) found that polyphenol oxidase
activity in all treatments reached its maximum on the 7th day.
Then, it rapidly dropped toward the end of the experiment,
being in line with the polyphenol oxidase activity changes in our

study. It is noteworthy that similar to dehydrogenase activity,
the application of biostimulation prohibited the increase of
polyphenol oxidase activity during the incubation period.
Catalase diminishes the harmful eﬀects of heavy metals
and hydrocarbons by performing its catalytic function in
the degradation of H 2O2; thus, it is interesting to study it
in contaminated soils (Achuba and Okoh, 2014). Its unique
characteristics such as time-consuming performance, low cost
and ease of use have made it highly useful to study catalase activity
(Chelikani et al., 2004). The results of this study presented that
the activity of catalase was decreased from the starting point
of the experiment (1.6 0.081 ml KMnO 4g 1moist soil
h 1) to the end of the second 20 days of incubation. However,
in the third 20 days, a slight increase in this enzyme activity
was detected compared to the second 20 days. The highest
and lowest catalase activity during the experimental period was
related to the NA treatment in the third 20 days (1.783 ml
KMnO 4g 1moist soil h 1), and the SB treatment in the
second 20 days (0.3 ml KMnO 4g 1moist soil h 1), respectively(Figure 3C). Wu et al. (2016), reported that the higher the
concentration of petroleum compounds is, the lower the catalase
activity is. Instead, other investigation proved that the higher
the concentration of petroleum compounds was, the higher the
catalase activity was (Borowik et al., 2017).
Soil basal respiration, and microbial structure and population
are acceptable criteria providing practical information on living
microorganisms and demonstrating the long-term or short-term
eﬀects of contaminants on microorganisms (Schaefer et al., 2005).
To provide a comprehensive deﬁnition of soil basal respiration,
one should refer to all metabolic reactions obtained from the
degradation of soil organic matter as a considerable indicator of
microorganisms’ activity in the soil, especially in contaminated
ones (Dos Santos et al., 2012). The results indicated that soil
respiration was gradually increased from the beginning of the
experiment (0.160.008 mg CO 2/kg soil/h) to the end of the
60th days of incubation in all treatments. Nonetheless, in the SB
treatment, the upward trend continued as far as the end of the
second 20 days, and then it was decreased. The maximum and
the minimum amount of soil respiration was related to the BM
treatment in the third 20 days (0.693 mg CO 2/kg soil/h) and
the SM treatment in the ﬁrst 20 days (0.226 mg CO 2/kg soil/h),
respectively (Figure 3D). However, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
the respiration rate was observed between BM and SB treatments
during the whole incubation period.
Toxic substances (petroleum-based hydrocarbons) can
dramatically decrease the activities and the eﬃciency of degrader
microorganisms, particularly when the organisms are inoculated
into contaminated soil or water (Mariano et al., 2007). Therefore,
an examination of the viability of the microorganisms provides
us with pivotal information during biodegradation. Consistent
with the initial soil bacterial population (1.4 0.368104CFU
/ g), the experiments showed that the largest and smallest
bacterial population was recorded in the BM treatment in the
second 20 days (4.3 106CFU / g) and the SM treatment in
the third 20 days (2 103CFU / g), respectively (Figure 3E).
During the incubation period, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was
observed between BM and SB treatments. However, the SM
treatment presented all the smaller microbial population
than the NA treatment did. Margesin (2000) revealed that
biostimulation had a signiﬁcant adverse eﬀect on the population
of degrading microorganisms, being consistent with the results
obtained in our study.
Biodegradation of TPH in Crude
Oil-Contaminated Microcosm
The older the soil organic contaminants are, the greater
their pernicious lingering in the soil is, and the lower their
degradability is (Hatzinger and Alexander, 1995). Under other
conditions, in saline soils, the diversity and population of
microorganisms remain low, and the solubility of petroleum
compounds and oxygen reduces, which in turn can reduce
the biodegradation of petroleum contaminants (Whitehouse,
1984). Moreover, considering the fact that this soil has been
contaminated with crude oil for more than 60 years and has
saline-sodic nature, removing the contamination from it is highly

challenging and requires the adoption of various biological
approaches. The results indicated that at the end of the 60th days
of incubation, SB, BM, NA, and SM treatments reduced TPH
by 38.2%3.43, 34.4%1.6, 18.2%5.99, and 18%3.11,
respectively (Figure 3F). Notably, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was
observed between SM and NA treatments at the end of the
incubation period, and our results remained skeptical about the
application of biostimulation alone as one of the bioremediation
strategies. In this study, contrary to other reports by Kauppiet al. (2011), Wu et al. (2016), the biostimulation strategy had a
negligible eﬀect on the biodegradation of TPH even lower than
NA had, which is due to the eﬀect of surfactant (tween 80) on
increasing the availability of contaminants (Cheng et al., 2008,
2017) and probably exposure of negligible soil microorganisms
to excessive toxicity of these contaminants. Another point is
that the preferential degradation of surfactants can also prevent
contaminants’ biodegradation (Li and Chen, 2009). For instance,
in an investigation reported by Bruheim et al. (1999), the use of
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 642215

Garousin et al. Mitigation of Old-Aged Petroleum Contaminants
the Corexit 9,527 reduced the biodegradation of alkanes in crude
oil. Some reports demonstrate the opposite eﬀect of Tween 80 on
the biodegradation of contaminants (Pathak et al., 2009). Another
assumption is that due to the large size of soil particles in this
investigation (sandy-loam), contaminants are separated much
easier from soil particles (Abdel-Moghny et al., 2012). However,
the eﬀect of the aforementioned and the surfactant usage might
all the more increase the availability of contaminants, thereby
exposing the small number of soil microorganisms to excessive
toxicity. Interestingly, the results showed that in soils with a low
population of native microorganisms, the use of biostimulation
alone is not appropriate and capable microorganisms must be
used for bioremediation process.
This study, as in some other studies, Garg et al. (2016),
Roy et al. (2018), Varjani and Upasani (2019), Zeneli et al.
(2019), shows that a combined strategy is the best technique
to degrade hydrocarbon contaminants from the environment,
especially in soils with old as well as excessive contamination.
However, to achieve more signiﬁcant biodegradation in old
petroleum-contaminated soils, the use of potent microorganisms
must be considered. Considering the limited reports on
the performance of B. altitudinis in the bioremediation of
hydrocarbon compounds (Yetti et al., 2016; Shahzad et al., 2020),
this is the ﬁrst report on the eﬀectiveness of this strain in
reducing TPH in highly contaminated aged soils with a high
amount of salinity.
Correlation and Analysis of Variance
The results of a correlation between soil biological indicators
(enzymatic activities, soil basal respiration, and microbial
population) and the amount of residual TPH in the
microcosm environment showed a weak negative correlation
for dehydrogenase activity (r = 0.34990, P= 0.0364), a
moderate negative correlation for polyphenol oxidase activity
(r= 0.43842, P= 0.0075), a moderate positive correlation for
catalase activity (r = 0.48323, P= 0.0028), a strong negative
correlation for soil respiration (r = 0.73915, P<0.0001),
and a moderate negative correlation for bacterial population
(r= 0.65218, P<0.0001). However, among the studied
enzymes, dehydrogenase activity demonstrated the lowest
correlation with the soil residual TPH content. Contrary to
dehydrogenase and polyphenol oxidase activities with a weaker
and negative correlation, catalase exhibited a stronger and
positive correlation than the other two enzymes did. However,
the results proved that the most reliable biological indicator in
correlation with the soil residual TPH is the soil basal respiration.
The results of analysis of variance showed that the eﬀects
of treatment and time were individually signiﬁcant for all
microcosm indicators under investigation during the experiment
period at (P0.0001). The results of the interaction between
treatments and times showed that catalase (F = 6.3, P= 0.0004)
and soil basal respiration (F = 6.2, P= 0.0005) were signiﬁcant
at the 1% probability level (P 0.01), but the other biological
indicators were not signiﬁcant (dehydrogenase (F = 2.06,
P= 0.096), polyphenol oxidase (F = 2.48, P= 0.052), microbial
population (F = 2.08, P= 0.093), and biodegradation of TPH
(F= 1.4, P= 0.255).CONCLUSION
In the present study, due to the long aging of soil contaminants,
SB was the most eﬀective and robust strategy to reduce
TPH (38.2%) over a 60-day period. In heavily old aged
petroleum-contaminated soils, considering the small number
of native soil microorganisms as the main limiting factor for
the bioremediation process, the biostimulation strategy alone
was insuﬃcient and not recommended. However, no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in alleviating TPH was observed between SM and
NA treatments at the end of the experiment. Regarding the
vast diﬀerence in mitigating TPH between bacterial inoculated
treatments and bio-stimulated treatment alone, it is concluded
that the use of suitable microorganisms is necessary to reduce
contamination in such soils. Therefore, the results indicated
that the hydrophobic and biosurfactant-producing strain HRG-
1 could play a pivotal role to remediate highly contaminated aged
soils. The statistical analysis revealed that catalase had the highest
correlation (positive) with the amount of soil residual TPH only
in the studied enzymes. However, soil basal respiration indicated
that it was more reliable than the other biological indicators were
regarding its correlation with the amount of residual TPH in this
soil with such a long history in terms of contamination.

Low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) like naphthalene
and substituted naphthalenes (methylnaphthalene, naphthoic acids, 1-naphthyl
N-methylcarbamate, etc.) are used in various industries and exhibit genotoxic,
mutagenic, and/or carcinogenic effects on living organisms. These synthetic organic
compounds (SOCs) or xenobiotics are considered as priority pollutants that pose
a critical environmental and public health concern worldwide. The extent of
anthropogenic activities like emissions from coal gasiﬁcation, petroleum reﬁning, motor
vehicle exhaust, and agricultural applications determine the concentration, fate, and
transport of these ubiquitous and recalcitrant compounds. Besides physicochemical
methods for cleanup/removal, a green and eco-friendly technology like bioremediation,
using microbes with the ability to degrade SOCs completely or convert to non-
toxic by-products, has been a safe, cost-effective, and promising alternative.
Various bacterial species from soil ﬂora belonging to Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas,
Pseudoxanthomonas, Comamonas, Burkholderia, and Novosphingobium), Firmicutes
(Bacillus and Paenibacillus), and Actinobacteria (Rhodococcus and Arthrobacter )
displayed the ability to degrade various SOCs. Metabolic studies, genomic and
metagenomics analyses have aided our understanding of the catabolic complexity
and diversity present in these simple life forms which can be further applied for
efﬁcient biodegradation. The prolonged persistence of PAHs has led to the evolution of
new degradative phenotypes through horizontal gene transfer using genetic elements
like plasmids, transposons, phages, genomic islands, and integrative conjugative
elements. Systems biology and genetic engineering of either speciﬁc isolates or mock
community (consortia) might achieve complete, rapid, and efﬁcient bioremediation of
these PAHs through synergistic actions. In this review, we highlight various metabolic
routes and diversity, genetic makeup and diversity, and cellular responses/adaptations
by naphthalene and substituted naphthalene-degrading bacteria. This will provide
insights into the ecological aspects of ﬁeld application and strain optimization for
efﬁcient bioremediation.
Keywords: biodegradation, metabolic pathways, genetic diversity, gene transfer mechanisms, cellular responses

Mohapatra and Phale Microbial Degradation of Naphthalene and Substituted Naphthalenes
INTRODUCTION
The rapid expansion of industries (petrochemical, agricultural,
pharmaceutical, textile and dyes, cosmetic, etc.) has led to
global economic prosperity and better living standards. This
exponential development has resulted in the generation of a
huge volume of synthetic organic compounds (SOCs) which
are used in the manufacturing of various products. These
xenobiotics or SOCs include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), pesticides, herbicides, plasticizers, dyes, pharmaceutical
products, organophosphates, ﬂame retardants, volatile organic
solvents, etc. Their release into atmospheric, aquatic, and
terrestrial ecosystems exerts multidimensional eﬀects by altering
physicochemical properties and community structure and
wielding deleterious eﬀects on various living forms (Petrie
et al., 2015; Bernhardt et al., 2017; Sarkar et al., 2020). Many
aromatic pollutants have shown critical and deteriorating
eﬀects on a number of pristine ecosystems/biodiversity hot
spots like coral reefs, Arctic/Antarctic ice caps, high-altitude
lakes, deep sea sediment, etc. (Jones, 2010; Beyer et al., 2020;
Nordborg et al., 2020). Recent geomicrobiological studies have
shown that the deposition of synthetic organics (like aromatic
pollutants) and its derivatives on the surface of human-built
structures (built environment), i.e., cultural heritages and
granitic/stone/wooden/metal monuments, is accelerating its
decay (Gadd, 2017; Liu et al., 2018). Human activities can
enhance and intensify the biodeterioration of monuments
and structures through atmospheric pollution and climate
change (Liu et al., 2020). These organic pollutants react with
each other in the presence of atmospheric water vapor and
get deposited on to the structures leading to physical and
chemical deterioration of the material. Biodeterioration has
been widely recognized as biologically induced undesirable
change in the appearance and properties of a material, aﬀecting
its preservation (Pochon and Jaton, 1967). Further microbial
inﬂuences (metabolism) of these compounds diminish structural
integrity, preservation, and cultural importance (Gadd, 2017;
Liu et al., 2018). On the other hand, in a few cases, microbial
adaptation on these structures and their response were found
to be beneﬁcial due to the formation of bioﬁlm and other
protective encrustations, lowering the decay/decomposition rate
(Martino, 2016). Therefore, eﬀective strategies for the long-term
sustainable conservation of stone/metal/wood monuments
require an in-depth understanding of the key processes involved.
Compared with natural processes (geological processes, wild
forest ﬁres, volcanic eruptions, plant and bacterial reactions),
anthropogenic activity results in the release of large quantities
of PAHs and other SOCs into the ecosystems. Many of the
PAHs used in agriculture (insecticides and pesticides like
DDT, atrazine, carbaryl, pentachlorophenols, etc.), industries
(crude oil, oil sludge/waste, petroleum-derived plastics,
polychlorinated biphenyls, plasticizers, detergents, disinfectants,
fumigants, fragrances, and preservatives), personal care products
(sunscreens, antiseptics, insect repellent, and polycyclic musks),
and ammunition (explosives such as 2,4,6-TNT) are potential
xenobiotics and impact the planetary health (Srogi, 2007;
Vamsee-Krishna and Phale, 2008; Petrie et al., 2015). This list canbe further broadened with compounds derived from petroleum
products (fuel oil, lubricants, asphaltene), high molecular weight
bioplastics, and ionic liquids (Amde et al., 2015). The list of a wide
spectrum of aromatic pollutants and its use in various industries
is depicted in Table 1. The recent past has also witnessed
the onset of ramped-up levels of anthropogenic emissions of
volatile organics along with CO 2and other greenhouse gases
(Dvorak et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the anthropogenic input
far exceeds the natural sources. In addition, a spectrum of
SOCs is found to be present persistently in many ecological
compartments and designated as emerging contaminants which
have shown adverse negative eﬀects on living community
(Figure 1). Environmental authorities like the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) have recognized
many of them as priority pollutants due to cytotoxic, genotoxic,
mutagenic, and carcinogenic activities. Thus, strict guidelines for
their disposal and eﬀective strategies for their cleanup/removal
from polluted ecosystems are demanded. Various physical and
chemical cleanup methods like pyrolysis, oxidative thermal
treatment, air-sparging, land-ﬁlling, incineration, etc., which
are ineﬀective and expensive, have led to the generation of
corrosive, toxic, and recalcitrant by-products. With the increase
in global environmental awareness, microbes with the ability to
degrade these pollutants and their derivatives (like halo-, nitro-,
alkyl-, and/or methyl-) have received an increasing attention
(Fennell et al., 2004; Haritash and Kaushik, 2009; Phale et al.,
2020; Sarkar et al., 2020; Schwanemann et al., 2020). The use
of these indigenous microbial candidates either alone or as
mixed culture (consortia) for the removal of aromatic pollutants
has been advantageous in terms of environmental safety, cost,
eﬃciency, eﬀectiveness, and sustainability. Researchers are
also exploring the combined application of microbiological
processes and electrochemical oxido-reduction methods, termed
as bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), as a promising technology
for pollutant treatment/removal (Huang et al., 2011). Due to its
high eﬃciency, low cost, environmental safety, ambient operating
temperatures with biologically compatible materials, and the
recovery of by-products of value (e.g., electricity, fuels, and
chemicals), BESs are gaining attention (Pant et al., 2012; Nazari
et al., 2020). The advent of high-throughput genome sequencing
and omics tools/techniques are signiﬁcantly adding new
information on genetic regulation and proteomic and ﬂuxomic
responses of several degrading microbes. The combination
of such tools with system biology is further expanding our
knowledge on the selection and ﬁne-tuning of target catabolic
pathways (as metabolic designing) of microbes for eﬀective
and eﬃcient biodegradation. In order to develop eﬀective
bioremediation strategies by suitable microbial candidate(s),
one needs to understand the biochemical potential, metabolic
diversity, and genetic makeup as well as the organism’s ecology
(auto-/syn-ecology).
In this review, we attempt to summarize the degradation
of simple PAHs like naphthalene and substituted naphthalenes
by various bacterial isolates with respect to metabolic pathways
and diversity, enzymes involved in the degradation, the genetic
makeup/content and diversity, cellular responses, and various
bioremediation aspects. Understanding at the biochemical and

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS: SOURCE,
FATE, AND IMPACT ON THE BIOSPHERE
The preponderance of toxic and hazardous aromatic compounds
(satisfying Huckel’s rule of 4 nC2pelectrons, n= 1, 2, 3, : : :)
is posing an alarming threat to various ecological compartments
like air, soil, sediment, and surface and groundwater (Puglisi et al.,
2007). With either single- (monocyclic) or multiple-benzene
rings (polycyclic) in linear, angular, or cluster arrangement,
these compounds have shown stability (persistence/recalcitrance)
in the environment due to higher negative resonance energy
and inertness (unreactive), which can be attributed to their
hydrophobicity and reduced state. Further substitution of
aromatic ring(s) by methyl (–CH 3), carboxyl (–COOH), hydroxyl
(–OH), or sulfonate (–HSO 3) groups renders them more stable,
with higher aﬃnity toward macromolecules and bioaccumulation
property in the biological systems (Seo et al., 2009; Phale
et al., 2020). Several of such low molecular weight polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (LMW-PAHs), viz. naphthalene and its
derivatives [methyl naphthalenes, naphthoic acids, naphthalene
sulfonates and 1-naphthyl N-methylcarbamate (carbaryl)], have
been considered as priority organic pollutants by the USEPA with
genotoxic, mutagenic, and/or carcinogenic eﬀects (Cerniglia,
1984). The release of such LMW-PAHs in the environment results
in the bioaccumulation of these compounds in the food chain at
various levels, thus aﬀecting the health of the ecosystem (Binkova
et al., 2000; Srogi, 2007; Quinn et al., 2009).
The sources and routes of exposure of PAHs to biota
primarily occur through transport and interaction among various
components of the ecosystem like soil, groundwater, surface
water, crops, and atmosphere (Arey and Atkinson, 2003).
The interplay and partitioning of various LMW-PAHs in the
ecosystem and its exposure routes to biota/human are depictedinFigure 1. Atmospheric contamination and transport (drifting)
through vehicular emission, industrial exhaust (coal gasiﬁcation,
combustion, and coke production), and its precipitation leads
to PAH deposition on surfaces. Industrial activities like
the production of synthetic textiles, dyes, and paint; wood
preservation; rubber processing; cement manufacturing activity;
pesticide production; and application in agriculture are the
main contributors of PAHs in terrestrial and aquatic systems
(Bamforth and Singleton, 2005; Wick et al., 2011). It has been
shown that soils of peri-urban to urban areas, near highway
sites, and larger cities are more exposed to PAHs because of
emissions from power plants, residential heating, airway/road
traﬃc burden, and construction activities (Suman et al., 2016).
Wang et al. (2008) have shown a maximum of 7,189 mg/kg
PAHs in soils close to the roads in comparison to open spaces
(2,404 mg/kg) in New Orleans, LA, United States. Similarly, as
high as 300 g/kg PAHs have been reported from areas near
coal gasiﬁcation sites in various cities of the United States
(Kanaly and Harayama, 2000; Bamforth and Singleton, 2005).
Soils from various cities of India like Delhi (Sharma et al.,
2008), Agra (Dubey et al., 2014), Mumbai (Kulkarni and
Venkataraman, 2000), and Visakhapatnam (Kulkarni et al.,
2014) were reported to contain higher concentrations of PAHs.
Aromatic compounds have a higher tendency to adsorb onto
soil particles, organic matter, and clay minerals, thus acting
as a major sink in the ecosystem (Srogi, 2007; Peng et al.,
2008). Atmospheric deposition (wet/dry deposition and vapors),
runoﬀ from urban sites, wastewater discharges, groundwater
recharge, etc. are the major contributors for PAHs into aqueous
ecosystems (Srogi, 2007). It has been estimated that around
80% of total PAHs in the marine ecosystem have originated
from atmospheric precipitation, deposition, and dumping of
waste (Motelay-Massei et al., 2006; Srogi, 2007). The higher
levels of PAHs in surface water or leachates from solid waste
disposal sites ultimately channel to groundwater, thus creating
more vulnerability to the community’s health, as groundwater
is consumed by over 70% of populations of Southern and
South-Eastern Asia (Duttagupta et al., 2019). A recent study by
Duttagupta et al. (2020) involving samples from river (32) and
groundwater (235) locations of West Bengal, India, has shown

that an estimated 53% of urban and 44% of rural residents (total
of 20 million residents) are potentially exposed to naphthalene
(4.9–10.6 mg/L) and its derivatives. Diﬀerential land-use pattern
and increased groundwater pumping/abstraction have been
suggested as main controlling factors for vertical transport
(advection) of LMW-PAHs in subsurface regimes. River basins
and subsurface sediments are found to be impacted by PAHs
due to agricultural runoﬀ and domestic and industrial wastewater
discharge as well as solid waste/garbage dumping. The loadings
are further enhanced through atmospheric precipitation. Higher
concentrations of PAHs and its alkyl derivatives (total of 51
types) have been reported from various rivers/river basins across
the globe like Fraser, Luanhe, Densu, Missouri, Anacostia, Ebro,
Delaware, etc. (Yunker et al., 2002; Motelay-Massei et al., 2006; Li
et al., 2010; Amoako et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2018). Naphthalene
and phenanthrene are found to be the most predominant
(detected in 70% of the samples) in the sediments of the Ganga
River basin (Duttagupta et al., 2019). It has been also observed
that chlorination of drinking water may lead to the formation
of more toxic oxygenated and chlorinated PAHs (Manoli and
Samara, 1999). Accumulation of PAHs into grains, fruits, and
vegetables occurs through uptake by plants from contaminated
soil, groundwater, and atmospheric deposition (Fismes et al.,
2002). Many aquatic biota like ﬁsh, mussels, shellﬁsh, and shrimp
are found to be contaminated with PAHs through ingestion of
contaminated food, marine water, and absorption in the tissues
and skin (Mackay and Fraser, 2000). Food cooking/processing
methods like grilling, barbecuing, smoking, frying, roasting,
drying, baking, and charbroiling also contribute a signiﬁcant
amount of PAHs into foods. This is highly dependent on the
choice of smoking material, phenolic/aromatic content, cooking
procedures, heater type, moisture content, oxygen availability,
and combustion temperature (Guillén et al., 2000; Gomes et al.,
2013). PAHs have also been detected in milk at varying levels
(0.75–2.1 mg/L) (Girelli et al., 2014). Accumulation of these PAHs
in food also depends on the physicochemical properties of food,
whereas its toxicity eﬀects are linked to the organism’s physiology,
metabolic activity, uptake, distribution, and partitioning in the
body (Menichini et al., 2011).
The toxicity and the hazardous impact of PAHs were known
a long time ago (Cerniglia, 1984). The LMW-PAHs (two to
three rings) can bind covalently to various macromolecules like
DNA, RNA, and proteins and exert carcinogenicity (Santarelli
et al., 2008). Due to their hydrophobic nature, they get
partitioned into the lipid membranes. In humans, cytochrome-
P450monooxygenase oxidizes PAHs to epoxides, some of which
are highly reactive (such as bay-region diol epoxides) and
responsible for the transformation of normal cells to malignant
ones (Marston et al., 2001). In addition, the PAH transformation
products like quinones, phenolics, epoxides, diols, etc. are
more toxic than the parent compounds. Several PAHs and
their metabolic intermediates have the ability to interfere with
hormones and various enzymes in metabolism leading to
adverse eﬀects on growth, the central nervous system, and the
reproductive and immune systems (Swetha and Phale, 2005;
Vamsee-Krishna et al., 2006; Oostingh et al., 2008). Short-term
exposure to LMW-PAHs has been reported to cause impairedlung function in asthmatic patients with thrombotic eﬀects and
increased risk of skin, lung, bladder, and gastrointestinal cancers
(Olsson et al., 2010; Diggs et al., 2011). Animal studies have also
shown adverse reproductive and developmental eﬀects from PAH
exposure and may further induce cataracts and cause kidney and
liver damage and jaundice. Various biotransformation products
of PAHs like diols, epoxides, quinones, and free radicals (cations)
have shown to form DNA adducts. The stable adducts have shown
to alter DNA replication machineries, while unstable adducts
depurinate DNA (mostly adenine, but sometimes guanine);
both generate errors leading to mutations (Schweigert et al.,
2001). In addition, quinones (benzo-/ubi-) can generate reactive
oxygen species (ROS) that confer lethal damage to DNA and
other macromolecules, thus aﬀecting function/viability of the
tissue (Ewa and Danuta, 2017). Long-term exposure to low
concentrations of pyrene, biphenyl, and naphthalene has been
reported to cause cancer in laboratory animals (Diggs et al., 2012).
Owing to their lethal and toxic eﬀects, the cleanup/removal of
these PAHs from the impacted/polluted sites is a priority.
Various physical and chemical methods to remove PAHs
from contaminated sites/environments have been employed.
Processes like incineration, dechlorination, UV oxidation,
ﬁxation, solvent extraction, etc. have several drawbacks like toxic
by-product formation, complex process, safety and regulatory
issues, ineﬃciency, and high cost. However, microbe-mediated
biodegradation, referred to as bioremediation, which involves the
application of microbe(s) either as a pure culture or as consortia,
is a promising alternative. This process is eco-friendly, non-
invasive, cost eﬀective, and sustainable as compared with physical
and chemical methods. Bioremediation can be carried out at the
impacted site (in situ) or in a specially prepared place (ex situ) and
hence considered as a sustainable cleanup alternative than the
conventional physical and chemical methods (Juhasz and Naidu,
2000; Andreoni and Gianfreda, 2007; Megharaj et al., 2011; Phale
et al., 2020; Sarkar et al., 2020).
From the ecological and environmental sustainability
viewpoint, understanding the microbial metabolic steps involved
in the degradation of aromatic pollutants is of the highest
scientiﬁc and economic value. It has been estimated that a net
2.11018g carbon (C) has been preserved in the form of
sediment rocks and organic compounds, viz. oil, natural gas,
and coal (fossil fuels), signiﬁcantly contributing to the global C
cycle. However, rapid industrialization, fossil fuel exploitation,
and human activities are exploring such lithospheric carbon pool
and adding5.51015g of organic carbon (in the form of
pollutants) to the atmosphere each year (Gonzalez-Gaya et al.,
2019). The majority of this organic carbon is contributed to the
terrestrial and marine ecosystems through deposition, transport,
and runoﬀ. Further, fossil fuel-derived emerging synthetic
contaminants, i.e., plastics, plasticizers, and plastic stabilizers
(phthalates, its isomers), are predominantly contaminating
marine, soil, and water ecosystems and its biota critically, thus
contributing to a global climate risk. A range of polyethylene
terephthalate (PET)-derived micro- and nano-plastics, plastic
debris, and their toxic monomeric products have been assembled
together in the Paciﬁc region in between North America and
South-East Asia, forming “great Paciﬁc garbage patch” leading

Mohapatra and Phale Microbial Degradation of Naphthalene and Substituted Naphthalenes
to the destruction of marine ﬂora and fauna (Newell et al.,
2020). Scientiﬁc expeditions have proved the non-feasibility
of removing such pollutants/garbage by any physicochemical
means. In this context, microbes with oxidative metabolism
of pollutants to CO 2, chemical energy, and other non-toxic
by-products, which ultimately get inﬂux to other nutrient cycling
processes (H, O, N, S, P , Fe, etc.), are most beneﬁcial. Thus,
understanding the microbial ecophysiology of aromatic pollutant
mineralization and its ecological controls is critical for estimating
microbial C cycling, net C balance, and future climate risks.
Considering as high priority the removal of such compounds
from the environment, various eco-industries focusing on
cleanup technologies are developed. Alternatively, valorization of
industrial waste/waste chemicals (i.e., waste-to-wealth approach)
accumulating in the ecosystem is recognized to be one of the
pillars of the circular economy and sustainable development goal
(Close et al., 2012). So, for eﬃcient removal and bioremediation
of such aromatic pollutants, it is important to understand the
metabolic, enzymatic, and genetic aspects of these potential
degrading candidates.
NAPHTHALENE AND SUBSTITUTED
NAPHTHALENES AS MODEL
COMPOUNDS
Among several aromatic pollutants, we intended to focus
on low molecular weight PAHs like naphthalene and
substituted naphthalenes. These compounds are found to
be the main components of petroleum-derived fuels, textile
dyes, consumer products, pesticides (mothballs and insect
repellents), plasticizers, and tanning agents, hence ubiquitously
present in many ecosystems (Preuss et al., 2003). Recent reports
have highlighted the accumulation of higher concentrations of
naphthalene in aquifer sediment, groundwater and subsurface
soil, vadose zone, and river beds, signifying its bioaccumulation
in the environment (Duttagupta et al., 2019, 2020). The
physicochemical properties, applications, and health eﬀects of
naphthalene and naphthalene-based derivatives are summarized
inTable 2. Compared with other higher molecular weight
PAHs, naphthalene and its derivatives are often used as model
substrates to study PAH metabolism, genetics, and metabolic
diversity as they are less hydrophobic, more soluble in water, and
abundant in the ecosystem. A large number of microbes have the
ability to metabolize them with comprehensive information on
metabolic pathways, enzymes, and regulatory features (Mallick
et al., 2011; Phale et al., 2019, 2020). In addition, because of
higher abundance and bioavailability, these compounds are
designated as prototypic (signature) compounds to assess
the pollution in the environment. The USEPA estimated an
average of 5.19 mg naphthalene/m3derived primarily from the
incomplete combustion of fuels, 0.3–4 mg from cigarette smoke,
7.8–46 mg from sidestream smoke, and 100- to 10,000-fold
higher exposure through creosote and mothball manufacturing
(Preuss et al., 2003). Particularly, naphthalene is found to
have species-, regional-, and sex-selective respiratory toxicity
and carcinogenic eﬀects. Based on evidences from animalstudies, the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) has classiﬁed naphthalene to be a “likely human
carcinogen” (group 2B)1. Exposure to substituted naphthalenes is
predominantly through inhalation or parenteral administration
(oral consumption) leading to damage of lung tissues with
increased incidences of pulmonary tumors in rats and mice
(National Toxicology Program2). Nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, headache, confusion, profuse sweating, fever,
tachycardia, etc. are the consequences of acute exposure. On
the other hand, carbaryl (1-naphthyl N-methylcarbamate),
a broad-spectrum carbamate insecticide, has been reported
to be toxic to aquatic invertebrates, amphibians, bees, and
humans and has been shown to inhibit acetylcholine esterase
leading to paralysis (Smulders et al., 2003; Bulen and Distel,
2011). Thus, it is imperative to understand the microbial
degradation mechanisms, genetic regulations, enzymes, and
cellular response to strategize its bioremediation from a
contaminated environment.
MICROBIAL DEGRADATION OF
NAPHTHALENE AND SUBSTITUTED
NAPHTHALENES
Taxonomic Diversity of Degrading
Microbes
In contaminated niches, hydrophobic and lipophilic aromatic
pollutants exert varied cellular eﬀects on environmental
microbiome (communities), e.g., altering the membrane
ﬂuidity, permeabilization of membranes, swelling of lipid
bilayers, disruption in energy transduction (electron transport
chain/proton motive force), and the activity of membrane-
associated proteins (Sikkema et al., 1995). Additionally, some
soluble intermediates like catechols and quinones produce ROS
and form adducts with DNA and proteins (Penning et al., 1999).
Thus, the abundance of such compounds in the ecosystem
acts as a selection pressure on the microbial community
to evolve as an eﬃcient degrader at various physiological
levels such as uptake/transport, intracellular transformation,
assimilation/utilization, and compartmentalization.
The Ribosomal Database Project-II (RDP-II) search
shows that a total of 926 bacteria have been isolated from
the environment contaminated with naphthalene or its
derivatives or enrichment cultures. Proteobacteria members
represented the maximum ( n= 755), followed by Firmicutes (52),
Bacteroidetes (43), Actinobacteria (39), Tenericutes (10), and
unclassiﬁed bacteria (8) (Figure 2). Members of g-proteobacteria
(Pseudomonadales and Xanthomonadales) are predominantly
(54%) reported among all Gram-negative, high G CC content
groups, whereas Clostridiales and Bacillales (30%) are among the
Gram-positive low G CC content groups. Pseudomonas (a total
of 338 spp., being the highest) are reported for the degradation of
naphthalene and its methyl derivatives from many contaminated

indicated the probable degradation capacity of uncultivable
Legionella and Clostridium members, indicating the need of
cultivating these bacteria to understand novel pathways and
metabolic diversity.
Metabolic Pathways for Complete
Utilization/Mineralization
Naphthalene
Among various reported microbes for the degradation of
aromatics, the majority of them have the ability to degrade
naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy. The
sequence of events involved in naphthalene metabolism has
been reported from Pseudomonas putida (strains: NCIB 9816-4,
G7, AK-5, PMD-1, and CSV86), Pseudomonas stutzeri AN10,
Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens PC20, and other spp. (ND6 and AS1)
(Mahajan et al., 1994; Resnick et al., 1996; Annweiler et al.,
2000; Basu et al., 2003; Dennis and Zylstra, 2004; Sota et al.,
2006; Izmalkova et al., 2013). The metabolism is initiated by a
multicomponent dioxygenase enzyme [naphthalene dioxygenase
(NDO), ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase] which catalyzes the
oxidation of one of the aromatic rings of naphthalene using
molecular oxygen as another substrate to convert naphthalenetocis-naphthalene dihydrodiol (Figure 3). cis-Dihydrodiol is
converted to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene by dehydrogenase.
Ring-cleaving dioxygenase, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene
dioxygenase (12DHNDO), converts 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene
to 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylic acid. An enzymatic
cis–trans isomerization forms trans-o-hydroxybenzylidene
pyruvate, which gets cleaved by a hydratase-aldolase to
salicylaldehyde and pyruvate. The organic acid pyruvate is
the ﬁrst C3 compound derived from naphthalene carbon
skeleton and channelized to central carbon pathway. Further,
NADC-dependent salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase converts
salicylaldehyde to salicylate. Metabolism up to this step
is referred to as the “upper pathway” for naphthalene
degradation. This route is very common in most of the
naphthalene degraders. However, there are few exceptions; for
example, in Bacillus thermoleovorans Hamburg 2, naphthalene
degradation is initiated by naphthalene 2,3-dioxygenase to yield
2,3-dihydroxy-naphthalene (Annweiler et al., 2000).
Depending on the organism and its genetic makeup, the
generated salicylate is further metabolized either viathe catechol
route using salicylate 1-hydroxylase (S1H) or the gentisate
route employing salicylate 5-hydroxyalse (S5H) (Figure 3). As
salicylate is designated to be a major intermediate of naphthalene
metabolism (upper pathway), the steps from salicylate to TCA
intermediates often termed as lower pathway and genes are
organized as a single operon. It is often seen that both the upper
pathway (nah) operon and lower pathway (sal operon) genes

are regulated through a common regulator; for example, NahR
and salicylate act as an inducer for both operons to metabolize
naphthalene completely (Phale et al., 2019, 2020).
Further, catechol is ring-cleaved through the meta route
by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23DO) to 2-hydroxymuconic
semialdehyde (Yen et al., 1988), which is further hydrolyzed
by 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase to yield 2-
hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate. Subsequent actions of hydratase
(2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase) and aldolase (4-hydroxy-2-
oxovalerate aldolase) convert 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate intopyruvic acid and acetaldehyde which are then funneled
into the central carbon pathway (Figure 3). Alternatively,
catechol is ring-cleaved via the ortho route by catechol 1,2-

Mohapatra and Phale Microbial Degradation of Naphthalene and Substituted Naphthalenes
produce maleylpyruvate. This product can directly hydrolyze to
pyruvate and malate or may undergo into isomerization to yield
fumarylpyruvate which is hydrolyzed to pyruvate and fumarate
(Larkin and Day, 1986). At the biochemical and genetic levels,
alternative pathway selection has been noticed in Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria (Morawski et al., 1997; Whyte et al.,
1997). Gram-negative members (Pseudomonas) prefer salicylate
for decarboxylation by salicylate 1-hydroxylase to yield catechol,
where salicylate acts as an inducer for naphthalene metabolism
(Gibson and Subramanian, 1984). On the other hand, in
Gram-positive bacteria (Rhodococcus), salicylate 5-hydroxylase is
employed to convert salicylate to gentisate, where salicylate has
no induction eﬀects on the transcription of naphthalene genes
(Grund et al., 1992) (Figure 3).
Methylnaphthalenes
Organisms like P. putida CSV86, Marinobacter sp. NCE312,
Neptunomonas naphthovorans, Sphingomonas paucimobilis 2322,
Vibrio cyclotrophicus, P. ﬂuorescens LP6a, Pseudomonas spp., and
Mycobacterium have been reported to degrade mono- or di-
methylnaphthalenes (Dean-Raymond and Bartha, 1975; Cane
and Williams, 1982; Mahajan et al., 1994; Dutta et al., 1998;
Hedlund et al., 1999). Among these, the degradation pathway
for 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene from P. putida CSV86 has been
well elucidated at the biochemical and enzymatic levels (Mahajan
et al., 1994). 1-Methylnaphthalene is metabolized by two routes,
ﬁrstly by aromatic ring-hydroxylation (of the unsubstituted ring
of methylnaphthalene) to yield cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydro-8-
methylnaphthalene, which is further oxidized to methylsalicylate
and methylcatechol, which upon ring-cleavage channeled to the
central carbon pathway (Figure 3). This pathway is referred to
as the “carbon source pathway.” In the second, “detoxiﬁcation
pathway, ” the methyl group is hydroxylated, probably by NDO,
to form 1-hydroxy methylnaphthalene which is further oxidized
to 1-naphthoic acid and excreted into the medium as a dead-end
product. It has been shown that strain CSV86 failed to grow on
1- and 2-naphthoic acid as the sole source of carbon and energy,
conﬁrming the detoxiﬁcation pathway (Mahajan et al., 1994;
Basu et al., 2003). In case of 2-methylnaphthalene, the methyl
group is hydroxylated by hydroxylase, resulting in the formation
of 2-hydroxymethyl naphthalene. Further, it undergoes ring-
hydroxylation of unsubstituted ring to yield dihydrodiol, which
gets oxidized by a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions to form 4-
hydroxymethyl catechol and follows the meta ring-cleavage route
to enter the central carbon pathway. Similarly, S. paucimobilis
2322 has been reported to hydroxylate 2-methyl naphthalene by
employing NDO, and further oxidation yields methylsalicylate
and methylcatechol (Dutta et al., 1998).
Naphthoic Acid
Naphthoic acids (substituted/unsubstituted) are formed
as detoxiﬁcation/biotransformation by-products during
degradation of methylnaphthalenes, phenanthrene, and
anthracene and are excreted into the spent medium. The soil
isolate Stenotrophomonas maltophilia CSV89 has been reported
to metabolize 1-naphthoic acid as a carbon source (Phale et al.,
1995). The metabolism is initiated by double hydroxylation ofthe aromatic ring to yield 1,2-dihydroxy-8-carboxynaphthalene.
The resultant diol gets oxidized via2-hydroxy-3-carboxybenzal
pyruvate, 3-formylsalicylate, 2-hydroxyisophthalate, and
salicylate to catechol and enters viathemeta ring-cleavage route
to the central carbon pathway (Figure 3).
1-Naphthyl N-methylcarbamate (Carbaryl)
Carbaryl is a naphthalene-based carbamate pesticide. With the
onset of the Green Revolution in the 1970s in India, the use
of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has increased the PAH
load through non-point source agricultural outﬂow (Pingali,
2012; Duttagupta et al., 2020). An estimated 55% (85,722,000
hectares) of total cultivated farmland are under the use of
chemical pesticides. In the last 5 years (2015–2020, till date),
an average of 55,000–60,000 metric tons of pesticides/year are
used in the Indian agricultural ﬁeld (Department of Agriculture,
cooperation, farmers welfare, Govt. of India3, August 2020). The
crops grown over the northern and middle Gangetic plain areas
(states with the highest population and density) are pervasively
using pesticides, among which insecticides are predominant.
Carbaryl (1-naphthyl N-methylcarbamate) is a wide-spectrum,
moderate to very toxic carbamate insecticide with an average use
of 100–110 metric tons in Indian agriculture. It is generally sold
under the trade name Sevin for controlling insects (aphids, ﬁre
ants, ﬂeas, ticks, spiders, and many other outdoor pests) infesting
various crops (corn, soybean, cotton, fruits, and vegetables).
Few microbes like Pseudomonas spp. (NCIB 12042, 12043,
C4, C5, C6, C7, P. putida XWY-1), Rhodococcus sp. (NCIB
12038), Sphingobium qiguonii (CF06), Burkholderia sp. (C3),
Micrococcus, and Arthrobacter sp. (RC100) are reported to
degrade carbaryl (Larkin and Day, 1986; Chapalamadugu and
Chaudhry, 1991; Hayatsu et al., 1999; Swetha and Phale, 2005;
Trivedi et al., 2017). The carbaryl degradation pathway is studied
in detail at the biochemical and enzymatic as well as at the genetic
level from the soil isolates Pseudomonas sp. strains C4, C5, and
C6 (Swetha and Phale, 2005; Trivedi et al., 2016) (Figure 3).
The metabolic pathway starts with the hydrolysis of ester bond
by carbaryl hydrolase (CH) to form 1-naphthol, methylamine,
and CO 2. The subsequent action of 1-naphthol hydroxylase (1-
NH) converts 1-naphthol to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, which is
further metabolized to the central carbon pathway viasalicylic
acid and gentisic acid. Few carbaryl degraders were also reported
to metabolize it through salicylic acid viathe catechol ortho
ring-cleavage route (Larkin and Day, 1986; Chapalamadugu and
Chaudhry, 1991). It is interesting to note that, in naphthalene
degraders, salicylic acid is predominantly metabolized through
catechol, whereas Carbaryl degraders prefer the gentisic acid
route for salicylate metabolism.
Naphthalene Sulfonates
Naphthalene sulfonic/disulfonic acids and
naphthylaminesulfonic acid derivatives are used as intermediates
in the production of azo dyes, wetting agents, dispersants, etc.
Although the compounds are less toxic to humans, cytotoxicity
assessment has shown its lethal eﬀects on ﬁsh, water ﬂeas

Mohapatra and Phale Microbial Degradation of Naphthalene and Substituted Naphthalenes
(Daphnia), and water algae (Greim et al., 1994). Members of
Pseudomonas spp. (strains A3, C22) have been reported to initiate
metabolism through double hydroxylation of the aromatic ring
bearing sulfonate group to yield dihydro diol, which is further
converted to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene by spontaneous
elimination of the sulﬁte group (Brilon et al., 1981). The
generated 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene is catabolized through the
classical naphthalene pathway either viathe catechol or gentisate
route (Figure 4). It has also been demonstrated that amino- and
hydroxy-naphthalene sulfonic acids are completely degraded
by mixed bacterial consortium harboring complementary
catabolic pathways (Nortemann et al., 1986). One member of
this community was shown to desulfonate amino- or hydroxy-
naphthalene sulfonic acids by 1,2-dioxygenation, and amino-
or hydroxysalicylates were excreted as dead-end metabolites
into the medium, which are subsequently assimilated by other
members of the consortium. Naphthalene disulfonic acids, being
comparatively more polar but resistant for biodegradation,
are metabolized by diﬀerent pathways. The ﬁrst desulfonation
occurs by regioselective dihydroxylation of the aromatic ring
with the sulfonate group, while the second one occurs during
hydroxylation of 5-sulfosalicylic acid by salicylate 5-hydroxylase
to generate gentisic acid, which enters the central carbon pathway
(Brilon et al., 1981) (Figure 4). The enzymes responsible for
naphthalene degradation are also responsible for naphthalene
sulfonate metabolism (Brilon et al., 1981; Keck et al., 2006).
Enzymes
The LMW-PAHs are reducing, hydrophobic, and sparingly
soluble, thus resistant to natural attenuation/degradation.
However, aerobic microorganisms have the ability to oxidize
them by incorporating molecular oxygen (O 2). These enzymes
mainly belong to oxido-reductase class and perform various
reactions like aromatic ring-hydroxylation (mono- or di-),
dehydrogenation, and aromatic ring-cleavage. These reactions
yield products with increased oxidation status and are more
susceptible for further metabolism to the central carbon pathway
(Phale et al., 2020). The degradation pathway enzymes are
reported to be inducible. The activities of these enzymes were
found to be very low or negligible when cells are grown on
a simple carbon source like glucose or organic acids. Various
enzymes (oxygenase, hydrolase, dehydrogenase, oxidase, etc.)
involved in the metabolism of naphthalene and its derivatives are
summarized in Table 3.
Radio-isotopic studies (18O2) have demonstrated that
incorporation of molecular O 2by oxygenases to the aromatic
ring is the most crucial step in activating the compound for
further biodegradation (Hayaishi et al., 1955; Mason et al., 1955).
Incorporation of a single oxygen atom (O) from the molecular
oxygen (O 2) into the substrate is initiated by either internal
or external monooxygenase (also referred to as hydroxylase).
The other oxygen atom is reduced to water. External mono-
oxygenases use NADH or NADPH to reduce ﬂavin, while in
internal mono-oxygenases, ﬂavin is reduced by the substrate.
The position of hydroxylation results in the diversity of
product formation. For example, salicylate 1-hydroxylase
hydroxylates salicylate at C1 position to form catechol. Onthe other hand, multicomponent salicylate 5-hydroxylase
(with reductase, ferredoxin, and oxygenase subunit) performs
hydroxylation at the C5 position of salicylate to yield gentisate
(Y amamoto et al., 1965).
Dioxygenases incorporate both atoms of O 2into the
substrate. Based on the product formed, they are grouped
either as ring-hydroxylating or ring-cleaving dioxygenase. The
ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase converts aromatic substrate
to yield cis-dihydrodiols (like naphthalene) and is found
to be prevalent in bacteria. To date, ring-hydroxylating
dioxygenase-containing organisms have been shown to grow
on a range of aromatic carbon sources, and these enzymes
have been classiﬁed as NDO (for naphthalene), toluene
dioxygenase (TDO for toluene), and biphenyl dioxygenase
(BPDO for biphenyl). Both NDO and BPDO are capable of
catalyzing dioxygenation and side-chain hydroxylation of various
PAHs (toluene, nitrotoluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene,
biphenyl, ﬂuorene, indole, methylnaphthalene, naphthalene
sulfonates, phenanthrene, anthracene, acetophenones, etc.)
(Boyd and Sheldrake, 1998; Phale et al., 2020). The NDO
is a multicomponent system that includes oxido-reductase, a
ferredoxin, and an oxygenase component containing the active
site (Gibson and Subramanian, 1984; Resnick et al., 1996). The
catalytic unit of the NDO is composed of large and small subunits
(aandb), respectively, arranged in a3b3 conﬁguration. NDO
is a member of a large family of oxygenases with asubunits
containing a Rieske [2Fe-2S] center and mononuclear non-
heme iron, which determines the substrate speciﬁcity of NDO
(Parales et al., 1998). Generally, two electrons from the reduced
pyridine nucleotide are transferred viareductase, ferredoxin, and
Rieske center to Fe(II) ion at the active site during a catalytic
cycle. The reducing equivalents allow the activation of molecular
oxygen, which is a prerequisite to dihydroxylation of the substrate
(Ferraro et al., 2005). So far, few NDOs have been puriﬁed and
extensively characterized from diﬀerent strains of bacteria, and
the genetic control of the pathways involved in naphthalene
degradation has been studied in detail (Resnick et al., 1996;
Parales et al., 1998; Karlsson et al., 2003). The ring-cleaving
dioxygenases (intradiol or ortho ring-cleavage and extradiol or
meta ring-cleavage) act on hydroxylated aromatic compounds.
For example, the ortho ring-cleaving dioxygenase is catechol
1,2-dioxygenase, while the meta ring-cleaving is catechol 2,3-
dioxygenase (Kojima et al., 1961; Nozaki et al., 1968). Besides
various oxygenases, various dehydrogenases are responsible
for dehydrogenation of aromatic dihydrodiols, alcohols, and
aldehydes and use NADC/NADPCas an electron acceptor and
are one of the important enzymes involved in metabolism
(Gibson and Subramanian, 1984; Shaw and Harayama, 1990;
Phale et al., 2020).
Enzymes like hydrolases (esterases, amidases) are the second
important classes of enzymes that utilize water to cleave the
covalent bond and display a broad substrate speciﬁcity. Carbaryl
hydrolase and other hydrolases are proposed to be periplasmic
in Gram-negative members as an integral (transmembrane)
component (Kamini et al., 2018). Carbaryl possesses an amide
as well as an ester linkage; hence, hydrolysis can be catalyzed
either by esterase or amidase to yield 1-naphthol. The CH

from Rhizobium sp. strain AC10023 and Arthrobacter sp.
strain RC100 was reported to act as esterase and amidase,
respectively. CH from Arthrobacter sp. RC100 has shown
hydrolysis of four N-methylcarbamate insecticides, e.g., Carbaryl,
xylylcarb, metolcarb, and XMC (Hayatsu et al., 2001). CH from
Pseudomonas sp. C5pp was reported to act on Carbaryl (100%
activity) and 1-naphthylacetate (36%) but not on 1-naphthalene
acetamide, suggesting it to be an esterase (Trivedi et al., 2016).
Genetic Organization and Regulatory
Features
Biochemical studies, enzyme regulation pattern, and genetic
analyses have shown that the naphthalene degradation genes
are arranged as two inducible regulatory units, “operons”: nah
(“upper pathway, ” naphthalene to salicylate) and sal(“lower
pathway, ” salicylate to central carbon pathway via catechol).
Salicylic acid and its analogs act as inducers (Shamsuzzaman
and Barnsley, 1974). The operons are suppressed in the presence
of glucose or organic acids. The complete genetic organization
of naphthalene degradation (as operons) is summarized in
Figure 5. Several nomenclatural variations/forms of nah genes
(ndo/pah/dox ) are described and found to share high sequence
homology (90%) in all Pseudomonas spp. (Abbasian et al., 2016).
The naphthalene “upper pathway” genes are often arranged
asen bloc in consensus order as shown in Figure 5A. An
additional gene nahQ has also been reported to be involved
in naphthalene metabolism and is often found in betweennahC and nahE, but its actual function is yet to be examined.
Similarly, the nahY gene responsible for naphthalene-responsive
chemotaxis is found to be present at the distal end of the
nah operon in some of the members. In Ralstonia sp. U2,
genes encoding glutathione-S-transferase (gsh) were found to
be present in between nahAa and nahAb without aﬀecting
naphthalene utilization trait (Zylstra et al., 1997).
The “lower pathway” (sal operon) often consists of
nahGTHINLMOKJ and converts salicylate to pyruvate and
acetaldehyde via the catechol meta ring-cleavage pathway.
Gene nahG (encoding salicylate hydroxylase) was found to be
conserved at the proximal end of the operon (Figure 5B). As
compared with other strains of naphthalene degradation, in
P. putida CSV86, the nah and saloperons are tandem and in
close proximity (7.5 kb). In some Gram-negative members
like Ralstonia sp. U2, Polaromonas naphthalenivorans CJ2, and
P.putida AK5, naphthalene is metabolized to central carbon
metabolites via the gentisate route (as sgp/nag operon). The
genetic cassette is often present as nagAaGHAbAcAdBFCQEDJI
with nagR (encoding LysR type regulator) located at the
upstream end (Figure 5C).
Carbaryl is metabolized to the central carbon cycle via1-
naphthol, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, salicylate, and gentisate
(Figure 3). Based on genetic and metabolic studies, the pathway
has been proposed to be organized into “upper” (carbaryl
to salicylate), “middle” (salicylate to gentisate), and “lower”
pathways (gentisate to central carbon pathway intermediates)

(Singh et al., 2013). Genomic analysis of C5pp (as supercontig-
A, 76.3 kb) has shown that genes mcbACBDEF are involved
in converting Carbaryl to salicylate, followed by mcbIJKL for
salicylate to gentisate, and mcbOQP for gentisate to central
carbon intermediates (as fumarate and pyruvate, Trivedi et al.,
2016) (Figure 6).
Enzymes involved in the degradation of aromatics including
naphthalene and salicylate are reported to be inducible by the
respective compound and suppressed by simple carbon source
like glucose or organic acids (Shingler, 2003; Phale et al.,
2019, 2020). Among various pathways for the metabolism of
naphthalene and its derivatives, regulatory features are studied
to some extent for naphthalene and carbaryl. In the case
of naphthalene, both “upper” and “lower” pathway genes are
regulated through a NahR, which is a LysR-type trans-acting
positive regulator. It is required for the induction of nah
genes by salicylate and their subsequent high-level expression
(Yen and Gunsalus, 1982). It has been also found that the
integration host factor (IHF) along with XylR (sigma-54-
dependent transcriptional regulator) are also important for
transcription activation of genes in naphthalene metabolism
(Ramos et al., 1997). The enzymes of the catechol meta ring-
cleavage route, i.e., catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and others, were
found to be induced in the presence of naphthalene and/or
salicylate (Basu et al., 2006). The catechol ortho ring-cleavage
route enzymes, i.e., catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and others, were
found to be induced by benzoate as well as by cis,cis-muconate
(Parsek et al., 1994; Tover et al., 2001).
In strain C5pp, ﬁve genes, i.e., mcbG, mcbH, mcbN, mcbR,
and mcbS, code for regulators belonging to the LysR/TetR
family transcriptional regulator for Carbaryl degradation. The
closest homolog of mcbG was found to be LysR-type PhnS
(58% amino acid identity) regulator involved in phenanthrene
metabolism in Burkholderia sp. strain RP00725 (Trivedi et al.,
2016). Gene mcbH was found to be a part of the middle pathway
(salicylate to gentisate) and belongs to the NagR/DntR/NahR-
type LysR transcriptional regulators from Pseudomonas sp.
and Burkholderia sp. Members of this family are reported to
recognize salicylate as the speciﬁc eﬀector molecule to induce the
degradation genes. On the other hand, three genes mcbN, mcbR,
and mcbS belonging to LysR- and TetR-type transcriptional
regulators were identiﬁed in the lower pathway (gentisate to
central carbon pathway metabolites).
Genetic Diversity
In prokaryotes, the horizontal gene transfer process (acquisition,
exchange, or transmission) through plasmids, transposons,
prophages, genomic islands, and integrative conjugative elements
(ICEs) is the major reason for the plasticity in bacterial genomes
leading to gain or loss of a speciﬁc function/property. It provides
fast-forward adaptation to various environments, conferring
potential adaptive metabolic beneﬁts, viz. aromatic compound
degradation, to the bacterial host. The metabolic variations
are generally made through the ﬁne-tuning of degradative
operons, its regulation, and speciﬁcity of the enzymes, aiding
in the degradation of a wider range of aromatics (Nojiri
et al., 2004; Phale et al., 2019, 2020). The genetic cassettefor naphthalene degradation has been found to be located
on various mobile elements like plasmids (conjugative and
non-conjugative), transposons, genome, ICE, and combinations
of diﬀerent bacterial members (Figure 5 ). In P. putida G7,
plasmid NAH7 has nah and saloperons transcribed in the
same direction and is part of a defective transposon that
requires Tn4653 transposase for its mobilization (Sota et al.,
2006). In P. putida strain NCIB9816-4, genes were found to
be present on a conjugative plasmid pDTG1 as two operons
(15 kb apart) which are transcribed in opposite direction
(Dennis and Zylstra, 2004). In P. putida strain AK5, a non-
conjugative plasmid pAK5 codes for enzymes responsible for the
degradation of naphthalene viathe gentisate pathway (Izmalkova
et al., 2013). In P. putida strain PMD-1, the nah operon was
found to be located on the chromosome, while the saloperon
was present on conjugative plasmid pMWD-1 (Zuniga et al.,
1981). However, in P. stutzeri AN10, all naphthalene degradation
genes (nah and saloperons) were found to be located on
the chromosome and hypothesized to be recruited through
transposition, recombination, and rearrangement events (Bosch
et al., 2000). In P. putida CSV86, nah and saloperons are
located on the genome as ICE (ICE CSV 86). The structure is
found to be guarded by tRNA Glyfollowed by direct repeats
denoting sites for recombination/attachment (att Rand att L) at
both ends and phage-like integrase, hence structurally similar to
the ICEclc element (ICEclc B13 of Pseudomonas knackmusii for
chlorocatechol degradation). It has been reported that the genes
on the ICE are transferrable through conjugation at a very low
(10 8) frequency, thus disseminating degradation traits to the
recipient (Basu and Phale, 2008; Phale et al., 2019).
Genes responsible for Carbaryl degradation are mostly located
on plasmids. Arthrobacter sp. RC100 harbors three plasmids
(pRC1, pRC2, and pRC300) of which two conjugative plasmids,
pRC1 and pRC2, encode enzymes for the conversion of carbaryl
to gentisic acid. On the other hand, enzymes involved in the
conversion of gentisic acid to central carbon metabolites are
located on the chromosome (Hayatsu et al., 1999). A Rhizobium
sp. strain AC100, which transforms carbaryl to 1-naphthol,
harbors a plasmid pAC200 carrying the gene cehA encoding
CH as part of the Tnceh transposon ﬂanked by insertion
element-like sequence (ist A and istB) (Hashimoto et al., 2002).
InSphingomonas sp. strain CF06, Carbaryl degradation genes
were proposed to present on ﬁve plasmids: pCF01, pCF02,
pCF03, pCF04, and pCF05 with high inter-DNA homology,
indicating gene duplication events (Feng et al., 1997). In one
of the Carbaryl-degrading consortia of two Pseudomonas spp.,
the strain 50581 harbors a conjugative plasmid, pCD1 (50 kb),
which encodes the mcd gene for Carbaryl hydrolase, while the
chromosomal counterpart in 50552 encodes enzymes for 1-
naphthol degradation (Chapalamadugu and Chaudhry, 1991).
The mcd gene for carbofuran hydrolase is found to be located on
a 100-kb plasmid (pPDL11) in Achromobacter sp. strain WM111.
This gene was shown to be present on various plasmids (100,
105, 115, or 124 kb) in many bacteria from geographically distant
areas (Parekh et al., 1995). In Pseudomonas sp. C5pp, all genes
responsible for Carbaryl degradation were found to be located
on the genome spanning 76.3 kb sequence (Trivedi et al., 2016).

Mohapatra and Phale Microbial Degradation of Naphthalene and Substituted Naphthalenes
FIGURE 6 | The genetic organization involved in the degradation of Carbaryl by Pseudomonas sp. C5pp.
The genome (6.15 Mb) analysis revealed the presence of 42
MGEs and 36 GEIs, out of which 17 MGEs were located in
supercontig-A (76.3 kb) with mean skewing of G CC content
(54–60 mol%), indicating the possible occurrence of HGT events
(Trivedi et al., 2016). P. putida XWY-1 has shown a similar gene
arrangement for Carbaryl degradation, but the genes are located
on the plasmid (Zhu et al., 2019).
Microbial Response(s) for Assisting
Efﬁcient Degradation
Besides metabolic eﬃciency at the biochemical and
genomic levels, microbes do show additional properties or
responses like chemotaxis, cell surface alteration properties,
compartmentalization, preferential utilization, biosurfactant
production, etc. which help them to metabolize these
aromatic pollutants from the contaminated niche more
eﬃciently (Figure 7).
Chemotaxis
Chemotactic responses have been ascribed to enhance the
degradation of organic pollutants in heterogeneous contaminated
ecosystems. Pedit et al. (2002) demonstrated that chemotaxis
to naphthalene by P. putida G7 has increased the rate of
naphthalene degradation in an aqueous system. The wild-
type strain G7 degraded naphthalene at a much faster rate
than chemotaxis-deﬁcient mutant strains. The protein NahY
(538 amino acids with a membrane topology) was found to
be co-transcribed with meta-cleavage pathway genes from the
NAH7 plasmid and resembled a chemotaxis transducer protein,
which appears to function as a chemoreceptor for naphthalene
degradation (Grimm and Harwood, 1997). Another study by
Hanzel et al. (2011) showed the chemotactic response of
P. putida to vapor-phase naphthalene, where gas-phase diﬀusion
resulted in steady naphthalene ﬂux to the cells controlling the
chemotactic response of cells. Researchers have taken advantage
of such chemotactic behavior to engineer microbes to enhance
the degradation rate. It has been shown that chemosensory
pathways also regulate other cellular functions like cell division,
cell cycle regulation, and bioﬁlm formation, thus contribute
in controlling degradation rate. However, the exploration of
such trait (chemotaxis) for eﬀective degradation is impeded
by certain bottlenecks. The major obstacles are as follows: (a)
the same compound/ligand recognition by diﬀerent paralogousreceptors; (b) the presence of other receptors, i.e., energy
taxis; (c) the signiﬁcant sequence divergence in the sensor
domain of the same receptor family; and (d) the lack of
information on major bacterial sensor proteins (Ortega et al.,
2017; Martin-Mora et al., 2018). Sometimes, biodegradation of
aromatics results in several metabolites/intermediates that might
be chemotactic to one population but repellent to others and,
hence, creates further complexity. For the identiﬁcation of ligand
(aromatic)–chemoreceptor interactions, hybrid sensor proteins
(PcaY , McfR, and NahY) were constructed by fusing sensor
domains and signaling domains of P. putida and Escherichia coli
targeting receptors for aromatic acids, TCA intermediates, and
naphthalene (Luu et al., 2019).
Cell Surface/Membrane Fluidity
Crucial changes in the structure and integrity of the bacterial
membrane were observed in microbes in response to naphthalene
and other PAHs. Naphthalene is found to interact through
hydrophobic interaction and disturbs the acyl chain interaction,
thus increasing the swelling of the membrane and ﬂuidity
(Sikkema et al., 1995). To counter the deleterious eﬀect, bacteria
regulates membrane ﬂuidity by changing the proportion and
composition of fatty acid between iso/ante-iso branched chain
fatty acids and isomerization of cisunsaturated fatty acids to
the corresponding trans isomers (Heipieper and de Bont, 1994).
InP. stutzeri when grown under naphthalene amendments,
the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids was found to
increase from 1.1 to 2.1, while in Pseudomonas sp. JS150, it
increased from 7.5 to 12.0 (Mrozik et al., 2004). When grown
on naphthalene, Achromobacter sp. KAs 3–5 cells showed cellular
aggregation around naphthalene crystals with decreased cell
surface charge (from  22.5 to 2.5 mV) with cytoplasmic
condensation and vacuolation, suggesting changes in the cell
structure and cell surface properties (Mohapatra et al., 2019).
Although cellular/surface changes are directly linked to better
uptake of the aromatic pollutants, no concurrent bioengineering
strategies have been thoroughly optimized. The manipulation of
cell shapes has been rarely exploited to optimize bioprocesses
(Volke and Nikel, 2018). Gene deletions aﬀecting the cell division
induce morphological changes in cells. Gene deletions aﬀecting
cell division induce morphological changes in cells. In Bacillus
subtilis, the cell septation protein SepF has shown to be involved
in the septum formation and is required for a later step in cell
division but does not represent an essential gene. Deletion of

genes encoding peptidoglycan hydrolases in B. subtilis resulted in
elongated cells with increased speciﬁc growth rate and improved
enzyme production capacities (Cui et al., 2018).
Compartmentalization of the Pathway
Compartmentalization of the carbaryl degradation pathway has
been proposed for eﬃcient degradation in Pseudomonas sp.
strains C5pp and C7 (Kamini et al., 2018). Carbaryl is proposed
to be transported viapartitioning in the outer membrane and/or
through diﬀusion porins into the periplasmic space. CH, a
periplasmic enzyme, catalyzes the hydrolysis of Carbaryl to 1-
naphthol, which is more recalcitrant, hydrophobic, and toxic.
Localization of CH in the periplasm with lower aﬃnity for
Carbaryl provides controlled formation of 1-naphthol, thuspreventing its accumulation and subsequent toxicity to the cells
(Kamini et al., 2018). The generated 1-naphthol gets transported
viapartition and/or diﬀusion across the inner membrane to the
cytosol which gets hydroxylated by high-aﬃnity 1NH enzyme to
1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, which is further metabolized to the
central carbon pathway.
Preferential Utilization of Aromatic Compounds
Though microbes possess genetic and metabolic abilities to
degrade xenobiotics as the carbon source, the hierarchy
in utilization, i.e., preferential utilization of simple carbon
sources over the complex ones, has been a major barrier for
biodegradation. The presence and utilization of simple carbon
sources represses genes encoding enzymes for the degradation
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org 18 March 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 602445

Mohapatra and Phale Microbial Degradation of Naphthalene and Substituted Naphthalenes
of complex/non-preferred carbon sources like PAHs. A well-
studied example is the utilization of glucose prior to lactose
when both were given together to E. coli (Jacob and Monod,
1965). Pseudomonas are ubiquitously reported to degrade various
PAHs and xenobiotic compounds as the carbon source. The
carbon source utilization hierarchy in pseudomonads is organic
acids >glucose >aromatic compounds (Hylemon and Phibbs,
1972; Collier et al., 1996). However, there is an exception to this.
Interestingly, P. putida CSV86 displays a unique hierarchy with
preferential utilization of aromatics (benzoate, naphthalene, etc.)
over glucose and co-metabolism of aromatics with organic acids
(Basu et al., 2006). In this bacterium, aromatic degradation and
transport genes are not suppressed even in the presence of a
second carbon source like glucose or organic acid. The glucose
transport and metabolic genes are observed to be repressed when
grown on glucoseCaromatics, where aromatics get utilized in
the ﬁrst log phase followed by glucose in the second log phase
(Basu et al., 2006; Choudhary et al., 2017). On the other hand,
the presence of organic acids did not aﬀect the expression of
aromatics metabolism, thus making this bacterium a promising
candidate for biodegradation studies (Phale et al., 2020).
Oxidative Stress Management
It is well established that hydrocarbon biotransformation leads
to oxidative stress and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes
in microbes. Ineﬃcient naphthalene biodegradation, either by
stationary-phase cells or in the presence of toxic compounds,
leads to the generation of ROS (Kang et al., 2006). As naphthalene
degradative enzymes harbor Fe-S clusters, under oxidative
stress, the Fe from haem and Fe-S proteins can be oxidized,
which may lead to protein inactivation. Along with superoxide
dismutase (SOD), ferredoxin-NADPCreductase (Fpr) mediates
reversible redox reactions between NADPC/NADPH and two
molecules of ferredoxin or ﬂavodoxin, thus scavenging the ROS
and repairing Fe-S centers under oxidative stress (Lee et al.,
2006). It has been reported that both Fpr and SodA (SOD)
are inducible under oxidative stress in Pseudomonas, whereas
increased activity of SOD and catalase has been observed during
growth of four Pseudomonas spp. (O1, W1, As1, and G1)
in naphthalene-amended condition (Kang et al., 2006). The
addition of antioxidants like ascorbate or ferrous iron (Fe2C)
has been found to confer higher growth rates on naphthalene.
InRhodococcus erythropolis, growth on naphthalene showed
increased transcription of oxidative stress-related genes of
cytochrome P450: sodA (Fe/Mn superoxide dismutase), sodC
(Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase), and recA (Sazykin et al., 2019).
Comparative quantitative proteomic analysis of naphthalene-
grown cells of Pseudomonas sp. showed upregulation of various
oxidative stress response-related proteins as a strategy to tackle
the stress (Herbst et al., 2013).
Biosurfactant Production
In response to hydrophobic carbon sources, microbes have
been reported to produce biosurfactants which are amphiphilic,
surface-active compounds and assemble at the oil–water or
air–water interface. This aids in pseudo-solubilization and
facilitates the uptake of aromatics for eﬃcient biodegradation(Rahman et al., 2002). Due to these properties, biosurfactants
have a wide application in various industries. The addition
of chemical surfactant or biosurfactants to bacterial culture
displayed increased eﬃciency and rate of degradation of
hydrocarbons. Among biosurfactants, rhamnolipids produced
byPseudomonas aeruginosa are well studied and characterized
(Hisatsuka et al., 1971; Rahman et al., 2002). Besides, other
types of biosurfactants include lipopeptide (viscosin from
P. ﬂuorescens), Emulsan 378 (P. ﬂuorescens) (Rosenberg and Ron,
1999), trehalose dimycolipids from Rhodococcus sp. (Ramdahl,
1985), lichenysins from Bacillus sp. (Saraswathy and Hallberg,
2002), and surfactin from B. subtilis (Siegmund and Wagner,
1991) and B. amyloliquefaciens (Zhi et al., 2017). These potent
surfactants are shown to reduce surface tension from 72 to
<30 dyn/cm, thus resulting in better uptake of hydrocarbons.
The production of various rhamnolipid- and glycolipid-based
biosurfactants has been reported for species members of
Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Burkholderia, etc. while
growing under naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes (Kanga
et al., 1997; Puntus et al., 2005). P. maltophilia CSV89 when
grown on aromatic compounds like naphthoic acid produced an
extracellular biosurfactant, Biosur-Pm (Phale et al., 1995). The
kinetics of Biosur-Pm production suggested its synthesis to be a
growth- and pH-dependent process. Cells were found to produce
a higher amount of Biosur-Pm at neutral pH as compared
with pH 8.5. Cells grown at pH 8.5 were more hydrophobic
with higher aﬃnity toward aromatic and aliphatic compounds
as compared with cells grown at pH 7.0. In Rhodococcus
sp. N6, a higher carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) and iron-
limiting conditions are responsible for the optimum production
of extracellular biosurfactants (Mutalik et al., 2008). Attempts
have been made for the enhanced biosynthesis of biosurfactant
(surfactin) through the optimization of bacterial strains and
fermentation. However, the low surfactant titers (1.0 g/L) in
the medium are a challenge to produce at a large scale (Jiao
et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019). As a result, genetic engineering
methods have been used to enhance its biosynthesis. However,
due to a large-size operon (25 kb) and complex biosynthetic
regulation of quorum sensing system, it has shown to be diﬃcult
to engineer (Jiao et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019). Bacillus spp.
have been engineered to improve surfactin production mainly
through promoter exchanges (srf A operon), overexpression of
the surfactin exporter YerP , and the regulators ComX and PhrC
(Jiao et al., 2017). However, these genetic engineering methods
all resulted in a single or a few gene modiﬁcations, but the
commercial production has still not been achieved. Hence,
further knowledge-based optimizations need to be explored.
FACTORS AFFECTING THE
BIODEGRADATION OF PAHS
The PAH biodegradation studies have been mainly investigated
under standard laboratory conditions. However, at the
contaminated site or environment, numerous abiotic and
biotic factors (temperature, pH, oxygen, nutrient availability,
substrate bioavailability, other xenobiotics, end-product
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org 19 March 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 602445

Mohapatra and Phale Microbial Degradation of Naphthalene and Substituted Naphthalenes
inhibition, etc.) are shown to vary and inﬂuence the degradation
ability of microorganisms.
Temperature has a profound eﬀect on the biodegradation
of PAHs. With increasing temperature, the concentration of
dissolved oxygen decreases, which impacts the metabolism of
aerobic microbes, as they require molecular O 2as one of the
substrates for oxygenases which perform ring-hydroxylating
or ring-cleaving reaction. It is often noted that the increase
in temperature transforms parent PAHs into more toxic
compounds, which inhibits biodegradation (Muller et al., 1998).
It has been observed that many of the PAH-contaminated sites
have extreme pH conditions, for example, acidic mine drainage-
impacted sites (pH 1–4) and alkaline leachate-impacted gas/coal
gasiﬁcation sites (pH 8–12). These conditions are found to impact
biodegradation processes severely. Hence, the addition of suitable
chemicals (having mild to minimum oxido-reductive potential) is
recommended to adjust the pH before application of microbes for
bioremediation like ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrate for
alkaline soil and liming with calcium or magnesium carbonate for
acidic sites (Bowlen et al., 1995; Gupta and Sar, 2020).
The availability of oxygen at impacted sites is a rate-limiting
factor for biodegradation of PAHs. Owing to the oxido-reductive
environmental condition, oxygen is often introduced from an
external source (tilling, air-sparging, and addition of chemicals)
for the in situ bioremediation process (Pardieck et al., 1992).
Odencrantz et al. (1996) have shown the eﬀective bioremediation
of BTEX compounds in a contaminated aquifer after the addition
of magnesium peroxide (O 2-releasing compound). Another
study involving in situ degradation of phenols and BTEX in a
contaminated aquifer has used sodium nitrate through injection
and construction of abstraction wells for eﬀective bioremediation
(Bewley and Webb, 2001).
The availability of nutrients like N, P , K, and Fe is reported to
be essential for eﬀective bioremediation. Thus, supplementation
of these nutrients (referred to as biostimulation) in limiting
concentration is required to enhance the growth of indigenous
microorganisms for eﬀective bioremediation of PAHs (Sarkar
et al., 2020). On the other hand, high/excess nutrient levels were
found to aﬀect the rate of biodegradation of PAHs.
The bioavailability of PAHs in the environment is often
limited due to their low aqueous solubility (hydrophobicity)
and strong tendency to adsorb onto minerals and organic
matter of the matrix (Cornelissen et al., 2005; Rein et al.,
2016). The aqueous solubility of PAHs decreases with increasing
molecular weight, which in turn reduces the bioavailability
in groundwater and surface water. It has also been shown
that aging (retention for a longer time in the environment)
of PAHs renders them more diﬃcult to extract/degrade from
a polluted ecosystem, thus signiﬁcantly impacting the rate of
bioremediation (Luo et al., 2012).
Contaminated environments are usually burdened
with dynamic concentrations of a particular PAH or
combination/mixtures of PAHs, which often limits the
degradation eﬃciency (Penning et al., 1999; Juhasz and Naidu,
2000). The presence of a high concentration of naphthalene
has shown inhibitory eﬀects on the degradation of other PAHs
by bacterial co-cultures (Bouchez et al., 1995). Phenanthrenebiodegradation is reported to be inhibited due to the presence of
a higher concentration of naphthalene and methylnaphthalene
(Stringfellow and Aitken, 1995). In some environments, the
physicochemical transformation processes (photo-oxidation,
chemical oxido-reduction) generate more toxic by-products,
which limit the metabolism of PAHs. Hence, both the amount
and composition (concentration) of PAHs as well as the toxic
(by-)products generated during treatment at the contaminated
sites should be monitored before strategizing the eﬀective in situ
bioremediation plans.
Although much information on pollutant-degrading bacterial
strains, metabolic steps, and enzymes is involved, the ﬁeld-
scale application and bioremediation attempts have yielded
poor results. Such failures can be attributed due to lack of
insights into important factors such as (i) the thermodynamic
feasibility of assembled catabolic networks, (ii) kinetic properties
and regulatory feature of the enzymes, (iii) physicochemical
properties of metabolites, (iv) extent of induction of enzymes, (v)
suppression of degradation pathways by a simple carbon source
like carbohydrates and organic acids, (vi) cross-talk between
metabolic routes, and (vii) stress responses and changes in overall
cell physiology (de Lorenzo, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011; Phale et al.,
2020). In this context, the selection of suitable candidate(s) for
biodegradation is a crucial initial step. Over the years, several
microbes have been considered for application in biodegradation
processes, but no single naturally isolated bacterial strain was
found to possess all the desired characteristics. Hence, metabolic
engineering strategies for optimizing genetic and regulatory
processes are becoming suitable alternatives to improve overall
cell robustness and biodegradation rate (Nielsen et al., 2014).
Recent advancement in the use of systems biology and “omics”
techniques has helped to gain a deeper insight into the
genetic and physiological background of microbes to model
enzymatic reactions and determine the constraints for eﬃcient
elimination. To overcome environmental constraints (factors),
computational tools/databases are assisting in the ﬁne-tuning
of pathways to maximize performance in a cost-eﬀective
manner (Dvorak et al., 2017). In addition, researchers are
developing eﬀective consortia which are shown to degrade
various pollutants based on co-metabolism/synergistic actions
of diﬀerent mutualistic/symbiotic microbes. Further research on
genome-scale metabolic modeling (ﬂuxomic and interactomic)
studies enabled us to unravel the biodegradative behavior of
isolates. In the last decade, BESs including microbial fuel
cells and microbial electrolysis cells have become preferred
options for waste treatment at the industrial scale. By
integrating biological treatment, electrolytic dissociation, and
electrochemical oxidation/reduction, these systems are regarded
as a new sustainable strategy for the treatment of various organic
pollutants with higher treatment eﬃciencies than conventional
processes (Huang et al., 2011; Pant et al., 2012; Nazari et al., 2020).
Especially, the oxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater of
domestic, brewery, and paper-recycling units, food processing
industry, and landﬁll leachate has been successful ( Nazari et al.,
2020). Besides, the catalytic activities of electrochemically active
microorganisms lead to sustainable bioprocessing approaches,
viz. electricity generation, nutrient recovery, formation of

Mohapatra and Phale Microbial Degradation of Naphthalene and Substituted Naphthalenes
value-added by-products, and bioremediation (dehalogenation
and reduction of nitro-organics). With the knowledge of the
participating microbes in biodegradation and their metabolic
potential, several microbial bioremediation approaches such as
biostimulation and bioaugmentation are popularized, which are
elaborated further in the next section. Along with microbes,
the introduction of plants to the polluted site(s) and the use
of plants with microbes as well as composting and biopiling
are increasingly being preferred for contaminant attenuation
in polluted sites.
BIOREMEDIATION STRATEGIES
A contaminated environment is usually found to be deﬁcient in
essential nutrients to support microbial growth and metabolic
processes of potential microbes. Based on the knowledge
of participating microbial members (or communities) and
their nutrient requirement, two major strategies are popularly
used for the bioremediation of contaminated niches, i.e.,
biostimulation and bioaugmentation. In addition, the use of
plants (phytoremediation) either alone or in combination with
potential microbe(s) (phyto-bioremediation) is also preferred as
an eﬀective cleanup procedure. The strategies are depicted in
Figure 8.
Biostimulation refers to the supplementation of one or more
nutrients to the impacted sites for accelerating the growth and
metabolic abilities of microorganisms (Sarkar et al., 2020). The
application of water-soluble inorganic nutrients (NO 2 , NO 3 ,
Fe3C, SO 42 , and CO 2), slow-release fertilizers, and oxygenation
resulted in the increase of the rate of degradation (Sarkar et al.,
2016, 2020). It has been estimated that an optimal ratio of
100:10:1 for C:N:P is required for eﬀective biodegradation of
hydrocarbon pollutants (Dibble and Bartha, 1979; Dias et al.,
2012). Several laboratory studies have shown that excess carbon
(as in PAHs) compared with other nutrients critically aﬀects
the microbial metabolism of hydrocarbons (Sarkar et al., 2020).
Several low-cost nutrients like biochar, sawdust, crop residues,
leaf litter, compost, etc. have been successfully applied to enhance
the growth of microorganisms and remediate contaminated sites
(Simons et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2013). Among all nutrients, nitrate
amendment has been the most eﬀective biostimulating agent
for bioremediation of hydrocarbon pollutants (Roy et al., 2018).
Eﬀective biodegradation (80%) of petroleum sludge containing
400 g/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) was achieved with
nitrate amendment. Increased activity (stimulation) of nitrate-
reducing Azovibrio, Pseudoxanthomonas, Commamonas, and
Bacillus was evident in this study (Sarkar et al., 2016; Roy et al.,
2018). Other studies have also shown a positive eﬀect of either N
or P on the biodegradation of pesticides (Sharma et al., 2019).
Bioaugmentation aims to supplement microbes externally,
either as a single pure culture or mixed culture (consortium), to
enhance the overall metabolic activity for complete degradation.
Pure cultures of Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Sphingomonas,
Achromobacter, Bacillus, and Rhodococcus are promising
bioaugmentation agents. It is observed that the use of mixed
bacterial culture is more advantageous than pure culture dueto synergistic interactions among microbial species (Tyagi
et al., 2011; Ghaly et al., 2013; Sarkar et al., 2020). The use of
consortium harboring Delftia, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas
resinovorans, P. ﬂuorescens, Exiguobacterium, Arthrobacter,
and R. erythropolis has been eﬀective for the bioremediation of
diesel-contaminated soil (Sprocati et al., 2012). A consortium of
Aeromonas, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, Gordonia, P. ﬂuorescens,
P. putida, Rhodococcus equi, S. maltophilia, and Xanthomonas
has shown 89% degradation of various hydrocarbons in a soil
column within a year (Szulc et al., 2014). A combinatorial
approach where both biostimulation and bioaugmentation
are applied led to a more eﬀective bioremediation of PAHs
and short- and long-chain alkanes for various hydrocarbon-
impacted niches (Sarkar et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). The use
of microbial consortium harboring various Pseudomonas spp.
and other gamma-proteobacteria members in combination with
NH 4NO 3and K 2HPO 4is an eﬀective strategy for total petroleum
hydrocarbon degradation (Varjani et al., 2015).
Plants (native and adapted species) are also used to remove
aromatic pollutants from contaminated sites and are referred
to as phytoremediation. Moreover, it particularly suits to the
treatment of larger areas of surface contamination, where other
methods may not be as eﬀective. Several species of either native
plants or grasses (Agropyron, Bouteloua, Cyanodondactylon,
Elymus, Festuca, Melilotus, etc.) or legumes (Alfalfa) are popularly
used to degrade various PAHs (Harvey et al., 2002; Hall et al.,
2011; Truu et al., 2015). A combined use of diﬀerent types of
grasses was shown to be eﬀective for phytoremediation of various
PAHs and pesticides in sandy loam soils (Lalande et al., 2003;
Basumatary et al., 2012). These plants have also shown to release
various metabolites (amino acids, sugars, inorganic nutrients)
and enzymes (dehalogenase, reductase, peroxidase, laccase, etc.)
in the root exudates. This helps to enhance the growth and
metabolic activities of rhizospheric microbes, or they interact
directly with PAHs to biotransform. Various studies have also
shown that the combined use of plants and microbes is an
emerging cost-eﬀective technique for contaminant removal for
maximum eﬃciency with minimum environmental disturbances
(Figure 8). The application of such techniques with agricultural
management methods like integrated nutrient management,
water use, crop rotation, and other agronomic practices will
help in the complete removal/cleaning up of such pesticide
pollutants as well as xenobiotics from the agricultural ﬁelds and
contaminated site.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION
The contaminated ecosystems harbor vast microbial diversity
with dynamic metabolic ﬂexibility. However, it often
lacks suitable conditions, i.e., robust microbial members
with metabolic pathways and its regulation for complete
mineralization, nutrients required for metabolism, and other
biotic/abiotic factors. Hence, designing appropriate microbial
host(s) with eﬃcient, rapid, and broad range of degradation
abilities is a key factor in the scaling up of the bioremediation
process. In addition, other properties like chemotaxis, cell

surface/membrane ﬂuidity, compartmentalization of pathway,
and biosurfactant production are advantageous for the enhanced
metabolism of PAHs. Furthermore, organisms capable of
degrading a broad range of PAHs with genotypic and
phenotypic stability of degradation trait, i.e., chromosomal
origin and microbes with preferential utilization of such
pollutants even in the presence of a simple carbon source like
carbohydrates or organic acids, are of immense importance
for eﬃcient bioremediation. The use of next-generation and
high-throughput molecular and computational tools is most
valuable for understanding system biology of suitable xenobioticdegrading microbes. Since natural bioremediation is a slow and
complex process, a system biology-based platform will be of
much value for metabolic engineering (patchwork assembly,
gene shuﬄing, and genome editing) of microbes for the
reconstruction of new pathways and robust microbial chassis.
The use of BESs incorporating metabolically robust microbial
hosts as microbial fuel cells and microbial electrocatalytic
cells might be an alternative approach for the treatment of
a wider varieties of pollutants. The combined implication of
omics—genomics, metagenomics, metagenome-assisted genome
assemblies, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and

phenomics—would further aid in understanding the complex
behavior of microbes, ﬁne-tuning of selected biochemical routes,
its networks, and whole-cell biocatalysis. In addition, more
advanced computational tools are required to fully exploit
the omics-derived data for better functional assignments and
understanding metabolic ﬂuxes and their interactions. In
recent days, adaptive laboratory evolution has been frequently
used to transform the desired properties in environmental
bacteria and for the ﬁne-tuning of recombinant microorganisms.
Exposing microorganisms with desirable target chemical
pollutant(s) for prolonged duration enabled the isolation of
potent degrading bacteria. Screening and identiﬁcation of potent
plant growth-promoting and pollutant-degrading microbes
would be of added value for increasing crop yield/productivity
in agroecosystems and the biodegradation of xenobiotics like
pesticides simultaneously. The development of integrated
platforms which might provide all the information related to
bioremediation research, including data, analytical methods,
and pipelines, is the current need of the hour. In the context
of the use of genetically engineered microbes for pollutant
biodegradation, public environmental concerns and regulatory
constraints have delimited the ﬁeld tests of microbes and
also have aﬀected the quality and progress of biotechnological
research. So, better knowledge dissemination, popularization
of achievements, and mass awareness on the beneﬁcial use of
engineered microbes must be a priority. Together with this,
cross-border coordination through scientists/working groups
around the world in diﬀerent laboratories for data sharingand database maintenance would further help in rationalizing
bioremediation plans. The use of cybernetics, artiﬁcial
intelligence, nano-bioremediation (nanoscale zero-valent
metals/nano-organics), agricultural/agronomic management
practices, etc. will enable further value addition and cost
reduction of sustainable on-site bioremediation strategies in the
near future.

Phenyl urea herbicides are being extensively used for weed control in both agricultural
and non-agricultural applications. Linuron is one of the key herbicides in this family and is
in wide use. Like other phenyl urea herbicides, it is known to have toxic effects as a result
of its persistence in the environment. The natural removal of linuron from the environment
is mainly carried through microbial biodegradation. Some microorganisms have been
reported to mineralize linuron completely and utilize it as a carbon and nitrogen source.
Variovorax sp. strain SRS 16 is one of the known efﬁcient degraders with a recently
sequenced genome. The genomic data provide an opportunity to use a genome-
scale model for improving biodegradation. The aim of our study is the construction
of a genome-scale metabolic model following automatic and manual protocols and its
application for improving its metabolic potential through iterative simulations. Applying
ﬂux balance analysis (FBA), growth and degradation performances of SRS 16 in different
media considering the inﬂuence of selected supplements (potential carbon and nitrogen
sources) were simulated. Outcomes are predictions for the suitable media modiﬁcation,
allowing faster degradation of linuron by SRS 16. Seven metabolites were selected
forin vitro validation of the predictions through laboratory experiments conﬁrming the
degradation-promoting effect of speciﬁc amino acids (glutamine and asparagine) on
linuron degradation and SRS 16 growth. Overall, simulations are shown to be efﬁcient in
predicting the degradation potential of SRS 16 in the presence of speciﬁc supplements.
The generated information contributes to the understanding of the biochemistry of
linuron degradation and can be further utilized for the development of new cleanup
solutions without any genetic manipulation.

Dhakar et al. Linuron Degradation by Variovorax sp. Strain SRS 16
INTRODUCTION
Phenyl urea herbicides are among the most widely used
herbicides for weed control in several crops (mostly cereals)
through their pre- or post-emergence applications. These
substances interrupt electron transfer in photosystem II, leading
to the formation of reactive oxygen species and resulting in
cell damage (Liu, 2010). The increased rate of application
of xenobiotics such as the phenyl urea herbicides in recent
years enhanced their burden to the environment due to their
persistence in the surroundings (Hasanuzzaman et al., 2020).
These compounds are consistently found to have negative
eﬀects on the ecosystem, including hazards to human health
(de Souza et al., 2020; Garcês et al., 2020). Linuron has been
one of the most widely applied phenyl urea herbicides in
agriculture practice, also reported as an environmental pollutant
(Dejonghe et al., 2003; Horemans et al., 2016). Remediating the
environment from the accumulated toxic substances is the focus
of a growing number of researches eﬀorts. The degradation or the
removal of such pollutants is reported to be conducted through
physical, (photo-)chemical, and chemical processes (Katsumata
et al., 2011; Reddy and Kim, 2015; Kovács et al., 2016; Hao
et al., 2019; Bhat et al., 2020). Microorganisms play a major
role in the biological removal of linuron. So far, diﬀerent
strategies have been approached for enhancing biodegradation
and bioremediation (Raman and Chandra, 2009; Pimviriyakul
et al., 2020). By promoting the growth of soil microbial degraders,
soil amendments are being used in order to accelerate the removal
rate of pollutants (Bao et al., 2020). However, the selection of the
amendments is mostly based on trial and error.
Biodegradation of linuron is generally initiated by amidase
hydrolases, which leads to the formation of a more toxic
intermediate, 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA). DCA further degrades
to metabolites that can be consumed in the central metabolism
of the microorganisms. However, partial degradation of
linuron produces chloroanilines that are more toxic than
linuron itself. Bacterial genera such as Arthrobacter, Bacillus,
Comamonas, Pseudomonas, Sphingobium, and Variovorax are
able to degrade/transform linuron in various environments
either in isolation or as part of a consortium (Turnbull et al.,
2001; Dejonghe et al., 2003; Lerner et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,
2020). Variovorax SRS 16 is widely studied for its ability to utilize
linuron as a sole carbon and nitrogen source. Variovorax SRS 16
also possesses a modiﬁed chlorocatechol ortho-cleavage pathway,
allowing the utilization of linuron as a substrate for growth. The
presence of the amidase (speciﬁc linuron hydrolase) and gene
clusters which are responsible for the degradation of linuron and
dichloroaniline in SRS 16 has been described in detail with the
support of proteomic studies (Bers et al., 2011). Based on the
relatively extensive phenotypic information, together with the
publication of its genome sequence (Sørensen et al., 2005; Bers
et al., 2011), Variovorax SRS 16 is recognized as a good model for
exploring biodegradation of phenyl urea herbicides.
Processing genomic information into a metabolic model
is increasingly used as a route for generating a predictive
tool to elucidate and manipulate cellular biochemical activity.
Genome-scale metabolic modeling has been proven as an eﬃcientapproach to decode the genomic and functional information for a
speciﬁc phenotype by investigating the gene–protein interactions
on a cellular level (Thiele and Palsson, 2010; Gu et al., 2019). To
construct metabolic models, some preliminary information on
physiological requirements (mainly of growth) of the organism
is needed for better curation and to ensure the appropriate
functioning of the model (Covert et al., 2001). This approach
generally follows some deﬁned steps such as collecting basic
information related to the conditions required for growth of cells
together with description of the metabolism of the organism
based on its genome sequence. Conversion of this information
into a mathematical framework, as a model, is the next step.
Further, the behavior of the model can be predicted under speciﬁc
growth conditions along with biomass generation and exchange
(uptake or release) of relevant compounds (metabolites). In the
ﬁnal step, experiments are carried out to validate the predictions
(Devoid et al., 2013). Genome-scale modeling is considered
advantageous as it allows screening of multiple conditions in a
short time and lowering of cost by providing a limited set of
solutions that can be further tested. Solutions that enhance a
desired or improved behavior of the organism can be predicted
based on media supplementations without any requirement of
genetic modiﬁcation (García-Jiménez et al., 2018).
The importance of these models as a tool for rapid
biodegradation and for the development of eﬀective
bioremediation strategies is recognized (Scheibe et al., 2009)
and demonstrated in a few studies. For example, a metabolic
model of Ralstonia eutropha H16, a microorganism with multiple
potential applications in environmental biotechnology, was
used to analyze its metabolic characteristics (Park et al., 2011).
The genome-scale model of Pseudomonas veronii 1YdBTEX2,
a degrader of monoaromatic compounds, was used together
with ‘omics data (transcriptomics and exometabolomics) to
characterize active metabolic processes at diﬀerent growth stages.
The matching of predictions with bacterial response indicates
the importance of modeling to enhance the success rate of
bio-inoculants in complex systems (Hadadi et al., 2020). Such
studies help to predict the changes in cellular processes under
a speciﬁc given condition (e.g., xenobiotic biodegradation).
In addition, such integrative “omics modeling” approaches
have also been used for optimization of predeﬁned processes
(Calmels et al., 2019). Xu et al. (2019) used models constructed
for indigenous species whose abundance in soil was aﬀected by
exposure to the herbicide atrazine. The community modeling
revealed interspecies metabolic interactions that support
enhanced growth and degradation. The simulations pointed at
a contribution of non-degrader species to the in situ process
achieved thorough trophic exchanges with the degrader (Faust,
2019). The eﬀect of speciﬁc metabolites on the degradation rate
of atrazine by Paenarthrobacter aurescens TC1 was predicted
by a genome-scale model and was further validated in vitro
(Ofaim et al., 2020). The predictive biology facilitated the
identiﬁcation of optimal conditions for degradation that can
promote the development of bioaugmentation or biostimulation
approaches for better controlling the degradation processes.
One bottleneck of bioaugmentation is that in many cases,
the exogenous degrading microorganisms fail to establish in

a new environment and do not produce enough biomass to
eliminate contaminants in situ. Stimulating the growth of
native degraders through adding speciﬁc compounds to the
contaminated site is a practical alternative to bioaugmentation.
The present study aims to elucidate the eﬀect of nutritional
supplements on linuron degradation by Variovorax SRS 16 (as a
model for native degraders) and estimate their potential usage as
biostimulants in order to harness the full potential of indigenous
degraders. SRS 16 was selected due to the availability of a fully
sequenced genome and extensive biochemical knowledge of its
full pathway in linuron degradation – a pollutant that belongs
to a large contaminant group of the phenyl urea herbicides.
A genome-scale metabolic model of SRS 16 was constructed
following automatic and manual protocols and was applied to
explore the stimulating eﬀect of diﬀerent supplements through
iterative simulations Compounds pointed by simulations as
strong enhancers of degradation were further validated through
wet laboratory experiments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Constraint-Based Reconstruction
As a ﬁrst step, a draft model of Variovorax sp. SRS 16
was reconstructed by following a bottom-up approach as
elaborated by Ofaim et al. (2020). Brieﬂy, the whole-genome
sequence of SRS 16 was retrieved from the genome database
of NCBI and annotated using RAST (Overbeek et al., 2014).
An initial metabolic reconstruction was obtained by analyzing
the annotated genome sequence through Model SEED (Faria
et al., 2018). The metabolic reconstruction has three main
components: a complete list of reactions and their associatedgenes, information of interactions between the gene and protein
associated with the metabolic reaction, and the components
involved in biomass generation (Devoid et al., 2013). The list of
reactions contains the biomass (which includes all the biomass
constituents and their fractional status), cytosolic, transport,
and exchange reactions. The model was improved by adding
potentially missing reactions through an automated gap-ﬁlling
process (Henry et al., 2010). The improved draft model was
exported to Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format
from Model SEED.
The reactions in the original model were complemented
by reactions described for Variovorax SRS 16 in additional
genomic annotation databases including BiGG (Norsigian et al.,
2020), KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2016), UniProt (The UniProt
Consortium, 2019), IMG (Chen et al., 2019), and MetaCyc (Karp,
2002). Reactions were included according to EC accessions.
Reaction stoichiometries were veriﬁed for all reactions, and non-
balanced reactions were ﬁxed. Directionality and stoichiometry
of reactions were determined according to the KEGG scheme.
Speciﬁc reactions involved in linuron degradation were added
based on a literature survey (Figure 1). The reconstruction was
curated to verify that it allows the generation of all biomass
components under physiologically feasible minimal conditions –
minimal salt solution and linuron (Supplementary File 1). The
Variovorax sp. SRS 16 model in SBML format is provided in
Supplementary File 2.
Simulations of Growth and Degradation
of Linuron Using Flux Balance Analysis
Simulations were carried out using ﬂux balance analysis (FBA),
allowing us to depict cellular processes based on cellular
reconstructions (Rana et al., 2020). Brieﬂy, FBA follows the law
FIGURE 1 | Possible fate of linuron and 3,4-DCA in SRS 16. Reactions in black were included in the automatic reconstruction. Reactions in red were manually
added to the model. Pathway 1 (modiﬁed ortho-cleavage pathway) was retrieved from BioCyc based on direct evidence for Variovorax SRS 16 strain
(https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-7496). Pathways 2 and 3 (ortho- and meta-cleavage pathways, respectively) were completed
by following the generic KEGG pathways.

of mass conservation and consider the metabolic framework
as a static stoichiometric matrix (metabolites reactions).
FBA describes the predicted ﬂux distribution through linear
optimization by targeting speciﬁc cellular objectives (mainly
growth). In the present study, the growth of the model was
chosen as the objective function through the maximization of the
biomass reaction. Flux variability analysis (FV A) was carried out
to account for the possible ﬂow of ﬂuxes involved in secretion
and uptake of all metabolites (Mahadevan and Schilling, 2003).
The simulations were applied to predict biomass generation and
linuron degradation over a time period under a range of deﬁned
conditions – in silico growth media. All simulations were carried
out under deﬁnitions that follow experimentally veriﬁed viable
conditions in minimal media with linuron (Supplementary
File 3) and 120 exchange metabolites (one at a time) representing
an alternative carbon/nitrogen source or other supplements
(Supplementary File 4).
Dynamic modeling was used for the prediction of the proﬁle
of consuming metabolites typical to the biomass increase and
linuron degradation across time. To this end, we simulated the
behavior of our metabolic model across time. The simulation
process follows (Xu et al., 2019; Ofaim et al., 2020) and is
illustrated in Supplementary File 5. Brieﬂy, the model works
under the following assumptions: (1) a ﬁnite start amount of
media components is available; (2) a maximal amount of uptake
a single cell can acquire from the media in a given time point
is deﬁned (the lower bound of the exchange reaction value); (3)
new substrate concentrations in each time point are determined
by the predicted substrate concentration for the previous step
augmented with any additional substrates provided or consumed
in the current iteration. The maximum uptake was set to a ratio
of up to 1 unit of each metabolite available in the media; (4) after
each time tick, the biomass amount was updated according to the
ﬂux amount of the biomass reaction in the model at this time
tick. As the biomass production rate serves as a proxy for the
size of the population in the simulated environment and substrate
uptake/secretion is mainly aﬀected by population size, the model
was used to evaluate the actual substrate uptake and growth rate
given the supplied media across time.
Simulations were carried out until a state where time cycles
did not lead to an increase in biomass was reached. Initial
concentration values for all metabolites were set to a ﬁxed
amount of 50 units (represented as the initial lower bounds, LB,
of the exchange reactions). The upper bound of the exchange
reactions was set to 1,000 units to allow the secretion of all
the exchange metabolites. Reversible non-exchange reactions’
lower bound was 1,000 units, and for non-exchange non-
reversible reactions, it is 0 units; the upper bound for non-
exchange reactions was 1,000 units. At each growth cycle, the
generation of biomass is updated on the basis of ﬂux ﬂow in the
biomass reaction. The algorithm assumes that media components
are available to all growing cells with equal probability. The
growth rate and the ﬂux of substrate (consumed or secreted)
associated with the model in the given media conditions are
calculated at every time point, where, in each cycle, we try
to maximize the biomass of each member of the community
and then we ﬁxate the biomass and minimize the uptake ofmetabolites of each member while maintaining the max biomass
found. The cycles of predictions were carried out until the
saturation point appeared in the biomass production (no growth
recorded reﬂecting the exhaustion of given resources). Starting
with one bacterial cell, the ﬂux balance model was used to
predict the uptake of carbon and nitrogen sources (including
linuron) across time.
All model simulations were done on an Intel i7 quad-core
server with 32 GB of memory, running Linux. The development
programming language of our simulators was JAV A, and our
linear programming software was IBM CPLEX.
In vitro Experiments of Variovorax sp.
SRS 16 Strain: Growth and Linuron
Degradation
Variovorax sp. strain SRS 16 (NCBI: txid282217, kindly provided
by Dirk Springael, KU Leuven) was revived from stock cultures
stored in glycerol at  80C. The purity and authenticity of the
strain were checked by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The minimal
medium (Supplementary File 3) described by Sørensen and
Aamand (2003) was prepared, and bacterial cells were grown
on agar plates at 25C. For the quantitative analysis, 250 ml
ﬂasks were used to prepare the minimal medium (50 ml of
the medium per ﬂask) and autoclaved. The eﬀects of the seven
selected substrates – representing strong, moderate, and weak
enhancers of linuron degradation – on growth and linuron
degradation were tested. The supplements (ﬁlter sterilized) were
added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.12 mM in media (equivalent
to 30 ppm of linuron). The linuron concentration was selected
on the basis of a previous study. MS, MS CC, and MSCN
consist of only minimal medium, minimal media added with only
carbon (glucose), and minimal media added with only nitrogen
(ammonium salt), respectively. MS was treated as a negative
control. The autoclaved minimal medium was supplemented
with the substrates (separately) and linuron (30 ppm) followed
by bacterial inoculation to a ﬁnal OD (at 600 nm) of 0.05–
0.1. The mother culture was raised in MSCN (succinic acid
and ammonium salt) medium with linuron, by inoculating fresh
agar plate-grown bacterial cells followed by incubation at 25C
(120 rpm) for 24 h.
All the inoculated ﬂasks were incubated at 25C (120 rpm) for
7 days. Bacterial growth and linuron degradation were monitored
at deﬁnite intervals (zeroth day, third day, ﬁfth day, and seventh
day) from the day of inoculation. For bacterial growth, 200 ml was
taken, and OD was measured at 600 nm by using InﬁniteR200
PRO (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland). Linuron degradation was
measured through HPLC with standard procedures. Brieﬂy, 1 ml
of sample was taken and centrifuged at 10,000 gfor 5 min. The
supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.22 mm PTFE syringe ﬁlter
and transferred to the HPLC vials for the detection of residual
linuron. Linuron and DCA were analyzed by using Agilent 1100
HPLC (Waldbronn, Germany). Detection of linuron was done at
240 nm using the external calibration method (sensitivity 0.5 mg

RESULTS
Reconstruction of Genome-Scale
Metabolic Network for Variovorax sp.
Strain SRS 16
The genome of Variovorax sp. strain SRS 16 is about 7.7 Mb
in size, including its chromosome (5.7 Mb) and four plasmids
with an approximate size of <1 Mb each (Öztürk et al., 2020).
The complete sequence was retrieved from NCBI and annotated
for reconstruction using the Model SEED pipeline. This initial
reconstruction contained a list of 2,150 gene–protein–reaction
associations that were classiﬁed as exchange, transport, and
cytosolic as well as a list of all relevant metabolites and a
biomass reaction. Based on the taxonomic classiﬁcation, the
biomass reaction was deﬁned as Gram-negative bacteria in
the Model SEED reconstruction pipeline. The composition of
the biomass reaction summarizes the fractional contribution
of generalized microbial biomass precursors (e.g., amino acids
and lipids) to the synthesis of a new cell and is similar to the
previously published genome-scale reconstruction of Escherichia
coli strain K-12 (Monk et al., 2017). Initial simulations were
carried out for debugging and removing futile or erroneously
energy-generating loops. To this end, all external ﬂuxes were
blocked (upper and lower bounds set to zero). Next, a minimal
medium was used, verifying that growth requires the supply
of both carbon and nitrogen sources. After establishing no
growth under infeasible conditions, we tested growth (biomass
production) under experimentally veriﬁed conditions (succinic
acid and ammonium salt as a carbon and nitrogen source,
respectively) as described by Sørensen et al. (2009). Fine tuning
of growth simulations to correctly represent the bacteria’s biology
was done by manual curation. This included manual gap ﬁlling
(addition of spontaneous and literature-supported reactions) and
curation of reaction directionality.
The reconstructed metabolic network presented here covers
19.2% of the open reading frames (ORFs) present in the genome
(Table 1). The coverage is lower than gold standard models of
other Gram-negative models such as iAF1260 for Escherichia
(Feist et al., 2010) (29%), iPC1209 for Pectobacterium (Wang
et al., 2015), and iPAO1 for Pseudomonas (25.8%) (Zhu et al.,
2018). It is, however, similar to coverage obtained for the genome-
scale reconstruction of the closely related genus Rhodoferax
ferrireducens (from the same family Comamonadaceae) – 15.6%
(Risso et al., 2009). Total number of reactions is similar to
gold standard reconstruction including the updated model of
E. coli str. K-12 (Orth et al., 2011). A detailed description of
the network including the reactions, metabolites, genes, and
compartments that comprise the network is provided in Table 1.TABLE 1 | Functional details of the Variovorax sp. SRS 16 model.

Adapting and Curating iRZ1425 for
Modeling Linuron Degradation
Model reactions involved in linuron degradation and their
complete link to the core metabolism were added manually
based on the detailed reports of the relevant pathways in the
speciﬁc strain as well as in other bacterial species, forming
three possible pathways (Figure 1). In Pathway 1, degradation
occurs via modiﬁed ortho-cleavage, where in the ﬁrst step,
there is a ring cleavage in DCA; then, chloro intermediates
transform into maleylacetate and ﬁnally enter the citric acid
cycle. The pathway was described by Bers et al. (2011) based on
the study of linuron degradation in Variovorax SRS 16 and is
supported in part by molecular evidence. Notably, none of the
reactions in the modiﬁed ortho-cleavage pathway was identiﬁed
by automatic reconstruction. Alternatively, we also included
two hypothetical pathways (not speciﬁcally detected for SRS
16), Pathways 2 and 3 (Figure 1), for the degradation of the
herbicide hydrolysis product (Arora, 2015; Hussain et al., 2015).
Pathway 2 follows the removal of successive dehalogenation
and the formation of aniline from DCA. The product aniline
enters the ortho-cleavage pathway through catechol to the
core metabolism. Pathway 3 begins with the dehalogenation of
DCA with the formation of 4-chloroaniline. 4-Chloroaniline is
further converted to catechol derivatives, which leads to the
meta-cleavage pathway. Some of the enzymes involved in these
pathways were detected as part of the automatic reconstruction,
and missing reactions were manually added (Figure 1). In the
present study, simulations were carried out considering all three
pathways, with Pathway 1 only and with Pathways 2 and 3
together; the same results were obtained when considering all the
pathways together and with Pathway 1 only. The Variovorax sp.
SRS 16 strain is documented to grow on linuron alone as it utilizes
linuron as a sole carbon and nitrogen source in minimal media
(Sørensen and Aamand, 2003). Sørensen et al. (2009) reported
a strong enhancing eﬀect of nitrogen (ammonium sulfate) on
the degradation rate but not of carbon. These experimental

Dhakar et al. Linuron Degradation by Variovorax sp. Strain SRS 16
observations were successfully captured by model simulations,
indicating a stronger impact of nitrogen supplement (ammonium
sulfate) over a carbon supplement (glucose) as enhancers of
degradation. Simulation outcomes are consistent while using
diﬀerent pathway alternatives (Figure 2). In accordance with
the documented mineralization of linuron (Sørensen et al.,
2009), simulations indicate that linuron is converted into
central-metabolism metabolites and biomass, where none of
the degradation by-products (Figure 1) accumulate in the
medium. The predicted production of biomass is fully correlated
with linuron degradation (Supplementary File 6), providing
additional evidence of full degradation.
Simulation-Based Predictions for
Potential Enhancers of Linuron
Degradation
The SRS 16 linuron degradation behavior under the inﬂuence
of speciﬁc carbon (succinic acid) and nitrogen (ammonium
salt) sources was extensively studied and reported (Sørensen
et al., 2009). Here, we used simulations to further explore
the eﬀect of media supplements that can serve as potential
degradation enhancers. We simulated growth in 120 diﬀerent
media combinations, each supplementing the linuron-containing
minimal mineral media with a single exchange metabolite. The
list of metabolites, following omission of 20 toxic and other non-
relevant substances (considering future application in soil) such
as diuron and dipeptides, is provided in Supplementary File 4.
The eﬀect of 28 exchange supplements selected across the full
scale of degradation eﬃciency is shown in Figure 3. Selectedmetabolites were chosen to represent the biochemical diversity
of carbon (simple sugars, organic acids, and biopolymers) and
nitrogen (mainly amino acids, amine, and ammonium) sources
that can act as future biostimulants in terms of regulation, costs,
and accessibility. Simulations for all compounds were carried
out considering both the SRS 16-speciﬁc pathway (Pathway
1,Supplementary File 7) and generic degradation pathways
(Pathways 2 and 3, Figure 3). Diﬀerent supplements were
predicted to have variable impact on the growth of Variovorax
SRS 16 and the degradation rate of linuron. In a reference
medium containing linuron only (MS), 40% of the linuron
was degraded at the 11th simulation round. The predictions
stratify a group of enhancers with variable degrees of linuron
degradation in the 11th iteration (>40–100%), in comparison
to non-enhancers (40% linuron degradation, as in MS). All
the carbon sources and several amino acids (arginine, lysine,
methionine, cysteine, and tryptophan) were classiﬁed as non-
enhancers vs. nitrogen sources that are predicted to expedite
degradation at various degrees, with some variations depending
on the simulation pathways used. Overall, considering the
diﬀerent pathway options, the rate of degradation broadly
follows the same trend where most amino acids act as moderate
enhancers, where on the 11th round, 50–75% of linuron is
degraded. Fast enhancers include glutamine and asparagine
(100% degraded in the ﬁnal, 14th, round in comparison to
60% in MS). Though groups of enhancers vs. non-enhancers are
similar when considering both simulation pathways (Figure 3
and Supplementary File 7), diﬀerences are observed in internal
ranking as presented in Figure 4. The major diﬀerence found
is that in Pathway 1, methionine and cysteine inﬂuence the
FIGURE 2 | Simulated linuron degradation in the modiﬁed media SRS 16 model considering Pathway 1 (A)and Pathways 2 and 3 (B). Simulations were carried out
in minimal mineral media (MS) with linuron supplemented by nitrogen (ammonium sulfate) or carbon (succinate) sources (MS_N and MS_C, respectively).

In vitro Validation of Potential Enhancers
of Linuron Degradation by Variovorax sp.
SRS 16
Seven metabolites representing a range of predicted degradation
enhancement potential and biochemical characteristics
(Figure 3) were selected for validation. These metabolites
include glutamine and asparagine as strong enhancers; aniline
as a moderate enhancer; arginine, oxalic acid, and catechol as
weak enhancers (Figure 3); and methionine whose enhancement
potential depends on the choice of simulation pathway (non-
enhancer in Pathway 1 and strong enhancer in Pathways 2 and
3,Figure 4). The simulations (growth and degradation) for
the seven selected substrates assuming degradation Pathways
2 and 3 are shown in Figure 5. Simulations considering
Pathways 1 and degradation Pathways 1–3 are shown in
Supplementary File 8. Overall, the laboratory experiments
supported predictions in the majority of the cases. Growth
experiments (Figure 5B) are fully consistent with predictions,
dividing supplement as non-enhancers vs. enhancers. In
agreement with predictions, a slow (negligible) growth rate was
found in MS and in MS supplemented by arginine, catechol,
aniline, and methionine. A signiﬁcantly higher growth rate
was recorded in the presence of glutamine and asparagine(p<0.05). Degradation results (Figure 5D) are overall
consistent with growth results (Figure 5B), with signiﬁcant
stratiﬁcation of enhancers (glutamine and asparagine) vs
non-enhancers (p <0.05). Aniline and methionine had a
non-signiﬁcantly stronger enhancement eﬀect in comparison to
MS and were classiﬁed into the non-enhancers group (p <0.05
repeated-measures ANOV A), consistent with simulations in
Pathways 2 and 3.
The results provide an insight that some supplements
(associated with nitrogen metabolism) have a strong enhancing
eﬀect that helps in the conversion of linuron into potential
cellular building blocks.
DISCUSSION
Linuron is considered a stable phenyl urea herbicide. Under ﬁeld
conditions, the half-life of linuron varies from 30 to 150 days
in diﬀerent soil types, with an estimated average half-life of
60 days (Swarcewicz et al., 2013). DCA, its primary degradation
intermediate, is reported to be more toxic. Therefore, complete
mineralization of this compound is desired. Variovorax SRS
16, a member of a genus reported as an eﬃcient degrader
of phenyl urea herbicide, is widely known for its ability to
mineralize linuron (Sørensen et al., 2009). Stimulating the growth
of this degrader through adding compounds to a contaminated
site is a potential strategy for enhancing its activity while

bypassing the need of introducing exogenous microbes. Here,
we describe the construction of a genome-scale metabolic
model of Variovorax sp. strain SRS 16 aiming at ﬁnding
model-based solutions for accelerating its linuron degradation
activity. Construction followed automatic and manual protocols,
and iterative simulations were applied for predicting potential
compounds that promote the degradation of linuron. Predictions
for signiﬁcant degradation enhancers were conﬁrmed by wet
laboratory experiments.
Although, overall, the study demonstrates that model
predictions can guide metabolic exploration toward predicting
biochemical routes leading to enhanced degradation activity,
several limitations of this work should be acknowledged. First,
further adaptations are required for the current version of
iRZ1425 to meet the requirements of gold standard models
(Thiele and Palsson, 2010). Mainly, the biomass compositionis an approximation that relies on automatic protocols and
genomic information (Oh et al., 2007; Henry et al., 2010),
similar to other recent works (Bordel et al., 2019; Naizabekov
and Lee, 2020; Ofaim et al., 2020). The construction of a
biomass reaction speciﬁc to the SRS 16 reaction requires layers
of experimental data that are currently missing, including
the precursors of general biomass constructions (for example,
proteins, lipids, and species-speciﬁc components). Collection of
currently lacking experimental data will be incorporated in future
versions of the model to deﬁne an accurate biomass objective
function using, for example, the BOFdat computational platform
(Lachance et al., 2019). Second, though the current analysis
demonstrates the use of model-based solutions for accelerating
linuron degradation activity, the mechanism explaining the
diﬀerent eﬀects of the metabolites tested remains unaddressed

current study as well as previous reports (Sørensen et al., 2009),
clearly point to nitrogenous compounds being advantageous
in comparison to carbon ones. However, nitrogen content
per se is insuﬃcient for predicting the stimulating eﬀect
of compounds, and degradation eﬃciency cannot be ranked
according to N content or to the C:N ratio. For example,
the eﬃcient stimulants glutamine and asparagine have C:N
ratios of 5:2 and 4:2, respectively, in comparison to 6:4 in
the non-eﬃcient supplement arginine (Supplementary File 4).
Simulation outcomes cannot be predetermined based solely on
the C and/or N content of media supplements but rather by
considering the complementary stoichiometric eﬀect of multiple
chemical reaction cascades, or pathways, that construct the
genome-scale metabolic network. Similarly, simulation outcomes
cannot be predicted based on compound structural properties,
for example, diﬀerent biostimulation potential of the two
peripheral aromatic compounds, aniline and catechol.
Thus, the simulation predictions reﬂect the complexity of
cellular processes and the balance between diﬀerent metabolic
pathways contributing to growth. The simulations provide
multiple optimal solutions for the internal ﬂuxes involved in
central metabolism and hence are not suﬃcient for deciphering
the mechanism by which environmental (media dependent)
conditions aﬀect linuron degradation. However, the integrationof simulation data with ‘omics data (e.g., metabolomics,
proteomics, and transcriptomics) can reduce the solution space
and shed light on the ﬁne-tuning of cellular activity, considering
the need to balance between myriads of constraints. The model
provides a platform for future sequential studies through the
integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic data (similar to
Hadadi et al., 2020), allowing the exploration of the mechanism
of linuron degradation as well as other aspects of Variovorax
sp. strain SRS 16 biochemistry. Such additional experiments are
required in order to complement model predictions regarding
the mechanism behind accelerating the phenomenon. For
example, transcriptomics/proteomics studies targeting the eﬀect
of diﬀerent media supplements (e.g., amino acids) would be
beneﬁcial to track the molecular processes considering diﬀerent
degradation scenarios.
Though current analysis requires additional layers on
information in order to provide a description of the degradation
mechanism, the analysis provides several insights that can
be further explored in future studies. Model construction
suggests three alternative routes for the degradation of linuron.
Pathway 1 (modiﬁed ortho-cleavage pathway) relies on a detailed
description of linuron degradation at strain level (Öztürk
et al., 2020). Variovorax SRS 16 was reported to contain the
gene coding for the amidase LibA, which hydrolyzes linuron

Dhakar et al. Linuron Degradation by Variovorax sp. Strain SRS 16
inN,O-dimethyl hydroxylamine and DCA. The catabolic
pathway for DCA degradation into components of central
metabolism is suggested to involve conversion of 4,5-
dichlorocatechol to oxoadipate (modiﬁed ortho-cleavage
pathway) (Bers et al., 2011). Alternative degradation pathways
of DCA were reported in other bacterial genera (Dejonghe
et al., 2002; Breugelmans et al., 2010). In the current study,
automatic construction based on the SRS 16 genome sequence
suggested the partial presence of enzymes in chloroaniline or
chlorocatechol metabolism (Pathways 2 and 3), where enzymes
from the modiﬁed ortho-cleavage pathway (Pathway 1) were
not detected. The missing/partial degradation pathways were
completed through a gap-ﬁlling procedure (Figure 1). Here,
the possibility of the presence of the ortho-cleavage pathway
and meta-cleavage pathway along with the existing modiﬁed
ortho-cleavage pathway is proposed based on genome data.
The presence of partial Pathways 2 and 3 indicates that SRS
16 might be using these pathways for linuron mineralization
under diﬀerent conditions. Simulations in the SRS 16 model with
complete Pathways 2 and 3 provided similar results to those
obtained with Pathway 1 for most of the supplements (such
as glutamine, asparagine, and aniline), with some exceptions
such as methionine.
In the present study, it is shown that reconstruction is
important for the study of bacterial physiology, allowing
the simulation of degradation outcomes considering multiple
conditions. It is well known that the degradation process is
inﬂuenced by various physicochemical and nutritional factors
(Kanissery and Sims, 2011). The availability of carbon and
nitrogen sources (nutrients) signiﬁcantly aﬀects the eﬃciency
of degradation (Y assir et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2011). Here,
simulations suggest the importance of speciﬁc supplements to
increase the degradation rate. Simulations predicted variations
in the enhancement potential of diﬀerent supplements, further
supported by experimental validation. As a single cell is a
complex network of reactions and metabolites, supplements can
have a variable eﬀect associated with the activation of diﬀerent
sets of reactions under each media condition. Integration of
model predictions with omics data is useful for revealing the
metabolic shifts in the microbial cell (Alam et al., 2010). To
date, several strategies have been adopted in order to accelerate
the biodegradation of herbicides in the environment, ranging
from optimizing media to constructing transgenics (Azab et al.,
2018; Li et al., 2020). Genome-scale modeling approaches along
with omics technology have established their importance in
biotechnology and medicine (Zhang and Hua, 2016). They are
continuously appreciated for their role in the degradation of
pollutants (Faust, 2019; Xu et al., 2019; Cardozo et al., 2020)
and in other environmental problems related to agricultural
soils (Mazzola and Freilich, 2017). Recently, Ofaim et al. (2020)demonstrated the use of genome-scale modeling for optimizing
atrazine degradation by P. aurescens TC1. The current
study demonstrated that genome-scale modeling allows
the optimization of microbial activity, leading to herbicide
biodegradation. The integration of predictive biology helped to
screen the eﬀect of the higher number of supplements on the
degradation by SRS 16. Such supplement-derived amendment
might reﬂect exchanges in the indigenous community where the
degrader can be supported by non-degrader species (Xu et al.,
2019) and accelerate the degradation rate.
In this way, computational biology can reduce cost, time, and
eﬀort (mainly related to gene manipulation) and save resources
to identify the optimal solutions for a speciﬁc phenomenon. The
association of genome-scale metabolic models with the omics
approach can help to unravel the hidden facts of metabolism
(Massaiu et al., 2019). Thus, there is a strong possibility of
improvement in degradation processes through the contribution
of modeling as an environmental biotechnology approach.
