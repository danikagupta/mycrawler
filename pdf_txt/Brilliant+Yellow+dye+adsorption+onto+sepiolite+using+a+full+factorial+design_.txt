Abstract:  This research work involved using  factorial experimental design technique s to investigate 
the adsorption of hexavalent chromium from an aqueous solution on medlar activated carbon. A 24 full 
factorial experimental design was employed to determine the optimum values and degree of importance 
of parameters: pH, initial Cr (VI) conc entration, adsorbent dose , and contact time at two levels. The 
optimized conditions for hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) removal w ere at initial pH 1.5, 5 mg.L−1Cr (VI), 
adsorbent dose 6 mg , and 60 min adsorption time. The results predicted a good agreement bet ween the 
predicted values (R2= 0.9909), as obtained by the model, and the experimental value (R2= 0.9977).  The 
main effects and interaction effects were analyzed using analysis of variance  (ANOVA), F -test and P -
values to define the most important process  variables affecting Cr (VI) adsorption. The most significant 
variables were therefore the pH of the solution and the adsorbent dose . Therefore, the present results 
demonstrate that medlar activated carbon should be regarded as a low -cost alternative for  removing  Cr 
(VI) from an aqueous solution.  The adsorption data were evaluated by Langmuir, Freundlich , and 
Dubinin -Radushkevich isotherms. The results showed that the Langmuir isotherm model best describes 
the equilibrium adsorption  with a high co rrelatio n coefficient .

1. Introduction  
Pollution by heavy metals is considered a serious threat to the environment and 
especially to human health. Rapid industrialization has led to an increase in the removal of 
heavy metals from the environment. Hence , effluent treatment is one of the most imp ortant 
industry tasks  due to their toxic nature and accumulation through the food chain as non -
biodegradable pollutants. The most familiar heavy metals pollutants are chromium, lead, 
cadmium, copper, and mercury. Among them, chromium, one of the top -priori ty toxic heavy 
metal s in wastewater, has been widely used in various industrial processes, such as petroleum 
refining, battery, metallurgy, electroplating, tanning, textile , and manufacturing of dye and 
metal corrosion inhibition [1 -3]. Chromium exists in two stable oxidation states, trivalent 
chromium Cr (III) and hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) forms.  
https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.12471262   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  1248  The hexavalent Cr (VI) is generally considered more toxic than the trivalent Cr (III) 
form because it is very soluble and can be easily absorbed and accumulate d in the body, 
especially in kidneys, liver and even cause lung cancer [4, 5]. For this reason, Cr (VI) is 
considered a priority hazardous pollutant. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 
recommendation for drinking water recommendations, the ma ximum allowable level for total 
chromium is 0.05 mg / L [6].            
Various traditional methods are applied for the removal of environmental pollution. 
Especially, the contamination of water by toxic heavy metal ions is a global  environmental 
problem. A dsorption is an alternative method suitable for the treatment of wastewater. Its 
comparative advantage over other treatment techniques includes the availability of adsorbent, 
low treatment cost, high efficiency , and simpl icity to operate for removing trace -levels metal 
ions from aqueous systems. Numerous studies reported the removal of Cr (VI) using different 
adsorbents such as activated carbon [7 –9], sugar cane pulp residue [10], waste t ires [11] , and 
rice husk ash [12]. Activated carbons , because of their  high surface area, microporous 
character , and the chemical nature of their surface , have been considered potential adsorbents 
to remove  heavy metals from industrial effluents [13].  
The application of statistical experimental design techniques in adsorpti on process 
development can improve product yields and reduce  process variability, development time , and 
overall costs [14,  15]. In this context, the main objective of this work was to optimize the 
adsorption of Cr (VI) from aqueous solution onto medlar act ivated carbon using full factorial 
design (FFD) and determine the adsorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics studies.  
2. Materials and Methods  
2.1. Preparation of medlar activated carbon . 
The medlar was collected from the region of Safi in Morocco and washed with distilled 
water for removing dirt and other foreign particles. After the drying process, Chemical 
activation of the medlar precursor was done with H 3PO 4 (2.5M) mixed with distilled  water and 
completed by carbonization at temperature 500°C for 3 hours producing a medlar activated 
carbon. The medlar activated carbon product was r epeatedly rinsed  several times with distilled 
water until clearness and neutral pH and then dried at 105°C for about 12 h. The activated 
carbon is abbreviated as “MAC” throughout the manuscript.  
2.2. Characterization of medlar activated carbon.  
Fourier Transform Infra -Red spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope 
(SEM) analysis were applied in order to identify the presence of functional groups and to 
characterize the surface morphology of MAC adsorbent by using FTIR spectroscope  (Perkin 
Elmer model) and with HITACHI -S4100 equipment operated at 20  kV, respectively.  
2.3. Batch adsorption experiments.  
A stock solution of Cr (VI) was prepared (1000 mg/L) by dissolving 2.828 g of 
potassium dichromate (K 2Cr2O7) in double -distilled water and diluting to obtain desired 
concentration ranging from 1 to 6 mg/L. All the other chemicals used in the study were of 
analytical grade. The initial pH was adjusted with the addition of 0.1 mol L−1 solutions of 
NaOH or HCl to the desired values using a pH -Meter HANNA 5222.  https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.12471262   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  1249  Batch experiments based on the full factorial design (FFD) were conducted at random 
to study the effe ct of the pre -selected four operating variables on the Cr (VI) removal efficiency 
of the medlar activated carbon (MAC). For adsorption efficiency optimization, the experiments 
were conducted at different pH (1.5 – 9), initial Cr (VI) concentration (1 –5 mg/ L), and 
adsorbent dose (1 – 6 mg) with contact time varying from 30 – 60 min at a constant agitation 
speed of 600 rpm. Total hexavalent chromium concentration was measured by a 
spectrophotometer (Jenway 6300). The pink complex formed from 1.5 -diphenyl carba zide 
prepared in acetone and Cr (VI) in acidic solution was a nalyzed  at 540 nm [16].  
The percentage removal (%) and amount of adsorption at equilibrium qe (mg/g) of Cr 
(VI) were calculated using the equations (1) and (2) , respectively:

2.4. Statistical analysis . 
The e xperimental design is an essential tool for studying the individual and interaction 
effects of all parameters simultaneously [16,  17]. A factorial design is applicable for 
optimization of the main effects of  variables , and their interactions are compared with one 
another in order to estimate the influence of the different variables and employed to reduce the 
total number of experiments to achieve the best overall optimization of the process [18 -21]. A 
common experimental design is one with all input factors set at two  levels each. These levels 
are called ‘high (+1)’ and ‘low (−1)’ , respectively. If there are k factors each at two  levels, a 
full factorial design has 2k runs.  
3. Results and Discussion  
3.1. Characterization of MAC adsorbent.  
The FTIR spectrum obtained for the medlar activated carbon as shown in Figure 1(a), 
the band located between 3200 and 3600 cm-1was attributed to the amine (N -H) and hydroxyl 
groups (O -H) (phenols, carboxyl , or alcohols) [22].  The bands at 2929 and 2852 cm-1 are 
arising from aliphatic C H stretching. The peak appearing on the spectrum range of 1400 -1600 
cm-1 is typically attributed to vibrations of the C=C bonds in the aromatic rings or the groups 
C-O of alc ool or ether or hydroxyl group [23,  24]. These functional groups were attributed to 
the existence of cellulose and hemicelluloses bending in  the structure of medlar activated 
carbon, which made the Cr (VI) removal feasible. The SEM micrograph was prepared and is 
presented in Figure 1(b). It can be seen from the micrographs that the surface of medlar 
activated carbon has a highly porous structure with greater heterogeneity.  
3.2. Design of experiments by FFD . 
In this study, a full factorial design experiment was employed to analyze  adsorption of 
hexavalent chromium Cr (VI). Table 1 illustrates the 4 factors used including, pH (A), initial 
Cr(VI) concentration (B), adsorbent dose (C), and contact time (D).  By using 24 full factorial 
design s, a total of 16 expe rimental runs were performed. Input factor levels were −1 (low level) 
and +1 (high level), which indicates the lowest range of factors and the highest range of factors , https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.12471262   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  1250  respectively. The results were analyzed using  the software Design Expert 11. The main effects 
and interactions effects of varied factors were determined.

The general form of the codified equation with four factors model is as follows:  
R (%) =  X0+X1 A + X2 B + X3 C + X4 D + X5 AB + X6 AC + X7 AD + X8 BC + X9 BD + 
X10 CD + X11 ABC + X12 ABD + X13 ACD + X14 BCD + X15 ABCD                                                                  
(3)                                                               
Where R (%) is the percentage removal of Cr (VI), X 0 is the global mean, Xi represents the 
other regression coefficients , and A, B, C, and D stands for pH, initial concentration of Cr (VI), 
amount of adsorbent and contact time, respectively. By substitut ing the coefficients X 0 and xi 
in Eq. (3) by their values , we get:  
Cr (VI) removal (%)  = 54.42 – 12.82 A – 0.14 B + 12.08 C + 2.50 D + 1.77 AB + 0.78 AC -

sign indicates an antagonistic effect [16]. The removal efficiencies (%) of Cr (VI) have been 
predicted by Figure 2 and are presented in Table 2. In general, there were agreements between 
the experimental and predicted values of Cr (VI) removal efficiency.

3.2.1. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) . 
The quality of the model was validated using the analysis of variance method 
(ANOVA). The sum of squares (SS) and mean square (MS) of each factor ed P-value  and P -
value were  determined by choosing an  α risk of 5%. P -value is the probability value that is 
used to determine the statistically significant effects in the model [25 -27]. 
The variance analysis  for Cr (VI) removal by the FFD model is tabulated in Table 3.  
The main effects and interaction effects of each factor having a P-value < 0.05 are considered 
as potentially significant, and a value that>0.1 indicate s the model term is not significant. The 
values of “Probability >F” less than 0.05 indicated that model terms viz. A, C, D, AB, AC, AD , 
and ABC were significant. The regression analysis produced the following equation with R2 
of 0.9982 and p<0.0001 to remove  Cr (VI).  
After discarding insignifica nt terms, the resultant models can be represented as:  
Cr (VI) removal (%)  = 54.42 -12.82 A+ 12.08 C +2.50 D +1.77 AB +0.78 AC -1.01AD –

 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  1252  The linear correlation (R2), which was used to evaluate the correlation between the 
actual and predicted responses , was obtained from the developed model to be 0.9967  [28]. This 
demonstrates that 99.67% of the variation for percentage removal of Cr (VI) is described by 
the variables studied and indicated  only 0.33%. On the other hand, the coefficient of variation 
(CV) is not greater than 10%, so the model can be considered reasonable as the CV is the ratio 
of the standard error of estimate to the mean value of the observed response [2 9]. The CV also 
is a measure of the reproducibility of the model [30]. So, the observed 2.10% indicated high 
precision and reliability of the experimental design. The “Predicted R2” of 0.9929 was found 
to be in reasonable agreement with “Adjusted R2” of 0. 9967. It was also noticed that the 
Adequate Precision (AP) measured the signal -to-noise ratio. A ratio greater than 4 was 
desirable. The adequate precision (AP) of 84.898 indicates adequate model discrimination [31] 
demonstrate s the process's significance . 
3.2.2. Main and interaction effects . 
The main effects of each parameter on the Cr (VI) removal efficiency (%) is shown in 
Figure. 3. The main effects represent variations of the average between the high and low levels 
for each factor. The sign of the main effect indicates the directions of the effect. It can be seen 
from Figure 3.  The effect of pH (A) was characteri zed by a greater degree of departure and 
also had a negative effect on the response, whereas the adsorbent dose (C) of MAC has a 
negative effect on the response with greater departure.  
The interaction effect is effective when the change in the response fro m low to high 
levels of a factor is dependent on the level of a second factor , as shown in Figure 4. If the lines 
of two factors are superimposed and parallel, indicating that the factors' effect  is not significant. 
In contrast, when the lines are not para llel, the two factors interact together. From Figure 4 the 
interaction between AB, AC, AD , and ABC is significant ; in contrast , BC, BD, DC is not 
significant.  
To better understand  the relationship between factors and a response, a cube plot was 
carried out  (Figure 5). The cube plot indicates that decreasing pH from 9 to 1.5 enhances the 
Cr (VI) removal efficiency significantl y by 34.44% (from 49.28 to 83.72%) at higher 
concentration (5mg/L), while at low concentration (1mg/L), changes in pH do not have a 
greater effect (a decrease of only 9.76%).

3.2.3. 3D surfaces, contour and perturbation plots.  
To assess the effects of variables, the 3D surfaces, 2D contour , and perturbation plots 
are demonstrated for a function of two factors. This representation shows the r elative effects 
of any two variables when the remaining variables are kept constant  in analyzing Figure. 6A , 
we see that the adsorption performance increases from 49.28 to 83.72% when the pH decreases 
and the initial concentration of the adsorbate increase s. Figure 6B shows that the Cr (VI) 
removal efficiency (%) increased with decreasing pH from 9 to 1.5 and increasing the  adsorbent 
dose from 1 mg to 6 mg.  Cr (VI) maximal removal efficiency  is observed at 5 mg/L and 60 
min for concentration and contact ti me, respectively. Finally, the effect of interaction between 
pH and contact time is shown in Figure 6C. The plot revealed that the percentage of Cr (VI) 
removal increased with a decrease in pH and increase contact time.  
Contour plots for the significant interactions were shown in Figure 6(A) (B) and (C).  
The interaction plots showed that interaction of pH and Cr (VI) concentration played a major 
https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.12471262   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  1254  role. These two factors also  interacted strongly with other factors indicating predominant 
influenc e in removal. Interactions of pH and Cr (VI) concentration with adsorbent dose were 
significant on the response. This is probably because  better mass transfer occurred from 
aqueous medium to solid adsorbent [32]. Almost similar results were reported in the  earlier 
work [33 -35].

C (VI) concentration, (B) pH and adsorbent dose, (C) Cr (VI) concentration and contact time on Cr (VI) 
removal (%).  
https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.12471262   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  1255  Another convenient effect of variables on responses is the use of perturbation plots. The 
perturbation plot (Figure 7) of the four independent factors in response surface models shows 
how the response changes as each factor change from the cho sen reference point, while the 
other factors are held constant at a reference value. In this case, at the center point, factor A 
(pH) and C (adsorbent dose) provide a relatively high effect on Cr (VI) percentage removal as 
it changes from the reference poi nt. The higher amount of adsorbent dose and pH  lead to higher 
removal (%) of Cr (VI). Factors B and D ha ve the same effect as factors A and C , but it can be 
concluded that term B and D has less effect than term A and C.

time.  
3.2.4. Normal probability plot .  
A normal probability plot is applied to judge the normality of data as “real” or “chance” 
[36-38]. The model's adequacy  was evaluated using a diagnostic plot (normal % probability 
versus studentized residuals and studentized residuals versus run number) , which is presented 
in Figure s 8a and 8b. In Figure 8a, the points are spread almost on a straight line along the 
diagona l for both cases . This trend shows that the error terms are normally dispersed and 
independent of each other. Also, it was observed in Figure 8b that the points are randomly 
scattered surrounding zero on the studentized residuals axis in between +4.5 and−4.5 in both 
the cases, which indicates homoscedasticity and establishing the adequacy of the respective 
model.

 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  1256  3.2.5. Optimization and validation of result . 
Maximum Cr (VI) removal efficiency was found to be 85.92%. Howev er, the present 
investigation was carried out to find the optimum process conditions through FFD for the 
highest desirability. The desirability of an experience with a value close to unity is considered 
the best condition . To obtain the optimal condition f or Cr (VI) removal with adsorption process,  
pH at the minimum level, the initial concentration at the maximum level, adsorbent dosage at 
the maximum level , and contact time in a range were set for maximum desirability (Figure 9). 
After setting the above conditions, the optimum conditions were given by the statistical 
software [39]. The best local maximum removal was found to be at initial pH of 1.5, Cr (VI) 
concentration of 5 mg/L, the adsorbent dosage of 6 mg/50 mL , and contact time 60 min with 
Cr (VI) removal of 85.91% and desirability of 0.991 (Figure 9).

3.3. Adsorption kinetics . 
Adsor ption kinetics were used to examine the adsorption mechanism such as chemical 
reaction, diffusion control , or mass transfer coefficient by the various models, namely pseudo -
first-order, pseudo -second -order intraparticle diffusion model, respectively. The l inearized 
forms of these models are represented below [40 -42]:

Where q e is the theoretically adsorbed amount at equilibrium (mg/g), q t is the amount adsorbed 
at any time (t) (mg/g), k 1(min)is the calculated pseudo -first-order rate constant, k 2 is the 
calculated pseudo -second -order rate constant (g/mg.min),  Kid (mg/g.min1/2) is the intraparticle 
diffusion rate constant, C i is the intercept which indicates the boundary layer thickness [43,  44]. 
Based on the parameters of these models are given in Tabl e 4. The kinetic data obtained 
were tested based on the determination coefficient (R2) and equilibrium adsorption capacity 
(qe). From Table 4, it was noticed that R2 for the pseudo -second -order study was higher (close 
to unity) than that of pseudo -first-order and intraparticle diffusion models, the experimental q e 
values (q e,exp) are in good agreement with the calculated q e value (q e,cal) for the pseudo -second -
order model indicated a better fit than the pseudo -first-order model and intraparticle diffusion 
models. Further confirming chemisorptions of the Cr (VI) adsorption mechanism [45].

3.4. Equilibrium study . 
An e quilibrium study was investigated using the Langmuir, Freundlich , and Dubinin 
Radushkevich isotherms. The linearized forms of these models are expressed by the following 
equations [46 -48]:

Where q e is the equilibrium capacity at equilibrium, concentration C e, qm is the Langmuir 
constant representing maximum monolayer adsorption capacity, and K L is the Langmuir 
constant related to adsorption's free energy , K f and n are constants affecting the adsorption 
capacity and intensity of adsorption, respectively. B is a constant that gives an idea about the 
mean free energy of adsorption per mole of the adsorbate, q m is the maximum adsorption 
capacity, and ε is the polanyi potential.  
The experimental isotherm parameters were conducted at four different temperature s 
(298 K, 308 K, 318 K , and 328 K) , and initial Cr (VI) concentrations of 1 to 6 mg/L with 
constant pH (1.5) are listed in Table 5.

 The table indicates that the maximum adsorbed capacity (q max) increases as the process 
temperature rises. These results demonstrate that adsorption on MAC is favorable by increasing 
the energy (endothermic process). The high R2 (0.997) and q max values suggested that the 
Langmuir isotherm describes the adsorption process well compared to the Freundlich model https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.12471262   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  1258  and Dubinin -Radushkevich models at the different temperatures, respectively. The Langmuir 
isotherm model indicates the formation of monolayer su rface adsorption of Cr (VI) ions on the 
specific homogeneous sites . Moreover, the monolayer adsorption capacity of MAC adsorbent 
was found to be 64.94 mg/g and was considerably high in comparison with the value of the 
other adsorbents of Cr (VI) removal re ported in the literature (see Table 6).  
The magnitude of E (kJ·mol−1) is used for estimating the type of adsorption mechanism. 
Suppose this value is between 8 and 16 kJ·mol−1. In that case, the adsorption process is 
controlled by a chemical mechanism. In contrast,  for E less than 8 kJ·mol−1, the adsorption 
process proceeds through a physical mechanism [56]. The calculated values of E (Table 5) 
suggested that Cr (VI) adsorption  occurs via physical adsorption.  
3.5. Thermodynamics of the adsorption process.  
To observe the influence of temperature at different Cr (VI) concentration and to 
determine the spontaneity, stability , and thermal behavior of the process Cr (VI) adsorption, 
the change in free energy (ΔG0), enthalpy (ΔH0), and entropy (ΔS0) were estimated using 
following equations.  
                    ∆G°=∆H°−T ∆S°                                                                                              (12)

Where ‘T’ is the solution temperature (K) and R is the universal gas constan t (8.314 J/mol.K) 
and K d is the coefficient of distribution given by [56]:  
                  Kd=qe
𝐜𝐞                                                                                                                  (14) 
The thermodynamic results calculated for the Cr (VI) adsorption are presented in Table 
7. The negative values of ΔG0 suggest the adsorption process is thermodynamically feasible 
and spo ntaneous. At the same time,  the positive value of ΔS0 demonstrates the increased 
randomness at the solution interface during Cr (VI) adsorption . The positive value of ΔH0 for 
this study confirms that the interaction between Cr (VI) ion and MAC adsorbent su rface is 
endothermic.

4. Conclusions  
 As a result of this study, the full factorial experimental design was applied to optimize 
the hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) removal efficiency by MAC and to determine the main and 
interactive effects of four various factors like pH, Cr (VI) concentration, adsorbent dosage and 
contact time on the adsorption of Cr (VI) by the medlar activated carbon. The main conclusions 
that can be drawn from this work are given below, Main effects like pH (A), adsorbent dose https://doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC 121.12471262   
 https://biointerfaceresearch.com/  1259  (C), and contact time (D) were sig nificant , and the interaction effect between pH Concentration 
(AB), pH adsorbent dose (AC), pH contact time (AD) and pH concentration adsorbent dose 
(ABC) was the most influencing interaction. The k inetics study was followed by the pseudo -
second -order kine tic model, whereas equilibrium isotherm data were best interpreted by the 
Langmuir isotherm model with a high maximum adsorption capacity of 64.94 mg/g and high 
correlation coefficient (R2= 0.997). Thermodynamic parameters indicate that adsorption of Cr 
(VI) was exothermic, spontaneous , and physisorption process.
