1. Introduction  
The residual dyes from different sources (e.g., textile industries, paper and pulp industries, 
dye and dye intermediates industries, phar maceutical industries, tannery, and Kraft 
bleaching industries, etc.) are considered a wide variety of organic pollutants introduced 
into the natural water resources or  wastewater treatment systems.  
One of the main sources with severe pollution  problems worldwide is the textile industry 
and its dye-containing wastewaters (i.e. 10, 000 different textile dyes with an estimated 
annual production of 7.105 metric tonnes are commercially available worldwide; 30% of 
these dyes are used in excess of 1,000 tonnes pe r annum, and 90% of the textile products are 
used at the level of 100 tonnes per annum or less ) (Baban et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2001; 
Soloman et al., 2009). 10-25% of textile dyes are lost during the dyei ng process, and 2-20% 
are directly discharged as aqueous effluents in different environmental components.  
In particular, the discharge of dye-containing effluents into the water environment is 
undesirable, not only because of their colour, but also because many of dyes released and 
their breakdown products are toxic, carcinogen ic or mutagenic to life forms mainly because 
of carcinogens, such as benzidine, naphthalen e and other aromatic compounds (Suteu et al., 
2009; Zaharia et al., 2009). Without adequate treatment these dyes can remain in the 
environment for a long period of  time. For instance, the half-life of hydrolysed Reactive Blue 
19 is about 46 years at pH 7 and 25°C (Hao et al., 2000).  
In addition to the aforementioned problems, th e textile industry consumes large amounts of 
potable and industrial water (Tables 1, 2 and Fig. 1) as processing water (90-94%) and a 
relatively low percentage as cooling water (6-10%) (in comparison with the chemical 
industry where only 20% is used  as process water and the rest for cooling). The recycling of 
treated wastewater has been recommended due to the high levels of contamination in 
dyeing and finishing processes (i.e. dyes and their breakdown products, pigments, dye 
intermediates, auxiliary chemicals and heavy metals, etc.) (Tables 3, 4 and 5) (adapted from 
Bertea A. and Bertea A.P., 20 08; Bisschops and Spanjers, 2003; Correia et al., 1994; Orhon et 
al., 2001).

The most common textile processing technology consists of desizing, scouring, bleaching, 
mercerizing and dyeing processes (EPA, 1997): 
• Sizing  is the first preparation step, in which si zing agents such as  starch, polyvinyl 
alcohol (PVA) and carboxymethyl cellulose are added to provide strength to the fibres 
and minimize breakage.  
• Desizing  is used to remove sizing materials prior to weaving. 
• Scouring  removes impurities from the fibres by using alkali solution (commonly sodium 
hydroxide) to breakdown natural oils, fats, waxes and surfactants, as well as to emulsify 
and suspend impurities in the scouring bath. 
• Bleaching  is the step used to remove unwanted  c o l o u r  f r o m  t h e  f i b e r s  b y  u s i n g  
chemicals such as sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide.  
• Mercerising  is a continuous chemical process used to increase dye-ability, lustre and 
fibre appearance. In this step a concentrated  alkaline solution is applied and an acid 
solution washes the fibres before the dyeing step.  
• Dyeing  is the process of adding colour to the fibres, which normally requires large 
volumes of water not only in th e dye bath, but also during the rinsing step . Depending 
on the dyeing process, many ch emicals like metals, salts, surfactants, organic processing 
aids, sulphide and formaldehyde, may be added to improve dye adsorption onto the 
fibres. 
In general, the textile industry uses a large quantity of chemicals such as:  
• Detergents and caustic , which are used to remove dirt, grit, oils, and waxes. Bleaching is 
used to improve whiten ess and brightness.  
• Sizing agents , which are added to improve weaving.  
• Oils, which are added to improv e spinning and knitting.  
• Latex and glues , which are used as binders.  
• Dyes, fixing agents, and many in-organics , which are used to provide the brilliant array of 
colours the market demands.  
• A wide variety of special chemicals , which are used such as soft eners, stain release agents, 
and wetting agents.  
Many of these chemicals become part of th e final product whereas the rest are removed 
from the fabric, and are purged  in the textile effluent.

The annual estimated load with pollutants of a textile wastewater is of: 200,000-250,000 t 
salts; 50,000-100,000 t impurities of natural fi bres (including biocids) and associated 
materials (lignin, sericine, et c.); 80,000-100,000 t blinding agen ts (especially starch and its 
derivatives, but also polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cel lulose); 25,000-

30,000 t preparation agents (in principal, mine ral oils); 20,000-25,000 t tensides (dispersing 
agents, emulsifiers, detergen ts and wetting agents); 15,000- 20,000 tonnes carboxylic acids 
(especially acetic acid); 10,000-15,000 t bind ers; 5,000-10,000 t urea; 5,000-10,000 t ligands, 
and < 5,000 t auxiliaries (EWA, 2005). The enviro nmental authorities have begun to target 
the textile industry to clean up the wastewat er that is discharged. The principal quality 
indicators that regulators are looking for polluting effect or toxicity are the high salt content, 
high Total Solids (TS), high Total Dissolved  Solids (TDS), high Total Suspended Solids 
(TSS), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), heavy 
metals, colour of the textile effluent (ADMI color value - American Dye Manufacturer 
Institute color value), and other potential hazardous or dangerou s organic compounds 
included into each textile processing  technological steps (Tables 4 and 5).

Table 5. Principal characteristics of a cott on wet processing wastewater (Cooper, 1995) 
The wastewater composition is depending on the different organic-based compounds, 
inorganic chemicals and dyes us ed in the industrial dry and wet-processing steps. Textile 
effluents from the dyeing and rinsing steps repr esent the most coloured fraction of textile 
wastewaters, and are characterize d by extreme fluctuations in many quality indicators such 
as COD, BOD, pH, colour, salinity and temperature.  
The colour of textile wastewater is mainly du e to the presence of textile dyes, pigments and 
other coloured compounds. A single dyeing operation can use a number of dyes from 
different chemical classes resulting in a complex wastewater (Correia et al., 1994). Moreover, 
the textile dyes have complex structures, synthetic origin and recalcitrant nature, which 
makes them obligatory to remove from indust rial effluents before being disposed into 
hydrological systems (Anjaneyulu et al, 2005).  
The dye removal from textile effluent is always connected with the decolourization 
treatment applied for textile wastewater in te rms of respectation the local environmental 
quality requirements and standards (Table 6) (i.e. removal values of COD, BOD, TS, TSS, 
TDS, colour, total nitrogen, an d total phosphorus from textile  wastewater higher than 70-

limits) (Zaharia, 2008). 
The decolorization treatments applied for differ ent textile effluents include current and also 
advanced non-biological (i.e. specific mechano-physical, chemical, electrochemical process-
es, etc.) and also biological pr ocesses (Suteu et al., 2009; Zaha ria, 2006; Zaharia et al, 2011).

Studies on the behavior of textile organic dyes in water and wastewater treatment 
processes refer predominantly to laboratory tests or investigations of se mi-technical 
plants, sometimes under conditions related to waterworks practice. In  addition, textile 
operators, water supply companies, local environmental authorities have coll ected a lot of 
data on the behavior of textile dyes during textile wastewater treatment, but have seldom 
published their results.  
However, information on the behavior of textile  organic dyes is needed, because the limited 
number of reports available that are based on realistic operating conditions or which 
reproduce practical conditions that  are already several years old. 
2. Textile organic dyes – Classification and characteri stics 
The dyes are natural and synthetic compounds that make the world more beautiful through 
coloured products. The textile dyes represent a category of organic compounds, generally 
considered as pollutants, presented into wast ewaters resulting mainly from processes of 
chemical textile finishing (Suteu et  al., 2011a; Zaharia et al., 2009).  
The textile coloration industry is characte rised by a very large number of dispersed 
dyehouses of small and medium  size that use a very wide range of textile dyes.

2.1 Textile organic dye classification 
The nature and origin are firstly considered as  criteria for the general classification in 
natural and synthetic textile dyes. 
The natural textile dyes were mainly used in textile processing until 1856, beginning in 2600 
BC when was mentioned the use of dyestuff in China, based on dyes extracted from 
vegetable and animal resources. It is also kn own that Phoenicians were used Tyrian purple 
produced from certain species of crushed sea sn ails in the 15th century BC, and indigo dye 
produced from the well-known indigo plant since 3000 BC. The dyes from madder plants 
were used for wrapping and dyeing of Egyptian mummies clothes and also of Incas fine 
textures in South America.  
The synthetic dyes were firstly discovered in  1856, beginning with ‚mauve‘ dye (aniline), 
a brilliant fuchsia colour synthesed by W.H. Perkin (UK), and some azo dyes synthesed by 
diazotisation reaction discovered in 1958 by  P. Gries (Germany) (Welham, 2000). These 
dyes are aromatic compounds produced by chemical synthesis, and having into  their 
structure aromatic rings that contain delocated electrons and also different functional 
groups. Their color is due to the chromo gene-chromophore structure (acceptor of 
electrons), and the dyeing capacity is due to auxochrome groups (don or of electrons). The 
chromogene is constituted from an aromat ic structure normally based on rings of 
benzene, naphthaline or antracene, from which are binding chromofores that contain 
double conjugated links with delocated electrons. The chromofore config urations are 
represented by the azo group (-N=N-), ethylene group (=C=C=), methine group (-CH=), 
carbonyl group (=C=O), carbon-nitrogen (=C=NH; -CH=N-), carbon-sulphur (=C=S; ≡C-
S-S-C ≡), nitro (-NO 2; -NO-OH), nitrozo (-N=O; =N-OH) or chinoid groups. The 
auxochrome groups are ionizable groups, that  confer to the dyes the binding capacity 
onto the textile material. The usual auxochrome groups are: -NH 2 (amino), -COOH 
(carboxyl), -SO 3H (sulphonate) and -OH (hydroxyl) (Suteu et al, 2011; Welham, 2000). Five 
examples of textile dyes are presented in Fig. 2. 
The textile dyes are mainly classified in tw o different ways: (1) based on its application 
characteristics (i.e. CI Generic Name such as ac id, basic, direct, disperse, mordant, reactive, 
sulphur dye, pigment, vat, azo insoluble), and (2) based on its chemical structure 
respectively (i.e. CI Constitution Number such  as nitro, azo, carote noid, diphenylmethane, 
xanthene, acridine, quinoline, indamine , sulphur, amino- and hydroxy ketone, 
anthraquinone, indigoid, phthalocyanine, inorganic pigment, etc.) (Tables 7 and 8). 
Excepting the colorant precursors such as azoic component, oxidation bases and sulphur 
dyes, almost two-third of all organic dyes are azo dyes (R 1-N=N-R 2) u sed in  a n u m ber of 
different industrial processes such as textile  dyeing and printing, colour photography, 
finishing processing of leather, pharmaceutical , cosmetics, etc. The starting material or 
intermediates for dye production are aniline, chloroanilines, naphthylamines, 
methylanilines, benzidines, phen ylenediamines, and others.  
Considering only the general structure, the textile dyes are also classified in anionic, 
nonionic and cationic dyes. The major anionic dyes are the direct, acid and reactive dyes 
(Robinson et al., 2001), and the most problema tic ones are the brig htly coloured, water 
soluble reactive and acid dyes (they can no t be removed through co nventional treatment 
systems). 
The major nonionic dyes are disperse dyes that does not ionised in the aqueous 
environment, and the major cationic dyes ar e the azo basic, anthraquinone disperse and

and Separation/Elimination Procedures from I ndustrial Effluents – A Critical Overview 
 61 
reactive dyes, etc. The most problematic dyes are those which are made from known 
carcinogens such as benzidine and other ar omatic compounds (i.e. anthroquinone-based 
dyes are resistant to degradation due to their fused aromatic ring structure). Some disperse 
dyes have good ability to bioaccumulation, an d the azo and nitro compounds are reduced in 
sediments, other dye-accumulating substrates to toxic amines (e.g. R 1-N=N-R 2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 
R1-NH 2 + R 2-NH 2). 
The organic dyes used in the textile dyeing  process must have a high chemical and 
photolytic stability, and the conventional text ile effluent treatment in aerobic conditions 
does not degrade these textile dyes, and are pr esented in high quantities into the natural 
water resources in absence of some tertiary treatments.

The major textile dyes can be included in th e two high classes: azo or anthraquinone (65-
75% from total textile dyes). The azo dyes are characterised by reactive groups that form 
covalent bonds with HO-, HN-, or HS- groups in fibres (cotton, wool, silk, nylon). Azo dyes 
are mostly used for yellow, orange and red colours. Anthraquinone dyes constitute the 
second most important class of textile dyes, after azo dyes, and have a wide range of colours 
in almost the whole visible spectrum, but they  are most commonly used for violet, blue and 
green colours (Fontenot et al., 2003). Considering the nature of textile fibres that are dyeing, 
the textile dyes can be classified as into Table 9.

Table 9. Dye classes and dyeing textile substrates  (adapted from Bertea A. & Bertea A.P., 2008) 
The textile dyeing process is du e to physico-chemical interactions developed at contacting of 
textile material with dye solution or dispersion, which contains a large variety of chemicals 
(salts, acids) and dyeing auxiliaries (tensides, dispersing agents, etc.).  
2.2 Textile dye characterisation 
The identification of individu al unknown dyes in a coloured  effluent or watercourse is 
difficult to be done and implies advanced analytical methods (i.e . individual and/or 
coupled spectrophotometry, G/L chromatograp hy and mass spectromet ry procedures), and 
also the colour determination and apprecia tion in different operating situations. 
The characterisation and identification data of the textile dyes as main chemicals in dyeing 
process must consist of: 
• dye identity data (i.e. name, C.I. or CAS number, molecular and structural formula; 
composition, degree of purity, spectral data ; methods of detection and determination) 
(e.g., some examples illustrated in Fig. 2), 
• dye production information (i.e. produc tion process, proposed uses, form, 
concentration in commercially availabl e preparations, estimated production, 
recommended methods and precautions concerni ng handling, storage, transport, fire 
and other dangers, emergency measures, et c.) (e.g. some indications in Table 3), 
• dye physico-chemical properties (i.e. boil ing point (b.p.), relative density, water 
solubility, partition coefficient, vapour pressure, self-ignition, oxidising properties, 
granulometry, particle size distribution, etc.) (e.g., for the first synthetic discovered dye: 
Aniline – 184 (b.p.), k H= 2.05E-01, C satw= 3.6E+04, pK a= 4.6, log K ow= 0.90; for 4,4’-

• toxicological studies (i.e. acute toxicity-oral, inhalation, dermal, skin or eyes irritation, 
skin sensitisation, repeated dose toxicity-28 days, mutagenicity, toxicity to 
reproduction, toxicokinetic behaviour), 
• ecotoxicological studies (i.e. acute toxicity to  fish, daphnia, growth inhibition on algae, 
bacteriological inhibition, degradation: ready biodegradability, abiotic degradation-
hydrolysis as a function of pH, BOD, COD, BOD/COD ratio). 
These characteristics and indentification data are given obligatory by the dye producers or 
distributors of textile products on the free ma rket of homologated colorants, and also exist 
in the library data of some operating pr ograms of advanced analysis apparatus. 
The textile azo dyes are characterized by relatively high polarity (log K ow up to 3) and high 
recalcitrance. Recalcitrance is difficult to evaluate because of the dependence of degradation 
on highly variable boundary conditions (e.g., redox milieu or pH). For example, aniline (the 
first synthetic discovered dye) is known to be easily degradable, but under specific anoxic 
conditions it has been proven to be easily stable (Börnick and Schmidt, 2006). Furthermore, 
the azo dyes are relevant in terms of eco- and human toxicity, industrially produced in high 
quantities, and known to occur in hydrosphere. 
The azo dyes can accept protons because of th e free electron pair of the nitrogen, and the 
free electron pair of nitrogen interacts with the delocalized π-orbital system. 
Acceptor substituients at the aromatic ring such as –Cl or –NO 2 cause an additional decrease 
in the basic character of aminic groups. Donor groups such as –CH 3 or –OR (in metha and 
para position) lead to an increase in the basicity of aromati c aminic groups. However, donor 
substituients in the ortho position can steric ally impede the protonation and consequently 
decrease the basicity of aminic groups. Th e azo dyes are characterized by amphoteric 
properties when molecules contain additional ac idic groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl or 
sulfoxyl substituents. 
Depending on pH value, the azo dyes can be anionic (deprotonation at the acidic group), 
cationic (protonated at the amino group) or  non-ionic. Accordingly, knowledge of the 
acidity constants is indispensable for the ch aracterization of the behavior of azo dyes. 
Environmental partitioning is influenced by su bstituents as well as the number of carbon 
atoms and aromatic structure of the carbon skel eton. The presence of an amino group causes 
a higher boiling point, a higher water solubility, a lower Henry’s law constant, and a higher 
mobility in comparison with hydrocarbons (t he amino group can also reduce the mobility 
by specific interactions with solids via covalent bonding to carbonyl moieties or cation 
exchange) (Börnick and Schmidt, 2006). The volatility of azo dyes  in aqueous solution is in 
most cases very low. Some colour characteristics from different studies, tests and literatu re 
data are presented in Table 10, especially for reactive dyes.  
The chromophore distribution in reactive dy es indicated that the great majority of 
unmetallised azo dyes are yellow, orange and red. Contrarily, the blue, green, black and 
brown contain a much more proportion of metal-complex azo, anthraquinone, 
triphenyldioxazine or copper phthaloc yanine chromophores (Table 10).

In general, colour in wastewater is classified  in terms of true/real colour (i.e. colour of 
turbidity-free water sample), or apparent colour (i.e. colour of non-treated water sample). 
The most common methods to measure the colour  of dye solution or  dispersion, and/or 
wastewater are visual comparison and spectropho tometry, although there is still a lack of an 
universal method to classify colo ured wastewater discharges. By visual comparison , colour is 
quantified by comparing the colour of sample with either known concentrations of coloured 
standards (normally a platinum-cobalt solution), or properly calibrated colour disks, and is 
less applicable for highly coloured industrial wastewaters. In the spectrophotometric method , 
colour-measuring protocols differ between the methodologies, of which the most commonly 
used are Tristimulus Filter  Method, American Dye Manufacturer Institute (ADMI) 
Tristimulus Filter Method, an d Spectra record (Table 11). 
 
Spectrophotometric 
method Description  
Tristimulus  Three tristimulus light filters combined with a specific light source 
(i.e. tungsten lamp) and a photoelectric cell inside a filter 
photometer. The output transmittanc e is converted to trichromatic 
coefficient and colour characteristic value. 
ADMI Tristimulus The ADMI colour value provides a true watercolour measure, 
which can be differentiated in 3 (WL) ADMI (i.e. the transmittance 
is recorded at 590, 540 and 438 nm) or 31 (WL) ADMI (i.e. the 
transmittance is determined each 10 nm in the range of 400-700 nm). 
Spectra record The complete spectrum is recorded, and the entire spectrum, or a 
part of it, is used for comparison. A modified method has been 
suggested in which areas beneath an extinction curve represent 
the colour intensity, being expressed as space units. 
Table 11. Spectrophotometric methods for co lour determination in dye solution or 
dispersion, water and wastewater (ada pted from Dos Santos et al., 2004). 
2.3 Dye fixation on textile fibres 
In general, textile fibres can catched dyes in  their structures as a result of van der Waals 
forces, hydrogen bonds and hydr ophobic interactions (physical adsorption). The uptake of 
the dye in fibres depends on the dye nature and its chemical constituents. But the strongest 
dye-fibre attachment is a result of a covale nt bond with an additional electrostatic 
interaction where the dye ion and fibre ha ve opposite charges (chemisorption).

the Stockholm Convention – Envi ronmental and Analytical Update 
 66
In alkaline conditions (i.e. pH 9-12), at high temperatures (30-70ºC), and salt concentration 
from 40-100 g/L, reactive dyes form a reactive vinyl sulfone ( ─SO 3─CH═CH 2) group, which 
creates a bond with the fibres. However, the vi nyl sulfone group underg oes hydrolysis (i.e. a 
spontaneous reaction that occurs  in the presence of water), and because the products do not 
have any affinity with the fibres, they do not fo rm a covalent bond (Dos Santos et al., 2004). 
Therefore, a high amount of dye constitu ents are discharged in  the wastewater.  
The fixation efficiency varies with the class of azo dye used, which is around 98% for basic 
dyes and 50% for reactive dyes (Table 12) (Ber tea A. & Bertea A.P., 2008; O'Neill et al., 1999). 
Large amounts of salts such as sodium nitrate, sodium sulphate and sodium chloride are 
used in the dyebath, as well as sodium hydrox ide that is widely applied to increase the pH 
to the alkaline range. It is es timated that during the merceris ing process the weight of these 
salts can make up 20% of the fibre weight (EPA, 1997).

Table 12. Fixation degree of different dy e classes on textile support (EWA, 2005). 
The problem of high coloured effluent or dy e-containing effluent has become identified 
particularly with the dyeing of cellulose fibres  (cotton – 50% of the total consumed fibres in 
the textile industry worldwide), and in particul ar with the use of reactive dyes (10-50% loss 
in effluent), direct dyes (5-30% loss in effl uent), vat dyes (5-20% loss in effluent), and 
sulphur dyes (10-40% loss in effluent). 
The research for dynamic response and improved dyeing productivity has served to focus 
the attention of the textile coloration industry on right-first-time prod uction techniques that 
minimise wastes, make important contribution to reduce colour loads in the effluent by 
optimisation of processes, minimising of dye wastage, and control automatically the dyeing 
and printing operation. 
After the textile dyeing and finishing processes, a predicted environmental concentration  of a 
dye in the receiving water can be estimated based on the following factors: ( i) daily dye 
usage; ( ii) dye fixation degree on the substrate (i.e. textile fibres or fabrics); ( iii) dye 
removal degree into the effluent treatment process, and ( iv) dilution factor in the receiving 
water.  
Some scenario analyses were mentioned the values of dye concentration in some receiving 
rivers of 5-10 mg/L (average value, 50 days each year) or 1300-1555 mg/L (the worst case, 2 
days each year) for batchwise dyeing of co tton with reactive dyes, and of 1.2-3 mg/L 
(average value, 25 days each year) or 300-364 mg/L (the worst case, 2 days each year) for 
batchwise dyeing of wool yarn with ac id dyes (adapted from Cooper Ed., 1995). 
Limits on dye-containing orga nic loads will become more rest rictive in the future, which 
makes cleaning exhausts an environmental necessity.

3. Textile organic dyes – Environmental problems and p olluting effects 
The environmental issues associated with residu al dye content or residual colour in treated 
textile effluents are always a concern for each te xtile operator that directly discharges, both 
sewage treatment works and commercial textile op erations, in terms of respecting the colour 
and residual dye requirem ents placed on treated effluent discharge (Zaharia et al., 2011). 
Dye concentrations in watercourses higher of  1 mg/L caused by the direct discharges of 
textile effluents, treated or not, can give rise  to public compliant. High concentrations of 
textile dyes in water bodies stop the reoxygenation capacity of the receiving water and cut -
off sunlight, thereby upsetting biological activity in aquatic life and also the photosynt hesis 
process of aquatic plants or algae (Zaharia et al., 2009).  
The colour in watercourses is accepted as an  aesthetic problem rather than an eco-toxic 
hazard. Therefore, the public seems to accept blue, green or br own colour of rivers but the 
‘non-natural’ colour as red and purple usually cause most concern. 
The polluting effects of dyes against aquatic environment can be also the result of toxic 
effects due to their long time presence in envi ronment (i.e. half-life time of several years), 
accumulation in sediments but especially in fi shes or other aquatic life forms, decomposition 
of pollutants in carcinogenic or mutagenic compounds but also low aerobic 
biodegradability. Due to their synthetic nature  and structure mainly aromatic, the most of 
dyes are non-biodegradable, having carcinogenic action or causing allergies, dermatitis, skin 
irritation or different tissul ar changes. Moreover, variou s azo dyes, mainly aromatic 
compounds, show both acute and chronic toxicity. High potential health risk is caused by 
adsorption of azo dyes and their breakd own products (toxic amines) through the 
gastrointestinal tract, skin, lungs, and also formation of hemoglobin adducts and 
disturbance of blood formation. LD 50 values reported for aromatic azo dyes range between 
100 and 2000 mg/kg body weight (Börnick & Schmidt, 2006). 
Several azo dyes cause damage of DNA that can lead to the genesis of malignant tumors. 
Electron-donating substituents in ortho and para position ca n increase the carcinogenic 
potential. The toxicity diminished essentially with the protonation of aminic groups. Some 
o f  t h e  b e s t  k n o w n  a z o  d y e s  ( e . g .  D i r e c t  Black 38 azo dye, precursor for benzidine; 
azodisalicylate, precursor for 4-phenylened iamine) and their breakdown derivatives 
inducing cancer in humans and animals are be nzidine and its derivatives, and also a large 
number of anilines (e.g. 2-nitroaniline, 4- chloroaniline, 4,4’-dimethylendianiline, 4-
phenylenediamine, etc.), nitrosamines, dimethylamines, etc. 
The main pollution characteristics and category (pollution risk) of the principal products 
used in processing of textile material s are summarized in Table 13 (EWA, 2005). 
In different toxicological studies are indicated that 98% of dyes has a lethal concentration 
value (LC 50) for fishes higher than 1 mg/L, and 59% have an LC 50 value higher than 100 
mg/L (i.e. 31% of 100-500 mg/L and 28% higher than 500 mg/L).  
Other ecotoxicological studies in dicated that over 18% of 200 dy es tested in England showed 
significant inhibition of the respiration rate of the biomass (i.e. wastewater bacteria) from 
sewage, and these were all basic dyes (adapted from Cooper, 1995).  
The bioaccumulation potential of dyes in fish was also an important measure estimating the 
bioconcentration factor (dye concentration in fish/dye concentration in water). No 
bioaccumulation is expected for dyes with solubility in water higher than 2000 mg/L.  
Dyes are not biodegradable in aerobic wastew ater treatment processes and some of them 
may be intactly adsorbed by the sludge at wastewater biological treatment (i.e. 
bioelimination by adsorptive removal of dyes).

Some investigations of adsorption degree onto sludge of some azo dyes indicated typically 
high levels of adsorption for basic or direct dyes, and high to medium range for disperse 
dyes, all the others having very low adso rption, which appears to depend on the 
sulphonation degree or ease of hydrolysis. These tested azo dyes  are presented in Table 14.

Table 14. Fate of water-soluble azo dyes in  the activated sludge treatment (Cooper, 1995) 
The high degree of sulphonation of azo dyes in Group 1 enhanced their water solubility and 
limited their ability to be adsorbed on the biomass. The dyes in Group 2 were also highly 
sulphonated but permitted a relatively g ood adsorption performance on sludge. 
Other information in bioelimination of different reactive dyes mentioned that monoazo dyes 
are particularly poorly adsorbed, and dis azos, anthraquinones, triphendioxazines and 
phthalocyanines are generally much better adsorbed than monoazos.  
It is important to underline that toxic compou nds (e.g. toxic aromatic amines, benzidine and 
its derivatives) can be formed in the envi ronment via transformation of textile dye-
precursors (e.g., reduction or hydrolysis of te xtile azo dyes). The textile dye-precursors are

and Separation/Elimination Procedures from I ndustrial Effluents – A Critical Overview

introduced in water environment due to indu strial production of dyes and industrial 
production of textile fibres, fabrics and clot hes via wastewater, sludge, or solid deposits. 
The quality problem of dye content and/or colo ur in the dyehouse effluent discharged in 
watercourses can be solved by  using of a range of advanced decolourisation technologies 
investigated by the major dye suppliers, te xtile operators and cu stomers who are under 
pressure to reduce colour and residual dye levels in their effluents.  
4. Textile organic dyes – Separation and elimination pr ocedures from water 
environment (especially industrial wastewater) 
The textile organic dyes must be separated an d eliminated (if necessary) from water but 
especially from industrial wastewaters by effective and viable treatments at sewage 
treatment works or on site following two different treatment concepts as: ( 1) separation of 
organic pollutants from water environment, or ( 2) the partial or complete mineralization or 
decomposition of organic pollutants. Separation processes are based on fluid mechanics 
(sedimentation, centrifugation, f iltration and flotation) or on synthetic membranes (micro-, 
ultra- and nanofiltration, reverse osmosis). A dditionally, physico-chem ical processes (i.e. 
adsorption, chemical precipitation, coagulat ion-flocculation, and ionic exchange) can be 
used to separate dissolved, emulsified and solid-separating compounds from water 
environment (Anjaneyulu et al., 2005; Babu et al ., 2007; Robinson et al., 2001; Suteu et al., 
2009a; Suteu et al., 2011a; Zaharia, 2006; Zaha ria et al., 2009; Zaharia et al., 2011).  
The partial and complete mineralization or decomposition of pollutants can be achieved by 
biological and chemical processes (biological processes in connection with the activated 
sludge processes and membrane bioreactor s, advanced oxidation with ozone, H 2O2, UV) 
(Dos Santos et al., 2004 ; Oztekin et al., 2010 ; Wiesmann et al., 2007 ; Zaharia et al., 2009).  
A textile operator will decide on  options available to plan forward strategy that will ensure 
compliance with the environmental regulators’ requirements on a progressive basis focused 
on some options and applied so lutions of different separati on processes (sedimentation, 
filtration, membrane separation), and some physico-chemical treatment steps (i.e. 
adsorption; coagulation-flocculation with inorganic coagulants and organic polymers; 
chemical oxidation; ozonation; electrochemical pr ocess, etc.) integrated into a specific order 
in the technological process of wastewater treatment for decolourization or large-scale 
colour and dye removal processes of textile effluents.  
To introduce a logical order in the descripti on of treatment methods for textile dye and 
colour removal, the relationship between pollutant and respective typical treatment 
technology is taken as referenc e. The first treatment step for textile wastewater and also 
rainwater is the separation of suspended solids  and immiscible liquids from the main textile 
effluents by gravity separation (e.g., grit separation, sedimentation including 
coagulation/flocculation), filtration, membrane filtration (MF, UF), air flotation, and/or 
other oil/water separation operations.  
The following treatment steps ar e applied to soluble pollutants , when these are transferred 
into solids (e.g., chemical precipitation, coagulation/flocculation, etc.) or gaseous and 
soluble compounds with low or high dangerous/toxic effect (e.g., chemical oxidation, 
ozonation, wet air oxidation, adsorption, io n exchange, stripping, nanofiltration/reverse 
osmosis). Solid-free wastewater can either be  segregated into a biodegradable and a non-
biodegradable part, or the contaminants resp onsible for the non-biodegradable wastewater 
part that can be decomposed based on phys ical and/or chemical processes. After an

adequate treatment, the treated wastewater ( WW) can either be discharged into a receiving 
water body, into a subsequent central biologic al wastewater treatment plant (BWWTP) or a 
municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP). 
Some selected treatment processes for dyes an d colour removal of industrial wastewater 
applied over the time into different textile un its are summarized in Table 15. Some of these

4.1 Physical treatments 
4.1.1 Adsorption 
One of the most effective and proven treatm ent with potential application in textile 
wastewater treatment is adsorpti on. This process consists in th e transfer of soluble organic 
dyes (solutes) from wastewater to the surfac e of solid, highly porous, particles (the 
adsorbent). The adsorbent has a finite capacity for each compound to be removed, and when 
i s  ‘ s p e n t ’  m u s t  b e  r e p l a c e d  b y  f r e s h  m a t e r i al (the ‘spent’ adsorbent must be either 
regenerated or incinerated).  
Adsorption is an economically feasible proce ss for dyes removal and/or decolourization of 
textile effluents being the result of two me chanisms: adsorption and ion exchange. The 
principal influencing factors in dye adsorption  are: dye/adsorbent interaction, adsorbent 
surface area, particle size, temperature, pH , and contact time. Adsorbents which contain 
amino nitrogen tend to have a significantly larger adsorption capacity in acid dyes.  
The most used adsorbent is activated ca rbon, and also other commercial inorganic 
adsorbents. Some ‘low cost’ adsorbents of indust rial or agricultural wastes (i.e. peat, coal 
ashes, refused derived coal fuel, clay, bentonite and modified bentonite, red soil, bauxite, 
ebark, rice husk, tree barks, neem leaf powder , wood chips, ground nut shell powder, rice 
hulls, bagasse pith, wood sawdust, grounded sunflower seed shells, other ligno-cellulosic 
wastes, etc.) are also used for removal of dye and organic coloured matter from textile 
effluents (i.e. a removal of 40-90% basic dyes and 40% direct dyes, with maximum 
adsorption capacities for basic dyes of 338 mg/g) (Anjaneyulu et al., 2005; Bhattacharyya & 
Sarma, 2003; Gupta et al., 1992; Nigam et al., 2000; Ozcan et al.,  2004; Robinson et al., 2001; 
Suteu & Zaharia, 2008; Suteu et al., 2009b; Sute u et al., 2011a,b; Zaharia et al., 2011). The use 
of these materials is advantageous mainly due to their widespread availability and 
cheapness. Sometimes the regeneration is not necessary and the ‘spent’ material is 
conventionally burnt although there is potential for solid state fermentation (SSF) for protein 
enrichment. The use of ‘low cost’ adsorbents  for textile dye removal is profitable but 
requires huge quantity of adsorbents, being lower efficient than activated carbon. Some 
authors’ results for dye adsorption are summarized in Table 16.

Adsorption with activated carbon.  Activated carbon have been engineered for optimal 
adsorption of the contaminants found in dyehou se effluents: large, negatively charged or 
polar molecules of dyes. Powdered or granular  activated carbon (specific surface area of 
500-1500 m2/g; pore volume of 0.3-1 cm3/g; bulk density of 300-550 g/L) has a reasonably 
good colour removal capacity when is introduced in a separate filtration step. The activated 
carbon is used as granulate (GAC) in column s or as powder (PAC) in batchwise treatment 
into a specific treatment tank or basin. High removal rates are obtained for cationic mordant 
and acid dyes (Anjaneyulu et al., 2005), and a slig htly lesser extent (moderate) for dispersed, 
direct, vat, pigment and reactive dyes (Coo per, 1995; Nigam et al., 2000) with consumable 
doses of 0.5-1.0 kg adsorbent/m3 wastewater (i.e. dye removal of 60-90%).  
Most recent studies mentioned that an effective irreversible adsorption of dye molecules 
onto the adsorbent particles takes place via a combination of physical adsorption of dye 
onto adsorbent surfaces within the microporous structure of th e particles, enhanced by an 
ion-exchange process wherein the interlayer anions of the ad sorbent are displaced by the 
dye molecules, and also inter-particle diffusion processes. Removal of pollutants can take 
place at any pH between 2 and 11, and at any temperature between 0 and 100 °C (effluent 
temperature as received, generally 30-40 °C).

The adsorption on activated carbon without pretreatment is imposible because the 
suspended solids rapidly clog the filter, and may be feasible in combination with 
flocculation-sedimentation trea tment or a biological treatment (Masui et al., 2005; Ramesh 
Babu et al., 2007). The main impo rtant disadvantage of this process is attributed to the high 
cost of activated carbon. Performance is dependent on the type of activated carbon used and 
wastewater characteristics, and can be well suited for one particular wastewater system and 
ineffective in another. The activated carbon ha s to be reactivated otherwise disposal of the 
concentrates has to be considered (reactivatio n results in 10-15% loss of the adsorbent).  
4.1.2 Irradiation 
The irradiation treatment is a simple and effi cient procedure for eliminating a wide variety 
of organic contaminants, and as well disinfecting harmful microorganism using gamma rays 
or electron beams (e.g., source for irradiat ion can be a monochromatic UV lamps working 
under 253.7 nm). A high quantity  of dissolved oxygen is required for an organic dye to be 
effectively broken down by irradiation. The di ssolved oxygen is consumed very rapidly and 
so a constant and adequate supply is required. Irradiation treatment of a secondary effluent 
from sewage treatment plant reduced COD,  TOC and colour up to 64%, 34% and 88% 
respectively, at a dose of 15 K Gy gamma-ra ys (Borrely et al., 1998). The efficiency of 
irradiation treatment increases when is used ca talyst as titanium dioxide (Krapfenbauer et 
al., 1999). A lot of data are reported with the practical results obtained at the simple 
exposure of different dye solutions or dispersions and dye-containing textile wastewaters to 
sunlight for a period of a half, one or two mo nths (direct photolysis with natural sunlight 
into open basins). All these reports indicated high removals of colour (>84%), dye 
destruction by photooxidation following first order kinetics at treatment of some vat dye 
effluents. But the direct photolysis of textile  organic dye in the natural aquatic environment 
has proven difficult due to strong dependence of the decay rates on dye reactivity and 
photosensitivity. Most of all commercial dyes are usually designed to be light resistant . 
Therefore, the recent researches have been directed towards investigation of organic dye 
photodegradation by sensitizers or cataly sts in aqueous/dispersion systems by UV 
irradiation. Moreover, there are reported high removal of indigo-colour when is initiated a 
laser fading process for indigo coloured denim textile mainly based on basic interaction of 
laser beam with indigo-coloured textile (Dascalu et al., 2000). 
4.1.3 Membrane processes 
The increasing of water cost and necessity of reduction of water consumption implies 
treatment process which is integrated with in-plant water circuits rather than subsequent 
treatment (Baban et al., 2010; Machenbach , 1998). From this point of view, membrane 
filtration offers potential application in combination with other textile effluent treatments.  
Membrane processes for wastewater treatment are pressure-driven processes, capable to 
clarify, concentrate, and most important, sepa rate dye discontinuously from effluent (Xu & 
Lebran, 1991). These are new technologies, which can restrict organic contaminants and 
microorganisms presented in wastewater (i.e. color removal, BO D reduction, salt reduction, 
Polyvinyl Acetate (PVA) recovery, and latex recovery). The common membrane filtration 
types are: Micro-Filtration (MF), Ultra-Filtra tion (UF), Nano-Filtration (NF), and Reverse 
Osmosis (RO). The choice of the membrane proc ess must be guided by the required quality 
of the final effluent.

and Separation/Elimination Procedures from I ndustrial Effluents – A Critical Overview 
 75 
Micro-filtration is mainly used for treatment of dye baths containing pigment dyes as well 
as for subsequent rinsing baths (Ramesh Babu  et al., 2007). Chemicals that can not be 
filtrated by microfiltration will remain in th e dye bath. Microfiltration can be used as a 
pretreatment for nanofiltration or reverse osmosis (Ghayeni et al., 1998), and also to separate 
suspended solids, colloids from effluents or ma cromolecules with pores of 0.1 to 1 micron. 
MF performance is typically of >90% for turbidity or silt density index. Microfiltration 
membranes are made of specific polymers such as Poly (Ether Sulfone), Poly (Vinylidiene 
Fluoride), Poly (Sulfone), Poly (Vinylidene Difluoride), Polycarbonate, Polypropylene, Poly 
Tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), etc. Ceramic, glass, carbon, zircon ia coated carbon, alumina and 
sintered metal membranes have been employed where extraordinary chemical resistance or 
where high temperature operation is necessa ry. MF and UF operate at 20 to 100 psi 
transmembrane pressures (Ptm) (low pressure membrane procees) and velocities of 20 to 
100 cm/s (Naveed et al., 2006). 
Ultra-filtration is used to separate macromolecules and particles, but the elimination of 
polluting substances such as dyes is never complete (only 31-76% dye removal). The quality 
of treated wastewater does not permit its reuse for sensitive processes, such as textile dyeing 
(Ramesh Babu et al., 2007) but permit recycling of 40% treated wastewater in stages in which 
salinity is not a problem, such as rinsing, washin g, etc. Ultrafiltration can only be used as a 
pretreatment for reverse osmosis (Ciardelli & Ranieri, 2001) or in combination with a 
biological reactor (Mignani et al., 1999) or to remove metal hydroxides (reducing the heavy 
metal content to 1 ppm or less) (Naveed et al., 2006). UF membranes are made of polymeric 
materials (i.e. polysulfone, polypropylene,  nylon-6, polytetraf luoroethylene (PTFE), 
polyvinyl chlorides (PVC), acrylic copolymer etc. 
Nano-Filtration was used for the treatment of coloured  effluents from the textile industry, 
mainly in a combination of adsorption (for decreasing of concentration polarization during 
the filtration process) and nanofiltration (NF modules are extremely sensitive to fouling by 
colloidal material and macromolecules). NF membranes are generally made of cellulose 
acetate and aromatic polyamides, and retain low-molecular weight organic compounds, 
divalent ions, large monovalent ions, hydrolized reactive dyes, and dyeing auxiliaries. 
Inorganic materials, such as ceramics, carbon based membranes, zirconia, are also used in 
manufacturing NF and RO membranes. Typical NF flux rates are 5 to 30 GFD (Gross Flow 
per Day) (Naveed et al., 2006). A performance of above 70% colour removal for a NF plant 
was reported working at 8 bar/18 °C, with four polyethersulphonate membranes with 
molecular weight cut offs of 40, 10, 5 and 3 kda for three different effluents coming from 
dyeing cycle of textile industry  (Alves & Pinho, 2000). Values of colour removal higher than 
90% were reported for single NF process, and also combination MF and NF, in the case of 
different effluents from textile fabrics processi ng. Harmful effects of high concentrations of 
dye and salts in the dye house effluents were fr equently reported (i.e. concentration of dye > 
1.5 g/L, and of mineral salts >20 g/L) (Tang & Chen, 2002). An important problem is the 
acculumation of dissolved solids, which makes discharge of treated effluents in 
watercourses almost impossible. NF treatment can be an altern ative fairly satisfactory for 
textile effluent decolourization.  
Reverse Osmosis is used to remove in a single step most types of ionic compounds, 
hydrolized reactive dyes, chemical auxiliaries, and produce a high quality of permeate 
(Ramesh Babu et al., 2007). Like NF, RO is very sensitive to fo uling and the influent must be 
carefully pretreated. RO membranes are genera lly made of cellulose acetate and aromatic 
polyamides but also of inorganic materials. Th e Ptm in RO is typically 500 to 1000 psi, with 
www.intechopen.comOrganic Pollutants Ten Years After  
the Stockholm Convention – Envi ronmental and Analytical Update 
 76
cross flows of 20 to 100 cm/s. The range of typi cal RO fluxes is 5 to 15 GFD (Naveed et al., 
2006). In combination with physio-chemical treatment, the membrane processes has 
advantages over the other conventional treatmen ts, such as the ability to recover materials 
with valuable recyclable water, reductin g fresh water consumption and wastewater 
treatment costs, small disposal volumes which minimizes waste disposal costs, red uction of 
regulatory pressure and fine improved heat recovery systems. Membrane processes have 
many cost-effective applications in textile industry.  
4.2 Chemical treatment 
4.2.1 Oxidative processes 
Chemical oxidation represents the conversion or  transformation of po llutants by chemical 
oxidation agents other than oxygen/air or bacter ia to similar but less harmful or hazardous 
compounds and/or to short-chained and ea sily biodegradable organic components 
(aromatic rings cleavage of dye molecules).  
The modern textile dyes are resistant to mild oxidation conditions such those existing in 
biological treatment systems.  Therefore, efficient dye an d colour removal must be 
accomplished by more powerful oxidising agents  such as chlorines, ozone, Fenton reagents, 
UV/peroxide, UV/ozone, or other oxid ising procedures or combinations. 
Oxidative processes with hydrogen peroxide.  The oxidation processes with hydrogen 
peroxide (H 2O2) (oxidation potential, E °= 1.80 V at pH 0, and E °= 0.87 V at pH 14) can be 
explored as wastewater treatment alternativ es in two systems: (1) homogenous systems 
based on the use of visible or ultraviolet light , soluble catalysts (Fenton reagents) and other 
chemical activators (e.g. ozone, peroxidase etc.) and (2) heterogenous systems based on the 
use of semiconductors, zeolites, clays with or without ultraviolet light, such as TiO 2, stable 
modified zeolites with iron and aluminium (i.e. FeY 5, FeY 11.5 etc.) (difficulty encountered in 
the separation of the solid photocatalysts at the end of the process) (Neamtu et al., 2004; 
Zaharia et al., 2009).  
Fenton reagent is usually hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) that is activated by some iron salts (i.e. 
Fe2+ s a l t s )  ( w i t h o u t  U V  i r r a d i a t i o n )  t o  f o r m  h y d r o x y l  r a d i c a l s  ( H O.) which are strong 
oxidants (oxidation potential, E °= 3.06 V) than H 2O2 and ozone. The Fenton oxidation 
reactions are detailed in other chapters of th is book, and the treatm ent efficiency depends 
mainly of effluent characteristic s, and operating parameters (e.g ., colour removal of 31.10 or 
56.20%, at a pH of 4.00, for Fenton oxidation of textile Remazol Arancio 3R, Remazol Rose 
RB dye-containing effluent s working with 0.18-0.35 M H 2O2 and 1.45 mM Fe2+, after 30 or 
120 min) (Zaharia et al., 2011).  
Heterogenous catalytic oxidation with 20 mM H 2O2 and FeY 11.5 (1 g/L) of Procion Marine H-
EXL dye-containing effluents lead to colour removal of 53-83%, COD removal of 68-76% and 
TOC removal of 32-37% at pH=3-5, after 10 min of oxidation (Neamtu et al., 2004). Working 
with FeY 5 (1 g/L) and 20 mM H 2O2, at pH=3 and 5, for the same textile effluent the treatment  
efficiency , was of 95 and 35% for colour and COD removal after 10 min of oxidation, and 97% 
for colour after 60 min of oxidation; COD removal (60 min) of 64.20% (Zaharia, 2006). 
When small quantities of wast ewater are involved or when there is no biotreatment 
available at the textile site, chemical oxidat ion might be recommendable treatment option 
instead of installing a central biological WWT pl ant. Advantages of this oxidative treatment 
include reduction of effluent COD, colour and toxicity, and also the possibility to be us ed to 
remove both soluble and insoluble dyes (i.e. disperse dyes). Complete decolourization was 
obtained after the complete Fenton reagent stage (gener ally 24 hours).

and Separation/Elimination Procedures from I ndustrial Effluents – A Critical Overview 
 77 
Ozonation process. Ozone is a powerful oxidising agent (oxidation potential, E °= 2.07 V) 
capable of cleavage the aromatic rings of some textile dyes and descomposition of other 
organic pollutants from industrial effluents. The ozone decomposes the organic dyes with 
conjugated double bonds forming smaller mole cules with increased carcinogenic or toxic 
properties, and so ozonation may be used alongs ide a physical method to prevent this (i.e. 
irradiation, membrane separation, adsorption, etc). Ozone can react directly or indirectly 
with dye molecules. In the direct  pathway, the ozone molecule is itself the electron acceptor, 
and hydroxide ions (i.e. pH > 7-8) catalyze the auto decomposition of ozone to hydroxyl 
radicals (·OH) in aqueous effluents (very strong and non-selective oxidants) which react 
with organic and inorganic chemicals. At low pH ozone efficiently reacts with unsaturated 
chromophoric bonds of a dye molecule vi a direct reactions (Adams & Gorg, 2002).  
The main advantage is that ozone can be applied in its gaseous state and therefore does not 
increase the volume of wastewater and sludge. A disadvantage of ozonation is its short half-
life, tipically being 20 min, the destabilisation by  the presence of salts, pH, and temperature, 
and the additional costs for the installation  of ozonation plant. The improvement of 
ozonation preformance is obtained in combinat ion with irradiation (Surpateanu & Zaharia, 
2004a; Zaharia et al., 2009) or with a membrane filtration technique (Lopez et al., 1999). 
Treatment of dye-containing wastewater wi th ozone followed by chemical coagulation 
using Ca(OH) 2 indicated 62% colour removal after ozonation (Sarasa et al., 1998).  
Oxidation process with sodium hypochlorite. This treatment implie s the attack at the 
amino group of the dye molecule by Cl+, initiating and accelerating azo-bond cleavage. The 
increasing of chlorine concentration favors the dye removal and decolourization process, 
and also the decreasing of pH. The dye contai ning amino or substitu ted amino groups on 
the naphthalene ring (i.e. dyes derived from  amino-naphtol- and naphtylamino-sulphonic 
acids) are most susceptible for chlorine de colourization (Omura, 1994). This treatment is 
unsuitable for disperse dyes, and is becoming less frequent due to the negative effects at 
releasing into watercourses of aromatic amin es or otherwise toxic molecules. Moreover, 
althought about 40% of the pigments used worl dwise contain chlorine this corresponds to 
only less than 0.02% of the total chlori ne production (Slokar & Le Marechal, 1997). 
Photochemical oxidation process. The UV treatment in the presence of H 2O2 can 
descomposed dye molecules to low weight organic molecules, or even to CO 2, H 2O, other 
inorganic oxides, hydrides, etc. There can be also produced additional by-products such as 
halides, metals, inorganic acids, organic alde hydes and organic acids depending on initial 
materials and the extent of decolourisat ion treatment (Yang et al., 1998). The dye 
decomposition is initiated by the generated hydroxyl radicals (H 2O2 + hυ → 2HO·) and 
hydroperoxide radicals (H 2O2 + HO· → HO 2· + H 2O).  
The treatment may be set-up in a batch or cont inuous column unit, and is influenced by the 
intensity of the UV radiation, pH, dye struct ure and the dye bath composition (Slokar & Le 
Marechal, 1997). The performance of photooxidati on treatment in the pr esence of hydrogen 
peroxide are high (i.e. >60-90% for co lour removal, working with 400-500 mg/L H 2O2 at pH 
3-7, for Red M5B, H-acid and Blue MR dye-cont aining effluents) (Anjaneyulu et al., 2005) or 
81-94% dye removal after 60 min, working with 88 mM H 2O2 at pH of 4-6, for Acid Red G 
dye-containing effluent (Surpateanu & Zaharia, 2004b; Zaharia et al., 2009). 
Electrochemical oxidation process. As an advanced process, the electrochemical treatment 
of dye-containing effluents is a potentially po werful method of pollution control, offering 
high removal efficiencies (Anjaneyulu et al.,  2005) especially for acid dyes as well as

 78
disperse and metal complex dyes. The main adva ntages of this treatment are considered the 
requirement of simple equipment and operation,  low temperature in comparison with other 
non-electrochemical treatments, no requirement of any additional chemicals, easy control 
but crucial for pH, the electrochemical reactors  (with electrolytic cells) are compact, and 
prevent the production of unwated by-pro ducts. The principal oxidising agent in 
electrochemical process is hypochlorite ion or  hypochlorous acid produced from naturally 
occuring chloride ions. Hydroxyl radical and other reactive species also participate in 
electrochemical oxidation of organics (Kim et al., 2002) that can be achieved directly or 
indirectly at the anode. The breakdown co mpounds are generally not hazardous being 
discharged into watercourses without im portant environmental and health risks. 
The electrochemical oxidation is considered an efficient and economic treatment of recycling 
textile wastewater for the dyeing stage. The environmental advantage mainly achieved is 
the minimization of all emissions: emission of gases, solid waste, and liquid effluent. Other 
important advantage is its capacity of adaptation to different volumes and pollution loads. 
The main disadvantage is the generation of metallic hydroxide sludge (from the metallic 
electrodes in the cell), that limits its use (Ramesh Babu et al., 2007).  
Some studies reported colour removals of ab out 100% for dyeing wastewater within only 6 
min of electrolysis (Vlyssides et  al., 2000) (e.g., complete decolourization of textile effluent 
containing blue-26 anthraquinone dye by el ectrochemical oxidation with lead dioxide 
coated anode - Titanium Substrac t Insoluble Anode (TSIA), at ne utral pH, in the presence of 
sodium chloride, current density of 4.5 A/dm2, electrolysis time of 220 min, or maximum 
95.2% colour and 72.5% COD removal of textile azo dye-containing effluent in a flow reactor 
working at rate of 5 mL/min and current density of 29.9 mA/cm2) (Anjaneyulu et al., 2005).  
4.2.2 Coagulation-floccu lation and precipitation 
It is clearly known that the coloured colloid particles from textile effluents cannot be 
separated by simple gravitational means, and some chemicals (e.g., ferrous sulphate, ferric 
sulphate, ferric chloride, lime, polyaluminium chloride, polyaluminium sulphate, cationic 
organic polymers, etc.) are added to cause th e solids to settle. These chemicals cause 
destabilisation of colloidal and small suspended particles (e.g. dyes, clay, heavy metals, 
organic solids, oil in wastewater) and emulsion s entrapping solids (coagulation) and/or the 
agglomeration of these particles to flocs larg e enough to settle (flocculation) or highly 
improve further filtration (Zaharia et al., 2006; Zaharia et al., 2007). In the case of 
flocculation, anionic and non-ionic polymers are also used.  
The mechanism by which synthetic organic polymer removes dissolved residual dyes from 
effluents is best described in terms of the el ectrostatic attraction between the oppositely 
charged soluble dye and polymer molecules. Many of the most problematic dye types, such 
as reactive dyes, carry a residual negative charge in their hydrolysed dissolved form, and so 
positively charged groups on the polymers pr ovide the neccesary counter for the interaction 
and subsequent precipitation to occur. The imme diate result of this coprecipitation is the 
almost instantaneous production of very small coloured particles, having little strength and 
breaking down at any significant disturba nces. The agglomeration of the coloured 
precipitates by using appropriate high polyel ectrolyte flocculants produces stable flocs 
(Zaharia et al., 2007, 2011). The main disadvantages of this treatment are the process control 
that is a little difficult, the potential affection of precipitation rate and floc size by impurities 
such as non-ionic detergents remaining in the effluent, and the sludge production which has 
to be settled, dewatered and pressed into a cake for subsequent  landfilling tipping.

There are reported very effective chemical coagulation-flocculation (C-F) and 
precipitation of textile wastewater which reduced the load on the biological trea tment, 
working with polyaluminium chloride along wi th an organic polymer (Lin & Chen, 1997) 
or ferrous/ferric chloride and a commercial or ganic coagulant aid at pH of 6.7-8.3 (colour 
removal > 80%) (Venkat Mohan et al., 1999) or alum at pH=8.2 (54-81% colour remo val) 
with addition of bentonite (3 g/L) for Remazol Violet dye-containing effluent (Sanghi et 
al., 2001). Other efficient textile treatments mentioned by different textile op erators consist 
in coagulation-flocculation followed by me mbrane technology (especially for recycling 
textile effluents). 
Some of authors’ results in different (C -F) treatments are summarized in Table 17.

4.2.3 Electrocoagulation 
An advanced electrochemical treatment for dy e and colour removal is electrocoagulation 
( E C )  t h a t  h a s  a s  m a i n  g o a l  t o  f o r m  f l o c s  o f  m e t a l  h y d r o x i d e s  w i t h i n  t h e  e f f l u e n t  t o  b e  
cleaned by electro-dissolution of soluble an odes. EC involves important processes as 
electrolytic reactions at electrodes, format ion of coagulants in aqueous effluent and 
adsorption of soluble or colloidal pollutants  on coagulants, and removal by sedimentation 
and flotation. This treatment is  efficient even at high pH for colour and COD removals being 
strongly influenced by the cu rrent density and duration of reaction. The EC treatment was 
applied with high efficiency for textile Oran ge II and Acid red 14 dy e-containing effluents 
(i.e. > 98% colour removal) (Daneshvar et al.,  2003) or Yellow 86 dye-containing wastewater 
(i.e. turbidity, COD, extractible substances, and dye removal of 87.20%, 49.89%, 94.67%, and  
74.20%, after 30 min of operation, current inte nsity of 1 A, with monopolar electrodes) 
(Zaharia et al, 2005) when iron is used as sacrificial anode. In general, decolorization 
performance in EC treatment is between 90-95%, and COD removal between 30-36% under 
optimal conditions (Rames h Babu et al., 2007).

4.2.4 Ionic exchange 
The ion exchange process has not be widely used  for treatment of dye-containing effluents, 
mainly because of the general opinion that io n exchangers cannot accomodate a wide range 
of dyes (Slokar & Le Marechal, 1997). 
The ionic exchange occurs mainly based on the interaction of ionic species from wastewater 
with an adsorptive solid material, being distin guished from the conventional adsorption by 
nature and morphology of adsorptive materi al or the inorganic structure containing 
functional groups capable of ionic exchange  (Macoveanu et al., 2002). The mechanisms of 
ionic exchange process are well known, and tw o principal aspects must be mentioned: (1) 
ionic exchange can be modeling as well as adsorption onto activated coal; (2) the ion 
exchangers can be regenerated without modifying the equilibrium condition (e.g., by 
passing of a salt solution containing original active groups under ion exchanger layer). In 
the case of wastewater treatment, the effluent  is passed over the ion exchanger resin until 
the available exchange sites are saturated (b oth cationic and anionic dyes are removed). 
The ionic exchange is a reversible process, and the regenerated ion exchanger can be reused. 
The essential characteristic of ionic exchange th at makes distinction of adsorption is the fact 
that the replace of ions takes place in stoech iometric proportion (M acoveanu et al., 2002). 
The effluent treatment by ionic exchange proces s contributes to the diminishing of energetic 
consumption and recovery of valuable compon ents under diverse forms, simultaneously 
with the wastewater treatment. In practice, the ion exchangers are used in combination with 
other wastewater treatments. The main advantag es of ion exchange are removal of soluble 
dyes, no loss of adsorbent at regeneration, and reclamation of solvent after use. The 
important disadvantages of this process is the cost, organic solvents are expensive, and ion 
exchange treatment is not efficient for disperse  dyes (Robinson et al., 2001). Our results in 
batchwise treatment of Brilli ant Red HE-3B dye-containing effluents (0.05 – 0.3 mg/mL) 
using anionic Purolite A-400 and Purolite A-500 indicated dye removal of 48-89% working 
in the optimal conditions, or dye removal of 56-78% for Crystal Violet (Basic Violet 3) using 
Purolite C-100 or dye removal between 78-89% fo r Reactive Blue M-EB using ion exchange 
celluloses (Suteu et al., 2002). 
4.3 Biological treatments 
Biological treatments are considered reproduc tion, artificially or otherwise, of self-
purification phenomena existing  in natural environment. Th ere are different biological 
treatments, performed in aerobic or anaerobi c or combined anaerobic/aerobic conditions. 
The processing, quality, adaptability of microorganisms, and the reactor type are decisive 
parameters for removal efficiency (Börnick & Schmidt, 2006). 
Biological treatment process for decolorization of  industrial effluents is ambiguous, different 
and divergent (Anjaneyulu et al ., 2005). Previous subchapters indi cate that dyes themselves 
are not biologically degradable since microorg anisms do not use the coloured constituents 
as a source of food. The most currently used biodegradation involve aerobic micro-
organisms, which utilize molecular oxygen as reducing equivalent acceptor during the 
respiration process. But biodegradation in anaerobic environment conditions (anoxic and 
hypoxic environments) also occurs, and survival of microorganisms is possible by using 
sulphates, nitrates and carbon  dioxide as electr on acceptors (Birch  et al., 1989).  
Research data indicates that certain dyes ar e susceptible to anoxic/anaerobic decolouri-
zation, and also that an anaerobic step fo llowed by an aerobic step may represent a 
www.intechopen.comTextile Organic Dyes – Characteristics, Polluting Effects  
and Separation/Elimination Procedures from I ndustrial Effluents – A Critical Overview 
 81 
significant advancement in biological decolour ization treatment in future (Ong et al., 2005). 
The treatment plant that receives  dye-containing effluents has high potential to form toxic 
biodegradation products such as  toxic amines, benzidine and its derivates, etc. To avoid that 
risk, anaerobic/aerobic sequential reactor syst ems seem to be an efficient procedure (i.e. 
efficient colour removal takes place during th e anaerobic treatment, and high reduction of 
aromatic amines and other organic compounds occurs during the subsequent aerobic 
treatment). Under aerobic conditions, most of the azo dye metabolites are quickly degraded 
by oxidation of the substituents  o r  o f  t h e  s i d e  b r a n c h e s .  H o w e v e r ,  s o m e  o f  t h e m  a r e  s t i l l  
rather recalcitrant. Successful removal of poorly degradable amines was often achieved by 
adaptation of microorganisms (i.e. acclimati zation of biological sludge to nitroaniline-
containing wastewaters; after gradual adaptati on, the microorganisms are able to eliminate 
3- and 4-nitroaniline simultaneously) (Börnick & Schmidt, 2006). Difficult to be biodegraded 
are also the aromatic amines containing su lfo substituents in metha position (e.g., 3-
aminobenzenesulfonate) that can be treated with good efficiencies  with flow-through 
bioreactors within 28 days. Contrarily, some experimental results found anaerobic 
mineralization to be efficient for aromatic amines.  
The main advantage of biological treatment in  comparison with certain physico-chemical 
treatments is that over 70% of organic matter expressed by COD Cr may be converted to 
biosolids (Anjaneyulu et al., 2005). 
4.3.1 Aerobic biological treatment 
Biological treatment with ‘activated sludge ’ was the most used in large scale textile 
effluent treatment, and the trickling filter or biological aerated filter (BAF) is an 
alternative, permitting a 34-44% dye-colour removal for different hi gh dyeing loads of 
industrial effluents. The main microorganisms contributing to biodegradation of organic 
compounds are bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis , Aeromonas Hydrophilia , Bacillus cetreus , 
Klebsiella pneunomoniae , Acetobacter liquefaciens , Pseudomonas  species, Pagmentiphaga kullae , 
Sphingomonas , etc.), fungi (e.g., white-rot fungi: Phanerochaete chrysosporium , Hirschioporus 
larincinus , Inonotus hispidus , Phlebia tremellosa , Coriolus versicolor , etc.), algae (e.g. Chlorella  
and oscillotoria  species) etc. Moreover, some bacteria, white-rot fungi, mixed microbial 
c u l t u r e s  f r o m  a  w i d e  v a r i e t y  o f  h a b i t a t s  a r e  f o u n d  t o  b e  a b l e  t o  d e g r a d e  d y e s  u s i n g  
enzimes, such as lignin peroxidases (LiP), manganese dependent peroxid ases (MnP), 
H2O2-producing enzime such as glucose-1-ox idase and glucose-2-oxidase, along with 
laccase, and a phenoloxidase. Biological aerate d filters involve the growth of an organism 
on inert media that are held stationary duri ng normal operation an d exposed to aeration. 
In aerobic conditions, the mono- and dioxygena se enzymes catalyse the incorporation of 
dissolved oxygen into the aromatic ring of  organic compounds prior to ring fission. 
Although azo dyes are aromatic compounds, their nitro and sulfonic groups are quite 
recalcitrant to aerobic bacterial degradation (Dos Santos et al., 2004). However, in the 
presence of specific oxygen-catalysed enz ymes called azo reductases, some aerobic 
bacteria are able to reduce azo compounds and produce aromatic amines (Stolz, 2001).  
The batch experiments with aerobic activated sludge confirmed the biodegradability of 
sulphonated azo dyes. Only aerobic degradation of the azo dyes is possible by azo  
reduction (i.e. high colour removal (>90%) of Red RBN azo dye-containing effluents (3000 
mg/L) working with Aeromonas hydrophilla  in the specific optimal conditions of pH (5.5-
10), temperature (20 °-38°C), and time (8 days)), and mineralization does not occur. The 
www.intechopen.comOrganic Pollutants Ten Years After  
the Stockholm Convention – Envi ronmental and Analytical Update 
 82
subsequential anaerobic and aerobic bioreactor was able to complet ely remove the 
sulphonated azo dye (i.e. MY10) at a maximum loading rate of 210 mg/L per day (Tan et 
al., 2000). The degradation of azo dyes (i.e. Acid Red 151; Basic Blue 41; Basic Red 46, 16; 
Basic Yellow 28, 19) in an aerobic biofilm system indicated 80% colour removal 
(Anjaneyulu et al., 2005). The improvement of  dye biodegradation performance (i.e. >90% 
colour removal) are made by adding activated carbon (PAC) or bentonite in aeration tank.  
4.3.2 Anaerobic biological treatment 
Anaerobic biodegradation of azo and other wate r-soluble dyes is mainly reported as an 
oxidation-reduction reaction with hydrogen, an d formation of methane, hydrogen sulphide, 
carbon dioxide, other gaseous compounds, and releasing electrons. Th e electrons react with 
the dye reducing the azo bonds, causing the effluent decolourization. Azo dye is considered 
an oxidising agent for the reduced flavin nucleotides of the microbial electron chain, and is 
reduced and decolourized concurrently with reoxidation of the reduced flavin nucleotides 
(Robinson et al., 2001). An additional carbon or ganic source is necessary, such as glucose 
which is a limiting factor in scale set-up  technology application. The azo and nitro- 
components are reduced in anoxic sediments and in the intestinal environment, with 
regeneration of toxic amines (Banat et al.,  1996). A major advantage of anaerobic system 
along with effluent decolourization is the production of biogas, reusable for heat and power 
generation that will reduce energy costs. Sinc e textile industry wastewaters are generally 
discharged at high temperatures (40–70°C), th ermophilic anaerobic treatment could serve as 
an interesting option, especially  when closing process water cycles is considered. Anaerobic 
decolourization of textile effluents (e.g., colour removal of >99% for a Orange II, Black 2HN 
under anaerobic condition, more than 72 h) is not yet well established although successful 
pilot-scale and full-scale plants are very well operating (Tan et al., 2000). Among the 
different studied reactors, anaerobic filter and UASB thermophilic anaerobic reactor gave 
good colour removals, using or not redox mediat or (e.g., antraquinone-2,6, disulphonic acid) 
as catalyst capable of acceleration the colour removal of azo dye-containing wastewaters. 
5. Conclusions  
The dyes are natural and synthetic compounds that make the world more beautiful through 
coloured products but are also considered as pollutants of some water resources.  
The textile sector will continue to be vitally im portant in the area of water conservation due 
to its high consumption of water resources, and its individual or combined effluents’ 
treatments for no environmental pollution generation (i.e. polluting colourants). 
The satisfaction of both discharge criteria for sewerage systems, watercourses and textile 
reuse standards within economically viable lim its implies critical analyses of industrial 
effluents (total wastewater and raw reusable stream characterisation) and removal of all 
pollutants from final effluents. The special category of organic pollutants - textile organic 
dyes - must respect the strict limits in final effluents discharged or not in natural water 
resources. This fact imposes the colour and/or  dye removal from final effluents (especially 
industrial effluents).   
Dye removal from textile effluents in controlled conditions and strict reproductibility is an 
environmental issue achievable by applicatio n of adequate mechano-physico-chemical and 
also biological treatment procedures.

wide range of organic chemicals (industrial formula tions, plant protection products, pharmaceuticals a nd
personal care products, etc.) still poses the highe st priority environmental hazard. The broadening of
knowledge of organic pollutants (OPs) environmental  fate and effects, as well as the decontamination
techniques, is accompanied by an increase in signif icance of certain pollution sources (e.g. sewage sl udge and
dredged sediments application, textile industry), a ssociated with a potential generation of new danger s for
humans and natural ecosystems. The present book add resses these aspects, especially in the light of Or ganic
Pollutants risk assessment as well as the practical  application of novel analytical methods and techni ques for
removing OPs from the environment. Providing analyt ical and environmental update, this contribution ca n be
particularly valuable for engineers and environment al scientists.
