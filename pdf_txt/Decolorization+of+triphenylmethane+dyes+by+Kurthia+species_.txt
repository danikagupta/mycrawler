DECOLOURIZATION OF TRIPHENYLMETHANE DYES
AND ECOTOXICITY OF THEIR END PRODUCTS
Common usage of dyes is always connected with pollution of surface water deposits. The goal of
the research was to investigate th e capability of bacteria and fungi as dyes decolourizing agents. The
ecotoxicity of decolourization products was tested with Daphnia magna and Lemna minor . Accord-
ing to ACE 89/BE 2/D3 Final Report Commission EC, dye control samples were classified as toxic.High decolourization effectiveness was not always connected with detoxification. Crystal violet wasthe most difficult dye to remove (27–76% deco lourization) and brilliant green, the easiest
(62.5–88.6%). Thymol blue and cresol red were easily removed by fungi (>80%) and poorly by bac-teria (<30%). Decolourization of these dyes was mostly connected with an increase of toxicity.
1. INTRODUCTION
Triphenylmethane (TPH) dyes are synthetic  aromatic water-soluble organic color-
ants used by a wide number of industries [1 ]–[3]. The coloured effluents lead to pol-
lution of surface water deposits. Dyes may affect photosynthetic activity in waterbecause they reduce light penetration, cause deficiency of oxygen and deterioration of
life conditions [4]. The majority of dyes are highly toxic and mutagenic. Synthetic
origin and complex aromatic structure make  them more resistant to biodegradation
[1], [3], [5]–[7]. Bacteria and fungi are well known organisms with high potential for
degradation of different pollutants, using different metabolic pathways. It is welldocumented that the effectiveness of degr adation depends on the dye structure, con-
centration, adaptation of microorganisms, their activity and biomass concentration
[7], [8]. Decolourization process of TPH is  mainly based on sorption and/or biotrans-
formation. The well known bacterial strains hi ghly capable of colour removing are as
follows: Pseudomonas  sp., Bacillus sp., Kurthia  sp., Shewanella  sp., Aeromonas hy-
drophila , and Desulfovibrio  sp. [1], [3], [7]. Various fungal strains, e.g. Pseudozyma

rugulosa , Candida krusi,  Rhodotorulla  sp., Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Funalia
trogi, Coriolus versicolor, and Cyathus species , can decolourize effluents as well [1],
[3], [6], [9].
Biological processes are not  always connected with de toxification of pollutants.
Especially cleavage of aromatic rings can lead to products more toxic than initial
compounds. Evaluation of the toxicity of TP H biotransformation products seems to be
very important step before the applicati on of any biotechnology to ensure environ-
mental safety.
The goal of the research was to determine bacterial and fungal TPH-degradation
and detoxification capabilities. Toxicity tests were done with Daphnia magna  and
Lemna minor .
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
The triphenylomethane dyes used in this study can be itemized as follows: brilliant
green (BG), crystal violet (CV), thymol bl ue (TB) and cresol red (CR). Bacterial
strains used in the experiment were isol ated from municipal sewage on the Bushnell–
Hass medium with naphthalene as a car bon source (0.25% w/v). Four of the most
active bacterial strains were used in expe riment and identified according to API 20NE
and API 20E as: Chryseomonas luteola  (A3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (B2), Burk-
holderia cepacia  (B3). Strain A1 was not identifie d. Fungal strains were isolated by
means of tissue culture method: Polyporus picipes  (RWP17) and Trametes versicolor
(L4), Clitocybe dealbata  (RWP1) and Morchella  sp. (SM).
Colour removal test was performed in tubes filled with 10 cm3 of the Kimura
medium [10]. The control samples and samples inoculated with 1 cm3 of bacterial
or fungal suspension were done in triplicat e. Inoculum was prepared in physiologi-
cal salt from 48 h bacterial slants and 72 h fungal cultures. Biomass samples were
cultivated at 26 °C (bacterial biomass for 48 h and fungal biomass for 5 days). Two
modifications were used: alive biomass fo r estimation of biodegradation effective-
ness and autoclaved biomass (121 °C, 1.5 atm. for 20 minutes) for estimation of
sorption effectiveness. Dyes were steriliz ed by filtration (millipore cellulose filters
∅ 0.20 μm) and then added to samples. Dye concentration in each sample was
0.05 g/dm3.
After 7 days of experiment the samples were centrifuged (10000 rpm for 15 min)
and the absorbance of the supernatant obtained was measured. The wavelength wasexperimentally determined with UV VI S Spectrophotometer (H P Diode Array Spec-
trophotometer 8452A) as the wave  with maximal absorbance.
Both sorption ( S) and dye removal by living biomass ( R) were calculated accord-
ing to the following formulae: S[%] = (( C – Sa)/C)⋅100% and R[%] = (( C – Sna)/
C)⋅100%; where C – the concentration of dye in control sample (mg), Sa – the residueDecolourization of triphenylmethane dyes 163
concentration of dye in autoclaved samples (mg), Sna – the residue concentration of
dye in samples with living biomass (mg).
The zootoxicity test was done according to  OECD 202 and that of phytotoxicity–
according to OECD Lemna  sp. growth inhibition test No. 221. TU a (acute toxic unit)
was determined for both tests. Samples we re classified according to ACE 89/BE 2/D3
Final Report Commission EC. The toxicity of natural bacterial and fungal products on
the Kimura medium was also evaluated.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Triphenylmethane dyes are resistant to biodegradation because of their aromatic
structure and many functional groups. Meta bolic pathways of dyes transformations
may be characteristics of each group of micr oorganisms. Sometimes biological proc-
esses are connected with formation of toxi c intermediates. Environmental safety de-
mands both pollutant removal and their det oxication. The valuation of decolourization
effect should be related to ecotoxicity a ssessment. By now most of the decolouriza-
tion projects were concentrated mainly on colour removal.
Decolourization effectiveness as well as t oxicity of the dyes studied and the final
products of their biotransformation depended on the kind of the strain used and on the
structure of the dye tested (figures 1–4 and the table). Such corelations are well
documented in literature [1], [11]–[16].

Dye decolourization by microorganisms may take place in two ways: either by ad-
sorption or degradation. Sorption is frequen tly the first step of biodegradation proc-
ess. Visual changes of the biomass colour can suggest what is the way of decolouri-
zation [12], [14], [15] , [17]. Decolourization effectiv eness and toxicity of crystal
violet samples with bacteria and fungi ar e shown in figure 1. Higher elimination of
crystal violet was observed in the samples with fungal strains. This removal rangedfrom 64% for strain L4 up to 75.9% for st rain RWP17. Sorption was also high: from
59.7 (RWP17) up to 70.4% (RWP1). Strain RW P17 biodegraded CV with the highest
efficiency (75.9%). Removal of CV by  bacterial strains was lower (26.8–42%) but
their contribution to biologi cal processes was higher than that observed in fungal
samples. Crystal violet is cytotoxin and m itotoxin commonly used in medicine [3], but
there is little description of the properties of  the metabolic products of this dye. The
most effective were strains: A3 – Chryseomonas luteola  (42% removal and only 7.2%
sorption) and B2 – Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (40.5% removal and 28.2% sorption).
Also Burkholderia cepacia  (B3) fairly effectively removed CV, and sorption consti-
tuted only 7.2% of its removal. TU values after the process differed, depending on the
strain tested. Bacterial and fungal stra ins did not produce toxins on a pure Kimura
medium. Bacterial products of decolouriza tion proved to be zootoxic. The class of
toxicity of the control sample either with dye or with bacterial intermediates was the
same (IV class). The intermediates of fungal  strains were less toxic than dye (except
SM strain) which manifested itself as the change of toxicity class from IV to III. De-colourization products of bacterial strains (except B3 intermediates) as well as the
control sample with dye were not toxic to Lemna minor . The phytotoxicity of fungal
samples increased, hence they could be found in the III class of toxicity, which was
probably connected with the mouldling of Lemna minor . In this case, it is impossible
to properly estimate the toxicity of intermediates.Decolourization of triphenylmethane dyes 165
Fig. 2. Removal of brilliant green by bacterial and fungal strains and TU value
for Daphnia magna  and Lemna minor
Brilliant green removal and changes in toxicity of samples are shown in figure 2.
Decolourization effectiveness was better for bacterial strains, but high BG removal
was connected with an increase in sample zootoxicity (TU=13.7 in control and 23.3for A3 and 63.7 for B3). The control sample and the bacterial samples were in thesame class of toxicity (IV). The samples with bacteria were phytotoxic (III class oftoxicity), apart from the sample with A3 st rain whose toxicity was the same as that of
the control with dye. Chryseomonas luteola  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  were again
the most effective in BG removal which ranged from 79.3% (A1) up to 88.6% (A3).
Sorption was not practically observed for B3  strain (0.7%) and was the highest for A3
(50.2%). The B2 and B3 strains made the gr eatest contribution to biological BG de-
colourization (72.3 and 79.2%, respectively). Im pressive results were also obtained by
other authors for Bacillus subtilis , Aeromonas hydrofilla , Klebsiella pneumoniae ,
Proteus mirabilis  and Pseudomonas cepacia  [11]. K
UMAR  SANI [1] reported that the
more complex the chemical structure of dye, the lower the rate of TPH removal by
Kurthia sp. In samples with the dyes concentration of 10 μM, after 30-min incubation
a colour removal ranged from 8% for stru cturally complicated ethyl violet to 100%
for structurally simple brilliant green.
In fungal samples, as in the case of crystal violet, highly effective sorption of BG
and a decrease in sample zootoxicity were observed. Two strains were active in sam-ple detoxification (TU for RWP 17 was 3.5 and for SM was 8.0 – III class of toxicity).
The phytotoxicity of fungal samples was high (III class) and r eached even IV class for
strain L4. The most active in colour removal were strains SM and L4 (76.65 and75.8%, respectively) and the least effective was strain RWP17 ( 62.5%). A significant
difference in a colour removal due to so rption and biological removal was observed
only for strain L4 (33.8%). Numerous white rot fungi were highly effective in the
removal of dyes. A special attention is paid  to the processes of the white rot of woodE. Z ABŁOCKA -GODLEWSKA et al. 166
carried out by Pchanerochaete chrysosporium  and Trametes  sp. [5], [6], [14], [15],
[17]–[20]. P. chrysosporium  t e s t e d  b y  R ADHA  [17] removed 95% of methyl violet
during 120 h. Six of seven fungal strain s tested decolourized 99–100% of brilliant
green during one week. T YCHANOWICZ  [21] proved that Pleurotus pulmonaris  is able
to remove 93% of methyl violet for 6 days. The process conditions affect the activityof ligninolytic enzymes, hence they determ ine its efficiency [5 ], [17], [20], [21].

Thymol blue (figure 3) and cresol red (fi gure 4) were removed more effectively by
fungal strains than by bacterial strains. Fungal strains had a great ability to sorpb
dyes. The highest delcolourization of thymol  blue was in the samples with strains
RWP1, RWP17 and SM (about 95%), wh ile sorption reached 89.7–93%. Only the
strain L4 was not so active (31.4% removal) . The zootoxicity of process products was
not higher than that noticed in the control with dye. Finally the class of toxicity was
the same (III). High phytotoxicity was observed for strain RWP1 and again for L4 (IVclass in contrast to non-toxic control). The effectiveness of bacterial decolourization
was very low. No dye removal by strains A1 and B3 was observed (4.6 and 2.7%,respectively). Strains A3 and B2 eliminat ed 29.1% and 17.7% of colour, respectively.
The dye tested was removed only by biode gradation (sorption was not observed).
Biological processes increased the sample toxicity to Daphnia magna  (from III class
in control to IV class of toxicity in  samples with bacteria) as well as to Lemna minor
(from I to III class of toxicity).
Cresol red was removed mainly by sorp tion. Decolourization was higher in the
samples with fungal strains than in those with bacterial ones. The most effective was
L4 strain (97.9%) and the lowest removal was observed in the samples with strains
RWP17 and SM (about 75%). The removal by sorption was similar to the removal byliving biomass. After the end of experiment the toxicity of the samples with fungi washigher than that of the control with dye. An increase of toxicity was observed also for
bacterial strains. In the test with Daphnia magna  and in the test with Lemna minor , IV
and III/II classes of toxicity were obtained, respectively. Strain B3 did not removeCR. The highest decolourization was observe d in the samples with strain B2 (26.4%
removal and 22.9% sorption). The differences  between the effec tiveness of sorption
and biological removal were not signifficant,  but changes in sample toxicity can sug-
gest that a real contributi on of biodegradation to CFR removal is bigger than can be
calculated from these values.
The effectiveness of colour removal for all dyes tested was connected with dye
structure and the presence of functional gr oups. In the case of cresol red, sulphonic
group could be responsible for its lower biodegradability. The influence of dye struc-ture on decolourization effectiveness was proved by A
N [12]. The bacterial strain
tested, i.e. Citrobacter  sp., removed faster and more effectively structurally simpler
crystal violet and methyl red than more complicated genthian violet, malachit green
and brilliant green. Similar dependence was also reported by T YCHANOWICZ  [21],
SHARMA  [16], J ANG [13] and K UMAR  SANI [1].
4. SUMMARY
High effectiveness of dye decolourization was not always connected with a reduc-
tion of dye toxicity. Crystal violet was the most resistant dye (its decolourization wasE. Z ABŁOCKA -GODLEWSKA et al. 168
on the level of 27–76%). A lower removal of CV was associated with a decrease in
sample toxicity. High decolourization of brilliant green by bacteria (79.3–88.6%)
could be related to toxicity increase. Lo wer effectiveness of fungal process (62.5–
76.6%) was connected with toxicity decrease.  Thymol blue and cresol red turned out
to be resistant to degradation by bacteria  (<30% removal). The transformtion of these
dyes led to an increase in sample toxicity . Fungal strains decolourized both dyes with
high effectiveness (>80%) connected  with the rise of toxicity.
