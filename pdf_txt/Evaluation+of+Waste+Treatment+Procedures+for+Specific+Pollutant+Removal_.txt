The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, through its Office of Water, has funded, managed, and
collaborated in the development of this guidance, which was prepared under order 7W-1235-NASX toAquatic Sciences Consulting; order 5W-2260-NASA to EA Engineering, Science and Technology, Inc.; andcontracts 68-03-3431, 68-C8-0 02, and 68-C2- 0102 to Parsons Engineering Science, Inc.  It has been
subjected to the Agency's peer and administrative review and has been approved for publication.
The statements in this document are intended solely as guidance.  This document is not intended, nor can it
be relied on, to create any rights enforceable by any party in litigation with the United States.  EPA and Stateofficials may decide to follow the guidance provided in this document, or to act at variance with theguidance, based on an analysis of site-specific circumstances.  This guidance may be revised without publicnotice to reflect changes in EPA policy.iiiForeword
This document is intended to provide guidance to permittees, permit writers, and consultants on the general
approach and procedures for conducting toxicity reduction evaluations (TREs) at municipal wastewatertreatment plants.  TREs are important tools for Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) to use to identifyand reduce or eliminate toxicity in a wastewater discharge.  TREs may be required by the discharger'sNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit or through state or federal enforcementactions.  Dischargers can use the guidance to evaluate the nature and sources of effluent toxicity before aTRE becomes a regulatory requirement.  Whether the TRE is voluntary or mandated, this guidance can behelpful in preparing and executing a plan to address effluent toxicity. This guidance describes the general approaches that have been successfully used in municipal TREs.  EachTRE will be different; therefore, the strategy for conducting TREs should be tailored to address site-specificconditions.  The components of a TRE may include the collection and review of pertinent data; an evaluationof the treatment facility to identify conditions that may contribute to effluent toxicity; identification ofeffluent toxicants using toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) procedures (USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1993a,1993b, 1996); location of the sources of toxicants and/or toxicity using chemical analysis or  refractorytoxicity assessment (RTA) procedures; and the evaluation, selection, and implementation of toxicity controlmeasures.  Dischargers are encouraged to develop a TRE plan that describes the in itial components to
perform in the TRE.  Following initial testing, the  results can be used to provide direction for further testingto identify the cause(s) and source(s) of toxicity and evaluate and select methods for toxicity control.
This document is an update of the municipal TRE protocol that was published in 1989 (USEPA, 1989a).
Much experience has been gained since 1989, including the use of a number of freshwater and estuarine/marine species in acute and chronic TRE studies and the development of additional procedures for TIE andRTA studies. In most cases, the approaches and methods described in the municipal TRE protocol have beenvalidated through TRE studies and other municipal TREs (Amato et al., 1992; Bailey et al., 1995; Botts etal., 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994; Collins et al., 1991; F illmore et al., 1990; Lankford and Eckenfelder, 1990;
Morris et al., 1990, 1992).  Important lessons have been learned and this information has been incorporatedin this guidance where possible.  Additions to this guidance include considerations in evaluating theoperation and performance of current publicly owned treatment works (POTW) technology, descriptions ofcurrent TIE procedures for acute and short-term chronic toxicity (USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1993a, 1993b,1996), updated methods for tracking sources of acute and chronic toxicity in POTW sewer collectionsystems, and additional recent case studies on acute and chronic TREs using freshwater and estuarine/marinespecies.  Information is also provided on sampling requirements, equipment and facilities, qualityassurance/quality control, and health and safety.
The updated TIE guidance procedures are important tools for conducting TREs including Toxicity
Identification Evaluation: Characterization of Chronically Toxic Effluents, Phase I (USEPA, 1992a),
Methods for Aquatic Toxicity Identification Evaluations: Phase I Toxicity Characterization Procedures,Second Edition  (USEPA, 1991a), Marine Toxicity Identification Evaluation (TIE) Guidance Document,
Phase I (USEPA, 1996) , Methods for Aquatic Toxicity Identification Evaluations: Phase II Toxicity
Identification Procedures for Samples Exhibiting Acute and Chronic Toxicity (USEPA, 1993a), and Methods
for Aquatic Toxicity Identification Evaluations: Phase III Toxicity Confirmation Procedures for SamplesExhibiting Acute and Chronic Toxicity  (USEPA, 1993b).  The acute and chronic whole e ffluent toxicity
testing manuals should also be reviewed during the TRE process (USEPA 1993c, 1994a, 1994b, 1995). Thesemanuals describe procedures for the toxicity tests that are the core of the TREs.ivContents

Introduction
Background
The Clean Water Act (CWA) (United States Federal
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments, Public Law92-500 of 1972) prohibits the discharge of “toxicpollutants in toxic amounts.”  In the CWA, themechanism for regulating discharges to the Nation’swaterways is the National Pollutant DischargeElimination System (NPDES).  Permits issued underNPDES may contain effluent limits and otherrequirements based on ambient water quality standardsfor the protection of aquatic life and human health.The water quality-based approach applies criteria forboth chemical specific parameters and whole effluenttoxicity to ensure that toxic pollutants are controlledand water quality standards are maintained ( Federal
Register 23868, 1989).  This integrated approach to
water quality protection is described in detail inUSEPA’s Technical Support Document for Water
Quality-Based Toxics Control  (hereafter referred to as
the TSD, 1991b).
“Whole effluent toxicity” refers to the results of acute
and chronic aquatic toxicity tests used to monitordischarges to surface waters.  Acute toxicity is ameasure of primarily lethal effects that occur over ashort period of time (i.e., 96 hours or less).  Chronictoxicity refers to sublethal effects, such as inhibition offertilization, growth, and reproduction that occur overa longer exposure period (e.g., 7 days).  Acute andchronic effects to aquatic species are measured usingstandard procedures (40 CFR 136.3) as specified inNPDES permits.  USEPA has published manuals thatdescribe the toxicity test methods for freshwater andestuarine/marine organisms (USEPA 1993c, 1994a,1994b, 1995).  On October 26, 1995, USEPApromulgated a final rule under the CWA that addswhole effluent toxicity testing methods to the list ofnationally applicable methods in 40 Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Part 136.  These methods can beaccessed electronically along with all other approved
analytical methods on CD-ROM (USEPA, 1997).
Effluents from permitted facilities are monitored, and
where a reasonable potential exists to exceed numerictoxicity criteria, NPDES permit limits for wholeeffluent toxicity are established (40 CFR122.44(d)(1)(iv)).  Whole effluent toxicity limits mayalso be established where there is reasonable potentialto exceed a narrative toxicity criterion in the receivingwater (40 CFR 122.44(a)(1)(v)).  A toxicity reductionevaluation (TRE) may be used to identify and reduceor eliminate sources of effluent toxicity whether or notthere are whole effluent toxicity limits in the NPDESpermits.  For example, where a permittee has no wholeeffluent toxicity limits in its current permit butdiscovers a toxicity problem, it may use a TRE toreduce or eliminate effluent toxicity, ensure that thereis no reasonable potential that its discharge will exceedtoxicity criteria and possibly obviate the need forwhole effluent toxicity limits in a subsequent permit.On the other hand, if a permit contains whole effluenttoxicity monitoring requirements or limits andunacceptable toxicity is observed, the permittingauthority may require the permittee to perform a TREthrough special conditions in the permit or anenforcement action.
The TSD defines a TRE as “a site specific study
conducted in a stepwise process designed to i dentify
the causative agents of effluent toxicity, isolate thesources of toxicity, evaluate the effectiveness oftoxicity control options, and then confirm the reductionin effluent toxicity” (USEPA, 1991b).  USEPA hasdeveloped procedures that can be used to conductTREs (USEPA 1989a, 1989b, 1991a, 1992a, 1993a,1993b, 1996).
This document represents the first update of USEPA’s
Toxicity Reduction Evaluation Protocol for Municipal2Wastewater Treatment Plants  (1989a).  This guidance
provides a general framework for conducting TREs atpublicly owned treatment works (POTWs) anddescribes the available methods and procedures thatexperience to date has shown to be most useful.  It isdesigned for POTW staff, consultants, and regulatoryagency staff who are implementing TREs to identifyand reduce or eliminate sources of effluent toxicity.Where possible, POTW staff are encouraged to use theguidance before the discharge of whole effluenttoxicity is subject to regulatory review and action.
This guidance presents methods and procedures that
are useful to:
• Develop and implement a TRE plan.
• Evaluate the results and data generated during the
TRE.
• Develop a sound scientific and engineering basis
for the selection and implementation of toxicitycontrol methods.
This guidance s upports the strategy desribed in the
TSD (USEPA, 1991b) for integrated toxics controlusing whole effluent toxicity and pollutant specificlimits.  It is well recognized that while POTWs mayachieve effluent limits for conventional pollutants, thedischarge of effluent toxicity, volatilization of toxicmaterials, and contamination of sewage sludges canstill occur.  The focus of this guidance is the reductionof whole effluent toxicity at municipal wastewatertreatment plants.
The methods and decision points that comprise a TRE
are described in the context of an overall generalizedapproach.  Each municipality must address regulatoryissues and treatment operations that are unique to eachPOTW; therefore, not all components of this guidancewill apply in every case.  POTW staff may also selectcomponents to address specific questions about thecauses and sources of effluent toxicity; however, thedecision to choose a particular step should be based ontechnically sound information.  Given the site-specificnature of TREs, POTW staff will need to develop aTRE plan that describes the overall approach andcomponents of the guidance to be implemented.
In most cases, the approaches and methods described
in the TRE protocol (USEPA, 1989a) have beenvalidated by USEPA TRE research studies and othermunicipal TREs (Amato et al., 1992; Bailey et al.,1995; Botts et al., 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994; Collins etal., 1991; Fillmore et al., 1990; Lankford and
Eckenfelder, 1990; Morris et al., 1990, 1992).Appendix A provides the original case studies from themunicipal TRE protocol (USEPA, 1989a).  Additionalexamples of successful TREs are presented inAppendices B through H of this guidance.  The TREguidance includes information learned from thesestudies.  Major changes include:
• Information on toxicants commonly found in
POTW effluents and the conditions that influencetheir toxicity (Section 2).
• Considerations in evaluating the operation and
performance of POTWs with respect to conditionsthat may contribute to effluent toxicity.  Additionalinformation is provided on operations review ofbiological nutrient removal (BNR) processes(Section 3).
• A brief description of the use of updated toxicity
identification evaluation (TIE) procedures foracute and short-term chronic toxicity (Section 4).The reader is referred to USEPA’s guidance onTIE procedures for further details (USEPA 1991a,1992a, 1993a, 1993b, 1996).
• Refined step-by-step guidance for tracking sources
of acute and chronic toxicity in POTW collectionsystems (Section 5).
• Additional recent TRE case studies that describe
approaches for identifying the causes and sourcesof acute and chronic effluent toxicity and practicalmethods for toxicity reduction (Appendices Bthrough H).
The methods and procedures described herein will
continue to be updated and refined based on the resultsof further studies.
Professional judgment is required in selecting the
appropriate steps for identifying toxicants and forevaluating options for controlling effluent toxicity.USEPA has developed TIE procedures to use as toolsfor TRE studies.  These TIE manuals (USEPA 1991a,1992a, 1993a, 1993b, 1996) describe procedures forcharacterization, identification, and confirmation ofeffluent toxicants.  TIE procedures are a basiccomponent of the municipal TRE and the USEPAguidance manuals should be obtained and reviewed
prior to implementing a TRE.  USEPA also hasdeveloped a generalized protocol for conductingindustrial TREs (USEPA, 1989b).3TRE Goals and Objectives
It is the responsibility of POTW staff to conduct a TRE
to identify and reduce or eliminate sources of effluenttoxicity and to fully comply with applicable toxicity-based NPDES permit limits.  The goal of the TRE maybe to achieve compliance with a whole effluent toxicitylimit; however, POTW staff are encouraged to use theguidance to evaluate effluent toxicity before it becomesa regulatory issue.  The TRE goal and implementationschedule should be clearly defined with the regulatoryauthority as part of the preparation of the TRE plan.The regulatory authority will review the TRE plan andcarefully monitor the progress of the TRE, providingdirection as needed.
The following objectives may be defined to accomplish
the TRE goal:
• Evaluate the operation and performance of the
POTW to identify and correct treatmentdeficiencies contributing to effluent toxicity (e.g.,operations problems, chemical additives, orincomplete treatment).
• Identify the compounds causing effluent toxicity.• Trace the effluent toxicants and/or toxicity to their
sources (e.g., i ndustrial, commercial, or domestic).
• Evaluate, select, and implement toxicity reduction
methods or technologies to control effluenttoxicity (i.e., in-plant or pretreatment controloptions).
These objectives are applied to meet the TRE goal of
compliance with regulatory requirements.
Components of the Municipal TRE
A generalized flow diagram for a TRE program isillustrated in Figure 1-1.  A brief description of eachmajor TRE component is presented below along withthe section number in the guidance in which additionalinformation is provided.
Information and Data Acquisition (Section 2)
The first step in a TRE is the collection of informationand analytical data pertaining to effluent toxicity.  Thisinformation includes data on the operation andperformance of the POTW, such as plant designcriteria and discharge monitoring reports (DMRs), anddata from the POTW’s pretreatment program, such asindustrial waste survey (IWS) information, permitapplications, and industrial user compliance reports.The POTW performance data and pretreatmentprogram information are used in the second stage ofthe TRE, as described below.
Facility Performance Evaluation (Section 3)
Operations and performance data can be reviewed in a
POTW performance evaluation to indicate possible in-plant sources of toxicity or operational deficiencies thatmay be contributing to the effluent toxicity.  If atreatment deficiency is causing noncompliance withconventional pollutant permit limits, studies should beconducted to evaluate treatment modifications beforeproceeding further in the TRE.  These studies s hould
evaluate the toxicity reduction that can be achieved bycorrecting treatment deficiencies.  If plant performanceis not a principal cause of toxicity or treatmentmodifications do not reduce effluent toxicity, a logicalnext step is to identify the cause(s) of toxicity usingTIE procedures.
Pretreatment program data also can be gathered to
prepare a data base on the wastewaters discharged tothe POTW collection system.  These data can be usedin the latter stages of the TRE to assist in tracking thesources of toxicity and/or toxicants that arecontributing to POTW effluent toxicity.
Toxicity Identification Evaluation (Section 4)
This section provides a brief overview of the TIEprocedures.  TIE procedures are available to evaluatethe causes of acute and short-term chronic toxicity.When implementing a TIE, the reader is advised toconsult USEPA’s TIE procedures for freshwaterspecies (1991a, 1 992a, 1993a, 1993b) or estuarine/
marine species (1996).  The generic TIE protocol isperformed in three phases: toxicity characterization(Phase I), toxicant identification (Phase II), andtoxicant confirmation (Phase III).  Phase I characterizesthe types of effluent toxicants by testing the toxicity ofaliquots of effluent samples that have undergone
bench-top manipulation (e .g., pH adjustment,
filtration).  An evaluation of common POTW effluenttoxicants such as ammonia, chlorine, andorganophosphate insecticides may be included inPhase I.  Phases II and III involve further treatments inconjunction with chemical analyses to identify andconfirm the compounds causing effluent toxicity.USEPA’s Phase II and III procedures ( 1993a, 1993b)
for freshwater species are generally applicable forestuarine/marine species.

commercial facilities.  Two types of source evaluationstudies may be performed: chemical tracking ortoxicity-based tracking.
Chemical-specific tracking is recommended when the
POTW effluent toxicants have been identified andconfirmed in the TIE, and can be readily traced to theresponsible sewer dischargers.  Toxicity tracking isused when TIE data indicate the type of effluenttoxicant, but the specific toxicant(s) is not identified.Toxicity tracking involves treating the sewer samplesin a bench-scale treatment simulation prior to toxicitymeasurements to account for the toxicity removal thatis provided by the POTW.
The sampling strategy for toxicity source evaluations
involves two tiers.  Tier I focuses on sampling andanalysis of the main sewer lines in the collectionsystem.  Tier II involves testing sewer lines andindirect dischargers upstream of the main linesidentified as being toxic in Tier I.  This tiered approachcan be used to identify the contributors of toxicityand/or toxicants by eliminating segments of thecollection system that do not contribute toxicity/toxicants.
Toxicity Control Evaluation (Section 6)
Using the results of each of the above TRE elements,alternatives for effluent toxicity reduction are evaluatedand the most feasible option(s) is selected forimplementation.  Effluent toxicity may be controlledeither through pretreatment regulations or in-planttreatment modifications or additions.  In some cases,several control methods may be required to achieve thedesired toxicity reduction.  Selection of control optionsis usually based on technical and cost criteria.
If the toxicity source evaluation is successful in
locating the sources that are contributing the POTWeffluent toxicants, local limits can be developed andimplemented.  If in-plant control appears to be afeasible approach, treatability testing may be used toevaluate methods for optimizing existing treatmentprocesses and to assess options for additionaltreatment.
Toxicity Control Implementation (Section 7)
The toxicity control method or technology isimplemented and follow-up monitoring is conducted toensure that the control method achieves the TREobjectives and meets permit limits.Limitations of the TRE Guidance
This guidance describes procedures for evaluating andimplementing controls for reduction of whole effluenttoxicity.  Procedures for the reduction of toxicpollutants in residuals, biosolids, and air emissions atPOTWs are not discussed.  The reader may consult theStandards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge(40 CFR Part 503) regarding the control of toxicmaterials in biosolids.
The municipal TRE guidance was developed based on
the results and findings of TRE and TIE studies.  Thefollowing limitations have been identified in thesestudies:
• Intermittent or ephemeral toxicity may be
challenging to characterize using TIE/TREprocedures.  In these cases, modifications to TREprocedures may be needed to achieve the bestpossible results (see Sections 4 and 5).Discussions with the regulatory authority also mayhelp to identify the most appropriate approach forcomplying with effluent toxicity requirements.
• As described in this guidance, alternative
procedures are available if traditional methodssuch as TIE testing are not successful.  AdditionalTRE procedures, especially tools for toxicitysource evaluations, have not been widely used, butmay be helpful if careful consideration is given totheir design and application.
• As more TRE studies are completed, more
information is available on the feasibility andeffectiveness of in-plant and pretreatment toxicitycontrol options.  Examples of TREs in whichtoxicity controls have been su ccessfully
implemented are provided in Appendices B, C, D,E, G, and H.
• The TRE guidance is designed to help public
works managers select appropriate toxicity controlapproaches.  As such, it does not discussregulatory procedures that may be useful forassessing the need for, or compliance with,toxicity requirements, such as the determination ofreasonable potential, dilution factors, and permitlimits.  The importance of these procedures in theevaluation of whole effluent toxicity is mentionedin Section 2 and is discussed more fully inUSEPA’s TSD (1991b).6Organization of the TRE Guidance

Information and Data Acquisition
Introduction
The first step in a TRE is to gather all information and
data that may relate to effluent toxicity and that mightprove useful in planning and conducting the TRE.This information can be categorized as POTWtreatment plant data and pretreatment program data.The pertinent POTW information includes historicaleffluent toxicity data  as well as information on thetreatment plant’s design capabilities, treatmentperformance, and operation and maintenance practices.Appropriate pretreatment program information consistsof IWS data, industrial user permits, pretreatmentinspection reports, and monitoring and compliancereports.  If a pretreatment program is not in place,POTW staff may need to collect monitoring data on thePOTW industrial users and, where necessary,appropriate controls should be considered to ensuregood effluent quality.
Background information may provide insight into the
nature of effluent toxicity and can be used to select theinitial steps to take in the TRE.  However, it isimportant not to draw conclusions about the causes and
sources of toxicity in the beginning of the TRE unlesscorroborative testing is performed.  A summary ofinformation recommended for a TRE is provided in thefollowing subsections.
Review of Effluent Toxicity Data
Information and data acquisition should include acareful review of recent effluent toxicity data.  Thisreview should be used to confirm the effluent toxicityresults and the potential to cause adverse instreameffects.  The data also can be used to evaluate generaltoxicity characteristics, such as temporal variability,species sensitivity, and whether the toxicant(s) is fastor slow acting.
In some states, laboratories are required to be certified
to perform toxicity tests.  Toxicity test data reports alsomay be reviewed by regulatory staff to confirm that the
tests meet basic quality assurance/quality control(QA/QC) requirements.  However, this is usually theexception; most state and regional regulatory agenciesdo not have certification programs for toxicity testingand reports may not be formally reviewed.  As aninitial step in the TRE, POTW staff should conduct anindependent review of the toxicity test reports to verifythe quality of the reported data, especially results thathave triggered TRE requirements.
It often is beneficial to develop a profile on the
characteristics of effluent toxicity using the availablehistorical data.  Information on toxicity variability, therelative sensitivity of various test species to theeffluent, and effluent characteristics [e .g., pH,
alkalinity, hardness, conductivity, total residualchlorine (TRC), and dissolved oxygen (DO)] canprovide important clues about the nature of thetoxicity.  These characteristics can be compared toPOTW and pretreatment information to help determineif effluent toxicity may be related to operationalpractices or sewer discharges.  This  information alsocan be used as part of the TIE (Section 4) to helpidentify the causes of effluent toxicity.
The data review may show that some test conditions
such as pH may artificially change during testing.Typically, the pH of toxicity test solutions tends to driftupward over time, which can cause pH sensitivecompounds such as ammonia and metals to exhibittoxicity.  With the consent of the regulatory authority,it may be possible to modify the test procedures tocontrol pH drift (USEPA 1993c and T. Davies,USEPA, Office of Water, Memorandum on
Clarifications Regarding Flexibility in 40 CFR Part136 Whole Effluent Test Methods , April 10, 1996).
Modifications may also be allowed to better reflect therange of temperatures and hardness observed in thereceiving water.  Depending on the temperatures to be8considered, it is recommended to use a different test
species rather than modify the recommendedtemperature range for a given test species.
Prior to a TRE, POTW staff or the regulatory agency
may evaluate the “reasonable potential” for exceedinga toxicity-based water quality standard to determine ifa permit limit is required.  If there is reasonablepotential to cause instream toxicity or contribute to anexcursion above a narrative criterion, a statisticalapproach may be used to calculate a toxicity-basedpermit limit.  This approach may also be applied duringthe course of a TRE to assess compliance with a permitlimit or a water quality standard.  For example,improvements in effluent quality resulting from theTRE could lower effluent toxicity to a point wherethere is no longer a reasonable potential to exceed thepermit limit.  Or, these improvements may reduceeffluent variability.  The reduced variability couldresult in a smaller coefficient of variation (CV), whichwould lessen the potential for excursions above theTRE goal.  The reader is referred to USEPA’s TSD fordetails on these procedures (USEPA, 1991b).
The TSD also discusses the use of dilution, and
particularly the use of high-rate diffusers, in achievingcompliance with toxicity-based water qualitystandards.  The dilution determination, if allowed byapplicable regulations, is one of the first steps incharacterizing the effluent for toxicity-based permitting(USEPA, 1991b).  Public works managers, who areinitiating a TRE, may choose to evaluate theapplication of appropriate mixing zone allowances toeliminate the potential for instream effects.  Ashoreline outfall, for instance, may not qualify for anydilution when determining an acute toxicityrequirement.  Use of a diffuser constructed in deeperwater may allow the effluent to achieve sufficientdilution in the rapid-mixing, near-field area to meetpermit requirements.  Similar results may be obtainedby moving an outfall from a small or intermittentstream, where no dilution is available under low flowconditions, to a larger permanent stream, with greaterdilution.  It should be noted, however, that less costlytoxicity control approaches than outfall relocation maybe identified during the course of the TRE.  Theprocess of selecting the most feasible and practicalcontrol option(s) is described in Section 6 of thisguidance.Toxicants Identified in POTW Effluents
As noted, the occurrence of toxicity and the treatmentprocess operations are unique to each POTW;therefore, the causes of effluent toxicity are likely to bedifferent for each case.  Nonetheless, some toxi cants
have been identified at many POTWs.  A list oftoxicants commonly found in POTW effluents, thelevels of concern, and potential sources is presented inTable 2-1.  The levels of concern are to be used as ageneral guide, not as absolute values .  Due to the site-
specific nature of effluent toxicity, these data areintended only as background information to consider inthe process of conducting a TRE.  It is important tostress that a direct comparison of chemicalconcentrations to toxicity data reported in the literatureoften provides misleading information.  The toxicity ofeffluent cons tituents is affected by many factors
including the effluent matrix and toxicity testconditions.  The most effective way to identify causesof effluent toxicity is by applying the TIE procedures,which are described in Section 4 of this guidance.
Some of the information that can be collected to help
evaluate the contribution of the toxicants to effluenttoxicity is provided in Table 2-1.  Toxicity informationon specific parameters can be obtained from USEPA’sAquatic Information Retrieval Toxicity Data Base(AQUIRE, 1992), TIE manuals (USEPA 1991a,1992a, 1993a, 1993b, 1996), EXtension TOXicologyNETwork (EXTOXNET, 1998),  peer-reviewed journal
articles, and other sources.  AQUIRE information canbe obtained through the National TechnicalInformation Service (NTIS) in Springfield, Virginia, orthrough several commercial vendors.  USEPA’s Mid-Continent Ecology Division (Duluth, Minnesota) willbe offering Internet access to AQUIRE data in early1999 through its Ecotoxicology Database RetrievalSystem (ECOTOX).  The EXtension TOXicologyNETwork is currently available on the Internet athttp://ace.orst.edu/info/extoxnet/.  When reviewingtoxicological data, it is important to ensure that thereferences for the data have been peer-reviewed andthe values given are considered to be accurate.
In some cases, toxicological data may be presented in
toxic units (TUs) instead of in lethal concentrationscausing a 50% mortality in exposed test organisms(LC50) or no observed effect concentrations (NOEC).TUs are the inverse of the percent concentration9Toxicant Type Level of Concern* Potential SourceInformation Needed

† The contribution of effluent constituents such as chlorine, ammonia, organic compounds, metals, and TDS to effluent
toxicity can be most effectively evaluated using the TIE Phase I procedures described in Sections 3 and 4 of this guidanceand the USEPA manuals (1991a, 1992a, 1996).Table 2-1.  Toxicants Identified in POTW Effluents10values and are calculated by dividing 100% by acute or
chronic percent effluent values or chemicalconcentration data.  For example, a chronic TU (TUc)of 2 is equivalent to an NOEC value of 50% effluent(i.e., 100%/50%).  Likewise, if the LC50 of acompound is 20 µg/L, an effluent sample with 100µg/L contains 5 acute TU (TUa) of the compound (i.e.,100 µg/L/20 µg/L).  TU values are helpful inunderstanding the relative contribution of toxicants toeffluent toxicity and are often used in interpreting TIEdata (Section 4).  For example, if one of twocompounds is contributing to effluent toxicity (e.g., 4TUc of compound A and 1.5 TUc of compound B), itmay be possible to focus on controlling the majortoxicant if compliance with the permit limit (e.g., 3TUc) can be achieved.  However, consideration shouldbe given to possible antagonistic effects between thetoxicants such that removal of one toxicant may causethe other toxicant to exhibit greater toxicity.  Anoverview of this is provided in Section 4 and the TIEmanuals (USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1993a, 1993b, 1996)provide thorough guidance.
POTW Design and Operations Data
POTW design and operations information can indicatepossible in-plant sources of toxicity or operationalproblems that might be contributing to treatmentinterferences and the pass through of toxicity.  In thebeginning of the TRE, it is often helpful to brieflyreview the operations and performance of the majorunit treatment processes.  Notes can be added toPOTW data base about initial impressions andpotential problem areas that should be investigatedfurther in the POTW Performance Evaluation (seeSection 3).
The types of POTW data to be gathered include:
• Background information on treatment plant design
and operation.
• Data routinely collected for NPDES DMRs and
treatment process control.
• Existing data on potential effluent toxicants,
including chlorine, ammonia, organophosphateinsecticides, surfactants, metals, and treatmentadditives (e.g., polymers, chlorine, dechlorinationchemicals).
A list of useful POTW data is provided in Table 2-2.The POTW data can be compared to the profile on
effluent toxicity characteristics to determine if toxicitymay be related to operation and performance.  Several
questions can be posed, including:
• Is toxicity apparent during certain operational
events, such as when treatment upsets areobserved, when treatment units are taken offlinefor maintenance, or as a result of other operatingpractices (e.g., excess chlorine addition)?
• Does toxicity exhibit a weekly, monthly, or
seasonal pattern?  For example, if the POTW isoperated to achieve seasonal ammonia removal, istoxicity present in the period when ammoniaremoval is not practiced?  What process controlparameters may be related to toxicity?  Is toxicityapparent with changes in hydraulic and pollutantloadings to the primary sedimentation process,changes in biological treatment parameters[e.g., mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)concentration, DO concentration, sludge volumeindex (SVI), mean cell residence time (MCRT)],changes in filtration rates in filters, or changes inapplication rates of chlorine and dechlorinatingagents?
• Is toxicity apparent when the type and dose of
treatment additives change?  For example, didtoxicity occur when a different polymer or othercoagulant/flocculent aid was used?
In the beginning of the TRE, emphasis should be
placed on effluent concentrations of ammonia andchlorine, which are common toxicants in POTWeffluents (USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1993a, and 1993b).The toxicity of ammonia is dependent on effluentcharacteristics such as the pH, temperature, and salinityof the sample, as well as the sensitivity of the speciesbeing tested.  Therefore, it will be difficult todetermine the toxicity of ammonia based solely on acomparison of literature values to effluentconcentrations.  Likewise, the toxicity of chlorine willdepend on the form of chlorine, which may be in thefree form as chlorine, hypochlorous acid, orhypochlorite ion, or in the combined form aschloroamines or nitrogen trichloride.  The sum of thefree and combined chlorine, termed total residualchlorine or TRC, is matrix dependent.  Chloramines,which are formed by chlorine combining withammonia, can be more toxic than free chlorine(AQUIRE, 1992).
Assessments of the contribution of ammonia, chlorine,
and other compounds to effluent toxicity can be madeusing Table 2-1 as a guide.  As stated in Table 2-1, if111. NPDES permit requirements

should be measured when the sample arrives and whentoxicity tests are initiated because chlorine usuallydissipates rapidly.  If ammonia is a concern, conditionsthat affect its toxicity, including sample pH, should becarefully monitored during toxicity tests.  Thisinformation is necessary to determine the concentrationof the toxic un-ionized form of ammonia (NH
3) in the
toxicity test.  In addition to toxicity data, USEPA’sAQUIRE data base (1992) includes information on theconditions of the toxicity test that may have influencedthe reported toxicity of chemicals of concern.However, not all conditions may be recognized orreported, which may limit the utility for TIE tests.
Surfactants also have been identified as toxicants in
POTW effluents (Diehl and Moore, 1987; Ankley andBurkhard, 1992; Botts et al., 1994).  These studiesfocused on characterizing the type or source ofsurfactants rather than trying to identify the toxicsurfactant compound because analytical methods arenot readily available to detect and quantify surfactantcompounds in complex effluents.  Municipal effluentscontain numerous substances that interfere withsurfactant analysis.  Also, surfactants are actuallymixtures of many homologues and oligomers;therefore, the composition and toxicity of surfactants iscomplex and often variable (USEPA, 1993a).  Oneexception is a class of surfactants, referred to as alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs), that can be analyzed by agas chomatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) (Gigeret al., 1981).  Also, it may be helpful to characterizesurfactants by the nature of their polar segment;surfactants may be classified as nonionic, anionic,cationic, and amphoteric.  Many surfactants tend tosorb to C18 resin and analyses of the methanol extractsfrom solid phase extraction (SPE) columns can help toindicate the type of surfactant causing toxicity(USEPA, 1993a).  The American Public HealthAssociation (1995) describes methods for determininganionic surfactants as MBAS and nonionic surfactantsas CTAS.
The contribution of effluent constituents such as
ammonia and chlorine to effluent toxicity can be mosteffectively evaluated using the TIE proceduresdescribed in Sections 3 and 4.  Non-polar organiccompounds (such as organophosphate insecticides),metals, surfactants, and TDS also can be effectivelyevaluated using these procedures.  In Phase I of theTIE, various sample manipulations and toxicity testsare performed to determine how toxicity is affected by
removing or isolating a particular group of toxicants.These procedures establish a cause and effectrelationship between toxicants and whole effluenttoxicity.  If a toxicant is indicated through Phase Itesting, additional TIE procedures can be applied toidentify (Phase II) and confirm (Phase III) the toxicant(see Section 4).
Treatment additives can be screened by obtaining
toxicity data from product vendors or by performingtoxicity tests on samples that have been treated usingtypical chemical dosages.  If toxicity tests areperformed, it is important to simulate the c onditions
occurring in the treatment process where additives arebeing used because some portion of the additives isusually removed in the treatment process.  Forexample, polymers are largely bound with suspendedsolids in the wastewater being treated and only minoramounts may pass through in the final effluent (Halland Mirenda, 1991).
Once the toxicants are identified, the POTW data will
be useful in evaluating and selecting in-plant toxicitycontrol options (see Section 6).
Pretreatment Program Data
Pretreatment program information may provideevidence that can be used to identify sources oftoxicants or toxicity in the wastewater collectionsystem.  For this reason, pretreatment data should bebriefly reviewed in the beginning of the TRE.  As aninitial step, pretreatment data can be compared to theprofile on POTW effluent toxicity characteristics todetermine if toxicity may be related to a particular typeof discharge.  This review may attempt to answerseveral questions, including:
• What changes in POTW influent characteristics
may be observed during toxic periods (e.g., pH,alkalinity, suspended solids, hardness,conductivity, DO, color)?  Also, does toxicityoccur during changes in hydraulic and pollutantloadings to the POTW?  Can these characteristicsbe related to certain types of discharges?
• Does toxicity occur when treatment upsets are
observed at the POTW?  Can the upsets be relatedto a particular discharge(s)?
• Does toxicity exhibit a weekly, monthly, or
seasonal pattern that may be related to productionschedules of certain industries?  For example, is13toxicity observed when an industry is
manufacturing a particular type of product?  Also,does toxicity abate when the industry is shutdownfor maintenance or holidays?
• If the POTW accepts hauled wastes, is toxicity
apparent when a particular hauler delivers wastes?
Appropriate pretreatment program information to
review includes the data on the industrial users of thePOTW [e.g., industrial manufacturers, ResourceConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) wastedisposers, and Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act(CERCLA) dischargers] and the toxic pollutant data on
the POTW waste streams.  A list of suggestedpretreatment data is shown in Table 2-3.
The POTW pretreatment program data can be
reviewed as part of a Pretreatment Program Review(described in Section 3).  The summarized data may beuseful in locating the sources of toxicants identified inthe TIE (see Section 4).  In cases in which effluenttoxicants are not identified, the pretreatment programdata can be used to develop a sampling and analysisprogram to track sources of toxicity in the collectionsystem (see Section 5).141.

Facility Performance Evaluation
Introduction
POTW treatment deficiencies that cause poor
conventional pollutant removal can have an adverseeffect on toxicity reduction as well.  As an initial stepin the TRE, effluent toxicity data (Table 2-1) andPOTW operations and performance data (Table 2-2)should be evaluated to indicate potential toxicants ofconcern and to identify treatment deficiencies or in-plant sources of toxicity that may be responsible for allor part of the effluent toxicity.  POTW pretreatmentprogram data (Table 2-3) should also be reviewed toindicate possible sources of toxicity and summarizedfor use in later steps of the TRE such as the toxicitysource evaluation (Section 5).
POTW Performance Evaluation
A POTW performance evaluation can be conducted toindicate conventional pollutant treatment deficienciesor in-plant sources of toxicity that may be contributingto effluent toxicity.  Conventional pollutant treatmentdeficiencies include the inability to meet permit limitsfor BOD, TSS, and nutrients.  These deficienciesshould be corrected before initiating a full TREbecause improved treatment also may reduce effluenttoxicity.  In-plant sources of toxicity may be presenteven if the POTW is meeting permit limits forpollutants other than toxicity.  An example of an in-plant source of toxicity includes inadequate solidsseparation in the final clarifier, which may result in thedischarge of toxic material bound to suspended solids.Also, incomplete biological treatment may cause thepass-through of biodegradable toxicants.  Other in-plant sources of toxicity may include treatmentadditives used in toxic am ounts or additives that
contain toxic impurities.   If deficiencies are found in
the POTW performance evaluation, improvements canbe implemented to eliminate the causes of toxicity.Several examples of operating conditions that havecontributed to effluent toxicity at POTWs and the stepstaken to correct the problem are included in thefollowing discussion of the POTW performance
evaluation process.
A flowchart for conducting a POTW performance
evaluation is presented in Figure 3-1.  The POTWperformance evaluation involves a review of the majortreatment unit processes (e.g., primary sedimentation,activated sludge, and secondary clarification) usingwastewater characterization data and processoperations information.  A TIE Phase I analysis (asdescribed below and in Section 4) also can beperformed to indicate the presence of effluent toxicantscaused by incomplete treatment (e.g., ammonia),routine operating practices (e.g., chlorine), or thedischarge of organophosphate pesticides in the POTWcollection system.  Ammonia and chlorine arecommonly found to cause toxicity in POTW effluentsand should be evaluated at this stage of the POTWperformance evaluation.  As noted in Section 2,ammonia and chlorine may be of concern atconcentrations greater than 5 mg/L and 0.01 mg/L,respectively, depending on the effluent matrix and thespecies being tested.  Levels of concern for otherrelatively common effluent toxicants are listed inTable 2-1.  Special consideration also should be givento chemicals used in the treatment process such as usedor reused waste materials and coagulants, which maycontribute to toxicity due to pass-through of residualconcentrations or impurities in the product.
Based on the process review results and TIE
characterization data, options for improving operationsand performance may be selected and evaluated intreatability studies.  If treatability tests are successful inidentifying options for improving conventionalpollutant treatment and toxicity reduction, the TREproceeds to the selection and implementation of thoseoptions (Section 6).  If no treatment deficiencies or in-plant sources of toxicity are observed, or the treatmentalternatives do not reduce effluent toxicity to16Information and Data AcquisitionFacility Performance Evaluation

A municipality in Texas experienced effluent toxicity
that was related to a vo latile organic compound
entering the POTW.  A pre-aeration system was to beadded to the influent headworks or the grit removalsystem; however, before construction was started, acity employee noticed a strong odor in a sewer linethat was related to the volatile toxicant.  The source ofthe volatile compound was identified and controlled.As a result, effluent toxicity was eliminated(S. Bainter, personal communication, USEPA, Dallas,TX, 1998).acceptable levels, a complete effluent toxicity
characterization should be performed using the TIEprocedures described in Section 4.
POTWs are subject to both variable influent
characteristics and changing operating conditions thatmay have a significant effect of effluent toxicity.  ThePOTW performance evaluation should be conductedduring a period when the influent loadings and facilityoperations are representative of average conditions.  Ifeffluent toxicity varies seasonally or as a result of aspecific operational condition, the POTW performanceevaluation should be scheduled to coincide with theexpected toxic event.  Due to the variability inherent inPOTW operations, it may be necessary to conductadditional POTW performance evaluationinvestigations during the course of the TRE.  Forexample, POTW performance evaluations may beuseful when performed before and afterimplementation of facility modifications, changes inindustrial user activities, or variations in effluenttoxicity.
Operations and Performance Review
The operations and performance review involves theevaluation of the major POTW unit processes using theinformation described in Table 2-2.  This reviewfocuses on the secondary treatment system becausesecondary treatment is responsible for removing themajority of the conventional and toxic pollutants frommunicipal wastewater.  Deficiencies in this system aremore likely to result in incomplete treatment ofwastewater toxicity.  For example, problems withnitrification treatment may cause toxic concentrationsof ammonia to pass through in the effluent.  Other unitprocesses to be evaluated include primarysedimentation, disinfection, and advanced treatmentprocesses such as filtration.
Procedures for evaluating and improving POTW
operations and performance are described in USEPA’sHandbook on Retrofitting POTWs  (USEPA, 1989c).
This handbook describes a two-step process to improvePOTW performance: comprehensive performanceevaluation and a composite correction programapproach.  The comprehensive performance evaluationinvolves a thorough review of the POTW design andoperating conditions to identify problem areas.  Thecomposite correction program involves the systematicidentification and implementation of improvementswith an emphasis on low-cost solutions.  Other usefulsources of information include a joint publication byWater Environment Federation and American Society
of Civil Engineers entitled Design of Municipal
Wastewater Treatment Plants  (WEF/ASCE, 1992a,
1992b) and Metcalf and Eddy’s Wastewater
Engineering Treatment, Disposal, and Reuse  (1991).
Computer software programs, including USEPA’sPOTW Expert  (1990), have also been developed to
“troubleshoot” operations and performance problems.In addition, USEPA ( 1993d) has a data base on
pollutant removal efficiencies (RREL Treatab ility Data
Base, Version 5) for various treatment processes.Although this guidance does not specifically addresstoxicity, correcting conventional pollutant treatmentproblems and controlling in-plant toxicants mayimprove toxicity reduction.  In addition to the notedguidance, public works managers are advised to usethe services of a professional engineer who hasexperience with the POTW treatment system.
Preliminary Treatment
Preliminary treatment processes that may be used toenhance toxicity control include equalization/storageand oil and grease removal.  Equalization basins can beeffective in dampening the effect of slug loads oftoxicity or to equalize flow and organic loadings to
achieve consistent subsequent treatment of the  influent
wastewater.  Oil and grease removal can assist inremoving toxicants associated with oil and grease andto minimize the impact of oil and grease on the POTW.
Primary Sedimentation
Primary treatment processes are designed to reduce theloading of TSS, BOD
5, and COD on the secondary
treatment system.  Toxic pollutant removal also canoccur by sedimentation of insoluble or particulatewastewater constituents.  Optimal removal of bothtoxic and conventional pollutants in primary18sedimentation ultimately  reduces the amount of
material to be treated in the biological treatmentprocess.
Primary clarifier performance can be evaluated by
comparing BOD
5 removal to the surface overflow rate
(SOR), which is the average daily flow divided by theclarifier surface area.  A clarifier operating at an SORof less than 24 cubic meters per square meter per day(m
3/m2/day) [600 gallons pre day per square foot
(gpd/sq ft)] should remove 35 to 45% of the influentBOD
5.  A clarifier operating at an SOR of 24 to
40 m3/m2/day (600–1,000 gpd/sq ft) should remove
25 to 35% of the influent BOD5 (USEPA, 1989c).  In
most cases, COD removal performance is comparableto the BOD
5 removal performance.  If the primary
clarifiers do not achieve the expected BOD5 or COD
removal, engineering studies should be initiated todetermine the need for additional clarifier capacity.
Removal of toxicity associated with TSS may be
enhanced by addition of coagulants to the primaryclarifiers.  The optimum conditions for coagulation andflocculation of toxicants can be determined by jar tests.These tests are used to establish the optimum type anddosage of coagulant, the proper mixing conditions, andthe flocculent settling rates for enhanced toxicantremoval (Adams et al., 1981).
A key operating parameter for controlling clarifier
performance is sludge removal.  Primary clarifiersgenerally function best with a minimum sludgeblanket.  Sludge withdrawal should be adjusted tomaintain the primary sludge concentration in the rangeof 3 to 6% total solids (USEPA, 1989c).
Biological Treatment
Biological treatment is a critical process at mostPOTWs because it is the process that converts organicmatter and nutrients to settleable microorganisms.Toxic pollutant removal during biological treatmentcan occur by biodegradation, oxidation, volatilization,and adsorption onto the biological floc.  Key factorsaffecting the removal of toxic pollutants are the rates ofbiodegradation, tendency to volatilize, oxidize, or sorbonto solids, and the degree to which the pollutants mayinhibit the treatment process.
Ammonia is a common cause of effluent toxicity at
POTWs that do not include nitrification treatment.  Asnoted by USEPA (1991a), ammonia is often present ineffluents in concentrations varying from 5 to 40 mg/L.These concentrations can cause toxicity depending on
several factors that affect the toxicity of ammonia,including pH, temperature, DO, and TDS.  A simpleTIE procedure for checking whether effluent toxicitymay be related to ammonia is described below (see“TIE Phase I Tests”).  Literature data on ammoniatoxicity (USEPA, 1985a) should only be used as ageneral guide because ammonia toxicity is significantlyaffected by slight pH changes.
The most commonly used biological treatment systems
can be defined as either suspended growth processes,such as conventional activated sludge, contactstabilization, and extended aeration; or fixed filmprocesses, such as trickling filters, denitrificationfilters, and rotating biological contactors (RBC).  Tosimplify the discussion of biological treatment, thefollowing subsections focus on evaluating theperformance of conventional activated sludgeprocesses and related BNR processes, which are thesystems most widely used in POTWs.
Conventional activated sludge treatment is an aerobic
process that can be accomplished in one stage or zone.BNR processes integrate carbon oxidation, as achievedin conventional activated sludge treatment, withtreatment stages designed for nitrification,denitrification, and enhanced biological phosphorusremoval.  These stages require specific treatmentconditions, including anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobiczones in the mixed liquors.  The stages may beseparated by physical divisions, non-discrete zones, orby operating cycle (WEF/ASCE, 1992b).  Thesequence and sizing of the BNR stages depend on theeffluent nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations thatmust be achieved.
Conventional activated sludge processes remove
phosphorus and nitrogen in the course of convertingorganic matter to new biomass.  The typicalphosphorus content of microbial cells is 1.5 to 2% ona dry-weight basis (WEF/ASCE, 1992b). BNRprocesses enhance phosphorus removal by utilizing thesequence of an anaerobic stage followed by an aerobicstage, which results in the selection of a biomasspopulation capable of concentrating phosphorus from4 to 12% of the microbial cell mass.  Enhancednitrogen removal in BNR processes is a two stageprocess:  nitrification oxidizes ammonia to nitrite andthen to nitrate, and denitrification reduces the nitrate tonitrogen gas.  The nitrogen and phosphorus removalprocesses can be used independently (e.g., oxidation19TRE Example
A United States east coast municipality implemented
nitrification to achieve a seasonal NH3-N limit of
1 mg/L (Engineering Science, Inc., 1994).  The POTWtypically achieved less than 1 mg/L NH
3-N.  As a
result, the POTW effluent eliminated chronic toxicityto fathead minnows ( Pimephales promelas ) from May
1 through September 31 each year; however, theeffluent continued to be toxic during the remainder ofthe year.  In an effort to comply with the permit limitfor chronic toxicity, nitrification was extended for thefull year.  This modification eliminated chronictoxicity to fathead minnows throughout the year.ditches and A/O® process, respectively) or can be
integrated into a combined nutrient removal process(e.g., A
2O® and Bardenpho® processes).  A wide
variety of BNR systems are in operation, some ofwhich are proprietary; therefore, specific informationon the process being studied may be obtained byconsultation with the system vendors.
The parameters that are typically used to evaluate the
operational capability of an activated sludge systeminclude organic loading, oxygen requirement, andMCRT.  Additional important operating conditionsinclude the alkalinity requirement for nitrification, andthe BOD
5 requirement for phosphorus removal and
denitrification. Operating values for these parameterscan be compared to design specifications orrecommended criteria to determine how well theprocesses are being operated.
Organic Loading
Organic loading affects the organic removal efficiency,oxygen requirement, and sludge production ofactivated sludge processes.  The most commonmeasure of organic loading in suspended growthprocesses is the F/M ratio, which is the organic loadremoved per unit of mixed liquor volatile suspendedsolids (MLVSS) in the aeration basin per unit time.High F/M ratios (i.e., high organic loading to MLVSS)will result in a low organic removal efficiency, lowoxygen requirement, and high sludge production.  LowF/M ratios (i.e., low organic loading to MLVSS) willlead to high organic removal efficiencies and lowsludge production, but high oxygen requirements.If the suspected toxicants are biodegradable or partition
to activated sludge, the MLVSS of the treatmentprocess should be increased to the maximum levels thatcan be maintained at the POTW.  The maximumMLVSS often will be limited by the availablesecondary clarifier capacity.  It is important to considerthe effect of increased MLVSS on secondary solidsseparation and the TSS concentrations of the clarifiereffluent. The Patapsco Wastewater Treatment Plant(WWTP) in Baltimore, Maryland, was operated at anF/M ratio of 0.40 lb BOD
5/lb MLVSS-day instead of
the design F/M ratio of 0.55 lb BOD5/lb MLVSS-day,
because the POTW could not achieve consistentwastewater treatment at the higher organic loading.The increased MLVSS levels were thought to benecessary b ecause of the toxic effect that industrial
wastewaters were having on the activated sludgebiomass (Slattery, 1987). For optimal treatment, it maybe necessary to maintain F/M ratios that are on the lowend of the range typically observed for biologicaltreatment processes.  The F/M ratio in an activatedsludge system is generally maintained in the range of0.2 to 0.4 lb BOD
5/lb MLVSS-day for conventional
activated sludge, 0.05 to 0.15 lb BOD5/lb MLVSS-day
for extended aeration, and 0.2 to 0.6 lb BOD5/lb
MLVSS-day for contact stabilization (Metcalf andEddy, 1991).  The recommended F/M ratio forintegrated BNR processes is generally in the range of0.1 to 0.25 lb BOD
5/lb MLVSS-day (Metcalf and
Eddy, 1991).
Influent BOD5 concentrations should be high relative
to phosphorus levels to ensure optimal phosphorusuptake and removal in BNR processes.  Althoughoptimum conditions vary according to the systemdesign, the ratio of total influent BOD
5 (TBOD5) to
influent TP should be 20:1 to 25:1 to meet an effluentTP level of 1.0 mg/L or less.  More importantly, theratio of influent soluble BOD
5 (SBOD5) to influent
soluble phosphorus (SP) should be 15:1 (WEF/ASCE,1992b).
The presence of biodegradable material also is
necessary for denitrification in the first anoxic stage ofBNR processes.  For example, the Water ResearchCommission (1984) found that the TKN to COD ratioshould be less than 0.08 to accomplish completedenitrification with the Bardenpho
® process.  In most
cases, carbon must be added to the anoxic stage eitherby internal recycling of BOD
5 in process streams (e.g.,
nitrified effluent) or by chemical addition (e.g.,methanol or acetate).20TRE Example
OUR measurements were used to document the start-
up performance of the activated sludge treatmentprocess at the Patapsco Wastewater Treatment Plant(Botts et al., 1987).  During the start-up, the OUR ofthe biomass averaged 20 milligrams O
2 per liter per
hour per gram MLSS (mg O2/L/hr/g MLSS), and the
POTW frequently exceeded its conventional pollutantpermit limits.  As the biological system becameacclimated to the wastewater, the effluent qualityimproved and the biomass OUR increased to anaverage of 50 mg O
2/L/hr/g MLSS.Oxygen Requirement
Microorganisms in the activated sludge system require
oxygen to metabolize organic material and nutrientsand breakdown biodegradable toxicants.  Oxygen in
diffused air or pure oxygen systems also may oxidizetoxicants.  Oxygen deficient conditions can result inlower treatment efficiency and, as a result, a greaterpotential for pass-through of toxic material.  To ensurean adequate supply of oxygen, the DO level forconventional activated sludge (carbon oxidation)should be at least 2 mg/L during average loadingconditions and 0.5 mg/L under peak loadings(WEF/ASCE, 1992a).  Typical air requirements are1,500 cu ft/lb BOD
5 load for conventional activated
sludge and contact stabilization, and 2,000 cu ft/lbBOD
5 load for extended aeration (USEPA, 1989c).
Air requirements for nitrification are higher because4.2 to 4.6 mg of oxygen are required per mg of NH
3-N
oxidized as compared to 0.6 to 1.1 mg of oxygen
needed per mg of BOD5 oxidized (WEF/ASCE,
1992b).  DO concentrations of 2 to 2.5 mg/L are
needed for nitrification in  activated sludge processeswith short retention times.  In integrated activatedsludge/nutrient removal processes, sufficient oxygenshould be provided to achieve car bon oxidation and
complete nitrification at the maximum daily loadingrate.
Some of the oxygen consumed in the aerobic stage is
in the form of NO
3-N.  This oxygen source  can be
recovered in the denitrification process, which  isgenerally located in an anoxic stage at the head of theBNR system.  Approximately 2.86 mg of oxygen isrecovered for each mg of NO
3-N reduced by biological
denitrification.  Internal recycling from the aerobicstage to the anoxic stage can decrease the oxygenrequired for nitrification by 50 to 60%.  Carryover ofmolecular oxygen from the aerobic stage to the anoxicstage should be minimized by regulating the internalrecycle rate.  Generally, the recycle rate should be nomore than three to four times the influent flow rate forthese systems (WEF/ASCE, 1992b).
The transfer of oxygen from the gas phase to the liquid
phase is a function of the aeration equipment and thebasin mixing conditions.  USEPA ( Handbook for
Retrofitting POTWs , 1989c) describes a procedure for
estimating the oxygen transfer capacity in aerationbasins based on equipment specifications.  Anotherestimate of oxygen transfer capacity involvescomparing OUR of the biomass to the calculatedtheoretical oxygen demand for the aeration system(USEPA, 1989c).  If the OUR results indicate an
oxygen demand that is greater than the calculatedoxygen demand, the oxygen supply may be inadequate.The opposite case (i.e., higher theoretical oxygendemand than actual oxygen demand) is preferred;however, a substantial difference may indicateinhibition of biomass activity.
Oxygen is not desirable in denitrification processes and
the initial (anaerobic) stage of biological phosphorusremoval processes.  Molecular oxygen must be absentfor denitrifying organisms to reduce NO
3-N to nitrogen
gas.  Phosphorus removing organisms requireanaerobic conditions to accomplish the initialphosphorus release step (resynthesis occurs in thesubsequent aerobic zone). NO
3-N and DO
concentrations in the anaerobic zone should be keptbelow 1 mg/L (WEF/ASCE, 1992b).  Although mixingis usually required in anaerobic and anoxic basins, it isminimized to prevent oxygen transfer to the mixedliquors.  Also, DO carry over from the aerobic zone tothe anoxic ( denitrification) zone should be regulated
through independent control of aeration equipment atthe end of the aerobic zone.
Mean Cell Residence Time
In the course of biological treatment, activated sludgemicroorganisms convert some of the organic matterand nutrients in the wastewater to new cell mass.Toxic constituents may also be degraded or adsorbedonto the biomass.  To achieve optimal treatment, thebiomass concentration in the aeration tank is held at aconstant level by routinely wasting the excess sludge.Sludge mass control can be practiced by maintaining aconsistent average age of activated sludge (i.e.,MCRT) in the system.  The MCRT is calculated bydividing the total sludge mass in the system by the21TRE Example
In 1992, Novartis Crop Protection, Inc., in cooperation
with Makhteshim-Agan of North America, Inc., thetwo principal manufacturers of organophosphateinsecticides in North America, evaluated the removalof diazinon and chlorpyrifos by various treatmentmethods (Novartis, 1997).  Anecdotal evidence fromother studies (Fillmore et al., 1990) and treatabilitystudies by Novartis suggested that adsorption ontosolids was the dominant mechanism for removal oforganophosphate insecticides.  The treatability testsperformed in the 1997 study showed that about 30%of the diazinon and 85 to 90% of the chlorpyrifospresent in POTW primary influent samples is adsorbedonto primary influent solids and approximately 65 to75% of the diazinon added to the mixed liquor isadsorbed onto the biomass.  Diazinon adsorption wasgreater for a 30-day MCRT biomass than for a 15-daybiomass.  Chlorpyrifos strongly adsorbed to thebiomass; none remained after biological treatment.These results suggest that longer MCRTs may improveremoval of organophosphate insecticides.amount of sludge that is wasted each day (i.e., lb/lb per
day).
The optimal MCRT for toxicity reduction will depend
on the type of toxicant(s) in the wastewater.  Somecompounds may be more efficiently removed by ayounger biomass (low MCRT) and other toxicants aretreated better with an older biomass (high MCRT)(Metcalf and Eddy, 1991).  In general, biodegradabletoxicants are more efficiently removed using arelatively long MCRT (WEF/ASCE, 1992a); therefore,
the MCRT may be set at the high end of the range ofvalues typically used for biological treatment.Hagelstein and Dauge (1984) also found improvedtoxicity reduction of a petroleum waste at MCRTsgreater than 10 days.  Typical MCRTs for aerationprocesses are 6 to 12 days for conventional activatedsludge, 10 to 30 days for contact stabilization, and 20to 40 days for extended aeration (USEPA, 1989c).System MCRTs for nitrification and BNR processesare generally long (20 to 40 days) because the growthrates of nitrifying organisms are slower compared tothose for heterotrophic organisms found inconventional activated sludge systems  (WEF/ASCE,1992b). Overly long MCRTs should be avoidedbecause subsequent denitrification treatment may beadversely affected if essential carbon has been depletedin the nitrification/carbon oxidation stage.Additional Considerations for BNR Process
Control
Additional considerations for BNR process control
include maintaining sufficient alkalinity, propermanagement of sludge processing sidestreams, andachieving efficient solids separation in the secondaryclarifier.  Nitrification reduces the wastewateralkalinity by 7.2 mg/L as CaCO
3 for each mg of NH3-N
oxidized.  However, about 40 to 50% of the alkalinitydestroyed by nitrification can be restored inthe denitrification process.  The carbonate/CO

equilibrium in the mixed liquor determines the pH.  Asa general rule, alkalinity should be maintained above50 mg/L in the nitrification process in order to keep thepH high enough for optimal treatment.
Secondary Clarification
In order for activated sludge and BNR processes tooperate efficiently, the secondary clarifier musteffectively separate solids from the liquid phase andconcentrate the solids for subsequent return to theaeration basin.  In addition to clarifier design, solids-liquid separation is influenced to a large degree by theaeration basin operating conditions such as DO levels,F/M ratio, and MCRT.  If the MLVSS and MCRT ofthe aeration basin is to be maximized for toxicitycontrol, it is important to consider the impact of thischange on  secondary solids separation and effluentTSS concentrations.  Sludge settling characteristics areaffected by how the aeration basin is operated.  Low orhigh DO levels in the aeration basin can result in thegrowth of filamentous bacteria (e.g., Norcardia  spp.
and Sphaerotilus natans , respectively) that can hinder
solids settling, whereas DO levels of 2 to 4 mg/Lpromote the growth of “zoogleal-type” bacteria, whichaggregate into fast settling flocs.  At very high organicloadings (high F/M), the activated sludge can bedispersed and will not settle well.  This condition wasobserved at the East Side Sewage Treatment Plant inOswego, New York, which experienced sl udge bulking
due to high effluent organic loadings (USEPA, 1984a).Sludge settl eability was improved by increasing the
MCRT and the sludge return rate.
The performance of secondary clarifiers in solids-
liquid separation is dependent on a variety of factorsincluding clarifier configuration, SOR, clarifier depthat the weirs, the type of sludge removal mechanism,and the return sludge flow rate.  USEPA’s Handbook
on Retrofitting  POTWs (1989c) describes a system for
scoring secondary clarifier performance based on thesefactors.  Design clarifier SORs for conventional22activated sludge processes are typically in the range of
400 to 800 gpd/sq ft (Metcalf and Eddy, 1991).  Ingeneral, integrated BNR processes require largerclarifier capacity than conventional activated sludgeprocesses, particularly where effluent quality must behigh.
Clarifier capacity is important for phosphorus removal,
because phosphorus is associated with the biomass,which can be carried over into the final effluent asresidual solids.  At peak sustained flow, a clarifierSOR of 800 gpd/sq ft is recommended to achieve afinal effluent TP concentration of 2 mg/L.  Lowereffluent TP limits may require chemical treatmentusing a metal salt of iron, aluminum, or calcium, and,perhaps, a follow-on filtration process.  For example,effluent phosphorus levels at the Jerry Sellers POTWin Cocoa, Florida, were reduced from an average of 2.9mg/L to less than 0.2 mg/L with the add ition of
aluminum sulfate, commonly referred to as alum(WEF/ASCE, 1992b).  In general, effluent TP levels of0.2 to 0.5 mg/L can be met through chemical additionwith a clarifier capacity of 500 gpd/sq ft (WEF/ASCE,1992b).
Process Sidestreams and Wastewater Bypasses
Some wastewater and sludge treatment processes canproduce sidestream wastes that may have a deleteriouseffect on the wastewater treatment system or mightcontribute to effluent toxicity.  In addition, raw orpartially treated wastewater that bypasses part or all ofthe treatment system can add substantial toxicity toPOTW discharges (Mosure et  al., 1987).
Examples of POTW sidestreams include sludge
processing wastewaters (from thickening, digestion,and dewatering of sludges), cooling water blowdown,incinerator scrubber blowdown, and backwash fromtertiary filters.  Sidestreams from anaerobic digestionand sludge dewatering can contain high concentrationsof BOD
5, COD, nitrogen, and phosphorus that can
represent a significant loading to the aeration basin.Nitrogen and phosphorus in sidestreams are a concernfor BNR processes, which can be compromised unlessthe  loadings are removed, equalized, or separatelytreated.  Also, some sidestreams may contain toxicmaterials such as metals and cyanide that may passthrough the POTW.  For example, cyanide may beformed during incineration of biosolids.  Once formed,the cyanide may be captured in the incineratorscrubbers and introduced into the treatment system via
the scrubber waste stream.  If the treatment processdoes not degrade the cyanide, toxic concentrations maybe discharged in the POTW effluent. Also, sufficientamounts of cyanide may be present to cause inhibitionof the biological treatment process, which leads to therelease of more cyanide in the POTW effluent.
In some municipalities, storm water and sewage are
still collected in the same sewer system.  When a largestorm event occurs, the CSO is often diverted awayfrom all or part of the treatment system to preventhydraulic over loading.  In some cases, untreatedoverflows or bypasses may be directed into the POTWeffluent, which can cause the discharge of relativelyhigh concentrations of toxic and conventionalpollutants.
The POTW performance evaluation should include a
review of data on process sidestreams, wastewaterbypasses, and overflows that are discharged into all orpart of the POTW or into the final effluent.  Additionalanalytical and toxicity data may be needed tocharacterize the levels of toxic pollutants and toxicityin these waste streams. Information on the frequency,volume, and toxicity of sidestream discharges,bypasses, and overflows also can be compared tohistorical effluent toxicity data to evaluate possibletrends or relationships.  This information can be usedto determine if the discharges are a significant sourceof pollutants or toxicity, and whether current treatmentpractices are sufficient to remove toxicity.  Ifnecessary, consideration may be given to enhancedtreatment of process sidestreams to remove toxicantssuch as metals.  Enhanced treatment may involvechanging the dosage of currently used coagulantsapplied for solids separation or adding new coagulantand flocculent aids.  Bench-scale jar tests can beperformed to determine the optimum type and dosageof coagulant and the appropriate treatment conditions.
Advanced Treatment Processes
Advanced treatment processes may be included insome POTWs to achieve pollutant removal beyondwhat is provided by biological treatment.  Theseprocesses may include filtration, adsorption, chemicaltreatment, air stripping, and breakpoint chlorination.Of these processes, chemical treatment and filtrationare most commonly used in POTWs, particularly forenhanced phosphorus removal.23TRE Example
An example of the potential problems that may occur
with process chemicals was the use of a dechlorinationagent at several City of Houston wastewater treatmentplants (S. Bainter, personal communication, USEPA,Dallas, TX, 1998).  The City had routinely passedeffluent toxicity tests until a dechlorination chemicalwas obtained from a new vendor.  When the chemicalwas applied, effluent toxicity was observed at each ofthe POTWs.  At the time, the City did not know thechemical may be a problem and proceeded to retain
consultants to conduct TREs at the f acilities.  In the
meantime, the supply of the dechlorination chemicalwas depleted and the city turned to a new source of thechemical.  When the new chemical was applied, thePOTWs started to pass the effluent toxicity tests.POTW staff can avoid similar problems if vendors arequeried about potential contaminants in the wastechemicals or toxicity tests are performed on productsamples to verify their suitability.TRE Examples
Studies have been performed to evaluate the reductionof organophosphate insecticides by chemical treatment(Novartis, 1997).  Chemical precipitation using ferricchloride and polymer was found to only slightlyreduce diazinon levels.  No major change in diazinonconcentrations was observed whether the coagulantswere added to primary wastewater or secondarytreated wastewater prior to clarification.  Chlorinationtreatment was effective in reducing diazinon fromsecondary clarifier effluent; however, chronic toxicitywas unchanged. Qualitative results suggest that thechlorine oxidized diazinon to diazoxon, a byproductthat exhibits similar toxic effects as diazinon.  Theresults of additional treatments for diazinon are givenin Appendix H.
A study conducted for San Francisco Bay area
POTWs also evaluated the effect of chlorine onorganophosphate insecticide concentrations
(AQUA-Science, 1995).  This study evaluated the useof household bleach as a measure that residentialcustomers could use to degrade diazinon in spraycontainer rinsate and chlorpyrifos from pet flea washesprior to disposal into the sewer.  Samples of tap waterwere spiked with diazinon (6 0.0 µg/L) and
chlorpyrifos (10.0 µg/L) and treated with either 0.005or 5% solutions of household bleach for 24 hours.Results showed that both bleach concentrationsChemical Treatment
Chemical treatment can contribute to toxicity where
toxic residual concentrations or contaminants in theproduct are present in the final effluent.  Chemicalsused in the latter stages of wastewater treatment are ofparticular concern because final treatment processes(e.g., tertiary clarification, chlorination) are less likelyto remove residual concentrations (Note: potentiallytoxic disinfection byproducts, including residualchlorine, are discussed in a following subsection).When used wisely, treatment additives such ascoagulants, flocculent aids, and hydrogen peroxide(H
2O2) can also improve toxicity treatment.
Chemicals of concern in POTWs include chemicals
formerly classified as hazardous waste.  Under RCRA,a hazardous waste sold to a POTW is no longerconsidered a hazardous waste.  According to 40 CFRPart 261.21(c)(5)(ii):
“A material is ‘used’ or ‘reused’ if it is...
employed in a particular function orapplication as an effective substitute for acommercial product (for example, spentpickle liquor used as phosphorus precipitantand sludge conditioner in wastewatertreatment).”
Chemical treatment is often practiced for phosphorus
removal at POTWs.  Typical coagulant aids includelime, alum, sodium aluminate, ferric chloride, and
ferrous sulfate.  These coagulants have generally notbeen found to be toxic at the concentrations typicallyused for phosphorus removal.  For example, alumdosages as high as 20 mg/L did not cause chroniceffluent toxicity in treatability tests conducted at theCity of Durham, North Carolina (Appendix D).Nonetheless, steps should be taken to preventexcessive and inadvertent chemical use. Also, eachchemical additive used for treatment should beevaluated as a potential source of toxicity, not justsuspect chemicals.
If toxicity is associated with suspended solids,
chemical treatment conditions may be modified toenhance toxicity removal.  The optimum conditions forcoagulation can be determined by conducting jar tests.These tests can be used to establish the optimum typeand dosage of coagulant, the proper mixing conditions,and the flocculent settling rates for improvedphosphorus and/or toxicity removal (Adams et al.,1981).24reduced concentrations of the insecticides by 86 to
92%.  The study suggested that household bleach maybe an effective pretreatment for waste solutions of thetwo insecticides prior to disposal. Additional studiesare planned to further define bleach exposure timesand concentrations under actual use conditions and tocharacterize the chemical oxidation products produced
by the chlorine treatment.  Additional information onthis study is presented in Appendix F.
H
2O2 has been used by a North Carolina municipality
to control toxicity associated with non-polar organictoxicants (Aquatic Sciences Consulting, 1997).Although the specific toxic com pounds were not
identified; jar tests with H
2O2 showed a substantial
reduction in chronic toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia
(C. dubia) at dosages ranging from 1 to 10 mg/L H2O2.
Since the City began adding H2O2 to the POTW
effluent (final concentration of 5 to 7 mg/L), results ofa single C. dubia test show that the effluent NOEC
was reduced from <15 to 90%.
Granular Media Filtration
Granular media filtration is usually applied after
biological treatment to remove residual suspendedsolids, particulate BOD
5, or insoluble phosphorus.
Filter influent is often chemically pretreated to enhanceremoval of suspended solids and phosphorus.  Inaddition to the metal salts noted above, polyelectrolytesmay be added to improve coagulation and flocculationof chemically treated influents. Typical polymerdosages are 0.5 to 1.5 mg/L for settling of fl occulent
suspensions before filtration and 0.05 to 0.15 mg/L
when added directly to the filter influent.  Somepolymers can be toxic to aquatic life (Hall andMirenda, 1991); therefore, polymers used in thefiltration process should be evaluated for the potentialto contribute to effluent toxicity.
Poor filter performance should be investigated,
especially  the pass-through of potentially toxicmaterial.  Loss of suspended solids and other pollutantsmay result from high hydraulic and solids loadings,excessively long filtration cycles, and incompletebackwashing and cleaning of the filter.
Disinfection
Disinfection is generally achieved by treating thesecondary effl uent with chlorine and allowing a
sufficient contact period prior to discharge.Alternative disinfection practices such as ultraviolet(UV) radiation are becoming more popular because ofconcerns about the effects of chlorine on aquatic life
and human health.
The chlorine disinfection process should be carefully
evaluated because residual chlorine and other by-products of chlorination (i.e., mono- and dichloro-
amines, nitrogen trichloride) are toxic to aquatic life
(Brungs, 1973).  Chlorine dosages are usually based onthe level of residual chlorine to be maintained in thefinal effluent as specified in the NPDES permit. ThePOTW performance evaluation should focus on theminimum amount of chlorine that can be applied toachieve the required residual chlorine concentration. Insome cases, the TRC level specified in the NPDESpermit may be sufficient to cause effluent toxicity.  Ingeneral, TRC concentrations above 0.05 mg/L are a
concern (D. Mount personal communication, AScICorp, Duluth, Minnesota, 1991), although its toxicitywill depend on the effluent matrix and the species usedfor effluent monitoring.  Residual chlorine levels canbe compared to toxicity data reported in the literature(USEPA, 1984b) to determine if chlorine may be apotential cause of effluent toxicity.  If dechlorination
is practiced following chlorination, information on thetype and amount of oxidant-reducing material alsoshould be obtained.
A chlorination process that is not continuously adjusted
to varying flow and chlorine demand may causeeffluent toxicity. Fortunately, this problem can becorrected easily by more frequent monitoring of thechlorine residual in effluent samples and more frequentadjustments in the addition of chlorine anddechlorination chemical.  Flow-proportional feedequipment for chlorine and dechlorinating agentsshould be used to minimize the potential for excesschemical addition.
TIE Phase I Tests
TIE Phase I tests (USEPA 1991a, 1992a) can beconducted in parallel with the above operations andperformance review to obtain information on the typesof compounds causing effluent toxicity.  An overviewof the Phase I procedure is described in Section 4 ofthis guidance.
TIE Phase I testing in the POTW performance
evaluation focuses on characterizing toxicants that maybe present in the effluent because of inadequatetreatment performance or routine operating practices.Phase I results, when taken together with the POTWperformance evaluation data, may provide important25clues about possible in-plant toxicants.  Based on this
information, treatability tests may be designed toevaluate methods for removing the suspected effluenttoxicants.
TIE Phase I testing includes several characterization
steps that can be used to indicate the presence of “in-plant toxicants” such as ammonia and chlorine.  Onestep involves pH adjustment of the effluent sample tothree distinct pHs, such as pH 6, 7, and 8 prior totoxicity testing to indicate the effect of pH changes oneffluent toxicity.  The pH adjustment will shift theequilibrium concentration of ammonia between itstoxic form (NH
3) and its essentially nontoxic form
(NH4).  As pH increases, the percentage of total
ammonia (NH3 and NH4) present as NH3 increases.  If
adjusting the effluent sample pH to 8 increases thetoxicity and if lowering the effluent sample pH to 6decreases the toxicity, the identity of the effluenttoxicant would be consistent with ammonia (Section4). Another Phase I step is designed to indicatewhether wastewater oxidants, such as TRC (i.e., freechlorine and m ono- and dichloroamines), are causing
toxicity.  Sodium thiosulfate, a reducing agent, isadded to eliminate TRC and other oxidants. Thethiosulfate is added to serial dilutions of the effluentsample with 1 or 2 levels added across the dilutions.Toxicity tests on samples with and without thiosulfatetreatment are used to indicate if oxidants such as TRCmay be causing effluent toxicity.
It is important to note that each of the TIE Phase I
characterization steps described above addresses abroad class of toxicants rather than specific effluentconstituents, such as ammonia and TRC (USEPA,1991a).  For example, the toxicant affected by pHadjustment may be a pH sensitive compound thatbehaves in the same manner as ammonia.  Also, theoxidants that are neutralized in the thiosulfatetreatment step include bromine, iodine, and manganousions in addition to TRC.  Also, some cations, includingselected heavy metals, are complexed by thiosulfateand may be rendered nontoxic (Hockett and M ount,
1996).  Therefore, the Phase I results should becompared with information from the POTW operationsand performance review to substantiate the evidencefor a particular toxicant.  Using the previous example,the assumption that TRC is causing oxidant toxicitywould be corroborated if operations data show thattoxic concentrations of chlorine are maintained in thefinal effluent (see Table 2-1 for levels of concern).Organophosphate insecticides also have been identified
as causes of effluent toxicity at POTWs (Ankley et al.,1992; Amato et al., 1992; Bailey et al., 1997; Botts etal., 1990; Burkhard and Jenson, 1993).  TIE Phase Iprocedures that affect organophosphate insecticidesinclude C18 SPE and treatment with a metabolicblocker, piperonyl butoxide (PBO). PBO can be addedto effluent samples or methanol eluates from C18 SPEcolumns to block the toxicity of metabolically activatedtoxicants like organophosphate insecticides.  PBO hasbeen shown to block the acute toxicity of diazi non,
parathion, methyl parathion, and malathion tocladocerans, but does not decrease the acute effects ofdichlorvos, chlorfenvinphos, and mevinphos (Ankleyet al., 1996).  A reduction in toxicity by PBO treatmenttogether with toxicity removal by the C18 SPE column,recovery from the C18 SPE column, and effluentconcentration data can provide strong evidence for thepresence of organophosphate insecticides.  Anexception is chlorpyrifos, which is not recovered wellfrom C18 SPE columns (see Appendix F).
Conventional Wastewater Treatability Testing
The operations and performance information mayidentify areas in the POTW where improvements inconventional pollutant treatment may reduce thepass-through of toxicity.  This information andthe optional TIE Phase I data also may indicate in-plant sources of toxicants such as processsidestreams or over chlorination.  Using these data, awastewater treatability program may be devised andimplemented to assess in-plant options for improvingconventional treatment and eliminating in-plantsources of toxicity.
Treatability studies are recommended prior to
comprehensive TIE testing (Section 4) in situationswhere improvements in treatment operations andperformance are needed to attain acceptable
conventional pollutant treatment.  Otherwise, TIEtesting of poor quality effluents could lead to erroneousconclusions about the nature of effluent toxicity.  Forexample, inadequate conventional pollutant treatmentcould cause toxic materials to pass through the POTWthat would otherwise be removed.  In the POTWperformance evaluation, treatability studies shouldfocus on conventional pollutant treatment deficienciesthat are suspected of contributing to effluent toxicity.The scope of the treatability studies program should bebased on clear evidence of a consistent treatmentdeficiency causing toxicity over time.  If sufficient26information is not available to develop a
straightforward treatability program, additional datamust be gathered in the subsequent stages of the TREbefore in-plant toxicity control (Section 6) can beevaluated.
Treatability studies can vary from a simple evaluation
such as testing the effect of TRC reduction on effluenttoxicity to an extensive effort involving long-termbench- and pilot-scale work.  Prior to beginning thesestudies, the POTW operations and performance dataand the optional TIE Phase I results should be carefullyreviewed and an appropriate treatability test programshould be developed using best professional judgment.The nature and variability of effluent toxicity must becompletely assessed (Section 4) prior to implementingan extensive treatability effort.
A treatability program can be devised to evaluate
modifications in existing treatment processes.Evaluating new or additional treatment units should beattempted only after further effluent characterizationstudies (i.e., TIE) have been performed.  POTWperformance evaluation treatability testing may involvephysical/chemical treatment approaches, such ascoagulation and precipitation, solids sedimentation,granular media filtration, powdered activated carbonadsorption, or biological treatment approaches, such asactivated sludge or sludge digestion.
Toxicity control is the ultimate goal of the TRE;
therefore, toxicity tests should be performed in additionto the conventional pollutant analyses normallyconducted in treatability studies.  Toxicity tests areused to assess the capability of the treatmentmodifications for toxicity reduction. In some cases, thewaste streams to be tested may exert a high oxygendemand and aeration may be needed to maintain aminimum DO level of 4 mg/L in the toxicity test.Aeration may affect toxicant characteristics; therefore,it may be necessary to use an alternative test method,such as Microtox
®, that is not affected by low DO.
Side-by-side testing with alternative methods orspecies and the definitive test can be used to select aprocedure that correlates well with the definitive test.This initial testing will help to ensure that thealternative test method or s pecies is sens itive to the
effluent toxicants of concern.
The following subsections briefly describe some of the
treatability tests that can be used to determine ifimprovements in existing conventional pollutant
treatment will reduce effluent toxicity.  If bench-scaletests suggest that toxicity can be reduced, follow-uppilot-scale or full-scale testing is recommended toconfirm the initial results.  As shown in Figure 3-1, ifthis testing is successful in identifying improvementsin conventional pollutant treatment that will achieveacceptable levels of effluent toxicity, the TRE proceedsto the selection and implementation of those options(Sections 6 and 7).  If, however, the treatability dataindicate that improved in-plant treatment will notreduce effluent toxicity to acceptable levels, otherapproaches must be investigated, including TIE testing(Section 4).
Chemical Treatment
Chemical treatment may be applied in primarysedimentation, secondary clarification, filtration, andsidestream treatment processes.  As noted above, jartests can be used to determine the optimum type anddosage of chemical, the proper mixing conditions, andthe flocculent settling rates for improved conventionalpollutant and toxicity removal (Adams et al., 1981).As noted, some chemical additives, including polymers(Hall and Mirenda, 1991), can be toxic; therefore, thetoxicity of the chemicals should be evaluated as part oftreatability testing.
Sedimentation
Sedimentation processes remove suspended solids orflocculent suspensions from the wastewater.  Ingeneral, sedimentation in POTWs is characterized byflocculent settling for wastewater (i.e., primaryclarification) and zone settling for mixed liquors (i.e.,secondary clarification) and sewage sludges (sl udge
thickening).
Flocculent settling rates can be converted to a clarifier
SOR by measuring the flocculent percent removal withtime in a settling column test (Adams et al., 1981).  Ifcoagulants are needed, the optimum conditions forflocculation can be determined from jar tests, as notedabove.  A series of settling column tests can then beperformed to compare particle settling profiles forvarious coagulant doses and mixing conditions.
Zone settling also can be evaluated in settling column
tests.  The settling velocity of mixed liquor or sludge isdetermined by measuring the subsidence of the liquid-solids interface over time (Adams et al., 1981).  Aseries of tests are performed using the anticipated27TRE Example
Activated carbon was investigated as a toxicity control
option in the TRE at the Linden Roselle SewerageAuthority’s (LRSA) POTW in New Jersey (AppendixG).  Both PAC and granular activated carbon (GAC)were expected to remove non-polar organic toxicity inthe effluent; however, the costs were determined to beprohibitive.  It was also anticipated that carbon wouldconcentrate the toxicants in the mixed liquor and causeunacceptable sludge quality.range of suspended solids loadings to the clarifier.
Test results are used to calculate a solids flux curvethat can be used for clarifier design.
Activated Sludge
Continuous flow and batch biological reactor tests canbe used to assess pollutant and toxicity treatability, andto predict the process kinetics of an activated sludgesystem.  A series of bioreactors are generally operatedunder a range of MCRT values to determine optimumoperating conditions (Adams et al., 1981).
The operational performance of bioreactors can be
evaluated by measuring pollutant removals, OUR,MLVSS, and the zone settling velocity (ZSV) of thesludge.  These measurements are used to determine thebiodegradation kinetics of the wastewater, the potentialfor treatment inhibition, and the preferred sludgesettling conditions.  Samples of the influent,intermediate treatment stages, and effluent of thebioreactors can also be tested for toxicity to evaluatethe system’s toxicity reduction capability.  Appendix Dprovides an example of the use of batch treatabilitytests to evaluate toxicity reduction in a BNR process.
If results of bench-scale treatability tests suggest that
full-scale treatment will reduce effluent toxicity,follow-up pilot-scale or full-scale tests arerecommended to confirm the results.
Granular Media Filtration
Toxicity removal by filtration can be evaluated inbench-scale tests or in full-scale tests of existingprocesses.  The main parameters to be evaluated infiltration testing include hydraulic loading rate, mediatype and configuration, and, if necessary, type and doseof chemical coagulant (Adams et al., 1981). Filtrationtesting results can be used to correlate removal ofsuspended solids and toxic compounds with loss oftoxicity. These results are ultimately used to establishthe optimum design and operational conditions forconventional pollutant and toxicity removal, includingfilter type and l oading rates, media characteristics,
backwashing, and headloss development. Examples ofthe use of filtration in toxicity treatability studies arepresented in Appendices C and D.
Activated Carbon Adsorption
Activated carbon may be applied in powdered form tothe activated sludge process or may be used in granularform in a post treatment process (e.g., columns).  Thecapability of carbon adsorption for treatment of organicwastewater constituents or toxicity is determined by
conducting batch isotherm tests and continuous-flowtests (Adams et al., 1981).
The effectiveness of carbon in removing BOD
5,
selected organic contaminants (e.g., phenols), ortoxicity is predicted by adding varying amounts ofpowdered activated carbon (PAC) to wastewatersamples and measuring removal of the organicconstituents or toxicity.  The equilibrium relationshipbetween a wastewater and carbon usually can bedescribed either by a Langmier or Freundlich isotherm.A plot of equilibrium concentration versus carboncapacity is used to select the required PACconcentration to add to activated sludge processes.
Continuous-flow tests are required to confirm the batch
isotherm results.  PAC tests involve adding PAC tobench- or pilot-scale biological reactors and monitoringthe removal of the organic wastewater constituents ortoxicity.
Pretreatment Program Review
POTW pretreatment program data (Table 2-3) mayprovide information that can be used in subsequentsteps of the TRE such as the toxicity source evaluation(Section 5).  Information on the main trunk lines andthe types of indirect dischargers in the sewer collectionsystem can be used to devise a sampling strategy fortracking the sources of toxicants or toxicity.  In somecases, the pretreatment program data may be sufficientto identify the sources of effluent toxicants identifiedin the TIE. In most cases, however, additional data,such as wastewater flow and toxicant concentrations inindirect discharges, will be needed to track the sourcesof toxicants or toxicity.
The information needed to conduct a toxicity source
evaluation is presented in Section 5.  In a USEPA TRE28TRE Example
The PPCR approach was applied at the Mt. Airy
POTW in North Carolina that receives industrialwastewater from only a few sources, all of which aretextile industries (Diehl and Moore, 1987).  Detailedinformation on the manufacturing processes andwastewater discharges of the industries was gathered,including data on the toxicity and biodegradability ofraw and manufactured chemicals as provided inmaterial safety data sheets (MSDS) and the scientificliterature.  This information was used to identifyindustrial chemicals with a relatively high potential tocause toxicity.  Subsequent chemical analysis of thePOTW effluent was performed to evaluate thepresence of the suspected industrial toxicants.Effluent results were then compared to literaturetoxicity values for individual compounds.  Using thisapproach, APE surfactants, largely attributed to textileindustries, were identified as the primary causes ofPOTW effluent toxicity.research study conducted in Linden, New Jersey,
pretreatment program data on wastewatercharacteristics of the main sewer lines and industrialdischargers were used to develop a comprehensivetoxicity tracking program (see Appendix G). Sourcesof toxicity were successfully identified by devising asampling schedule that accounted for periods of normalindustry activity and periods of temporary shut-downfor industry maintenance.  The level of toxicity fromthe industries was found to vary with the industryproduction schedules.
It may be possible, in a few cases, to identify the toxic
sources by comparing chemical-specific data on thePOTW effluent to information on suspected sources ofthe toxic pollutants.  This pretreatment programchemical review (PPCR) approach is recommendedonly in situations where the POTW has only a few
indirect dischargers that have relatively non-complexwastewaters.
PPCR methods are described in Appendix I.  These
methods involve a direct comparison of industrychemical data to POTW effluent toxicity.  It isimportant to emphasize that drawing preliminaryconclusions based on PPCR results can be misleadingbecause pretreatment monitoring information could beincomplete, analytical techniques may not be sensitiveto low levels of effluent toxicants, and the estimatedtoxicity of individual compounds may not reflect thewhole effluent toxicity.  Domestic sources of toxicantssuch as organophosphate insecticides also may be
responsible for effluent toxicity (see Appendices Aand F).  In summary, comparisons of toxic pollutantconcentrations to effluent toxicity may yield falsecorrelations.  Whenever possible, results of TIE testingshould be used in lieu of PPCR results because the TIEestablishes a cause and effect relationship betweentoxicants and effluent toxicity.29Section 4
Toxicity Identification Evaluation
Introduction
The TIE is an integral tool in the TRE process and is
applied to evaluate the acute and short-term chronictoxicity of effluents and other samples.  Toxicity is thetrigger for TREs; therefore, the toxicity test is used inthe TIE as the detector for chemicals causing effluenttoxicity.  Many types of test species and testconditions, including lethal (acute) and sublethal(chronic) measures for both freshwater and saltwater,can be adapted for use in the TIE.  The use of modifiedeffluent monitoring procedures, which incorporate thepermit test species or a suitable surrogate, will help toensure that the toxicants identified are the ones thatspecifically affect the species of concern.  In the TIE,the toxicity test is used to track changes in the presenceand magnitude of toxicity as the effluent ismanipulated to isolate, remove, or render biologicallyunavailable specific types of constituents (e .g., volatile,
filterable, oxidizable).  These procedures relate toxicityto the wastewater’s physical/chemical characteristics todetermine the compound(s) causing effluent toxicity.
This section of the guidance is intended to be a general
guide for TIEs.  For specific guidance on how toconduct TIEs, the reader should consult USEPA’s TIEmanuals (USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1993a, 1993b, 1996).The TIE procedures consist of three phases:  Phase Iinvolves characterization of the toxic wastewatercomponents, Phase II is designed to specificallyidentify the toxicants of concern, and Phase III is
conducted to confirm the causes of toxicity.  Figure 4-1presents the logical progression of these three phaseswithin the framework of a municipal TRE.  USEPAhas published guidance documents for performing eachphase of the TIE procedures.  Phase I procedures areavailable to characterize acute (USEPA 1991a, 1996)and short-term chronic toxicity (USEPA 1992a, 1996).Phase II procedures (USEPA, 1993a) and Phase IIIprocedures (USEPA, 1993b) are used to identify andconfirm the causes of acute or chronic toxicity,respectively.  Each TIE is unique and a strategy should
be developed for each study that accounts for site-specific conditions and allows flexibility in the studydesign, including the use of alternative tools andtechniques noted in the TIE documents.
Several effluent samples should be tested to
characterize the magnitude and variability of effluenttoxicity over time.  Failure to understand the variabilityin whole effluent toxicity and individual toxicantscould lead to the selection of controls that do notconsistently reduce toxicity to compliance levels.Sampling requirements for TIEs are described inSection 11.  In addition to effluent testi ng, the TIE
procedures can be applied in toxicity sourceevaluations (Section 5) to obtain information about thecauses of toxicity in sewer wastewater or industrialdischarges.
Toxicity Tests
The choice of acute or short-term chronic tests in theTIE should be determined based on discharge permitrequirements and the toxicity exhibited by the effluent.Modifications to the whole effluent toxicity testprocedures specified in the permit (USEPA 1993c,1994a, 1994b, 1995) have been made to streamline theTIE process.  These modifications are described in therespective TIE characterization, identification, andconfirmation manuals and include smaller testvolumes, shorter test duration, smaller number ofreplicates, reduced number of test concentrations, andreduced frequency of sample renewal (USEPA 1991a,1992a, 1996).  In addition, it is often more useful toevaluate only one effluent sample in chronic TIEsinstead of multiple samples (e.g., two, three, or seven)as is typically used for chronic toxicity monitoring.Reducing the scale of the toxicity tests improves theefficiency of processing the large number ofsubsamples usually generated in the TIE.

effluent toxicity test methods are applied to confirmthat the toxicant(s) identified in Phases I and II is thecause of the observed effluent toxicity.
TIE procedures have been designed to utilize both
freshwater and estuarine/marine species in acute andshort-term chronic tests (USEPA 1991a, 1993a, 1993b,
1996).  Most POTW discharges to freshwater aremonitored with the cladoceran,  C. dubia , and/or
P. promelas or, less commonly, the cladocerans,
Daphnia magna  or Daphnia pulex , and the trout,
Oncorhynchus mykiss .  C. dubia and P. promelas  were
used in the development of the TIE procedures andmany subsequent TIEs have been performedsuccessfully with these species (USEPA 1991a, 1992a,1993a, 1993b), including the case studies presented inAppendices A, E, and F.  TIEs also have beenperformed with trout (Goodfellow et al., 1994) and thegreen alga, Selenastrum capricornutum  (Walsh and
Garnas, 1983).
In addition, USEPA has provided guidance for the use
of Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coast estuarine/marinespecies in TIEs (USEPA, 1996).  A compilation ofmarine TIE studies has been prepared (Burgess,personal communication, USEPA, Narragansett,Rhode Island, August, 1998).  TIEs have beenperformed using mysid shrimp, Mysidopsis bahia
(Morris et al., 1990; Co llins, et al., 1994; Burgess et
al., 1995; Douglas et al., 1996), the grass shrimp,
Paleomonetes pugio (Goodfellow and McCulloch,
1993), the mussels, Mytilus edulis  (Edile et al., 1995)
and Mytilus ca lifornianus  (Higashi et al., 1992), the
sheephead minnow, Cyprinodon vari egatus
(Goodfellow and McCulloch, 1993; Burgess et al.,1995; Douglas et al., 1996), the inland silverside,Menida beryllina  (Burgess et al., 1995), the purple
urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpurtu s (Bailey et al.
1995; Jirik et al., 1998), the urchin, Arbacia punctulata
(Burgess et al., 1995), the sand dollar , Dendraster
excentricus  (Bailey et al. 1995), the red abalone,
Haliotis rufenscens  (Griffin et al., 1993), the alga,
Champia parvula  (Burgess et al., 1995), the giant kelp,
Macrocystis pyrifera  (Higashi et al., 1992; Griffin et
al., 1993), and other estuarine/marine species (Higashi
et al., 1992; Weis et al., 1992).  Case studies thatutilized the echinoderms, S. purpuratus  and D.
excentricus,  and the mysid shrimp, M. bahia,  are
presented in Appendices B and G, respectively.Although many species can be used in TIEs, the use ofthe species that is specified in the NPDES permit orthat triggered the TRE is encouraged to ensure that the
toxicants identified are the ones that affect the speciesof concern.  Also, NPDES permit species are morewidely used in TIEs; therefore, extensive publisheddata are generally available to help characterize andidentify the toxicants affecting these species.
The TIE should incorporate modifications in toxicity
test procedures that are specified in the permit, to theextent practicable.  If pH control in the toxicity tests isallowed (T. Davies, USEPA, Office of Water,Memorandum on Clarifications Regarding Flexibilityin 40 CFR Part 136 Whole Effluent Test Methods ,
April 10, 1996), the effects of pH should be addressedwhen evaluating effluent toxicants.  However,procedural modifications should be limited to steps thatare easy and practical to implement.
Effluents with intermittent and ephemeral toxicity may
be challenging to characterize using TIE procedures.Intermittent toxicity may require adjustments in theTIE such as performing frequent toxicity screeningtests over time to ensure that toxic samples arecollected.  Some effluents also may exhibit toxicity thatdissipates after the samples are received and the initialand baseline toxicity tests are performed.  If possible,this ephemeral toxicity may be characterized byconducting both the baseline test and TIE treatmentsimmediately upon sample receipt.  Also, it may bepossible to shorten the time between sample collectionand testing (i.e., <36 hours) or use grab samples inaddition to composite samples.  Depending on the levelof effluent toxicity, it also may be challenging todiscern differences in toxicity following the variousTIE treatments.  Steps that may improvecharacterization of these samples include adding morereplicates and/or effluent concentrations in toxicitytests used in the TIE and testing more samples toevaluate trends in the toxicity characteristics.Additional information on this topic is given inUSEPA’s TIE manuals (1991a, 1992a, 1996).
Effluent monitoring data often includes information on
the relative sensitivity of test organisms.  It is generallyrecommended that initial TIE testing be performedusing the test species that has been shown to be mostsensitive to the effluent.  In cases where equalsensitivity is observed, the organism that is easiest touse in the TIE should be selected.  Phase IIIconfirmation tests should utilize each of the speciesrequired by the discharge permit to ensure that alltoxicants of concern have been determined.32A brief description of the TIE procedures is provided
below.  Examples of TIE applications in municipalTREs are presented in Appendices A through G.
TIE Procedures
Acute Toxicity Characterization (Phase I)
The first step in the TIE is to characterize effluenttoxicity using the Phase I approach (USEPA, 1991a).This procedure involves several bench-top treatmentsteps to indicate the general types of compounds thatare causing effluent toxicity.  An initial toxicity test isperformed to determine if the sample is acutely toxic.Simple manipulations for removal or alteration ofeffluent toxicity are then performed and the resultingtreated samples and the original sample are tested fortoxicity.  The physical/chemical characteristics of thetoxicants are indicated by the treatment steps thatreduced toxicity relative to the baseline test.
The Phase I characterization includes the following
tests:
• Initial toxicity (unaltered effluent)
• Baseline toxicity(unaltered effluent)• pH adjustment (pH 3 and 11)• Filtration/pH adjustment (pH 3 and 11)• Aeration/pH adjustment (pH 3 and 11)• C18 SPE/pH adjustment (pH 3 and 11)• Sodium thiosulfate additions• Ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) additions• Graduated pH adjustments.
USEPA recommends performing the full suite of Phase
I procedures on initial effluent samples (USEPA1991a, 1996).  As information is obtained on the natureand variability of toxicity, additional Phase I tests mayfocus on the steps that are successful in affectingtoxicity.  The aeration procedure is used to determineif toxicity is associated with volatile or oxidizablecompounds.  The filtration procedure is designed toevaluate whether toxicity is in the suspendedparticulate phase or in the soluble fraction.  Aerationand filtration, in conjunction with pH adjustments, areused to evaluate the volatility and solubility oftoxicants such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, andmetals.  The toxicity of oxidants and certain metals isevaluated by adding sodium thiosulfate.Cationic metal toxicity is determined byethylenediaminetetraacetate EDTA additions and,possibly, by the graduated pH procedure.  Thegraduated pH step is used to evaluate for the presenceof pH sensitive compounds such as ammonia.  Analiquot of the effl uent sample also is used to evaluate
the presence of pH sensitive compounds such asammonia.  In addition, an aliquot of the effluentsample is passed through a C18 SPE column thatselectively removes non-polar organic compounds(USEPA, 1991a).
In general, the TIE procedures used for marine species
are similar to those used for freshwater species, exceptthat samples used in marine TIEs must be adjusted tothe salinity appropriate to the species being tested(USEPA, 1996).  As part of the development of themarine TIE procedures, USEPA found that marinespecies can tolerate EDTA and sodium thiosulfateadditions at concentrations that can affect toxicants ofconcern.  Marine species can also tolerate methanol atconcentrations that are necessary to evaluate non-polarorganic compounds with the C18 SPE column.However, there are exceptions to the methods used forfreshwater species for TIE steps.  Due to the strongcarbonate buffering capacity of seawater, it is difficultto characterize pH dependent toxicants using acids,bases, and organic buffers.  The only efficient methodfor maintaining pH in the pH manipulation proceduresis to use controlled atmospheric chambers.  Also, ahigher range of pH values is used in the graduated pHprocedure because of the sensitivity of some marinespecies to lower pH.
When characterizing toxicity to marine species,
USEPA recommends adjusting the salinity of samplesbefore performing Phase I manipulations (USEPA,1996; Ho et al., 1995).  However, if a Phase I TIE isbeing conducted to help identify potential treatmentoptions for the POTW, the salinity of the samples maybe adjusted after the TIE manipulations are performed.This approach is n ecessary to ensure that toxicity
removal in the TIE reflects the conditions that wouldoccur in the POTW (i.e., mimics treatment beforedischarge to saline waters).
Subsequent tests are recommended to further
characterize effluent toxicity.  These tests are describedin the acute Phase I document (USEPA, 1991a) in the“Interpretation of Results/Subsequent Tests” sectionsfor each procedure.  Some of these procedures includeelution of the C18 SPE column with methanol to retainpossible toxicants for further testing.  If Phase I doesnot adequately characterize the toxicants, othertechniques can be used, such as ion exchange resins foranions and cations; XAD (a commercially available ionexchange resin) and activated carbon for various33inorganic and organic compounds; and molecular
sieves, such as Sephadex resins that separatecompounds by molecular weight (Walsh and Garnas,1983; Lankford and Eckenfelder, 1990; Burgess et al.,1997).  TDS is an example of a toxicant that may notbe well characterized in the TIE.  Methods forcharacterizing and identifying TDS toxicity arepresented below.
The characterization procedures are relatively broad
and can indicate more than one class of toxicant.Additional tests are needed to delineate the nature ofthe toxicity if significant toxicity changes occurfollowing the Phase I tests.  For example, the C18 SPEcolumn procedure, which is designed to determine ifnon-polar organic compounds contribute to toxicity,also can remove other compounds such as metals.USEPA (1991a, 1992a) reports that aluminum, nickel,and zinc concentrations may be adsorbed onto the C18SPE resin.  Confirmation that the C18 SPE columnremoved non-polar organic compounds is obtained byeluting the column with methanol to try to recover thetoxicity.  If toxicity can be recovered in the methanoleluate, then a non-polar organic toxicant is likelycausing toxicity because metals do not elute withmethanol.  If toxicity adsorbed by the C18 SPE columnis not recovered by the methanol elution, the column
may have removed toxicants other than non-polarorganic compounds, such as metals, or the non-polarorganic compounds may have a higher affinity for theSPE column resin than methanol.  Appendix Eprovides a case example in which toxicity due tometals was removed by the C18 SPE procedure.
When the primary toxicant is present in high
concentrations, it may mask other potential toxicants,making it difficult to detect changes in toxicityfollowing the TIE treatments.  Modified procedurescan be designed to control or account for the toxicity ofthe primary toxicant.  Ammonia is a common exampleof a toxicant that may need to be controlled in the TIE(e.g., pH control) in order to evaluate secondarytoxicants (see Appendix G).
Pretreatment program data and chemical-specific
effluent data may provide useful information to assistin the Phase I characterization.  By reviewing availableinformation, compounds that are known to beproblematic can be compared to the Phase I results toassist in indicating the effluent toxicants.  This datacomparison should not, however, replace the Phase IIand III analyses.After successful completion of Phase I, it may not be
necessary to proceed to Phases II and III.  If the
effluent toxicity can be isolated to a class ofcompounds, POTW staff may opt to evaluate thetreatment of effluent toxicity.  These studies mayinvolve bench-scale or pilot-scale testing proceduresdescribed in Section 6.  However, if toxicity remainsfollowing implementation of toxicity control methods,the TIE should begin again with Phase I.  In mostcases, a complete TIE using all three phases willprovide results that will lead to a more cost-effectiveevaluation of toxicity control approaches.
Chronic Toxicity Characterization (Phase I)
The chronic TIE Phase I procedures (USEPA 1992a,1996) are similar to the acute Phase I procedures andinclude aeration, filtration, C18 SPE treatment,chelation with EDTA, oxidant reduction and/orprecipitation with sodium thiosulfate, and graduatedpH testing.  The chronic test measures sublethaleffects, such as reproduction, fertilization, cystdevelopment, and/or growth.  These measurementsmay be affected by the TIE manipulations.Adjustments have been made in the TIE procedures tolimit toxicity artifacts.  As in acute TIEs, additionalsteps are recommended to evaluate potential toxicityartifacts, including use of system blanks and replicatetests.
The same freshwater species typically used in acute
TIEs (i.e., C. dubia, P. promelas, and, less commonly,
D. magna  or D. pulex) can be applied in chronic TIEs.
Species that have been used in chronic marine TIEsinclude those noted above in the section titled“Toxicity Tests.”
Two tiers of the Phase I characterization are
recommended for the chronic TIE.  Tier 1 is performedwithout major pH adjustments.  Consistent,representative blank tests with reconstituted water arenot readily obtained at higher pHs; therefore, the pHadjustment procedures used in the acute TIE areseparated into Tier 2.  Tier 2 is performed only whenTier 1 does not provide sufficient information aboutthe types of compounds causing toxicity, and includesadjusting the effluent sample to pH 3 and 10 as part ofthe filtration and aeration steps and pH 9 for C18 SPEtreatment.
Tier I of the chronic Phase I characterization consists
of the following:34• Baseline toxicity
• Aeration• Filtration• C18 SPE treatment (including tests on post C18
SPE treatment and methanol eluate)
• Sodium thiosulfate additions• EDTA additions• Graduated pH adjustments.
The Tier 2 tests are to be conducted when Tier 1 does
not provide sufficient information and consists offiltration, aeration, and the C18 treatment technique ofTier 1 with an effluent sample adjusted to both pH 3and 10.  Tier 2 of the chronic Phase I characterizationconsists of the following:
•p H  a d j u s t m e n t
• Aeration and pH adjustment• Filtration and pH adjustment• C18 SPE treatment and pH adjustment (including
tests on post C18 SPE treatment and methanoleluate).
Additional Characterization Procedures for
Evaluating the Effect of Ion Composition
Although toxicity caused by ion compos ition is more
commonly found in industrial effluents, ion-basedtoxicity has been reported at POTWs (Rodgers 1989a,1989b; Douglas and Horne, 1997; Dawson et al.,1997).  Ion composition can cause toxicity in twoways:  relatively high levels of TDS can inhibitosmotic regulation in freshwater species, and animbalance in ion composition, particularly calciumcarbonate levels, can adversely affect marinecrustaceans (Ward, 1989; MacGregor et al., 1996;
Mickley et al., 1996).  The later mechanism primarilyaffects crustaceans such as the mysid shrimp, M. bahia,
which require minimum concentrations of calciumcarbonate for survival, growth, and reproduction.
Procedures for evaluating toxicity caused by ion
composition are available (USEPA 1991a, 1992a;Goodfellow et al., 1998).  The following summary isintended to provide an overview of procedures that canbe used to evaluate ion-based toxicity.
TDS Toxicity
As a general guide, TDS may contribute to acutetoxicity when conductivity exceeds 3,000 and 6,000µhmos/cm at the LC50 for C. dubia and fathead
minnows, respectively (USEPA, 1991a).  For chronictoxicity, TDS may be a concern when conductivityexceeds 1,000 and 3,000 µhmos/cm at the lowest
observed effect concentration (LOEC) for C. dubia and
P. promelas , respectively (USEPA, 1992a).  The
conductivity of 100% effluent is not the relevant
reading, but rather the co nductivity at the
concentrations bracketing the effluent LC50 andNOEC.
C. dubia’s  higher sensitivity to TDS as compared to
P. promelas  can provide additional evidence for TDS
toxicity.  Also, the cladoceran, D. magna,  exhibits less
sensitivity to TDS than the cladocerans, C. dubia and
D. pulex (API, 1998).  These species generally show
similar sensitivities to most toxicants (Mount andGulley, 1992); therefore, the difference in sensitivity toTDS can be useful in characterizing TDS toxicity.  Itis the toxicity of the individual ions that actuallyconstitutes TDS toxicity; therefore, it is important toreview the literature for toxicity data on specific ions.A thorough review of the toxicity of common ions tofreshwater and marine organisms was recentlypublished by the American Petroleum Institute (API,1998).
An approach for evaluating TDS toxicity may consist
of the following steps:
1. Monitor the effluent for TDS and if the
conductivity exceeds the levels given above,
measure the major cations (calcium, magnesium,
sodium, potassium) and anions (carbonate,
bicarbonate, sulfate, chloride).  A cation/anion
balance should be performed to ensure that all
major ions have been accounted for.
2. For freshwater effluents, conduct toxicity tests
using D. magna , C. dubia, and D. pulex.  A
greater sensitivity by C. dubia and D. pulex
compared to D. magna, together with high
conductivity readings, provides a weight of
evidence for TDS toxicity.
3. If TDS toxicity is suspected, review the ion
analysis data gathered above and prepare a stock
solution of the ions in proportion to the amounts
typically observed in toxic effluent samples.
Collect an effluent sample and immediately
measure the constituent cations and anions.
Prepare a mock effluent by adding the solution to
deionized water to yield the same cation/anion
concentrations observed in the effluent sample.
Measure the toxicity of the effluent sample and
mock effluent.  If the toxicity is similar, additional
evidence is provided for TDS toxicity.35TRE Example
Some of these procedures were used in a TIE at a
POTW in Georgia (Dawson et al., 1997) wherechronic effluent toxicity to C. dubia was observed.
TIE characterization tests conducted on the effluentdid not show a reduction in toxicity as a result of thePhase I manipulations.  Independent analyses of theeffluent indicated elevated chloride concentrations.  Amock effluent was prepared as described in step 3,above, and the ion mixture was found to be as toxic toC. dubia as the POTW effluent.  Laboratory toxicity
data for sodium chloride (NaCl) were used to confirmthat the effluent chloride levels would impairreproduction in C. dubia at the effect concentration.
Additional TIE studies were performed on the Georgia
POTW effluent using calcium addition and speciessensitivity tests.  Calcium has been found to reducechloride toxicity in waters with similar ioncomposition as the effluent and addition of calcium toeffluent samples reduced toxicity.  Toxicity tests usingD. magna , which has been shown to be less sensitive
to chloride than C. dubia, also provided evidence for
chloride toxicity.  Overall, the TIE results identifiedchloride as a major contributor to effluent toxicity.4. If TDS toxicity is indicated, additional procedures
can be used to determine the extent to which TDScontributes to effluent toxicity.  A sample of theeffluent can be prepared for toxicity testing bysetting up an appropriate dilution series and thenadjusting the TDS levels in each dilution to thesame TDS level as the 100% effluent using thestock solution (prepared above).  Each effluentdilution is then tested individually for toxicity.Comparable results for each effluent dilutionprovides additional evidence for TDS toxicity.
5. Additional testing can be performed to identify the
TDS constituent(s) that are causing toxicity.  Thetoxicity of various cations and anions is wellknown and a review of the literature (e.g., ENSR,1998) can be helpful in indicating potential ions ofconcern.  The ions of concern can be evaluated byspiking the ions into dilution water and measuringthe resulting toxicity.  It should be noted thattoxicity may be caused by a combination of manyions that exert their influence together.  Therefore,a single salt may not be solely responsible for theobserved toxicity.Ion Imbalance
Calcium and carbonate, in proper balance, with othernatural ions, are essential for the formation of newexoskeleton for mysid shrimp and other crustaceans.At low calcium carbonate levels (i.e., 15 mg/L CaCO
3),
Ward (1989) observed 60% mortality in mysidsbetween the 48-hour and 72-hour exposure periods,which corresponds well with the mysid molting cycle.Low CaCO
3 concentrations also appear to enhance
mysid sensitivity to other toxicants.  Ward (1989)observed a significant increase in the toxicity of Cd tomysids when calcium carbonate levels were reduced.
The investigator should consider the potential effect of
ion balance as part of the TIE.  Ion imbalance cancontribute to apparent toxicity in some marinecrustaceans when CaCO
3 concentrations are 15 mg/L
or less.
Interpretation of Phase I Characterization Results
The following information on the interpretation ofPhase I characterization results is paraphrased from theTIE manuals.  The Phase I characterization providesinformation on the types of toxicants in the POTWeffluent.  In reviewing the Phase I data, whether foracute or chronic toxicity characterization, caution isneeded to avoid making inaccurate conclusions aboutthe results.  For example, as noted above, toxicityremoval by C18 SPE treatment does not necessarilymean that non-polar organic toxicants are present.Toxicity must be recovered in the methanol eluate testto provide evidence for non-polar organic toxicants.
The following guidance is given by USEPA (1992a)
for interpreting Phase I data on various types oftoxicants.  Note that the reduction or elimination oftoxicity is determined by comparing toxicity beforetreatment, as measured by the baseline test, withtoxicity after treatment.
Non-Polar Organic Toxicants
Non-polar organic toxicants may be indicated if:
• Toxicity in the post C18 SPE column test  was
absent or reduced.
• Toxicity is recovered in the methanol eluate test .
However, in those instances where methanol doesnot recover toxicity from the C18 SPE column,other solvents may be needed to elute the toxicants(USEPA, 1993a).36• Toxicity is reduced by adding PBO to effluent
samples or methanol from the methanol eluate
test.  PBO blocks the toxicity of metabolically
activated toxicants like organophosphateinsecticides (USEPA, 1992a).
Cationic Metals
Cationic metals may be indicated if:
• Toxicity is removed or reduced in the EDTA
addition test .
• Toxicity is removed or reduced in the post C18
SPE column test.
• Toxicity is removed or reduced in the filtration
test, especially when pH adjustments  are coupled
with filtration.
• Toxicity is removed or reduced in the sodium
thiosulfate addition test.
• Erratic dose response curves are observed.
None of these characteristics is definitive, with the
possible exception of EDTA.  In addition, toxicity maybe pH sensitive in the range at which the graduated pHtest is performed, but may become more or less toxic atlower or higher pH depending on the particular metalinvolved.  This characteristic has not beendemonstrated for chronic toxicity to the extent it hasfor the acute toxicity of several metals (USEPA,1991a).
Surfactants
Surfactants may be indicated if:
• Toxicity is reduced or removed in the filtration
test.
• Toxicity is reduced or removed by the aeration
test.  In some cases, toxicity may be recovered
from the walls of the aeration vessel using adilution water or methanol rinse.
• Toxicity is reduced or removed in the post C18
SPE column test.  The toxicity may or may not be
recovered in the methanol eluate test .  If a series of
methanol concentrations (e.g., 25, 50, 75, 80, 85,90, 95, and 100% in water) is used to elute thecolumn, toxicity may be observed in multiplefractions.
• Toxicity is reduced or removed in the post C18
SPE column test using unfiltered effluent.Toxicity reduction/removal is similar to thatobserved in the filtration test  and toxicity may or
may not be recovered in the methanol eluate test
or by extraction from the glass fiber filter used inthe filtration test .
• Toxicity degrades over time as the effluent sample
is held in cold storage (4 /G01C).  Degradation is
slower when the effluent sample is stored in glasscontainers instead of plastic containers.
Ammonia
Ammonia may be indicated if:
• Toxicity increases in the graduated pH test  at
higher pH.
• The effluent is more toxic to P. promelas  than to
C. dubia.
• Note:  If the concentration of total ammonia (as
nitrogen) is 5 mg/L or more and chronic toxicity isa concern, the potential for ammonia toxicityshould be evaluated.
Drawing conclusions about ammonia toxicity based
solely on observed concentrations can be misleading,especially where chronic toxicity is a concern becauseof the uncertainty about the chronic effects ofammonia.  Ammonia is an example of a toxicant thatacts independently of other toxicants in effluents.Even though ammonia concentrations may appear to besufficient to cause all of the effluent toxicity, othertoxicants may be present and may contribute to toxicitywhen ammonia is removed.
Oxidants
Oxidants may be indicated if:
• Toxicity is removed or reduced in the  sodium
thiosulfate addition test.
• Toxicity is removed or reduced in the aeration
test.
• The sample is less toxic over time when held at
4oC (and the type of container does not affect
toxicity).
•C. dubia are more sensitive to the effluent than P.
promelas.
The presence of TRC in the effluent is not enough to
conclude that toxicity is due to an oxidant.  However,TRC concentrations of 0.05–0.1 mg/L or more in100% effluent provides strong evidence for oxidant37toxicity.   Further evidence would be provided, if
dechlorination with sulfur dioxide (SO2) or another
dechlorinating agent removes or reduces toxicity(USEPA, 1992a).
TDS
TDS may be indicated if:
• pH adjustments do not remove or reduce toxicity
and a precipitate is not visible in the pH
adjustment test , pH adjustment and filtration test ,
or pH adjustment and aeration test.
• There is no loss of toxicity in the post C18 SPE
column tests , or a partial loss of toxicity, but no
change inconductivity measurements.
• There is no change in toxicity with the EDTA
addition test , sodium thiosulfate addition test , or
the graduated pH test.
• There is a greater sensitivity by C. dubia and D.
pulex compared to D. magna, together with high
conductivity readings.
• A mock effluent prepared with the same ions as
the effluent exhibits similar toxicity as the effluent.
• Toxicity is removed or reduced by ion exchange
resin.
• Toxicity is not removed or reduced by passing the
effluent over activated carbon.
Appendices A, B, E, F, and G provide example Phase I
data and describe how results are used to selectadditional TIE procedures for testing.  The Phase IIand Phase III pro cedures (USEPA 1993a and 1993b)
are applicable to both acutely and chronically toxicsamples.Acute and Chronic Toxicity Identification
(Phase II)
The Phase II guidance manual (USEPA, 1993a)
describes procedures that can be used to identifyspecific toxicants such as non-polar organic
compounds, ammonia, cationic metals, chlorine, ortoxicants removed by filtration.  The Phase IIprocedures are applicable to both acute and chronictoxicant identification.  Phase II uses treatment andtoxicity testing techniques similar to Phase I andincorporates chemical-specific analyses to identify thetoxicants.  Examples of TIE Phase II studies areprovided in Appendices A, B, E, F, and G. AppendicesA, F, and G describe the use of Phase II techniques fornon-polar organic compounds, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for theisolating toxicants.  Appendices B and E describe theapplication of Phase II procedures for identifying toxicmetals.  Appendix G describes how Phase IIprocedures were used to identify ammonia toxicity.
Acute and Chronic Toxicity Confirmation
(Phase III)
The toxicants identified in Phase II may be confirmed
by a series of Phase III steps, including correlatingtoxicity and toxicant concentration from multiplesamples, observing test organism symptoms, evaluatingspecies sensitivity, spiking effluent samples withsuspected toxicants, and performing a mass balance toaccount for all of the effluent toxicity.  In many cases,it will be appropriate for the Phase I, II, and IIIevaluations to overlap because confirmationinformation can be obtained during Phases I and II.Examples of TIE confirmation testing are provided inAppendices A, B, E, F, and G.38Section 5
Toxicity Source Evaluation
Introduction
Once the effluent toxicants have been identified, a
follow-up evaluation can be conducted to locate thesources of the toxicants.  This evaluation may involvea review of existing pretreatment program data or datafrom the collection and analysis of additional samplesfrom industrial users.  In some cases, the TIE may notidentify the specific compounds causing effluenttoxicity and, in the absence of data on toxicants, thesources of toxicity must be tracked.  Examples ofcompounds that are not easily identified in the TIEinclude surfactants and some non-polar organiccompounds (other than organophosphate insecticides).Although the class of compounds may be indicated inthe TIE, it may not be possible to locate the sourceswithout information on the specific toxic compounds.In these cases, a guidance is available to track thesources of toxicity.
A toxicity source evaluation is conducted to locate the
sources of influent toxicity or toxicants that arecontributing to the POTW effluent toxicity.  Thisevaluation is performed in two tiers whether chemical-specific or toxicity tracking is to be performed:
• Tier I—generally involves sampling and analysis
of wastewater samples collected from the mainPOTW sewer lines.
• Tier II—is performed using samples collected
from tributary sewer lines or point sources on themain sewer lines found to be toxic in Tier I.
This tiered tracking approach can be used to identify
the sources of toxicity and/or toxicants through aprocess of eliminating segments of the collectionsystem that prove to be non-toxic.
The flow diagram for the toxicity source evaluation is
presented in Figure 5-1.  The choice of chemical-specific analyses or toxicity tests for source tracking
will depend on the TIE data on the POTW effluenttoxicants.  A chemical-specific investigation isrecommended in cases where the effluent toxicantshave been confirmed and can be traced to theresponsible sewer dischargers.  If the sources oftoxicants are located, the TRE can then proceed to theevaluation of local pretreatment limits as described inSection 6.  Toxicity tracking, using the refractorytoxicity assessment (RTA) approach described herein,is required in situations where the TIE does not provideconclusive data on the effluent toxicants.  Prior totoxicity analysis, sewer samples are subjected to thesame type of treatment as is provided by the POTW forits influent wastewaters.  This treatment step allows ameasurement of “refractory” wastewater toxicity,which is the toxicity that passes through the POTWand causes effluent toxicity.  If toxicity tracking issuccessful in locating the sources of toxicity,
pretreatment requirements can be set to reduce therefractory toxicity contributed to the POTW.
In some cases, industrial users may modify or cease the
discharge of toxicity before specific sources areidentified.  The abatement of effluent toxicity duringthe course of TREs is not uncommon; however, effortsto ensure ongoing compliance can be difficult when theoriginal sources of toxicity are not located.  Thesesituations dramatize the importance of collectinginformation on industrial pretreatment activities andPOTW operations in the early stages of the TRE.  Aspart of the toxicity source evaluation, POTW staff canrequest industrial users to submit weekly or dailyreports of production and waste discharge activitiesthat can be used to indicate potential sources oftoxicity.  This information also is helpful in subsequentpretreatment control studies, if an industrial user isidentified as a source of toxicity (Botts et al., 1994).39Additional

Figure 5-1.  Flow diagram for a toxicity source evaluation.40Sampling Approach
The “Tier I” and “Tier II” designations refer to the
sampling approach to be taken in tracking the sourcesof toxicity and/or toxicants.
Tier I – Toxicity Source Evaluation
Sampling locations for Tier I testing are established byreviewing the pretreatment program data (Section 3)and selecting appropriate sampling points on the mainsewer lines.  In some cases, industrial users or tributarysewer lines may be selected when substantial evidenceis available on potential sources of toxicity ortoxicants.
If the toxicants have been identified and chemical-
specific tracking is to be performed in Tier I, samplinglocations can include industrial users who havemanufacturing processes or use raw materials that areknown or suspected of containing the toxicants (e.g.,metals from metal finishers).  If the toxicant iscontributed by a large number of dischargers, sewerline sampling is recommended in Tier I.  For example,sewer line sampling was conducted to determine thesources of organophosphate insecticides in the City ofFayetteville, North Carolina, sewer system and severalsewer systems in the San Francisco Bay Area inCalifornia (see Appendix F).  These studies indicatedthat two insecticides, diazinon and chlorpyrifos, arewidely distributed in POTW collection systems.
If toxicity tracking is to be performed in Tier I, each
major sewer line should be sampled to ensure that allpossible sources in the collection system areconsidered.  Indirect discharger sampling is notrecommended in Tier I because of the large number ofsources that may need to be evaluated.  Sewer linetesting may ultimately reduce the number of samplingpoints by eliminating segments of the collection systemwhere toxicity is not observed (USEPA, 1983a).
In the RTA study conducted at Fayetteville, North
Carolina (Fillmore et al., 1990), sewer wastewatersamples were initially collected from manholesthroughout the collection system because of the largenumber of potential sources of toxicity.  Sources oftoxicity were subsequently identified by testing theindirect dischargers located on the toxic sewer lines.
Tier II – Toxicity Source Evaluation
Results of Tier I are used to establish the samplinglocations for Tier II.  The toxic sewer lines identifiedby toxicity or toxicant tracking in Tier I can be furtherevaluated in Tier II by sampling indirect dischargers or
tributary sewers on the toxic sewer lines.
Information on classes of toxicants such as surfactants
can be obtained by coupling the RTA protocol withselected TIE procedures.  For example, in the TRE atthe LRSA, New Jersey, sources of non-polar organictoxicants were identified by passing RTA test samplesthrough C18 SPE columns (see Appendix G).  Sourcesof toxicity were indicated if toxicity was observed inmethanol eluates from the columns .
Sampling Conditions
Whether sampling of sewer lines or indirect
dischargers is conducted, 24-hour flow proportionalcomposite samples are recommended to characterizedaily variations in toxicant concentrations or toxicity.In some cases, samples may be collected over less than24 hours to observe the contribution of potentialintermittent sources of toxicants or toxicity.
Flow data must be gathered in order to determine the
relative contributions of toxicants or toxicity from thesewer lines or indirect dischargers.  Flow data can beused to calculate the toxicant loadings, which will beneeded to develop local pretreatment limitations(Section 6).  Flow data also will be needed to conductRTA testing, as described later in this section.
The sampling period for both sewer lines and indirect
dischargers should account for:
• Discharge schedules for indirect dischargers
(i.e., intermittent versus continuous).
• Temporary shut-down schedules for industry
maintenance.
• Coordination with routine pretreatment program
monitoring, if possible.
For example, in the LRSA TRE (Appendix G), sources
of refractory toxicity were identified by samplingduring periods of normal industry activity and duringa period of temporary industry shut-down.
Other considerations for sampling are described in
Section 11.  QA/QC sampling requirements arediscussed in Section 8.
Chemical-Specific Investigation
A chemical-specific approach can be used to trace theinfluent sources of toxicants if definitive TIE data onthe causes of POTW effluent toxicity are available.41This approach is not recommended in cases in which
the TIE data only indicate a broad class of compounds(e.g., polar organic compounds), because the toxicantsmay be contributed by a variety of sources that will bedifficult to pinpoint by chemical tracking.Chemical-specific tracking should be conducted afterthe effluent toxicants have been identified andconfirmed in TIE Phase II and III tests (USEPA 1993a
and 1993b).
The chemical-specific approach involves testing
indirect dischargers or sewer line samples for toxicantsusing chemical analysis techniques.  In some cases,existing pretreatment program data may be adequate toidentify the indirect dischargers that are contributingthe toxicants.  It is likely, however, that furthersampling and analysis will be necessary, becausepretreatment program data generally do not includeinformation on toxicants typically identified in TIEtests (e.g., compounds other than regulated pollutants).Existing pretreatment program data may be used toreduce the amount of sampling and analysis byindicating which sources contribute toxic pollutantsthat are similar to the effluent toxicants.
Chemical analysis methods for potential toxicants such
as ammonia, metals, and organic compounds aredescribed in several USEPA documents (USEPA1979b, 1983b, 1985b) and Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater  (APHA, 1995).
USEPA (1997) provides all of USEPA’s methods foranalysis of water on a CD-ROM.  USEPA’s Phase IITIE manual (1993a) also provides guidance for theanalysis of organophosphate insecticides, surfactants,and metals.  Analytical methods for organophosphateinsecticides have been improved to achieve the lowerdetection limits necessary to assess insecticide toxicity(USEPA, 1993a; Durhan et al., 1990).  Enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures also areavailable for selected organophosphate insecticides,metals, and other compounds.  ELISA methods offerthe advantage of low cost, rapid sample processing,and field portability; however, these methods may notbe specifically approved by USEPA.  Additionalanalytical techniques can be found in AmericanSociety for Testing and Materials (ASTM) manualsand peer-reviewed journals such as the Analytical
Chemistry Journal .  A qualified chemist should verify
the selected analytical method in the laboratory prior tosampling and analysis.A literature search also can be made to determine if the
toxicant could be a biodegradation product resultingfrom POTW treatment.  Where clear evidence isavailable to show that the toxicant is a treatment by-product, the sewer sample should be analy zed for the
precursor form(s) of the toxicant as well as the toxicantitself.
In cases where chemical tracking is successful in
locating the sources of the POTW effluent toxicants,the TRE can proceed to the selection and developmentof toxicity control options such as local pretreatmentregulations (Section 6).  Information on toxicantdistribution can be used in developing pretreatmentcontrol options.  For example, although a primarycontributor of ammonia was identified in the LRSATRE (Appendix G), system-wide pretreatmentlimitations were adopted to address all non-domesticsources of ammonia.  In other situations, controlmethods other than pretreatment limitations, such aspublic education, may be needed to control thedischarge of a widely used toxicant.  Public educationhas been successfully used at a number of POTWs(Appendix H) to control the use of organophosphateinsecticides, which can be contributed from manydomestic and commercial areas of the collectionsystem.
If the responsible indirect dischargers are not located,
the TIE results should be reviewed to confirm previousconclusions.  The chemical analysis results also shouldbe carefully reviewed to determine if errors orwastewater matrix effects may have caused inaccurateresults.  In cases where the chemical-specific approachis ultimately not successful, the source evaluationtesting should be repeated using toxicity tests in lieu ofchemical analyses, as described below.
Refractory Toxicity Assessment
Toxicity tracking may be required when the TIEcharacterizes the toxicity as broad classes of toxicantsor identified toxicants cannot be confirmed.  Toxicitytracking also may be useful in situations in which thereare multiple effluent toxicants and the occurrence ofthese toxicants in the POTW effluent is highlyvariable.  In such cases, toxicity testing may be morecost-effective than chemical tracking.
The toxicity found in influent wastewaters is not
necessarily the same toxicity that is observed in the42Wastewater and

removing some toxic wastewater constituents.  Theamount of sewer wastewater toxicity that couldpotentially pass through the POTW must be estimatedby treating sewer samples in a simulation of the POTWprior to toxicity analysis.  This treatment step accountsfor the toxicity removal provided by the POTW.
A protocol has been developed for predicting the
potential for a sewer discharge to contribute to acute orchronic toxicity in POTW effluents.  This protocol,referred to as the RTA procedure, has beensuccessfully used to track sources of acute and chronictoxicity using both freshwater and estuarine/marinespecies (Morris et al., 1990; Botts et al., 1992, 1993,1994).  Examples of RTA studies are presented inAppendices C, D, and G.
The RTA protocol has been designed to simulate
conventional activated sludge processes, although ithas also been adapted to other POTW treatmentprocesses including single and two-stage nitrificationsystems (Collins, et al. 1991), BNR processes(Appendix D), and f iltration treatment systems
(Appendices C and D).  The RTA procedure describedherein involves treating sewer samples in abench-scale, batch simulation of a conventionalactivated sludge process and measuring the resultingtoxicity.  Batch simulations are appropriate forplug-flow biological systems because batch processesbehave over time as plug-flow processes do with flowtime.  Batch biological reactors have been used by
several researchers to screen wastewaters for activatedsludge inhibition (Grady, 1985; Adams et al., 1981;Philbrook and Grady, 1985; and Kang et al., 1983) andnon-biodegradable aquatic toxicity (Hagelstein andDauge, 1984; Lankford et al., 1987; and Sullivan et al.,1987).  Hagelstein and Dauge (1984) and Lankford etal. (1987) have found that toxicity measurementscoupled with bioreactor tests can be a pragmatic wayto evaluate refractory wastewater toxicity.
The RTA protocol was developed in the USEPA TRE
research study at the City of Baltimore’s PatapscoPOTW (Botts et al., 1987) to evaluate the potential forindirect dischargers to contribute refractory toxicity.Additional USEPA TRE research studies in Linden,New Jersey; High Point, North Carolina; Fayetteville,North Carolina; and Bergen County, New Jersey wereconducted to improve the RTA approach (Morris et al.,1990; DiGiano, 1988; Fillmore et al., 1990; Collins etal., 1991).  The RTA procedure described herein is arefined version of the method given in the municipalTRE protocol (USEPA, 1989a).
The batch reactor used in RTA testing is designed to
simulate, as close as possible, the operatingcharacteristics of the POTW’s activated sludge process(e.g., MLSS concentration, DO level, and F/M ratio).Two types of batch reactors are used, as shown inFigure 5-2.  One reactor serves as the control andconsists of the POTW influent and return activated43sludge (RAS).  The other reactor consists of sewer
wastewater spiked into the mixture of POTW influentand RAS.  If the effluent toxicity of the reactor spikedwith sewer wastewater is increased relative to theunspiked reactor, the sewer wastewater would beconsidered a source of refractory toxicity.  In thespiked reactor, sewer wastewater is tested togetherwith the POTW influent in order to observe possibleinteractive effects (e.g., additivity, antagonism) thatcan occur when the wastewater and the total POTWinfluent are combined and treated in the POTW.
A general description of the RTA procedure is
presented below.  A step-by-step protocol for RTAtesting is provided in Appendix J.  The basic steps inthe RTA approach are:
• Conduct conventional pollutant analyses to
develop a profile for each wastewater to be testedin the RTA.
• Perform toxicity tests on the POTW’s RAS
(filtrate) to determine its potential to cause aninterference in RTA testing.
• Collect, characterize, and prepare wastewater
samples for RTA tests.
• Calibrate the RTA batch reactors to achieve a
treatment level comparable to that of the POTW’sactivated sludge process.
• Calculate wastewater volumes to be used in RTA
tests.
• Set-up and operate the RTA batch reactors.• Analyze batch effluent toxicity.• Evaluate the potential for the sewer wastewaters to
inhibit activated sludge treatment (optional).
• Conduct TIE Phase I tests to indicate the types of
refractory toxicants in the sewer wastewater(optional).
• Interpret the results.
It is important to emphasize that the RTA protocol
should be modified to address site-specific conditions.For example, Appendix C describes an RTA study thatsimulated a filtration treatment process in addition to anitrification treatment process.  The followingsummary of the RTA protocol is intended to be ageneral guide to evaluating sources of toxicity usingsimulations of suspended biological growth processes.Best professional judgment is important in adapting theprocedures to treatment processes and conditions thatare unique to each facility.POTW Wastewater Profile
The first step in the RTA is to characterize the POTWinfluent (primary effluent), sewer wastewaters, andRAS to be used in RTA testing.  The POTW influentwastewater should be collected from the effluent of thePOTW primary treatment process because primaryeffluent is treated by the activated sludge process,which is the main process to be simulated in the RTA.RAS is recommended for use in batch testing becauseit is in a concentrated form that can be easily diluted to
the target MLSS concentration.  Mixed liquor from the
POTW’s aeration basins can be used in lieu of RAS;however, the activated sludge will need to be thickenedto the same suspended solids concentration as the RASbefore use.
Table 5-1 presents the analyses and information that
are needed to characterize the wastewaters to be usedin RTA testing.  This information will be useful fordetermining the following operating conditions for theRTA batch reactors, including:
• Determining the volume of sewer wastewater to
use in testing based on sewer line and indirectdischarger flow-rate data.
• Determining whether nutrient addition is necessary
using information on the ratio of organic content(BOD
5 or COD) to nutrient concentrations (TKN
and TP).
• Selecting a test period for the RTA reactors that is
based on the organic content of the sewerwastewater.  Some sewer wastewaters may havesubstantially higher COD concentrations, whichwill increase the initial COD level in the RTAreactor.  A longer treatment time may be needed toensure that the wastewater is treated to the samelevel as the POTW influent.
Biomass Toxicity Measurement
Sometimes the RAS used in testing can cause aninterference in the measurement of refractory toxicity.In the Patapsco TRE, filtered samples of RAS werefound to be acutely toxic to C. dubia (Botts et al.,
1987).  This toxicity was related to residual biosolidsthat passed through the filter [10-micron (µm) poresize].  The toxic biosolids caused the batch reactoreffluents in RTA tests to be acutely toxic and maskedthe refractory toxicity of the wastewaters being tested.This biomass interference reduced the effectiveness ofthe RTA test for determining the sources of refractory44Waste Stream Information Required

toxicity at the Patapsco WWTP.  Additional tests
demonstrated that RAS toxicity could be removed byfiltration of the coarse filtrate through a 0.2 µm pore-size filter or by centrifugation of the coarse filtrate at10,000 times gravity (xg) for 20 minutes (Botts et al.,1987).
Additional information obtained in the Linden Roselle,
New Jersey; Fayetteville, North Carolina; and BergenCounty, New Jersey USEPA TRE research studiesindicated that the POTW RAS filtrate was not acutelytoxic, and therefore did not cause an interference inRTA testing (Morris et al., 1990; Fillmore et al., 1990;Collins et al., 1991).  The existing data on the toxicityof sewage sludges are not sufficient, however, toevaluate the occurrence of biomass toxicity at POTWs.The following discussion provides information on howto proceed, if POTW biomass toxicity is observed.Prior to conducting the RTA, toxicity tests of thePOTW activated sludge should be performed todetermine if the biomass is toxic.  This testing involvestoxicity measurement of two aliquots of RAS: coarse
RAS filtrate and coarse RAS filtrate subjected tocentrifugation to remove colloidal particles.  The RASshould first be filtered through a coarse glass fiberfilter (e.g., 10 µm pore size), which is the same type offilter used for suspended solids analysis (APHA,1995).  Following coarse filtration, an aliquot of theRAS filtrate should be further treated by centrifugationat 10,000 xg for 10 to 15 minutes.  Alternatively, thecoarse filtrate could be f iltered through a 0.2 µm
membrane filter.  However, tests should be conductedto confirm that soluble toxicity is not removed bysorption onto the filter.
Both the RAS filtrate and centrate should be tested for
acute or chronic toxicity using limited-scale tests(USEPA 1993c, 1994a, 1994b).  If results show thatcentrifugation does not reduce biomass toxicity relativeto the coarse filtrate, then the RAS is not likely tocause an interference in RTA testing.  In this case, thePOTW biomass can be used directly in RTA testing45and centrifugation of the RTA batch effluents will not
be required.  Samples of RAS should be periodicallyanalyzed for toxicity during RTA testing to monitor forpossible biomass toxicity.
If the biomass coarse filtrate is observed to be more
toxic than the RAS centrate, the biomass toxicity mayinterfere with RTA testing.  Two options are availablein this case: removal of the toxic biosolids by fineparticle filtration (or centrifugation) of batch testeffluents, and use of an alternate biomass.
Biomass toxicity may be removed by applying the fine
particle filtration or centrifugation treatment steps tothe batch test effluents.  In this case, the resulting RTAeffluent toxicity will only indicate soluble refractory
toxicity, not the total refractory toxicity (i.e., soluble
and particulate).
Another approach to remove biomass toxicity is to use
a non-toxic biomass such as another POTW biomass ora commercially available (freeze-dried) preparation.  Asurrogate biomass will not be acclimated to the influentwastewaters of the POTW being evaluated; therefore,it may not treat the wastewaters as well as the POTW’sbiomass.  Nonetheless, an alternate biomass canprovide a level of treatment that will approximate therefractory toxicity of the sewer wastewater.  It may behelpful to conduct a parallel series of RTA tests usingthe toxic POTW biomass.  The use of toxic POTWbiomass is suggested because it is acclimated to thePOTW influent wastewaters and will therefore providea level of batch treatment that is more similar to thePOTW treatment than that provided by theunacclimated alternate biomass.  In this case, fineparticle filtration or centrifugation is required toremove the interfering biomass particles prior totoxicity analysis.  By performing RTA tests withPOTW biomass in parallel with RTA tests withalternate biomass, both the soluble and total refractorytoxicity of the wastewater may be estimated.
An alternate biomass may be useful in cases where it is
necessary to simulate future modifications or additionsto the POTW activated sludge treatment process (e.g.,conversion from conventional activated sludge tonitrification).  In these cases, a biomass that isindicative of the future activated sludge, may not bedirectly available at the POTW.  An alternate biomasscan be obtained from another POTW that has abiological treatment process similar to the treatmentprocess planned for the POTW.  A TRE conducted by
the City of Durham, North Carolina, used thisapproach to evaluate the toxicity reduction capabilityof planned nutrient removal treatment systems(Appendix D).
RTA Reactor Calibration Testing
Generally, ideal plug-flow conditions do not occur inactivated sludge processes; therefore, it will benecessary to adjust the RTA batch treatment conditionsto account for the actual level of treatment achieved inthe POTW.  One method of controlling the treatmentefficiency of activated sludge processes is to adjust thebiomass concentration, measured as MLVSSconcentrati on.  Batch calibration tests can be
performed using a series of MLVSS concentrationsand the MLVSS concentration that most closelysimulates the POTW treatment efficiency can beselected for RTA testing.
Prior to calibration testing, a target MLVSS
concentration can be estimated using mathematicmodels.  In the Fayetteville TRE, a steady state,completely mixed, multi-stage model (Grady and Lim,1980) was used to determine biokinetic coefficientsthat best modeled the POTW treatment performance(Fillmore et al., 1990).  The biokinetic coefficientswere then used in a steady state plug-flow model(Kornegay, 1970) to calculate a batch MLVSSconcentration that would theoretically simulate thePOTW treatment efficiency.  The model results wereconfirmed in bench-scale, batch reactor tests using arange of MLVSS concentrations, including thetheoretical MLVSS concentration and several MLVSSconcentrations that bracketed the theoretical value.  Inthis case, the MLVSS concentration determined fromthe calibration tests matched the theoretical MLVSSvalue (Fillmore et al., 1990).
POTW primary effluent is typically used in RTA
calibration testing.  The treatment efficiency of thebatch reactors can be evaluated by periodicallycollecting and analyzing samples for COD andtoxicity.  TKN, NH
3-N, and TP may also be monitored
if the batch reactors are simulating BNR treatmentsystems.  Results of the batch reactor tests are thencompared to COD, nutrient, and toxicity data for thePOTW final effluent to indicate which batch reactorachieved treatment comparable to the POTW.  If thereare large differences between batch effluent results andPOTW effluent results, it may be necessary to evaluate46Test Percent Survival in Sample Concentration

The RTA calibration study can also be used to
establish an appropriate test dilution series for thetoxicity tests of batch effluents.  Where possible, thedilution series for toxicity tests should bracket theacute or chronic toxicity value (i.e., LC50 or ICp) asclosely as possible in order to reduce the span of the95% confidence limits.  Increased confidence in thedata is important because sources of refractory toxicityare indicated based on a comparison between effluenttoxicity results for the sewer wastewater-spiked reactorand the POTW influent (control) reactor (Figure 5-2).The following example illustrates this point.
A wastewater from an industrial user is spiked into
POTW influent sample and tested using the RTAprocedure.  The acute toxicity of the RTA effluent ismeasured using two different dilution series: one testseries encompasses a wide range of sampleconcentrations and the other series more closelybrackets the expected LC50.  The dilution series andresulting survival and LC50 values are shown inTable 5-2.
Using dilution series #1, the LC50 for the industrial
wastewater test would be 35% sample with confidencelimits (95%) of 25% to 50% (based on binomialmodel).  Using series #2, the LC50 would also be 35%sample, but the confidence limits (95%) would bemuch tighter at 31 to 39% (based on probit method).The results for the RTA control test together with the
industrial wastewater spiked test are shown inTable 5-3.
In this example, if the control reactor LC50 had been
50% with confidence limits of 42 to 62%, the industrialwastewater would have been indicated as a possiblesource of toxicity based on the results of series #2,because the 95% confidence limits do not overlap (i.e.,31 to 39% versus 42 to 62%).  However, if dilutionseries #1 had been used, the industrial wastewater maynot have been judged to be a toxic source because theconfidence limits overlap (25 to 50% versus 42 to62%).  The partial mortality in the 35% concentrationin series #2 (Table 5-3) helps to more precisely definethe LC50.  The narrow confidence limits in series #2support the conclusion that the refractory toxicity of
the wastewater is significantly greater than the POTWinfluent control (i.e., confidence limits do not overlap).
In the Reidsville and LRSA TREs (Appendices C and
G), the results of preliminary toxicity analyses wereused to adjust the dilution series to closely bracket theexpected IC25 and LC50 value of the batch effluentsamples.  This approach allowed the identification ofsources of refractory toxicity that would not have beenindicated using a standard toxicity test dilution series.
Sample Collection
Wastewater and activated sludge samples should becollected according to the procedures described inSection 11.  Sample volumes will be based on thesubsample volumes needed for periodic reactormeasurements and batch effluent toxicity testing.47Vw(L) /G01Qw
Qi×(Vr /G02Vb)×Fw,Vpe /G01(Vr /G02Vb /G02Vw).The volumes of wastewater and RAS to be used in
RTA testing will depend, in part, on whether acute orchronic toxicity will be measured.  Generally, a batchreactor volume of 3 liters (L) is sufficient whenstandard freshwater and marine/estuarine species (i.e.,C. dubia, Daphnia sp., P. promelas, M. bahia ) are to
be used for testing the acute toxicity of batch effluents.A batch reactor volume of 10 L is adequate to measurechronic batch effluent toxicity using the 7-day C. dubia
test.
Sample Characterization
Average characteristics of the sewer wastewater andPOTW primary effluent can be determined using thewastewater profile data (Table 5-1).  These data shouldinclude historical results of BOD
5, COD, TKN, TP,
TSS, NH3-N, and pH analyses.  Analyses should also
be performed on the samples collected for RTA tests toensure that the wastewater characteristics areconsistent with historical data.
Preparation of RTA Test Mixtures
Two batch influent solutions are prepared for each testof a sewer wastewater sample: sewer sample spikedinto POTW primary effluent, and primary effluentalone.  The sewer sample may be collected from asewer line or an industrial discharge.  The amount ofsewer sample to be used in testing should reflect thepercent volume of sewer wastewater in the POTWinfluent.  In some cases, the wastewater toxicity fromsmall contributors may not be readily observed whenthe wastewater is mixed by percent volume withPOTW influent.  In these cases, it may be necessary touse a greater volume of sewer wastewater than istypically contributed to the POTW.
The volume of sewer wastewater (Vw) sample to be
added to the batch reactor is calculated as follows:
where: Qw is the sewer wastewater flow rate (mgd).
Qi is the average POTW influent flow rate(mgd).Vr is the total reactor volume (gal or L).Vb is the volume of RAS biomass (gal or L).Fw is the sewer wastewater flow concentra-tion factor (e.g., 1, 2, 10 times the sewerwastewater flow).The selection of a flow concentration factor (Fw) will
depend on the percent flow of the sewer wastewater inthe POTW influent.  A conservative, yet realistic,approach would be to use a Fw that is based on themaximum daily wastewater flow from the sewerdischarge in the past year.  The Fw should not causethe sewer wastewater to be 100% of the reactorwastewater volume.  For example, if the sewerwastewater flow is greater than 20% of the POTWinfluent flow, a Fw of less than 5 should be used.  It isnecessary to test the mixture of sewer wastewater andPOTW primary effluent in order to evaluate theinteractive effects (e.g., additive or antagonistic) thatcan realistically occur when these wastewaters arecombined at the POTW.  All sewer samples should betested using the same Fw to allow a comparison ofbatch effluent toxicity between the various sewerwastewaters.
After determining the Vw, the volume of primary
effluent (Vpe) to be added to the batch reactors can becalculated as:
The batch reactor influents are prepared by mixing the
Vw and Vpe for the sewer wastewater spiked reactorand measuring Vpe for the control reactor.  In somecases, it may be necessary to adjust the nutrient levelsor pH of the batch influents prior to testing asdescribed below.
The BOD
5/TKN/TP ratio of the batch reactor influents
should be compared to the average BOD5/TKN/TP
ratio of the POTW influent, as determined fromhistorical or profile data.  The sewer wastewater addedin the batch reactor influent may be deficient innutrients, especially if industrial wastewaters are used.If necessary, nitrogen and/or phosphorus should be
added so that the BOD
5/TKN/TP ratios of the batch
reactor influent and POTW influent are similar.Unless the BOD
5 to nutrient ratios for the batch reactor
influent and POTW influent are clearly dissimilar,nutrient addition is not recommended because of thepotential for added nutrient salts to change thesample’s toxicity.
Using the profile data, BOD
5 and nutrient (TKN, TP)
concentrations (C) in the batch reactor influent(spiked) are calculated as follows:48C(mg/L) /G01(Vpe×Cpe) /G03(Vw×Cw)
(Vpe /G03Vw),
Vb(L) /G01TargetMLVSS(mg/L)
RASVSS(mg/L)×Vr(L).where: Vpe is the volume of primary effluent in
reactor (L).Cpe is the BOD
5 or nutrient concentration in
primary effluent (mg/L).Vw is the volume of sewer wastewater inreactor (L).Cw is the BOD
5 or nutrient concentration in
sewer wastewater (mg/L).
The typical BOD5/TKN/TP ratio for municipal sewage
is 100:5:1 (WEF/ASCE, 1992a).  This ratio will ensurethat sufficient nutrients are available for consistentbatch treatment of the sewer wastewaters.  If necessary,phosphorus should be added in the form of three partsmonosodium phosphate (NaH
2PO4) to four parts
disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4).  Nitrogen should be
added as urea nitrogen, except in cases where ammoniais suspected as a cause of effluent toxicity, becauseurea nitrogen can be converted to ammonia duringbiological treatment.
Following nutrient addition, the pH of the batch
influents may need to be adjusted to within the averagerange of pH for the POTW influent.  Typically, therange of POTW influent pH values will be pH 6 to 9.Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide can be usedfor pH adjustment.
Following nutrient addition and pH adjustment, the
batch influent toxicity should be measured todetermine if the added nutrients or pH adjustmentcause a change in sample toxicity.  Substantialdifferences between the initial toxicity and the adjustedsample toxicity may indicate the presence of specifictypes of toxicants.  Use of pH adjustment for toxicitycharacterization is discussed in the USEPA TIE PhaseI manuals (USEPA 1991a and 1992a).
The volume of RAS biomass (Vb) to be used in batch
testing should yield a batch MLVSS concentration thatis equal to the target MLVSS concentration determinedin calibration testing (see above).  The amount of RASto be added to the total reactor volume (Vr) iscalculated as follows:This equation also is used to determine the alternate
(non-toxic) biomass volume (Vnb), if required.
Synthetic Wastewater Testing (Optional)
In some cases it may be important to determine theamount of refractory toxicity of the sewer wastewaterexcluding the effects of other influent wastewaters.  Abatch influent solution containing sewer sample spikedinto a synthetic wastewater can be used to determinethe individual refractory toxicity of the sewer sample.The synthetic wastewater will provide a standardsubstrate that will allow consistent treatment of thesewer wastewaters.
A synthetic wastewater should be prepared that has a
COD concentration that is equal to the average CODconcentration of the POTW primary effluent.  Thevolume of synthetic wastewater (Vsw) to be added tothe batch reactor is calculated using the same equationthat is used to calculate the volume of POTW primaryeffluent.  A synthetic wastewater has not beendeveloped that is consistently non-toxic (DiGiano,1988).  Prior to use in RTA testing, the syntheticwastewater should be tested for toxicity to ensure thatit will not interfere with the measurement of refractorytoxicity.
Performance of RTA Tests
RTA testing is initiated when the batch influentsolutions are mixed with RAS and diffused air isapplied to the mixture.  The aeration rate should beadjusted to maintain a DO concentration equal to theDO level observed in the POTW activated sludgetreatment process.  Mechanical mixing using amagnetic stirrer and teflon-coated stir bars may berequired to ensure complete mixing in the reactor.  TheRTA tests must be performed in appropriate laboratoryfume hoods to prevent exposure of laboratory staff toany toxic vapors stripped from the wastewater samples(Section 9).
The organic loading to the batch r eactors can vary
substantially depending on the type of sewerwastewater being tested.  For example, a wastewaterwith a high COD concentration (e.g., >5,000 mg/L) islikely to increase the COD loading to the RTA reactor.The effect of this variation on batch treatment can beminimized by adjusting the reactor treatment time toachieve a constant “food-to-microorganism ratio” inthe batch reactor (F/Mb).  F/Mb should be similar to49d /G01BatchInfluentCOD(mg/L)
MLVSS(mg/L)×F/Mb,the F/M of the POTW biological treatment process.
This adjustment will allow the biodegradable materialin the batch influent to be reduced to approximatelyequal levels in all RTA tests.  The required batch testperiod (d) can be calculated as follows:
where: F/Mb is equal to the calculated F/M of the
primary effluent reactor (i.e., COD/MLVSS ×treatment period in days).
Both acute and chronic refractory toxicity can be
measured in RTA testing.  In order to obtaincomparable toxicity results, RTA testing should utilizethe same species that was used for TIE tests or routinecompliance monitoring.  Use of toxicity screening testssuch as bacterial bioluminescence tests (e.g.,Microtox
®) in conjunction with the preferred test
species may provide additional information.  Thesescreening tests are recommended when the wastestreams to be tested exert a high oxygen demand (i.e.,high BOD concentration) which would otherwiserequire aeration during testing and a possible loss oftoxicants.  Standard procedures for toxicitymeasurement are not practical due to the large numberof samples that will need to be processed in the RTA.Instead, simplified acute toxicity test procedures, likethose presented in the USEPA TIE Phase I manuals(USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1996) are recommended.Likewise, simplified procedures for short-termmeasurement of chronic toxicity (USEPA 1992a,1996) are recommended for chronic refractory toxicityassessments.  Oris et al. (1991) and Masters et al.
(1991) describe the use of an abbreviated version ofthe 7-day chronic C. dubia test, referred to as the 4-day
test.  However, the 7-day test has been the method ofchoice for most RTA studies b ecause the use of
younger test animals provides more consistent results.Therefore, 7-day test data are better for discerningdifferences between toxic and nontoxic sources.
The batch test mixtures are prepared for toxicity
analysis by allowing the mixed liquors to settle,decanting the clarified supernatant, and filtering thesupernatant through a coarse glass fiber filter.  Thecoarse filtration step is used to more closely simulatethe POTW clarification process because solids settlingin bench-scale containers is not as efficient as thePOTW settling process.  Note that this step may not berequired if the RTA includes a simulation of effluentfiltration processes at the POTW (see Appendix C).  If
toxic biomass is used in the RTA tests, furtherparticulate removal is required to measure the solublerefractory toxicity in the sewer wastewater.  In thiscase, the coarse filtrate can be filtered through a0.2 µm pore-size glass filter or centrifuged at 10,000xg for 10 to 15 minutes (American Society forMicrobiology, 1981) to remove colloidal size particlesfrom the wastewater.  Membrane filters such ascellulose nitrate filters may not be appropriate becausesome soluble organic constituents may absorb onto thefilter.  Prior to sample filtration, all filters should bewashed and filter blanks should be prepared using thesteps described in Section 8 and Appendix J.
Data Evaluation
Results of RTA testing are used to locate the sourcesthat are contributing refractory toxicity to the POTW.A discussion of the evaluation of RTA results isprovided as follows.
Results of RTA Tests if POTW Biomass is Non-
toxic
Results for each sample analysis will consist of data on
two types of batch tests:  tests of sewer sample spikedinto primary effluent, and a control test using primaryeffluent alone.  The batch test of the sewer sample/primary effluent will indicate the toxicity that wouldrealistically occur upon mixture of the sewerwastewater with POTW influent.  Results of this testare compared to results of the primary effluent controltest to determine if the addition of sewer wastewaterdecreases the refractory toxicity (e.g., dilution orantagonistic effect) or increases the refractory toxicity(e.g., additive effect) of the primary effluent.
If the effluent toxicity of the sewer sample/primary
effluent test is greater than the effluent toxicity of theprimary effluent control test, the sewer wastewatersource may be a contributor of refractory toxicity.POTW influent and sewer wastewater toxicity isknown to vary significantly over time; therefore, eachwastewater source should be tested several times overan extended period (e.g., three times during both coldand warm weather months) to determine the overallpotential for the discharge to cause POTW effluenttoxicity.  Results of Tier I sewer line tracking can beused to prepare a list of the toxic sewer lines.  This listcan be compared to a sewer collection system map toindicate tributary sewer lines or indirect dischargers tobe tested in Tier II.50SSUR /G01Ci(mg/L) /G02Ce(mg/L)
MLVSS(g/L)×TestPeriod(min),The TRE case study summaries in Appendices C and
G describe how RTA results were used to indicatesources of refractory toxicity in the Reidsville andLRSA TREs, respectively.  These studies illustrate theneed to test several samples from each wastewatersource in order to account for the variability inrefractory toxicity over time.
Results of RTA Tests if POTW Biomass is
Toxic
In situations where the RAS coarse filtrate is found to
be more toxic than the RAS centrate, RTA tests mayuse alternate (non-toxic) biomass in addition to testswith the POTW biomass.  The data for each sewersample analysis will consist of results of two batchtests using alternate biomass (i.e., one test of sample/primary effluent, and one test of primary effluent) andresults of two batch tests using toxic POTW biomass.The results of tests that use alternate biomass willprovide an estimate of the total refractory wastewatertoxicity.  The disadvantage of these tests is that thealternate biomass is not acclimated to the POTWinfluent wastewaters; therefore, it may not provide thesame level of treatment as the POTW acclimatedbiomass.
Batch tests using toxic POTW biomass better reflect
the treatment efficiency of the activated sludgeprocess; however, manipulation of the batch effluent(i.e., centrifugation or small particle filtering) removesparticles that normally are present in the POTWeffluent.  Batch effluent treatment is necessary toremove the interfering toxic biomass, but this treatmentmay artificially change batch effluent toxicity.  Theadvantage of toxic biomass tests is that the solublerefractory toxicity of source wastewaters can bedetermined.  The non-toxic biomass tests cannotprovide as good an estimate of soluble toxicity,because alternate biomass is not acclimated to thePOTW influent wastewaters.  If both toxic biomassand alternate nontoxic biomass are used in testing,results are obtained on both the soluble and totalrefractory toxicity of the sewer wastewater.
Inhibition Testing (Optional)
Inhibitory wastewater may upset the normal operationof the POTW biological treatment process to the extentthat it causes toxicity pass-through.  Biologicaltreatment inhibition may occur by three primarymechanisms:  competitive inhibition, non-competitiveinhibition, and substrate inhibition.  The effect ofcompetitive inhibitors is most pronounced at lowsubstrate concentrations.  Inhibition by non-
competitive inhibitors such as chromate or other heavymetals is observed over a range of substrateconcentrations.  The third mechanism of biologicalinhibition, substrate inhibition, occurs at high substrateconcentrations.
Only substrate inhibition can be practically evaluated
in batch treatment tests.  An example of the effects ofsubstrate inhibition on biological activity is shown inFigure 5-3.  This figure shows that substrate utilizationnormally achieves a constant maximum rate as thewastewater concentration is increased.  If inhibitorysubstances are present in the wastewater, the substrateuptake rate would decrease as the wastewaterconcentration is increased further.
Substrate inhibition can be assessed by monitoring
removal of substrate (e.g., BOD
5, COD, TKN, and TP)
and oxygen uptake rates in the RTA batch reactors.  Aseries of dilutions of the sewer line or indirectdischarger wastewater is tested with POTW biomass:one with 100% indirect discharger wastewater and at
least three consisting of serial dilutions (e.g., 50%,25%, and 1 2.5%) of sewer wastewater.  A range of
wastewater dilutions is necessary to compare organic,nutrient, and oxygen removal rates over a range ofsubstrate concentrations.  At high wastewater strengths[e.g., 1 mg/L soluble COD (SCOD) to 4 mg/LMLVSS], biomass activity will generally reach amaximum rate (Figure 5-3).  When wastewaterconcentrations are increased, a decrease in COD,
nutrient, and oxygen removal rates would indicate the
presence of inhibitory materials.
SCOD, ammonia (SNH
3-N), and phosphorus (SP)
removal can be used to calculate the specific substrateutilization rate (SSUR).  The SSUR is reported in unitsof mg/L of soluble substrate per gram MLVSS perminute (g MLVSS/min), and is calculated using theequation:
where: Ci is the influent substrate concentration as
SCOD, SNH
3-N, or SP.
Ce is the substrate concentration in periodicsamples collected from the batch reactor.

follows:
The SSUR and SOUR data for the four wastewater
concentrations can be plotted as shown in Figure 5-3.A reduction in the SSUR and SOUR rates for the fullstrength sample test relative to the SSUR and SOURrates for the sample dilution tests would indicate thepresence of inhibitory material in the sewer wastewatersample.  The degree of inhibition can be inferred by theamount of deviation in biomass activity rates between
the full strength sample test and the sample dilutiontests.
Phase I Toxicity Characterization (Optional)
TIE Phase I tests can be applied to the batch effluent ofthe indirect discharger/primary effluent test todetermine the types of toxicants causing refractorytoxicity in the sewer wastewater.  Results of the TIEPhase I testing can be compared to TIE results for thePOTW effluent to determine if the sewer wastewatercontains the same types of refractory toxicants thatwere observed in the POTW effluent.  Sources thatdischarge the same types of toxicants as those found inthe POTW effluent would be candidates for apretreatment control evaluation (Section 6).  The TIEPhase I procedure is described in Section 4.
Findings of the Toxicity Source Evaluation
The results of Tier I and Tier II testing s hould be
sufficient to confirm the sources of POTW effluenttoxicants or refractory toxicity.  This information canbe used to evaluate and select pretreatment controloptions (Section 6).
It is possible that the toxicity source evaluation results
will suggest that no single sewer line or indirectdischarger is a source of refractory toxicity.  This casemay occur if the sources of toxicants or toxicity are52widely dispersed throughout the collection system.
Examples of dispersed toxicants include organo-phosphate insecticides (e.g., diazinon) and ammonia.The inability to locate the toxicant or toxicity sourcesmay also indicate that the sewer sampling points didnot include all possible sources of the toxicants ortoxicity.  In this case, it may be necessary to evaluateadditional sewer lines in the collection system.In situations where the toxicity source evaluation
proves to be a prodigious task, the permittee may electto evaluate alternatives for in-plant toxicity control(Section 6).  The choice of pretreatment or in-plantcontrols may be determined by assessing the best useof the resources that are available for the TRE.  In thisregard, POTW staff have the option to recover costsassociated with toxicity source evaluation through theprocess of local limits development.53Section 6
Toxicity Control Evaluation
Introduction
The goal of the TRE is to select and implement toxicity
control methods and technologies that will achievecompliance with the permit limits for effluent toxicity.Toxicity control evaluation involves assessing thepotential control options and selecting the bestoption(s) for toxicity reduction based on technical andcost considerations.  Figure 6-1 illustrates the processof evaluation and selection of toxicity control options.Toxicity control may be accomplished either throughthe implementation of pretreatment requirements orPOTW modifications.  Examples of pretreatmentcontrols include local limits development and wasteminimization/pollution prevention requirements.POTW modifications may include changes intreatment chemical usage, enhanced operationalstrategies, or addition of treatment processes.
Criteria for the selection of the preferred toxicity
control option(s) should be defined at the beginning ofthe toxicity control evaluation.  Recommended criteriainclude:
• Compliance with effluent toxicity limits
• Compliance with other permits• Capital, operational, and maintenance costs• Ease of implementation• Reliability• Environmental impact.
Cost will be a primary selection criterion; however, the
selected control option must offer the best potential forconsistent, reliable toxicity reduction with the leastimpact on other permit requirements.  The selectioncriteria should be used initially to screen all candidatecontrol options to determine which alternatives meritfurther study.  The preferred options can then undergoan in-depth review in a pretreatment control evaluation(e.g., local limits development) or in-plant controlevaluation (e.g., treatability studies).  Information fromthese evaluations will be used to select the most
feasible option(s) based on a more thoroughcomparison of the criteria listed above.  The finalselection process may require a quantitativeexamination of the options using a scoring and rankingsystem.  Table 6-1 presents a matrix of in-plant toxicitycontrol options for the TRE case example provided inAppendix G.  Further discussion of the final selectionprocess is provided at the end of this section.
Identifying Toxicity Control Options
The TRE guidance is designed to identify possiblemethods for toxicity reduction at the earliest possiblestage in the TRE process.  As shown in the overallschematic of the TRE process (Figure 1-1), sufficientinformation may be available for toxicity controlevaluation at the completion of the POTWperformance evaluation conventional pollutanttreatability tests, TIE tests, and toxicity/toxicanttracking.  Control options must be identified based onample data that clearly demonstrates the option’stechnical feasibility.
POTW Performance Evaluation Treatability Tests
Treatability testing in the POTW performanceevaluation may identify options for improvedconventional pollutant treatment that also reduceeffluent toxicity to acceptable levels (Section 3).  Inaddition, the optional TIE Phase I tests may provideinformation on the presence of in-plant toxicants suchas suspended solids or chlorine that is corroborated inthe operations and performance review.  The treatmentsteps in TIE Phase I also may provide information ontreatment options for control of the in-plant toxicants.
Potential control options may involve treatment
modifications or additions that are necessary toimprove conventional pollutant treatment and to reduceor eliminate in-plant sources of identified toxicants.Examples of these control options include dechlorin-541010P-02Toxicity Control Evaluation

ation treatment to eliminate toxic levels of chlorine and
biological treatment optimization (e.g., increasedMCRT) to remove toxic ammonia concentrations.
TIE Tests
Results of TIE Phase I testing (Section 4) may indicatethe types of treatment that can be used to remove broadclasses of effluent toxicants (e.g., filterable material,metals, organic compounds).  For example, filterabletoxicants may be removed by granular media filtration.The feasibility of options for removing classes oftoxicants can be evaluated in the POTW in-plantcontrol evaluation.
Alternatively, results of TIE Phases II and III may help
to identify and confirm the specific effluent toxicants(Section 4).  If the pretreatment program data areadequate to determine the sources of the toxicants,local limits can be developed and evaluated in thepretreatment control evaluation.  In this case,pretreatment control would be preferred over in-plantcontrol because the costs of implementation are usually
lower.  If pretreatment program data on the toxicantsare not available, chemical-specific testing will benecessary to track the sources of the toxicants beforetoxicity control selection can proceed.
Chemical-Specific Investigation
Chemical-specific tracking in the Tier I – toxicitysource evaluation may locate the sources of the POTWeffluent toxicants (Section 5).  Once the sources havebeen identified, pretreatment control options such aslocal limits or waste minimization requirements can bedeveloped and evaluated.
Refractory Toxicity Assessment
Results of the Tier II RTA testing may identify theindirect dischargers contributing refractory toxicity tothe POTW.  Based on these results, POTW staff canrequire the indirect discharger to limit the discharge ofwastewater toxicity even though the toxic wastewaterconstituents have not been identified.  In some cases,56POTW staff may elect to perform optional TIE Phase I
analyses to provide information on the toxicconstituents in the indirect discharger wastewater.This additional testing may be conducted so thatnumerical pretreatment limits can be set.
Toxicity Control Screening Process
Using appropriate selection criteria, the preferredtoxicity control options are identified.  Availableoptions can be compared using a ranking system (e.g.,on a scale of 1 to 10).  This screening process may berelatively simple, although some estimate of costs (i.e.,order of magnitude) will be useful in selecting the mostpractical options.  The selected options are then studiedin the pretreatment control evaluation and in-plantcontrol evaluation, as described below.
The example matrix in Table 6-1 compares in-plant
control options for ammonia toxicity.  In this case,costs and qualitative measures were used to rank thevarious options.  All of the in-plant control optionswere found to be impractical or costly; therefore, thesewerage authority investigated pretreatment controls.The source of a majority of the ammonia loading wasan industry, which was considered to be controllable.As a result, the sewerage authority required theindustry to implement ammonia control methods.  Thecost to the authority was relatively low and involved aheadworks analysis for ammonia and reissuance ofdischarge permits.  Additional information on this TREis provided in Appendix G.
Pretreatment Control Evaluation
Pretreatment control options can be developed bypublic works managers to prevent the pass-through oftoxicants, toxicity, and inhibitory material that havebeen traced to indirect dis chargers.  The primary
advantages of pretreatment control of toxicity are thata smaller volume of waste can be managed byaddressing individual sources and the costs are usuallythe responsibility of the industrial users.  Pretreatmentrequirements may involve a public education effort orthe implementation of narrative or numericallimitations for POTW users.
The toxicants to be controlled may not be the same
parameters that are currently regulated under thepretreatment program.  Examples of these types oftoxicants include organophosphate insecticides, TDS,biocides, and specialty chemicals used by industries.In cases where current pretreatment regulations areinadequate to address sources of toxicants or toxicity,
POTW staff should revise or adopt new permitregulations or ordinances, as appropriate.  In thesecases, it may be necessary to initiate the followingsteps to control toxicants or toxicity:
• Investigate public education approaches, if the
toxicant is widely used in the service area(e.g., organophosphate insecticides).
• Perform an allowable headworks loading analysis.• Decide whether to establish local limits or
implement a more directed approach, such asindustrial user management or case-by-caserequirements.
• Develop a monitoring program to evaluate
compliance with the requirements.
These steps are described below.Public education has been successfully used to control
toxicity at POTWs.  Organophosphate insecticidessuch as diazinon and malathion have been identified aseffluent toxicants at many POTWs, especially in thesoutheast and southwest United States (Norberg-Kinget al., 1989).  Insecticides can be discharged by manyusers in the POTW service area, including pest controlbusinesses, veterinarians, lawn care businesses,apartment complexes, restaurants, hotels/motels, officebuildings, and homeowners.  These users are usuallynot included under pretreatment programs and it maybe impractical to control these sources by regulatingeach discharge.  Studies at POTWs in California
(Singhasemanon et al., 1997), Texas (City ofGreenville, 1991), Oklahoma (Engineering-Science,Inc., 1992), and North Carolina (Fillmore et al., 1990)have determined that public education is a viableoption for control of organophosphate insecticidetoxicity attributed to multiple sources.  Recommendedsteps in a successful public awareness program includeidentifying the significant users of insecticides,developing education materials targeted to users, anddistributing the materials on an ongoing basis duringperiods of expected insecticide use.  The City ofGreenville also enacted an ordinance to encourage theenvironmentally sound use of insecticides and requiremerchants to display public education materials whereinsecticides are sold (City of Greenville, 1991).Additional information on the identification andcontrol of organophosphate insecticides is presented inAppendices F and H.  Public education efforts may beapplied to control other effluent toxicants that arewidely used in POTW service areas and are not57practical to regulate through local pretreatment
limitations.
POTW staff have successfully used revised or new
pretreatment regulations to reduce POTW effluent
toxicity (Appendices C, E, and G) .  Local pretreatment
limits can be developed to control sources of toxicantsor toxicity identified in the toxicity source evaluation.USEPA’s Guidance Manual on the Development and
Implementation of Local Discharge Limitations Underthe Pretreatment Program  (USEPA, 1987b) describes
several approaches for developing local limits.  Theseapproaches include:
• Allowable Headworks Loading Method:
Numerical limits are defined based on themaximum pollutant loadings that will allowcompliance with receiving water quality criteria,sludge quality criteria, or protection againsttreatment interferences.
• Industrial User Management Method:  Based on
an in-depth review of indirect discharger practices,POTW staff can set narrative limits for chemicalmanagement practices (e.g., chemical substitution,spill prevention, and slug loading control).
• Case-by-Case Permitting:  Technology-based
limits are established based on levels that can befeasiblely and economically achieved byindustries.
Some of the local limits approaches can be adapted to
address effluent toxicants or toxicity.  For example, theallowable headworks loading method is well-suited fordeveloping limits to prevent the pass-through oftoxicants identified in POTW effluent TIE tests andlocated by chemical-specific analyses in the toxicitysource evaluation.  This method can be used toestablish the maximum level of the toxicant that can besafely received by the POTW without exceeding theeffluent toxicity limit.  The LRSA, New Jersey,conducted an allowable headworks loading analysis toaddress industrial sources of ammonia (see AppendixG).  The results of the analysis were used to developlocal limits for controllable sources in order to reduceeffluent toxicity caused by ammonia.
The industrial user management method provides a
framework for implementing chemical managementpractices including slug discharge control.  In cases inwhich slug loadings contribute to POTW effluenttoxicity, spill prevention or load equalization can beimplemented at the industrial facility to moderate theslug loadings.  USEPA’s Guidance Manual for
Control of Slug Loadings to POTWs  (1988b and
1991c) describes methods for the development of slugloading control programs.
The case-by-case permitting method can be used when
the POTW effluent toxicants cannot be identified, butTIE information on the general classes of toxicants isavailable or sources of toxicity have been located in thetoxicity source evaluation.  Using TIE data, anengineer may be able to select a pretreatmenttechnology that can remove general types of toxicants(i.e., non-polar organic compounds).  In cases wherethe sources of toxicity have been identified, POTWstaff have the authority to require the indirectdischarger to take steps to limit the discharge ofrefractory or inhibitory toxicity (USEPA, 1987b).
Although USEPA and the States with approved
pretreatment programs have overview authority, thechoice of which approach to use for local limitsdevelopment is the municipal government’s decision.The goal in developing local limits is to implementpretreatment regulations that are technically and legallydefensible.  Local limits can include provisions forequitable recovery of costs associated with the toxicitysource evaluation and limits development.
In-Plant Control Evaluation
The objective of the in-plant control evaluation is toselect and evaluate feasible treatment options for thereduction of effluent toxicity at the POTW.Treatability testing may be conducted to determine thetoxicity removal effectiveness and operatingcharacteristics of the candidate treatment options.These tests should use acute or chronic toxicity testsand chemical analyses to evaluate the removal ofspecific toxicants and/or toxicity.  The resulting dataprovide a basis for the final selection and conceptualdesign of feasible POTW process modifications oradditions.
It is important to consider that major changes in
treatment plant facilities or operations may not bepractical due to the cost of new facilities or thecomplexity of additional process operations.  In thesesituations, pretreatment control of toxicity may bepreferred over in-plant control.  Wherever possible, thein-plant control evaluation should be performed inconjunction with the pretreatment control evaluation toidentify the most technically feasible and cost-effectivecontrol option.58Biodegradable

* Air stripping, breakpoint chlorination, and ion exchange also may be considered for ammonia removal; however, the cost of the se
technologies and the use of toxic additives such as chlorine often preclude their use.Table 6-2.  POTW In-Plant Control Technologies for Categories of Toxic CompoundsReview Existing Information
The first step in the in-plant control evaluation is to
review the POTW performance evaluation data on thePOTW design (Section 3) to establish the physicalspace available for new process additions and todetermine the idle facilities and equipment that couldbe used for toxicity control.  Operations andmaintenance information also should be reviewed todetermine if the POTW is capable of handling theincreased operational control that may be required withprocess modifications or additions.  In addition, POTWperformance evaluation information should bereviewed to determine how the control options mightbe integrated into the overall treatment system design.
TIE results on identified effluent toxicants can be used
to determine in-plant control options.  Althoughinformation on specific toxicants is well suited for theapplication of pretreatment control limitations, POTWstaff may choose to evaluate in-plant control of thesetoxicants.  An example is the treatment of ammonia byoptimizing the POTW activated sludge process (e.g.,increase MCRT) to achieve nitrification.  In somecases, TIE Phase I data on the classes of effluenttoxicant can be used to select options to be examined.For example, if filterable material is the principaleffluent toxicant, possible options would includeimproved solids clarification or granular mediafiltration.
In-plant toxicity control may be achieved by
enhancement of the existing treatment system or by theimplementation of additional treatment processes.  In-plant control alternatives for different categories oftoxicants are summarized in Table 6-2.  A descriptionof these control alternatives is provided as follows.
Process Enhancement
Biological Process Control
Biological process control is most easily applied to
suspended growth systems (e.g., conventional activatedsludge and BNR processes), alt hough some
modifications to fixed film processes (e.g., tricklingfilters and RBCs) may be feasible.  The performance ofactivated sludge and BNR systems is generallycontrolled by adjusting several process parameters,including MCRT, MLSS, DO levels, recycle ratio, andF/M ratio.  The treatment efficiency of the activatedsludge system is optimized by varying theseinterrelated process parameters.  A description of theuse of operational parameters for toxicant control isprovided as follows:  “Removal of biodegradable toxiccompounds in suspended growth systems may beimproved by increasing the MCRT” (Adams et al.,1981).  MCRT can be increased by lowering the excesssludge wasting rate.  Longer MCRTs are necessary fornitrification and can be beneficial for thebiodegradation of some types of organic compounds.An example of this approach was practiced at a POTWon the United States’ east coast (Judkins andAnderson, 1992).  The facility was retrofitted to
achieve nitrification to reduce ammonia.  Existingtreatment capacity, including aeration basins andsecondary clarification, was available to accommodatethe longer MCRTs and detention times needed toaccomplish nitrification and denitrification.  Theretrofits involved increasing the air supply, changingthe air diffuser pattern, adding an a noxic zone in the
aeration basins, increasing the MCRT, and modifyingthe return sludge flow.  Usually, mixed liquor from theaerobic zone of the biological treatment process isrecycled to the anoxic zone to accomplishdenitrification.  However, it was possible in this case touse the existing return sludge pumps to recycle thesecondary clarifier underflow to the anoxic zone.  Thecost of the retrofit consisted of approximately$100,000 in capital costs and an increase in annualoperating costs of about 25%.
High MLSS concentrations have been shown to
minimize the effects of inhibitory pollutants onactivated sludge treatment systems (WEF/ASCE,591992a).  High MLSS concentrations increase the
potential for biodegradation and sorption of toxicwastewater constituents and can help to protect thetreatment process from shock loadings.  The maximumMLVSS will often be limited by the availablesecondary clarifier capacity.  It is important to considerthe effect of increased MLVSS on secondary solidsseparation and the TSS concentrations of the clarifiereffluent.
A decrease in F/M (based on BOD
5) effectively
decreases the organic waste loading per unit ofbiomass, which may improve the biodegradation ofsome toxic compounds (Adams et al., 1981).  The F/Mratio is inversely related to MCRT.
Biological process control is not as easily
accomplished for fixed film processes, such astrickling filters or RBCs.  Some adjustments can bemade, however, such as varying the amount and pointof wastewater recirculation in a trickling filter topotentially increase the removal of toxicants ortoxicity.  In addition, secondary clarifier effluent canbe recirculated to dilute high-strength wastes prior totreatment in a trickling filter or RBC.  In some cases,inhibitory pollutants may cause excessive sloughing ofthe fixed film biomass.  This problem may be rectifiedby returning thickened secondary clarifier solids to thefixed film process to help maintain a proper biomasspopulation.
Chemical Addition
The addition of chemicals or additives to waste streamsin existing POTW treatment processes may improvetoxicant or toxicity removal.  Nutrients can be added toinfluent wastewaters that have low nutrient levels(relative to their organic strength) to improvebiological treatment.  Lime or caustic chemicals can beused to adjust wastewater pH for optimal biologicaltreatment or for coagulation and precipitationtreatment.  Other chemical coagulants are used to aidin removal of insoluble toxicants and to improvesludge settling.  Powdered activated carbon may beapplied in activated sludge systems to remove toxicorganic compounds.  A description of each of thesetreatment additives is provided as follows.
Addition of phosphorus, nitrogen, or sulfur may in
some cases improve biological treatment of industrialwastewaters with low nutrient concentrations.  Theoptimal BOD
5/TKN/TP ratio for municipal activated
sludge treatment is 100:5:1.  Lime and causticchemical addition may be used to increase influent
wastewater pH prior to primary sedimentation in orderto enhance the precipitation of heavy metals.  Chemicaladdition may also be appropriate for removal of metalsin sidestreams from sludge processing.  Some metals,however, such as iron and chromium will go intosolution rather than precipitate at alkaline pH.  Theoptimum pH range for metals precipitation varies foreach type of metal and the solubility/precipitationequilibrium can be affected by other factors such asdissolved solids concentrations in the wastewater.Lime and caustic chemicals also provide additionalalkalinity, which is essential for biological treatment,especially nitrification treatment, processes.
Polymers and inorganic coagulants such as alum and
ferric chloride can be introduced to POTW wastestreams to help remove insoluble pollutants.Coagulants may be added to influent wastewater toincrease the sedimentation of toxic constituents inprimary treatment and thereby minimize the loading oftoxicants on the biological treatment process.Coagulants also can be added after the activated sludgeaeration basins to control sludge bulking or reduceeffluent suspended solids, which may be associatedwith effluent toxicity.  The optimum conditions forcoagulation can be determined by conducting bench-scale jar tests.  These tests are used to establish theoptimum coagulant type and dose, the proper mixingrequirements, and the flocculent settling rates fortreatment (Adams et al., 1981).
Coagulants can adversely affect the characteristics of
sewage sludges, which could affect the sludge disposalmethod.  Coagulants may increase the toxicity of thesludge (as measured by a TCLP) as a result of theremoval of toxic wastewater constituents or as a resultof the toxicity of the coagulant itself (e.g., metal salts).Therefore, coagulants should be evaluated carefullyprior to use.
The addition of PAC to an activated sludge unit may
increase the removal of toxic organic chemicals.Organic pollutants that are not biodegraded can beremoved by adsorption onto the surfaces of activatedcarbon particles.  Activated carbon also improvessludge settleability by providing a substrate onto whichsludge flocs can agglomerate.  Alt hough PAC
processes have been used in municipal wastewatertreatment, studies (Deeny et al., 1988) have shown thatPAC regeneration by wet-air oxidation breaks downthe activated carbon particles to carbon fines, which60carry over the secondary clarifier weirs.  In some cases,
periodic additions of PAC to an aeration basin can beused to minimize the effects of toxic slug loadings,thereby improving the stability of the activated sludgesystem.
POTW Modifications and Additions
Where process enhancement is not feasible or will notprovide adequate toxicant removal, physical additionto or modification of the POTW can be undertaken.Additional treatment processes could includeequalization prior to treatment, instrumentation control,BNR, and advanced wastewater treatment processessuch as coagulation/flocculation, granular mediafiltration, and GAC treatment.  Public works managersalso may consider enhancing effluent dilution throughthe addition of an outfall diffuser or relocation of theoutfall to a larger water body.
Equalization
Equalization can be used prior to the biologicaltreatment process to dampen the effect of slug ordiurnal loadings of high-strength industrial wastes.Equalization facilities can be provided to eitherequalize wastewater flows or wastewaterconcentrations.  Flow equalization is partially providedby existing primary sedimentation tanks and can beenhanced by increasing the size of the primary tankage.Concentration equalization requires mixing of thewastewater to moderate intermittent pollutant loadings;therefore, separate facilities must be provided.
Instrumentation Control
Instrumentation/monitoring can be used to help controlslug loadings of toxic constituents in the POTWinfluent wastewater.  For example, transient metalsloadings may be monitored by continuously measuringthe pH and conductivity of the influent wastewater.  Asignificant change in pH or an increase in conductivitymay indicate a slug loading of toxic material, whichcan be manually or automatically diverted to a holdingbasin.  After equalization, the diverted wastewater canbe slowly added back to the influent waste stream todilute the material prior to treatment.
Outfall Diffuser/Relocation
Public works managers may choose to evaluate thealternative of installing a diffuser or relocating theoutfall to achieve better dilution.  For example, theextension of a shoreline outfall to a submerged high-rate diffuser in deeper water may promote rapid mixingand achieve an acute dilution factor of 10 or more.  Ifallowed by applicable state water quality standards, the
effectiveness of outfall relocation or diffuserinstallation can be evaluated along with other controloptions.  The reader is referred to USEPA’s TSD(1991b) for a discussion of the role of dilution inpermitting for whole effluent toxicity control anddetails on mixing zone analyses and high-rate diffusers.
Advanced Wastewater Treatment
POTWs that only utilize primary and secondarywastewater treatment may achieve toxicity reductionby the addition of advanced wastewater treatmentprocesses such as coagulation/flocculation,sedimentation, granular media filtration, and granularactivated carbon.  Each of these processes can provideenhanced removal of some toxicants and toxicity.Treatability tests used to evaluate treatment processadditions are described below.
Treatability Testing
Bench-scale and pilot-scale treatability tests arecommonly used to evaluate treatment options that havebeen selected for testing.  Bench-scale or pilot-scaletests offer several advantages compared to full-scaletesting, including a more manageable test unit size andthe ability to vary the operating conditions to evaluatetoxicity reduction.  Treatability methods can rangefrom simple jar tests for testing coagulation/flocculation options to flow-through bioreactors forinvestigating the biodegradation kinetics of wastewatertreatment.
During treatability testing, influent, effluent, and
sidestream wastewaters of the treatment simulation aretested for acute or chronic toxicity.  Toxicity testing isused to assess the effectiveness of the treatment optionin reducing wastewater toxicity and to determine thefate of toxicity in the treatment process.  Initial testingshould use the simplified toxicity test methodsdescribed in the TIE manuals (USEPA 1991a, 1992a,1996) because of the large number of samples that mayneed to be tested.  Toxicity screening tests such asMicrotox
® also may be used in conjunction with the
required test species to provide additional information.These tests are recommended for waste streams with ahigh oxygen demand (i.e., high BOD
5 concentration),
which would otherwise require aeration when testingwith permit species.  Aeration should be avoidedbecause it may remove volatile or oxidizable toxicants.
Definitive acute or chronic toxicity tests (USEPA
1993c, 1994a, 1994b, 1995) should be used at the61completion of treatability testing to verify the option’s
capability in meeting the NPDES permit limit.
Optional TIE Phase I analyses also may be performedon treatability test samples to confirm toxicant removalby the treatment option.
Activated Sludge/BNR Treatment
The basic parameters of interest in the design of
activated sludge /BNR systems include organic loading,
oxygen requirements, nutrient requirements, sludgeproduction, sludge settleability, and internal recyclerates.  Continuous flow systems are most useful forevaluating activated sludge/BNR systems; however,batch systems may provide sufficient treatabilityinformation in some cases.  An example of the use ofbatch treatment tests in a TRE is provided inAppendix D.  This study determined that an upgrade ofa conventional activated sludge process to a five-stageBNR process would achieve compliance with chronictoxicity limits.  Follow-up monitoring upon completionof the upgrades confirmed the toxicity reduction.
Consideration should be given to evaluating design
specifications and operating conditions that areexpected to optimize the treatment of toxicants andtoxicity.  These parameters may include relatively longMCRTs and high MLVSS levels, which have beenshown to improve toxic pollutant removal and protectthe process from inhibitory wastes (Hagelstein andDauge, 1984; WEF/ASCE, 1992a).
Coagulation/Flocculation
The evaluation of coagulation and flocculationtreatment involves the use of bench-scale jar tests orzeta potential tests to provide information on theoptimum coagulant type and dosage, mixing rates, andflocculent settling rates for removal of solids andflocculent suspensions (Adams et al., 1981).  Resultsof these tests are used to devise treatability tests toevaluate the sedimentation of flocculent suspensions.
Sedimentation
Sedimentation involves the removal of suspendedsolids or flocculent suspensions by gravity settling.Sedimentation is evaluated by conducting a series ofsettling column tests that measure the settling rates ofsolids or flocculent suspensions (Adams et al., 1981).Test results are used to calculate a settling profile thatcan be used for clarifier design.Granular Media Filtration
Filtration testing involves scaled-down models (usuallypilot-scale) of full-sized filters.  The choice of filtermedia and test-flow rates should correspond to theintended design and operating criteria.  Although theprocess scale is reduced, the bed gradation andthickness should be equivalent to anticipated full-scaleprocesses in order to predict actual treatmentperformance (Adams et al., 1981).
Granular Activated Carbon
The carbon adsorption isotherm test is used todetermine the optimum type and dosage of activatedcarbon for wastewater treatment (Adams et al., 1981).Results of this test are used to prepare bench-scale orpilot-scale carbon columns that can be used to evaluatecarbon exhaustion rates and the effect of carbonregeneration on toxicity removal performance.
Toxicity Control Selection
The final process of toxicity control selection involvesan assessment of potential control options and selectionof the best option(s) for toxicity reduction based onseveral criteria.  In most cases, both a pretreatmentcontrol evaluation and an in-plant control evaluationwill have been performed; therefore, the reviewinformation should include the data developed in bothevaluations.
The choice of in-plant toxicity control or pretreatment
toxicity control will depend largely on the technical
and economic feasibility of POTW treatmentmodifications and pretreatment controls.  Pretreatmentcontrol will be feasible in situations where the TIE dataand the toxicity source evaluation data are sufficient todefinitively identify the sources of toxicity.  These datashould provide an indication of the variability oftoxicity and toxicants in the indirect discharge.  If theseconditions are satisfied, POTW staff can set locallimits using the methods outlined above.  In-plantcontrol will be preferred in cases where theimplementation of feasible treatment modifications oradditions is more practical than pretreatment control.Data obtained in treatability studies should includeinformation on the variability of toxicity treatmentperformance and the design criteria for implementingthe treatment option.  In-plant options provide POTWstaff a direct method of controlling effluent toxicity;however, in-plant modifications or additions maysubstantially increase process operation requirementsand maintenance costs.62Selection of Toxicity Control Options
Final selection of the preferred toxicity control
option(s) involves a comparison of the options usingappropriate criteria (see example in Table 6-1).  It maybe necessary to select and implement more than onecontrol option to ensure compliance with effluenttoxicity requirements.  The preceding evaluationsshould provide sufficient information to document thetechnical and cost considerations for each option.
Compliance with Effluent Toxicity Limits or
Requirements
Data gathered through the TRE should indicate that the
selected option will consistently achieve compliancewith the toxicity permit requirement.  Sufficientinformation should be provided to show that the optionwill reduce effluent toxicity even during periods ofmaximum occurrence of toxicity.  If this informationincludes bench and/or pilot-scale treatability data,scale-up factors must be incorporated into estimates oftoxicity reduction to adjust for differences in treatmentefficiency between laboratory and full-scale treatmentsystems.  Likewise, safety factors should be includedin the calculation of local limits to allow for variationin toxicant loadings to the POTW.  It also may benecessary to conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluatethe effectiveness of the options under variableconditions (e.g., variable toxicant loadings or treatmentperformance).
A relative scoring system can be used to rate the
overall potential for the options to achieve permitcompliance.  The scores can be entered into a matrixtable like that shown in Table 6-1.
Compliance with Other Permits
Steps taken to reduce effluent toxicity may have adetrimental effect on other permitted activities such assludge disposal or air emissions.  If toxicants areexpected to be transferred to sludge or air, the potentialeffects on limitations specified in residuals and airpermits should be estimated.  Each option should berated for its potential to comply with related permits.
Capital, Operation, and Maintenance Costs
Sufficient detail on costs should be presented to allowa straight-forward comparison of the control options.Cost estimates should include the effort and materialsrequired for planning, implementation, operation, andmaintenance of the options.  Cost information may beobtained from equipment vendors, engineeringconsultants, and existing data for comparable systems.Costs for requisite environmental and construction
permits should be included.
In some cases, it may be possible to recover some of
the costs of implementation from responsibledischargers.  For example, municipalities may applysurcharges to local limits or request in-kind funding forPOTW modifications or additions to recover the costsof toxicity control.  Anticipated cash returns should beincluded in the final cost estimate.
Costs for all options can be ranked and a score can be
assigned and entered into a matrix table.  Weightingfactors may be incorporated into the scoring if fundingof some options is uncertain.
Ease of Implementation
Factors such as land availability, permits, operability,and maintenance will have a major influence on theselection of options involving POTW modifications oradditions.  Likewise, the economic impact and level ofcommunity cooperation anticipated from newpretreatment regulations will affect the selection ofpretreatment control options.  Public works managersshould develop a list of all potential constraints as wellas benefits of the candidate control methods.  Benefitsshould address items other than effluent toxicity
reduction such as improved treatment conditions orbetter cooperation among POTW users.  Eachconstraint and benefit can be assigned a weightedscore, the individual values can be summed for eachoption, and the total value entered into the matrix table.
Reliability
The selected option(s) must be dep endable.
Pretreatment approaches or treatment processes thattend to malfunction or fail because of difficulties inexecuting complicated operational plans should beavoided.  Experience in implementing similar projectswill be useful in defining the reliability of the options.Public works managers should consider each option’soperational history, maintenance requirements, andlongevity.
Environmental Impact
Some options may require the evaluation ofenvironmental issues related to the protection ofwetlands, rare and endangered species, and culturalresources.  Although the costs of these evaluations areincluded under the above cost criteria, other factorswill affect the decision-making process, includingpublic perception, time period for permit approval (if63needed), and potential remediation issues.  A score can
be developed based on these factors and entered intothe matrix table.
Comparison of the Toxicity Control Options
Scores developed in the criteria evaluation are summedfor each option.  These scores will incorporate allnecessary weighting factors; therefore, the total scoresfor each option can be compared directly.  The options
can be ranked according to their scores and the highestranked option(s) can be selected for implementation.In some cases, it may be necessary to select more thanone toxicity control option to ensure that permitcompliance will be achieved.  This approach is highlyrecommended when the control options are relativelyinexpensive to implement, operate, and maintain.64Section 7
Toxicity Control Implementation
Introduction
Once the evaluation and selection of toxicity control
options has been completed, the final steps in the TREare the implementation of the selected  pretreatmentand in-plant control options and follow-up monitoringto ensure permit compliance.  The degree of effort inthe implementation step will depend on the severity ofthe effluent toxicity and the complexity of the selectedcontrol approaches.  Depending on the findings of theTRE, implementation may involve relatively minorchanges such as modifying POTW operatingprocedures or more complex modifications such asexpanding the POTW’s pretreatment program ordesigning and constructing new treatment facilities.
Implementation
Using the results of the previous steps in the TRE, aToxics Control Implementation Plan (TCIP) should bedeveloped.  The TCIP should summarize the results ofthe TRE, results of the screening and selection oftoxicity control options, and justification for selectingthe preferred toxicity control option(s).  For in-plantcontrol options, the TCIP should provide the basis ofdesign for the selected control options, includingcapital and operating costs, and a schedule for designand construction.  For pretreatment control options, theTCIP should specify the basis of selection andtechnical justification for local limits and dischargermonitoring methods.  In addition, the procedures forimplementing revised pretreatment regulations alsoshould be defined.
Follow-Up Monitoring
Once a control technology has been implemented, afollow-up monitoring program should be developedand implemented to ensure the effectiveness of theselected control option(s).  In most cases, theconditions and frequency of monitoring will be set by
the regulatory agency.  If source controls areimplemented, POTW staff should specify additionalmonitoring requirements for indirect dischargers underthe pretreatment program.  These requirements mayinclude verification of statements from industries thatthe required reduction of toxicity has been made.
The POTW effluent monitoring program should be
designed to provide data to ensure that toxicity hasbeen reduced to acceptable levels and that the TREobjectives have been met.  This program may involvemore frequent monitoring than is required by theNPDES permit, including monitoring to evaluatedaily, weekly, monthly, or seasonal variations ineffluent toxicity that were observed during the TRE.Follow-up monitoring should utilize the test speciesand methods specified in the discharge permit.Additional tests, including surrogate methods appliedin the TRE, may be included to re-evaluatecorrelations between test species that may havechanged as a result of the effluent toxicity reduction.
Any effluent toxicants that were determined to be
present prior to implementation of the controltechnology should be monitored to ensure thatconcentrations are below toxic levels.  Approvedanalytical methods will generally be applied; however,screening methods such as ELISA tests or other fieldkits, which may not be specifically approved byUSEPA, can be used to evaluate trends and identifypotential problems for follow-up testing.  As withtoxicity monitoring, the analytical program should re-evaluate trends in toxicant concentrations observedduring the TRE.  A discussion of an ongoing POTWmonitoring program for organophosphate pesticides isdescribed in Appendix F.65Section 8
Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Introduction
A QA/QC program for the TRE should be developed
and implemented to ensure the reliability of thecollected data.  The QA/QC program should includeaddressing the monitoring of field sampling andmeasurement activities, the review of laboratoryanalysis procedures, and the documentation andreporting of the analytical data.  A QA/QC programshould be designed so that corrective action can bequickly implemented to detect and eliminate erroneousor questionable data without un due expense to the
project or major delays in the schedule.
The POTW laboratory manager should ensure that the
specific QA/QC requirements for TRE activities areaddressed by the facility’s QA/QC plan.  If a privateconsultant is to be used for all or part of the TREtesting, the POTW laboratory manager should requesta QA/QC plan from the consultant and review theconsultant’s proposed QA/QC activities.  Whether theTRE is to be performed by the POTW laboratory or bya consultant, it is essential that the project organizationinclude competent chemists, toxicologists, andengineers who have adequate knowledge of TREmethods.
The QA/QC plan should be prepared prior to the
initiation of the TRE and should contain the followingelements:
• QA/QC objectives
• Sample collection and preservation techniques• Chain of custody procedures• Analytical QA/QC• Laboratory equipment maintenance• QA/QC training requirements• Documentation and reporting procedures• Corrective action protocols.Sample Collection and Preservation
To ensure quality control in sample collectionactivities, the TRE sampling plan (Section 11) shouldbe strictly followed.  In addition, the QA/QC planshould state the minimum sample volumes, maximumsampling holding times, and sample preservationtechniques for each analytical method.  The samplingrequirements for conventional and priority pollutantanalyses are described in USEPA’s Methods for
Chemical Analysis of Water and Wastes  (USEPA,
1983b) and Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater  (APHA, 1995).  Sampling
requirements for acute toxicity tests are provided inUSEPA’s Methods for Measuring the Acute Toxicity
of Effluents to Freshwater and Marine Organisms(USEPA, 1993c) and Methods for Aquatic Toxicity
Identification Evaluations: Phase I, ToxicityCharacterization Procedures  (USEPA, 1991a).
Sampling requirements for chronic toxicity tests areprovided in USEPA’s Short-Term Methods for
Estimating the Chronic Toxicity of Effluents andReceiving Waters to Freshwater Organisms  (USEPA,
1994a), Short-Term Methods for Estimating the
Chronic Toxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters toMarine and Estuarine Organisms  (USEPA, 1994b),
Short-Term Methods for Estimating the ChronicToxicity of Effluents and Receiving Waters to WestCoast Marine and Estuarine Organisms (USEPA,
1995), Toxicity Identification Evaluation:
Characterization of Chronically Toxic Effluents,Phase I (USEPA, 1992a), and Marine Toxicity
Identification Evaluation (TIE)  (USEPA, 1996).
It is important to routinely assess the effects of sample
holding times on wastewater toxicity to predict howlong samples can be kept before changes in toxicityoccur.  For example, the acute TIE Phase I manual(USEPA, 1991a) describes how testing the sampletoxicity on the day of collection and comparing thisinitial toxicity to its baseline toxicity (tested 1 day66later) can provide information on appropriate sampling
holding times for toxicity analysis.  In chronic TIEs,effluent manipulations are performed on the day thesample is received so that the possible effects of anytoxicity degradation are minimized (USEPA, 1992a).
Other QA/QC considerations for TRE sample
collection include routine cleaning and inspection ofautomatic sampling equipment, cleaning samplecontainers according to the requirements for eachanalytical method, and collecting duplicate samplesand field blanks.  When preserving samples forchemical analysis, only analytical grade preservativesshould be used to avoid contamination andoverestimation of analyte concentrations.Unpreserved samples that are to be used for toxicityand chemical analyses require sample containers thatare both toxicologically and analytically clean.Equipment and containers used for toxicity testsamples require special cleaning procedures outlinedin USEPA manuals (1993c, 1994a, 1994b).
Chain-of-Custody
A chain-of-custody (COC) form should accompany allsamples to document the collection, preservation, andhandling of samples.  The COC form should indicatethe sample identification number, sample type (i.e.,composite or grab), date and time of collection, a briefdescription of the sample, number of samples taken,name of the person taking the sample and performingfield measurements, and sample characteristics such astemperature, pH, total and free residual chlorine, andconductivity.  A field book also should be used torecord any field observations or conditions notedduring sampling along with other perti nent
information.  Each laboratory should identify a samplecustodian to log in and store samples collected duringthe TRE.  The sample custodian should acknowledgereceipt of samples by signing the COC form andnoting the date and time of sample receipt, the sampleidentification number, the laboratory assession code,and sampling information such as temperature, pH,and TRC.  Upon receipt of the sample, a sampletracking form should be used to record the date, time,and volume of aliquots of the sample removed foranalysis, the analyst, and any changes in the nature ofthe sample, including its toxicity, over time.  All COCand sample tracking forms should be maintained in apermanent file so that information on specific samplescan be traced easily.TRE Procedures
Analytical tests should provide data of an acceptablequality for characterizing wastewater toxicity and forevaluating methods and technologies for toxicityreduction.  Several test methods described in thisdocument are not standard procedures and requirecareful attention to unique QA/QC procedures.Special QA/QC procedures for each major TRE testare discussed below.  Whenever possible, theseprocedures should be followed to ensure precise andaccurate results.
Toxicity Identification Evaluation
Special precautions for TIE tests are discussed in thePhase I, II, and III manuals (USEPA 1991a, 1992a,
1993a, 1993b, 1996).  In general, strict adherence to
standard quality control practices is not required for
conducting Phase I analyses due to the large numberof toxicity tests to be performed and the tentativenature of the toxicant characterization.  Nonetheless,system blanks and controls should be used wheneverpossible to indicate toxicity artifacts caused by thecharacterization procedures.  In Phase II moreattention should be paid to quality control in order toidentify interferences in toxicant characterization andidentification.  Even greater attention to quality controlis needed in Phase III.  Sample manipulation s hould
be minimized in Phase III to prevent analyticalinterferences and toxicity artifacts.  Field replicates,system blanks, controls, and calibration standardsshould be used extensively to allow a precise andaccurate determination of the sample toxicants andtoxicity.
Specific precautions for characterization (Phase I) and
toxicity testing in TIE analyses are provided below.
Aeration
For air stripping or aeration tests, only a high qualitycompressed air source should be used.  Oil, water, anddirt are undesirable contaminants in compressed air;therefore, it is important to use equipment and filtersthat generate dry, oil-free air.  Oil-sealed aircompressors should not be used.  Simple aerationdevices, such as those sold for use with aquariums, areacceptable provided that the ambient laboratory air isuncontaminated (USEPA, 1991a).  Recommendationsfor in-line filters for air exchange systems inlaboratories are provided by USEPA (1993c).67Filtration
High purity water, which has been adjusted to a
specified pH, should be used to rinse filters betweenfiltration steps (USEPA 1991a, 1992a).  Filtrationequipment should be rinsed with 10% nitric acid(HNO
3), acetone, and high purity water between
sample aliquots.  Filtration equipment should be madeof plastic to avoid leaching of metals or other toxicantsduring acid washes.  Toxicity can be checked bytesting filtered dilution water.
pH Adjustments
Concerns in the pH adjustment steps involve artificialtoxicity caused by excessive ion concentrations fromthe addition of acid and base solutions, contaminationfrom impure acid and base solutions, and silvercontamination from some pH probes (USEPA 1991a,1992a).  The baseline toxicity test acts as a control forindicating whether addition of acid and base solutionsincreases effluent toxicity.  Ultra-pure acids and basesshould be used to minimize artificial toxicity.  DuringpH measurement, toxic concentrations of silver canleach from refillable calomel electrodes; therefore,only solid state pH probes should be used.
Methanol/C18 SPE Column
HPLC grade methanol is required for C18 SPEcolumn preparation and extraction steps.  A blanktoxicity test should be conducted for each methanolreagent lot.  In add ition, a toxicity blank should be
performed on each C18 SPE column to check forresin-related toxicity (USEPA 1991a, 1992a).
Sodium Thiosulfate Addition
The TIE manuals (USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1996)provide information on the toxicity of sodiumthiosulfate to several freshwater and marine species.These manuals prescribe the amount of sodiumthiosulfate to use in testing.  If alternative species areto be used, the species tolerance should be evaluatedby adding increasing quantities of sodium thiosulfateto aliquots of the sample, testing the resulting toxicity,and comparing the toxicity to the sample’s baselinetoxicity.
EDTA Addition
The TIE manuals (USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1996) also
prescribe the concentration of EDTA ligand to beadded to samples.  If alternative species are to be usedin the TIE, the same test approach noted above forsodium thiosulfate can be applied.Toxicity Tests
The organisms used to test the sample toxicity prior toand following each characterization step should not besubject to undue stresses such as contamination(USEPA, 1991a).  The test organisms should have hadno prior exposure to pollutants and their sensitivityshould be constant over time.  To assess changes in thesensitivity of the test organisms, a standard referencetoxicant test should be performed on a regular basisand accompanying quality control charts should bedeveloped (USEPA 1993c, 1994a, 1994b).  Referencetoxicant tests should be performed monthly.  If testorganism cultures are not maintained in the laboratory,reference toxicant tests should be performed with eachgroup of test organisms received, unless suchinformation is available from the vendor.  Informationon obtaining and culturing species for toxicity testingis provided in the acute and chronic toxicity testmanuals (USEPA 1993c, 1994a, 1994b).
The quality of the dilution water used in toxicity tests
will depend on the purpose of the TIE test and whetherthe test is being performed for toxicantcharacterization (Phase I), identification (Phase II), orconfirmation (Phase III).  Much of Phase I and parts ofPhase II rely on relative toxicity measurement;therefore, water that is of consistent quality and willsupport the growth and reproduction of the test speciesis suitable for these phases of the TIE (USEPA 1991a,1992a, 1996).  The objective of Phase III, however, is
to confirm the true cause of toxicity; therefore,artifacts are to be excluded and the choice of dilutionwater should follow Phase III guidance (USEPA,
1993b). Guidance for preparing the dilution waters isdescribed by USEPA (1991a, 1992a, 1996).
USEPA (1991a) recommends feeding cladocerans
(i.e., C. dubia and Daphnia sp.) in the TIE test
solutions at the beginning of acute TIE toxicity tests.Daily feeding is required in the chronic TIE tests(USEPA, 1992a).  Feeding requirements for selectedspecies are described in the acute and chronic toxicitytest manuals (USEPA 1993c, 1994a, 1994b, 1995).
Sample pH should be recorded at each sample
renewal. Additional pH measurements may be neededduring the test, especially if ammonia toxicity is aconcern.
DO measurements may be made at sample renewal or
at the end of the exposure period in the TIE.  In caseswhere low DO is a problem, DO adjustment should be68performed at a rate that will not intentionally c hange
the sample toxicity.
Refractory Toxicity Assessment and Treatability
Tests
RTA and treatability tests are subject to a variety of
potential interferences due to the large number ofvariables that must be accounted for and controlledduring testing.  When performing RTA and treatabilityanalyses, it is important to hold all parameterspotentially affecting toxicity constant so that sampletoxicity is the sole variable.  Important parameters tobe controlled in RTA testing include the test solutiontemperature, DO level, and pH.
The QA/QC concerns for toxicity analysis in RTA and
treatability tests are the same as those noted above forTIE tests. Selection and use of test species and dilutionwater should follow procedures given in the USEPAPhase I manual (USEPA 1991a, 1992a).
Potential sources of toxicity contamination should be
identified through the use of system blanks.  As in TIEtesting, the filters used in RTA testing should be testedto determine if toxicity is added during filtration.Each of the solutions used in RTA testing, includingactivated sludge, should be checked for toxicity.  Inthe Patapsco TRE, the RAS used in the RTA batchtests was found to be acutely toxic to C. dubia (Botts
et al., 1987).  Steps for addressing RAS toxicity aredescribed in Section 5.  Similarly, the reagents used intreatability testing such as chemical coagulants shouldbe screened for toxicity.
Field replicates, calibration standards, and analytical
replicates should be routinely performed during RTAand treatability testing.  Results of these qualitycontrol analyses can be used to calculate the precision,accuracy, and the sensitivity of each physical/chemical
analysis method used in these studies.
Chemical Analyses
Quality control for chemical analyses includes the useof calibration standards, replicate analyses, spikedsample analyses, and performance standards.  Thedetection limits and the recommended reagents formethod calibration and spiking are discussed inUSEPA’s Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water
and Wastes  (USEPA, 1983b) and Standard Methods
for Examination of Water and Wastewater  (APHA,
1995).  General information on laboratory qualitycontrol for chemical analyses is provided in USEPA’sHandbook for Analytical Quality Control in Water andWastewater Laboratories  (USEPA, 1979a).Equipment Maintenance
All facilities and equipment such as pH, DO, and
conductivity meters, spectr ophotometers, GC/MS, and
HPLC instruments should be inspected and maintainedaccording to manufacturers’ specifications.  Standardoperating procedures (SOP) should be followed forroutine maintenance and calibration of each analyticalinstrument.  A maintenance log book also should bekept for each major laboratory instrument.
The measurement of toxicity or trace compounds in
wastewater samples requires the use of carefullycleaned instruments and glassware.  Instruments thatinvolve flow-through analysis such as automatedspectrophotometers should be inspected to ensure thatflow-through parts (i.e., tubing) are periodicallyreplaced. New glassware may be contaminated withtrace amounts of metals; therefore, any glasswarebeing used in toxicity tests for the first time should besoaked for three days in 10% HNO
3 (USEPA, 1991a).
For subsequent use in TIE and toxicity tests, theglassware should be washed with phosphate-freedetergent, and sequentially rinsed with 10% HNO
3,
acetone, and finally high-purity water (USEPA 1993c,1994a, 1994b).
Documentation and Reporting of Data
Basic steps in a successful QA/QC program are thedocumentation of the analytical data in meaningful,exact terms, and reporting the analytical data in aproper form for future interpretation and use.  Toensure the reliability of the data, its handling must beperiodically monitored and reviewed.  This reviewgenerally consists of three elements: an assessment oflaboratory record-keeping procedures, a review of thedata calculations, and a review of the final reporteddata.  On the basis of these review steps and theQA/QC analyses for precision and accuracy, the dataare accepted or rejected.  This review process isessential because some or all records may have to besubmitted for review by State or Federal regulatoryagencies.
Corrective Action
Procedures should be established to ensure thatQA/QC problems such as improper samplingtechniques, inadequate COC records, and poorprecision and accuracy results are promptlyinvestigated and corrected.  When a QA/QCdeficiency is noted, the cause of the condition shouldbe determined and corrective action should be taken topreclude repetition.69Section 9
Health and Safety
Introduction
A health and safety (H&S) plan may be necessary to
establish policies and procedures to protect workersfrom hazards posed by TRE sampling and analytical
activities.  The general guidelines outlined in thissection should be integrated into existing H&Sprograms even if a specific H&S plan is not required.Whether a specific H&S plan is necessary or not willdepend on the conditions under which the TRE isbeing conducted.  For example, if the POTW operatesunder an RCRA permit by rule, then H&S must beaddressed when collecting and analyzing hazardouswastes.
Important considerations for H&S for TRE studies
include:
• Identification of personnel responsible for H&S
matters
• H&S information and training activities• Protective equipment required for TRE activities• Materials cleanup and disposal procedures• Emergency response contingencies.
Detailed information on the preparation and scope of
H&S plans is provided in the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration’s (OSHA’s) Safety and Health
Standards, General Industry  (OSHA, 1976).  The
following subsections discuss specific H&Sconsiderations for selected TRE activities.
Sample Collection and Handling
Working with waste streams of unknown compositionis inherent to TREs.  Samples of industrial sewerdischarges, municipal wastewater, and sewage sludgecan contain a variety of toxic and hazardous materials(e.g., pathogens, carcinogens) at concentrations thatcan be harmful to human health.It is the responsibility of the laboratory sample
custodian to ensure that TRE samples are properlystored, handled, and discarded after use (seeSection 8).  Upon sample storage, the samplecustodian should indicate the H&S considerations forsample handling and disposal.
Exposure to toxic and hazardous sample constituents
should be minimized during sampling handling.  Theprincipal routes of human exposure to toxics is viainhalation, dermal absorption, and/or accidentalingestion.  Exposure can be minimized through the useof proper laboratory safety equipment such as gloves,laboratory aprons or coats, safety glasses, respirators,and laboratory hoods.  Laboratory hoods are especiallyimportant when testing wastewaters containing toxicvolatile substances such as volatile priority pollutantcompounds, hydrogen sulfide, or hydrogen cyanide.Proper dermal protection such as using neoprenegloves for solvent-containing wastes also is important.Laboratory managers should consult themanufacturers’ specifications in selecting appropriateclothing materials for protection against specificchemicals.
Residual wastewater samples and wastes generated
during TRE studies should be disposed of properly.Residual municipal wastewater and other non-hazardous wastes can be disposed directly into the sinkdrain if the TRE is being conducted at the POTW.Residual industrial samples and other wastes that maycontain hazardous materials s hould be decontaminated
and/or disposed of in accordance with h azardous waste
regulations (NIOSH, 1977).
TRE Methods
Specific precautions to be followed for selected TREtechniques are described below.70Toxicity Identification Procedures (TIE)
USEPA’s TIE Phase I manuals (USEPA 1991a,
1992a, 1996) address the general H&S concernsinvolved in performing TIE testing.  Ventilation is aspecific concern when performing the Phase I aerationprocedure.  The aeration test s hould be performed in
laboratory hoods to prevent exposure to toxic volatilecompounds or pathogens resulting from aeration.
H&S considerations for aquatic toxicity testing are
addressed in USEPA’s toxicity test manuals (USEPA1993c, 1994a, 1994b, 1995).  Special precautions needto be taken for on-site mobile laboratories in thehandling and transportation of chemicals, supply ofadequate ventilation and safe electrical power, anddisposal of waste materials.
Refractory Toxicity Assessment and Treatability
Tests
Proper ventilation also is important when conducting
RTAs and treatability tests in the laboratory.  Hoodsshould be used to capture and vent potential volatilecompounds that are stripped from the wastewaterduring biological treatment tests.
Physical/chemical treatability testing may involve the
use of hazardous reagents such as acids or caustics.Caution should be taken in the handling and disposal
of these chemicals.
Chemical Analyses
Several reagents used for chemical-specific analyses(e.g., priority pollutants, COD, etc.) are toxic orhazardous substances.  Analysts should be familiarwith safe handling procedures for all reagents used intesting, including the practice of proper chemicalstorage to avoid storing incompatible chemicalstogether (NIOSH, 1977; OSHA, 1976).  After use, thewaste chemicals should be converted into a lesshazardous form in the laboratory before disposal ordisposed of by a commercial disposal specialist.
General Precautions
USEPA (1977) and the American Chemistry Society(1979) describe additional laboratory safety
procedures that can be used in TRE studies, including:
• Use of safety and protective equipment such as
eye protection (safety goggles, eye wash), firehazard protection (smoke and fire detectors, fireextinguishers), and electrical shock protection(ground-fault interrupters for wet laboratories).
• Protocols for emergency response and materials
cleanup.
• Personnel training in H&S procedures.71Section 10
Facilities and Equipment
Introduction
Laboratories should be equipped with all the basic and
specialized laboratory equipment required to conductthe TRE, and laboratory personnel should be skilledand experienced in operating this equipment.  Thefacilities and equipment needed to perform a TRE willbe different for each POTW and will depend on thetype of testing to be performed in the TRE.  In general,the minimum facilities and equipment for initiating aTRE will include the equipment needed for toxicityand TIE testing (USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1993c, 1994a,1994b, 1996).  As additional information becomesnecessary, facility and equipment needs will dependon the physical/chemical characteristics of thecausative toxicants and the toxicity control approachesto be evaluated.  For example, the selection of bench-scale equipment and/or pilot plant facilities fortreatability studies will be dictated by the controloptions to be tested (e.g., physical/chemical processessuch as filtration or biological processes).
The choice of whether to work on-site or off-site will
depend on the stage of the TRE, the approach fortracking sources of toxicants or toxicity, and therequirements for treatability testing.  In general, theequipment and time required for conducting TIE testsmakes on-site testing less feasible.  If the loss ofsample toxicity over time is minimal, TIE samples canbe shipped and tested off-site, usually at much lesscost than on-site testing.  If toxicity tracking usingRTA tests is required, on-site testing is recommendedfor the treatment phase of the RTA, because freshsamples of the POTW RAS biomass must be used.Treatability tests that require continuous supplies ofPOTW influent or process wastewaters and/oractivated sludge (i.e., flow-through bioreactor tests)also may be more efficiently conducted in on-sitefacilities.  Some treatability evaluations require uniqueor sophisticated equipment (e.g., ultra-filtrationapparatus) that is not readily available for on-sitework.  In these situations, the equipment vendor may
be able to conduct the required tests at their facility.
The general equipment requirements for each of the
main TRE methods are summarized below.  H&Sequipment is discussed in Section 9.
Toxicity Identification Evaluations
Laboratories should be equipped with the equipment
and materials needed to conduct the TIE, includingfiltration and air-stripping equipment, pH and DOmeters, C18 SPE columns, fluid metering pumps,required reagents for the TIE manipulations, andfacilities for organism handling, water preparation,sample holding, and glassware cleaning.  Equipmentrequirements for culturing standard test species aredescribed in USEPA’s acute and chronic toxicity testmanuals (USEPA 1993c, 1994a, 1994b, 1995).
More sophisticated analytical equipment is required
for the TIE Phase II toxicant identification and TIEPhase III toxicant confirmation procedures.  Thechoice of analytical instruments for these procedureswill depend on the compound to be measured.Equipment may include an analytical balance, aGC/MS, an HPLC, an atomic absorption (AA)spectrometer, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP)spectrometer, an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer(UV-VIS), an ion chromatograph, ion selectiveelectrodes, a pH meter, a conductivity meter, and arefractometer.  Use of inert materials such asperfluorocarbon plastics for TIE Phases II and III are
recommended to protect against toxicity artifacts(USEPA, 1991a).
Refractory Toxicity Assessment and
Treatability Tests
Laboratories should be equipped with the basic
equipment for setting up and operating the RTA batch72reactors, including an air supply, electrical supply, and
a laboratory hood.  Instruments for monitoring thebatch reactors include respirometer and/or oxygenmeter, pH meter, ion selective electrode meter andprobes, total TOC analyzer, spectrophotometer forCOD and nutrient (e.g., ammonia and nitrate)analyses.  A drying oven, muffle furnace, andanalytical balance will be needed for TSS and VSSmeasurements.
The equipment for toxicity testing will depend on the
choice of toxicity screening tests.  Depending on thespecies to be used, it may be more economical toculture the test organisms than to purchase them.  In
some cases, rapid screening tests such as a bacterialbioluminescence test (e.g., Microtox
®) may be used as
a surrogate method for toxicity testing (see theBillerica, Massachusetts, case history in Appendix A).
General Analytical Laboratory Equipment
General laboratory equipment such as refrigerators, awater purification system, and commonly usedreagents are needed to s upport the TIE and RTA
analyses.  The type of water purification systemneeded for testing is described by USEPA (1993c,1994a, 1994b, 1995).73Section 11
Sample Collection and Handling
Introduction
The most important criterion in sampling is to obtain
a sample that is representative of the discharge.Several samples will need to be collected to ensurethat the samples represent the typical toxicological andchemical quality of the wastewater. Guidelines forsample collection and handling are presented in theacute and chronic toxicity test manuals (USEPA1993c, 1994a, 1994b, 1995) and the Phase I TIE
documents (USEPA 1991a, 1992a, 1996).  The WEFalso has published a useful guide to sampling atPOTWs (WEF, 1996).
A sampling plan should be prepared to document the
procedures to be followed in TRE sampling.  This planshould include:
• A description of sampling locations
• Sampling equipment and methodology• Sample delivery requirements.
These elements are discussed in the following
subsections.  QA/QC procedures for sampling areaddressed in Section 8.  Procedures include preparingCOC forms, maintaining sampling equipment, andidentifying the minimum volume requirements,holding times, and preservation techniques forsamples.
Sampling Location
Sampling locations should be established whererepresentative samples can be readily obtained.  Whensampling waste streams within the POTW, care shouldbe taken to exclude unwanted waste streams and selecta sampling point that is most representative of thedischarge (e.g., the common discharge channel forsecondary clarifiers).  The sampling location for thePOTW effluent s hould correspond with the
biomonitoring sampling point stated in the NPDESpermit.  If the permit does not specify whether theeffluent sample is to be collected prior to or following
the chlorination/dechlorination treatment process, thechoice of a sampling location will depend on thetoxicants of concern.  Generally, sampling at the pointof final discharge is the best option; however,sampling both before and after chlorination/dechlorination may help to determine if toxicity iscaused by chlorination (i.e., TRC) or dechlorination.If samples are collected following the chlorinationprocess, free chlorine and TRC should be measuredwhen sampling is completed and upon initiation oftoxicity tests.  These results will provide informationon the potential for chlorine toxicity.
Wastewater sampling for toxicity source evaluations
requires knowledge of sewer discharge locations.Sampling may be conducted at the point of sewerdischarge or within the sewers in the municipal sewercollection system.  The choice of sampling points forsewer line tracking may be based on existingpretreatment program data.  If these data are notavailable, a sampling scheme can be devised to locatesources of toxicity by testing and eliminating segmentsof the collection system that prove to be non-toxic.  Insome cases, indirect dischargers may have multiplesewer discharges that need to be included whensampling.
RTA testing requires samples of the POTW influent
(primary effluent) and activated sludge.  Primaryeffluent samples should be collected at the overflowweirs of the primary sedimentation tanks.  Activatedsludge samples can be collected from the aerationbasin effluent weirs or the RAS pipelines.
POTW Sampling
The choice of grab or composite samples of POTWwaste streams (i.e., effluent and influent wastewaterand process waste streams) will depend on thephysical/chemical characteristics and variability of the74toxicants.  Initial effluent toxicity characterization
(TIE Phase I) should utilize 24-hour compositesamples in order to ascertain the daily, weekly, orseasonal variability of the causative agents.  If effluenttoxicity is not easily observed in 24-hour timecomposites, flow proporti onal composite or grab
samples may be used to observe possible flow-relatedpeaks of toxicity.  In the latter phases of the TIE, grabsamples may be used to determine the variability in thetype and concentration of effluent toxicants (USEPA1991a, 1992a).  A discussion of the use of grab versuscomposite sampling for toxicity tests is provided byUSEPA (USEPA 1993c, 1994a, 1994b, 1995).  Thechoice of sampling techniques for chemical-specificanalyses is dependent on the type of compounds to bemeasured (e.g., grab sampling for volatile organiccompounds).
When evaluating the treatment efficiency of the
POTW or its unit processes, collection of the influentand effluent wastewaters should be lagged by thehydraulic retention time (HRT) of the treatmentprocess in order to obtain comparable samples. Forexample, if the HRT of the treatment plant is 20 hours,the effluent sampler should be timed to start 20 hoursafter influent sampling is initiated.  Likewise,sampling of wastewater from industries or sewersshould account for the travel time in the collectionsystem (i.e., POTW influent sample collection shouldlag industry sample collection).
Samples also should be collected during representative
discharge periods.  An evaluation of the POTWoperations and performance at the time of samplingcan be made by comparing the effluent sampleconcentrations of BOD
5, TSS, and other pollutants to
long-term historical averages and/or permitted valuesfor those parameters.
Effluent samples are often collected, shipped, and
stored  in plastic containers.  However, some toxicantssuch as surfactants may adsorb to plastic.  A simpleway to check for this characteristic is to collect andship samples in both glass and plastic containers, thentest the samples for toxicity (USEPA, 1991a).  Agreater loss of toxicity in plastic containers ascompared to glass containers may indicate thepresence of toxic surfactants.
The sample volume requirements for TIE Phase I tests
are provided by USEPA (1991a, 1992a, 1996).Volume requirements for POTW samples that are used
in RTA tests are given in Section 5.
If TIE or physical/chemical treatability testing is being
conducted off-site, samples s hould be shipped on ice
to maintain the sample temperature at 4
oC.  RTA and
some biological treatability tests require fresh orcontinuous samples of POTW waste streams, whichrequires testing to be conducted on-site. Samples ofRAS and activated sludge should be delivered to theon-site laboratory and used immediately in testing toprevent changes in the biomass that can occur duringlong-term storage. Biomass samples should bevigorously aerated for a minimum of 15 minutesbefore use in the RTA or treatability tests.  POTWinfluent and process wastewater samples required foron-site RTA or treatability studies should be used onthe day of sample collection.
Sewer Discharge Sampling
The choice of grab or composite samples of indirectdischarges will depend on the physical/chemicalcharacteristics and variability of the toxicants.  Thesample type also will be dictated by the stage of thetoxicity source evaluation.  In Tier I testing, 24-hourflow proportional composite samples arerecommended to characterize daily variability whileaccounting for variations in flow.  Flow proportionalsampling should be scheduled to coincide withproduction schedules for industrial discharges, thefrequency of intermittent inputs for RCRA discharges,and the schedule of remedial activ ities for CERCLA
discharges.  This information is usually available inthe POTW’s pretreatment program reports.
Sampling techniques for flow proportional composites
should account for the potential loss of volatilecompounds.  For samples collected for chemicalanalysis or refractory toxicity testing, zero headspacesampling methods can be used to minimize volatilelosses.  In some cases, grab sampling may be used inlieu of zero headspace methods to reduce samplingcosts; however, care should be exercised in collectingsamples that are representative of the discharge.
In Tier II, grab sampling can be used in addition to
composite sampling to assess the variability of thetoxicants.  This type of sampling requires in-depthknowledge of the production schedules and thepretreatment operations of the discharger.75Section 12
