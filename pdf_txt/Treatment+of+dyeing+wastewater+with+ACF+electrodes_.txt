Abstract: Results of the electrochemical treatment of pulp and paper wastewater have been described. The 
electrolysis was conducted in static system on aluminium electrodes. The wastewater purification was carried 
out at two values of the current density 3.125 mA/cm 2and 6.25 mA/cm2. After electrocoagulation the COD, 
turbidity, suspended solids and color of the supernatant were measured. The fractal dimension of the 
aggregates-flocs of the sludge obtained was determined, too. The examined process of statical electro- 
coagulation turned out to be an efficient method for pulp and paper wastewater purification. The 
aggregates-flocs measured were recognized as self-simil objects. 
Keywords: electrocoagulation, pulp and paper wastewater, fractal dimension
Electrocoagulation is an increasingly popular method of wastewater treatment.
According to numerous authors, it is a highly effective technique for treating farming 
and industrial wastewater as well as municipal sewage from populated areas. The 
referenced sources describe attempts at the electrolytic treatment of wastewater from 
textile plants [1–3], fabric dyeing plants [4], tanneries [5], pulp and paper plants [6], as 
well as the use of the electrocoagulation process in theoretical models [7, 8]. In most 
cases, the discussed treatment technique involves Al or Fe electrodes [3, 9–11]. The 
findings of the cited studies suggest that electrochemical coagulation provides a viable 
alternative to conventional treatment methods involving chemical coagulation [7,
12, 13].
Owing to the specific production technology, the pulp and paper industry significant -
ly contributes to environmental pollution. It increases the total volume of dust and gas E C O L O G I C A L C H E M I S T RY AND ENGINEERING A

can be treated by biological and chemical methods, but the applied techniques often fall 
short of increasingly stringent criteria, in particular those pertaining to organic 
compound removal efficiency. Further research is required to develop improved 
methods that best suit various types of waste materials so as to optimize wastewater 
treatment efficiency in observance of the local conditions.
The characteristic features of sludge, including post-coagulation sludge, are an 
important consideration in the process of optimizing wastewater treatment methods. For 
this reason, the aim of this study was also to determine the fractal dimension D [14] of 
aggregates produced by electrocoagulation. Fractal dimension is a source of valuable 
information about the aggregation mechanism. The fractal nature of aggregates has been 
studied in various experiments. In a study investigating aggregates formed during 
biological treatment of water and sewage, Da Hong Li and Ganczarczyk [15] noted that 
aggregates comprising active sludge particles and particles washed out of the filter bed 
have fractal properties. Various morphological characteristics of such aggregates could 
be determined by their fractal dimension. Aggregates formed in a coagulation model 
involving silica suspension and aluminum coagulants were investigated by Smoczynki 
and Wardzynska [16]. Their fractal dimension was closely correlated with the
coagulants’ chemical properties. The aggregates produced in the process of electro- 
flocculation were studied by Harif and Adin [17].
This study presents the results of the static electrocoagulation process using 
aluminum electrodes as a method for treating wastewater from the pulp and paper 
industry.
Materials and methods
Pulp and paper wastewater was obtained from the pulp and paper plant in Swiecie.
The sampled wastewater was characterized by the following parameters: COD o=
731 mg O 2/dm3, turbidity – 1240 mg/dm 3, color – 240 mg/dm 3, suspended solids – 
75 mg/dm 3.
The static system for wastewater electrocoagulation comprised a pair of aluminum 
electrodes measuring 1 6×1×0.1cm,separatedbyadistanceof1cmandimmersedin 
a sewage tank. A self-designed control and supply system stabilized current intensity 
requiredfortheanalyzedprocessatI 1=50mAandI 2=100mA.Inthisexperiment,the 
densityofcurrentflowingthroughtheelectrodeswas /c1141=3.125mA/cm 2and/c1142=6.25 
mA/cm2. A pH-meter and a burette for dosing 1 M HCl were installed in the sewage 
tank to maintain wastewater pH at 5.5–6.0 [18]. Samples were collected at equal time 
intervals, and after sedimentation, COD, turbidity, color and suspended solids were
determined by spectrophotometry using a HACH DR 2000 spectrophotometer [19, 20].
Temperature and pH were measured with a HANNA HI 9025 pH meter.
The fractal dimension D of sludge aggregates produced in the treatment process was 
also determined during electrocoagulation. Fractal dimension values of the studied 
aggregates were measured 1 h after sedimentation. Fractal dimension was determined 
by the photographic method. The sedimentation path of aggregates formed by 912 BeataZa³êska-Chróstetalelectrocoagulation was photographed. The resulting images were used to determine the 
actual size (diameter) of flocs and their settling velocity, and to calculate the density 
“d”, of the examined aggregates. Fractal dimension was measured using Stokes’ law 
and the resulting correlation between an object’s density and its dimensions:
d ~ v / r 2(1)
where: d – density,
r – the object’s dimension,
v – settling velocity.
Because: M(r) ~ r D(2)
if D is the fractal dimension, M(r) – mass, then the following dependency can be 
obtained after a number of transformations:
log d = (D – 3) log r (3) 
Acomparisonbetweenformula(3)andthegeneralpowerlawy=ax /c97(a–amplitude, /c97
– exponent) indicates that exponent /c97, ie the expression (D – 3) for formula 3, is equal
to the logarithmic slope:
log d ~ f (log r) (4) 
The properties of 110 to 160 aggregates were measured for each process type. The 
collecteddatawereusedtomapalogarithmiccorrelation(4)(Fig.6and8)whoseslope 
produced the value of D.
Results
The results of electrocoagulation treatment of wastewater with initial COD oof 731 
mg O 2/dm3in a static system are presented below. The process was conducted at two 
current density values of /c1141= 3.125 mA/cm 2and/c1142= 6.25 mA/cm 2and at different
time intervals.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate changes in the quantity of pollutants removed during 
electrocoagulationovertimet=3600s.Analyticalsampleswerecollectedatequaltime 
intervals of 900 s. The effects of wastewater treatment, both at /c1141= 3.125 mA/cm 2and
/c1142= 6.25 mA/cm 2, were visible already after 900 s of electrolysis, and they were 
magnified in the course of the process. A similar drop in COD values reaching 
a maximum of around 65 % was noted at both current density levels. At higher current
densityappliedtotheelectrodes( /c1142),thepollutantsresponsibleforcolorandsuspended 
solids were removed at a faster rate. Turbidity decreased at a slower rate, and its 
removal was maintained at a relatively low level of approximately 62 % throughout the 
process. Various forms of waste purified by electrocoagulation probably remained in 
the solution, contributing to an increase in turbidity values.TreatmentofWastewaterfromthePulpandPaperIndustrybyElectrocoagulation... 913 In view of prior research and the results of the referenced studies, the following

the optimal time for wastewater treatment.
The correlation between the value of electric charge Q supplied to the solution and 
purification effectiveness, measured in terms of COD removal, was also determined 
(Fig. 5). The value of Q was calculated using formula Q = I /c215t (Q – charge, I – current
intensity) in terms of 1 dm 3of wastewater. The above correlation indicates that an 
increase in electrical charge from 0 to around 650 C/dm 3led to the continuous removal
of more than 60 % COD from the treated wastewater. In excess of the above value, no 
further progress was observed in COD removal.

The fractal dimension D of the resulting aggregates was determined in the range of 
1.55–1.90 for /c1141and 1.57–1.94 for /c1142. A proportional dependency was observed 
between the degree of wastewater purification and the value of D. The applied current
density influenced the effectiveness of treatment (% COD removal) and, consequently,
the value of D. The fractal dimension of aggregates in the treated wastewater is, to a 
varied extent, determined by the degree of sludge hydration. Lower values of D denote 
sludge characterized by a higher degree of hydration. With an increase in treatment
effectiveness,theproducedaggregatesweremarkedbygrowingvaluesofD.Theabove 
implies that the degree of sludge hydration decreased with an increase in the treatment
effectiveness of liquid-phase waste.

percentage share of flocs of a given size. Sludge that contained a higher percentage of 
small flocs was characterized by higher values of D. A higher content of small flocs in 
post-coagulation sludge decreases sludge hydration and promotes the filling of sludge

Conclusions
1. The process of static electrocoagulation of pulp and paper wastewater with the 
involvement of aluminum electrodes was found to be an effective treatment method. It
supported the removal of more than 60 % COD and a nearly complete elimination of 
color, turbidity and suspended solids from the treated wastewater.TreatmentofWastewaterfromthePulpandPaperIndustrybyElectrocoagulation... 919

noted at t = 1620 s and current density of /c1142= 6.25 mA/cm 2.
3. The actual size of aggregates and their sedimentation rate was r: 0.06–0.93 mm 
and v: 0.07–0.65 mm/s, respectively, indicating that aggregates maintain the same 
morphological properties, and that every sub-unit has identical characteristics to the 
entire aggregate.
4. The parameters that affect waste treatment, ie electrolysis time, current density 
applied to the electrodes and pH, also determine the aggregation mechanism by 
influencing the aggregates’ structure, size, shape and porosity and, consequently, the
fractal dimension D of post-coagulation sludge.
5. Small-sized flocs had the highest share of post-coagulation sludge. This attribute 
su pports the dewatering process because a higher contribution of small aggregates 
promotes the filling of sludge spaces with the solid phase.
