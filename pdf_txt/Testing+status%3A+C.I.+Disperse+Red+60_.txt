Criteria for Listing Agents, Substances or Mixtures in the Report on Carcinogens 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
National Toxicology Program 
Known to be Human Carcinogens:  
There is sufficient evidence of carcinogeni city from studies in humans, which 
indicates a causal relationship between exposure to the agent, substance or 
mixture and human cancer.  
Reasonably Anticipated to be Human Carcinogens: 
There is limited evidence of carcinogenic ity from studies in humans, which 
indicates that causal interpretation is cr edible but that alternative explanations 
such as chance, bias or confounding factor s could not adequately be excluded; or 
There is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals which indicates there is an incr eased incidence of malignant and/or a 
combination of malignant and benign tumors: (1) in multiple species, or at multiple tissue sites, or (2) by multiple routes of exposure, or (3) to an unusual degree with regard to incidence, site or type of tumor or age at onset; or 
There is less than sufficient evidence of  carcinogenicity in humans or laboratory 
animals, however; the agent, substance or mixture belongs to a well defined, 
structurally-related class of substances  whose members are listed in a previous 
Report on Carcinogens as either a known to be human carcinogen, or reasonably 
anticipated to be  human carcinogen or there is convincin g relevant information 
that the agent acts through mechanisms i ndicating it would likely cause cancer in 
humans. 
Conclusions regarding carcinog enicity in humans or experimental animals are based on 
scientific judgment, with consideration given to all relevant information. Relevant 
information includes, but is not limited to dose response, route of exposure, chemical 
structure, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, sens itive sub populations, genetic effects, or 
other data relating to mechanism of action or factors that may be unique to a given 
substance. For example, there may be subs tances for which there is evidence of 
carcinogenicity in laboratory animals but ther e are compelling data indicating that the 
agent acts through mechanisms which do not operate in humans and would therefore not 
reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans.

Executive Summary 
Introduction 
1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone (ADBAQ) is an anthraquinone vat dye that is used 
in the textile industry. It was nominated by the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Sciences based on the results of  the National Toxicolo gy Program two-year 
feeding studies, which concluded that ADBAQ was carcinogenic in rats and mice. 
Human Exposure Use. ADBAQ is used as a dye and as a dye in termediate. Anthraquinones are widely used 
as starting material for the manu facture of vat dyes, which are used in fibers and textiles, 
typically for cotton, wool, and cellulose acetate. 
Production . ADBAQ is prepared from 1-aminoant hraquinone by bromination in dilute 
mineral acids and is available from two vendors in the United States. Environmental Exposure . Because ADBAQ is not found naturally in the environment, 
any environmental exposure will be a result of releases from facilities where ADBAQ is 
produced or is used as an intermediate for production of other anthraquinone dyes. A 
dibromoaminoanthraquinone was found in ra w wastewater from a dye manufacturing 
plant in four of eight sample s at concentrations of 92 to  170 ppb but was not observed in 
final effluent. Occupational Exposure . Dermal exposure is the main  source of exposure to ADBAQ. 
Because ADBAQ is not very volatile, inhala tion exposure likely is limited to solid 
particulates. No specific occupationa l exposure information for ADBAQ or 
anthraquinone dyes in general was found in current literature. Epid emiological studies, 
however, indicate occupational e xposures to anthraquinone dyes  in a New Jersey dye and 
resin manufacturing plant. 
Human Cancer Studies 
Only two groups of workers exposed to anth raquinone dyes and intermediates have been 
investigated. All of the studies  of these workers have limitations that make detection of 
causal relationships difficult, including small size, potential exposure to multiple agents 
in the workplace, and lack of quantitative exposure data. In addition, the follow-up 
studies lack information on nonoccupational can cer risk factors. The results of the 
pertinent research are not consistent. Th e study of Scottish workers reported small 
increases in esophageal and prostate cancer and found no excess of respiratory cancer (64 
observed vs. 66.2 expected) or brain cancer (4/3.5 ). In contrast, the studies of New Jersey 
workers reported that work in anthraqui none dye operations was positively associated 
with lung cancer and with CNS tumors. In th e latter investigations , the results for CNS 
tumors were based on a very small number of observations. The data on anthraquinone 
dye operations and lung cancer were more  precise, and no confounding factor was 
identified that could explain the positive association. Thus, th e increase in lung cancer in 
anthraquinone dye workers at the New Jersey plant may have been due to occupational 
v  
 
  
 
 
 
 9/19/02 RoC Background Document for 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
exposure. However, the specific agent(s) responsible for the excess have not been 
identified. 
Studies in Experimental Animals 
In two-year dietary studie s with ADBAQ, male and female F344/N rats exhibited 
significantly increased incidences of neoplasms  of the liver, large intestine, kidney, and 
urinary bladder. Significant increases in the incidence of tumors of  the liver and large 
intestine (females only) also were observ ed in a 15-month stop-exposure study in rats. 
B6C3F 1 mice consuming ADBAQ-containing di ets for two years had increased 
incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma, squamous-cell papilloma and 
carcinoma of the forestomach, and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and carcinoma of the lung. The NTP report concluded that “under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, 
there was clear evidence for carcinogenic activity of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
in male and female F344/N rats based on incr eased incidences of neoplasms in the liver, 
large intestine, kidney, and urinary bladder. There was clear evidence for carcinogenic 
activity of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in male and female B6C3F
1 mice based on 
increased incidences of neoplasms in the liver, forestomach, and lung.” 
Genotoxicity 
ADBAQ was mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strains that revert by frameshift mutations, 
and the mutagenicity was decreased or elimin ated in the presence of induced hamster or 
rat liver S9 metabolic activation. ADBAQ did not induce detectable mutations at the tk 
locus in mouse lymphoma cells; however, the concentrations used (20 or 25 μg/mL) were 
less than those used for the S. typhimurium  assays (100 to 10,000 μg/mL) and slightly 
less than those used to asse ss clastogenicity (up to 100 μg/mL of ADBAQ). In CHO 
cells, ADBAQ induced chromosomal aberrations  and SCE without metabolic activation; 
however, the results were inconsistent between different trials and laboratories. 
Forestomach and lung tumors induced  by ADBAQ had a higher frequency of ras 
mutations than did spontaneous tumors. In particular, CAA to CTA transversions were 
common in ADBAQ-induced tumors but were ab sent in spontaneous tumors. The results 
obtained with ADBAQ must be viewed in the light of the limited solubility of this 
molecule and the uncertain purity  of the preparations tested. 
Other Relevant Data 
Absorption, excretion, and metabolism.  In rats, ADBAQ is rapidly absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract and distributed ra pidly and widely to most soft tissues. 
Approximately 97% of ADBAQ is metabolized , as demonstrated by the small amount 
(less than 3%) of radiolabel recovered as the parent compou nd from either blood or urine; 
however, the metabolites of ADBAQ have not been identified. ADBAQ and its 
metabolites are excreted primar ily in the feces and urine. 
Potential mechanisms.  ADBAQ and other anthraquinones are classified with a large 
number of other quinone molecu les that can be derived from aromatic molecules such as 
benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene. R eactive oxygen species generated by metabolism 
of a variety of quinones may be associated with DNA damage or activation of signaling pathways involved in initiation, promotion, a nd progression of carcinoge nesis. Four other 
anthraquinone vat dyes evalua ted by the NTP have been listed in the RoC as reasonably

1 Introduction 
1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone (ADBAQ) is an anthraquinone vat dye that is used 
in the textile industry and is a member of a class of insoluble dyes that are impregnated 
into textile fibers. ADBAQ was nominated by the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Sciences (NIEHS) for possible listing in the Report on Carcinogens (RoC) based 
on a National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioa ssay (TR-383) reporting clear evidence of 
carcinogenicity in rats and mice. The NTP st udied the carcinogenicity of ADBAQ as part 
of a class study with five other anthraqui none-derived dyes with representative and 
diverse structures, for the purpose of predicting the carcinogeni city of chemicals in this 
class. The conclusions from the NTP’s two- year feeding study of ADBAQ were that 
there was clear evidence of  carcinogenic activity in male and female F344/N rats 
(neoplasms in the liver, large intestine, kidney, and urinary bladder) and in male and 
female B6C3F 1 mice (neoplasms in the liver, forestomach, and lung). 
1.1 Chemical identification 
ADBAQ (C 14H7Br2NO 2, mol wt 381.02, CASRN 81- 49-2) is a substituted anthraquinone 
with a single primary amine located in th e 1-position and two bromine atoms located 
ortho and para to the amino group. Synony ms for ADBAQ include 1-amino-2,4-dibromo­
9,10-anthracenedione; 1-amino-2,4-dibroman thrachinon; anthraquinone, 1-amino-2,4­
dibromo-; and 2,4-dibromo-1-anthraquinonyl amine. Its RTECS number is CB5500000. 
The structure of ADBAQ is shown in Figure 1-1.

2 Human Exposure 
2.1 Use 
ADBAQ is used as a dye and as a dye inte rmediate (NTP Chemical Repository 2001). 
Anthraquinones are widely used as starting ma terial for the manufacture of vat dyes. Vat 
dyes are a class of water-insoluble dyes that can easily be reduced to a water-soluble and 
usually colorless form. In this form, they can readily be impregnated into fibers and 
textiles. Oxidation then produces an insoluble colored form that is remarkably fast to 
washing, light, and chemicals. Vat dyes typically are used for cotton, wool, and cellulose acetate. 
2.2 Production 
ADBAQ is prepared from 1-aminoanthraquinon e by bromination in dilute mineral acids 
(HSDB 2000). ADBAQ was found to be availabl e from two vendors in the United States: 
Pfaltz and Bauer, in Connecticut, and Alfa Aesar, in Massachusetts (ChemFinder 2001). 
U.S. production of vat dyes totaled 14 million kilograms (30.8 million pounds) in 1991 
(NTP 1996). 
2.3 Analysis 
ADBAQ has been analyzed in various samples by gas chromatography/flame ionization 
detection and gas chromatography/mass spec trometry (Games and Hites 1977). Recently, 
several other analytic al methods have been describe d for detecting and quantifying 
anthraquinone-type dyes (liquid chromat ography/nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography 
[HPLC]); however, ADBAQ has not been  analyzed by these methods (Preiss et al.  2000, 
Novotná  et al.  1999). 
2.4 Environmental occurrence 
ADBAQ is not known to be naturally forme d. Production of ADBAQ an d its subsequent 
use as an intermediate in th e production of anthraquinone dyes may result in releases into 
the environment (HSDB 2000). No information was found in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Toxic Release I nventory regarding ADBAQ (TRI 2001). 
2.5 Environmental fate 
ADBAQ is sensitive to long-term exposure to  light and air (NTP Chemical Repository 
2001). Although ADBAQ was found in raw wastewater of a dye manu facturing plant, it 
was not present in the final e ffluent (effluent into the Cooper River, which flows into 
Charleston Bay of the Atlantic Ocean) (Games  and Hites 1977). This may indicate that 
ADBAQ was either biodegraded or adsorbed  to sludge during treatment (HSDB 2000). 
2.5.1 Air 
Based on estimated vapor pre ssure, ADBAQ should exist as a solid particulate in the 
ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase ADBAQ  would be removed from the atmosphere 
by dry deposition (HSDB 2000).

2.5.2 Water 
ADBAQ may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water. The amino group in 
ADBAQ also may bind covalently with active site s in sediment and particulate matter. It 
is not expected to volatilize from water surf aces. The estimated partition coefficients and 
a recommended regression-derived equation we re used to calculate a bioconcentration 
factor of 6,400 for ADBAQ. This suggests th at ADBAQ will bioconcentrate in aquatic 
organisms (HSDB 2000). 
2.5.3 Soil 
ADBAQ is expected to be immobile in so il; its mobility may be limited because the 
amino group may bind to active si tes in the soil. Vo latilization is not expected to occur 
from either moist or dr y soil surfaces (HSDB 2000). 
2.6 Environmental exposure 
Because ADBAQ is not found naturally in the environment, any environmental exposure 
will be a result of releases from facilities where ADBAQ is produced or is used as an 
intermediate for production of other anthra quinone dyes. A dibromoaminoanthraquinone 
was found in raw wastewater from a dye manufacturing plant in four of eight samples at concentrations of 92 to 170 ppb but was not observed in final effluent (HSDB 2000).   
2.7 Occupational exposure 
Dermal exposure is the main source of exposure to ADBAQ. Because ADBAQ is not very volatile, inhalation e xposure likely is limited to solid particulates. Ikeda et al.  (1977) 
found that workers exposed to dyes (as evid enced by diazo-positive metabolites in their 
urine) had many dye stains on their hands, wrists , and forearms. Analyses of the air in the 
workroom environments were not conducted. 
No specific occupational exposure informa tion for ADBAQ or anthraquinone dyes in 
general were found in current literature. Epidemiological studies, however, indicate 
potential occupational exposures to anthraqu inone dyes in a New Jersey dye and resin 
manufacturing plant. A cohor t study followed more than 3,000 workers who may have 
been exposed to anthraquinone dyes (Sathi akumar and Delzell 2000). Results of this 
study are described in Section 3.  
2.8 Biological indices of exposure 
No indices of ADBAQ exposure in humans or animal models were found in current 
literature. 2.9 Regulations 
No regulations specifically for ADBAQ were identified.

3 Human Cancer Studies 
No study has evaluated the relationship betw een human cancer and specific exposure to 
ADBAQ; however, exposure to anthraquinone dy es as a class has been studied. Since the 
late 1880s, the dye manufacturing industry has used a large number of anthraquinones 
and aromatic amines (arylamines) to synthe size industrial colorants and has used nitro 
aromatic amines to make hair dyes. Re latively little is known about the human 
carcinogenicity of anthraquinone dyes. The NTP classifies 2-am inoanthraquinone, 1­
amino-2-methylanthraquinone, 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, and 1,4,5,8­
tetraaminoanthraquinone as reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens.  The 
International Agency for Research on Can cer (IARC) lists 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone, 
2-methyl-1-nitroanthraquinone, and 1,4,5,8-tetraaminoanthraquinone as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) and consid ers 2-aminoanthraqui none and 1-amino-2­
methylanthraquinone not classifiable as to ca rcinogenicity to humans (Group 3). Neither 
the NTP nor IARC has evaluated the carcinogeni city of anthraquinone dyes as a chemical 
category or anthraquinone dye manufact uring as an exposure circumstance. 
3.1 Human epidemiological studies 
Data on the carcinogenicity to humans of dye s and chemicals used in synthesizing dyes 
come mainly from studies of workers in ma nufacturing plants. These groups of workers 
typically were exposed to many different ch emicals and classes of chemicals, often 
making it difficult to attribute observed carcinoge nic effects to a single agent. Only five 
epidemiologic studies of workers potentia lly exposed to anthraquinone dyes and 
anthraquinone dye intermediates are available. One of these investigations evaluated mortality among workers at a plant in Scot land that mainly made anthraquinone dyes 
(Gardiner  et al.  1982). Each of the other four studies pertains to the same group of 
workers at a plant in New Jersey (Barbone  et al.  1992, 1994, Delzell  et al.  1989, 
Sathiakumar and Delzell 2000). The New Jersey  plant’s manufacturing operations were 
more diverse than those of the plant in Scotland and included the production of 
anthraquinone, anthraquinone dye interm ediates and dyes, epichlorohydrin, azo dye 
intermediates and dyes, epoxy resins , and a variety of additives.  
3.1.1 Study of Scottish anthraquinone dyestuffs workers 
Gardiner et al. (1982) evaluated mortality from  various causes among 1,975 men 
employed at an anthraquinone dyestuffs plan t for at least six months between 1956 and 
the end of 1965. Personnel records were used to identify all subjects who had worked in jobs that entailed potential exposure to s ubstituted anthraquinones. The study excluded 
men who had worked exclusively in cler ical, accounting, and personnel management 
positions. Vital status and cause of death as of the end of June 1980 were determined for about 97% of the subjects through the use of  plant records and da ta from the National 
Records Offices of Edinburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne. Analyses compared workers’ 
mortality rates with those of the general male population of Scotland in 1975, adjusting 
for age and using the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) (ratio of observed to expected 
numbers of deaths, multiplied by 100) as th e measure of association. An SMR of 100 
implies that the mortality rate of workers wa s the same as that of  the general population, 
after analytic adjustment for any difference in  the age distributions of these two groups. 
7
  
 
  
 9/19/02 RoC Background Document for 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
Gardiner et al. (1982) found that workers at the plant had about 23% fewer deaths from 
all causes combined than expected on the basis of general population rates (470 observed 
vs. 611.5 expected deaths, SMR = 76.9). Workers also had fewer deaths than expected 
from cerebrovascular disease (36/66.5, SM R = 54.1), cardiovascular disease (188/235.6, 
SMR = 79.8), and all cancers combined (129/ 149.7, SMR = 86.2). There were at least 5 
observed or expected deaths for eight specif ic types of cancer. Among these, there were 
more deaths than expected for cancer of the esophagus (6/4.3) and fewer deaths than 
expected for cancer of the stomach (14/18.1), in testinal tract (7/11.0) , pancreas (4/6.8), 
bladder (4/5.6), respiratory system (64/66.2), prostate (4/8.0), and rectum (6/6.8). None 
of these differences was statistically significant. 
The mortality rate for all cancer combined was higher than expected for workers in some 
areas of the plant. Gardiner et al. (1982) did not present de tailed results for specific 
cancers by plant area but noted statisitcally significant excesses of cancer of the esophagus in the engineering department (all deaths from this cancer were among men in 
this department) and cancer of the prostate in one particular process area. Workers’ 
respiratory cancer rates were not statistically significantly greater than expected in any 
plant area. Work activities in the engineeri ng department were not  thoroughly described 
but presumably included main tenance operations. Gardiner et al. (1982) indicated that 
engineering workers constituted 45% of the study group, that they worked mainly in proximity to plant process areas , and that their plant exposur es probably were similar to 
those of process workers. The authors could no t interpret their results for prostate cancer. 
They stated that cadmium, a suspected cause of  prostate cancer, was not used at the plant. 
Gardiner et al. (1982) stated that their research did not provide any evidence of “an 
abnormal pattern of mortality” in the group of anthraquinone dye workers studied. 
Because of its methodologic weaknesses, the st udy provided little evidence either for or 
against the hypothesis that anthraquinones cause cancer in  humans. Limitations were the 
small numbers of deaths for most specific types of cancer, the l ack of quantitative 
estimates of exposure to anthraquinones or other chemicals, and the lack of data on 
nonoccupational factors. Moreover, the very low SMR for all causes of death combined, 
especially in older age gr oups, which probably contained a high proportion of inactive 
workers, suggests that ascertainment of  deaths in the study group may have been 
incomplete or that the use of comparison rates derived from a single year (1975) was inappropriate. If so, all SMRs may have been underestimated. 
3.1.2 Studies of dye and resin manufacturing workers at a plant in New Jersey 
Delzell et al. (1989) conducted a retrospective fo llow-up study of mortality from 1952 
through 1985 among 2,642 white men who had been employed for at least six months at a dye and resin plant in New Jersey. Barbone  and colleagues carried out nested case-
control studies of lung cancer (Barbone  et al. 1992) and central nervous system (CNS) 
tumors (Barbone  et al. 1994) occurring among these workers. In a later investigation, 
Sathiakumar and Delzell (2000) expanded th e original retrospective follow-up study 
(Delzell  et al.  1989) to include 3,266 male and female  workers of all races and evaluated 
their mortality patterns during the period 1952 through 1995. 
8
  
 
  
 9/19/02 RoC Background Document for 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
The manufacturing operations of the New Jers ey plant took place in three major areas. 
Operations in the “south dye area” (ant hraquinone dye/epichlorohydrin area) included 
anthraquinone production (1952 to 1983), anthraquinone dye production (1952 to 1983), 
anthraquinone dye intermediates produc tion (1952 to 1983), formulation of 
anthraquinone dyes (1952 to late 1980s),  and epichlorohydrin production (1961 to 1965). 
The “north dye area” produced azo dyes and intermediates from 1959 to the late 1980s. 
The plastics and additives area made epoxy resins, fabric softeners, water-repellent agents, optical brighteners, and various additives from 1959 to the late 1980s. Raw 
materials and intermediates used in each ar ea included many chemicals, some of which 
are known carcinogens (e.g., benzene, benz idine, ethylene oxid e) or suspected 
carcinogens (e.g., epichlorohydrin, formaldehyde, dimethyl sulfate). Chemicals used in 
the anthraquinone dye/epi chlorohydrin (AQ/ECH) ar ea included anthracene, 
anthraquinones, anthraquinone sulfonates, anthraquinone intermediates, aniline, substituted aniline, benzene, nitrobenzene, chlorobenzenes, chlorotoluenes, pyridine, 
tetrachloroethylene, chlorine, ammonia, ar senic acid, methanol, sulfuric acid, and 
mercury. 
3.1.2.1 Original retrospective follow-up study 
The first investigation of workers at th e New Jersey plant used company personnel 
records to identify all white men with at least six months of employme nt as of the end of 
1984 and to develop information on each subj ect’s jobs at the facility (Delzell et al. 
1989). Plant records and linkages with several national and state databases established the 
vital status of 96% of the 2,642 eligible subjects as  of the end of 1985. Death certificates 
provided information on deceased subjects’ cau ses of death. Comparisons of workers’ 
mortality rates with those for the white male  general population of the United States 
yielded observed and expected numbers of deaths for the overall study group and subgroups of hourly workers classified by the process area(s) in which they had worked 
for at least one year. 
The overall study group had 357 deaths from all causes combined, compared with 440 
expected deaths (SMR = 81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 73 to 90), and 106 cancer 
deaths, compared with 97 expected can cer deaths (SMR = 109, 95% CI = 89 to 132). 
There were more deaths from CNS cancer than  expected (5/3.3), not including the deaths 
of two employees from this cancer while livi ng in Europe, and there were 3 deaths each 
from bladder cancer (expected = 2.3) and ki dney cancer (expected = 2.5). The paper did 
not include results for other specific types of cancer for the overall study group. 
The study included 588 hourly employees who had worked in the AQ/ECH area for at 
least one year. These men had fewer deaths than expected from all causes combined (65/97) and from cancer (20/22) . For all specific types of can cer, observed and expected 
numbers of deaths were under 10 and were too small to yield st atistically stable results. 
Hourly AQ/ECH workers had 6 lung cancer deaths (expected = 8). Although only 44 
workers in this area had been employed in epichlorohydrin operations, and most of these 
also had worked longer in anthraquinone dye operations, this gr oup had statistically 
significantly more lung cancer deaths than expected (4/0.91, P = 0.03). 
9
  
 
  9/19/02 RoC Background Document for 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
Hourly maintenance workers (N = 514), many of whom were employed throughout the 
plant, had more deaths than expected from all cancers combined (37/25, SMR = 148, 
95% CI = 103 to 202), from lung cancer (1 8/9.2, SMR = 196, 95% CI = 116 to 309), and 
from liver cancer (3/0.46).  
The investigators concluded that the excess of lung cancer  among maintenance workers 
could have been due to an unidentified o ccupational exposure. They noted that the 
association they observed between epichlor ohydrin and lung cancer had not been found 
in research on other, larger groups of workers exposed to this chemical. 
The study was limited by the small number of  subjects and of deaths in the AQ/ECH 
work group. Other weaknesses were the absen ce of quantitative exposure estimates or 
data on nonoccupational risk factors. However, even if such data had been available, the 
study would have had little power to assess dose response, confounding, or interaction for 
specific forms of cancer. 
3.1.2.2 Case-control study of lung cancer. 
Barbone et al . (1992) conducted a nested case-contro l study of lung cancer that included 
as cases 51 white male employees of the New Jersey plant who had died of or developed 
primary lung cancer by October 1988. Controls were 102 individually matched 
employees chosen randomly from among other white male employees who were born in 
the same year and were alive as of the case subject’s death or dia gnosis date. Plant job 
records identified each process area and building in whic h a subject had carried out 
production-related work. The AQ/ECH area c onsisted of five buildings with the 
following operations: (1) anthraquinone produc tion, (2) production of anthraquinone dye 
intermediates, (3) anthraquinone  dye synthesis, (4) anthraquinone dye standardization, 
and (5) epichlorohydrin producti on. Interviews with long-term  employees (not subjects) 
provided more detailed work history informa tion on building-specific work, as well as an 
ordinal score for subjects’ pot ential exposure to asbestos an d epichlorohydrin. Interviews 
with subjects or family members furnishe d data on smoking and on jobs and exposures 
outside the New Jersey plant and were comple ted for 69% of cases and 74% of controls. 
Plant medical records, available for 67% of cases and 68% of controls, supplied 
information on smoking and exposures to chemi cals that had been re ported to the plant 
medical department. The odds ratio (OR) (the ra tio of the rates of lung cancer in subjects 
exposed and not exposed to a given factor) was used as the measure of association. 
As expected, smoking was positively and consis tently associated with lung cancer. Lung 
cancer also was positively associated with ever having worked in the AQ/ECH area 
(OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.2), based on 21 exposed cases and 24 exposed controls. 
This association was limited to subjects who had worked in the area for at least 10 years (smoking-adjusted OR = 4.6, 95% CI = 0.9 to 23), but there was no tr end of increasing 
OR with increasing time spent in the area. Lung cancer was positively associated with 
employment in each of the five building- specific operations in the area, but the 
association was statistically significant only for anthraqu inone production (OR = 12, 95% 
CI = 1.4 to 99) and was of borderline stat istical significance for anthraquinone dye 
standardization (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.0 to 11). The positive association between work in the AQ/ECH area and lung cancer did not appear to be due to exposure to asbestos or 
10
  
 
  9/19/02 RoC Background Document for 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
epichlorohydrin or to smoking. Results for other process areas we re not striking or 
statistically significant. 
Workers in the AQ/ECH area potentially were exposed to chlorine and to 
epichlorohydrin, in addition to  anthraquinone dyes and intermediates. The study reported 
a positive association between  acute exposure to chlori ne and lung cancer (OR = 5.7, 
95% CI = 1.1 to 30). Adjustment for smoking ra ised the OR for chlorine to 27, but these 
results were based on only 6 exposed cases  and 3 exposed controls. Chlorine was 
encountered in the AQ/ECH area by 3 of the 6 chlorine-exposed case subjects and 2 of 
the 3 chlorine-exposed control subjects. A positive [but not statistically significant] association between lung cancer and exposur e to epichlorohydrin (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 
0.7 to 4.1) was reported, based on 12 exposed cas es and 18 exposed controls. The latter 
association was restricted to workers with  short-term and relatively low exposure to 
epichlorohydrin. Only 3 of the 21 case s ubjects in the AQ/ECH area had spent any 
appreciable time in epichlorohydrin operations. 
Barbone et al . (1992) noted that the positive association between lung cancer and 
anthraquinone dye operations could have been due to occupational exposure (to 
anthraquinone or other chemicals used in the area) or to chance. The study lacked data on 
cumulative exposure to anthraquinones. If anthraquinones cause lung cancer, the lack of 
an association between durati on of employment in the vari ous anthraquin one areas and 
lung cancer in this study could have been due to poor correlati on between duration of 
work in the areas and amount of exposure. Th e study also did not have quantitative or 
comprehensive data on exposure to chlo rine and had only crude estimates of 
epichlorohydrin exposure. Thus, the impact of  these agents on the association between 
anthraquinone work areas and lung cancer may not have been accurately assessed. 
Barbone et al . (1992) noted that the only other data available on human exposure to 
anthraquinones, the study by Gardiner et al. (1982), did not find an excess of lung cancer 
among workers with po tential exposure. 
3.1.2.3 Case-control study of central nervous system tumors 
The case-control study of CNS tumors included as cases 11 white male employees who 
were known to have died of or developed a primary CNS tumor by October 1988 (7 with 
astrocytoma or glioblastoma, 2 with meningioma, and 2 with a benign tumor) (Barbone  et 
al. 1994). Controls were 44 individually matc hed subjects chosen  randomly from among 
other white male employees who were born in th e same year and were alive as of the case 
subject’s death or diagnosis date. Procedures  for obtaining and clas sifying work history 
data, estimating exposure to epichlorohydrin, conducting interviews, and obtaining data 
from plant medical records were similar to those used in the cas e-control study of lung 
cancer (Barbone  et al. 1992). Interviews, completed for 73% of cases and 84% of 
controls, asked about non-plant jobs and occupational e xposures, smoking habits, and 
history of head trauma, irradi ation to the head, epilepsy, and use of antiepileptic drugs. 
The occurrence of CNS tumors was statistica lly significantly and positively associated 
with anthraquinone dye intermediate producti on, but only 3 case subj ects and no controls 
had worked in this process area. Positive asso ciations also were found with work in the 
epoxy resin process area and in the azo dye  area and with estimated exposure to 
11
  
 
 9/19/02 RoC Background Document for 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
epichlorohydrin. Barbone et al. (1994) reported that the a ssociation with anthraquinone 
dye intermediate production was “nonindepende nt” of the association with exposure to 
epichlorohydrin and concluded that the sma ll study size precluded fi rm conclusions about 
the causes of CNS tumors in the plant workfo rce. All of the results were based on small 
numbers of exposed subjects and were quite  imprecise. The study also did not include 
quantitative estimates of exposure to anthraqu inone or other chemicals and was not able 
to evaluate anthraquinone dose response or to adequately assess the possibility that the 
association between anthraquinone dye inte rmediate production and CNS tumors was 
confounded by the other positive associations observed, or vice versa. 
3.1.2.4 Retrospective follow-up study update 
Sathiakumar and Delzell (2000) expanded and updated the original study by Delzell et al. 
(1989), adding women and nonwhite men to  the study group and extending follow-up 
through the end of 1995. The expanded study compared the mortality rates for 3,266 
employees with the age-, race-, gender-, a nd time-period-specific rates for the general 
population of New Jersey. 
The total study group had 728 observed and 809.8 expected deaths from all causes 
combined (SMR = 90, 95% CI = 83 to 97), 225 observed and 231.7 expected total cancer 
deaths (SMR = 97, 95% CI = 85 to 111), 89 observed and 73.2 expected lung cancer deaths (SMR = 122, 95% CI = 98 to 150), a nd 8 observed and 6.0 expected CNS cancer 
deaths (SMR = 134, 95% CI = 58 to 264). White male employees who had worked in the AQ/ECH area (N = 842) had an excess of lung cancer, based on 32 observed and 19.1 
expected deaths (SMR = 168, 95% CI = 115 to  237), and had 3 deat hs from CNS cancer 
(1.5 expected, SMR = 205, 95% CI = 42 to 598). Maintenance workers at the plant also 
had more deaths from lung cancer than e xpected (40/26.2, SMR = 153, 95% CI = 109 to 
208). 
The lung cancer excess among workers in the AQ/ECH area was not consistently larger 
in subgroups with long duration of employment (5 years or  more) or long potential 
induction time in the area (20 years or mo re); however, small numbers limited the 
conclusions that could be drawn from these su bgroup analyses. In analyses that compared 
the lung cancer mortality rate of AQ/ECH area workers with that of other plant 
employees, adjusting for age, calendar time, and employment in maintenance operations, 
the OR was 1.7 (95% CI = 1.1 to 2.6) for the AQ/ECH area, confirming the increased 
lung cancer mortality for this area seen in the SMR analysis.  This study, like the study of the same workforce by Barbone et al. (1992), found a 
positive association between employment in anthraquinone dye operations and lung 
cancer. There was no discernible trend of increasing lung cancer SMR or OR with 
increasing length of employment in anthra quinone dye operations, but this could be 
explained by poor correlation between durati on of employment and cumulative exposure 
to anthraquinones or other chemicals used in  the area. Sathiakuma r and Delzell (2000) 
also found an increase in CNS cancer among workers potentially exposed to 
anthraquinones, based on small numbers,  consistent with the report by Barbone et al. 
(1994). 
12
  
 
  9/19/02 RoC Background Document for 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
Compared with the previous follow-up study of this group of workers, the update had 
72% more person-years and twice as many observed deaths. The median length of 
follow-up was 27 years, and 22% of the work ers were deceased. However, numbers of 
deaths from specific types of cancer were sm all in the work-area-specific analyses, and 
the update lacked direct exposure estimate s and data on nonoccupational risk factors. 
These limitations impede the detection of causal associations. 
3.2 Summary 
Only two groups of workers exposed to anth raquinone dyes and intermediates have been 
investigated. All of the studies  of these workers have limitations that make detection of 
causal relationships difficult, including small size, potential exposure to multiple agents 
in the workplace, and lack of quantitative exposure data. In addition, the follow-up 
studies lack information on nonoccupational can cer risk factors. The results of the 
pertinent research are not consistent. Th e study of Scottish workers reported small 
increases in esophageal and prostate cancer and found no excess of respiratory cancer (64 
observed vs. 66.2 expected) or brain cancer (4/3.5 ). In contrast, the studies of New Jersey 
workers reported that work in anthraqui none dye operations was positively associated 
with lung cancer and with CNS tumors. In th e latter investigations , the results for CNS 
tumors were based on a very small number of observations. The data on anthraquinone 
dye operations and lung cancer were more  precise, and no confounding factor was 
identified that could explain the positive association. Thus, th e increase in lung cancer in 
anthraquinone dye workers at the New Jersey plant may have been due to occupational 
exposure. However, the specific agent(s) responsible for the excess have not been identified. Table 3-1 summarizes the human cancer studies on anthraquinone dye workers.

4 Studies of Cancer in Experimental Animals 
The NTP (1996) carried out studies in male  and female rats and mice in which ADBAQ 
was administered in the diet continuously for either 13 weeks or two years. In addition, 
the NTP conducted a 15-month high-dose stop-ex posure study in rats (9 months of 
exposure to ADBAQ followed by 6 months on a control diet). Data from the 13-week 
studies in rats and mice we re reported by Fleischman et al.  (1986), and results from the 
two-year studies in rats  were reported by Harada et al. (1989) and Maronpot et al. 
(1989a). The results of the NTP studies  and additional experiments by Maronpot et al. 
(1989b) are summarized below. 
The NTP obtained two lots of ADBAQ for the studies and confirme d the identity and 
purity of each lot by chemical analysis. Fleischman et al. (1986) reported that the study 
material was technical-grade ADBAQ of 80%  to 85% purity, determined by HPLC. The 
major impurities were identified as anthraquinone (9.3%) and either 
2-aminodibromoanthraquinone or a different 1-aminodibromoanthraq uinone (4.7%). The 
same material was used for the first 2 months  of the two-year studi es. The study material 
used for the remaining 22 months of the two- year studies was found to be approximately 
97% pure, with six unidentified impurities.  
Little information is available on the potential carcinogenicity of the three contaminants 
identified in the initial ADBAQ sample. An thraquinone has not been reviewed in an 
IARC monograph. It has been the subject of an NTP rodent bioassay (TR-494), which concluded that there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity in male F344/N rats 
(kidney and urinary bladder), clear evidence of carcinogenic activity in female F344/N 
rats (liver, kidney, and urinary bladder), a nd clear evidence of ca rcinogenic activity in 
male and female B6C3F
1 mice (liver). All of the reported sites for anthraquinone-induced 
neoplastic lesions also are ta rget sites for ADBAQ. No information was available on the 
potential carcinogenicity of the two other contaminants. 
4.1 Rats 
The NTP (1996) conducted three studies of ADBAQ in rats: a 13-week study, a two-year 
(104-week) study, and a 15-month stop-exposure study. Male and female F344/N rats 
were administered ADBAQ in their diet at  concentrations ranging from 1,000 to 
50,000 ppm. 
4.1.1 Thirteen-week study 
Groups of F344/N rats (10 of each sex) were fed diets containing ADBAQ at a 
concentration of 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, or  50,000 ppm for 13 weeks. After the 
13-week exposure, necropsies were performe d, in which tissues were collected and 
processed for histologic examination (a comple te list of tissues and organs examined is 
included in Appendix B). Survival to st udy termination and mean final body weight 
(b.w.) as a percent of m ean control body weight ar e shown in Table 4-1. The 
nonneoplastic lesions of the liver included ba sophilic foci, clear-c ell foci, eosinophilic 
foci, cytomegaly, bile duct hyperplasia, in flammation, fibrosis, necrotizing cholangitis, 
vacuolar degeneration, and pigmentation. The incidence of hepato cellular cytomegaly

(hypertrophy) was significantly increased ( P < 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) in both male and 
female rats at 25,000 and 50,000 ppm and in fema le rats at 10,000 ppm. The incidences 
of inflammation around bile ducts and bile duct hyperplasia also were significantly 
increased ( P < 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) in male and female rats in the 25,000- and 
50,000-ppm groups. The kidney lesions includ ed renal tubule pigmentation (in both 
males and females in all exposure groups) and hyaline droplet accumulation (in males 
only in the 2,500-, 5,000-, and 10,000-ppm grou ps). Data for other exposure-related 
lesions in all groups are su mmarized in the NTP report (Appendix A, p. A-26, Table 4).

Fleischman et al. (1986) reported results from the NTP’s 13-week toxicology studies of 
ADBAQ in Fischer 344/N rats. Both male and female rats in the 25,000- and 50,000-ppm 
groups were emaciated and lethargic, and their body weights were significantly lower 
(P < 0.01, Williams’s or Dunnett’s test) than thos e of controls. Pathological findings of 
nonneoplastic lesions of the liver and kidney we re the same as those reported in NTP 
(1996). The uterus was atrophied in fema les fed ADBAQ at a concentration of 10,000 
ppm or higher, and the thymus was atroph ied in males at 5,000 ppm or higher and in 
females at 25,000 ppm or higher. A consistent  finding in both sexes was anemia, with a 
significant reduction ( P < 0.01, Student’s t test) in the number of red blood cells at all 
concentrations tested. The au thors concluded that ADBAQ was “markedly toxic in rats.”  
4.1.2 Two-year study 
Dietary concentrations of ADBAQ for the two-year study in rats were based on the 
results of the 13-week study. Exposure-related lesions of the liver, kidney, and spleen 
were present mainly in the 25,000- and 50,000-ppm groups in the 13-week studies. 
Exposure levels of 0, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm we re selected for the two-year study. 
Although the 10,000-ppm exposure level could be  considered slightly high, based on 
body-weight effects (Table 4-1), this dietary concentration wa s predicted not to adversely 
affect the health or survival of the animals because it did not cause liver toxicity in the

study. 
Male and female F344/N rats were obtaine d at approximately six weeks of age and 
quarantined for 12 to 14 days (males) or 9 da ys (females) before the study began. Groups 
of rats (70 of each sex) received ADBAQ in the diet at a concentration of 0, 5,000, or 
10,000 ppm, and 50 rats of each sex received ADBAQ at 2,000 ppm. A subset from each 
exposure level (10 of each sex) was designate d for an interim evaluation after 9 months. 
Additional subsets from the control a nd 10,000-ppm groups (10 of each sex) were 
evaluated after 15 months. Major tissues were  collected for histol ogical examination. The 
exposure protocol is su mmarized in Figure 4-1.

Survival to study termination, final mean body weight as a percentage of mean control 
body weight, and neoplastic lesi on incidence at two years are summarized in Table 4-2. 
Neoplastic lesions were observed in the liver, large intestine,  kidney, urinary bladder, and 
forestomach. Neoplasms of the liver include d both single and multiple adenomas and 
single and multiple carcinomas. The large intestine contained single and multiple 
adenomatous polyps and single and multiple carcinomas. Renal lesions included renal 
tubule adenoma and carcinoma, and urinary bladder lesions included transitional-cell papilloma and carcinoma. Lesions of the fo restomach included squamous-cell papilloma 
and carcinoma, but the increased incidences  did not reach statis tical significance. 
Significant increases were seen  at all exposure levels for tumors of the liver, large 
intestine, and kidney. The inci dence of urinary bladder tumors also was significantly 
increased in high-dose males and mid- and high-dose females.

Hepatocellular, large intestine, kidney, and bladder tumors also were found in rats that 
received ADBAQ at 10,000 ppm fo r 15 months (interim sacrif ice). The incidences of 
hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma in 10/10 male and 9/10 female rats were significantly greater ( P < 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) than in  controls. A similar incidence of 
liver tumors was seen in the 15-mont h stop-exposure study (discussed below). 
4.1.3 Fifteen-month stop-exposure study 
The NTP conducted a stop-exposure study to ev aluate the potential for progression or 
regression of ADBAQ-induced lesions. Male and female F344/N rats were obtained at 
approximately six weeks of age and quarantined for 12 to 14 days (males) or 9 days (females) before the study began. Groups of rats (10 of each sex) were fed a diet 
containing ADBAQ at a concentr ation of 20,000 ppm and were s acrificed after 9 months 
(9-month exposure group). Additional groups (10 of each sex) were fed a diet containing 
ADBAQ at 20,000 ppm for 9 months , followed by the control diet for 6 months (9-month 
stop-exposure group). The final group (20 of each sex) received only the diet containing 
ADBAQ at 20,000 ppm for 15 m onths (15-month exposure group). The exposure 
protocol for the stop-exposure studie s is summarized in Figure 4-2.

Survival to study termination, final mean body weight as a percentage of mean control

lesions were found in the liver of male and fe male rats at the 15-month evaluation in both 
the 9-month stop-exposure group and the 15-m onth exposure group. The large intestines 
contained adenomatous polyps of the rectum in exposed males and females; however, the 
tumor incidence was statistica lly significantly increased ( P < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test) 
only in males in the 15-month exposure group and females in the 9-month stop-exposure 
group. The incidences of tumors of the kidney and urinary bladder were not statistically 
significantly increased, but the numerical increas es in these tumors are concordant with 
those observed in the two-year  bioassay (see Table 4-2).

Maronpot et al.  (1989a) analyzed the incidence of hepa tic foci that eith er stained positive 
for γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) or were identified as altered hepatocellular foci 
(AHF) in hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections of livers from female F344/N rats fed 
ADBAQ at a concentration of 10,000 or 20,000 pp m for 15 months (in the NTP two-year 
and stop-exposure studies). The number of foci per cubic centimeter and the focus 
volume fraction (percent of liver volume occupi ed by foci) were significantly increased 
in both the low- and high-dose groups, a nd the mean focus volume was significantly 
increased in the high-dose group (Table 4- 4). The authors concluded, however, that 
increases in AHF in the two-year carcinoge nicity study were insufficient evidence of 
hepatocarcinogenicity in the abse nce of a liver tumor response.

Harada et al.  (1989) performed qualitative and qu antitative assessm ent of altered 
hepatocellular foci in histological material  from the NTP two-year and 15-month stop-
exposure studies of ADBAQ in rats. Liver sa mples collected at 9-, 15-, and 24-month 
intervals were included in the analysis. The authors separated both basophilic and 
eosinophilic AHF into common and atypical ty pes. No exposure-related changes in 
number, size, or volume fraction were f ound for commonly occurring AHF. However, 
these parameters were significantly increased for atypical AHF and were correlated with 
the level and duration of exposure to ADBAQ in  both male and female rats. The numbers 
of AHF in the two higher-dose groups (10,000 and 20,000 ppm) tended to decrease over time, and this trend correlated with the occurr ence of liver tumors in the animals selected 
for AHF analysis. 
4.2 Mice 
The NTP (1996) conducted two studies of  ADBAQ in male and female B6C3F
1 mice: a 
13-week study and a two-year (104-week) study. 
4.2.1 Thirteen-week study 
Groups of B6C3F 1 mice (10 of each sex) were fed diets containing ADBAQ at a 
concentration of 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, or  50,000 ppm for 13 weeks. After the 
13-week exposure, necropsies were performe d, in which tissues of all animals were 
collected, weighed, and processed for histologi c examination (a complete list of tissues

mean body weight as percent of control mean  body weight are summarized in Table 4-5. 
Nonneoplastic lesions of the liver were obs erved, including pigmentation in males (5/10 
at 2,500 ppm and 8/10 to 10/10 at 10,000 ppm or higher) and females (1/10 at 25,000 and 
50,000 ppm) and centrilobular hypertrophy in ma les only (8/10 to 10/10 at 10,000 ppm or 
higher). Data for exposure-related nonneoplastic  lesions in all groups  are summarized in 
the NTP report (Appendix A, p. A-57, Table 20).

Fleischman et al. (1986) also reported the results from the NTP’s 13-week study of 
ADBAQ in B6C3F 1 mice. The effects of exposure to ADBAQ for 13 weeks were less 
pronounced in mice than in rats. Body weight was not affected in either sex at any 
exposure level (Table 4-5). Dose-related lesions  of the liver were observed in male mice 
and included centrilobular gl ycogen depletion at 10,000 ppm or higher and pigmentation 
at all exposure levels. The authors concl uded that “at comparable doses, ADBAQ was 
considered to be markedly toxic in rats a nd of minimal, non-life-th reatening toxicity in 
mice.” 
4.2.2 Two-year study 
Dietary concentrations of ADBAQ for the two-year study in mi ce were based on the 
results of the 13-week study, specifically, on th e frequency and severi ty of centrilobular 
hypertrophy of the liver observed in male mi ce. Because only lesions of mild severity 
were observed in groups exposed to ADB AQ at 10,000 or 25,000 ppm, and lesions of 
moderate severity were observed in th e 50,000-ppm group, exposure concentrations for 
the two-year study were set at 0, 10,000, and 20,000 ppm. Other consid erations included 
consistency among males and females (as female s could have been given higher exposure 
concentrations) and correspondence to the conc entrations selected for the stop-exposure 
study in rats (see Appendix A, p. A-57). 
Male and female B6C3F 1 mice were obtained at five week s of age and quarantined for 15 
days before the study began. Groups of mice ( 60 of each sex) received diets containing

ADBAQ at a concentration of 0, 10,000, or 20,000 ppm. A subset of 10 mice from each 
group was sacrificed at 15 months, and the remaining 50 mice were sacrificed at 24 months. The exposure protocol  is shown in Figure 4-3.

The results of the two-year study are summa rized in Table 4-6. Feed consumption by 
exposed mice was generally similar to that of controls; however, final mean body weight was lower for exposed mice than for controls. Survival of exposed male mice was significantly lower than that of  controls, but survival of exposed females was similar to 
that of controls. Hepatoce llular adenoma or carcinoma, forestomach squamous-cell 
papilloma, and alveolar/bronc hiolar adenoma were observed in exposed mice but not in 
controls at the 15-month interim sacrifice.  Incidences of hepa tocellular adenoma or 
carcinoma in high-dose males and females, s quamous-cell papilloma in high-dose males 
and low-dose females, and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma in high-dose and low-dose males were significantly higher than in controls. At the end of the two-year study, significant increases were observed in the incidences of heptatocellular multiple 
adenomas and multiple carcinomas in both male  and female mice at both exposure levels. 
In addition, squamous-cell papilloma a nd carcinoma of the forestomach were 
significantly increased in both males and fema les at both exposure levels. The incidence 
of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carci noma of the lung also was significantly 
increased in both males and females.

4.3 Summary 
ADBAQ was toxic to male and female F344/N ra ts at dietary concentrations of 2,500 to 
50,000 ppm consumed over a 13-week period, as evidenced by decreased body weight, 
nonneoplastic lesions in the liver and kidney, a nd anemia. Exposure of male and female 
B6C3F 1 mice to ADBAQ at the same dietary concentrations resulted in lower apparent 
toxicity, as mice gained we ight at all ADBAQ exposure levels, and fewer types of 
nonneoplastic lesions of the liv er and kidney were observed. 
In two-year dietary studie s with ADBAQ, male and female F344/N rats exhibited 
significantly increased incidences of neoplasms  of the liver, large intestine, kidney, and 
urinary bladder. Significant increases in the incidences of tumors of the liver and large 
intestinge (females only) also were obser ved in a 15-month stop- exposure study in rats. 
B6C3F 1 mice consuming ADBAQ-containing di ets for two years had increased 
incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma, squamous-cell papilloma and 
carcinoma of the forestomach, and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma and carcinoma of the lung. The NTP report concluded that “under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, 
there was clear evidence for carcinogenic activity of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
in male and female F344/N rats based on incr eased incidences of neoplasms in the liver, 
large intestine, kidney, and urinary bladder. There was clear evidence for carcinogenic 
activity of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in male and female B6C3F
1 mice based on 
increased incidences of neoplasms in the liver, forestomach, and lung.”

5 Genotoxicity 
Limited data are available on the genotoxic ity of ADBAQ. The few studies that have 
attempted to ascertain the mutagenicity of ADBAQ have enc ountered solubility problems 
that make the assays difficult to execute and that complicate interpretation of the results. 
5.1 Prokaryotic systems: Salmonella typhimurium 
Salmonella typhimurium  is the only prokaryote in whic h the mutagenicity of ADBAQ has 
been assessed. Several strains, including those that revert by base pair substitutions 
(TA100 and TA1535) and those that revert by frameshift mutati ons (TA98, TA1537, and 
TA1538), were used in the ADBAQ mutagenicity tests. 
Haworth et al . (1983) showed that without rat or  hamster liver microsomal (S9) 
metabolic activation, ADBAQ induced reverse mutation in strains TA98 and TA1537 
(Table 5-1). In the presence of S9, reverse mutation was not induced in strain TA98, and 
strain TA1537 gave a variable response. ADB AQ was weakly mutagenic in strain TA100 
(with or without S9 activation) and nonmutagenic in strain TA1535. The ADBAQ 
preparation used in these studi es had a labeled purity of 91.7% and an analyzed purity of 
79.7%. The researchers reported the presence of precipitate when ADBAQ 
concentrations were in the range of 333 to 10,000 μg/plate (the highest concentration 
tested). The NTP (1996) noted that the posit ive or weakly positiv e mutagenic responses 
in the Haworth et al . (1983) study were observed in stra ins in which reversion occurs by 
frameshift mutations.

G1 of NTP (1996). 
a+ = positive (a reproducible dose-related increase) ; – = negative; –/+ = equivocal (positive or weakly 
positive responses that were not replicated in a second trial). 
5.2 Mammalian systems 
Rodent cells were used to determine the mutagenicity and DNA-damaging potential of 
ADBAQ. No reports of in vivo  mammalian genotoxicity assays were found in the 
literature. 
5.2.1 Mouse lymphoma L5178YTK+/- cells 
Harrington-Brock et al . (1991) carried out a limited ev aluation of the ability of ADBAQ 
to induce mutations at the thymidine kinase ( tk) locus, but they were unable to test for 
29
  
 
  
 9/19/02 RoC Background Document for 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
micronucleus formation because of ADBAQ’s limited solubility. ADBAQ was not 
mutagenic in the absence or presence of i nduced-rat liver S9 at the highest testable 
concentrations (25 μg/mL without S9 and 20 μ g/mL with S9). The authors reported that 
the sample of ADBAQ was from the same  batch evaluated in the NTP rodent 
carcinogenesis assay, and that the purity of the sample was 79.7%. 
5.2.2 Chromosomal aberrations 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were expos ed to various concen trations of ADBAQ 
and then analyzed for chromosomal aberrations (Loveday  et al.  1990). The authors 
reported the presence of a precipitat e in the flasks c ontaining ADBAQ at 50 μg/mL (the 
highest concentration tested). Two separate trials without S9 metabolic activation gave 
equivocal results (Table 5-2). In one trial, exposure to ADBAQ at 3.02 or 10.10 μg/mL 
significantly increased the per centage of cells with chromo somal aberrations (Dunnett’s 
test, P < 0.05). In the second trial, the percentage of cells wi th chromosomal aberrations 
was not significantly increased by ADBA Q at concentrations of 1.0, 3.0, 10.0, or 30.0 
μg/mL. In the presence of S9, the percentage of cells with chromosomal aberrations was 
not significantly increased by e xposure to ADBAQ at 3.02, 10.10, or 30.20 μg/mL.  
The NTP (1996) reported additional result s obtained in two trials performed by 
Environmental Health Research and Testing, In c. (Research Triangle Park, NC). In the 
absence of S9, the percentage of cells with  chromosomal aberrations was significantly 
increased by exposure to ADBAQ at 50 μg/mL in the first trial, but increases observed at 
16, 30, or 50 μg/mL in the second trial were not sta tistically significant.  In the presence 
of S9, the percentage of cells with chro mosomal aberrations was not significantly 
increased by ADBAQ at 16, 50, or 100 μg/mL. Based on these st udies, the NTP (1996) 
concluded that ADBAQ induced chromosomal aberrations only  in the absence of S9.  
5.2.3 Sister chromatid exchange 
Loveday et al. (1990) examined the effect of ADBAQ on the induction of sister 
chromatid exchange (SCE) in CHO cells. The chemical purity of ADBAQ was reported 
as greater than 79.7%, but the impurities were not identified. A trend test was used to 
describe the strength of evid ence for SCE induction. Results we re designated as negative, 
questionable, weakly positive, or positive, based on the trend test and the number of exposure levels resulting in at least a 20% incr ease over controls. Three exposure levels 
were used for each trial, and at least two ha d to produce a 20% increase for the result to 
be considered positive. In the presence or absence of induced-rat liver S9, ADBAQ induced SCE in a dose-dependent manner. In the absence of S9, ADBAQ induced at least 
a 20% increase in the number of SCEs at a concentration of 10 µg/mL, but not at 5 or 
2.5 µg/mL. In the presence of S9, ADBAQ induced  at least a 20% incr ease in the number 
of SCEs at 3.01, 10.1, or 30.1 μg/mL in trial 1 and at th e highest concentration (15 
μg/mL) in trial 2. The authors classified ADB AQ as weakly positive for SCE induction in 
the absence of S9 and positive (trial 1) or w eakly positive (trial 2) in the presence of S9 
(Table 5-2). 
The NTP (1996) also reported results from the Environmental Health Research and 
Testing Laboratory, which found that ADBAQ te sted at concentrations ranging from 5 to 
30

50 µg/mL induced SCE in the absence of S9  (results were positive in one trial and 
weakly positive in another). In the presence of S9, ADBAQ at 5, 16, 50, or 100 μg/mL 
(one trial) did not induce SCE. The NTP (1996) noted that the discrepancy in SCE 
induction in the presence of S9 could not  be explained by differences between the 
ADBAQ concentrations used by Loveday et al.  (1990) and the NTP (1996).

5.2.4 Ras mutations in tumors 
Hayashi et al.  (2001) examined 8 forestomach squa mous-cell papillomas, 24 squamous­
cell carcinomas, 19 alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, and 4 alveolar/bronchiolar 
carcinomas for mutations in the H-ras and/or K- ras genes. These tumors were obtained 
from male and female B6C3F 1 mice that were fed di ets containing ADBAQ at a 
concentration of 10,000 or 20,000 ppm  for two years (NTP 1996). Ras codons 12, 13, and 
61, which are hot spots for mutations in human  and rodent tumors, were examined in 
tumors from exposed mice, in spontaneous tumors from control mice, and in histologically normal forestomach and l ung tissues. The ADBAQ-induced tumors had a 
higher frequency of ras mutations than did spontaneous tumors, and the mutations were 
found in both benign and malignant tumors (T able 5-3). The mutation spectra for the 
low- and high-dose groups were the same. Mutations in ras were not detected in any of 
the normal tissues. The predominant mutations in ADBAQ-induced tumors were CAA to CTA transversions and CAA to CG A transitions in codon 61 of K- ras (lung tumors) or 
H-ras (forestomach tumors). No A to T transver sions at the second base  were detected in 
spontaneous tumors. Mutations observed in codons 12 or 13 genera lly occurred in both 
ADBAQ-induced and spontaneous tumors. The authors conclude d that alterations in the 
ras gene might be an early event in ADBAQ-induced carcinogenesis.

5.3 Summary 
ADBAQ was mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strains that revert by frameshift mutations, 
and the mutagenicity was decreased or elimin ated in the presence of induced hamster or 
rat liver S9 metabolic activation. ADBAQ did not induce detectable mutations at the tk 
locus in mouse lymphoma cells; however, the concentrations used (20 or 25 μg/mL) were 
less than those used for the S. typhimurium  assays (100 to 10,000 μg/mL) and slightly 
less than those used to asse ss clastogenicity (up to 100 μg/mL of ADBAQ). In CHO 
cells, ADBAQ induced chromosomal aberrations  and SCE without metabolic activation; 
however, the results were inconsistent between different trials and laboratories. 
Forestomach and lung tumors induced  by ADBAQ had a higher frequency of ras 
mutations than did spontaneous tumors. In particular, CAA to CTA transversions were 
common in ADBAQ-induced tumors but were ab sent in spontaneous tumors. The results 
obtained with ADBAQ must be viewed in the light of the limited solubility of this 
molecule and the uncertain purity  of the preparations tested.

6 Other Relevant Data 
6.1 Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
The NTP (1996) reported studies on the ab sorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion of ADBAQ. Male F344/ N rats were administered [14C]ADBAQ orally or 
intravenously (i.v.), and disposition and elim ination of radioactiv ity (parent compound 
and/or metabolites) was monitored for up to  72 hours. The specific location of the 
radioactive carbon atom(s) in the AD BAQ molecule was not identified. 
6.1.1 Absorption 
ADBAQ was readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The percentage of the dose 
absorbed was inversely proportional to dose leve l. When rats were administered single 
oral doses of 2, 23, 118, 814, or 1,473 mg/kg b.w., 90% of the lowest dose (2 mg/kg) was 
absorbed, but only 2% of the 814-mg/kg dose (NTP 1996). 
6.1.2 Distribution and metabolism 
ADBAQ was rapidly and widely distributed after i.v. admini stration. Radioactivity in 
blood was located primarily in plasma, as re flected by a whole blood:plasma ratio of 0.5. 
Fifteen minutes after i.v. administration (0.4 mg/kg b.w.), radioactivity was detected in 
most soft tissues, with the highest concentrations in excretory organs, lung, kidney, small intestine, liver, adipose tissue, and adrenal glands. At 15 minutes, tissue:blood ratios of radioactivity for these tissues were 3.0 or gr eater. Tissue:blood rati os declined during the 
72 hours after administration, remaining greater than 1.0 only in liv er and kidney at 72 
hours. No quantitative data on tissue distribution were reported (NTP 1996). 
Two hours after administration, only 3% of circ ulating radioactivity was in the form of 
unchanged parent compound, indicating that ADBAQ was quickly metabolized. 
Unchanged ADBAQ was deposited in adipose tissue, where it remained largely 
unmetabolized. As late as 24 hours after admi nistration, the radioactivity remaining in 
adipose tissue was still unchanged ADBAQ, wher eas that in liver, muscle, and skin was 
primarily ADBAQ metabolites (which were not identified) (NTP 1996). The metabolites 
of ADBAQ are unknown. Other anthraquinone-based dyes (Section 1, Table 1-2) were examined by IARC (1982) and the NTP (1978a, 1978b, 1978c, 1986), but their metabolites also are unknown. The NTP (1996) study did find that very little (less than 3%) of [
14C]ADBAQ was excreted as unmetabolized ADBAQ.  
6.1.3 Excretion 
In the three days afte r administration of [14C]ADBAQ, approximately 50% of ADBAQ-
associated radioactivity was recovered from feces, 15% from urine, and 6% from expired 
air. Consistent with extensive metabolism, le ss than 3% of total radioactivity excreted 
represented unchanged ADBAQ. Terminal half-l ives of administered radioactivity in 
liver and kidney were estimated to be 40 and 90 hours, respectively, and the elimination 
half-life from adipose tissue was 11 hours.

6.2 Liver focus model 
Maronpot et al.  (1989b) tested ADBAQ in a neonata l rat liver focus model for its 
potential both as an initiator  and as a promoter. In the te st for initiation potential, 
0.07 mg/g b.w. of ADBAQ was injected intrap eritoneally (i.p.) within 24 hours after 
birth, and phenobarbital (500 pp m) was used as the promo ting agent over the succeeding 
75 or 300 days. The authors found no evidence of initiating activity for ADBAQ.  
In the test for promotion potential, each neonatal rat was injected with a 
“subcarcinogenic” dose (4 μg/g b.w.) of the initiator, di ethylnitrosamine (DEN), within 
24 hours of birth. After weaning, rats r eceived ADBAQ at either 5,000 ppm or 10,000 
ppm in the diet for either 75 or 300 days pr ior to sacrifice. Livers were examined 
microscopically and graded with respect to number of atypical hepatocellular foci, mean 
focus volume, and tumor incidence. The qualitative results are summarized in Table 6-1. Equivocal results were reported for number of foci and the mean focus volume. The 
authors concluded that the lack of a clear a ssociation between the e quivocal stereological 
response and positive hepatocarcinogenicity in  the two-year study (see Table 4-2) may 
have resulted from unpalatability of the feed containing ADBAQ. The neonatal rats 
initiated with DEN may not have consumed a sufficient dose of ADBAQ to produce an unequivocal AHF response.

6.3 Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of  other quinones and anthraquinones 
ADBAQ and other anthraquinones belong to a ge neral class of quinone  molecules that 
can be derived from aromatic molecules such  as benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene. 
Quinone molecules can be reduced to a rela tively stable hydroquinone, which usually is 
not associated with oxidative stress, or they  may be reduced in a one-electron reduction 
to semiquinone free radicals that give rise to superoxide anions , hydrogen peroxide, and 
other reactive oxygen species  (Parkinson 1996). Bolton et al.  (2000) recently reviewed 
the role of quinones in toxicology, including carcinogenesis. Quinones may be produced 
from benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocar bons, estrogens, and catecholamines and give 
rise to reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA and ot her cellular macromolecules 
and activate signaling pathways. These molecu lar events may be associated with the 
initiation, promotion, and progres sion of carcinogenesis.  
The benzoquinone metabolite of benzene has been proposed as a proximate carcinogenic 
product (Golding and Watson 1999); however, the IARC (1999) overall evaluation was 
that 1,4-benzoquinone is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3). In 
a review of the role of quinoids  in estrogen carcinogenesis, Bolton et al.  (1998) suggested 
that the catechol metabolites of estrogens th at are implicated in the carcinogenic effects 
of these steroids could be metabolized to electrophilic and redox-active quinoids that 
could damage DNA. Their conclusion, howev er, was that the ultimate carcinogenic 
metabolites of estrogens have not been unequivocally established. 
Anthraquinones comprise a la rge class of diverse molecules which may be naturally 
occurring or synthetic in origin. Sendel bach (1989) reviewed the toxicity and 
carcinogenicity of anthraquinone derivatives w ith phenolic, amino, or nitro substitutions 
to the anthraquinone ring structure. The au thor’s general conclusion concerning amino 
substitutions was that addition of an amino group at either the 1- or 2-position of the 
anthraquinone ring appeared to consistently produce renal lesions in  rats. The relevance 
of this conclusion to ADBAQ, which has bot h amino and halogen substitutions to the 
anthraquinone ring, is not clear. However,  anthraquinone also produces renal tumors. 
Renal tubule adenomas and carcinomas (com bined) were significantly increased 
(P < 0.05) by dietary exposure to ADBAQ at 5,000 ppm in female rats and at 10,000 ppm 
in both male and female rats (see Table 4-2). A number of anthraquinone-derived vat dye s have been reviewed by both IARC and the 
NTP. ADBAQ produces tumors at some of the same sites as other anthraquinones. 
Table 6-2 summarizes the IARC and NTP evaluations of several anthraquinone 
derivatives. Information on a number of other anthraquinone derivatives at various stages 
of testing by the NTP can be accessed through the NTP Web site (http://ntp-
server.niehs.nih.gov/main_pages/NTP_ALL_STDY_PG.html). As described in Sect ion 5.2.1, Harrington-Brock et al. (1991) carried out a limited 
evaluation of the ability of ADBAQ to i nduce mutations at the thymidine kinase ( tk) 
locus of L5178/TK
+/-mouse lymphoma cells, but they were unable to test for 
micronucleus formation because of ADB AQ’s limited solubility. An additional 15 
anthraquinones were tested in the same assays. Testing of 8 of these substances was 
incomplete because of their limited sol ubility. For these 15 compounds, Table 6-3 
35
  
 
 9/19/02 RoC Background Document for 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone 
summarizes the results of tests of mutagenicity at the L5178/TK+/- locus in two or three 
experiments and micronucleus analysis from  one experiment per compound. Table 6-3 
also summarizes the mutagenicity of these compounds in S. typhimurium, as reviewed by 
Harrington-Brock et al.  (1991). 
Brown (1980) reviewed the gene tic effects of approximately 80 phenolic anthraquinones 
and reported that a high percentage of these hydroxyanthraquinones (36, or 45%) were 
mutagenic in S. typhimurium  strains TA1537, TA1538, and TA98, which are sensitive to 
mutagens that cause frameshifts. A sma ll portion (~10%) of the hydroxyanthraquinones 
contained either amino or halogen (chlorine or bromine) substitutions; however, the 
relevance of these findings to the possibl e mutagenicity of ADBAQ is not clear.

6.4 Summary 
In rats, ADBAQ is rapidly absorbed from the ga strointestinal tract a nd distributed rapidly 
and widely to most soft tissues. Approxi mately 97% of ADBAQ is metabolized, as 
demonstrated by the small amount (less than 3% ) of radiolabel recovered as the parent 
compound from either blood or urine; howev er, the metabolites of ADBAQ have not 
been identified. ADBAQ and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the feces and urine. 
ADBAQ and other anthraquinones ar e classified with a large number of other quinone 
molecules that can be derived from aromatic  molecules such as benzene, naphthalene, 
and anthracene. Reactive oxygen species generated by metabolism of a variety of 
quinones may be associated with DNA damage  or activation of signaling pathways 
involved in initiation, promotion, and progr ession of carcinogenesis. Four other 
anthraquinone vat dyes evalua ted by the NTP have been listed in the RoC as reasonably 
anticipated to be human carcinogens.  In addition, a high percentage (36/80) of phenolic 
anthraquinones have been reported to be mutagenic in Salmonella .

Tissues examined for histopathology in mice and rats in the NTP bioassays of 
ADBAQ 
13-Week studies 2-Year studies Stop-exposure evaluation 
Complete histopathologic examinations were performed on all animals that died during the study, 
control animals, and 50,000 ppm 
animals. In addition to tissue masses, gross lesions, and associated lymph 
nodes, the tissues examined 
included: adrenal gland, bone and 
marrow, brain, clitoral gland, 
epididymis, esophagus, heart, kidney, large intestine (cecum, 
colon, rectum), liver, lung, lymph 
nodes (mandibular and mesenteric), mammary gland, nose, ovary, 
pancreas, parathyroid gland, 
pituitary gland, preputial gland, prostate gland, salivary gland, 
seminal vesicle, skin, small intestine 
(duodenum, jejunum, ileum), spleen, stomach, testis, thymus, thyroid 
gland, trachea, urinary bladder, and 
uterus. The kidney, liver, spleen (rats), thymus (rats), and uterus 
(rats) of all other exposed animals 
were examined. Complete histopathologic examinations were performed on all animals. In addition to tissue masses, 
gross lesions, and associated lymph 
nodes, the tissues examined included: adrenal gland, bone and 
marrow, brain, clitoral gland, 
epididymis, esophagus, gallbladder 
(mice), heart, kidney, large intestine 
(cecum, colon, rect um), liver, lung, 
lymph nodes (mandibular and 
mesenteric), mammary gland, nose, 
ovary, pancreas, parathyroid gland, pituitary gland, preputial gland, 
prostate gland, salivary gland, 
seminal vesicle, skin, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), spleen, 
stomach, testis, thymus, thyroid 
gland, trachea, urinary bladder, and uterus. Complete histopathologic examinations were performed on all animals. In addition to tissue masses,
