1.  Introduction
Refractory  status  epilepticus  (RSE),  deﬁned  as  the  failure  of
seizure  response  to  a  ﬁrst  line  benzodiazepine  and  second
line  anti-epileptic  drug  (AED),  poses  a  therapeutic  challenge
[1].  Numerous  different  therapies  have  been  utilized  in  attemptsto  control  RSE,  including  various  AEDs  with  different  receptor
targets  [1,2] ,  therapeutic  hypothermia  [3],  volatile  inhalational
anesthetic  agents  [4,5] ,  urgent  vagal  nerve  stimulator  (VNS)
insertion  [6,7] ,  and  even  electroconvulsive  therapy  [8].
Common  AED  targets  include  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA),
GABA  transaminase,  sodium  channels,  calcium  channels  and  n-
methyl  D-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptors  [1,2] .  Both  sodium  channel
and  GABA  mediated  AED  are  the  most  commonly  utilized  medica-
tions  for  seizures,  and  form  the  backbone  of  initial  therapy  for
RSE  [1,2,9] .  Phenytoin,  diphenytoin  and  carbamazapine  are  the
common  sodium  channel  antagonists  utilized  in  the  management
of  seizures  [9].
Lidocaine,  a  class  Ib  anti-arrhythmic  agent  and  local  anesthetic
agent,  has  emerged  within  the  pediatric  literature  as  an  AED  in
neonatal  status  epilepticus  (SE)  [10,11] .  Of  interest,  despite  also
acting  as  a  sodium  channel  antagonist,  lidocaine  has  displayed
efﬁcacy  in  seizure  control  in  cases  of  SE  and  RSE  in  the  presence
of  phenytoin  [12].Seizure  31  (2015)  41–48

Introduction:  Our  goal  was  to  perform  a  systematic  review  of  the  literature  on  the  use  of  intravenous
lidocaine  in  adults  for  status  epilepticus  (SE)  and  refractory  status  epilepticus  (RSE)  to  determine  its
impact  on  seizure  control.
Methods:  All  articles  from  MEDLINE,  BIOSIS,  EMBASE,  Global  Health,  HealthStar,  Scopus,  Cochrane
Library,  the  International  Clinical  Trials  Registry  Platform  (inception  to  November  2014),  and  gray
literature  were  searched.  The  strength  of  evidence  was  adjudicated  using  both  the  Oxford  and  GRADE
methodology  by  two  independent  reviewers.
Results:  Overall,  13  studies  were  identiﬁed,  with  11  manuscripts  and  2  meeting  abstracts.  Seventy-six
adult  patients  were  treated  for  82  episodes  of  SE/RSE.  Patients  had  varying  numbers  of  anti-epileptic
drugs  (AEDs),  1–12,  on  board  prior  to  lidocaine  therapy.  During  69  of  the  82  (84.1%)  episodes  of  SE/RSE,
phenytoin  was  on  board.  The  dose  regimen  of  lidocaine  varied,  with  some  utilizing  bolus  dosing  alone;
others  utilizing  a  combination  of  bolus  and  infusion  therapy.
Overall,  70.7%  of  seizures  responded  to  lidocaine,  with  complete  cessation  and  greater  than  50%
reduction  seen  in  64.1%  and  6.1%  respectively.  Patient  outcomes  were  sparingly  reported.
Conclusions:  There  currently  exists  level  4,  GRADE  C  evidence  to  support  the  consideration  of  lidocaine
for  SE  and  RSE  in  the  adult  population.  Thus  there  is  currently  weak  evidence  to  support  the  use  of
lidocaine  in  this  context.  Further  prospective  studies  of  lidocaine  administration  in  this  setting  are
warranted.

provided by Elsevier - Publisher Connector The  reason  for  the  added  effect  of  lidocaine  in  the  setting  of
previous  sodium  channel  antagonist  administration  likely  stems
from  the  drug’s  amine  chain,  not  present  in  other  commonly  used
sodium  channel  based  AEDs  [13].  This  allows  binding  of  both
compounds  with  aromatic  based  motifs,  like  phenytoin  and
tricyclic  anti-depressants,  and  those  with  amine  chain  motifs,
like  lidocaine,  at  different  sites  on  the  sodium  channels  leading  to
a  combined  effect  [13].
The  majority  of  the  literature  to  date  on  the  use  of  lidocaine  in
SE  and  RSE  is  based  in  the  pediatric  population,  with  stronger
evidence  in  the  neonate  population  for  its  efﬁcacy.  This  difference
may  reﬂect  different  stages  of  brain  maturation  and  thus
responsiveness  to  therapy.  Given  this,  we  were  curious  as  to  the
literature  on  adult  subjects  [14–26] .  The  goal  of  our  study  was  to
perform  a  systematic  review  of  the  literature  to  determine  the
effect  of  lidocaine  on  adult  SE  and  RSE.
2.  Methods
A  systematic  review  using  the  methodology  outlined  in  the
Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviewers  [27]  was  conducted.
The  data  was  reported  following  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for
Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA)  [28].  The  review
questions  and  search  strategy  were  decided  upon  by  the  primary
author  (FZ)  and  supervisor  (MW).
2.1.  Search  question,  population,  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria
The  question  posed  for  systematic  review  was:  What  is  the
effectiveness  of  lidocaine  for  control  of  SE  in  human  adults?  The
inclusion  age  range  was  age  18  or  older.  A  small  number  of  patients
with  age  less  than  18  were  included,  due  to  the  inability  to  separate
their  data  from  the  adults  in  the  parent  manuscripts.  All  studies,
prospective  and  retrospective  of  any  size  based  on  human  subjects
were  included.  The  reason  for  an  all-inclusive  search  was  based  on
the  small  number  of  studies  of  any  type  identiﬁed  by  the  primary
author  during  a  preliminary  search  of  MEDLINE.
The  primary  outcome  measure  was  electrographic  seizure
control.  Secondary  outcome  measures  were  patient  outcome  (if
reported),  and  adverse  effects  of  lidocaine  treatment.
Inclusion  criteria  were:  All  studies  including  human  subjects
whether  prospective  or  retrospective,  all  study  sizes,  adult  patients
(age  18  or  greater),  and  the  use  of  lidocaine  for  seizure  control  in
SE.  Exclusion  criteria  were:  pediatric,  non-English  and  animal
studies.
2.2.  Search  strategy
MEDLINE,  BIOSIS,  EMBASE,  Global  Health,  SCOPUS,  and
Cochrane  Library  from  1946  (inception)  to  November  2014  were
searched  using  individualized  search  strategies  for  each  database.
The  search  strategy  for  MEDLINE  can  be  seen  in  Appendix  A  of  the
supplementary  material,  with  a  similar  search  strategy  utilized
for  the  other  databases.  In  addition,  the  World  Health  Organiza-
tions  International  Clinical  Trials  Registry  Platform  was  searched
looking  for  studies  planned  or  underway.
As  well,  meeting  proceedings  for  the  last  10  years,  looking  for
ongoing  and  unpublished  work  based  on  lidocaine  use  for  seizures,
were  examined.  The  meeting  proceedings  of  the  following
professional  societies  were  searched:  Canadian  Neurological
Sciences  Federation  (CNSF),  American  Association  of  Neurological
Surgeons  (AANS),  Congress  of  Neurological  Surgeons  (CNS),
European  Neurosurgical  Society  (ENSS),  World  Federation  of
Neurological  Surgeons  (WFNS),  American  Neurology  Association
(ANA),  American  Academy  of  Neurology  (AAN),  American  Epilepsy
Society  (AES),  European  Federation  of  Neurological  Science  (EFNS),World  Congress  of  Neurology  (WCN),  Society  of  Critical  Care
Medicine  (SCCM),  Neurocritical  Care  Society  (NCS),  and  the  World
Federation  of  Societies  of  Intensive  and  Critical  Care  Medicine
(WFSICCM),  American  Society  for  Anesthesiologists  (ASA),  World
Federation  of  Societies  of  Anesthesiologist  (WFSA),  Australian
Society  of  Anesthesiologists,  International  Anesthesia  Research
Society  (IARS),  Society  of  Neurosurgical  Anesthesiology  and  Critical
Care  (SNACC),  Society  for  Neuroscience  in  Anesthesiology  and
Critical  Care,  and  the  Japanese  Society  of  Neuroanesthesia  and
Critical  Care  (JSNCC).
Finally,  reference  lists  of  any  review  articles  or  systematic
reviews  on  seizure  management  were  reviewed  for  relevant
studies  on  lidocaine  usage  for  seizure  control.
2.3.  Study  selection
Utilizing  two  reviewers  (FZ  and  KZ),  a  two-step  review  of  all
articles  returned  by  our  search  strategies  was  performed.  First,  the
reviewers  independently  screened  all  titles  and  abstracts  of  the
returned  articles  to  decide  if  they  met  the  inclusion  criteria.
Second,  full  text  of  the  chosen  articles  was  then  assessed  to  conﬁrm
if  they  met  the  inclusion  criteria  and  that  the  primary  outcome  of
seizure  control  was  reported  in  the  study.  Any  discrepancies
between  the  two  reviewers  were  resolved  by  a  third  independent
reviewer  (MW).
2.4.  Data  collection
Data  was  extracted  from  the  selected  articles  and  stored  in  an
electronic  database.  Data  ﬁelds  included:  patient  demographics,
type  of  study  (prospective  or  retrospective),  number  of  patients,
dose  and  route  of  lidocaine  used,  timing  to  administration  of  drug,
duration  of  drug  administration,  time  to  effect  of  drug,  how  many
other  AEDs  were  utilized  prior  to  lidocaine,  degree  of  seizure
control,  adverse  effects,  and  patient  outcome.
2.5.  Quality  of  evidence  assessment
Assessment  of  the  level  of  evidence  for  each  included  study  was
conducted  by  two  independent  reviewers  (FZ  and  MW),  utilizing
the  Oxford  criteria  [29]  and  the  Grading  of  Recommendation
Assessment  Development  and  Education  (GRADE)  criteria  [30–35]
for  level  of  evidence.
The  Oxford  criteria  consist  of  a  5  level  grading  system  for
literature.  Level  1  is  split  into  subcategories  1a,  1b,  and  1c  which
represent  a  systematic  review  of  randomized  control  trials  (RCT)
with  homogeneity,  individual  RCT  with  narrow  conﬁdence
interval,  and  all  or  none  studies  respectively.  Oxford  level  2  is
split  into  2a,  2b,  and  2c  representing  systematic  review  of  cohort
studies  with  homogeneity  of  data,  individual  cohort  study  or  low
quality  RCT,  and  outcomes  research  respectively.  Oxford  level  3  is
split  into  3a  and  3b  representing  systematic  review  of  case-control
studies  with  homogeneity  of  data  and  individual  case-control
study  respectively.  Oxford  level  4  represents  case-series  and  poor
cohort  studies.  Finally,  Oxford  level  5  represents  expert  opinion.
The  GRADE  level  of  evidence  is  split  into  4  levels:  A,  B,  C  and  D.
GRADE  level  A  represents  high  evidence  with  multiple  high  quality
studies  having  consistent  results.  GRADE  level  B  represents
moderate  evidence  with  one  high  quality  study,  or  multiple  low
quality  studies.  GRADE  level  C  evidence  represents  low  evidence
with  one  or  more  studies  with  severe  limitations.  Finally,  GRADE
level  D  represents  very  low  evidence  based  on  either  expert
opinion  or  few  studies  with  severe  limitations.
Any  discrepancies  between  the  grading  of  the  two  reviewers
were  resolved  via  discussion  and  a  third  reviewer  when  required
(CK).F.A.  Zeiler  et  al.  /  Seizure  31  (2015)  41–48 422.6.  Statistical  analysis
A  meta-analysis  was  not  performed  in  this  study  due  to  the
heterogeneity  of  data  within  the  articles  and  the  presence  of  a
small  number  of  predominantly  retrospective  studies.
3.  Results
The  results  of  the  search  strategy  across  all  databases  and  other
sources  are  summarized  in  Fig.  1.  Seven  hundred  twenty-seven
articles  were  identiﬁed,  with  718  from  the  database  search  and
9  from  the  search  of  published  meeting  proceedings.  Seventy-two
duplicate  references  were  removed,  leaving  655  for  analysis.  By
applying  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  to  the  title  and  abstract  of
the  articles,  we  identiﬁed  65  articles  that  ﬁt  these  criteria.  Upon
review  of  the  reference  sections  of  relevant  review  articles,
5  additional  articles  were  added,  leaving  a  total  of  70  articles  for
second  review.  Of  the  70  identiﬁed,  61  were  from  the  database
search  and  9  were  from  published  meeting  proceedings.  Applying
the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  to  the  full  text  documents,  only
13  articles  were  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the  systematic  review,
with  11  from  database  and  2  from  meeting  proceeding  sources.
The  57  articles  that  were  excluded  were  done  so  because  they
either  did  not  report  details  around  the  administration  of  lidocaine
for  seizure  control,  were  based  on  pediatric  patients  only,  were
non-relevant  studies,  or  because  they  were  review  articles.Of  the  13  articles  included  in  the  review,  all  were  original
studies.  There  were  10  retrospective  studies  [14–21,25,26]  and
3  prospective  studies  [22–24] .  Within  the  retrospective  studies,
6  were  retrospective  case  series  [14,15,17–19,25]  and  the
remaining  4  were  retrospective  case  reports  [16,20,21,26] .  All
studies  were  based  at  single  centers.  The  3  prospective  studies
included  in  the  systematic  review  were  all  prospective  single  arm
studies  with  no  control  groups  [22–24] .
Across  all  studies,  76  patients  were  studied  utilizing  lidocaine
for  control  of  their  SE/RSE  (mean:  5.5  patients/study;  range:  1–36
patients/study),  with  a  total  of  82  separate  episodes  of  SE/RSE
treated  with  lidocaine  being  documented.  The  age  of  patients
studied  ranged  from  15  to  89  years.  Two  studies  had  small
numbers  of  pediatric  data  included  with  their  adult  patients,  which
was  inseparable  [18,22] .  This  small  number  of  pediatric  patients
(lowest  recorded  age  of  15)  were  included  as  ‘‘adults’’  for  the
purpose  of  this  study.  One  study  failed  to  indicate  the  age  of  the
participants  [19],  though  it  is  suspected  they  were  adult  base  on
the  pathology  described.  Study  demographics  and  patient  char-
acteristics  for  the  adult  studies  can  be  seen  in  Table  1,  while
treatment  characteristics  and  seizure  outcome  are  reported  in
Table  2.
The  underlying  pathology  leading  to  SE/RSE  within  the  76  cases
identiﬁed  included:  ischemic  stroke  (24),  primary  epilepsy  (12),
traumatic  brain  injury  (TBI)  (5),  tumor  (4),  post-operative  SE  (4),
infectious  (3),  idiopathic  (3),  metabolic  (2),  hypoxia  (2),  intracere-
bral  hemorrhage  (ICH)  (1),  and  unspeciﬁed  (16).

India  [14],  and  Sweden  [15].
3.1.  Lidocaine  treatment  characteristics
Duration  of  treatment  prior  to  lidocaine  administration  was
documented  in  6  studies,  ranging  from  20  min  to  14  days,  with
patients  on  various  numbers  of  AEDs  prior  to  lidocaine,  with  the
mean  number  of  AEDs  ranging  from  1  to  12  with  most  patient
treatments  typically  consisting  of  a  combination  of  oral  AED  and
intravenous  anesthetic  agents.  Of  note,  in  69  of  the  82  (84.1%)  SE/
RSE  episodes  described,  phenytoin  was  on  board  during  lidocaine
administration.  All  AED’s  reported  were  typically  on  board  during
the  lidocaine  treatment.  Similarly,  the  duration  of  lidocaine
treatment  was  described  in  7  of  the  13  studies,  with  treatmentduration  ranging  from  one  time  bolus  dosing,  up  to  84  h
continuous  intravenous  infusion.  No  one  was  discharged  home
on  lidocaine  therapy  for  their  seizures.
The  literature  on  lidocaine  use  for  control  of  SE/RSE  in  the
adult  population  yielded  13  studies.  Within  these  13  studies
[14–26] ,  6  utilized  bolus  dosing  of  lidocaine  in  isolation
[14,15,19,23,24,26] ,  ranging  from  100  to  400  mg  IV,  with  a
common  weight  based  dosing  of  1–3  mg/kg.  One  study  utilized
continuous  infusions  of  lidocaine  only  [19],  with  dosing  ranging
from  2  to  4  mg/kg/h.
Finally,  some  studies  utilized  only  bolus  dosing  of  lidocaine,
followed  by  continuous  infusions  [15,17,19,20,22] .  The  initial
bolus  ranged  from  25  mg  up  to  3  mg/kg  intravenously,  with  the
number  of  boluses  received  prior  to  the  initiation  of  infusion
ranging  from  1  to  4.  The  infusion  rates  ranged  up  to  3  mg/kg/h.

aLemmen et al. [18] and Pascual et al. [22] are studies containing small numbers of pediatric patients, of which the data cannot be extracted from the adult information. Thus these studies were considered to be adult studies, with
the pediatric data included in the analysis.F.A.  Zeiler  et  al.  /  Seizure  31  (2015)  41–48  453.2.  Seizure  response
Overall,  58  of  the  82  (70.7%)  SE/RSE  episodes  studied  displayed
seizure  response  to  lidocaine  administration.  Complete  seizure
control  upon  lidocaine  administration  occurred  in  53  of  the  82
(64.6%)  SE/RSE  episodes  documented.  A  greater  than  50%  reduction
in  seizure  frequency  occurred  in  5  of  the  82  (6.1%)  SE/RSE  episodes
described.  Failure  of  lidocaine  treatment  occurred  in  24  of  82
(29.2%)  episodes.
In  those  patients  with  phenytoin  on  board  during  lidocaine
administration,  there  were  69  discrete  SE/RSE  episodes  recorded.
Lidocaine  administration  resulted  in  seizure  reduction  in  47  of
these  69  (68.1%)  episodes,  with  45  of  69  (65.2%)  and  2  of  69  (2.9%)
resulting  in  complete  seizure  control  and  greater  than  50%  seizure
reduction,  respectively.  Twenty-two  of  these  69  (31.9%)  SE/RSE
episodes  failed  lidocaine  administration  when  phenytoin  was
already  on  board.
Within  the  group  of  patients  treated  with  lidocaine  in  the
absence  of  phenytoin  on  board  there  were  13  discrete  SE/RSE
episodes  described.  Complete  seizure  cessation  with  lidocaine
administration  occurred  in  8  of  the  13  (61.5%)  SE/RSE  episodes.
Three  of  the  13  (23.1%)  SE/RSE  episodes  treated  with  lidocaine
resulted  in  greater  than  50%  reduction  in  seizures.  Failure  of
lidocaine  therapy  occurred  in  2  of  the  13  (15.4%)  of  the  SE/RSE
episodes  described.
Recurrence  of  seizures  upon  withdrawal  of  lidocaine  occurred
in  13  of  the  58  (22.4%)  responsive  SE/RSE  episodes.
3.3.  Adverse  effects  of  lidocaine
Only  two  studies  documented  adverse  events  related  to
lidocaine  administration  [22,23] .  One  study  displayed  2  cases  of
hypotension  with  lidocaine  bolus  dosing  [22].  Cardiorespiratory
arrest  was  seen  in  2  patients  [22,23] .  One  patient  had  received  6  h
of  continuous  lidocaine  infusion  with  control  of  RSE  around  the  6  h
mark  from  onset.  The  patient  arrested  with  failed  resuscitation
attempts  [22].  The  second  patient  suffered  a  fatal  cardiac  arrest  6  h
after  2  bolus  doses  of  lidocaine  were  administered  [23].
3.4.  Outcome
Patient  outcome  was  reported  sparingly  in  most  studies  as  the
main  focus  of  these  reports  was  the  success/failure  of  lidocaine
treatment.  This  data  can  be  seen  in  Table  2.
3.5.  Level  of  evidence  for  lidocaine
Based  on  two  independent  reviewers,  there  were  a  total  of
13  studies  reviewed  with  12  representing  Oxford  level  4  evidence
for  the  administration  of  lidocaine  for  SE/RSE  [14–21,23–26] .
One  prospective  single  arm  study  was  deemed  Oxford  level  2b
evidence  for  the  administration  of  lidocaine  for  SE/RSE.
Eleven  of  13  studies  met  GRADE  D  level  of  evidence  [14–21,
23,25,26] ,  while  the  remaining  2  met  GRADE  C  level  of  evidence
[22,24] .  Summary  of  the  level  of  evidence  can  be  seen  in  Table  3.
4.  Discussion
Lidocaine  is  a  type  Ib  anti-arrhythmic  agent  and  sodium
channel  antagonist  commonly  utilized  in  the  cardiac  and  pain
literature.  It  is  via  its  sodium  channel  blockage  that  neural
conduction  is  reduced  and  impeded,  leading  to  its  anti-arrhythmic
and  anesthetic  properties.  Given  these  effects  at  the  neuronal
sodium  channel,  lidocaine’s  role  as  an  AED  has  been  investigated
[12,14–26] .Unlike  other  sodium  channel  blocking  AEDs,  such  as  phenytoin
(also  a  class  Ib  anti-arrhythmic),  its  structure  includes  an  aromatic
and  amine  chain  motif  allowing  for  binding  to  the  sodium  channel
via  both  the  channels  pore-lining  phenyl  binding  site  [36,37] ,  or  via
the  external  amine  chain  site,  both  of  which  lead  to  the  reduction
of  ion  transport  across  the  cellular  membrane.  Other  sodium
channel  based  AEDs  typically  only  carry  a  diphenyl  motif,  solely
allowing  binding  at  the  pore-lining  phenyl  sites  [13],  blocking
sodium  ion  transport.  Thus,  lidocaine  can  potentially  add  further
sodium  channel  blockade  in  the  setting  of  refractory  seizures
where  other  sodium  channel  antagonists  are  on  board,  via
interaction  with  the  external  amine  binding  site.
To  date  small  case  series  have  appeared  since  the  1950s
describing  the  use  of  lidocaine  as  an  AED,  with  the  majority  of
the  literature  focused  on  the  pediatric  population.  Current
literature  suggests  a  trend  to  improved  responsiveness  in  the
neonate  population,  which  may  suggest  a  differential  response
rate  depending  on  the  degree  of  brain  maturation.  This  however
has  yet  to  be  substantiated.  Given  the  success  of  lidocaine  as
an  AED  in  the  setting  of  neonatal  and  pediatric  seizures  [10–12] ,
we  elected  to  perform  a  systematic  review  of  the  literature  in
order  to  determine  its  effect  on  SE  and  RSE  in  the  adult  population.
Through  our  review  we  identiﬁed  13  articles  pertaining  to  the
reported  usage  of  lidocaine  for  adult  SE/RSE  [14–26] ,  with
11  published  manuscripts  and  2  published  meeting  abstracts.  A
total  of  76  patients  were  described  in  these  articles,  with  82  distinct
episodes  of  SE/RSE  being  treated  with  lidocaine.  The  majority  of  the
studies  were  retrospective  case  reports/series,  with  only  3  being
prospective  single  arm  studies.  Looking  at  the  primary  outcome
of  our  study  (seizure  control),  70.7%  of  these  SE/RSE  episodes
responded  to  lidocaine  administration,  with  64.3%  complete
seizure  control  rates.  Of  interest,  during  69  of  the  SE/RSE  episodes,
phenytoin  was  on  board  during  lidocaine  administration,  with
68.1%  displaying  seizure  response  to  lidocaine.  Recurrence  of
seizures  after  lidocaine  withdrawal  occurred  in  22.4%  of  SE/RSE
episodes.  In  the  secondary  outcomes,  few  adverse  events  were
reported  with  lidocaine  administration,  though  those  reported
were  signiﬁcant.  Patient  outcome  data  was  too  sparingly
documented  for  any  conclusions  to  be  made.  Twelve  studies  wereTable  3

aLemmen  et  al.  [18]  and  Pascual  et  al.  [22]  are  studies  containing  small  numbers
of  pediatric  patients,  of  which  the  data  cannot  be  extracted  from  the  adult
information.  Thus  these  studies  were  considered  to  be  adult  studies,  with  the
pediatric  data  included  in  the  analysis.F.A.  Zeiler  et  al.  /  Seizure  31  (2015)  41–48 46Oxford  level  4  for  quality,  with  one  representing  Oxford  level  2b.
Eleven  studies  were  GRADE  D,  with  2  representing  GRADE  C
level  of  evidence.  A  meta-analysis  was  not  possible  given  the
heterogeneous  nature  of  the  studies  available.  Thus,  based  on  this
review,  we  can  currently  provide  Oxford  level  4,  GRADE  C
recommendations  for  the  use  of  lidocaine  for  adult  SE/RSE.  This
constitutes  weak  evidence  to  support  the  use  of  lidocaine  in  this
context.  The  current  lack  of  more  robust  studies  impairs  our  ability
to  draw  more  deﬁnitive  conclusions  on  the  impact  of  lidocaine
for  SE/RSE  in  adults.
Some  important  points  have  arisen  from  our  review.  First,  the
seizure  response  rate  of  70.7%  with  lidocaine  administration  in  a
population  of  medically  refractory  cases  is  quite  high  compared  to
other  therapies  for  RSE  [38].  This  likely  represents  a  signiﬁcant
publication  bias,  focused  on  publishing  only  positive  results  with
lidocaine  for  SE/RSE.  Second,  the  seizure  cessation  rate  of  65.2%  in
response  to  lidocaine  when  phenytoin  has  already  been  adminis-
tered  highlights  the  effectiveness  of  this  medication  in  the
presence  of  another  sodium  channel  agent,  as  further  emphasized
by  the  61.5%  cessation  rate  for  those  patients  not  on  phenytoin
during  lidocaine  therapy.  This  likely  represents  the  effect  of  the
external  sodium  channel  binding  motif  of  lidocaine,  not  possessed
by  other  sodium  channel  AEDs.  Third,  the  seizure  recurrence  with
withdrawal  of  lidocaine  therapy  was  22.4%,  emphasizing  that  this
treatment  is  not  a  long-term  solution,  but  an  option  during  crisis.
Seizure  response  to  lidocaine  should  be  met  with  ongoing
adjustment  of  oral  AEDs  with  the  goal  of  discontinuing  intravenous
anesthetic  agents.  Fourth,  there  did  not  appear  to  be  a  trend  to
increased  efﬁcacy  in  any  particular  underlying  etiology  treated
within  the  studies.  Fifth,  the  majority  of  the  studies  originated  in
the  USA  or  Western  Europe.  This  is  slightly  different  when
compared  to  those  in  the  neonate  populations  which  have  a
Japanese  predominance.  Thus,  there  may  be  a  potential  for  regional
variation  in  the  application  and  response  of  lidocaine  for  SE/RSE.
Finally,  the  number  of  complications  described  was  low,  with  only
two  patients  developing  hypotension.  The  two  cases  of  cardiore-
spiratory  arrest  during  the  treatment  of  RSE  are  difﬁcult  to  solely
attribute  to  lidocaine  therapy  given  the  complexity  of  treatment
and  critical  illness.  However,  given  that  we  cannot  completely
exclude  lidocaine  as  the  cause  of  arrest  given  the  available  data,  we
include  these  two  cases  as  complications  of  therapy.
Our  review  has  signiﬁcant  limitations.  First,  the  small  number
of  studies  identiﬁed,  all  with  small  patient  populations,  makes  it
difﬁcult  to  generalize  to  all  adult  SE/RSE  patients.  Second,  the
predominantly  retrospective  heterogeneous  nature  of  the  data
makes  it  difﬁcult  to  perform  a  meaningful  meta-analysis,  resulting
in  a  strictly  descriptive  analysis.  Third,  the  heterogeneity  of  prior
treatments,  time  to  lidocaine  administration,  and  lidocaine  dosage
and  duration  leave  the  data  on  seizure  responsiveness  difﬁcult  to
interpret.  It  is  even  more  difﬁcult,  on  the  basis  of  this  data,  to
recommend  a  treatment  regimen  based  on  lidocaine.  Fourth,  the
outcome  data  was  poorly  recorded  in  the  majority  of  the  studies
identiﬁed.  As  such,  formal  comments  on  the  impact  of  lidocaine
therapy  on  patient  outcome  during  SE/RSE  cannot  be  made  at  this
time.  Fifth,  a  small  number  of  pediatric  patients  may  have  been
included  in  the  synthesis  of  data,  and  thus  our  results  may  not
reﬂect  an  entirely  ‘‘adult’’  population.  Two  manuscripts  describe
patients  under  the  age  of  18  [18,22] ,  however  we  were  unable  to
separate  their  data  from  the  adult  population.  Similarly,  one  study
[19]  failed  to  document  the  age  of  the  patients.  Though  we  suspect,
based  on  the  pathology  described,  that  these  patients  were  adults,
they  very  well  may  be  younger  than  18  years  of  age.  Sixth,  the
range  of  ages  seen  in  this  review  is  important.  There  may  be  a
correlation  of  responsiveness  to  lidocaine  and  the  degree  of  brain
maturation.  Thus,  younger  patients  may  be  more  adept  to
responding,  as  seen  in  the  neonates,  whereas  the  elderly  maynot  be  as  responsive.  We  were  unable  to  determine  a  trend  to
responsiveness  in  younger  adult  patients  however.  This  is  an  area
of  potential  future  research.  Seventh,  we  intentionally  excluded
non-English  manuscripts  from  the  review.  Though  we  did  not
identify  any  abstracts  of  non-English  origin  that  may  have  been  of
interest,  we  may  have  missed  some  non-English  manuscripts  in
the  process  which  focused  on  lidocaine  for  SE/RSE  in  adults.  As  a
result,  our  review  may  not  be  entirely  inclusive.  Finally,  as
previously  mentioned,  there  is  likely  a  signiﬁcant  publication  bias
in  the  literature  favoring  the  publication  of  only  positive  results
with  lidocaine  therapy  for  adult  SE/RSE.  Despite  these  signiﬁcant
limitations,  we  believe  the  data  provides  evidence  for  the  potential
beneﬁt  of  lidocaine  therapy  in  the  setting  of  adult  SE/RSE.
Future  prospective  analysis  of  lidocaine  treatment  during  adult
SE/RSE  should  be  conducted.  Formal  comparison  between
phenytoin  and  lidocaine  in  a  randomized  fashion  may  prove
interesting.  Furthermore,  prospective  evaluation  of  lidocaine  as
the  3rd  line  agent  in  adult  SE/RSE,  in  comparison  to  other
commonly  utilized  agents  should  be  conducted.  In  addition,  there
exists  room  for  multicenter  RCT  in  RSE  comparing  lidocaine  to
other  commonly  utilized  agents  such  as  midazolam  or  thiopen-
tone.  Prior  to  embarking  on  such  endeavors  however,  we  need  to
outline  a  means  for  accurate  and  comprehensive  outcome
assessment,  as  this  is  currently  lacking  in  the  available  literature.
5.  Conclusions
There  currently  exists  level  4,  GRADE  C  evidence  to  support  the
consideration  of  lidocaine  for  SE  and  RSE  in  the  adult  population.
This  constitutes  weak  evidence  to  support  the  use  of  lidocaine  in
this  context.  Further  prospective  studies  of  lidocaine  administra-
tion  in  this  setting  are  warranted.
