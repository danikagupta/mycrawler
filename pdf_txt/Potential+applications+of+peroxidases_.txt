This study aimed at evaluating the activity of peroxidases after ultrasound and microwave 
radiation exposure as an alternative to the wastewater treatment improvement. The results showed 
that after treatment with ultrasound using a power of 30% and a temperature of 55 °C was obtained 
an increase in relative activity, 129.5% in the enzyme from rice bran, 147.9% in the enzyme 
from soybean meal and 102.4% in the enzyme from horseradish. Using microwave radiation, 
the highest relative activity (107.4%) was observed for the peroxidase extracted from rice bran 
with 10 seconds of reaction time and a reaction temperature of about 50 °C. The data obtained in 
this study suggest that the ultrasonic bath and microwave are adequate for conducting reactions 
catalyzed by peroxidases because it was possible to increase their activity during the performed 
tests. Preliminary tests of enzyme application showed that the highest color removal occurred using 
3 mL of the enzyme extract from rice bran and H2O2 concentrations of 40 mg L-1. This condition 
resulted in a color removal of about 40%.

Introduction
Enzymes have been used since antiquity in the form 
of animal or plant tissue extracts. Known as biocatalysts, 
they are employed in several industrial processes. Many 
enzymes, of microbial or plant origin, are used in the 
treatment of wastewater and industrial waste.1 Among the 
most studied for degradation purposes, there are oxidative 
enzymes such as the peroxidases.
Peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.X) catalyze the electron 
oxidation of a variety of oxidizable xenobiotics using 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as acceptor molecule.2-4 Its 
activity has been identified in plants, microorganisms and 
animals. Due to their oxidative nature, there are several areas 
where peroxidase could replace chemical oxidants used in 
current techniques.5 The most used chemical oxidants 
for this type of chemical treatment are oxidizers such as 
ozone, permanganate, peroxide, persulfate and others.6 It should be noted that the application of chemical oxidants 
may result in the formation of intermediate compounds 
formed from reactions between the chloride ions present 
in the sample to be treated and organic molecules, and the 
decomposition of these chlorinated by-products can lead to 
the formation of degradation products such as chlorophenol, 
chlorobenzene, chlorobenzoate, or various chlorinated 
products,6,7 which have the carcinogenic potential and 
bioaccumulate in nature.6
Furthermore, these enzymes can be extracted from 
rice bran and soybean meal, which are agroindustrial 
by-products, economically enabling the process. For this, 
there is a need for knowledge of the behavior of these 
biocatalysts in different reaction systems in order to 
evaluate their activity and conformational change, so they 
can be efficiently used in degradative processes.
The low frequency ultrasound has received increasing 
attention over the past decade for the improvement of 
several biotechnological processes. The use of an ultrasonic 
bath has advantages such as simplicity and low cost. The

most apparent limitations are that the operating frequency 
is usually fixed and power variations can occur within the 
bath, therefore, the standardization of sampling sites is 
essential for comparative purposes.8
For years, ultrasound has been used in various 
applications of biotechnology, i.e., for the purpose of cell 
disruption to release intracellular enzymes and organelles 
that are applied in industry and in medicine. Other 
applications include the easy mass transfer from the cell 
to the solvent, the intensification of cellulose and pectinase 
transfer during the bioprocessing of cotton fabrics and 
during the oxidation of cholesterol to cholestenone by 
Rhodococcus erythropolis  cells. The ultrasound appears 
to influence the reaction kinetics and reduce the time for 
esterification reactions.9
It is also being developed studies on the use of 
microwaves, in order to improve the performance of enzymes 
in reactions on a wide range of applications in different 
areas. The microwaves generate heat inside the reaction 
system, facilitating mass and heat transfer operations by 
accelerating the occurrence of certain reactions, including 
those catalyzed by enzymes. The advantages of using this 
reaction system are the low cost and that it is considered 
a clean method. The effects of microwaves in chemical 
reactions are related with the short-range molecular friction 
due to the continuous polarization of molecules caused by 
microwave irradiation.10,11
Microwaves favor the efficiency of molecular 
collisions due to the orientation of polar molecules 
involved in the reaction. These properties make the 
microwave irradiation an interesting tool for application 
in enzymatic processes, including the activation of 
peroxidases.11 In this context, the aim of this study is to 
evaluate the effect of ultrasound and microwave in the 
enzymatic activity of commercial and noncommercial 
peroxidases extracted from agro-industrial by-products 
aiming to improving wastewater treatment. The literature 
shows a lack of studies that evaluate the changes in 
terms of enzyme activity and stability after exposure to 
ultrasound and microwave irradiation. Specifically on 
peroxidases, no scientific study could be found, showing 
that this one is important for the area, since the enzymes 
under study may be applicable for different purposes, 
especially to improve wastewater treatment.
Experimental
Raw material
The rice bran and soybean meal samples were acquired 
in local agribusiness, packed in appropriate containers at the temperature of 4 °C until the extraction of peroxidase. 
Commercial peroxidases were acquired from Sigma-
Aldrich (type VI, peroxidase obtained from horseradish).
Enzyme extraction study
The extraction of peroxidase was held from the 
agro-industrial by-products, rice bran and soybean meal. 
The initial conditions for enzyme extraction were based 
on the method described by Cardinali et al.,12 where the 
extractor buffer media in a concentration of 5 mmol L-1 
was added to the brans, followed by mechanical agitation 
during 60 min at room temperature, to breakage of cellular 
structure and protein solubilization. The crude enzyme 
extracts from the different experiments were centrifuged 
at 3220 × g for 10 min at a temperature of 4 °C, and the 
supernatants were filtered to quantify the soluble protein 
and the specific peroxidase activity in each test.
Evaluation of enzymes behavior in ultrasound
The effects of ultrasound (Unique Inc., USC-1800A 
model, frequency US 40 kHz and maximum power of 
132 W, 0.42 W cm-2) temperature and power on the 
peroxidases activities were determined by an experimental 
design. To evaluate the effects of ultrasound on the 
enzymes activity, tests were performed in the presence 
and absence of ultrasound irradiation. A central composite 
design (CCRD) was conducted to evaluate the effects 
of temperature and power in the range of 30-80 °C and 
0-60%, respectively, as shown in Table 1. The activity 
was determined according to the procedure described 
below. The exposure time of the enzymes in the conditions 
predetermined by the experimental design was determined 
by performing a kinetic in an ultrasound bath, and the time 
range corresponding to maximum enzyme activity was from 
10 to 20 min. The exposure time was fixed, in 10 minutes, 
in the conditions previously determined by experimental 
design. All results were analyzed using the Statistica 7.0 
software (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA), considering a 
significance level of 95% ( p < 0.05).
Evaluation of peroxidases behavior in microwave
Samples of noncommercial peroxidases and type VI 
peroxidase obtained from horseradish were added in 
5 mmol L-1 phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). These samples were 
treated in microwave (Domestic, Eletrolux, controlled by 
power) for 5, 10 and 15 seconds, where the equivalent 
temperatures were 25, 50 and 70 °C, respectively.Commercial and Noncommercial Peroxidases Activity under Ultrasound and Microwave Treatment J. Braz. Chem. Soc.1892
Stability of the crude and precipitated enzymatic extract at 
low and high temperatures
The stability of all enzymatic extracts at low temperatures 
was studied at 4 and –10 °C by measuring the activities 
each 5 days during storage. The evaluation of stability at 
high temperatures was carried out by incubation at 30, 45 
and 60 ºC. The activity was monitored every 24 h until total 
loss of activity. The enzyme activities were evaluated until 
100 days of storage at all temperatures.
Determination of enzymatic activity
The determination of enzyme activity was performed 
according to Devaiah and Shetty method.13 The reaction 
medium was composed of 1 mL of the enzyme extract, 
1.5 mL of phosphate buffer, 0.50 mL of guaiacol 
0.08 mol L-1 and 1 mL of H2O2 0.08 wt.%, the absorbance of 
the oxidized compounds was obtained in spectrophotometer 
at 470 nm. The enzymatic activity was estimated in terms 
of activity, through the oxidation reaction of the substrate to 
tetraguaiacol characterized by the orange color. One unit of 
peroxidase activity was defined as the protein mass that can 
cause an increase of 0.001 in absorbance unit per minute.14
Treatment of textile synthetic effluent
Aiming at evaluating a preliminary application of the 
enzymes in effluent treatment, 0.3 g of the enzymatic 
extract, treated using ultrasound systems, were weight and 
added to 10 mL of pH 7.5 phosphate buffer (5 mmol L-1). The solubilized extract was subjected to the treatment of 
textile synthetic effluent.
The concentration of the textile synthetic effluent used 
was 100 mg L-1 of the dye 09-Red (Tingecor Guarany 
Ind. Com. Ltda) that presents the following composition: 
sodium chloride, a direct dye and dispersing in distilled 
water. The synthetic effluent sample (0.1 L) was exposed 
to treatment with both noncommercial enzymes, in an 
orbital shaker at 160 rpm. The samples were analyzed for 
the removal of color, using a spectrophotometer at 455 nm. 
All analyzes were performed in triplicate.
Results and Discussion
Evaluation of enzymatic activity in ultrasound
The treatment with ultrasound was evaluated using a 
CCRD 22, which matrix and respective results are shown 
in Table 1. Table 1 also shows the real and coded values 
of the independent variables (power and temperature) 
and the respective responses in terms of relative activity 
to the peroxidases extracted from rice bran (RB) and 
soybean meal (SM). Higher activities were obtained for 
the center point (129.5%) and runs 2, 6 and 1 (128.6, 
123.8 and 121.4%, respectively) using RB. We believe 
that the result obtained in the central point is interesting, 
since intermediate conditions, thinking about economic 
viability, resulted in a relevant activity increase. For the 
enzyme obtained from SM, the highest relative activity 
were 147.9% SM, using a temperature of 55 °C and a power 
of 30%. The central point for both answers showed little

variation, indicating good reproducibility of the process. 
For the peroxidase extracted from RB, the smaller relative 
activities were found in tests 8 (2.4%) followed by test 4 
(7.1%) and test 3 (11.9%). These results are possibly due 
to the high temperatures used during the execution of these 
tests, causing the enzyme denaturation. However, for the 
peroxidase extracted from SM no significant variations 
in the relative activity of the enzyme occurred, when 
compared with the one from RB.
Data presented in Table 1 were statistically treated 
and it was possible to obtain empirical models presented 
in Table 2. These models describe the behavior of the 
noncommercial enzymes after treatment. 
Analysis of variance was used to validate these models 
and as calculated F was higher than listed one, we built the 
response surfaces presented at Figure 1. Considering the 
results obtained for the commercial enzyme, the coded model 
was not validated, so we presented the Pareto chart of effects 
(Figure 2) that presents the effects of the evaluated parameters 
on the enzymatic activity. One can see that the studied 
variables did not influence the enzyme activity in this case.
From these results it was observed that the behavior 
of the enzymatic activity of peroxidase is modified when 
treated with ultrasound. The relative activities obtained 
showed that average conditions of temperature (50 °C) and 
power (30%) generate the best results.
The observed behavior in relation to temperature is 
partially explained in the study of Wang et al .15 which 
stated that the sonication of a liquid causes two main 
effects, cavitation and heating. The shear stress caused 
by collapsing bubbles may slightly promote a heating 
that is not measured due to the sensor position, which can 
result in a local temperature increase, which results in less 
pronounced effects of temperature on the enzyme activity 
in the presence of ultrasound.
It can be noticed a gap in the literature regarding the 
use of ultrasound to increase peroxidase activity, but 
the results of this study are similar to those found for 
other enzymes, such as Souza et al.16 who evaluated the 
commercial enzyme amylase activity under the irradiation 
of ultrasound. For this, they used a design of experiments 
to evaluate the exposure temperature and pH in relation to 
enzymatic activity in the presence and absence of ultrasonic 
irradiation. Results showed that ultrasound changed the enzyme behavior, because it showed superior activity 
compared with the absence of ultrasound.
Evaluation of enzymatic activity in microwave
The results obtained from the treatment performed 
with microwaves in order to activate the commercial and 
noncommercial peroxidases are shown in Table 3. The 
highest relative activity ( p < 0.05) was observed in test 2 
(107.5%) for the peroxidase extracted from RB with 
10 seconds of reaction time and a reaction temperature of 
about 50 °C.

Other authors also note activation of vegetable 
peroxidase after heat treatment. Ciou et al.17 studied the 
effect of heat on the peroxidase activity from water chestnut 
pericarp (Trapa Taiwanensis Nakai). Peroxidase activity, 
originally of 38 units g-1 of sample, increased slightly in 
pericarp samples that were heated from 30 to 40 ºC for 
10-60 min. Furthermore, the peroxidase activity rapidly 
increased when the samples were treated at 50-60 ºC for 
10-60 min. The greater peroxidase activity was at 60 ºC 
with 30 minutes of heat treatment. The peroxidase in this 
vegetable was almost completely inactivated when the 
temperature was increased to 100 ºC in 10 min.
Lopes et al.11 suggested that in the temperatures of 30 
and 45 ºC, interactions in the native state are maximized, 
keeping in the same values the angles of twist and of the 
polypeptide chains and low entropy, explaining the self 
activation of the enzyme.
As can be seen in Table 3, treatment with microwave 
possibly caused enzyme conformational changes, according 
to Lopes et al.11 Small changes in the secondary structure of 
the enzyme at low temperatures (30-45 ºC) have activation 
effect, whereas at highest temperatures the effect on the 
enzyme is deleterious on its activity, as can be observed 
in the test 3 for the enzyme extracted from rice bran. The 
comparison of the obtained results with the literature was 
not possible because, currently, this type of system is only used for enzyme inactivation of the enzyme, what makes 
this work a promising technology for increasing the enzyme 
activity.
Stability of the crude and precipitated enzymatic extracts 
to low and high temperatures
After 160 hours of incubation at 30 °C, almost complete 
deactivation of all enzymes occurred. At 45 ºC the enzymes 
did not present an initial activation, but this extracts kept 
the enzyme activity until 116 hours of incubation. At 60 ºC, 
all extracts lost the activity during the incubation time 
(92 hours) and the commercial enzyme, pretreated using 
ultrasound, was the most heat sensitive (loss of all activity 
after 44 hours of incubation).
The evaluation of low temperature stability showed 
that the enzymes presented higher stabilities. All of them 
kept 100% of their activity until 60 days of storage at 4 
and –10 ºC. 
Treatment of textile synthetic effluent
Preliminary tests of enzyme application showed that the 
higher color removal percentage occurred using 3 mL of 
the enzyme extract and H2O2 concentrations of 40 mg L-1. 
This condition resulted in a color removal of about 40% 
using peroxidases from rice bran. The enzymes extracted 
from SM were not efficient in the color removal, presenting 
results of about 5%.
Conclusions
In this study, experimental data on the effects of 
ultrasound irradiation on the peroxidase activity extracted 
from RB and SM were presented. Ultrasound has changed 
the behavior of the enzyme activity of both peroxidases. 
The results of this study showed that after the treatment 
with ultrasound using a power of 30% and a temperature 
of 55 °C was obtained an increase in the relative activity 
of peroxidases (129.5% RB and 147.9% SM). These 
results enable the definition of the operating ranges of the 
enzymes in terms of residual activity for later application Table 3.  Residual activities of commercial and noncommercial peroxidases treated in microwave

of these as catalysts in reactions of interest. The usage 
of ultrasound proved to be a promising technology to be 
used in enzymatic reactions due to its positive effects on 
peroxidases activities. The study of the effects of treatment 
with microwaves in the enzymatic activity and its structure 
are essential for the viability of using this technique. The 
data obtained in this study suggest that the treatment with 
microwaves is a reaction medium for conducting reactions 
catalyzed by peroxidases because it was possible to increase 
their activity during the performed tests. Preliminary tests 
of enzyme application showed that the higher color removal 
percentage occurred using 3 mL of the enzymes extract and 
H2O2 concentrations of 40 mg L-1. This condition resulted 
in a color removal of about 40%.
