abstract
A lab-scale anoxic-oxic moving bed biofilm reactor (A/O-MBBR) was used to treat simulated 
nitrogenous wastewater. Transition of nitrogenous compounds and total nitrogen (TN) removal 
performance were studied under extreme hydraulic retention time of 8 h. The optimal NH4+–N and 
TN removal performance was achieved with dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 5.4 mg/L in the oxic reactor, which was 72% and 34% with influent NH
4+–N and urea of around 30 and 50 mg/L. 
Polysaccharide concentration, protein concentration and PS/PN fluctuated significantly with the 
variation of DO concentration in the oxic zone, which achieved around 31.8 mg/g VSS, 7.1 mg/g 
VSS and 40, respectively. The fluorescence excitation emission matrix showed different distinct 
peaks under different DO concentration in the oxic zone. Terrimicrobium, a kind of strictly anaerobic 
bacteria, became the main genera when DO concentration was controlled at around 1.9 mg/L in the 
oxic zone according to the results of high-throughput sequencing.

1. Introduction
Anoxic/oxic (A/O) systems have been widely applied 
in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) [1]. However, 
nitrogen removal performance is not desirable usually, due to the disadvantages of conventional active sludge process (ASP), such as low biomass concentration and short sludge retention time (SRT). The discharge of wastewater contain-ing nitrogenous compounds usually leads to eutrophication in the receiving water [2]. Thus, the upgrading of the A/O system is urgent. Recently, moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) have been studied for improvement of nitrogen removal owing to their advantages of high biomass concen-tration, long SRT and low excess sludge production [3–6]. If an A/O system is changed into an MBBR process, the cost of physical infrastructure would be saved, by adding bio- carriers into the reactor solely.
Previous researches indicate that hydraulic retention 
time (HRT) is a key operation parameter in an MBBR sys-tem, related with volume loading and effluent wastewater quality, especially with nitrogen removal. HRT directly influences the fraction of ammonium oxidized bacteria in nitrifying bacteria [7]. A biological treatment system oper -
ated under suitable HRT not only guarantees pollutant removal performance but also saves operation cost. The studies on HRT are focused on optimizing the parameter, for instance, the optimum HRT for the treatment of rural domestic sewage [1], refinery wastewater [8] and tannery wastewater [9]. However, when HRT deviates from its optimal condition, performance of the MBBR system would X.-p. Liu, H.-q. Li / Desalination and Water Treatment 158 (2019) 105–113 106
be affected. Thus, to investigate the threshold of HRT and 
relevant operation condition in an A/O-MBBR system is meaningful, in favor of providing advices for optimizing performance of the A/O-MBBR system. However, rare stud-ies have been done to investigate the effect of ultimate HRT on biological nitrogen removal in the A/O-MBBR system.
By affecting hydraulic loading, HRT impacts microflora 
as well. When the reactors are shocked, the dominant bacteria will change, and the bacteria that have better hydraulic shock resistance performance will be enriched by enlarging HRT [10]. Stable and abundant microbial community structure is the basis of good pollutant removal performance in a biologi-cal wastewater treatment process. In general, sudden change of pollutant treatment performance in biological waste-water treatment process can be explained by the variation of microbial community structure. In this study, a lab-scale A/O-MBBR system was designed to investigate the effect of ultimate HRT at 8 h on nitrogen removal performance from simulated municipal wastewater, along with chemical oxygen demand (COD)  removal performance. The varia-tions of soluble microbial products (SMPs) and fluorescence excitation emission matrix (FEEM) in the effluent of the system were monitored to study the microbial community conditions at different dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the oxic reactor with HRT of 8 h. Moreover, the micro-bial diversity of the biofilm was assessed at the end of each stage, to understand microbial composition of the system under different operation conditions. Two objectives were intended to be achieved in this study. One was the feasibility and stability of the A/O-MBBR system under extreme HRT, being controlled at around 8 h, which was in favor of opti-mizing the volume of the A/O-MBBR system. The other was to investigate the effect of DO concentration on performance of the A/O-MBBR system, which would reduce the cost of wastewater treatment. The results obtained from the study would provide technological support for the upgrade of an A/O system by integrating with the MBBR process.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Lab-scale reactor and bio-carrier
The lab-scale A/O-MBBR system used in the study 
contained anoxic zone (R
A) and oxic zone (RO). Effective 
volume of the reactor was 10.8 L, with length, width and 
height of 40, 10 and 30 cm, respectively. The anoxic zone and oxic zone were 2.7 and 8.1 L, respectively. The diagram of the A/O MBBR system is shown in Fig. 1. Influent of the system was pumped to R
A by a peristaltic pump. Bio-carrier used in 
the reactor was made of polyethylene with cylindrical shape and internal support structure. Specific surface area of the carrier was around 1,200 m
2/m3, and the density was about 
0.98 kg/m3. The filling ratio of the carriers in RA and RO was 
50% and 40%, because the biofilm growth on the carriers in the anoxic condition was more difficult than in the oxic condition. 
2.2. Wastewater characteristics
The wastewater used in this study was prepared 
according to Chu and Wang [11]. Composition of the waste-
water was listed as follows: 300 mg/L of glucose, 50 mg/L of urea, 115 mg/L of NH
4Cl, 20 mg/L of NaH2PO4, 2 mg/L of 
KH2PO4, 4 mg/L of CaCl2, 2 mg/L of MgSO4 and 67 mg/L of 
NaHCO3. The COD, total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen 
(NH4+–N), and total phosphorus (TP) was 320, 53, 30, and 
5 mg/L, respectively.

2.3. Start-up and operation conditions
Inoculum used in the MBBR was taken from a WWTP , 
Chengdu, China. The sludge was acclimated for 5 d with the 
synthetic wastewater before inoculation. At the beginning of 
the start-up period, the initial biomass concentration in the 
RA and RO was around 2,000 and 1,500 mg/L, respectively. 
Carriers were added into the system after the inoculation. Then, the system was operated by intermittent feeding for 10 d, and the synthetic wastewater was fed every 12 h. During the intermittent feeding period, the reaction time and sedimentation time was 11 and 1 h, respectively. After that, continuous influent was adopted with recycle mixed liquor ratio of 50%, and HRT of the system was controlled at 20 h. Specific operation conditions are shown in Table 1. Moreover, DO concentration in the R
O was changed at HRT 
of 8 h to investigate the feasibility of varying DO concen-tration on recovery of the A/O MBBR system performance. Temperature of the R
A and RO was controlled at 25°C ± 2°C 
throughout the experiments. 2.4. Analytical methods
Samples were taken from the influent of the system 
and the effluent of the RA and RO every 2 d, and were ana-
lyzed immediately after being filtered by 0.45 µm filter 
paper. The concentrations of COD, NH4+–N, NO3––N, NO2––N 
and TN were measured according to Monitoring and 
Analytic Methods of Water and Wastewater [12]. Attached sludge concentration was measured according to Ahmadi et al. [13]. Polysaccharide (PS) and protein (PN) concentra-tions were measured once a week. PS concentration was measured by the method of anthranone-sulfuric acid. PN concentration was measured by the method of Lowry [14].  FEEM analysis was conducted by fluorospectro photometer (Hitachi, F-7000). Fluorescence regional integration (FRI) was used to analyse the data of FEEM [15]. DO concentration and temperature were measured by the YSI O
2-electrode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Nitrogen removal performance in the A/O-MBBR system
With influent COD concentration of 312.5 ± 11.3 mg/L, 
effluent of the system was around 25 mg/L in each phase. 
TN removal efficiency of each phase was 19.4% ± 3.1%, 
24.7% ± 6.2%, 22.2% ± 4.2%, and 34.8% ± 3.3%, respectively. Fig. 2 shows specific NO
x––N (NO2––N and NO3––N), NH4+–N 
and TN concentrations of the RA and RO throughout the 
study. Nitrification performance of the system was signifi-
cantly different at different phases. 
In phase I, average effluent NO3––N, NO2––N and NH4+–N 
concentration of the A/O-MBBR system was 23.4 ± 2.0, 2.5 ± 2.3, 14.0 ± 2.0 mg/L, respectively. Average NH
4+–N 
removal performance of the system was 54.5% ± 6.2%. Table 1

Effluent NO2––N and NO3––N concentrations of the RA were 
below 1.0 mg/L, which indicated good denitrification 
performance in the RA under the recycle ratio of 50%. Thus, 
it could be speculated that low TN removal efficiency was 
mainly due to the poor nitrification performance in the RO. 
NH4+–N removal efficiency reached around 95% with HRT 
of 12 h in a single aerobic MBBR [16]. Although HRT of the 
A/O-MBBR system in phase I was longer than the single 
aerobic MBBR, nitrification performance of the system was poorer than the single aerobic MBBR, which would be due to the performance of the biofilm growth on the carriers was not mature in the A/O-MBBR system. 
When HRT was reduced to 8 h in phase II, the quality of 
effluent wastewater did not change immediately. After 98th d, NH
4+–N concentration in the effluent of the RO suddenly 
increased and NO3––N concentration decreased. NO2––N 
accumulation was not observed in the effluent of the RO. It 
was indicated that the relative low nitrification performance caused the low NH
4+–N removal efficiency. It was reported 
that nitrification and denitrification need at least 6 and 2 h in theory [17], and a good nitrification performance was exhibited when HRT was longer than 6 h. Besides reaction time, hydraulic shock must be considered in a continu-ous flow system. As HRT reduced from 20 to 8 h, attached sludge concentration decreased from 1.9 ± 0.3 to 1.4 ± 0.2 g/L in the R
A and dropped from 2.5 ± 0.5 to 2.1 ± 0.2 g/L in the 
RO. Biomass concentration decreased with the enhancement 
of hydraulic shock. Low NH4+–N removal rate showed 
stress of nitrification performance in the RO under HRT of 
6 h. Thus, 8 h of HRT for the A/O-MBBR system was not enough at the operation condition for nitrogen removal, and 6 h of HRT for the R
O was insufficient for good nitrification 
performance. 
Reducing DO concentration in the RO in phase III had no 
obvious effects on increase of nitrogen removal performance compared with phase II. TN removal rate decreased by around 2% from phase II to III. Effluent NO
3––N concentra-
tion of the RA and RO was maintained at a low level. Effluent 
NO2––N concentration of the system decreased from 5.6 to 
0.3 mg/L and then increased to 9.0 mg/L, while the variation of effluent NH
4+–N concentration showed an opposite trend. 
NO2––N accumulation indicated recovery of nitrification 
performance. Moreover, the potential of short-cut simulta-neous nitrification and denitrification (SSND) was observed in the R
O. A response surface model of the MBBR achieving 
SSND suggested the optimum condition was at HRT of 8 h and DO concentration of 3 mg/L [5]. The relative HRT and DO concentration in the R
O caused the possibility of SSND. 
Therefore, HRT of 6 h and DO concentration of around 
1.9 mg/L in the RO was not a suitable operation condition 
for nitrification, and enhancement of DO concentration 
in the RO would promote nitrification performance of the 
reactor.
Increasing DO concentration in the RO improved nitri-
fication and TN removal performance promptly and sig-nificantly. At phase IV , average NH
4+–N removal rate 
was 72.5% ± 4.2%, with average effluent concentration of 
8.3 ± 1.1 mg/L. Effluent NO3––N and NO2––N concentrations 
of the RO were 25.9 ± 2.4 mg/L and 1.1 ± 0.5 mg/L. From 
phase III to IV , attached sludge concentration increased from 2.8 ± 0.5 to 3.0 ± 0.3 g/L in the RA, and increased from 
1.6 ± 0.2 to 2.2 ± 0.2 g/L in the RO. The improvement of 
attached sludge concentration was one of the reasons why NH
4+–N removal efficiency increased. The A/O-MBBR sys-
tem achieved NH4+–N rate of 98.4% under HRT of 9 h and 
DO concentration higher than 2.0 mg/L [18]. Moreover, TN removal rate achieved around 72% in an MBBR-MBR process at HRT of 9.5 h [19]. Moreover, DO concentration of 5.4 mg/L was another reason for improving nitrification performance in the R
O, although the NH4+–N removal rate was still lower 
than the previous study. It could be speculated that the difference of HRT was the reason why NH
4+–N removal effi-
ciency of the two systems was different. Only 1 h more in 
the HRT, the A/O-MBBR system got more than around 26% of NH
4+–N removal rate and higher than 40% of TN removal 
percentage, which indicated that 8 h of HRT was a limita-tion for the system to achieve good nitrification performance even though DO concentration was high. The A/O-MBBR system exhibited good COD and TN removal performance at relative low HRT, which would reduce the cost on municipal wastewater treatment. For a large-scale wastewater treatment process, comparing with the ASP-based A/O system, the car -
riers added in the MBBR process and the transformation of wastewater outlet would induce higher cost (around 10%). However, the relative high hydraulic load could reduce the volume of the WWTP , which would compensate the cost for the alteration of the MBBR process to a large extent. 
3.2. SMP and FRI analysis
SMPs were produced by the decay of active biomass 
and the hydrolysis of bound extracellular polymeric sub-
stances (EPS) [20]. In the wastewater treatment system, SMPs 
may affect effluent quality and bring potential pollutant in 
the received water [15]. As a protective mechanism, abnor -
mal situation of SMPs would indicate abnormity of running conditions [21]. PS and PN were the main components of 
SMP [22]. By FRI analysis, main substances would be distin-
guished. Variations of PS and PS concentrations and FEEM 
analysis would be helpful in checking the statement of the system. Fig. 3 shows the PS and PN concentrations of the R
A and RO throughout all phases. Fig. 4 shows the FEEM 
images of eight samples taken from the RA and RO in the four 
different phases, respectively. 
As can be seen from Fig. 3, PS and PN concentrations 
varied as operation conditions changed. PN concentration of  
both RA and RO changed a little, while PS concentration 
changed a lot. The variation of PS and PN concentrations was because PS was the main component of EPS when temperature was controlled between 20°C and 30°C [23]. From phase I to IV , average PS concentration of the R
A was 
7.0 ± 2.3 mg/g VSS, 1.7 ± 0.4 mg/g VSS, 3.9 ± 2.4 mg/g VSS, 
and 3.3 ± 1.2 mg/g VSS, respectively. Average PS concen-
tration of RO was 17.4 ± 4.1 mg/g VSS, 7.4 ± 8.2 mg/g VSS, 
16.7 ± 10.0 mg/g VSS and 17.7 ± 3.7 mg/g VSS, respectively. PS concentration of R
A and RO decreased from phase I to 
II. SMP concentration would decrease when the biomass 
was formed. Before day 103, the range of PS concentration 
was 1.2–5.8  mg/g VSS. At day 103, PS concentration sharply 
increased to 25.3  mg/g VSS, which could be explained by the 109 X.-p. Liu, H.-q. Li / Desalination and Water Treatment 158 (2019) 105–113
sudden decrease of effluent NO3––N concentration of the RO, 
since shortage of NO3––N would lead to increase of SMPs 
production [22]. Although NO3––N concentration increased 
at phase IV , PS concentration was still higher than that at 
early phase II. The results indicated the decay of active bio-mass [20]. Thus, the operation condition may not be suitable for the activity of microflora in the system. The variation of PS concentration may be a signal for the biological nitrogen removal system. The change of PS concentration showed that HRT of 8 h was not applicable for the A/O-MBBR system to remove TN. When PS concentration suddenly increased, it was necessary to change the operation condition of the A/O-MBBR system to keep TN removal performance.
Fig. 4 shows EEM results among different phases in 
R
A and RO. From phase I to II, in RA (Fig. 4a and c), peak 
1 was narrowed and peak 4 disappeared, while peaks 2 and 5 appeared. According to FRI, peak 1 represented tyrosine-, protein-like, protein-like and tryptophan, while 
peak 2 represented tyrosine and BOD. The main substances 
of peak 4 and 5 were polyaromatic-type humic acid and 
humus, respectively. In R
O, the intensity of peak 1, 3 and 4 
receded. Main substance of peak 3 was PS, in accordance with FRI. At phase III, only peak 1 left both in R
A and RO, 
and the range and intensity of peak 1 significantly reduced. Nitrification performance and TN removal performance was poor in phase III, especially, thus electronic accepter (NO
x––N) recycled from RO to RA was lack in RA. To resist the 
shock, SMPs would be biodegraded by bacteria flora [24]. Once nitrification performance was recovered, peaks 1 and 2 reappeared in R
A, and peaks 2 and 4 reformed in RO. In 
view of nitrogen removal performance described above, TN removal performance improved at phase II and IV and peak 2 appeared. It could be speculated that tyrosine contrib-
uted to the removal of nitrogen. Previous studies reported 
that growth of certain bacteria and decomposition of dead 
cells and macromolecular organics also led to changes of peaks [25,26]. 
3.3. Variation of microbial construction 
High-throughput sequencing was used to understand 
microbial construction under different conditions. The val-
ues of chao 1 and the quantity of phyla and genera of each sample are shown in Table 2. Biodiversity of the R
A and RO 
in phase I was less than other phases, which indicated that shortening HRT of the system had no obvious effect on the biodiversity of the R
A and RO. Compared with phase I, 
the values of Chao 1 in the RA and RO increased by about 
185 times and 100 times in phase II, respectively. Quantities of phyla and genera also increased sharply. It indicated that as the system running, the microbial community became more and more abundant. However, the low DO concentra-tion made the quantities of phyla and genera in the R
A and 
RO decreased. When DO concentration rose to 5.4 mg/L in 
phase IV , the values of Chao1 in the RA and RO increased 
by around two times, and the quantity of phyla and genera recovered. Fig. 5 shows specific phyla and genera of each phase. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia were the main phyla. When HRT was reduced from 20 h to 8 h, the ratio of main phyla changed. In the R
A, the per -
centage of Proteobacteria increased from 36.9% to 74.8%, as percentage of Bacteroidetes decreased from 52.7% to 12.5%. In the R
O, the percentage of Proteobacteria decreased from 
66.3% to 44.8%, and Verrucomicrobia became one of the dominate phyla, accounting for 14.2%, and the main genus was Terrimicrobium (5.4% in all genera). Terrimicrobium is 
a strict anaerobic, mesophilic, carbohydrate-fermenting bacterium and oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur and Fe (III) nitrilotriacetate do not serve as electron acceptors for growth [27]. 
The change of DO concentration in the R
O affected 
microbial community structure in the RA and RO. When 
DO concentration was controlled at around 1.9 mg/L, 
Verrucomicrobia accounted for 39.4% in the RO, in which 
Terrimicrobium played an important role of the phyla (34.5% 
in all genera). As strict anaerobic bacteria, Terrimicrobium

became dominant bacteria in the oxic reactor, which was 
traceable in phase II. According to the poor nitrogen removal 
performance at phase II and III, Terrimicrobium was an indi-
cator for the deterioration of nitrogen removal performance. 
As DO concentration in the RO decreased, the environment 
was more suitable for the growth of Terrimicrobium. Growth of the aerobic bacteria was inhibited significantly. The Terrimicrobium had no impacts on nitrification and denitrification performance. Moreover, poor nitrification performance of the R
O meant little NOx––N was recycled to 
RA. Thus the denitrification bacteria lost superiority com-
pared with other bacteria in the RA. Tolumonas was the 
dominant genera of RA at phase III, accounting for 34.5%, by 
which NOx––N would not be removed. As DO concentration Table 2

of RO increased, the percentage of Proteobacteria in the RA 
slightly increased from 65.3% to 69.4%, while Bacteroidetes 
decreased from 15.7% to 7.7%. At the meanwhile, the per -
centages of Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes increased from 36.0% to 57.4% and from 4.2% to 25.1% in the R
O, 
respectively, while Verrucomicrobia sharply decreased from 39.7% to 4.3%. In genus level, percentage of nitrifying bacteria in the R
O increased from 0.6% to 1.9%. However, 
nitrifying bacteria was still not the dominant bacteria in the 
RO. It explained that although nitrogen removal performance 
improved, NH4+–N removal efficiency was not high. DO 
concentration of 5.4 mg/L was sufficient for nitrifying bacte-
ria, but nitrifying bacteria did not gain advantages over other bacteria. It indicated that HRT of 6 h in the aerobic MBBR 
was adverse to the growth of nitrifying bacteria.
4. Conclusion
The A/O-MBBR system was used to treat simulated 
municipal wastewater with HRT of 8 h. With average influent 
COD concentration of 312.5 mg/L, effluent COD concentra-tion of the system was around 25 mg/L in each phase. When HRT of the system was maintained at 8 h and DO concentra-tion in the oxic reactor was controlled at around 5.4 mg/L, average NH
4+–N removal rate achieved about 72.5% and 
average TN removal efficiency was around 34.8% at reflux ratio of 50%. The results of SMP and FEEM indicated that microorganisms were under self-protection conditions with HRT of 8 h, especially when DO concentration in the R
O 
was 1.9 mg/L. According to the results of high-throughput sequencing, HRT of 6 h in the R
O was adverse to the growth 
of nitrifying bacteria.
