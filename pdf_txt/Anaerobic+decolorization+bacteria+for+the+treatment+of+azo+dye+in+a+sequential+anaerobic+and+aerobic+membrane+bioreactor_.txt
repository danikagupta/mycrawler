Multiple stage anaerobic system was found to be an effective strategy for reductive decolorization of azo dyes in 
the presence of sulfate. Bulk color removal (56–90%) was achieved concomitant with acidogenic activity in the 
1st-stage reactor (R1), while organic matter removal (≼100%) and sulfate reduction (≼100%) occurred pre-
dominantly in the 2nd-stage reactor (R2). However, azo dye reduction mechanism and metabolic routes involved 
remain unclear. The involved microbial communities and conditions affecting the azo dye removal in a two-stage 
anaerobic digestion (AD) system were elucidated using amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA , fhs, dsrB and mcrA ) and 
correlation analysis. Reductive decolorization was found to be co-metabolic and mainly associated with 
hydrogen-producing pathways. We also found evidence of the involvement of an azoreductase from Lactococcus 
lactis. Bacterial community in R1 was sensitive and shifted in the presence of the azo dye, while microorganisms 
in R2 were more protected. Higher diversity of syntrophic-acetate oxidizers, sulfate reducers and methanogens in 
R2 highlights the role of the 2nd-stage in organic matter and sulfate removals, and these communities might be 
involved in further transformations of the azo dye reduction products. The results improve our understanding on 
the role of different microbial communities in anaerobic treatment of azo dyes and can help in the design of 
better solutions for the treatment of textile effluents.

21.Introduction 
Use of multiple stage anaerobic systems can improve reductive 
decolorization of azo dyes by channeling electrons to preferentially 
reduce azo bonds in the 1st-stage of the anaerobic digestion (AD), 
whereas organic matter and sulfate removals are achieved in the 
following unit with enhanced performance (Oliveira et al., 2022 ). In this 
system ’s configuration, it is expected that distinct microbial commu -
nities will stablish in each stage as a result of the different operating 
conditions applied (Baldi et al., 2019 ; Demirel and Yenigün, 2002 ). 
Acidogens, acetogens and methanogens grow at their optimal 
ecophysiological conditions, resulting in a better overall process sta-
bility compared to single stage anaerobic treatment (García-Depraect 
et al., 2022 ). Understanding the role of these microbial communities on 
the biodegradation of azo dyes can help in the designing of better so-
lutions for the treatment of textile wastewaters. 
The conversion of carbohydrates into organic acids occurs in the 
earliest stage of AD in reactions carried by acidogenic bacteria (Cohen 
et al., 1980 ; García-Depraect et al., 2022 ). In the following step, ace-
togens and methanogens form syntrophic associations to produce 
methane (Stams and Plugge, 2009 ). Under specific conditions, acetic -
lastic methanogens are inhibited and the Wood –Ljungdahl pathway is 
inversed (Müller et al., 2013 ). This rather results in formation of 
H2CO2 from acetate by the syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacterial 
(SAOB) community. All these communities are possibly involved in 
reductive decolorization of azo dyes to a greater or lesser extent. 
Some microbial populations play a controversial role in anaerobic 
treatment of azo dyes. Sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) community was 
found to compete for electrons with azo reducers (Oliveira et al., 2022 ; 
Santos et al., 2007 ), sometimes impairing the reductive decolorization 
process (Amaral et al., 2014 ). Nevertheless, decolorization coupled to 
sulfate reduction was observed before (Albuquerque et al., 2005 ) and 
biogenic sulfide can chemically reduce the azo bonds (Prato-Garcia 
et al., 2013 ; Zeng et al., 2021 ). It was hypothesized that whether SRB 
populations act opposing or in favor of reductive decolorization rather 
depends on the microbial interspecies interactions and on the 
biochemical reactions that they are mediating in the system. 
Moreover, it is not clear whether mixed microbial cultures rely on 
specialized enzymes for biodegrading azo dyes. More than a decade ago, 
Santos et al. (2007) stated that the main mechanism is likely a 
co-metabolic reaction in which reducing equivalents, as well as reduced 
cofactors, work as secondary electron donors to cleave the azo bonds. By 
that time, there were evidence of azoreductases among aerobic bacteria, 
but no proof in anaerobic microorganisms (Santos et al., 2007 ; Stolz, 
2001 ). Later on, Morrison et al. (2012) isolated and characterized an 
anaerobic azoreductase from Clostridium perfringens . Decolorization of 
azo dyes by other enzymes from the oxidoreductase enzyme system, 
including laccases, NADH –DCIP reductases, veratryl alcohol oxidases, 
tyrosinases, riboflavin reductases, and lignin and manganese peroxi -
dases was recently reported among pure and co-cultures of microor -
ganisms (Ali et al., 2020 ; Kurade et al., 2017 ; Saratale et al., 2013 ; 
Waghmode et al., 2011 , 2019 ). Additionally, synergistic action of 
different oxidoreductase enzymes was proved to enhance decolorization 
efficiency (Mendes et al., 2011 ), suggesting that many microbial com-
munities degrade azo dyes through distinct metabolic routes. 
This study proposes to bridge the gap between the microbial com-
munities involved in the decolorization of azo dyes in anaerobic treat-
ment systems and the underlying mechanism. The overall bacterial, 
SAOB, methanogenic, SRB communities were monitored using amplicon 
sequencing of the 16 S rRNA and functional genes. Efficiency parameters 
were correlated with the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and 
metabolites in the system to elucidate the main pathways involved. 
Sulfidogenic conditions were further applied because sulfate is a com-
mon constituent of textile wastewater (Amaral et al., 2014 ). We provide 
valuable insights into the anaerobic treatment of azo dyes that can help 
to better understand how syntrophic microbial communities degrade azo dyes. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Reactor setup and operational strategies 
Two anaerobic reactors were operated continuously over a period of 
328 days. The two-phase anaerobic digestion system was composed of a 
1st-stage anaerobic structured-bed reactor (R1) and a 2nd-stage upflow 
anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (R2) running in series and under 
mesophilic conditions (30 •C). In R1, the fixed-bed was built with 
polyurethane foam strips (10 ×10 ×650 mm). R1 was operated with a 
theoretical chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 28.7 gCOD≡d 1 (organic 
loading rate 11.7 gCOD≡L 1≡d 1) and R2 was operated with 2.7 
gCOD≡d 1 (organic loading rate 2.0 gCOD≡L 1≡d 1). Respective hy-
draulic retention times were 3.5 and 16 h. 
R1 was fed with synthetic textile wastewater composed of: Direct 
Black 22, DB22 (0–65 mg L 1), glucose (1.70 gCOD≡L 1), KH2PO4 (0.25 
g L 1), Na2SO4 (0–0.50 g L 1), NaCl (0.50 g L 1), yeast extract (0.20 g 
L 1), NaHCO 3 (0.15 g≡g-1≡COD) and 1 mL L 1 trace elements solution 
(supplementary material ). The pH of the feed was kept at 7.0 ±0.1. R2 
was fed with the effluent from R1 after the addition of NaHCO 3 (0.70 g 
L 1) to raise pH to 6.0. Bioreactors were inoculated with anaerobic 
sludge from a full scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor, located 
in the city of Pereira – SP, processing wastewater from a poultry 
slaughterhouse. For R1, methanogenic archaea were inactivated by 
heat-treating the sludge (100 •C, 1 h) previously to inoculation (Wang 
and Yin, 2017 ). 
Strategies used in the operation of the AD system were as following: 
startup and stabilization period with no addition of DB22 or SO42 (Phase 
PI); addition of 32.5 mg≡L 1 DB22 (Phase PII); addition of both 32.5 
mg≡L 1 DB22 and 338 mg≡L 1 SO42 (Phase PIII); and addition of 65.0 
mg≡L 1 DB22 and 338 mg≡L 1 SO42 (Phase PIV). 
2.2. Microbial sampling and DNA extraction 
Biofilm from R1 and R2 was sampled at different times of each phase 
after system ’s performance was stable. In R1, samples were harvested 
from the bottom biomass of the polyurethane foam used as support for 
growth. In R2, samples were collected from the sludge blanket (lower 
portion). Genomic DNA was extracted using the FastDNA ® Spin Kit for 
Soil (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, USA) and following the manufac -
turer ’s protocols. DNA quantification was assessed using the Quant-iT ™ 
High-Sensitivity DNA Assay Kit on a plate reader (TECAN Infinite 
M1000) and integrity was evaluated using the TapeStation 2200 with 
genomic DNA ScreenTapes (Agilent, USA). 
2.3. Amplicon sequencing 
PCR reactions targeting the V4 variable region of the bacterial 16 S 
rRNA gene and the functional genes formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase 
(fhs), dissimilatory sulfite reductase β-subunit (dsrB), and methyl 
coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA ) were further conducted to investigate the 
SAOB, SRB and methanogenic communities, respectively. Correspond -
ing primer sets are shown in the supplementary materials section. 
Thermocycler settings were as following: initial denaturation at 95 •C 
for 2 min; amplification for 25 cycles at 95 •C for 15 s, 50 •C for 15 s, and 
72 •C for 60 s; and a final extension of 5 min at 72 •C. Number of cycles, 
annealing temperature and extension time were appropriately adjusted 
according to the target gene, as shown in the supplementary materials. 
Sample preparation was conducted similarly to that described elsewhere 
(Agneessens et al., 2017 ), except that for fhs a 200 ng of extracted DNA 
was used as template. J.M.S. Oliveira et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chemosphere 310 (2023) 136731
32.4. Bioinformatics processing and statistical analysis 
Bioinformatic processing was conducted using the AmpProc 5.1 
pipeline (https://github.com/eyashiro/AmpProc ), based on 
USEARCH11 (Edgar, 2013 ) and QIIME 1.9.1 (Caporaso et al., 2010 ). For 
16 S rRNA gene, fhs and dsrB amplicons, taxonomy was assigned using 
MiDAS 4.8.1 (Dueholm et al., 2021 ), AcetoBase (Singh et al., 2019 ) and 
a database of dsrAB sequences (Müller et al., 2015 ). For mcrA , a custom 
database of representative reference sequences was obtained from the 
Functional Gene Repository (FunGene; http://fungene.cme.msu.edu/ ). 
Statistical analysis were performed in R version 4.0.1 via RStudio 
version 2021.09.0 (http://www.rstudio.com ) using the R CRAN pack-
age ampvis (v2.7.11) (Albertsen et al., 2015 ). Structure and differences 
between microbial communities were assessed using heatmaps and 
non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis. Sequences were 
deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database under 
accession number PRJEB52299. 
2.5. Analytical methods and performance evaluation 
COD, pH and standard reduction potential (E0’) were measured ac-
cording to APHA (2005) . Sulfide interference on COD analysis was 
previously eliminated with zinc sulfate addition. For color analysis, 
samples were appropriately diluted with phosphate buffer (10.86 g L 1 
NaH 2PO4 and 5.98 g L 1 Na2HPO 4) (Firmino et al., 2010 ) and assessed 
according to the spectra record method (Wu et al., 1998 ; APHA, 2005 ). 
Soluble carbohydrates (CH) and lactic acid were determined as previ -
ously described (DuBois et al., 1956 ; Taylor, 1996 ). For E0’ profiling in 
R1, samples were collected at different heights (155, 305, 455, 630 and 
750 mm) with the aid of a syringe and transferred to vacuum blood 
collection tubes. Samples were handled in an anaerobic chamber with 
N2 atmosphere. VFAs (C2–C6) and solvents were analyzed by gas 
chromatography (Adorno et al., 2014 ). 
COD removal (in %) and conversion of CH (CH%, in %) were 
calculated using Eq. (1).

in which X is either COD removal or CH conversion, Xfeed is the

in which Afeed is the absorbance of the feed; Aeffl is the absorbance of 
the effluent; and dλ is an infinitesimal wavelength interval. 2.6. Data analysis 
Pearson ’s correlation analyses were performed in R version 4.0.1 via 
RStudio version 2021.09.0 using the R CRAN package corrplot (https 
://github.com/taiyun/corrplot ). A significance level of p ≼0.05 was 
used. 
3.Results and discussion 
3.1. Two-stage AD system ’s overall performance 
The two-stage AD system was operated for 328 days to investigate 
how the performance was affected by loading of color and exposure to 
sulfate. In R1, COD removal efficiencies were below 20% during the 
entire operation (Table 1) and the volumetric methane production rate 
rarely exceeded 50 mL≡L 1≡d 1. R1 achieved an average decolorization 
efficiency of 69 ±13% when a DB22 loading rate of approximately 222 
mg≡L 1≡d 1 was applied in phase PII. Although sulfate was added to the 
feed as from phase PIII (338 mg≡L 1≡SO42 ), sulfidogenic activity in R1 
was minimal (median sulfate removal 3.5%, interquartile range 8.3) 
and did not impair color removal performance. R2 achieved over 97% of 
COD and almost 100% sulfate removal efficiencies. Mass balance anal-
ysis showed that methanogenesis and sulfidogenesis demanded nearly 
all the electrons in R2, meaning that the use of a two-stage anaerobic 
system was important to alleviate the demand of both these processes for 
reducing equivalents in R1, driving electrons preferentially to reduce the 
azo dye. Further information on the performance of the two-stage AD 
system, including the mass balance analysis, had been published else-
where (Oliveira et al., 2022 ). 
3.2. Azo dye decolorization is mediated by electron shuttles 
Color removal profiling in R1 was assessed after performance was 
stable (Fig. 1-A). The highest increment in color removal was observed 
between the sampling points a and b, where decolorization increased 
from 33 to 90% (as compared to the system ’s influent). Surprisingly, 
color removal efficiency decreased in samples taken in sampling point c 
(decolorization 67%), and further fluctuated across the reactor ’s 
profile. This suggests that intermediates produced after the cleavage of 
the azo bonds were reoxidized in particular zones of the reactor, 
resulting in the formation of newer azo bonds. It is well known that 
exposure of byproducts from reductive decolorization to atmospheric 
oxygen causes the formation of color (Menezes et al., 2019 ; Oliveira 
et al., 2020 ), since hydrazine groups and/or azo anion free radicals in 
the molecules react with oxygen (Zimmermann et al., 1982 ). However, 
there are no studies reporting the reoxidation of aromatic amines inside 
anaerobic digestors themselves, causing cyclic increases and decreases 
in color removal across the reactor ’s profile.

4Sampling along R1 further revealed strong zonation with different 
redox potentials. This reduction potential (E0’) profiling in R1 provided 
valuable insight into the mechanism of color removal across the 1st- 
stage reactor ’s vertical profile. The lower portion of R1, which in-
cludes sampling points a and b, presented more reduced conditions 
(E0’~  200 mV). This is probably because CH conversion reactions into 
VFAs occurred in the bottom of the reactor (Supplementary material ). 
Moreover, it was previously observed that biohydrogen (bioH 2) pro-
duction from sugars mainly occurs in the basal portion of fixed-bed re-
actors (Fuess et al., 2021 ), supporting the hypothesis that the DB22 
reduction mechanism is governed by – but not limited to – co-metabolic 
reactions, in which reducing equivalents or reduced cofactors such as 
NADH act as secondary electrons donors to cleave azo bonds (Santos 
et al., 2007 ). 
In the intermediary zone (sampling point c), E0 increased to  49 mV, 
and DB22 intermediates reoxidized as a result of the less reduced con-
ditions. E0 values decreased to  93 mV, and further to  188 mV in 
sampling points d and e, respectively, causing color removal efficiencies 
to rise again, oscillating between 81 and 86%. Upon exposure of the 
effluent to the atmosphere for approximately 30 min, E0 increased to 
 51 mV and decolorization decreased to 51%. After repeated mea-
surements were taken across the R1’s profile (Fig. 1-B), we confirmed 
that color removal is negatively correlated with E0 in system (R  0.64; 
p 0.045). 
The rate of azo reduction has previously been shown to depend on 
the dye redox potential if the rate-limiting step involves a redox equi-
librium between the azo molecule and a reducing agent (Dubin and 
Wright, 1975 ). The mechanism hypothesized involves a redox cycle in which a redox mediator transfer electrons between the enzyme and the 
substrate (Fig. 2). Reduction of the azo dye (R1-N––N-R 2) to its hydrazo 
intermediate (R1-HN–NH–R2) will only occur if the mediator is present 
in sufficient concentrations and shifted toward a reduced form (Dubin 
and Wright, 1975 ). High concentrations of the reduced mediator will 
result in decreased E0 values, and electron transfer to azo compounds 
will happen once the redox potential in the environment approach that 
of the dye. However, this last reaction is reversible as long as the 
hydrazo intermediate is not further degraded. It can be hypothesized 
that the equilibrium shifted towards re-oxidation of DB22 intermediates 
(e.g., hydrazo to azo) as reduction potential in the system increased due 
to consumption of mediators in the reduced form, causing reappearance 
of color in the upper portion of R1. 
3.3. Co-metabolic routes involved in reductive decolorization 
Conversion of carbohydrates occurred in R1 with efficiencies of 
approximately 99% throughout the 328 days of operation. Production of 
VFAs and metabolites in the effluent after R1 was monitored and is 
shown in the supplementary materials section. 
Butyrate-type fermentation was the main pathway observed during 
the stabilization phase. Median concentrations of HBu and HAc were, 
respectively, 295 mg≡L 1 (interquartile range 245) and 154 mg≡L 1 
(interquartile range 220) in this period, which accounts for a HBu/ 
HAc ratio of 1.91. In phases PII and PIII (32.5 mg≡L 1 DB22), HBu/HAc 
ratios decreased to 0.79 and 0.98, while HPr concentrations remained 
similar (PI: median 132 mg≡L 1, interquartile range 117; PII: median 
118 mg≡L 1, interquartile range 46; and PIII: median 156 mg≡L 1,

Oliveira et al.

5interquartile range 82). These results indicate the predominance of 
the acetic pathway (Table 2, Eq. 2) during most of the operation with the 
azo dye, which is usually associated with higher bioH 2 production rates 
from CH when compared to other more reduced metabolites (Fernandes 
et al., 2010 ; Fuess et al., 2016 ). 
The involvement of the acetic fermentation pathway on reductive 
decolorization is further supported by results from Pearson ’s correlation 
test (R 0.48, p 0.001) performed with samples collected all over the 
operation (Fig. 3-A). Butyrate fermentation (Table 2, Eq. 3), another 
hydrogen-producing reaction, was also significant for color removal (R 
0.35, p 0.021). Since bioH 2 was not released in the biogas phase 
(Oliveira et al., 2022 ), some of the reducing power generated via these 
metabolic routes might have been consumed during co-metabolic 
decolorization of DB22. 
The strongest correlation was found to be between decolorization 
and CH% (R 0.60, p D0.001). In fact, the catabolism of glucose to 
pyruvate yields two NADH molecules (Table 2, Eq. 1), which can serve 
as reducing power for the cleavage of azo bonds. Moreover, glycolysis is 
the precursor of all mixed acid fermentation reactions and acidogenesis 
was found to be a critical step in AD of azo dyes (Firmino et al., 2010 ; Li 
et al., 2014 ). 
Interestingly, metabolites produced via hydrogen-consuming re-
actions such as n-valeric acid (Table 2, Eq. 9), ethanol (Table 2, Eq. 10) 
and methanol (Table 2, Eq. 11) were also positively correlated with 
color removal. For instance, n-valerate elongation from propionate 
consumes six mols of H2. Both ethanol and methanol formation obtain 
reducing power from NADHH. Nevertheless, the correlations be-
tween these metabolites and reductive decolorization may reflect the 
fermentative diversity in R1 rather than causation directly. Several 
studies have shown the benefits of metabolic diversity on decolorization 
of azo dyes by mixed microbial cultures due to the synergistic action of 
different enzymes from the oxidoreductase system. Observed increases 
in the activities of NADH-DCIP reductases, azoreductases, veratryl 
alcohol oxidases and laccases after decolorization of textile effluents by 
microbial consortiums rather than in controls with the respective indi-
vidual isolates were previously observed (Kurade et al., 2017 ; Phugare 
et al., 2011 ). In another study, decolorization was found to be correlated 
with higher microbial diversity in batch experiments, further supporting 
the relevance of metabolic diversity in the biodegradation of azo dyes 
(Oliveira et al., 2020 ). Finally, production and accumulation of metabolites such as ethanol may stimulate other hydrogen-producing 
routes, e.g., chain elongation to n-caproic acid production (Cavalcante 
et al., 2017 ), therefore explaining the positive correlation between 
ethanol and decolorization. 
Pearson ’s correlation analysis was also performed separately for 
each system ’s operational strategy. In phase PII (32.5 mg≡L 1 DB22), 
decolorization was significantly correlated with CH% and the produc -
tion of HBu, HVa, HCa and ethanol (Fig. 3-B). Production of n-caproic 
acid from both ethanol and lactic acid yields bioH 2 that can be used as 
reducing power for reductive decolorization (Table 2, Eq. 4-5). Ethanol 
elongation to n-caproic acid likely occurred because both ethanol and 
acetic acid were present in phase PII, and ethanol concentrations were 
strongly correlated with those of n-caproic acid (R 0.55, p 0.040). 
Moreover, lactic acid was detected in samples collected all over PII 
operation at concentrations ranging from 10 to 32 mg L 1. Given the 
high abundance of homolactic bacteria in R1 (see Topic 3.6), lactic acid 
was probably utilized to generate n-caproic acid. It can therefore be 
hypothesized that decolorization of DB22, in phase PII, was mainly 
driven by reactions involved in chain elongation for n-caproate 
production. 
Addition of sulfate (338 mg L 1 SO42 ), in phase PIII, did not appear 
to affect decolorization and CH% efficiencies in R1 (Fig. 3-C). Effluent 
sulfate concentrations remained similar and, sometimes, slightly higher 
than those measured in the feed tank. In fact, the 1st-stage reactor was 
designed with the aim of preventing sulfidogenesis, thus avoiding 
competition between the azo dye and sulfate for reducing equivalents. 
Although no sulfate removal occurred in R1, Pearson ’s correlation 
analysis results showed that distinct metabolic routes were involved in 
DB22 decolorization in phase PIII. Decolorization was positively corre -
lated with acetone formation (R 0.57, p 0.018), which is a bioH 2 
producing reaction (Table 2, Eq. 6), and negatively associated with HBu 
concentration (R  0.51, p 0.035) in this period. The later suggests 
that the decrease in HBu/HAc ratio occurred as a result of butyrate 
oxidation (Table 2, Eq. 7), which leads do the production of bioH 2 that 
can serve as additional electron donor for reductive decolorization. The 
findings agree with previous studies in which the presence of an azo dye 
led to higher decomposition of VFAs (propionate and butyrate) into 
acetate, compared to a control without azo dye (Li et al., 2014 ). The 
authors hypothesized that bioH 2 produced in acetification of VFAs 
served as additional reducing power for reductive decolorization. This 
was further supported by results from enzymatic assays, which showed 
that azoreductase activity was higher in the presence of butyrate and 
propionate than acetate. 
After applied DB22 loading rate was increased to 438 ±13 
mg≡L 1≡d 1 (65 mg≡L 1, Phase PIV), we observed a lower metabolic 
diversity in R1 (Fig. 3-D). Methanol, ethanol and acetone were not 
detected as from the 5th day after transition to phase PIV, and HBu/HAc 
ratio increased to 1.70. Moreover, no correlations were found between 
the produced metabolites and decolorization. This period of operation 
was marked by a decrease in decolorization efficiencies in R1, with later 
stabilization at lower removal rates. This further supports our hypoth -
esis that a higher metabolic diversity is beneficial for reductive decol -
orization of azo dyes. 
3.4. Overall bacterial community and sensitivity of acidogens towards azo 
dye 
After a DB22 loading rate of 222 ±9 mg≡L 1≡d 1 (32.5 mg≡L 1, 
Phase PII) was applied to R1, CH% had a sudden drop from approxi -
mately 99 to 70%, with gradual recovery in the following weeks (Oli-
veira et al., 2022 ). This suggests that microorganisms adapted to the dye 
and to intermediates of the reductive decolorization. However, this 
could also mean that a microbial community with different structure 
was stablished in the system. Molecular identification of microorgan -
isms based on the 16 S rRNA and functional genes was further conducted 
to understand the possible causes. Table 2

6Amplicon sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene targeting the V4 region 
revealed a significant shift in the bacterial community structure in R1 
after DB22 was added to the system, in phase PII (Fig. 4-A). Samples 
clustered into four groups, of which each one represented a different 
operational strategy. DB22 was found to be the main source of variation 
in the dataset, since samples from phase PI (operation without the azo 
dye) clustered separately on the left side of NMDS1 axis, apart from the 
other phases, which grouped to the right side. Within this main group, 
samples from phase PII (operation with no sulfate addition) clustered in 
the upper-right quadrant, while samples from phases PIII and PIV (338 
mg≡L 1 SO42 added to the feed) grouped in the lower-right portion. 
These results indicate that sulfate is the second largest source of varia -
tion in the gradient analysis. Calculated stress-value was 0.05, which 
suggests a relative strong separation of the microbial communities (Paliy 
and Shankar, 2016 ). 
Some members of the family Clostridiaceae and of the genera Lacto -
coccus , Prevotella and Atopobium increased in proportion in the presence 
of the azo dye, while members of Ruminococcaceae and Clostridium sensu 
stricto 1 were negatively affected. Members of Firmicutes predominated 
in all conditions, with relative abundance values of 66–80% (PI), 
53–67% (PII), 72–76% (PIII) and 76–81% (PIV) (Supplementary mate-
rials). This phylum is often favored under acidogenic conditions (Ribeiro et al., 2022 ) and was recently associated with azo-reducing activity in 
the gut microbiota (Zahran et al., 2021 ). 
Fig. 5-A shows the most abundant genera in R1 as a function of 
operational phase. Lactococcus , an homolactic bacteria belonging to 
Firmicutes, increased in proportion from 0.9 to 9.2% (PI) to 16.9%, in 
PII, and up to 26.7% after DB22 loading rate was further increased (PIV). 
In a study conducted by P˘erez-Díaz and McFeeters (2009) , several lactic 
acid bacteria were able to modify an azo dye under anaerobic and even 
aerobic conditions, and therefore Lactococcus is a potential azo degrader. 
Clostridium was also positively selected in the presence of the azo 
dye, accounting for 19.5% of the overall bacterial community in the end 
of the operation (day 328). An anaerobic azoreductase capable of 
reducing high molecular weight sulfonated azo dyes has been recently 
described in a member of Clostridium (Morrison and John, 2015 ), 
meaning that this bacterium might be involved in the biodegradation of 
DB22. 
Prevotella and Atopobium , which have no previous records regarding 
azo decolorization, were also among the genera that were positively 
selected in the presence of DB22. Prevotella can produce acetate from 
glucose (Takahashi and Yamada, 2000 ) and major end-products of 
Atopobium include lactic acid and acetate (Acevedo Monroy and Kizi-
lova, 2006 ; Burton et al., 2004 ). Since acetate formation presented a

7strong correlation with color removal (Section 3.3), these bacteria could 
be involved in decolorization of DB22 via inter-species hydrogen 
transfer. 
On the contrary, samples from R2 rather grouped by either the 
absence (PI and PII) or presence (PIII and PIV) of sulfate ions in the feed 
(Fig. 4-B), suggesting that azo dyes and/or intermediates from reductive 
decolorization had little impact on the bacterial community structure in 
R2. This is likely because microorganisms in R2 were less exposed to the 
dye, since most of the decolorization occurred in R1, which also received 
a higher DB22 load. Nevertheless, these microorganisms were still 
exposed to aromatic amines and other DB22 fragments recalcitrant to 
the AD. 
Syntrophobacter and Desulfovibrio were among the genera that were 
enriched in the presence of sulfate. Syntrophobacter increased in pro-
portion from 0.7 to 1%, in phase PII, to 2.5–5.8% after sulfate was 
introduced into the system (Fig. 5-B). Desulfovibrio increased its relative 
abundance from 0.5 to 1.6 to up to 2.6% under the same conditions. 
Both are sulfate reducers with fermentation ability (Muyzer and Stams, 
2008 ). SRB community in the two-stage AD system will be covered with 
more detail in the next section. 
3.5. Sulfate reducing bacterial (SRB) and methanogenic communities in 
the two-stage AD system 
No sequences of the dsrB and few sequences of the mcrA genes were 
obtained in samples from R1. Indeed, SRB and methanogens were not 
expected in this reactor due the low pH (pH 4.3–4.5). In R2, methano -
genic community presented minor variations during the system ’s oper-
ation (supplementary materials ). Uncultured Methanobacteriales 
archaeon , Methanosaeta concilii GP-6, and Methanosaeta concilii were the 
only taxa enriched in the presence of DB22 (Phases PII, PIII and PIV). 
Members of the order Methanobacteriales generally use H2 CO2 to 
produce methane (Acevedo Monroy and Kizilova, 2006 ), therefore un-
cultured Methanobacteriales archaeon is likely to compete with azo re-
ducers, especially since it accounted for nearly 50% of the methanogenic 
community in R2. Methanosaeta concilii , which comprised up to 20.6% of 
the mcrA sequences in phase PIV, is the only methanogen in R2 capable 
of utilizing acetate as substrate for methanogenesis (Barber et al., 2011 ). 
The increased proportion of hydrogenotrophic methanogens shows that 
production of methane derived primarily from hydrogen and carbon 
dioxide, but competition between azo reducers and hydrogen-utilizing 
methanogens was minimized because bulk color removal occurred in the preceding unit, i.e. R1. 
It is important to point out that R2 was inoculated with sludge from a 
UASB reactor processing wastewater from a poultry slaughterhouse, 
which are enriched with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Ammonia 
released in the biodegradation of protein-rich effluents leads to inhibi -
tion of aceticlastic methanogens and in inversion of the Wood -
–Ljungdahl pathway by SAOB community (Müller et al., 2013 ). DB22 
biodegradation may result in increasing concentrations of ammonia as 
well. Both the source of the inoculum and the presence of DB22 might 
have influenced the predominance of hydrogen-utilizing methanogens. 
SRB community structure in samples from phases PIII and PIV – 
which correspond to the operation with added sulfate – did not present a 
significant shift after the increment in DB22 loading rate (supplemen -
tary materials ). Although Desulfobulbus propionicus demonstrated a large 
increase in proportion in phase PIV (approximately 52%), this enrich -
ment had started in the previous phase, at lower concentrations of the 
azo dye. Desulfobulbus propionicus is capable of oxidizing propionate in 
the presence of sulfate, sulfite or thiosulfate as terminal electron ac-
ceptors (Widdel and Pfennig, 1982 ). Sulfide produced (Reaction 1) can 
be involved in further transformation of DB22 reduction products in R2, 
as well as in additional removal of color, since an increase in the con-
centration of total aromatic amines was observed in this reactor (Oli-
veira et al., 2022 ). This is because chemical reduction of azo bonds by 
sulfide can be expected under sulfidogenic conditions, but the contri -
bution of this mechanism was found to be little compared to biological 
reduction (Van Der Zee et al., 2003 ). Propionate oxidation leads to 
formation of acetate (Reaction 1), and therefore D. propionicus can 
establish syntrophic interactions with Methanosaeta concilii instead of 
competing for acetate.

3.6. Syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacterial (SAOB) and acetogenic 
communities in the two-stage AD system 
Amplicon sequencing targeting the fhs gene was conducted in sam-
ples from the two-stage AD system to investigate the SAOB and aceto -
genic communities. A low diversity of these populations was observed in 
R1, where Leuconostoc mesenteroides predominated in all operational 
phases (62–95%), regardless of the presence of DB22 or sulfate (sup-
plementary materials ). L. mesenteroides is an heterolactic lactic acid 
bacterium (LAB) that produces lactic acid, ethanol and/or acetate as

stage (R2) reactors. Low abundant amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) were removed from the analysis using a 1.5% threshold. J.M.S. Oliveira et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chemosphere 310 (2023) 136731
8main fermentation end-products (Ozcan et al., 2019 ). 
On the other hand, the homolactic LAB Lactococcus lactis was clearly 
selected in the presence of the azo dye, increasing its relative abundance 
from 0 to 2.4% in the stabilization phase to up to 11.5% at 32.5 mg≡L 1 
DB22 (Phases PII and PIII), and further to 16.1% when DB22 concen -
tration was further increased to 65 mg≡L 1 DB22 (Phase PIV). These 
results are compatible with those from the 16 S rRNA gene amplicon 
sequencing analysis (Section 3.4) and suggests that L. lactis is involved in 
reductive decolorization of DB22 through the pathway in Eq. 8 
(Table 2). However, it is not clear whether decolorization mediated by 
L. lactis is a typical co-metabolic reaction carried by redox mediators. 
NADHHproduced in glycolysis is recycled during lactate formation 
from pyruvate, resulting in no net hydrogen production. Other studies 
reported azo dye reduction by L. lactis (You and Teng, 2009 ) and LAB 
(P˘erez-Díaz and McFeeters, 2009 ). We hypothesize that azo dye decol -
orization by L. lactis occurs through the action of enzymes with high 
specificity to azo dyes, since genes encoding the production of the 
enzyme FMN-dependent NADH-azoreductase were found in the genome 
of L. lactis isolated from this same reactor (unpublished data). 
SAOB and acetogenic communities were more diverse in R2 (supplementary materials ). Prevotella melaninogenica was remarkably 
enriched at higher DB22 concentrations (Phase PIV), accounting for up 
to 41.1% of the fhs sequences. This bacterium is able to produce acetic 
and succinic acids as primary end products of glucose or lactose 
fermentation (Shah and Gharbia, 1992 ). On the other hand, Sporolituus 
thermophilus (Ogg and Patel, 2009 ), which utilizes both malate and cit-
rate, decreased in proportion throughout R2 operation, particularly 
under sulfidogenic conditions (Phases PIII and PIV). Probably, this 
apparent drop in the relative abundance is rather a consequence of the 
enrichment of P. melaninogenica . 
Brachybacterium phenoliresistens presented an increasing pattern in its 
relative abundance values as from phase PIII, i.e. after sulfate addition. 
This specie can degrade hydrocarbons under high salinity conditions 
and have been isolated from oil-contaminated sites (Chou et al., 2007 ; 
Wang et al., 2014 ). The ability to survive in saline environments explain 
the enrichment of this bacterium after exposure to sulfate. Moreover, the 
proportion of B. phenoliresistens further increased to 12.4% when higher 
DB22 concentrations were loaded into the system, which can be 
attributed to the ability of this species to tolerate high levels of phenol 
and degrade hydrocarbons. DB22 was converted to aromatic compounds

Oliveira et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Chemosphere 310 (2023) 136731
9in the preceding unit, which could not be further mineralized, but were 
transformed in R2 (Oliveira et al., 2022 ). This means that 
B. phenoliresistens could be involved in the transformation of hydrocar -
bons in R2. 
4.Conclusion 
Azo dye decolorization in the two-stage AD system occurs mainly as a 
result of hydrogen-producing reactions (in the form of H2 and/or 
reduced cofactors) in a mechanism mediated by electron shuttles. En-
zymes with high specificity (e.g. azoreductases from L. lactis) seems to 
play an important role as well. Acidogens from R1 were observed to be 
sensitive and undergo selection upon exposure to azo dyes, whereas 
microbial communities in R2 are exposed to lower levels of azo dye and 
therefore appear less sensitive. These results are relevant when consid -
ering organic matter and sulfate removals and biogas production in R2, 
as methanogens and SRB show less impact under these circumstances.
