We have discovered that cells of Bacillus subtilis at the mid-exponential phase of growth are a mixed
population of two strikingly different cell types. One type is single swimming cells (or cell doublets) in which
the transcription factor for motility, /H9268D, is active (/H9268DON). The other type is long chains of sessile cells in
which /H9268Dis inactive (/H9268DOFF). The population is strongly biased toward /H9268D-ON cells by the action of a novel
regulatory protein called SwrA. SwrA stimulates the transcription of a large operon (the flagellum/chemotaxisoperon), which includes the genes for /H9268
Dand an activator of /H9268D-directed gene expression, SwrB. Cell
population heterogeneity could enable B. subtilis to exploit its present location through the production of
sessile cells as well as to explore new environmental niches through the generation of nomadic cells.

Microbiologists have traditionally viewed populations of
genetically identical bacteria as if they were homoge-neous. Increasingly, however, it has become apparentthat under certain conditions certain populations of bac-teria are heterogeneous, consisting of mixtures of cells indecidedly distinct physiological or developmental states.For example, Escherichia coli cells can spontaneously
enter a “persister” state in which some cells in the popu-lation temporarily stop growing and, as a consequence,escape the killing action of /H9252-lactam antibiotics (Balaban
et al. 2004; Keren et al. 2004). Similarly, under condi-tions of nutrient limitation, cells of Bacillus subtilis
generate a mixed population in which about half of thecells activate the master regulator for sporulation,Spo0A, and the remainder do not (Chung et al. 1994;González-Pastor et al. 2003; Fujita et al. 2005). The bio-logical significance of this example of population hetero-geneity is that cells that have activated Spo0A delay be-coming committed to spore formation by a process ofcannibalism that involves the killing of sibling cells thathave not activated the master regulator (González-Pastoret al. 2003)
Yet another example of population heterogeneity is
seen during the transition to stationary phase under con-ditions in which cells of B. subtilis enter a physiological
state known as genetic competence. Competent cellscease growth and become capable of undergoing DNA-mediated transformation. During the transition to sta-tionary phase, only some cells in the population (10%–20%) activate the master regulator for competence,ComK, and become competent (Hadden and Nester1968; Haseltine-Cahn and Fox 1968; Haijema et al.2001). In this manner only a fraction of the cells sacrificetheir ability to grow in order to gain the benefit of DNAuptake. The remainder of the cells can continue to growor alternatively respond to stationary phase in otherways such as the process of sporulation mentionedabove.
Here we report the discovery of a new and striking
example of cell population heterogeneity that is seenduring the exponential phase of growth. We show thatgrowing cells of B. subtilis exist in one of two states with
respect to the expression of genes involved in motility.Cells of B. subtilis swim by means of a flagellum, the
protein components of which are partly encoded by alarge (31-gene-long) operon (the fla/che operon) that in-
cludes flagellum genes, genes involved in chemotaxis,and the gene for the alternative sigma factor /H9268
D, the pen-
ultimate member of the operon (Fig. 1; Helmann et al.1988; Márquez et al. 1990; Zuberi et al. 1990; Albertini etal. 1991). The /H9268
Dfactor, in turn, directs the transcription
of the remaining genes involved in flagellum biosynthe-sis, which lie outside the operon. These include hag, the
structural gene for the flagellar filament, and flgG and
flgK, which encode major components of the flagellarhook–basal body (Mirel and Chamberlin 1989; Chen andHelmann 1994; Mirel et al. 1994; Serizawa et al. 2004).The/H9268
Dfactor also directs the transcription of genes
(lytC, lytD, and lytF) for autolytic enzymes that mediate3Corresponding author.

We now show that growing cells of B. subtilis are a
mixed population in which /H9268
Dis active (ON) in some
cells and inactive (OFF) in other cells. When /H9268Dis ON,
individual cells are motile, whereas when /H9268Dis OFF,
cells grow as long sessile chains. We show that the popu-lation is strongly biased toward swimming cells by anovel regulatory protein called SwrA that stimulates thetranscription of the fla/che operon, which includes the
gene for /H9268
Dand the gene for a novel protein called SwrB
(Fig. 1). We further show that SwrB is an activator of/H9268
D-directed gene expression and that biasing the cell
population to the /H9268D-ON state requires high-level ex-
pression of the genes for both /H9268Dand SwrB. Finally, we
speculate on the nature of the mechanism that switches/H9268
Dactivity ON or OFF and the biological significance of
the alternative cell types.
Results
Growing cells exist in two alternative developmental
states
Laboratory strains of B. subtilis, such as 168 and PY79,
are traditionally recognized as existing in one of two
morphologically distinct forms (Fein 1979). One form ischaracterized by long chains of sessile cells, and this isthe predominant form seen during the exponential phaseof growth, as illustrated in Figure 2A. The other form isrepresented by single cells or cell doublets that are mo-tile. Motile cells represent a small proportion of thepopulation during growth but are known to becomeprevalent during the transition to stationary phase(Nishihara and Freese 1975).
While studying the wild B. subtilis strain 3610, we
noticed that the relative proportion of the two cell formswas dramatically different from that of the laboratorystrains. Instead of long chains of sessile cells, we princi-pally saw motile cells that were present as single cells orpairs (Fig. 2B). It is thought that the wild strain 3610 is anancestor to the laboratory strain PY79 and that duringdomestication various multicellular behaviors, such asthe capacity to form architecturally complex communi-ties of cells (biofilms) and to form rafts of swarming cellson surfaces, were lost (Branda et al. 2001; Kearns andLosick 2003). It now seems that the two strains also dif-fer with respect to their cell population biases betweenthe states of swimming and chaining.
Cell chaining and motility are controlled by the alter-
native sigma factor /H9268
D, which governs motility and the
production of autolysins involved in cell separation (Hel-mann et al. 1988; Márquez et al. 1990; Blackman et al.1998; Serizawa et al. 2004). We therefore wonderedwhether the difference between the long chains of sessilecells and the motile cells was reflected in the activity of/H9268
D. To monitor /H9268D-directed gene transcription, we cre-
ated a reporter construct (Phag–gfp) in which the gene for
the green fluorescent protein was fused to a strong pro-moter (P
hag) for a gene (hag) under /H9268Dcontrol (Mirel and
Chamberlin 1989). Indeed, the two cell types differedsharply with respect to the activity of the alternative /H9268
factor. Whereas single cells and cell doublets werebrightly fluorescent, little fluorescence was detected inthe cell chains. This was true both for the laboratorystrain (Fig. 3A), where cell chains were the predominantform, and for the wild strain (Fig. 3B), where motile cellswere the predominant form. As a control, cells mutantfor/H9268
Dgrew almost exclusively as long chains and failed
to express the Phag–gfp reporter (Figs. 2K, 3K). We con-
clude that sessile cells and motile cells represent alter-native developmental states that coexist during the ex-ponential phase of growth and differ with respect to /H9268
D-
directed gene transcription.
SwrA biases cells to the swimming state
Next, we wanted to determine the basis for the striking
difference between wild and laboratory strains in theproportions of cells in the two developmental states.Laboratory strains typically carry a frameshift mutationinswrA, a gene of unknown function that is required for
swarming motility (Kearns et al. 2004; also referred to asswrAA, Calvio et al. 2005). We therefore wonderedwhether SwrA was responsible for the high bias towardmotile cells in the 3610 wild strain. Indeed, the intro-duction of a swrA mutation into 3610 caused a dramatic

3084 GENES & DEVELOPMENT Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on August 28, 2024 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.org Downloaded from increase in the proportion of cells in the sessile, chaining
state (Fig. 2C). Moreover, cell chains from the swrA mu-
tant derivative of 3610 exhibited only a low level of ex-pression from the P
hag–gfp reporter (Fig. 3C). Thus, the
introduction of a swrA mutation had caused the other-
wise wild strain to closely resemble the laboratory strainPY79 both with respect to cell chaining and /H9268
Dactivity.
As a control, a reporter construct (Phy-spankC–gfp), in
which the gene for the green fluorescent protein wasfused to a promoter (P
hy-spankC) that is constitutive and
under the control of /H9268A, was introduced into the swrA
mutant derivative of 3610. Figure 3L shows that theP
hy-spankC–gfp construct was expressed at similar levels
in single cells and in cell chains. Thus, the block in /H9268D-
directed gene transcription did not reflect a general de-fect in gene expression or a limitation in the capacity todetect green fluorescence in cell chains.
Finally, as evidence that the population bias was a fea-
ture of cells in the exponential phase of growth, similarresults were obtained at early (OD
600< 0.3) and late
(OD600= 1.0) stages of the exponential phase of growth,
and this was true both in the case of the wild type and inthe case of the swrA mutant (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Also, to ensure that cells were truly in the exponentialphase of growth, the cultures of the experiment ofSupplementary Figure S1 were inoculated by a 20-folddilution from cell cultures that were themselves at themid-exponential phase of growth.
We conclude that B. subtilis exists in two alternative
developmental states during the exponential phase ofgrowth. The two states are governed by the activity of/H9268
D, being either ON or OFF. Cells in which /H9268Dactivity
is ON express autolysin and flagellum biosynthesisgenes and are characterized by being motile and under-going cell separation. Cells in which /H9268
Dactivity is OFFfail to express these genes and grow as long, nonmotilechains. SwrA biases population heterogeneity in the di-rection of cells in which /H9268
Dactivity is ON. Thus, in the
absence of SwrA, the cells are chiefly in the /H9268D-OFF
state, whereas in the presence of SwrA, cells are princi-pally in the /H9268
D-ON state.
Overexpression of swrA eliminates the lag
in the transition to swarming
To investigate further the role of swrA in cell chaining,
a strain was constructed in which swrA was overex-
pressed as a consequence of being fused to a strong, /H9268A-
recognized promoter (Phy-spank ). In contrast to the pre-
dominance of chains observed for the swrA mutant and
the preponderance of swimming cells observed for
strains that were wild type for swrA, a strain in which
swrA was overexpressed generated few, if any, chains
(Fig. 2D). Instead, the population consisted almost en-tirely of single, swimming cells that uniformly exhibiteda high level of /H9268
D-directed gene transcription (Fig. 3D). In
addition, overexpression of swrA resulted in a striking
overproduction of flagella (Fig. 4).
During swarming motility, B. subtilis cells become
hyperflagellated, resembling cells in which swrA has
been overexpressed (Kearns and Losick 2003; Senesi et al.2004). To test the consequences of varying SwrA levelson swarming motility, the overexpression construct de-scribed above in which swrA expression is under the
control of an IPTG-inducible promoter, was introducedinto a swrA mutant background, and the levels of swrA
expression were varied by adjusting the amount of in-ducer (IPTG) present in the liquid growth medium priorto transferring the cells to solid medium. Consistentwith the fact that swrA is required for swarming, the

chains of four or more individuals were enu-merated and categorized as “chains.” Finally,
the number of cells in singlets and doubletsand the number of cells in chains were di-vided by the total number of cells and con-verted into a percentage. At least 800 cellswere counted for each strain.B. subtilis heterogeneity during growth

on swarm agar plates in the absence of inducer (Fig. 5A).However, when grown in liquid medium fortified withIPTG, the ability of the cells to swarm when subse-quently tested on solid medium was found to have beenrestored (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, whereas swarming inwild-type cells is preceded by a lag period that is depen-dent on the number of cells used in the inoculum(Kearns and Losick 2003; Shimada et al. 2004), theswarming lag of DS526 was found to be dependent on theIPTG concentration. Indeed, at the highest levels of in-ducer, the swarming lag was completely abolished (Fig.5A). Based on the observation that overexpression ofswrA both abolishes the swarming lag and causes hyper-
flagellation, it seems possible that high levels of SwrAbypass both the cell density and surface requirements forentry into the swarming state and produce differentiated“swarm cells” in liquid medium.
A suppressor mutation bypasses the role of SwrAin swimming and swarming
To investigate the mechanism by which SwrA acts, we
looked for extragenic suppressors of the swarming defectin SwrA mutants. To do so, we took advantage of therequirement for swrA in surface motility to select for
mutants that had acquired the capacity to swarm in thepresence of a null mutation of the gene. When a swrA-
null mutant was inoculated in the center of a swarm agarplate, the cells initially grew as a tight central colony andfailed to completely colonize the surface of the plate.However, after 48 h, flares of cells that had regained theability to swarm emerged from the central colony. Cellsfrom four independently isolated suppressor mutantswere clonally purified.
The results obtained with one such suppressor of swrA
(soa) mutant were as follows. The mutant exhibited aphenotype that resembled that observed when swrA was
overexpressed: The suppressor mutant swarmed withouta lag (Fig. 5B), grew predominantly as single motile cells(Fig. 2E), and was hyperflagellated in liquid medium(Fig. 4), and /H9268
D-directed gene transcription was uniform
among cells in the population (Fig. 3E). That the soa
suppressor mutant retained the original swrA-null mu-
tation was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction(PCR) analysis.
The soa suppressor mutation was found to reside
within the promoter region (P
fla/che ) upstream of a large

cated to flagellum biosynthesis and chemotaxis (Fig. 1;
Márquez-Magaña and Chamberlin 1994; Kearns et al.
2004; Werhane et al. 2004). The region upstream of thefla/che operon contains two promoters: an operon-proxi-
mal promoter that is transcribed by /H9268
A-containing RNA
polymerase (herein called Pfla/che(A) ), and an operon distal
promoter that is transcribed by /H9268D-containing RNA
polymerase (herein called Pfla/che(D) ) (Fig. 1; Estacio et al.
1998; West et al. 2000). The Pfla/che(A) promoter contains
an imperfect −10 sequence (TAcAAT), and the soasup-
pressor mutant was found to contain a single base-pairchange that created a −10 sequence that perfectly con-formed to the consensus (TATAAT).
We predicted that the consequence of the soamuta-
tion was to increase promoter strength. To test this hy-pothesis, reporter constructs were generated by fusingthe promoter region from either the wild type or soa
mutant to the lacZ gene, which encodes /H9252-galactosidase.
The promoter from the soamutant produced twice as
much /H9252-galactosidase activity as did the wild type (data
not shown). That increased promoter activity was suffi-cient to bypass swrA was confirmed by introducing a
P
hy-spank promoter immediately upstream of the fla/che
operon in a swrA mutant background. Enhanced expres-
sion of the fla/che operon was sufficient to restore
swarming motility to the swrA mutant, and, as with the
suppressor mutant, the swarming lag was abolished (Fig.5B). From these data, we conclude that soais a promoter
up-mutation.
The remaining three suppressor-of-swrA mutations
were also found to be located within or immediately up-stream of the P
fla/che promoter region. One was identical
to the base-pair change in the Pfla/che(A) promoter de-
scribed above. The second was a deletion of the 3 /H11032-region
of the gene (codY) immediately upstream of the fla/che
operon and its rho-independent transcriptional termina-tor. A similar deletion has been shown to increase ex-pression of the fla/che operon by readthrough from up-
stream transcription (Amati et al. 2004). The final sup-pressor was also a large deletion spanning codY and
likely the transcriptional terminator, but the preciseboundaries of the deletion were not determined. Thus allfour suppressor mutations support the conclusion thatincreased expression of the fla/che operon is sufficient to
bypass the requirement for swrA.
Next, we investigated whether the /H9268
A-directed
Pfla/che(A) promoter was the target of SwrA. To do this,
Pfla/che(A) (which had been separated from Pfla/che(D) ) was
fused to lacZ and introduced into the chromosome at the
amyE locus. Expression of the Pfla/che(A) –lacZ fusion was
found to be threefold lower in a strain mutant for swrA
and ∼50% higher when swrA was overexpressed using
the Phy-spank –swrA contruct (which had been inserted
into the chromosome at the thrC locus) (Fig. 6B; Supple-
mentary Table S1). The effect on the Pfla/che(A) promoter
was specific as judged by the fact that SwrA did not en-

We conclude that SwrA acts as a positive regulator of thefla/che operon by stimulating transcription from the
P
fla/che(A) promoter.
SwrA and SigD direct the transcription of partiallyoverlapping sets of genes
To compare the patterns of SwrA- and /H9268
D-directed gene
transcription on a genome-wide basis, we carried out two
kinds of transcriptional profiling experiments. In one,RNA from mid-exponential-phase cells of a swrA mu-
tant was compared with RNA from mid-exponential-phase cells in which swrA was overexpressed. In the
other, RNA from mid-exponential-phase cells of a sigD
mutant was compared with RNA from mid-exponential-phase cells in which sigD was overexpressed. The results
show that the patterns of SwrA- and /H9268
D-activated tran-
scription overlapped extensively in that SwrA stimu-lated the expression of many of the members of the /H9268
D
regulon (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2). That SwrAstimulates transcription of /H9268
D-controlled genes was con-
firmed by the use of lacZ fusions to four promoters
(Phag,PyvyF,PflgM, and PlytA) known to be under the di-
rect control of the alternative /H9268factor (Fig. 6; Mirel and
Chamberlin 1989; Lazarevic et al. 1992; Mirel et al. 1994;Estacio et al. 1998).
A simple explanation for these results is that SwrA
stimulates transcription from P
fla/che(A) and thereby in-
directly enhances /H9268D-directed transcription by promot-
ing transcription through sigD, which is the penultimate
gene in the fla/che operon (Fig. 1). Despite the presence
of the Pfla/che(D) promoter, transcription of the fla/che
operon was only weakly enhanced by /H9268D, not meeting
the 2.5-fold threshold of significance set in our microar-ray experiments. However, this result was not unex-pected as P
fla/che(D) is much weaker than Pfla/che(A) and
was known from earlier work to make only a minor con-tribution to transcription of the fla/che operon (West et
al. 2000). This was confirmed in our present inves-tigation by the use of a P
fla/che(D) –lacZ fusion, which
generated 88 Miller units of activity, as compared to aP
fla/che(A) –lacZ fusion, which generated 515 Miller units
of activity (Supplementary Table S1).
As the overexpression of swrA stimulates the expres-
sion of sigD, we wondered whether the overexpression of
sigD alone would be sufficient to bias the population in
the direction of /H9268D-ON cells. Unlike the case for swrA
overexpression in which Phag–gfp was uniformly ex-
pressed in almost all cells in the population (Fig. 3D),overexpression of sigD was not sufficient to produce a
uniform population of cells in the /H9268
D-ON state (Figs. 2F,
3F). From this we conclude that an additional gene(s)under SwrA control contributes to biasing cells to the/H9268
D-ON state. Genes within the fla/che operon were
likely candidates as the soasuppressor up-regulated the
expression of this operon and strongly biased the popu-lation to the /H9268
D-ON state.SwrB also contributes to /H9268D-directed gene expression
In previous work we identified a gene called swrB that is
required for swarming but not swimming motility(Kearns et al. 2004). The swrB gene is located immedi-
ately downstream of, and is contranscribed with, sigD in
thefla/che operon (Fig. 1; Werhane et al. 2004). In light of
our results with SwrA, we wondered whether SwrBmight also contribute to /H9268
D-directed gene expression
during growth. To answer this question, we monitored/H9268
D-directed gene expression using both the Phag–gfp fu-
sion/reporter and a /H9268D-dependent lacZ reporter. In the
absence of SwrB, we observed only a slight reduction inthe number of cells in the population in which /H9268
Dwas
active and there was a slight decrease in overall /H9268Dac-
tivity (Figs. 2G, 3G; Supplementary Table S1). Strikingly,however, /H9268
Dactivity was almost completely abolished
in cells that were doubly mutant for SwrA and SwrB(Figs. 2H, 3H; Supplementary Table S1). Unlike the swrA
mutation, the swrB mutation did not affect expression
from the P
fla/che(A) promoter (Supplementary Table S1).
Evidently, SwrB does contribute to /H9268D-directed gene ex-
pression, but the contribution of SwrB is chiefly maskedby the contribution of SwrA.
The simplest interpretation of these results is that
SwrB is largely dispensable for /H9268
D-directed gene expres-
sion under conditions in which /H9268Dis abundant due to
high levels of sigD transcription. However, under condi-
tions in which SwrA is absent and therefore /H9268Dlevels are
low, SwrB plays a critical role in /H9268D-directed gene ex-
pression. In keeping with this interpretation, the soapro-
moter up-mutation, which bypasses the dependence ofthe P
fla/che(A) promoter on SwrA, restored /H9268D-directed
gene expression to a swrA swrB double mutant (Figs. 2I,
3I). In this case, the soamutation allowed sigD (and the
rest of the fla/che operon) to be transcribed at a high
level in the absence of SwrA, which is consistent withthe hypothesis that at high levels of /H9268
D, the role of SwrB
in/H9268D-directed gene expression is dispensable.
Biasing cell population heterogeneity requires SwrB
As noted above, overexpressing swrA or bypassing swrA
by means of a promoter up-mutation (soa) suppressed

D-ON state (Fig. 3D). Yet, over-
expressing sigD alone (by use of the Phy-spank –sigD con-
struct) failed to do so (Fig. 3F). Evidently, suppressing cellpopulation heterogeneity requires enhanced transcrip-tion not only of sigD but also of an additional gene(s) in
thefla/che operon. An appealing candidate for this gene
isswrB,a sswrB lies immediately downstream of, and is
cotranscribed with, sigD, and hence SwrA and soawould
be expected to enhance its transcription as well. In sup-port of this hypothesis, the promoter up-mutation soa
was unable to generate a largely homogeneous popula-tion of /H9268
D-ON cells when the fla/che operon was mutant
forswrB (Figs. 2I, 3I). We conclude that driving the popu-
lation in the direction of /H9268D-ON cells requires high lev-
els of both /H9268Dand of its activator, SwrB. Simultaneous

GENES & DEVELOPMENT 3089 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on August 28, 2024 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.org Downloaded from sufficient to suppress cell population heterogeneity (data
not shown). We conclude from this that driving the cellpopulation in the direction of /H9268
D-ON cells requires over-
expression of an additional yet-to-be-identified gene(s) inthefla/che operon.
Discussion
Cell population heterogeneity is governed by a biased
bistable switch
We have discovered that individual growing cells of B.
subtilis exist in two strikingly different states: a no-
madic state in which the cells are motile and in which
/H9268
Dis active (/H9268DON) and a sessile state in which the cells
are attached to each other in long chains and in which /H9268D
is inactive (/H9268DOFF). In this way, B. subtilis appears to
resemble the unrelated, dimorphic bacterium Caulobac-
ter crescentus, which grows as morphologically andphysiologically distinct motile and sessile cells. Theability to generate a mixed population of sessile and no-madic cells may confer on B. subtilis (and Caulobacter)
the capacity both to exploit its present location as wellas to disperse to new and perhaps more favorable niches.
InCaulobacter the generation of alternative cell types
is hard-wired into the cell cycle (Skerker and Laub 2004).This is not the case in B. subtilis, and we propose instead
that the formation of motile and sessile cell types by B.
subtilis is mediated by a bistable switch that locks the
activity of /H9268
Dinto an ON or OFF state (Ferrell 2002). In
wild (undomesticated) strains, the switch is biased in thedirection of the /H9268
D-ON state by SwrA, a regulatory pro-
tein that stimulates expression of sigD by directly or
indirectly enhancing transcription from the /H9268A-con-
trolled, Pfla/che(A) promoter of the fla/che operon. Inter-
estingly, SwrA lacks the hallmark features of many tran-scriptional activator proteins, such as a recognizableDNA-binding motif, and its mode of action in stimulat-ing transcription from the P
fla/che(A) promoter is un-
known. The discovery that SwrA enhances expression ofthefla/che operon and biases cells to the /H9268
D-ON state
also provides insight into its role in surface motility bysuggesting that entry into the swarming state requiresthat a high proportion of the cell population is motileand hyperflagellated.
Consistent with its role in stimulating transcription of
thefla/che operon and biasing the bistable switch, the
gene for SwrA was recently shown to be the site of aclassic mutation called ifm(for increased frequency of
motility) that enhances the abundance (frequency) ofmotile cells and the number of flagella per cell (Grantand Simon 1969; Senesi et al. 2004). Laboratory strainstypically carry a frameshift mutation in swrA (Kearns et
al. 2004), and ifmwas shown to be a single base-pair
deletion that eliminated the frameshift (Calvio et al.2005). Thus, ifmcan now be understood as a reversion
mutation that restored the mutant gene for SwrA inlaboratory strains to its wild-type state.
Interestingly, overexpression of swrA can drive cell
population heterogeneity almost exclusively in the di-rection of the /H9268
D-ON state during growth in liquid me-dium and eliminate the characteristic lag associatedwith differentiation into the swarming state under con-ditions of growth on a surface. To do so, however, SwrAmust stimulate the expression not only of sigD but also
that of an additional gene in the fla/che operon, swrB,
which is ordinarily required for swarming but not swim-ming. Our present results show that SwrB acts by en-hancing /H9268
D-directed gene expression. Like SwrA, SwrB
does not resemble other proteins in the databases, and itsmode of action in augmenting /H9268
Dactivity, and whether
it does so in a direct or indirect fashion, are unknown.
Werhane et al. (2004) have reported that a swrB (ylxL)
mutation alone caused a severe reduction in /H9268D-directed
gene expression (in contrast to the subtle effect we ob-served) but oddly only a modest defect in motility. Thiswork was, however, conducted with a laboratory strainin which the allelic state of swrA was not assessed. As
noted above, laboratory strains frequently contain aframeshift mutation in swrA that reverts at high fre-
quency (Kearns et al. 2004; Calvio et al. 2005). Thus, thestrong dependence of /H9268
D-directed gene expression on
swrB observed by Werhane et al. (2004) may have been
seen with cells that were mutant for swrA. Likewise, the
swimming behavior seen by the authors might have re-sulted from selection under conditions that favor swim-ming for swrA
+revertants. In any event, our results agree
with those of Werhane et al. (2004) in pointing to a rolefor SwrB in the activation of /H9268
D.
A regulatory chain model for the contribution of SwrAand SwrB to gene expression
In summary, we propose a simple regulatory chain for the
contribution of SwrA and SwrB to the expression of genesinvolved in flagellum biosynthesis and motility (Fig. 1).SwrA stimulates the transcription of the fla/che operon
from the P
fla/che(A) promoter, thereby enhancing the tran-
scription of the sigD andswrB genes. The /H9268Dfactor, in
turn, augmented by the action of SwrB, directs transcrip-tion of autolysin genes and the remaining genes involvedin motility. Neither SwrA nor SwrB alone is needed for /H9268
D
activation or motility, but SwrA is required for driving ahigh proportion of the cell population into the /H9268
D-ON
state, and both SwrA and SwrB are needed to achieve thehigh level of flagellation required for surface motility.
Bistability does not depend on SwrA and SwrB and is
not mediated by autogenous regulation
Despite the contributions of SwrA and SwrB to /H9268
Dsyn-
thesis and activity, neither is an essential part of the
mechanism that subjects /H9268D-directed gene expression to
bistability. Thus, cells lacking SwrA and SwrB, whichare normally devoid of /H9268
Dactivity, regained the capacity
to swim and express /H9268D-controlled genes when high-
level transcription of the fla/che operon was restored by
the presence of the soapromoter up-mutation. Yet, soa-
harboring cells that were doubly mutant for SwrA andSwrB exhibited bistability, generating a mixture of single,swimming cells in which /H9268
Dactivity was ON and sessile
chains of cells in which /H9268Dactivity was OFF (Fig. 3I).Kearns and Losick
3090 GENES & DEVELOPMENT Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press  on August 28, 2024 - Published by genesdev.cshlp.org Downloaded from A distinctive feature of the bistable switch governing
/H9268Dactivity is that it is manifest during the exponential
phase of growth. Two other examples of bistable
switches in B. subtilis, those governing the activation of
the master regulators for competence (ComK) (Maamarand Dubnau 2005; Smits et al. 2005) and sporulation(Spo0A) (Veening et al. 2005), operate under conditionsin which cells are entering stationary phase. In contrast,cell population heterogeneity with respect to the state of/H9268
Dactivity was seen under (presumably) steady-state
conditions in which all cells in the population were ac-tively growing.
The bistable switch for /H9268
Dalso differs from those for
ComK and Spo0A in that it does not appear to operate bymeans of autogenous regulation. Compelling evidenceindicates that bistability for the activation of ComK andSpo0A is governed by positive feedback loops in whichthe transcription factors stimulate the expression oftheir own structural genes (directly in the case of formerand indirectly in the case of latter) (Maamar and Dubnau2005; Smits et al. 2005; Veening et al. 2005). This isapparently not the case for /H9268
Das we now explain. First,
although the fla/che operon is preceded by a /H9268D-con-
trolled promoter, Pfla/che(D) is much weaker than the
SwrA-controlled Pfla/che(A) promoter (West et al. 2000;
Supplementary Table S1) and is unlikely to contribute sig-nificantly to the overall level of expression of sigD (and
swrB). Indeed, and as demonstrated by gene microarray ex-periments, overexpression of sigD had little effect on tran-
scription of the fla/che operon (Table 1). Second, it was
previously shown that deletion of P
fla/che(D) has no conse-
quence on motility (West et al. 2000). We have confirmedand extended this observation by building a mutation thatentirely removed P
fla/che(D) (see Supplemental Material)
and found that it had little or no effect on motility or bi-stability (Figs. 2J, 3J). Third, gene microarray experimentsfailed to reveal evidence for any other /H9268
D-controlled pro-
moter in the operon driving expression of sigD (and swrB)
(data not shown). Evidently, then, bistability does not oc-cur by an autogenous control mechanism in which /H9268
D
stimulates transcription of its own structural gene.
A hook–basal body model for bistability
What then is the basis for the bistable switch if, as we
surmise, bistability occurs at a step downstream of thetranscription of the sigD gene? One possibility is that the
switch operates at the level of the synthesis or activity of/H9268
Dby a positive feedback loop involving the assembly of
the flagellum basal body. It is known from work withSalmonella that the activity of the /H9268factor for flagellum
biosynthesis (called /H9268
Fin Gram-negative bacteria) is de-
pendent on the assembly of the flagellum basal body bya pathway involving the anti-sigma factor FlgM (Komeda1986; Hughes et al. 1993; Kutsukake 1994; Karlinsey etal. 2000). We speculate that an analogous pathway (in-deed, possibly involving the B. subtilis homolog of FlgM,
which is known to be an antagonist of /H9268
D) (Caramori et
al. 1996) sets up a self-reinforcing cycle that stimulatesthe synthesis and/or activity of /H9268
D. Many of the genes forthe basal body (those in the fla/che operon) are not under
/H9268Dcontrol, but two major hook–basal body genes, flgG
andflgK, lie outside of the operon and are transcribed in
a/H9268D-dependent manner as judged by gene microarray
analysis (Fig. 1; Table 1; Zuberi et al. 1991; Kubori et al.1997; Serizawa et al. 2004). Thus, /H9268
D-directed transcrip-
tion of flgG andflgK would stimulate basal body forma-
tion, which, in turn, would stimulate the synthesis and/or activity of /H9268
D. We note that suppression of bistability
required overexpression not only of the genes for /H9268Dand
SwrB but also of additional unidentified gene(s) in thefla/che operon. We speculate that this additional gene(s)
could be one or more of the other hook–basal body genesnear the 5/H11032-end of the fla/che operon (Fig. 1). Finally, the
higher-order assembly of the basal body would introducecooperativity into the bistable switch, thereby helping toachieve sharp ON/OFF control of /H9268
Dactivity.
In addition to the bistable switch, /H9268Dactivation is sub-
ject to a phase-variation control mechanism. As we haveseen, the bistable switch is strongly biased by the action ofthe product of swrA, which is subject to a phase-variation
switch that is thought to operate by means of “slipped
strand” mispairing during replication (Henderson et al.
1999; Kearns et al. 2004). Thus, the capacity to exist inalternative motile and sessile life styles is subject to twolevels of stochastic control, a high-frequency bistable (andpresumably epigenetic) switch that ensures that the popu-lation is a mixture of two cell types and a low-frequencyphase variation (genetic) switch that biases the proportionof the two cell types in one direction or the other.
Lastly, we speculate that the population bias between
swimming and chaining cells may be influenced by en-vironmental conditions. Under some conditions, wildstrains of B. subtilis are capable of swarming in a robust
manner on surfaces, a behavior that involves the forma-tion of groups of motile cells that are joined together inassemblies called rafts. Here we have demonstrated thatSwrA biases the population in favor of motile cells,which, in turn, contribute to raft formation and swarm-ing motility. Under other conditions, wild strains arecapable of forming architecturally complex communi-ties (biofilms) in which long chains of nonmotile cellsare tightly bundled together through the formation of anextracellular matrix (Branda et al. 2001, 2004; Kearns etal. 2005). It will be interesting to determine whethersome proteins required for biofilm formation serve tobias the cell population in favor of chaining. Opposingmechanisms that increase the proportion of swimmingcells or chaining cells may be of central importance indetermining which multicellular behavior, swarming orbiofilm formation, is adopted for a particular environment.

Microscopy
For phase contrast images, cells were grown to 1 OD
600, and 5
µL of culture was spotted on a glass microscope slide and im-
mobilized with a poly-L-lysine-treated glass coverslip. Sampleswere observed under phase contrast at 1000× magnification us-
ing an Olympus BX60 microscope and recorded with Meta-morph image capture software (Universal Imaging).
For fluorescence microscopy, 1.0 mL of broth culture was har-
vested at 1.0 OD
600, and washed twice in 1.0 mL of phosphate-
buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4,
a n d2m MK H2PO4), PBS buffer. The suspension was pelleted,
resuspended in 50 µL of PBS buffer containing 1 µg/mL FM4-64(Molecular Probes), and incubated for 5 min at room temperature.Three microliters of suspension were placed on a microscope slideand immobilized with a poly-L-lysine-treated coverslip. Fluores-cence microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX60 micro-scope with Mercury lamp. Fluorescent signals were viewed usingthe phase contrast objective UplanF1 100× and visualized using a
U-WIBA filter cube (GFP, excitation filter 460– 490 nm, barrier
filter 515– 550 nm) or a U-WG filter cube (FM4-64, excitation filter
510– 550 nm, barrier filter >590 nm). Images were captured, false-
colored, and overlaid using Metamorph software, exported as TIFFfiles, and adjusted with Adobe Photoshop software.
Flagella were stained according to Mayfield and Inniss (1977).
Stain was prepared by mixing 10 parts mordant (2 g of tannicacid, 10 mL of 5% phenol, 10 mL of saturated aqueousAlKO
8S2·12 H2O) with 1 part stain (12% crystal violet in etha-
nol). Three microliters of 1.0 OD600broth-grown cells were ap-
plied to a microscope slide and covered with a 22 mm ×40 mm
coverslip. The slide was propped vertically, and 10 µL of dye wasapplied to the top edge of the coverslip to stain the sample bycapillary action. Samples were observed at 1000× magnification
under phase contrast using an Olympus BX60 microscope andrecorded with Metamorph image capture software.
Swarm expansion assay
Cells were grown to mid-log phase at 37° C in LB broth and resus-
pended to 10 OD
600in PBS buffer containing 0.5% India ink (Hig-
gins). Freshly prepared LB containing 0.7% agar (25 mL/plate) was
dried for 30 min in a laminar flow hood, centrally inoculated with10 µL of the cell suspension, dried for another 10 min, and incu-bated at 37° C. The India ink demarked the origin of the colony,
and swarm radii were measured relative to the origin. For consis-tency, an axis was drawn on the back of the plate, and swarm radiimeasurements were taken along this transect.

/H9252-Galactosidase assay
One milliliter of cells were harvested from a mid-log phase
(OD600∼1.0) culture grown in LB broth shaken at 37°C, har-
vested, and resuspended in an equal volume of Z buffer (40 mMNaH
2PO4,6 0m MN a2HPO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 10 mM KCl, 38
mM/H9252-mercaptoethanol). To each sample, lysozyme was add-
ed to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL and incubated at30°C for 15 min. Each sample was diluted appropriately in500 µL of Z buffer and the reaction was started with 100 mL of4 mg/mL 2-nitrophenyl /H9252-D-galactopyranoside (in Z buffer)
and stopped with 250 mL of1MN a
2CO3. The OD420of the
reaction mixtures was recorded, and the /H9252-galactosidase-
specific activity was calculated according to the equation:[OD
420/(time ×OD600)]×dilution factor ×1000.
Transcriptional profiling assay
Total RNA was isolated from mid-exponential-phase cultures
grown in LB broth supplemented with 1 mM IPTG. RNA wasisolated using the hot acid/phenol method (protocol availableat http://mcb.harvard.edu/losick/fawcettpaper/RNAprep.htm).RNA purified from strain DS215 (/H9004swrA/H11019tet) was compared
with strain DS526 (/H9004swrA/H11019tet amyE/H11019P
hy-spank –swrA cat), and
RNA purified from DS323 (/H9004sigD/H11019tet) was compared with
strain DS880 (/H9004sigD/H11019tet amyE/H11019Phy-spank –sigD cat). A total of
20 µg of RNA from each strain was used to apply to the array.The volume of each RNA sample was brought up to 14 µL usingDEPC-treated H
2Oa n d1µ Lo f1m gm L−1of random primer was
added. The samples were incubated at 70°C for 10 min and thenincubated on ice for 2 min. To the appropriate tube, 2 µL of[Cy5]dUTP and [Cy3]dUTP were added along with 12 µL ofreaction mix (2.5× Invitrogen First Strand buffer, 25 mM DTT,
2 mM ATP, 2 mM CTP, 2 mM GTP, 0.8 mM TTP, 100 U ofRoche Protector RNase inhibitor). After addition of [Cy5]dUTPand [Cy3]dUTP, the reactions were shielded from light for therest of the procedure. To the reaction mixture, 200 U of Super-Script II RNase H-free reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) wereadded. The tubes were incubated at room temperature for 10min, then incubated at 42°C for 2 h, and finally incubated at70°C for 15 min. After incubating the reactions, 3 U of RNase H(Invitrogen) was added, and the mixtures were placed at 37°C for20 min. The RNA samples to be compared were combined, anda QIAGEN PCR purification kit was used to purify the cDNAprobes. A Speedvac was then applied to the samples until 5 µLof probe remained. To the remaining probe, 20 µg of yeasttRNA, 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS, and 33% formamide was added. The
reactions were heated to 100°C for 1 min, spun briefly, andapplied to an oligo array containing >99% of the annotated pro-tein-coding genes of the B. subtilis genome (Britton et al. 2002).
Prior to hybridization, the slides were rinsed in rinsing solution(0.2% SDS) for 4 min and washed twice in ddH
2O for 2 min
each. The slides were then blocked for 15 min using aldehydeblocking solution (1.0 g of NaBH
4, 0.75× PBS, 25% ethanol), and
the rinse and washing steps were repeated. The slides were driedbefore applying probe. Hybridizations were performed overnightin CMT-hybridization chambers (Corning) submerged in a wa-terbath at 42°C. After hybridization, unbound probe waswashed off the slides by rinsing for 1 min in wash buffer 1 (2×SSC and 0.2% SDS), 1 min in wash buffer 2 (2× SSC), and 1 min
in wash buffer 3 (0.2× SSC). Finally, the slides were dried and
scanned on a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). Im-ages were processed and analyzed with GenePix 4.0 software(Axon Instruments, Inc.). Spots containing low signals were ex-cluded from further analysis. In our final data set, we includedonly genes in which there was a 2.5-fold change in expression,as seen using data from at least three replicates of the transcrip-tional profiling experiment.
