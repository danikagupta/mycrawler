 ABSTRACT  
The fast pace of economic growth in Kenya has created a large demand for meat pr oducts. This 
stands at an annual average of about 600,000 metric tonnes of red meat which is expected to 
continue rising according to global animal  product consumption trends. Consequent challenges 
in m anagement of  increasing volumes of high strength wastewater  have necessitated ardent 
research into susta inable technologies, for which v ertical flow wetlands offer a promising 
solution . Three month e xperiment ation  conducted at Egerton U niversity , explored the potential 
for use of vertical flow constructed wetlands in removing organic matter from slaughterhouse 
wastewater.  The wastewater used was sourced  from  a mid -scale size slaughterhouse in Njoro 
Township. Experimental design consisted of three tanks of 2 mm sand, 8 mm quarry dust and 16 
mm gravel at shallow 0.65 m and deeper 0.8 m  depth s, each with  four replicates. Retention times 
of 1, 3 and 5 days were also investigated. The t anks were operated batch -wise and e ffluent water 
samples collected five times for each retention time studied . The water samples  were analysed 
soon after using standard  protocols  for BOD 5, COD, NH 4-N and TSS. The untreated slaughter 
house  wastewater characteristics ranged between 28,336 -3,2502 mg/ L for COD, 2,070 -3,653 
mg/L BOD 5,1,371 - 2,160 mg/L TSS and 52.98 -52.42 g/L NH 4-N. The r esults from the 
experimental mesocosm treatment set -up demonstrated that organic matter removal was highest 
at 5 day retention time , with  removals of about 50%, 55% and 82% for BOD 5, COD and TSS 
respectively. Deeper 0.8m mesocosms were noted to have significant  differences in treatment 
for TSS and NH 4-N compared to  shallow 0.65 m  mesocosms . Differences in s ubstrate type were  
observed to hav e no significant effect  on organic matter  removal . In the case of ammonia , 
increase in substrate size was observed to decrease removal efficiency , although s ignific ant 
nitrification did not occur.  NH 4-N was observed to fluctuate with removal efficiency averaging  
at 26.5% . This study demonstrates that vertical flow wetlands operated at longer retention times 
and by  tidal flow pattern facilitate removal of organic matter in slaughter house wastewater . 
However, a  pre-treatment stage is necessary in order to  reduce the organic matter load, and ensure  
lifecycle of the wetland is not threatened.  Targeting ammonia reduction at the pre -treatment stage 
can highly increase the overall treatment efficiency.

 CHAPTER ONE  
INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  Information  
In developing countries, it has been reported that release of untreated wastewater into rivers and 
streams poses a great risk to human and animal health in addition to degrading quality of surface 
and groundwater ( Koech, Ogendi and Kipkemboi, 2012 ). High operational and maintenance costs 
associated with common chemically engineered treatment alternatives for wastewater are 
tremendous and more often than not, overwhelm the local authorities mandated to operate them . 
These challenges have necessitated a search for low cost yet efficient methods of waste water 
treatment for which Constructed Wetland (CW) technologies have shown great potential in east 
Africa (Oketch, A., 2002;  Abira, A., 2008 ; Hunt , Riungu  and Mathiu , 2011; Kimwaga, Mwegoha, 
Mhange, Nyomora and Ligali, 2013 ) 
Verhoeven, Arheimer, Yin and Hefting, (2006) indicated that the use of constructed wetland 
technology can be of particular significance in the conservation of catchments, rivers and lakes 
especially because of their similarity in function to natural wetlands.  As such, they have the added 
benefit of increasing natural habitats.  Morel and Diener, (2006) also pointed out that  CW 
technologies show great promise in inter-alia, reducing the agricultural us e of much needed 
drinking water, reducing cost of water, increasing food securi ty and improving public health . 
Previous studies have established that constructed wetlands can be successfully used in the 
treatment of large scale industrial wastewater  (Bojcevska, H., and Tonderski, K., 2007 ; Al Jawaheri, 
2011; Lavrova and Koumanova, 2013; Chunkao et al. , 2014 ) and domestic waste water (Vymazal, 
2010; Gikas and Tsihrintzis, 2012; Lavrova and Koumanova, 2013). These evidences 
notwithstanding, little inform ation exists on the treatment efficiency of  CW systems in tropical 
regions. In addition, t here are no documented CW systems treating  slaughterhouse wastewater in 
Kenya. Noting further, very few studies exist regarding the application of vertical sub -surfac e flow 
constructed wetlands (VSSFCWs) to meat industry wastewater (Johns, 1995).  This is despite the 
fact that v ertical flow wetland technologies have been proven to efficiently remove high organic 
loads which are a major challenge for slaughterhouse  waste water (Stefanakis and Tsihrintzis, 2012 ; 
Lavrova and Koumanova, 2013, Chunkao and Dumpin, 2015 ). Considering that VSSFWs are also 
smaller than Horizontal Flow systems , they are a cost effective alternative. There is great value 2 
 therefore, in conducting fur ther studies on VSSFWs to fill existing gaps in the ir application on 
abattoir wastewater.  
1.2 Statement of the problem  
The fast pace of economic growth in developing nations like Kenya has created a lar ge demand for 
meat products. A l ivestock revolution attributable to rising incomes and protein based diets has seen 
meat consumption triple in the global south ( Delgado, 2003) . The c onsequent intensification of  meat 
production and animal agriculture to meet this demand is said to be putting significant pres sure on 
freshwater ecosystems (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2012) . Studies by the (World Bank Group, 2007) 
indicate that slaughterhouses  typically  consume between 2.5  m3 to 40 m3 of water per metric tonne 
of meat produced.  Wastewater produced from slaughterhouse  processes is usually a mixture of 
cleaning water of the facility and processing water from slaughtering and cleaning of guts. About 
1200L are used for mid-sclae facility cleaning while 250 L of fresh water is used per carcass . A 
large volume of wastewater  with high organic load is the result.  
Predications by ( Bouwman et al. , 2013)  indicate that this trend will continue to increase steadily 
until 2050. Slaughterhouses have therefore been presented with a unique challenge of managing 
increasing volumes of h igh strength wastewater. In most cases,  raw or partially treated effluent is 
discharged directly into aquatic ecosystems. Occasionally, disposal mechanisms such as exhauster 
services are employed by some facilities. Poor management of slaughter house waste water in 
general poses a very big threat to aquatic life due to the competition for dissolved oxygen created. 
Vertical flow wetlands present an efficient and cost effective solution to organic rich wastewater 
such as those generated from slaughterhouses , but knowledge gaps exist on their design and use in 
slaught erhouse wastewater management.  
1.3 Objectives  
1.3.1 General objective  
To assess the potential use of vertical subsurface flow wetlands in treatment of  slaughterhouse 
wastewater using mesocosm setup .   3 
 1.3.2 Specific objectives  
1. To assess temporal variation  in the physico -chemical characteristics of slaughterhouse 
wastewater over the study period .  
2. To determine the effect of substrate type  and depth on organic matter removal efficiency of 
slaughterhou se wastewater using a mesocosm experimental setup .  
3. To assess the effect of different HRTs on removal efficiency of BOD 5, COD, TSS and NH 4-N.  
1.4 Hypotheses  
H0: There is no significant variation in physico -chemical characteristics of slaughterhouse 
wastew ater over time . 
H0: Differ ences in  substrate type and  depth have  no significant effect on organic matter removal 
efficiency of slaughterhouse wastewater.  
H0: Variation of HRTs does not have a significant influence on removal efficiency of BOD 5, COD, 
TSS and NH 4-N 
1.5 Justification  
Following incidences of poor surface water quality and foul odour in peri -urban areas of Dagoretti, 
Kenya as the results of untreated slaughterhouse wastewater, the National environmental 
Management Authority (NEMA) ordered clos ure of all slaughterhouses discharging raw effluent 
into aquatic receptacles (Kiplagat, 2008). Legal efforts by NEMA, (2006 a and b) compelling large 
water consuming enterprises to recycle their wastewater to set standards before release into the 
environme nt, have necessitated research into cost effective technologies involved in the pre -
treatment of wastewater. Large scale operations without proper pre -treatment facilities for their 
wastewater were forced to shut down or invest in the same (Shiundu and Mwa i, 2008).  
Evidences strongly indicating that VFCWs have the ability to efficiently treat high loads of 
concentrated industrial pollutants such as slaughterhouse wastewater ( WW) may provide a much 
needed solution.  Conversely , their application in East Africa for treatment of slaughterhouse 
wastewater remains low. In the case of Kenya, it is perhaps because of the waste’s bio -chemical 
complexity combined with a scanty knowledge base on system design and operational mechanisms. 
The unpredictable trea tment behaviour of CWs in general further points to existing knowledge gaps 
that hinder optimization of this technology . Also , existing literature elaborates extensively on the 
more popular conventional alternatives for slaughterhouse WW  management. Not to  mention that, 4 
 the largest proportion of studies conducted on slaughterhouse WW  is of temperate regions, hence 
cautioning on replicability of findings to temporal regions.  
The small size requirements and characteristic design and operation aspects which en hance an 
aerobic environment make VFCWs a potentially sustainable technology for high organic matter 
breakdown. This in addition to the limitations mentioned above make it of  great importance to 
advance existing studies on design an d operational factors th at optimize VFCWs’ ability to 
effectively reduce organic load, which happens to be a significant component of slaughterhouse 
WW . 
1.6 Structure of thesis  
Chapter one introduces the study, giving a general perspective of the problem in developing nations 
then narrowing down to specific cases in Kenya. It also highlights the scope of the problem and 
supports significance of the study. The section also highlig hts specific research inquiry and provides 
hypotheses aimed at answering these questions.  
Chapter two  details the general characteristics of slaughterhouse wastewater observed in different 
studies. It also looks at the conventional treatment options used for management of abattoir waste 
and finally narrows down to the specific use of vertical flow wetlands. It described various design 
and operation aspects that are important in achieving high treatment efficiency and also outlines 
removal processes and som e of their affecting factors.  
Chapter three describes the area of study and location of experiment site. The chapter further 
outlines the experimental setup design used, methods of sampling, water collection, laboratory 
analysis and finally the statistical  analyses applied for output generation and presentation.  
Chapter four details results obtained for the study, presented as tables and graphs according to the 
objectives under investigation.  
Chapter five discusses the results and expounds on them in relat ion to past and present studies. It 
highlights similarities and differences of the findings with those of other researches.  
Chapter six concludes on the findings of the study and provides recommendations for further action.

 CHAPTER TWO  
LITERATURE REVIEW  
2. 1 Slaughterhouse wastewater characteristics and production trends  
Common slaughterhouse wastewater characteristics have been documented in various studies as 
having high organic load. The wastewater comprises mostly of proteins, blood, fats, lard, paunc he, 
undigested food and colloidal particles  with high fat, grease and protein content .BOD 5 levels have 
been observed to reaching up to 2000 mg/l ( Irshad, A., Talukder, S., and Selvakumar, K., 2015).  
Slaughterhouse wastewater is usually evaluated as bulk pa rameters due to the specific volumes and 
pollutant loads which may vary greatly for different facilities. Common to many slaughterhouses, 
are considerable amounts of Total phosphorous (TP), Total nitrogen (TN), Total organic carbon 
(TOC), suspended solids,  COD and BOD 5 (Bustillo -Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). A summary of 
the general slaughterhouse WW characteristics is given in Table 1 below.

Table adapted from slaughterhouse wastewater characteristics by (Bustillo -Lecompte et al. , 
2015 ; Irshad et. al., 2015 ). 
Characteristics of effluent wastewater can be assessed in terms of physical, biological and chemical 
components. This preliminary process is essential in informing possible treatment options, design 
of facility, extent of treatment application and even the  general waste management approaches that 6 
 can be adopted for maximum efficiency of resource use within the abattoi r (Irshad et al. , 2015).  In 
addition, knowledge on physico -chemical parameters helps elucidate patterns observed in effluent 
data, due to the strong inter -relationship between physical , chemical  and biological characteristics 
of water. Noting further, t he characteristics of slaughterhouse wastewater such as their temporal 
variability observed  by (Zhao et al. , 2004;  Abdelhakeem, S., Aboulroos, A.  and Kamel, M., 2015) 
where influent concentrations fluctuated irregularly during the experimental period point to the 
importance of determining the extent and impact of influent wastewater quality variation on 
treatment capacity in order to better underst and and manage design and operation processes for high 
treatment results.  
A livestock revolution attributable to rising incomes and protein based diets has seen meat 
consumption triple in the global south. FAO, (2013) stated that from 2002 -2007, annual gl obal beef 
production increased from 14.7 metric tonnes to 10,000  metric tonnes. It is estimated that by 2020 
the current share of meat product consumption in developing countries will rise to 63% from the 
current 52% . A projection of 107 million metric tonnes  more is anticipated, which dwarfs the 
developed countries’ increase by 19 million metric tonnes by 2020.  
The consequent intensification of  meat production and animal agriculture is said to be putting 
significant pressure on freshwater ecosystems (M ekonnen and Hoekstra, 2012) . In Kenya, t he per 
capita consumption of meat has been observed to steadily rise from about 14 kg to 16  kg over the 
last two decades for rural and per i-urban areas, and a slightly higher consumption in urban areas at 
25 kg. This  stands at a national average of about 600,000 metric tonnes of red meat which is 
expected to continue rising according to global animal product consumption trends.   
Studies by the (World Bank Group, 2007) indicate that slaughterhouses  typically  consume be tween 
2.5 m3 to 40 m3 of water per metric tonne of meat produced. These massive volumes have warranted 
classification of meat industries as significant effluent wastewater producers under the global food 
and agriculture sector. Bouwman et al.  (2013) predic ted that this trend will steadily double until 
2050. It is therefore reasonable to presume that volume and strength of wastewater produced will 
follow a similar trend thus requiring an intensified reliance on effective wastewater treatment 
technologies if the world’s freshwater receptacles are to be safeguarded.  
2.2 Current wastewater management technologies in the meat processing industry  
As is common to meat processing industries across the globe, wastewater production and disposal 
are issues of great co ncern , especially if effluent disposal should be practiced sustainably  (FAO, 7 
 2013) . In Europe, many slaughterhouses and rendering plants discharge their wastewater to 
municipal treatment systems after primary treatment. On the other hand, (Brix and Arias, 2005; 
Koech et al. , 2012; Chunkao et al. , 2015) observed that it has been common practice in many parts 
of the world where industries located near waterways dispose of their effluent directly into water 
bodies prior to treatment. The increased  awareness on sustainable development coupled with a need 
for more effective WW treatment technologies has seen a great advancement in slaughterhouse WW 
management. Huge investments have been channelled into automation of slaughtering processes 
and minimal  solid and liquid waste production  (Brix, 1994).  Nevertheless, operational challenges 
unique to each alternative used make it difficult to achieve the latter objective.  
Some of the more popular alternatives currently in use belong to either the aerobic or  anaerobic 
categories. Various treatment methods include Activated Sludge (AS) systems, Bio -trickling filters 
(BTF), Up flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB), Anaerobic digestion (AD), Stabilization ponds 
(SP), Alkaline Hydrolysis (AH), Rotating Bio -Reactor  (RBR), Aerated ponds (AP) and Activated 
Carbon Adsorption (ACA) (Johns, 1995; Al Jawaheri, 2011; Franke -Whittle and Insam, 2013;  
Bustillo -Lecompte and Mehrvar, 2015). Other simpler alternatives include rendering, incineration 
and composting ( Franke -Whittl e and Insam, 2013).  
Anaerobic treatment is mostly used in Europe because of high removal rates of organic 
concentrations present in the WW and generation of small quantities of highly stabilized dewatered 
sludge (Johns, 1995). For instance, both ACA and AS RB are able to achieve between 72% -93% 
removal efficiency for BOD 5 and COD. However, complete degradation of the OM using anaerobic  
technology solely is not achievable. This is because some of the residue effluents usually contain 
solubilized organic matte r that is preferentially aerobically treated ( Irshad et al. , 2015) . However, 
the production of foul odour limits the application of aerobic treatments in tropical regions or during 
the summer season in temperate climates. Nevertheless, both technology type s work best in a 
complementary manner in order to achieve final effluent characteristics that comply with discharge 
limits and standards ( Bustillo -Lecompte,  Mehrvar  and Quiñones -Bolaños,  2013 ; Irshad et al. , 
2015 ). 
It should be noted that little data exists on directly traceable sources of waste and minimization 
strategies used, that allow one to determine the best  and most cost effective a lternatives for 
wastewater management in the meat industry (Johns, 1995). The information on conventional 
technologies presented in this review therefore is meant to give a better viewpoint on the challenges 
faced in dealing with wastewater in meat process ing and as such support investigation into the use 8 
 of constructed wetlands as a sustainable alternative technology for slaughterhouse waste 
management.  
Many studies indicate that the more chemically engineered technologies attract large operation and 
main tenance costs not to mention a great need for skilled operators. These factors reduce both 
attractiveness and longevity of the aforementioned wastewater treatment alternatives and therefore 
more sustainable options are constantly sought after. Furthermore,  Seif and Moursy, (2001) 
established that these conventional treatment processes often do not achieve environmentally 
compliant effluents. In his study, Koech et al.  (2012 ) proposed that existing slaughterhouse facilities 
should be up -scaled to match the q uantities of effluent produced daily. In addition, adoption of 
cleaner meat processing technologies was seen to be a significant step in curbing environmental and 
health risks associated with slaughterhouse waste.  
Organic wastewater treatment using ‘sustai nable’ biological alternatives like lagoons and 
constructed wetlands is gaining preference over physico -chemical treatment technologies due to the 
conventional systems’ apparent inability to reduce BOD 5/COD loads to environmentally acceptable 
concentrations (Chunkao et al. , 2014). The passive nature of wetland systems mimicked by CWs 
with regard to low maintenance cost provides for a much better prospect in this regard (Van 
Oostrum, 1990).Their treatment capacity can be optimized by carefully considering an intermittent 
loading inflow to increase oxygen transfer, proper substrate selection and recirculation the effluent 
water. However, there is need for further research in order to help define and optimize  design criteria 
with a view of long -term performance capabilities and limitations (Brix et al. , 1994).  
Biological systems have also been seen to perform faster in the  tropical regions . However, fat 
emulsification may pose a challenge due to relatively hig h temperatures typical of such regions 
(Johns, 1995). In addition, biological processes require long retention times and large reactor 
volumes with sludge control problems ( Irshad et al. , 2015). Notwithstanding , researches by (Kayser 
and Kunst, 2005; Soroko  2007; Cui et al. , 2010; Vymazal 2010; Lavrova and Koumanova, 2013) 
have illustrated the efficiency of CWs  as a biological treatment option .  Treatment efficiencies for 
constructed wetland studies have shown removal efficiencies varying from 85% - 95% for COD, 
BOD 5, TSS, NH 4-N, colour, coliform, and faecal bacteria. 80% - 90% removal efficiency has been 
observed for TKN, EC, and organic compounds ( Molle, Prost -Boucle and Lienard, 2008 ; Lavrova 
and Koumanova, 2013).  9 
 It is also indicated that BOD 5 can be eff iciently removed by VFWs treating effluent from oxidation 
ponds which produce effluent with a BOD 5 concentration of about 200mg/L. (Chunkao et al. , 2015). 
Given that the effluent from the ponds is still  too high for aquatic ecosystems, vertical sub -surface 
flow wetlands are particularly useful as a secondary treatment measure in such a case  (Soroko 2007; 
Molle et al. , 2008 ; Chunkao et al. , 2014 ). Chunkao et al, 2015 observed that VSSFWs have been 
satisfa ctorily applied across Thailand for the same purpose.  
2.3 Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment  
Constructed wetlands are artificial systems that mimic natural wetland systems in treatment function 
of wastewaters. Treatment occurs through biotic pat hways such as plant nutrient uptake, microbial 
adsorption , bio-degradation or assimilation. Abiotic pathways include inter alia sedimentation of 
organic matter by substrate media, volatilization , and UV  treatment .  
Constructed wetlands can be classified as  either Free water surface (FWS) or as subsurface flow 
(SSF) systems. As the name suggests, FWS  wetlands have above ground water flow while SSF are 
characterised by gravitational water flows within porous substrate media.   Under SSF, there are two 
other types of wetland systems  namely ; horizontal (HSSF) and vertical (VSSF) based on direction 
of water flow. The major difference between both systems as noted generally is oxygen transport 
within the wetlands . VSSF have better  oxygen transfer ability by multiple mechanisms and as such 
is used in the scope of this study. (Description adapted from K yambogo, Mbwette , T., Katima, 
Ladegaard and Jшrgensen , n.d). 
These treatment systems have gained much recognition over the decades. T his is because they are 
cost effective in terms of design, construction, operation and management. Furthermore, they 
require substantially less treatment area than conventional systems. Social acceptance of CWs is 
good owing to their ability to create recr eation habitats and/or enhance natural ecosystems thereby 
improving quality of life.  
The use of CW technology in the treatment of various wastewaters in Africa has been under 
investigation for a number of years. To date, this technology remains largely unused because little 
is still known about design and pollutant removal processes. Tanzania has in the last two decades 
stepped up investment in CW technology. This is owing to the great need for sustainable wastewater 
management alternatives for over 80% of the country  (Kyambogo et al., n.d) . Success achieved by 
Tanz ania in implementation of CW in treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater sets 
precedent for its use in Kenya. Studi es by ( Kimwaga  et al. , 2013 and Senteu , 2014)  treating 10 
 domestic effluen t water, (Abira, 2008) treating paper mill wastewater and  (Bodin , 2013) treating 
sugar factory wastewater have further confirmed this.  
2.3.1 Vertical Flow W etlands  
Vertical flow wetlands were initially designed to provide higher levels of oxygen transfer for 
enhanced effluent treatment (Al Jawaheri, 2011). Nevertheless, they have remained less popular 
than conventional technologies due to information gaps on design a nd operation variables. There 
are a number of basic dimensions (feed mode, time, space, and biological complexity) to consider 
in the use of VFWs.  
VFWs can either be planted or unplanted. Coleman, Hench, Garbut, Sextone, Bissonnette and 
Skouusen, ( 2001) ; Zhu, Sun, Zhang, Wu, Jia and Zang , (2012) observed that the presence of 
vegetation had minor variations on treatment efficiency of wastewater compared to action of gravel 
media. Abdelhakeem, et al.  (2015) observed the contrary where, results indicated a si gnificant 
difference in mass removal rates for most pollutants except for ammonia and phosphorous. Removal 
efficiencies of COD, BOD 5, TSS and NH+4 were observed to be 75%, 84%, 75% and 32% for the 
planted beds compared to 29%, 37%, 42% and 26% respectively , for the unplanted beds.  
There is an indication that plants contribute more to nutrient uptake rather than organic matter 
reduction but even this is arguable. Langegraber, (2005) suggested that plant role is minimal 
compared to wastewater loading . He obs erved that nutrient uptake was 1.9 % in treatment of 
municipal waste compared to 46 % for lower loaded systems. Further to this, plants have been noted 
to be a source rather than sink for organic matter in poorly managed systems. These findings give 
an ind ication that plant function is minimal to negligible for treatment of high strength wastewaters  
and more so, organic matter .  
The choice of either continuous or batch feed, time of wastewater retention in the system and level 
of microbial activity all cont ribute to the quality of effluent water obtained. The most common mode 
of operation is an intermittent loading of wastewater to the wetland surface until flooded, after 
which the water is allowe d to percolate down through a substrate medium. The wetland is  fed pulse -
wise after the previous batch has drained thus allowing oxygen diffusion into the bed.  As such, 
VFWs are far more aerobic than their HF counterparts, which make them very effective in organic 
matter and suspended solids removal. In a study by ( Stefanakis and Tsihrintzis, 2012) on various 
design and operational characteristics, it was observed that, among all the constituent parameters 11 
 monitored, OM removal achieved the highest efficiency. BOD 5 and COD exceeded 75% and 79% 
respectively. This indi cates that OM is easily bio -degradable and is easily removed from the system.  
VSSFWs are particularly poor in nitrogen remo val especially in the form of NH 4-N (Van Oostrum 
and Cooper 1990) in cases where the wastewater has high COD. However, if anoxic microhabitats 
exist as a result of high organic matter available (acting as bacterial energy source ), some 
denitrification may occur.  Moreover, i f the system design and mode of op eration is targeted at NH 4-
N removal, substantial treatment results can be obtained. In a study by Connolly et al. , 2004, NH 4-
N removal occurred mainly by adsorption to the reed bed media (64%) while the rest was 
transformed to NO 2-N (4%) and NO 3-N (24%).  
Design and operational mechanisms in vertical flow constructed wetlands  
Vertical sub -surface flow wetlands can either be shallow excavations in the ground or built above 
ground depending on slope required for influent water flow and recirculation requirem ents. 
Treatment performance in VFCWs is said to depend on a number of operational factors that are tied 
to system design, wastewater characteristics and application (Stefanakis and  Tsihrintzis, 2012). 
System related factors include substrate type, substrate pore size, bed depth, climate and maturity 
of the system (Bojcevska and Tonderski, 2007; Prochaska, Zouboulis and Eskridge, 2007). The 
wastewater characteristics are related to nutrient load, while application related factors include the 
hydrauli c loading rate (HLR), influent concentration (Q) and level of wastewater pre -treatment. 
These application factors result in a hydraulic retention time (HRT) that is unique to a system if 
treated as a ‘black box’ where HRT is a response variable; which has a significant influence on 
extent of wastewater treatment.

12 
 Substrate characteristics  
The choice of substrate media is crucial in wetland design. Grain size, media depth and pore size 
all contribute significantly to HRT, establishment of effective microbial communities in addition to 
removal efficiencies of different polluta nts. The media must be fine enough to retain organic matter 
yet rough enough to ensure no clogging occurs while maintaining good oxygen penetration 
(Torrens, Molle, Boutin and Salgot, 2009). Each substrate has uniquely behaving structure and 
texture which evolve over time, making it difficult to generally characterize into given filter types.  
Global knowledgebase on behaviour of different substrates is little known also because water 
content and flow mechanisms vary greatly in complexity (Molle, Liénard, G rasmick and Iwema, 
2006). The need for locally available substrate in any region where CW technology is applied 
creates precedent for further intensified studies on use of different media for optimal pollutant 
removal.  
Wastewate r loading method and mode o f operation  
Mode of wastewater application plays a key role in determining the aerobic condition of the wetland 
and rate of substrate clogging.  Given that VFWs require aerobic conditions for OM breakdown and 
subsequent BOD 5 reduction, a feeding mode that enhances maximal oxygen transfer is important. 
There are s everal pathways for oxygen penetration into the substrate media . These  include , gas 
diffusion that occurs between doses and rest periods and which is considered as the primary aeration 
process (Kays er and Kunst, 2005). Others include convection as a result of batch feeding and dilute 
oxygen present in the wastewater.  
A study by Zhao et al.  (2003 ) demonstrated that the highest pollutant removal rates were achieved 
after a short saturation time follow ed by a long unsaturated time . This  allow ed good oxygen transfer 
in the media bed. Feeding mode is also known to a role in determining the extent and type of 
treatment processes within the wetland. COD removal and nitrification appeared to be dependent 
on feeding frequency in a study by (Bancolé, Brissaud and Gnagne, 2003). He showed that a higher 
feeding frequency of small volumes greatly enhanced both OM breakdown and nitrification. 
However, the removal trend of nitrogen observably reduced while that of C OD remained constant, 
agreeing with findings by (Molle et al. , 2006). This was attributable to the preferential nitrification 
that occurred during rest periods between batches. Caution should be applied in the fractionating of 
batches because higher fracti ons may increase HRT, but at the expense of oxygenation within the 
system.  13 
 Bancolé et al.  (2003) observed that lower daily fractions promoted even development of biofilm 
over the substrate depth which accumulates on the upper substrate layers for high loading 
frequencies. The latter diminishes hydraulic conductivity thus negatively affecting i nfiltration rat e 
and oxygen transfer potential. This  in turn threatens the wetland’s lifecycle (Torrens et al. , 2009). 
In contrast, Bojcevska and Tonderski, (2007) proposed that the diminishing hydraulic conductivity 
was caused by anoxic microhabitats rath er than increasing hydraulic loads. Both schools of thought 
illustrate the behaviour of newly created systems, which are known to have an initially high nutrient 
removal capacity which reduces steadily until they stabilize.  
Resting periods between feeding  batches are also important especially in the case where a change 
of treatment includes a n increase in load application. General studies indicate that  resting period  
deters excessive biomass accumulation and retards substrate clogging  (Bojcevska and Tonder ski, 
2007) . Prochaska et al.  (2007) noted that organic matter which was not decomposed in previous 
feeding applications was transferred to lower depths of the treatment units . That  contributed to an 
increase in effluent COD concentrations during subsequent  treatments. In such instances, a 
significant carryover effect may be experienced and this may impact results on treatment efficiency.  
Another factor of feeding mode is recirculation. Numerous studies on wastewater treatment show 
that effluent recirculati on at a ratio of 1:1 greatly enhances purification capacity of a CW, more so 
in the case of high strength wastewater ( Connolly et al. , 2004; Zhao et al. , 2004 ; Sun et al. , 2005;  
Lavrova and Koumanova, 2010;  Lavrova and Koumanova, 2011;  Prost -Boucle and Molle, 2012; 
Lavrova and Koumanova, 2013).  
Hydraulic  Retention Time (HRT), flow rate and Loading rates  
Hydraulic retention time is generally known to have a positive linear relationship with nutrient 
removal efficiency (Wu, Zhang, Li, Fan and Zou, 2013). This is regulated by flow rate of influent 
wastewater. A high flow rate would promote faster percolation of water through the media , reducing 
contact time for microbial action (Lavrova and Koumanova, 2013) . Consequently, measures like 
recircul ation would be required to improve treatment efficiency.  
The HLR substantially impacts treatment efficiency of any give wetland system, particularly in 
tropical regions due to suitability of temperature for rapid OM breakdown and thus substrate 
evolution.  For a given HL, a high volume of wastewater applied in batch mode may favour oxygen 
penetration and increase infiltration rate but at the same time may also reduce exchange between 
mobile and less mobile water (Molle et al. , 2006). On the other hand, decr easing the batch volume 14 
 increases retention time of the water which allows greater exchange between the mobile and less 
mobile pore water. There is therefore extended interaction between biofilm and percolating water, 
which increases removal efficiency of pollutants.  
System clogging is a very big operational concern for vertical flow systems. This is largely 
influenced by operational factors aforementioned i.e. feeding mode, loading rates and substrate 
(Prochaska et al. , 2007). It is therefore important to  have a good balance between all factors in order 
to minimize chances of system clogging (Stefanakis and Tsihrintzis, 2012). Jing, Lin, Wang and 
Lee, (2002) and Lin, Jing, Lee and Wang,  (2002) established that application of different HLRs 
successively fr om low to high in experimental design will most likely introduce an undesirable 
effect of system ageing.  As such, it would be particularly important to design experiments that have 
simultaneous loads (Bojcevska and Tonderski, 2007) rather than step wise i ncrements in HLR, in 
order to determine optimal operation capacity of substrate while avoiding rapid system collapse.  
2.4 Pollutant removal processes  in Constructed Wetlands  
Many studies have shown that t he main pollutants of concern in wetlands treating slaughterhouse 
wastewater are usually organic matter and nitrogen fractions as they constitute the largest pollutant 
fraction. There exist significant variations in pollutant removal processes between and within different 
treatment systems. This is attribu table to complex physical, biological and chemical interactions 
facilitating the treatment (Moshi, 2015).  
The first recommended step in pollutant removal is usually pre -treatment . Solid particles are 
removed in order to retard their further breakdown and consequent increase of COD (Al Jawaheri, 
2011). The second step is to check and correct for pH. The optimum pH operation range for 
biological systems is usually  between 6.8 - 8.5. Any  values above or below this could retard 
functional efficiency of microbial c ommunities present (Goronszy, Eckenfelder  and Froelich, 
1992). Nitrification process is known to reduce alkalinity of wastewater and as such significant 
nitrification may result i n lowered pH and hinder denitrification ( Kadlec and Knight, 1996 ). 
According to literature denitrification can be hampered at pH < 6.0 and pH > 8.0, with an optimal 
rate observed at pH range 7.0 -7.5 (U.S. EPA, 1975)  (cited by  Saeed and Sun, [2012]). It is therefore 
recommende d to lime acidic wastewaters and  add sulphuric acid or CO 2 gas to alkaline waters 
(Britz, Van Schalkwyk and Hung , 2006).  
Nitrogen removal processes are generally known to be significantly influenced by temperature and 
dissolved oxygen  (Bodin, 2013) . Tuncsiper , (2007) reported  7% higher NH 4-N removal, during 
summer in comparison to winter i n constructed wetlands  treating  tertiary effluents. Langergraber, 15 
 Tietz and Haberl, (2007) indicated that  NH 4-N concentration in the effluent of VF wetlands  
increased  when temperature dropped below 12 0C.  
According to ( Saeed and Sun, 2012), n itrogen transformation and consequent removal occurs in 
three main pathways. These are biological (ammonification, nitrifica tion, denitrification, plant 
uptake and biomass assimilation), physi co-chemical inter -alia (ammonia volatilization and 
adsorption) and those dependent on microbial metabolism. The latter are newly discovered and 
include partial nitrification, denitrificati on anammox and canon process.  
The order of transformation depends on high amount of organic nitrogen in the wastewater, in which 
case, ammonification initiates transformation. This is followed by nitrification. Conversely, high 
amounts of NH 4-N in the wa stewater initiate the nitrification step first. Obligate chemolithotrophic 
bacteria consume oxygen to form NO 2-N, which is then transformed to NO 3-N by facultative 
chemolithotrophs. Heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria are also known to nitrify NH 4-N. The 
denitrification process which follows,  occurs by bacterial action to produce nitrogen gas (N 2), 
nitrous oxide (NO 2) and nitric oxide (NO) (Matheson and Sukias, 2010) all of which from 
bicarbonate salts resulting to raised  water pH (Kadlec and Wallace, 2009).  
Biomass assimilation proceeds through incorporation of NH 4-N in the heterotrophic biomass to 
fulfil nutrient requirements. Nitrogen assimilation via biomass had been reported in VF wetlands, 
fed with diluted pig slurry supernatant (Sun et al.,  2005). The authors noted that nitrification 
accounted for only <  10% of the NH 4-N removal, while overall NH 4-N removal ranged between 27 
and 48%. Since the organic loading and removal rates in the experimental systems were higher, 
assimilation of NH 4-N into heterotro phic biomass could have played a vital role, in terms of nitrogen 
removal (Sun et al., 2005) . 
The physico -chemical process of a mmonia volatilization occurs through mass transfer of the gas 
into the atmosphere (off -gas). It is highly dependent on wastewater  pH. Wastewater with high 
alkalinity (pH > 9.3) results in NH 4-N conversion to NN 3 gas which is then volatilized  (Cooper et 
al., 1996; Bialowiec et al.,  2011) . Ammonia volatilization is generally insignificant in subsurface 
flow wetlands,  when the pH value  is below 7.5 -8.0 (Reddy and Patrick, 1984)  (cited by Saeed and 
Sun, [2012]).  
Adsorption in wetland systems is governed by medi a-cation exchange ( Bayley, Davison and 
Headley,  2003) in the water. Media with cation exchange properties has been employed in wetland 
systems to optimize nitrogen removal (Yalcuk and Ugurlu, 2009; Cui et  al., 2010; Saeed and Sun, 16 
 2011 ). In VF systems, the adsorbed NH 4-N can be nitrified by the attache d biofilms (Connolly et 
al., 2004), due to predominant aerobic conditions inside the media. In addition, the reduction of 
NH 4-N concentration in the bulk water can stimulate the release of adsorbed NH 4-N, for maintaining 
chemical equilibrium (Vymazal, 2007 ). In such cases, adsorption can only facilitate the conversion 
of nitrogen, without changing the net quantity in wastewater. Matrix oriented adsorption processes 
are not frequently observed in wetland systems since common wetland media gravel has very low  
adsorption capacity (Keffala and Ghrabi, 2005).  
Suspended solids, BOD and COD removal are not as sensitive to temperature (Kadlec and Wallace, 
2009) therefore indicating that physical processes like retention time and sedimentation rate are the 
major dete rminants for TSS while bio -chemical interactions control the latter. Presence of 
macrophytes is known to increase the sedimentation process, particularly through  retarding re -
suspension of the sediment particles by trapping them in the root/litter layer (K adlec and Wallace, 
2009).  
Organic compounds can be degraded aerobically and anaerobically in subsurface flow wetlands. 
Oxygen for aerobic degradation can be supplied via atmospheric oxygen diffusion, convection 
(wind effect), and/or macrophyte root transfe r into the plant rhizosphere (Cooper et al., 1996). 
Aerobic degradation is facilitated by chemoheterotrophs which have a faster metabolic rate than 
chemoautotrophs (Saeed and Sun, 2012). Oxidised organic matter utilised the available oxygen to 
release carb on dioxide ammonia and other stable compounds (Garcia et al., 2010). Due to the higher 
availability of oxygen provided by vertical flow systems, aerobic degradation of organic matter 
occurs preferentially (Saeed and Sun, 2012).  
Anaerobic degradation takes  place in media zones devoid of oxygen. It is a two -step process 
performed by heterotrophic bacteria through fermentation. Acid forming bacteria convert organic 
matter into organic acids and alcohols (Saeed and Sun, 2012). Breakdown can also occur due to 
action of methane forming bacteria through methanogenesis. This group converts organic matter to 
new cells, methane and carbon dioxide as well. Both fermentation and methanogenesis occur in 
anaerobic media zones (Kadlec and Knight, 1996)  and have very diver se pathways of compound 
transformation.  
2.5 Effects of e nvironmental variability  in Constructed Wetlands  
Climatic conditions have a cascading effect on the treatment efficiency of constructed wetlands due 
to their influence on abiotic factors such as s olar radiation, temperature, precipitation and 17 
 evapotranspiration  (ET)  (Kadlec and Wallace, 2009 ). These factors in turn affect biotic processes 
such as microbial and vegetation activity within the wetland. Studies on the influence of climate 
strongly indicate a significant difference in performance of CWs in Temperate and Tropical  regions.  
These dif ferences reveal that  design, operational and maintenance strategies used for these regions 
are not directly replicable (Bodin, 2013).  
Tropical climates experiencing warm and dry climates are particularly vulnerable to environmental 
vagaries  such as rainfal l and evapotranspiration . Both of these are important in that they influence 
the water balance in a CW system.  Small scale wetland systems frequently show enhanced ET due 
to advection from the relatively warm and dry terrestrial surrounding ( Kadlec and Wal lace, 2009 ; 
Borin et al. , 2011). Ev apotranspiration is a significant consideration in constructed wetlands 
because it has the potential to substantially affect functioning and treatment efficie ncy of the 
wetland (Kadelc and Knight, 1996;  Bialoweic  et al. , 2006). Water volume passing through a CW 
system may decrease  under high ET, thus increasing the concentration of outflow dissolves 
compounds  and even lack of effluent water may be experienced as has been proven by ( Bialoweic  
et al. , 2006).  High ET in this case was observed to be in excess of 2.5 mm d−1.  
Macrophytes are another pathway for ET loss because of their low water use efficiency (Bialoweic 
and Wojnowska -Baryla, 2007; Headley et al. , 2012). Despite these observations, many studies 
conducted on CWs base their treatment results on differences between inflow and outflow pollutant 
mass removal rates without consideration for ET and water balance dynamics (Kyambadde et al. , 
2004) . In many instances, water loss within a CW is typically not negligible and therefore 
assessment of results using the latter method can lead to significant errors and observably differ 
from those factoring in ET, water balance dynamics ( Bialoweic et al. , 2014)

 CHAPTER THREE  
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
3.1 Study Area  
Njoro slaughterhouse is located in the agricultural town of Njoro Town. This lies approximately 18 
km south west of Nakuru, Kenya (-0.31358, 35.95829 ), with a growing population of about 64,881  
people, spread across 124.6 km2 (Kenya B ureau of Standards - KEBS , 2013 ). The region receives 
1000mm of rainfall per year. There is one river, Njoro River which drains into the saline Lake 
Nakuru. Both surface and groundwater are an important source of portable water. The main 
economic activities are agri -based industries, saw -milling, crop and livestock farming, with the 
latter being practiced by about 80 % of the households mainly in mixed farming systems. In the 
past, the land was predominantly forests but due  to the expansion of agriculture and the general 
population growth, these have receded  (Rosa, 2009) . Egerton University is located about 7 km away 
from Njoro slaughterhouse making it a suitable location for experimental setup of the study  (Figure 
2). Proxi mity of the slaughterhouse to the University also informed the choice of location for the 
experimental setup.  19

 3.2 Sourcing of wastewater  
Njoro slaughterhouse is a mid -scale level facility and as such represents the larger portion of 
operating abattoirs around the country. The facility has an average daily production output of 
22 bovine heads. There are two waste separation channels, one for  blood and the second for 
carcass processing water, each leading into the respective collection tank. However, these 
channels are not an efficient separation technique as blood mixes with processing water during 
washing of the facility. On average about 12 00L are used for facility cleaning under low meat 
demand while 250 L of fresh water is used per cow ( Personal communication Ndirangu - 
Manager at Njoro slaughterhouse, 2016). The facility has three settling tanks for wastewater 
that are connected in series.  For this study, wastewater was exhausted from the last of these 
tanks for use in experimental setup as it had sufficient amount of wastewater for running the 
setup. The exhausted water sample was transported to the experimental site and stored in plastic 
tanks with a total holding volume of 800 L.  
 
3.3 Study design  
The study design consisted of a preparation  stage where substrate sieve analysis was done to 
obtain the appropriate diameter sizes for the test substrates used. Sieve analysis was conducted  
in the civil engineering laboratory at E gerton University to verify diameter size of each 
substrate type before filling the respective  mesocosm s. The substrate sizes were according to 
specifications outlined in Table 2  below.  The experimental setup  stage included: a) preliminary 
wastewater characterization  in order to obtain values on influent concentrations of the study 
parameters , b) System  configuration in which the treatments were set up  (Figure 3) , c) 
Operation  mode  used and d) sampling method of the wastewater.  21

 3.3.1 Substrate  sour cing and sievi ng analysis  
Ballast was sourced form quarries within Nakuru County and transported to the Civil 
Engineering lab in Egerton University, Njoro  for the sieve analysis . Grad ing was done using 5 
mm and 2 mm sieves to obtain sand of 2 -4 mm diameter. Fine gravel of 8 -9 mm was obtained 
by using sieves of 6mm and 9.2 mm. Mid -sized gravel of 16 -18 mm was obtained by using 16 
mm and 19 mm sieves. Finally, coarse gravel of 20 -24mm w as obtained using 20mm and 25 
mm sieves. After separation, all the substrates were washed to reduce silt and other organic 
impurities and dried. Each substrate type was then filled into the respective mesocosms at 
required media depths for the study , (APPENDIX  1). 
3.3.2 Experimental setup  
System configuration  
The experiment was set up outdoors and consisted of four cylindrical metal  tank mesocosms  
of 0.3m diameter , each  with four similar replicates totalling to sixteen tanks. Eight of these 
tanks had a media depth of 0.9m (0.8 + 0.1) and the other eight had 0.75m (0.65 + 0.1) depth. 
The 0.9 m columns represented deep mesocosms while 0.75 m columns represented shallow 
mesocosms. All units has a supporting layer of 20  mm gravel to a height of 0.1  m on top of 
which, two replicates of each depth were filled with substrate media of either coarse sand 2-4 
mm, gravelly sand 8 -9.2 mm, fine gravel 16 -19 mm or mid -size gravel 20 ± 5 mm.  Each 
mesocosm was fitted with a half inch tap 0.1 m from the bottom to acts as the outlet. An effluent 
bucket with a holding capacity of 20 L was placed 0.2  m below each mesocosm to act as a 
collection unit during sampling. The media beds were not planted due to a lack of determinable 
importance in organic matter reduction.  
The mesocosms were labelled A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1 and D2. A1 and A2 represented 2 
mm sand at 0.65 m and 0.8 m depth. B1 and B2 represented 16 mm gravel at 0.65 m and 0.8 
m depth. C1 and C2 represented 8 mm gravel at 0.65 m and 0.8 m depth. D1 and D2 represented 
20 mm gravel at 0.65 m and 0.8 m depth , (APPENDIX  2). The setup was shaded from extreme 
heat and rain in order to reduce the anticipated effect s of environmental varia bility. The 
mesocosms were also arranged in random order in two rows of eight in order to account for the 
same.  23 
 Wastewater characterisation  
Samples were collected from the slaughterhouse’ holding chambers and analysed for 5 day 
Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD 5), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD ), ammonia nitrogen 
(NH 4-N), total suspended solids ( TSS), pH, electrical conductivity ( EC), dissolved oxygen 
(DO) and temperature using standard protocols outlined in APHA , (2004 ). The wastewater was 
allowed to settle ove rnight and afterwards it was filled in all the mesocosms, submerging the 
media beds. The wastewater rested in the mesocosms for ten days prior to commencement of 
the operation and sampling phase. This was in order to allow microbial communities develop. 
Integrated effluent samples were collected after the period and analysed again for BOD 5, COD, 
NH 4-N, TSS, pH, EC, DO and temperature.  The data obtained was used to establish influent 
concentrations at the beginning of the study. The study ran for three month s from January to 
March 2016.  
 
Calculation of loadings, removal rates and efficiencies  
Calculations are adapted from formulas presented by (Abdelhakeem et al. , 2015) in a related 
study.  
1) Both organic (OLR) and hydraulic (HLR) loading rates were determined using the 
equations below.  
𝑂𝐿𝑅  (𝑔/𝑚2/𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐 ℎ)= (Q∗𝐶𝑖)/As         (1) 
𝐻𝐿𝑅  (𝑚3/𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐 ℎ) = Q/As         (2) 
Where Q = discharge rate (m3 per day)  
Ci = concentration of influe nt (mg/L)  
As= surface area of the mesocosm (m2) 
2) Removal efficiencies of pollutants in the mesocosms were calculated using the equation 
below and represented as percentages  
𝑅𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑎𝑙  𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦  (%) =((𝐶𝑖 − 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡)/ (𝐶𝑖) ∗ 100 )     (3) 
Where C i and C out = influent and effluent concentrations respectively  24 
 3) Mass removal rates of each pollutant were calculated using the equation below as amount 
of pollutant removed in g/m2/day. The results were presented in Appendix 6.  
𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑠  𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑎 𝑙 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒  (𝑔/𝑚2/𝑑𝑎𝑦 ) =𝑄∗(𝐶𝑖−𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑡)     (4) 
Where Q is  discharge rate (m3 per day) , Ci and C out are influent and effluent concentrations 
respectively  
3.4 System operation  
The setup was operated  in a batch flow method . Buckets with a 4mm perforation at the bottom 
and a set flow rate of 41 ml min-1, were chosen as the wastewater distribution mechanism. 
These buckets were initially corked at the bottom using an improvised plug and placed on the 
rim of each mesocosm. They were then filled wit h wastewater to coincide with respective 
volume for the sample depths and the bottom unplugged to release water into the mesocosms. 
The dee p mesocosms were fed with 30 L  of water while the shallow mesocosms received 25 L 
of wastewater.  Both flow rate and i nfluent concentrations of BOD 5 and COD were used to 
calculate the hydraulic and organic loads of organic matter going into the mesocosms . Spatial 
replication was considered in the design by having a replicate of each mesocosm, while 
temporal replication was considered by repeated sampling for each retention time under study . 
3.4.1 Water sample collection  
Experimental sampling involved the co llection of  an integrated  influent water sample and 
individual effluent water samples of every mesocosm unit . During every sampling session, 
physical -chemical parameters: pH, EC, DO and temperature were measured in situ  using a 
calibrated HQ 40d (HACH) mul ti-meter. Five sample replicates were collected for each of the 
retention times  studied. These were in the order of HRT at 1, 3 and 5 days . During sampling, 
the columns were drained in such a way that  an integrated sample was collected from the 
botto m and upper half of each column. This method  facilitated  an analysis  of the  vertical 
treatment profile of the pollutants in  each mesocosm . A known volume of both bucket and 
mesocosm capacities were used to estimate half of the total sample volume  contained in each 
mesocosm .  The drained water samples were then re -circulated into their respective mesocosms  
at a ratio of 1:1 and set flow rate of 41 ml min-1.  
Between e ach HRT , the mesocosms were rested for 3 days to allow re -oxygenation of the 
subst rate. Wastewater previously collected from the slaughterhouse and stored was diluted with 25 
 the partially treated effluent water obtained at the end of each experiment stage . The resulting 
mixture was characterised and  fed into the mesocosms for the next exp eriment cycle . 
Effluent samples collected every sampling period were immediately transported to Egerton 
University aquatic sciences Laboratory  in 500ml plastic bottles for analysis using APHA , 
(2004 ) methods. Parameters determined included COD, BOD 5, TSS and NH 4-N. Standard 
calibration curves for each parameter were prepared using the same methods  and absorbance 
readings were taken using a GENESYS 10uv scanning spectrophotometer.  
3.4.2 Water sample analys is 
Description of analytical procedures and ap paratus used in this study  is detailed below. 
Samples were analysed in duplicate for each mesocosm at bottom and upper half sampling 
depths. APHA, (2004 ) standard methods were used for sample analysis. Volume of sample 
used for analysis of each test parame ter was adjusted according to appropriate dilution ratios 
identified in the preliminary test phase. Blank samples were also analysed for each test 
parameter in order to provide a background concentration and correction standard for 
anomalous values  identif ied in the analysis . 
BOD 5 determination  
A sample volume was added to BOD 5 bottles of known volume and topped up with aerated 
distilled water having  an oxygen concentration of (7.2 -7.6 mg/ L). The initial DO was 
determined  and sample bottles carefully fi lled to exclude air bubbles then capped tightly  and 
stored in the dark at 20oC for five days. After the 5 days, f inal DO was determined and BOD 5 
calculated using the equation below . A volume of  0.5 ml was used in the initial dilutions and 
later increased to 1 ml sample as the BOD 5 decreased.  
𝐵𝑂𝐷 5 (𝑚𝑔/𝐿)=((𝐵−𝑆)∗𝑣𝑏))/𝑐         (5) 
Where:  
B = DO in blank after 5 days  
S = initial oxygen in bottle  
vb = volume of BOD sample bottle  
c = volume of sample used  26 
 COD determination  
Oxidation of organic matter was done by adding 1.5 ml K 2Cr2O7 digestion solution to 2.5 ml 
sample contained in a digestion tube and then adding 3.5 ml H 2SO 4/Ag 2SO 4, forming an acid 
layer at the bottom.  40 fold dilution  of the sample was used.  The tubes we re swirled to 
homogenise the contents and then p laced in a heating block at 150oC for 2hrs. The samples 
were left overnight to cool and  absorbance read at 600 nm using a GENESYS 10uv scanning 
spectrophotometer . The values obtained were checked against resp ective  standard curve 
absorbencies to obtain actual pollutant concentrations . Bio-degradability index was calculated 
as the fraction BOD 5/COD in order to determine whether the organic matter present could be 
biologically degraded easily.  
NH 4-N determination  
Sodium salicylate method was applied 0.06 ml sample was used for analysis . Reagents of 
sodium salicylate and hypochlorite solution were added consecutively and the samples stored 
in the dark at 25oC for 90 minutes. Thereafter, absorbance was read at 665 nm using a 
GENESYS 10uv scanning spectrophotometer for concentration relation with standard curves.  
TSS determination  
Total suspended solids were determined gravimetrically on Whatman GFC filters which had 
been pre -dried at 95oC for 24 h ours to achieve a constant weight and eliminate filter moisture. 
A definite volume of sample was filtered and then dried for 3 hrs to a constant weight. 
Difference in weights of the filters before (Wf) and after combustion (Wc) were calculated in 
grams, taking in to account the volume filtered.   
𝑇𝑆𝑆  (𝑚𝑔/𝐿)=((𝑊𝑐 − 𝑊𝑓)∗ 106)/𝑣−1        (6) 
Organic matter content was also determined by subtracting weight of the ashed filters at 500  
oC (AFDW) from the TSS value.

3.5 Data management and analysis  
MS Excel was used for raw data entry and management before transfer to R softw are version 
0.98.1103.0 for  both descriptive and inferential analysis. It is important to note tha t aggregation 
of the data set re sulted in data that had a higher variabil ity than the individual mesocos m 
performance.  27 
 3.5.1 Descriptive statistics  
Measures of central tendency were described using pastecs package (Grosjean  and Ibanez, 
2014) for arithmetic mean s, standard error and coefficients of variation  then presented as  tables 
and boxplots  for visual interpretation . Boxplots were used to identify outliers  using sciplots 
(Morales, M., R Development Core Team and Murdoch , D., 2012) , Histograms  and QQ plots  
to determine distributio n of the data set, which was observed to be non -normally spread. Excel 
was also used to assist in graphical represent ation of  this information.  
3.5.2 Inferential statistics  
ANOVA  
Multifactorial ANOVA was conducted on transformed data for HRT 1 and 5, testing effect of 
substrate and depth on pollutant removal. Location of significance was also tested using 
TukeyHSD post -hoc test.  ANOVA was preceded by Shapiro -Wilk normality test and Bartlett 
post-Hoc test followed by  Log transformation. The data for HRT  3 still had a high variance 
therefore Kruskal Wallis rank sum test was used and location of significant differences verified 
using post -hoc Nemenyi test at p < 0.05 ( Pohlert, 2014).  28 
 CHAPTER FOUR  
RESULTS  
4.1 Slaughterhouse w astewater characteristics  
A preliminary  analysis of the wastewater was done in order to establish characteristics of the 
slaughterhouse effluent  (Table 3) . The slaughterhouse wastewater was then fed into each 
mesocosm, submerging the media and left for 10 days in order to allow developm ent of 
microbial communities , adapted from  (Wu et al.,  2013) . No seeding was required as the 
wastewater had sufficient microbes. Afterwards, the mesocosms were emptied and effluent 
samples analysed . Table 3 below gives a summary of arithmetic means with standard 
deviations  for the wastewater parameters selected . The fresh sample was analysed in triplicate 
(n = 3) while the detained wastewater was analysed in duplicate for each mesocosm (n = 32).  
The wastewater characteristics were observed to be higher th an reported ranges similar

The difference in concentration of the pollutants analysed initially and  after 10 day s detention 
indicates that microbial communities established themselves well within the substrate media . 
This step was seen to act as pre -treatment  stage  and was very beneficial in pollutant reduction  
especially for COD , NH 4-N and TSS.  
4.2 Temporal variations of slaughterhouse wastewater  characteristics  
During the c ourse of the three month study, concentration of in-situ parameters of the 
slaughterhouse effl uent wastewater was monitored and results summarised in (Table 4 ) below.  
Wastewater was collected from the slaughterhouse septic tank in December and stored in 29 
 plastic tanks at the experiment site for the duration of the experiment. It was replenished in 
February after required experimental volumes decreased. Characterisation was done 
immediately before commencement of each experiment cycle.  This was aimed at establishing 
whether there were any significant variations in concentration of these parameters ove r time. 
Knowledge on physico -chemical parameters helped  elucidate patterns observed in effluent 
data, due to the strong inter -relationship between physical, chemical and biological 
characteristics of water.

Physico -chemical wastewater characteristics were taken monthly and presented as averages 
plus/minus standard error (n = 605). The months are representative of experimental sampling 
cycles in which Dec is wastewater charact erisation; Jan is 1 day retention time study. Feb is 3 
day retention time study and Mar is 5 day retention time study . *pH was presented as range.  
 
4.3 Hydraulic and organic loadings of BOD 5 and COD  
This study conducted a stepwise decrease in loadings by virtue of the depth treatments and 
wastewater concentration . Results indicated in (Table 5 ) below, that reduced loads under longer 
retention gave better results.  30 
 Table 5: Influent wastewater loads

0.0447  495.46  156.59  30.59  0.65 
Influent wastewater loads were calculated using Eq. (4) and (5) at each retention time for  the 
deep mesocosms having 0.8 m and shallow mesocosms having 0.65 m.  Hydraulic lading rate 
was higher for deeper mesocosms. Organic loading rate decreased between the retention times 
because the wastewater characteristics changed with increase in detentio n time of the stored 
slaughterhouse effluent.  
4.4 Pollutant removal efficiency  
Pollutant removal efficiency was calculated as a percentage of the difference between influ ent 
and effluent concentrations in (Table 6) below using  Eq. ( 3). Retention time of 5 days gave 
best results for TSS and NH 4-N while there was no determinable difference in removal 
efficiency between 3 day and 5 day retention time for both BOD 5 and COD. TSS removal 
efficiency varied at p < 0.001 between 5 -1day retention  and between 5-3 day retention for 
which 5 day retention gave best results  in both cases . NH 4-N was calculated in grams while 
BOD, COD and TSS were calculated in m illigrams . The output was graphically presented in 
(Figure 4) below.  Under one and three day  retention times, NH 4-N was observed to generally 
increase rather than decrease indicating that there were processes within the mesocosms that 
generated ammonia rather than reducing it.   31

4.5 Effect of substrate type and depth on pollutant removal efficiency  
4.4.1 Combined effect of substrate and depth on pollutant removal  for HRT 1  
Two way ANOVA was con ducted to establish the effect of  substrate - depth interactions  on 
pollutant removal for 1 day retention time. Results  in (Figure 5) indicated that substrate - depth 
interactions did not have a significant effect on removal of BOD  (ANOVA, F = 1.839, d.f. = 2, 
p = 0.16) , COD  (ANOVA, F = 1.853, d.f. = 2, p = 0.16), NH 4-N (ANOVA, F = 0.564 , d.f. = 2, 
p = 0.56) and TSS  (ANOVA, F = 0.897, d.f. = 2, p = 0.41). Further analysis was therefore 
carried out to investigate the individual effects of substrate and depth  on pollutant removal . 
4.4.2 The effect of s ubstrate on pollutant removal for HRT 1  
Effect of substrate type on pollutant r emoval was assessed using one way ANOVA  (Figure 6) . 
Differences were considered to be strongly significant at α < 0.05 and weakly significant at  α 
< 0.1. Significance values were tabulated in (APPENDIX 3).  BOD removal was observed to 
be unaffected by substrate treatments  (ANOVA, F = 0.613, d.f. = 2, p > 0.05). COD showed -20020406080100

 weak differences in performance  between q uarry dust and g ravel (ANOVA, F = 2.542, d.f. = 
2, p < 0.1).  NH 4-N showed treatment differences between sand and gravel (ANOVA, F = 4.731, 
d.f. = 2, p < 0.1) and between sand and quarry dust (ANOVA,  F = 4.731, d.f. = 2, p < 0.01),  in 
which s and was observed to perform best overall. TSS showed no significant differences in 
removal between the substrate treatments (ANOVA, F = 1.302, d.f. = 2, p > 0.1).  
  
Figure 5: Overall pollutant removal of substrate  treatments at HRT 1 .  
The treatments A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2, represent sand at 0.65 m and 0.80 m, 16mm gravel 
at 0.65 m and 0.80 m and 8mm gravel at 0.65 m and 0.80 m respectively  
 
4.4.3 The effect of depth  on pollutant removal for HRT 1  
The importance of depth was examined for both 0.65 m and 0.8 m mesocosms.  One Way 
ANOVA was used to determine which mesocosms differed significantly in performance from 
each other. Results were prese nted as boxplot figures below  and significance levels tabulated 
in (APPENDIX 4) for 0.65m depth analysis and (APPENDIX 5) for 0.8 m depth analysis . 
Generally, it was observed that  BOD , COD and TSS showed no differences in treatment due 
to changes in depth.  
Mesocosm performance at 0.65 m depth  
Analysis of mesocosm performance at 0.65 m depth (Figure 6) indicated that all three substrates 
performed the same in terms of BOD, COD and TSS removal. Conversely, NH 4-N removal

 differed weakly between sand, quarry dust and gravel in which sand performed better than  both 
quarry dust  and gravel  (ANOVA, F = 3.661, d.f. = 2, p > 0.1).

Mesocosm performance at 0.8 m depth  
Investigation of the deeper mesocosm performance (Figure 7) indicated that BOD and TSS 
showed no significant differences in treatment for all the substrates (ANOVA, F = 2.144, d.f. = 
2, p > 0.1, F = 1.966, d.f. 2, p > 0.1).  COD and NH 4-N performance on the  other hand 
responded to depth treatment. There were weak relationships observed between sand, quarry 
dust and gravel. Both sand and gravel performed better than quarry dust (ANOVA, F = 3.861, 
d.f. = 2, p < 0.1).

4.4.4 Combined effect of substrate and depth on pollutant removal  for HRT 3  
Determination of the combined effect of substrate and depth on removal efficiency of pollutants 
was done using Kruskal  Wallis rank sum test. Results as indicated by (Figure 8) below showed 
that only BOD 5 and TSS were affected by substrate - depth interactions in pollutant reduction. 
In the treatment of BOD, 0.65 m gravel mesocosm performed better than 0.8 m quarry dust 
mesocosm (X2 = 17.095, d.f. = 5, p = 0.092 ). The 0.65 m quarry mesocosm outperformed the 
0.8 m gravel mesocosm (X2 = 17.095, d.f. = 5, p = 0.077), indicating that shorter mesocosms 
gave better results but neither  of substrates  outperformed the other . Sand gave better results 
than either gravel or quarry dust in the removal of TSS. The 0.8 m sand mesocosm performed 
better than 0.65 m gravel mesocosm ( X2 = 15.604, d.f. = 5, p = 0.015).  Gravel at 0.65 m 
performed better than quarry dust at 0.8 m ( X2 = 15.604,  d.f. = 5, p = 0.073).

 4.4.5 The effect of s ubstrate on pollutant removal for HRT 3  
The significance of substrate type  and si ze on the treatment efficiency of pollutants tested was 
determined and results of exact p values tabulated in (APPENDIX 3 ). Resul ts showed that only 
TSS removal was affected by changes in substrate. Sand was observed to perform better than 
gravel (X2 = 7.90, d.f. = 2, p < 0.05). While there were no differences in treatment identified 
between sand and quarry dust (X2 = 7.90, d.f. = 2,  p > 0.1), quarry dust gave better results than 
gravel  (X2 = 7.90, d.f. = 2, p < 0.05) .

 4.4.6 The effect of depth  on pollutant removal for HRT 3  
Mesocosm performance at 0.65 m depth  
The depth under study seemed to affect only TSS removal efficiency  (Figure 9). Both sand and 
quarry dust showed no differences in TSS removal (X2 = 6.34, d.f. = 2, p > 0.1) and performed 
better than gravel (X2 = 7.90, d.f. = 2, p < 0.1).

 Mesocosm performance at 0.8 m depth  
The depth under study seemed to affect only BOD removal efficiency  (Figure 10). Sand 
performed better than both gravel and quarry dust ( X2 = 9.91, d.f. = 2, p < 0.05).  There were 
no marked differences in treatment between gravel and qu arry dust (X2 = 9.91, d.f. = 2, p < 
0.1).

gravel at 0.8 m respectively  
 
4.4.7 Combined effect of substrate and depth on pollutant removal  for HRT 5  
Two way ANOVA was con ducted to establish the effect of  substrate - depth interactions  on 
pollutant removal for 5 day retention time  (Figure 11) . Results indicated that substrate - depth 
interactions did not have a significant effect on removal of BOD (ANOVA, F = 0.377, d.f. = 2,  
p = 0.68) , COD ( ANOVA, F = 1.17, d.f. = 2, p = 0.31). There were however, some differences 
observed in the removal of NH 4-N and TSS.  
For NH 4-N removal, sand perform ed better than both quarry dust and gravel (ANOVA, F = 
10.604, d.f. = 2, p = 0.000, p = 0. 000), while quarry performed better than  gravel  (ANOVA, F 
= 10.604, d.f. = 2, p < 0. 058). It should be noted  that p = 0.000  indicates interaction of other 
factors that affects the substrate  performance , therefore substrate effect cannot be considered 
alone . Quarry dust mesocosm at 0.8  m performed better than sand mesocosm at 0.65 m 
39 
 (ANOVA, F = 10.604, d.f. = 2, p = 0.011). Sand at both depths performed better than gravel at 
0.65 m (ANOVA, F = 10.604, d.f. = 2, p 0.008, p = 0.000). Inversely, the 0.8 m gravel 
mesocosm performed better than sand at both 0.65m  and 0.8 m (ANOVA, F = 10.604, d.f. = 2, 
p = 0.000, p = 0.011). Gravel at both 0.65m and 0.8 m depths also performed better than quarry 
dust (ANOVA, F = 10.604, d.f. = 2, p = 0.001 , p = 0.021).  
In the removal of TSS sand differed in performance from both quarry dust and gravel (ANOVA, 
F = 2.920, d.f. = 2, p = 0.012, p = 0.00 0), while quarry dust differed from gravel  (ANOVA, F 
= 2.920, d.f. = 2, p = 0.09 0). Sand at both 0.65m and 0.8 m depths outperfor med gravel at 0.65 
m (ANOVA, F = 2.920, d.f. = 2, p = 0.059, p = 0.000 ). Sand at 0.8 m depth outperformed 
quarry dust at both 0.65m and 0.8 m (ANOVA, F = 2.920, d.f. = 2, p = 0.012, p = 0.005) and 
gravel at 0.8 m (ANOVA, F = 2.920, d.f. = 2, p = 0.002) .  
4.4.8 The effect of s ubstrate on pollutant removal for HRT 5  
One way ANOVA was conducted to determine whether substrate alone affected pollutant 
removal efficiency of the mesocosms. Exact p values of ANOVA output were tabulated in 
(APPENDIX 3 ). The r esults showed that, d ifference in substrate affected removal efficiency 
of all pollutants.  
In the removal of BOD, sand performed better than both quarry dust and gravel (ANOVA, F = 
6.514 , d.f. = 2, p < 0.01, p < 0.01), while there was no significant difference in treatment 
between the latter two substrates  (ANOVA, F = 6.514, d.f. = 2, p > 0.1). Likewise, for COD 
removal, sand performed better than both quarry dust and gravel (ANOVA, F = 3.706, d.f. = 2, 
p < 0.01, p < 0.01), while there was no significant differe nce in treatment between the latter 
two substrates (ANOVA, F = 3.706, d.f. = 2, p > 0.1). Gravel performed better than sand and 
quarry dust in the removal of NH 4-N (ANOVA, F = 19.02 , d.f. = 2, p < 0.000, p < 0.1). Quarry 
dust also performed better than san d (ANOVA, F = 19.02, d.f. = 2, p < 0.1). It should be noted 
though , that p = 0.000  indicates interaction of other factors that affects the substrate  
performance , therefore substrate impact cannot be considered alone.  In the removal of TSS, 
sand was observed to give better performance than both quarry dust and gravel (ANOVA, F = 
11.58, d.f. = 2, p < 0.01. p <  0.000 ).   40

The treatments A1, A2, B1, B2,  C1 and C2, represent sand at 0.65 m and 0.80 m, 16mm gravel 
at 0.65m and 0.80 m and 8mm gravel at 0.65 m and 0.80 m respectively . 
4.4.9 The effect of depth  on pollutant removal for HRT 5  
The importance of depth was examined for both 0.65 m and 0.8 m mesoc osms.  One Way 
ANOVA was used to determine which mesocosms differed significantly in performance from 
each other. Results were presented as boxplot figures below  and as (APPENDIX 3 ) for 0.65m 
depth analysis and (APPENDIX 4 ) for 0.8 m depth analysis . General ly, it was observed that 
removal efficiency of all pollutants studied responded to changes in depth.  
Mesocosm performance at 0.65 m depth  
One way ANOVA analysis of mesocosm performance at 0.65 m depth for 5 day retention was 
done and graphically presented in (Figure 12) below. In the removal of BOD, sand only differed 
significantly in performance from gravel (ANOVA, F = 2.382, d.f. = 2, p <  0.1). No marked 
differences were observed between sand and quarry dust (ANOVA, F = 2.382, d.f. = 2, p > 0.1) 
or between quarry dust and gravel  (ANOVA, F = 2.382 , d.f. = 2, p >  0.1).  For COD removal, 
sand performed better than gravel (ANOVA, F = 4.135, d.f. = 2, p <  0.05) and quarry dust 
(ANOVA, F = 4.135 , d.f. = 2, p <  0.05). Performance of quarry dust was statist ically 
insignificant from that of gravel (ANOVA, F = 4.135 , d.f. = 2, p >  0.1). NH 4-N removal by 
gravel was better than bot sand and quarry dust (ANOVA, F = 7.082, d.f. = 2, p <  0.05, p < 
41 
 0.01).  On the other hand, sand and quarry dust shoed no significant differences in removal of 
NH 4-N (ANOVA, F = 7.082 , d.f. = 2, p >  0.1). Sand and quarry dust showed no marked 
differences in the treatment of TSS (ANOVA, F = 4.103 , d.f. = 2, p >  0.1), while they  both 
performed better than gravel (ANOVA, F = 4.103 , d.f. = 2, p <  0.05).

The treatments A1, B1 and C1 represent sand , 16mm gravel and 8mm gravel respectively  
 
Mesocosm performance at 0.8 m depth  
Performance of 0.8 m mesocosms  (Figure 13) indicated that depth affected the removal of 
BOD, NH 4-N and TSS while COD showed no difference in treatment between the substrates 
(ANOVA, F = 0.579, d.f. = 2, p > 0.1). For BOD and TSS removal, sand outperformed both 
quarry dust and gravel, with no determinable differences between the latter two. BOD and TSS 
recorded (ANOVA, F = 4.555, d.f. = 2, p <  0.05) and (ANOVA, F = 12.38, d.f. =  2, p <  0.001) 
respectively. Gravel and quarry dust shoed no differences in performance (ANOVA, F = 32. 34, 
d.f. = 2, p >  0.1) and they both outperformed sand in the removal of NH 4-N (ANOVA, F = 
32.34, d.f. = 2, p <  0.001).

4.6 Effect of HRT on pollutant removal efficiency  
The effect of retention time on pollutant removal efficiency by all substrates was studied. 
Performance was analysed in terms of mass concentration of pollutants retained by the 
mesocosms per day. One way ANOVA was used to identify significant differences in 
performance of the mesocosms and the results tabulated in (APPENDIX 7). Visual description 
of the results was presented in (Figure 14) below.

Retention times of 3 and 5 days were observed to greatly reduce BOD 5 compared to 1 day 
retention time . There was no significant difference between 3 and 5 day  retention times 
however. Removal efficiencies for BOD 5 were in the order of 48.9%, 57.07%,  44.58%, 44%, 
51.79%  and 43.66% for treatments A1, B1, B2, A2,  C1 and C2 respectively in HRT 5. 5 day 
retention time observably achieved the best results for all pollutants , with 2mm sand at 0.8 m 
depth giving the best BOD and TSS removal . NH 4-N removal was  better in both gravel 
mesocosms and 0.8 m quar ry dust mesocosm.  Further investigation on the effect of retention 
time on individual substrate performance at both 0.65 m and 0.8 m depths was conducted and 
presented below.  
4.5.1 Performance of 2 mm sand at  0.65 m depth in pollutant removal  
The effect of retention time on remov al efficiency of 2mm sand at 0.65  m depth was 
investigated.  Results (Figure 15) indicated that retention time of 1 day produced significantly 
higher BOD 5 effluent (ANOVA, F = 55.36, d. f. = 2, p <  0.001)  than both 3 and 5 day retention 
experiments. The latter tw o retention times show ed no difference in BOD treatment (ANOVA, -20020406080

COD removal (ANOVA, F = 24.27, d.f. = 2, p < 0.001) . Also, three day retention was observed  
to perform  better than 1 day retention (ANOVA, F = 24.27, d.f. = 2, p <  0.1). NH 4-N reduction 
fluctuated with change in retention time. For HRT 3, NH 4-N was observed to increase  rather 
than decrease by up to twice the influent concentration. HRT 5 gave the best treatment results 
compared to HRT 3 (ANOVA, F = 45.71, d.f. = 2, p <  0.001)  and HRT 1 (ANOVA, F = 45.71, 
d.f. = 2, p <  0.001). TSS removal improved markedly at 5 day retention time when compared 
to 1 and 3 day retention (ANOVA, F = 9.325, d.f. = 2, p <  0.001 , p < 0.01) .  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5.2 Performance of 2 mm sand at 0.8 m depth in pollutant removal  
The effect of retention time on removal efficiency of 2mm sand at 0.8 m depth was also 
assessed and found to be similar in performance to 0.65m mesocosm s (Figure 1 5) for all but 
NH 4-N (Figure 16) . Results indicated that retention time of 1 day produced significantly higher 
BOD 5 effluent than both 3 and 5 day retention experiments  (ANOVA, F = 259, d.f. = 2, p <  
0.001) . BOD removal for HRT 3 was not so different from HRT 5 (ANOVA, F = 259, d.f. = 2, Figure 15: Pollutant removal efficiency by 2 mm sand at 0.65 m at HRT 1, 3 and 5.

(ANOVA, F = 32.34, d.f. = 2, p <  0.001) . NH 4-N reduction fluctuated with change in reten tion 
time. For HRT 3, NH 4-N was observed to increase rather than decrease by up to twice the 
influent concentration. HRT 5 gave the best treatment results compared to HRT 3 (ANOVA, F 
= 103.8, d.f. = 2, p <  0.001)  and HRT 1 (ANOVA, F = 103.8, d.f. = 2, p <  0.001). It was 
observed that performance in HRT 1 changed from NH 4 reduction as opposed to production 
noted for 0.65 mesocosm s. TSS removal improved markedly at 5 day retention time when 
compared to 1 and 3 day retention (ANOVA, F = 10.39, d.f. = 2, p <  0.01, p < 0.001).  HRT 3 
showed no difference in treatment from HRT 1 (ANOVA, F = 10.39, d.f. = 2, p >  0.1).

4.5.3 Performance of 8 mm quarry dust  at 0.65 m depth in pollutant removal  
The effect of retention time on removal efficiency of 8 mm quarry dust  at 0.65 m depth was 
studied ( Figure  17). Results indicated that both 3 and 5 day retention times produced 
significantly better BOD 5 effluent than 1  day retention time at p (ANOVA, F = 89.95, d.f. = 2, 
p < 0.000, p < 0.00 0 ). It should be noted that p < 0.000  indicates interaction of other factors 
that affects the retention time , therefore HRT  impact cannot be considered alone . COD removal 
in all the retentio n times differed significantly. One day retention gave  the best treatment results  
(ANOVA, F = 27, d.f. = 2, p <  0.001) compared to  3 day and 5 day retention , which showed 
little difference in treatment  (ANOVA, F = 27, d.f. = 2, p < 0.1). Retention time at 3 and 1 days 
showed no difference in COD treatment (ANOVA, F = 27, d.f. = 2, p >  0.1). NH 4-N removal 
was observed to be higher at 1 day retention compared to both 3 and 5 day retention (ANOVA, -150-100-50050100

 F = 8.339, d.f. = 2, p <  0.05, p < 0.001) . A different  trend was observed for TSS removal in 
which 5 day retention performed better than both 1 and 3 day retention time (ANOVA, F = 
25.79, d.f. = 2, p <  0.000). The level of significance observed,  indicated that there were other 
unknown factors that affected TS S removal aside from retention time.

4.5.4 Performance of 8 mm quarry dust at 0.8 m depth in pollutant removal  
The effect of retention time on removal efficiency of 8 mm gra vel at 0.8 m depth was studied . 
Performance was observed to follow a similar trend as in  (Figure 1 7) except for BOD 5 removal 
which was negative at HRT 1  (Figure 1 8). Results indicated that both 3 and 5 day retention 
times performed similarly (ANOVA, F = 59.85, d.f. = 2, p > 0.1) and produced significantly 
better BOD 5 effluent than 1 day retention time , (ANOVA, F = 59.85, d.f. = 2, p <  0.000 ). COD 
removal in all the ret ention times differed significantly in performance. One day retention ga ve 
the best treatment results  in comparison to HRT 3 and HRT 5. NH 4-N concentration was 
observed to vary inconsistently for the different retention times studied. Five day retention 
produced the best treatment results compared to HRT 3 and 1 (ANOVA, F = 25.79, d.f. = 2, p 0102030405060

4.5.5 Performance of 16 mm gravel at 0.65 m depth in pollutant removal  
Analysis of HRT effect on pollutant removal efficiency  by 16 mm gravel at 0 .65 m ( Figure 
19) revealed that 5 and 3 day retention gave twice as much  BOD 5 treatment as 1 day retention 
time (ANOVA, F = 61.46, d.f. = 2, p < 0.000) . One day retention time was observed to produce 
much better effluent for COD than 3 and 5 day retention (ANOVA, F = 10.63,  d.f. = 2, p <  
0.001) . NH 4-N reduction was best at 5 day retention and differed significantly from both 3 and 
1 day retention (ANOVA, F = 27.33 , d.f. = 2, p = 0.001, p < 0.000). At 3 and 1 day retention 
ammonia seemed to increase in the system rather than decrease. TSS removal was observed to 
differ between the tested retention times. Five day retention was observed to perform b est 
compared to 3 day (ANOVA, F = 21.9, d.f. = 2, p <  0.001) and 1 day retention  (ANOVA, F = 
21.9, d.f. = 2, p <  0.01). Performance at 3 days differed from that at 1 day (ANOVA, F = 21.9,

4.5.6 Performance of 16 mm gravel at 0.8 m depth in pollutant removal  
Effect of retention time on pollutant removal for 0.8 m mesocosms was assessed and found to 
be similar in trend to performance at 0.65 m (F igure 19 ) for all but NH 4-N (Figure 20) . Results 
revealed that retention time affected treatment performance of all pollutants. After close 
inspection, it was observed that there w as little  difference  in treatment performance between 
HRT 3 and 5 for BOD 5 (ANOVA, F = 230.6, d.f. = 2, p > 0.1) . Both retention times gave twice 
as much BOD 5 removal as 1 day retention (ANOVA, F = 230.6 , d.f. = 2, p <  0.000). One day 
retention gave best results for COD  removal and was markedly different in performance from 
both 3 and 5 day retention times (ANOVA, F = 32.29, d.f. = 2, p <  0.000) . HRT 5 gave better 
results for NH 4-N treatment than either 3 or 1 day retention (ANOVA, F = 30.58, d.f. = 2, p = 
0.1, p <  0.000). For TSS removal, pollutant removal was in the order of HRT 5 to 1 with 
significantly poorer performance observed in both HRT 3 and 1 (ANOVA, F = 32.29, d.f. = 2,

Characteristics of the wastewater were highly variable. Substrate type and depth were observed 
to have little impact on overall pollutant removal hence, pointing to a stronger interplay 
betwee n the microbial communities and in-situ parameters in form of  biochemical processes 
in the wastewater. Furthermore, performance of individual substrates at both 0.65 m and 0.8 m 
depth for all retention times followed a similar trend. It should be noted that the 0.8 m 
mesocosms gave sligh tly better effluent concentration in all cases except in BOD where 
shallow quarry dust did better than the deeper mesocosm. This was also the case for COD 
where shallow sand mesocosm performed best, outperforming the deeper sand mesocosm. 
Retention time wa s observed to have a significant impact on organic matter reduction but at 
the expense of ammonia increase. A negative relationship between ammonia and organic 
matter breakdown was observed. It is worth noting that, as the BOD demand decreased, 
ammonia con centration continued to increase.

 CHAPTER FIVE  
DISCUSSION  
5.1 Characteristics  of the slaughter house wastewater  and their temporal variation  
According to Del Pozo, Tas, Hakan, Orhon and Diez, (2003), i nformation on wastewater 
characteristics has been said to affect treatment plant design to a great extent . Previously, 
characterisation was based on modelling of processes within the treatment system. Recent 
studies indicate that there is a need to factor in the inter -relationship between biological, 
physical and chemical processes that steer pollutant removal processes (Del Pozo et al.,  2003; 
Metcalf and Eddy, 2003; Abdelhakeem et al.,  2015).  This is because of the high variability of 
wastewater composition (Heger, n.d) and its biodegradability index , which have been proven 
to fluctuate highly and even affect treatment ( Osorio, 2006) . The wastewater in this study was 
characterised as being of high strength. Generally wastewater is classified as being “strong”, 
where st rength is based on concentrations above those of  conventional ranges for strong 
domestic effluents . However, limited information exists on classification ranges  (Heger, n.d ).  
The concentrations of some selected physico -chemical parameters observed in this  study  were 
higher than reported ranges  for similar wastewater in other studies. Irshad et al.  (2015); Sunder, 
G. and Satyanarayan, S. (2013), recorded a range of 11 ,000 mg/L -17,000 mg/L  for BOD 5. This 
study found the BOD 5 to vary between 2,098 mg/L and 1,200 mg/L , which was much lower in 
comparison.  COD, TSS and NH 4-N on the other hand, had concentration ranges falling within 
similar characterisation studies.   
Temporal variations in influent wastewater parameters monitored over the study period showed 
statistical differences. This could be attributable to the wide range of ambient air temperature 
at the experimental site which ranged between lows of 10-12oC at night and highs of 25-27oC 
during the day. Biochemical processes are known to be subject to tem perature changes (Kadlec 
and Wallace, 2009 ; Irshad et al.,  2015 ) and as such it is reasonable  to relate the observed trend 
variations  with temperature change . Similar results were also observed by (Zhao et al. , 2004: 
Abdelhakeem et al. , 2015) . The variations in wastewater characteris tics can also occur due  to 
type and number of animals slaughtered, water used for washing of stomach contents , facility  
cleaning and efficiency of waste collection/separation . 
The pollutant characteristics were obse rved to significantly change after the ten day detention 
period. A marked drop in concentration observed for COD, TSS, NH 4-N, DO, pH and EC in 51 
 this study leads to the conclusion that  the detention  stage played  a key role in pollutant 
reduction. This high reduction efficiency could be attributable to the rapid breakdown of easily 
biodegradable matter (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003) (cited by Sun et al. , [2003 ]), therefore pointing 
to the importance of a pre -treatment s tage.  Despite that the BOD 5 /COD biodegradability ratio  
was 0.1; the high COD reduction observed in this period could be an indication of presence of 
highly reducible COD fraction.  
A look at the organic matter content in the TSS showed that it formed the larger fraction of 
solids in the raw effluent. The a verage percentage reduction of 79% achieved for COD  in the 
current study  further confirms this. Del Pozo et al.  (2003) pointed to the importance of 
differentiating COD fractions into readily biodegradable , readily hydrolysed and inert. Th at 
greatly contributed to selection of an appropriate combination of pre (anaerobic) and post 
(aerobic) treatment stages that maximised pollutant reduction in his study.  
5.2 Effect  of substrate type and depth on pollutant  removal efficiency  
Substrate type was  seen to have no impact on COD, BOD 5 and TSS removal in the wastewater  
at HRT 1 and 3 . In contrast, significant differences were observed for HRT 5. It is possible that 
effects of depth , substrate characteristics and retention time are tied together . This supposition 
is supported by the better overall performa nce of the substrate s in deeper mesocosms at 5 day 
retention . 
With regard to the impact of substrate size on OM reduction, ( Garcı́a, Vivar, Aromir  and 
Mujeriego, 2003 ) conducted a study on 3.5  mm and 10 mm substrates for 0.30  m and 0.46 m 
deep mesocosms. No marked difference was observed on the function of media size at both 
depths. Inconsistent patterns of treatment observed at the time contrast those of a similar  study 
(Garcia and Mankin, 2002)  (cited by Kad lec and Wallace, [2009]), in which fine media (19 
mm) outperformed coarse  media (38 mm). Despite that the  current study used far smaller grain 
sizes  (sand 2mm, quarry dust 8 mm and gravel 16 mm) , the similarity  of results coincide with 
those of (Garcia and Mankin, 2002)  (cited by Kad lec and Wallace, [2009]) . Caution should 
however be applied in consideration of this information due to a general knowledge gap on 
marked effects of media size in organic matter redu ction.  Further, longer term studies are 
necessary to verify observations noted in the current study.  
Langergraber  et al.  (2007) indicated that majority of microbial biomass responsible for organic 
matte r breakdown is located in the t op 20 cm layer of a wet land. He further suggested that , this 52 
 region has greater availability to hold diffuse oxygen and also that most particulate matter 
filtration occurs here. It has also been established that organic matter breakdown can occur 
unde r anaerobic conditions as we ll for high strength wastewaters (Sun et al. , 2003). The lack 
of marked differences in organic matter removal  for all retention time can therefore be 
attributed to the insignificance of depth and microbial action in the top layer of a wetland . 
Coleman et al. (2001) in a study on the importance of depth in OM removal compared shallow 
(45 cm) and deep (60 cm) beds. He found no difference in their performance at identical  
hydraulic loads thus emphasizing the insignificance of bed depth in treatment. It is pos sible 
therefore to conclude that depth makes no contribution to OM removal as observed in the 
current  study.  The insignificance of substrate -depth impact observed by ( Coleman et al. , 2001)  
and the current study could have been due to the small difference ( 15 cm) between shallow and 
deep mesocosms. If so, then the results observed in the current study are in line with findings 
by (Garcı́a, 2003 and Coleman et al. , 2001) . 
There was a significant difference observed for ammonia  reductions between 0.8 m gravel  with 
0.8 m sand, in which the latter had higher ammonia reduction a t a significance level of α < 
0.05. Based on this observation, it is presumable that ammonia removal increased  with decrease  
in substrate size. Kadlec and Wallace, (2009) suggested that thi s behaviour could be due to the 
fact that coarse media bed have lesser surface area per unit volume thereby having limited 
attachment surface for ammonia oxidizing biofilms. However, the trend  changed with increase 
in retention time, indicating interplay o f substrate and time. Perhaps the effect of time on media 
action is due to action time required by microbial and bacterial groups responsible for OM 
breakdown, which adsorb/desorb ammonia .  
5.3 Effect of HRT  on pollutant removal efficiency  
Hydraulic retent ion time is generally known to have a positive linear relationship with nutrient 
removal efficiency (Wu, Zhang, Li, Fan and Zou, 2013). The higher performance observed for 
overall pollutant removal at HRT 5 in this study is further supported by (Wu et al. , 2013). 
Perhaps the longer retention time allowed for increased contact between microbial 
communities and the wastewater . This consequently  increas ed removal efficiency of organic  
matter. On the contrary, (Zhao et al. , 2003  and Molle et al.,  2006 ) found  that the highest 
pollutant removal rates were achieved after a short saturation time . Bancolé et al.  (2003 ) 
suggested that at higher feeding frequency of small volumes greatly enhanced both OM 
breakdown and nitrification.  This would indicate  that one day re tention time  was expected to 53 
 achieve best results o n organic matter reduction. The current study  concurred with views by 
(Zhao et al. , 2003  and Bancolé et al. , 2003 ) only for COD removal. TSS and BOD which are 
also components of organic matter were found to perform better under a longer retention time 
of 5 days . Conversely, ( Sultana, M., Mourti, C., Tatoulis, T., Akratos, C., Tekerlekopouloua, 
A. and Vayenasa, D., 2015)  found COD reduction in cheese wastewater to be most efficient 
during a longer  retention time of four days.  
Nitrogen removal processes are generally known to be significantly influenced by temperature 
and dissolved oxygen rather than retention time  (Bodin, 2013) . Ammonia conve rsion is 
conventionally known to occur in three stages for biological treatment systems. These being : 
ammonification, nitrification and denitrification respectively. Organic nitrogen is first 
converted to ammoni a form, after which it is nitrified and then oxidized to nitrite and/or to 
nitrate which are transformed to nitrogen gas in the last step (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003) (cited 
by Dallago, Gomes, Mees, Assis  and Moreira, [n.d]).  It is possible that the nitrification stage 
was inefficient due to the slow gr owth rate of nitrifying bacteria, namely, ammonia and nitrate 
chemoautotrophs, which are also known to have a low oxidat ion efficiency (Laanbroek, 2002 
and Connolly et al. , 2004). So, despite the observed increase in DO recorded for 5 day retention 
time, l ow nitrification efficiency would result in the ammonia build up observed at HRT 1 and 
3 as only the ammonification step would have been achieved.  It would also explain the increase 
in ammonia observed during both 1 and 3 day HRT experiment cycles.  Raised pH (> 9.5) could 
also have facilitated volatilization process.  
It is possible that d enitrification of whatever little nitrate/nitrite produced in this study was 
most likely by anoxic heterotrophs given sufficient carbon sou rce. The carbon source was 
created by the high organic strength  of the slaughterhouse  wastewater;  a requirement to 
facilitate anoxic denitrifying environment . Bodin, (2013) reported similar results  under DO 
concentration of 1.5 -0.3 mg/L  for subsurface wetlands . Microbial consumption  of CO 2 
produced in turn raised pH to the observed ranges of 9 -9.7.  
Biomass production by OM degradation is known to immobilize ammonia  by adsorption 
process (Molle et al.,  2006) . Considering that an estimate of 0.6 g biomass is generated from 
breakdown o f 1 g BOD 5 (Cannon et al. , 2000) (cited by Sun et al. , [2005])  and that 12.4 % of 
this biomass is nitrogen, it would be safe to infer that about 0.074 g nitrogen is immobilized 
for each gram of BOD 5  degraded. It is important to note that, the immobilized ammonia is 
quickly released back into water by ammonification when the biomass decomposes. Therefore, 54 
 less than the theorised 0.074 g N would actually be produced. This phenomenon could help 
explain the better performance at five day retention . According to (Molle et al. , 2006) the 
adsorbed ammonia could be nitrified between batches given a longer feeding interval at HRT 
5, thus stabilising nitrification. A lso, Kadlec and Wallace , (2009) noted in a study on potato 
processing wastewater that, oxid ised nitrogen levels were typically low to nil in wetlands with 
high BOD concentration. This observation concurs  with the relatively low ammonia removal  
observed in the current  study  (14% -39 % NH 4-N removal) . Sun, G., Zhao, Y., and Allen, S.  
(2005) indicat ed that significant nitrification could only be possible if BOD drops to 200 mg/l 
or less and there were frequent recirculation ratios  of the wastewater. Van Oostrum, (1990) 
noted that sub surface flow systems in general had a low ammonia reduction capacit y, therefore 
the low reduction efficiencies observed for ammonia are within expected results for such a 
system.  55

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION  
6.1 CONCLUSION  
From this study, the following conclusions were drawn:  
1. Temporal variation in physi co-chemical characteristics of slaughterhouse wastewater was 
found to differ over time. As such it is reasonable to conclude that slaughterhouse 
wastewater characteristics vary over time.  
2. The small depth difference of 15 cm was insufficient to determine the  significance of 
substrate at different depth in removal of pollutants from slaughterhouse wastewater. As 
such, an in significant effect on removal efficiency of BOD and COD was observed. 
However, TSS and NH 4-N were  noted to work best  under a  combination of  small grain 
sized substrate and deeper mesocosms .   
3. Variation of retention time was verified to have a significant influence on removal 
efficiency of organic matter . Five day retention achieved the best organic matter reduction 
overall. Ammonia removal on  the contrary could not achieve significant reduction 
concentrations  due to high organic load of the wastewater .  
Although effluent concentrations were higher than the national effluent release regulations, the 
study sufficiently demonstrated the potential  of vertical sub -surface flow constructed wetlands 
in treating slaughterhouse wastewater.  
6.2 RECOMMENDATION  
1. Smaller substrate sizes  can be considered in CWs targeting organic matter. However, they 
would have a higher likelihood of fas ter clogging, thereby making a  pre-treatment stage 
necessary. Alternatively, small, frequent batches of wastewater  at short retention time  
could be applied to enhance substrate -water interactions for optimal treatment.  
2. A further analysis step to be conducted  using modelling . This will combine the significant 
factors identified for organic matter reduction into a prediction and management tool for 
slaughterhouse wastewater treatment.  
3. Ammonium nitrogen  could  be treated in a later  treatment step to achieve the o verall 
pollutant reduction target.  56 
 Suggestions for further research  
Effect of physic o-chemical parameters on pollutant removal were identified in this study but 
could not be substantiated since that  would be beyond the current study scope. Further 
investi gation of physico -chemical characteristics of slaughterhouse wastewater would benefit 
understanding of pollutant removal processes. Further, modelling as a tool could  be used to 
extract and quantify these relationships in order to obtain information on opt imal targets  of 
physical, chemical and biological processes in elimination of specific wastewater  pollutants .

 During the course of the three month study, in-situ parameters of the slaughterhouse effluent 
wastewater were monitored in addition to the parameters studied. The results were grouped 
according to retention times in the order of HRT 1, HRT 3 and HRT 5. The treatments A1, A2, 
B1, B2, C1 and C2 represented s and at 65 and 80 cm, 16mm gravel at 65 and 80 cm and 8mm 
gravel at 65 and 80 cm respectively.

Appendices  8, 9 and 10 above summarize the changes of  in-situ parameters measured for the 
different treatments over the retention times studied. ANOVA function was used to determine 
whether there were any significant differences between treatments in HRT 1, 3 and 5. DO and 
Temperature varied significantly be tween HRT 1 and 3 at p < 0.001.   
Generally, DO was observed to increase with increase in retention time from  an average of  
0.10 at HRT 1, to 0.17  at HRT 3 and 0.2 7 at HRT  5. pH was observed to be highest  (> 9.5) for 
HRT 5 as compared to HRT 1 and 3 , perhaps due  to salt by-products from microbial activity  
(Kadlec and Wallace, 2009) . Temperature decreased with in crease in retention time , possibly 
due to stability of conditions within the mesocosms from less frequent recirculation 
disturbance . Significan ce in differences observed for trends in pH, temperature and EC could 
not be determined due to possible interaction of other factors not included in the factorial 
analysis.  The use of mixed models in statistical analysis could better explain interactions 
observed between physic -chemical parameters and pollutant removal.
