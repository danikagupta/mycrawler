Black  bloom  has  an  offensive  odor  (caused  by,  e.g.,  dimethyl  sulﬁde,  DMS;  dimethyl  disulﬁde,  DMDS;
and dimethyl  trisulﬁde,  DMTS)  and  disastrous  consequences  for  natural  limnic  ecosystems  worldwide.
However, research  on  black  bloom  and  its  taste  and  odor  (T&O)  compounds  has  been  limited  by  the
difﬁculty of  predicting  the  time  and  location  of  black  bloom  events.  Therefore,  the  occurrence,  develop-
ment and  decline  of  black  bloom  and  the  dynamics  of  T&O  compounds  in  each  stage  of  black  bloom  were
examined in  Meiliang  Bay,  Lake  Taihu,  through  an  in  situ  enclosure  (2.5  m  ×  2.5  m)  simulation  experi-
ment with  various  levels  of  cyanobacterial  biomass  (0  g  m−2,  1500  g  m−2,  7500  g  m−2and  15,000  g  m−2,
fresh weight).  The  principal  odor-related  substances  and  the  physicochemical  parameters  were  analyzed
every two  or  three  days.  Black  blooms  occurred  in  the  moderate  (7500  g  m−2)  and  high  (15,000  g  m−2)
cyanobacterial biomass  treatments  concurrently  on  day  5  but  did  not  occur  in  the  low  cyanobacterial
biomass (1500  g  m−2)  treatment  or  in  the  control  group  (0  g  m−2).  Thus,  black  bloom  could  be  induced  by
the decay  of  dense  cyanobacterial  populations  under  suitable  meteorological  and  hydrographic  condi-
tions. As  the  extent  of  black  bloom  increased,  the  concentrations  of  nutrients  (e.g.,  ammonium  nitrogen
and total  phosphorus),  odorous  compounds,  and  total  divalent  anionic  sulfur  and  the  duration  of  low  dis-
solved oxygen  levels  increased,  whereas  the  pH  decreased.  In  addition,  linear  regression  analysis  revealed
that the  concentrations  of  odorous  compounds  in  the  water  column  were  signiﬁcantly  correlated  with
changes in  certain  physicochemical  parameters  (e.g.,  chlorophyll  a,  pH)  and  these  changes  were  mainly
induced by  the  breakdown  of  the  cyanobacterial  bloom.  Overall,  our  study  revealed  that  (i)  the  extent
of black  bloom  (e.g.,  level  of  black  water  color,  concentrations  of  offensive  odor  compounds  and  dura-
tion) is  strongly  inﬂuenced  by  cyanobacterial  biomass;  and  (ii)  extremely  high  concentrations  of  T&O
compounds may  originate  from  the  decomposition  of  cyanobacteria.

1.  Introduction
Black  bloom,  also  known  as  black  water  agglomerate,  is  a  serious
natural  ecosystem  disaster  that  occurs  worldwide  in  freshwater
lakes  and  along  seashores  (Berthon  and  Zibordi,  2010;  Pucciarelli
et  al.,  2008 ).  This  phenomenon  often  occurs  during  the  summer  (Lu
and  Ma,  2009 ).  Public  concern  about  black  bloom  was  triggered  by
the  recent  potable  water  crisis  in  the  city  of  Wuxi.  A  black  color  and
a  strong  offensive  odor  are  the  two  most  characteristic  features  of

can  lead  to  worse  economic  losses  (Freuze  et  al.,  2004 ).  However,
research  on  black  bloom  and  its  associated  taste  and  odor  (T&O)
compounds  has  been  limited  by  the  difﬁculty  of  predicting  the  time
and  location  of  black  bloom  events  (He  et  al.,  2013 ).
Studies  have  suggested  that  /H9252-cyclocitral,  /H9252-ionone  and  volatile
organic  sulfur  compounds  (VOSCs),  such  as  dimethyl  sulﬁde  (DMS),
dimethyl  disulﬁde  (DMDS)  and  dimethyl  trisulﬁde  (DMTS),  are  the
major  compounds  responsible  for  the  strong  offensive  odor  of  black
bloom  (Duval  and  Ludlam,  2001;  Shen  et  al.,  2014 ).  Zhang  et  al.
(2010)  reported  that  DMS,  DMDS,  DMTS  and  /H9252-cyclocitral  reached
the  notably  high  concentrations  of  93.9,  46.1,  17.2  and  21.0  /H9262g  L−1,
respectively,  during  the  water  crisis  in  Wuxi  City,  and  Yang  et  al.

Fig.  1.  The  black  bloom  that  occurred  in  Lake  Taihu.
(2008)  reported that DMTS reached  11.7  and  1.8  /H9262g  L−1at  two  sep-
arate sampling  sites  on  another  sampling  day.  Additionally,  a  high
concentration of DMS  was  also  detected  in  black  bloom  induced  by
submerged  plants  (Shen  et  al.,  2014 ).  However,  these  reports  were
based  on casual ﬁeld follow-up  investigations  without  continuous
monitoring. Little  is  known  about  the  dynamics  of  T&O  compounds
during the entire  black  bloom  process.
Black  bloom  may  be  induced  by  algal  blooms  (Lu  and  Ma,  2009 ).
Ma  et al. (2013)  showed  that  the  decay  of  cyanobacterial  blooms
could  induce  anoxic  water  conditions,  decrease  pH,  and  increase
nutrient  loading  in  the  lake  water.  The  water  in  the  enclosures  was
black  and  malodorous.  Moreover,  DMS,  DMTS  and  /H9252-cyclocitral
simultaneously  reached  extremely  high  levels,  with  maxima  of
62.33,  12.41  and  1.37  /H9262g  L−1,  respectively.  Liu  et  al.  (2015)  sug-
gested that  sediment  dredging  at  an  appropriate  depth  could
suppress  the  occurrence  of  black  bloom  but  could  not  suppress  the
offensive  odor.  Feng  et  al.  (2014)  suggested  that  sulﬁde-reducing
bacteria  (SRB)  and  protein  are  the  principal  biological  and  organic
factors,  respectively,  that  contribute  to  the  occurrence  of  black
bloom.  Most  studies  have  primarily  focused  on  the  mechanism  of
black  bloom  occurrence.  However,  the  development  and  decline  of
black  bloom  and  the  related  T&O  compounds  in  each  stage  remain
unclear.  Furthermore,  little  is  known  about  how  cyanobacterial
biomass  affects  black  bloom  and  T&O  compounds.
The  present  study  sought  to  address  these  knowledge  gaps  by
conducting  black  bloom  simulation  experiments  in  Meiliang  Bay,
Lake  Taihu,  China,  using  various  levels  of  cyanobacterial  biomass.
The  dynamics  of  the  T&O  compounds,  as  well  as  those  of  water
quality parameters,  were  continuously  monitored  in  all  enclosures
until  the  black  bloom  disappeared.  We  also  compared  these  ﬁnd-
ings  to  results  that  were  previously  collected  from  a  natural  black
bloom  (Fig.  1)  in  the  mid-  to  late  stage  in  June  2013  in  Gonghu
Bay,  Lake  Taihu.  Fortunately,  the  development  and  decline  of  black
bloom  and  the  related  T&O  compounds  in  the  in  situ  simulation
experiment  were  consistent  with  the  survey  results  from  the  natu-
ral  black  bloom.  These  results  provide  new  insights  that  may  help
clarify  the  relationship  between  T&O  compounds  and  factors  rele-
vant  for  better  incident  prediction,  warning  and  prevention  in  the
future.
2.  Materials  and  methods
2.1. Study  site
Lake  Taihu  (30◦55/prime40/prime/prime-31◦32/prime58/prime/primeN,  119◦52/prime32/prime/prime-120◦36/prime10/prime/primeE),
the third  largest  freshwater  lake  in  China,  is  a  typical  large  and
shallow  eutrophic  subtropical  lake  (surface  area:  2338  km2,  meandepth:  1.9  m).  Many  serious  black  bloom  incidents  have  recently
occurred  in  Lake  Taihu,  particularly  along  the  western  and  north-
ern  shorelines  (Duan  et  al.,  2014 ).  In  Meiliang  Bay,  in  the  northern
part  of  Lake  Taihu,  enclosures  have  been  deployed  approximately
200  m  away  from  the  eastern  shoreline.  As  a  result  of  nutrient  pol-
lution,  Meiliang  Bay  is  eutrophic  and  experiences  intensive  blooms
of  algae  (mostly  cyanobacteria)  during  summer  (Tang  et  al.,  2014 ).
2.2.  Experimental  design
Twelve  enclosures  (2.5  m  ×  2.5  m)  were  constructed  from
waterproof  polyvinyl  chloride.  The  enclosures  were  open  to  the
atmosphere  and  to  the  bottom  sediment  and  were  supported  by
four  rigid  horizontal  hoops.  The  mean  water  depth  in  all  enclosures
was  approximately  1.5  m.  To  prevent  waves  and  rising  water  from
entering,  the  enclosure  walls  were  extended  approximately  1  m
above  the  mean  water  level.  To  minimize  the  artiﬁcial  disturbances
of  the enclosure construction,  the  enclosures  were  left  untreated
for  two  weeks  before  the  addition  of  cyanobacteria.  Samples  were
collected from each  enclosure  on  July  31,  2014,  one  day  before
adding  cyanobacteria  as  a  reference.  The  bloom  cyanobacteria  used
in this work  were  collected  from  a  cove  on  Meiliang  Bay.  The  fresh
cyanobacteria  were  centrifuged  at  1500  r/min  for  5  min,  yielding  a
water content of  approximately  65%,  calculated  according  to  previ-
ously  reported  methods  (Liu  et  al.,  2010 ).  The  cyanobacteria  were
alive  when  they  were  added  to  the  enclosures.  Four  treatments  with
different  levels  of  cyanobacterial  biomass  were  applied:  control
(0  g  m−2,  C),  low  cyanobacterial  biomass  (1500  g  m−2,  L),  moderate
cyanobacterial  biomass  (7500  g  m−2,  M),  and  high  cyanobacterial
biomass  (15,000  g  m−2,  H).  Each  treatment  was  performed  in  tripli-
cate.  Immediately  after  the  addition  of  the  cyanobacteria,  the  water
in  the  enclosures  was  mixed  by  stirring  with  an  oar.  Experiments
were  terminated  when  the  water  column  became  colorless  in  all
enclosures.  Samples  were  collected  every  two  or  three  days  based
on  the  changes  in  water  quality  parameters  during  the  study  period,
beginning  on  day  1  (1  August,  2014).
2.3.  Sampling  and  analyses
Samples  were  obtained  between  10:00  AM  and  1:00  PM  at  a
single  depth  (0.5  m  below  the  water  surface)  in  the  center  of  each
enclosure.  Samples  for  the  analysis  of  total  divalent  anionic  sul-
fur  (/summationtext
S2−)  were  immediately  transferred  into  bottles  containing
zinc  acetate  to  prevent  oxidation.  Samples  for  evaluating  T&O  com-
pounds  and  inorganic  nutrients  were  collected  in  1-L  narrow-neck
PE  bottles  with  no  headspace  and  stored  immediately  in  a  portable
refrigerator  at  approximately  4◦C  before  transport  to  the  labora-
tory.  Upon  arrival  in  the  laboratory,  all  samples  for  the  analysis  of
off-ﬂavor  were  stored  at  −20◦C  for  no  more  than  5  days  before
analysis.
Water  temperature,  dissolved  oxygen  (DO),  pH  and  total
dissolved  solid  (TDS)  were  measured  in  situ  using  a  HORIBA
water  quality  monitor  (HORIBA,  Ltd.  Kyoto  Japan).  Total  nitrogen
(TN),  ammonium  nitrogen  (NH 4-N),  total  phosphorus  (TP),/summationtext
S2−
(/Sigma1S2−=  H2S  +  HS−+  S2−)  and  chlorophyll  a  were  analyzed  accord-
ing  to  standard  methods  (Jin  and  Tu,  1990 ).
To  estimate  the  T&O  compounds,  a  300-mL  water  sample  was
ﬁltered  through  a  Whatman  GF/C  ﬁberglass  ﬁlter.  The  ﬁltrate  was
analyzed  for  dissolved  T&O  compounds  in  water.  The  T&O  com-
pounds  were  analyzed  with  a  P&T  extraction  device  coupled  with
GC–MS  according  to  Chen  et  al.  (2010a)  and  Deng  et  al.  (2011) .
2.4. Statistical  analysis
Correlations between  water  quality  variables  and  T&O  com-
pounds  were  identiﬁed  using  Pearson’s  correlation  coefﬁcient248  D.  Yu  et  al.  /  Ecological  Engineering  87  (2016)  246–253
method  implemented  with  SPSS  19.0  software.  All  data  except  pH
were  log( x  +  1)  transformed  to  meet  homogeneity  and  normaliza-
tion  (He  et  al.,  2015 ).  Signiﬁcance  levels  are  marked  as  *  (signiﬁcant,
0.01  <  p  <  0.05)  or  **  (highly  signiﬁcant,  p  <  0.01).  All  graphs  were
plotted  using  Origin  8.5  software.
3.  Results
3.1.  Black  bloom  proﬁle
Microscopic  determination  revealed  that  the  cyanobacteria
Microcystis  spp .  accounted  for  more  than  95%  of  the  total  phyto-
plankton  used  in  the  present  study.  No  signiﬁcant  differences  in
water  quality  parameters  (e.g.,  TN,  chlorophyll  a  and  DO)  and  T&O
compounds  (e.g.,  DMS  and  DMTS)  were  observed  among  the  twelve
enclosures  prior  to  the  addition  of  cyanobacteria  (p  >  0.05).  The
salient features  of  algae-caused  black  bloom  are  the  black  color  and
the  odor of the water.  However,  odor  alone  is  not  sufﬁcient  to  iden-
tify a  black  bloom  because  the  causes  of  odors  in  natural  waters  are
complicated  and diverse. Therefore,  the  beginning  and  end  of  black
bloom  were  deﬁned  as  the  appearance  and  disappearance  of  light
black  color. Previous studies  described  a  classiﬁcation  method  that
deﬁned  artiﬁcial  levels  to  describe  the  water  color  (He  et  al.,  2013;
Rusch  et  al.,  1998 ).  In  the  present  study,  the  water  color  observed
in  our  experiment  was  classiﬁed  according  to  5  levels,  0,  1,  2,  3
and  4,  corresponding  to  colorless,  gray,  light  black,  black,  and  deep
black,  respectively.  In  groups  C  and  L,  the  water  remained  colorless
or  gray  throughout  the  study.  Black  bloom  concurrently  occurred
on  day  5  (level  2)  and  then  disappeared  after  day  18  and  day  24
in  groups  M  and  H,  respectively.  In  addition,  the  level  of  the  black
color  was  deeper  in  group  H  than  group  M  during  the  early  stage
of  the  experiment  (Table  1).
3.2.  Changes  in  chemical  and  physical  water  quality  parameters
The  mean  water  temperature  was  approximately  26.1–33.6◦C
in  all  enclosures.  Due  to  the  addition  of  fresh  cyanobacteria,  the
chlorophyll  a  concentrations  reached  extremely  high  levels  (1.28,
4.04 and  4.90  mg  L−1in  L,  M  and  H,  respectively)  in  those  treat-
ments,  followed  by  a  sharp  decrease  within  a  few  days.  TDS
increased  with  increasing  cyanobacterial  biomass.  The  maximum
TDS  values  reached  0.344,  0.439  and  0.560  mg  L−1concurrently  on
day  7  in  groups  L,  M  and  H,  respectively  (Table  2).
Extremely  low  DO  in  the  water  column  is  another  obvious  fea-
ture  of  black  bloom.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2A,  DO  decreased  abruptly
to  zero  on  day  1  in  M  and  H  groups  and  on  day  3  in  group  L,  after
which  it  remained  at  zero  concentration.  With  the  addition  of  more
cyanobacterial  biomass,  extremely  low  DO  was  observed  for  longer
periods  of  time.  By  contrast,  the  DO  remained  at  a  relatively  high
level  in  group  C.  The  addition  of  greater  cyanobacterial  biomass  was
associated  with  lower  pH  (Fig.  2B);  the  pH  values  in  group  C  never
fell  below  7.3.  However,  in  the  treatment  groups,  pH  decreased
sharply  after  the  addition  of  cyanobacteria,  with  the  minimum  val-
ues  concurrently  observed  on  day  5  followed  by  gradual  increases.
As  shown  in  Fig.  2C,  the  concentrations  of/summationtext
S2−remained  low
and  never  exceeded  0.4  mg  L−1in  group  C.  However,  the  values  in
groups  L,  M  and  H  peaked  at  0.86,  9.9  and  12.2  mg  L−1on  day  7
after  a  sharp  increase  and  were  nearly  100-,  1100-  and  1400-fold
greater,  respectively,  than  that  of  group  C  at  the  same  time  point.
Then,  the  concentrations  declined  steadily  until  day  27  and  then
remained  at  a  low  level.
The  changes  in  TN,  TP  and  NH 4-N  are  illustrated  in  Fig.  3.  The
initial  increases  in  TN  and  TP  were  mainly  due  to  the  addition  of
fresh cyanobacteria.  The  concentrations  of  TN  and  TP  peaked  on  day
3  and  then  gradually  declined  to  low  levels  in  all  treatment  groups.

 biomass;  H:  high  cyanobacteria  biomass.
All  groups  had  similar  low  concentrations  of  NH 4-N  on  day  1.  How-
ever,  after  a  sudden  increase,  the  NH 4-N  concentrations  peaked  on
day  9  in  groups  M  and  H,  reaching  16.6  and  37.0  mg  L−1,  respec-
tively,  nearly  53  and  119  times  the  level  in  group  C  at  the  sameD. Yu  et  al.  /  Ecological  Engineering  87  (2016)  246–253  249

remained  relatively  low  and  constant  in  the  control  treatment.
3.3. Dynamics  of  taste  and  odor  compounds
The  changes  in  the  T&O  compounds  over  time  in  the  differ-
ent  cyanobacterial  biomass  treatment  groups  are  presented  in
Fig. 4.  DMS,  DMDS  and  DMTS  followed  similar  trends.  The  con-
centrations  of  DMS,  DMDS  and  DMTS  simultaneously  reached
extremely  high  levels  on  day  7  after  a  sharp  increase  in  the  early
period  of  the  experiment.  In  addition,  the  maximal  values  reached
44.7,  78.8,  and  96.4  /H9262g  L−1for  DMS;  4.5,  18.4,  and  27.8  /H9262g  L−1for
DMDS;  and  6.5,  36.3,  and  51.3  /H9262g  L−1for  DMTS  in  groups  L,  M
and  H,  respectively.  The  highest  concentrations  of  /H9252-cyclocitral
and  /H9252-ionone  in  the  treatment  groups  (6.6,  85.8,  144.6  for  /H9252-
cyclocitral;  and  0.2,  1.2,  2.1  /H9262g  L−1for  /H9252-ionone  in  groups  L,  M  andH,  respectively)  occurred  simultaneously  on  day  3.  These  values  far
exceeded  their  olfactory  threshold  concentrations.  Then,  these  con-
centrations  gradually  decreased  until  the  end  of  the  experiment.
However,  in  group  C,  concentrations  of  these  T&O  compounds
remained  low  and  relatively  stable.  In  addition,  the  concentrations
of  these  T&O  compounds  increased  with  increasing  cyanobacterial
biomass.
3.4.  The  relationships  between  taste  and  odor  compounds  and
changes  in  the  aquatic  environment
Generally,  no  signiﬁcant  correlations  (e.g.,  NH 4-N  and  /Sigma1S2−)
or  signiﬁcant  correlations  with  a  low  r2(e.g.,  TP  and  DO)  were
observed  for  T&O  compounds  release  and  water  quality  parameters
in  group  C  (Table  3).  By  contrast,  highly  signiﬁcant  (p  <  0.01)  posi-
tive  correlations  were  observed  between  T&O  compounds  release

for  certain  water  quality  parameters  (TN,  /Sigma1S2−and  pH)  at  higher

4.  Discussion
4.1.  Black  bloom  is  affected  by  cyanobacterial  biomass
In  this  study,  an  experiment  was  designed  to  study  the  occur-
rence,  development  and  decline  of  black  bloom  and  the  variation
in  related  T&O  compounds  during  each  stage.  Our  results  demon-
strated  that  black  bloom  can  be  induced  by  a  dense  cyanobacterial
bloom.  The  only  apparent  difference  among  the  four  groups  at
beginning  of  the  experiment  was  the  cyanobacterial  biomass.  How-
ever,  black  blooms  occurred  in  groups  M  and  H,  but  not  in  groups  L
and  C,  indicating  that  the  occurrence  of  black  bloom  was  dependent
on  the addition of  cyanobacterial  biomass  under  suitable  meteo-
rological  and  hydrographic  conditions.  The  rapid  decay  of  dense
cyanobacterial biomass can  produce  extremely  low  DO  level,  high
nutrient  release  (Diaz  and  Rosenberg,  2008;  He  et  al.,  2009 )  and
favorable concentrations of  other  factors,  resulting  in  the  occur-
rence  of  black  bloom.
Our study indicated  that  the  level  of  black  bloom  was  signiﬁ-
cantly  affected  by  the  cyanobacterial  biomass.  The  water  color  was
deeper  in  group  H  than  in  group  M  during  the  early  stages  of  the
experiment,  indicating  that  the  black  bloom  was  more  severe  in
group  H.  Aqueous  sulﬁdes  promote  metal  sulﬁde  production,  and
the  key  factor  responsible  for  the  black  color  in  natural  waters  is
metal  sulﬁdes  (particularly  FeS)  (Duval  and  Ludlam,  2001;  Stahl,
1979 ).  Signiﬁcantly  higher  concentrations  of  /Sigma1S2−were  observed
as  the  cyanobacterial  biomass  in  the  water  increased  (Fig.  2C)  in
present  study.  Thus,  a  higher  cyanobacterial  biomass  would  cause
the  accumulation  of  more  metal  sulﬁdes,  thereby  darkening  the
water  color.  In  addition,  black  blooms  are  always  accompanied  by
low  DO,  low  pH,  and  a  high  concentration  of  nutrients  (e.g.,  NH 4-N
and  TP).  Thus,  the  severity  of  a  black  bloom  could  be  indicated  by  the
levels  of  these  parameters.  In  this  study,  a  lower  pH  and  higher  con-
centrations  of  nutrients  (i.e.,  TN,  TP  and  NH 4-N)  (Figs.  2  and  3)  were
observed as  the  cyanobacterial  biomass  increased,  consistent  with
the  results  of  many  studies  of  the  process  of  cyanobacterial  decay
(Chuai  et  al.,  2011 ).  This  result  is  an  indirect  indication  that  the
severity  of  black  blooms  may  increase  with  higher  cyanobacterial
biomass.
In addition,  our  results  indicated  that  the  time  of  occurrence  of
black  bloom  was  not  affected  by  the  cyanobacterial  biomass.  Black
blooms  were  observed  on  day  5  in  groups  M  and  H.  Minimum  val-
ues  of  pH  and  maximum  concentrations  of  nutrients  and  /Sigma1S2−were
observed  on  the  same  day  in  all  cyanobacterial  treatments,  suggest-
ing  that  a  dense  cyanobacteria  load  is  essential  for  the  occurrence
of  black  bloom  but  that  the  timing  of  black  bloom  is  related  to  as  yet
unidentiﬁed  factors,  such  as  the  bacterial  community  composition
and  abundance  (Feng  et  al.,  2014;  Li  et  al.,  2011 ).
However,  the  decline  of  black  bloom  was  delayed  with  higher
cyanobacterial  biomass.  In  this  study,  the  black  bloom  was  sus-
tained  for  14  and  20  days  in  groups  M  and  H,  respectively.  Moreover,
a  longer  duration  of  low  DO  and  high  concentrations  of  NH 4-N
and  /Sigma1S2−were  also  observed  in  enclosures  with  higher  cyanobac-
terial  biomass.  This  relationship  may  be  explained  as  follows.
The  addition  of  more  cyanobacteria  induced  the  accumulation
of  more  cyanobacteria  on  the  water  surface.  Thus,  the  organic
matter  in  the  water  column  would  be  constantly  replenished  as
surface  cyanobacteria  were  added  until  no  more  cyanobacteria
accumulated  on  the  water  surface.  In  addition,  under  the  same
meteorological and  hydrographic  conditions,  reducing  a  higher
concentration  of  organic  matter  to  a  speciﬁed  lower  level  requiresD.  Yu  et  al.  /  Ecological  Engineering  87  (2016)  246–253  251

additional time (Kirchman  et  al.,  1991 ).  Thus,  the  duration  of  black
bloom  is  obviously  affected  by  the  cyanobacterial  biomass.
4.2.  Dynamics  of  taste  and  odor  compounds  in  black  bloom
A  strong  offensive  odor  is  one  of  the  two  deﬁnitive  characteris-
tics  of  black  bloom  (Zhou  et  al.,  2015 ).  Our  results  indicated  that  the
concentrations  of  T&O  compounds  (e.g.,  DMS,  DMDS  and  DMTS)
were  correlated  with  the  severity  of  black  bloom.  Certain  water
quality  parameters  (e.g.,  pH,  TN  and  NH 4-N)  could  indicate  the
severity  of  black  bloom,  as  discussed  above.  In  this  study,  regression
analysis demonstrated  that  T&O  compounds  were  highly  correlated
with  certain  water  quality  parameters  (e.g.,  TN,  pH  and  /Sigma1S2−)  in
groups  M  and  H,  which  exhibited  black  bloom.  These  strong  rela-
tionships  are  also  supported  by  several  previous  studies  (Downing
et  al.,  2010 ;  Qi  et  al.,  2012 ).  In  addition,  the  absolute  value  of  r2was
generally  higher  in  group  H  than  in  group  M.  These  results  indi-
rectly  suggest  that  T&O  compounds  are  strongly  correlated  with
black  bloom.
In  addition,  our  results  indicated  that  the  variations  in  the  T&O
compounds  were  consistent  with  the  variation  in  the  black  bloom.
In  this  study,  the  extent  of  the  black  bloom  initially  increased
rapidly  and  then  progressively  declined  in  the  middle  to  late  stages
of  the  experiment.  The  concentrations  of  T&O  compounds  exhibited
a  similar  pattern  of  variation,  with  a  considerable  increase  during
the  early  stages  followed  by  a  gradual  decrease.  Moreover,  simi-
lar  variations  could  be  further  conﬁrmed  by  the  highly  signiﬁcantcorrelations (p <  0.01)  between  the  T&O  compounds  and  cer-
tain  water  quality  parameters  (Table  3).  These  variations  can  be
explained  as  follows.  For  the  VOSCs,  stored  dimethylsulfoniopro-
pionate  (DMSP)  in  the  algal  cells  could  ﬁrst  be  released  into  the
ambient  water  column  during  the  massive  and  rapid  anaerobic
algal  decay  (Ginzburg  et  al.,  1998 ).  Then,  DMSP  could  lead  to
a  rapid  increase  in  DMS  production  by  other  microbes  and  via
physicochemical  degradation  (Li  et  al.,  2011 ).  Second,  microbial
degradation of  sulfur-containing  organic  compounds  is  another
important  mechanism  of  VOSC  production  (Drotar  et  al.,  1987 ).
The  wild  algae  in  this  study  were  collected  from  Meiliang  Bay  in
Lake  Taihu,  where  crude  protein  accounts  for  more  than  40%  of
the  cyanobacterial  dry  weight  (Fan,  1999;  Villacorte  et  al.,  2015 ).
Sulfur-containing  amino  acids  (i.e.,  methionine  and  cysteine)  can
provide  copious  available  sulfur  for  SRB  (Lu  et  al.,  2013 )  and  com-
pensate  for  the  lack  of  available  sulfur  in  lake  sediments.
As  for  /H9252-cyclocitral  and  /H9252-ionone,  which  have  been  identiﬁed  as
metabolites  of  Microcystis  spp.  (Watson,  2003;  Watson  et  al.,  2008 ),
both  can  be  released  during  the  growth  of  Microcystis  spp.  and  by
the  disruption  of  their  cellular  integrity  (Suurnakki  et  al.,  2015 ).  In
addition,  because  /H9252-cyclocitral  has  lytic  activity  against  cyanobac-
teria  (Arii  et  al.,  2015 ),  a  high  concentration  of  /H9252-cyclocitral  would
accelerate  the  decomposition  of  the  cyanobacteria  in  the  bloom,
further  increasing  the  release  of  /H9252-cyclocitral  and  VOSCs.
In  this  study,  the  concentrations  of  these  ﬁve  T&O  compounds
in  all  of  the  cyanobacterial  treatments  far  exceeded  their  OTCs.
The  water  samples  from  all  of  these  columns  emitted  a  strong252  D.  Yu  et  al.  /  Ecological  Engineering  87  (2016)  246–253
offensive  odor,  while  the  water  column  in  the  control  group  was
odorless  throughout  the  simulation.  Moreover,  high  correlations
were  observed  between  T&O  compounds  and  certain  water  quality
parameters  (e.g.,  TN,  pH  and  /Sigma1S2−)  (Table  3)  in  all  cyanobacterial
treatments.  These  changes  in  chemical  parameters  were  mainly
induced  by  the  decay  of  Microcystis  (Chen  et  al.,  2010b ).  Therefore,
the  decomposition  of  massive  cyanobacterial  blooms  may  be  the
primary  source  of  the  high  concentrations  of  T&O  compounds.
4.3. Field  veriﬁcation
In  June 2013, we encountered a  mid-  to late-stage black  bloom
along the  north  shore of Gonghu  Bay,  Lake  Taihu, that lasted
approximately ten days  with  a maximum area of approximately
4.0 km2. The  strong  offensive odor was  apparent  in  a  village  near
the shore.  There  was  an  obvious  boundary  line  between  the  black
bloom  area  and  the  normal  area  (Fig.  1).  Large  amounts  of  gas
bubbled  up  continuously,  and  dead  ﬁsh  were  observed  in  the
black  bloom  area.  In  the  black  bloom  area,  the  DO  concentration
in  the  water  column  was  less  than  1  mg  L−1,  and  this  concentra-
tion  persisted  for  at  least  six  days.  The  major  T&O  compounds
were dissolved  DMS,  DMDS,  DMTS,  and  /H9252-cyclocitral,  with  max-
imum  values  of  165.8,  25.5,  4.5  and  6.5  /H9262g  L−1,  respectively,  on  21
June.  These  contaminants  declined  considerably  over  a  few  days.  In
addition,  the  concentrations  of  TN,  TP  and  NH 4-N  were  obviously
higher  in  the  black  bloom  area  than  in  the  normal  area,  whereas
the  pH  was  lower  in  the  black  bloom  area  than  in  the  normal  area
(Fig.  1S).  The  similar  patterns  of  variation  of  the  characteristic  phys-
ical  and  chemical  parameters  and  the  concentrations  of  the  major
T&O  compounds  suggest  that  the  results  of  the  present  simulation
experiment  will  have  practical  value  for  the  water  resource  man-
agers  of  Taihu  Lake  in  evaluating  the  probability  of  black  bloom
incidents.
5.  Conclusions
This study  was  designed  to  investigate  the  occurrence,  devel-
opment  and  decline  of  a  black  bloom  and  the  dynamics  of  T&O
compounds  during  each  stage  of  a  black  bloom.  The  black  bloom
was  strongly  affected  by  the  cyanobacterial  biomass.  Although  the
time  of  the  initial  occurrence  of  black  bloom  was  only  slightly
affected  by  the  cyanobacterial  biomass,  the  length  of  the  black
bloom  event  increased  with  higher  cyanobacterial  biomass.  Fur-
thermore,  our  results  indicated  that  the  concentrations  of  T&O
compounds were  closely  correlated  with  the  level  of  the  black
bloom,  and  the  concentrations  of  these  odorous  compounds  rapidly
increased  and  peaked  in  the  early  stages,  then  gradually  declined.
These  patterns  of  variation  were  very  similar  to  those  observed  in
a  natural  black  bloom.  The  primary  source  of  the  extremely  high
concentrations  of  T&O  compounds  is  likely  the  decomposition  of
the  dense  cyanobacterial  bloom.
