abstract
Solid-phase denitrification systems using biodegradable polymers are promising for wastewater 
treatment; however, little is known about the relationship between microbial communities and 
effluent quality in these systems. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a poly(3-hy-droxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV)-supported denitrification system in the treatment of 
wastewater with high nitrate concentrations with respect to the microbial community structure and 
dominant bacteria. An average denitrification rate of 1.11 g/(L d) could be achieved at an influent 
NO
3––N concentration of 80 mg/L and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1.5 h. Compared to the 
HRT, the influent NO3––N concentration had a greater effect on the denitrification efficiency at the 
same NO3––N loading rate (NLR). Microbial community analysis using Miseq Illumina sequencing 
showed that the genera Diaphorobacter and Dechloromonas were predominant. The nitrate removal 
efficiency was positively correlated with the Dechloromonas abundance, and the NLR was nega-
tively correlated with Diaphorobacter. Heatmap analysis showed that the denitrification function 
dominated over all stages, which may explain the good performance of the PHBV-supported denitrification system. These findings clarify the effect of the influent nitrate load on microbial functional abundance and community structure as well as the molecular determinants of sol-
id-phase denitrification efficiency.

1. Introduction
Biological nitrate removal is widely applied for waste-
water treatment owing to its low cost and high efficiency. 
During the biological denitrification process, organic car -
bon is used as an electron donor by heterotrophic micro-organisms [1]. External organic carbon should be added during the process, especially when treating wastewater with a low C/N ratio, such as groundwater, and during tertiary nitrogen removal from wastewater treatment plants [2,3]. Insufficient dosing or overdosing of conventional sol-uble carbon sources, such as methanol, ethanol, sodium acetate, and glucose, can lead to the deterioration of efflu-ent quality. In addition, soluble carbon sources pose safety risks owing to their toxicity and flammability during stor -
age, transportation, and operation [4]. To overcome these issues, insoluble biodegradable polymers have recently been used as carbon sources and biofilm carriers in the bio-logical denitrification of wastewater, known as solid-phase S. Zhang et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 215 (2021) 23–30 24
denitrification (SPD) [5,6]. SPD enables the simple control 
and supervision of the process [7] and is therefore widely used for nitrate removal.
Within the SPD system, two processes occur: hydroly-
sis and denitrification. The hydrolysis of the solid carbon source by extracellular enzymes excreted by degrad-ing microorganisms is the first and most important step, followed by the use of the degradation products by denitri-fying bacteria [8]. Previous studies have identified vari-ous microorganisms such as Thauera, Dechloromonas, and 
Clostridium, which play roles in degradation and denitri-fication during the SPD processing of poly(3-hydroxy-butyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)/poly(lactic acid) (PHBV/PLA) and PHBV biofilms [8,9]. These bacteria can utilize carbohydrates or mono-aromatic compounds and bio-degradable polymers completely as carbon and energy sources for denitrification to produce N
2 and volatile fatty 
acids such as acetate, butyrate, and butanol [10,11]. These bacteria commonly occupy a dominant position in the sys-tem to promote biological denitrification. The microbial community structure is greatly affected by external envi-ronmental conditions such as temperature and salinity. For example, Thauera, Nitrospira, Arenimonas, and Dechloromonas  
biofilms are rarely found in SPD biofilters; nevertheless, they become dominant in low-temperature environments [12]. However, the relationship between bacterial commu-nities in the SPD system and effluent quality has rarely been reported, despite being significant for controlling the nitrogen removal efficiency in water treatment.
In this study, we used PHBVs as biofilm carriers and car -
bon sources in an SPD system. The objectives of the study were to (1) evaluate the denitrification performance of the system, (2) characterize microbial diversity under different operational conditions by high-throughput sequencing, and (3) explore the relationship between the microbial commu-nity structure and denitrification performance of the sys-tem. The microflora structure of the reactor is regulated by changes in water quality parameters, thereby influencing operating efficiency. Our results provide a comprehen-sive basis for understanding the microbial community structure in the SPD process.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Biodegradable PHBV granules were purchased from 
Ningbo Biologic Material Co., Ltd., (Zhejiang, China). 
The physical characteristics of the PHBV granules were as follows: diameter, 3 mm; height, 2–3 mm; surface area 
0.015 m
2/g; and density, 1.25 kg/L.
To represent wastewater with a low C/N ratio, synthetic 
wastewater was prepared by adding NaNO3 and KH2PO4 to 
tap water. The seed for denitrification was activated sludge collected from an anaerobic treatment tank in the munic-ipal wastewater treatment plant. The sludge contained 
3,450 mg/L mixed liquid-suspended solids and 2,910 mg/L 
volatile suspended solids, and the sludge-settling percent-
age was 30%.
2.2. Experimental setup
This study employed an up-flow fixed-bed reactor 
filled with PHBV granules (350 g) made from the 50-mm-  
inner diameter and 600-mm-high cylindrical Plexiglas. 
The reactor had an effective volume of 0.75 L (Fig. S1). 
The synthetic wastewater containing activated sludge was pumped into the bottom of the reactor by a peristal-tic pump at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min hydraulic retention 
time (HRT ≈ 6.5 h) at the domestication stage. The steady-
state of the bioreactor was regarded as the point at which fluctuations in the removal of nitrate were ±5% for 5 d. 
After stable denitrification was obtained, the flow rate and influent nitrate concentration were increased step-wise to evaluate the effect of the nitrate loading rates. The PHBV denitrification system operations are summarized in Table 1. The temperature of the reactor was 25°C ± 1°C, 
and the pH was maintained at 7.0–7.3. Samples were taken from the effluent to monitor NO
3––N, NO2––N, NH4+–N, and 
dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
2.3. Water quality analytical methods
The influent and effluent of the reactor were collected 
and analyzed daily. Before the analysis, the water samples 
were filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane. NO3––N, NO2––N, 
and NH4+–N were measured by ultraviolet spectrophoto-
metry, N-(1-naphthalene)-diaminoethane spectrophotom-
etry, and Nessler’s reagent spectrophotometry, respectively, in accordance with the methods described by Zhang et al. [4]. DOC was measured using a TOC analyzer (Element, Berlin, Germany) through combustion oxidation-non-dispersive infrared absorption.
2.4. Microbial community analysis
Attached biofilm samples were collected by ultra-
sonic treatment (Shumei, Kunshan, China) from the PHBV

granules of the reactor on days 30, 61, 81, and 105. PowerSoil 
DNA Isolation Kits (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, 
USA) were used to extract DNA from the biofilm samples. 
The DNA quality was visualized on TAE agarose gels. The 
quantity and yield were checked using a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, 
USA) to make sure the DNA concentration was >20 ng/μL. 
Primers 338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 
806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′) were used 
to amplify the V4–V5 regions of the bacterial genome. The reaction system and procedures for PCR amplification are 
detailed in the Supplementary Material (Tables S1 and S2).
The DNA samples were sent to Novogene Biotechnology 
Co., Ltd., (Beijing, China) for Illumina high-through-
put sequencing using the HiSeq 2500 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed using 
a 2 × 250 paired-end (PE) configuration, and low-quality 
sequences were removed. Operational taxonomic units 
(OTUs) were clustered using a 97% similarity cut-off using 
UPARSE (version 7.1 http://drive5.com/uparse/), and chimeric sequences were identified and removed using 
UCHIME. Taxonomic assignments for each 16S rRNA gene 
sequence were determined using the RDP Classifier algo-
rithm (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) against the Silva (SSU123) 16S rRNA database using a confidence threshold of 70%. DNA library building and data analysis were performed 
in accordance with the methods described by Zhang et al. 
[13]. The sequence data in this study have been deposited 
in NCBI under the SRA accession number SRP227025.
2.5. Data analysis
Effluent NO
3––N, NO2––N, and NO3––N removal efficien-
cies and the microbial community composition for different 
influent nitrate loading rates were evaluated via one-way ANOVA using SPSS 22.0. P < 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. All significant points were imported into Cytoscape for network analysis. The R-package “pheatmap” 
was used to create heat maps of microbial communities. Other data analyses were performed using ORIGIN 8.0.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Performance characteristics of the denitrification system
The denitrification performance for the influent NO
3––N 
loading rate (NLR) ranged from 0.30 to 1.28 g/(L d) depend-
ing on the influent NO3––N concentrations and HRTs in the 
PHBV-supported system, as shown in Fig. 1a. The initial 
operating conditions for the PHBV reactor were a NO3––N 
concentration of 80 mg/L and an HRT of 6.5 h. With the 
propagation of microorganisms and biofilm formation on the PHBV surface, the NO
3––N concentration decreased 
gradually, and the effluent NO3––N concentration became 
stable. NO3––N was completely removed on day 13. This 
finding indicated that the PHBV had a shorter domestica-tion time than that of the biopolymer PCL [5] and a lon-ger time than that of blended materials for biodegradable production, such as starch/polycaprolactone [14]. NO
2––N 
is the primary intermediate in the denitrification process. NO
2––N showed substantial accumulation (1.43 mg/L) during the lag period (Fig. 1b). During the stable opera-tion stage (phase 1), the NO
3––N concentration decreased to 
0.87 mg/L on days 14–47. Furthermore, the NO2––N concen-
tration was negligible. During phase 2, the HRT decreased to 2.5 h, and the NLR increased to 0.77 g/(L d). The effluent 
NO
3––N concentration did not fluctuate significantly. The 
average NO3––N concentrations did not exceed 1.20 mg/L, 
and the NO3––N removal efficiency was 98.63%. In addi-
tion, the effluent NO2––N remained lower than 0.10 mg/L. 
During phases 1 and 2, the denitrification rate was equal to the NLR. During phase 3, the HRT was further shortened to 1.5 h, and the NO
3––N concentration increased within a nar -
row range. The average effluent NO3––N concentration was 
11.42 mg/L, and the NO3––N removal efficiency decreased to 
85.86%. Although the NO3––N removal efficiency decreased, 
the denitrification rate increased to 1.11 g/(L d). This find-
ing implies that the PHBV-supported denitrification sys-tem could exhibit excellent performance with a low HRT. However, during phase 4, the HRT was lengthened to 1.9 h, and the influent NO
3––N concentration increased to 
100.0 mg/L; thus, the NLR remained the same as that in 
phase 3. The NO3––N concentration increased substantially 
to 24.47 mg/L. The NO3––N removal efficiency was 75.39%. 
In addition, the denitrification rate decreased to 0.95 g/(L d).

efficiency (a) and NH4+–N and DOC (b) in the PHBV reactor 
during different phases.S. Zhang et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 215 (2021) 23–30 26
Clearly, the increased influent NO3––N concentration led to 
an increasing effluent NO3––N concentration and a decreas-
ing nitrate removal efficiency. With the decreasing NO3––N 
removal efficiency, the effluent NO2––N clearly increased 
(phases 3 and 4). In comparison with the HRT, a high influ-
ent NO3––N concentration negatively affected the nitrate 
removal performance when using PHBV-supported denitri-fication systems, exceeding the denitrification capability of the system. Microorganisms have a certain carrying capacity for environmental pollution. Once the threshold is exceeded, the processing capacity of microorganisms would be reduced, as described by Xu et al. [15].
The effluent ammonia concentrations in different phases 
are shown in Fig. 1b. Ammonia was not detected during the lag period. The ammonia concentration then increased slightly during the stable stage of phase 1. The average ammonia concentration was 0.21 mg/L. From phase 2 to 
phase 4, the ammonia concentration did not change substan-tially, with averages of 0.18, 0.28, and 0.14 mg/L for phases 
2, 3, and 4, respectively. In general, in the heterotrophic denitrification system, ammonia is generated by the follow-ing mechanisms: dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammo-nium [16]; an increased biofilm thickness creating a suitable environment for the bacteria with fermentative abilities, thereby reducing nitrate to ammonium [17]; and cell lysis into the effluent [18]. Therefore, backwashing at a certain time is an effective way to avoid ammonium accumulation.
The effluent DOC concentrations over the entire opera-
tion period are shown in Fig. 1b. During the start-up stage, the DOC concentrations ranged from 3.41 to 11.19 mg/L. 
The production of organic matter is primarily derived from the degradation of solid carbon sources, and its consump-tion is primarily used for the growth and denitrification of microorganisms. During this phase, microorganisms did not colonize the system. Therefore, the DOC concentration remained at a low level, which was not conducive to denitri-fication. The effluent DOC increased to 26.84 mg/L on day 
13, indicating that the microbes began to degrade the PHBV rapidly. The high level of DOC lasted for several days and then decreased gradually. During phases 2 to 4, the effluent DOC concentrations averaged 8.68, 7.75, and 9.05 mg/L for 
each phase. These results indicated that organic carbon from PHBV degradation exceeds the amount of carbon required for microbial growth and denitrification. In a steady-state corncob and PHBV/PLA-supported denitrification system, the effluent DOC concentration is much higher than that in this study [19,20]. Some studies have shown that decreas-ing the HRT would decrease the production of soluble organic substances [9]. However, this was not observed in our study. It is possible that the decreased HRT did not lead to a decrease in the denitrification efficiency, and organic carbon was utilized efficiently by the microbes.
3.2. Microbial community analysis
Biofilm samples A, B, C, and D were collected from the 
PHBV SPD reactor on days 30, 61, 81, and 105, respectively. 
Low-quality reads were eliminated, and 53,151 ± 3,019 
to 57,556 ± 4,055 effective reads were collected from four 
stages of biofilm samples. Based on the mothur algorithm, OTUs with a 97% shared similarity threshold were obtained. The alpha diversity indexes Chao1 and ACE were used to evaluate the richness of the microbial community. As shown in Table 2, as the influent nitrate loading increased, microbial richness increased. This relationship was also supported by the rarefaction curve (Fig. S2). In addition, the sparse curve showed that the sequencing depth was sufficient to describe the characteristics of the microbial community. Based on the Shannon index, microbial diver -
sity increased as the NLR increased (Table S3). Therefore, the NLR might affect the community structure and composition.
The microbial communities of biofilms on the surface 
of the PHBV were analyzed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum 
during the entire phase, as shown in Fig. 2a. Proteobacteria  
accounted for more than 80% of the total sequence reads for each sample. The dominance of Proteobacteria in the 
PHBV denitrification system was consistent with previ-ous results obtained by Zhang et al. [13] and Xu et al. [19]. Furthermore, Proteobacteria is the dominant phylum in PBS, 
PCL, SPCL-supported SPD systems [21–23]. Proteobacteria  
has been identified as the dominant phylum contribut-ing to denitrification under various water conditions [24]. Microbial succession analyses showed that the HRTs had no significant effect on the relative abundance of the dom-inant phylum. As shown in Fig. 2b, with respect to bacte-rial classes, Betaproteobacteria (73.12%, 79.84%, 63.06%, and 
62.71%) was predominant, followed by Gammaproteobacteria  
(5.91%, 8.18%, 23.23%, and 8.05%) and Alphaproteobacteria  
(9.09%, 2.79%, 4.54% and 1.76%) in samples obtained at dif-ferent phases of denitrification. These dominant bacteria belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria. Previous studies have 
reported that Betaproteobacteria, a subclass of Proteobacteria, 
is advantageous in denitrification systems employing polymers as the carbon source [23,25]. In addition, the abundances of Clostridia (9.06%) and Epsilonproteobacteria  
(10.39%) increased during phase 4, suggesting that these classes contribute under high influent nitrate loading in the denitrification system. This conclusion is supported by that of Chen et al. [26].
Fig. 2c shows the relative abundances in the PHBV 
reactor at the genus level. At this level, Diaphorobacter  
and Dechloromonas were predominant during all phases, 
accounting for 51.76%, 46.20%, 21.58%, and 16.20% and 4.38%, 13.51%, 20.59%, and 21.66% of the genera, respec-tively. Stenotrophomonas, Sulfurospirillum, Thauera, and 
Zoogloea improved to various extents during phases 3 and 4. Diaphorobacter and Dechloromonas have been com-
monly identified as the dominant genera in SPD sys-tems [23,25,27–31]. However, abundances differ among different SPD systems. In general, the abundance of Dechloromonas is highest [12]. Dechloromonas belongs to the 
class Betaproteobacteria and can oxidize benzene, ibuprofen, 
and other mono-aromatic compounds into CO
2 in an anoxic 
environment with nitrate as the electron acceptor [11,12,32]. 
Diaphorobacter is a denitrifying bacterium. Both nitrate and 
nitrite reductase activities were detected for eight isolated strains of Diaphorobacter. However, the nitrate reduction 
rate is 1.5 times greater than the nitrite reduction rate in 
Diaphorobacter sp. [33]. In this study, the relative abundance 
of Diaphorobacter decreased significantly from 51.76% to 
16.20%, and the Dechloromonas abundance increased from 27 S. Zhang et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 215 (2021) 23–30
4.38% to 21.66% owing to the increased influent nitrate 
loading (P  < 0.05). These results indicated that the oper -
ational state of the reactor affected the species diversity. Dechloromonas accumulated under high influent nitrate 
loading, whereas Diaphorobacter was largely noted under 
low influent nitrate loading.
3.3. Network analysis of microbial communities and 
denitrification performance
To identify the effect of microbial interactions on 
effluent quality, a network diagram was generated to eval-
uate relationships among bacterial taxa. A bacterial relative abundance of greater than 0.5% was applied. Pearson cor -
relation coefficients between the dominant bacterial genes and the effluent composition and NO
3––N removal efficiency 
were calculated using a one-tailed test. Correlations with P-values of less than 0.05 were included in the network 
shown in Fig. 3.
The nitrate removal efficiency exhibited a positive 
correlation with the abundances of Dechloromonas and 
Sulfurospirillum. Interestingly, these genera displayed negative correlations with the accumulated NO
2––N con-
centration, suggesting that increasing the abundance of Dechloromonas and Sulfurospirillum 
in the PHBV system 
could increase the denitrification efficiency. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between NLR and Diaphorobacter. This may explain why the NO
3––N removal 
rate and denitrification efficiency decreased during phases 3 and 4. Based on the network diagram and the denitrifi-cation results summarized in Fig. 1, we found that there was a negative correlation between the NLR and the nitrate 
removal rate. Some microorganisms do not show a direct 
link to nitrate removal but may still play an important 
role in the solid-phase nitrification process.
3.4. Analysis of microbial functions
To analyze the functions of the primary microorgan-
isms in the system, 25 horizontal genus functions with the 
highest contents were selected. A heat map analysis of the 25 genus functions was performed using the “pheatmap” package in R, and the functional differences among sam-ples were compared (Fig. 4). It is apparent that the denitri-fication function dominated over all stages, especially in phases 1 and 2. The results for the denitrification rate shown in Fig. 1 support this conclusion. At the genus level

The data are shown as the means ± SD of 3 replicates.
Fig. 3. Network correlations between the microbial community structure at the genus level and the denitrification performance.S. Zhang et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 215 (2021) 23–30 28
(Fig. 2c), Diaphorobacter and Dechloromonas were the dom-
inant bacteria involved in denitrification. During phases 
3 and 4, the abundances of these genera decreased, which may account for the decrease in the denitrification rate and the high nitrate concentration in the effluent during these two periods. Previous studies have reported that PHBV is not directly utilized by microorganisms and must be hydrolyzed into soluble monomers, dimers, or trimers, which could act as carbon sources for bacterial growth and denitrification [8]. Therefore, chemoheterotrophy dominated each sample. It is worth noting that there were no harmful microorganisms over all phases of operation.
4. Conclusions
High denitrification rates in a PHBV-supported sol-
id-phase denitrification reactor were achieved for high 
nitrate-concentration wastewater treatment. Moreover, com-pared to the HRT, the influent NO
3––N concentration has a 
greater effect on the denitrification efficiency at the same NLR. In an analysis of the microbial community structure of the biofilm, Diaphorobacter and Dechloromonas were pre-
dominant during all stages. Additionally, the nitrate removal efficiency exhibited a positive correlation with the abun-dance of Dechloromonas, and there was a negative correlation 
between the NLR and the Diaphorobacter. Comprehensive 
evaluations of relationships between the dominant genera and nitrate removal capacity will help reveal the mecha-nism underlying the efficient operation of PHBV-supported denitrification systems.Acknowledgment
