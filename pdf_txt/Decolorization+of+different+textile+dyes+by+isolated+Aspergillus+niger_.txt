©2019 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC)IN this study, fungal isolate D2-1 was isolated from contaminated soil collected from textile 
industry companies and showed high potentiality for decolorization of two different azo 
dyes. This isolate was identified as Aspergillus niger  D2-1 using morphological and cultural 
characteristic as well ITS gene sequencing. Decolorization process under different optimized 
condition of azo dye concentration, pH, incubation periods, inoculum size and different carbon 
and nitrogen sources were investigated. The maximum decolorization efficiency against 
100 ppm dye concentration of reactive yellow (4GL) and reactive red (4BL) dyes of 98.62 
%and 92.42 %, respectively, were recorded for Aspergillus niger  D2-1 at pH 9.0, in presence 
of 2 % glucose and 0.5% yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen sources respectively at room 
temperature after 7 days on shaking conditions. The decolorization percentage was confirmed 
by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum analysis of untreated/treated reactive yellow (4GL) 
and reactive red (4BL) dyes, which showed complete disappearance of peaks at ~ 425 nm and at 
~ 520 nm, indicates the degradation of dyes due to fungal activity. Treatment of textile wastewater 
effluent by Aspergillus niger  D2-1showed high decolorization percentage (59%) for effluent, also 
physico-chemical characteristics of textile effluent such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), 
total dissolved solids(TDS) and total suspended solids (TSS) were decreased from 756 mg/L, 
1597 mg/Land 821 mg/L to 391 mg/L, 845 mg/L and 362 mg/L respectively. Moreover, Gas 
chromatography - mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) of textile effluent before and after treatment were 
recorded and confirmed the potentiality of Aspergillus niger  D2-1 in dyes wastewater treatment.

Introduction                                                                     
Industrial wastewaters are the significant 
contributor to water pollution by polluting 
rivers, lakes and oceans. These wastewaters are 
released by different industries such as textile, 
paper, dyestuffs and pulp, distillery, tannery, 
oil mill and metal industries [ 1, 2]. Textile 
wastewater frequently contains a large variety 
of chemicals additives and dyes expended in 
the dyeing procedure as soda ash, heavy metals, 
acetic acid and caustic soda. Effluence with 
these dyes signifies an important environmental confront to the industry of textile[ 3]. The wastes 
released from textile dyeing industry contains 
different hazard compounds difficult to degrade 
such as azo days, which are the main source 
for environmental pollutions [ 4, 5]. Textile 
industries are one of the largest generators of 
wastewater due to extensive volume of water is 
utilized in finishing and dyeing processes [ 6]. 
Other reports use technology to improve textile 
processes and reduce environmental pollutants 
[7, 8]. It is predictable that, the liberalization of 
10 -15% of dyes in the treated water [ 9], which 1800

affect the photosynthetic activities in aquatic life 
by reducing the intensity of light propagation 
that may also be lethal to some aquatic animals 
and plants due to the attendance of aromatic 
materials, metals, chlorides and because of high 
biochemical oxygen demand  (BOD), COD and 
low biodegradability[ 10, 11]. Inspite of the dyes, 
textile effluent additionally contains variable pH 
and ionic strength, and high concentration of 
salts. Synthetic dyes, which are widely used in 
the industry of textile, act for a main problem in 
environment. It is predictable that 280, 000 tons of 
dyes used in textile are released in such industrial 
wastes every year universal[ 12]. Treatment of 
dyeing wastewater was very valuable before its 
safe clearing into environment[ 13]. The spectrum 
of methods for treatment of textile wastewaters 
is extremely broad[ 11]. Presently, numerous 
physicals, chemicals and biological streatment 
approaches are used.  Numerous types of physico-
chemical treatments like chemical and absorption 
treatments, such as chemical degradation, 
absorption and precipitation, are high costly and 
less efficiency because they involve a long process 
with a huge amount of chemicals and energy and 
some problems in methodological processes [ 13, 
14]. Nowadays, effective biological processes 
would be of great value due to their low cost, 
eco-friendly character and minor sludge giving 
properties[ 13, 15]. The adaptability of microbial 
systems makes them able to degrade wide variety 
of dyes. These methods are normally based on 
the microbial biotransformation of dyes[ 16]. In 
a bioremediation method, utilization of microbial 
consortiums produces a powerful biodegradation 
due to concentrated catabolic actions of 
combination of microbial population[ 17]. The 
textile wastewater can change the chemicals, 
physicals and biologicals character of the getting 
water bodies by increasing the BOD, COD, 
TDS, TSS as well as alters the pH and gives 
the intense colorations to water bodies [ 18].
Different metabolites produced by microbes 
have high potentiality in various biological 
activities[ 19-23 ]. Degradation by fungi is known 
as myco-remediation. Fungi are established for 
their superior talents to produce a well-built 
variety of extracellular proteins and other organic 
compounds, their capacities to adapt to severe 
environmental constraints, and they were easy to 
manipulate with different problems[ 24]. Dyes are 
eliminated by fungi and other microbes through 
biosorption, detoxification, bio-degradation, bio-
accumulation and enzymatic mineralization such as Manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, 
laccase and Manganese independent [ 25][15].
The current study aims to explore and compare 
the decolorization efficiency of two different 
textile azo dyes by Aspergillus  spp. isolated from 
the effluent of textile wastes dyeing industry. In 
supplement, the effect of many parameters such 
as pH, dye concentration, inoculum sizes and 
different nitrogen and carbon sources on dyes 
decolorization was assessed. The augmentation 
of dyes decolorization was estimated by the 
optimization of these microbial and chemical 
parameters (one parameter at a time course).
Materials and Methods                                                                                                                   
Azo dyes and samples collection
Wastewater and soil samples ( 30° 58’ 46.8876” 
N, 31° 10’ 59.5488” E and 30° 58’ 10.8156» N, 
31° 10› 5. 0988» E respectively) used for fungal 
isolations were collected from Ghannam for 
textile Industry Company, El Mahala El Kubra, 
Gharbia Governorate, Egypt.  Two different azo 
dye, Reactive yellow 4GL (150%) and Reactive 
red 4BL (100%) were obtained as a gift from the 
same textile industry.
Fungal isolations
The collected samples were screened for 
isolation of the most potent dye-decolorizing 
fungi. One ml or one gram of either wastewater or 
soil respectively were transferred to 9 ml distilled 
water and serially diluted up to 10-7. About 0.1 ml 
of dilution was inoculated ontoSabourauddextrose 
agar (SDA) plates supplemented with 100 mg/L 
chloramphenicol to suppress the bacterial growth. 
The plates were incubated at 28°Cfor 5-7 days. 
The fungal growth was checked for purity and 
inoculated in culture slant for preservation at 
4oC further study. Twenty-one purified fungal 
isolates were growing on mineral salt media[ 26]
supplemented with different concentrations of azo 
dye Reactive yellow 4GL (150%) and Reactive 
red 4BL (100%)as a sole carbon source to select 
most potent fungal isolates on the basis of their 
ability to tolerate high dyes concentration. 
Molecular identification of azo dye-degrading 
fungi
Molecular identification was conducted based 
on amplification and sequencing of internal 
transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Genomic DNA 
was extracted using the protocol of Gene Jet 
Plant genomic DNA purification Kit (Thermo). 
The ITS region was amplified in polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) using the genomic DNA 1801

as template and ITS primers of ITS1 (5 ̀ - 
TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG -3 ̀) and ITS4 (5 
̀- TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3 ̀). The PCR 
mixture (50μL) contained Maxima Hot Start PCR 
Master Mix (Thermo), 0.5μM of each primer, and 
1μL of extracted fungal genomic DNA. The PCR 
was performed in a DNA Engine Thermal Cycler 
by Sigma Scientific Services Company (Cairo, 
Egypt) with a hot starting performed at 94ºC for 
3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94ºC for 0.5 min, 
55ºC for 0.5 min, and 72ºC for 1 min, followed by 
a final extension performed at 72ºC for 10 min. 
The commercial sequencing was conducted using 
ABI 3730x1 DNA sequencer at GATC Company 
(Germany). The ITS sequence was compared 
against the GenBank database using the NCBI 
BLAST program. Sequences were then compared 
with ITS sequences in the GenBank database 
using BLASTN.
Detection λ max for each dye 
The absorption maxima (λ max) of Reactive 
yellow 4GL and Reactive red 4BL dyes were 
determined by using a Spectrophotometer UV 
(Shimadzu 1800). Optical density of each dye 
solution in water was observed at different 
wavelength between visible regions (300-800 
nm). 
Measurement of azo dye decolorization % 
using most potent fungal isolate
About 2ml of growing mineral salt media 
(supplemented with 100 ppm of separately 
each dye and inoculated with fungal isolate) 
were withdrawn aseptically and centrifuged at 
10,000rpm for 10 minutes. The clear supernatant 
was used for measuring the absorbance by UV-
Visspectrophotometer (Shimadzu 1800) at λmax 
for two dyes individually. The uninoculated 
mineral salt media supplemented with the same 
dye concentration was used as control. Distilled 
water was used as blank. All dyes were prepared 
in triplicate and compared with control. The 
percent decolorization was determined using the 
following formula according to[ 27].
D = [Dye (i) – dye (1) / dye (i)] X 100
where, D, decolorization percentage %; dye (i), 
initial absorbance; dye (1), final absorbance.
Optimization the decolorizing ability of the most 
potent fungal isolate
The effects of different culture conditions 
such as incubation periods, dye concentrations, 
pH, inoculum size and different carbon and nitrogen sources on shaking conditions (150 rpm) 
of decolorization of Reactive yellow (4GL) and 
Reactive red (4BL) by most potent fungal isolate 
was investigated.
Effect of different dye concentrations on 
decolorization percent (%)
This experiment was carried out to investigate 
the effect of different dyes concentrations on dye 
decolorization process. The fungal isolate D2-1 
was growing on mineral salt media supplemented 
with different concentrations of dye Reactive 
yellow (4GL), Reactive red (4BL)( viz.50, 100, 
150, 200, 250, 350, 500, and 650 ppm) as a sole 
carbon source. The decolorization percent (%) 
was recorded at maximum λ max for each dye 
after 6 days of incubation. 
Effect of different incubation periods, 
incubation pH values and inoculum size on the 
decolorization percent (%)
In order to investigate the effect of different 
pH values on the decolorization process, fungal 
isolate D2-1 was inoculated in mineral salt media 
adjusted at different pH values ( viz. 6, 7, 8, 9, 
10 and 11) and supplemented with optimum dye 
concentration. The decolorization percent was 
detected at different incubation times (3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8 and 9 days). Similarly, the decolorization 
percent for each azo dye were estimated under 
different inocula size. Different inocula size ( viz. 
1, 2, 3 and 4 discs, each disc has a diameter 0.7 
mm) of heavy spore fungal growth was inoculated 
in 100 ml mineral salt media supplemented with 
100 ppm for each individual dye. At the end of 
each incubation period, dye decolorizations (%) 
were assayed after 7 days for Reactive yellow 
(4GL) and Reactive red (4BL).
Effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources 
on the dye decolorization by fungal isolate D2-1
In order to evaluate the effect of different carbon 
and nitrogen sources on dye decolorization, 
different carbon sources were added to mineral 
salt broth media containing 100 ppm of each 
dye at 2% concentration with equimolecular 
level for each sugar. The media without carbon 
source was used as a control (containing only 
dye concentration of 100 ppm as carbon source). 
The carbon sources were represented by glucose, 
sucrose, starch, bagasse and cellulose. Similarly, 
with the equivalent amount of nitrogen level 
located at 0.5 %, the effect of different organic 
and inorganic nitrogen source such as sodium 
nitrate, sodium nitrite, ammonium sulphate, urea, 
peptone and yeast extract on dye decolorization 1802
Egypt. J. Chem. 62, No. 10 (2019) SALEM S. SALEM  et al.
were evaluated in media supplemented with 100 
ppm. In each case, all previously mentioned 
optimal conditions of pH, temperature and 
inoculation size were taken into the consideration.
UV- Visiblestudy (λ max) of each dye before 
and after all optimized condition
Untreated stock solution of each dye (control) 
and treated (with fungal isolate D2-1 after all 
previously mentioned optimal conditions) were 
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. UV- Visible 
absorption spectra of the supernatants of untreated 
and treated dye effluents were recorded using a 
UV- Visible is spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 
1800) at room temperature.
Textile wastewater treatment by azo dye-
degrading fungi D2-1
Textile wastewater sample was collected 
from Ghannam for textile Industry Company, El 
Mahala El Kubra, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt.
Plastic bottles were used for water samples 
collection [ 28]. The plastic bottles were sterilized 
by ethylene oxide at low temperature for 
microbiological analysis.
Analysis of textile wastewater
Optical density of the effluent was observed 
at different wavelength between visible regions 
(300800-nm) to determine λ max for textile 
wastewater. Physicochemical characteristics 
of textile wastewater analysis before and after 
the treatment processes were estimated for: pH, 
conductivity, color, TDS, TSS, COD and BOD.
These were carried out according to the standard 
methods recommended by American public health 
association, [ 29]which are recommended by 
Egyptian Law 93/1962 Dec. 44/2000 to measure 
reduction in these parameters.
GC –MS Spectroscopy for untreated/treated 
wastewater
The samples were analyzed at Chemical 
War Department, Ministry of Defense, Cairo, 
Egypt. These tests were evaluated by using The 
Agilent 5975C Series GC/MSD and The Agilent 
7890A Gas Chromatograph. Gas chromatography 
(GC) and mass spectroscopy (MS) are an 
effective combination for chemical analysis. Gas 
chromatography analysis separates compounds 
in complex mixtures, and mass spectroscopy 
analysis determines the molecular weight and 
ionic fragments of individual components, aiding 
in the identification of those compounds. Helium 
was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/
min. The injector temperature was maintained at 280°C, while the oven conditions were 80°C for 
2 min, followed by an increase to 200°C based 
on a rate of 10°C7min, followed by a further 
increase to 280°C based on a rate of 20°C/min. 
The compounds were identified on the basis of 
their mass spectra and using the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) library[ 30, 
31]. Numerous American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) standards that cover GC/MS 
are also utilized for routine determinations.
Statistical analysis
Data were statistically analyzed by Sigma 
plot v, was used for multiple sample comparison, 
when normality and homogeneity of variance 
were satisfied.
Results and Discussion                                                       
Fungal isolation and identification
At the current study, twenty-one fungal 
isolates were isolated from soil and water samples 
of the textile industry. Amongst, twenty-one 
purified fungal isolates, isolate coded D2-1 
showed highest decolorization percentage for 
two different azo dyes. The taxonomic status of 
fungal isolate was defined by sequencing of ITS 
genes. The morphological, culture characteristic 
as well molecular identification based on ITS 
sequencing analysis for isolate D2-1 was similar 
to Aspergillus niger  as showed in Fig 1. 
Determination of absorption maxima (λmax) of 
Reactive yellow (4GL) and Reactive red (4BL) 
dyes
The absorption maximum for used azo dyes 
were determined using spectrophotometer UV 
(Shimadzu 1800). Optical density of each dye 
dissolved separately in water was observed at 
different wavelength between visible regions ( 300--
800nm). Reactive yellow (4GL) and Reactive 
red (4BL) dyes showed maximum absorbance at 
425.0 nm and 520.0 nm respectively. Therefore, 
the detected λ max was used in the following 
optimization process to detect decolorization 
percent.
Effect of dye concentrations on fungal 
decolorization
In this study, it was noted that, when dye 
concentration increased from 50 ppm to 650 ppm, 
the capacity of Aspergillus niger  D2-1 for dyes 
removal was decreased. The dye concentrations 
between 150 ppm to 650 ppm were more 
incomprehensible to be decolorized than the 
low dye concentrations. Data reported in Table 1 
showed that, dye concentration of 100 ppm was 1803

sub-lethal dose which hinders the dye removal 
capacity of the two azo dyes. In addition to the 
toxicity of high dye concentration on fungal 
growth, also, dye decolorization was hardly to be 
achieved and insufficiently data is known about 
the fungal dye decolorization at that concentration. 
Therefore, dyes concentration of 100 ppm was 
chosen for further examination in this study (Table 
1). There is a report in which decolorization 
was reduced due to intensify in initial dye 
concentration [ 32]. Certain reports proved the 
high toxicity of azo dyes to microbes involved 
in bio-degradation. Toxicity is interacted to dye type, dye concentration and the active sites of azo 
reductase enzymes blockage by dye particle[ 16, 
33]. The toxicity of the dyes to fungal cells, 
especially at higher concentrations may be 
attributed to high molecular quantity, structural 
complication and the presence of inhibitory 
groups in the dye such as sulfonic acid[ 34].
Fetyan et al ., [35]reported that, Saccharomyces 
cervevisiae  showed high efficiency to decolorize 
direct blue 71 to maximum activity (100%) 
and this decolorization percentage decreased at 
higher concentration above 200 ppm which may 
be appropriate to the toxic effect of these higher

concentrations for microbial cell.also, Congo red 
and Bromophenol blue added to culture media 
(PDA) separately were inhibited the growth 
of Aspergillus sp. , at high concentration when 
contrasted to their respective controls[ 36].
Effect of different incubation periods and pH 
values on dye decolorization percentages
The maximum decolorization of two azo dyes 
by Aspergillus niger  D2-1 was recorded at pH 9, 
and any increase or decrease in pH value from 
the optimal pH are reduced the decolorization 
efficiency (Fig. 2 A and B). Our finding supports 
that, the decolorization of azo dyes reaches the 
greatest value at alkaline pH range, but acidic or 
highly alkalinity was inhibit dye decolorization by 
fungal strain. Our results showed that, maximum 
decolorization percentage of Reactive yellow 
(4GL) and Reactive red (4BL) by Aspergillus 
niger  D2-1 was reached to 48.01% and 32.40% 
respectively at pH 9.0. It is achievable that pH 
change affects the transport of dye particles 
crossway the cell membrane of microbes, which 
is reflected as the rate-limiting stage for the 
decolorization[ 6]. The results in present study 
was slightly similar with the results obtained by 
[33], reported that, the maximum decolorization 
of Remazol black was attained at pH 9. Although 
greatest azo-reductase enzyme optimum pH is 7, 
some alkali-thermostable azo-reductase showed 
maximum decolorization and best pH within 
variety from pH 8 to 9 [ 33, 37]. Reactive azo 
dyes under alkaline condition lose hydrogen ions, 
which leads to the ionization of the dye, affecting 
Fig. 2. Effect of different incubation periods and pH values on the decolorization percentages treated

as mean values of three replicates ± S.E.its constancy and facilitating its elimination 
from solutions[ 33]. In contrast, [ 34]reported that 
decolorization of dyes at higher concentration 
was carried out an acidic condition, which further 
facilitates their better removal enzymatic or by cell 
wall adsorption by the fungi. Finally, our results 
are more applicable in decolorization process 
at large scale because most textile wastewater 
were alkaline pH valuesand decolorization under 
alkaline states has been usually preferred in 
industrial treatments, as procedures using reactive 
azo dyes are functioned under alkaline conditions.
Data represented in Fig. 2 A and B revealed 
that, the maximum decolorization of Reactive 
yellow (4GL) and Reactive red (4BL) dyes 
were48.01% and 32.40% respectively at 7 
days of incubation period. After 7 days, the 
decolorization decreased gradually which may 
be attributed to the efflux mechanism of dye 
from the fungal cells to reduce dye toxicity. 
The result in present study was slightly similar 
with the results obtained by [ 36], showed that, 
the maximum decolorization of Direct blue dye 
treated by Aspergillus flavus  was obtained at 7 
days of incubation period and the decolorization 
decreased gradually after 7 days of incubation 
due to enzymatic biodegradation activity along 
with physical binding of dye on fungal biomass 
and accumulation of dyes results that might have 
hindered growth and metabolizing latent of fungi. 
Ali et al., [ 38]reported that, decolorization rate 
by brown-rot fungi for azo dyes was generally 
high at 96 h. Besides, it maintained on declining

with   transitory time in stirred fungal cultures. 
El-Sayeh, [ 39]also found that, the maximum 
decolorization of Direct Violet dye treated by 
Aspergillus fumagatus found at the 4th day of 
incubation but decreased after that as well as the 
level of enzymes production. 
Effect of different inocula size (disc) on the 
decolorization rate
The data presented graphically in Fig. 3 A and 
B showed the relation between inocula sizes and 
decolorization percentages. The optimal inoculum 
size needed for the maximum decolorization 
were three heavy growth discs of Aspergillus 
niger  D2-1 inoculated in 100 ml of broth media. 
The decolorization percentages were reached to 
57.62% and 39.86% for Reactive yellow (4GL) 
and Reactive red (4BL) dyes respectively. 
Effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources on 
the dye decolorization
In this study, it was found that highest 
dye decolorization by Aspergillus niger  D2-1 
was reached 89.5 % and 84.41% for Reactive 
yellow dye (4GL) and Reactive red dye (4BL) 
respectively in glucose supplemented medium 
(Fig. 4 A and B). With regard to the influence 
of different carbon sources on decolorization 
process, it was found that, the tested fungus 
was able to grow well and decolorize dyes with 
all of the tested carbon sources. Importantly, 
Aspergillus niger  not only use glucose and

agro-industrial wastes such as baggas. The results 
in present study was similar with the results 
obtained by Namdhari et al ., [34], showed that 
the highest decolorization of Reactive Blue MR 
by Aspergillus niger was achieved with glucose 
supplementation. Addition of second carbon 
source beside dye was enhance fungal growth 
and hence increase adsorption/degradation rate 
[40]. Besides, the dyes removal rate can be 
linked with the accessible co-substrates[ 41], and 
with the exponential growth phase[ 42]. Glucose 
were used to investigate their influence on the 
decolorization efficacy of the fungal isolates 
because of it is rapid utilization as a simple sugar 
by organisms before act of complex structure 
like dye [ 43, 44].
Data analysis showed that, the best nitrogen 
sources utilized by Aspergillus niger  D2-1 to 
maximum decolorization of reactive yellow dye 
(4GL) and reactive red dye (4BL) was yeast extract. 
After adding yeast extract as nitrogen source, the 
decolorization percentages were reached to 98 and 
92 for reactive yellow dye (4GL) and reactive red 
dye (4BL). The results in the present study was

that, Synthetic and real effluents lost 60% of the

that, five different organic and inorganic nitrogen 
sources approximating peptone, yeast extract, 
beef extract, sodium nitrate and ammonium 
chloride were tested for extracellular laccase and 
other protein production in Ganoderma  sp. Yeast 
extract supported the maximum decolorization 
activity and maximum extracellular protein 
content of 140 μg/mL.
UV-Visible spectrum for two azo dye before and 
after optimization
The full UV-Visible spectrum of the 
decolorized samples could reveal the mode of 
decolorization. A decrease in the visible region 
(200-800 nm) indicates a decrease in dye color, 
while complete disappearance of the peaks 
indicated that, color removal occurs through 
breakdown of azo bond which is responsible for 
dye color. The absence of the peak at visible region 
are probably due to color removal and aromatic 
amines formation from cleavage of azo bond[ 47]. 
In the present study, complete disappearance of    
the peaks at ~ 425 nm and at ~ 520 nm in the 
corresponding UV- Visible spectrum (Fig. 8) 
of the treated yellow and red dyes respectively, 
strongly indicates the degradation of dye effluent 
Fig. 6. UV-Visible spectrum for azo dye before and after optimization using a Spectrophotometer UV (Shimadzu 
1800).  A) Reactive yellow dye (4GL). B) Reactive red dye (4BL).due to fungal action. Decolorization of dyes may 
occur by adsorption[ 48] or degradation[ 49]. The 
adsorption of dyes receipts location only on the 
surface of living cells, while creation of new 
compounds is the result of dye degradation by 
fungal enzymes. In case of dye removal through 
biodegradation, the chief visible light absorption 
peak completely disappears, or a new peak 
performs [ 50]. Dye adsorption can also be easily 
observed by the presence of clearly colored cell 
pellets, whereas those retaining their prototype 
colors are accompanied by the occurrence of 
biodegradation[ 51]. In the present investigation, 
98% decolorization was achieved in 60 h and the 
cell pellets were not pigmented. These results 
brightly support the evidence of biodegradation 
of textile effluent by Aspergillus niger  D2-1 in 
the decolorization process.
Textile wastewater treatment
The effluent released by industries of textile 
has leads to hazardous problem of soils and 
groundwater pollution. The physio-chemical 
analysis of tested textile effluent helped us to 
estimate the pollution level. Thus, the physio-

chemical parameters test for effluents were 
examined and conducted. The absorption 
maximum (λ max) of textile wastewater was 
determined, and the effluent showed maximum 
absorbance at 427.0 nm.
Physico-chemical characterization of textile 
effluent
The physicochemical parameters of the 
raw textile wastewater (effluent) before and 
after treatment by Aspergillus niger  D2-1 was 
conducted. The results showed that effluents 
have dark yellowish color with a conductivity 
of 1340 -s/cm, temperature 29°C (measured by 
a laboratory thermometer), pH 9. 6, BOD, COD, 
TDS and TSS were 4 51,756,1597 and 821 mg/l 
respectively, which indicates a broad range of 
chemical contaminants (Table 2). Effluents color 
is dark due to the mixture of chemicals and various 
dyes used in the dyeing procedure[ 52]. The pH 
of the effluent modifies the physio-chemical 
properties of water which in turn badly affects the 
biodiversity. High pH is mainly due to the use of 
bicarbonate, carbonate, NaOH and H2O2 during 
bleaching process in the textile industry[ 53]. 
Soil permeability gets affected, which results in 
polluting the underground resources of water [ 54]. 
Elevated temperature leans to decrease the gases solubility in water, which is eventually expressed 
as high BOD/COD. The high COD (756 mg/L) 
and BOD (451 mg/L) level in the textile effluent, 
indicates the high toxicity of the effluent and this 
is very harmful for the whole ecology and aquatic 
system of the obtaining waterbodies. High TDS 
value reduces the sun light diffusion into the water 
and eventually reductions the photosynthesis in 
aquatic flora. This cause reduction in dissolved 
oxygen value of water bodies, which results for 
extremely depleted purification of wastewater by 
microbes[ 34]. Data recorded in Table 2 illustrated 
that, treatment using A.niger was decolorized 59 
% of textile wastewater (effluent) after 7days.
The results in present study was similar with 
the results obtained by Saroj et al., [ 55], who 
showed that, fungal consortium including three 
strains Penicillium oxalicum , Aspergillus niger  
and Aspergillus flavus  has been developed and 
this consortium exhibited remarkably great 
potential to decay azo dyes (Acid Red 183, Direct 
Blue 15 and Direct Red 75) at different initial 
concentrations. The reduction in BOD and COD 
level after treatment with fungal isolate could be 
as a result of removal of organic load from the 
effluent and ultimately the toxicity decreased as 
stated by [ 56]. Reduction in the concentration 
of TDS after treatment may be attributed to the

GC –MS of untreated and treated textile effluent 
by Aspergillus niger D2-1
This analysis was used for confirming the 
biodegradation of textile wastewater effluent 
after treatment by Aspergillus niger  D2-1 as 
compared controls (wastewater effluent without 
any treatments). The intermediates obtained 
during the biodegradation of textile wastewater 
were compared to the NIST library [ 30, 31]. The 
GC-MS spectra revealed four major compounds 
of the wastewater before treatment at retention 
time 12.5 (1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentane) 
with peak area 39.13%, 12.6 (1,2,3,4- 
pentamethylcyclopentene) with peak area 11.97 
%, 14.031 (3,3,4-trimethyldecane) with peak area 
10.75 % and 14.13(1,4-dimethylcyclohexane) 
with peak area 20.10 % as shown in Fig. 8 A.
Our data represented in Fig. 8 B showed 
that, the mass spectra of the treated textile 
effluent by Aspergillus niger  D2-1 . When 
Fig. 8. Mass spectra of wastewater effluent due to Aspergillus niger  D2-1 treatment. A) Untreated textile 
wastewater B) treated textile wastewater.compared to the mass spectra of the untreated 
effluent it is seen that, the values of peaks are 
diminished upon biotreatment and become 
6.37 % (1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentane) 
at retention time 12.5, 1.86% (1,2,3,4- 
pentamethylcyclopentene) at retention time 12.6 
, 1.91 % and 0.71 % (3,3,4-trimethyldecane) 
at retention time 14.02 and 14.3 respectively 
and finally 0.21 %  (1-methyl ,4-methyl,cis, 
cyclohexane) at retention time 12.8. Low peak 
area values in GC-MS analysis indicated cleaving 
of azo dyes and further mineralization of aromatic 
amines into simpler aliphatic compounds due to A. 
niger  treatment as reported previously by [ 58, 59].
The biodegradation pathway of dyes is supported 
by other reports which appeared that the first stage 
of the biodegradation of some dyes was either 
an oxidation reaction or a direct demethylation 
process followed by a stepwise demethylation 
and deamination process [ 31, 60, 61]. Generally, 
the mechanism of fungal dye decolorization 
and degradation is either biodegradation and 
biosorption by living cells or biosorption by 
dead cells which implicates physico-chemical 
interaction such as deposition, adsorption, and 
ion-exchange [ 36].
Conclusions                                                                   
At this study, Aspergillus niger D2-1 isolated 
from the textile effluent contaminated soil has 
high potentiality in azo dye degradation. The optimum conditions for dye decolorization 
efficiency of Aspergillus niger was achieved in 
vitro  with glucose, yeast extract supplementation, 
and 3 discs (7 mm)of fungal inoculum size, 
at pH9and incubation time 7days. Significant 
reduction in BOD, COD, TSS and TDS was 
detected after treatment of textile wastewater 
industry by Aspergillus niger , thus suggesting 
safe for discharge. GC–MS and UV spectroscopy 1810

analysis confirmed biodegradation. Finally, this 
study concluded that, biotreatment of azo dye 
and textile wastewater effluent by fungal cell 
was provided a cost-effective, easily applicable 
and eco-friendly.
