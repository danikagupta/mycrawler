Introduction
Hair dyes contain over 5000 chemical substances, in particular the 
aromatic amines. Hair dyes can be divided into four categories based 
on its chemical composition and mechanism of action; (1) permanent 
(oxidative) dyes, (2) temporary or semi semi-permanent (direct) dyes, 
(3) metal salts and (4) natural dyes. It consists of primary intermediates 
(e.g., para -phenylenediamine, para -toluenediamine, ortho -
aminophenol, and para -aminophenol) that are mixed with couplers 
(e.g., m-aminophenols, m-hydroxyphenols, resorcinol and others) 
and oxidizing agent to generate coloured oxidation product through 
chemical reaction that binds irreversibly within the hair shaft. Hydrogen 
peroxide is commonly used as oxidant in the dyeing process. Hydrogen 
peroxide causes swelling of the hair cuticle which allows the diffusion of 
precursors into hair cortex and catalyzes the oxidation of the precursors 
to large coloured molecules that are infused within the hair shaft. On 
the other hand, temporary hair dyes contain azo, triphenylmethane, 
anthraquinone, or indamines dyes, while semi-permanent dyes contain 
nitro-phenylenediamines, nitro-aminophenols and some azo dyes. 
Temporary and semi-permanent hair dyes coat on the outer cuticle or 
surface of hair and are removed after one to several washings [1-3]. It is 
estimated that in one hair dyeing process with about 4 g of amines, 40 
mg or 1% of hair dye chemicals (precursors, products and side products) 
are absorbed through the scalp [2].
Permanent hair dyes are widely used with over 80% of market share 
in the United States [2,3]. In 1980’s, some hair dye chemicals were 
banned from use due to their mutagenic and carcinogenic effects as 
evidenced by laboratory animal studies. However, hair dye ingredients 
such as para -phenylenediamine (PPD) and para -toluenediamine (PTD) 
are still being used to date [1]. For the past 50 years, PPD has been used 
commonly as a primary intermediate in the formulation of permanent 
hair dyes and still remains unchanged. According to a previous study, 76 
out of 115 commercial oxidative hair dyes showed PPD concentrations 
ranging from 2.2 to 3.4% [4]. Today, the European Union cosmetic directive regulation allows maximum PPD concentration of up to 6% in 
hair dyes [5]. PPD is an aromatic amine with a chemical formula C6H8N2 
(Figure 1). Present in the form of white crystals, PPD oxidizes in the 
air turning from red to brown and finally black. PPD has the ability to 
penetrate hair shaft and follicle and has a strong protein binding capacity 
thereby making it an effective hair dye chemical. Additionally, it is also 
used in fur and textile industries and as vulcanizing agent in the rubber 
industry [2].
Given its widespread use in the United States, Europe, and East 
Asia, safety assessment of hair dye ingredients remains a growing 
concern [2,3]. The possible association between permanent hair dye use 
and cancer risk has been examined in several cohort studies [3,6]. In a 
population based control study in Italy, the use of permanent hair dyes 
was associated with leukemia and follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 
[7]. Additionally, Gago-Dominguez and co-workers reported that the 
risk of bladder cancer among women who used permanent hair dyes 
at least once a month and barbers with more than 10 years of working 
experience increases by 2.1 fold and 5 fold respectively compared to 
the non-users [8]. Furthermore, increased risk in cancers of the lung, 
colorectal, bladder, pancreas, lung, cervix and in situ  cancer of the skin 
were observed among hairdressers in a follow up study from the year 
1960 to 1998 [9]. Besides, bacterial test using Salmonella thyphimurium  
tester strain showed 89% of commercial permanent hair dye ingredients para-Phenylenediamine Containing Hair Dye: An Overview of

Abstract
The great demand for hair dyes can be seen by the proliferation of hair salons. Their ability to impart temporary 
or permanent colour change to the hair satisfies the desire of consumers for beauty, fashion, and a look-younger 
image. para-Phenylenediamine (PPD) is found in more than 1000 hair dye formulations and is the most frequently used 
permanent hair dye component in Europe, North America, and East Asia. In addition, PPD containing permanent hair 
dyes account for three-quarters of global use and more than one-third of women use in Europe, North America, and East 
Asia. However, PPD has been banned in Germany, France and Sweden in the early 1900's as a hair dye component 
and the hazard of PPD on health has been discussed for the past few decades. PPD containing hair dyes have been 
associated with cancer and mutagenicity, with supportive evidences from both clinical and laboratory studies. Apart from 
that, PPD has potential toxicity which includes acute toxicity such as allergic contact dermatitis and subacute toxicity. 
In this article, we provide comprehensive review on the chemical ingredients of hair dyes, roles of PPD in hair dye, 
metabolic mechanisms of PPD through in vivo  and in vitro  studies, and mechanism involvement in the health effect of 
PPD as evidenced from both clinical and laboratory studies.

such as 2,4-diaminoanisole, 4-nitro- o-phenylenediamine, 2-nitro-
p-phenylenediamine, PPD, and others showed various degrees of 
mutagenecity [10]. Although numerous studies have been done, the 
question on whether hair dyes possess significant risk to carcinogenesis 
is still an issue of debate. This is because although the existing 
epidemiologic data indicates the increased risk of cancer is associated 
with the use of hair dye, however the scientific reports that have been 
published are still limited [6,8,11-14].
PPD is known to cause allergic contact dermatitis, so it was banned 
from use in Germany, France and Sweden during the twentieth century. 
According to the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP), 
PPD is a potent contact allergen. Skin contact during hair dyeing 
or tattooing process is the main route of human exposure to PPD. 
Occupational exposure is seen among industrial workers and regular 
hairdressers handling this chemical. [15,16]. Due to the popularity of 
hair dye use and its ability in penetrating human skin, concerns on the 
hair dye toxicity, mutagenicity and/or carcinogenic potential on human 
body need to be adequately considered.
Metabolism of PPD
Metabolism of arylamines, especially those present in the dye 
industry, cigarette smoking and personal care products has been 
extensively studied and reported in various literatures. As such, 
N-acetylation catalyzed by N-acetyltransferases (NATs) is found to be 
the major route of PPD metabolism [17]. The N-acetyltransferase type 
1 (NAT1) found in skin and the N-acetyltransferase type 2 (NAT2) 
found mainly in the liver and guts are two isoforms known in human 
to catalyze the conversion of PPD to its N-mono- (MAPPD) and N,N′-
diacetylated (DAPPD) metabolites [18-20]. Systemic exposure to PPD 
in human body causes production of skin and hepatic metabolites that 
can be detected in the urine. As such, these metabolites and PPD are 
excreted mainly through renal clearance [21-23]. In human study, five 
different metabolites were identified in the urine of subjects after treated 
with dark-shade oxidative hair dye containing (14) C-PPD. Amongst 
the five metabolites, MAPPD and DAPPD are found to be the major 
metabolites made up to around 80-95% of total metabolites found. 
Other metabolites include glucuronic acid conjugates are also reported 
[23]. In other investigations, the DAPPD is the main metabolite detected 
in urine of both male and women volunteers which accounted for 80% 
of total excretion [18,19]. It is worth mentioning that individuals with 
slow NAT2 acetylator phenotype are associated with an increased risk 
for bladder cancer. This was proven in a meta-analysis study which 
demonstrated increased risk for bladder cancer among cigarette smokers 
with slow NAT2 acetylators [24].
Mutagenicity of PPD
In vitro genotoxicity properties of PPD were tested using the Ames 
test, the  micronucleus test in human lymphocytes and mammalian cell mutation assay. Genotoxicity test is a short term screening study done 
to measure carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of various chemicals. The 
Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay is a bacterial reverse 
mutation assay used to detect chemical substances that produce genetic 
damage [25-27]. PPD was shown to be strongly mutagenic to Salmonella 
tester strain TA1538 in the presence of rat liver S-9 preparation and 
weakly mutagenic to TA98 with metabolic activation. PPD when mixed 
with hydrogen peroxide alone gave positive results in the Ames test 
[28,29]. Previous studies demonstrated that the reaction between PPD 
and resorcinol together with an oxidizing agent (hydrogen peroxide) 
yielded an oxidized conjugation product (green chemical) that was 
mutagenic towards Salmonella tester strain TA98. This product when 
topically applied to shaved rats, produced urine that was mutagenic on 
TA98 strain of Salmonella typhimurium [21,28,30,31]. However, a study 
questioned that the activity of PPD in the Ames test might be markedly 
affected by the solvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). It was suggested 
that while freshly prepared solutions in DMSO are non-mutagenic, 
they might become highly mutagenic when allowed standing at room 
temperature for 4 hours [32]. PPD also found to cause chromosomal 
aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells [33].
As an extension to the previous studies, PPD and its metabolites, 
MAPPD and DAPPD were tested for genotoxic properties in another 
study. PPD was found slightly mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium 
strain TA98 in the presence of metabolite activation. However, its  
metabolites MAPPD and DAPPD was non-mutagenic in the Salmonella 
typhimurium  strain TA98. Besides, PPD induced micronuclei in human 
peripheral blood lymphocytes both in the presence or absence of 
metabolite activation. However, MAPPD and DAPPD were negative 
in the micronucleus test. These indicates that the acetylated conversion 
products are the detoxified metabolites [34,35].
Contradicting to the previous results, sister-chromatid exchanges 
(SCE) studies found that single application of hair dye for 6 hours and 
7 days did not consistently increase the SCE levels in the peripheral 
lymphocytes [33]. Similarly, no effect was observed on the frequency 
of SCE levels when the hair dye was applied 13 times at intervals of 3-5 
weeks [36]. Apart from that, 13 commercial hair dye products made 
in China showed negative results in mutagenicity test in Salmonella 
typhimurium  (strains TA98 and TA100) and the micronucleus test in 
mouse bone marrow polychromatic erythrocyte cells [37].
Carcinogenicity of PPD
Hairdressers and barbers were classified under occupational 
exposure group 2A: probably carcinogenic to humans by the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer. In fact, several studies 
have suggested that hairdressers are the high risk group for cancers. 
Takkouche et al. reported that hairdressers in general have increased 
risk of cancer compared to the general population in a meta-analysis 
[6]. It was found that hair dye users have increased risk of bladder 
cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma [38-40]. On 
top of that, an epidemiological study before 1980s found that there was 
a moderate increase risk in lymphoma especially in individuals who use 
personal hair dye [41]. A case control study also showed that hair dye 
users have increased prostate and breast cancer risk [42,43]. In an in vivo  
study by Rojanapo et al. topical application and subcutaneous injection 
of oxidized PPD for 18 months in rats caused a statistically significant 
increase in the incidence of mammary gland, uterine and soft tissue 
tumors of both malignant and benign types [44]. Sontag demonstrated 
that PPD increased the incidence of liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thyroid 
gland, urinary bladder and lung tumors in rats [45].

Nevertheless, there are studies which are unable to show the 
association of carcinogenesis with hair dressers and hair dye users. 
Several meta-analyses have not able to show the association of 
increased risk of cancer among hair dressers and personal hair dye 
users [6,46,47]. Multiple case control studies also found no association 
between breast, lung, stomach, colorectal, bladder and hematopoietic 
cancer with hair dye users [11,12,48-52]. However, it is important to 
note that some of these studies suffer from limiting factors such as small 
population size, non-specific hair dye product, timing and intensity of 
hair dye exposure, thus the conclusion generated by the study should be 
evaluated carefully [53].
Subacute toxicity of PPD - The apoptotic effects
Apoptosis is a gene-regulated programmed cell death crucial to 
maintaining a balance between cell division and cell death. Execution of 
apoptosis ensures that cells with irreparable DNA damage and aberrant 
cell cycle are eliminated from the proliferating population to avoid 
malignant transformation. The extrinsic or death receptor pathway 
and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway are the two main apoptosis 
pathways widely known to date. Defect in any step along the pathway 
and the failure of cells to commit apoptosis is a general hallmark for 
tumor progression [54,55].
As animal studies have demonstrated that increased incidence of 
kidney tumor in PPD-treated rats, two in vitro  studies have investigated 
the apoptosis pathways in different cell lines. The first study has used 
Mardin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to study if PPD would 
induce apoptosis [55]. Research found that PPD decreased cell viability 
in a dose-dependent manner. Presence of apoptosis was made affirmative 
by several observations such as accumulation of sub-G1 peak and G0/
G1-phase arrest in cell cycle, DNA fragmentation in TUNEL assay, 
as well as positive Annexin-V staining. It has been described that the 
apoptotic mechanisms of PPD might involve oxidative stress, reduction 
of membrane potential, p53 as well as intrinsic and extrinsic pathways 
[55,56]. The second study was performed in normal rat kidney proximal 
tubular epithelial (NRK-52E) cells. The study showed that PPD induced 
apoptosis via upregulation of phosphorylated stress-activated protein 
kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein expression 
and downregulation of Ras and Raf protein expression in NRK-52E 
cells. However, Akt, Bcl-2, Bc-XL and Bad protein levels were not 
significantly altered when compared with the controls. In short, PPD 
induced apoptosis via PTK/Ras/Raf/JNK-dependent pathway and was 
independent of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the NRK-52E cells [54]. It 
is interesting to note that the concentrations of PPD used to induce 
apoptosis in the two studies were vastly different. Concentrations used 
in the second study (50, 100, 200, 300 µg/mL) were folds higher than 
the first study (12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 µg/mL) [54-56].
In human urothelial (UROtsa) cells, PPD was shown to induce 
apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of Wnt pathway through 
decreased phosphorylation of LRP6 and the activity of Wnt, Axin, 
Naked and Dvl proteins. Besides, PPD decreased the phosphorylation 
of IKK and IκB which subsequently inhibited the nuclear translocation 
of NF-κB. Moreover, PPD decreased the phosphorylation of mTOR 
and the activity of GbetaL and Raptor dose-dependently, while Rictor 
remained unchanged for all PPD treatments. Activation of Raptor 
protein is known to stimulate cell growth and cell proliferation while 
activation of Rictor contributes to the regulation of cell polarity and 
actin cytoskeleton. The downregulation of Raptor is correlated with the 
inhibition of cell proliferation by PPD. Overall the study demonstrated 
that PPD induced apoptosis in UROtsa cells by inhibiting the activation 
of NF-κB, mTOR, and Wnt signaling [57]. In another study, Huang et al. revealed that PPD induced DNA damage and accumulation of mutant 
p53 and cyclooxygenase-2 proteins in SV-40 immortalized human 
uroepithelial (SV-HUC-1) cells [58]. Their study also found that PPD 
was able to induce autophagy via autophagosomes formation which 
increased the concentration of Beclin-1 and microtubule-associated 
protein light chain 3B (LC3B) via activation of extracellular signal-
regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling pathway and mutant p53 in the 
SV-HUC-1 cells. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor (U0126) was able to 
suppress the autophagy through inhibition of ERK1/2, Beclin-1 and 
LC3B proteins expression in the SV-HUC-1 cells.
In Chang liver cells, PPD induced apoptosis via mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Results revealed that PPD activated 
SAPK/JNK, p38 MAPK and ERK and induced apoptosis [59]. Results 
from another study showed that PPD mediated oxidative stress, loss 
of membrane potential, and caspase 8 activation in both human and 
mouse melanoma cells. Under ultraviolet A exposure, PPD was photo-
degraded and formed a novel photoproduct which induced the reactive 
oxygen species generation, single strand DNA breaks, micronuclei and 
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers formation, lysosomal destabilization 
and cathepsin B releasing. Cathepsin B processed BID to its active form, 
tBID which induced the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria 
and subsequently induced apoptosis [60,61]. Additionally, Chye et 
al. found that PPD was able to induce single DNA breaks in human 
lymphocytes by using alkaline comet assay [62].
In vivo studies demonstrated that sub-chronic topical application 
of different doses (0,  1, 2 and 3 mg/kg/day) of PPD elevated oxidative 
stress, induced germ cell apoptosis, and decreased total sperm count 
causing testicular toxicity in male albino rats [63]. In another study, after 
intraperitoneal administration of PPD, Swiss-Albino mice melanoma 
tumor growth was arrested by the apoptotic activity [60].
Acute toxicity of PPD - Contact allergy and dermatitis
Several cases of mild to severe localized and systemic contact 
allergy and dermatitis due to the usage of PPD products such as 
permanent hair dyes, black henna and permanent eyelashes have 
been reported. Systemic contact allergy and dermatitis syndromes 
include conditions such as blepharoconjunctivitis, acute dermatitis, 
erythematous, hyperpigmentation and lichenification [64-72]. It has 
been demonstrated that PPD in hair dye, albeit much lower than the 
common dosage used under diagnostic patch testing, is sufficient to 
elicit a moderate to strong allergic responses in PPD-allergic human 
subjects [73]. Factors predisposing to individual susceptibility to PPD 
contact dermatitis are not well defined. Supported by animal study, the 
immuno-stimulatory effects of PPD have been initially proposed to 
be induced by Bandrowski’s base (BB), which is formed by cutaneous 
secondary oxidation products.
However, it was then discovered that elevated levels of BB were 
discovered in both PPD-allergic and PPD-tolerant individuals, but 
the formation of BB does not necessarily trigger immune response 
in the PPD-tolerant individuals [74]. T-cell responses, as measured 
by the lymphocyte transformation test, were only observed in PPD-
allergic individuals. In general, increased activity of T helper 2 
cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1α, -1β, -4, -5, -6, -8, -10, and 
-13; interferon-γ; tumor necrosis factor-α; macrophage inflammatory 
proteins-1α/β; monocyte chemotactic protein-1; and RANTES in CD4+ 
and CD8+ lymphocytes were observed in the allergic patients. Hence, 
it is likely that primary oxidation products of PPD are responsible for 
causing the allergy contact dermatitis. The same group later reported 
an alternative mechanism of PPD in which PPD selectively binds to Citation: hong HP, Reena K, Ng KY, Koh RY, Ng CH, et al.  (2016) para-Phenylenediamine Containing Hair Dye: An Overview of Mutagenicity,

Cysteine-34 of human serum albumin to form a PPD hapten-protein 
complex to stimulate T lymphocytes in the allergic patients [75]. 
Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of how PPD triggers allergic 
response is not well understood. More studies are still required to 
warrant the earlier findings.
With the spotlight highlighting cases of PPD users developed 
adverse effects, occupational hazards come into question. 
Epidemiological studies show that hairdressers have 4.4-fold chance 
of having sensitization towards PPD whereas black henna tattoo 
artists’ chances are 2.3 folds. Other study has shown hairdressers 
have 72% tendency to obtain contact dermatitis compared to 37% in 
cosmetologists [71,76,77]. In Australia, similar results were seen with 
157/164 hairdressers tested positive for occupational contact dermatitis. 
Acute contact dermatitis was seen in 71% of the volunteers whereas 
irritant contact dermatitis was seen in 20%. The average prevalence of 
contact dermatitis relating to PPD is 4.3% in Asia, 4% in Europe and 
6.2% in North America [78,79]. A retrospective study in Sweden found 
significant increase in sensitization rate of PPD from 1992 to 2009 
[80]. Strong and extremely strong patch test reactions are significantly 
more profound in Southern Europe. However, a 20-year study in China 
reported no statistical significant increase of sensitization to PPD [81]. 
Over the years, the prevalence of PPD sensitization has remained the 
same.
Children are more prone for to contact dermatitis pertaining to 
PPD usage, especially in black henna tattooers [82-84]. A retrospective 
study shows +++ reactions to PPD in children age 1 to 14 [85,86]. This 
is because children are more easily developing allergy. A retrospective 
study on 500 children showed 27% of the subjects demonstrating + or 
> + in the patch test. A similar study in University General Hospital 
Consortium of Valencia consists of 726 children reported 47.6% 
positive patch tests and 59% positive for atopic dermatitis. In a cohort 
study, adolescence to adulthood have high incident rate of contact 
allergy and allergic contact dermatitis, mostly towards nickel [83,87].
Conclusion
PPD containing permanent hair dyes account for three-quarters of 
global use and their adverse effects including allergy, mutagenicity and 
toxicity have been debated for more than a decade. Allergic reaction 
testing should be done prior to hair dyeing to minimise the chance 
of getting allergy and contact dermatitis. The mutagenicity test shows 
that while PPD is only slightly mutagenic, oxidised PPD is strongly 
mutagenic. On the other hand, PPD metabolites MAPPD and DAPPD 
are not mutagenic. There is no definite conclusion whether PPD 
increases risk of cancer based on epidemiological studies; but there is 
an increased incidence of tumor in animal studies. Moreover, results 
showed that PPD induced apoptosis through various pathways in a few 
cell lines. Taken together, PPD possesses health hazards to human body 
and it is not recommended to use the chemical frequently.
