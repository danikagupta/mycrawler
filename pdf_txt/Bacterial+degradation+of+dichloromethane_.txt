The uncontrolled release of the industrial solvent methylene chloride, also known as
dichloromethane (DCM), has resulted in widespread groundwater contamination in the
United States. Here we investigate the role of groundwater bacterial communities in
the natural attenuation of DCM at an undisclosed manufacturing site in New Jersey.
This study investigates the bacterial community structure of groundwater samples
differentially contaminated with DCM to better understand the biodegradation potential
of these autochthonous bacterial communities. Bacterial community analysis was
completed using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of groundwater
samples ( nD26) with DCM contamination ranging from 0.89 to 9,800,000 mg/L.
Signiﬁcant DCM concentration-driven shifts in overall bacterial community structure
were identiﬁed between samples, including an increase in the abundance of Firmicutes
within the most contaminated samples. Across all samples, a total of 6,134 unique
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identiﬁed, with 16 taxa having strong
correlations with increased DCM concentration. Putative DCM degraders such as
Pseudomonas, Dehalobacterium and Desulfovibrio were present within groundwater
across all levels of DCM contamination. Interestingly, each of these taxa dominated
speciﬁc DCM contamination ranges respectively. Potential DCM degrading lineages yet

thrived within the most heavily contaminated groundwater samples. Co-occurrence

ﬁrst in situ bacterial community assessment of contaminated groundwater harboring
DCM concentrations ranging over seven orders of magnitude. Diversity analyses

concentration ranges, indicating niche-speciﬁc responses of these autochthonous
populations. Altogether, our ﬁndings suggest that monitored natural attenuation is an

INTRODUCTION
Uncontrolled spills of dichloromethane, or DCM, have been
documented to cause widespread groundwater contamination
across the United States (Robinson et al., 2009). Due to its
carcinogenic and potentially lethal eﬀects in humans (Program,
1986; Miligi et al., 2006; EPA, 2011; Gold et al., 2011; Schlosser
et al., 2015) the US Environmental Protection Agency has set
stringent maximum contamination limit of DCM at 5 parts per
billion ( mg/L) in public or private well water sources (EPA, 2011).
The DCM is a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) that
migrates vertically through the unsaturated and the saturated
groundwater zone because of its high relative density. The
DNAPLs can form discontinuous globules or ganglia due to
capillary retention within the pore space of soils or bedrock as
they migrate vertically (Pankow and Cherry, 1996) and can form
pools of high-saturation DNAPL above layers or lenses of lower-
permeability soil and rock media (Seagren et al., 1993; Gerhard
and Kueper, 2003). Sites containing DNAPL mass are long-
term sources of groundwater contamination. Bedrock aquifers
contaminated with DNAPLs are particularly challenging to clean
up due to complexity of the fracture system through which
DNAPL migrates. In addition, high concentrations of DCM can
diﬀuse into porous bedrock matrix creating signiﬁcant secondary
sources of contamination (Chapman and Parker, 2005). As a
result, technology options for cleanup of DNAPL aquifer systems
are often costly and impractical. Therefore, evaluation of the
intrinsic capacity of an aquifer to naturally attenuate DCM is
important to ensure that cleanup decisions are providing clear
beneﬁts and are sustainable.
One key element in understanding the aquifer attenuation
capacity is consideration of the factors that inﬂuence movement
of contaminants. Identifying microbial populations capable of
DCM degradation throughout the contaminant plume can
support a fate and transport evaluation and conﬁrm that
declining trends in concentration are a result of degradation, and
not physical processes such as dilution and/or matrix diﬀusion.
Biodegradation of DCM by a variety of bacterial and
eukaryotic species has been known for more than three
decades (Brunner et al., 1980; Ravi et al., 2013). DCM can
be utilized as a sole carbon and energy source under both
aerobic and anaerobic conditions by several organisms within
contaminated environments (Krausova et al., 2003; MacDonald
and Gordon, 2005). The majority of the known DCM-degraders
are aerobic methylotrophic bacteria, including strains within the
Methylobacterium (Gälli and Leisinger, 1985; Vuilleumier et al.,
2009; Firsova et al., 2010) and Hyphomicrobium (Kohler-Staub
and Leisinger, 1985; Diks and Ottengraf, 1991; Urakami et al.,1995; Nikolausz et al., 2005; Vuilleumier et al., 2011) genera.
Aerobic degradation of DCM by these consortia is catalyzed
by the enzyme DCM dehalogenase, which converts DCM into
two molecules of HCl and formaldehyde (Brunner et al., 1980;
La Roche and Leisinger, 1990). While most DCM-degraders are
aerobic, some bacteria are able to degrade it anaerobically, in
which DCM is transformed to methane, carbon dioxide, and
acetate (Freedman and Gossett, 1991; Stromeyer et al., 1991;
Braus-Stromeyer et al., 1993; Meßmer et al., 1996; Kaufmann
et al., 1998; Mägli et al., 1998; De Best et al., 2000; Kleindienst
et al., 2016). Bioreactor studies performed using DCM-degrading
strains demonstrate that degradation rates are higher under
aerobic conditions compared to anaerobic degradation (Stucki,
1990; De Best et al., 2000). Currently, the literature of DCM-
degrading organisms has focused on microcosm and bioreactor
studies of cultivated organisms. While these studies provide
insights into the identity of some DCM-degraders and molecular
mechanisms involved in DCM degradation, they do not provide
a complete view of the diversity and functional capacity of
microbial communities within contaminated environments.
In our study, we sought to investigate bacterial community
responses to DCM within groundwater, and identify distinct
assemblages of bacteria capable of thriving in DCM-rich
environments. Bacterial community structure was assessed
within a groundwater DCM DNAPL source and dissolved
phase plume from an undisclosed manufacturing facility
in New Jersey. 16S rRNA analysis was conducted on 26
groundwater samples collected from wells with levels of
contamination ranging from 0.89 to 9,800,000 mg/L. We
found that bacterial community structure shifted across DCM
contamination level such that increasing DCM contamination
enriched unique DCM-degrading assemblages within these
groundwater environments. This represents the ﬁrst study to
leverage a high-throughput sequencing technology to assess
the comprehensive bacterial community response to varying
concentrations of DCM in groundwater environments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Site Description
An underground storage tank was used for DCM and discharged
an unknown quantity of DNAPL into the subsurface prior to
1986. Although the former tanks and contaminated soils were
removed in 1989 and 1990, DCM-contaminated groundwater
in the bedrock aquifer remain at depth with concentrations
detected greater than 10,000,000 parts per billion ( mg/L).
A groundwater pump and treat system was operated from 1995

Wright et al. Bacterial Community Dynamics in Dichloromethane-Contaminated Groundwater
to 2009 as the original cleanup plan, but dissolved concentrations
remained orders of magnitude above cleanup goal of 5 mg/L.
In addition, the system was not removing signiﬁcant amounts
of DCM mass and the data indicated that the pump and
treat system did not have an appreciable eﬀect on the plume
extent. The system was shut oﬀ permanently in 2009 and a
study was initiated to evaluate the attenuation capacity of the
aquifer and determine a revised remedial strategy. While high
contaminant levels persist, overall concentrations in the source
area have been relatively stable, with a downward trend in
concentrations in the down gradient plume indicating that the
plume is stable and retracting. A site map generated within
Inkscape (version 0.91) detailing the sampling well distribution
as well as the origin of the DCM spill is presented in
Figure 1 .
Geology/Hydrogeology
The site is underlain by unconsolidated weathered shale of
the Passaic formation, above fractured shale bedrock, with
bedrock as shallow as 10 feet below grade. The static depth
to water in the bedrock aquifer is approximately 25 feet
below the ground surface (bgs). The low conductivity of the
bedrock onsite results in low yielding wells, typically 0.5–2.5
gallons per minute overall. Two laterally extensive water-bearing
zones at depths of approximately 40 feet (referred as shallow
“S” in the well designation) and 70 feet bgs (referred to as
intermediate “I” in the well designation) across the site contain
the majority of groundwater contamination. However, one
deeper well, WW-58D, screened at a depth of 120–140 feet bgs
has exhibited signiﬁcant concentrations and so was included in
this study.Sample Collection
Groundwater samples ( nD26) were collected quarterly starting
in October of 2013 until August 2014 from 10 groundwater
sampling wells surrounding the spill site. Wells chosen for
bacterial community analysis were selected based on historical
geochemical data to obtain a sample distribution among
relatively high DCM contamination levels (47S, 33I, 01I, 34I),
wells with moderate contamination (46I, 48I, 58D), and wells
with low DCM concentrations (42S, 51I, 56S). Table 1 provides
a comprehensive summary of well identiﬁcations, sampling
information and measured water chemical parameters within
each collected sample.
Adherence to New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (NJDEP) sterile sampling methods was maintained,
and the Volume-Averaged Purging and Sample Collection
method (New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
[NJDEP], 2005) was utilized for this project. Wells were purged
using a submersible pump, which was decontaminated before
purging at each well. At each location, the pump was positioned
one foot above the screened or open hole interval and, where
well productivity allowed, three well volumes were purged. In
wells with poor productivity, purging was halted when the water
level dropped to the pump intake. The well was then allowed
to recharge, a minimum of 1 h, prior to collecting analytical
samples. Flow rate, volume purged, and water quality parameters
including ORP , pH, temperature, turbidity, speciﬁc conductivity,
and dissolved oxygen were recorded at the beginning of purging,
after each well volume extracted, and at the time of sample
collection.
A new TeﬂonRlined bailer was lowered twice for analytical
sampling at each location, ﬁrst for VOC analyses, then again
FIGURE 1 | A sitemap of the contamination zone was generated in Inkscape (version 0.91) by editing a CADD base-map used in groundwater sampling report
submittals. Additional monitoring wells not included in 16S rRNA analysis as well as site location details were removed from the map. Site investigation data suggest
that the DCM spill originated from the former Underground Storage Tank (UST) area (highlighted in green) and migrated downward and to the northwest, primarily
controlled by joint and bedding plane fracture permeability, consequently increasing DCM concentration within wells 47S, 01I, 33I, and 34I.

to collect additional volume for microbial analysis. To increase
microbial density, the bailer was used to agitate sediments at
the bottom of the well before being brought to the surface for
collection.
Water Chemistry
For each quarterly sampling event, water chemistry parameters
were assessed both in the ﬁeld and in the laboratory. Parameters
to assess geochemistry include pH and dissolved oxygen. Water
quality parameters were collected using a using an YSI 556 seriesmulti-meter nested within a ﬂow through cell, except at the time
of analytical sample collection, when a ﬂow through cell was not
used. DCM and other volatile organic compounds were analyzed
in the laboratory by Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometry
using EPA method 624 (EPA, 1984).
Sample Preparation and DNA Extraction
Groundwater samples underwent centrifugation at 10,000
revolutions/minute for 10 min using a Sorvall RCB5 Superspeed
Centrifuge (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, United States).

The supernatant from each sample was discarded, and the pellet
was transferred with a scalpel to a sterile 10 ml Falcon tube
(Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, United States). Nucleic
acid extractions were performed on approximately 0.25 g of each
sediment pellet ( nD26) using a MoBio Powersoil DNA Isolation
kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (MoBio Carlsbad,
CA, United States). The cell-disruption step was performed
using the Disruptor Genie cell disruptor (Scientiﬁc Industries,
Bohemia, NY , United States). The resulting genomic DNA was
eluted in 50 mL of 10 mM Tris.
Acridine Orange Direct Counts
Samples were ﬁltered through a 0.2 mm pore size black
polycarbonate membrane (Whatman International Ltd.,
Piscataway, NJ, United States). Filtered cells were stained with
25-mg/ml acridine orange for 2 min in the dark. Unbound
acridine orange was ﬁltered through the membrane with 10 ml
ﬁlter sterilized 1X PBS (Sigma–Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MI,
United States) and the rinsed membrane was mounted on a slide
for microscopy. Cells were imaged with a FITC ﬁlter on a Zeiss
Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Germany).
16S rRNA Library Preparation and Gene
Sequencing
Ampliﬁcation of the 16S rRNA gene was performed via Illumina
Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR), using an MJ Research PTC-
200 thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and
carried out with the following cycling conditions: 98C for 3 min,
followed by 35 cycles of ampliﬁcation (98C for 1 min, 55C for
40 s, and 72C for 1 min), then 72C for 10 min and kept at
4C. Pooled PCR products were gel puriﬁed using the Qiagen Gel
Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen, Frederick, MD, United States) and then
quantiﬁed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, United States). Prior to submission for sequencing,
libraries were validated using the 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 1000
chip (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).
Pooled libraries were stored at  20C until they were shipped
on dry ice to the California State University Northridge for
sequencing. Library pools were size veriﬁed using the Fragment
Analyzer CE (Advanced Analytical Technologies Inc., Ames, IA,
United States) and quantiﬁed using the Qubit High Sensitivity
dsDNA kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States).
Sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq v2 Reagent
Kit with 16S rRNA library sequencing primers and set for 150
base, paired-end reads.
Bioinformatics and Statistical Analyses
Sequences were trimmed at a length of 150 bp and quality ﬁltered
at an expected error of less than 1% using USEARCH v7 (Edgar,
2013). After quality ﬁltering, reads were analyzed using the
QIIME 1.9.0 pipeline (Caporaso et al., 2010, 2011). Chimeric
sequences were identiﬁed using USEARCH61 (Edgar, 2010).
A total of 1.7 million sequences were obtained after quality
ﬁltering and chimera checking. Open reference operational
taxonomic units (OTUs) were picked using the USEARCH61
algorithm (Edgar, 2010), and taxonomy assignment wasperformed using the Greengenes 16S rRNA gene database
(13-5 release, 97%) (DeSantis et al., 2006). Assigned taxonomy
were organized into a BIOM formatted OTU table, which was
summarized within QIIME 1.9.0. OTUs that were not classiﬁed
at the kingdom taxonomic rank were discarded. Additionally,
18 potential DCM-degrading OTUs identiﬁed in previous
literature were summarized and quantiﬁed within each DCM
concentration grouping. Relative abundances were organized
in a table format. Relative abundances of the 10 most abundant
potential DCM-degrading bacteria were plotted within Microsoft
Excel.
Alpha diversity rarefaction curves were generated within
the QIIME 1.9.0 sequence analysis package using an unrariﬁed
OTU table. Multiple rarefactions were conducted on sequences
across all samples from minimum depth of 0 sequences, to a
maximum depth of 8,000 sequences, with a step size of 1,000
sequences/sample for 20 iterations. Alpha rarefactions were then
collated and plotted using Heip’s Evenness and observed species
richness metrics. Alpha diversity was compared between DCM
concentration groupings as well as sampling well. Alpha diversity
comparisons were conducted using a two-sample t-test and non-
parametric Monte Carlo permutations ( nD999).
Beta diversity was calculated using the weighted UniFrac
distance metric and visualized with Principle Coordinates
Analysis (PCoA) in EMPeror (Vázquez-Baeza et al., 2013).
Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) was used to test diﬀerences
in community structure within the samples (1000 Monte Carlo
permutations) grouped by sampling location. Adonis tests were
performed on weighted UniFrac distance matrices to determine
the amount of variation explained by sampling well and measured
continuous parameters. Alpha levels of 0.05 were used to detect
signiﬁcance of categorical or continuous variables. Directional
PCoA plots were plotted with samples distributed along the x-axis
based on increasing DCM concentrations that underwent log C1
transformation.
Variability of sample distribution within Euclidean space
was assessed through the calculation of average weighted
UniFrac distance between samples within the same DCM
concentration grouping. Spearman correlations were calculated
in R studio to examine the relationship between continuous water
chemical variables and taxa abundance. Kruskal–Wallis tests
for signiﬁcance were calculated using an unrariﬁed OTU table
within QIIME with “DCM grouping” chosen as the comparison
category to reveal enriched taxa in each concentration group.
Taxa unclassiﬁed at the kingdom level were not shown.
A row containing DCM concentrations for each sample was
appended to the bottom of a CSS normalized OTU table. The
heatmap.2 function within the gplots package for R Studio was
used to generate an abundance heatmap. Dendrogram plotting
was turned on to include the clustering of the samples and genera.
Operational taxonomic unit networks were generated within
QIIME 1.9.0 from an OTU table rariﬁed to a sequencing
depth of 3000 sequences per sample to account for diﬀerential
sequencing bias. OTUs unclassiﬁed at the genus taxonomic
rank were removed. Networks were plotted and visualized
using the AllegroLayout plugin within the data visualization
tool Cytoscape-3.2.1. DCM degrading taxa of interest were

highlighted manually. A Co-occurrence network was created
with the Cytoscape plugin Conet. An unrariﬁed OTU table
was uploaded into the program with DCM-concentration
selected as the metadata feature. Parameters where set to reveal
co-occurrence patterns that correlated above a 0.9 Spearman’s test
to reveal the 100 top and bottom most results. A command line
was generated from the Conet Cytoscape plugin and executed in a
command prompt. A GDL network created by the command line
was uploaded into the Conet plugin to complete visualization.
Nodes of interest where then selected and a separate network was
created from the nodes of interest and their immediate neighbors.
RESULTS
Groundwater Chemistry
Distinct diﬀerences in measured water chemical parameters
were observed between groundwater samples collected
in this study. DCM concentration ( mg/L) spanned seven
orders of magnitude (0.89–9,800,000 mg/L) and displayed the
greatest diﬀerence amongst measured variables within the
groundwater ( Table 1 ). pH ranged from 4.44 to 8.40 units.
Samples were grouped by increasing DCM concentration for
alpha and beta diversity analysis in the following manner:
0–10mg/L ( nD10), 10–100 mg/L ( nD5), 10,000–100,000 mg/L
(nD4), 100,000–1,000,000 mg/L ( nD3), and 1,000,000–
10,000,000 mg/L ( nD4). Though cell counts revealed higher
biomass concentration (1.50E C07 to 1.44EC08 cells/ml)
in groundwater with DCM concentrations <100mg/L
compared to cell counts (3.76E C06 to 1.86EC07
cells/ml) from samples >10,000 mg/L, diﬀerences werenot statistically signiﬁcant ( p> 0.05) (Supplementary
Table S1).
Microbial Community Diversity
Species richness analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences
revealed a robust bacterial community existed in the groundwater
at this site. Alpha diversity analysis of observed taxa resulted
in 274–984 unique bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units
(OTUs >97%) within the groundwater samples (Supplementary
Figure S1). Groundwater with DCM concentrations <10mg/L
possessed nearly the same number of observed OTUs
(observed speciesD528; nD10) compared to samples
with>1,000,000 mg/L DCM (observed species D487; nD4),
but diﬀerences were not signiﬁcant ( p>0.05). No signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between any two DCM concentration groupings
were observed when comparing both species richness and
evenness. Alpha rarefaction curves appeared to reach a
horizontal asymptote as sampling depth increased, indicating
the level of sequencing conducted nearly saturated observed
diversity.
Phylum-level taxonomic assignments of 16S rRNA gene
sequences revealed shifts in overall bacterial community
structure with respect to DCM concentration ( Figure 2 ).
Proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum across all
DCM concentration groupings, ranging from 21.4 to 67%
of sample composition. Proteobacteria sequence abundance
decreased 25.9% in samples with higher ( >1000 mg/L)
DCM concentrations when compared to samples with lower
(<1000mg/L) DCM concentrations. Conversely, Firmicutes were
13.9% more abundant in samples with DCM concentrations
>1,000 mg/L when compared to samples with <1,000 mg/L
FIGURE 2 | Relative abundance summaries of bacterial phyla reveal differences in general microbial community structure in groundwater samples grouped by
increasing dichloromethane (DCM) concentration ( n= 26). Plots were generated from an unrariﬁed OTU table within QIIME 1.9.0. The 6 most abundant phyla across
all samples are shown, with remaining taxa grouped in an “other” category. Shifts in general bacterial community structures in response to increased DCM
concentration were observed. Proteobacteria were identiﬁed as the most abundant phylum across all samples, with average relative abundances comprising a range
of 21.4–57% of the bacterial community within each group. A decrease in the average relative abundance of Proteobacteria was observed in samples with

noted in samples >100,000 mg/L DCM. Shifts in phylum relative abundances serve as a primary indication of microbial community responses to increased DCM
concentration.

FIGURE 3 | (A,B) Principal Coordinates Analyses (PCoA) plots were utilized to visualize differences in microbial community structure between groundwater samples
grouped by well (A)and DCM concentration (B). PCoA plots were generated from a weighted UniFrac distance matrix calculated within QIIME 1.9.0. (A)Samples
are colored based on sampling well. Distinct clustering of samples can be observed within wells 01I (red), 33I (blue), 46I (purple), 47S (yellow), and 48I (teal). Sample
clustering based on well was considered to be signiﬁcant (ANOSIM, p= 0.001) and accounted for 55% of variation in microbial community structure between
samples (adonis p= 0.001). (B)A directional PCoA plot distributes samples along the x-axis by increasing DCM concentrations that underwent log + 1
transformations. Clustering of samples with higher DCM concentrations can be observed. DCM concentration ( mg/L) was found to cause signiﬁcant shifts (10%,
adonis p= 0.004) in microbial community structure. Variability between samples signiﬁcantly decreases as DCM concentrations rise (Z score = 3.17, Mann–Whitney
U P1 = 0.0009, P2 = 0.015), indicative of a shaping toward a deﬁned microbial community structure as DCM increases.

concentration. Additionally, average relative abundances for
Chlamydiae in sample groups with DCM concentrations ranging
from 100,000–1,000,000 mg/L and 1,000,000–10,000,000 mg/L
were 18.6 and 3.4%, respectively, but only account for 0.3% ofthe total microbial community structure of samples with DCM
concentrations <1000mg/L.
Beta diversity analyses revealed signiﬁcant clustering by
sampling location and DCM concentration, as visualized by
principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots ( Figures 3A,B ).
PCoA plots showed discrete bacterial community structures
within wells 47S, 01I, 33I, 46I, and 48I (ANOSIM, pD0.001)
(Figure 3A ). Sampling location explained the most (55%)
variation in bacterial community structure between samples
(Adonis, pD0.001). Directional PCoA plots showed a
strong relationship between DCM concentration and bacterial
community composition, as exempliﬁed by clustering of samples
with DCM concentrations >10,000 mg/L ( Figure 3B ). DCM
concentration explained 10% of variation in beta diversity
between samples (Adonis, pD0.004). Samples with DCM
concentrations ranging from 1,000,000–10,000,000 mg/L formed
a distinct cluster from the remaining cohorts at the bottom
of the PC1 axis, and to the back of the PC2 axis. Greater
phylogenetic variation was observed between samples with DCM
concentrations <1,000 mg/L in comparison to samples with
>10,000 mg/L. Samples with >10,000 mg/L DCM observed
signiﬁcantly less variation between samples when compared to
the<1,000mg/L DCM cohort ( ZscoreD3.17, Mann–Whitney

Of all collected continuous water chemistry data, DCM
concentration was found to correlate strongly (spearman’s

FIGURE 4 | Abundance plots present the relative abundances of the 10 most abundant potential DCM-degrading taxa of interest within the groundwater samples
grouped by DCM concentration. Plots were generated from an unrariﬁed OTU table, and present the average relative abundances of 10 potential DCM degrading
OTUs within each DCM concentration grouping. A unique DCM-degrading consortium was identiﬁed within each group of groundwater samples. Over 20% of the
total 16S rRNA gene sequences within the most contaminated samples (1,000,000–10,000,000 mg/L DCM) were assigned to the Desulfosporosinus genus, more
than double the relative abundance identiﬁed in any other group. This highly contaminated group also observed the largest relative abundance (2.6%) of
Desulfovibrio , while samples with DCM concentrations from 100,000 to 1,000,000 mg/L DCM possessed a high average abundance (7.4%) of Unclassiﬁed
Pseudomonadaceae. Dehalobacterium were observed in greatest abundance (5.1%) within samples with DCM concentrations ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 mg/L
DCM. Pseudomonas sequences were most abundant in samples with lower DCM concentrations (100–1,000 mg/L DCM), with an average relative abundance of
3.4%. Samples with the lowest DCM concentrations (0–10 mg/L DCM) were the only set of groundwater samples that was not dominated by any speciﬁc known
DCM-degrading taxa. The data suggests that different levels of DCM may promote a unique environment conducive to niche-speciﬁc DCM-degrading taxa.

FIGURE 5 | Relative abundance heatmap of potential DCM-degrading biomarker taxa. This heatmap displays the abundance of 29 taxa previously associated with
growth on DCM or similar contaminants within each groundwater sample ( n= 26). Taxa of high abundances are highlighted in red, whereas taxa of low abundance
are highlighted in green. Samples with higher DCM concentrations possess the highest abundances of biomarker taxa of interest, with as much as a four order of
magnitude difference in abundance in comparison to samples of lower DCM concentration. As a result, samples of high DCM concentration appear to cluster
together on the right side of the plot. Unclassiﬁed Clostridiales, Clostridium ,Candidatus Methanoregula ,Dehalobacterium ,Desulfovibrio ,Desulfosporosinus ,
Pseudomonas , and Unclassiﬁed Methylophilaceae are present in the highest abundance within the high DCM concentration samples. The data suggest that the
presence and abundance of the potential DCM degrading taxa of interest may be driving the observed shift in microbial community structure with increased DCM
concentration. A majority of the anaerobic DCM degraders are observed in higher within the samples with higher levels of contamination, but do not thrive within
samples with lower contamination. Clustering of samples further supports the ﬁnding of niche-speciﬁc DCM degrading assemblages within samples of similar DCM
concentrations.
of 16 taxa, including known degraders such as Dehalobacterium ,
Acetobacterium , and Desulfovibrio aminophilus had strong
positive correlations with DCM concentration ( Table 2 ).
Many taxa possessing strong positive correlations with DCM
concentration were unclassiﬁed beyond the family taxonomic
rankings, including Unclassiﬁed Ruminococcaceae, Unclassiﬁed
Elusimicrobiales, TM7-[Blgi18], Unclassiﬁed Bacteroidales
and Unclassiﬁed Endomicrobia. Two OTUs assigned to the
Methylomonas genus were the only taxa negatively correlated
with DCM concentration ( Table 2 ). Dissolved oxygen (DO)
(mg/L) was found to correlate positively with a total of 4 unique
OTUs ( p>0.65), including Pirellulaceae, Ruminococcaceae,
Chloroﬂexi Ellin 6529, and Gemmatimonadetes KD8-87

with measured water chemical parameters can be found in
Supplementary Table S2. pH ﬂuctuated between sampling wells,
with site 01I possessing the lowest average pH (5.25) and well

the highest average pH (7.69) of all sampling wells with at least 3
samples included in our 16S investigation. Within well 01I, theGeobacter, Magnetospirillum, and the Dehalobacter were the 3
most abundant genera, with relative abundances at 13.26, 13.12,

Cloacibacterium , and Hymenobacter were most abundant, with
relative abundances at 15.08, 9.17, and 7.54%, respectively.
The relative abundance of potential DCM-degrading bacteria
increased with groundwater DCM concentration. The total
relative abundance of these potential DCM-degrading taxa
increased from 7.5 to 28.6% from the least (0–10 mg/L DCM) to

FIGURE 6 | Co-occurrence network plot reveals strong positive and negative correlations (Spearman’s rho >0.9) between OTU abundances. A co-occurrence
network generated from an unrariﬁed OTU table containing bacterial abundance data from all 26 groundwater samples was created within the Cytoscape plugin
Conet. All taxa unassigned at the kingdom taxonomic ranking are not shown. Only strong correlations (spearman’s rho >0.9) were included in the network.
Potential DCM-degrading taxonomy are highlighted in orange, with all remaining taxa highlighted in gray. Green edges connecting two nodes are indicative of a
strong correlation (spearman’s rho >0.9) between the taxa, whereas red edges are indicative of a strong negative correlation (spearman’s rho <–0.9). It can be
observed that 2 distinct clusters form at the right and left of the plot, with aerobic DCM degrading bacteria (Pseudomonas and Methylobacterium ) identiﬁed in the left
cluster, and potential anaerobic degraders ( Desulfosporosinus and Clostridiales) on the right. Strong positive correlations can be observed between the potential
DCM-degrader Desulfosporosinus and three unique Treponema OTUs in addition to Candidatus Methanoregula ,Acinetobacter ,Geobacter , and unclassiﬁed
Clostridiales. Methylomonas andCellvibrio were the only taxa calculated to have strong negative correlations (spearman’s rho <–0.9) with Desulfosporosinus . The
unclassiﬁed Clostridiales taxon was also found to correlate strongly with Treponema , in addition to six other non DCM-degrading OTUs. Two unique OTUs assigned
to the pseudomonas genus were found to have strong positive correlations with Flavobacterium ,Pedobacter , and Methylotenera , and strong negative correlations
with Sulfurospirillium , unclassiﬁed Anaerolineales, Candidatus Methylomirabilis andSulfuricurvum . Potential DCM-degraders appear to correlate with speciﬁc

sequences in comparison to all other DCM concentration
groupings. Dehalobacterium were observed in low abundance
(<1%) across all DCM concentration groupings, except
for samples with 10,000–100,000 mg/L DCM, in which it
composed 5.1% of the microbial community. Pseudomonas
sequences were most abundant in samples with DCM
contamination ranging from 10 to 1,000 mg/L, with an average
relative abundance of 3.4%. Samples with less than 10 mg/L
DCM were not dominated by any known DCM-degrading
taxa.
Sampling wells 34I and 01I observed the greatest variation
in DCM concentration in comparison to all remaining wells
(Table 1 ). A heatmap of potential DCM-degrading assemblages
within these sites revealed ﬂuctuations in DCM degrading
assemblages within both sampling locations (Supplementary
Figure S2). Clustering of samples when considering DCM
degrading OTUs within 34I and 01I appears to be driven by DCM
concentration, rather than sampling location, as samples of lower
DCM concentration are clustered to the right of the heatmap
with lower counts of DCM degrading assemblages. The relative
abundance of Desulfosporosinus increases within well 01I from
1.5 to 6.99% in response to increased DCM concentration. Within
well 34I, an increased abundance (3.1%) of Dehalobacterium
can be observed within sample 34I-101 (46,000 mg/L DCM).
Samples 34I-100 (690 mg/L DCM) and 34I-102 (790,000 mg/L
DCM) yielded relative abundances of Dehalobacterium below
0.5%. Both of these trends mirror ﬂuctuations in DCM degrading
taxa abundances when considering the entire dataset ( Figure 5 ).
A total of 42 OTUs were enriched in samples with
DCM concentrations above 10,000 mg/L DCM (Kruskal–Wallis
p<0.004) (Supplementary Table S3). When consideringDCM concentration groupings 0–10 mg/L DCM and 10–
100mg/L DCM, no signiﬁcantly enriched bacterial taxa were
identiﬁed (Supplementary Table S3). A two-way heatmap
presenting the relative abundance of potential DCM-degrading
biomarker taxa displayed clustering of samples with DCM
concentrations >10,000 mg/L ( Figure 5 ). The relative abundance
16S rRNA gene sequences matching to potential DCM-degrading
biomarker taxa were highest in samples of DCM concentration
>10,000 mg/L, with as much as a four-fold increase in their
relative percentage of the total community in comparison
to samples of DCM concentration <1,000 mg/L, including
Dehalobacterium and Desulfosporosinus . The enrichment in
putative DCM-degrading taxa in more contaminated samples is
further supported by the core microbiome analysis, which reveals
the presence of 40 core OTUs that have been identiﬁed as DCM-
degraders in highly contaminated samples (DCM concentrations
>10,000 mg/L DCM), as compared to only ﬁve potential DCM-
degrading core OTUs within less contaminated samples (DCM
concentration <1,000mg/L DCM (Supplementary Figure S3).
Co-occurrence network analysis revealed a variety of
positive and negative correlations amongst members of
these complex bacterial communities. For example, several
positive interactions exist between putative DCM-degrading
assemblages and bacteria yet to be associated with DCM
degradation ( Figure 6 ). Interestingly, two distinct sub-
networks were observed, which map to both aerobic DCM
degrading taxa ( Pseudomonas and Methylobacterium ) anaerobic
degraders ( Desulfosporosinus and Clostridiales). Two unique
Pseudomonas OTUs as well as a Methylobacterium OTU had
strong positive correlations with both Flavobacterium and

DISCUSSION
Bacterial community composition was investigated in
groundwater collected from a site undergoing natural attenuation
to treat a DCM source area and dissolved phase plume in a
fractured bedrock. High throughput sequencing of the 16S
rRNA gene allowed for comprehensive analysis of bacterial
community structure associated with DCM-contaminated
groundwater. While there was little observed variability in
bacterial concentration and richness across the groundwater
samples, distinctive shifts in bacterial community composition
were observed with respect to the DCM concentration. Bacterial
community analyses of these groundwater environments
revealed a surprisingly robust and diverse community within
these DCM-contaminated environments. The observed bacterial
community structure was shaped by variation in DCM
concentrations, and putative novel taxa that correlate with
DCM concentration were identiﬁed in these groundwater
environments. This study represents the ﬁrst community-wide
assessment of in situ bacterial community diversity in DCM-
contaminated groundwater using high-throughput sequencing
technologies.
Alpha diversity analyses revealed a robust bacterial
community within even the most highly DCM-contaminated
groundwater samples, and consequently species richness
did not change signiﬁcantly between DCM concentration
groupings. Previous research has found similarities in alpha
diversity between groundwater samples with varying levels of
trichloroethylene (TCE) (Lee et al., 2012) and total chlorine
(Imfeld et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2014; Stanish et al., 2016)
indicating that the indigenous microbial community is capable
of withstanding and even utilizing chlorinated hydrocarbons
in highly contaminated scenarios. Other molecular studies
that have measured community-wide responses to DCM, have
also suggested the existence diverse microbial communities
associated with DCM-impacted environments (Leisinger et al.,
1994; Dojka et al., 1998; Vuilleumier et al., 2001; Muller et al.,
2011; Justicia-Leon et al., 2012). While hydrocarbon release
into groundwater has been cited to cause a brief reduction in
species richness directly after a spill, longitudinal studies show no
signiﬁcant reduction in diversity over time (Röling et al., 2002;
Hernandez-Raquet et al., 2006; Alonso-Gutiérrez et al., 2009;
Abed et al., 2014).
The lower biomass in higher concentration DCM
groundwater samples could in part be due to toxicity of DCMand its conversion. The bacterial toxicity of DCM transformation
has been previously described (Thier et al., 1993; Gisi et al., 1999;
Kayser and Vuilleumier, 2001).
Previous work has also documented the toxicity to
methanotrophic populations at DCM concentrations above
780mM (Byers and Sly, 1993). While cell concentrations were
slightly lower in highly contaminated groundwater samples,
alpha diversity estimates revealed a robust bacterial community
still persisted, even at DCM concentrations above 9.8 million
mg/L. Future work, including metatranscriptomics, will enable
the investigation of the activity of these bacterial assemblages
within contaminated groundwater, revealing which organisms
can survive and possibly contribute to the active degradation
of DCM.
Beta diversity analyses assessed diﬀerences in phylogenetic
distance between the samples and revealed a distinct bacterial
community associated with samples with elevated DCM
groundwater concentrations ( Figures 3A,B ). Chlorinated
organics have been found to shape microbial communities in
sediment (Lee et al., 2012; Hamonts et al., 2014; Atashgahi
et al., 2016) and groundwater (Dojka et al., 1998; Park and
Noguera, 2004; Zaa et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012; Rossi et al., 2012;
Kao et al., 2016). Variation in bacterial community structures
between sampling wells was also, in part, related to diﬀerences in
geochemical parameters between the sampling wells as variance-
partitioning analysis indicated. Our ﬁndings are congruent with
previous literature describing the role of ecological-niche factors
such as pH, salinity, and temperature in determining microbial
community composition and function (Park and Noguera, 2004;
Xu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012; Bougouﬀa et al., 2013; Saleem,
2015; Techtmann et al., 2015). Variability in geochemistry had a
signiﬁcant impact not only on microbial community structure,
but the potential mechanism of DCM-degradation as well. Near
the source contamination area, in samples with the highest levels
of DCM contamination, the mechanisms are predominantly
anaerobic, indicative of an environment with less available
free-oxygen as a result of DCM saturation. Elevated abundances
of anaerobic bacteria including Desulfosporosinus, Desulfovibrio,
and unclassiﬁed Clostridiales taxa can be observed in these
highly contaminated sites ( Figure 4 ). Conversely, increased
abundance of aerobic degraders, such as the Pseudomonas , was
noted in lower DCM concentration environments ( Figure 5 ).
This suggests that DCM degrading organisms are abundant
throughout the source area and dissolved phase plume, and that
diﬀerent bacterial assemblages appear to be establishing niches
within speciﬁc DCM concentration ranges.
Several putative DCM-degrading taxa were signiﬁcantly
enriched in speciﬁc groundwater environments. Well-cited DCM
degrading taxa including Dehalobacterium and unclassiﬁed
Methylophilaceae, were highly abundant across groundwater
samples ranging from low to high levels of DCM concentration
(Figures 4 ,5), have both been previously been found to degrade
DCM via a fermentative pathway (Mägli et al., 1998; Justicia-
Leon et al., 2012). Additionally, Desulfovibrio andAcetobacterium
correlated strongly with higher DCM concentrations, and
have been shown to grow rapidly in co-culture during
DCM-exposure (Magli et al., 1995). Both the Desulfovibrio
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 11 November 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 2300fmicb-08-02300 November 20, 2017 Time: 13:36 # 12
Wright et al. Bacterial Community Dynamics in Dichloromethane-Contaminated Groundwater
and Acetobacterium are genera of anaerobic bacteria, further
indicating a shift toward anaerobic degradation in response
to increased DCM concentration (Balch et al., 1977; Madigan,
2012). The sulfate-reducing Desulfosporosinus genus was most
abundant (20.14%) genus within the most contaminated
groundwater samples environments ( >1,000,000 mg/L). This
genus is known to possess genes required for chloroalkane
degradation and have been isolated from groundwater sites
contaminated with gasoline, but has not been cited as a speciﬁc
DCM degrading taxa (Stackebrandt et al., 2003). Both the
Acetobacterium and Desulfosporosinus fall within the Firmicutes,
thus explaining the increased abundance of this phylum within
highly contaminated DCM environments. Previous literature
has shown that bacteria within the Firmicutes can utilize DCM
as a sole carbon source under anoxic conditions (Kleindienst
et al., 2017). The second most abundant genus within the
highly contaminated samples, the Sulfurospirillum, (10.7%), has
yet to be cited as a DCM-degrading taxon, but is a nitrate-
degrader known to compete with sulfate-reducing bacteria,
such as the Desulfosporosinus , for degradable oil organics
(Hubert and Voordouw, 2007). Two other well-cited DCM-
degraders, Pseudomonas and Hyphomicrobium , were observed
in high abundance across all samples, including DCM rich-
samples ( >1,000mg/L), and are capable of aerobic (Guo, 1990;
Vuilleumier et al., 2001; Krausova et al., 2006) and facultatively
anaerobic (Vuilleumier et al., 2001; Nikolausz et al., 2005)
degradation, respectively. The Geobacter were abundant (13.26%)
within well 01I, a site with the lowest average pH reading (5.25)
across all sampling wells. Geobacter are known neutrophiles, and
have been found to thrive in low pH conditions, where they
can mediate ferric iron reduction (Johnson et al., 2012). The
Hydrogenophaga were identiﬁed in greatest abundance within
well 46I, found to possess the highest average pH (8.11). This
genus has been found to grow optimally at pH <7.0, and are
capable of mineralizing methyl tertbutyl ether in groundwater
(Streger et al., 2002; Yoon et al., 2008).
Other bacterial taxa also positively correlated with DCM
concentration but are not yet associated with DCM degradation,
suggesting possible degradation capacities or supportive roles.
Interestingly, two observed clusters of taxa appear to separate
potential aerobic and anaerobic DCM-degrading taxa, indicative
of two diﬀerential networks of bacteria capable of degradation in
oxygenated or anoxic groundwater ( Figure 6 ). The aerobic genus
Pseudomonas has been found to utilize DCM as a secondary
substrate (LaPat-Polasko et al., 1984; Krausova et al., 2006)
and positively correlate with Methylotenera and Flavobacterium
(Bernardet et al., 1996; Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2006). While
Flavobacterium have yet to be associated with DCM degradation,
they have been found to degrade alternative xenobiotics when
grown in co-culture with Pseudomonas (Trzesicka-Mlynarz
and Ward, 1995). Methylotenera has yet to be associated
with DCM degradation as well (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2006).
However, species within the Methylotenera genus have been
found to possess multiple genes required for formaldehyde
activation and metabolism, a byproduct of aerobic DCM
degradation in DCM rich environments (Marx et al., 2003;
Bosch et al., 2009). Both Methylotenera and Flavobacteriumare methylotrophic bacteria found to utilize methane, a
byproduct of DCM degradation, in situ (Hesselsoe et al., 2005;
Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2006; Justicia-Leon et al., 2012; Beck et al.,
2013).
Bacteria including Acinetobacter , Geobacter , and
Treponema exhibited signiﬁcant positive correlations to the
Desulfosporosinus (Figure 6 ). Both Geobacter , and Treponema
members, which correlated positively to the Clostridiales taxa,
have been previously found in groundwater contaminated with
chlorinated organic compounds (Imfeld et al., 2010; Lovley,
2011; Miura et al., 2015). Speciﬁc OTUs not yet linked to
DCM degradation may be enriched as a result of byproduct
accumulation from such processes. Within anaerobic conditions,
DCM is transformed to methane, carbon dioxide, and acetate
during which sulfate, nitrate or ferric iron may act as the
predominant electron acceptors for anaerobic DCM degrading
taxa such as Dehalobacterium and Desulfovibrio (Magli et al.,
1995; De Best et al., 2000; Vuilleumier et al., 2001). Facultative
anaerobes such as Hyphomicrobium and Actinetobacter have
been found to degrade DCM in both aerobic and anaerobic
conditions, capable of growth with either nitrate or oxygen
serving as the terminal electron acceptor (Vuilleumier et al.,
2001).
Our bacterial community proﬁling of these groundwater
environments using high throughput sequencing of the 16S
rRNA gene revealed a distinct shaping of the autochthonous
bacterial communities in response to varying DCM
concentrations. Potential degraders of chlorinated organics
were observed in greater abundances in samples with DCM
concentrations >1000mg/L. Future work such as bacterial
isolation, would enable us to conﬁrm if these potential novel
DCM degrading taxa are able to actively degrade DCM.
Additionally, while extrapolation of 16S rRNA gene data
revealed that the groundwater samples have the potential to
carry out chloroalkane and alkene degradation, future functional
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses will greatly
beneﬁt our understanding of the functional capacity of these
bacterial communities. With such data, functional potential
and expression patterns can help estimate the biodegradation
potential of the microbial community. This would allow us
to potentially identify novel DCM degrading taxa, as well
as distinguish monitored natural attenuation as a useful
bioremediation technique of DCM, which would serve as a cost
eﬃcient beneﬁt to current remediation practices.
