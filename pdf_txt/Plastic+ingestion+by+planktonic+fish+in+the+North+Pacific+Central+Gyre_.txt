Plastic ingestionNorth Paciﬁc Central GyreMarine debrisPlanktivorousPlastic pollutionabstract
A signiﬁcant amount of marine debris has accumulated in the North Paciﬁc Central Gyre (NPCG). The
effects on larger marine organisms have been documented through cases of entanglement and ingestion;
however, little is known about the effects on lower trophic level marine organisms. This study is the ﬁrstto document ingestion and quantify the amount of plastic found in the gut of common planktivorous ﬁshin the NPCG. From February 11 to 14, 2008, 11 neuston samples were collected by manta trawl in the
NPCG. Plastic from each trawl and ﬁsh stomach was counted and weighed and categorized by type, size
class and color. Approximately 35% of the ﬁsh studied had ingested plastic, averaging 2.1 pieces per ﬁsh.Additional studies are needed to determine the residence time of ingested plastics and their effects on
ﬁsh health and the food chain implications.

1. Introduction
The accumulation of marine debris, the majority of which is
plastic ( Derraik, 2002 ), has the potential to negatively impact mar-
ine organisms worldwide. On a broad scale, plastic debris can af-
fect larger marine organisms and impair the quality of aquatic
life. In more speciﬁc terms, large quantities of plastic pieces in
the North Paciﬁc Central Gyre (NPCG) are cause for concern as they
mix with food sources for the area’s planktivorous organisms. The
NPCG is an ocean convergence zone that accumulates debris from
the entire North Paciﬁc ( Ingraham and Ebbesmeyer, 2001 ). In 1999,
Algalita Marine Research Foundation (AMRF) discovered that in the
NPCG neuston plastics outweighed zooplankton by a ratio of 6:1
and averaged over 300,000 pieces per km2(Moore et al., 2001 ).
In 2008, an AMRF neuston trawl survey of the same area found a
dramatic increase in the number of particles per km2to 752,110
(unpublished data). This increase in particles per km2may affect
the ability of ﬁsh to distinguish between plastic and their natural
food.
Plastic debris accumulating in the marine environment is
known to fragment into smaller pieces, which increases the poten-
tial for ingestion by smaller marine organisms ( Browne et al.,
2008 ). Additionally, the buoyancy of smaller pieces of plastic in-
creases the likelihood for mixing with surface food sources.
Although the ingestion of plastic debris by turtles, seabirds, marine
mammals, and occasionally ﬁsh has been well documented ( Balaz,
1985; Wallace, 1985; Ryan et al., 1990; Moser and Lee, 1992;Robards, 1993; Eriksson and Burton, 2003; Phillips et al., 2007 ),
the amount and type of plastic ingested by lower trophic level mar-
ine organisms has not been investigated as vigorously.
The present study is the ﬁrst conducted in the NPCG to conﬁrm
that small ﬁsh are ingesting accumulated plastic and to estimate
the quantity of plastic ingested. More speciﬁcally the goal of this
study is to determine if mesopelagic planktivorous ﬁshes in the
NPCG were ingesting small plastic fragments. The majority of ﬁsh
species collected for this study are members of a family that com-
prise more than half of the world oceans’ total ﬁsh biomass
(Oizumi et al., 2001 ), allowing this study to make a signiﬁcant
contribution to wider understanding of marine debris’ effects on
ocean ﬁsh.
2. Methods
Eleven neuston samples were obtained by manta trawl from
February 11 to 14, 2008. Sampling commenced at 34 /C17640.240N,
142/C17604.5340W and continued in a northerly direction to 36 /C176
05.3220N, 140 /C17641.1180W, then sampling proceeded in an easterly
direction from 36 /C17602.4470N, 140 /C17619.8750Wt o3 5 /C17645.2070N, 138 /C176
21.450W(Fig. 1 ). Tows varied in time and distance, with tow time
ranging from 1.5 to 5.5 h. The manta trawl had a 0.9 /C20.15 m rect-
angular opening and a 3.5 m long 333- lnet with a 30 /C210 cm col-
lection bag. All samples were preserved for analysis by ﬁxing in 5%
formalin, then soaked in fresh water and transferred to 70% isopro-
pyl alcohol.
Fish, plankton, and anthropogenic debris were sorted and pro-
cessed at Southern California Coastal Water Research Project
(SCCWRP) in Costa Mesa, CA. For each ﬁsh, basic metrics were
recorded, including: standard length (mm), standard weight (g),

and sex (male, female, or immature). Each stomach was removed
and examined under a dissecting microscope (see Fig. 2 ). Stomach
contents were sorted into natural (plankton) and non-natural
(plastic) food source groups, then dried at 65 /C176C for 24 h. Dry
weight of the plankton was recorded in grams using a Sartorius
MC1 balance. Plastic pulled from each ﬁsh stomach was catego-
rized by size, color and type (fragment, line, foam, pellet or ﬁlm),
then weighed using a C31-Microbalance.
3. Results
Out of 11 neuston trawls, 6 night trawls and 5 day trawls, 7
trawls contained ﬁsh. Notably, only the 6 night trawls yielded ﬁshthat had ingested plastic. A total of 670 ﬁsh, representing ﬁve
mesopelagic and one epipelagic species, were obtained from 7
trawl samples. The mesopelagic species were: Symbolophorus cali-
forniensis, Myctophum aurolanternatum ,Loweina interrupta and
Hygophum reinhardtii (Family Myctophidae) ,and Astronesthes indo-
paciﬁca (Family Stomiidae). The epipelagic species was Cololabis
saira (Family Scomberesocidae). The most commonly caught spe-
cies was M. aurolanternatum (69%), followed by S. californiensis
(11%), C. saira (8%), H. reinhardtii (7%), L. interrupta (4%) and ﬁnally
A. indopaciﬁca (1%).
Approximately 35% of the ﬁsh examined had plastic pieces in
their guts. A total of 1375 pieces of plastic, ranging from 1 to 83
pieces per ﬁsh and averaging 2.1 pieces (±5.78) per ﬁsh, were col-lected from ﬁsh guts. M. aurolanternatum and S. californiensis , had
the highest average number of pieces at 6.0 pieces (±8.99) and
7.2 pieces (±8.39), respectively ( Table 1 ). The average weight of
plastic retrieved from ﬁsh followed a similar pattern, with the
average mass of total plastic 1.57 mg (±4.755) per ﬁsh. The two
most common species sampled had ingested the highest masses
of plastic; M. aurolanternatum averaged 4.66 mg (±7.385) and S.
californiensis averaged 5.21 mg (±7.487) of plastic per ﬁsh.
Quantitatively, the average number of plastic pieces ingested
increased as the size of the ﬁsh increased, reaching a maximum
average of seven pieces per ﬁsh for the 7-cm size class ( Fig. 3 ). A
dramatic drop in average pieces per ﬁsh observed for the 8-cm size
class may be attributed to the limited sample size; only two sam-
ple ﬁsh were assigned to this class size. For the 9- and 10-cm size
classes, the average pieces per ﬁsh decreased only slightly from the
maximum average.
Qualitatively, ingested plastic consisted primarily of fragments
(94%), ﬁlm (3%), ﬁshing line (2%), and ﬁnally rope (woven

sented a wide variety of colors, with white, clear, and blue (87% to-
tal) being most prevalent. Similar percentages were observed in
the analysis of non-ingested plastics obtained from the 11 neuston
trawls. Analysis of non-ingested samples found that 89% of the
plastic fragments were white, clear and blue ( Table 2 ). The most
common size class of plastic ingested by the ﬁsh was 1–2.79 mm.
4. Discussion
Plastics, both large and small pieces, are a complex problem in
the marine environment, with poorly understood consequences
(Moore, 2008 ). Although studies have documented the effects of
large anthropogenic debris, predominantly plastic, as potentiallylethal to marine mammals through entanglement and ingestion,
the overall impact of smaller plastic debris on the marine environ-
ment will require more extensive investigation. Similarly, while
the ingestion of smaller plastic pieces by turtles, seabirds, and
some ﬁsh has been well documented, the impacts of the ingested
plastic have not been widely analyzed.
The present study examines and conﬁrms the ingestion of plas-
tic by lower trophic level ﬁsh in the NPCG. Quantiﬁcation of in-
gested plastic with respect to ﬁsh species and size class offers
important insights into the characteristics of potential impacts.
More than one-third of the ﬁsh examined had ingested small plas-
tic pieces, however, it is not possible to fully understand the effects
of ingestion until it can be determined if the ﬁsh are able to pass
this plastic through the gut, and whether some plastic remains in
the gut for the life span of the ﬁsh.
In the NPCG, the colors of the most commonly found plastics
were white, clear, and blue. These colors are similar to those of
the area’s plankton, a primary food source for surface feeding ﬁsh.
This similarity may explain a propensity for ingestion by ﬁsh. The
majority of the ﬁsh examined in the present study were part of the
family Myctophidae a mesopelagic ﬁsh commonly found in the
NPCG. These ﬁsh have diurnal feeding habits and come to the sur-
face at night to feed on small plankton ( Watanabe and Kawaguchi,
2003 ). Impacts of ingested plastic may increase as an increasing
amount of small plastic pieces mix with natural food sources in
the NPCG. Subsequently, if ﬁsh are not able to pass the ingested
plastic through their digestive tracts, the accumulation of non-
nutritive elements may lead to malnutrition and eventual starva-
tion, which could lead to signiﬁcant reductions in world ﬁsh
populations. Additionally, the buoyancy of the plastic may increase
the difﬁculty of mesopelagic ﬁsh to return to deeper waters.
The present study’s analysis of ingestion quantities based on
ﬁsh size class across species establishes a foundation for further re-
search related to long term impacts of marine debris. The larger
ﬁsh had more pieces of plastic on average in their guts than smaller
ﬁsh; however, it is unknown if the plastic had been recently con-
sumed. Consequently, without knowing the residence time of the
plastic found in ﬁsh guts, it was not possible to assess differences
in ingestion rates for ﬁsh at different stages of life. Notably, this
residence time may be an important area for future research as re-
cent studies indicate that plastic in the marine environment can
sorb extremely high levels of persistent organic pollutants ( Rios
et al., 2007; Mato et al., 2001 ), which are capable of being trans-
ferred to wildlife ( Teuten et al., 2009 ). This may pose an additional
threat to planktivorous ﬁsh and their predators at higher levels of
the food chain, such as: tunas, squid, toothed whales, seabirds, and
fur seals ( Eriksson and Burton, 2003; Phillips et al., 2001; Oizumi
et al., 2001 , and Perrin, 1975 ).
The conﬁrmation of plastic ingestion and quantiﬁcation of plas-
tics consumed by ﬁve mesopelagic and one epipelagic ﬁsh makes
an important contribution to understanding the problem of plastic
debris in the marine environment. Further study is needed to
understand the impacts of plastic debris on the general health
and life cycle of these ﬁsh, to investigate the potential for pollutant
transfer to higher trophic levels, and to explore possible actions to
protect aquatic life from plastic pollution.
