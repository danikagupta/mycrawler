Bladder cancer accounts for approximately 2% of all malignant
cancers and is the fifth and tenth most common cancer in men and
women respectively. The American Cancer Society estimated that
54 500 new cases and 11 700 deaths would have occurred in 1997.
Superficial bladder cancer (pTa, pT1 and CIS) accounts for
70–80% of cancers at first presentation. Management of superfi-
cial bladder cancer is typically by endoscopic surgical resection
often followed by a course of adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy
or immunotherapy with the aim of both eradicating remaining
tumour cells and preventing tumour recurrence (Herr, 1987). Both
antineoplastics (Mitomycin C [MMC], epirubicin and thioTEPA)
and immunotherapy (BCG) administered intravesically are effec-
tive at reducing tumour recurrence rates although it is unclear
whether disease progression to muscle invasive tumours is
prevented (Newling, 1990; Oosterlink et al, 1993). This observ-
ation in conjunction with the fact that mortality from bladder
cancer is still high underscores the need to develop more effective
therapeutic agents (Oosterlink et al, 1993). 
MMC belongs to a class of compounds known as bioreductive
drugs (Workman, 1994) and represents one of the antineoplastic
agents used to treat superficial bladder cancers (Maffezzini et al,
1996; Tolley et al, 1996). MMC is activated to a cytotoxic speciesby cellular reductases although the role of specific reductase
enzymes involved in bioreductive activation remains poorly
defined and controversial (Cummings et al, 1998a). This is particu-
larly true for the enzyme NQO1 (NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreduc-
tase, EC 1.6.99.2) which is a cytosolic flavoprotein which
catalyses the two electron reduction of various quinone based
compounds using either NADH or NADPH as electron donors
(Schlager and Powis, 1988; Siegel et al, 1990). The structurally
related compound EO9 (5-aziridinyl-3-hydroxymethyl-l-methyl-
2-[1H-indole-4,7-dione]prop- β-en-α-ol), is however a much better
substrate for NQO1 than MMC (Walton et al, 1991) and a good
correlation exists between NQO1 activity and chemosensitivity in
vitro under aerobic conditions (Robertson et al, 1994; Smitkamp-
Wilms et al, 1994; Fitzsimmons et al, 1996). Under hypoxic condi-
tions however, EO9 ’s properties are markedly different with little
or no potentiation of EO9 toxicity observed in NQO1 rich cells
(Plumb and Workman, 1994). In NQO1-deficient cell lines
however, large hypoxic cytotoxicity ratios have been reported
(Workman, 1994). EO9 therefore has the potential to exploit the
aerobic fraction of NQO1-rich tumours or the hypoxic fraction of
NQO1-deficient tumours (Workman, 1994). 
EO9 has been clinically evaluated but despite reports of three
partial remissions in phase I clinical trials, no activity was seen
against NSCLC, gastric, breast, pancreatic and colon cancers in
subsequent phase II trials (Schellens et al, 1994; Dirix et al, 1996).
These findings are particularly disappointing in view of the
preclinical studies (Hendriks et al, 1993) together with reports that
several tumour types have elevated NQO1 levels (Malkinson et al,A novel strategy for NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.99.2) mediated therapy

Summary The indolequinone EO9 demonstrated good preclinical activity but failed to show clinical efficacy against a range of tumours
following intravenous drug administration. A significant factor in EO9’s failure in the clinic has been attributed to its rapid  pharmacokinetic
elimination resulting in poor drug delivery to tumours. Intravesical administration of EO9 would circumvent the problem of drug  delivery to
tumours and the principal objective of this study is to determine whether or not bladder tumours have elevated levels of the en zyme NQO1
(NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase) which plays a key role in activating EO9 under aerobic conditions. Elevated NQO1 levels in hum an
bladder tumour tissue exist in a subset of patients as measured by both immunohistochemical and enzymatic assays. In a panel of  human
tumour cell lines, EO9 is selectively toxic towards NQO1 rich cell lines under aerobic conditions and potency can be enhanced b y reducing
extracellular pH. These studies suggest that a subset of bladder cancer patients exist whose tumours possess the appropriate bi ochemical
machinery required to activate EO9. Administration of EO9 in an acidic vehicle could be employed to reduce possible systemic to xicity as
any drug absorbed into the blood stream would become relatively inactive due to an increase in pH. © 2001 Cancer Research Campai gn

British Journal of Cancer (2001) 85(8), 1137–1146 © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign1992; Smitkamp-Wilms et al, 1995; Siegel et al, 1998). Several
possible explanations have been proposed to explain EO9 ’s lack of
clinical efficacy (Connors, 1996; Phillips et al, 1998). Recent
studies have demonstrated that the failure of EO9 in the clinic may
not be due to poor pharmacodynamic interactions but may be the
result of poor drug delivery to tumours (Phillips et al, 1998). The
rapid plasma elimination of EO9 (t1/2 < 10 min in humans) in
conjunction with poor penetration through multicell layers
suggests that EO9 will not penetrate more than a few microns from
a blood vessel within its pharmacokinetic lifespan (Schellens et al,
1994; Phillips et al, 1998). Intratumoural administration of EO9 to
NQO1-rich and -deficient tumours produced significant growth
delays (although a distinction between damage to the aerobic or
hypoxic fraction was not determined) suggesting that if EO9 can
be delivered to tumours, therapeutic effects may be achieved
(Cummings et al, 1998b). Whilst these undesirable characteristics
are a serious setback for the treatment of systemic disease, para-
doxically they may be advantageous for treating cancers which
arise in a third compartment such as superficial bladder cancer. In
this scenario, drug delivery is not problematical via the intraves-
ical route and the penetration of EO9 into avascular tissue can be
increased by maintenance of therapeutically relevant drug concen-
trations within the bladder (using a one hour instillation period for
example). NQO1 activity in tumour tissue will be the principal
determinant of selectivity of EO9 whether it is targeting the aerobic
fraction (where high levels of NQO1 are desirable) or the hypoxic
fraction of tumours (where low NQO1 and the presence of hypoxia
are essential). The principal aim of this study therefore was to
determine the activity of NQO1 in a series of human bladder
tumours and normal bladder tissue by both enzymatic and immuno-
histochemical techniques. A secondary aim of this study was to
evaluate a possible strategy for reducing possible systemic toxicity
arising from intravesical therapy based upon the fact that the
aerobic activity of EO9 against cell lines is enhanced under mild
acidic conditions (Phillips et al, 1992). Administration of EO9 in
an acidic vehicle would result in greater activity within the
bladder and any drug absorbed into the blood stream would
become relatively inactive due to the rise in extracellular pH.
Selectivity for bladder tumours would still depend on tumour
enzymology and therefore the second objective of this study was
to determine the role of NQO1 in the activation of EO9 under
acidic conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Collection of tumour and normal bladder specimens 
Ethical approval for tissue collection was obtained from the Local
Research Ethical Committee (Bradford NHS Trust) and samples
taken from patients following informed consent. A total of 17
paired cold pinch biopsies were taken from bladder tumours and
macroscopically normal-looking bladder mucosa at cystoscopy,
immediately prior to formal transurethral resection of the tumour.
Three specimens were taken from patients undergoing cystectomy
and tumour and normal samples dissected by pathologists within 1
hour of surgical removal. Specimens were flash frozen in liquid
nitrogen and transported for NQO1 enzyme analysis. Further biop-
sies were taken of the normal bladder mucosa immediately adja-
cent to the previous biopsy site and sent at the end of the
procedure, along with the resected tumour, in formalin for routine
histological analysis. In this way bladder tumour and normal bladderurothelium enzymology could be directly correlated with the appro-
priate tissue histology in each patient. Immunohistochemistry was
performed from the subsequently archived wax blocks prepared
for histology. 
Biochemical determination of NQO1 activity 
Cell cultures in exponential growth were trypsinised, washed
twice with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and sonicated
on ice (3 ×30 s bursts at 40% duty cycle and output setting 4 on
a Semat 250 cell sonicator). NQO1 activity and protein con-
centration was determined as described below. Tissues were
homogenised (10% w/v homogenate) in sucrose (0.25 M) using a
1 ml tissue homogeniser (Fisher Scientific). Cytosolic fractions
were prepared by centrifugation of the homogenate at 18 000 gfor
4 min followed by further centrifugation of the supernatant at 110
000gfor 1 h at 4 ˚C in a Beckman Optima ™TL ultracentrifuge.
Activity of NQO1 in the supernatant was determined spectropho-
tometrically (Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer) by measuring
the dicumarol sensitive reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol
(DCPIP, Sigma Aldrich, UK) at 600 nm (Traver et al, 1992). This
assay has been extensively validated for use in measuring NQO1
activity in both tissue and cell homogenates and has been shown to
be preferable to other assays for NQO1 activity (Hodnick and
Sartorelli, 1997). Each reaction contained NADH (200 µM),
DCPIP (40 µM, Sigma Aldrich, UK), Dicumarol (20 µM, when
required, Sigma Aldrich, UK), cytosolic fraction of tissues (50 µl
per assay) in a final volume of 1 ml Tris HCl buffer (50 mM, pH
7.4) containing bovine serum albumin (0.7 mg ml–1, Sigma
Aldrich, UK). Rates of DCPIP reduction were calculated from the
initial linear part of the reaction curve (30 s) and results were
expressed in terms of nmol DCPIP reduced min–1mg–1protein
using a molar extinction coefficient of 21 mM–1cm–1for DCPIP.
Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay
(Bradford, 1976). 
Immunohistochemistry 
Polyclonal antibodies (raised in rabbits) to purified rat NQO1 were a
gift from Professor Richard Knox (Enact Pharma Plc). Validation of
the antibody for use in immunohistochemistry studies was
performed by Western blot analysis using both purified human
recombinant NQO1 and cell extracts derived from a panel of cell
lines of human origin. These cell lines included H460 (human
NSCLC), RT112 (human bladder carcinoma). HT-29 (human colon
carcinoma). BE (human colon carcinoma). MT1 (human breast) and
DLD-1 (human colon carcinoma). The BE cell line has been geno-
typed for the C609T polymorphic variant of NQO1 and is a
homozygous mutant (and therefore devoid of NQO1 enzyme
activity) with respect to this polymorphism (Traver et al, 1992).
Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed
by sonication (30 s on ice) in Tris HCl (50 mM, pH 7.5) containing
2 mM EGTA, 2 mM PMSF and 25 µg ml–1leupeptin. Protein
concentration was estimated using the Bradford assay (Bradford,
1976) and a total of 12.5 µg of protein (in Lamelli sample loading
buffer) applied to a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoretic
transfer to nitrocellulose paper, membranes were blocked in
TBS/Tween 20 (0.1%) containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at
room temperature. Membranes were washed in TBS/Tween 20
(0.1%) prior to the addition of rabbit anti-rat NQO1 antibody
(1:100 dilution) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h.EO9 and bladder cancer 1139
British Journal of Cancer (2001) 85(8), 1137 –1146 © 2001 Cancer Research CampaignMembranes were extensively washed in TBS/Tween 20 (0.1%)
followed by the addition of anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase
conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution in TBS/Tween
20). Proteins were visualised by ECL-based chemiluminescence as
described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Bucks, UK). 
For immunohistochemical studies, all tissues (both tumour and
normal bladder mucosa) were fixed in 10% formalin, processed
routinely and embedded in paraffin wax. Two sections of each
tissue block were placed on one slide, one section served as the test
and the other as a negative control (no primary antibody). A total
of 5 sections from each sample were stained for NQO1 (plus nega-
tive controls) and tumour and normal samples from a total of 17
patients were analysed. Sections (5 µm) were dewaxed, rehydrated
and incubated with primary antibody (1:400 dilution) for 4 hours.
Sections were then washed and incubated with biotinylated mouse
anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min prior to immunoperoxidase staining
using VECTASTAIN ABC reagents and DAB (Vector Laborato-
ries Ltd, Peterborough, UK). Sections were counterstained with
haematoxylin according to standard procedures. 
Cell culture and chemosensitivity studies 
EO9 was a gift from NDDO Oncology, Amsterdam and MMC was
obtained from the Department of Pharmacy, St Lukes Hospital,
Bradford. H460 (human NSCLC) cell line was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HT-29 (human colon
carcinoma), RT112/83 (human bladder carcinoma epithelial),
EJ138 (human bladder carcinoma) and T24/83 (human bladder
transitional cell carcinoma) cell lines were obtained from the
European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC). A2780
(human ovarian carcinoma) and BE (human colon carcinoma)
cells were gifts from Dr T Ward (Paterson Institute, Manchester,
UK). All cell lines were maintained as monolayer cultures in
RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with fetal calf serum
(10%), sodium pyruvate (2 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM), peni-
cillin/streptomycin (50 IU ml–150µgm l–1) and buffered with
HEPES (25 mM). All cell culture materials were purchased from
Gibco BRL (Paisley, UK). Cells were exposed to MMC or EO9 at
a range of doses for 1 h and chemosensitivity was assessed
following a 5 day recovery period using the MTT assay, details of
which have been described elsewhere (Phillips et al, 1992). The
pH of the medium used during drug exposure was adjusted using
small aliquots of concentrated HCl (40 µl conc HCl (10.5 M) to 20
ml medium gives a pH of 6.0). Calibration curves were conducted
over a broad range of pH values in culture medium (pH 3.5 to 11)
and the stability of the pH conditions monitored over a 1 h incuba-
tion period at 37 ˚C. At all pH values, no significant changes in the
pH of the medium was observed over the 1 h drug exposure period
(data not presented). 
HT-29 multicell spheroids were prepared by seeding 5 ×105
cells into T25 flasks which had been based coated with agar (1%
w/v) and incubated for 24 h at 37 ˚C. Immature spheroids were
then transferred to a spinner flask (Techne) containing 250 ml of
RPMI 1640 growth medium and spheroids were kept in suspen-
sion by stirring at 50 rpm. When spheroids reached a diameter of
approximately 500 µm, they were harvested for chemosensitivity
studies. Multicell spheroids were exposed to a range of EO9
concentrations at pHe 6.0 and 7.4 for 1 h at 37 ˚C. Following drug
incubation, spheroids were washed twice in HBSS prior to disag-
gregation into single cells using trypsin EDTA. Disaggregatedspheroids were then washed in HBSS and then plated into 96 well
plates (1 ×103cells per well) and incubated at 37 ˚C for 4 days.
Chemosensitivity was assessed using the MTT assay as described
elsewhere (Phillips et al, 1992). 
The role of NQO1 in the activation of EO9 at pHe values of 7.4
and 6.0 was evaluated using the NQO1 inhibitor Flavone Acetic
Acid (FAA), details of which are described elsewhere (Phillips,
1999). FAA is a competitive inhibitor of NQO1 with respect to
NADH and at a final concentration of 2 mM, inhibition of NQO1
is >95% whereas the activity of cytochrome P450 reductase and
cytochrome b5 reductase is not substantially altered (< 5% inhibi-
tion). Briefly, H460 cells (NQO1 rich) were plated into 96 well
plates at a density of 2 ×103cells per well. Following an overnight
incubation at 37 ˚C, medium was replaced with fresh medium
(pH 7.4) containing a non-toxic concentration of FAA (2 mM) and
incubated for 1 h at 37 ˚C. Medium was then replaced with fresh
medium containing EO9 (range of drug concentrations) and FAA
(2 mM) at either pHe 7.4 or 6.0. Following a further 1 h incubation
at 37 ˚C, cells were washed twice with HBSS and incubated at
37˚C in growth medium for 5 days. Chemosensitivity was deter-
mined by the MTT assay as described above and results were
expressed in terms of IC50values, selectivity ratios (IC50at pHe
7.4/IC50at pHe 6.0) and protection ratios (IC50FAA/EO9 combin-
ations/IC50for EO9 alone). 
Substrate specificity 
The influence of acidic pHe on substrate specificity for purified
human NQO1 was determined as described previously (Walton
et al, 1991; Phillips 1996). NQO1-mediated reduction of the
quinone to the hydroquinone species is difficult to detect by
conventional assays thereby necessitating the use of a reporter
signal generating step. In this assay, the hydroquinone acts as an
intermediate electron acceptor which subsequently reduces
cytochrome c which can readily be detected spectrophotometri-
cally. Recombinant human NQO1 was derived from E. coli trans-
formed with the pKK233-2 expression plasmid containing the full
length cDNA sequence for human NQO1 (Beall et al, 1994).
Following IPTG induction, NQO1 was purified by cybacron blue
affinity chromatography, details of which are described elsewhere
(Phillips, 1996). The purified protein had a molecular weight of
approximately 31 kDa and a specific activity of 139 µmol DCPIP
reduced min–1mg–1protein (Phillips, 1996). Reduction of EO9 by
recombinant human NQO1 was determined at pH 6.0 and 7.4 by
measuring the rate of reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm on a
Beckman DU 650 spectrophotometer according to previously
published methods (Phillips, 1996). Results were expressed in
terms of µmol cytochrome c reduced min–1mg–1protein using a
molar extinction coefficient of 21.1 mM–1cm–1for cytochrome c. 
Measurement of intracellular pH 
Intracellular pH was determined using the fluorescent pH indicator
BCECF (2,7-bis-(2-carboxy-ethyl)-5-(and-6) ) carboxyfluorescein
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) according to the manufacturer ’s
instructions. Confluent flasks of cells were washed with HBSS to
remove any traces of serum containing RPMI medium and then
incubated with the esterified form of BCECF (BCECF-AM) at a
concentration of 2 µM in HBSS for 1 h at 37 ˚C. The non-denaturing
detergent Pluronic was added to the probe to aid dispersion. Cells
were then washed to remove all traces of BCECF-AM and then1140 GA Choudry et al 
British Journal of Cancer (2001) 85(8), 1137 –1146 © 2001 Cancer Research Campaigntrypsinized before being suspended in serum-free/phenol red-free
RPMI medium (Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK) at a concentration of
106cells ml–1at pH 6 for 1 h. Flourescence measurement was
determined in a Perkin –Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer in
UV grade disposable 4 ml cuvettes (Fischer Scientific) with exci-
tation wavelengths 500 nm and 450 nm (excitation bandpass slit of
10 nm) and emission wavelength fixed at 530 nm (emission band-
pass slit of 2.5 nm). These were determined to be optimal settings
for the machine and system under study. An in-situ calibration was
performed for every pHi determination with a range of 6 pHs from
4 to 9 using the ionophore nigericin at a concentration of 22.8 µM
to equilibrate pHe with pHi. Calculation of the ratio of fluores-
cence at 500 nm/450 nm was calculated after subtraction of back-
ground fluorescence from blanks at each pH (serum free, phenol
red free RPMI without cells). 
RESULTS 
Activity of NQO1 in tumour and normal bladder
specimens 
The biochemical activity of NQO1 in paired samples of tumour
(grade/stage ranging from G2 pTa to G2/G3 T4) and normal
bladder mucosa (with 3 cystectomy specimens) taken from a series
of 20 patients is presented in Table 1. Within the tumour speci-
mens, a broad range of NQO1 activity existed ranging from 571.4
nmol min–1mg–1to undetectable (<0.1 nmol min–1mg–1). In histo-
logically normal bladder mucosa specimens, NQO1 activity
ranged from 190.9 to < 0.1 nmol min–1mg–1. In the majority of
patients NQO1 activity in the tumour was greater than in the
normal bladder mucosa. Tumour grade and stage did not correlate
with NQO1 activity (Table 1). 
Validation of NQO1 antibody and immunohistochemical
localisation of NQO1 
Western blot analysis demonstrates that polyclonal anti-rat NQO1
antibody cross reacts with human NQO1 (Figure 1) with a single
band at approximately 31 kDa observed for both cell extracts and
purified human NQO1. Titration of purified NQO1 results in a
decrease in band intensity (Figure 1B) and in cell extracts, band
intensity was qualitatively consistent with NQO1 enzyme activity
(Figure 1A). In addition, the antibody does not detect NQO1 in the
BE cell line which is devoid of NQO1 activity as a result of the
C609T polymorphism (Figure 1C). No non-specific bands were
observed on Western blots. Immunoperoxidase staining of NQO1
protein in tumour tissue, bladder wall, ureter and urethra are
presented in Figure 2. Superficial and invasive tumours (pTa –
(A); G3 pT2 – (B); G3pT4 – (C) ) with high to intermediate levels
of NQO1 as determined by biochemical assays (patient numbers 1,
4 and 5 in Table 1) clearly stained positive for NQO1. Staining
was confined to the cytoplasm of tumour cells with little or no
staining of stromal cells (panels B and C). In other tumours with
intermediate or low levels of NQO1 activity, staining was hetero-
geneous with pockets of cells containing high levels of NQO1
protein (data not shown). Normal bladder wall sections were
obtained from a patient who underwent cystectomy (G3pT4
bladder tumour), ureter and urethra were obtained from another
patient who underwent cystectomy (G3 pT3a bladder tumour). In
the bladder wall, no NQO1 staining was observed in the urothe-
lium ( D) although slight staining was present in smooth musclelayers. The urethra ( E) was negative although cells on the luminal
surface of the ureter were positively stained ( F). The basal layers
of the ureter lining were however negatively stained ( F). No
evidence of invasive malignancy or in-situ carcinoma were
observed in the ureter and urethra or in the section of bladder wall
presented ( D). In 16 other normal bladder biopsy and cystectomy
specimens, no positive staining of the urothelium was observed
(data not shown). 
Influence of pH on substrate specificity and

MMC at pHe values of 7.4 and 6.0 is presented in Table 2 and
Figure 2. At pHe = 7.4, a good correlation existed between NQO1
activity and chemosensitivity to EO9 (Figure 3). In the case of
MMC (Table 2, Figure 3), a relationship between NQO1 and
chemosensitivity was apparent (at pHe 7.4) although this relation-
ship was not as prominent as shown by EO9 with a narrow range
of IC50values (range 0.9 to 7.0 µM) observed in cell lines which
cover a broad range of NQO1 activity (ranging from <1.0 to 1652nmol min–1mg–1). Both MMC and EO9 are preferentially more
toxic to cells at pHe values of 6.0 although much greater potentia-
tion of EO9 activity is seen with SR values (SR = selectivity ratio
defined as IC50pHe 7.4/IC50pHe 6.0) ranging from 3.92 to 17.21
for EO9 compared with 1.02 to 4.50 for MMC (Table 2). The
activity of EO9 was enhanced in both NQO1 rich and deficient
cell lines when pHe was reduced to 6.0 and the relationship
between NQO1 and chemosensitivity remained good when cells
were exposed to EO9 under acidic conditions (Figure 3). No cellTable 1 Tumour histology reports and NQO1 activity in paired samples of bladder tumour and normal bladder

DISCUSSION 
In terms of bioreductive drug development, two of the critical
factors which will ultimately determine selectivity are the enzy-
mology of tumours and the presence of hypoxia (Workman, 1994).
As outlined in the introduction, the presence or absence of NQO1
is central to the design of appropriate EO9-based therapeutic
strategies aimed at targeting either the aerobic (NQO1-rich cells)
or hypoxic (NQO1-deficient tumours) fraction of tumours.
Workman (1994) has outlined a proposed mechanism for the
different properties of EO9 under aerobic and hypoxic conditions
based on the hypothesis that it is the semiquinone (product of one
electron reduction) rather than the hydroquinone which is respon-
sible for toxicity. In NQO1-deficient cells, the semiquinone
produced as a result of one electron reductases would be relatively
non-toxic as it would rapidly redox cycle back to the parent
compound. Free radical species generated as a result of redox
cycling would be detoxified by superoxide dismutase or catalase
but under hypoxic conditions, the semiquinone would be relatively
stable. If this were the major toxic species, then the activity of EO9
against cells with low NQO1 would be potentiated. In NQO1-rich
cells however, the major product formed would be the hydro-
quinone. Aerobic toxicity could be generated as a result of the
back oxidation of the hydroquinone to the semiquinone species or
the parent quinone (Butler et al, 1996) resulting in free radical
generation. Under hypoxic conditions however the hydroquinone
will be more stable and if this is relatively non-toxic, then the
activity of EO9 against NQO1 cells under hypoxia would not be
potentiated. Whilst the mechanism of action of EO9 under aerobic
and hypoxic conditions is complex, the biological data suggest that
EO9 should target the aerobic fraction of NQO1-rich tumours or
the hypoxic fraction of NQO1-deficient tumours (Workman,
1994). 
Analysis of NQO1 activity in tumour and normal bladder
tissues has clearly identified patients whose tumours are either
NQO1-rich or NQO1-deficient (Table 1). Within the subset of
NQO1-rich tumours, enzyme activity is elevated relative to the
normal bladder urothelium. Immunohistochemical studies confirm
these biochemical measurements with staining confined to tumour
cells as opposed to normal stromal cells (Figure 2A, B and C).
Within normal bladder tissues, NQO1 staining was absent from
the urothelial lining of the bladder (Figure 2D) and the urethra
(Figure 2E). Faint staining of the superficial layers of the ureter
(Figure 2F) was observed although the underlying basal layers of
the ureter were negatively stained. Similarly, faint staining of the
smooth muscle layers of the bladder, ureter and urethra were also
observed (data not shown). These studies suggest that a proportion
of patients with bladder tumours (at various grades and stages of the
disease) exhibit a significant differential in terms of NQO1 activitywhich could potentially be exploited by EO9-based therapies
directed against the aerobic fraction of tumour cells. With regards
to the ability of EO9 to selectively kill hypoxic NQO1-deficient
cells, a subset of patients also exist whose tumours are devoid of
NQO1 activity (Table 1). It is not known whether or not bladder
tumours contain regions of low oxygen tension and further studies
are required using hypoxia markers such as pimonidazole
(Kennedy et al, 1997) to address this issue and to establish the
relationship between NQO1 activity and hypoxia in tumours. 
Whilst biochemical and immunohistochemical studies demon-
strate that a subset of patients exist which have the appropriate
tumour enzymology to activate EO9 (under aerobic conditions),
intravesical chemotherapy can result in systemic toxicity due to
the drug entering the blood supply. This study has also evaluated a
potential strategy for minimising any risk of systemic toxicity
based upon the hypothesis that administration of EO9 in an acidic
vehicle would enhance the potency of EO9 (Phillips et al, 1992)
within the bladder and that any drug reaching the blood stream
would become relatively inactive due to a rise in pHe. Selectivity
for aerobic cells would still be determined by NQO1 activity and
therefore it is essential to determine the role that NQO1 plays in
the activation of EO9 under acidic pHe conditions. In a panel of
cell lines with a broad spectrum of NQO1 activity, reducing the
pHe to 6.0 enhances the potency of EO9 under aerobic conditions
in all cases (with SR values ranging from 3.92 –17.21, Table 2). In
the case of MMC, potency is also enhanced at low pHe values
although the magnitude of the pH-dependent increase in toxicity is
reduced (SR values ranging from 1.02 –4.50, Table 2) compared
with EO9. With respect to MMC, one explanation for increased
activity under acidic conditions has been attributed to the fact that
MMC becomes a substrate for NQO1 under acidic conditions (Pan
et al, 1993; Siegel et al, 1993). This is not the case with EO9 as
rates of reduction of EO9 by purified human NQO1 are not influ-
enced by pH (21.10 ± 2.30 and 21.30 ± 1.50 µmol cytochrome c
reduced min–1mg–1protein at pH 7.4 and 6.0, respectively).
Recent studies have demonstrated that the activity of EO9 is
enhanced under acidic conditions (pHe = 6.5) but only when the
intracellular pH is reduced (pHi = 6.5) by co-incubation with
nigericin (Kuin et al, 1999). The results of this study are in agree-
ment with this finding as pHi becomes acidic (pHi values range
from 6.42 ± 0.05 to 6.51 ± 0.02 depending on the cell line) when
cells are cultured under pHe 6.0 conditions. 
In the panel of cell lines used in this study, a good correlation
exists between NQO1 activity and chemosensitivity at both pHe
values of 7.4 and 6.0 (Figure 3). A strong relationship between
NQO1 activity and response under aerobic conditions (at pHe 7.4)
has been established previously by several groups (Robertson et al,
1994; Smitkamp-Wilms et al, 1994; Fitzsimmons et al, 1996) and
there is clear evidence that NQO1 plays a central role in the mech-
anism of action of EO9 under aerobic conditions (Workman,
1994). The good correlation between NQO1 activity and response
at pHe 6.0, in conjunction with the fact that EO9 is still a good
substrate for NQO1 at pH 6.0, suggests that NQO1 plays a signifi-
cant role in EO9 ’s mechanism of action at acidic pHe values under
aerobic conditions. It is of interest to note however that the activity
of EO9 against BE cells (which are devoid of NQO1 activity as a
result of the C609T polymorphism; Traver et al, 1992) is also
enhanced under acidic pHe conditions (Table 2). This suggests that
there is a NQO1-independent mechanism for the increased activity
of EO9 under acidic conditions. This is confirmed by the use of the
NQO1 inhibitor FAA where the ‘protection ratios ’ (defined as theEO9 and bladder cancer 1145
British Journal of Cancer (2001) 85(8), 1137 –1146 © 2001 Cancer Research Campaignratio of IC50values for EO9 plus FAA divided by the IC50values
for EO9) are similar at both pHe 7.4 and 6.0 (13.95 and 14.63,
respectively, Table 3). If NQO1 played a central role in the activa-
tion of EO9 at pHe 6.0, then the protection ratio at pHe 6.0 would
be significantly greater than the protection ratio at pHe 7.4. The
mechanism behind the NQO1-independent activation of EO9 is
unclear although it is a well known fact that the reactivity of aziri-
dine ring structures is enhanced by protonation resulting in ring
opening to the aziridinium ion which is a potent alkylating species
(Mossoba et al, 1985; Gutierrez, 1989). Alternatively, EO9 is a
substrate for other one electron reductases (Maliepaard et al, 1995;
Saunders et al, 2000) and further studies designed to evaluate
whether EO9 ’s metabolism by these enzymes is pH dependent
needs to be determined. The potency of EO9 can be enhanced
further by reducing pHe below 6.0 (Phillips et al, 1992) but these
conditions are unlikely to provide significant clinical benefits as
EO9 becomes progressively more unstable when pH is reduced to
5.5 (t1/2 = 37 min). From a pharmacological standpoint, adminis-
tration of EO9 in a vehicle at pH 6.0 would appear desirable. Not
only would this result in significant enhancement of EO9 activity
but also the stability of EO9 would be sufficient (t1/2 = 2.5 h) to
maintain drug exposure parameters at a therapeutic level. 
With regards to the activity of EO9 against three-dimensional
culture models in vitro, this study has demonstrated that reducing
the pHe to 6.0 enhances the potency of EO9 against multicell
spheroids although the magnitude of this effect is reduced
compared with monolayer cultures (Figure 4). It is not known
whether or not reduction in pHe results in greater cell kill
throughout the spheroid or if it is confined to the surface of the
spheroid exposed to medium. In comparison with MMC, previous
studies using histocultures exposed to MMC demonstrated that no
difference in toxicity exists between physiological and acidic pHe
conditions (Yen et al, 1996). The pH-dependent increase in EO9
toxicity against spheroids suggests that manipulation of pHe may
not only be of use in treating a multilayered solid bladder tumour
but may offer an advantage over MMC. It should however be
stated that multicell spheroids are significantly less responsive to
EO9 than monolayers, presumably because of the poor penetration
properties of EO9 through avascular tissue (Phillips et al, 1998).
EO9 can nevertheless kill >90% of cells in spheroids (Figure 4)
suggesting that at higher doses at least, the penetration of EO9 is
sufficient to eradicate cells which reside some distance away from
the surface of the spheroid. 
In conclusion, the results of this study have demonstrated that
within a population of patients with bladder tumours at various
stages and grades of the disease, there exists a great heterogeneity
regarding the expression of NQO1. The majority of patients have
tumours possessing elevated levels of NQO1 while a small subset
of patients appear to be devoid of NQO1 activity. The heteroge-
neous nature of NQO1 activity described here is consistent with
several other studies in various tumour types (Malkinson et al,
1992; Smitkamp-Wilms et al, 1995; Siegel et al, 1998). These
findings reinforce the view that ‘enzyme profiling ’ of individual
patients could be valuable prior to therapeutic intervention with
bioreductive drugs (Workman, 1994). This is to our knowledge the
first study to characterise NQO1 activity and cellular localisation
in bladder tumours and provide strong evidence to support the
evaluation of EO9 against superficial and locally invasive bladder
tumours. This study has clearly demonstrated that under aerobic
conditions, EO9 is much more potent under acid conditions (pH
6.0) than at physiological pH (pH 7.4). The mechanism for thisincreased EO9 potency appears to be NQO1 independent and
whilst this will not improve (or reduce) selectivity, it may prove
beneficial in terms of reducing the therapeutically effective dose
of EO9. Dose reduction in conjunction with the fact that a reduc-
tion in the potency of EO9 due to the increased pHe in the blood
stream suggests that systemic toxicity arising from the intravesical
administration of EO9 would be low. In addition, this study shows
that under physiological conditions the activity of EO9 is much
lower in tissues with ‘normal ’ expression of NQO1 compared to
‘high’ NQO1-expressing tissues (i.e. the tumours). The results of
this study provide strong evidence in support of the proposal that
intravesical administration of EO9 may have activity against
bladder tumours.
