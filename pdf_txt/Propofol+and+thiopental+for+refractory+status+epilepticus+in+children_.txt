Purpose:  To  summarize  the  available  evidence  related  to  pediatric  refractory  status  epilepticus  (RSE)  and
super-refractory  status  epilepticus  (SRSE),  with  emphasis  on  epidemiology,  etiologies,  therapeutic
approaches,  and  clinical  outcomes.
Methods:  Narrative  review  of  the  medical  literature  using  MEDLINE  database.
Results:  RSE  is  deﬁned  as  status  epilepticus  (SE)  that  fails  to  respond  to  adequately  used  ﬁrst-  and  second-
line  antiepileptic  drugs.  SRSE  occurs  when  SE  persist  for  24  h  or  more  after  administration  of  anesthesia,
or  recurs  after  its  withdrawal.  RSE  and  SRSE  represent  complex  neurological  emergencies  associated  with
long-term  neurological  dysfunction  and  high  mortality.  Challenges  in  management  arise  as  the
underlying  etiology  is  not  always  promptly  recognized  and  therapeutic  options  become  limited  with
prolonged  seizures.  Treatment  decisions  mainly  rely  on  case  series  or  experts ’  opinions.  The  comparative
effectiveness  of  different  treatment  strategies  has  not  been  evaluated  in  large  prospective  series  or
randomized  clinical  trials.  Continuous  infusion  of  anesthetic  agents  is  the  most  common  treatment  for
RSE  and  SRSE,  although  many  questions  on  optimal  dosing  and  rate  of  administration  remain
unanswered.  The  use  of  non-pharmacological  therapies  is  documented  in  case  series  or  reports  with  low
level  of  evidence.  In  addition  to  neurological  complications  resulting  from  prolonged  seizures,  children
with  RSE/SRSE  often  develop  systemic  complications  associated  with  polypharmacy  and  prolonged
hospital  stay.
Conclusion:  RSE  and  SRSE  are  neurological  emergencies  with  limited  therapeutic  options.  Multi-national
collaborative  efforts  are  desirable  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efﬁcacy  of  current  RSE/SRSE  therapies,  and
potentially  impact  patients ’  outcomes.

1.  Introduction
Refractory  status  epilepticus  (RSE)  is  a  life-threatening  neuro-
logical  emergency  associated  with  signiﬁcant  morbidity  and
mortality.  RSE  is  deﬁned  as  seizure  activity  that  persists  after
administration  of  a  ﬁrst-line  benzodiazepine  (BZD)  and  a  second-
line  antiseizure  drug  (ASD)  [1].  Primarily  encountered  and  treatedin  the  intensive  care  unit  (ICU),  RSE  patients  usually  receive
additional  boluses  of  second-line  ASDs  (e.g.  fosphenytoin,  levetir-
acetam,  and  valproate)  or  are  placed  in  a  medically  induced  coma
with  intravenous  (IV)  continuous  infusions  (CI)  of  an  anesthetic
(e.g.  midazolam,  propofol,  barbiturates)  for  seizure  control.
Nevertheless,  continuous  or  intermittent  seizures  may  persist
for  24  h  or  more  following  the  administration  of  general  anesthesia
or  recur  after  its  withdrawal.  The  resulting  condition  is  known  as
super-refractory  status  epilepticus  (SRSE)  [2].  Identifying  the
underlying  etiology  of  RSE  and  SRSE  can  be  challenging.  Treatment
decisions  mainly  rely  on  case  series  or  experts ’  opinions.  The
comparative  effectiveness  of  heterogeneous  treatment  strategies
has  not  been  systematically  evaluated  in  large  prospective  series  or
randomized  clinical  trials.
The  annual  incidence  of  status  epilepticus  (SE)  is  estimated  to
be  17–23  episodes  per  100,000  children  [3,4] .  Of  these  SE  patients,
between  10%  and  40%  develop  RSE  [5–7]  with  a  mortality  rate  of
16–43.5%  [8–10].  The  few  epidemiological  studies  on  SRSE  are
based  mainly  in  adult  population  [11]  indicating  that  10–15%  ofAbbreviations:  ASD,  Anti-seizure  drug;  BZD,  Benzodiazepine;  CEEG,  Continuous

RSE  cases  progress  to  SRSE  [12,13] ,  and  approximately  one-third  of
RSE  and  SRSE  patients  die  [12–14].  In  children,  a  retrospective
study  showed  that  of  602  convulsive  SE  episodes,  SRSE  occurred  in
7.14%  [15].  In  the  United  States,  most  data  come  from  case  series  or
case  reports.  Without  large  series,  estimating  the  exact  incidence
and  mortality  of  SRSE  is  challenging.  In  this  review  we  present
existing  evidence  on  pediatric  RSE/SRSE  including  clinical  pre-
sentations  and  etiologies.  We  address  current  diagnostic  and
treatment  approaches,  as  well  as  clinical  outcomes  of  RSE/SRSE  in
children.
1.1.  Clinical  presentation
Patients  who  develop  RSE/SRSE  present  clinically  in  different
ways.  The  most  common  presentation  is  generalized  convulsive  SE
(GCSE),  the  major  seizure  type  for  pediatric  SE  [16–18],  or  focal  SE
with  impaired  consciousness  after  failure  to  initial  treatment.
Other  common  clinical  presentations  are  subtler  and  thus,  are
suggestive  of  non-convulsive  SE  (NCSE).  In  the  latter  clinical
scenario,  patients  usually  present  with  stupor/coma  after  a  GCSE  or
after  an  acute  brain  insult  [19,20] .  Although  convulsive  SE  often
evolves  to  NCSE,  the  distinction  between  these  two  phenotypes  is
crucial  as  the  therapeutic  approaches  and  outcomes  are  different,
being  NCSE  more  often  associated  with  medical  refractoriness  due
to  delayed  recognition  [20].
1.2.  Etiology
The  etiologies  for  pediatric  RSE  and  SRSE  reported  in  the
literature  vary.  The  most  commonly  reported  etiologies  include:
acute  symptomatic  causes  (e.g.  presumed  infectious  or  immune
mediated  encephalitis,  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  infections,
traumatic  brain  injury  (TBI),  brain  ischemia),  remote  symptom-
atic  with  acute  precipitant  causes  (e.g.  CNS  lymphoproliferative
disease,  human  immunode ﬁciency  virus  (HIV)  infection,  hyp-
oxic-ischemic  encephalopathy,  developmental  delay,  epilepsy),
remote  symptomatic  and  progressive  encephalopathies  (e.g.
Alpers  disease,  metabolic  diseases  such  as  medium  chain  acyl-
CoA  dehydrogenase  deﬁciency,  epileptic  encephalopathies),
febrile  SE  (excluding  CNS  infections),  and  unknown  etiologies
(e.g.  cryptogenic)  [3,8,21,22] .  Nonetheless,  previous  studies
show  that  etiology  varies  according  to  age  groups  and
geographic  location.  In  a  study  of  151  refractory  convulsive  SE
(RCSE)  episodes,  the  most  common  etiology  was  acute
symptomatic  (28.5%)  in  neonates  and  infants;  prolonged  febrile
convulsions  (33.8%)  in  children  1–5  years;  and  remote  symp-
tomatic  etiologies  in  40%  of  patients  between  5  and  10  years  old,
and  in  36.8%  patients  between  10  and  16  years  old  [23].  In
contrast,  the  etiologies  contributing  to  RSE  and  SRSE  develop-
ment  in  the  adult  population  include  acute  brain  injury  (e.g.
cerebrovascular  disease,  CNS  infections,  brain  tumor,  traumatic
brain  injury),  intoxication/withdrawal  syndromes,  low  levels  of
antiepileptic  drugs,  metabolic  distrubances,  and  systemic
infections  [19].  In  developing  countries,  acute  symptomatic
etiology  remains  the  most  frequent  etiology  in  children,
followed  by  remote  symptomatic  and  unknown  etiologies.
Within  the  acute  symptomatic  etiology,  CNS  infections  (e.g.
herpes  simplex  virus  (HSV),  HIV,  neurocysticercosis,  malaria,
tuberculosis),  viral/autoimmune  encephalitis  and  meningitis
are  common  causes  [7,24 –30].
New  Onset  RSE  (NORSE),  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  clinical
presentation  described  in  patients  without  epilepsy  or  a  relevant
preexisting  neurological  disorder,  who  present  with  RSE  without
an  identi ﬁable  acute  cause  or  active  structural,  toxic  or  metabolic
cause  [31].  A  subcategory  of  NORSE  known  as  febrile  infection-
related  epilepsy  syndrome  (FIRES)  commonly  presents  inpreviously  healthy  school-aged  children  [32,33] .  These  patients
usually  have  a  preceding  febrile  illness,  with  fever  starting
between  2  weeks  and  24  h  prior  to  the  onset  of  SE,  and  can
present  with  or  without  fever  at  the  onset  of  SE  [31].  The  etiology  of
this  syndrome  remains  unknown,  and  the  seizures  in  this  patient
population  are  notoriously  difﬁcult  to  control  in  both  the  acute  and
chronic  settings.  While  NORSE  and  FIRES  are  relatively  rare
epilepsy  syndromes,  they  are  frequent  in  the  SRSE  population.  In  a
small  study  of  ketogenic  diet  (KD)  usage  for  SRSE,  the  most
common  etiologies  included  encephalitis/FIRES  (55.55%),  followed
by  FIRES  (22.22%),  epileptic  encephalopathy  (11.11%),  and  central
nervous  system-hemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  (11.11%)
[34].  Another  study  showed  that  40%  patients  with  SRSE  had  a
diagnosis  of  immune-mediated  encephalitis  (Rasmussen ’s  syn-
drome,  post-infectious  mycoplasma  encephalitis  and  Anti-N-
methyl- D-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptor  encephalitis),  followed  by
FIRES  (20%),  genetic  epilepsies  (PCDH19  and  GABRG2  mutations)
(20%),  epilepsy  of  a  known  metabolic  etiology  (10%)  and  NORSE
(10%)  [35].  Therefore,  when  initial  diagnostic  workup  reveals
negative  results,  these  epilepsy  syndromes  should  be  considered  in
the  differential  diagnosis.
1.3.  Pathophysiology
In  RSE  and  particularly  SRSE,  mechanisms  responsible  for
seizure  termination  fail  and  additional  pathophysiologic  processes
develop  leading  to  persistence  of  SE.  At  a  cellular  level,  SE
intensi ﬁes  the  internalization  of  synaptic  g-amino  butyric  acid
type  A  (GABA-A)  receptors  whereas  the  function  of  extra  synaptic
receptors  is  preserved.  This  synaptic  “receptor  trafﬁcking ”  leads  to
an  overall  reduction  of  the  inhibitory  activity  of  GABA,  playing  a
key  role  in  the  development  of  pharmacoresistance  [36].
Additionally,  increased  number  of  glutaminergic  receptors  at  the
neuronal  surface  may  contribute  to  seizure  perpetuation  due  to
changes  in  concentrations  of  ions,  like  chloride,  in  the  cellular
environment.  Furthermore,  the  persistence  of  seizures  and
development  of  SRSE  may  be  explained  by  sensitivity  to  NMDA-
mediated  neuronal  stimulation  [37],  mitochondrial  failure  [38],
blood-brain  barrier  damage,  and  neuro  inﬂammation  (i.e.  pro-
inﬂammatory  cytokines,  autoantibodies  to  neural  elements)  [2].
All  of  these  factors  result  in  excitotoxicity  [39],  which  is  directly
responsible  for  neuronal  injury  and  cell  loss,  and  ultimately  poor
clinical  outcomes.  Finally,  previous  studies  demonstrate  the
important  role  of  time  from  seizure  onset  to  treatment  adminis-
tration  on  seizure  duration  [40,41] .  If  treatment  is  delayed  or
inadequate,  seizures  can  rapidly  become  self-sustained  and  fail  to
respond  to  the  intrinsic  mechanisms  normally  involved  in  seizure
termination  [42].
2.  Diagnosis  &  treatment
2.1.  Diagnostic  approach
Approximately  15%  of  patients  with  a  prolonged  convulsive
seizure  episode  (>5  min)  may  achieve  seizure  cessation  without
medical  intervention  [6];  however,  the  majority  of  patients
experience  a  seizure  lasting  more  than  30  min.  Therefore,  RSE
recognition  is  crucial  and  requires  prompt  diagnostic  evaluation
and  treatment  in  order  to  prevent  long-term  sequelae.  At  this  point
in  time,  SE  patients  may  have  already  completed  a  battery  of
testing  [43–45],  yet  efforts  should  remain  focused  on  identifying
the  etiology  of  RSE/SRSE  (Table  1)  [22,43 –45].  Laboratory
investigations  for  inﬂammatory  and  immune-related  etiologies
(e.g.  serum  and  CSF-autoantibodies,  IgG  index)  should  be  tiered
according  to  the  disease  phenotype  [45,46] .  With  more  readily
available  genetic  testing,  evaluations  for  genetic  epilepsyA.  Vasquez  et  al.  /  Seizure  68  (2019)  62–71  63syndromes  should  be  considered  in  patients  in  whom  an  etiology  is
not  established  with  the  initial  testing.  These  should  be  suspected
particularly  in  patients  that  present  at  young  ages,  or  with  a  history
of  dysmorphic  features,  developmental  delay  or  a  family  history  of
epilepsy.
Lastly,  continuous  electroencephalography  (cEEG)  monitoring
is  essential  for  the  diagnosis  and  management  of  RSE/SRSE
[43,47,48] .  Monitoring  with  cEEG  allows  clinicians  to  target
electrographic  seizure  cessation  or  achievement  of  burst-suppres-
sion  as  the  case  requires  [43,47,48] .  It  is  helpful  to  guide  the
induction  of  pharmacological  coma  as  well  as  the  identi ﬁcation  of
subsequent  electrographic  seizures,  often  recurring  during  titra-
tion  or  weaning  of  anesthetic  agents  [49].  Furthermore,  there  is
evidence  that  approximately  1/3  of  the  children  with  convulsive  SE
may  develop  electrographic  seizures  and  of  these,  almost  half
evolve  to  electrographic  SE  [50].  There  is  certainly  an  increased
awareness  of  the  valuable  aid  of  cEEG  in  the  initial  treatment  and
diagnosis  of  RSE/SRSE  [51,52] ;  however,  not  all  of  the  available
pediatric  studies  include  it  in  their  RSE/SRSE  management.  This
highly  limits  the  generalizability  of  results  and  comparison  of
clinical  outcomes  across  studies,  particularly  in  NCSE.
2.2.  Treatment
The  therapeutic  approach  in  RSE/SRSE  aims  to  achieve  seizure
control  with  prevention  of  excitotoxicity,  neuroprotection  and
avoidance  of  systemic  complications  [53].  Coma  induction  withanesthetic  agents  is  the  most  common  treatment  after  failure  of
ﬁrst-  and  second-line  ASDs.  The  choice  of  anesthetic  agent  is  often
individualized.  Unfortunately,  due  to  the  lack  of  randomized
clinical  trials  to  guide  clinical  practice,  the  goal  of  pharmacological
induced  coma  (termination  of  seizures,  burst-suppression  or
complete  suppression  of  EEG  activity  [54]),  duration,  and  weaning
parameters  remain  unclear.  In  general,  CIs  should  be  titrated  to
achieve  electrographic  seizure  cessation  or  burst-suppression;
which  should  be  maintained  for  at  least  24–48h  before  withdrawal
of  CI  agents  [43].  If  seizures  recur  after  the  weaning  period,  CIs  are
usually  up-titrated  until  cessation  is  re-attained  and  for  additional
24–48h.  In  addition  to  coma  induction  with  anesthetic  agents,  the
use  of  adjunctive  therapies  such  as  immunomodulation,  ketogenic
diet,  hypothermia,  electroconvulsive  therapy  and  vagus  nerve
stimulation  might  be  considered  despite  their  low  level  of
evidence.  The  treatment  approaches  for  RSE/SRSE  are  heteroge-
neous  and  usually  employed  in  a  trial  and  error  fashion  until  a
response  is  achieved.  Table  2  summarizes  the  most  common
pharmacological  and  non-pharmacological  therapies  for  the
treatment  of  RSE/SRSE  [43,55,56]  and  their  corresponding  level
of  evidence.
2.2.1.  Anesthetics  and  continuous  infusions
The  most  commonly  used  agents  for  coma  induction  are
midazolam  [15,26,57 –59],  barbiturates  and  propofol  [53,60] .
Midazolam  is  a  fast-acting  BZD  that  enhances  the  action  of  GABA
on  the  GABA-A  receptors  in  the  CNS  [61,62] .  It  has  a  short  durationTable  1

0.2  mg/kg  followed  by  an  infusion  rate  of  0.05 –2  mg/kg/h.  It  is  used
to  achieve  electrographic/clinical  seizure  cessation  or  burst-
suppression  [43,55] .  A  randomized,  open  label  study  showed  that
the  efﬁcacy  of  continuous  midazolam  in  controlling  RSE  was
similar  to  infusion  of  diazepam  (86%  vs  89%  with  diazepam).
Midazolam  however,  was  associated  with  a  higher  recurrence  rate
(57%  vs.  16%  with  diazepam)  [43,63] .  Similarly,  a  study  of  27
children  with  refractory  generalized  convulsive  SE,  demonstrated
that  midazolam  infusion  (0.2  mg/kg  as  bolus  followed  by  5  mcg/kg/
min  as  CI)  was  effective  in  the  control  of  RSE  in  26  (96%)  children
within  65  min,  with  no  adverse  events  [28].  Even  though  the  use  of
CI  midazolam  may  cause  cardiorespiratory  depression  and
hypotension;  the  risk  is  still  low  compared  to  other  anesthetics
[64].  Another  important  aspect  to  consider  is  the  risk  of
tachyphylaxis,  which  may  occur  after  prolonged  midazolam  use.
Thus,  requiring  constant  monitoring  and  adjustment  of  the
dosing  [43].
If  midazolam  fails  to  control  SE,  clinicians  typically  resort  to
using  barbiturates  as  a  second  agent.  Pentobarbital  and  thiopental
are  both  barbiturates  that  act  similar  to  midazolam,  through  the
enhancement  of  GABA  activity.  Additionally,  they  inhibit  gluta-
mate  NMDA  receptors  and  alter  the  ion  conductance  in  the  axonal
membrane.  Pentobarbital  is  administered  with  an  initial  bolus  of
5–15  mg/kg  (may  give  additional  5–10  mg/kg)  followed  by  an
infusion  rate  of  0.5–5  mg/kg/h.  to  achieve  electrographic/clinical
seizure  cessation  or  burst-suppression.  A  case  series  of  26  children
treated  with  pentobarbital  showed  that  75%  of  patients  achieved
burst-suppression  pattern  on  EEG,  with  a  relapse  rate  of  22%  upon
its  weaning  [10].  Another  study  of  30  patients  presenting  RSE
showed  that  33%  achieved  burst-suppression  with  pentobarbital
without  relapse;  while  66.7%  required  titration  of  pentobarbital  to
reachieve  burst-suppression.  The  authors  also  found  that  patients
older  than  ﬁve  years  and  those  who  achieved  burst-suppression
within  one  day  of  pentobarbital  initiation  were  more  likely  to  havepositive  outcomes  [65].  Thiopental  is  less  commonly  used,  but  can
be  administered  with  an  initial  bolus  of  2–7  mg/kg  followed  by  an
infusion  rate  of  0.5–5  mg/kg/h.  [43].  Its  efﬁcacy  in  terminating
seizures  showed  to  be  lower  (55%;  11/20  patients)  than  propofol
(64%;  14/22  patients)  in  a  retrospective  study  [66].  A  major
drawback  of  barbiturates  is  the  long  half-life,  which  leads  to  a
delayed  recovery  time.  In  addition,  barbiturates  are  associated
with  a  high  rate  of  side  effects  including  hypotension,  respiratory
depression,  infections,  anemia  and  prolonged  length  of  ICU  stay
[64,67] .  Reported  effectiveness  in  SE  termination  with  barbiturates
varies  between  64%  and  69%  with  an  estimated  seizure  recurrence
rate  of  22%  [10,64,65,67] .  Because  the  majority  of  patients  initiated
on  pentobarbital  infusions  have  failed  to  stop  ongoing  seizure
activity  with  midazolam,  showing  the  potential  for  a  more  severe
form  of  SRSE,  the  higher  seizure  recurrence  rate  associated  with
pentobarbital  infusions  should  be  interpreted  cautiously.
The  use  of  propofol  is  reported  in  the  treatment  of  adult  RSE
[68].  Although  the  mechanism  of  action  is  similar  to  midazolam
and  barbiturates  (GABA-A  receptor  agonist),  its  use  in  children  is
limited.  A  previous  report  showed  that  children  have  increased  risk
of  propofol  infusion  syndrome  (PRIS),  a  life-threatening  condition
characterized  by  metabolic  acidosis,  rhabdomyolysis,  arrhythmias,
myocardial  and  renal  failure,  that  results  from  administering  a
dose  higher  than  4  mg/kg/h.  during  48  or  more  hours  [69].  Thus,
propofol  should  be  used  with  caution  in  pediatric  patients,
particularly  with  doses  greater  than  65  mcg/kg/min.
Ketamineisan  alternative  therapy  forcontrol  of  RSE[70].  Itacts  as
a  noncompetitive  antagonist  of  NMDA  receptor  and  has  been
postulated  to  reduce  epileptiform  burst  discharges  and  prevent
glutamate-mediated  neuro-toxicity  [71,72] .  Since,  in  late  stages  of
SE,  there  is  a  decrease  in  the  number  of  active  GABA-A  receptors  and
up-regulated  glutamate  NMDA  receptors,  ketamine  emerged  as  a
promising  treatment.  A  retrospective  multicenter  study  including  46
adults  and  12  children  reported  that  permanent  SE  control  was  likely
attributed  to  ketamine  in  32%  (19/60)  of  patients,  and  transientTable  2  (Continued )

administered  as  third-  or  fourth-line  treatment,  SE  control  was
achieved  in  60%  (6/10)  of  patients  [73].  Similarly,  a  systematic  review
of  162  adults  and  52  children,  showed  that  ketamine  was  effective  in
56.5%  and  36.5%,  of  the  adults  and  children,  respectively.  From  the
pediatric  studies  included  in  the  review,  those  who  reported
ketamine  dosing  indicated  either  an  initial  bolus  followed  by  CI,
isolated  CI  or  oral  administration.  The  initial  bolus  dosing  ranged
between  2  and  3  mg/kg,  followed  by  an  infusion  rate  of  7.5  mcg/kg/h.
to  10  mg/kg/h.  When  ketamine  was  administered  as  isolated  CI,  the
dose  ranged  between  7  and  60  mcg/kg/min  [74].  Despite  the
sympathomimetic  properties,  ketamine  has  a  relative  safe  proﬁle
[74].  Compared  to  other  anesthetics,  it  has  the  advantage  of  avoiding
endotracheal  intubation  due  to  lack  of  respiratory  compromise  [75].
There  is  a  current  ongoing  multicenter,  randomized,  controlled  trial
[76]  evaluating  the  efﬁcacy  of  ketamine  in  pediatric  RSE.  We
anticipate  that  the  results  will  be  essential  to  stratify  anesthetic
utilization  for  the  treatment  of  RSE/SRSE.  They  could  help  to
overcome  current  limitations  of  retrospective  data  particularly,
heterogeneity  of  medications  prior  to  ketamine  use,  dosing  and
timing  of  administration.
One  of  the  last  resorts  of  the  SE/RSE  treatment  protocols  is
inhalational  anesthesia.  The  antiepileptic  effects  of  inhaled
anesthetics  likely  involve  potentiation  of  GABA-A  receptors  and
inhibition  of  glutamate  NMDA  receptors  [77,78] .  Isoﬂurane  and
desﬂurane  are  commonly  used  for  the  treatment  of  RSE  and  have
shown  to  be  effective  in  inducing  burst-suppression  that  is  easily
titratable  [79,80] .  In  the  children,  the  most  common  inhalational
anesthetic  used  is  isoﬂurane  [81–86].  It  is  administered  with  end-
tidal  concentrations  of  0.5–2.3%  [82,83]  through  an  anesthetic
machine.  This  poses  a  potential  logistical  limitation  in  the  ICU
[81,82] .  A  clinical  series  of  11  RSE  episodes  in  9  patients  (4  adults,  5
children)  demonstrated  achievement  of  seizure  cessation  (EEG
burst-suppression  pattern)  with  isoﬂurane  in  all  patients.  None-
theless,  8/11  (72.7%)  episodes  relapsed  upon  discontinuation  of
isoﬂurane  and  6/9  (66.7%)  patients  died  [83].  Another  series  of  5
adults  and  2  children  presenting  RSE,  showed  that  isoﬂurane  and
desﬂurane  stopped  seizures  in  100%  of  cases,  with  sustained  EEG
burst-suppression  pattern  [87].  Overall,  the  efﬁcacy  of  inhalational
anesthetics  seems  to  be  transient  and  thus,  should  be  considered  as
a  temporary  measure  while  additional  workup  is  done  to  establish
the  etiology  and/or  adjunctive  therapy  is  administered.  The  most
commonly  reported  side  effect  of  inhalational  anesthetics  is
hypotension,  requiring  use  of  vasopressors.  Other  common  side
effects  include  atelectasis,  deep  vein  thrombosis,  infections  and
paralytic  ileus  [2],  all  of  which  are  limiting  factors  for  their  use.
2.2.2.  Immune  modulators
In  cases  of  RSE  of  a  presumed  autoimmune/in ﬂammatory
etiology  or  in  cryptogenic  NORSE,  clinicians  frequently  use
immunomodulatory  therapies  as  trial  in  attempts  to  control
seizures.  In  this  scenario,  their  use  is  supported  by  recent  discoveries
on  immunologic  (antibodies  against  neural  receptors  such  as
voltage-gated  potassium  channels  and  NMDA  receptors)  and
inﬂammatory  (activation  of  inﬂammatory  signaling  pathways  such
as  Interleukin-1  receptor/toll-like  receptor  pathway)  processes  that
may  contribute  to  their  underlying  pathophysiology  [53,88,89] .  The
most  commonly  used  therapies  include  corticosteroids,  IV  immu-
noglobulin  (IVIG)  and  plasmapheresis  [33,90 –94];  however,  their
efﬁcacy  remains  controversial.  A  series  of  5  young  adults  with  new
onset  SRSE,  showed  that  early  administration  of  immunotherapy
(steroids,  IVIG,  and/or  azathioprine)  achieved  seizure  control  in  3
patients  with  subsequent  AEDs,  and  was  associated  with  good
outcomes  [95].  Nonetheless,  a  review  including  21  RSE/SRSE  cases
treated  with  adjunctive  immunomodulatory  therapy  showed
adequate  seizure  control  in  only  5%  of  cases  [68].Plasmapheresis  is  often  used  in  parallel  to  other  immuno-
therapies,  particularly  in  RSE/SRSE  etiologies  such  as  FIRES,  anti-
NMDA  encephalitis,  and  autoimmune  paraneoplastic  encephalitis.
A  previous  series  showed  the  potential  beneﬁt  of  early  adminis-
tration  of  plasmapheresis  in  FIRES.  In  this  series,  4  patients
received  plasmapheresis  at  days  11,  12,  20  and  30,  respectively,
after  seizure  onset.  The  two  patients  that  received  plasmapheresis
at  days  11  and  12  presented  better  clinical  outcomes  than  those
who  received  it  later  [96].  On  the  contrary,  a  retrospective  case
series  showed  that  plasmapheresis  was  no  efﬁcacious  in  two
patients  with  FIRES  [94].
There  are  less  conventional  immune  therapies  that  target  pro-
inﬂammatory  cytokines,  which  are  considered  to  play  an  impor-
tant  role  in  the  etiopathology  of  resistant  epilepsies  [97].  Recently,
the  use  of  Anakinra  has  gained  attention  for  the  treatment  of  FIRES
[98].  Anakinra  is  an  antagonist  of  the  interleukin  (IL)  1  receptor
type  1,  which  inhibits  the  biological  actions  of  IL-1β  [99].  IL-1β  is  a
pro-in ﬂammatory  cytokine  with  ictogenic  properties.  In  animal
models  with  refractory  seizures,  microglia  and  astrocytes  exhibit
overexpression  of  IL-1β  [100] ,  which  makes  of  Anakinra  a  potential
therapeutic  approach  for  new  onset  RSE/SRSE.
Similarly,  the  potential  involvement  of  toll-like  receptors  and  IL
receptors  in  the  role  of  innate  immunity  as  a  precipitating  factor  of
seizures  makes  inﬂammatory  mediators  appealing  therapeutic
targets.  Drugs  such  as  Pralnacasan  (inhibitor  of  IL-1β  converting
enzyme),  Belnacasan  (selective  inhibitor  of  the  interleukin
converting  enzyme/caspase-1  family),  VX765  (selective  inhibitor
of  interleukin  converting  enzyme),  Resveratrol  (suppressor  of
nuclear  factor  kB  induced  by  toll  like  receptors)  and  Ifenprodil
(sensitive  blocker  of  NR2B-contaning  NMDA  receptors)  are
experimental  inﬂammatory  modulating  therapies  that  deserve
further  exploration  for  the  treatment  of  RSE/SRSE  [97].
2.2.3.  Other  therapies
Ketogenic  diet  (KD)  is  a  high-fat,  low-carbohydrate,  and
adequate-protein  diet  considered  a  safe  and  effective  optional
therapy  for  patients  with  drug-resistant  epilepsy  [101] .  It  has  gained
signiﬁcant  attentionin  recentyears  for  the  treatmentofSE  [102 –104]
as  an  adjunctive  therapy  due  to  its  anti-in ﬂammatory  and  anti-
seizure  properties.  In  the  pediatric  population,  small  series  report  a
collective  efﬁcacy  rate  of  approximately  54%  [34,35,105 –107].  In  a
seriesof9  childrenwithFIRES,KDwasadministeredwitharatiooffat
to  combined  protein  and  carbohydrate  of  4:1  between  days  4  and  55
of  seizure  onset.  Seizure  cessation  was  achieved  in  7  of  8  (87.5%)
patients  that  reached  ketosis,  within  2–4  days  of  ketonuria.  Sixof  the
7  patients  were  maintained  on  the  diet  and  re-experienced  mild
seizures  (/C242  seizures  per  week)  only  after  few  months.  The
remaining  patient  returned  to  RSE  after  termination  of  KD,  dying
10  days  later  [108] .  Overall,  there  is  heterogeneity  regarding  timing
of  implementation  of  KD,  time  to  ketosis  and  clinical  outcomes
[34,35,101,107 –115].  Moreover,  the  simultaneous  use  of  pharmaco-
logic  and  non-pharmacologic  therapies  challenges  the  full  under-
standing  of  the  impact  of  KD  efﬁcacy  in  RSE/SRSE  as  well  as  the
optimal  parametersof  administration.  An  important  considerationis
the  involvement  of  a  dietitian  in  the  multidisciplinary  team,  as  they
will  be  crucial  for  achieving  and  maintaining  ketosis  in  these
patients.  In  children  who  are  unable  to  take  enteral  feeds,
implementation  of  KD  can  become  complicated.  Thus,  IV  KD  can
be  used  in  these  patients  as  a  temporary  measure  [34,105] .
Contraindications  to  KD  implementation  include  carnitine  deﬁcien-
cies,  beta-oxidation  metabolic  defects,  pyruvate  carboxylase  deﬁ-
ciency  and  porphyria  [116] .  In  the  absence  of  a  contraindication,  KD
could  be  considered  in  earlier  stages  of  RSE  and  SRSE  management.
The  use  of  neurosteroids  (e.g.  allopregnanolone)  in  RSE/SRSE
was  initially  supported  by  their  action  on  extrasynaptic  GABA-A
receptors.  These  are  different  to  BZDs ’  receptors  as  they  do  notA.  Vasquez  et  al.  /  Seizure  68  (2019)  62–71  67undergo  internalization  with  prolonged  seizures  [117] ,  and  thus,
represented  a  promising  therapy  for  RSE/SRSE.  Their  use  was
reported  in  adults  [118]  and  two  pediatric  patients  [119] ,  in  whom
the  neurosteroids  allowed  the  general  anesthetic  infusions  to  be
successfully  weaned.  Nonetheless,  a  recent  randomized  controlled
trial  in  adults  and  children  failed  to  demonstrate  the  efﬁcacy  of  IV
allopregnanolone  (brexanolone)  compared  to  placebo  (43.9%  vs.
42.4%;  p  =  0.877)  in  the  resolution  of  SRSE,  when  it  was  added  to
the  standard  care  [120] .  These  results  highlight  the  importance  of
data  derived  from  randomized  clinical  trials  to  inform  and  guide
current  clinical  RSE/SRSE  management.
Therapeutic  hypothermia  is  described  mainly  for  the  treat-
ment  of  TBI.  Currently,  it  is  considered  as  an  adjunctive  therapy
for  RSE/SRSE  due  to  its  neuroprotective  and  antiepileptic
properties  demonstrated  in  animal  studies.  Moreover,  it  has
the  capacity  to  reduce  cerebral  metabolic  rate,  cerebral  edema,
inﬂammation,  oxidative  stress,  and  glutaminergic  drive  [121,122] .
In  children,  multiple  case  reports  describe  resolution  of  RSE  with
adjunctive  hypothermia  [123 –126] .  In  a  series  of  5  children  with
RSE,  mild  hypothermia  (32 –35/C14C)  was  beneﬁcial  in  reducing
seizure  burden,  and  prevented  RSE  relapse  in  all  the  patients
[127] .  Nonetheless,  more  robust  evidence  of  its  efﬁcacy  emerged
with  a  multicenter  randomized  clinical  trial  comparing  thera-
peutic  hypothermia  to  the  standard  medical  treatment.  This  study
included  270  patients  with  convulsive  SE  and  concluded  that
hypothermia  was  not  associated  with  a  lower  rate  of  progression
to  RSE  or  SRSE,  or  improved  clinical  outcomes  [128] .  Important
considerations  before  its  implementation  include  the  possible
interaction  with  anesthetics  and  ASDs  clearance  [121] ,  as  well  as
awareness  of  common  side  effects:  deep  venous  thrombosis,
infections,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  electrolyte  disturbances,  acute
intestinal  ischemia  and  coagulation  disorders  [55,129] .
Electroconvulsive  therapy  (ECT)  is  also  documented  for  the
treatment  of  SRSE  [130]  in  case  series  and  reports.  ECT  increases
GABA  levels,  leading  to  reduction  of  neuronal  metabolic  activity
and  interruption  of  seizures  through  the  induction  of  a  refractory
period  [131 –133] .  It  is  considered  in  children  with  focal  and
generalized  RSE,  with  variable  etiology  (e.g.  structural,  intractable
epilepsy)  in  whom  more  than  ﬁve  ASDs  have  been  administered
prior  to  ECT  [134 –136] .  In  these  case  reports  the  patients ’
outcomes  are  variable  ranging  from  transient  response  to  ECT
and  mild  improvement  of  seizure  frequency  [135]  to  no  clinical
improvement  followed  by  death  [134] .  Administering  acute  ECT  is
logistically  challenging  because  its  availability  in  some  centers  is
limited.  The  side  effects  reported  in  the  literature  include  transient
lethargy  or  amnesic  events  [135] ,  though  most  of  the  studies  fail  to
document  this  information.
Another  non-pharmacological  option  includes  the  vagus  nerve
stimulation  [137 –142] .  Similar  to  ECT,  there  is  certainly  no
evidence  that  suggest  consistent  improvement  in  seizure  control
based  on  the  current  data.
Emergency  epilepsy  surgery  should  be  considered  for  RSE  and
SRSE  treatment  in  two  scenarios:  failure  to  maximal  medical
therapy  for  at  least  two  weeks  or  when  a  structural  abnormality  is
identi ﬁed  [143] .  Although  surgery  is  generally  contemplated  in  the
late  course  of  RSE,  patients  may  undergo  surgery  as  early  as  eight
days  after  SE  onset  [84].  Since  typical  pre-operative  diagnostic
tools  such  as  cortical  mapping  are  challenging  to  obtain  in  an  ICU
setting,  emergency  surgery  must  be  carefully  weighed.  The  initial
diagnostic  approach  includes  the  identi ﬁcation  of  the  epilepto-
genic  focus  on  EEG.  Prior  literature  in  children  with  RSE  treated
with  surgery  showed  that  common  EEG  features  include  general-
ized  or  non-focal  lateralized  discharges  [144] .  However,  in  some
cases  these  ﬁndings  can  be  hindered  by  the  use  of  barbiturates  and
BZDs.  If  that  is  the  case,  ancillary  testing  such  as  ictal  single-photon
emission  computerized  tomography  (SPECT),  MRI  and  possiblymagneto-encephalogram  (MEG)  should  be  utilized.  If  a  structural
lesion  is  identi ﬁed,  the  extent  of  the  lesion  should  be  further
characterized  through  the  mapping  of  the  eloquent  cortex  and
deﬁnition  of  the  epileptogenic  zone  [143] .
3.  Outcomes  of  RSE  and  SRSE  in  children
3.1.  Clinical  outcomes
The  nature  of  RSE/SRSE  is  highly  heterogeneous  and  several
factors  may  contribute  to  the  patients ’  prognosis.  Mortality
estimates  in  pediatric  RSE  are  13.7 –43.5%  [8–10,24] ,  related  to
etiology,  patients ’  age  (<3  years  old),  and  initial  EEG  ﬁndings  (i.e.
multifocal  or  generalized  abnormalities)  [8].  The  underlying
etiology  is  usually  recognized  as  a  primary  predictor  of  outcomes
[6,7,24,145,146] .  Patients  presenting  with  RSE  due  to  acute
symptomatic  etiologies  are  less  likely  to  return  to  baseline
neurological  function  and  are  at  higher  risk  of  developing  drug-
resistant  epilepsy  [145] .  Similarly,  existing  evidence  shows  that
patients  with  treatment  delays  [147] ,  longer  RSE  duration  [41,148] ,
and  those  who  present  with  non-convulsive  SE  have  worse  clinical
outcomes  [149] .
Not  only  are  patients  with  RSE/SRSE  at  risk  for  higher
mortality,  they  are  also  at  risk  for  neurological  and  systemic
complications  as  a  consequence  of  the  prolonged  length  of  ICU
stay  and  anesthetic  use.  While  the  data  for  SRSE  is  scarce,  a  series
of  10  children  with  SRSE  showed  a  median  ICU  and  hospital
length  stay  of  27  and  62  days,  respectively;  and  a  mortality  rate  of
11.1%  [35].  Another  study  identi ﬁed  43  SRSE  patients  out  of  305
children  with  SE.  The  patients  in  the  SRSE  cohort  presented  more
often  with  adverse  events  due  to  medications.  This  cohort  had  a
case  fatality  rate  of  21.3%  when  compared  to  the  5.1%  in  all  the
analyzed  SE  children  [15].  ICU  related  comorbidities  include
hypotension,  prolonged  respiratory  failure,  sepsis,  pneumonia,
urinary  tract  infections  and  prolonged  immobility  [53].  Moreover,
as  these  patients  are  often  on  multiple  therapies,  systemic
complications  may  arise  from  interactions  between  medications
or  their  adverse  effects.  A  study  of  171  adult  patients  with  SE
evaluated  the  outcome  of  patients  who  were  treated  with  IV
anesthetic  drugs  (37%).  After  controlling  for  confounders,  the
authors  found  that  the  use  of  CIs  was  associated  with  increased
frequency  of  infections  during  SE  as  well  as  a  2.9-fold  relative  risk
for  death.  Additionally,  these  patients  had  higher  rates  of
intubation,  severe  hypotension  and  poor  functional  outcome
on  the  Glasgow  Outcome  Score  at  long-term  follow-up  [150] .
Similarly,  there  is  evidence  in  children  with  febrile  RSE  that
induction  of  therapeutic  burst-suppression  may  lead  to  increased
risk  of  hemodynamic  instability  and  poor  outcomes  as  compared
to  electrographic  seizure  control  [151] .  Two  retrospective  case
series  showed  that  recurrence  of  SE  after  initiation  of  pentobarbital
was  associated  with  worse  neurologic  outcomes,  suggesting  that  it
should  be  considered  as  a  poor  prognostic  factor  [10,152] .  The
direct  association  between  CIs  use  and  clinical  outcomes  in  RSE/
SRSE  warrants  further  investigation.  It  remains  unclear  whether
worse  outcomes  are  a  result  of  the  administration  of  CIs  and  their
side  effects,  the  natural  progression  of  a  more  severe  case  of  RSE/
SRSE  or  a  combination  of  these  two.  We  consider  urgent  that  future
studies  address  the  adequate  approach  to  CI  administration
regarding  dosing,  up  titration  versus  substituting  for  another
anesthetic  infusion,  as  well  as  the  treatment  goals  in  view  of  a
potential  impact  on  clinical  outcomes.
4.  Conclusion
RSE  is  a  neurological  emergency  in  the  pediatric  population.
Literature  on  SRSE  in  children  is  limited  despite  the  morbidity68  A.  Vasquez  et  al.  /  Seizure  68  (2019)  62–71associated  with  this  disorder.  Current  clinical  practice  is  chal-
lenged  by  the  heterogeneous  etiologies  and  multiple  factors
involved  in  the  progression  from  SE  to  RSE  and  SRSE.  Moreover,
there  is  a  need  to  understand  how  aggressively  RSE/SRSE  patients
should  be  treated  initially,  as  the  intrinsic  risks  of  treatment  and
their  effect  on  clinical  outcomes  should  be  taken  into  consider-
ation.  A  multicenter  and  multinational  collaborative  effort  is
desirable  to  evaluate  epidemiological  data  on  pediatric  RSE/SRSE,
prevention  strategies  and  available  therapeutic  options  in  order  to
provide  more  deﬁnitive  evidence  for  their  efﬁcacy  and  safety  in
RSE  and  SRSE.
