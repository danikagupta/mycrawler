Characterization and heterologous
production of a novel laccase fromMelanocarpus albomyces
Laccases are copper-containing enzymes that oxidize a variety of
industrially relevant substrates. In order to fully exploit laccases in
industrial processes, novel laccases with good technical properties are
needed. This work focused on identifying and characterizing novel fungal
laccases having potential for the applications as well as on development of
efficient production methods for laccases.
A novel laccase from the ascomycete Melanocarpus albomyces  was
characterized. Interestingly, M. albomyces  laccase showed good thermo-
stability and it had a pH optimum at neutral pH. The crystal structure of M.
albomyces  laccase was resolved and the overall structure was shown to be
similar to other blue copper oxidases. The gene encoding M. albomyces
laccase was isolated and expressed heterologously in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae  and Trichoderma reesei . Finally, this work showed for the first
time that a laccase can adsorb on cellulose, as M. albomyces  laccase was
shown to bind to lignocellulose and purified cellulose.

Abstract 
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are multicopper oxidases that catalyze oxidation of 
various substituted phenolic compounds, ar omatic amines and even certain 
inorganic compounds by using molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor. Their substrate versatility makes laccases highly interesting for various applications, 
including textile dye bleaching, pulp bleaching and bioremediation, where 
enzymatic catalysis could serve as a more environmentally benign alternative than the currently used chem ical processes. However, most laccases studied thus 
far are not well-suited for the applications  because of their low stability at high 
temperatures or pH values. This work focused on identifying and characterizing novel fungal laccases having potential for the applications as well as on development of efficient production methods for laccases. 
Laccase-producing fungi were screened fro m various environmental samples by 
plate tests using the indicator compounds guaiacol, tannic acid and the polymeric dyes Remazol brilliant blue R and Poly R-478. A total of 26 positive 
fungal strains were isolated, and their ab ility to produce laccase was studied in 
liquid media. Four fungal strains produced significant amounts of laccase, and these enzymes were preliminarily charact erized. The novel laccases were found 
to be rather typical basidiomycete laccases, although they had notably high thermostabilities as compared to other fungal laccases. 
A novel laccase from the ascomycete Melanocarpus albomyces  was purified and 
biochemically characterized. The substr ate specificity and susceptibility towards 
inhibitors were shown to be typical for laccases. Spectral data measured for the purified laccase indicated that the characteristic three types of copper were present. Interestingly, M. albomyces  laccase showed good thermostability and it 
had a pH optimum at neutral pH with phenolic substrates. Both of these are 
unusual properties for fungal laccases. The crystal structure of M. albomyces   
4 laccase containing all four copper atoms was resolved at 2.4 Å resolution. The 
overall structure was shown to consis t of three cupredoxin-like domains, 
similarly to other blue copper oxidases. Surprisingly, elongated electron density 
was observed in the trinuclear center, indicating binding of a dioxygen molecule 
with a novel geometry. In addition, an  exceptional C-terminal end, which 
protrudes into the active site of the enzyme, was detected. 
The gene encoding M. albomyces  laccase was isolated and it was shown to 
encode a protein of 623 amino acids. The level of homology of the laccase was about 60-70% with laccases from other ascomycetes and about 30% with basidiomycete laccases. Maturation of M. albomyces  laccase was shown to 
consist of the removal of a putative signal sequence, a propeptide and a C-
terminal extension. M. albomyces laccase cDNA was expressed in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  under the inducible GAL1  promoter. Very low laccase 
production was detected with the expression construct containing laccase cDNA with its own signal and propeptide se quences. The production was significantly 
improved by replacing these with the prepro-sequence of the S. cerevisiae  α-
factor gene. Further six-fold improvement in the production level was obtained by introducing a stop codon into the cDNA after the native C-terminal 
processing site. These results suggested th at correct post-translational processing 
was essential for efficient production of M. albomyces laccase in S. cerevisiae . 
M. albomyces laccase was also expressed in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma 
reesei . The laccase was expressed as a non-fu sed laccase and as a fusion protein 
that contained the T. reesei  hydrophobin I protein at the N-terminus. About five 
times higher activity levels were obtaine d with the non-fused laccase than with 
the fusion protein in shake flask cultur es. Analyses of transformants from both 
expression constructs indicated that prod uction of the fusion protein was limited 
at the post-transcriptional level by proteolytic degradation and inefficient secretion. No induction of the unfolded response pathway by laccase production was detected in the transformants. The unmodified recombinant M. albomyces  
laccase was produced in batch and fed-ba tch fermentations and the production 
level of 920 mg l
-1 in the fed-batch cultivation was the highest heterologous 
laccase production level hitherto reported. Recombinant M. albomyces  laccase 
was purified and biochemically character ized and it was shown to be very 
similar to the native laccase.  
5 This work also showed for the first ti me that a laccase can adsorb on cellulose, 
as M. albomyces  laccase was shown to bind to lignocellulose and purified 
cellulose. The binding isotherm obtained with bacterial microcrystalline cellulose fitted well the Langmuir type one-site binding model. The adsorption parameters obtained from the model indicated that M. albomyces  laccase binds 
to cellulose very efficiently but with  a relatively low binding capacity. The 
binding was shown to be reversible and not  influenced by non-specific protein or 
the presence of salt. No binding  was detected with laccases from Trametes 
hirsuta  or Mauginiella  sp., which suggests that binding to cellulose is not a 
common feature among laccases.

11 1. Introduction 
Proteins that contain copper atoms as cofactors are crucial for numerous 
reactions in cellular metabolism. They are involved in photosynthesis, oxidative 
phosphorylation, metal ion homeostasis a nd catabolism of various nutrients and 
toxic chemical compounds. The incorporation of copper atoms in protein structures allows the proteins to perform electron transfer reactions involved in the above-mentioned processes, because copper atoms are able to switch their oxidation states between Cu
I and CuII. The protein structure functions as a 
complex polymeric ligand for the catalytically active coppers, providing them with a coordination environment where switches between the reduction states 
are thermodynamically feasible. The structurally simplest copper-containing proteins, such as plant plastocyanins and bacterial azurins, are typically electron-carriers invo lved in electron-transfer r eaction chains. More complex 
copper proteins are generally oxidor eductases, i.e. enzymes that catalyze 
oxidation/reduction reactions. Examples of these are microbial galactose oxidase, laccase and nitrite reductase, mammalian ceruloplasmin and plant ascorbate oxidase. 
Several copper-containing enzymes have  more than one copper atom in the 
active center. The combination of various  copper sites in one protein molecule 
allows the enzyme to catalyze reactions that involve the transfer of several 
electrons at a time. This is especially important when molecular oxygen is used as an electron acceptor in the catalytic cycle, since oxygen derivatives generated 
by single electron transfers are highl y detrimental to the cell. Multicopper 
oxidases typically contain two or four copper atoms per protein molecule and 
they catalyze oxidation reactions in which electrons are removed from the 
reducing substrate molecules and transferred to oxygen to form water or hydrogen peroxide. Examples of multicopper oxidases are ceruloplasmin, ascorbate oxidase, ferredoxin, phenoxazinone synthase, bilirubin oxidase and laccase. Ceruloplasmin (EC 1.16.3.1) is a ferredoxin which is essential for iron 
homeostasis in plasma. Its corresponding re presentative in yeast has been shown 
to be yeast ferredoxin Fet3p (Hasset et al. 1998). Plant ascorbate oxidase (EC 1.10.3.3) is apparently involved in ba lancing the reduction potential in growing 
cells, but its actual function is not ye t known (Pignocchi et al. 2003). Laccases 
(p-benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC  1.10.3.2) are multicopper oxidases 
present mainly in plants and fungi. They are structurally homologous to  
12 ceruloplasmin and ascorbate oxidase and are interesting as model enzymes for 
multicopper oxidases. Laccases are also of pa rticular interest with regard to 
potential industrial applications, becau se of their capability to oxidize a wide 
range of industrially relevant substrates. 
1.1 Distribution of laccases and their physiological roles 
Laccases are common enzymes in nature, and they are found widely in plants and fungi as well as in some bacteria a nd insects. The first laccase was reported 
in 1883 from Rhus vernicifera , the Japanese lacquer tree (review: Reinhammar 
1984), from which the designation l accase was derived.  Laccases have 
subsequently been discovered from numerous other plants, for example sycamore (Bligny and Douce 1983), poplar  (Ranocha et al. 1999), tobacco (De 
Marco and Roubelakis-Angelakis 1997) a nd peach (Lehman et al. 1974). Plant 
laccases are found in the xylem, where they presumably oxidize monolignols in 
the early stages of lignification (Bao et al. 1993; OMalley et al. 1993; Mayer and Staples 2002; Gavnholt and Larsen 2002). In addition, laccases have been shown to be involved in the first step s of healing in wounded leaves (De Marco 
and Roubelakis-Angelakis 1997) . Detection and purification of plant laccases is 
often difficult because crude plant extracts contain a large number of oxidative enzymes with broad substrate specificities (Ranocha et al. 1999), which is probably the reason why detailed informa tion about the biochemical properties 
of plant laccases is limited. However, Rhus  vernicifera  laccase is an exception which 
has been extensively studied, especially w ith regard to its spectroscopic properties 
(e.g. Malmström et al. 1970 ; Woolery et al. 1984). R. vernicifera  laccase has also 
widely been used in investigations of  the general reaction mechanism of laccases 
(Lee et al. 2002; Battistuzzi et al. 2003; Johnson et al. 2003). 
The majority of laccases characterized so far have been derived from fungi, 
especially from white-rot basidiomycetes th at are efficient lignin degraders. 
Well-known laccase-producers include fungi such as Agaricus bisporus  (Wood 
1980), Botrytis cinerea  (Marbach et al. 1984), Chaetomium thermophilum  
(Chefetz et al. 1998), Coprinus cinereus  (Schneider et al. 1999), Neurospora 
crassa (Froehner and Eriksson 1974), Phlebia radiata  (Niku-Paavola et al. 
1988), Pleurotus ostreatus  (Sannia et al. 1986), Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  
(Eggert et al. 1996b) and Trametes (Coriolus, Polyporus) versicolor  (Rogalski et  
13 al. 1991). The physiological roles of fu ngal laccases are various. Laccases from 
white-rot fungi, such as Trametes versicolor  and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus , 
participate in lignin biodegradation, wh ere they mainly ox idize the phenolic 
subunits of lignin (Bourbonnais and Pai ce 1990; Eggert et al. 1996a; Eggert et 
al. 1996b; Thurston 1994; Hatakka 2001). In  plant-pathogenic fungi, laccases are 
important virulence factors. The grapevine grey mould, Botrytis cinerea , 
produces a laccase that is necessary for pat hogenesis, and the role of the laccase 
is presumably related to detoxification of toxic defence metabolites produced by 
the plant (Bar-Nun et al. 1988). Laccases have  also been shown to be important 
for pathogenesis in the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica  (Rigling 
and van Alfen 1991; Choi et al. 1992; Mayer and Staples 2002) and in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans  (Williamson 1994). In Aspergillus 
nidulans , laccase activity is related to pigment production, and deletion of the 
laccase gene yA abolishes the green color of conidial spores (Clutterbuck 1972; 
Aramayo and Timberlake 1993; Adams et  al. 1998). Laccases have also been 
proposed to participate in fungal morphogenesis in Armillaria  spp. (Worral et al. 
1986),  Lentinus edodes  (Leatham and Stahmann 1981) and Volvariella volvacea  
(Chen et al. 2004). 
Only a few bacterial laccases have been described hitherto. The first bacterial 
laccase was detected in the pl ant root-associated bacterium Azospirillum 
lipoferum  (Givaudan et al. 1993), where it was shown to be involved in melanin 
formation (Faure et al. 1994). An atypical laccase containing six putative copper-binding sites was discovered from Marinomonas mediterranea , but no 
functional role has been assigned to th is enzyme (Solano et al. 1997; Sanchez-
Amat et al. 2001). Bacillus subtilis  produces a thermostable CotA laccase which 
participates in pigment production in th e endospore coat (Martins et al. 2002). 
Laccases have recently also been found from Streptomyces cyaneus  (Arias et al. 
2003) and Streptomyces lavendulae  (Suzuki et al. 2003). In addition to plants, 
fungi and bacteria, laccases or laccase- like activities have been found in some 
insects, where they have been suggested to be active in cuticle sclerotization 
(Sugumaran et al. 1992; Dittmer et al. 2004).  
14 1.2 Structure and catalytic mechanism of laccases 
The overall fold of laccases comprises three cupredoxin-like domains A, B and C, 
that are about equal in size (Figure 1; Ducros et al. 1998; Bertrand et al. 2002; Piontek et al. 2002; Enguita et al. 2003). The cupredoxin fold is common among copper-containing proteins, and it has also been found in the simple copper proteins plant plastocyanin (Guss and Freeman 1983; Inoue et al. 1999) and bacterial azurin (Norris et al. 1983), as well as in the more complex multicopper oxidases ascorbate oxidase (Messerschm idt et al. 1992) and ceruloplasmin 
(Zaitseva et al. 1996; Murphy et al. 1997). All three domains are important for the catalytic activity of laccases: the subs trate-binding site is located in a cleft 
between domains B and C, a mononuclear copper center is located in domain C, and a trinuclear copper center is locate d at the interface between domains A and 
C (Figure 1). The mononuclear copper center contains one type-1 (T1) copper atom that is trigonally coordinated to two histidines and a cysteine. The 
coordination bond between T1 and S
Cys is highly covalent, which causes a strong 
absorption around 600 nm and gives laccases their typical blue color (Solomon et al. 1996). T1 also has an distant axial ligand which is a leucine or 
phenylalanine residue in fungal laccases (Ducros et al. 1998; Bertrand et al. 2002; III; Piontek et al. 2002) and a methionine residue in the bacterial Bacillus 
subtilis  CotA laccase and in other multicopper oxidases (Enguita et al. 2003; 
Messerschmidt 1997). The trinuclear clus ter contains one type-2 (T2) copper 
atom and a pair of type-3 (T3) coppers  (Messerschmidt 1997). The T2 copper is 
coordinated by two and the T3 copper atoms by six conserved histidines 
(Bertrand et al. 2002; III; Piontek et al. 2002). The T1 and T2 coppers are paramagnetic and can be identified in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
spectrum. The T3 copper pair is antiferromagnetically coupled by a bridging hydroxide, which makes the T3 coppers EPR-silent (Solomon et al. 1996). However, they can be detected by th eir characteristic absorbance at 330 nm 
(Solomon et al. 1996).

Laccases are defined in the Enzyme Commission (EC) nomenclature as 
oxidoreductases which oxidize diphenol s and related substances and use 
molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor. In contrast to most enzymes, which are generally very substrate specific, laccases act on a surprisingly broad range 
of substrates, including diphenols, polyphe nols, different substituted phenols, 
diamines, aromatic amines, benzenethiols, and even some inorganic compounds such as iodine (Xu 1996). When oxidi zed by a laccase, the reducing substrate 
loses a single electron and usually forms a free radical (Kersten et al. 1990; Thurston 1994). The unstable radical may undergo further laccase-catalysed oxidation or non-enzymatic reactions in cluding hydration, disproportionation, 
and polymerisation (Thurston 1994). Figure 2 shows the schematic laccase-catalyzed oxidation of a p-diphenol (A) and the commonly used nonphenolic 
laccase substrate ABTS [2,2-azinobis-(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate)] 
(B). Other well-known substrates for laccases include syringaldazine (3,5- 
16 dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde azine), 1-naphthol, p-cresol (1-hydroxy-4-
methylbenzene), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol  and guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol).

The reduction of oxygen takes place in th e trinuclear copper center which is 
located about 12 Å away from T1 (Bertrand et al. 2002; Piontek et al. 2002). One catalytic cycle involves the transfer of altogether four electrons, which are 
carried from T1 to the T2/T3 cluster presumably through a conserved His-Cys-His tripeptide (Messerschmidt et al. 1992; Bertrand et al. 2002; Piontek et al. 2002). The reaction mechanism of laccase s has been studied intensively by 
monitoring the coordination states of the coppers during the reaction cycle by spectroscopical methods, such as EPR, ma gnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and 
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS); how ever, particularly the mechanism of 
oxygen reduction in the trinuc lear center is still unclear (Cole et al. 1990; Shin et 
al. 1996; Solomon et al. 1996; Lee et al. 2002). The first step of the catalytic cycle of laccases involves the formation of  a fully reduced laccase in which all 
four coppers are in a reduced state (Shin et al. 1996; Solomon et al. 1996; Lee et al. 2002). Molecular oxygen then oxidizes the fully reduced laccase, presumably via a peroxy intermediate, and is reduced to water (Shin et al. 1996; Solomon et al. 1996; Lee et al. 2002). According to Lee et al. (2002), the oxidation of the peroxy intermediate generates an oxygen- activated native intermediate laccase, 
in which all four coppers are in oxidize d form and the three trinuclear copper 
atoms are all bridged by hydroxide or oxo groups. This bridging makes the native intermediate prone to reduction a nd it can quickly enter another catalytic 
cycle (Lee et al. 2002). In contrast to the native intermediate, the resting oxidized laccase is proposed to have a T2  copper that is electronically isolated 
from the two T3 coppers, and the resting oxi dized form is reduced by substrates 
at a much slower rate than the native intermediate (Lee et al. 2002). The native 
intermediate slowly transforms into th e resting oxidized form in the absence of 
reducing substrates. 
The suitability of a chemical compound as a laccase substrate depends on two 
factors. Firstly, the substrate must dock at the T1 copper site, which is mainly 
determined by the nature and position of substituents on the phenolic ring of the 
substrate, especially those with bulky side chains (Xu 1996; Bertrand et al. 2002). Secondly, the redox-potential ( E
0) of the substrate must be low enough, 
because the rate of a laccase-catalyzed r eaction has been shown to depend on the 
difference between the redox-potentials of the enzyme and the substrate, ∆E
0[laccase-substrate] (Xu 1996; Xu et al. 1996; Xu et al. 2000; Xu et al. 2001). 
The redox-potential of the substrate is de termined by its chemical structure, and  
18 different substituents have different impacts on the E0[substrate] depending on 
their propensity to withdraw or donate electrons (Xu 1996). Methoxy substituents, for example, are electron- donating and increase the electron density 
at the phenoxy group, thus making it more readily oxidized (Xu 1996; Garzillo et al. 1998). 
The redox-potentials of laccases vary from 0.4 to 0.8 V, and the most critical 
factor determining the E
0[laccase] is the coordination sphere of the T1 copper 
(Xu et al. 1996; Palmer et al. 1999; Xu et al. 1999). The axial ligand has been proposed to be especially important for the redox-potential, because other 
multicopper oxidases that have a coordina ting Met in this position have lower 
redox-potentials than laccases, in which the axial ligand is usually a non-coordinating phenylalanine or leucine residue (Palmer et al. 1999; Xu et al. 1999). This was studied by mutating the corresponding Phe to Met in Trametes 
villosa  laccase, and the results showed that the E
0 of the mutated laccase was 
indeed lowered by 0.1 V (Xu et al. 1999). The nature of the non-coordinating axial ligand has also been suggested to be important, because high E
0 laccases 
generally have a Phe at this position wh ereas a Leu is usually found in the low 
E0 laccases (Eggert et al. 1998). This hypothesis has been studied by mutating 
the corresponding Leu to Phe in the low redox-potential Myceliophthora 
thermophila  and Rhizoctonia solani  laccases (Xu et al. 1998), and vice versa in 
the high E0 Trametes villosa  laccase (Xu et al. 1999). However, these mutations 
did not have any effect on the redox-pote ntials of the enzymes (Xu et al. 1998; 
Xu et al. 1999). On the basis of these r esults and the three-dimensional structure 
of Trametes versicolor  laccase, Piontek et al. (2002) recently suggested that the 
E0[laccase] is actually determined by a relatively large network of interactions, 
such as hydrogen bonds around the T1 site, which affect the bond lengths between the coordinating N
His and the T1 copper atom. According to Piontek et 
al. (2002), hydrogen bonds that stretch a coordinating histidine residue away 
from the T1 may decrease the electron density of the copper atom, thus making it more electron deficient. In addition, it must be taken into account that other factors in the vicinity of the T1 site , such as solvent accessibility and charge 
distribution, may contribute to the oxidation potential of laccases (Xu et al. 1996; Garzillo et al. 2001). Recently it was also reported that the expression host affected the E
0 of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  laccase, and it was suggested that 
this resulted from differences introduced during protein folding or glycosylation (Sigoillot et al. 2004).  
19 Coordination chemistry of the coppers is also related to the impact mechanism 
of many laccase inhibitors. The most effective laccase inhibitors are small anions, especially azide, cyanide, and fluor ide ions, which bind to the trinuclear 
copper center and interfere with the electron flow (Solomon et al. 1996; Xu 1996, Battistuzzi et al. 2003; Johnson et al. 2003). Other laccase inhibitors include EDTA, fatty acids, tropolone, kojic  acid and coumaric acid, but their 
inhibitory concentrations are generally higher than those of the small anions (Wood 1980, Bollag and Leonowicz 1984; Faure et al. 1995; Eggert et al. 1996b; Chefetz et al. 1998; Sethuraman et al. 1999; Xu 1999; Jung et al. 2002). Many sulfhydryl-containing compounds, such as 
L-cysteine, dithiothreitol and 
thioglycolic acid, have also often b een considered as laccase inhibitors. 
However, when the effect of inhibitors  has been further studied by the oxygen 
consumption method instead of absorban ce measurements, it has been found that 
the observed inhibition was actually caused by reduction of the oxidized substrate by the sulfhydryl compounds and not by inhibition of the enzyme (Johannes and Majcherczyk 2000). 
1.3 Biochemical properties of laccases 
The catalytic action of an enzyme is quantitatively described by the Michaelis 
constant Km and the catalytic efficiency constant kcat. These constants have been 
measured for a large number of laccases, and rather great variance can be observed among them (Table 1). The K
m values of laccases are generally in the 
range of 2500 µM depending on the enzyme source and the reducing substrate 
(Table 1). The lowest Km values have been measured with syringaldazine, which 
is a dimer of two molecules of 2,6-di methoxyphenol linked by an azide bridge. 
Either the azide bridge or the dimer form is apparently beneficial for the affinity 
of syringaldazine to laccases, because the Km values measured for monomeric 
2,6-dimethoxyphenol are generally higher than those obtained with syringaldazine (Table 1). The comparison of K
m values also shows that laccases 
from different source organisms have different substrate preferences (Xu et al. 1996). The specificity for oxygen is less dependent on the enzyme, and K
m 
values of 2050 µM for O 2 have been reported for several laccases (Yaver et al. 
1999; Xu 2001).  
20 Very significant variance has also been observed in the catalytic efficiencies 
(kcat) of various laccases. Differences as high as 3500-fold can be seen in the kcat 
values between different laccases with the same substrates (Table 1). On the other hand, the k
cat values for a single laccase do not generally differ more than 
210-fold between different substrat es, which reflects the fact that kcat describes 
the rate of the electron-transfer reactions taking place inside the enzyme after substrate binding (Xu 2001). This can be seen, for example, for laccases from Pleurotus sajor-caju , Trametes pubescens  and Trametes trogii  in Table 1. 
However, the variance in assay conditions  must always be taken into account 
when the catalytic constants measured in different laboratories are compared. The constants in Table 1 have been m easured in varying pH, ionic strength and 
temperature conditions and using different  protein concentrations, all of which 
have a great effect on the results. In  addition, different molar extinction 
coefficients for oxidation products have sometimes been used in 
spectrophotometric assays, because the nature of the actual oxidation products is often complex or poorly understood. This  affects particularly the numerical 
values of k
cat.

In addition to the kinetic constants, the catalytic performance of laccases is 
described by their activity and stabilit y in different pH and temperature 
conditions. The pH activity profiles of laccases are often bell-shaped, with 
optima around 46, when measured with  phenolic substrates (Hoffmann and 
Esser 1977; Palmieri et al. 1993; Eggert et al. 1996b; Xu 1997; Chefetz et al. 1998; Schneider et al. 1999; Garzillo et al. 2001). The decrease in laccase activity in neutral or alkaline pH valu es is affected by increasing hydroxide 
anion inhibition, because as a small anion, hydroxide ion is also a laccase inhibitor (Xu 1997). On the other hand, the increasing pH decreases the redox potential of the phenolic substrate, which makes the substrate more susceptible to oxidation by laccase (Xu 1997). The bell-shaped pH profile is thus the result of two opposite effects: increasing ∆E
0[laccase-substrate] and inhibition by 
hydroxide anion (Xu 1997). Oxidation of non-phenolic substrates, such as ABTS, does not involve proton exchange, and therefore nearly monotonic pH activity profiles with highest activities at pH values of 23 are obtained (Hoffmann and Esser 1977; Xu 1997; Garzillo et al. 2001). In contrast to their activity, the stability of laccases is generally highest at pH values around 89 (Nishizawa et al. 1995; Xu et al. 1996; Chefetz et al. 1998). 
Temperature stabilities of laccases vary considerably, depending on the source 
organism. In general, laccases are stable at 3050 °C and rapidly lose activity at 
temperatures above 60 °C (Wood 1980; Xu et al. 1996; Chefetz et al. 1998; 
Heinzkill et al. 1998; Schneider et al. 1999; Galhaup et al. 2002a; Jung et al. 2002; Palonen et al. 2003). The most ther mostable laccases have been isolated 
from bacteria; the half-life of Streptomyces lavendulae  laccase was 100 minutes 
at 70°C (Suzuki et al. 2003) and that of Bacillus subtilis  CotA was 112 minutes 
at 80°C (Martins et al. 2002). The typical half-lives of fungal laccases are clearly  
23 below one hour at 70 °C and below 10 minutes at 80 °C (Wood 1980; Nishizawa 
et al. 1995; Xu et al. 1996; Chefetz et al. 1998; Schneider et al. 1999; Galhaup et al. 2002a; Jung et al. 2002; Palonen et al. 2003). 
1.4 Molecular biology of laccases 
The first laccase genes were isolated and sequenced about 15 years ago from the fungi Neurospora crassa  (Germann et al. 1988), Aspergillus nidulans  (Aramayo 
and Timberlake 1990), Coriolus hirsutus  (Kojima et al. 1990) and Phlebia 
radiata  (Saloheimo et al. 1991). Since then, the number of laccase genes 
sequenced has increased considerably, and searches from protein and gene sequence databases currently yield sever al hundreds of laccase gene sequences. 
However, a significant number of these are only partial stretches of putative laccase genes that have been found in genome-wide sequencing projects and have been annotated on the basis of sequence homology with known laccases. 
The number of laccase genes of which the corresponding protein products have been experimentally characterized is sign ificantly lower. To date, there are about 
20 such enzymes, most of which are funga l laccases (Table 2). In addition to the 
genes shown in Table 2, several laccase genes have been characterized in detail at the nucleotide level but have not been specified to code for a known laccase protein.

biochemically characterized laccase protein.

25 A typical laccase gene codes for a protein of 500600 amino acids (Table 2). 
The coding regions of fungal laccase ge nes are usually intervened by 813 
introns of about 5090 basepairs in lengt h, and the splicing junctions generally 
adhere to the GT-AG rule (Padgett et al . 1984; Kojima et al. 1990; Saloheimo et 
al. 1991; Choi et al. 1992; Yaver et al. 1996; Yaver et al. 1999; Zhao and Kwan 1999; Galhaup et al. 2002a). There are, how ever, also some laccase genes that 
have only one intron ( Neurospora crassa laccase gene; Germann et al. 1988), as 
well as genes with even up to 19 introns ( Pleurotus ostreatus pox1 ; Giardina et 
al. 1995). Conserved intron positions ha ve been found in laccase genes only 
from the same fungal phylum, and this has been considered as an indicator of the 
evolutionary distance between basidiomycetous and ascomycetous fungi (Saloheimo et al. 1991; Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996; Berka et al. 1997b). All the fungal laccases listed in Table 2 are secreted proteins, and typical eukaryotic signal peptide sequences of about 20 amino acids are found at the N-
termini of the protein sequences. In addition to the secretion signal sequence, laccase genes from Neurospora crassa , Podospora anserina , Myceliophthora 
thermophila  and Coprinus cinereus  contain regions that code for N-terminal 
cleavable propeptides (Germann et al. 1988; Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996; 
Berka et al. 1997b; Yaver et al. 1999). These laccases also have C-terminal extensions, i.e. the last amino acids from the predicted amino acid sequence are not present in the mature protein (Germann et al. 1988; Berka et al. 1997b; Yaver et al. 1999). 
The molecular weights of laccases are usuall y in the range of 60 to 90 kDa when 
determined by SDS-PAGE (Table 2). The difference between the molecular weight 
(MW) predicted from the peptide sequence and the experimentally obtained MW is 
caused by glycosylation, which typically  accounts for about 1020% of the total 
MW (Froehner and Eriksson, 1974; Coll et al. 1993a; Giardina et al. 1996; Wahleithner et al. 1996; Dedeyan et al. 2000; Galhaup et al. 2002a). The isoelectric points of microbial laccases are generally around 36 (Table 2). However, many laccase-producing fungi pr oduce several laccase isoforms, and 
laccases with pIs at neutral or slightly  alkaline pH values have also been 
detected in several fungi, such as Podospora anserina  (Fernández-Larrea and 
Stahl 1996), Rhizoctonia solani  (Wahleithner et al. 1996), Trametes villosa  
(Yaver et al. 1996) and Pleurotus ostreatus  (Palmieri et al. 1997).  
26 Many fungal genomes contain more than one laccase gene. Trametes villosa , for 
example, contains at least five laccase genes (Yaver et al. 1996; Yaver and Golightly 1996),  Coprinus cinereus  at least eight (Hoegger et al. 2004), and 
Rhizoctonia solani  (Wahleithner et al. 1996), Pleurotus sajor-caju  (Soden and 
Dobson 2001) and Pleurotus ostreatus  (Palmieri et al. 2003) at least four laccase 
genes. The precise quantification of laccase genes is complicated by the existence of different laccase gene allel es in the chromosomes, because most of 
the studied laccase-producing fungi are diploid (Yaver et al. 1996; Eggert et al. 1998). Laccase proteins and thereby also  laccase genes are identified by the 
presence of four highly conserved copper binding motifs, all involving the sequence HXH and containing altogeth er 10 conserved histidines and one 
conserved cysteine (Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996; Yaver et al. 1999; Kumar et al. 2003). These copper binding regions can also be found in other multicopper oxidases, which complicates the identification of laccase genes without knowledge of the properties of the corresponding protein. For example, fungal ferroxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosporium  has been shown to be 
about 30% identical to fungal laccases, and it contains the same conserved copper binding residues as laccases (Larrondo et al. 2003b). 
The expression levels of different laccase genes typically depend on cultivation 
conditions. For example, high nitrogen cont ent of the medium has been shown to 
induce transcription of laccase genes in the Basidiomycete I-62 (CECT 20197) (Mansur et al. 1998) and in Pleurotus sajor-caju  (Soden and Dobson 2001). 
Copper is also often a strong inducer of laccase gene transcription, and this has 
been suggested to be related to a de fence mechanism against oxidative stress 
caused by free copper ions (Fernández- Larrea and Stahl 1996; Collins and 
Dobson 1997; Palmieri et al. 2000; S oden and Dobson 2001; Galhaup et al. 
2002a; Litvintseva and Henson 2002). In a ddition to copper, other metal ions 
such as Mg
2+, Cd2+ or Hg2+ can stimulate laccase expression (Scheel et al. 2000; 
Soden and Dobson 2001; Galhaup et al . 2002a). Certain aromatic compounds 
that are structurally related to lignin pr ecursors, such as 2,5-xylidine or ferulic 
acid, have also been shown to in crease laccase gene transcription in Trametes 
villosa , Trametes versicolor  and Pleurotus sajor-caju  (Yaver et al. 1996; Collins 
and Dobson 1997; Soden and Dobs on 2001). On the other hand, Trametes 
villosa  and Pleurotus sajor-caju  have also been shown to contain constitutively 
expressed laccase genes, and this may be re lated to different physiological roles 
of the various laccases in the fungi (Yaver et al. 1996; Soden and Dobson 2001).  
27 The transcriptional induction of laccase genes by metal ions and phenolic 
compounds has been suggested to result fro m the presence of specific regulatory 
sites in the promoter regions of the ge nes. The upstream regulatory regions of 
several laccase genes have been show n to contain putative metal-responsive 
elements (MRE) that have also been found in promoter regions of metallothionein proteins involved in metal homeostasis and detoxification 
(Karahanian et al. 1998; Mansur et al. 1998;  Giardina et al. 1999; Galhaup et al. 
2002a; Faraco et al. 2003). Furthermore,  putative heat-shock elements (HSE), 
xenobiotic response elements (XRE) and antioxidant response elements (ARE) 
have been discovered from the promoter regions of laccase genes (Saloheimo et al. 1991; Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996; Giardina et al. 1999; Soden and Dobson 2001; Galhaup et al. 2002a), although the roles of these regulatory 
regions have not yet been e xperimentally demonstrated. 
Comparison of laccase gene nucleotide sequences indicates that laccases can be 
divided into at least three different groups: basidiomycete, ascomycete and plant laccases (Eggert et al. 1998; Cassland a nd Jönsson 1999; Valderrama et al. 
2003). The level of amino acid identity between laccases from the same group is generally above 50%, whereas identity betw een laccases from different groups is 
below 40%. The translated laccase genes yA and tilA from the ascomycete 
Aspergillus nidulans  differ significantly from other laccase protein sequences 
(Aramayo and Timberlake 1990; Scherer and Fischer 2001); the level of amino 
acid identity between the predicted Aspergillus  laccases and other laccases is 
only about 30% based on BLAST similarity searches. Unfortunately, the substrate specificities of these laccases have not been characterized. The bacterial laccase proteins from Bacillus subtilis  (Martins et al. 2002) and 
Streptomyces lavendulae  (Suzuki et al. 2003) are 47% similar to each other but 
differ very much from other laccases. Pairwise similarity between the bacterial and fungal laccase proteins is less than 30% . The similarity of bacterial laccases 
is actually higher with other bacterial multicopper proteins, such as Streptomyces 
antibioticus  phenoxazinone synthase (Hsieh and Jones 1995) and Escherichia 
coli copper homeostasis protein CueO (Roberts et al. 2002), than with other 
laccases.  
28 1.5 Heterologous production of laccases 
Laccase genes are often expressed at very lo w levels in the native hosts. In order 
to improve laccase production, f ungal laccases have been expressed 
heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (Kojima et al. 1990), Trichoderma 
reesei  (Saloheimo and Niku-Paavola 1991), Aspergillus oryzae  (Yaver et al. 
1996; Wahleithner et al. 1996; Berka et al. 1997b; Yaver et al. 1999; Sigoillot et al. 2004), Pichia pastoris  (Jönsson et al. 1997; Otterbein et al. 2000; Brown et 
al. 2002; Soden et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2003), Aspergillus sojae  (Hatamoto et al. 
1999), Aspergillus niger  (Record et al. 2002; Larrondo et al. 2003a), Aspergillus 
nidulans  (Larrondo et al. 2003a), tobacco (LaFayette et al. 1999) and maize 
(Bailey et al. 2004). In addition, hete rologous yeast expression systems have 
been developed to facilitate protein en gineering of laccases (Gelo-Pujic et al. 
1999; Bulter et al. 2003) or to improve the resistance of yeast to phenolic growth inhibitors (Cassland and Jönsson 1999). Bacterial laccases from Bacillus subtilis  
and Streptomyces lavendulae  have been expressed in Escherichia coli  (Martins 
et al. 2002; Suzuki et al. 2003) but su ccessful expression of fungal laccases in E. 
coli has not been reported.  
Laccases have been expressed in Aspergillus  spp. under the control of the strong 
constitutive TAKA-amylase ( amyA ) (Yaver et al. 1996; Wahleithner et al. 1996; 
Berka et al. 1997b; Yaver et al. 1999; Larrondo et al. 2003a) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( gpdA ) promoters (Record et al. 2002). In 
Trichoderma reesei , the promoter region of the major cellulase gene cbh1  has 
been used (Saloheimo and Niku-Paavola 1991). Secretion of heterologous laccases has generally been directed by using native laccase signal sequences in the expression constructs. However, it may be possible to increase the production levels by using signal seque nces derived from host genes. For 
example, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  Lac1 was produced 80 times more 
efficiently in Aspergillus niger  when the laccase signal sequence was replaced 
by the prepro sequence of the A. niger  glucoamylase gene glaA  (Record et al. 
2002). The effect of signal sequences  on heterologous l accase production has 
also been studied in Pichia pastoris  strains expressing various laccases, but in 
these experiments the native laccase signal sequences have performed better than the commonly used N-term inal signal peptide from the S. cerevisiae  
mating-type factor MF
α gene (Jönsson et al. 1997; Brown et al. 2002; Soden et 
al. 2002; Liu et al. 2003).  
29 Laccase production levels have often been  improved significantly by expression 
in heterologous hosts, but the reported levels have still been rather low for 
industrial applications (Table 3). The highest yields have been obtained in 
filamentous fungi, especially in Aspergillus  spp. that are widely used in the 
production of industrial enzymes. Improve d laccase production levels have also 
been achieved by expression in Pichia pastoris , whereas expression in S. 
cerevisiae  has generally resulted in very low activity levels (Larsson et al. 2001; 
Bulter et al. 2003). The highest reported laccase production levels thus far have been obtained in homologous production sy stems in a shake fl ask cultivation of 
Pycnoporus cinnabarinus , which yielded 10001500 mg l
-1 laccase (Lomascolo 
et al. 2003), and a fermentor cultivation of Trametes pubescens , which yielded 
700 mg l-1 laccase (Galhaup et al. 2002b). The production of two bacterial laccases 
from Bacillus subtilis  and Streptomyces lavendulae  in E. coli  resulted in extensive 
intracellular aggregation of laccases (M artins et al. 2002; Suzuki et al. 2003). 
Bacillus subtilis  laccase could not be recovere d from the inclusion bodies, and 
only the soluble fraction representing about  10% of the heterologous laccase was 
purified (Martins et al. 2002). Streptomyces lavendulae  laccase was refolded to an 
active form after treatment with urea a nd 2-mercaptoethanol (Suzuki et al. 2003).

* The reported production levels have been obtained in shake flask cultivati ons, except in the case 
of Phlebia radiata  laccase which was produced in a laboratory fermentor.  
30 Production of heterologous laccase has often been improved by varying the 
cultivation conditions. For example, be tter production of heterologous laccase 
has been achieved in yeast systems by c ontrolling the pH of the culture medium 
and by lowering cultivation temperatures (Jönsson et al. 1997; Cassland and Jönsson 1999; Larsson et al. 2001; OCa llaghan et al. 2002; Soden et al. 2002; 
Liu et al. 2003). Buffering of the culture me dium to maintain the pH above 4 has 
been proposed to be important for stab ility of secreted laccases and inactivation 
of acidic proteases (Jönsson et al. 1997; Larsson et al. 2001; Soden et al. 2002), whereas lowered cultivation temperatures may result in better production due to 
improved folding of heterologous prot eins (Cassland and Jönsson 1999). In 
addition, overexpression of Sso2p, a membrane protein involved in the protein secretion machinery (Aalto et al. 1993), has been shown to improve heterologous laccase production in S. cerevisiae  (Larsson et al. 2001). The 
addition of copper into the culture medium  has also proved to be important for 
heterologous laccase production in Pichia pastoris  and Aspergillus  spp. 
(OCallaghan et al. 2002; Larrondo et al. 200 3a; Liu et al. 2003). In contrast to 
homologous laccase production, in which c opper addition often affects laccase 
gene expression, the increased laccase pr oduction by copper addition is probably 
related to improved folding of the ac tive laccase in heterologous production 
(Larrondo et al. 2003a). The importance of  adequate copper concentration for 
proper laccase folding was further corroborated by studies in which two genes related to copper-trafficking in Trametes versicolor  were overexpressed in S. 
cerevisiae  expressing Tr. versicolor lacIII  gene; the heterologous laccase 
production by S. cerevisiae  was improved up to 20-fold (Uldschmid et al. 2003). 
The effect was suggested to result from mo re efficient transport of copper to the 
Golgi compartment (Uldschmid et al. 2003). Directed evolution has also been used for improving heterologous laccase production. Mutations in the Myceliophthora thermophila  laccase gene resulted in the highest reported 
laccase production level in S. cerevisiae , 18 mg l
-1 (Bulter et al. 2003). 
1.6 Laccase applications 
Oxidation reactions are widely used in industrial processes, for example in the 
textile, food, wood processing, pharmaceuti cal and chemical industries. Many of 
the currently used oxidation methods are not economically or environmentally satisfactory, because they produce unwante d side reactions and the oxidants or  
31 reaction catalysts are often toxic. Enzy matic oxidation is a potential alternative 
to chemical methods, because enzymes are very specific and efficient catalysts, 
and are ecologically sustainable. Laccases are currently seen as very interesting enzymes for industrial oxidation reactions, because they are capable of oxidizing a wide variety of substrates. In additio n, they use readily available molecular 
oxygen as an electron acceptor instead of expensive cofactors such as NAD(P)
+. 
Laccases are currently studied intensivel y for many applications and they are 
already used in large scale in the textile  industry. Together with low molecular 
weight redox-mediator compounds, lacca ses can generate a desired worn 
appearance on denim by bleaching indigo dye (Pedersen and Kierulff 1996; Campos et al. 2001). They could also be used for decolorizing dye house effluents, that are hardly decolorized by conventional sewage treatment plants 
(Abadulla et al. 2000; Wesenberg et al. 2003) . In addition to dye house effluents, 
laccases can decolorize waste waters fro m olive oil mills (D'Annibale et al. 
2000; Dias et al. 2004) and pulp mills (Manzanares et al. 1995) by removing colored phenolic compounds. Another poten tial environmental application for 
laccases is the bioremediation of contaminated soils, as laccases are able to oxidize toxic organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Collins et al. 1996) and chlorophenols (Gia nfreda et al. 1999; Ahn et al. 2002). 
The most useful method for this applic ation would probably be inoculating the 
soil with fungi that are efficient laccas e-producers, because the use of isolated 
enzymes is not economically feasible for soil remediation in large scale. 
The involvement of fungal laccases in lignin biodegradation has raised interest 
in the use of laccases in lignocellulose processing. The proposed applications 
include pulp bleaching (Bourbonnais and Paice 1992; Call and Mücke 1997) and 
fiber modification (Felby et al. 1997; Chandra and Ragauskas 2002). Laccases are able to delignify pulp when they  are used together with mediators 
(Bourbonnais and Paice 1992; Call and Mücke 1997). The mediator is oxidized by laccase and the oxidized mediator molecule further oxidizes subunits of 
lignin that otherwise would not be laccase substrates (Bourbonnais and Paice 
1990; Bourbonnais and Paice 1992; Call and Mücke 1997). Although the laccase-mediator system has been studied  extensively, there are still unresolved 
problems concerned with mediator recycling, cost and toxicity. The capability of laccases to form reactive radicals in li gnin can also be used in targeted 
modification of wood fibers. For example, laccases can be used in the enzymatic  
32 adhesion of fibers in the manufacturing of lignocellulose-based composite 
materials, such as fiber boards. Laccase has been proposed to activate the fiber-
bound lignin during manufacturing of the composites, and boards with good mechanical properties have been obtained without toxic synthetic adhesives by using laccases (Felby et al. 1997; Hüttermann et al. 2001). Another possibility is to functionalize lignocellulosic fibers by laccases in order to improve the 
chemical or physical properties of the fiber products. Preliminary results have shown that laccases are able to graft various phenolic acid derivatives onto kraft pulp fibers (Lund and Ragauskas 2001;  Chandra and Ragauskas 2002). This 
ability could be used in the future to attach chemically versatile compounds to 
the fiber surfaces, possibly resulting in fi ber materials with completely novel 
properties, such as hydrophobicity or charge. 
Because laccases are able to catalyze elect ron-transfer reactions via a direct 
mechanism, i.e. without additional cofactor s, their use has also  been studied in 
biosensors that detect various phenolic  compounds (Ghindilis et al. 1992; Lisdat 
et al. 1997; Kulys and Vidziunaite 2003), oxygen (Gardiol et al. 1996) or azides (Leech and Daigle 1998). In addition to biosensors, laccases could be immobilized on the cathode of biofuel cells that could provide power, for 
example, for small transmitter systems (C hen et al. 2001; Calabrese Barton et al. 
2002). In the food industry laccases have potential in wine, fruit juice and beer stabilization by removing the polyphenols that cause haze formation and discoloration (Cantarelli et al. 1989; Giovanelli and Ravasini 1993; Minussi et al. 2002 and references therein). In additi on, laccases can be used in baking to 
improve the mixing properties of the dough and the structure of the baking product (Si 1993; Labat et al. 2001). A nove l application field for laccases is in 
cosmetics. For example, laccase-based hair dyes could be less irritant and easier to handle than current hair dyes (Roure et al. 1992; Aaslyng et al. 1996; Xu 1999). In the future laccases may also be of great interest in synthetic chemistry, where they have been proposed to be applicable for oxidative deprotection (Semenov et al. 1993) and production of complex polymers and medical agents (Xu 1999 and references therein; Mai et  al. 2000; Uyama and Kobayashi 2002; 
Kurisawa et al. 2003; Nicotra et al. 2004).  
33 1.7 Aims of the study 
Laccases are important and promising en zymes for various applications. Many 
known fungal laccases are active only in the acidic pH range and they are not sufficiently thermostable for industrial applications. The aim of the present work was to discover a novel alkaline and thermo stable laccase. The work also aimed 
at developing an efficient production sy stem for the laccase,  because relatively 
low production levels have hitherto hi ndered the efficient exploitation of 
laccases. More specifically, the aims were: 
1. Testing of simple screening methods to isolate novel fungal laccases 
from environmental samples. 
2. Purification, biochemical characteriza tion and structure determination of 
the novel laccase from Melanocarpus albomyces .  
3. Cloning of the gene encoding M. albomyces  laccase and its expression 
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and Trichoderma reesei . 
4. Characterization of the recombinant M. albomyces  laccase produced in 
T. reesei . 
  
34 2. Materials and methods 
The materials and methods used in this study are described in detail in the original 
publications IVI. A gene ral outline of the methodology is presented below. 
2.1 Laccase activity measurements 
Laccase activity was measured by monito ring the oxidation of 5 mM ABTS in 
25 mM succinate buffer (pH 4.5) at 436 nm at 25ºC. The activities were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 29 300 M
-1 cm-1 (Niku-Paavola et al. 
1988) and expressed as katals (mol s-1). In addition, specific activities for 
purified laccases were measured with three other substrates: syringaldazine (525 nm; ε 65 000 M
-1 cm-1; Leonowicz and Grzywnowicz 1981), 2,6-
dimethoxyphenol (469 nm; ε 49 600 M-1 cm-1; Wariishi et al. 1992), and 
guaiacol (465 nm; ε 12 100 M-1 cm-1; Paszczynski et al. 1985) in 25 mM 
succinate buffer (pH 4.5) (II) or in 40 mM MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6) (V). 
2.2 Screening for lacca se-positive fungi (I) 
Laccase-producing fungi were screened from several samples taken in Finland: 
decomposing tree stump, oak leaf compost, birch log, spruce chip pile and VTT test compost of municipal biowaste at different composting stages. In addition, crude cork material and process waters of a Portuguese cork factory (A. Silva, Porto, Portugal) and soiled pulp from a pulp mill in Svetogorsk, Russia, were 
used as sources of laccase-producing fungi . Fungi were cultivated by placing 
pieces of samples on malt extract agar and potato dextrose agar plates containing the following indicator compounds: 0.04% (w/v) Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), 0.04% Poly R-478, 0.01% guaiaco l or 0.5% tannic acid. In addition, 
0.01% (w/v) chloramphenicol and chlorote tracycline were added to the media in 
order to inhibit the growth of bacteria and 1% Benomyl in order to select for wood decay fungi (Maloy 1974). The plates were incubated at  30ºC and positive 
strains were subcultured when clear positive color reactions were detected. 
Fungal strains indicating laccase production in the plate test were grown in 
different types of liquid media and the production of laccase was monitored with activity measurements.  
35 2.3 Production and purification of native Melanocarpus 
albomyces  laccase (II, III) 
Melanocarpus albomyces  (VTT D-96490) was cultivated in shake flasks at 37ºC 
on a rotary shaker (160 rpm). Extracel lular laccase activity was assayed daily 
from the culture filtrate and the enzyme  was collected when laccase activity 
reached its maximum. 
The mycelium was removed by filtration through Whatman n:o 1 filter paper 
and the buffer was changed to 10 mM acetate buffer (pH 5) by ultrafiltration. M. 
albomyces  laccase was purified with three chromatographic steps at room 
temperature (Table 4).

Crystallisation of the purified M. albomyces  laccase, collection of x-ray 
diffraction data and determination of the crystal structure were performed at the 
Department of Chemistry, University of Joensuu, Finland, by the group of 
professor Juha Rouvinen (see more details in the publication III).  
36 2.4 Biochemical characterizati on of laccases (I, II, V) 
The molecular weights of purified laccases were determined with SDS-PAGE (I, 
II) and MALDI-TOF (V). The isoelectric points were determined by isoelectric focusing using active staining with ABTS (I, II, V). Enzyme stabilities were determined at different pH-values and temperatures (I, II, V) and pH optima 
were determined in McIlvaine universal buffer over a pH range of 2.28.0 with 
ABTS (I, II, V), guaiacol (I, II, V), 2,6-DMP (II) or syringaldazine (II) as 
substrates. The effects of various inhibitors on laccase activity were determined by measuring oxygen consumption during the enzyme reaction with ABTS in the presence of the inhibitor com pounds (II). The UV-visible spectrum of 
purified native M. albomyces  laccase was measured with a Hitachi U-2000 
spectrophotometer and the EPR spectrum with a Bruker ESP 300 X-band spectrometer (II). The redox-potentials of  the T1 coppers of laccases were 
determined by photometric copper titration in 0.1 M KH
2PO 4 (pH 6.0) as 
described by Xu et al. (1996) using the redox titrant couple K
3Fe(CN) 6/K4Fe(CN) 6. 
2.5 Cloning of the M. albomyces lac1  gene (IV) 
DNA and RNA manipulations were performed according to standard methods 
(Sambrook et al. 1989). A genomic library of M. albomyces  was constructed into 
SuperCos I cosmid, and approximately 5 x 105 clones from the library were 
hybridized with the Podospora anserina lac2  gene encoding laccase II (Fernández-
Larrea and Stahl 1996). Six strongly hybrid ising cosmid clones were isolated, and a 
4.5-kb EcoRI fragment that hybridised with Podospora anserina lac2  was 
subcloned from the cosmids. M. albomyces lac1  gene was sequenced from the insert 
by using the primer walking technique. The cDNA encoding the laccase was cloned 
using RACE-PCR (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). Similarities between M. 
albomyces  laccase protein sequence and other laccase proteins were searched with 
BLAST program at http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BottomBLAST.html.  
37 2.6 Heterologous expression of M. albomyces  laccase in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (IV) 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  strain INVSc1 was transformed with four M. 
albomyces lac1  expression vectors (Table 8) and the corresponding empty 
control vectors using the lithium acetate procedure (Gietz et al. 1992). Production of laccase by the yeast transf ormants was first assayed on plates by 
soaking the well-grown colonies with AB TS and monitoring the formation of 
green color around the colonies. To study laccase production in liquid cultures, the transformants were grown in  SC-Ura medium (Sherman 1991), 
supplemented with 2% glucose (transfo rmants with pLLK7) or 2% raffinose 
(transformants carrying pLLK10, pMS174 or pMS175) and 0.5 mM CuSO
4. 
After two days of cultivation at 30ºC (250 rpm), cells from transformants carrying pLLK10, pMS174 or pMS175 were transferred into induction medium (containing galactose instead of raffino se). Extracellular laccase activity was 
monitored daily using ABTS as substrate. In addition, the presence of extra- and 
intracellular laccase was studied with W estern blotting using polyclonal rabbit 
antibodies raised against purified M. albomyces  laccase. 
2.7 Transformation of Trichoderma reesei  and 
characterization of th e transformants (V) 
M. albomyces  laccase was produced in Trichoderma reesei from two expression 
constructs, both containing the cbh1 promoter and term inator sequences. 
pLLK13 contained the full-length laccase cDNA, whereas pLLK12 contained the T. reesei hydrophobin gene hfb1 (Nakari-Setälä et al. 1996) fused to the 5-
end of the lac1 cDNA region encoding the mature laccase. T. reesei  RutC-30 
was transformed with pLLK13, which also contained the E. coli  hygromycin 
resistance gene, using the procedure described in Penttilä et al. (1987). As pLLK12 did not contain a hygromycin resistance gene, its laccase expression 
cassette was cotransformed with pBluekan7-1.NotI, carrying a hygromycin resistance cassette. The transformants were plated on minimal medium (Penttilä 
et al. 1987) containing glucose and hygr omycin, and well-growing transformants 
were purified to uninuclear clones.  
38 Laccase production was tested on plates containing minimal medium, lactose 
and hygromycin by pipetting ABTS onto fungal colonies and monitoring the formation of green color for two hours. Selected laccase-positive transformants were cultivated in shake flasks in mi nimal medium (Penttilä et al. 1987) 
supplemented with 40 g l
-1 lactose, 20 g l-1 spent grain, 0.1 mM CuSO 4, and 10 g 
l-1 potassium hydrogen phthalate for buffering to pH 6. For monitoring the 
growth properties of the fungi, selected transformants were also grown in a 
soluble medium in which the spent grain was replaced by 2 g l-1 peptone. All the 
cultivations were performed at 28 °C and 200 rpm and production of extracellular 
laccase was monitored with activity measu rements. The intra- and extracellular 
laccase levels were compared by Western blotting. 
Hybridization of the electrophoresed T. reesei  total RNA with M. albomyces  
lac1 cDNA was used to study the M. albomyces  lac1 expression levels from 
different constructs. In addition, the possible induction of the unfolded protein 
response (UPR) pathway was studied by hybridizing the T. reesei  total RNA 
with the specific nucleotide probes genera ted for the transcripts of the following 
T. reesei  genes: pdi1 encoding protein disulphide isomerase (Saloheimo et al. 
1999), bip1 encoding the major ER chaperone (Pakula et al. 2003) and hac1  
encoding the transcription factor of unfolded protein response (Saloheimo et al. 2003).  
2.8 Production and purification of recombinant  
M. albomyces  laccase (V) 
The T. reesei  transformant which produced th e highest laccase activities in shake 
flasks was cultivated in a fermentor in batch and fed-batch modes. The working volume was 20 liters, pH was adjusted  to 5.56, agitation was 400500 rpm, 
aeration was 210 liters min
-1 and the cultivation temperature was 28 °C. The dry 
weight, lactose and total protein concentration, as well as laccase, cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) (Baile y and Tähtiharju 2003) and β-1,4-
endoglucanase activities (IUPAC 1987) were measured daily. In the fed-batch cultivation, lactose feed was controlled by  an algorithm which calculated the rate 
of base addition required for pH control (Bailey and Tähtiharju 2003). Decrease 
in the rate of base addition indicated slower growth and resulted in increased 
lactose feeding.  
39 Recombinant M. albomyces  laccase was purified from the culture supernatant of 
the batch fermentation. The supernatant w as first clarified by bentonite treatment 
and the clear solution was  treated with  papain in order to facilitate the 
separation of recombinant M. albomyces  laccase from the major extracellular 
protein CBHI. After papain digestion the laccase was purified from the solution with three chromatographic steps at room temperature (Table 5).

2.9 Cellulose binding studies (VI) 
The following enzymes were used in experiments studying binding of laccases 
to cellulose: native and recombinant M. albomyces  laccases, Trametes hirsuta  
laccase (purified according to Rittstieg et al. 2002) and Mauginiella  sp. laccase 
(purified according to Palonen et al. 2003). Various amounts of the laccases were incubated in 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 5) in suspensions of steam-pretreated softwood (SPS) (Palonen and Viikari 2004), Avicel (plant-derived microcrystalline cellulose), bacterial mi crocrystalline cellulose (BMCC) (Gilkes 
et al. 1992) or alkali lignin (Indulin AT, Sigma). With BMCC suspensions, 0.5% of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to the buffer in order to reduce non-specific adsorption of the laccase at low protein concentrations. After gentle mixing in an end-over-end rotary shaker for one hour (with lignin at 4 °C and 
with the other matrices at 22 °C), the samples were centrifuged and the residual 
laccase activity in the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically using 
ABTS as substrate. The amount of bound laccase was calculated from the  
40 difference between initial and free enzy me concentrations. The activity of 
cellulose-bound laccase was measured with an end-point activity assay after 
binding to Avicel. 
The reversibility of binding was dete rmined by dilution experiments. M. 
albomyces  laccase was first allowed to adsorb on BMCC. Subsequently, the 
mixture was diluted five-fold with the sample buffer, and the formation of a new equilibrium was monitored by removing small samples from the mixture at different time points and measuring the free laccase activity. The effect of non-specific adsorption on binding to BMCC was studied by omitting BSA from the BMCC suspension. The role of ionic inter actions in adsorptio n was analyzed by 
adding 0.1 or 0.5 M Na
2SO 4 to the reaction mixture.  
41 3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Screening for laccases (I) 
In order to find novel laccases with potentia l for industrial applications and for 
structure-function studies, laccase-produci ng fungi were isolated from various 
environmental samples taken in Finland, as well as from samples taken in a Portuguese cork factory and a Russian pulp mill. Production of ligninolytic enzymes was detected on solid media containing indicator compounds. The screening resulted in isolation of a total of  26 positive fungal strains, of which 15 
were identified by the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (Baarn, The Netherlands; Table 6).

42 The isolated fungal strains represented nine  different genera. Interestingly, four 
strains from the genera Peniophora , Rhizopus or Mucor , which have not hitherto 
been reported to produce ligninolytic enzymes, were found in the screening. In addition, three clearly positive isolates were identified as Trichoderma 
atroviride  or Trichoderma harzianum . Indications of the presence of laccases in 
Trichoderma  spp. have previously been reported by Flegel et al. (1982) and 
Assavanig et al. (1992). In addition, Hö lker et al. (2002) recently discovered 
cell-wall associated laccases in conidia of T. atroviride  and T. harzianum . 
However, none of these Trichoderma  laccases have been characterized with 
respect to their substrates, copper content or amino acid sequence. The production of native laccases by Trichoderma  species is very interesting, 
because T. reesei  secretes very high amounts of both native and recombinant 
cellulases and is currently used fo r production of industrial enzymes. 
The isolated fungal strains that were po sitive in the plate-te st screening were 
cultivated in liquid media. Various combin ations of different nitrogen and carbon 
sources were used, as well as compounds that  have been reported to be inducers of 
laccase production. Extracellular laccas e production was detected in shake flask 
cultures with nine of the 26 strains test ed. Most strains produced very low laccase 
activity levels (below 1 nkat ml
-1), but four fungal strains, LLP12, LLP13, LLP17 
and AH2, produced significant am ounts of laccase (2240 nkat ml-1). No 
extracellular laccase production w as observed with the isolated Trichoderma  strains. 
The identification results of LLP12, LLP17 and AH2 are shown in Table 6, whereas LLP13 was an unidentifiable haploid ba sidiomycete. Laccase production with 
these strains was very dependent on cu lture medium, and the highest laccase 
production was only dete cted in very rich media containing soya meal. Laccase 
production by fungi has previously b een shown to depend markedly on the 
composition of the cultivation medium; for example carbon source, nitrogen content and phenolic inducer compounds ha ve been reported to have significant 
effects on laccase producti on (Niku-Paavola et al. 1990;  Rogalski et al. 1991; 
Schlosser et al. 1997). In this study, n itrogen-containing compounds derived from 
the soya meal might have been the crucia l factor for efficient laccase production. 
Induction of laccase production by high medium nitrogen content has recently 
been detected in the Basidiomycete I-6 2 (CECT 20197) (Mansur et al. 1998), in 
Pleurotus sajor-caju  (Soden and Dobson 2001) and in Trametes trogii  (Colao et 
al. 2003). It is also possible that the so ya meal contained plant-derived phenolic 
compounds that might have induced laccase production.  
43 The laccases produced by LLP12, LLP13,  and AH2 were characterized with 
regard to molecular weight, isoelectric point (pI), pH optimum and thermostability. The laccases from LLP13 and AH2 were purified and 
characterized in this study and LLP 12 laccase was characterized by Niku-
Paavola et al. (2004). In addition, the properties of LLP17 laccase were studied from the culture filtrate. The results s howed that the sizes, pI values and pH 
optima of these novel laccases were typical  for basidiomycete laccases (Table 2, 
Table 7). In addition, the peptide sequen ces of the N-terminus and two internal 
peptides of AH2 ( Pholiota  sp.) laccase were determined. AH2 laccase was 
shown to be highly homologo us to other basidiomycete laccases, such as 
Trametes trogii  Lcc1 (Colao et al. 2003), Trametes villosa  Lcc4 (Yaver and 
Golightly 1996), Trametes versicolor  Lcc1 (Jönsson et al. 1995), Pycnoporus 
cinnabarinus  LAC1 (Eggert et al. 1998) and Phlebia radiata  laccase (Saloheimo 
et al. 1991). The exceptional feature of the novel laccases found in this screening was their relatively high thermostability in citrate buffer at pH 6. The half-lives 
at 60
oC were 36 h (Table 7), whereas many fungal laccases have clearly shorter 
half-lives at this temperature (Heinzkill et al. 1998; Schneider et al. 1999; Tagger et al. 1998; Palonen et al. 2003). These results were very promising for 
future studies on the novel laccases, becau se thermostability is one of the key 
factors determining the applicability of an enzyme for industrial use.

44 Plate-test screening with laccase indi cator compounds has been reported by 
many groups (Nishida et al. 1988; de Jong et al. 1992; Barbosa et al. 1996; 
Goncalves and Steiner 1996; Chefetz et al. 1998; Raghukumar et al. 1999), but most of the laccases found in these screening studies have not been purified or characterized. However, Goncalves and Steiner (1996) and Chefetz et al. (1998) reported the enzymatic characteristic s of the isolated novel laccases from 
Polyporus  sp. and Chaetomium thermophilum , respectively. The Polyporus  sp. 
laccase was a typical basidiomycete lacca se with respect to its catalytical 
properties (Goncalves and Steiner 1996), whereas laccase from the thermophilic ascomycete Chaetomium thermophilum  was shown to be exceptionally 
thermostable and to have a pH optimum for syringaldazine oxidation at pH 6 (Chefetz et al. 1998). In addition, the use of indicator plates facilitated isolation 
of the basidiomycete fungus Flavodon flavus  strain 312, which has potential in 
bioremediation (Raghukumar et al. 1999).  These results support our conclusion 
that indicator plates are an efficient and simple method for discovering novel laccases for both research and industrial application purposes. 
3.2 Purification and biochemi cal characterization of 
Melanocarpus albomyces  laccase (II) 
Earlier studies conducted at VTT Biotechnology had indicated that the 
thermophilic ascomycete Melanocarpus albomyces  produced laccases (Ravanko 
1996). Because M. albomyces  has previously been reported to produce 
thermostable and neutral cellulases and xylanases (Vehmaanperä et al. 1996; Prabhu and Maheshwari 1999; Jain et al. 1998), laccase production by M. 
albomyces was studied in more detail in this work. M. albomyces  laccase was 
purified by three chromatographic step s: anion exchange chromatography, 
hydrophobic interaction chromatography  and gel filtration and the purified 
enzyme was biochemically characterized. It showed a molecular mass of 80 kDa on SDS-PAGE, which is slightly higher than the values determined for most fungal laccases (Table 2). Unlike many fungi that often produce several laccase isoforms (Table 7; Bourbonnais et al. 1995; Yaver et al. 1996; Palmieri et al. 
2000; Palonen et al. 2003), M. albomyces  produced only one laccase isoform 
with a pI of 4.0 in the selected cultu re conditions. The UV-VIS and EPR spectra 
of M. albomyces  laccase were typical for blue copper proteins, indicating the 
presence of the type-1, -2 and -3 copper atoms.  
45 In addition to the spectral data, the purifie d enzyme was verified to be a laccase 
by substrate and inhibitor studies. M. albomyces  laccase was able to oxidize the 
typical laccase substrates ABTS, syringaldazine, 2,6-DMP and guaiacol, and it did not oxidize tyrosine. The known laccase inhibitors KCN, NaN
3 and NaF 
efficiently inhibited M. albomyces  laccase activity. The N-terminal and two 
internal peptide sequences of M. albomyces  laccase were also determined and 
compared with those of other fungal laccases. The closest homology was found with other ascomycete laccases from Myceliophthora thermophila  (Berka et al. 
1997a), Podospora anserina  (Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996) and  Neurospora 
crassa  (Germann et al. 1988). 
The activity and stability of purified M. albomyces  laccase were determined at 
different pH values and temperatures. Th e pH optimum was measured with four 
different substrates, and the lowest pH optimum, 3.5, was determined in oxidizing ABTS, similarly to other fungal laccases (Figure 3A; Robles et al. 2000; Xu 1997). However, oxidation of guaiacol and syringaldazine by M. 
albomyces  laccase showed a pH optimum in the neutral pH range (Figure 3A). 
Dependence of pH optima on the substrat e has also been observed with other 
laccases and it has been proposed to reflect the difference in oxidation mechanisms between phenolic and non-phe nolic substrates (see Introduction; 
Hoffmann and Esser 1977; Palmieri et al. 1993; Eggert et al. 1996b; Xu 1997; Chefetz et al. 1998; Schneider et al. 1999). Compared to other laccases, the exceptional property of M. albomyces  laccase was its activity at alkaline pH 
values; the enzyme still showed 75% of  its maximum activity at pH 8 with 
guaiacol. Most fungal laccases have pH optima around 46 when measured with phenolic substrates and they rapidly lose ac tivity when the pH is increased above 
6 (Hoffmann and Esser 1977; Palmieri et al. 1993; Eggert et al. 1996b; Xu 1997; 
Chefetz et al. 1998; Schneider et al. 1999). The stability of M. albomyces  laccase 
was also good at neutral or slightly alkaline pH values, which is common for other laccases as well (Nishizawa et al. 1995; Xu et al. 1996; Chefetz et al. 1998).

purified M. albomyces  laccase measured with guaiacol at pH 6 at 40 ( •), 50 (■), 
60 (▲), and 70ºC (×).  
In addition to high activity and stability at elevated pH values, M. albomyces  
laccase was shown to have good thermostab ility at 40, 50 and 60°C (Figure 3B). 
Its activity remained virtually unaltere d for 24 hours at 40 and 50°C and for two 
hours at 60°C. In addition, thermal activ ation at 50°C was observed, which has  
47 previously been detected with laccases from Myceliophthora thermophila  and 
Scytalidium thermophilum  (Xu et al. 1996). Combination of thermostability and 
activity at neutral to alkaline pH values  is very rare among fungal laccases, as 
many other laccases with a pH optimum around 67 are not thermostable. For example, unusually high pH optima (78)  have been measured with 2,6-
dimethoxyphenol for laccases from Coprinus friesii , Panaeolus papilionaceus  
and Panaeolus sphinctrinus , but the enzymes rapidly lose activity at 60
oC 
(Heinzkill et al. 1998). However, an excep tionally thermostable bacterial laccase 
(CotA) was recently isolated from Bacillus subtilis , and this laccase also has an 
optimum at pH 7 when measured with syringaldazine (Martins et al. 2002). The crystal structure of CotA has been solv ed at 2.4 Å resolution, and the authors 
suggested that the high thermostability of CotA is related to its function as an 
endospore coat component (Enguita et al. 2003). Interestingly, the structure indicated tight internal packing of the protein, which is required for its assembly into the spore coat, and this packing might confer improved thermostablity to the quaternary structure (Enguita et al. 2003). Since M. albomyces  also produces 
thermostable cellulases and xylanases, the role of the laccase may be related to 
degradation of lignocellulosic material in the naturally warm habitat of the 
fungus, tropical soil. Laccase could also  be related to spore formation or 
pigmentation, because M. albomyces  forms melanized ascomata after prolonged 
cultivation, as indicated by the name Melanocarpus . Several laccases have been 
shown to be involved in melanization r eactions (Eggert et al. 1995; Williamson 
et al. 1998; Edens et al. 1999; Martins et al. 2002), but the exact role of laccase in M. albomyces  is not known.  
3.3 Crystal structure of M. albomyces  laccase (III) 
Determination of crystal structures of laccases is complicated by their high 
degree of glycosylation, difficulties in  achieving efficient expression, and the 
presence of multiple laccase isoforms in several laccase-producing fungi. For several years, only one laccase structure was available, for Lcc1 of Coprinus 
cinereus  (Ducros et al. 1998). Unfortunately, it was not complete because it 
lacked the T2 copper. The three-dimensional structure of M. albomyces  laccase 
containing all four copper atoms was solved by x-ray crystallography at 2.4 Å resolution at the University of Joensuu. The overall structure was shown to consist of three cupredoxin-like domains (Figure 1), in accordance with the  
48 structures of Coprinus cinereus  Lcc1 (Ducros et al. 1998) and other blue copper 
oxidases (Messerschmidt et al. 1992; Zaitseva et al. 1996). A similar fold has also recently been published for laccases from Trametes versicolor  (Bertrand et 
al. 2002; Piontek et al. 2002) and Bacillus subtilis  (Enguita et al. 2003). 
All the characteristic four copper atoms were found in the M. albomyces  laccase 
structure. The T1 copper was trigonally  coordinated to two histidines and a 
cysteine residue, and the distant axia l ligand was a non-coordinating leucine 
residue. Both of the T3 coppers were c oordinated to three histidines and the T2 
copper was shown to be coordinated to two histidines and a chloride ion. The 
coordination bonds between the coppers a nd the amino acids are well conserved 
in multicopper oxidases, and they have also been observed in Trametes 
versicolor  (Bertrand et al. 2002; Piontek et al. 2002) and Bacillus subtilis  
laccases (Enguita et al. 2003), as well as in ascorbate oxidase from zucchini 
(Messerschmidt et al. 1992). The only exception is the axial ligand of T1, which is a non-coordinating leucine in M. albomyces  laccase and Coprinus cinereus  
Lcc1 (Ducros et al. 1998) and a phenylalanine in Trametes versicolor  laccases 
(Bertrand et al. 2002; Piontek et al. 2002), but a coordinating methionine in ascorbate oxidase (Messerschmidt et al. 1992) and Bacillus subtilis  CotA 
(Enguita et al. 2003). The coordinating pr opensity of the axial ligand has been 
suggested to be important in determ ining the redox-potential of multicopper 
oxidases, but recent results have also em phasized the role of other bonds around 
the T1 copper (see Introduction). 
The crystal structure of M. albomyces  laccase showed two exceptional features 
as compared to other multicopper oxidase structures. First, elongated electron density was detected in the trinuclear center, indicating the presence of a molecular oxygen molecule in the middle of the T3 copper pair. This kind of binding geometry has not previously been observed at a trinuclear copper site. However, a dioxygen molecule was recen tly detected in the solvent channel 
directed towards the trinuclear center in  the crystal structure of CotA adducted 
with ABTS, and the authors suggested that the dioxygen is caught in a holding position prior to binding to the copper atoms (Enguita et al. 2004). The second exceptional feature in the M. albomyces  laccase structure was its C-terminus, 
which packed inside a tunnel leading to the trinuclear center. The C-terminal 
carboxylate group was also shown to form a hydrogen bond to a side chain of His140, which coordinates one of the T3  coppers. In the other reported laccase  
49 structures, the tunnel is not blocked, and it has been proposed to provide access 
for the solvent molecules to the tri nuclear site (Messerschmidt et al. 1992; 
Bertrand et al. 2002; Piontek et al. 2002). If the tunnel actually forms the access route for oxygen or the exit route for water molecules, the C-terminal plug might be one reason for the presence of the oxygen molecule in the active site of the crystallized M. albomyces  laccase. 
3.4 Cloning of the M. albomyces lac1  gene (IV) 
The N-terminal and two internal peptide sequences determined from purified M. 
albomyces  laccase showed high homology to Podospora anserina  laccase 2 (II). 
Therefore, Podospora anserina  lac2 gene (Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996) 
was used as a heterologous hybridization pr obe in isolation of the gene encoding 
M. albomyces  laccase. Screening of an M. albomyces  genomic DNA library with 
Podospora anserina  lac2 resulted in isolation of a 4.5-kb DNA fragment, and 
the laccase-encoding region of the frag ment was sequenced by the primer 
walking method. The amino acid sequence deduced from the isolated gene was shown to contain the conserved copper-bi nding motifs typical for laccases. All 
the three peptide sequences obtained previously from purified M. albomyces 
laccase could also be identified in the amino acid sequence, which verified that 
the gene encoded the biochemically characterized M. albomyces  laccase enzyme. 
M. albomyces  lac1 gene codes for a protein of 623 amino acids corresponding to 
one of the largest fungal laccases describ ed so far (Table 2). The corresponding 
lac1 cDNA was cloned by RACE-PCR and its sequence revealed the presence of 
five introns in the genomic laccase gene. When compared to Myceliophthora 
thermophila lcc1  gene (Berka et al. 1997a), all the five introns in M. albomyces 
lac1 were located in conserved positions. The single intron in the Neurospora 
crassa  laccase gene (Germann et al. 1988) and introns I and II in Podospora 
anserina  lac2 (Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996) also aligned with M. 
albomyces lac1  introns. These results are in acco rdance with previous results 
showing conserved intron architectures  among laccase genes from the same 
fungal phylum (Saloheimo et al. 1991; Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996; Berka 
et al. 1997b). The overall amino acid identity of M. albomyces laccase was also 
high with other ascomycete laccases. The level of amino acid identity was 73% with Myceliophthora thermophila  laccase (Berka et al. 1997a), 68% with  
50 Podospora anserina  laccase 2 (Fernández -Larrea and Stahl 1996), and 63% with 
Neurospora crassa  laccase (Germann et al. 1988 ). On the other hand, the 
similarity with basidiomycete laccases wa s only about 30%, which complies with 
the hypothesis of the separation of fung al laccases into two divergent groups. 
The first 22 N-terminal amino acids of M. albomyces  laccase consisted of a 
predicted signal sequence typical for eukary otic proteins (Nielsen et al. 1997). 
Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the N-terminal peptide sequence of the purified protein showed that the signal sequence was followed 
by a cleavable propeptide of 28 amino acids. Furthermore, M. albomyces  laccase 
was shown to be processed at its C-te rminus: C-terminal sequencing of the 
purified laccase identified Ser-Gly-Leu as the last three amino acids, which indicated that the last 14 predicted amino acid residues were absent from the 
mature protein. Similar processing has al so been suggested for other ascomycete 
laccases, namely Neurospora crassa  (Germann et al. 1988), Podospora anserina  
(Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996) and Myceliophthora thermophila (Berka et 
al. 1997b) laccases. The last four amino acids of these mature proteins are also Asp-Ser-Gly-Leu. Interestingly, the se quence Asp-Ser-Gly-(Leu/Ile/Val) also 
exists in the C-termini of laccases from the ascomycetes Cryphonectria 
parasitica  (Choi et al. 1992), Botrytis cinerea  (Cantone and Staples 1993), 
Glomerella (Colletotrichum) lagenarium  (Tsuji et al. 2001) and 
Gaeumannomyces graminis  var. tritici  (Litvintseva and Henson 2002), although 
in these laccases the conserved tetrapeptides are the last amino acid residues of the open reading frames and are not followe d by cleavable extensions. This kind 
of conservation of C-terminal ends, al ong with the presence of the C-terminal 
plug in the crystal structure of M. albomyces  laccase, strongly suggests that the 
conserved C-terminus has an important role in the function of ascomycete laccases. No similar conservation has been found among basidiomycete laccases. 
3.5 Heterologous expression of M. albomyces  laccase in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (IV) 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  is often used as a host organism for production of 
heterologous eukaryotic proteins because of its easy handling in the laboratory, 
the broad knowledge of its molecular biology as well as the availability of 
versatile tools for its genetic e ngineering. Another benefit of S. cerevisiae  is that  
51 it does not secrete high amounts of contaminating native proteins into the culture 
medium. In this study, S. cerevisiae  was used as a heterologous production host 
for M. albomyces  laccase in order to create a relatively simple laccase expression 
system for directed evolution studies to be conducted in the future. Four different expression vectors with different types of promoters, signal sequences and propeptides as well as modified laccase cDNAs were constructed (Table 8).

Laccase production was not detected from pLLK7, which contained the 
constitutive PGK1  promoter, and very low laccase activity was detected from 
pLLK10, which contained the galactose-inducible GAL1  promoter and the native 
laccase prepro sequence (Table 8). The most prominent improvement in laccase production was achieved by replacing th e signal and propeptide sequences of 
lac1 with the yeast α-factor signal sequence and propeptide (plasmid pMS174). 
This substitution improved extracellular l accase activity levels about 200-fold 
(Table 8). When the cleavable C-termin al extension of the laccase was removed 
by introducing a stop codon after the native cleavage site (i.e. pMS175), laccase production was further improved about six-fold (Table 8). If the enzyme produced in yeast has the same specific activity as the native M. albomyces  
52 laccase, the highest laccase production level in yeast should correspond to about 
3 mg l-1. This is well adequate for high throughput screening of directed 
evolution experiments. 
The prepro sequence of the MFα1 gene of S. cerevisiae  has been used as a 
secretion signal in different yeast expression systems, including Hansenula 
polymorpha , Kluyveromyces lactis , Pichia pastoris  and S. cerevisiae  as host 
organisms (Weydemann et al. 1995; Jön sson et al. 1997; Hsieh and Da Silva 
1998; Otterbein et al. 2000; Brown et al. 2002; Soden et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2003). It has also been used in basidiomycete laccase production in Pichia 
pastoris , but contrary to our results, these studies did not show higher laccase 
production levels with α-factor prepro sequence compared to native laccase 
signal sequences (Jönsson et al. 1997; Otte rbein et al. 2000; Brown et al. 2002; 
Soden et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2003). Howeve r, it must be taken into account that 
our results were obtained with S. cerevisiae , which may recognize and process 
its own native prepro sequence more efficiently than P. pastoris . In addition, 
none of the laccases expressed in P. pastoris  contained cleavable propeptide 
regions similar to that of M. albomyces laccase. It is possible that the propeptide 
cleavage of M. albomyces  laccase was a major problematic step for the 
production of this enzyme in S. cerevisiae , and the significant improvement in 
laccase production brought about by the α-factor prepro sequence resulted from 
improved processing and secretion of the mature laccase protein. The importance of correct proteolytic processing for laccase expression was also verified by further improved laccase activity levels when the region encoding the cleavable C-terminal extension was rem oved. Improper folding of the product of 
the intact lac1 cDNA was also suggested by Western blotting of yeast cell lysate 
samples, as the laccase with the C-terminal  extension (pMS174) appeared to be 
more degraded intracellularly than the product of the truncated laccase gene 
(pMS175). 
Interestingly, expression of the closely homologous Myceliophthora thermophila  
laccase in S. cerevisiae  was also recently reported (Bulter et al. 2003). The initial 
production level was very low, but the production was considerably improved by 
directed evolution of the laccase gene, and a rather high laccase production level, 18 mg l
-1, was eventually reached (Bulter et al. 2003). The results of Bulter 
et al. (2003) also highlighted the importance of correct proteolytic processing of the preproenzyme, because three of the 13 amino acid substitutions found in the  
53 best-produced mutant laccase were locat ed at the three processing sites of the 
preproenzyme. Bulter et al. (2003) also studied the role of the C-terminal extension in laccase production by inserting a stop codon after the C-terminal processing site. In contrast to our results, removal of the C-terminal extension led to decreased laccase production (Bu lter et al. 2003). However, the point 
mutation was made in Myceliophthora thermophila lcc1  altered by a series of 
random mutations, and these random mutati ons may have affected the observed 
production levels. Despite this discrepancy, the results for Myceliophthora 
thermophila laccase mutants supported our conclusion that correct processing 
and folding is essential for production of these ascomycete laccases in yeast. 
3.6 Transformation of Trichoderma reesei  with  
M. albomyces lac1  and characterization  
of the transformants (V) 
M. albomyces  produced laccase in rather low amounts (max 20 mg l-1) and the 
cultivations were difficult to reproduce. The yields from expression of  M. 
albomyces lac1 cDNA in S. cerevisiae  were adequate for directed evolution 
purposes but not high enough for efficient laccase production. Therefore M. 
albomyces laccase was expressed in Trichoderma reesei , a well-known 
filamentous fungus capable of prod ucing high amounts of extracellular 
hydrolytic enzymes (Mäntylä et al. 1998). M. albomyces lac1 cDNA was placed 
under the strongly inducible promoter of the major cellulase gene cbh1 , which 
has previously been used for production of e.g. Phlebia radiata  laccase 
(Saloheimo and Niku-Paavola 1991). 
M. albomyces  laccase was expressed in T. reesei  in two forms: as a non-fused 
laccase and as a fusion protein containing the T. reesei  hydrophobin I (HFBI) 
protein at the N-terminus. HFBI was chosen as a fusion partner because fusions with secreted native proteins have been  reported to enhance the production of 
foreign proteins in T. reesei  (Nyyssönen et al. 1993; Paloheimo et al. 2003), and 
also because HFBI can facilitate purifi cation of the recombinant protein in 
aqueous two-phase systems (Linder et al. 2001; Selber et al. 2001). Several 
laccase-positive T. reesei  transformants were obtained from both expression 
constructs. Approximately fivefold activ ity levels were obtained with the non-
fused laccase than with the HFBI-lacca se fusion protein. The highest laccase  
54 activity produced by the non-fusion transformants was 193 nkat ml-1, which 
corresponds to about 230 mg l-1. Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of the culture 
supernatant samples showed that the r ecombinant laccase was one of the major 
secreted proteins of the transformants (Figure 4C). 
Fusion to a secreted host protein had no effect on the production of the 
heterologous M. albomyces  laccase. On the other hand, HFBI has not previously 
been used as a production carrier protein. To examine the secretion of heterologous laccase, transformants from both expression constructs were 
studied by Western blotting. The cell lysate and culture supernatant samples 
showed that most of the HFBI-laccase fusion protein was cleaved between the 
fusion partners (Figures 4A and 4B, lanes 12). Cell lysate samples also showed intracellular proteolytic degradation of bot h the non-fused laccase and the fusion 
protein (Figure 4B, lanes 2 and 4), but for the fusion protein the intracellular proportion was much higher. This suggests that secretion of the fusion protein was a problematic step in the production.  This was further indicated by RNA 
hybridization analyses, which showed that the laccase mRNA levels obtained 
from the fusion construct were at the same level or even higher than those derived from the non-fusion construct (F igure 5). The difference between the 
production level of the two expression constr ucts could thus no t be explained by 
transcription efficiency or mRNA stability.

Overexpression of heterologous proteins often causes secretion stress in host 
cells. This can induce the unfolded protei n response (UPR) pathway, which is a 
signal transduction pathway reacting to accu mulation of unfolded proteins in the 
endoplasmic reticulumn (ER) and induc ing genes involved in folding,  
56 degradation or transport of proteins (Mori 2003). The possible induction of UPR 
by laccase expression in T. reesei  was studied by hybridizing T. reesei  total 
RNA with the cDNA-probes of the UPR-related genes pdi1, bip1  and hac1 . The 
results showed that pdi1 and bip1 mRNAs were not present at elevated levels as 
compared to the control, and the truncated form of the hac1 mRNA was not 
found in any of the laccase-producing tran sformants (Figure 5). This indicated 
that laccase production did not cause severe secretion stress in T. reesei . The 
result was slightly surprising, since ra ther extensive intracellular accumulation 
of the fusion protein and its degradatio n products was detected by the Western 
blot analyses with the antibody against M. albomyces  laccase (Figure 4B). This 
might be explained by trapping of the fusion protein in other parts of the secretory pathway than the ER, e.g. in the vacuole.

RNA with M. albomyces lac1  and the UPR-related cDNA-probes  pdi1, bip1  and hac1 
after 4, 5 and 7 days of cultivation. The signal intensities were quantified and 
normalized to gpd1  (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) signal.  
57 3.7 Production, purification and biochemical 
characterization of recombinant M. albomyces  laccase 
from T. reesei  (V) 
In order to produce high amounts of M. albomyces  laccase, the T. reesei  
transformant producing highest laccase activities was cultivated in a laboratory-
scale fermentor. Two types of cultivations were performed, a batch and a fed-batch fermentation. In the batch ferm entation, the highest laccase activity 
reached 250 nkat ml
-1, which corresponds to about 290 mg l-1 of laccase. 
Significant improvement in the production level was achieved by applying the recently published feeding algorithm fo r continuous cellulase production by T. 
reesei  (Bailey and Tähtiharju 2003). When lactose was slowly added into the 
cultivation medium after exhaustion of the initial carbon source, the laccase activity increased to 780 nkat ml
-1, corresponding to about 920 mg l-1. The 
achieved production level is comparable to the highest reported laccase production levels of 7001500 mg l
-1 obtained in the native hosts Trametes 
pubescens  and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  (Galhaup et al. 2002b; Lomascolo et al. 
2003). M. albomyces  laccase production in the cultivations was rather 
interesting, as it occurred at a different  growth phase than cellulase production, 
although the laccase gene was expressed from the cbh1  promoter. The 
production curves for cellulases were typical for T. reesei , and the most efficient 
cellulase production occurred at the time when exhaustion of lactose started to limit fungal growth (Bailey and Tähtihar ju 2003). However, laccase activity in 
the culture supernatant increased signi ficantly after cellulase production and 
fungal growth had already ended. This might be related to activation of an 
apolaccase by proteolytic processing of the propeptide and/or the C-terminal extension rather than actual protein pr oduction. As determined by N- and C-
terminal sequencing of purified recombinant laccase, T. reesei  was able to 
process both termini of the laccase correc tly. Involvement of proteolysis in the 
activation of laccases has previously been detected with a Pleurotus ostreatus  
laccase (Palmieri et al. 2001). Another possibility for the continuously increasing laccase activity in the supernat ant could have been the release of 
intracellular laccase after cell autolysis. 
Recombinant laccase was purified from the fermentation culture filtrate. The 
purification was significantly disturbed by the presence of high amounts of the major cellulase CBHI, because laccase and intact CBHI could not be separated  
58 by the chromatographic methods available. However, purification of laccase 
succeeded after treating the culture supe rnatant with papain, which cleaved 
CBHI between the cellulose binding domain and the core protein (van Tilbeurgh et al. 1986). The cleavage altered the hydrophobicity of CBHI and thus facilitated the separation of laccase and CBHI by hydrophobic interaction 
chromatography. Papain digestion did not change the activity, size, N- or C-terminal peptide sequences of M. albomyces  laccase. After hydrophobic 
interaction chromatography, the laccase w as further purified by anion exchange 
chromatography and gel filtration. Purifi ed recombinant laccase and wild type 
M. albomyces  laccase were compared with regard to molecular weights, 
isoelectric points, pH optima, thermo stabilities, redox-potentials and kinetic 
constants. The results showed that  recombinant laccase produced in T. reesei  
was very similar to the wild type laccase (Table 9) 
Table 9. Biochemical characteristics of native (MaL) and recombinant (rMaL)

succinate buffer at pH 4.5 with ABTS and in 40 mM MES/NaOH buffer at pH 6 with other substrates.

59 When compared to other laccases, M. albomyces  laccase had a rather high Km 
value for the non-phenolic ABTS and very low Km values for the phenolic 2,6-
DMP and syringaldazine (Tables 1 and 9). This indicates that phenolic 
compounds might be better substrates for M. albomyces  laccase than the 
commonly used ABTS. The catalytic constant values of M. albomyces  laccase 
are closest to the values of Myceliophthora thermophila  laccase (Table 1; Bulter 
et al. 2003), which can be explained by the high similarity between the amino-
acid sequences of the enzymes. 
3.8 Binding of M. albomyces  laccase to ce llulose (VI) 
During the purification of recombinant M. albomyces laccase, it was discovered 
that the laccase adsorbed on cellulosic materials. This phenomenon was studied 
in more detail using steam-pretreated softwood (SPS), microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose, BMCC) and alkali lignin as adsorbents. In addition, the binding of Trametes hirsuta  and Mauginiella  sp. 
laccases was studied in order to compare the behaviours of different laccases. 
Binding to SPS was studied using the three different laccases at two 
concentrations. The results showed that only M. albomyces  laccase showed 
extensive binding, whereas Trametes hirsuta and Mauginiella  sp. laccases did 
not adsorb on softwood. This suggested that binding to lignocellulosic materials is not a common feature of all laccases. Binding of M. albomyces  laccase was 
further studied with purified microcrystalline cellulose. The adsorption studies with Avicel showed that less than 3% of the initial activity remained in the 
supernatant after one hour of binding, i.e. M. albomyces  laccase was able to bind 
very efficiently to pure cellulose (Table 10A). To verify that the disappearance 
of laccase activity from the supernatant was not caused by inactivation of the laccase by cellulose, the activity of  bound laccase was also measured. The 
results showed that all the enzyme activity removed from the supernatant could be recovered by measuring the activity of enzyme bound to cellulose (Table 10A). This confirmed that the activity me asurement data desc ribed true binding 
of M. albomyces  laccase to cellulose. 
Lignin is one of the natural substrates of laccases. Therefore, the adsorption of 
M. albomyces  laccase on lignin was also studied. Binding to lignin was studied  
60 at 4°C in order to minimize the possible degr adation of lignin by the laccase. No 
binding to Indulin AT (alkali lignin) o ccurred, and all of the initial activity was 
detected in the supernatant fraction afte r mixing for one hour (Table 10B). This 
is in contrast with the results obtained with many cellulases, which have been shown to adsorb on both cellulose and lignin (Sutcliffe and Saddler, 1986; 
Bernardez et al. 1993; Palonen et al. 2004). However, it must be taken into account that the adsorption of cellulases on lignin strongly depends on the nature 
of the lignin preparation (Palonen et al. 2004), and the extraction and drying of the alkali lignin used in this study may have changed its characteristics 
significantly.

fractions after mixing with 1% Avicel at 22

Due to the rather heterogeneous structure of Avicel preparations, more detailed 
analysis on binding of M. albomyces  to cellulose was performed using bacterial 
microcrystalline cellulose as adso rbent. The amount of laccase bound to 
cellulose was measured using different enzyme concentrations, and the adsorption parameters for M. albomyces  laccase were determined from the 
adsorption isotherm obtained (Figure 6). The data points on the isotherm fitted well to the classical Langmuir-type binding model, which facilitated the calculation of the maximum binding capacity B
max and the dissociation constant  
61 Kd (Bothwell and Walker 1995). The curve fit yielded values of 1.94 ±0.05 µmol 
g-1 and 0.006 ±0.001 µM, respectively. The relative partition coefficient ( Kp) of 
320 ± 80 l g-1 was also calculated by using the slope of the isotherm at low 
enzyme concentration (Linder et al. 1996). As a comparison, the adsorption of Trametes hirsuta  laccase was also studied at two points on the isotherm. The 
results clearly indicated that Trametes hirsuta  laccase did not bind to BMCC 
(Figure 6).

Comparison of the binding parameters of M. albomyces  laccase with the values 
obtained for cellulases showed that  the maximum binding capacity of M. 
albomyces  laccase was relatively low, as bi nding capacities ranging from 6 to 20 
µmol g-1 for BMCC have been reported for various cellulases (Reinikainen et al. 
1995; Jung et al. 2003). However, very similar binding capacity of 2.1 µmol g-1 
has previously been observed for a cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) from 
Phanerochaete chrysosporium  (Henriksson et al. 1997).  Despite the low binding 
capacity, the affinity of M. albomyces  laccase (represented by Kp) was clearly 
higher than those reported for cellulases. For example, the partition coefficients 
of cellobiohydrolases CBHI and CBHII from Trichoderma reesei  were 18 and 
3.4 l g-1, respectively, (Palonen et al. 1999), and those of the cellulases CenA 
and Cex from Cellulomonas fimi  were 40.5 and 33.3 l g-1, respectively (Gilkes et 
al. 1992). The combination of high affinity and low capacity of binding suggests that M. albomyces  laccase is able to bind very strongly to BMCC, but only at 
relatively few binding sites. One probable reason for the differences in binding behaviour between cellulases and M. albomyces  laccase could be the absence of  
62 a cellulose binding domain (CBD) in the laccase. Neither the amino acid 
sequence nor the crystal structure of M. albomyces  laccase contain a separate 
CBD that in most cellulases dominates the binding characteristics. In addition, 
the Phanerochaete chrysosporium  CDH, which shows similar binding behaviour 
to that of M. albomyces  laccase, does not contain a separate CBD either 
(Henriksson et al. 1997; Hallberg et al. 2002). The crystal structure of CDH has been analyzed with respec t to cellulose binding, but no obvious substructures or 
surface patches that could be assigned as th e binding site have been identified 
(Hallberg et al. 2002). 
One of the assumptions in a Langmuir-type binding model is full reversibility of 
adsorption, and the reversibility of binding of M. albomyces  laccase to cellulose 
was studied by dilution experiments. Th e desorption data showed that a new 
equilibrium was established on the same isotherm, which indicated that the 
binding was fully reversible. In order to  elucidate the nature of interactions 
affecting the adsorption of M. albomyces  laccase on BMCC, the effect of non-
specific protein (BSA) and ionic strength on binding were also studied. The results showed that the binding of M. albomyces  laccase to cellulose was not 
affected by BSA. The binding was thus not markedly affected by random protein 
adsorption on cellulose. The binding was al so unaltered in the presence of 0.1
0.5 M Na
2SO 4. As ionic interactions are weakened by increasing ionic strength, 
it can be concluded that electrostatic forces were not the main cause for the 
observed binding (Kyriacou et al. 1988). Interestingly, these binding characteristics of M. albomyces  laccase resemble the binding of CBDs to 
cellulose, despite the lack of a CBD in  the laccase. When CBDs are separated 
from the core of the cellulase protein, they show many binding characteristics 
similar to those of M. albomyces  laccase: the binding is not affected by even 
high concentrations of a non-specific prot ein such as BSA, it is fully reversible, 
and it follows a first order Langmuir isotherm (Linder and Teeri 1996). 
Binding of M. albomyces  laccase to cellulose is very interesting considering the 
role of fungal laccases in nature. Recently, preliminary results by Paice et al. (2002) showed adsorption of Myceliophthora thermophila  laccase on Kraft pulp, 
which suggests that adsorption on ce llulose may be a common feature among 
some laccases. The function of this  phenomenon is unknown, but it could be 
related to the total hydrolys is of lignocellulose, because M. albomyces  is also 
known to produce several cellulose- and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes  
63 (Saraswat and Bisaria 2000; Miettinen-Oinonen et al. 2004). Laccase treatment 
of lignocellulose has been shown to improve the hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulases by about 13% (Palonen and Viikari 2004). Interestingly, the cellulose-binding enzyme CDH uses quinones and phenoxy radicals, i.e. products of laccase-catalyzed reactions, as electron donors when oxidizing cellobiose (Henriksson et al. 2000). It is thus possible that laccase produces electron donors for CDH and that the two enzymes function in close proximity. Total degradation of the chemically resistan t lignocellulose most probably requires the 
concerted action of a wide set of versa tile enzymes, and binding to cellulose may 
assist in increasing the effective concentr ations of these enzymes at the reaction 
site.  
  
64 4. Conclusions 
Laccases are blue copper proteins which catalyze oxidation reactions coupled to 
the four-electron reduction of molecu lar oxygen to water. Because of the 
versatility of potential substrates, l accases are highly interesting as novel 
biocatalysts in various industrial pr ocesses. This work describes screening for 
laccase-producing fungi from various environmental samples and preliminary analysis of the most interesting isol ated enzymes. The work also provides 
detailed biochemical, structural and gene tic information on a novel laccase from 
the thermophilic fungus Melanocarpus albomyces . 
Screening for laccase-producing fungi showed that novel ligninolytic micro-
organisms can be found by simple plate tests using the indicator compounds guaiacol and the polymeric dyes RBBR or Poly R-478. Four novel fungal laccases were characterized and they were found to have high thermostabilities as compared to other fungal laccases studied thus far. 
A novel laccase from  M. albomyces  was purified and biochemically 
characterized with respect to size, pI, substrate specificity, inhibitors, pH and temperature characteristics and the presence of copper atoms. The data indicated that the purified enzyme was a true laccase. The laccase was shown to be rather thermostable and to have unusually high pH optima, which increases its potential for many industrial applications. The crystal structure of M. albomyces  
laccase was resolved as one of the first laccase structures containing all four copper atoms. This facilitated the dete rmination of copper coordination 
chemistry at the laccase active site. Copper-containing enzymes are crucial metabolic catalysts throughout all king doms of life, and their ability to bind 
oxygen has been studied widely. Interestingly, the structure of M. albomyces  
laccase revealed elongated electron density between the three coppers in the trinuclear center, suggesting the prese nce of molecular oxygen bound with a 
novel binding geometry. The crystal structure of M. albomyces  laccase also 
revealed an exceptional C-terminal plug, i.e. the last four amino-acid residues of the protein were packed inside a tunnel leading to the trinuclear copper center. The importance of the C-terminal plug is  not yet understood, but it may have a 
role in the function of the enzyme by affecting the entry of oxygen into the active site.  
65 The gene encoding M. albomyces  laccase was cloned in order to elucidate the 
molecular structure of the enzyme and to produce it heterologously. M. 
albomyces laccase was shown to be similar in amino-acid sequence with 
laccases from other ascomycetous fungi, but significantly less related to basidiomycete laccases. This finding furt her strengthened the hypothesis of the 
separation of fungal laccases into two clearly divergent groups. The N- and C-terminal sequences of the purified laccase showed that both ends of the proenzyme were processed after translation. Conservation of the C-terminus in several ascomycete laccases, in combination with the data obtained from the crystal structure of M. albomyces  laccase, further indicated that the C-terminal 
processing may be important for laccase activity. 
M. albomyces lac1  cDNA was expressed in S. cerevisiae  using four different 
expression constructs. Highest laccase pr oduction was obtained with a construct 
that contained the inducible GAL1  promoter, signal and propeptide sequences 
from the S. cerevisiae MF
α gene and lac1 cDNA encoding mature laccase 
protein, i.e. without the propeptide and the C-terminal extension. The most significant improvement in laccase production was obtained by replacing the lac1 signal and propeptide sequences with the α-factor prepro sequence. 
Because signal sequences are generally interchangeable between eukaryotic 
species, it is probable that the propeptid e cleavage was the problematic step for 
production of M. albomyces laccase in yeast. The efficient yeast expression 
system created in this study will facilitate the use of high throughput screening methods in directed evolution studies of M. albomyces  laccase in the future. 
Directed evolution could be used, for exam ple, to generate laccase mutants with 
altered substrate specificities, stabiliti es, pH profiles or redox potentials. 
M. albomyces laccase was also expressed in T. reesei  in order to obtain a reliable 
and efficient source for the laccase. In addition to unmodified laccase, a 
hydrophobin-laccase fusion protein was produced. The fusion was made in order to enhance the secretion of the heterologous protein and to simplify its purification. However, about fivefold hi gher activity levels were obtained with 
the non-fused laccase. According to the results, factors causing this difference 
included proteolytic degradation and inefficient secretion of the fusion protein. The non-fused recombinant M. albomyces  laccase was produced in a fed-batch 
fermentation and the production level of 920 mg l
-1 was the highest heterologous 
laccase production level reported so far.  In the future, laccase production may  
66 probably be further improved by optimiza tion of the cultivation parameters and 
by deleting cellulase genes from the lac case-producing transformant. In addition, 
the T. reesei  transformants producing high amounts of laccase can be used to 
study various factors related to heterolo gous protein expression in general in this 
industrially important fungus. Recombinant M. albomyces  laccase produced in 
T. reesei  was purified and compared to the native laccase. The results showed 
that the molecular weights, pIs, pH optima, temperature stabilities, C-termini, redox-potentials and substrate kinetics were very similar for both enzymes. 
Surprisingly, it was discovered that M. albomyces  laccase binds effectively to 
cellulose. Binding to cellulose has b een demonstrated for many enzymes 
involved in the modification of cellulose, but  this was the first time that a laccase 
was shown to bind to cellulose. M. albomyces  laccase was able to bind 
efficiently to steam-pretreated softw ood and to microcrystalline cellulose, but 
not to alkali lignin. No binding was detected with Trametes hirsuta  or 
Mauginiella  sp. laccases, suggesting that cellulose-binding ability is not a 
common feature of all laccases. Based on the adsorption parameters of M. 
albomyces  laccase, it was concluded that the laccase binds to cellulose with very 
high affinity but with rather low binding capacity. In addition, the binding was shown to be reversible and specific. In  the future, several interesting aspects 
concerning the binding interactions and the effects of various environmental 
conditions on binding remain to resolved . The evaluation of the benefits of 
cellulose binding in various applicati ons, such as textile dye oxidation and 
modification of lignocellulosics, will be also be important. 
This work provided information on novel fungal laccases from different aspects 
of enzymology, ranging from biochemical and molecular characterization to heterologous expression and binding st udies. The thorough analysis of the 
industrially interesting laccase from M. albomyces  has significantly increased 
our knowledge of the mode of action a nd molecular biology of laccases. These 
results will be of great help for future  studies focusing on the structure-function 
relatioships and heterolo gous production of laccases. In addition, deeper 
understanding of the biochemistry of l accases will facilitate the development of

ABSTRACT
L.-L. KIISKINEN, M. RA ¨TTO¨A ND K . KR UU S. 2004.
Aims: To discover novel laccases potential for industrial applications.
Methods and Results: Fungi were cultivated on solid media containing indicator compounds that enabled the
detection of laccases as speciﬁc colour reactions. The indicators used were Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), Poly
R-478, guaiacol and tannic acid. The screening work resulted in isolation of 26 positive fungal strains. Liquidcultivations of positive strains conﬁrmed that four efﬁcient laccase producers were found in the screening.Biochemical characteristics of the four novel laccases were typical for fungal laccases in terms of molecular weight,pH optima and pI. The laccases showed good thermal stability at 60 /C176C.
Conclusions: Plate-test screening based on polymeric dye compounds, guaiacol and tannic acid is an efﬁcient way
to discover novel laccase producers. The results indicated that screening for laccase activity can be performed withguaiacol and RBBR or Poly R-478.Signiﬁcance and Impact of the Study: Laccases have many potential industrial applications including textile
dye decolourization, deligniﬁcation of pulp and efﬂuent detoxiﬁcation. It is essential to ﬁnd novel, efﬁcient enzymesto further develop these applications. This study showed that relatively simple plate test screening method can beused for discovery of novel laccases.
Keywords: guaiacol, laccase, Poly R-478, RBBR, screening, tannic acid.
INTRODUCTION
Laccases (benzenediol : oxygen oxidoreductases; EC
1.10.3.2) exist widely in nature. They are predominantlyfound in higher plants and fungi (Thurston 1994; Mayerand Staples 2002), and recently some bacterial laccases
have also been characterized from Azospirillum lipoferum
(Givaudan et al. 1993), Bacillus subtilis (Martins et al.
2002), Streptomyces lavendulae (Suzuki et al. 2003) and S.
cyaneus (Arias et al. 2003). Most of the laccases studied
thus far are of fungal origin, especially from white-rot
fungi, such as Phlebia radiata (Niku-Paavola et al. 1988),
Pleurotus ostreatus (Palmieri et al. 2000) and Trametes
versicolor (Bourbonnais et al. 1995). The physiologicalroles of fungal laccases include degradation of lignocellulo-sic materials, pigment production and plant pathogenesis(Thurston 1994). Laccases oxidize a surprisingly widevariety of organic and inorganic compounds, includingdiphenols, polyphenols, substituted phenols, diamines andaromatic amines, with concomitant reduction of molecular
oxygen to water (Thurston 1994). Large variety of
potential substrates has raised interest in the use oflaccases in several industrial applications, such as pulpdeligniﬁcation, textile dye bleaching, efﬂuent detoxiﬁca-tion, biopolymer modiﬁcation and bioremediation (Gianf-reda et al. 1999; Xu 1999).
Discovery of novel laccases with different substrate
speciﬁcities and improved stabilities is important for indus-
trial applications. Microbes that produce laccases have been
screened for either on solid media containing colouredindicator compounds that enable the visual detection oflaccase production (Nishida et al. 1988; De Jong et al. 1992;
Barbosa et al. 1996) or with liquid cultivations monitored

In:  Journal of Applied Microbiology 2004.Vol. 97, pp. 640–646.with enzyme activity measurements (Szklarz et al. 1989;
Pela´ezet al. 1995; Luterek et al. 1997). The use of coloured
indicators is generally simpler as no sample handling and
measurement is required. As laccases oxidize various types
of substrates, several different compounds have been used asindicators for laccase production. The traditional screeningreagents tannic and gallic acid (Harkin and Obst 1973) havenowadays mostly been replaced with synthetic phenolicreagents, such as guaiacol and syringaldazine (Nishida et al.
1988; De Jong et al. 1992) or with the polymeric dyes
Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) and Poly R-478 (Barbosa
et al. 1996; D’Souza et al. 1999; Raghukumar et al. 1999).
RBBR and Poly R-478 are decolourized by lignin-degrading
fungi (Gold et al. 1988; Barbosa et al. 1996), and the
production of ligninolytic enzymes is observed as a colour-less halo around microbial growth. With guaiacol a positivereaction is indicated by the formation of a reddish-brownhalo (Nishida et al. 1988), while with tannic and gallic acid
the positive reaction is a dark-brown coloured zone (Harkin
and Obst 1973).
In this study, laccase-producing fungi were isolated from
various environmental samples using four different indicator
compounds in agar plates. The screening results withdifferent indicators were also compared in order to reducethe number of indicator compounds needed in futurescreening procedures. In addition, the production of laccaseby the positive strains was monitored in liquid cultures. The
laccases that were produced in signiﬁcant amounts were
preliminarily characterized.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Solid media used in the screening
Malt extract agar (MEA) and potato dextrose agar (PDA)
from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI, USA) were used to
isolate fungi. 0 Æ01% (w/v) of chloramphenicol and chloro-
tetracycline (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) were added to themedia in order to inhibit the growth of bacteria. In addition,1% (w/v) of Benomyl, a benzimidazole fungicide (Du Pontde Nemours & Co., Wilmington, DE, USA), was added inorder to select for wood decay fungi (Maloy 1974). Benomylwas autoclaved together with the media, whereas chloram-
phenicol and chlorotetracycline were added to the media
after autoclaving.
Indicator compounds used in the screening
Different indicator compounds were added to the solid
media in order to detect microbes that producedligninolytic enzymes: 0 Æ04% (w/v) RBBR (Sigma),
0Æ04% Poly R-478 (Sigma), 0 Æ01% guaiacol (Sigma) or
0Æ5% tannic acid (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA).Guaiacol was added to the media before autoclaving, andRBBR and Poly R-478 after autoclaving as sterile-ﬁlteredwater solutions. Tannic acid was autoclaved separately
before addition to the media. The correlation between
positive reactions with different indicators was investigatedby cross-cultivating positive strains on all different indi-cator plates. The white-rot fungus Trametes hirsuta (VTT
D-95443) that produces laccase (Rittstieg et al. 2002),
manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase (unpub-lished data), was used as a positive control for indicatorplates.
Isolation of micro-organisms
Laccase-producing microbes were screened from various
environmental samples taken in Finland: decomposing treestump, oak leaf compost, birch log, spruce chip pile and testcompost of municipal biowaste at different compostingstages. In addition, microbes were isolated from crude cork
material and process waters of a Portuguese cork factory (A.
Silva, Porto, Portugal) and from a soiled pulp sample from apulp mill in Svetogorsk, Russia. Fungi were isolated byplacing pieces of samples on MEA and PDA platescontaining different indicator compounds. The plates wereincubated at 30 /C176C for at least a week. Positive strains were
subcultured when clear positive reactions were visible.
Cultivations in liquid media
Fungal strains showing positive reactions in the plate-test
screening were grown in different types of liquid media. Atﬁrst, the positive fungi were cultivated in malt extract,potato dextrose and yeast mold (YM) broth (Difco) to testfor the production of laccase. Subsequently, laccase-positivefungal strains were cultivated in two types of rich media to
improve laccase production: soya meal medium (10 g l
)1
soya meal, 20 g l)1glucose and minerals; Kiiskinen et al.
2002) and yeast extract medium (27 Æ5gl)1yeast extract,
25 g l)1glucose and minerals). In order to optimize enzyme
production, the ratio of carbon and nitrogen was varied in
the latter medium. The effect of different inducers onlaccase production was also studied in liquid cultures: 0 Æ05%
Tween 80 (Sigma), 0 Æ2 mmol l
)1veratryl alcohol (Sigma),
0Æ05% Indulin AT (Sigma), 1 mmol l)1guaiacol or 20 g l)1
spruce chips were added to malt extract, potato dextrose,YM, soya meal or yeast extract medium. The microbes werecultivated in 50 ml of medium in Erlenmeyer ﬂasks at 30 /C176C
on a rotary shaker (100–150 rev min
)1). Extracellular
laccase production was measured by monitoring the oxida-tion of 5 mmol l
)1ABTS in 25 mmol l)1succinate buffer
(pH 4 Æ5) at 436 nm and using an extinction coefﬁcient of
29 300 l mol)1cm)1(Niku-Paavola et al. 1988). The activ-
ities were expressed as katals (mol s)1).SCREENING FOR NOVEL LACCASES 641

I/2Puriﬁcation of laccases
Laccases from strains LLP13 and AH2 were partially
puriﬁed by two chromatographic steps at room temperature.
Clear culture supernatants were ﬁrst applied to a DEAESepharose Fast Flow column (1 Æ6·13 cm; Pharmacia,
Uppsala, Sweden), which was equilibrated with20 mmol l
)1Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7 Æ1) for LLP13 laccase
or with 20 mmol l)1acetate buffer (pH 5 Æ5) for AH2
laccase. Proteins were eluted with a linear increasingNa
2SO4gradient of 0–300 m MMfor LLP13 or 0–500 m MM
for AH2, and laccase-positive fractions were pooled. LLP13laccase was further puriﬁed with a Phenyl Sepharose FastFlow column (1 Æ6·9 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated with
20 mmol l
)1citrate buffer (pH 5 Æ0), containing
700 mmol l)1Na2SO4. Proteins were eluted with a linear
decreasing 700–0 mmol l)1Na2SO4gradient. AH2 laccase
was further puriﬁed with gel ﬁltration on a Sephacryl S-100HR column (1 Æ6·90 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated with
100 mmol l
)1sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7 Æ0) containing
100 mmol l)1NaCl. Laccase puriﬁcation was monitored
with SDS-PAGE (12% Tris-HCl Ready Gel; Bio-Rad;Hercules, CA, USA) (Laemmli 1970). Puriﬁcation of themajor laccase from the strain LLP12 is published elsewhere(Niku-Paavola et al. 2004).
Characterization of novel laccases
The isoelectric points of LLP13, LLP17 and AH2 laccases
were determined with isoelectric focusing as previouslydescribed (Kiiskinen et al. 2002). The pH optima for
laccases were determined in the universal McIlvaine buffer(Dawson et al. 1959) within a pH range of 2 Æ2–8 Æ0 using
ABTS and guaiacol as substrates (Kiiskinen et al. 2002).
The temperature stabilities were determined by incubating
the enzyme solutions in 60 mmol l
)1citrate buffer (pH 6) at
different temperatures and determining the residual enzyme
activity at room temperature with ABTS as a substrate. TheN-terminus of AH2 laccase as well as the internal peptideswere sequenced according to Edman degradation chemistryusing PE Biosystems Procise Sequencer (PE Biosystems,Foster City, CA, USA) (Kiiskinen et al. 2002).
RESULTS
Isolation of microbes
Altogether 26 fungal strains showing positive reactions on
indicator plates were isolated from the collected samples.Positive strains were found from all the sources explored. Thecrude cork material from Portugal proved to be the best
source, as altogether 10 positive strains were isolated from it.
As for the test compost of municipal biowaste, three positivestrains were isolated only at the late maturation phase. Of the26 positive fungal strains, 16 were isolated from platescontaining the polymeric indicators RBBR or Poly R-478, and
eight strains from the guaiacol plates. Tannic acid gave
relatively weak positive reactions with many samples. How-ever, the ability of most positive microbes to form browncolour on tannic acid weakened during subculturing, whereaswith other indicators the same effect was not observed. Onlytwo fungal strains (LLP11 and LLP16) were so stronglypositive on tannic acid plates that they were considered aslaccase positives. Malt extract agar proved to be the best media
for isolating laccase-producing fungi. The most promising
positive fungal strains were identiﬁed by the Centraalbureauvoor Schimmelcultures (Baarn, The Netherlands; Table 1).Fungi from nine different genera were discovered from theenvironmental samples. Most of the isolated fungi wereseparate species, but Mucor circinelloides van Tieghem was
found from three different environmental samples.
Speciﬁcity of the indicators
Reactions with the four different indicators, RBBR, Poly R-
478, guaiacol and tannic acid, were tested with the fungalstrains LLP1-LLP21 on malt extract agar plates. Thepositive reactions with RBBR and Poly R-478 correlatedwell with each other: only one strain, LLP20, of 20 testedshowed a positive reaction only with Poly R-478 and not
with RBBR (Table 2). The correlation between the poly-
meric dyes and guaiacol was also good, as only one strain,LLP9, was positive on guaiacol without being positive onpolymeric dye indicators. Tannic acid seemed to be lessspeciﬁc, as it failed to give positive results with 10 strainsthat were positive on other indicators. In addition, there wasone strain, LLP11, that was positive only on tannic acid.

I/3The control strain T. hirsuta gave strong positive reactions
with all the tested indicators.
Production of laccases in liquid media
Laccase production by the positive strains found in the
screening was studied in liquid cultures. Detectable laccaseproduction was observed with nine isolated fungal strains:LLP1-5, LLP12-13, LLP15, LLP17-18 and AH2 (Table 3).Considerable laccase activities were measured with strainsLLP12, LLP13, LLP17 and AH2, whereas other positivestrains produced very low activity levels (Table 3). Laccaseproduction proved to be very much dependent on themedium, and the highest laccase activities were detected on
soya meal medium. With the strains LLP13 and LLP17,
laccase production was enhanced by the addition of woodchips, whereas the strain AH2 produced highest laccaseactivities when glucose concentration was decreased to10 g l
)1, and the medium was supplemented with 5 g l)1
Bacto peptone.
Characterization of novel laccases
The highest laccase production was detected with the strains
LLP12, LLP13, LLP17 and AH2, and the laccases fromthese strains were further analysed. All the strains showedmultiple laccase isoforms in isoelectric focusing, and themajor isoforms from LLP13 and AH2 were puriﬁed in thisstudy. The pH optima were determined with ABTS orguaiacol as substrates. All novel laccases discovered in this
screening had their pH optima at acidic pH values (Table 4).
The thermal stabilities were relatively high for these laccasesas the half-lives at 60 /C176C ranged from 3 to 5 h (Table 4).
The AH2 laccase was considered the most interesting
because of its high thermal stability. Therefore, it wasfurther characterized. Altogether 15 amino acid residuesfrom the N-terminus as well as two internal peptidesequences of 14 and 15 amino acids, respectively, were
determined for the puriﬁed protein and compared with
other known laccase sequences (Table 5). The level of aminoacid identity at the N-terminus was 86% with Trametes trogii
laccase (Colao et al. 2003), 86% with Trametes villosa
Laccase 4 (Yaver and Golightly 1996), 80% with Trametes
versicolor Laccase 4 (Jo ¨nsson et al. 1995), 73% with
Pycnoporus cinnabarinus laccase (Eggert et al. 1998) and
73% with Phlebia radiata laccase (Saloheimo et al. 1991).
CONCLUSIONS
Screening for laccase-producing microbes on plates con-
taining coloured indicators resulted in isolation of 26 fungalstrains. Crude cork material and soiled pulp proved to behighly interesting sources for laccase producers. This ispresumably because of the presence of relatively high
concentration of laccase substrates in these environments.
Besides the well known ligninolytic fungi, some positivestrains isolated in this work were identiﬁed to belong tofungal species not previously reported to produce laccases.Two different isolates were identiﬁed as Peniophora species,
one as Rhizopus microsporus var.rhizopodiformis and four as
Mucor species. Fungi from the genera Peniophora ,Rhizopus
orMucor have not thus far been reported to produce
ligninolytic enzymes. An interesting ﬁnding was also thatthree clearly positive isolates were identiﬁed as TrichodermaTable 2 Comparison of reactions of the isolated fungal strains LLP1-

I/4atroviride orTrichoderma harzianum .Trichoderma strains
have been reported to produce polyphenoloxidases (Assav-
aniget al. 1992; Score et al. 1997), and recently the presence
of cell-wall associated laccase in T. atroviride and T.
harzianum was demonstrated by Ho ¨lkeret al. (2002). The
rest of the fungal strains isolated in this study belonged togenera that are known to produce ligninolytic enzymeactivities: Sporotrichum (Rohrmann and Molitoris 1992;
Luterek et al. 1997), Bjerkandera (Rohrmann and Molitoris
1992; Kaal et al. 1993), Chrysosporium (Buckley and Dobson
1998), Pholiota (Bollag and Leonowicz 1984) and Phlebia
(Niku-Paavola et al. 1990).Comparison of the reactions with different indicators
showed that the polymeric dyes RBBR and Poly R-478 gavevery similar results, thus either one can be chosen for anindicator in future screening procedures. Reactions withguaiacol also correlated well with reactions on the polymericdyes. However, tannic acid deviated substantially from thepolymeric dyes and guaiacol. Tannic acid is one of thetraditional screening reagents for laccases (Harkin and Obst
1973). Our results suggest, however, that colour reactions
with synthetic dyes and guaiacol are more easily detectable,detect more laccase-positives, and these compounds can thusreliably be used for laccase activity screening.Table 4 Biochemical characteristics of the novel laccases

I/5Laccase production by the fungal strains that were
positive in the plate-test screening was further studied in
liquid cultures. Using various growth media, nine strains
were shown to produce detectable amounts of laccase in
culture supernatant as detected by activity on ABTS.Some of the strains that showed positive reactions onindicator plates but did not produce laccase in liquidcultures may have produced other ligninolytic enzymes,such as manganese-dependent peroxidases or lignin per-oxidases, because these enzymes are also capable ofdecolourizing the polymeric dyes (De Jong et al. 1992;
Rodrı ´guez Couto et al. 2000; Ryu et al. 2003). Differen-
tiation among these activities cannot thus be made onplate-tests. The production level of laccases in liquidcultures were quite low (below 1 nkat ml
)1) in most of the
media tested. However, four fungal strains, LLP12,LLP13, LLP17 and AH2, produced signiﬁcant amountsof laccase (22–40 nkat ml
)1) in very rich media containing
soya meal. This is in agreement with other results showing
that laccase production is highly dependent on the
medium and cultivation conditions (Niku-Paavola et al.
1990; Rogalski et al. 1991; Schlosser et al. 1997). The
strain LLP12 was identiﬁed as Peniophora sp., LLP17 as
Peniophora orLopharia sp., AH2 as Pholiota sp., whereas
LLP13 was an unidentiﬁable haploid Basidiomycete.
Preliminary characterization of four laccases from LLP13,
LLP17, AH2 and LLP12 showed that these laccases were
typical basidiomycete laccases with molecular weights around
60–70 kDa, isoelectric points around 4 and pH optima at anacidic pH range. In addition, the N-terminal amino acidsequence and two internal peptide sequences of AH2 ( Pholiota
sp.) showed high homology to other basidiomycete laccases.Interestingly, the thermal stabilities of these laccases weresubstantially high: the half-lives at 60 /C176C ranged from 3 to 5 h.
Typically, half-lives at this temperature for fungal laccases
have been reported to be ca0Æ5–1 h (Heinzkill et al. 1998;
Tagger et al. 1998; Robles et al. 2000; Palonen et al. 2003).
Good thermostability is an important factor in industrial
applications. This study showed that interesting novel laccaseproducers can be discovered from environmental samples byvery simple plate-test screening methods.

I/7Abstract A novel laccase from the ascomycete Melano-
carpus albomyces was purified and characterised. The
enzyme was purified using anion exchange chromatog-
raphy, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gelfiltration, and the purified laccase was biochemicallycharacterised. It had activity towards typical substratesof laccases including 2,2 ′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazo-
line-6-sulphonate), dimethoxyphenol, guaiacol, and sy-ringaldazine. The laccase showed good thermostabilityand it had a pH optimum at neutral pH, both unusualproperties for most known fungal laccases. The activityof the laccase from M. albomyces was highest at
60–70°C. With guaiacol and syringaldazine the pH optima were rather broad: 5–7.5 and 6–7, respectively. Itretained 50% of its activity after 5 h incubation at 60°C.The molecular weight of the laccase was about 80 kDaand the isoelectric point 4.0. The ultraviolet-visible ab-sorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra ofthe purified laccase indicated that the typical three typesof copper were present.
Introduction
Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductases, EC1.10.3.2) are multi-copper enzymes belonging to thegroup of blue oxidases. They catalyse oxidation of asurprisingly wide variety of organic and inorganic com-pounds, including diphenols, polyphenols, diamines,substituted phenols, and aromatic amines by a one-elec-tron transfer mechanism. Molecular oxygen is used asthe electron acceptor. The substrate loses a single elec-tron and usually forms a free radical. The unstable radi-cal may undergo further laccase-catalysed oxidation ornon-enzymatic reactions including hydration, dispropor-tionation, and polymerisation (Thurston 1994).Laccase or laccase-like activity has been demon-
strated in higher plants, some insects and a few bacteria(Gianfreda et al. 1999). However, most known laccasesare of fungal origin, especially from the class of white-rot fungi. Laccases are involved in several physiologicalfunctions, such as lignin biosynthesis, plant pathogene-sis, insect sclerotisation, and degradation of lignocellulo-sic materials. It is well recognised that laccases are in-volved in both polymerisation and depolymerisation pro-cesses of lignin (Thurston 1994). Laccases are seen asindustrially interesting enzymes because they haveshown potential in various applications including pulpbleaching, textile dye bleaching, detergents, and enzy-matic conversion of chemical intermediates (Xu 1999).
For many applications it is important to find an en-
zyme that is thermostable and works at relatively highpH-values. Thermophilic fungi could comprise a poten-tial source of thermostable enzymes. A thermophilic as-comycete Melanocarpus albomyces , formerly known as
Myriococcum albomyces , has previously been reported
to produce xylanases and cellulases with pronouncedthermal stability and activity at alkaline pH range (Jainet al. 1998; Prabhu and Maheshwari 1999). We reporthere that M. albomyces also produces a laccase with very
interesting pH and temperature characteristics.
Materials and methods

soil in Saudi Arabia), was maintained on oatmeal agar (Difco, 
Detroit, Mich.).

ed with agar pieces cut from well-grown mycelium on oatmeal
agar. After 2 days cultivation at 37°C (160 rpm), the culture washomogenized and used to inoculate 1 l of culture medium in a 3 lErlenmeyer flask. The flasks were incubated at 37°C on a rotaryshaker (160 rpm). Laccase activity in the culture filtrate was mea-sured daily and the enzyme was collected when laccase activityreached its maximum. The mycelium was removed by filtrationthrough Whatman no. 1 filter paper.
Protein and enzyme activity determinations
Laccase activity was measured according to Niku-Paavola et al.
(1988) using ABTS [2,2 ′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sul-
phonate)], (Boehringer Mannheim; Mannheim, Germany) as asubstrate. The laccase activity was also measured with syringa-ldazine (Sigma) according to Leonowicz and Grzywnowicz(1981), guaiacol (Sigma) according to Paszczynski et al. (1985),and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (Sigma) according to Wariishi et al.(1992). All these activity assays were carried out in 25 mM succi-nate buffer (pH 4.5) at 25°C using a two-beam spectrophotometer(Lambda 20, Perkin-Elmer, Überlingen, Germany). The activitytowards tyrosine was measured at a tyrosine concentration of0.2 mM in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) at 25°C and at475 nm by monitoring dopachrome formation and using the molarextinction coefficient ε3,600 M
–1 cm–1(Lerch and Ettlinger
1972). Activities were expressed as nanokatals. The protein con-centration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit(Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif.) with bovine serum albumin as a stan-dard.
Protein purification
The clear culture supernatant was concentrated and the buffer
changed to 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 5, with an Amicon 8400 ultrafiltration unit using a PM30 membrane (Millipore, Bedford,Mass.). The subsequent purification steps were carried out at roomtemperature. The sample was applied to a DEAE Sepharose FastFlow column (1.6 ×13 cm; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), which
was pre-equilibrated with 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 5. Proteinswere eluted with a linear 0–200 mM Na
2SO4gradient (90 ml) in
acetate buffer. Laccase-positive fractions were pooled. UsingNa
2SO4, the pH and ionic strength of the pooled sample were ad-
justed to correspond to those of 400 mM Na2SO4 in 20 mM citrate
buffer, pH 5. The sample was applied to a Phenyl Sepharose FastFlow column (1.6 ×9 cm; Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM
citrate buffer, pH 5, containing 400 mM Na
2SO4. Proteins were
eluted with a linear 400–0 mM Na2SO4gradient (90 ml) in citrate
buffer, thereafter with 2 mM citrate buffer (pH 5), and finally withdistilled water. Laccase-positive fractions were pooled, concen-trated, and applied to a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (1.6 ×90 cm;
Pharmacia) equilibrated with 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer,pH 7. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated on an Amicon PM10 membrane (Millipore).
SDS-PAGE (12% Tris-HCl Ready Gel, Bio-Rad) was per-
formed according to Laemmli (1970). Protein bands were visual-ised by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R350; Pharmacia)and compared with molecular weight markers (Prestained ProteinMarker Broad Range Cat. no. 7708S; New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.).
Determination of isoelectric point
The isoelectric point of M. albomyces laccase was determined by
isoelectric focusing within the pH range of 2.5–5.0 (Pharmalyte
2.5–5.0 for IEF, Pharmacia) on an LKB 2117 Multiphor II Electro-phoresis System (LKB Pharmacia, Bromma, Sweden) according tothe manufacturer's instructions. Bands containing laccase activitywere visualised by staining the gel with 2 mM ABTS in 25 mMsuccinate buffer (pH 4.5) and proteins by Coomassie Blue staining.Enzyme activity and stability with respect to pH and temperature
The pH optimum for purified M. albomyces laccase was deter-
mined in McIlvaine (Dawson et al. 1959) buffer within a pH range
of 2.2–8.0 using ABTS, guaiacol and syringaldazine as substrates.The stability of the enzyme at different pH-values was determinedin McIlvaine buffer by incubating the purified enzyme solution(20 nkat/ml) at different pH-values at room temperature. The re-sidual laccase activity was determined by measuring the activityof the enzyme solutions with ABTS as described above. The effectof temperature on enzyme activity was determined by measuringthe enzyme activity with ABTS and guaiacol within a temperaturerange of 25–80°C. With ABTS the measurements were performedin 25 mM succinate buffer at pH 4.5, and with guaiacol in 50 mMcitrate buffer at pH 6. The temperature stability was determined byincubating the enzyme solution (200 nkat/ml) in 60 mM citratebuffer (pH 6) in different temperatures and determining the residu-al enzyme activity with guaiacol.
Spectra
The optical absorption spectrum of purified M. albomyces laccase
was measured with a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi,
Tokyo, Japan). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrawere recorded with a Bruker ESP 300 X-band spectrometer(Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 9.44 GHz and 12 K (cryostatfrom Oxford Instruments, Oxford, UK). Modulation frequencywas 100 kHz, modulation amplitude 0.99 mT, sweep time/scan168 s, sweep width 0.10 T, microwave power 1.00 mW, and pro-tein concentration 50 µM.
Inhibition of laccase activity
The effect of various inhibitors on laccase activity was determined
by measuring the oxygen consumption during the enzyme reactionwith ABTS in sealed and fully filled Erlenmeyer flasks with anOrion Research 081010 oxygen electrode (software: SensorLinkPCM800; Orion, Espoo, Finland). The oxygen consumption rates(nmol l
–1s–1) were measured from solutions containing 15 µg of
purified laccase (corresponding to an activity of about 15 nkat),2 mM ABTS, and 0–5 mM of various inhibitors (added simulta-neously with ABTS) in 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 5) in a 30 ml reaction volume. All measurements were taken in triplicate.
N-Terminal amino acid sequencing
The N-terminus of the protein and internal peptides were se-
quenced according to Edman degradation chemistry using PE Bio-systems Procise Sequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.).For peptide preparation, the lyophilised protein was reduced withdithiothreitol, carboxymethylated with iodoacetamide and cleavedwith sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, Wisc.) at an enzyme/substrate mass ratio of 1:100 for 12 h at 37°C in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3 (Stone et al. 1988). The peptidesgenerated were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HP 1050, HP GmbH, Waldbronn, Germany;Vydac C-18 column, Grace Vydac, Hesperia, Calif.) with a linearacetonitrile gradient (0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The amino acid sequence comparison of M. albomyces lac-
case with other laccase sequences was carried out with SIM-Align-ment tool for protein sequences (Huang and Miller 1991).
Results
Enzyme purification
Laccase-positive fractions eluted as a single peak at
about 100 mM salt concentration in anion exchange
II/2200
chromatography. Laccase remained in the hydrophobic
interaction column during decreasing salt gradient andeluted as a single peak with 2 mM citrate buffer. Anoverall 292-fold purification and activity recovery of17% was achieved. Table 1 shows a summary of the pu-rification. The purified laccase showed apparent homo-geneity on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1.). The molecular mass ofthe laccase as determined by SDS-PAGE was 80 kDa.Under nondenaturing conditions in isoelectric focusingboth the culture filtrate and the purified laccase showedonly one major band at pH 4.0 when stained with ABTS(results not shown). 
Spectra
The purified laccase had a blue colour typical of copper-
containing proteins. The ultraviolet-visible absorptionspectrum of the laccase showed two peaks at 280 and600 nm and a shoulder at 330 nm as shown in Fig. 2.The peak at 600 nm is typical for the type I Cu(II), andthe shoulder at 330 nm suggests the presence of the typeIII binuclear Cu(II) pair (Eggert et al. 1996). Figure 3presents the EPR absorption spectrum of purified M. al-
bomyces laccase. The spectrum is typical of fungal lac-cases and it reveals the presence of type II (hyperfineline above 2,700 G) and type I (region 2,900–3,200 G)Cu(II) ions (Karhunen et al. 1990). The estimated parameters ( g
IIand AII) are 2.18 and 0.010 cm–1for the 
narrowly spaced signal and 2.25 and ≥0.019 cm–1for the
widely spaced signal. 
Laccase activity with respect to pH and temperature
The pH optima for the purified laccase were determined
with ABTS, guaiacol, and syringaldazine as substrates.The results are shown in Fig. 4. The lowest pH optimum,3.5, was determined in oxidizing ABTS. Oxidation ofguaiacol showed a very broad pH optimum from 5.0 to7.5. The pH optimum for syringaldazine was within the

range of 6–7. Interestingly, the laccase still showed rela-
tively high activity at pH 8, both with syringaldazine and guaiacol (60 and 75%, respectively). The purifiedlaccase remained quite stable within the pH range of 4–8after 22 h incubation. However, at pH-values lower than 4, the enzyme lost its activity totally.
The activity of purified M. albomyces laccase was de-
termined at various temperatures (25–90°C) using ABTSand guaiacol as substrates. The enzyme showed highestactivity at 60–70°C. Beyond 70°C the activity droppedsharply. The activity remained unaltered after prolongedincubation (over 100 h) at 40°C, whereas it showed ahalf-life of about 50 h, 5 h, and 12 min at 50, 60, and70°C, respectively.
Substrates and inhibitors
Table 2 presents the specific activities of purified M. al-
bomyces laccase with various substrates. The specific 
activity was highest with ABTS. The other typical sub-
strates for laccases, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, syringaldaz-ine, and guaiacol, were also oxidized by this enzyme.However, tyrosine was clearly not a substrate, thus thislaccase does not belong to the group of tyrosinase-typepolyphenol oxidases (EC 1.10.3.1; EC 1.14.18.1). Theinhibition of laccase activity with different inhibitors isshown in Table 3. Sodium azide and potassium cyanidewere very effective inhibitors of M. albomyces laccase.
At a concentration of 1 mM, potassium cyanide inhibitedtotally and sodium azide inhibited 99% of the laccase activity. Sodium fluoride and EDTA caused some inacti-vation, but sodium chloride, p-coumaric acid and SDS
did not have any inhibition effect on this laccase underthe test conditions. 
N-Terminal amino acid sequence
The N-terminal and two internal amino acid sequences
of M. albomyces laccase were determined. When com-
pared to the amino acid sequences of known laccases,the highest identity was found with ascomycete laccases(Fig. 5), namely Neurospora crassa (Germann et al.
1988),Podospora anserina (Fernández-Larrea and Stahl
1996), and Cryphonectria parasitica (Choi et al. 1992).
The overall identity based on these sequences was high-est with the laccases of N. crassa and P. anserina (70%).

(Ong et al. 1997), Phlebia radiata (Saloheimo et al.
1991), Pleurotus ostreatus (Giardina et al. 1995), and
Rhizoctonia solani (Wahleithner et al. 1996), the identity
was found to be low (below 30%). The amino acid 
identity between M. albomyces laccase and the laccase
from the ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans (Aramayo and 
Timberlake 1990) was also remarkably low (below20%).
Discussion
M. albomyces has previously been reported to produce
several thermostable and alkaline xylanases, as well ascellulases (Vehmaanperä et al. 1997; Jain et al. 1998;Prabhu and Maheshwari 1999). According to Jain et al.(1998), M. albomyces xylanase has its maximum activity
at 70°C and is stable at that temperature for more than2 h. In addition, the xylanase retains more than 50% ofits activity at pH 10. The results reported here are thefirst to indicate that this thermophilic fungus also pro-duces a thermostable laccase.
The enzyme purified from M. albomyces was able 
to oxidize typical substrates for laccases: a variety ofphenolic compounds and non-phenolic ABTS. As previously reported, many fungal laccases show highestactivity towards ABTS. The relative activities towardsABTS, guaiacol, and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol for Pycno-
porus cinnabarinus laccase were 100, 31, and 22%, re-
spectively, for Coriolus hirsutus laccase, 100, 40, and
39% respectively (Eggert et al. 1996) and for Trichophy-
ton rubrum laccase 100, 33, and 36%, respectively (Jung
et al. 2002). The M. albomyces laccase also had highest
activity towards ABTS followed by syringaldazine, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and guaiacol. Similar to other laccasesthe enzyme did not show tyrosinase activity (Thurston1994). The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the puri-fied enzyme from M. albomyces showed a shoulder at
330 nm, which corresponds to a type-3 binuclear copperand a peak at 600 nm corresponding to a type-1 or theblue copper atom. These characteristics, as well as theEPR absorption spectrum, indicate that all three types ofcopper atoms are present (Eggert et al. 1996; Xu et al.1996). Based on the substrate specificity and spectral data we conclude that the enzyme purified from M. al-
bomycesis a true laccase.
Many sulfhydryl-containing compounds, e.g. 
L-cys-
teine, are often referred to as laccase inhibitors. Howev-er, Johannes and Majcherczyk (2000) recently showedthat the observed inhibitory effect is actually caused bythe reduction of the oxidized substrate by the sulfhydrylcompounds and not by true inhibition of the enzyme.That is why we tested the inhibitors by monitoring oxy-gen consumption in the reaction and not spectrophoto-metrically. From our results it is obvious that 
L-cysteine,
often considered a substrate for laccases, did not inhibitthe oxygen consumption by laccase. M. albomyces lac-
case was strongly inhibited by the typical laccase inhibi-tors potassium cyanide, sodium azide and sodium fluo-ride, but it was not sensitive to EDTA, SDS, coumaricacid or kojic acid.
The isoelectric focusing PAGE indicated the presence
of only one isoform of laccase in the culture supernatant,whereas many laccases have been reported to be pro-duced as multiple isoforms, e.g. Trametes villosa pro-
duces at least three laccase isoforms (Bourbonnais et al.1995) and Pleurotus ostreatus four isoforms (Palmieri et
al. 2000). The molecular weight of the purified laccase(ca. 80,000 Da) is consistent with the molecular weightsof most other fungal laccases, which have been reportedto be between 60,000 and 80,000 Da (Thurston 1994).
The pH optimum of the M. albomyces laccase de-
pended very much on the substrate. The laccase exhibit-ed a rather low pH optimum (3.5) with ABTS as a sub-strate, like many other fungal laccases (Xu 1997; Robleset al. 2000). With guaiacol and syringaldazine, the pHoptima were very broad: 5–7.5 and 6–7, respectively.The difference in pH optima for ABTS and phenolic sub-strates is typical for laccases and it reflects the differencein oxidation mechanism with different substrates. Sincethe oxidation of ABTS does not involve protons, the only effect of elevated pH on oxidation rate is the in-creasing inhibition of laccase by OH
–ions (Xu 1997).
The instability of the oxidation product of syringaldazineat pH-values above 7 may also affect the activity resultsobtained at alkaline pH-values. Compared to many otherfungal laccases, e.g. those of Trametes versicolor
(Schlosser et al. 1997), Pycnoporus cinnabarinus
(Eggert et al. 1996), Trametes villosa (Xu 1997), and
Thermoascus aurantiacus (Machuca et al. 1998), the
noteworthy feature of the M. albomyces laccase is its 
activity at alkaline pH: the enzyme still showed 75% of maximum activity at pH 8 with guaiacol. In addition,the enzyme showed good stability at alkaline pH-values,over 90% of the activity remained after 22 h incubationat pH 8.
Besides high stability at elevated pH-values, the 
M. albomyces laccase showed good thermostability. Its
activity remained virtually unaltered at 60°C for up to2 h. This kind of combination of thermal- and pH-stabili-ty is very rare among fungal laccases. Many other lac-cases that have a pH optimum around 6–7 are not asthermostable as M. albomyces laccase. For example, lac-
cases from Coprinus friesii , Panaeolus papilionaceus
and Panaeolus sphinctrinus have unusually high pH 
optima (7–8) with dimethoxyphenol, but do not remainactive at 60°C (Heinzkill et al. 1998). Similarly, the neu-tral laccases from Myceliophthora thermophila (Berka 
et al. 1997), Chaetomium thermophilum (Chefetz et al.
1998), and Coprinus cinereus (Schneider et al. 1999) re-
tain less than 75% of maximum activity at 60°C after1 h. In addition, thermal activation in which incubationat higher temperatures results in higher activity wasclearly observed with M. albomyces laccase, as previous-
ly reported for laccases from M. thermophila and S. ther-
mophilum (Xu et al. 1996).
The comparison of the N-terminal amino acid 
sequence and two internal peptide sequences of M. al-
II/5203
bomyces laccase with other fungal laccases showed that
the M. albomyces laccase clearly resembles other asco-
mycete laccases. In comparison, the identity with basid-
iomycete laccases was low. These results support thetheory that the genes of ascomycete and basidiomycetelaccases have evolved significantly after the phyloge-netic divergence of the two classes of fungi (Fernández-Larrea and Stahl 1996; Berka et al. 1997). Currently, weare isolating the gene encoding the M. albomyces laccase
in order to express the protein heterologously to achievehigher production levels as well as to further analyse theenzyme properties.

W e have crystallized the ascomycete laccase from Melano-
carpus albomyces with all four coppers present and deter-
mined the crystal structure at 2.4 Å resolution. The enzyme is
heavily glycosylated and consists of three cupredoxin-likedomains, similar to those found in the Cu-depleted basidio-mycete laccase from 
Coprinus cinereus . However, there are
significant differences in the loops forming the substrate-binding pocket. In addition, the crystal structure of the 
M. albomyces laccase
revealed elongated electron density between allthree coppers in the trinuclear copper site, suggesting that an oxygen molecule binds with anovel geometry. This oxygen, required in thereaction, may enter the trinuclear site throughthe tunnel, which is open in the structure of the
C. cinereus laccase. In contrast, the C-terminus
on the M. albomyces laccase forms a plug that
blocks this access.
Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductases,
EC 1.10.3.2) are widely distributed in Nature.
Laccase activity has been demonstrated in higherplants, some insects and a few bacteria. However,most known laccases are of fungal origin. Inplants, they participate in wound response andlignin synthesis
1. The fungal laccases are involved
in lignin degradation, as well as in several otherfunctions including pigmentation, sporulation,pathogenicity and detoxification
2. Laccases have
been tested in many industrial applications, suchas pulp bleaching, textile dye decolorization, detergents, bio-glueing and detoxification
3.
Laccases catalyze the oxidation of a wide variety of substrates,
including various phenolic compounds and anilines4,5. The one-
electron oxidation of the reducing substrate occurs concomi-tantly with the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen towater. Laccases belong to the blue multi-copper oxidase family(reviewed in refs 6,7), which includes ascorbate oxidase andmammalian plasma ceruloplasmin. These proteins have a mini-mum of one mononuclear copper site containing one type-1 Cu(blue Cu) and a trinuclear copper site containing one type-2 Cu(normal Cu)
7and two type-3 Cu (coupled binuclear Cu).
Substrates are oxidized near the mononuclear site, and the elec-trons are transferred to the trinuclear site, where the molecularoxygen is reduced. Neither the electron transfer mechanism northe oxygen reduction to water is fully understood.
Although laccases have been extensively studied, only one
crystal structure is available so far: the type-2 Cu depleted lac-case from Coprinus cinereus
8,9. In addition, the crystallization of
laccases from Trametes versicolor and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus
have been reported10,11. Here we present the three-dimensional
structure of the fully active laccase from Melanocarpus albomyces
that contains all four copper ions. This ascomycete laccase sharesonly ∼20–30% sequence identity with basidiomycete laccases,

The laccase from M. albomyces shows high thermostability and
has a pH optimum at neutral. These characteristics are rare
among fungal laccases, making the M. albomyces laccase an
interesting enzyme for different applications.
Overall structure
The crystal structure of the M. albomyces laccase (MaL) shows
that the enzyme is a monomer consisting of three cupredoxin-likedomains: A (1–157), B (158–341) and C (342–559) (Fig. 1 a). MaL
is heavily glycosylated, which substantially increases the mole-cular weight of the enzyme. Out of nine putative N-glycosylationsites, we found carbohydrates at seven sites in molecule A of theasymmetric unit and eight in molecule B of the asymmetric unit.For molecule A, the calculated molecular mass without the carbo-hydrates would be 62.0 kDa, but would increase to 65.9 kDa withobserved carbohydrates. According to SDS-PAGE, the estimatedmass is ∼83 kDa; the additional mass is presumably from parts of
the carbohydrates that are disordered and not visible in the elec-tron density map. The structure is stabilized by three disulfidebridges: Cys 4–Cys 12, located in domain A; Cys 114–Cys 540,located between domains A and C; and Cys 298–Cys 332, locatedin domain B near the substrate-binding site.
The molecular architecture of laccase is common for all blue
multi-copper oxidases, such as ascorbate oxidase
12,13and mam-
malian plasma ceruloplasmin14. The overall fold of MaL is simi-
lar to that found in the type-2 Cu-depleted laccase from C. cinereus (CcL) (Fig. 1 b). The sequence identity between MaL
and CcL laccases is 26% (Fig. 1 c). Despite this similarity, the
structures are different in many respects. MaL has a longer N-terminus, which contains an additional disulfide bridge.Many loops, including some of the loops that form the substrate-binding pocket, are clearly different from CcL. Theremarkable feature is that the C-terminal end of MaL is buried.
Substrate-binding pocket
T o identify a possible binding pocket for the substrate, the solvent-accessible surfaces of MaL and CcL were calculated nearthe type-1 Cu. The binding pocket of MaL is narrower comparedto that of CcL (Fig. 2 a). Five loops that are potentially involved
in substrate binding are located between β-strands B1 and B2,
B4 and B5, B7 and B8, C4 and C5, and C7 and C8 (Figs 1 c, 2b).
Because β-strands B5 and B7, as well as C5 and C7, are adjacent,
the loops are located near to each other. Only loop B1–B2 istopologically and structurally further away.
In domain B, the first putative substrate-binding loop B1–B2
is six residues longer in MaL compared to that in CcL. In MaL, asmall helix located in this loop is longer and brings the loopmuch closer to the active site. Pro 192 in the active site of MaLprobably packs against the substrate. The high-resolution struc-ture of CcL lacks electron density for three residues in this loop,indicating mobility of the loop. In MaL, Glu 235 (Asp 205 inCcL), which is located in the β-hairpin between B4 and B5, is a
good candidate for a ligand-binding residue. The structure ofthe third loop B7–B8 is completely different in MaL comparedto CcL. In MaL, the loop is much closer to the active site andmakes the substrate-binding pocket tighter. In addition, theloop B7–B8 forms a disulfide bridge (Cys 298–Cys 332) toanother loop. The main chain Ala 297-Cys 298-Gly 299 in loopB7–B8 may pack against the substrate. In MaL, the fourth puta-tive substrate-binding loop C4–C5 contains nine residues and issituated in domain C. The loop is three residues longer andclearly different from the corresponding loop in CcL. The puta-tive substrate-binding residues of MaL in this loop are Phe 427and Leu 429 (Fig. 2 c). In addition, Ile 505 (present also in CcL),
located in the fifth loop C7–C8 before the helix, may also inter-act with the substrate.
Copper sites
The mononuclear site contains one type-1 Cu, which is trigonallycoordinated to two ND atoms from a His residue and a SG atomfrom a Cys (Fig. 3 a; Table 1). There is an axial SD atom from Met
2.9 Å away from Cu 1 in ascorbate oxidase
12. However, in laccases,
the Met is replaced by a Leu residue (or a Phe in some laccases),which can occur in a different conformation. In CcL, Cu 1 is 3.5 Åfrom the CD2 of Leu 462, but in MaL the Cu 1 is 3.7 Å away fromthe CD1 of the corresponding Leu 513. No residue occupies theaxial position on the other side, so this position is free for the sub-strate.
So far, information about the trinuclear copper site has been
inadequate because the only available laccase structure lacks thetype-2 Cu, which changes the geometry of the trinuclear siteconsiderably. Our MaL structure reveals new information aboutthe trinuclear copper site. In this site, two type-3 Cu atoms (Cu2and Cu3) are coordinated to six His N atoms, and type-2 Cu(Cu 4) is coordinated to two His N atoms and to one atom that isprobably a chloride ion (Fig. 3 a; Table 1). Thus, the basic archi-
tecture is similar to that observed in ascorbate oxidase, but thedistance between the two type-3 coppers in MaL is 4.8 Å, whichis ∼1.1 Å longer than the oxidized form of ascorbate oxidase
(Table 1). Interestingly, the distances between all three copperatoms of MaL are closer to the values obtained for the reducedform of ascorbate oxidase, in which the distance between twotype-3 coppers is 5.1 Å.Fig. 2 Molecular surfaces of a, MaL and b, CcL. Red represents negative

nature structural biology • volume 9 number 8 • august 2002 603Dioxygen binding
We observed an elongated electron density amidst the three cop-
per atoms in the trinuclear site (Fig. 3 b). The oxygen molecule is
located in the middle of the two type-3 coppers, and there is noevidence for a bridging OH group between these coppers, asobserved for ascorbate oxidase in oxidized form
12. All distances
between the O1 and O2 atoms of the dioxygen and the type-3coppers (Cu2 and Cu3) are 2.4–2.6 Å. The distance between theO1 atom of the dioxygen and the type-2 copper (Cu4) is also2.5 Å (Table 1). The coordination of type-3 coppers could bedescribed as a distorted tetrahedral and of type-2 copper as asquare planar geometry. In addition, an absorption spectrum ofMaL (Fig 3 c) supports our proposal that a dioxygen molecule is
bound to the trinuclear center, because the spectral values aresimilar to the reported Rhus vernicifera ‘oxygen-centered laccase
intermediate’ , where peaks at 370, 420 and 670 nm could bedetected
15–17. Furthermore, both MaL spectra in aerobic and
anaerobic conditions are similar, and some activity against gua-iacol could be measured under anaerobic condition (data notshown), also suggesting stable dioxygen binding.
Recently the crystal structure of CueO, a multicopper oxidase
required for copper homeostasis in Escherichia coli , has been
determined
18. In this structure, the distance between the type-3
coppers is 4.7 Å, close to that which was observed in MaL. Inaddition, the structure showed single oxygen-atom bindingamong all three coppers within the distances 2.3–3.1 Å. Thus,the binding geometry resembles the binding of the dioxygenmolecule in MaL. The binding of molecular oxygen between thetwo type-3 copper atoms has been reported for Limulus polyphe-
mus hemocyanin
19, but the distance between the two copper
atoms was 3.6 Å and the distances between the oxygen and thecopper atoms were 1.7–2.2 Å. Hemocyanin does not containtype-2 copper, which may be the reason for stronger bonds

604 nature structural biology • volume 9 number 8 • august 2002between the oxygen and the type-3 copper atoms. Short bond
lengths (1.8–2.0 Å) between the copper atoms and dioxygen havealso been found in many organometallic small molecule com-plexes
20. However, there is no trinuclear copper model structure
in which the mutual geometry of copper atoms would resemblethe trinuclear copper site observed in multi-copper oxidases.
Because the mutual distances of the three copper atoms in
MaL are only slightly shorter than the distances measured for thereduced form of ascorbate oxidase, the measured structure ofMaL could be at least partially reduced and, in this arrangement,is able to bind the oxygen molecule. The existence of dioxygen inthe crystal structure of MaL further suggests that this form israther stable. T o our knowledge, this is the first crystal structurethat shows the oxygen molecule bound to the trinuclear coppersite. In addition, the binding geometry is completely new.
C-terminal plug
Messerschmidt et al.12found two channels, a broad and a nar-
row, that provide access for the solvent molecules to the tri-nuclear site in ascorbate oxidase. Similar tunnels may also existin laccases. In both MaL and CcL, a narrow tunnel leading to thetype-2 copper (Cu 4) may provide access for the solvent mole-cules. In CcL, the broad tunnel, which is ∼10 Å long and leads to
one of the type-3 coppers (Cu2), is located between the tri-nuclear center and protein surface. A tunnel of similar shape andlength could, in principle, also exist in MaL; however, the struc-ture reveals a plug by the C-terminal residues Asp-Ser-Gly-Leu.The packing of C-terminus against the tunnel is extensive andthere are no water molecules between the C-terminal residuesand the residues forming the tunnel surface. In addition, the C-terminal carboxylate group makes a hydrogen bond to a sidechain of His 140, which is also bound to Cu2.
The gene sequence of MaL codes for a 623-residue poly-
peptide; however, the secreted mature protein lacks 50 residuesat the N-terminus and 14 residues at the C-terminus (L.-L.K.and M.S., unpub. results). The last 14 residues are cleaved at aconserved cleavage site, similar to other ascomycete laccases

Although the processed C-termini of these enzymes are notidentical, they have a conserved Asp-Ser-Gly-(Leu/Val/Ile)sequence preceding the cleavage site. The reason for and signifi-cance of C-terminal processing is not yet understood. Our MaLstructure suggests that the processed C-terminus may bind tothe tunnel leading to the trinuclear copper site. The C-terminalprocessing and the conserved cleavage site also suggest that C-terminal blocking might be a general feature amongascomycete laccases. The function of the tunnel is uncertain, butit could form an access route for the oxygen molecule to enterthe trinuclear copper site. The entrance of an oxygen moleculeand exit of a water molecule through this tunnel would require aconformational change in the C-terminus of MaL to open thetunnel. Moreover, the C-terminal blocking of the tunnel mightbe the reason the oxygen molecule is found in the active site ofthe MaL crystal structure. In any case, the closure of this tunnelcertainly affects the function of the trinuclear copper site.Whether this feature is possible among basidiomycete laccases,which have different C-terminal residues, is not known.Interestingly, Gelo-Pujic et al .
23have noticed that the redox
potential of the type-1 Cu of a truncated basidiomycete laccasefrom Trametes versicolor (produced in Pichia pastoris ) changed
when 11 amino acids at C-terminus were replaced with a singleCys residue. This suggests that C-terminal amino acids mighthave a role in the function of all fungal laccases.
Methods
Absorption spectroscopy. The absorption spectra were measured
with Varian Cary100 spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.). Protein con-
centration of 6.8 µM of MaL in 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.0, was used
in measurements. A vacuum was applied to the anaerobic cell andthe laccase protein solution was flushed with argon for 10 minbefore measuring the absorption spectrum at room temperature. Inaddition, dithionite (Na
2S2O2) under argon was added to the cell in
several different concentrations.
Crystallization, data collection and structure determination.
MaL was purified as described24and crystallized at 22 °C in hanging
drops by combining 2 µl of protein (concentration 6 mg ml–1in
100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7) with 2 µl of reservoir solu-
tion. The reservoir solution contained 25% (w/v) polyethylene gly-Table 2 Crystallographic data collection

0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.2. Initially, the crystals were not wellordered but the microseeding method
25gave better quality crystals.
Diffraction data were collected on a RAXIS-IIC imaging plate
detector using a Rigaku RU-200HB rotating anode source withOsmic mirror optics. The crystal was transferred into the cryoprotec-tant solution containing 25% (w/v) PMME 2000, 0.2 M lithium sul-fate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.2, and 15% (w/v) PEG 400. Thecrystal was then flash-cooled in a cold nitrogen stream at 120 K.Data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK
26.
The data processing statistics are showed in Table 2.
A molecular replacement solution was found using AMoRe27. The
search model was laccase from C. cinereus (PDB entry 1A65)28. The
asymmetric unit contained two molecules, designated A and B. Thestructure was refined by iterative cycles of manual refitting with O
29
and simulated annealing and positional refinement with CNS30. The
parameters of Quanta 3.0 (ref. 31) were used as constraints for themetal sites. The resulting map showed good connectivity through-out the polypeptide chain, and the final model had a good stereo-chemistry. Data statistics are listed in Table 2. Figures were preparedwith SETOR
32and GRASP33.
During refinement, we observed an elongated electron density
between all three copper atoms in the trinuclear copper centerand concluded that this best corresponds to a dioxygen molecule.To test whether the density corresponds to one water, hydroxyl orsingle oxygen atom occupying two positions, we refined the struc-ture with a water molecule occupying both positions by half. Thiscalculation showed clear residual electron density in the F
o– F c
map and the B-factors for the oxygen atoms were low (2–4 Å2).
This suggests that two oxygen atoms are covalently bound to eachother in the trinuclear copper center. The alternatives for this mol-ecule would be either neutral oxygen or dihydrogen peroxide. Anegatively charged hydroperoxide ion would probably make acovalent bond (2.0 Å) with one of the copper atoms, as observedin ascorbate oxidase
13. The protonation states of these two 
oxygens are difficult to determine. However, the oxygen–oxygendistance corresponds better with the dioxygen molecule, where itis 0.3 Å shorter that in dihydrogen peroxide. Therefore, we sug-gest that the molecule is the dioxygen. By using the dioxygen inthe refinement, we obtained B-factors of 19–26 Å
2for the oxygen
atoms. The molecule bound to the type-2 copper (Cu4) was reasoned to most likely be a chloride ion because the water mole-cule in this position showed a low B-factor.

Molecular Cloning and Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of a
Laccase Gene from the Ascomycete Melanocarpus albomyces
Laura-Leena Kiiskinen * and Markku Saloheimo
VTT Biotechnology, Espoo, Finland
Received 3 July 2003/Accepted 16 October 2003
The lac1 gene encoding an extracellular laccase was isolated from the thermophilic fungus Melanocarpus
albomyces . This gene has ﬁve introns, and it encodes a protein consisting of 623 amino acids. The deduced
amino acid sequence of the laccase was shown to have high homology with laccases from other ascomycetes. In
addition to removal of a putative 22-amino-acid signal sequence and a 28-residue propeptide, maturation of thetranslation product of lac1 was shown to involve cleavage of a C-terminal 14-amino-acid extension. M.
albomyces lac1 cDNA was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the inducible GAL1 promoter. Extremely
low production was obtained with the expression construct containing laccase cDNA with its own signal andpropeptide sequences. The activity levels were signiﬁcantly improved by replacing these sequences with theprepro sequence of the S. cerevisiae /H9251-factor gene. The role of the C-terminal extension in laccase production
inS. cerevisiae was also studied. Laccase production was increased sixfold with the modiﬁed cDNA that had a
stop codon after the native processing site at the C terminus.
Laccases (benzenediol:oxygen oxidoreductases; EC 1.10.3.2)
are multicopper enzymes belonging to the group of blue oxi-
dases. They catalyze the oxidation of a variety of phenoliccompounds, as well as diamines and aromatic amines, withconcomitant reduction of molecular oxygen to water (43). Lac-cases are widely distributed in higher plants and fungi, andlaccase or laccase-like activity has also been demonstrated insome insects and bacteria (18, 31, 12). In fungi, laccases areinvolved in several physiological functions, such as plant patho-genesis (3, 11), pigment production (2), and degradation oflignocellulosic materials (6). Because of their surprisingly widevariety of substrates, laccases are considered industrially inter-esting enzymes for various applications, including textile dyebleaching, pulp bleaching, detergents, and enzymatic conver-sion of chemical intermediates (47).
Despite intensive research, the molecular basis of laccase-
catalyzed reactions is still partially unknown. In order to de-termine the function of laccases and to produce them heter-ologously in large quantities, several laccase genes have beencloned, especially the genes from basidiomycetous fungi, in-cluding Phlebia radiata (39), Cryptococcus neoformans (46),
Pleurotus ostreatus (19), Trametes versicolor (25), Trametes vil-
losa (49), Pycnoporus cinnabarinus (13), and Coprinus cinereus
(48). Some laccase genes have also been cloned from ascomy-cetes, including Neurospora crassa (17), Aspergillus nidulans
(1), Podospora anserina (14), and Myceliophthora thermophila
(5). Generally, the laccase sequences of members of a fungalclass exhibit levels of amino acid identity of 50% or more,whereas the levels of identity between sequences of membersof different classes are around 30%.
Heterologous expression of laccase genes has been studied
inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (27, 10, 29), Trichoderma reesei
(38), Aspergillus oryzae (49, 5), Pichia pastoris (24, 16, 34, 7),Aspergillus sojae (22), and Aspergillus niger (36). Especially in S.
cerevisiae , reasonable expression levels have proven to be very
difﬁcult to achieve. In most previous studies of laccase expres-sion in S. cerevisiae , highly sensitive measurement methods had
to be used in order to detect laccase activity. For example,Larsson et al. reported activity measurements that were mon-itored for 24 h in order to detect satisfactory changes in ab-sorbance, even after optimization of the fermentation condi-tions for S. cerevisiae expressing a laccase from T. versicolor
(29). Reasonable laccase activity levels are essential for usingS. cerevisiae in high-throughput screening of directed evolution
experiments. P. pastoris has been used as a heterologous host
for laccases more often than S. cerevisiae , and higher produc-
tion levels have been obtained, but the results of use of thisorganism in high-throughput screening have not been favor-able because of a lower transformation frequency and integra-tion of the expression constructs. Successful use of S. cerevisiae
expressing M. thermophila laccase in directed evolution was
recently reported by Bulter et al., who obtained very promisingresults (8).
The thermophilic ascomycete Melanocarpus albomyces pro-
duces an industrially interesting laccase with substantial ther-mal stability and activity at alkaline pH values (26). Based onthe N-terminal sequence and two internal amino acid se-quences of M. albomyces laccase, this enzyme was found to be
related to other ascomycete laccases. In this paper, we describecloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding M. albo-
myces laccase. In addition, we expressed the laccase gene in S.
cerevisiae so that directed evolution studies can be performed
in the future.

Escherichia coli strains used were XL1-Blue MR and XL10-Gold from Strat-
agene (La Jolla, Calif.), TOP10F /H11032from Invitrogen, and DH5 /H9251from Gibco BRL
(Gaithersburg, Md.). The enzymes used to manipulate RNA or DNA wereobtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, Mass.) or Boehringer (Mannheim,Germany), unless otherwise stated.
Isolation of the genomic laccase gene. M. albomyces was cultivated as previ-
ously described (26). Total cellular DNA was extracted from the cells by themethod of Raeder and Broda (35). The genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI
and HindIII in two separate reactions, and the fragments were analyzed by
Southern hybridization (40). The laccase-speci ﬁc probe fragment comprised the
portion of the P. anserina lac2 gene that encodes the mature laccase protein (14).
The probe fragment was prepared by PCR from P. anserina genomic DNA
isolated with an Easy DNA kit (Invitrogen) by using primers 5 /H11032-TGCCACACT
GCCGCCAACCGTGCT-3 /H11032(forward) and 5 /H11032-GTTCTTGATATACCAATCAG
GATG-3 /H11032(reverse). The probe was radiolabeled with a random primed DNA
labeling kit (Boehringer) by using [ /H9251-
32P]dCTP. The hybridization solution con -
tained 6 /H11003SSC (1 /H11003SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7), 1 /H11003
Denhardt ’s solution (40), 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 100 /H9262go f
herring sperm DNA per ml. To test for optimal hybridization conditions forlibrary screening, hybridization was performed at four different temperatures(48, 50, 55, and 60 °C) overnight. Following incubation, the ﬁlters were washed
with 2 /H11003SSC–0.1% SDS twice at room temperature for 5 min and once at the
hybridization temperature for 30 min. The hybridization signals were detected byexposing the ﬁlters to X-ray ﬁlm at /H1100270°C.
A genomic library of M. albomyces was constructed in the SuperCos I cosmid
(Stratagene). DNA was digested partially with Sau3AI and was dephosphory-
lated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland).DNA fragments were size fractionated by 15 to 30% sucrose density gradientcentrifugation. DNA fragments that were more than 20 kb long were ligated withSuperCos I cosmid vector arms that had been digested with XbaI, dephospho-
rylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and ﬁnally digested with
Bam HI. The ligation mixture was packaged into /H9261particles with a Gigapack III
Gold packaging extract (Stratagene). The synthesized DNA library was ampli ﬁed
inE. coli XL1-Blue MR cells.
Approximately 5 /H1100310
5clones from the genomic DNA library were plated and
grown overnight and then transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes
(Schleicher & Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany), and the DNA was ﬁxed by
using standard procedures (40). The membranes were hybridized with the la-beled P. anserina lac2 gene as described above at 57 °C overnight.
Toﬁnd a suitable fragment for subcloning, the cosmids isolated from strongly
hybridizing colonies were digested with 19 different restriction enzymes, and thefragments obtained were analyzed by Southern hybridization with the labeled P.
anserina lac2 gene as described above. As a 4.5-kb EcoRI fragment was shown to
hybridize with the probe, the cosmid was digested with EcoRI, and the fragment
was puri ﬁed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The fragment was ligated into the
vector pBluescriptSK( /H11002) (Stratagene) to obtain plasmid pLLK1. The M. albo-
myces lac1 gene was sequenced from pLLK1 by using the primer walking tech-
nique with a DNA sequencing kit, the dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencingready reaction (PE Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom), and an ABIPrism 3100 Genetic Analyzer automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems,Foster City, Calif.).
cDNA cloning. The cDNA encoding the laccase was cloned by rapid ampli ﬁ-
cation of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from M. albo-
myces cells with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.), dephos-
phorylated, and reverse transcribed according to the instructions of a FirstChoiceRLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, Tex.). The 5 /H11032and 3/H11032ends of the lac1
cDNA were ampli ﬁed in two separate nested PCRs by using two gene-speci ﬁc
primers and two primers speci ﬁc for adapters ligated into the cDNA. The nested
gene-speci ﬁc primers were as follows: for the 5 /H11032end, 5 /H11032-GCCGGTGAGGATG
TAGTCGATGAT-3 /H11032(outer primer) and 5 /H11032-AGGTGACGTTGAACCAGTAG
TTGTC-3 /H11032(inner primer); and for the 3 /H11032end, 5 /H11032-CTGGTGCACTTCACGCA
GAACAA-3 /H11032(outer primer) and 5 /H11032-AGAACCACTTCCAGGTGTCGCT-3 /H11032
(inner primer). Thirty ﬁve cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C (62 °C for the 3 /H11032end) for
30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min were performed. The resulting fragments were cloned
into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (TOPO TA cloning kit; Invitrogen). The insertswere sequenced and con ﬁrmed to correspond to the laccase gene and to have no
PCR mistakes. The two separate cDNA ends were ligated into the same vectorin the correct orientation by using a unique AatII restriction site in the overlap-
ping region to obtain plasmid pLLK4.
Southern hybridization of M. albomyces genomic DNA with lac1 cDNA. In
order to demonstrate the presence of other laccase genes in the M. albomyces
genome, Southern hybridization of M. albomyces genomic DNA with M. albo-myces lac1 cDNA was performed. The DNA was digested with EcoRI,HindIII,
and PvuII in three separate reactions, and the fragments were analyzed by
Southern hybridization at three different temperatures (50, 55, and 60 °C) as
described above.
Northern hybridization of M. albomyces RNA with lac1 DNA. Total RNA was
extracted with the TRIzol reagent from a shake ﬂask culture and from a fer-
mentor culture of M. albomyces at a growth stage at which laccase activity was
produced. A 594-bp portion of the M. albomyces lac1 gene (bp 218 to 811 from
the translation start site) was used as a probe. The hybridization solution con-
tained 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS , 1 M NaCl, and 125 /H9262go f
herring sperm DNA per ml. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C overnight.
Following incubation, the ﬁlter was washed once with 5 /H11003SSPE and twice with
1/H11003SSPE –0.1% SDS for 15 min at 42 °C( 1/H11003SSPE is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M
sodium phosphate, and 1.3 mM EDTA [pH 7.4]).
Construction of expression vectors for S. cerevisiae .M. albomyces lac1 cDNA
from a SacI site 49 bp upstream of the translation start site to the polyadenyl-
ation site was cloned into the EcoRI sites of two yeast expression vectors, pYES2
(Invitrogen) containing the inducible GAL1 promoter and pAJ401 (37) contain-
ing the constitutive PGK1 promoter. This created plasmids pLLK10 and pLLK7,
respectively.
An expression vector in which the native laccase signal and propeptide se-
quences were replaced with the prepro sequence of the MF/H92511gene of S. cerevi-
siaewas constructed. A DNA fragment in which the yeast /H9251-factor prepro region
was fused with the 5 /H11032end of the mature laccase was constructed by overlap
extension PCR. The 5 /H11032end of this fragment had a 40-bp overlap with the GAL1
promoter, added to the 5 /H11032end primer. The primers used in the PCR were
5/H11032-CTACTAGCAGCTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGAATATTAAGCT
TATGAGATTTCCTTCA-3 /H11032(5/H11032end primer with an overlap with the GAL1
promoter), 5 /H11032-AGAAGGGGTATCTTTGGATAAAAGAGAGCCGACGTGC
AACACGCCGAGCA-3 /H11032(forward primer for constructing an overlap between
/H9251-factor and laccase), 5 /H11032-TGCTCGGCGTGTTGCACGTCGGCTCTCTTTTAT
CCAAAGATACCCCTTCT-3 /H11032(reverse primer for constructing an overlap be-
tween /H9251-factor and laccase), and 5 /H11032-AGCGGTACGTCCGCTGGCCG-3 /H11032(3/H11032
end primer). The plasmid was constructed by in vivo recombination in S. cerevi-
siae. Strain W3031a was transformed with the laccase expression plasmid
pLLK10 digested with HindIII and BstEII and the PCR fragment described
above which had overlaps at both ends with digested pLLK10. Plasmids were
rescued into E. coli from the yeast transformants obtained, and plasmid pMS174
was con ﬁrmed by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing.
To study the signi ﬁcance of C-terminal processing for laccase production in
yeast, a version of pMS174 was made in which a translation stop codon wasadded after the C-terminal processing site. This was done by site-directed mu-tagenesis with a QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primers 5 /H11032-CC
CAAGATCGACTCGGGCCTG TAGCGTCGCCGCTGGGTGGAGG-3 /H11032(for-
ward) and 5 /H11032-CCTCCACCCAGCGGCGACGCT ACAGGCCCGAGTCGATC
TTGGG-3 /H11032(reverse) (the mutated bases are indicated by boldface type). The
right mutation in the plasmid constructed, pMS175, was con ﬁrmed by sequenc-
ing.
S. cerevisiae strain INVSc1 was transformed with the expression vectors
pLLK7, pLLK10, pMS174, and pMS175 and the corresponding empty controlvectors by using the lithium acetate procedure (20). Production of laccase by thetransformants was ﬁrst assayed on SC-Ura plates (41) supplemented with glucose
(for transformants carrying pLLK7) or galactose (for other transformants) bysoaking the well-grown colonies on plates with 2 ml of 20 mM ABTS [2,2 /H11032-
azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate] (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mann-heim, Germany). To study laccase production in liquid cultures, three transfor-mants of each type were grown in parallel in SC-Ura medium (41) buffered to pH6 with succinate and supplemented with 2% glucose (transformants with pLLK7)or 2% raf ﬁnose (transformants with pLLK10, pMS174, or pMS175) and 0.5 mM
CuSO
4. All the shake ﬂask cultures were inoculated to obtain an initial optical
density at 600 nm of 0.2, incubated at 30 °C, and shaken at 250 rpm. After 2 days
of cultivation, cells from transformants carrying pLLK10, pMS174, or pMS175were separated by centrifugation (4,000 /H11003g, 3 min) and resuspended in the same
volume of induction medium (SC-Ura medium supplemented with 2% galactoseand 0.5 mM CuSO
4). Extracellular laccase activity was monitored daily by mea -
suring the oxidation of 5 mM ABTS in 25 mM succinate buffer (pH 4.5) at 436nm with an extinction coef ﬁcient of 29,300 M
/H110021cm/H110021(33).
The presence of laccase in yeast culture supernatants and inside the cells was
detected by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits againstthe laccase puri ﬁed from M. albomyces cultures. After 3 days of growth in the
induction medium, the cells in 1 ml of culture were collected by centrifugation(4,000 /H11003g, 3 min). The cells were lysed by intensive mixing with glass beads
(diameter, 0.45 mm; Sigma) in a 2% SDS solution containing protease inhibitors138 KIISKINEN AND SALOHEIMO A PPL.ENVIRON .M ICROBIOL .

RESULTS
Cloning and characterization of the M. albomyces lac1 gene.
Whether the P. anserina lac2 gene could be used as a laccase
probe in heterologous Southern hybridization was tested with
M. albomyces total DNA digested separately with EcoRI and
HindIII. The results showed that the P. anserina lac2 gene
hybridized with a 4.5-kb EcoRI fragment of M. albomyces
DNA at all temperatures tested (48 to 60 °C) (data not shown),
which suggested that M. albomyces had a gene with relatively
high conservation with P. anserina lac2 . Thus, P. anserina lac2
was used to screen the M. albomyces genomic DNA library that
was constructed. Several colonies that gave positive hybridiza-
tion signals were found, and cosmids from six strongly hybrid-izing colonies were isolated. The restriction fragment suitablefor subcloning the laccase gene from the cosmid was found bymapping the cosmid by digestion with 19 different restrictionenzymes, followed by Southern hybridization. A 4.5-kb EcoRI
fragment was again shown to hybridize with the labeled P.
anserina lac2 gene. This fragment was subcloned into the vec-
tor pBluescriptSK( /H11002) to obtain plasmid pLLK1, and the lac-
case gene region of the insert was sequenced. All three peptidesequences obtained previously for M. albomyces laccase (26)
were identi ﬁed in the amino acid sequence deduced from the
gene (Fig. 1), con ﬁrming that the right gene was cloned. When
the promoter region was sequenced, an EcoRI site was found
only 285 bp upstream of the translation start codon. Thus,altogether, 1,619 bp of the promoter region was sequencedfrom the cosmid instead of pLLK1. A putative TATA box(TATATAAT) was found in the promoter region at position/H11002170 bp with respect to the translation start codon.
In order to determine the intron-exon structure of the M.
albomyces lac1 gene and to facilitate heterologous expression,
the cDNA copy of the gene was cloned by RACE-PCR byusing a method that ampli ﬁed only capped mRNA molecules
from the 5 /H11032end. This enabled determination of the transcrip-
tion start site based on the 5 /H11032end fragment length. The result-
ing fragments from the RACE-PCR were 1,194 bp (5 /H11032end)
and 1,322 bp (3 /H11032end) long. The positions of ﬁve introns
(lengths, 78, 73, 87, 86, and 82 bp) (Fig. 1) in the lac1 gene
were veri ﬁed by comparing the cDNA sequence and the se-
quence of the genomic copy. The 5 /H11032end RACE fragment
suggested that there was an ACCAGG transcription start siteat bp /H11002120 from the translation start site.
Northern hybridization was performed by using a shake ﬂask
culture and a fermentor culture of M. albomyces at a growth
stage at which laccase activity was produced. Probing of theNorthern blot with a 594-bp portion of the M. albomyces lac1gene resulted in a 2.0-kb signal, which corresponded well to the
size of the cDNA isolated (Fig. 2B).
The sequence encoded by the open reading frame of the M.
albomyces lac1 gene is 623 amino acids long, which is typical for
fungal laccases. The regions involved in copper binding arewell conserved (14, 48). The amino acid sequence was com-pared to other known laccase sequences, and it exhibited highlevels of identity with other ascomycete laccase sequences (Fig.1). The levels of amino acid identity were 73% with M. ther-
mophila laccase (4), 68% with P. anserina laccase 2 (14), and
63% with N. crassa laccase (17). On the other hand, the levels
of homology with basidiomycete laccases were quite low. Forexample, the levels of identity of the M. albomyces laccase with
laccases from T. versicolor and T. villosa were 27 to 28% (25,
49), and the level of identity with C. cinereus laccase Lcc1 was
31% (48).
The ﬁrst 22 N-terminal amino acids of M. albomyces laccase
consist of a predicted signal sequence typical of eukaryoticproteins (32). The signal sequence is followed by a cleavable28-amino-acid propeptide, as shown by comparison of the de-duced amino acid sequence to the N-terminal peptide se-quence of the puri ﬁed protein (26). In addition, posttransla-
tional removal of the last 14 predicted C-terminal residues wasshown by sequencing the C terminus of the laccase puri ﬁed
from M. albomyces . Ser, Gly, and Leu were identi ﬁed as the
last three amino acids of the mature protein.
Southern blot hybridization of M. albomyces genomic DNA
with M. albomyces lac1 cDNA showed the expected strong
signals corresponding to the lac1 gene. In addition, weaker but
clearly detectable signals were observed with genomic DNAdigested with PvuII and with HindIII (Fig. 2A). PvuII digestion
resulted in one weaker signal in addition to the expected sig-nals, whereas two weaker signals were detected after HindIII
digestion. The signals were seen in hybridization experimentsdone at all temperatures tested. This indicates that there are atleast two laccase genes in the M. albomyces genome.
Heterologous expression. Four different expression vectors
were constructed for expression of M. albomyces laccase in S.
cerevisiae (Fig. 3). In two of them, the laccase cDNA was alone
under the yeast PGK1 promoter or under the GAL1 promoter
(pLLL7 and pLLK10, respectively). In the third vector, theregion encoding the mature laccase was fused with the yeast/H9251-factor prepro region (pMS174), and the rest of the laccase
cDNA was intact. The fourth vector, pMS175, had the /H9251-factor
prepro-laccase fusion and a stop codon after the C-terminalprocessing site of the laccase. All the expression plasmids andthe corresponding vectors without an insert were transformedinto yeast strain INVSc1. Production of laccase was ﬁrst as-
sayed with a plate test in which ABTS was the substrate. For-mation of a green color around yeast colonies was detectedafter overnight incubation for transformants carrying pMS175.No color changes were observed for other transformants.
Laccase production was then studied in liquid cultures
grown in synthetic complete media with 0.5 mM CuSO
4added
to support copper incorporation into the laccase. The yeaststrains in which laccase production was driven by the GAL1
promoter were ﬁrst grown in raf ﬁnose medium, and the cells
were subsequently transferred into a medium with galactose toinduce the promoter. Laccase production from the pLLK7vector with the PGK1 promoter was not detectable with anVOL. 70, 2004 MOLECULAR CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF LACCASE GENE 139
IV/3activity assay in which ABTS was the substrate. In the case of
pLLK10, very low laccase activity was detected after 2 days ofgrowth in the galactose medium. Detection of this activityrequired overnight incubation of the culture supernatant withABTS. On the other hand, the activity assay was clearly dis-turbed by some agent present in the yeast culture broth thatreduced the color of ABTS at the beginning of the activitymeasurement. This agent was produced by yeast cells in all thecultures, including controls, since the color of ABTS was notremoved by fresh culture medium. Thus, with low laccase ac-tivities, the activity assay as such did not give reliable values forproduction. We therefore attempted to obtain rough estimates

IV/4for laccase production from pLLK10 by adding known
amounts of puri ﬁedM. albomyces laccase to the activity assay
mixture together with the culture supernatant of the controlstrain. The absorbance changes observed were compared tothose of the culture supernatants of the pLLK10 strain. Theestimated level of production was around 2 pkat/ml. Thehigher laccase activities produced by the pMS174 and pMS175strains could override the effect of the reducing agent.
Expression of the M. albomyces laccase from pMS174, in
which the mature laccase was fused with the yeast /H9251-factor
signal sequence and propeptide, resulted in an approximately200-fold improvement in production compared to the produc-tion with laccase cDNA with its own signal and propeptidesequences in the same vector. The maximum laccase activity inpMS174 cultures was 0.45 nkat/ml. When the C terminus of thelaccase was removed from the expression construct (i.e.,pMS175), laccase production was further improved about six-fold to the maximum activity, 2.8 nkat/ml. The time course oflaccase production by yeast transformants is shown in Fig. 4.Laccase activity for pMS175 strains increased until day 3,whereas for pMS174 the activity was nearly maximal on theﬁrst day after induction. Continuing the cultivations for morethan 3 days did not markedly increase the laccase activity (datanot shown). Figure 4 also shows the growth of yeast transfor-mants and the control strain carrying the empty expressionplasmid pYES2 after induction of laccase expression. The con-trol strain carrying pYES2 grew slightly faster than the laccase-producing strains, indicating that laccase production resultedin stress in the cells.
The laccase produced by S. cerevisiae was studied by West-
ern blotting of samples from the culture supernatants and yeastcell lysates with polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 5). No laccasebands were detected in samples from the vector control ortransformants carrying pLLK10. A major band at about 95kDa was observed for the supernatants of transformants car-rying pMS174 or pMS175, whereas the native laccase had amolecular mass of about 80 kDa. In addition to the 95-kDaband, there was a smear of larger proteins, which indicates thatthere was heterogeneous overglycosylation by S. cerevisiae .
Two smaller bands which indicated that there was proteolyticdegradation were also detected. In the cell lysates of pMS174and pMS175 strains, the band at 95 kDa, the smear of largerproteins, and a large number of degradation products weredetected. The laccase with the C-terminal extension frompMS174 appeared to be more degraded by S. cerevisiae than
the product of the truncated laccase gene (pMS175). The su-pernatant and cell lysate samples used for Western blottingcorresponded to the same culture volume. As a major part ofthe laccase was detected inside the cells, secretion of this en-zyme appeared to be one of the steps limiting production.
DISCUSSION
A novel laccase with extremely interesting technical proper-
ties was recently isolated from the fungus M. albomyces (26).
This laccase showed good thermostability, retaining full activ-ity for 2 h at 60 °C, as well as high pH optima at a neutral pH,
both of which are unusual properties for most known fungallaccases. In this paper, we describe isolation and heterologousexpression of the laccase gene. The amino acid sequence of thelaccase was shown to exhibit high levels of homology with thesequences of laccases from other ascomycetes, such as M. ther-
mophila ,N. crassa , and P. anserina , and, as expected, low levels
of identity with the more widely studied basidiomycete lacca-ses. This ﬁnding further strengthens the hypothesis that the
fungal laccases can be separated into two divergent classes,ascomycete laccases and basidiomycete laccases (14, 5). Thelaccase of A. nidulans differs remarkably from all the other
fungal laccases, presumably re ﬂecting a functionally different
role of the laccase in the formation of conidiophores (2).

IV/5The deduced M. albomyces laccase contains nine potential
N-linked glycolysation sites (Asn-X-Thr/Ser) (Fig. 1). This pro-
tein is, in fact, highly glycosylated, since analysis of the crystalstructure of the protein showed that altogether there are sevenglycosylated sites (21). In addition to glycosylation, formationof mature M. albomyces laccase requires posttranslational re-
moval of a signal sequence, propeptide cleavage at the N ter-minus, and removal of a C-terminal extension. A C-terminaltruncation was also seen in the crystal structure of MaL as noelectron density was observed for the last 14 predicted C-terminal residues (21). This ﬁnding was also con ﬁrmed in this
study by C-terminal sequencing of the puri ﬁed laccase. Similar
C-terminal processing has also been proposed for laccasesfrom the ascomycetes N. crassa (17), P. anserina (14), and M.
thermophila (8), and the processing site Asp-Ser-Gly-Leu is
conserved in these laccases. Interestingly, the same kind ofsequence is found at the C-terminal ends of some other asco-mycete laccases with no C-terminal extensions. In the laccasesofCryphonectria parasitica (11), Botrytis cinerea (9),Glomerella
lagenarium (44), and Gaeumannomyces graminis var.tritici (30)
the last four C-terminal amino acids are Asp, Ser, Gly, andLeu/Ile/Val. We believe that this C-terminal end is conservedbecause it is related to the catalytic activity of ascomycetelaccases. In the crystal structure of M. albomyces laccase, the
last four amino acids of the protein were shown to pack tightlyinside the protein. In addition, the C-terminal carboxylate
group is hydrogen bonded to the side chain of His-140, whichis also bound to type 2 copper in the active center (21).
The maximal level of production of M. albomyces laccase in
S. cerevisiae was 2.8 nkat/ml. If the enzyme produced by yeast
had the same speci ﬁc activity as the enzyme produced by M.
albomyces , yeast cells would produce about 3 mg of laccase per
liter. Previously, substantial laccase activities in S. cerevisiae
have been detected with the laccase of Coriolus hirsutus (27) or
M. thermophila (8). For C. hirsutus laccase no data on how the
activity was measured are available. For M. thermophila lac-
case, the initial level of production obtained with the laccase
cDNA alone under a galactose-inducible promoter was low,around 0.6 U/liter, corresponding to 0.01 nkat/ml. Productionwas improved by directed evolution of the M. thermophila
laccase gene. The study of Bulter et al. (8) and our work aretheﬁrst examples of ascomycete laccase expression in S. cer-
evisiae . It is possible that laccase production in S. cerevisiae is
easier with laccases from the ascomycetous fungi, which arephylogenetically more closely related to the ascomycete S. cer-
evisiae , than with laccases from basidiomycetes.
The very low laccase activity levels obtained with a construct
having the intact native laccase cDNA were signi ﬁcantly im-
proved by replacing the native laccase signal and propeptidesequences with the S. cerevisiae /H9251-factor secretion signal se-
quence and propeptide. The prepro sequence of the MF/H92511
gene of S. cerevisiae has been used as a secretion signal in
different yeast expression systems (45, 24, 23, 34, 7), but to ourknowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that it has been used in S.
cerevisiae expressing a laccase. Use of the /H9251-factor secretion
signal and propeptide for laccase expression has previouslybeen reported only in P. pastoris , and studies with T. versicolor
lcc1 (24), P. cinnabarinus lac1 (34) and T. versicolor lccIV (7)
showed no improvement in laccase production with the /H9251-fac-
tor secretion signal and propeptide. Signal sequences are gen-erally interchangeable between eukaryotic species, and there-fore it is suspected that the propeptide cleavage step of M.
albomyces laccase is the problematic step for production of this
enzyme in yeast. In fact, the propeptide of the laccase iscleaved after Pro-Arg, but the KEX2 protease of S. cerevisiae
has been shown to cleave the propeptides speci ﬁcally after two
basic amino acids (15).
Based on the production kinetics and the Western analysis
of the yeast strains producing M. albomyces laccase, the factors

formed with pYES2 (lanes 1 and 2), pLLK10 (lanes 3 and 4), pMS174
(lanes 5 and 6), and pMS175 (lanes 7 and 8). Fifteen microliters of thesupernatant and a corresponding amount of cell lysate were loaded onthe gel. Lane 9 contained 30 ng of native M. albomyces laccase.142 KIISKINEN AND SALOHEIMO A

IV/6limiting production appear to include inef ﬁcient secretion and
proteolytic degradation. Analysis of cell lysate samples by
Western blotting showed that there were abundant multipledegradation products, and the most abundant products werealso detected outside the cells. These data also suggested thatthe C-terminal extension makes the protein more susceptibleto degradation.
The role of the C-terminal extension in heterologous laccase
production was studied by producing M. albomyces laccase in
yeast in two different forms, with and without the extension.The activity levels were about sixfold higher with the 3 /H11032-end-
truncated laccase gene. This suggests that S. cerevisiae is not
able to process the C terminus correctly or that the cleavageactivity is limiting. Our results are in contrast to the results ofBulter et al., who observed a signi ﬁcant decrease in laccase
activity with the truncated laccase mutant gene of M. ther-
mophila (8). However, it is worth noting that the M. ther-
mophila laccase gene had already gone through a series of
mutations at the time that the C-terminal point mutation wasmade, and these mutations may have affected the activity levelsobserved. Germann et al. (17) and Bulter et al. (8) have sug-gested that the C-terminal extension might be essential forproduction by inactivating the laccase during early posttrans-lational processing steps. Our data, however, do not supportthis theory.
In this work, we isolated the gene encoding a novel ascomy-
cete laccase. The recent determination of the crystal structureof this enzyme (21) makes this laccase very interesting forstudies of the basic mechanisms of oxidative enzymes. Thecrystal structure revealed some very interesting novel features,especially concerning the C-terminal end of the mature pro-tein. This study showed that the C-terminal extension is also ofspecial interest with respect to production of this enzyme. Theexpression of M. albomyces laccase in yeast established in this
work, together with the structure, should facilitate our futurestudies of the mechanism of action and improvement of thisenzyme.

Accepted 8 June 2004Previous studies on Melanocarpus albomyces laccase have shown that this enzyme is very
interesting for both basic research purposes and industrial applications. In order to obtain a reliable
and efﬁcient source for this laccase, it was produced in the ﬁlamentous fungus Trichoderma
reesei . Two approaches were used: production of a non-fused laccase and a hydrophobin–laccase
fusion protein. Both proteins were expressed in T. reesei under the cbh1 promoter, and
signiﬁcantly higher activities were obtained with the non-fused laccase in shake-ﬂask cultures
(corresponding to about 230 mg l”1). Northern blot analyses showed rather similar mRNA levels
from both expression constructs. Western analysis indicated intracellular accumulation and
degradation of the hydrophobin–laccase fusion protein, showing that production of the fusion was
limited at the post-transcriptional level. No induction of the unfolded protein response pathway
by laccase production was detected in the transformants by Northern hybridization. Themost promising transformant was grown in a fermenter in batch and fed-batch modes. The highest
production level obtained in the fed-batch culture was 920 mg l
”1. The recombinant laccase
was puriﬁed from the culture supernatant after cleaving the major contaminating protein,
cellobiohydrolase I, by papain. The recombinant and wild-type laccases were compared with regard
to substrate kinetics, molecular mass, pH optimum, thermostability, and processing of the
N- and C-termini, and they showed very similar properties.
INTRODUCTION
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are multicopper enzymes belonging
to the group of blue oxidases. They catalyse oxidation of a
wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds, including
diphenols, polyphenols, substituted phenols, diamines and
aromatic amines. One electron at a time is removed from thesubstrate by a type-1 blue copper ion and transferred to a
trinuclear copper cluster (Messerschmidt, 1997). Molecular
oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. The substrate loses a
single electron and usually forms a free radical. The unstable
radical may undergo further laccase-catalysed oxidation or
non-enzymic reactions including hydration, disproportio-
nation and polymerization (Thurston, 1994). Laccases are
common enzymes in nature, especially in plants and fungi
(Gianfreda et al ., 1999). Recently, some novel bacterial
laccases have also been reported (Martins et al., 2002; Ariaset al., 2003). The laccases most studied hitherto are of fungal
origin, especially from the class of white-rot fungi. Several
physiological roles have been proposed for fungal laccases,such as participation in plant pathogenesis, pigmentproduction and degradation of lignocellulosic materials(Thurston, 1994; Gianfreda et al., 1999).
Laccases are currently seen as highly interesting industrial
enzymes because of their wide variety of potential sub-
strates. Proposed applications for laccases include textile dyebleaching, pulp bleaching, efﬂuent detoxiﬁcation, biosen-sors and bioremediation (Gianfreda et al., 1999; Xu, 1999).
However, a serious problem often encountered with indus-trial exploitation of laccases is the low production level bythe native hosts. This problem may be overcome by heterolo-gous production of laccases in fungal hosts that are capable
of producing high amounts of extracellular enzymes,
generally Trichoderma reesei orAspergillus spp. Expression
ofPhlebia radiata laccase has previously been reported in
T. reesei (Saloheimo & Niku-Paavola, 1991), whereas lacca-
ses from Trametes villosa (Yaver et al., 1996), Mycelioph-
thora thermophila (Berka et al., 1997) and Coprinus cinereus
(Yaver et al., 1999) have been expressed in Aspergillus oryzae .

In:  Microbiology 2004. Vol. 150, pp. 3065–3074.Recently, expression in Aspergillus niger has also been repor-
ted for laccases from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus (Record et al.,
2002) and Ceriporiopsis subvermispora (Larrondo et al .,
2003). The yields of fungal laccase production have generally
been in tens of milligrams per litre.
We have previously described a novel laccase from the
thermophilic fungus Melanocarpus albomyces (Kiiskinen
et al., 2002). This laccase was shown to have very interesting
properties relating to potential industrial applications of
laccases as well as to studies on structure–function relation-
ships. Compared to many other laccases studied, M. albo-
myces laccase is more thermostable and has a higher pH
optimum, both of which are useful properties for manyapplications (Kiiskinen et al., 2002). The three-dimensional
structure of M. albomyces laccase has been solved as one of
the ﬁrst complete laccase structures (Hakulinen et al., 2002).
The crystal structure revealed novel properties of M. albo-
myces laccase concerning molecular oxygen binding to the
active site and the C-terminus entering inside the enzyme.Heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was
also recently reported for this laccase, and the results showedthat the C-terminal end of the protein is of special interestalso with respect to production of this enzyme (Kiiskinen &Saloheimo, 2004). Because these results further emphasizedthe potential of this laccase for research and industrialpurposes, we have now expressed the laccase gene in T.
reesei , a ﬁlamentous fungus that is well known for its ability
to produce high amounts of extracellular enzymes (Ma ¨ntyla¨
et al., 1998).
METHODS
Microbial strains and enzymes used for cloning. Escherichia
colistrains used for vector propagation were DH5 afrom Gibco-BRL
and TOP10F 9from Invitrogen. T. reesei RutC-30 (Montenecourt &
Eveleigh, 1979) was used as a host for laccase production. Enzymes
used to manipulate DNA or RNA were obtained from New England
Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim.
Vector construction. The T. reesei expression vector pAMH110
(Saloheimo et al., 1989) was digested with KspI and NdeI to remove
a spacer fragment between the cbh1 promoter and terminator
sequences. M. albomyces lac1 cDNA was released from the plasmid
pLLK4 (Kiiskinen & Saloheimo, 2004) by SacI and EcoRI digestion
and ligated into pAMH110 by blunt-end ligation, to obtain theplasmid pLLK8. The expression cassette for hygromycin resistanceconsisting of the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA promoter and trpC termi-
nator and the E. coli hygromycin resistance gene was taken from the
plasmid pBluekan7-1.NotI (from P. J. Punt, TNO Nutrition andFood Research, the Netherlands) by NotI digestion. It was cloned
into the EcoRI site of pLLK8 by blunt-end ligation to obtain the
ﬁnal expression plasmid pLLK13.
In order to construct a vector for production of a fusion protein
between the T. reesei hydrophobin I (HFBI) and M. albomyces laccase,
the cDNA encoding mature laccase was ampliﬁed by PCR with a
programme of 26 cycles of 94 uC for 45 s; 57 uC for 30 s; 72 uC for
2 min. The PCR primers were 5 9-ACGTAC
GGTACCGAGCCGAC-
GTGCAACACGCC-3 9(forward) and 5 9-ACGTAC GGTACCTCAAC-
GAACCAGCCACTCGC-3 9(reverse). Asp718 sites incorporated into
the primers are underlined. The PCR product was cloned intopCR2.1-TOPO-vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen) and
sequenced. As the cDNA itself contained an Asp718 site, the cDNA
was released from the vector by partial digestion with Asp718 and
ligated into the Asp718 site of the plasmid pTNS29. pTNS29 is a
pUC19-based expression vector containing the T. reesei cbh1 promoter
and a genomic copy of the hfb1 open reading frame (Nakari-Seta ¨la¨et al.,
1996), followed by an artiﬁcial linker and the cbh1 terminator
sequence. The Asp718 site of pTNS29 is located after the linker
sequence. The ﬁnal HFBI–laccase expression construct was pLLK12.
Transformation of T. reesei and screening of the transfor-
mants. T. reesei RutC-30 was transformed with linearized expres-
sion vector pLLK13 essentially as described by Penttila ¨et al. (1987).
As pLLK12 did not contain the hygromycin resistance cassette, itwas digested with SphI and StuI to release the expression cassette,
and the cassette was cotransformed with pBluekan7-1.NotI carrying
a hygromycin resistance cassette. The transformants were plated on
minimal medium (Penttila ¨et al., 1987) containing 20 g glucose l
21
and 125 mg hygromycin l21. Well-growing transformants were puri-
ﬁed to uninuclear clones by plating single spores on selectivemedium. To test for laccase production on plates, the transformantswere grown on plates with minimal medium containing 20 g lactosel
21and 125 mg hygromycin l21for 5 days. Two millilitres of
15 mM ABTS (Roche Diagnostics) in 25 mM succinate buffer(pH 4 ?5) was pipetted onto the plates and the formation of green
colour around fungal colonies was monitored visually for 2 h.Selected laccase-positive transformants were cultivated in shake-
ﬂasks in minimal medium (Penttila ¨et al., 1987) supplemented with
40 g lactose l
21, 20 g grain-based carbon and nitrogen source l21
(Suominen et al., 1993), 0 ?1 mM CuSO 4, and 10 g potassium hydro-
gen phthalate l21for buffering at pH 6. For monitoring the growth
properties of the fungi, selected transformants were also grown in a
soluble medium where the grain-based carbon and nitrogen sourcewas replaced by 2 g peptone l
21. All the cultivations were performed
at 28 uC and 200 r.p.m. The effect of copper concentration on lac-
case production was studied by cultivating selected transformants inthe minimal medium with 0 ?1, 0?5, 1, 2 or 3 mM CuSO
4.
Western, Northern and Southern blot analyses. The recombi-
nant laccase was studied by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-
bodies raised in rabbits against the native M. albomyces laccase.
Samples from culture supernatants and cell lysates of shake-ﬂask
cultures grown in the medium with lactose and grain-based nitrogenand carbon source were analysed. After 7 days of growth, the super-
natant samples and cells were collected. The cells were washed twice
with 20 mM sodium succinate buffer (pH 4 ?8), ground under liquid
nitrogen and suspended into the same buffer with protease inhibi-tors (Complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). Samples
were separated by SDS-PAGE (Mighty Small II SE250, Hoefer
Pharmacia Biotech) and proteins were electroblotted onto nitro-cellulose ﬁlters (Schleicher & Schuell). M. albomyces laccase was
detected using alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGsecondary antibody (Bio-Rad). The supernatant and cell lysatesamples analysed corresponded to the same culture volume.
Total T. reesei RNA was extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Life
Technologies). The RNA was treated with glyoxal, run in a 1 % agarose
gel (Sambrook et al ., 1989), transferred onto Hybond-N nylon
membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hydridized accordingto the manufacturer’s instructions. The ﬁlters were probed with M.
albomyces lac1 cDNA and with the pdi1 gene encoding protein
disulphide isomerase (Saloheimo et al., 1999), the bip1 encoding the
major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone (Pakula et al., 2003) and
thehac1 gene encoding the transcription factor of the unfolded protein
response (Saloheimo et al., 2003). Signal intensities were normalized
with respect to the signals of the gpd1 gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase. The Northern signals were quantiﬁed with a
Typhoon 8600 phospho/ﬂuoroimager (Molecular Dynamics).

V/2The copy number of the expression construct in positive T. reesei trans-
formants was studied by Southern hybridization. T. reesei genomic
DNA was extracted with Easy DNA Kit (Invitrogen) and hybridized
with radiolabelled M. albomyces lac1 cDNA in stringent conditions
(Sambrook et al., 1989).
Fermenter cultivations. The transformant pLLK13/295 producing
the highest level of laccase in shake-ﬂasks was cultivated in a BraunBiostat C-DCU 3 fermenter (B. Braun Biotech) in 20 litres of amedium containing (g l
21): lactose 40, peptone 4 ?0, yeast extract
1?0, KH 2PO44?0, (NH 4)2SO42?8, MgSO 4.7H 2O0?6, CaCl 2.2H 2O
0?8, CuSO 4.5H 2O0?025, and 2 ?0m l26trace elements solution l21
(Mandels & Weber, 1969). pH was adjusted to 5 ?5–6 with NH 4OH
and H 3PO4, and the cultivation temperature was 28 uC. Dissolved
oxygen level was kept above 30 % with agitation at 400–500 r.p.m.,
aeration at 2–10 litres min21and 0–20 % O 2-enrichment of incom-
ing air. Foaming was controlled by automatic addition of Struktol
J633 polyoleate antifoam agent (Schill & Seilacher). Samples were
taken daily to measure dry weight, lactose and total protein concen-
tration, laccase activity and b-1,4-endoglucanase activity. Activity of
the major cellulase cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) was also measured(Bailey & Ta ¨htiharju, 2003). In the fed-batch fermentation, lactose
was fed into the fermenter according to the algorithm described byBailey & Ta ¨htiharju (2003).
Puriﬁcation of recombinant M. albomyces laccase. The cul-
ture supernatant from the batch fermentation was ﬁrst clariﬁed byadding 10 g bentonite l
21(Steetley Bentonite and Absorbents). The
solution was mixed at 4 uC for 1 h and centrifuged at 2300 gfor
10 min. To enable the separation of recombinant M. albomyces lac-
case from the major extracellular protein CBHI, the clear culturesupernatant was treated with papain (from papaya latex, Sigma).The ratio of papain concentration to CBHI concentration was
15 : 100. The reaction was carried out in 100 mM acetate buffer
(pH 5 ?0) containing 10 mM cysteine and 2 mM EDTA at 37 uC for
2 h. After papain digestion, the solution was loaded on a Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5 617 cm; Pharmacia) equilibrated
with 600 mM Na
2SO4in 5 mM citrate buffer (pH 5 ?0). Proteins
were eluted with a linear 600–0 mM Na 2SO4gradient within four
column volumes. Laccase-containing fractions were pooled and the
buffer was changed to 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5) by gel ﬁltra-
tion through a Sephadex G-25 Coarse column (5 617 cm;
Pharmacia). Laccase was further puriﬁed by anion-exchange chro-matography with a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (5 623 cm;
Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5).Proteins were eluted with a linear 0–400 mM Na
2SO4gradient
within 2 ?5 column volumes. Active fractions were pooled, concen-
trated on an Amicon PM10 membrane (Millipore) and applied to a
Sephacryl S-100 HR gel ﬁltration column (5 682 cm; Pharmacia)
equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) contain-
ing 150 mM NaCl. Laccase-positive fractions were concentrated
and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7) with
disposable desalting columns (PD-10; Amersham).
Enzyme activity and protein concentration measurements.
Laccase activity was calculated by measuring the oxidation of 5 mMABTS in 25 mM succinate buffer (pH 4 ?5) at 436 nm and using
an absorption coefﬁcient (
e) of 29 300 M21cm21(Niku-Paavola
et al ., 1988). The kinetic parameters for puriﬁed laccase were
also measured with syringaldazine (525 nm; e65 000 M21cm21;
Leonowicz & Grzywnowicz, 1981), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (469 nm; e
49 600 M21cm21; Wariishi et al ., 1992), and guaiacol (465 nm; e
12 100 M21cm21; Paszczynski et al., 1985) in 40 mM MES/NaOH
buffer (pH 6). The Michaelis–Menten curves for determining Km
and Vmaxwere obtained with the GraphPad Prism 3.02 program
(GraphPad Software).
b-1,4-Endoglucanase activity was measured with hydroxyethylcellulose as substrate at pH 5 using a standard method (IUPAC,1987), and CBHI activity was measured according to Bailey &Ta¨htiharju (2003). Biomass dry weight was measured gravimetrically.
Lactose concentration was measured enzymically with an assay kit
(Boehringer Mannheim). Protein concentrations were determined by
the Lowry method after precipitation of proteins with an equal volumeof 10 % trichloroacetic acid. Total protein concentration duringpuriﬁcation of laccase was determined with the Bio-Rad DC Protein
Assay kit. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard in both
methods. Puriﬁcation was monitored with SDS-PAGE (12 % Tris/HClReady Gel, Bio-Rad), in which protein bands were visualized by
staining with Coomassie brilliant blue (R 350; Pharmacia).
Molecular mass, pH optimum, thermostability and redox
potential of recombinant laccase. The molecular masses of
native and recombinant M. albomyces laccases were determined by
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a Ultraﬂex time-of-ﬂight instru-
ment (BrukerDaltonics) as previously described (Palonen et al .,
2003).
The pH optimum of recombinant M. albomyces laccase was determined
in the universal McIlvaine buffer (Dawson et al., 1959) within a pH
range of 2 ?2–8?0, using guaiacol as substrate. The thermal stability of
recombinant laccase was determined by incubating the enzyme
solution (0 ?3gl21) in 85 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) at 40, 50 and
60uC. The residual enzyme activities were measured at room
temperature with ABTS or 2,6-DMP as substrates. Isoelectric focusing
was performed on an LKB 2117 Multiphor II Electrophoresis System
(LKB Pharmacia) as previously described (Kiiskinen et al., 2002). The
redox potentials of the T1 coppers of native and recombinant M.
albomyces laccases were determined by photometric copper titration in
0?1MK H 2PO4(pH 6 ?0) as described by Xu et al. (1996), using the
redox titrant couple K 3Fe(CN) 6/K4Fe(CN) 6.
RESULTS
Expression of M. albomyces laccase cDNA in
T. reesei
Two expression plasmids for laccase production in T. reesei
were constructed. In pLLK13 the full-length laccase cDNA
was alone between the cbh1 promoter and terminator,
whereas in pLLK12 the region encoding the mature laccase
was fused with the T. reesei hydrophobin gene hfb1. pLLK12
was constructed for expression from the cbh1 promoter of an
HFBI–laccase fusion protein with HFBI at the N-terminus.This was done for two reasons. Firstly, it has been shown thatfusion of a foreign protein with a secreted native protein canenhance its production (e.g. Nyysso ¨nen et al., 1993), and
secondly, HFBI as a fusion partner can facilitate the puri-ﬁcation of recombinant proteins in aqueous two-phasepuriﬁcation (Linder et al., 2001; Selber et al., 2001).
T. reesei RutC-30 was transformed with the two M. albo-
myces laccase expression vectors and transformants were
selected on plates for hygromycin resistance and puriﬁed touninuclear clones through a single-spore culture. About 40transformants that grew well on hygromycin plates wereselected for laccase production from both transformations.Laccase expression was studied by applying ABTS solutionon fungal streaks grown on plates containing selectivemedium with lactose as the sole carbon source, and laccaseactivity was observed as the appearance of green colour
http://mic.sgmjournals.org 3067Expression of Melanocarpus albomyces laccase
V/3around the streaks. Thirty laccase-positive clones were
found among pLLK13 transformants and 33 positive clonesfor pLLK12. The time of green colour appearance rangedfrom about 2 min to several hours and the best transfor-mants from both constructs gave approximately similarresults.
Several laccase-positive transformants from both expression
constructs were grown in shake-ﬂask cultures, and thelaccase activities were measured in the culture supernatants.
This activity typically peaked on the eighth day of culture.
The non-fused laccase from pLLK13 was produced in sig-niﬁcantly higher amounts than the HFBI–laccase fusionprotein The two best transformants from the non-fusionconstruct pLLK13 produced 193 (transformant 295) and160 nkat ml
21(transformant 149) and the two best trans-
formants from the fusion construct pLLK12 produced 42(transformant 89) and 26 nkat ml
21(transformant 22) of
laccase. As estimated from the speciﬁc activity of the puriﬁedlaccase produced in T. reesei , the laccase level produced by
pLLK13/295 corresponds to about 230 mg l
21.
The effect of copper concentration on laccase production byT. reesei was tested in shake-ﬂask cultivations. The results
showed that addition of Cu
2+to the T. reesei minimal
medium was beneﬁcial. Addition of 0 ?1 mM copper to the
medium improved the production levels about fourfold(data not shown). Increasing the concentration of copper upto 3 mM did not improve production levels any further. Thelaccase yields shown in this paper were obtained in mediasupplemented with 0 ?1 mM CuSO
4.
Characterization of laccase-producingtransformants
TheT. reesei transformants producing M. albomyces laccase
were characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis
with laccase antiserum. The culture supernatants of trans-
formants producing non-fused laccase showed a somewhat
heterogeneous laccase band with slightly higher molecularmass than that of native M. albomyces laccase (Fig. 1a, lanes
4 and 5). However, mass spectrometric analysis of thepuriﬁed recombinant laccase discussed below showed thatthe recombinant laccase was essentially homogeneous andhad a molecular mass very close to that of the native laccase.The different mobility of the recombinant laccase in SDS-gels could be explained by the high content of other proteinsin the T. reesei supernatant (see Fig. 1c). Western blotting
from culture supernatants of the HFBI–laccase fusion con-
struct transformants showed a minor band of the expected
fusion protein size (Fig. 1a, lanes 1 and 2). Most of theHFBI–laccase fusion protein was probably cleaved by a pro-tease between the fusion partners, as the antiserum detecteda major laccase band similar in size to that produced by thenon-fusion construct transformants. In some culture super-natant samples the fusion protein band was not detected atall, indicating total cleavage of the protein (Fig. 1b, lane 1).Analysis of the culture supernatant samples in a Coomassie-stained SDS-gel showed that the recombinant laccase wasone of the major secreted proteins in the transformants
(Fig. 1c).
Cell lysate samples of the laccase-producing transformants
were also studied by Western blotting. The efﬁciency of
laccase secretion from the T. reesei cells was investigated by
analysing supernatant and cell lysate samples correspondingto the same culture volume. For both expression constructs,
a major proportion of the recombinant protein was detected
inside the cell, but for the fusion protein the intracellular
proportion was much higher (Fig. 1b, lanes 2 and 4),
suggesting less efﬁcient secretion of this protein. Both the
HFBI–laccase fusion protein and several cleavage products
were detected in the intracellular sample of the fusion
construct pLLK12 transformant. This indicates that thefusion protein is more susceptible to intracellular protease
attack in general than the non-fused laccase.
The laccase gene copy numbers of the ﬁve best-producing
transformants from both expression constructs were studied
by Southern hybridization. All the analysed transformants
from the non-fusion construct appeared to have a single

V/4copy of the expression plasmid, whereas all the transfor-
mants derived from the fusion construct had two or threecopies (data not shown).
Northern analysis was performed from the parental strain
and the two best-producing transformants from both
constructs. These strains were grown in shake-ﬂasks in amedium inducing high laccase production, and mycelium
samples for Northern analysis were taken on the fourth, ﬁfth
and seventh day of growth. The Northerns were probed withM. albomyces laccase cDNA to determine the expression
level of the transformed constructs. In addition, possible
activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathwayby laccase expression was studied by probing the Northernswith two target genes of this signalling pathway: pdi1
encoding protein disulphide isomerase (Saloheimo et al.,
1999) and bip1 encoding the major ER chaperone (Pakula
et al., 2003). The signal intensities quantiﬁed for these genes
were normalized with respect to signal intensities of the gpd1
gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
In addition, probing with the hac1 gene encoding the UPR
transcription factor was performed. It has been shown thatunder UPR-inducing conditions a truncated hac1 mRNA is
found in the cells (Saloheimo et al., 2003).
The laccase gene probing showed mRNAs of the expected
size, derived from the two expression constructs (Fig. 2a).
Quantiﬁcation of the signals showed that the mRNA levelsobtained from the fusion construct were at the same level asthose derived from the non-fusion construct, or even at a
higher level (Fig. 2a). The pdi1 and bip1 mRNA levels did
not show major differences between the laccase-producing
strains and the control. On the fourth culture day they were
similar or lower in the transformants compared with the
parental strain and at the other time points they were slightlyhigher (Fig. 2a). The only exception was the bip1 transcript
level of the transformant pLLK12/89 on the ﬁfth day (abouttwofold difference compared to the control). The truncatedform of hac1 mRNA was not found in any of the samples
analysed. Taken together, these results show that the UPR
pathway is not induced by M. albomyces laccase production
inT. reesei .
To analyse whether the growth of T. reesei was affected by
expression of the laccase gene, a shake-ﬂask cultivation ofthe pLLK12 and pLLK13 transformants and the parental
strain was carried out in a soluble medium and mycelial dryweight was measured. Growth of the non-fusion construct
pLLK13 transformants was clearly retarded compared with
the control (Fig. 2b). Growth of the HFBI–laccase fusiontransformants appeared to be only slightly or not at all
affected. M. albomyces laccase is susceptible to low pH
(Kiiskinen et al., 2002) and thus the shake-ﬂask cultures for
which the growth curves are shown were buffered to pH 6 ?0.
This is not optimal for the growth of T. reesei . In other
cultures in which the medium was buffered to pH 5 ?5, the
laccase transformants grew equally well as the parental strain
(data not shown).Laccase production and puriﬁcation
The transformant pLLK13/295 that produced the highest
laccase activity in shake-ﬂasks was cultivated in a 20 litre
fermenter. The batch fermentation was carried out in amedium with lactose as the carbon source and 0 ?1m M
added CuSO
4to support incorporation of copper into the
laccase. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5 ?5–6
because M. albomyces laccase has been shown to be unstable
at low pH (Kiiskinen et al., 2002). Laccase production was
detectable after about 1 day of cultivation, and it continued

V/5up to the end of the fermentation. The highest activity,
250 nkat ml21, was obtained at the time when the fungus
was already autolysing, as indicated by the decrease in dryweight (Fig. 3). At this point, the fermentation had to beended due to increasing difﬁculties in foam control. Theproduction curves for cellulases were typical for this kind of
batch fermentation: the most efﬁcient cellulase production
occurred at the time when exhaustion of lactose started tolimit fungal growth (Bailey & Ta ¨htiharju, 2003).
The recently published medium-feeding method for con-tinuous cellulase production with T. reesei (Bailey &
Ta¨htiharju, 2003) was tested with the laccase-producing
transformant. In a fed-batch fermentation, lactose wasadded into the fermenter according to an algorithm thatcalculates the decrease in the rate of base addition for pH
control. It has been shown that the production of cellulases
is highest at the time when the rate of base addition requiredfor pH control starts to decrease, i.e. when the growth rate ofthe fungus is decreasing (Bailey & Ta ¨htiharju, 2003). In this
ﬁrst attempt to adapt the strategy for laccase production, thefermentation was continued for 215 h. The laccase produc-tion phase of the fermentation was signiﬁcantly prolonged,as the highest laccase activity in the culture supernatant was
measured after 169 h (data not shown). Laccase activity at
that point was 780 nkat ml
21, corresponding to about
920 mg l21.
Puriﬁcation of recombinant laccase was hindered by thepresence of high amounts of the major cellulase CBHI in the
culture supernatant. Laccase and intact CBHI could not be
separated by the chromatographic methods used becausethe isoelectric points, hydrophobicities and sizes of theseproteins were very similar. However, puriﬁcation of laccase
was successful after treating the culture supernatant with
papain. Papain cleavage altered the hydrophobic propertiesof CBHI so that it lost its binding capacity on Phenyl-Sepharose at 600 mM Na
2SO4. The activity or size of M.
albomyces laccase did not change during papain treatment,
suggesting that papain did not digest the laccase. This wasalso veriﬁed by N- and C-terminal sequencing of thepuriﬁed laccase. Both termini were similar to those of native
M. albomyces laccase (Kiiskinen & Saloheimo, 2004). After
papain digestion, CBHI and laccase were separated by
hydrophobic interaction chromatography, because laccasewas bound on Phenyl-Sepharose. It eluted as two active
peaks: the ﬁrst peak eluted at about 200 mM salt concen-tration, and the second, smaller, peak eluted with buffer. Theﬁrst laccase peak was further puriﬁed by DEAE Sepharoseanion-exchange chromatography and Sephacryl S-100 HR
gel ﬁltration. The overall puriﬁcation factor was 11 and the
recovery of activity was 40 % (Table 1).
The kinetic parameters with four different substrates were
determined for puriﬁed native and recombinant laccases.TheK
mandkcatvalues, as well as the speciﬁc activities, were
very similar for both enzymes (Table 2). The molecular
masses were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectro-metry, which gave a value of 71 ?3 kDa for the recombinant
laccase and 72 ?2 kDa for the native laccase. In isoelectric
focusing, both laccases gave one band with a pI of about 4 ?0
(data not shown). The pH optimum of the recombinant M.
albomyces laccase was determined using guaiacol as
substrate. The optimum was broad, ranging from 5 to 7,as also earlier described for the native laccase (Kiiskinen
et al., 2002). The thermal stability of the recombinant laccase
measured at 40, 50 and 60
uC was also similar to that of the
native laccase: the half-lives of both enzymes were >70 h at

DISCUSSION
The ﬁrst laccase was described in 1883 from the Japanese
lacquer tree Rhus vernicifera (Yoshida, 1883). Since then
several laccases have been studied with respect to their
biological function, substrate speciﬁcity, copper-binding
structure and industrial applications (Thurston, 1994;Gianfreda et al., 1999; Xu, 1999). Despite the long history
of laccase research, many biochemical and functionalaspects of these enzymes still remain unclear. In order tounderstand the mechanisms of substrate binding, electron-transfer reactions and the suitability of laccases for variousapplications, well-characterized model enzymes are needed.M. albomyces laccase is a very interesting enzyme for laccase
research due to its temperature and pH characteristics,suitable for industrial applications (Kiiskinen et al., 2002),
and its novel structural properties concerning oxygenbinding (Hakulinen et al., 2002). However, the production
levels of laccase by M. albomyces have been low and the
cultivations have been difﬁcult to reproduce. In order toobtain a more reliable source for this enzyme, M. albomyces
laccase cDNA was expressed in T. reesei .
M. albomyces laccase cDNA was expressed in T. reesei from
two plasmids with the strong cbh1 promoter. One of the
constructs contained the laccase cDNA alone with its ownsignal sequence and propeptide region. In the otherconstruct, the laccase cDNA region encoding the mature
enzyme was fused to the T. reesei gene encoding the
hydrophobin HFBI. Both expression constructs yielded
transformants that produced signiﬁcant laccase activities. Inshake-ﬂasks, the highest production level was 230 mg l
21
from the non-fusion construct, whereas the activity levelsfrom the fusion construct were about ﬁve times lower.Fusion to a secreted host protein has improved theheterologous production of, for example, murine Fabfragments (Nyysso ¨nenet al., 1993) and a bacterial xylanase
(Paloheimo et al., 2003) in T. reesei , but in our case this effectwas not observed. On the other hand, this was the ﬁrst timethat HFBI was used as a production carrier protein. Based on
Southern hybridization, the differences in production levelsbetween the two expression constructs did not depend on
expression construct copy numbers. The fusion construct
was expressed to higher or similar mRNA levels comparedwith the non-fusion construct, and therefore the difference
between the constructs cannot be explained by transcription
efﬁciency or mRNA stability (Fig. 2a). The cause of the
lower production with the fusion construct most probably
occurred at the post-translational level, because the fusionprotein was retained inside the cells and degraded much
more than the non-fused laccase (Fig. 1b). Two efﬁciently
secreted proteins thus did not produce a well-secretedfusion protein in this case. One reason might be the presence
of a linker sequence that might not have been optimal.
Although a laccase protein species with about the samemobility as the mature laccase was observed inside the cells,
along with multiple other degradation products, the fusion
protein might not have been proteolytically cleaved preciselyat the N-terminus of the mature laccase. This may have
predisposed the remaining laccase to proteolysis.
The addition of copper to the T. reesei minimal medium
had a positive effect on heterologous laccase production.
Because the laccase was expressed under the cbh1 promoter,
which is not activated by copper, the improved productionlevels were most probably not caused by higher transcriptionrates. In addition, no effect of copper addition on fungal
growth was detected, which implies that the higher laccase
yields may have been caused by improved folding of theactive enzyme in the presence of elevated copper concen-
trations. The ability of added copper to improve correct
folding of recombinant laccase has previously been detectedinA. nidulans andA. niger expressing a laccase from Ceripo-
riopsis subvermispora (Larrondo et al., 2003). In addition,
the importance of adequate copper levels for efﬁcient hetero-logous laccase production has been reported in S. cerevisiae ,
where the overexpression of two copper-trafﬁcking enzymesfrom Trametes versicolor led to signiﬁcantly improved
recombinant laccase yields (Uldschmid et al., 2003).

V/7the ER and induces genes involved in folding, degradation of
proteins in the ER or their further transport from thiscompartment (Mori, 2003). Heterologous proteins often donot fold as efﬁciently as native ones, and thus their produc-tion can cause induction of the UPR pathway (Saloheimoet al., 1999). The possible induction of UPR, in other words
the possible exposure of the host cells to secretion stress, bylaccase expression in T. reesei was studied by Northern
hybridization with the genes pdi1,bip1 andhac1 as probes
(Fig. 2a). The mRNAs of the UPR target genes pdi1 andbip1
were not present at elevated levels as compared with thecontrol, and the truncated form of the hac1 mRNA was not
found in any of the strains, indicating that laccase expressiondid not cause severe secretion stress in T. reesei . In the case of
the HFBI–laccase fusion strain this was somewhat unex-pected, since rather extensive intracellular accumulation ofthe protein and its degradation products was detected(Fig. 1b). A possible explanation for this result could be that
the fusion protein is not trapped in the ER but rather in
other parts of the secretory pathway, e.g. the vacuole. Thegrowth curves measured for the laccase-producing trans-formants in non-optimal pH conditions show that laccaseexpression from the non-fusion construct is somewhatharmful to the host (Fig. 2b), although no secretion stressresponse appears to be triggered in the transformant cells.The reduced growth at pH 6 could indicate that laccaseproduction causes some additional stress for the host butthis can only be seen under non-optimal growth conditions
where other stress factors are also present. Another
possibility is that the M. albomyces laccase already secreted
to the growth medium may inhibit growth at higher pHvalues, because the laccase is most active at pH values above5 (Kiiskinen et al., 2002).
It has been shown that M. albomyces laccase is processed at
both its N- and C-termini (Kiiskinen & Saloheimo, 2004).The C-terminal processing is of special interest, because thetruncated C-terminus protrudes inside the enzyme, poten-tially forming a plug to an O
2/H2O exchange tunnel leading
to the active site (Hakulinen et al., 2002). N- and C-terminal
peptide sequence analyses of the puriﬁed recombinantlaccase produced by T. reesei showed that this host is able to
perform both of the processing steps correctly. When M.
albomyces laccase was expressed in S. cerevisiae , the produc-
tion levels were enhanced both by using yeast alpha-factorprosequence in the expression construct and by introducinga stop codon into the laccase cDNA at the C-terminal pro-cessing site (Kiiskinen & Saloheimo, 2004). This indicatedindirectly that baker’s yeast was not able to perform either of
the processing steps of the laccase efﬁciently. Interestingly,
the production curve of laccase in the T. reesei batch fermen-
tation (Fig. 3) was rather different from that of cellulaseproduction, even though the laccase gene was expressedfrom the major cellulase gene cbh1 promoter. Laccase
activity in the culture supernatant increased for 40 h aftercellulase production and fungal growth had ended due toexhaustion of the carbon source. This increase in laccaselevel could be related to activation of laccase by processing atthe C-terminus. This is consistent with our ﬁnding that
laccase activity increased in T. reesei shake-ﬂask culture
supernatant samples during storage at 4
uC. The involve-
ment of proteolysis in activation of laccases has previouslybeen shown with a Pleurotus ostreatus laccase (Palmieri et al.,
2001). Another possible reason for the increase in laccase
level at the late stage of the fermentation is that some of the
laccase may have been trapped inside the cells and releasedas they started to autolyse.
Recombinant laccase was puriﬁed from the fermentation
culture supernatant of T. reesei . The separation of laccase
and the major secreted protein CBHI was achieved by
hydrophobic interaction chromatography after cleaving
the CBHI with papain. Papain cleaved CBHI between the
cellulose-binding domain and the core protein (vanTilbeurgh et al., 1986), which resulted in altered hydro-
phobic properties. Papain digestion did not change theactivity, size, or N- and C-terminal peptide sequences ofM. albomyces laccase, conﬁrming that this method was
suitable for laccase puriﬁcation. According to mass spectro-metry, the molecular mass of recombinant laccase was only0?9 kDa lower than that of native laccase, which indicates
that T. reesei glycosylated laccase to the same extent as M.
albomyces . In contrast, signiﬁcant overglycosylation was
observed when M. albomyces laccase was expressed in S.
cerevisiae (Kiiskinen & Saloheimo, 2004).
The puriﬁed recombinant laccase was biochemicallycharacterized and compared to the wild-type laccase. The
results for speciﬁc activities, pH optima, thermostabilities
and redox potentials showed that M. albomyces laccase
produced in T. reesei was similar to the native laccase. This
was further veriﬁed by kinetic analysis with four differentsubstrates. The parameters K
mand kcatfor both laccases
were very similar. When compared to other laccases, M.
albomyces laccase has a rather high Kmvalue (0 ?28 mM) for
the nonphenolic ABTS, as Kmvalues around 0 ?03–0 ?05 mM
have been observed for most fungal laccases (Xu et al., 1996;
Chefetz et al., 1998; Garzillo et al., 1998; Schneider et al.,
1999; Record et al., 2002). On the other hand, the Kmvalues
for the phenolic 2,6-DMP (0 ?005 mM) and syringaldazine
(0?003 mM) were very low, indicating that phenolic
compounds are better substrates for M. albomyces laccase
than the commonly used ABTS. This was also observedwhen the rate of electron transfer was taken into account
and the values for k
cat/Kmwere compared between different
substrates; the order of kcat/Kmwas: syringaldazine >2,6-
DMP>ABTS (Table 2). Guaiacol proved to be a poor sub-
strate for M. albomyces laccase, as its Kmvalue was as high as
0?9 mM. Relatively high Kmvalues (0 ?4–5 mM) for guaiacol
have also been measured with other fungal laccases (Chefetzet al., 1998; Garzillo et al., 1998).
Laccases have generally been rather difﬁcult to produce in
large amounts in heterologous hosts. For example, only
about 20 mg P. radiata laccase l
21was previously produced
in a fermenter cultivation of T. reesei (Saloheimo & Niku-
Paavola, 1991). In shake-ﬂasks, 19 mg Mt. thermophila
3072 Microbiology 150L.-L. Kiiskinen and others
V/8laccase l21was produced in A. oryzae (Berka et al., 1997),
and 70 mg P. cinnabarinus laccase l21inA. niger (Record
et al ., 2002). The highest reported production level of
heterologous laccase hitherto was 135 mg C. cinereus laccase
l21in a shake-ﬂask cultivation of A. oryzae (Yaver et al.,
1999). Laccase expression in the yeasts S. cerevisiae and
Pichia pastoris has resulted in signiﬁcantly lower yields than
in ﬁlamentous fungi, and the highest laccase production
levels in Pichia pastoris have been around 5–8 mg l21
(Otterbein et al., 2000; Soden et al., 2002). The production
levels reported in this work for M. albomyces laccase in T.
reesei in shake-ﬂask cultures (230 mg l21), batch fermenta-
tions (290 mg l21) and in the fed-batch fermentation
(920 mg l21) are thus the highest heterologous laccase
expression levels reported so far. Comparable laccase yieldshave previously been achieved with homologous laccaseproduction systems in a shake-ﬂask cultivation of P.
cinnabarinus which yielded 1000–1500 mg laccase l
21
(Lomascolo et al ., 2003) and a fermenter cultivation of
Trametes pubescens which yielded 700 mg laccase l21
(Galhaup et al., 2002). The wild-type M. albomyces is not
an efﬁcient laccase producer and therefore heterologousexpression of the lac1gene was required in order to obtain
high laccase amounts.
In addition to efﬁcient production in T. reesei , expression of
theM. albomyces laccase gene in S. cerevisiae has also given a
relatively good yield as compared to other laccases produced
inS. cerevisiae (Kiiskinen & Saloheimo, 2004). It is known
that proteins from organisms closely related to the host aregenerally better produced than those from more distantlyrelated organisms. Most of the laccases previously studied
originate from the white-rot basidiomycetes, whereas the
protein production hosts T. reesei ,Aspergillus sp.,P. pastoris
andS. cerevisiae are ascomycetes. Therefore, the fact that M.
albomyces is an ascomycete may be an important reason for
the good production yields of its laccase. On the other hand,the highest reported expression levels of the ascomycetousMt. thermophila laccase in A. oryzae were very modest (Berka
et al., 1997). Thus it will be interesting to follow new data on
ascomycete laccase production in ascomycetous productionhosts as results become available. In this paper we havedemonstrated a high level of expression of M. albomyces
laccase in T. reesei , providing a reliable and economical means
of producing this interesting enzyme for future studies.

Abstract A laccase from the thermophilic fungus Melanocar-
pus albomyces was shown to bind to softwood and pure
microcrystalline cellulose. The binding isotherm ﬁtted well the
Langmuir type one-site binding model. The adsorption param-eters indicated that M. albomyces laccase binds with high aﬃnity
to cellulose with a relatively low maximum binding capacity, ascompared to the values for various cellulases. The binding wasshown to be reversible and not inﬂuenced by non-speciﬁc proteinor 0.1–0.5 M Na
2SO 4. No binding was detected with laccases
from Trametes hirsuta orMauginiella sp., which suggests that
binding to cellulose is typical for only some laccases./C2112004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published

1. Introduction
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are multicopper oxidases catalyzing
oxidation of various phenolic compounds, aromatic amines,
and even certain inorganic compounds by a one-electron
transfer mechanism. The electron withdrawn from the sub-
strate is transferred via four copper atoms to molecular oxygen[1]. Laccases are very common in nature, especially in plants
and fungi [2,3]. Fungal laccases participate in plant patho-
genesis, pigment production, and lignin biodegradation [2,4].Mainly because of the broad substrate speciﬁcity range of
laccases, they possess great biotechnological potential. Prom-
ising applications for laccases include e.g., textile dye bleach-ing, pulp bleaching and bioremediation [2,5].
We have recently puriﬁed and characterized from the ther-
mophilic fungus Melanocarpus albomyces a laccase, which has
high thermostability and a pH optimum at a neutral andslightly alkaline pH range [6]. The three-dimensional structure
ofM. albomyces laccase has been solved as one of the ﬁrst
complete laccase structures including all four coppers [7]. Inthis article, a novel feature for M. albomyces laccase is dem-
onstrated: its eﬀective binding to cellulose. Binding to cellulosehas been shown for many enzymes involved in modiﬁcation of
lignocellulose, including various cellulases (for reviews, see[8,9]), hemicellulases [10–12], a b-glucosidase [13], and some
cellobiose dehydrogenases [14–17]. In addition to cellulose-binding enzymes, binding to solid substrates has been reportedwith several chitinases [18,19] and glucoamylases [20,21]. Wedemonstrate in this article for the ﬁrst time that a laccase binds
to cellulose with high aﬃnity.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Enzymes and cellulosic materials
The enzymes used in this study were: recombinant M. albomyces
laccase puriﬁed from Trichoderma reesei [22], native M. albomyces
laccase [6], Trametes hirsuta laccase [23] and Mauginiella sp. laccase
[24]. Steam-pretreated softwood (SPS) from Picea abies [25], Avicel PH
101 (SERVA Electrophoresis) and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose
(BMCC) from Acetobacter xylinum [26] were used as cellulosic
adsorbents.
2.2. Adsorption studies with steam-pretreated softwood
Laccases were added into 1 ml of 10 g l/C01steam-pretreated softwood
(SPS) suspension in 50 mM citrate buﬀer (pH 5) giving initial enzymedosages of 100 and 1000 nkat g
/C01. After gentle mixing in an end-over-
end rotary shaker at 22 /C176C for 1 h, the samples were centrifuged
(10 000 ·g,2 2/C176C, 5 min). The remaining laccase activity in the super-
natant was measured spectrophotometrically with 2,20-azinobis-(3-
ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) [ABTS, Roche Diagnostics] assubstrate [27]. All measurements described in this study were repeatedtwo to four times and the results were calculated as mean values fromthe parallel samples.
2.3. Adsorption of M. albomyces laccase on pure cellulose
Recombinant M. albomyces laccase (0.09–5 lM) was added into
0.25–1 ml of cellulose suspension containing 10 g l
/C01Avicel or 0.1 g l/C01
BMCC in 50 mM sodium citrate buﬀer (pH 5) at 22 /C176C. In order to
reduce non-speciﬁc adsorption of laccase, 0.5% of bovine serum al-bumin (BSA; Sigma) was added to the BMCC-containing reactionmixtures [28,29]. The remaining laccase activity in the supernatant wasmeasured after 1 h as described above. The corresponding proteinconcentrations were calculated by using the speciﬁc activity of 600 nkatmg
/C01(measured on ABTS in citrate buﬀer) and the molecular weight
of 71 000 Da for recombinant M. albomyces laccase [22]. The amount
of bound laccase was calculated from the diﬀerence between the initialand free enzyme concentrations. A control sample without cellulosewas also measured each time to ensure that the laccase remained activeduring the treatment. The non-linear regression curves for bindingisotherms were calculated with GraphPad Prism 3.02 program
(GraphPad Software).
The activity of bound laccase was measured with an end-point ac-
tivity assay after binding. The supernatant was removed and the cel-
lulose fraction containing the bound laccase was suspended in citratebuﬀer to restore the initial volume. The cellulose suspension was*Corresponding author. Fax: 358-9-4552103.

concentration of 5 mM [27]. The reaction was allowed to proceed forexactly 2 min, after which the solution was ﬁltrated through a 0.2 lm
sterile FP 30 ﬁlter (Scleicher and Schuell) and the absorbance at 436
nm was immediately measured.
Reversibility of binding was determined by dilution experiments.
M. albomyces laccase was ﬁrst allowed to adsorb on BMCC for 1 h.
Subsequently, the mixture was diluted ﬁvefold with the sample buﬀer.
Formation of a new equilibrium was monitored by removing small
samples from the mixture after 1, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min. The samples
were ﬁltrated through a 0.2 lm GHP ﬁlter (Scleicher and Schuell), and
the concentration of laccase at the new equilibrium was determined byactivity measurements as described above.
The eﬀect of non-speciﬁc adsorption on binding to BMCC was
studied by omitting BSA in the binding experiments and the role ofionic interactions in adsorption was analyzed by adding 0.1 or 0.5 MNa
2SO4into the reaction mixture. The adsorption of T. hirsuta laccase
on BMCC was studied at two protein concentrations (0.1 and 0.4 lM)
as described above.
3. Results
The adsorption of M. albomyces ,T. hirsuta andMauginiella
sp. laccases on steam-pretreated softwood was tested at two
enzyme concentrations, 1 and 10 nkat ml/C01. The diﬀerence in
binding between diﬀerent laccases was very obvious; only M.
albomyces laccase showed extensive binding, whereas T. hirs-
utaand Mauginiella laccases did not adsorb on softwood
(Table 1). Interestingly, SPS seemed to stabilize Mauginiella
and T. hirsuta laccases, as it prevented signiﬁcant loss of ac-
tivity that was detected in the control samples containing lowconcentrations of these laccases in buﬀer without SPS. Steam-pretreatment of softwood generates swollen wood ﬁbers con-
sisting of cellulose (42%) and lignin (51%) [25]. The stabilizing
eﬀect of SPS may be related to the exposed lignin, becausevarious lignin-derived phenolic compounds have been shownto enhance the stability of Trametes versicolor laccase in citrate
buﬀer [30]. In the case of M. albomyces laccase, the loss
of activity was not observed even in very low proteinconcentrations.
Binding of M. albomyces laccase was also analyzed on rel-
atively pure cellulose, Avicel, to elucidate whether the bindingto SPS was truly caused by cellulose present in wood ﬁbres.
The adsorption studies with 1% Avicel clearly indicated that
M. albomyces laccase was eﬀectively bound to puriﬁed cellu-
lose (Table 2). Activity of the Avicel-bound laccase was alsodetermined in order to clarify whether the bound laccase was
still active. As shown from the results (Table 2), all laccase
activity could be recovered from the Avicel fraction, indicatingthat binding does not inactivate the enzyme.
The macroscopic structure of cellulose in Avicel prepara-
tions is relatively heterogeneous [26,31], therefore more thor-ough binding analyses were conducted with bacterial
microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC). The adsorption isotherm
ofM. albomyces laccase on BMCC is shown in Fig. 1. In
comparison, the adsorption of T. hirsuta laccase was studied at
two points on the isotherm. No adsorption of T. hirsuta lac-
case occurred, since all laccase activity was detected in thesupernatant after 1 h mixing with BMCC (Fig. 1).
The data points on the binding isotherm of M. albomyces
laccase ﬁtted well the classical Langmuir-type binding modelrepresented by the Eq. (1)

max½L/C138=ðKdþ½L/C138Þ; ð1Þ
where [L] is the concentration of free enzyme in equilibrium,
Bmaxis the maximum binding capacity and Kdis the disso-
ciation constant ( ¼the reciprocal of the association constant
Ka) [32]. BmaxandKdwere solved by non-linear regression,
and the curve ﬁt yielded values of 1.94 /C60.05 lmol g/C01and
0.006 /C60.001 lM, respectively. The relative partition coeﬃ-
cient ( Kp) was calculated using the slope of the isotherm in
low enzyme concentrations. The slope was calculated fromthe ﬁrst derivative of the isotherm Eq. (1) as the concen-
tration of free enzyme approaches zero [33]. Thus, K
pwas
calculated by substituting the values for BmaxandKdinto
the Eq. (2)

enzyme concentrations than presented in Fig. 1 to ensure that
the saturation level evident in Fig. 1 was truly valid [34]. No
increase in the amount of bound enzyme per gram of cellulose
was seen with data points of up to free enzyme concentrationof 4.3 lM (data not shown). In high enzyme concentrations
(>1 lM) the random error of data points substantially in-
creased, when the relative proportion of bound enzyme versusfree enzyme decreased, as has previously been discussed byBothwell and Walker [32].
The reversibility of binding was determined by dilution
experiments. The equilibrium between laccase and cellulosewas unbalanced by adding buﬀer, and the desorption of
laccase was monitored by activity measurements of the su-
pernatant fraction. The desorption data showed that a newequilibrium was established on the same isotherm (Fig. 2).
In order to elucidate the nature of interactions aﬀecting the
adsorption of M. albomyces laccase on BMCC, the eﬀect of
non-speciﬁc protein (BSA) and ionic strength on bindingwere studied. BSA was added to the reaction mixtures in
adsorption studies to prevent non-speciﬁc adsorption of the
laccase [28,29], and the eﬀect of non-speciﬁc adsorption wasstudied by omitting BSA in the binding experiments at three
points on the isotherm. Omission of BSA did not causechanges in the adsorption behaviour of M. albomyces laccase
(Fig. 3). In addition, the eﬀect of 0.1 and 0.5 M Na
2SO4on
adsorption was studied at three points on the isotherm. The
results showed that the addition of salt did not alter theadsorption of M. albomyces laccase on BMCC (Fig. 3).
4. Discussion
The adsorption of a laccase on cellulose was demonstrated
for the ﬁrst time in this study; laccase from the ascomycete M.
albomyces was shown to eﬀectively bind to steam-pretreated
softwood, Avicel and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose.Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the cellulose-bound
laccase retained its full activity. The adsorption on cellulose
was also studied with two other fungal laccases from T. hirsuta
andMauginiella sp. The results clearly indicated that neither of
these laccases were able to bind to cellulose. These results thussuggest that laccases can be divided into two groups based ontheir aﬃnity for cellulose.
The adsorption isotherm of M. albomyces laccase on
BMCC was found to ﬁt the Langmuir model, which iscommonly used to describe the binding of cellulases to cel-lulose [35–38]. The curve ﬁtting facilitated the calculation of
the adsorption parameters for maximum binding capacity
and binding aﬃnity. The maximum binding capacity of M.
albomyces laccase (1.94 lmol g
/C01) was relatively low as
compared to the values for various cellulases with bindingcapacities for BMCC ranging from 6 to 20 lmol g
/C01[39,40].
However, similar binding capacity of 2.1 lmol g/C01has
previously been reported for a cellobiose dehydrogenasefrom Phanerochaete chrysosporium [14]. On the other hand,
the aﬃnity of M. albomyces laccase represented by the
partition coeﬃcient of 320 l g
/C01was clearly higher than
reported for cellulases. For example, the partition coeﬃ-cients of cellobiohydrolases Cel6A and Cel7A from Tricho-
derma reesei were 3.4 and 18 l g
/C01, respectively [29], and of
the cellulases CenA and Cex from Cellulomonas ﬁmi 40.5
and 33.3 l g/C01, respectively [26]. The combination of high
aﬃnity and relatively low capacity of binding suggests that
M. albomyces laccase is able to bind very eﬀectively to
BMCC, but only on relatively few binding sites.
The diﬀerences in binding parameters between cellulases and
M. albomyces laccase may be related to the absence of a cel-
lulose-binding domain (CBD) in the latter. A separate CDB,
which in most cellulases dominates the binding characteristics,cannot be located either in the amino acid sequence [41] or the
crystal structure of M. albomyces laccase [7]. In the case of
cellulases, the available structures suggested speciﬁc sites on
the protein that putatively interact with cellulose [42]. These
were subsequently conﬁrmed by experimental mutagenesis
studies, which showed that the binding of CBDs is mediated byseveral aromatic amino acids forming a planar surface on the
binding face of the domain [42,43]. An analysis of the M.
albomyces laccase structure did not, however, reveal any hy-
drophobic surface patches on the protein that could obviouslybe assigned as the cellulose-binding site. Similarly to other
laccases, the crystal structure of M. albomyces showed three
cupredoxin-like domains, none of which contained regionswith increased hydrophobicity on the outer surfaces. These
observations are consistent with the results obtained with P.

tively to cellulose but does not contain a separate CBD or any
other evident cellulose-binding substructure [14,44].
One of the assumptions in a Langmuir-type binding model is
full reversibility of adsorption. Our results from dilutionstudies of bound M. albomyces laccase showed that the bind-
ing was fully reversible, thus reinforcing the applicability of a
Langmuir-type binding model for calculating binding con-
stants from our data. Reversibility of binding is not a
straightforward issue among enzymes adsorbing on cellulose,as both reversible and irreversible binding have been demon-strated [29,35,39,45,46]. The observed irreversible binding of
cellulases may be related to their two-domain structure, be-
cause both domains participate in the binding [28,45]. Ad-sorption of M. albomyces laccase on cellulose was not aﬀected
by non-speciﬁc protein (BSA), which indicated that bindingwas not due to unspeciﬁc protein binding to solid substrate. Inaddition, the binding was unaltered by the presence of 0.1–0.5
M salt. As ionic interactions are weakened by increasing ionic
strength, it can be concluded that electrostatic forces are notthe main cause for the observed binding [46].
Interestingly, Paice et al. [47] reported a preliminary ob-
servation of Myceliophthora thermophila laccase adsorption
on Kraft pulp that is mostly composed of cellulose.Mt. thermophila laccase is highly homologous to M. alb-
omyces laccase, having a level of amino acid sequence identity
of 73% [41]. The result suggests that the adsorption on cel-lulose might be a common feature among some fungal lac-
cases. The role of the binding of M. albomyces laccase to
cellulose may be related to total hydrolysis of lignocellulose,
because M. albomyces is also known to produce several
cellulose- and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes [48,49].However, the detailed binding mechanism as well as thepossible role of the binding need to be further elucidated. Theability of a laccase to bind to cellulose might be exploited in
applications. It would be interesting, for example, to analyze
whether the dosage of the enzyme can be decreased in textileor pulp applications, when a laccase that adsorbs on cellulose
is used. On the other hand, the adsorption on inexpensive
cellulosic materials could possibly be utilized for immobili-zation and recycling purposes.

Title 
Characterization and heterologous production of a novel laccase 
from Melanocarpus albomyces  
Abstract 
Laccases are copper-containing enzymes that oxidize a variety of industrially relevant substrates. In order to fully 
exploit laccases in industrial processe s, novel laccases with high stability and activity at elevated temperatures 
and pH values are needed. This work focused on id entifying and characterizing novel fungal laccases having 
potential for the applications as well as on development of efficient production methods for laccases. 
Laccase-producing fungi were screened from various environmental samples by  plate tests, and a total of 26 
positive fungal strains were isolated. Four novel fungal la ccases were preliminarily characterized, and these 
enzymes were found to be rather typical basidiomycete laccases. 
A novel laccase fro m the ascomycete Melanocarpus albomyces  was purified and bioche mically characterized. 
Interestingly, M. albomyces  laccase showed good thermost ability and activity at neutral to alkaline pH values. 
The crystal structure of M. albomyces  laccase was resolved and the overall structure was shown to be similar 
to other blue copper oxidases. Howe ver, novel features were discovered at the active site and at the C-
terminal end of the enzyme. 
The gene encoding M. albomyces  laccase was isolated, and the amino acid sequence of the enzyme was 
shown to be about 6070% identical with  laccases from other ascomycetes. M. albomyces laccase cDNA was 
expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Very low laccase production levels were significantly improved by 
replacing the native signal and pr opeptide sequences of laccase cDNA by the prepro-sequence of the S. 
cerevisiae  α-factor gene.  
M. albomyces laccase was also expressed in the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei . The laccase was 
expressed as a non-fused laccase and as a fusion protein with the T. reesei  hydrophobin I. The unmodified 
recombinant M. albomyces  laccase was produced in a laboratory-sc ale fermentor and the production level 
reached 920 mg l-1. Recombinant M. albomyces  laccase was purified and biochemically characterized and it 
was shown to be very simi lar to the native laccase. 
M. albomyces  laccase was shown to bind to lignocellulose and purified cellulose. The adsorption parameters 
indicated that M. albomyces  laccase binds to cellulose very effici ently but with a relatively low binding 
capacity. No binding was detected w ith other laccases, which suggests th at binding to cellulose is not a 
common feature among laccases.

Characterization and heterologous
production of a novel laccase fromMelanocarpus albomyces
Laccases are copper-containing enzymes that oxidize a variety of
industrially relevant substrates. In order to fully exploit laccases in
industrial processes, novel laccases with good technical properties are
needed. This work focused on identifying and characterizing novel fungal
laccases having potential for the applications as well as on development of
efficient production methods for laccases.
A novel laccase from the ascomycete Melanocarpus albomyces  was
characterized. Interestingly, M. albomyces  laccase showed good thermo-
stability and it had a pH optimum at neutral pH. The crystal structure of M.
albomyces  laccase was resolved and the overall structure was shown to be
similar to other blue copper oxidases. The gene encoding M. albomyces
laccase was isolated and expressed heterologously in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae  and Trichoderma reesei . Finally, this work showed for the first
time that a laccase can adsorb on cellulose, as M. albomyces  laccase was
shown to bind to lignocellulose and purified cellulose.
