*Corresponding author  The cultivation of Trametes versicolor  for laccase 
production and cell growth were strongly dependent on 
experimental conditions namel y physical and chemical 
parameters as well as nutrie nt availability and inducer 
stimulation. Biomass growth was compared for a rich medium and for a defined medium in two different temperatures. The best temperature was 28ºC and the maximum specific growth rates were µ
max = 0.083 h-1 for 
the rich medium and µ max = 0.043 h-1 for the defined 
medium. It was clearly shown that laccase production is not associated with cell growth, indicating that this ligninolytic enzyme must be produced in the defined medium by a secondary metabo lism. In order to obtain 
laccase induction, addition of solid lignin, lignosulphonates, veratryl alcohol, xylidine and ethanol was tested at different concentrations. To optimise laccase activity, the combined  effect of inducer addition 
and simultaneously glucose suppression was studied. The best result for laccase induction (1240 U/L) was 
obtained with solid lignin, a by-product of pulp and paper industry and the higher laccase activity attained 
(1583 U/L) was obtained with  the combined effect of 
xylidine addition and glucose suppression.  Xavier, A.M.R.B. et al.

Lignin is the second most abundant natural polymer and 
forms a matrix surrounding the cellulose, the most 
abundant biopolymer. Since this encrusting matrix 
significantly retards microbial depolymerisation of cellulose, the degradation of lignin is a significant step in 
the global carbon cycle. Furt hermore the presence of this 
intractable polymer is an obstacle to the efficient utilisation 
of cellulose in a wide range of industrial processes (Gold 
and Alic, 1993). 
 
Basidiomycetes white-rot fungi are responsible for the most 
extensive biodegradation of lignin (Wu et al. 2005). They 
have a powerful extracellular enzymatic complex, able to depolymerize this aromatic polymer into lower molecular weight compounds (Bajpai, 2004). Metabolic activity and cell growth depend on environmental conditions and specific mechanisms of enzymatic regulation, which are very important for enzymatic production. Higher fungi are heterotrophic and sessile organisms that need to excrete digestive enzymes for absorption of organic materials as a way of surviving to environmental variations. These variations constitute one or more of a multitude of environmental signals that induce specific changes in growth and development patterns as a fungus response (Read, 1994). Degradation of lignin and, more specifically, the regulation of the production of individual ligninolytic enzymes, is a complex phenomenon (Liers et al. 2006) that needs to be studied, in order to find out the correct way to obtain efficient biotechnological applications. Biochemistry and molecular genetics of lignin  biodegradation  have been  
 
 
  
extensively researched  in recent years. Phanerochaete 
fungus (Highley and Dashek, 1998; Wang et al. 2004) and 
T. versicolor  is also very studied (Cullen, 1997). 
 T. versicolor  is a basidiomycete that produces three 
ligninolytic enzymes and it has an efficient degradation 
capacity of lignin, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a polychlorinated biphenyl mixture and a number of synthetic dyes (Tanaka et al. 1999; Novotný et al. 2004). Induction of ligninolytic enzymes expression and activity increases have been reported for copper (Collins and Dobson, 1997), xylidine (Rancaño et al. 2003) , veratryl alcohol (Dekker 
and Barbosa, 2001) and a phenolic mixture (Tavares et al. 2005). However more work must be made to define the best experimental methodology for getting an optimal ligninolytic activity. T. versicolor  or its enzymes have been 
reported to deligninify and to  bleach kraft pulp (Archibald 
et al. 1997; Tavares et al. 2004; Gamelas et al. 2005) and also to efficiently dechlorina te and decolourise bleach kraft 
pulp effluents (Selvam et al. 2002), presenting a good potential to be the base of new environmental friendly technologies for pulp and pape r industry. Recently several 
works are being done to sear ch specific mechanisms of 
enzymatic lignin oxidation by each ligninolytic enzyme particularly by laccase (Castro et al. 2003). After determining correct oxidative mechanisms industrial biocatalyses can be utilised on a wide type of applications. T. versicolor  cultures or  separated ligninolytic enzymes 
can also be used as biocatalysts on other different industrial

(Swamy and Ramsay, 1999; Amar al et al. 2004; Chander et 
al. 2004; Liu et al. 2004) and for waste-water treatments (Modi et al. 1998). 
 
Large-scale production of T. versicolor  or its ligninolytic 
enzymes would be very interesting for the oxidation of 
ligninocelulosic renewable materials. Selection of experimental conditions providing increasing ligninolytic enzymes production, more than fungi growth, is very important for industrial applications and a few studies have been done to find a good experi mental strategy (Nowak et 
al. 1998). From a practical standpoint, proposed biotechnological applications will depend on a better understanding and control of the nutritional regulation of the ligninolytic system. 
 
In this work T. versicolor  growth in different liquid media 
was quantified and growth curves are presented for 
different temperatures. Induction effect by pulp and paper 
by-products such as solid lignin and ligninosulphonates is studied and compared to those presented by different reported inducers. Glucose suppression is also analysed in order to improve laccase produc tion or activity and effect 
of combination of both, inducers addition and also glucose suppression, is evaluated for laccase industrial applications. 
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Microorganism 
 
The fungus Trametes versicolor   was obtained  from INETI  
 
 (Instituto Nacional de Engenharia e Tecnologia Industrial) culture collection. Stock cultures were maintained on Tien  and Kirk (TaK) maintenance solid medium (Tien and Kirk, 1988) at 4ºC and transferred monthly. 
 
Culture conditions for growth curves 
 
The growth curves were made in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks 
with 250 mL of liquid culture medium. Modified Trametes 
Defined Medium (TDM) (Roy and Archibald, 1993) with 9 g/L of glucose and Tween 80 (0.1%) and modified TaK medium, without agar, with 9 g/L of glucose and Tween 80 (0.1%) were used. The liquid cultures were incubated at temperatures of 28ºC and 35ºC in a rotatory shaker at 180 rpm. Inoculation was made with 0.102 ± 0.002 g of mycelium previously growth at 28ºC in Petri plates during one week. 
 
Culture conditions for laccase production 
 
Enzymatic assays were made in liquid cultures transferring 
all the mycelium from the two Petri dishes growth during one week to 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 250 mL of modified TDM. Incubation was carried out for 10 days at 
28ºC in a rotatory shaker at 180 rpm. Samples were collected every day. Different sets of experiments for laccase production were carried out:

447was   added   after  three  days  of  inoculation  and  four 
concentrations of each inducer were tested: Technical lignin from ALCELL pulping pr ocess (Repap Enterprises 
Corporation Inc., Canada) (0.04 g/L, 0.20 g/L, 0.40 g/L and 2.0 g/L) and another by-product from pulp and paper industry, ligninosulphonates (Caima Pulp Comp., Portugal) (0.034 g/L, 0.086 g/L, 0.171 g/L and 0.34 g/L) were used as laccase inducers. Other reported inducers were also tested: 
veratryl alcohol (0.050 mM, 1.0 mM, 2.0 mM and 4.0 mM); ethanol (20 and 40 g/L) and 2.5-xylidine (30 µM). 
 
(2) Laccase induction with glucose suppression: Batch tests 
with glucose suppression and the same inducers at the best concentration were carried out to study the combined effect. Glucose was suppressed on the third day by transferring the mycelium, through sterile filtration, to a new TDM medium without sugar. For xylidine was employed the following concentrations: 10 µM, 15 µM, 30 µM and 50 µM.  A control was carried out in the same conditions but without inducers and with glucose.  Analytical determinations  Laccase activity was monitored according to Ander and Messner methodology (Ander and Messner, 1998) using 2,2’-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), (ABTS) as substrate at 40ºC. The reaction mixture contained 0.4 mM ABTS in 0.05 mM citrate/0.1 mM phosphate buffer at pH 4.5 and enzymatic extract in a total 
volume of 2000 µL. Oxidation of ABTS was monitored through absorbance increase at 420 nm ( ε = 36000 M-1cm-
1). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 μM of ABTS per min. The 
laccase activities were expressed in U/L. 
 
 Quantification of glucose concentrations in the growth 
media was made using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) photometric method to oxidis e reducing sugars (Miller, 
1959) with a standard curve for glucose. 
 
The biomass concentration was determined by dry weight 
of fungal mycelium. The culture medium was vacuum-filtered through 0.45 μm glass microfibre filter (GF/C, 
Whatman, Oxon, UK). The biomass retained was washed with distilled water and dried at 100ºC to a constant weight. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Culture conditions for cell growth 
 
In order to study T. versicolor  growth some liquid cultures 
were cultivated with modified TaK medium and modified TDM medium. Both media were modified by addition of Tween 80, a surfactant that pr omotes cell wall permeability 
to improve extracellular enzymatic activity.  
T. versicolor  growth curves for modified TDM and TaK 
media at 28 and 35ºC are presented in Figure 1. The results 
show that temperature of 35ºC did not provide significant growth for any tested media. The best result was obtained with modified TaK medium at 28ºC, where the maximum specific growth rate (µ
max) was 0.083 h-1 and the maximum 
cell concentration was higher than 5.5 g/L. For modified TDM medium µ
max was nearly two fold less, 0.043 h-1, and 
the maximum cell concentration was lower than 1.2 g/L, which means a reduction of 4.5 fold. As expected, cell 
growth was higher in modified TaK medium (a rich one) than in modified TDM (a defined medium for ligninolytic enzymes production). 
 
The optimal  temperature for species  from  the same family 
can be  slightly differ ent, for  example, to P. chrysosporium

448one  of the  first   studied   white  rot  fungi,  the  optimal 
temperature was 39ºC (Tien and Kirk, 1988) and for T. 
versicolor  it was attributed a value of 28ºC (Carroad and 
Wilke, 1977). Besides temp erature, the culture media 
composition, including car bon substrates and all 
micronutrients, are determin ant for cell growth and for 
specific enzymatic production. In fact T. versicolor  did not 
produce detectable concentra tions of laccase (data not 
shown) when it was grown in very good conditions, in TaK at 28ºC and so performing primary metabolism. Eukaryotic cells have adaptive systems that allow changing their 
metabolism according to physical or chemical conditions, such as media nutritional limitations or environmental stimulation. 
 
In non-limited media, fungi primary metabolism performs 
specific protein synthesis associated with enzyme 
production and other metabolites essentially for cell growth 
and reproduction. Limited media conditions change 
metabolic pathways and nutrient depletion (nitrogen, carbon or sulphur) activates  secondary metabolisms 
(Smedsgaard and Nielsen, 2005), which will provide specific mechanisms of protei n and enzyme production for 
surviving in such conditions. 
 
Culture conditions for laccase production 
 
In order to select the best inducer concentration of solid 
lignin, lignosulphonates, veratryl alcohol, xylidine and 
ethanol, specific concentrations were studied. All the 
inducers tested in this wo rk stimulated the laccase 
production by T. versicolor  to a certain extended (Table 1). 
 
Laccase activity obtained with tw o pulp and paper industry 
by-products potential inducers namely technical lignin from ALCELL pulping and ligninosulp honates from a sulphite 
processing of pulp are shown in Table 1. Solid lignin induction has been very high and the maximum laccase activity was obtained in the concentration of 0.40 g/L (1240 U/L). In this assay the inducer was not in a liquid state what means that it was a heterogeneous experiment. For ligninosulphonates the best result was obtained with an aromatic content of 170 g/L, reaching a maximum laccase activity of 270 U/L. Ligninosulphonates have provided less interesting results when comp ared to those provided by 
lignin.  The effect of inducers like ve ratryl alcohol (Mansur et al. 
1997) and 2.5-xylidine (Couto et al. 2002; Nyanhongo et al. 2002) has already been reported for stimulate laccase production. The results obtained with veratryl alcohol are presented in Table 1. Addition of all the concentrations of veratryl  alcohol,  even  being  an endogenous metabolite of white  rot  fungi,  has  induce d   laccase activity.  The most  
   favourable concentration for laccase production was found to be 2 mM (345 U/L) but results are low when compared with those obtained with solid lignin (1240 U/L). Anyway these results are in the same magnitude as those obtained with ligninosulphonates. 
 
Results obtained with 2.5-xylidine are presented in Table 1 
and they clearly show that th e best concentration to induce 
laccase production was 30 µM, a ttaining the highest laccase 
activity of 1583 U/L. Note that the study made with 2,5-xylidine was slightly different from the others once sugar suppression has occurred at the third day.  All of these tested inducers ha ve at least one aromatic ring 
and all of them improved laccase production by T. 
versicolor  cultures. The results here obtained are in a 
different order compared to those found by Lee et al. (1999) where veratryl alcohol was the most efficient inducer. Even not being an aromatic compound, ethanol was also referred in the same  work, as being an effective 
stimulator for laccase produc tion. In the present work 
ethanol addition was also test ed but such effect was not 
found for T. versicolor  liquid cultures, as could be expected 
by traditional lethal effect of high concentrations of ethanol (40 g/L) on microbial cultures. 
 
The effect of different inducers on maximum laccase 
activity for the medium with glucose is presented in Table 
2. For xylidine a new assay (medium with glucose) is presented on the same experimental conditions of the tests with the other inducers. The best result for laccase 
induction was obtained with solid lignin which provided a 18.1-fold increase in laccase ac tivity in relation to control, 
being almost three fold higher than the best of the others. This result is economically interesting once it is a by-product of pulp and paper industry. With ligninosulphonates laccase activ ity increased only 3.2-fold 
but possibly there is a toxicity effect on fungi and process optimisation must be performed to consider the utilization of such by-product. Contrary to what happened with ligninosulphonates, with solid lignin fungi culture did not seem to be affected by t oxicity, possibly because this 
material is a non-soluble solid (powder), avoiding a deep contact between fungi culture and this lignin. 
 
Experimental tests were performed for all inducers in the 
selected concentrations si multaneously with glucose 
suppression to study the combin ed effect of both inducer 
addition and glucose suppressio n. Results are presented in 
Table 2. 
 
The comparison of the results  clearly shows that the 
combined effect of  inducer addition  and carbon limitation 
developed  different  fungus  be haviour  for each inducer  in  
   Xavier, A.M.R.B. et al.  
449study (Table 2). Definitely even without any inducer, 
comparing to control, it is shown that carbon limitation alone was enough to increase laccase production from 65 U/L to 376 U/L what means an increase nearly of 311 U/L. 
These results also show that high laccase activities only initiate at third-forth day and not during exponential growth phase (data not shown) suggesting that the fungus produces laccase by a secondary metabolism. 
 
Solid lignin addition after carbon suppression provided a 
lower value of laccase activity (1174 U/L) when compared 
to induction without glucose suppression (1240 U/L). Although when compared to  respective control with 
glucose suppression it is clear that solid lignin still provides a high inducer effect that corre sponds to an increase of 798 
U/L of laccase activity. Anyway  the combination of both 
effects is less effective than the sum of single ones (Table 2). Perhaps in glucose presence and simultaneously in presence of such concentration of solid lignin T. versicolor  
can activate laccase production but after glucose suppression its capacity to activate such mechanism is 
reduced. 
 
Ligninosulphonates addition on glucose suppressed cultures 
of T. versicolor  did not provide an increase but a decrease 
on laccase activity what means that in this situation no 
induction was detected but in opposite inhibition of laccase 
production was occurred. Certainly in presence of glucose, T. versicolor  can be strong enough to tolerate this specific 
concentration of ligninosulphonates being effective on laccase induction. Besides that, it has the capacity of reacting to the presence of ligninosulphonates being induced and promoting laccase production. Haars and Hüttermann (1983) refer that the surface of fungal hyphae 
contains specific receptors for phenolic compounds and 
these induction mechanisms cer tainly could be the answer 
for that. 
 
Addition of veratryl alcohol to fungus culture after glucose 
suppression provided more 765 U/L of laccase relatively to that one without glucose suppression. This fact shows that the combination of both effects provides a best performance (1110 U/L) than the sum of the single effects (721 U/L). 
For xylidine addition and considering the combined effects, the increase in laccase maximu m has been the higher one 
rising laccase from 405 U/L to  1583 U/L corresponding to 
an increase of 1178 U/L.  When fungi are submitted to nutrient exhaustion, like carbon limitation, they can survive for short periods using their reserve compounds but essentially if they are able to use their own potential capacities, such as activating target metabolic alternative pathways associated with new enzymatic production patterns that will allow it to change to different nutritional font s according to environmental 
availabilities. This work clearly shows that these by-products of pulp and 
paper industry promote large increases in laccase production that can be an experimental support for potential  application of T. versicolor  cultures on pulp and paper and 
textile industry, for phenolic content reduction or even for soils bioremediation.
