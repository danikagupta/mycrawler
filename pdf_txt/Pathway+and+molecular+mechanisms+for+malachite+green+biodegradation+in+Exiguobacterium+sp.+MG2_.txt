Abstract: An anaerobic sludge (AS), capable of decolorizing a variety of synthetic dyes, was acclimated
and is reported here. The sludge presented a much better dye decolorizing ability than that of
different individual strains. A broad spectrum of dyes could be decolorized by the sludge. Continuous
decolorization tests showed that the sludge exhibited the ability to decolorize repeated additions of
dye. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate of the dye wastewater reached 52% after 12 h
of incubation. Polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE)
proﬁles revealed that the microbial community changed as a result of varying initial concentrations of
dyes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that microbial populations in the sludge belonged to the phyla
Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroﬂexi and Proteobacteria. The degradation products
of the three types of dye were identiﬁed. For azo dyes, the anaerobic sludge converted Methyl Orange
toN,N-dimethylbenzene-1,4-diamine and 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid; for triphenylmethane
dyes, after Malachite Green was decolorized, the analyzed products were found to be a mixture
ofN,N-dimethylbenzenamine, 3-dimethyl-aminophenol and 4-dimethylaminobenzophenone;
for anthraquinone dyes, two products (acetophenone and 2-methylbenzoic acid) were observed
after Reactive Blue 19 decolorization. Together, these results suggest that the anaerobic sludge has
promising potential for use in the treatment of industrial wastewater containing various types of dyes.

1. Introduction
Synthetic dyes, classiﬁed on the basis of their chromophores as azo, anthraquinone,
triphenylmethane and heterocyclic dyes, have been extensively used in the textile, printing, paper,
cosmetics and food industries. Annually, approximately 2.8 105t of textile wastewater with dyes is
discharged into the environment worldwide [ 1]. These dyes are considered to be relatively persistent
pollutants because they are extremely stable when exposed to light and aerobic conditions. Moreover,
most dyes are toxic, and their transformation products are carcinogenic and mutagenic [ 2]. Thus,
dye wastes must be treated before they are released into the environment.
Decolorization of industrial dyes can be achieved through physico-chemical methods, such as
adsorption, coagulation, precipitation and chemical oxidation. However, these methods have not been
widely applied because of their low efﬁciency, high cost and intensive energy requirements. In recent
years, many new processes for dye decolorization have been developed. One promising strategy is to
use microbes to decolorize dyes. The biodegradation of dyes is considered to be an environmentally
friendly and cost-effective option [3].

At present, a number of studies have focused on the utilization of bacteria to decolorize synthetic
dyes. Bacteria are capable of reducing azo dyes under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions;
such bacteria, include obligate anaerobes such as Clostridium sp. [ 4], facultative anaerobes such
asEnterobacter sp. and Escherichia sp. [ 5,6] and some aerobes such as Pseudomonas sp. [ 7]. Similarly,
several phylogenetically diverse bacteria, such as Shewanella sp.,Citrobacter sp. and Staphylococcus sp.,
can decolorize anthraquinone or triphenylmethane dyes [ 8–10]. Although synthetic dyes can be
decolorized by different microorganisms, there is little information about a single stain that is able to
reduce a broad range of dyes. Thus, the use of a speciﬁc strain on dye decolorization is not practical
in treating textile wastewater. It has been reported that treatment systems with mixed microbial
populations are more effective in decolorization of different dyes than those with single strains.
After acclimatization, the mixed cultures, which are composed of stable microbial pellets, may have
a strong ability to decolorize synthetic dyes. Moreover, the high microbial diversity and the synergistic
metabolic activities of the mixed consortia promote a higher degree of dye decolorization. Therefore,
an acclimated microbial community is a more appropriate and efﬁcient approach to the decolorization
of different types of dyes.
In this study, we report the investigation of a novel anaerobic sludge capable of decolorizing
several classes of textile dyes. To obtain more details about the anaerobic decolorization process,
the decolorization characteristics were studied. The dynamic composition of the microbial community
of the anaerobic sludge was assessed by PCR-DGGE. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were used to determine the intermediate
products after dye decolorization. All the results showed that the anaerobic sludge has a high ability to
decolorize azo, anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes and has a favorable potential for treatment
of textile wastewater.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Dyes and Chemicals
Three typical synthetic dyes (Methyl Orange, Reactive Blue 19 and Malachite Green) were used
for the anaerobic sludge acclimation. Fifteen dyes (containing ﬁve each of azo, anthraquinone and
triphenylmethane dyes) were used to monitor the decolorization abilities of the developed anaerobic
sludge. All of the dyes were procured from the Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin,
China). The speciﬁcations of each dye are given in Table 1. The rTaq DNA polymerase, PCR puriﬁcation
kit, pMD-18T vector and E. coli JM109 were purchased from TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Dalian,
China). All other chemicals were of analytical grade or the highest quality.

Anaerobic sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester located at the Wenchang wastewater
treatment plant in Harbin (Heilongjiang Province, China). The sludge was originally developed
for treatment of a largely domestic efﬂuent. A basal medium of the following composition was
used: 5 gL 1glucose, 2 gL 1NH 4Cl, 1.5 gL 1Na2HPO 4, 1 gL 1MgSO 47H2O, 0.5 gL 1KCl.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016 ,13, 1053 5 of 18
The anaerobic reactor used in this study was a PVC vessel with a capacity of 10 L, equipped with
a mechanical stirrer to provide a stable mixture of substrate and sludge. The initial sludge concentration
was 5 g mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) per liter. The temperature was kept at 25C and the
pH was maintained at 7.0. During the operation process, the dissolved oxygen concentration (DO)
was controlled to between 0–0.3 mg L 1.
2.3. Experimental Setup and Operation
The anaerobic reactors was operated in successive 24 h cycles consisted of a ﬁlling phase of
30 min, a reaction phase of 21.5 h, a settling phase of 1 h, a draw phase of 45 min and an idle time of
15 min. To acclimatize the sludge, the reactor was initially operated with dye-free medium for one
month. Then during ten days, medium containing fresh dye was added into the reactor (containing
50 mgL 1Methyl Orange, Reactive Blue 19 and Malachite Green, respectively). During the next ﬁfty
days, the dye concentration was gradually increased to 300 mg L 1for the three dyes mentioned
above (increasing 50 mg L 1of each dye for every ten days). After the stabilization of the feed solution,
the reactors were operated for 30 days. Sludge samples were collected at the last operation day for
each dye concentrations (0–300 mg L 1). The pellets were washed twice with 50 mmol L 1phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0) and stored at  20C for molecular analysis.
2.4. Semi-Continuous Study
After sludge acclimatization, a semi-continuous decolorization test was conducted to indicate
whether long-term degradation of dyes could be stably attained. The system was operated at
a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 24 h which we mentioned above. The anaerobic system was fed
with 100 mgL 1of Methyl Orange, Reactive Blue 19 and Malachite Green for ten days, respectively.
The decolorization rate for each dye was measured. During the treatment process, wastewater
containing 100 mg L 1Methyl Orange, Reactive Blue 19 and Malachite Green was incubated with the
sludge to detect the COD removal rate.

2.5.1. Decolorization of Different Dyes by the Anaerobic Sludge
Batch tests were conducted to determine if the anaerobic sludge had the ability to decolorize
synthetic dyes with different chemical structures. Serum bottles (70 mL) were ﬁlled with 50 mL of
distilled water with the a dye concentration of 100 mg L 1. The bottles were ﬂushed with nitrogen gas
for 10 min to remove oxygen and sealed with rubber stoppers. Each bottle was inoculated with 150 mg
(cell dry weight) of anaerobic sludge. The bottles were incubated in a temperature-controlled cabinet
maintained at 37C. Decolorization assays were carried out after a 12 h incubation. All assays were
performed in triplicate.
2.5.2. Individual Strains vs. Anaerobic Sludge
Three individual strains ( Escherichia coli CD-2, Klebsiella pneumoniae Y3 and Bacillus subtilis WD23)
and their mixtures were used for the decolorization comparison with the anaerobic sludge. Methyl
Orange, Reactive Blue 19 and Malachite Green were chosen as model dyes for azo, anthraquinone
and triphenylmethane dyes, respectively. All three strains were isolated by us from environmental
samples and were proven in our previous studies to have the ability to decolorize dyes with different
structures [11–13].
The three pure cultures were grown aerobically until the OD 600reached 1.2. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation (10,000 g, 3 min), washed twice with sodium phosphate buffer (50 mmol L 1, pH 7.0),
transferred to serum bottles and resuspended in 50 mL distilled water to 3 g L 1(cell dry weight).
Moreover, the three strains were mixed equally to make a microbial consortium. Bottles which were
inoculated with 3 g L 1mixed culture and anaerobic sludge are also used in the decolorizationInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016 ,13, 1053 6 of 18
tests. Decolorization studies were started by addition of 100 mg L 1different dyes under anaerobic
conditions. Decolorization assays were carried out after a 12 h incubation. All assays were performed
in triplicate.
2.6. Analytical Methods
The developed sludge was used to monitor the decolorization of different types of dyes
under anaerobic conditions. Samples were taken at different time intervals and analyzed for dye
decolorization. The dye decolorization rate was estimated by measuring the absorbance at the
respective maxof the different dyes with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-2800, Unico Instruments Co.,
Ltd., Shanghai, China). The decolorizing activity was calculated using the following equation:
Decolorization rate (%) =(Ai Af)
Ai100% (1)
where Ai= initial absorbance of dyes, Af= absorbance of dyes after decolorization. COD and MLSS
analyses were carried out according to the methods outlined in the Standard Methods for Examination
of Water and Wastewater [14].
2.7. Enzymatic Assay
The sludge sample was washed twice with 50 mmol L 1phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The sample
was resuspended in 10 mL of the same buffer. Cells were disrupted by sonication at 4C (5 s,
80% output, 50). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 g. The supernatant
was used as the crude enzyme.
The azoreductase activity assay system comprised 50 mmol L 1phosphate buffer (pH 7.0),
100molL 1NADH, 50 molL 1Methyl Orange, and a suitable amount of crude enzyme.
The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADH. Azoreductase activity was detected by following
the disappearance of Methyl Orange at its maximum wavelength.
2.8. PCR-DGGE Analysis
2.8.1. DNA Extraction and PCR Ampliﬁcation of the 16S rDNA V3 Region
Sludge samples that acclimated at different periods were collected by centrifugation at
6000 gmin 1for 10 min. Genomic DNA was extracted according to the method described by
Lakay et al. [ 15]. PCR ampliﬁcation was performed using the forward primer F357-GC(50-CGCCCGCC
GCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-30) and reverse
primer R518 (50-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-30). The PCR ampliﬁcation included initial denaturation
at 94C for 5 min; 10 cycles of 94C for 1 min; 60C for 1 min and 1 min at 72C and 20 cycles of
1 min at 94C; 1 min at 50C and 1 min at 72C followed by a ﬁnal extension of 10 min at 72C.
The ampliﬁed PCR products were visualized using 1% (w/v) agarose gel-electrophoresis.
2.8.2. DGGE Analysis
DGGE was performed using a Dcode universal mutation detection system (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules,
CA, USA). Samples containing approximately equal amounts of PCR ampliﬁcation products were
loaded on a 10% poly-acrylamide gel in TAE buffer with a denaturing gradient ranging from 30% to 60%
of the denaturant (denaturation of 100% corresponded to 7 mol L 1urea and 40% (v/v) formamide).
DGGE was performed at 60C with a constant voltage of 160 V for 6 h, by using a gradient delivery
system (Model 475, Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA, USA. The gel was then stained by AgNO 3and the
images of the gel were captured by a bio-image system (Bio-Rad).
DGGE proﬁles were analyzed using the software Quantity One 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules,
CA, USA). Dendrograms relating band pattern similarities were automatically calculated using the
unweighted pair group method with the arithmetic average (UPGMA) clustering algorithm. UPGMA
employs a sequential clustering algorithm, in which local topological relationships are identiﬁed inInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016 ,13, 1053 7 of 18
order of similarity, and the phylogenetic tree is built in a stepwise manner. Relative band densities,
which were necessary to determine the Shannon diversity index (SDI), were quantiﬁed, and the
statistical data were exported for further SDI analyses.
2.8.3. Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis
Bands of interest were cut out from the DGGE gel, mixed with 20 mL of deionized water, and
incubated at 50C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 7000 gfor 3 min, the supernatant was collected and
used as a PCR template. The DNA fragment was reampliﬁed using the primers R518 and F357 without
GC-clamps. The ampliﬁcation process was as follows: initial denaturation at 94C for 3 min and
30 cycles of denaturation at 94C for 30 s, annealing at 54C for 1 min and extension at 72C for 30 s,
followed by a ﬁnal extension at 72C for 10 min. The PCR products were puriﬁed with a gel extraction
kit and cloned into E. coli plasmids for sequencing with a PMD 18-T cloning kit, per the manufacturer’s
instructions. The DNA sequences were determined using the chain-termination method with an ABI
3730 DNA sequencer by a commercial service provided by Shanghai Shangon Biological Technology
Company (Shanghai, China). Analysis of the sequences consisted of BLAST searches that were used to
identify the closest related species within the database.
2.9. Analysis of Metabolites Formed after Decolorization of Three Types of Dye
2.9.1. Samples Preparation
One hundred mgL 1of Methyl Orange, Reactive Blue 19 and Malachite Green were incubated
with the anaerobic sludge for 24 h, respectively. After decolorization, the degradation mixtures of three
types of dye were centrifuged at 6000 gfor 10 min. The metabolites in the supernatants were extracted
with an equal volume of ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous Na 2SO4and evaporated to dryness in
a rotary evaporator. The ﬁnal extracts were dissolved in a small volume of methyl alcohol and then
ﬁltered through a 0.22 m membrane.
2.9.2. GC-MS Analysis
GC-MS analysis of metabolites was performed using an HP-5MS column on a GC/MS system
(7800A-7900B; Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas at
a ﬂow rate of 1 mL min 1. The injector temperature was maintained at 280C with oven conditions as
follows: 60C kept constant for 2 min, increased up to 280C at 10C min 1. The compounds were
identiﬁed on the basis of mass spectra and the NIST library.
2.9.3. LC-MS Analysis
LC-MS analysis was performed using a Thermo LC-MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham,
MA, USA). A capillary column Terra C-18 (5 m100 mm length) was used for separation of product
intermediates. The mobile phase was a mixture of methyl alcohol and water (50:50, v/v) ﬁltered
through a Millipore syringe ﬁlter of 0.22 m. The ﬂow rate of eluent was 0.8 mL min 1, and the
injection volume was 20 L. MS analysis was performed on a mass spectrometer, and the parameters
were as follows: spray voltage, 3.5 kV; capillary temperature, 325C; capillary voltage, 50 V , tube lens
120 V . The mass range was 50–600 m/z.
3. Results
3.1. Decolorization Studies
3.1.1. Decolorization of Different Dyes by the Anaerobic Sludge
Decolorization of various azo, anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes by the anaerobic sludge
is shown in Figure 1. The sludge showed a higher decolorization rate for azo dyes, compared withInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016 ,13, 1053 8 of 18
anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes. In the case of the azo dyes tested, the sludge exhibited the
highest decolorization rate against Methyl Orange. More than 90% of Methyl Orange was decolorized
after an 8 h incubation, and the dye was nearly completely decolorized within 12 h.

the anaerobic sludge. ( A) azo dyes; ( B) anthraquinone dyes; ( C): triphenylmethane dyes. 
All other azo dyes were also decolorized effect ively by the anaerobic sludge. However, when 
we used Methyl Orange as the electron acceptor substrate, none of azoreductase activity could be 
detected in the cytoplasmic extracts. The ability of the sludge to decolorize anthraquinone and 
triphenylmethane dyes was also tested. The re sults showed that the maximum percentage of 
decolorization and the decolorization time varied among the different dyes. For anthraquinone 
dyes, almost 100% of Disperse Red 11 was decolori zed during incubation, and over 80% of Disperse 
Blue 14, Alizarin Red S and Reactive Blue 19 were decolorized within 12 h. However, only 30% of Bromamine Acid was decolorized within 12 h. Fo r triphenylmethane dyes , the anaerobic sludge 
decolorized most of the Malachite Green, Coomassie Brilliant Blue, Methyl Violet and Basic Violet 14 in a short time. However, Fast Green FCF was resistant to biodegradation, and only a 15% decolorization rate was achieved after a 12 h incubation. 
3.1.2. Individual Strains vs. the Anaerobic Sludge 
Decolorization of model dyes with individual strains and mixed cultures as well as with 
anaerobic sludge was studied and the results are report ed in Figure 2. After a 12 h of incubation, the 
sludge effective decolorized the three dyes, and the decolorization rates for Methyl Orange, Reactive Blue 19 and Malachite Green were 99%, 80% and 92%, respectively. K. pneumoniae  Y3 and 
E. coli  CD-2 had poor ability to decolorize Methyl Orange in a short time; only 25% and 5% of the 
dye, respectively, was decolorized during the incubation time. B. subtilis WD23 decolorized 75% of 
the Malachite Green within 12 h. However, less th an 50% of the Methyl Orange and Reactive Blue 
19 were decolorized during the treatment process. In this stud y, the three strains were mixed 
equally to make a microbial consortium. However, the decolorization rate of the mixed culture was 
not significantly higher by comparison with the th ree individual strains. We observed that 61% of 
Malachite Green could be decolorized within 12 h by the mixed culture. However, for Methyl Orange and Reactive Blue 19, only 29% and 34% decolorization rate was attained within 12 h, respectively. The results proved that the anaerobic sludge exhibited a high decolorization efficiency 
to the three types of dye. After the incubation, al l the test dyes could be decolorized over 80%. 
However, none of the individual strains or the microbial consortium had a high decolorization 
efficiency for all three dyes. These results show ed that the dye decolorization ability of the 
anaerobic sludge was much better than that of the individual strains.

All other azo dyes were also decolorized effectively by the anaerobic sludge. However, when we
used Methyl Orange as the electron acceptor substrate, none of azoreductase activity could be detected
in the cytoplasmic extracts. The ability of the sludge to decolorize anthraquinone and triphenylmethane
dyes was also tested. The results showed that the maximum percentage of decolorization and the

Disperse Red 11 was decolorized during incubation, and over 80% of Disperse Blue 14, Alizarin
Red S and Reactive Blue 19 were decolorized within 12 h. However, only 30% of Bromamine Acid was
decolorized within 12 h. For triphenylmethane dyes, the anaerobic sludge decolorized most of the
Malachite Green, Coomassie Brilliant Blue, Methyl Violet and Basic Violet 14 in a short time. However,
Fast Green FCF was resistant to biodegradation, and only a 15% decolorization rate was achieved after
a 12 h incubation.
3.1.2. Individual Strains vs. the Anaerobic Sludge
Decolorization of model dyes with individual strains and mixed cultures as well as with anaerobic
sludge was studied and the results are reported in Figure 2. After a 12 h of incubation, the sludge
effective decolorized the three dyes, and the decolorization rates for Methyl Orange, Reactive Blue 19
and Malachite Green were 99%, 80% and 92%, respectively. K. pneumoniae Y3 and E. coli CD-2 had
poor ability to decolorize Methyl Orange in a short time; only 25% and 5% of the dye, respectively,
was decolorized during the incubation time. B. subtilis WD23 decolorized 75% of the Malachite Green
within 12 h. However, less than 50% of the Methyl Orange and Reactive Blue 19 were decolorized
during the treatment process. In this study, the three strains were mixed equally to make a microbial
consortium. However, the decolorization rate of the mixed culture was not signiﬁcantly higher by
comparison with the three individual strains. We observed that 61% of Malachite Green could be
decolorized within 12 h by the mixed culture. However, for Methyl Orange and Reactive Blue 19,
only 29% and 34% decolorization rate was attained within 12 h, respectively. The results proved that
the anaerobic sludge exhibited a high decolorization efﬁciency to the three types of dye. After the
incubation, all the test dyes could be decolorized over 80%. However, none of the individual strains
or the microbial consortium had a high decolorization efﬁciency for all three dyes. These results
showed that the dye decolorization ability of the anaerobic sludge was much better than that of the
individual strains.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016 ,13, 1053 9 of 18

3.1.3. Decolorization of Dyes by the Anaerobic Sludge under Semi-Continuous Conditions 
In this study, the anaerobic reactor was fed 100 mg·L-1 of Methyl Orange, Reactive Blue 19 and 
Malachite Green for ten days, respectively. The deco lorization rate of the three dyes was detected 
during the entire operation process, and the result s are shown in Table 2. The results indicated that 
it was feasible to achieve highly efficient co ntinuous decolorization of Methyl Orange and 
Malachite Green by decolorization with the anaero bic sludge. The decolorization rates of the two 
dyes were maintained at up to 95% and 89%, resp ectively. Moreover, no marked differences in the 
decolorization efficiency were found during the entire operation process. Despite showing minor 
instability, the anaerobic sludge decolorized more than 60% of Reactive Blue 19 in every treatment cycle. The anaerobic sludge exhibited an ability to decolorize repeated additions of dye, thus 
showing that it can be used in multiple cycles of decolorization.

The COD removal rate was detected during the wastewater treatment process. As shown in 
Figure 3, the COD removal efficiency was high at the beginning of the reaction. After 6 h, the COD 
decreased from 1150 to 618 mg·L−1, and the removal rate was approximately 46%. However, the 
COD was nearly unchanged in the second 6 h incubation. Finally, the COD decreased to 555 mg·L−1 
after a 12 h incubation, and a longer treatment process did not produce further COD reduction.

3.2. Dye Decolorization Microbial Community 
During the sludge acclimation process, the composition of the microbial community was 
expected to change because some species would be enriched under the new conditions containing different dyes that might be toxic or inhibitory to originally dominant species [16]. In our study, PCR-DGGE analysis of the anaerobic sludge was performed to provide further insight into the 
microbial diversity. The DGGE fingerprints are show n in Figure 4A. Different band patterns in each 
lane were observed from the fingerprints, thus revealing that the microbial composition was changed during the acclimation process. With in creasing dye concentratio n, some bands (AS-17, 
-18, -19, -20, etc.) that were initially present in the medium faded away, whereas some bands (AS-3, -7, -13, -14, etc.) appeared in all the samples.  Moreover, some bands emerged and even became 
more prominent (AS-6, -8, etc.). 
The UPGMA clustering analysis was used to analyze the community similarity after exposure 
different initial dye concentrations. As shown in Figure 4B, populations in sludge with different dye 
concentrations were categorized in to two separate groups. The firs t group represented the sample I 
(with no dye addition) and the samples which were acclimated by three types of dye with low concentrations (lower than 200 mg·L
−1 o f  e a c h  d y e ,  s a m p l e  I I  t o  s a m p l e  V ) .  T h e  s e c o n d  g r o u p  
represented the sludge were acclimated by high  concentrations of dye (higher than 250 mg·L−1 of 
each dye, sample VI to sample VII). The results indicated that the addition of dyes imposed selective pressure on the microbial community . With the increased dye concentrations, the 
community compositions were also altered. However, the microbial communi ty reached a 
relatively stable stage when the dye concentration reached 250 mg·L
−1, as indicated by the high 
similarity of microbial co mmunity structures between the last tw o lanes, thus suggesting that the 
anaerobic sludge ultimately adapted to the dye co ntaining environment, and the structure of the 
bacterial populations in the sludge was maintained. 
The fingerprints were also analyzed using the SDI which describes the change in the species 
dominance of a bacterial co mmunity. The SDI for lane I and VII decr eased from 3.00 to 2.75, a result 
suggesting that some microorganisms did not adapt to the environment containing high 
concentrations of dyes, and they gradually disappeared from the sludge, and thus, the diversity of the bacterial commu nity decreased.

3.2. Dye Decolorization Microbial Community
During the sludge acclimation process, the composition of the microbial community was
expected to change because some species would be enriched under the new conditions containing
different dyes that might be toxic or inhibitory to originally dominant species [ 16]. In our study,
PCR-DGGE analysis of the anaerobic sludge was performed to provide further insight into the
microbial diversity. The DGGE ﬁngerprints are shown in Figure 4A. Different band patterns in
each lane were observed from the ﬁngerprints, thus revealing that the microbial composition was
changed during the acclimation process. With increasing dye concentration, some bands (AS-17, -18,
-19, -20, etc.) that were initially present in the medium faded away, whereas some bands (AS-3, -7,
-13, -14, etc.) appeared in all the samples. Moreover, some bands emerged and even became more
prominent (AS-6, -8, etc.).
The UPGMA clustering analysis was used to analyze the community similarity after exposure
different initial dye concentrations. As shown in Figure 4B, populations in sludge with different
dye concentrations were categorized into two separate groups. The ﬁrst group represented the
sample I (with no dye addition) and the samples which were acclimated by three types of dye with
low concentrations (lower than 200 mg L 1of each dye, sample II to sample V). The second group
represented the sludge were acclimated by high concentrations of dye (higher than 250 mg L 1
of each dye, sample VI to sample VII). The results indicated that the addition of dyes imposed
selective pressure on the microbial community. With the increased dye concentrations, the community
compositions were also altered. However, the microbial community reached a relatively stable stage
when the dye concentration reached 250 mg L 1, as indicated by the high similarity of microbial
community structures between the last two lanes, thus suggesting that the anaerobic sludge ultimately
adapted to the dye containing environment, and the structure of the bacterial populations in the sludge
was maintained.
The ﬁngerprints were also analyzed using the SDI which describes the change in the species
dominance of a bacterial community. The SDI for lane I and VII decreased from 3.00 to 2.75, a result
suggesting that some microorganisms did not adapt to the environment containing high concentrations
of dyes, and they gradually disappeared from the sludge, and thus, the diversity of the bacterial
community decreased.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016 ,13, 1053 11 of 18

To provide further insight into the microbial diversity, dominant bands were excised and 
sequenced (Table 3). The identified sequences ha ve been deposited in GenBank under accession 
numbers KR066383-KR066398. The results of 16S rDNA  gene sequencing revealed the presence of 
an ample diversity of phylotypes . The population of the anaerobi c sludge was assigned to five 
groups, comprising Acidob acteria, Firmicutes ( Lactococcus sp., Clostridium sp. and Bacillus  sp.), 
Bacteroidetes ( Prevotella  sp. and Bacteroides  sp.), Chloroflexi ( Longilinea  sp.) and Proteobacteria 
(Klebsiella sp.). 
In the Firmicutes group, three bacteria  clones (AS-3, -5, -6) belonged to Lactococcus  sp. 
Moreover, the bacteria clones AS-8 and AS-1 4 presented high sequence similarity to Clostridium  sp. 
and Bacillus sp., respectively. In the Bacteroidetes group, clone AS-7 had 98% sequence similarity to 
Prevotella paludivivens . The clone AS-12 had the highest similarity to Bacteroides . The clone AS-4 had 
the closest relationship with Longilinea , which are filamentous strict anaerobes that ferment 
carbohydrates. It belongs to the class Anaerolineae and is usually isolated from thermophilic or mesophilic sludge. Clone AS-9 belonged to Klebsiella , which is a genus of Gram-negative, 
facultatively anaerobic bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae .

To provide further insight into the microbial diversity, dominant bands were excised and
sequenced (Table 3). The identiﬁed sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession
numbers KR066383-KR066398. The results of 16S rDNA gene sequencing revealed the presence of
an ample diversity of phylotypes. The population of the anaerobic sludge was assigned to ﬁve groups,
comprising Acidobacteria, Firmicutes ( Lactococcus sp.,Clostridium sp. and Bacillus sp.), Bacteroidetes
(Prevotella sp. and Bacteroides sp.), Chloroﬂexi ( Longilinea sp.) and Proteobacteria ( Klebsiella sp.).
In the Firmicutes group, three bacteria clones (AS-3, -5, -6) belonged to Lactococcus sp. Moreover,
the bacteria clones AS-8 and AS-14 presented high sequence similarity to Clostridium sp. and Bacillus sp.,
respectively. In the Bacteroidetes group, clone AS-7 had 98% sequence similarity to Prevotella paludivivens .
The clone AS-12 had the highest similarity to Bacteroides . The clone AS-4 had the closest relationship
with Longilinea , which are ﬁlamentous strict anaerobes that ferment carbohydrates. It belongs to
the class Anaerolineae and is usually isolated from thermophilic or mesophilic sludge. Clone AS-9
belonged to Klebsiella , which is a genus of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria of the
family Enterobacteriaceae.
According to the relative intensities of bands on DGGE gel, the dominant band on the line VII
were AS-3, -5, -6, -7, -8, -13, -14, -16. The relative intensity for each band was 7.67%, 7.61%, 7.37%,
7.00%, 13.86%, 8.19%, 8.18% and 5.17%, respectively. Among them, three clones (AS-3, -5, -6) belonged
toLactococcus sp.; the clone AS-7 had close relationship with Prevotella sp.; the clone AS-8 had the
highest similarity to Clostridium sp.; the clone AS-14 belonged to Bacillus sp.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016 ,13, 1053 12 of 18

3.3.1. Monitoring of Intermediates after Methyl Orange Degradation
The reduction products of Methyl Orange were collected for GC-MS analysis. As it shown
in Figure 5A, the compound at retention time 19.17 min was identiﬁed as N,N-dimethylbenzene-
1,4-diamine. However, the boiling point of 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid exceeded the temperature
limit of the GC-MS, therefore only N,N-dimethylbenzene-1,4-diamine of the products was detected in
the GC chromatogram. To test whether 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid was present in the degradation
mixture, LC-MS was used for further analysis. As shown in Figure 5B, 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid
was identiﬁed as one of the Methyl Orange reduction products.
3.3.2. Monitoring of Intermediates after Malachite GreenDegradation
When the extracted metabolites of Malachite Green were injected into the GC-MS, the mass
spectrum identiﬁed three products with retention times 18.73, 19.06 and 37.71 min and m/z ratios
of 121, 137 and 225, respectively (Figure 6A–C). After comparison with the available standards
from the GC-MS NIST library data, intermediate 1 was identiﬁed as N,N-dimethyl-benzenamine,
intermediate 2 was identiﬁed as 3-dimethylamino-phenol, and intermediate 3 was identiﬁed
as 4-dimethylaminobenzophenone.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016 ,13, 1053 13 of 18

intermediate 2 was identified as 2-methylbenzoic acid (Figure 7A,B). These results indicated that 
the anaerobic sludge is able to clave the anthraquinone ring. Notably, several other 
chromatographic peaks were also found but could not be positively identified. Because no additional useful intermediate could be identified, the specific pathway for Reactive Blue 19 degradation is still unclear and requires further study.

4. Discussion 
In our study, the anaerobic sludge decolorized three types of dyes, and it presented much 
higher decolorization ability than that of pure bacterial strains. In general, dye treatment systems 
composed of mixed microbial populations have a hi gher efficiency of dye decolorization. Enhanced 
rates of decolorization of variou s dyes using mixed bacterial cultures have also been reported 
[17,18]. In mixed bacterial systems, the individual  strains may attack the dye molecule at different 
positions or may utilize metabolites produced by the co-existing strains for further degradation. The complementary role of the different bacterial isol ates in the consortium leads to an increase in 
decolorization efficiency. In recent years, the effi cacy of various anaerobic treatment applications for 
the decolorization of synthetic dyes had been inve stigated [2]. However, most bacteria and mixed 
cultures can decompose only one type of dyes with  similar chemical structures. There are very few 
examples of bacteria possessing the ability to decolorize all the azo, anthraquinone and triphenylmethane dyes in a single decolorization system. In our study, the decolorization tests indicated that the anaerobic sludge that we acclimated showed non-specificity for different dyes decolorization. Hence, the anaerobic sludge has promising potential for removing recalcitrant dye pollutants from contaminated environments. 
Several studies had reported a positive relati onship between the incu bation time and COD 
removal rate. For example, I şik and Sponza have found that, in an anaerobic dye treatment reactor, 
the COD removal rate decreased from 79.9% to 29.4% when the incubation time was decreased 
from 100 to 6 h [19]. However, in our study, the COD was drastically decreased during the first 6 h 
incubation, and nearly unchanged in the second 6 h incubation. Similar results have also been observed by Ong et al., who found that after a 25 h incubation, the COD of the wastewater

In our study, the anaerobic sludge decolorized three types of dyes, and it presented much higher
decolorization ability than that of pure bacterial strains. In general, dye treatment systems composed
of mixed microbial populations have a higher efﬁciency of dye decolorization. Enhanced rates of
decolorization of various dyes using mixed bacterial cultures have also been reported [ 17,18]. In mixed

decolorization system. In our study, the decolorization tests indicated that the anaerobic sludge that
we acclimated showed non-speciﬁcity for different dyes decolorization. Hence, the anaerobic sludge
has promising potential for removing recalcitrant dye pollutants from contaminated environments.
Several studies had reported a positive relationship between the incubation time and COD
removal rate. For example, I¸ sik and Sponza have found that, in an anaerobic dye treatment reactor,
the COD removal rate decreased from 79.9% to 29.4% when the incubation time was decreased
from 100 to 6 h [ 19]. However, in our study, the COD was drastically decreased during the ﬁrst
6 h incubation, and nearly unchanged in the second 6 h incubation. Similar results have also been
observed by Ong et al. , who found that after a 25 h incubation, the COD of the wastewater decreased
from 1300 to 600 mg/L, and a longer incubation time did not produce further COD reduction [20].
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that microbial populations in the anaerobic compartment
belonged to the genera Lactococcus ,Clostridium ,Bacillus ,Prevotella ,Bacteroides ,Longilinea andKlebsiella .
Lactococcus is Gram-positive bacterium that generates lactic acid during growth. In recent years,
the dye decolorization ability of lactic acid bacteria has been reported. You and Teng have developed
an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) that can effectively treat wastewater containing Reactive
Black 5. Isolation and identiﬁcation of the degrading bacteria showed that ﬁve strains belonged to
different subspecies of Lactococcus lactis [21]. Moreover, Amani and Ahwany have found that another
lactic acid bacterium, Oenococcus oeni ML34, can decolorize three different azo dyes [ 22]. All these
results indicate that lactic acid bacteria have great potential for use in dye decolorization treatments.
Some species belonging to the genus Bacillus have been widely reported to have a strong ability to
degrade different types of dyes [ 23,24]. Similarly to Bacillus ,Clostridium sp. is wide spread in different
types of anaerobic azo dye decolorization systems. Yang et al. have traced the bacteria populations in
a full-scale printing and dyeing wastewater treatment system and found that, in spite of variation in
the microbial community and composition of the inﬂuents, Clostridium sp. could be detected in all the
test samples [ 25]. Fernando et al. have developed an anaerobic mixed culture capable of decolorizing
a broad-spectrum of azo dyes. Phylogenetic analysis of 16s rDNA sequences obtained from the
anaerobic culture revealed a majority was composed of bacterial species belonging to the genus
Clostridium [26]. In addition to azo dyes, Clostridium sp. has proven to be effective for degradation of
many triphenylmethane dyes. Kim et al. have isolated a novel strain of Clostridium perfringens that can
decolorize a wide range of triphenylmethane dyes with a 27 h anaerobic incubation [ 27].Bacillus and
Clostridium are all Gram-positive bacteria that belong to the family Bacillaceae. The strong ability of
the two genera to decolorize different types of dyes supports their use in the treatment of industrial
wastewater containing synthetic dyes.
Little information concerning the pure isolates, which belong to Bacteroidetes, supports the
potential for dye wastewater treatment. However, Zhang et al. have determined the composition
and diversity of the bacterial community present in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor used for
treating dye wastewater. The results demonstrated that Bacteroidetes was the dominant phylum in the
anaerobic sludge [ 28]. In our study, two genera belonging to Bacteroidetes were also detected in the
anaerobic sludge, thus indicting that these bacterial species might play important roles in pollutant
degradation or sustaining sludge particles.
Numerous studies have reported that Klebsiella have the ability to metabolize azo
compounds [29,30] . Moreover, in our previous study, we have found that Klebsiella is the dominant
genus in both bacterial consortia that was able to decolorize azo dyes under aerobic or anaerobic
conditions [ 31]. In addition, many species belonging to Enterobacteriaceae, such as Shigella ,Enterobacter
andEscherichia , have proven to have dye decolorization ability [ 5,6,32].These reports suggest that it is
likely that most species in the family Enterobacteriaceae have the potential to decolorize azo dyes.
GC-MS and LC-MS analysis demonstrated that the mechanism of microbial degradation of azo
dyes by the anaerobic sludge involves the reductive cleavage of azobonds, thereby resulting in the
formation of colorless solutions containing potentially aromatic amines. It was widely accepted
that the ﬁrst step in the bacterial degradation of azo dyes, in either anaerobic or aerobic conditions,Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016 ,13, 1053 16 of 18
is the reduction of the N=N bond. However, in different decolorization systems, this reduction may
involve different mechanisms, such as enzymes, low molecular weight redox mediators and chemical
reduction by biogenic reductants [ 33]. In this study, the enzyme activities of the crude cell extracts
from the anaerobic sludge was studied. However, none of azoreductase activity could be detected in
the cytoplasmic extracts. It indicated that the azo dye reduction in this work is not a speciﬁc reaction
which is performed by azoreductase. Moreover, we observed that in our biodegradation system,
the addition of synthetic electron carriers, such as lawsone and menadione, could greatly enhance
the decolorization efﬁciency of the azo dyes. All these results showed that the azo reduction by the
anaerobic sludge appeared to be nonspeciﬁc. Electrons were shuttled by various redox mediators from
the bacteria to azo dyes, which leadsto the reduction of the N=N bond.
It has been reported that azo dyes cannot be mineralized completely by bacteria under anaerobic
conditions [ 34]. After decolorization, the corresponding aromatic compounds were stably contained
in the degradation system. These compounds are also harmful to the environment and needed to be
further treated under aerobic conditions.
In our study, three products after Malachite Green decolorization were indentiﬁed. Based on
the previous studies [ 35,36], possible metabolic pathway followed by the anaerobic sludge during
Malachite Green degradation was proposed. At ﬁrst, Malachite Green was converted to the leuco
form of the dye (Leucomalachite Green). Then the leuco form product was cleaved to N,N-dimethyl-
benzenamine and 4-dimethylaminobenzophenone. Then, 4-dimethylaminobenzophenone was degraded
to 3-dimethylamino-phenol and benzaldehyde.
The metabolic pathway of Malachite Green proposed in this study showed some deviation from
the ﬁndings of other studies. It has been reported that the ﬁrst step in the biodegradation of Malachite
Green is the reduction the dye to its leuco-form [ 37]. The Leucomalachite Green then underwent
stepwise removal of its methyl groups from a single side or both sides of nitrogen [ 38,39]. Thus, some
demethyl metabolites, such as demethylLeucomalachite Green, 4-aminobenzophenone and aniline,
could be detected in the degradation systems. However, in our study, the N-demethylation reaction
was not involved in Malachite Green degradation process. The Leucomalachite Green was hydrolyzed
and then oxidized to form N,N-dimethyl-benzenamine and 4-dimethylaminobenzophenone. Then,
4-dimethylaminobenzophenone was hydrolyzed to small pieces.
5. Conclusions
In our study, we developed an anaerobic sludge for dye decolorization. Our results showed that
the sludge decolorized various types of dyes and showed a high efﬁciency for continuous wastewater
treatment. PCR-DGGE analysis revealed that dynamic changes in the microbial communities were
occurred in the anaerobic compartments. Sequencing results indicated that the dominant members
in the sludge belonged to ﬁve different phyla. The results suggested that some of the members are
probably efﬁcient degraders of dyes. Some intermediates of the three types of dye were identiﬁed,
thus indicating that the sludge is able to degrade the dye molecules into smaller fragments through
different mechanisms.
