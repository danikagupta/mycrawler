Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been demonstrated to be a family of biopolymers with good bio-
degradability and biocompatibility. To mimic the real microenvironment of extracellular matrix (ECM)
for cell growth, novel nanoﬁber matrices based on PHA polymers were prepared via a phase separationprocess. Three-dimensional interconnected ﬁbrous networks were observed in these matrices with av-
erage ﬁber diameters of 50–500 nm, which are very similar to the major ECM component collagen.
Compared with nanoﬁber matrix made of poly(
L-lactide), the mechanical properties of PHA nanoﬁber
matrices were signiﬁcantly improved, especially those matrices of PHA blends PHB/PHBHHx containingpolyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and copolyesters PHBHHx consisting of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxy-
hexanoate, and PHB/P3HB4HB that are PHB blended with copolyesters of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 4-
hydroxybutyrate, respectively. More importantly, cell attachment and growth of human keratinocyte cell
line HaCat on the nanoﬁber PHA matrices showed a notable improvement over those on PHA matrices
prepared via an ordinary solution casting method. It was therefore proposed that PHA nanoﬁber matrices
combined the advantages of biodegradation, improved mechanical strengths and the nanostructure ofa natural extracellular matrix, leading to a better cell compatibility, thus they can be used for future
implant biomaterial development.

1. Introduction
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) is a family of biopolyesters pro-
duced by many microorganisms [1]; they have been widely in-
vestigated for applications as tissue engineering materials [2,3] .
Poly(R-3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) with a high crystallinity is one
of the most well characterized homopolymer [4,5] . PHB has been
investigated for uses as surgical suture [6], nerve repair [7], drug-
delivery systems [8]and soft tissue repair [9]. Recently, the
TephaFLEX/C210absorbable suture based on poly(R-4-hydroxybutyrate)
launched by US company Tepha has been approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical applications. To over-
come the brittleness and the narrow processing window of PHB [10–
12], copolymers of R-3-hydroxybutyrate and R-3-hydroxyvalerate,
abbreviated as PHBV, and poly(R-3-hydroxybutyrate- co-R-
3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) as well as poly(R-3-hydroxy-
butyrate- co-R-4-hydroxybutyrate), abbreviated as P3HB4HB, were
produced [13]. These PHAs have shown good biodegradability and
biocompatibility with improved mechanical properties over PHB[2,3,14] . PHB blended with PHBHHx or P3HB4HB had demonstrated
improved properties for potential applications in tissue engineering
[15,16] .
On the other hand, a lot of interests have been paid to mimic the
characteristics of natural extracellular matrix (ECM) to facilitate cell
seeding, adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and neo tissue
genesis [17]. Various matrices prepared using many different
methods including particulate leaching [18], textile technologies
[19]and phase separation [20,21] . Although these artiﬁcial matrices
showed certain advantages, the diameters of the matrix ﬁbers andpores were often at micron sizes and still far from the natural
nanoscale extracellular matrix (ECM) [22,23] . For example, collagen
I, a major natural extracellular matrix and primary component of
dermal, is a three-dimensional network structure composed of
natural ﬁbers ranging from 50 to 500 nm [24,25] . Zhang et al. had
created self-assembled nanoﬁbers with a diameter of 10–20 nm
using ionic self-complementary oligopeptides [26]. These self-as-
sembling oligopeptides can be fabricated into nanoﬁber scaffolds
for three-dimensional culture of mammalian cells including oste-
oblasts, hippocampal neurons and adult mouse neural stem cells
[27–29] . Ma et al. achieved to prepare nanoscale ﬁbrous ECM using
poly(
L-lactide) (PLLA) [30], and PLLA ﬁbrous scaffolds used for bone
regeneration engineering had shown to be efﬁcient [17,31] . Hence,
the design of nanofeatured scaffolds has become one of the exciting
new areas in the tissue engineering.*Corresponding author. Multidisciplinary Research Center, Shantou University,

doi:10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.06.004Biomaterials 29 (2008) 3720–3728In this study, for the ﬁrst time, we attempted to fabricate PHA
nanoﬁber matrices combining the advantages of natural bio-
degradable polymers and the nanostructure of natural extracellular
matrix. The cell growth supporting ability of these nanoﬁber ma-
trices was studied.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Poly(R-3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB, Mw: 504 kDa) was purchased from Nantian
Co. Ltd., Jiangsu, China. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx)
containing 12 mol% 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx) with a Mw of 270 kDa and poly-
(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-4-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB-4HB)] containing 12 mol%
4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB) with a Mw of 540 kDa were kindly donated from Micro-
biology Laboratory, Tsinghua University, Beijing in China. All other chemicals were
analytical reagents.
2.2. Fabrication of PHA matrices
PHB was dissolved in chloroform at 60/C14C to become a clear solution; 1.0–6.0 mL
dioxane was added in the 50 mL beaker with 10 mL PHB chloroform solution. The
mixture was incubated in the frig (4/C14C) for a sufﬁcient time to allow gel formations
in the beaker. The gels were immersed into water for 1 day with twice replacements
of the distilled water. Subsequently, the gels were placed in a freeze-dryer (Modulyo
D-230, Thermo, USA) for 48 h after 1 h incubation at /C080/C14C. On the other hand,
some PHB solutions added with dioxane were incubated in liquid nitrogen for
15 min, or sonicated for 20 min before the gel formation process. The PHB blended
with different amounts of PHBHHx or P3HB4HB was treated with the above men-
tioned procedure to prepare for the PHA nanoﬁber matrices.
For a comparison of cell growth behavior, ordinary solid-walled matrices and
unique nanoﬁbrous matrices made of various PHAs were prepared. The preparation
process of solid-walled matrices was described previously [15,38] .B r i e ﬂ y ,1 . 0go f
PHB, PHB/PHBHHx (70:30) or PHB/P3HB4HB (70:30) material was dissolved in
50 mL of chloroform at 60/C14C. The solution was poured into 120-mm Petri dishes.
The dishes were then maintained at room temperature to allow evaporation of
chloroform for 1 day. Subsequently, the dishes with casting matrices were placed in
a freeze-dryer (Modulyo D-230, Thermo, USA) for 48 h. The evaporation of solvent
resulted in the formation of solid-walled matrices with approximately 200 mmi n
thickness measured by Vernier caliper and SEM. Prior to application in cell cultures,
all resulting matrices including solid-walled and nanoﬁbrous matrices were cut
uniformly into disks of 1.5 cm in diameter and sterilized by immersion in 75% (v/v)
ethanol for 2 h and ultraviolet radiation for 1 h. Then, all matrices were immersed in
PBS overnight.
2.3. Characterization
2.3.1. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies
The PHA matrices were mounted on aluminum stumps, followed by coating
with gold in a sputtering device for 1.5 min at 15 mA. They were then examined
under a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6360LA, Japan).
2.3.2. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) studies
Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) of the polyester samples was conducted
using an X-ray powder diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany). Cu K aradi-
ation ( l¼0.1541 nm) was used as the source, and the X-ray diffraction patterns were
recorded in the range 2 q¼10/C14–50/C14. The percentage of crystallinity was calculated
from diffracted intensity according to Vonk’s method [32].
2.3.3. Study on the density of ﬁbrous matrices
The estimated densities and porosities of the ﬁbrous matrices were obtained as
follows: the circular discs of the ﬁbrous matrices were fabricated as described in
Section 2.2. The diameter and height of a disc were measured to calculate the vol-
ume. The weight of the specimen was measured with an analytical balance accurate
to 10/C04g. The density was calculated from the volume and weight. The porosity 3
was calculated from the measured overall densities Dfof the ﬁbrous matrix and the
skeletal density Dp:
3¼Dp/C0Df
Dp(1)
For the ﬁbrous matrix, the skeletal density was the density of the polymer, which
was given by

where Xcis the degree of crystallinity of a polymer. For PHB, Da¼1.177 g/mL (density

1.260 g/mL, which was due to the crystallinity attributed from R-3-hydroxybutyrate
(3HB) [15,16] ;a n dt h e Da¼1.177 g/mL, because 3HB sustains the main content of
these matrices and the amorphous density resulted from small amounts of 3HHx or
4HB is also approximately equal to 1.177 g/mL [16,38] .
2.3.4. Study on average nanoﬁber diameters
An average nanoﬁber diameter was calculated from the SEM images. Eighty ﬁbers
were measured for each sample. A surface area-to-volume ratio was estimated based
on the average ﬁber diameter. The surface areas of the ﬁber ends were neglected
based on a very large aspect ratio of the ﬁbers, virtually a continuous ﬁber network
(Scheme 1 ), so that the surface area of a ﬁber was calculated with the equation:

is given by

Therefore, the surface-to-volume ratio is given by

To quantify the ﬁber network density, the ﬁber length between two conjunc-
tions (unit length) was estimated based on a simpliﬁed cubic structure model as
described previously [30]. There were three unit ﬁbers in each unit cube. The po-
rosity of the ﬁber network is given by
3¼1/C03Vf

where Vfis the volume of one unit ﬁber and Vcthe volume of the unit cube.

When the ﬁber diameters were compared, a two-tail Student t-test (assuming equal
variances) was performed to determine the statistical signiﬁcance ( p<0.05).
2.3.5. Study on the mechanical properties of the nanoscale ﬁbrous matrices
Uniaxial tensile mechanical testing was performed to evaluate the mechanical
properties of the nanoﬁber matrices using methods similar to those for the me-
chanical testing of natural and engineered tendon, heart valve, and their scaffolding
matrices, with a universal testing instrument (CMT 4204, Sans, China). To measurethe mechanical properties of PHA nanoﬁber matrices, they were prepared in the
120-mm Petri dishes according to the same method used in the 50 mL beaker as
described above. They were then cut into strips of approximately 80 /C210/C20.5 mm
3
for mechanical property testing. A gauge length of 40 mm (distance between two
grips) and a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min were used. Six specimens were tested for
each sample. The averages and standard deviations from the specimens fractured in
the middle (4–6) were reported.
2.3.6. Assays of cell attachment and viability
Studies on the cell attachment and viability were conducted on nanoﬁber and
ordinarily prepared solid-walled matrices using human keratinocyte cell line HaCat,
which was purchased from China Center for Type Culture Collection in Wuhan
University; 2.0 /C2104cells/well of HaCat was seeded on each matrix measuring

containing 10% FBS.
HaCat cells were incubated at 37/C14C for 4 h and 3 days to evaluate cell attach-
ment and viability, respectively. The unattached cells were removed by washing
with PBS three times. The number of attached cells was assayed by CCK-8 (Cell
Counting Kit-8, Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Theoptical density (OD) at 450 nm was determined via a microplate reader (Thermo-
Labsystems, Multiskan Mk3, Finland).
3. Results
3.1. Preparation of PHA based nanoﬁber matrices
To prepare nanoscale matrix, PHB dissolved in chloroform was
added with 1,4-dioxane (Diox), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-
dimethylformamide (DMF), this led to the formation of a PHB gel.
Only the addition of Diox turned PHB solution into a nanoﬁber
matrix with diameters ranging from 80 to 350 nm ( Fig. 1 a and b).
DMF and THF created a PHB particle matrix, respectively ( Fig. 1 c
and d). This PHB preparation process differed from that of poly( L-
lactide) (PLLA) [30]. The difference can be attributed to the pre-
ferred solubility of PHB in chloroform and the proper freezing point
of Diox which is at 11.8/C14C.
Fabrication of nanoﬁber matrices made of PHB was studied
under different conditions. PHB nanoﬁber matrix prepared at 4/C14C
was more homogeneous compared with those prepared under
room temperature (23/C14C) (Fig. 2 a and b). A 1 day water treatment
to the PHB gel produced a more satisfactory nanostructure network
(Fig. 2 a and c). However, ethanol treatment changed the ﬁbrous
structures to similar particle matrices ( Fig. 2 d). In addition, liquid
nitrogen or sonication treatment produced more homogeneous
nanoﬁbers with diameters of 80–150 nm, especially for sonicated
matrices ( Fig. 3 a–d).
PHB blended with P3HB4HB or PHBHHx was tested for prepa-
ration of nanoﬁber matrices made of various PHAs. At a weightmixing ratio of 70:30 for PHB/PHBHHx or PHB/P3HB4HB, the ma-
trices still showed a continuous ﬁbrous network structure ( Fig. 4 a
and c). While PHB content was lowered to 60% in the blends, the
ﬁbrous network structure was diluted signiﬁcantly compared with
pure PHB nanoﬁbers ( Fig. 4 b and d). It was therefore suggested that
the weight mixing ratio of PHB be maintained above 60% in the
matrices to allow the formation of a continuous nanoscale ﬁbrous
network structure.
The gelation time for forming various nanoﬁber matrices was
studied. It was found that the gelation time decreased with in-
creasing amount of dioxane from 1.0 to 6.0 mL or increasing PHB
concentration ( Table 1 ). Gelation temperature affected gelation
time; a lower temperature was found more suitable for formation
of a high porous nanoﬁber scaffold ( Table 1 ). Additionally, more
PHBHHx or P3HB4HB in the blended matrices could lengthen the
gelation time ( Table 2 ).
3.2. Study on main properties of PHA based matrices
The porosity of implant scaffold plays an important role in
supporting cell growth in a matrix for tissue regeneration. In this
study, the porosities of PHB matrices ranged from 90.1 to 98.4% at
4/C14C, and from 85.9 to 95.8% at 23/C14C, room temperature ( Table 1 ).
Increasing porosity in PHB matrices correlated with increasing
amount of Diox in the PHB chloroform solution, up to 98.4% of 6 mL
Diox in each 10 mL 1% (wt/v) PHB chloroform solution. In addition,
the porosity of nanoﬁber matrices was inﬂuenced by the PHB
concentration and gelation temperature to some extend. When
PHB was increasingly blended with other PHA materials, the po-
rosities of the nanoﬁber matrices were also decreased slightly
(Table 2 ). And the blended matrices of PHB/PHBHHx and PHB/
P3HB4HB with a ratio of 60/40 had signiﬁcantly reduced the
porosities to 84.4 and 83.8%, respectively ( Table 2 and Fig. 4 ).

networks with average ﬁber diameters of approximately
165/C680 nm regardless of PHB concentration ( Table 3 ); this result
was similar with that of the nanoﬁber made of PLLA reported by Ma
et al. [30]. The surface/volume ratios were also found to be corre-
lated with the average ﬁber diameters in Eq. (5), ranging from 17.0
to 24.8 mm/C01(Table 3 ). The unit length of PHA matrices related to
the porosity and the average ﬁber diameter in a matrix was de-
scribed in Eq. (8), this was shown to be 811–1373 nm. The unit
length decreased slightly when PHB concentration of the matrix
increased ( Table 3 ).
Mechanical properties of nanoﬁber matrices were signiﬁcantly
improved in the blend matrices made of PHB/PHBHHx or PHB/
P3HB4HB ( Fig. 5 ). The modulus, tensile strength and elongation at
break showed a signiﬁcant increase with increasing PHBHHx or
P3HB4HB contents in the blended matrices. The mechanicalproperties of the 60/40 blended PHB/PHA matrices notably in-
creased but diluted the nanoﬁbrous structures ( Figs. 4 and 5 ).
However, 70/30 PHB/PHBHHx or PHB/P3HB4HB matrices showed
a remarkably improved mechanical strength accompanied by
a continuous ﬁbrous network ( Figs. 4 and 5 ).
3.3. Cell behaviors on PHA based matrices
HaCat cells were seeded on the nanoﬁber matrices and ordinary
solid-walled matrices. Cells were found heavily embedded in thePHB nanoﬁber matrix while they were just adhered on the PHB
solid-walled matrix ( Fig. 6 a and b). Cell attachment and viability
were studied using CCK-8 assay according to the manufacturers’
instructions. Cell growth was observed to increase remarkably on
the nanoﬁber matrices compared with that in the ordinary solid-
walled matrices made of the same materials ( Fig. 6 c and d). This

Note that the porosities of PHB matrices were higher at 4/C14C than those at 23/C14C.X.-T. Li et al. / Biomaterials 29 (2008) 3720–3728 3724signiﬁcant difference was mainly attributed to the nanoﬁber ar-
chitecture resembling to that of the natural extracellular matrix
[39]. Furthermore, the increase rate with approximately 60% of cell
attachment on the PHB nanoﬁber matrices was most signiﬁcant
compared with that of the other matrices ( Fig. 6 c), this was mainly
attributed to the highest porosity with interconnected porous
structure in the PHB nanoﬁber matrix.
4. Discussion
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) especially PHB, PHBV, PHBHHx
and P3HB4HB had been strongly demonstrated biodegradability
and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo [1–3] . Many interests have
been focused on developing PHA for tissue engineering applica-
tions [2,3,14] . However, many of these biomaterials are still differ-
ent from the real microenvironment of extracellular matrix (ECM);
this challenge must be met in order to prepare biomaterials for
tissue regeneration [3,17,23] . In our study, a series of nanoﬁber
matrices made of PHA materials were prepared via several unique
solution processes. These PHA matrices contain highly porous
structures with three-dimensional continuous ﬁbrous networks;
such structures are similar to a collagen, which is the most abun-
dant ECM protein in human body [17,34] . At the same time, the
average diameter of the PHA nanoﬁbers is similar to the natural
collagen ﬁbers, ranging from 50 to 500 nm [24,25] .
The nanoﬁbrous structure of PHB matrix was formed when Diox
was added into the PHB chloroform solution, other non-solvents
such as THF and DMF could not produce the nanoﬁbrous structures
(Fig. 1 ). The process differs from the preparation of PLLA nano-
ﬁbrous matrices, and mainly dues to the different solubility of PHB
and PLLA [30,33] . The gel formed at 4/C14C and treated with water
within a day produced satisfactory nanoﬁbrous structures ( Fig. 2 ),
especially with the additional treatment of liquid nitrogen or son-
ication before gelation, respectively ( Fig. 3 ). The treatment using
liquid nitrogen or sonication led to a more homogeneous
nanostructure with ﬁber diameters ranging from 80 to 150 nm
(Fig. 3 b and d), Unfortunately, the mechanical strengths through
both treatments became too brittle to determine by instrument.
Other lower temperatures such as /C020 or /C080/C14C had little in-
ﬂuence on the formation of PHA nanoﬁber matrix, which is similar
to the preparation process for PLLA nanoﬁber [30]. Our results
revealed that the gelation time depended on PHB concentration
and the amount of Diox added to the PHB solution ( Table 1 ). WithTable 2

time was shortened signiﬁcantly ( Table 1 ). Obviously the PHA ge-
lation behavior is inﬂuenced by both quantity of the PHA non-
solvent Diox and solvent chloroform, a PHA solution could become
a gel when Diox and chloroform were mixed in a proper ratio. More
Diox in PHA solution was beneﬁcial for forming a nanoﬁbrous
continuous network with high porosity ( Table 1 ). However, when
the amount of Diox was added over 4.0 mL into 10 mL 1% PHB so-
lution, the matrix was stuck on the beaker so that the mechanical
strength can’t be evaluated. After a series optimization, followingconditions including 3.0 mL Diox in 10 mL PHA solution and a ge-
lation temperature of 4/C14C for a 15–21 h followed by 24 h water
treatment were selected for PHA nanoﬁbrous matrix preparation.
Our technique belongs to a phase separation of polymer solu-
tion, which can also be considered a self-assembly process. Instead
of assembling small molecules, large molecules of polymer are
aggregated into a new phase from an initially homogeneous one-
phase system [21]. Compared with conventional electrospun pro-
cess for making nanoﬁber [40], our technique for preparing the
PHA nanoﬁber matrices is simple; it does not require any expensive

from electrospinning is often lacked of a natural three-dimensional
morphology that is through self-assembled behaviors [21,29] .
Therefore, our technique is very helpful for developing novel
nanostructure implant PHA matrices for applications in tissue
engineering.
A highly porous structure with interconnected spaces is desir-
able for an implant scaffold as this structure will provide ECM
mimic base for cell attachment, migration and proliferation [23,35] .
Increasing the amount of Diox in the PHB chloroform solution can
increase the porosity of PHB matrix, up to 98.4% of 6 mL Diox in
each 10 mL 1% (wt/v) PHB chloroform solution, but reduces the
mechanical strength to some extend. These matrices of PHB/
PHBHHx or PHB/P3HB4HB showed decreased porosities from 94.6%
for PHB only matrices ( Table 1 ) to 83.8–93.1% for the blended
matrices ( Table 2 ) accompanied with reduced crystallinity and
blurred nanoﬁbrous structure when PHB content in the blends
decreased ( Table 2 andFig. 4 ). At the highest ratio of 60/40 for PHB/
PHBHHx or PHB/P3HB4HB, gelation time was over 20 h, the longest
among all blended samples studied, the blends showed the lowest
crystallinity and the smallest porosity yet the highest density ( Table
2), accompanied by the best mechanical properties ( Fig. 5 ). This
phenomenon was mainly attributed to the amorphous part of
PHBHHx or P3HB4HB in the blends that reduced the crystallinity of
highly crystal PHB [38], thus contributes to improve the weak
properties of crystal PHB [15,16] . However, reduced crystallinity of
a polymer prevented the formation of a clear nanoﬁbrous structure
[30]. As a compromise, it was found that 70/30 PHB/PHBHHx or
PHB/P3HB4HB matrix showed a combination of improved me-
chanical strength and formation of a clear continuous nanoﬁber
network ( Figs. 4 and 5 ). To prepare such an ECM mimic structure,
a proper surface-to-volume ratio is required [36]. Apparently, PHB
only matrices showed higher surface-to-volume ratios compared
with the PHA blends, and a higher PHB content in the PHA blends
led to a higher surface-to-volume ratios ( Table 3 ). All the PHA
nanoﬁbrous structures supported better cell growth compared
with PHA solid-walled ﬁlms without the highly porous nano-
structure ( Fig. 6 ).
Besides the cell growth supporting ability, mechanical proper-
ties of a polymer matrix are important for selection of biomaterials
in tissue engineering; especially for application in a load-bearing
position such as bone ﬁxation, replacement or artiﬁcial blood
vessels [35,37] . The presence of elastic PHBHHx or P3HB4HB in the
PHB dominated blended matrices increased their modulus, tensile
strength and elongation at break ( Fig. 5 ). In this study, mechanical
properties of 60/40 PHB/PHA blended matrices showed maxima
due to their completed miscibility and reduced polymer crystal-
linity [15,16] ; but the nanoﬁbrous structures were diluted notably
(Fig. 4 b and d). In contrast, Young’s modulus, tensile strength and
elongation at break of 70/30 PHB/PHA nanoﬁber matrix were ap-
proximately 150 MPa, 1.8 MPa and 11.5%, respectively, accompanied
by a still continuous ﬁbrous nanostructure ( Fig. 4 a and c). As
expected, the ﬁber diameter and ﬁber unit length could inﬂuence
the mechanical properties of the matrix to some extent ( Table 3 and
Fig. 5 ). Thus, the PHA nanoﬁber matrices indicated signiﬁcantly
improved mechanical properties with proper adjustability advan-tages over other nanoﬁber matrices, such as PLLA nanoﬁber matrix
reported by Ma et al. [17,30] . Young’s modulus, tensile strength and
elongation at break of 2% (wt/v) PLLA nanoﬁber matrix are 4.0 MPa,
0.1 MPa and 6.1%, respectively [30], which are all inferior to that of
PHA nanoﬁber matrices, especially the blended PHA nanoﬁber
matrix in a proper ratio.
HaCat cells’ growth on matrices made of PHB, PHB/PHBHHx
(70:30) or PHB/P3HB4HB (70:30) was assayed to evaluate the effect
of nanoﬁber matrix. Results strongly demonstrated that cell be-
haviors including morphology, adhesion ability and viability on thenanoﬁbrous matrices were better than those on the ordinary solid-
walled matrices ( Fig. 6 ). The nanoﬁber architecture resembling the
collagen as a main component of the natural extracellular matrix
could play a key role for better cell attachment, migration, growth
and function in tissue regeneration [34]. The inﬂuences of nano-
scale structures on cell behaviors were reported as early as 1960s
[41], cells were found attached to and organized around ﬁbers with
diameters smaller than that of the cells [42]. Some scaffolds made
of PLA, PLGA and PHA contain often microﬁbers with diameter of 5–
50mm or micropores of 10–50 mm[3,43] . Since the size of most cells
(5–10 mm) is similar to or smaller than these microstructures (10–
100mm), these cells exhibit a two-dimensional topography with
a curvature depending on the microﬁber diameters or on the pore
size upon their attachment [23]. In order to culture cells in a truly
three-dimensional microenvironment, these dimensions must be
signiﬁcantly smaller than cells so that the cells could be surrounded
by the scaffolds, much like the extracellular environment [23].
Thus, the nanoﬁbrous matrix such as PHA nanoﬁber matrix is a real
three-dimensional microenvironment for cells [43]. Our results of
PHA nanoﬁbers were consistent with some recent investigations
using nanostructural materials as artiﬁcial ECM [44–46] .
5. Conclusions
We had successfully fabricated PHB, PHB/PHBHHx and PHB/
P3HB4HB nanoﬁber matrices that combine the advantages of bio-
degradability, biocompatibility, improved mechanical strength and
similarity to architectures of natural collagen extracellular matrix.
These PHA nanoﬁber matrices were found to better support cell
attachment and cell viability compared with PHA solid-walled
matrices prepared from ordinary solution casting method. Me-
chanical properties, porosity and nanostructure of the matrices can
be adjusted by changing PHB to PHBHHx or to P3HB4HB ratios in
the blend. Compared with conventional electrospun process for
making nanoﬁber, our technique for preparing the PHA nanoﬁber
matrices is simple; it does not require any equipment and com-
plicated processing such as ﬁber extrusion, drawing, crimping,
cutting, carding, needling, degreasing and punching. This is very
helpful for developing novel nanostructure implant PHA matrices
for applications in skin engineering and even nerve regeneration
[47,48] . The future studies will be performed for practical applica-
tions in vitro and in vivo.
