ABSTRACT. Laccases are polyphenol oxidases produced by many 
fungi and have many applications in textile, food and beverage, and 
pulp and paper industries. Laccase production can be induced using 
aromatic or phenolic compounds that mostly affect the transcription of 
laccase-encoding genes. In this study, we analyzed laccase and biomass 
production by Agaricus blazei  in the presence of different concentrations of 
nitrogen, copper, and inducers such as pyrogallol, veratryl alcohol, xylidine, 
vanillin, guaiacol, and ethanol. Laccase production by A. blazei  U2-4 
reached 43.8 U/mL in the presence of 2.8 g/L nitrogen and 150 µM copper. 
However, addition of copper to the cultivation medium decreased biomass 
production. Different compounds differentially induced laccase production 
by A. blazei . Moreover, different concentrations of these inducers exerted 
different effects on laccase activity. Ethanol (1.0 mM), guaiacol (0.5 mM), 
and vanillin (0.5 mM) were the best inducers and increased laccase activity 
by 120% ( A. blazei  U2-2), 30% ( A. blazei  U2-3), and 9% ( A. blazei  U2-4), 15883

INTRODUCTION
In the nature, basidiomycete fungi mainly degrade lignin by producing one or more 
extracellular enzymes, including peroxidases and laccases (EC 1.10.3.2).
Laccases are copper-containing polyphenol oxidases that use the redox capacity of copper 
ions to oxidize various phenolic substrates (typically p-diphenol) and reduce molecular oxygen to 
water (Baldrian, 2006). Wide substrate specificity of laccases allows them to oxidize a broad range 
of compounds because of which they are extensively used in various industries such as textile, 
food and beverage, pulp and paper, pharmaceutical, chemical, cosmetic, nanobiotechnology, 
and bioremediation industries (Piscitelli et al., 2010). Biotechnological applications require large 
amounts of enzyme at a low cost to maintain the feasibility of the industrial processes. Therefore, 
continuous research should be performed to identify organisms that produce new enzymes with 
special properties and to optimize culture conditions for obtaining enzymes with the highest activity 
by using inducers and mediators (Elisashvili and Kachlishvili, 2009).
Agaricus blazei ss. Heinemann, referred to as A. brasiliensis  by Wasser (Eira et al., 2002) 
and A. subrufescens  Peck by Kerrigan (Kerrigan, 2005), is an edible mushroom native to Brazil and 
is cultivated worldwide. This fungus has received considerable attention because it exerts different 
biological effects such as anticancer (Bertéli et al., 2014), immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, anti-
infectious, antimetastatic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, photoprotective, and antimutagenic 
effects (Costa et al., 2015).
A. blazei  naturally grows in the litter layer of soil and humus layer of forests and grasslands 
(Eira et al., 2002). It degrades lignin and structurally similar compounds at a lower rate than white-rot 
fungi. A. blazei  is a laccase producer (Ullrich et al., 2005; D’Agostini et al., 2011; Valle et al., 2014); 
however, no information is available on compounds that induce laccase production by A. blazei .
The present study evaluated the laccase-producing capacity of Brazilian A. blazei  strains 
and analyzed the potential of different compounds for inducing laccase production by these strains.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Microorganisms and culture conditions
A. blazei  strain U2-4 available at the culture collection of Molecular Biology Laboratory, 
Paranaense University (UNIPAR), Brazil, was evaluated. Mycelia of A. blazei  U2-4 were cultured 
on 1% (w/v) malt extract agar (MEA) at 25°C and were then subcultured on 2% (w/v) MEA at 28°C 
for 7 days to be used as inoculum. Additionally, mycelia were harvested from the surface of MEA 
and maintained at -80°C until DNA extraction.
A. blazei  U2-4 was cultivated in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL) containing 60 mL liquid 
medium consisting of 1.5 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L MgSO4, 0.5 g/L KCl, 0.036 g/L FeSO4·7H2O, 
0.035 g/L ZnSO4·H2O, and 10 g/L glucose. After sterilization at 121°C for 20 min, 300 g/L sterile 15884

urea was added to the liquid medium to obtain a final nitrogen concentration of 0.28 or 2.8 g/L. 
Flasks containing the liquid medium were inoculated with the mycelia of A. blazei  U2-4 and were 
maintained in the dark at 28°C for 21 days. After 4 days of mycelial growth, 30 mM CuSO4 was 
added to the cultivation medium to obtain a final copper concentration of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 
or 300 µM. Laccase activity was measured on the final day of cultivation. Fungal biomass was 
measured gravimetrically after recovering mycelia by centrifugation (2900 g for 15 min at 4°C) and 
by drying at 65°C until a constant mass was obtained.
Urea and CuSO4 concentrations that provided the most favorable results were used in 
subsequent experiments to evaluate the effect of different inducers on the laccase activity of A. blazei  
U2-4, A. blazei  U2-1, A. blazei  U2-2, and A. blazei  U2-3. Effect of pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene), 
veratryl alcohol (3,4-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol), xylidine (2,5-dimethylaniline), vanillin (4-hydroxy-
3-methoxybenzaldehyde), guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol), and ethanol on the laccase activity of A. 
blazei  strains was examined. For this, 5 mM of each inducer was added to the cultivation medium 
after 3 days of cultivation to obtain a final concentration of 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mM. Laccase activity 
was measured after every 3 days.
All the experiments were conducted using 4 replicates. Results were analyzed by variance 
analyses, and differences among averages were determined using Scott-Knott test (P ≤ 0.05).
Laccase assay
Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) activity was determined by monitoring the oxidation of 2,2’-azino-
bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS; Sigma; St. Louis, MO, USA). Laccase activity 
was determined in a reaction mixture containing 200 µL cultivation medium, 700 µL water, 450 
µL 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and 150 µL 1 mM ABTS and by incubating the reaction 
mixture at 30°C for 10 min. The reaction was interrupted by adding 100 µL 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic 
acid. The volume of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 5 mL using water, and absorbance of the 
mixture was measured at 420 nm. Oxidation of ABTS increased the absorbance of the mixture at 
420 nm ( e = 36,000 M/cm). A mixture containing 200 µL cultivation medium, 850 µL water, and 450 
µL sodium acetate buffer and a mixture containing 900 µL water, 450 µL sodium acetate buffer, and 
150 µL ABTS were used as analytical controls. Laccase activity was expressed in international units 
(U) and was defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 µmol of substrate per minute.
Molecular confirmation of strain identity
Mycelia of all A. blazei  strains were ground in liquid nitrogen, and genomic DNA 
was extracted using CTAB buffer [2% (w/v) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 1.4 M NaCl, 
100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM EDTA, 0.2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% (w/v) 
proteinase K] according to a procedure described by Doyle and Doyle (1987). Primers ITS-1 
(5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and ITS-4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'; White et al., 
1990) were used to amplify internal transcribed spacers (ITSs) from ribosomal DNA (rDNA). PCR 
was performed in 25 µL 1X PCR amplification buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 µM of each 
primer, 100 µM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 25 ng DNA, and 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase 
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) by using Mastercycler Gradient Thermocycler (Eppendorf, 
Hamburg, Germany). PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 min; 35 
cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 15885

s; and final extension at 72°C for 7 min. Control reactions lacking template DNA were conducted 
in parallel. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% (w/v) agarose gel prepared using TAE 
buffer (40 mM Tris-acetate and 1 mM EDTA) and were stained using ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/mL). 
The PCR products were purified using Pure Link PCR Purification Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, 
CA, USA) and were sequenced using ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA). ITS sequences were compared with other sequences present in the GenBank 
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) by using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Amplification of ITS rDNA produced a unique 700-bp fragment for all the strains examined. 
In addition, direct sequencing and analysis of this fragment showed high sequence similarity, thus 
confirming that the 4 strains (U2-1, U2-2, U2-3, and U2-4) belonged to A. blazei . The sequences 
of the 700-bp fragment amplified from the genomic DNA of the 4 A. blazei  strains were deposited 
in GenBank under accession Nos. KF281110, KF281111, KF281112, and KF281113, respectively.
Effect of nitrogen and copper concentrations on laccase and biomass production
Table 1 shows the laccase activity of and biomass production by A. blazei  U2-4 in the 
presence of different nitrogen (urea) and copper (CuSO4) concentrations. In the absence of copper, 
the highest (P  ≤ 0.05) laccase activity (43.8 U/mL) was obtained in the presence of 2.8 g/L nitrogen; 
this value was 760% higher than that obtained with 0.28 g/L nitrogen. Under these conditions, the 
highest laccase production by A. blazei  U2-4 was 8.7-fold higher than that reported by Ullrich et al. 
(2005) for A. blazei  strain cultivated in tomato juice (5 U/mL) and 4.5-fold higher than that reported 
by Valle et al. (2014a) for the same strain cultivated in sugarcane molasses (9.7 U/mL).

The influence of nitrogen on laccase production has been controversial, since increased 
enzyme activity has been observed in both situations, under limiting and non-limiting nitrogen, 
in basidiomycete fungi (Giardina et al., 2010). Nitrogen affects laccase production at the 
transcriptional level. However, different nitrogen concentrations exert different effects on laccase 
production by different fungal species. Higher nitrogen concentration increases laccase production 
by Pleurotus ostreatus  and Lentinula edodes  but decreases laccase production by Phanerochaete 
chrysosporium , Phlebia brevispora , Coriolus versicolor , and Pholiota mutabilis (Leatham and Kirk, 15886
J.S. Valle et al.
©FUNPEC-RP www.funpecrp.com.br Genetics and Molecular Research 14 (4): 15882-15891 (2015)
1983). Laccase production by Lentinus crinitus  increases in the presence of 2.8 g/L nitrogen (Valle 
et al., 2014b) while that by P. ostreatus  increases in the presence of 0.23 g/L nitrogen (Hou et al., 
2004). The results of the present study and those of other studies (Ullrich et al., 2005; D’Agostini 
et al., 2011; Valle et al., 2014a) suggest that nitrogen concentrations in the range of 1.5-3.0 g/L 
induce maximum laccase production by A. blazei . Further, use of a protein nitrogen source such as 
urea promotes laccase production while use of inorganic nitrogen decreases laccase production 
(Piscitelli et al., 2011).
All concentrations of copper examined in this study increased (P ≤ 0.05) the laccase activity 
of A. blazei  U2-4 in the presence of 0.28 g/L nitrogen (Table 1). Laccase activity in the cultivation 
medium containing 150 µM copper was 9-fold higher (45.7 U/mL) than that in the control medium 
lacking copper (5.1 U/mL). However, addition of CuSO4 to the cultivation medium containing 2.8 
g/L nitrogen did not significantly increase laccase production. This has also been reported for 
laccase production by other fungal species. Laccase production by P. ostreatus  was high in a 
nitrogen-limited medium containing 1 mM copper (400 U/mL; Baldrian and Gabriel, 2002). Copper 
is one of the most efficient inducers of laccase activity because it is required for the synthesis of 
copper-containing polyphenol oxidases. Furthermore, copper regulates the expression of laccase-
encoding genes in various fungal species through metal-responsive elements present in the 
promoter regions of these genes (Nitheranont et al., 2011).
The finding that addition of copper to the cultivation medium increased the laccase activity 
of A. blazei  strains suggested that copper affected mechanisms regulating the transcription of 
laccase-encoding genes in these strains.
Biomass production by A. blazei  U2-4 was inversely proportional to copper concentration 
(Table 1). Biomass production decreased (P ≤ 0.05) in the presence of copper and reached a 
minimum concentration of 0.4 mg/mL in the presence of 300 µM CuSO4. Free copper ions exert 
oxidative stress that reduces fungal growth; this may be the reason for low biomass production 
in the presence of higher copper concentrations (Palmieri et al., 2000). However did not affect 
laccase production by A. blazei .
Effect of different compounds on laccase and biomass production
When other A. blazei  strains (U2-3, U2-1, and U2-2) were cultured in the same medium 
(2.8 g/L nitrogen and 150 µM copper) that was used for cultivating A. blazei  U2-4, maximum 
laccase activity (P ≤ 0.05) was observed for A. blazei  U2-3 (10.3 U/mL) and A. blazei  U2-1 (7.6 U/
mL; Table 2) and minimum activity (4.8 U/mL) was observed for A. blazei  U2-2. Laccase activity of 
these strains peaked on different days. Laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-3 and A. blazei  U2-4 was 
the highest (0.07 and 0.05 U·mL-1·h-1, respectively; P ≤ 0.05) while that of A. blazei  U2-1 and A. 
blazei  U2-2 was the lowest (0.03 and 0.02 U·mL-1·h-1, respectively).
Addition of inducers to the culture medium increased laccase production (Table 2). To 
date, no data are available on the induction of laccase production of A. blazei  strains. Different 
concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mM) of inducers were examined to determine the concentration 
that resulted in the highest induction. Incubation of A. blazei  strains with different inducers for 21 
days exerted different effects on laccase activity.
Induction of laccase production by these compounds may be associated with the 
development of fungal responses to toxic aromatic compounds commonly produced during lignin 
degradation. Many compounds potentially induce laccase production. However, the effects of these 15887

compounds may vary depending on the fungal strain and type of compound and concentration 
used (Elisashvili et al., 2010; Piscitelli et al., 2011).

Control, without inducer; NT, not tested. Averages indicated by the same letter do not differ statistically according to 
the Scott-Knott test (P ≤ 0.05).
The results of the present study are consistent with the above findings because different 
strains examined in this study responded differently to the same inducer. Different compounds 
differentially induced laccase production by A. blazei  strains; moreover, different concentrations 
of these compounds exerted different effects on the laccase activity of A. blazei  strains examined.
The maximum laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-1 was not affected by the different inducers 
tested (Table 2). Ethanol and vanillin decreased the time required for achieving peak laccase 
activity from 12 days to 6 days, indicating a 67% increment in productivity. Maximum laccase 
activity of A. blazei  U2-2 was achieved only in the presence of 0.5 mM guaiacol and 1.0 and 1.5 
mM ethanol (Table 2). Laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-3  was higher (P ≤ 0.05) in the presence of 
vanillin and guaiacol (0.5 and 1.0 mM for both). However, the time required for achieving peak 
laccase activity with these inducers increased from 6 days to 15 days, indicating a 43% reduction 
in productivity. All the concentrations of xylidine and pyrogallol examined in this study decreased 
the laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-1, A. blazei  U2-2, and A. blazei  U2-3.
All the compounds tested induced the laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-4 (Table 2). Ethanol, 
guaiacol, vanillin, and veratryl alcohol increased laccase activity at all the concentrations tested. 
However, veratryl alcohol was the only inducer that decreased the time required for achieving 
peak laccase activity from 21 days to 6 days, indicating a 300% increase in productivity. Only 1.0 
mM pyrogallol induced the laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-4. It should be noted that pyrogallol 
inhibited the laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-4 initially after its addition to the cultivation medium. 
Although no laccase production was detected in the first 3 days after pyrogallol addition, the fungus 
retained its laccase-producing capacity. The laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-4 increased again 
after approximately 15 days of pyrogallol addition and reached a maximum after 21 days. Xylidine 
increased laccase activity at a concentration of 0.5 mM.
Pyrogallol, a catechol derivative, decreased the maximum laccase activity of all the strains 
examined (Table 1). A. blazei  U2-4 retained its laccase-producing capacity in the presence of 15888
J.S. Valle et al.

pyrogallol, indicating that despite the initial inhibition, mycelia of A. blazei  U2-4 remained metabolically 
active. Pyrogallol also strongly decreased the laccase activity of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  and 
Coriolus hirsutus  (Eggert et al., 1996) but increased the laccase activity of Cerrena unicolor by 2.5 
fold (Elisashvili et al., 2010). Because pyrogallol increased fungal growth (Table 3), the delayed 
peak in the laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-4 may be because of an increase in biomass. This result 
may be because of the inhibition of constitutive forms of laccase and expression of new isoforms 
(Matsumoto-Akanuma et al., 2014). However, other strains examined in this study did not retain 
their laccase-producing capacity during fermentation and levels of laccases produced by these 
strains remained low.
Veratryl alcohol significantly increased the maximum laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-4 
(Table 2), with a large increment in productivity. An ideal inducer should increase enzyme production 
and activity and decrease fermentation time (Elisashvili et al., 2010). Veratryl alcohol is a potent 
inducer of laccase activity and has been used in various studies involving different fungi (Piscitelli 
et al., 2011). Xavier et al. (2007) showed that different concentrations of veratryl alcohol induced 
the laccase activity of Trametes versicolor . However, some studies indicated that veratryl alcohol 
did not induce laccase activity (Hou et al., 2004). Varied response to veratryl alcohol observed in 
the present study indicates a strong effect of fungal strains on laccase activity because cultivation 
conditions and veratryl alcohol concentration were the same for all the strains.
We observed that addition of xylidine significantly decreased the maximum laccase activity 
of all the strains (Table 2), except that of A. blazei  U2-4, which increased by 5% in the presence of 
0.5 mM xylidine. Xylidine induces laccase production in many fungi (Xiao et al., 2004). However, 
specific concentrations of xylidine may exert a toxic effect on some fungi and inhibit laccase 
production. Many studies have shown that only lower concentrations of xylidine induce laccase 
production (Hou et al., 2004; Xavier et al., 2007). The negative effect of xylidine on the laccase 
activity of A. blazei  strains examined in the present study may be because of the concentrations of 
xylidine used (0.5-1.5 mM).
Vanillin significantly increased the maximum laccase activity of A. blazei  U2-3 and A. blazei  
U2-4. The effect of vanillin on the induction of laccase activity has been reported previously (Piscitelli 
et al., 2011). Addition of vanillin to the cultivation medium of Trametes  sp. AH28-2 significantly 
increased its laccase activity and induced the expression of a specific laccase isoenzyme (Xiao et 
al., 2004). The induction effect of vanillin seems to be influenced by other aspects of fermentation. 
Vanillin decreased the laccase activity of C. unicolor  grown in a medium containing mannitol. 
However, vanillin treatment of C. unicolor  grown in a synthetic medium containing a residue of 
ethanol production improved laccase activity (Elisashvili et al., 2010), indicating that cultivation 
conditions also influenced the induction of laccase activity by specific compounds.
Guaiacol and ethanol were excellent inducers of the laccase activity of A. blazei  strains. 
Guaiacol and ethanol were the only compounds that increased the maximum laccase activity of 
A. blazei  U2-2 by 60 and 120%, respectively. Addition of 35 g/L ethanol to solid-state fermentation 
with Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  ss3 increased the laccase activity of this fungus by 155-fold relative 
to that of the control (Lomascolo et al., 2003).
Most inducers of laccase production are expensive and toxic. Applicability of new laccases 
to different industrial processes depends on the use of less toxic, cheaper, and easily available 
inducers (Hou et al., 2004). Ethanol is an optimal inducer of laccase production by A. blazei  
because it is cheaper, more easily available, and less toxic than other compounds commonly used 
for inducing laccase production.15889

Comparison of the results of the present study with those of previous studies indicated 
that A. blazei  strains analyzed in the present study were excellent laccase producers and showed 
diverse responses to the different inducers examined. Responses of these strains depend on 
their physiology and genetic and ecological characteristics (Elisashvili et al., 2010). In addition, 
different concentrations of inducers differentially induce laccase production. Different compounds 
induce different responses in basidiomycete fungi (Chen et al., 2003); therefore, no compound can 
be used as a universal inducer of enzyme synthesis by these fungi. Therefore, it is important to 
analyze different potential compounds and not discard effective laccase inducers during the initial 
screening steps.
Different  A. blazei  strains examined in the present study grew well in the presence of 
all the inducers evaluated (Table 3). Although pyrogallol and xylidine decreased laccase activity, 
they stimulated biomass production. Bolag and Leonowicz (1984) observed that xylidine did not 
exert any effect on biomass production by Fomes annosus , Pholiota mutabilis , P. ostreatus , and T. 
versicolor . Similarly, other authors (Elisashvili et al., 2010) did not observe any changes in biomass 
production by C. unicolor  in the presence of pyrogallol, vanillin, or xylidine. Veratryl alcohol was 
the only compound that did not affect biomass production by any strain. Ethanol stimulated the 
growth of A. blazei  U2-2 and A. blazei  U2-4, which was in contrast to that observed by Lomascolo 
et al. (2003) who reported 70% reduction in the radial growth of Pycnoporus cinnabarinus  in the 
presence of ethanol.

In conclusion, different culture conditions significantly affected laccase production by A. 
blazei  strains. A. blazei  U2-4 produced high laccase levels in a medium containing glucose (10 g/L), 
nitrogen supplied as urea (2.8 g/L), and copper supplied as CuSO4 (150 µM). All the compounds 
examined in this study differentially induced laccase production. Moreover, we observed that the 
same compound functioned as an inducer or a repressor depending on the fungal strain used. 
Ethanol, guaiacol, veratryl alcohol, and vanillin induced laccase activity while pyrogallol and 
xylidine had no effect on laccase activity.15890
