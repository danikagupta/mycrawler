Abstract: The contamination of untreated leachate effluent is a potential source to effect of soil, 
surface and groundwater.In this study, the treatment of landfill leachate by electro-Fenton (EF) method 
was studied. The objectives of the study are to determine the optimum current density, the optimum treatment time, the optimum pH, the optimum hydrogen peroxide (H
2O2) dosage and the optimum 
ferrous sulphate heptahydrate (FeSO 4 •7H 2O) dosage of landfill leachate samples using aluminium 
electrode. From the results, it is verified that electro-Fenton method (EF) can used efficiently to degrade leachate organics. The best removal efficiencies were obtained when current density value is 
200 A/m
2, treatment time is 25 min and pH value is 4. The optimum dose of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) 
is 800 mg/L which was obtained 78% and 96% of COD and colour removal efficiency respectively. The optimum ferrous ion (Fe

INTRODUCTION 
 
Recently, the industrial and commercial growth in many countries has been affected in the increases of both 
municipal and industrial solid waste generations. Percentage composition of solid waste is different between 
areas because it is influenced by several factors such as location, community attitudes, frequency of collection, legal systems, population characteristics, socio-economic and lifestyle. Up to 95% of solid waste generated 
worldwide is currently disposed in landfill (Bohdziewicz and Kwarciak, 2008). Leachate is a high strength 
wastewater which has been recognized as one of the most concerned pollution sources. Landfill leachate is the hazardous and heavily polluted wastewater, formed as a result of percolation of rainwater and moisture through solid waste in the landfill site (Bohdziewicz and Kwarciak, 2008; Amuda, 2006). Landfill leachate contain high load of organic matter, high content ammonia nitrogen, heavy metals, inorganic salts and chlorinated organic. 
The composition of leachate depends on age of landfill, hydrogeology of the site, quality and quantity of solid 
waste, site climate, season, biological and chemical processes occurring in the landfill and the amount of precipitation and percolation of rainwater, landfill morpology, waste depth, landfill condition and operation of 
facilities (Li et al.,  2010).  Lately, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been studies because of their 
ability to generate radical intermediate compounds. The radical intermediate compounds contain highly oxidative species which are capability to oxidize toxic pollutants into harmless species. Technologies of 
oxidation processes such as Fenton oxidation, photo-oxidation and electro-oxidation are recurrently applied to 
increase efficiency of electro-chemical methods in order for degradation and decolourization of wastewater.  
Today, there has been an increases focus on the use of electro-chemical methods which can produce OH• as 
the main oxidizing agent ( Brillas et al.,  2000; Kraft et al.,  2003; Mohajeri et al.,  2010). One of the promising of 
ability to degrade pollutants effectively is electro-Fenton (EF). Electro-fenton (EF) method has been applied with combination of fenton oxidation and electrochemical are carried out together and each of them is a 
powerful treatment method (Atmaca, 2009;  Brillas and Casado, 2002; Mohajeri et al.,  2010). This process is 
use of electrically assisted Fenton reaction will produce more OH• radicals and the oxidation of the organics to CO
2 can be enhanced in the same period  (Mohajeri et al.,  2010; Liu et al ., 2007). Normally, there are two 
different electro-Fenton (EF) applications. In the first one the Fenton’s reagents (Fe (II) and H 2O2) are added to 
the reactor from outside and inert electrodes having high catalytic activity are used as anode material. In the second one, H
2O2 is added from outside and Fe (II) is provided from sacrificial cast iron anodes. In the electro-
Fenton process, hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is produced in the required amount from the electrochemical 
reduction of oxygen. Hydroxyl free radical is generated by interaction of H 2O2 with ferrous salts namely the 
Fenton reagent. 
The objective of this study was to examine the efficiency of electro-Fenton process for removal of COD 
and colour from landfill leachate. The experiments involved with the determination of current density, treatment 
time, pH, dose of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and  ferrous sulphate heptahydrate (FeSO 4•7H 2O) on identification Aust. J. Basic & Appl. Sci., 7(8): 263-268, 2013  
 
264 of the optimum experimental conditions for the efficient application of these processes. In this study, the used of 
aluminium plate as electrodes.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Preparation of Sample: 
The study was conducted on leachate samples from Simpang Re nggam municipal landfill site in Johor.  
This site located at latitude 10 53’41.64” North and longitude 1030 22’34.68” East in Kluang district, Johor State, 
Malaysia. Sample has been taken and stored according to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water 
and Wastewater (APHA, AWWA, WEF, 2005). Leachate samples were taken from landfill site by using a submersible pump is submerged at a depth 1500 mm from the surface leachate site. Landfill leachate samples 
are collected and stored in bottles and kept in a room at 4°C prior to use to avoid degradation or changes to its 
characteristics. The initial characteristics of COD and colour for landfill leachate samples were determined. 
Table 1  were shown the initial characteristics of the raw landfill leachate.

Experiment Set Up: 
The electro-Fenton experiments were using 1000 mL beakers as reactors with the diameter of 11 cm by 
vertically positioned Al-Al electrode spaced by 5 cm which carried out on laboratory scale. The electrodes 
dimension of each electrode was 200 mm  50 mm  1 mm made of aluminium are connected to a digital direct 
current (DC) power supply (MPS 3030DD Model) in bipolar (Al-Al) electrode modes. A direct current (DC) power supply was used to provide the desired current. Initial leachate pH was adjusted to the desired values with concentrated sulphuric acid or sodium hydroxide before adding Fenton reagents. The anodes and cathodes are 
connected to the positive and negative outlets of a DC power supply. The total effective working areas are 0.010 
m
2 when immersed 10 cm into the leachate sample. In each run, a pre-decided amount of ferrous sulphate 
heptahydrate (FeSO 4 •7H 2O) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) were added into leachate samples to activate 
electro-Fenton reactions before the electrical current was turned on. The leachate was stirred thoroughly with a 
magnetic stirrer. At an appropriate time intervals, DC power supply was turned off and the reactions was terminated. At the end of each run, the sample were allowed to stand 30 minutes settling time and the 
supernatant was then taken for water quality measurements. COD was measured using a DR5000 
spectrophotometer (HACH spectrophotometer) and colour was measured using same spectrophotometer at 465nm wavelength.  
 
Apparatus: 
Reactor (glass tank): 
One liter glass beaker is used as the reactor tank in the experimental studies. 
 
Electrodes: 
Aluminum electrodes are used in the electrocoagulation process as plates for the anodes and cathodes with 
the dimension of 200 mm high  50 mm wide  1 mm thick. 
 
pH: 
HACH Sension3 pH meter is used to determine the pH of the POME samples. To obtain the optimum pH 
value, the pH of landfill leachate samples was adjusted by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or sulphuric acid 
(H
2SO 4).  
 
Chemical Oxygen Demand and Colour Analyses: 
COD and colour analyses are performed in accordance to the standard methods described in (APHA, 
AWWA, WEF, 2005) with the use of DR 5000 spectrophotometer.

265 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Optimum Current Density: 
Figure 1 was shown the optimum current density on the removal efficiency of COD and colour for Al-Al.  
In this study, the optimum current density is 200 A/m2 which was obtained 74% and 96 % of COD and colour 
removal respectively. Amount of current density is an important operation condition to electrodes. According to 
Atmaca (2009), since the current was applied to electrodes increases, pro duction of Fe (II) required for Fenton 
oxidation becomes higher. Nevertheless, under high DC current applying, the efficiency may not change 
significantly while energy consumption of the method increased. From the results, there are closed readings 
each other of 150 A/m2, 200 A/m2 and 250 A/m2. As expected, it was found that the removal efficiency 
increased with the increase of current density.  
However, after 200 A/m2 the removal efficiency for COD and colour was decreased. COD removal 
increases when the high of current use but speed of the COD removal will be slow down when the current 
higher than 200 A/m2. There is similar result with Atmaca (2009) and Zhang et al., ( 2006). This phenomenon 
was caused by the interfere reactions. However, interfer e reactions can be reduced by using the proper Fe 
(II)/H 2O2 and Fe (III)/H 2O2 ratios and initial pH. According to Boye (2003) and Brillas et al.,  (2004) the 
decreased in current efficiency is because of the formation of hardly oxidizable products.

            mg/L, Fe2+ 600 mg/L, distances between electrodes 5 cm and settling time 30 minutes. 
 
Optimum Treatment Time: 
Figure 2 were shown the optimum treatment time on the removal efficiency of COD and colour for Al-
Al.The best removal efficiencies were obtained when treatment time is 25 minutes. COD and colour were 
achieved 73 % and 95 % removal respectively. The results showed that the removal efficiency of COD and colour has decreased when treatment time over than 25 minutes. Zhang (2007) has been investigated of 
hydrogen peroxide added in a single step and in a continuous mode with feeding time. From their results, the 
initial COD removal rate increased with the decreasing feeding time and it reached highest when hydrogen peroxide was applied all at once. Also that, the decrease of feeding time, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide 
during the initial period would increase.  
This phenomenon will be more hydroxyl radicals would be generated resulting from the chain reaction 
between hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ion. According to Lin and Chang (2000) the treatment time is to complete the oxidation reaction largely due to the dosage of H
2O2. In general, the time to terminate the electro-
Fenton can vary significantly with the increases amount of H 2O2.  Besides that, Zhang et al.,  (2006) was 
indicated the process of electro-Fenton very fast in the first 15- 30 minutes and then slowed down till it was complete in 75 minutes.

pH 3, H 2O2 600 mg/L, Fe2+  600 mg/L, distances between electrodes 5 cm, and settling time of 30 
minutes. 
 
Optimum Initial pH: 
In the electro-Fenton process, pH is an important operation parameter on removal of COD and colour. The 
function of pH is to controls the production of the hydroxyl radical and the concentration of ferrous ions in the 
solution. Figure 3 were shown the optimum pH on the removal efficiency of COD and colour for Al-Al. The optimum pH was found at pH 4 which was achieved 74 % and 96 % of COD and colour respectively. From the 
results, the low removal COD and colour decreased at pH>4. It is similar by Lin and Chang (2000) were 
obtained the removal decreased for initial pH>4. From this results, it is clearly seen that pH 3, 4 and 5 is very closed each other on removal efficiency of COD and colour. In general, many researcher have been found that 
Fenton’s reaction occur in low pH values between 2 and 4 (Mohajeri et al.,  2010; Atmaca, 2009; Zhang et al., 
2006; Gosh et al., 2011; Aziz et al.,  2012; Lopez et al.,  2004; Deng, 2007).  
When the pH value has been increased, the iron ions of Fe
3+ precipitate, which slow down the regeneration 
of ferrous ions. As a result, the amount catalyst of Fe nton’s reaction will be decreases. In fact, hydrogen 
peroxide is unstable in basic solution and possibly will itself rapidly decompose to water and oxygen as pH >5 (Mohajeri et al.,  2010; Nidheesh and Gandhimathi, 2012). It is show that the stable hydroxyl radicals are 
produced at pH values of 2-4 and that high oxidizing potential was exhibited in this pH range ( Zhang, 2007;  
Badawwy and Ali, 2006). According to Zhang (2006) and Rivas et al.,  (2004) the pH>4, H
2O2 decomposes in a 
different manner without any contribution to oxidation reactions.

time 25 minutes, H 2O2  600 mg/L, Fe2+  600 mg/L, distances between electrodes 5 cm and settling time of 
30 minutes. 
 
Effect of H 2O2 Dosage: 
The dosage of H 2O2 is an important part in the electro-Fenton process. The increased of H 2O2 concentration 
ability to remove more pollutants in wastewater. It is due to the increase in hydroxyl radical concentrations as a 
result of the addition of H 2O2.  According to Zhang (2007) the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide for degrades Aust. J. Basic & Appl. Sci., 7(8): 263-268, 2013  
 
267 organic pollutants in the leachate decreased with the increase of Fenton’s reagent dosage. At the high dosage of 
H2O2, the decrease in removal efficiency was due to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effects of H 2O2 and the 
recombination of the hydroxyl radical. The results showed that the best removal efficiency of COD and colour is 
800 mg/L of H 2O2 dosage which are obtained 78% and 97% of COD and colour removal respectively. It is seen 
that, the removal efficiency were increased when the dosage has been increased. However, a higher oxidant 
doses higher than optimum dose cannot provide adequate results. It is similar results reported by Ghosh et al.,  
(2011). From their study, they were obtained 1530 mg/L of optimum H 2O2 dosage and a higher oxidant dose of 
3825 mg/L did not lead to higher COD reduction. 
 
 
 
Fig. 4:  Effects of H 2O2 dosage on COD and colour removal efficiency for Al-Al  at current density 200 A/m2, 
treatment time 25 minutes, pH 4, dose of  Fe2+ 1200 mg/L, distances between electrodes 5 cm and settling 
time of 30 minutes.  
Effect of Fe
2+ Dosage: 
In electro-Fenton process, ferrous ion concentration is requirement to generate this process (Zhou et al.,  
2007). Figure 5 has been showed the effect of Fe2+ concentration on removal of COD and colour. The optimum 
Fe2+ concentration is 1000 mg/L for 75% of COD and 95% of colour removal respectively. Usually, the 
efficiency of electro-Fenton process increases with Fe2+ concentration because the concentration hydroxyl 
radical (Wang et al.,  2010). The main oxidizing agent (H 2O2) in the electro-Fenton process increases with the 
increase in Fe2+ concentration. The excess of ferrous ion use in the electrolyte solution can consume the 
hydroxyl radicals and affect the extent of degradation (Nidheesh and Gandhimathi, 2012). After the electro-
Fenton process the excess amount of Fe2+/ Fe3+ will be contamination for soil and groundwater because the 
excess amount of Fe2+/ Fe3+ produces extra amount of sludge and increase total dissolved solids and electrical 
conductivity.

settling time of 30 minutes.

268 Conclusion: 
Optimum condition for electro-Fenton process were found at current density 200 A/m2, treatment time 25 
minutes, pH 4, H 2O2 dosage 800 mg/L and Fe2+ dosage 1000 mg/L. Hence, electro-Fenton is recommended as a 
powerful technique for the degradation and decolorization of landfill leachate.
