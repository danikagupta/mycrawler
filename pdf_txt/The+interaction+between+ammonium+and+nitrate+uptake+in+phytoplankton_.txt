The interaction between ammonium and nitrate 
uptake in phytoplankton 
Quay Dortch

ABSTRACT. A basic tenet of nitrogen utilization in phytoplankton is that ammoniuln inhibits nitrate 
uptake. Consequently, it is generally believed that little or no nitrate uptake occurs at ammonium 
concentrations above ca 1 yM. A thorough review of field studies shows that the reduction of nitrate 
uptake rate in the presence of ammonium is rarely so severe, and that it is a highly variable 
phenomenon. To simplify quantification of the interaction between nitrate and ammonium uptake, it is 
proposed that it be divided into an indirect interaction, preference, and a direct effect, inhibition. In 
order to determine preference and inhibition it is necessary to measure uptake of each inorganic 
nitrogen source alone and in the presence of increasing concentrations of the other nitrogen source. 
Preference for ammonium uptake is manifested primarily in a higher V,,,,, and lower K, for ammonium 
uptake than for nitrate uptake and is accentuated by low light and low nitrogen availability. However, 
although ammonium is the preferred nitrogen source for uptake, growth rates on nitrate usually equal or 
exceed those on ammonium. Inhibition of nitrate uptake by ammonium is much more variable, but 
when separated from preference is less extreme. It is also enhanced by low light, but unlike preference, 
it is greater when phytoplankton are N sufficient. Species differences are apparent for both preference 
and inhibition, but there are only enough data for preference to determine how it varies among algal 
groups. Finally, there are reports of low concentrations of ammonium stimulating nitrate uptake and of 
nitrate inhibiting ammonium uptake. Such unexpected interactions along with variations in preference 
and inhibition with species composition and environmental conditions may account for the variability 
observed in field studies and will not be explainable or predictable until more is known about the 
underlying biochemical mechanisms. Even though it is not possible at present to model nitrate uptake 
accurately because of uncertainty about the interaction between ammonluln and nitrate uptake, it is 
quite evident that the simplistic view that nitrate uptake is reduced to zero if ammonium exceeds 1 1iM 
would often result in large underestimates of nitrate uptake and new production. 
INTRODUCTION 
Itis generally believed that the rateof nitrate uptake by 
phytoplankton is severely reduced by the presence of 
ammonium. This effect is referred to either as 'inhibition' 
of nitrate uptake by ammonium or 'preference' for 
ammonium, and in its most extreme form it is believed to 
result in no nitrate uptake above a threshold ammonium 
concentration of ca 1 PM. Evidence for the negative effect 
of ammonium on nitrate utilization arises from 3 sources: 
(1) early laboratory studies of nitrate utilization in fresh- 
water green algae (reviewed in Morris 1974), (2) early 
field studies in marine ecosystems (Table l), and (3) 
theoretical considerations of the relative energy require- ments for the utilization of nitrate and ammonium, due to 
the number of electrons required to reduce nitrate to 
ammonium (Losado & Guerrero 1979, Syrett 1981). In 
many of these early studies it was assumed that nitrate 
uptake (transport into the cell) and reduction were so 
tightly coupled that uptake of nitrate must be inhibited 
by ammonium because the enzyme nitrate reductase is 
strongly inhibited. It is now known that nitrate uptake 
and reduction are frequently uncoupled during transient 
conditions in marine phytoplankton (DeManche et al. 
1979, Dortch et al. 1979, Collos 1982) and that nitrogen 
uptake and assimilation are so complex that it is difficult 
to explain the interaction between nitrate and 
ammonium uptake by one simple mechanism.

all 3 ratios, when estimated at 1 !tM, can be used to 
judge the severity of the effect of ammonium on nitrate 
uptake. The concentration of 1 ~IM was chosen because 
it is most often cited as the threshold ammonium con- 
centration that results in a pronounced decrease in 
nitrate uptake rate. The f-ratios with urea are included 
to maximize the data available, although the presence 
of urea complicates interpretation in terms of the 
interaction between nitrate and ammonium. 
Several conclusions are immediately evident. (1) 
Somelmes nitrate uptake in the presence of l ~IM 
ammonium is considerably lower than ammonium 
uptake, although rarely zero. (2) However, the degree 
to which nitrate uptake is affected by ammonium is 
quite variable and nitrate uptake at 1 yM ammonium 
can equal or exceed ammonium uptake rates (VNO;/ 
VNH; >l). In fact, sometimes nitrate uptake is not 
related to ammonium concentration (Goering et al. 
1970, Harvey & Caperon 1976, Ronner et al. 1983, 
Kokkinakis & Wheeler 1987, Kristiansen & Lund 1989). 
Furthermore, nitrate uptake may also be stimulated by 
ammonium (Glibert et al. 1982b). (3) The ratio of 
(nitrate uptake in the presence of 1 FM ammonium)/ 
(nitrate uptake in the absence of ammonium), tends to 
show a less negative effect of ammonium than the other 
ratios in Table 1 This is because the f-ratio and nitrate/ 
ammonium uptake ratios combine several processes 
('preference' and 'inhibition') involved in the nitrate/ 
ammonium interaction, whereas the ratio of nitrate 
uptake with and without ammonium measure only 
'inhibition', as will be discussed in a following section. 
Other reports of simultaneous uptake of nitrate and 
ammonium (Conover 1975b, Kuenzler et al. 1979, Har- 
rison et al. 1982, 1983, 1985, Price et al. 1985, Collos et 
al. 1989) and a preference for nitrate over ammonium 
(Warfar et al. 1983. Harrison et al. 1987) could not be 
readily tabulated in the format of Table 1 because the 
data necessary for companson were not included. 
Another common method of assessing the interaction 
of nitrate and ammonium uptake is to calculate the 
relative preference index (RPI) for a nitrogen source 
(McCarthy et al. 1977), 
wherePNor = thenitrateuptake rate; Zp, = thesumof the 
uptake rates measured for all nitrogen sources; [NO11 = 
the ambient nitrate concentration; and [Xh.] = the sum of 
the concentrations of all the nitrogen sources measured. 
Values < 1 indicate preference for ammonium and > 1 
preference for nitrate. There are a number of problems with this ratio which make it difficult to interpret. (1) It 
cannot bt? calculated if the ambient nitrate is undetect- 
able, which is precisely the time when nitrate migh.t be 
preferred, thus biasing conclusions. (2) The precision of 
the RP1 is low because of the error which results from 
combining so many variables (Collos & Slawyk 1986). (3) 
Its numerical value can change in response to ambient 
nitrogen concentrations without any changes in uptake 
rate, so it does not necessarily have a physiological or 
ecological basis (Paasche 1988). (4) This ratio is often 
treated as an indicator of inhibition, so that low values are 
interpreted as meaning that little or no nitrate uptake 
occurs, whereas in fact it is an indicator of preference and 
simply means that ammonium uptake proceeds at a 
faster rate than nitrate uptake (see following sections for 
further discussion). In general the RPINo; is usually < 1 
(McCarthy et al. 1977, Paasche & Kristiansen 1982, 
Furnas 1983, Glibert & McCarthy 1984, Carpenter & 
Dunham 1985, Cochlan 1986, Whalen & Alexander 1986, 
Pennock 1987, Dortch & Postel 1989a). However, in a 
very thorough study Harrison et al. (1987) compiled their 
data from many different areas (467 measurements), and 
obtained an overall RPINO; of 0.97. Plotted by region it 
was significantly > 1, indicating nitrate preference, for 2 
areas (Mid-Atlantic Bight, Peru), < 1, indicating prefer- 
ence for ammonium, for 3 studies (S. California Bight, 
Scotian Shelf, Bedford Basin), and not significantly 
different from l, for 3 studies (E. Canadi.an Arctic 1978, 
1980, Vineyard Sound). Less extensive data sets suggest 
that the RPINo; approaches 1 whennitrate concentrations 
are high during the spring or as a result of mixing or 
upwelling (Carpenter & Dunham 1985, Pennock 1987, 
Dortch & Postel 1989a) or when phytoplankton are 
nitrogen deficient (McCarthy et al. 1977, Paasche & 
Kristiansen 1982, Furnas 1983, Glibert & McCarthy 1984, 
Cochlan 1986, Whalen & Alexander 1986). 
It has been hypothesized that nitrate will be preferred 
or simultaneous uptake will be more likely in benthic 
diatoms (Admiraal et al. 1987), coastal phytoplankton 
(Pennock et al. 198f), large diatoms (Malone 1980, 
Kokkinakis & Wheeler 1987), or phytoplankton exposed 
to frequent high pulses of both nitrate and ammonium 
(Maestrini et al. 1986, Queguiner et al. 1986). There are 
too few data in Table 1 to generalize about the effect of 
species preferences on regional variability, although the 
question of species preference will be considered In later 
sections when laboratory data are reviewed. Similarly, 
some of the data in Table 1 suggest that environmental 
conditions, such as llght and nitrogen availability, should 
influence the interaction. Since it is difficult to quantify 
these factors in the field, their influence will also be 
determined from a revi.ew of laboratory results. 
In concIusion, the original pa,radigm that nitrate 
uptake decreases to very low levels or is effectively 
zero at ammonium concentrations greater than 1 ~IM is Dortch: Ammonium and nitrate uptake 187 
not supported by the available data. Furthermore, there 
is enormous variability in the degree to which 
ammonium does affect nitrate uptake which is not 
adequately explained by current models. 
REDEFINING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN 
AMMONIUM AND NITRATE UPTAKE 
The interaction between ammonium and nitrate 
uptake can be simplified by dividing it into 2 distinct 
processes: an indirect interaction, which will be termed 
preference, and a direct interaction, which will be 
called inhibition. These 2 interactions are not mutually 
exclusive; one or both can occur in phytoplankton. 
They are, however, influenced differently by environ- 
mental conditions, and vary in importance from species 
to species. It is reasonably easy to measure preference 
and inhibition separately in the lab, but much more 
difficult in the field because it is necessary to measure 
uptake of nitrate and ammonium in the absence of the 
other, a condition rarely met in the field. 
Preference for ammonlum over nitrate means that 
ammonium is more readily utilized than nitrate. Prefer- 
ence is independent of the ammonium concentration, 
and, in fact, can only be assessed by measuring nitrate 
uptake in the absence of ammonium and ammonium 
uptake in the absence of nitrate. Although this review 
is concerned primarily with interactions between 
nitrate and ammonium uptake, uptake measurements, 
especially in the field, are often made over time periods 
long enough to encompass uptake, assimilation, and 
growth. Since the interaction between these processes 
is complex, preference for one nitrogen source could be 
manifested in a variety of ways. The maximum rate 
(V,,,,) for uptake of one nitrogen source may be higher 
or the half-saturation constant (K,) may be lower than 
for the other nitrogen source. There could be a time lag 
in either the uptake or assimilation of one nitrogen 
source that is not observed with the other. Finally. 
growth rates might be greater on one nitrogen source 
than the other. Any one or all of these indicate a true 
preference for a particular nitrogen source. While 
uptake or growth on the preferred nitrogen source 
would be greater, uptake and growth on the other 
nitrogen source can still occur, sometimes at rapid 
rates, and independent of the concentration of the 
preferred nitrogen source. 
Inhibition results when the presence of one nitrogen 
source prevents or reduces the uptake of the other. It can 
only be quantified by comparing the uptake rate in the 
absence of the inhibiting nitrogen source with uptake 
rates in the presence of increasing concentrations of the 
inhibitor. Thus, unlike preference, inhibition is depen- 
dent on the concentration of the inhibitor. Although inhibition is a term with a very precise biochemical 
meaning related to a particular mechanism of interac- 
tion, no such mechanism is implied here by its use. 
Despite considerable research in this area, no mechan- 
ism(~) has been proposed which can adequately explain 
the complex interaction. Separating preference from 
inhibition is a first simplification since the mechanisms 
involved in each process are clearly quite different. 
Each may be affected at more than one step in the 
uptake and assimilation pathways and involve both 
short-term and long-term processes, all of which vary 
from species to species and with environmental condi- 
tions. Thus, in this review an empirical approach to 
quantifying inhibition and preference will be taken 
which does not require greater understanding of the 
underlying biochemical mechanisms. 
METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN QUANTIFYING 
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AMMONIUM AND 
NITRATE UPTAKE 
In the following sections the available lab and field 
data on preference and inhibition xvill be reviewed. 
However, there are methodological problems which 
complicate the interpretation of this data, aside from 
the already complicated nitrate/ammonium uptake in- 
teraction. 
(1) Preference and inhibition cannot be separated and 
quantified if controls involving nitrate uptake alone 
and ammonium uptake alone are not measured. 
This is difficult and often impossible in the field and 
rarely done in the lab. 
(2) Both preference and inhibition can involve one or 
more steps in the nitrogen uptake, assimilation, 
and growth pathways. Depending on the time 
period over which 'uptake' measurements are 
made, some assimilation and growth are also meas- 
ured. How this affects measurements of preference 
and inhibition in different species and under differ- 
ent conditions is probably quite variable. 
(3) Due to problems with calculating nitrogen uptake 
rates, inhibition may appear to be greatest during 
simultaneous uptake of nitrate and ammonium 
(Dortch 1980, Collos 1987, Lund 1987). 
(4) Both V,,, and K, for uptake are difficult to meas- 
ure, especially in the field, since the rates of nitrate 
and ammonium uptake vary with time, and the 
variation is influenced by nitrogen supply and 
possibly other environmental variables (reviewed 
by Collos 1983, Goldman & Glibert 1983). In addi- 
tion, there is often a large statistical uncertainty 
associated with estimates of K,. 
(5) Regeneration of ammonium (and possibly nitrate?) 
during incubations to measure nitrogen uptake in 188 Mar Ecol. Prog. Ser. 61: 183-201, 1990 
the field certainly affects ammonium uptake rates 
(Glibert et al. 1982c) and may also affect the rela- 
tive rates of nitrate and ammonium uptake. 
(6) In the field variations in environmental conditions 
which affect nitrate and ammonium uptake, but 
cannot be easily quantified, can mask the effect of 
ammonium on nitrate uptake. 
(7) Both in the lab and the field a variety of methods 
and protocols have been used for measuring nitro- 
gen uptake which may make comparisons difficult. 
The data, which will be discussed in the next section, 
are subject, to different degrees, to these problems, 
which probably enhances the apparent variability in 
inhibitiodpreference, especially in the field where 
experimental conditions are under less control. Future 
experiments must minimize these methodological 
problems in order to quantify the interaction between 
nitrate and ammonium uptake. 
ANALYSIS OF EXISTING DATA ON PREFERENCE 
Preference in the laboratory can best be assessed by 
comparing V,,, or maximum growth rates (/h,,) for 
nitrate alone and ammonium alone (Table 2; Antia et 
al. 1975). The V,,, for ammonium uptake usually 
exceeds (by up to 11 times) or equals the V,,, for 
nitrate uptake (only 4 exceptions). Despite this marked 
preference for uptake of ammonium, out of the 70 
reports of relative growth rate on nitrate and 
ammonium (Table 2; Antia et al. 1975), 22 indicate 
better growth and 30 show the same growth on nitrate 
compared with ammonium under some, but not neces- 
sarily all, environmental conditions. The data for 14C 
uptake during growth on nitrate and ammonium are 
too scanty (6 species) for comparison with the relative 
,ha,, although in no case is I4C uptake on nitrate 
greater than ammonium. If the 14C uptake data are 
ignored, preference for ammonium is manifested 
primarily at the level of uptake rather than growth. 
It was hypothesized that a low K, for nitrate uptake in 
comparison with ammonium uptake would indicate 
preference for nitrate. However, in 16 out of 29 meas- 
urements the K, for nitrate exceeds that of ammonium. 
Not only does this demonstrate again a lack of prefer- 
ence for nitrate, it is contrary to the prediction of Eppley 
et al. (196913) that a low V,,,, 1.n this case for nitrate 
(Table 2), would be paired with a low K,. A low K, for 
nitrate may not be required if nitrate is usually supplied 
sporadically at high concentrations (Dortch et al. 1982). 
Thus, both the K, and V,,, for nitrate uptake indicate a 
lack of preference for nitrate uptake. 
There are just enough data to compare the relative 
!h,, and V,,, for diatoms, dinoflagellates, cyanobac- 
teria, chlorophytes, and others (Table 3). All but one group, the chlorophytes, show a preference for 
ammonium uptake but not for growth on ammonium. 
The greatest extremes in this contrast are the diatoms 
and the 'Other' category, comprised primarily of small 
flagellates. This is not inconsistent with Malone's (1980) 
hypothesis that large diatoms would show a preference 
for growth on nitrate and other studies which show that 
ammonium may be taken up preferentially by small 
phytoplankton (Glibert et al. 198213, Harrison et al. 1983, 
Nalewajko & Garside 1983, Probyn 1985, Koike et al. 
1986, LeBouteiller 1986, Sahlsten 1987, Harrison & 
Wood 1988, Kokkinakis & Wheeler 1988, Dortch & 
Poste1 1989a, Dodds et al. unpubl.), although such 
preference is not always observed (Furnas 1983, Ronner 
et al. 1983, Probyn & Painting 1985). 
In the field the only indicators of preference which can 
be examined are the K, and V,,, for uptake (Table 4). 
Since in the field measurement of uptake of one nitrogen 
source in the absence of the other is often not possible, 
these measures of preference are not entirely free of the 
possible influence of inhibition. However, the results are 
essentially the same as in the laboratory cultures. The 
V,,, for ammonium uptake exceeds or equals that for 
nitrate uptake in all cases except for two in upwelling 
areas. In general the values approach 1 (indicating equal 
uptake of nitrate and ammonium at saturat~ng concen- 
trations) only in the spring or in upwelling areas, which is 
consistentwith the hypothesis that thelarge phytoplank- 
ton that bloom in those places or times depend mainly on 
nitrate (Malone 1980). As in the lab, the K, values for 
nitrate generally exceed or equal those for ammonium, 
indicating little preference for ammonium. 
The 'Comments' in Tables 2 and 4, and other data 
which could not be easily categorized in the tables, 
show that preference can be modified considerably by 
environmental conditions. Nitrogen deficiency elevates 
the V,,, for ammonium uptake (reviewed in Collos 
1983, Goldman & Glibert 1983). The effect on V,,, for 
nitrate is quite variable (Dortch et al. 1982, Collos 1983, 
Parslow et al. 1984) but in general there is at most a 
small increase and, often, a decrease. Thus, nitrogen 
deficiency may dramatically increase the preference 
for ammonium. Further, when ambient nitrogen is 
depleted, small phytoplankton often predominate, 
which, as mentioned above, may prefer ammonium. 
Since nitrate reduction can take up to one third of 
photosynthetically produced reducing power (Losada 
& Guerrero 1979, Syrett 1981), it can be postulated that 
preference for ammonium would be greater at low 
light. Certainly, ammonium uptake appears to be less 
light-dependent than nitrate uptake, with higher dark 
uptake rates and less variation with light intensity 
(Goering et al. 1964, Caperon & Ziemann 1976, Cloern 
1977, Kuenzler et al. 1979, Nelson & Conway 1979,

Paasche et al. 1984, Whalen & Alexander 1984, Kanda 
et al. 1985, Koike et al. 1986, Fisher et al. 1988), 
although, again there are exceptions (Garside 1981. 
Glibert et al. 1982a, Collos & Slawyk 1986, McCarthy & 
Nevins 1986, Sahlsten 1987). For the few studies in 
which preference can be assessed directly at different 
light levels (Table 2), 5 species show increased prefer- 
ence for ammonium at low light, one no difference, and 
one less preference. However, one other species, 
Thalassiosira pseudonana, showed greater preference 
for ammonium at low light when maximum uptake 
rates (Yin 1988) were compared but decreased prefer- 
ence for ammonium at low light when growth rates 
were considered (Thompson et al. 1989). Since prefer- 
ence for ammonium may be generally more evident 
with uptake than growth, care must be taken in assess- 
ing the effect of light on preference until there is more 
data for relati.ve V,,,, at different light levels. 
Temperature can also affect the relative rates of 
nitrate and ammonium uptake, but there is no consen- 
sus about which is more temperature-dependent 
(Cloern 1977, Kuenzler et al. 1979, Olson 1980, Tisch- 
ner 1981, Glibert et al. 1982b, Whalen & Alexander 
1984, Kanda et al. 1985). 
In summary, preference for ammonium is manifested 
primarily in a higher V,,, and a lower K, for 
ammonium uptake than nitrate uptake. Preference for 
ammonium uptake is not universal, and is least likely in 
the spring in temperate regions or in upwelling areas 
when large diatoms are thought to dominate. Furtber- 
more, the most common environmental stresses 
encountered by phytoplankton, low light or low nitro- 
gen availability may increase the preference for 
ammonium uptake. Despite the preference for 
ammonium uptake, growth on nitrate is often as good 
or better than that on ammonium. Finally, there is 
considerable species variation in all aspects of prefer- 
ence. ANALYSIS OF EXISTING DATA ON INHIBITION 
The inhibition of nitrate uptake by ammonium is a 
highly variable process. In laboratory cultures it ranges 
from no inhibition to complete inhibition and depends 
on the species and environmental conditions (Table 5). 
In general, inhibition varies with the degree of nitrogen 
deficiency (Caperon & Meyer 1972, Eppley & Renger 
1974, Bienfang 1975, Conway 1977, Tischner 1981, 
Terry 1982), although Dunaliela tertiolecta (Caperon & 
~Meyer 1972) and Skeletonema costatum (Dortch & 
Conway 1984) are exceptions. The nitrogen source 
used for growth prior to exposure to both nitrate and 
ammonium may predispose phytoplankton to different 
degrees of inhibition (Dortch & Conway 1984, Dortch et 
al. unpubl.). Finally, low light or darkness may increase 
the likelihood of inhibition (Bates 1976, Ohmori et al. 
1977), as would be expected from the earlier discussion 
of the effect of light on preference. However, in Thalas- 
siosira pseudonana ammonium stimulates nitrate 
uptake in low light (Yin 1988). There are no data on the 
variation of inhibition with temperature or size of phy- 
toplankter. Because of the variability in the results in 
Table 5, probably due to the many differences in 
experimental design and conditions, it is not possible to 
infer a pattern to the degree of inhibition for algal 
species, either by size, taxonomic grouping, or location 
where isolated. 
There are very few field studies in which inhibition is 
separated from preference, because of the need to 
compare the nitrate uptake rates with and without 
added ammonium (if ambient ammonium is high, no 
suitable control, is possible). Aga.in it is apparent that 
inhibition (Table 1) is quite variable but almost never 
complete. Further, the degree of inhibition is much less 
than would be expected from the f-ratio (NO: uptake/ 
total N uptake), which combines both inhibition and 
preference. 
The threshold for the effect of ammonium on nitrate 
uptake is quite variable, ranging in cultures from 0.1 to 
90 LIM (Table 5), and in the field from 0.1 to 15 CIM 
(Kuenzler et al. 1979, Toetz 1981, Paasche & Kristian- 
sen 1982, Berman et al. 1984, Prjscu & Priscu 1984, 
Probyn 1985, Lipschultz et al. 1986, Queguiner et al. 
1986, Pennock 1987). Considerable variation would be 
expected in thresholds because they probably result 
from a number of interacting biochemical processes 
(but the cause is currently unknown) and they are 
defined differently in various studies. Regardless, 
nitrate uptake is rarely zero, and is often substantjal, 
even when the threshold is reached. 
Much has been wntten about the biochemical 
mechanism of ammonium inhibition of nitrate uptake. 
Separating preference from inhibition is a first step in 
clarifying the mechanism. It is also simplified by con- Table 4. Preference for nitrate or ammonium uptake in the field. Assumptions and definitions as in Table 2. Where possible ratios are calculated from paired experiments on

sidering the regulation of uptake separately from 
assimilation. Even so, it is possible to hypothesize a 
number of mechanisms (Table 5). This is not just an 
academic question for several reasons. The mechanism 
of inhibition may dictate how inhibition is affected by 
environmental conditions. For example, if nitrate and 
ammonium uptake compete for energy for transport 
across the cell membrane (Ohmori et al. 1977, Terry 
1982), then inhibition should be greatest in low light 
or in the dark. As a second example, if external 
ammonium is a competitive inhibitor of nitrate uptake, 
the inhibition should be overcome by increasing the 
nitrate concentration, but if ammonium is a non-com- 
petitive inhibitor, then no amount of nitrate will 
decrease the inhibition. As mentioned in a previous 
section, the RPINo; may be highest when phytoplank- 
ton are nitrogen-limited and concentrations of all forms 
of nitrogen are low (McCarthy et al. 1977, Paasche & 
Kristiansen 1982, Furnas 1983, Glibert & McCarthy 
1984, Cochlan 1986, MJhalen & Alexander 1986, Probyn 
1988) or when nitrate concentrations are very high 
(Carpenter & Dunham 1985, Harrison et al. 1987, Pen- 
nock 1987, Collos et al. 1989, Dortch & Poste1 1989a). 
While part of the discrepancy may be due to variations 
in both preference and inhibition, knowledge of the 
mechanism of inhibition might help explain the differ- 
ences. 
The mechanism will also dictate how nitrate uptake 
can be described in a model. Current models fall into 
several distinct categories: (1) a linear relationship 
between nitrate uptake and ammonium concentration; 
(2) a linear relationship between nitrate uptake and 
nitrate and ammonium concentrations, which implies 
competitive inhibition (Harrison et al. 1987, Collos 
1989); (3) a non-linear relationship between nitrate 
uptake and ammonium concentration based on non- 
competitive inhibition (Zevenboom & Mur 1981a, 
Nakamura 1985) or derived empirically (Hofmann & 
Ambler 1988, Dodds et al. unpubl.). In order to compile 
the data in Table 1, all the data from each study cited 
were plotted as a function of ammonium concentration. 
Ideally, the data could have been fit by one of these 
approaches and the £-ratio, ratio of nitrate uptake/ 
ammonium uptake, or inhibition calculated at 1 yM 
ammonium. In practice, even if the data could be fit 
with one of the equations, the fit was generally poor 
because at high ammonium concentrations (> 1 PM) 
there are very few data points. At low ammonium 
concentrations, while some nitrate uptake rates are 
high, most are quite low, implying that other factors 
besides external ammonium are influencing the 
interaction between ammonium and nitrate uptake. 
For example, none of these models can account for 
changes in uptake which occur in response to environ- 
mental conditions nor do they allow for regulation by intracellular mechanisms (Table 5) as well as external 
ammonium. With the renewed interest in using nitrate 
uptake as a measure of new production and carbon flux 
out of the euphotic zone, there is an increased need to 
be able to model nitrate uptake in a way that realisti- 
cally reflects the natural environment. This will only be 
accomplished when the inhibitory mechanism is better 
understood. 
The inhibitory interaction between nitrate and 
ammonium uptake is complicated by 2 other processes. 
Besides ammonium inhibition of nitrate uptake, there 
are also reports that nitrate inhibits ammonium uptake, 
although to a lesser degree (Caperon & Ziemann 1976, 
Ohmori et al. 1977, Terry 1982, Dortch & Conway 1984, 
Yin 1988). Others have not observed such inhibition, 
although they deliberately looked for it (Kuenzler et al. 
1979, Zevenboom & Mur 1981a, Nakamura 1985, Lund 
1987, Dortch et al. unpubl.). Secondly, it appears that 
the presence of, usually, small amounts of ammonium 
may stimulate nitrate uptake, even though larger 
amounts inhibit (Conover 1975b, Caperon & Ziemann

unpubl.). Neither process fits the current view of the 
interaction between nitrate and ammonium uptake. 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, the presence of ammonium does not 
reduce nitrate uptake to the degree which is generally 
believed. The apparent negative effect of ammonium 
on nitrate uptake can be divided into 2 quite distinct 
processes, preference for ammonium and inhibition of 
nitrate uptake by ammonium. Some of what has been 
called 'inhibition' in the past is really the indirect result 
of preference for ammonium, manifested primarily in a 
higher V,, and a lower K, for ammonium uptake than 
nitrate uptake. Inhibition, resulting from the direct 
effect of ammonium on nitrate uptake, does occur, but 
is generally much less extreme and more variable a 
phenomenon than has been generally appreciated. 
There is considerable variation between species in 
both inhibition and preference to which there is at 
present no apparent pattern. Furthermore, both are 
strongly influenced by environmental conditions. It can 
be hypothesized from the available data that prefer- 
ence for ammonium will be maximal with low light and 
nitrogen deficiency, whereas inhibition will be maxi- 
mal with nitrogen sufficiency and low light. However, it 
is already apparent that some species are exceptions to 
these generalizations. Finally, it is difficult to incorpo- 
rate the possibilities that ammonium stimulates nitrate 
uptake or that nitrate inhibits ammonium uptake 
within the framework of the current paradigm. 
Although the interaction between nitrate anc 198 Mar Ecol. Prog. Ser. 61: 183-201, 1990 
ammonium uptake has been studied at length, a funda- 
mental understanding of the interaction is still lacking. 
The review suggests 2 areas where future research 
may be most useful: 
(1) Experiments to determine the specific biochemical 
mechanisms involved in preference and inhibition 
and 
(2) More studies of the variation in preference and 
inhibition with species and environmental condi- 
tions. 
Two methodological recommendations can also be 
made. 
(1) Much of the expenmental work on biochemical 
mechanisms has utilized freshwater, green algal or 
cyanobacterial weed species whose nitrogen utili- 
zation may be quite different from most phyto- 
plankton. A wider variety of more representative 
species should be utilized for these kinds of studies. 
(2) In order to at least separate preference and inhibi- 
tion and to make it possible to observe nitrate 
inhibition of ammonium uptake and stimulation of 
nitrate by ammonium, appropriate controls (nitrate 
uptake alone and ammonium uptake alone) and 
ammonium uptake as a function of nitrate concen- 
tration must also be measured, both in the lab- 
oratory and the field. 
With these recommendations in mind and an 
appreciation for the complexity of the interaction 
between nitrate and ammonium uptake, it should be 
possible to design experiments which will lead to an 
understanding of the underlying biochemical mecha- 
nisms and thus, to a new paradigm to descnbe the 
interaction. This in turn will make it possible to inter- 
pret measurements of nitrate uptake in the field and 
model the relationship of nitrate uptake to productivity 
and phytoplankton processes in the ocean.
