 ABSTRACT  
Wastewater released from textile industries consists of large volume of colored dye 
effluents and it needs to be treated before discharge to the environment by cost 
effective technologies. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising technology for 
the treatment of dye wastewater. Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticle comprising of Ag core and 
TiO 2 shell is a promising photocatalyst. In the present study, Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles 
were engineered to impart and enhance their UV and solar photocatalytic activity for 
efficient photocatalytic degradation of  two azo dyes, namely: Acid Yellow -17(AY -
17) and Reactive Blue -220 (RB -220). Ag@TiO 2 was found to be suitable as 
photocatalyst for UV and solar photocatalysis of these dyes. The engineered 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were characterized by different techniques. A g@TiO 2   with 
an average crystallite size of around 39.33  nm, showed its ability to absorb both UV 
light and visible light. The band gap energy for these nanoparticles was estimated to 
be 1.85eV, which supported its high solar photocatalytic activity. Ag@T iO2 exhibited 
better photocatalytic activity as compared to other conventional catalysts. Operational 
factors such as pH, catalyst loading and oxidant concentration were optimized for 
photocatalysis of these dyes.  Kinetics of photocatalysis of the dyes obe yed modified 
Langmuir -Hinshelwood model.  The rate of photocatalysis of the dyes was inhibited 
by the presence of salts like sodium chloride and sodium carbonate and was enhanced 
by increase in light intensity. Efficient decolorization and mineralization of  AY-17 
and RB -220 were achieved by photocatalysis using Ag@TiO 2. Optimum conditions 
obtained for AY -17 degradation were more favorable for the photocatalysis of water 
contaminated with mixture of these dyes. Degradation pathways for these dyes were 
propose d. Immobilized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles showed similar efficacy as free 
nanoparticles.  Ag@TiO 2   was also found suitable for photocatalysis of other classes 
of dyes. Hence Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles may be considered as effective catalysts for 
the photocatalytic degradation of dyes/textile wastewater. Solar energy utilization and 
fast kinetics feature of this process makes it an economical and favorable option for 
large scale treatment of dye/textile wastewater.

 1.1 Background of research and motivation  
 
The use of synthetic chemical dyes in various industrial processes like textiles, 
printing, plastics, paper and pulp manufacturing and leather treatment has increased 
considerably, resulting in the release of dye -containing industrial effluents into the 
aquatic ecosystems and soil (Aksu 2005). Among all the industrial sectors, 
wastewater from textile industries has become one of the major environmental 
concerns, in view of both the volume rejected and the composition of effluents (Reid 
1996). Textile indust ries produce large volume of coloured dye effluents which are 
non-biodegradable and toxic (Reife and Fremann 1996).There are more than 10,000 
types of commercial dyes and the global market demand has grown over 0.7 million 
tonnes in 2004 -05 to 0.9 million tonnes in 2010 -11 (Mangal 2010). In India, the d ye 
and dyestuff production is over 0.17 million tonnes in the year 2011 -2012 and 0.086 
million tonnes upto September 2012 -13 (Department of Chemicals and 
Petrochemicals, Ministry of Chemicals and Petrochemica ls, Government of India 
2013). Textile industries alone consume dyes in excess of 107 kg/year globally and 
approximately 90 % of this total end -up on fabric (Hameed et al. 2007). 
Consequently, textile industries discharge approximately 106 kg/year of dyes into the 
waste streams.  
 Since the colour associated with dye effluent is quite noticeable to the public, 
its discharge  is an environmental concern. In the overall category of dyes, azo dyes 
constitute the most important and largest class of commercial dyes, characterized by 
the presence of an azo group ( −N=N−) (Reid 1996). Chemical structures of azo dyes 
is characterized by highly substituted aromatic rings joined by one or more azo groups 
and among them, water soluble acid and reactive dy es are the most tricky, as they 
tend to pass through conventional treatment systems unaffected (Aksu 2005). Hence 
there is a necessity for new advanced technologies for their removal from wastewater. 
It is well known that azo dyes split into corresponding aromatic amines by liver 
enzymes and intestinal flora when incorporated into the body and can cause cancer in 
human.  
 According to WHO guidelines for drinking water quality, the maximum value 
for permissible colour is 15 Units ( Binnie et al. 2002) . Regulat ory standard of colour INTRODUCTION

 for industrial wastewater specified by Central Pollution Control Board, India is 400 
Hazen  unit (C P C B 2010).  Tighter restrictions on effluent discharge and new ecolabels 
for textile products are forcing textile manufacturers to re use chemicals and process water. 
In many industrialized countries,  the introduction of ecolabels and new laws, in 
combination with international trade pressure is frightening the very survival of the 
textile industry. The textile industry quickly reacted t o these new limitations with a 
broad range of drastic alteration s and modernisms in the reuse, generation and 
treatment of textile effluent. Optimal wastewater treatment is a challenge faced by 
many textile industries throughout the world.  
Among the most commonly used techniques are adsorption (on activated 
carbon, coal, alumina, china clay, red mud, flyash, silica etc.), chemical precipitation, 
flocculation, electrocoagulation, coagulation, chemical processes (chlorination, 
ozonation) and biological metho ds (aerobic and anaerobic) (Robinson et al. 2001).  
Conventional wastewater treatment processes such as biological methods 
(aerobic and anaerobic) are commonly ineffective for the treatment of dye containing 
wastewater, due to non -biodegradable nature of th e dyes. Other commonly used 
processes such as adsorption (on activated carbon, coal, alumina, china clay, red mud, 
flyash, silica etc.), chemical precipitation, flocculation, electrocoagulation, 
coagulation, chemical processes (chlorination, ozonation) etc . have disadvantages 
such as: only a transfer of dye from one phase to another with no mineralization; 
secondary  sludge generation or high cost. To comply with today's demanding 
legislation,  easy-operated and affordable technology is needed without the fo rmation of 
sludge. These challenges have impelled intensive research in new advanced treatment 
technologies, some of which currently making their way to full -scale installations. 
Though several of these new technologies are promising in terms of performanc e and 
cost, they all serve drawbacks which need broader validation and further research . 
 Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proposed in recent years and 
among them, heterogeneous photocatalysis has been successfully employed for the 
degradation  of organic pollutants of various families due to complete mineralization 
of effluents to carbon dioxide and water (Clark and Macquarrie 2002). Heterogeneous 
photocatalysis using titanium dioxide as a catalyst has proven to be an efficient 
process for elim ination of a large number of dyes from textile wastewater INTRODUCTION  
 
 
 
5 
 (Konstantinou and Albanis 2004) . The advantage of using TiO 2 as a photocatalyst is 
that, it can be used under ambient conditions and may lead to total mineralization of 
dyes to CO 2 and H 2O (Gogate and Pandit 2004) . The mechanism of photocatalytic 
degradation of dyes involves absorption of light by TiO 2 which causes the generation 
of electrons (e-) and holes (h+). For generation of e- and h+ to occur, TiO 2 should be 
irradiated with a light source, ha ving energy greater than its band gap energy (Gupta 
et al. 2012 a,b). The photogenerated electron -hole pairs are powerful oxidizing and 
reducing agents. They either react with the dyes directly to form oxidation or 
reduction products (R+) or lead to format ion of superoxide radical anion (O.
2) or 
hydroxyl (OH.) radicals. These radicals are powerful oxidants and are reported to be 
responsible for heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of dyes.  
 However, the low quantum yields and large band gap of TiO 2 due to e- and h+ 
recombination prevent it from practical applications. The technological use of TiO 2 is 
largely impaired (Sakthivel and Kish 2003) due to these reasons. In photocatalytic 
processes various attempts have been made to reduce electron -hole recombi nation. 
Hence in recent times to increase the efficiency of AOPs, the research is focused on 
the advancement of modified semiconductor photocatalysts (Sobana et al. 2008).  
 Solar energy has the potential to provide for the future energy needs (Li et al. 
2013) and exploitation of this alternate energy resource is the prime aim of 21st 
century engineers and scientists (Bokare et al. 2013). Solar light induced 
photocatalysis has attracted extensive attention due to its agreement with green 
chemistry concept i n endorsing innovative technologies (Malato et al. 2003). Solar 
energy can be converted into chemical energy by photocatalysts which are used for 
degradation of dyes in wastewater (Sharma et al. 2012). The band gap energy of TiO 2 
being 3.2eV, it can be exc ited only by UV light. It cannot be efficiently used as a 
photocatalyst in sunlight, which consists only 4 –5% of UV irradiations (Dalrymple et 
al. 2010). Using UV irradiation for the treatment of industrial wastewater is not only 
costly but also not feasib le, as UV light in bulk can be hazardous. In countries like 
India, which receives huge amount of solar light for almost 10 months in a year 
(Singh et al. 2011a), solar photocatalysis is preferable. So, there is a need of effective 
photocatalysts which can be excited by both UV and visible light of solar irradiation. 
While comparing degradation of organic compounds under artificial UV radiation and INTRODUCTION

 by solar radiation, it has been found that the latter process demonstrates to be 
economically and technically f easible (Vineetha et al. 2013). Efforts are towards 
designing the photocatalysts which show very efficient UV and solar light induced 
photocatalytic activity, so that they find their application in continuous treatment of 
dye contaminated wastewaters, by t heir utilization as catalyst for solar light driven 
photocatalysis during day time and artificial UV light induced photocatalysis during 
night. Alternatively, wastewater generated during night may be stored and treated 
during daytime by batch photocatalysi s. 
 In the composite systems photocatalytic efficiency can be enhanced by 
deposition of noble metals such as Au, Ag, Pd and Pt on a TiO 2 surface because they 
promote interfacial charge transfer processes by acting as electron trap (Behar and 
Rabani 2006). Though this type of catalyst structure is effective, it results in exposing 
noble metal to the surrounding medium and reactants ( Subramanian et al. 2003; 
Hirakawa and Kamat 2004) . Metals may get easily corroded on the surface of the 
semiconductor.  
 An efficient way to conquer these limitations is to develop a core –shell 
structure, in which the noble metal particles are introduced as core and the 
semiconductor dioxide such as TiO 2 as shell (Tom et al. 2003; Chan and Barteau  
2005). The oxide shell is bene ficial because it is an effective way to prevent corrosion 
and agglomeration of metals under extreme conditions. Among core -shell 
nanoparticles, Ag@TiO 2 with Ag core and TiO 2 shell has wider applications due to 
photoinduced charge separation , possibility t o envisage electron storage and surface 
plasmon modulation using electron acceptor , band gap excitation and charge 
equilibration in the Fermi level  (Hirakawa and Kamat 2005). These properties are 
suitable for photocatalysis by these core -shell structures. The nanosized core shell 
structures can also provide larger specific surface area and hence can exhibit 
enhanced photocatalytic activity, which is due to the fact that the specific surface area 
of small particles is greater than larger particles (Mercuri 2007) and it  provides larger 
surface for photocatalytic reaction. The interesting properties exhibited due to an 
oxide shell on a metal nanoparticle, as reported by Hirakawa and Kamat (2004, 2005) 
is a motivation for the present research work, for the use o f Ag@TiO 2 core-shell 
structures as photocatalysts for the degradation of dyes. It was hypothesized that, with INTRODUCTION  
 
 
 
7 
 suitable modifications in the synthesis of these nanoparticles, solar photocatalytic 
activity can be imparted and UV photocatalytic activity can b e enhanced. So, it was 
proposed to synthesize Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles by one pot synthesis route of 
Hirakawa and Kamat, (2005) with suitable modifications to enhance their UV 
photocatalytic activity and to impart solar photocatalytic activity.  
 Among all the dyes, azo dyes represent upto 70 % of all the commercial dyes 
produced and among them water soluble Acid and Reactive dyes which consist of 
ionizable groups such as sulphonates ( -SO 3-), carboxylates ( -CO 2-) or sulphates ( -SO 4) 
are the most problematic dyes because of their high molecular weight and complex 
structure.  Azo dyes belonging to Acid and Reactive class have complex structure and 
their loss to the effluent during dyeing operation is high. So in the present study, two 
azo dyes namely Acid Yello w-17 (AY -17) and Reactive Blue -220 (RB -220) were 
chosen for studies on photocatalytic degradation by Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. AY -17 
is a mono azo dye of acid class which is used for coloring foods. It is widely used in 
manufacturing of leather, silk, dyeing wool, cotton, paper, and hot stamping foil and 
also being used as an additive for manufacture of house hold products such as liquid 
soap, shampoo, alcohol based perfumes, shower gel and dishwashing liquids (Lackey 
et al. 2006). Reactive Blue -220 dye is use d for colouring cotton fabric.  
 To the best of our knowledge, this is a first extensive report on the use of 
Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles as photocatalysts for photocatalytic 
degradation of azo dyes under UV light irradiation. Cheng et al. ( 2010) have shown 
the photocatalytic property of Ag@TiO 2 core shell nanocomposite nanowires in terms 
of degradation of Rhodamine –B dye under UV light irradiation. Wang et al. (2008a) 
have used Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles as catalysts for the photocatalytic degra dation of 
Alizarin red under visible light irradiation. Their study was restricted to the 
comparison of photocatalytic activity of two steps synthesized Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles with that of Degussa P25. In both the studies dyes used were not the azo 
dyes. Though there is a report by Wang et al. (2008b) on the examination of UV and 
visible photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles for 
degradation of methyl orange which is an azo dye, the study limited to the comparison 
of photocatalytic activity of two steps synthesized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles with that 
of Fe3+ doped Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. The energy consumption in the process was INTRODUCTION  
 
 
 
8 
 very high , as very high power lamps were used for irradiation in their study. The 
current work not only presents the extensive study on UV photocatalysis of azo dyes 
but also reports the solar photocatalysis using Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized by 
one pot route.  To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports till date showing the 
solar photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles.

2.1 Dyes and their classification  
 
The compounds which absorb light with wavelengths in the visible range (~350 -700 
nm) are colored. The first dye “Mauveine”, a basic dye was discovered by W.H. 
Perkin in 1856 (Reid 1996), after which numerous dyes were discovered. Dyes 
contain chromophores and auxochromes that cause or intensify the colour of the 
chromophore by altering the overall energy o f the electron system (Hunger 2003). 
Usual chromophores are -C=C -, -C=N -, -C=O, -N=N -, -NO 2, quinoidrings, and the 
auxochromes are -NH 3, -COOH, -SO 3H and –OH groups (Hunger 2003). Dyes can be 
classified according to their chemical structure or usage or met hod of application.   LITERATURE REVI EW

 2.1.1 Classification by chemical structure  
 
Dyes can be classified by chemical structure which has many advantages. It readily 
helps in identification of dyes belonging to a group, which has characterstic 
properties . Also this is the m ost widely used classification by both chemists and 
technologists, for example azo, anthraquinone, sulphur, indigoid, triphenylmethyl 
(trityl), and phthalocyanine derivatives. Among all the dyes, azo dyes constitute upto 
70 % of all the commercial dyes pro duced. After azo dyes, anthraquinone dyes are the 
second largest class (~15%), followed by triarylmethanes (~3%) and phthalocyanines 
(~2%) (Hunger 2003) . Table 2.1 shows the classification of dyes grouped according 
to their chemical structure.

2.1.2 Classification by properties for dye adhesion and application  
 
It is advantageous to consider the classification of dyes based on the properties of the 
dyes which govern the mechanism of binding on the different materials and on their  
applications  in detail due to nomenclature of the dye. This is the principal system 
adopted by the Colour Index (Anlinker 1979). The use or method of application of 
dye depends on the nature of the dye and the fiber on which it is applied. Fibers are of 
two types: synthetic and natural fibers. Table 2.2 shows the classification of dyes 
according to their properties, usage or method of application.

 In ionic and nonionic dyes, chromophores are mostly azo or anthraquinone types. The 
reductive cleavage of azo bonds leads to the formation of amines which are highly 
toxic and among azo dyes; removal of sulphonated class is very difficult due to their 
high solubility in water. Owing to the fused aromatic structure and colour retaining 
capacity for longer time, anthraquinone dyes are mainly resistant to degradation.  
 
2.1.3 Dye discharge statistics  
 
On global scale over 0.9 million tons of dyes are produced each year. Discharge of 
dyes depends upon the nature of the dye and its chemical constituents. Table 2.3 
shows the degree of fixation and percentage of dye lost to effluents. Among the azo 
dyes, water soluble acid and reactive dyes which consist of ionisab le groups such as 
sulphonates ( -SO 3-), carboxylates ( -CO 2-) or sulphates ( -SO 4-) are the most 
problematic dyes because of their high molecular weight. So in the present study, two 
azodyes namely Acid Yellow -17 and Reactive Blue -220 were chosen for studies on 
photocatalytic degradation, due to their complexity in structure and high loss to the 
effluents.

 2.1.4 Environmental problems and adverse effects  
 
The environmental issues associated with dye containing water are always a concern 
as dye concentration in water higher than 1 mg/L can be easily noticeable by public. It 
was found that high concentrations of dyes present in water can cause troubles in 
numerous ways (Pereira and Alves 2012):  
(i) Dyes can have acute and/or chronic effects on exposed organisms, depending 
on the exposure time and the dye concentration.  
(ii) Dye wastewater captures the attention of both the public and the authorities as 
the dyes are inh erently highly visible and minor release itself can cause abnormal 
coloration of surface waters.  
(iii) Dyes can have drastic effects on the growth of bacteria as dyes absorb/reflect 
sunlight entering the water which may upset their biological activity.  
(iv)  Dyes are  difficult to treat due to their complicated and different molecular 
structures and therefore, interfere with municipal waste treatment operations.  
(v) Dye effluents undergo chemical and biological changes; destroy aquatic life 
by consuming dissolved oxygen fr om the stream.  
(vi)  Dyes produce micro toxicity to fish and other organisms due to their tendency 
to sequester metal ions.  
 Due to the aromatic nature, most of the dyes are non -biodegradable, 
carcinogenic or cause allergies, dermatitis, skin irritation or dif ferent tissular changes 
(Carmen and Daniela 2012). Among various dyes, azo dyes are most dangerous as 
they try to pass conventional treatment process ineffectively and when incorporated 
into the body, it can split into corresponding aromatic amines by live r enzymes and 
intestinal flora, which can cause cancer in human (Carmen and Daniela 2012).  The 
adsorption of azo dyes and their breakdown products (toxic amines) pose high  
potential health risk to human health through the gastrointestinal tract, skin, lung s, 
and also formation of hemoglobin adducts and disturbance of blood formation 
(Carmen and Daniela 2012). Also azo dyes can damage DNA which can lead to the 
genesis of malignant tumors. The carcinogenic potential can increase with electron -
donating substit uents in ortho and para position and diminishes with the protonation 
of amine groups (Carmen and Daniela 2012).   LITERATURE REVI EW

 2.1.5 Regulations for dye containing wastewater  
 
Presence of dyes in concentration more than the certain standard limit in water bodies 
causes many adverse effects to human beings, animals, plants etc. Hence, stringent 
regulations have been imposed by various organizations. World Health Organization 
(WHO ) guidelines for drinking water quality, has set the maximum value for 
permissible colour at 15 –20 units ( Binnie et al. 2002 ). Color standard for drinking 
water specified by USEPA is 20 units (USEPA 2013). The Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB), India has prescribed the permissible colour level of 400 Hazen unit  
for the discharge of the effluent (CPCB 2010). Apart from regulatory standard for 
colour, these dyes contribute to Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Biological 
Oxygen Demand (BOD) in wastewater. Hence removal of dyes from wastewater 
before discharge into surface waters is essential to meet the regulatory standards in 
terms of colour, COD and BOD.  
 
2.2 Methods for removal of dyes from wastewater  
 
Many t Freatment processes have been applied over last two decades in order to 
remove dyes from contaminated wastewater. Among the most commonly used 
techniques are adsorption on activated carbon (Rao et al.  1994), coal (Gupta et al.  
1990), natural clay (Gupta et al. 1992), red mud (Ratnamala et al. 2012), flyash 
(Gupta et al. 1990), etc., electrocoagulation (Lopes et al. 2005), coagulation and 
precipitation ( Kartikeyan, 1990),  chemical processes such as chlorination (Namboodri 
et al. 1994 a,b) and ozonation (Xu and Lebrun 1999) and biological methods which 
include aerobic processes (Rai et al.  2005) and anaerobic processes (Delee et al. 
1998). The classical or conventional method such as adsorption are not destructive but 
only transfer  dye from one phase to another which creates other type of pollution 
(Khatee et al. 2009). Although some treatment processes, such as chemical 
coagulation, treatment with ozone and carbon adsorption, may remove certain 
categories of dye to about 90 % (Poon  and Vittimberga 1981, Lorimer et al. 2001), 
each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. The main drawback of 
chemical coagulation, precipitation and electrocoagulation is the generation of a large LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
19 
 amount of sludge or solid waste, resulting in hi gh operational costs for sludge 
treatment and disposal. Ozone treatment does not require sludge disposal but suffers 
from high cost. Many of the azo dyes are non -biodegradable and hence biological 
treatment options cannot be adopted. Even in the case of bi odegradable dyes, 
biological treatment processes are slow and ineffective at high concentrations. Table 
2.4 presents the available technologies for dye degradation with its advantages and 
disadvantages.  
 Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective meth od of wastewater treatment 
capable of removing dyes from industrial effluents. An affordable and easy -operated 
control technology without the formation of sludge is needed to comply with today's 
demanding legislation. These challenges have impelled serious  research in new 
advanced treatment technologies, some of which are presently making their way to 
full-scale installations. Several new technologies in wastewater decolorization have 
emerged with improved performance and are more environmental friendly. Am ong 
them, advanced oxidation processes (AOP’s) have been emerged as one of the 
promising technologies for the degradation of dyes due to their compliance with green 
chemistry concept. Due to the formation of highly reactive chemical species, the dye 
molecu les degrade into biodegradable compounds, which further degrade to CO 2 and 
H2O.

2.2.1 Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs)  
 
Due to the stringent environmental regulations set by governments and various 
organizations, research on water purification has been growing extensively for the last 
25 years and has resulted in an intensive search for new and more efficient wastewater 
treatment technologies. AOPs are of ample interest currently for the effective 
oxidation of a wide variety of organics and dyes (Kang and Hoffmann, 1998; Boye et 
al. 2002; Stasinakis 2008 ). It is also being exploited for the purification and 
disinfection of d rinking water (Andreozzi et al.  1999; Casero et al.1997; Benites et al. 
1995; Masten and Davies 1994; Peyton et al. 1982; Legrini et al. 1993; Miller et al. 
1988). Advanced oxidation technologies have been included by U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency ( USEPA) as one of the best available technology to meet the 
specification and standard that offer safe and ample pollution control (Bansal and Sud 
2011). AOPs involve the formation of strong oxidizing radicals such as hydroxyl 
radicals (HO.), superoxide ani on etc. (O 2-.) which further react with pollutants. These LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
26 
 highly reactive radicals have ability to oxidize almost all organic compounds to 
carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water (H 2O). Advanced oxidation processes can be divided 
into homogeneous and heterogeneous processes. Homogenous processes are further 
subdivided into two processes: photochemical and non -photochemical. Figure 2.1 
shows the classification of homogenous and heterogeneous processes. Homogenous 
processes mainly need oxidant to generate hydroxyl rad ical and hydrogen peroxide is 
most frequently used. Heterogeneous processes use solid catalysts along with oxidants 
for degradation of dyes. It has been reported in literature that heterogeneous processes 
are more efficient and in the present study heterog eneous process has been used. 
Heterogeneous photocatalysis has emerged as an important destructive technology 
leading to the total mineralization of most of the organic pollutants including organic 
reactive dyes (Schiavello 1988; Guillard et al. 2003; Gali ndo et al. 2001; Serpone and 
Pelizzetti 1989; Fox and Dulay 1993; Kusvuran et al. 2005; Khodja et al. 2001; 
Neppolian et al. 2002a; Lathasree et al. 2004). Heterogeneous photocatalysis specially 
has several advantages, no reagent is used. The only chemical  used is semiconductor 
photocatalyst such as TiO 2, SnO 2, ZrO 2, CdS and ZnO (Kansal et al. 2008; Daneshvar 
et al. 2006). Oxidants such as H 2O2 may be added to enhance the rate of degradation.

2.3 Basic principle of heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of dyes  
 
Photocatalysis in the presence of irradiated semiconducting oxides has been 
successfully used to oxidize many organic pollutants present in aqueous systems 
(Schiavello 1997; Fujishim a and Tryk 1999). With the use of TiO 2 photocatalysts, the 
past two decades have witnessed serious studies associated with light stimulated 
mineralization of hazardous organic pollutants (Crittender et al. 1997; Yamashita et 
al. 2000; Di-Paola et al. 2002 ). Particularly, it has been also used to decolorate and 
mineralizes many kinds of azo -dyes in a bench scale by using both artificial 
irradiation ( Goncalves et al. 1999; Kiriakidou et al. 1999 ) and also solar technology 
(Wang 2000). Photocatalysis usually happen with the attack of organic pollutants by 
the hydroxyl radical and super oxide radical, generated on TiO 2 catalyst surface due to 
oxidation of surface hydroxyl by TiO 2 and/or reduction of dissolved oxygen (Poulios 
and Aetopoulon 1999; Carlos et al. 2 000). A large variety of organic pollutants can be 
broken down by photocatalysis to water, CO 2 and mineral salts as the degradation 
LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
28 
 products (Byrappa et al. 2000). The photocatalysis process can break down a large 
variety of organic compounds to CO 2, water  and mineral salts, as the degradation 
products (Byrappa et al. 2000). The greatest advantage of photocatalysis over 
conventional treatment method is the complete mineralization of organic pollutants 
(Ding et al. 2000). Most of the photocatalytic studies u se either synthetic or 
commercial TiO 2 as the photocatalyst (Grzechulska and Morawski 2002; Noorjahan et 
al. 2002). The TiO 2 semiconductor due to its comparatively high efficiency and low 
cost has been reported to be the most promising photocatalyst (Wang 2000; Ding et 
al. 2000; Neppolian et al. 2002b). Titanium dioxide has been widely used as 
photocatalyst because it has strong oxidizing power and nontoxic to human life. In 
recent years lot of reviews have been published (Ahmed et al. 2011; Akpan and 
Hamee d 2009; Carmen and Daniela 2012; Gupta and Suhas 2009; Konstantinou and 
Albanis 2004) on photocatalysis with titanium dioxide.  
            The detailed mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of dyes involves 
absorption of light by the semiconductor (e.g.,  TiO 2 and ZnO) particle which causes 
the excitation of the semiconductor molecules from the valence band to the 
conduction band of the semiconductor and due to this, conduction band electrons (e-) 
and valence band holes (h+) are generated as shown in Eq.(2 .1). General mechanism 
of photocatalytic degradation by TiO 2 is represented in Figure 2.2. For excitation to 
occur, semiconductor should be irradiated with light energy greater than its band gap 
energy (Akpan and Hameed 2009; Konstantinou and Albanis 2004) . 
                                               (2.1)  
These photogenerated electron -hole pairs are powerful oxidizing and reducing agents. 
The photogenerated electrons in the conduction band either reduce dye to form R+ ,or 
react with oxygen adsor bed on the catalyst (TiO 2) surface and reducing  it to 
superoxide radical anion (O.
2) whereas the photogenerated holes in valence band 
either oxidize the dye to form R+, or react with OH– or H 2O, oxidizing them into 
hydroxyl radicals. Highly oxidant specie s such as (Hydroxyl or peroxide radicals) are 
reported to be responsible for the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of dyes. 
According to this, the relevant oxidation and reduction reactions occurring at the 
semiconductor surface (TiO 2) can be expres sed as follows:

2.4 Photocatalysts  
 
A wide variety of semiconductor photocatalysts have been employed for the 
photocatalysis of organic compounds (Daneshvar et al. 2004). Table 2.5 shows the  
band gap energy level of different semiconductors (Serpone 1995). Of all the 
photocatalysts, TiO 2 is found to be the most active catalyst for degradation of organic 
compounds. TiO 2 emerges to be a relatively economic, effectual, chemically stable 
and easi ly available (Zhao and Yang 2003; Zang et al. 1998). In the literature, 
abundant applications of this technique were cited and a number of outstanding 
reviews were published (Heglin 1989; Hegfeldt and Gratzel 1995; Fox and Dulay 
1993; Kamat 1993). TiO 2 has three crystalline phase; anatase, rutile and brookite, LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
30 
 among which anatase and rutile form are frequently studied, as brookite is not stable 
and convert to rutile ( Saepurahman et al. 2010) . Anatase form of TiO 2 is found to be 
the most active form for photocatalysis (Ovenstone and Yanagisawa 1999).

Special attention has been paid by researchers and engineers to TiO 2 nanoparticles as 
it has several advantages over bulk TiO 2: (i) It can reduce the recombination of 
photogenerated electron -hole pair. (ii) Surface area of catalyst can be increased which 
further enhance the rate of photocatalysis. (iii) It can lead to quantum size effect.  
Various authors have used commercially available TiO 2 photocatalysts such as 
Degus sa P25, PC500, TTP and UV100 for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes. P25 
has been found to be effective in most of cases because P25 consist of 75% anatase 
and 25% rutile with a specific BET -surface area of 50 m2 g-1 and primary particle size 
of 20 nm ( Bickley et al. 1991 ). Hombikat UV100 consists of 100% anatase with a 
specific BET surface area >250 m2 g-1 and primary particle size of 5 nm (Lindner et 
al. 1997). The photocatalyst PC500 has a BET -surface area of 287 m2 g-1 with 100% 
anatase and primary particle size of 5 -10 nm (Saquib et al. 2003). The commercially 
available TTP, India photocatalyst, has a BET surface area of 9.82 m2/g. Various 
authors have reported that Degussa P25 shows better photocatalytic activity  as LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
31 
 compared to other commercially available photocatalysts for the photocatalytic 
degradation of dyes (Faisal et al. 2007, Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006a, 
2004; Qamar et al.  2005 a,b) . 
 Faisal et al. (2007) tested the photocatalytic activity of three  different 
commercially available TiO 2 powders (namely Degussa P25, Hombikat UV100 and 
PC500) on the degradation kinetics of model pollutants (Acridine Orange and 
Ethidium Bromide) at different concentrations such as 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 g L-1. Degussa 
P25 was found to be more efficient for the degradation of both the dyes at all 
concentrations.  
Saquib and Muneer (2002) tested the activity of three different commercially 
available photocatalysts (Degussa P25, Hombikat UV100 and PC500) for 
photocatalytic degradat ion of an anthraquinone dye, Remazol Brilliant Blue R under 
UV light. It was observed that the degradation of dye proceeds much more rapidly in 
the presence of P25. Saquib and Muneer (2003a) checked the activity of these three 
different commercially availa ble photocatalysts on the degradation kinetics of gentian 
violet. It was observed that the mineralization and degradation of dye proceeds much 
more rapidly in the presence of P25 as compared with other photocatalysts. The order 
of decolorization efficiency  of various photocatalysts was found to be P25> PC500> 
UV100 for gentian violet. Saquib and Muneer (2003b) checked the activity of four 
different commercially available photocatalysts (Degussa P25, Hombikat UV100, 
PC500 and TTP) on the degradation kinetics  of Acid orange 8. It was observed that 
the mineralization and degradation of dye proceeds rapidly in the presence of P25 as 
compared with other photocatalysts. The order of decolorization efficiency of various 
photocatalysts was found to be P25> UV100> PC 500> TTP. Saquib et al.  (2008) have 
also found that in the degradation of two selected dye derivatives, Fast Green and 
Acid Blue 1,  the order of decolorization efficiency of various photocatalysts was 
P25>PC500>UV100. The photocatalytic activity of these three commercially 
available photocatalysts were examined on the degradation of Xylenol orange (Tariq 
et al. (2008), Amarnth and Bismark brown (Tariq et al. 2005) and it was found that 
Degussa P25 has a highest photocatalytic activity as compared to others.  
Many earlier studies have reported that Degussa P25 shows a better activity 
for the photocatalytic degradation of a large number of organic compounds (Mun eer LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
32 
 et al. 2001; Muneer et al. 1999).  Muruganandham and Swaminathan, (2006 a,b) and 
Kansal et al.  (2006) have also observed the higher efficacy of Degussa P25 as 
compared to TiO 2 anatase as a photocatalyst in both the degradation and 
decolorization of dye s. 
Qamar and Muneer (2009) explained that, the higher photocatalytic activity of 
Degussa P25 is due to its mixed phase (75% anatase and 25% rutile). Degussa P25 
composed of small nano -crystallites of rutile disperses within an anatase matrix. It is 
explain ed by Qamar and Muneer (2009) that, the excited electrons get trapped in the 
rutile phase thus inhibiting the electron –hole pair recombination (a major energy 
wasting step) which in turn increases the photocatalytic efficiency of P25. Another 
reasoning rep orted was that, the smaller band gap of rutile catches the photons, 
generating electron/hole pairs. The electron transfer, from the rutile conduction band 
(CB) to electron traps in anatase phase, takes place. Recombination is thus inhibited, 
allowing the h ole to move to the surface of the particle and react (Hurum et al. 2003).  
In certain cases, 100 % anatase TiO 2 showed better photocatalytic activity, 
than the mixture of rutile and anatase TiO 2.  
Saquib and Muneer (2002) had found that Hombikat UV100 was slightly 
better under sunlight as compared with Degussa P25 for photocatalytic degradation of 
an anthraquinone dye, Remazol Brilliant Blue. Saquib et al.  (2008) have also found 
that in the degradat ion of Fast Green, UV100 was better than P25.  Similar results 
were observed by Tariq et al.  (2008) in the degradation of Acid blue 45. The order of 
decolorization efficiency of various photocatalysts was found to be UV100 > P25 > 
PC500.  
TiO 2 as photocataly st have been used in numerous studies. However, the TiO 2 
photocatalyst has its limitations,  
i) Owing to its large band gap energy, only UV light can be used as a radiation 
source, as natural solar radiation encompasses only about 4 –5 % of UV rays 
(Heller 1995 ; Linesbigler et al. 1995).  
ii) Low quantum yields of TiO 2 due to recombination of photogenerated electron 
and hole pairs (Rothenberger et al. 1985; Tributsch et al. 1989).  
 Several attempts have been performed to improve the photocatalytic activity 
of TiO 2 such as, combination of TiO 2 with other semiconductors (Wu 2004), covering LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
33 
 of the surface with dyes in order to extend the light absorption to the visible range, 
doping metal ions into the TiO 2 lattice (Behpour et al.  2010; Sakthivel et al. 2004; 
Subba Rao et al. 2003; Hoffmann et al. 1995) and partially coating with noble and 
transition metals (Sajjad et al. 2010; Siemon et al. 2002; Liu et al. 2004). Amongst 
them, the noble metal deposition on the surface of TiO 2, such as, silver, gold, 
platinum and palladi um (Vamathevan et al.  2002) can be cited. Most of the deposited 
metals that have been previously studied belong to group VIII. A considerable 
increase of the photocatalytic activity has been reported in particular with platinum 
deposited on TiO 2 particles (Hufschmidt and Bahnemann 2002; Klare et al. 2000). 
The photocatalytic activity with silver deposit was much less enhanced than that with 
Pt deposit. Nevertheless, silver is most suitable for industrial applications due to its 
lower cost and eas y preparation (Vamathevan et al. 2002). In photocatalytic 
oxidations, the reaction rate is controlled by charge transfer to O 2 (Sclafani and 
Herrmann 1998) and silver has special behavior for oxygen adsorption. Kondo and 
Jardim (1991) have shown that the A g-loaded TiO 2 was more effective than the pure 
TiO 2 in the degradation of chloroform and urea. Also, Sahoo et al. (2006)  found that 
Ag+ doped TiO 2 is slightly more efficient than the undoped TiO 2 in the photocatalytic 
degradation of C.I. Basic Violet 3.  It was reported by Behnajady et al.  (2008)  that, 
silver doped TiO 2 is more efficient than undoped TiO 2 in photocatalytic degradation 
of Acid Red -88. Rupa et al.  (2007) investigated the photocatalytic degradation of 
Reactive Yellow 17 using Ag doped TiO 2 nano particles and found enhancement in 
photocatalytic activity under both UV and visible light irradiations for Ag doped TiO 2 
nanoparticles. The increase in efficacy of Ag doped TiO 2 as compared to bare TiO 2 is 
owing to the accumulation of electrons, small siz e of Ag nanoparticles on TiO 2 
surface and better charge separation which reduces the recombination of electron and 
hole pairs.  
Thus it is well -known that noble metal nanoparticles (e.g. Ag and Au) can tune 
the catalytic properties of metal oxides such as TiO 2 (Hirakawa and Kamat 2005).The 
combination of two nanomaterials (Ag and TiO 2) may be properly designed to yield 
improved catalytic and optical properties.  
          In recent years, several research groups have synthesized metal core and TiO 2 
shell (me tal@TiO 2) (Hirakawa and Kamat 2005) and TiO 2 core and metal shell LITERATURE REVI EW

 (TiO 2@metal)  (Vıctor et al. 2008; Zhang et al.  2003; Mirkhani et al.  2009; Rupa et al. 
2007 ) nanocomposites. The presence of co catalytic noble metal deposits on metal 
oxide particles is often employed to enhance the photocatalytic oxidation efficiency of 
processes through achievement of a more efficient charge separation (Hidaka et al.  
2007). Ag -TiO 2 modified photocatalysts and their potential applications with 
enhanced photocatalytic efficacy have been reported. The core -shell structures have 
the ability to store photogenerated electrons which make them suitable for light 
energy conversion and s torage. Although noble metals such as gold and silver are 
poor catalysts in bulk form, nano -sized counterparts with a passivating shell show 
excellent catalytic activity as a result of the high surface area and interface dominated 
properties (Zhang et al.  2006). In most of the catalytic studies, metal particles are 
usually deposited on the oxide surface (Dawson and Kamat 2001; Ohko et al. 2001). 
The presence of Ag deposits on TiO 2 surface can help to efficiently separate the 
electron -hole pairs by attractin g the conduction band photoelectrons. This process has 
been shown to improve the overall efficiency for a number of photocatalytic reactions 
(Tran et al.  2006).The deposited metal, on the one hand, can suppress the electron -
hole recombination, beneficial t o the photocatalytic oxidation (Sclafani and Herrmann 
1998; Fox 1992). However, corrosion or dissolution of the metal nanoparticles after 
their extended exposure to reactants and the surrounding medium may pose a concern 
for their photocatalytic activities  (Subramanian et al. 2001, 2003; Lahiri et al. 
2003).The oxide shell is important because it is an effective way to prevent metal 
nanoparticles from agglomerating under extreme conditions, whereas uncoated 
particles coagulate easily resulting from the Van der Waals’ force (Zhang et al. 2006). 
To address this problem, a composite structure of metal nanoparticle core and oxide 
shell is considered a better design, because the oxide shell can protect the metal core 
and stabilize it against chemical attack.  
              Hirakawa and Kamat (2005) found that, photoexcitation of TiO 2 shell results 
in accumulation of the electrons in the Ag core in Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticle. Their 
results showed that the stored electrons are discharged when an electron acceptor such 
as O2 is introduced into the system. Charge equilibration with redox couple showed 
the ability of these core shell structures to carry out photocatalytic reduction reactions. 
With electron acceptor it is also possible to envisage surface plasmon modulation an d LITERATURE REVI EW

 electron storage in Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles (Hirakawa and Kamat 2004). Cheng et al.  
(2010) have shown the photocatalytic property of Ag@TiO 2 core-shell nanocomposite 
nanowires in terms of degradation of Rhodamine – B dye under UV light irradiation. 
Their r esults confirmed that Ag@TiO 2 core-shell nanowires exhibited excellent 
photocatalytic activity as compared to Degussa P25 and TiO 2. Wang et al.  (2008a) 
have used Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles as catalysts for the photocatalytic degradation of 
Alizarin red under visible light irradiation. The study was restricted to the comparison 
of photocatalytic activity of two steps synthesized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles with that 
of Degussa P25. I n both the studies, dyes used were not the azo dyes. Though there is 
a report by Wang et al.  (2008b) on the examination of UV and visible photocatalytic 
activity of Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles for degradation of methyl 
orange which is an az o dye, the study limited to the comparison of photocatalytic 
activity of two steps synthesized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles with that of Fe3+ doped 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. The energy consumption in the process was very high, as 
very high power lamps were used for irradiation. The interface between Ag and TiO 2 
can attract light -induced electrons from the semiconductor TiO 2 to reduce electron –
hole recombination . Since it is reported in literature that Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles have 
unique properties of interfacial charge transfer and high visible light absorption , it 
was proposed to study the efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles for the UV and solar 
photocatalysis of azo dyes.  
To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports till date showing the solar 
photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles.  
 
2.4.1 Preparation of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticl es 
 
Many people have reported on the synthesis of metal@TiO 2 nanoparticles or 
composites (Hirakawa and Kamat 2005; Dawson and Kamat 2001; Hyun -Woo et al. 
2007; Du et al.  2006; Young et al.  2004; Zhang et al.  2005). The combination Ag and 
TiO 2 nanomaterials  may be suitably designed by proper synthesis method and 
conditions, to yield enhanced optical and catalytic properties that utilize the 
characteristics of photoexcitation of the electron from the TiO 2 shell to the metal core 
(Hirakawa and Kamat 2005).  LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
36 
 There are two reported methods for the preparation of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. They 
are one pot synthesis method and two step synthesis method.  
 
(i) One pot synthesis  
 
Pastoriza -Santos et al.  (2000) have tried to synthesize the Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles by 
high temperature reduction of Ag by dimethyl formamide (DMF)/ethanol mixture in 
the presence of titanium tetraoxybutyl and acetylacetone. Similar nanoparticles were 
synthesized by refluxing a mixture of silver and TiO 2 colloids (from Ti ( IV) butoxide) 
at 90°C (Kim et al. 2004). Tom et al.  (2003) synthesized nanostructures by reduction 
of silver nitrate with DMF and titanium isopropoxide was used as the shell -forming 
reagent on silver nanoparticles n. The colloidal material was precipitated  by the 
addition of toluene. Du et al.  (2006) prepared Ag@TiO 2 nanostructures by one pot 
synthesis. In this method, tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) was added dropwise to ethylene 
glycol (EG) containing the desired amount of AgNO 3. Solution was loaded into a 20 
mL stainless steel cell and maintained at 240 °C or 270 °C for 14 h. Zhang et al.  
(2006) and Dang et al.  (2010) synthesized Ag@TiO 2 by a simple one -pot chemical 
reaction procedure using dimethyl formamide reduction of AgNO 3 and titanium 
isopropoxide with he ating and stirring for 90 min. Hirakawa and Kamat (2005) also 
used the same one pot synthesis using dimethyl formamide reduction of AgNO 3 and 
titanium tetra ethanolaminato isopropoxide (TTEAIP) with heating at 85 °C and 
continuous refluxing, stirring for 9 0 min.  
 
(ii) Two step synthesis  
 
 Zeena et al.  (2004) synthesized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles by two step method. 
First, the formation of silver core takes place by the reduction of trisodium citrate and 
then formation of TiO 2 shell take place by heating and ref luxing at 60 °C. Zhang et al.  
(2005) prepared Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles by two step method. First the formation of 
the silver core takes place by the reduction of Tollen’s reagent with glucose in the 
water phase of the water -in-oil emulsions, and the hydrolysis of Titanium ortho 
butoxide (TOB) at the water/oil i nterface for the formation of the amorphous TiO 2 LITERATURE REVI EW

 shell. Wang et al.  (2008a) synthesized Ag@TiO 2 core–shell nanoparticles using silver 
acetate, dodecylamine, oleic acid and titanium tetraisopropoxide. First, silver acetate 
was dissolved in dodecylamine and then oleic acid was added. After this titanium tetra 
isopropoxide was slowly added and stirring was continued for 15 min. Finally, the 
solution was transferred into autoclave. The autoclave was first kept at 120 ºC for 5 h, 
then increased to 150 ºC and kep t for another 47 h. To precipitate the nanoparticles, 
isopropanol was added. Wang et al.  (2008b) made Ag@TiO 2 core–shell nanoparticles 
by two step method, wherein , the formation of silver core takes place by reduction of 
hydrazine with cetyl trimethyl ammo nium bromide (CTAB) followed by addition of 
titanium tetra isopropoxide (TTIP) to the Ag solution under vigorous stirring for 
10min at ambient temperature, which forms a TiO 2 shell.  To obtain uniform core –
shell structures of Ag@TiO 2, Vaidya et al.  (2010) developed a two step based reverse -
micelle tactic using titanium hydroxyacylate as the shell forming agent.  Abdulla -Al-
Mamun et al.  (2011) prepared the Ag@TiO 2 core–shell nanoparticles by two step 
citrate reduction method. Ag@TiO 2 was prepared by adding AgNO 3 and titanium 
tetraethanolaminato isopropoxide (TTEAIP) with heating at 60 °C and continuous 
refluxing and stirring for 90 min. Solution was then purged with N 2 gas and irradiated 
with ultraviolet light (15 mW/cm2) to reduce an y unreacted Ag+ in solution to Ag0. 
Angkaew and Limsuwan  (2012) prepared Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles by reduction 
method using hydrazine as reducing agent and CTAB as a stabilizer. First, Ag 
nanoparticles were prepared by adding hydrazine to CTAB solution and fo llowed by 
addition of silver nitrate dropwise to hydrazine and CTAB solution. After this various 
TTIP concentration were added to Ag nanoparticles.  
     One pot synthesis is less time consuming and reported to produce better core 
shell structures than two  step synthesis routes. So in the present study, it was proposed 
to use the one pot synthesis route followed by Hirakawa and Kamat (2005) for the 
synthesis of Ag@TiO 2 photocatalyst. It was proposed to modify the synthesis 
procedure suitably to get enhanced  photocatalytic activity.  
          To test the efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 photocatalyst, its photocatalytic activity need 
to be compared with other common photocatalysts such as commercial TiO 2, 
synthesized TiO 2 and Ag doped TiO 2 photocatalysts under both UV and  solar light LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
38 
 irradiation conditions. So a review of literature on synthesis of TiO 2 and Ag doped 
TiO 2 nanocatalysts was carried out and is presented in the following section.  
 
2.4.2 Synthesis of TiO 2 and Ag doped TiO 2 nanocatalysts  
 
2.4.2.1 Synthesis of TiO 2 
 
There are many methods available for the synthesis of TiO 2 nanoparticles. The 
synthesis of TiO 2 can be classified as solution phase and gas phase techniques. 
Solution phase synthesis is the most preferred technique for the preparation of TiO 2 in 
the form of powders and thin films. Some of the solution phase techniques are 
precipitation method ( Jing et al. 2009 ), hydrothermal synthesis ( Jeong et al. 2008 ), 
sol-gel method (Rupa et al.  2009), combustion synthesis ( Nagaveni et al.  2004 ), 
electrochemical synthesis (Kumar et al. 2008) and sonochemical synthesis ( Arami et 
al. 2007 ). Gas phase technique is widely employed for the synthesis of thin film 
samples. Some of the gas phase techniques include chemical vapor deposition (CVD) 
(Mills et al.  2002 ) and spray pyrolysis deposition ( Okuya et al. 2002 ). In all the above 
methods combustion synthesis has been reported to yield TiO 2, which have 100% 
anatase without any rutile impurity ( Sivalingam et al. 2003). It is because, during 
combustion, the temperature reaches about 650 ◦C for a short period of time (1 -2 
minutes) making the material crystalline (Nagaveni et al. 2004). Since the time is too 
short, particle growth of TiO 2 and phase transition to rutile is hindered. This technique 
involves t he combustion of a stoichiomeric mixture of titanyl nitrate with the fuel, 
glycine at 350 ◦C in a muffle furnace. Titanyl nitrate is synthesized by the hydrolysis 
and subsequent nitration of the precursor compound, titanium tetra -isopropoxide. The 
stoichio meric reaction can be represented as (Addamo et al. 2004) shown in Eq.(2.9).  
                                                     (2.9)  
The above reaction indicates that 9 moles of titanyl nitrate reacts with 10 moles of 
glycine to yield 9  moles of TiO 2 and nearly 60 moles of gaseous products. The 
evolution of such high amounts of gases results in high porosity and hence, high 
surface area of TiO 2. Moreover, low overall temperature results in the formation of 
anatase phase TiO 2. In the pres ent study, TiO 2 nanoparticles were prepared by LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
39 
 different methods and photocatalytic activity of as synthesized TiO 2 nanoparticles was 
compared with Ag@TiO 2 photocatalyst.  
 
2.4.2.2 Preparation of Ag doped TiO 2 
 
Catalyst modification by doping with metal or transition metal ion is an approach to 
enhance the photocatalytic activity. Since 1980s, catalyst has been modified mainly 
by metal loading to achieve a better photocatalytic activity (Morikawa et al.  2004). 
Besides, a successful doping by transition metal ion also showed improvement in the 
photocatalytic system (Davydov et al. 2003). There are many methods available for 
the preparation of doped TiO 2 which includes sol gel (Rupa et al. 2009; Zhang et al.  
2008) , hydrothermal (Jeong et al. 2008 ), liquid impregnation (Sahoo et al.  2005, 
Behnajady et al. 2008 ) and photodeposition (Behnajady et al. 2008 ).So in the present 
study, Ag doped TiO 2 nanoparticles were prepared by different methods and 
photocatalytic activi ty of as synthesized Ag doped TiO 2 nanoparticles was compared 
with Ag@TiO 2 photocatalyst.  
 
2.5 Characterization of nanoparticles  
 
In nanotechnology, materials show unique properties as compared to bulk 
counterparts when size are reduced to nano level. To understand the potential 
application of nanoparticles, a deeper knowledge of properties and characteristics is 
needed. For engineered nanoparticles to be useful in photocatalysis applications, it is 
very important to characterize them. Careful investigatio n of characterization is 
crucial in order to find the properties of the engineered nanoparticles.  
 For nanoparticle characterization, large number of techniques can be 
employed and common techniques are Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), 
Scanning Ele ctron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Energy 
dispersive Analysis (EDS), X -ray diffraction (XRD), Diffuse Reflectance 
Spectroscopy (DRS), Thermal properties and surface area analysis (Tiede et al. 2008). 
Structural characterization of nanop articles is usually done with TEM (Pradeep 2010), 
AFM (Dror 1994) , and XRD (Pradeep 2010) to determine the morphology (structure LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
40 
 and shape), size and crystallinity of engineered nanoparticles. For optical 
characterization of powder samples, DRS (Reddy et al. 2002)  is usually preferred. 
Band gap energy can be determined using DRS (Murphy 2007). Thermo gravimetric -
differential thermal analysis ( TG-DTA) can be used to study thermal stability of 
materials at different temperature, construction of phase diagram  and phase transition 
(Skoog et al. 2005). Surface area evaluation is very important in photocatalysis and 
BET surface area analysis method is used to find specific surface area of 
nanoparticles.  
 
2.6 Factors affecting the photocatalytic degradation of dye s  
 
Photocatalytic degradation of dyes depends upon the intrinsic and extrinsic 
(operational) factors. Intrinsic factors include the type and composition of catalyst 
used, calcination temperature and time.  
 Extrinsic (operational) factors include pH, catal yst loading, concentration, 
oxidant, light intensity and presence of interfering substances. Both these parameters 
affect the degradation of dyes and hence affect the efficiency. So understanding the 
effect of all these operational parameters on the photoc atalytic efficiency is important 
from the operational and design point of view when selecting sustainable and efficient 
method for treatment of dyes.  
 
2.6.1 Effects of intrinsic parameters on the photocatalytic degradation of dyes  
 
2.6.1.1  Effect of catalyst compo sition  
 
Photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 is dependent on the catalyst composition. Catalyst 
compositions play an important role in the photocatalytic degradation of dyes. In case 
of doping, dopant concentrations play an important role in the photocatalytic 
degradation. Behnajady et al.  (2008) prepared silver doped TiO 2 nanoparticles by 
liquid impregnation and photo deposition methods with different amounts of silver 
(0.5-2.5% mole ratio) deposited on TiO 2 surface for determining optimum metal 
loading and als o to compare the activity of the silver doped TiO 2 prepared with LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
41 
 different methods for the photocatalytic degradation of Acid Red 88. He found that 
rate of degradation increased with an increase in the silver loading up to optimum 
loading of 2 % in Liquid impregnation and 0.5 % in photodeposition beyond which 
the rate decreased, which was due to, (i) the formation of number of photogenerated e- 
and h+ pairs reduce due to the limitation of amount of light reaching the catalyst 
surface with too much coverage of TiO 2 and consequently reduce the photocatalytic 
efficacy of TiO 2 (Carp et al.  2004). (ii) the active sites for the desired photocatalysis 
on the TiO 2 surface may be occupied by metal deposits which results in decrease in 
photocatalytic activity (Coleman et al.  2005). (iii) high Ag loadings results in 
recombination, as negatively charged Ag start attracting holes and consequently holes 
recombine with el ectrons (Carp et al.  2004). (iv) with excessive concentration of Ag, 
the possibility of the hole capture increases as a result possibility of holes reacting 
with adsorbed species at the TiO 2 surface reduces (Sobana et al.  2006).  
 Liu et al.  (2003) studied  the effect of silver content (0 -0.46 atomic %) on 
doping of TiO 2 for the photocatalysis of Methyl Orange and found that 0.05 atomic % 
Ag doped TiO 2 exhibited the highest rate of degradation, while further increase in Ag 
content decreased the rate of degra dation. Sobana et al.  (2006) investigated the effect 
of (0 -2 atomic %) in Ag doped TiO 2 on photocatalytic degradation of Direct Red 23 
and found that 1.5 % of Ag was optimum to achieve the highest photocatalytic 
efficiency.  
 In case of core -shell structure s, by varying the ratio of core diameter and shell 
thickness, large shift in the optical emission and absorption has been reported (Chen 
et al. 2004). Rayford et al.  (2005) studied the optical properties of gold nanospheres  
and observed when the shell thic kness of a core/shell particle is decreased; the 
plasmon resonance shifts to longer wavelengths (red) and become more intense. 
Increasing the ratio of core radius to total radius causes the peak to shift towards red. 
Thinning the shell layer produces a lar ge increase in polarization at the sphere 
boundary, which yields the more intense extinction peaks. The same general trends 
are observed when the nanoparticle size was increased. Catalyst composition helps in 
the formation of uniform core -shell structures (Vaidya et al. 2010). To obtain uniform  
core-shell structures, Vaidya et al.  (2010) synthesized Ag@TiO 2 core–shell structures 
utilizing two step  method, by varying shell thickness and controlling the size of the LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
42 
 core by changing [H 2O] to [surfactant] rati o and found Ag:Ti::1:0.67 ratio optimum 
for uniform core –shell nanostructures. Dang et al.  (2010) studied the effect of shell -
layer thickness on dielectric properties in Ag@TiO 2 core-shell nanoparticles filled 
with ferroelectric poly (vinylidene fluoride) composites (PVDF) and discovered that 
the shell -layer thickness of the Ag@TiO 2 core-shell nanoparticles had a crucial effect 
on the dielectric properties of Ag@TiO 2/PVDF nanocomposites. The variation of 
dielectric properties of the nanocomposites with temp erature also depended on the 
shell -layer thickness of Ag@TiO 2 core-shell nanoparticles. Angkaew and Limsuwan  
(2012) studied the effect of Ti to Ag molar ratio on preparation of two step 
synthesized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. They reported that at low concentration of 
titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) precursor salt for Ti,  TiO 2 can be effectively 
formulated on Ag nanoparticles which lead to the formation of core -shell structure but 
higher concentration lead to formation of core -shell particles w ith larger shell 
thickness. However, in their studies, too high concentration of TTIP lead to the 
composite structure with Ag nanoparticles embedded in TiO 2 matrix. According to 
them, the effect of Ag -Ti mole ratio on the morphology of nanoparticles can be  
explained in terms of the available nucleation sites and growth of titania particles on 
the pre -existing surface of silver nanoparticles. Since it was found that catalyst 
composition has a profound effect on the optical, photocatalytic properties and in 
controlling the morphology of photocatalyst ,  it was proposed to vary the 
concentration of TTEAIP and AgNO 3 in the synthesis mixture for opti mization of Ag 
to Ti molar ratio to facilitate the formation of Ag core and TiO 2 shell and to achieve 
high photocatalytic activity.  
 
2.6.1.2 Effect of calcination temperature and time  
 
Calcination temperature is important in shaping and in improving the activity of 
catalyst. It affects the catalytic efficiency of photocatalyst. Decolorization and 
degradation of pollutants increase if the calcination temperature of catalyst increased. 
It is well known from the literature that calcination temperature is an important factor 
that perhaps influences the crystallinity, morphology, and surface area of catalyst 
nanoparticles. Photocatalytic activity can be affected by calcination temperature LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
43 
 (Sathish et al. 2007; Li et al. 2005).  Enhancing calcination temperature improves the 
crystallization of TiO 2 (Wang et al. 2005; Kominami et al. 2003) which helps in the 
improvement of photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 (Yu et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2005; 
Ovenstone 2001; Kominami et al. 2003). A better crystallization means, decrease of 
crystal defects, which are the recombination centers of photo -induced charge carries 
(Yu et al. 2007 a,b; Yu et al. 2005; Mrowetz et al. 2 004; Jung et al. 2005; Liqang et 
al. 2006). Phase transformation of TiO 2 depends on the calcination temperature and 
catalyst composition (Zhang and Reller 2002). Jian-Hua and Hai -Jun (2009) noticed 
the effect of calcination temperature (300 -500 ˚C) on the photocatalytic degradation 
of Congo Red dye using TiO 2 coated on coal cinder. They found that, as the 
calcination temperature increased, degradation increased but further increase in the 
calcination temperature decreased the photocatalytic efficiency. They  reported that it 
was due to the increase in content of anatase in TiO 2 arrays, with increasing heat 
treatment temperature. According to Tao et al. (2005), near 500 °C the rutile phase 
emerges, and the content of rutile increases as the temperature increas es. It is widely 
accepted that the anatase phase of titania is a relatively ideal photocatalytic material 
among its three crystalline phases (Ovenstone and Yanagisawa 1999). In addition, the 
anatase with a small fraction of rutile shows enhanced photocatal ytic activity 
compared to the pure anatase due to the electron and hole transfer between the two 
phases (Ozawa et al. 2005). Bickley et al. (1991) presented that the mixed crystal has 
higher catalytic activity compared to the pure anatase and rutile. So, c atalyst calcined 
at 500 °C showed better photocatalytic efficiency. They reasoned it as, the mixed 
crystal facilitating the separation and preventing the recombination of holes with 
electrons. Saepurahman et al. (2010) studied the effect of calcination tem perature 
(450-850 ºC) on the photocatalytic degradation of Methyl Orange, Methyl Violet and 
Methylene Blue  dye using tungsten loaded TiO 2 and compared with unmodified TiO 2. 
With increasing temperatures, the anatase fraction of unmodified TiO 2 was decreasin g 
rapidly from 650 ºC onwards. In unmodified TiO 2 with increase in calcination 
temperature from 450 -650 ºC the ratio of anatase fraction reduced from 0.82 to 0.06 
which confirmed that anatase to rutile phase transformation took place at around 500 –
650 ºC. Their results were comparable to the earlier reported range for phase 
transformation from anatase to rutile at 500 –600 ºC ( Fernandes -Machado and Santana LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
44 
 2005). Above 550 ºC calcination temperature, the photocatalytic activity decreased 
and further increase  in temperature to 650 ºC or higher resulted in more reduction 
with unmodified TiO 2. Anatase phase of TiO 2 was detected with 1 mol % of tungsten 
loaded TiO 2 at calcination temperature of 750 ºC, but above this temperature no 
anatase phase was observed due to transformation process. High photocatalytic 
activity was observed with 1 mol % of WO 3 at calcination temperature of 550 ºC and 
only slight decrease occurred at 650 ºC but above this temperature significant 
reduction was seen with calcination temperature  of 750 and 850 ºC. With 6.5 mol % 
of WO 3, major anatase phase was observed at calcination temperature as high as 850 
ºC, which may be due to increase in tungsten loading stabilize the transformation 
process of conversion of anatase phase into rutile (Saep urahman et al. 2010). Huang 
et al. (2008) investigated the effect of calcination temperature on the UV 
photocatalytic degradation of Methyl Orange dye using Pt doped TiO 2 and found with 
increase in calcination temperature from 110 °C to 500 °C, the rate of  decolourization 
decrease from around 73 to 31 %. With 1.5 % Pt loading, rate of decolorization 
decreases from around 88 to 43 % with increase in temperature from 110 °C to 500 
°C. Authores explained that this phenomenon was due to conversion of anatase ph ase 
of TiO 2 and accumulation of catalyst particles which decreased the specific surface 
areas of catalyst, resulting in the reduction of photocatalytic activity. Ubonchonlakat 
et al. (2008) examined the effect of calcination temperature (400 -600 ºC) on the  
degradation of Methylene blue dye using Ag doped TiO 2 coated on tile substrate. In 
the presence of Ag doped TiO 2 optimum calcination temperature was 500 °C for the 
degradation of Methylene blue. Behnajady et al. (2008) studied the effect of 
calcination te mperature (500 -900 ˚C) on the degradation of Acid red 88 dye using Ag 
doped TiO 2 catalyst. They found that the rate constant decreases with increase in the 
calcination temperature. They also attributed this behavior to the transformation of 
anatase to the rutile phase, which has a little photocatalytic activity. Mozia (2008) 
examined the effect of calcination temperature (600 -800 ºC) on the degradation of 
mono and poly azo dyes using TiO 2 catalyst. The high rate of degradation of dyes 
were observed with catalyst calcined at 700 ºC for 1 h and rate of degradation 
decreased when calcined at 700 ºC for 2 to 4 h. With catalyst calcined at 700 ºC 
lowest rate of degradation was observed. They ex plained that, increase in calcination LITERATURE REVI EW

 temperature results in increase in crystallite size of anatase phase and decrease in 
specific surface area; but further increase in temperature results in phase 
transformation from anatase to rutile followed by a consi derable decrease of the 
specific surface area (Mozia 2008). The rate of photocatalysis depends upon the 
anatase content and crystallite size. The photocatalyst calcined at 700 ºC for 1 h, 
consisted 97 % of anatase content with crystallite size of 27 nm and  samples calcined 
at 700 °C for 2 to 4 h consisted 94 % of anatase with crystallites of 28 – 30 nm 
(Mozia 2008). Photocatalytic activity was found to be higher with the catalyst 
containing higher anatase content and lower crystallite size. The photocatalys t 
calcined at 800 °C showed lowest rate due to the presence of rutile phase. Yang et al. 
(2008) tested the effect of calcination temperature (573 -873 K) on the photocatalytic 
degradation of Rhodamine B and methyl ter -butyl ether using Silver and Indium 
Oxide codoped TiO 2 nanocomposites. According to their studies, t he UV - 
photocatalytic activity was enhanced as the calcination temperature increased from 
573 to 723 K. Further increasing the temperature to 873 K resulted in the decreased 
activity. Periyat et al. (2009) investigated the effect of calcination temperature (700 -
900 °C) on the UV and visible light  induced photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine 
6G using N and S codoped TiO 2. All the samples calcined at different temperatures 
showed significantly hi gher photocatalytic efficiency compared to the control titania 
prepared under identical condition. The photocatalytic activities of these codoped 
samples were also compared with that of the Degussa P25 photocatalyst. The highest 
photocatalytic activity was  obtained for sample calcined at 850 °C. This sample 
showed higher photocatalytic activity than the Degussa P25 sample, both under 
UV/visible and visible light. Wang et al. (2008c) examined the effect of calcination 
temperature (400 -900 °C) on the visible light driven photocatalytic degradation of 
indigo carmine using Bi and S codoped TiO 2. They observed a decrease in catalytic 
activity with increase in calcination temperature. They have reported that, the trend 
was because of higher calcination temperature , which gave rise to blue -shifted 
absorption and the reduced oxygen vacancies caused by higher crystallinity. 
Consequently, the photocatalytic activity declined because of the limited utilization of 
visible light. Wang et al. (2008d) tested effect of calci nation temperature on the 
photocatalytic degradation of Basic Violet 10 using TiO 2 catalysts supported by Y LITERATURE REVI EW

 Zeolite under UV light. It was found that photodegradation efficiency increased with 
increasing calcination temperature and optimum temperature was found to be 600 °C. 
According to these authors, the sharp decrease in photocatalytic degradation rate for 
the catalyst treated at 700 °C may have two causes: one is overgrowth of the TiO 2 
crystallite size and the other the existence of a rutile phase in th e TiO 2 crystal. You et 
al. (2005) investigated the effect of calcination temperature (573 -973 K) on the 
photocatalytic degradation of Methyl Orange using TiO 2 as catalyst. The 
photocatalytic activity increased as the calcination temperature was increased f rom 
573 K to 673 K and reached a maximum at a calcination temperature of 673 K, but 
further increase in calcination temperature then decreased the photocatalytic activity 
significantly. The low activity shown at 573 K was reported to be due to low 
crystall inity, though it had a smaller particle size. On the other hand, above 673 K, 
lower photocatalytic activity is due to the phase transformation of TiO 2 and increased 
crystallite size. Thus calcination temperature of 673 K was found to be optimum.  
            Calcination time affects the catalytic efficiency of photocatalyst. Hua et al. 
(2009) found the effect of calcination time (3 -7 h) on the photocatalytic degradation 
of Methyl Orange dye by cobalt doped titania. He found that as the calcination time 
incre ased, the photocatalytic activity was higher. However, the optimum time was 5 h 
by considering energy resource. Mozia (2008) investigated the effect of calcination 
time (1 -4 h) on the degradation of mono and poly azo dyes using TiO 2 catalyst. The 
anatase c rystallite size slightly increased with increase in the calcination time and 
ranged from 19 to 21 nm. As per their studies, as calcination time increases anatase to 
rutile ratio increases and degradation decreases. Optimum time was found to be 1 h. 
Wang et  al. (2010) studied the effect of calcination time on photocatalytic activity of 
an Er3+:YAlO 3/ZnO –TiO 2composite for the degradation of Acid Red B after 30.0 min 
solar light irradiation. Along with the increase of heat -treatment time at 500 ºC, 
descending adsorption ratio was observed and the degradation ratio was ascending. 
This shows that the crystallization grade of ZnO –TiO 2 composite and integration 
between Er3+:YAlO 3 and ZnO –TiO 2 is intensified with the increase of heat -treatment 
time. You et al.  (2005 ) studied the effect of calcination time (1 -10 h) on the 
photocatalytic degradation of Methyl Orange using TiO 2 as catalyst. It was found as 
calcination time increased the photocatalytic activity increased and reaches a LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
47 
 maximum at 2 h, but further increase  in time decreased the photocatalytic activity. It 
may be due to the high crystallinity of TiO 2 at 2 h but with increase in time crystallite 
size increases there by reducing surface area. Therefore 2 h was found to be optimum 
time for the photocatalytic ac tivity. Since it was found that calcination temperature 
and time has a profound effect on the crystallinity and phase conversion, it was 
proposed to carry out the catalyst optimization in the currently reported study to 
enhance photocatalytic efficacy, by varying the calcination temperature and time.  
 
2.6.2 Effect of extrinsic (operational) factors  
 
Rate of photocatalysis of dyes and hence the photocatalysis process efficiency is 
influenced by various factors such as pH, catalyst loading, concentration of dyes, 
types of oxidants and their concentration and light intensity.  
 
2.6.2.1 Effect of pH  
 
pH can play an important role in photocatalysis because rate of degradation of dyes 
can be enhanced by increasing or decreasing pH of the reaction mixture. This is  due to 
the fact that pH influences the adsorption of dye molecules on the TiO 2 surface, which 
is an important step in photodegradation (Neppolian et al. 2002b; Akpan and Hameed 
2009). The point of zero charge (pzc) of the TiO 2 is 6.8 (Muruganandham and 
Swaminathan 2004). Due to the amphoteric nature of TiO 2, its surface remains 
positively charged in acidic medium (pH<6.8) and negatively charged in alkaline 
medium (pH>6.8), as shown in the following equations (Muruganandham and 
Swaminathan 2004).  
                                   (2.10)  
                                       (2.11)  
 The pH change also effects the formation of the hydroxyl radicals by the 
reaction between hydroxide ions and positive holes. At low pH, the positiv e holes act 
as the predominant oxidation species whereas at neutral or high pH levels hydroxyl 
radicals act as the major species (Sakthivel et al. 2003). Hydroxyl radicals are easily 
generated in alkaline pH by oxidizing more hydroxyl ions available on TiO 2 surface, LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
48 
 thus the efficiency of the process is logically enhanced (Galindo et al. 2000). Similar 
results have been shown in the photocatalysed degradation of acidic azo dyes and 
triazine containing azo dyes (Neppolian et al. 2002a) although it should be noted that 
in alkaline pH there is columbic repulsion between the negative charged surface of 
photocatalyst and the hydroxide anions. This would prevent the generation of 
hydroxyl radicals and thus decrease the photodegradation. Very high pH has been 
found  favorable even when anionic azo dyes should hamper adsorption on the 
negatively charged surface (Mills et al. 1993). Reduction by electrons in conduction 
band may play a very important role in the dye degradation at low pH due to the 
reductive cleavage of  azo bonds. The surface area available for dye adsorption and 
photon absorption would be reduced due to agglomeration of TiO 2 particles under 
acidic pH (Bahnemann et al. 1994). Rupa et al.  (2007) tested the effect of pH in the 
range of 2 -13; on the photoca talytic degradation of Reactive Yellow -17 using Ag 
doped TiO 2 under UV and visible light and found that degradation of dye increased up 
to neutral pH and decreased thereafter for both visible and UV light. pH of 7 and 8 
was found to be optimum owing to max imum degradation of dye under UV and 
visible light,  respectively. At highly acidic conditions decrease in degradation was 
attributed to the dissolution of TiO 2. However, they found that above pH 9 reduction 
in degradation efficacy is due to columbic repuls ion between the negatively charged 
dye surface and the hydroxyl anions. Sohrabi et al.  (2009)  tested the effect of pH in 
the range of 2 -11, on the photocatalytic degradation of Benzidien Yellow. 100 % 
degradation after 60 min was obtained at pH of 2. It was explained that if carbonyl 
groups of the dye have negative and positive charged groups in its structure, the acidic 
solution favours adsorption of dye onto the photocatalyst surface. Maximum 
degradation was reported at pH of 3 by Sobana and Swaminathan  (2007) and Wang et 
al. (2009) in their studies on the photocatalytic degradation of Direct Blue 53 and 
Acid Red B respectively under solar light. They explained that, it is due to the surface 
chemical state of TiO 2 and the ionization state of organic dye molecules at a certain 
pH. A summary of photocatalytic degradation of various dyes studied at different pH 
is given in Table 2.6. The review of literature supports the influence of pH on 
photocatalytic degradation of dyes and hence it is important to optim ize the pH 
conditions.  LITERATURE REVI EW

2.6.2.2 Effect of catalyst loading  
 
It is observed from reported literature, the rate of photocatalytic reaction increases 
with the catalyst loading, but after certain loading of the catalyst rate decreases and 
become independent of catalyst loading. Many authors have investigated the reacti on 
rate as a function of catalyst loading under different experimental conditions (San et 
al. 2001; Gouvea et al. 2000; Saquib and Munner 2002 ). Qamar et al. (2005a) 
investigated the effect of catalyst loading (0.5 -5 g/L) on the photocatalytic 
degradation of two selected dye derivatives, Chromotrope 2B and Amido Black 10B, 
using titanium dioxide as catalyst.  They have found increase in the degradation rate 
for the mineralization and decomposition of the model compounds, increase with the LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
52 
 increase in cataly st loading. Soutsas et al. (2010) studied the effect of catalyst loading 
(0.5-1.5 g/L) on decolorization and degradation of reactive azo dyes via 
heterogeneous photocatalytic processes. However, they found that, further increase in 
catalyst loading (>1 g/L ) does not lead to significantly higher decolorization 
efficiency. The catalyst amount has both positive and negative impact on the 
photodecomposition rate. The enhancement of the degradation rate with increase in 
catalyst loading has been attributed to (i ) increase in the number of dye molecules 
adsorbed, with the increase in the amount of catalyst loading. Catalyst addition 
increases the active sites for dye adsorption on the photocatalyst surface as well as the 
free hydroxyl radical (.ΟΗ) generation (Sou tsas et al. 2010)   (ii) increase in the 
density of particles in the area of illumination (Muruganandham and  Swaminathan 
2004).  
 Higher amount of catalyst may not be useful both in view of possible 
aggregation as well as reduced irradiation field due to increase in light scattering (Wei 
and Wan 1991). Furthermore, rate may decrease as a result of loss in surface area 
available for light -harvesting occasioned by agglomeration (particle -particle 
interactions) at high solid concentration. These two opposite phenomena results in an 
optimum catalyst loading for the photocatalysis process (Adesina 2004). In order to 
avoid excess catalyst (Hermann 1999) and to increase absorption capacity of photons 
the optimum catalyst loading is necessary. Soutsas et al. (2010)  studied the effect of 
catalyst loading (0.5 -1.5 g/L) on decolorization and degradation of reactive azo dyes 
via heterogeneous photocatalytic processes. They reported that decolorization 
efficiency increases with increase in TiO 2 loading, especially up to 1 g/L and further 
increase in catalyst loading (>1 g/L) does not lead to significantly higher 
decolorization efficiency. A summary of photocatalytic degradation of various dyes 
studied at different catalyst loading is given in Ta ble 2.7. The review of literature 
supports the influence of catalyst loading on photocatalytic degradation of dyes and 
hence it is important to optimize catalyst loading in order to avoid excess catalyst and 
to have maximum possible rate.

 2.6.2.3 Effect of concentration of dyes  
 
Initial concentration of a dye is an important parameter in the photocatalytic 
degradation of dyes. It was found that as the concentration increases rate of 
degradation decreases. A possible explanation for this is that as the initial 
concentration of the dye increases, the path length of the photons entering the solution 
decreases due to impermeability of the dye solution (Pare et al. 2008); a considerable 
quantity of light can be ab sorbed by the dye molecules rather than the catalyst and this 
may also decrease the catalytic efficiency because the concentrations of OH. and O.
2- 
decrease  (Daneshvar et al. 2004; Tang and An 1995; Mills et al. 1993) which leads to 
a decreased photodegra dation rate (Song et al.  2010). Another reason is with increase 
in dye concentration, adsorption of dye on catalyst surface also occur and hence the 
formation of OH. radicals decreases because active sites of catalyst are covered by 
ions of dye and thus af fects the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Hence, it was 
concluded by Neppolian et al. (2002a) that as initial concentration of the dye 
increases, the requirement of catalyst surface needed for the degradation also increase. 
Soutsas et al. (2010) studie d the effect of dye concentration (50 -250 mg/L) on 
heterogeneous photocatalytic decolorization and degradation of Reactive azo dyes and 
found that the decolorization efficiency (as %) decreases, while the amount of dye 
actually removed from the solution in creases, with increase in the initial dye 
concentration from 50 -250 mg/L. Kansal et al. (2006) investigated the effect of 
concentration (5 -200 mg/L) of dyes on Methyl Orange (MO) and Rhodamine 6G 
(R6G). As the concentration of the dye was increased, the ra te of photo decolorization 
decreased which indicated either to increase the catalyst dose or time span for the 
complete removal. A summary of photocatalytic degradation of various dyes studied 
at different concentrations is given in Table 2.8. Initial conc entration of dye is an 
important parameter to be studied in photocatalytic degradation, so as to obtain the 
optimum concentration for a given catalyst loading or to obtain the catalyst loading 
required for the given initial concentration.

 2.6.2.4 Effect of Oxidants  
 
UV photocatalytic process suffers from a relatively low apparent quantum yield due 
to the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. In irradiated 
photocatalyst suspensions, oxygen on the TiO 2 surface provides a natural sink for the 
electrons generated. OH radicals form via the oxidation of H 2O adsorbed on TiO 2 
surface or hydroxyl ions by the surviving holes (Jung et al. 2009).  
 Addition of oxidants can enhance the degradation rate in several ways 
(Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2004; Muruganand ham and Swaminathan 2006a; 
Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006b; Qamar et al. 2005a; Qamar et al. 2005b; 
Faisal et al. 2007; Rupa et al. 2007; Su et al. 2009): (i) When O 2 is used as an oxidant, 
it was found that the rate of photocatalysis increases. The in crease in degradation in 
presence of O 2 is due to decrease in rate of electron –hole recombination by adsorption 
of O 2 on the catalyst surface (Paola et al. 2003; Silva and Faria 2003). (ii) O 2 is the 
source of hydroxyl radicals and organic peroxides which are significant species for 
the degradation of dyes and intermediates and hence formation of these radicals 
depends on O 2. (iii) By preventing oxygen reduction. Molecular oxygen is most 
commonly used in heterogeneous catalysis. When O 2 is used as an oxidan t, it was 
found that the rate of photocatalysis increases.  
 Mirkhani et al.  (2009) investigated photocatalytic degradation of dyes in the 
presence of different flow rates of oxygen and results indicated that the presence of O 2 
is necessary. Gupta et al. (2006) investigated the photocatalytic degradation of a 
mixture of Crystal Violet (Basic Violet 3) and Methyl Red dye. The degradation of 
dyes decreased under limited supply of O 2 which indicated O 2 is essential for the 
photocat alysis process to occur.  
The introduction of a more effective electron acceptor than oxygen may be beneficial 
(Jung et al. 2009). As hydroxyl radicals play  an important role, besides the addition 
of molecular oxygen, many authors have studied the effect of other oxidants such as 
H2O2, (NH 4)2S2O8 and KBrO 3 on the photocatalytic degradation of different dyes LITERATURE REVI EW

 (Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2004 and 2006 a, b; Qamar et al. 2005a; Rupa et 
al. 2007; Su et al. 2009; Faisal et al. 2007).  
 Muruganandham and  Swaminathan (2004) studied the effect of addition of 
H2O2 (5-20 mM) on the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Orange 4 using TiO 2 
nanoparticles and found as concentration of H 2O2 (5-15 mM) was increased, 
degradation rate increased, but rate of degrada tion started decreasing with further  
increase in concentration of H 2O2 to 20 mM. They proposed that the increase of 
degradation is due to an increase in the hydroxyl radical concentration and decrease is 
due to scavenging effect of hydroxyl radical as sho wn by the following equations:  
                                  (2.12)                                                                                   
                         (2.13)  
H2O2 can also react with superoxide anion to form .OH radical  
                                                                                                (2.14)

 When (NH 4)2S2O8 was used as an oxidant by  Muruganandham and Swaminathan 
(2004 and 2006b) for the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Orange 4 and 
Reactive Yellow 14 using TiO 2 nanoparticles, it was found that the rate of degradation 
increased with the increase in concentration of (NH 4)2S2O8 upto certain level and then 
decreased with the increase in its concentrat ion. They hypothesized that, the increase 
in degradation is attributed to the inhibition of electron –hole recombination and 
production of other oxidizing species such as sulphate radical anion (Chen et al.  
2007). The sulphate radical anion (SO 4.-) is a ver y strong oxidant and it may react 
with photogenerated electron and with water molecule which results in production of 
hydroxyl radical as shown by the following equations:  
S2O82− + e−
(CB)→ SO4•− + SO42−             (2.17)  
SO4•− + e−
(CB) → SO42−              (2.18)  
SO4•− + H 2O → SO42−+ HO•+ H+             (2.19)  
At high concentration of (NH 4)2S2O8 rate of degradation of dyes decreases due to the 
adsorption of sulphate anion (SO 42-) on catalyst surface. Also SO 42- may react with 
photogenerated holes and hydroxyl radical which results in formation of SO 4.-. Since 
SO 4.- is less reactive than .OH radical and h+ and hence decrease the degradation of 
the dye as explained by following equations:  
SO42− + h+
(VB) → SO4•−              (2.20)  
SO42− + HO• → SO4•− + OH-              (2.21)  
 Increase in the rate of degradation with increase in addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 
upto a certain value and then a decrease in degradation with further increase in 
addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 was also ob served by Sobana et al.  (2008) in their studies  on 
the photocatalytic degradation of Direct Red 23 using nano Ag doped TiO 2 under UV 
irradiation. They found that (NH 4)2S2O8 concentration of 3 g/L is the optimum.  
 Increase in the rate of degradation of dyes with increase in concentration of 
persulfate has been reported for the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Yellow17 
using Ag doped TiO 2 (Rupa et al. 2007); Reactive Yellow 17 using TiO 2 (Neppolian 
et al. 2003), Acid Blue 80 using TiO 2 under solar l ight irradiation and during the 
photocatalytic degradation of Remazol Black 5 and Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R 
using mesoporous TiO 2 under UV irradiation (Chen et al.  2012).  LITERATURE REVI EW

  KBrO 3 is an efficient electron acceptor and it has been exploited as an additive 
to enhance rate of photocatalytic degradation (Gratzel et al. 1990; Sanchez et al. 1998; 
Poulios and Tsachpinis 1999). When KBrO 3 was added degradation rate was found to 
increase with the increase in concentration of KBrO 3 upto certain level but further 
increase in concentration of KBrO 3, then leads to decrease in the rate of degradation. 
Increase in the degradation of dyes with increased addition of KBrO 3 and then a 
decrease in degradation with its further increases has been reported by 
Muruganandham and Sw aminathan (2004) in their studies on the photocatalytic 
oxidation of Reactive Orange 4 under solar light and in studies by Sobana et al.  
(2008) on the photocatalytic degradation of Direct Red 23 using nano Ag doped TiO 2 
under UV irradiation. Increase in de gradation of the dyes with increased addition of 
KBrO 3 upto a certain concentration and then almost a constant value of degradation 
with further increase in KBrO 3 addition was reported by Muruganandham and 
Swaminathan (2006) in their studies on UV photocat alytic degradation of Reactive 
Yellow 14 and by Su et al.  (2009) in the photocatalytic degradation of Acid Blue 80 
using TiO 2 nanoparticles under solar light. Chen et al.  (2012) examined the effect of 
KBrO 3 (5-20 mM) on the photocatalytic degradation of Re mazol Black 5 and 
Remazol Brilliant Orange 3R using mesoporous TiO 2 under UV irradiation and found 
rate of degradation of both dyes increased with increase in concentration of KBrO 3 
from 5 to 20 mM.  
The enhancement of degradation rate is due to reduction of electron –hole 
recombination and formation of other radicals which helps in increasing the 
degradation rate as shown in equation (2.22).  
                                        (2.22)  
Further decrease is due to adsorption effect of Br- ion on catalyst  surface which affects 
the catalytic activity (Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2004; Muruganandham and 
Swaminathan 2006 and Sobana et al. 2008).

It can be seen from literature, activity of different oxidants and their concentrations 
may play an important role in improving the rate of photocatalytic degradation 
process. Thus in the current study, to increase the rate of degradation of dyes, 
photocatalysis was attempted with the addition of H 2O2, (NH 4)2S2O8, and KBrO 3 as 
oxidants.  
 
2.7 Optimization of photocatalysis process  
 
Feasibility of commercialization of any  process depends on the economics of the 
process. Drive is towards decreasing the cost of the process. Fixed cost of 
photocatalysis process may be reduced, if the rate of photocatalysis is enhanced to a 
considerable extent. Higher rate results in requireme nt for smaller size reactor for a 
given operation if the process is continuous or reduction in time needed for operation 
for a batch process. Rate of photocatalysis may be enhanced by operating the process 
at optimum conditions of pH, catalyst loading and oxidant concentration. Similarly 
the operating cost may be reduced if the amount of catalyst requirement and the 
concentration of oxidant are optimized to yield maximum rate of degradation, so that 
no excess chemicals or catalyst are used in the process.  
 The knowledge on interactions between the operational factors is important, 
particularly for optimizing the performance and minimizing the operation cost for an LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
67 
 industrial photocatalytic treatment processes. The conventional technique for 
optimization is v ery often by one -factor -at-a time approach,  while keeping other 
factors as constant. In this technique, the knowledge of the interaction between 
operational factors was often neglected.  However, this approach leads to inadequate 
optimization results. Moreover, one factor at a time approach is time consuming; 
efficiency of process is very less and they require many experiments to validate and 
correlate the interactions between the operatio nal factors involved. Though 
development of mathematical models based on first principles with process validation 
has been a common practice associated with many studies on modeling and 
optimization, it has serious limitations of availability of model para meter values. 
These parameter values need to be determined experimentally by independent 
experimentation. Accurate determination of model parameters may often be difficult, 
due to non availability of experimental methods.  
 Recently a number of statistical design of experiments (DOE) and data 
analysis techniques have been employed in various fields of process optimization 
(Levin et al.  2008; Chen et al. 2008a; Yu et al.  2008). In order to make out the effect 
of individual fac tors and to find the neighborhood of the optimum response, these 
designs include blocking and factorial experiments for determining the path of 
steepest ascent, (Box et al.   1978). In addition to that, Response Surface Methodology 
(RSM) is described as sui table method for illustrating a near optimum region and thus 
for exactly finding conditions for a multifactorial system. According to the 
observations of Myers et al.  (2006), the response surface framework has become the 
standard approach for much of the e xperimentation carried out in industrial research, 
development, manufacturing, and technology commercialization.  
 It is clear that RSM can play a crucial role in obtaining optimum 
photocatalytic reaction conditions. RSM is often based on statistically des igned set of 
experiments. RSM involves the design of experiments to describe the response as a 
function of several factors, the fitting of experimental result data to the empirical or 
theoretical models, the explanation of the nature of the fitted response  and the 
judgment of the adequacy of the model. RSM results in reduction of number of 
experiments without neglecting the interaction among the factors. The use of 
multivariate experimental design technique is becoming increasingly widespread in LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
68 
 applied cat alysis. Multivariate designs, which allow the simultaneous study of several 
control variables, are faster to implement and more cost effective than traditional 
univariate approaches (Montgomery 1997). But before going for experimental design 
models, experi ments to screen the factors are most important. This helps in 
determination of important factors which can influence the rate of photocatalysis. It is 
well known from literature review that, in photocatalysis, the factors that affect the 
degradation (respo nse) are dye concentration, catalyst loading, initial pH, electron 
acceptors and light intensity. As the factors influencing photocatalytic process are 
well documented, screening is not necessary in the current study. But to fix a proper 
range of operation al factors for designing the experiments and for optimization, 
preliminary studies are always essential.  
 Several experimental design models could be employed to reduce the number 
of experiments under different conditions. The most commonly used designs ar e 3k 
factorial, Doehlert, Box –Behnken and Central Composite Design (CCD) (Sakkas et 
al. 2010). Table 2.11 shows the application of DOE  in RSM for optimization of 
photocatalysis of dyes . A very useful experimental design for fitting second -order 
models is t he CCD. It consists of three types of points: cube, axial and centre points.  
The number of experiments required ( N) is given by  
                         (2.23)  
Where k is the number of variables,    is the number of cube points,    is the number 
of axial points and C0 is the number of center points (Sakkas et al. 2010). In CCD, 
central point is often used to find error. This design has been most widely used for the 
optimization of parameters affecting photocatalysis of dyes as it pro vides almost as 
much information as a multilevel factorial design, fewer experiments are needed as 
compared to full factorial design (Kasiri and Khatee 2011). So in the presently 
reported study, Central Composite Design was chosen for the optimization of 
operational factors for UV and solar photocatalysis of the dyes.

2.8 Reaction kinetics for dye degradation  
 
The photocatalytic process efficiency is one of the most critical factor that determines 
whether photocatalytic technique will be of any practical significance. From the 
reactor design point of view, for large scale application of photocatalysis of dyes in  
wastewater, determination of the rate equation governing photocatalytic process and 
the evaluation of the parameters of the rate equation are important. Kinetic studies of 
degradation helps in the prediction of rate equation. For semiconductor 
photocataly sis, to describe the rate of degradation of organic compounds a variety of 
models have been derived. Most kinetic models used in photocatalysis are based on 
the Langmuir -Hinshelwood (L -H) mechanism confirming the heterogeneous catalytic LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
71 
 characteristics of the system ( Ollis and Serpone 1989; Fox and Dulay 1993; 
Hoffmann et al. 1995; Mills and Le Hunte 1997). ). Many studies on the photocatalysis 
of organic pollutants have reported that the rate ( r) of photodegradation of the 
pollutant fits a Langmuir -Hinshelw ood model (Equation 2.24) (Turchi et al.  1989; 
Chen et al.  1998).  
                       
                               (2.24)  
Where ( –r) is the reaction rate of the pollutant being degraded, Cpollutant  is the 
concentration of the pollutant, kobs is the const ant related to adsorption and kR is the 
reaction rate constant. Both kobs and kR depend on the catalyst utilized and the nature 
of the pollutant.  
A photocatalytic reaction proceeds on the surface of semiconductors via several steps: 
(i) generation of electron –hole pairs by irradiation of the semiconductor with light 
energy content higher than the band gap energy of the semiconductor; (ii) separation  
of the photogenerated electrons and holes due to trapping by species, that are 
adsorbed on the semiconductor; (iii) redox reactions between the trapped electrons 
and holes and the adsorbents; (iv) desorption of reaction products and reconstruction 
of the surface (Fu et al.  1996; Li et al. 2011; Khezrianjoo and Revanasiddappa 2012).  
In Langmuir -Hinshelwood models, the surface of the catalyst is assumed as being 
energetically uniform, and it is assumed that there is no energetic interaction between 
species a dsorbed on the surface. Each reactant is assumed to adsorb on a surface site. 
Products are generated at the surface by surface reaction between adsorbed reactants 
and the products desorb from the surface. It is assumed that the surface reaction step 
is irr eversible and the adsorption/desorption steps are reversible. In the simplest form, 
L-H approach assumes one relatively rapid reaction achieving adsorption equilibrium 
(quasi -equilibrated) followed by a single slow surface reaction step (Murzin 2006) 
The f ree energy change associated with the quasi -equilibrated adsorption step is 
negligible compared to that of the surface reaction step. The surface reaction is thus 
called the rate determining step (RDS), since nearly all of the free energy change for 
the ov erall reaction is associated with that step (Davis and Davis 2003).  LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
72 
 To estimate the parameters of L -H kinetic model, it has been customary to write 
(Equation 2.24) in reciprocal form and then to plot the reciprocal initial reaction rate, 
1/(r0), versus the  reciprocal initial concentration, 1/ C0, as shown in Equation (2.25).  
  
    
                     
                 (2.25)  
 This method is called the method of initial rates (Levenspiel 1972). The 
constants kobs and kR may be determined f rom a plot of 1/ r0 versus  1/Cpollutant . If a 
catalytic system obeys  the Langmuir -Hinshelwood (L -H) model, the plot should be 
linear. The intercept of the  line with the y -axis provides       with the slope equal 
to          . Hence the parameters of the kinetic model can be evaluated.  
 This law successfully explains the kinetics of heterogeneous surface reactions 
as, it makes use of both reaction rate constant and adsorption equilibrium constant. At 
low pollutant concentration the catalyst surface will no t be saturated with pollutant, 
and then L -H kinetic model follows first order reaction equation. Several researchers 
have reported the validity of Langmuir Hinshelwood kinetic model to describe the 
kinetics of photocatalysis of dyes (Gupta et al. 2011; Gup ta et al.  2012 a, b; 
Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006 a, b).  
 
2.9 Effect of light intensity  
 
Light intensity is an important parameter as absorption of light by the catalyst and 
formation of electron –hole which is the initiation step in photocatalysis de pends on it 
(Cassano and Alfano 2000). Distribution of light intensity determines the degradation 
efficiency and pollutant conversion (Pareek et al. 2008). Ollis et al. (1991) reviewed 
the studies reported by different researchers on effect of light intens ity on rate of 
photocatalysis and stated that:  
i) At lower light intensities (0 –20 mW/cm2), the rate of degradation would increase 
linearly with increasing light intensity (Daneshvar et al.  2004; Muruganandham and 
Swaminathan 2006b).  
(ii) At intermediate light intensities (~ 25 mW/cm2), the rate of degradation would 
depend on the square root of the light intensity (Daneshvar et al.  2004; 
Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006b).  LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
73 
 (iii) At high light intensities the rate of degradation is independent of light i ntensity 
(Daneshvar et al. 2004; Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006b).  
 This is because at lower light intensity, photocatalysis process involves the 
formation of electron –hole which is the predominant step and electron –hole 
recombination is insignificant.  Hence the rate increases with the increase in light 
intensity. With further increase in intensities, the rate of degradation increases with 
the square root of the light intensity, as electron hole recombination can compete with 
charge carrier transfer due  to high intensity and lowers the effect on the reaction rate 
(Konstantinou and Albanis 2004).  
 Rashed and El -Amin (2007) investigated the effect of UV light intensity on 
Methyl Orange dye using TiO 2 nanoparticles and found, as the light intensity 
increases the rate of degradation increases. Similar results were reported by 
Konstantinou and Albanis (2004) and Hermann (1999) for the photocatalytic 
degradation of dyes. Muruganandham and Swaminathan (200 6b) examined the effect 
of UV light power on the degradation of Reactive Yellow 14.  Results showed that the 
degradation of dye increases with the increase in UV power from 16 to 32 W, but no 
considerable increase was observed between 32 to 48 W. Further i ncrease in light 
intensity from 48 to 64 W, showed independent behavior on degradation. Liu et al. 
(2006) studied the effect of UV light intensity on the photocatalytic degradation of 
Acid Yellow 17 and found that increase in light intensity increases the dye removal. 
Ku et al. (2011) examined the effect of UV light intensity (6.3 to 10.5 mW/cm2) on 
the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Red 22 dye. It was observed, degradation 
of dye increased linearly with the increase in UV light intensity. Bouanimba  et al.  
(2011) examined the effect of UV light intensity (2 to 10 mW/cm2) on the 
photocatalytic degradation of Bromophenol Blue  dye. Results showed, with increase 
in light intensity rate of degradation increases and linear relationship was observed. 
Gupta et al.  (2011) investigated the effect of UV light intensity (8 to 14 mW/cm2) on 
the photocatalytic degradation of Tartrazine dye using TiO 2 and found a linear 
relationship between rate of dye degradation and light intensity. The increased rate of 
degradati on with increase in light intensity is attributed to the formation of more 
hydroxyl radical as more radiations fall on the catalyst surface. Neppolian et al.  
(2002b) studied the effect of solar light intensity at various time intervals on LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
74 
 photocatalytic de gradation of textile dye Reactive Blue 4 using TiO 2. The maximum 
degradation of dye was observed during April –June; peak summer period of the year 
in Chennai, India. Park et al.  (2004) investigated the effect of UV light intensity on 
solar light induced de gradation of Reactive Dye (Red120) using photocatalysis. Three 
experiments were conducted on; clear sky, partly cloudy and thick cloudy sky. It was 
observed dye decolourisation on clear sky day was about three and thirteen times 
higher than partly cloudy a nd thick cloudy sky. The rate of decolorisation of dye 
increased linearly with increase in UV light intensity. Jeni and Kanmani (2011) 
examined the effect of solar UV light intensity on photocatalytic decolorisation of 
reactive dyes using TiO 2. Results sho wed that with increase in solar UV light 
intensity, decolorisation of both dyes increased and maximum is observed with UV 
light intensity of 31 W/m2. 
As the light intensity plays a very important role in photocatalysis, it was proposed to 
study the effect of light intensity on rate of photocatalysis.  
 
2.10 Effect of addition of salts (NaCl, Na 2CO 3) 
 
Presence of interfering substances plays an important role in the degradation of dyes. 
In textile industries, NaCl and Na2CO 3 play an important role in transferring dye to 
fabric and in adjusting pH of dye bath which is necessary in fixing dye on the fabrics 
(Arslan et al. 1991). Large amount of these salts get wasted during dyeing process and 
therefore, the dye industry wastewa ter contains a considerable amount of carbonate 
and chloride ions. Waste water containing anions (Cl−, CO 32−) decrease the rate of the 
reaction and affect the water transmittance. Hence, it is important to study the 
influence of CO 32- and Cl- ions on the p hotocatalytic degradation of dyes.  
 Neppolian et al. (2003) studied the effects of NaCl and Na 2CO 3 on the 
photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Yellow 17 dye; the percentage degradation of 
dye decreased gradually with increase in carbonate ion concentration. The decrease in 
degradation of the dye in the presence of carbonate ions is attributed to the hydroxyl 
scavenging property of carbonate ions as explained in following reactions (Behar et 
al. 1970; Neppolian et al. 2003).  
                                   (2.26)  LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
75 
                                   (2.27)  
It can be seen from the above react ions, carbonate radical which is very less active 
than .OH radical, is produced and hence results in lower degradation. Also with 
increase in CO 32− concentration, .OH which is a primary source responsible for 
photocatalysis of dyes decreases, and as a resu lt percentage degradation of dyes 
decreases. In the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Dyes, similar trend was 
observed (Nansheng et al. 1996).  
             With the increase in concentration of Cl-, degradation of dye decreases. The 
decrease in degradation of dye with increase in Cl- concentration is attributed to the 
hole scavenging property of Cl- ion as explained in the following reactions 
(Bockelmann et al. 1996).  
                             (2.28)  
                                       (2.29)  
 It can be seen from theabove reactions, chloride radical anion is produced 
which blocks the active surface sites available at the catalyst surface. These chloride 
radical anions are not readily oxidizable and hence results in decrease in the 
degradation of dyes.  
 Muruganandham and Swaminathan (2004) investigated the effect of Cl- and 
CO 32- on the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Orange 4. Rate of degradation of 
dye was found to decrease with the addition of Cl- and CO 32-. Addition of Cl- and 
CO 32- from 1 to 4 g/L resulted in decrease in degradation of dye and around 60 % and 
55 % (after 60 min irradiation time) degradation of dye was observed with the 
addition of Cl- and CO 32- respectively. Bouanimba et al.  (2013) investigated the effect 
of Cl- and CO 32− on the photocatalytic degradation of Methyl Orange dye. Results 
showed that in presence of Cl- and CO 32−, rate of degradation is hindered. Sohrabi et 
al. (2009) investigated the effect of Cl- on the photocatalytic degradation of Benziden 
Yellow and found decrease in degradation in the presence of Cl-. Decrease in 
degradation of dyes with increase in Cl- (0.02 mol) was also reported by Mahmoodi, 
(2013) during the photocatalytic degradation of D irect Red 23 and Direct Red 31 dyes 
using carbon nanotube and TiO 2 nanoparticles as photocatalysts.  LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
76 
 Since the presence of different salts in textile effluents may interfere with the 
degradation of dyes, it is necessary to study the effect of the presence o f these salts on 
photocatalytic degradation of dyes.  
 
2.11 Photocatalytic mineralization of dyes   
 
The degradation of dyes leads to the conversion of organic carbon into harmless 
gaseous CO 2 and that of nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms into inorganic ions, such as 
nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, chloride etc. During photocatalysis process extent of 
mineralization reached is generally assessed by the formation of inorganic ions and 
further mineraliz ation to CO 2 and H 2O (Bianco -Prevot et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 1998; 
Liu et al. 1999; Stylidi et al. 2003; Tanaka et al. 2000; Spadaro et al. 1994). However, 
in textile effluents information on the real decay of pollutant is not provided and 
monitoring of i norganic ions, only offers a global estimation on the well -functioning 
of the treatment. So in textile industries, estimation of mineralization of dyes is 
generally done by measuring total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand 
(COD) and biological o xygen demand (BOD) (Neppolian et al. 2002 a, b; Zhang et al. 
1998; Sakthivel et al. 2003; So et al. 2002; Tanaka et al. 2000; Hu et al. 2003; Chun 
and Yizhong 1999). Until now, most of photocatalysis studies showed mineralization 
of azo dyes as evidenced b y decrease in TOC and COD with increase in irradiation 
time (Sakthivel et al. 2003; Stylidi et al. 2003; Tanaka et al. 2000; Gouvea et al. 
2000). The COD is widely used as an effective technique to measure the organic 
strength of wastewater. The test allow s the measurement of wastes in terms of the 
total quantity of oxygen required for oxidation of organic matter to CO 2 and water. 
The reduction in COD and TOC values of the treated dye solution indicates the 
mineralization of dye molecules along with color r emoval. Usually exponential or 
sigmoidal shapes were observed with COD or TOC curves which mean small 
decrease in COD or TOC values when solution is still colored and sharp decrease 
when solution becomes colourless (Stylidi et al. 2003; So et al. 2002; Chu n and 
Yizhong 1999). According to these researchers a small decrease in TOC or COD 
values is due to the decomposition of dye molecules to lower molecular weight 
compounds and sharp decrease corresponds to oxidation of most stable compounds LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
77 
 which indicates the complete mineralization of intermediates. So in the present study 
TOC and COD measurement were carried out in order to check for mineralization of 
dyes.  
 Inorganic ions such as chlorides, sulphates, nitrates and nitrites are formed by 
mineralization f rom the chlorine, nitrogen and sulphur containing heteroatoms in 
dyes. It was reported by Sakthivel et al.  (2003) that,   for chlorinated dye molecules, 
chloride ions are first to appear during photocatalysis. Wang et al.  (2000) studied the 
photocatalytic degradation of dyes with chloride substitute and reported that the 
release product of chlorinated dye depends upon the position in which it is attached to 
molecular structure. Nitrogen containing groups are mineralized to nitrate, nitrite and 
ammonium ions  and the proportion mainly depends on the irradiation time, structure 
of dye and oxidation of nitrogen groups  (Nohara et al. 1997; Puzenat et al.  2003). It 
was reported by Stylidi et al.  (2003) at the end of experiment the total amount of 
nitrogen containi ng ions is usually lower than the stoichiometry. It may be due to 
adsorption on photocatalyst surface or production of nitrogen and ammonia gas. The 
dyes containing sulphonic groups or sulphur atoms are mineralized into sulphate ions 
and in most studies st oichiometry were observed (So et al.  2002).  
 So in the presently reported study, it was proposed to analyze COD removal, 
TOC removal and formation of sulphate, nitrate, nitrite and chloride ions in order to 
check mineralization of dyes.  
 
2.12 Photocataly tic degradation of mixture of dyes  
 
In the application of photocatalysis for treatment of wastewater from textile 
industries, the effluent will normally consist of a mixture of many dyes rather than a 
single dye and their interaction may mutually improve o r reduce photocatalysis 
process. Numerous papers have been published for dye degradation with single 
component system but very limited studies have been reported for mixture of dyes.  
 Ong et al.  (2013) investigated solar photocatalytic degradation of mono  azo 
Methyl Orange and diazo Reactive Green 19 in single and binary dye solutions using 
TiO 2 nanoparticles. Their studies showed removal efficiency of 56 and 98 % for 
Methyl Orange and Reactive Green 19, respectively in binary dye solution. The LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
78 
 photocataly tic degradation of both dyes were found to be less in binary dye solution 
as compared to single dye solution which may be due to competitive nature of dyes 
towards reactive sites on TiO 2 nanoparticles. Also no interactions of dyes were 
observed and hence a nalysis of dyes was done at their corresponding λmax values . 
 Sahel et al. (2010) studied the photocatalytic degradation of a mixture of two 
anionic dyes: Procion Red MX -5B and Remazol Black 5 using TiO 2 nanoparticles 
under UV light. Their studies showed, at lower concentration (3 µmol/L) of mixture 
of dyes rate of degradation was similar to rate of degradation of individual dye but at 
higher concentration (10 µmol/L) rate of degradation decreased due to limited number 
of available sites on TiO 2 surface. No  complex formation was observed with mixture 
of dyes hence concentrations of each dye were measured at their λmax values.  
 Damodar et al. (2009) examined the photocatalytic degradation of a mixture of 
Acid Yellow and Reactive Red (25 and 50 mg/L each) dyes  using immobilized TiO 2 
under UV light irradiation and observed rate of removal of mixture of dyes decreased 
as compared to individual dye solution. This proves the inhibition of degradation of a 
dye due to the presence of other dyes in mixture due to comp etition for reactive sites 
on catalyst surface. Also the absorption spectra of mixture of dyes did not show any 
change in λmax values and hence the degradation was studied by dye analysis 
separately at their corresponding λmax values . 
 Gupta et al. (2006) studied photocatalytic degradation of a mixture of Crystal 
Violet (Basic Violet 3) and Methyl Red dye using Ag ion doped TiO 2 nanoparticles 
under UV light irradiation. Their studies showed no interaction effect of dyes with 
each other a nd analysis of dyes was done at their corresponding λmax values . With 
different proportions of Crystal Violet (Basic Violet 3) and Methyl Red dye, almost 
99 % degradation of both dyes occurred within 90 min of UV irradiation.  
Since the presence of one or more of the dyes in wastewater, may interfere with the 
degradation of a specific dye , it is necessary to study the effect of mixture of dyes on 
photocatalysis. The optimum conditions obtained for maximum degradation of one of 
the dyes in a mixture may prov e to be sub optimal for other dyes and hence choosing 
the conditions favorable for the degradation of all the dyes in the wastewater 
contaminated with several dyes may be a challenging task. There are no studies 
reported so far on choice of optimal conditi ons for wastewater containing two or more LITERATURE REVI EW

 dyes. An attempt has been made in the present study to suggest a suitable 
methodology to choose an appropriate optimal condition for treatment of wastewater 
containing mixture of dyes.  
 
2.13 Identification of degra dation products, their intermediates and the 
degradation pathway  
 
The photocatalytic degradation of dyes to simpler compounds is not a one step 
reaction. In order to improve our knowledge about degradation pathway and to 
determine which specific compounds are produced in the effluent (Konstantinou and 
Albanis 2004), it i s necessary to identify the intermediates and degradation products. 
This may also reveal which step is crucial for the large -scale application of 
photocatalysis process and help in evaluation of kinetics of formation and 
decomposition of the byproducts. To  maximize the overall efficiency of the 
photocatalysis process, identification of intermediates is one of the main key factors. 
A variety of intermediates are produced during photocatalysis due to non -selective 
reaction of hydroxyl radical and various anal ytical techniques such as high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Galindo et al. 2000; Bandara et al. 
1999; Baiocchi et al. 2002), gas chromatography –mass spectrometry (GC –MS) (Liu 
et al. 1999; Stylidi et al. 2003; Daneshvar et al. 2003; Galindo et al. 2000), liquid 
chromatography –mass spectrometry (LC –MS) (Meetani et al. 2010; Bansal and Sud 
2010; Bansal and Sud 2012) and FT -IR (Stylidi et al. 2003; Galindo et al. 2001; 
Lucarelli et al. 2000; Hu et al. 2003; Nasr et al. 1996) were used for the deter mination 
of organic intermediates.  
 Hisaindee et al. (2013) reviewed application of LC -MS to find the 
intermediate products and reaction mechanisms of dye degradation during advanced 
oxidation process (AOP). Rajeshwar et al. (2008) reviewed the degradatio n 
mechanism of azo dyes (Congo Red, Acid Orange 7, Disperse Red 13, Reactive Black 
5, Acid Orange 52, Reactive Yellow 145, and Disperse Red 1 etc.) and non azo dyes 
(Acid Blue 80, Methylene Blue, Reactive Blue 4, Rhodamine B, Alizarine Red, Eosin 
etc) duri ng heterogeneous photocatalysis and reported the formation of various 
reaction intermediates.  LITERATURE REVI EW

  Photocatalytic degradation products of Acid Orange 7 dye were identified 
using GC -MS by Stylidi et al.  (2003). Karkmaz et al.  (2004) proposed the degradation 
pathway of Amaranth dye for the evaluation of aliphatic organic acids during TiO 2 
mediated photocatalysis. Hasnat et al.  (2005) compared the photocatalytic degradation 
pathway of Methylene Blue (cationic dye) and Procion Red (anionic dye) using TiO 2 
as catal yst under visible light and found degradation pathway of Procion Red to be 
somewhat different from Methylene Blue. Bansal et al. (2010) examined the 
photocatalytic degradation and mineralization extent of Acid Orange 7 dye in aqueous 
suspension of TiO 2. To  judge the degradation pathway of Acid Orange 7 dye, 
mechanism of formation of intermediates and final products were monitored by 
LC/MS. Meetani et al.  (2010) studied the photocatalytic degradation of diazo dye 
(Amido Black) using UV/H 2O2 and detailed study was carried out to establish 
degradation pathway and intermediates produced. The dye degradation proceeded 
with the attack of hydroxyl radical at electron deficient nitrogen and further pathway 
included radical denitration, radical desu lfonation and radical diazotization of Amido 
Black dye. Fabbri et al. (2010) examined the degradation of Acid Violet 7 (azo dye) 
and Acid Green 25 (anthraquinone) dye using TiO 2 as photocatalyst. In their studies, 
dye degradation, mineralization and identi fication of intermediates were done by LC -
MS and degradation pathway was reported. Complete mineralization of both dyes and 
conversion of sulfonic groups into sulphate ion and nitrogen into nitrate and 
ammonium ions were observed. Natarajan et al. (2011) s tudied the photocatalytic 
mineralization, identification of intermediates and degradation pathway of 
photocatalysis of Rhodamine B dye with TiO 2 catalyst under UV/LED light 
irradiation. Kalsoom et al. (2012) investigated the degradation mechanism of Remazo l 
Turquoise Blue  dye with LC -MS during photolysis with UV/H 2O2 and found after 
120 min of irradiation time, dye was broken down and new products were formed. 
Bansal and Sud (2013) studied the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Red 35 in 
aqueous suspens ion of TiO 2 under UV light and found degradation pathway and 
identified the intermediates by LC/MS.    
The review of literature suggested the importance of degradation pathway and 
mechanism of dye degradation. Several researchers have successfully establis hed the 
degradation pathway by analysis and identification of intermediates and products of LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
81 
 degradation using LC/MS. So in the presently reported study, identification of 
intermediates and products produced during photocatalysis was carried out using 
LC/MS .  
 
2.14 Immobilized photocatalysts  
 
Photocatalyst can be employed either in a colloidal form or in an immobilized form 
(Chun et al. 2001; You et al. 2001; Chai et al. 2000). Most of the experimental work 
on aqueous systems has been carried out using phot ocatalysts in the form of fine 
particles suspended in the liquid phase, but the main drawback of this process is that 
the separation of photocatalyst from the solution is expensive. The separation process 
is more challenging when the photocatalyst is nanos ized. Use of suspended 
nanoparticles as photocatalysts in continuous photocatalytic reactor has drawbacks in 
terms of retainment of nanoparticles in the reactor, as these catalyst nanoparticles may 
get washed away with the reactor effluents. In photoreacto rs operated with catalyst 
particles as slurry, the use of suspensions requires the separation and recycling of the 
nanosized catalyst from treated liquid and it can be an inconvenient, time consuming 
and expensive process. The requirement of separation of ultra fine catalyst particles 
from treated liquid hinders the wide application of slurry photocatalytic reaction 
systems. Attention is also given to the development of reactor configurations which 
allow the debottlenecking of typical problems related to th e use of slurry 
photocatalytic reactors, such as the separation of the catalyst powders from the 
product stream. For instance, Chin et al.  (2006; 2007) developed a submerged 
membrane photocatalytic reactor using membrane to separate TiO 2 from the effluent;  
however, the problem of membrane fouling happened occasionally. The above 
problems can be avoided in photocatalytic reactors where the catalyst particles are 
immobilized on a support or carrier. Hence, to avoid the cost of separation of small 
catalyst par ticles from treated water and also to retain constant catalyst loading in the 
reactor throughout the operation, methods of fixing the catalyst on the support within 
the reactor has also been investigated which in many cases showed higher 
photocatalytic act ivity than the parent TiO 2 (Xu and Langford 1997; Chun et al. 
2001). It is promising to employ the immobilized photocatalysts in photocatalytic LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
82 
 reactors. Puttamraju and Ray (2008) found that the removal rates of Methyl Ethyl 
Ketone in gas phase was  higher  for the catalysts supported on different adsorbents as 
compared to bare TiO 2 (Degussa P25 and sol -gel TiO 2) due to both improved 
adsorption and photocatalytic degradation. Recently, the photoreactor design oriented 
to developing immobilized forms. Thus, v arious materials such as activated carbon 
(Torimoto et al. 1997), silica gel (Belhekar et al. 2002) and zeolite (Reddy et al. 2003) 
were selected as photocatalyst support to condense pollutants in bulk solution for 
degradation.  Usually supports are classif ied by their chemical nature to organic and 
inorganic supports. Whatever the support is, it plays an important role in 
immobilizing active catalyst. Principally, the support has three main functions: (i) to 
increase the surface area of catalytic  material, (ii) to decrease sintering and to improve 
hydrophobicity and thermal, hydrolytic, and chemical stability of the catalytic 
material, and (iii) to govern the useful lifetime of the catalyst ( Matatov -Meytal and 
Sheintuch 1998). Support may also improve the ac tivity of the catalyst by acting as a 
co-catalyst. Surface bound -conjugated TiO 2/SiO 2 was prepared by means of 
impregnation method for photocatalysis of azo dyes by Chun et al. (2001). This TiO 2 
fixed on silica gel showed three times higher photoactivity f or the degradation of 
reactive dye. Noorjahan et al. (2003) reported the photodegradation of H -acid over a 
novel TiO 2 thin film fixed bed reactor by immobilized TiO 2 Degussa P -25 on inert 
cuddapah stone. Gopalkrishnan and Mohan (1997) carried out photodegr adation of 
few textile dyes using TiO 2 in fixed mode i.e. by coating TiO 2 on sand and hollow 
glass beads. Subramanyam et al. (1998) have studied photocatalytic degradation of 
textile dyes: Vat Blue, Fast Orange GC Base by immobilizing TiO 2 on ceramic beads 
and SiO 2. TiO 2 has been affixed to a variety of surfaces like glass, silica, metals, 
ceramics, polymers etc. (Lei et al. 1999; Liu et al. 2000; Miller et al. 1999; Shchukin 
et al. 1999; Sirisuk et al. 1999; Rao et al. 2003; Fernandez et a l. 2004). Photocatalytic 
degradation of various dyes using solar light as an irradiation source and immobilized 
TiO 2 as a photocatalyst showed the potential application for the decolorization of 
wastewater (Cangcang and Dewan 1998). Photocatalytic degradat ion of a few dyes 
has been successfully carried out using immobilized ZnO films (Roselin et al. 2002; 
Comparelli et al. 2004; Yoshida et al. 2002). Robert et al. (1999) have presented the 
preparation of TiO 2 supported on glass -fibre by sol -gel method. The supported LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
83 
 catalysts showed a good photocatalytic activity towards benzamide. However, the 
reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) with supported TiO 2 was very slow. This 
observation carries out that the degradation process is not the same as that with the 
classical TiO 2-P25. Mills et al. (2002) have prepared a novel chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) film of titanium (IV) oxide on glass via the reaction of titanium 
(IV) chloride and ethyl acetate, using a CVD technique. The film was reported to be 
active photo catalytically and was able to destroy a deposited layer of stearic acid upon 
exposure to UV light. Neppolian et al. (2003) examined the photocatalytic 
degradation of common textile dye, Reactive Yellow 17 by photocatalysis over TiO 2 
(Degussa P25) photocata lyst coated on the glass plates (reactor) using cement as a 
binder employing solar energy  and found that it is a suitable technique for removal of 
colored wastewater from textile industries. Lim and Kim (2005) used TiO 2 coated on 
silica gel for photocatal ytic degradation of trichloroethylene in fluidized bed reactor. 
Na et al. (2005) showed that the photocatalytic fluidized bed reactor with the hollow 
ceramic ball coated with TiO 2, effectively photocatalyzed the degradation of 
Rhodamine B dye. Behnajady et al. (2007) investigated the photocatalytic degradation 
of Acid Red 27 with immobilized TiO 2 on glass plates in a tubular continuous -flow 
photoreactor under UV light. Damodar et al.  (2009) examined the photocatalytic 
degradation of a mixture of Acid Yellow  and Reactive Red (25 and 50 mg/L each) 
dyes using TiO 2 nanoparticles immobilized on poly vinyl chloride(PVC) tube under 
UV light irradiation. Fathinia et al.  (2010) compared photocatalytic degradation of 
two dyes having different structure using TiO 2 nano particles immobilized on glass 
plates. Many techniques have been devised to fix TiO 2 to a substrate, and research is 
ongoing. Immobilization techniques have been used successfully to fix TiO 2 to many 
supports, such as glasses (Fernandez et al. 1995; Rachel  et al. 2002; Mills et al. 2002; 
Takeda et al. 2001), Quartz (Fernandez et al. 1995; Harizanov and Harizanova 2000), 
ceramics ( Na et al. 2005 , Mills et al. 2002), Optical fibres (Wang and Ku 2003; Peill 
et al. 1997), fabrics (Park and na 2008; Bottcher et al. 2010), polymers (Langlet et al. 
2002), silica gel (Ding et al. 2001), activated carbon (Ding et al. 2001) and zeolite 
(Zainudin et al. 2008). Essentially the immobilization matrix needs to be 
mechanically robust, and must maintain a high level of photo activity. One important 
drawback in application of immobilized catalysts is the mass transfer limitations. LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
84 
 When the catalyst particles are coated on to a support, the organic pollutants in water 
should transfer from the bulk liquid phase to the surface of the catalyst film and also 
to its interiors for effective utilization of the available catalyst surface. Even when the 
catalyst particles are entrapped in a support matrix, the organic molecules from water 
should diffuse through the matrix to reach the ent rapped catalyst particles. This may 
offer diffusional mass transfer limitations to photocatalytic process and the overall 
photocatalytic degradation rate may become mass transfer limited. The research drive 
is to choose suitable immobilization matrix which  are simple, cheap and which offer 
no mass transfer limitations on the process, which implies that the rate of 
photocatalysis with immobilized system should at least be similar to that with free 
nanoparticles.  
 In recent years, polymers such as chitosan ( Singh et al. 2011b), cellulose 
acetate (Wu et al. 2005), PVA (Lei et al. 2012) and sodium alginate (Kim et al. 2010) 
have been used as support materials for nanoparticle immobilization due to their 
biodegradable nature. So in the present study cellulose acetate and chitosan matrices 
were used for immobilization of the nanoparticles.  
  
2.15.  Scope and objectives of research work  
 
Based on extensive review of literature, it was hypothesized that, with suitable 
modifications in the synthesis of Ag@TiO 2 nanop articles, solar photocatalytic activity 
can be imparted and UV photocatalytic activity can be enhanced. It was proposed to 
synthesize Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles by one pot synthesis route of Hirakawa and Kamat 
(2005) with suitable modifications to enhance their  UV photocatalytic activity and to 
impart solar photocatalytic activity. Research work was planned and designed based 
on the key research questions driven by the hypothesis mentioned above. The key 
research questions were: (i) whether or not, by properly e ngineering the Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles through optimization of Ag to Ti molar ratio during synthesis, 
calcination temperature and calcination time, good UV and solar photocatalytic 
activity can be imparted to the nanoparticles (ii) what characteristics of th ese 
nanoparticles are responsible for imparting the photocatalytic activity? (iii) whether 
these nanoparticles can be used for removal of complex azo dyes such as Acid LITERATURE REVI EW 
 
 
 
85 
 yellow -17 and Reactive Blue -220 by photocatalytic degradation under UV light and 
solar l ight? (iv) whether these nanoparticles have better photocatalytic activity than, 
the other conventional photocatalysts? (v) which factors influence the photocatalysis 
process catalyzed by these nanoparticles and how? (vi) whether optimization of 
operationa l factors improve the rate of photocatalysis? (vii) whether the photocatalytic 
activity of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles better  under UV light irradiation or solar light 
irradiation? (vii) whether these nanoparticles can be recycled and reused as 
photocatalysts? (viii) how does light intensity affect the rate of photocatalysis? (x) 
whether the presence of salts like NaCl and Na 2CO 3 in effluents, which are added 
during dyeing operation in textiles, influence the photocatalysis rate? (xi) what is the 
kinetic model g overning the rate of photocatalysis of the dyes? (xii) what is the extent 
of mineralization of AY -17 and RB -220 during photocatalysis?, (xiii) what is the 
mechanism of degradation and the degradation pathway for these dyes?, (xiv) how 
efficiently the optim um conditions devised for the degradation of single dye solution 
can be used for degradation of dyes in an aqueous solution containing mixture of 
dyes? (xv) Photocatalyst can be employed either in a colloidal form or in an 
immobilised form. In photoreactor s operated with catalyst particles as slurry, the use 
of suspension requires the separation and recycling of the nanosized catalyst from the 
treated liquid and can be an inconvenient, time consuming and expensive process. 
Catalysts can be immobilized on su pports to overcome these limitations. But 
immobilized nano photocatalysts may lead to mass transfer limitations. So the 
research question was, how efficient are nanoparticles immobilized on biodegradable 
polymeric matrix such as cellulose acetate and chito san beads, in comparison with 
free nanoparticles in terms of degradation of the dyes? (xvi) whether these engineered 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles can be used for the photocatalytic degradation of other class 
of dyes?  
Based on the critical understanding of the pro blem, extensive review of literature, key 
research questions raised and the need  for research in this area the following 
objectives were formulated for the research work.

3.2 Preparation of Ag@TiO 2 
 
To synthesize Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles, one pot synthesis method 
of hydrolysis of TTEAIP and the reduction of metal ions in dimethyl formamide, as 
has been followed by Hirakawa and Kamat (2005) was used, but with modification in 
terms of Ag to Ti ratio used during synthesis. 8.3 mM TTEAIP solution was prepared 
in 2-propanol and 15 mM of AgNO 3 solution was prepared in distilled water. Two mL 
of 15 mM AgNO 3 solution was mixed with 18 mL of TTEAIP solution. The molar 
concentration ratio of Ag+ and TTEAIP in the reaction mixture was then 1:5. The 
molar concentration ratio of AgNO 3 and TTEAIP, and hence the molar ratio of Ag to MATERIALS AND METHODS

 Ti in the reaction mixture was varied as 1:5, 1:3.1, 1:2.2, 1:1.67 and 1:0.8 by  suitably 
varying the volumes of AgNO 3 and TTEAIP solution added, keeping the total volume 
constant.  Table 3.2 presents the volume of AgNO 3 and TTEAIP solutions mixed to 
make a synthesis mixture with the desired Ag to Ti molar ratios. The solution was 
placed in a three necked flask with magneti c stirrer and equipped with a reflux 
condenser. Figure 3.1 shows the schematic diagram of laboratory scale reactor used 
for the synthesis of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. The mixture was stirred for 15 min at 
room temperature and ten mL of DMF was then added into  TTEAIP -Ag solution. The 
mixture was heated with reflux in a temperature controlled thermostatic heating 
mantle with continued stirring. With continued heating of the solution at 85 ºC, the 
colour slowly changed from colourless to light brown. After 90 min , the colour of the 
suspension turned to dark brown. At this point, the heating was stopped and the 
suspension was stirred until it was cooled to room temperature.  The cluster 
suspension of Ag@TiO 2 was kept for settling in a beaker for 1 h and then centri fuged 
at 10000 rpm at 10 ºC for 10 min. Ag@TiO 2 particles were separated and resuspended 
in ethanol solution. The procedure of suspension in ethanol and centrifugation was 
repeated at least 3 -times to minimize the content of water and DMF in the suspension . 
After repeated ethanol washing and centrifugation, the particles were dried in a hot air 
oven at 100 °C for two hours. The particles were then calcined at a temperature 
ranging from 150 °C to 550 °C as desired, in a muffle furnace for a calcination time 
of 3 h. To study the effect of calcination time, the calcination was carried out for 
different time periods of 1 to 5 h as desired. After the calcination, the particles were 
stored as suspension in ethanol until further use. Prior to use, the particles wer e 
separated from ethanol by centrifugation and dried.

 3.3.1 Synthesis of TiO 2 nanoparticles using combustion synthesis ( CSTiO 2) 
method  
 
To synthesize TiO 2 using combustion synthesis method, the methodology followed by 
Nagaveni  et al. ( 2004 ) was adopted . A beaker containing 100 mL of distilled water 
was kept in a water bath at room temperature. 8.8 mL of TTIP solution was added 
drop wise to the distilled water. The mixture was stirred continuously using a 
magnetic stirrer for twenty minutes until a curdy white precipitate of titanyl hydroxide 
was obtained. 100 mL of concentrated HNO 3 was added very slowly to the above 
suspension. A clear light yellow solution of titanyl nitrate was obtained. Then 2.5024 
g of glycine was added to the solution. The solution was transferred to silica crucible 
and kept in a muffle furnace at 350 °C for 15  min. At the end of 15 min, a white 
powder of TiO 2 was obtained. TiO 2 was then calcined at 450 °C in a muffle furnace 
for 3 h.  
 
3.3.2 Synthesis of TiO 2 nanoparticles using sol gel (SGTiO 2) method  
 
TiO 2 was synthesized using sol gel method as per the methodology explained by Rupa 
et al. (2009).  17 mL of TTIP was mixed with 40 mL of 2 -propanol. This mixture was 
added drop wise into a mixture consisting of 5 mL water , 15 mL acetic acid  and 60 
mL 2 -propanol  with vigorous stirring for 2 h . The gel obtained was then dried in an 
oven at  
105 °C for 12 h until it turns into white block crystals. Then these particles were 
calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 3 h.  
 
3.4 Synthesis of Ag doped TiO 2 nanoparticle s 
 
In the synthesis of Ag doped TiO 2 nanoparticles, Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 was 
used.  This ratio was the optimum ratio obtained for core shell nanoparticles for 
maximum degradation of the dyes. Ag doped TiO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized by 
three di fferent methods: sol gel method, liquid impregnation method and 
photodeposition method described below.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
96 
 3.4.1 Synthesis of Ag doped TiO 2 nanoparticles  by sol gel (Ag doped -SGTiO 2) 
method  
 
The synthesis of Ag doped TiO 2 using sol gel method was carried out using the 
methodology followed by Zhang et al. (2008).  17 mL of TTIP was mixed with 40 mL 
of 2-propanol by magnetic stirring and the mixture was marked as solution A. 3.53 g 
of AgNO 3 was added to a mixture consisting of 10 mL water, 10 mL acetic acid, and 
40 mL of 2 -propanol and marked as solution B. Solution A was added drop -wise into 
solution B with vigorous stirring at room temperature. After addition, the solution was 
further stirred for about 1 h and then dried in  an oven at 105 °C for 12 h. Then these 
particles were calcined in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 3 h.  
 
3.4.2 Synthesis of Ag doped TiO 2 nanoparticles  by liquid impregnation (Ag 
doped (LI) - CSTiO 2) method  
 
Ag doped TiO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized by l iquid impregnation method as per 
the methodology explained by Sahoo et al. (2005) and Behnajady et al. (2008 ).  In the 
liquid impregnation  method, silver ion (Ag+) doped TiO 2 was prepared according to 
the following steps. 3 g of TiO 2 powder prepared by combustion synthesis method 
explained in Section 3.3.1 were added to 100 mL of deionized water. Then 3.923 g of 
AgNO 3 was added to TiO 2 suspension for doping such that Ag to Ti ratio on molar 
basis was 1:1.7 as per the requirement. The slurry was stirred well and allowed to rest 
for 24 h and then dried in a hot air oven at 100 °C for 12 h. The dried solids were 
ground in an agate mortar and calcined at 450 °C for 3 h in a muffle furnace.

(PD) - CSTiO 2) method  
 
To synthesize Ag doped TiO 2 using photodeposition  method, the procedure given by 
Behnajady et al. (2008 ) was followed . In the photodeposition method, Ag metal 
doped on TiO 2 was prepared by photo reducing Ag+ ions to Ag metal on the TiO 2

The pH of the TiO 2 suspen sion was adjusted to 3, by addition of perchloric acid. 
Then, 3.923 g of AgNO 3 for doping was added to the TiO 2 suspension such that Ag to 
Ti ratio on molar basis was 1:1.7 as per the requirement. The mixture was then 
irradiated with UV light (36 W) for 3 h and then dried in a hot air oven at 100 oC for 
12 h. The dried solids were ground in an agate mortar and calcined at 450 oC for 3 h 
in a muffle furnace.  
 
3.5 Characterization of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles  
 
In order to be able to tailor the properties of any engineered nanoparticles, careful 
investigation of the produced particles is crucial. If characterization is performed on 
the nanoparticles, it is easy to determine what improvement in the properties of 
nanoparticles has been brought about and how these ch anges contribute to targeted 
application. In the current study characterization was essential to determine the size 
and shape of the nanoparticles, to ensure the formation of core -shell structure, to 
determine the composition, crystallinity, band gap energ y, thermal stability  and light 
absorption characteristics. Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized were characterized 
using various well documented techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy 
(TEM), Selected Area Electron diffraction (SAED), Energy Disp ersive Spectra 
(EDS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X -Ray diffraction (XRD), Thermo 
gravimetric -differential thermal analysis (TG -DTA), Diffuse Reflectance Spectra 
(DRS) and Brunauer -Emmett -Teller (BET) surface area analysis. Knowledge on these 
characteri stics has helped in understanding the photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles.  
 
3.5.1.  Transmission Electron Microscopy  (TEM)  
 
TEM is a microscopic technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through 
an ultra -thin specimen, interacting with the specimen as it passes through. An image 
is formed from the interaction of the electrons transmitted through the specimen; the 
image is magnified and focused (Pradeep 2010). TEM analysis of Ag@TiO 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
98 
 nanoparticles was done to obtain information about morphology, composition and 
crystallography. The TEM, SAED and EDS measurements were performed with a 
JEOL -JEM -2100 F microscope operati ng at an acceleration potential of 200 kV. For 
TEM measurements, the sample was prepared by dispersing the colloids in ethanol by 
sonication, followed by drying on a carbon film.  
 
3.5.2  Atomic Force Microscopic (AFM) analysis   
  
For nearly 20 years, Scann ing Probe Microscopy (SPM) has been routinely employed 
as a surface characterization technique and AFM is the most widely used subset of 
SPM. AFM is ideally suited for characterization of nanoparticles, as it offers the 
capability of 3D visualization and b oth qualitative and quantitative information on 
many physical properties including size, morphology, surface texture and roughness. 
Statistical information, including size, surface area, and volume distributions, can be 
determined as well (Dror 1994). AFM consist sharp tip mounted on tiny cantilever 
spring attached with mechanical scanner which move over the surface to be 
characterized (Bonnell 2001). Surface height variation helps in variation of acting 
force on tip which further varies the bending of the cantilever. At the base of the 
cantilever spring, an integrated stress sensor measure bending which gets recorded in 
the electronic memory line by line (Bonnell 2001). AFM analysis of Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles was done to obtain information about morphology and particle size 
distribution. AFM  measurements and imaging were carried out using a scanning 
probe microscope (model: NT-MDT, NTEGRA ) and all the images were obtained in 
a contact mode. Softw are-based image processing of AFM data was done from groups 
of particle to generate quantitative information about particle size distribution. The 
statistics on groups of particles was carried out with image analysis and data 
processing which resulted in d etermination of particle size distribution of Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles.  
 
  MATERIALS AND METHODS

 3.5.3  X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis  
  
XRD is one of the powerful techniques for the characterization of nanoparticles. 
When X -rays interact with a crystalline substance (phase), di ffraction pattern is 
obtained. The X -ray diffraction pattern of a pure substance is like a fingerprint of the 
substance. The powder diffraction method is thus ideally suited for characterization 
and identification of polycrystalline phases. The main use of  powder diffraction is to 
identify components in a sample by a search/match procedure. Size of nanoparticles 
can also be determined using XRD. XRD analysis of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles was 
carried out to obtain information about crystalline structure and size.  In the case of 
materials where the core and the shell are crystalline, diffraction patterns from the 
prominent lattice planes can be seen in the diffractograms (Pradeep 2010). The X -ray 
diffractograms of the dried samples of Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles 
were obtained using JEOL X -ray Diffractometer (XRD); using CuK -alpha radiation 
(λ = 1.5425 Å, V = 40 KV, I = 20 mA) which allowed the determination of crystallite 
size of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. The average crystallite size was obtained using the 
Scherrer’s equation and is given by Eq.(3.1) (Spurr and Myers 1957; Harold and 
Leroy 1974)  
                                         (3.1)  
where D  is the crystallite size, k is the constant dependent on crystallite shape (0.89), 
λ is the X -ray wavelength, β is the FWHM (full width at half max) or integral breadth, 
θ is the Bragg’s angle, and β is the difference in angles at half max [(2 θ High) – (2θ 
Low)] (Spurr and Myers 1957; Klug and Alexander 1974).  
 
3.5.4 Thermo gravimetric -differential thermal analyzer (TG -DTA)  
 
TGA is an analytical technique used to determine a material’s thermal stability and its 
fraction of volatile components by monitoring the weight change that occurs, as a 
specimen is heated. The measurement is normally carried out in air or in an inert 
atmosphere and the weight is recorded as a function of increasing temperature. DTA 
is an analytical technique used to determine a material’s thermal stability and the 
energ y released or absorbed via chemical reactions during the heating process (Skoog MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
100 
 et al. 2003). In the present study, the weight changes in the catalyst were measured 
using thermo gravimetric -differential thermal analyzer (TG -DTA) (model: 6000 TG -
DTA 6300, E xstar, Japan) under nitrogen gas flow of 50 mL/min. The temperature 
was raised from room temperature to 600 ºC using a linear programmer at heating rate 
of 10 ºC/min. The sample weight was between 5 and 10 mg.   
 
3.5.5  Diffuse Reflectance Spectra (DRS) ana lysis and determination of band gap 
energy  
 
DRS is a frequently used technique for obtaining information about the optical 
properties of powder sample. The method utilizes spectral difference between incident 
and backscattered light intensity for quantifyi ng the underlying absorption and 
scattering processes that affects the light -medium interaction (Masuda et al. 2007). 
Optical absorption characterization of the Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles was done using 
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) (Varian Cary 5000 Spectrometer) within the 
wavelength range of 200 -800 nm . The incident beam is collimated, and reflected light 
is captured by an integrating sphere. To provide a nominal 100 % reflectance 
measurement, teflon reference was used. For diffuse reflectance measurement, the 
incident light is diffusely scattered on the surface of finely powdered sample and then 
scattered light is concentrated on reflectance sphere. Diffuse reflectance spectra  
provides information about the band gap energy of powder sample i.e. minimum 
energy required for an electron to be excited from va lance band to conduction band. 
Band gap measurement is very important for a photocatalyst. Band gap was calculated 
using Kubelka Munk’s model i.e.  a two -flux model which means, only diffused light 
is considered. Process for obtaining the band gap was based  on Tauc’s plot (Tauc et 
al. 1966; Tauc 1972; Davis and Mott 1970). Kubelka Munk’s transformation of 
measured reflectance was performed using Eq.(3.2).  
        
                     (3.2)  
where k is reflectance transformed according to Kubelka Munk and  R is the 
reflectance (%).  MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
101 
 The reflectance data were fitted to equations for both indirect Eq.(3.3)  and direct band 
gap transitions Eq.(3.4) , to find the type of band to band transition in Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles.  The indirect and direct band gap transitions  can be expressed by 
Kubelka –Munk’s model as follows:  
For indirect band gap transition (Reddy et al. 2002)  
                                (3.3)  
For direct band gap transition (Reddy et al. 2002)  
                              (3.4)  
Where   = Plank’s  constant = 6.626×10-34 J/s,    
  where c = Speed of light = 3×108 
m/s and λ= wavelength (nm= 10-9 m) 
The indirect and direct band gap equations were used to construct the plots.       
was plotted against the photon energy E g =    in eV for both direc t and indirect band 
gap transition. Then band gap of Ag@TiO 2 core-shell nanoparticles was calculated 
from linear portion of the plot by drawing tangent and the value associated with the 
intersection of the tangent to the plotted curve inflection point with  the horizontal axis 
gives the band gap energy (Tauc 1966).  The Tauc’s plot for transition mode which 
shows a perfect fit of corresponding equation and realistic values of band gap energy 
was considered. Based on the fit of the equation, the transition mod e was selected and 
corresponding band gap energy was obtained.  
 
3.5.6 Surface area analysis by Brunauer -Emmett -Teller (BET)  
 
BET analysis provides precise specific surface area evaluation of materials by 
nitrogen multilayer adsorption measured as a function of relative pressure using a 
fully automated analyser. The technique encompasses external area and pore area 
evaluations to determine the total specific surface area in m2/g yielding important 
information in studying the effects of surface porosit y and particle size in many 
applications. Surface area analysis of nanoparticles was carried out by BET method 
(Quanta chrome, USA). The sample weights used was 0.02 g.

 3.6. Preparation of aqueous dye solutions and analysis of the dyes  
 
3.6.1. Preparat ion of aqueous dye solutions  
  
Aqueous dye solutions at the required concentrations were prepared by dissolving 
appropriate quantity (considering the purity) of the dyes in 100 mL distilled water. 
For example,  100 mg/L of AY -17 dye solution was prepared b y dissolving 0.0166 g 
of AY -17 (purity 60 %)  in 100 mL of distilled water and 100 mg/L of RB -220 
solution was prepared by dissolving 0.011 g of RB -220 (90 % pure)  in 100 mL of 
distilled water.  
 
3.6.2. Analysis of dyes  
 
The dye concentrations in the aqueous samples were analyzed by measurement of the 
absorbance of the solutions at the corresponding wavelengths (at 418 nm for AY -17 
and at 609 nm for RB -220) using Hitachi UV -160A spectrophotometer and then by 
obtaining the corresponding concentration fr om the calibration equation. The 
procedure for calibration of the spectrophotometer, calibration data and calibration 
plot with the corresponding calibration equation for both the dyes are presented in 
Appendix I. Whenever the concentrations of the samples  were beyond the calibration 
concentration limits, the samples were suitably diluted before the measurement of 
absorbance and the concentration obtained from the calibration equation were 
multiplied by the dilution factors.  
 
3.7. Photocatalysis experiments   
  
Batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted to study the efficacy of the 
nanoparticles as photocatalysts both under UV and solar light irradiation. Core -shell 
structured Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were used as photocatalysts for the degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 dyes. The efficacy of these nanoparticles was also compared with 
commercial Degussa -P25 catalyst and other synthesized TiO 2 and Ag doped TiO 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
103 
 nanoparticles. The experimental  set up used for these experiments and the 
experimental procedures are explained in the following sections.  
 
3.7.1. Experimental setup  
 
The experimental setup for UV photocatalysis is shown in Figure 3.2. It consisted of 
an aluminium chamber of 40 cm × 70 cm × 70 cm dimensions equipped with two 
numbers of 18 W UV lamps ( wavelength, λ = 365 nm,  Philips), placed vertically as 
shown in Figure 3.2. The UV lamps are placed 22 cm apart. The lamps are specified 
to radiate 80 % UV -A and 20 % UV -B light. A borosilic ate glass reactor was placed 
equidistant from both the UV lamps. The reaction mixture in the reactor was 
magnetically stirred. Air was continuously bubbled through the reactor contents, at a 
flow rate of 2 LPM. Figure 3.3 shows the photographic image of th e experimental UV 
photocatalytic reactor set up used in the current study. Light intensity was measured 
using a UV light intensity meter (model: UV -340A, Lutron) and an average light 
intensity of 5.85 mW/cm2 was found at the reactor walls. To maintain a co nstant 
temperature in the reactor, an exhaust fan was fitted on top of the chamber to drive 
out the heated air. The temperature of the reaction mixture during the entire 
irradiation period of 360 min was 31.5 ± 1.5° C for UV photocatalysis.  
 Similar reacto r was used for experiments on solar photocatalysis (Figure 3.4) 
and experiments were done in an open terrace between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. 
Figure 3.5 shows the photographic image of the reactor used for solar photocatalysis. 
The reaction mixture was mag netically stirred. The intensity of solar light was 
measured using UV light intensity meter (UV -340A, Lutron) and lux meter (KM -
LUX -100K) respectively for UV and visible light intensity. The temperature of the 
reaction mixture was measured and found to be 33 ± 3 °C during the entire irradiation 
period of 360 min.  
 To study the effect of light intensity, an immersion well photochemical reactor 
(Figure 3.6) supplied by Scientific Aids and Instruments Corporation, Chennai, India 
was used. It consists of a doub le walled immersion well made of quartz (IWQ1), 
which houses the lamp. Inlet and outlet tubes are provided into the annular space 
between the double walls of the immersion well for circulation of water for cooling. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
104 
 The immersion well is placed inside a bor osilicate cylindrical reaction flask of 150 
mL volume (Model A/150), with flattened bottom for placing the magnetic stirring 
bead. It is provided with one angle socket and one vertical socket made of glass. The 
reaction mixture containing the dye solution and the catalyst was placed in the 
reaction flask and continuously stirred with magnetic stirrer. Cooling water was 
circulated through the annular space in immersion well. Tubing for air supply was 
inserted into the reaction flask through one of the socket s on the wall of the reaction 
flask. Samples from reaction mixture were withdrawn using a peristaltic pump 
through a tube inserted into another socket on the reaction flask wall. Figure 3.7 
shows the photographic image of the immersion well photoreactor. T he reactor 
content was irradiated with 80 or 125 W medium pressure mercury vapor lamps that 
radiate pre -dominantly 365 -366 nm radiation with smaller amounts in the wavelength 
of 265, 297, 303, 313 nm, as well as small amounts in the visible region. The lam ps 
are housed inside the immersion well. The immersion well photoreactor was housed 
in an aluminium chamber so as to protect the personnel from UV radiations and to 
avoid radiation loss.

3.8 Experimentation  
 
3.8.1 Photocatalysis experiments in batch stirred reactor  
 
Batch photocatalytic degradation experiments were performed in a batch stirred 
reactor for photocatalytic degradation of the dyes with Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured 
nanoparticles or other photoca talysts, as per requirement of the experimental studies 
under UV or solar light irradiation. In all the experiments 100 mL aqueous dye 
solution with the required concentration of the dye, containing appropriate quantity of 
the photocatalyst was used. Initi al pH of the solution was adjusted to a required value 
by adding 0.01 N NaOH or 0.01 N H 2SO 4 and by measuring the pH with a pH meter 
(Equip -Tronics model no.EQ -610). Aqueous dye solutions were magnetically stirred. 
In the absence of other oxidants, air was  bubbled through the reaction mixture 
continuously at a flow rate of 2 LPM for UV photocatalysis. For experiments with 
other oxidants, appropriate quantities of oxidants (H 2O2, (NH 4)2S2O8, KBrO 3) were 
added to the reaction mixture. In experiments for solar photocatalysis, where these 
oxidants were not used, only the dissolved oxygen present in the reaction mixture 
acted as the oxidant. No additional air supply was provided for solar photocatalysi s. 
At regular time intervals, 3 mL of the samples were withdrawn and centrifuged at 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
108 
 10000 rpm for 5 min to separate the catalyst. The absorbance of the dye solution at 
λmax (418 nm for AY -17 and 609 nm for RB -220) was measured by a UV –Vis 
spectrophotometer  (Hitachi model no.U -2000) and corresponding dye concentration 
in the solution was measured. The percentage of degradation of the dye was 
calculated by using Eq.(3.5)  
                    
                      (3.5)  
where C 0 is the initial dye c oncentration and C is the dye concentration in the reactor 
at any time. All the experiments were performed in triplicates, and at each sampling 
time, average values are reported.   
Various experimental studies were conducted in batch stirred reactor and ar e listed 
below.  
(i) Batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles 
synthesized with different Ag to Ti molar ratio followed by calcination at different 
temperatures. The experiments were conducted for the degradation of both AY -17 and 
RB-220 using  Ag@TiO 2 synthesized with  varying Ag to Ti molar ratio range of  1:5, 
1:3.1, 1:2.2, 1:1.7,1:0.8, calcined at  temperature range of 150 -550 ºC for 3 h under

temperature on photocatalytic degradation was studied. These experimental results 
were also analyzed to select optimum Ag to Ti molar ratio and calcination 
temperature based on maximum degradation of the dyes.  
(ii) Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized wit h optimum Ag to Ti molar ratio 
(1:1.7) and calcined at optimum temperature for different calcination times ranging 
from 1 -5 h. Batch photocatalysis experiments under UV and solar light irradiation

 photocatalysis, initial dye concentration=50 mg/L. These experiments were conducted 
to select optimum calcination time and the optimum values were selected, based on 
maximum degradation of the dyes.  
(iii)  Batch experiments were then conducted in order to confirm that the removal of 
AY-17 and RB -220 from contaminated water, in the presence of light and Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles is due to photocatalysis. Batch experimen ts were conducted for removal 
of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes (a) under UV or solar light irradiation and in the absence 
of the catalyst, (b) under dark conditions with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles, and (c) with 
Ag@TiO 2 under UV and solar light irradiations. In all the experiments 100 mL of dye 
solution was used. Experiments were conducted at following conditions under UV 
and solar light irradiation (a) for AY -17: pH=3, initial dye concentration=10 mg/L

dark.  
(iv) Further batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted under UV and sola r 
light irradiation, with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized with optimum Ag to Ti 
molar ratio and calcined at optimum temperature for optimum period of time. 
Experiments were also conducted with commercial TiO 2 (Degussa P25) and other 
catalysts such as SGT iO2, CSTiO 2, Ag doped -SGTiO 2, Ag doped (LI) -CSTiO 2 and 
Ag doped (PD) -CSTiO 2. Ag doped TiO 2 nanoparticles used in these experiments were 
synthesized with optimum Ag to Ti molar ratio chosen for Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles 
and were calcined at 450 ºC for 3h. Conditions used for these experiments were:  (a) 
for AY -17 dye: initial pH=3, catalyst loading=100 mg/L, initial dye concentration=10 
mg/L. (b) for RB -220 dye: initial pH=3, catalyst loading=1 g/L for UV p hotocatalysis 
and 500 mg/L for solar photocatalysis, initial dye concentration=50 mg/L. The 
photocatalytic activity of these nanoparticles in terms of photocatalytic degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 dyes was compared with that of Ag@TiO 2 core shell structur ed 
nanoparticles by UV and solar photocatalysis.  
(v) Batch photocatalysis experiments were then conducted with Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles synthesized with optimum Ag to Ti molar ratio and calcined at optimum 
temperature for optimum period of time, to study the effect of pH ranging from 1 -9 MATERIALS AND METHODS

photocatalysis, initial dye concentration=50 mg/L. These experiments were conducted 
to select the optimum pH and the optimum values were selected based on maximum 
degradation of the dyes. Batch photocatalysis experiments were also conducted at 
different pH under the light source (UV or solar) and in the absence of catalyst  in 
order to confirm the sole effect of pH on the degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes. 
Optimum pH was chosen based on ‘one factor at a time’ analysis.  
(vi) Batch photocatalysis experiments were then conducted with Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles synthesized with optimum Ag to Ti molar ratio and calcined at optimum 
temperature for optimum pe riod of time, to study the effect of catalyst loading ranging 
from 50 -1000 mg/L for UV and 50 -500 mg/L for solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and 
500-2000 mg/L for UV and 250 -2000 mg/L for solar photocatalysis of RB -220. 
Experiments were conducted at optimized pH values for both the dyes. The conditions 
used for these studies were: (a) for AY -17 dye:  initial pH=3, initial dye 
concentration=10 mg/L. (b) for RB -220 dye: initial pH=3, initial dye 
concentration=50 mg/L. These experiments were conducted to select th e optimum 
catalyst loading and the optimum values were selected, based on maximum 
degradation of the dyes. Optimum catalyst loading was chosen based on ‘one factor at 
a time’ analysis. Optimum dye to catalyst ratio was selected based on optimum 
catalyst lo ading obtained.  
(vii) Batch photocatalysis experiments were also conducted by varying the dye 
concentration and catalyst loading individually, while keeping the dye to catalyst ratio 
constant, to study whether, initial dye concentration acts as an indepen dent parameter 
affecting the degradation. Initial dye concentration was varied from 10 -200 mg/L for 
UV and 10 -500 mg/L for solar photocatalysis of AY -17; 50 -200 mg/L for UV and 50 -
500 mg/L for solar photocatalysis of RB -220. Experiments were conducted by 
keeping dye to catalyst ratio constant at 1:30 (g/g) for UV and 1:10 (g/g) for solar 
photocatalysis of AY -17 and 1:20 (g/g) for UV and 1:10 (g/g) for solar photocatalysis 
of RB -220. Initial pH was adjusted to 3. These experiments were conducted to select MATERIALS AND METHODS

maximum degradation of the dyes.  
(viii) Batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted with different oxidants such 
as H2O2, (NH 4)2S2O8 and KBrO 3 under UV and solar light irradiatio n at the following 
conditions: (a) for AY -17 dye:  pH=3, initial dye concentration= 100 mg/L, optimum 
dye to catalyst ratio=1:30 (g/g)(from one factor at a time analysis) for UV 
photocatalysis and pH=3, initial dye concentration= 100 mg/L, optimum dye to 
catalyst ratio=1:10 (g/g) (from one factor at a time analysis) for solar photocatalysis

mg/L, dye to catalyst ratio=1:10 (g/g) for solar photocatalysis. These experiments 
were conducted with oxidants in the following concentration range: H 2O2 (5 to 20 
mM), (NH 4)2S2O8 (1 to 4 g/L) and KBrO 3 (1 to 4 g/L) for UV and solar photocatalysis 
of AY -17 and H 2O2 (10 to 40 mM), (NH 4)2S2O8 (0.5 to 2.5 g/L) for UV and solar, 
KBrO 3 (2 to 6 g/L) for UV and KBrO 3 (1 to 4 g/L) for solar photocatalysis of RB -220. 
Batch photocatalysis experiments were also conducted at different concentrations of 
oxidants under the light s ource (UV or solar) and in the absence of catalyst  in order to 
confirm the sole effect of oxidants ( H2O2, (NH 4)2S2O8, and KBrO 3) on the 
degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes. Effect of concentrations of each of the 
oxidants on photocatalytic degradation of the dyes was studied and optimum 
concentration of each of the oxidants was obtained. Then the degradation of the dyes 
with optimum concentration of different oxidants were compared. Based on these 
studies, the best oxidant among those studied in the curren t work, was chosen.  
 Optimum values of pH, optimum dye to catalyst ratio and optimum oxidant 
concentration were thus obtained by crude optimization method based on ‘One factor 
at a time’ set of experimental results. The range of pH,  catalyst loading and o xidant 
concentration for RSM based optimization studies were also chosen based on these 
initial set of ‘One factor at a time’ experimental result analysis.  
(ix) Batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted under UV and solar light to 
check the feasibility of reuse of Ag@TiO 2 catalyst for repeated photocatalysis. In all 
the experiments 100 mL of dye solution was used. Experiments were conducted under 
following conditions (a) for AY -17: pH=3, catalyst loading=1.5 g/L, initial dye MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
112 
 concentration=50 mg/L for UV photocatalysis and pH=3, catalyst loading=1 g/L, 
initial dye concentration=100 mg/L for solar photocatalysis (b) for RB -220 dye: 
pH=3, catalyst loading=1g/L, initial dye concentration=50 mg/L for UV and pH=3, 
catalyst loading=500 mg/L, initial dye concentration=50 mg/L for solar 
photocatalysis. After performing an experiment with freshly prepared catalyst, it was 
reused thrice for further experiments. The regeneration of catalyst for the next cycle 
was done by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10  min to separate the particles from the 
reaction mixture and then by suspending the separated particles in ethanol for 
washing. The particles were further separated from ethanol by centrifugation. The 
process of ethanol washing and centrifugation was repea ted thrice. To remove ethanol 
from the particles after centrifugation, the particles were dried in an oven at 100 0C 
for 2 h. These particles were then used for next cycle of batch experiment. Same 
experimental conditions were used for all the four cycles (with fresh catalyst and for 
three cycles of reuse).  
 
3.9 Optimization of factors affecting the degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes  
 
3.9.1 Optimization of conditions for photocatalytic process  
 
The methodical optimization of factors affecting the photoc atalytic process namely, 
pH, catalyst loading and the oxidant concentration were carried out by conducting 
batch experiments under UV and solar light radiation, in accordance with the 
experiments designed as per Design of Experiments (DOE) strategy. The ox idant 
which yielded maximum degradation and highest rate of degradation of the dyes 
during the initial set of experiments (One factor at a time) conducted to screen a 
suitable oxidant was selected for optimization. The selected factors  for optimization 
were pH (X 1), catalyst loading (X 2) and the oxidant concentration (X 3). These three 
factors were chosen at five different levels. The selected oxidant was ammonium 
persulfate for degradation of both the dyes. Experiments were designed as per Central 
Composite  Design (CCD). DOE based on CCD needed twenty experimental runs with 
three factors and five levels. Twenty sets of experimental conditions obtained through 
CCD are presented in Table 3.4 and Table 3.5 respectively for UV and solar MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
113 
 photocatalysis of AY -17 a nd RB -220 dyes. Twenty sets of batch photocatalysis 
experiments were conducted for each of the dyes and both under UV and solar light 
irradiation. For statistical calculations, the variables Xi were coded as    according to 
the following relationship:  
        
                     (3.6)  
where X0 is the value of Xi at the center point and δX  represents the step change 
(Khatee et al. 2009) .     is the coded factor for the actual value of the factor Xi 
(Uncoded). Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 show the var ious levels of pH, catalyst loading 
and ammonium persulfate concentration used for design of experiments for UV and 
solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes respectively in coded (   ) and 
uncoded ( Xi) form. Batch experimental trials were conducted a s described in Section 
3.8.1, at experimental conditions specified by the experimental design matrix through 
CCD, which is presented in terms of coded and uncoded levels in Table 3.5 and Table 
3.6 for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes re spectively.  In all 
the experiments, initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L was used. Concentration of the 
dye (AY -17 or RB -220) was measured by spectrophotometric analysis as described in 
Section 3.8.1. Percentage degradation of AY -17 dye obtained at the e nd of 15 min for 
UV and solar photocatalysis were subjected to analysis using Response Surface 
Methodology (RSM).  Percentage degradation of RB -220 dye obtained at the end of 
20 min for UV photocatalysis and 10 min for solar photocatalysis were subjected t o 
analysis using RSM.  
 
3.9.2 Multiple regression analysis and optimization using RSM  
 
The results of the experiments conducted under conditions based on Central 
Composite design set were analyzed using RSM. The effects of three factors (pH, 
catalyst loadi ng and ammonium persulfate concentration) as individuals and in 
combination with interacting effect on the response [% degradation of AY -17 or RB -
220] were evaluated using RSM.  Multiple regression analysis (MRA) on the 
experimental input -output data was p erformed using MINITAB 14 software. The 
results were fitted into the regression equation and the effects of factors on the 
response were analyzed by RSM. The analysis included the linear and quadratic MATERIALS AND METHODS

 effects of the three factors and their interactions. Th us, the equations giving 
percentage degradation of the dyes as a function of the factors fitted onto second -
order polynomial model with 10 coefficients ( b0,b1, b12 …… b 23), is presented in 
Eq.(3.7).

coefficients were estimated using MRA with MINITAB 14 soft ware. The significance 
of the terms in the model were evaluated by using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
based upon the F-test with unequal variance (P<0.05) (Liu et al.  2005a). The optimum 
values of the pH, catalyst loading, and ammonium persulfate concentra tion were 
obtained by using response optimizer of MINITAB 14 for UV and solar 
photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes.

 3.9.3 Experiments at optimized conditions  
 
Batch experiments were conducted at RSM based methodical optimized values of 
initial pH, catalyst loading and ammonium persulfate concentration. The optimum 
values obtained from the response optimizer of MINI TAB 14 were used to verify the 
effectiveness of DOE and optimization strategy, as well as to validate the regression 
equation. Dye solution of 100 mg/L was prepared. Catalyst and ammonium 
persulphate were added such that their optimum concentrations were o btained.  Initial 
pH was adjusted to the optimum value.  Batch experiments were conducted under 
optimized conditions for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes.  
The percentage degradation obtained from the model and by experiments was 
compare d to validate the model. The percentage degradations obtained under RSM 
based methodically optimized conditions were compared with those obtained under 
crude optimized conditions by “one factor at a time’ analysis, to determine the 
effectiveness of RSM bas ed optimization strategy.  
 
3.10 Experiments to study effect of initial dye concentration  
 
The effect of initial concentration on photocatalytic degradation of dyes was studied, 
as it is important from both mechanistic and application point of view. Batch 
photocatalysis experiments were carried out in a batch stirred reactor to study the 
effect of initial dye concentration on degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes using 
Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured nanoparticles as the photocatalyst under UV and solar 
light irradiation. In all the experiments 100 mL aqueous dye solution in water was 
used and experiments were done at RSM based methodically optimized conditions. 
The effect of ini tial concentration of AY -17 on the UV and solar photocatalytic 
degradation was investigated over the concentration range from 100 mg/L to 700 
mg/L. For RB -220, effect of initial concentration was investigated over the 
concentration range from 100 mg/L to 5 00 mg/L for UV and 100 mg/L to 700 mg/L 
for solar photocatalytic degradation. The experiments were conducted by keeping the 
catalyst loading at the optimum obtained for 100 mg/L dye concentration. So when 
the initial dye concentration was varied, the dye t o catalyst ratio also varied. Samples MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
119 
 were withdrawn at regular intervals of time and analyzed for dye concentrations using 
UV–Vis spectrophotometer as described in Section 3.8.1 and percentage degradation 
were calculated.  
 
3.11 Experiments to study the ef fect of light intensity  
 
3.11.1 Batch experiments in immersion well reactor to study the effect of light 
intensity on UV photocatalysis  
 
Batch photocatalysis experiments were carried out in an immersion well reactor 
shown in Figure3.6 to study the effect o f light intensity on photocatalysis of AY -17 
and RB -220 dyes using Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured nanoparticles as a 
photocatalyst under UV light irradiation. In all the experiments, 100 mL dye solution 
was used. The experiments were conducted for AY -17 dye  degradation under the 
following experimental conditions: initial pH=3, catalyst loading= 3 g/L, initial dye 
concentration= 100 mg/L. Experiments were also conducted for RB -220 dye 
degradation under the following conditions: initial pH=3, catalyst loading=  2 g/L, 
initial dye concentration= 100 mg/L. Experiments were conducted with continuous 
supply of air into the reactor, which served as a source of oxidant. Experiments were 
conducted at two different light intensities provided by irradiation with 80 W or 125 
W medium pressure Hg lamps.  The UV light intensities with 80 W and 125 W lamps 
on the reactor wall surface were 11.2 and 13.5 mW/cm2 respectively as measured by 
UV light intensity meter (UV -340A, Lutron).  Air was bubbled through the reaction 
mixture continuously at a flow rate of 2 LPM. Aqueous dye solutions were 
magnetically stirred. The temperature of the reaction mixture during the entire 
irradiation period remained almost constant due to continuous water circulation 
around the lamps. At regular ti me intervals, 3 mL of the samples were withdrawn 
using peristaltic pump and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 min to separate the catalyst. 
Concentration of the dye (AY -17 or RB -220) was measured by spectrophotometric 
analysis as described in Section 3.8.1.  
 MATERIALS AND METHODS

 3.11.2 Batch experiments in stirred reactor to study the effect of light intensity 
on solar photocatalysis  
 
Batch photocatalysis experiments were carried out in stirred reactor to study the effect 
of light intensity on solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes using Ag@TiO 2 
core shell structured nanoparticles as a photocatalyst on a sunny day, semi cloudy day 
and a cloudy day. The UV and visible light intensities were measured on the reactor 
walls at regular time periods during the experimental runs and  at four different 
locations on the reactor walls, using UV intensity meter (UV -340A, Lutron) and lux 
meter (KM -LUX -100K) respectively. The light intensities were averaged over 
different locations on the reactor walls and over different time periods of exp erimental 
run.  Three experiments were performed at different conditions of illumination; on a 
full sunny day (clear sky), on a semi cloudy day, and on full cloudy day. In all the 
experiments 100 mL aqueous dye solution was used. The experiments were condu cted 
for AY -17 and RB -220 dye degradation under the following experimental conditions: 
initial pH=3, catalyst loading= 1 g/L, initial dye concentration= 100 mg/L, oxidant 
used= atmospheric air, average UV and visible light intensities on a full sunny, semi  
and full cloudy day  were 3.56, 2.65 and 1.25 mW/cm2 (UV) respectively and 13×104, 
92×103 and 45×103 lux (visible) respectively. At regular time intervals, samples were 
withdrawn and the concentration of the dye (AY -17 or RB -220) was measured by 
spectropho tometric analysis as described in Section 3.8.1.  
 
3.12 Effect of presence of salts on UV and solar photocatalytic degradation of 
dyes   
 
Batch photocatalysis experiments were carried out in a batch stirred reactor to study 
the effect of salts such as NaCl, and Na 2CO 3 present in dye contaminated water, on 
degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes using Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured 
nanoparticles as the photocatalyst under UV and solar light irradiation. All the 
experiments were performed under RSM based methodical ly optimized conditions. 
Samples were withdrawn at regular intervals of time and analyzed for dye 
concentrations using UV –Vis spectrophotometer as described in Section 3.8.1.  MATERIALS AND METHODS

 3.13 Mineralization of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes  
 
To study the extent of mineraliza tion of the dyes by UV and solar photocatalysis, 
batch experiments were conducted in a batch stirred reactor under RSM based 
methodically optimized conditions. Samples withdrawn from the reactor at various 
intervals of time were analyzed for COD, TOC, nitr ate concentration, nitrite 
concentration, chloride concentration and sulphate concentration. The protocols for 
these analyses are presented in the following sub sections.  
 
3.13.1  Determination of Chemical Oxygen Demand in aqueous dye solutions  
 
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) measures the oxygen requirement equivalent of 
organic matter that is susceptible to oxidation with the help of a strong chemical 
oxidant. It is important, rapidly measured parameter as a means of measuring organic 
strength for streams and poll uted water bodies. Measurement of COD was done with 
standard reflux method (APHA 1995). 0.4 g of mercuric sulphate (HgSO 4), 20 mL of 
sample or an aliquot of sample diluted to 20 mL with distilled water and 10 mL of 
0.25 N potassium dichromate ( K2Cr2O7) solution was added to reflux flask and mixed 
well. 30 mL of concentrated sulphuric acid was added slowly to reflux flask and 
mixed properly. Then reflux flask was placed in a COD -digester and refluxed for 
minimum of 2 h at 150 ºC. After 2 h , heating and reflu xing was stopped and solution 
was cooled to room temperature. The solution was then diluted to about twice its 
volume with distilled water and titrated against ferrous ammonium sulphate (FAS) 
with ferroin as the indicator. The sharp colour change observed from blue green to 
reddish brown indicates the endpoint or completion of the titration. Volume of FAS 
added was noted and titration was repeated three times to get concordant readings. 
Blank sample was prepared in similar way by substituting sample with di stilled water 
and volume of FAS consumed for blank sample was also analyzed in the similar 
manner. COD was determined using Eq.(3.8).  MATERIALS AND METHODS

Where, a= mL of FAS used for blank, b=  mL of FAS used for sample, N= Normality 
of FAS.     
 
3.13.2  Determination of Total Organic Carbon in aqueous dye solutions  
 
Total Organic Carbon (TOC)  measurement is the standard method for the evaluation 
of organic matter content in domestic and industrial wastes, as well as in surface and 
ground waters. The amount of organic matter present in water is an important 
criterion for its quality. TOC measur ement was carried out with  Shimadzu TOC -VCSH 
Carbon Analyzer.   
 
3.13.3  Estimation of nitrate in aqueous dye solutions  
 
In organic pollutants, nitrate ions are important indicators of pollution, as nitrogen 
from dye molecules often decompose as nitrate ions (APHA  1995). Estimation of 
nitrate ion was carried out with spectroscopic method (APHA 1995). 25 mL of sample 
and 1 mL of 2N hydrochloric acid (HCl) were added to 100 mL standard flask and 
solution was made upto the mark with distilled water.  Blank sample was p repared in 
similar way by substituting sample with distilled water. Absorbance of the solution 
was measured at 220 nm using Hitachi U2000 model spectrophotometer against blank 
and the nitrate concentration was measured using the calibration equation. Calib ration 
plot and calibration equation for nitrate ion analysis along with the detailed procedure 
of calibration is given in Appendix II.  
 
3.13.4  Estimation of nitrite in aqueous dye solutions  
 
For the determination of nitrite ion in surface water, sea water and wastewater, 
spectrophotometric method is the most useful (ISSO 6777:1984). It is based on the 
reaction of nitrite ions with sulfanilamide  which result in formation of diazo 
compound. This compound further react with naphthylethylenediamine ( NEDA)  MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
123 
 yielding a red colour (ISSO 6777:1984). Estimation of nitrite ion was carried out with 
spectrophotometric method (ISSO 6777:1984). 50 mL of clear sample and 1mL of 
sulfanilamide solution was added to 100 mL standard flask and made upto the mark 
with distilled water . After 2 -8 min, 1.0 mL of NEDA solution was added and mixed. 
Blank sample was prepared in similar way by substituting sample with distilled water. 
Absorbance of the solution against blank was measured at 540 nm using Hitachi 
U2000 model spectrophotometer and the nitrite concentration was measured using the 
calibration equation. Calibration plot and calibration equation for nitrite ion analysis 
along with the detailed procedure of calibration is given in Appendix III.  
 
3.13.5  Estimation of sulphate in aqueo us dye solutions  
 
For the determination of sulphate ion in surface water, sea water and wastewater, 
turbidimetric method is the most useful (APHA 1995). In this method sulphate ion is 
precipitated in acidic medium with barium chloride and as a result barium  sulphate 
crystals are formed. The absorbance is then measured by spectrophotometer and 
sulphate ion  concentration is determined by comparison of reading with standard

turbidimetric  method (APHA 1995). 75 g of NaCl, 30 mL of concentrated HCl and 
100 mL of 95% ethyl alcohol were added to 300 mL of distilled water. Then 50 mL of 
glycerol was added to the above solution and mixed well. 25 mL of sample, 10 mL of 
the above sol ution and 10 mL of 10 % BaCl 2 solution were added to 100 mL standard 
flask and solution was made upto the mark with distilled water.  Blank sample was 
prepared in the similar way by substituting the sample with distilled water. 
Absorbance of the solution wa s measured at 420 nm using Hitachi U2000 model 
spectrophotometer and the sulphate ion concentration was measured using the 
calibration equation. Calibration plot for sulphate ion along with the detailed

 3.13.6 Estimation of chloride in aqueous dye solutions  
 
Chloride ion in water and wastewater is one of the major inorganic anions. The 
amount of chloride present in water can be easily determined by titrating with silver 
nitrate solution which easily reacts with chloride and as a result, red silver chromate is 
formed (APHA 1995). In the current study, the estimation of chloride  ion was carried 
out with the APHA standard method (APHA 1995). 50 mL of the sample was taken in 
a conical flask and 2 -3 drops of potassium chromate indicator was added into the flask 
to get yellow colour and the solution was titrated against silver nitrate solution until 
the colour changed from yellow to brick red.  Volume of silver nitrate added was 
noted and titration was repeated three times to get concordant readings. Blank sample 
was p repared in the similar way by substituting sample with distilled water. Chloride 
concentration was determined using Eq.(3.9).

3.14 Treatment of mixture of dyes in contaminated water  
  
Batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted under UV and s olar light irradiation 
and degradation of each of the dyes in mixed dye solution was studied. These 
experiments were carried out in a batch stirred reactor for photocatalysis of mixture of 
dyes in aqueous solution using Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured nanopa rticles as the 
photocatalyst. Experiments were conducted with 100 mL of the aqueous dye solution 
and with the dye concentration combination specified in Table 3.7. All the 
experiments for the treatment of mixture of dyes were conducted under RSM based 
meth odically optimized conditions obtained for both AY -17 and RB -220 dye 
degradation, in order to check the applicability of optimized conditions for 
degradation of one of the dyes, to degradation of both the dyes simultaneously in 
mixed dye solution. Concentr ations of the dyes (AY -17 or RB -220) were measured at 
regular time intervals by spectrophotometric analysis as described in Section 3.15.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
125 
 Percentage degradation was then determined for each of the dyes in a mixed dye 
solution and compared with that in si ngle dye solution.

3.14.1 Preparation of mixture of dye stock solution  
 
The stock solutions of 1000 mg/L concentration of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes were 
prepared separately. The aqueous solutions of mixture of the dyes containing desired 
combinations of AY -17 and RB-220 were prepared by mixing the required volumes 
of the stock solutions and diluting the mixture suitably with distilled water.  
 
3.14.2 Analysis of mixture of dyes (AY -17 and RB -220) solution  
 
When a mixture of two or more dyes are present in water, the re may be a possibility 
of physical and chemical bond formation between them, which causes interference in 
analysis of the dyes. In such cases, the wavelengths used for absorbance measurement 
for single dyes using UV/Vis spectrophotometer, may not be suita ble for the analysis 
of single dyes in mixed dye solution. So, to study whether any interference of the dyes 
in mixture occurs during analysis, t he zero order absorption spectra of aqueous 
solutions of AY -17 (35 mg/L) and RB -220 (35 mg/L) individually and mixture of 
AY-17 and RB -220 (each 35 mg/L) were recorded using UV -Visible 
spectrophotometer (Hitachi UV -160A) and shown in Figure 3.8. It can be seen from 
Figure 3.8 that the λ max values of both the dyes (AY -17 and RB -220) do not change MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
126 
 with mixture of dye s and two different peaks for AY -17 and RB -220 dyes were 
observed. Figure 3.8 shows no overlapping of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes spectra and at 
the wavelength corresponding to the maximum absorbance for one dye, the 
absorbance due to other dye was nearly zero. The absorbance values for mixtures at 
λmax corresponding to AY -17 coincided with that for aqueous solution of AY -17. 
Similarly, the absorbance values for mixtures at λ max corresponding to RB -220 
coincided with that for aqueous solution of RB -220. So their concentrations in 
mixtures can be determined by direct absorbance measurement at their corresponding 
λmax. No overlapping of absorption spectra of single dye solutions with each other and 
overlapping of the mixture absorbance with the particular single dye  absorbance at its  
λmax or zero absorbance for the other dye at this λ max, indicates that both the dyes 
(AY-17 and RB -220) are not linked with physical or chemical bond and hence no 
interference effects were observed. So in the study on the degradation of  each of the 
dyes in aqueous mixed dye solution of AY -17 and RB -220, the absorbance was 
measured at their corresponding λ max values of 418 and 609 nm respectively. 
Concentrations were then measured using the corresponding calibration plots shown 
in Appendi x V.

 3.15 Determination of colour in Hazen unit  
 
Batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted with single and mixed dye 
solutions at optimized conditions for each of the dyes. Samples withdrawn at different 
intervals of time and those before treatment were analyzed for colour in terms of 
Hazen unit. This method is based on the optical comparison of the liquid with a 
platinum cobalt reference solution. Today the Platinum/cobalt colour also named as 
APHA colour is one of the most common standards for the colour measurement of 
liquids.   
 
3.15.1 Preparatio n of a calibration standard stock solution with 500 mg/L Pt/Co 
(500 Hazen)  
 
Estimation of colour in terms of Hazen unit was carried out with spectroscopic 
method (APHA 1995). 1.245 g of potassium hexachloroplatinate and 1.0 g of cobalt 
(II) - chloride hexahydrate was dissolved in 100 mL of concentrated HCl.  The 
solution was further transferred to 1 L standard flask and diluted with distilled wa ter 
to make upto the mark.  Different standards of colour of 100, 200, 300 and 400 Hazen 
were prepared  by diluting 10, 20, 30 and 40 mL of stock colour standard with distilled 
water and by making upto the mark to 100 mL. The values of colour for AY -17 and 
RB-220 in standard solutions and treated solution were measured at 340 nm using 
Thermo Electron Corporation (Aquamate) model  spectrophotometer against distilled 
water blank.  Analysis of all samples for colour in terms of Hazen unit was done in 
BASF, India L td., Katipalla, Mangalore. Calibration plot for Hazen colour analysis is 
given in Appendix VI.  
 
3.16 Identification of intermediates by Liquid Chromatography -Mass 
Spectrophotometer (LC -MS) to propose the degradation pathway for the dyes  
 
To study the miner alization and mechanism of degradation of the dyes, the samples 
withdrawn from the reactor at various time periods during solar photocatalysis, were MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
128 
 subjected to Liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (LC -MS), to identify the 
intermediates and product s formed by photocatalysis of the dyes.  
 LC-MS (Thermo Surveyor) was used for the identification of intermediates 
and products formed during solar photocatalysis of the dyes. Aqueous samples 
collected after every 15 min, during photocatalysis experiments were analyzed by LC -
MS. For separation of intermediates, capillary column Terra C -18 and a mixture of 
acetonitrile –water (70/30, v/v) mobile phase was used. The flow rate was maintained 
at 0.08 mL min−1 and the injection volume was 20 μL. From the chromatographic 
column eluent consecutively enter the UV –Vis diode array detector, the Electrospray 
ionization  (ESI) interface and the quadruple ion trap mass analyzer. Mass 
spectrometer equipped with an ESI io n source was used to carry out MS analysis. The 
ESI probe tip and capillary potentials were set at 2.5 kV and 25 V, respectively and 
50–800 m/z was used. The mass -to-charge ratio of an ion is the unitless ratio of its 
mass number to the number of fundament al charges on the ion (Skoog et al. 2003). In 
mass spectrometer, most of the formed ions have single charge so m/z ratio is 
equivalent to exact mass (Skoog et al. 2003). When the charge of the formed ions is 
two then m/z ratio is equivalent to exact mass d ivided by two (Skoog et al. 2003). If 
peak of fragmented ions have m/z ratio greater then the exact mass, then that peak is 
attributed to the ions having the same chemical formula, but different isotopic 
compositions (Skoog et al. 2003).  So t he possible in termediates were identified 
manually based on their fragment ions mass to charge (m/z) ratio in the mass spectra. 
The chemical names of intermediate products of dyes formed during solar 
photocatalysis were found using Chem Draw Ultra 12 software.  
 
3.17 Pho tocatalysis with immobilized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles  
 
Batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted using Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles 
immobilized in chitosan beads or cellulose acetate film for the degradation of AY -17 
and RB -220 dyes under solar light irradiati on. Experiments were conducted with 100 
mL of the dye solution with initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L and under RSM 
based methodically optimized conditions. Optimum quantity of the catalyst 
nanoparticles were immobilized in chitosan beads and cellulose  acetate film using the MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
129 
 methods described in Section 3.17.1.1 and 3.17.1.2 respectively. These immobilized 
nanoparticles were used for batch photocatalysis in a batch stirred reactor. Samples 
were withdrawn at regular intervals of time and analyzed for dye  concentrations using 
UV –VIS spectrophotometer as described in Section 3.8.1 and percentage degradation 
was calculated.  
 
3.17.1. Immobilization of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles  
 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were immobilized in chitosan beads or in cellulose acetate 
films as described in the following sub sections.  
 
3.17.1.1. Immobilization of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles in chitosan beads  
 
Chitosan beads were prepared according to the method described by Wan Ngah et al. 
(2006) with a few modifications. The method used by Wan Ngah et al. (2006) for 
preparation of chitosan beads yielded beads with low strength. So in the present work, 
in order to increase the strength of chitosan beads, cross linking with gluteraldehyde 
was attempted (Singh et al. 2011b). Ag@TiO 2 loaded chitosan  beads were prepared 
according to the protocol explained below.  
 Chitosan solution was prepared by dissolving 2 g of chitosan flakes in 60 mL 
of 5% (v/v) acetic acid solution.  500 mL of 1 mol/L NaOH solution was prepared. 
Magnetic stirrer was used to diss olve the NaOH pellets; the solution was cooled to 
room temperature. 1mL gluteraldehyde was added to the NaOH solution.  Optimized 
amount (0.18 g for AY -17 and 0.1 g for RB -220 to yield 1.8 g/L and 1 g/L of 
optimum catalyst loading in the reactor) of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles (as obtained from 
RSM based optimized conditions) was added to the chitosan solution and was mixed 
well to obtain uniform solution. (Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were prepared with Ag to Ti 
molar ratio of 1:1.7 according to the procedure mentioned in section 3.2 and calcined 
at 450 ºC for 3 h). The viscous Chitosan­Ag@TiO 2 solution was added drop wise 
using syringe into precipitation bath containing NaOH solution. This ensures that the 
acetic acid within the chitosan gel is neutralized and there by coagulates the chitosan 
gel to spherical uniform chitosan gel bead. Gluteraldehyde which is present in the MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
130 
 NaOH solution acts as cross linking agent for chitosan and adds mechanical strength 
to the beads formed. The viscous solution was added slowly in ord er to obtain beads 
of uniform size and shape (average size of the beads were 3 mm as measured using 
vernier callipers).  The beads were left in the solution for about 3 h for hardening. The 
hardened beads were removed and washed with distilled water to remo ve NaOH 
residues.  Ag@TiO 2 immobilized in chitosan beads is hereinafter referred as Chitosan -
Ag@TiO 2 beads.  
 
3.17.1.2. Preparation of Cellulose Acetate­Ag@TiO 2 film 
 
Cellulose acetate films were prepared according to the solvent Casting Method (Wu et 
al. 20 05).  
 2 g of cellulose acetate solution in acetone was prepared. The solution was 
mixed well to obtain uniform solution. Optimized amount (0.18 g for AY -17 and 0.1 
g for RB -220 to yield 1.8 g/L and 1 g/L of optimum catalyst loading in the reactor) of 
Ag@T iO2 nanoparticles (as obtained from RSM based optimized conditions) was 
added to the Cellulose acetate - acetone solution. (Ag@TiO 2 particles were prepared 
with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 according to the procedure mentioned in Section 
3.2 and calcined at 450 ºC for 3 h). The mixture was stirred well using glass rod and 
was casted on clean and dry glass plate. The film was exposed to air for complete 
evaporation of Acetone for around 15 to 20 minutes. Once the acetone was 
evaporated, the film was peeled off slowly. The resulting film was cut into small 
flakes (approximately to 3mm×3mm square flakes) using scissors. Then these flakes 
were kept in oven for about 15­20 min at 60 °C for further drying. Cellulose acetate - 
Ag@TiO 2 flakes were stored in ethanol  until use. Ag@TiO 2 immobilized in cellulose 
acetate film is here in after referred as Cellulose Acetate­Ag@TiO 2 film.  
 
3.18 Batch experiments for degradation of other class of dyes  
 
Batch photocatalytic degradation experiments were performed in a batch stirred 
reactor for photocatalytic degradation of the other class of dyes with Ag@TiO 2 core 
shell structured nanoparticles under solar light irradiation. Batch experiments were MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
 
 
131 
 performed in order to check the photocatalytic efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticle s for 
the degradation of other dyes belonging to different classes, like: Basic Blue -41 (basic 
azo dye), Malachite Green (triarylmethane dye), Acid Blue -129 (anthraquinone dye), 
Congo red (diazo dye), Reactive Red -120 (reactive diazo dye), methyl orange (a cid 
azo dye), methyl red (acid azo dye), and methylene blue ( thi- azine dye) . In all the 
experiments 100 mL dye solution in water was used. The conditions used for these 
studies were: catalyst loading=100 mg/L, initial dye concentration=10 mg/L. 
Experiment s were done at different initial pH, depending upon the nature of dyes. For 
Malachite Green, Acid Blue -129, Congo red, Reactive Red -120, Methyl Orange and 
Methyl Red dyes experiments were done at initial pH=3 as all these dyes are acidic in 
nature and for Methylene Blue and Basic Blue -41 experiments were done at initial 
pH=9 as both of these dyes are basic in nature.

of this study, as well as other related research work reported in literature are also

4.1 Engineering Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles  by optimization of Ag to Ti molar ratio 
during synthesis, calcination temperature and calcination time for enhancement 
in UV and solar photocatalytic activity for degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 
dyes  
 
 In the present study, Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were synt hesized on the basis of 
one pot synthesis route reported by Hirakawa and Kamat (2005) with certain 
modification as described in Section 3.2. It is necessary to engineer the nanoparticles 
for better photocatalytic activity. It can be done by varying the com position of the 
nanoparticles, calcination temperature and calcination time. The current investigation 
focuses on engineering Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles by optimization of Ag to Ti molar 
ratio during the synthesis, calcination temperature and calcination time f or 
enhancement in UV and solar photocatalytic activity and hence its utilization as a 
photocatalyst in treatment of dye contaminated wastewater. Molar ratio of Ag to Ti 
may play an important role in the structure of the catalyst. Size of the core and shell  of 
Ag@TiO 2 depends on the molar ratio of Ag to Ti (Angkaew and Limsuwan 2012), 
which in turn may affect the photocatalytic activity. Calcination is important in 
shaping and in improving the activity of catalyst. It affects the efficiency of the 
photocatal yst. Calcination temperature and time affect the crystalline nature and size RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 of the catalyst. Enhancing calcination temperature improves the crystallization of 
photocatalyst (Wang et al. 2005; Kominami et al. 2003), which in turn helps in the 
improvement o f photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 (Ovenstone  2001; Yu et al. 2003). A 
better crystallization means the decrease of crystal defects, which are the 
recombination centers of photo -induced charge carriers (Yu et al. 2007a, b; Yu et al. 
2005; Mrowetz et al. 200 4; Jung and Park 2001 ; Liqang et al. 2006). It is well known 
from literature that calcination temperature not only influences the crystallinity, but 
also the morphology and surface area of the catalyst, which can clearly affect the 
photocatalytic activity (Sathish et al. 2007; Li et al. 2005). Calcination is a thermal 
treatment that also helps in the phase transformation. Phase transformation of TiO 2 
depends on the calcination temperature ( Zhang and Reller 2002 ). So the effect of 
calcination temperature and  the composition of the catalyst synthesis mixture as Ag to 
Ti molar ratio, on the photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 in terms of degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 dyes by UV and solar photocatalysis were studied. Ag@TiO 2 
catalysts were prepared with the Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:5, 1:3.1, 1:2.2, 1:1.7 and 
1:0.8 in the synthesis mixture. The synthesized catalysts were calcined at different 
temperatures ranging from 150 to 550 ºC for a time period of 3h and then evaluated 
for their photocatalytic activity unde r UV and solar light irradiation for degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 dyes.  
 
4.1.1 Effect of Ag to Ti molar ratio during synthesis and the calcination 
temperature of the catalyst on photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 in terms of 
photocatalytic degradation o f AY -17 under UV and solar light irradiation  
 
 To study the effect of Ag to Ti molar ratio during synthesis and the calcination 
temperature of the catalyst, on the degradation of AY -17, batch photocatalysis 
experiments were carried out under UV and solar l ight irradiations in stirred reactor at 
initial concentration of 10 mg/L of the dye in aqueous solution with an initial pH of 
3.Experiments were conducted with Ag@TiO 2 catalysts synthesized with different Ag 
to Ti molar ratios (1:5, 1:3.1, 1:2.2, 1:1.7 and  1:0.8) and calcined at temperatures 
ranging from 150 -550 °C. In all the experiments, catalyst loading of 100 mg/L was 
used. For UV photocatalysis, air at a flow rate of 2 LPM was supplied as an oxidant RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
137 
 whereas, for solar photocatalysis, oxygen from atmosp heric air transferred to the 
solution and being present as dissolved oxygen in the dye solution, itself acted as the 
oxidant. The data on time course variations of AY -17 dye concentration during UV 
and solar photocatalysis are presented in Table 4.1 and Ta ble 4.2 respectively and the 
corresponding percentage degradation are presented in Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 
respectively.  Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2 show the representative plots of time course 
variations of percentage degradation by UV and solar photocatal ysis with Ag@TiO 2 
calcined at different temperatures. These Figures are presented for photocatalysis with 
Ag@TiO 2 synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:2.2 and 1:1.7 respectively. It is 
observed from the trend of the plots that the rate of degradation  with uncalcined 
catalyst is very low and as the calcination temperature of the catalyst  increases from 
150 ºC to 450 ºC, the rate of degradation increases. But the rate of degradation with 
the catalyst, calcined at 550 °C is lesser than or almost equal t o the rate achieved with 
the uncalcined catalyst. Similar results are also observed in case of UV and solar 
photocatalysis by catalysts prepared with other Ag to Ti molar ratios. Under UV 
photocatalysis, the time course variation of percentage degradation with Ag@TiO 2 
calcined at 550 °C showed initial increase in percentage dye removal with increase in 
irradiation time and then a decrease. Though the phenomena of decrease in removal of 
dyes at later times cannot be explained with confirmation, it may be hyp othesized that 
at calcination temperature of 550 °C, Ag core may not have an even coating of TiO 2 
on its surface. There may be a week binding (adsorption) of the dye on Ag surface or 
on TiO 2 film initially, which may further release into the solution on co ntinued 
stirring conditions or by the turbulence created with air bubbling. Or due to the 
coating of TiO 2 on Ag surface being uneven, lead to crevices on the surface of 
nanoparticles. Dye molecules may get trapped in these crevises initially, but released 
to the solution at later times due to continued stirring or by the turbulence created 
with air bubbling. These are only the hypothesis put forward, and further research is 
needed in this regard, which is beyond the scope of the current research work. But 
such a phenomena is not observed in solar photocatalysis, due to lower turbulence 
level in the absence of air bubbling.  
 Figure 4.3a shows that, as Ag to Ti molar ratio increases from 1:5 to 1:0.8 the 
degradation of AY -17 in 360 min of UV irradiation increa ses from 0.09 % to 10.3 %, RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
138 
 with uncalcined Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. As the Ag to Ti molar ratio was increased 
from 1:5 to 1:0.8, the degradation of AY -17 in 360 min of UV irradiation increased 
from 0.98 % to 25.2 %, with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles calcined at 150  ºC; 3.1 % to 
30.5 % with the nanoparticles calcined at 250 ºC; 6.43 % to 83.8 % with the 
nanoparticles calcined at 350 ºC. With the nanoparticles calcined at 450 ºC,  as Ag to 
Ti molar ratio was increased from  1:5 to 1:1.7, the degradation of AY -17 in 36 0 min 
of UV irradiation increased from 9.8 % to 99.2 %, but further increase in molar ratio 
to 1:0.8, decreased the degradation and was only around 42.1 %. With the 
nanoparticles calcined at 550 ºC,  as Ag to Ti molar ratio was increased from 1:5 to 
1:1.7,  the degradation of AY -17 in 360 min of UV irradiation increased from 0.14 % 
to 2.8 %, but further increase in molar ratio to 1:0.8 decreased the degradation to only 
around 0.22 % (at 360 min). So, highest percentage degradation was achieved with 
nanoparti cles calcined at a temperature of 450 ºC with all Ag to Ti molar ratios 
studied. But percentage degradation obtained using nanoparticles synthesized with Ag 
to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 was much higher than those obtained with other Ag to Ti 
molar ratios.  
 Similar observations were made for solar photocatalysis of AY -17 dye. Figure 
4.3b shows that, as Ag to Ti molar ratio increases from 1:5 to 1:0.8, the degradation of 
AY-17 in 360 min of solar irradiation increases from 1.67 % to 13.7 % with 
uncalcined Ag@Ti O2 nanoparticles; 4.11 % to 32.27 % with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles 
calcined at 150 ºC; 8.21 % to 34.81 % with those calcined at 250 ºC. Figure 4.3b also 
shows that, with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles calcined at 350 ºC, as Ag to Ti molar ratio 
increases from 1:5 to 1: 1.7 the degradation of AY -17 in 360 min of solar irradiation 
increases from 23.52 % to 99.46 %. But further increase in composition ratio to 1:0.8, 
did not result in any significant change in degradation. Similarly with Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles calcined at 45 0 ºC, as shown in Figure 4.3b, as Ag to Ti molar ratio was 
increased from  1:5 to 1:1.7 the degradation of AY -17 in 360 min of solar irradiation 
increased from 51.16 % to almost 100 %, but further increase in molar ratio to 1:0.8  
decreased the degradation  to around 96.24 % (at 360 min). Highest rate of 
degradation was found with nanoparticles synthesized with 1:1.7 molar ratio of Ag to 
Ti and calcined at 450 ºC as observed in Figure 4.2b. Almost complete degradation 
can be achieved within 60 min of irradia tion time by solar photocatalysis with those RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
139 
 nanoparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 and calcined at 450 ºC, as 
shown in Figure 4.2b. Figure 4.3b shows that, as Ag to Ti molar ratio increases from 
1:5 to 1:0.8, the degradation of AY -17 in 360 min of solar irradiation decreases from 
25.96 % to 11.72 %, with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles calcined at 550 ºC. So, highest 
percentage degradation was achieved with the nanoparticles calcined at a temperature 
of 450 ºC. This was observed with nanopartic les synthesized with all Ag to Ti molar 
ratios. But highest percentage degradation and rate of degradation were obtained 
using nanoparticles synthesized with 1:1.7 Ag to Ti molar ratio.  
 Increase in percentage degradation with calcination temperature is at tributed 
to the formation of crystalline phase of TiO 2, which increases with increasing 
calcination temperature, as reported by other researchers during degradation of Congo 
red dye ( Jian-Hua and Hai -Jun 2009; Bickley et al. 1991 ) with TiO 2 as a catalyst 
under UV light and Acid red B dye (Wang et al. 210) with Er3+:YAlO 3/ZnO –
TiO 2composite under sunlight . Increase in calcination temperature improves the 
crystallization and hence increases the activity of catalyst. TiO 2 has three crystalline 
phases: anatase, rutile and brookite, among which anatase is more reactive than rutile 
and reported to be responsible for the photocatalysis. It is reported, as calcination 
temperature increases the content of anatase phase increases but further increase in  
calcination temperature leads to change from anatase to rutile phase and rutile content 
increases as the temperature is increased (Ovenstone and Yanagisawa 1999; 
Behnajady et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2010).  
 In the present study, with nanoparticles calcined at 550 °C, decreased 
degradation was observed as compared to that with 450 °C, which may be due to 
phase conversion from anatase to rutile phase. TG -DTA analysis of the synthesized 
nanoparticles with Ag to Ti ratio of 1:1.7 presented later in Section 4.4.5 , showed a 
releasing peak at around 514 °C indicating the possible phase conversion of TiO 2 
from anatase to rutile which supports the decrease in photocatalytic degradation with 
nanoparticles calcined at 550 °C. Similar observation was also made by Zhang e t al. 
(2005). It is widely accepted that the anatase phase of titania is a relatively ideal 
photocatalytic material among its three crystalline phases (Ovenstone and 
Yanagisawa 1999). It is also reported by other researchers (Sivalingam et al. 2003; 
Nagave ni et al. 2004; Aarthi et al. 2007) that, TiO 2 containing only anatase phase RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 show better photocatalytic activity as compared to the commercial Degussa P -25 
catalyst which consists of 75 % anatase and 25 % rutile phase. It is observed, as 
calcination temper ature increases photocatalytic activity increases but further increase 
in calcination temperature leads to decrease in activity due to rutile phase formation. 
Decreased activity with nanoparticles calcined at 550 °C may also be due to increase 
in silver co ntent. It has also been observed that after calcination at 550 °C, the 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles turned to grey lustrous surface, characteristic of Ag, instead 
of the blackish brown film of TiO 2 on the surface as was found in the catalyst after 
calcination at other temperatures. It was found that for catalysts prepared with all Ag 
to Ti molar ratios , as the calcination temperature was increased, degradation increased 
but further increase in calcination temperature to above 450 ºC lead to decrease in 
degradation . Hence, highest degradation was found at 450 °C and it can be considered 
as the optimum calcination temperature.  
 Optimization of composition plays a very important role in the structure and 
morphology of the catalyst. Angkaew and Limsuwan  (2012) studied the effect of Ti to 
Ag molar ratio on two step synthesized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. They reported that at 
low concentration of titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) as a precursor salt for Ti,  TiO 2 
can be effectively formulated on Ag nanoparticle s which lead to the formation of 
core-shell structure but higher concentration lead to formation of core -shell particles 
with larger shell thickness. However, in their studies, too high concentration of TTIP 
lead to the composite structure with Ag nanopart icles embedded in TiO 2 matrix. 
According to them, the effect of Ag -Ti mole ratio on the morphology of nanoparticles 
can be explained in terms of the available nucleation sites and growth of titania 
particles on the pre -existing surface of silver nanopartic les. Since it was found that 
molar ratio is an important parameter in controlling the morphology of the resulting 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles,  optimization of Ag to Ti molar ratio was carried out in the 
present study by varying the concentration of TTEAIP and A gNO 3 in the synthesis 
mixture for the formation of Ag core and TiO 2 shell.   
 As it is evident from Figure 4.3, with the increase in Ag to Ti molar ratio from 
1:5 to 1:1.7 the percentage degradation increases. But further increase in the ratio to 
1:0.8 has  lead to decrease in the degradation. The maximum degradation occurred 
with nanoparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7. In order to RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 understand the reason for maximum photocatalytic activity by nanoparticles 
synthesized with 1:1.7 Ag to Ti  ratio, XRD of the nanoparticles were obtained for  the 
nanoparticles synthesized with different Ag to Ti molar ratios (1:5, 1:3.1, 1:2.2, 1:1.7; 
1:0.8) and calcined at  450 ºC for  3 h and are shown in Figure 4.4.  
 Table 4.5 shows the presence of differe nt crystal planes of Ag and TiO 2 in 
nanoparticles synthesized with different Ag to Ti molar ratio and calcined at a 
temperature of 450 ºC for 3 h, where (A) and (R) correspond to the anatase and rutile 
planes of TiO 2 respectively and (111), (200), (220), a nd (311) correspond to the 
different crystal planes of Ag0. 
 Average crystallite size of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles prepared with different Ag 
to Ti molar ratio (1:5, 1:3.1, 1:2.2, 1:1.7; 1:0.8) were calculated based on the 
Scherrer’s formula and are presented in Table 4.6. X -Ray diffractogram of Ag@TiO 2 
catalysts synthesized with different composition ra tios of Ag to Ti and which were 
calcined at temperature of 450 ºC for 3 h, as shown in Figure 4.4a to Figure 4.4e and 
as summarized in Table 4.5 reveal that, as the Ag to Ti molar ratio increases, increase 
in crystallinity is observed and it also resulted in increase in anatase phase of TiO 2. 
Decrease in particle size (Table 4.6) of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles was observed as the 
Ag to Ti molar composition ratio was increased from 1:5 to 1:0.8. Smaller the size of 
particles, larger is the specific surface area an d the rate of photocatalysis increases 
with the increase in specific surface area. As shown in Figure 4.3, as Ag to Ti molar 
ratio increases till 1:1.7, the percentage degradation of the dye at a particular 
irradiation time increases as an evidence of incr ease in rate of photocatalysis. 
Although smallest crystallite size was found with 1:0.8 Ag to Ti molar ratio as seen in 
Table 4.6, percentage degradation is lower than that obtained with the nanoparticles 
synthesized with 1:1.7 molar ratio. The X -Ray diffr actogram of Ag@TiO 2 synthesized 
with 1:0.8 Ag to Ti molar ratio, presented in Figure 4.4e showed only one anatase 
phase peak. But many anatase peaks were observed in nanoparticles synthesized with 
1:1.7 Ag to Ti molar ratio as shown in Figure 4.4d. In case  of particles with 1:5, 1:3.1, 
1:2.2 Ag to Ti molar ratios, presence of both anatase and rutile phase were observed 
in XRD presented in Figure 4.4a to Figure 4.4c and peak for AgO was also found.  
Wang et al. (2008b) have reported that the presence of AgO in Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles result in decrease in photocatalytic property.  But in case of RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 nanoparticles with 1: 1.7 molar ratio of Ag to Ti (Figure 4.4d), three peaks of anatase 
phase of TiO 2  and well defined crytalline structure were found as compared to 
nanoparticles synthesized with other molar ratios and no peaks of  rutile TiO 2 and  
AgO were found.  These are the main reasons of high photocatalytic activity shown 
by nanoparticles with 1:1.7 molar ratio of Ag to Ti. Highest photocatalytic activity 
with na noparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7, can also be 
contributed to a Schottky energy barrier formed by the combination of Ag core and 
TiO 2 shells. The interface can attract light -induced electrons from the semiconductor 
TiO 2 to reduce e lectron –hole recombination. Presence of AgO which resulted due to 
oxidation of Ag, can be verified by the appearance of AgO diffraction peaks in Figure 
4.4a to Figure 4.4c at lower Ag to Ti molar ratios. The AgO cannot serve as a 
Schottky energy barrier (W ang et al. 2008b). But no AgO peak was observed with 
nanoparticles synthesized with 1:1.7 molar ratio. Hence lower photocatalytic activity 
was observed at Ag to Ti ratios of 1:5 to 1:2.2. From the results of photocatalytic 
degradation, the least Ag content  sample (1:5) showed the least photocatalytic 
activity. This may also be because of the thicker TiO 2 shell which inhibits light -
induced electrons from arriving at the interface between the Ag cores and the TiO 2 
shells at low Ag to Ti ratio used during synt hesis (Wang et al. 2008b).  
 With 1:0.8 Ag to Ti molar composition ratio, in the XRD shown in Figure 
4.4.e, there was no AgO peak and though anatase phase peak observed. Ag (1, 1, 1) 
peak showed the highest intensity for these nanoparticles, as compared to 
nanoparticles synthesized with other ratios, indicating that the silver content is 
predominant. So lower photocatalytic activity shown by particles with 1:0.8 Ag to Ti 
molar ratio, may be due to high Ag content and very less TiO 2. Owing to high Ag and 
less Ti, not enough TiO 2 may be formed during the synthesis process, to grow as a 
film around all the Ag nuclei surface. Surface coverage of Ag core with TiO 2 may be 
very less and the  decreasing content of TiO 2 means that fewer electrons were 
generated to take  part in the photodegradation of dyes, hence leading to lower 
photocatalytic activity.  
 Due to the presence of more anatase phase TiO 2, formation of well defined 
crystalline structure with core shell morphology and absense of AgO, Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 and calcination RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 temperature of 450 °C were found to be the optimum conditions for maximum 
photocatalytic activity in terms of photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 dye under UV 
and solar light irr adiation. Hence Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti 
molar ratio of  1:1.7 and calcined at 450 °C were used for further experiments.

 4.1.2 Effect of calcination temperature and Ag to Ti molar ratio on 
photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 in terms of photocatalytic degradation of 
RB-220 under UV and solar light irradiation  
  
 To study the effect of Ag to Ti molar ratio used during synthesis and the 
calcination temperature of the catalyst on the degradation of RB -220, batch 
photocatalysis experiments  were carried under UV and solar light irradiations in 
stirred reactor at initial dye concen tration of 50 mg/L in aqueous solution and  at 
initial pH=3 with Ag@TiO 2 catalysts synthesized with different Ag to Ti molar ratios 
(1:5, 1:3.1, 1:2.2, 1:1.7 and 1:0.8) and calcined at temperatures ranging from 150 -550 
°C. In all the experiments, catalyst loading of 1 g/L for UV photocatalysis and 500 
mg/L for solar photocatal ysis were used. For UV photocatalysis, air at a flow rate of 2 
LPM was supplied to provide oxygen as an oxidant whereas for solar photocatalysis, 
atmospheric air transferred to the solution and being present as dissolved oxygen in 
the dye solution itself a cted as an oxidant.  
The data on time course variations of RB -220 dye concentration during UV and solar 
photocatalysis are presented in Table 4.7 and Table 4.8 respectively and the 
corresponding percentage degradation are presented in Table 4.9 and Table 4 .10 
respectively. Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6 show the representative plots of time course 
variations of percentage degradation by UV and solar photocatalysis of RB -220 with 
Ag@TiO 2 calcined at different temperatures. These Figures are presented for 
photocat alysis with Ag@TiO 2 synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:2.2 and 
1:1.7 respectively. It is observed from the trend of the plots, the rate of degradation 
with uncalcined catalyst is very low and as the calcination temperature of the catalyst  
increase s from 150 ºC to 450 ºC, the rate of degradation increases. But the rate of 
degradation with the catalyst, calcined at 550 °C is lesser than or almost equal to the 
rate achieved with the uncalcined catalyst. Similar results were also observed in case 
of UV  and solar photocatalysis by catalysts prepared with other Ag to Ti molar ratios.  
 Figure 4.7a and Figure 4.7b show that the maximum percentage degradation 
of RB -220 dye is obtained with the nanoparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti molar 
ratio of 1:1.7 and  that calcined at a temperature of 450 °C both for UV and solar 
photocatalysis, as the case with AY -17 dye degradation. The percentage degradation RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
154 
 obtained using nanoparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 is much 
higher than those obtaine d with other Ag to Ti molar ratios. 98.92 % degradation of 
RB-220 occurred in 240 min of irradiation with UV light and nearly 100 % 
degradation occurred in 180 min of solar light irradiation with the Ag@TiO 2 catalyst 
synthesized with 1:1.7 Ag to Ti molar r atio and calcined at 450 ºC. The rate of 
degradation obtained using nanoparticles synthesized with 1:1.7 Ag to Ti molar ratio 
was much higher than those synthesized with other ratios.  
 Increase in degradation with calcination temperature is attributed to t he 
formation of crystalline phase of TiO 2 and the effect of calcination temperature and 
Ag to Ti molar ratio on photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 in terms of photocatalytic 
degradation of RB -220 can be explained on similar grounds as it is explained for t he 
degradation of AY -17 dye in Section 4.1.1.  
 Hence Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 in synthesis mixture and calcination 
temperature of 450 °C were found to be the optimum conditions for maximum 
photocatalytic activity in terms of photocatalytic degradatio n of RB -220 dye under 
UV and solar light irradiation. So Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti 
molar ratio of  1:1.7 and calcined at 450 °C were used for further experiments.

 4.2 Effect of catalyst calcination time on the photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 
in terms of photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dye under UV and 
solar light irradiation  
 
Calcination time affects the photocatalytic activity by determining the existence of 
crystalline phases present in the photocatalyst. So, the photocataly tic degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 in aqueous solution under UV and solar light irradiation at initial 
pH=3 was studied using Ag@TiO 2 catalysts synthesized with the Ag to Ti molar ratio 
of 1:1.7 and calcined at 450ºC for different calcination time periods ranging from 1 to 
5 h. Experiments were performed with initial dye concentration of 10 mg/L and 
catalyst loading of 100 mg/L for both  UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 dye.   
Similarly the degradation of RB -220 dye was studied with the initial concentration of 
50 mg/L; catalyst loading of 1 g/L for UV photocatalysis and 500 mg/L for solar 
photocatalysis.  For UV photocatalysis experi ments, air at a flow rate of 2 LPM was 
supplied as an oxidant whereas for solar photocatalysis, atmospheric air transferred to 
the solution and being present as dissolved oxygen in the dye solution itself acted as 
an oxidant.  
 The data on time course vari ations of AY -17 dye concentration during UV and 
solar photocatalysis are presented in Table 4.11. Figure 4.8a shows the time course 
variation of percentage degradation of AY -17 dye during UV photocatalysis 
experiments carried out with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles  calcined at  450 ºC for different 
calcination times. Time course variations have shown that, the rate of degradation of 
the dye increases with increase in calcination time from 1 to 3 h, but further increase 
in calcination time to 4 and 5 h, results in de creased rate of degradation. Effect of 
catalyst calcination time on percentage degradation of AY -17 dye (at 360 min 
irradiation time) with the catalyst calcined at different times is shown in Figure 4.9a. 
Figure 4.9a shows that, as the calcination time inc reases from 1 to 3 h the degradation 
in 360 min of irradiation time increases from 80.65 % to 99.2 %, but further increase 
in calcination time from 4 to 5 h leads to decreased degradation and it reached to only 
around 0.018 % (at 360 min). Therefore, the h ighest degradation with UV 
photocatalysis was observed with the nanoparticles calcined for 3 h.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

  Figure 4.8b shows the time course variation of percentage degradation of AY -
17 dye and Figure 4.9b shows the effect of catalyst calcination time on percentage 
degradation of AY -17 dye (at 360 min irradiation time) during  solar photocatalysis 
experiments carried out with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles calcined at  450 ºC for different 
calcinations times. Time course variations have shown that, the rate of degradation of 
the dye increases with increase in calcination time as discussed previously for UV 
photocatalysis. As evident from Figure 4.9b, highest degradation (≈100 %) with solar 
photocatalysis occurred with the nanoparticles calcined for 3 h.  
         The data on time course variations of RB -220 dye concentration during UV and 
solar photocatalysis are presented in Table 4.12. Figure 4.10a shows the time course 
variation of percentage degradation of RB -220 dye during UV photocatalysis 
experiment s carried out with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles calcined for different 
calcination times. Time course variations have shown that, the rate of degradation of 
the dye increases with increase in calcination time. Effect of catalyst calcination time 
on percentage deg radation of RB -220 dye (at 240 min irradiation time) presented in 
Figure 4.11a, shows that, as calcination time increased from 1 to 3 h the degradation 
of RB -220 in 240 min of irradiation time increased from 82.54 % to 98.92 %, but 
further increase in calc ination time from 3 to 5 h decreased the degradation, which 
reached to only around 16.05 % (at 240 min). Similar observations on effect of 
calcination time were made from Figure 4.10b and 4.11b for solar photocatalysis of 
RB-220 dye. Figure 4.11b shows tha t, as calcination time increases from 1 to 3 h the 
degradation in 180 min of irradiation time increased from 93.66 % to around 100 %, 
but further increase in calcination time from 3 to 5 h decreases the degradation, which 
reached to only around 27.88 % (at  180 min). Therefore, the highest degradation was 
observed at calcination time of 3 h for UV and solar photocatalysis of RB -220 dye.  
 Increase in degradation of the dyes with increase in calcination time may be 
attributed to increase in content of anatase TiO 2, which increases with increasing 
calcination time. It is reported by You et al. (2005), Mozia (2008) and Wang et al. 
(2010) that, as calcination time increases, formation of anatase phase increase but 
further increase in time lead to conversion of ana tase phase to rutile phase which 
decreases the photocatalytic activity. As seen from XRD (Figure 4.4d) at calcination 
time of 3 h, anatase TiO 2 was found, so catalyst calcined at 450 ºC for 3 h showed RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 better photocatalytic efficiency for photocatalytic deg radation of AY -17 and RB -220 
dyes.  As the calcination time increased degradation increased, but further increase in 
the calcination time to above 3h decreased the degradation. Therefore calcination time 
of 3 h was found to be the optimum.  
 Thus the Ag@Ti O2 nanoparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 
1:1.7 and calcined at 450 ºC for 3 h was found to be optimum for maximum 
photocatalytic activity in terms of degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 under UV and 
solar light irradiation.

4.3 Photocatalytic efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles and its suitability as a 
photocatalyst in degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes  
 
When photocatalysis experiments were performed with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles 
synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7, calcined at 450°C for 3 h, good 
degrada tion of the dyes occurred.  In order to confirm the role of Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles as photocatalysts in degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes and to 
confirm their suitability as photocatalysts,  the photodegradation of AY -17 and RB -
220 dyes were studied (a) u nder a light source (UV and solar) and in the absence of 
any catalyst, (b) under dark conditions with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles, and (c) with 
Ag@TiO 2 under UV and solar light irradiations. Figure 4.12a and 4.12b show the 
comparison of degradation of AY -17 as the function of time for control experiments 
(under light in the absence of Ag@TiO 2) or with Ag@TiO 2 (under dark)  with the 
results obtained when UV and solar light was used with Ag@TiO 2. The initial 
concentration o f AY -17 used was 10 mg/L. Figure 4.13a and 4.13b show the

 (under light (absence of Ag@TiO 2) or with Ag@TiO 2 (under dark) ) with the results 
obtained when UV and solar light wa s used with Ag@TiO 2. The initial concentration 
of RB -220 used was 50 mg/L. No significant dye degradation occurred i n the absence 
of catalyst and AY -17 or RB -220 solutions were found to be stable on irradiation with 
UV and solar light irradiation, indicati ng that no photolysis occurs. Under dark 
conditions and in the presence of Ag@TiO 2, around 25 % degradation of AY -17 dye 
occurred in 60 min and % degradation remained constant after 60 min. Under dark 
conditions and in the presence Ag@TiO 2, around 7 % degr adation of RB -220 dye 
occurred in 60 min and around 8 % degradation occurred after 240 min of irradiation. 
It is because of the adsorption of dye molecules on the surface of Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles (Gupta et al. 2007). On the other hand degradation of AY -17 dye 
increased drastically and almost complete degradation of dye occurred within 360 min 
under UV irradiation and within 60 min under solar light irradiation when Ag@TiO 2 
at loading of 100 mg/L was used as catalyst. Similarly, degradation of RB -220 
increas ed continuously at a fast rate and almost complete degradation occurred within 
240 min under UV irradiation and within 60 min under solar light irradiation when 
Ag@TiO 2 at loading of 1 g/L (UV) and 500 mg/L (solar) were used as catalyst.  
 The rates of degr adation of AY -17 or RB -220 with the catalyst under solar 
light were tremendously faster as compared to those with the catalyst under UV light. 
As Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles get illuminated by light (UV or solar), reactive species 
such as H2O2, O 2.- and .OH are produced. The azo bond of the dyes would have been 
attacked by these reactive species which lead to cleavage of azo bond and thus causes 
degradation. This confirms that the cause of degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes 
is photocatalysis by Ag@TiO 2 under UV  and solar light irradiation. Hence it is 
concluded that Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles are effective photocatalysts for the 
degradation of azo dyes such as AY -17 and RB -220 both for UV and solar 
photocatalysis and hence are suitable for treatment of water contamin ated with these 
dyes by photocatalysis.

 4.4 Characterization of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles  
 
It was concluded from the results discussed in Section 4.1 -4.2 that, Ag@TiO 2 catalyst 
synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 and calcined at  a temperature of 450 
ºC for  3 h exhibited  highest photocatalytic activity for UV and solar photocatalysis 
of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes. They were found to be effective photocatalysts f or the 
degradation of azo dyes such as AY -17 and RB -220. Further these Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles were characterized using TEM, SAED, EDS, AFM, XRD, TG -DTA, 
DRS and BET to determine their size, shape, crystalline nature, light absorption 
behavior, band gap, the rmal characteristics, surface area etc, in order to understand 
their behavior as photocatalysts for UV and solar photocatalysis.  
 
4.4.1 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)  
 
Figure 4.14 and Figure 4.15 present the TEM images of the Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticle 
synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 and calcined at 450 °C for 3h, at 
different magnifications. These images show the formation of core -shell structure. 
Figure 4.15a and b; show the TEM images of a single Ag@TiO 2 core-shell 
nanoparticle at high magnifications. These images confirm the formation of core -shell 
structure and the visible crystal lattice in the structure in Figure 4.15b confirms the 
crystallinity of the nanoparticle. The black central portion indicates the presence of 
Ag core and the white outer layer around the Ag core is the TiO 2 shell as seen from 
Figure 4.14b, 4.15a and 4.15b. Also in bulk portion of the image in Figure 4.14a, 
several particles are shown with Ag core covered by TiO 2 shell. The particles were 
slightly oval in shape.  The core of the particle is of average diameter of 33.63 nm and 
TiO 2 shell has the average thickness 3.7 nm. The size of core -shell structure was 
found to be around 37.33 nm. The corresponding SAED pattern of Ag@TiO 2 is also 
shown in inset of Figure 4.14c . Each diffraction rings correspond to the crystal planes 
of Ag and TiO 2. Hence SAED analysis and the XRD shown in Figure 4.4d of Section 
4.1.1 confirmed the crystallinity of core -shell structures and are in good agreement 
with each other.  
 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
172 
 4.4.2 Energy Di spersive spectra (EDS)  
 
Figure 4.16 illustrates the EDS spectra of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. The presence of 
Cu in the spectra is due to the copper grid used in the TEM measurement. The EDS 
analysis showed the presence of O, Ti, and Ag elements in Ag@TiO 2. 
 
4.4.3 Atomic Force Microscopic (AFM) analysis  
 
The AFM image (Figure 4.17) reveals the formation of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles . As it 
can be seen in Figure 4.17, silver core is in the form of well -defined oval nanoparticle 
and is covered by TiO 2 shell. This anal ysis is in good agreement with the TEM 
analysis. The analyses confirmed the formation of core -shell structure. Kim et al. 
(2004) and Zhang et al. (2005) synthesized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles by two pot 
synthesis method. They had shown the presence of core shel l structure through a TEM 
image before calcination, but had not shown any evidence on the retainment of core 
shell structure after calcination. But in the present study, the TEM and AFM analysis 
of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles confirms the presence of core shell structure in the 
calcined nanoparticle. Figure 4.18 presents the particle size distribution curve of 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles and it shows that the nanoparticles are polydispersed and the 
size varied in the range of 10 -50 nm with the average particle size of approximately 
30nm. This result is in good agreement with TEM results. The double peaks 
corresponding to particles of size 26 and 32 nm in the size distribution curve indicate 
that these two particle sizes are found more frequently in the distribution . 
 
4.4.4 X -Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis  
 
XRD analysis of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles  was carried out to check the crystalline 
nature of core -shell nanoparticles. The discussions on the XRD of Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles synthesized with Ag to Ti molar composition ratio of 1:1.7, calcined at 
450°C for 3h has already been presented in Section 4.1.1 and the XRD shown in 
Figure 4.4d confirmed t he crystalline nature of both Ag core and TiO 2 shell. The XRD 
reveal ed the presence of anatase phase TiO 2.No peaks of rutile phase TiO 2 or AgO RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 reflection peak (2 θ=30.2) were observed in the diffraction pattern. Absence of AgO 
indicates that Ag core exist as Ag0 in Ag@TiO 2 and there is no possibility of lowering 
of photocat alytic activity which would have occurred if AgO was present, as reported 
by Wang et al. (2008b).  
 The average crystallite size of these nanoparticles was calculated using 
Scherrer’s formula and presented in Table 4.6. The average crystallite size calculat ed 
by Scherrer’s formula being 39.40 nm, is in close agreement with the average particle 
size of  37.33 nm obtained by TEM and reasonably matches with the particle size 
range obtained with particle size distribution by AFM analysis.  
 
4.4.5 Thermo gravimet ric-differential thermal ( TG-DTA) analysis  
 
To study the thermal characteristics of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles, TG -DTA analysis 
was performed. The TG -DTA curve for the synthesized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles is 
shown in Figure 4.19. The temperature - weight loss course can be divided into three 
stages in TG curve. The first stage between 0 and 100 °C corresponds to desorption or 
release of solvent and water in the sample, second stage between 100 and 350 °C 
corresponds to combustion and decomposition of organic ma tter, produced from the 
hydrolysis of TTEAIP, and the third correspond to weight loss in the range of 350 – 
600 °C, which is not very obvious and may be due to the dissociation of hydroxyl 
groups from the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles. DTA r esults indicate  the appearance of 
a decalescence peak at 61.9 °C on the curve , which corresponds to desorption or 
release of solvent and water in the nanoparticles.  As the temperature increases, two 
releasing peaks at 262.1 and 345.2 °C corresponding to combustion and 
decomposition of organic matter are observed. In the range of 350 – 600 °C, few 
decalescence and releasing peaks are also present, which may be due to the phase 
conversion of TiO 2 from amorphous to anatase (around 350 °C), surface hydroxyl 
groups dissociatio n (350 –600 °C) and phase conversion of TiO 2 from anatase to rutile 
(around 514 °C). Similar observations were made by Zhang et al. (2005). These 
discussions on TG -DTA results, presenting the possible phase conversion of TiO 2 
from amorphous to anatase phase  at around 350°C and from anatase to rutile at 
temperatures of around 514 °C is supported by the experimental results on effect of RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 calcination temperature on photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes 
which are presented in Figure 4.3 and Figure 4 .7 respectively. These Figures show 
increase in photocatalytic activity with increase in calcination temperature upto 450 
°C and decrease in the activity with further increase in calcination temperature to 550 
°C. So, decreased activity at 550 °C may be ow ing to conversion of anatase to rutile 
phase of TiO 2 at temperatures greater than 514 °C as indicated by TGA results.  
 
4.4.6 Diffuse Reflectance Spectra (DRS) analysis  
 
The DRS of the Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles (Figure 4.20) showed a sharp reflectance 
peak at 320 nm in the UV region which is the characteristic of TiO 2 corresponding to 
the charge transfer process from the valence band to conduction band in TiO 2 (Li et 
al. 2008). The Ag@TiO 2 also shows strong visible light absorption in the range of 398 
- 509 nm and maximum is seen at 509 nm . It shows that, Ag@TiO 2 is able to absorb 
both UV light and portion of visible light, maximum visible light absorption being at 
509 nm. The visible light absor ption of Ag@TiO 2 particles, as seen by the occurrence 
of red shift is due to the surface plasmon resonance of Ag core and it is strongly 
influenced by the oxide shell (Rodriguez -Gattorno et al. 2002). The high dielectric 
constant of TiO 2 shell causes a red  shift in the plasmon absorption of the silver core 
(Chan and Barteau 2005; Mulvaney 1996; Liz -Marzán and Mulvaney 2003; Kreibig 
and Vollmer 1995). The ability of these core -shell nanoparticles to absorb both UV 
and visible light shall enhance their photoc atalytic activity in solar light, which 
constitutes small portion of UV and majority being the visible light. The DRS analysis 
hence supports the solar photocatalytic activity of these nanoparticles as observed in 
Figure 4.12 and Figure 4.13 in terms of so lar photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 
and RB -220 dyes respectively.  
 
4.4.7 Band gap determination  
 
The band gap energy which is the minimum energy required for an electron to be 
excited from valance band to conduction band is an important characteristic of any 
photocatalyst. The band gap energy of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles was determined from RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
175 
 DRS using Kubelka Munk’s model. Firstly the reflectance data were fitted to Kubelka 
Munk’s model for direct Eq.(3.4)  and indirect Eq.(3.3) band gap transition to establi sh 
the type of band to band transition in Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles. It was seen, when 
reflectance data was fitted to indirect band gap transition, band gap energy with 
negative value was obtained which is not realistic. So the data was fitted to direct 
transi tion and Figure 4.21 shows the Tauc’s plot of (k×h  )2 versus h  for Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles. The data fitted well into Kubelka Munk’s model for direct transition.  
The band gap energy was estimated from linear portion of the plot by drawing tangent 
and intersection of the tangent to the plotted curve inflection point with the horizontal 
axis resulted in the band gap energy value of 1.85eV. Direct band gap transition is 
found to be favorable with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles in the present study. Since in the 
present study Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles consist of anatase phase TiO 2 and it is reported 
in literature by Reddy et al. (2002) that direct band gap transition is more favourable 
when anatase phase of TiO 2 is prese nt. In direct band gap materials, the electronic 
transition is electrical dipole allowed and in indirect band gap materials, it is electrical 
dipole forbidden and photon assisted.  Both energy and momentum are changed 
during indirect transition. In direct band gap transition absorption and emission is 
much stronger as compared to indirect band gap transition. So a direct band gap 
transition can result in a more efficient absorption of solar energy (Reddy et al. 2002) 
and hence much better photocatalytic pro perties. The band gap energy of Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles was found to be around 1.85eV, which is much lesser than the band gap 
energy for TiO 2 (3.2eV), indicating that Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles have all the potential 
to be excited by longer wavelength radiations in visible range and hence can be used 
effectively for solar photocatalysis. Lower band gap energy value justifies the solar 
photocatalytic activity of these nanoparticles as observed in Figure 4.12 and Figure 
4.13 in terms of solar photocatalytic degradat ion of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes 
respectively.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 4.4.8 Surface area analysis (BET)  
 
The surface area of the catalyst is an important factor affecting the rate of 
photocatalysis. The specific surface area of nanoparticles is the sum o f the areas of the 
exposed surfaces of the particles per unit mass (Akbari et al. 2011). Smaller the 
particles, larger will be the specific surface area and hence rate of photocatalysis will 
be higher with smaller sized particles due to higher availability  of more active sites 
per unit mass. The specific surface area of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles was determined by 
nitrogen gas adsorption BET method and found to be 22.93m2/g. 
 
4.5 Comparison of photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured 
nanoparticle s with other photocatalysts for degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 
dyes under UV and solar light irradiation  
 
The efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles as a photocatalyst was compared with other 
catalysts such as TiO 2 and Ag doped TiO 2 based on the degradation of AY -17 and 
RB-220 dyes under UV and solar light irradiations. In case of UV photocatalysis, air 
was bubbled through the solution continuously to act as an oxidant. In case of solar 
photocatalysis, continuous bubbling of air was f ound not necessary as the results 
obtained in the presence and absence of air bubbling matched with each other, 
indicating that dissolved oxygen (DO) present in the reaction mixture initially and 
subsequent dissolution from atmospheric air during the exper iments, itself was 
sufficient to serve as an oxidant, for the reaction duration.  
 
4.5.1 Comparison of photocatalytic activity in terms of degradation of AY -17 dye 
under UV and solar light irradiation  
  
 The photocatalytic efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 for the degrad ation of AY -17 dye 
with initial concentration of 10 mg/L, catalyst loading of 100 mg/L, and at initial pH 3 
was compared with commercially available Degussa P -25 catalyst, SGTiO 2, CSTiO 2, 
Ag doped -SGTiO 2, Ag doped (LI) -CSTiO 2, and Ag doped (PD) -CSTiO 2.

 are shown in Figure 4.22a and 4.22b for UV and solar light irradiations respectively. 
These Figures clearly show that Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles are the most efficient 
photocata lysts in degradation of AY -17 dye as compared to other catalysts under 
study and photocatalytic activity in terms of degradation of AY -17 dye is in the order 
of Ag@TiO 2 > Degussa P25 > Ag doped -SGTiO 2> Ag doped (LI) -CSTiO 2> SGTiO 2> 
CSTiO 2> Ag doped (PD) -CSTiO 2 under UV light. Under solar irradiation, the 
activities are rated as Ag@TiO 2> Ag doped -SGTiO 2> Degussa P25 > SGTiO 2> Ag 
doped (LI) -CSTiO 2> CSTiO 2> Ag doped (PD) -CSTiO 2. Though the specific surface 
area of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles (22.93m2/g) is lesser than that of Degussa P25 
(50m2/g), high photocatalytic activity is exhibited by Ag@TiO 2 both under UV and 
solar light irradiations, which might be due to their ability to inhibit electron -hole 
recombination, by storage of electron in Ag core and subsequent discharge on 
provision of electron acceptor such as O 2 (Hirakawa and Kamat 2005 ), owing to their 
capability to absorb both UV and visible light radiations of solar light and also due to 
low band gap energy. In case of solar light with Ag@TiO 2 catalyst, a lmost 100 % 
degradation of the dye occurred in 60 min and around 89 % degradation occurred 
within 15 min; whereas with UV light, it took around 360 min for around 100 % 
degradation. It is found that c atalyst loading and irradiation time require d for solar 
photocatalysis is much lesser than that used in UV photocatalysis . In comparison to 
UV photocatalysis, under solar light rate of photocatalysis was very high with 
Ag@TiO 2 catalyst, due to its potential to absorb both UV and visible light portio ns of 
solar radiation, as indicated by DRS spectrum shown in Figure 4.19 and also due to 
low band gap energy of 1.85eV. As discussed in Section 4.3.7, direct band gap 
transition can result in a more efficient absorption of solar energy, so this may be 
another reason of high photocatalytic activity observed by Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles 
under solar photocatalysis.  
 Lower photocatalytic efficacy exhibited by Degussa P25, SGTiO 2, and 
CSTiO 2 may be due to the electron -hole recombination, leading to low quantum yield  
and due to higher band gap energy of 3.2eV for TiO 2. However, less photocatalytic 
efficacy exhibited by Ag doped -SGTiO 2, and Ag doped (LI) -CSTiO 2 may be due to 
loss of activity of TiO 2, as metal deposits occupy the active sites on the TiO 2 surface 
(Colema n et al. 2005). Less activity was shown by Ag doped (PD) -CSTiO 2 as the RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 negative charge on silver may start to attract holes and then recombine with electrons 
leading to recombination of electron -hole (Carp et al. 2004) thus lowering the 
photocatalytic acti vity. 
 
4.5.2 Comparison of photocatalytic activity in terms of degradation of RB -220 
under UV and solar light irradiation  
 
 The photocatalytic efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 in terms of  degradation of RB -220 
dye with initial concentration of 50 mg/L, and at initial pH of 3 was compared with 
commercially available Degussa P -25 catalyst, SGTiO 2, CSTiO 2, Ag doped -SGTiO 2, 
Ag doped(LI) -CSTiO 2, and Ag doped (PD) -CSTiO 2. In all the  experiments, catalyst 
loading of 1 g/L for UV photocatalysis and 500 mg/L for solar photocatalysis were 
used. The photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 using different catalysts at various 
irradiation times are shown in Figure 4.23a and 4.23b for UV and so lar light

more efficient photocatalysts in the degradation of RB -220 dye as compared to other 
catalysts and photocatalytic activity is rated in the order of Ag@TiO 2> Degus sa P25>

doped (LI) -CSTiO 2. High p hotocatalytic efficacy is exhibited by Ag@TiO 2 under UV 
and solar light irradiations. The reason for higher activity of Ag@TiO 2 in terms 
degradation of RB -220 dye are similar to those discussed in Section 4.5.1 for 
photocatalysis of AY -17 dye. In case of s olar photocatalysis with Ag@TiO 2 catalyst, 
almost 100 % degradation of RB -220 occurred within 60 min, whereas with UV 
photocatalysis, it took around 240 min. It can also be noted that, the c atalyst loading 
and irradiation time required for solar photocatalysis is much lesser than that used in 
UV photocatalysis . Rate of photocatalysis under solar light is much higher than that 
under UV photocatalysis, due to the potential of Ag@TiO 2 to absorb both UV and 
visible light portions of solar radiation, low band gap energy and due to direct band 
gap transition, as already discussed in Section 4.5.1.   The reasons for l ower

 doped (LI) -CSTiO 2 are already explained in Section 4.5.1 for photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 dye and are as well valid for the degradation of RB -220 dye.  
             Ag@TiO 2 catalyst showed appreciably better UV photocatalytic activity and 
it excels in terms of its solar photocatalytic activity for the deg radation of both AY -17 
and RB -220 dyes, in comparison to other commercial and synthesized catalysts. So 
Ag@TiO 2 can be effectively used as a photocatalyst for the degradation of dyes by 
both UV and solar photocatalytic process for the treatment of dye cont aminated 
wastewaters. Further optimization of process conditions is necessary for exploitation 
of the process into industrial scale operations.

 4.6. Effect of operational factors on the UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 
and RB -220 dyes  
 
In the earlier Sections it is reported that Ag@TiO 2 catalyst is very effective for UV 
and solar photocatalysis of azo dyes such as AY -17 and RB -220. If the photocatalysis 
process is to be exploited in industrial scale operations for the treatment of dye 
contaminated wastewaters, there is a necessity to look for different ways by which 
rate of photocatalysis may be improved. If the rate needs to be enhanced, then it is 
very important to determine the various operational factors that influence the rate of 
photocatalysis and then to optimize the process. From extensive review of literature 
reported  in Section 2.6, it was noted that factors such as pH, catalyst loading, initial 
dye concentration and oxidants influence the rate of photocatalysis and hence the 
effect of these factors were studied and the results are discussed in the present section.  
 
4.6.1 Effect of pH on the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 under 
UV and solar light irradiation  
 
 The pH of wastewater contaminated with dyes varies l argely according to the 
type of dyes present in it. The pH of the solution dominantly affects the photocatalytic 
degradation process because change in pH affects the surface charge property of TiO 2, 
charge of dye molecule, adsorption of dye on to TiO 2 surface and hydroxyl radical 
concentration. So, it is necessary to study the effect of pH on photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 under UV and solar light irradiation. To study the 
effect of pH, batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted in a st irred reactor 
under UV and solar light irradiation with AY -17 and RB -220 dyes. In case of UV 
photocatalysis experiments, air at a flow rate of 2 LPM was supplied continuously and 
it acted as an oxidant. But for solar photocatalysis no additional air was su pplied and 
the dissolved oxygen in the reaction mixture itself acted as an oxidant.

 4.6.1.1 Effect of pH on the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 under UV and 
solar light irradiation  
 
To study the effect of pH, photocatalytic degradation experiments with AY -17 at 
concentration of 10 mg/L in aqueous solution were performed under UV and solar 
light irradiation, by varying the initial pH from 2 to 9. The catalyst loading of 100 
mg/L was us ed in all the experiments under UV and solar light irradiation. Time 
course variations of AY -17 dye concentrations obtained with different initial pH 
conditions are shown in Table 4.13 -4.14 respectively for UV and solar photocatalysis. 
In order to confirm the effect of initial pH, control experiments at different initial pH 
were also done under a light source (UV or solar) and in the absence of catalyst. No 
significant degradation of dye occurred in the absence of catalyst with different initial 
pH and AY -17 solution was found to be stable on irradiation with UV and solar light 
irradiation.  
 Figure 4.24a presents the effect of pH on time course variation of percentage 
degradation of AY -17 dye under UV light irradiation. Figure 4.25a shows that, as the 
pH of AY-17 dye solution increases from 1 to 3, the degradation in 360 min of 
irradiation time increases from 41.63 to 99.2 %, but further increase in pH to 4 and 
higher, decreases the degradation, which reached to only around 0.23 % (at 360 min) 
at a pH of 9. T herefore, the highest degradation of AY -17 was observed at pH 3. 
Similar observations have been reported by other researchers in their studies on UV 
photocatalysis with TiO 2 as a photocatalyst, during the degradation of AY -17 (Liu et 
al. 2006) with maximum  degradation at pH of 3 and in the degradation of Acid 
Orange 7 (Tanaka et al. 2000) with maximum degradation at pH of  2.   
 Figure 4.24b presents the effect of pH on time course variation of percentage 
degradation of AY -17 dye under solar light irradiati on. Figure 4.25b shows that, as 
pH of the dye solution increases from 1 to 3, the degradation increases from 71 % to 
almost 100 %. But further increase in pH to 4 and higher results in decreased 
degradation. Negligible reduction was observed at pH above 6.  The highest 
degradation was observed at pH 3. Sakthivel et al. (2003a) also reported similar trends 
in their studies on effect of pH on photocatalytic degradation of Acid brown 14 using 
TiO 2 under solar light irradiation. They found that pH of 3 yields ma ximum RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 percentage degradation and at lower pH values, positively charged TiO 2 surface 
adsorbed more dye and hence more degradation was achieved.  
 pH plays multiple roles on the photocatalytic process by affecting the 
sorption –desorption processes on the sur face of the catalyst particles, electrostatic 
interactions between the catalyst surface, dye molecules, and charged radicals formed 
during the reaction process. In acidic suspensions, the adsorption of dye on the TiO 2 
surfaces is significantly higher than the extent of adsorption in neutral or alkaline 
suspensions. This is attributed to the fact that TiO 2 shows an amphoteric character so 
that either a positive or a negative charge can be developed on its surface (Sohrabi 
and Ghavami 2010). Therefore, below the point of zero charge (pzc) of TiO 2 which is 
6.8 (pH pzc), the surface of the particles is positively charged (pH <pH pzc), above this 
value it is negatively charged (pH >pH pzc) whereas it is neutral when pH = pH pzc 
(Chiou et al. 2008). Since, AY -17 is an  anionic dye with a good solubility; the sodium 
ion is easily dissociated in water and leaves the dye molecule with negative charges 
(Liu et al. 2006). Due to the charge difference between negatively charged dye 
molecules and positively charged TiO 2 shell on the catalyst, coupling between dye 
and catalyst molecules increases at lower pH, which in turn increases the electrostatic 
interactions between the photocatalyst surface and dye anions which lead to 
adsorption. Density of hydroxyl radicals increases at lower pH values; hence catalyst 
easily gets adsorbed and facilitates the reaction to proceed at lower pH value (Sohrabi 
and Ghavami 2010). In contrast, under alkaline and neutral conditions, little 
adsorption occurs on the surface of catalyst due to columb ic repulsion between the 
negatively charged catalyst and dye molecule which decreases the generation of 
hydroxyl radicals and hence decrease the photocatalytic degradation ( Chiou et al. 
2008). Therefore pH of 3 is considered as the optimum for the photocat alytic 
degradation of AY -17 under UV and solar light irradiation using Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles as catalyst.

 4.6.1.2 Effect of pH on the photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 dye under UV 
and solar light irradiation  
 
 To study the effect of pH on degradation  of RB -220 dye, photocatalytic 
degradation experiments were performed under UV and solar light irradiation with 
RB-220 at concentration of 50 mg/L in aqueous solution by varying the initial pH. 
Experiments were performed under UV light with different initi al pH ranging from 2 
to 7 and under solar light, pH ranging from 2 to 9. The catalyst loading of 1 g/L for 
UV photocatalysis and 500 mg/L for solar photocatalysis was used. Time course 
variations of RB -220 dye concentrations obtained with different initial  pH conditions 
are shown in Table 4.15 -4.16 respectively for UV and solar photocatalysis. In order to 
confirm the effect of initial pH, control experiments at different initial pH were also 
conducted under a light source (UV and solar) and in the absence o f catalyst. No 
significant degradation of RB -220 dye occurred in the absence of catalyst at different 
initial pH and RB -220 solution was found to be stable on irradiation with UV and 
solar light irradiation.  
 Figure 4.26a presents the time course variation  of effect of pH on percentage 
degradation of RB -220 dye under UV light irradiation, which shows a maximum rate 
of degradation at pH of 3. Figure 4.27a shows that, as pH of the dye solution increases 
from 2 to 3 the degradation in 240 min of irradiation ti me increases from 23.09 % to 
98.92 %, but further increase in pH to 4 and higher decreases the degradation, which 
reaches to only around 2.53 % (at 240 min) at pH of 7. The highest degradation was 
observed at a pH of 3. Soustas et al. (2009) in their studi es on photocatalytic 
degradation of reactive azo dyes using TiO 2 under UV light irradiation have also 
observed that higher degradation are achieved at low and acidic pH values, and 
maximum degradation occurs at pH of 3.  
 Similarly Figure 4.26b and Figure 4.27b present the effect of pH on time 
course variation of percentage degradation of RB -220 dye and on percentage 
degradation at 180min irradiation time respectively, under solar light irradiation. It is 
observed from Figure 4.27b, the highest rate of degr adation and percentage 
degradation (after 120 min irradiation time) occurs at a pH of 3. Maximum percentage 
degradation which occurred by solar photocatalysis at initial pH of 3 was 99.44 %. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 Effect of pH on photocatalysis of RB -220 dye can be explained on similar grounds as 
it is explained for the degradation of AY -17 dye in Section 4.6.1.1. pH of 3 is the 
optimum for the photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 under UV and solar light 
irradiation using Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles as catalyst, as is the case with AY -17dye.

 4.6.2 Effect of catalyst loading on photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -
220 dyes under UV and solar light irradiation  
 
 The efficiency of photocatalytic degradation depends on the type and 
concentration of photocatalyst and the pollutant concentration (Habibi et al. 2005), 
therefore it is necessary to find the optimum catalyst loading for the photocatalytic 
process since in  photocatalysis rate of reaction is a function of catalyst loading (San et 
al. 2002; Saquib and Munner 2002). Optimum catalyst loading will not only enhance 
the degradation efficiency, but also limit the excess usage of the catalyst and hence 
making the pr ocess economically friendlier. As a first step to determine the optimum 
catalyst loading, the effect of catalyst loading on photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 
and RB -220 under UV and solar light irradiation were studied. For UV 
photocatalysis; air was con tinuously supplied at a flow rate of 2 LPM. For solar 
photocatalysis atmospheric air served as a source for oxidant as explained in Section 
4.6.1.  
 
4.6.2.1 Effect of catalyst loading on photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 
 
To study the effect of catalyst loading, batch experiments on photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 with initial concentration of 10 mg/L in aqueous solution were 
performed in   a stirred reactor at optimum pH obtained from earlier Sections (pH=3), 
under UV and solar light irradiation, by varying the catalyst loading. Experiments 
were performed under UV light by varying the amount of catalyst from 50 mg/L to 1 
g/L and under solar light by varying the amount of catalyst from 50 to 500 mg/L. 
Time course variations of AY -17 dye concentrations obtained with different catalyst 
loadings are shown in Table 4.17 -4.18 respectively for UV and solar photocatalysis.  
 Figure 4.28a presents the effect of catalyst loading on time course variation of 
percentage degradation of AY -17 dye under UV light irrad iation and maximum rate 
of degradation is observed at catalyst loading of 300 mg/L. It can be seen from Figure 
4.29a, as the loading of the catalyst increases from 50 to 300 mg/L the percentage 
degradation (after 300 min irradiation time), increases from 1 0 to 99.94 %. The 
increase in the degradation may be attributed to the fact that, as the loading of RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
198 
 Ag@TiO 2 increases, the active sites for the adsorption of dye molecules also increase, 
which in turn increases the formation of electron and hole pairs; thu s increasing the 
formation of hydroxyl radicals and hence an enhancement in the photocatalytic 
reaction rate occurs. On the other hand, with further increase in catalyst loading from 
300 to 1000 mg/L, the percentage degradation has decreased to as low as a round 
49.18 % (after 300 min irradiation). This may be due to agglomeration (particle –
particle interaction) of particles at a higher loading, resulting in the decrease in 
surface area available for light absorption and hence, a decrease in photocatalytic 
degradation rate. Although with increase in catalyst loading the number of active sites 
in solution increases, a saturation point occurs; beyond which light penetration is 
hindered as a result of shielding effect of suspended catalyst particles. The relatio n 
between these two opposite phenomena results in an optimum catalyst loading for the 
photocatalytic degradation (Adesina 2004; Ahmed et al. 2011). The optimum amount 
of catalyst loading was found to be 300 mg/L for the degradation of AY -17 with 
initial dy e concentration of 10 mg/L. Optimum catalyst loading is a function of initial 
dye concentration. Hence dye to catalyst ratio is the more appropriate parameter in 
photocatalytic degradation applications. The optimum catalyst loading of 300 mg/L 
for 10 mg/L of dye concentration corresponds to dye to catalyst ratio of 1:30 (g/g). 
Hence the optimum dye to catalyst ratio for UV photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 
using Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles is 1:30 on weight basis.  
 Figure 4.28b presents th e effect of catalyst loading on the time course 
variation of percentage degradation of AY -17 dye and Figure 4.29b presents the effect 
on percentage degradation after 60 min irradiation time, under solar light irradiation. 
It can be seen from Figure 4.28a a nd Figure 4.29b that, the rate of degradation and 
hence the percentage degradation (after 60 min irradiation time) is the maximum at 
the catalyst loading of 100 mg/L. As the catalyst loading was increased from 50 to 
100 mg/L the percentage degradation (aft er 60 min irradiation), increased from 
around 76 to 100 %. On the other hand, with further increase in catalyst loading from 
100 to 500 mg/L, the percentage degradation has decreased to around 91 % (after 60 
min). The observed effect of catalyst loading on  the dye degradation by solar 
photocatalysis is similar to that for UV photocatalysis and the reason for the trend is 
as explained for UV photocatalysis of the dye. The optimum amount of catalyst RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 loading for solar photocatalysis is found to be 100 mg/L for  the degradation of AY -17 
with initial dye concentration of 10 mg/L. The optimum catalyst loading of 100 mg/L 
for 10 mg/L initial dye concentration corresponds to dye to catalyst ratio of 1:10 (g/g). 
Hence the optimum dye to catalyst ratio for solar photoc atalytic degradation of AY -17 
using Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles is 1:10 (g/g).  
 
4.6.2.2 Effect of catalyst loading on photocatalytic degradation of RB -220  
 
To study the effect of catalyst loading on photocatalytic degradation of RB -220, 
experiments were performed with initial concentration of 50 mg/L in aqueous solution 
at optimum pH as obtained in Section 4.6.1 (pH=3), under UV and solar light 
irradiation, by varying the catalyst loading. Experiments were performed in a batch 
stirred rea ctor under UV light by varying the amount of catalyst from 500 mg/L to 2 
g/L and under solar light, amount of catalyst ranging from 250 mg/L to 2 g/L. Time 
course variations of RB -220 dye concentrations obtained with different catalyst 
loadings are shown i n Table 4.19 -4.20 respectively for UV and solar photocatalysis. 
Figure 4.30a presents the effect of catalyst loading on time course variation of 
percentage degradation of RB -220 dye under UV light irradiation. It can be seen from 
Figure 4.31a that, as the concentration of catalyst increases from 500 mg/L to 1 g/L 
the degradation after 240 min of UV irradiation, increases from 38.17 to 98.92 %. On 
the other hand, with further increase in catalyst loading from 1 g/L to 2 g/L, the 
percentage degradation has de creased to as low as 45.91 % (after 240 min). The 
optimum amount of catalyst loading is found to be 1 g/L for the UV photocatalytic 
degradation of RB -220 with initial dye concentration of 50 mg/L. 1 g/L optimum 
catalyst loading for 50 mg/L dye concentratio n correspond to dye to catalyst ratio of 
1:20 (g/g). Hence the optimum dye to catalyst ratio for UV photocatalytic degradation 
of RB -220 using Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles is 1:20.  
 Figure 4.30b presents the effect of catalyst loading on tim e course variation of 
percentage degradation of the RB -220 dye under solar light. As the concentration of 
the catalyst was increased from 250 to 500 mg/L the degradation (after 120 min 
irradiation)   increased from 88.02 % to 99.44 % (Figure 4.31b). On the  other hand, 
with further increase in catalyst loading from 500 mg/L to 2 g/L, the percentage RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
200 
 degradation (after 120 min irradiation) decreased to around 91.97 %. So the optimum 
amount of catalyst loading for solar photocatalysis is 500 mg/L for the degrad ation of 
RB-220 with initial dye concentration of 50 mg/L. Optimum catalyst loading of 500 
mg/L for 50 mg/L dye concentration corresponds to dye to catalyst ratio of 1:10 (g/g). 
Hence the optimum dye to catalyst ratio for solar photocatalytic degradation o f RB -
220 using Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles is 1:10 (g/g).  
 The trend showing the effect of catalyst loading on UV and solar 
photocatalysis of RB -220 dye is similar to that for AY -17 dye and the reason for this 
trend is already explained in Section 4.6.2.1.

4.6.3 Effect  of initial dye concentration on photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 
and RB -220 under UV and solar light irradiation  
 
 Though dye to catalyst ratio is an important parameter governing the 
photocatalytic degradation of dyes, the initial dye concentration ma y act as an 
independent factor governing the rate of photocatalytic degradation of dyes. So in 
order to study the influence of initial dye concentration as an independent factor, 
photocatalytic degradation experiments of AY -17 and RB -220 were performed und er 
UV and solar light irradiation, by varying the initial dye concentrations and keeping 
the ratio of dye to catalyst loading constant at optimum values obtained from Section 
4.6.2.  
 
4.6.3.1 Effect of initial dye concentration on photocatalytic degradatio n of AY -17 
under UV and solar light irradiations  
 
 Experiments were performed under UV light with different initial dye 
concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 mg/L and under solar light with dye 0 20 40 60 80 100

 concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 mg/L. In case of experim ents under UV 
irradiation, dye to catalyst loading ratio was kept constant at 1:30 (g/g) whereas in 
solar photocatalysis it was kept constant at 1:10 (g/g). For example, when the initial 
concentration was 200 mg/L, the catalyst loading was 6 g/L (0.6 g/100  mL). The dye 
to catalyst loading chosen in these experiments  were the optimum values as obtained 
by crude optimization method based on “one factor at a time” experiments presented 
in Section 4.6.2. The time course variations of AY -17 dye concentrations o btained 
with different initial concentrations of the dye are presented in Table 4.21 -4.22 
respectively for UV and solar photocatalysis.  
 Figure 4.32 presents the effect of initial dye concentration on time course 
variation of photocatalytic degradation of  the dye, under constant dye to catalyst ratio 
of 1:30. It is observed, as the concentration increases from 10 mg/L to 200 mg/L, the 
percentage degradation (after 360 min irradiation time) decreases drastically from 
99.98 to 18.6 %, though the dye to catal yst ratio was kept constant. Constant dye to 
catalyst ratio indicates that the numbers of available active sites are appropriate for 
the given dye loading. In spite of enough active sites being present, the degradation 
decreased as the initial concentratio n was increased. Higher dye concentration may 
hinder the photocatalytic degradation in several ways: (i) at higher dye concentration, 
increased numbers of dye molecules present in the reactor increases the colour 
intensity of the reaction mixture, thereby hindering light penetration into the interior 
parts of the reactor. This slows down the activation of the catalysts in the interior 
parts, in spite of provision of mixing. (ii) solubility of oxygen in the reaction mixture 
may decrease by the presence of dy es at higher concentrations, hence decreasing the 
available dissolved oxygen (DO). The stored electrons in Ag core are discharged 
when an electron acceptor such as O 2 is available. Deficiency of dissolved oxygen at 
high dye concentration may slow down the release of electrons and hence the rate of 
photocatalytic process may be reduced. The decrease in DO was observed in the 
present study at high concentrations and the DO variations are presented in Table 
4.23. (iii) Table 4.23 also shows an increase in pH o f the reaction mixture with the 
progress of the reaction. Large increase in pH was observed with 200 mg/L initial dye 
concentration. When the initial concentrations are high, the reduced DO may lead to 
incomplete mineralization, which results in buildup of  intermediates in the reaction RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
206 
 mixture. The presence of intermediates would have increased the pH. As discussed in 
Section 4.6.1, acidic pH of 3 favors the photocatalytic degradation and at pH values 
above 3, decrease in dye degradation was observed. At hi gher pH of above 6.8 (pzc), 
adsorption of dye is not favored and hence the rate of photocatalysis slows down. The 
reduced photocatalytic degradation with increased dye concentration may be 
attributed also to increased pH during the reaction. Time course va riations of 
percentage degradation, shown in Figure 4.32 indicates that as the initial 
concentration is increased, the rate of photocatalysis slows down, as indicated by 
reduction in slopes of time course plots. Gradual decrease in slopes with time in the 
time course plots, indicate reduced rates, with the progress of reaction. As it is evident 
from Figure 4.32, dye to catalyst ratio of 1:30 is not favorable at high initial dye 
concentrations. So it may be concluded that dye to catalyst ratio of 1:30 may no t be 
valid throughout the wide range of concentrations. Only 66 % degradation of 100 
mg/L of dye could be attained within 360 min, with 1:30 dye to catalyst ratio and the 
ratio is not favorable even for 50 mg/L dye concentration.  
 Figure 4.33 presents the  effect of initial dye concentration on time course 
variation of solar photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 dye, under constant dye to 
catalyst ratio of 1:10. As observed from the Figure, almost 100 % degradation of 10 
and 50 mg/L dye is achieved within 120  minutes indicating the faster rates of 
degradation at low concentrations. Time course variations of percentage degradation, 
shown in Figure 4.33 indicate that as the initial concentration increases, the rate of 
photocatalysis slows down, as observed from the time course plots. As the 
concentration was increased from 10 mg/L to 500 mg/L, the percentage degradation 
(after 360 min irradiation time) decreased considerably from 99.49 to 20.42 %, 
though the dye to catalyst ratio was kept constant. Higher dye con centration may 
hinder the photocatalytic degradation as discussed previously in this section on UV 
photocatalysis of AY -17 dye. Large decrease in DO and increase in pH of the reaction 
mixture observed during the progress of the reaction is presented in Tab le 4.24. When 
the initial concentrations are high, the reduced DO may lead to incomplete 
mineralization as discussed earlier in this section on UV photocatalysis. The reduced 
photocatalytic degradation with increased dye concentration may also be attribute d to 
increased pH during the reaction. Almost 100 % degradation of 100 mg/L of dye RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
207 
 could be achieved in 360 min. But at higher concentrations above 100 mg/L, rate of 
degradation was slower and the percentage degradations were much lesser. So it may 
be conc luded that dye to catalyst ratio of 1:10 is not valid to concentrations above 100 
mg/L of initial dye concentration. Time taken to achieve almost 100 % degradation of 
100 mg/L of dye was 360 min, but for 10 and 50 mg/L, almost 100 % degradation 
with 1:10 d ye to catalyst ratio could be achieved within 120 min.  
 The rates of degradation obtained with different initial concentrations using 
catalyst loading which provides dye to catalyst ratio at the optimum obtained for 10 
mg/L of the dye, from crude optimizat ion method based on “one factor at a time 
analysis” were very low. So to check whether rate of UV and solar photocatalysis of 
AY-17 can be improved by the addition of other oxidants, further experiments were 
performed with initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L and dye to catalyst ratio of 1:30 
for UV photocatalysis and 1:10 for solar photocatalysis with different oxidants.

4.6.3.2 Effect of initial dye concentration on photocatalytic degradation of RB -
220 under UV and solar light irradiations  
  
 Experiments were performed under UV light with different initial dye 
concentrations of RB -220 ranging from 50 to 200 mg/L and under solar light with dye 
concentrations ranging from 50 to 500 mg/L. In case of experiments under UV 
irradiation, dye to catalyst loading ratio was kept constant at 1:20 (g/g) whereas in 
solar photo catalysis it was kept constant at 1:10 (g/g). The dye to catalyst loading 
ratio chosen in these experiments  were the optimum values as obtained by crude 
optimization method based on “one factor at a time” experiments presented in Section 
4.6.2. The time c ourse variations of RB -220 dye concentrations obtained with 
different initial concentrations of the dye are presented in Table 4.25 -4.26 
respectively, for UV and solar photocatalysis.

 ratio of 1:20. Almost 100 % degradation of 50 mg/L dye was achieved within 180 min 
indicating faster rates of degradation at low concentrations. Time course variati ons of 
percentage degradation, shown in Figure 4.34 indicate that as the initial concentration 
is increased, the rate of photocatalysis slows down. As the concentration was 
increased from 50 to 200 mg/L, the percentage degradation (after 360 min irradiatio n 
time) has decreased considerably from almost 100 % to 45 %, though the dye to 
catalyst ratio was kept constant. Higher dye concentration may hinder the 
photocatalytic degradation as discussed previously in section 4.6.3.1. Large decrease 
in DO and increa se in pH of the reaction mixture observed during the progress of the 
reaction are presented in Table 4.27. Decrease in DO and increase in pH during the 
course of reaction causes decrease in degradation of RB -220 dyes, as explained in 
Section 4.6.3.1 for ph otocatalysis of AY -17. Around 91% degradation of 100 mg/L of 
dye could only be achieved in 360 min. But at higher concentrations of above 100 
mg/L, degradation was much lesser. So it may be concluded that dye to catalyst ratio 
of 1:20 is not favorable to c oncentrations of 100 mg/L or more initial dye 
concentration. So, further experiments were performed with the addition of oxidants 
other than oxygen, with initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L and dye to catalyst 
loading of 1:20, to test whether the photoca talytic degradation rate can be enhanced 
by the presence of additional oxidants during the reaction.  
 Figure 4.35 presents the effect of initial dye concentration on time course 
variation of solar photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 dye under solar light 
irradiation, with constant dye to catalyst ratio of 1:10. Time course variations of 
percentage degradation, shown in Figure 4.35 indicate that as the initial concentration 
is increased, the rate of photocatalysis slows down. As the concentration was 
increa sed from 50 to 500 mg/L, the percentage degradation (after 360 min irradiation 
time) decreased considerably from almost 100 % to 39 %, though the dye to catalyst 
ratio was kept constant. It can be observed, almost 100 % degradation of 50 mg/L of 
dye is ach ieved within 120 min indicating faster rates of degradation at low 
concentrations. Higher dye concentration may hinder the photocatalytic degradation 
as discussed previously in section 4.6.3.1. Large decrease in DO and increase in pH of 
the reaction mixtur e observed during the progress of the reaction as presented in 
Table 4.28 also lead to decrease in photocatalytic degradation and the reason for this RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 trend is explained in Section 4.6.3.1. Almost 100 % degradation of 100 mg/L of dye 
could be achieved in 12 0 min and dye at concentration of 200 mg/L could be 
degraded to more than 98 % in 360 min. But at higher concentrations of 300 mg/L or 
above, degradations were much lesser. So it may be concluded that dye to catalyst 
ratio of 1:10 is not valid to concentra tions above 200 mg/L. Time taken to achieve 
almost 100 % degradation of 100 mg/L of dye was 120 min, but for 200 mg/L, it took 
around 360 min for around 98 % degradation with the same dye to catalyst ratio. So, 
further experiments were performed with initi al dye concentration of 100 mg/L and 
dye to catalyst loading of 1:10, to test whether the photocatalytic degradation rate can 
be enhanced by the presence of additional oxidants during the reaction.

4.6.4 Effect of oxidants on photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dye 
under UV and solar light irradiation  
 
Use of additional oxidants other than dissolved oxygen can have several effe cts on the 
photocatalytic degradation rate:  
(i) It can help in release of electrons from the Ag core, (ii) it can produce more 
radicals and other oxidizing species, hence increasing the degradation rate of 
intermediate compounds produced during the photocatalytic process, and (iii) it can 
prevent problems caused by decrease in oxygen concentration ( Bahnemann et al. 
2007)  
 As oxidants play an important role, many researchers have studied the effect 
of oxidants such as H 2O2, (NH 4)2S2O8, and KBrO 3 on th e photocatalytic degradation 
of different dyes ( Neppolian et al. 2002a; Qamar et al. 2005a; Qamar et al. 2005b; 
Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006a; Muruganandham and Swaminathan,

 such as H 2O2, (NH 4)2S2O8, and KBrO 3 on the UV and solar photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 using Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured 
nanoparticles were studied. In order to  check if the oxidants ( H2O2, (NH 4)2S2O8, and 
KBrO 3) themselves can lead to photolysis of the dyes , control experiments were also 
done at different concentrations of oxidants under the light source (UV and solar) and 
in the absence of catalyst. Degradation  of dyes achieved with different concentrations 
of oxidants in the absence of catalyst were insignificant as compared to those obtained 
with oxidants in the presence of catalyst indicating direct photolysis is not significant.  
 
4.6.4.1 Effect of oxidants on photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 dye  
 
(i) Effect of addition of H 2O2 on UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 
 
Hydroxyl radical is responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes, so 
hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant in concentration range of 5-20 mM, was added 
initially to the aqueous dye solution of 100 mg/L concentration and with initial pH of 
3, for UV and solar photocatalysis. In case of UV photocatalysis, catalyst loading of 3 
g/L and for solar photocatalysis, catalyst loading of 1 g/L wa s used. These catalyst 
loadings provided dye to catalyst ratio of 1:30 (g/g) and 1:10 (g/g) respectively for 
UV and solar photocatalysis. The experiments with H 2O2 addition were conducted in 
the absence of air supply. The time course variations of AY -17 dy e concentrations 
obtained with different concentrations of H 2O2 are presented in Table 4.29 -4.30 
respectively for UV and solar photocatalysis.  
 Figure 4.36a presents the time course variation of percentage degradation of 
AY-17 during UV photocatalysis in the presence of H 2O2 as an oxidant. Less than 
around 77 % degradation could only be achieved in 360 min irradiation time with any 
concentration of H 2O2. Figure 4.37a shows the comparison of the percentage 
degradation (after 60 min irradiation) achieved usi ng only air and different 
concentrations of H 2O2 as oxidants. The results showed that the percentage 
degradation achieved using H 2O2 as an oxidant was higher than that achieved with air. 
The percentage degradation increased from 20.5 to 23.6 % as the conce ntration of 
H2O2 increased in the range of 5 -10 mM, but further increase in H 2O2 concentration to RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
217 
 20 mM decreased the degradation to about 10.59 %. It was also observed from Figure 
4.36a, rate of degradation of AY -17 is the highest when 10 mM H 2O2 was adde d as 
compared to addition of H 2O2 at other concentrations. So 10 mM H 2O2 was found to 
be the optimum for the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 under UV light 
irradiation.  
 Similar experiments were conducted using hydrogen peroxide in concentration 
range of 10 -20 mM as oxidant for solar photocatalysis of dye solution of 100 mg/L 
concentration with catalyst loading of 1 g/L and with initial pH of 3. Figure 4.36b 
presents the time course variation of percentage degradation of AY -17, with the 
addition of H 2O2 during solar photocatalysis. Almost 100 % degradation could be 
achieved in 360 min irradiation time with 10 mM H 2O2, but with addition of H 2O2 at 
other concentrations, complete degradation was not possible in 360 min. Figure 4.37b 
shows percentage degrada tion (after 60 min irradiation time) achieved by using H 2O2 
as an oxidant at different concentrations. The results show that the percentage 
degradation achieved with H 2O2 as an oxidant is higher than that achieved without the 
addition of H 2O2. Further it is observed, as the concentration of H 2O2 increases from 5 
to 10 mM, degradation increases from around 68.7 % to 73.23 %, but further increase 
in H 2O2 concentration to greater than 10 mM causes decrease in degradation, reaching 
to about 34.73 % at 20 mM. I t is observed from the Figure 4.36b, rate of degradation 
of AY -17 is the highest with 10 mM H 2O2 addition, as compared to addition of H 2O2 
at other concentrations. So 10 mM H 2O2 is the optimum for the photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 under solar light i rradiation.  
 The increase in degradation by addition of H 2O2 is due to increase in the 
hydroxyl radical concentration by the following ways  (Muruganandham and 
Swaminathan, 2004, 2006 a,b):  
(i) Direct reaction with conduction band (CB) electrons and thus i nhibiting the 
electron –hole recombination (ii) indirect reaction with superoxide radical anion 
(Pichat et al. 1995).  
 But at high H 2O2 concentration of above 10 mM, the percentage degradation 
decreases with increase in H 2O2 concentration due to:(i) Scaveng ing effect of 
hydroxyl radical ( Sarthy and Mohseni 2006). Excess of H 2O2 reacts with hydroxyl 
radical (•OH) and forms hydroperoxy radical (HO 2•). These hydroperoxy radicals RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
218 
 (HO 2•) are very less reactive than the hydroxyl radical (•OH) and do not contribute  to 
oxidative degradation of dye (ii) when H 2O2 is present in excess quantity, it may act 
as hole scavenger ( Pichat et al. 1995) . In photocatalytic degradation, the positive hole 
either oxidizes dye directly or it reacts with water to produce hydroxyl radi cal. Hence, 
the degradation of hole decreases the dye degradation rate.  
 In the present study, maximum dye degradation occurred with the addition of 
10 mM (340 mg/L) H 2O2. Hence , 10 mM H 2O2 was found to be the optimum 
concentration for photocatalytic degra dation of AY -17 using Ag@TiO 2 core shell 
structured nanoparticles under UV and solar light irradiation.

(ii) Effect of addition of ammonium persulphate [ (NH 4)2S2O8] as an oxidant for UV 
and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 
 
Effect of addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 as an oxidant was studied with dye solution of 100 
mg/L concentration and with initial pH = 3 by varying the concentration of 
(NH 4)2S2O8 from 1 to 4 g/L for the  photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 under UV 
and solar light irradiation . In case of UV photoca talysis, catalyst loading of 3 g/L and 
for solar photocatalysis, a catalyst loading of 1 g/L was used. The dye to catalyst ratio 
was hence maintained at 1:30 for UV and 1:10 for solar photocatalysis. The 
experiments with (NH 4)2S2O8 addition were conducted in the absence of air supply. 
The time course variations of AY -17 dye concentrations obtained with different

  Figure 4.38a presents the time course  variation of percentage degradation of 
AY-17 during UV photocatalysis with addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 at different 
concentrations. Almost 100 % degradation of AY -17 could be achieved in 30 min 
irradiation with the addition of 2 g/L and 3 g/L of  (NH 4)2S2O8. But with other 
concentrations of (NH 4)2S2O8, complete degradation could not be achieved even after 
120 min of irradiation. The effect of addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 (1-4 g/L ) on 
photocatalytic degradation of the dye after 60 min irradiation time is shown in Figure 
4.39a. As seen from the results, higher degradation was achieved with (NH 4)2S2O8, as 
compared to that with air as an oxidant. Tremendous increase in the rate of 
degradation was observed on the addition of (NH 4)2S2O8. As the concentration of 
(NH 4)2S2O8 was increased from 1 to 2 g/L, degradation at the end of 60 min increased 
from 92.4 to 98.96 %, whereas only around 12.8 % (degradation) was achieved using 
air as the source of oxidant. Though degradation remained almost constant, when 
(NH 4)2S2O8 was in creased from 2 to 3 g/L, further increase in its concentration to 4 
g/L resulted in reduction in degradation from 97.6 to 95.54 %. It is observed from 
Figure 4.38a, 2 g/L (NH 4)2S2O8 is the optimum for the photocatalytic degradation of 
AY-17 under UV light,  owing to achievement of maximum degradation of the dye.  
 Similar experiments were conducted using (NH 4)2S2O8 in concentration range 
of 1-4 g/L as an oxidant with AY -17 dye solution of 100 mg/L concentration and 
catalyst loading of 1 g/L with initial pH of  3 under solar light irradiation. Figure 4.38b 
presents the time course variation of percentage degradation of AY -17 with addition 
of (NH 4)2S2O8 during solar photocatalysis. Almost 100 % degradation of AY -17 could 
be achieved in 30 min irradiation with the  addition of 2 g/L and 3 g/L of  (NH 4)2S2O8. 
But with other concentrations of (NH 4)2S2O8, complete degradation could not be 
achieved even after 120 min of irradiation.  The effect of addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 (1-4 
g/L) on photocatalytic degradation of dye after 60 min irradiation time is shown in 
Figure 4.39b. Results show that higher degradation could be achieved with the 
addition of (NH 4)2S2O8. The rate of degradation has increased considerably on the 
addition of (NH 4)2S2O8. By the addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 as oxidant at concentration of 
1 g/L, the percentage degradation at 60 min irradiation time has increased to 94.5 %, 
whereas only 60.05 % degradation was achieved without the addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 . 
As the concentration of (NH 4)2S2O8 increased from 1 to 2  g/L, degradation after 60 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
222 
 min of irradiation time has increased from 94.5 % to almost 99.29 %. Further increase 
in its concentration to 3 and 4 g/L, did not alter the percentage degradation. It is 
observed from Figure 4.38b, 2 g/L (NH 4)2S2O8 is the optimu m for the photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 under solar light.  
          The increase in degradation in the presence of persulphate ion is due to the 
following facts:  
 Persulphate ion can trap the conduction band electron and results in the 
formation of  sulphate radical ion (SO 4.−) which is a powerful oxidizing agent, can add 
hydrogen to the unsaturated carbon, subtracts hydrogen from the saturated carbon or it 
can remove electrons from the carboxylate anion and from certain neutral molecules 
of dye ( Nasr et al.1997; Neppolian et al. 2002b). In addition, SO 4.− can trap the 
conduction band electrons and/or generate hydroxyl radical ( Pelizzetti et al. 1991; 
Minero et al. 1993; Nasr et al. 1997). This unique nature of SO 4.− increases the 
fragmentation of the dye molecules by attacking at various positions (Neppolian et al. 
2002b) and can result in the enhancement of degradation rate.  
 At a high concentration of persulphate, excess of sulphate radical anion 
(SO 42.−) may get adsorbed on Ag@TiO 2 surface and d eactivate a section of catalyst 
there by inhibiting the degradation process or may also react with photogenerated 
holes and with hydroxyl radicals ( Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006b). SO 42.− 
being  less reactive than •OH radical and h+, thus in excess may reduce the 
photodegradation of the dye. But in the present studies, the excess persulphate did not 
yield significant reduction in percentage degradation, indicating that inhibition effect 
is negligible in the concentration range studie d. As high rate and almost complete 
degradation of AY -17 was observed with 2 g/L of (NH 4)2S2O8, it may be considered 
as the optimum for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17.

 (iii) Effect of addition of KBrO 3 as oxidant for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -
17 
 
Effect of addition of KBrO 3 as an oxidant for photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 
under UV and solar light irradiation  was studied with the dye solution of 100 mg/L 
concentration and initial pH = 3 by varying the concentration of KBrO 3 from 1 to 4 
g/L. In case of UV photocatalysis, catalyst loading of 3 g/L and in solar 
photocatalysis, catalyst loading of 1 g/L was used. The experiments with KBrO 3 
addition were conducted in the absence of air supply. The time course variations of 
AY-17dye concentrations obtained with different concentrations of KBrO 3 are 
presented in Table 4.33 -4.34 respectively for UV and solar photocatal ysis.  
 Figure 4.40a presents the effect of addition of KBrO 3 on the time course 
variation of percentage degradation of AY -17 during UV photocatalysis. Complete 
degradation of AY -17 could not be achieved with any concentration of KBrO 3. The 
effect of addit ion of KBrO 3 (1-4 g/L ) on UV photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 
after 60 min irradiation time, is shown in Figure 4.41a. Figure 4.41a also shows the 
data point indicating the percentage degradation achieved after 60 min, with air as the 
source of oxidant.  Addition of KBrO 3 resulted in higher degradation as compared to 
that with air as the source of oxidant. As the KBrO 3 concentration was increased from 
1 to 2 g/L, the degradation (after 60 min of irradiation time) was found to increase 
from 28.2 to 34.56 % , but further increase in KBrO 3 concentration to 3 g/L or above, 
decreased the degradation. So, 2 g/L of KBrO 3 is the optimum for the photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 under UV light irradiation.  
 Similar experiments were conducted using KBrO 3as an oxida nt in 
concentration range of 1 -4 g/L for solar photocatalysis of dye solution of 100 mg/L 
concentration with catalyst loading of 1 g/L and with initial pH of 3. Figure 4.40b 
presents the time course variation of percentage degradation of AY -17 with additio n 
of KBrO 3 under solar light irradiation. Almost 100 % degradation of AY -17 could be 
achieved in 360 min irradiation with the addition of 2 g/L of KBrO 3, whereas  with 
other concentrations of KBrO 3, complete degradation could not be achieved even after 
360 min of irradiation.  The effect of addition of KBrO 3 (1-4 g/L) on photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 after 60 min irradiation time is shown in Figure 4.41b. The RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
226 
 Figure also presents the percentage degradation without the addition of KBrO 3. As 
shown in Figu re 4.41b, the addition of KBrO 3 leads to higher degradation of the dye. 
As the concentration of KBrO 3 was  increased from 1 to 2 g/L, degradation after 60 
min of irradiation time increased from around 70.72 % to 78.06 %, but further 
increase in concentration of KBrO 3 to 3 g/L and above, has decreased the degradation. 
So, 2 g/L of KBrO 3 was found to be optimum f or the photocatalytic degradation of 
AY-17 under solar light irradiation.  
 The increase in degradation rate with the addition of KBrO 3 is owing to its 
electron scavenging effect by the reaction between conduction band electron and 
BrO 3− ion as shown in Eq. (4.1).  
BrO 3− + 6e−
(CB) + 6H+→ Br− + 3H2O               (4.1)  
The decrease in the degradation rate with further increase in concentration of KBrO 3 
may be due to the adsorption of Br− ion on Ag@TiO 2 surface, which affects the 
catalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 (Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2004, 2006 a, b).  
 In the present study, maximum dye degradation occurred with the addition of 
2 g/L KBrO 3. Hence 2 g/L KBrO 3 concentration is found to be the optimum for 
photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 using Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured 
nanoparticles under UV and solar light irradiation.

(iv) Comparison of the oxidants on UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17  
 
It is evident from the results on effect of oxidants discussed in earlier parts of this 
Section  that the optimum concentration of oxidants on UV and solar  photocatalysis 
of AY -17 dye are 10 mM (0.34 g/L)  of H 2O2, 2 g/L of (NH 4)2S2O8 and 2 g/L of 
KBrO 3 when these compounds are used as oxidants. Figure 4.42 shows the time 
course variation of percentage degradation of AY -17 dye with different oxidants at 
their optimum concentrations obtained by UV and solar photocatalysis. It is evident 
that the rate of photocatalysis is the maximum when (NH 4)2S2O8 is used as the oxidant 
and is the least when air is used as a source of oxygen to serve as an oxidant, as is 
evident from the slopes of time course plots. Rate of degradation and maximum 
degradation are lower with H 2O2 and KBrO 3 as compared to (NH 4)2S2O8. When air 
was used as the oxidant for UV photocatalysis, only around 7.34 %, 12.8 % and 19.07 
% of degradation of dye could be achieved after 30, 60 or 120 min, respectively, 
indicating the least rate of reaction as compared to photocatalysis with other ox idants. 0 10 20 30 40

 In case of solar light, when atmospheric air was used as the source of oxidant, only 
around 34.47 % and 60.05 % of degradation of dye could be achieved after 30 or 60 
min, respectively, indicating the least rate of reaction as compared to photocata lysis 
with other oxidants.  Figure 4.43 shows the comparison of different oxidants in UV 
and solar photocatalysis of AY -17. (NH 4)2S2O8 is a very effective oxidant as 
compared to others used in this study. Maximum degradation of almost around 100 % 
was achi eved within 60 min both under UV and solar light, when (NH 4)2S2O8 was 
used as the oxidant at an optimum concentration of 2 g/L. Percentage degradations 
achieved with optimum concentration of H 2O2 (10 mM or 0.34 g/L) and KBrO 3 (2 
g/L) as oxidants were only around 23.6 % and 34.56 % respectively after 60 min of 
irradiation time under UV light. In solar light, percentage degradations achieved with 
optimum concentration of H 2O2 (10 mM or 0.34 g/L) and KBrO 3 (2 g/L) as oxidants 
were only around 73.23 % and 78.06  % respectively after 60 min of irradiation time. 
Although the optimum concentration of H 2O2 (10 mM or 340 mg/L) is much lower 
than that for (NH 4)2S2O8, the rate of reaction is very slow with H2O2. The order of 
activity of oxidants is (NH 4)2S2O8>KBrO 3> H 2O2> air for UV and solar 
photocatalysis . The difference in their activities is due to the differences in the 
absorption of light which depends on the one -electron reduction potentials of different 
species (Irmak et al. 2004; Sobana et al. 2008). The one -electron reduction potentials 
for O 2, H 2O2, KBrO 3, and (NH 4)2S2O8 are: E (O 2/O2•-) = - 155 mV , E (H 2O2/OH•) = 
800 mV, E (BrO 3-/BrO 2•) = 1150 mV and E (S 2O82-/SO 4-) = 1100 mV (Wardman 
1989; Faisal et al. 2007) respectively. So from the thermodynamic point of view, all 
the oxidants should be more efficient than molecular oxygen. Experimental 
observations showed that (NH 4)2S2O8 may increase the release of stored elect rons 
from Ag core and also lead to generation of sulphate radicals along with hydroxyl 
radicals, which played a great role in increasing the photocatalytic degradation of AY -
17 both under UV and solar light irradiation, and hence (NH 4)2S2O8 (2 g/L) was fou nd 
to be the best oxidant as compared to other oxidants studies here, for the 
photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 under UV and solar light irradiation.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 4.6.4.2 Effect of oxidants on photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 dye  
 
(i) Effect of addition of H 2O2 as an oxidant on UV and solar photocatalysis of RB -
220 
  
To study the effect of addition of H2O2 as an oxidant for photocatalytic degradation of 
RB-220 dye, hydrogen peroxide in concentration range of 10 -40 mM, was added to 
the dye solution of 100 mg/L concentration, with initial pH of 3 and batch 
experiments we re conducted under UV light and solar light irradiation. In case of UV 
photocatalysis, catalyst loading of 2 g/L and for solar photocatalysis, catalyst loading 
of 1 g/L was used. This has provided dye to catalyst ratio of 1:20 and 1:10 for UV and 
solar pho tocatalysis respectively. The experiments with H 2O2 addition were 
conducted in the absence of air supply. The time course variations of RB -220 dye 
concentrations obtained with different concentrations of H 2O2 are presented in Table 
4.35-4.36 respectively f or UV and solar photocatalysis.  
 Figure 4.44a presents the time course variation of percentage degradation of 
RB-220 with H 2O2 as an oxidant for photocatalysis under UV light. Figure 4.45a 
shows the comparison of the percentage degradation (after 30 min i rradiation) 
achieved by using air as the oxidant, with that achieved by using H 2O2 at different 
concentrations as the oxidant. The results show that the percentage degradation 
achieved by photocatalysis aided by H 2O2 as an oxidant was higher (68.17 %) than  
that achieved with air (22.54 %) as the oxidant. Further, as the concentration of H 2O2 
increased from 10 to 20 mM, degradation increased from 68.17 to 77.75 %, but 
further increase in H 2O2 concentration to greater than 20 mM lead to decrease in 
degradatio n, which reached to about 61.69 % at 40 mM.  The rate of degradation of 
RB-220 was the highest when 20 mM H 2O2 was added as compared to addition of 
H2O2 at other concentrations. Almost 100 % degradation occurred in 180 min with 20 
mM H 2O2, whereas with oth er concentrations of H2O2, complete degradation could 
not be achieved in 180 min. So 20 mM H 2O2 was found to be the optimum for the 
photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 under UV light irradiation.  
 Similar experiments were conducted using hydrogen peroxide in concentration 
range of 10 -40 mM as oxidant for solar photocatalysis of the dye solution of 100 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 mg/L concentration with catalyst loading of 1 g/L and with initial pH of 3. Figure 
4.44b presents t he time course variation of percentage degradation of RB -220 by solar 
photocatalysis with H 2O2 as oxidant. The percentage degradation (after 30 min 
irradiation time) achieved by using H 2O2 as an oxidant at different concentrations are 
shown in Figure 4.45b . The results show that the percentage degradation achieved 
with H 2O2 as an oxidant is higher than that achieved without the addition of H 2O2. 
Further it is observed , with the increase in concentration of H 2O2 from 10 -20 mM, 
degradation increased from 81. 06 % to 90 %, but further increase in H 2O2 
concentration to greater than 20 mM lead to decrease in degradation, reaching about 
65.63 % at 40 mM.  As observed in Figure 4.44b, the rate of degradation of RB -220 is 
the highest with 20 mM H 2O2 addition, as com pared to addition of H 2O2 at other 
concentrations. With the addition of 20 mM H2O2, almost 100 % degradation 
occurred within 45 min, but with other concentrations of H2O2, it took more than 90 
min to achieve the similar degradation. So 20 mM H 2O2 is the op timum for the 
photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 under solar light irradiation.  
 The increase in degradation by addition of H 2O2 upto 20 mM is due to 
increase in the   hydroxyl radical concentration as explained in Section 4.6.4.1. But at 
high H 2O2 conc entration of above 20 mM, the percentage degradation decreased with 
increase in H 2O2 concentration and the reason for the same is already discussed in 
Section 4.6.4.1(i).  
 In the present study, maximum dye degradation and faster rate of degradation 
occurred with the addition of 20 mM (0.68 g/L) H 2O2. Hence , 20 mM H 2O2 was found 
to be the optimum concentration for photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 using 
Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured nanoparticles under UV and solar light irradiation.

 (ii) Effect of addition of ammonium persulphate [ (NH 4)2S2O8] as an oxidant on UV 
and solar photocatalysis of RB -220 
 
Effect of addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 as an oxidant was studied with RB -220 dye solution 
of 100 mg/L concentration and with initial pH = 3, by v arying the concentration of 
(NH 4)2S2O8 from 1 to 2.5 g/L for the  photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 under UV 
and solar light irradiation . In case of UV light experiments, catalyst loading of 2 g/L 
and for solar light experiments, catalyst loading of 1 g/L was used. The dye to catalyst 
ratio was hence maintained at 1:20 for UV and 1:10 for solar experiments. The 
experiments with (NH 4)2S2O8 addition were conducted in the absence of air supply. 
The time course variations of RB -220 dye concentrations obtained with different 
concentrations of (NH 4)2S2O8 are presented in Table 4.37 and 4.38 respectively for 
UV and solar photocatalysis.  
 Figure 4.4 6a presents the time course variation of percentage degradation of 
RB-220 under UV light,  with addition of (NH 4)2S2O8. Almost 100 % degradation of 
RB-220 occurred in 30 min with the addition of 1.5 g/L of (NH 4)2S2O8, but to achieve 
similar degradations mor e than 60 min were required with other concentrations of 
(NH 4)2S2O8. The effect of addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 (1-2.5 g/L ) on photocatalytic 
degradation of the dye after 30 min irradiation time is shown in Figure 4.47a. Results 
show that higher percentage degra dation of the dye could be achieved with 
(NH 4)2S2O8 as the oxidant, as compared to air as the oxidant. The rate of degradation 
has increased tremendously on the addition of (NH 4)2S2O8. 88.45 % degradation was 
achieved with (NH 4)2S2O8, whereas only around 22.54 % degradation was achieved 
with air as the oxidant. As the concentration of (NH 4)2S2O8 increased from 1 to 1.5 
g/L, degradation (after 30 min of irradiation time) has increased from 88.45 to 99.01 
%. Further increase in its conc entration from 2 to 2.5 g/L resulted in decrease in dye 
degradation from 83.94% to 76.83 %. As observed from Figure 4.46a, the addition of 
1.5 g/L (NH 4)2S2O8 resulted in maximum degradation of the dye and hence 1.5 g/L 
(NH 4)2S2O8 is the optimum for the pho tocatalytic degradation of RB -220 under UV 
light, owing to achievement of maximum degradation of the dye.   
 Similar experiments were conducted using (NH 4)2S2O8 in concentration range 
of 1 to 2.5 g/L as the oxidant with dye solution of 100 mg/L concentrati on and RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 catalyst loading of 1 g/L with initial pH of 3 under solar light irradiation. Figure 4.46b 
presents the time course variation of percentage degradation of RB -220 with addition 
of (NH 4)2S2O8 during solar photocatalysis. Almost 100 % degradation of RB -220 
occurred in 15 min with the addition of 1.5 g/L of (NH 4)2S2O8, but to achieve similar 
degradations more than 30 min were required with other concentrations of 
(NH 4)2S2O8. The effect of addition of (NH 4)2S2O8 (1-2.5 g/L ) on photocatalytic 
degradation of the dye after 30 min irradiation time is shown in Figure 4.47b. Results 
show that higher dye degradation could be achieved on addition of (NH 4)2S2O8, as 
compared to that without its addition. The rate of degradation has increased 
tremendously on the add ition of (NH 4)2S2O8. 99.72 % degradation was achieved with 
(NH 4)2S2O8, whereas only around 68.66 % degradation was achieved in the absence 
of (NH 4)2S2O8. As the concentration of (NH 4)2S2O8 increased from 1 to1.5 g/L, 
degradation of RB -220 (after 30 min of irradiation time) increased from 99.72 to 
99.79 %. Further increase in its concentration to 2 g/L and above has resulted in 
decrease in degradation. As observed from Figure 4.47b, 1.5 g/L (NH 4)2S2O8 is the 
optimum for the photocatalytic degradation of RB-220 under solar light. The reasons 
for increase in degradation in the presence of persulphate ion have been discussed 
previously in Section 4.6.4.1.  
 At a high concentration of persulphate, excess of sulphate radical anion 
(SO 42−) may get adsorbed on Ag @TiO 2 surface and deactivate a section of catalyst 
leading to decreased dye degradation as explained in Section 4.6.4.1. As high rate and 
almost complete degradation of RB -220 was observed with 1.5 g/L of (NH 4)2S2O8, it 
may be considered as the optimum for  UV and solar photocatalysis of RB -220.

 (iii) Effect of addition of KBrO 3 as an oxidant on UV and solar photocatalysis of 
RB-220 
 
 Effect of addition of KBrO 3 as an oxidant for photocatalytic degradation of 
RB-220 was studied with the dye solution of 100 mg/L concentration and with initial 
pH = 3, by varying the concentration of KBrO 3 from 2 to 6 g/L under UV light and 1 
to 4 g/L under solar light irradiation. In case of UV photocatalysis, catalyst loading of 
2 g/L and in solar photocatalysis, catalyst loading of 1 g/L was used. The time course 
variations of RB -220 dye concentrations obtained with different concentrations of 
KBrO 3 are presented in Table 4.39 -4.40 respectively, for UV and solar photocatalysis.  
 Figure 4.48a presents the effect of addition of KBrO 3 on the time course 
variat ion of percentage degradation of RB -220. 100 % degradation could not be 
achieved with the addition of KBrO 3 at any concentrations, even after 180 min 
irradiation time. The effect of addition of KBrO 3 (2-6 g/L ) on photocatalytic 
degradation of RB -220 after 30 min irradiation time is shown in Figure 4.49a. Figure 
4.49a also shows the data point indicating the percentage degradation achieved after 
30 min, with air as the oxidant. As observed from Figure 4.49a, the addition of KBrO 3 
leads to higher degradation of the dye, as compared to that with air as an oxidant. As 
the concentration of KBrO 3 increased from 2 to 4 g/L, degradation (after 30 min of 
irradiation time)  has increased from 26.9 to 34.51 %,  but further increase in 
concentration of KBrO 3 from 4 to 6  g/L, has decreased the degradation to around 8.45 
%. So, 4 g/L of KBrO 3 was found to be the optimum for the photocatalytic 
degradation of RB -220 under UV light irradiation.  
 Similar experiments were conducted using KBrO 3 as an oxidant in 
concentration range of 1 -4 g/L for photocatalysis of RB -220 dye solution of 100 mg/L 
concentration with catalyst loading of 1 g/L and with initial pH of 3 under solar light. 
Figure 4.48b presents the time course variation of percentage degradation of RB -220 
with additio n of KBrO 3 under solar light irradiation. Almost complete degradation 
could be achieved in 45 min irradiation time when 2 g/L of KBrO 3 was added. But 
with the addition of KBrO 3 in other concentrations, irradiation for 60 min or higher 
was required, dependi ng on the concentration of KBrO 3 added. The effect of addition 
of KBrO 3 (1-4 g/L) on photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 after 30 min irradiation RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 time is shown in Figure 4.49b. It can be observed from Figure 4.49b, addition of 
KBrO 3 lead to higher degrada tion of dye. As the concentration of KBrO 3increased 
from 1 to 2 g/L, degradation (at 30 min of irradiation time) has increased from 78.94 
to 87.04 %, but further increase in concentration of KBrO 3from 2 to 4 g/L, decreased 
the degradation from 58.38 to 38. 10 %. So 2 g/L of KBrO 3 was found to be optimum 
for the photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 under solar light irradiation.  
 The increase of the degradation rate by the addition of KBrO 3 upto 2 g/L is 
due to its electron scavenging effect as explained in S ection 4.6.4.1. The decrease in 
the degradation rate at higher concentrations of KBrO 3 may be due to the adsorption 
of Br− ion on Ag@TiO 2 surface as mentioned previously in Section 4.6.4.1.  
 In the present study, in case of UV photocatalysis maximum dye de gradation 
occurred with the addition of 4 g/L KBrO 3 and in case of solar photocatalysis, 
maximum dye degradation oc curred with the addition of 2 g/L KBrO 3. Hence 4 g/L 
and 2 g/L KBrO 3 concentrations were found to be the optimum for photocatalytic 
degradat ion of RB -220 using Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured nanoparticles under UV 
and solar light irradiation respectively.

(iv) Comparison of the effect of oxidants for UV and solar photocatalysis of RB -220 
 
It is evident from the results on effect of oxidants discussed in previous part Section 
4.6.4.2 that, the optimum concentration of oxidants for UV photocatalysis of RB -220 
dye are 20 mM (0.68 g/L) of H 2O2, 1.5 g/L of (NH 4)2S2O8 and 4 g/L of KBrO 3 and for 
solar photocatalysis viz. 20 mM (0.68 g/L) of H 2O2, 1.5 g/L of (NH 4)2S2O8 and 2 g/L 
of KBrO3 when these compounds are used as oxidants. Figure 4.50 shows the time 
course variation of percentage degradation of RB -220 dye with different oxidants at 
their optimum concentrations obtained by UV and solar photocatalysis. The rate of 
photocatalysis i s the maximum when (NH 4)2S2O8 was used as the oxidant and was the 
least when air was used as a source of oxygen as oxidant, as is evident from the slopes 
of time course plots. Rate of degradation and maximum degradation are lower with 
H2O2 and KBrO 3 as com pared to (NH 4)2S2O8. When air was used as the oxidant under 
UV light, only around 22.54 %, 32.32 % and 46.13 % of degradation of dye could be 
achieved after 30, 60 or 120 min, respectively, indicating the least rate of reaction as 0 10 20 30 40

 compared to photocatalysis with other oxidants. In case of solar light, when 
atmospheric  air was used as the oxidant source, only around 54.30 %, 68.66 % and 
89.71 % of degradation of dye could be achieved after 15, 30 or 60 min, respectively, 
indicating t he least rate of reaction as compared to photocatalysis with other oxidants.  
Figure 4.51 shows the comparison of different oxidants in UV and solar 
photocatalysis of RB -220. (NH 4)2S2O8 is a very effective oxidant as compared to 
others used in this study. Maximum degradation of almost around 100 % was 
achieved within 30 min in case of UV light and 15 min in case of solar light, when 
(NH 4)2S2O8 was used as the oxidant at an optimum concentration of 1.5 g/L. 
Percentage degradations achieved with optimum conce ntration of H 2O2 (20 mM) and 
KBrO 3 (4 g/L) as oxidants were only around 77.75 % and 34.51 % respectively after 
30 min of irradiation time under UV light. In solar light, percentage degradations 
achieved with optimum concentration of H 2O2 (20 mM) and KBrO 3 (2 g/L) as 
oxidants were only around 71.06 % and 63.80 % respectively after 15 min of 
irradiation time. Although the optimum concentration of H 2O2 (20 mM or 680 mg/L) 
is much lower than that for (NH 4)2S2O8, the rate of reaction is very slow with H2O2. 
The order of activity of oxidants is (NH 4)2S2O8>H2O2>KBrO 3> air under UV and 
solar light . The difference in their activities is due to the differences in the absorption 
of light as discussed in Section 4.6.4.1. Experimental observations showed that 
(NH 4)2S2O8 may increase the release of stored electrons from Ag core and also lead to 
generation of sulphate radicals as explained in Section 4.6.4.1. Hence (NH 4)2S2O8 (1.5 
g/L) was found to be the best oxidant as compared to other oxidants studies here, for 
the pho tocatalytic degradation of RB -220 under UV and solar light irradiation.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 4.7 Feasibility of reuse of Ag@TiO 2 catalyst for repeated photocatalysis of AY -17 
and RB -220 dyes  
 
In order to check for any loss of activity of the catalyst and feasibility of reuse of 
Ag@TiO 2 catalyst for repeated photocatalysis, experiments were carried out with 
aqueous dye solution containing 50 mg/L AY -17, catalyst loading of 1.5 g/L and  at 
pH 3 unde r UV irradiation with air as an oxidant. For solar photocatalysis, AY -17 dye 
concentration of 100 mg/L, catalyst loading of 1 g/L and pH of 3 were used. Similarly 
for photocatalysis of RB -220 dye, experiments were carried out with aqueous dye 
solution cont aining 50 mg/L of RB -220 with a catalyst loading of 1 g/L, at initial pH 
3 under UV irradiation, with air as an oxidant and in case of solar photocatalysis, 
experiments were carried out with 50 mg/L concentration of RB -220, with a catalyst 
loading of 500 m g/L and initial pH=3. After completion of experiment with a fresh 
catalyst (cycle I), the Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles at the end of cycle I was collected, 
regenerated and then utilized for the next set of experiments. So Ag@TiO 2 was reused 
thrice and totally fou r experiments were done for each dye, out of which the first 
cycle was with the fresh catalyst and the remaining three cycles were with the 
recycled catalyst. Similar experimental conditions were used for all the four cycles. 
The method for regeneration of  catalyst for the next cycle is presented in Section 
3.8.1.  
 The % degradation of AY -17 by UV and solar photocatalysis after 360 min of 
irradiation, using fresh catalyst particles (Cycle I), particles of single prior use (Cycle 
II), particles of two prior  uses (Cycle III), and particles of three prior uses (Cycle IV) 
are presented in Table 4.41. After three cycles of reuse, decrease in photocatalytic 
activity from around 85.36 to 81.50 % was observed under UV light irradiation and 
from 96.90 to 93.35 % und er solar light irradiation. The reduction in activity was 
found to be only around 5 % by UV photocatalysis and 3 % in case of solar 
photocatalysis after three cycles of reuse in terms of the degradation of AY -17.  
 The % degradation of RB -220 using fresh p articles (Cycle I), particles of 
single prior use (Cycle II), particles of two prior uses (Cycle III), and particles of 
three prior uses (Cycle IV) after 240 min of irradiation for UV and 60 min of 
irradiation for solar photocatalysis are given in Table 4. 42. After three cycles of reuse, RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
246 
 decrease in photocatalytic activity from around 98.92 to 96.36 % was observed under 
UV light irradiation (240 min) and from 99.02 to 97.14 % under solar light irradiation 
(60 min). The reduction in activity in terms of RB -220 degradation was found to be 
less than 4 % by UV photocatalysis and less than 2 % by solar photocatalysis after 
three cycles of reuse. So it can be concluded that Ag@TiO 2 can be recycled without 
much decline in activity and can be used for the photocatal ysis of dyes using UV and 
solar irradiation. So it can be concluded that Ag@TiO 2 can be recycled without much 
decline in activity.

 4.8 Optimization of parameters for AY -17 and RB -220 dye degradation by 
photocatalysis using Ag@TiO 2 under UV and solar light irradiation using 
Response surface methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design 
(CCD)  
 
 The most common goals for optimization of dye degradation process are, 
minimizing the cost (Fu et al. 2007). This will eliminate the bl ind usage of 
unnecessary components and therefore ease the process and thereby reduce the cost of 
the process. Most important of all these is that, optimization will enhance the 
efficiency of the process by increasing the rate. It was reported that the com plexities 
and uncertainties associated with large -scale processes usually come from a lack of 
knowledge of the sophisticated interactions among various factors affecting the 
process (Liu et al. 2005b). Unfortunately, classical ‘one factor at a time’ method  for 
optimization frequently fails to locate the region of optimum response because the 
joint effects of factors on the response are not taken into account in such approach. 
These approaches are also time consuming and require many a number of experiments 
to determine optimum levels, which may be unreliable. These limitations of a 
classical method can be eliminated by optimizing all the process parameters 
collectively by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) using statistical experimental 
design . In the curren t study, once the variables having the greatest influence on the 
AY-17 and RB -220 dye degradation were identified based on literature, classical ‘one 
factor at a time” method was followed as discussed in Section 4.6.1 to 4.6.4 to 
determine the effects of t hese variables. Section 4.6.1 to 4.6.4 presented the studies on 
effect of different variables on photocatalytic degradation of two dyes (AY -17 and 
RB-220) by UV and solar photocatalysis. As pH, catalyst loading and oxidant 
concentration are the important f actors affecting the AY -17 and RB -220 degradation 
by Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles, these variables were selected as the factors for 
optimization of photocatalytic process under UV and solar light irradiation. The 
optimum conditions were selected based on “one fac tor at a time” analysis. But these 
optimum conditions were obtained by crude optimization methodology and the 
interaction effects among the variables were not taken into account. In order to 
account for interaction effect among the variables, methodical op timization is RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 required. So in the current study, process optimization was carried out by using 
Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Central Composite experimental design was 
used to design the experiments needed for optimization of the values of these 
varia bles (factors) by RSM, for enhancing the percentage degradation of the dyes 
(response). Based on the preliminary studies the best oxidant for photocatalysis and 
the effective range of factors (pH, catalytic loading, and oxidant concentration) to be 
used in  the Central Composite Design was fixed for UV and solar photocatalysis of 
each of the two dyes.  
 Ammonium persulphate was chosen as the oxidant for the degradation of AY -
17 and RB -220 dye both for UV and solar photocatalysis, based on discussions 
present ed in Section 4.6.4. The main parameter affecting the photocatalytic 
degradation process is the initial pH of the reaction mixture. The effect of pH of 
reaction mixture on percentage degradation of AY -17 under UV and solar light was 
studied in the pH range of 1-9 as discussed in Section 4.6.1 and the results are 
presented in Figure 4.24 and Figure 4.25 respectively. Similarly the effect of pH on 
percentage degradation of RB -220 under UV light was studied in the pH range 2 -7 
and in case of solar light in the pH range 2 -9 as discussed in Section 4.6.1 and the 
results is presented in Figure 4.26 and Figure 4.27 respectively. The degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 were more in acidic pH range and almost no degradation was 
observed in the basic pH range in case of bo th irradiation sources. So for methodical 
optimization using RSM with CCD set of experiments, pH range was chosen only in 
acidic range of 1 to 5.  
 The percentage degradation of AY -17 by UV and solar photocatalysis at 
different catalyst loading were carried out with the dye solution of concentration 10 
mg/L as discussed in Section 4.6.2 and crude optimization resulted in 1:30 as the 
optimum dye to cat alyst loading ratio for UV and 1:10 for solar photocatalysis, with 
air as the oxidant. Similarly the percentage degradation of RB -220 by UV and solar 
photocatalysis at different catalyst loading were carried out with the dye solution 
concentration of 50 mg /L as discussed in Section 4.6.2 and crude optimization 
resulted in 1:20 as the optimum dye to catalyst loading ratio for UV and 1:10 for solar 
photocatalysis, with air as the oxidant. So for  methodical optimization using RSM 
with CCD experimental data se t, the range of catalyst loading chosen for AY -17 were RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
249 
 0.5 to 6.5 g/L for UV and 0.3 to 3.9 g/L for solar. These ranges cover the dye to 
catalyst ratio of 1:5 to 1:65 for UV photocatalysis and 1:3 to 1:39 for solar 
photocatalysis. Similarly the range of ca talyst loading for photocatalysis of RB -220 
dye were 1 to 2.6 g/L for UV and 0.2 to 2.2 g/L for solar photocatalysis.  These ranges 
cover the dye to catalyst ratio of 1:10 to 1:26 (g/g) for UV and 1:2 to 1:22 (g/g) for 
solar.  
 The effect of the next importa nt parameter, ammonium persulphate (oxidant) 
concentration, on the percentage degradation of AY -17 by UV and solar 
photocatalysis was investigated as discussed in Section 4.6.4 and the results are 
presented in Figure 4.38 and Figure 4.39 respectively. Maxi mum rate of degradation 
was observed with 2 g/L of ammonium persulphate concentration under UV and solar 
light irradiation. Similarly the effect of ammonium persulphate concentration, on the 
percentage degradation of RB -220 under UV and solar light were in vestigated as 
discussed in Section 4.6.4 and the results are presented in Figure 4.46 and Figure 4.47 
respectively. Maximum rate of degradation was observed with 1.5 g/L of ammonium 
persulphate concentration under UV and solar light irradiation. So the amm onium 
persulphate concentration range of 0.5 to 4.5 g/L for UV and solar photocatalysis of 
AY 17; 0.5 to 2.5 g/L for UV and solar photocatalysis of RB -220 were selected for 
CCD.  
 The various levels selected in this study for these factors are presented in  
Table 3.3 and Table 3.4 respectively for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and 
RB-220 dyes. For three variables with five levels, a set of 20 experiments is required 
as per CCD. 15 experiments are equidistant from a central experiment having the 
coded values (0, 0, 0) and are distributed on a sphere with a radius of 1. One Central 
experiment point with four replicates was also taken for high efficiency of the design. 
Therefore, a total of 20 experiments each, were conducted under both UV and solar 
light irradiation. The experimental conditions in uncoded form as per CCD for UV 
and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 are presented in Table 4.43 and those for RB -220 
are presented in Table 4.44. Catalyst loading, oxidant concentration and the initial pH 
were to b e optimized by RSM, using the results of experiments conducted as per 
Central Composite design matrix. Batch photocatalytic experiments were conducted 
under conditions specified by CCD and the percentage degradation of AY -17 were RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 obtained for each experime nt at the end of irradiation time of 15 min both for UV and 
solar photocatalysis and are presented as responses in Table 4.43. For solar 
photocatalysis of AY -17 dye, a verage UV and visible light intensity of solar light= 
3.61 mW/cm2 and 1226×100 lux respec tively from 12 a.m. to 12.15 p.m. Similarly the 
percentage degradation of RB -220 were obtained at the end of 20 min of irradiation 
for UV photocatalysis and 10 min of irradiation for solar photocatalysis for each 
experiment of CCD matrix conducted to optim ize the RB -220 degradation process 
and are presented as responses in Table 4.44. For solar photocatalysis of RB -220 dye, 
average UV and visible light intensity of solar light= 3.63 mW/cm2 and 1221×100 lux 
respectively from 12 a.m. to 12.10 p.m.  
 
4.8.1 Proc ess Analysis and optimization using response surface methodology 
(RSM)  
 
 The experimental input -output data (factors and response data) presented in 
Table 4.43 for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17; Table 4.44 for UV and solar 
photocatalysis of RB -220 w ere analyzed by response surface methodology using the 
software MINTAB 14. The input -output data for each case were fitted by a nonlinear 
regression equation (multiple regression analysis (MRA) models) of the form given in 
Eq.(3.7) and were used to describ e the relationship between the response and 
predictor variables (factors).  
Recalling Eq.(3.7),

 The regression coefficients were obtained. Table 4.45 shows the MRA models 
in uncoded form for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220. Statistical 
testing of the regression models was done in the form of analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) on the coded e quation, to test the significance and adequacy of the model. 
The results of ANOVA on the MRA models for AY -17 and RB -220 are presented in 
Table 4.46 for UV and solar photocatalysis.  The P values are used as a tool to check 
the significance of each of the coefficients, which, in turn, may indicate the pattern of 
interactions between the variables. The smaller the P value for a given term in the RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
251 
 model (generally less than 0.05), indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected and 
the term is significant i n the model. In this work, the ANOVA of the regression model 
demonstrates that the model is highly significant, as is evident from the calculated F 
value with a very low P values ( P <0.05) for linear, quadratic and combined effects of 
factors and for regre ssion. Hence, the regression models given in Eq.(3.7) with the 
corresponding regression coefficient values as shown in Table 4.45 for UV and solar 
photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes are the good prediction of the experimental 
results.  
 The goodness o f fit of the models was verified by the determination 
coefficient ( R2) and the values of the adjusted determination coefficient ( Adj R2). It is 
also the proportion of the variability in the response variables, which is accounted for 
by the regression analysis. Table 4.46 shows the  R2 and adj R2 values for the MRA 
models representing the degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes under UV and solar 
light irradiation. Table 4.43 to Table 4.44 also show the model predicted responses of 
AY-17 and RB -220 dye degr adation by UV and solar photocatalysis respectively. The 
observed values are the experimentally obtained values and the predicted values were 
calculated based on the respective model equation. Figure 4.60 and Figure 4.61 show 
the plot of model predicted vs . experimentally determined values of % degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 under UV and solar light irradiation with the R2 values. The R2 
values being greater than 0.99 for both the dyes (AY -17 and RB -220) in both cases of 
UV and solar photocatalysis, indica te the goodness of fit for the models to represent 
the experimental data and hence these models are accurate enough for the prediction 
of % degradation at the given set of predictor variables for UV and solar 
photocatalysis.  
 The MRA models were subjected to optimization using “Response optimizer” 
of MINITAB 14, so as to obtain the optimum values of the variables (factors) which 
maximize the dye degradation. The optimum values of the variables for degradation 
of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes by UV and solar photoca talysis are presented in Table 
4.47. Batch photocatalysis experiments under UV and solar light were conducted for 
AY-17 and RB -220 at their corresponding RSM based methodically optimized 
conditions and the percentage degradation at the specified irradiatio n time were 
obtained and are presented in Table 4.47. The MRA model predicted values at these RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
252 
 optimum conditions are also presented in the corresponding tables. It is observed that 
the experimental values obtained under optimum conditions match well with t he 
model predicted values and hence the MRA model is validated and RSM based 
optimization method is found to be very effective.  
 
4.8.2 Effect of predictor variables  
 
 To understand the effect of predictor variables (factors) as individuals (main 
effect) an d in interaction with the other predictor variables (interaction effect) on AY -
17 and RB -220 dye degradation, 3D response surface plots were generated from 
MRA models using MINITAB 14 . Evaluating interactions is extremely important, 
because an interaction  can magnify or cancel out main effects. At all the response 
surfaces, while the effects of two factors to each other were being inspected, the 
remaining one variable was held constant at zero (middle) level. The surface plots for 
% degradation of AY -17 by  UV and solar photocatalysis are presented in Figure 4.52 
and Figure 4.53 respectively. The surface plots for % degradation of RB -220 by UV 
and solar photocatalysis are presented in Figure 4.54 and Figure 4.55 respectively.

the response (% degradation of AY -17) for UV photocatalysis. The surface plot as 
observed from Figure 4.52 (i), shows the i nteraction of variables: pH and catalyst 
loading on % degradation of AY -17 by UV photocatalysis. As the pH was increased 
from 2 to around 3, percentage degradation increased marginally, but further increase 
in pH to values greater than 3, led to a sharp de crease in percentage degradation. 
Highly acidic pH favors the dye degradation. As the catalyst loading was increased 
upto a certain level, percentage degradation increased. But with further increase in 
catalyst loading, percentage degradation has decreased . The catalyst loading at which 
maximum percentage degradation occurred, has varied with the pH, which implies  
that pH and catalyst loading are the interacting factors in UV photocatalytic RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 degradation of AY -17 dye. Similar observations are made for solar photocatalysis of 
AY-17 dye as shown in Figure 4.53 (i), which implied the interaction effect of pH and 
catalyst loading in solar photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 dye. Figure 4.52 (ii), 
shows the interaction of variables: pH and ammonium persulphate con centration in 
UV photocatalysis of AY -17. The plot shows an increase in percentage dye 
degradation as the ammonium persulfate concentration increases to a certain level, 
beyond which the percentage degradation decreases. The concentration of ammonium 
persu lphate at which maximum degradation occurs is found to decrease with the 
increase in pH.  It indicates the interaction effect between pH and ammonium 
persulphate concentration on UV photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 dye. Similar 
observations are made in the case of solar photocatalysis of AY -17 dye, as presented 
in Figure 4.53 (ii), with the indication of interaction effect of pH and ammonium 
persulphate concentration. Figure 4.52 (iii) shows the interaction of variables: catalyst 
loading and ammonium per sulphate concentration in UV photocatalysis of AY -17 
dye. The plot shows an increase in the percentage dye degradation as the catalyst 
loading increases to a certain level, beyond which the percentage degradation 
decreases. Ammonium persulphate concentrati on at which maximum percentage 
degradation occurred has varied with the catalyst loading. Interaction between catalyst 
loading and ammonium persulphate concentration is significant. Similar is the case of 
AY-17 dye degradation under solar light, as shown i n Figure 4.53 (iii), where in 
ammonium persulphate concentration at which maximum percentage degradation of 
AY-17 dye occurred has varied with the catalyst loading.  Significant interaction 
between pH and catalyst loading; pH and oxidant concentration; cat alyst loading and 
oxidant concentration were observed for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17dye.  
 A contour plot is a graphical representation of the relationships among three 
numeric variables in two dimensions. Two variables are for X and Y axes, and a  third 
variable Z is for contour levels.  The response surfaces having circular contour plots 
indicate that the interaction between the corresponding variables is negligible. An 
elliptical or saddle nature of the contour plots indicates the significance of the 
interactions between the corresponding variables. In the case of saddle contour plots, 
the optimum values are obtained at the point of intersection of lines which are formed 
by joining the locus (Murthy et al.  2000).  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 The contour plots for % degradation  of AY -17 by UV and solar photocatalysis 
are presented in Figure 4.56 and Figure 4.57 respectively. From the contour plots 
shown in Figure 4.56, for % degradation of AY -17 under UV light it can be seen that 
the plots being elliptical indicate the significa nce of the interactions between the 
variables, catalyst loading and ammonium persulfate; pH and ammonium persulfate; 
pH and catalyst loading. It can be observed, each factor influenced the other. Similar 
observations were made in case of photocatalysis of AY-17 dye under solar light, as 
shown in Figure 4.57. It can be seen that each factor has an interactive influence with 
the other on percentage degradation.  
 
4.8.2.2 Effect of predictor variables on UV and solar photocatalysis of RB -220 
dye 
 
 Figure 4.54 and Figure 4.55 illustrate the surface plots for interaction between 
the variables with % degradation of RB -220 (response) for UV and solar 
photocatalysis respectively. Figure 4.54 shows the surface plots for interaction 
between variables with % degradation of RB -220 for UV photocatalysis. The surface 
plot as observed from Figure 4.54 (i), shows the interaction of variables: pH and 
catalyst loading. As the pH is increased from 2 to around 3.2, percentage degradation 
has increased marginally, but  further increase in pH above 3.2, has led to sharp 
decrease in percentage degradation. Highly acidic pH favors the dye degradation. As 
the catalyst loading increased upto a certain level, percentage degradation has 
increased. But with further increase in catalyst loading, the percentage degradation 
has decreased. The catalyst loading at which maximum percentage degradation has 
occurred, varied with the pH, which implies  that pH and catalyst loading are the 
interacting factors in UV photocatalytic degradat ion. Similar observations are made 
with solar photocatalysis as shown in Figure 4.55 (i), which implied the interaction 
effect of pH and catalyst loading in solar photocatalytic degradation of RB -220. 
Figure 4.54 (ii), shows the interaction of variables: p H and ammonium persulphate 
concentration. The plot shows an increase in percentage dye degradation as the 
ammonium persulfate concentration increases to a certain level, beyond which the 
percentage degradation decreases. At higher pH of around 4.2, maximum  percentage RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 degradation of the dye occurred at low ammonium persulphate concentration. The 
concentration of ammonium persulphate at which maximum degradation occurs is 
found to decrease with the increase in pH.  It indicates the interaction effect between 
pH and ammonium persulphate concentration on UV photocatalytic degradation of 
RB-220 dye. Similar observations are made in the case of solar photocatalysis, as 
presented in Figure 4.55 (ii), with the indication of interaction effect of pH and 
ammonium pers ulphate concentration on solar photocatalytic degradation of RB -220. 
Figure 4.54 (iii) shows the interaction of variables: catalyst loading and ammonium 
persulphate concentration on UV photocatalysis of RB -220. The plot shows increase 
in percentage dye deg radation as the catalyst loading increases to a certain level, 
beyond which the percentage degradation decreases. Ammonium persulphate 
concentration at which maximum percentage degradation occurred has changed with 
the catalyst loading, indicating the  int eraction between catalyst loading and 
ammonium persulphate concentration to be  considerable. Similar is the case with 
solar photocatalysis, as shown in Figure 4.55 (iii), wherein ammonium persulphate 
concentration at which maximum percentage degradation o ccurred has varied with the 
catalyst loading.  
 The contour plots for % degradation of RB -220 for UV and solar 
photocatalysis are presented in Figure 4.58 and Figure 4.59 respectively. From the 
contour plots for % degradation of RB -220 under UV light and so lar light, it can be 
seen that the plots being elliptical indicate the significance of the interactions between 
the variables, catalyst loading and ammonium persulfate; pH and ammonium 
persulfate; pH and catalyst loading. Each factor interacted with the ot her in 
influencing the percentage degradation of RB -220.

 4.8.3 Validation of RSM based methodical optimization and its comparison with 
crude optimization of the factors for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and 
RB-220  
 
Batch photocatalysis experiments were conducted under methodically optimized 
conditions of  pH, catalyst loading and ammonium persulfate concentration as 
obtained from RSM using the results of experiments conducted as per Central 
Composite design. The RSM based methodically optimized conditions and the crude 
optimized conditions (based on one fa ctor at a time analysis) explained in Section 4.6, 
at which the batch experiments were performed for the photocatalytic degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 under UV and solar light are presented in Table 4.47. The initial 
dye concentration used was 100 mg/L. T he methodically optimized conditions 
showed highly efficient UV and solar photocatalytic process for both the dyes (AY -17 
and RB -220). In other words, time for dye degradation reduced, showing complete 
reduction of the dye at a shorter time period as compa red to that under crude 
optimization conditions. It shows that under methodically optimized conditions, rate 
of reduction has enhanced tremendously. It can be observed that percentage 
degradation of AY -17 dye was 98.78 % and more than 99 % in 15 min of irr adiation 
with UV and solar light  respectively under methodically optimized conditions, 
whereas under crude optimization conditions the degradations were only around 76 % 
and 82 % respectively at similar irradiation time periods.   
 Percentage degradation of RB -220 dye was 98.62 % in 20 min and more than 
99 % in 10 min with UV and solar photocatalysis respectively under methodically 
optimized conditions, whereas only around 82 % and 86 % degradation were obtained 
at similar irradiation time periods under cr ude optimization conditions. The time 
course variations of AY -17 and RB -220 dye concentrations obtained with 
methodically optimized conditions as compared to the crude optimization conditions 
are presented in Table 4.48 to Table 4.49 respectively for UV an d solar 
photocatalysis. Figure 4.62 and Figure 4.63 show the reduction in time for complete 
degradation of the dyes with methodically optimized conditions as compared to the 
crude optimization conditions, which indicate that the rate of dye degradation by 
Ag@TiO 2 can be greatly increased by using the RSM based methodically optimized RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
267 
 conditions. These results indicate the effectiveness of RSM based optimization. The 
knowledge on optimum conditions is advantageous especially in large -scale dye 
degradation pro cesses where factors such as cost and time are of extreme importance. 
The increase in rate will eventually result in lowering the size of reactor to be used for 
continuous dye degradation from industrial effluents, thereby reducing the capital 
cost. Operat ing cost can as well be reduced due to minimum requirement of the 
catalyst and the oxidant. The time of operation can be reduced in the case of batch 
reactors.

 4.9 Effect of initial concentration of the dyes on UV and solar photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 and  RB-220 under optimized conditions  
 
4.9.1 Effect of initial concentration of AY -17 on the UV and solar photocatalytic 
degradation under optimized conditions  
 
The effect of initial concentration of AY -17 on its photocatalytic degradation was 
studied, as it is important from both mechanistic and application point of view. 
Generally industrial wastewater treatment plants are designed to handle effluents of 
specified quality corresponding to normal conditions. Catalyst loading for the 
photocatalytic treatment p rocess is selected based on optimum dye to catalyst ratio, so 
as to be adequate for the concentration of dyes in the industrial effluent under normal 
conditions. The reactor for the said operation will be designed based on the rate of 
photocatalysis with t his optimum catalyst loading for the given dye concentration 
corresponding to normal conditions of effluent. But sometimes the concentration of 
dye in the effluent may vary owing to variation in process operation. If the 
concentration increases, then the c atalyst loading used may be inadequate for 
photocatalysis and hence longer time of irradiation may be needed in batch 
photocatalytic reactor or the volume of continuous reactor may be inadequate to 
obtain the effluent that meets the environmental standards . Studies on effect of initial 
concentration of the dye on photocatalytic degradation is very important to understand 
the unsteady state behavior of the process under abnormal conditions, which will in 
turn help in understanding the dynamics and control of  the process. In the present 
work, the effect of initial concentration of AY -17 on the photocatalytic degradation 
was investigated over the concentration range from 100 mg/L to 700 mg/L at 
optimized conditions of pH=2.9; Catalyst loading= 3.4 g/L; (NH 4)2S2O8= 2.25 g/L for 
UV photocatalysis and pH=2.1; Catalyst loading= 1.8 g/L; (NH 4)2S2O8= 2.71 g/L for 
solar photocatalysis as mentioned in Table 4.47,  under UV and solar light irradiation. 
The experiments were conducted by keeping the catalyst loading at the  optimum 
obtained for 100 mg/L dye concentration. So when the initial dye concentration was 
varied, the dye to catalyst ratio also varied. Hence in these cases dye to catalyst 
loading ratio is not the optimum. Time course variations of AY -17 dye concentrat ions RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
270 
 obtained with different initial dye concentration are shown in Table 4.50 and Table 
4.51 respectively for UV and solar photocatalysis.  
 Figure 4.64a depicts the effect of initial dye concentration on time course 
variation of photocatalytic degradation  of AY -17 dye under UV light irradiation. As 
revealed in Figure 4.65a as the dye concentration increases from 100 to 400 mg/L, the 
percentage degradation at the end of 360 min irradiation time decreases marginally 
from 99.97 to 95.49 %. But further increas e in concentration above 400 mg/L upto 
700 mg/L, resulted in decrease in percentage degradation to around 61 %. It was 
observed, for dye solutions of 100 mg/L almost 100 % degradation occurred within 60 
min, in case of 200 mg/L almost 96 % degradation occu rred within 60 min and in case 
of 300 mg/L, almost 95 % degradation was observed in 60 min. For 400 mg/L of the 
dye solution degradation was 86.22 % in 60 min and it gets further decreased on 
increasing the concentration of dye. High rates of degradation w ere observed within 
60 min of irradiation time with concentration less than 400 mg/L.  
 Figure 4.64b shows the effect of initial dye concentration on time course 
variation of photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 dye under solar light irradiation. The 
experi ments were conducted by keeping the catalyst loading at the optimum obtained 
for 100 mg/L dye concentration. So when the initial dye concentration was varied, the 
dye to catalyst ratio varied. As observed in Figure 4.65b, as the concentration 
increases fro m 100 mg/L to 400 mg/L, the percentage degradation (at the end of 360 
min irradiation time) decreases marginally from 100 to 97.83 %. But further increase 
in concentration above 400 mg/L upto 700 mg/L, resulted in decrease in percentage 
degradation to arou nd 67 %. For dye solutions of 100 mg/L almost complete 
degradation occurred within 30 min, almost 97 % in case of 200 mg/L and 95 % 
degradation in case of 300 mg/L were observed in 60 min. For 400 mg/L of the dye 
solution degradation was 89 % in 60 min and  it gets further decreased on increasing 
the concentration of dye. As in UV photocatalysis As in UV photocatalysis, high rates 
of degradation were observed within 60 min of irradiation time with concentration of  
less than 400 mg/L.  
 The possible explanat ion for this behavior is that, when the initial dye 
concentration in the reaction mixture is low, the ratio of dye to catalyst loading is 
lower. As the dye concentration is increased, the ratio increases. If the dye to catalyst RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
271 
 ratio increases, then the nu mber of dye molecules present per unit surface area of 
catalyst increases. The increase in dye concentration also decreases the path length of 
photon entering the dye solution  and the opposite effect is observed in low 
concentration, thus at lower concentr ation the number of photon absorption by the 
catalyst increases (Davis et al. 1994).  At high dye concentration a significant amount 
of light may be absorbed by the dye molecules rather than the catalyst and this may 
also reduce the catalytic efficiency (Mi lls et al. 1993). Also the degradation rate is 
directly proportional to the probability of formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH.) on the 
catalyst surface and the probability of hydroxyl radicals reacting with the dye 
molecules (Tang and An 1995). As the init ial concentration of the dye increases, the 
interaction of .OH radical with dye decreases. Further, increase in concentration also 
reduces the light penetration and the relative formation of hydroxyl radicals; 
superoxide radical anions decreases leading to  the decreased photodegradation 
efficiency. The results also indicate the effectiveness of the catalyst to degrade the dye 
solution at concentration upto 300 mg/L, to an extent of above 96 % in UV 
photocatalysis and 97 % in solar photocatalysis within 120 min of irradiation time and 
400 mg/L dye solution to above 95 % in 360 min of UV light irradiation and 180 min 
of solar light irradiation. Greater than 98 % degradation of upto 300 mg/L AY -17 dye 
was possible within 360 min of UV and solar light irradiatio n. So if there is a 
possibility of large deviations from normal conditions of dye concentration in the 
industrial effluent, then proper control measures are to be taken in the treatment 
process to keep the treated effluent quality within the standard. It i s always advisable 
to design the reactor based on most probable maximum dye concentration in the 
industrial effluent and its corresponding optimum catalyst loading, so that the treated 
effluent quality will always meet the standard.

 The effect of initial concentration of RB -220 on the photocatalytic degradation 
was investigated over the concentration range from 100 mg/L to 500 mg/L at 
optimized conditions [pH=3 .2, Catalyst loading= 1.8 g/L, (NH 4)2S2O8= 1.3 g/L] under 
UV light irradiation. In case of solar light irradiation effect of initial concentration of 
RB-220 was investigated over the concentration range from 100 mg/L to 700 mg/L at 
optimized conditions [pH =3.3, Catalyst loading= 1.11 g/L, = (NH 4)2S2O8= 1.36 g/L]. 
The experiments were conducted by keeping the catalyst loading at the optimum 
obtained for 100 mg/L dye concentration. Hence dye to catalyst loading ratio is not 
the optimum. Time course variations  of RB -220 dye concentrations obtained with 
different initial dye concentration are shown in Table 4.52 -4.53 respectively for UV 
and solar photocatalysis.  
 Figure 4.66a which presents the effect of initial dye concentration on time 
course variation of phot ocatalytic degradation of RB -220 dye under UV light 
irradiation, reveals that as the initial dye concentration increases, rate of degradation 
reduces. As seen in Figure 4.67a, as the concentration increases from 100 mg/L to 500 
mg/L, the percentage degrada tion at the end of 240 min of irradiation time decreases 
from 100 % to 92.25 %. For dye solutions of 100 mg/L, almost 100 % degradation 
occurred, almost 96 % degradation in case of 200 mg/L and almost 93 % degradation 
in case of 300 mg/L were achieved in 6 0 min of irradiation time. For 400 mg/L of the 
dye solution degradation was 90 % in 60 min and the percentage degradation further 
decreased on increasing the concentration of the dye. High rates of degradation were 
observed within 60 min of irradiation tim e.  
 Figure 4.66b shows the effect of initial dye concentration on time course 
variation of photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 dye under solar light irradiation. As 
the initial dye concentration increased, rate of degradation reduced. Figure 4.67b 
shows that as the concentration increases from 100 mg/L to 700 mg/L, the percentage 
degradation at the end of 120 min irradiation time decreases from 100 to 93.87 %. It 
was observed from Figure 4.66b, for dye solutions of 100 mg/L almost complete 
degradation occ urred within 10 min, almost 87 % degradation in case of 200 mg/L, RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
275 
 and almost 68 % degradation in case of 300 mg/L could be achieved in 10 min. For 
400 mg/L of the dye solution degradation was 57 % in 10 min and it was further 
decreased on increasing the co ncentration of the dye. High rates of degradation were 
observed within 10 to 15 min of irradiation time with concentrations of 100 mg/L and 
200 mg/L.  
 The possible explanation for this behavior has already been discussed in 
Section 4.10.1.  The results also  indicate the effectiveness of the catalyst to degrade 
the dye solution at concentration upto 500 mg/L, to an extent of above 92 % within 
240 min of UV light irradiation time and 700 mg/L dye solution to above 94 % in 120 
min of solar light irradiation tim e. Greater than 99 % degradation of (i) upto 500 mg/L 
RB-220 could be achieved within 45 min of irradiation by solar photocatalysis and (ii) 
upto 300 mg/L could be achieved within 240 min of irradiation by UV photocatalysis.  
So, as discussed in Section 4. 10.1, it is always advisable to design the reactor based 
on most probable maximum dye concentration in the industrial effluent and its 
corresponding optimum catalyst loading, so that the treated effluent quality will 
always meet the standard.

4.10 Kinetics of degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 under UV and solar light 
irradiation  
 
Determinatio n of rate equation governing photocatalytic process and the evaluation of 
the parameters of the rate equation are important for the design of photoreactors 
which are used for photocatalysis of dyes in wastewater.  Rate kinetics is important to 
determine th e volume of continuous reactors for photocatalysis or to determine the 
time to be provided for photocatalytic reaction in batch reactor. Studies on kinetics of 
degradation help in the prediction of rate equation. To analyze the heterogeneous 
photocatalytic  reaction kinetics successfully, many researchers (Chen and Ray 1998; 
Wenhua et al. 2000; Galindo et al. 2001) have used the modified Langmuir –
Hinshelwood (L –H) kinetic expression.   
 The data obtained by conducting UV and solar photocatalysis experiments  at 
optimum reaction conditions of pH, catalyst loading and  (NH 4)2S2O8 concentration, 
by varying the initial dye concentration has been rationalized in terms of the modified 90 92 94 96 98 100

 form of L –H kinetic model to describe the solid –liquid reaction successfully. The  L-H 
model assumes that the reaction on the surface governs the rate, with one of the 
elementary steps in the reaction sequence constituting a rate determining step, thus all 
the adsorption/desorption steps are quasi -equilibrated. It is assumed that dyes a re 
strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface, than the intermediate products and the rate 
of degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dye by surface reaction is proportional to the 
surface coverage of dye on Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles (Al -Ekabi and Serpone 1988). 
The ef fect of dye concentration on the rate of degradation is given in the form of 
Eq.(4.6) (Matthews 1987)  
(                
                            (4.6)  
where ( –r) is the reaction rate of AY -17 or RB -220 dye being degraded, Cdye is the 
concentration of the dye , kobs is the constant related to adsorption and kR is the 
reaction rate constant. To estimate the parameters, it has been customary to write 
Eq.(4.6) in linear form using the reciprocals as shown in Eq.(4.7) and then to plot the 
reciprocal of initial reac tion rate, 1/( r), versus the reciprocal of initial concentration, 
1/Cdye  
  
   
                 
                               (4.7)  
This method is called the method of initial rates (Levenspiel 1972). To 
estimate the parameters in Eq.(4.7), rates of AY -17 and RB -220 dye degradation were 
obtained by drawing tangents at time t=0, on plots of dye concentration vs. time data 
obtained by ba tch experiments with different initial dye concentrations under UV and 
solar light. The initial dye concentrations and their corresponding rates by UV and 
solar photocatalysis, calculated manually for AY -17 and RB -220 are given in Table 
4.54 and Table 4.55  respectively.  1/(r) versus 1/ Cdye was plotted for AY -17 and RB -
220 as shown in Figure 4.68 and Figure 4.69. The linearity of the plots show the 
applicability of L -H kinetics and the values of kinetic parameters were estimated from 
the slope and intercept.  The values of k obs and k R are presented in Table 4.56 for 
degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dye by UV and solar photocatalysis. The 
applicability of L –H equation for the degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 has been 
confirmed by the linear nature of the plot. Th is indicates that the rate of degradation 
of the dye is determined mainly by the reaction occurring on the surface of Ag@TiO 2.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

4.11 Effect of light intensity on the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -

Light intensity is a very important parameter in photocatalysis, as the light is to be 
absorbed by catalyst to initiate the reaction. The rate of initiation step in 
photocatalysis that is generation of electron and holes is dependent on the light 
intensity . The pollutant conversion and degradation efficiency depends on the y = 8.7888x + 5.6759

 distribution of light intensity in the reactor (Ollis et al. 1991). So effect of UV and 
solar light intensity was studied on the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -
220 dyes. All t he experiments were conducted with crude optimized conditions as 
obtained from Section 4.6.  
 
a) Under UV light  
 
 Batch photocatalysis experiments were carried out in an immersion well 
reactor to study the effect of light intensity on photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 
dyes using Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured nanoparticles as a photocatalyst under UV 
light irradiation with medium pressure mercury vapor lamps of 80 W and 125 W 
power. These experiments were conducted with crude optimized condition and air at 
flow rate of 2 LPM was used as the oxidant. In these experiments ammonium 
persulfate was not used as an oxidant, but air was supplied as a source of oxidant. 
Addition of ammonium persulfate was found not necessary, as air itself was found 
sufficient due to hi gh power of UV lamps. The rate of photocatalysis with air itself 
was very rapid. The effect of UV radiation power  on the photocatalytic degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 dyes was studied at initial dye concentration of 100 mg/L, pH=3 
and with catalyst loadin g of 3 g/L for AY -17 and 2 g/L for RB -220. The results with 
lamps of 80 W and 125 W powers are presented in  Figure 4.70. T he average UV light 
intensities measured at the surface of immersion well reactor with 80 and 125 W are 
11.2 and 13.5  mW/cm2 respectiv ely. Time course variations of AY -17 and RB -220 
dye concentrations obtained with different average UV light intensities are shown in 
Table 4.57 for UV photocatalysis. Figure 4.70 clearly shows that the rate of removal 
increases with increasing UV light int ensity for both the dyes. As UV power increases 
from 80 to 125 W, UV light radiation intensity also increases from 11.2 to 13.5 
mW/cm2 which increases the degradation of AY -17 from 74.83 to 92.3 % and RB -
220 from 79.22 to 94.55 % (in  5 min irradiation). A lmost complete degradation of 
both the dyes was achieved in 10 min with 125 W lamp, whereas with 80W lamp it 
took around 20 min for the same degradation. When the experiments were conducted 
in batch stirred reactor illuminated from outside by two UV lamps of 36 W each (UV 
light intensity= 5.85 mW/cm2), under same set of conditions used in the immersion RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 well reactor, around 66 % degradation of AY -17 and 91 % degradation of RB -220 
was achieved in 360 and 240 min of UV irradiation respectively as presented in 
Section 4.6.3. It clearly indicates that higher light intensity enhances the rate of 
photocatalysis.  
 UV light intensity determines the amount of photon absorbed by the catalyst. 
More photons are absorb by the catalyst surface with increase of UV light in tensity as 
a result more formation of electron –hole pairs occurs on the catalyst surface which 
further increase concentration of hydroxyl radicals and consequently increases the rate 
of photocatalysis. Previous studies (Oliveira et al. 1990; Inel and Okte 1996; 
Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006b ) on the effect of light intensity have shown 
the following relationship between intensity and degradation rate: (i) at low light 
intensities, with increase in radiation intensity the rate of degradation increases 
linearly, (ii) at intermediate light intensities, the rate of degradation depends on the 
square root of the radiation intensity and (iii) at high light intensities, the rate is 
independent of radiation intensity. The transition points between these regimes will 
vary with pollutant and photocatalyst species. According to Daneshvar et al. (2004) 
the linear relation indicates that saturation of the catalyst by the incident photons was 
not reached and electron –hole pairs are consumed more rapidly by chemical rea ctions 
than by recombination, therefore the rate of formation of the electron –hole pairs is 
directly proportional to the light intensity. Since light intensity used in present study is 
below 20 mW/cm2 and it is reported in literature that, below this inten sity, rate 
follows linear relationship hence it was assumed that the rate and intensity to have 
linear relation. The initial rates obtained were 0.04 mM.min-1 and 0.05 mM.min-1 for 
AY-17 and 0.03 mM.min-1 and 0.04 mM.min-1 for RB -220 with light intensities  of 
11.2 and 13.5 mW/cm2. The relationship between the rate of degradation of the dyes 
with UV light intensity are given by Eq.(4.8).  
                           (4.8)  
where I is the light intensity and K I is the constant of proportionality. K I values were 
found to be 33×10-4 (mM.cm2).(mW.min)-1 for AY -17 degradation and 28×10-4  
(mM.cm2).(mW.min)-1 for RB -220 degradation. Muruganandham and Swaminathan 
(2006b) and Ollis et al. (1991) have reported linear increase in rate with increase in  
radiati on intensity, at lower light intensity of < 20 mW/cm2.  The intensities used in RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
283 
 the present study are less than 20 mW/cm2 and hence  the linear increase in rate with 
increase in UV light intensity is justified.

 Batch photocatalysis experiments were carried out in a batch stirred reactor to 
study the effect of light intensity on solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes 
using Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured nanoparticles as a photocatalyst on a sunny day, 
semi cloudy day and a cloud y day. These experiments were conducted with crude 
optimized condition and no additional oxidant was used in this study. Dissolved and 
atmospheric oxygen itself acted as an oxidant. The effect of solar light intensity on 
photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes were studied at initial 
concentration of 100 mg/L, pH=3 and with catalyst loading of 1 g/L. Three 
experiments were performed at different conditions of illumination; one on a full 
sunny day (clear sky), another on a semi cloudy day, and th e other on full cloudy day 
as shown in Figure 4.71. The average UV and Visible light intensities on a full sunny, 
semi and full cloudy day are presented in Table 4.58. Visible light intensity was 
measured in terms of lux which is a measure of illuminance. The lux is one lumen per 
square meter (lm/m2), and the corresponding radiometric unit, which 
measures  intensity , is the watt per square meter (W/m2). There is no single conversion 
factor between lux and W/m2; there is a different conversion factor for ever y 
wavelength, and it is not possible to make a conversion unless one knows the spectral 
composition of the light. The peak of the luminosity function is at 555  nm (green). 
For monochromatic light  of this wavelength, the irradiance needed to make one lux is  
the minimum, at 1.464×10-4 mW/cm2. So the visible light intensity of solar light was 
calculated in terms of mW/cm2 by assuming wavelength at 555 nm (as reference). The 
values are presented in Table 4.58. Time course variations of AY -17 and RB -220 dye 
conc entrations obtained with different average solar light intensity are shown in Table 
4.59 for UV and solar photocatalysis. It could be noticed from Figure 4.71a, around 
60 % degradation of AY -17 occurred on a full sunny day and around 39 % and 15 % 
degradat ion of AY -17 was observed on semi and full cloudy day after 60 min of 
irradiation time. As seen from Figure 4.71a, degradation increased with increase in 
irradiation time and around 97 %, 84 %, and 62 % degradation of AY -17 took place in 
360 min on a full sunny, semi and full cloudy day respectively. Since the UV and RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
285 
 visible light intensities on full cloudy day are much less as compared to full sunny 
day, the degradation of AY -17 dye was not completed on a full cloudy day.  
 Figure 4.71b shows that, during photocatalysis of RB -220 around 69 % 
degradation occurred on a full sunny and around 39 % and 16 % degradation was 
observed on semi and full cloudy day after 60 min of irradiation time. As observed 
from Figure 4.71b, degradation increased with increase in irradiation time and around 
100 %, 90 %, and 67 % degradation of RB -220 took place with a full sunny, semi and 
full cloudy day respectively. Due to lower UV and visible light intensities on full 
cloudy day as compared to full sunny day, the degradation of RB-220 dye was not 
completed on a full cloudy day.  
 This suggests that when the light intensity is much less, hydroxyl and oxygen 
radicals could not be generated properly and constantly on a full cloudy day (Ali et al. 
1996). Such an effect was expected a s light intensity determines the amount of photon 
absorbed by the catalyst. Under the higher intensity of light illumination, the 
degradation was considerably higher because the electron -hole formation and storage 
of electron in Ag core is predominant and,  hence, electron -hole recombination is 
negligible. However, at lower light intensity such as on full cloudy day, rate of 
electron -hole pair generation and storage in the Ag core may be much lesser than the 
rate of recombination which in turn decreases the formation of free radicals, causing 
reduction in the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dye.  
 The initial rates of degradation of dyes were calculated using the tangents 
drawn at t=0, on concentration - time data obtained with photocatalysis of  AY-17 and 
RB-220 on full sunny day, semi cloudy day and cloudy day. Rate versus average UV 
and Visible light intensity  of sunlight on these days were plotted for AY -17 and RB -
220 dyes as shown in Figure 4.72 and Figure 4.73 respectively and the values of KI 
were estimated from the slope. The rate of degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 were 
found to increase linearly with UV and visible light intensity and the corresponding 
KI values are presented in Table 4.58 for AY -17 and RB -220 degradation under solar 
light irradiation. Linear nature of Figure 4.72 and Figure 4.73 confirms that rate 
increases linearly with UV and Visible light intensity. Similar result was reported in 
earlier studies ( Muruganandham and Swaminathan 2006b; Ollis et al. 1991) and as 
explained in Section 4.11.1 it was reported that at lower light intensity of 0-20 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
286 
 mW/cm2, the rate increases linearly with increasing radiation intensity.  The rate of 
degradation of AY -17 under  a sunny day was about two and three times higher than 
that of photocatalytic degradation under a semi cloudy and full cloudy day, 
respectively. The rate of degradation of RB -220 under a full sunny day was about two 
and three times higher than that of phot ocatalytic degradation under a semi cloudy 
and full cloudy day, respectively.

 is added which plays a significant role in fastness of colour and dye fixation on the 
fabrics dye on the fabrics. NaCl is also added during dying process for the transfer of 
dyes to fabric. The dye industry wastewater c ontains a considerable amount of 
carbonate and chloride ions. Presence of these chemicals in wastewater may alter the 
rate of photocatalysis. So, the effect of presence of NaCl and Na 2CO 3 on the 
photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 under UV and s olar light at RSM 
based methodically optimized conditions were studied in a batch stirred reactor. RSM 
based methodically optimized conditions for the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 
and RB -220 at initial concentration of 100 mg/L under UV and solar li ght irradiation 
are presented in Table 4.47.  
 
(a) UV light irradiation  
 
 The time course variations of dye concentrations during the UV photocatalysis 
of AY -17 and RB -220 dye with different concentrations of NaCl  are presented in 
Table 4.60 -4.61 respectively. The influence of Cl- ion on the photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 was studied by conducting experiments in the 
presence and absence of NaCl and the results are presented in Figure 4.74a and 4.74b 
respectively.  As seen from Figure 4.74, in the  absence of NaCl rate of degradation is 
more as compared to that in the presence of NaCl. Addition of NaCl has tremendously 
reduced the rate of degradation of the dyes. Increased addition of NaCl from 25 mg/L 
to 100 mg/L to the reaction mixture decreases t he degradation (after 60 min) of AY -
17 from 96.44 to 77.40 % and RB -220 from 98.38 to 85.63 %. The degradation (after 
120 min of irradiation) decreased from 99.02 to 92.56 % for AY -17 as the NaCl 
concentration was increased from 25 mg/L to 100 mg/L. Simila rly addition of NaCl 
from 25 mg/L to 100 mg/L has decreased the degradation (at 120 min irradiation 
time) of RB -220 from 99.23 to 96.41 %. Rate of degradation has decreased with the 
increased addition of NaCl. The hole and hydroxyl radical scavenging prope rty of Cl- 
results in the decrease in photocatalytic degradation efficiency (Wenhua et al. 2000). 
The chloride radical anions formed can also block the reactive sites of the catalyst 
surface.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

  The effect of presence of CO 32- ion on the photocatalytic degr adation of AY -
17 and RB -220 was studied by conducting experiments with and without the presence 
of Na 2CO 3 and the results are shown in Figure 4.75. The time course variations of 
AY-17 and RB -220 dye concentrations during the UV photocatalysis of AY -17 and 
RB-220 dyes with different concentrations of Na 2CO 3 are presented in Table 4.62. 
Addition of 25 to 50 mg/L of Na 2CO 3 decreases the degradation (after 60 min) of AY -
17 from 92.74 to 82.91 % and RB -220 from 92.25 to 83.38 %. As seen from Figure 
4.75, in the absence of Na 2CO 3, rate of degradation is more as compared to that in the 
presence of Na 2CO 3 and the rate decreases with the increase in Na 2CO 3 concentration. 
The hydroxyl radical scavenging property of carbonate ion results in decrease in the 
degradation efficiency of the dye. Thus, the primary oxidant hydroxyl radical 
decreases gradually with the increase in carbonate ion and consequently there  is a 
significant decrease in photocatalytic oxidation.  
 
(b) Solar light irradiation  
 
 The time course variations of dye concentrations during the solar 
photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dye with different concentrations of NaCl  are 
presented in Table 4.63 a nd Table 4.64 respectively. The influence of Cl- ion on the 
solar photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 was studied and the results are 
shown in Figure 4.76. Increased addition of NaCl from 25 mg/L to 100 mg/L to the 
reaction mixture decreases the  degradation (after 60 min) of AY -17 from 97.81 to 
87.91 % and RB -220 from 98.73 to 91.41 %. The degradation of AY -17 decreased 
from 99.26 to 96.56 % as the NaCl concentration was increased from 25 mg/L to 100 
mg/L. Similarly addition of NaCl from 25 mg/L to 100 mg/L has decreased the 
degradation (at 120 min irradiation time) from 99.86 to 98.66 % for RB -220. As seen 
from Figure 4.76, in the absence of NaCl rate of degradation is more as compared to 
that in the presence of NaCl. Rate of degradation has decr eased with the increased 
addition of NaCl. The reason for decrease in the degradation of the dye in the 
presence of NaCl is as explained in Section 4.12a.  
 The effect of presence of CO 32- ion on the photocatalytic degradation of AY -
17 and RB -220 were also studied and the time course variations of AY -17 and RB -RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
291 
 220 dye concentrations during the solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dye 
with different concentrations of Na 2CO 3 are presented in Table 4.65. Addition of 25 to 
50 mg/L of Na 2CO 3 decreases the deg radation (after 60 min) of AY -17 from 97.56 to 
90.72 % and RB -220 from 97.61 to 92.32 %. As seen from Figure 4.77, in the absence 
of Na 2CO 3 rate of degradation is more as compared to that in the presence of Na 2CO 3 
and the rate decreases with the increase i n Na 2CO 3 concentration. The reason for 
decrease in the degradation of the dye by the presence of Na 2CO 3 is as explained in 
Section 4.12a.  
 So it may be concluded that the presence of salts viz. NaCl and Na 2CO 3 affect 
the photocatalytic activity of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles during UV and solar 
photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220. So it is important to take salt concentration in 
the effluent into consideration while designing the photoreactor for treatment of 
dyeing wastewater.

4.13 Degree of mineralization of dyes during UV and solar photocatalysis  
 
In order to assess the degree of dye mineralization achieved during the photocatalytic 
treatment, the formation of CO 2 and the inorganic ions (Bianco -Prevot et al. 2001; 
Zhang et al. 1998; Liu et al. 1999; Stylid i et al. 2003; Tanaka et al. 2000; Spadaro et 
al. 1994) is generally determined. However, in real wastewaters the monitoring of 
inorganic ions and CO 2 gives only a global estimation on the well -functioning of the 
treatment, but does not provide information  on the real decay of the contaminant. In 
such cases the determination of total organic carbon (TOC) and/or the measurement 
of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) or the biological oxygen demand (BOD) of 
the photocatalytically treated water is generally used for monitoring the 
mineralization of the dyes (Neppolian et al. 2002a; Zhang et al. 1998; Sakthivel et al. 
2003; So et al. 2002; Tanaka et al. 2000; Hu et al. 2003; Chun and Yizhong 1999). So 0 20 40 60 80 100

 (b) solar light  (a) UV light  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
297 
 photocatalytic mineralization of dyes (AY -17 and RB -200) under U V and solar light 
irradiation was studied by measuring TOC and COD of the dye solution. Batch 
experiments were performed under UV and solar light at corresponding RSM based 
methodically optimized conditions  for the dyes (AY -17 or RB -220). Optimum 
condition s for the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 at initial 
concentration of 100 mg/L under UV and solar light irradiation are presented in Table 
4.47. For solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dye, a verage UV and visible 
light intensity of solar light= 3.61 mW/cm2 and 1215×100 lux respectively from 11 
a.m. to 1 p.m.  
 Figure 4.78 presents the time course variation of percentage removal of TOC 
during photocatalytic degradation of the dyes (AY -17 and RB -220) under UV and 
solar light. As shown i n Figure 4.78, percentage removal of TOC of AY -17 and RB -
220 increases as the irradiation time increases. As it can be seen from Figure 4.78a, 
within 60 min of irradiation time TOC removal of around 88 % and 89 % occurred 
under UV and solar light respectiv ely during the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17. 
There is no much variation in TOC removal occurred after, even upto 120 min of 
irradiation time.  Figure 4.78b clearly shows that within 60 min of irradiation time 
TOC removal of around 76 % and 79 % occu rred under UV and solar light 
respectively during the photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 and around 87 % and 90 
% TOC removal was observed after 120 min of irradiation respectively.  
 TOC removal in solar photocatalysis is slightly higher than UV photoca talysis 
for RB -220 dye, but for AY -17 dye the TOC removal is similar for both UV and solar 
photocatalysis.  
 Figure 4.79 shows the COD removal during UV and solar photocatalysis of 
AY-17 and RB -220 dyes. As irradiation time increases, percentage COD removal  
during photocatalysis of the dyes increases.  It can be seen from Figure 4.79a, within 
60 min of irradiation time COD removal of around 78 % and 84 % occurred under 
UV and solar light respectively during the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17. 
Around 83 % and 88 % COD removal was observed for AY -17 after 120 min of UV 
and solar irradiation respectively. As observed from Figure 4.79b, within 60 min of 
irradiation time COD removal of around 70 % and 75 % occurred under UV and solar 
light respectively during  the photocatalytic degradation of RB -220. Around 85 % and RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS  
 
 
 
298 
 89 % COD removal was observed for RB -220 after 120 min of UV and solar 
irradiation respectively. However, mineralization was not complete probably due to 
presence of intermediate compounds which we re resistant to UV/solar photocatalytic 
degradation by the Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles or more irradiation time is needed for 
mineralization of these intermediates.  
 Table 4.66 shows the comparison of percentage colour, TOC, and COD 
removal by photocatalysis of  AY-17 and RB -220 obtained with Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles in the present work, with those obtained by photocatalysis of different 
dyes in aqueous solutions using different catalysts reported in literature. As observed 
from Table 4.66 with other catalysts, even  though almost 100 % colour removal 
occurred for most of the dyes, the extent of mineralization and hence the rate of COD 
and TOC removal were found to be much less than  those obtained with Ag@TiO 2 
nanoparticles. Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles exhibited better and  high rate of mineralization 
of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes as compared to TiO 2, which shows the potential of 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles as effective catalysts for the degradation of dyes in waste 
water.

 In order to  further understand if there are inorganic ions released during 
mineralization of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes by UV and solar photocatalysis in the 
presence of Ag@TiO 2 catalyst, t he levels of inorganic ions produced during 
photocatalysis w ere monitored by spectrophotometric method as described in Section 
3.6. The mineralization leads to conversion of organic carbon into harmless CO 2 and 
conversion of sulphur and nitrogen heteroatoms into inorganic ions such as sulphate, 
nitrate ions respect ively (Houas et al. 2001). Figure 4.80 to 4.83 show the time course 
variation of inorganic ions formed (sulphate, nitrate, nitrite and chloride respectively) 
during photocatalytic degradation of the dyes (AY -17 and RB -220 respectively under 
UV and solar li ght.  
 As shown in Figure 4.80a, concentration of sulphate ions has increased as the 
irradiation time increased and around 211 mg/L and 196 mg/L sulphate ions 
formation occurred within 60 min of irradiation time during UV and solar 
photocatalysis of AY -17 respect ively. After 120 min of irradiation, around 214 mg/L 
and 224 mg/L sulphate formation was observed during UV and solar photocatalysis of 
AY-17 dye respectively. Similar observations have been reported by other researchers 
during the degradation of AY -17 dye  using TiO 2 (Tanaka et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2006). 
As seen from Figure 4.80b i n case of RB -220, sulphate ion levels increase as 
irradiation time is increased and around 115 mg/L and 118 mg/L of sulphate ion 
formation occurred within 60 min; around 204 mg/L  and 207 mg/L in 120 min of UV 
and solar light irradiation respectively. Similar observations have been reported by 
Mahmoodi et al. (2006) during the degradation of RB -220 dye using TiO 2. Formation 
of high concentrations of sulphate ions was observed, whic h may be due to the use of 
ammonium persulphate as oxidant in the reaction mixture. Muruganandham and 
Swaminathan, (2004, 2006 a,b) have reported that, when persulphate was used as an 
oxidant it lead to the formation of sulphate ions as described below:  
(i) Persulphate ion can trap the conduction band electron and results in the formation 
of (SO 4•− and sulphate ion SO 42-)  
S2O82− + e−
(CB)→ SO 4•− + SO 42−               (4.9)  
The sulphate radical ion (SO 4•−) produced can add hydrogen to the unsaturated 
carbon, subtracts hydrogen from the saturated carbon or it can remove electrons from RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 the carboxylate anion and from certain neutral molecules of dye. In addition, it can 
trap the conduction band electrons and/ or generate hydroxyl radical and sulphate ion  
SO 4•− + e−
(CB)→ SO 42−              (4.10)  
SO 4•−+ H 2O→ •OH +  SO 42− + H+             (4.11)  
The unique nature of the SO 4•−also increases the fragmentation of the dye molecules 
by attacking at various position and  result in the formation of sulphate ion  
SO 4•− + dye → SO 42− + dye+• (intermediates)            (4.12)  
SO 4•− + dye+• (intermediates) → SO 42− + CO 2 + HNO 3 + other inorganics         (4.13)  
 Since formation of sulphate ions increased with the irradiation time, it is 
proposed that the SO 3Na group would break from the dye molecule and be 
mineralized in the solution in the form of sulphate ion during the photocatalytic 
degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 under UV and solar light irradiation.  
 Figure 4.81 shows the time course variation of formation of nitrate ion during 
photocatalytic degradation of the dyes (AY -17 and RB -220) under UV and solar light. 
As seen from Figure 4.81a, concentration of nitr ate ions during photocatalysis of AY -
17 dye increases, as the irradiation time increases and 1.51 mg/L and 1.7 mg/L nitrate 
ion formation occurred within 60 min of irradiation time under UV and solar light 
respectively. After 120 min of UV and solar irradi ation, 1.64 mg/L and 1.9 mg/L 
nitrate formation was observed during photocatalysis of AY -17 dye respectively. 
Similar observations have been reported by other researchers during degradation of 
AY-17 dye using TiO 2 (Tanaka et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2006). As seen from Figure 
4.81b, i n case of photocatalysis of RB -220, nitrate ion levels increase as irradiation 
time increases both under UV and solar light irradiation. 1.14 mg/L and 1.4 mg/L 
nitrate levels were observed within 60 min of irradiation time under UV  and solar 
light respectively. After 120 min of UV and solar irradiation, nitrate levels reached to 
1.4 mg/L and 1.71 mg/L respectively by photocatalysis of RB -220 dye. Similar 
observations have been reported by Mahmoodi et al. (2006) in degradation of RB -220 
dye using TiO 2. Since formation of nitrate ions increased with the irradiation time, it 
is proposed that the azo group would break from the dye molecule and be mineralized RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 in the solution in the form of nitrate ion during the photocatalytic degradation  of AY -
17 and RB -220 under UV and solar light irradiation.  
 Figure 4.82 shows the time course variation of formation of chloride ion 
during photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 dye under UV and solar light. The result 
presented in Figure 4.82 shows that chl oride levels increase as the reaction time 
increases during photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 under UV and solar light. 
Around 6 mg/L and 8 mg/L of chloride ion formation occurred within 60 min of 
irradiation time during photocatalysis of AY -17 under UV and solar light 
respectively. The chloride levels increased to 10 mg/L and 12 mg/L after 120 min of 
UV and solar irradiation respectively, during the photocatalysis of AY -17 dye.  Wang, 
(2000) in their study on eight dyes with sunlight mediated photocataly tic treatment, 
proposed that the chlorine atom would break from the dye molecule and be released 
into the solution depending on the bonding position. The chlorine would break most 
easily if it is bonded in straight chain of the dye molecule followed by the  site bonded 
in benzene ring; the chemical stability of the chlorine bonding structure is the key. 
Similar observations have been reported by other researchers during degradation of 
AY-17 dye using TiO 2 (Tanaka et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2006). No chloride ion 
formation occurs during photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 under UV and solar 
light irradiation as RB -220 has no chlorine atom in its molecule.  
 Figure 4.83 shows time course variation of the format ion of nitrite ion during 
photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 dye under UV and solar light. The 
concentration of nitrite ions increased as the irradiation time increased, during the 
photocatalysis of RB -220. Around 38 mg/L and 48 mg/L of nitrite ions were  formed 
within 60 min of irradiation time under UV and solar light respectively. The nitrite 
levels increased to around 50 mg/L and 61 mg/L after 120 min of UV and solar light 
irradiation respectively during the photocatalysis of RB -220. Since formation of  
nitrite ions increased with the irradiation time, it is proposed that the azo group in RB -
220 would break from the dye molecule and be mineralized in the solution in the form 
of nitrite ion during the photocatalytic degradation of RB -220 under UV and sola r 
light irradiation.  
 No nitrite formation occurred during photocatalytic degradation of AY -17

 So, formation of inorganic ions (sulphate, nitrate, nitrite and chloride) during 
photocatalysis of dyes using Ag@TiO 2 indicates that the non -biodegradable organic 
part of the dyes AY -17 and RB -220 were destroyed, decomposed  and even 
mineralized during the UV and solar photocatalytic process. High TOC and COD 
removal indicates that AY -17 and RB -220 degrade to simpler and easily 
biodegradable organic compounds by photocatalysis with Ag@TiO 2.

4.14 Treatment of mixture of dyes in contaminated water at RSM based 
methodically optimized conditions for single dye solution (AY -17 or RB -220) by 
UV and solar photocatal ysis  
 
Wastewater from textile industries may contain mixture of dyes and the presence of 
other dye may interfere with the degradation of a specific dye. If the wastewater 
treatment process is operated at optimum conditions derived for one of the dyes and if 
the photocatalytic reactor is also designed based on kinetics at optimum conditions for 
one of the dyes, then the degradation of the other dye may not be complete, as these 
optimum conditions may not favor the degradation of the other dye. So the 
photocatalysi s of mixture of the two dyes in solution were tested for the degradation 
of both the dyes under optimum conditions devised for each of the dyes, so as to test 
the applicability of optimized conditions for the treatment of water contaminated with  
mixture of  dyes. Photocatalysis with mixture of dyes has been hardly reported so far. 
In the present work, the experiments were carried out on the photocatalytic 
degradation of mixtures of two azo dyes AY -17 and RB -220, by using the Ag@TiO 2

 methodically optimized conditions obtained for each of the dyes when present as 
single dye system, as reported in Section 4.8. Optimum conditions for the 
photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 in single dye system, under UV and 
solar light irradiation are shown in Table 4.47. Batch photocatalytic experiments were 
conducted with 100 mL of the dye solution and with the dye concentration 
combination as specified in Section 3.14.  
 
4.14.1 Treatment of m ixture of dyes in contaminated water at RSM based 
methodically optimized conditions for AY -17 dye and RB -220 by UV 
photocatalysis  
 
Batch photocatalysis experiments were performed with different dye concentration 
combination of AY -17 and RB -220 in aqueous mixed dye solution as specified in 
Table 3.7. under UV light irradiation and at the RSM based methodical optimized 
conditions obtained for each of the dyes The optimum conditions for AY -17 
degradation by UV photocatalysis were: pH=2.9, catalyst loading= 3. 4 g/L and 
ammonium persulfate= 2.25 g/L for AY -17 under UV light. Similarly the optimum 
conditions for RB -220 degradation by UV photocatalysis were: pH=3.2, catalyst 
loading= 1.8 g/L and ammonium persulfate= 1.3 g/L. The optimized conditions 
chosen in thes e experiments were the optimum values as obtained by RSM based 
methodical optimization. In all the experiments 100 mL volume of aqueous dye 
solution was used. Table 4.67 shows the percentage degradation of each of the dyes in

AY-17 dye and RB -220 dye with different concentration combinations of the dyes. 
Table 4.67 also presents the percentage degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 under 
optimum conditions for their degradation, when  they are present in a single dye 
system.  
 It can be observed from Table 4.67, under optimized conditions for AY -17 
dye, degradation of RB -220 is higher than that which occurred at optimized 
conditions for RB -220 itself. More than 99.5 % of degradation of  RB-220 could be 
achieved at all the initial dye concentration combinations and the percentage 
degradation of RB -220 was found to be higher at optimized conditions of AY -17 dye RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 as compared to the optimized conditions for RB -220 dye. But under optimized 
conditions for RB -220 dye, the degradation of AY -17 in the mixed dye solution is 
much lesser at all the dye concentration combinations. It is also observed, the 
percentage degradation of AY -17 dye in mixed dye solution is lesser than the 
percentage degradatio n in single dye system, even though the concentrations of AY -
17 are the same both in mixed and single dye solution. Similarly the percentage 
degradation of RB -220 dye in mixed dye solution is lesser than the percentage 
degradation in single dye system, eve n though the concentrations of RB -220 are the 
same both in mixed and single dye solution.  The rate of degradation of each of the 
dyes in a mixture was found to be inhibited by the presence of the other dye. This 
shows that the presence of one dye in the mi xture reduces the rate of degradation of 
other dye and it is due to competitive nature of both the dyes for the reactive site (Ong 
et al. 2013) on Ag@TiO 2 surface.  
 In the mixed dye solution, when the AY -17 concentration was 100 mg/L and 
when the RB -220 c oncentration was increased from 100 mg/L to 400 mg/L, the 
percentage degradation of both RB -220 and AY -17 have decreased. This shows that, 
the competitive nature of inhibition increases with the increase in the concentration of 
the other dye. It also indic ates that increase in initial concentration of a particular dye 
leads to decrease in its percentage degradation.  It may be because the optimum 
catalyst loading used in these experiments were for initial dye concentration of 100 
mg/L. If the initial concen tration of the dye increases, then the available active sites 
on the catalyst may not be adequate for increased number of dye molecules and more 
of dye molecules compete for the active sites. Due to large number of dye molecules 
being present, the rate of achievement of successful collisions on to the active sites  
may reduce and hence leading to lower rate of degradation.

methodical optimized conditions for AY -17 dye and RB -220 by sola r 
photocatalysis

 specified in Table 3.7, under solar light irradiation and at the RSM based methodical 
optimized conditions obtained for each of the dyes The optimum conditions for AY -
17 degradation by solar photocatalysis were: pH=2.1, catalyst loading= 1.8 g/L and 
ammonium persulfate= 2.71 g/L under solar light. Similarly the optimum conditions 
for RB -220 deg radation by solar photocatalysis were: pH=3.3, catalyst loading= 1.11 
g/L and ammonium persulfate= 1.36 g/L. For solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -
220 dye, a verage UV and visible light intensity of solar light= 3.64 mW/cm2 and 
1223×100 lux respectively from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The optimized conditions chosen in 
these experiments were the optimum values as obtained by RSM based methodical 
optimization. In all the experiments 100 mL volume of aqueous dye solution was 
used. Tabl e 4.68 shows the percentage degradation of each of the dyes in the mixed 
dye solution, obtained at the end of 180 min, at optimum conditions for AY -17 dye 
and RB -220 dye with different concentration combinations of the dyes. Table 4.68 
also presents the pe rcentage degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 under optimum 
conditions for their degradation, when they are present in a single dye system. The 
results obtained in solar photocatalysis of mixed dye solution are similar to those 
obtained with UV photocatalysis, as evident from Table 4.68 .  
Studies on mixture of dyes showed that the optimum conditions for AY -17 were more 
favorable for the degradation of both the dyes in mixed dye solution, as compared to 
optimum conditions for RB -220 dye, both in UV and solar phot ocatalysis. The 
optimum conditions for RB -220 are suboptimal for AY -17, as the molecular structure 
of AY -17 is more complex as compared with the RB -220.  Hence the optimized 
conditions obtained for RB -220 degradation are milder than those for AY -17. The 
milder optimum conditions for RB -220 dye are suboptimal for the degradation of the 
complex AY -17 dye. So, when mixtures of dyes are present in wastewater, it is 
recommended to use optimum conditions of the most complex dye for photocatalysis.

4.15 Determination of colour in Hazen unit  
 
According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB 2010) of India, colour of the 
dye contaminated water is specified in terms of Hazen unit and maximum permissible 
limit is set at 400 HU. To check for whether the colour of water contaminated with 
the dyes under study were reduced by photocatalysis and meet specified colour RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 standard, batch UV and solar photocatalysis experiments were conducted with single 
and mixed dye solutions at RSM based methodically optimized conditions for each of 
the dyes and the colo ur was measured in terms of Hazen unit. Table 4.69 shows the 
colour of single dye solution (AY -17 or RB -220) in terms of Hazen unit after 
treatment by UV and solar photocatalysis at their corresponding RSM based 
methodically optimized conditions after 15 m in of irradiation. The RSM based 
methodically optimized conditions for the dyes are shown in Table 4.47. The colour 
of water contaminated with any single dye, after treatment by UV and solar 
photocatalysis were found to be much less than the specified perm issible limit of 400 
HU.  
 Table 4.70 shows the time course variation of colour of the mixed dye solution 
with AY -17 and RB -220 each at 100 mg/L concentration in terms of Hazen unit (HU) 
at RSM based methodical optimized conditions for AY -17 by UV photocat alysis. 
After 180 min of UV irradiation, the colour of the treated water containing mixture of 
dyes was found to be 2.97 HU which is much lesser than the specified permissible 
limit. It is also observed in Table 4.71, which presents the time course variati on of 
colour of the mixed dye solution with AY -17 and RB -220 (AY -17+RB -220= 400 and 
100 mg/L) in terms of Hazen unit (HU) at optimized conditions for AY -17 by UV 
photocatalysis, that after 180 min of UV irradiation, the colour of the treated water 
containi ng mixture of dyes was found to be 271.74 HU which is less than the 
specified permissible limit. Similar observations were made during the treatment of 
mixed dye solution containing 100 mg/L of AY -17 and 400 mg/L of RB -220 dyes by 
UV photocatalysis, as pre sented in Table 4.72.  
 Table 4.73 to Table 4.75 show the time course variation of colour of the 
solution in terms of HU during solar photocatalysis of the mixed dye solution at 
different concentrations of (i) 100 mg/L each (ii) 400 mg/L AY -17 and 100 mg/L  RB-
220 (iii) 100 mg/L AY -17 and 400 mg/L RB -220, respectively under RSM based 
methodical optimized conditions for AY -17. After 180 min of solar irradiation, the 
colour of the treated water containing mixture of dyes was found to be less than the 
specified  permissible limit, in all the cases.

methodically optimized conditions for RB -220 dye. After 180 min of solar irradiation, 
colour of the treated water containing mixture of dyes was found to be less th an the 
specified permissible limit, in all the cases. Table 4.79 -4.81 shows the time course 
variation of colour of the solution in terms of HU during solar photocatalysis of the 
mixed dye solution at different concentrations of (i) 100 mg/L each (ii) 400 m g/L AY -
17 and 100 mg/L RB -220 (iii) 100 mg/L AY -17 and 400 mg/L RB -220, respectively 
under RSM based methodically optimized conditions. As observed from these Tables, 
the colour of the treated water containing mixture of dyes is less than the specified 
permissible limit of 400 HU. It can also observed from Tables 4.70 and  Table 4.71, in 
mixed dye solution containing 400 mg/L of AY -17 and 100 mg/L of RB -220 the 
colour is 3226.56 HU and in mixed dye solution with 100 mg/L of AY -17 and 400 
mg/L of RB -220, the  colour is  1333.7. It shows that AY -17 dye contributes largely to 
the colour of contaminated water as compared to RB -220 dye. Rate of decolourization 
by solar photocatalysis was found to be faster than that with UV photocatalysis, as 
observed from Table 4 .70 to Table 4.80. This study showed that at optimum 
conditions for both the dyes, colour of the treated water with single dye and mixture 
of dyes was found to be less than the permissible limit of 400 HU, specified by 
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB  2010) of India, even at the high concentration 
of the dyes. Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were found to be efficient photocatalysts for 
treatment of wastewaters contaminated with dyes by UV and solar photocatalysis and 
they can be effectively utilized for decolou rization of wastewater to meet the 
stipulated standards.

4.16 Possible reaction mechanism and degradation pathway of solar 
photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dye  
 
As the studies presented in earlier Sections revealed that solar photocatalysis using 
Ag@TiO 2 is more effective than UV photocatalysis, the mechanism of photocatalysis 
and the reaction pathway of degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 were proposed 
through identification of intermediates formed during solar photocat alysis of these 
dyes by LC -MS analysis. The possible intermediates were identified by interpretation 
of their fragment ions mass to charge (m/z) ratio in the mass spectra. The LC -MS 
analysis of the samples collected for every 15 min during solar photocatal ysis of AY -
17 and RB -220 conducted under RSM based methodically optimized conditions was 
performed.  The mass spectra of intermediates formed are shown in Appendix VII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 The possible reaction mechanisms for solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 are 
propos ed on the basis of the experimentally identified intermediate species.  
 Highly reactive hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals are produced during 
photocatalysis and are found to be responsible for the degradation of the dyes into 
simpler compounds (e.g., water -soluble organic acids). In some cases, complete 
mineralization into ions (NO 3-, and SO 42-) also occurred. Although OH radicals are 
indiscriminate, nonspecific oxidants, LC -MS studies of dye -degradation products 
have revealed distinct patterns in the degradation process. The following Sections 
discuss the possible mechanisms that are proposed for splitting of AY -17 and RB -220 
organic -dye molecules into simpler components and the loss of small entities.  
 
4.16.1 Generation and attack of •OH radical  
 
Whe n Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticle is exposed to light, electrons are promoted from the 
valence band to conduction band and result in the formation of an electron –hole pair. 
Further electron can migrate to the Ag core and get discharged when an oxidant such 
as O 2 is supplied (Hirakawa and Kamat 2005). As shown in Figure 4.84 (Eqs. (1) and 
(2)), the photo excited electrons are penetrated or transferred quickly through TiO 2 
shell into the Ag nano core until the Fermi level charge equilibrium is attained 
between the shell and core systems, after which the electrons are facilitated to quickly 
transfer from excited TiO 2, initiating the redox reactions at the interface of TiO 2 shell 
and dye solution (Abdulla -Al-Mamun et al. 2010). Further e lectrons can easily react 
with O 2 and form active species H 2O2, O 2•-, HO 2• (Sung -Suh et al. 2004)  which 
considerably advance the photocatalytic degradation of dyes. These active species 
further  react and produce hydroxyl radical (.OH). In addition, it was reported that 
holes react with adsorbed water molecules, leading to the production of •OH as shown 
in equations (3) –(4) (Jaeger and Bard 1979; Cai et al. 1992). On the photoexcitation 
of Ag@TiO 2, reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen 
peroxide etc. are formed which are highly oxidizable species and expected to be 
responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes (Abdulla -Al-Mamun et al. 
2010). Redox potential of •OH radical is very high (E ◦ + 2.8 V) thus it is a powerful RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 oxidizing agent and attacks the dye molecules present at or near the surface of TiO 2 to 
oxidize it.  
 
4.16.2 Degradation pathway of AY -17 
 
Based on LC -MS analysis and the mass to charge ratio obtained  from mass spectra, 
the intermediate compounds were identified and the possible degradation pathway of 
AY-17 was proposed. The proposed pathway is shown in Figure 4.85.The process of 
degradation of AY -17 dye is initiated by either removal of SO 3Na or remov al of 
sodium sulphate from the AY -17 dye. Next step in AY -17 dye degradation is then 
initiated by attack of hydroxyl radicals. The AY -17 dye later may undergo cleavage of 
C–N bond or symmetrical cleavage of azo bond.  
 
Cleavage of C -N bond  
 
The first pathw ay involves the cleavage of C –N bond between benzene ring and azo 
bond and resulting in formation of intermediates A and E shown in Table 4.82. The 
compound A having benzene ring intact undergoes cleavage of azo bond to form the 
intermediate B.  
 
Reductive  symmetrical cleavage of azo bond of AY -17 
 
The presence of Π -bonds in the azo groups makes them the preferred site of OH 
radical attack (Karkmaz et al. 2004; Ozen et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2008b; Erdemoglu 
et al. 2008). The addition products of hydroxyl ra dicals to N=N are among the first 
intermediates to be detected during the progress of an OH radical -mediated 
degradation. The addition can occur on either of the two nitrogen atoms. However, it 
has been reported that there is a preferential attack on elect ron-deficient nitrogen, as 
exemplified by Meetani et al. (2010). So the second degradation pathway involves the 
reduction and symmetrical cleavage of azo bond and results in formation of 
intermediate B, C, D, F, G, and H shown in Table 4.82. The intermedia tes may further 
be mineralized to form simpler inorganic compounds on prolonged irradiation. The RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

is shown in Figure 4.85 and can be briefly summarized as follows:  
                                                  
                                                                                                       
 
4.16.3 Degradation pathway of RB -220 
 
The process of degradatio n of RB -220 dye is initiated by decomplexation of co -
ordination bond from the dye which further may undergo cleavage of C –N bond as 
shown in Figure 4.86 (Scheme 1). This pathway results in formation of intermediates 
A, B, and C and their chemical names are  given in Table 4.83.  
 
Decomplexation and cleavage of C -N bond  
 
This pathway involves the decomplexation of coordination bond and cleavage of C -N 
bond resulting in formation of intermediates A, B, and C as shown in Scheme 1. The 
compounds A and B further u ndergo oxidation which leads to formation of different 
intermediates as shown in Figure 4.87 and Figure 4.88 (scheme 2 and 3). Table 4.83 
shows the chemical names of intermediates produced during the photocatalytic 
degradation of RB -220 dye.  
 
Devinylsulpho nation  
 
The pathway involves the removal of vinylsulfone group leading to the formation of 
intermediate compound D. Similar observation was reported by Bansal and Sud, 
(2013) during the photocatalytic degradation of Reactive Red 35. The intermediates 
may further be mineralized to form simpler inorganic compounds on prolonged 
irradiation. The complete degradation pathway of Ag@TiO 2 mediated solar 
photocatalysis of RB -220 can be briefly summarized as follows:

 4.17 Photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 using immobilized 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles  
  
4.17.1 Comparison of photocatalytic activity of free Ag@TiO 2 with immobilized 
nanoparticles for photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 
 
 When catalyst used in the form of powder slurries, the major problems are: (a) 
the need for separation or filtration steps, (b) problems of particle wash out in 
continuous flow systems and (c) the particles aggregation, especially at high 
concentrations (Fujishima et al. 2000). To overcome these drawbacks, nanoparti cles 
can be immobilized on supports in photocatalytic reactors. In the present study, 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were immobilized on two polymer supports that are chitosan 
and cellulose acetate for the photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220. It was 
found that compared to UV, under solar light rate of photocatalysis was very high, as 
discussed in Section 4.3, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.8. Catalyst loading required for solar 
photocatalysis is much lesser than that used in UV photocatalysis for both the dyes as 
shown i n Table 4.47 and in Section 4.8. This showed higher efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 for 
solar photocatalysis. Hence the efficacy of immobilized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles was 
tested in terms of degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 by solar photocatalysis. The 
solar photocatalys is experiments were conducted using RSM based methodical 
optimized conditions of both dyes (AY -17 and RB -220) as shown in Table 4.47. The 
average UV and visible light intensity of solar light= 3.59 mW/cm2 and 1220×100 lux 
respectively from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m . Experiments were also conducted with only 
chitosan beads and cellulose acetate films in order to confirm that the degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 from contaminated water, in the presence of light is due to 
photocatalysis. It was observed from the results , no adsorption of dyes on chitosan 
beads and cellulose acetate film took place. Figure 4.89 shows the time course 
variation of immobilized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles with chitosan and cellulose acetate 
for the degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 under solar light. As observed from Figure 
4.89, the rate of photocatalysis with immobilized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles is lesser 
than that with the free catalyst. The ph otocatalytic process is a surface phenomenon, 
so easy access to light irradiation and dye is essential for successful photocatalytic RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

 degradation. Immobilized system offers diffusional limitations for the transfer of dye 
molecules on to the catalyst surface . Light absorption by Ag@TiO 2 is hindered due to 
immobilization. So as compared to free Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles, low initial rate of 
degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dye was observed with immobilized nanoparticles. 
Though the amount of nanoparticles used with  chitosan beads and cellulose acetate 
films were the same, the number of cellulose acetate film particles supporting the 
catalyst was more than the number of chitosan beads supporting the catalyst. Higher 
number of support particles in the reactor system, would have lead to hindrance to 
light penetration in case of cellulose acetate, hence leading to lower rate of 
degradation as compared to that with chitosan beads as the support. Also it was 
observed during experimentation, Chitosan -Ag@TiO 2 beads  were more  transparent as 
compared to Cellulose Acetate -Ag@TiO 2 films. Lower transparency of cellulose 
Acetate -Ag@TiO 2 films may hinder the light penetration and compactness of the film 
may decrease the intraparticle diffusion of the dyes in the polymer matrix and h ence 
reducing the ease with which the dye molecules reach the nanoparticles embedded in 
the matrix. Almost complete degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 could be achieved 
within 60 min of irradiation time with both free and immobilized nanoparticles. It 
depicts  that the efficacy of immobilized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles are comparable with 
free catalyst, in spite of the diffusional and light penetration limitations of 
immobilized system. From the results of investigations carried out in the present 
study, it can be c oncluded that the immobilized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles have similar 
efficacy as free nanoparticles for to act as photocatalysts in degradation of AY -7 and 
RB-220 dyes and Chitosan -Ag@TiO 2 beads are the better immobilization matrix as 
compared to Cellulose Ace tate-Ag@TiO 2 films.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

4.17.2 Recycling of immobilized Ag@TiO 2 
 
 In order to check for any loss of activity of the immobilized catalyst and 
feasibility of their reuse for repeated photocatalysis, similar experiments were carried 
out as discussed previously under solar light irradiation. After an experiment with a 
fresh immobilized catalyst, the nanoparticles were reused twice for degradation 
experiments. So totally the nanoparticles were used for three cycles, out of which the 
first cycle was with the fresh immobilized catalyst and the remaining two cycles were 
with the recycled immobilized catalysts. Before the use of immobilized catalyst in the 
next cycle of experiment, the immobilized catalyst was separated from the treated 
water by filtration and then washed thrice with distilled water. After filtration, the 
immobiliz ed particles were dried in room temperature for 2 h and then used for the 
next cycle of batch experiments. For all the three cycles same experimental conditions 
were used. Figure 4.90 to 4.91 present the time course variation of % degradation of

 immobilized particles of single prior use (Cycle II), and immobilized particles of two 
prior uses (Cycle III) under solar light irradiation. As seen from Figure 4.90, after 
three cycles of re use of Chitosan -Ag@TiO 2 beads, decrease in photocatalytic activity 
of AY -17 from 99.89 to 93.46 % and for RB -220 from 99.93 to 95.12 % was 
observed after 120 min of solar light irradiation. As it can be observed from Figure 
4.91, after three cycles of reus e of Cellulose Acetate -Ag@TiO 2 film, decrease in 
photocatalytic activity of AY -17 from 99.72 to 87.43 % and for RB -220 from 99.92 to 
91.36 % was observed after 120 min of solar light irradiation. Also it was observed, 
initial rate of photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 slightly decreased after three cycle 
of reuse of immobilized particles which may be due to the adsorption of dye molecule 
on the immobilized support (chitosan and cellulose acetate). Not much reduction in 
activity was found after three cycles of reuse. So it can be concluded that Ag@TiO 2 
immobilized on chitosan or cellulose acetate can be recycled without much decline in 
activity.

4.18 Efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 as a photocatalyst for degradation of other class of 
dyes under solar light irradiation  
 
Batch experiments were performed in order to check the photocatalytic efficacy of 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles for the degradation of other dyes belonging to different 
classes, like : Basic Blue -41 (basic azo dye), Malachite Green (triarylmethane dye), 
Acid Blue -129 (anthraquinone dye), Congo Red (diazo dye), Reactive Red -120 
(reactive diazo dye), Methy l Orange (acid azo dye), Methyl Red (acid azo dye), and 
Methylene Blue ( thi- azine dye) . Experiments were performed under solar light with 
catalyst loading=100 mg/L and initial dye concentration=10 mg/L. The average UV 
and visible light intensity of solar light= 3.59 mW/cm2 and 1220×100 lux respectively 
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Experiments were done at different initial pH, depending upon 
the nature of dyes. pH of 3 was used for acidic dyes and 9 for basic dyes. Experiments 
were done at different initial pH d ue to the amphoteric character of TiO 2. The point of 
zero charge (pzc) of TiO 2 is 6.8 (pH pzc), so the surface of the particles is positively 0 20 40 60 80 100

 charged when pH < pH pzc.. Above this value it is negatively charged (pH > pH pzc) 
whereas it is neutral when pH = pH pzc (Chiou et al. 2008). As anionic dye molecules 
will be negatively charged at lower pH hence more degradation of dye will occur due 
to the charge difference between negatively charged dye molecule and positively 
charged catalyst. Similarly for cationic d ye, molecules will be positively charged at 
higher pH hence more degradation of dye will occur due to the charge difference 
between positively charged dye molecule and negatively charged catalyst. Table 4.84 
shows the conditions used for the photocatalysis  and the percentage degradation of the 
dyes. Results showed almost complete degradation of all the dyes under solar light 
irradiation. It can be seen from Table 4.84, with in 60 min of solar irradiation almost 
complete degradation of Congo Red, Methyl Orange and Methyl Red were observed 
whereas for Basic Blue -41, Malachite Green, Reactive Red -120 (reactive diazo dye) 
and Methylene Blue ( thi- azine dye)  it took around 180 min for almost complete 
degradation of dyes. Almost complete degradation of Acid Bl ue-129 was observed 
within 150 min of solar irradiation. Ag@TIO 2 was found be an efficient photocatalyst 
not only for the degradation of azo dyes such as AY -17 and RB -220, but also for the 
degradation of other class of dyes. The difference in efficacy of A g@TiO 2 for 
degradation of different dyes, as indicated by varied time of irradiation to achieve 
greater than 98 % degradation depicting the  variations in the rate of photocatalysis, 
may be due the varied degree of complexity of dye structures. However, th is study 
proves the ability of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles to degrade almost all class of dyes and 
hence can be exploited efficiently for treatment of textile wastewater and other 
industrial effluents contaminated with dyes.

 The research work presented in this report, shows the efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 core shell 
structured nanoparticles as a photocatalyst, for the removal of two azo dyes: AY -17 
and RB -220 from contaminated water by batch photocatalytic degradation. The 
nanoparticles were synthesized by one pot synthesis route and the Ag to Ti molar rat io 
used in the synthesis mixture during the synthesis Ag@TiO 2 core shell structured 
nanoparticles, calcination temperature and calcination time for the photocatalysts 
were optimized to impart and enhance UV and solar photocatalytic activity to these 
nanopa rticles in terms of photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes. 
These nanoparticles were assessed for their suitability as photocatalyst for degradation 
of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes by photocatalysis under UV and solar light irradiation. 
The nanoparti cles were characterized for their size, structure, morphology, 
composition, crystallinity, thermal characteristics and light absorption characteristics 
and an attempt has been made to explain their UV and solar photocatalytic behavior.  
The e fficacy of Ag@ TiO 2 core shell nanoparticles as photocatalyst was tested and 
compared with those of other commercial and synthesized catalysts. Effects of 
operational factors were investigated and optimization of operational factors for UV 
and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes were carried out using RSM 
through experiments designed as per CCD. Studies on kinetics of degradation, effect 
of presence of salts, effect of light intensity, mineralization of the dyes, degradation 
pathway, the treatment of water conta minated with mixture of dyes, degradation with 
immobilized nanoparticles, reuse of free and immobilized nanoparticles for repeated 
photocatalysis were carried out.  Efficacy of Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles for the 
degradation of other class of dyes was also studi ed.  
 
Based on the investigation reported in this report, following conclusions were drawn.  
 Ag@TiO 2 core-shell nanoparticles synthesized by one pot synthesis route 
were engineered to impart and enhance UV and solar photocatalytic activity 
and those synthesized with Ag to Ti molar ratio of 1:1.7 in the synthesis 
mixture and calcined at 450 ˚C for 3 h were  found to exhibit maximum solar 
and UV photocatalytic activity in terms of degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 
dyes and hence these synthesis and calcination conditions were considered as 
the optimum.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  
 
 
 
340 
  The removal of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes from contaminated wate r, in the 
presence of Ag@TiO 2 core-shell nanoparticles and under UV or solar light 
irradiation was attributed to photocatalysis of the dyes. Hence these core -shell 
nanoparticles are  considered as the effective photocatalyst for the degradation 
of azo dyes such as AY -17 and RB -220 by UV and solar photocatalysis. These 
nanoparticles are hence suitable for treatment of water contaminated with 
these dyes.  
 The engineered Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were characterized by TEM and 
AFM, which revealed the formation of Ag core and TiO 2 shell. Ag core and 
TiO 2 shell were found to be crystalline in nature as confirmed by XRD and 
SAED results. The average crystallite size calculated by Scherrer’s formula 
being 39.40 nm, was in close agreement with the average particle size of 37.33 
nm obtained by TEM and showed reasonable match with the average particle 
size obtained by particle size analysis with AFM. The EDS spectrum showed 
the presence of O, Ti and Ag elements.  
 TG-DTA analysis indicated the possible phase conversion from am orphous to 
anatase TiO 2 at around 350 °C, surface hydroxyl groups dissociation in the 
range of 350 –600 °C and conversion from anatase to rutile phase of TiO 2 at 
around 514 °C.  
 DRS indicated that Ag@TiO 2 is able to absorb both UV light and visible light, 
maximum visible light absorption being at 509 nm. Band gap energy of 
Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles was calculated with DRS using Kubelka -Munk model 
and found to be around 1.85eV. It is much lesser than the band gap energy for 
TiO 2 (3.2eV), indicating that the nanoparticles have all the potential to be 
excited by longer wavelength radiations in visible range and hence can be used 
effectively for solar photocatalysis.  
 Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles were found to be more efficient in degradation of 
AY-17 and RB -220 dyes as compared to other catalysts such as Degussa P25, 
synthesized TiO 2 and Ag doped TiO 2 both under UV and solar irradiation.  
 Solar photocatalysis was found to be more ef ficient as compared to UV 
photocatalysis with Ag@TiO 2 catalyst. High photocatalytic activity of SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  
 
 
 
341 
 Ag@TiO 2 is due to its affinity to absorb both UV and visible light radiation 
and low band gap energy of 1.85eV.  
 Initial solution pH, catalyst loading, initial d ye concentration, type and 
concentrations of oxidants added; were found to affect the rate of 
photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 under UV and solar light irradiation.  
 The optimum conditions of pH, catalyst loading and oxidant concentrations 
were obtained f rom crude optimization by “One factor at a time approach”.  
pH of 3 was the optimum  for the degradation of both the dyes under UV and 
solar light irradiation using Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles as catalyst. The optimum 
catalyst loading for the photocatalysis of A Y-17 and RB -220 under UV and 
solar light were obtained and the optimum dye to catalyst ratio for degradation 
of AY -17 under UV and solar light irradiation using Ag@TiO 2 core-shell 
structured nanoparticles were 1:30 and 1:10 (g/g) respectively. Similarly the 
optimum dye to catalyst ratio for degradation of RB -220 under UV and solar 
light irradiation using Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles were 1:20 
and 1:10 (g/g) respectively.  
 Initial dye concentration acted as an independent factor affecting the  rate of 
photocatalysis, even when the dye to catalyst ratio was the optimum.  
 Addition of oxidants such as H 2O2, KBrO 3 and (NH 4)2S2O8 improved the 
photocatalytic degradation of dyes and (NH 4)2S2O8 was found to be the 
effective oxidant as compared to other s.  
 It was found feasible to recycle Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles at least thrice for 
repeated photocatalysis, without much decline in efficiency.  
 Optimum conditions for UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 
were obtained using RSM, based on experiments  designed as per CCD. Rate 
of degradation was found to be enhanced tremendously  with the RSM based 
methodically optimized conditions a s compared to crude optimized conditions. 
Statstically significant multiple regression models were developed to predict 
the percentage degradation of dyes as a function of pH, catalyst loading and 
ammonium persulfate concentration. Interaction effects between these factors 
(pH, catalyst loading and ammonium persulfate concentration) were observed.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  
 
 
 
342 
  Studies on effect of initial  dye concentration showed the effectiveness  of the 
catalyst to degrade the dye solution at high concentrations, with conditions 
optimized for photocatalysis of 100 mg/L of dye. Greater than 95 % 
degradation of AY -17 could be achieved at the end of 360 min irradiation 
time, with upto 400 mg/L dye concentration, both under UV and solar 
photocatalysis. In the case of RB -220 dye, greater than 99 % degradation 
could be achieved with upto 500 mg/L initial dye concentration in 120 min of 
solar light irradiation an d greater than 95% of degradation was achieved with 
upto 400 mg/L initial dye concentration in 240 min of UV light irradiation. It 
is always advisable to design the reactor based on most probable maximum 
dye concentration in the industrial effluent and its  corresponding optimum 
catalyst loading, so that the treated effluent quality will always meet the 
standard.  
 Kinetics of UV and solar photocatalysis of dyes with Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles 
obeyed modified Langmuir -Hinshelwood model and the kinetic parameters fo r 
photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220 dyes were reported. This indicates that 
the rate of degradation of these dyes is determined mainly by the reaction 
occurring on the surface of Ag@TiO 2.  
 Presence of salts like sodium chloride and sodium carbonate inhibi ted the rate 
of UV and solar photocatalysis of AY -17 and RB -220. So it is important to 
take salt concentration in the effluent into consideration while designing the 
photoreactor for treatment of dyeing wastewater  
 Rate of degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 by  photocatalysis, increased with 
increase in UV light intensity.  
 Rate of degradation increased linearly with increase in UV and visible light 
radiation intensity of solar light . 
 High TOC and COD removal indicated that AY -17 and RB -220 dyes degrade 
to simpler and easily biodegradable organic compounds by photocatalysis with 
Ag@TiO 2. 
 Formation of inorganic ions (sulphate, nitrate, nitrite and chloride) indicated 
that the non -biodegradable organic part of AY -17 and RB -220 were destroyed, SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  
 
 
 
343 
 decomposed and ev en mineralized during the UV and solar photocatalytic 
process.  
 Studies on mixture of dyes showed that the optimum conditions for AY -17 
were more favorable for the degradation of both the dyes in mixtures as 
compared to optimum conditions for RB -220 dye, b oth under UV and solar 
photocatalysis. RB -220 could be degraded easily under both the optimum 
conditions, but AY -17 could not be degraded easily under optimum conditions 
for RB -220. The difficulty in degradation of AY -17 as compared to that of 
RB-220 is ow ing to complexity of AY -17 dye structure and optimum 
conditions of RB -220 dye is sub optimal for AY -17 degradation. So, when 
mixtures of dyes are present in wastewater, it is recommended to use optimum 
conditions of the most complex dye for photocatalysis.  
 Colour of the dye contaminated water was also measured in terms of Hazen  
unit during UV and solar photocatalysis of single and binary dye solution 
under optimum conditions and the colour of the treated water were found to be 
less than the permissible limi t of 400 HU, specified by Central Pollution 
Control Board (CPCB, 2010) of India, for the range of initial concentrations 
used in the current study.  
 The intermediates and products of photocatalytic degradation of AY -17 and 
RB-220 were identified through LC -MS analysis and the complete 
degradation pathway of Ag@TiO 2 mediated solar photocatalysis of AY -17 
and RB -220 was proposed. The pathway are briefly summarized as follows:  
                                                   
                        
                                                    
                         
 Almost complete degradation of AY -17 and RB -220 could be achieved with 
both free and immobilized nanoparticles which depicted the nearly 
comparable efficacy of immobilized Ag@TiO 2 nanoparticles with the free 
photocatalyst.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  
 
 
 
344 
  The activity of Ag@TiO 2 immobilized on chitosan and cellulose acetate as 
support matrices, were found almost unaltered after repeated uses. So it can be 
recycled without much decline in activity.  
 Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles were also found suitable for 
photocataly sis of other classes of dyes.  
 
 Hence Ag@TiO 2 core-shell structured nanoparticles may be considered 
as effective catalysts for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes/textile 
wastewater by being more effective than TiO 2 or Ag doped TiO 2 
nanoparticles, due to their ability of prevention of electron -hole recombination 
by storage of electrons in the Ag core, and band gap excitation resulting in 
effective utilization of solar energy for environmental remediation strategies. 
Solar energy utilization and fast kin etics feature of this process makes it an 
economical and favorable option for large scale treatment of dye/textile 
wastewater. However, implementation of the process on a large scale for 
industrial scale applications in industrial wastewater treatment need s further 
research on continuous reactors and live effluents.
