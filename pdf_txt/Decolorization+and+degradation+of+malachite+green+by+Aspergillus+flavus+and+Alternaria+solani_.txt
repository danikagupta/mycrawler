ABSTRACT 
 
Anthraquinone dyes, the second largest class of dye s used extensively in the textile 
industries. But majority of these recalcitrant dyes  are resistant to degradation due to their 
fused aromatic structure. This necessitates the nee d to explore effective treatment systems for 
the degradation of anthraquinone dyes. Though sever al physico-chemical decolorization 
techniques have been reported only few have been ac cepted by the textile industries. Among 
the current remediation technologies, biodegradatio n of these synthetic dyes by different 
microbes is emerging as an effective and promising approach. This review paper focuses on 
the science of various microbial strains and the en zyme systems involved in the bio 
degradation of anthraquinone dye. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Dyestuff sector is one of the most important sector s exposed to great developments in 
the field of textile industries. Around 10 6 tons of dyes are produced annually, of which 1–
1.5*10 5 tons are released to the environment in wastewater (Stolz 2001). These discarded 
dyes remain long-term in the environment and accumu late (Anliker 1979; McMullan et al . 
2001) due to their stability, recalcitrant nature l eading to toxicity, and blocking sunlight for 
photosynthetic processes. The structural diversity of dyes comes from the use of different 
chromophore groups (e.g. azo, anthraquinone, triary lmethane and phthalocyanine groups) and 
different application technologies (e.g. reactive, direct, disperse and vat dyeing) (Heinfling et 
al .,1998).  Azo and anthraquinone are two of the most  common groups of dyes used in 
coloring different textiles.  Reactive anthraquinon e dyes represent the second largest class of 
textile dyes, after azo dyes and are used extensive ly in the textile industry due to their wide INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED RESEARCH IN

 array of color shades, ease of application and mini mal energy consumption (Aspland, 1997). 
Anthraquinone dyes are resistant to degradation and  are toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic 
(Itoh et al ., 1996).The frequently high volumetric rate of ind ustrial effluent discharge in 
combination with increasingly stringent legislation , make the search for appropriate treatment 
technologies an important priority (O’Neill et al . 1999).  The major disadvantages of 
physicochemical methods like adsorption, chemical o xidation, precipitation, coagulation, 
filtration, electrolysis, etc for wastewater treatm ent include the high cost, low efficiency, 
limited versatility and handling of the waste gener ated (Van der Zee and Villaverde et  al.,  
2005). Biological methods are generally considered environment friendly as they can lead to 
complete mineralization of organic pollutants at lo w cost (Pandey et al ., 2007). 
Biodegradation is a promising approach for the reme diation of synthetic dyes wastewater 
because of its cost effectiveness, efficiency, and environment friendly nature (Gopinath et al . 
2009, Jirasripongpun et al . 2007, Shedbalkar et al ., 2008,Verma and Madamwar 2003).It is 
now known that several microorganisms, including fu ngi, bacteria, yeasts, and algae, can 
completely decolorize many anthraquinone dyes. (Pan dey et al . 2007).  
 
1.1 Anthraquinone dye 
 
Anthraquinone dyes represent the second largest cla ss of textile dyes, having the 
chromophore group, =C=O, forming an anthraquinone c omplex. During its manufacture and 
usage of an estimated amount of 10–15% is released into the environment (Chung and 
Stevens 1993). Many of these dyes have been reporte d to convert to harmful compounds such 
as benzidine. Additionally, most of these dyes are toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic (Itoh  et 
al., 1996 ) due to their stability and resistance towards lig ht or oxidizing agents (Lee  et al., 
2005). These dyes in water strongly absorb sunlight , which decreases the intensity of its 
assimilation by aquatic plants and phytoplankton th ereby reducing the self purification 
capacity of water reservoirs. The existing physicoc hemical technologies for textile dye 
removal are expensive, ineffective and commercially  unattractive due to low biodegradability 
of the dyes. Therefore, researchers are currently s eeking to develop more effective treatment 
strategies for the treatment of dye wastewater. A s ignificant amount of research has already 
been done on the decolorization/degradation of azo dyes and their related products (Perey  et 
al., 2002), however, limited information exists in case of anthraquinone dyes and only a few 
published data regarding their degradation pathways . Therefore, effective treatment systems 
of microbial stains for the degradation of anthraqu inone dyes are to be explored. 
 
2. FUNGAL DEGRADATION 
 
The treatment of recalcitrant and toxic dyes, espec ially the anthraquinone group of 
dyes, with traditional technologies is not always e ffective and environmentally friendly. The 
use of bacteria in the biological treatment of dye effluents may result in the generation of 
colorless dead products more toxic than the parent compounds (Banat et al ., 1996, Kulla et 
al ., 1983) and, therefore, may have poor adaptability  and limited application to a wide range 
of dye wastewater (Kulla et al ., 1983). This has impelled the search for alternat ive 
technologies such as biodegradation with fungi whic h are capable of using the dye molecules 
as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. T he use of fungi is becoming a promising 
alternative to replace or complement the current te chnologies for dye removal (Susana 
Rodrguez et al .,2009) as it is an economical and feasible alterna tive to the present treatment International Journal of Advanced Research in Engin eering and Technology (IJARET), ISSN

 technologies (Singh, 2006). In a recent study on fu ngal biodegradation, A.fumigatus XC6  
isolated from rice straw was found to be an efficie nt strain for the decolorization of reactive 
textile dyes effluents at an optimum pH 3.0.  When supplemented with appropriate carbon or 
nitrogen sources significant effect on colour reduc tion was observed (Xian-Chun et al .,2007). 
However some results on co- effect of carbon and ni trogen sources on effluent decolorization 
showed that effluent supplemented with both carbon and nitrogen sources need more time to 
completely decolorize the effluent than those suppl emented with only carbon or nitrogen 
source. This may be due to catabolite repression wh ich thus, delays the decolorization time. 
The single class of microorganisms most efficient i n breaking down synthetic dyes is the 
white-rot fungi (Couto et  al ., 2009). They produce efficient enzymes capable of  degrading a 
wide range of dyes under aerobic conditions (Nozaki  et al.  2008). In addition to their natural 
substrate, white-rot fungi are capable of mineraliz ing a diverse range of persistent organic 
pollutants, which distinguishes them from substrate  specific biodegradative bacteria. (Reddy 
1995). Several studies have described that anthraqu inone dyes are decolorized at higher rates 
than azo dyes by white rot fungi (Abadulla E et al ., 2000; Jarosz-Wilkolazka et al ., 2002). 
Effective decolorizers among mitosporic moulds have  been described by Jarosz- Wilkolazka 
et al ., (2002). The decolorization profiles obtained wit h the most effective aquatic mitosporic 
isolates indicate comprehensive decolorizing abilit ies that are not restricted to certain dyes, 
which proved to be advantageous to the often changi ng dye compositions in real effluents 
(Hao et al., 2000; Pophali et al ., 2003; Wesenberg et al ., 2003).  Radha et al . (2005) found 
that P. chrysosporium  was able to degrade several synthetic dyes of diff erent chromophores 
such as azo, anthraquinone, thiazine and vat dyes i n both free and alginate-immobilised 
cultures with a decolorization percentage higher th an 75%. But many studies reveal that 
processes using immobilized growing cells seem to b e more promising than those with free 
cells, since immobilization allows using the microb ial cells repeatedly and continuously 
(Susana Rodriguez 2009).The results of these findin gs provide important insights into the 
development of effective treatment method for the f ungal degradation of anthraquinone dyes. 
  
3. BACTERIAL DEGRADATION 
  
Microbial degradation of anthraquinone dyes is cons idered to be a subject of great 
interest in environmental chemistry of which consti tute several bacterial species. (Fontenot, 
et al., 2001). Decolorization of dyes may take place either  by biosorption on the microbial 
biomass or biodegradation by cells (Zhou and  Zimmermann 1993). In case of biosorption, the 
original structure of the dyes remains intact, and not degraded into fragments thereby not 
being a practical approach for treating large volum es of dye-contaminated industrial effluents 
due to disposal problems (Kuhad  et al. 2004).  In biodegradation, the original dye structu re is 
destroyed, and the pollutant is split into fragment s by the microbial cells. In a research 
conducted by Suizhou Ren, Jun Guo  et al( 2006 ), the cells of Aeromonas hydrophila  strain 
DN322 remained colorless during the process of deco lorization which attributed to 
biodegradation. This strain isolated from activated  sludge of a textile wastewater treatment 
plant is a highly promising one both for applicatio n in the treatment of industrial wastewater 
and bioremediation of triphenylmethane, azo, and an thraquinone dye pollutants from 
contaminated environment. For color removal, the su itable pH and temperature range were 
pH 5.0–10.0 and 25–37°C, respectively. For azo and anthraquinone dyes Great Red, Reactive 
Red KE-3B, and Reactive Brilliant Blue K-GR (50 mgl−1) decolorization of more than 85% 
within 36h under anoxic condition was observed. How ever, microbial strains capable of International Journal of Advanced Research in Engin eering and Technology (IJARET), ISSN

 utilizing the dye as sole source of carbon and ener gy for their growth are of special interest as 
they eliminate the pollutant in a real sense and co nvert the undesirable chemicals into 
harmless and useful product (Ali et al ., 2009).  
 
4. ALGAL DEGRADATION  
 
In recent years, the use of algae in bioremediation  of colored waste water has attracted 
great interest (Caparkaya & Cavas, 2008; Kumar et al ., 2005). Being a cheap source of 
biosorbent,  readily available in large quantities,  they also offer a large surface area and have 
been proven to be an effective biosorbent in the tr eatment of wastewater (Aravindham et al ., 
2006; Daneshvar et al., 2007, Mohan et al ., 2002; Ozer et al.,  2006;, Schiewer and Wong, 
2000). Biosorption by using algae has mainly been a ttributed to the cell wall properties where 
both electrostatic attraction and complexation can play a role (Satiroglu et al ., 2002).  Most of 
the reported studies proved that algae species poss ess impressive sorption capacities for a 
range of dyes, however, little attention has been p aid to anthraquinone dye biosorption by 
algal biomass.  
 
5. ENZYMATIC DEGRADATION  
                          
The degradative ability of micro organisms has open ed up new prospects for the 
development of biotechnological processes aimed at the degradation of complex polymers 
such as xenobiotics for effluent decolorization. 
 
5.1 Fungal laccases 
 
The ability of fungi to rapidly adapt their metabol ism to varying carbon and nitrogen 
sources is an integrated aspect for their survival which is achieved through the production of 
a large set of intra and extracellular enzymes such  as lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese 
peroxidase (MnP) and laccase that are capable to de grade complex kinds of organic 
pollutants (Saratale et al., 2007) and thus appear to be the most appropriate in  the treatment 
of colored and metallic effluents (Ezeronye and Oke rentugba, 1999). Wong and Yu (1999) 
decolorized three synthetic dyes namely anthraquino ne, azo and indigo by the action of 
laccases produced from white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor,  which were not degraded by 
conventional treatment due to their unique and stab le chemical structures. Ashutosh Kumar 
Verma and Chandralata Raghukumar (2012) reported a rapid two-step technique for 
bioremediation of the anthraquinone dye, Reactive B lue 4 (RB4) which resulted in a decrease 
of 29% in total carbon accompanied by two-fold decr ease in toxicity from an initial dye 
concentration of 1000 mg L -1. This is the first report on decolorization, detox ification and 
mineralization of RB4 by laccase from a marine-deri ved fungus. Susla et al . (2007) have 
focused their study on the production of ligninolyt ic enzymes and dye degradation capacity 
of Dichomitus squalens  immobilized on polyurethane foam or pine wood PW i n a fixed bed 
reactor at a laboratory scale. According to them, i mmobilization of fungal cultures on pine 
wood improved laccase production eminently in compa rison to the liquid cultures and 
immobilized D. squalens  was able to decolorize the anthraquinone dye Remaz ol Brilliant 
Blue R and an azo dye Reactive Orange 16. Treatment  of dyes with this immobilized laccase 
reduced the toxicity of dyes up to 80% (anthraquino nic dyes).

 5.2 Bacterial laccases 
 
Compared to fungal laccases, bacteria-derived ones have some unique characteristics, 
such as activity and stability at high pH values (S harma et al . 2007), which make bacterial 
laccases alternatives for some special fields where  fungal laccases are inactive. Studies in 
recent years have suggested that laccases are wides pread in the bacterial kingdom (Alexandre 
and Zhulin 2000; Sharma et al.  2007), but only a few bacterial laccases have been  
characterized so far.  In a bacterial test system, Abadulla et al . (2000) found that the toxicity 
of several dyes, was reduced by laccase treatment, although there was no strict correlation 
between decolorization and detoxification. Engineer ed Pseudomonas putida  cells with a 
bacterial laccase (WlacD) were applied to decoloriz e the anthraquinone dye Acid Green (AG) 
25 and diazo-dye Acid Red (AR) 18 in and the result s showed that decolorization of both 
dyes are Cu 2+  and mediator-independent, with an optimum temperat ure of 35°C and pH of 
3.0. A high activity toward AG25 (1 g/l) with relat ive decolorization values of 91.2% (3 h) 
and 97.1% (18 h), as well as high activity to AR18 (1 g/l) was recorded. The engineered 
system exhibited a comparably high activity compare d with those of separate dyes (Wei 
Wang et al .,2012) .This study demonstrates, for the first tim e, the methodology by which the 
engineered P.putida  with surface-immobilized laccase was successfully used as regenerable 
biocatalyst for biodegrading synthetic dyes, thereb y opening new perspectives in the use of 
biocatalysts in industrial dye biotreatment. 
 
5.3 Peroxidase enzyme  
 
Peroxidase is a heme-containing enzyme that is wide ly distributed in plants, 
microorganisms and animals (Duarte-Vazquez et al ., 2003). These can catalyze 
degradation/transformation of aromatic dyes either by precipitation or by opening the 
aromatic ring structure. This degrading ability has  opened new prospects for the development 
of biotechnological processes aimed at the degradat ion of xenobiotic compounds(Field et al ., 
1993), effluent decolorization (Banat et al .,1996, Palma et al ., 1996) and biobleaching of 
Kraft pulp(Moreira et al.,  1997).  Concerted action of two peroxidases TcVP1,  versatile 
peroxidase (VP) and the dye-decolorizing peroxidase  (DyP) from T. cucumeris Dec 1  
resulted in complete decolorization of Reactive Blu e5(Yasushi Sugano et al ., 2006). This 
decolorization proceeded sequentially; DyP decolori zed Reactive blue 5 to light red-brown 
compounds, and then TcVP1 decolorized these colored  intermediates to colorless DyP. This 
is the first description of complete decolorization  of an anthraquinone dye in vitro, and the 
first report of using a dual-enzyme system for such  a purpose thus strongly supporting the 
notion that DyP and TcVP1 are good candidates for d evelopment as a novel strategy for the 
treatment of dye wastewater. From the bacterial kin gdom, a novel dye-decolorizing strain 
Serratia marcescens  efficiently decolorized two chemically different d yes; Ranocid Fast Blue 
and Procion Brilliant Blue-H-GR belonging to the az o and anthraquinone groups, 
respectively by the action of MnP(Verma and Madamwa r 2003). Thus, peroxidase based dye 
treatment will provide a reasonable basis for the d evelopment of biotechnological processes 
for continuous color and aromatic compounds removal  from various industrial effluents at 
large scale.

 6. CONCLUSION  
 
The degradation of dyes in textile industrial efflu ents presents an arduous task. 
Among the most economically viable choices for anth raquinone dye treatment, microbial 
systems suits to be the most practical in terms of manpower requirements and running 
expenses. Although decolorization is a challenging process to both the textile industry and the 
waste water treatment facilities, the literature su ggests a great potential for microbial 
treatment systems color removal with only hours of exposure. Dye decolorization may take 
place either by biosorption on the microbial biomas s or biodegradation by cells. In case of 
biosorption, the original structure of the dyes rem ains intact, and not degraded into fragments 
whereas in biodegradation, the original dye structu re is destroyed, and the pollutant is split 
into fragments by the microbial cells. Regarding th e various carbon sources used, two 
opinions have been argued for many years: one deems  that dyes are not a sole carbon source 
since the anaerobic bacteria obtain energy from the  glucose instead of the dyes and glucose 
inhibits the decolorizing activity while the other deems that glucose can enhance the 
decolorizing activity. The variability may be due t o the different microbial characteristics 
involved. Microorganisms capable of using the dye m olecules as a sole source of carbon, 
nitrogen, and energy are of special interest and si gnificance because they consume the dye for 
their growth and activities while at the same time eliminate the pollutant in a real sense. Their 
biodegradative potentials can be exploited to deal with the problem of synthetic dyes’ 
pollution and explore new horizons for further rese arch.
