Abstract. In the mammalian host, the unicellular 
flagellate Trypanosoma brucei is covered by a dense 
surface coat that consists of a single species of macro- 
molecule, the membrane form of the variant surface 
glycoprotein (mfVSG). After uptake by the insect vec- 
tor, the tsetse fly, bloodstream-form trypanosomes 
differentiate to procyclic forms in the fly midgut. 
Differentiation is characterized by the loss of the 
mfVSG coat and the acquisition of a new surface gly- 
coprotein, procyclin. In this study, the change in sur- 
face glycoprotein composition during differentiation 
was investigated in vitro. After triggering differentia- 
tion, a rapid increase in procyclin-specific mRNA was 
observed. In contrast, there was a lag of several hours before procyclin could be detected. Procyclin was in- 
corporated and uniformly distributed in the surface 
coat. The VSG coat was subsequently shed. For a sin- 
gle cell, it took 12-16 h to express a maximum level 
of procyclin at the surface while the loss of the VSG 
coat required ~4 h. The data are discussed in terms 
of the possible molecular arrangement of mfVSG and 
procyclin at the cell surface. Molecular modeling data 
suggest that a (Asp-Pro)2 (Glu-Pro)n_29 repeat in procy- 
clin assumes a cylindrical shape 14-18 nm in length 
and 0.9 nm in diameter. This extended shape would 
enable procyclin to interdigitate between the mfVSG 
molecules during differentiation, exposing epitopes be- 
yond the 12-15-nm-thick VSG coat. 
ONC the complex changes in gene expression and 
phenotype that accompany the differentiation of one 
cell type to another, alterations in the molecular 
composition of the cell surface are of particular interest be- 
cause surface molecules form the basis for communication 
between cells and their environment. Parasitic protozoa that 
alternate in their life cycle between a mammalian host and 
an insect vector are subject to particularly dramatic changes 
in envirdnment. It is therefore not unexpected that they re- 
spond with equally drastic changes in surface architecture. 
Indeed, African trypanosomes, exemplified here by Try- 
panosoma brucei, undergo extensive changes in surface com- 
position. The kinetics of expression and replacement of two 
different surface molecules, characteristic of two develop- 
mental stages, are the subject of this communication. 
In the mammal, bloodstream-form trypanosomes possess 
a 12-15-nm-thick coat that consists of '~107 molecules of 
1. Abbreviations used in this paper: FACS, fluorescence-activated cell 
sorter; mfVSG, membrane form of the variant surface glycoprotein; VSG, 
variant surface glycoprotein. the membrane form of the variant surface glycoprotein 
(mfVSG; Cross, 1975; Cardoso de Almeida and Turner, 
1983; Ferguson et al., 1988) and that covers the entire para- 
site surface (Vickerman and Luckins, 1969). The mfVSG is 
derived from a polypeptide precursor that is the product of 
a single gene. Through the sequential expression of a large 
repertoire of VSG genes, coding for antigenically distinct 
proteins, the trypanosome is able to evade the host immune 
response (for reviews see Donelson, 1987; Van der Ploeg, 
1987). The VSG serves a protective function by shielding un- 
derlying invariant membrane-embedded molecules. 
Trypanosomes ingested by the tsetse fly as part of a blood 
meal transform to procyclic forms over a 2-3-d period (Vick- 
erman, 1985). Transformation in vitro occurs with similar 
kinetics to transformation in vivo, giving rise to procyclic 
culture forms which, by several criteria, closely resemble 
those found in the insect midgut (Brown et al., 1973; Honig- 
berg et al., 1976; Richardson et al., 1986; Pearson et al., 
1987). During the transition from bloodstream to procyclic 
forms, VSG-specific mRNA and protein synthesis are re- 
pressed and the VSG is shed in a processed form into the 
medium (Overath et al., 1983; Ehlers et al., 1987; Billow et

The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 108, February 1989 737-746 737 
al., 1988). The arising procyclic forms expose common anti- 
gens on the surface membrane (Seed, 1964; Barry and Vick- 
erman, 1979). The only one of these antigens to have been 
characterized in any detail is an unusual glycoprotein that 
consists of a glutamic acid-proline dipeptide repeat for al- 
most half its length (Roditi et al., 1987; Mowatt and Clayton, 
1987; Richardson et al., 1988). This glycoprotein has re- 
cently been purified and named procyclin (Richardson et al., 
1988). T. brucei contains a family of related procyclin genes, 
several of which are expressed (Roditi et al., 1987; Mowatt 
and Clayton, 1987; Mowatt and Clayton, 1988). These genes 
are also referred to as procyclic acidic repetitive protein 
genes by Mowatt and Clayton (1987, 1988). In contrast to the 
VSG in bloodstream forms, procyclin is antigenically con- 
served in all isolates of T. brucei tested (Richardson et al., 
1986; Roditi et al., 1989). The function of procyclin still re- 
mains to be elucidated. 
We have studied procyclin gene expression and the loss of 
VSG during differentiation (also known as transformation) in 
vitro. It is concluded that procyclin is synthesized and incor- 
porated into the surface membrane before the VSG coat is 
lost. 
Materials and Methods 
Trypanosome Strains and Transformation Protocol 
Trypanosome variant MITat 1.4, cloned from T. brucei stock 427 (Cross, 
1975), was used throughout this study. The conditions used for the culture 
and transformation of trypanosomes in vitro are those described by Overath 
et al. (1986). In brief, bloodstream-form trypanosomes isolated from the 
blood of infected mice were grown at 37°C in trypanosome medium + 15 % 
heat-inactivated FBS from an initial density of 4 × 105/ml to a density of 
1.2-1.4 x 106/ml above a feeder layer of Microtus embryo fibroblasts. At 
time 0 h differentiation was initiated by the addition of citrate/cis-aconitate 
and a reduction in temperature to 270C. Within 24 h the parasite number 
increased to 2.6-3.7 x 106/ml; within 48 h a density of 4-5 × 106/ml was 
reached. 
RNA Isolation and Northern Blots 
Total RNA was isolated from "~10 s trypanosomes at each timepoint after 
the start of transformation. Trypanosomes were centrifuged at 800 g for 15 
min, the supernatant was discarded, and the trypanosomes were resus- 
pended in ,',,100 #1 medium that remained in the centrifuge tube. This sus- 
pension was added to a monophasic solution consisting of 500/~1 100 mM 
NaCI, 25 mM Tris-C1, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA (NTE buffer) containing 1% 
SDS and 500/~1 NTE-saturated phenol at 80°C and mixed gently for 3 min. 
After centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 g in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf 
centrifuges made by Brinkmann Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY), the 
aqueous phase was recovered and extracted with an equal volume of phenol 
saturated with NTE. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min, and the aque- 
ous phase collected and extracted with an equal volume of chloroform. Nu- 
cleic acid in the aqueous phase was recovered by ethanol precipitation fol- 
lowed by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min. RNA isolated in this way 
was free of detectable DNA. 
Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard procedures. 
Total RNA was treated with glyoxal and DMSO (McMaster and Carmi- 
chael, 1977) and separated on a 1.3% agarose gel followed by transfer to 
nitrocellulose. The following plasmids were used as hybridization probes: 
pPRO2001, a procyclin cDNA clone (Roditi et al., 1987), and pBS211, a 
cDNA clone of a gene expressed at equal levels in bloodstream- and 
procyclic-form trypanosomes. Probes were labeled with 32p by nick trans- 
lation using standard procedures (Rigby et al., 1977). 
Hybridization was quantitated by scanning densitometry of autoradio- 
graphs using an isodensitracer (model 3CS; Joyce Loebl, Gateshead, En- 
gland) and by liquid scintillation counting (Kontron Elektronik GmbH, 
Zurich) of nitrocellulose strips. For each timepoint, the value obtained with 
pPRO2001 was normalized against that obtained with pBS211 and expressed as a percentage of the measurement obtained for established procyclic 
forms. 
Antisera and mAbs 
Anti-VSG Antibodies. mAT127 is a mAb that recognizes an epitope of VSG 
MITat 1.4 on the surface of live bloodstream form trypanosomes. It was iso- 
lated from the culture supernatant of the respective hybridoma line by pro- 
tein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Monoclonal antibody mAT127 
was used for the immunofluorescence and flow cytometry experiments. Im- 
munoelectron microscopy was performed with a polyclonal rabbit antise- 
rum against the soluble form of VSG MITat 1.4. 
Antiprocyclin Antibodies. 10 mAbs of the IgG isotype, which recognize 
several surface epitopes of procyclin, have previously been described 
(Richardson et al., 1986; Liu and Pearson, 1987; Richardson et al., 1988). 
A cocktail containing all 10 mAbs was purified from pooled ascites fluid 
by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography and used for either im- 
munofluorescence, flow cytometry, or immunoelectron microscopy. 
PAGE 
SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions according to 
Laemmli (1970) using a mini-gel apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Rich- 
mond, CA). Proteins were stacked using a 3% gel and separated on a 10% 
gel at 10 mA. Prestained molecular weight markers (catalog No. 6041LA; 
Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) were run on each gel 
so that they could be seen on blotting membranes after electrophoretic 
transfer. 
Transfer of proteins from SDS-PAGE gels onto microporous membranes 
and subsequent detection of antigens were performed by the procedure of 
Towbin et al. (1979) extensively modified to reduce background binding of 
antibodies (Birk and Koepsell, 1987), to allow blotted proteins to renature 
(Bestagno et al., 1987), and to increase sensitivity by adding an additional 
antibody as a sandwich reagent. This method is described in detail else- 
where (Richardson et al., 1988), except that the membrane used was Im- 
mobilon (Millipore Continental Water Systems, Bedford, MA) and the as- 
cites fluids containing the control mAb (c~-urokinase) or the antiprocyclin 
mAb TBRP1/247 (Richardson et al., 1988) were used on the blots at a dilu- 
tion of 1:500 for 18 h at 4°C. In addition, a second antibody was included 
after the mAb TBRP1/247 and the antiurokinase mAb. This was a 1:5,000 
dilution of rabbit anti-mouse IgG serum for 3 h at room temperature. Detec- 
tion of this second antibody was performed by incubating the washed blots 
with 5.1 × 107 cpm of J25I-labeled horse anti-rabbit IgG F(ab)2. After 
washing and drying, the Immobilon sheets were exposed for autoradiogra- 
phy. Autoradiographs were developed after 9 d, cut into strips and scanned 
at 540 nm in a scanning spectrophotometer (DU; Beckman Instruments, 
Inc., Palo Alto, CA) fitted with a chart recorder (model 6051; Gilford, Ober- 
lin, OH). 
Determination of mfVSG 
Aliquots of trypanosomes in culture were chilled on ice, centrifuged, re- 
suspended in 1 ml cold trypanosome medium, and centrifuged again. After 
resuspension in 1 ml trypanosome medium, trypanosomes were counted, 
the sample was centrifuged again, and the pellet was stored at -20°C. Equal 
numbers of trypanosomes were processed for SDS-PAGE. After staining, 
proteins were quantified in a transmission densitometer (Pharmacia-LKB, 
Freiburg, FRG). The height of the VSG peak was corrected for colocalizing 
proteins by subtracting the absorbance given by a lysate of procyclic forms. 
lmmunofluorescence and Two-Color Flow Cytometry 
Fluorophore labeling of antibodies was performed as described by Goding 
(1983). Monoclonal antibody mAT127 (2.8 mg IgG) was labeled with 250 
/~g FITC in 3.5 ml sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, for 2 h at room tempera- 
ture. A mixture of 10 antiprocyclin mAbs (4.8 mg IgG) was labeled with 
360 ttg TRITC in 2 ml of this buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Labeled 
antibodies were separated from free fluorophore by gel exclusion chroma- 
tography on Sephadex G25 (Pharmacia-LKB). 
Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry were performed on fixed 
trypanosomes. 107 trypanosomes were pelleted by centrifugation and re- 
suspended in 0.5 ml PBS (137 mM NaCI, 2.7 mM KCI, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 
1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2). After addition of 0.5 ml 4% formaldehyde, 
0.1% glutaraldehyde, trypanosomes were stored for 12 h at 5°C. Trypano-

somes were washed in PBS/2% BSA, resuspended in this buffer, incubated 
for 1-2 h at 0°C with FITC-mAT127 and TRITC-antiprocyclin mAbs, and, 
finally, washed twice. 
The fluorescence of trypanosomes was examined in a Leitz Ortholux mi- 
croscope using an NPL FLUOTAR objective. For flow cytometry, trypano- 
somes were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) IV 
(Becton Dickinson & Co., Sunnyvale, CA). The green fluorescence of FITC 
was excited in a 5-W argon laser at 488 nm and emitted fluorescence was 
detected through a 525-nm band pass filter by an EM19524 photomultiplier. 
The red fluorescence of TRITC was excited with a 0.8-W krypton laser at 
568 nm and emitted fluorescence was detected through a 590-nm-long pass 
filter and a 610-nm band pass filter by a EMI 9798 photomultiplier. 
Immunoelectron Microscopy 
Preembedding labeling. 107 trypanosomes were centrifuged and resus- 
pended in 0.5 ml trypanosome medium + heat-inactivated FBS at 27°C. Af- 
ter addition of 50/zg antiprocyclin mAbs, the trypanosomes were incubated 
for 30 min at 27°C. After two washes with trypanosomes medium + heat- 
inactivated FBS at room temperature, the trypanosomes were resuspended 
in 0.5 ml PBS and fixed by addition of 0.5 ml 4% formaldehyde. The bound 
antibodies were detected with protein A-5-nm gold complexes prepared as 
described (Miihlpfordt, 1982; Slot and Geuze, 1985 a,b). Subsequently, 
the trypanosomes were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 1% tannic acid in 
0.1 M cacodylate, pH 6.9 (Simionescu and Simionescu, 1976), for 2 h at 
4°C, embedded in agarose, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M 
cacodylate, dehydrated with ethanol, and finally embedded in Epon. Ultra- 
thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined 
in an electron microscope (model 201; Philips Electronic Instruments, Inc., 
Mahwah, N J). 
On-Section Labeling. Trypanosomes were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 
0.05 % glutaraldehyde as described for immunofluorescence. After embed- 
ding the trypanosomes in agarose, the samples were dehydrated with ethanol 
at progressively lower temperature and embedded in Lowicryl HM20 at 
-35°C (Carlemalm et al., 1982). Ultrathin sections were treated with 0.5 % 
BSA, 0.2 % gelatin in PBS to block nonspecific binding sites, incubated with 
antiprocyclin mAbs or rabbit anti-VSG antiserum and protein A-15-nm gold 
complexes. The labeled sections were stained and screened as described 
above. Molecular Dynamics Calculation of Protein Structure 
Molecular dynamics calculations were carried out using the GROMOS pro- 
gram (Van Gunsteren and Karplus, 1982; Van Gunsteren et al., 1983) with 
the bond lengths constrained by the SHAKE algorithm (Ryckaert et al., 
1977) and a cut-off for nonbonded interactions at 1 nm. After energy mini- 
mization of the initial conformations, molecular dynamics simulations (time 
step 2 fs) were performed with coupling to a heat bath at 300 K (Berendsen 
et al., 1984). Two time constants, 10 and 100 fs, were used to simulate tight 
and loose coupling, respectively, because tight coupling increases the transi- 
tion rate between two conformations whereas loose coupling allows a realistic 
description of the equilibrium dynamics (Van Gunsteren et al., 1983; Berend- 
sen et al., 1984). The simulations were performed on a Microvax II and 
the graphics on a PS390 with the graphics program SYBYL/MENDYL 
(Evans & Sutherland, Salt Lake City, UT). 
Results 
Expression of Procyclin and Loss of VSG 
during Transformation 
To investigate the kinetics of induction of procyclin gene ex- 
pression, RNA was isolated from trypanosomes at various 
times after triggering differentiation, and also from blood- 
stream forms and established procyclic culture forms of the 
same variant. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1) was performed 
using a full-length cDNA clone of procyclin (pPRO2001) as 
a probe. A second cDNA clone (pBS211) that is not differen- 
tially expressed in bloodstream- and procyclic-form trypano- 
somes was included as a control probe. Although there was 
some variation between individual experiments, procyclin 
transcripts were clearly visible 2 h after the start of transfor- 
mation. The relative amount of procyclin mRNA initially in- 
creased linearly with time, reaching the level observed in es- 
tablished procyclic forms within 18-24 h (Fig. 2). RNA 
isolated from bloodstream forms, either directly or after 
growth in culture overnight at 37°C, showed little or no de- 
tectable procyclin mRNA. 
The total amount of procyclin present in trypanosomes at 
various times after the onset of transformation was assayed 
by immunoblot analysis using a mAb that recognizes the 
dipeptide repeat of procyclin (Richardson et al., 1988). In 
contrast to the mRNA, which can be detected within 2 h, the

bloodstream-form trypanosomes (B), procyclic forms (P), and 
from trypanosomes 0 to 72 h after the start of transformation was 
separated on a 1.3 % agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. 
The blot was probed with a mixture of 32P-labeled plasmids 
pPRO2001 and pBS211. In the autoradiograph, pBS211 detects a 
transcript expressed in equal amounts in bloodstream- and in pro- 
cyclic-form trypanosomes, and serves as a reference for quantita- 
tion of the procyclin mRNA detected by pPRO2001. 120 /-:-.

fluorochrome was eliminated from the panels. 
This area could also contain debris from the feeder 
cells. (b) Two-dimensional diagrams of represen-

to represent 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 .... cells, respec- 
tively. Areas designated A to C in the bloodstream- 
form panel refer to populations of VSG+procyclin -, 
VSG÷procyclin +, and VSG-procyclin + trypano- 
somes, respectively. 
procyclin protein was first detectable after 8 h, reaching max- 
imum levels within 24 h (Fig. 2). 
The amount of cell-associated mfVSG at different times 
during transformation was estimated by SDS-PAGE. Mem- 
brane-form VSG was slowly lost during the initial 12-16 h 
after the start of transformation and then became undetect- 
able within the next 32-36 h (Fig. 2). Comparison of the 
timecourse of procyclin synthesis and VSG loss indicated 
that the rise in the level of procyclin occurred when most of 
the VSG was still cell associated. 
Surface Expression of Procyclin and VSG Analyzed by 
Two-Color Flow Cytometry 
So far, the above biochemical and immunochemical analysis 
provides information on the average level of procyclin and VSG in the trypanosome population as a function of time. 
The kinetics shown in Fig. 2 depend on two parameters: (a) 
the rate at which a trypanosome can synthesize procyclin and 
release VSG; and (b) the fraction of the population contribut- 
ing to the overall change in antigen composition at any given 
time. These parameters can be separated by studying the dis- 
tribution of the two surface glycoproteins by flow cytometry. 
Trypanosomes were labeled simultaneously with an FITC- 
conjugated anti-VSG mAb and a TRITC-conjugated antipro- 
cyclin mAb mixture and analyzed by FACS. The two-dimen- 
sional FACS analysis is depicted in Fig. 3 and quantitated in 
Fig. 4. Initially, the trypanosomes were only labeled with the 
anti-VSG mAb (Fig. 3, panels for bloodstream forms and 
0 h). During the subsequent 8 h after the initiation of trans- 
formation, this situation was unchanged. By 12 h, ~8% of 
the population had acquired procyclin at the surface (Figs.

3 and 4) without a detectable change in the labeling intensity 
of the VSG coat. By 16 h, '~20% of the trypanosomes be- 
came positive for both antigens; some of these showed a 
TRITC-fluorescence intensity comparable to that of estab- lished procyclic forms. Also, between 12 and 16 h, a signif- 
icant number of trypanosomes devoid of VSG appeared. The 
remaining panels demonstrate the further progression of the 
population from a VSG+procyclin - state via an intermediate 
VSG+procyclin + state to the VSG-procyclin ÷ state. Finally, a 
small fraction of the population retained the VSG+procyclin - 
phenotype and the morphology of bloodstream forms when 
most trypanosomes had transformed (Fig. 3, 48 h). By inte- 
grating the three cell populations for each sample the curves 
depicted in Fig. 4 were obtained. 
It is clear from Figs. 3 and 4 that the trypanosomes do not 
transform in synchrony. While some trypanosomes are readily 
transformed, others lag behind by 24-30 h and some do not 
transform at all. A fraction of the trypanosomes expressed 
procyclin at the surface 8-12 h after the start of differentiation 
in agreement with the time procyclin first became detectable 
by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). After 16 h, these trypanosomes 
showed a TRITC-fluorescence intensity comparable to that 
of mature procyclic forms, suggesting that it took 12-16 h 
for a single organism to express a high level of procyclin at 
the surface. The fraction of VSG+procyclin ÷ intermediates 
reached a maximum of 40 % of the population at 24 h. The 
observation that a significant fraction of VSG-procyclin ÷ 
trypanosomes appeared between 12 and 16 h suggests that 
a trypanosome can release its VSG coat in a time as short 
as 4 h. There is also good agreement between the time re- 
quired to release half the total VSG in the population (Fig. 
2, 25 h) and the decrease in the number of VSG ÷ trypano-

somes to half the initial value (25.7 + 2.5 h by FACS and 
26 h by fluorescence microscopy). These results indicate 
that the appearance of procyclin on the cell surface precedes 
the loss of the VSG coat. 
Localization of Procyclin and VSG by 
Electron Microscopy 
The synthesis of procyclin and the release of VSG in differen- 
tiating trypanosomes were studied at the ultrastructural level 
by immunoelectron microscopy. Trypanosomes harvested 
12 h after triggering transformation were embedded in Lowi- 
cryl HM20 and the sections labeled with anti-VSG antibod- 
ies (Fig. 5 a) or antiprocyclin mAbs (Fig. 5 b) and protein 
A-gold. As expected from the flow cytometric experiments 
(Figs. 3 and 4), the majority of trypanosomes at 12 h could 
be labeled with anti-VSG antibodies, mainly at the surface 
(Fig. 5 a), and only the occasional trypanosome remained 
devoid of label. In contrast, a few trypanosomes labeled with 
antiprocyclin mAbs while all others did not bind these anti- 
bodies (Fig. 5 b). In common with the VSG, procyclin was 
mainly located and uniformly distributed in the plasma mem- 
brane; no sections were observed that were labeled only in 
intracellular structures and not at the plasma membrane. The 
uniform distribution of procyclin over the entire body of the 
trypanosomes was also evident from microscopic inspection 
of double-fluorescent trypanosomes labeled simultaneously 
with TRITC-antiprocyclin and FITC-anti-VSG mAbs (data 
not shown). 
The coexistence of VSG and procyclin at the cell surface 
could be demonstrated by a preembedding labeling experi- 
ment. Trypanosomes were first labeled with antiprocyclin 
mAbs in medium at 2"/°C. After washing and fixation, bound 
antibodies were tagged with protein A-gold and the surface 
coat was stained with tannic acid. Representative sections of 
trypanosomes obtained by this labeling protocol are shown 
in Fig. 6. Bloodstream forms (Fig. 6 a) were surrounded by 
a distinct coat, a uniformly stained, 12-15 nm-thick layer ad- 
jacent to the plasma membrane. After 48 h (Fig. 6 c), the 
surface architecture had changed considerably. Tannic acid 
staining revealed a light halo, 8-10 nm wide, separating a 
layer of moderately densely staining material from the mem- 
brane. This outer layer was heavily labeled with protein 
A-gold. The micrograph of Fig. 6 b allows direct compari- 
son of these two forms. In Fig. 7, these two forms (a and d) 
are compared to two intermediates. Significantly, the 12-h 
sample contained a considerable proportion of trypanosomes 
that labeled with protein A-gold and at the same time showed 
an apparently intact VSG coat (Fig. 7 b). In addition, 
procyclin + trypanosomes could be detected in which the 
VSG coat had a fuzzy or gapped appearance (Fig. 7 c) sug- 
gesting that these cells were in the process of VSG release. 
Figure 7. Electron micrograph of trypanosomes labeled 12 h after 
triggering transformation. Preembedding labeling with antiprocy- 
clin mAbs and protein A-5-nm gold and staining of the surface coat 
with tannic acid were performed as for Fig. 6. Sections were ob- 
tained showing an intact VSG coat and no procyclin (a), both VSG 
and procyclin (b and c) or procyclin, but no detectable VSG coat 
(d). In part e, mAbs were omitted.

Finally, a control preparation in which the trypanosomes 
were not incubated with antiprocyclin antibodies was com- 
pletely devoid of protein A-gold particles (Fig. 7 e). 
Molecular Modeling of the Dipeptide Repeat 
of Procyclin 
The structure of the glutamic acid-proline repeat in procyclin 
was investigated by molecular dynamics techniques. Simula- 
tions were performed for 400 ps with the model peptide 
Pro~-Glu-Pro-Glu-Pro~. Two different initial conformations 
with all trans peptide bonds, a-helical (~ = -57% ~b = -47°; 
rise per residue, 0.15 nm) or extended 6P = ~b = 180°; rise 
per residue, 0.36 nm), were assumed, neither of them con- 
taining net charges. The extended structure quickly con- 
tracted to a structure with a rise per residue of 0.29 nm with 
the central dihedral angles ,p~3 = -42 °, tk~o3 = 118 °, ~O~u = 
-103 °, ~ba,u = 123% values averaged over 40 ps. This struc- 
ture was stable under all coupling conditions. The a-helical 
conformation simulated under loose coupling conditions 
stretched to a rise per residue of 0.25 nm and eventually con- 
verged to the same structure as the extended conformation 
under tight coupling. Thus, an identical structure with a rise 
per residue of 0.29 nm was obtained starting from either the 
extended or a-helical conformation. An (Asp-Pro)2(Glu- 
Pro)29 repeat was modeled using the dihedral angles of the 
peptide given above. The resulting structure is a cylinder 
18 nm in length and 0.9 nm in diameter (Fig. 8). 
Discussion 
Kinetics of Procyclin Synthesis and VSG Coat Release 
Differentiation from bloodstream forms to procyclic forms in 
vitro is initiated by subjecting a culture of exponentially 
growing bloodstream forms to a decrease in temperature in 
the presence of citric acid cycle intermediates• The data from 
the FACS analysis clearly shows that transformation is not 
synchronous in these cultures. One possibility is that try- 
panosomes are only capable of responding to differentiation 
signals at a certain phase of the cell cycle and that a fraction 
of the population might take a considerable time to reach this 
phase. If this were the case, the observed lack of synchrony 
would be largely caused by variability in the timepoint of ini- 
tiation rather than variability in the time required for com- 
pleting transformation after triggering. 
The results presented here show that procyclin mRNA syn- 
thesis is rapidly induced in trypanosomes differentiating 
from bloodstream to procyclic forms and precedes any obvi- 
ous morphological changes. Interestingly, there is a lag of 
several hours between the detection of procyclin mRNA and 
detection of the protein by immunoblotting, FACS analysis, 
or immunoelectron microscopy, suggesting posttranscrip- 
tional control. It is possible that an additional signal is re- 
quired in order for translation of procyclin mRNA to occur. 
Posttranscriptional control has also been observed in other 
developmentally regulated genes in lower eukaryotes includ- 
ing the tubulin genes of Leishmania mexicana (Wallach et 
al., 1982) and the cysteine proteinase 2 gene of Dictyostelium 
discoideum (Pears and Williams, 1987). 
FACS analysis shows that an individual trypanosome takes 
at least 12 h to express maximum surface levels of procyclin 0.91 n m

peptide, derived by molecular dynamics simu- 
lation. 
(Fig. 3 b). As judged by fluorescence intensity, this can occur 
in the presence of the full complement of VSG. Immunoelec- 
tron microscopy (Fig. 7) also shows that procyclin can be 
found on trypanosomes where tannic acid staining reveals an 
essentially intact VSG coat. A lag in the onset of VSG release 
might be beneficial for survival. It has previously been 
demonstrated that bloodstream forms are resistant to lysis by 
host serum components whereas procyclic forms or blood- 
stream forms whose VSG coat has been digested with trypsin 
are susceptible to complement-mediated lysis by the alterna- 
tive pathway (for review see Vickerman, 1985). If comple- 
ment were to remain active for any length of time in the tsetse 
fly midgut, it could be detrimental for trypanosomes to shed 
the VSG coat too rapidly. If, in addition, procyclin is neces- 
sary for survival in the fly, parasites simultaneously express- 
ing both VSG and procyclin on the surface could be at a 
selective advantage during differentiation. 
It has recently been shown that VSG release mainly leads 
to its appearance as an NH2-terminal fragment in the cul- 
ture supernatant (Billow et al., 1989). The time at which this 
fragment is detected correlates with the first appearance of 
VSG- trypanosomes as determined by FACS analysis. That 
VSG release can occur in as little as 4 h for an individual 
trypanosome implies an active process with the NH2- 
terminal fragment as the end-product. 
Structure of Procyclin and Its Arrangement 
in the VSG Coat 
Procyclin is expressed in at least two closely related versions 
(Roditi et al., 1987; Mowatt and Clayton, 1987; Richardson 
et al., 1988; Mowatt and Clayton, 1988). These consist of a 
31-amino acid NH2-terminal domain, containing a glycosyla- 
tion site, followed by the sequence (Asp-Pro)ffGlu-Pro)22-29 
and a 23-amino acid hydophobic tail. At present it is not 
known how procyclin is attached to the cell membrane. While 
the COOH-terminal sequence is a candidate for glypiation

Figure 9. Model for coexpression of VSG and 
procyclin on the surface of differentiating 
trypanosomes. The model for mfVSG is taken 
from Jiihnig et al. (1987). The membrane an- 
chor of procyclin is represented schematically 
as its structure is unknown. 
(Ferguson and Williams, 1988), it is also possible that it forms 
an a-helix which anchors the protein in the membrane. 
It has previously been determined by nuclear magnetic res- 
onance that glutamic acid-proline dipeptide repeats have an 
extended rodlike structure (Evans et al., 1986). We have used 
molecular modeling techniques to predict the dimensions of 
the dipeptide repeat in procyclin. Interestingly, the two 
different initial conformations that were assumed, a-helical 
and extended, converged to a single structure with a rise per 
residue of 0.29 nm. The resulting structure of the peptide 
(Asp-Pro)ffGlu-Pro)22-29 is a cylinder 14-18 nm in length 
and 0.9 nm in diameter. This finding, which is in good agree- 
ment with the estimates of interproton distances and dihedral 
angles measured by Evans et al. (1986), suggests that the 
repetitive region confers a highly extended structure upon 
procyclin. It is known that VSG molecules have an elongated 
structure dominated by two 8-nm-long helices in the NH2- 
terminal domain (Freymann et al., 1984; Metcalf et al., 1987) that is connected via the COOH-terminal domain to 
the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor (Fergu- 
son et al., 1985; Schmitz et al., 1987; Ferguson et al., 1988). 
The length of the NH2-terminal domain is ,,o10 nm, which 
is consistent with the 12-15-nm-thick coat observed by elec- 
tron microscopy (Vickerman and Luckins, 1969). On the ba- 
sis of these two structures, a hypothetical arrangement of 
mfVSG and procyclin on the surface of differentiating try- 
panosomes is proposed (Fig. 9) in which the procyclin repeat 
region interdigitates between and extends beyond the VSG 
molecules.
