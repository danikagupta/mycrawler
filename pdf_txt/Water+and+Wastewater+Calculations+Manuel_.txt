This manual presents the basic principles and concepts rela ting to
water/wastewater engineering and provides illustrative exampl es of
the subject covered. To the extent possible, examples rely on prac tical
field data and regulatory requirements have been integrated int o the
environmental design process. Each of the calculations provided  herein
is solved step-by-step in a streamlined manner that is intend ed to facil-
itate understanding. Examples (step-by-step solutions) range from  cal-
culations commonly used by operators to more complicated calcul ations
required for research or design. For calculations provided herein using
the US customary units, readers who use the International Sy stem may
apply the conversion factors listed in Appendix E. Answers a re also gen-
erally given in SI units for most of problems solved by the US custom-
ary units. 
This book has been written for use by the following readers: studen ts
taking coursework relating to “Public Water Supply,” “Wast e-Water
Engineering,” or “Stream Sanitation”; practicing environmen tal (sani-
tary) engineers; regulatory officers responsible for the review and
approval of engineering project proposals; operators, engineers, an d
managers of water and/or wastewater treatment plants; and oth er pro-
fessionals, such as chemists and biologists, who need some know ledge
of water/wastewater issues. This work will benefit all operators and
managers of public water supply and of wastewater treatment p lants,
environmental design engineers, military environmental engineers ,
undergraduate and graduate students, regulatory officers, loca l public
works engineers, lake managers, and environmentalists.
Advances and improvements in many fields are driven by compet ition
or the need for increased profits. It may be fair to say, however, that
advances and improvements in environmental engineering are dri ven
instead by regulation. The US Environmental Protection Agency (U S EPA)
sets up maximum contaminant levels, which research and pr oject
designs must reach as a goal. The step-by-step solution examples  pro-
vided in this book are guided by the integration of rules and regulations

extensive survey of literature on surface water and groundwater p er-
taining to environmental engineering and compiled them in thi s book.
Rules and regulations are described as simply as possible, and practical
examples are given.
The text includes calculations for surface water, groundwater, drink-
ing water treatment, and wastewater engineering. Chapter 1 c omprises
calculations for river and stream waters. Stream sanitation  had been
studied for nearly 100 years. By mid-twentieth century, theoret ical and
empirical models for assessing waste-assimilating capacity of streams
were well developed.  Dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen deman d
in streams and rivers have been comprehensively illustrated i n this
book. Apportionment of stream users and pragmatic approaches for
stream dissolved oxygen models also first appeared in this man ual.
From the 1950s through the 1980s, researchers focused extensively  on
wastewater treatment. In the 1970s, rotating biological cont actors
became a hot subject. Design criteria and examples for all of t hese are
included in this volume. Some treatment and management technol ogies
are no longer suitable in the United States. However, they are st ill of
some use in developing countries.
Chapter 2 is a compilation of adopted methods and documented
research. In the early 1980s, the US EPA published Guidelin es for
Diagnostic and Feasibility Study of Public Owned Lakes (Clean Lakes
Program, or CLP). This was intended to be as a guideline for lake m an-
agement. CLP and its calculation (evaluation) methods are present ed
for the first time in this volume. Hydrological, nutrient, and  sediment
budgets are presented for reservoir and lake waters. Techniques for
classification of lake water quality and assessment of the lak e trophic
state index and lake use support are also presented.  
Calculations for groundwater are given in Chapter 3. They inc lude
groundwater hydrology, flow in aquifers, pumping and its in fluence zone,
setback zone, and soil remediation. Well setback zone is regulated  by the
state EPA. Determinations of setback zones are also included in the
book. Well function for confined aquifers is presented in Appendix B.
Hydraulics for environmental engineering is included in Chapt er 4.
This chapter covers fluid (water) properties and definitions, hyd rostat-
ics, fundamental concepts of water flow in pipes, weirs, orifices , and in
open channels, and flow measurements. Pipe networks for water supp ly
distribution systems and hydraulics for water and wastewa ter treatment
plants are also included.
Chapters 5 and 6 cover the unit process for drinking water a nd waste-
water treatment, respectively. The US EPA developed design criteri a and
guidelines for almost all unit processes. These two chapters depi ct the
integration of regulations (or standards) into water and wastew aterx Prefacedesign procedures. Drinking water regulations and membrane fi ltration
are updated in Chapter 5. In addition, three new sections on pellet soft-
ening, disinfection by-products (DBP), and health risks, also are incor-
porated in Chapter 5. The DBP section provides concise information  for
drinking water professionals. Although the pellet softening proc ess is
not accepted in the United States, it has been successfully u sed in many
other countries. It is believed that this is the first present ation of pellet
softening in US  environmental engineering books. Another new sect ion
of constructed wetlands is included in Chapter 6. These two ch apters
(5 and 6) are the heart of the book and provide the theoretical con sid-
erations of unit processes, traditional (or empirical) design con cepts, and
integrated regulatory requirements. Drinking water quality standards,
wastewater effluent standards, and several new examples have al so
been added. 
The current edition corrects certain computational, typographi cal,
and grammatical errors found in the previous edition. 
Charles C. C. Lee initiated the project of Handbook of Environmental
Engineering Calculations. Gita Raman of ITC (India) did excellent
editing of the final draft. The author also wishes to acknowledge Meiling

1 General
This chapter presents calculations on stream sanitation. The main por-
tion covers the evaluation of water assimilative capacities of r ivers or
streams. The procedures include classical conceptual approach es and
pragmatic approaches: the conceptual approaches use simulat ion mod-
els, whereas Butts and his coworkers (1973, 1974, 1981) of th e Illinois
State Water Survey use a pragmatic approach. Observed diss olved oxy-
gen (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels are measured
at several sampling points along a stream reach. Both appr oaches are
useful for developing or approving the design of wastewater treatmen t
facilities that discharge into a stream.
In addition, biological factors such as algae, indicator b acteria, diver-
sity index, and macroinvertebrate biotic index are also presen ted.
2 Point Source Dilution
Point source pollutants are commonly regulated by a determinist ic
model for an assumed design condition having a specific probab ility
of occurrence. A simplistic dilution and/or balance equation c an be
written as

where Cd/H11005completely mixed constituent concentration downstream
of the effluent, mg/L
Qu/H11005stream flow upstream of the effluent, cubic feet per
second, cfs
Cu/H11005 constituent concentration of upstream flow, mg/L
Qe/H11005flow of the effluent, cfs
Ce/H11005constituent concentration of the effluent, mg/LCd5QuCu1QeCe
Qu1Qe2 Chapter 1Under the worst case, a 7-day, 10-year low flow is generally us ed for
stream flow condition, for design purposes.
Example: A power plant pumps 27 cfs from a stream, with a flow of 186 c fs.
The discharge of the plant’s ash-pond is 26 cfs. The boron concent rations for
upstream water and the effluent are 0.051 and 8.9 mg/L, respec tively.
Compute the boron concentration in the stream after completely mix ing.
solution: By Eq. (1.1)
3 Discharge Measurement
Discharge (flow rate) measurement is very important to provide th e
basic data required for river or stream water quality. The tot al dis-
charge for a stream can be estimated by float method with wind  and
other surface effects, by die study, or by actual subsection flow  meas-
urement, depending on cost, time, manpower, local conditions, et c. The
discharge in a stream cross section can be measured from a su bsection
by the following formula:

Table 1.1. The flow rate is 1559 cfs.
4 Time of Travel
The time of travel can be determined by dye study or by computat ion.

Q31
86,400Streams and Rivers 5liter (mg/L) is a measurement of the amount of oxygen dissolved in w ater.
It can be determined with a DO meter or by a chemical titra tion method.
The DO in water has an important impact on aquatic anima ls and
plants. Most aquatic animals, such as fish, require oxyg en in the water
to survive. The two major sources of oxygen in water are from diffusi on
from the atmosphere across the water surface and the photosyntheti c
oxygen production from aquatic plants such as algae and ma crophytes.
Important factors that affect DO in water (Fig. 1.1) may incl ude water
temperature, aquatic plant photosynthetic activity, wind and wave mix-
ing, organic contents of the water, and sediment oxygen demand.
Excessive growth of algae (bloom) or other aquatic plants may pr ovide
very high concentration of DO, so called supersaturation. On the other
hand, oxygen deficiencies can occur when plant respiration dep letes
oxygen beyond the atmospheric diffusion rate. This can occur espec ially
during the winter ice cover period and when intense decomposition  of
organic matter in the lake bottom sediment occurs during the summer.
These oxygen deficiencies will result in fish being killed.6 Chapter 1
Figure 1.1 Factors affecting dissolved oxygen concentration in
water.5.1 Dissolved oxygen saturation
DO saturation (DOsat) values for various water temperatures can be com-
puted using the American Society of Civil Engineers’ formula (Am erican
Society of Civil Engineering Committee on Sanitary Engineering
Research, 1960):
DOsat/H1100514.652 /H110020.41022 T/H110010.0079910 T2/H110020.000077774 T3(1.4)
where DOsat/H11005dissolved oxygen saturation concentration, mg/L
T/H11005water temperature, /H11034C
This formula represents saturation values for distilled water ( b/H110051.0)
at sea level pressure. Water impurities can increase the satu ration level
(b/H110221.0) or decrease the saturation level ( b/H110211.0), depending on the
surfactant characteristics of the contaminant. For most cases , bis
assumed to be unity. The DOsatvalues calculated from the above formula
are listed in Table 1.2 (example: DOsat/H110058.79 mg/L, when T/H1100521.3 /H11034C)
for water temperatures ranging from zero to 30 /H11034C (American Society of
Engineering Committee on Sanitary Engineering Research, 1960).
Example 1: Calculate DO saturation concentration for a water temperature
at 0, 10, 20, and 30 /H11034C, assuming b/H110051.0.

5.2 Dissolved oxygen availability
Most regulatory agencies have standards for minimum DO concen tra-
tions in surface waters to support indigenous fish species in surface
waters. In Illinois, for example, the Illinois Pollution Control  Board stip-
ulate that dissolved oxygen shall not be less than 6.0 mg/L during at least
16 h of any 24-h period, nor less than 5.0 mg/L at any time (IEPA, 1999).
The availability of dissolved oxygen in a flowing stream is hi ghly vari-
able due to several factors. Daily and seasonal variations in  DO levels
have been reported. The diurnal variations in DO are primaril y induced
by algal productivity. Seasonal variations are attributa ble to changes in
temperature that affect DO saturation values. The ability of a stream
to absorb or reabsorb oxygen from the atmosphere is affected by flow fa c-
tors such as water depth and turbulence, and it is express ed in terms
of the reaeration coefficient. Factors that may represent significan t
sources of oxygen use or oxygen depletion are biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD) and sediment oxygen demand (SOD). BOD, including
carbonaceous BOD (CBOD) and nitrogenous BOD (NBOD), may be the
product of both naturally occurring oxygen use in the decomposi tion of
organic material and oxygen depletion in the stabilization of effl uents
discharged from wastewater treatment plants (WTPs). The significan ce
of any of these factors depends upon the specific stream conditions.  One
or all of these factors may be considered in the evaluation of oxygen  use
and availability. 50.977 52116.8247.8

2116.8Streams and Rivers 96 Biochemical Oxygen Demand Analysis
Laboratory analysis for organic matter in water and wastewat er
includes testing for biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen
demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), and total oxygen deman d
(TOD). The BOD test is a biochemical test involving the use of mi cro-
organisms. The COD test is a chemical test. The TOC and TOD t ests are
instrumental tests.
The BOD determination is an empirical test that is widely u sed for
measuring waste (loading to and from wastewater treatment plan ts),
evaluating the organic removal efficiency of treatment processes, a nd
assessing stream assimilative capacity. The BOD test measu res: (1) the
molecular oxygen consumed during a specific incubation period for the
biochemical degradation of organic matter (CBOD); (2) oxygen used to
oxidize inorganic material such as sulfide and ferrous iron; a nd (3)
reduced forms of nitrogen (NBOD) with an inhibitor (trichloromethy lpyri-
dine). If an inhibiting chemical is not used, the oxygen dema nd measured
is the sum of carbonaceous and nitrogenous demands, so-called tot al
BOD or ultimate BOD.
The extent of oxidation of nitrogenous compounds during the 5-day
incubation period depends upon the type and concentration of mic ro-
organisms that carry out biooxidation. The nitrifying bacter ia usually
are not present in raw or settleable primary sewage. These nitri fying
organisms are present in sufficient numbers in biological (secon dary)
effluent. A secondary effluent can be used as “seeding” material for an
NBOD test of other samples. Inhibition of nitrification is requ ired for a
CBOD test for secondary effluent samples, for samples seeded with s ec-
ondary effluent, and for samples of polluted waters.
The result of the 5-day BOD test is recorded as carbonaceous bio-
chemical oxygen demand, CBOD5, when inhibiting nitrogenous oxygen
demand. When nitrification is not inhibited, the result is r eported as
BOD5(incubation at 15 /H11034C for 5 days).
The BOD test procedures can be found in Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA, AWWA, and WEF, 1995).
When the dilution water is seeded, oxygen uptake (consumed) is
assumed to be the same as the uptake in the seeded blank. The di ffer-
ence between the sample BOD and the blank BOD, corrected for the
amount of seed used in the sample, is the true BOD. Formulas for cal-
culation of BOD are as follows (APHA, AWWA, and WEF, 1995):

Example 1: For a BOD test, 75 mL of a river water sample is used in the
300 mL of BOD bottles without seeding with three duplications.  The initial
DO in three BOD bottles read 8.86, 8.88, and 8.83 mg/ L, respectively. The
DO levels after 5 days at 20 /H11034C incubation are 5.49, 5.65, and 5.53 mg/L,
respectively. Find the 5-day BOD (BOD5) for the river water.

7 Streeter–Phelps Oxygen Sag Formula
The method most widely used for assessing the oxygen resources in
streams and rivers subjected to effluent discharges is the Str eeter–Phelps
oxygen sag formula that was developed for the use on the Ohio River  in
1914. The well-known formula is defined as follows (Streeter and
Phelps, 1925):

or
(1.8b)

K2/H11005reoxygenation coefficient to the base e, per day
k1/H11005deoxygenation coefficient to the base 10, per day
k2/H11005reoxygenation coefficient to the base 10, per day
In the early days, K1or K2and k1or k2were used classically for values
based on eand 10, respectively. Unfortunately, in recent years, many
authors have mixed the usage of Kand k. Readers should be aware of
this. The logarithmic relationships between kand Kare K1/H110052.3026 k1
and K2/H110052.3026 k2; or k1/H110050.4343 K1and k2/H110050.4343 K2.
The Streeter–Phelps oxygen sag equation is based on two assump-
tions: (1) at any instant, the deoxygenation rate is directly  proportional
to the amount of oxidizable organic material present; and (2) the reoxy-
genation rate is directly proportional to the DO deficit. Math ematical
expressions for assumptions (1) and (2) are

La/H11005ultimate upstream BOD, mg/L
Lt/H11005ultimate downstream BOD at any time t, mg/L
Combining the above two differential equations and integrating between
the limits Da, the initial upstream sampling point, and t, any time of flow
below the initial point, yields the basic equation devised by  Streeter and
Phelps. This stimulated intensive research on BOD, reaction ra tes, and
stream sanitation.
There are some shortcomings in the Streeter–Phelps equation. The two
assumptions are likely to generate errors. It is assumed that : (1) wastes
discharged to a receiving water are evenly distributed over th e river’s
cross section; and (2) the wastes travel down the river as a p lug flow with-
out mixing along the axis of the river. These assumptions only apply
within a reasonable distance downstream. Effluent discharge g enerally
travels as a plume for some distance before mixing. In addition , it is
assumed that oxygen is removed by microbial oxidation of the org anic
matter (BOD) and is replaced by reaeration from the surface. Some fac-
tors, such as the removal of BOD by sedimentation, conversion of sus-
pended BOD to soluble BOD, sediment oxygen demand, and algal
photosynthesis and respiration are not included.
The formula is a classic in sanitary engineering stream work . Its
detailed analyses can be found in almost all general environmen tal engi-
neering texts. Many modifications and adaptations of the basi c equation
have been devised and have been reported in the literature. Many
researches have been carried out on BOD, K1, and K2factors. Illustrations
for oxygen sag formulas will be presented in the latter sections.
8 BOD Models and K1Computation
Under aerobic conditions, organic matter and some inorganics can be
used by bacteria to create new cells, energy, carbon dioxide, a nd residue.
The oxygen used to oxidize total organic material and all forms of nitro-
gen for 60 to 90 days is called the ultimate BOD (UBOD). It is common
that measurements of oxygen consumed in a 5-day test period call eddD

in Fig. 1.2.
8.1 First-order reaction
Phelps law states that the rate of biochemical oxidation of organ ic mat-
ter is proportional to the remaining concentration of unoxidized s ub-
stance. Phelps law can be expressed in differential form as follows

or

For the Upper Illinois Waterway study, many of the total and NBOD
curves have an S-shaped configuration. The BOD in waters from p ools
often consists primarily of high-profile second-stage or NBOD, and
the onset of the exertion of this NBOD is often delayed 1 or 2 days . The
delayed NBOD and the total BOD (TBOD) curves, dominated by th e
NBOD fraction, often exhibit an S-shaped configuration. The genera l
mathematical formula used to simulate the S-shaped curve is (B utts
et al., 1975)
(1.15)
where mis a power factor, and the other terms are as previously defined.
Statistical results show that a power factor of 2.0 in Eq. (1.15) best
represents the S-shaped BOD curve generated in the Lockport and
Brandon Road areas of the waterway. Substituting m/H110052 in Eq. (1.15)
yields

8.2 Determination of deoxygenation rate
and ultimate BOD
Biological decomposition of organic matter is a complex phenomenon.
Laboratory BOD results do not necessarily fit actual stream c onditions.
BOD reaction rate is influenced by immediate demand, stream or  river
dynamic environment, nitrification, sludge deposit, and typ es and con-
centrations of microbes in the water. Therefore, laboratory BOD ana ly-
ses and stream surveys are generally conducted for raw and tr eated
wastewaters and river water to determine BOD reaction rate.
Many investigators have worked on developing and refining method s
and formulas for use in evaluating the deoxygenation ( K1) and reaera-
tion ( K2) constants and the ultimate BOD ( La). There are several meth-
ods proposed to determine K1values. Unfortunately, K1values determined
by different methods given by the same set of data have considerab les12102k1tdy

Public Health Service, 1927) gives the most consistent results,  but it is
time consuming and tedious. Computation using a digital c omputer was
developed by Gannon and Downs (1964).
In 1936, a simplified procedure, the so-called log-difference method
of estimating the constants of the first-stage BOD curve, was p resented
by Fair (1936). The method is also mathematically sound, but is also dif-
ficult to solve.
Thomas (1937) followed Fair et al. (1941a, 1941b) and developed the
“slope” method, which, for many years, was the most used proced ure for
calculating the constants of the BOD curve. Later, Thomas (195 0) pre-
sented a graphic method for BOD curve constants. In the same year,
Moore et al. (1950) developed the “moment” method that was simple, reli-
able, and accurate to analyze BOD data; this soon became the most
used technique for computing the BOD constants.
Researchers found that K1varied considerably for different sources
of wastewaters and questioned the accepted postulate that the 5-d ay
BOD is proportional to the strength of the sewage. Orford and In gram
(1953) discussed the monomolecular equation as being inaccurat e and
unscientific in its relation to BOD. They proposed that the BO D curve
could be expressed as a logarithmic function.
Tsivoglou (1958) proposed a “daily difference” method of BOD data
solved by a semigraphical solution. A “rapid ratio” method c an be solved
using curves developed by Sheehy (1960). O’Connor (1966) modified t he
least-squares method using BOD5.
This book describes Thomas’s slope method, method of moments, log-
arithmic function, and rapid methods calculating K1(or k1) and La.
Slope method. The slope method (Thomas, 1937) gives the BOD con-
stants via the least-squares treatment of the basic form of the fi rst-
order reaction equation or

This differential equation (Eq. (1.16)) is linear between d y/dtand y. Let
y/H11032/H11005dy/dtto be the rate of change of BOD and nbe the number of BOD
measurements minus one. Two normal equations for finding K1and Laare

and Lacan be determined directly by following relations:
K1/H11005–b (1.19)
and
La/H11005–a/b (1.20)
The calculations include first determinations of y/H11032, y/H11032y, and y2for
each value of y. The summation of these gives the quantities of /H9018y/H11032,
/H9018y/H11032y, and /H9018y2which are used for the two normal equations. The values

Moment method. This method requires that BOD measurements must
be a series of regularly spaced time intervals. Calculations are needed
for the sum of the BOD values, /H9018y, accumulated to the end of a series
of time intervals and the sum of the product of time and observed BOD
values, /H9018ty, accumulated to the end of the time series.
The rate constant K1and the ultimate BOD Lacan then be easily
read from a prepared graph by entering values of /H9018y//H9018tyon the appro-
priate scale. Treatments of BOD data with and without lag phase will

a relationship between the observed BOD from domestic sewage and t he
logarithm of the time of observation. If the BOD data are plotted against
the logarithm of time, the resultant curve is approximately a  straight
line. The general equation is expressed as
yt/H11005m logt/H11001 b (1.22)
where mis the slope of the line and bis a constant (the intercept).
The general equation can be transformed by dividing each side b y the
5-day BOD5intercept of the line to give

For domestic sewage oxidation at 20 /H11034C, the straight line through the
observed plotted points, when extrapolated to the log taxis, intercepts
the log taxis at 0.333 days. The general equation is
yt/H11005s(0.85 log t/H110010.41) (1.23a)
where 0.41 is the BOD rate parameter for domestic sewage.
For any observed BOD curve with different oxidation time, the abov e
equation may be generalized as

straight line of best fix is drawn through the plotted points . The time
value of the x-axis intercept is then read, x1(for a standardized domes-
tic sewage sample, this is 0.333). The avalue can be calculated by

Rapid methods. Sheehy (1960) developed two rapid methods for solv-
ing first-order BOD equations. The first method, using the “BOD  slide
rule,” is applicable to the ratios of observations on whole day intervals,
from 1 to 8 days, to the 5-day BOD. The second method, the graph ical
method, can be used with whole or fractional day BOD values.
The BOD slide rule consists of scales A and B for multiplicati on and
division. Scales C and D are the values of and plotted
in relation to values of k1ton the B scale. From given BOD values, the
k1value is easily determined from the BOD slide rule. Unfortunatel y,
the BOD slide rule is not on the market.
The graphical method is based on the same principles as the B OD slide
rule method. Two figures are used to determine k1values directly. One
figure contains k1values based on the ratios of BOD at time t(BODt) to
the 5-day BOD for tless than 5 days. The other figure contains k1val-
ues based on the ratio of BODtto BOD5at times tgreater than 5 days.
The value of k1is determined easily from any one of these figures based
on the ratio of BODtto BOD5.

The ultimate BOD and K1values found in the laboratory at 20 /H11034C have to
be adjusted to river temperatures using the above formulas. Three types of
BOD can be determined: i.e. total, carbonaceous, and nitrogenou s. TBOD
(uninhibited) and CBOD (inhibited with trichloromethylpyrid ine for nitrifi-
cation) are measured directly, while NBOD can be computed by subtracting
CBOD values from TBOD values for given time elements.

data for the Upper Illinois Waterway downstream of Lockport (Butt s and

Figure 1.9 shows most tributary (Kankakee River) BOD charact eris-
tics. The warm weather TBOD20levels for the tributary often approach
those observed at Lockport station (7.03 mg/L versus 8.92 mg/L), but the
fraction of NBOD20is much less (1.19 mg/L versus 5.05 mg/L) (Tables 1.9
and 1.10). Nevertheless, the TBOD20loads coming from the tributaries
are usually much less than those originating from Lockport si nce the trib-
utary flows are normally much lower.
8.4 Second-order reaction
In many cases, researchers stated that a better fit of BOD da ta can
be obtained by using a second-order chemical reaction equation, i.e. the
equation of a rotated rectangular hyperbola. A second-order chemica l
reaction is characterized by a rate of reaction dependent upon th e
concentration of two reactants. It is defined as (Young and Cla rk,
1965):

In most stream survey studies involving oxygen sag equations  (dis-
cussed later), the value of the reoxygenation constant ( K2) is of utmost
importance. Under different conditions, several methods for determin -
ing K2are listed below:
I.K2may be computed from the oxygen sag equation, if all other
parameters are known; however, data must be adequate to support  the
conclusions. A trial-and-error procedure is generally used.
II. The amount of reaeration ( rm) in a reach (station A to station B)
is equal to the BOD exerted ( LaA/H11002LaB) plus oxygen deficiency from sta-
tion A to station B, ( DA/H11002DB). The relationship can be expressed as 
(1.44)
(1.45)
where rmis the amount of reaeration and Dmis the mean (average) deficiency.
Example: Given Lafor the upper and lower sampling stations are 24.6 and
15.8 mg/L, respectively; the DO concentration at these two sta tions are 5.35
and 5.83 mg/L, respectively; and the water temperature is 20 /H11034C; find the K2
value for the river reach.

The value of Dcan be obtained from a field measurement. The value of

from a given point on a river. Thus, K2can be computed from the above
equation.
9.3 Empirical formulas
The factors in the Streeter–Phelps equation has stimulated much
research on the reaeration rate coefficient K2. Considerable controversy
exists as to the proper method of formulas to use. Several empirica l
and semi-empirical formulas have been developed to estimate K2, almost
all of which relate stream velocity and water depth to K2, as first pro-
posed by Streeter (1926). Three equations below are widely known and
employed in stream studies:
O’Connor and Dobbins (1958) (1.52)
Churchill et al. (1962) (1.53)
Langbein and Durum (1967) (1.54)
where K2/H11005reaeration rate coefficient, per day
V/H11005average velocity, ft/s (fps)
H/H11005average water depth, ft
On the basis of K2-related physical aspects of a stream, O’Connor
(1958) and Eckenfelder and O’Connor (1959) proposed K2formulas as
follows:
For an isotropic turbulence (deep stream)
(1.55)
For a nonisotropic stream

The O’Connor and Dobbins equation, Eq. (1.52), is based on a t heory
more general than the formula developed by several of the other invest i-
gators. The formula proposed by Churchill et al. (Eq. (1.53)) appears to be
more restrictive in use. The workers from the US Geological Survey
(Langbein and Durum, 1967) have analyzed and summarized the w ork of
several investigators and concluded that the velocities and c ross section
information were the most applicable formulation of the reaeration fa ctor.
Example: A stream has an average depth of 9.8 ft (3.0 m) and velocity of fl ow
of 0.61 ft/s (0.20 m/s). What are the K2values determined by the first three
empirical formulas in this section (Eqs. (1.52) to (1.54))? What  is K2at 25 /H11034C
of water temperature (use Eq. (1.54) only).

The clear periphytonic chamber is not used if periphytonic prod uctivity/
respiration is deemed insignificant, i.e. POD /H110050. The combined effect
of TBOD – PAP is represented by the gross output of the light cha mber,
and the SOD is equal to the gross SOD chamber output less t han dark
chamber output.
The DO deficit Din the reach is calculated as

where S1and S2are the DO saturation concentration in mg/L at t1and
t2, respectively, for the average water temperature ( T) in the reach.
The DO saturation formula is given in the preview section (Eq. (1.4)).
Since the Hydrolab’s DataSondes logged data at hourly interva ls, the
DO changes attributable to physical aeration (or deaeration) a re avail-
able for small time frames, which permits the following modifica tion of
the basic natural reaeration equation to be used to calculate K2values

10 Sediment Oxygen Demand
Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) is measure of the oxygen demand char-
acteristics of the bottom sediment which affects the dissolved oxy gen
resources of the overlying water. To measure SOD, a bottom sample is
especially designed to entrap and seal a known quantity of wa ter at the
river bottom. Changes in DO concentrations (approximately 2 h , or until
the DO usage curve is clearly defined) in the entrapped water a re
recorded by a DO probe fastened in the sampler (Butts, 1974). Th e test
temperature should be recorded and factored for temperature correction
at a specific temperature.
SOD curves can be plotted showing the accumulated DO used ( y-axis)
versus elapsed time ( x-axis). SOD curves resemble first-order car-
bonaceous BOD curves to a great extent; however, first-order kineti cs
are not applicable to the Upper Illinois Waterway’s data. For  the most
part, SOD is caused by bacteria reaching an “unlimited”  food supply.
Consequently, the oxidation rates are linear in nature.K25REA

11 Organic Sludge Deposits
Solids in wastewaters may be in the forms of settleable, floccula tion or
coagulation of colloids, and suspended. When these solids are bein g car-
ried in a river or stream, there is always a possibility t hat the velocity
of flow will drop to some value at which sedimentation will occu r. The
limiting velocity at which deposition will occur is probab ly about 0.5 to
0.6 ft/s (15 to 18 cm/s).
Deposition of organic solids results in a temporary reduction i n the
BOD load of the stream water. Almost as soon as organic matter  is
deposited, the deposits will start undergoing biological decomp osition,dC

          53.77 smg/Ld 52 Chapter 1which results in some reduction in the DO concentration of the water
adjacent to the sediment material. As the deposited organic ma tter
increases in volume, the rate of decomposition also increases. Ult imately,
equilibrium will be established. Velz (1958) has shown that at equilib-
rium the rate of decomposition (exertion of a BOD) equals the rate of
deposition.
In order to properly evaluate the effects of wastewater on the oxygen
resources of a stream, it may be necessary to account for the cont ribu-
tion made by solids being deposited or by sediments being scour ed and
carried into suspension.
From field observations, Velz (1958) concluded that enriched sedi-
ments will deposit and accumulate at a stream velocity of 0. 6 ft/s (18 cm/s)
or less, and resuspension of sediments and scouring will occur  at a flow
velocity of 1.0 to 1.5 ft/s (30 to 45 cm/s). Velz (1958) has repor ted that
the effect of sludge deposits can be expressed mathematically. The a ccu-
mulation of sludge deposition ( Ld) is

This means that in 2 days, 188% of daily deposit ( Pd) will have been accu-
mulated in the deposit area, and 13% of Pdwill have been oxidized. The rate
of utilization is about 6.9% per day of accumulated sludge BOD . 51.88Pd 5Pd

In 50 days, 1403% of daily deposit will have been accumulat ed and the rate

suggests that equilibrium is almost reached in approximat ely 50 days, if
there is no disturbance from increased flow.
12 Photosynthesis and Respiration
Processes of photosynthesis and respiration by aquatic plants such as
phytoplankton (algae), periphyton, and rooted aquatic plants (macro-
phytes) could significantly affect the DO concentrations in th e water col-
umn. Plant photosynthesis consumes nutrients and carbon diox ide
under the light, and produces oxygen. During dark condition s, and dur-
ing respiration, oxygen is used. The daily average oxygen produ ction and
reduction due to photosynthesis and respiration can be expressed  in
the QUALZE model as (US EPA, 1997):

13 Natural Self-Puriﬁcation in Streams
When decomposable organic waste is discharged into a stream, a  series
of physical, chemical, and biological reactions are initiat ed and there-
after the stream ultimately will be relieved of its pullutive b urden. This
process is so-called natural self-purification. A stream undergoi ng self-
purification will exhibit continuously changing water qua lity charac-
teristics throughout the reach of the stream.
Dissolved oxygen concentrations in water are perhaps the most i mpor-
tant factor in determining the overall effect of decomposable organic
matters in a stream. It is also necessary to maintain man dated DO lev-
els in a stream. Therefore, the type and the degree of wastewater trea t-
ment necessary depend primarily on the condition and best usa ge of the
receiving stream.
Recently the US Environmental Protection Agency has revised the
water quality model QUALZE for total maximum daily loads to rivers
and streams (US EPA, 1997). Interested readers may refer to an excel-
lent example of total maximum daily load analysis in Append ix B of the
US EPA technical guidance manual.
13.1 Oxygen sag curve
The dissolved oxygen balance in a stream which is receiving w aste-
water effluents can be formulated from a combination of the rate of oxy -
gen utilization through BOD and oxygen transfer from the atmosp here
into water. Many factors involved in this process are discus sed in the
previous sections. The oxygen sag curve (DO balance) is as a res ult of
DO added minus DO removed. The oxygen balance curve or oxygen pr o-
file can be mathematically expressed (Streeter–Phelps, 1925) as p revi-
ously discussed:
(1.8b)
where k1and k2are, respectively, deoxygenation and reoxygenation rates
to the base 10 which are popularly used. Since k1is determined under lab-
oratory conditions, the rate of oxygen removed in a stream by oxid ation
may be different from that under laboratory conditions. Thus, a term kdDt5k1La
k22k1 s102k1t2102k2td1Da3102k2tStreams and Rivers 55is often substituted. Likewise, the rate of BOD removal in a str eam may
not equal the deoxygenation rate in a laboratory bottle and the oxidation
rate in a stream, so the term kris used to reflect this situation. Applying
these modified terms, the oxygen sag equation becomes
(1.69)
If deposition occurs, krwill be greater than k1; and if scour of sediment
organic matter occurs, krwill be less then k1.
Computation of organic waste load-capacity of streams or rivers may
be carried out by using Eq. (1.69) (the following example), the Th omas
method, the Churchill–Buckingham method, and other methods.
Example: Station 1 receives a secondary effluent from a city. BOD loading  at
station 2 is negligible. The results of two river samplings a t stations 3 and 4
(temperature, flow rates, BOD5, and DO) are adopted from Nemerow (1963) and
are shown below. Construct an oxygen sag curve between stations  3 and 4.

Thomas method. Thomas (1948) developed a useful simplification of the
Streeter-Phelps equation for evaluating stream waste–assimilativ e
capacity. His method presumes the computation of the stream deoxy -
genation coefficient ( k1) and reoxygenation coefficient ( k2) as defined in
previous sections (also example). He developed a nomograph to calcu-
late the DO deficit at any time, t(DO profile), downstream from a
source of pollution load. The nomograph (not shown, the interested
reader should refer to his article) is plotted as D/Laversus k2tfor var-
ious ratios of k2/k1. In most practical applications, this can be solved
only by a tedious trial-and-error procedure. Before the nomograph is
used, k1, k2, Da, and Lamust be computed (can be done as in the pre-
vious example). By means of a straightedge, a straight line (i sopleth)
is drawn, connecting the value of Da/Laat the left of the point repre-
senting the reaeration constant /H11003time of travel ( k2t) on the appropri-
ate k2/k1curve (a vertical line at k2tand intercept on the k2/k1curve).
The value Da/Lais read at the intersection with the isopleth. Then, the
value of the deficit at time t(Dt) is obtained by multiplying Lawith the
interception value.
Nemerow (1963) claimed that he had applied the Thomas nomograph
in many practical cases and found it very convenient, accu rate, and
timesaving. He presented a practical problem-solving example for an
industrial discharge to a stream. He illustrated three differen t DO pro-
files along a 38-mile river: i.e. (1) under current loading and  flow con-
ditions; (2) imposition of an industrial load at the upstream  station
under current condition; and (3) imposition of industrial load  under 5-
year low-stream conditions.
Churchill–Buckingham method. Churchill and Buckingham (1956)
found that the DO values in streams depend on only three varia bles:
temperature, BOD, and stream flow. They used multiple linear c orre-
lation with three normal equations based on the principle of lea st
squares:

obtained. Then, the DO drop is expressed as
(1.73)
This method eliminates the often questionable and always cumbers ome
procedure for determining k1, k2, kd, and kr. Nemerow (1963) reported
that this method provides a good correlation if each stream sam ple is
collected during maximum or minimum conditions of one of the thr ee
variables. Only six samples are required in a study to pr oduce practi-
cal and dependable results.
Example: Data obtained from six different days’ stream surveys during
medium- and low-flow periods showed that the DO sag occurred betw een sta-
tions 2 and 4. The results and computation are as shown in Table 1.12.

drop values are reasonably close.
Step 4. Compute the allowable BOD loading at the source of the pol lution
The BOD equation can be derived from the same least-squares method by cor-
relating the upstream BOD load (as x1) with the water temperature (as x2),
flow rate (as x3), and resulting BOD (as z) at the sag point in the stream.
Similar to steps 1 and 2, the DO drop is replaced by BOD at station 4 (not
shown). It will generate an equation for the allowable BOD load:
z/H11005ax1/H11001bx2/H11001cx3/H11001d
Then, applying the percent of wastewater treatment reduction, th e BOD in
the discharge effluent is calculated as x1. Selecting the design temperature
and low-flow data, one can then predict the BOD load (lb/d or m g/L) from the
above equation. Also, applying zmg/L in the DO drop equation gives the pre-
dicted value for DO drop at the sag.
13.2 Determination of kr
The value krcan be determined for a given reach of stream by deter-
mining the BOD of water samples from the upper (A) and lower (B) en ds

In many cases, only the lowest point of the oxygen sag curve is  of inter-
est to engineers. The equation can be modified to give the critical  value
for DO deficiency ( Dc) and the critical time ( tc) downstream at the crit-
ical point. At the critical point of the curve, the rate of deox ygenation

The highest temperature of the river water during the critical flow period is

bonaceous 5-day BOD of 7.8 mg/L; an ammonia–nitrogen concentrat ion of
2.3 mg/L, and DO for 2.0 mg/L. Average DO concentration in t he river upstream
of the discharge is 6.80 mg/L. After the mixing of the effluent wi th the river
water, the carbonaceous deoxygenation rate coefficient ( KrCor KC) is estimated
at 0.25 per day (base e) at 20 /H11034C and the nitrogenous deoxygenation coefficient
(KrNor KN) is 0.66 per day at 20 /H11034C. The lag time ( t0) is approximately 1.0 day.
The river cross section is fairly constant with mean width of 30 ft (10 m) and
mean depth of 4.5 ft (1.5 m). Compute DO deficits against time t.

Step 9. Explanation
From Table 1.15, it can be seen that minimum DO of 5.60 mg/ L occurred at
t/H110050.8 days due to carbonaceous demand. After this location, the stream
starts recovery. However, after t/H110051.0 day, the stream DO is decreasing due
to nitrogenous demand. At t/H110052.0, it is the critical location (22.22 miles below
the outfall) with a critical DO deficit of 3.83 mg/L and the DO level in the

15 Apportionment of Stream Users
In the United States, effluent standards for wastewater treatmen t
plants are generally set for BOD, total suspended solids (TSS), and
ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) concentrations. Each plant often should
meet standards of 10–10–12 (mg/L for BOD, TSS, and NH3-N, respec-
tively), right or wrong. It is not like classically consid ering the maximum
use of stream-assimilative capacity. However, in some parts of th e world,
maximum usage of stream natural self-purification capacity m ay be a
valuable tool for cost saving of wastewater treatment. Thus, some con-
cepts of apportionment of self-purification capacity of a stream am ong
different users are presented below.
The permissible load equation can be used to compute the BOD load -

Approach)
Previous sections discuss the conceptual approach of the relation ships
between BOD loading and DO in the stream. Another approach for
determining the waste-assimilative capacity of a stream is a  method
first developed and used by Black and Phelps (1911) and later refined and
used by Velz (1939). For this method, deoxygenation and reoxygenati on
computations are made separately, then added algebraically t o obtain the
net oxygen balance. This procedure can be expressed mathematical ly as
(1.110)
where DOnet/H11005dissolved oxygen at the end of a reach
DOa/H11005initial dissolved oxygen at beginning of a reach
DOrea/H11005dissolved oxygen absorbed from the atmosphere
DOused/H11005dissolved oxygen consumed biologically
All units are in lb/d or kg/d.
16.1 Dissolved oxygen used
The dissolved oxygen used (BOD) can be computed with only field-
observed dissolved oxygen concentrations and the Velz reoxygenation
curve. From the basic equation, the dissolved oxygen used in pou nds per
day can be expressed as:
The terms DOaand DOnetare the observed field dissolved oxygen val-
ues at the beginning and end of a subreach, respectively, and  DOreais
the reoxygenation in the subreach computed by the Velz curve. If the dis-
solved oxygen usage in the river approximates a first-order biolog ical
reaction, a plot of the summations of the DOusedversus time of travel can
be fitted to the equation:
(1.111)
and Laand K1are determined experimentally in the same manner as
for the Streeter–Phelps method. The fitting of the computed values to
the equations must be done by trial and error, and a digita l computer
is utilized to facilitate this operation.
16.2 Reaeration
The reaeration term (DOrea) in the equation is the most difficult to deter-
mine. In their original work, Black and Phelps (1911) experim entallyDO used 5La[12exps2K1td]DO used 5sDO a2DO netd1DO rea sin lb/ddDO net5DO a1DO rea2DO usedStreams and Rivers 87derived a reaeration equation based on principles of gas transfer  of dif-

Although the theory upon which this reaeration equation was d evel-
oped is for quiescent conditions, it is still applicable to m oving, and
even turbulent, streams. This can be explained in either of two ways
(Phelps, 1944):
(1) Turbulence actually decreases the effective depth through whic h
diffusions operate. Thus, in a turbulent stream, mixing brin gs lay-
ers of saturated water from the surface into intimate contact wi th
other less oxygenated layers from below. . . The actual  extent of s uch
mixing is difficult to envision, but it clearly depends upon  the fre-
quency with which surface layers are thus transported. In this
change-of-depth concept, therefore, there is a time element involved.
(2) The other and more practical concept is a pure time effect. It is
assumed that the actual existing conditions of turbulence ca n be
replaced by an equivalent condition composed of successive periods
of perfect quiescence between which there is instantaneous andR5100a12B0

time of exposure in the diffusion formula, and the total aeration p er
hour is the sum of the successive increments or, for practical purposes,
the aeration period multiplied by the periods per hour.
Because the reaeration equation involves a series expansion in it s
solution, it is not readily solved by desk calculations. To facilitate the
calculations, Velz (1939, 1947) published a slide-rule curve solution to
the equation. This slide-rule curve is reprinted here as Fig. 1. 11 (for its
use, consult Velz, 1947). Velz’s curve has been verified as accu rate by two
independent computer checks, one by Gannon (1963) and the other b y
Butts (1963).
Although the Velz curve is ingenious, it is somewhat cumbersom e to
use. Therefore, a nomograph (Butts and Schnepper, 1967) was develop ed
for a quick, accurate desk solution of R at zero initial DO( B0in the
Black and Phelps equation). The nomograph, presented in Fig. 1.1 2, was
constructed on the premise that the exposure or mix time is cha racter-
ized by the equation
M/H11005(13.94)loge (H) – 7.45 (1.114)

This relationship was derived experimentally and reported by G annon
(1963) as valid for streams having average depths greater tha n 3 ft. ForStreams and Rivers 89

an initial DO greater than zero, the nomograph value is mult iplied by
(1 – B0) expressed as a fraction because the relationship between B0and
the equation is linear.
The use of the nomograph and the subsequent calculations required
to compute the oxygen absorption are best explained by the exampl e that
follows:
Example: Given that H/H1100512.3 ft; initial DO of stream /H1100548% of saturation;
T/H1100516.2 /H11034C; DO load at saturation at 16.2 /H11034C /H110058800 lb; and time of travel in
the stream reach /H110050.12 days. Find the mix time ( M) in minutes; the percent
DO absorbed per mix at time zero initial DO ( R0); and the total amount of oxy-
gen absorbed in the reach (DOrea).
solution:
Step 1. Determine Mand R0
From Fig. 1.12, connect 12.3 ft on the depth-scale with 16.2 /H11034C on the
temperature scale. It can be read that:
M/H1100527.5 min on the mix timescale, and
R0/H110050.19% on the R0-scale
Step 2. Compute DOrea
Since R0is the percent of the saturated DO absorbed per mix when the in i-
tial DO is at 100% deficit (zero DO), the oxygen absorbed per mix  at 100%
deficit will be the product of R0and the DO load at saturation. For this exam-
ple, lb/mix per 100% deficit is
However, the actual DO absorbed (at 48% saturation) per mix is only
Because the amount absorbed is directly proportional to the defic it, the num-
ber of mixes per reach must be determined:

17 Stream DO Model (a Pragmatic
Approach)
Butts and his coworkers (Butts et al ., 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1981;
Butts, 1974; Butts and Shackleford, 1992) of the Illinois S tate Water
Survey expanded Velz’s oxygen balance equation. For the pragmati c
approach to evaluate the BOD/DO relationship in a flowing st ream, it
is formulated as follows:
(1.116)
where DOn/H11005net dissolved oxygen at the end of a stream reach
DOa/H11005initial dissolved oxygen at the beginning of a reach
DOu/H11005dissolved oxygen consumed biologically within a reach
DOr/H11005dissolved oxygen derived from natural reaeration
within a reach
DOx/H11005dissolved oxygen derived from channel dams,
tributaries, etc.
Details of computation procedures for each component of the above
equation have been outlined in several reports mentioned above.
Basically the above equation uses the same basic concepts as employed
in the application of the Streeter–Phelps expression and expands the
Velz oxygen balance equation by adding DOx. The influences of dams and
tributaries are discussed below.
17.1 Inﬂuence of a dam
Low head channel dams and large navigation dams are very im por-
tant factors when assessing the oxygen balance in a stream. There are
certain disadvantages from a water quality standpoint ass ociated
with such structures but their reaeration potential is sig nificant
during overflow, particularly if a low DO concentration exist s in theDO n5DO a2DO u1DO r1DO x 554.6 slbd 58.736.28 5a1248

considered.
Procedures for estimating reaeration at channel dams and weirs have
been developed by researchers in England (Gameson, 1957; Gameson
et al., 1958; Barrett et al., 1960; Grindrod, 1962). The methods are eas-
ily applied and give satisfactory results. Little has been d one in devel-
oping similar procedures for large navigation and power dams.  Preul and
Holler (1969) investigated larger structures.
Often in small sluggish streams, more oxygen may be absorbed by
water overflowing a channel dam than in a long reach between d ams.
However, if the same reach were free flowing, this might not be the
case; i.e. if the dams were absent, the reaeration in the same s tretch of
river could conceivably be greater than that provided by overfl ow at a
dam. If water is saturated with oxygen, no uptake occurs at  the dam
overflow. If it is supersaturated, oxygen will be lost during dam over-
flow. Water, at a given percent deficit, will gain oxygen.
The basic channel dam reaeration formula takes the general form
(1.117)
where r/H11005dissolved oxygen deficit ratio at temperature T
q/H11005water quality correction factor
b/H11005weir correction factor
T/H11005water temperature, /H11034C

The deficit dissolved oxygen ratio is defined by the expression
(1.118)
where CA/H11005dissolved oxygen concentration upstream of the dam, mg/L
CB/H11005dissolved oxygen concentration downstream of the
dam, mg/L
Cs/H11005dissolved oxygen saturation concentration, mg/L
DA/H11005dissolved oxygen deficit upstream of the dam, mg/L
DB/H11005dissolved oxygen deficit downstream of the dam, mg/L
Although Eqs. (1.117) and (1.118) are rather simplistic an d do not
include all potential parameters which could affect the reaerat ion of
water overflowing a channel dam, they have been found to be quite reli-
able in predicting the change in oxygen content of water passi ng over a
dam or weir (Barrett et al., 1960). The degree of accuracy in using the
equations is dependent upon the estimate of factors qand b.
For assigning values for q, three generalized classifications of water
have been developed from field observations. They are q/H110051.25 for clean
or slightly polluted water; q/H110051.0 for moderately polluted water; and
q/H110050.8 for grossly polluted water. A slightly polluted water is one inr5sCs2CAd/sCs2CBd5DA/DBr5110.11qbs110.46TdhStreams and Rivers 93which no noticeable deterioration of water quality exists from sew age
discharges; a moderately polluted stream is one which receives a sig-
nificant quantity of sewage effluent; and a grossly polluted st ream is one
in which noxious conditions exist.
For estimating the value of b, the geometrical shape of the dam is
taken into consideration. This factor is a function of the ratio of weir coef-
ficients Wof various geometrical designs to that of a free weir where
W/H11005(r– 1)/h (1.119)
Weir coefficients have been established for a number of spillway ty pes,
and Gameson (1957) in his original work has suggested assig ning bval-
ues as follows:
Spillway type b
Free 1.0
Step 1.3
Slope (ogee) 0.58
Slopping channel 0.17
For special situations, engineering judgment is required. For ex ample,
a number of channel dams in Illinois are fitted with flashboa rds during
the summer. In effect, this creates a free fall in combination wi th some
other configuration. A value of b, say 0.75, could be used for a flashboard
installation on top of an ogee spillway (Butts et al., 1973). This combi-
nation would certainly justify a value less than 1.0, tha t for a free weir,
because the energy dissipation of the water flowing over the flashb oards
onto the curved ogee surface would not be as great as that for a fl at sur-
face such as usually exists below free and step weirs.
Aeration at a spillway takes place in three phases: (1) duri ng the fall;
(2) at the apron from splashing; and (3) from the diffusion of oxygen  due
to entrained air bubbles. Gameson (1957) has found that littl e aeration
occurs in the fall. Most DO uptake occurs at the apron; cons equently, the
greater the energy dissipation at the apron, the greater the aer ation.
Therefore, if an ogee spillway is designed with an energy dissipa ter, such
as a hydraulic jump, the value of bshould increase accordingly.
Example: Given CA/H110053.85 mg/L, T/H1100524.8 /H11034C, h/H110056.6 ft (1.0 m), q/H110050.9,
and b/H110050.30 (because of hydraulic jump use 0.30).

17.2 Inﬂuence of tributaries
Tributary sources of DO are often an important contribution in  deriv-
ing a DO balance in stream waters. These sources may be trib utary
streams or outfalls of wastewater treatment plants. A tributar y con-
tribution of DOxcan be computed based on mass balance basis of DO,
ammonia, and BOD values from tributaries. The downstream effect
of any DO input is determined by mass balance computations:  in
terms of pounds per day the tributary load can simply add to the
mainstream load occurring above the confluence. The following two
examples are used to demonstrate the influence of tributary sources
of DO. Example 1 involves a tributary stream. Example 2 in volves the
design of an outfall structure to achieve a minimum DO at th e point
of discharge.
Example 1: Given: Tributary flow Q1/H11005123 cfs
Tributary DO /H110056.7 mg/L
Mainstream flow Q2/H11005448 cfs

at the point of discharge. The flow of wastewater effluent and the st ream are,
respectively, 6.19 and 14.47 cfs (175 and 410 L/s, or 4 an d 10 MGD). DO for the
effluent and stream are 1.85 and 6.40 mg/L, respectively. The t emperature of
the effluent is 18.9 /H11034C. The stream is less than moderately polluted. Determine

The term DOused(DOu) in Eq. (1.111) represents the oxygen consumed
biologically within a stream reach. This term can be determi ned by
three methods (Butts et al., 1973): (1) observed DO concentrations in con-
junction with reaeration estimate; (2) bottle BOD and deoxygenat ion
rate determinations of river water samples; and (3) long-term bott le
BOD progression evaluation of a wastewater effluent. The method used
will probably be dictated by the existing data or the resour ces available
for collecting usable data.
The term DOuincludes DO usage due to carbonaceous and nitrogenous
BOD and to SOD, as stated previously. The ratio of DO contrib ution by algal
photosynthesis to DO consumption by algal respiration is as sumed to be
unity, although it can handle values greater or less than one when derived
on a diurnal basis. For a series of stream reaches, each increm ental DOu
value is added and the accumulated sums, with the correspon ding time of
travel in the stream, are fitted to the first-order exponential exp ression

Note : The coefficient Kdis comparable to the composite of the terms KC
and KNpreviously defined in the discussion regarding the conceptual
approach to waste-assimilative analysis.
The use of field DO values in estimating the waste-degradation ch ar-
acteristics of a stream has certain advantages: the need for l aboratory
BOD tests is eliminated which saves time and cost; the reli ability of the
results should be better since the measurement of DO is far more p recise
and accurate than the BOD test; also, stream measured DO c oncentrations
take into account the in situ oxygen demand in the stream, w hich includes
both dissolved and benthic demand, whereas laboratory BOD res ults gen-
erally reflect only the oxygen demand exerted by dissolved matter.
Estimations of KdandLa.The data obtained from steam survey, a sum-
mation of DOuvalues and corresponding time of travel tat an observed
water temperature, have to be computed along the reach of a stream .
Nowadays, for determinations of Kdand La, one can simplify the calcu-
lation by using a computer or a programmable calculator. How ever, the
following example illustrates the use of the Thomas slope method for
determining Kdand La.y5Las12e2Kdtd98 Chapter 117.4 Procedures of pragmatic approach
The steps of the pragmatic approach involved in estimating th e waste-
assimilative capacity of a stream based upon a pragmatic approach can
be summarized as follows (Butts et al., 1973):
1. Develop a full understanding of the stream length, its chan nel geom-
etry, water stage and flow patterns, and the general hydrologi c fea-
tures of the watershed.
2. Determine the 7-day, 10-year flow of the stream and select a desi gn
water temperature.
3. Define the location of all dams and their physical features; define
also the location of all tributary flows and relevant data reg arding
them.
4. Divide the stream into reaches consistent with significant  changes
in cross sections and determine the volumes and average depth i n
each reach.
5. At the beginning and end of each reach, during low-flow condi tions
and summer temperatures, undertake a series of field determina-
tions for at least water temperature and DO concentrations and , if
desired, collect water samples for BOD determinations.
6. Compute the time of travel within each reach at stream flows
observed during the time of sampling as well as that during  7-day,
10-year low flow.
7. From the observed DO values, flow, and time of travel, compute
DOa– DOn, as demonstrated in Table 1.17 (see later).
8. Select DO saturation values from Table 1.2 for observed stream
temperature conditions, and compute the natural reaeration for
each reach using Figs. 1.12 and 1.13 in conjunction with  appropri-
ate equations for finding the mix time Mand the percent absorption
at 100% deficit R0. They are determined as the same manner of the
example in Section 16.2. Keep in mind the need to make adjustm ents
in accordance with weir and mass balance formulas where dam s and
tributaries are encountered.
9. Calculate, by summation, the DOufor each reach as demonstrated
in Table 1.18 (see later).
10. From an array of the DOuversus tdata, determine Laand Kd,
preferably by the methods of Read–Theriault, steepest descent,
or least squares. For a graphical solution, the Thomas slope
method is satisfactory. Adjust the values for Laand Kdfor the
selected design water temperature by the use of Eqs. (1.26) and
(1.28).Streams and Rivers 9911. Apply the removal efficiency anticipated to the computed ult i-
mate oxygen demand Laand develop the required expression DOu/H11005
La(1 – e–Kt).
12. From the values developed in step 6 for time of travel and depth  at
7-day, 10-year low flow, use the observed DO just upstream of the
discharge point ( Daat the beginning of the reach) as a starting-
point, and follow the computation.
13. Note whether or not the removal efficiency selected will permit p re-
dicted DO concentrations in the stream compatible with water  qual-
ity standards.
Example: A long reach of a moderately sized river is investigated. There is
an overloaded secondary wastewater treatment plant dischargin g its efflu-
ent immediately above sampling station 1 (upstream). The plant , correctly,
has BOD removal efficiency of 65%. A total of 12 sampling station s are estab-
lished in reaches of the study river. Downstream stations 3 a nd 4 are above
and below an ogee channel dam, respectively. Stations 10 and 11 are imme-
diately above and below the confluence of the main stream and a t ributary
which has relatively clean water. The 7-day, 10-year low flow of the main
receiving stream and the tributary are 660 and 96 cfs, res pectively. The design
water temperature is selected as 27 /H11034C.
A stream field survey for flow, water temperature, DO, average dept h, and
time of travel is conducted during summer low-flow conditions. D uring the100 Chapter 1

field survey, the receiving stream in the vicinity of the effluent  discharge was
822 cfs and the tributary flow was 111 cfs. The DO values a re 5.96 and 6.2
mg/L, respectively. Data obtained from field measurements and su bsequent
computations for DO values are presented in Tables 1.16, 1.17 , and 1.18. The
DO levels in the stream are not less than 5.0 mg/L, as requi red.
Question : Determine the DO concentrations along the reach of the stream a t
design temperature and design flow conditions, if the efficiency of sewage
treatment plant is updated to at least 90% BOD removal.
Answer : The solution is approached in two sessions: (1) the deoxygenation
rate coefficients Kdand Lashould be determined under the existing condi-
tions; this involves steps 1 to 5; (2) a predictive profile of DO  concentrations
will be calculated under 7-day, 10-year low flow and 27ºC des ign conditions
(steps 6 and 7).
solution:
Step 1. Compute DO values
In Table 1.16, data are obtained from fieldwork and subsequent  DO compu-
tations for other purposes. The term DOa/H11002DOn(lb/d) will be used in the equa-
tion for Table 1.18. A plot of DO measured and time of travel tcan be made
(not shown). It suggests that a profound DO sag exists in th e stream below
the major pollution source of effluent discharge.
Step 2. Compute the natural reaeration, DOr
In Table 1.17, values of saturated DO (DOs) at the specified water tempera-
ture are obtained from Table 1.2. The values of Mand R0are taken from Figs.
1.12 and 1.13 on the basis of the physical dimension of the s tream listed in
Table 1.16 or calculated from Eq. (1.114) ( M/H1100513.94 In H/H11002745).
Step 3. Calculate DO used, DOu
The DOuis calculated from equation DOu/H11005(DOa/H11002DOn) /H11001DOr/H11001DOx.
Without consideration of DOx, the values of DOufor each reach of the stream
are given in Table 1.18. It should be noted that DOxdoes not apply yet.
Step 4. Determine Kd(23)and Ld(23)for T/H1100523ºC (during the field survey)
Using the Thomas (1950) slope method, the factor ( /H9018t//H9018DOu)1/3is plotted
on arithmetic graph paper against /H9018tas shown in Fig. 1.14. A line of best
fit is then drawn, often neglecting the first two points. The ord inate inter-

Step 6. Calculate the design BOD loading after plant improvem ent
Since the current overloaded wastewater treatment plant only rem oves 65%
of the incoming BOD load, the raw wastewater BOD load is
89,800 lb/d/(1 /H110020.65) /H11005256,600(lb/d)
The expanded (updated) activated-sludge process may be expected to r emove
90% to 95% of the BOD load from the raw wastewater. For the safe sid e, 90%
removal is selected for the design purpose. Therefore, the design load Laat
27/H11034C to the stream will be 25,660 lb/d (256,600 /H110030.1).
Step 7. Gather new input data for DO profile
In order to develop the predictive profile for DO concentration in t he receiv-
ing stream after the expanded secondary wastewater treatment pl ant is func-
tioning, the following design factors are obtained from field surv ey data and
the results computed:
Stream flow /H11005660 cfs At the dam q/H110051.1
Tributary flow /H1100596 cfs b/H110050.58

station from upstream downward. The other columns can be calcu lated inde-
pendently. At station 4 (below the dam), the dam aeration rati o is given as
Eqs. (1.117) and (1.118)
This DO value of 6.45 mg/L is inserted into column 21 at sta tion 4. The cor-
responding DOn(in lb/d) is computed by multiplying 5.39 Qto obtain 23,148
lb/d, which is inserted into column 20 at station 4.
At station 11, immediately below the tributary, DO contrib ution is 3208
lb/d (i.e. 5.39 /H110036.2 /H1100396). This value plus 28,068 lb/d (31,276 lb/d) is inserted
into column 20. Then computations continue with iterative proc edures for
station 12.
It should be noted that the parameters H, M, t/H11032, t/H11032/M, and R/100 can be com-
puted earlier (i.e. in earlier columns). Therefore, the other DO compu tations
will be in the latter part of Table 1.19. It seems easier for ob servation. Also,
these steps of computation can be easily programmed using a com puter.
The results of computations for solving equation, DOn/H11005DOa/H11002DOu/H11001
DOr/H11001DOxare given in Table 1.19, and the DO concentrations in colum n 21
of Table 1.19 are the predictive DO values for 7-day, 10-year low  flow with sec-
ondary wastewater treatment. All DO values are above the regul atory stan-
dard of 5.0 mg/L, owing to expanded wastewater treatment and d am aeration.
18 Biological Factors
18.1 Algae
Algae are most commonly used to assess the extent that primary  pro-
ductivity (algal activity) affects the DO resources of surface w aters.
Many factors affect the distribution, density, and species com position of
algae in natural waters. These include the physical charac teristics of the
water, length of storage, temperature, chemical composition, in situ
reproduction and elimination, floods, nutrients, human activ ities, trace
elements, and seasonal cycles.
Of the many methods suggested for defining the structure of a bio-
logical community, the most widely used procedure has been the diver-
sity index. A biological diversity index provides a means of ev aluatingCB522.78/1.9617.8756.45 smg/Ld1.965s7.8725.09d/s7.872CBdr5sCs2CAd/sCs2CBd 51.960 5110.1131.130.58s110.046327d36.1r5110.11qbs110.046 TdhStreams and Rivers 107the richness of species within a biological community using a mathe-
matical computation. Although different formulas have been used,  the
one determined by the information theory formula, the Shannon /H11002Weiner
diversity index, is widely used for algal communities or comm unities of
other organisms. The formula is (Shannon and Weaver, 1949):

or
(1.122)
The index Dhas a minimum value, when a community consisting
solely of one ( m/H110051) species has no diversity or richness and takes on
a value of unity. As the number of species increases and as lon g as each
species is relatively equal in number, the diversity index i ncreases
numerically. It reaches a maximum value when m/H11005N.
Example: Seven species of algae are present in a stream water sample. The
numbers of seven species per mL are 32, 688, 138, 98, 1320, 4 24, and 248,
respectively. Compute the diversity index of this algal commun ity.

18.2 Indicator bacteria
Pathogenic bacteria, pathogenic protozoan cysts, and viruses h ave been
isolated from wastewaters and natural waters. The sources of thes e
pathogens are the feces of humans and of wild and domestic anima ls.
Identification and enumeration of these disease-causing organisms  in
water and wastewater are not recommended because no single techni queD521.44/H9018m

i51Pi log 2 Pi108 Chapter 1is currently available to isolate and identify all the path ogens. In fact,
concentrations of these pathogens are generally low in water and waste-
water. In addition, the methods for identification and enumerat ion of
pathogens are labor-intensive and expensive.
Instead of direct isolation and enumeration of path ogens, total coliform
(TC) has long been used as an indicator of pathogen contamination  of a
water that poses a public health risk. Fecal coliform (FC), whi ch is more
fecal-specific, has been adopted as a standard indicator of cont amina-
tion in natural waters in Illinois, Indiana, and many other states. Both
TC and FC are used in standards for drinking-water and natu ral waters.
Fecal streptococcus (FS) is used as a pollution indicator in Eu rope.
FC/FS ratios have been employed for identifying pollution sources in  the
United States. Fecal streptococci are present in the intestines of warm-
blooded animals and of insects, and they are present in the env ironment
(water, soil, and vegetation) for long periods of time. Escherichia coli bac-
teria have also been used as an indicator.
Calculation of bacterial density. The determination of indicator bacteria,
total coliform, fecal coliform, and fecal streptococcus or enterococcu s is
very important for assessing the quality of natural waters, drinking-
waters, and wastewaters. The procedures for enumeration of these
organisms are presented elsewhere (APHA et al., 1995). Examinations
of indicator bacterial density in water and in wastewater a re generally
performed by using a series of four-decimal dilutions per sample, with
3 to 10, usually 5, tubes for each dilution. Various specia l broths are used
for the presumptive, confirmation, and complete tests for each of th e bac-
teria TC, FC, and FS, at specified incubation temperatures and  periods.
MPN method. Caliform density is estimated in terms of the most prob-
able number (MPN). The multiple-tube fermentation procedure is often
called an MPN procedure. The MPN values for a variety of inoculati on
series are listed in Table 1.21. These values are based on a ser ies of five
tubes for three dilutions. MPN values are commonly determined usi ngStreams and Rivers 109

For the MPN index for combinations not appearing in Table 1.21 or for
other combinations of dilutions or numbers of tubes used, the MPN can
be estimated by the Thomas equation:

Although the MPN tables and calculations are described for us e in the

any other organisms for which suitable test media are availa ble.

20.2330.55Streams and Rivers 113Membrane ﬁlter method. The membrane filtration (MF) method is the
most widely used method. Calculations of MF results for these ind ica-
tors or other organisms are presented here (Illinois EPA, 1987):
Step 1. Select the membrane filter with the number of colonies in t he
acceptable range
The acceptable range for TC is 20 to 80 TC colonies and no more tha n 200
colonies of all types per membrane. Sample quantities producing  MF counts
of 20 to 60 colonies of FC or FS are desired.
Step 2. Compute count per 100 mL, according to the general formul a:
Example 1: Counts with the acceptable limits:
Assume that filtration of volumes 75, 25, 10, 3, and 1 mL p roduced FC colony
counts of 210, 89, 35, 11, and 5, respectively. What is th e FC density for the
sample?
solution:
The MF with 35 FC colonies is the best MF for counting.
Thus, the FC density is
which will be recorded as 350 FC/100 mL.
It should be noted that an analyst would not count the coloni es on all five
filters. After inspection of five membrane filters, the analyst wou ld select the
MF(s) with 20 to 60 FC colonies and then limit the actual coun ting to such a
membrane. If there are acceptable counts on replicate filters, cou nt colonies
on each MF independently and determine final reporting densities.  Then
compute the arithmetic mean of these densities to obtain the final  recorded
density.
Example 2: For duplicate samples:
A duplicate filtration of 2.0 mL of water sample gives plate coun ts of 48 and
53 TC colonies. Compute the recorded value.
solution:
Step 1. Determine FS densities for two membranes independently, wit h the
general formula:

Step 2. Taking the average
The FS density for the water sample is reported as 2500 A/100 m L. Code A rep-
resents two or more filter counts within acceptable range and s ame dilution.
Note : Use two significant figures for all reported bacteria densiti es.
If more than one dilution is used, calculate the acceptable ra nge results to
final reporting densities separately; then average for final recor ded value.
Example 3: More than one dilution:
Volumes of 1.00, 0.30, 0.10, 0.03, and 0.01 mL generate TC c olony counts of
TNTC (too numerous to count), 210, 78, 33, and 6. What is the TC  density in
the water?
solution:
Step 1. In this case, only two volumes, 0.10 and 0.03 mL, p roduce TC colonies
in the acceptable limit. Calculate each MF density, separat ely,
and
Step 2. Compute the arithmetic mean of these two densities to obtai n the
final recorded TC density
which would be recorded as 94,000 TC per 100 mL C. Code C sta nds for the
calculated value from two or more filter colony counts within ac ceptable range
but different dilution.
If all MF colony counts are below the acceptable range, all coun ts should
be added together. Also, all mL volumes should be added together.
Example 4: All results below the desirable range:
Volumes of 25, 10, 4, and 1 mL produced FC colony counts of 18, 10, 3, and
0, respectively. Calculate the FC density for the water sample.TC

which would be recorded as 77 FC per 100 mL B, where code B repr esents
results based on colony counts outside the acceptable range.
If colony counts from all membranes are zero, there is no actual c alcula-
tion possible, even as an estimated result. If there had been one colony on the
membrane representing the largest filtration volume, the density  is esti-
mated from this filter only.
If all MF counts are above the acceptable limit, calculate th e density as
shown in Example 4.
Example 5: Filtration volumes 40, 15, 6, and 2 mL produced FC colony
counts of 1, 0, 0, and 0, respectively. Estimate the FC densi ty for the sample.
solution:
which would be recorded as 2.5 FC per 100 mL K1, where K1 mean s less than
2.5/100 mL using one filter to estimate the value.
Example 6: Membrane filtration volumes of 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mL produ ced
FC counts of 62, 106, 245, and TNTC, respectively. Compute the FC density.
solution:
which would be reported as 9200 FC per 100 mL B.
If bacteria colonies on the membrane are too numerous to count, use a
count of 200 colonies for the membrane filter with the smallest fil tration vol-
ume. The number at which a filter is considered TNTC is when th e colony
count exceeds 200 or when the colonies are too indistinct for accu rate counting.
Example 7: Given that filtration volumes of 2, 8, and 20 mL produce TC
colony counts of 244, TNTC, and TNTC, respectively, what is the TC density
in the sample?
solution:
Using the smallest filtration volume, 2 mL in this case, an d TC for 200 per
filter, gives a better representative value. The estimated TC densi ty is

If some MF colony counts are below and above the acceptable range a nd
there is a TNTC, use the useable counts and disregard any TNTCs  and its
filtration volume.
Example 8: Assume that filtration volumes 0.5, 2, 5, and 15 mL of a sa m-

solution:
The counts of 5 and TNTC with their volume are not included for
calculation.
Bacterial standards. Most regulatory agencies have stipulated stan-
dards based on the bacterial density for waters. For example, i n Illinois,
the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has promulgated th e
indicator bacteria standards for recreational-use waters as fol lows:
■A beach will be posted “Warning—Swim At Your Own Risk” when
bacterial counts exceed 1000 TC per 100 mL or 100 FC per 100 m L.
■A beach will be closed when bacterial densities exceed 5000 TC p er
100 mL or 500 FC per 100 mL in water samples collected on two c on-
secutive days.
The Illinois Pollution Control Board (IEPA, 1999) has adopted ru les
regarding FC limits for general-use water quality standards applicable
to lakes and streams. The rules of Section 302.209 are
a. During the months May through October, based on a minim um of five
samples taken over not more than a 30-day period, FCs (STORET num ber
31616) shall not exceed a geometric mean of 200 per100 mL, nor sh all
more than 10% of the samples during any 30-day period exceed 400  per
100 mL in protected waters. Protected waters are defined as waters  that,
due to natural characteristics, aesthetic value, or environm ental signifi-
cance, are deserving of protection from pathogenic organisms. Protec ted
waters must meet one or both of the following conditions:
(1) They presently support or have the physical characteristic s to support
primary contact.
(2) They flow through or adjacent to parks or residential areas. 5[reporting 1400 B]FC

Bacterial die-off in streams. There have been many studies on the die-
off rate of bacteria in streams. Most of the work suggests that C hick’s
law, one of the first mathematics formulations to describe die-off cu rves,
remains quite applicable for estimating the survival of path ogens and
nonpathogens of special interest in stream sanitation investig ations.
Chick’s law is

to bacterial population equivalents (BPE) in the manner proposed by
Kittrell and Furfari (1963). The following expressions were used for TC
and FC data:
(1.127)
(1.128)
Here the FC : TC ratio is assumed to be 0.964, as reported by Gel dreich
(1967).
Average stream flows and geometric means for each stream samplin g
station are used for BPE calculation. The relationship of BPE vers us
time of travel are plotted on semilog paper for both TC and FC.
Reasonably good straight lines of fit can be developed. The decay or
death rates for TC and FC can be estimated from the charts.
Example: TC density in the effluent is 9800 per 100 mL. Its densities a re
determined to be 5700, 2300, and 190 TC/100 mL, respectively,  after the time
of travel for 8, 24, and 60 h. Determine the die-off rate of TC in th e stream.

The macroinvertebrate biotic index (MBI) was developed to provide a
rapid stream-quality assessment. The MBI is calculated at each stream
station as a tool to assess the degree and extent of wastewater di s-
charge impacts. The MBI is an average of tolerance rating weig hted by
macroinvertebrate abundance, and is calculated from the formul a
(IEPA, 1987):
(1.129)
where ni/H11005number of individuals in each taxon i
ti/H11005tolerance rating assigned to that taxon i
N/H11005total number of individuals in the sediment sample
Most macroinvertebrate taxa known to occur in Illinois have b een
assigned a pollution tolerance rating, ranging from 0 to 11 based on lit-
erature and field studies. A 0 is assigned to taxa found only in unaltered
streams of high water quality, and an 11 is assigned to t axa known to
occur in severely polluted or disturbed streams. Intermediate r atings are
assigned to taxa that occur in streams with intermediate d egrees of
pollution or disturbance. Appendix A presents a list of these t olerance
ratings for each taxon.
Example: The numbers of macroinvertebrates in a river sediment sample
are 72, 29, 14, 14, 144, 445, 100, and 29 organisms/m2for Corbicula , Perlesta
placida , Stenonema , Caenis , Cheumatopsyche , Chironomidae , Stenelmis ,
and Tubificidae , respectively. The tolerance values for these organisms are,
respectively, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 7, and 10 (Appendix A). C ompute MBI for this
sample.

This chapter includes mainly lake morphometry, evaporation, a nd the
Clean Lakes Program (CLP). Since most lake management programs in
the United States are based on the CLP, the CLP is discussed in  detail.

1 Lakes and Impoundment Impairments
Lakes are extremely complex systems whose conditions are a function
of physical, chemical, and biological (the presence and predomi nance of

inherently function as traps or sinks for pollutants from tri butaries,
watersheds (drainage basins) or from atmospheric deposits and
precipitation.
Like streams, lakes are most often impaired by agricultural a ctiv-
ities (main sources in the United States), hydrologic/habitat  modifi-
cation (stream channelization), and point pollution sources. Thes e
activities contribute to nutrient and sediment loads, suspen ded solids,
and organic matter, and subsequently cause overgrowth of aqua tic
plants. The resulting decline in water quality limits recr eation,
impairs other beneficial uses, and shortens the expected life spa n of
a lake.
Common lake problems are eutrophication, siltation, shoreline ero-
sion, algal bloom, bad taste and/or odor, excessive growth of aq uatic
vegetation, toxic chemicals, and bacterial contamination. E utrophication,
or aging, the process by which a lake becomes enriched with n utrients,
is caused primarily by point and nonpoint pollution sources  from
human activities. Some man-made lakes and impoundments may
be untrophic from their birth. These problems impact esthetic a nd
practical uses of the lake. For example, the growth of planktonic  algae
in water supply impoundments may cause taste and odor probl ems,
shortened filter runs, increased chlorine demand, increased tur bidity,
and, for some facilities, increased trihalomethane precursors. Th e effects
ultimately lead to increased water treatment costs and, in s ome
instances, even to abandonment of the lake as a public water s upply
source.
Lakes and reservoirs are sensitive to pollution inputs because t hey
flush out their contents relatively slowly. Even under natura l condi-
tions, lakes and reservoirs undergo eutrophication, an aging process
caused by the inputs of organic matters and siltation.
2 Lake Morphometry
Lake morphometric data can be calculated from either a recent hy dro-
graphic map or a pre-impoundment topographic map of the basin . In
general, pre-impoundment maps may be obtainable from the design
engineering firm or local health or environmental government agenc ies.
If the map is too old and there is evidence of significant silta tion, sec-
tions of the lake, such as the upper end and coves with inflowi ng
streams, will need to be remapped.
In some cases, it is necessary to create a new lake map. The pr oce-
dures include the following:126 Chapter 21. The outline of the shoreline is drawn either from aerial photograp hs
or from United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topo-
graphic maps.
2. The water depth for transacts between known points on the shore-
line of the lake is measured by a graphing sonar.
3. The sonar strip chart of the transacts is interpreted and drawn on
to an enlarged copy of the lake outline.
4. Contours may be drawn by hand or with a computer on the m ap.
5. All maps are then either digitized or scanned and entered in to a geo-
graphic information system (GIS).
6. Coverages are then converted into sea level elevations by locatin g
the map on a 7.5-minute USGS topographic map and digitizin g ref-
erence points both on the map and on the quadrangle for known sea
level elevations.
7. Depths are assigned to the contour. The GIS gives the length of
each contour and areas between adjacent contour lines.
From this data, surface area, maximum depth of the lake, and shore-
line length can be computed. Lake volume ( V), shoreline development
index (SDI) or shoreline configuration ratio, and mean depth ( ) c an

3 Water Quality Models
Lakes and reservoirs are usually multipurpose, serving munic ipal and
industrial water supplies, recreation, hydroelectric power, fl ood control,
irrigation, drainage, and/or agriculture, due to the import ance of pro-
tecting these natural resources. Water quality involves the p hysical,
chemical, and biological integrity of water resources. Water q uality stan-
dards promulgated by the regulatory agencies define the water q uality
goals for protection of water resources in watershed management.
Modeling the water quality in lakes and reservoirs is very d ifferent
from that in rivers (Chapter 1) or estuaries. A variety of models are
based on some of physical, chemical, and biological parameters  and/or
combinations. Physical models deal with temperature, dissolved  oxygen
(DO), energy budget diffusion, mixing, vertical and horizontal aspects,
seasonal cycles, and meteorological data setting. Chemical mod els
involve mass balance and toxic substances. Biological models  deal with
nutrients and the food chain, biological growth, perdition, ox ygen bal-
ance, and tropical conditions, etc. 54.94 acres

and Reckhow (1983). Clark et al. (1977), Tchobanoglous and Schroeder
(1985), and James (1993) also present modeling water quality i n lakes
and reservoirs. However, most of those models are not used for lake
management practices.
For construction of a new lake or reservoir, it is required that the
owner submit the prediction of water quality in the future new lake
to the US Army Corps of Engineers. For example, Borah et al. (1997)
used the US Army Corps of Engineers’ HEC-5Q model (US Army Corps
of Engineers, 1986, 1989) for a central Illinois lake and two proposed
new lakes. The model was calibrated and verified on the existing  water
supply lake used monitored data in the draft years of 1986 an d 1988.
Eight water quality constituents were simulated. Calibrat ion, verifi-
cation, and predictions were made only for water temperature, DO ,
nitrate nitrogen, and phosphate phosphorus. The calibrated an d ver-
ified model was used to predict water surface elevations and con-
stituent concentrations in the three lakes, individually an d in
combination, with meteorological and estimated flow data for a 20 -
month period from May 1953 through December 1954, the most sever e
drought of record. The HEC-5Q model provided a useful tool in the
water quality evaluation of the three lakes. The HEC-5Q model was
developed by the Hydraulic Engineering Center in Davis, Califor nia,
for simulation of flood control and conservation systems with wat er
quality analysis. The details of these models are beyond the scop e of
this book.
The major portion of this chapter will cover evaporation and lak e
management programs in the Clean Lakes Program. Because these
subjects are general, they are not usually included in envir onmental
engineering textbooks.
4 Evaporation
Evaporation converts water in its liquid or solid state int o water vapor
which mixes with the atmosphere. The rate of evaporation is contr olled
by the availability of energy at the evaporating surface, and  the ease
with which water vapor can diffuse into the atmosphere.
Shuttleworth (1993) presented a detailed description with modeli ng
of evaporation and transpiration from soil surfaces and crops. Modelings
include fundamental and empirical equations. Measurements of ev ap-
oration and methods for estimating evaporation are also given.
Evaporation of water from a lake surface uses energy provided by t he
sun to heat the water. The rate of evaporation is controlled prima rily
by the water temperature, air temperature, and the level of moist ure
saturation in the air. Knowledge of evaporative processes is imp ortantLakes and Reservoirs 131in understanding how water losses through evaporation from a l ake or
reservoir are determined. Evaporation increases the storage requir e-
ment and decreases the yield of lakes and reservoirs.
Determination of evaporation from a lake surface can be modeled by
the water budget method, the mass transfer method, and the energ y
budget method (Robert and Stall, 1967). Many empirical equat ions have
been proposed elsewhere (Fair et al., 1966, Linsley and Franzinni, 1964).
4.1 Water budget method
The water budget method for lake evaporation depends on an accurat e
measurement of the inflow and outflow of the lake. The simple mathe-
matical calculation shows that the change in storage equal s the input
minus output. It is expressed as
(2.8)
where /H9004S/H11005change in lake storage, mm (or in)
P/H11005precipitation, mm
R /H11005surface runoff or inflow, mm

GO/H11005groundwater outflow, mm
E/H11005evaporation, mm
T /H11005transpiration, mm
O/H11005surface water release, mm
For the case of a lake with little vegetation and negligible grou ndwater
inflow and outflow, lake evaporation can be estimated by
(2.9)
The water budget method has been used successfully to estimate la ke
evaporation in some areas.
4.2 Energy budget method
The principal elements in energy budget of the lake evaporation ar e
shown in Fig. 2.1. The law of conservation of energy suggests tha t the
total energy reaching the lake must be equal to the total energy  leav-
ing the lake plus the increase in internal energy of the lake. The energy
budget in Fig. 2.1 can be expressed as (US Geological Survey, 1954)
(2.10) Qe5Qs2Qr2Qb2Qh2Qu6QvE5P1R2O6/H9004S/H9004S5P1R1GI2GO2E2T2O132 Chapter 2where Qe/H11005energy available for evaporation

Qh/H11005energy transferred from the lake to the atmosphere
Q/H9258/H11005increase in energy stored in the lake
Qv/H11005energy transferred into or from the lake bed
The energy budget shown in Fig. 2.1 can be applied to evaporati on
from a class A pan (illustrated in Fig. 2.2). The pan energy b udget
(Fig. 2.2) contains the same elements as the lake budget (Fig. 2. 1) except
that heat is lost through the side and the bottom of the pan. Equation (2.10)
is also applied to pan energy budget calculation.
A pioneering and comprehensive research project centered on tech-
niques for measuring evaporation was conducted at Lake Hefner,
Oklahoma, in 1950–51 with the cooperation of five federal agencies  (US
Geological Survey, 1954). The energy budget data from a Weather
Bureau class A evaporation pan was used to evaluate the study . Growing
out of that project was the US Weather Bureau nomograph, a four-
gradient diagram (Fig. 2.3) for general use for lake evaporation (K ohler
et al., 1959). Subsequently, the formula for a mathematical soluti on
of the nomograph was adapted from computer use (Lamoreux, 1962).Lakes and Reservoirs 133
Figure 2.1 Elements of energy budget method for determining
lake evaporation ( Robert and Stall, 1967) .134 Chapter 2
Figure 2.2 Energy budget method applied to class A
pan ( Robert and Stall, 1967) .
Figure 2.3 Lake evaporation nomograph ( Kohler et al., 1959) .These procedures allow lake and pan evaporation to be computed from
four items of climate data, i.e. air temperature, dew point temp erature,
wind movement, and solar radiation. Since long-term climate d ata are
mostly available, these techniques permit extended and refined ev apo-
ration determination.
Although the nomograph (Fig. 2.3) was developed for the use with
daily values, it is also usable with monthly average valu es and gives rea-
sonably reliable results with annual average values. The four-q uadrant
diagram can be used to determine a lake’s evaporation rate as illustrated
in Fig. 2.3. For example, at the upper left quadrant, a horizon tal line
passes from the mean daily air temperature 81°F to the first in tersec-
tion at the solar radiation 600-langley curve, and projects toward the
right to intersection of the 55°F mean daily dew point curve. A t this stop,
a vertical line runs downward to the line of 120-miles per day  wind
movement from where a horizontal line projects toward to the left to
intersect a vertical line from the first intersection. The averag e daily lake
evaporation, 0.27/in, is read at this point. 
The following two equations for evaporation can be computed by com-
puter (Lamoreux, 1962) as exemplified by the Weather Bureau compu-
tational procedures for the United States.
For pan evaporation:
Ep/H11005{exp[( Ta/H11002212)(0.1024 /H110020.01066 ln R)]/H110020.0001

Pan evaporation is used widely to estimate lake evaporation in t he
United States. The lake evaporation ELis usually computed for yearlyLakes and Reservoirs 135time periods. Its relationship with the pan evaporation Epcan be
expressed as
(2.13)
where pcis the pan coefficient. The pan coefficient on an annual basis
has been reported as 0.65 to 0.82 by Kohler et al. (1955).
Robert and Stall (1967) used Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10) for 17 stat ions in and
near Illinois over the May–October season for a 16-year period to d evelop
the general magnitudes and variability of lake evaporation in  Illinois.
Evaporation loss is a major factor in the net yield of a lake or  reser-
voir. The net evaporation loss from a lake is the difference between a
maximum expected gross lake evaporation and the minimum expect ed
precipitation on the lake surface for various recurrence interval s and for
critical periods having various durations. This approach assumes max-
imum evaporation and minimum precipitation would occur sim ultane-
ously. The following example illustrates the calculation of net d raft rate
for a drought recurrence interval of 40 years.
Example: Calculate the net yield or net draft for the 40-year recurrence
interval for a reservoir (333 acres, 135 ha). Given: drainage area /H11005 15.7 miles2,

5 The Clean Lakes Program
In the 1960s, many municipal wastewater treatment plants  were con-
structed or upgraded (point source pollution control) in the Uni ted
States. However, the nation’s water quality in lakes and reser voirs has
not been improved due to nonpoint sources of pollution. In 1972, t he
US Congress amended Section 314 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act (Public Law 92-500) to control the nation’s pollution
sources and to restore its freshwater lakes. In 1977, the Clean  Lakes
Program (CLP) was established pursuant to Section 314 of the Clean
Water Act. Under the CLP, publicly owned lakes can apply a nd receive
financial assistance from the US Environmental Protection Agenc y
(US EPA) to conduct diagnostic studies of the lakes and to devel op fea-
sible pollution control measures and water quality enhancement  tech-
niques for lakes. This is the so-called Phase 1 diagnostic/feasib ility
(D/F) study.Lakes and Reservoirs 137The objectives of the CLP are to (US EPA, 1980):
1. classify publicly owned freshwater lakes according to troph ic
conditions;
2. conduct diagnostic studies of specific publicly owned lakes , and
develop feasible pollution control and restoration programs for them ;
and
3. implement lake restoration and pollution control projects.
5.1 Types of funds
The CLP operates through four types of financial assistance by cooper -
ative agreements. They are
State lake classification survey
Phase 1—diagnostic/feasibility study
Phase 2—implementation
Phase 3—post-restoration monitoring
Funding is typically provided yearly for the state lake clas sification
survey, but on a long-term basis for Phases 1, 2, and 3. Phas e 1 funds
are used to investigate the existing or potential causes of decli ne in the
water quality of a publicly owned lake; to evaluate possible s olutions to
existing or anticipated pollution problems; and to develop and  recom-
mend the most “feasible” courses of action to restore or preserve the
quality of the lake. Activities typically associated with s ample collection,
sample analyses, purchase of needed equipment, information gather ing,
and report development are eligible for reimbursement. During Phas e
1, total project costs cannot exceed $100,000. Fifty percent of t his fund-
ing will come from the CLP, while the rest must come from nonfederal
or local sources.
5.2 Eligibility for ﬁnancial assistance
Only states are eligible for CLP financial assitance, and cooper ative
agreements will be awarded to state agencies. A state may in t urn
make funds available to a substate agency or agencies for all or any
portion of a specific project. The D/F study is generally carried  out by
a contracted organization, such as research institutes or con sulting
engineers.
For nearly two decades, 46% of the US lake acres were assessed for
their water qualities and impairments (US EPA, 1994). Sin ce the
early 1990s, federal funds for CLP were terminated due to the budget
cuts. Some states, such as Illinois, continued the CLP with state
funds.138 Chapter 25.3 State lake classiﬁcation survey
In general, most states use state lake classification survey funding to
operate three types of lake survey activities. These include the vol un-
teer lake monitoring program (VLMP), the ambient lake monitoring
program (ALMP), and lake water quality assessment (LWQA) grant.  All
three programs are partially supported by a Section 314 Federa l CLP
LWQA grant. State funds matched equally with federal grant funds are
used to improve the quantity and quality of lake information r eported
in the annual 305(b) report to the US Congress.
Volunteer lake monitoring program. The VLMP is a statewide cooperative
program which volunteers to monitor lake conditions twice a mon th
from May through October and transmit the collected data to t he state
agency (EPA or similar agency) for analysis and report prepara tion. In
Illinois, the VLMP was initiated by Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency (IEPA) in 1981 (IEPA, 1984). The volunteers can be person nel
employed by the lake owner (a water treatment plant, Department of
Conservation or other state agency, city, lake association, in dustry, etc.),
or they can be local citizens. (The lakes monitored are not limited  to pub-
licly owned lakes.) Volunteers must have a boat and an anchor  in order
to perform the sampling. Volunteers receive a report prepared by t he
state EPA, which evaluates their sampling results.
Volunteers measure Secchi disc transparencies and total depth s at
three sites in the lake. For reservoirs, site 1 is generally loca ted at the
deepest spot (near the dam); site 2 is at midlake or in a major  arm; and
site 3 is in the headwater, a major arm, or the tributary confluence. The
data are recorded on standard forms. In addition, the volunteer s also
complete a field observation form each time the lake is sampled an d
record the number that best describes lake conditions during sampling
for each site on the lake. Observations include color of the water,  the
amount of sediment suspended in the water, visible suspended al gae,
submerged or floating aquatic weeds, weeds near the shore, miscel la-
neous substances, odors, cloudiness, precipitation, waves, ai r tempera-
ture at the lake, lake water levels, recreational usage, and l ake
management done since the last sampling (IEPA, 1983).
Ambient lake monitoring program. The ALMP is also a statewide regular
water quality monitoring program. Water quality samples a re collected
and analyzed annually by IEPA personnel on selected lakes throu ghout
the state. The major objectives of the ALMP are to (IEPA, 1992):

The ALMP provides a much more comprehensive set of chemical analy-
ses on the collected water samples than does the VLMP.
In Illinois, the ALMP was initiated in 1977. Water samples  are ana-
lyzed for temperature, dissolved oxygen, Secchi disc transparenc y, alka-
linity, conductivity, turbidity, total and volatile sus pended solids,
dissolved and total phosphorus, and nitrogen (ammonia, nitri te/nitrate,
and total kjeldahl). In addition, 9 metals and 11 organic s analyses are
performed on water and sediment samples.
Lake water quality assessment. The LWQA grant is focused on non-
routinely monitored lakes to gather basic data on in-lake water  quality
and sediment quality. This information increases the efficiency,  effec-
tiveness, and quality of the state EPA’s lake data managemen t and
305(b) report.
LWQA fieldwork involves two major tasks: namely, collection of lak e
assessment information and in-lake water and sediment samplin g.
Lake assessment information collected includes lake identification
and location, morphometric data, public access, designated uses and
impairments, lake and shoreline usages, watershed drainage a rea usage,
water quality and problems, status of fisheries, causes and sources of
impairment (if any), past lake protection and management techn iques,
and lake maps.
In general, only one sampling trip per lake is made in order to
evaluate a maximum number of lakes with the limited resources.  The
water and sediment samples are collected in summer by contrac ted
agencies and analyzed by the state EPA laboratory. Chemical a nalyses
for water and sediment samples are the same as in the ALMP.
5.4 Phase 1: Diagnostic/feasibility study
A diagnostic/feasibility study is a two-part study to determ ine a lake’s cur-
rent condition and to develop plans for its restora tion and management.
Protocol for the D/F study of a lake (Lin, 1994) is a digest from th e CLP
Guidance Manual (US EPA, 1980).140 Chapter 2For a Phase 1 D/F study, the following activities should be car ried out
and completed within 3 years (US EPA, 1980):
1. Development of a detailed work plan
2. Study of the natural characteristics of the lake and water shed
3. Study of social, economic, and recreational characteristics  of the
lake and watershed
4. Lake monitoring
5. Watershed monitoring
6. Data analysis
7. Development and evaluation of restoration alternatives
8. Selection and further development of watershed management
plans
9. Projection of benefits
10. Environmental evaluation
11. Public participation
12. Public hearings (when appropriate)
13. Report production
Activities 1 through 6 are part of the diagnostic study; t he other activ-
ities pertain to the feasibility study.
Diagnostic study. The diagnostic study is devoted to data gathering
and analysis. It involves collecting sufficient limnological , morphologi-
cal, demographic, and socioeconomic information about the lake a nd its
watershed.
The study of lake and watershed natural characteristics, an d most of
the social, economic, and recreational information of the lake regi on
can often be accomplished by obtaining and analyzing secondar y data,
i.e. data already available from other sources.
Baseline limnological data include a review of historical dat a and
1 year of current limnological data. Lake monitoring is expensi ve.
Monthly and bimonthly samples are required for assessing phy sical
and chemical characteristics. At least three sites are chos en for each
lake, as mentioned in the discussion of the ALMP (Section 5.3). In
addition, biological parameters, such as chlorophylls, phytopla nkton,
zooplankton, aquatic macrophytes, indicator bacteria, benthi c macroin-
vertebrate, and fish surveys, must be assessed at different spec ified
frequencies. At least one surficial and/or core sediment sample a ndLakes and Reservoirs 141water sample at each site must be collected for heavy metals an d organic
compounds analyses. Water quality analyses of tributaries a nd ground-
water may also be included, depending on each lake’s situati on.
Watershed monitoring is done by land-use stream monitoring man u-
ally or automatically to determine the nutrient, sediment, an d hydraulic
budget for a lake.
Primary and secondary data collected during the diagnostic study
are analyzed to provide the basic information for the feasibility portion
of the Phase 1 study. Data analysis involves:
1. inventory of point source pollutant discharges;
2. watershed land use and nonpoint nutrient/solids loading;
3. analyses of lake data—water and sediment quality;
4. analyses of stream and groundwater data;
5. calculating the hydrologic budget of the watershed and lak e;
6. calculating the nutrient budget of the lake;
7. assessing biological resources and ecological relationships—l ake
fauna, terrestrial vegetation, and animal life;
8. determining the loading reductions necessary to achieve water  qual-
ity objectives.
The following analyses of lake data are typically required: (1) i dentifi-
cation of the limiting nutrient based on the ratio of total nit rogen to total
phosphorus; (2) determination of the trophic state index based on total
phosphorus, chlorophyll a, Secchi depth, and primary productivity;
(3) calculation of the fecal coliform to fecal streptococcus ratios t o iden-
tify causes of pollution in the watershed; and (4) evaluation of t he sed-
iment quality for the purpose of dredging operations.
A description of the biological resources and ecological relationsh ips
is included in the diagnostic study based on information ga thered from
secondary sources. This description generally covers lake flora (t erres-
trial vegetation, such as forest, prairie, and marsh) and fa una (mam-
mals, reptiles and amphibians, and birds).
Feasibility study. The feasibility study involves developing alternative
management programs based on the results of the diagnostic stu dy.
First, existing lake quality problems and their causes shou ld be identi-
fied and analyzed. Problems include turbid water, eroding shorel ines,
sedimentation and shallow water depths, low water levels, low dissolved
oxygen levels, excessive nutrients, algal bloom, unbalanced aq uatic veg-
etative growth (excessive growth of macrophytes), nonnative exotic
species, degraded or unbalanced fishery and aquatic communit ies, bad142 Chapter 2taste and odor, acidity, toxic chemicals, agricultural r unoff, bacterial
contamination, poor lake esthetics, user conflicts, and negati ve human
impacts.
Once the lake problems have been defined, a preliminary list of c or-
rective alternatives needs to be established and discussed. Com monly
adopted pollution control and lake restoration techniques can b e found
in the literature (US EPA, 1980, 1990). The corrective measures  include
in-lake restoration and/or best management practices in the wa tershed.
Each alternative must be evaluated in terms of cost; reliabil ity; techni-
cal feasibility; energy consumption; and social, economic, an d environ-
mental impacts. For each feasible alternative, a detailed descr iption of
measures to be taken, a quantitative analysis of pollution con trol effec-
tiveness, and expected lake water quality improvement must be
provided.
There are usually many good methods of achieving specific objectiv es
or benefits. The Phase 1 report should document the various alterna -
tives by describing their relative strengths and weaknesses and show-
ing how the one chosen is superior. Final selection should be dis cussed
in a public meeting.
Once an alternative has been selected, work can proceed on develop-
ing other program details required as part of Phase 1. These inc lude
developing the Phase 2 monitoring program, schedule and budget,  and
source of nonfederal funds; defining the relationship of Phase 2 plan s
to other programs; developing an operation and maintenance plan ; and
obtaining required permits. In other words, the feasibility s tudy portion
of the Phase 1 report actually constitutes the proposal for Phase 2  study.
The report also must include the projection of the project benefits, envi-
ronmental evaluations, and public participation.
Final report. The final report will have to follow strictly the format and
protocol stipulated in the Clean Lakes Program Guidance Manual.

5.5 Phase 2: Implementation
A Phase 1 D/F study identifies the major problems in a lake and  rec-
ommends a management plan. Under the CLP, if funds are availa ble,
the plan can then be implemented and intensive monitoring of th e lake
and tributaries conducted either by the state EPA or a contra cted
agency.
The physical, chemical, and biological parameters monitored a nd the
frequencies of monitoring are similar to those for Phase 1 D/F study  (or
more specific, depending on the objectives). One year of water quali ty
monitoring is required for post-implementation study. Non-federal c ost-
share (50%) funds are usually provided by state and local lan downers.
A comprehensive monitoring program should be conducted to obtain
post-implementation data for comparison with pre-implementation
(Phase 1) data.
The implementation program may include keeping point- and
nonpoint-source pollutants from entering a lake, implementing in -lake
restoration measures to improve lake water quality, a monitorin g
program, environmental impact and cost evaluation, and pub lic
participation.
5.6 Phase 3: Post-restoration monitoring
The CLP has recently begun setting up a system for managing an d
evaluating lake project data, designed to derive benefit from pas t proj-
ects. Quantitative scientific data on long-term project effectiven ess
will become increasingly available through post-restoration mon itor-
ing studies being conducted under Phase 3 CLP grants institu ted in
1989.
Several years after Phase 2 implementation, a lake may be selected
for Phase 3 post-restoration monitoring with matching funds. For Phase 3
monitoring, the water quality parameters monitored and the freq uency
of sampling in the lake and tributaries are similar to tha t for Phases 1
and 2. However, the period of monitoring for Phase 3 is generally 3
years with a total project period of 4 to 5 years. The purpose is  to build
upon an extensive database of information gathered under Phases 1 and
2 investigations.
Data gathered from Phase 1 are compared with Phases 2 and 3 da ta-
bases to determine the long-term effectiveness of watershed protectionLakes and Reservoirs 145measures and in-lake management techniques implemented during and
since Phase 2 completion.
5.7 Watershed protection approach
The watershed protection approach (WPA) is an integrated strategy  for
more effective restoration and protection of aquatic ecosystems and
human health; i.e. drinking water supplies and fish consu mption
(US EPA, 1993). The WPA focuses on hydrologically defined drainage
basins (“watersheds”) rather than on areas arbitrarily defin ed by polit-
ical boundaries. Local decisions on the scale of geographic unit s consider
many factors including the ecological structure of the basin,  the hydro-
logic factors of groundwaters, the economic lake uses, the type an d scope
of pollution problems, and the level of resources available for protec tion
and restoration projects (US EPA, 1991, 1993).
The WPA has three major principles (US EPA, 1991, 1993):
1. Problem identification—identify the primary risk to human hea lth
and ecosystem within the watershed;
2. Stakeholder involvement—involve all parties most likely to be c on-
cerned or most able to take action for solution;
3. Integrated actions—take corrective actions in a manner that  pro-
vides solutions and evaluates results.
The WPA is not a new program, and any watershed planning is not
mandated by federal law. It is a flexible framework to achieve m aximum
efficiency and effect by collaborative activities. Everyone—individ ual cit-
izens, the public and private sectors—can benefit from a WPA.
The US EPA’s goal for the WPA is to maintain and improve the hea lth
and integrity of aquatic ecosystems using comprehensive approa ches
that focus resources on the major problems facing these systems w ithin
the watershed (US EPA, 1993).
For more than two decades, the CLP has emphasized using the water-
shed protection approach. A long-standing program policy gives  greater
consideration to applicants who propose restoration and protecti on tech-
niques that control pollutants at the source through watersh ed-wide
management rather than dealing with symptoms in the lake.
5.8 In-lake monitoring
In Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, in-lake water quality param eters that need
to be monitored generally include water temperature, dissolved oxy gen,
turbidity, Secchi transparency, solids (total suspended an d volatile),
conductivity, pH, alkalinity, nitrogen (ammonia, nitrite/n itrate, and
total kjeldahl), phosphorus (total and dissolved), total and fec al coliforms,146 Chapter 2fecal streptococci, algae, macrophytes, and macroinvertebrates.  Except
for the last two parameters, samples are collected bimonthly (Ap ril to
October) and monthly (other months) for at least 1 year. At a mi nimum,
three stations (at the deepest, the middle, and upper locations of the
lake) are generally monitored (Lin et al., 1996, 1998).
Lake water quality standards and criteria. The comprehensive information
and data collected during Phase 1, 2, or 3 study are evalua ted with
state water quality standards and state lake assessment c riteria. Most
states in the United States have similar state standards and assessment
criteria. For example, Illinois generally uses the water quali ty stan-
dards applied to lake water listed in Table 2.1; and Illi nois EPA’s lake
assessment criteria are presented in Table 2.2.
The data obtained from Phase 1, 2, and 3 of the study can be pl otted
from temporal variations for each water quality parameter, as shown in
the example given in Fig. 2.4. Similarly, the historical d ata also can be
plotted in the same manner for comparison purposes.
Indicator bacteria (total and fecal coliforms, and fecal strept ococcus)
densities in lakes and reservoirs should be evaluated in the s ame
manner as that given for rivers and streams in Chapter 1. The density
and moving geometric mean of FC are usually stipulated by the state’sLakes and Reservoirs 147

Temperature and dissolved oxygen. Water temperature and dissolved
oxygen in lake waters are usually measured at 1 ft (30 cm) an d 2 ft (60 cm)
intervals. The obtained data are used to calculate values of th e percent148 Chapter 2

mentous and attached ones. Algae are generally classified into four
major types: blue-greens, greens, diatoms, and flagellates. Throu gh
their photosynthesis processes, algae use energy from sunlight a nd
carbon dioxide from bicarbonate sources, converting it to organi c matter
and oxygen (Fig. 2.7). The removal of carbon dioxide from the water
results in an increase in pH and a decrease in alkalinity.  Algae are
important sources of dissolved oxygen in water. Phytoplanktonic algae
form at the base of the aquatic food web and provide the primary source
of food for fish and other aquatic insects and animals.
Excessive growth (blooms) of algae may cause problems such as ba d
taste and odor, increased color and turbidity, decreased filter  run at a
water treatment plant, unsightly surface scums and estheti c problems,
and even oxygen depletion after die-off. Blue-green algae tend to cause
the worst problems. To prevent such proliferation (upset the ecolog ical
balance), lake and watershed managers often try to reduce the am ounts
of nutrients entering lake waters, which act like fertilizers i n promot-
ing algal growth. Copper sulfate is frequently used for algal control, and
sometimes it is applied on a routine basis during summer mon ths,
whether or not it is actually needed. One should try to identi fy theLakes and Reservoirs 151

selectively rather than on a shot-in-the-dark basis.
Copper sulfate (CuSO4 · 5H2O) was applied in an Illinois impound-
ment at an average rate of 22 pounds per acre (lb/acre); in some lakes,
as much as 80 lb/acre was used (Illinois State Water Surv ey, 1989).
Frequently, much more copper sulfate is applied than necessary.
Researchers have shown that 5.4 lb of copper sulfate per acre of l ake
surface (6.0 kg/ha) is sufficient to control problem-causing blu e-green
algae in waters with high alkalinity ( /H1102240 mg/L as CaCO3). The amount
is equivalent to the rate of 1 mg/L of copper sulfate for the top 2 ft
(60 cm) of the lake surface (Illinois State Water Survey, 1989).  The lit-
erature suggests that a concentration of 0.05 to 0.10 mg/L as  Cu2/H11001is
effective in controlling blue-green algae in pure cultures under l abo-
ratory conditions.

sulfate in water?

Example 2: Since 0.05 to 0.10 mg/L of Cu2/H11001is needed to control blue-green
algae, what is the theoretical concentration expressed as CuSO4 /H11080 5H2O?
solution:
Answer: This is equivalent to 0.20 to 0.4 mg/L as CuSO4 /H11080 5H2O.
Note: For field application, however, a concentration of 1.0mg/L as

Secchi disc transparency. The Secchi disc is named after its Italian
inventor Pietro Angelo Secchi, and is a black and white round  plate
used to measure water clarity. Values of Secchi disc transpa rency are
used to classify a lake’s trophic state.
Secchi disc visibility is a measure of a lake’s water tran sparency,
which suggests the depth of light penetration into a body of wa ter (its
ability to allow sunlight to penetrate). Even though Secchi d isc trans-
parency is not an actual quantitative indication of light  transmission,
it provides an index for comparing similar bodies of water or t he same
body of water at different times. Since changes in water color an d tur-
bidity in deep lakes are generally caused by aquatic flora a nd fauna,
transparency is related to these entities. The euphotic zone or regi on of
a lake where enough sunlight penetrates to allow photosynthetic pro-
duction of oxygen by algae and aquatic plants is taken as two to three
times the Secchi disc depth (US EPA, 1980).
Suspended algae, microscopic aquatic animals, suspended ma tter
(silt, clay, and organic matter), and water color are factors  that inter-
fere with light penetration into the water column and reduce Secchi
disc transparency. Combined with other field observations, Sec chi discRate5W

Phosphorus. The term total phosphorus (TP) represents all forms of phos-
phorus in water, both particulate and dissolved forms, and includes three
chemical types: reactive, acid-hydrolyzed, and organic. Diss olved phos-
phorus (DP) is the soluble form of TP (filterable through a 0.45- /H9262m filter).
Phosphorus as phosphate may occur in surface water or groundwa -
ter as a result of leaching from minerals or ores, natural proc esses of
degradation, or agricultural drainage. Phosphorus is an ess ential nutri-
ent for plant and animal growth and, like nitrogen, it pas ses through
cycles of decomposition and photosynthesis.
Because phosphorus is essential to the plant growth process, i t has
become the focus of attention in the entire eutrophication issue. Wi th
phosphorus being singled out as probably the most limiting nutrient and
the one most easily controlled by removal techniques, various fac ets of
phosphorus chemistry and biology have been extensively studied in the
natural environment. Any condition which approaches or exceeds  the
limits of tolerance is said to be a limiting condition or a l imiting factor.
In any ecosystem, the two aspects of interest for phosphorus dyna m-
ics are phosphorus concentration and phophorus flux (concentrat ion /H11003
flow rate) as functions of time and distance. The concentration al one
indicates the possible limitation that this nutrient can place on vege-
tative growth in the water. Phosphorus flux is a measure of the phos-
phorus transport rate at any point in flowing water.
Unlike nitrate-nitrogen, phosphorus applied to the land as a fertilizer
is held tightly to the soil. Most of the phosphorus carried in to streams and
lakes from runoff over cropland will be in the particulate form a dsorbed
to soil particles. On the other hand, the major portion of phosp hate-
phosphorus emitted from municipal sewer systems is in a diss olved form.
This is also true of phosphorus generated from anaerobic degradati on of
organic matter in the lake bottom. Consequently, the form of phosp horus,
namely, particulate or dissolved, is indicative of its sourc e to a certain
extent. Other sources of dissolved phosphorus in the lake water m ay
include the decomposition of aquatic plants and animals. Di ssolved phos-
phorus is readily available for algae and macrophyte growth.  However,
the DP concentration can vary widely over short periods of time a s plants
take up and release this nutrient. Therefore, TP in lake water is the more
commonly used indicator of a lake’s nutrient status.
From his experience with Wisconsin lakes, Sawyer (1952) conclud ed
that aquatic blooms are likely to develop in lakes during su mmer months
when concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and inorganic phosph orus154 Chapter 2exceed 0.3 and 0.01mg/L, respectively. These critical levels for nitrogen
and phosphorus concentrations have been accepted and widely qu oted
in scientific literature.
To prevent biological nuisance, the IEPA (1990) stipulates,
“Phosphorus as P shall not exceed a concentration of 0.05 mg/L in  any
reservoir or lake with a surface area of 8.1 ha (20 acres) or more or in
any stream at the point where it enters any reservoir or lake.”
Chlorophyll. All green plants contain chlorophyll a, which constitutes
approximately 1% to 2% of the dry weight of planktonic algae (APHA
et al., 1992). Other pigments that occur in phytoplankton incl ude chloro-
phyll b and c, xanthophylls, phycobilius, and carotenes. The important
chlorophyll degration products in water are the chlorophyllid es, pheophor-
bides, and pheophytines. The concentration of photosynthetic pigm ents
is used extensively to estimate phytoplanktonic biomass. The pr esence or
absence of the various photosynthetic pigments is used, among ot her fea-
tures, to identify the major algal groups present in the water  body.
Chlorophyll a is a primary photosynthetic pigment in all oxygen-
evolving photosynthetic organisms. Extraction and quantific ation of
chlorophyll acan be used to estimate biomass or the standing crop of
planktonic algae present in a body of water. Other algae pigm ents, par-
ticularly chlorophyll band c, can give information on the type of algae
present. Blue-green algae (Cyanophyta) contain only chlorophyll a,
while both the green algae (Chlorophyta) and the euglenoids
(Euglenophyta) contain chlorophyll aand c. Chlorophyll aand care
also present in the diatoms, yellow-green and yellow-brown algae
(Chrysophyta), as well as dinoflagellates (Pyrrhophyta). These acc essory
pigments can be used to identify the types of algae present in a  lake.
Pheophytin aresults from the breakdown of chlorophyll a, and a large
amount indicates a stressed algal population or a recent alg al die-off.
Because direct microscopic examination of water samples is used  to
identify and enumerate the type and concentrations of algae presen t in
the water samples, the indirect method (chlorophyll analyses) of making
such assessments may not be employed.
Nutrient in lake water will impact the aquatic community  in the sur-
face water during summer. Dillon and Rigler (1974) used data  from
North American lakes to drive the relationship between spring phos-
phorus and chlorophyll a concentration in summer as follows:

5.9 Trophic state index
Eutrophication is a normal process that affects every body of wa ter
from its time of formation (Walker, 1981a, 1981b). As a lake ag es, the
degree of enrichment from nutrient materials increases. In general , the
lake traps a portion of the nutrients originating in the sur rounding
drainage basin. Precipitation, dry fallout, and groundwater  inflow are
the other contributing sources.
A wide variety of indices of lake trophic conditions have been prop osed
in the literature. These indices have been based on Secchi disc trans-
parency; nutrient concentrations; hypolimnetic oxygen depletion ; and
biological parameters, including chlorophyll a, species abundance, and
diversity. In its Clean Lake Program Guidance Manual , the US EPA
(1980) suggests the use of four parameters as trophic indicators : Secchi
disc transparency, chlorophyll a,surface water total phosphorus, and
total organic carbon.
In addition, the lake trophic state index (TSI) developed by Car lson
(1977) on the basis of Secchi disc transparency, chlorophyll a, and sur-
face water total phosphorus can be used to calculate a lake’s trophic
state. The TSI can be calculated from Secchi disc transparenc y (SD) in
meters (m), chlorophyll a(CHL) in micrograms per liter ( /H9262g/L), and
total phosphorus (TP) in /H9262g/L as follows:
on the basis of SD, TSI /H1100560 /H1100214.4 ln (SD) (2.15)
on the basis of CHL, TSI /H11005 9.81 ln (CHL) /H1100130.6 (2.16)
on the basis of TP, TSI /H1100514.42 ln (TP) /H110014.15 (2.17)156 Chapter 2The index is based on the amount of algal biomass in surface wa ter, using
a scale of 0 to 100. Each increment of 10 in the TSI represents a theoret-
ical doubling of biomass in the lake. The advantage s and disadvantages
of using the TSI were discussed by Hudson et al. (1992). The accuracy
of Carlson’s index is often diminished by water coloration or su spended
solids other than algae. Applying TSI classification to lak es that are dom-
inated by rooted aquatic plants may indicate less eutrophic ation than
actually exists.
Lakes are generally classified by limnologists into one of three tr ophic
states: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, or eutrophic (Table 2.3). Oli gotrophic
lakes are known for their clean and cold waters and lack of aq uatic weeds
or algae, due to low nutrient levels. There are few oligotrophic lak es in the
Midwest. At the other extreme, eutrophic lakes are high in nut rient
levels and are likely to be very productive in terms of weed growt h and
algal blooms. Eutrophic lakes can support large fish popula tions, but the
fish tend to be rougher species that can better tolerate depleted l evels of
DO. Mesotrophic lakes are in an intermediate stage between oligot rophic
and eutrophic. The great majority of Midwestern lakes are eutroph ic.
A hypereutrophic lake is one that has undergone extreme eutrophica tion
to the point of having developed undesirable esthetic qualities (e. g. odors,
algal mats, and fish kills) and water-use limitations (e.g.  extremely dense
growths of vegetation). The natural aging process causes all la kes to
progress to the eutrophic condition over time, but this eutrophi cation
process can be accelerated by certain land uses in the contri buting water-
shed (e.g. agricultural activities, application of lawn fert ilizers, and ero-
sion from construction sites, unprotected areas, and streams). Given
enough time, a lake will grow shallower and will eventually fill in with
trapped sediments and decayed organic matter, such that it  becomes a
shallow marsh or emergent wetland.
Example 1: Lake monitoring data shows that the Secchi disc transparenc y
is 77 in; total phosphorus, 31 /H9262g/L; and chlorophyll a3.4 /H9262g/L. Calculate TSI

TSI values are included in Table 2.4.

b. Classify trophic state based on the average TSI and the cri teria listed in
Table 2.3.
c. Calculate overall mean TSI for the lake.
d. Determine overall trophic state. For this example, the lake is  classified as
eutrophic . The classifications are slightly different if based on each of t he
three water quality parameters.
5.10 Lake use support analysis
Deﬁnition. An analysis of a lake’s use support can be carried out employ -
ing a methodology (similar to Federal and other states) developed by  the158 Chapter 2IEPA (1994). The degree of use support identified for each designated
use indicates the ability of the lake to (1) support a variety of high-
quality recreational activities, such as boating, sport fi shing, swim-
ming, and esthetic enjoyment; (2) support healthy aquatic li fe and sport
fish populations; and (3) provide adequate, long-term quality a nd quan-
tity of water for public or industrial water supply (if appl icable).
Determination of a lake’s use support is based upon the state’s  water
quality standards as described in Subtitle C of Title 35 of the State of
Illinois Administrative Code (IEPA, 1990). Each of four establ ished use-
designation categories (including general use, public and food process-
ing water supply, Lake Michigan, and secondary contact an d indigenous
aquatic life) has a specific set of water quality standards.
For the lake uses assessment, the general use standards—primari ly
the 0.05 mg/L TP standard—should be used. The TP standard has b een
established for the protection of aquatic life, primary-contact (e. g. swim-
ming), fish consumption, and secondary-contact (e.g. boating) r ecre-
ation, agriculture, and industrial uses. In addition, l ake use support is
based in part on the amount of sediment, macrophytes, and alg ae in theLakes and Reservoirs 159

SOURCE : Bogner et al. (1997)lake and how these might impair designated lake uses. The follow ing
is a summary of the various classifications of use impairment :
/H17039Full /H11005full support of designated uses, with minimal impairment.
/H17039Full/threatened /H11005full support of designated uses, with indications of
declining water quality or evidence of existing use impairment .
/H17039Partial/minor /H11005partial support of designated uses, with slight
impairment.
/H17039Partial/moderate /H11005partial support of designated uses, with moder-
ate impairment, only Partial is used after the year of 2000.
/H17039Nonsupport /H11005no support of designated uses, with severe impairment.
Lakes that fully support designated uses may still exhibit some impair-
ment, or have slight-to-moderate amounts of sediment, macrophytes, or
algae in a portion of the lake (e.g. headwaters or shoreline); however ,
most of the lake acreage shows minimal impairment of the aquati c com-
munity and uses. It is important to emphasize that if a lake is rated as
not fully supporting designated uses, it does not necessarily mea n that
the lake cannot be used for those purposes or that a health h azard exists .
Rather, it indicates impairment in the ability of signific ant portions of
the lake waters to support either a variety of quality recreati onal expe-
riences or a balanced sport fishery. Since most lakes are mult iple-use
water bodies, a lake can fully support one designated use (e.g. aquatic
life) but exhibit impairment of another (e.g. swimming).
Lakes that partially support designated uses have a designa ted use
that is slightly to moderately impaired in a portion of the l ake (e.g.
swimming impaired by excessive aquatic macrophytes or alga e, or boat-
ing impaired by sediment accumulation). So-called nonsupport lakes
have a designated use that is severely impaired in a substa ntial portion
of the lake (e.g. a large portion of the lake has so much sediment that
boat ramps are virtually inaccessible, boating is nearly impossible, and
fisheries are degraded). However, in other parts of the same nonsuppor t
lake (e.g. near a dam), the identical use may be supported. Again, non-
support does not necessarily mean that a lake cannot support  any uses,
that it is a public health hazard, or that its use is prohibite d.
Lake-use support and level of attainment shall be determined for
aquatic life, recreation, swimming, drinking water supply , fish con-
sumption, secondary contact, and overall lake use, using met hodolo-
gies described in the IEPA’s Illinois Water Quality Report 1994–1995
(IEPA, 1996).
The primary criterion in the aquatic life use assessment is a n aquatic
life use impairment index (ALI), while in the recreation use asses sment
the primary criterion is a recreation use impairment index (R UI). While
both indices combine ratings for TSI (Carlson, 1977) and degree of use160 Chapter 2impairment from sediment and aquatic macrophytes, each index  is
specifically designed for the assessed use. ALI and RUI relate d irectly
to the TP standard of 0.05mg/L. If a lake water sample is found to have
a TP concentration at or below the standard, the lake is given a “full sup-
port” designation. The aquatic life use rating reflects the degr ee of
attainment of the “fishable goal” of the Clean Water Act, whereas  the
recreation use rating reflects the degree to which pleasure boatin g,
canoeing, and esthetic enjoyment may be obtained at an indivi dual lake.
The assessment of swimming use for primary-contact recreation was
based on available data using two criteria: (1) Secchi disc  transparency
depth data and (2) Carlson’s TSI. The swimming use rating r eflects the
degree of attainment of the “swimmable goal” of the Clean Water Act .
If a lake is rated “nonsupport” for swimming, it does n ot mean that the
lake cannot be used or that health hazards exist. It indica tes that
swimming may be less desirable than at those lakes assessed as fully
or partially supporting swimming.
Finally, in addition to assessing individual aquatic li fe, recreation, and
swimming uses, and drinking water supply, the overall us e support of
the lake is also assessed. The overall use support methodology agg re-
gates the use support attained for each of the individual lake uses
assessed. Values assigned to each use-support attainment categ ory are
summed and averaged, and then used to assign an overall lak e use
attainment value for the lake.
Designated uses assessment. Multiple lakes designated are assessed for
aquatic life, recreation, drinking water supply, swimming , fish con-
sumption, and overall use. Specific criteria for determining a ttainment
of these designated lake uses are described below. The degree of use sup -
port attainment is described as full, full/threatened, parti al/minor
impairment, partial/moderate impairment, or nonsupport.
Aquatic life. An aquatic life use impairment index (ALI) which com-
bines ratings for trophic state index and the amount of use im pairments
from aquatic macrophytes and sediment is used as the primar y criteria
for assessing aquatic life lake use (Table 2.5). The higher the A LI
number, the more impaired the lake. Specific criteria used for ea ch level
of aquatic life use support attainment are presented in Table 2 .6.
Recreation. A recreation use impairment index (RUI), which com-
bines TSI and the amount of use impairments from aquatic life a nd
from sediment is utilized as the primary criteria for assessin g recreation
lake use (Table 2.7). Lake uses include pleasure boating, canoein g,
skiing, sailing, esthetic enjoyment, and fishing. The higher  the RUI
number, the more impaired the lake. Specific criteria used for ea ch level
of attaining recreation use support are listed in Table 2.8.Lakes and Reservoirs 161162 Chapter 2

sumption use support attainment can be found in Table 2.11.
Overall use. After assessing individual lake uses, the overall use sup-
port of a lake can be determined. The overall use support methodology
aggregates the use support attained for each of the individual lake uses
assessed (i.e. aquatic life, recreation, swimming, drinking water supply,
and fish consumption). The aggregation is achieved by averagin g indi-
vidual use attainments for a lake. For instance, individual  uses meet-
ing full, full/threatened, partial/minor, partial/moderate, or nonsupport
are assigned values from five (5) to one (1), respectively. The values
assigned to each individual use are subsequently summed and  averaged.
The average value is rounded down to the next whole number, which  is
then applied to assign an overall lake use attainment. Full support
attainment is assigned to an average value of 5; full/threaten ed, 4; partial/
minor, 3; partial/moderate, 2; and nonsupport, 1.
Example: The mean TSI is determined by averaging 18 months’ SD-TSI, TP-
TSI, and CHL-TSI values at station 1-surface (deepest station) and station
2-surface (midlake station) of a central Illinois lake, for values  of 54.3 and 58.9,
respectively. All Secchi disc readings were greater than 24 in. The mean of
nonvolatile suspended solids concentrations observed during 199 6–97 at sta-
tions 1-surface and 2-surface are 5 and 7 mg/L, respectively. E stimated macro-
phyte impairment and other observed data are given in Table 2 .12. Determine

*ALI, aquatic life use impairment index; RUI, recreation use impairment in dex.5. Determine the degree of aquatic life index use support
Since ALI points /H1100550 (i.e. /H11021 75) of the critical value, and there are poten-
tial threats to aquatic life impairment, the degree of use supp ort is fullfrom
Table 2.6.
Step 2. Assess recreation use
1. Determine the mean TSI of RUI point
Since mean TSI value is /H1100554.3, then RUI points for TSI /H1100554, from
section 1 of Table 2.7.
2. Determine macrophyte impairment of RUI point
Since /H11021 5% of the lake’s surface area is covered by weeds, from section 2
of Table 2.7, the RUI point for MI /H110050.
3. Determine sediment impairment
The mean NVSS is 5 mg/L. From section 3 of Table 2.7, for sediment
impairment (NVSS), RUI /H110055.
4. Compute total RUI points

5. Determine the degree of recreation use support
Total RUI points /H11021 60, therefore the degree of recreation use is considered
as Full from Table 2.8.
Step 3. Assess swimming use
1. Based on Secchi disc transparency
Since no Secchi depth is less than 24 in, from Table 2.9, t he degree of use
support is classified as Full.
2. Fecal coliform criteria
No fecal coliform density is determined
3. Based on trophic state index
Mean TSI /H1100554.3. From Table 2.9, it can be classified as Full.
4. Determine swimming use support
Based on the above use analysis, it is assessed as Full for swimming use
support.
Step 4. Assess drinking water supply use
There was no drinking water supply closure or advisories duri ng the
1996–97 study period. Also no chemicals were applied to the l ake. It is con-
sidered as Full use support for drinking water supply.Lakes and Reservoirs 167Step 5. Assess overall use for station 1
On the basis of overall use criteria, the assigned score values  for each indi-
vidual use are as follows:
Aquatic life use 5
Recreation use 5
Swimming use 5
Drinking water use 5
Total 20
The average value is 5. Then the overall use for station 1 is att ained as Full
(Table 2.12).
Step 6. Assess for station 2
Most assessments are as for station 1 except the following:
1. Recreation use:
From Table 2.12, we obtain RUI points /H1100564 which is in the critical range
60 /H11349; RUI /H1102175; therefore, the degree of research on use is considered as
partial/minor from Table 2.8.
2. The assigned scores for overall use are
Aquatic life use 5
Recreation use 3
Swimming use 5
Drinking water supply 5
Total 18
The average is 4.5, which is rounded down to the next whole num ber, 4. Then,
the overall use for station 2 is attained as full/threatened .
5.11 Lake budgets (ﬂuxes)
Calculation of lake budgets (fluxes) usually includes the hydr ologic
budget, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) budgets, and the sediment
budget. These data should be generated in Phases I, II, and II I studies.
Hydrologic budget. A lake’s hydrologic budget is normally quantified on
the basis of the height of water spread over the entire lake surfac e area
entering or leaving the lake in a year period. The hydrologic bu dget of
a lake is determined by the general formula:
Storage change /H11005inflows /H11002outflows (2.18)
or
/H9004S /H11005P/H11001I /H11001U /H11002E /H11002O /H11002R (2.18a)
(Equations. (2.18) and (2.18a) are essentially the same.)168 Chapter 2In general, inflow to the lake includes direct precipitation ( P), watershed
surface runoff ( I), subsurface groundwater inflow through lake bottom
(U), and pumped input, if any. Outflows include lake surface ev aporation
(E), discharge through surface outlet ( O), outflow through lake bottom
(groundwater recharge, R), and pumped outflow for water supply use, if any.
The storage term is positive if the water level increases in the p eriod
and negative if it decreases. The unit of the storage can be, sim ply, in
(or mm) or acre /H11080ft (or ha /H11080cm). The hydrologic budget is used to com-
pute nutrient budgets and the sediment budget and in selecti ng and
designing pollution control and lake restoration alternatives.
Example: Table 2.13 illustrates the hydrologic analysis from Vienna
Correctional Center Lake, a water supply lake (Bogner et al., 1997). Date
needed for evaluating various parameters (Eq. (2.8)) to develop a hy drologic
budget for the lake were collected for a 1-year period (October 1995 t o
September 1996). Table 2.13 presents monthly and annual resu lts of this
monitoring. Data sources and methods are explained as below:

vals or less. On the basis of water-level record frequency, chang es in storage
were estimated by multiplying the periodic change in lake st orage from the
water-level recorder by the lake surface area ( A) to determine net inflow or
outflow volume.
Step 2. Compute direct precipitation
Direct precipitation was obtained from the precipitation record  at the
University of Illinois’ Dixon Spring Experiment Station. The v olume of direct
precipitation input to the lake was determined by multiplyi ng the precipita-
tion depth by A.
Step 3. Compute spillway discharge Q
The general spillway rating equation was used as below:
Q/H110053.1 LH1.5/H110053.1(120)( H1.5)
Where L/H11005spillway length, ft
H /H11005the height or water level exceeding the spillway
Step 4. Estimate evaporation
Evaporation was estimated using average monthly values for Ca rbondale in
Lake Evaporation in Illinois (Robert and Stall, 1967). Monthl y evaporation
rates were reduced to daily rates by computing an average dai ly value for each
month. The daily lake surface evaporation volume was determined for  the
study period by multiplying the daily average evaporation d epth by A.
Step 5. Obtain water supply withdraw rate
The daily water supply withdraw rates were taken directly fr om the monthly
reports of the water treatment plant.
Step 6. Estimate groundwater inflow and surface inflow
Groundwater inflow and surface water inflow could not be estimat ed from
direct measurements and instead were determined on the basis of a  series of
sorting steps:
a. If the daily spillway discharge was zero and no rainfall occurred during
the preceding 3 days, all inflow was attributed to seepage from  the ground-
water system.
b. If there was precipitation during the preceding 3-day period , or if there
was discharge over the spillway, the groundwater input was  not deter-
mined in Step 6a. In this case, a moving average was used for the ground-
water parameter based on the Step 6a values determined for the
preceding 5-day and following 10-day periods.
c. If the daily balance indicated an outflow from the lake, it was attributed
to seepage into the groundwater inflow/outflow to the lake; the surfa ce
water inflow to the lake was determined to be any remaining infl ow
volume needed to achieve a daily balance.170 Chapter 2Step 7. Summary
Table 2.14 summarizes the hydrologic budget for the 1-year monit oring period.
The inflows and outflows listed in Table 2.14 are accurate wit hin the limits
of the analysis. During the study period, 18.9, 70.4, 7.8 , and 2.9% of the inflow
volume to the lake were, respectively, direct precipitation on th e lake surface,
watershed surface runoff, groundwater inflow, and decrease in stor age.
Outflow volume was 50.9% water supply withdrawal, 33.0% sp illway over-
flow, and 16.1% evaporation.
Nutrient and sediment budgets. Although nitrogen and phosphorus are
not the only nutrients required for algal growth, they are gener ally con-
sidered to be the two main nutrients involved in lake eutrophic ation.
Despite the controversy over the role of carbon as a limiting nut rient,
the vast majority of researchers regard phosphorus as the most fre-
quently limiting nutrient in lakes.
Several factors have complicated attempts to quantify the relat ionship
between lake trophic status and measured concentrations of nutr ients
in lake waters. For example, measured inorganic nutrient concen tra-
tions do not denote nutrient availability but merely represent what is
left over by the lake production process. A certain fraction of the nutri-
ents (particularly phosphorus) becomes refractory while passing  through
successive biological cycles. In addition, numerous morphometr ic and
chemical factors affect the availability of nutrients in lakes . Factors
such as mean depth, basin shape, and detention time affect th e amount
of nutrients a lake can absorb without creating nuisance con ditions.
Nutrient budget calculations represent the first step in qua ntifying theLakes and Reservoirs 171

essential to quantify nutrients from various sources for effective m an-
agement and eutrophication control.
A potential source of nitrogen and phosphorus for lakes is watersh ed
drainage, which can include agricultural runoff, urban r unoff, swamp
and forest runoff, domestic and industrial waste discharges, septic tank
discharges from lakeshore developments, precipitation on the lake sur-
face, dry fallout (i.e. leaves, dust, seeds, and pollen), groundw ater
influxes, nitrogen fixation, sediment recycling, and aquatic  bird and
animal wastes. Potential sink can include outlet losses, fish  catches,
aquatic plant removal, denitrification, groundwater recharg e, and sed-
iment losses.
The sources of nutrients considered for a lake are tributary inpu ts
from both gaged and ungaged streams, direct precipitation on the lake
surface, and internal nutrient recycling from bottom sediments  under
anaerobic conditions. The discharge of nutrients from the lake th rough
spillway is the only readily quantifiable sink.
The flow weighted-average method of computing nutrient transport
by the tributary are generally used in estimating the susp ended sedi-
ments, phosphorus, and nitrogen loads delivered by a tributa ry during
normal flow conditions. Each individual measurement of nitrogen  and
phosphorus concentrations in a tributary sample is used wi th the mean
flow values for the period represented by that sample to compute th e
nutrient transport for the given period. The total amount of any specific
nutrient transported by the tributary is given by the expr ession
(Kothandaraman and Evans, 1983; Lin and Raman, 1997):

A similar algorithm with appropriate constant (0.0255) can  be used for
determining the sediment and nutrient transport during stor m events.
For each storm event, niis the interval of time represented by the ith
sample and qiis the instantaneous flow in cfs for the period representedT kg52.446/H9018qiciniT lb55.394/H9018qicini172 Chapter 2by the ith sample. The summation is carried out for all the samples c ol-
lected in a tributary during each storm event. An automati c sampler can
be used to take stormwater samples.
The level of nutrient or sediment input is expressed either as a c on-
centration (mg/L) of pollutant or as mass loading per unit of la nd area
per unit time (kg/ha /H11080yr). There is no single correct way to express the
quantity of nutrient input to a lake. To analyze nutrient in puts to a lake,
the appropriate averaging time is usually 1 year, since th e approximate
hydraulic residence time in a lake is of this order of magnitu de and the
concentration value is a long-term average.
5.12 Soil loss rate
Specific soil loss rate from the watershed (for agricultural lan d, large
construction sites, and other land uses of open land) due to rai nfall can
be estimated through the universal soil loss equation or USLE
(Wischmeier and Smith, 1965):
A/H11005R/H11003LS/H11003K/H11003C/H11003P (2.20)
where A/H11005average soil loss rate, tons/(acre /H11080yr)
R/H11005rainfall factor
L/H11005slope length, ft
S/H11005slope steepness, %
LS /H11005length-slope factor or topographic factor (not Ltimes S)
K/H11005soil erodibility
C /H11005cropping and management factor
P/H11005conservation practice factor
The slope steepness, slope length, cropping factors, and erodibili ty of
each soil type cropping factor can be determined for various lan d uses
in consultation with the local (county) USDA Soil and Water C onservation
Service.
The R /H11003Pfactor value is assigned as 135 for Illinois agricultural crop-
land and 180 for other land uses. Wischmeier and Smith (196 5) and
Wischmeier et al. (1971) are useful references. The value of Pis one for
some CRP (Conservation Reserve Program) implementations after 1985.
Based on the soil information compiled in the watershed or sub-
watersheds (for example, Table 2.15), the soil loss rates can be computed.
The soil loss for each soil type for each subwatershed is obtained by mul-
tiplying the rate and soil acreage. The total soil loss for the watershed
is the sum of soil loss in all subwatersheds expressed as tons  per year.
Excluding the lake surface area, the mean soil erosion rate for t he water-
shed is estimated in terms of tons/(acre /H11080yr).Lakes and Reservoirs 173The USLE accounts for a series of factors that are the most signifi -
cant influences on the erosion of soil by precipitation. The USLE i s a cal-
culation of in-field soil losses and does not account for deposition from
the field to the stream or lake. Redeposition within the field or d rainage
system is accounted for by a sediment delivery ratio that defin es the pro-
portion of the upstream soil losses that actually pass throug h the stream
then to the lake.
The RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) is an updated v er-
sion of the USLE and was adopted recently by the USDA and many
states. The original USLE has been retained in RUSLE; however it  has
been put into a computer program to facilitate calculations, the tech-
nology for factor evaluation has been altered, and new data has been
introduced to evaluate each factor under more specific conditions.  There
are three tables for LSvalue determinations.
For the following example, taking the sum of annual loss for each soil
type, the total annual soil loss in the Nashville City Reser voir water-
shed (984.3 acres) is 2.953 tons (Table 2.16). This analysis  shows that
the average annual soil loss in the watershed is 3.5 tons/(ac re /H11080yr).
Example: Estimate the watershed soil loss rate for the Nashville City
Reservoir watershed in Washington County, Illinois (southern). Use USLE
instead of RUSLE, since new factors are not yet available. 174 Chapter 2

SOURCE : Lin, 2001Step 2. Obtain the values for, K, L, S, and C
Obtain “Soil Survey of Washington County, Illinois’’ from the USDA office. The
soil types, values of Kand S, and soil classifications, etc. are listed in the book.
Values for Land Ccan be obtained by consultation with USDA or the county’s
Soil and Water Conservation District personnel. These values for each type
of soil are presented in Table 2.16.
Step 3. Measure the area coverage for each type of soil
The area coverage for each type of soil in the watershed can be direc tly meas-
ured from “Soil Survey of Washington County, Illinois.” The area  coverage for
each type of soil is listed in Table 2.15.
Step 4. Find LS value
The LSvalue can be determined from tables of topographic factor based on
L, S, R, and land use; and then listed in Table 2.16 for calcula tions.
Step 5. Calculate annual soil loss rate for a type of soil
For soil type 2: Using Eq. (2.20), A/H11005R/H11003K/H11003LS/H11003C/H11003P
/H11005200 /H110030.37 /H110030.11 /H110030.37 /H110031.0
/H110053.0 (tons/acre /H11080yr) (see Table 2.16)
Step 6. Calculate total annual soil loss for each type of soil
The total annual soil loss for each type of soil is calculated fr om annual soil
loss rates for that soil type multiplying by the area coverag e, such as
For soil type 2: Total soil loss /H110053.0 tons/acre /H11080yr /H1100338 acres 
/H11005114 tons/yr 
Step 7. The total annual soil loss for other soil types can be det ermined in
the same manner as above and listed in Table 2.16.
Step 8. Calculate the total annual soil loss (2.953 tons from Table 2.16) in
the watershed

1.1 Groundwater and aquifer
Groundwater is subsurface water which occurs beneath the eart h’s sur-
face. In a hydraulic water cycle, groundwater comes from surfa ce waters
(precipitation, lake, reservoir, river, sea, etc.) and percolates  into the
ground beneath the water table. The groundwater table is the su rface
of the groundwater exposed to an atmospheric pressure beneath the
ground surface (the surface of the saturated zone). A water table may
fluctuate in elevation.
An aquifer is an underground water-saturated stratum or forma tion
that can yield usable amounts of water to a well. There are two differ-
ent types of aquifers based on physical characteristics. If t he saturated
zone is sandwiched between layers of impermeable material and the
groundwater is under pressure, it is called a confined aquifer  (Fig. 3.1).
If there is no impermeable layer immediately above the saturated zone,
that is called an unconfined aquifer. In an unconfined aquifer , the top
of the saturated zone is the water table defined as above.
Aquifers are replenished by water infiltrated through the earth  above
from the upland area. The area replenishing groundwater is cal led the
recharge area. In reverse, if the groundwater flows to the lower la nd
area, such as lakes, streams, or wetlands, it is called d ischarge.
On the earth, approximately 3% of the total water is freshwater.  Of
this, groundwater comprises 95%, surface water 3.5%, and soil  moisture
1.5%. Out of all the freshwater on earth, only 0.36% is readily  available
to use (Leopold, 1974).
Groundwater is an important source of water supply. Fifty-three
percent of the population of the United States receives its water s upply
from groundwater or underground sources (US EPA, 1994). Groundw ater
is also a major source of industrial uses (cooling, water supp ly, etc.) and
agricultural uses (irrigation and livestock). The quantity of groundwa-
ter available is an important value. The so-called safe yield of an aquifer
is the practicable rate of withdrawing water from it perennia lly. Such
a safe amount does not exist, however.
The quantity of groundwater is also affected by water engineering.  For
decades and centuries, through improper disposal of wastes (soli d, liquid,
and gaseous) to the environment and subsurface areas, many grou nd-
waters have become contaminated. Major sources of contaminants a re
possibly from landfill leachate, industrial wastes, agricu ltural chemicals,
wastewater effluents, oil and gasoline (underground tanks, anim al
wastes, acid-mine drainage, road salts, hazardous wastes sp illage,
household and land chemicals, etc.). Illegal dumping of wast es and toxic
chemicals to waterways and to lands are major environmental problems
in many countries. Water quality problem is grown in the U nited States
and in global.180 Chapter 3Groundwater 181
Efforts to protect the quantity and quality of groundwater hav e been
made by cooperation between all government agencies, interested par -
ties, and researchers. Most states are responsible for research, educa-
tion, establishment of minimum setback zones for public and pr ivate
water supply wells, and contamination survey and remediati on.
Figure 3.1 Drawdown, cone of depression, and radius of influence in unconfined
and confined aquifers ( Illinois EPA, 1995 ).1.2 Zones of inﬂuence and capture
The withdrawal of groundwater by a pumping well causes a low ering
of the water level. Referring to Fig. 3.2, the difference between water
levels during nonpumping and pumping is called drawdown.  The pattern
of drawdown around a single pumping well resembles a cone. The a rea182 Chapter 3
Figure 3.2 Relationship between the cone of depression and the zone of capture within a
regional flow field ( Illinois EPA, 1995 ).affected by the pumping well is called the cone of depression, the radius
of influence, or lateral area of influence (LAI). Within the LAI, the flow
velocity continuously increases as it flows toward the well du e to grad-
ually increased slope or hydraulic gradient.
As a well pumps groundwater to the surface, the groundwater w ith-
drawn from around the well is replaced by water stored within  the
aquifer. All water overlaid on the nonpumping potentiometric su rface
will eventually be pulled into the well. This area of water enter ing the
area of influence of the well is called the zone of capture (ZOC), zone of
contribution, or capture zone (Fig. 3.2). The ZOC generally extends
upgradient from the pumping well to the edge of the aquifer or to a
groundwater divide. The ZOC is usually asymmetrical. It i s important
to identify the ZOC because any pollution will be drawn towar d the
well, subsequently contaminating the water supply.
A ZOC is usually referred to the time of travel as a time-related cap-
ture zone. For instance, a “10-year” time-related capture zone is th e
area within which the water at the edge of the zone will reach t he well
within 10-years. The state primacy has established setback zones for
wells which will be discussed later.
Example 1: Groundwater flows into a well at 4 in/d (10 cm/d) and is 36 5 ft
(111 m) from the well. Estimate the capture time.
solution:
Time /H11005365 ft/(4/12 ft/d)
/H110051095 days
or /H110053-year time-related capture zone
Example 2: Calculate the distance from a well to the edge of the 3-year cap-
ture zone if the groundwater flow is 2 ft/d (0.61 m/d).
solution:
Distance /H110052 ft/d /H110033 years /H11003365 d/yr
/H110052190 ft 
or /H11005668 m
1.3 Wells
Wells are classified according to their uses by the US Envir onmental
Protection Agency (EPA). A public well is defined as having a m inimum
of 15 service connections or serving 25 persons at least 60 d/y r.
Community public wells serve residents the year round. Noncomm unity
public wells serve nonresidential populations at places such  as schools,
factories, hotels, restaurants, and campgrounds. Wells that  do not meet
the definition of public wells are classified as either semipriv ate or private.Groundwater 183Semiprivate wells serve more than one single-family dwelling, bu t fewer
than 15 connections or serving 25 persons. Private wells serve an owner-
occupied single-family dwelling.
Wells are also classified into types based on construction. The most
common types of wells are drilled and bored dependent on the aquifer
to be tapped, and the needs and economic conditions of the users (B abbitt
et al., 1959; Forest and Olshansky, 1993).
2 Hydrogeologic Parameters
There are three critical aquifer parameters: porosity, specific y ield (or
storativity for confined aquifers), and hydraulic conductivit y (including
anisotropy). These parameters required relatively sophisticated fi eld
and laboratory procedures for accurate measurement.
Porosity and specific yield/storativity express the aquifer stor age
properties. Hydraulic conductivity (permeability) and transm issivity
describe the groundwater transmitting properties.
2.1 Aquifer porosity
The porosity of soil or fissured rock is defined as the ratio of void volume
to total volume (Wanielista, 1990; Bedient and Huber, 1992):
(3.1)
where n/H11005porosity
Vv/H11005volume of voids within the soil
V/H11005total volume of sample (soil)
Vs/H11005volume of the solids within the soil
/H11005dry weight of sample/specific weight
The ratio of the voids to the solids within the soil is called t he void ratio
eexpressed as
e/H11005Vv/Vs (3.2)
Then the relationship between void ratio and porosity is
(3.3)
or
(3.4) n5e
11ee5n
12nn5Vv
V5sV2Vsd
V512Vs
V184 Chapter 3The porosity may range from a small fraction to about 0.90. Ty pical
values of porosity are 0.2 to 0.4 for sands and gravels dependi ng on the
grain size, size of distribution, and the degree of compaction; 0. 1 to 0.2
for sandstone; and 0.01 to 0.1 for shale and limestone depending  on the
texture and size of the fissures (Hammer, 1986).
When groundwater withdraws from an aquifer and the water tabl e is
lowered, some water is still retained in the voids. This is ca lled the spe-
cific retention. The quantity drained out is called the specifi c yield. The
specific yield for alluvial sand and gravel is of the order of 9 0% to 95%.
Example: If the porosity of sands and gravels in an aquifer is 0.38 a nd the
specific yield is 92%, how much water can be drained per cub ic meter of
aquifer?
solution:
Volume /H110050.38 /H110030.92 /H110031 m3
/H110050.35 m3
2.2 Storativity
The term storativity ( S) is the quantity of water that an aquifer will
release from storage or take into storage per unit of its surface ar ea per
unit change in land. In unconfined aquifers, the storativit y is in prac-
tice equal to the specific yield. For confined aquifers, storabili ty is
between 0.005 and 0.00005, with leaky confined aquifers falli ng in the
high end of this range (US EPA, 1994). The smaller storativit y of con-
fined aquifers, the larger the pressure change throughout a wid e area
to obtain a sufficient supply from a well. However, this is not the case
for unconfined aquifers due to gravity drainage.
2.3 Transmissivity
Transmissivity describes the capacity of an aquifer to tran smit a water.
It is the product of hydraulic conductivity (permeability) a nd the
aquifer’s saturated thickness:
T /H11005Kb (3.5)
where T/H11005transmissivity of an aquifer, gpd/ft or m3/(d /H11080m)
K/H11005permeability, gpd/ft2or m3/(d /H11080m2)
b/H11005thickness of aquifer, ft or m
A rough estimation of Tis by multiplying specific capacity by 2000 (US
EPA, 1994).Groundwater 185Example: If the aquifer’s thickness is 50 ft, estimate the permeability  of the
aquifer using data in the example of the specific capacity (in  Section 2.7).

Rearranging Eq. (3.5)
K/H11005T/b/H11005(30,000 gpm/ft)/50 ft
/H11005600 gpm/ft2
2.4 Flow nets
Many groundwater systems are two or three dimensional. Darcy’ s law
was first derived in a one dimensional equation. Using Darcy ’s law can
establish a set of streamlines and equipotential lines to develop  a two
dimensional flow net. The details of this concept are discussed el se-
where in the text (Bedient et al., 1994).
A flow net is constructed by flow lines that intersect the equip oten-
tial lines or contour lines at a right angle. Equipotential  lines are devel-
oped based on the observed water levels in wells penetrating an i sotropic
aquifer. Flow lines are then drawn orthogonally to indicate the flow
direction.
Referring to Fig. 3.3, the horizontal flow within a segment in a  flow
net can be determined by the following equation (US EPA, 1994):

Wa/H11005average width of segment A, m or ft

The flow in the next segment, B, is similarly computed as Eq.  (3.7)

Tb/H11005Ta(Lb/H9004HaWa/La/H9004HbWb) (3.8)
Measurement or estimation of transmissivity ( T) for one segment
allows the computation of variations in Tupgradient and downgradi-
ent. If variations in aquifer thickness are known, or can be estimated
for different segments, variation in hydraulic conductivity c an also be
calculated as
K /H11005T/b (3.9)
where K/H11005hydraulic conductivity, m/d or ft/d
T/H11005transmissivity, m2/d or ft2/d
b/H11005aquifer thickness, m or ft
Equation (3.9) is essentially the same as Eq. (3.5).
2.5 Darcy’s law
The flow movement of water through the ground is entirely different
from the flow in pipes and in an open channel. The flow of fluids t hrough
porous materials is governed by Darcy’s law. It states tha t the flow
velocity of fluid through a porous medium is proportional to the
hydraulic gradient (referring to Fig. 3.4):

The pore velocity vpis equal to the Darcy velocity divided by porosity as
follows:
vp/H11005v/n (3.11)
Darcy’s law is applied only in the laminar flow region. Gr oundwater
flow may be considered as laminar when the Reynolds number is less
than unity (Rose, 1949). The Reynolds number can be expressed as
(3.12)

2.6 Permeability
The terms permeability ( P) and hydraulic conductivity ( K) are often used
interchangeably. Both are measurements of water moving through the
soil or an aquifer under saturated conditions. The hydraulic conductiv-
ity, defined by Nielsen (1991), is the quantity of water that will flow
through a unit cross-sectional area of a porous media per unit of time
under a hydraulic gradient of 1.0 (measured at right angles  to the direc-
tion of flow) at a specified temperature.

Groundwater flows through permeable materials, such as sand,
gravel, and sandstone, and is blocked by less permeable mater ial, such
as clay. Few materials are completely impermeable in nature. E ven
solid bedrock has fine cracks, so groundwater can flow through .
Groundwater recharge occurs when surface water infiltrates the soil
faster than it is evaporated, used by plants, or stored as s oil moisture.
Field measurement of permeability. Ideal steady-state flow of ground-
water is under the conditions of uniform pump withdrawal, a stable
drawdown curve, laminar and horizontal uniform flow, a flow vel ocity
proportional to the tangent of the hydraulic gradient, and a homoge-
neous aquifer. Assuming these ideal conditions, the well flow is  a func-
tion of the coefficient of permeability, the shape of the drawdown cur ve,
and the thickness of the aquifer. For an unconfined aquifer the wel l
discharge can be expressed as an equilibrium equation (Steel a nd

pumping tests are carried out with two observation wells to d etermine the
coefficient of permeability of the aquifer. The distances between the tes t well
and observation wells 1 and 2 are 10.0 and 30.2 m (32.8 a nd 99.0 ft), respec-
tively. Before pumping, the initial piezometric surface in the t est well and the
observation wells are 10.4 m (34.1 ft) below the ground surface. After pump-
ing at a discharge rate of 0.29 m3/s (4600 gpm) for a few days, the water
levels in the wells are stabilized with the following drawdowns : 8.6 m
(28.2 ft) in the test well, 5.5 m (18.0 ft) in the observation well 1, and 3.2 m
(10.5 ft) in the observation well 2. Compute (a) the coefficient of perm eabil-

2.7 Speciﬁc capacity
The permeability can be roughly estimated by a simple field wel l test. The
difference between the static water level prior to any pumping an d the
level to which the water drops during pumping is called dr awdown
(Fig. 3.2). The discharge (pumping) rate divided by the draw down is the
specific capacity. The specific capacity gives the quantity  of water produced
from the well per unit depth (ft or m) of drawdown. It is calcul ated by
Specific capacity /H11005Q/wd (3.19)
where Q/H11005discharge rate, gpm or m3/s

Example: The static water elevation is at 572 ft (174.3 m) before pumping .
After a prolonged normal well pumping rate of 120 gpm (7.6 L/s),  the water
level is at 564 ft (171.9 m). Calculate the specific capacit y of the well.

h2hdh196 Chapter 34 Anisotropic Aquifers
Most real geologic formations tend to have more than one direction for
the movement of water due to the nature of the material and its ori en-
tation. Sometimes, a soil formation may have a hydraulic cond uctivity
(permeability) in the horizontal direction, Kx, radically different from
that in the vertical direction, Kz. This phenomenon ( Kx/HS11005Kz), is called
anisotropy. When hydraulic conductivities are the same in al l direc-
tions, ( Kx/H11005Kz), the aquifer is called isotropic. In typical alluvial dep osits,
Kxis greater than Kz. For a two-layered aquifer of different hydraulic
conductivities and different thicknesses, applying Darcy’s law to hori-
zontal flow can be expressed as

5 Unsteady (Nonequilibrium) Flows
Equilibrium equations described in the previous sections usu ally over-
estimate hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity. In  practical situa-
tions, equilibrium usually takes a long time to reach. Theis  (1935)
originated the equation relations for the flow of groundwater into w ells
and was then improved on by other investigators (Jacob, 1940,  1947;
Wenzel 1942; Cooper and Jacob, 1946).
Three mathematical/graphical methods are commonly used for esti-
mations of transmissivity and storativity for nonequilibriu m flow con-
ditions. They are the Theis method, the Cooper and Jacob (straight -line)
method, and the distance-drawdown method.

(3.33b)
Values of W(u) for various values of uare listed in Appendix B, which
is a complete table by Wenzel (1942) and modified from Illinois EP A
(1990).
If the coefficient of transmissibility Tand the coefficient of storage S
are known, the drawdown dcan be calculated for any time and at any
point on the cone of depression including the pumped well. Obtai ning
these coefficients would be extremely laborious and is seldom complet ely
satisfied for field conditions. The complete solution of the Theis equa-
tion requires a graphical method of two equations (Eqs. (3.31) a nd (3.32))
with four unknowns.
Rearranging as:
(3.31)
and
(3.34)
Theis (1935) first suggested plotting W(u) on log-log paper, called a
type curve . The values of Sand Tmay be determined from a series of
drawdown observations on a well with known times. Also, prepa re
another plot, of values of dagainst r2/ton transparent log-log paper, with
the same scale as the other figure. The two plots (Fig. 3.5) are su per-
imposed so that a match point can be obtained in the region of which
the curves nearly coincide when their coordinate axes are paral lel. The
coordinates of the match point are marked on both curves. Thus, values
of u, W(u), d, and r2/tcan be obtained. Substituting these values into
Eqs. (3.31) and (3.32), values of Tand Scan be calculated.

5.3 Distance-drawdown method
The distance-drawdown method is a modification of the Cooper and
Jacob method and is applied to obtain quick information about  the
aquifer characteristics while the pumping test is in progr ess. The method
needs simultaneous observations of drawdown in three or more obser-
vation wells. The aquifer properties can be determined from pumpin g
tests by the following equations (Watson and Burnett, 1993):

The distance-drawdown method involves the following procedures:
1. Plot the distance and drawdown data on semilog paper; draw down
on the arithmetic scale and the distance on the logarithmic scale.
2. Read the drawdown per log cycle in the same manner for the Coop er
and Jacob method: this gives the value of /H9004(h0– h).S5Tt

In the preceding sections, the transmissivity Tand storativity Sof the
aquifer and permeability Kof the soil are determined by boring one or
two more observation wells. Slug tests use only a single well for  the
determination of those values by careful evaluation of the drawdown
curve and information of screen geometry. The tests involve either ra is-
ing or lowering the water level in the well and measuring the return to
a static water level as a function of time.206 Chapter 3
Figure 3.7 Plot of observed distance-drawdown data.A typical test procedure requires introducing an object to recor d the
volume (the slug) of the well. The Hvorslev (1951) method using a
piezometer in an confined aquifer is widely used in practice due to it
being quick and inexpensive. The procedures of conducting and a na-
lyzing the Hvorslev test (Fig. 3.8) are as follows:
1. Record the instantaneously raised (or lowered) water level to the
static water level as H0.
2. Read subsequently changing water levels with time as h. Thus h/H11005

Other slug test methods have been developed for confined aquifers
(Cooper et al., 1967; Papadopoulous et al., 1973; Bouwer and Rice, 1976).
These methods are similar to Theis’s type curves in that a cur ve-matching
method is used to determine Tand Sfor a given aquifer. A family of type
curves Ht/H0versus Tr/r2
cwere published for five values of the variable,
(defined as ( r2
s/r2
c) S, to estimate transmissivity, storativity, and hydrauli c
conductivity.
The Bouwer and Rice (1976) slug test method is most commonly used
for estimating hydraulic conductivity in groundwater. Alt hough the
method was originally developed for unconfined aquifers, it can a lso be
applied for confined or stratified aquifers if the top of the screen i s some
distance below the upper confined layer. The following formula is u sed
to compute hydraulic conductivity:

6 Groundwater Contamination
6.1 Sources of contamination
There are various sources of groundwater contamination and variou s
types of contaminants. Underground storage tanks, agricultu ral activity,
municipal landfills, abandoned hazardous waste sites, and septic tanks 5s5 cmd2 lns12 cm/8 cmd

trial spill, injection wells, land application, illegal dumps (big problem
in many countries), road salt, saltwater intrusion, oil an d gas wells,
mining and mine drainage, municipal wastewater effluents, s urface
impounded waste material stockpiles, pipelines, radioactive w aste dis-
posal, and transportation accidents.
Large quantities of organic compounds are manufactured and used  by
industries, agriculture, and municipalities. These man-mad e organic
compounds are of most concern. The inorganic compounds occur in
nature and may come from natural sources as well as human a ctivities.
Metals from mining, industries, agriculture, and fossil fuel s also may
cause groundwater contamination.
Types of contaminants are classified by chemical group. They a re
metals (arsenic, lead, mercury, etc.), volatile organic compoun ds
(VOCs) (gasoline, oil, paint thinner), pesticides and herbicid es, and
radionuclides (radium, radon). The most frequently reported ground -
water contaminants are the VOCs (Voelker, 1984; Rehfeldt et al .,
1992).
Volatile organic compounds are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxy gen
and have a vapor pressure less than one atmosphere. Compounds s uch
as gasoline or dry cleaning fluid evaporate when left open to the air.
They are easily dissolved in water. There are numerous incidences of
VOCs contamination caused by leaking underground storage ta nks.
Groundwater contaminated by VOCs poses cancer risks to huma ns either
by ingestion of drinking water or inhalation.
6.2 Contaminant transport pathways
The major contaminant transport mechanisms in groundwater a re
advection, diffusion, dispersion, adsorption, chemical reaction , and
biodegradation. Advection is the movement of contaminant(s) with the
flowing groundwater at the seepage velocity in the pore space and  is
expressed as Darcy’s law:
(3.49)
where vx/H11005seepage velocity, m/s or pps
K/H11005hydraulic conductivity, m/s or fps
n/H11005porosity
dh/H11005pressure head, m or ft
L/H11005distance, m or ft
Equation (3.49) is similar to Eq. (3.10b).vx5K
n dh
L212 Chapter 3Diffusion is a molecular-scale mass transport process that mov es
solutes from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower con-
centration. Diffusion is expressed by Fick’s law:
(3.50)
where Fx/H11005mass flux, mg/m2/H11080s or lb/ft2/H11080s
Dd/H11005diffusion coefficient, m2/s or ft2/s
dc/dx/H11005concentration gradient, mg/(m3/H11080m)
or lb/(ft3/H11080ft)
Diffusive transport can occur at low or zero flow velocities. In a  tight soil
or clay, typical values of Ddrange from 1 to 2 /H11003109m2/s at 25 /H11034C (Bedient
et al. 1994). However, typical dispersion coefficients in groundwater are
several orders of magnitude greater than that in clay.
Dispersion is a mixing process caused by velocity variation s in porous
media. Mass transport due to dispersion can occur parallel and normal
to the direction of flow with two-dimensional spreading.
Sorption is the interaction of a contaminant with a solid. I t can be
divided into adsorption and absorption. An excess concentrati on of con-
taminants at the surfaces of solids is called adsorption. Ab sorption refers
to the penetration of the contaminants into the solids.
Biodegradation is a biochemical process that transforms conta mi-
nants (certain organics) into simple carbon dioxide and water  by microor-
ganisms. It can occur in aerobic and anaerobic conditions.  Anaerobic
biodegradation may include fermentation, denitrification, iron reduction,
sulfate reduction, and methane production.
Excellent and complete coverage of contaminant transport mecha-
nisms is presented by Bedient et al. (1994). Theories and examples are
covered for mass transport, transport in groundwater by advec tion, dif-
fusion, dispersion, sorption, chemical reaction, and bio-degrad ation.
Some example problems of contaminant transport are also given by
Tchobanoglous and Schroeder (1985). Mathematical models that a nalyze
complex contaminant pathways in groundwater are also discu ssed else-
where (Canter and Knox, 1986; Willis and Yeh, 1987; Canter  et al., 1988;
Mackay and Riley, 1993; Smith and Wheatcraft, 1993; Wat son and
Burnett, 1993; James, 1993; Gupta, 1997).
The transport of contaminants in groundwater involves adsorpti on,
advection, diffusion, dispersion, interface mass transfer, bioch emical
transformations, and chemical reactions. On the basis of mas s balance,
the general equation describing the transport of a dissolved con taminant
through an isotropic aquifer under steady-state flow conditions can be
mathematically expressed as (Gupta, 1997).Fx52Dd dc

6.3 Underground storage tank
There are 3 to 5 million underground storage tanks (USTs) in th e United
States. It is estimated that 3% to 10% of these tanks and thei r associ-
ated piping systems may be leaking (US EPA 1987). The majorit y ofR 'c

w214 Chapter 3USTs contain petroleum products (gasoline and other petroleum pr od-
ucts). When the UST leaks and is left unattended, and subsequen tly con-
taminates subsurface soils, surface and groundwater monitorin g and
corrective actions are required.
The migration or transport pathways of contaminants from the U ST
depend on the quantity released, the physical properties of the c on-
taminant, and characteristics of the soil particles.
When a liquid contaminant is leaked from a UST below the ground
surface, it percolates downward to the unconfined groundwater su r-
face. If the soil characteristics and contaminant properties are known,
it can be estimated whether the contaminant will reach the g roundwater.
For hydrocarbons in the unsaturated (vadose) zone, it can be estim ated
by the equation (US EPA 1987):
(3.54)
where D/H11005maximum depth of penetration, m
Rv/H11005a coefficient of retention capacity of the soil and the
viscosity of the product (contaminant)
V/H11005volume of infiltrating hydrocarbon, m3
A/H11005are of spell, m2
The typical values for Rvare as follows (US EPA, 1987):
Retention (attenuative) capacities for hydrocarbons vary approxi mately
from 5 L/m3in coarse gravel to more than 40 L/m3in silts. Leaked gaso-
line can travel 25 ft (7.6 m) through unsaturated, permeable,  alluvial,
or glacial sediments in a few hours, or at most a few days, w hich is
extremely site specific.
The major movement of nonaqueous-phase liquids that are less dense
than water (such as gasoline and other petroleum products) in the cap-
illary zone (between unsaturated and saturated zones) is lateral.  The
plume will increase thickness (vertical plane) and width dep ending on
leakage rates and the site’s physical conditions. The charac teristic shape
of the flow is the so-called “oil package.” Subsequently, it wil l plug the
pores of the soil or be diluted and may be washed out into the wa ter table.Soil Gasoline Kerosene Light fuel oil

AGroundwater 215The transport of miscible or dissolved substances in saturated  zones
follows the general direction of groundwater flow. The transport pat h-
ways can be applied to the models (laws) of advection and disper sion.
The dispersion may include molecular diffusion, microscopic dis persion,
and macroscopic dispersion.
Immiscible substances with a specific gravity of less than  1.0 (lighter
than water) are usually found only in the shallow part of the saturated
zone. The transport rate depends on the groundwater gradient and the
viscosity of the substance.
Immiscible substances with a specific gravity of more than 1.0 (denser
than water) move downward through the saturated zone. A dense
immiscible substance poses a greater danger in terms of migra tion
potential than less dense substances due to its deeper penetrati on into
the saturated zone. When the quantity of released contaminant exceed s
the retention capacity of the unsaturated and saturated zones, the
denser nonaqueous-phase liquid continues its downward migrati on
until it reaches an impermeable boundary. A liquid substan ce leaking
from a UST enters the vapor phase in the unsaturated zone accordi ng
to its specific vapor pressure. The higher the vapor pressure of t he sub-
stance, the more it evaporates. The contaminant in the vapor ph ase
moves by advection and by diffusion. Vapor moves primarily in  a hor-
izontal direction depending on the slope of the water table and th e
location of the impermeable bedrock. If the vapor, less dense than air,
migrates in a vertical direction, it may accumulate in s ewer lines, base-
ments, and such areas.
6.4 Groundwater treatment
Once a leaking UST is observed, corrective action should be car ried out,
such as tank removal, abandonment, rehabilitation, removal/ excavation
of soil and sediment, on-site and/or off-site treatment and disposal  of
contaminants, product and groundwater recovery, groundwater
treatment, etc.
Selection of groundwater treatment depends on the contaminants to
be removed. Gasoline and volatile organic compounds can be removed
by air stripping and stream stripping processes. Activa ted carbon
adsorption, biological treatment, and granular media filtra tion can be
used for removal of gasoline and other organics. Nonvolatile organi cs are
removable by oxidation/reduction processes. Inorganic chemicals  can
be treated by coagulation/sedimentation, neutralization, dissol ved air
flotation, granular media filtration, ion exchange, resin ads orption, and
reverse osmosis.
These treatment processes are discussed in detail in Chapter 5,  Public
Water Supply, and in Chapter 6, Wastewater.216 Chapter 37 Setback Zones
Section 1428 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requires each  state
to submit a wellhead protection program to the US Environmenta l
Protection Agency (EPA). For example, Illinois EPA promulgated the
Illinois Groundwater Protection Act (IGPA) in 1991. The Act as signed
the responsibilities of existing state agencies and established  ground-
water classifications. On the basis of classification, differen t water qual-
ity standards, monitoring, and remedial requirements can b e applied.
Classifications are based on the PCB levels which may be assoc iated
with hazardous wastes.
Groundwater used as a public water supply source is called  potable
groundwater. This requires the highest degree of protection with t he
most stringent standards. The groundwater quality standar ds for
potable groundwater are generally equal to the US EPA’s maxim um
contamination levels applicable at the tap pursuant to the SDWA. The
rationale is that potable groundwater should be safe for drinki ng water
supply without treatment.
The state primacy agency establishes a comprehensive program for
the protection of groundwater. Through interagency cooperation, loca l
groundwater protection programs can help to prevent unexpected a nd
costly water supply systems. An Illinois community experien ced a leak-
ing gasoline underground tank, operated by the city-owned gara ge. It
contaminated one well and threatened to contaminate the entire wel l
field. The city has spent more than $300,000 in an attempt to replace
the water supply.
Some parts of the groundwater protection programs, such as min i-
mum and maximum setback zones for wellhead protection, are used to
protect public and private drinking water supplies from pot ential sources
of groundwater contamination. Each community well must have a set-
back zone to restrict land use near the well. The setback zone prov ides
a buffer between the well and potential contamination sources and
routes. It will give time for cleanup efforts of contaminated groun dwa-
ter or to obtain an alternative water supply source before the exi sting
groundwater source becomes unfit for use.
A minimum setback zone is mandatory for each public well. Sit ing for
new potential primary or secondary pollution sources or potentia l routes
is prohibited within the setback zone. In Illinois, the mini mum setback
zone is a 200-ft (61-m) radius area around the wellhead for every wa ter
supply well. For some vulnerable aquifers, the zone may be 400 ft in
radius.
The maximum setback zone is a second level of protection from pol-
lution. It prohibits the siting of new potential primacy pol lution sources
within the area outside the minimum setback zone up to 1000 ft  (305 m)Groundwater 217from a wellhead in Illinois (Fig. 3.11). Maximum setback zones allow the
well owners, county or municipal government, and state to regu late
land use beyond the minimum setback zone.
The establishment of a maximum setback zone is voluntary. A requ est
to determine the technical adequacy of a maximum setback zone det er-
mination must first be submitted to the state by a municip ality or
county. Counties and municipalities served by community wa ter supply
wells are empowered to enact maximum setback zone ordinances. If
the community water supply wells are investor or privately ow ned, a
county or municipality served by that well can submit an  application on
behalf of the owner.
7.1 Lateral area of inﬂuence
As described in the previous section, the lateral radius of in fluence
(LRI) is the horizontal distance from the center of the well to the out er
limit of the cone of depression (Figs. 3.1 and 3.12). It is the d istance from
the well to where there is no draw of groundwater (no reduction in
water level). The lateral area of influence (LAI) outlines the extent of
the cone of depression on the land surface as shown in the hatched  area
in Fig. 3.12.218 Chapter 3
Figure 3.11 Maximum and minimum setback zones.The LAI in a confined aquifer is generally 4000 times greater th an the
LAI in an unconfined aquifer (Illinois EPA, 1990). If a pollut ant is intro-
duced within the LAI, it will reach the well faster than oth er water
replenishing the well. The slope of the water table steepens toward the
well within the LAI. Therefore, it is extremely important to ident ify
and protect the LAI. The LAI is used to establish a maximum s etback
zone.
7.2 Determination of lateral radius 
of inﬂuence
There are three types of determination methods for the LRI. They are
the direct measurement method, the use of the Theis equation or volu-
metric flow equation, and the use of a curve-matching technique with
the Theis equation. The third method involves the interpretation of
pump test data from observation wells within the minimum set back zone
using a curve-matching technique and the Theis equation to det ermine
the transmissivity and storativity of the aquifer. Once thes e aquifer
constants have been obtained, the Theis equation is then used to com-
pute the LRI of the well. It should be noted that when the observa tionGroundwater 219

well or piezometer measurement was made outside of the minimum
setback zone, the determination could have been conducted by the d irect
measurement method.
Volumetric flow equations adopted by the Illinois EPA (1990) are as
follows. For unconfined unconsolidated or unconfined nonfractured
bedrock aquifers, the LRI can be calculated by

Direct measurement method. The direct measurement method involves
direct measurement of drawdown in an observation well piezometer or
in an another production well. Both the observation well and a nother
production well should be located beyond the minimum setback zon e of
the production well and also be within the LAI.
Example: A steel tape is used to measure the water level of the observation
well located 700 ft from a drinking water well. The pump test results show
that under the normal operational conditions, 0.58 ft of drawd own compared
to the original nonpumping water level is recorded. Does this m ake the well
eligible for applying maximum setback zone?
Answer: Yes. A municipality or county may qualify to apply for a ma ximum
setback zone protection when the water level measurements show that  the
drawdown is greater than 0.01 ft and the observation well is  located beyond
(700 ft) the minimum setback zone (200 to 400 ft). It is also not  necessary to
estimate the LRI of the drinking water well.
Theis equation method. The Theis equation (Eqs. (3.56) and (3.57))
can be used to estimate the LRI of a well if the aquifer parameters ,
such as transmissivity, storativity, and hydraulic c onductivity, are
available or can be determined. The Theis equation is more useful i f
the observation well is located within the minimum setback zon e when
the direct measurement method cannot be applied. Equations (3.5 2) and
(3.53) can be used if pump test data are available for an unc onfined/
confined, unconsolidated or nonfractured bedrock aquifer (Illinois
EPA,1990).
Example: An aquifer test was conducted in a central Illinois county by the
Illinois State Water Survey (Walton 1992). The drawdown data from one of
the observations located 22 ft from the production well was anal yzed to deter-
mine the average aquifer constants as follows:
Transmissivity: T/H11005340,000 gpd/ft of drawdown
Storativity: S/H110050.09
The pumping rate under normal operational conditions was 1100  gpm. The
volume of the daily pumpage was 1,265,000 gal. Is this aq uifer eligible for a

of 1980 ft from the drinking water wellhead. Since ris greater than the min-
imum setback distance of 400 ft from the wellhead, the well is eligible for a
maximum setback zone.
7.3 The use of volumetric ﬂow equation
The volumetric flow equation is a cost-effective estimation for the rad ius
of influence and is used for wells that pump continuously. It is an alter-
native procedure where aquifer constants are not available and where
the Theis equation cannot be used. The volumetric flow equation 51980 ft 5Å2.433340,000 gpd/ft 31150 min

unconfined nonfractured bedrock aquifers.
Example: A well in Peoria, Illinois (Illinois EPA, 1995), was construc ted in
a sand and gravel deposit which extends from 40 to 130 ft bel ow the land sur-
face. The static water level in the aquifer is 65 ft below the la nd surface.
Because the static water level is below the top of the aquifer, th is would be
considered an unconfined aquifer. The length of the well screen is 4 0 ft. Well
operation records indicate that the pump is operated continuous ly for 30 days
every other month. The normal discharge rate is 1600 gpm (0.10 1 m3/s). Is
the well eligible for a maximum setback zone protection?

1.1 Weight and mass
The weight ( W) of an object, in the International System of Units (SI),
is defined as the product of its mass ( m, in grams, kilograms, etc.) and
the gravitational acceleration ( g/H110059.81 m/s2on the earth’s surface) by
Newton’s second law of motion: F /H11005ma. The weight is expressed as
W/H11005mg (4.1a)
The unit of weight is kg ⋅m/s2and is usually expressed as newton (N).
In the SI system, 1N is defined as the force needed to accelerate 1 kg
of mass at a rate of 1m/s2. Therefore
1N /H110051 kg ⋅ m/s2
/H110051 /H11003 103g ⋅ 102cm/s2
/H11005 105g ⋅ cm/s2
/H11005105dyn
In the US customary units, mass is expressed in slugs. O ne slug is
defined as the mass of an object which needs one pound of force to acc el-
erate to one ft/s2, i.e.
(4.1b)
Example: What is the value of the gravitational acceleration ( g) in the US
customary units?
solution:
g/H110059.81 m/s2 /H110059.81 m/s2 /H110033.28 ft/m
/H1100532.174 ft/s2
Note : This is commonly used as g/H1100532.2 ft/s2.
1.2 Speciﬁc weight
The specific weight (weight per unit volume) of a fluid such as w ater, /H9253,
is defined by the product of the density ( /H9267) and the gravitational accel-
eration ( g), i.e.
/H9253/H11005/H9267g(in kg/m3⋅ m/s2)

g sin slugsd228 Chapter 4Water at 4 /H11034C reaches its maximum density of 1000 kg/m3or 1.000 g/cm3.
The ratio of the specific weight of any liquid to that of water at  4/H11034C is
called the specific gravity of that liquid.
Example: What is the unit weight of water at 4 /H11034C in terms of N/m3and
dyn/cm3?
solution:
Step 1. In N/m3,/H9267/H110051000 kg/m3
/H9253/H11005/H9267g/H110051000 kg/m3/H110039.81 m/s2
/H110059810 N/m3
Step 2. In dyn/cm3,/H9267/H110051.000 g/cm3
/H9253/H110051 g/cm3/H11003981 cm/s2
/H11005981 (g ⋅cm/s2)/cm3
/H11005981 dyn/cm3
1.3 Pressure
Pressure ( P) is the force ( F) applied to or distributed over a surface
area ( A) as a measure of force per unit area:
(4.3a)
In the SI system, the unit of pressure can be expressed as bar ye, bar,
N/m2, or pascal. One barye equals one dyne per square centimeter
(dyn/cm2). The bar is one megabarye, 106dynes per square centime-
ter (106barye). One pascal equals one newton per square meter
(N/m2). In the US customary units, the unit of pressure is express ed
as pounds per square inch, lb/in2(psi), or lb/ft2, etc.
Pressure is also a measure of the height ( h) of the column of mer-
cury, water, or other liquid which it supports. The pressur e at the
liquid surface is atmospheric pressure ( Pa). The pressure at any point
in the liquid is the absolute pressure ( Pab) at that point. The absolute
pressure is measured with respect to zero pressure. Thus, Pabcan be
written as
(4.3b)
where /H9253 /H11005specific weight of water or other liquid.Pab5gh 1 PaP5F
AFundamental and Treatment Plant Hydraulics 229In engineering work, gage pressure is more commonly used. The gag e
pressure scale is designed on the basis that atmospheric pres sure ( Pa)
is zero. Therefore, the gage pressure becomes:
P/H11005 /H9253h (4.3c)
and pressure head
(4.3d)
According to Pascal’s law, the pressure exerted at any point on a con-
fined liquid is transmitted undiminished in all direction s.
Example: Under normal conditions, the atmospheric pressure at sea level
is approximately 760-mm height of mercury. Convert it in term s of m of water,
N/m2, pascals, bars, and psi,
solution:
Step 1. Solve for m of water
Let /H92531and /H92532be specific weights of water and mercury, respectively, and h1
and h2be column heights of water and mercury, respectively; then
approximately
/H92531/H11005 1.00, /H92532/H11005 13.5936
From Eq. (4.3c):
Step 2. Solve for N/m2
Since /H92531/H11005 9810 N/m3

Step 3. Solve for pascals
Since 1 pascal (Pa) /H110051 N/m2, from Step 2:
P/H110051.013 /H11003105N/m2
/H110051.013 /H11003105Pa

1.4 Viscosity of water
All liquids possess a definite resistance to change of their form s, and
many solids show a gradual yielding to force (shear stress) ten ding to
change their forms. Newton’s law of viscosity states that, for a given rate
of angular deformation of liquid, the shear stress is directly propor-
tional to the viscosity. It can be expressed as
(4.4a)
where /H9270 /H11005 shear stress

du/dy /H11005velocity gradient
u /H11005angular velocity
y /H11005depth of fluid
The angular velocity and shear stress change with y.
The viscosity can be expressed as absolute (dynamic) viscosity or kine-
matic viscosity. From Eq. (4.4a), it may be rewritten as
(4.4b)
The viscosity mis frequently referred to as absolute viscosity, or mass
per unit length and time. In the SI system, the absolute vi scosity mis/H92625t

is defined as the tangent shear force ( /H9270) per unit area (dyn/cm2) required
to maintain unit difference in velocity (1 cm/s) between two para llel
planes separated by 1 cm of fluid. It can be written as
or
Also
1 poise /H11005100 centipoise
The usual measure of absolute viscosity of fluid and gas is the cen-
tipoise. The viscosity of fluids is temperature dependent. The visc osity
of water at room temperature (20 /H11034C) is one centipoise. The viscosity of
air at 20 /H11034C is approximately 0.018 centipoise.
The British system unit of viscosity is 1 lb ⋅s/ft2 or 1 slug/ft ⋅s.

density /H9267. It can be written as
/H9263/H11005m//H9267 (4.5)
The dimension of /H9263is length squared per unit time. In the SI system, the
unit of kinematic viscosity is the stoke. One stoke is defined a s 
1 cm2/s. However, the standard measure is the centistoke ( /H1100510/H110022stoke or
10/H110022 cm2/s). Kinematic viscosity offers many applications, such as the
Reynolds number R/H11005 VD//H9263.For water, the absolute viscosity and kine-
matic viscosity are essentially the same, especially when th e tempera-
ture is less than 10 /H11034C. The properties of water in SI units and British units
are respectively given in Tables 4.1a and 4.1b.Fundamental and Treatment Plant Hydraulics 233

A perfect gas is a gas that satisfies the perfect gas laws, s uch as the
Boyle–Mariotte law and the Charles–Gay-Lussac law. It has i nternal
energy as a function of temperature only. It also has specific h eats with
values independent of temperature. The normal volume of a perfect gas
is 22.4136 liters/mole (commonly quoted as 22.4 L/mol).
Boyle’s law states that at a constant temperature, the volum e of a
given quantity of any gas varies inversely as the pressure a pplied ton51.05931025 ft2/sn50.98431026 m2/s3a3.28 ft

Based on empirical generation at constant pressure in a gaseou s
system (perfect gas), when the temperature varies, the volume of gas
will vary approximately in the same proportion. If the volume is exactly
one mole of gas at 0 /H11034C (273.15 K) and at atmosphere pressure, then,
for ideal gases, these are the so-called standard temperature and
pressure, STP. The volume of ideal gas at STP can be calculated fr om
Eq. (4.7) (with R /H110050.08206 L ⋅ atm/K ⋅ mol):
Thus, according to Avogadro’s hypothesis and the ideal-gas equ ation,
one mole of any gas will occupy 22.4l L at STP.
2 Water Flow in Pipes
2.1 Fluid pressure
Water and wastewater professionals frequently encounter some funda-
mentals of hydraulics, such as pressure, static head, pum p head, veloc-
ity of flow, and discharge rate. The total force acting on a cert ain entire
space, commonly expressed as the force acting on unit area, is called
intensity of pressure, or simply pressure, p. The US customary of units
generally uses the pound per square inch (psi) for unit pressur e. This
quantity is also rather loosely referred to simply as pounds p ressure; i.e.
“20 pounds pressure” means 20 psi of pressure. The Internationa l
System of Units uses the kg/cm2(pascal) or g/cm2.
To be technically correct, the pressure is so many pounds or k ilo-
grams more than that exerted by the atmosphere (760 mm of mercur y).
However, the atmospheric pressure is ignored in most cases, sinc e it is
applied to everything and acts uniformly in all directions.V5nRT

The term head is frequently used, such as in energy head, velocity head,
pressure head, elevation head, friction head, pump head, and l oss of head
(head loss). All heads can be expressed in the dimension of length , i.e.
ft /H11003lb/lb /H11005ft, or m /H11003kg/kg /H11005m, etc.
The pump head equals the ft ⋅lb (m ⋅kg) of energy put into each
pound (kg) of water passing through the pump. This will be di scussed
later in the section on pumps.
Pressure drop causes loss of head and may be due to change of veloc-
ity, change of elevation, or friction loss. Hydraulic head loss may occur
at lateral entrances and is caused by hydraulic components  such as
valves, bends, control points, sharp-crested weirs, and orific es. These
types of head loss have been extensively discussed in textbooks an d
handbooks of hydraulics. Bend losses and head losses due to div iding
and combining flows are discussed in detail by James M. Mon tgomery,
Consulting Engineers, Inc. (1985).
Velocity head. The kinetic energy (KE) of water with mass m is its
capacity to do work by reason of its velocity Vand mass and is
expressed as .
For a pipe with mean flow velocity V(m/s or ft/s) and pipe cross-
sectional area A(cm2or sq. in), the total mass of water flowing through
the cross section in unit time is m /H11005/H9267VA, where /H9267is the fluid density.
Thus the total kinetic energy for a pipe flow is
(4.9)
The total weight of fluid W/H11005mg/H11005/H9267AVg, where g is the gravitational
acceleration. It is commonly expressed in terms of energy in a u nit
weight of fluid. The kinetic energy in unit weight of fluid is
(4.10)
This is the so-called velocity head, i.e. the height of the fluid column.

the pressure force on the fluid mass and is expressed as

weight of water or other liquid through friction in the length of a pipe,
in which the energy is converted into heat. The values of friction  heads
are usually obtained from the manufacturer’s tables.

2gFundamental and Treatment Plant Hydraulics 241The head of loss due to friction may be determined in three ways:
1. The friction factor fdepends upon the velocity of flow and the diam-
eter of the pipe. The value of fmay be obtained from a table 
in many hydraulic textbooks and handbooks, or from the Moody
chart (Fig. 4.1) of Reynolds number Rversus ffor various grades and
sizes of pipe R/H11005DV//H9263, where /H9263is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.
2. The friction loss of head hfper 1000 ft of pipe may be determined
from the Hazen-Williams formula for pipe flow. A constant Cfor a
particular pipe, diameter of pipe, and either the velocity or t he
quantity of flow should be known. A nomograph chart is most com -
monly used for solution by the Hazen-Williams formula.
3. Another empirical formula, the Manning equation, is also a  popu-
lar formula for determining head loss due to free flow.
The friction factor fis a function of Reynolds number Rand the rel-
ative roughness of the pipe wall e/D. The value of e(Table 4.2), the
roughness of the pipe wall (equivalent roughness), is usually d eter-
mined from experiment.
For laminar pipe flow ( R< 2000) fis independent of surface rough-
ness of the pipe. The fvalue can be determined from
f/H1100564/R (4.19)
When R> 2000 then the relative roughness will affect the fvalue. The
e/Dvalues can be found from the manufacturer or any textbook. The
relationship between f, R, and e/Dare summarized in graphical expres-
sion as the Moody diagram (Fig. 4.1).242 Chapter 4

Hazen–Williams equation. Due to the difficulty of using the Darcy–
Weisback equation for pipe flow, engineers continue to make use of an  expo-
nential equation with empirical methods for determining fricti on losses in
pipe flows. Among these the empirical formula of the Hazen–Williams
equation is most widely used to express flow relations in pressu re conduits,
while the Manning equation is used for flow relations in free-flow c onduits
and in pipes partially full. The Hazen-Williams equation, orig inally devel-
oped for the British measurement system, has the following form:

The Hazen–Williams equation was developed for water flow in large pi pes
(D /H113502 in, 5 cm) with a moderate range of velocity (V /H1134910 ft/s or 3 m/s).
The coefficient of roughness Cvalues range from 140 for very smooth
(new), straight pipe to 90 or 80 for old, unlined tuberculated pipe. The
value of 100 is used for the average conditioned pipe. It is not a function
of the flow condition (i.e. Reynolds number R). The major limitation of this
equation is that the viscosity and temperature are considered.  A nomo-
graph (Fig. 4.2) can be used to solve the Hazen-Williams equation.R5A

runoff of 0.6 ft3/s /H11080acre (0.0069 m3/s ⋅ha), and the rest of the area has a
runoff of 0.4 ft3/s /H11080acre (0.0046 m3/s. ha). Determine the size of pipe needed
to carry the storm flow with a grade of 0.12% and n/H110050.011.

There are three major types of compound piping system: pipes con-
nected in series, in parallel, and branching. Pipes in par allel occur in a
pipe network when two or more paths are available for water flowin g
between two points. Pipe branching occurs when water can flow t o or
from a junction of three or more pipes from independent outlets or
sources. On some occasions, two or more sizes of pipes may be connect ed
in series between two reservoirs. Figure 4.5 illustrates all th ree cases.
The flow through a pipeline consisting of three or more pipes connect ed
in various ways can be analyzed on the basis of head loss conc ept with
two basic conditions. First, at a junction, water flows in and out should
be the same. Second, all pipes meeting at the junction have th e same water
pressure at the junction. The general procedures are to apply th e Bernoulli
energy equation to determine the energy line and hydraulic grad ient
mainly from friction head loss equations. In summary, using  Fig. 4.5:

4258 Chapter 4not suitable for the more complex cases of networks. A trial and er ror
procedure should be used. The most widely used is the loop method
originally proposed by Hardy Cross in 1936. Another method, t he nodal
method, was proposed by Cornish in 1939 (Chadwick and Morfett , 1986).
For analysis flows in a network of pipes, the following conditions
must be satisfied:
1. The algebraic sum of the pressure drops around each circuit must
be zero.
2. Continuity must be satisfied at all junctions; i.e. infl ow equals out-
flow at each junction.
3. Energy loss must be the same for all paths of water.
Using the continuity equation at a node, this gives
(4.23)
where m is the number of pipes joined at the node. The sign conven-
tionally used for flow into a joint is positive, and outflow is negative.
Applying the energy equation to a loop, we get
(4.24)
where nis the number of pipes in a loop. The sign for flow ( qi) and head
loss ( hfi) is conventionally positive when clockwise.
Since friction loss is a function of flow

Method of equivalent pipes. In a complex pipe system, small loops within
the system are replaced by single hydraulically equivalent pipes. This
method can also be used for determination of diameter and length of a
replacement pipe; i.e. one that will produce the same head loss as the
old one.

Hardy–Cross method. The Hardy–Cross method (1936) of network analy-
sis is a loop method which eliminates the head losses from Eqs.  (4.24)
and (4.25) and generates a set of discharge equations. The basic s of the
method are:
1. Assume a value for Qifor each pipe to satisfy /H9018Qi/H110050.
2. Compute friction losses hfifrom Qi; find Sfrom Hazen–Williams
equation.
3. If the solution is correct.
4. If apply a correction factor /H9004Qto all Qi, then repeat step 1.
5. A reasonable value of /H9004Qis given by Chadwick and Morfett (1986)
(4.26)
This trial and error procedure solved by digital computer prog ram is
available in many textbooks on hydraulics (Hwang 1981, Str eeter and
Wylie 1975).
The nodal method. The basic concept of the nodal method consists of
the elimination of discharges from Eqs. (4.23) and (4.25) to gener ate
a set of head loss equations. This method may be used for loops or
branches when the external heads are known and the heads with in
the networks are needed. The procedure of the nodal method is as
follows:
1. Assume values of the head loss Hjat each junction.
2. Compute Qifrom Hj.
3. If /H9018Qi/H110050, the solution is correct.
4. If /H9018Qi/HS110050, adjust a correction factor /H9004Hto Hj, then repeat step 2.

To estimate every loss in a pipe carrying sludge, the Hazen–Wil liams
equation with a modified Cvalue and a graphic method based on field
experience are commonly used. The modified Cvalues for various total

2.6 Dividing-ﬂow manifolds and multiport diffusers
The related subjects of dividing-flow manifolds and multiport di ffusers
are discussed in detail by Benefield et al. (1984). They present basic the-
ories and excellent design examples for these two subjects. In ad dition,
there is a design example of hydraulic analysis for all unit  processes of
a wastewater treatment plant.
3 Pumps
3.1 Types of pump
The centrifugal pump and the displacement pump are most commonly
used for water and wastewater works. Centrifugal pumps have a rotating
impeller which imparts energy to the water. Displacement pumps are oft en
of the reciprocating type in which a piston draws water or slurry int o a closed
chamber and then expels it under pressure. Reciprocating pumps are wid ely
used to transport sludge in wastewater treatment plants. Air-lift pu mps,
jet pumps, and hydraulic rams are also used in special applicati ons.
3.2 Pump performance
The Bernoulli equation may be applied to determine the total dyna mic
head on the pump. The energy equation expressing the head between
the suction(s) and discharge(d) nozzles of the pumps is as follows:

The power output ( Po /H11005QrH for SI units) of a pump is the work
done to lift the water to a higher elevation per unit time. The th eo-
retical power output or horsepower (hp) required is a function of a
known discharge and total pump lift. For US customary unit s, it may
be written as

Conversely, 1 kW /H110051.341 hp
The actual horsepower needed is determined by dividing the the-
oretical horsepower by the efficiency of the pump and driving uni t.
The efficiencies for centrifugal pumps normally range from 50% to
85%. The efficiency increases with the size and capacity of the
pump.
The design of a pump should consider total dynamic head which
includes differences in elevations. The horsepower which should be
delivered to a pump is determined by dividing Eq. (4.28b) by  the pump
efficiency, as follows:

The cost of pumping through a pipeline is a function of head loss , flow
rate, power cost, and the total efficiency of the pump system. It  can be
expressed as (ductile Iron Pipe Research Association, 1997)

Example: Water is pumped at a rate of 6300 gal/min (0.40 m3/s) through a
24-in pipeline of 10,000 ft (3048 m) length. The actual inside diameters for
ductile iron pipe and PVC pipe are respectively 24.95 and 22 .76 in. Assume
the unit power cost is $0.058/kWh; the total efficiency of pump system is
75%; the pump is operated 24 h per day. Estimate: (a) the cost  of pumping for
each kind of pipeline, (b) the present value of the difference of pumpin g cost,

This velocity is between 2 and 10 ft/s; it is thus suitabl e for a storm sewer.
4.3 Partially ﬁlled conduit
The conditions of partially filled conduit are frequently encounter ed in
environmental engineering, particularly in the case of sewer li nes. In a
conduit flowing partly full, the fluid is at atm pressure a nd the flow is
the same as in an open channel. The Manning equation (Eq. (4.2 2)) is
applied.
A schematic pipe cross section is shown in Fig. 4.7. The angl e /H9258, flow

duit, a chart is generally used which is available in h ydraulic textbooks

solution: These questions are frequently encountered in sewer design engi-
neering. In the partially filled conduit, the wastewater is at atm pr essure and
the flow is the same as in an open channel, which can be determined with t he
Manning equation (Eq. (4.22)). Since this is inconvenient for mathematic al cal-
culation, a chart (Fig. 4.4) is commonly used for calculating area A, hydraulic
radius R, and flow Qfor actual values (partly filled), as opposed to full-flow

Sewers flowing between 50% and 80% full need not be placed on
steeper grades to be as self-cleansing as sewers flowing full. The r eason
is that velocity and discharge are functions of attractive for ce which
depends on the friction coefficient and flow velocity (Fair et al. 1966).
Figure 4.8 presents the hydraulic elements of circular sewers t hat pos-
sess equal self-cleansing effect.
Using Fig. 4.8, the slope for a given degree of self-cleansing of par tly
full pipes can be determined. Applying Eq. (4.41) with the M anning

The quantity is dimensionless. It is the so-called Froude number ,
F. The Froude number is a very important factor for open channel flow.
It relates three states of flow as follows:
F Velocity Flow state

< 1 subcritical ( V< speed of surface wave)
> 1 supercritical ( V> speed of surface wave)
Example: Determine the critical depth of a channel when the water is flow -

When water flows in an open channel, an abrupt decrease in veloc ity
may occur due to a sudden increase of water depth in the downst ream
direction. This is called hydraulic jump and may be a na tural phenom-
enon. It occurs when the depth in an open channel increases from  a
depth less than the critical depth Dcto one greater than Dc. Under these
conditions, the water must pass through a hydraulic jump , as shown in
Fig. 4.11.
The balance between the hydraulic forces P1and P2, represented by
the two triangles and the momentum flux through sections 1 an d 2, per
unit width of the channel, can be expressed as
P1/H11002P2/H11005/H9267q(V2/H11002V1) (4.52)
where qis the flow rate per unit width of the channel. Substituting  the

hydraulic jump in a rectangular channel may be calcula ted by the equation

5 Flow Measurements
Flow can be measured by velocity methods and direct discharge meth-
ods. The measurement flow velocity can be carried out by a curren t
meter, Pitot tube, U-tube, dye study, or salt velocity. Discha rge is the
product of measured mean velocity and cross-sectional area. Direc t
discharge methods include volumetric gravimeter, Venturi meter , pipe
orifice meter, standardized nozzle meter, weirs, orifices, gates,
Parshall flumes, etc. Detail flow measurements in orifices, gates ,
tubes, weirs, pipes, and in open channals are discussed by  Brater 
et al. (1996).
5.1 Velocity measurement in open channel
The mean velocity of a stream or a channel can be measured with a cur-
rent meter. A variety of current meters is commercially availab le. An
example of discharge calculation with known mean velocity in sub-cross
section is presented in Chapter 1.
5.2 Velocity measurement in pipe ﬂow
Pitot tube. A Pitot tube is bent to measure velocity due to the pressure
difference between the two sides of the tube in a flow system. The flow
velocity can be determined from

5.3 Discharge measurement of water ﬂow in pipes
Direct collection of volume (or weight) of water discharged from a pi pe
divided by time of collection is the simplest and most reliabl e method.
However, in most cases it cannot be done by this method. A chang e of
pressure head is related to a change in flow velocity caused by  a sudden
change of pipe cross-sectional geometry. Venturi meters, nozzle meters,
and orifice meters use this concept.
Venturi meter. A Venturi meter is a machine-cased section of pipe with
a narrow throat. The device, in a short cylindrical section,  consists of
an entrance cone and a diffuser cone which expands to full pipe diam-
eter. Two piezometric openings are installed at the entrance (secti on 1)
and at the throat (section 2). When the water passes through th e
throat, the velocity increases and the pressure decreases. The dec rease
of pressure is directly related to the flow. Using the Bernoulli equa-
tion at sections 1 and 2, neglecting friction head loss, it can be seen
that

Nozzle meter and oriﬁce meter. The nozzle meter and the orifice meter
are based on the same principles as the Venturi meter. However, n ozzle
and orifice meters encounter a significant loss of head due to a n ozzle
or orifice installed in the pipe. The coefficient ( Cv) for the nozzle meter
or orifice meter is added to the discharge equation for the Venturi  meter,
and needs to be determined by on-site calibration. The discharge for the
nozzle meter and orifice meter is
(4.60)
or, for horizontal installation
(4.61)
The nozzle geometry has been standardized by the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and the International Standards
Association. The nozzle coefficient Cvis a function of Reynolds number
(R/H11005V2d2//H9263) and ratio of diameters ( d2/d1). A nomograph (Fig. 4.12) 
is available. Values of Cvrange from 0.96 to 0.995 for Rranging from 
5 /H11003104to 5 /H11003106.

Parshall ﬂume. The Parshall flume was developed by R. L. Parshall in
1920 for the British measurement system. It is widely used for  meas-
uring the flow rate of an open channel. It consists of a convergi ng sec-
tion, a throat section, and a diverging section. The bottom of t he throat
section is inclined downward and the bottom of the diverging s ection is
inclined upward. The dimensions of the Parshall flume are specifi ed in
the British system, not the metric system. The geometry creates a crit-
ical depth to occur near the beginning of the throat section an d also gen-
erates a back water curve that allows the depth Hato be measured from
observation well a. There is a second measuring point Hblocated at the
downstream end of the throat section. The ratio of Hbto Hais defined
as the submergence of the flume.
Discharge is a function of Ha. The discharge equation of a Parshall
flume is determined by its throat width, which ranges from 3  in to 50 ft.
The relationship between the empirical discharge and the gage r eading
Hafor various sizes of flume is given below:
Throat width W, ft Discharge equation, ft3/s Flow capacity, ft3/s

10–50 ft Q/H11005(3.6875 W/H110012.5) 
SOURCE : R. L. Parshall (1926)
When the ratio of Hato Hbexceeds the following values:
0.5 for flumes of 1, 2, and 3 in width,
0.6 for flumes of 6 and 9 in width,
0.7 for flumes of 1 to 8 ft width,
0.8 for flumes of 8 to 50 ft width.
The flume is said to be submerged. When a flume is submerged, the
actual discharge is less than that determined by the above equations.

rection for the 1-ft flume can be applicable to larger flumes by m ultiplying
by a correction factor of 1.0, 1.4, 1.8, 2.4, 3.1, 4.3, an d 5.4 for flume sizes
of 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 ft width, respectively. Figur e 4.16 is used for
determining the correction to be subtracted from the free-flow value for
a 10-ft Parshall flume. For larger sizes, the correction equals th e value
from the diagram multiplied by the size factor M. Figures. 4.13–4.16

1 Sources and Quantity of Water
The sources of a water supply may include rainwater, surface w aters,
and groundwater. During the water cycle, rainwater recharg es the sur-
face waters and groundwater. River, stream, natural pond, i mpoundment,
reservoir, and lake waters are major surface water sources. Some com-
munities use groundwater, such as galleries, wells, aquifers , and springs
as their water supply sources.
Water supplies may be drawn from a single source or from a num ber
of different ones. The water from multiple sources could be mixed
before distribution or separately distributed. Any new source w ater
has to be approved by the federal, state, and related authoriti es. The
quantity of water needed varies with season, geography, size and  type
of community, and culture. A water supply system may provid e for
domestic, industrial and commercial, public services, ﬁre demands,
unaccounted losses as well as farm uses. The design ﬂow for a wa ter
supply system is discussed in the sections of water requiremen ts and
ﬁre demands. The design engineers should examine the availabili ties308 Chapter 5of water sources and quantities in the area. The prediction of th e
nature population should be made for design purpose. Based on lon g-
term meteorological data, the amount of water stored in the lake or
reservoirs can be estimated.
Runoff refers to the precipitation that reaches a stream or river.
Theoretically, every unit volume of water passing the observation
station should be measured and the sum of all these units pas sing in
a certain period of time would be the total runoff. However, it is n ot
available due to cost. Observations should be carried out at reason-
ably close intervals so that the observed flow over a long period of time
is the sum of flows for the individual shorter periods of observati on
and not the sum of the observed rates of flow multiplied by the tot al
period.
Example 1: Records of observations during a month (30 days) period
show that a flow rate 2.3 cfs (0.065 m3/s) for 8 days, 3.0 cfs (0.085 m3/s) for
10 days, 56.5 cfs (16.0 m3/s) for 1 day, 12.5 cfs (0.354 m3/s) for 2 days, 5.3 cfs
(0.150 m3/s) for 6 days, and 2.65 cfs (0.075 m3/s) for 3 days. What is the
mean flow rate?

a few methods have been used for forecasting population. They includ e the

This method of forecasting is based upon the hypothesis that the rate
of increase is constant. It may be expressed as follows:
(5.1)
where p/H11005population
t/H11005time, year
ka/H11005arithmetic growth rate constant
Rearrange and integrate the above equation, p1and p2are the popula-
tions at time t1and t2, respectively.
We get

pt/H11005p0 /H11001kat (5.2b)
where pt/H11005population at future time
p0/H11005present population, usually use p2(recent censused)
2.2 Constant percentage growth rate method
The hypothesis of constant percentage or geometric growth rate assu mes
that the rate increase is proportional to population. It can be written as
(5.3a)
Integrating this equation yields

2.3 Declining growth method
This is a decreasing rate of increase on the basis that the gr owth rate
is a function of its population deﬁcit. Mathematically it i s given as

The logistic curve-ﬁtting method is used for modeling population trends
with an S-shape for large population center, or nations for long-t erm
population predictions. The logistic curve form is

Substitution of these values in Eq. (5.5a) gives the estimation  of future
population on Pfor any period ∆tbeyond the base year corresponding
to P0.
Example: A mid size city recorded populations of 113,000 and 129,000 i n the
April 1980 and April 1990 census, respectively. Estimat e the population in
January 1999 by comparing (a) arithmetic method, (b) constan t percentage

3 Water Requirements
The uses of water include domestic, commercial and industrial,  public
services such as ﬁre ﬁghting and public buildings, and  unaccounted
pipeline system losses and leakage. The average usage in the Uni ted
States for the above four categories are 220, 260, 30, and 90L p er capita
per day (L/(c ⋅d)), respectively (Tchobanoglous and Schroeder 1985).
These correspond to 58, 69, 8, and 24 gal/(c ⋅d), respectively. Total munic-
ipal water use averages 600 L/(c ⋅ d) or 160 gal/(c ⋅ d) in the United States.
The maximum daily water use ranges from about 120% to 400% of th e
average daily use with a mean of about 180%. Maximum hourly use is
about 150% to 12,000% of the annual average daily ﬂow; and 25 0% to
270% are typically used in design.
3.1 Fire demand
Fire demand of water is often the determining factor in the design of
mains. Distribution is a short-term, small quantity but  with a large
ﬂow rate. According to uniform ﬁre code, the minimum ﬁre ﬂow req uire-
ment for a one- and two-family dwelling shall be 1000 gal per m in (gpm).
For the water demand for ﬁre ﬁghting based on downtown business
districts and high-value area for communities of 200,000 peopl e or less,
the National Board of Fire Underwriters (1974) recommended the fol-
lowing ﬁre ﬂow rate and population relationship:

The required ﬂow rate for ﬁre ﬁghting must be available in add ition
to the coincident maximum daily ﬂow rate. The duration durin g the
required ﬁre ﬂow must be available for 4 to 10 h. National Boa rd of Fire
Underwriters recommends providing for a 10-h ﬁre in towns exceedi ng

Fire ﬂow tests. Fire ﬂow tests involve discharging water at a known
ﬂow rate from one or more hydrants and examining the correspondin g
pressure drop from the main through another nearby hydrant. Th e
discharge from a hydrant nozzle can be determined as follows

3.2 Leakage test
After a new main is installed, a leakage test is usually required. The tes t-
ing is generally carried out for a pipe length not exceeding 300 m (1000 ft).
The pipe is ﬁlled with water and pressurized (50% above normal op er-
ation pressure) for at least 30 min. The leakage limit recommended  by
the American Water Work Association is determined as:

4 Regulations for Water Quality
Water quality is a term used to describe the physical, chem ical, and bio-
logical characteristics of water with respect to its suitab ility for a par-
ticular use. In the United States, all federal drinking wa ter standards
are set under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).
4.1 Safe drinking water act
The Safe Drinking Water Act  was originally passed by the C ongress in
1974. The SDWA gives the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA )
the authority to set drinking water standards to protect pu blic health
by regulating public drinking water supply. It was am ended in 1986
(interim) and 1996. 
There are two categories of federal drinking water standards: Nat ional
Primary Drinking Water Regulations (Table 5.1) and National  Secondary
Drinking Water Regulations (Table 5.1a). The Maximum Contami nant
Level Goals (MCLGs) for chemicals suspected or known to cause cancer
in humans are set to zero. If a chemical is carcinogenic and a safe dose
is determined, the MCLG is set at a level above zero that is safe.  For
microbial concentrations ( Giardia, Legionella, TC, FC, E. coli, and
ciruses ) the MCLGs are set at zero.
The SDWA regulates every public water supply in the United St ates
(160,000 plants) with some variances and does not apply to w ater systems
that serve fewer than 25 individuals. The SDWA established a multiple
barrier protection for drinking water. It starts watershed m anagement
to protect drinking water as well as its water sources (lakes , reservoirs,
rivers, streams, springs, and groundwater). It also requir es assessing
and protecting collection systems, properly treated by qualiﬁ ed operators,
the integrity of the distribution systems, monitoring for the r egulated and
unregulated contaminants, providing information available t o the public
on the drinking water quality, and submitting the requir ed operational
reports to the state EPA. The state EPA is responsible for enforcement ,
technical assistances, granting variances, and even ﬁnan cial assistancePublic Water Supply 321TABLE 5.1 National Primary Drinking Water Regulations

NOTES
1Deﬁnitions:
Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)—The highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in
drinking water. MCLs are set as close to MCLGs as feasible using the best available treatment
technology and taking cost into consideration. MCLs are enforceable stan dards.
Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG)—The level of a contaminant in drinking water
below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MCLGs allow for a margin of safety
and are nonenforceable public health goals.
Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level (MRDL)—The highest level of a disinfectant allow ed
in drinking water. There is convincing evidence that addition of a disinfec tant is necessary for
control of microbial contaminants.330 Chapter 5Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level Goal (MRDLG)—The level of a drinking water
disinfectant below which there is no known or expected risk to health. M RDLGs do not reﬂect
the beneﬁts of the use of disinfectants to control microbial contaminants.
Treatment Technique—A required process intended to reduce the level of a cont aminant in
drinking water.
2Units are in milligrams per liter (mg/L) unless otherwise noted. Milligrams per  liter are
equivalent to parts per million.
3EPA’s surface water treatment rules require systems using surfac e water or groundwater
under the direct inﬂuence of surface water to: (1) disinfect their water,  and (2) ﬁlter their water
or meet criteria for avoiding ﬁltration so that the following contaminants are controlled at the
following levels:
■Cryptosporidium :(as of 1/1/02 for systems serving >10,000 and 1/14/05 for syst ems serving
<10,000) 99% removal. 
■Giardia lamblia: 99.9% removal/inactivation. 
■Viruses: 99.99% removal/inactivation. 
■Legionella : No limit, but EPA believes that if Giardia and viruses are removed/inactivated,
Legionella will also be controlled. 
■Turbidity: At no time can turbidity (cloudiness of water) go above 5 n ephelolometric turbidity
units (NTU); systems that ﬁlter must ensure that the turbidity go no higher than 1 NTU
(0.5 NTU for conventional or direct ﬁltration) in at least 95% of the daily sa mples in any
month. As of January 1, 2002, turbidity may never exceed 1 NTU, and must not exceed 
0.3 NTU in 95% of daily samples in any month. 
■HPC: No more than 500 bacterial colonies per milliliter. 
■Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment (Effective Date: Janua ry 14, 2005): Surface
water systems or (GWUDI) systems serving fewer than 10,000 people mu st comply with the
applicable Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule provision s (e.g. turbidity
standards, individual ﬁlter monitoring, Cryptosporidium removal requir ements, updated
watershed control requirements for unﬁltered systems). 
■Filter Backwash Recycling: The Filter Backwash Recycling Rule requires s ystems 
that recycle to return specific recycle flows through all processes of the system’s 
existing conventional or direct ﬁltration system or at an alternate loca tion approved by
the state.
4More than 5.0% samples total coliform-positive in a month. (For water syst ems that collect
fewer than 40 routine samples per month, no more than one sample can  be total coliform-
positive per month.) Every sample that has total coliform must be ana lyzed for either fecal
coliforms or E. coli if two consecutive TC-positive samples, and one is also positive for E.coli fecal
coliforms, system has an acute MCL violation. 
5Fecal coliform and E. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be
contaminated with human or animal wastes. Disease-causing microbes (pathogens) in these
wastes can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or oth er symptoms. These pathogens
may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, and people with severely compromised
immune systems.
6Although there is no collective MCLG for this contaminant group, there a re individual MCLGs
for some of the individual contaminants:
■Trihalomethanes: Bromodichloromethane (zero); bromoform (zero); dibromochloromethane
(0.06 mg/L). Chloroform is regulated with this group but has no MCLG . 
■Haloacetic acids: Dichloroacetic acid (zero); trichloroacetic acid (0.3 mg/L). Monochloroacetic
acid, bromoacetic acid, and dibromoacetic acid are regulated with th is group but have no
MCLGs. 
7MCLGs were not established before the 1986 Amendments to the Safe Drink ing Water Act.
Therefore, there is no MCLG for this contaminant.
8Lead and copper are regulated by a treatment technique that requir es systems to control the
corrosiveness of their water. If more than 10% of tap water samples exc eed the action level,
water systems must take additional steps. For copper, the action lev el is 1.3 mg/L, and for lead
is 0.015 mg/L.
9Each water system must certify, in writing, to the state (using third-party or manufacturer’s
certiﬁcation) that when acrylamide and epichlorohydrin are used in dr inking water systems,
the combination (or product) of dose and monomer level does not exceed the levels speciﬁed, as
follows:
■Acrylamide = 0.05% dosed at 1 mg/L (or equivalent) 
■Epichlorohydrin = 0.01% dosed at 20 mg/L (or equivalent)

the uses of lead pipes, lead solder, and lead ﬂux.
Under the SDWA, the National Drinking Water Contaminant
Candidate List (CCL) originally published on March 2, 1998 that listed
60 contaminants (50 chemicals or chemical groups and 10 m icrobial
contaminants). The SDWA also requires the US EPA to review each p ri-
mary standard at least once every 6 years for revision if needed.  On April
2, 2004, the US EPA listed 50 contaminants (41 chemicals or chemical
groups plus 9 microbials) as a draft CCL2. 
How MCLGs are developed. MCLGs are set at concentration levels at
which no known or anticipated adverse health effects would occur , allow-
ing for an adequate margin of safety. Establishment of a speciﬁ c MCLG
depends on the evidence of carcinogenicity from drinking water exp o-
sure or the US EPA’s reference dose (RfD), which is calculated for each
speciﬁc contaminant. The drinking water standards are devel oped as fol-
lows (Federal Register, 1991).
The RfD is an estimate, with an uncertainty spanning perha ps an
order of magnitude of a daily exposure to the human population (in clud-
ing sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an ap preciable risk
of deleterious health effects during a lifetime. The RfD is derived from
a no- or lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (called a NOAEL or LOAEL,
respectively) that has been identiﬁed from a subchronic or chron ic sci-
entiﬁc study of humans or animals. The NOAEL or LOAEL is then
divided by the uncertainty factor to derive the RfD.332 Chapter 5

NOTE : National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations (NSDWRs or secondary st andards)
are non-enforceable guidelines regulating contaminants that may cause c osmetic effects
(such as skin or tooth discoloration) or aesthetic effects (such as tast e, odor, or color) in
drinking water. EPA recommends secondary standards to water sy stems but does not require
systems to comply. However, states may choose to adopt them as enforc eable standards.
SOURCE : US EPA, 2000The use of an uncertainty factor is important in the derivation  of the
RfD. The US EPA has established certain guidelines (shown below) to
determine which uncertainty factor should be used:
10—Valid experimental results for appropriate duration of human
exposure.
100—Human data not available. Extrapolation from valid long-t erm
animal studies.
1000—Human data not available. Extrapolation from animal st ud-
ies of less than chronic exposure.
1 to 10—Additional safety factor for use of a LOAEL instead of a NOA EL.
Other—Other uncertainty factors are used according to scientiﬁ c
judgment when justiﬁed. 
In general, an uncertainly factor is calculated to consider intra- and inter-
species variations, limited or incomplete data, use of subchron ic studies,
signiﬁcance of the adverse effect, and the pharmacokinetic factors .
From the RfD, a drinking water equivalent level (DWEL) is calcul ated
by multiplying the RfD by an assumed adult body weight (g enerally 70 kg)
and then dividing by an average daily water consumption of 2 L/d. The
DWEL assumes the total daily exposure to a substance is from dr inking
water exposure. The MCLG is determined by multiplying the DWEL b y
the percentage of the total daily exposure contributed by drinki ng water,
called the relative source contribution. Generally, EPA assumes  that the
relative source contribution from drinking water is 20% of the t otal expo-
sure, unless other exposure data for the chemical are available.  The cal-
culation below expresses the derivation of the MCLG:

For chemicals suspected as carcinogens, the assessment for nonth reshold
toxicants consists of the weight of evidence of carcinogenicity in  humans,
using bioassays in animals and human epidemiological stu dies as well as
information that provides indirect evidence (i.e. mutagenicity and other
short-term test results). The objectives of the assessment are (1) to
determine the level or strength of evidence that the substance is a
human or animal carcinogen and (2) to provide an upper-bound es timateDWEL5NOAEL or LOAEL 3 body weight, kg

of the possible risk of human exposure to the substance in dri nking water.
A summary of US EPA’s carcinogen classiﬁcation scheme is:
Group A—Human carcinogen based on sufﬁcient evidence for epi-
demiological studies.
Group B1—Probable human carcinogen based on at least limited ev i-
dence of carcinogenicity to humans.
Group B2—Probable human carcinogen based on a combination of suf-
ﬁcient evidence in animals and inadequate data in humans.
Group C—Possible human carcinogen based on limited evidence of
carcinogenicity in animals in the absence of human data.
Group D—Not classiﬁable due to lack of data or inadequate eviden ce
of carcinogenicity from animal data.
Group E—No evidence of carcinogenicity for humans (no evidence for
carcinogenicity in at lease two adequate animal tests in di fferent
species or in both epidemiological and animal studies).
Establishing the MCLG for a chemical is generally accomplis hed in
one of three ways depending upon its categorization (Table 5.2). The
starting point in EPA’s analysis is the EPA’s cancer c lassiﬁcation (i.e. A,
B, C, D, or E). Each chemical is analyzed for evidence.
EPA’s policy is to set MCLGs for Category I contaminants at zero. The
MCLG for Category II contaminants is calculated by using t he
RfD/DWEL with an added margin of safety to account for cancer effect s,
or is based on a cancer risk range of 10/H110025to 10/H110026when noncancer data
are inadequate for deriving an RfD. The MCLG for Category III con-
taminants is calculated using the RfD/DWEL approach.
The MCLG for Category I contaminants is set at zero because it is
assumed, in the absence of other data, that there is no known t hresh-
old. Category I contaminants are those contaminants for whic h EPA has
determined that there is strong evidence of carcino genicity from drinking
TABLE 5.2 EPA’s Three /H11002Category Approach for Establishing MCLGs

water ingestion. If there is no additional information to consid er on
potential cancer risk from drinking water ingestion, chemica ls classi-
ﬁed as A or B carcinogens are placed in Category I.
Category II contaminants include those contaminants for whic h EPA
has determined that there is limited evidence, pharmacokinetic s, and
exposure. If there is no additional information to consider on poten tial
cancer risks from drinking water ingestion, chemicals clas siﬁed by the
Agency as Group C carcinogens are placed in Category II. For Category
II contaminants, two approaches are used to set the MCLGs—either 
(1) setting the goal based upon noncarcinogenic endpoints (the RfD )
and then applying an additional uncertainty (safety) factor of up to 10
or (2) setting the goals based upon a normal lifetime cancer ris k calcu-
lation in the range of 10/H110025to 10/H110026, using a conservative calculation
model. The ﬁrst approach is generally used. However, the second is
used when valid noncarcinogenicity data are not available a nd ade-
quate experimental data are available to quantify the cancer risk. EPA
is currently evaluating the approach to establishing MCLGs  for
Category II contaminants.
Category III contaminants include those contaminants for whi ch there
is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity via ingestion. If ther e is no
additional information to consider, contaminants classiﬁed a s Group D
or E carcinogens are placed in Category III. For these contamin ants, the
MCLG is established using the RfD approach.
Maximum contamination level or treatment technique. Once the MCLG is
deﬁned, the US EPA sets an enforceable standard. In most cases,  it is
as maximum contamination level (MCL). The MCL is the maximum
permissible concentration of a contaminant in water that is delivered
to any user of a public water system. The MCL is set as close t o the
MCLG as feasible that the contaminant level may be achieved wi th the
use of the best available technology, treatment techniques, and other
means of corrections and improvement.
If there is no reliable method that is technically and economic ally
feasible to measure a contaminant at particularly low levels,  a TT (treat-
ment technique) is set rather than an MCL. The TT is an enforceabl e
procedure or level of technical performance that public water trea tment
systems must follow to ensure control of a contaminant.
The US EPA must conduct a cost-beneﬁt analysis, after MCL or TT
is determined. Based on the results of the cost-beneﬁt analysis, the US
EPA may justify any variances and exemptions from standards  for some
water utilities.
The SDWA required the US EPA to review each primary standard a t
least once every 6 years for revision if needed. The primary standa rds
went onto effect 6 years after they were ﬁnalized. 336 Chapter 5
4.2 Two major rules updated in 2006
Over the past 8 years, the US EPA has worked collaboratively with
stakeholders to develop regulations that will provide a balanc e between
the needs to disinfect drinking water and to protect citizens fr om poten-
tially harmful contaminants. Two of the most recent major rul es ﬁnal-
ized and published in 2006 are:
1. The Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection By-products Rule (Stage 2
DBP rule or DBPR, Stage 2). 
2. The Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (LT2 rule
or LT2ESWTR).
More information about the US EPA drinking water regulations c an be
found at www.epa.gov/OGWDW/regs.html. This site, developed by th e
EPA’s Ofﬁce of Ground Water and Drinking Water, lists curr ent drink-
ing water rules, proposed rules, the code of federal regulations, d rink-
ing water standards, and a wealth of other information, such  as fact
sheets, guidance manuals, and more. Moorman (2006) summarized infor-
mation below from various EPA documents helping to understand t he
immediate requirements and the overall purposes of these two new ru les.
Cryptosporidium has caused serious disease outbreak and are resist-
ant to traditional water disinfection practices. Consumption  of water
that contains Cryptosporidium can cause gastrointestinal illness that
can be fatal for people with weakened immune systems. In additi on,
water chlorination can react with naturally occurring org anic matters
to form disinfection by-products (DBPs), which also pose health con cerns.
To respond to these new threats, amendments to the SDWA in 1996
require the US EPA to develop rules to balance the risks between
pathogens and DBPs. As the ﬁrst phase of this requirement, th e Stage 1
Disinfectants and Disinfection By-products Rule (Stage 1 DBP r ule) was
promulgated in December 1998 to reduce exposure to DBPs for customer s
of community water systems and nontransient noncommunity sys tems,
including those serving fewer than 10,000 people, that add a  disinfectant
to the drinking water during any part of the treatment proces s.
The Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (IESWTR) was
also promulgated in December 1998, but this rule was made t o improve con-
trol of microbial contaminants, particularly Cryptosporidium, in systems
using surface water, or groundwater under the direct inﬂuence (GWUDI)
of surface water, that serve 10,000 or more persons. As the smal l-system
counterpart to the IESWTR, the Long Term 1 Enhanced Surface Water
Treatment Rule was ﬁnalized in January 2002 and strengthen s control of
microbial contaminants for systems serving fewer than 10,000  people.
The Stage 2 DBP rule. The Stage 2 DBP rule building upon the Stage 1
DBP rule was published in the Federal Register on January 4, 2006. ThisPublic Water Supply 337
rule is intended to reduce potential cancer and reproductive an d devel-
opmental health risks from DBPs in drinking water through m ore strin-
gent methods for determining compliance.
Requirements. Under the Stage 2 DBP rule, community and nontran-
sient noncommunity water systems that add and/or deliver wa ter that
is treated with a primary or residual disinfectant other th an ultravio-
let light must conduct an evaluation of their distribution systems, called
an Initial Distribution System Evaluation (IDSE), to ident ify locations
with high DBP concentrations. These locations must then be used  by the
systems as the sampling sites for Stage 2 DBP rule complianc e moni-
toring. The rule requires two steps for the IDSE. First, the sys tem must
develop a plan of how they will approach the IDSE. There are four
options: a very small system waiver, 40/30 certiﬁcation, s tandard mon-
itoring program (SMP), and system speciﬁc study (SSS). This p lan must
be submitted to the state or primary agency with proposed DBP moni-
toring sites. After receiving approval, the system must condu ct the IDSE
with 1 year of DBP monitoring if the standard option is used.
Compliance with the MCLs for trihalomethanes (THMs) and ﬁve
haloacetic acids (HAA5) will be calculated as an average at each compli-
ance-monitoring location (instead of as a system-wide average as  in pre-
vious rules). This approach is referred to as the locational run ning
annual average (LRAA).
The Stage 2 DBP rule also establishes operational evaluation level s. A
system that exceeds this level must conduct an operational eva luation 
(a review of operational practices) to determine ways to reduce DBP c on-
centrations. This provides an early warning of possible future MCL viola-
tions, and allows the system to take proactive steps to remain  in compliance.
The Stage 2 DBP rule and the LT2 rule are the second phase of rules
required by the Congress to help balance the risks between path ogens
and DBPs. These rules strengthen protection against microbial con-
taminants, especially Cryptosporidium, and at the same time, reduce
potential health risks of DBPs.
Time frame. The time frame of the Stage 2 DBP rule is a multiyear
process for water systems to determine where higher levels of DBPs occ ur
in their distribution systems. These locations will become the new DBP
monitoring sites, and corrective action will be taken if DBP l evels are
above the MCL. These actions could include small operational cha nges
up to major facility construction. Depending on system size an d the extent
of needed construction, systems will begin the ﬁrst year of compl iance
monitoring between 2012 and 2015, and must be in complianc e with the
Stage 2 DBP rule MCLs at the end of a full year of monitoring (Tab le 5.3).
Costs. The Stage 2 DBP rule will result in increased costs to public
water utilities and states. Although the rule applies to nea rly 75,000 sys-
tems, only a small portion will be required to make treatment changes.338 Chapter 5
The average cost of the rule is estimated at $79 million annual ly (using
a 3% discount rate), according to the US EPA.
The LT2 rule. The LT2 rule was published in the Federal Register on
June 5, 2006. This rule is intended to improve public health  by reduc-
ing waterborne outbreaks due to Cryptosporidium and other pathogens
in drinking water.
Requirements. The LT2 rule requires large public water systems (serv-
ing at least 10,000 people) that are supplied by surface wat er or GWUDI
of surface water to conduct 2 years of monthly sampling for
Cryptosporidium (and E. coli and turbidity for ﬁltered systems). To
reduce the cost of these monitoring, small water systems will m onitor
for E. coli for 1 year only because it is less expensive to analyze. TheTABLE 5.3 Timeframes for the Stage 2 DBP Rule and the Long Term 2 Enhanced

systems will only monitor for Cryptosporidium if their E. coli results
exceed speciﬁed concentrations.
After monitoring is complete, ﬁltered water systems will be cla ssiﬁed
in one of four treatment categories (bins) based on their monitoring
results. The EPA expects the majority of systems to be placed in the
lowest bin, and require no additional treatment. Systems pla ced in the
higher bins will be required to provide additional treatment to reduce
Cryptosporidium levels. Water systems in the higher bins and systems
that do not ﬁlter their water will choose additional treatment  options
from a “microbial toolbox” of treatment and management processes.
Because of contamination risks, the LT2 rule also addresses unc ov-
ered ﬁnished water storage facilities, such as reservoirs. The r ule
requires systems that store treated water in uncovered faciliti es to
either cover the facility or treat discharge to inactivate 4-log  virus, 3-log
Giardia lamblia, and 2-log Cryptosporidium . 
The LT2 rule also establishes disinfection benchmarking, in wh ich sys-
tems are required to review their current level of microbial treat ment
before making signiﬁcant changes in disinfection practices. This will
help systems maintain protection against microbial pathogen s as they
strive to reduce DBPs under the Stage 2 DBP rule.
Time frame. System-monitoring start dates correspond to system size.
Approximately 3 months before the monitoring start date, system s must
submit a sampling schedule and sampling location descrip tion. Systems
serving at least 100,000 people should begin monitoring in O ctober
2006. Those serving 50,000 to 99,000 people will begin monitor ing in
April 2007. Systems serving 10,000 to 49,000 people will begin moni-
toring in April 2008. The smallest systems (serving less th an 10,000
people) will begin monitoring for E. coli in October 2008. If needed,
additional Cryptosporidium treatment will start in April 2012 through
October 2014 depending on the size of the system (Table 5.3.).
When these 2 years of monitoring are complete and bin classiﬁcat ion
is determined, systems will have approximately 3 years to im plement
any additional treatment requirements. Systems will then con duct a
second round of monitoring 6 years after completing the initial round
to determine if source water conditions have changed signiﬁcant ly. 
Costs. The LT2 rule also will result in increased costs to public
water utilities and states. The US EPA estimates that the av erage
annualized present-value costs of the LT2 rule range from $92 to $1 33
million (using a 3% discount rate). Public water systems wil l be
responsible for nearly all of the total cost (99%), and states wil l pick
up the remaining 1%. The LT2 rule will also result in increas ed costs
for households, with the US EPA estimating an average annual house-
hold cost of $1.67 to $2.59.340 Chapter 5
Remark. Singer (2006) stated that accordingly, all utilities shoul d
modify their monitoring programs to measure all nine bromine- an d
chlorine-containing HAA species. Even though they are only requir ed
(sum of ﬁve HAA) species, they will have a much better understan ding
of their system and the interrelationships among source water q uality,
treatment practices, and DBP formation if all nine species are measured.
Furthermore, it is that in future versions of the DBP regulations —and
most assuredly, there will be future versions—US EPA will regul ate all
nine bromine- and chlorine-containing THMs. 
4.3 Compliance with standards
The US EPA has established a maximum contaminant level (MCL) of
drinking water for a number of biological, physical, and ch emical (inor-
ganics and organics) parameters, and radioactivity (Table 5.1, National
Primary Drinking Water Regulations). All the primary stan dards are
based on health effects to the customers, and they are mandatory stan-
dards. The National Secondary Drinking Water Regulations (Ta ble 5.1a)
pertain to those contaminants such as taste, odor, and color and some
chemicals that may adversely affect the aesthetic quality of d rinking
water. They are intended as guidelines for the states. The states may
establish higher or lower values as appropriate to their part icular cir-
cumstances to adequately protect public health and welfare.
The design engineer should be thoroughly familiar with and int egrate
the various regulatory requirements into a water treatment desi gn. In
addition to the federal regulations stated above, the other rules and reg-
ulations pertaining to drinking water are the Surface Water Treatment
Rule (SWTR), the revised Total Coliform Rule, the Lead and Copper
Rule, consumer conﬁdence report, Interim Enhanced SWTR, and the
Groundwater Rule. It is necessary to obtain a permit from the state reg-
ulatory agency. Meetings with the representatives of the necessar y reg-
ulatory agencies and related parties are recommended. The state r eview
of the designs is based on considerations of minimum design requ ire-
ments or standards, local conditions, and good engineering pr actice and
experience. The most widely used standards are the Recommended
Standards for Water Works promulgated by the Great Lakes-Upper
Mississippi River Board of State Sanitary Engineers (GLUMRB)  that
are called the Ten-State Standards. This board includes repres entatives
from the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnes ota, Missouri,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Recently, the Pr ovince of
Ontario (Canada) has joined the board. Many other states have used iden-
tical or similar versions of the Ten-State Standards.
The operational personnel at the drinking waterworks also have t o be
familiar and compliant with the regulations (especially the two rules
updated in 2006) related to the system. They have to take more ag gressivePublic Water Supply 341
sive management and technical approaches to produce drinking  water
that meets all standards and requirements. For these safeguard s to
their water supply, consumers are expected to pay more than th e cur-
rent very low price. 
Maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) for water quality is set  by the
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). For agents in drinkin g water
not considered to have carcinogenic potential, i.e. no effect levels for
chromic and/or lifetime period of exposure including a margin of safety, are
commonly referred to as reference dosages (RfDs). Reference dosages are
the exposure levels estimated to be without signiﬁcant risk to humans
when received daily over a lifetime. They are traditionally report ed as
mg/(kg ⋅d). For MCLG purposes, however, no effect level in drinking water
is measured by mg/L which has been in terms of the drinking water equiv-
alent level (DWEL). The DWEL is calculated as (Cotruvo and Vogt, 19 90)
(5.13)
where NOAEL /H11005no observed adverse effect level, mg/(kg /H11080d)
(70) /H11005assumed weight of an adult, kg
UF /H11005uncertainty factor (usually 10, 100, or 1000)
(2) /H11005assumed quantity of water consumed by an adult, L/d
When sufﬁcient data is available on the relative contribution from other
sources, i.e. from food and air, the MCLG can be determined as foll ows:
MCLG /H11005Rf D /H11002contribution from (food /H11001air)
In fact, comprehensive data on the contributions from food and air
are generally lacking. Therefore, in this case, MCLG is determin ed as
MCLG /H11005DWEL. The drinking water contribution often used in the
absence of speciﬁc data for food and air is 20% of RfD. This effectivel y
provides an additional safety factor of 5.
Example: The MCLG for nitrate–nitrogen is 10 mg/L. Assume UF /H11005100.
What is the “no observed adverse effect level for the drinking water? ”

4.4 Atrazine
Atrazine is a widely used organic herbicide due to its being inexpensive
compared to other chemicals. Often, excessive applications are u sed. When
soil and climatic conditions are favorable, atrazine may be t ransported to
the drinking water sources by runoff or by leaching into groun dwater.
Atrazine has been shown to affect offspring of rats and the hearts of
dogs. The US EPA has set the drinking water standard for atr azine con-
centration to 0.003 mg/L (or 3 /H9262g/L) to protect the public against the risk
of the adverse health effects. When atrazine or any other herbicide or pes-
ticide is detected in surfacewater or groundwater, it is not m eant as a
human health risk. Treated (ﬁnished) water meets the EPA limit s with
little or no health risk and is considered safe with respect t o atrazine.
Example: The lifetime health advisory level of 0.003 mg/L for atrazine is set
at 1000 times below the amount that causes no adverse health effects in lab-
oratory animals. The no observed adverse effect level is 0.086 mg/(k g /H11080d). How
is the 0.003 mg/L of atrazine in water derived?
solution: As previous example,
Using Eq. (5.13)
5 Water Treatment Processes
As the raw surface water comes to the treatment plant, physic al screening
is the ﬁrst step to remove coarse material and debris. Thereafter,  following
the basic treatment process of clariﬁcation, it would includ e coagulation, ﬂoc-
culation, and sedimentation prior to ﬁltration, then disinfec tion (mostly by
the use of chlorination). With a good quality source, the convent ional treat-
ment processes may be modiﬁed by removing the sedimentation proces s and
to just have the coagulation and ﬂocculation processes followed b y ﬁl-
tration. This treatment process scheme is called direct ﬁltra tion.
Groundwater is generally better quality; however, it is typi cally asso-
ciated with high hardness, iron, and manganese content. Aer ation or air
stripping is required to remove volatile compounds in groundwa ter.
Lime softening is also necessary to remove the impurities and reca r-
bonation is used to neutralize excess lime and to lower the pH val ue. Ion
exchange processes can also be employed for the softening of water and
the removal of other impurities, if low in iron, manganese, part iculates,DWEL 5 sNOAELds70d
sUFds2d
5  s0.086 mg/skg#ddds70 kgd
s1000ds2 L/dd
5  0.003 mg/Land organics. For a groundwater source high in ion and mang anese, but
with acceptable hardness, the aeration process and/or chemica l oxida-
tion can be followed by ﬁltration to remove these compounds.
The reverse osmosis process is used to remove chemical constituents
and salts in water. It offers the promise of conversion of saltwat er to fresh-
water. Other membrane processes, such as microﬁltration, ult raﬁltration,
nanoﬁlteration, and electrodialysis, are also applied in the water industry.
6 Aeration and Air Stripping
Aeration has been used to remove trace volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) in water either from surface water or groundwater sources. It has
also been employed to transfer a substance, such as oxygen, from air or
a gas phase into water in a process called gas adsorption or  oxidation
(to oxidize iron and/or manganese). Aeration also provides the escap e of
dissolved gases, such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulﬁde.
Air stripping has also been utilized effectively to remove ammonia  gas
from wastewater and to remove volatile tastes and other such sub -
stances in water.
The solubility of gases which do not react chemically with th e solvent
and the partial pressure of the gases at a given temperature c an be
expressed as Henry’s law:
p /H11005 Hx (5.14)
where x /H11005solubility of a gas in the solution phase
H /H11005Henry’s constant
p /H11005partial pressure of a gas over the solution
In terms of the partial pressure, Dalton’s law states that the total pres-
sure ( Pt) of a mixture of gases is just the sum of the pressures that eac h
gas ( Pi) would exert if it were present alone:

The greater the Henry’s constant, the more easily a compound can be

Henry’s constant and temperature relationship is (James M.

6.1 Gas transfer models
Three gas-liquid mass transfer models are generally used. They ar e two-
ﬁlm theory, penetration theory, and surface renewal theory. The ﬁr st
theory is discussed here. The other two can be found elsewhere
(Schroeder, 1977).
The two-ﬁlm theory is the oldest and simplest. The concept of the
two-ﬁlm model is illustrated in Fig. 5.1. Flux is a term us ed as the mass
transfer per time through a speciﬁed area. It is a function of the driv-
ing force for diffusion. The driving force in air is the difference bet ween
the bulk concentration and the interface concentration. The ﬂux gasni

Since Pi and Ciare not measurable, volumetric mass transfer coefﬁcients
are used, which combine the mass transfer coefﬁcients with the inter-
facial area per unit volume of system. Applying Henry’s law a nd intro-
ducing P*and C* which correspond to the equilibrium concentration
that would be associated with the bulk-gas partial pressur e Pgand bulk-

6.2 Diffused aeration
Diffused aeration systems distribute the gas uniformly through  the
water or wastewater, in such processes as ozonation, absorption,  activated-
sludge process, THM removal, and river or lake reaeration, etc. I t is more
costly using diffused aeration for VOC removal than the air st ripping
column.
The two-resistance layer theory is also applied to diffused aeration .
The model proposed by Mattee-Müller et al. (1981) is based on mass
transfer ﬂux derived from the assumption of diffused bubbles risi ng
in a completely mixed container. The mass transfer rate for diffus ed
aeration is

where Ci/H11005initial concentration, µg/L
If /H9258>> 1, the transfer of a compound is with very low Henry’s constan t
such as ammonia. Air bubbles exiting from the top of the liqu id surface
is saturated with ammonia in the stripping process. Ammon ia removal
could be further enhanced by increasing the air ﬂow. Until /H9258< 4, the
exponent term becomes essentially zero. When the exponent term is
zero, the air and water have reached an equilibrium condition and the
driving force has decreased to zero at some point within the react or
vessel. The vessel is not fully used. Thus the air-to-water ratio c ould be
increased to gain more removal.
On the other hand, if /H9258<< 1, the mass transfer efﬁciency could be
improved by increasing overall mass transfer coefﬁcient by eith er
increasing the mixing intensity in the tank or by using a ﬁner diffuser.
In the case for oxygenation, /H9258< 0.1, the improvements are required.
Example: A groundwater treatment plant has a capacity of 0.0438 m3/s
(1 MGD) and is aerated with diffused air to remove trichloroethyl ene with
90% design efﬁciency. The detention time of the tank is 30 min. E valuate the

6.3 Packed towers
Recently, the water treatment industry used packed towers for s tripping
highly volatile chemicals, such as hydrogen sulﬁde and VO Cs from
water and wastewater. It consists of a cylindrical shell c ontaining a
support plate for the packing material. Although many mater ials can
be used as the packing material, plastic products with v arious shapes
and design are most commonly used due to less weight and lower cost.
Packing material can be individually dumped randomly int o the cylin-
der tower or ﬁxed packing. The packed tower or columns are used for
mass transfer from the liquid to gas phase.
Figure 5.4 illustrates a liquid-gas contacting system wit h a down-
ward water velocity Lcontaining c1concentration of gas. The ﬂows are
counter current. The air velocity Gpasses upward through the packed
material containing inﬂuent p1and efﬂuent p2. There are a variety of
mixing patterns, each with a different rate of mass transfer. Removal
of an undesirable gas in the liquid phase needs a system heig ht of zand
a selected gas ﬂow rate to reduce the mole fraction of dissolved gas  from
c1to c2. If there is no chemical reaction that takes place in the pa cked% removal  5s131210d3100

Design of packed tower. Process design of packed towers or columns is
based on two quantities: the height of the packed column, z, to achieve
the designed removal of solute is the product of the height of a tra nsfer
unit (HTU) and the number of transfer unit (NTU). It can be express ed
as (Treybal, 1968):
z /H11005(HTU)(NTU) (5.38)
The HTU refers the rate of mass transfer for the particular packing
materials used. The NTU is a measure of the mass transfer drivi ng
force and is determined by the difference between actual and equili b-
rium phase concentrations. The height of a transfer unit is th e constant
portion of Eq. (5.35):
(5.39)
The number of transfer units is the integral portion of Eq. (5.35 ). For
diluted solutions, Henry’s law holds. Substituting the int egral expres-
sion for NTU with p1/H110050, the NTU is

The NTU depends upon the designed gas removal efficiency, the air-
water velocity ratio, and Henry’s constant. Treybal (1968) pl otted the
integral part (NTU) of Eq. (5.35) in Fig. 5.5. By knowing the desired
removal efficiency, the stripping factor, and Henry’s constant,  the
NTU in a packed column can be determined for any given stripp ing
factor of the air to water ﬂow rate ratios. It can be seen from Fig . 5.5
that when the stripping factor, R, is greater than 3, little improvement
for the NTU occurs.

6.4 Nozzles
There are numerous commercially available spray nozzles. Nozzles and
tray aerators are air-water contact devices. They are used for ir on and
manganese oxidation, removal of carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulﬁ de
from water, and removal of taste and odor causing materials.
Manufacturers may occasionally have mass transfer data suc h as KL
and a values. For an open atmosphere spray fountain, the speciﬁc inter -
facial area a is (Calderbrook and Moo-Young, 1961):
(5.43)
where d is the droplet diameter which ranges from 2 to 10,000 µm.
Under open atmosphere conditions, Csremains constant because there
is an inﬁnite air-to-water ratio and the Lewis and Whitman equ ation

7 Solubility Equilibrium
Chemical precipitation is one of the most commonly employed methods
for drinking water treatment. Coagulation with alum, ferric sulfate, or
ferrous sulfate, and lime softening involve chemical precipitati on. Most
chemical reactions are reversible to some degree. A general chemical
reaction which has reached equilibrium is commonly written by the law
of mass action as

239.81 m/s23s1.2 sd2368 Chapter 5The equilibrium constant Keqfor the above reaction is deﬁned as
(5.50b)
where Keqis a true constant, called the equilibrium constant, and the
square brackets signify the molar concentration of the species w ithin
the brackets. For a given chemical reaction, the value of equili brium
constant will change with temperature and the ionic strengt h of the
solution.
For an equilibrium to exist between a solid substance and its  solu-
tion, the solution must be saturated and in contact with u ndissolved
solids. For example, at pH greater than 10, solid calcium ca rbonate
in water reaches equilibrium with the calcium and carbona te ions in
solution: consider a saturated solution of CaCO3that is in contact with
solid CaCO3. The chemical equation for the relevant equilibrium can
be expressed as
CaCO3(s) ↔Ca2/H11001(aq) /H11001CO2
3/H11002(aq) (5.50c)
The equilibrium constant expression for the dissolution of CaCO3can
be written as
(5.50d)
Concentration of a solid substance is treated as a constant c alled Ksin
mass-action equilibrium, thus [CaCO3] is equal to ks. Then
(5.50e)
The constant Kspis called the solubility product constant. The rules
for writing the solubility product expression are the same as those
for the writing of any equilibrium constant expression. The solu bil-
ity product is equal to the product of the concentrations of the ions
involved in the equilibrium, each raised to the power of its coeffi cient
in the equilibrium equation. For the dissolution of a slightly  soluble
compound when the (brackets) concentration is denoted in moles,
the equilibrium constant is called the solubility product constant.
The general solubility product expression can be derived from the
general dissolution reaction

Solubility product constants for various solutions at or near  room tem-
perature are presented in Appendix C.
If the product of the ionic molar concentration [Ay/H11001]x[Bx/H11002]yis less than
the Kspvalue, the solution is unsaturated, and no precipitation wi ll occur.
In contrast, if the product of the concentration of ions in solut ion is greater
than Kspvalue, precipitation will occur under supersaturated condit ion.

8 Coagulation
Coagulation is a chemical process to remove turbidity and col or pro-
ducing material that is mostly colloidal particles (1 to 2 00 millimi-
crons, mm) such as algae, bacteria, organic and inorganic substan ces,x59.331025s100 g/Ld

negatively charged. The mechanisms of chemical coagulation inv olve
the zeta potential derived from double-layer compression, neutral-
ization by opposite charge, interparticle bridging, and prec ipitation.
Destabilization of colloid particles is inﬂuenced by the Van der Waals
force of attraction and Brownian movement. Detailed discussion of the
theory of coagulation can be found elsewhere (American Society of Civi l
Engineers and American Water Works Association, 1990). Coagu lation
and ﬂocculation processes were discussed in detail by Amirth arajah and
O’Melia (1990).
Coagulation of water and wastewater generally add either alumi num,
or iron salt, with and without polymers and coagulant aid s. The process
is complex and involves dissolution, hydrolysis, and polymer ization. pH
values play an important role in chemical coagulation depend ing on
alkalinity. The chemical coagulation can be simpliﬁed as t he following
reaction equations: 
Aluminum sulfate (alum):
Al2(SO4) ⋅18H2O /H110013Ca(HCO3)2→2A1(OH)3↓/H110013CaSO4/H11001
6CO2/H1100118H2O (5.51a)
When water does not have sufﬁcient total alkalinity to react wi th
alum, lime, or soda ash is usually also dosed to provide the required alka-
linity. The coagulation equations can be written as below:
Al2(SO4)3⋅18H2O /H110013Ca(OH)2→2A1(OH)3↓
/H110013CaSO4/H11001 18H2O (5.51b)

FeSO4⋅7H2O /H11001Ca(OH)2→Fe(OH)2/H11001CaSO4/H110017H2O (5.51f)

3FeSO4⋅7H2O /H110011.5 Cl2→Fe2(SO4)3/H11001FeCl3/H1100121H2O (5.51h)
followed by reacting with alkalinity as above
Fe2(SO4)3/H110013Ca(HCO3)2→2Fe(OH)3↓/H110013CaSO4/H110016CO2(5.51i)
and
2FeCl3/H110013Ca(HCO3)2→2Fe(OH)3↓/H110013CaCl2/H110016CO2(5.5lj)
Each of the above reaction has an optimum pH range.
Example 1: What is the amount of natural alkalinity required for coagula -
tion of raw water with dosage of 15.0 mg/L of ferric chloride?
solution:
Step 1.   Write the reactions equation (Eq. 5.51j) and calcu late MW

8.1 Jar test
For the jar test, chemical (coagulant) is added to raw water s ample for
mixing in the laboratory to simulate treatment-plant mixing  conditions.
Jar tests may provide overall process effectiveness, particularl y to
mixing intensity and duration as it affects ﬂoc size and den sity. It can
also be used for evaluating chemical feed sequence, feed intervals, and
chemical dilution ratios. A basic description of the jar test  procedure and
calculations is presented elsewhere (APHA 1995).
It is common to use six 2 L Gator jars with various dosages of chemi-
cal (alum, lime, etc); and one jar as the control without coag ulant.
Appropriate coagulant dosages are added to the 2 L samples before the
rapid mixing at 100 revolution per minute (rpm) for 2 min. Th en the sam-
ples and the control were ﬂocculated at 20 rpm for 20 or more mi nutes
and allow to settle. Water temperature, ﬂoc size, settling char acteristics
(velocity, etc.), color of supernatant, pH, etc. should be recorded.
The following examples illustrate calculations involved in the jar
tests; prepare stock solution, jar test solution mixture.
Example 1: Given that liquid alum is used as a coagulant. Speciﬁc gravity
of alum is 1.33. One gallon of alum weighs 11.09 pounds (5.0 3 kg) and contains
5.34 pounds (5.42 kg) of dry alum. Determine: (a) the alum conc entration,
(b) mL of liquid alum required to prepare a 100 mL solution of 2 0,000 mg/L
alum concentration, (c) the dosage concentration of 1 mL of stock sol ution in
a 2000 mL Gator jar sample.

Step 4. Find 1 mL of alum concentration ( z) in 2000 mL sample (jar)
Note : Actual ﬁnal volume is 2001 mL; using 2000 mL is still reasonable.
Example 2: Assuming that 1 mL of potassium permanganate stock solu-
tion provides l mg/L dosage in a 2 L jar, what is the weight  of potassium 
permanganate required to prepare 100 mL of stock solution? Assum e

Note : Use 0.20 mL of polymer in 100 mL of distilled water. This stock  solu-
tion has 2000 mg/L polymer concentration. One mL stock solution  added to
a 2 L jar gives 1 mg/L dosage.
8.2 Mixing
Mixing is an important operation for the coagulation process. In prac-
tice, rapid mixing provides complete and uniform dispersion of a chem-
ical added to the water. Then follows a slow mixing for ﬂocculat ion
(particle aggregation). The time required for rapid mixing is u sually 10
to 20 s. However, recent studies indicate the optimum time of rap id
mixing is a few minutes.
Types of mixing include propeller, turbine, paddle, pneumatic , and
hydraulic mixers. For a water treatment plant, mixing is used for coag-
ulation and ﬂocculation, and chlorine disinfection. Mixing is also used
for biological treatment processes for wastewater. Rapid mixing for
coagulant in raw water and activated-sludge process in was tewater
treatment are complete mixing. Flocculation basins after rapid  mixing
are designed based on an ideal plug ﬂow using ﬁrst-order kinet ics. It is
very difﬁcult to achieve an ideal plug ﬂow. In practice, ba fﬂes are
installed to reduce short-circuiting. The time of contact or deten tion
time in the basin can be determined by:

Power requirements. Power required for turbulent mixing is tradition-

The equation is used to calculate the mechanical power required to
facilitate rapid mixing. If a chemical is injected through  oriﬁces with
mixing times of approximately 1.0 s, the G value is in the range of 700
to 1000/s. In practice, G values of 3000 to 5000/s are preferable for rapid
mixing (ASCE and AWWA, 1990).
Eq. (5.53) can be expressed in terms of horsepower (hp) as

The equation is the standard design guideline used to calcula te the
mechanical power required to facilitate rapid mixing. Camp (1968)
claimed that rapid mixing at G values of 500 to 1000/s for 1 to 2 min pro-
duced essentially complete ﬂocculation and no further beneﬁt for p ro-
longed rapid mixing. For rapid mixing the product of Gt should be 30,000
to 60,000 with t (time) generally 60 to 120 s.

9 Flocculation
After rapid mixing, the water is passed through the ﬂoccula tion basin.
It is intended to mix the water to permit agglomeration of turb idity set-
tled particles (solid capture) into larger ﬂoes which would ha ve a mean
velocity gradient ranging 20 to 70 s/H110021for a contact time of 20 to 30 min
taking place in the ﬂocculation basin. A basin is usuall y designed in four
compartments (ASCE and AWWA 1990).
The conduits between the rapid mixing tank and the ﬂocculati on
basin should maintain G values of 100 to 150 s/H110021before entering the
basin.
For bafﬂed basin, the G value is

For paddle ﬂocculators, the useful power input of an impeller is
directly related to the drag force of the paddles (F). The drag force is the
product of the coefﬁcient of drag ( Cd) and the impeller force ( Fi). The drag
force can be expressed as (Fair et al. , 1968):

10 Sedimentation
Sedimentation is one of the most basic processes of water treatment.
Plain sedimentation, such as the use of a presedimentation basi n (grit
chamber) and sedimentation tank (or basin) following coagulation —
ﬂocculatiaon, is the most commonly used in water treatment fac ilities.
The grit chamber is generally installed upstream of a raw wa ter pump-
ing station to remove larger particles or objects. It is usua lly a rectan-
gular horizontal-ﬂow tank with a contracted inlet and the bot tom should
have at minimum a 1:100 longitudinal slope for basin drai ning and
cleaning purposes. A trash screen (about 2-cm opening) is usual ly
installed at the inlet of the grit chamber.Loading rate 5Q

133106 gal/d50.0295   day384 Chapter 5Sedimentation is a solid—liquid separation by gravitational  settling.
There are four types of sedimentation: discrete particle settling (t ype 1),
ﬂocculant settling (type 2), hindered settling (type 3), and c ompression
settling (type 4). Sedimentation theories for the four types are dis cussed
in Chapter 6 and elsewhere (Gregory and Zabel, 1990).
The terminal settling velocity of a single discrete particle is
derived from the forces (gravitational force, buoyant force, and drag
force) that act on the particle. The classical discrete particle set-
tling theories have been based on spherical particles. The equation
is expressed as
(5.60)
where u /H11005settling velocity of particles, m/s or ft/s
g /H11005gravitational acceleration, m/s2or ft/s2
rp /H11005density of particles, kg/m3or lb/ft3
r/H11005density of water, kg/m3or lb/ft3
d /H11005diameter of particles, m or ft
CD /H11005coefﬁcient of drag
The values of drag coefﬁcient depend on the density of water ( /H9267), rel-
ative velocity ( µ), particle diameter ( d), and viscosity of water ( µ), which
gives the Reynolds number Ras:
(5.61)
The value of CDdecreases as the Reynolds number increases. For R
less than 2 (or 1), CDis related to Rby the linear expression as follows:
(5.62)
At low values of R,substituting Eq. (5.61) and (5.62) into Eq. (5.60)
gives
(5.63)
This expression is known as the Stokes’ equation for laminar ﬂow
conditions.u5gsrp2rdd2

becomes (Fair et al., 1968):
(5.64)
In the region of turbulent ﬂow (500 /H110021000 < R< 200,000,) the CD
remains approximately constant at 0.44. The velocity of settli ng parti-
cles results in Newton’s equation (ASCE and AWWA 1990):
(5.65)
When the Reynolds number is greater than 200,000, the drag for ce
decreases substantially and CDbecomes 0.10. No settling occurs at this
condition.

10.1 Overﬂow rate
For sizing the sedimentation basin, the traditional criteria used are
based on overﬂow rate, detention time, weir loading rate, and hor izon-
tal velocity. The theoretical detention time is computed from the v olume
of the basin divided by average daily ﬂow (plug ﬂow theory):

The overﬂow rate is a standard design parameter which can be deter-
mined from discrete particle settling analysis. The overﬂow rat e or sur-
face loading rate is calculated by dividing the average dai ly ﬂow by the
total area of the sedimentation basin as follows:

(or m/d) (980 to 1470 gpd/ft2) for turbidity and color removal. For lime
softening, the overflow rate ranges 50 to 110 m/d (1230 to 2700
gpm/ft2). The overﬂow rate in wastewater treatment is lower, rang-
ing from 10 to 60 m/d (245 to 1470 gpm/ft2). All particles having a set-
tling velocity greater than the overﬂow rate will settle and b e removed.
It should be noted that rapid particle density changes due to tem-
perature, solid concentration, or salinity can induce densit y current
which can cause severe short-circuiting in horizontal tanks (Hudson,
1972).
Example: A water treatment plant has four clariﬁers treating 4.0 MGD
(0.175 m3/s) of water. Each clariﬁer is 16 ft (4.88 m) wide, 80 ft (24. 4 m) long,
and 15 ft (4.57 m) deep. Determine: (a) the detention time, (b) overﬂow  rate,
(c) horizontal velocity, and (d) weir loading rate assuming the weir length is

10.2 Inclined settlers
Inclined (tube and plate) settlers are sedimentation units tha t have
been used for more than two decades. A large number of smaller diam -
eter (20 to 50 mm) tubes are nested together to act as a single u nit and
inclined with various angles (7 /H11034to 60 /H11034). The typical separation distance
between inclined plates for unhindered settling is 2 in (5 cm) with
inclines of 3 to 6 ft (1 to 2 m) height. The solids or ﬂocs settle by gravi-
tational force. It is not necessary to use tubes and can take various
forms or plates also. The materials are lightweight, generally PVC or
ABC plastic (1 m /H110033 m in size).
Tube settlers have proved as effective units. However, there is a ten -
dency of clogging.
Inclined settling systems can be designed as cocurrent, coun tercur-
rent, and cross-ﬂow. Comprehensive theoretical analyses of various  ﬂow
geometries have been discussed by Yao (1976). The ﬂow velocity of the
settler module ( v) and the surface loading rate for the inclined settler
(u) (Fig. 5.6) are calculated as (James M. Montgomery Consulting
Engineering, 1985):

laboratory as 0.22 mm/s (0.67 in/min) at 15°C. Tube settl ers of 50.8 mm (2

sand, anthracite coal, diatomaceous earth, garnet, ilmenite,  or ﬁnely
woven fabric.
In early times, a slow sand ﬁlter was used. It is still proved to be
efficient. It is very effective for removing flocs containing microor-
ganisms such as algae, bacteria, virus, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium .
Rapid ﬁltration has been very popular for several decades. Filt ration
usually follows the coagulation–ﬂocculation–sedimentation proces ses.
However, for some water treatment, direct ﬁltration is used due to the
high quality of raw water. Dual-media ﬁlters (sand and ant hracite,
activated carbon, or granite) give more beneﬁts than single-m edia ﬁl-
ters and became more popular; even triple-media ﬁlters have been
used. In Russia, up-ﬂow ﬁlters are used. All ﬁlters need to c lean out
the medium by backwash after a certain period (most are based on
head loss) of ﬁltration.
The ﬁlters are also classiﬁed by allowing loading rate. Loadin g rate
is the ﬂow rate of water applied to the unit area of the ﬁlter. I t is the
same value as the ﬂow velocity approaching the ﬁlter surface a nd can
be determined by
v/H11005Q/A (5.67a)

Q/H11005ﬂow rate, m3/d or ft3/d or gpm
A/H11005surface area of ﬁlter, m2or ft2
On the basis of loading rate, the ﬁlters are classiﬁed as sl ow sand ﬁl-
ters, rapid sand ﬁlters, and high-rate sand ﬁlters. With  each type of ﬁlter
medium or media, there are typical design criteria for the ran ge of load-
ing rate, effective size, uniform coefﬁcient, minimum depth require-
ments, and backwash rate. The typical loading rate for rapi d sand ﬁlters
is 120 m3/(m2⋅d) [83 L/(m2⋅min) or 2 gpm/ft2]. For high-rate ﬁlters, the
loading rate may be four to ﬁve times this rate.
Example: A city is to install rapid sand ﬁlters downstream of the cl ariﬁers.
The design loading rate is selected to be 160 m3/(m2⋅d) (2.7 gpm/ft2). The
design capacity of the waterworks is 0.35 m3/s (8 MGD). The maximum sur-
face per ﬁlter is limited to 50 m2. Design the number and size of ﬁlters and cal-
culate the normal ﬁltration rate.

11.1 Filter medium size
Before a filter medium is selected, a grain size distribution an alysis
should be performed. The sieve size and percentage passing by weigh t
relationships are plotted on logarithmic-probability paper. A straight
line can be drawn. Determine the geometric mean size ( mg) and geo-
metric standard deviation size ( /H9268g). The most common parameters
used in the United States to characterize the filter medium are effec-
tive size (ES) and uniformity coefficient (UC) of medium size distri-
bution. The ES is that the grain size for which 10% of the grai n (d10)
are smaller by weight. The UC is the ratio of the 60-percentile ( d60)
to the 10-percentile. They can be written as (Fair et al., 1968; Cleasby,
1990):
(5.70)
(5.71)
The 90-percentile, d90, is the size for which 90% of the grains are smaller
by weight. It is interrelated to d10as (Cleasby 1990)
d90/H11005d10 (101.67 log UC) (5.72)
The d90size is used for computing the required ﬁlter backwash rate for
a ﬁlter medium.

and d60/H110050.74 mm. What are its uniformity coefﬁcient and d90?UC5d60/d105s1.535

11.2 Mixed media
Mixed media are popular for ﬁltration units. For the improvement
process performance, activated carbon or anthracite is added on  the top
of the sand bed. The approximate speciﬁc gravity ( s) of ilmenite sand,
silica sand, anthracite, and water are 4.2, 2.6, 1.5, and 1.0, respectively.
For equal settling velocities, the particle sizes for media of differen t

Head loss for ﬁxed bed ﬂow. The conventional ﬁxed-bed ﬁlters use a
granular medium of 0.5 to 1.0 mm size with a loading rate or  ﬁltration
velocity of 4.9 to 12.2 m/h (2 to 5 gpm/ft2). When the clean water ﬂows
through a clean granular (sand) ﬁlter, the loss of head (pressu re drop)
can be estimated by the Kozeny equation (Fair et al., 1968):

(Eq. (4.17)). The Rose equation is also used to determine the head los s
resulting from the water passing through the ﬁlter medium.
The Rose equation for estimating the head loss through ﬁlter mediu m
was developed experimentally by Rose in 1949 (Rose, 1951). It is  appli-
cable to rapid sand ﬁlters with a uniform near spherical or  spherical

Head loss for a fluidized bed. When a filter is subject to back wash-
ing, the upward flow of water travels through the granular b ed at a
sufficient velocity to suspend the filter medium in the water. Th is is
fluidization. During normal filter operation, the uniform parti cles of
sand occupy the depth L. During backwashing the bed expands to a
depth of Le. When the critical velocity ( /H9271c) is reached, the pressure
drops ( /H9004p/H11005h/H9267g /H11005/H9253c) and is equal to the buoyant force of the grain.
It can be expressed as
h/H9253/H11005(/H9253s/H11002 /H9253) (1 /H11002 /H9255e) Le
or

11.4 Washwater troughs
In the United States, in practice washwater troughs are in stalled at even
spaced intervals (5 to 7 ft apart) above the gravity ﬁlters. The washwater
troughs are employed to collect spent washwater. The total rate of dis-
charge in a rectangular trough with free ﬂow can be calcula ted by (Fair
et al. , 1968; ASCE and AWWA, 1990)
Q /H11005Cwh1.5(5.84a)
where Q /H11005ﬂow rate, cfs
C /H11005constant (2.49)
w /H11005trough width, ft
h /H11005maximum water depth in trough, ft
For rectangular horizontal troughs of such a short length frict ion
losses are negligible. Thus the theoretical value of the constant C is
2.49. The value of C may be as low as 1.72 (ASCE and AWWA, 1990).
In European practice, backwash water is generally dischar ged to the
side and no troughs are installed above the ﬁlter. For SI unit s, the rela-
tionship is

12 Water Softening
Hardness in water is mainly caused by the ions of calcium a nd magne-
sium. It may also be caused by the presence of metallic cation s of iron,
sodium, manganese, and strontium. These cations are present wi th
anions such as Cl–, ,and The carbonates and
bicarbonates of calcium, magnesium, and sodium are called c arbonate
hardness or temporary hardness since it can be removed and set tled by
boiling of water. Noncarbonate hardness is caused by the chlor ide and
sulfate slots of divalent cations. The total hardness is the su m of car-
bonate and noncarbonate hardness.
The classiﬁcation of hardness in water supply is shown in T able 5.5.
Although hard water has no health effects, using hard water would
increase the amount of soap needed and would produce scale on bath
ﬁxtures, cooking utensils. Hardness also causes scale and cor rosion
in hot-water heaters, boilers, and pipelines. Moderate hard wat er
with 60 to 120 mg/L as CaCO3is generally publicly acceptable (Clark
et al., 1977).
12.1 Lime-soda softening
The hardness in water can be removed by precipitation with li me,
Ca(OH)2and soda ash, Na2CO3and by an ion exchange process. Ion
exchange is discussed in another section. The reactions of lime-sod a
ash precipitation for hardness removal in water and recarbona tion are
shown in the following equations:

(5.94)
Approximately 1 eq/m3of lime in excess of the stoichiometric require-
ment must be added to bring the pH to above 11 to ensure Mg(OH)2 com-
plete precipitation. After the removal of precipitates, recarbonat ion is
needed to bring pH down to a range of 9.2 to 9.7.
The treatment processes for water softening may be different depend-
ing on the degree of hardness and the types and amount of chemica l
added. They may be single stage lime, excess lime, single stag e lime-
soda ash, and excess lime-soda ash processes.
Coldwell—Lawrence diagrams are based on equilibrium principles  for
solving water softening. The use of diagrams is an alternative to the sto-
ichiometric method. It solves simultaneous equilibria equation s and
estimates the chemical dosages of lime-soda ash softening. The inter -
ested reader is referred to the American Water Works Association (1 978)

The calcium equivalent should be placed ﬁrst on the cationic scale and be fol-
lowed by magnesium and other divalent species and then by th e monovalent

Total hardness /H11005220 /H1100116 /H11005236 (mg/L)
Step 6. Estimate the lime dose needed
Since the ﬁnal hardness desired is 40 mg/L as CaCO3, magnesium hardness
removal would not be required. The amount of lime needed ( x) would be equal
to carbonic acid concentration plus calcium carbonate hard ness:
x /H11005148 /H11001220
/H11005368 mg/L as CaCO3
or
/H11005272 mg/L as Ca(OH)2
or
/H11005 206 mg/L as CaO
The purity of lime is 70%. The total amount of lime needed is 
206/0.70 /H11005294 mg/L as CaO
Step 7. Estimate the hardness of treated water
The magnesium hardness level of 16 mg/L as CaCO3remains in the softened
water theoretically. The limit of calcium achievable is 30 to 50 mg/L of CaCO3
and would remain in the water unless using 5% to 10% in exces s of lime. Hardness
levels less than 50 mg/L as CaCO3are seldom achieved in plant operation.

trations of calcium and magnesium: pH /H110057.0, /H92511/H110050.77 (at T /H1100510°C). Alkalinity,

12.2 Pellet softening
Pellet softening has been used for softening in the Netherlands for ma ny
years. Pellet softening reactors have been installed at a number of loca-
tions in North America. The world’s largest pellet softening pl ant,
450,000 m3/d (119 MGD) of the design capacity, was installed in 2004
at the Cheng-Ching Lake Advanced Water Puriﬁcation Plant in
Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The pellet softening process reactors consist  of
square (or rectangular) or inverted conical tanks where calciu m crys-
tallizes on a suspended bed of ﬁne sand.
Advantages of the pellet softening reactor are its small size and  low
installation cost. Residuals consist of small pellets that dewater read-
ily, minimizing residuals volume. The pellet can be used for st eel man-
ufacture. However, pellet reactors should not be considered for system s
high in magnesium content because magnesium hydroxide is not
affected and may foul in the reactor.
Pellet softening is not proved and is not widely accepted as a t reat-
ment system in the United States. Pilot testing is advisabl e. Design
should be carefully coordinated with the equipment manufacturer . Pellet
softening processes should be designed cautiously.
Design and operation considerations. The pellet softening process is used
for removal of only calcium carbonate (CaCO3) hardness. The process
is based on the crystallization of calcium carbonate on seeded s and
(0.2 to 0.63 mm in size, ﬁxed-bed height /H110051.2 to 1.5 m) media. The chem-
ical reaction is described as below:
(5.94a) Ca211HCO2
31NasOHdSNa11CaCO 3 T1H2OPublic Water Supply 411Flocculated-settled water or raw water and caustic soda (NaOH) a re
injected (pumped) into the pressure chamber of pellet reactor throug h
a nozzle system. Water muzzles should be used to ensure a proper dis -
tribution of the water across the surface of the reactor.
The reactor is ﬁlled with a bed of sand material (automaticall y seeded)
that is ﬂuidized by the water ﬂow. The precipitated CaCO3will form a
ﬁxed layer ﬁrst on the surface of the seeded sand grain and lat er on the
created pellet surface itself. The pH value and the magnesium har dness
will not inﬂuence the process. 
The NaOH is mixed intensively with the water to avoid locally high
supersaturation, which would lead to spontaneous nucleation of CaCO3
instead of crystal growth on the sand. The chemical feed instal lation
(NaOH dosing pumps) is controlled by the digital control syst em accord-
ing to the calculated NaOH dosage, which is a function of the amount
of calcium hardness to be removed.
Due to the growth of CaCO3on the sand, the size of the individual pel-
lets will grow. This causes the increase in the ﬂuidized bed h eight (at
least height /H1100510 m at 100 m/h ﬂow). To balance the height of the ﬂu-
idized bed, pellets must be discharged from the reactor; also, a  speciﬁc
amount of new sand must be supplied to the pellet bed. The sizes of the
pellets can be controlled by the equilibrium of pellet extraction  and
sand supply.
A small amount of supersaturated CaCO3 may be carried in the out-
ﬂow of the reactor. Sulfuric acid is dosed at the outﬂow of the rea ctor
for the pH (7.5 to 7.9) adjustment. After softening in the pellet r eactors,
the softened water and the bypass raw water may be blended and then
ﬂow by gravity to the rapid sand ﬁlters.
A pellet-reactor design should comply with the following criteria :
■The water and NaOH in the pellet reactor should be properly dis-
tributed to avoid short-circuiting and to obtain plug-ﬂow con ditions
in the pellet reactor.
■The water and NaOH should be mixed intensively in the presence of
seed grains with a high speciﬁc surface area to achieve immed iate
crystallization.
■The turbulence in the reactor should be sufﬁciently high to prev ent
scaling of inlet nozzles and the reactor wall, and low enough to reduce
pellet erosion.
Sizing for reactors. The design overﬂow rate is between 80 and 100 m/h
(m3/m2⋅h). The height of the reactor is generally about 8 m. Thus, the
total area of the reactors can be easily determined with the soften ing
water ﬂow divided by the overﬂow rate.412 Chapter 5Example: Determine the size of pellet reactor for a plant ﬂow of 45,400 m3/d
or 12 MGD.

Caustic soda demand. For calculation purposes, the purity of caustic
soda is used as 100%. The estimation of NaOH demand for the total raw
water ﬂow rate is calculated as follows:

40 mg/L of NaOH are required for the neutralization of
44 mg/L.
Softening efﬁciency is greatly reduced by too large pellet diameter , insuf-
ﬁcient sand seeding, and high operation velocity in the react or. The efﬁ-Public Water Supply 413ciency ( E) of the NaOH dosage (demand) without considering the NaOH
demand for CO2can be computed as:
E/H11005100% /H11002(NaOH dosage /H110020.4(Ci/H11002Ce))% (5.94c)
Example 1: Estimate the NaOH demand for pellet softening of the entire
raw water ﬂow rate and softening efﬁciency without considering the NaOH
demand for CO2. The calcium hardness in inﬂuent and efﬂuent are 250 and
80 mg/L as CaCO3, respectively.

Step 1. Estimation of NaOH demand by using Eq. (5.94b)

Step 2. Calculate softening efﬁciency, E, using Eq. (5.94c)
E/H11005100% – (NaOH dosage – 0.4( Ci– Ce))%
/H11005100% – (88 – 0.4 (250 – 80))%

If the softened water is blended with ﬂocculated /settled water a t the soft-
ening reactor bypass and is blended additionally at postozona tion with
ﬂocculated and ﬁltered water, both blended waters shall incr ease the total

Seeding sand demand. A lack of sand supply for crystallization has a
negative impact on the efﬁciency of the softening (then more NaOH is
needed to get the desired total hardness). This excess dosage of NaOH
to be neutralized triggers an additional sulfuric acid deman d.
The seeding sand is added according to the demanded ratio between
effective sand size and pellet size. If the effective sand size or pellet size
is altered, the sand dosing rate also must be altered.
It is essential that very ﬁne, ﬁne, and smaller sand part icles should
be removed from sand prior feeding to the reactors. If not, the ﬁne p ar-
ticles would be ﬂushed out from the reactor due to up to 100 m/h  oper-
ation velocity there and enter the rapid ﬁltration units, ca using
additional permanent head losses. Those ﬁne particles will not be
removed during the rapid ﬁlter backwash sequence from the ﬁlter , as
the ﬁlter backwash velocity is only 40 to 50 m/h. The separa tion of the
very ﬁne, ﬁne, and smaller sand particles from large partic les is effec-
tive by washing the sand with a velocity of 120 m/h for a s et time. 
Sand can be fed (must be dry from a silo with free ﬂow) to a react or
batchwise at a time. The expected sand dosing rates range from 3 to 7 mg416 Chapter 5of sand per liter of water treated. Using the pellet-to-sand weight  ratio,
the demanded dosage of seeding sand can be calculated as:
Required sand dosage, mg/L /H11005(THr– THw)/pellet-
to-sand ratio (5.94i)
where THrand THware stated previously.
Example: Determine the required sand dosage and sand butch per volume
under the following conditions: The total hardness of the raw wat er and
treated water are respective 250 and 88 mg/L as CaCO3; the pellet-to-sand
ratio is 25 to 1. The surface area of the sand washer is A/H110050.2 m2. Speciﬁc

13 Ion Exchange
Ion exchange is a reversible process. Ions of a given species are dis-
placed from an insoluble solid substance (exchange medium) by i ons of
another species dissolved in water. In practice, water is pa ssed throughPublic Water Supply 417the exchange medium until the exchange capacity is exhausted  and
then it is regenerated. The process can be used to remove color, har d-
ness (calcium and magnesium), iron and manganese, nitrate a nd other
inorganics, heavy metals, and organics.
Exchange media which exchange cations are called cationic or  acid
exchangers, while materials which exchange anions are called  anionic
or base exchangers.
Common cation exchangers used in water softening are zeolite, green-
sand, and polystyrene resins. However, most ion exchange media a re
currently in use as synthetic materials.
Synthetic ion exchange resins include four general types used i n water
treatment. They are strong- and weak-acid cation exchangers and
strong- and weak-base anion exchangers. Examples of exchange reac -
tions as shown below (Schroeder, 1977):

2R—NH3Cl /H11001 ↔(R—NH3)2SO4/H110012Cl–(5.102)
where in each reaction, R is a hydrocarbon polymer and X is a speciﬁc
group, such as CH2.

4418 Chapter 5In the cation-exchange water softening process, the hardness-caus ing
elements of calcium and magnesium are removed and replaced with
sodium by a strong-acid cation resion. Ion-exchange reactions for  soft-
ening may be expressed as
(5.104)
where R represents the exchange resin. They indicate that when a  hard
water containing calcium and magnesium is passed through  an ion
exchanger, these metals are taken up by the resin, which sim ultaneously
gives up sodium in exchange. Sodium is dissolved in water. The normal
rate is 6 to 8 gpm/ft2(350 to 470 m/d) of medium.
After a period of operation, the exchanging capacity would be
exhausted. The unit is stopped from operation and regenerated by b ack-
washing with sodium chloride solution and rinsed. The void v olume for
backwash is usually 35% to 45% of the total bed volume.
The exchange capacity of typical resins are in the range of 2 t o 10 eq/kg.
Zeolite cation exchangers have the exchange capacity of 0.05 to 0.1 eq/kg
(Tchobanoglous and Schroeder, 1985). During regeneration, the rea ction
can be expressed as:
(5.105)
The spherical diameter in commercially available ion exchange resins
is of the order of 0.04 to 1.0 mm. The most common size ranges used in
large treatment plant are 20 to 50 mesh (0.85 to 0.3 mm) and  50 to 100
mesh (0.3 to 0.15 mm) (James M. Montgomery Consulting Engineeri ng,
1985). Details on the particle size and size range, effective size, and
uniform coefﬁcient are generally provided by the manufacturers.
The afﬁnity of exchanges is related to charge and size. The higher the
valence, the greater afﬁnity and the smaller the effective size the greater
the afﬁnity. For a given sense of similar ions, there is a genera l order of
afﬁnity for the exchanger. For synthetic resin exchangers, relat ive afﬁni-
ties of common ions increase as shown in Table 5.6.
The design of ion exchange units is based upon ion exchange equil ibria.
The generalized reaction equation for the exchange of ions A and on a
cation exchange resin can be expressed as
nR/H11002A/H11001/H11001Bn/H11001↔Rn/H11002Bn/H11001nA/H11001(5.106)

3424 Chapter 513.1 Leakage
Leakage is deﬁned as the appearance of a low concentration of the un de-
sirable ions in the column efﬂuent during the beginning of the exhaus-
tion. It comes generally from the residual ions in the bottom res ins due
to incomplete regeneration. Leakage will occur for softening process. A
water softening column is usually not fully regenerated due to i nefﬁcient
use of salt to completely regenerate the resin on the sodium form. The
leakage depends upon the ionic composition of the bed bottom and th e
composition of the inﬂuent water.
A detailed example of step-by-step design method for a ﬁx bed ion
exchange column for water softening is given by Beneﬁeld et al. (1982).
Example: The bottom of the water softener is 77% in the calcium form after
regeneration. The strong-acid cation resin has a total capacit y of 2.0 eq/L and
selective coefﬁcient for calcium over sodium is 2.6. Determine the initial cal-

4Public Water Supply 42513.2 Nitrate removal
Nitrate, is a nitrogen–oxygen ion that occurs frequently in n ature
as the result of interaction between nitrogen in the atmosphere an d
living things on earth. It is a portion of the nitrogen cycl e. When plant
and animal proteins are broken down, ammonia and nitrogen ga s are
released. Ammonia is subsequently oxidized to nitrite and nitr ate
by bacterial action (Fig. 1.1).
High concentration of nitrate in drinking water may cause met he-
moglobinemia, especially for infants. Nitrates interfere with th e body’s
ability to take oxygen from the air and distribute it to body  cells. The
United States EPA’s standard for nitrate in drinking wat er is 10 mg/L.
In Illinois, the water purveyor must furnish special bottle water (low
nitrate) to infants if the nitrate level of the ﬁnished water exceed s the
standard.
The sources of nitrates to water are due to human activities.
Agricultural activities, such as fertilizer application a nd animal feed-
lots, are major contributors of nitrate and ammonia to be wash ed off
(runoff ) and percolate to soil with precipitation. The nitrates t hat are
polluted can subsequently ﬂow into surface waters (streams and  lakes)
and into groundwater. Municipal sewage efﬂuents improperly tr eat
domestic wastewaters, and draining of septic tanks may cau se nitrate
contamination in the raw water source of a waterworks. Identiﬁ cation
of pollution sources and protective alternatives should be taken.
If the nitrate concentration in the water supply is excessive,  there are
two approaches for solving the problem, i.e. treatment for nitrat e
removal and nontreatment alternatives. Nontreatment alternativ es
may include (1) use new water source, (2) blend with low nitrat e waters,
(3) connect to other supplier(s), and (4) organize in a regional sys tem.
Nitrate is not removed by the conventional water treatment proces ses,
such as coagulation–ﬂocculation, sedimentation, ﬁltration, activated
carbon adsorption, and disinfection (chlorination and ozonation).  Some
treatment technologies, such as ion exchange, reverse osmosis, elec tro-
dialysis, microbial denitriﬁcation, and chemical reducti on, can remove
nitrates from drinking water. An ion exchange process design is given
as the following examples.sNO2

meq426 Chapter 5Two types (ﬁxed bed and continuous) of ion exchangers are used. The
ﬁxed bed exchange is used mostly for home and industry uses an d is con-
trolled by a ﬂow totalizer with an automatic regeneration cycl e at
approximately 75% to 80% of the theoretical bed capacity. Contin uous
ion exchangers are employed by larger installations, such as  water-
works, that provide continuous product water and require min imum bed
volume. A portion of the resin bed is withdrawn and regenerated ou t-
side of the main exchange vessel.
In the design of an ion exchange system for nitrate removal, raw  water
quality analyses and pilot testing are generally required. The type of
resin and resin capacity, bed dimensions, and regenerant req uirement
must be determined. Basic data, such as the design ﬂow rat e through the
exchanger, inﬂuent water quality, total anions, and sugges ted operating
conditions for the resin selected (from the manufacturer) must be kn own.
Analysis of water quality may include nitrate, sulfate, ch loride, bicar-
bonate, calcium carbonate, iron, total suspended solids, and  total organic
carbon. For Duolite A-104, for example, the suggested design para meters
are listed below (Diamond Shamrock Co., 1978):
Parameters Recommended values
Minimum bed depth 30 in
Backwash ﬂow rate 2–3 gpm/ft2
Regenerant dosage 15–18 lb sodium chloride (NaCl) per ft3resin
Regenerant concentration 10–12% NaCl by weight
Regenerant temperature Up to 120°F or 49°C
Regenerant ﬂow rate 0.5 gpm/ft3
Rinse ﬂow rate 2 gpm/ft3
Rinse volume 50–70 gal/ft3
Service ﬂow rate Up to 5 gpm/ft3
Operating temperature Salt form, up to 180°F or 85°C
pH limitation None
In design processes, resin capacity, bed dimensions, and reg enerant
requirements must be computed. Resin capacity determines the q uan-
tity of resin needed in the ion exchanger and is computed from a pilot
study. Data is provided by the manufacturer. For example, th e operat-
ing capacity of Duloite A-104 resin for nitrate removal is qui te depend-
ent upon the nitrate, sulfate, and total anion concentrations to calculate
the corrected resin capacity. The raw or uncorrected resin capa city is
determined by using the manufacturer’s graph (Fig. 5.7). This  capacity
must be adjusted downward to reﬂect the presence of sulfate in th e
water (Fig. 5.8), because sulfate anions will be exchanged before n itrate
(US EPA, 1983).
Once the adjusted resin capacity is determined for the water t o be
treated, the required bed volume of the ion exchange resin can bePublic Water Supply 427428 Chapter 5

calculated. The bed volume is the amount of nitrate that must be
removed in each cycle divided by the adjusted resin capacity . Using this
bed volume and minimum depth requirement, the surface area of res in
can be calculated. A standard size containment vessel can be selected
with the closest surface area. Using this standard size, th e depth of the
resin can be recalculated. The ﬁnal height of the vessel should be added
to a bed expansion factor during backwashing with a design  tempera-
ture selected (Fig. 5.9).
Once the bed volume and dimensions are computed, the regenera-
tion system can be designed. The regeneration system must deter-
mine: (1) the salt required per generation cycle, (2) the volume of b rine
produced per cycle, (3) the total volume of the brine storage tank,  and
(4) the time needed for the regeneration process. The design of an ion
exchanger for nitrate removal is illustrated in the following t hree
examples.
Example 1: A small public water system has the maximum daily ﬂow ra te
of 100,000 gal/d, maximum weekly ﬂow of 500,000 gal/week, an d maximum
nitrate concentration of 16 mg/L. The plant treats 100,000 ga l of water and
operates only 7 h/d and 5d/week (assume sufﬁcient storage capac ity for week-
end demand). Finished water after ion exchange process with 0.6 mg/L of
nitrate–nitrogen (NO3-N) will be blended with untreated water 16 mg/L of
NO3-N to produce a ﬁnished water of 8 mg/L or less of NO3-N. The NO3-N stan-
dard is 10 mg/L. Determine the ﬂow rate of ion exchanger in gpm  and the
blending rate.Public Water Supply 429

In Example 2, nitrate to be removed in each cycle is 215,700  meq
Step 3. Check the service ﬂow rate, SFR
In Example 1, the ion exchange unit ﬂow rate /H11005124 gpm 
This value exceeds the manufacturer’s maximum SFR of 5 gpm/ft3. In

Step 4. Determine bed dimensions.
(a) Select the vessel size
Based on the suggested design speciﬁcation, the minimum bed d epth ( z)
is 30 in or 2.5 feet. The area, A, would be
For a circular vessel, ﬁnd the diameter
The closest premanufactured size is 3.5 ft in diameter with a c orrespon-
ding cross-sectional area of 9.62 ft2. The resin height, h, would then be
recalculated as
(b) Adjusting for expansion during backwash
Since allowable backwash ﬂow rate is 2 to 3 gpm/ft2. If the backwash
rate is selected as 2.5 gpm/ft2with the backwash water temperature of
50°F, the percent bed expansion would be 58% as read from the cu rve in
Fig. 5.9. Thus, the design height ( H) of the vessel should be at least
Note : We use 3.5 ft diameter and 4.11 ft (at least) height vessel.
Step 5. Determine regenerant requirements
(a) Choice salt (NaCl) required per regeneration cycle since regener ant dosage
is 15 to 18 lb of salt per cubic foot of resin. Assume 16 lb/ft3is selected.

Iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) are abundant elements in the earth’s
crust. They are mostly in the oxidized state (ferric, Fe3/H11001, and Mn4/H11001) and
are insoluble in natural waters. However, under reducing condi tions (i.e.
where dissolved oxygen is lacking and carbon dioxide content i s high),
appreciable amounts of iron and manganese may occur in surfac e water,
groundwater, and in water from the anaerobic hypolimnion of str atiﬁed
lakes and reservoirs. The reduced forms are soluble divalent ferrous
(Fe2/H11001) and manganous (Mn2/H11001) ions that are chemically bound with
organic matter. Iron and manganese get into natural water fr om disso-
lution of rocks and soil, from acid mine drainage, and from cor rosion of
metals. Typical iron concentrations in groundwater are 1.0 to 10 mg/L,
and typical concentrations in oxygenated surface waters are 0 .05 to 0.2
mg/L. Manganese exists less frequently than iron and in smal ler
amounts. Typical manganese values in natural water range from 0.1 to
1.0 mg/L (James M. Montgomery Consulting Engineers, 1985). Voel ker
(1984) reported that iron and manganese levels in groundwaters in the
American Bottoms area of southwestern Illinois ranged from <0.01 to
82.0 mg/L and <0.01 to 4.70 mg/L, respectively, with mean c oncentra-
tions of 8.4 mg/L and 0.56 mg/L, respectively.
Generally, iron and manganese in water are not a health risk .
However, in public water supplies they may discolor water, an d cause
taste and odors. Elevated iron and manganese levels also can c ause
stains in plumbing, laundry, and cooking utencils. Iron  and manganese
may also cause problems in water distribution systems becau se metal
depositions may result in pipe encrustation and may promote t he growth
of iron bacteria which may in turn cause tastes and odors. Iron and
manganese may also cause difﬁculties in household ion exchange units
by clogging and coating the exchange medium.
To eliminate the problems caused by iron and manganese, the US
Environmental Protection Agency (1987) has established secondary  drink-
ing water standards for iron at 0.3 mg/L and for manganese a t 0.05 mg/L.
The Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB, 1990) has set efﬂuent s tan-
dards of 2.0 mg/L for total iron and 1.0 mg/L for total mangan ese.
It is considered that iron and manganese are essential elements  for
plants and animals. The United Nation Food and Agriculture Organization
recommended maximum levels for iron and manganese in irrigation  waters
are 0.5 and 0.2 mg/L, respectively.
The techniques for removing iron and manganese from water are
based on the oxidation of relatively soluble Fe(II) and Mn(II) to the
insoluble Fe(III) and Mn(III,IV) and the oxidation of any organic -complex
compounds. This is followed by ﬁltration to remove the Fe(III) and
processes for iron and manganese removal are discussed elsewhere
(Rehfeldt et al., 1992).Public Water Supply 435Four major techniques for iron and manganese removal from water
are: (1) oxidation–precipitation–filtration, (2) manganese zeolite
process, (3) lime softening–settling–ﬁltration, and (4) ion excha nge.
Aeration–filtration, chlorination–filtration, and manganese zeol ite
process are commonly used for public water supply.
14.1 Oxidation
Oxidation of soluble (reduced) iron and manganese can be achieved by
aeration, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, potassium permangana te
(KMnO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The chemical reactions can be
expressed as follows:
For aeration (Jobin and Ghosh, 1972; Dean, 1979)
(5.119)
(5.120)
In theory, 0.14 mg/L of oxygen is needed to oxidize 1 mg/L of iron an d
0.29 mg/L of oxygen for each mg/L of manganese.
For chlorination (White, 1972):
(5.121)
(5.122)
The stoichiometric amounts of chlorine needed to oxidize each mg/L of
iron and manganese are 0.62 and 1.3 mg/L, respectively.
For potassium permanganate oxidation (Ficek, 1980):
(5.123)
(5.124)
In theory, 0.94 mg/L of KMnO4is required for each mg/L of soluble iron
and 1.92 mg/L for 1 mg/L of soluble manganese. In practice, a 1 to 4%
solution of KMnO4is fed in at the low-lift pump station or at the rapid-
mix point. It should be totally consumed prior to ﬁltration.  However, the
required KMnO4dosage is generally less than the theoretical values
(Humphrey, and Eikleberry, 1962; Wong, 1984). Secondary oxida tion
reactions occur as

followed by oxidation
(5.130)
In either case, 2 moles of ferrous iron are oxidized per mole of hydrogen
peroxide, or 0.61 mg/L of 50% H2O2oxidizes l mg/L of ferrous iron.
For oxidation of manganese by hydrogen peroxide, the following reac-
tion applies (H.M. Castrantas, FMC Corporation, Princeton, NJ,  per-
sonal communication).
(5.131)
To oxidize 1 mg/L of soluble manganese, 1.24 mg/L of 50% H2O2 is
required.
Studies on groundwater by Rehfeldt et al. (1992) reported that oxidant
dosage required to meet the Illinois recommended total iron standa rd
follow the order of Na, O, Cl as Cl2> KMnO4> H2O2. The amount of
residues generated by oxidants at the critical dosages follow t he order
of KMnO4> NaOCl > H2O2, with KMnO4producing the largest,
strongest, and densest ﬂocs.
For ozonation: It is one of the strongest oxidants used in the water
industry for disinfection purposes. The oxidation potential of comm on
oxidants relative to chlorine is as follows (Peroxidation Systems,  1990):
Fluoride 2.32
Hydroxyl radical 2.06
Ozone 1.52
Hydrogen peroxide 1.31
Potassium permanganate 1.24
Chlorine 1.00
Ozone can be very effective for iron and manganese removal. Because
of its relatively high capital costs and operation and main tenance costs,
the ozonation process is rarely employed for the primary purpose of ox i-
dizing iron and manganese. Since ozone is effective in oxidizing tr ace
toxic organic matter in water, preozonation instead of prechlorin ationMn211H2O212H112e S Mn311e1H2O2Fe2111

for disinfection purposes. Ozonation can be used for two purposes: d is-
infection and metal removal.
Manganese zeolite process. In the manganese zeolite process, iron and
manganese are oxidized to the insoluble form and ﬁltered out, all in one
unit, by a combination of sorption and oxidation. The ﬁlter med ium can
be manganese greensand, which is a purple-black granular m aterial
processed from glauconitic greens, and/or a synthetic formulated  prod-
uct. Both of these compositions are sodium compounds treated with  a
manganous solution to exchange manganese for sodium and then oxi -
dized by KMnO4to produce an active manganese dioxide. The greensand
grains in the ﬁlter become coated with the oxidation products.  The oxi-
dized form of greensand then adsorbs soluble iron and manganese,
which are subsequently oxidized with KMnO4. One advantage is that
the greensand will adsorb the excess KMnO4 and any discolora tion of
the water.
Regenerative-batch process. The regenerative-batch process uses man-
ganese-treated greensand as both the oxidant source and the ﬁlter
medium. The manganese zeolite is made from KMnO4-treated greensand
zeolite. The chemical reactions can be expressed as follows (Humphrey
and Eikleberry, 1962; Wilmarth, 1968):
Exchange:
NaZ /H11001Mn2/H11001→MnZ /H110012Na/H11001(5.132)
Generation:
MnZ /H11001KMnO4→Z ⋅MnO2/H11001K/H11001(5.133)
Degeneration:
(5.134)
Regeneration:
(5.135)
where NaZ is greensand zeolite and Z /H11080MnO2is manganese zeolite. As
the water passes through the mineral bed, the soluble iron and  man-
ganese are oxidized (degeneration). Regeneration is required after the
manganese zeolite is exhausted.Z # MnO 31KMnO 4SZ # MnO 2Z # MnO 21Fe21
Mn21SZ # MnO 31Fe31
Mn31
Mn41438 Chapter 5One of the serious problems with the regenerative-batch process is the
possibility of soluble manganese leakage. In addition, excess a mounts
of KMnO4are wasted, and the process is not economical for water high
in metal content. Manganese zeolite has an exchange capacity of 0.09 lb
of iron or manganese per cubic foot of material, and the ﬂow rate t o the
exchanger is usually 3.0 gpm/ft3. Regeneration needs approximately
0.18 lb KMnO4/ft3of zeolite.
Continuous process. For the continuous process, 1% to 4% KMnO4solu-
tion is continuously fed ahead of a ﬁlter containing anthraci te be (6- to 9-
in thick), manganese-treated greensand (24 to 30 in), and grav el. The
system takes full advantage of the higher oxidation potential of KMnO4
as compared to manganese dioxide. In addition, the greensand c an act as
a buffer. The KMnO4oxidizes iron, manganese, and hydrogen sulﬁde to
the insoluble state before the water reaches the manganese zeolite bed.
Greensand grain has a smaller effective size than silica sand  used in
ﬁlters and can result in comparatively higher head loss. Th erefore, a layer
of anthracite is placed above the greensand to prolong ﬁlter run s by ﬁl-
tering out the precipitate. The upper layer of anthracite operates  basi-
cally as a ﬁlter medium. When iron and manganese deposits bu ild up,
the system is backwashed like an ordinary sand ﬁlter. The m anganese
zeolite not only serves as a ﬁlter medium but also as a buffer to oxidize
any residual soluble iron and manganese and to remove any exces s unre-
acted KMnO4. Thus a KMnO4demand test should be performed. The con-
tinuous system is recommended for waters where iron predominates, and
the intermittent regeneration system is recommended for groundwater
where manganese predominates (Inversand Co., 1987).

15.1 Adsorption isotherm equations
The Freundlich isotherm equation is an empirical equation, whi ch gives
an accurate description of adsorption of organic adsorption in water. The

(1990) compiled the values of K and 1/ nfor various organic compounds
from the literature which is listed in Appendix D.
From the adsorption isotherm, it can be seen that, for ﬁxed valu es of
K and Ce, the smaller the value of 1/ n, the stronger the adsorption capac-
ity. When 1/ nbecomes very small, the adsorption tends to be inde-
pendent to Ce. For ﬁxed values of Ceand 1/ n, the larger the K value, the
greater the adsorption capacity qe.
Another adsorption isotherm developed by Langmuir assumed that
the adsorption surface is saturated when a monolayer has been

rate, depth of the bed and area of the GAC column. The EBCT is ca l-
culated by taking the volume ( V) occupied by the GAC divided by the
ﬂow rate ( Q):

The critical depth of a bed ( Hcr) is the depth which creates the immedi-
ate appearance of an efﬂuent concentration equal to the breakthroug h
concentration, Cb. The Cbfor a GAC column is designated as the maxi-
mum acceptable efﬂuent concentration or the minimum datable con -
centration. The GAC should be replaced or regenerated when the
efﬂuent quality reaches Cb. Under these conditions, the minimum EBCT
(EBCTmin) will be:

The actual contact time is the product of the EBCT and the int er-
particle porosity (about 0.4 to 0.5).

16 Membrane Processes
In the water industry, the membrane systems have generally b een uti-
lized in water and for higher quality water production. Membr anes
also are being used for municipal and industrial wastewater  appli-
cations, for efﬂuent ﬁltration to achieve high-quality efﬂuent for sen-
sitive receiving waters, for various water reuse applications,  as a
space-saving technology, and for on-site treatment. In the last decade,
tremendous improvements of equipment developments, more strin-
gent effluent limit, and market economics have led to membranes
becoming a mainstream treatment technology. There has been sig-
niﬁcant growth and increase in application of membrane techn ologies,
and it is expected that membrane processes will be used even mor e
in the future as more stringent drinking water quality sta ndards will
likely become enforced.
The use of semipermeable membranes having pore size as small as
3 Å (1 angstrom /H1100510/H110028cm) can remove dissolved impurities in water
or wastewater. Desalting of seawater is an example. The process t hat
allows water to pass through the membranes is called “osmosis ” or
hyperﬁltration. On the other hand, the process in which ions  and solute
that pass through a membrane is called “dialysis” which  is also used in
the medical ﬁeld.D5sC02Ced

e444 Chapter 516.1 Process description and operations  
The membrane processes were originally developed based on the theory
of reverse osmosis. Osmosis is the natural passage of water throu gh a
semipermeable membrane from a weaker solution to a stronger solution ,
to equalize the concentration of solutes in both sides of the membran e.
Osmotic pressure is the driving force for osmosis to occur. In r everse
osmosis, an external pressure greater than the osmotic pressure is
applied to the solution. This high pressure causes water to ﬂow  against
the natural direction through the membrane, thus producing high-quality
demineralized water while rejecting the passage of dissolved solid s.
The driving force for a membrane process can be pressure, electrica l
voltage, concentration gradient, temperature, or combinations of the
above. The ﬁrst two driving forces are employed for water and wast e-
water membrane ﬁltrations. Membrane processes driven by pressu re are
microﬁltration (MF), utraﬁltration (UF), nanoﬁltration (NF), and reverse
osmosis (RO); while processes driven by electric current are elect ro-
dialysis (ED) and electrodialysis reversal (EDR). ED is origi nally used
for medical purposes. EDR is generally used for water and wast ewater
treatments. The vacuum-driven process typically applies to MF and UF
only.
Microfiltration. Microfiltration uses microporous membranes that
have effective pore sizes in the range of 0.07 to1.3 /H9262m and typically
have actual pore size of 0.45 /H9262m (Bergman, 2005). The particle-
removal range is between 0.05 and 1 /H9262m. Flow through a microp-
orous membrane can occur without the application of pressure on the
feed side of the membrane, but in most water and wastewater appl i-
cants, a small pressure difference across the membrane produces sig-
niﬁcant increases in ﬂux, which is required for water produ ction. MF
membranes are capable of removing particles with sizes down to 0 .1
to 0.2 /H9262m. As granular filtration, MF system filters out turbidity ,
algae, bacteria, Giardia cysts, Cryptosporidium oocysts, and all par-
ticulate matters in water treatment (Bergman, 2005; Movahed,  2006a,
2006b). It is also most often used to separate suspended and col loidal
solids from wastewater.
Ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration uses membranes that have effective
pore sizes of 0.005 to 0.25 /H9262m (Bergman, 2005). UF units are capable
of separating some large-molecular-weight dissolved organics, col-
loids, macromolecules, asbestos, and some viruses from water and
wastewater by pressure (Qasim et al. , 2000; Bergman, 2005, Movahed,
2006b). The UF process is designed to remove colloidalized particles ,
in the range from 0.005 to 0.1 /H9262m (Movahed, 2006a). It is not effec-
tive for demineralization purposes; however, most turbidity-causi ngPublic Water Supply 445particles, viruses, and most organic substances such as large molec-
ular NOMs (natural organic matters, with coagulation) and  proteins
are within the removal range of UF. 
In the case of food processing, UF units can be used to separate p ro-
teins and carbohydrates from the wastewater. The proteins and c arbo-
hydrates may then be reused in the process or sold as a by-prod uct.
Another use of UF units is the separation of emulsiﬁed fats, oils,  and
grease from wastewater (Alley, 2000). The UF process retains nonioni c
material and generally passes most ionic matter depending on molecu-
lar weight cutoff of the membrane. 
Both MF and UF membrane systems generally use hollow ﬁbers that
can be operated in the outside-in or inside-out direction of ﬂow. Low pres-
sure (5 to 35 psi or 34 to 240 kPa) or vacuum (–1 to –12 psi or –7 
to –83 kPa for outside-in membranes only) can be used as the dri ving
force across the membrane (Movahed, 2006a; Bergman, 2005). MF an d
UF membranes are most commonly made from various organic polymers
such as cellulose derivatives, polysulfones, polypropylene, and polyvinyli-
dene ﬂuoride (PVDF). Physical conﬁgurations of MF and UF mem-
branes include hollow ﬁber, spiral wound, cartridge, and t ubular
constructions. Membrane technologies are also widely used for was te-
water treatment (Movahed, 2006a).
Most MF and UF facilities operate with high recoveries of 90% to
98%. Full-scale systems have demonstrated the efﬁcient performance
of both MF and UF as feasible treatment alternatives to conventiona l
granular media ﬁltrations. Both MF and UF units can also be used as
a pretreatment for NF or RO or to replace the conventional media
ﬁltration.
Nanoﬁltration. “Nano” means one-thousandth of a million (10/H110029). One
nanometer (1 nm) /H1100510/H110029m /H1100510/H110023/H9262m. Nanoﬁltration uses membranes
that have a larger effective pore size (0.0009 to 0.005 /H9262m or about 1 to
5 nm) than that of RO membranes (Qasim et al. , 2000; Bergman, 2005).
NF and RO separation properties are typically expressed in mol ecular
weight cutoff (MWCO) as the unit of mass in daltons. The typical  masses
used for NF and RO are 200 to 1000 daltons and <100 daltons,  respec-
tively (Movahed, 2006c).  
The typical feed pressures for NF system are 50 to 150 psi (340 t o 1030
kPa) (Bergman, 2005). The osmotic pressure equation still applies  to NF,
but the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane will be low er.
It could be 10 to 20 psi (Movahed, 2006c). The osmotic pressure differ-
ential across the membrane is taken into account in the equat ion for
water transport through the membrane.
The major equipment for an NF process is similar to that for an RO
system, and includes a membrane module with support system,  a446 Chapter 5high-pressure pump and piping, and a concentrate-handling and dis-
posal system. The NF is only periodically backwashed by usin g either
water or air as with a granular filtration system. Membra nes are
usually cleaned automatically as required. 
New development. NF processes reject molecules in the range from
0.001 to 0.01 /H9262m. Such a process can be used for softening and for reduc-
tion of total dissolved solids (TDS) and TOC. A lower-pressure RO tec h-
nology called nanoﬁltration, also known as “membrane softening, ” has
also been widely used for treatment of hard, high-color, and high -organic-
content feedwater (Movahed, 2006a). NF also removes NOM, disinfec-
tion by-products (DBPs), and radionuclides (Movahed, 2006a; Cr ittenden
et al., 2005). 
Cregorski (2006) reported that in early 2006, researchers at t he
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory created a membrane made of
carbon nanotubes and silicon which may offer an even less-expensi ve
desalination technology. The nanotubes, special molecules made of
carbon atoms in a unique arrangement, are hollow and more tha n 50,000
times thinner than a human hair. Billions of these tubes ac t as pores in
the membrane allowing liquids and gases to rapidly pass t hrough while
the tiny pore size blocks larger molecules. 
The research team was able to measure ﬂows of liquids by making  a
membrane on a silicon chip with carbon nanotube pores, ideal for desali-
nation. The membrane was created by ﬁlling with a ceramic m atrix
material into the gaps between aligned carbon nanotubes. The por es are
so small that only six water molecules could ﬁt across their  diameter.
According to Olgica Bakajin, lead scientist for the Nationa l Laboratory
nanotube membrane research project, “The gas and water ﬂows tha t we
measured are 100 to 10,000 times faster than what classica l models
predict. In regards to desalination, the process is usually  performed
using an RO membrane process, which does require a large amou nt of
pressure and energy. According to the research team, the more per me-
able nanotube membranes could reduce energy costs of desalination by
up to 75% compared to current RO technology. We hope that this  tech-
nology will be ready for the market soon”.
Reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis is a membrane separation process,
which through the application of pressure, reverses the natura l phe-
nomenon of osmosis. Osmosis is the ﬂow of water from an area of low
ionic concentration to an area of high ionic concentration. Und er an
applied pressure, water is forced through a semipermeable membra ne
from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration. The
semipermeable membrane rejects the solutes in the water while all ow-
ing the clean water to pass through.Public Water Supply 447The effective pore sizes of RO membranes range from 0.1 to 1.2 nm
(0.0001 to 0.0012 /H9262m) (Qasim et al., 2000; Bergman, 2005). This pore
size allows the passage of only water. In order for RO to take pla ce,
the applied pressure must be greater than the naturally occu rring
osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure is a characteristic of the solution
and is a function of the molar concentration of the solute, the nu mber
of ions formed when the solute dissociates, and the solution
temperature. 
Reverse osmosis modules have been developed in four different types
of designs: plate and frame, large tube, spiral wound, and h ollow ﬁber.
Many types of membranes for RO have been developed, but cellulose
acetate and polyamide are currently the most widely used membr ane
materials in RO systems. Typical membranes are approximat ely 100 /H9262m-
thick having a surface skin of about 0.2- /H9262m thickness that serves as the
rejecting surface. The remaining layer is porous and spongy, a nd serves
as backing material. The hollow ﬁne ﬁbers have outer and inner  diam-
eters of 50 and 25 /H9262m, respectively (Qasim et al. , 2000). 
Reverse osmosis processes are mostly used for demineralization in
industrial water supply or for desalinization of seawater and brackish
water in drinking water supply. The RO cartridges have been  widely
installed for tap water at homes and ofﬁces in Asian countries , such as
Taiwan and Japan. Even coin-operated RO water supplies are p opular
on streets.
Reverse osmosis membrane technology has been successfully used
since the 1970s for brackish and seawater desalination. In comparison
with other membranes, the RO membrane rejects most solute ions a nd
molecules, while allowing water of vary low mineral content to p ass
through (Movahed, 2006b). Of course, this process also works as  a bar-
rier for cysts, bacteria, viruses, NOMs, DBPs, etc. 
In the RO process, the feedwater is forced by hydrostatic pressu re
through membranes while impurities remain behind. The puriﬁed  water
(permeable or product water) emerges at near atmospheric pressure. The
waste (as concentrate) remains at its original pressure and i s collected
in a concentrated mineral stream. The pressure difference is call ed
osmotic pressure that is a function of the solute concentration, charac-
teristics, and temperature. The operating pressure ranges from 8 00 to
1200 psi (5520 to 8270 kPa or 54.4 to 81.6 atm) for desaltin g seawater
and from 300 to 600 psi (2400 to 4100 kPa or 20.4 to 40.8 a tm) for brack-
ish water desaltation (Montgomery Consulting Engineers, 1985;
Bergman, 2005).
The RO process produces a concentrated reject stream in addition
to the clean permeate product. By-product water or the “concentra te”
may range from 10% to 60% of the raw water pumped to the RO unit .
For most brackish water and ionic contaminant removal appli cations,448 Chapter 5the concentrate is in the 10% to 25% range, while for seawater, i t could
be as high as 50%. Typical RO/NF elements are in spiral wou nd ele-
ment configuration, while EDR is in stacks containing memb rane
sheets.
Electrodialysis reversal. Electrodialysis is an electrochemical sepa-
ration process in which ions are transferred through ion excha nge
membrane by means of an electrical driving force. When a DC volt -
age is applied across a pair of electrodes, positively charged ions move
toward the cathode, while negatively charged ions move toward t he
anode. Membranes are placed between the electrodes to form several
compartments. Flow spacers are placed between the membranes to
support the membranes and to create turbulent flow. Water flows
along the spacers’ ﬂow paths across the surface of the membranes,
rather than through the membranes as in RO (von Gottberg, 19 99).
Impurities are electrically removed from the water. EDR is an ED
process, except by reversing polarity two to four times per hour;  the
system provides constant, automatic self-cleaning that enables
improving treatment efficiency and less downtime for periodic
cleaning.
The conﬁguration of EDR is in stacks containing membrane sheet s.
The nonpressure EDR has also been widely used for removal of dis-
solved substances and contaminants. In the United States, RO and
EDR ﬁrst have been used for water utilities ranging from 0.5 to 12 MGD
(1.94 to 45.4 m3/d); most are located in the East Coast and West Coast
(Ionic, 1993).
16.2 Design considerations 
Membrane ﬁltration technologies have emerged as viable options for
addressing current and future drinking water regulations r elated to the
treatment of surface water, groundwater under the inﬂuence, and water
reuse applications for microbial, turbidity, NOM, and DBP removal.
Membrane systems are now available in several different forms and
sizes, each uniquely ﬁtting a particular need and applica tion.
The basic theory, process fundamentals, membrane fouling, and
process design for membrane ﬁltration are given elsewhere (Crittend en
et al., 2005; Bergman, 2005). The design engineer must understand th e
fundamentals of membrane material, modules, fouling, scaling, and per-
formance to evaluate new technologies with the objective of the project .
Design assistance is often available from the equipment manufac turers.
Membrane processes that satisfy treatment objectives at the lowes t
possible life-cycle cost should be selected. The following proceduresPublic Water Supply 449should be considered in membrane system selection (Bergman, 2005 ;
Crittenden et al., 2005; Qasim et al., 2000):
■Review the historical water quality data. 
■Identify overall project goals and deﬁne the correct treatment.
■Evaluate source water quality characteristics and select p retreat-
ment processes.
■Assess the need for bench or pilot testing.
■Select membrane system after consultation with the equipment ma n-
ufacturers and pilot testing.
■Select feedwater pretreatment or disinfection requirements (methods
to control fouling).
■Select the basic performance criteria: plant capacity, sali nity of feed-
water, ﬂux rate, recovery rate, rejection, applied pressure, sy stem
life, performance level, feedwater temperature, and permeate solute
concentration based on the best and worst conditions.
■Determine product water quality and quantity requirements a nd
blending options (for example, split-ﬂow treatment). 
■Establish process design criteria and develop speciﬁcations for major
system components.
■Calculate system size. 
■Select the type of membrane and determine the array conﬁguration.  
■Determine ancillary and support facilities, such as trans fer piping,
pumping facilities, chemical storage facilities, laboratory space, build-
ings, energy recovery system, and electrical systems.
■Determine power requirement.
■Evaluate hydraulic grade line and waste wash water dispos al options.
■Select permeate posttreatment requirements.
■Estimate system economics, including amortization of capital and
operation and maintenance cost, supplies and chemicals, and  con-
centrate disposal.
■Select equipment and procedures for process monitoring.
16.3 Membrane performance
The osmotic pressure theoretically varies in the same manner as the
pressure of an ideal gas (James Montgomery Consulting Engineers,
1985; Conlon, 1990):

At equilibrium, the pressure difference between the two sides of the
RO membranes equals the osmotic pressure difference. In low solute con-
centration, the osmotic pressure ( /H9266) of a solution is given by the following
equation (US EPA, 1996):
/H9266/H11005CsRT (5.145c)

When dilute and concentrated solutions are separated by a mem-
brane, the liquid tends to ﬂow through the membrane from the di lute
to the concentrated side until equilibrium reaches sides of the membrane.
The liquid and water passages (ﬂux of water) through the membra ne are
a function of pressure gradient (Allied Signal, 1970):
Fw/H11005W (/H9004P/H11002/H9004/H9266) (5.146)

The liquid or solvent ﬂow depends upon the pressure gradient. The

are inﬂuenced by the membrane types and characteristics.
The terms “water ﬂux” and “salt ﬂux” are the quantities of w ater
and salt that can pass through the membrane per unit area  per

Salt rejection is commonly measured by the total dissolved soli ds (TDS).
Measurements of conductivity are sometimes used in lieu of TDS. In  RO
system, salt rejection can be achieved at 9% or more for seawaters ; while
NF could be as low as 60% to 70% (Movahed, 2006c). Solute rejection
varies with feedwater concentration, membrane types, water recover y
rate, chemical valance of the ions in the solute, and other fact ors.

The TDS concentration of the product water is lower than the limi t desired.

The TDS in the blended water is limited to 0.45 kg/m3.

16.4 Silt density index
Silt density index (SDI) test involves water ﬁltering in the dead end
mode with no cross-ﬂow at a constant pressure of 207 kPa (30 psi g). It
uses disc membranes rated at 0.45 /H9262m for a 15-min test with a 500-mL
water sample. The SDI is calculated as (Chellam et al., 1997):

ti/H11005time initially needed to ﬁlter 500 mL of sample
tf/H11005time needed to ﬁlter 500 mL at the end of the 15-min
test period
The SDI has been widely used as a rough estimation of the potenti al
for colloidal fouling of NF and RO systems. Generally, the feedwater s
for NF and RO should have SDI of 4 or less. (Most manufacturers have
a 4 as warranty limit.)
Example: The time initially required to ﬁlter 500 mL of dual-media ﬁlter
efﬂuent is 14.5 s. The time required to ﬁlter 500 mL of the same w ater sample
at the end of the 15-min test period is 35 s. Calculate the SD I.

17 Residual from Water Plant
A water treatment plant not only produces drinking water, bu t is also
a solids generator. The residual (solids or wastes) comes princip ally
from clariﬁer basins and ﬁlter backwashes. These residuals c ontain
solids which are derived from suspended and dissolved solids i n the
raw water with the addition of chemicals and chemical react ions.
Depending on the treatment process employed, waste from water
treatment plants can be classiﬁed as alum, iron, or polymer  sludge from
coagulation and sedimentation; lime sludge or brine waste from water 53.9SDI5a12ti

membranes.
The residual characteristics and management of water plant s ludge
and environmental impacts are discussed in detail elsewhere (Li n and
Green, 1987).
Prior to the 1970s, residuals from a water treatment plant wer e dis-
posed of in a convenient place, mostly in surface water. Under t he 1972
Water Pollution Control Act, the discharge of a water plant res iduals
requires a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (N PDES)
permit. Residuals directly discharged into surface water is  prohibited
by law in most states. Proper residual (solids) handling, di sposal, and/or
recovery is necessary for each waterwork nowadays. Engineers mus t
make their best estimate of the quantity and quality of residu als gen-
erated from the treatment units.
Example 1 :A conventional water treatment plant treats an average ﬂow
of 0.22 m3/s (5.0 MGD). The total suspended solids (TSS) concentration in
raw (river) water averages 88 mg/L. The TSS removal through sedim enta-
tion and ﬁltration processes is 97%. Alum is used for coagula tion/sedimen-
tation purpose. The average dosage of alum is 26 mg/L. Assume th e
aluminum ion is completely converted to aluminum hydroxide, (a ) Compute
the average production of alum sludge. (MW: Al /H1100527, S /H1100532, O /H1100516, and

17.1 Residual production and density
The quantity of residuals (called sludge) generated from clariﬁers  are
related to coagulants used, raw water quality, and process design. The
residual production for whole water plant as the weight per un it volume
treated (g/m3or lb/Mgal) and its solids concentration should be deter-
mined. These values with the average ﬂow rate will be used for th e esti-
mation of daily residual production. Then the residual product ion rate
can be employed for the design of residual (sludge) treatment units ,
commonly intermitted sand drying bed. The density of residuals  (pounds
per gallon) can be estimated using the following equation:

18 Disinfection
Disinfection is a process to destroy disease-causing organisms,  or
pathogens. Disinfection of water can be done by boiling the water ,
ultraviolet radiation, and chemical inactivation of the pat hogen. In the
water treatment processes, pathogens and other organisms can b e
partly physically eliminated through coagulation, ﬂoccula tion, sedi-
mentation, and ﬁltration, in addition to the natural die-off. After ﬁl-
tration, to ensure pathogen-free water, the chemical addition of 58.51 lb/galw58.34

for disinfection of drinking water. Th is less expensive and powerful dis-
infection of drinking water provides more beneﬁts than its short coming
due to disinfection by-products (DBPs). DBPs have to be controlled. The
use of ozone and ultraviolet for disinfection of water and wastewater
is increasing in the United States.
Chlorination serves not only for disinfection, but as an oxidan t for
other substances (iron, manganese, cyanide, etc.) and for taste and odor
control in water and wastewater. Other chemical disinfectant s include
chlorine dioxide, ozone, bromine, and iodine. The last two chemical s are
generally used for personal application, not for the public wat er supply.
18.1 Chemistry of chlorination
Free available chlorine. Effective chlorine disinfection depends upon its
chemical form in water. The inﬂuencing factors are temperature, pH, and
organic content in the water. When chlorine gas is dissolved i n water, 
it rapidly hydrolyzes to hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlor ous 
acid (HOCl)

The dissolution of gaseous chlorine, Cl2(g), to form dissolved molecu-
lar chlorine, Cl2(aq)follows Henry’s law and can be expressed as (Downs

The distribution of free chlorine between HOCl and OCl/H11002is presented

than that of OCl/H11002(Water, 1978).

Combined available chlorine. Chlorine reacts with certain dissolved con-
stituents in water, such as ammonia and amino nitrogen com pounds to
produce chloramines. These are referred to as combined chlorine. In
the presence of ammonium ions, free chlorine reacts in a stepwise
manner to form three species: monochloramine, NH2Cl; dichloramine,
NHCl2; and trichloramine or nitrogen trichloride, NCl3.

or (5.160)
(5.161)

At high pH, the reaction for forming dichloramine from monochlo-
ramine is not favored. At low pH, other reactions occur as follows :
(5.163)
(5.164)
Free residual chlorine is the sum of [HOCl] and [OCl/H11002]. In practice,
free residual chlorine in water is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L. The term “t otal avail-
able chlorine” is the sum of “free chlorine” and “combined chlori ne.”
Chloramines are also disinfectants, but they are more slower to act
than that of hypochlorite.
Each chloramine molecule reacts with two chlorine atoms. Therefore,
each mole of mono-, di-, and trichloramine contains 71, 142, an d 213 g
of available chlorine, respectively. The molecular weight of these t hreeNH 3Cl11NH 2Cl 4 NHCl 21NH1

ramines contain 1.38, 1.65, and 1.85 g of available chlor ine per gram of
chloramine, respectively.
The pH of the water is the most important factor on the formation of
chloramine species. In general, monochloramine is formed at pH ab ove
7. The optimum pH for producing monochloramine is approximately 8.4.
Breakpoint chlorination. When the molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia
is greater than 1.0, there is a reduction of chlorine and oxid ation of
ammonia. A substantially complete oxidation—reduction process oc curs
in ideal conditions by a 2:1 ratio and results in the dis appearance of all
ammonium ions with excess free chlorine residual. This is call ed the
breakpoint phenomenon. As shown in Fig. 5.11, chlorine reacts with
easily oxidized constituents, such as iron, hydrogen sulﬁde, and some
organic matter. It then continues to oxidize ammonia to form chl o-
ramines and chloroorganic compound below a ratio of 5.0
(which is around the peak). The destruction of chloramines and c hloroor-
ganic compounds are between the ratio of 5.0 and 7.6. The ratio at 7.6
is the breakpoint. All chloramines and other compounds are vi rtually
oxidized. Further addition of chlorine becomes free available chlorin e,
HOCl, and OCl/H11002. At this region, it is called breakpoint chlorination.
The breakpoint chlorination can be used as a means of ammonia
nitrogen removal from waters and wastewaters. The reaction is:

McKee et al. (1960) developed the relationship of available chlorine
in the form of dichloramine to available chlorine in the form of mon o-
chloramine as follows:

The relationship (Eq. (5.168)) is pH dependent. When pH decreases
and the Cl:N dose ratio increases, the relative amount of dichl oramine
also increases.
Example: The treated water has pH of 7.4, a temperature of 25°C, and a free
chlorine residual of 1.2 mg/L.
Chloramine is planned to be used in the distribution system.  How much
ammonia is required to keep the ratio of dichloramine to monochlora mine of
0.15, assuming all residuals are not dissipated yet.

Chlorine dioxide. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is an effective disinfectant (1.4
times that of the oxidation power of chlorine). It is an alternat ive disin-
fectant of potable water, since it does not produce signiﬁcant a mounts of
trihalomethanes (THMs) which chlorine does. Chlorine dioxide has n ot
been widely used for water and wastewater disinfection in the Un ited
States. In western Europe, the use of chlorine dioxide is increas ing.
Chlorine dioxide is a neutral compound of chlorine in the /H11001IV oxida-
tion state, and each mole of chlorine dioxide yields ﬁve redox equi valents
(electrons) on being reduced to chlorine ions. The chemistry of chlori ne
dioxide in water is relatively complex. Under acid conditions , it is
reduced to chloride:

Chlorine dioxide is generally generated at the water treatment
plant prior to application. It is explosive at elevated temper atures and
on exposure of light or in the presence of organic substances. Chl orine
dioxide may be generated by either the oxygeneration of lower-valence
compounds (such as chlorites or chlorous acid) or the reduction of a
more oxidized compound of chlorine. Chlorine dioxide may be gener-
ated by oxidation of sodium chlorite with chlorine gas by the following
reaction.
2NaClO2/H11001Cl2↔2NaCl /H110012ClO2 (5.175)
The above equation suggests that 2 moles of sodium chlorite react with
1 mole of chlorine to produce 2 moles of chlorine dioxide.
Chlorine dioxide is only 60% to 70% pure (James M. Montgomery
Consulting Engineering, 1985). Recent technology has improved it to
in excess of 95%. It is a patented system that reacts gaseous chlorine
with a concentrated sodium chlorite solution under a vacuum.  The
chlorine dioxide produced is then removed from the reaction chamber
by a gas ejector, which is very similar to the chlorine gas  vacuum feed
system. The chlorine dioxide solution concentration is 200 to 10 00 mg/L
and contains less than 5% excess chlorine (ASCE and AWWA, 1 990).
Example: A water treatment plant has a chlorination capacity of 500 kg/d
(1100 lb/d) and is considering the switch to using chlorin e dioxide for disin-
fection. The existing chlorinator would be employed to generate chlor ine diox-
ide. Determine the theoretical amount of chlorine dioxide that can  be

18.2 Ozonation
Ozone (O3) is a blue (or colorless) unstable gas at the temperature and
pressure encountered in water and wastewater treatment processes.  It
has a pungent odor. Ozone is one of the most powerful oxidizing agent s.
It has been used for the purposes of disinfection of water and wast ewater
and chemical oxidation and preparation for biological processi ng, such
as nitriﬁcation.
Ozonation of water for disinfection has been used in France, Germany ,
and Canada. Interest in ozonation in water treatment is incr easing in
the US due to THMs problems of chlorination. Ozone is an allotrope of
oxygen and is generated by an electrical discharge to split the stable
oxygen–oxygen covalent bond as follows:
3O2/H11001energy ↔2O3 (5.176)
The solubility of ozone in water follows Henry’s law. The solubility con-
stant H is (ASCE and AWWA, 1990):
H /H11005(1.29 /H11003106/T)/H110023721 (5.177)
where T is temperature in Kelvin.
The maximum gaseous ozone concentration that can be generated
is approximately 50 mg/L (or 50 g/m3). In practice, the maximum solu-
tion of ozone in water is only 40mg/L (US EPA, 1986). Ozone produc-
tion in ozone generators from air is from 1% to 2 % by weight, and
from pure oxygen ranges from 2% to 10% by weight. One percent by
weight in air is 12.9 g/m3(/H110616000 ppm) and 1% by weight in oxygen
is 14.3 g/m3(/H110616700 ppm). Residual ozone in water is generally 5 2810 lb/d 51276 kg/dy5500 kg/d

18.3 Disinfection kinetics
Although much research has been done on modeling disinfection ki net-
ics, the classical Chick’s law or Chick–Watson model is still commonly
used. Basic models describing the rate of microorganism destru ction or
natural die-off is Chick’s law, a ﬁrst-order chemical reaction :
ln(N/N0)/H11005/H11002kt (5.178a)
or /H11002dN/dt /H11005kt (5.178b)
where N /H11005microbial density present at time t
N0/H11005microbial density present at time 0 (initial)
k /H11005rate constant
t /H11005time
/H11002dN/dt /H11005rate of decrease in microbial density
Watson reﬁned Chick’s equation and develop an empirical equat ion
including changes in the concentration of disinfectant as th e following
relationship:
k /H11005k′Cn(5.179)
where k′/H11005corrected die-off rate, presumably independent of 
C and N
C /H11005disinfection concentration
n /H11005coefﬁcient of dilution
The combination of Eqs. (5.178a) and (5.179) yields
ln(N/N0)/H11005/H11002k′Cnt (5.180a)
or /H11002dN/dt/H11005k′tCn(5.180b)
The disinfection kinetics is inﬂuenced by temperature, and the
Arrhenius model is used for temperature correction as (US EPA, 1 986):
k′T/H11005k′20/H9258(T/H1100220)(5.181)
where k′T/H11005rate constant at temperature T, °C
k′20/H11005rate constant at 20°C 
/H9258/H11005empirical constant
The Chick–Watson relationship can plot the disinfection data of the
survival rate ( N/N0) on a logarithmic scale against time, and a straight474 Chapter 5line can be drawn. However, in practice, most cases do not yiel d a
straight line relationship. Hom (1972) reﬁned the Chick–Watson  model
and developed a ﬂexible, but highly empirical kinetic formati on as fol-
lows:
/H11002dN/dt /H11005k′NtmCn(5.182)
where m /H11005empirical constant

For changing concentrations of the disinfectant, the disinfection  efﬁ-
ciency is of the following form (Fair et al., 1968):
Cntp/H11005constant (5.183)
where tpis the time required to produce a constant percent of kill or di e-
off. This approach has evolved into a “CT” (concentration /H11003contact time)
regulation to ensure a certain percentage kills of Crypotosporidium,
Giardia, and viruses. The percentage kills are expressed in terms of log
removals.
18.4 CTvalues
On June 29, 1989, the US Environmental Protection Agency (198 9b)
published the ﬁnal Surface Water Treatment Regulations (SWTR),
which speciﬁes that water treatment plants using surface w ater as a
source or groundwater under the inﬂuence of surface water, and wi th-
out ﬁltration, must calculate CT values daily. The CT value refers to the
value of disinfectant content or disinfectant residual, C (mg/L), multi-
plied by the contact time, T (minutes, or min). Disinfectants include chlo-
rine, chloramines, ozone, and chlorine dioxide.
Regulations. The US EPA reafﬁrms its commitment to the current Safe
Drinking Water Act, which includes regulations related to disinfection
and pathogenic organism control for water supplies. Public wa ter supply
utilities must continue to comply with current rules while new rules for
microorganisms and disinfectants/disinfection by-products ar e being
developed.
The Surface Water Treatment Rule requires treatment for Giardia
and viruses of all surface water and groundwater under the di rect inﬂu-
ence of surface water. Public water systems are required to comply  with
a new operating parameter, the so-called CT value, an indicator of the
effectiveness of the disinfection process. This parameter depends on pH
and temperature to remove or inactivate Giardia lamblia (a protozoan)
and viruses that could pass through water treatment unit processes.Public Water Supply 475Requirements (US EPA, 1999) for treatment (using the best avail able
technology) such as disinfection and ﬁltration are established  in place
of a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for Giardia, Legionella, het-
erotrophic plate count (HPC), and turbidity. Total treatment of t he
system must achieve at least 99.9% (3-log) removal or inactivat ion of 
G. lamblia cysts and 99.99% (4-log) removal of inactivation of viruses.
To avoid nitration, a system must demonstrate that its dis infection con-
ditions can achieve the above efﬁciencies every day of operation excep t
during any one day each month. Filtered water turbidity mus t at no time
exceed 5 NTU (nephelo-metric turbidity units), and 95 percent of t he tur-
bidity measurements must meet 0.5 NTU for conventional and dir ect ﬁl-
tration and 1.0 NTU for slow sand ﬁltration and diatomaceous  earth
ﬁltration. Turbidity must be measured every 4 h by grab s ampling or
continuous monitoring. Cryptosporidium was not regulated by the
SWTR in 1989 because sufﬁcient data about the organism were la cking
at the time.
The residual disinfectant in ﬁnished water entering the distr ibution
system should not be less than 0.2 mg/L for at least 4 h. The residual
disinfectant at any distribution point should be detectable in 95% of the
samples collected in a month for any two consecutive months. A w ater
plant may use HPC in lieu of residual disinfectant. If HPC is l ess than
500 per 100 mL, the site is considered to have a detectable resi dual for
compliance purposes (US EPA, 1989a).
There are some criteria for avoiding ﬁltration. The water plant m ust
calculate the CT value daily. The water plant using ﬁltration may or may
not need to calculate CT values, depending on state primary require-
ments. The primary agency credits the slow sand ﬁlter, whic h produces
water with turbidity of 0.6 to 0.8 NTU, with 2-log Giardia and virus
removal. Disinfection must achieve an additional 1-log Giardia and
2-log virus removal/inactivation to meet the overall treatment objective.
The Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (US EPA,
1999a) deﬁnes a disinfection proﬁle as a compilation of daily Giardia
and/or virus log inactivations over a period of a year or more (m ay be 
3 years). Inactivation of pathogens is typically reported in orders of
magnitude inactivation of organisms on a logarithmic scale.
The disinfection proﬁle is a graphical representation of the magn itude
of daily Giardia or virus log inactivation that is developed, in part,
based on daily measurements of operational data (disinfectant res idual
concentration, contact time, pH, and temperature). A plot of dail y log
inactivation values versus time provides a visual representa tion of the
log inactivation the treatment system achieved over time. Chan ges in
log inactivation due to disinfectant residual concentrations,  tempera-
ture, ﬂow rate, or other changes can be seen from this plot (US E PA,
1999b).476 Chapter 5Determination of CTvalues. Calculation of CT values is a complicated
procedure depending on the conﬁguration of the whole treatment
system, type and number of point applications, and residual  concen-
tration of disinfectant (Pontius, 1993).
A water utility may determine the inactivation efﬁciency based  on one
point of disinfectant residual measurement prior to the ﬁrst cu stomer,
or on a proﬁle of the residual concentration between the point of dis in-
fectant application and the ﬁrst customer. The ﬁrst customer is the
point at which ﬁnished water is ﬁrst consumed. To determine compli-
ance with the inactivation ( Giardia and viruses) requirements, a water
system must calculate the CT value(s) for its disinfection conditions
during peak hourly ﬂow once each day that it is delivering water to its
ﬁrst customers. To calculate CT value, T is the time (in minutes) that
the water moves, during the peak hourly ﬂow, between the point of dis-
infectant application and the point at which C, residual disinfectant con-
centration, is measured prior to the ﬁrst customer. The residua l
disinfectant concentration, C, pH, and temperature should be meas-
ured each day during peak hourly ﬂow at the efﬂuents of treatmen t
units (each segment or section) and at the ﬁrst customer’s tap . The seg-
ments may include the inﬂow piping system, rapid mixer, ﬂ occulators,
clariﬁers, ﬁlters, clearwells, and distribution systems.
The contact time, T, is between the application point and the point of
residual measured or effective detention time (correction factor from
hydraulic retention time, HRT). The contact time in pipelines ca n be
assumed equivalent to the hydraulic retention time and is ca lculated by
dividing the internal volume of the pipeline by the peak hourly  ﬂow rate
through the pipeline. Due to short circuiting, the contact t ime in mixing
tanks, ﬂocculators, settling basins, clearwells, and other  tankages should
be determined from tracer studies or an equivalent demonstration.  The
time determined from tracer studies to be used for calculating CT is T10.
In the calculation of CT values, the contact time, designated by T10, is
the time needed for 10% of the water to pass through the basin o r reser-
voir. In other words, T10is the time (in minutes) that 90% of the water
(and microorganisms in the water) will be exposed to disinfectan t in the
disinfection contact chamber.
The contact time T10is used to calculate the CT value for each sec-
tion. The CTcalis calculated for each point of residual measurement.
Then the inactivation ratio, CTcal/CT99.9or CTcal/CT99should be calcu-
lated for each section. CT99.9and CT99are the CT values to achieve
99.9% and 99% inactivation, respectively. Total inactivati on ratio is
the sum of the inactivation ratios for each section (sum CTcal/CT99.9). If
the total inactivation ratio is equal to or greater than 1.0 , the system
provides more than 99.9% inactivation of Giardia cysts and meets the
disinfection performance requirement. In fact, many water plant s meetPublic Water Supply 477the CT requirement for 3-log Giardia inactivation because the plant con-
ﬁgurations allow for adequate contact time.
Calculation of CT values is a complicated procedure and depends on
the conﬁguration of the entire treatment system, type and number  of
point applications, and residual concentration of disinfectan t (US EPA,
1999). The water temperature, pH, type and concentration of disin fec-
tant, and effective retention time (ERT) determine the CT values. Flow
patterns and tank conﬁgurations of ﬂocculators, clariﬁers, and clearwells
(location of inﬂuent and efﬂuent pipe, and the bafﬂing condition) affect
the ERT. The ERT is different from the HRT in most instances.
The theoretical contact time, Ttheo, can be determined as (assuming
completely mixed tank):
Ttheo/H11005V/Q (5.184)
where Ttheo/H11005time ( /H11005HRT), minutes (min)
V /H11005volume of tank or pipe, gallons or m3
Q /H11005ﬂow rate, gallons per minute, gpm or m3/s
The ﬂow rate can be determined by a theoretical calculation or b y using
tracer studies. An empirical curve can be developed for T10against Q.
For the distribution pipelines, all water passing through t he pipe is
assumed to have detention time equal to the theoretical (Eq. (5.18 4)) or
mean residence time at a particular ﬂow rate, i.e. ,the contact time is
100% of the time the water remains in the pipe.
In mixing basins, storage reservoirs, and other treatment pl ant
process units, the water utility is required to determine the contact
time for the calculation of the CT value through tracer studies or other
methods approved by the primacy agency, such as the state E PA.
The calculation of contact time T for treatment units is not a
straightforward process of dividing the volume of tank or basin  by the
ﬂow through rate (Eq. 5.184). Only a partial credit is gi ven to take into
account short circuiting that occurs in tanks without b affles. The
instructions on calculating the contact time (out of the scope of this
manual) are given in Appendix C of the Guidance Manual (US E PA,
1989a).
Bafﬂing is used to maximize utilization of basin volume, increa se the
plug ﬂow zone in the basin, and to minimize short circuiting . Some form
of bafﬂing is installed at the inlet and outlet of the basin t o evenly dis-
tribute ﬂow across the basin. Additional bafﬂing may be in stalled within
the interior of the basin. Bafﬂing conditions generally are cla ssiﬁed as
poor, average, or superior and are based on results of tracer stu dies for
use in determining T10from the theoretical detention time of a tank. The
T10/T fractions associated with various degrees of bafﬂing conditions are478 Chapter 5shown in Table 5.7. In practice, theoretical T10/T values of 1.0 for plug
ﬂows and 0.1 for mixed ﬂow are seldom achieved due to the effect of dea d
space. Superior bafﬂing conditions consist of at least a bafﬂed  inlet and
outlet, and possibly some intrabasin bafﬂing to redistribut e the ﬂow
throughout the basin’s cross section. Average bafﬂing conditi ons include
intrabasin bafﬂing and either a bafﬂed inlet or outlet. Poor ba fﬂing con-
ditions refer to basins without intrabasin bafﬂing and unb afﬂed inlets
and outlets.
The procedure to determine the inactivation capability of a water  plant
is summarized as follows (US EPA, 1989a, 1990, 1999; IEPA , 1992):
1. Determine the peak hourly ﬂow rate (Q in gpm) for each day from
monitoring records.
2. Determine hydraulic detention time: HRT /H11005T /H11005V/Q.
3. Calculate the contact time ( T10) for each disinfection segment based
on bafﬂing factors or tracer studies.
4. Find correction factor, T10/T, look at the actual bafﬂing conditions
to obtain T10from Table 5.6.
5. Compute effective retention time (ERT) /H11005HRT /H11003(T10/T).
6. Measure the disinfectant residual: C in mg/L (with pH, and tem-
perature in °C) at any number of points within the treatment train
during peak hourly ﬂow (in gpm).
7. Calculate CT value ( CTcal) for each point of residual measurement
(using ERT for T) based on actual system data.
8. Find CT99.9or CT99.99value from Tables 5.7 or 5.9 (from Appendix E
of the Manual, US EPA, 1989a) based on water temperature, pH,
residual disinfectant concentration, and log10removal /H110053 or 4.Public Water Supply 479

SOURCE : Table C-5 of the US EPA Guidance Manual (US EPA, 1989a)9. Compute the inactivation ratio, CTcal/CT99.9and CTcal/CT99.99for
Giardia and viruses, respectively.
10. Calculate the estimated log inactivation by multiplyin g the ratio
of step 9 by 3 for Giardia and by 4 for viruses, because CT99.9
and CT99.99 are equivalent to 3-log and 4-log inactivations, 
respectively.
11. Sum the segment log inactivation of Giardia and viruses (such as
rapid mixing tanks, ﬂocculators, clariﬁers, ﬁlters, clea rwell, and
pipelines) to determine the plant total log inactivations due t o
disinfection.
12. Determine whether the inactivations achieved are adequate. I f the
sum of the inactivation ratios is greater than or equal to one,  the
required 3-log inactivation of Giardia cysts and 4-log viruses inac-
tivation have been achieved.
13. The total percent of inactivation can be determined as:
y /H11005100 /H11002100/10x(5.185)
where y /H11005% inactivation
x /H11005log inactivation
Tables 5.8 and 5.9 present the CT values for achieving 99.9% and
99% inactivation of G. lamblia. Table 5.10 presents CTvalues for
achieving 2-, 3-, and 4-log inactivation of viruses at pH 6 t hrough 9
(US EPA, 1989b). The SWTR Guidance Manual did not include CT
values at pH above 9 due to the limited research results avail able at
the time of rule promulgation. In November 1997, a new set of pro-
posed rules was developed for the higher pH values, up to pH of 11.5
(Federal Register, 1997).

tion and prior to the clearwell. The 4-in (10 cm) transmission pipeline to the
ﬁrst customer is 1640 ft (500 m) in distance. The residual c hlorine concen-
trations in the clearwell and the distribution main are 1. 6 and 1.0 mg/L,
respectively. The volume of the clearwell is 70,000 gal (265 m3). Determine
Giardia inactivation at a water temperature of 10°C at the peak hour ﬂow of
100 gpm.
solution:
Step 1.
An overall inactivation of 3 logs for Giardia and 4 logs for viruses is
required. The Primacy Agency can credit the slow sand ﬁlter p rocess, which
produces water with turbidity ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 NTU,  with a 2-log
Giardia and virus inactivation. For this example, the water system meets
the turbidity standards. Thus, disinfection must achieve a n additional Public Water Supply 481

In practice, the minimum volume available in the clearwell during the
peak demand period is approximately one-half of the working volume
(Illinois EPA, 1992). Thus, one-half of the clearwell volume (240,0 00 gal)

Note : Total viruses inactivation is well above 1.
The water system meets the viruses inactivation requirement.490 Chapter 5In summary, a brief description of regulations in the United States and
determination of CT values are presented. Under the SWTR, all surface
water supplies and groundwater supplies that are under the inﬂuence
of surface water must calculate CT values daily during peak hourly
ﬂow. A minimum of 3-log Giardia lamblia and 4-log virus removal and/or
inactivation performance must be achieved at all times to comp ly with
the existing SWTR. The CT values are used to evaluate the achievement
of disinfection and to determine compliance with the SWTR. They als o
are used to compute the log inactivation of Giardia and viruses during
water treatment and to construct a disinfection proﬁle.
To calculate the CT value, operation data, e.g. disinfectant concen-
tration, water pH, and water temperature, should be measured d aily
during the peak hourly ﬂow. Contact time ( T10), actual calculated CT
value ( CTcal), 3-log Giardia inactivation ( CT99.9from Table 5.7), and/or
4-log virus inactivation (from Table 5.9), CTcal/CT99.9, and CTcal/CT99.99
should be calculated for the estimated segment log inactivation s. The
total plant log inactivation is the sum of all segment log i nactivations.
The daily log inactivation values can be used to develop a dis infection
proﬁle for the treatment system.
18.5 Disinfection by-products
Water disinfection and its by-products. Chlorine has been widely used as
a disinfectant in water treatment process to kill or inactiv ate waterborne
pathogens. Chlorine disinfection of public drinking water had  dramati-
cally reduced outbreaks of illness. In 1974, chloroform (trichl oromethane)
was discovered as a disinfection by-product (DBP) resulting from the
interaction of chlorine with natural organic matter in water . This ﬁnd-
ing raised a serious dilemma that water chlorination clearl y reduced the
risk of infectious diseases and might also result in the format ion of poten-
tially harmful DBP with this exposure in drinking water. DBP problem
is currently most concerned by water supply professionals.
Chlorine, chlorine dioxide, chloramines, ozone, and potassium per -
manganate are used in US water treatment plants as a disi nfectant.
Table 5.11 lists some of the microorganisms targeted by disin fection
practice and some of more appropriate disinfectants for each micr oor-
ganism. Based on the types of disinfectants used, the numbers of water
supplies are roughly (keep changing) 22,000 (91.6%), 360 (1.5%),  140
(0.6%), 300 (1.3%), and 1200 (5.0%), respectively. The disinfectant s are
often so powerful that they nonselectively react with other substa nces
in the water. There are actually thousands of DBPs. When natura l
waters are disinfected, more than 100 potentially toxic halogen ated
compounds can be created (Gray et al. , 2001). The compounds of concern
are halogenated methanes, haloacetic acids, and nitrosamines.Public Water Supply 491Two classes of DBPs that dominate the identiﬁable organic matt er;
trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (haloacetates, HAAs) a re
of regulatory interest. THMs are a group of compounds with three ha lo-
gen atoms. Only chlorinated and brominated ones are routinely found
in potable water. Chloroform (CHCl3) is one of a class of compounds of
THMs. In the United States, since 1974, additional DBPs hav e been
identiﬁed in potable water and concerns have intensiﬁed about health
risks resulting from exposures to them. Along with chloroform, t hree
species that are of most concern are bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl2),
dibromochloromethane (CHBr2Cl), and tribromomethane (bromoform,
CHBr3). The above four species are called trihalomethanes. The sum of
these four species is expressed as total trihalomethanes (TTHMs). THMs
are regulated under the Stage 2 DBP rule (Table 5.11).
HAAs (Table 5.12) are also formed during chlorination of water. Li ke
THMs, HAAs are also linked with increased incidence of cancer in  lab-
oratory animals (Herren-Freund et al. , 1987; Xu et al. , 1995). Unlike
THMs, HAAs are capable of dissociating in water. HAAs are >99% i on-
ized (deprotonated) to the haloacetate anions under drinking water con-
ditions. However, they are regulated and usually reported in ter ms of
the parent acids rather than the carboxylate anions (US EPA , 2001).
HAAs account for about 13% of the halogenated organic matter after dis-
infection (Weinberg, 1999). 
Bromate is formed from the ozonation of source waters that contain
bromide. In ozonated water supplies, a variety of aldehydes and ketones
abound as well as some carboxylic acids. In addition to th ese organic
products, inorganic species are also found. These include oxyani ons of
halogens, such as chlorite, chlorate, and bromate, which ca n be formed
by a variety of oxidizing disinfectants. Bromate is of particu lar interest
since it is suspected of posing one of the highest cancer risks of any DBP
(US EPA, 2001).492 Chapter 5

have been regulated and/or subjected to monitoring rules aimed t o meet
the simultaneous goal of disinfecting water and controlling DB Ps. Table
5.13 presents regulated compounds along with their important  infor-
mation. It should be noted that only a very small subset of t he much
larger list of substances have been identiﬁed as DBPs.
The Stage 2 DBP rule issued in January 2006, had (1) lowered t he
TTHMs MCL 0.10 to 0.08 mg/L; (2) established an MCL of 0.06 mg/L
for ﬁve haloacetic acids (HAA5), including, monochloroacetic aci d,
dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, monobromoacetic aci d, and dibro-
moacetic acid; (3) added an MCLG of 0.07 mg/L for (mono)chloroacetic
acid; (4) established an MCL of 0.010 mg/L for bromate; and (5) es tablished
an MCL of 1.0 mg/L for chlorite.
Control of DBPs and pathogens. US EPA’s current drinking water research
program (in-house/contracted) is more sophisticated than it was  in the
1980s. For example, when the treatment technology manual was p ub-
lished in 1981, it reported primarily on treatment-oriented res earch.
Twenty-ﬁve years later, the technology research program includes  source
water protection, treatment technology, and distribution syst em studies.
The research also reﬂects a concern over balancing the risks of p otential
carcinogenic exposure against the risks from microbial infecti on.
Techniques for controlling DBPs and waterborne pathogens below ha ve
mostly followed the US EPA (2001) report.  The controlling techniqu es
include source protection, treatment process modiﬁcation (enhanced
coagulation), alternative disinfectants, activated carbon, ot her granu-
lar ﬁltration, membrane ﬁltration process, control in drink ing water
distribution system, etc.Public Water Supply 493

SOURCE : US EPS, 2001; www.epa.gov/OGWDW/regs.html, 2007Source water protection. Many of the drinking water utilities in the
United States had invested a great deal of time, energy, and c apital
into source water protection (SWP). In addition, efforts were made to
develop mechanisms for protection against the impact of sudden
changes in inﬂuent water quality. Some of these mechanisms in clude
investment in excess capacity and development of emergency
procedures. 
Source water protection measures are the important step to prevent
contamination and reduce the need for treatment of drinking water
supplies. SWP includes managing potential contamination sour ces
and developing contingency plans that identify alternate dri nking
water sources. A community may decide to develop an SWP program
based on the results of a source water assessment, which inclu des
delineation of the area to be protected and an inventory of the poten-
tial contaminants within that area. SWP from quality degra dation by
microbial contaminants (i.e. bacteria, protozoa, viruses, helm inthes,
and fungi) is any activity undertaken to minimize the frequenc y, mag-
nitude, and duration of occurrence of pathogens or indicators (e.g .
indicator microorganisms, such as TC, FC, and FS (Lin, 2002 ); or tur-
bidity) in source waters. SWP may also, by reducing the concen tra-
tion of natural organic matter (NOM), a DBP precursor, reduce t he
formation of DBP.
SWP strategies comprise the ﬁrst stage in the multiple-barrier
approach to protecting the quality of drinking water. Other major
drinking-water-quality protection barriers include water qua lity mon-
itoring and selective source withdrawal, water treatment proc esses for
removal or inactivation of pathogens and control of DBP formation,
water distribution practices for preventing intrusion or regr owth of
pathogens, and point-of-use treatment where required. 
SWP strategies are a speciﬁc subset of a large watershed protecti on
strategy applied when the protected receiving water is used as  a water
supply. Conceptually, watershed protection is heavily linked  to pollution
prevention, contaminant source identiﬁcation, and risk mana gement.
Although watershed management does not have a universally acc epted
deﬁnition and connotes alternate approaches, each interpretation  has
an underpinning of holistic approaches to prevent or mitigate threats
to the receiving water over a geographic region deﬁned by a common
hydrology. 
Many groundwater supplies have proven to be vulnerable as well , result-
ing in various states implementing wellhead protection progra ms. The
1986 amendments included provisions for Protection of Ground Water
Sources of Water. Two programs were set up under this requirement : the
“Sole Source Aquifer Demonstration program,” to establish demonst ration
programs to protect critical aquifer areas from degradation; a nd thePublic Water Supply 495“Wellhead Protection Program,” which required states to develop pr o-
grams for protecting areas around public water supply wells  to prevent con-
tamination from residential, industrial, and farming-use ac tivities.
In the 1996 amendments to the SDWA, protection of source waters
was given greater emphasis to strengthen protection against m icrobial
contaminants, particularly Cryptosporidium, while reducing potential
health risks due to DBPs. Two major threats to source water qu ality with
respect to DBP control and microbial protection are natural org anic
matter and microbial  pathogens. From a waterborne outbreak an d
public health viewpoint, both Giardia and Cryptosporidium are cur-
rently of primary concern. 
Managing microbial contaminant risks in watersheds requi res iden-
tiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of organisms. Because of difﬁcult ies in asso-
ciation with assaying for speciﬁc pathogens, monitoring prog rams have
been tested for indicator organisms, including total coliform (TC ), fecal
coliform (FC), and fecal streptococcus (FS), to identify possible fecal
contamination in water. The analytical methods for indicators  are easier,
faster, and more cost effective than methods for speciﬁc pathogenic
organisms. The limitations of relying on indicator organisms for deter-
mining the presence of pathogens include the occurrence of false posi -
tives and the fact that indicators measure bacteria that l ive not only in
human enteric tracts, but also in the enteric tracts of other  animals
(Toranzos and McFeters, 1997; Lin, 2002). 
The potential sources of microbial pathogens in source water are m any
and varied, including nonpoint runoff, discharges from treated  and
untreated wastewaters, storm water runoff, and combined sewer over -
ﬂows. Animal feed lot is the main source of Cryptosporidium. Many fac-
tors affect the types of organisms found and the concentrations at  which
they are detected. These include watershed contributions, treatmen t plant
efﬁciency, and length of antecedent dry weather period. These treatm ent
technologies can be both sources of contamination as well as prot ection of
source water quality. In addition to the installation of was tewater treat-
ment and combined overﬂow systems, there are passive pollution p re-
vention and mitigation techniques called BMPs. The BMP techniq ues can
be found elsewhere (US EPA, 1990, 1992) and vary dramaticall y in appli-
cation, ranging from social practices to engineering applica tions.
In summary, long-term and effective management for pathogens and
DBP is source water protection to control NOM, the DBP precursor.
SWP includes effective watershed protection and water resources man-
agement strategies. It involves controlling algal growth and  the pro-
duction of organic carbon precursors in our raw water sources (lakes and
rivers) by limiting nutrient discharges into these bodies of w ater. 
Once NOM is controlled, there would be beneﬁts to the water treat ment
system, such as less pretreatment and easier down-stream treat ment,496 Chapter 5more effective unit process, and cheaper water treatment costs. Coa gulant
dosage requirements will be reduced and then less sludge will be produced
if there is less dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the raw wat er, because,
for most waters, the concentration of DOC controls coagulant dosa ge
requirements. Chlorine dioxide doses will be lowered if there is les s DOC
in the raw water to consume chlorine dioxide and generate chlori te.
Powdered and/or granular activated carbon dosage rates for the c ontrol
of taste- and odor-causing organic compounds will be reduced if t here is
less DOC in the raw water to compete with these target tracin g organic
pollutants for adsorption sites on the activated carbon. Membr ane foul-
ing will be lowered and ultraviolet irradiation for microbial  inactivation
will be more effective if there are less DOC and ultraviolet-adsorbi ng
organics in the raw water. Less chlorine will be required for d isinfection,
and lower concentrations of all halogenated organic by-products—n ot
just the THMs and HAAs—will be formed (Singer, 2006).
Use of alternative disinfectants. As discussed previously, chlorination of
drinking water results in the formation of numerous DBPs, severa l of
which are regulated. Water systems seeking to meet MCLs for regul ated
DBPs might consider various approaches to limiting DBPs suc h as
removing precursor compounds before the disinfectant is applied, using
less chlorine, using alternative disinfectants to chlorine, or  removing
DBPs after their formation. Combinations of these approaches might
also be considered. As mentioned previously, removing DBPs after t heir
formation is a method that is generally not considered, but no matter
which approach is selected, the effectiveness of the disinfection pr ocess
must not be jeopardized.
Studies have been conducted by or funded by the US EPA’s Ofﬁce of
Research and Development in Cincinnati to examine the use of thr ee
alternative oxidants: chloramines, chlorine dioxide (ClO2), and ozone.
Chloramines. Based on the researches cited (Steven et al., 1989;
Miltner, 1990), the formation of halogen-containing DBPs by chlo-
ramines is signiﬁcantly lower than by free chlorine. An excep tion is the
formation of cyanogens chloride with chloramination. Formation of n on-
halogenated DBPs such as aldehydes and assimilable organic carbon
(AOC) is found to be minimal with chloramination.
Chloramines are the second most commonly used ﬁnal disinfectant  in
drinking water treatment after free chlorine. Although generally  not as
effective a disinfectant as free chlorine, an advantage of chlorami nation
is minimization of the formation of DBPs.
Chlorine dioxide. Chlorine dioxide is another widely used disinfec-
tant in drinking water treatment. It has long been used for taste and
odor control and for iron and manganese control, and has gained  in
acceptance as an effective disinfectant. Public Water Supply 497An advantage of ClO2treatment is minimization of the formation of
DBPs; it does this by oxidation of DBP precursors and by relat ively
minimal formation of DBPs themselves. The formation of DBPs by ClO2
is also signiﬁcantly lower than with free chlorine and with  chloramines
(Stevens et al., 1989). ClO2oxidizes DBP precursors in the treated water
to the extent that lower concentrations of DBPs are formed with sub -
sequent chlorination. Using ClO2results in the formation of nonhalo-
genated DBPs such as aldehydes, ketones, and AOC.
The use of ClO2can result in the formation of chlorite and chlorate.
Chlorite can be controlled by GAC and through the use of reduci ng
agents. Sulﬁte and metabisulﬁte can reduce chlorite, but ma y form chlo-
rate. Thiosulfate can reduce chlorite without forming chlorate. Fer rous
ion can reduce chlorate, but pH adjustment is required to min imize
chlorate formation. The use of a reducing agent like thiosulfate or fer-
rous ion can complicate the application of postdisinfectants.
Ozone. Ozone is a less commonly used disinfectant in drinking water
treatment in the United States. Among the many beneﬁts of ozonati on
of drinking water are effective inactivation of microbes, taste an d odor
control, iron and manganese control, oxidation of DBP precursors,  and
the enhancement of biological oxidation in filters. However, ozone
results in the formation of bromate and of biodegradable organic m atter
(BOM). Bromate is regulated under the D/DBP Rule. BOM includes
ozonation by-products (OBPs) like aldehydes, keto acids, carboxyli c
acids, AOC, and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDO C). These
OBPs may be responsible for regrowth of bacteria in distribution  sys-
tems and can be controlled in-plant if biological oxidation is  allowed to
occur in downstream ﬁlters. (Refer to the section of DBP control thr ough
biological ﬁltration.) 
The formation of halogen-containing DBPs by ozone is signiﬁcantly
lower than that by free chlorine. Ozone can form bromo-DBPs like bro-
moform (CHBr3), bromoacetic acid, and dibromoacetic acid, but at rel-
atively low concentrations. Ozone oxidizes DBP precursors such th at
lower concentrations of TTHM, HAA6, HAN4 (haloacetonitrile 4), and
TOX (total organic halide) are formed with subsequent chlorinati on.
However, preozonation alters the nature of the precursors to the extent
that higher concentrations of chloral hydrate, chloropicrin, and 1,1,1-TCP
are formed with subsequent chlorination (Miltner, 1990).
Ozone converts portions of the humic fraction to nonhumic com-
pounds and converts portions of the higher-molecular-weight fracti on
to lower-molecular-weight compounds. Examples of lower-molecular-
weight materials formed by ozone are aldehydes, keto acids, AOC, and
BDOC. Concentrations of these may be appreciable and necessitat e
control to ensure distribution system biostability. Generally , much of498 Chapter 5the formation of these OBPs occurs at lower ozone doses. Ozone stag-
ing (when it is applied in the treatment plant) can inﬂuenc e OBP for-
mation. Ozonation of raw water results in higher OBP formation t han
ozonation of downstream waters in which some ozone demand has been
removed (Miltner, 1993).
NOM and bromide are the two principal precursors of DBPs in r aw
water supplies. Bromate can result from the use of ozone. Bromate con -
centration increases with increasing dissolved ozone residual a nd with
increasing bromide. Bromide control strategies may involve more energy-
intensive membrane processes, such as RO. Singer (2006) pointed  out
that source water protection involves creative solutions to mini mizing
saltwater intrusion into our raw (surface and ground) water s upplies
because such saltwater intrusion is the primary source of br omide.
Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Carlson et al. (1985) reported that cysts
of Giardia muris were signiﬁcantly more resistant to UV treatment
than E. coli or Yersinia spp. Results suggested that hydraulic short cir-
cuiting and entrapped air in UV reactors may decrease the efﬁ ciency of
inactivation. G. lamblia cysts were found to be resistant to high doses
of germicidal UV irradiation (Rice and Hoff, 1981). There has been
renewed interest in the use of UV light for inactivating waterb orne pro-
tozoan parasites. A study suggested that UV irradiation is an effective
treatment option for inactivating oocysts of Crytosporidium (Clancy et al.,
1998). UV irradiation was not considered for controlling DBP.  Currently,
due to the improvement of technology, UV has been commercially ava il-
able to be used to control DBP.
Enhanced coagulation. Coagulation has historically been used for the
control of particulates in drinking water, while simultaneou sly con-
trolling organic carbon. With the D/DBP Rule, many water s ystems
will move from conventional to enhanced coagulation and expand t heir
coagulation objectives from removing turbidity to removing total
organic carbon (TOC) as well. It is anticipated that many systems will
be able to meet the requirements of enhanced coagulation for TOC
removal with only moderate changes in conventional coagulation.
Making the change from conventional to TOC-optimized coagulation
generally results in improved removal of heterotrophic plate count
(HPC) bacteria, TC, FC, FS, viruses, Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts
(3.1 to 7.0 µm), Cryptosporidium oocyst-sized particles, Giardia cyst-
sized particles (8.2 to 13.2 µm), total plate count (TPC) organis ms, and
bacterial endospores.
The removal of TOC results in improved removal of precursors for
TTHM, HAA6, CH, HAN4, CP, the surrogate TOX, and chlorine demand
(Miltner, 1994; Dryfuse et al., 1995). When coagulated, raw watersPublic Water Supply 499higher in TOC and in speciﬁc ultraviolet absorbance tend to have higher
percent removals of DBP precursors. As a treatment technique,
enhanced coagulation to remove TOC can result in the removal of pr e-
cursors for these DBPs. As a BAT, enhanced coagulation can res ult in
the control of TTHM and HAA5. Many systems should be able to meet
the requirements of enhanced coagulation for TOC removal with mod-
erate changes to conventional coagulation.
Most DOC and DBP precursors are in the larger-molecular-size ran ge
and are in the humic fraction. Conventional coagulation removes  a
greater percentage of the >3K MS (molecular size) fraction than the
smaller-sized fractions. Enhancing coagulation brings about small
improvements in the >3K MS range and the <0.5K MS range; the great-
est improvement with enhanced coagulation is in the 0.5K to 3 K MS
range (Dryfuse et al., 1995). Conventional coagulation removes a greater
percentage of the humic fraction than the nonhumic fraction. En hancing
coagulation brings about similar improvement in the removal of both
fractions.
A general concern associated with coagulation is that, althou gh it
lowers the concentrations of DBP precursor, it shifts the distri bution of
the DBPs formed by chlorination toward the more brominated species .
This shift becomes even greater when enhanced or optimized coagula-
tions practiced.
Water systems switching from conventional to enhanced coagulat ion
may achieve longer ﬁlter run times (FRTs), but the trade-off will be
greater amounts of sludge production. Systems practicing enha nced
coagulation should also consider pH adjustment ahead of the ﬁlt er to
achieve longer FRTs. The disadvantage with enhanced coagulation  is
that when alum is the coagulant, higher levels of dissolved a luminum
will enter the distribution system.
Filtration. The US EPA researches have been conducted with the use
of bench-, pilot-, and ﬁeld-scale studies to investigate various aspects of
surface water ﬁltration for microbiological removal with variou s gran-
ular media. Studies found that two of these technologies, slow sa nd ﬁl-
tration (SSF) and diatomaceous earth (DE) ﬁltration, are especial ly
applicable to small systems. In addition, the application  of granular ﬁl-
tration, which is utilized by medium to large systems, has  been inves-
tigated for removal of Giardia and Cryptosporidium. These studies have
considered the various operational conditions that enhance remova l
efﬁciency as well as the conditions under which removal efﬁcienc y
deteriorates.
In the period between 1980 and 1990, Giardia cysts and
Cryptosporidium oocysts were the primary organisms being considered.
The effect of various water quality conditions and particle and pathogen500 Chapter 5loadings were evaluated. It was shown that, in combination with effec-
tive chemical addition and coagulation, these processes are ca pable of
efﬁciently removing efﬁciency in SSF and conventional ﬁltration,  but had
little effect n DE performance. Filtration processes are capable of r emov-
ing high levels of those organisms, but that removal is depend ent on the
operation of those processes. Poor chemical addition and coagulation
reduced the treatment efﬁciency for removing microorganism and oth er
particles. Temperature was another factor that affected removal. The ﬁl-
tration studies conducted by US EPA concluded that good turb idity
reduction and good particle removal paralleled good microorganis m
removal.
One measure of ﬁltration efﬁciency developed by Water Supply and
Water Resources Division (WSWRD), and now widely used, was that  of
measuring aerobic endospore removal in a water treatment process.
Although not a surrogate for removal of a speciﬁc organism, endos pore
removal was seen as a measure of the overall ﬁltration performance.
Studies conducted by the WSWRD showed that endospore removal
tracked particle removal, turbidity reduction, and pathogen  removal. In
studies, if good removal of endospores was achieved, good removal of pa r-
ticle and pathogens was observed. In some cases, good removal of
pathogens occurred when poor removal of endospores was demonstrated,
but no studies showed poor removal of pathogens when good removal
of spores was achieved. Thus, removal of spores may be considered a con-
servative measure of particle and pathogen removal.
Biological ﬁltration for DBP control. DBP control through biological ﬁltra-
tion or bioﬁltration is deﬁned as the removal of DBP precursor ma te-
rial (PM) by bacteria attached to the ﬁlter media. Dissolved or ganic
matter (DOM), which is a part of the PM, is utilized by the ﬁ lter bacte-
ria as a substrate for cell maintenance, growth, and replic ation. This
effect makes the PM utilized by bacteria unavailable to react wi th chlo-
rine to form DBPs. The prerequisite for maximizing bacterial subs trate
utilization in ﬁlters is the absence of chlorine in the ﬁlter i nﬂuent or
backwash water.
Sand, anthracite, or GAC can be colonized by bacteria. Sinc e
anthracite and sand are considered inert because neither inter acts
chemically with PM, removal of PM is due solely to biological ac tivity.
GAC will initially remove DOM through adsorption and biolog ical sub-
strate utilization until its adsorptive capacity has been exhausted. After
that point, PM removal is achieved only through substrate ut ilization,
and the GAC is deﬁned as biological activated carbon (BAC). All drink-
ing water ﬁlters will become biologically active in the absen ce of applied
disinfectant residuals. The process of biological colonization and  sub-
strate utilization is enhanced by ozonating ﬁlter inﬂuent wat er.Public Water Supply 501Data collected, to date, indicate that biologically active ﬁ lters remove
signiﬁcant amounts of PM and that preozonated bioﬁlters remove mor e
PM than do nonozonated ﬁlters. The resulting reductions in tri-
halomethane formation potential (THMFP) and haloacetic acid forma-
tion potential (HAAFP) should help many drinking water utiliti es meet
the 80 (THM) and 60 (HAA) /H9262g/L limits mandated under the Stage II
D/DBP Rule (US EPA, 2001).
Use of GAC. GAC can be used as part of a multimedia ﬁlter to remove
particulates (ﬁlter adsorber) or a postﬁlter to remove speciﬁc con tami-
nants (postﬁlter adsorber). When used in a ﬁlter adsorber mode, t he ﬁl-
ters are backwashed periodically to alleviate head loss, but the carbon
itself is regenerated infrequently, it at all. When used in a p ostﬁlter
mode, the carbon bed is rarely backwashed and is regenerated a s often
as needed to control the contaminant(s) of interest.
Activated carbon in a ﬁlter adsorber application removes pat hogens by
the same mechanisms as any other ﬁlter media. It does not remov e par-
ticulates/pathogens to any greater degree than other ﬁlter media  types;
so, it is never recommended for particulate/pathogen removal alone.  
Activated carbon is an effective process for removing DBP precur-
sors. It is not designed for pathogen removal. The effectiveness for pr e-
cursor removal is dependent on a number of design issues such a s carbon
type, ﬁlter location, ﬁlter depth, ﬁlter ﬂow rate, and blendi ng choices.
It is also dependent on a number of water quality issues such  as initial
precursor concentration, precursor adsorbility, precursor ads orption
kinetics, temperature, dissolved oxygen levels, pH, and bromide con-
centration. Although much progress has been made on the modelin g
of GAC system performance, the applicability of this technolog y to any
drinking water utility will need to be determined by pilot t esting 
(US EPA, 2001).
Use of membranes. Certain type of membranes can be very effective for
controlling DBPs, while others are speciﬁcally designed to remov e par-
ticulates/pathogens. For example, reverse osmosis (RO) membranes ar e
very tight and are typically used to remove salts from seawat er and
brackish waters. Due to their tight membrane structure, th ey require
high pressures to operate effectively.
Nonoﬁltration (NF) membranes are not as tight as RO membranes,
but have been found to remove a large percentage of DBP precursors.
Because they are not as tight, they can be operated at lower pr essures
(typically 5 to 9 bars) than RO membranes while achieving the same,
or greater, ﬂux. Ultraﬁltration (UF) and microﬁltration (MF) mem -
branes are typically used for particulate/pathogen removal onl y. Details
of MF, UF, NF, and RO are discussed in the membrane ﬁltrat ion section.502 Chapter 5Speth (1998) concludes that activated carbon is an effective pr ocess
for removing DBP precursors, but is not effective for pathogen removal .
RO and NF are effective processes for removing DBP precursors, and
UF and MF membranes are excellent for removing pathogens and par-
ticulates and, under some conditions, could be considered as a  replace-
ment for conventional ﬁltration.
Membrane technologies are effective processes for removing DBP pre-
cursors. As stated above, MF and UF membranes are excellent for r emov-
ing pathogens. NF and RO membranes are excellent for removing DB P
precursors, but are not counted on as a pathogen barrier due t o blending
and glue-line-failure issues. These problems have been overcome by new
membrane technologies. Reducing the effect of membrane foulants is a
main consideration in the design of NF and RO plants, especia lly for plants
treating surface waters. Although much progress has been mad e on mod-
eling and scaling up small-membrane results, the applicab ility of this
technology will need to be determined by pilot testing (US EPA, 2001).
For small systems. Small water supply systems have many problems
that make compliance with drinking water standards more d ifﬁcult
than for medium and large systems. The pilot- and full-scale res earch
efforts have been made to address some of these needs. Because small
systems often lack of the ﬁnancial, technical, and manageria l capabili-
ties of larger systems and are responsible for the majority of the SDWA
violations, they have been targeted in several federal rules and
regulations.
Filtration and disinfection of water supplies are highly effectiv e
public health practices. EPA’s in-house research has focused prima-
rily on ﬁltration and disinfection technologies that are consi dered to
be viable alternatives to conventional package plants (ﬂoccula tion,
coagulation, media ﬁltration, postchlorination). Conventional package
plants are site-speciﬁc and require a high level of operator ski ll to
properly maintain appropriate chemical dosage and ﬂow rates,  espe-
cially when used to treat surface water. These difficulties, in con-
junction with the other small system problems, have results.  Field
demonstration projects have been used to characterize some of the
problems that can occur for even the best technology when conditi ons
are not optimal. The remote monitoring and control research efforts
result from the fact that many rural systems are located in topo-
graphically difﬁcult areas or separated by large distances  from other
systems, thus precluding any consolidation or regionalization  efforts.
The software and sensing systems developed as a product of this
research will allow individual treatment units to be monitor ed and
operated from a certain location. This approach is called the electric
circuit rider concept. One technique that has promise for improvingPublic Water Supply 503the effectiveness of systems in the ﬁeld is the use of supervisory con -
trol and data acquisition system (US EPA, 2001).
Results from the EPA research indicate that MF, UF, and RO sys-
tems are effective technologies for the removal of pathogens while still
being affordable for small systems. New disinfection technologies
appear to provide improvements over current systems in handlin g
chemicals and consistency of performance. This is an area under going
rapid change. Many organisms are readily removed and inact ivated in
the laboratory, but under field conditions, the same effectiveness
cannot be taken for granted.
Control in distribution system. Virtually for any surface contact with the
water in a distribution system, one can ﬁnd bioﬂilms. Bioﬁ lms are formed
in distribution system pipelines when microbial cells atta ch to pipe sur-
face and multiply to form a ﬁlm or slime layer on the pipe. Prob ably
within seconds of entering the distribution system, large par ticles, includ-
ing microorganisms, adsorb to the clean pipe surface. Some mic roor-
ganisms can adhere directly to the pipe surface via appendag es that
extend from the cell membrane; other bacteria form a capsular ma terial
of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), sometimes called a glycoc alyx,
that anchors the bacteria to the pipe surface (Geldreich, 1988 ). The
organisms take advantage of the macromolecules attached to the p ipe
surface for protection and nourishment. The water ﬂowing past ca rries
nutrients (carbon-containing molecules, as well as other elements ) that
are essential for the organisms’ survival and growth (US EPA,  1992).
Bioﬁlms are complex and dynamic microenvironments, encompassi ng
processes such as metabolism, growth, and product formation, and
ﬁnally detachment, erosion, or “soughing” of the bioﬁlm from the sur-
face. The rate of bioﬁlm formation and its release into a distribu tion
system can be affected by many factors, including surface lay ers begin
to slough off into the water (Geldreich and Rice, 1987). The pieces of
bioﬁlm released into the water may continue to provide protection for
the organisms until they can colonize a new section of the distr ibution
system.
The most common organisms found in bioﬁlms are nonpathogenic het-
erotrophic bacteria. Some bacteria that live in bioﬁlms may cause esthetic
problems with water quality, including off-tastes, odors, and  colored water
problems. Few organisms living in distribution system bioﬁl ms pose a
threat to the average consumer. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, prot ozoa, and
other invertebrates have been isolated from drinking water bioﬁlm s (US
EPA, 1992). The fact that such organisms are present within  distribution
system bioﬁlms shows that, although water treatment is int ended to
remove all pathogenic bacteria, treatment does not produce a ster ile
water. Consequently, if opportunistic pathogens survive in bi oﬁlms, they504 Chapter 5could potentially cause disease in individuals with low-imm unity or com-
promised immune systems. Factors related to increased survival  of bac-
teria in chlorinated water include attachment to surfaces, en capsulation,
aggregation, low-nutrient growth conditions, and strain var iation.
Research has been conducted using the simulators to determine t he
effect of water quality changes on bioﬁlms in the distribution systems.
Results have indicated that bioﬁlms are resistant to disin fection regard-
less of the agent used. Other work has demonstrated that lowerin g system
pH can reduce bioﬁlm densities; however, such an effect is trans ient if
system pHs are returned to normal operating ranges (US EPA, 20 01). It
is reported that, recently, the Denver City Water developed an u ncommon
procedure—ozone disinfection of water mains for common ﬁeld operation. 
Cost of control. Chapter 14 (US EPA, 2001) discusses  the conditions
and causes of the formation of DBPs, and compares the various trea t-
ment techniques and associated costs for both controlling DBPs and
ensuring microbial safety. Making direct comparisons among the vari-
ous alternatives is difﬁcult. For example, moving the point-of-
disinfection (chlorination) would seem to be the lowest cost option. NF,
although the most expensive technology for precursor removal, has the
advantage of removing other contaminants such as total dissol ved solids
and various inorganics. Therefore, it might be used for achievin g other
treatment goals in addition to removing DBP precursors. For exam ple,
NF effectively removed microorganisms, thus serving as an altern ative
for chemical disinfection. Although the cost of enhanced coagulat ion
was not evaluated, it could be very effective if a utility is on ly slightly
out of compliance. However, in addition to increased coagulation c osts,
an additional cost may be associated with sludge handling . Clearly,
modifying the disinfection process is the lowest cost option for con trol-
ling DBPs, but as noted, there are by-products and problems a ssociated
with the use of some of the alternate disinfectants. For example, ch lo-
ramination is not as good a disinfectant as chlorine, and ozon e may
enhance regrowth of some organisms.
Retroﬁtting may be fairly easy with chloramination. For examp le, to
switch from chlorine to chloramines may only require the addit ion of
ammonia feed equipment. However, the use of ozone will require con-
struction of expensive ozone contactors. The use of chlorine dioxide wil l
probably require the use of a reducing agent such as ferrous ch loride,
which was not included in this costing analysis. The tech nologies dis-
cussed would normally be applied incrementally to a utility ’s existing
treatment. Therefore, the base cost associated with an assumed con ven-
tional treatment system and the incremental costs associated with vari-
ous DBP control alternatives have been summarized in Table 5.14  (US
EPA, 2001). Public Water Supply 505Regulations to control contaminants in drinking water in t he United
States are expected to become more and more stringent. Forthcoming
DBP regulations will affect virtually every community water s ystem in
the United States. There are various ways to control DBPs, one of w hich
is to use an alternative to chlorine to control halogenated by-pr oducts.
However, when this is done, one has to consider the consequences. The
unit processes considered are those that are effective for precursor
removal or for the use of alternate disinfectants. More efﬁcient treat -
ment will be required to meet future regulations. Also, water tr eatment
managers will have to become more knowledgeable about various trea t-
ment options that are cost-effective in order for them to meet present
and future regulations. Although essentially exempt in the pa st, small
water systems will be required to comply with future regulati ons. Singer
(2006) claimed that the ultimate solution to DBPs will be more expen-
sive and will necessitate the use of more aggressive management a nd
control strategies.
19 Water Fluoridation
Fluoride occurs naturally in water at low concentrations. Wa ter ﬂuori-
dation is the intentional addition of ﬂuoride to drinking wat er. During
the past 5 decades, water ﬂuoridation has been proven to be both  wise506 Chapter 5

SOURCE : US EPA, 2001and a most cost-effective method to prevent dental decay. The ratio of
beneﬁts (reductions in dental bills) to cost of water ﬂuoridation  is 50:1
(US Public Health Service, 1984). In order to prevent decay, the optimum
ﬂuoride concentration has been established at 1mg/L (American D ental
Association, 1980). The beneﬁts of ﬂuoridation last a lifetime. Wh ile it
is true that children reap the greatest beneﬁts from ﬂuoridati on, adults
beneﬁt also. Although there are beneﬁts, the opponents of water ﬂuor -
idation exist. The charges and the facts are discussed in th e manual (US
PHS, 1984).
Fluoride in drinking water is regulated under section 1412 of the Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA). In 1986, US EPA promulgated an  enforce-
able standard, a Maximum Contamination Level (MCL) of 4  mg/L for
ﬂuoride. This level is considered as protective of crippling skel etal ﬂu-
orosis, an adverse health effect. A review of human data led the EP A
(1990) to conclude that there was no evidence that ﬂuoride in wa ter pre-
sented a cancer risk in humans. A nonenforceable Secondary Maxi mum
Contamination Level (SMCL) of 2 mg/L was set to protect against obj ec-
tionable dental ﬂuorisis, a cosmetic effect.
19.1 Fluoride chemicals
Fluoride is a pale yellow noxious gaseous halogen. It is the thi rteenth
most abundant element in the earth’s crust and is not found in a free
state in nature. The three most commonly used ﬂuoride compounds i n
the water system are hydroﬂuosilicic acid (H2SiF6), sodium ﬂuoride
(NaF), and sodium silicoﬂuoride (Na2SiF6). Fluoride chemicals, like
chlorine, caustic soda, and many other chemicals used in w ater treat-
ment can cause a safety hazard. The operators should observe the s afe
handling of the chemical.
The three commonly used ﬂuoride chemicals have virtually 100 %
dissociation (Reeves, 1986, 1990):

water when present in high concentrations. It also reacts qu ickly with
water to form silicic acid and silica (SiO2):

Hydroﬂuosilicic acid has a dissociation very similar to sod ium silico-
ﬂuoride:
(5.193)
then it follows Eqs. (5.190), (5.191), and (5.192).
Hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) is very volatile and will attack glass and elec-
trical parts and will tend to evaporate in high concentrat ions.
19.2 Optimal ﬂuoride concentrations
The manual (Reeves, 1986) presents the recommended optimal ﬂuoride
levels for ﬂuoridated water supply systems based on the average and the
maximum daily air temperature in the area of the involved sch ool and
community. For community water system in the United States t he rec-
ommended ﬂuoride levels are from 0.7 mg/L in the south to 1.2 mg/ L to
the north of the country. The recommended ﬂuoride concentrations for
schools are from four to ﬁve times greater than that for communiti es.
The optimal ﬂuoride concentration can be calculated by the follow ing
equation:
F(mg/L) /H110050.34/ E (5.194)
where E is the estimated average daily water consumption for children
through age 10, in ounces of water per pound of body weight. The v alue
of E can be computed from
E /H110050.038 /H110010.0062 T (5.195)

Example 2: Calculate the dosage of ﬂuoride to the water plant in Example 1 ,
if the naturally occurring ﬂuoride concentration is 0.03 mg /L.
solution: The dosage can be obtained by subtracting the natural ﬂuorid e
level in water from the desired concentration:
Dosage /H110050.82 mg/L /H110020.03 mg/L /H110050.79 mg/L
As for other chemicals used in water treatment, the ﬂuoride chem icals are
not 100% pure. The purity of a chemical is available from the m anufactur-
ers. The information on the molecular weight, purity ( p), and the available
ﬂuoride ion (AFI) concentration for the three commonly used ﬂuoride ch em-
icals are listed in Table 5.15. The AFI is determined by the weight of ﬂuoride
portion divided by the molecular weight.

In practice 40 g of sodium ﬂuoride will dissolve in 1 L of wat er. It gives
40,000 mg/L (4% solution) of NF. The AFI is 0.45. Thus the concent ra-
tion of ﬂuoride in the saturator is 18,000 mg/L (40,000 mg/L /H110030.45). The
sodium ﬂuoride feed rate can be calculated as

Human health risk is the probability that a given exposure or a series

guidelines of the US EPA. This section speciﬁcally covers asses sing
and managing risks, radionuclides, and the value of health  advisories
concerning drinking water.
20.1 Risk
Risk is the potential for realization of unwanted adverse consequen ces or
events. In general terms, human health risk is the probabil ity of injury,
disease, or death under a given chemical or biological exposure or under
series of exposures. Risk may be expressed in quantitative term (zero to
one). In many cases, it can only be described as, high, low,  or trivial.
We do not live in a risk-free world, but in a chemical world. There are
more than 65,000 chemicals produced, and they are increasin g in
number every year. Through use and abuse, many of those chemical
products will end up in our environment—water, air, and lan d. These
chemicals include organics and inorganics that are used i n industries
(including water treatment plants), pharmaceuticals, agri cultures
(insecticides), home, personal cosmic purposes, etc. Even terroris m may
threaten our drinking water with chemical contamination.
Certain areas on the earth’s crest and rocks contain high l evels of some
naturally occurring chemical elements, such as lead, mercu ry, ﬂuoride,
and sulfur. In addition, radionuclides such as natural radium, Ra226,
Ra228; radon, Rn; uranium, U, etc.; and man-made radioactive s ub-
stances occur throughout the world. Many contaminants may end up in
source waters. Trace amounts of these contaminants might be pr esent
in the drinking water.
All human activities involve some degree of risk. Table 5.16 l ists the
risks of some common activities. In addition, pathogen contami nation in
food and drinking liquids poses risks. Waterborne disease outb reaks
(Giardia, Cryptosporidium, acute gastroenteritis , E. Coli, etc.) have
occurred in the past and can threaten at anytime (Hass, 200 2; Lin, 2002).
Sand ﬁltration, disinfection, and application of drinking water stan-
dards reduce waterborne diseases to protect public health. It was dis-
covered that DBPs result from the reaction of chlorine with natur al
organic matter (NOM) in source water. The risk of carcinogenic D BPs
is a dilemma for water utilities. Alternative treatment measu res and
microbial control have to be properly managed (see Section 19). 
The term “safe,” in its common usage, means “without risk.” I n tech-
nical terms, however, this common usage is misleading becaus e science
cannot ascertain the conditions under which a given chemica l exposure
is likely to be absolutely without a risk of any type.
Human health risk is the likelihood (or probability) that a g iven chem-
ical exposure or series of exposures may damage the health of exposed
individuals. Chemical risk assessment involves the complex analysis of514 Chapter 5exposures that have taken place in the past, the adverse healt h effects
of which may or may not have already occurred. It also involv es predic-
tion of the likely consequences of exposures that have not yet occurr ed. 
20.2 Risk assessment
Risk assessment is a quantitative evaluation process of healt h or/and
environmental risks determining the potential risks associat ed with
exposure to a type of human hazard—physical, chemical, or biolog ical.
There are four components to every (complete) risk assessment (US EPA,
1986):
1. Hazard identiﬁcation:
■Review and analyze toxic data (animal and human studies, a nd
negative epidemiological studies).
■Weigh the evidence that a substance causes various toxic effects .
■Evaluate whether toxic effects in one setting will occur in other
settings.
2. Dose-response evaluation:
■Perform an estimate of the quantitative relationship between the
amount of exposure to a hazardous identiﬁed substance and the
extent of toxic injury or disease.
■Extrapolate from high dose to low dose.
■Extrapolate test animals to humans.Public Water Supply 515

SOURCE : US EPA, 1986; R. Begole, State Farm Insurance, personal commun ication3. Human exposure evaluation:
■Investigate the inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact of a  toxic
chemical.
■Conduct case studies: how many people are exposed and through
which routes; what is the magnitude, duration, and time of exposure.
■Perform epidemiological studies within different geographic areas.
4. Risk characterization:
■Integrate the data and analyses of the above three evaluations t o esti-
mate potential carcinogenic risk and noncarcinogenic health effects.
Example: In most public health evaluations, it is assumed that an  individ-
ual adult or child consumes 2 or 1 L of water, respectively, ea ch day through
all uses. The average body weights for a men, women, and childr en are
assumed to be 70 kg (154 lb), 50 kg (110 lb), and 10 kg (22  lb), respectively.
A toxic substance is present at 0.7 mg/L in water. Determine the daily dose
of the three groups for toxicological purposes.
solution:
Step 1. Calculate daily intake (DI) of toxic substance
For an adult
DI/H110050.7 mg/L /H110032 L/d
/H110051.4 mg/d
For a child 
DI/H110050.7 mg/L /H110031 L/d
/H110050.7 mg/d
Step 2. Compute daily dose (DD) per unit weight
For a man
DD /H11005(1.4 mg/d)/70 kg
/H110050.02 mg/kg ⋅d
For a woman
DD /H11005(1.4 mg/d)/50 kg
/H110050.028 mg/kg ⋅d
For a child
DD /H11005(0.7 mg/d)/10 kg
/H110050.07 mg/kg ⋅d
Note : A child gets the highest dose.516 Chapter 5Dose-response models. The dose-response models for cancer death esti-
mation have been summarized (IUPAC, 1933; Klaassen, 2001). Th e
most frequently used ones are one-hit, Weibull, and multistage m odels
shown as follows:
One-hit (one-stage) model. The one-hit mechanistic model is based on the
somatic mutation theory in which only one hit of some minimum criti-
cal amount of a carcinogen at a cellular target for critical  cellular inter-
action is required for a cell to be altered (become cancerous). The
probability statement for this model is
P(d) /H110051 /H11002exp( /H11002bd) (5.202)
where P(d) /H11005the probability of cancer death from a continuous dose
rate, unitless
b/H11005constant
d/H11005dose rate, /H9262g/L
bd/H11005the number of hits occurring during a minute
Weibull model. The Weibull model is expressed as
P(d) /H110051 /H11002 exp( /H11002 bdk) (5.203)
where k/H11005critical number of hits for the toxic cellular response
Others are the same as the above.
Multistage model. Armitage and Doll (1957) developed a multistage model
for carcinogenesis that was based on these equations and on the hypoth-
esis that a series of ordered stages was required before a cell coul d undergo
mutation, initiation, transformation, and progression to form a tumor.
This relationship was generalized by Crump (1980) by maximizi ng the like-
lihood function over polynomials so that the probability statem ent is
P(d) /H110051 /H11002exp( /H11002(b0/H11001b1d1/H11001b2d2/H11001........./H11001bndk)) (5.204)
where P(d) /H11005the probability of cancer death from a continuous dose
rate, unitless
b’s /H11005constants, (mg/kg ⋅d)–1
k/H11005the number of dose groups (biological stages)
d/H11005dose rate, /H9262g/L
If the true value of b1is replaced with b1* (the upper conﬁdence limit
of b1), then a linearized multistage model can be derived where the ex pres-
sion is dominated by ( bd*)dat low doses. The slope on this conﬁdencePublic Water Supply 517interval, q1*, is used by US EPA for quantitative cancer assessment. To
obtain an upper 95% conﬁdence interval on risk, the q1* value (risk/ /H9004
dose in (mg/kg ⋅d)/H110021) is multiplied by the amount of exposure (mg/kg ⋅d).
Thus, the upper-bound estimate on risk Ris calculated as
R/H11005q1* (mg/kg ⋅d)/H110021 /H11003exposure (mg/kg ⋅d) (5.205)
This relationship has been used to calculate a “virtually s afe dose”
(VSD), which represents the lower 95% conﬁdence limit on a dose th at
gives an “acceptable level” of risk (e.g. upper conﬁdence limit for 10/H110026
excess risk). The integrated risk information system (IRIS) develop ed
by the US EPA gives q* values for many environmental carcinogens
(US EPA, 2000a). Because both the q1* and VSD values are calculated
using 95% conﬁdence intervals, the values are believed to represen t
conservative, protective estimates.
The US EPA has utilized the linearized multistage model to calcu late
“unit risk estimates” in which the upper conﬁdence limit on  increased
individual lifetime risk of cancer for 70-kg human, breathing  1 /H9262g/m3of
contaminated air or drinking 2 L/d of water containing 1 pp m (1 mg/L),
is estimated over a 70-year life span.
The human equivalent dosages are derived by multiplying the c orre-
sponding animal dosages by ( Wh/Wa)1/3. Where Whand Waare average
body weight of men and test animals, respectively.
When the response and human equivalent dose data are ﬁt to the l in-
earized multistage model, the 95% upper limit on the largest li near
term is q1*. Then,
q1* /H11005q1a* (Wh/Wa)1/3
To estimate the 95% lower level of dose concentration, d, corresponding
to a 95% conﬁdence level of risk R, 
R/H110051 /H11002 exp(– dq1*) (5.206)

then d(in mg/kg ⋅d) /H11005(1/q1*) /H11003ln(1 /H11002 R) (5.207)
To solve for din /H9262g/L with a 70-kg man drinking 2 L/d of water, a factor
is applied.

ride in the diet is 2.3 (mg/kg ⋅d)/H110021. Determine the corresponding lowest con-

Radionuclides in drinking water. Radionuclides may occur naturally
and may be man-made (about 200% in number more than natural
ones). Natural radionuclides in drinking water supplies in clude
radium (Ra-226 and Ra-228), radon (Rn-222), uranium (U-238), l ead
(Pb-210), polonium (Po-210), and thorium (Th-230 and Th-232). They
omit one or more of the three types of nuclear radiation, i.e. alpha ,
beta, and gamma rays in air, food, and drinking water. Th e radiation
attacks bone, red bone marrow, gonads, breast, kidney, lung,  skin
(burn), etc. Most radionuclides have long decay half-lives. For ex am-
ple, the half-lives for U-238 and Ra-228 are respectively of 4.5 /H11003109
and 6.7 years. The radioactivity is expressed in curies (Ci).  One curie
is the number of particles per second from one gram of radium. Dos e
is the energy of a particle. One rad of dose is 100 ergs per gra m of
energy deposited.
The MCLGs for radionuclides are set as zero. The MCLs for gross
alpha particle activity, combined with Ra-226 and Ra-228 , and man-
made (approximately 200) radionuclides are 15 pCi/L, 5 pCi/L,  and 
4 millirem/yr. respectively. One pCi (pico Curie) is 10/H1100212Ci. 
The drinking water equivalent level (DWEL, in pCi/L) for radionu-
clides is deﬁned as (US EPA, 1986)

solution: Usually, BW /H1100570 kg and WC /H110052 L/d are used for assessing risks.
Using Eq. (5.209)
20.3 Risk management
Risk management is deﬁned as decisions about whether an asses sed risk
is sufﬁciently high to present a public health concern and about the
appropriate methods for control of a risk judged to be signiﬁcan t. In other
words, it is the process of deciding what to do about the probl ems.
Risk management involves the following:
■ﬁnd and decide the problems from risk assessment (type and conc en-
tration of contaminants),
■assume knowledge of health risks,
■factor in the hydrology feasibility study and capital and operating
(site-speciﬁc) cost analyses,
■decide and evaluate the measures (alternative control strategies) for
solving the problems,
■reexamine exposure issues previously dealt with in risk assess -
ment, and
■evaluate and monitor the results for the corrective measures for
meeting drinking water standards control strategies. 
The basic categories of alternative control strategies may inclu de source
control, treatment, combination of the above two, and short-term s trate-
gies. The short-term control strategies are the use of bottled water,  point-
of-use treatment (RO or ion exchange), or issuance of a boil water ord er.
The disadvantages of point-of-use units (in-home and workplace water
treatment) are maintenance upkeep problems and higher cost. 570 /H9262g/L 50.07 mg/L31000 /H9262g/mg 5s1 mg/kg #dds0.01ds70 kgd

In foreign countries and even in the United States, some are bott led from
the tap water (public drinking water systems).
Several best management practices for performing in the watershed
may be used for controlling raw water source to reduce or elimina te con-
taminants. Water supply utilities may locate new sources of supply. If
so, the new sources can be blended with or replace the existing water
source. Interceptor well(s) upstream of the source water may be used  to
protect water supply wells. The wastewaters from the interceptor wells
need proper disposal or treatment.
If the contaminant source is a leaking storage tank, ﬁx or r emove the
tank; pump the well until contaminant levels drop, and th en treat the
contaminated soil.
Treatment strategies. Treatment involves best available treatment tech-
niques to reduce contaminant to meet MCLs. Conventional treatment
processes combined with additional techniques can reduce conta minant
levels (Table 5.16; see US EPA, 1986):

The speciﬁc processes can be added to the existing treatment
processes. An excellent overview and case studies, including c apital and
operating costs of the above processes used for risk management and
health advisories, are presented in the US EPA (1986).
Example 1: Based on lack of signiﬁcant decrease in cholinesterase activit y
in rats, the NOAEL for aldicarb sulfoxide in rats is 0.125  mg/kg ⋅d. For HA
calculation purpose, EPA assumes: 
Body weight, BW /H1100570 kg for a man
BW /H1100510 kg for a child
Daily water consumed, WC /H110052 L/d for man
WC /H110051 L/d for 10-kg child
Uncertainty factor, UF /H11005100 for use with animal NOAEL
This example illustrates how the US EPA determines the HA numbers  for
pesticide aldicarb.
solution:
Step 1. Calculate 1-day health advisory (HA)
For the 10-kg child: Using Eq. (5.13)
Step 2. Determine 10-day health advisory
Since aldicarb is metabolized and excreted rapidly (>90% in ur ine alone
in a 24-h period following a single dose), the 1- and 10-day HA va lues would 50.012 mg/L or 12 /H9262g/L 5s0.125 mg/kg #dd s10 kgd

same as the 1-day HA (12 /H9262g/L).
Step 3. Longer-term health advisory
For the 10-kg child:
Step 4. Determine lifetime health advisory
a. Calculate RfD using Eq. (5.13a)
*RRfD /H11005risk reference dose: estimate of daily exposure to the human
population that appears to be without appreciable risk of delet erious
noncarcinogenic effects over a lifetime of exposure. 
The lifetime health advisory proposed above reﬂects the assumption
that 100 % of the exposure to aldicarb residues is via drinki ng water.
Since aldicarb is used on food crops, the potential exists for d ietary
exposure also, lacking compound-speciﬁc data on actual relati ve source
contribution; it may be assumed that drinking water contr ibutes 20%
of an adult’s daily exposure to aldicarb. The lifetime health a dvisory for
the 70-kg adult would be 9 /H9262g/L, taking this relative source contribu-
tion into account. 
Example 2: There are no suitable data available to estimate 1-day, 10-day,
and long-term health advisories. The study of the subacute exposu re 
to trichloroethylene (TTC) via inhalation 5 days a week for 14 weeks  
by adult rats identiﬁed a LOAEL 55 ppm (300 mg/m3). Derive the DWEL

The estimated excess cancer risk associated with lifetime exposur e to
drinking water containing trichloroethylene at 260 /H9262g/L is approxi-
mately 1 /H1100310/H110024. This estimate represents the upper 90% conﬁdence
limit from extrapolations prepared by EPA’s Carcinogen Assess ment
Group using the linearized multistage model. The actual risk is unlikely
to exceed this value, but there is considerable uncertainty as  to the
accuracy of risk calculated by using this methodology.
Example 3: A subchronic toxicity study of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM)
dissolved in soybean oil was administrated 6 days a week for 13 weeks, by
average to male and female wister rats. The NOAEL in the study was iden-
tiﬁed as 30 mg/kg ⋅d. 
Estimate the values of HA for VCM.
solution:
Step 1. Estimate 1-day HA
There are insufﬁcient data for estimation of a 1-day HA. The 10-day HA is
proposed as a conservative estimate for a 1-day HA.DWEL5s0.00735 mg/kg #dds70 kgd
L/d50.26 mg/L   s260 /H9262g/LdRfd5s7.35 mg/kg #dd
s100ds10d50.00735 mg/kg #d524 Chapter 5Step 2. Determine 10-day HA (as well as 1-day HA)
For a 10-kg child:
where 6/7 /H11005expansion of 6 d/week treatment in the study 
to 7 d/week to represent daily exposure
Others /H11005as previous examples
Note : This HA is equivalent to 2.6 mg/d or 0.26 mg/kg ⋅d.
Step 3. Determine the longer-term HA
Using Eq. (5.13),
for a child
for an adult
Note : This HA is equivalent to 92 /H9262g/d or 1.3 /H9262g/kg ⋅d.
Step 4. Determine the lifetime HA
Because vinyl chloride is classiﬁed as a human carcinogen (Group A of US
EPA, Group 1 of International Agency for Research on Cancer), a lifetime HA
is not recommended.

“Wastewater,” also known as “sewage,” originates from household
wastes, human and animal wastes, industrial wastewaters , storm
runoff, and groundwater infiltration. Wastewater, basically,  is the flow
of used water from a community. It is 99.94% water by weight (Water
Pollution Control Federation, 1980). The remaining 0.06% is materi al
dissolved or suspended in the water. It is largely the water supply of a
community after it has been fouled by various uses.
2 Characteristics of Wastewater
An understanding of physical, chemical, and biological ch aracteristics
of wastewater is very important in design, operation, and man agement
of collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewater. The nature of waste-
water includes physical, chemical, and biological charac teristics which
depend on the water usage in the community, the industrial a nd com-
mercial contributions, weather, and infiltration/inflow.
2.1 Physical properties of wastewater
When fresh, wastewater is gray in color and has a musty and  not unpleas-
ant odor. The color gradually changes with time from gray to b lack. Foul
and unpleasant odors may then develop as a result of septic sew age.
The most important physical characteristics of wastewater ar e its tem-
perature and its solids concentration.
Temperature and solids content in wastewater are very importan t
factors for wastewater treatment processes. Temperature affects chem-
ical reaction and biological activities. Solids, such as total suspended
solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), and settleable soli ds, affect
the operation and sizing of treatment units.
Solids. Solids comprise matter suspended or dissolved in water and
wastewater. Solids are divided into several different fractions a nd their
concentrations provide useful information for characterization of wa ste-
water and control of treatment processes.Wastewater Engineering 533

References 884Total solids. Total solids (TS) is the sum of total suspended solids and
total dissolved solids (TDS). Each of these groups can be further divided
into volatile and fixed fractions. Total solids is the materia l left in the
evaporation dish after it has dried for at least 1h or overnigh t (prefer-
ably) in an oven at 103 to 105 /H11034C and is calculated according to Standard
Methods (APHA et al., 1995)

Total suspended solids. Total suspended solids (TSS) are referred to as
nonfilterable residue. The TSS is a very important quality par ameter
for water and wastewater and is a wastewater treatment effluent stan-
dard. The TSS standards for primary and secondary effluents ar e usu-
ally set at 30 and 12 mg/L, respectively. TSS is determined by filtering
a well-mixed sample through a 0.2 mm pore size, 24 mm diameter mem-
brane; the membrane filter is placed in a Gooch crucible, and  the residue
retained on the filter is dried in an oven for at least 1h at a  constant
weight at 103 to 105 °C. It is calculated as

Total dissolved solids. Dissolved solids are also called filterable residues.
Total dissolved solids in raw wastewater are in the range of 2 50 to
850 m g/L.
TDS is determined as follows. A well-mixed sample is filtered throu gh
a standard glass fiber filter of 2.0 mm normal pore size, and the filtrate
is evaporated for at least 1h in an oven at 180 /H110062/H11034C. The increase in
dish weight represents the total dissolved solids, which is calculated as

Fixed and volatile solids. The residue from TS, TSS, or TDS tests is
ignited to constant weight at 550 /H11034C. The weight lost on ignition is called
volatile solids, whereas the remaining solids represent the fixed  total,
suspended, or dissolved solids. The portions of volatile and fixed solids
are computed by

The determination of the volatile portion of solids is useful in cont rol-
ling wastewater treatment plant operations because it gives a  rough esti-
mation of the amount of organic matter present in the solid fract ion of
wastewater, activated sludge, and in industrial waste.
Determination of volatile and fixed solids does not distinguish pre-
cisely between organic and inorganic matter. Because the loss on igni-
tion is not confined only to organic matter, it includes losses  due to
decomposition or volatilization of some mineral salts. The determina -
tion of organic matter can be made by tests for biochemical oxyg en
demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total organic
carbon (TOC).
Settleable solids. Settleable solids is the term applied to material set-
tling out of suspension within a defined time. It may includ e floating
material, depending on the technique. Settled solids may be exp ressed
on either a volume (mL/L) or a weight (mg/L) basis.
The volumetric method for determining settleable solids is as follow s.
Fill an Imhoff cone to the 1-L mark with a well-mixed sample. Sett le for
45 min, gently agitate the sample near the sides of the Imhoff c one with
a rod or by spinning, then continue to settle for an additiona l 15 min and
record the volume of settleable solids in the cones as mL/L.
Another test to determine settleable solids is the gravimetric
method. First, determine total suspended solids as stated above.
Second, determine nonsettleable suspended solids from the super-
natant of the same sample which has settled for 1 h. Then determ ine
TSS (mg/L) of this supernatant liquor; this gives the nonsettlea ble
solids. The settleable solids can be calculated as

ses. Weights (wt.) of evaporating dish with and without the s ample either

2.2 Chemical constituents of wastewater
The dissolved and suspended solids in wastewater contain organ ic and
inorganic material. Organic matter may include carbohydr ates, fats,
oils, grease, surfactants, proteins, pesticides and other agr icultural
chemicals, volatile organic compounds, and other toxic chemic als (house-
hold and industrial). Inorganics may include heavy metals , nutrients
(nitrogen and phosphorus), pH, alkalinity, chlorides, sulfur,  and other
inorganic pollutants. Gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrog en, oxygen,
hydrogen sulfide, and methane may be present in a wastewater.
Normal ranges of nitrogen levels in domestic raw wastewater are
25 to 85 mg/L for total nitrogen (the sum of ammonia, nitrate, n itrite,
and organic nitrogen); 12 to 50 mg/L ammonia nitrogen; and 8  to
35 mg/L organic nitrogen (WEF 1996a). The organic nitrogen con-
centration is determined by a total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) ana lysis,
which measures the sum of organic and ammonia nitrogen. Orga nic
nitrogen is then calculated by subtracting ammonia nitrog en from
the TKN measurement.
Typical total phosphorus concentrations of raw wastewater ran ge
from 2 to 20 mg/L, which includes 1 to 5 mg/L of organic phosp horus and
1 to 15 mg/L of inorganic phosphorus (WEF 1996a). Both nitrogen a nd
phosphorus in wastewater serve as essential elements for biologica l
growth and reproduction during wastewater treatment processes and
in the natural water.Wastewater Engineering 537The strength (organic content) of a wastewater is usually measur ed as
5-days biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand,
and total organic carbon. The BOD5test measures the amount of oxygen
required to oxidize the organic matter in the sample during 5 days of bio-
logical stabilization at 20 °C. This is usually referred to as the first stage
of carbonaceous BOD (CBOD), not nitrification (second phase). Second ary
wastewater treatment plants are typically designed to remove C BOD, not
for nitrogenous BOD (except for advanced treatment). The BOD5of raw
domestic wastewater in the United States is normally between 1 00 and
250 mg/L. It is higher in other countries. In this chapter , the term BOD5
represents 5-days BOD, unless stated otherwise.
The ratio of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in wastewater is very
important for biological treatment processes, where there is norma lly
a surplus of nutrients. The commonly accepted BOD/N/P weight r atio
for biological treatment is 100/5/1; i.e. 100 mg/L BOD to 5 mg/L nitro-
gen to 1 mg/L phosphorus. The ratios for raw sanitary wastewat er and
settled (primary) effluent are 100/17/5 and 100/23/7, respecti vely.
Example 1: Calculate the pounds of BOD5and TSS produced per capita per
day. Assume average domestic wastewater flow is 100 gallons (3 78 L) per
capita per day (gpcpd), containing BOD5and TSS concentrations in waste-
water of 200 and 240 mg/L, respectively.

/H11005 0.20 lb/(c /H11080d)
/H11005 90 g/(c /H11080d)
Note : 100 gal/(c /H11080d) of flow and 0.17 lb BOD5per capita per day are commonly
used for calculation of the population equivalent of hydraulic a nd BOD load-
ings for other wastewaters.
In newly developed communities, generally designed wastewater flow  is
120 gpcpd. With the same concentrations, the loading rate for  design purpose
would be
BOD /H11005 0.20 lb/(c /H11080d)

Chemical oxygen demand. Concept and measurement of BOD are fully
covered in Chapter 1. Since the BOD5test is time consuming, chemical
oxygen demand is routinely performed for wastewater treatment opera-
tions after the relationship between BOD5and COD has been developed
for a wastewater treatment plant. Many regulatory agencies ac cept the
COD test as a tool of the wastewater treatment operation. The total 512,300 personsHydraulic E.P. 54656 m3/d31000 L/m3

wastewater.
The chemical oxygen demand is a measurement of the oxygen equiv-
alent of the organic matter content of a sample that is suscept ible to oxi-
dation by a strong chemical oxidant, such as potassium d ichromate.
For a sample, COD can be related empirically to BOD, organic  carbon,
or organic matter.
After the correlation of BOD5and COD has been established, the
COD test is useful for controlling and monitoring wastewater t reat-
ment processes. The COD test takes 3 to 4 h rather than 5 day s for BOD
data. The COD results are typically higher than the BOD v alues. The
correlation between COD and BOD varies from plant to plant. Th e BOD:
COD ratio also varies across the plant from influent to process  units to
effluent. The ratio is typically 0.5:1 for raw wastewater and may drop
to as low as 0.1:1 for well-stabilized secondary effluent. The norma l
COD range for raw wastewater is 200 to 600 mg/L (WEF 1996a).
COD test. Most types of organic matter in water or wastewater are oxi-
dized by a boiling mixture of sulfuric and chromic acids wi th excess of
potassium dichromate (K2Cr207). After 2-h refluxing, the remaining
unreduced K2Cr207is titrated with ferrous ammonium sulfate to meas-
ure the amount of K2Cr207consumed and the oxidizable organic matter
is calculated in terms of oxygen equivalent. The COD test can be per-
formed by either the open reflux or the closed reflux method. The open
reflux method is suitable for a wide range of wastewaters, whereas  the
closed reflux method is more economical but requires homogenization
of samples containing suspended solids to obtain reproducible r esults.
The COD test procedures (open reflux) are (APHA et al., 1998):
■Place appropriate size of sample in a 500-mL refluxing flask use
50 mL if COD /H11021 900 mg/L
use less sample and dilute to 50 mL if COD /H11022900 mg/L
use large size of sample if COD /H1102150 mL
■Add 1 g of HgSO4and several glass beads
■Slowly add 5 mL sulfuric acid reagent and mix to dissolve Hg SO4
■Cool the mixture
■Add 25.0 mL of 0.0417 mole K2Cr207solution and mix
■Attach the refluxing flask to condenser and turn on cooling wa ter
■Add 70 mL sulfuric acid reagent through open end of condenser, t hen
swirl and mix
■Cover open end of condenser with a small beaker
■Reflux for 2 h (usually 1 blank with several samples)540 Chapter 6■Cool and wash down condenser with distilled water to about tw ice

2.3 Biological characteristics 
of wastewater
The principal groups of microorganisms found in wastewater are bac-
teria, fungi, protozoa, microscopic plants and animals, and  viruses. Most
microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa) are responsible and are benefici al
for biological treatment processes of wastewater. However, some path-
ogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses found in wastewat er are of
public concern.
Indicator bac teria. Pathogenic organisms are usually excreted by
humans from the gastrointestinal tract and discharge to wa stewater.
Water-borne diseases include cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid fever, 5451 5s24.53212.88d30.24238000/50COD as mg O 2/L5sA2Bd3M38000
mL sampleCOD as mg O 2/L5sA2Bd3M38000
mL sampleWastewater Engineering 541diarrhea, and dysentery. The number of pathogenic organisms in  waste-
waters is generally low in density and they are difficult to isolate and
identify. Therefore, indicator bacteria such as total coliform (TC),  fecal
coliform (FC), and fecal streptococcus (FS) are used as indicator org an-
isms. The concept of indicator bacteria and enumeration of bacter ial den-
sity are discussed in Chapter 1.
Tests for enumeration of TC, FC, and FS can be performed by multipl e-
tube fermentation (most probable number, MPN) or membrane filter
methods; the test media used are different for these three groups of
indicators. Most regulatory agencies have adopted fecal coliform density
as an effluent standard because FC is mostly from fecal material .
3 Sewer Systems
Sewers are underground conduits to convey wastewater and storm-
water to a treatment plant or to carry stormwater to the point  of dis-
posal. Sewers can be classified into three categories: sanitary , storm, and
combined. Community sewer systems, according to their discha rging
types, can be divided into separated and combined sewer system s.
3.1 Separated sewer system
Separated sewers consist of sanitary sewers and stormwater sewer
networks separately. Sanitary sewers carry a mixture of househ old and
commercial sewage, industrial wastewater, water from groundwa ter
infiltration/inflow, basement and foundation drainage connection s, and
cross-connections between sanitary sewers and stormwater draina ge.
Separated sanitary sewers should be free of stormwater, but they
seldom are.
Storm sewers are commonly buried pipes that convey storm drain age.
They may include open channel elements and culverts, particul arly
when drainage areas are large.
Storm sewer networks convey mainly surface storm runoff from roofs,
streets, parking lots, and other surfaces toward the nearest r eceiving
water body. An urban drainage system with separated sewers is more
expensive than a combined sewer system because it uses two para llel
conduits. Sanitary and storm sewers are usually designed t o operate
under gravity flow conditions. Pressure or vacuum sewers are ra re.
Storm sewers are dry much of the time. When rainfalls are gentle,  the
surface runoffs are usually clear and low flows present no serious  prob-
lem. However, flooding runoffs wash and erode unprotected areas and
create siltation.
Illicit connections from roofs, yards, and foundations drain fl ow to
sanitary sewers through manhole covers that are not tight. Th e flow542 Chapter 6rates vary and are as high as 70 gal/(c /H11080d) and average 30 gal/(c /H11080d). A
rainfall of 1 in (2.54 cm)/ h on 1200 ft2(111 m2) of roof produces a flow of
12.5 gal/min (0.788 L/s) or 18,000 gal/d. Spreading over a n acre (0.4047 ha),
1 in/h equals 1.008 ft3/s (28.5 L/s) of runoff. Leakage through manhole
covers can add 20 to 70 gal/min (1.26 to 4.42 L/s) to the sew er when
there is as much as 1 in of water on the streets (Fair et al., 1966).
Example: A house has a roof of 30 ft by 40 ft (9.14 m /H1100312.19 m) and is occu-
pied by four people. What is the percentage of rainfall of 1 in/h, using a rate
of leakage through manholes of 60 gal/(c /H11080d)?

3.2 Combined sewers
Combined sewers are designed for collection and conveyance of both
sanitary sewage, including industrial wastewaters, and storm surface
runoff in one conduit. Combined sewer systems are common in old US
and European urban communities. In the United States, there has been
a trend to replace combined sewers by separate sewer systems. The
dry-weather flow (sanitary and industrial wastewaters, plus  street
drainage from washing operations and lawn sprinkling and infiltra-
tion) is intercepted to the treatment facility. During storm ev ents, when
the combined wastewater and stormwater exceed the capacity of th e
treatment plant, the overflow is bypassed directly to the receiv ing water
body without treatment or is stored for future treatment. The overflow
is the so-called combined sewer overflow (CSO).
The average BOD5in stormwater is approximately 30 mg/L. The aver-
age BOD5in combined sewer overflows is between 60 and 120 mg/L
(Novotny and Chesters, 1981). Since the CSO bypass may resul t in sig-
nificant pollution, even during high river flows, it will c reate a hazardous
threat to downstream water users. Thus, proper management of CSO  is
required (e.g. storage and later treatment). One obvious solution is to
replace combined sewers by separate sewers; however, costs and leg ali-
ties of shifting are major concerns.Wastewater Engineering 543Example: The following information is given:

The quantity of wastewater produced varies in different communiti es
and countries, depending on a number of factors such as water uses,
climate, lifestyle, economics, etc. Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. (19 91) lists typ-
ical municipal water uses and wastewater flow rates in the United
States including domestic, commercial, institutional, and  recreational
facilities and various institutions.
A typical wastewater flow rate from a residential home in the Un ited
States might average 70 gal (265 L) per capita per day (gal/ (c /H11080d) or gpcpd).
Approximately 60% to 85% of the per capita consumption of water b ecomes
wastewater. Commonly used quantities of wastewater flow rates th at form
miscellaneous types of facilities are listed in Table 6.1 (Illi nois EPA, 1997).
Municipal wastewater is derived largely from the water suppl y. Some
water uses, such as for street washing, lawn watering, fire fighting,
and leakage from water supply pipelines, most likely do not rea ch the
sewers. The volume of wastewater is added to by infiltration and inflows.
Wastewater flow rates for commercial developments normally range
from 800 to 1500 gal/(acre /H11080d) (7.5 to 14 m3/(ha /H11080d)), while those for indus-
tries are 1000 to 1500 gal/(acre /H11080d) (9.4 to 14 m3/(ha /H11080d)) for light indus-
trial developments and 1500 to 3000 gal/(acre /H11080d) (14 to 28 m3/(ha /H11080d))
for medium industrial developments.
Water entering a sewer system from ground through defective con-
nections, pipes, pipe joints, or manhole wells is called infil tration. The
amount of flow into a sewer from groundwater, infiltration, may r ange
from 100 to 10,000 gal/(d /H11080in /H11080mile) (0.093 to 9.26 m3/(d /H11080cm /H11080km)) or
more (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991). Construction specification s com-
monly permit a maximum infiltration rate of 500 gal/(d /H11080in /H11080mile)
(0.463 m3/(d /H11080cm /H11080km)) of pipe diameter. The quantity of infiltration may
be equal to 3 to 5% of the peak hourly domestic wastewater flow, or
approximately 10% of the average daily flow. With better pipe joi nt
material and tight control of construction methods, infiltrat ion allowance
can be as low as 200 gal/(d /H11080mile /H11080in) of pipe diameter (Hammer, 1986).
Inflow to a sewer includes steady inflow and direct inflow. Stea dy
inflow is water drained from springs and swampy areas, dis charged
from foundation, cellar drains, and cooling facilities, etc. D irect inflow
is from stormwater runoff direct to the sanitary sewer.

4.1 Design ﬂow rates
The average daily flow (volume per unit time), maximum daily flow , peak
hourly flow, minimum hourly and daily flows, and design pea k flow are
generally used as the basis of design for sewers, lift stations,  sewage(wastewater) treatment plants, treatment units, and other was tewater
handling facilities. Definitions and purposes of flow are given as follows.
The design average flow is the average of the daily volumes to be
received for a continuous 12-month period of the design year. The aver -
age flow may be used to estimate pumping and chemical costs, sludge
generation, and organic-loading rates.
The maximum daily flow is the largest volume of flow to be received
during a continuous 24-hour period. It is employed in the cal culation of
retention time for equalization basin and chlorine contact time.
The peak hourly flow is the largest volume received during a 1h
period, based on annual data. It is used for the design of coll ection and
interceptor sewers, wet wells, wastewater pumping stations, w aste-
water flow measurements, grit chambers, settling basins, ch lorine con-
tact tanks, and pipings. The design peak flow is the insta ntaneous
maximum flow rate to be received. The peak hourly flow is commonly
assumed as three times the average daily flow.
The minimum daily flow is the smallest volume of flow received dur ing
a 24-h period. The minimum daily flow is important in the si zing of con-
duits where solids might be deposited at low flow rates.
The minimum hourly flow is the smallest hourly flow rate occurr ing
over a 24-h period, based on annual data. It is important t o the sizing
of wastewater flowmeters, chemical-feed systems, and pumping syst ems.
Example: Estimate the average and maximum hourly flow for a community
of 10,000 persons.
Step 1. Estimate wastewater daily flow rate
Assume average water consumption /H11005 200 L/(c /H11080 d)
Assume 80% of water consumption goes to the sewer
Average wastewater flow /H11005 200 L/(c /H11080d) /H110030.80 /H1100310,000 persons

Step 2. Compute average hourly flow rate
Average hourly flow rate /H11005 1600 m3/d /H110031 d/24 h
/H11005 66.67 m3/h
Step 3. Estimate the maximum hourly flow rate
Assume the maximum hourly flow rate is three times the average hourly
flow rate, thus
Maximum hourly flow rate /H11005 66.67 m3/h /H110033
/H11005200 m3/h548 Chapter 65 Urban Stormwater Management
In the 1980s, stormwater detention or retention basin became one of the
most popular and widely used best management practices (BMPs) for
quality enhancement of stormwater. In the United States, Congr ess
mandated local governments to research ways to reduce the impac t of
separate storm sewer systems and CSO discharges on all receiv ing water
bodies. In Europe, most communities use combined sewer systems, with
some separate storm sewer systems in newer suburban communities . The
CSO problem has received considerable attention in Europe.
Both quality and quantity of stormwater should be considered when
protecting water quality and reducing property damage and traffic delay
by urban flooding. Stormwater detention is an important measu re for
both quality and quantity control. Temporarily storing or detaining
stormwater is a very effective method. Infiltration practices ar e the
most effective in removing stormwater pollutants (Livingston, 199 5).
When stormwater is retained long enough, its quality will be enhanced.
Several publications (US EPA 1974c, 1983a, (NIPC) 1992, WEF a nd
ASCE 1992, Wanielista and Yousef, 1993, Urbonas and Stah re, 1993,
Pitt and Voorhees, 1995, Shoemaker et al., 1995, Terstriep and Lee,
1995, Truong and Phua, 1995) describe stormwater management plans
and design guidelines for control (e.g. detention or storage facili ties) in
detail. Storage facilities include local disposal, inlet cont rol at source
(rooftops, parking lots, commercial or industrial yards, and  other sur-
faces), on-site detention (swales or ditches, dry basins or ponds,  wet
ponds, concrete basins, underground pipe packages or clusters ), in-line
detention (concrete basins, excess volume in the sewer system, pip e
packages, tunnels, underground caverns, surface ponds), off-line stor-
age (direct to storage), storage at treatment plant, and constr ucted
wetland.
Two of the largest projects for urban stormwater management are
given. Since the early 1950s, Toronto, Canada, has expanded with urban
development. The city is located at the lower end of a watershed. I n 1954,
Hurricane Hazel brought a heavy storm (6 in. in 1 hour). Subseq uently,
overflow from the Don River flooded the city. Huge damage and losses
occurred. Thereafter, an urban management commission was formed
and two large flood control reservoirs were constructed. Natural tech-
niques were applied to river basin management.
After Hurricane Hazel in 1954, the Government of Ontario created
“Conservation Authorities” to manage water quality in major drainage
basins in the province. Their initial focus was on flood control . It grad-
ually expanded to what we now call integrated watershed mana gement.
In the late 1960s, the Government of Canada initiated federal-pr ovincial
comprehensive river basin planning exercises in various basi ns across
the country. The results of these comprehensive river basin, or “a quaticWastewater Engineering 549ecosystem” planning exercises were mixed, but much was learned  about
technical matters, public participation, and combining technical, eco-
nomic, environmental, and social issues.
In Chicago, USA, before the 1930s combined sewers were built, a s in
other older municipalities. About 100 storms per year caused a combi-
nation of raw wastewater and stormwater to discharge into Chi cagoland
waterways. Approximately 500,000 homes had chronic flooding problems.
Based on the need for pollution and flood controls, the mass $3.66  billion
Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP) was formed. Also known as Chica go’s
Deep Tunnel, this project of intergovernmental efforts has undergone
more than 25 years of planning and construction. The two-phased  plan
was approved by the water district commissions in 1972. Ph ase 1 aimed
to control pollution and included 109 miles (175.4 km) of tunn els and
three dewatering pumping stations. Phase 2 was designed for flood  con-
trol and resulted in construction of three reservoirs with a tot al capacity
of 16 billion gal (60.6 billion L) (Carder, 1997).
The entire plan consisted of four separate systems—Mainstream,
Calumet, Des Plaines, and O’Hare. TARP has a total of 130 mil es (209 km)
of tunnels, 243 vertical drop shafts, 460 near-surface collecti ng struc-
tures, three pumping stations, and 126,000 acre /H11080ft (155,400,000 m3) of
storage in three reservoirs. The reservoir project began in the mid dle of
the 1990s (F. W. Dodge Profile, 1994; Kirk, 1997).
The tunnels were excavated through the dolomite rock strata, usi ng
tunnel boring machines. The rough, excavated diameter of the tun nel
is about 33 ft (10 m). Tunnel depths range from 150 to 360 ft (45.7 to
110 m) below the ground surface and their diameter ranges from 9  to
33 ft (2.7 to 10 m). The construction of the Mainstream tunnel s tarted
in 1976 and it went into service in 1985.
The TARP’s mainstream pumping station in Hodgkins, Illinois , is the
largest pumping station in the United States. It boasts s ix pumps: four
with a combined capacity of 710 Mgal/d (31.1 m3/s) and two with a com-
bined capacity of 316 Mgal/d (13.8 m3/s). The stored wastewater is
pumped to wastewater treatment plants. The TARP system received the
1986 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement award from the
American Society of Civil Engineers (Robison, 1986) and the 198 9
Outstanding Achievement in Water Pollution Control award from the
Water Pollution Control Federation (current name, Water Environment
Federation). It is now one of the important tour sites in Chicago.
5.1 Urban drainage systems
Urban drainage systems or storm drainage systems consist of flood
runoff paths, called the major system. Major (total) drainage s ystems
are physical facilities that collect, store, convey, and trea t runoff that550 Chapter 6exceeds the minor systems. It is composed of paths for runoff to flow to
a receiving stream. These facilities normally include detention and
retention facilities, street storm sewers, open channels, and sp ecial
structures such as inlets, manholes, and energy dissipator s (Metcalf
and Eddy, Inc. 1970; WEF and ASCE, 1992).
The minor or primary system is the portion of the total drainag e
system that collects, stores, and conveys frequently occurring  runoff, and
provides relief from nuisance and inconvenience. The minor system
includes streets, sewers, and open channels, either natural or  con-
structed. It has traditionally been carefully planned and constructed,
and usually represents the major portion of the urban drainag e infra-
structure investment. The major drainage system is usually less con-
trolled than the minor system and will function regardless of whether
or not it has been deliberately designed and/or protected agains t
encroachment, including when the minor system is blocked or ot herwise
inoperable (WEF and ASCE, 1992). The minor system is traditiona lly
planned and designed to safely convey runoff from storms with a s pe-
cific recurrence interval, usually 5 to 10 years (Novotny et al., 1989). In
the United States, flood drainage systems are included in flood insur-
ance studies required by the Office of Insurance and Hazard Miti gation
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
6 Design of Storm Drainage Systems
Urban drainage control facilities have progressed from crude dr ain
ditches to the present complex systems. The systems start from s urface
runoff management control facilities, such as vegetation covers, deten-
tion or storage facilities, sedimentation basin, filtration, t o curbs, gutters,
inlets, manholes, and underground conduits.
Managing surface runoff in urban areas is a complex and cost ly task.
Hydrology, climate, and physical characteristics of the dra inage area
should be considered for design purposes. Hydrologic conditions of
precipitate–runoff relationship (such as magnitude, frequency, and dura-
tion of the various runoffs, maximum events) and local conditions  (soil
types and moisture, evapotranspiration, size, shape, slope, la nd-use, etc.)
of the drainage (watershed) should be determined.
Clark and Viessman (1966) presented an example of hydraulic d esign
of urban storm drainage systems to carry 10-year storm runoffs from
eight inlets. A step-by-step solution of the problem was given.
7 Precipitation and Runoff
Precipitation includes rainfall, snow, hail, and sleet. It is one part of the
hydrologic cycle. Precipitation is the primary source of water in springs,
streams and rivers, lakes and reservoirs, groundwater, and well waters.Wastewater Engineering 551The US National Weather Service maintains observation stations
throughout the United States. The US Geological Survey operates
and maintains a national network of stream-flow gage stations
throughout the country’s major streams. State agencies, such  as the
Illinois State Water Survey and the Illinois Geological Surv ey, also
have some stream flow data similar to the national records. In  other
countries, similar governmental agencies also maintain long-t erm
precipitation, watershed runoff, stream flow data, and groundw ater
information.
Upon a catchment area (or watershed), some of the precipitation ru ns
off immediately to streams, lakes or lower land areas, while some evap-
orates from land to air or penetrates the ground (infiltration). S now
remains where it falls, with some evaporation. After snow melts,  the
water may run off as surface and groundwater.
Rainwater or melting snow that travels as overland flow acros s the
ground surface to the nearest channel is called surface runoff. S ome
water may infiltrate into the soil and flow laterally in the surface soil
to a lower land water body as interflow. A third portion of the w ater may
percolate downward through the soil until it reaches the groun d-water.
Overland flows and interflow are usually grouped together as di rect
runoff.
7.1 Rainfall intensity
The rainfall intensity is dependent on the recurrence interval a nd
the time of concentration. The intensity can be determined from the
cumulative rainfall diagram. From records of rainfall one can
format the relationship between intensity, and frequency as w ell as
duration. Their relationship is expressed as (Fair et al., 1966,
Wanielista, 1990)
(6.8)
where i /H11005rainfall intensity, in/h or cm/h
t /H11005frequency of occurrences, yr
d /H11005 duration of storm, min
a, b,m,n /H11005constants varying from place to place
By fixing a frequency of occurrence, the intensity–duration of n-year
rainstorm events can be drawn. For many year storm events, th e
intensity–duration–frequency curves (Fig. 6.1) can be formatted for
future use. The storm design requires some relationship between
expected rainfall intensity and duration.i5atm

/H9018(1/i2), /H9018(d/i;) then Aand B will be solved. For example, for a city of
5-year storm, i(mm/h) /H11005 5680/[42 /H11001 d(min)]. Similarly, a curve such as
that in Fig. 6.1 can be determined (42 /H11001d (min)).dad5Aa1

Figure 6.1 Intensity–duration–frequency curves.7.2 Time of concentration
The time for rainwater to flow overland from the most remote area of
the drainage area to an inlet is called the inlet time, ti. The time for water
to flow from this inlet through a branch sewer to the storm sewer  inlet
is called the time of sewer flow, ts. The time of concentration for a par-
ticular inlet to a storm sewer, t, is the sum of the inlet time and time of
sewer flow, i.e.
t/H11005 ti/H11001ts (6.10)
The inlet time can be estimated by

The time of concentration is difficult to estimate since the different
types of roof, size of housing, population density, land coverage, t opog-
raphy, and slope of land are very complicated. In general, th e time of con-
centration may be between 5 and 10 min for both the mains and  the
submains.
Example: The subdrain sewer line to a storm sewer is 1.620 km (1 mile). The
average flow rate is 1 m/s. Inlet time from the surface inlet th rough the over-
land is 7 min. Find the time of concentration to the storm sewer .

The quantity of stormwater runoff can be estimated by the rationa l method
or by the empirical formula. Each method has its advantages . The rational

C /H11005 runoff coefficient, see Table 6.2

The coefficient of runoff for a specific area depends upon the charac-
ter and the slope of the surface, the type and extent of vegetation, and
other factors. The approximate values of the runoff coefficient are shown
in Table 6.2. There are empirical formulas for the runoff coefficient.
However, the values of C in Table 6.2 are most commonly used.
Example: In a suburban residential area of 1000 acres (4.047 km2), the
rainfall intensity–duration of a 20-min 25-year storm is 6.1  in/h (155 mm/h).

8 Stormwater Quality
The quality and quantity of stormwaters depend on several factor s—
intensity, duration, and area extent of storms. The time interv al between
successive storms also has significant effects on both the quan tity and
quality of stormwater runoff. Land contours, urban location perm e-
ability, land uses and developments, population densities, i ncidence and
nature of industries, size and layout of sewer systems, and other  factors
are also influential.
Since the 1950s, many studies on stormwater quality indic ate that
runoff quality differs widely in pattern, background condition s, and
from location to location. Wanielista and Yousef (1993) summarized
runoff quality on city street, lawn surface, rural road, hig hway, and by
land-use categories. Rainwater quality and pollutant loadin g rates are
also presented.
8.1 National urban runoff program
In 1981 and 1982, the US EPA’s National Urban Runoff Progr am
(NURP) collected urban stormwater runoff data from 81 sites located

than 2300 separate storm events. Data was evaluated for solid s,
oxygen demand, nutrients, metals, toxic chemicals, and bac teria. The
median event mean concentrations (EMC) and coefficients of vari-
ance for ten standard parameters for four different land use cate-
gories are listed in Table 6.3 (US EPA 1983a). It was found t hat lead,
copper, and zinc are the most significant heavy metals found i n urban
runoff and showed the highest concentrations. The EMC for a storm
is determined by flow-weighted calculation.

8.3 Street and road loading rate
Rainfall will carry pollutants from the atmosphere and remove deposits
on impervious surfaces. The rainfall intensity, duration, and  storm
runoff affect the type and the amount of pollutants removed. Accordi ng
to the estimation by the US EPA (1974a), the times required for 9 0% par-
ticle removal from impervious surfaces are 300, 90, 60, and 3 0 min,
respectively for 0.1, 0.33, 0.50, and 1.00 in/h storms. A verage loading of

8.4 Runoff models
Several mathematical models have been proposed to predict water q ual-
ity characteristics from storm runoffs. A consortium of research con-
structions proposed an urban runoff model based on pollutants d eposited
on street surfaces and washed off by rainfall runoff. The amount of p ol-
lutants transported from a watershed ( dP) in any time interval ( dt)i s
proportional to the amount of pollutants remaining in the water shed ( P).
This assumption is a first-order reaction (discussed in Chapt er 1):

The amount removed (proposed model) is
P0/H11002P/H11005 P0(1/H11002e/H11002kt) (6.17)
where P0/H11005 amount of pollutant on the surface initially present, lb

The transport rate constant k is a factor proportional to the rate of

To determine b, it was assumed that a uniform runoff of 0.5 in/h would
wash 90% of the pollutant in 1 h (as stated above). We can cal culate b
from Eq. (6.16)
P/P0/H11005 0.1/H11005 e/H11002brt/H11005 e/H11002b(0.5 in/h) (1h)/H11005e/H110020.5b

Substituting b into Eq. 6.17 leads to the equation for impervious
surface areas
P0/H11002P/H11005 P0(1/H11002 e/H110024.6rt) (6.18)
Certain modifications to the basic model (Eq. (6.18)) for predicti ng total
suspended solids and BOD have been proposed to refine the agreement
between the observed and predicted values for these parameters. The
University of Cincinnati Department of Civil Engineering (197 0) devel-
oped a mathematical model for urban runoff quality based essenti ally
on the same principles and assumptions as in Eq. (6.18). Th e major dif-
ference is that an integral solution was developed by this grou p instead
of the stepwise solution suggested by the consortium. The amount of a
pollutant remaining on a runoff surface at a particular tim e, the rate of
runoff at that time, and the general characteristics of the wa tershed
were found to be given by the following relationship

9 Sewer Hydraulics
The fundamental concepts of hydraulics can be applied to both s anitary
sewers and stormwater drainage systems. Conservation of mass,
momentum, energy, and other hydraulic characteristics of cond uits are
discussed in Chapter 4 and elsewhere (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc.  1991;
WEF and ASCE, 1992) WEF and ASCE, (1992) also provide the desig n
guidelines for urban stormwater drainage systems, including  system
layout, sewer inlets, street and intersection, drainage ways (channels,
culverts, bridges), erosion control facilities, check dams, ener gy dissi-
pators, drop shaft, siphons, side-overflow weirs, flow splitters,  junc-
tions, flap gates, manholes, pumping, combined sewer systems,
evaluation and mitigation of combined sewer overflows, stormwater
impoundments, and stormwater management practices for water q ual-
ity enhancement, etc.
10 Sewer Appurtenances
The major appurtenances used for wastewater collection systems in clude
street (stormwater) inlets, catch basins, manholes, building  connection,
flushing devices, junctions, transitions, inverted siphons,  vertical drops,
energy dissipators, overflow and diversion structure, regulator s, outlets,
and pumping stations.
10.1 Street inlets
Street inlets are structures to transfer stormwater and street cleansing
wastewater to the storm sewers. The catch basin is an inlet w ith a basin
which allows debris to settle. There are four major types of inlet,  and
multiple inlets. Location and design of inlets should consider traffic
safety (for both pedestrian and vehicle) and comfort. Gutter inlet is
more efficient than curb inlet in capturing gutter flow, but clogging by53t
0qdt562 Chapter 6debris is a problem. Combination inlets are better. Various m anufactured
inlets and assembled gratings are available.
Street inlets are generally placed near the corner of the street, d epend-
ing on the street length. The distance between inlets depends on t he
amount of stormwater, the water depth of the gutter, and the depr es-
sion to the gutter. The permissible depth of stormwater in most U .S.
cities is limited to 6 in (15 cm) on residential streets.
Flow in the street gutter can be calculated by the Manning for mula,
modified for a triangular gutter cross section (McGhee, 1991):

n /H11005 roughness coefficient
/H11005 0.015 for smooth concrete gutters
s/H11005 slope of the gutter
y /H11005 water depth in the gutter at the curb
The water depth at the curve can be calculated from the flow and  the
street cross section and slope. The width over which the water w ill
spread is equal to yz.
Example 1: A street has a longitudinal slope of 0.81%, a transverse slope of
3.5%, a curb height of 15 cm (6 in), and a coefficient of surface roughness ( n)
of 0.016. The width of the street is 12 m (40 ft). Under storm des ign condi-
tions, 4 m of street width should be kept clear during the st orm. Determine
the maximum flow that can be carried by the gutter.
solution:
Step 1. Calculate the street spread limit, w
w/H11005 (12 m /H110024 m)/2 /H11005 4 m
Step 2. Calculate the curb depth (d) with the spread limit for a transverse
slope of 3.5%
d/H11005 4 m /H110030.035 /H11005 0.14 m /H11005 14 cm
The street gutter flow is limited by either the curb height (15 cm) or the curb
depth with the spread limit. Since
d/H11005 14 cm
a curb height of 14 cm is the limit factor for the gutter flow.Wastewater Engineering 563Step 3. Calculate the maximum gutter flow Q by Eq. (6.20)

10.2 Manholes
Manholes provide an access to the sewer for inspection and maint e-
nance operations. They also serve as ventilation, multiple pipe inter-
sections, and pressure relief. Most manholes are cylindrical i n shape.
The manhole cover must be secured so that it remains in place a nd
avoids a blow-out during peak flooding period. Leakage from around the
edges of the manhole cover should be kept to a minimum.
For small sewers, a minimum inside diameter of 1.2 m (4 ft) at the
bottom tapering to a cast-iron frame that provides a clear openi ng usu-
ally specified as 0.6 m (2 ft) has been widely adopted (WEF and A SCE,
1992). For sewers larger than 600 mm (24 in), larger manhole b ases are
needed. Sometimes a platform is provided at one side, or the manhol e
is simply a vertical shaft over the center of the sewer. Various  sizes and
types of manholes are available locally.
Manholes are commonly located at the junctions of sanitary sewer s,
at changes in grades or alignment except in curved alignmen ts, and at
locations that provide ready access to the sewer for preventive ma inte-
nance and emergency service. Manholes are usually installed a t street
intersections (Parcher, 1988).564 Chapter 6Manhole spacing varies with available sanitary sewer main tenance
methods. Typical manhole spacings range from 90 to 150 m (30 0 to 500
ft) in straight lines. For sewers larger than 1.5 m (5 ft), sp acings of 150
to 300 m (500 to 1000 ft) may be used (ASCE and WPCF, 1982).
Where the elevation difference between inflow and outflow sewers
exceeds about 0.5 m (1.5 ft), sewer inflow that is dropped to the eleva-
tion of the outflow sewer by an inside or outside connection is cal led a
drop manhole (or drop inlet). Its purpose is to protect workers from  the
splashing of wastewater, objectionable gases, and odors.
10.3 Inverted siphons (depressed sewers)
A sewer that drops below the hydraulic gradient to pass under  an
obstruction, such as a railroad cut, subway, highway, conduit, or stream,
is often called an inverted siphon. More properly, it should be called a
depressed sewer. Because a depressed sewer acts as a trap, the v eloc-
ity of sewer flow should be greater than 0.9 m/s (3 ft/s) or more for
domestic wastewater, and 1.25 to 1.5 m/s (4 to 5 ft/s) for stor mwater, to
prevent deposition of solids (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991). Thus , some-
times, two or more siphons are needed with an inlet splitter box .
In practice, minimum diameters for depressed sewers are usuall y the
same as for ordinary sewers: 150 or 200 mm (6 or 8 in) in san itary
sewers, and about 300 mm (12 in) in storm sewers (Metcalf and Eddy,
Inc. 1991).
The determination of the pipe size for depressed sewers is the same
as for water and wastewater mains. The size depends upon the max i-
mum wastewater flow and the hydraulic gradient.
Due to high velocities in depressed sewers, several pipes in par allel
are commonly used. For example, it may be that a small pipe m ay be
designed large enough to carry the minimum flow; a second pipe carries
the difference between the minimum and average flow (or maximum
dry-weather flow); and a third pipe carries peak flow above the a verage
flow. Depressed sewers can be constructed of ductile iron, concrete,  PVC,
or tile.
Example: Design a depressed sewer system using the following given
conditions:

Step 2. Design the inlet and outlet chambers
These depressed sewer pipes are connected from the inlet chamber and
outlet chamber. Weirs (2 m in length) are installed to divide the chamber into
three portions. The design detail can be found elsewhere (Metcalf and  Eddy,
Inc. 1981).
11 Pumping Stations
The pumping station must be able to adjust to the variations  of waste-
water flows. The smallest capacity pump should be able to pum p from
the wet well and discharge at a self-cleansing velocity of about  0.6 m/s
(2 ft/s). It should be connected to a 100-mm (4-in) force main whic h
would have a capacity of approximately 280 L/min or 74 gal/ min. The
wet well capacity should contain sufficient wastewater to perm it the
pump to run for at least 2 min and restart not more than onc e in 5 min
(Steel and McGhee, 1979). The pump running time ( tr) and the filling
time ( tf) in the wet well are computed as

The starting limitations on pump motors usually dictate th e minimum
size of a well. The wet well should be large enough to prevent pump
motors from overheating due to extensive cycling, but small enoug h to
accommodate cycling times that will reduce septicity and od or problems.
Typically, submersible pumps can cycle four to ten times per  hour. A max-
imum storage volume for a cycling time should be no more than 3 0 min.
If the selected pumps have a capacity equal to the peak (maxim um)
flow rate, the volume of a wet well is calculated as (WEF, 1993a )

A submergence of 0.3 m (1 ft) above the top of the suction pipe is req uired for
an intake velocity of 0.6 m/s (2 ft/s). The depth between the well bottom and
the top of submergence is 0.5 m (1.6 ft). If a 1.2-m (4-ft) diameter of wet well
is chosen, surface area is 1.13 m2(12.2 ft2).

ple a 10-in (254-mm) pressure class ductile iron pipe will be used.

12 Sewer Construction
Conduit material for sewer construction consists of two types: r igid pipe
and flexible pipe. Specified rigid materials include asbestos– cement,
cast iron, concrete, and vitrified clay. Flexible materials i nclude ductile
iron, fabricated steel, corrugated aluminum, thermoset plasti c (rein-
forced plastic mortar and reinforced thermosetting resin), and t hermo-
plastic. Thermoplastic consists of acrylonitrile–butadiene–st yrene (ABS),
ABS composite, polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Their
advantages, disadvantages, and applications are discuss ed in detail
elsewhere (ASCE and WPCF, 1982, WEF, and ASCE, 1993a).
Nonpressure sewer pipe is commercially available in the size ra nge
from 4 to 42 in (102 to 1067 mm) in diameter and 13 ft (4.0 m ) in length.
Half-length sections of 6.5 ft (2 m) are available for smaller size p ipes.
12.1 Loads and buried sewers
Loads on sewer lines are affected by conditions of flow, groundwater,
adjacent earth, and superimposed situation. Loads include hy draulic
loads, earth loads, groundwater loads, and superimposed loads  (weight
and impact of vehicles or other structure). Crushing strength  of the
sewer material, type of bedding, and backfill load are importa nt factors.
Marston’s equation. Figure 6.2 illustrates common cuts used for sewer
pipe installations. Marston’s equation is widely used to det ermine the
vertical load on buried conduits caused by earth forces in al l of the most572 Chapter 6

Load on sewer for trench condition. The load on a sewer conduit for the
trench condition is affected directly by the soil backfill. The load varies
widely over different soil types, from a minimum of approximately 100
lb/ft3(1600 kg/m3) to a maximum of about 135 lb/ft3(2160 kg/m3) (WEF
and ASCE, 1992). The unit weight (density) of backfill materia l is as fol-
lows (McGhee, 1991):
100 lb/ft3(1600 kg/m3) for dry sand, and sand and damp topsoil;
115 lb/ft3(1840 kg/m3) for saturated topsoil and ordinary sand;
120 lb/ft3(1920 kg/m3) for wet sand and damp clay; and 
130 lb/ft3(2080 kg/m3) for saturated clay.
The average maximum unit weight of soil which will constitut e the
backfill over the sewer pipe may be determined by density measur e-
ments in advance of the structural design of the sewer pipe. A d esign
value of not less than 120 or 125 lb/ft3(1920 or 2000 kg/m3) is recom-
mended (WEF and ASCE, 1992).mr5  tan  /H9021r tan  /H9021k5!m2112m

tion between the backfill and the side of the trench ( /H9262′) and by the coef-
ficient of internal friction of the backfill soil ( /H9262). For most cases these
two values are considered the same for design purposes. But, if t he
backfill is sharp sand and the sides of the trench are sheeted  with fin-
ished lumber, /H9262may be substantially greater than /H9262′. Unless specific
information to the contrary is available, values of the product s k/H9262and
k/H9262′may be assumed to be the same and equal to 0.103. If the back -
fill soil is slippery clay, k/H9262′and k/H9262′are equal to 0.110 (WEF and
ASCE, 1992).
The values of the product k/H9262′in Eq. (6.26) range from 0.10 to 0.16 for
most soils; specifically, 0.110 for saturated clay, 0.130 for clay, 0.150 for
saturated top soil, 0.165 for sand and gravel, and 0.192 for cohesionless
granular material (McGhee, 1991). Graphical solutions of Eq.  (6.26) are
presented elsewhere (ASCE and WPCF, 1982).
Example: A 20-in (508-mm) ductile iron pipe is to be installed in an ord i-
nary trench of 10 ft (3.05 m) depth at the top of the pipe and 4  ft (1.22 m) wide.
The cut will be filled with damp clay. Determine the load on t he sewer pipe.

13 Wastewater Treatment Systems
As discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, the natural waters in  streams, rivers,
lakes, and reservoirs have a natural waste assimilative ca pacity to
remove solids, organic matter, even toxic chemicals in the was tewater.
However, it is a long process. 51.92C512e22kmrH/B
2kmr512e22s0.11ds2.5d
2s0.11dH/B53.05 m/1.22 m  5  2.5kmr50.11574 Chapter 6Wastewater treatment facilities are designed to speed up the nat ural
purification process that occurs in natural waters and to remove con-
taminants in wastewater that might otherwise interfere with the nat-
ural process in the receiving waters.
Wastewater contains varying quantities of suspended and float ing
solids, organic matter, and fragments of debris. Conventional waste-
water treatment systems are combinations of physical and biol ogical
(sometimes with chemical) processes to remove its impurities.
The alternative methods for municipal wastewater treatment are
simply classified into three major categories: (1) primary (phy sical
process) treatment, (2) secondary (biological process) treatment, an d (3)
tertiary (combination of physical, chemical, and biological process) or
advanced treatment. As can be seen in Fig. 6.3, each category  should
include previous treatment devices (preliminary), disinfection, and sludge
management (treatment and disposal). The treatment devices shown in
the preliminary treatment are not necessarily to be included, depending
on the wastewater characteristics and regulatory requirements .
For over a century, environmental engineers and aquatic scienti sts
have developed wastewater treatment technologies. Many patented
treatment process and package treatment plants have been develop ed
and applied. The goal of wastewater treatment processes is to prod uce
clean effluents and to protect public health, natural resources , and the
ambient environment.
The Ten States Recommended Standards for Sewage Works, adopted
by the Great Lakes—Upper Mississippi River Board (GLUMRB), was
revised five times as a model for the design of wastewater treatment
plants and for the recommended standards for other regional and state
agencies. The original members of the ten states were Illinois, In diana,
Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsyl vania,
and Wisconsin. Recently, Ontario, Canada was added as a new member.
The new title of the standards is “Recommended Standards for
Wastewater Facilities—Policies for design, review, and approval of plans
and specifications for wastewater collection and treatment facil ities,”
1996 edition, by Great Lakes—Upper Mississippi River Board of State
and Provincial Public Health and Environmental Managers.
13.1 Preliminary treatment systems
Preliminary systems are designed to physically remove or cut u p the
larger suspended and floating materials, and to remove the heav y inor-
ganic solids and excessive amounts of oil and grease. The purpos e of pre-
liminary treatment is to protect pumping equipment and the subsequent
treatment units. Preliminary systems consist of flow measurement  devices
and regulators (flow equalization), racks and screens, comminut ingWastewater Engineering 575devices (grinders, cutters, and shredders), flow equalization, g rit cham-
bers, preaeration tanks, and (possibly) chlorination. The qual ity of waste-
water is not substantially improved by preliminary treatm ent.
13.2 Primary treatment systems
The object of primary treatment is to reduce the flow velocity of the
wastewater sufficiently to permit suspended solids to settle, i. e. to576 Chapter 6
Figure 6.3 Flow chart for wastewater treatment processes.
remove settleable materials. Floating materials are also removed b y
skimming. Thus, a primary treatment device may be called a  settling
tank (or basin). Due to variations in design and operation, s ettling tanks
can be divided into four groups: plain sedimentation with mec hanical
sludge removal, two story tanks (Imhoff tank, and several paten ted
units), upflow clarifiers with mechanical sludge removal, an d septic
tanks. When chemicals are applied, other auxiliary units a re needed.
Auxiliary units such as chemical feeders, mixing devices, and floccula-
tors (New York State Department of Health, 1950) and sludge (biosol ids)
management (treatment and dispose of) are required if there is no fur -
ther treatment.
The physical process of sedimentation in settling tanks removes
approximately 50% to 70% of total suspended solids from the wastew ater.
The BOD5removal efficiency by primary system is 25% to 35%. When
certain coagulants are applied in settling tanks, much of the colloidal as
well as the settleable solids, or a total of 80% to 90% of TSS, is removed.
Approximately 10% of the phosphorus corresponding insoluble is n or-
mally removed by primary settling. During the primary tr eatment
process, biological activity in the wastewater is negligibl e.
Primary clarification is achieved commonly in large sedimenta tion
basins under relatively quiescent conditions. The settled solid s are
then collected by mechanical scrapers into a hopper and pump ed to a
sludge treatment unit. Fats, oils, greases and other floating matter
are skimmed off from the basin surface. The settling basin effluent is
discharged over weirs into a collection conduit for further treat ment,
or to a discharging outfall.
In many cases, especially in developing countries, primary treatment
is adequate to permit the wastewater effluent discharge, due to p roper
receiving water conditions or to the economic situation. Unfortun ately,
many wastewaters are untreated and discharged in many coun tries. If
primary systems only are used, solids management and disin fection
processes should be included.
13.3 Secondary treatment systems
After primary treatment the wastewater still contains organi c matter
in suspended, colloidal, and dissolved states. This matter s hould be
removed before discharging to receiving waters, to avoid interferin g
with subsequent downstream users.
Secondary treatment is used to remove the soluble and colloidal
organic matter which remains after primary treatment. Alth ough the
removal of those materials can be effected by physicochemical means
providing further removal of suspended solids, secondary treatmen t is
commonly referred to as the biological process.Wastewater Engineering 577Biological treatment consists of application of a controlled nat ural
process in which a very large number of microorganisms consum e sol-
uble and colloidal organic matter from the wastewater in a rel atively
small container over a reasonable time. It is comparable to bi ological
reactions that would occur in the zone of recovery during the self-
purification of a stream.
Secondary treatment devices may be divided into two groups: at tached
and suspended growth processes. The attached (film) growth process es
are trickling filters, rotating biologic contactors (RBC) and  intermit-
tent sand filters. The suspended growth processes include activ ated
sludge and its modifications, such as contact stabilizati on (aeration)
tanks, sequencing batch reactors, aerobic and anaerobic dig estors,
anaerobic filters, stabilization ponds, and aerated lagoons. S econdary
treatment can also be achieved by physical–chemical or land  applica-
tion systems.
Secondary treatment processes may remove more than 85% of BOD5
and TSS. However, they are not effective for the removal of nutrients
(N and P), heavy metals, nonbiodegradable organic matter, bact eria,
viruses, and other microorganisms. Disinfection is needed to red uce
densities of microorganisms. In addition, a secondary clarifi er is required
to remove solids from the secondary processes. Sludges generated from
the primary and secondary clarifiers need to undergo treatment and
proper disposal.
13.4 Advanced treatment systems
Advanced wastewater treatment is defined as the methods and pr ocesses
that remove more contaminants from wastewater than the convention al
treatment. The term advanced treatment may be applied to any s ystem
that follows the secondary, or that modifies or replaces a step i n the con-
ventional process. The term tertiary treatment is often used as a  syn-
onym; however, the two are not synonymous. A tertiary system is the
third treatment step that is used after primary and seconda ry treatment
processes.
Since the early 1970s, the use of advanced wastewater treatment
facilities has increased significantly in the United States . Most of their
goals are to remove nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended solids (i nclud-
ing BOD5) and to meet certain regulations for specific conditions. In so me
areas where water supply sources are limited, reuse of waste-water  is
becoming more important. Also, there are strict rules and regu lations
regarding the removal of suspended solids, organic matter, nut rients,
specific toxic compounds and refractory organics that cannot be achieved
by conventional secondary treatment systems as well as some in dustrial
wastewater; thus, advanced wastewater treatment processes are needed.578 Chapter 6In the U.S. federal standards for secondary effluent are BOD 30 mg/L
and TSS 30 mg/L. In Illinois, the standards are more strin gent: BOD
20 mg/L and TSS 25 mg/L for secondary effluent. In some areas, 10  to
12 (BOD /H1100510 mg/L and TSS /H1100512 mg/L) standards are implied. For
ammonia nitrogen standards, very complicated formulas dependi ng on
the time of the year and local conditions are used.
In the European Community, the European Community Commission
for Environmental Protection has drafted the minimum effluent stan -
dards for large wastewater treatment plants. The standards i nclude:
BOD5 /H1102125 mg/L, COD /H11021125 mg/L, suspended solids /H1102135 mg/L, total
nitrogen /H1102110 mg/L, and phosphorus /H110211 mg/L. Stricter standards are
presented in various countries. The new regulations were expected t o
be ratified in 1998 (Boehnke et al., 1997).
TSS concentrations less than 20 mg/L are difficult to achieve b y sed-
imentation through the primary and secondary systems. The pu rpose
of advanced wastewater treatment techniques is specifically to reduce
TSS, TDS, BOD, organic nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, total nit rogen, or
phosphorus. Biological nutrient removal processes can eliminat e nitro-
gen or phosphorus, and any combination.
Advanced processes use some processes for the drinking water treat -
ment. These include chemical coagulation of wastewater, wedge-wire
screens, granular media filters, diatomaceous earth filters, m icro-
screening, and ultrafiltration and nanofiltration, which a re used to
remove colloidal and fine-size suspended solids.
For nitrogen control, techniques such as biological assimilat ion, nitri-
fication (conversion of ammonia to nitrogen and nitrate), and deni trifi-
cation, ion exchange, breakpoint chlorination, air strippin g are used.
Soluble phosphorus may be removed from wastewater by chemical pr e-
cipitation and biological (bacteria and algae) uptake for norm al cell
growth in a control system. Filtration is required after chemi cal and bio-
logical processes. Physical processes such as reverse osmosis an d ultra-
filtration also help to achieve phosphorus reduction, but these are
primarily for overall dissolved inorganic solids reduction. O xidation
ditch, Bardenpho process, anaerobic/oxidation (A/O) process, an d other
patented processes are available.
The use of lagoons, aerated lagoons, and natural and constructed
wetlands is an effective method for nutrients (N and P) removal.
Removal of some species of groups of toxic compounds and refractory
organics can be achieved by activated carbon adsorption, ai r stripping,
activated sludge powder, activated-carbon processes, and chemi cal oxi-
dation. Conventional coagulation–sedimentation–filtration and biolog-
ical treatment (trickling filter, RBC, and activated slud ge) processes
are also used to remove the priority pollutants and some refractor y
organic compounds.Wastewater Engineering 57913.5 Compliance with standards
The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) ha s
promulgated discharge standards to protect and preserve benefic ial
uses of receiving water bodies based on water quality criteria,  or
technology-based limits, or both. The receiving water quality c riteria are
typically established for a 7-day, 10-year, low-flow period.

The values in Table 6.7 are still relevant as far as nationa l standards
go; however, they really do not have much applicability in I llinois and
many other states because state standards for most facilities are more
stringent than the national standards. For example, in Ill inois, most
POTWs must meet monthly averages of 10/12 (10 mg/L of BOD5 and
12 mg/L of SS) effluent standards if the dilution factor is less than 5:1.
The daily maximum effluent concentrations are 20/24. For lagoon effl u-
ents, the standards are 30/30 if the dilution factor is grea ter than 5:1.
The NPDES applies to each facility of interest because most have s ome
water quality based effluent limits, especially for ammonia. Th e Illinois
state effluent standards are in Title 35, Subtile C, Chapter  II, Part 370
(IEPA, 1997) which can be found on the Illinois Pollution Contr ol Board’s
web site at http:/www.state.il.us/title35/35conten.htm.
14 Screening Devices
The wastewater from the sewer system either flows by gravity or is
pumped into the treatment plant. Screening is usually the fi rst unit
operation at wastewater treatment plants. The screening units include
racks, coarse screens, and fine screens. The racks and screens used in
preliminary treatment are to remove large objects such as rags , plastics,
paper, metals, dead animals, and the like. The purpose is to protect
pumps and to prevent solids from fouling subsequent treatment fa cilities.
14.1 Racks and screens
Coarse screens are classified as either bar racks (trash rack s) or bar
screens, depending on the spacing between the bars. Bar racks  have
clear spacing of 5.08 to 10.16 cm (2.0 to 4.0 in), whereas b ar screens typ-
ically have clear spacing of 0.64 to 5.08 cm (0.25 to 2.0 in). Both consist
of a vertical arrangement of equally spaced parallel bars desi gned to trap
coarse debris. The debris captured on the bar screen depends on t he bar
spacing and the amount of debris caught on the screen (WEF, 19 96a).
Clear openings for manually cleaned screens between bars should be
from 25 to 44 mm (1 to ). Manually cleaned screens should be
placed on a slope of 30 to 45 degrees to the horizontal. For manuall y or
mechanically raked bar screens, the maximum velocities duri ng peak
flow periods should not exceed 0.76 m/s (2.5 ft/s) (Ten States Sta ndards
(GLUMRB) 1996; Illinois EPA, 1998).
Hydraulic losses through bar racks are a function of approach
(upstream) velocity, and the velocity through the bars (downstr eam),13

Note : If we want to calculate the headloss through the rack at 50 % clog-
ging, many engineers use an approximate method. When the rack becomes
half-plugged, the area of the flow is reduced to one half, and veloci ty
through the rack is doubled. Thus the headloss will be 0.260  m (four times
0.065 m).
14.2 Fine screens
Fine screens are used more frequently in wastewater treatment plan ts
for preliminary treatment or preliminary/primary treatment p urposes.
Fine screens typically consist of wedge-wire, perforated plate, or c losely
spaced bars with openings 1.5 to 6.4 mm (0.06 to 0.25 in).  Fine screens
used for preliminary treatment are rotary or stationary-type un its
(US EPA 1987a).
The clean water headloss through fine screens may be obtained from
manufacturers’ rating tables, or may be computed by means of t he
common orifice equation

Q /H11005discharge through the screen, m3/s or ft3/s
A/H11005area of effective opening of submerged screen, m2or ft2
Values of C depend on the size and milling of slots, the diameter and
weave of the wire, and the percentage of open area. They must be deter-
mined experimentally. A typical value of C for a clean screen is 0.60. The
headloss of clean water through a clean screen is relatively les s.
However, the headloss of wastewater through a fine screen during oper -
ation depends on the method and frequency of cleaning, the size and
quantity of suspended solids in the wastewater, and the size of the
screen opening.
The quantity of screenings generated at wastewater treatment pla nts
varies with the bar opening, type of screen, wastewater flow, ch arac-
teristics of served communities, and type of collection system. R oughly,h51

2g sin  uWastewater Engineering 5853.5 to 35 L (0.93–9.25 gal) of screenings is produced from 100 0 m3
(264, 200 gal) wastewater treated. Screenings are normally 1 0% to 20%
dry solids, with bulk density of 640 to 1120 kg/m3(40 to 70 lb/ft3) (WEF
and ASCE, 1991a).
15 Comminutors
As an alternative to racks or screens, a comminutor or shredd er cuts and
grinds up the coarse solids in the wastewater to about 6 to 1 0 mm (1/4
to 3/8 in) so that the solids will not harm subsequent treat ment equip-
ment. The chopped or ground solids are then removed in primary s edi-
mentation basins. A comminutor consists of a fixed screen and a  moving
cutter. Comminution can eliminate the messy and offensive screeni ngs
for solids handling and disposal. However, rags and large obj ects cause
clogging problems.
Comminutors are installed directly in the wastewater flow cha nnel
and are equipped with a bypass so that the unit can be is olated for serv-
ice maintenance. The sizes, installations, operation, and main tenance
of the comminutors are available from the manufactures.
16 Grit Chamber
Grit originates from domestic wastes, stormwater runoff, indust rial
wastes, pumpage from excavations, and groundwater seepage. It con-
sists of inert inorganic material such as sand, cinders, rocks, gravel,
cigarette filter tips, metal fragments, etc. In addition gri t includes
bone chips, eggshells, coffee grounds, seeds, and large food wastes
(organic particles). These substances can promote excessive wear of
mechanical equipment and sludge pumps, and even clog pipes by
deposition.
Composition of grit varies widely, with moisture content rangi ng from
13% to 63%, and volatile content ranging from 1% to 56%. The speci fic
gravity of clean grit particles may be as high as 2.7 wi th inert material,
and as low as 1.3 when substantial organic matter is ag glomerated with
inert. The bulk density of grit is about 1600 kg/m3or 100 lb/ft3(Metcalf
and Eddy, Inc. 1991).
Grit chambers should be provided for all wastewater treatment plants,
and are used on systems required for plants receiving sewage from  com-
bined sewers or from sewer systems receiving a substantial amou nt of
ground garbage or grit. Grit chambers are usually instal led ahead of
pumps and comminuting devices.
Grit chambers for plants treating wastewater from combined sew ers
usually have at least two hand cleaned units, or a mechani cally cleaned
unit with bypass. There are three types of grit settling cham ber: hand586 Chapter 6cleaned, mechanically cleaned, and aerated or vortex-type degrit ting
units. The chambers can be square, rectangular, or circula r. A velocity
of 0.3 m/s (1 ft/s) is commonly used to separate grit from the org anic
material. Typically, 0.0005 to 0.00236 m3/s (1 to 5 ft3/min) of air per foot
of chamber length is required for a proper aerated grit chamber;  or 4.6
to 7.7 L/s per meter of length. The transverse velocity at the sur face
should be 0.6 to 0.8 m/s or 2 to 2.5 ft/s (WEF, 1996a).
Grit chambers are commonly constructed as fairly shallow lon gitu-
dinal channels to catch high specific gravity grit (1.65 ). The units are
designed to maintain a velocity close to 0.3 m/s (1.0 ft/s) an d to pro-
vide sufficient time for the grit particle to settle to the bottom of the
chamber.
Example: The designed hourly average flow of a municipal wastewater
plant is 0.438 m3/s (10 Mgal/d). Design an aerated grit chamber where the
detention time of the peak flow rate is 4.0 min (generally 3 to 5 min).

17 Flow Equalization
The Parshall flume is commonly used in wastewater treatment pla nts.
Methods of flow measurement are discussed in Chapter 4.
The incoming raw wastewater varies with the time of the day, t he so-
called diurnal variation, ranging from less than one half t o more than
200% of the average flow rate. A storm event increases the flow. Flow
equalization is used to reduce the sudden increase of inflow and t o bal-
ance the fluctuations in the collection system or in the in-pla nt storage
basins. This benefits the performance of the downstream treatment
processes and reduces the size and cost of treatment units.
Flow equalization facilities include the temporary storage of flows in
existing sewers, the use of in-line or on-line separate flow-equalizati on
facilities or retention basins.
The volume for a flow equalization basin is determined from mass di a-
grams based on average diurnal flow patterns.
Example: Determine a flow equalization basin using the following diurnal
flow record:588 Chapter 6solution 1:

The required volume for the flow equalization basin for this day is  the
maximum cumulative storage. In this case, it is 882.72 m3at 8 p.m.

capacity for unexpected flow variations, equipment, and solids  deposition.

volume at Y-axis to produce a mass curve
Step 3. Connect the origin and the final point on the mass cur ve
This gives the daily average flow rate (m3/d or Mgal/d).

Sedimentation is the process of removing solid particles heavier than
water by gravity settling. It is the oldest and most widel y used unit oper-
ation in water and wastewater treatments. The terms sedimentat ion,
settling, and clarification are used interchangeably. The un it sedimen-
tation basin may also be referred to as a sedimentation tank, clarifier,
settling basin, or settling tank.
In wastewater treatment, sedimentation is used to remove both in or-
ganic and organic materials which are settleable in contin uous-flow con-
ditions. It removes grit, particulate matter in the primar y settling tank,
and chemical flocs from a chemical precipitation unit. Sedim entation is
also used for solids concentration in sludge thickeners.
Based on the solids concentration, and the tendency of particle inter-
action, there are four types of settling which may occur in wa ste-water set-
tling operations. The four categories are discrete, flocculant, hi ndered
(also called zone), and compression settlings. They are also known as types
1, 2, 3, and 4 sedimentation, respectively. Some discussion of sedimenta-
tion is covered in Chapter 5. The following describes each type of settling.
18.1 Discrete particle sedimentation (type 1)
The plain sedimentation of a discrete spherical particle, descr ibed by
Newton’s law, can be applied to grit removal in grit chamb ers and sed-
imentation tanks. The terminal settling velocity is determined  as (also
in Chapter 5, Eq. (5.60))

Discrete particle settling refers to type 1 sedimentation. Under  qui-
escent conditions, suspended particles in water or wastewater exhibit
a natural tendency to agglomerate, or the addition of coagulant  chem-
icals promotes flocculation. The phenomenon is called flocculation–
sedimentation or type 2 sedimentation. For flocculated particles the
principles of settling are the same as for a discrete particle,  but settling
merely occurs at a faster rate.
18.2 Scour
The horizontal velocity in grit chambers or in sedimentation ta nks must
be controlled to a value less than what would carry the part icles in trac-
tion along the bottom. The horizontal velocity of fluid flow just su fficient
to create scour is described as (Camp, 1946)

acteristics of the settled solids. The horizontal velocity in most  sedi-
mentation tanks is well below that which would cause scour.  In grit
chambers, scour is an important factor for design.
Example: Determine the surface overflow rate and horizontal velocity of a
grit chamber to remove the grit without removing organic mater ial. Assume
that grit particles have a diameter of 0.2 mm (0.01 in) and  a specific gravity
of 2.65 (sand, silt, and clay); and organic material has the same diameter and
a specific gravity of 1.20. Assume CD/H1100510.

velocity) of 2.1 cm/s and a horizontal velocity less than 22.8  cm/s but greater

matter will not. If the horizontal velocity is close to the scour  velocity, the grit
will be reasonably clean.
18.3 Sedimentation tank (basin)
conﬁguration
Sedimentation tanks can be rectangular, square or circular . Imhoff
tanks perform the dual function of settling and aerobic treatmen t with
two-story chambers; however, the Imhoff tank is old technology and  is
no longer allowed in the developed countries.
For a continuous flow sedimentation tank, the shape can be either  rec-
tangular or circular. Camp (1953) divided the ideal sedimen tation tank
into four zones which affect settling, namely the inlet zone, theoreti cal
effective settling zone, sludge zone (beneath the settling zone), and
outlet zone (Fig. 6.6). The inlet and outlet condition and tank geom etry
influence short circuiting, which can be minimized in narr ow rectangular
horizontal flow basins. Short circuiting is a common problem in circu-
lar radial flow clarifiers.
Figure 6.6 illustrates an ideal rectangular continuous hori zontal flow
settling tank. The inlet zone uniformly distributes wastewater flows
and solids over the cross-sectional area of the tank in such a manner that
flow through the settling zone follows horizontal paths to prevent s hort
circuiting. In the settling zone, a uniform concentration of pa rticles set-
tles at terminal settling velocity to the sludge zone at the bot tom of the
tank. In the real world, there is no theoretical effective settlin g zone.
Particle settling vectors are difficult to predict. However, it i s usually
assumed that the flow of wastewater through the settling zone is steadyWastewater Engineering 595
Figure 6.6 Sketch of the discrete particle settling in an ideal settling tank.and that the concentration of each sized particle is uniform th roughout
the cross section normal to the flow direction. The sludge zone is a
region for storing the settled sediments below the settling zone. Thi s
zone may be neglected for practical purposes, if mechanical equip ment
continually removes the sediment. In the outlet zone, the supernat ant
(clarified effluent) is collected through an outlet weir and disch arged to
further treatment units or to the outfall.
In the design of clarifiers, a particle terminal velocity V0is used as a
design overflow settling velocity, which is the settling veloci ty of the
particle which will settle through the total effective depth H of the tank
in the theoretical detention time. All particles that have a terminal
velocity ( Vs) equal to or greater than V0will be removed. The surface
overflow rate of wastewater is (Stoke’s law)

The settling velocity distribution for a suspension sample can  be
determined from a column settling test. The data obtained from th e
test can be used to construct a cumulative settling velocity  frequency dis-
tribution curve, as shown in Fig. 6.7.
For a given clarification flow rate Q, only those particles having set-

the portion of particles with a settling velocity /H11021V0; then the percent-
age removed will be 1 /H11002y0. Also, for each size particle with Vs/H11021 V0its

18.4 Flocculant settling (type 2)
In practice, the actual settling performance cannot be adequa tely pre-
dicted because of unrealistic assumptions on ideal discrete pa rticle
settling. Under quiescent conditions, suspended particles in  water or
wastewater exhibit a natural tendency to agglomerate. Also, s us-
pended solids in wastewater are not discrete particles and va ry more
than light and small particles, as they contact and ag glomerate and
grow in size. As coalescence of flocculation occurs, including c hemi-
cal coagulation and biological flocs, the mass of the particl es increases
and they settle faster. This phenomenon is called flocculant or t ype 2
sedimentation.
The flocculation process increases removal efficiency but it cannot  be
adequately expressed by equations. Settling-column analysis i s usually
used to determine the settling characteristics of flocculated pa rticles. A
column can be of any diameter and equal in length to the propos ed clar-
ifier. Satisfactory results can be achieved with 15 cm (6 in ) diameter plas-
tic tube 3 m (10 ft) in height (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991 ). Sampling
ports are uniformly spaced (45 to 60 cm or 1.5 to 2 ft) along t he length
of the column. The test suspension is placed in the settle-column and
allowed to settle in a quiescent manner. The initial suspended solids con-
centration is measured. Samples are withdrawn from the sampl ing
ports at various selected time intervals from different depths. A nalyses
of SS are performed for each sample, and the data used to calcula te the
percentage of removal is plotted as a number against time and depth.
Between the plotted points, curves of equal percent removal are dra wn.
The results of settling-column analyses are presented in Fig. 6.8 . Use
of the curves in Fig. 6.8 is illustrated in the following exam ple.
Example: Using the settling curves of Fig. 6.8, determine the overall rem oval
of solids in a sedimentation basin (type 2 flocculant settling ) with a depth
equal to the test cylinder and at a detention time of 25 min. The total depth
is 2.5 m. 592% 50.92 50.7510.0569/0.33F5s12y0d11

Figure 6.8 Settling trajectory characteristics for flocculent particles.18.5 Hindered sedimentation (type 3)
In systems with high concentrations of suspended solids, the velocity
fields of closely spaced particles are obstructed, causing an upward dis-
placement of the fluid and hindered or zone settling (type 3) and c om-
pression settling (type 4). In addition, discrete (free) settling (type 1) and
flocculant settling (type 2) occur. This settling phenomenon of con cen-
trated suspensions (such as activated sludge) is illustrat ed in a gradu-
ated cylinder, as shown in Fig. 6.9. 573.7%   removal10.1437510.23390d 54010.4s0.534510.3235510.203651/H9004h2

Equation (6.48) is valid for Reynolds numbers less than 0.2,  which is gen-
erally the situation in hindered settling.
A typical curve of interface height versus time for activated sl udge is
shown in Fig. 6.10. From A to B, there is a hindered settling of the par-
ticles and this is called liquid interface. From B to C ther e is a deceler-
ation marking the transition from hindered settling into the compressionWastewater Engineering 603
Figure 6.10 Graphic analysis of interface.zone. From C to D there is a compression zone where settling depends
on compression of the sludge blanket.
The system design for handling concentrated suspensions for hin-
dered settling must consider three factors: (1) the area needed for d is-
crete settling of particles at the top of the clarifier; (2) the ar ea needed
for thickening (settling of the interface between the discrete and h in-
dered settling zones); and (3) the rate of sludge withdrawal. The s ettling
rate of the interface is usually the controlling factor.
Column settling tests, as previously described, can be used to deter-
mine the area needed for hindered settling. The height of the interfac e
is plotted against time, as shown in Fig. 6.10. The area need ed for clar-
ification is

A value of vsis determined from batch settling column test data by com-

from the batch settling test of a thick suspension. The critic al area

From Fig. 6.10, the critical concentration ( C2) is determined by extend-
ing the tangent from the hindered and compression settling lin es to
their point of intersection and bisecting the angle formed. The bi sector
intersects the subsidence curve at C2which is the critical concentration.
The critical concentration controls the sludge-handling capac ity of the
tank at a height of H2.
A tangent is drawn to the subsidence curve at C2and the intersec-
tion of this tangent with depth Hu, required for the desired underflow
(or solids concentration Cu), will yield the required retention time tu.
Since the total weight of solids in the system must remain con stant, i.e.A5Qtu

The time tucan be determined as:
Draw a horizontal line through Huand draw a tangent to the subsidence
settling curve at C2. Draw a vertical line from the point of intersection
of the two lines drawn above to the time axis to find the value of tu. With
this value of tu, the area needed for thickening can be calculated using
Eq. (6.50). The area required for clarification is then determined . The
larger of the two calculated areas is the controlling factor for design from
Eqs. (6.49) and (6.50).
Example: The batch-settling curve shown in Fig. 6.10 is obtained for an
activated sludge with an initial solids concentration C0of 3600 mg/L. The ini-
tial height of the interface in the settling column is 900 mm . This continu-
ous inflow to the unit is 380 m3/d (0.10 Mgal/d). Determine the surface area
required to yield a thickened sludge of 1.8 percent by weight. Also determine
solids and hydraulic loading rate.

increased resistance to flow of the fluid.
The volume needed for the sludge in the compression region (thick-
ening) can also be estimated by settling tests. The rate of consol idation
in this region has been found to be approximately proportional t o the
difference in sludge height H at time t and the final sludge height H/H11009
obtained after a long period of time, perhaps 1 day. It is expr essed as

or
(6.54)
A plot of ln versus ( t – t1) is a straight line
having the slope – i. The final sludge height H/H11009depends on the liquid
surface film which adheres to the particles.
It has been found that gentle stirring serves to compact slud ge in the
compression region by breaking up the floc and permitting wat er to
escape. The use of mechanical rakes with 4 to 5 revolutions per h our will
serve this purpose. Dick and Ewing (1967) reported that gentl e stirring
also helped to improve settling in the hindered settling region.
19 Primary Sedimentation Tanks
Primary treatment has traditionally implied a sedimentation  process to
separate the readily settleable and floatable solids from the was te-
water. The treatment unit used to settle raw wastewater is referr ed to
as the primary sedimentation tank (basin), primary tank (b asin), or
primary clarifier. Sedimentation is the oldest and most widel y used
process in the effective treatment of wastewater.
After the wastewater passes the preliminary processes, it enters  sed-
imentation tanks. The suspended solids that are too light to fa ll out in
the grit chamber will settle in the tank over a few hours. The settled[sHt2H`]2lnsH12H`dist2t1d5lnsHt2H`d2lnsH12H`dHt2H`5sH12H`de2ist2t1ddH
dt5isH2H`dWastewater Engineering 607sludge is then removed by mechanical scrapers, or pumped. The float-
able substances on the tank surface are removed by a surface sk immer
device. The effluent flows to the secondary treatment units or is di s-
charged off (not in the United States and some countries).
The primary sedimentation tank is where the flow velocity of the
wastewater is reduced by plain sedimentation. The process common ly
removes particles with a settling rate of 0.3 to 0.6 mm/s (0. 7 to 1.4 in/min).
In some cases, chemicals may be added. The benefits of primary s edimen-
tation are reduced suspended solids content, equalization of sides tream
flow, and BOD removal. The overflow rate of the primary sedimentati on
tanks ranges from 24.5 to 49 m3/(m2/H11080d) (600 to 1200 gal/(d /H11080ft2)). The
detention time in the tank is usually 1 to 3 h (typically 2 h). Primary
tanks (or primary clarifiers) should remove 90% to 95% of settleabl e
solids, 50% to 60% of total suspended solids, and 25% to 35% of th e
BOD5(NY Department of Health, 1950).
Settling characteristics in the primary clarifier are gener ally charac-
terized by type 2 flocculant settling. The Stokes formula for settl ing veloc-
ity cannot be used because the flocculated particles are contin uously
changing in shape, size, and specific gravity. Since no ma thematical equa-
tion can describe flocculant settling satisfactorily, labora tory analyses of
settling-column tests are commonly used to generate design informa tion.
Some recommended standards for the design of primary clarifiers a re
as follows (GLUMRB–Ten States Standards, 1996; Illinois EPA , 1998).
Multiple tanks capable of independent operation are desirable an d shall
be provided in all plants where design average flows exceed 380 m3/d
(100,000 gal/d). The minimum length of flow from inlet to outlet s hould
be 3.0 m (10 ft) unless special provisions are made to prevent s hort cir-
cuiting. The side depth for primary clarifiers shall be as s hallow as
practicable, but not less than 3.0 m (10 ft). Hydraulic su rface settling
rates (overflow rates) of the clarifier shall be based on the antici pated
peak hourly flow. For normal domestic wastewater, the overflow rate,
with some indication of BOD removal, can be obtained from Fig. 6 .11.
If waste-activated sludge is returned to the primary clarifier , the design
surface settling rate shall not exceed 41 m3/(m2/H11080d) (1000 gal/(d /H11080ft2)).
The maximum surfaced settling rate for combined sewer overflow and
bypass settling shall not exceed 73.3 m3/(m2/H11080d) (1800 gal/(d /H11080ft2)), based
on peak hourly flow. Weir loading rate shall not exceed 250 m3/d linear
meter (20,000 gal/(d /H11080ft)), based on design peak hourly flow for plants
having a design average of 3785 m3/d (1 Mgal/d) or less. Weir loading
rates shall not exceed 373 m3/(d2 /H11080 m) (30,000 gal/(d /H11080ft)), based on peak
design hourly flow for plants having a design average flow grea ter than
3785 m3/d (1.0 Mgal/d). Overflow rates, side water depths, and weir
loading rates recommended by various institutions for primary  settling
tanks are listed elsewhere (WEF and ASCE, 1991a).608 Chapter 6In cases where a reliable loading–performance relationship is n ot
available, the primary tank design may be based on the overfl ow rates
and side water depths listed in Table 6.10. The design surfa ce settling
is selected on the basis of Fig. 6.11 and Table 6.10. The hydr aulicWastewater Engineering 609

minimumdetention time t in the primary clarifier can be calculated from
Eq. (6.44). The hydraulic detention times for primary clarifier  design
range from 1.5 to 2.5 h, typically 2 h. Consideration shoul d be made for
low flow period to ensure that longer detention times will not cau se
septic conditions. Septic conditions may cause a potential od or problem,
stabilization and loading to the downstream treatment processes . In the
cold climatic region, a detention time multiplier should be i ncluded
when wastewater temperature is below 20 /H11034C (68 /H11034F). The multiplier can
be calculated by the following equation (Water Pollution Control
Federation, 1985a)
M/H110051.82e/H110020.03T(6.55)
where M/H11005detention time multiplier

In practice, the linear flow-through velocity (scour velocity) is  limited
to 1.2 to 1.5 m/min (4 to 5 ft/min) to avoid resuspension of sett led solids
in the sludge zone (Theroux and Betz, 1959). Camp (1946) suggested that
the critical scour velocity can be computed by Eq. (6.39). S couring veloc-
ity may resuspend settled solids and must be avoided with c larifier
design. Camp (1953) reported that horizontal velocities up to 18  ft/min
(9 cm/s) may not create scouring; but design horizontal velocit ies should
still be designed substantially below 18 ft/min. As long a s scouring veloc-
ities are not approached, solids removal in the clarifier is i ndependent
of the tank depth.

area required is the flow divided by the selected overflow rate. An  over-
flow rate of 36 m3/(m2/H11080d) (884 gal/(ft2/H11080d)) at average design flow is gen-
erally acceptable.
Basin surface dimensions, the length ( l) to width ( w) ratio ( l/w), can
be increased or decreased without changing the volume of the basi n. The
greater the l/w ratio, the better the basin conforms to plug flow condi-
tions. Also, for greater l/w ratio, the basin has a proportionally larger
effective settling zone and smaller percent inlet and outlet zones.
Increased basin length allows the development of a more stable flow .
Best conformance to the plug flow model has been reported by a basi n
with l/w ratio of 3:1 or greater (Aqua-Aerobic Systems, 1976).
Basin design should be cross-checked for detention time for confor-
mance with recommended standards by the regulatory agencies.
For bean bridge (cross the basin) design, a commercially avail able eco-
nomical basin width can be used, such as 1.5 m (5 ft), 3. 0 m (10 ft), 5.5 m
(18 ft), 8.5 m (28 ft) or 11.6 m (38 ft).
The inlet structures in rectangular clarifiers are placed at  one end and
are designed to dissipate the inlet velocity to diffuse the flow equ ally
across the entire cross section of the basin and to prevent short  circuit-
ing. Typical inlets consist of small pipes with upward el ls, perforated baf-
fles, multiple ports discharging against baffles, a single pipe turned
back to discharge against the headwall, simple weirs, sub merged weirs
sloping upward to a horizontal baffle, etc. (Steel and McGhee, 19 79;
McGhee, 1991). The inlet structure should be designed not to tra p scum
or settling solids. The inlet channel should have a velocity of 0.3 m/s
(1 ft/s) at one half design flow (Ten States Standards, GLUMRB, 1996).
Baffles are installed 0.6 to 0.9 m (2 to 3 ft) in front of inlets to assist
in diffusing the flow and submerged 0.45 to 0.60 m (1.5 to 2 ft) with 5 cm
(2 in) water depth above the baffle to permit floating material to pass.
Scum baffles are placed ahead of outlet weirs to hold back floatin g mate-
rial from the basin effluent and extend 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in ) below the
water surface (Ten States Standards, GLUMRB, 1971). Outlets in a rec-
tangular basin consist of weirs located toward the discharg e end of the
basin. Weir loading rates range from 250 to 373 m3/(d /H11080m) (20,000 to
30,000 gal/(d /H11080ft)) (Ten State Standards, GLUMRB, 1996).
Walls of settling tanks should extend at least 150 mm (6 in ) above
the surrounding ground surface and shall provide not less th an 300 mm
(12 in) freeboard (GLUMRB, 1996).
Mechanical sludge collection and withdrawal facilities are usually
designed to assure rapid removal of the settled solids. The minim um
slope of the side wall of the sludge hopper is 1.7 vertical to 1 horizon-
tal. The hopper bottom dimension should not exceed 600 mm (2 ft). Th e
sludge withdrawal line is at least 150 mm (6 in) in diam eter and has a612 Chapter 6static head of 760 mm (30 in) or greater with a velocity of 0.9  m/s (3 ft/s)
(Ten States Standards, GLUMRB, 1996).
Example: Design a primary clarification system for a design average w aste-
water flow of 7570 m3/d (2.0 Mgal/d) with a peak hourly flow of 18,900 m3/d
(5.0 Mgal/d) and a minimum flow of 4540 m3/d (1.2 Mgal/d). Design a multi-
ple units system using Ten States Standards for an estimat ed 35% BOD5

19.2 Circular basin design
Inlets in circular or square basins are typically at th e center and the
flow is directed upward through a baffle that channels the wa stewater
(influent) toward the periphery of the tank. Inlet baffles are 10% t o 20%
of the basin diameter and extend 0.9 to 1.8 m (3 to 6 ft) below t he
wastewater surface (McGhee, 1991).
Circular basins have a higher degree of turbulence than recta ngular
basins. Thus circular basins are more efficient as flocculator s.
A typical depth of sidewall of a circular tank is 3 m (10 ft ). As shown
in Fig. 6.12, the floor slope of the tank is typically 300 mm  (12 in) hor-
izontal to 25 mm (1 in) vertical (Aqua-Aerobic Systems, 1976).
Outlet weirs extend around the periphery of the tank with baffles
extending 200 to 300 mm (8 to 12 in) below the wastewater surfa ce to
retain floating material (McGhee, 1991). Overflow weirs shall b e located
to optimum actual hydraulic detention time and minimize shor t circuiting.614 Chapter 6Peripheral weirs shall be placed at least 300 cm (1 ft) from th e well (Ten
States Standards, GLUMRB, 1996).

20 Biological (Secondary) Treatment
Systems
The purpose of primary treatment is to remove suspended solids and
floating material. In many situations in some countries, pr imary treat-
ment with the resulting removal of approximately 40% to 60% of th e sus-
pended solids and 25% to 35% of BOD5, together with removal of
material from the wastewater, is adequate to meet the requirement of
the receiving water body. If primary treatment is not sufficien t to meet
the regulatory effluent standards, secondary treatment using a  biolog-
ical process is mostly used for further treatment due to its gr eater
removal efficiency and less cost than chemical coagulation. Sec ondary
treatment processes are intended to remove the soluble and colloidal
organics (BOD) which remain after primary treatment and to a chieve
further removal of suspended solids and, in some cases, also to r emoveWastewater Engineering 617nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Biological treat ment
processes provide similar biological activities to waste assi milation,
which would take place in the receiving waters, but in a r easonably
shorter time. Secondary treatment may remove more than 85% of BOD5
and suspended matter, but is really not effective for removing nu trients,
nonbiodegradable organics, heavy metals, and microorganisms.
Biological treatment systems are designed to maintain a larg e active
mass and a variety of microorganisms, principally bacteri a (and fungi,
protozoa, rotifers, algae, etc.), within the confined system under favor-
able environmental conditions, such as dissolved oxygen, nutr ient, etc.
Biological treatment processes are generally classified mainly as sus-
pended growth processes (activated sludge, Fig. 6.13), attached  (film)
growth processes (trickling filter and rotating biological con tactor,
RBC), and dual-process systems (combined). Other biological was te-
water treatment processes include the stabilization pond, aerat ed
lagoon, contaminant pond, oxidation ditch, high-purity oxyg en acti-
vated sludge, biological nitrification, denitrification, and  phosphorus
removal units.
In the suspended biological treatment process, under continuous
supply of air or oxygen, living aerobic microorganisms are mi xed thor-
oughly with the organics in the wastewater and use the organ ics as
food for their growth. As they grow, they clump or flocculate to for m an
active mass of microbes. This is so-called biologic floc or activ ated sludge.618 Chapter 6
Figure 6.13 Conventional activated sludge process.20.1 Cell growth
Each unicellular bacterium grows and, after reaching a cer tain size,
divides to produce two complete individuals by binary fission . The period
of time required for a growing population to double is called the gener-
ation time. With each generation, the total number increases a s the
power (exponent) of 2, i.e. 20, 21, 22, 23. . . The exponent of 2 correspon-
ding to any given number is the logarithm of that number to the base
2 (log2). Therefore, in an exponentially growing culture, the log2of the
number of cells increasing in proportion to time, is often referred to as
logarithmic growth.
The growth rate of microorganisms is affected by environmental con-
ditions, such as DO levels, temperature, nutrient levels, pH,  micro-bial
community, etc. Exponential growth does not normally continue for a
long period of time. A general growth pattern for fission-reproduction
bacteria in a batch culture is sketched in Fig. 6.14. They  are the lag
phase, the exponential (logarithmic) growth phase, the maximum
(stationary) phase, and the death phase.
When a small number of bacteria is inoculated into a fixed volu me of
vessel with culture medium, bacteria generally require time t o accli-
matize to their environmental condition. For this period of time, c alled
the lag phase, the bacterial density is almost unchanged. Under excessWastewater Engineering 619
Figure 6.14 Bacterial density with growth time.food supply, a rapid increase in number and mass of bacteria  occurs in
the log growth phase. During this maximum rate of growth a maxi-
mum rate of substrate removal occurs. Either some nutrients bec ome
exhausted, or toxic metabolic products may accumulate. Subs equently,
the growth rate decreases and then ceases. For this period, the c ell
number remains stationary at the stationary phase. As bac terial den-
sity increases and food runs short, cell growth will decline.  The total
mass of protoplasm exceeds the mass of viable cells, because bact eria
form resistant structures such as endospores.
In the endogenous growth period, the microorganisms compete for
the limiting substrate even to metabolize their own protoplasm. The
rate of metabolism decreases and starvation occurs. The rate of dea th
exceeds the rate of reproduction; cells also become old, die exponen-
tially, and lysis. Lysis can occur in which the nutri ents from the dead
cells diffuse out to furnish the remaining living cells as food.  The
results of cell lysis decrease both the population and the mass  of
microorganisms.
In the activated-sludge process, the balance of food to microorgani sms
is very important. Metabolism of the organic matter results i n an
increased mass of microorganisms in the process. The excess mass  of
microorganisms must be removed (waste sludge) from the system to
maintain a proper balance between mass of microorganisms and sub-
strate concentration in the aeration basin.
In both batch and continuous culture systems the growth ra te of bac-
terial cells can be expressed as

21 Activated-Sludge Process
The activated-sludge process was first used in Manchester, Eng land.
This process is perhaps the most widely used process for secondar y
treatment of wastewaters. Recently, the activated-sludge process has
been applied as a nitrification and denitrification process, and modified
with an anoxic and anaerobic section for phosphorus removal.
A basic suspended-growth (activated-sludge) process is depicted i n
Fig. 6.13. The wastewater continuously enters an aeration tank  where
previously developed biological flocs are brought into contact wi th the
organic material of the wastewater. Air or oxygen-enriched air i s con-
tinuously injected into the aeration tank as an oxygen source to keep the
system aerobic and the activated sludge in suspension. Appr oximately
8 m3of air is required for each m3of wastewater.
The microbes in the activated sludge consist of a gelatinous ma trix of
filamentous and unicellular bacteria which are fed on protozoa. The
predominant bacteria, such as Pseudomonas, utilize carbohydrate and
hydrocarbon wastes, whereas Bacillus, Flavobacterium, and Alcaligenes
consume protein wastes. When a new activated-sludge system is fi rst
started, it should be seeded with activated sludge from an exi sting oper-
ating plant. If seed sludge is not available, activated sl udge can be pre-
pared by simply continuously aerating, settling, and retu rning settled
solids to the wastewater for a few weeks (4 to 6 weeks) (Alessi et al, 1978;
Cheremisinoff, 1995).rg5mmSX

and energy source for cell growth and convert it to cell tissue,  water, and
oxidized products (mainly carbon dioxide, CO2). Some bacteria attack
the original complex substance to produce simple compounds as their
waste products. Other bacteria then use these waste products to produce
simpler compounds until the food is used up.
The mixture of wastewater and activated sludge in the aeration basis
is called mixed liquor. The biological mass (biomass) in the m ixed liquor
is called the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) or mixed liq uor
volatile suspended solids (MLVSS). The MLSS consists mostly of
microorganisms, nonbiodegradable suspended organic matter, an d other
inert suspended matter. The microorganisms in MLSS are composed of
70% to 90% organic and 10% to 30% inorganic matter (Okun, 194 9;
WEF and ASCE, 1996a). The types of bacterial cell vary, dependi ng on
the chemical characteristics of the influent waste-water tank conditions
and the specific characteristics of the microorganisms in th e flocs.
Microbial growth in the mixed liquor is maintained in the declining or
endogenous growth phase to insure good settling properties.
After a certain reaction time (4 to 8 h), the mixed liquor is d ischarged
from the aeration tank to a secondary sedimentation basin (settl ing
tank, clarifier) where the suspended solids are settled out from t he
treated wastewater by gravity. However, in a sequencing batch  reactor
(SBR), mixing and aeration in the aeration tank are stopped for  a time
interval to allow MLSS to settle and to decant the treated wast ewater;
thus a secondary clarifier is not needed in an SBR system. M ost con-
centrated biological settled sludge is recycled back to the aer ation tank
(so-called return activated sludge, RAS) to maintain a high population
of microorganisms to achieve rapid breakdown of the organics in the
wastewater. The volume of RAS is typically 20% to 30% of the wast ewater
flow. Usually more activated sludge is produced than return sludge.
The treated wastewater is commonly chlorinated and dechlorinated ,
then discharged to receiving water or to a tertiary treatment system
(Fig. 6.3). The preliminary, primary, and activated-sludge (b iological)
processes are included in the so-called secondary treatment proces s.
21.1 Aeration periods and BOD loadings
The empirical design of activated sludge is based on BOD loadi ng, food-
to-microorganism ratio (F/M), sludge age, and aeration period. Em pirical
design concepts are still acceptable. The Ten States Standard s states
that when activated-sludge process design calculations are n ot submit-
ted, the aeration tank capacities and permissible loadings for the sev-
eral adoptions of the processes shown in Table 6.11 are used as simple
design criteria. Those values apply to plants receiving diur nal load622 Chapter 6ratios of design peak hourly BOD5to design BOD5ranging from 2:1 to
4:1 (GLUMRB, 1996).
The aeration period is the retention time of the influent wastewater
flow in the aeration basin and is expressed in hours. It is computed from
the basin volume divided by the average daily flow excluding the return
sludge flow. For normal domestic sewage, the aeration period commonl y
ranges from 4 to 8 h with an air supply of 0.5 to 2.0 ft3/gal (3.7 to 15.0 m3/m3)
of wastewater. The return-activated sludge is expressed as a perc entage
of the wastewater influent of the aeration tank.
The organic (BOD5) loading on an aeration basin can be computed
using the BOD in the influent wastewater without including  the
return sludge flow. BOD loadings are expressed in terms of lb B OD
applied per day per 1000 ft3or [kg/(d /H11080m3)] of liquid volume in the
aeration basin and in terms of lb BOD applied per day per l b of mixed
liquid volatile suspended solids. The latter is called the food -to-
microorganism ratio.
BOD loadings per unit volume of aeration basin vary widely fr om 10
to more than 100 lb/1000 ft3(0.16 to 1.6 kg/(d /H11080m3)), while the aeration
periods correspondingly vary from 2.5 to 24 h (Clark et al. , 1977). The
relationship between the two parameters is directly related to t he BOD
concentration in the wastewater.
21.2 F/M ratio
The F/M ratio is used to express BOD loadings with regard to t he micro-
bial mass in the process. The value of the F/M ratio can be cal culatedWastewater Engineering 623

In Eqs. (6.62) and (6.63), some authors use mixed liquor volat ile sus-

MLSS and ranges from 0.75 to 0.85. Typically they are relat ed, for
design purposes, by MLVSS /H110050.80 /H11003MLSS. The use of MLVSS may
more closely approximate the total active biological mass in t he process.
The F/M ratio is also called the sludge loading ratio (SLR). The eq ua-

21.4 Process design concepts
The activated-sludge process has been used extensively in its ori ginal
basic form as well as in many modified forms. The process design  con-
siderations include hydraulic retention time (HRT) for reaction ki net-
ics; wastewater characteristics; environmental conditions, such as
temperature, pH, and alkalinity; and oxygen transfer.
Single or multiple aeration tanks are typically designed for completed
mixed flow, plug flow, or intermediate patterns and sized to prov ide an
HRT in the range of 0.5 to 24 h or more (WEF and ASCE, 1991a).Sh10.0 lb/d/1000 ft3324 h

6 h50.64 kg/sd#m3d626 Chapter 6In the past, designs of activated-sludge processes were generally
based on empirical parameters such as BOD5(simplified as BOD) load-
ings and aeration time (hydraulic retention time). In general,  short
HRTs were used for weak wastewaters and long HRTs for strong
wastewaters. Nowadays, the basic theory and design paramet ers for the
activated-sludge process are well developed and generally accepted .
The different design approaches were proposed by researchers on the
basis of the concepts of BOD5, mass balance, and microbial growth kinet-
ics (McKinney, 1962; Eckenfelder, 1966; Jenkins and Garris on, 1968;
Eckenfelder and Ford, 1970; Lawrence and McCarty, 1970; Rama nathan
and Gaudy, 1971; Gaudy and Kincannon, 1977; Schroeder, 1977;
Bidstrup and Grady, 1988).
Solution of the theoretical sophisticated design equations and c om-
puter models requires knowledge of microbial metabolism and growt h
kinetics, with pilot studies to obtain design information. A lternatives
to such studies are: (1) to assume certain wastewater charact eristics
and embark on a semiempirical design; and (2) to use an entir ely empir-
ical approach relying on regulatory recommended standards (WEF and
ASCE, 1991a).
21.5 Process mathematical modeling
For almost half a century, numerous design criteria utilizing  empirical
and rational parameters based on biological kinetic equations  have been
developed for suspended-growth systems. A survey of major consulting
firms in the United States indicates that the basic Lawrenc e and
McCarty (1970) model is most widely used. Details of its develop ment
can be obtained in the references (Lawrence and McCarty, 1970; G rady
and Lim, 1980; Qasim, 1985; Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 199 1). The basic
Lawrence and McCarty design equations used for sizing suspended -
growth systems are listed below.
Complete mix with recycle. The flow in a reactor is continuously stirred.
The contents of the reactor are mixed completely. It is called the
complete-mix reactor or continuous flow stirred tank reactor. Idea lly, it
is uniform throughout the tank. If the mass input rate into the reactor
remains constant, the content of the effluent remains constant. 
For a complete-mix system, the mean hydraulic retention time (HRT)

Microorganism and substrate mass balance. Because the term V/H11003MLSS
in Eq. (6.63) is a function of SRT or ucand not HRT or return sludge ratio,
the F/M ratio is also a function only of SRT. Therefore, operation of a n
activated-sludge plant at constant SRT will result in opera tion at a con-
stant F/M ratio.
The mass balance for the microorganisms in the entire activated  sludge
system is expressed as the rate of accumulation of the micro-organ isms
in the inflow plus net growth, minus that in the outflow. Ma thematically,
it is expressed as (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991)

The ranges of typical biological kinetic coefficients for activated -sludge
systems for domestic wastewater are given in Table 6.12. When t he
kinetic coefficients are available, Eqs. (6.78) and (6.80) can be used to
predict densities of effluent microorganisms and substrate (solub le

(1985)because many coefficients have to be known. In practice, the rela tion-
ship between specific substrate utilization rate, mean cell res idence
time, and the food to microorganism (F/M) ratio is commonly used for
activated-sludge process design and process control.
In Eq. (6.76), the term ( /H11002rsu/X) is called the specific substrate utiliza-
tion rate (or food to microorganisms ratio), U. Applying rsuin Eq. (6.77),
the specific substrate utilization rate can be computed by
(6.82)
(6.83)
The term U is substituted for the term (– rsu/X) in Eq. (6.76). The result-
ing equation becomes
(6.84)
The term 1/ucis the net specific growth rate and is directly related
to U, the specific substrate utilization rate.
In order to determine the specific substrate utilization rate, t he sub-
strate utilized and the biomass effective in the utilization mus t be given.
The substrate utilized can be computed from the difference between
the influent and the effluent BOD5or COD.
In the complete-mix activated-sludge process with recycle, wast e
sludge (cells) can be withdrawn from the tank or from the recycl ing
line. If waste sludge is withdrawn from the tank and the VS S in the

BOD5, MLSS, and degree of treatment. Aeration equipment must be able
to maintain a minimum of 2.0 mg/L of dissolved oxygen concentra tion
in the mixed liquor at all times and provide adequate mixin g. The
normal air requirements for all activated-sludge systems, excep t
extended aeration, are 1.1 kg of oxygen (93.5 m3of air) per kg BOD5or
1.1 lb of oxygen (1500 ft3of air) per lb BOD5, for design peak aeration
tank loading. That is 94 m3of air per kg of BOD5(1500 ft3/lb BOD5) at
standard conditions of temperature, pressure, and humidity. For the
extended aeration process, normal air requirements are 128 m3/kg BOD5
or 2050 ft3/lb BOD5(GLUMRB, 1996).

ventional activated-sludge systems amount to 31 to 56 m3/kg (500 to
900 ft3/lb) of BOD5removed for coarse bubble (nonporous) diffusers
and 25 to 37 m3/kg (400 to 600 ft3/lb) BOD5removal for fine bubble
(porous) diffusers. For lower F/M ratios, endogenous respiration, nitr i-
fication, and prolonged aeration increase air use to 75 to 112 m3/kg
(1200 to 1800 ft3/lb) of BOD5removal. In practice, air requirements
range from 3.75 to 15.0 m3air/m3water (0.5 to 2 ft3/gal) with a typical
value of 7.5 m3/m3or 1.0 ft3/gal (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991).

The total depth of the secondary clarifier is the sum of the requir ed depths
of the clear water zone, the solids thickening zone, and the sludg e storage
zone. In order to estimate the depth of the thickening zone, it is a ssumed that,
under normal conditions, the mass of solids retained in the sec ondary clari-
fier is 30% of the mass of solids in the aeration basin, and th at the average
concentration of solids in the sludge zone is 7000 mg/L (Metcalf a nd Eddy, Inc.
1991). The system has 4 aeration tanks and 2 clarifiers.

Plug-ﬂow with recycle. Conventional and many modified activated-
sludge processes are designed approximately like the plug-flow mod el
(Fig. 6.18). In a time plug-flow reactor, all fluid particles entering the
reactor stay in the reactor for an equal amount of time and pas s through
the reactor in sequence. Those that enter first leave first. It is  assumed
that there is no mixing in the lateral direction. In pract ice, a time plug-
flow reactor is difficult to obtain because of longitudinal disp ersion. In
a real plug-flow, some particles may make more passes through t he
reactor as a result of recycling.
The mathematical modeling for the plug-flow process is difficult. The
most accepted useful kinetic model of the plug-flow reactor for the ac tivated-
sludge process was developed by Lawrence and McCarty (1969). TheyHRT 5 5888 m3 3  24 h/d

21.6 Operation and control of 
activated-sludge processes
The aeration basin is the heart of the activated-sludge process. Process
operation and system controls usually need well trained operator s, with
operational parameters such as air or oxygen supply, F/M rat io, and
mass balance to return activated sludge. However, some nontheoreti cal
indexes such as sludge volume index, sludge density index, s ludge set-
tleability, and sludge age are widely used and valuable tool s for the
daily process of operation and control.
Sludge volume index. The sludge volume index (SVI) is the volume of mL
occupied by 1 g of suspension after 30 min of settling. Althoug h SVI is not
theoretically supported, experience has shown it is useful in r outine process
control. SVI typically is used to monitor the settling char acteristics of acti-
vated sludge and can impact on return sludge rate and MLSS .Si 5  S0 1  aS

Ks 1  SSVI is calculated from the laboratory test results of the susp ended
solids concentration of a well mixed sample of the suspension and  the
30-min settled sludge volume. The sludge volume is measured by fi ll-
ing a 1-liter graduated cylinder to the 1.0-liter mark, all owing settling
for 30 min, and then reading the volume of settled solids. The mi xed
liquid suspended solids is determined by filtering, drying,  and weigh-
ing a sample of the mixed liquor as stated in the previous sec tion in this
chapter. The value of SVI can be calculated by the following form ula
(Standard Methods—APHA et al., 1998).

SV /H11005settled sludge volume, mL/L
MLSS /H11005mixed liquor suspended solids, mg/L
1000 /H11005milligrams per gram, mg/g
Typical values of SVI for domestic activated-sludge plants oper ating
with an MLSS concentration of 2000 to 3500 mg/L range from 80 to 150
mL/g (Davis and Cornwell, 1991).
The SVI is an important factor in process design. It limits  the tank
MLSS concentration and return sludge rate.
Sludge density index. Sludge density index is used in a way similar to
the sludge volume index to indicate the settleability of a slud ge in a sec-
ondary clarifier or effluent. The weight in grams of 1 mL of sludge,  after
settling for 30 min, is calculated as
SDI /H11005100/SVI (6.103)
where SDI /H11005sludge density index, g/mL
SVI /H11005sludge volume index, mL/g
A sludge with good settling characteristics has an SDI of b etween 1.0
and 2.0, whereas an SDI of 0.5 indicates a bulky or nonsett leable sludge
(Cheremisinoff, 1995).
Return activated sludge. Return activated sludge is the settled acti-
vated sludge that is collected in the secondary clarifier and  returned to
the aeration tank to mix with the influent wastewater.SVI5Wet settled sludge, mL/L
Dry sludge solid, mg/LSVI5SV31000 mg/g
MLSS650 Chapter 6The efficiency of the activated-sludge process is measured by BOD
removal, which is directly related to the volatile activated-s ludge solids
in the aeration basin. The purpose of sludge return is to maint ain a suf-
ficient concentration of activated sludge in the aeration tank.  The RAS
makes it possible for the microorganisms to be in the treatment system
longer than the flowing wastewater. The RAS flow for a conventional
activated-sludge system is usually 20% to 40% of the tank infl uent flow
rate. Table 6.13 lists typical ranges of RAS flow rates for s ome of the acti-
vated-sludge processes. Sludge volume index (Eq. (6.102)) is empir ical and
is used to control the rate of return sludge. The minimum percent age of
return activated sludge is related to SVI and the solids con centration in
the mixed liquor and is expressed as (Clark and Viessman, 1 966)

Step 4. Determine tank dimensions
Use eight tanks with depth of 5 m, width of 7 m, and length  of 15 m, as in
Example 1.
Return activated-sludge ﬂow rate. The RAS, at a constant flow rate, is
independent of the tank influent flow rate and changes the MLSS i n the
tank continuously. The MLSS concentration will be at a maxim um
during low influent flows and at a minimum during peak in fluent flows.
The secondary clarifier must constantly change the depth of the sludge
blanket. To maintain a good F/M ratio, a programmed control d evice
should be installed to maintain a constant percent of RAS flow  to the
tank influent flow. However, any change in the activated-sludge qual-
ity will require a different RAS flow rate because of the changin g set-
tling characteristics of the sludge.
The relationship between maximum RAS concentration ( Xr) and SVI can
be derived from Eq. (6.69) using settled sludge volume SV /H110051000 mL/L.

Sludge settleability. Another method of calculating RAS flow rate is
based on the settleability approach. The settleability is defin ed as the
percentage of volume occupied by the sludge after settling for 30 m in.
The RAS flow rate is related to settled sludge volume as follows:
1000 Qr/H11005(SV)( Q/H11001Qr) (6.106)
or
(6.107)

Q/H11005flow of tank influent, m3/s or Mgal/d
SV /H11005 settled sludge volume (30-min settling), mL/L
Example: In practice, the operator checks the VSS concentration in the return
activated sludge at least once every shift and makes the appr opriate RAS flow
rate adjustment. The previous operator recorded that RAS flow was  44 gal/min
(240 m3/d) with the VSS in RAS of 5800 mg/L. The on-duty operator determ ines
the VSS in RAS as 5500 mg/L. What should the RAS flow rate be adjusted to?
solution: Since the VSS in the RAS is decreasing, the sludge wasting  flow
should be increased proportionally to waste the amount of VSS.

Aeration tank mass balance. In practice, the maximum RAS pumping
capacity is commonly designed as 100% of design average flow (us e 150%
for oxidation ditch). The required RAS pumpage can be determined by aer-
ation tank mass balance. Assume new cell growth is negligi ble and there
is no accumulation in the aeration tank. Also, the solids c oncentration in
the tank influent is negligible compared to the MLSS, X, in the tank. Thus
mass of inflow is equal to that of outflow. This can be expressed a s

Waste activated sludge. The excess of activated sludge generated from
the secondary clarifier must be wasted, usually from the retur n sludge
line. The waste activated sludge (WAS) is discharged to either the pri-
mary clarifiers or to sludge thickeners. Withdrawing mixed liquor
directly from the aeration basin or from the basin effluent line i s an
alternative method of sludge wasting. The amount of WAS removed
affects mixed liquor settleability, oxygen consumption, growth rate of the
microorganisms, nutrient quantities, input occurrence of foami ng and
sludge bulking effluent quality, and possibility of nitrific ation.
The purpose of WAS is to maintain a given food-to-microorganisms
ratio or mean cell residence time of the system. It should remove j ust
the amount of microorganisms that grow in excess of the microorga nism
death rate.
Sludge wasting can be accomplished on an intermittent or con tinu-
ous basis. The parameters used for control guidelines are F/M rat io,
mean cell residence time, MLVSS, and sludge age.
Secondary clariﬁer mass balance. Although it assumes the sludge blan-
ket is level in the secondary clarifier, the secondary clarifier  mass bal-
ance approach is a useful tool to determine the RAS flow rate. The
calculations are based on the secondary clarifier (Fig. 6.15). Assuming
the sludge blanket in the clarifier is not changed and the effl uent sus-
pended solids are negligible, the SS entering the clarifier is equal to the
SS leaving. The relationship can be written as
(Q /H11001Qwr) (MLSS) /H11005Qwa(WAS) /H11001Qwr(RAS)

Sludge age. Sludge age is a measure of the length of time a particle of
suspended solids has been retained in the activated-sludge proc ess. It
is also referred to as mean cell residence time and is an operati onal
parameter related to the F/M ratio. Sludge age is defined as tha t of theQwr5QsMLSSd2QwasWASd

Note : Equations (6.112) and (6.72) are the same.
Sludge age can also be expressed in terms of the volatile portion of
suspended solids, which is more representative of biological mas s.
Solids retention time in an activated-sludge system is measur ed in
days, whereas the liquid aeration period is in hours. In mos t activated-
sludge plants, sludge age ranges from 3 to 8 days (US EPA, 1979). The
liquid aeration periods vary from 3 to 30 h (Hammer, 1986). Wa stewater
passes through the aeration tank only once and rather quickl y, whereas
the resultant biological growths and extracted waste organic s are
repeatedly recycled from the secondary clarifier back to the aerat ion
basin.
Example 1: An activated-sludge system has an influent flow of 22,700 m3/d
(6.0 Mgal/d) with suspended solids of 96 mg/L. Three aeration ta nks hold
1500 m3(53,000 ft3) each with MLSS of 2600 mg/L. Calculate the sludge age

Sludge bulking. A desirable activated sludge is one which settles rap-
idly leaving a clear, odorless, and stable supernatant. The efficiency of
treatment achieved in an activated-sludge process depends direc tly on
settleability of the sludge in the secondary clarifier. At tim es, poorlyWastewater Engineering 663
settling sludge and foam formation cause the most common operation al
problems of the activated-sludge process. Sludge with poorly flocc ulated
(pin) particles or buoyant filamentous growths increases its v olume and
does not settle well in the clarifier. Light sludge in the clar ifier then spills
over the weirs and is carried away in the effluent. The concentra tions
of BOD and suspended solids increase in the effluent. This phenomen on
is called sludge bulking and it frequently occurs unexpected ly.
Sludge bulking is caused by: (1) the growth of filamentous orga nisms,
or organisms that can grow in filamentous form under adverse c onditions,
and (2) adverse environmental conditions such as excessive flow, insuf-
ficient aeration, short circulating of aeration tanks, lack of nutrients,
septic influent, presence of toxic substances, or overloading. Nocardia
amarae, Microthrix parvicella, N. amarae-like organisms, N. pinensis -like
organisms, and type 0092 were most commonly found in foam and bulk
sludge. Nocardia growth is supported by high sludge age, low F/M ratio,
and higher rather than lower wastewater temperature (Droste, 19 97).
Fungi are mostly filamentous microorganisms. Some bacteria suc h as
Beggiatoa, Thiotrix, and Leucothrix grow in filamentous sheaths.
There are no certain rules for prevention and control of sludge bulk ing.
If bulking develops, the solution is to determine the cause and then either
eliminate or correct it or take compensatory steps in operation c ontrol.
Some remedial steps may be taken, e.g. changing parameters su ch as
wastewater characteristics, BOD loading, dissolved oxygen c oncentra-
tion in the aeration basin, return sludge pumping rate, mi croscopic exam-
ination of organisms (check for protozoa, rotifers, filamentous bacter ia,
and nematodes) in clarifiers’ and other operating units. Chlori nation of
RAS in the range of 2 to 3 mg/L of chlorine per 1000 mg/L of MLVS S is
suggested (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991). Hydroperoxide also can  be used
as an oxidant. Reducing the suspended solids in the aeration  basin,
increasing air supply rate, or increasing the BOD loading  (which may
depress filamentous growth), and addition of lime to the mixed li quor for
pH adjustment are the remedial methods which have been used. The
F/M ratio should be maintained at 0.5 to 0.2.
21.7 Modiﬁed activated-sludge processes
Numerous modifications (variations) of the conventional activated-s ludge
plug flow process have been developed and proved effective for removal
of BOD and/or nitrification. The modified processes include tapered  aer-
ation, step-feed aeration, complete-mix extended aeration, modified aer-
ation, high-rate aeration, contact stabilization, Hatfield proc ess, Kraus
process, sequencing batch reactor, high-purity oxygen, oxidat ion ditch,
deep shaft reactor, single-stage nitrification, and separate st age nitrifi-
cation. Except for a few processes, most modified processes basical ly
differ on the range of the F/M ratio maintained and in the introd uction664 Chapter 6
locations for air supply and wastewater. The design parameters  and
operational characteristics for various activated-sludge proces ses are
presented elsewhere (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991, WEF and ASCE,
1991a). Standard and modified processes are discussed below.
Conventional process. The earliest activated-sludge process was con-
tained in long narrow tanks with air for oxygen supply and  mixing
through diffusers at the bottom of the aeration tank. A conventiona l
plug-flow process consists of a primary clarifier, an aeration tank with
air diffusers for mixing the wastewater and the activated slu dge in the
presence of dissolved oxygen, a secondary settling basin for solid s
removal, and a sludge-return line from the clarifier bottom to th e influ-
ent of the aeration tank (Fig. 6.18). The return activated sludg e is mixed
with the incoming wastewater and passes through the aeration  tank in
a plug-flow fashion. High organics concentration and high mic robial
solids at the head end of the aeration tank lead to a high oxyg en demand.
The conventional process is more susceptible to upset from shock loa ds
and toxic materials, and is used for low-strength domestic wa stewaters.
The conventional process is designed to treat 0.3 to 0.6 kg BOD5
applied/(m3/H11080d) (20 to 40 lb/(1000 cu /H11080 ft /H11080d)) in the United States with
MLSS of 1500 to 3000 mg/L. The aeration period ranges between 4 an d
8 h with return activated-sludge flow ratios of 0.27 to 0.75.  The cell res-
idence time (uc) is 5 to 15 days and the F/M ratio is 0.2 to 0.4 per day.
The process generally removed 85% to 95% of BOD5and produces highly
nitrified effluent (WEF and ASCE, 1991a).

are shown as average values as below.

Tapered aeration. Since oxygen demands decrease along the length
of the plug-flow reactor, the tapered aeration process attempts to m atch
the oxygen supply to demand by adding more air at the influen t end of
the aeration tank than at the effluent end (Fig. 6.19). This is obtained
by varying the diffuser spacing. The best results can be ach ieved by
supplying 55% to 75% of the total air supply to the first hal f of the tank
(Al-Layla et al., 1980). Advantages of tapered aeration are those ofTS5s5132418d mg/L3100%

tional control, and inhibiting nitrification if desired.
Step aeration. In step (step-feed) aeration activated-sludge systems,
the incoming wastewater is distributed to the aeration tank at a number
(3 to 4) of points along the plug-flow tank, and the return acti vated
sludge is introduced at the head of the aeration tank. The organ ic load
is distributed over the length of the tank (Fig. 6.20), thus av oiding the

locally lengthy oxygen demand encountered in conventional and t apered
aeration. This process leads to shorter retention time and lower a cti-
vated-sludge concentrations in the mixed liquor. The process is used for
general application.
The BOD5loading rates are higher, 0.6 to 1.0 kg/(m3/H11080d) (40 to 60 lb/
(1000 ft3/H11080d)) and MLSS are also higher, 2000 to 3500 mg/L. The hydrauli c
retention time is shorter by 3 to 5 h. The following parameters for  the step
aeration process are the same as for a conventional plant: uc/H110055 to 15 days;
F/M /H110050.2 to 0.4 per day; Qr/Q /H110050.25 to 0.75; and BOD removal /H1100585%
to 95%.
This process, with treatment efficiency practically equivalent  to that of
the conventional activated-sludge process, can be carried out i n about one-
half of the aeration time while maintaining the sludge age wit hin proper
limits of 3 to 4 days. The construction cost and the area requ ired for step
aeration are less than for the conventional process. Operational costs are
about the same for both the conventional and step aeration process es.
Complete-mix process. Complete-mix processes disperse the influent
wastewater and return activated sludge uniformly throughout the aer-
ation tank. The shape of the reactor is not important. With ca reful selec-
tion of aeration and mixing equipment, the process should provi de
practically complete mixing. The oxygen demand is also uniform  through-
out the tank (Fig. 6.21).
Complete-mix processes protect against hydraulic and organic shock
loadings commonly encountered in the process. Toxic materials a re usually
diluted below their threshold concentration. The treatment efficienc y of the
complete-mix process is comparable to that of the conventional proc ess
(85% to 95% BOD removal). The complete-mix process has increased in pop-
ularity for the treatment of industrial wastewaters. The process  is used for
general application, but is susceptible to filamentous growth s.
Figure 6.21 Complete-mix activated-sludge process.Wastewater Engineering 669
The design criteria for the complete-mix process are: 0.45 to 2.0 kg
BOD5/(m3/H11080d) (28 to 125 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)), F/M /H110050.2 to 0.6 per day, uc/H110055
to 15 days, MLSS /H110052500 to 6500 mg/L, HRT /H110053 to 5 h, Qr/Q /H110050.25 to
1.0 (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991). A design example for the com plete-mix
activated-sludge process is given in the section on mathematic al modeling.
Extended aeration. The extended aeration process is a complete-mix
activated-sludge process operated at a long HRT ( u/H1100516 to 24 or 36 h)
and a high cell residence time (sludge age uc/H1100520 to 30 days). The
process may be characterized as having a long aeration time, high MLSS
concentration, high RAS pumping rate, and low sludge wast age.
Extended aeration is typically used in small plants for pl ant flows of
3780 m3/d (1 Mgal/d) or less, such as schools, villages, subdivis ions,
trailer parks, etc. Many extended aeration plants are prefabr icated
units or so-called package plants (Guo et al., 1981). The process is flex-
ible and is also used where nitrification is required.
The influent wastewater may be only screened and degritted withou t
primary sedimentation. The extended aeration system allows the p lant
to operate effectively over widely varying flows and organic loadin gs
without upset. Organic loading rates are designed as 0.1 t o 0.4 kg
BOD5/(m3/H11080d) (6 to 25 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)). The other design parameters are:
MLSS /H110051500 to 5000 mg/L, and Qr/Q/H110050.5 to 1.50 (WEF and ASCE,
1992). The extended aeration process has a food to microorganisms r atio
(F/M) from 0.05 to 0.20 kg BOD5per kg MLSS-day. It is developed to
minimize waste activated sludge production by providing a l arge endoge-
nous decay of the sludge mass. The process is so designed that t he mass
of cells synthesized per day equals the mass of cells endogenous dec ayed
per day. Therefore there is theoretically no cell mass production.
The extended aeration process has a food to microorganism ratio from
0.05 to 0.20 kg BOD5per kg MLSS pre day. It is developed to minimize
waste activated sludge production by providing a large endog enous
decay of the sludge mass. The process is so designed that the ma ss of
cells synthesized per day equals the mass of cells endogenous deca y per
day. Therefore there is theoretically no cell mass products.
Secondary clarifiers must be designed to handle the variations  in
hydraulic loadings and high MLSS concentration associated with the
system. The overflow rates range from 8 to 24 m3/(m2/H11080d) (200 to 600 gal/
(d /H11080ft2)) and with long retention time. Sludge may be returned to the
aeration tank through a slot opening or by an air-lift pump (Hammer,
1986). Floating materials and used sludge on the surface of the clari-
fier can be removed by a skimming device.
Since the process maintains a high concentration of microorgan isms
in the aeration tank for a long time, endogenous respiration pla ys a
major role in activated sludge quality. More dissolved oxygen (DO) is670 Chapter 6
required. Nitrification may occur in the system. The volatile portion
of the sludge remaining is not degraded at the same rate as nor mal
activated sludge and thereby results in a lower BOD exertion rate. The
effluent of extended aeration often meets BOD standards (75% to
95% removal) but does not meet TSS standards due to continuous
loss of pinpoint flocs (rising sludge). To overcome TSS loss, periodi c
sludge wasting is required. It has been suggested that the average
MLSS concentration should not fall below 2000 mg/L (Guo et al.,
1981). In cold climates, heat lost in the extended aeration sy stem
must be controlled. However, Guo et al. (1981) pointed out that insuf-
ficient staff, inadequate training, or both are the most common causes
of poor performance of the extended aeration process, especially in
small package plants.
Example: An extended aeration activated-sludge plant without sludge wa st-
ing has a BOD5loading rate of 0.29 kg/(m3/H11080d) (18 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)) with aer-
ation for 24 h. The daily MLSS buildup in the aeration basin  is measured as
55 mg/L. Determine the percentage of the influent BOD5that is converted to
MLSS and retained in the basin. Estimate the time required t o increase the
MLSS from 1500 to 5500 mg/L (this range is in the design cri teria).

Short-term aeration. Short-term aeration or modified aeration is a plug-
flow pretreatment process. The process has extremely high loading rates
of 1.2 to 2.4 kg BOD5/(m3/H11080d) (75 to 150 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)) with an F/M
ratio of 1.5 to 5.0 kg BOD/d per kg MLVSS. The volumetric loa dings are
low, ranging from 200 to 1000 mg/L of MLSS. The HRT ( u) are 1.5 to
3 h; sludge age uc/H110050.2 to 0.5 days; and Qr/Q /H110050.05 to 0.25. Short
retention time and low sludge age lead to a poor effluent quality and rel-
atively high solids production. This process can be used as the first
stage of a two-stage nitrification process and is used for an in termediate
degree of treatment.
The short-term aeration process offers cost savings of construction b y
increasing BOD loading rates and reducing the required volu me of aer-
ation tank. The process produces a relatively large amount of ML VSS
which may cause disposal problems. If the sludge is allowed to remain
in the system, the BOD5removal efficiency ranges from 50% to 75%
(Chermisinoff, 1995).
High rate aeration. For some cases it may not be necessary to treat the
wastewater to the high degree of effluent quality achieved by conven -
tional or other improved processes. High rate aeration is an app lication
of the complete-mix activated-sludge process with a short HRT ( u/H110050.5
to 2.0 h), a short sludge age ( uc/H110055 to 10 days), a high sludge recycle
ratio (Qr/Q /H110051.0 to 5.0), and an organic loading rate of 1.6 to 16 kg
BOD5/m3/H11080d (100 to 1000 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)). The MLSS concentration in the
aeration tanks ranges from 4000 to 10,000 mg/L, and the F/M ratios are
0.4 to 1.5 per day which are higher than those for the convent ional process
(WEF and ASCE, 1991a). The process reduces the cost of construction .
Complete-mix aeration and the hydraulic thickening action of a  rapid
sludge return are mandatory to offset decreased sludge settleabili ty of
the biological flocs (Bruce and Merkens, 1973). It is designed to main-
tain the biomass in the growth phase. Poor performance of a high-r ate
aeration system is usually due to insufficient aeration capac ity to supply
adequate dissolved oxygen during peak loading periods. Subsequ ently,
suspended flocs are carried over to the secondary clarifier effluent.  Also,
inadequate RAS flow rates and high solids flux may cause sl udge to be
washed out through the clarifier.
Well-operated high-rate aeration processes can produce effluent qual-
ity comparable to that of a conventional plant. A BOD5removal efficiency
of 75% to 90% can be achieved. A high-rate single-stage aeration sy stem
can be used for general application and to partially remove ca rbonaceous
BOD5at the first stage of a two-stage nitrification system.
Contact stabilization. The contact stabilization process or biosorption was
developed to take advantage of the adsorptive properties of activated
sludge. A schematic flow diagram of the contact stabilization system is672 Chapter 6
shown in Fig. 6.22. Returned sludge which has been aerated (3  to 6 h) in
the stabilization basin (44,000 to 10,000 mg/L of MLSS) for sta bilization
of previously adsorbed organic matter is mixed with influent w astewater
for a brief period (20 to 40 min). BOD removal from wastewater tak es
place on immediate contact with a high concentration (1000 t o 4000 mg/L
of MLSS in contact tank) of stabilized activated sludge. This a dsorbs sus-
pended and colloidal solids quickly, but not dissolved organ ic matter.
Following the contact period, the activated sludge is separated  from the
mixed liquor in a clarifier. A small portion of the sludge is wasted while
the remainder flows to the stabilization tank. During the sta bilization
period, the stored organic matter is utilized for cell growth an d respira-
tion; as a result, it becomes stabilized or activated again,  then is recycled.
Contact stabilization was initially used to provide a part ial treat-
ment (60% to 75% BOD5removal) at larger coastal plants. It has been
designed for package systems for industrial waste application  and is
used for expansion of existing systems and package plants.
The process is a plug-flow system and is characterized by relat ively
short retention times (0.5 to 3 h) with very high organic load ing of 1.0
to 1.2 kg BOD5/(m3/H11080d) (62 to 75 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)). Compared to the con-
ventional activated-sludge process, oxygen requirements are lower but
waste sludge quantities are higher. Designs may either incl ude or omit
primary treatment. In general, the process has a BOD5removal effi-
ciency of 80% to 90% (WEF and ASCE, 1992). This process can be effec-
tively used as the first stage of a multiple system.
The disadvantages of the process are:
1. Sensitive to variations in organic and hydraulic loadin gs due to its
short HRT and low MLSS concentration;
2. Neither as economical nor as efficient in BOD removal.
These shortcomings may result in noncompliance with effluent qua lity
standards.
Figure 6.22 Schematic flow diagram of contact stabilization process.Wastewater Engineering 673
Hatﬁeld process. The Hatfield process (developed by William Hatfield
of the Decatur Sanitary District, Illinois) differs from the con tact sta-
bilization process. The process aerates anaerobic digester superna tant
or sludge (rich in nitrogen), with (all) return sludge from the secondary
clarifier then fed back to the aeration tank (Fig. 6.23). The proc ess is
used to treat wastewater with low nitrogen levels and high ca rbonaceous
material levels, such as some industrial wastewaters. Supp lying an aer-
obic digester effluent to the aeration tank fortifies the MLSS with amino
acids and other nitrogenous substances.
The Hatfield process has the advantage, as in the contact stab ilization
system, of being able to maintain a large amount of microorgani sms
under aeration in a relatively small aeration tank. Heavier t ypes of solids
are produced in the aeration tank, which can prevent bulkin g problems.
However, the Hatfield process is not widely used in the United Sta tes.
Kraus process. The conventional activated-sludge plant at Peoria,
Illinois, was found to be operated improperly due to sludge bulk ing
because of a heavy load of carbohydrates from breweries, packing
houses, and paper mills. Kraus (1955) improved the process per formance
by aerating the mixture of anaerobic digester supernatant and  a small
portion of the return activated sludge in a separate aeration b asin
(Fig. 6.23). Some portion of the return activated sludge bypasses the
sludge aeration basin and is introduced directly to the mix ed liquor aer-
ation tank. This is a modification of the Hatfield process and l ies between
the conventional system and the Hatfield process.
Figure 6.23 Schematic flow diagram of Hatfield activated-sludge process and Kraus p rocess.674 Chapter 6
The MLSS become highly nitrified materials which are brought i nto
contact with the influent wastewater in the aeration tank. Th e BOD5
loading is 1.8 kg/(m3/H11080d) (112 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)) with 90% removal.
The specific gravity of the digester solids is greater than tha t of the
activated sludge, and the settling characteristics are th us improved.
Since high dissolved oxygen is required for the Kraus process, in order
to cope with high oxygen demand, Kraus applied a dual syst em in the
sludge reaeration basin in which there was a combination of c oarse-
bubble aeration at the top of the basin and fine-bubble aeration at the
bottom of the basin. The process is used for high-strength wastewa ters
with low nitrogen levels.
The design criteria for the Kraus process are: BOD5loading /H110050.6 to 1.6
kg/(m3/H11080d) (40 to 100 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)), F/M /H110050.3 to 0.8 per day, MLSS /H11005
2000 to 3000 mg/L, HRT /H110054 to 8 days, Qr/Q /H110050.5 to 1.0.
Sequencing batch reactor. A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) is a peri-
odically operated, fill-and-draw activated-sludge system. The un it
process used in the SBR and the conventional activated-sludge system
are essentially the same. Both have aeration and sedimentation.  In the
activated-sludge plant, the processes are taking place simul taneously
in separate basins, whereas in the SBR the aeration and cla rification
processes are carried out sequentially in the same basin. The s ystem is
used for small communities with limited land.
Each reactor in an SBR system has five discrete periods (steps ) in each
cycle: fill, react (aeration), settle (sedimentation/clarification ), draw
(decant), and idle (Herzbrun et al., 1985). Biological activities are
initiated as the influent wastewater fills the basin. Durin g the fill and
react period, the wastewater is aerated in the same manner as in a
conventional activated-sludge system. After the reaction step, t he mixed
liquor suspended solids are allowed to settle in the same basin . The
treated supernatant is withdrawn during the draw period. The idle
period, the time between the draw and fill, may be zero or some cert ain
period (days). The process is flexible and can remove nitrogen and phos-
phorus. Since the development of SBR technology in the early 1960 s, a
number of process modifications have been made to achieve specific
treatment objectives.
In an SBR operation, sludge wasting is an important task  relating to
system performance. It usually takes place during the settle and idle
phases. There is no return activated-sludge system in the SBR system.
High-purity oxygen system. The pure oxygen activated-sludge process
was first studied by Okun in 1947 (Okun, 1949). The process  achieved
commercial status in the 1970s. Currently a large number of high-purity
oxygen activated-sludge plants have been put into operation.Wastewater Engineering 675
The process has been developed in an attempt to match oxygen supp ly
and oxygen demand and to use a high-rate process through main te-
nance of high concentrations of biomass. The major components of the
process are an oxygen generator, using high-purity oxygen in l ieu of
air, a specially compartmented aeration basin, a clarifier,  pumps for
recirculating activated sludge, and sludge disposal facil ities. Oxygen is
generated by manufacturing liquid oxygen cryogenically on-sit e for large
plants and by pressure swing adsorption for small plants.  Standard
cryogenic air separation involves liquefaction of air followed by fractional
distillation to separate the major components of oxygen and nitr ogen.
The aeration basin is divided into compartments by baffles and  is
covered with a gastight cover. An agitator is included in each compart-
ment (Fig. 6.24). High-purity oxygen is fed concurrently with w aste-
water flow. Influent wastewater, return activated sludge, and  oxygen gas
under slight pressure are introduced to the first compartment.  A dis-
solved oxygen concentration of 4 to 10 mg/L is normally maintai ned in
the mixed liquor. Successive aeration compartments are connected  to
each other through submerged ports. Exhausted waste gas is a  mixture
of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and approximately 10% of oxygen supp lied
and vented from the last stage of the system. Effluent mixed liqu or is
then settled in a secondary clarifier. Settled activated slud ge is recir-
culated to the aeration basin, with some wasted. The process is  used for
general application with high-strength wastes with limited  space.
Design parameters of high-purity oxygen systems are: BOD5loading /H11005
1.6 to 3.2 kg/(m3/H11080d) (100 to 200 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)), MLSS /H110053000 to 8000
mg/L, F/M /H110050.25 to 1.0 per day, HRT /H110051 to 3 days, uc/H110058 to 20 days,
and Qr/Q /H110050.25 to 0.5. The BOD5removal efficiency for the process is
85% to 95% (WEF and ASCE, 1992).

Advantages of the high-purity oxygen activated-sludge process i nclude
higher oxygen transfer gradient and rates, smaller reaction c hambers,
improved biokinetics, the ability to treat high-strength solu ble waste-
water, greater tolerance for peak organic loadings, reduced energy
requirements, reduction in bulking problems, a better settlin g sludge
(1% to 2% solids), and effective odor control.
In a comparison of air and pure oxygen systems, researchers rep orted
little or no significant difference in carbonaceous BOD5 removal kinet-
ics with DO concentration about 1 to 2 mg/L. Lower pH values (6 .0 to 6.5)
occur with high-purity oxygen and loss of alkalinity, with  nitrate pro-
duction. Covered aeration tanks have a potential explosion possi bility.
Example: The high-purity oxygen activated-sludge process is selected for
treating a high-strength industrial wastewater due to limi ted space.

Oxidation ditch. The oxidation ditch process was developed by Pasveer
(1960) in Holland and is a modification of the conventional acti vated-
sludge plug-flow process. The system is especially applicable t o small
communities needing low-cost treatment. The oxidation ditch is t ypically
an extended aeration mode. It consists typically of a single or  closed-loop
elongated oval channel with a liquid depth of 1.2 to 1.8 m (4  to 6 ft) and
45-degree sloping sidewalls (Fig. 6.25).
Wastewater is given preliminary treatment such as screening , com-
minution, or grit removal (usually without primary treatmen t). The
wastewater is introduced into the ditch and is aerated usin g mechanical
aerator(s) (Kessener brush) which are mounted across the channel for
an extended period of time with long HRT of 8 to 36 h (typically 2 4 h)
and SRT (solids residence time) of 20 to 30 days (WEF and ASCE, 1 992).uc5VX

The aerators provide mixing and circulation in the ditch, a nd oxygen
transfer. The mechanical brush operates in the 60 to 110 rev/m in range
and keeps the liquid in motion at velocities from 0.24 to 0.37  m/s (0.8 to
1.2 ft/s), sufficient to prevent deposition of solids. A large fract ion of the
required oxygen is supplied by transfer through the free surface of the
wastewater rather than by aeration. As the wastewater passes  the aer-
ator, the DO concentration rises and then falls while the was tewater
traverses the circuit.
The BOD5loading in the oxidation ditch is usually as low as 0.08  to
0.48 kg/(m3/H11080d) (5 to 30 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080d)). The F/M ratios are 0.05 to 0.30
per day. The MLSS are in the range of 1500 to 5000 mg/L. The act ivated
sludge in the oxidation ditch removes the organic matter and converts
it to cell protoplasm. This biomass will be degraded for long s olids res-
idence time.
Separate or interchannel clarifiers are used for separating and  return-
ing MLSS to the ditch. Recommendations for unit size and power
requirements are available from equipment manufacturers.
The oxidation ditch is popular because of its high BOD5removal effi-
ciency (85% to 95%) and easy operation. Nitrification occurs als o in the
system. The oxidation ditch is a flexible process and is used for small
communities where large land area is available. However, the su rface

aerators may become iced during the winter months. Electrical  heating
must be installed at the critical area. During cold weath er the opera-
tion must prevent loss of efficiency, mechanical damage, and da nger to
the operators.

Deep shaft reactor. A new variation of the activated-sludge process,
developed in England, the deep shaft reactor is used where costs of land
are high. It is used for general application with high-stren gth wastes.
There are a number of installations in Japan. It has been mar keted in
the United States and Canada.
The deep shaft reactor consists of a vertical shaft about 120 to 150 m
(400 to 500 ft) deep, utilizing a U-tube aeration system (Fig. 6. 26). The 520 days30.6s22022.3d mg/L

shaft replaces the primary clarifiers and aeration tanks. Th e deep
shaft is lined with a steel shell and fitted with a concentr ic pipe to form
an annular reactor. Wastewater, return activated sludge, a nd air is
forced down the center of the shaft and allowed to rise upward thr ough
the annulus (riser). The higher pressures obtained in the deep sh aft
improve the oxygen transfer rate and more oxygen can be dissolved,
with beneficial effects on substrate utilization. DO concentrati on can
range from 25 to 60 mg/L (Droste, 1997). Microbial reaction rat es are
not affected by the high pressures. Temperature in the system is  fairly
constant throughout the year. The flow in the shaft is a plug-fl ow
mode. The F/M ratios are 0.5 to 5.0 per day and the HRT ranges fr om
0.5 to 5 h.
A flotation tank serves for the separation of the biomass (solids) from
the supernatant. Most of the solids are recirculated to the deep shaft
reactor, and some are wasted to an aerobic digester. The effluent of t he
reactor is supersaturated with air when exposed to atmospheric  pres-
sure. The release of dissolved air from the mixed liquor forms bubbl es
that float suspended solids to the surface of the flotation tank.
Figure 6.26 Schematic diagram of deep shaft activated-sludge system.Wastewater Engineering 681
The advantages of the deep shaft reactor include lower construction
and operational costs, less land requirement, capability to handle big
organic loads, and suitability for all climatic condition s.
Biological nitriﬁcation. Conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate can
be achieved by biological nitrification. Biological nitrifica tion is performed
either in single-stage activated-sludge carbon oxidation and a mmonia
reduction or in separate continuous-flow stir-tank reactors or pl ug-flow.
The single-stage nitrification process is used for general applic ation
for nitrogen control where inhibitory industrial wastes are not  present.
The process also removes 85% to 95% of BOD.
The design criteria for single-stage activated-sludge nitrificat ion are:
volumetric BOD loading /H110050.08 to 0.32 kg/(m3/H11080d) (5 to 20 lb/(1000
ft3/H11080d)); MLSS /H110051500 to 3500 mg/L; u/H110056 to 15 h; uc/H110058 to 12 days;
F/M /H110050.10 to 0.25 per day; and Qr/Q /H110050.50 to 1.50 (Metcalf and Eddy,
Inc. 1991; WEF and ASCE, 1991a).
The advantage of the separate-stage suspended-growth nitrification
system is its flexibility to be optimized to conform to the nitri fication
needs. The separate-stage process is used to update existing syst ems
where nitrogen standards are stringent or where inhibitory in dustrial
wastes are present and can not be removed in the previous stages .
The design criteria for the separate-stage nitrification process a re: vol-

details on single-stage and separate-stage biological nitrifica tion are
given under advanced treatment for nitrogen removal in a later section.
21.8 Aeration and mixing systems
The treatment efficiency of an activated-sludge process depends on th e
oxygen dissolved in the aeration tank and the transfer of oxygen supply
from the air and from pure oxygen. Oxygen is transferred to the m ixed
liquor in an aeration tank by dispersing compressed air bu bbles through
submerged diffusers with compressors or by entraining air int o the
mixed liquor by surface aerators. A combination of the above has also
been used. An air diffusion system consists of air filters and other
conditioning equipment, blowers, air piping, and diffusers,  including dif-
fuser cleaning devices.
A large number of combinations of mixing/aeration equipment and
tank configuration have been developed.
Oxygen transfer and utilization. Oxygen transfer is a two-step process.
Gaseous oxygen is first dissolved in the mixed liquor by diffus ion or682 Chapter 6
mechanical aeration or both. The dissolved oxygen is utilized by  the
microorganisms in the process of metabolism of the organic matter .
When the rate of oxygen utilization exceeds the rate of oxygen dissolu-
tion, the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the mixed liquor will be depl eted. This
should be avoided. DO should be measured periodically, especial ly
during the period of peak loading, and the air supply then a djusted
accordingly.
The rate of oxygen transfer from air bubbles into solution is writ ten
as (Hammer, 1986)
r /H11005k(bCs– Ct) (6.113)
where r /H11005rate of oxygen transfer from air to liquid, mg/(L /H11080h)

(Table 1.2), mg/L
Ct/H11005DO concentration in mixed liquor, mg/L
bCs– Ct/H11005DO deficit, mg/L
The greater the DO deficit, the higher the rate of oxygen transfer. The
oxygen transfer coefficient k depends on wastewater characteristics
and, more importantly, on the physical features of the aeration,  liquid
depth of the aeration tank, mixing turbulence, and tank confi guration.
The rate of DO utilization is essentially a function of F/M ratio and
liquid temperature. The biological uptake of DO is approximatel y
30 mg/(L /H11080h) for the conventional activated-sludge process, generally less
than 10 mg/(L /H11080h) for extended aeration, and as high as 100 mg/(L /H11080h)
for high-rate aeration. Aerobic biological reaction is independent  of DO
above a minimum critical concentration. However, if DO is below  the
critical value, the metabolism of microorganisms is limited by reduced
oxygen supply. Critical concentrations reported for various ac tivated-
sludge systems range from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/L, the most commonly b eing
0.5 mg/L (Hummer, 1986). Ten States Standards stipulates th at aera-
tion equipment shall be capable of maintaining a minimum of 2.0 mg/L
of DO in mixed liquor at all times and provide thorough mixi ng of the
mixed liquor (GLUMRB, 1996).
Oxygen requirements generally depend on maximum diurnal organ ic
loading (design peak hourly BOD5), degree of treatment, and MLSS. The
Ten States Standards (GLUMRS, 1996) further recommends that t he
normal design air requirement for all activated-sludge processes  except
extended aeration shall provide 1500 ft3/lb of BOD5loading (94 m3/kg
BOD5). For extended aeration the value shall be 2050 ft3/lb of BOD5
(128 m3/kg of BOD5). The design oxygen requirement for all activated-
sludge processes shall be 1.1 lb oxygen/lb design peak hourly  BOD5 applied.Wastewater Engineering 683
Example 1: Compare the rate of oxygen transfer when the existing DOs in
the mixed liquor are 3.0 and 0.5 mg/L. Assume the transfer c oefficient is

Note : The higher the DO deficit, the greater the oxygen transfer rate.

(20/H11034C, 760 mm Hg, and 36% relative humidity) contains 0.279 k g of oxygen.

Diffused air aeration. A diffused air aeration system consists of diffusers
submerged in the mixed liquor, header pipes, air mains, blow ers (air
compressors), and appurtenances through which the air passes . Ceramic
diffusers (porous and nonporous) are manufactured as tubes, domes, or
plates. Other diffusers, such as jets or U-tubes, may be used.  Compressed684 Chapter 6
air forced through the diffusers is released as fine bubbles. The ox ygen
is then introduced to the liquid.
The oxygen requirement for the aeration can be calculated using
Eq. (6.94) or (6.95). In practice, the efficiency of oxygen transfer  of a
diffusion and sparging device seldom exceeds 8%. The oxygen trans-
fer efficiency for various bubble sizes is available from the manu-
facturer’s data. The diffuser system should be capable of providi ng
for 200% of the designed average daily oxygen demand (GLUMRB,
1996).
Air piping. As compressed air flows through a pipe, its volume changes
according to the pressure drop. The total headloss from the blower (or
silencer outlet) to the diffuser inlet shall not exceed 0.5 lb/in2(3.4 kPa)
under average operational conditions (GLUMRB, 1996). The pressure
drop in a pipeline carrying compressed air can be calculat ed by the
Darcy–Weisbach formula (Eq. (4.17)).
The value of friction factor fcan be determined from the Moody dia-
gram. However, as an approximation, the friction factor of a steel  pipe
carrying compressed air is expressed as (Steel and McGhee, 197 9)
f/H110050.029 D0.027/Q0.148(SI units) (6.114)

Blower. The blower (compressor) is used to convey air up to 103 kPa
(15 lb/in2). There are two types of blower commonly used for aeration,
i.e. rotary position displacement (PD) and centrifugal units. Centrifugal
blowers are usually used when the air supply is greater tha n 85 m3/min
(3000 ft3/min or cfm) and are popular in Europe. For pressures up to 50
to 70 kPa (7 to 10 lb/in2) and flows greater than 15 m3/min (530 ft3/min),
centrifugal blowers are preferable. Rotary PD blowers are used pri ma-
rily in small plants. Air flow is low when pressure is over  40 to 50 kPa
(6 to 7 lb/in2) and plant flows are less than 15 m3/min (530 ft3/min)
(Steel and McGhee, 1979).
As an advantage, PD blowers are capable of operating over a wid e
range of discharge pressure, but it is difficult to adjust t heir air flow rate
(only the speed is adjustable), they require more maintenance, an d are
noisy. In contrast, centrifugal blowers are less noisy in oper ation and
take up less space. Their disadvantages include a limited r ange of oper-
ating pressure and reduced air flow when there is any increas e in back-
pressure because of diffuser clogging. In many plants, single-s tage
centrifugal blowers can provide the head requirement (6 m or 20 ft of
water). If higher pressures are needed, multiple units can prov ide a
pressure of 28 m (90 ft) of water.
The power requirements for a blower may be estimated from the air
flow, inlet and discharge pressures, and air temperature by the follow-
ing equation which is based on the assumption of adiabatic compression
conditions.

As stated above, for higher discharge pressure application (>55  kPa,
>8 lb/in2) and for capacity smaller than 85 m3/min (3000 ft3/min) of free
air per unit, rotary-lobe PD blowers are generally used. PD blower s are
also used when significant water level variations are expected.  The units
cannot be throttled. Rugged inlet and discharge silencers ar e essential
(Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991).
Example: Estimate the power requirement of a blower providing 890 kg of
oxygen per day through a diffused air system with an oxygen t ransfer effi-
ciency of 7.2%. Assume the inlet temperature is 27 /H11034C, the discharge pressure

Mechanically aerated systems. Mechanical aerators consist of electrical
motors and propellers mounted on either a floating or a fixed supp ort.
The electrically driven propellers throw the bulk liquid throu gh the air
and oxygen transfer occurs both at the surface of the droplets an d at the
surface of the mixed liquor. Mechanical aerators may be mounted on
either a horizontal or a vertical axis. Each group is divid ed into surface
or submerged, high-speed (900–1800 rev/min) or low-speed (40 to 50
rev/min) (Steel and McGhee, 1979). Low-speed aerators are more expen-
sive than high-speed ones but have fewer mechanical problems and  are
more desirable for biological floc formation. Selection of aerators is
based on oxygen transfer efficiency and mixing requirements. Effect ive
mixing is a function of liquid depth, unit design, and pow er supply.
Mechanical aerators are rated on the basis of oxygen transfer ra te,
expressed as kg of oxygen per kW /H11080h (or lb/hp /H11080h) under standard con-
ditions, in which tap water with 0.0 mg/L DO (with sodiu m sulfite added)
is tested at the temperature of 20 /H11034C. Commercially available surface
reaerators range from 1.2 to 2.4 kg O2/kW /H11080h (2 to 4 lb O2/hp /H11080h) (Metcalf
and Eddy, Inc. 1991).
Mechanical aerator requirements depend on the manufacturer’s
rating, the wastewater quality, the temperature, the altitu de, and the
desired DO level. The standard performance data must be adjust ed
to the anticipated field conditions, using the following equat ion

Aerated lagoon. An aerated lagoon (pond) is a complete-mix flow-
through system with or without solids recycle. Most systems operate
without solids recycle. If the solids are returned to the lagoon,  the system
becomes a modified activated-sludge process.
The lagoons are 3 to 4 m (10 to 13 ft) deep. Solids in the complete-m ix
aerated pond are kept suspended at all times by aerators. Oxy gen is usu-
ally supplied by means of surface aerators or diffused air devic es.
Depending on the hydraulic retention time, the effluent from an aer ated
pond will contain from one-third to one-half the concentration of the
influent BOD in the form of cell tissue (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc.  1991).
These solids must be removed by settling before the effluent is dis-
charged. Settling can take place at a part of the aerated pon d system
separated with baffles or in a sedimentation basin.
The design factors for the process include BOD removal, temperatur e
effects, oxygen requirements, mixing requirements, solids separat ion,
and effluent characteristics. BOD removal and the effluent char acter-
istics are generally estimated using a complete-mix hydrauli c model
and first-order reaction kinetics. The mathematical relationshi p for
BOD removal in a complete-mix aerated lagoon is derived from the fol -
lowing equation

22 Trickling Filter
A trickling filter is actually a unit process for introduci ng primary efflu-
ent into contact with biological growth and is a biological  oxidation bed.
The word “filter” does not mean any filtering or straining acti on; nev-
ertheless, it is popularly and universally used.
22.1 Process description
The trickling filter is the most commonly used unit of the fixed-g rowth
film-flow-type process. A trickling filter consists of: (1) a bed of c oarse
material, such as stone slates or plastic media, over which  wastewater
from primary effluent is sprayed; (2) an underdrain system; an d (3) dis-
tributors. The underdrain is used to carry wastewater passi ng through
the biological filter and drain to the subsequent treatment un its and to
provide ventilation of the filter and maintenance of the aerobic con di-
tion. Wastewater from the primary effluent is distributed to th e surface
of the filter bed by fixed spray nozzles (first developed) or rotary dis -
tributors. Sloughs of biomass from the media are settled in the second-
ary sedimentation tank.
Biological slime occurs on the surface of the support media whil e
oxygen is supplied by air diffusion through the void spaces. It allows
wastewater to trickle (usually in an intermittent fashion) dow nward
through the bed media. Organic and inorganic nutrients ar e extracted
from the liquid film by the microorganisms in the slime. The b iological
slime layer consists of aerobic, anaerobic, and facultative ba cteria, algae,
fungi, and protozoans. Higher animals such as sludge worms, filter-fly
larvae, rotifers, and snails are also present. Facultative ba cteria are the
predominant microorganisms in the trickling filter. Nitrify ing bacteria
may occur in the lower part of a deep filter.
The biological activity of the trickling filter process can be described
as shown in Fig. 6.27. The microbial layer on the filter is a erobic usu-
ally to a depth of only 0.1 to 0.2 mm. Most of the depth of the m icrobial
film is anaerobic. As the wastewater flows over the slime layer,  organic
matter (nutrient) and dissolved oxygen are transferred to the aerob ic
zone by diffusion and extracted, and then metabolic end products  such
as carbon dioxide are released to the water.
Dissolved oxygen in the liquid is replenished by adsorption fr om air
in the voids surrounding the support media. Microorganisms near the
surface of the filter bed are in a rapid growth rate due to plent eous foodWastewater Engineering 697
supply, whereas microorganisms in the lower portion of the filter  may
be in a state of starvation. Overall, a trickling filter oper ation is con-
sidered to be in the endogenous growth phase. When slime becomes
thicker and cells die and lyse, the slime layer will slough  off and is sub-
sequently removed by secondary settling.
For over a century, the trickling filter has been used as a sec ondary
treatment unit. In a rock-fill conventional trickling filter,  the rock size
is 25 to 100 mm (1 to 4 in). The depth of the rock bed varies from  0.9 to
2.5 m (3 to 8 ft) with an average of 1.8 m (6 ft). The Ten States Standards
recommends a minimum depth of trickling filter media of 1.8 m above the
underdrains and that a rock and/or slag filter shall not exceed 3 m (10 ft)
in depth (GLUMRB, 1996).
After declining in use in the late 1960s and early 1970s b ecause of
the development of RBC, trickling filters regained popularity i n the late
1970s and 1980s, primarily due to new synthetic media. Th e new high-
rate media were generally preferred over rocks because they are ligh ter,
increased the surface area for biological growth, and improved t reatment
Figure 6.27 Schematic diagram of attached-growth process.698 Chapter 6
efficiency. High-rate media minimizes many of the common problems
with rock media, such as uncontrolled sloughing, plugging , odors, and
filter flies. Consequently, almost all trickling filters const ructed in the
late 1980s have been of high-rate media type (WPCF, 1988b).
Plastic media built in square, round, and other modules of cor rugated
shape have become popular. The depths of these plastic media rang e
from 4 to 12 m (14 to 40 ft) (US EPA, 1980; Metcalf and Eddy,  Inc. 1991).
These materials increase void ratios and air flow. The plastics  are 30%
lighter than rock. A minimum clearance of 0.3 m (1 ft) between m edia
and distribution arms shall be provided (GLUMRB, 1996).
22.2 Filter classiﬁcation
Trickling filters are classified according to the applied hy draulic and organic
loading rates. The hydraulic loading rate is expressed as th e quantity of
wastewater applied per day per unit area of bulk filter surfac e (m3/(d /H11080m2),
gal/(d /H11080ft2), or Mgal/(d /H11080acre) or as depth of wastewater applied per unit
of time. Organic loading rate is expressed as mass of BOD5applied per day
per unit of bulk filter volume (kg/(m3/H11080d), lb/(1000 ft3/H11080 d)). Common clas-
sifications, are low- or standard-rate, intermediate-rate, high-r ate, super-
high-rate, and roughing. Two-stage filters are frequently used, in which two
trickling filters are connected in series. Various trickling  filter classifica-
tions are summarized in Table 6.14.
22.3 Recirculation
Recirculation of a portion of the effluent to flow back through the fi lter
is generally practised in modern trickling filter plants. The ratio of the
return flow Qr, to the influent flow Q is called the recirculation ratio r.
Techniques of recirculation vary widely, with a variety of con figura-
tions. The recirculation ratios range from 0 to 4 (Table 6.14) w ith usual
ratios being 0.5 to 3.0.
The advantages of recirculation include an increase in biologic al solids
in the system with continuous seeding of active biological mat erial; elim-
ination of shock load by diluting strong influent; maintenan ce of more
uniform hydraulic and organic loads; an increase in the DO  level of the
influent; thinning of the biological slime layer; an improvemen t of treat-
ment efficiency; reduction of filter clogging; and less nuisance problems.
22.4 Design formulas
Attempts have been made by numerous investigators to correlate op er-
ational data with the design parameters of trickling filters . The design
of trickling filter plants is based on empirical, semiempiri cal, and mass
balance concepts. Mathematical equations have been developed for699TABLE 6.14 Typical Design Information for Trickling Filter Categories

calculating the BOD5removal efficiency of biological filters on the basis
of factors such as bed depth, types of media, recirculation, tem perature,
and loading rates. The design formulations of trickling filters  of major
interest include the NRC formula (1946), Velz formula (1948), Fair all
(1956), Schulze formula (1960), Eckenfelder formula (1963), Galler a nd
Gotaas formulas (1964, 1966), Germain formula (1966), Kincann on and
Stover formula (1982), Logan formula (Logan et al., 1987a, b), and British
multiple regression analysis equation (1988). These are summari zed
elsewhere (WEF and ASCE, 1991a; McGhee, 1991).
NRC formula. The NRC (National Research Council) formula for
trickling-filter performance is an empirical expression developed by
the National Research Council from an extensive study of the oper-
ating data of trickling treatment plants at military ba ses within the
United States during World War II in the early 1940s (NRC , 1946).
It may be applied to single-stage and multistage rock filters  with
varying recirculation ratios. Graphic expressions for BOD r emoval
efficiency are available. The equation for a single-stage or first-st age
rock filter is

The recirculation factor represents the average number of passes of t he
influent organic matter through the trickling filter. For the second-
stage filter, the formula becomes

Other terms are as described previously. Overall BOD removal efficiency
of a two-stage filter system can be computed by
(6.134)
where the term 35 means that 35% of BOD of raw wastewater is
removed by primary settling.
BOD removal efficiency in biological treatment process is signi ficantly
influenced by wastewater temperature. The effect of temperature can
be calculated as

Formulation for plastic media. Numerous investigations have been under-
taken to predict the performance of plastic media in the trickl ing filter
process. The Eckenfelder formula (1963) and the Germain (1965) appl ied
Schulze formulation (1960) are the ones most commonly used to descri be
the performance of plastic media packed trickling filters.
Eckenfelder formula. Eckenfelder (1963) and Eckenfelder and Barnhart
(1963) developed an exponential formula based on the rate of waste
removal for a pseudo-first-order reaction, as below:

The mean time of contact t of wastewater with the filter media is related
to the filter depth, the hydraulic loading rate, and the nat ure of the filter
packing. The relationship is expressed as

Eq. (6.136) may be simplified to the following form
Se/Si/H11005exp[– kD/qn] (6.139)
where k is a new rate constant, per day.
Example: Estimate the effluent soluble BOD5from a 6-m (20-ft) plastic packed
trickling filter with a diameter of 18 m (60 ft). The influent fl ow is 4540 m3/d
(1.2 Mgal/d) and the influent BOD is 140 mg/L. Assume that  the rate constant

Germain formula. In 1966, Germain applied the Schultz (1960) formula-
tion to a plastic media trickling filter and proposed a firs t-order equation
as follows:
Se/Si/H11005exp[– k20D/qn] (6.140)
where Se/H11005total BOD5of settled effluent, mg/L
Si/H11005total BOD5of wastewater applied to filter, mg/L

D /H11005depth of filter
q /H11005hydraulic loading rate, m3/(m2/H11080d) or gal/min/ft2
n /H11005exponent constant of media, usually 0.5
The treatability constant at another depth of the filter must b e corrected
for depth when the k20value is determined at one depth. The relation-
ship proposed by Albertson and Davis (1984) is
k2/H11005k1(D1/D2)x(6.141)
where k2/H11005treatability constant corresponding to depth D2of filter 2
k1/H11005treatability constant corresponding to depth
D1 of filter 1
D1/H11005depth of filter 1, ft
D2/H11005depth of filter 2, ft
x /H110050.5 for vertical and rock media filters
/H110050.3 for crossflow plastic media filters
The values of k1and k2are a function of wastewater characteristics, the
depth and configuration of the media, surface area of the filter, d osing
cycle, and hydraulic loading rate. They are interdependent. G ermain
(1966) reported that the value of k for a plastic media filter 6.6 m (21.6 ft)
deep, treating domestic wastewater, was 0.24 (L/s)n/m2and that n is 0.5.
This VFC media had a surface area of 88 m2/m3(27 ft2/ft3). The ranges
ofk values in (L/s)0.5/m2for a 6-m (20-ft) tower trickling filter packed
with plastic media at 20 /H11034C are 0.18 to 0.27 for domestic wastewater, 0.16
to 0.22 for domestic and food waste, 0.054 to 0.14 for fruit-cann ing
wastes, 0.081 to 0.14 for meat packing wastes, 0.054 to 0. 11 for paper
mill wastes, 0.095 to 0.14 for potato processing, and 0.054  to 0.19 for a
refinery. Multiplying the value in (L/s)0.5/m2 by 0.37 obtains the value
in (gal/min)0.5/ft2.
Distributor speed. The dosing rate of BOD5is very important for treatment
efficiency. The instantaneous dosing rate is a function of the d istributor708 Chapter 6
speed or the on–off times for a fixed distributor. The rotational speed  of
a rotary distributor is expressed as follows:

a/H11005number of arms in rotary distributor assembly
DR /H11005dosing rate, cm or in per pass of distributor arm
The required dosing rates in inches per pass for trickling fil ters is
determined approximately by multiplying the organic loading  rate,
expressed in lb BOD5/1000 ft3, by 0.12. For SI units, the dosing rate
in cm per pass can be obtained by multiplying the loading  rate in
kg/m3by 0.30.
Example: Design a 8.0 m (26 ft) deep plastic packed trickling filter to treat
domestic wastewater and seasonal (summer) food-process wastewater wi th
given conditions as follows:

23 Rotating Biological Contactor
The use of plastic media to develop the rotating biological contac tor
(RBC) was commercialized in Germany in the late 1960s. The proc ess
is a fixed-film (attached growth) either aerobic or anaerobic biolog ical
treatment system for removal of carbonaceous and nitrogenous mate-
rials from domestic and industrial wastewaters. It was ver y popular
during the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United Stat es.
The RBC process can be used to modify and upgrade existing trea t-
ment systems as secondary or tertiary treatment. It has been success-
fully applied to all three steps of biological treatment, that is BOD5
removal, nitrification, and denitrification.
The majority of RBC installations in the northern United Stat es
have been designed for removal of BOD5or ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N),
or both, from domestic wastewater. Currently in the United Sta tes
there are approximately 600 installations for domestic wastewa ter
treatment and more than 200 for industrial wastewater treatm ent.
Over 1000 installations have been used in Europe, especially in
Germany. 50.025srev/mindn50.00044312.1

Figure 6.28 (A) RBC units, (B) A view of an 84-unit RBCs
for nitrification in Peoria, Illinois.23.1 Hardware
The basic elements of the RBC system are media, shaft, bearings,
drive, and cover. The RBC hardware consists of a large-diameter and
closely spaced circular plastic media which is mounted on a horizon-
tal shaft (Fig. 6.28). The shaft is supported by bearings and  is slowly
rotated by an electric motor. The plastic media are made of corru gated
polyethylene or polystyrene material with various sizes and confi gu-
rations and with various densities. The configuration designs  are based
on increasing stiffness and surface area, serving as spaces p roviding
a tortuous wastewater flow path and stimulating air turbu lence. As an
exception, the Bio-Drum process consists of a drum filled with 3 8 mm

The diameters of the media range from 4 ft (1.22 m) to 12 ft (3.66 m ),
depending on the treatment capacity. The shaft lengths vary fr om 5 ft
(1.52 m) to 27 ft (8.23 m), depending on the size of the RBC unit
(Banerji, 1980). Commonly used RBC shafts are generally 25 to 27 ft
(6.62 to 8.23 m) in length with a media diameter of 12 ft (3.6 6 m).
Standard density media provide 100,000 ft2(9290 m2) of surface area.
About 40% of the media is immersed in the wastewater at any ti me
in trapezoidal, semicircular, or flat-bottom rectangular tank s with
intermediate partitions in some cases. The shaft rotates at 1.5  to 
1.7 rev/min for mechanical drive and 1.0 to 1.3 rev/min for air drive
units (Fig. 6.29). The wastewater flows can be perpendicular to or par-
allel to the shafts.
23.2 Process description
In domestic wastewater treatment, the RBC does not require seedin g
to establish the biological growth. After RBC system startup , microor-
ganisms naturally present in the wastewater begin to adhere to the
rotating media surface and propagate until, in about 1 week,  the entire

Figure 6.30 Mechanism for attached growth media in RBC system.surface area will be covered with an approximately 1- to 4-mm t hick
layer of biological mass (biomass). The attached biomass contain s about
50,000 to 100,000 mg/L suspended solids (Antonie, 1978). The m icroor-
ganisms in the film of biomass (biofilm) on the media remove biodegr ad-
able organic matter, nitrogen, and dissolved oxygen in wastew ater and
convert the pollutants to more benign components (biomass and ga seous
by-products).
In the first-stage RBC biofilm, the most commonly observed fila-
mentous bacterium is Sphaerotilus , Beggiatoa (a sulfur bacterium);
Cladothrix, Nocardia, Oscillatoria, and filamentous fungus, Fusarium,
are also found, though less frequently. Nonfilamentous organisms in the
first stage are Zocloea and Zooglear filipendula, Aerobacter aerogen,
Escherichia coli, unicellular rods, spirilla and spirochaetes, and uni-
cellular algae. The final stages harbor mostly the same forms of biota
in addition to Athrobotrys and Streptomyces reported by investigators
(Pretorius, 1971; Torpey et al., 1971; Pescod and Nair, 1972; Sudo et al. ,
1977; Clark et al., 1978; Hitdlebaugh and Miller, 1980; Hoag et al. , 1980;
Kinner et al. , 1982).
In continuous rotation, the media carry films of wastewater in to the
air, which then trickle down through the liquid film surfa ce into the bulk
liquid (Figs. 6.30 and 6.31). They also provide the surface ar ea neces-
sary for absorbing oxygen from air. Intimate contact between th e waste-
water and the biomass creates a constantly moving surface ar ea for the
bacteria-substrate-oxygen interface. The renewed liquid layer (wast e-
water film) on the biomass is rich in DO. Both substrates a nd DOWastewater Engineering 715
penetrate the liquid film through mixing and diffusion into t he biofilm
for biological oxidation. Excess DO in the wastewater film is mixed with
bulk wastewater in the tank and results in aeration of the w astewater.
The rotating media are used for supporting growth of microorganis ms
and for providing contact between the microorganisms, the subs trates,
and DO.
A group of RBC units is usually separated by baffling into s tages to
avoid short circuiting in the tank. There can be one shaft or more in a
stage. The hydraulic detention time in each stage is relativel y short, on
Figure 6.31 Relative concentration of substrate and dis-
solved oxygen for a loading condition and RBC rotation
speed as a function of media location (source: US EPA 1984).716 Chapter 6
the order of 20 min under normal loading. Each RBC stage tend s to oper-
ate as a complete-mix reactor. The density and species of microbia l pop-
ulation in each stage can vary significantly, depending on  wastewater
loading conditions. If RBCs are designed for secondary treatment , heavy
microbial growth, shaggy and gray in color, develops. Good c arbonaceous
removal usually occurs in the first and second stages. The su cceeding
stages can be used for nitrification, if designed, which will  exhibit nitri-
fier growth, brown in color.
The shearing process from rotation exerted on the biomass periodi-
cally sloughs off the excess biomass from the media into the wast e-
water stream. This sloughing action prevents bridging and clogging
between adjacent media. The mixing action of the rotating media keeps
the sloughed biomass in suspension from settling to the RBC ta nk. The
sloughed-off solids flow from stage to stage and finally into the cl arifier
following the RBC units. Intermediate clarification and slud ge recycle
are not necessary for the RBC process.
In comparison with other biological treatment process, the RBC
process differs from the trickling filter process by having sub stantially
longer retention time and dynamic rather than stationary med ia; and
from the activated-sludge process by having attached (fixed) biom ass
rather than a suspended culture and sludge recycle.
The patented Surfact process was created and developed by the
Philadelphia Wastewater Department (Nelson and Guarino, 1977).  The
process uses air-driven RBCs that are partially submerged i n the aer-
ation basins of an activated-sludge system. The RBCs provide fi xed-
film media for biological growth that are present in the recycl ed
activated sludge in the aeration tanks. The results are more a ctive bio-
logical coating on the fixed-film media than that which is fou nd on such
media when used as a separate secondary treatment. Surfact com bines
the advantages of both RBC (fixed-film growth) and activated-slud ge
systems in a single tank, producing additional biological  solids in the
system. The results can be either a higher treatment efficiency a t the
same flow rate or the same level of treatment at a higher flow rate.
23.3 Advantages
Whether used in a small or a large municipal wastewater trea tment
plant, the RBC process has provided 85% or more of BOD5and ammo-
nia nitrogen removal from sewage. In addition to high treatment  capac-
ity, it gives good sludge separation. It has the advantages  of smaller
operation and maintenance costs, and of simplicity in operati on. It can
be retrofitted easily to existing plants.
The RBC process is similar to the trickling filter (fixed-film b iolog-
ical reactor) and to the activated-sludge process (suspended cul ture inWastewater Engineering 717
the mixed liquor). However, the RBC has advantages over the tric k-
ling filter process, such as longer contact time (eight to ten times), rel-
atively low land requirement (40% less), and less excavation, m ore
surface area renewal for aeration, greater effectiveness for handling
shock loadings, effective sloughing off of the excessive biomass, and
without the nuisance of “filter flies.” The RBC system may use l ess
power than either the mechanical aeration (activated-sludge) or t he
trickling filter system of an equivalent capacity. It is a nticipated that
the RBC would exhibit a more consistent treatment efficiency dur ing
the winter months.
Over 95% of biological solids in the RBC units are attached t o the
media. These result in lower maintenance and power consumption of
the RBC process over the activated-sludge process. In comparison  with
the activated-sludge process, there is no sludge or effluent recycl e with
a minimum process control requirement. Less skilled personnel ar e
needed to operate the RBC process. A hydraulic surge or organic ov er-
loading will cause activated-sludge units to upset in proces s operation
and thereby cause sludge bulking. This is not the case for th e RBC
process, which has a better process stability. Other advan tages of the
RBC process over the activated-sludge process are relatively low land
requirement and less excavation, more flexibility for upgrading  treat-
ment facilities, less expense for nitrification, and better slud ge settling
without hindered settling.
23.4 Disadvantages
The problems of the first generation of RBC units are mainly caus ed by
the failure of hardware and equipment. Significant effort has been  made
to correct these problems by the manufacturers. The second or thir d gen-
eration of RBC units may perform as designed.
Capital and installation costs for the RBC system, includ ing an over-
head structure, will be higher than that for an activated-s ludge system
of equal capacity. The land area requirement for the RBC process is
about 30% to 40% about that for the activated-sludge process.
If low dissolved oxygen is coupled with available sulfide, the nuisance
bacteria Beggiatoa may grow on the RBC media (Hitdlebaugh and
Miller, 1980). The white biomass phenomenon is caused by the Beggiatoa
propagation. These problems can be corrected by addition of hydrog en
peroxide. Some minor disadvantages related to the RBC process as  well
as other biological treatment processes include that a large l and area
may be required for a very large facility, additional cost for enclosures,
possible foul odor problem, shock loading recovery, extremes of waste-
water, pH, Thiotrix or Beggiatoa growth, overloading, and controversy
regarding the technological nature of RBC.718 Chapter 6
23.5 Soluble BOD5
It is accepted that soluble BOD5(SBOD) is the control parameter for
RBC performance. The SBOD can be determined by the BOD test usi ng
filtrate from the wastewater samples. For RBC design purposes, i t can
also be estimated from historical data on total BOD (TBOD) and
suspended solids. The SBOD is suspended BOD subtracted from TB OD.
Suspended BOD is directly correlated with total suspended sol ids (TSS).
Their relationships are expressed as
SBOD /H11005TBOD /H11002suspended BOD (6.144)
Suspended BOD /H11005c(TSS) (6.145)

Example: Historical data of the primary effluent show that the average
TBOD is 145 mg/L and TSS is 130 mg/L. What is the influent SBOD con-
centration that can be used for the design of an RBC system? R BC is used as

23.6 RBC process design
Many studies employ either the Monod growth kinetics or Michael is—
Menton enzyme kinetics for modeling organic and nitrogenous removal s
by the RBC process. Under steady-state conditions and a complete-mix
chamber, based on the material mass balance expression for RBC  stages,
zero-, half-, and first-order kinetics, nonlinear second-order differenti alWastewater Engineering 719
equations, conceptional models, and empirical models have been p roposed.
However, the usefulness of these models to predict RBC performance is
not well established.
Factors affecting the RBC performance include wastewater temper-
ature, influent substrate concentration, hydraulic retention time, tank
volume to media surface area ratio, media rotational speed, and dis-
solved oxygen (Poon et al. , 1979).
Manufacturer’s empirical design approach. In the United States, the
design of an RBC system for most municipal wastewaters is nor mally
based on empirical curves developed by various manufacturers.
Unfortunately the empirical approach is often the least rationa l in its
methodologies and omits many important performance parameters. Th e
designers or the users have relied heavily on the manufacturers for
planning and design assistance.
The RBC design aspects for organic removal vary considerably a mong
the various manufacturers. For the design loading, Autotrol (En virex)
(1979) and Clow (1980) use applied SBOD5while Lyco (1982) uses
applied TBOD5. All can predict the water quality at intermediate points
in the treatment process and at the effluent. However, the predicted  per-
formances are quite different among manufacturers.
The manufacturer’s design curves are developed on the basis of
observed municipal RBC wastewater treatment performances. For
example, Figs. 6.32 and 6.33 show organic removal design cu rves. The
manufacturer’s empirical curves define effluent concentration (solu ble
or total BOD5or NH3-N) or percent removal in terms of applied hydraulic
loading rate or organic loading rate in conjunction with in fluent sub-
strate concentration.
In design, starting with a desired effluent concentration or p ercent
removal ( ①in Figs. 6.32 and 6.33) and given influent concentration ➁,
the hydraulic loading ➂can be selected. The RBC total media-surface
area required is calculated by dividing the design flow rat e by the
hydraulic loading derived.
Work by Antonie (1978) demonstrated that, for any kinetics order
higher than zero, overall BOD5removal for a given media surface area
is enhanced by increasing the number of stages. Table 6.15 g ives guide-
lines for stages recommended by three manufacturers.
One to four stages are recommended in most design manuals. A lar ge
number of stages are required to achieve higher removal efficiency. The
relationship between design curves and stages has not been esta blished
and the reasons for recommendations are not generally given. The st age
selection is an integral part of the design procedure and shoul d be used
intelligently. Based on substrate loading, the percent surfac e area for
the first stage can be determined from the manufacturer’s design  curves720 Chapter 6

Most RBC manufacturers have a standard ratio of tank volume to media
surface area at 1.2 gal/ft2(48.9 L/m2).
The manufacturers universally contend that wastewater tempera-
tures above 55 /H11034F (12.8 /H11034C) do not affect the organic removal rate. Below
55/H11034F varying degrees of decreased biological activity rate are predi cted
by the manufacturers. Surface area correction factors for wastewa ter
treatment below 55 /H11034F are shown in Table 6.17. Most manufacturers
require wastewater temperature not to exceed 90 /H11034F (32.2 /H11034C) which can
damage the RBC media. Fortunately, this is normally not the case for
municipal wastewaters.
In summary, an RBC system can be designed on the basis of i nfor-
mation on total required media surface area, temperature correcti on,
staging, and organic loading limits.
RBC performance histories relative to empirical design have been exam-
ined. Operational data indicated that the prediction result s from manu-
facturer’s design curves were considerably different from actual resultsOrganic (SBOD5) loading, lb/(d /H11080 1000 ft2)

(Opatken 1982, Brenner et al. , 1984). They usually gave an overestimate
of attainable removals. The manufacturer’s design curves should  be used
with caution whenever first-stage loading exceeds the recommended v alues.
Example 1: At the first stage of the RBC system, what is the maximum
hydraulic loading if the total BOD5for the influent and effluent are 150 and
60 mg/L, respectively?
solution:
Step 1. Calculate percent TBOD removal
Step 2. Determine hydraulic loading limit
From Fig. 6.32, starting with 60% TBOD removal at point 1, draw a horizontal
line to the intersect with the influent TBOD concentration of 150  mg/L at point
2. Next, starting at point 2, draw a vertical line to in tersect the hydraulic load-
ing axis at point 3. Read the value at point 3 as 5.8 ga l/(d /H11080ft2). This is the answer.
Example 2: Compute the hydraulic and organic loading rates of an RBC
system and of the first stage. Given:

Two units are used as the first stage.
Example 3: A municipal primary effluent with total and soluble BOD5of 140
and 60 mg/L, respectively, is to be treated with an RBC sys tem. The RBC efflu-
ent TBOD and SBOD is to be 24 and 12 mg/L, respectively, or less. The tem-
perature of wastewater is 60 /H11034F (above 55 /H11034F; no temperature correction
needed). The design plant flow is 4.0 Mgal/d (15,140 m3/d). The maximum
hourly flow is 10.0 Mgal/d (37,850 m3/d).

It is under 2.0 [lb /H11408(1000 ft2/H11080 d)], therefore OK.

ing. For this case, the size factor is 0.346 (0.2 /H110031.73, or 34.6% of total surface
area). This value can be obtained from the manufacturer’s curves .

24 Dual Biological Treatment
Dual biological treatment processes use a fixed film reactor in series with
a suspended growth reactor. Dual processes include such as a ctivated
biofilter, trickling filter-solids contact, roughing filter-act ivated sludge,
biofilter-activated sludge, trickling filter-activated sludge,  roughing
filter-RBC, roughing filter-aerated lagoon, roughing filter-faculta tive
lagoon, roughing filter-pure oxygen activated sludge. Descripti ons of
these dual processes may be found elsewhere (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc .
1991; WEF and ASCE, 1991a).
25 Stabilization Ponds
The terms stabilization pond, lagoon, oxidation pond have been us ed syn-
onymously. This is a relatively shallow earthen basin used a s second-
ary or tertiary wastewater treatment, especially in rural a reas.
Stabilization ponds have been employed for treatment of wastewater for
over 300 years. Ponds have become popular in small communities
because of their low construction and operating costs. They are u sed to
treat a variety of wastewaters from domestic and industrial w astes and
functions under a wide range of weather conditions. Ponds can be
employed alone or in combination with other treatment processes.Wastewater Engineering 727
Stabilization ponds can be classified as facultative (aerobic-a naerobic),
aerated, aerobic, and anaerobic ponds according to the dominan t type
of biological activity or reactions occurring in the pond. Ot her classifi-
cations can be based on the types of the influent (untreated, scr eened,
settled effluent, or secondary (activated-sludge) effluent), the durati on
of discharge (nonexistent, intermittent, and continuous), and t he method
of oxygenation (photosynthesis, atmospheric surface reaeration, and
mechanical aeration). Aerated ponds (aerated lagoons) have been dis -
cussed previously.
25.1 Facultative ponds
The most common type of stabilization pond is the facultative pond . It
is also called the wastewater lagoon. Facultative ponds are us ually
1.2 to 2.5 m (4 to 8 ft) in depth, with an aerobic layer overly ing an anaer-
obic layer, often containing sludge deposits. The d etention time is usually
5 to 30 days (US EPA, 1983b).
The ponds commonly receive no more pretreatment than screening
(few with primary effluent). It can also be used to follow trickli ng filters,
aerated ponds, or anaerobic ponds. They then store grit and heav y solids
in the first or primary ponds to form an anaerobic layer. The s ystem is
a symbiotic relationship between heterotrophic bacteria and al gae.
Bacteria found in an aerobic zone of a stabilization pond are pri ma-
rily of the same type as those found in an activated-sludge proc ess or in
the zoogleal mass of a trickling filter. The most frequently isolat ed bac-
teria include Beggiatoa alba, Sphaerotilus natans, Achromobacter,
Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Zoogloea spp. (Lynch
and Poole, 1979). These organisms decompose the organic materials
present in the aerobic zone into oxidized end products.
Organic matter in wastewater is decomposed by bacterial act ivities,
including both aerobic and anaerobic, which release phophorus , nitro-
gen, and carbon dioxide. Oxygen in the aerobic layer is supp lied by sur-
face reaeration and algal photosynthesis. Algae consume nutrien t and
carbon dioxide produced by bacteria and release oxygen to water.  DO is
used by bacteria, thus forming a symbiotic cycle. In the p ond bottom,
anaerobic breakdown of the solids in the sludge layer produces d is-
solved organics and gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, a nd hydro-
gen sulfide. Between the aerobic and anaerobic zones, there is a zone
called the facultative zone. Temperature is a major factor for the bio-
logical symbiotic activities.
Organic loading rates on stabilization ponds are expressed in  terms
of kg BOD5applied per hectare of surface area per day (lb BOD/
(acre /H11080d)), or sometimes as BOD equivalent population per unit area.
Typical organic loading rates are 22 to 67 kg BOD/(ha /H11080 d) (20 to 60 lb
BOD/(a /H11080 d)). Typical detention times range from 25 to 180 days. Typic al728 Chapter 6

Facultative ponds are commonly designed to reduce BOD to about
30 mg/L; but, in practice, it ranges from 30 to 40 mg/L or g reater due to
algae. Volatile organic removal is between 77% and 96%. Nitrogen
removal achieves 40% to 95%. Less phosphorus removal is observed,
being less than 40%. Effluent TSS levels range from 40 to 100 mg /L,
mainly contributed by algae (WEF and ASCE, 1991b). The presenc e of
algae in pond effluent is one of the most serious performance problems
associated with facultative ponds. The ponds are effective in remov al of
fecal coliform (FC) due to their dying off. In most cases effluent FC den -
sities are less than the limit of 200 FC/100 ml.
Process design. Several design formulas with operational data were
presented in the design manual (US EPA, 1974b). Calculation s of the size
of a facultative pond are also illustrated for the areal loading  rate pro-
cedure, Gloyna equation, Marais–Shaw equation, plug-flow model,  and
Wehner–Wilhelm equation. The design for partial-mix aerated lagoon  is
given elsewhere (WPCF, 1990). In this section, design methods of th e
areal loading rate method and the Wehner and Wilhelm model ar e
discussed.
Areal loading rate method. The design procedure is usually based on
organic loading rate and hydraulic residence time. Several em pirical
and rational models for the design of facultative ponds have been pro-
posed. Several proposed design methods have been discussed elsewhere
(US EPA, 1983b). The areal loading rate is the most conservati ve design
method and can be adapted to specific standards. The recommended
BOD loading rates based on average winter air temperature are given
in Table 6.18 (US EPA , 1974b).
The surface area required for the facultative pond is determined by
dividing the organic (BOD) load by the appropriate BOD loadi ng rate
listed in Table 6.18 or from the specific state standards. I t can beWastewater Engineering 729

The BOD loading rate at the first cell in a series of cells (pond s) should
not exceed 100 kg/(ha /H11080d) (90 lb/(acre /H11080d)) for warm climates, average
winter air temperature greater than 15 /H11034C (59 /H11034F), and 40 kg/(ha /H11080d)
(36 lb/(acre /H11080d)) for average winter air temperature less than 0 /H11034C (32 /H11034F).
Example 1: The design flow of facultative ponds for a small town is 1100 m3/d
(0.29 Mgal/d). The expected influent BOD is 210 mg/L. The averag e winter tem-
perature is 10 /H11034C (50 /H11034F). Design a three-cell system with organic loading less than
80 kg/(ha /H11080d) (72 lb/(acre /H11080d)) in the primary cell. Also estimate the hydraulic deten-
tion time when average sludge depth is 0.5 m and there are seep age and evapo-
ration losses of 2.0 mm of water per day.

because mean air temperature is 10 /H11034C. Using Eq. (6.147)

Figure 6.34 Relationship between kt values and percent BOD remaining
for various dispersions factors, by the Wehner-Wilhelm equation.
The Wehner-Wilhelm equation for arbitrary flow was proposed by
Thirumurthi (1969) as a method of designing facultative pond s ystems.
Thirumurthi developed a graph, shown in Fig. 6.34, to facili tate the use
of the equation. In Fig. 6.34, the term kt is plotted against the percent
BOD5remaining ( C/C0) in the effluent for dispersion factors varying
from zero for an ideal plug-flow reactor to infinity for a complete-mix
reactor. Dispersion factors for stabilization ponds range from 0. 1 to 2.0,
with most values not exceeding 1.0 due to the mixing requiremen t. Typical
values for the overall first-order BOD5removal rate constant k vary from
0.05 to 1.0 per day, depending on the operating and hydraul ic character-
istics of the pond. The use of the arbitrary flow equation is comp licated
in selecting k and D values. A value of 0.15 per day is recommended for
k20(US EPA, 1984). Temperature adjustment for k can be determined by

(1.06 to 2.05 hp/1000 ft3) for mixing (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991).
Tertiary ponds. Tertiary ponds, also called polishing or maturation ponds,
serve as the third-stage process for effluent from activated-sludge or
trickling filter secondary clarifier effluent. They are also used as a second
stage following facultative ponds and are aerobic throughout th eir depth.
The water depth of the tertiary pond is usually 1 to1.5 m (3 t o 4.5 ft).
BOD loading rates are less than 17 kg/(ha /H11080d) (15 lb/(acre /H11080d)). Detention
times are relatively short and vary from 4 to 15 days.
25.2 Aerobic ponds
Aerobic ponds, also referred to as high-rate aerobic ponds, are rel atively
shallow with usual depths ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 m (1 to 2 ft), allowing
light to penetrate the full depth. The ponds maintain DO throu ghout their
entire depth. Mixing is often provided to expose all algae to sun light and
to prevent deposition and subsequent anaerobic conditions. DO i s supplied
by algal photosynthesis and surface reaeration. Aerobic bacter ia utilize and
stabilize the organic waste. The HRT in the ponds is short—3 to 5  days. 540.0   lbsacre #  dd 543.8 kg/sha  # dd Loading51100 m3/d3210 g/m3

The use of aerobic ponds is limited to warm and sunny climates , espe-
cially where a high degree of BOD removal is required but the l and
area is not limited. However, very little coliform die-off occurs.
25.3 Anaerobic ponds
Anaerobic ponds are usually deep and are subjected to heavy org anic
loading. There is no aerobic zone in an anaerobic pond. The depths of
anaerobic ponds usually range from 2.5 to 5 m (8 to 16 ft). The deten-
tion times are 20 to 50 days (US EPA, 1983b).
Anaerobic bacteria decompose organic matter to carbon dioxide an d
methane. The principal biological reactions are acid formation and
methane fermentation. These processes are similar to those of anaero-
bic digestion of sludge. Odorous compounds, such as organic a cids and
hydrogen sulfide, are also produced.
Anaerobic ponds are usually used to treat strong industrial  and agri-
cultural wastes. They have been used as pretreatment to faculta tive or
aerobic ponds for strong industrial wastewaters and for rural  commu-
nities with high organic load, such as food processing. They are not in
wide application for municipal wastewater treatment.
The advantages of anaerobic ponds compared with an aerobic treat -
ment process are low production of waste biological sludge and n o need
for aeration equipment. An important disadvantage of the anaerob ic
pond is the generation of odorous compounds. Its incomplete stabil iza-
tion of waste requires a second-stage aerobic process. It requires a rel-
atively high temperature for anaerobic decomposition of wastes.
Normal operation, to achieve a BOD removal efficiency of at least
75%, entails a loading rate of 0.32 kg B0D/(m3 /H11080 d) (20 lb/(1000 ft3 /H11080 d)),
a minimum detention time of 4 days, and a minimum operating  tem-
perature of 24 /H11034C (75 /H11034F) (Hummer, 1986).
26 Secondary Clariﬁer
The secondary settling tank is an integral part of both susp ended-
and attached-growth biological treatment processes. It is vit al to the
operation and performance of the activated-sludge process. The clar-
ifier separates MLSS from the treated wastewater prior to dischar ge.
It thickens the MLSS before their turn in the aeration tank or their
wasting.
Secondary clarifiers are generally classified as Type 3 settli ng. Types
1 and 2 may also occur. The sloughed-off solids are commonly well-
oxidized particles that settle readily. On the other hand, gr eater viability
of activated sludge results in lighter, more buoyant flocs, wi th reduced
settling velocities. In addition, this is the result of micr obial production
of gas bubbles that buoy up the tiny biological clusters.736 Chapter 6

The Ten States Standards (GLUMRB, 1996) recommends that surfac e
overflow rate for the settling tank following trickling filter sh ould not
exceed 1200 gal/(d /H11080ft2) (49 m3/(m3 /H11080 d)) based on design peak hourly flow.
In practice, typical overflow rates are 600 gal/(d /H11080 ft2) (24.4 m3/(m2/H11080 d)) for
plants smaller than 1 Mgal/d (3785 m3/d) and 800 gal/(d /H11080 ft2) (33 m3/(m2/H11080 d))
for larger plants. The minimum side water depth is 10 ft (3 m ) with
greater depths for larger diameter basins. The retention time in the sec-
ondary settling tank is in the range of 2 to 3 h. The maximu m recom-
mended weir loading rate is 20,000 gal/(d /H11080 ft) (250 m3/(d /H11080 m)) for plants
equal or less than 1 Mgal/d and 30,000 gal/(d /H11080 ft) (373 m3/(d /H11080 m)) for plants
greater than 1 Mgal/d (3785 m3/d).
Secondary clarifiers following trickling filters are usually sized on the
basis of the hydraulic loading rate. Typical design param eters for sec-
ondary clarifiers are listed in Table 6.19 (US EPA, 1975a).  Referring to the
hydraulic loading rates from Table 6.20, sizing should be c alculated for both
peak and design average flow conditions and the largest value calculated
should be used. At the selected hydraulic loading rates, sett led effluent
quality is limited primarily by the performance of the biologi cal reactor,
not of the settling basins. Solids loading limits are not in volved in the size
of clarifiers following trickling filters. Where further treatment follows the
clarifier, cost optimization may be considered in sizing the set tling basins.Wastewater Engineering 737

high in activated-sludge processes, their surface overflow rate a nd weir
overflow rate should be adjusted for the various modified processes t o
minimize the problems with sludge loadings, density currents , inlet
hydraulic turbulence, and occasional poor sludge settle-abili ty. The size
of the secondary settling tank must be based on the large surfa ce area
determined for surface overflow rate and solids loading rate. Tabl e 6.20
presents the design criteria for secondary clarifiers following a ctivated-
sludge processes (GLUMRB, 1996). The values given in Tables 6.1 9 and
6.20 are comparable.
Solids loading rate is of primary importance to insure adequa te func-
tion in the secondary settling tanks following aeration basin s. In practice,
most domestic wastewater plants have values of solids volume in dex in
the range of 100 to 250 mg/L (WEF and ASCE, 1991a). Detail dis cussions
of the secondary clarifier can be found in this manual. Most d esign engi-
neers prefer to keep the maximum solids loading rates in the ran ge of
4 to 6 kg/(m2/H11080h) (20 to 30 lb/(d /H11080ft2)). Solids loadings rates of 10 kg/(m2/H11080h)
(50 lb/(d /H11080ft2) or more have been found in some well-operating plants.
The maximum allowable hydraulic loading rate HLR as a functi on of
the initial settling velocity ISV at the design MLSS concent ration was
proposed by Wilson and Lee (1982). The equation is expressed as follow s:
(6.151)
where HRT /H11005hydraulic retention time, h

ISV /H11005initial settling velocity at the design MLSS

CSF /H11005clarifier safety factor, 1.5 to 3, typically 2
The values of ISV change with MLSS concentrations and other cond i-
tions. Batch-settling analyses should be performed. The maximum  antic-
ipated operational MLSS or the corresponding minimum ISV shoul d be
used in Eq. (6.151).
Numerous state regulations limit the maximum allowable weir load-
ing rates to 124 m3/(d /H11080m) (10,000 gal/(d /H11080ft)) for small plants (less than
3785 m3/d or 1 Mgal/d) and to 186 m3/(d /H11080m) (15,000 gal/(d /H11080ft)) for larger
treatment plants (WEF and ASCE, 1991a). It is a general cons ensus that
substantially high weir loading rates will not impair p erformance.
The depth of secondary clarifiers is commonly designed as 4 to 5 m
(13 to 16 ft). The deeper tanks increase TSS removal and RAS concen -
tration as well as costs. Typically, the larger the tank diameter, the
deeper the sidewall depth. The shapes of settling tanks include rectan-
gular, circular, and square. A design example of a secondary  clarifierHRT 5 Q/A 5 24 3 ISV/CSFWastewater Engineering 741

an activated-sludge process with a recycle rate of 25%, an MLSS  concentra-
tion of 3600 mg/L, an average design flow of 22,710 m3/d (6 Mgal/d), and an
anticipated peak hourly flow of 53,000 m3/d (14 Mgal/d). Use solids loading

27 Efﬂuent Disinfection
Effluent disinfection is the last treatment step of a secondary or  terti-
ary treatment process. Disinfection is a chemical treatment m ethod
carried out by adding the selected disinfectant to an effluent t o destroy
or inactivate the disease-causing organisms. The purposes of effluen t
disinfection are to protect public health by killing or inac tivating path-
ogenic organisms such as enteric bacteria, viruses, and pr otozoans, and
to meet the effluent discharge standards.
The disinfection agents (chemicals) include chlorine, ozone, ultrav iolet
(UV) radiation, chlorine dioxide, and bromine. Design of UV irr adiation
can be referred to the manufacturer or elsewhere (WEF and ASCE, 1996 a).
The chlorination–dechlorination process is currently widely pr acticed
in the United States. Chlorine is added to a secondary effluent for a cer-
tain contact time (20 to 45 min for average flow and 15 min a t peak flow),
then the effluent is dechlorinated before discharge only during wa rm
weather when people use water as primary contact. In the Unit ed States
most states adopt a coliform limitation of 200 fecal coliform/100  ml.Wastewater Engineering 743
Chlorination of effluents is usually accomplished with liquid  chlo-
rine. Alternative methods use calcium or sodium hypochlorite or  chlo-
rine dioxide. Disinfection kinetics and chemistry of chlorinat ion are
discussed in Chapter 5, numerous literature, and textbooks. An excel-
lent review of effluent disinfection can be found in Design Manual
(US EPA, 1986).
27.1 Chlorine dosage
If a small quantity of chlorine is added to wastewater or effluen t, it will
react rapidly with reducing substances such as hydrogen sulfide and fer-
rous iron, and be destroyed. Under these conditions, there are no disin-
fection effects. If enough chlorine is added to react with all redu cing
compounds, then a little more added chlorine will react with organic
materials present in wastewater and form chlororganic compound s, which
have slight disinfection activities. Again, if enough chlori ne is introduced
to react with all reducing compounds and all organic mater ials, then a
little more chlorine added will react with ammonia or other ni trogenous
compounds to produce chloramines or other combined forms of chlorine,
which do have disinfection capabilities. Therefore chlorine dosage and
residual chlorine are very important factors of disinfection opera tion. In
addition to its disinfection purpose, chlorination is also ap plied for pre-
vention of wastewater decomposition, prechlorination of primary in fluent,
control of activated sludge bulking, and reduction of BOD.
Chlorinators are designed to have a capacity adequate to produ ce
an effluent to meet coliform density limits specified by the regula tory
agency. Usually, multiple units are installed for adequate capacity and
to prevent excessive chlorine residuals in the effluent. Table 6.2 1
shows the recommended chlorine dosing capacity for treating norm al

1997; GLUMRB, 1996).
For small applications, 150-lb (68-kg) chlorine cylinders are typically
used where chlorine gas consumption is less than 150 lb/d. Chlorine
cylinders are stored in an upright position with adequate s upport brack-
ets and chains at 2/3 of cylinder height for each cylinder. For larger
applications where the average daily chlorine gas consumption  is greater
than 150 lb, 1-ton (907-kg) containers are employed. Tank cars , usually
accompanied by evaporators, are used for large installations ( /H1102210
Mgal/d, 0.44 m3/s). In this case, area-wide public safety should be eval-
uated as part of the design consideration.
Example 1: Estimate a monthly supply of liquid chlorine for trickling filter
plant effluent disinfection. The design average flow of the plant is  3.0 Mgal/d
(11,360 m3/d).
solution:
Step 1. Find the recommended dosage
From Table 6.21, the recommended dosage for trickling filter plan t effluent
is 10 mg/L.
Step 2. Compute the daily consumption

The daily consumption is over 150 lb/d (68 kg/d); thus choose 1-ton (2000-lb,
907-kg) containers.
Step 3. Compute the number of 1-ton containers required for 1 month’ s (M)
supply
Monthly need /H11005250 lb/d /H1100330 d/M

The plant needs four 1-ton containers, which is enough for 1 month ’s
consumption.

27.2 Dechlorination
There have been concerns that wastewater disinfection may do more
harm than good due to the toxicity of disinfection by-products. Many
states have adopted seasonal chlorination (warm weather periods) in
addition to dechlorination. Dechlorination is important in c ases where
chlorinated wastewater comes into contact with fish and other aquatic
animals. Sulfur compounds, activated carbon, hydrogen peroxi de, and
ammonia can be used to reduce the residual chlorine in a disi nfected
wastewater prior to discharge. The first two are the most widely  used.
Sulfur compounds include sulfur dioxide (SO2), sodium metabisulfite
(NaS2O5), sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3), and sodium sulfite (Na2SO3).
Dechlorination reactions with those compounds are shown below.

The most common dechlorination chemicals are sulfur compounds, p ar-
ticularly sulfur dioxide gas, or aqueous solutions of bisulfit e or sulfite.
A pellet dechlorination system can be used for small plants. Li quid
sulfur dioxide gas cylinders are in 50 gal (190 L) drums.
Sulfur dioxide is a deadly gas that affects the central nervou s system.
It is colorless and nonflammable. When sulfur dioxide dissolves in water,
it forms sulfurous acid which is a strong reducing chemica l. As sulfur
dioxide is introduced to chlorinated effluent, it reduces all form s of chlo-
rine to chloride and converts sulfur to sulfate. Both by-product s, chlo-
rides and sulfates, occur commonly in natural waters.
Sodium metabisulfite is a cream-colored powder readily soluble in
water at various strengths. Sodium bisulfite is a white pow der, or in
granular form, and is available in solution with strength s up to 44%. Both
sodium metabisulfite and sodium bisulfite are safe chemicals. These are
most commonly used in small plants and in a few larger pla nts.
The dosage of dechlorination chemical depends on the chlorine resid-
ual in the effluent, the final residual chlorine standards, a nd the type of
dechlorinating chemical used. Theoretical requirements to neutra lize
1 mg/L of chlorine for sulfur dioxide (gas), sodium bisulfite, and  sodium
metabisulfite are 0.90, 1.46, and 1.34 mg/L, respectively. Theoretical
values may be employed for initial estimation for sizing dechlori nating
equipment under good mixing conditions. An extra 10% of dechlori nation
is designed above theoretical values. However, excess sulfur dioxid e may
consume dissolved oxygen at a maximum of 0.25 mg DO for every 1  mg
of sulfur dioxide. Since the sulfur dioxide reacts very rapidly  with the
chlorine residual, no additional contact time is necessary. Dechlorination
may remove all chlorine-induced toxicity from the effluents.
27.3 Process design
The design of an ozonation or ultraviolet irradiation system can usually
be provided by the manufacturers. Only chlorination is disc ussed in
this section.
Traditional design . The disinfection efficiency of effluent chlorination
depends on chlorine dosage, contact time, temperature, pH, and c har-
acteristics of wastewater such as TSS, nitrogen concentrations , and type
and density of organisms. The first two factors can be designed for the
best performance for chlorination of water and wastewater effluent. I nNH1

general, residual chlorine at 0.5 mg/L after 20 to 30 min of c ontact time
is required. The State of California requires a minimum of 30 mi n con-
tact time. The chlorine contact tank can be sized on the basis  of contact
time and plant flow. However, many engineers disagree with this  method.
Contact time is related to the configuration of the chlorine conta ct
tank. The drag on the sides of a deep, narrow tank causes relat ively poor
dispersion characteristics. Sepp (1977) observed that the dis persion
number usually decreases with increasing length-to-width ( L/W) ratios.
The depth-to-width ( D/W) ratio should be 1.0 or less in chlorine tanks.
Adequate baffling, reduction of side drag, and elimination of dea d spaces
can provide a reasonably long tank with adequate plug-flow hy draulics
(Sepp, 1981). Marske and Boyle (1973) claimed that adequate pl ug-flow
tanks can be achieved by L/Wratios of 40–70 to 1. In design, in addi-
tion to L/Wratios, the usual dispersion parameters and geometric con-
figurations must be considered.
Example: Determine the size of a chlorine contact tank for a design aver-
age flow of 0.131 m3/s (3 Mgal/d) and a peak flow of 0.329 m3/s (7.5 Mgal/d).

Collins–Selleck model. Traditionally, chlorination has been considered
as a first-order reaction that follows the theoretical Chick or
Chick–Watson model. However, in practice, it has been observed n ot to
be the case for wastewater chlorination. Collins et al. (1971) found that
initial mixing of the chlorine solution and wastewater has a  profound
effect on coliform bacteria reduction. The efficiency of wastewater chlo-
rination, as measured by coliform reduction, was related to th e residence
time. It was recommended that the chlorine contact tank be des igned
to approach plug-flow reactors with rapid initial mixing. Collins et al.
(1971) suggested that amperometric chlorine residuals and cont act time
could be used to predict the effluent coliform density.
Collins and Selleck (1972) found that the coliform bacteria sur vival
ratio often produces an initial log period and a declining ra te of inacti-
vation as a plot of the log survival ratio versus time (Fig. 6 .35a). After
the initial log period, there is a straight-line relationship  between log
survival and log of the product of chlorine residual concentrat ion Cand
contact time t(Fig. 6.35b).

Equation (6.164) applies to the lag period. Equation (6.165) p lots as a

values of band n, obtained from several researchers for various types
of chlorine applied to various stages of wastewaters with different  bac-
teria species, are summarized by J.M. Montgomery Engineers (198 5).
Wide variations of those values were observed. Collins and Selleck
(1972) found that the slope n/H11005/H110023 for ideal plug flow, n/H11005 /H110021.5 for
complete-mix flow, and bwas about 4 in a primary effluent.
Robert et al. (1980) stated that the Collins–Selleck model is a useful
empirical design tool although it has no rational mechanist ic basis in
describing chemical disinfection. Sepp (1977) recommended that the
design of chlorine disinfection systems should incorporate rapid  initial
mixing, reliable automatic chlorine residual control, and a dequate chlo-
rine contact in well-designed contact tanks.

chlorine to disinfect a secondary effluent. The results show that when b/H110052.87

28 Advanced Wastewater Treatment
Advanced wastewater treatment (AWT) refers to those additional treat -
ment techniques needed to further reduce suspended and dissolved s ub-
stances remaining after secondary treatment. It is also call ed tertiary
treatment. Secondary treatment removes 85% to 95% of BOD and TSS a nd
minor portions of nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metals. The pu rposes
of AWT are to improve the effluent quality to meet stringent effluent st an-
dards and to reclaim waste-water for reuse as a valuable water  resource.
The targets for removal by the AWT process include suspended solids ,
organic matter, nutrients, dissolved solids, refractory organ ics, and spe-
cific toxic compounds. More specifically, the common AWT processes  are
suspended solids removal, nitrogen control, and phosphorus remov al.
Suspended solids are removed by chemical coagulation and filtr ation.
Phosphorus removal is done to reduce eutrophication of receiving wat ers
from wastewater discharge. Ammonia is oxidized to nitrate to red uce its
toxicity to aquatic life and nitrogenous oxygen demand in the receiving
water bodies. 5  0.000359N

28.1 Suspended solids removal
Treatment techniques for the reduction of suspended solids in secon d-
ary effluents include chemical coagulation followed by gravity sedi-
mentation or dissolved air flotation, and physical strainin g or filtration
such as wedge-wire screens, microscreens, other screening devices,
diatomaceous earth filters, ultrafiltration, and granular m edia filters.
These treatment processes are discussed in Chapter 5. More detail ed
descriptions and practical applications for SS removal are given in the
US EPA’s manual (1975a). Chemical coagulants used for SS r emoval
include aluminum compounds, iron compounds, soda ash, caus tic soda,
carbon dioxide, and polymers. Some of the above processes are descri bed
in Chapter 5 and in other textbooks.
The use of a filtration process similar to that employed in drin king
water treatment plant can remove the residual SS, BOD, and microor-
ganisms from secondary effluent. Conventional sand filters or
granular-media filters for water treatment may serve as advanc ed
wastewater treatment and are discussed by Metcalf and Eddy,  Inc.
(1991). However, the filters may require more frequent backwashing.
Design surface loading rates for wastewater filtration usually  range
from 2.0 to 2.7 L/(m2/H11080s) (3 to 4 gal/(min /H11080ft2)). Filtration lasts about
24 h, and the effluent quality expected is 5 to 10 mg/L of susp ended
solids.
28.2 Phosphorus removal
The typical forms of phosphorus found in wastewater include the
orthophosphates, polyphosphates (molecularly dehydrated phosphat es),
and organic phosphates. Orthophosphates such as , , ,
H3PO4are available for biological uptake without further breakdown.
The polyphosphates undergo hydrolysis in aqueous solutions and revert
to the orthophosphate forms. This hydrolysis is a very slow proc ess.
The organic phosphorus is an important constituent of industr ial wastes
and less important in most domestic wastewaters.
The total domestic phosphorus contribution to wastewater is abou t
1.6 kg per person per year (3.5 lb per capita per year). The av erage total
phosphorus concentration in domestic raw wastewater is about 10 mg/L,
expressed as elemental phosphorus, P (US EPA, 1976). Approximat ely
30% to 50% of the phosphorus is from sanitary wastes, while the remain-
ing 70% to 50% is from phosphate builders in detergents.
Phosphorus is one of major contributors to eutrophication of receiv-
ing waters. Removal of phosphorus is a necessary part of pollut ion pre-
vention to reduce eutrophication. In most cases, the effluent stan dards
range from 0.1 to 2.0 mg/L as P, with many established at 1.0 mg/L.
Percentage reduction requirements range from 80% to 95%.H2PO2

Chemical precipitation. Phosphorus removal can be achieved by chemi-
cal precipitation or a biological method. In practice, phosp horus in waste-
water is removed by chemical precipitation with metal salt (aluminum
or iron) or/and polymer, or lime. The chemical can be dosed before pr i-
mary sedimentation, in the trickling filter, in the activa ted sludge
process, and in the secondary classifier. Aluminum ions can  flocculate
phosphate ions to form aluminum phosphate which then precipit ates:
Al3/H11001/H11001:AlPO4p/H11001nH/H11001(6.166)
Alum, Al2(SO4)3/H1108014H2O, is most commonly used as a source of alu-
minum. The precipitation reactions for phosphorus removal by th ree
chemical additions are as follows:
Alum:
Al2(SO4)3/H1108014H2O /H11001
(6.167)
Sodium aluminate:

Alum and ferric chloride decrease the pH while lime increases pH.  The
optimum pH for alum and ferric chloride is between 5.5 and 6.0 . The
effective pH for lime is above 10.0. Theoretically, 9.6 g of alum is  required
to remove 1 g of phosphorus. However, there is an excess alum requir e-
ment due to the competing reactions with natural alkalinity . The alka-
linity reaction is
Al2(SO4)3/H11080 18H2O /H110016HCO3/H11002S2Al(OH)3T/H110013SO2
4/H11002/H110016CO2/H1100118H2O
(6.172)
As a result, the requirement of alum to remove phosphorus demands
weight ratios of approximately 13:1, 16:1, and 22:1 for 75%,  85%, and
95% phosphorus removal, respectively (from Eqs. (6.167) and (6.17 2)).2HPO22

The molar ratio of ferric ion to orthophosphate is 1 to 1. Similar ly to
alum, a greater amount of iron is required to precipitate phosp horus and
to react with alkalinity in wastewater. Its competing reac tion with nat-
ural alkalinity is
FeCl2/H11080 6H2O /H11001 SFe(OH)3T/H110013Cl–/H110013CO2/H110016H2O (6.173)
The stoichiometric weight ratios of Fe:P is 1.8:1. Weight ratio of lime
(CaO) to phosphorus is 2.2:1. The reaction of Eq. (6.173) is slow .
Therefore, lime or some other alkali may be added to raise the pH and
supply hydroxyl ion for better coagulation. The reaction is
2FeCl3/H110806H2O /H110013Ca(OH)2S2Fe(OH)3T /H110013CaCl2/H1100112H2O (6.174)
Both ferric (Fe3/H11001) and ferrous (Fe2/H11001) ions are used in the precipitation
of phosphorus. Ferrous sulfate application for phosphorus removal i s
similar to that of ferric sulfate.
Calcium ion reacts with phosphate ion in the presence of hydrox yl ion
to form hydroxyapatite. Lime usually comes in a dry form, calc ium
oxide. It must be mixed with water to form a slurry (calcium  hydroxide,
Ca(OH)2) in order to be fed to a wastewater. Equipment required for lime
precipitation includes a lime-feed device, mixing chamber, sett ling tank,
and pumps and piping.
Phosphorus removal in primary and secondary plants. In conventional pri-
mary and secondary treatment of wastewater, phosphorus removal is
only sparingly undertaken because the majority of phosphorus i n
wastewater is in soluble form. Primary sedimentation removes only
5% to 10% of phosphorus. Secondary biological treatment removes
10% to 20% of phosphorus by biological uptake. The effectiveness of
primary and secondary treatment without (as in most conventi onal
plants) and with chemical addition for phosphorus removal as  well as
for SS and BOD removals is presented in Table 6.22. Generally , the3HCO2

total phosphorus concentration of 10 mg/L in the raw wastewater  is
reduced to about 9 mg/L in the primary effluent and to 8 mg/L i n the
secondary effluent.
Example 1: Alum is added in the aeration basin of a conventional activa ted-
sludge process for phosphorus removal. The effluent limit for total p hosphorus
is 0.5 mg/L. The alum is dosed at 140 mg/L. The average total phosphorus con-

Notes : In practice, the actual FeCl3dose would be 1.5 to 3.0 times the stoi-
chiometric amount. Likewise, the alum dose would be 1.3 to 2.5 times the sto-
ichiometric amount due to side reaction, solubility products limitations, and
wastewater quality variations. Jar tests on wastewater are needed for deter-
mining the actual amount.Wastewater Engineering 759
Phosphorus removal by mineral addition to secondary effluent. Generally,
an alum dosage of about 200 mg/L is required for phosphorus remov al
from typical municipal raw wastewater and a dosage of 50 to 100 mg/L
is sufficient for secondary effluent. Iron salts have little appl ication
because of residual iron remaining in the treated wastewater. A n Al : P
molar ratio of 1 : 1 to 2 : 1 is required. The optimum pH for al um
treatment is near 6.0, whereas that for iron is near 5.0 (Rech t and
Ghassemi, 1970). The pH of high alkalinity waters may be redu ced
either by using high dosages of alum or by adding supplement ary
dosages of sulfuric acid. Anionic polyelectrolytes (coagulant ai ds) can
be used to enhance P removal. If higher phosphorus removal is
required, a filtration process must be used to achieve 0.1 mg/ L of
residual P.
The surface overflow rates for settling tanks range from 24 to 58
m3/(m2/H11080 d) (580 to 1440 gal/(d /H11080 ft2)). Filtration rates are 0.08 to 0.20
m3/(m2/H11080 min) (2 to 5 gal/(min /H11080 ft2)) (US EPA, 1976).
Example: Estimate the daily liquid alum requirement for phosphorus
removal from the secondary effluent which has an average design fl ow of
1 Mgal/d (3785 m3/d) and an average phosphorus concentration of 8 mg/L.
Assume that the specific weight of alum is 11.1 lb/gal and  alum contains
4.37% of aluminum.

Phosphorus removal by lime treatment of secondary efﬂuent. For phosphorus
removal, lime can be added to the primary sedimentation tank and to
the secondary effluent. Lime treatment of wastewater is essentially the
same process as is used for lime softening of drinking water, bu t with a
different purpose. While softening may occur, the primary objectiv e is
to remove phosphorus by precipitation as hydroxyapatite (Eq. (6 .171)).
During phosphorus precipitation, a competing reaction of lime with
alkalinity will occur. This reaction results in calcium removal, an action
of softening which has a very important effect on the phosphorus
removal efficiency of the process. This reaction may occur in two w ays:
Ca(OH)2/H11001Ca(HCO3)2S2CaCO3T /H110012H2O (6.175)
Ca(OH)2/H11001NaHCO3SCaCO3T /H11001NaOH /H11001H2O (6.176)
Another reaction may occur to precipitate magnesium hydroxide:
Mg2/H11001/H110012OH–SMg(OH)2T (6.177)
In the two-stage lime treatment process, recarbonation after the fi rst
stage is required to reduce the pH and to precipitate excess lim e as cal-
cium carbonate by adding carbon dioxide. The chemical reacti on is
Ca2/H11001/H11001CO2/H110012OH–SCaCO3/H11001H2O (6.178)
Lime can be added to secondary effluent by single-stage or two-stage
treatment. For the single-stage process (Fig. 6.36), lime is mixed  with
feed wastewater to raise the pH (10–11); this is then followed by fl oc-
culation and sedimentation. The clarified water is adjusted t o lower pH
with carbon dioxide and is filtered through a multimedia fil ter to pre-
vent postprecipitation of calcium carbonate before discharge. The set-
tled lime sediment may be disposed of to a landfill or may be rec alcined
for recovery of lime. In recovery, the sediment is thickened, dewater ed
by centrifuge or vacuum filter, calcined, and then reused.Liquid alum required 5116.1  lb/d

For a typical two-stage process (Fig. 6.37), in the first-stage c larifier
of the two-stage process, sufficient lime is dosed to raise the pH ab ove
11 to precipitate the soluble phosphorus as hydroxyapatite, c alcium car-
bonate, and magnesium hydroxide.
The calcium carbonate precipitate formed in the process acts as  a
coagulant for suspended solids removal. The excess soluble calciu m is
removed in the second clarifier as a calcium carbonate precipi tate by
adding carbon dioxide gas to reduce the pH to about 10. The cal cium car-
bonate settles out in the secondary (or tertiary) clarifier. To rem ove the
residual levels of phosphorus and suspended solids, the secondar y (or
tertiary) clarified effluent is filtered, then discharged. Usual ly pH is
reduced to about 8.0 and 8.5 in first-stage recarbonation and  further
reduced to 7.0 in second-stage recarbonation. Fifteen minutes’ conta ct

Phosphorus removal by biological processes. Numerous biological meth-
ods of removing phosphorus have been developed. Integrated biological
processes for nutrient removal from wastewater use a combination of
biological and chemical methods to bring phosphorus and nit rogen con-
centrations to below the effluent standards. Some patented (17 year s)
integrated biological processes have been installed in the Unit ed States.
The A/O process (Fig. 6.38) for mainstream P removal, Phostrip proc ess

Biological processes for nutrient removal feature the exposure of alter -
nate anaerobic and aerobic conditions to the microorganisms so that their
uptake of phosphorus will be above normal levels. Phosphorus is n ot only
utilized for cell synthesis, maintenance, and energy transport , but is also
stored for subsequent use by the microorganisms. The sludge produ ced con-
taining phosphorus is either wasted or removed through a sides tream
(return sludge stream). The alternate exposure of the microorganisms  to
anaerobic and aerobic (oxic) conditions in the main biological treatment
is called the mainstream process. A design example (Ex. 15.2) is illustratedFigure 6.46 Ludzack–Ettinger process for nitrogen removal.

28.3 Nitrogen control
Nitrogen (N) in wastewater exists commonly in the form of organic,
ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and gaseous nitrogen. The organic nitrogen
includes both soluble and particulate forms. The soluble organi c nitro-
gen is mainly in the form of urea and amino acids. The main s ources are
from human excreta, kitchen garbage, and industrial (food proc essing)
wastes. Typical domestic wastewater contains 20 mg/L of organ ic nitro-
gen and 15 mg/L of inorganic nitrogen.
Environmental effects. Nitrogen compounds, particularly ammonia, will
exert a significant oxygen demand through biological nitrific ation and
may cause eutrophication in receiving waters. Ammonia (unioni zed)
can be toxic to aquatic organisms and it readily reacts w ith chlorine
(affecting disinfection efficiency). A high nitrate (NO3) level in water sup-
plies has been reported to cause methemoglobinemia in infants. The
need for nitrogen control in wastewater effluents has generally been
recognized.
Treatment process. Many treatment processes have been developed
with the specific purpose of transforming nitrogen compounds or r emov-
ing nitrogen from the wastewater stream.
Conventional processes. In conventional treatment processes, the con-
centration of inorganic nitrogen is not affected by primary sedi men-
tation and is increased more than 50% to 24 mg/L after secondar y
(biological) treatment. The overall primary and secondary treatm ent
removes 25% to 75% (5 to 15 mg/L) of organic nitrogen. Typically,
about 14% and 26% of total nitrogen from raw wastewater are
removed by conventional primary and secondary treatment process es,
respectively.
Biological processes remove particulate organic nitrogen and tr ans-
form some to ammonium and other inorganic forms. A fraction of the
ammonium present will be assimilated into organic materials  of cells.
Soluble organic nitrogen is partially transformed to ammonium  by
microorganisms, with 1 to 3 mg/L of organic nitrogen remainin g insol-
uble in the secondary effluent.
Advanced processes. Advanced wastewater treatment processes
designed to remove wastewater constituents other than nitrogen oftenremove some nitrogen compounds as well. Removal is usually limi ted
to particulate forms, and the removal efficiency is not high.
Tertiary filtration removes the suspended organic nitrogen from t he
secondary effluent. However the majority of nitrogen is inorganic
(ammonium). Reverse osmosis and electrodialysis can be used as a  ter-
tiary process for ammonium removal. Their effectiveness is 80% and
40%, respectively. In practice, RO and electrodialysis are n ot used for
wastewater treatment.
Chemical coagulation for phosphorus removal also removes particu -
late organic nitrogen. The process for nitrogen control may be div ided
into two categories, i.e. nitrification and nitrification–deni trification,
depending on the quality requirements of wastewater effluent. The
nitrification process is the oxidation of organic and ammonia nitro-
gen (NH3-N) to nitrate, a less objectionable form; it is merely the con-
version of nitrogen from one form to another form in the wastewater.
Denitrification is the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas, co nstitut-
ing a removal of nitrogen from wastewater. Nitrification is used  only
to control NH3-N concentration in the wastewater. Nitrification–
denitrification is employed to reduce the total level of nitrogen i n the
effluent.
There are several methods of nitrogen control. They are biological
nitrification–denitrification, break-point chlorination, select ive ion
exchange, and air (ammonia) stripping. This section is main ly devoted
to biological nitrification or biological technologies, since mos t processes
have been discussed previously in Chapter 5.
Biological nitrification can be achieved in separate stage pr ocesses
following secondary treatment (most cases) or in combination for
carbon oxidation–nitrification and for carbon oxidation–nitri fication–
denitrification. The secondary effluent with its high ammonia c on-
tent and low BOD provides greater growth potential for the nitr ifiers
relative to the heterotrophic bacteria. The nitrification process is
operated at an increased sludge age to compensate for lower tem-
perature. After the nitrifiers have oxidized the ammonia in the a er-
ation tank, the activated sludge containing a large  fraction of nitrifiers
is settled in the final clarifier for return to the aeration tan k and for
waste.
Nitriﬁcation reaction. Biological nitrification is an aerobic autotrophic
process in which the energy for bacterial growth is derived from  the oxi-
dation of inorganic compounds, primarily ammonia nitrogen. A utotrophic
nitrifiers, in contrast to heterotrophs, use inorganic carbon dioxide
instead of organic carbon for cell synthesis. The yield of nitrifi er cells per
unit of substrate metabolized is many times smaller than tha t for het-
erotrophic bacteria.Wastewater Engineering 773774 Chapter 6
Although a variety of nitrifying bacteria exist in nature, the two
genera associated with biological nitrification are Nitrosomonas and
Nitrobacter. The oxidation of ammonia to nitrate is a two-step process
requiring both nitrifiers for the conversion. Nitrosomonas oxidizes
ammonia to nitrite, while Nitrobacter subsequently transforms nitrite
to nitrate. The respective oxidation reactions are as follows:
Ammonia oxidation:
/H110011.5O2/H110012HC N /H110012H2CO3/H11001H2O (6.179) 
Nitrite oxidation:
N /H110010.5O2 N (6.180)
Overall reaction:
/H110012O2/H110012HC /H110012H2CO3/H11001H2O (6.181)
Note: The above three equations are essentially the same as Eqs. (1. 87),
(1.88), and (1.89), respectively.
To oxidize 1 mg/L of NH3-N, theoretically 4.56 mg/L of oxygen is
required when synthesis of nitrifiers is neglected. As ammonia is
oxidized and bicarbonate is utilized; nitrate is formed and ca rbonic
acid is produced. The carbonic acid will further depress the pH of the
wastewater. Theoretically, alkalinity of 7.14 mg/L CaCO3is con-
sumed for each mg/L of NH3-N oxidized. The destruction of alkalin-
ity and increase of carbonic acid results in a drop in pH of the
wastewater.
Reviews of the synthesis and energy relationship associated wit h
biological nitrification are available elsewhere (Painter, 1970,  1975;
Haug and McCarty, 1972; US EPA, 1975). Overall oxidation  and
synthesis–oxidation reactions of ammonia are presented below (US

Nitrifying bioﬁlm properties. Although the principal genera Nitrosomonas
and Nitrobacter are responsible for biological nitrification, het-
erotrophic nitrification can also occur when nitrite and/or n itrate are
produced from organic or inorganic compounds by heterotrophic org an-
isms ( /H11022100 species, including fungi). However, the amount of oxida-
tion nitrogen formed by heterotrophic organisms is relatively sm all
(Painter, 1970).
The growth rate for nitrifying bacteria is much less than of h et-
erotrophic bacteria. Nitrifying bacteria have a longer generat ion time
of at least 10 to 30 h (Painter, 1970, 1975). They are also muc h more
sensitive to environmental conditions as well as to growth inh ibitors.
The growth rate for nitrite oxidizers is much greater than that  for the
ammonia oxidizers.
According to Painter (1970), experimental yield values of Nitrosomonas
lay between 0.04 and 0.13 lb volatile suspended solids (VSS) grown per
pound of ammonia nitrogen oxidized; and for Nitrobacter the yield ranged
from 0.02 to 0.07 lb VSS per pound of nitrite nitrogen oxidized.  Yield
values based on thermodynamic theory are 0.29 and 0.084, res pectively
for Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter (Haug and McCarty, 1972). The lower
value of the experimental yield is due to the diversion of a portion  of the
free energy released by oxidation to microorganism maintenance func -
tions. Based on Eqs. (6.182) and (6.183), the yield for Nitrosomonas and
Nitrobacter should be 0.15 mg cells/mg -N and 0.02 mg cells/mg
NO2-N, respectively.
Kinetics of nitriﬁcation. The kinetics of biological nitrification, using
mathematical expressions for the oxidation of ammonia and nitri te,
have been proposed by many investigators. A variety of environment al
factors, such as ammonia concentration, pH, temperature, and dis-
solved oxygen level, affect the kinetics. For the combined carbon
oxidation–nitrification processes, BOD to TKN ratio is also an  important
factor. The reaction is enhanced with higher pH, higher temperat ure,
and higher DO concentration.
Effect of ammonia concentration on kinetics. Numerous investigators have
developed growth kinetics and substrate utilization equations for nitri-
fiers. However, the most popular method is the Monod model (1949) ofNH1

population dynamics. The growth rate of nitrifiers is a functi on of
ammonia concentration dynamics, as follows:
(6.185)
where /H11005growth rate of nitrifier, per day
/H11005maximum specific growth rate of nitrifier, per day

t/H11005time, days
Ks/H11005half velocity constant, i.e. substrate concentration (mg/L)
at half of the maximum growth rate
Equation (6.185) assumes no mass transfer or oxygen transfer
limitations.
Values of Ksfor Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter are generally equal to
or less than 1 mg/L (0.18 to 1.0 mg/L mostly) at liquid temp eratures of
20/H11034C or less (Haug and McCarty, 1972). The Monod expression for bio-
logical nitrification provides for a continuous transition bet ween first-
and zero-order kinetics based on substrate concentration. Since Ksvalues
for nitrification are much less than ammonia concentrations fou nd in
wastewater, many investigators (Huang and Hopson, 1974, Wild  et al.,
1971; Kiff, 1972) found that the growth kinetic model reduces t o a zero-
order expression
(6.186)
Equation (6.186) indicates that the nitrification rate is i ndependent of
the initial substrate concentration and the mixing regime. This suggests
that nitrifiers are reproducing at or near their maximum gr owth rate.
As substrate is removed, and as Sapproaches the value of Ksor less,
further substrate removal will begin to approximate a first-ord er
reaction.
Estimates of the maximum growth rates ( ) of Nitrosomonas and
Nitrobacter under various environmental conditions, found by other
investigators, are summarized elsewhere (US EPA, 1975c; Brenner
et al. , 1984). Both and Ksare found to increase with increasing tem-
perature. All nitrification studies were conducted with acti vated-sludge
processes or river waters. Maximum growth rates might be expec ted to
approximate those of suspended growth process in which ammonia mass
transfer and DO are not limiting.mˆmˆm51

The ranges and typical values of kinetic coefficients for suspended
growth nitrification processes using pure cultures are summa rized in
Table 6.23. In practice, the values of those coefficients for nitr ifiers in
activated-sludge processes will be considerably less than the values
listed in the table.
The reported data indicate that the maximum growth rate of
Nitrobacter is considerably greater than that of Nitrosomonas .
Therefore the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite is the rate-limiting r eac-
tion in nitrification. For this reason, nitrite does not accum ulate in
large amounts in mature nitrification systems for municipal  waste-
waters.
Oxidation rate. The ammonia oxidation rate is related to the Nitrosomonas
growth rate. Its maximum oxidation rate can be expressed as

4Loading rate. Referring to Eqs. (6.185) and (6.187), the growth rate of
nitrifier is proportional to substrate (NH3-N) concentration. The ammo-
nia loading rates applied to the biological nitrification un it (aeration
tank) are 160 to 320 g/(m3/H11080d) (10 to 20 lb/(1000 ft3/H11080 d)) with corre-
sponding wastewater temperature of 10 to 20 /H11034C, respectively. The aer-
ation periods are 4 to 6 h for an average wastewater secondary effl uent
(Hammer, 1986).
BOD concentration. The combined process oxidizes a high proportion of
the influent organics (SBOD5) relative to the NH3-N concentration,
while less nitrifiers are present in the biofilm. Separate nitr ification
processes have relatively low SBOD5values, relative to the NH3-N con-
tent, when a high level of SBOD5removal is provided prior to the nitri-
fication stages. High populations of nitrifiers occur in the sep arate-stage
nitrification process.
In combined carbon oxidation–nitrification processes the ratio of BOD
to TKN is greater than 5, whereas in separate processes the BOD  to TKN
ratio in the second stage is greater than 1 and less than 3 . Reducing the
ratio to 3 does not require a high degree of treatment in the first  stage
(US EPA, 1975b; McGhee, 1991).
Biological nitrification is sensitive to organic loading, dep ending on
the carbon removal sections, because of the nitrifiers having a much
slower growth rate. Nitrification will take place when organi c content
is reduced to a certain level. There are discrepancies about wha t is the
critical concentration for organic matter. The values cited in  the litera-
ture are as follows: TBOD5approaching 30 mg/L (Antonie, 1978; Khan
and Raman, 1980); TBOD5reaching 20 mg/L (Banerji, 1980); SBOD5less
than 20 mg/L (Autotrol Corp, 1979); SBOD5reduced to 15 mg/L; SBOD5
around 10 mg/L (Miller et al., 1980).
Temperature. The optimum range for nitrification is 30 to 36 /H11034C (Haug
and McCarty, 1972; Ford et al., 1980). Nitrifiers have been found not to
grow at temperatures below 4 /H11034C or above 45 /H11034C (Ford et al., 1980).
In a suspended-growth activated-sludge system, Downing and Hop wood
(1964) found that the maximum growth and the half-velocity cons tant
KNfor both Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter were markedly influenced by
temperature. The relationships developed for Nitrosomonas are as follows:

where T is the wastewater temperature, /H11034C.mˆ50.47e0.098sT215d,mˆ778 Chapter 6For attached-growth systems, different temperature effects have been
reported. Attached-growth systems have an advantage in withs tanding
low temperature ( /H1102115/H11034C) without as severe a loss of nitrification rates
as suspended-growth systems.
The following equation describes temperature effects on nitrification
rate at a temperature T, /H11034C
(6.190)
where T is wastewater temperature, /H11034C and uis a temperature correc-
tion coefficient. From laboratory and pilot RBC studies, the val ue of u
is found to be 1.10 (Mueller et al., 1980).
Dissolved oxygen. When dissolved oxygen concentration is a limiting
factor, the growth rate of nitrifiers can be expressed as following  the
Monod-type relationships as follows:
(6.191)
where is the half-saturation constant for oxygen in mg/L. Values  of
have been reported to vary from 0.15 mg/L at 15 /H11034C to 2.0 mg/L at
20/H11034C (US EPA, 1975b).
Alkalinity and pH. From stoichiometry (Eq. (6.181)), 7.14 mg/L of alka-
linity as CaCO3will be destroyed for every one mg/L of NH3-N oxi-
dized. However, Sherrard (1976) claimed this value to be in error and
suggested that it should be less for biological nitrification,  because
ammonia is incorporated into the biomass resulting in a less er quan-
tity of NH3-N available for oxidation to nitrate. The alkalinity destruc-
tion in a nitrifying activated sludge process is a function  of solids
retention time and influent wastewater BOD5:N:P ratio. Alleman and
Irving (1980) observed a considerably low value (2.73 mg/L of al kalinity
as CaCO3per mg/L of NH3-N oxidized) for nitrification in a sequential
batch reactor.
With the RBC system at Cadillac, Michigan, alkalinity  declined 8.1
mg/L for each mg/L of NH3-N oxidized (Singhal, 1980; Chou et al., 1980).
At Princeton, Illinois, the alkalinity reduction ratios were respectively
6.8 and 9.1 for stages 3 and 4 in a combined BOD5-nitrification 5-stage
RBC system (Lin et al. , 1982). Therefore it is important to have suffi-
cient alkalinity buffering capacity for nitrifiers to mainta in the accept-
able pH range.
Reported data show a wide range of optimum pH of 7.0 to 9.5 with
maximum activity at approximately pH 8.5 (Painter, 1970, 1975; HaugKO2KO2mN5mˆNaDO
KO21DObmT5m20uT220Wastewater Engineering 779and McCarty, 1972; Antonie, 1978). Below pH 7.0, adverse effect s on
ammonia oxidation become pronounced.
Full-scale kinetic studies conducted at the Autotrol Corporation  (1979)
showed that the nitrification rate declined from 0.31 lb NH3-N/(d /H110801000 ft2)
(1.52 g NH3-N/(m2/H11080 d)) at pH 7.0 to 0.17 lb/(d /H11080 1000 ft2) (0.83 g/(m2/H11080 d))
at pH 6.5.
Downing and Hopwood (1964) proposed the following relationship for
the growth rate for nitrifiers and pH values up to 7.2 in a c ombined
carbon oxidation and nitrification system.
[1 – 0.833(6.2 – pH)] (6.192)
It is assumed that the growth rate is constant for pH levels between 7.2
and 8.0. Eq. (6.192), when applied to separate-stage nitrific ation systems,
is probably conservative.
Combined kinetics expression. As previously presented, the major factors
which affect the nitrification rate are ammonia nitrogen concent ration,
temperature, DO, and pH. In the absence of toxic or inhibitory sub-
stance in the wastewater, US EPA (1975b) applied Chen’s model (1970)
which combined Monod’s expression for ammonia-N concentration
(Eq. (6.185)), DO (Eq. (6.191)), and pH (Eq. (6.192)) effects on nit rifier
growth as follows:
(6.193a)
Substituting the effects of temperature (Eq. (6.188)), Eq. (6.189) for KN,
1.3 mg/L for , the following equation is valid for Nitrosomonas for pH
/H110217.2 and wastewater temperature between 8 and 30 /H11034C
(6.193b)
[1 – 0.833(6.2 – pH)]
The terms in the first bracket represent the effect of temperature. The
second bracket terms are the Monod expression for the effect of NH3-
N concentration. The terms in the third bracket take into acc ount
the effect of DO. The terms in the last bracket account for the effect
of pH: it will be unity for pH /H113507.2. From Eq. (6.193) it can be seen
that if any one factor becomes limiting, even if all the others a re non-
limiting, the nitrification rate will be much lower, perhap s even
approaching zero.mN50.47[e0.098sT215d]cN

mix activated-sludge process.
Step 11. Estimate the total quantity of oxygen supply needed
The total quantity of oxygen required can be estimated on the bas is of oxygen
demand for BOD5and TKN removal and net mass of volatile solids (cells) pro-
duced with conversion factors. A procedure similar to the one ill ustrated in
the section on the activated-sludge process may be used.
Alternatively, a rough estimation can be calculated by the following equation

Step 13. Check the buffering capacity of the wastewater
Theoretically 7.14 mg/L of alkalinity as CaCO3is destroyed per mg/L of
NM/H11001
4-N oxidized. The alkalinity remaining after nitrification would  be at least
Alk. /H11005190 mg/L – 7.14 (15 mg/L)
/H1100583 mg/L as CaCO3
This should be sufficient to maintain the pH value in the aerat ion tanks
above 7.2.
Combined carbon oxidation–nitriﬁcation in attached growth reactors. Two
attached growth reactors, the trickling filter process and t he RBC
process, can be used for combined carbon oxidation–nitrification .uc5VX
QwaX1QeXe786 Chapter 6Detailed design procedures for these two processes are described else-
where (US EPA, 1975c) and in the manufacturers’ design manua l.
In the design of nitrification with trickling filters, the t otal surface
area required is determined on the basis of empirical unit sur face area
for unit NH/H11001
4-N oxidized per day under the BOD/TKN and the sustained
temperature conditions. The choice of filter media is based on the effl u-
ent BOD5and SS requirements. A circulation rate of 1:1 is usually
adequate.
Nitriﬁcation with RBC system. For a combined oxidation–nitrification
process with the RBC system, a two-step design procedure is need ed.
Significant nitrification will not occur in the RBC process  until the sol-
uble BOD concentration is reduced to 15 mg/L or less (Autotrol, 1979).
In the first design the media surface area required to reduce SB OD is
determined as shown in the example illustrated in the previous  section.
For influent ammonia nitrogen concentrations of 15 mg/L or above, i t
is necessary to reduce SBOD concentrations to less than 15 mg /L, i.e.
to about the same value as the ammonia nitrogen concentration. The
second design uses the nitrification design curves (Fig. 6.50) to deter-
mine the RBC area to reduce the influent ammonia nitrogen level t o
the required effluent concentration. The sum of the two RBC surface
areas is determined as the total surface area required for the com binedWastewater Engineering 787

for RBC carbon oxidization–nitrification of municipal wastewat er. If the
wastewater temperature is less than 55 /H11034F (12.8 /H11034C), a separate tempera-
ture correction should be made to each of the surface areas determin ed.

Denitriﬁcation. Biological denitrification is the conversion of nitrate to
gaseous nitrogen species and to cell material by the ubiquitou s hetero-
trophic facultative aerobic bacteria and some fungi. Denitrifi ers include a
broad group of bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Archromobacter,
and Bacillus (US EPA, 1975b). These groups of organisms can use either
nitrate or oxygen as electron acceptor (hydrogen donor) for conversion
of nitrate to nitrogen gas. Denitrification occurs in both aerob ic and
anoxic conditions. An anaerobic condition in the liquid is not necessary
for denitrification, and 1 to 2 mg/L of DO does not influence denit rifi-
cation. The term anoxic is preferred over anaerobic when describin g
the process of denitrification.
The conversion of nitrate to gaseous end products is a two-step
process, called dissimilatory denitrification, with a series  of enzymatic
reactions. The first step is a conversion of nitrate to nitrite, and the second
step converts the nitrite to nitrogen gas. The nitrate dissimi lations are
expressed as follows (Stanier et al., 1963)
2NO3/H110024e/H11002/H110014H/H11001S2NO2/H11002/H110012H2O (6.194)

For each molecule of nitrate reduced, five electrons can be accepted.
When methanol (CH3OH) is used on the organic carbon sources, the dis-
similatory denitrification can be expressed as follows:
First step

the electron donor.
When methanol is used as an organic carbon source in the conver sion
of nitrate to cell material, a process termed assimilatory (or s ynthesis)
denitrification, the stoichiometric equation is
3NO3/H11002/H1100114CH3OH /H110014H2CO3→3C5H7O2N /H1100120H2O /H110013HCO3/H11002(6.200)
From Eq. (6.200), neglecting cell synthesis, 1.9 mg of methanol  is
required for each mg of NO3-N reduction (M/N ratio). Including synthesis
results in an increase in the methanol requirement to 2.47 mg . The
total methanol requirement can be calculated from that required  for
nitrate and nitrite reductions and deoxygenation as follows (Mc Carty

In general, an M/N ratio of 2.5 to 3.0 is sufficient for complet e deni-
trification (US EPA, 1975c). A commonly used design value for t he
required methanol dosage is 3 mg/L per mg/L of NO3-N to be reduced.

and biomass generated for complete denitrification of an influent w ith a

Kinetics of denitriﬁcation. Similarly to nitrification, environmental fac-
tors affect the kinetic rate of denitrifier growth and nitrate rem oval.
These factors are mentioned in the previous section.

as follows:

Denitriﬁcation with RBC process. The RBC process has been applied to
biological denitrification by completely submerging the rotati ng media
and by adding an appropriate source of organic carbon. Figur e 6.52 is
a schematic process flow diagram of carbon oxidation–nitrifica tion–
denitrification. Methanol is added to the denitrification stag e, in which
the rotational speed is reduced. Methanol requirements are a sig nificant
portion of the operating cost. In a completely submerged mode, RBC  will
remove nitrate nitrogen at a rate of approximately 1 lb/(d /H110801000 ft2)
while treating influent nitrate concentrations up to 25 mg/L and pro-
ducing effluent nitrate nitrogen concentrations below 5 mg/L. The design
curves for RBC denitrification of municipal wastewater are pres ented
in Fig. 6.53 (Autotrol, 1979).
Denitrification is a relatively rapid reaction compared to ni trifica-
tion. It is generally more economical to reduce nitrate nitrogen to as low
a level as can be achieved by the RBC process, i.e. /H113491.0 mg/L.
Example: Design a denitrification RBC system following organic oxidati on–
nitrification, using data for the example in the section on ni trification with
the RBC system. The treatment plant is designed to produce a final  effluent of
4 mg/L total nitrogen (2 mg/L of NH3-N, 3 mg/L of TKN, and 1 mg/L of NO3-N).

29 Sludge (Residuals) Treatment
and Management
Residuals is a term currently used to refer to “sludge.” The bu lk of resid-
uals (sludge) generated from wastewater by physical primary a nd bio-
logical (secondary) and advanced (tertiary) treatment processes m ust be
treated and properly disposed of. The higher the degree of wastewater
treatment, the larger the quantity of sludge to be treated and handled.
With the advent of strict rules and regulations involving t he handling
and disposal of sludge, the need for reducing the volume of sludge has
become increasingly important in order to reduce the operating c osts
(approximately 50% of the plant costs) of wastewater treatment pla nts.
Sludge treatment and disposal is a complex problem facing wa stewater
treatment professionals. A properly designed and efficiently operated
sludge processing and disposal system is essential to the over all success
of the wastewater treatment effort.
29.1 Quantity and characteristics of sludge
The quantity and characteristics of the sludge produced depend  on the
character of raw wastewater and the wastewater treatment proces ses.
In the United States, approximately 12,750 public owned tr eatment
works (POTW) generate 5.4 million dry metric tons of sludge annual ly,
or 21 kg (47 lb) of dry sewage sludge (biosolids) per person (Federal
Register, 1993). 55.4 suse 6 shafts d 5540,000 ft2

7.45 gal/sd#ft2d796 Chapter 6Some estimates of the amounts of solids generated by the treatment
unit processes may be inferred from previous examples. Grit collec ted
from the preliminary treatment units is not biodegradable. It  is usually
transported to a sanitary landfill without further treatment .
Characteristics of wastewater sludges, including total soli ds and volatile
solids contents, pH, nutrients, organic matter, pathogens, m etals, organic
chemicals, and hazardous pollutants, are discussed in deta il elsewhere
(Federal Register, 1993; US EPA, 1995).
Sludge from primary settling tanks contains from 3% to 7% soli ds
which are approximately 60% to 80% organic (Davis and Cornwel l,
1991; Federal Register, 1993). Primary sludge solids are usua lly gray
in color, slimy, fairly coarse, and with highly obnoxious od ors. Primary
sludge is readily digested under suitable operational conditi ons (organ-
ics are decomposed by bacteria). Table 6.24 provides the solids  concen-
trations of primary sludge and sludge produced in different bi ological
treatment systems.
Sludge from secondary settling tanks has commonly a brownish , floc-
culant appearance and an earthy odor. If the color is dark, the sludge
may be approaching a septic condition. Secondary sludge cons ists mainly
of microorganisms (75% to 90% organic) and inert materials. The or ganic
matter may be assumed to have a specific gravity of 1.01 to 1 .06, depend-
ing on its source, whereas the inorganic particles have a sp ecific grav-
ity of 2.5 (McGhee, 1991).
In general, secondary sludges are more flocculant than primar y
sludge solids, less fibrous. Waste activated sludge usually  contains
0.5% to 2% solids, whereas trickling filter sludge has 2% to 5 % solids
(Davis and Cornwell, 1991; Hammer, 1986). Activated sludge and trick-
ling filter sludge can be digested readily, either alone or when  mixed
with primary sludge.Wastewater Engineering 797

SOURCES : WPCF (1988a), WEF and ASCE (1991b), US EPA (1991)Sludge from chemical (metal salts) precipitation is generally dark in
color or red (with iron) and slimy. Lime sludge is grayish br own.
Chemical sludge may create odor. Decomposition of chemical sludg e
occurs at a slower rate.
The nature of sludge from the tertiary (advanced) treatment process
depends on the unit process. Chemical sludge from phosphorus rem oval
is difficult to handle and treat. Tertiary sludge combined w ith biologi-
cal nitrification and denitrification is similar to waste activated sludge.
Example: Estimate the solids generated in the primary and secondary c lar-
ifiers at a secondary (activated sludge) treatment plant. Ass ume that the pri-
mary settling tank removes 65% of the TSS and 33% of the BOD5. Also
determine the volume of each sludge, assuming 6% and 1.2% of solid s in the
primary and secondary effluents, respectively.

A variety of treatment processes and overall sludge management opt ions
can be established, depending on the type and quantity of slu dge gener-
ated. Figure 6.54 illustrates schematically the wastewater sludge treat-
ment alternatives. The basic processes for sludge treatment incl ude
thickening, stabilization, conditioning, dewatering, and v olume reduction.
More details of sludge treatments are available from manufacturer s’

Figure 6.54 Sludge processing alternatives.Sludge thickening. As stated previously, all types of sludge contain a large
volume of water (Table 6.24). The purposes of sludge thickening are to
reduce the sludge volume to be handled in the subsequent sludge pro-
cessing units (pump, digester, dewatering equipment) and to r educe the
construction and operating costs of subsequent processes. Sludg e thick-
ening is a procedure used to remove water and increase the solids  content.
For example, if waste activated sludge with 0.6% solids is th ickened to a
content of 3.0% solids, a five-fold decrease in sludge volume is ach ieved.
Thickening a sludge with 3% to 8% solids may reduce its volum e by
50%. Sludge thickening mainly involves physical processes s uch as grav-
ity settling, flotation, centrifugation, and gravity belts.
Example: Estimate the sludge volume reduction when the sludge is thick -
ened from 4% to 7% solids concentration. The daily sludge producti on is
100 m3(26,420 gal).

Gravity thickening. Gravity thickening (Fig. 6.55) uses gravity forces to
separate solids from the sludge. The equipment is similar in d esign to a
conventional sedimentation basin. Sludge withdrawn from prim ary clar-
ifiers or sludge blending tanks is applied to the gravity t hickener through
a central inlet wall. The normal solids loading rates range from 30 to
60 kg solids per m2of tank bottom per day (6 to 12 lb/(ft2.d)) (Hammer,
1986). Coagulant is sometimes added for improving the settling . 542.9%Percent volume reduction 5s100257.1dm33100%
100 m3802 Chapter 6Typical hydraulic loading rates are from 16 to 32 m3/(m2.d) (390
to 785 gal/(d .ft2)). For waste activated sludge or for a very thin mix-
ture, hydraulic loading rates range from 4 to 8 m3/(m2.d) (100 to 200
gal/ (d .ft2)) for secondary sludges, and 16 to 32 m3/(m2.d) (390 to 785
gal/(d .ft2)) for primary sludges (US EPA, 1979). For activated sludge,
residence time in the thickener needs to be more than 18 h to redu ce
gas production and other undesirable effects (WEF and ASCE, 1991 b).
A typical design is a circular tank with a side depth of 3 to 4 m and a
floor sloping at 1:4 to 1:6.
Example 1: A residual with 4% solids is thickened to a 9% solids content.
What is the concentration factor?
solution:
Note : Concentration factor should be 2 or more for primary sludges, a nd 3 or
more for secondary sludges.

Dissolved air ﬂotation thickening. Flotation thickeners include dissolved
air flotation (DAF), vacuum flotation, and depressed-air flotation.  Only
DAF is used for wastewater sludge thickening in the US. It offer s sig-
nificant advantages in thickening light sludges such as  activated sludge.
The DAF thickener (Fig. 6.56) separates solids from the liquid ph ase inWastewater Engineering 805
Figure 6.56 Dissolved air flotation thickener ( source: US EPA, 1991 ).an upward direction by attaching fine air bubbles (60 to 1 00 mm) to
particles of suspended solids which then float. The influent str eam at
the tank bottom is saturated with air, pressurized (280 to 5 50 kPa),
then released to the inlet distributor. The retention tank is ma intained
at a pressure of 3.2 to 4.9 kg/cm2(45 to 70 lb/in2) (US EPA, 1987b).
The ratio of the quantity of air supplied and dissolved into th e recy-
cle or waste stream to that of solids (the air-to-solids, A/S rat io) is prob-
ably the most important factor affecting the performance of the flota tion
thickener. Normal loading rates for waste activated sludge ra nge from
10 to 20 kg solids/(m2.d) (2 to 4 lb/(ft2.d)). DAF thickening produces
about 4% solids with a solids recovery of 85% (Hammer, 1986). The
sludge volume index, SVI, is also an important factor for DAF operation.
Example 1: Determine hydraulic and solids loading rates for a DAF thick -
ener. The thickener, of 9 m (30 ft) diameter, treats 303 L/min (80 gal/min) of
waste activated sludge with a TSS concentration of 7800 mg/L.

Centrifuge thickening. A centrifuge acts both to thicken and to dewater
sludge. The centrifuge process separates liquid and solids by the influence
of centrifugal force which is typically 50 to 300 times that  of gravity (WEF
and ASCE, 1996b). Centrifuges may be used for thickening was te acti-
vated sludge or as dewatering devices for digested or conditioned sludges.
Three basic types (solid bowl, imperforate basket, and disc-nozzle) a re
commonly installed to thicken or dewater wastewater sludge.
The solid bowl scroll centrifuge (Fig. 6.57) is the most widely u sed type.
It rotates along a horizontal axis and operates in a continuou s-feed
manner. It consists of a rotating bowl having a cylindric al-conical shape 598.1% 5s86002166d mg/L3100%

through a stationary feed pipe continuously and the solids con centrate
on the periphery. The gravitational force causes the solids to set tle out
on the inner surface of the rotating bowl. A helical scroll, spi nning at a
slightly different speed, moves the settled solids toward the tap ered
end (outlet ports) and then discharges them. The light liquid pools above
the sludge layer flows toward the concentrate outlet ports. The un it
has a low cost/capacity ratio.
The basket centrifuge, also called the imperforate bowl (Fig. 6.58),
is a knife-discharge type and operates on a batch basis. Liqu id sludge
is transported by a pipe through the top and is fed to the bot tom of a
vertically mounted spinning bowl. Solids accumulate again st the wall
of the bowl by centrifugal force and the concentrate is decanted. The
duration of the feed time is controlled by a preset timer or a conc entrate
monitor (usually 60% to 85% of maximum depth). When the feed is
stopped, the bowl begins to decelerate. As a certain point a nozzl e skim-
mer (plow or knife) enters the bowl to remove the retained solids. The
solids fall through the bottom of the bowl into a hopper. The plow
retracts and the bowl accelerates, starting a new cycle. The units needs
a skilled operator.
The disc-nozzle centrifuge (Fig. 6.59) rotates along a vertical axis  and
operates in a continuous manner. The liquid sludge is fed norma lly
through the top of the unit (bottom feed is also possible) and flows
through a feedwell in the center of the rotor and to a set of some 50 con-
ical discs. An impeller within the rotor accelerates and di stributes the
feed slurry, filling the rotor interior. The centrifugal force is a pplied to808 Chapter 6
Figure 6.57 Solid bowl scroll centrifuge ( source: US EPA, 1991 ).the relatively thin film of liquid and solid between the discs . The force
throws the denser solid materials to the wall of the rotor bowl, where it
is subjected to additional centrifugal force and concentrated b efore it is
discharged through nozzles located on the periphery. The clarified liquid
passes on through the disc stack into the weir at the top of t he bowl, and
is then discharged.
The performance of a centrifuge is usually determined by the per-
centage of capture. It can be calculated as follows:

Gravity belt thickening. The gravity belt thickener is a relatively new
sludge thickening technique, stemming from the application of belt
presses for sludge dewatering. It is effective for raw sludge and
digested sludge with less than 2% solids content. A gravity belt moves
over rollers driven by a variable-speed drive unit. The sludge i s con-
ditioned with polymer and applied into a feed/distribution box  at one
end. The sludge is distributed evenly across the width of the m oving
belt as the liquid drains through, and the solids are car ried toward
the discharge end of the thickener and removed. The belt travels
through a wash cycle. Additional material on gravity belt  thickeners
and rotary drum thickeners may be found in WEF and ASCE (199 1b,
1996b).

Sludge stabilization. After sludge has thickened, it requires stabiliza-
tion to convert the organic solids to a more refractory or inert for m.
Thus the sludge can be handled or used as a soil conditioner w ithout
causing a nuisance or health hazard. The purposes of sludge st abiliza-
tion are to reduce pathogens, eliminate odor-causing materials, and to
inhibit, reduce, and eliminate the potential for putrefaction.
Treatment processes commonly used for stabilization of wastewater
sludges include anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion, chemic al (lime,
disinfectants) stabilization, and composting.
Anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic sludge digestion is the biochemical degra-
dation (oxidation) of complex organic substances in the absence of free
oxygen. The process is one of the oldest and most widely used methods . 525.4 lb polymer/ton dry sluge solid 58 gal/min38.34 lb/gal30.12%32000 lb/ton

organic matter is converted to methane, carbon dioxide, and wa ter. Thus
little carbon and energy are available to sustain further bi ological activ-
ity, and the remaining residuals are rendered stable.
Anaerobic digestion involves three basic successive phases of fer-
mentation: hydrolysis, acid formation, and methane formation (WE F
and ASCE, 1996b; US EPA, 1991). In the first phase of dig estion, extra-
cellular enzymes (enzymes operating outside the cells) break down com -
plex organic substances (proteins, cellulose, lignins, lipid s) into soluble
organic fatty acids, alcohols, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.
In the second phase, acid-forming bacteria, including facult ative bac-
teria, convert the products of the first stage into short-chain organic
acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, other low molecu lar weight
organic acids, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. These volatile org anic acids
tend to reduce the pH, although alkalinity buffering materials  are also
produced. Organic matter is converted into a form suitable for break-
down by the second group of bacteria.
The third phase, strictly anaerobic, involves two groups of met hane-
forming bacteria (methanogens). One group converts carbon and hy dro-
gen to methane. The other group converts acetate to methane, carbon
dioxide, and other trace gases. Both groups of bacteria are ana erobic.
Closed digesters are used for anaerobic digestion. It should be n oted that
many authors consider only two phases (excluding phase 1 abov e).
The most important factors affecting the performance of anaerobic
digesters are solids residence time, hydraulic residence time, tempera-
ture, pH, and toxic materials. Methanogens are very sensitive to envi-
ronmental conditions. Anaerobic digesters are usually heated t o
maintain a temperature of 34 to 36 /H11034C (94 to 97 /H11034F). The methane bacte-
ria are active in the mesophilic range (27 to 43 /H11034C, 80 to 110 /H11034F). They have
a slower growth rate than the acid formers and are very specifi c in food
supply requirements. The anaerobic digester (two-stage) usually p ro-
vides 10 to 20 days’ detention of sludge (WEF and ASCE, 1996b).
Optimum methane production typically occurs when the pH is main-
tained between 6.8 and 6.2. If the temperature falls below the op erat-
ing range and/or the digestion times falls below 15 days, th e digester
may become upset and require close monitoring and attention.
If concentrations of certain materials such as ammonia, sulfi de, light
metal cations, and heavy metals increase significantly in anaerobic
digesters, they can inhibit or upset the process of performance.
The key parameter for digester sizing is solids residence time. For
digester systems without recycle, there is no difference between SRT and
HRT. Volatile solids loading rate is also used frequently as a  basis for
design. Typically, design SRT values are from 30 to 60 days  for low-rate
digesters and 10 to 20 days for high-rate digesters (WEF and AS CE, 1991b).Wastewater Engineering 813Volatile solids loading criteria are generally based on susta ined load-
ing conditions (typically peak month or peak week solids produ ction),
with provisions for avoiding excessive loading during shorter time peri-
ods. A typical design sustained peak volatile solids loading  rate is 1.9 to
2.5 kg VS/(m3/H11080 d) (0.12 to 0.16 lb VS/(ft3/H11080 d)). A maximum limit of 3.2 kg
VS/(m3/H11080 d) (0.20 lb VS/(ft3/H11080 d)) is often used (WEF and ASCE, 1991b).
The configuration of an anaerobic digester is typically a sing le-stage
or two-stage process (Fig. 6.60). For the low rate, single-stage dig ester,
three separate layers (scum, supernatant, and sludge layers) form as
decomposition occurs. The stabilized (digested) sludge settles at t he
bottom of the digester. The supernatant is usually returned to t he plant
influent. In a single-stage high rate process, the digester is  heated and814 Chapter 6
Figure 6.60 Configuration of (a) single-stage and (b) two-stage anaerobic digesters
(source: US EPA, 1991 ).mixed, and supernatant is not withdrawn. In a two-stage s ystem, sludge
is stabilized in the first stage, whereas the second stage prov ides set-
tling and thickening. The digester is heated to 34 to 36 /H11034C.
An anaerobic digester is designed to provide warm, oxygen-free, an d
well-mixed conditions to digest organic matter and to reduce pa tho-
genic organisms. The hardware include covers, heaters, and mi xers.
Operation of the process demands control of food supply, temperature
(31 to 36 /H11034C, 88 to 97 /H11034F), pH (6.8 to 7.2), alkalinity (2000 to 3500 mg/L
as CaCO3), and detention time (60 days at 20 /H11034C to 15 days at 35 /H11034C).
Gas production. Gas production is one of the important parameters
for measuring the performance of the digester. Typically, gas pr oduction
ranges from 810 to 1120 L of digester gas per kg volatile solids  (13 to
18 ft3gas/lb VS) destroyed. Gas produced from a properly operated
digester contains approximately 65% to 69% methane and 31% to 3 5%
carbon dioxide. If more than 35% of gas is carbon dioxide, there is prob-
ably something wrong with the digestion system (US EPA, 199 1). The
quantity of methane gas produced can be computed by the followin g
equation (McCarty, 1964)

relatively shallow cylindrical vessel with moderate floor and roof slopes.
The typical conventional German digester is a deep cylindrica l tank
with steeply sloped top and bottom cones. The egg-shaped digester w as
first installed in Germany in the 1950s.
The advantages of the egg-shaped digester over conventional digesters
include the elimination of abrupt change in the vessel geometry,  reduced
inactive volume of the digester, more cost effectiveness and less energ y
costs. The egg shape of the vessel provides unique advantages. It s mech-
anisms are as follows. Heavy solids cannot settle out over a lar ge unman-
ageable bottom area; they must concentrate in the steep-sided bott om
cone. Light solids do not accumulate across a large diameter s urface
area; they concentrate at the top of a steep-sided converging cone. The
settleable materials can be pumped to the top of the vessel to sin k light
material into the digesting main mass. Likewise, light mat erials can be
pumped to the bottom zone to stir the heavier materials. Small a mounts
of energy are required to manage the top and bottom zones. Moving
materials through the main digesting mass to assure homogeneou s
digester conditions can be done more effectively (CBI Walker, 1998).
The egg-shaped digester is currently constructed of steel. It has
become popular in the United States and other countries. More det ailed
description and design information may be found elsewhere (CBI
Walker, 1998; Stukenberg et al., 1990).
Aerobic digestion. Aerobic digestion is used to stabilize primary sludge,
secondary sludge, or a combination of these by long-term aeration.  The
process converts organic sludge solids to carbon dioxide, ammon ia, and
water by aerobic bacteria with reduction of volatile solids, p athogens,
and offensive odor.
In a conventional aerobic digester, concentration of influent VSS  must
be no more than 3 % for retention times of 15 to 20 days. High-puri ty
oxygen may be used for oxygen supply.
Sludge is introduced to the aerobic digester on a batch (mostly ), semi-
batch, or continuous basis. Aerobic digesters are typically  a single-stage
open tank like the activated-sludge aeration tank. In the bat ch basis,
the digester is filled with raw sludge and aerated for 2 to 3 weeks, then
stopped. The supernatant is decanted and the settled solids ar e removed
(US EPA, 1991). For the semibatch basis, raw sludge is add ed every
couple of days; the supernatant is decanted periodically, and  the settled
solids are held in the digester for a long time before being removed.820 Chapter 6The design standard for aerobic digesters varies with sludge c haracter-
istics and method of ultimate sludge disposal. Sizing of the d igester is com-
monly based on volatile solids loading of the digester or the vola tile solids
loading rate. It is generally determined by pilot and/or full -scale study. In
general, volatile suspended solids loading rates for aerobic dig esters vary
from 1.1 to 3.2 kg VSS/(m3/H11080d) (0.07 to 0.20 lb VSS/(ft3/H11080 d)), depending on
the temperature and type of sludge. Solids retention time is 15 to 20 days
for activated sludge only, and that for primary plus activ ated sludge is 20
to 25 days (US EPA, 1991). An aeration period ranges from 200  to 300
degree-days which is computed by multiplying the digester’s temperature
in /H11034C by the sludge age. According to Rule 503 (Federal Register, 1 993), if
the sludge is for land application, the residence time requirem ents range
from 60 days at 15 /H11034C (900 /H11034/H11080d) to 40 days at 20 /H11034C (800 /H11034/H11080d). Desirable aer-
obic digestion temperatures are approximately 18 to 27 /H11034C (65 to 80 /H11034F). A
properly operated aerobic digester is capable of achieving a vola tile solids
reduction of 40% to 50% and a pathogens reduction of 90%.
GLUMRB (1996) recommended volume requirements based on pop-
ulation equivalent (PE). Table 6.25 presents the recommended diges tion
tank capacity based on a solids content of 2% with supernata nt sepa-
ration performed in a separate tank. If supernatant separation  is per-
formed in the digestion tank, a minimum of 25% additional volu me is
required. If high solids content (>2%) is applied, the digestion tank
volume may be reduced proportionally. A digestion temperature of 15 /H11034C
(59/H11034F) and a solids retention time of 27 days (405 /H11034/H11080 d) is recommended.
Cover and heating are required for cold temperature climate areas .
The air requirements of aerobic digestion are based on DO (1 to 2 m g/L)
and mixing to keep solids in suspension. If DO in the digest ion tank
falls below 1.0 mg/L, the aerobic digestion process will be neg ativelyWastewater Engineering 821

Lime stabilization. Chemical stabilization of wastewater sludge is an
alternative to biological stabilization. It involves chemical  oxidation
(commonly using chlorine) and pH adjustment under basic condi tions,
which is achieved by addition of lime or lime-containing matt er. Chemical
oxidation is achieved by dosing the sludge with chlorine (or ozon e, hydro-
gen peroxide). The sludge is deodorized and microbiological activit ies
slowed down. The sludge can then be dewatered and disposed of.
In the lime stabilization process, lime is added to sludge in  sufficient
quantity to raise the pH to 12 or higher for a minimum of 2 h contact.
The highly alkaline environment will inactivate biological g rowth and
destroy pathogens. The sludge does not putrefy, create odors, or pose a
health hazard. However, if the pH drops below 11, renewed bacteria and
pathogen growth can reoccur. Since the addition of lime does not reduce
the volatile organics, the sludge must be further treated and disposed
of before the organic matter starts to putrefy again.
With 40 CFR Part 503 regulations (Federal Register, 1993) to red uce
pathogens, a supplemental heat system can be used to reduce th e quan-
tity of lime required to obtain the proper temperature. Additiona l heat-
ing reduces the lime dosage and operating costs.
Composting. Composting is an aerobic biological decomposition of
organic material to a stable end product at an elevated temper ature.
Some facilities have utilized anaerobic composting in a sanita ry, nuisance-
free environment to create a stable humus-like material suitable for plant
growth. Approximately 20% to 30% of volatile solids are converted to
carbon dioxide and water at temperatures in the pasteurization  range of
50 to 70 /H11034C (122 to 158 /H11034F). At these temperatures most enteric pathogens
are destroyed. Thermophilic bacteria are responsible for decomposing
organic matter. The finished compost has a moisture content of 40 % to
50% and a volatile solids content of 40% or less (US EPA, 1991).
The optimum moisture content for composting is 50% to 60% water.
Dewatered wastewater sludges are generally too wet to meet optimum
composing conditions. If the moisture content is over 60% water, proper
structural integrity must be obtained. The dewatered sludge a nd bulk-
ing agent must be uniformly mixed. Sufficient air must be su pplied to the
composting pile, either by forced aeration or windrow turning t o main-
tain oxygen levels between 5% and 15%. Odor control may be requir ed
on some sites.
In order to comply with the “process to significantly reduce p athogens”
(PSRP) requirements of 40 CFR Part 257 (Federal Register, 1993), the
compost pile must be maintained at a minimum operating temp erature826 Chapter 6of 40 /H11034C (104 /H11034F) for at least 5 days. During this time, the temperature mus t
be allowed to increase above 55 /H11034C (131 /H11034F) for at least 4 h to ensure
pathogen destruction. In order to comply with the “process to fu rther
reduce pathogens” (PFRP) requirements of 40 CFR Part 257 (Federal
Register, 1993), the in-vessel and static aerated compost piles  must be
maintained at a minimum operating temperature of 55 /H11034C for at least
3 days. The windrow pile must be maintained at a minimum operating
temperature of 55 /H11034C for 15 days. In addition, there must be at least three
turnings of the compost pile during this period.
Sludge conditioning. Mechanically concentrated (thickened) sludges
and biologically and chemically stabilized sludges still require some
conditioning steps. Sludge conditioning can involve chemical  and/or
physical treatment to enhance water removal. Sludge conditioni ng is
undertaken before sludge dewatering.
Details of process chemistry, design considerations, mechanica l com-
ponents, system layout, operation, and costs of conditional meth ods are
presented in Sludge Conditioning Manual (WAPCF, 1988a). Some addi-
tional sludge conditioning processes disinfect sludge, control odors, alter
the nature of solids, provide limited solids destruction, and increase
solids recovery.
Chemical conditioning. Chemical conditioning can reduce the 90% to 99%
incoming sludge moisture content to 65% to 80%, depending on the nature
of the sludge to be treated (WPCF, 1988a). Chemical conditioning r esults
in coagulation of the solids and release of the absorbed water. Ch emicals
used for sludge conditioning include inorganic compounds such  as lime,
pebble quicklime, ferric chloride, alum, and organic polymers  (polyelec-
trolytes). Addition of conditioning chemicals may increase the dry solids
of the sludge. Inorganic chemicals can increase the dry solid s by 20% to
30%, but polymers do not increase the dry solids significantl y.
Physical conditioning. The physical process includes using hot and cold
temperatures to change sludge characteristics. The commonly us ed phys-
ical conditioning methods are thermal conditioning and elutr iation. Less
commonly used methods include freeze–thaw, solvent extraction, irr a-
diation, and ultrasonic vibration.
The thermal conditioning (heat treatment) process involves heating
the sludge to a temperature of 177 to 240 /H11034C (350 to 464 /H11034F) in a reaction
vessel under pressure of 1720 to 2760 kN/m2(250 to 400 lb/in2[psig])
for a period of 15 to 40 min (US EPA, 1991). One modification of t he
process involves the addition of a small amount of air. Heat coag ulates
solids, breaks down the structure of microbial cells in wast e activated
sludge, and releases the water bound in the cell. The heat-treated  sludge
is sterilized and practically deodorized. It has excellent dewa teringWastewater Engineering 827characteristics and does not normally require chemical condi tioning to
dewater well on mechanical equipment, Yielding cake solids con cen-
trations of 40% to 50%.
Heat treatment is suitable for many types of sludge that cannot  be sta-
bilized biologically due to the presence of toxic materials and i s relatively
insensitive to change in sludge composition. However, the process pro-
duces liquid sidestreams with high concentrations of organic s, ammonia
nitrogen, and color. Significant odorous off-gases are also generated
which must be collected and treated before release. The process has
high capital cost because of its mechanical complexity and the use of
corrosion-resistant material. It also requires close supervision , skilled
operators, and O and M programs. More detailed description of t hermal
processing of sludge can be found elsewhere (WPCF, 1988a; WEF and
ASCE, 1991b).
A physical conditioning method used in the past is elutriat ion. In elu-
triation, a washing process, sludge is mixed with a liqu id for the pur-
pose of transferring certain soluble organic or inorganic componen ts to
the liquid. Wastewater effluent is usually used for elutriation . The
volume of wastewater is two to six times the volume of sludge. The el u-
triation of the sludge produces large volumes of liquid that con tain a high
concentration of suspended solids. This liquid, when returned t o the
treatment plant, increases the solids and organic loadings.  Elutriation
tanks are designed to act as gravity thickeners with solid s loading rates
of 39 to 49 kg/(m2/H11080 d) (8 to 10 lb/(ft2/H11080 d)) (Qasim, 1985).
Sludge dewatering. Following stabilization and/or conditioning, waste-
water sludge can be ultimately disposed of, or can be dewatered prior to
further treatment and/or ultimate disposal. It is generally more eco-
nomical to dewater before disposal. The primary objective of dewateri ng
is to reduce sludge moisture. Subsequently, it reduces the cost s of pump-
ing and hauling to the disposal site. Dewatered sludge is ea sier to handle
than thickened or liquid sludge. Dewatering is also required  before com-
posting, prior to sludge incineration, and prior to landfill . An advantage
of dewatering is that it makes the sludge odorless and nonputr escible.
Sludge can be dewatered by slow natural evaporation and percol ation
(drying beds, drying lagoons) or by mechanical devices, mecha nically
assisted physical means, such as vacuum filtration, pres sure filtration,
centrifugation, or recessed plate filtration.
Vacuum ﬁltration. Vacuum filtration has been used for wastewater
sludge dewatering for almost seven decades. Its use has declined  owing
to competition from the belt press. A rotary vacuum filter consis ts of a
cylindrical drum covered with cloth of natural or synthetic  fabric, coil
springs, or woven stainless steel mesh. The drum is partly s ubmerged
(20% to 40%) in a vat containing the sludge to be dewatered.828 Chapter 6The filter drum is divided into compartments. In sequence, each  com-
partment is subject to vacuums ranging from 38 to 75 cm (1 8 to 30 in)
of mercury. As it slowly rotates, vacuum is applied immedia tely under
the mat formation or sludge pick-up zone. Suction continues to dew a-
ter the solids adhering to the filter medium as it rotates out of the
liquid. This is called the drying zone of the cycle. The cake dr ying zone
represents from 40% to 60% of the drum surface. The vacuum is then
stopped, and the solids cake is removed to a sludge hopper or a conveyor.
The filter medium is washed by water sprays before reentering the vat.
For small plants, 35 h operation per week is often designed. This  allows
daily 7 h operation with 1 h for start-up and wash-down. For larger
plants, vacuum filters are often operated for a period of 16 to 20 h/d
(Hammer, 1986).
Example: A 3 m (10 ft) diameter by 4.5 m (15 ft) long vacuum filter dewa-
ters 5400 kg/d primary plus secondary sludge solids. The fi lter is operated 7 h/d
with a drum cycle time of 4 min. The dewatered sludge has 25% solids con-
tent. The filter yield is 17.3 kg/(m2/H11080h). Determine the filter loading rate and
percent solids recovery. What is the daily operating hours requ ired if the
dewatered sludge is 30% solids with the same percentage of solids  recovery
and a filter yield of 9.8 kg/(m2 /H11080 h)?

Pressure ﬁltration. There are two types of pressure filtration process as
used for sludge dewatering. Normally, they are the belt filter p ress and
the plate and frame filter press. The operating mechanics of these two
filter press types are completely different. The belt filter press is  popu-
lar due to availability of smaller sizes and uses polymer for c hemical floc-
culation of the sludge. It consumes much less energy than the vacuum
filter. The plate and frame filter press is used primarily to d ewater
chemical sludges. It is a large machine and uses lime and  ferric chloride
for conditioning of organic sludge prior to dewatering. The filtered  cake
is very compact and dry.
Belt filter press. A belt filter press consists of two endless, tensioned,
porous belts. The belts travel continuously over a series of rollers  of
varied diameter that squeeze out the water from the sludge and pr oduce
a dried cake that can be easily removed from the belts. Variat ions in belt
filter press design are available from different manufacturers.
Chemical conditioning of sludge is vital to the efficiency of a b elt filter
press. Polymers are used as a conditioning agent, especially c ationic
polymers. The operation of the belt filter press comprises three zones,
i.e. gravity drainage, low-pressure and high-pressure zones. Con ditioned
sludge is first introduced uniformly to the gravity drainag e zone and onto
the moving belt where it is allowed to thicken. The majority of fr ee
water is removed from the sludge by gravity. Free water readily sepa-
rates from the slurry and is recycled back through the treat ment system.
The efficiency of gravity drainage depends on the type of sludge, th e
quality of the sludge, sludge conditioning, the belt screen mes h, and
design of the drainage section. Typically, gravity drainag e occurs on a
flat or slightly inclined belt for a period of 1 to 2 min. A 5% to 10%
increase in solids content is achieved in this zone; that is,  1% to 5%
sludge feed produces 6% to 15% solids prior to compression (US EPA,
1991).
Following the gravity drainage zone, pressure is applied in th e low-
pressure (wedge) zone. The pressure can come from the compression of
the sludge between two belts or from the application of a vacuum on the
lower belt. In the wedge zone, the thickened sludge is subjected t o low
pressure to further remove water from the sludge matrix. This is to 512.3 h/d 55400 kg/d30.95

to which it is subjected by rollers.
On some units, the low-pressure zone is followed by a high-pressure
zone, where the sludge is sandwiched between porous belts and sub -
jected to shearing forces as the belts pass through a series of r ollers of
decreasing diameter. The roller arrangement progressively increas es the
pressure. The squeezing and shearing forces induce the further relea se
of additional amounts of water from the sludge cake.
The final dewatered filter cake is removed from the belts by scraper
blades into a hopper or conveyor belt for transfer to the sludge ma n-
agement area. After the cake is removed, a spray of water is app lied to
wash and rinse the belts. The spray rinse water, together wit h the fil-
trate, is recycled back to primary or secondary treatment.
Belt filter presses are commercially available in metric sizes from 0.5
to 3.5 m in belt width, with the most common size between 1.0 and 2.5 m.
Hydraulic loading based on belt width varies from 25 to 100 gal/
(min /H11080 m) (1.6 to 6.3 L/(m /H11080 s)). Sludge loading rates range from 200 to
1500 lb/(m /H11080h) (90 to 680 kg/(m /H11080 h)) (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991).
Typical operating parameters for belt filter press dewatering of polymer-
conditioned wastewater sludges are presented in Table 6.26.
Odor is often a problem with the belt filter press. Adequate vent ilation
to remove hydrogen sulfide or other gases is also a safety considera tion.Wastewater Engineering 831

SOURCES : WPCF, 1983; Viessman and Hammer, 1993; WEF, 1996bHydrogen peroxide or potassium permanganate can be used to oxidize the
odor-causing chemical (H2S). Potassium permanganate can improve the
dewatering efficiency of the sludge and can reduce the quantity of poly-
mer required.

Plate and frame filter press. There are several types of filter press avail-
able. The most common type, the plate and frame filter press, cons ists
of vertical plates that are held rigidly in a frame and pres sed together
between fixed and moving ends (Fig. 6.61a). As shown in Fig. 6. 61b, each
chamber is formed by paired recessed plates. A series of individu al 595.4% 5  s865240d lb/sh#md3100%

channels. Fabric filter media are mounted on the face of each indi -
vidual plate, thus providing initial solids capture.
The filter press operates in batch manner to dewater sludge. Desp ite
its name, the filter press does not press or squeeze sludge. Instea d,
when the filter is closed, the recessed faces of adjacent plates form  a834 Chapter 6

up to 225 lb/in2(15 atm, 1550 kN/m2) and maintained for less than 2 h
(CPC Eng., 1980). The water passes through the filter cloth, wh ile the
solids are retained and form a cake on the cloth. During the i nitial
phase of operation the fabric cloth retains the solids which th en become
the filter media. This action results in high solids captur e and a filtrate
of maximum clarity. At the end of a filtration cycle, the feed p ump
system is stopped and the chamber plates are opened, allowing the cake
to fall into appropriate hoppers or conveyors. Filter cloth usual ly
requires a precoat (ash or diatomaceous earth) to aid retention of s olids
on the cloth and release of cake. Drainage ports are provided at both the
top and the bottom of each chamber (Figure 6.61b). This figure show s
a fixed volume, recessed plate filter press. Another type, the var iable
volume recessed plate filter press, is also used for sludge dewater ing.
The advantages of the plate filter press include production of hig her
solids cake, 35% to 50% versus 18% for both belt press (US EPA, 1991) and
vacuum filters, higher clarity filtrate, lower energy consump tion, lower o
& M costs, longer equipment service life, and relatively simpl e operation.
However, sufficient washing and air drying time between cycles is required.
Example: A plate and frame filter press has a plate surface of 400 ft2and
is used to dewater conditioned waste activated sludge with a solids concen-
tration of 2.5%. The filtration time is 110 min at 225 lb/in2(gage) and the time
to discharge the sludge and restart the feed is 10 min. The tot al volume of
sludge dewatered is 3450 gal. (1) Determine the solids loading rate and the

Centrifugation. The centrifugation process is also used for dewatering
raw, digested, and waste activated sludge. The process is di scussed in
more detail in the section on sludge thickening. Typically, a centrifuge
produces a cake with 15% to 30% dry solids. The solids captur e ranges
from 50% to 80% and 80% to 95%, without and with proper chemica l
sludge conditioning, respectively (US EPA, 1987b).
Sludge drying beds. Sludge drying beds remove moisture by natural
evaporation, gravity, and/or induced drainage, and are the most widely
used method of dewatering municipal sludge in the United Stat es. They
are usually used for dewatering well-digested sludge. Drying b eds
include conventional sand beds, paved beds, unpaved beds, wed ge-wire
beds, and vacuum-assisted beds.
Drying beds are less complex, easier to operate, require less opera t-
ing energy, and produce higher solids cake than mechanical dewatering
systems. However, more land is needed for them. Drying beds are us u-
ally used for small- and mid-size wastewater treatment plants with
design flow of less than 7500 m3/d (2 Mgal/d), due to land restrictions
(WEF, 1996b).
Sand drying beds. Sand drying beds generally consist of 10 to 23 cm
(4 to 9 in) of sand placed over a 20 to 50 cm (8 to 20 in) lay er of gravel.
The diameters of sand and gravel range from 0.3 to 1.22 mm and  from
0.3 to 2.5 cm, respectively. The water drains to an underdra in system
that consists of perforated pipe at least 10 cm (4 in) in diam eter and
spaced 2.4 to 6 m (8 to 20 ft) apart. Drying beds usually consist of a 0.3
to 1 m (1 to 3 ft) high retaining wall enclosing process drai nage media
(US EPA, 1989, 1991). The drying area is partitioned into i ndividual
beds, 6 m wide by 6 to 30 m long (20 ft wide by 20 to 100 ft  long), or of
a convenient size so that one or two beds will be filled in a norm al cycle
(Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991).
In a typical sand drying bed digested and/or conditioned s ludge is
discharged (at least 0.75 m/s velocity) on the bed in a 30 t o 45 cm (12 to
18 in) layer and allowed to dewater by drainage through the s ludge
mass and supporting sand and by evaporation from the surfac e exposed
to air. Dissolved gases are released and rise to the surface. The water
drains through the sand and is collected in the underdrain  system and
generally returned to the plant for further treatment.
Design area requirements for open sludge drying beds are based on
sludge loading rate, which is calculated on a per capita basis or on a
unit load of mass of dry solids per unit area per year. On a per capita836 Chapter 6basis, surface areas range from 1.0 to 2.5 ft2/person (0.09 to 0.23 m2/
person), depending on sludge type. Sludge loading rates are betw een
12 and 23 lb dry solids/(ft2/H11080yr) (59 and 113 kg/(m2/H11080yr) (Metcalf and
Eddy, Inc. 1991).
The design, use, and performance of the drying bed are affected by t he
type of sludge, sludge conditioning, sludge application rates  and depth,
dewatered sludge removal techniques, and climatic conditions.
Example: A sand drying bed, 6 m by 30 m (20 by 100 ft), receives cond itioned
sludge to a depth of 30 cm (12 in). The sludge feed contains 3% sol ids. The sand
bed requires 29 days to dry and one day to remove the sludge from  the bed for
another application. Determine the amount of sludge applied per application
and the annual solids loading rate. The sp. gr. of sludge feed is 1.02.

Paved beds. Paved beds consist of a concrete or asphalt pavement
above a porous gravel subbase with a slope of at least 1.5%. Ther e are
two types of drainage, i.e. a drainage type and a decant typ e. Unpaved
areas, constructed as sand drains, are placed around the p erimeter or 522.8 lb/sft2#yrd 5111 kg/sm2#yrd sOK within 59 2113 kg/sm2#yrd 51650 kg/app 3365 d/yr

advantage of the paved bed is that sludge can be removed by a front-
end loader. The bed areas are larger and typically rectangula r in shape,
being 6 to 15 m (20 to 50 ft) wide by 21 to 46 m (70 to 150 ft ) long with
vertical side walls as sand beds. Cake solids contents as much as 50%
can be achieved in an arid climate.
Well designed paved beds may remove about 20% to 30% of the water
with good settling solids. Solids concentration may range from  40% to
50% for a 30 to 40 days drying time in an arid climate for a 30 cm (1 ft)
sludge layer (Metcalf and Eddy, Inc. 1991).
Unpaved beds. Unpaved beds may be used in warm and dry climate
areas where groundwater is not a concern. The beds are similar to paved
beds with decanting. Sufficient storage area is required duri ng a wet
weather period, because access to the beds is restricted during  wet
weather.
Vacuum-assisted drying beds. The vacuum-assisted drying bed consists
of a reinforced concrete ground slab, a layer of supporting aggreg ate,
and a rigid porous media plate on top. The space between the con-
crete slab and the multimedia plate is the vacuum chamber,  con-
nected to a vacuum pump. This is to accelerate sludge dewateri ng and
drying.
Polymer-preconditioned sludge is applied to the surface of the media
plates until it is entirely covered. The vacuum is then appl ied to remove
the free water from the sludge. The sludge is air dried for 24 to 4 8 h.
Essentially all of the solids remain on top of the media plates form a cake
of fairly uniform thickness. The cake has solids concentration fr om 9%
to 35%, depending on sludge feed (WEF, 1996b).
The dewatered sludge is removed by a front-end loader. The porous
multimedia plates are washed with a high-pressure hose to remov e the
remaining sludge residue before another application.
The vacuum-assisted drying bed has a short cycle time and n eeds
less footage. However, it is labor intensive and is expensive to oper ate.
Drying beds are sometimes enclosed in a greenhouse-type glass str uc-
ture to increase drying efficiency in wet or colder climates. The enclo-
sure also serves for odor and insect control, and improves the over all
appearance of the treatment plant. Good ventilation is required to allow
moisture to escape.
Wedge-wire drying beds. The wedge-wire (wedgewater) drying bed was
developed in England and there exist a few installations in t he United
States. The material for the drying bed consists of stainless s teel wedge
wire or high-density polyurethane. It is a physical process similar to the
vacuum-assisted drying bed.
The bed consists of a shallow rectangular watertight basin fi tted with
a false floor of artificial media, wedge-wire panels (Fig. 6.62). The panels838 Chapter 6(wedge-wire septum) have wedge-shaped slotted openings of 0.25 mm
(0.01 in). The false floor is made watertight with caulking wh ere the
panels abut the walls. An outlet valve to control the draina ge rate is
located underneath the false floor. Water or plant effluent is intr oduced
to the bed from beneath the wedge-wire septum up to a depth of 2.5 c m
(1 in) over the septum. This water serves as a cushion and prev ents com-
pression or other disturbance of the colloidal particles. The slu dge is
introduced slowly onto a horizontal water level to float without c ausing
upward or downward pressure across the wedgewire surface. After the
bed is filled with sludge, the initially separate water lay er and drainage
water are allowed to percolate away at a controlled flow rate thr ough
the outlet valve. After the free water has been drained, the sludg e fur-
ther concentrates by drainage and evaporation until there is a require-
ment for sludge removal (US EPA, 1987b).
The advantages of this process include no clogging in the wedgew ire,
treatability of aerobically digested sludge, constant and ra pid drainage,
higher throughput than the sand bed, and ease of operation and  main-
tenance. However, the capital cost is higher than that of other drying beds.
Sludge drying lagoons. A sludge drying lagoon is similar to a sand bed
in that the digested sludge is introduced to a lagoon and rem oved after
a period of drying. Unlike the sand drying bed, the lagoon does  not have
an underdrain system to drain water. Sludge drying lagoons  are not
suitable for dewatering untreated sludges, lime treated sludges , or
sludge with a high strength of supernatant, due to odor and nuisance
potential.
Sludge drying lagoons are operated by periodically decanting the
supernatant back to the plant and by evaporation. They are p eriodically
dredged to remove sludge. Unconditioned digested sludge is introd ucedWastewater Engineering 839
Figure 6.62 Crosssection of a wedgewire drying bed ( source: US EPA, 1991 ).to the lagoon to a depth of 0.75 to 1.25 m (2.5 to 4 ft). It wil l dry mainly
by evaporation in 3 to 5 months, depending on climate. Dried sludge is
removed mechanically at a solids content of 20% to 30% percent. I f
sludge is to be used for soil conditioning, it needs to be stored for fur-
ther drying. A 3-year cycle may be applied: lagooning for 1 yea r, drying
for 18 months, and cleaning and resting for 6 months.
Solids loading rates are 36 to 39 kg/(m3/H11080 y) (2.2 to 2.4 lb/(ft3/H11080 y)) of
lagoon capacity (US EPA, 1987b). The lagoons are operated in pa rallel;
at least two units are essential. Very little process control is needed.
Sludge lagoons are the most basic treatment units.
Other sludge volume reduction processes. Processes such as heat treatment
and thermal combustion can reduce the moisture content and vol ume
of the sludge. Detailed discussions are presented in the section on solids
treatment.
Example: A POTW generates 1800 kg/d (3970 lb/d) of dewatered sludge at
33% solids concentration. The moisture content of composted material  and
compost mixture are 35% and 55%, respectively. What is the mas s of com-
posted material that must be blended daily with the dewatered  sludge?

29.3 Sewage sludge biosolids
Sewage sludge processing (i.e. thickening, stabilization, cond itioning,
and dewatering) produces a volume reduction, and this reducti on in
volume decreases the capital and operating costs. Digestion or com-
posting of the sludge reduces the level of pathogens and odors. The840 Chapter 6degree of the sludge treatment process is very important to elimin ate
pathogens when considering land application of the sludge, wh en dis-
tributing and marketing it, and when placing it in mon ofills or on a sur-
face disposal site.
The end product of wastewater sludge treatment processes is referred
to as “biosolids.” Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (1997) defines  biosolids
as solid organic matter recovered from a sewage treatment process and
used especially as fertilizer for plants. The McGraw-Hill Dictionary of
Scientific and Technical Terms (5th ed., 1994) defines biosolid as a recy-
clable, primarily organic solid material produced by wast ewater treat-
ment processes.
The term “biosolids” has gained recently in popularity as a synonym
for sewage sludge because it perhaps has more reuse potential tha n the
term “treated wastewater sludge.” The name was chosen by the Wa ter
Environmental Federation (WEF) in early 1990s.
29.4 Use and disposal of sewage 
sludge biosolids
Biosolids are commonly used and disposed of in many ways. The b ene-
ficial uses of biosolids include land application to agricul tural lands, land
application to nonagricultural lands, and the sale or giv e-away of
biosolids for use on home gardens. Nonagricultural areas may i nclude
compost, forests, public contact (parks, highways, recreation al areas, golf
courses, etc.). Case histories of beneficial use programs for biosoli ds use
and management can be found elsewhere (WEF, 1994).
Disposal methods of biosolids include disposal in municipal landfills,
disposal on delicate sites, surface disposal, and incinerati on. Surface dis-
posal includes piles of biosolids left on the land surface and l and appli-
cation to dedicated nonagricultural land, and disposal in  sludge-only
landfills (monofills).
29.5 Regulatory requirements
In 1993, the US EPA promulgated “the standard for the use an d disposal
of sewage sludge, final rule, title 40 of the Code of Federation
Regulations (CFR), Parts 257, 403, and 503” (Federal Register, 1993).
All the above three plus “Phase-in submission of sewage sludge per mit
application: final rule, revisions to 40 CFR Parts 122, 123 , and 501” are
reprinted by the Water Environmental Federation, stock #P0100
(1993b). “The Part 503 rule” or “Part 503” was developed to protec t
public health and the environment from any reasonably antici pated
adverse effects of using or disposing of sewage sludge biosolids. Tw o
easy-to-read versions of the Part 503 rule were published by US EP A
(1994, 1995).Wastewater Engineering 841The CFR 40 Part 503 includes five subparts. They are general pr ovi-
sions, requirement for land application, surface disposal, pa thogen and
vector attraction (flies, mosquitoes, and other potential disease-c arrying
organisms) reduction, and incineration. For each of the regulated  use
or disposal methods, the rule covers general requirements, pollut ant
limits, operational standards (pathogen and vector attracti on reduction
for land application and surface disposal; total hydrocarbon s or carbon
dioxide for incineration), management practices, and requirement  for the
frequency of monitoring, record keeping, and reporting. The require-
ments of the Part 503 are self-implementing and must be followed even
without the insurance of a permit. State regulatory agencies m ay have
their own rules governing the use or disposal of sewage sludge bi osolids
or domestic septage.
Part 503 applies to any person who applies biosolids to the la nd, or
burns the biosolids in an incinerator, and to the operator/own er of a sur-
face disposal site, or to any person preparing to use, dispose of,  or incin-
erate biosolids. A person is defined as an individual, associa tion,
partnership, corporation, municipality, state, or federal ag ency, or an
agent or employee thereof.
A person must apply for a permit covering biosolids use or disp osal
standards if they own or operate a treatment works treating dom estic
sewage (TWTDS). In most cases, Part 503 requirements will be incor -
porated over a time period into National Pollutant Discharge El imination
System (NPDES) permits issued to Public Owned Treatment Works
(POTWs) and TWTDSs. Application for a federal biosolids permit must
be submitted to the appropriate US EPA Regional Office, not the s tate.
Until the biosolids management programs of individual states  are
approved by the US EPA, the US EPA will remain the permitti ng
authority.
Most sewage sludge biosolids currently generated by POTWs in the
United States meet the minimum pollutant limits and pathog en and
vector attraction reduction requirements set forth in the Part 5 03. Some
biosolids already meet the most stringent Part 503 pollutant limit stan-
dards and requirements of pathogen and vector attraction reduc tion.
Pathogen reduction requirements. The Part 503 pathogen reduction
requirements for land application of biosolids are divided into two cat-
egories: Class A and Class B biosolids. In addition to meetin g the require-
ment in one of the six treatment alternatives, the Class A requi rement
is to reduce the pathogens in biosolids (fecal coliform, or Salmonella sp.
bacteria, enteric viruses, parasites, and viable helminth ova) in biosolids
to below the detectable levels. When this goal is reached, Class A biosolids
can be applied without any pathogen-r elated restriction on the site. The
six treatment alternatives for bioso lids include: alternative 1, thermally842 Chapter 6treated; alternative 2, high pH–high temperature treatment; a lternative
3, other processes treatment; alternative 4, unknown processes; alter-
native 5, use of the processes to further reduce pathogens (PFRP); and
alternative 6, use of a process equivalent to PFRP.
Class A biosolids. The pathogen reduction requirements must be met for
all six alternatives (503.32a) and vector attraction reduct ion (503.33) for
Class A with respect to pathogens. Regardless of the alternativ e chosen,
either the FC density in the biosolids must be less than 1000 , the most
probable number (MPN) per gram dry total solids; or the density  of
Salmonella sp. in the biosolids must be less than 3 MPN per 4 g of dry
total solids. Either of these requirements must be met at one of th e fol-
lowing times: (1) when the biosolids are used or disposed of; (2) wh en the
biosolids are prepared for sale or give away in a bag or other c ontainer
for land application; or (3) when the biosolids or derived materi als are pre-
pared to meet the requirements for excellent quality biosolids.

been reduced to levels that are unlikely to pose a threat to publ ic
health and the environment under specific conditions of use. Cla ss B

Land application. Biosolids are applied to land, either to condition the
soil or to fertilize crops or other vegetation grown in the soil. Bi osolids
can be applied to land in bulk or sold or given away in ba gs or other con-
tainers. The application sites may be categorized as nonpublic  contact
sites (agricultural lands, forests, reclamation sites) and p ublic contact
sites (public parks, roadsides, golf courses, nurseries, lawn s, and home
gardens). In the United States, about half of the biosolids prod uced are
ultimately disposed of through land application.
Approximately one-third of the 5.4 million dry metric tons of wa ste-
water sludge produced annually in the US at POTWs is used for land
application. Of that, about two-thirds is applied on agric ultural lands
(US EPA, 1995). Land application of wastewater sludge has been  prac-
ticed for centuries in many countries, because the nutrients (n itrogen
and phosphorus) and organic matter in sludge can be beneficia lly uti-
lized to grow crops and vegetation. However, microorganisms (bacter ia,
viruses, protozoa, and other pathogens), heavy metals, and toxic  organic
chemicals are major public health concerns for land applica tion of
biosolids. Proper management of biosolids utilization is required.
The application rate of biosolids applied to agricultural lan d must be
equal to or less than the “agronomic rate”. The agronomic rate i s defined
in the Part 503 as the rate designed to provide the amount of ni trogen
needed by the crop or vegetation while minimizing the nitrogen in  the
biosolids passing below the root zone of the crop or vegetation and fl ow-
ing to the groundwater.
Biosolids may be sprayed or spread on the soil surface and left on the
surface (pasture, range land, lawn, forest), tilled into the soi l after being
applied, or injected directly below the surface. Land applicat ion of
biosolids must meet risk-based pollutant limits specified in the Part 503.
Operation standards are to control pathogens and to reduce the attrac-
tion of vectors. In addition, the application must meet the gen eral require-
ments, management practices, and the monitoring, record keepin g, and
reporting requirements.
All land application of biosolids must meet the ceiling concen tration
limits for 10 heavy metals, listed in the second column of Tab le 6.28. If a
limit for any one of the pollutants is exceeded, the biosolids can not be
applied to the land until such time that the ceiling concen tration limits are
no longer exceeded.
Biosolids applied to the land also must meet either pollutant concen-
tration (PC) limits, cumulative pollutant loading rate (CPLR) l imits, or
annual pollutant loading rate limits for these 10 heavy meta ls. EitherWastewater Engineering 845Class A or Class B pathogen requirements and site restriction s must be
met. Finally, one of 10 options for vector attraction reduction mu st also
be met.
Annual whole sludge application rate. The annual whole sludge applica-
tion rate (AWSAR) for biosolids sold or given away in a bag or ot her
container for application to land can be determined by dividi ng
the annual pollutant loading rate by pollutant concentrat ion. It is
expressed as

Site evaluation and selection. Details of site evaluation and the selection
process are discussed by Federal Register (1993) and by the US EPA
(1995). The discussion covers Part 503 requirements, preliminar y plan-
ning, phases 1 and 2, site evaluation, and site screening.
Calculation of annual biosolids application rate on agricultural land .Sewage
sludge has been applied to agricultural land for a long tim e. The use
of biosolids in agricultural land can partially replace c ostly commercial
fertilizers. Generally, the intention is to optimize crop yields w ith appli-
cation of biosolids and if required, supplemental fertilizers. The annual
application rates of biosolids should not exceed the nutrients (N  and P)
requirements of the crop grown on an agricultural soil. In ad dition, land
application of biosolids must meet the Part 503 requirements st ated
above.
Calculation based on nitrogen. In order to prevent groundwater contam-
ination by ammonia nitrogen due to excess land application of biosolids,
Part 503 requires that bulk biosolids be applied to a site a t a rate equal
to or less than the agronomic rate for nitrogen at the site. 51.28 ton/1000 ft2/y 52560 lb/1000 ft2/y 5s125 metric ton/ sha#yd3s2205 lb/metric ton d

ammonium (NH4) or nitrate (NO3), or in organic forms. NO3-N is the
most water-soluble form of N, and is of most concern for groundwater
contamination. NH4-N can readily be volatilized as ammonia. Inorganic
N is the plant available nitrogen (PAN). Not all the N in b iosolids is
immediately available for crop use, because some N is present as  diffi-
culty decomposable (refratory) organic N (Org-N), Org-N /H11005 total N /H11002
(NO3-N) /H11002(NH4-N) which is in microbial cell tissue and other organic
compounds. Organic N must be decomposed into mineral or inorga nic
forms, such as NH4-N and NO3, before it can be used by plants. Thus,
the availability of Org-N for crops depends on the microbial br eakdown
of organic materials (biosolids, manure, crop residuals, soil organics, etc.)
in soil.
When calculating the agronomic N rate for biosolids, the residu al N
from previously applied biosolids that will be mineralized and  released as
PAN must be accounted for as part of the overall budget for the t otal PAN.
The residual N credit can be estimated for some sites undergoing soil
nitrate tests, but the PAN credit is commonly estimated by multiplying a
mineralization factor (Kmin) by the amount of biosolids Org-N still remain-
ing in the soil 1 or 2 years after biosolids application. Mi neralization fac-
tors for different types of biosolids may be found in Table 6.29.
Example 1: An aerobic digested biosolid with 2.8% of organic nitrogen was
applied at a rate of 4.5 dry ton per acre for the 1997 growing  season. No other
biosolids were applied to the same land in 1998. Determine the amount of
plant-available nitrogen that will be mineralized from the bios olids Org-N in
1997 for the 1999 growing season.

growing seasons as follows:
Answer: Org-N released as PAN in 1999 /H1100512 lb/acre ( as bold shown above ).
The NH4-N and N03-N added by biosolids is considered to be available
for plant use. Plant-available nitrogen comprises NH4-N and N03-N pro-
vided by biosolids and by fertilizer salts or other sources of th ese mineral
forms of N.
When biosolids or animal manure are applied on a soil surface, the
amount of PAN is reduced by the amount of NH4-N lost by volatilization of
ammonia. The volatilization factor, Kvolis used for estimating the amount
of NH4-N.
The PAN of biosolids for the first year of application may be deter-
mined as

It is necessary to determine the adjusted fertilizer N rate by s ubtracting
“total N available from existing, anticipated, and planned  sources” from the
total N requirement. The procedures to compute the adjusted fertili zer N
requirement for the crop to be grown may be summarized as follows (U S
EPA, 1995).
1. Determine the total N requirement (lb/ton) of crop to be grown. Thi s
value can be obtained from the Cooperative Extension Service of agri -
cultural agents or universities, USDA-Natural Resources Cons ervation
Service, or other agronomy professionals.
2. Determine N provided from other N sources added or mineralized in
the soil
a. N from a previous legume crop (legume credit) or green manure crop
b. N from supplemental fertilizers already added or expected to be a dded850 Chapter 6c. N that will be added by irrigation water
d. Estimate of available N from previous biosolids application (Example 1)

stituted in place of (a /H11001d /H11001e) if test is conducted properly; do not use
this test value if estimates for a, d, and e are used]

Finally, the agronomic N application rate of biosolids can be calculated
by dividing the adjusted fertilizer N required (step 4 above) by  PAN
(using Eq. (6.220)).
Example 3: Determine the agronomic N rate from Example 2, assuming the
adjusted fertilizer N rate is 61 lb/acre (68.3 kg/ha). The soli ds content of the
biosolids is 4.3%.

Calculation based on phosphorus. The majority of phosphorus (P) in
biosolids is present as inorganic forms, resulting from minera lization of
biosolids organic matter. Generally, the P concentration in bi osolids is
considered to be about 50% available for plant uptake, as is t he P normallyWastewater Engineering 851applied to soils with commercial fertilizers. The P fertilizer requi red for
the crop to be grown is determined from the soil fertility test for avail-
able P and the crop yield. The agronomic P rate of biosolids for lan d
application is expressed as (US EPA, 1995)
Agronomic P rate /H11005Preq/H11004(available P2O5/dry ton) (6.221)

If biosolids application rates are based on the crop’s P requir ement,
supplemental N fertilization is needed to optimize crop yield for nea rly
all biosolids applications.
Calculation based on pollutant limitation. Most biosolids are likely to contain
heavy metals concentrations that do not exceed the Part 503 poll utant
concentration limits. Therefore, pollutant loading limits are n ot a limit-
ing factor for determining annual biosolids application rates  on agricul-
tural lands. Biosolids meeting pollutant concentration limi ts, as well as
certain pathogen and vector attraction reduction requirements,  gener-
ally are subject to meet the the CPLRs requirement. A CPLR is the m ax-
imum amount of a pollutant that can be applied to a site by  all bulk
biosolids applications after July 20, 1993. When the maximu m CPLR is
reached at the application site for any one of the 10 metals regu lated by
Part 503 (molybdenum was deleted with effect from February 25, 199 4),
no more additional biosolids are allowed to be applied to the sit e.
For some biosolids with one or more of the pollutant concentrations
exceeding the Part 503 pollutant concentration limits, the CPLR s as
shown in Table 6.30 must be met. In these cases, the CPLRs cou ld even-
tually be the limiting factor for annual biosolids applicat ions rather
than the agronomic (N or P) rate of application.
For biosolids meeting the Part 503 CPLRs, the maximum total qua n-
tity of biosolids allowed to be applied to a site can be calcul ated on the
basis of the CPLR and the pollutant concentration in the biosoli ds as
follows:
Maximum allowed in dry ton/acre
/H11005(CPLR in lb/acre) /H11004[0.002 (mg pollutant/kg dry biosolids)] (6.224)852 Chapter 6After computing for each of the eight or nine pollutants regulated  by the
Part 503, the lowest total biosolids value will be used as th e maximum
quantity of biosolids permitted to be applied to the site. The in dividual
pollutant loading applied by each biosolids application ca n be calcu-
lated by
lb of pollutant/acre /H11005biosolids application rate in dry ton/acre
/H11003(0.002 mg/kg) (6.225)
The pollutant loading for each individual biosolid applicati on must be
calculated and recorded to keep a cumulative summation of the t otal
quantity of each pollutant that has been applied to each sit e receiving
the biosolids.
Supplemental K fertilizer. After the agronomic application rate of
biosolids has been determined, the amounts of plant available N , P, and
K added by the biosolids must be computed and compared to the fer-
tilizer recommendation for the crop grown at a specified yield level . If
one or more of these three nutrients provided by the biosolids is les s
than the amount recommended, supplemental fertilizers are needed to
achieve crop yield.
Potassium, K, is a soluble nutrient. Most of the concentration of K in
raw wastewater is discharged with the treatment plant effluen ts.
Generally, biosolids contain low concentrations of potassium, w hich is
one of the major plant nutrients. Fertilizer potash (K2O) or other sourcesWastewater Engineering 853

biosolid annual application for the 1999 growing season for an  agricultural
site on the basis of the agronomic N rate, P rate, and long-term pollutant
limitations required by Part 503. Also determine the supplemen tal nutrients
to be added. An anaerobically digested liquid biosolid is des igned to be applied854 Chapter 6to farmland at 10 dry ton/acre. The results of laboratory anal yses for the
biosolids are shown below:
If plant nutrients added by biosolids application are not s ufficient, sup-
plemental fertilizer nutrients must be provided. Routine soil fert ility tests,
monitoring, and records must meet Part 503 and state agency requirements.
The field is divided into two portions for rotating cropping of cor n, soybeans,
and wheat. The same biosolids have been applied to the field duri ng the pre-

For the 1999 growing season, one-half of the field will be planted i n wheat
and liquid biosolids will be injected to the soil in the fall  (1998) after soybeans
are harvested and before the winter wheat is planted in the fall  of 1998. For
the corn fields, biosolids will be surface applied and tilled in the spring of 1999
before corn is planted. There will be no other source of N for the corn field,

8. Convert biosolids rate into gal/acre /H110054320 gal/acre
Step 2. Determine cumulative pollution loading and maximum p ermitted
application rate
(a) Comparing the pollutants concentration in biosolid with t he Part 503 pol-
lutant concentration limits, and comparing the concentrati ons of the 10
heavy metals in the biosolid with the Part 503 “CPLR limits”  (Table 6.28),
the results show that all heavy metals concentrations in bi osolids are less
than the limits, except for zinc; therefore, the CPLR limits must  be met
for the biosolids.
(b) Compute the maximum permitted biosolids application rate for  each pol-
lutant. The maximum total amount of biosolids permitted to be a pplied
to soil can be calculated from the CPLR limits from Table 6.30 and the
concentrations of pollutants, using Eq. (6.224).
The maximum biosolids application rate allows for
As /H1100537 lb/acre ÷ [0.002 (10 mg/kg)] /H110051850 dry ton/acre

Zn /H110052500 lb/acre ÷ [0.002 (3400 mg/kg)] /H11005367 dry ton/acre
Note : Zn is the lowest allowed application rate, and it is much  higher
than the agronomic N rate. Thus heavy metal pollutants are n ot the limit
factor.858 Chapter 6(c) Compute the amount of each pollutant in the 1999 growing sea son
According to Part 503, the pollutant loading for each biosolid app lication
must be calculated and recorded to keep a cumulative summati on of the total
amount of each pollution. The amount of each pollutant can be calcul ated, using
Eq. (6.225), from the given pollutant concentrations for corn an d wheat fields.
The results are shown below.
(d) Estimate the number of years biosolids can be applied
Assume that biosolids continue to have the same quality over t ime, and
zinc would continue to be the limiting pollutant (see Step 2 b,  367 dry ton/acre
is the maximum biosolids application rate for zinc). For this example, it
is assumed that an average rate of 1.4 dry ton (acre /H11080yr) would be applied
over time. The number of years biosolid could be applied before reachi ng
the CPLR can be computed from maximum biosolid allowed, divided by
the average annual application rate, as follows:
Number of years /H11005367 dry ton/acre /H110041.4 dry ton/(acre /H11080yr)
/H11005262 years
Step 3. Compute the agronomic P rate for each field
(a) The total P2O5can be computed by Eq. (6.223). Given that anaerobic
biosolids have 2.2% total P

For the wheat field
Agronomic P rate /H1100580 ÷ 50
/H110051.6 dry ton/acre
Step 4. Determine the application rate of biosolid on the corn field
Because the agronomic P rate for the corn field (1.4 dry ton/acre) i s less than
the agronomic N rate (4.1 dry ton/acre, Step l f-6), this rate,  1.4 dry ton/acre,
is selected to be used for the 1999 growing season. A supplemental  N fertil-
izer must be added to fulfill the remaining N needs for corn not s upplied by
the biosolid.
Step 5. Determine the supplemental N fertilizer for the corn field
The amount of additional N needed for the corn can be computed by m ulti-
plying the PAN in lb/dry ton by the rate of biosolids appli cation, then sub-
tracting this PAN in lb/acre from the adjusted fertilizer N requirement.
Referring to Step l c and Step 1 f-4, supplemental N can be det ermined as
Biosolids N credit /H1100529 lb PAN/dry ton /H110031.4 dry ton/acre

Supplemental N /H11005119 lb/acre /H1100241 lb/acre
/H1100578 lb/acre

Step 7. Determine the application rate of biosolid for the wheat field
For the wheat field, the agronomic N rate of 1.0 dry ton/acre of bi osolids appli-
cation is the choice since it is less than the agronomic P ra te (1.6 dry ton/acre).
Step 8. Determine the supplemental P for the wheat field, referring t o

30 Wetlands
Wetlands are defined in Federal Register (40 CFR 230.3(t)) as “thos e
areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwa ter at the
frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal cir-
cumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically ad apted for
life in saturated soil conditions.”
Since the early 1950s, researches have been conducted on treatmen t
capacity and ecological impacts of wetlands for wastewater tr eatment.
The results of researches indicated that natural and man-made (con-
structed) wetlands can treat domestic wastewater and plant effluent (for
polishing) effectively to remove BOD5, TSS, nutrients (N and P), and
color. The wetlands treatments included for domestic, industria l, and
agricultural wastewaters.Wastewater Engineering 861In the early 1980s, the US EPA published a comprehensive lit erature
review on the effects of wastewater treatment on wetlands (US EPA,
1983), the ecological impacts of wastewater on wetlands—an annot ated
bibliography (US EPA, 1984a) and the wetland evaluation met hodolo-
gies (US EPA, 1984b).
The wetland treatment of wastewater had gained acceptance, espe-
cially for small communities with strained capital and O  & M costs with
available large land available. In a wetland, the aquati c system treats
wastewater by means of both physical sedimentation and bacter ial
metabolism that are similar to the conventional wastewater tr eatment.
The first design manual on wetlands and aquatic plant sys tems for
municipal wastewater treatments was published by the US E PA (1988).
Later a more comprehensive manual of constructed wetlands treatmen t
of municipal wastewaters was published (US EPA, 2000). In its 1994
report, the US EPA was considering wetlands at CERCLA (the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act, or Superfund) sites (US EPA, 1994).
There are three categories of aquatic wastewater treatment systems
(US EPA, 1988):
1. Natural wetlands
2. Aquatic plant systems
3. Constructed wetlands
30.1 Natural wetlands
Natural wetlands are referred to as marshes, swamps, bogs, a nd similar
areas with native vegetation. They are existing wetlands that  had little
or no modification by humans. Grasses or forbs (nonwoody plants) are
generally dominant in marshes; trees and shrubs grow in sw amp area;
and sedge and peat vegetations occur in various bogs. The modifi cation
or direct use of natural wetlands for wastewater treatment is d iscouraged.
Natural wetlands are effective as wastewater treatment. The percen t
removals of some parameters by natural wetlands are (Reed et al. , 1979):
BOD5: 70 to 96
TSS: 60 to 90
Nitrogen: 40 to 90
Phosphorus: 19 to 98 (seasonal)
30.2 Aquatic plant systems
Aquatic plant systems are shallow ponds with floating or s ubmerged
aquatic plants. Water hyacinth and duckweed are the most thoroughly862 Chapter 6studied floating plant systems. These systems are usually us ed for
advanced treatment of secondary effluent or in oxidation ponds for p ol-
ishing purposes. The plants derive the needed carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere and use nutrients in the water. The water hyacinth  has
rapid growth with an extensive root system to support media for  bac-
teria. It is temperature sensitive and is rapidly killed b y frost. Removal
of dead plants is cumbersome.
Duckweed occurs in natural wetlands and in lagoons (common a t the
highway rest areas). It is less sensitive to cold weather. Howev er, it has
a shallow root system, is sensitive to wind, and is easily flushed away
by high wind .
The second type of aquatic system is the submerged plant system .
Submerged plants are either rooted in the bottom sediments or sus -
pended in the water column. Typically, photosynthesis in th ese plants
occurs in the water column. Submerged plants are relatively easily
inhibited by high turbidity in the water. These plants ten d to be shaded
by algal growths and are killed by anaerobic conditions.
30.3 Constructed wetlands
Artificial (constructed) wetlands are wetlands that have been built or
extensively modified by humans. Modification examples are fillin g,
draining, or altering the flow patterns or physical properti es of the wet-
land. They are typically constructed with uniform depths an d regular
shapes near the source of the wastewater and are often located in u pland
areas where no wetlands have historically existed. Constructed  wet-
lands are almost always regulated as wastewater treatment fa cilities
and cannot be used for compensatory mitigation. Constructed wet lands
that provide advanced treatment to wastewater that has been p re-
treated to secondary levels, and also other benefits such as wil dlife habi-
tat, research laboratories, or recreational uses, are sometimes c alled
enhancement wetlands.
Constructed wetlands have been classified into two types (US EP A,
2000); namely, free water surface (FWS) wetlands and vegetated sub-
merged bed (VSB) wetland systems. The FWS wetlands (Fig. 6.63)  al so
known as surface flow wetlands, closely resembling natural wet lands in
appearance because they contain aquatic plants that are root ed in a soil
layer on the bottom of the wetland with water flowing through th e
leaves and stems of plants.
Vegetated submerged bed systems (Fig. 6.64), also known as subs ur-
face flow wetlands) do not resemble natural wetlands because they have
no standing water. They contain a bed of media (such as crush ed rock,
small stones, gravel, sand, or soil) that has been planted w ith aquatic
plants. When properly designed and operated, wastewater stays beneathWastewater Engineering 863the surface of the media, flows in contact with the roots and rh izomes
of the plants, and is not visible or available to wildlife.
Unlike natural wetlands, constructed wetlands are designed and oper-
ated to meet certain performance standards. The constructed wetla nd,
once designed and operated, requires regular monitoring to ensure
proper operation and routine management to maintain optimum per -
formance. On the basis of monitoring results, the system may n eed
minor modifications.
Environmental and health considerations. Since wetland systems affect
aesthetic, ecological, and recreational impacts in the area, during the
planning of constructed wetland, some technical, environmental , and864 Chapter 6
Figure 6.63 Elements of a free water surface (FWS) constructed wetland ( source:
US EPA 2001 ).
Figure 6.64 Elements of a vegetated submerged bed (VSB) system ( source :US EPA 2001 ).health factors have to be considered and evaluated. Those factors a re
(US EPA, 1983, 1984b, 1988, 2000):
■regulatory issues,
■uses of constructed wetland,
■changes in hydrologic regime,
■cumulative impacts of inorganic and organic chemicals,
■long-term biological effects,
■mitigation/management issues, and
■health/disease considerations.
Constructed wetland is relatively less regulated than a conv entional
wastewater treatment system. It is a reliable, affordable, and  operable
process for a small (less than 1 MGD or 3800 m3/d) wastewater treat-
ment plant. Constructed wetlands are also versatile, to be us ed either
as the primary means of secondary treatment or as a means of fin al pol-
ishing. Nowadays, the use of a constructed wetland is not un iformly
accepted as a proven technology or an emerging treatment technolog y
depending upon regulatory agencies. It has some degree of risks t o
ecosystem and toxic compounds (still unknown). Also, the design  process
is still empirical.
Sources of surface water and groundwater supplies have to be stu d-
ied, including charge and discharge. Sequential changes of the hydrologic
regime in the wetland affect all aspects of the ecosystem. These cha nges
must be understood to determine nutrient cycle, sedimentation ra tes, ero-
sion patterns, plant and animal community compositions, a nd hydro-
logical budgets. These effects ultimately depend on the loading ra te,
discharge quantity and quality, and size and type of receiv ing wetland.
Wetlands achieve good removal of nitrogen via denitrification.
Phosphorus removal is more variable. Wetlands have some ability  to
assimilate organic and other compounds, and change soil chem istry. These
may cause the shift of dominant animal and plant species com position,
especially benthic invertebrate communities. Some metals do acc umulate
within wetlands. Various physical and chemical parameter s affect bioac-
cumulation. Refractory chemicals, such as surfactants, ph enols, pesti-
cides, etc., are typically accumulated in wetlands. The lon g-term ecological
effects of these accumulation are less known.
Shifts in plant species composition and area distribution w ill change
in biomass production, detrital cycle habitat, aquatic food  chain (web),
wildlife, animal, and fish species and population. Eventual ly these may
reduce water quality. The pathogens of concern in wetland treatm ent
system are bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Disease-carryi ng insect vec-
tors are potential risks.Wastewater Engineering 865Wetland-related recreational activities, such as canoeing, ph otogra-
phy, bird watching, camping, etc., should be evaluated. Cultivated crops,
pasture, hay crops, and silviculture are most likely not a ffected by con-
structed wetlands. Natural landscape (any unique areas, a nd open
spaces), archaeological sites, and historical sites have to b e preserved.
The constructed wetlands should also be open for research and for p ublic
educational purposes.
Mitigation measures should be taken to avoid impacts on wetla nd from
operation of conventional treatment facilities. The impacts inclu de site
selection, construction of interceptors and pumping stations, discharge to
wetlands, included development, and increased human use of the area.
Free water surface wetlands. The differences between the two types of
wetlands were mentioned previously. Free water surface wetlands
closely resemble natural wetlands in appearance and function,  with a
combination of open-water areas, emergent vegetation, varying water
depths, and other typical wetland features. 
The main components of a FWS constructed wetland are sketched in
Fig. 6.63. A typical FWS constructed wetland consists of severa l com-
ponents that may be modified among various applications but retain
essentially the same features. These components include berms to
enclose the treatment cells, inlet structures that regulate an d distrib-
ute influent wastewater evenly for optimum treatment, various com bi-
nations of open-water areas and fully vegetated surface areas, and  outlet
structures that complement the even distribution provided by inlet
structures and allow the adjustment of water levels within t he treatment

Wetland hydrology. The wetland water balance for a FWS constructed
wetland is expressed as follows:
dV/dt/H11005Qi/H11001Qc/H11001Qsm/H11002Qb/H11002Qe/H11001(P/H11001ET /H11001I)A (6.228)
where V /H11005water volume or storage in wetland

Qb/H11005berm loss rate, m3/d or ft3/d

I/H11005infiltration to groundwater, m/d or ft/d
A/H11005wetland water surface area, m2or ft2866 Chapter 6The impact of wet weather and snowmelt on the wastewater flow is
external to the water balance. Some of the terms in Eq. (6.228) m ay be
deemed insignificant and can be neglected. Qband Ican be neglected if
the wetland is lined with an impermeable layer; snowmelt is important
only in certain locations.
The wetland water volume Vcan be calculated by multiplying aver-
age water depth Hby area A:
V/H11005A/H11003H (6.229)
Wetland porosity nor void fraction is the fraction of total volume
available through which water can flow. In a FWS wetland, v egetation,
settled solids, litter, and peat occupy water column. Wetlan d porosity
is difficult to measure in the field. For design purpose, it is recom-
mended to have a porosity value of 0.65 to 0.75 for fully vegetated
zones; 1.0 for wetland open-water zones; and around 0.88 for an aver -
age value. 
The average wastewater flow rate is the mean of the FWS influent Qi
and effluent Qeflow rates. It is expressed as:
Qave/H11005(Qi/H11001Qe)/2 (6.230)
The nominal hydraulic retention time (HRT) is defined as the ratio
of useable wetland water volume to the average flow rate. The theolog-
ical hydraulic retention time tis calculated as:
t/H11005V/H11003n/Qave (6.231)
The hydraulic loading rate ( q, in m/h or m3/m2/h) is the volumetric flow
rate divided by the wetland surface area and represents the dep th of
water distributed to the wetland surface over a specific time i nterval.
The hydraulic loading rate can be computed as:
q/H11005Qi/A (6.232)
Manning’s equation (Eq. (4.22b)), which defines flow in open cha nnel,
is adopted to estimate head loss in FWS wetland as follows:
S1/2/H11005v/(1/n)(H2/3) (6.233)
where S/H11005hydraulic gradient or slope of water surface
v/H11005average flow velocity, m/s or ft/s
n/H11005Manning’s resistance coefficient, s/m1/3
H/H11005average wetland depth, m or ft
A typical slope is of 1 in 10,000, or 1 cm in 100 m. The coeffi cient nis
a function of water depth and the resistance of specific surface. TheWastewater Engineering 867range of nvalues in wetland are 0.3 to 1.1 s/m1/3. Since multiple cells
are recommended as good design practice to minimize short-circuit ing
and to maximize treatment performance, for most applications wher e
aspect ratios (length/width) are within suggested limits of 3  : 1 to 5 : 1,
or even larger.
Design considerations. The design models and methods have been used
to predict the fate of BOD, TSS, TN, HN4, NO3, TP, and FCs in a FWS
system. The performances of the above parameters in both FWS and
VSB wetlands are discussed in detail elsewhere (US EPA, 2000 ). FWS
constructed wetlands have usually been modeled as attached gr owth bio-
logical reactors, in which the plants and detrital materi al uniformly
occupy the entire volume of the wetland.
For the purpose of providing secondary (BOD /H11005TSS /H1100530 mg/L) and
advanced secondary treatment of municipal wastewaters, no par ticular
equations alone are able to accurately predict the performance of a  mul-
tizone FWS constructed wetland. Even if they could be calibrated “to fit”
a specific set of data, their nondeterministic basis belies th eir ability to
fit other circumstances of operation.
The areal loading rate (ALR) method specifies a maximum loading
rate per unit area for a given constituent. These methods are comm on
in the design of oxidation ponds and land treatment systems. The ALR
can be used to give both planning level and final design sizi ng esti-
mates for FWS systems from projected pollutant mass loads. For exam -
ple, knowing the areal BOD loading rate, the expected BOD effluen t
concentration can be estimated or compared to the long-term averag e
performance data of other well-documented, full-scale operating sys-
tems. The ALR can be described as: 
ALR /H11005QiCi/A (6.234)
where Ci/H11005influent concentration of pollutant, mg/L
Qi/H11005incoming flow, m3/d or ft3/d
A/H11005total area of FWS, ha or acre
The ALR method does not always correlate to a reasonable design
basis, especially with regard to nutrients and pathogen rem oval; other
mechanistic explanations are necessary. However, if typical mu nicipal
wastewaters are to be treated that have total and filtered pollu tant
fractionation reasonably consistent from site to site, a rationa l design
approach can be deduced for those parameters which can be removed
during the enhanced flocculation/sedimentation that occurs in  the ini-
tial fully vegetated zone of a FWS constructed wetland. Therefore, based
on Figs. 6.63 and 6.65, the following areal loading rates ca n be used for
this initial zone (zone 1) of the FWS:868 Chapter 6Zone 1 areal loading rate
Parameter Effluent concentration, mg/L kg/ha /H11080 d lb/acre /H11080 d
BOD 30 40 35.7
TSS 30 30 26.8
The relative areal loadings imply that unless the pretreatment
processes were to have a BOD concentration of greater than 1.3 ti mes
the TSS concentration, the latter would be the critical loadin g rate for
the fully vegetated zone if secondary standards are to be met by a  fully
vegetated FWS system.
If the FWS system were to have significant open areas between fully
vegetated zones, a better effluent quality could be attained at ar eal
loadings, based on the entire FWS system area.
Areal loading rate
Parameter Effluent concentration, mg/L kg/ha /H11080d lb/acre /H11080d
BOD 30 60 53.6
BOD /H1102120 45 40.2
TSS 30 50 44.6
TSS /H1102120 30 26.8
The loading rates in the above table are based on the entire syst em
area, not just zone 1. Therefore, with open-water zones that provide
aerobic transformations and removal opportunities, a better effluen t
quality is achievable than with a fully vegetated FWS system . It is rec-
ommended that the minimum HRT at the maximum monthly flow in
both zones 1 and 3 (fully vegetated) be 2 days. The water depth sh ould
be 0.6 to 0.9 m. There are insufficient data at this time to el iminate
the need to provide effluent disinfection. The open-water zones would
attract wildlife to a great degree, and would be affected by thei r
activities.
A FWS constructed wetland is most likely to treat effluent from a
stabilization or oxidation pond, or from primary-treated (settled) munic-
ipal wastewater. After the designer determines overall size of the FWS
system from these BOD and TSS areal loading rates, the designer  can
return to evaluate the fate of other constituents. TSS removal and
removal of associated BOD, organic N and P, metals, etc. occu r in the
initial portion of the cell (Fig. 6.65), while the subsequent zones  can
impact certain soluble constituents. Given sufficient dissolv ed oxygen
in open (unvegetated) areas, soluble BOD removal and nitrificati on of
ammonia can occur. If sufficient oxygen is present, soluble BOD  can be
removed very slowly by anaerobic processes.Wastewater Engineering 869In zone 2, which is primarily open-water, the natural reaerat ion
processes are supplemented by submerged macrophytes during day -
light periods to elevate dissolved oxygen in order to oxidize carbon a-
ceous compounds (BOD) to sufficiently low levels to facilitate
nitrification of the NH4-N to NO3-N. These processes require large
amounts of oxygen and time in a passive system (no mechanical assis-
tance). The maximum HRT in zone 2 is generally limited to about 2  to
3 days before unwanted algal blooms occur. The water depth shoul d
be 1.2 to 1.5 m. Then, there are three cells in each train and  at least
two trains (unless very small system). Therefore, more than one open
zone may be required to complete these reactions. If so, the result
would be a five (or more) zone design; because each open zone is fol-
lowed by a fully vegetated zone. The reactions in zone 2 are essential ly
the same as in a facultative lagoon. Therefore, the first-order equat ion
for FC die-off could be applied as an approximation, along with i ts tem-
perature dependency as:

The reduction in wetland volume due to settled solids, living p lants,
and plant detritus can be significant over the long term. Th e rate of accu-
mulation of settled suspended solids is a function of the water t emper-
ature, the mass of influent TSS, the effectiveness of TSS removal, the
decay rate of the volatile fraction of the TSS, and the settled TSS mass
that is nonvolatile. The plant detritus buildup is a funct ion of the stand-
ing crop and the decay rate of the plant detritus. Accumula tion for emer-
gent vegetated areas of the Arcata enhancement wetlands was meas ured
to be approximately 12 mm/yr of detritus on the bottom due to pl ant
breakdown and 12 to 25 mm/yr of litter forming a thatch on t he surface
(Kadlecik, 1996). The volume of the living plants, specifically  the volume
of the emergent plants, ranged from 0.005 m3/m2(low stem density,
water depth of 0.3 m) to 0.078 m3/m2(high stem density, water depth of
0.75 m). This accumulation is more or less constant from year to year
as the wetland matures. The total volume reduction under the in itial
vegetated zone can be estimated using a mass balance equation:
Vr/H11005(Vsst/H11001Vdt) A (6.237)
where Vr/H11005volume reduction over the period of analysis, m3

Example 1: A reasonable default value for Vsswhen treating raw wastewater
in lagoons ranges from 200 to 400 m3/ha/H11080 yr (2 to 4 cm/yr). Therefore, a con-
servative default value of 150 m3/ha/H11080 yr can be used. The loss of volume per
hectare over an 8-year period for a 1-ha fully vegetated FWS wetland zone with
a depth of 0.75 m can be estimated by use of this equation. On e hundred per-
cent coverage of emergent vegetation was measured to contribute 116 m3/ ha/H11080 yr
of bottom detritus, and 104 m3/ha /H11080 yr of surface litter with a standing crop
volume of 360 m3/ha. Estimate the loss of volume per hectare over an 8-year
period for a 1-ha fully vegetated FWS wetland zone with a depth of 0. 75 m. Ce

Example 2: Design a FWS constructed wetland to treat lagoon effluent to

Given the design conditions: population /H1100542,000 people; the average annual

At Qave: the influent BOD /H1100555 mg/L, while the average TSS /H1100566 mg/L; at the
maximum monthly flow: the BOD /H1100538 mg/L and TSS /H1100532 mg/L, respec-
tively; the maximum ALRs are 40 kg BOD/ha /H11080d and 30 kg TSS/ha /H11080 d for a
single cell; and the maximum ALRs are 60 kg BOD/ha /H11080d and 50 kg TSS/ha /H11080d
for with open areas.

Step 1a. Determine the total area required under the critical c ondition for
a single cell 
Rearranging Eq. (6.234),
A/H11005QiCi/ALR
For BOD yields: at Qave
A/H1100515,900 m3/d /H11003 1000 L/m3/H1100355 mg/L/(40 kg/ha /H11080 d /H11003106mg/kg)

35.0 ha are required to meet the secondary effluent standards us ing a fully
vegetated single-zone FWS wetland system.
Step 1b. Similarly, recalculate the total area required from t he higher
ALRs for the FWS system with significant open areas between fully vege-
tated zones
For BOD yields: at Qave

A/H1100531,800 /H110031000 /H1100338/(60 /H11003106) /H1100520.1 (ha)
For TSS yields:  at Qave
A/H1100515,900 /H110031000 /H1100366/(50 /H11003106) /H1100521.0 (ha)

A/H1100531,800 /H110031000 /H1100332/(50 /H11003106) /H1100520.4 (ha)
The limiting condition is still the TSS areal loading at th e average flow con-
ditions. But, the total area requirement is only 21.0 ha in stead of 35.0 ha.
Step 2. Compute the theoretical HRT assuming H/H110050.6 and n/H110050.75 in the
vegetative zones (1 and 3) and H/H110051.3 m and n/H110051.0 in the open zone 2. The
combined average depth is estimated of 0.84 m and an average n/H110050.82. Using
Eq. (6.231), for Qave
t/H11005V/H11003n/Qave/H11005A/H11003H/H11003n/Qave
/H1100521 ha /H1100310,000 m2/ha /H110030.84 m /H110030.82/15,900 m3/d
/H110059.1 days
for Qmax t/H1100521 /H1100310000 /H110030.84 /H110030.82/31,800 /H110054.55 days
Note : The above implies that at Qmax, the HRT may not be adequate for the
necessary treatment mechanisms to perform. For zone 1, the minimum  HRT
at Qmax should be at least 2 days with 4 days at Qave. For zone 2, there is an
upper limit that depends on climate and temperature. For most US conditions,
a maximum HRT of 2 to 3 days should avoid algal blooms (a load  to zone 3);
although the longer the HRT, the better the removal for soluble orga nics,
ammonia-N, and bacteria. Zone 3 should have the same considera tions as
zone 1. It also provides denitrification. 
Therefore, the minimum HRT at Qmaxis 6 (2 /H110012 /H110012) days, and 12 days
at Qaveas in this example. Wastewater Engineering 873Step 3. Use t/H1100512 days to determine the area Arequired at Qave   
Substituting Eq. (6.229) into Eq. (6.231) and rearranging  it,
A/H11005t Q/nH /H1100512 days /H1100315,900 m3/d/(0.82 /H110030.84 m /H1100310,000 m2/ha)
/H1100527.7 ha (say 28 ha /H1100569 acres)
Applying the normal additional area for the inlet, buffers, an d outlet of a factor
ranging from 1.25 to 1.40, the total area required for the FWS w etland is
35 ha (28 ha /H110031.25) or 86.5 acres.
Step 4. Configuration:  The FWS system should be designed at least  with
two parallel treatment trains of a minimum of three cells in ea ch. Say for 2
trains, for this example, the area of each train would be 14 h a /H11005140,000 m2. 
The shapes of the system can be squares, rectangles, polygons, ov als, kidney
shapes, and crescent shapes. Let us select rectangles. The optim um aspect
ratio, or average length Lto average width W, ranges 3 : 1 to 5 : 1. If the
ratio ≥ 10, we may need to calculate backwater curves. Usi ng L: W/H110054 : 1,
then  4 W2/H11005140,000 m2. We obtain W/H11005187 m and L/H11005748 m (only for 3 cells).
Say each cell has 250 m in length. By adding 25% of length  for the inlet and
outlet zones, the total length for the system is 937 m.
In summary, the FWS system includes 2 trains. Each train  has 187-m
width and contains inlet zones, 3 treatment zones (1, 2, and 3 ), and outlet
zones. The lengths of each zone respectively are of 87, 250, 250, 250 , and 90 m.
The depths of each zone respectively are of 1.0, 0.6, 1.3, 0.6, an d 0.6 m.
Note : To effectively minimize short-circuiting with baffles in the FWS
system, the inlet/outlet structures should be designed for unifor m distribu-
tion of inflow across the entire width of the wetland inlet and u niform col-
lection of effluent across the entire wetland outlet width. An inl et-settling
structure may be needed if there is high TSS in the influent. Th e outlet weir
loading should be /H11349200 m3/m /H11080d.
Multiple cells allow for redistribution of the primary cell efflu ent in the sub-
sequent cell that reduces short-circuiting. Flexible intercell piping will facil-
itate maintenance without a major reduction in the necessary HRT to produce
satisfactory effluent quality. Aspect ratios of the cells should  be greater than
3:1 and adapted to the site contours and restrictions. Addi tional treatment
will likely be required alter the FWS system to meet fecal coliform and dis-
solved oxygen permit requirements.
Example 3: Use the same design conditions as Example 2. Design a FWS
wetland system to meet 20-20 (both BOD and TSS ≤ 20 mg/L) effluent  stan-
dards, i.e. to meet this effluent quality, an open-water zone is r equired in the
FWS wetland. The maximum ALRs are 45-kg BOD/ha /H11080 d and 30-kg TSS/
ha/H11080 d for the system.

A/H1100531,800 /H110031000 /H1100332/(30 /H11003106) /H1100533.9 ha
The limiting factor is again the TSS loading at average flow c onditions where
35.0 ha are required to meet the more stringent effluent standard s.
Step 2. Compute the theoretical HRT, t, required for the entire 3-zone FWS
system, assuming an overall average depth, H/H110050.84 m and an average n/H11005
0.82. Using Eq. (6.231)
for Qave

/H1100515.2 days
for Qmax
t/H1100515.2 days/2 /H110057.6 days
Step 3. Determine the area required for each cell (zone)
At maximum monthly flow rate, assuming an equal minimum HRT ( t/H110057.6
days/3 /H110052.53 days) in each of 3 cells 
for zone 2,
A2/H11005t Q/nH /H110052.53 days /H1100331,800 m3/d/(1.0 /H110031.3 m /H1100310,000 m2/ha)
/H110056.2 ha
Then, area for zone 1 ( A1) and zone 3 ( A3) would be
A1 /H11005A3/H11005(35.0 ha /H110026.2 ha)/2 /H1100514.4 ha
Step 4. Determine the zone dimensions
Say the total area required for the 3 treatment zones is 35 ha (8 6.5 acres).
By adding in 25% of it, the overall FWS wetland area includin g inlet/outlet
zones would be 43.8 ha (108 acres). Wastewater Engineering 875Again use two parallel trains (17.5 ha each) and aspect ra tio of 4 : 1;
then, 4 W2/H11005175,000 m2. We obtain W/H11005209 m and L/H11005836 m (only for
3 cells). Approximately, the lengths of zones 1, 2, and 3 are 3 18, 200, and
318 m, respectively. By adding 25% of the length for the inlet and outlet
zones, the total length for the system is 1045 m. The length of th e inlet
and outlet zones may be 109 and 100 m, respectively. The depths  of the
inlet, 3 treatment, and outlet zones respectively are of 1.0, 0.6 , 1.3, 0.6,
and 0.6 m.
Vegetated submerged bed systems. The VSB wetlands are composed of
gravel beds that may be planted with wetland vegetation. Fig ure 6.64
illustrates a schematic sketch of a VSB wetland system. Ty pical VSB
components include (1) inlet piping, (2) a clay or synthetic m embrane
lined basin, (3) loose media filling the basin, (4) wetland veget ation
planted in the media, and (5) outlet piping with a water-level  control
system. The outlet structures are designated  for regulation and  distri-
bution of wastewater flow. VSB wetlands may contain berms.  I n addi-
tion to shape and size, other variable factors are choice of treatm ent
media (gravel shape and size, for example) as an economic factor an d
selection of vegetation as an optional feature that affects wetland aes-
thetics more than its performance. 
The pollutant removal performance of VSB systems depends on many
factors including influent wastewater quality, hydraulic and pollutant
loading, climate, and physical characteristics of the sys tems. The main
advantage of a VSB system over a free water surface wetland syst em is
the isolation of the wastewater from vectors, animals, and huma ns.
Concerns with mosquitoes and pathogen transmission are greatl y
reduced with a VSB system. Properly designed and operated VSB sys-
tems may not need to be fenced off or otherwise isolated from people and
animals. Comparing conventional VSB systems to FWS systems of the
same size, VSB systems typically cost more to construct, pri marily
because of the cost of media (Reed et al. , 1995). 
It is not clear if it is desirable to maintain a single pl ant species, or a
prescribed collection of plant species, for any treatment purpose.  Single
plant (monoculture) systems are more susceptible to catastrophic  plant
death due to predation or disease (George et al. , 2000). It is generally
assumed that multiple plant and native plant systems ar e less suscep-
tible to catastrophic plant death, although no studies hav e confirmed
this assumption. Plant invasion and plant dominance furth er compli-
cate the issue. 
It was found that the roots do not fully penetrate to the bottom of the
media and there is substantially more flow under the root zone th an
through it (Young et al. , 2000). The oxygen supply from the roots is also
likely to be unreliable due to yearly plant senescence, plant d ie-off due876 Chapter 6to disease and pests, and variable plant coverage from year to year.
Considering all of these factors, it is recommended that designer s
assume wetland plants provide no significant amounts of oxygen  to a
VSB system. The impact of wetland plants on pollutant removal  per-
formance appears to be minimal, based on current knowledge; so, the
selection of plants species should be based on aesthetics, impac ts on
operation, and long-term plant health and viability in a g iven geo-
graphical area. Local wetland plants experts should be consu lted when
making the selection.
Hydrology. As in all gravity flow systems, the water level in a VSB
system is controlled by the outlet elevation and the hydraulic  gradient,
or slope, that is the drop in the water level (head loss) over the length
from the inlet to the outlet. The relationship between the hydrauli c gra-
dient and the flow through a porous media is typically descr ibed by the
general form of Darcy’s law (Eq. (6.238)). This model assumes lam inar
flow through the media finer than coarse gravel. It is recommend ed
without modification of the general form as sufficient to estimate t he
water level within a VSB system. Darcy’s law is a functi on of the flow,
ALR, water depth, and hydraulic conductivity.

The water level at the inlet of a VSB will rise to the elevation r equired
to overcome the head loss in the entire VSB system. It should be
designed to prevent surfacing. Kfor an operating VSB varies with time
and location within the media and will have a major impac t on the head
loss. Kis very difficult to determine because it is influenced by factor sWastewater Engineering 877that cannot be easily accounted for, including flow patterns (affected by
preferential flow and short-circuiting), and clogging (affected by  changes
in root growth/death and solids accumulation/degradation). Th erefore,
a value must be assumed for design purposes. Typical clean Kvalues
vary for various sizes of rock and gravel. They are 6200, 21,00 0, 34,000,
64,000, 100,000, and 120,000 m/d for 5 mm pea gravel, 6  mm pea gravel,
5 to 10 mm gravel, 22 mm coarse gravel, 17 mm creek rock, a nd 19 mm
rock, respectively. Based on the studies and many observed cas es of
surfacing in VSB systems, the following conservative values a re rec-
ommend for the long-term operating Kvalues (US EPA, 2000):
Initial 30% of VSB Ki/H110051% of clean K
Final 70% of VSB Kf/H1100510% of clean K
Design consideration
Media. The media of a VSB system perform several functions: They
(1) are rooting material for vegetation, (2) help to evenly distri bute/col-
lect flow at the inlet/outlet, (3) provide surface area for microbia l growth,
and (4) filter and trap particles. For successful plant estab lishment, the
uppermost layer of media should be conducive to root growth. A var iety
of media sizes and materials have been tried, but there is no cl ear evi-
dence that points to a single size or type of media, except that the media
should be large enough that it will not settle into the void s paces of the
underlying layer. 
It is recommended (US EPA, 2000) that the planting media wou ld be
5 to 20 mm (1/5 to 4/5 in) in diameter, and the minimum dep th should
be 100 mm (4 in). The media in the inlet and outlet zones (Fig. 6. 66)
should be between 40 and 80 mm (1.6 and 3.1 in) in diameter to mini-
mize clogging and should extend from the top to the bottom of the
system. All media must be washed clean of fines and debris; m ore
rounded media will generally have more void spaces; and media should
be resistant to crushing or breakage. The hydraulic conducti vity of the
20 to 30 mm diameter clean media is assumed as 100,000 m/ d.
Slopes. The top surface of the media should be leveled or nearly
leveled for easier planting and routine maintenance. Theoreticall y, the
bottom slope should match the slope of the water level to maintain  a uni-
form water depth throughout the VSB. However, because the hydraul ic
conductivity of the media varies with time and location, it is not prac-
tical to determine the bottom slope this way; the bottom slope sh ould
be designed only for draining the system, and not to supplement  the
hydraulic conductivity of the VSB. A practical approach i s to uniformly
slope the bottom along the direction of flow from inlet to outlet to al low
for easy draining when maintenance is required. No research ha s been878 Chapter 6done to determine an optimum slope, but Chalk and Wheale (1989)
recommended a slope of to 1% is for ease of construction and proper
draining.
System size. The surface area required is calculated based upon
desired effluent quality and areal loading rate. The ALRs for BOD  are
6 g/m2/H11080 d (53.5 lb/acre /H11080 d) and 1.6 g/m2/H11080 d (14.3 lb/acre /H11080 d) to attain 30
and 20 mg/L effluents, respectively. The ALR for TSS is 20 g/m2/H11080 d
(178 lb/acre /H11080 d) to attain 30 mg/L effluent. VSB system is not designed
for nutrients (N and P) removal.
There is no optimum depth for a VSB system. But the media depth
should be set equal to the maximum root depth of the wetland spec ies
to be used in the VSB. Typical average media depths in VSB systems
have ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 m (12 to 28 in), and various resea rchers have
recommended depths from 0.4 to 0.6 m (16 to 24 in). It is recomm ended
to use a design with maximum water depth (at the inlet of the VSB) of
0.50 m (20 in). The depth of the media will be defined by the level  of the
wastewater at the inlet and should be about 0.1 m (4 in) hig her than the
water.
The width of an individual VSB is set by the ability of the inlet and
outlet structures to uniformly distribute and collect the flow without
inducing short-circuiting. The width can be determined usin g Darcy’s
law (Eq. (6.238)). The recommended maximum width in a TVA design
manual is 61 m (200 ft). If the design produces a larger val ue, it should
divide the VSB into several cells that do not exceed 61 m in w idth—use
at least 2 VSBs in parallel; use an adjustable inlet devi ce with capabil-
ity to balance flows; and use an adjustable outlet control dev ice with
capability to flood and drain system.1

Figure 6.66 Proposed zones in a VSB.Several researchers have noted that most BOD and TSS are removed
in the first few meters of VSB, but some recommend minimum length s
ranging from 12 to 30 m (39 to 98 ft) to prevent short-circuiti ng. The min-
imum length recommended by the US EPA (2000) is 15 m (50 ft).
Therefore, the aspect ratio is not a factor in the overall size desig n.
However, the recommended values for maximum width and minimum
length tend to result in individual VSB cells with a leng th-width ratio
between 1 : 1 and 1 : 2.
Example: Design a VSB constructed wetland system with some assumpti ons
or given conditions:
■The total VSB has four zones as shown in Fig. 6.65. 
■The initial treatment zone 1 occupies about 30% of the total area, performs
most of the treatment, and has a big decrease in hydraulic c onductivity (use
K/H110051% of clean K). 
■The final treatment zone 2 will occupy the remaining 70% of the ar ea and
has little change in hydraulic conductivity (use K/H1100510% of clean K).
■Darcy’s law, while not exact, is good enough for design purpos es.

solution:
Step1. Determine the surface area for both BOD and TSS, using Eq . (6.234)
For BOD removal:
A/H11005QCi/ALR /H11005(380 m3/d /H1100384 g/m3)/6 g/m2/H11080d
/H110055320 m2
For TSS removal:
A/H11005(380 m3/d /H1100396 g/m3)/20 g/m2/H11080d
/H110051824 m2
Use the large area required, i.e. 5320 m2. The surface area for the initial
treatment zone 1 is A1/H110055320 m2/H110030.3 /H110051600 m2. The surface area for the
final treatment zone 2 is A2/H110055320 m2/H110030.7 /H110053720 m2.
Step 2. Determine the minimum width needed to keep the flow below th e
surface, using Eq. (6.240) and recommended values ( Ki /H110051000 m/d, D/H110050.44

Step. 5. Calculate bottom elevations
Let bottom elevation at the outlet, Eo/H110050 as reference point for all elevations.
s/H110050.005.  The elevation at the beginning of zone 2, Ef, is:
Ef  /H11005L2 /H11003s/H1100524.5 m /H110030.005 /H110050.12 m
The elevation at the inlet (the beginning of zone 1), Ei, is:
Ei/H11005(10.5 m /H1100124.5 m) /H110030.005 /H110050.18 m
Step 6. Determine the water surface elevations
The water surface elevation at the beginning of zone 2, Ewf, is:
Ewf /H11005Ef/H11001Df/H110050.12 m /H110010.44 m /H110050.56 m 
The water surface elevation at the outlet, Ewo, is:
Ewo /H11005Ewf/H11002 dh2/H110050.56 m /H110020.01 m (use 0.01 instead 0.014 from Step 4)
/H110050.55 m
The water surface elevation at the inlet, Ewi, is:
Ewi /H11005Ewf  /H11001dh1/H110050.56 m /H110010.06 m /H110050.62 m
Step 7. Compute water depth
The depth of water at the inlet, Di, is:
Di/H11005Ewi/H11002Ei/H110050.62 m /H11002 0.18 m /H110050.44 m (as designed)
The depth of water at the beginning of zone 2, Df, is:
Df/H11005Ewf/H11002 Ef/H110050.56 m /H11002 0.12 m /H110050.44 m (as designed)
The depth of water at the outlet, Do, is:
Do/H11005Ewo/H11002 Eo/H110050.55 m /H11002 0 m /H110050.55 m
Step 8. Determine the media depth
The media depth can be designed based on two concepts: (a) level th e media
surface and (b) a minimum depth to water throughout the VSB s ystem.882 Chapter 6a. Determine the media depth based on level surface
The elevation of media top must be greater than the highest water ele-
vation, i.e. at the inlet, Ewi /H110050.62 m.  Let us set the media top elevation
at 0.68 m. 
Then, the depth of media at the inlet, 
Dmi/H110050.68 m /H11002 Ei /H110050.68 m /H11002 0.18 m /H110050.50 m

Dmo/H110050.68 m /H11002 Eo /H110050.68 m /H11002 0 m /H110050.68 m
The media depth-to-water at the inlet, 
Dtwi/H110050.68 m /H11002 Ewi /H110050.68 m /H11002 0.62 m /H110050.06 m
The media depth-to-water at the beginning of zone 2, 
Dtwf/H110050.68 m /H11002 Ewf /H110050.68 m /H11002 0.56 m /H110050.12 m
The media depth-to-water at the outlet, 
Dtwo/H110050.68 m /H11002 Ewo/H110050.68 m /H11002 0.55 m /H110050.13 m
Note : The media depth-to-water is small at the inlet (0.06 m). However,  the
designer may want to add an additional layer of media in th e first few meters
of the initial treatment zone 1 as an added precaution against  surfacing,
even though the design ALR and Kvalues are very conservative. The result-
ing Dtwoin the final treatment zone 2 would be 0.12 to 0.13 m, which should
not inhibit the growth of aquatic species.
b. Determine the media depth based on a constant depth-to-water (us e 0.1 m)

The depth of media at the outlet, 
Dmo/H11005Emo /H11002Eo/H110050.65m /H110020 m /H110050.65 m
Note: This approach would result in a drop in the media surface of (Emi/H11002Dmi/H11005
0.72 m /H110020.54 m) 0.18 m over the 10.5-m length of the initial treatment  zone
(slope /H110051.7%), which would probably not impair operation and mainten ance
activities.
Step 9. Determine the number of cells
It is recommended that at least two VSBs be used in parallel  in all but the
smallest systems, so that one of the VSBs can be taken out of ser vice for main-
tenance or repairs without causing serious water quality vi olations. In this
example, the total size of the treatment zones is 152 m wide and 3 5 (10.5 /H11001
24.5) m long. Therefore, four VSB trains, each 38 m wide and 35  m long, could
be used. Other combinations of length and width that have th e required sur-
face area will also work as long as the hydraulics condition s are met. Also
remember that inlet (2 m in length) and outlet zones (1 m) will a dd to the over-
all length of the VSB. Thus the total length of  a VSB system will also be 38 m.
In summary, to treat the 380 m3/d (0.1 MGD) of wastewater flow and to
meet the 30-30 standards, a VSB constructed wetland system that consists
four trains is designed. Each train is 38 m wide and 38 m long (2, 10.5, 24.5,
and 1 m in length, respectively, for the inlet zone, zone 1, zone 2,  and outlet
zone). The depths and media sizes are close to the values recommended b y
the US EPA (2000), as shown in Fig. 6.65.
