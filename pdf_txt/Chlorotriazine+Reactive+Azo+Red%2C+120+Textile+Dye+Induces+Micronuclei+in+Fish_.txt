Abstract
The textile industries play a major role in the economy of India. In addition to this, they exert acute and/or chronic effects on environment 
by discharge of effluent in the environment. This study was designed to assess the cyto genotoxicity of Reactive Red 120 (RR120) on 
freshwater fish Catla catla , using DNA damage in gill cells and blood cells as sensitive biomarkers. For this, fingerlings were exposed 
to three sublethal concentrations of RR120 (0.35, 0.7, 3.5 mg L–1). Samples (gills and peripheral blood) were collected and analyzed 
at fixed intervals (10, 20 and 30 days) and were compared with those of the control. Some nuclear changes were observed, such as 
micronuclei (MN), nuclear buds (NB), fragmented-apoptotic (FA) and bi-nucleated (BN) cells in both peripheral blood cells and gill 
cells. All the abnormalities showed dose- and time-dependent increase and were higher in the gill cells. The results clearly revealed the 
most significant change for MN, followed by FA, BN and NB in both samples. Hence, RR120 has a potential to damage DNA in cells 
and exerts genotoxic impact on fish. These findings also suggest the possible toxicity of RR120 to humans by direct or indirect exposure.

Introduction
Increasing industrialization and urbanization lead to 
environmental pollution. The discharge of toxic effluents 
from various industries adversely affects the aquatic 
ecosystem (Puvaneswari et al. 2006). Approximately 
more than ten thousand synthetic dyes are available 
commercially. Among these, azo dyes are widely used in 
the textile industry because of their  good brightness, low 
cost, ease of application and a wide range of colours (Padhi 
2012). Approximately up to 10 – 15% of dyes are discharged 
out in the form of effluents during the dyeing process. Very 
low concentration of azo dye (even less than 1 mg L–1) can 
be highly visible in water and interfere with penetration of 
light and affect aquatic flora and fauna (Patial, Kaur 2013). 
Most of the azo dyes are non-biodegradable, potentially 
toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic to living organisms, 
aquatic animals and humans (Rinde, Troll 1975; Ogugbue, 
Oranusi 2006; Padhi 2012). 
Fish have been considered as an efficient and effective 
model to evaluate toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic 
potential of pollutants (Monteiro et al. 2010). Among the fish 
models used for toxicity screening of aquatic environment, 
the cyprinid Catla catla  was chosen for this study because 
of its common availability in India throughout the year, and 
its considerable economic importance as an edible species 
and since it has been proved to be a sensitive indicator 
of environmental stress (Tilak et al. 1981; Anbumani, Mohankumar 2011).
Micronucleus (MN) assay is one of the most sensitive 
and promising tests to check the water quality and to verify 
the genotoxic potential of pollutants when discharged in 
aquatic environment (Kuniyoshi, Braga 2014). This test has 
served as an index of cytogenetic damage over 30 years due 
to its sensitivity (Fenech et al. 2003). In the present study, 
micronuclei assay was used to assess the genotoxicity of 
commercial Reactive Red 120 dye in C. catla . There is not 
much data on the effect of commercial dyes on the genetic 
integrity of aquatic organisms like fish. In addition to MN, 
which indicates unrepairable DNA damage, some other 
nuclear changes like nuclear bud (NB), bi-lobed nuclei 
(BN), fragmented apoptotic cells (FA) are also considered 
as sensitive indicators to assess cytogenotoxic impacts of 
toxins (Sreedevi, Chitra 2014). 
Previous studies show a good record on genotoxic 
effects of various contaminants on different species of fish 
(Deepa et al. 2011; Kousar, Javed 2015; Javed et al. 2016). 
Very few studies are available on azo dye toxicity on MN 
induction. Some results have reported earlier on effects of 
synthetic dye C.I. Acid violet 66 and C.I. acid red 217 dye on 
Oncorhynchus mykiss  (Marlsca et al. 1992). Similar results 
are reported on Prussian carp exposed to chlorotriazine 
reactive azo red 120 dye (Al-sabti 2000). Cytogenotoxicity 
of azo dye acid blue-113 to Channa punctatus  has been also 
reported recently (Kirandeep et al. 2015). It was recently 
reported that different concentrations of RR 120 induced

(Jagruti 2015).
The present study was aimed to determine genotoxic 
impact of three sub-lethal doses of azo dye RR 120 using 
micronuclei (MN) and other nuclear alterations like NB, 
BN and FA, in two different target tissues (peripheral 
blood cells and gill cells), in a tissue-specific dose and time 
dependent study on Catla catla  as a test model. 
Materials and methods
Test species and husbandry
Catla catla  fingerlings of 12 ± 2 cm length and weight 22 ± 
5 g were obtained from a fish seed farm at Sivan, Gujarat, 
India. They were first disinfected with 0.1% KMnO4 and 
acclimatized in laboratory conditions for two weeks. During 
acclimatization, fish were kept in continuous aerated 
chlorine-free tap water in aquarium (150 L). They were fed 
daily with commercially available trout food at 5% of their 
body weight. Fingerlings were not fed for 24 h prior to the 
experiment. Water quality was measured and maintained 
during acclimatization and throughout the experimental 
period as described in APHA (American Public Health et 
al. 2005). Some physicochemical parameters of the water 
were as follows: temperature, 25 ± 2 °C; pH 7.4; hardness 
120 mg L–1 (as CaCO3); alkalinity 125 mg L–1 (as CaCO3); 
and dissolved oxygen concentration 6.2 to 6.8 mg L–1.
Test chemical
The azo dye used in the present study is C.I. Reactive Red 
120 (RR120) [C44H24Cl2N14Na6O20S6] was obtained from a 
local source and used directly for experimental purpose. 
A stock solution was prepared by dissolving accurately 
weighed dye in distilled water to the concentration of 50 mg 
mL–1. It was stored it at 4 °C temperature. The experimental 
concentrations were obtained by diluting the stock solution 
in accurate proportions with dechlorinated water.   
Experimental design
Based on LC50 value (35 mg L–1), three sublethal 
concentrations (0.35, 0.7, 3.5 mg L–1) were selected for 
the exposure (Finney 1971). Healthy 70 acclimatized 
fingerlings were divided into seven groups (10 in each) and 
exposed to above mentioned sublethal concentrations of 
RR120 for 30 days. One group ( n = 10) was exposed to dye 
free dechlorinated tap water as a control. Peripheral blood 
and gill samples were collected three times on the same day 
at fixed intervals (10, 20 and 30 days) from the day of each 
exposure and analyzed for MN.  
Micronucleus test
The MN test was performed according to standard 
protocol (Al-Sabti, Metcalfe 1995). In brief, after exposure 
at fixed interval, peripheral blood samples were collected 
directly from caudal vein of each fingerling (exposed and control) in triplicate. Smears were prepared, air dried, fixed 
in methanol for 5 min and stained for 10 min with 10% 
Giemsa. Stained slides were then air dried and examined 
using light microscope under 100X. Microphotographs 
were taken and documentation was done for micronuclei.
Gills were dissected from control fish as well as exposed 
fingerlings in triplicate at 10, 20 and 30 days after exposure. 
Micronuclei smears were prepared following the standard 
air-drying Giemsa staining technique (Yunis, Barr 1966). In 
brief, gills were cut into small pieces and homogenized in 
0.56% hypotonic KCl solution and kept as such for 20 to 25 
min. These homogeneous mixtures were then centrifuged at 
1000 to 1500 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were discarded 
and the pellets were fixed in child Carnoy’s fixative. Three 
to four changes of fixative were given but the last change 
was in a small amount of fixative. This suspension was 
dropped on clean dry slides and air dried. Air dried smears 
were stained in 10% Giemsa solution for 10 to 20 min. 
Stained slides were then air dried and examined using a 
light microscope under 100 ×. Microphotographs were 
taken and documentation was done for micronuclei.
For the scoring of micronuclei, adopted criteria were 
as follows: MN should be separated from or marginally 
overlap with the main nucleus as long as there is a clear 
identification of the nuclear boundary. Micronuclei should 
have similar staining as the main nucleus. Micronuclei 
should be on same plane of focus as the main nuclei (Fenech 
et al. 2003). The frequency of micronuclei in each tissue 
was established by counting the number of micronuclei 
in at least 1000 cells per slide under 100 ×. Frequency of 
micronuclei was calculated by using the following formulae:  
Micronucleus frequency  (%) = Number of cells with 
micronuclei  / Total number of cells counted  × 100.
Statistical analysis
Data from the micronucleus test were expressed as 
mean±SD. Statistical analyses were calculated in triplicate 
performed using the computer software ‘SPSS’ . p < 0.05 
was considered to be the level of significance. Statistical 
significance in the frequencies of micronuclei and nuclear 
alterations between exposed and control groups after each 
dose and duration of exposure were evaluated.
Results
The sublethal concentrations of RR120 used in the present 
study induced a significantly higher number of MN and NAs 
in both peripheral blood and gills compared to the control 
(Fig. 1 to 4). The frequency of MN and NAs in all the dye-
treated groups was significantly different from control ( p < 
0.05). Frequency histograms of the damage grade in control 
and dye-treated group are shown in Fig. 1 and 3. Further, 
the induction of MN and NAs increased significantly with 
higher dye concentration and time of exposure. Fig. 1 shows 
the graphical representation of frequency of MN and NAs A. Parmar, A. Shah
152induction in peripheral erythrocytes of dye exposed C. 
catla (Fig. 2). The frequency of MN and NAs increased over 
time in all concentrations (10 < 20 < 30 days) for gills (Fig. 
3). Similarly sublethal concentrations led to greater effect 
(0.35 < 0.7 < 3.5 mg L–1). In lower concentrations MN and 
NAs had lower frequency. The maximum MN frequency 
was recorded at 3.5 mg L–1 concentration of RR120 at 30 
days after exposure. MN and NAs frequency increased in a 
dose- and time-dependent manner.
The frequencies of MN, FA, BN and NB were also 
significantly higher in all experimental groups when 
compared to the control one (Fig. 2, Fig. 4). However, effect 
on MN was more significant in all concentrations at all 
time intervals, than for FA, BN, and NB in both samples 
(Fig. 1, Fig. 3). 
Sub-lethal concentrations of RR120 evidently increased 
the micronuclei frequencies in both tissues in a dose- 
and time-dependent manner, compared to the respective 
controls. Fig. 3 presents the frequency of MN and NAs (FA, 
BN, NB) in gill tissue after exposure to RR120. There was 
remarkable and gradual increase in all markers including 
MN, FA, BN, and NB frequency in gill cells of dye exposed 
fingerlings (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). 
A comparison between the micronucleus frequency in 
both tissues revealed higher micronuclei frequencies in gill 
cells than in erythrocytes cells. The observation that RR120 
caused a greater increase in micronuclei frequency in cells 
of gills may be due to direct contact of gills with the test 
chemical in solution and therefore, higher exposure to the 
in situ  concentration of the compound.
The present study found that RR120 induced the micronuclei formation in C. catla . The results revealed that 
commercially available reactive red dye is genotoxic to fish 
at all doses tested in a dose-dependent manner.
Discussion
An attempt was made to assess the time- and dose-
dependence of tissue specific genotoxic effect of RR120 
azo dye in C. catla  fingerlings. When fish were exposed to 
higher concentrations of pollutants, nuclear and cellular

153abnormalities were observed in all the tissues. MN is the 
result of chromosome breaks (or mitotic anomalies), which 
are normally extruded along the main nucleus and their 
presence suggests their origin at a more recent cell cycle 
(Chandra, Khuda-Bukhsh 2004). Genotoxicity bioassay 
using micronuclei induction therefore helps to evaluate 
toxicity of minute quantities of pollutants especially in  
situations when there is no mortality. In the present study 
the selected anomalies (MN and NAs) were at higher 
frequency in gill cells as compared to peripheral blood. 
Gills are the first target organ that comes direct in contact with the contaminants, compared to other tissues of the 
body. Therefore, gills exhibit extreme cellular, biochemical 
and histopathological changes as compared to other organs 
of the body (Shimizu et al. 2007).
A dose dependent significant increase in MN clearly 
hints towards a clastogenic nature of the dye, as MN are 
believed to be derived from chromosome fragments. 
Induction of MN actually represents un-repairable and 
higher damage to DNA (Shimizu et al. 2007).
Only a few studies have been published on the effect of 
some textile dyes inducing micronuclei in fish erythrocytes. 
Our findings were supported by some recent and previous 
studies. Rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) exposed to 
Acid violet 66 and Acid Red 217 exhibited a significant 
increase in erythrocyte MNs following 30 days of exposure 
(Marlasca et al. 1992; Marlasca et al. 1998). Cytogenotoxicity 
of Acid Blue-113, azo dye was also concentration dependent 
and caused increased MN frequency along with NAs in 
all studied target tissues of Channa punctatus  (Kirandeep 
et al. 2015). Al-Sabti used micronucleus induction in fish 
erythrocytes to study the genotoxicity of chlorotriazine 
Reactive Azo Red 120 textile dye in aquatic ecosystems (Al-
Sabti 2000). Determination of genotoxic effect of azo dye 
C.I. RR 120 on fish C. catla  to studied by Avni and Jagruti 
(2016). Similar study was carried out on fish Oreochromis 
niloticus  (Cavas, Ergene-Gozukara  2003).
The present study indicated that the commercially 
available Reactive Red 120 dye is potentially genotoxic to 
fish. The study can be used as a baseline to assess its toxic 
effects at chromosomal and/or gene levels. The anonymity 
in the chemical structure, purity and other manufacturing 
processes makes these compounds difficult for evaluation. Fig. 3.  Comparison of the frequency of MN, NB, BN, and FA induction (±SD) in gill cells alteration in Catla catla  fingerling after three

significant ( p < 0.05) difference compared to control.

such ambiguous molecular toxicity can cause impact to 
aquatic system and hence invites attention.
