VOLUME 123 • NO 13Optimizing Inpatient 
Patient Experience 
Dear Editor: 
Quality of patient care, service, and com -
munication is critical for patient satisfaction�  
This is tied to several benefits for the health 
system, including increased patient compliance, 
loyalty, referral to new patients, and improved 
clinical productivity � The efficacy of a hospital 
is often dependent on the admitted patients’ 
experiences with different clinicians� These ex -
periences factor into the patients’ likelihood to 
refer the clinician to other potential patrons�  
Patients are likely to refer a clinician when they 
feel heard and included in the decision-making 
process� When patient satisfaction is low, it is 
reflected in the percentage of the “likelihood to 
refer �” A below-average score indicates a need 
to address departmental practices and poten -
tially change how clinicians interact with their 
patients� A cross-sectional study by Leow and 
Liew noted that the length of time a physician 
spends with their patient is one of the strongest 
determinants for patient satisfaction�1  
At Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 
the 9NT medicine floor continuously reported a 
likelihood to refer score between 50% and 67% 
from July 2022 through January 2023, with 76% 
being the desired goal� To improve likelihood to 
refer parameter, we started a project in February 
2023 focusing on improving clinicians’ scores 
by interventions to promote the communication 
between clinicians and their patients� We imple -
mented 3 focused intervention strategies to tar -
get patient satisfaction improvement� First, physi -
cians should press the “Provider in room” button 
on the Rauland’s panel upon entering a patient’s 
room, which alerts the bedside nurse to come into 
the room� The physician then discusses the plan 
of care (POC) with the patient and nurse, utilizing 
this time to address any questions or concerns 
intentionally focused on shared decision-making 
and collaboration� Next, the clinician should up -
date the whiteboard with the patient’s POC for the 
day and the expected discharge date and place � 
Then, at the end of the day, the physician will re-
connect with the patient either in person or via 
the patient’s in-room phone � During this time, the 
physician will share potential POC updates and 
ask if any changes occurred and if they can assist 
with anything before departing for the day �
 Prior to introduction of these interventions, 
“the likelihood to refer” percentage consistently 
remained below 67%� Within the first month of 
implementation of this pilot project, this rate in -
creased to 75%� Throughout the study span, the “likelihood to refer” for 9NT reached 78%, sur -
passing the desired target�
With 3 targeted intervention tactics, an in -
creased “likelihood to refer” percentage demon -
strates improved patient satisfaction� Based on 
the successful pilot project, we are implementing 
this on all medicine units at the hospital� This ini -
tiative will enhance the efficiency and productivity 
of the institution, improve patient retention, and 
foster trust between patients and their medical 
care team�

Comment on ‘Can 
Metronidazole Cause a 
Disulfiram-Like Reaction? 
A Case-Control Study 
Propensity Matched By 
Age, Sex and Ethanol 
Concentration’
Dear Editor,
We read with great interest the recently 
published article by Feldman and Jaszczenski 
regarding the possibility of a disulfiram-like reac -
tion brought about by the use of metronidazole �1 
According to their results, there were no patients 
who experienced such a reaction after concomitant 
use of alcohol and metronidazole � Based on this 
finding, they suggest that metronidazole should LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
not be avoided due to concern about an interaction 
with ethanol� Because of our continuous research 
on disulfiram, we find the issue very interesting and 
we would like to comment briefly on this report�
In a previous work of our laboratory team 
published in 2007, we clearly showed that met -
ronidazole does not provoke a disulfiram-like 
reaction, because it does not inhibit the hepatic 
aldehyde dehydrogenase nor increase blood ac -
etaldehyde in the Wistar rat�2 In addition, in this 
study, we demonstrated for the first time that 
metronidazole produces a tremendous increase 
in the levels of brain serotonin, while the enhanc -
ing effects of ethanol on the central levels of se -
rotonin are well established�3 Likewise, we con -
cluded that the reaction to ethanol exhibited by 
metronidazole may be the result of an interaction 
in the context of a type of a serotonin syndrome 
(SS), as in the case of the concomitant administra -
tion of agents possessing serotonergic activity � In 
support of this notion, it has been demonstrated 
that the combination of ethanol with serotonergic 
agents may induce a SS�4
The clinical manifestations of SS are a triad 
of altered conscious state, autonomic dysfunc -
tion, and neuromuscular excitability � However, in 
a retrospective study by Radomski et al,5 it was 
shown that the clinical picture of SS may be highly 
variable, and, in fact, all the symptoms observed 
during a “disulfiram reaction” are included in the 
detailed list of symptoms provided by this study �
In conclusion, we suggest that the authors 
should be aware of the serotonergic properties 
of metronidazole and ethanol, the combination 
of which might lead, at least in theory, to a SS, 
with symptoms very similar to those of a disulfi -
ram-like reaction� Hence, we believe that they 
might reconsider their suggestion that patients 
under treatment with metronidazole can safely 
use alcohol due to lack of interaction between 
these two agents� Given the low incidence of SS, 
the fact that none of the 18 patients of the study 
who received metronidazole and ethanol had a 
suspected disulfiram-like reaction cannot rule out 
the possibility of alcohol intolerance produced by 
metronidazole �

Leprosy in the Upper 
Midwest: Vigilance 
Needed for Contacts
Dear Editor,
A case report by Bach et al has brought to at -
tention a case of leprosy in the upper Midwest�1 
Several critical points need emphasis for the man -
agement of the patient's contacts and to prevent 
future complications for the patient� Specifically, 
the possibility of administering a single dose of 
rifampicin2 or rifapentine3 to the patient’s con -
tacts should be explored, as the patient is clas -
sified with borderline lepromatous leprosy, which 
carries a higher risk of transmission due to high 
bacillary loads�
It is imperative to conduct physical examina -
tions of all the patient’s contacts and provide them 
with a single dose of rifampicin or rifapentine as 
a preventive measure � A contact is defined as an 
individual who has had significant, prolonged ex -
posure to a leprosy patient, such as living in close 
proximity for at least 20 hours per week over a 
3-month period annually � This would typically in -
clude family members, neighbors, friends, class -
mates, and coworkers�
The World Health Organization's single-dose rifampicin recommendations are based on age 
and weight� For individuals 15 years and older 
weighing around 60 kg, the prescribed dose is 
600 mg; for those aged 10-14 years, it is 450 mg; 
for those aged 6 to 9 years weighing 20 kg or 
more, it is 300 mg; and for children aged 2 years 
or older weighing less than 20 kg, the dose is cal -
culated at 10-15 mg/kg�
It should be further emphasized that this pa -
tient is at a significant risk of developing erythema 
nodosum leprosum, which is a type 2 reaction, 
due to the abundant presence of bacilli� It is rec -
ommended to manage such cases with steroids, 
especially considering the neural involvement, 
but it should be done cautiously due to the asso -
ciated decreased visual acuity and the increased 
risk that steroids present� If severe reactions with 
systemic involvement are not controlled by ste -
roids and methotrexate, thalidomide may be con -
sidered as an alternative treatment�4 The initial 
dose of thalidomide is 100 mg 3 times daily, with 
subsequent dose reduction as appropriate �
