ABSTRACT  
 
 Biodcolorization of crystal violet (C V) was investigated in aquatic system. C 
V decolorizing bacterium (desig nated isolate AT 17) was isolated from effluent sample 
using enrichment technique by clear zone formation. Based on morphological, 
physiological and 16S rDNA, this bacterium was identified as Pseudomonas 
geniculata . It was capable of using C V as a sole so urce of carbon. Nutrient agar 
medium inhibited C V decolorization but mineral salt medium (MSM) increased C V 
decolorization. C V  decolorizing by  P. geniculata  was found to be optimum at pH 7 
and 35°C. Additional carbon sources (i.e., glucose) and nitrogen  sources (i.e., 
peptone, yeast extract and beef extract) inhibited completely C V decolorization. On 
the ather hand, ammonium chloride and ammonium sulphate increased the C V 
decolorization. Ammonium chloride was the best inorganic nitrogen source in C V 
decolorization.  Incubation period for 7 days was the optimum for C V decolorization.  
P. geniculata  was able to decolorize 99% of C V completely in liquid medium at pH 7 
and 35 °C  after 7 days comparing with uninoculated medium(control). There was no 
toxicit y of detected C V after 7 days of incubation with P. geniculata  on Bacillus 
subtilis  as microbial bioassay test. The dissipation of C V was coinciding with 
increasing P. geniculata  biomass in C V contaminated water. This study has shown 
that P.geniculata C V could be applied to remediate Chemical pollutants - 
contaminated water.

INTRODUCTION  
 
 Crystal violet falls in the class of triphenylmethane dyes which are 
commonly used in the clothing industr y to dye wool, silk and cotton (Kim et 
al., 2005). It is well known as a biological stain, yet also possesses medicinal 
properties. It has been used in the treatment of pinworms and as a topical 
agent as well as being added to feed to prevent fungal growth  (Azmi et al., 
1998). The toxicity of effluent is because of the presence of dye or its 
degraded products which are mutagenic or  carcinogenic. Therefore, the 
treatment of industrial effluents contaminated with dye becomes necessary 
prior to  their final dis charge to the environment. Various kinds of physico -
chemical methods are in use for the treatment  of wastewater contaminated 
with dye. These methods are not environment friendly and cost -effective and 
hence  become commercially unattractive (Nigam et al., 1996 and Azmi et al., 
1998).  Hauka, F. I.  et al.  
 166 Therefore, the purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize of 
the Crystal violet  decolorizing microbial strain and its use in bioremediation of 
Crystal violet  - contaminated water.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Chemicals:  
C V was donated by Agric. Microbiol. branch, Agric. Botany Dep., Fac. 
of Agric., Kafrelsheikh Univ., Egypt.  
Microbial decolorization of the crystal violet:  
Sampling and analysis of the effluent  
The effluent samples (the sludge and the wastewater ) were coll ected 
from the Station Exchange Aldoakhlah and Nasr Company for Textile orchard 
each of these areas Almehalla Alkobra.  The samples were transported to the 
laboratory at 4°C. Minimal Medium as mineral salt medium (MSM) and 
Nutrient agar medium were used thr ough this study as described by (Brunner 
et al., 1980).  
Isolation, screening and identification of dye decolorizing 
microorganisms from effluent.  
Crystal violet  decolorizing bacterium was isolated from effluent sample 
using enrichment technique use 100 ml  sterilized mineral salt liquid medium 
(MSL) in 500 ml glass bottle containing 50 mg /L from C V as a sole source of 
carbon. Dilution series were prepared after the final time from enrichment 
culture in a glass test tube containing 9 ml MSL liquid medium u p to 1:10-6 
and then 100 μl of the third enrichment culture was transferred onto MSA 
plates containing crystal violet (50 mg/L) and spread evenly with sterilized 
glass beads and were incubated at 28◦C for 7days monitored for appearance 
of colonies by clear  zone formation.  (Belal, and El -Nady, 2013 and Shah et 
al., 2013)  
Screening for  Crystal violet  decolorizing isolates by applying the clear 
zone test method.  
Mineral salt agar medium  (MSA) plates containing C V (50 mg /L) were 
inoculated with a loop full of  bacterial culture  from cultures of the strains. The 
increase in clear zone diameters developing on the MSA plates was followed 
up periodical (3 day and 7 day) and measured by slide gauge. Experiments 
were made in tri -plicates.  At least three replicates ex periments were 
performed with the unspotted plate as a control .  
Identification:  
The efficient selected  Crystal violet  (C V) degrading bacterial isolate 
was identified depending upon morphological and physiological 
characteristics as described by John (19 84) and Bergy,s manual of 
systematic bacteriology. (1984) as well as 16S rDNA  (Boye  et al., 1999).  This 
technique was performed by sigma, Cairo, Egypt and GATC Company .

1-Media  
MSA and NA were  containing C V (50 mg /L) were inoculated a loop 
full of cultures from the strain and incubated at 28°C for 7days.  J.Agric.Chem.and Biotechn., Mansoura Univ.Vo l. 5 (5): MAy, 2014

2-pH 
The pH of the inoculated MSA was adjusted to ( 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9) . The 
effect of pH on dye decolorization was checked after 7 days.  
3-Temperature  
The inoculated MSA was incubated at various temperatures (20, 30, 35 and 
40°C). The effect of temperature on dye decolorization was checked after 7 
days.  
4-Nitrogen sources  
To study the effect of nitrogen sources on decolorization of C V, MSA 
with concentrations of nitrogen such as (NH 4)2SO 4, (NH 4Cl) (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 
2%) and peptone(5g/L), Beef extract(3 g/L) as well as yeast extract(1g/L) at 
pH 7 and 35ºC.  
5-Incubation Time  
To determine the effect  of incubation period, at the optimum culture 
conditions (pH 7 and 35 ºC) for different incubation period (3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 
days).  
Decolorization of Crystal violet (C V) in MSL by P. geniculata strain AT 
17 
The bacterial cell suspension (107cfu/ml) was th en used to inoculate 
100 ml MSL containing (50 mg/L) of the dye. The cultures were incubated at 
35 °C, pH 7 and 150 rpm for 7 days. The test principle is based on the 
decrease of the optical density of the dye during the dyes decolorization. The 
percentage  of decolorization of the dye was determined photometrically using 
UV–vis pectrophotometer at OD 590nm for C V. Control flasks of equal volume 
of MSL and dye without any microbial inoculation were incubated in parallel 
at all intervals to assess abiotic los s. During the experiment, samples were 
collected (1 ml) periodically at 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 day for estimation of viable cell 
count (cfu/ml) by using dilution series onto MSA containing of the dye and to 
determine the decolorization using UV–vis pectrophotome ter. All the 
experiments were done in triplicates.  The percentage of decolorization was 
calculated as by ( Yatome et al., 1993).  
Toxicity test Crystal violet (C V) decolorizing products  
The bioassay of the remaining C V toxicity was performed on the 
aqueous  solutions after 7 days of incubation with P. geniculata  strain AT 17. 
Bacillus subtilis , as gram positive bacterium was used as the test organism. 
The toxicity was determined by recording of inhibition zone in growth of B. 
subtilis  comparing to control tr eatment (untreated). Plates were incubated at 
35 °C for 7 days.  
Statistical analysis  
Data were calculated as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed 
using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Probability of 0.05 or less was 
considered significant. The statis tical package Program was used for all 
chemometric calculations  (Parshetti  et al., 2011).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
The most widely used screening method for  Crystal violet  (C V) 
decolorizing organisms is the so called “clear zone” method. The extracellu lar 
hydrolyzing enzymes secreted by the target organism decolorize the 
suspended dye in the agar medium into water soluble products thereby 
producing zones of clearance around the colony. The main advantage of this 
test is that it is generally fast, cheap and simple, and allows the simultaneous 
performance of a great number of parallel tests (Belal, 2003).  
Isolation and screening of dye decolorizing microorganisms  
From the microbial sources ( textile effluent ) a total of 19 
morphologically  different C V de colorizing isolates were obtained.  
Among 19 bacterial isolates, One bacterial isolate designated as AT 17 
achieved higher C V decolorization (wider clear zone) comparing with the 
other isolates (Fig.1).  
The results were compared with those obtained with n oninoculated 
medium (controls).

Identification of the efficient of Crystal violet (C V) decolorizing isolate.  
This bacterial isolate (AT 17) was identified according to morphological, 
physiological as well as using analysis of 16S rDNA (Boye  et al., 1999).  This 
efficient C V decolorizing isolate (AT 17) was gram -negative, motile, short 
rods and oxidase positive. According to the 16S rDNA analysis, the 
phyloge netic tree of the C V decolorize bacterium isolate AT 17 and related 
bacterial species based on the 16S rDNA sequence is provided in Fig (2). It 
can be clearly seen that the Pseudomonas  sp AT 17. as C V decolorize 
bacterium was included in the genus Pseudo monas  and closely related to the J.Agric.Chem.and Biotechn., Mansoura Univ.Vo l. 5 (5): MAy, 2014

Effect of different Media on decolorization of Crystal violet (C V) by  P. 
geniculata  AT 17  
MSA and Nutrient agar containing C V (50 mg/L) media were used to 
know the effect of the media on C V decolorization by clear zone formation. 
P. geniculata  strain AT 17 formed only clear zone on MSA but it was 
observed that no clear zone was formed on nutri ent agar medium containing 
C V and this may be due to  presence of nutrient components in nutrient agar 
medium suppressed C V decolorization enzymes which could be decolorize 
C V.  
The results were compared with those obtained with noninoculated 
medium (con trol) incubated in the respective media. The noninoculated 
control showed no clear zone.  MSA was selected for the further experiments.

 170 Effect of different pH on decolorization of Crystal violet (C V) by  P. 
geniculata AT 17  
The influence of pH on decolori zation of C V in MSA with P. geniculata 
strain AT 17  by using clear zone formation is shown in Table (1).  The highest 
C V decolorization with strain was achieved at pH 7 with wider clear zone 
formation followed by PH 8  C V was not decolorized by strain at pH4 and 5 
(acidic pH) as well as at pH9 (alkali pH).  This results are in agreement with  
Adedayo et al. (2004) who showed that  Klebsiella pneumonia  RS-13, which  
completely degraded Methyl Red in the pH range of 6 –8.

Effect of different Temperature on decolorization of Crystal violet (C V) 
by P. geniculata strain AT 17  
 The effect of different temperatures on decolorization of C V is shown 
in Table (2). while the highest decolorization was achieved at 35 °C, (wider 
clear zone). The dye decolorization activity of the strain was found to 
decrease with increasing incubation temperature over 35°C. and least 
decolorization at 30, respect ively. This can be explained that temperature can 
influence enzyme conformations which in turn effects catalytic activity (Staub 
and Denes, 1969).

sulphate and ammo nium chloride) and components of nutrient medium 
(organic nitrogen) (peptone 5gm/L, beef extract 3gm/L and yeast extract 
1gm/L) is shown in Table (3). Mineral nitrogen sources (such as 1% 
ammonium sulphate and ammonium chloride)  were the best in C V 
decolo rization (clear zone formation) by P. geniculata  strain AT 17 . 
Decolorization was achieved with ammonium chloride  more than ammonium 
sulphate . Components of nutrient broth medium suppressed the 
decolorization of C V by  P. geniculata  strain AT 17.                        Temperature

Effect of different concentrations from ammonium sulphate and 
ammonium chloride on decolorization of Crystal violet (C V) by  P. 
geniculata  strain AT 17  
Crystal violet (C V) decolorization by P. geniculata  strain AT 17 when 
grown on different concentrations (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2%) of the best N source 
(ammonium sulphate and ammonium chloride) in presence of the best carbon 
source (C V) are presented in Tables (4). It was revealed that ammonium 
chloride at 1.5% was the optimum level for P. geniculata AT 17. Parshetti et 
al. (2011) who showed that Crystal Violet decolorization of 100% was  
observed with 0.1% NH4Cl within 5 hr . 
 Nigam et al. (1996 ) reported on how the highest decolorization was 
addition of inorganic nitrogen source (ammonium chloride or ammonium 
sulphate) but it decreased or inhibited completely addition organic nitrogen 
source (peptone or yeast extract). With fungal studi es concerning dye 
degradation, additional nitrogen sources can either have a positive or 
adverse effect on decolorization. They proposed that nitrogen suppressed the 
enzymatic system and found that a nitrogen limiting environment stimulates 
enzyme producti on. Although it's clear that additional nitrogen reduces or 
inhibits decolorization.

C V decolorization (clear zone formation) increase with time dependent 
manner and highest C V decolorization was obtained after 7 days for growth 
of P. geniculata strain AT 17. The C  V decolorization was similar at 7, 9 and 
11 days after incubation time, respectively.  Incubation period on 
decolorization of Crystal violet by Pseudomonas putida  is 7 days (Chen et 
al., 2007).

Effect of  decolorization of Crystal violet (C V)  in MSL by P. geniculata 
strain AT 17 in aquatic system.  
 Additionally to the qualitative clear -zone tests, the degradation 
potential of P. geniculata strain  AT 17  was characterized via percentage of 
decolorization de termination of dyes in MSL. The decolorization potential 
obtained for C V which obtained it with P. geniculata strain  AT 17  at 35°C 
pH7 after 7 days. The results in Table (6) summarize the differences of 
decolorization for C V by P. geniculata strain  AT 17  in aquatic system . In the 
present study, dyes decolorization was increased with increasing the 
incubation period in the medium amended with P. geniculata strain AT 17  in 
all cases.  The application of C V decolorizing strain increased the number of 
cultiva ble C V - decolorizing cells in the the aquatic system during the 7 days 
of incubation  (Table 6). The experimental results were compared with the 
noninoculated (control), which showed less decolorization of the dye due to a 
biotic stress .

Chengalroyen (2011)  found that, Bacterial strain Amycolatopsis orientalis  
SY6 was able to decolorize amido black, janus gre en and several 
triphenylmethane dyes effectively. This suggests that the same enzyme/s 
might be involved in the reduction of all these dyes.  In general, it was noticed 
that bacteria capable of degrading C V were also able to mineralize other 
triphenylmetha ne dyes such as malachite green, brilliant green and basic 
fuchsin. This allows for the speculation that either the enzymes responsible 
for triphenylmethane class degradation are more lenient in their substrate                 Treatments

 173 interactions or the dye structural difference s are minor and  hence easier to 
accommodate. Additionally, research done on P. pseudomallei  found that 
decolorization of triphenylmethane dyes was not linked to the molecular 
weight or permeability of the compound through the membrane (Azmi et al., 
1998 (.  
Toxicity evaluation:  
 Fig. (3). Show 99 % decolorizing of C V by P. geniculata  strain AT 17  
under the optimum conditions. Toxicity of the remaining C V in the aqueous 
solution after 7 days  of incubation  with the tested microbial strain was 
evaluated using  B. subtilis  as a microbial bioassay test.  P. geniculata strain 
AT 17  exhibited the highest decolorization for CV. The results showed that 
the supernatant of C V after 7 days of incubation with P. geniculata AT 17  
had no toxicity which could be detected ag ainst B. subtilis  as a test organism. 
The obtained results were compared with control treatment (C V only) which 
revealed 100% of inhibition against B. subtilis  under the same conditions (Fig. 
4). This implies that the aqueous solution spiked with C V was completely 
detoxified after 7 days of treatment with P. geniculata strain AT 17 . It has 
been reported that these dyes inhibit cell growth by interfering with nucleic 
acid synthesis thus decreasing protein synthesis (Azmi et al., 1998). Yatome 
et al. (1993)  were the first to elucidate the degradation of C V by Nocardia  
spp.

 تم دراسة عملٌة إزالة اللون لصبغة الكرٌستال البنفسجً الملوثة للماء من مصادر مختلفة مثل 
مصانع النسٌج بواسطة البكتٌرٌا حٌث أنه تم عزل ب كتٌرٌا مزٌلة للون صبغة الكرٌستال البنفسجً (رقم 
كودي ِ AT 17  .)) بطرٌقة االمداد الغذائً من عٌنة مٌاه صرف باستخدام الهالة الشفافة (منطقة التحلل الشفافة
وتم تعرٌف البكتٌرٌا إعتماداَ على الصفات المورفولوجٌة والكٌموحٌوٌة والوراثٌة باستخدام 16S rDNA  على
أنها بسٌدو موناس جٌنكٌوالتا Pseudomonas geniculata  . وتستطٌع هذه الساللة استخدام صبغة 
الكرٌستال البنفسجً كمصدر للكربون . ولدراسة أفضل الظروف لعملٌة إزاله اللون بواسطة هذه الساللة وجد 
أن أفضل بٌئة هً البٌئة المعدنٌة إلزالة الكرٌستال البنفسجً بعكس بٌئة األجار المغذي التً منعت إزالة اللون  
تماما , كما وجد أن رقم الحموضة 7  ودرجة حرارة55°  .م هى األفضل لنشاط المٌكروب فى عملٌة اإلزالة
كما ثبط الجلوكوز أٌضا كمصدر للكربون والبٌبتون ومستخلص الخمٌرة ومستخلص اللحم كمصدر للنٌتروجٌن 
العضوي لعملٌة إزالة لون الكرٌستال البنفسجً تثبٌطا كامال ولكن وجد من ناحٌة أخرى أن كل من كبرٌتات 
األمونٌوم وكلورٌد األمونٌوم زادت من عملٌة إزالة لون الكرٌستال البنفسجً كلورٌد األمونٌوم كان أفضل  
مصدر نٌتروجٌن غٌر عضوى فى ازالة اللون لصبغة الكرستال البنفسجى. 
 كما اتضح أٌضا أن افضل فترة تحضٌن لعملٌة اإلزالة اللونٌة لصبغة الكرستال البنفسجى هى 7 
 أٌام. أظهرت النتائج أٌضا أنه قد تم إزالة لون الكرٌستال البنفسجً بنسبة تصل إلى 99  %  ببكتٌرٌا 
بسٌدوموناس جٌنكٌوالتا Pseudomonas geniculata  فً البٌئة السائلة مقارنة بالبٌئة السائلة غٌر 
الملقحة والمستخدمة ككنترول. كما نالحظ عدم وجود سمٌة لصبغة الكرٌستال البنفسجً فً بٌئة األجار المغذى 
التً تم تحضٌنها مع بكتٌرٌا بسٌدوموناس جٌنكٌوالتا Pseudomonas geniculata  لمدة7  أٌام على
بكتٌرٌا باسٌلٌس سابتلٌس Bacillus subtilis .كمٌكروب مستخدم للتقٌٌم الحٌوي 
 وأوضحت النتائج أن إزالة اللون كان متوافقا مع زٌادة الكتلة الحٌوٌة لبكتٌرٌا بسٌدوموناس 
جٌنكٌوالتا Pseu domonas geniculate  .فً البٌئة السائلة 
 وتبٌن هذه الدراسة أن بكتٌرٌا بسٌدوموناس جٌنكٌوالتا P. geniculata  ٌمكن استخدامها تطبٌقٌا
للمعالجة البٌولوجٌة للملوثات الكٌماوٌة فى المٌاه.
