Biomimetic Approach to Cardiac Tissue Engineering

Doctor of Philosophy in Chemical Engineering
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the Western world. Tissue engineering may
offer alternative treatment options or suitable models for studies of normal and pathological
cardiac tissue function in vitro. Current tissue engineering approaches have been limited by
diffusional oxygen supply, lack of physical stimuli and absence of multiple cell types
characteristic of the native myocardium.
We hypothesized that functional, clinically sized (1-5 mm thick), compact cardiac
constructs with physiologic cell densities can be engineered in vitro by mimicking cell
microenvironment present in the native myocardium in vivo.
Since cardiac myocytes have limited ability to proliferate we developed methods of
seeding cells at high densities while maintaining cell viability. Cultivation of cardiac constructs in
the presence of convective-diffusive oxygen transport in perfusion bioreactors, maintained
aerobic cell metabolism, viability and uniform distribution of cells expressing cardiac markers.
To improve cell morphology and tissue assembly cardiac constructs were cultivated with
electrical stimulation of contraction in a physiologically relevant regime. Electrical stimulation
enabled formation of tissue with elongated cells aligned in parallel and with organized
ultrastructure remarkably similar to the one present in the native heart. To investigate the effect of
multiple cell types on the properties of engineered cardiac tissue cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac
myocytes were cultivated synchronously, separately or serially (pretreatment of scaffolds with
fibroblasts followed by the addition of myocytes). Presence of fibroblasts remarkably improved
contractile response of the engineered cardiac constructs with the superior biochemical and
morphological properties in the pretreated group. Finally, in order to mimic capillary structure
cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes were co-cultured on a scaffold with a parallel channel array that
was perfused with culture medium supplemented with synthetic oxygen carrier (PFC emulsion).
Presence of the PFC emulsion resulted in significantly higher cell density and improved
contractile properties compared to the constructs cultivated in the culture medium alone, by
increasing total oxygen content and effective diffusivity.

1. INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the Western world. It kills more
people than next five leading causes of death including cancer. (AHA update 2004) Diseases
related to myocardium, heart muscle, contribute to a significant portion of this death toll. Nearly
8 million people in the United States alone have suffered from myocardial infraction, with
800,000 new cases occurring each year [I].
Conventional treatment options, including drugs and assist devices are limited by inability of
myocardium to regenerate after injury. Cell based therapies have been considered as a novel and
potentially curative treatment option [2], either by utilization of cells alone [3-15] or by
cultivation of cardiac construct in vitro that can be surgically attached to the myocardium [16-30].
While cell injection can be pursued as a treatment option for small scale injuries, improved cell
localization achieved by tissue engineering can potentially be utilized to repair large scale injuries
and congenital malformations. In addition, engineered cardiac tissue can be utilized as a model
system for study of normal and pathological cardiac function in vitro.
Most of the current tissue engineering approaches are limited by diffusional
supply of oxygen from the surface of the construct to the interior resulting in a non-
uniform cell distribution with the shell of functional tissue on the outside and an empty
interior. Construct cultivation in perfused cartridges markedly improved the uniformity
of cell distribution but the overall cell density remained low, due to the oxygen
diffusional limitations associated with cell seeding.
In standard culture systems (dishes, flasks, rotating vessels), cardiomyocytes did not align in
parallel as in the native heart and they remained poorly differentiated due to the lack of orderly
excitation-contraction coupling [17, 18]. Application of contraction alone via cyclic mechanical
stretch significantly improved the level of cell differentiation and force of contraction, but some
hallmarks of cardiac differentiation were still missing (M bands, IC discs) [29]. In addition, the
distribution and frequency of gap junctions, critical for electrical signal propagation in the tissue,
remained unclear. Notably, excitation-contraction coupling, which is crucial for the development
and function of native myocardium [31], has not been established in any of these culture systems.
The main objective of this thesis was to develop the tissue culture approach that would remedy
the problems associated with the conventional culture.
We hypothesized that functional, clinically sized (1-5 mm thick), compact cardiac constructs
with physiologic cell densities can be engineered in vitro by mimicking cell microenvironment
present in the native myocardium in vivo. The key parameters in the cell microenvironment
13
include: high cell density with multiple cell types, convective diffusive oxygen transport through
a capillary network and orderly excitation contraction coupling (Tablel.1) During the course of
this PhD thesis each of the factors present in the Table 1.1 was tested independently. The
obtained results are summarized in six manuscripts, whose abstracts are included as Chapters 3-
8.
Table 1.1 Factors governing cardiac tissue development in vitro and in vivo.
The organization of this thesis is as follows:
Chapter 2 described basicis of cardiac muscle structure and function and provides the
overview of tissue culture methods up to date.
Chapter 3 address oxygen diffusional limitations during seeding by providing a method that
enables uniform cell seeding at high initial densities (108cells/cm3) while maintaining viability.
Seeding of cardiomyocytes at high initial densities is essential for cultivation of dense compact tissue
since cardiomyocytes have limited ability to proliferate. The seeding method consists of two steps:
rapid inoculation of gel/cell suspension onto collagen sponges followed by the application of
alternating medium flow for convective oxygen supply.
Chapter 4 describes cultivation of cardiac constructs in the presence of convective-diffusive
oxygen transport in perfusion bioreactors. Medium perfusion maintained aerobic cell metabolism,
high viability and uniform distribution of cells expressing cardiac markers and superior contractile
properties compared to the dish grown controls.
Chapter 5 describes establishment of orderly excitation-contraction coupling of engineered
cardiac constructs during in vitro culture. Synchronous construct contractions were induced by
suprathreshold electrical field stimulation using a commercial cardiac stimulator. Electrical
stimulation enabled formation of tissue with elongated cells aligned in parallel and with organized
ultrastructure remarkably similar to the one present in the native heart.

Chapter 6 investigates the effect of multiple cell types on the properties of engineered cardiac
tissue. Cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes were cultivated synchronously, separately or serially
(pretreatment of scaffolds with fibroblasts followed by the addition of myocytes). Presence of
fibroblasts remarkably improved contractile response of the engineered cardiac constructs with the
superior biochemical and morphological properties in the pretreated group.
Chapter 7 describes co-culture of cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes on an elastic scaffold with
capillary-like channel array perfused with culture medium supplemented with synthetic oxygen
carrier (PFC emulsion). Presence of PFC emulsion resulted in significantly higher cell density and
improved contractile properties compared to the constructs cultivated in the culture medium alone,
presumably by increasing total oxygen content.
Chapter 8 describes a mathemactical model of oxygen distribution in the channeled cardiac
construct perfused with oxygen carrier supplemented culture medium. The release of oxygen from
PFC particles was estimated not to be rate limiting.
Chapter 9 summarizes the results of this thesis and identifies problems that need to be
addressed in the future work.

2. BACKGROUND'
Overview
A variety of exciting new strategies have emerged over the past decade to address the clinical
problem of tissue failure. Tissue engineering is particularly significant because it can provide
biological substitutes of compromised native tissues. As compared to the transplantation of cells
alone, engineered tissues have the potential advantage of immediate functionality. As compared to
transplantation of native tissues, engineered tissues can alleviate the scarcity of suitable tissue
transplants, as well as donor-recipient compatibility and disease transmission (for allografts), and
donor site morbidity (for autografts). Engineered tissues can also serve as physiologically
relevant models for controlled studies of cells and tissues under normal and pathological
conditions. Ideally, a lost or damaged tissue could be replaced by an engineered graft that can re-
establish appropriate structure, composition, cell signalling and function of the native tissue. In
light of this paradigm, the clinical utility of tissue engineering will likely depend on our ability to
replicate the site-specific properties of the particular tissue across different size scales. In
engineered constructs, the cells should conform to a specific differentiated phenotype, while the
composition and architectural organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) should provide the
necessary functional properties inherent to the tissue being replaced. Ideally, an engineered graft
should provide regeneration, rather than repair, and undergo remodelling in response to
environmental factors.
In general, the tissue engineering requirements can be summarized as follows. To begin with,
it is necessary to generate a graft of a desired size and shape to repair a specific defect. Next, the
grafts should have the biochemical composition, histomorphology and ultrastructure mimicking
those of the native tissue being replaced. Furthermore, it is often necessary for a graft to provide
immediate functionality at some minimal level. For load-bearing tissues for example, mechanical
competence of the engineered tissue can critically determine if the graft will survive implantation.
An engineered graft should also have the capacity to fully integrate (structurally and functionally)
with the adjacent host tissues. Additional requirements include specific structural and functional

properties such as compressive stiffness for cartilage, contractile function for myocardium, and
vascularization for most tissues.
Cells, biomaterial scaffolds, biochemical and physical regulatory signals have been utilized in
a variety of ways to engineer tissues, in vitro and in vivo. Tissue engineering generally involves
the presence of reparative cells, a structural template, facilitated transport of nutrients and
metabolites, and a provision of molecular and mechanical regulatory factors.
Tissue Engineering Model System
One envisioned scenario of clinically relevant tissue engineering involves the use of
autologous cells, a biodegradable scaffold (designed to serve as a structural and logistic template
for tissue development), and a bioreactor (designed to enable environmental control and support
cell differentiation and functional assembly into an engineered tissue) (Figure 2.1). Cells are
generally isolated from a small tissue sample, expanded in culture under conditions selected to
yield sufficient number for seeding a clinically sized scaffold and in some cases transfected to
(over)express a gene of interest. Scaffolds should be made of biocompatible materials,
preferentially those already approved for clinical use. Scaffold structure determines the transport
of nutrients, metabolites and regulatory molecules to and from the cells, whereas the scaffold
chemistry may have an important role in cell attachment and differentiation. The scaffold should
biodegrade at the same rate as the rate of tissue assembly and without toxic or inhibitory
products. Mechanical properties of the scaffold should ideally match those of the native tissue
being replaced, and the mechanical integrity should be maintained as long as necessary for the
new tissue to mature and integrate.
In this approach, a bioreactor should ideally provide all necessary conditions in in vitro
environment for rapid and orderly tissue development by cells cultured on a scaffold. In general,
a bioreactor is designed to perform one or more of the following functions: () establish a desired
spatially uniform cell concentration within the scaffold during cell seeding, (ii) maintain
controlled conditions in culture medium (e.g., temperature, pH, osmolality, levels of oxygen,
nutrients, metabolites, regulatory molecules), (iii) facilitate mass transfer, and (iv) provide
physiologically relevant physical signals (e.g., interstitial fluid flow, shear, pressure,
compression) during cultivation of cell-polymer constructs.

Figure 2.1. Tissue engineering based on cell cultivation on biomaterial scaffolds in
bioreactors. Cells (e.g., from cartilage, heart or bone marrow) are cultured on a
scaffold (e.g., highly porous, biodegradable mesh or a sponge) in a bioreactor (e.g.,
rotating bioreactor or perfused cartridge [1]). The resulting constructs are usedfor
controlled in vitro studies or implanted in vivo (e.g., to repair an osteochondral
defect [2] or injured myocardium [3]).
Three representative culture vessels that are frequently used for tissue engineering are
compared in Figure 2.2. All culture vessels are operated in an incubator (to maintain the
temperature and pH) with continuous gas exchange and periodic medium replacement.
Flasks contain constructs that are fixed in place by threading onto needles and cultured
either statically or with magnetic stirring, with gas exchange through loosened side arm caps.
Rotating vessels contain constructs that are freely suspended in culture medium between two
concentric cylinders the inner of which serves as a gas exchange membrane. The vessel rotation
rate is adjusted to maintain each construct settling at a stationary point within the vessel. This
experimental set-up thus enables the evaluation of the effects of flow and mass transfer on
engineered tissues and the selection of suitable culture environments to be further explored and
optimised.

Myocardium (cardiac muscle).
The myocardium (cardiac muscle) is a highly differentiated tissue composed of cardiac
myocytes and fibroblasts with a dense supporting vasculature and collagen-based extracellular
matrix. The myocytes form a three-dimensional syncytium that enables propagation of electrical
signals across specialized intracellular junctions to produce coordinated mechanical contractions
that pump blood forward. Only 20-40% of the cells in the heart are cardiac myocytes but they

occupy 80-90% of the heart volume. The average cell density in the native rat myocardium is on
the order of 5x108 cells/cm3.Morphologically, intact cardiac myocytes have an elongated, rod
shaped appearance. Contractile apparatus of cardiac myocytes consists of sarcomeres arranged in
parallel myofibrils. High metabolic activity is supported by the high density of mitochondria and
electrical signal propagation is provided by specialized intercellular connections, gap junctions
[9, 10].
The control of heart contractions is almost entirely self-contained. Groups of specialized
cardiac myocytes (pace makers), fastest of which are located in the sinoatrial node, drive periodic
contractions of the heart. Majority of the cells in the myocardium are non-pace maker cells and
they respond to the electrical stimuli generated by pace maker cells. Excitation of each cardiac
myocyte is followed by the increase in the amount of cytoplasmic calcium which triggers
mechanical contraction. The propagation of the electrical excitation through the tissue by ion
currents in the extracellular and in the intercellular space results in synchronous contraction, that
enables expulsion of the blood from the heart.
Clinical need
Cardiovascular disease is responsible for a preponderance of health problems in the developed
countries, as well as in many developing countries. Heart disease and stroke, the principal
components of cardiovascular disease, are the first and the third leading cause of death in the
U.S., accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths. Congenital heart defects, which occur in nearly 14
of every 1000 newborn children [11] year of life [12]. Cardiovascular diseases result in
substantial disability and loss of productivity, and largely contribute to the escalating costs of
health care. About 61 million Americans (almost one-fourth of the population) live with
cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, congenital cardiovascular defects, and
congestive heart failure, and 298.2 billion dollars were spent in 2001 to treat these diseases [13].
The economic impact of cardiovascular disease on the U.S. health care system is expected to
grow further as the population ages.
Once damaged, the heart is unable to regenerate. Heart failure affects over five million
Americans [14], and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries [15].
Currently, the only definitive treatment for end stage heart failure is cardiac transplantation.
However, the limited availability of organs for transplantation has led to prolonged waiting
periods that are often not survivable [16]. Repair of myocardial injuries has been attempted by
injection of myogenic cells into scarred myocardium [17] and the replacement of scarred tissue
with engineered grafts [18].
21
Tissue engineering of myocardium
Tissue engineering has emerged over the last decade as an interdisciplinary field with
tremendous potential. Tissue engineering offers a possibility of creating tissue constructs to be
used for repair of larger injuries or congenital malformations. In addition cardiac tissue constructs
may be utilized for studies of normal and pathological tissue function in vitro. Substantial
progress has been made in areas of biopolymers [19], cell-material interactions [20] and bio-
mimetic culture devices [21]. In addition, functional tissues have been developed and implanted
in vivo, including (but not limited to) cartilage [22], bone [23], bladder [24] and blood vessels
[25,Niklason, 1999 #343]. However, fundamental and all-encompassing problems remain. One of
the most important ones is mass transfer into the tissues that are greater than 100-200 m in
thickness, both during the in vitro cultivation and following implantation in vivo. This explains
why tissue engineering has been most successful with tissues that are either thin (e.g., bladder) or
have low oxygen requirements (e.g., cartilage). There are multiple challenges to be overcome to
produce viable, functional cardiac tissue (Table 2.1 ).
Table 2.1 Key challenges of cardiac tissue engineering
In current approaches, fetal or neonatal rat cardiomyocytes are seeded onto scaffolds
(collagen sponges, polyglycolic acid meshes) or cast in collagen gels, and cultivated immersed in
the culture medium in static or mixed dishes, spinner flasks or rotating vessels [26, 27]. The
metabolism and viability of the resulting constructs are assessed during culture by monitoring
levels of glucose consumed, lactate produced and the release of lactate dehydrogenase from the
samples of culture medium. Cell distribution, morphology and construct structure are assed by
histology. Expression of cardiac specific markers is assessed by immunohistochemistry and
confirmed by Western blots. Gene expression is assessed by RT-PCR. Cardiac specific
ultrastructural features are detected by transmission electron microscopy. Functional assessment
22* Development of appropriate biodegradable and biocompatible scaffolds that
can provide adequate mass transfer, vascularization, and transduction of mechanical and
electrical signals
* Development of bio-mimetic culture systems that promote differentiated
function and excitation -contraction coupling of cardiac cells
* Development of functional vascular networks embedded into the cardiac
muscle tissue to promote nutrient and oxygen transfer, angiogenesis and integration with
the host vasculature.
of engineered constructs has been based on electrophysiological studies [28, 29], monitoring of
synchronous contractions in response to electrical stimuli [30, 31] and measurement of force of
contraction in paced [32] or spontaneously contracting constructs [33].
Cells. Three dimensional cardiac tissue constructs were successfully cultivated in dishes using
variety of scaffolds and cell sources. Fetal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes were expanded after
isolation, inoculated into collagen sponges and cultivated in static dishes for up to 4 weeks [3].
The cells proliferated with time in culture and expressed multiple sarcomeres. Adult human
ventricular cells were used in a similar system, although they exhibited no proliferation [34].
Fetal cardiac cells were also cultivated on alginate scaffolds in static 96-well plates. After 4 days
in culture the cells formed spontaneously beating aggregates in the scaffold pores [35]. Cell
seeding densities of the order of 108cells/cm3were achieved in the alginate scaffolds using
centrifugal forces during seeding [36]. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes formed spontaneously
contracting constructs when inoculated in collagen sponges within 36 hr [33] and maintained
their activity for up to 12 weeks. The contractile force increased upon addition of Ca2+and
epinephrine.
Two-week constructs based on neonatal rat cardomyocytes exhibited spontaneously beating
areas, whereas constructs based on embryonic chick myocytes exhibited no contractions and
reduced in size by 60%. Immunohistochemistry, revealed presence of large number of non-
myocytes in the constructs based on embryonic chick hear cells, while constructs based on
neonatal rat cells consisted mostly of elongated cardiomyocytes [26].
Constructs based on the cardiomyocytes enriched by preplating exhibited lower excitation
threshold (ET), higher conduction velocity, higher maximum capture rate (MCR), and higher
maximum and average amplitude [37].
Scaffolds. The scaffolds utilized for cardiac tissue engineering include collagen fibers [38],
collagen sponges [3, 33, 34] and polyglycolic acid meshes [26, 27, 37]. The main advantage of a
synthetic scaffold such as PGA is that it provides mechanical stability, while scaffolds based on
natural cell polymers such as collagen enable rapid cell attachment.
The scaffold free approaches include casting the cells in collagen gels followed by mechanical
stimulation [39-41] and stacking of confluent cardiac cell monolayers [42]. The main advantage
of scaffold free approaches is higher active force generated by such tissues. However, the main
disadvantage remains tailoring the shape and dimensions of the scaffold free engineered tissues.
23
As an alternative, gels (Matrigel) were combined with scaffolds (collagen sponge) to achieve
rapid cell inoculation and attachment along with the possibility of tailoring tissue shape and
dimensions through the use of scaffolds [30].
Bioreactor hydrodynamics. The representative bioreactors utilized for tissue engineering of the
myocardium include static or mixed dishes, static or mixed flasks and rotating vessels (Figure 2.1
and 2.2). These bioreactors offer three distinct flow conditions (static, turbulent, and laminar)
and therefore differ significantly in the rate of oxygen supply to the surface of the tissue
construct. Oxygen transport is a key factor for myocardial tissue engineering due to the high cell
density, very limited cell proliferation and low tolerance of cardiac myocytes for hypoxia In all
configurations oxygen is supplied only by diffusion from the surface to the interior of the tissue
construct.
Static dishes remain the most widely used set-up for cardiac tissue engineering (Table 2.2). In
static dishes, oxygen and nutrients are supplied mainly by diffusion, which is capable of
satisfying oxygen demand of only -100 gm thick surface layer of compact tissue, whereas the
construct interior remained mostly acellular [43]. In contrast, cartilage has been successfully
grown in static dishes to millimeter thicknesses. In orbitally mixed dishes, the rate of delivery of
oxygen and nutrients to construct surfaces can be increased, but diffusion remains the main
mechanism of mass transport within the tissue. Diffusional transport of oxygen to cardiac
myocytes within dish-grown constructs resulted in prevalently anaerobic glucose metabolism
[31]. Additional limitation of the culture in static or mixed dishes is that the bottom surface of the
construct (the surface closest to the bottom of the dish) often lacks proper oxygenation and
nutrients yielding asymmetric cell distribution with compact tissue mostly on the top surface.
To improve cell survival and assembly on all surfaces of the engineered tissue, cardiac
constructs were cultivated suspended in the spinner flasks (Table 2.2). Cultivation in spinner
flasks (at stirring rates of up to 90 rpm) improved construct properties [26], presumably due to
enhanced mass transport at construct surfaces (Figure2.2). After 2 weeks of culture, constructs
from mixed flasks had significantly higher cellularity index (-20ggDNA/construct) and
metabolic activity (-150MTTunits/mg DNA) than those from static flasks (-.5ggDNA/construct
and -50 MTT units/mg DNA). Mixing maintained medium gas and pH levels within the
physiological range yielding a more aerobic glucose metabolism (L/G-1.5) in mixed flasks as
compared to static flaks (L/G>2) [26]. Constructs contained a peripheral tissue-like region (50-
70gm thick) in which cells stained positive for tropomyosin and organized in multiple layers in a
24
3-D configuration [37] Electrophysiological studies conducted using a linear array of
extracellular electrodes showed that the peripheral layer of the constructs sustained
macroscopically continuous impulse propagation on a centimeter-size scale [37]. However,
construct interiors remained empty due to the diffusional limitations of the oxygen transport
within the bulk tissue, and the density of viable myocytes was orders of magnitude lower than
that in the neonatal rat ventricles [37]. Additional drawback of the cultivation in spinner flasks is
that turbulent flow conditions may induce cell damage and dedifferentiation and result in the
formation of a fibrous capsule at construct surfaces.

Laminar conditions of flow in rotating vessels (Table 2.2) enabled the maintenance of oxygen
concentration in medium and pH within the physiological range, and resulted in mostly aerobic
cell metabolism (L/G-1) [26]. The metabolic activity of cells within constructs increased into the
range of values measured for neonatal rat ventricles (-250 units MTT/mg DNA) and was
significantly higher than in mixed flasks (-150 units MTT/mg DNA). The index of cell
hyperthrophy was also comparable to the neonatal tissue (18mg protein/mg DNA). However, the
construct cellularity remained 2-6 times lower than in native heart ventricles. In the best
experimental group (heart cells enriched for cardiac myocytes by pre-plating, laminin-coated
PGA scaffolds, low serum concentration) the outer layer of viable tissue was up to 160 gm thick
[27]. Cells expressed cardiac-specific markers (e.g., tropomyosin, gap junction protein connexin,
creatin kinase-MM, sarcomeric myosin heavy chain) at levels that were lower than in neonatal rat
ventricles but higher than in constructs cultured in spinner flasks [27]. Electrophysiological
properties were also improved, as evidenced by the prolonged action potential duration (APD, a
measure of electrophysiological functionality of cell membrane), higher maximum capture rates
(a measure of construct response to electrical pacing), and more physiological response to drugs.
In particular, pharmacological studies done with 4-aminopyridine indicated that a decrease in
transient outward potassium current may be responsible for the observed differences in APD and
MCR [29]. Overall, dynamic laminar flow of rotating bioreactors improved properties of the
peripheral tissue layer, but the limitations of the diffusional transport of oxygen to the construct
interior were not overcome and constructs remained largely acellular.
Interstitial flow. In an attempt to enhance mass transport within cultured constructs, a perfusion
bioreactors was developed that provides interstitial medium flow through the cultured construct at
velocities similar to those found in native myocardium (-400-500 !xm/s, [47]). In such a system
oxygen and nutrients are supplied to the construct interior by both diffusion and convection.
In early studies, constructs were prepared by seeding cardiac myocytes onto PGA scaffolds in
mixed flasks, a method that has been successfully used to seed chondrocytes. After 3 days,
constructs were transferred into a perfusion cartridge and pulsatile flow of medium through the
construct was provided by a peristaltic pump (0.2 -3 ml/min) (Table 2.2). Gas exchange between
culture medium and incubator air occurred in an external coil of silicone tubing within the
medium recirculation loop. Perfusion during construct cultivation improved cell distribution,
viability and differentiation. However, the overall cell density remained low due to the limitations
of oxygen transport to the cells inside constructs during scaffold seeding in mixed flasks [43, 45].
27
Mechanical stimulation. To provide appropriate mechanical stimulation neonatal rat cardiac
myocytes were reconstituted in collagen gel and cultivated in the presence of cyclic stretch
(Table 2.2). In one set-up neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were suspended in a gel consisting of
collagen I and Matrigel [40]. For each piece of tissue, 0.7 ml of the cell/gel mix was poured into a
well ( 1 x 17 x 4 mm) made of silicone rubber containing one set of Velcro coated silicone tubes
(7 mm length, 3mm OD 2mm ID). The mixture was allowed to gel at 37Â°C for 60 min before
culture medium was added. After 4 days in culture, tissues were transferred for an additional 6
days into a motorized stretching device that applied either unidirectional and cyclic stretch (1.5
Hz, strain rate of up to 20%). Mechanical stimulation enhanced the alignment of cardiac
myocytes, and resulted in higher mitochondrial density and longer myofilaments. As compared to
the non-stimulated controls, stimulation markedly increased the RNA/DNA ratio (by 100 %) and
protein/cell ratio (by 50 %). The force of contraction was also higher in stretched constructs, both
under basal conditions and after stimulation with isoprenaline [40].
In an improved set-up, neonatal rat cardiac cells were suspended in the collagen/Matrigel mix
and cast into circular molds [32]. After 7 days in culture, the strips of cardiac tissue were placed
around two rods each fixed to a stretching bar of a custom made mechanical stretcher and
subjected to unidirectional and cyclic stretch at 10% strain rate and 2 Hz. Mechanical stimulation
improved the formation of interconnected and aligned cardiac muscle bundles with
morphological features resembling adult rather than immature native tissue. Fibroblasts and
macrophages were found through the constructs, and the capillary structures positive for CD31
were also noted. Cardiomyocytes exhibited well developed ultrastructural features: sarcomeres
arranged in myofibrils, with well developed Z, I, A H and M bands, gap and adherence junctions,
T tubules, and well developed basement membrane. The constructs exhibited contractile
properties similar to the native tissue with high ratio of twitch to resting tension and strong -
adrenegenic response. Action potentials characteristic of rat ventricular myocytes were recorded.
Using another system for mechanical stimulation, cyclic mechanical stretch (1.33Hz) was
applied to the constructs based on collagen scaffold and human heart cells (isolated from children
undergoing repair of Tetralogy of Fallot) [46]. A rectangular piece of tissue was fixed at one end
to the bottom of a square dish; the other end is attached to a steel rod the cyclic movement of
which is induced by dynamically changing magnetic filed. Constructs subjected to chronic stretch
had improved cell distribution and collagen matrix formation.
28
Summary
Tissue engineering can provide functional cell-based grafts to restore normal function of a
compromised native tissue and to serve as physiologically relevant models for biological
research. One approach to functional tissue engineering involves the in vitro cultivation of
immature but functional tissue constructs by using: (i) cells isolated from a small tissue harvest
and expanded in vitro, (ii) a biodegradable scaffold designed to serve as a structural and logistic
template for tissue development, and (iii) a bioreactor designed to provide environmental
conditions necessary for the cells to regenerate a functional tissue structure.

3. HIGH DENSITY SEEDING OF MYOCYTE CELLS FOR CARDIAC TISSUE
ENGINEERING2
INTRODUCTION
Due to the limited ability of cardiac myocytes to regenerate [ attempts have been made
to repair myocardial injuries by injecting myogenic cells into the scarred myocardium [2-4], or in
the case of large injuries to replace scarred tissue with engineered grafts [5, 6]. Three dimensional
tissue constructs that express structural and physiological features characteristic of native cardiac
muscle have been engineered using collagen gels [7-9], collagen fibers [10], collagen sponges [6,
11] and polyglycolic acid meshes [12-14], in conjunction with fetal or neonatal rat cardiac
myocytes. In all cases, cells were seeded on scaffolds and cultivated immersed in culture medium
in dishes [5, 6, 12, 14], spinner flasks [12-14] or rotating vessels [10, 12, 14]. Oxygen dissolved
in medium was transported to the cells by molecular diffusion, which provided enough oxygen
for an approximately 100 gm thick outer layer of functional tissue but not to the construct interior
which remained relatively acellular [8, 12-14].
We previously developed a perfused bioreactor system in an attempt to enhance mass
transport between culture medium and cells within cultured constructs [15]. Cells were seeded
onto scaffolds in tissue culture dishes for 48 hours and subsequently cultured for 7 days with
direct perfusion of culture medium. The transport of oxygen from the medium to the cells
occurred via diffusion during cell seeding, and by a combination of diffusion and convection
during cultivation. During cultivation, the flow of medium redistributed the cells evenly across
the entire volume of the construct, but the cell density remained low due to the limitations in
oxygen transport during cell seeding.
We hypothesized that rapid gel inoculation of hypoxia-sensitive cells in conjunction with
direct medium perfusion through the seeded scaffold would result in high rate, yield, viability and
uniformity of cell seeding. We report a new seeding strategy that enables the seeding of tissue
engineering scaffolds at the initial cell densities comparable to those in adult rat myocardium
(-108 cells/cm3, [16]), and was developed by combining the methods for rapid cell inoculation
using a gel [17] and scaffold seeding with cell suspension in perfusion systems [18]. Medium
perfusion through the cell-polymer construct is established immediately, in order to maintain the
viability of inoculated cells during cell attachment to scaffolds and subsequent construct

cultivation. The feasibility of the proposed seeding method was first evaluated in seeding and
cultivation studies with neonatal cardiac myocytes. Subsequently, the effects of three system
parameters (initial cell number, seeding time, seeding set-up) were systematically studied using
C2C12 mouse muscle myoblast cell line. C2C12 cells were chosen as a model system due to their
availability, ease of handling and evidence that they differentiate and express cardiac specific
proteins [19-21] when grafted into the rat or mouse myocardium.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials Dulbecco's modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), N-2-
Hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-Ethane-Sulfonic Acid (HEPES), calcium and magnesium free

Solution (HBSS) and penicillin were all from Gibco (Grand Island, NY). Collagenase Type II
was from Worthington (Freehold, NJ). Trypsin was from U.S. Biochemicals (Cleveland, OH).
MatrigelÂ® and dispase were from Becton-Dickinson (Two Oak Park, Bedford, MA). The C2C12
mouse muscle myoblast cell line was from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA). Tissue culture dishes and T175 flasks were from Costar (Cambridge, MA). 10% Formalin
buffer was from Sigma Diagnostic (St. Louis, MO). Ethidium monoazide bromide (EMA) was
from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The flow cytometer (model FACScan) was from Becton-
Dickinson (Bedford, MA). Orbital shaker was from Bellco, (type BTB, Vineland, NJ) and the
Push/Pull PHD2000 syringe pump was from Harvard Apparatus (Holliston, MA). Polycarbonate
perfusion cartridges were kindly donated by the Advanced Tissue Sciences (LaJolla, CA).
Platinum cured silicone tubing and the multichannel peristaltic pump (L/Sm Masterflex) were
from Cole-Parmer (Vernon Hills, IL). Reservoir bag was 32 ml gas permeable VueLife bag
(American Fluoroseal Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD). Syringes were from Becton Dickinson
(Two Oak Park, Bedford, MA) and three-way stop-cocks from Baxter Healthcare (Irvin, CA).
Heating tape was from VWR (Bridgeport, Connecticut). The temperature controller was from
Barnstead/Thermolyne (Dubuque, Iowa). The programmable cardiac stimulator was from Nihon
Kohden (type SEC-3102). The electrodes (cm x 0.5cm) were custom made by coating 500 gm
thick silicon wafers with 3000 A of silicon nitride, 100 A of Ti, and 1000 A of gold.
C2C12 cells, a cell line derived from murine myoblasts, were subcultured in T-75 flasks
(P4 to P9) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/L glucose,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine N'-2-
ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin. In order to prepare
33
constructs, C2C12 cells at passage numbers ranging from 4 to 9 were dissociated with trypsin and
counted using a hemocytometer.
Cardiomyocytes were obtained from I to 2 day old neonatal Sprague Dawley rats using
a protocol approved by the Institute's Committee on Animal Care. In brief, ventricles were
quartered, incubated overnight at 4Â°C in a 0.06 % (w/v) solution of trypsin in Hank's Balanced
Salt Solution (HBSS), washed in culture medium, and subjected to a series of digestions (3 min,
37Â°C, 150 rpm) in 0.1 % (w/v) solution of collagenase type II in HBSS. The first digestate was
discarded, and the cell suspensions from the subsequent 4 -6 digestions were centrifuged (750
rpm, 4 min), resuspended in HBSS each, pooled, and resuspended in DMEM containing 4.5 g/L
glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 units/ml
penicillin. Cells were pre-plated for one 60 min period to enrich for cardiomyocytes (i.e. cells that
remained unattached were used to prepare constructs). Cell number and viability were determined
by hemocytometer and either trypan blue exclusion or fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)
described below. Approximately 20 hearts from two different rat litters were used.
Scaffolds were discs punched from sheets of UltrafoamÂ® collagen hemostat (Davol Inc.,
Cranston, RI), a water-insoluble, partial HC1 salt of purified bovine dermal (corium) collagen
formed as a sponge with interconnected pores. Discs had dry dimensions of 1.33 cm diameter x
0.3 cm thick, and dimensions of 1.1 cm diameter x 0.15 cm thick following hydration in culture
medium for hr in a 37 Â°C incubator.
Gel inoculation Scaffolds were inoculated with cells at the density of 0.68.108 or
1.35 108 cells/cm3as follows. UltrafoamTMdiscs were preweted with culture medium and placed
into the 37Â°C 5%C02 humidified incubator (Napco, Winchester, VA) for one hour before
inoculation. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 10 min) and resuspended in
Matrigel(gÂ®, a basement membrane preparation extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm
mouse sarcoma and solubilized in DMEM at the concentration of 7.458 mg/ml. Cells (6 or 12- 106
per scaffold) were resuspended using 5 gl of liquid MatrigelÂ® per one million cells, while
working on ice to prevent premature gelation (MatrigelÂ® is liquid at 2-8 Â°C and it gels rapidly at
22-35Â°C). Pre-wetted scaffolds were gently blotted dry and the MatrigelÂ®/cell suspension was
delivered evenly to the top surface of each scaffold using an automatic pipette. Gelation was
achieved within 10 min of the transfer of inoculated scaffolds into either orbitally mixed dishes or
perfused cartridges as described below.
Seeding and cultivation Orbitally Mixed Dishes: Six-well tissue culture dishes
containing one gel-cell inoculated scaffold and 8 ml of culture medium per well were placed on a
25 rpm orbital shaker and incubated at 37Â°C/5%CO 2in a humidified incubator to serve as
34
controls. Perfused cartridges: All components (cartridges, screens, gaskets, tubing) were steam
sterilized for 30 min. Two seeding loops, each containing one perfused cartridge, were placed
onto a Push/Pull syringe pump as shown in Figure 3. 1. Each cartridge was connected to two 80
cm long coils of 1.6mm ID, 3.2mm OD platinum cured silicone tubing serving as gas exchangers,
and two 10 mL syringes serving as medium reservoirs, sampling ports and for de-bubbling.
Cartridges were completely filled with culture medium, with the use of a pair of 3 mL syringes,
one full and one empty, connected to the circuit at the inlet and outlet of the cartridge via 3-way
stopcocks. The total volume of medium in the cartridge, tubing and reservoir syringes was 8 mL
(1.5 mL in the cartridge, 4 mL in the tubing, 2.5 mL in one syringe; the other syringe was empty).
Gel-cell inoculated scaffolds were placed between two stainless steel screens and two
silicone gaskets, and transferred into 1.5 ml polycarbonate perfusion cartridges (one scaffold per
cartridge). The screens (85% open area) provided mechanical support during perfusion and the
gaskets (1 mm thick, 10 mm OD, 5 mm ID) routed the culture medium directly through the
construct. Any air bubbles were displaced by culture medium injected from the de-bubbling
syringe (Syringe 2, Figure 3.1) into the downstream syringe (Syringe 4, Figure 3.1). The seeding
set-up was placed in a 37Â°C/5%CO 2incubator, and the pump was programmed to the set flow
rate, with the reversal of flow direction after 2.5ml was perfused in a given direction.
The cartridges containing constructs seeded with neonatal cardiac myocytes were
transferred into perfusion loops consisting of a reservoir bag, a gas exchanger (a coil of silicone
tubing, 3m long) and a multichannel peristaltic pump. Each loop was primed with 32 ml of
culture medium, unidirectional medium flow was established, and the flow rate was set at
0.5ml/min and maintained throughout the cultivation. Constructs cultured in dishes (one
constructs in 8 mL medium per well) placed on an orbital shaker (25 rpm) served as controls.

Experimental design In feasibility studies, scaffolds were inoculated with 12 x 106
neonatal cardiac myocytes and seeded in perfusion or orbitally mixed dish for 1.5 hr as described
above. After seeding constructs were cultured for 7 days either with direct perfusion of culture
medium; orbitally mixed dishes served as controls. Constructs were evaluated at the end of
cultivation with respect to cell number, viability and metabolic activity, expression of sarcomeric
a-actin, and contractile responses to electrical stimulation as described below.
For systematical seeding studies with C2C12 cells a randomized factorial experimental
design was used with three factors: seeding time T (two levels: 1.5 and 4.5 hr), initial cell number
C (two levels: 6 x 106 and 12 x 106 cells/scaffold), and seeding set-up S (three levels: dishes on an
orbital shaker set to 25 rpm; perfusion at 0.5 mL/min and perfusion at 1.5 mL/min). Three
independent seeding experiments were performed (n = 3 for all measurements) for each
combination of the three factors.
36(5)
This experimental design was selected in order to assess the individual effects of the three
seeding factors (T, S, C), three possible two-factor interactions (T*C, T*S, C*S) and one possible
three-factor interaction (T*S*C). The seeding time was set to 1.5 hr (low) and 4.5 hr (high), based
on the attachment times of 1-4 hrs reported for cardiomycoytes seeded on surfaces coated with
collagen IV, laminin and fetal bovine serum [22-24], and attachment times of 1-5 hrs reported for
C2C12 cells seeded on untreated glass surfaces (Acarturk et al., 1998) or laminin and collagen
covered glass (unpublished data from our laboratory). Since Matrigel contains both laminin
and collagen type IV and the Ultrafoam contains collagens type I and II, it was expected that most
cells would attach within 1.5 h.
The cell numbers (6 and 12.106 cells per scaffold disc) corresponded to the cell densities
of 0.68.108 and 1.35.108 cells/cm3that were on the same order as those measured for the adult rat
myocardium (5 .108 cells/cm3, [16]). The minimum flow rate in perfused cartridges was
determined from the mass balance of oxygen supply by culture medium and consumption by the
cells for the high cell density:
F(Cin-Cout)=RN (1)
where F (cm3/min) is the flow rate of culture medium, Cm=220 gmol/L and C0ot=0 gmol/L are
inlet and outlet oxygen concentrations in culture medium, respectively, R=3.62 nmol/min/106is
the oxygen consumption rate of C2C12 cells at normoxic conditions [25] and N=12 .106 is the
higher of the two total cell numbers. In order to assure a margin of safety, the low value of flow
rate was set to 0.5 ml/min (Level II of the factor set-up) and the high value was set to 1.5 ml/min
(Level III of the factor set-up).
Analytical methods Constructs were sampled aRfter 10 min of gelation, at the end of the
1.5 or 4.5 hr seeding period, and after 7 days of cultivation and evaluated with respect to the cell
number, viability, metabolism and spatial distribution. Glucose and lactate concentrations were
assessed in culture medium sampled at the end of 1.5-hr or 4.5-hr seeding period from the
perfuion loop or Petri dishes, using glucose and L-lactate analyzer Model 2300 STAT Plus
(Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH). For histological evaluation, constructs were
fixed in 10% formalin buffer for 24 hr, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5gm thick)
in cross-section through the center and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). Cardiac
myocyte constructs were immunostained with monoclonal anti a-actin (sarcomeric, mouse gM
isotype) as described previously (Carrier et al., 1999).
The seeding cell yield and cell viability were assessed prior to seeding, after 10 min of
gelation, and after 1.5 hr or 4.5 hr of scaffold seeding. Initial cell populations (trypsinized C2C 12
cells, freshly isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes) were aliquoted into Petri dish wells and EMA
37
was added (10 p1 of 50 g/ml solution per I x 106 cells suspended in 100 l PBS). Constructs
were diced into approximately 2 mm x 2 mm cubes in a Petri dish and OOpIl of PBS and 10 pi of
EMA solution (50 gg/ml) per I x 106 cells seeded were added. The dishes were placed on ice
under fluorescent light at the distance of 18 cm for 10 min to allow for EMA to cross link to DNA
of non-viable cells. To obtain single cell suspensions for cell count and fluorescence activated
cells sorting (FACS), the EMA labeled constructs were digested with collagenase and dispase (10
ml of solution containing 0.6 mg/ml collagenase type II with 282 units/mg and 1.2 units/ml of
dispase in culture medium per construct) for 30 min at 37Â°C, and 30 min on ice, with periodic
pipetting to dissociate cell aggregates. EMA-labeled dissociated cells were rinsed with culture
medium and counted using a hemocytometer (VWR, Bridgeport, NJ). Cells were separated by
centrifugation (1000rpm, 10 min), resuspended in PBS at the concentration of 106cells/ml and
subjected to FACS.
The following parameters were calculated for triplicate samples: (i) total seeding yield,
defined as the ratio of the number of cells harvested from the construct and the number of cells
initially seeded onto the scaffold, (ii) change in cell viability, defined as the difference between
the viability of cells in the initial cell population (i.e. prior to scaffold seeding) and that of the
cells harvested from constructs, and (iii) live cell yield, defined as the ratio of the numbers of live
cells harvested from the construct and initially seeded onto the scaffold.
The electrophysiological function of engineered cardiac constructs was evaluated by
monitoring contractile activity upon electrical stimulation. Each constructs was placed between
two gold electrodes connected to a cardiac stimulator, in a 100 mm Petri dish filled with 120 ml
Tyrode's solution (140 mM NaCI, 5.4 mM KCI, 0.33mMNaH 2PO4, 1.8mM CaCI2, ImM MgCl2,
5mM HEPES, 5.5mM D-glucose). The pH of the Tyrode's solution was adjusted to 7.4 and the
temperature was maintained at 37Â°C using a heating tape fixed to the bottom of the Petri dish and
connected to a temperature controller. The entire set-up was placed on an optical microscope.
Contractile responses to electrical stimuli (monophasic pulses, 2ms duration) were monitored
using a lOx magnification. The stimulation was applied at a rate of Hz starting at an amplitude
of V. The amplitude was gradually increased until the excitation threshold was reached and the
entire construct started to beat synchronously. Discs cored out of perfusion constructs were
compared to dish constructs and full thickness slices of left ventricles of 2 day old neonatal
Sprague-Dawley rats (sections obtained by bisecting ventricle parallel to the base apex line).
Statistical Analysis The individual effects and interactions between seeding factors were
determined by three factor analysis of variance (Multiway ANOVA) using SAS 8.0 for Unix
38
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) [26, 27]. P<0.05 was considered significant. The proportion of
variance explained by each factor or interaction 2 was calculated as described in Lindman [27]:
(t02=effect /ttal (2)
where ef2ect is the estimate of variance explained by the given effect and (y2total is the estimate
of total data variance. Pairwise comparisons between certain experimental groups were performed
by Student's t-test.
RESULTS
Feasibility studies. Feasibility of the proposed method was assessed by inoculating
scaffolds (1.1 mm diameter x 1.5 mm thick discs following hydration) with neonatal rat cardiac
myocytes (12.106 per scaffold) and placing the resulting constructs either in perfused cartridges
(0.5 ml/min) or in orbitally mixed dishes (25 rpm) for a period of 1.5 h. Total seeding yield was
slightly but not significantly lower in the perfusion group than in the dishes (Table 3.1). The
decrease in cell viability during seeding was markedly lower in perfusion than in dishes. The
molar ratio of lactate produced to glucose consumed, an index of cell aerobicity, was also
significantly lower in perfusion than in dishes.
To asses the impact of seeding procedure in the long term culture, scaffolds inoculated
with 12- 106 neonatal cardiac myocytes and seeded in perfusion (0.5 ml/min) or orbitally mixed
dishes (25 rpm) for 1.Shr were cultivated for additional 7 days in perfusion (0.5 ml/min) or
orbitally mixed dish (25 rpm), respectively. Perfusion was associated with (a) negligible decrease
in cell viability, presumably due to the maintenance of aerobic cell metabolism as evidenced by a
relatively low lactate-to-glucose ratio, and (b) decrease in the total seeding yield, presumably due
to the wash-out of unattached cells (Table 3.1). In contrast, cell viability markedly decreased in
dishes, a result consistent with more anaerobic cell metabolism evidenced by a relatively high
lactate-to-glucose ratio (Table 3.1). Cell patches expressing sarcomeric a-actin were relatively
uniformly distributed throughout constructs cultivated in perfusion, and confined within only a
200-300gm thick top layer of constructs cultivated in dishes (Figure 3. 2a).
Spontaneous construct beating was not observed in either group after 7 days of
cultivation, suggesting that cells were functionally assembled into tissue-like structures.
Consistently, in response to electrical stimulation (e.g., at 5V and 1 Hz) constructs from both
groups were reproducibly induced to contract synchronously (please see the video clip).
However, the constructs cultured in perfusion maintained constant frequency of contractions,
whereas the constructs cultivated in orbitally mixed dishes spontaneously increased beating
frequencies and every -2 min exhibited episodes resembling arrhythmia. The excitation
39
threshold of the constructs cultivated in perfusion was lower but not significantly than that
measured for constructs cultured in dishes, and both excitation thresholds were significantly
higher then those measured for neonatal rat ventricles (Figure 3. 2b).

Detailed studies of seeding parameters. The effects of seeding set-up (S; three levels),
seeding time (T; two levels) and initial cell number (C; two levels) were systematically assessed
by inoculating scaffolds with C2C 12 cells. After 10 min of gelation, scaffolds inoculated with 6
and 12 106 cells had total cell yields of 101 + 12 % and 102 + 15 %, respectively, and decreases
in cell viability of 0.29 + 2.03 % and 5.78 + 2.31 %, respectively.
Total cell yield. Total seeding yields were consistently high in all groups (Figure 3. 3 a,
d). The differences between groups were not statistically significant, except for slightly but
significantly lower yield in the high flow rate (1.5 ml/min) perfusion group, presumably due to
washout of unattached cells. The total yield depended on the individual effects of the seeding set-
up (p = 0.0081), and seeding time (p = 0.0075), but not on the initial cell number (Table 3.2).
The fractions of the observed variance that could be attributed to seeding set-up and time were r
= 0.15 and ai = 0.12, respectively.

Change in cell viability. For constructs seeded in dishes, cell viability markedly
decreased with both the duration of seeding (1.5 vs. 4.5 hr, Figure 3.3 b, e) and initial cell
number (6 vs. 12 million, Figure 3.3 b, e), such that constructs seeded with 12 million cells for
4.5 h contained more than 50 % non-viable cells (Figure 3.3e). For constructs that were perfused
at low flow rate (0.5 ml/min), the same trend was less pronounced, such that constructs seeded
with 12 million cells contained approximately 20% non-viable cells at 4.5 h post-seedign (Figure
2 e). Importantly, for constructs perfused at high flow rate (1.5 ml/min), neither the duration of
seeding nor the initial cell number had any significant effect on cell viability (Figure 3.3 b, e).
Overall, the decrease in cell viability in constructs seeded in dishes was an order of magnitude
higher than that in either perfusion group, and the effects of the seeding method (dish vs.
perfusion) were most pronounced for high initial cell number (12-106) and longer seeding time
(4.5hr).
The change in cell viability was influenced by all seeding parameters, both individually
and interactively (Table 3.2). The most significant effects were seeding set-up, S (p < 0.0001),

initial cell number, C (p < 0.0001) and the interaction between the seeding time and set-up, T*S
(p < 0.0001). The highest fraction of the observed variance, 0.56, could be attributed to the
seeding set-up alone; an additional fraction of 0.17 could be attributed to the interactive effects of
seeding set up and seeding time (Table 3.2).

Live cell yield. There was no significant effect of the seeding set-up on the yield of live
cells at the low initial cell number (6 million cells) or for the short seeding period (1.5 h) (Fig
3.3c, f). However, as either the initial cell number or the seeding time was increased, perfusion at
either flow rate yielded significantly more live cells (up to 50%) than dishes. The live cell yield
was influenced by the seeding set-up S (p = 0.0002), seeding time T (p < 0.0001), and initial cell
number C (p = 0.005) as well as interactions between the seeding set-up and time T*S (p =
0.008). The highest fractions of the observed variance could be attributed to the seeding set-up
(0.20) and time (0.27).
To further characterize the kinetics of change in the live cell numbers, cell viability was
measured at the beginning of seeding (t = 0), after 10 min (i.e., after MatrigelÂ® gelation), and
after 1.5 h and 4.5 h of seeding in either dishes or perfusion. The number of live cells on the
scaffold decreased exponentially with time according to the first order kinetic model. (Table 3.3)
The correlation coefficient was high (0.88 < r2< 0.998) in all groups except for one (12.106 cells
seeded in perfusion at 0.5 ml/min, r2= 0.56). The exponential decay time constant, , was
approximately twice as high in perfusion as compared to dishes. Perfusion at the low flow rate
yielded slightly but not significantly higher time constant than perfusion at the high flow rate.
The initial cell number had no significant effect on t.

Metabolic indices. The molar ratio of lactate produced to glucose consumed (L/G) was
used as an index of aerobicity; ideally L/G=1 for completely aerobic metabolism and L/G= 2 for
a completely anaerobic metabolism. The following trends were observed (Table 3.4): L/G was
lower in perfusion than in dishes; L/G increased as the seeding time increased; L/G was lower in
perfusion at the high than the low flow rate. Seeding time T (p = 0.005) and type of set-up S (p =
0.003) significantly influenced L/G (Table 3.2). Although the initial cell number C alone had no
effect on L/G, an interactive effect between seeding time and set-up T*C was observed (p =
0.002), that accounted for the highest fraction of data variance (at = 0.20), whereas independent
effects of T and S accounted for a = 0.17 and aor = 0.12, respectively.
The glucose consumption rate (G, mg/h), was used as a measure of the total metabolic
activity of attached cells. G was lowest for constructs seeded in dishes, intermediate for those
perfused at 0.5 ml/min and the highest for those perfused at 1.5 ml/min; the differences were
statistically significant for constructs seeded with 6 million cells for 4.5 h. G increased as the
initial cell number increased and decreased with an increase in seeding time. Consistent with
these observations were the results of multiway-ANOVA (Table 3.2) showing that G depended
on the individual effects of set-up S (p = 0.003), time T (p < 0.0001) and initial cell number C (p
< 0.0001). The variances that could be attributed to S, T and C were f = 0.09, Of = 0.33 and a
= 0.27, respectively.

Cell distribution. Cell distribution was evaluated from the full cross sections cut through
the centers of the constructs, by comparing cell densities in the top, center and bottom areas of a
0.65 gm wide strip extending from one construct surface to the other. Constructs seeded in dishes
generally exhibited non uniform cell distributions with most cells located in the 100-200 gm thick
layer at the top surface of the construct, and smaller number of cells that penetrated the entire
construct depth (Figure 3.4). Constructs seeded in perfusion exhibited spatially uniform
distributions of high cell density regions throughout the perfused volume of the construct (Figure
3.4), except the regions at outer edge of the construct which were shielded from the fluid flow by
silicone gaskets (Fig. 3.1). There was no significant difference in the appearance of constructs
seeded at 0.5 ml/min and 1.5 ml/min (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
We report that gel-cell inoculation into a scaffold followed immediately by the
establishment of perfusion of culture medium through the construct can be utilized to generate
tissue engineered constructs with high initial densities of viable myocytic cells. The work was
motivated by the need to optimize seeding of 3D scaffolds with hypoxia-sensitive cells at
physiological densities. General seeding requirements for 3-D scaffolds include (a) high yield, to
maximize the utilization of donor cells, (b) high kinetic rate, to minimize time in suspension for
anchorage dependent cells, (c) spatially uniform distribution of attached cells, to provide basis for
uniform tissue regeneration (d) high initial construct cellularity to enhance the rate of tissue
development and (e) appropriate nutrient and oxygen supply to maintain cell viability during the
seeding procedure.
Polymer scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering have been seeded using a variety of
techniques: adding of a concentrated cell suspension onto the scaffold [6, 11], seeding in well
mixed suspension of cardiomyocytes in orbitally mixed dishes [12], spinner flasks [12, 13] or
rotating vessels [14], and a combination of the two approaches [14]. All of these methods resulted
in constructs with viable cells concentrated at the construct surfaces, most likely due to the
diffusional limitations of oxygen supply to the construct interior. Perfusion through the constructs
that were prepared by seeding scaffolds with cell suspension in mixed flasks resulted in
redistribution of the cells throughout the entire volume of the construct [15, 28]. However, cell
density remained low, presumably due to the 1-3 day long seeding in flasks which limited the
total cell number. Therefore, in order to engineer tissue constructs with high and spatially uniform
46
cell concentrations it is necessary to overcome oxygen diffusional limitations throughout both
steps: scaffold seeding and construct cultivation.

Rapid inoculation of large numbers of cells onto the scaffold (corresponding to the initial
cell densities of 0.67 -1.35 108 cell/cm3) using MatrigelÂ® was combined with flow perfusion to
enhance mass transport to and from the cells and thereby maintain cell viability. Alternating flow
was utilized to minimize cell washout during attachment, and to maintain unrestricted flow
through the scaffold pores. Matrigel Â® was selected because it contains laminin and collagen IV
known to promote surface attachment of cardiac myocytes [22-24]. Feasibility studies were
carried out using neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, because these are the most frequently used cells
in cardiac tissue engineering. Systematic studies were done using C2C12 myocyte cells because
these cells are readily available, well characterized, and representative of hypoxia sensitive cells
such as cardiomyocytes.
Medium perfusion maintained the viability of cardiac myocytes during both the seeding
(1.5 or 4.5 h) and the cultivation (7 days), while the cell yield remained comparable for constructs
cultured in perfusion and in dishes (Table 3.1). Direct perfusion of culture medium resulted in
uniform cell distributions (Figure 3.2a) and substantially higher cell densities than in any of the
previous studies done by ourselves or others (Carrier et al, 2002a; Carrier et al, 2002b). Perfusion
also resulted in constructs that contracted synchronously in response to electrical stimulation. The
maintenance of perfusion at all times during scaffold seeding and construct cultivation is thus
essential for achieving physiological densities of viable cells.
The finding of high total yields for both cardiac myocytes (Table 3.1) and C2C12 cells
(Fig. 3.3a, d), under all conditions tested and independent on the initial cell number or seeding set
up (Table 3.2), implies that the cells were apparently "locked" into the scaffold during the 10 min
gelation period. The slight decrease in the total yield between .5h and 4.5h (Fig 3.3a, d) is likely
due to the detachment of dead or loosely bound cells and wash away by flow in perfusion. The
gelation itself had no adverse effects on cell viability, which implied that all observed effects
were due to other factors associated with cell seeding. Gel inoculation thus satisfies the
requirement of high seeding yield that maximizes donor cell utilization, an essential feature for
cells with limited proliferation potential such as cardiomyocytes.
Establishment of medium perfusion through the construct immediately after gelation was
essential for the maintenance of cell viability, as suggested by Multiway-ANOVA analysis
demonstrating that the change in cell viability was influenced the most by the type of seeding set-
up used (Table 3.2, o2=0.56 for the seeding set-up, S). Accordingly, the change in viability was
the smallest for cells seeded in perfusion at high flow rate and the largest for cells seeded in the
orbital dishes. At longer times (4.5h), the decrease in viability was 3- or 9-fold higher for
constructs seeded in dishes as compared to those seeded at low or high perfusion flow rate,
48
respectively (Figure 3.2 b, e). Such profound differences are most likely the result of insufficient
diffusional supply of oxygen within constructs seeded in orbital dishes as compared to those
seeded in perfusion where oxygen and nutrients are supplied by a combination of diffusion and
convection. Relatively smaller decreases in viability in perfusion groups at longer seeding times
(4.5 h) as compared to shorter seeding time (1.5 h) (Fig 3.3a, d) is consistent with the fact that
damaged or dead cells are gradually washed away by flow leaving only healthy and viable cells
on the scaffold. If not removed promptly from the tissue construct, the damaged cells could
potenatially send apoptosis signals to the neighboring healthy cells or to release harmful
intracellular compounds into the environment that can cause further damage.
The yield of the live cells is the parameter most likely to determine the success of any
seeding procedure, and it depends on the total yield and change in viability. When seeding times
are short enough for the cells to tolerate hypoxia, and the cell concentrations are relatively low to
limit the metabolic needs, cell seeding in dishes can yield acceptable results (Figure 3.3c, data for
6 million cells per construct and 1.5 h seeding time). However, with an increase in time, cell
number or both, hypoxia-induced cell damage increases and the advantages of seeding in
perfusion become evident (Figure 3.3f, data for 12 million cells per construct and 4.5 h seeding
time). Consistently, the molar ratio of the lactate produced to glucose consumed was influenced
by the interaction between seeding set-up and initial cell number (Table 3.2, ao = 0.20 for the
S*C interaction) In scaffolds seeded at low densities, cells maintained aerobic metabolism even in
orbital dishes, whereas in scaffolds seeded at high densities, the limitations of oxygen diffusion
became rather significant (Table 3.4).
The decrease in number of viable cells with time in culture was characterized by the first
order exponential decay (Table 3.3). Regardless of the cell number, the time constant for both
perfusion groups ( 25 -30 h) was approximately twice as that in dishes (12 -15 hr). Based on
the time constants, a given cell number can be supported two times longer in perfusion then in the
orbital shaker. The observed decrease in live cell number in perfusion is a result of a specific
technique used for construct fixation between two gaskets that prevented fluid flow around the
construct and shield the flow through the construct periphery. Medium did not perfuse the
peripheral region of the construct, and the cells that are located between the two gaskets are
experiencing at least partial oxygen and nutrient deprivation, a more anaerobic metabolism with
increased L/G ratio, and eventually the loss of cell viability. However, this "necrotic edge" can be
trimmed off before use, to obtain constructs with an essentially 100% cell viability.
Most of the cells in the constructs seeded in dishes were located in the 100 -200 m
thick top layer. When the cell/gel suspension was applied to pre-wetted scaffolds, about half of it
49
penetrates the construct by capillary forces, and the rest forms a layer on the top surface. In
contrast, flow helps distribute the high-density cell patches evenly across the central part of the
constructs seeded in perfusion (Figure 3.4).
In summary, the present study demonstrated that gel/cell inoculation in conjunction with
the immediate establishment of alternating-flow perfusion enabled rapid and spatially uniform
seeding of myocytic cells at densities close to physiological while maintaining cell viability. The
experiments of this kind could be extended to a variety of cell/scaffold systems of interest for
tissue engineering. We anticipate that the benefits of gel-cell seeding with perfusion would be the
most obvious in the high density seeding of hypoxia sensitive cells such as cardiomyocytes.

CONTRACTILE CARDIAC TISSUE 3
INTRODUCTION
The limited ability of cardiac muscle to regenerate after myocardial infarction motivates
studies aimed at curative treatment options. Engineered cardiac constructs may serve as grafts for
myocardial repair, but only if they are thick and compact, contain a high density of metabolically
active cardiomyocytes, and contract synchronously in response to electrical stimulation.
Cardiac constructs that expressed distinct structural and functional features characteristic of
differentiated myocardium have been engineered in vitro starting from cardiac myocytes in
conjunction with collagen gels [1-4], collagen fibers [5], collagen sponges [6-10], and
polyglycolic acid meshes [11-13], or by stacking confluent cell monolayers into thin pulsatile
sheets [14]. In some cases, in vitro cultivation involved the use of bioreactors [11-13] or the
application of mechanical stretch [1, 15, 16]. In all cases, oxygen transport through the tissue was
largely governed by molecular diffusion, which can support only a thin (100 -200 ugm) surface
layer of functional tissue, and leaves construct interior relatively acellular [4, 11].
Construct cultivation in perfused cartridges markedly improved the uniformity of cell
distribution, but the overall cell density remained low due to the limitations of diffusional oxygen
supply during scaffold seeding [17, 18]. In a recent study, we showed that gel inoculation, in
conjunction with interstitial flow of culture medium, enables rapid seeding of hypoxia-sensitive
cells (C2C12 cell line) at high and spatially uniform initial densities, and evaluated the feasibility
of the proposed method for seeding and cultivation of cardiomyocytes. Seeding in perfusion
yielded spatially uniform physiologic cell density, whereas dish-seeded constructs contained
viable cells only within a thin (100-200 gm) surface layer [10].
Based on these previous studies, we hypothesized that thick, compact and functional cardiac
constructs could be engineered in vitro by providing convective-diffusive oxygen transport
similar to that present in vivo between the capillary network and the cells within native
myocardium. To test this hypothesis, we established a culture system that maintained efficient
oxygen supply to the cells at all times during scaffold seeding and construct cultivation, and

characterized in detail construct metabolism, structure and function. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
were suspended in MatrigelÂ®, inoculated into collagen sponges at a physiologic cell density, and
cultured for 7 days. Medium perfusion through cell-seeded scaffolds was established within 10
min of cell inoculation and maintained throughout the duration of construct cultivation at an
interstitial velocity of 500 m/s corresponding to the average blood velocity within native
myocardium [19].
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue culture. Cardiomyocytes were obtained from I -2 day old neonatal Sprague Dawley
(Charles River) rats according to procedures approved by the Institute's Committee on Animal
Care, as previously described [11]. Porous collagen scaffolds (UltrafoamÂ®, Davol Inc.) formed as
11 mm diameter x 1.5 mm thick discs were inoculated at the density of 1.35-108cells/cm3scaffold
volume. Cells were suspended in MatrigelÂ® (Becton Dickinson) using 12 106 cells in 60 PtL
MatrigelÂ®, delivered into scaffolds and transferred immediately following gelation into either
orbitally mixed dishes or perfused cartridges as previously described [10].
In the perfused group, constructs were placed between two stainless steel screens and two
silicone gaskets, and transferred into 1.5 ml polycarbonate perfusion cartridges (kindly donated
by the Advanced Tissue Sciences, La Jolla, CA; one scaffold per cartridge). The screens (85%
open area) provided mechanical support during perfusion and the gaskets ( mm thick, 10 mm
OD, 5 mm ID) routed the culture medium through the central area of the construct. Constructs
were subjected to alternating flow perfusion at 0.5 mL/min for the first 1.5 h to prevent washout
of cardiomyocytes before they attach to the scaffold (Figure 4.1A) and then to unidirectional
perfusion for the duration of culture (an additional 7 days) (Figure 4.1B ). Control constructs
were cultivated in orbitally mixed dishes (25 rpm).

Figure4. 1. Perfused cartridges with interstitial flow of culture mediumn (A) Scaffold seeding.
Gel-cell inoculated scaffolds were placed between two stainless steel screens (7) and two silicone
gaskets (8), and transferred into cartridges (3, one scaffold per cartridge). The screens (85%
open area) provided mechanical support during perfusion and the gaskets ( mm thick 10 mm
OD, 5 mm ID) routed the culture medium directly through the construct. Air bubbles were
displaced by culture medium injected from the de-bubbling syringe (4) into the downstream
syringe (2). Each cartridge was placed in a perfusion loop consisting of a push-pull pump (6),
two gas exchangers (1, 5) and two syringes (2, 4). The total volume of medium was 8 mL. For a
period of 1.5 h, the pump was programmed to the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, with the reversal of
flow direction after 2.5 ml was perfused in a given direction. (B) Construct cultivation. Each
cartridge with a seeded construct (4) was transferred into a perfusion loop consisting of one
channel of a multi-channel peristaltic pump (1), gas exchanger (a coil of thin silicone tubing, 3m
long) (2), reservoir bag (3) and two syringes (5, 6). The total volume of medium in each loop was
32 mL. The flow rate was set at 0.5ml/min and maintained throughout the 7 day cultivation.
Constructs seeded and cultivated in orbitally mixed dishes (35 mm well, 8 mL medium, 25 rpm)
served as controls. (C) Flow visualization. top: bulk flow through the construct center, bottom:

Culture medium was Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, 4.5 g/L glucose)
supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 10 mM hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethane-
sulfonic acid (HEPES), 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin (all from Gibco).
Flow visualization. Fluid flow in the perfused cartridge fitted with Ultrafoamg) scaffold was
evaluated by introducing a pulse of methylene blue tracer dye (Sigma) into the inlet flow of
distilled water. The flow rate was set to 0.5 ml/min. In separate studies, a thin stream of red flow
tracer dye (VWR) was injected isokinetically 3 mm upflow of the scaffold, to evaluate any
dissipation of fluid flow across the cartridge. High resolution inages were taken using a digital
camera (Nikon Coolpix 900).
54A: Scaffold seedingr
Analytical methods Constructs and culture medium were sampled immediately post-seeding
and after 1.5 hr I day and 7 days of culture. Cell number, viability, metabolism (lactate yield on
glucose) and cell cycle were assessed at all time points; cell distribution, presence of contractile
proteins and contractile function were assessed at 7 days. A total of 26 rat litters (-260 heart
ventricles) was used in 10 independent experiments, with n = 2 -8 constructs per data point.
Cell number and cell viability were assessed using ethidium monoazide bromide (EMA) in
conjunction with fluorescence activated cells sorting (FACS) as previously described [10]. In
brief, EMA was added to aliquots of freshly isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes or constructs
(10 pil of 50 jig/ml solution per 1 x 106 cells suspended in 100 pl PBS) in 6-well dishes that were
placed on ice under fluorescent light for 10 min to allow for EMA to cross link to DNA of non-
viable cells. EMA labeled constructs were digested with collagenase and dispase (10 ml of
solution containing 0.6 mg/ml collagenase type II with 282 units/mg and 1.2 units/ml of dispase
in culture medium per construct) for 30 min at 37Â°C, and 30 min on ice, with periodic pipetting to
dissociate cell aggregates. EMA-labeled dissociated cells were rinsed with culture medium and
counted using a hemocytometer (VWR, Bridgeport, NJ). Cells were resuspended in PBS at the
concentration of 106cells/ml and subjected to FACS (FACScan, Becton-Dickinson). The change
in cell viability was calculated as the difference between the measured viabilities of freshly
isolated cells and cells harvested from digested constructs. As an independent measure of cell
damage and death, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was performed on samples of culture
medium after 1, 3 and 7 days of culture using a commercial kit (Chiron Diagnostics, East
Walpole MA), as described previously [11].
Cell metabolism was assessed from the molar ratio of lactate produced to glucose consumed
(ideally, I mol/mol for aerobic and 2 mol/mol for anaerobic metabolism). Glucose and lactate
concentrations were measured in culture medium sampled at timed intervals using glucose and L-
lactate analyzer Model 2300 STAT Plus (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, OH).
For cell cycle analysis, constructs were digested and cells were permeabilized in 70% ethanol
(1 ml/106cells) for 30min at 4C. After centrifugation (10 min, 1000 rpm) the pellet was
resuspended in solution of 50 jig/ml RNase A and 0.1% Triton X in PBS (0.5 ml/106cells) to
digest double-stranded RNA that might interfere with staining. Propidium iodide was added (50
gg/ml) and the cell suspension was subjected to FACS (FACScan, Becton-Dickinson) to
determine the fraction of cells in Go/G 1, S and G2/M phases. Peak deconvolution was performed
using ModFit LT V2.0 for Macintosh.
For histological evaluation, constructs were paraffin embedded, bisected and cross-sectioned
(5 m thick) and either stained with hematoxylin and eosin or immunostained as previously
55
described [11] with monoclonal antibodies for sarcomeric a actin (diluted 1:500, Sigma), cardiac
troponin I (diluted 1:150, Biodesign) or sarcomeric tropomyosin (diluted 1 :100, Sigma).
The contractile function of engineered cardiac constructs was evaluated by monitoring
contractile activity upon electrical stimulation at 10X magnification using a microscope (Nikon
Diaphot). Each constructs was placed in a 100 mm Petri dish containing of 120 ml Tyrode's
solution (140 mM NaCI, 5.4 mM KCI, 0.33 mM NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCI2, mM MgCI2, 5 mM
HEPES, 5.5 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4) between two custom made gold electrodes connected to a
cardiac stimulator (Nihon Kohden). The temperature was maintained at 37Â°C using a heating tape
(VWR) attached to the bottom of the Petri dish. The stimuli (square pulses, 2 ms duration) were
applied at a rate of 60 bpm starting at an amplitude of V that was gradually increased at 0.1 V
increments until the excitation threshold (ET) was reached and the entire construct was observed
to beat synchronously.
The maximum capture rate (MCR) was defined as the maximum pacing frequency (bpm) for
a synchronous stimulus-response of the constructs. To measure MCR, the stimulation frequency
was increased (from 60 to 600 bpm, in 20 bpm increments) at a constant voltage (equal to either
150% or 200% of the ET). The construct response was measured at each frequency and the
frequency was increased until the contractions became asynchronous, irregular or completely
ceased. The maximum frequency for synchronous contractions was recorded as the MCR. The
value of ET, which was different from one construct to another due to the differences in their
structures, served as a baseline voltage for the measurement of MCR. One example of the
recording sequence is shown in Radisic_video_3 (supplemental information).
Constructs cultured in perfused cartridges were compared to constructs cultured in mixed
dishes and to neonatal rat ventricles (full thickness slices obtained by bisecting the left ventricle
parallel to the base apex line). The effect of palmitoleic acid (PA), a gap-junction blocker [20],
was investigated by incubating constructs or slices of native ventricles in PA (8.3 mM in
Tyrode's solution) for 20 min at 37 Â°C and then determining ET and MCR as described above. To
test if the effect of PA was reversible, constructs were transferred to Tyrode's solution and re-
tested after an additional 20 min at 37Â°C.
Statistical analysis: Individual and interactive effects of culture system and time were
determined using the two-way ANOVA (SgimaStat). Culture system was investigated at two
levels (orbital shaker at 25 rpm; perfusion 0.5 mU/min), the effect of time was investigated at three
levels (1.5 hr, I day and 7 days) in respect to live cell number, cell viability, glucose consumption
rate and molar ratio of lactate produced to glucose consumed. For cell cycle fractions, the effect
of time was investigated at two levels ( day and 7 days). All experimental data passed normality
56
and equal variance tests. For pairwise comparisons we chose the most conservative Tukey's post
hoc test with P < 0.05 considered as significant.
RESULTS
Cell number and viability Cell survival was consistent with the conditions of flow in each
experimental group. Flow visualization demonstrated that the central 5 mm diameter region of the
perfused constructs had uniform interstitial flow, whereas the outer-edge ring between the two
gaskets was shielded from flow (Figure 4. 1). In orbitally mixed dishes, fluid flow was generated
at construct surfaces, but not in their interiors.
The effects of culture system and time of culture on cell survival and function are shown in
Figure 4.2; the corresponding statistical data are shown in Table 4.1.

grown constructs. (#) significant difference between I or 7-day and 1.5 hr constructs; (&) significant
difference between 7-day and I day constructs.
In seeded constructs (1.5 h time point), the live cell numbers were comparable for perfused
and control constructs (approximately 7 million cells per construct in both groups, Figure 4.2A).
Throughout the cultivation (1 day and 7 day time points), the number of live cells in perfused
constructs was significantly higher than in dish-grown constructs (Figure 4.2A). Notably, the
number of live cells in dish-grown constructs decreased rapidly during the first day of culture and
58L ...
continued to decrease relatively slowly between day 1 nd day 7. In contrast, live cell numbers in
perfused constructs did not change from 1.5 h to day I and decreased slowly over the time of
culture. The volume fraction of the construct that was adequately perfused corresponds roughly to
the fraction of cells that remained viable over 7 days of culture (Figure 4.2 A). Cell viability was
significantly higher in perfused than in dish-grown constructs at all time points (Figure 4.2B).
Importantly, the final cell viability in perfused constructs (81.6 Â± 3.7%, Figure 4.2 B) was not
significantly different than the viability of the freshly isolated cells (83.8 2.0) and it was
markedly and significantly higher than the cell viability in dish-grown constructs (47.4 + 7.8 %,
Figure 4.2 B). The overall level of cell damage and death was assessed by monitoring the levels
of LDH activity in the culture medium. At all time points tested (1,3 7 days) the levels of LDH
were significantly lower in perfusion compared to the orbitally mixed dish (Figure 4.2E)
indicating less cell damage and death.
Cell Metabolism The oxygen tension in culture medium (O2) was significantly higher at the
inlet of perfusion cartridges than in orbitally mixed dishes (145 i 1 vs. 135 Â± 1 mm Hg,, p < 0.05
n = 5-8). The measured decrease in oxygen tension across the perfused cartridge was only 8 mm
Hg, suggesting that culture medium rich in oxygen was available to the cells throughout the
construct volume. In contrast, culture medium rich in oxygen was available only to the cells at
surfaces of dish-grown constructs. The molar ratio of lactate produced to glucose consumed (L/G)
was -I for perfused constructs throughout the duration of culture, indicating aerobic cell
metabolism (Figure 4.2C). In contrast, L/G increased progressively from I to 2 with time of
culture for dish-grown constructs, indicating a transient to anaerobic cell metabolism. (Figure
4.2C). The increase in L/G with time in dish cultures was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The
consumption rate of glucose, the primary energy source in our system, per unit live cells was not
significantly different between the groups at any time point. It decreased after seeding to the
values that were comparable at I day and 7 days of cultivation and consistent with previously
published data [21] (Figure 4.2D).
Individual and interactive effects of culture system and culture time on cell viability and
metabolic function. Importantly, both the culture system (perfusion or orbital dish) and the time
of culture (1.5 h; 1 day; 7 days) had statistically significant individual effects on the cell survival
parameters shown in Figure 4.2 (live cell number, cell viability, L/G, glucose consumption).
Culture system alone had significant effect on the levels of LDH in culture medium. For cell
viability and L/G, we detected additional interactive effects of culture system and culture time
(Table 4.1).

(time 0 in Figure 4.3 A and B) were maintained throughout the duration of culture in perfused
but not in dish-grown constructs. Cells isolated from perfused constructs and freshly isolated
cardiomyocytes had more cells in the S phase than in the G2/M phases, whereas cells isolated

higher in perfused than in dish-grown constructs (Figure 4.3). Statistical analysis demonstrated
significant effects of culture system on fractions of cells in the S phase (p = 0.005) and G2/M
phase (p = 0.01), and culture time on the fraction of cells in the G0/G I phase (p = 0.018).

diffusion in the interiors of dish-grown constructs supported only low density of scattered cells
(Figure 4.4 B).
Sarcomeric a-actin, cardiac troponin I and sarcomeric tropomyosin were present throughout
the perfused construct volume (Figure 4.5 A, B). In contrast, dish-grown constructs exhibited
spatially non-uniform cell distributions, with most cells expressing contractile proteins located
within a 100-300 gm thick surface layer, and only a small number of viable differentiated cells in
the construct interior (Figure 4.5A, B). Constructs from both groups consisted mainly of
mononucleated cells, and exhibited the lack of well established structural alignment of the
contractile proteins that was observed in native tissue. The central perfused regions of the
constructs (5 mm diameter x 1.5 mm thick) consisted of tightly packed cells expressing
sarcomeric a-actin, cardiac troponin I and sarcomeric tropomyosin, similar to neonatal rat
ventricles, and distinctly different from the tissue present in the centers of dish-grown constructs
(5 mm dia x 1.5 mm thick) that contained only isolated and poorly differentiated cells (Figure
4.5B).
Contractile behavior Spontaneous contractions were observed in some constructs early in
culture (dish-grown constructs 2 -3 days after seeding), and ceased after approximately 5 days of
cultivation. At the end of cultivation (day 7), spontaneous contractions were not observed in
either group of constructs. In response to electrical stimulation (e.g., at 5V and 60 bpm),
constructs from both groups were reproducibly induced to contract synchronously (please see
Radisicvideo_1 and Radisicvideo_2). However, in perfused constructs the contraction
frequency was constant, whereas in dish-grown constructs the contraction frequency
spontaneously increased every I -2 min and the contraction pattern appeared arrhythmic. The
excitation threshold (ET) was significantly lower in perfused than in dish-grown constructs, and
all construct ETs were significantly higher than those measured for neonatal rat ventricles. There
was no significant difference in the maximum capture rates (MCR) measured for the two groups
at supra-threshold stimulus amplitudes (150% and 200% of ET, Table 4. 2).

Upon incubation with palmitoleic acid (PA), a gap junctional blocker, synchronous

the washout of PA. The maximum capture rates (MCRs) of perfused constructs and neonatal
ventricles were similar to those recorded before the PA treatment, suggesting that the effect of PA
was completely reversible. However, the MCRs of dish-grown constructs failed to recover their
baseline levels after PA wash-out (Table 4.2).
DISCUSSION
Tissue engineered grafts for the repair of impaired myocardium should ideally meet the
following requirements: (a) sufficient size and thickness to allow for the repair of infarcted areas
or congenital malformations, (b) spatially uniform and physiologic density of viable,
metabolically active cells (-108cells/cm3), (c) presence of contractile proteins and other cardiac
64
markers of cell differentiation, (d) functional coupling resulting in synchronous macroscopic
contraction in response to stimuli, and (e) mechanical integrity to allow for surgical implantation.
Previous studies of engineered cardiac tissue have demonstrated cell coupling and differentiation
[13, 15], mechanical and electrophysiological function [12, 15]. Implantation of engineered
constructs has been studied in small animal models [4, 6, 14, 22]. One overwhelming limitation
of all previous studies, the small thickness of viable and functional engineered tissue (100 -200
gm), was attributed to the diffusional transport limitations of oxygen supply [17, 18] and the need
to utilize perfusion as a potential means to overcome this limitation has been recognized [4].
Medium perfusion was used in our previous studies to culture cardiac constructs seeded in
orbitally mixed dishes [17, 18]. Perfusion resulted in spatially uniform cell distributions, but the
constructs cell densities remained low due to diffusional limitations of oxygen supply during cell
seeding [17, 18]. In particular, our previous seeding techniques required a 72-hr period during
which only the cells in surface regions of the construct remained viable; perfusion during
cultivation redistributed viable cells throughout the entire construct volume.
We subsequently showed that rapid cell inoculation using MatrigelÂ® in combination with the
immediate establishment of medium perfusion shortened the seeding period from 72 hr to 10 min.
[10]. This technique helped overcome the diffusional limitations of oxygen transport to the cells
during seeing and resulted in constructs with physiologic densities of viable cells [10].
We hypothesized that the formation of compact, contractile cardiac tissue can be achieved by
providing convective-diffusive oxygen transport during construct cultivation. The flow
configuration in perfused constructs (Figure 4.1A, inset) does not provide a separate
compartment for medium flow that would correspond to the capillary space and may therefore
induce hydrodynamic cell damage. However, the exchange of oxygen, nutrients and metabolites
occurs by the combination of convection through the tissue phase and diffusion over short
distances, in a manner resembling some aspects of mass transport in vivo. Using this approach,
we cultivated cardiac constructs with a perfused central area (5 mm diameter x 1.5 mm thick) that
was compact and consisted of highly viable (-85%) cells expressing sarcomeric a-actin, cardiac
troponin I and sarcomeric tropomyosin (Figure 4.4A), and contracted synchronously at a constant
frequency in response to electrical stimulation (Table 4.2). These perfused regions could
potentially be utilized as a patch for myocardium repair or studies of tissue function in vitro.
One of the most important results of this study is that the culture system (S: perfusion or
orbitally mixed dishes) and the time of culture (T: 1.5 hr; day; 7 days) had statistically
significant effects on the number of live cells (Figure 4.2A), cell viability (Figure 4.2B), lactate
yield on glucose (L/G) (Figure 4.2C), glucose consumption (Figure 4.2D) and medium LDH
65
(Figure 4.2E) in engineered constructs. S and T also affected in a statistically significant manner
the number of cells in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Figure 4.3). Additional
interactive effects of culture system and culture time on cell viability and L/G were also detected
(Table 4.1). Notably, perfusion improved all parameters that determine cell survival and function
in engineered constructs at all times during the cultivation (Figures 4.2 and 4.3), presumably due
to the convective-diffusive transport of oxygen, as compared to oxygen diffusion within dish-
grown constructs.
Although constructs cultivated in perfusion contained significantly more live cells after and
7 days in culture (Figure 4.2A), the live cell numbers decreased with time in both systems. The
initial decrease in live cell numbers observed 1.5 hr after seeding (Figure 4.2A) can be attributed
to the insufficient oxygen supply to the cells in the peripheral region shielded from fluid flow in
perfused constructs (Figure 4.1A, inset) and in the interior of dish-grown constructs. Poor
oxygenation of the outer edge of the perfused constructs is consistent with the finding that the
volume fraction of the construct that was adequately perfused corresponds roughly to the fraction
of surviving cells (live cell number/seeded cell number) after 7 days of cultivation (Figure 4.2A).
The perfused volume fraction (and thereby the fraction of surviving cells) would increase for
thinner silicone gaskets and larger diameter scaffolds. Rather slow decrease of live cell numbers
in perfused constructs between and 7 days (Figure 4.2A), in conjunction with the maintenance
of cell viability (Figure. 4.2B) and aerobic cell metabolism during the entire cultivation period
(L/G -1, Figure 4.2C), suggests that mechanisms other than diffusional limitations of oxygen
supply are responsible for the decrease in live cell number in perfused constructs. Relatively low
cell viability and live cell numbers in dish-grown constructs (Figure 4.2B, Figure 4.2A) are
consistent with the prevalently anaerobic cell metabolism (Figure 4.2C) resulting from
diffusional transport of oxygen. As a result, a "viable shell" formed at the construct surface
within 1.5 h of cell seeding. Approximately constant cell viability in this shell is also consistent
with the diffusional limitations of oxygen transport from the construct surface into the interior.
High cell viability is essential for the use of engineered constructs as tissue models for
controlled in vitro studies (e.g., cell function, tissue development), as well as for the envisioned in
vivo applications. Cell viability was significantly higher in perfusion than in orbitally mixed
dishes at all time points (Figure 4.2B). A transient decrease in cell viability after day in culture
in perfusion is consistent with the washout of dead cells from the perfused constructs. If not
removed promptly from the tissue construct, cells that die by necrosis swell and burst, releasing
their intracellular contents, which can damage surrounding cells [23]. In vivo, the intracellular
contents of the cells that die by apoptosis are cleared by phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies, the
66
process usually carried out by macrophages. In the lack of efficient clearance, the apoptotic
bodies undergo a process called secondary apoptosis and release the lysosomal content into the
environment. [24, 25]. In our in vitro system there are no efficient cellular means of clearing the
apoptotic bodies. Even fibroblasts which have some phagocytic ability were demonstrated to
undergo secondary apoptosis in vitro [26]. Importantly, improper removal of apoptotic cells in
vivo had been associated with a number of pathological states e.g osteoarthritis [27], lupus
erythematosus [28] and cystic fibrosis [29-31]. Therefore, the perfusion of medium provides
means for the washout of apoptotic and necrotic cells, thereby minimizing the presence of their
intracellular contents within the tissue constructs.
As an independent measure of the cell damage and death, we monitored the level of LDH in
the culture medium in both systems, ensuring that both cells contained within the tissue construct
and cells present in culture medium were accounted for in both groups. The LDH assay has been
used to complement cell viability determined by membrane exclusion dyes (e.g propidium iodide
[32, 33] or calcein AM [34]). Since LDH is an intracellular enzyme, its presence in the culture
medium is indicative of irreversible cell damage and correlates with decreases in cell viability and
live cell numbers. Significantly lower levels of LDH in perfusion compared to the orbitally mixed
dishes at all time points thus indicated that perfusion reduced the level of cell damage. The slow
increase in the LDH levels (Figure 4.2E) in orbital dishes parallels the increase in L/G (Figure
4.2C), while the constant levels of LDH in perfusion parallel relatively constant L/G, a
relationship that has previously been demonstrated for the LDH and lactate output [35, 36].
There was no apparent difference in the rate of glucose consumption per unit live cells
between dish-grown and perfused constructs, although the live cell numbers differed by a factor
of two (Figure 4.2D), a result consistent with the fact that anaerobic metabolism yields twice as
much lactate per unit glucose as aerobic metabolism. The rate of glucose consumption exhibited a
transiently high value 1.5 hr after seeding, and then decreased to a constant value consistent with
the reported data for glucose consumption in the absence of fatty acids [21].
The maintenance of the relative fractions of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle at
levels determined for the initial cell population in perfused but not in dish-grown constructs is
likely to be due to the better control of cellular environment. Cell cycle analysis revealed a
proliferative compartment in both groups of constructs (Figure 4.3), indicating that the measured
live cell number resulted from a balance of cell death and proliferation in the population of
cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts used to seed the scaffolds. The higher number of live cells in
perfused than dish-grown constructs (Figure 4.2A) is consistent with the higher fraction of cells
67
in the S phase. Importantly, the presence of fibroblasts can improve mechanical properties of
engineered cardiac tissue [15].
The spatial uniformity of sarcomeric a actin, cardiac troponin I and tropomyosin that was
highest in neonatal rat ventricles and higher in the perfused than in dish-grown constructs (Figure
4.4 and 4.5) was consistent with the respective differences in the modes of oxygen transport in
vivo and in vitro. In a native rat heart, oxygen is supplied through the capillary network and the
total oxygen content is increased by the carrier protein hemoglobin, supporting cell respiration in
a thick compact tissue. In perfused cartridges, culture medium flows through the constructs at an
average velocity comparable to that found in the native capillary network (- 500 m/s), and
thereby supports a high density of viable cells throughout the entire volume of the construct. In
dishes, the absence of fluid flow within the constructs leads to formation of a 100 -200 gm thick
outer layer of tissue that receives oxygen by diffusion from the construct surfaces.
The level of structural alignment of contractile proteins, that was subnormal in both groups of
engineered constructs, can potentially be improved by utilization of physical forces (e.g
mechanical stimulation, [15]. Therefore, the perfusion system that maintains cell viability,
aerobic metabolism and uniform distribution, could be further improved by addition of defined
physical forces. An ideal system would likely include the interstitial medium flow through the
construct along with mechanical and/or electrical signals.
The excitation threshold for synchronous macroscopic contractions, which was the lowest for
neonatal rat ventricle and the highest for constructs cultivated in orbitally mixed dishes, is
consistent with observed differences in tissue architecture. In perfused constructs, with regions of
densely packed cells distributed throughout the construct volume, ETs were lower than in dish-
grown constructs where densely packed cells were present only at construct surfaces. MCR was
measured at 150 and 200% ET in order to take into account cell regions that were poorly
connected to the cell network and may have higher ET. Comparable MCRs measured at 150%
and 200% of ET indicate that the cell network was established in both groups without large
unconnected regions, at least in the surface region. However, the measured electrical properties
are not necessarily a predictor of wave propagation in engineered constructs. Wave propagation
studies will be needed to further characterize the spatial homogeneity of functional cell coupling.
As expected, the addition of PA resulted in cessation of contractile activity, indicating that
signal propagation through the gap junctions was crucial for synchronous macroscopic
contractions. The effect of gap-junctional blocker on ET and MCR was completely reversible in
neonatal rat ventricles and perfused constructs, but not in dish-grown constructs (Table 4.1),
68
suggesting that the level of organization of the tissue architecture and the robustness of cell
response were different in the two groups.
Tissue constructs cultivated in perfusion may be utilized for in vitro testing to optimize the
methods of cultivation and generate constructs capable of implantation. Although perfused
constructs meet most of the requirements necessary for the in vivo implantation (e.g size, cell
uniformity, viability, contractility and metabolic activity) some requirements are yet to be
achieved (e.g modulation of cell morphology). Several previous studies have shown the
feasibility of implanting polymers seeded with cardiac or stem cells (15, 16, 20, 22). Cell survival
following implantation likely depends on oxygen supply into the construct interior throughout the
period needed for the development of functional capillary network and construct integration with
the host myocardium. We therefore envision the use of constructs with an array of channels that
will be implanted parallel to the epicardial surface (to reduce diffusional distances for mass
transport and provide space for in-growth of new blood vessels). To further enhance angiogenesis
and vasculogenesis, constructs can be implanted under a membrane containing a vehicle for
VEGF release. Together, the use of channeled constructs and transplantation techniques that
promote oxygen supply to the cells and the in-growth of new blood vessels are expected to result
in improved cell survival and implant function as compared to previously published methods.
In conclusion, interstitial flow of culture medium yielded thick, compact and contractile
cardiac constructs containing physiologic densities of metabolically active and viable cells
expressing cardiac markers. The maintenance of oxygen supply to the cells throughout the
duration of in vitro cultivation was key for maintaining cell viability and function. These
constructs might potentially be used for myocardium repair or studies of normal and pathological
tissue function in vitro.

5.THE ROLE OF ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF CONTRACTILITY IN
FUNCTIONAL ASSEMBLY OF MYOCARDIUM IN VITRO
INTRODUCTION:
Nearly 8 million people in the United States alone have suffered from myocardial infarction,
with 800,000 new cases occurring each year [1]. Conventional therapies are limited by the
inability of myocardium to regenerate after injury [2] and the shortage of organs available for
transplantation. Cell based therapies have been considered as a novel and potentially curative
treatment option [3], either by utilization of cells alone [4-16]or by tissue engineering of cardiac
grafts in vitro that can be surgically attached to the myocardium [17-31].
In standard culture systems (dishes, flasks, rotating vessels), cardiomyocytes did not align in
parallel as in the native heart and they remained poorly differentiated most likely due to the lack
of orderly externally imposed excitation-contraction coupling [ 18, 19]. Application of contraction
alone via cyclic mechanical stretch significantly improved the level of cell differentiation and
force of contraction, but some hallmarks of cardiac differentiation were still missing (M bands, IC
discs) [30]. In addition, the distribution and frequency of gap junctions, critical for electrical
signal propagation in the tissue, remained unclear. Notably, orderly coupling between electrical
excitation and contractions, which is crucial for the development and function of native
myocardium [32], has not been established in any of these culture systems.
We hypothesized that the excitation-contraction coupling of cardiac constructs cultured in
vitro will enhance the level of differentiation and functional assembly of engineered tissue via
physiologically relevant mechanisms. We report the development of a biomimetic system in
which cardiac constructs are stimulated to contract synchronously during culture in response to a
pulsatile electric field. The supra-threshold electrical signals resulted in concurrent development
of conductive and contractile properties of engineered cardiac constructs in just 8 days of culture,
with strong dependence on the initiation and duration of the applied stimulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Cell isolation: Cardiomyocytes were obtained from -2 day old neonatal Sprague
Dawley (Charles River) rats according to procedures approved by the Institute's Committee on
Animal Care, as previously described [18]. In brief, ventricles were quartered, incubated
overnight at 4Â°C in a 0.06 % (w/v) solution of trypsin in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS,
Gibco), washed in culture medium, and subjected to a series of digestions (3 min, 37Â°C, 150 rpm)
in a 0.1 % (w/v) solution of collagenase type II in HBSS. The first digestate was discarded, and
72
the cell suspensions from the subsequent 4 -6 digestions were centrifuged (750 rpm, 4 min),
resuspended in HBSS each, pooled, and resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium
(DMEM, Gibco) containing 4.5 g/L glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM
L-glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were pre-plated for one 60 min period to enrich for
cardiomyocytes (i.e. cells that remained unattached were used to prepare constructs).
Construct preparation: UltrafoaTM (Davol) collagen sponge scaffolds (8 x 6 x .5mm)
were preweted with culture medium and placed into the 37Â°C 5%C02 humidified incubator
(Napco, Winchester, VA) for one hour before inoculation. Cells (6-106) were pelleted by
centrifugation (1000 rpm, 10 min) and resuspended in MatrigelÂ® (30g1, Becton-Dickinson),
while working on ice to prevent premature gelation. Pre-wetted scaffolds were gently blotted dry,
placed in six well plates (1/well) and the MatrigelÂ®/cell suspension was delivered evenly to the
top surface of each scaffold using an automatic pipette. Gelation was achieved within 15 min at
37Â°C. Subsequently, culture medium was added (4ml/well) and the plates were orbitally mixed
(25 rpm) for 3 days.
Electrical stimulation: After 1, 3 or 5 days of cultivation without electrical stimulation,
the constructs were transferred to a chamber consisting of a 100 mm glass dish fitted with two 1/4Â¼"
diameter carbon rods (Ladd Research Industries) placed at a distance of cm and connected to a
commercial cardiac stimulator (Nihon Kohden) via platinum wires (Ladd Research Industries).
Silicone tubing (Cole-Parmer) spacers were used to create six wells between the two electrodes,
enabling the cultivation of six constructs per dish. In one group (designated "stimulated"), the
constructs were stimulated with square pulses, 2 ms in duration, supra-threshold amplitude of 5 V
(field strength of 5V/cm), frequency of I Hz for the remainder of cultivation (up to 8 days). The
stimulation voltage was adjusted to the minimum required to induce synchronous construct
contractions (observable with optical microscope at lOx magnification). Construct placed in an
identical chamber but without electrical stimulation served as control (designated "non-
stimulated"). All chambers were orbitally mixed at 25 rpm. Experiments were performed in a
37Â°C / 5% CO2humidified incubator. Total of 130 constructs were prepared in 5 independent
experiments that utilized a total of 10 rat litters.
Metabolic parameters: Medium samples were taken at days 3, 5 and 8 of tissue culture
and evaluated for glucose, lactate using a glucose and L-lactate analyzer Model 2300 STAT plus
(Yellow Spring Instrument) and for lactate dehydrogenase levels (LDH) using a commercially
available kit (LDH-L, Chiron Diagnostics, [19]).
DNA and total protein: Samples for DNA and total protein were taken at the beginning
of electrical stimulation (day 1, 3 or 5) and at the end of cultivation period (Day 8) and frozen in
73
liquid nitrogen. They were homogenized in a buffer (N NH4OH, 2% Triton X-100) by Mini-
bead beater (Biospec Products) with 6 cycles 10s cycles at 25 rpm. After centrifugation for 10
minutes at 12,000 g at 4Â°C, the homogenates were stored at -80Â°C until further analysis. For DNA
assay, the homogenate was incubated at 37Â°C for 10 min and then diluted with 10 mM Tris-l mM
EDTA buffer containing 100 mM NaCI (1:20). After centrifugation (2,500g for 30 min), the
supernatant was collected to measure DNA content fluorometrically by Hoescht dye binding [19].
Total protein was measured by a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad) as previously described
([18, 19]).
Western blots: Samples for Western blot were taken as described above for biochemical
assays. Construct homogenates were diluted (1:2) in Laemni buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5%
mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS and boiled for 5 minutes to denature proteins. They were separated
on 12% Tris-glycine minigels (Bio-Rad) using kaleidoscope-prestained standards (Bio-Rad) at a
constant voltage (100 V, 2 hours, room temperature). Three constructs from each group and time
point were analyzed to compare the expression of the protein bands, and each lane was loaded
with the same amount of protein (20 g). Eluted proteins were electroblotted in Ix
Tris/Glycine/SDS running buffer (Bio-Rad) onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad)
at 100 V for 60 minutes at room temperature in the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot cell. Blots were first
incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1 % Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T) at room temperature for I
hour to block non-specific binding and then, for an additional hr at 50rpm, with the appropriate
primary antibody: (1) rabbit anti-connexin 43 (Cx-43) (Chemicon), diluted 1:10 in PBS-T; (2)
goat anti-creatin kinase-MM (CK-MM) (Biodesign), diluted 1:3,000 in PBS-T; (3) mouse anti-
troponin I (Tnl) (Biodesign), diluted 1:3,000 in PBS-T; (4) mouse anti-a-myosin heavy
chain(MHC) (ATCC hybridoma supernatant); and (5) mouse anti-3-MHC (Chemicon), diluted
1:50 in PBS-T. Blots were washed five times with PBS-T and incubated for hour at room
temperature with rabbit anti-goat, rabbit anti-mouse, or sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Sigma),
respectively, all conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted 1:10,000 in PBS-T. After five
additional washes, the immunocomplexes were developed using enhanced horseradish
peroxidase-luminol chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham)
and detected after exposure to photographic film (Hyperfilm-ECL) for 5-30 seconds. Band
intensity was quantified by image analysis (Scion Image software).
RT-PCR: RNA from the constructs sampled (n=3 per group, at day 3 and day 8 of
cultivation) was extracted using Trizol reagent (GibcoBRL) and RNeasyÂ® mini kit (Qiagen) following
manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, constructs in Trizol were disintegrated using a steel-ball bead
beater (6 cycles of 10 seconds each at 25 rpm). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at
74
14,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Total RNA was collected by RNA column chromatography using water
as eluant. RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm by a UV
spectrophotometr.. One step RT-PCR was carried according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen).
Total RNA (0.5-0.05 Ig) was used with specific primers and the RT-PCR reactions were performed
at 50Â°C for 30 minutes, 95Â°C for 15 minutes, 94Â°C for I minute (23 cycles), 60Â°C for 1 minute, 72Â°C
for 1.5 minutes, and at 72Â°C for 10 minutes. The following primers were used in PCR reactions:

Histology and immunohistochemistry: Constructs were sampled at day 3 and day 8,
rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6-12 hrs. Samples
were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)
for general evaluation. Staining for cardiac troponin , sarcomeric a-actin, a-myosin heavy chain
(a-MHC), 1-myosin heavy chain (-MHC) and connexin-43 in n=4-6 samples per group and
time point was used to assess the distributions of cardiac myocytes and tissue organization.
For immunohistochemical staining, cardiac tissue sections were depariffinized and
antigen was retrieved by heat treatment for 20 min at 95Â°C in declocking chamber (Biocare
Medical). Subsequently, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation in 0.3%
hydrogen peroxide (VWR) for 30 min at room temperature, the sections were then blocked with
10% horse serum (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature, then incubated for 
hour at 37Â°C with mouse anti-cardiac troponin I (Biodesign) and mouse anti-sarcomeric ca-actin
(Sigma) monoclonal antibodies diluted 1:150 and 1:500, respectively in PBS containing 0.5%
75
Tween 20 (Sigma) and 1.5% horse serum. Subsequently, sections were incubated for 30 min at
room temperature with a secondary antibody (horse anti-mouse IgG, Standard Elite ABC kit,
Vector Laboratories), diluted 1:200, and then with an avidin-biotin complex agent for 30 min at
room temperature and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) for 15 min at RT. A humidified chamber
was used for all incubation steps. Sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma-
Aldrich) and cover-slipped using xylene-based mounting media (Cytoseal). Sections of neonatal
rat heart ventricles and bovine tendons served as positive and negative controls, respectively.
Controls were prepared using the same methods, and in the same batch with engineered
constructs. Tissue architecture was assessed from stained tissue sections using videomicroscopy
and Scion Image software.
For immunofluorescence, sections were deparaffminized and antigen was retrieved by heat
treatment for 20 min at 95Â°C in decloacking chamber (Biocare Medical), blocked with 10% horse
serum (Vector Laboratories) for 40 min at room temperature, then incubated for hour at 37Â°C
with primary antibodies: mouse anti-a-myosin heavy chain (hybridoma supernatant, ATCC, full
strength), mouse anti-5-myosin heavy chain (Chemicon, full strength) and rabbit anti-Connexin-
43 (Chemicon, 1:50) diluted in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 1.5% horse serum.
Subsequently, the sections were incubated with the following secondary antibodies (all from
Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at 37Â°C: Texas Red conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:100) for
a-MHC visualization, fluorescein conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100) for f3-MHC visualization,
and fluorescein conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for Cx-43 visualization. The sections
were counterstained with DAPI and cover-slipped (Vectorshield mounting medium with DAPI).
Neonatal rat ventricles and bovine articulate cartilage served as positive control and negative
control, respectively. Construct architecture and cell distribution were assessed from tissue
sections using a fluorescent microscope (Axioplan, Zeiss) and Open Lab software.
Transmission Electron Microscopy: Constructs (n=6 per group and time point) were
taken at day 3 and day 8 and fixed in Karnovsky's reagent (0.1 M sodium cacodylate with 2%
paraformaldehyde and 2.5% gluteraldehyde, pH = 7.4), post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in
veronal-acetate buffer, dehydrated in graded ethanol in propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon
812 (Polysciences). Sections (70 nm thick) were prepared using a Leica Ultra Cut and a diamond
knife, stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and examined using a Philips EM410
transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV (JEOL- 100CX, JEOL).
Morphometric analysis: Morphometric analysis was performed on 20-46 randomly taken
transmission electron micrographs at magnification of 100,000. A test grid with uniform squares
(0.26 cm x 0.26 cm) was superimposed onto the micrographs and the area covered by sarcomeres,
76
mithochondria, nuclei and the overall area of the cells were determined. The volume fraction of
each organelle was determined as previously described {Loud, 1984 #2023. The frequency of
intercalated discs and gap junctions (number per gm2) was determined by counting. A total of 20
micrographs of non-stimulated constructs, 46 micrographs of stimulated constructs and 42
micrographs of neonatal heart ventricles were evaluated with respect to each structural parameters
by two independent observers.
Contractile response: The contractile function of engineered cardiac constructs was
evaluated by monitoring contractile activity upon electrical stimulation at lo0X magnification
using a microscope (Nikon Diaphot). Each construct that was evaluated was placed in a 100 mm
Petri dish containing 120 ml of Tyrode's solution (140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCI, 0.33 mM
NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCI2, mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4) between two
custom made gold electrodes connected to a cardiac stimulator (Nihon Kohden). The temperature
was maintained at 37Â°C using a heating tape (VWR) attached to the bottom of the Petri dish. The
stimuli (square pulses, 2 ms duration) were applied at a rate of 60 bpm starting at the amplitude of
I V. The amplitude was increased in 0.1V increments, until the entire construct was observed to
beat synchronously, a voltage defined as the excitation threshold (ET). Maximum capture rate
(MCR) was determined at 200 % of ET by increasing the stimulation frequency in 50bpm
increments, until the paced contractions became irregular or completely ceased. To measure the
amplitude of contractions, video recorded beating sequences (1-5 min in duration) were digitized
at the rate of 30 frames/s. The en-face area of each construct was measured as function of time
using image analysis (Scion Image software). Amplitude of contraction was expressed as
fractional area change.
Electrical activity: Electrical activity was recorded for stimulated constructs at the end of
cultivation using a platinum electrode positioned 2mm away from the pair of stimulating
electrodes (carbon rods). Conventional cardiac stimulator (Nihon Kohden) was used to apply
square biphasic pulses 2ms duration and 5V at Hz.
Statistical analysis: Differences between the experimental groups were analyzed using
Tukey's test followed by one way ANOVA for pairwise comparisons or Dunn's test; p<0.05 was
considered significant. Unless otherwise noted, all data are expressed as average+standard error.
RESULTS:
Stimulated constructs had significantly stronger contractile responses to pacing as compared
to non-stimulated controls (video clips). For constructs stimulated from day 3 to day 8 of culture,
77
the amplitude of synchronous contractions was 7-fold higher than for otherwise identical non-
stimulated constructs (Figure 5.1a). Importantly, the contractile behavior progressively
developed with time (Figure 5.1lb).
Excitation threshold (ET), defined as the minimum stimulation voltage amplitude at Hz for
which the entire construct was observed to beat synchronously, decreased with time of culture
toward values that were measured for native heart (Figure 5.1c). The maximum capture rate
(MCR), defined as the maximum pacing frequency for synchronous construct contractions at 150
% ET, increased with the duration of electrical stimulation. Consistently, the MCR of stimulated
8-day constructs was markedly and significantly higher than the MCR of either non-stimulated or
early (3-day) constructs (Figure 5.1d). The shape, amplitude (-100 mV) and duration (-200 ms)
of trans-membrane potentials recorded for cells in constructs that were electrically stimulated
during culture (Figure 5.1e) were similar to the action potentials reported for cells from
constructs that were mechanically stimulated during culture {Zimmermann, 2002 # 125}.
Expression of genes for sarcomeric a-actin, a-MHC, 5-MHC, connexin -43 and P3-integrin
was confirmed for all groups at all time points (Figure 5.5). Stimulated constructs exhibited
higher levels of a-myosin heavy chain (MHC), connexin 43, creatin kinase-MM and troponin I
relatively to either non-stimulated 8-day constructs or to early (3-day) constructs (Figure 5.1f)0.
Comparable levels of mRNA in all groups (Figure 5), but different relative protein levels are
consistent with translational regulation as reported [33]. The ratio of a-MHC (adult) and P-MHC
(neonatal) isoforms (-1.5 in 3 day constructs), decreased to 1.4 in non-stimulated group at the end
of cultivation period, and increased to 1.8 in the stimulated group, suggesting that electrical
stimulation enhanced the differentiation and maturation of cardiomyocytes (Figure g).

Notably, improved contractile properties were not the result of differences in construct
cellularity or cell metabolism (Table 5.1), but rather due to the improved cell morphology,
alignment, and structural organization of the conductive and contractile apparatus. No significant
differences were found between the non-stimulated and stimulated constructs with respect to
glucose metabolism, cell damage (release of lactate dehydrogenase) and cellularity (mg DNA/g
wet weight)(Table 5.1). The lack of pathological cell hypertrophy in electrically stimulated
engineered cardiac tissue was evidenced by the lack of ANF expression and comparable contents
of RNA and DNA per wet weight. (Table 5.1).

At the ultrastructural level, stimulated constructs demonstrated a remarkable level of
differentiation, comparable to that of native myocardium. Cells were aligned and elongated, and
contained centrally positioned elongated nuclei, similar to native myocardium and in contrast to
the non-stimulated constructs that consisted of round, disorganized cells (Figure 5.3a) with high
81
nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. Cells in stimulated constructs and neonatal rat ventricles contained
abundant mitochondria positioned between myofibrils; in non-stimulated constructs,
mitochondria were scattered around the cytoplasm (Figure 5.3b). Morphometric analysis
documented that the volume fractions occupied by nuclei and mitochondria decreased and
increased, respectively, in a statistically significant manner from non-stimulated to stimulated
constructs to neonatal heart ventricles (Figure 5.3f). In addition, substantially larger amounts of
glycogen were present in stimulated constructs and neonatal rat ventricles than in non-stimulated
constructs. Electrical stimulation of contractility induced the development of long, well aligned
registers of sarcomeres containing compact and clearly visible M, Z lines, H, I and A bands
closely resembling those in native myocardium (Figure 5.3 b, c). The development of in-register
sarcomeres that resulted from the application of supra-threshold electrical stimulation is a
hallmark of maturing cardiomyocytes [32].
The volume fraction of sarcomeres in stimulated 8-day constructs was comparable to that
measured for a neonatal rat ventricle by us and others [34]in contrast to non-stimulated constructs
that contained only scattered and poorly organized sarcomeres (Figure 5.3h). In stimulated
samples, intercalated discs were positioned between aligned Z lines (Figure 3d) and were as
frequent as in neonatal rat ventricles, in contrast to non-stimulated constructs where intercalated
discs were rare. Gap junctions were also substantially better developed (Figure 5.3e) and more
frequent (Figure 5.3f) in stimulated than in non-stimulated tissue constructs. The presence of T-
tubules (Figure 5.3e, inset) was evident in all samples. Overall, electrical stimulation of
contractility resulted in remarkably well-developed construct ultrastructure over only 8 days of in
vitro cultivation.
The optimal time point for the initiation of electrical stimulation -3 days post seeding -is
coincident with the appearance of spontaneous sporadic contractions of the cardiac tissue
constructs. If electrical stimulation was initiated too early (12 hr upon cell seeding on scaffolds,
designated as day 1), constructs could not be induced to contract synchronously in response to the
electric field stimulation, a finding consistent with the low degree of capture in monolayer
cultures of cardiomyocytes that were stimulated sooner than 6 to 8 hrs after isolation [35].
Constructs that were stimulated too early developed only weak contractile responses and
maintained a predominantly round cell morphology. The amount of cx-43 was substantially
reduced as compared to either non-stimulated constructs or constructs stimulated at a later time of
culture (Figure 5.4 a). Interestingly, the initiation of electrical stimulation late in culture (5 days
following cell seeding on scaffolds) enabled the establishment of gap junctions, but failed to
82
enhance functional organization of the contractile apparatus and cell morphology in response to
electrical stimulation (Figure 5.4 a).

DISCUSSION:
Excitation-contraction coupling is crucial for development and function of native
myocardium. Tissue culture systems available thus far, failed to induce orderly excitation-
contraction coupling during culture. As a result, engineered cardiac constructs did not exhibit
fully differentiated phenotype and parallel cell alignment. We hypothesized that electrical field
induced contractions of cardiac constructs during in vitro tissue culture will enhance functional
assembly and level of differentiation of engineered myocardium.
A commercial cardiac stimulator was used to generate electrical signals in order to induce
and maintain synchronous contractions of cultured tissues (square biphasic pulses, 2ms in
duration, supra-threshold amplitude of 5V/cm, frequency of I Hz). The applied voltage gradient
(5V/cm) was selected to be of the same order of magnitude as the endogenous electrical field
gradients that naturally occur in animal tissues [36]. The square biphasic pulses 2 ms in duration
are characteristic both for the native myocardium and the field stimulation of cardiac monolayers
[35, 37]. Thereby, synchronous macroscopic contractions of cultured tissues were induced under
controlled in vitro conditions by a physiologically relevant mechanism, using electrical signals
designed to mimic those generated within the heart.
Constructs were first cultured without electrical stimulation, to allow the cells to recover
from isolation during which the cells acquire a round shape and most of the cardiac proteins are
lost or disassembled [30]. Electrical stimulation was initiated at 1, 3 or 5 days following cell
seeding on scaffolds, and applied continuously for additional five days; non-stimulated, otherwise
identical tissue constructs served as controls. The progression of tissue assembly was assessed at
various hierarchical levels: molecular (expression levels, amounts and distributions of cardiac
proteins), cellular (cell number, viability, metabolism), ultrastructural (morphology of cells and
nuclei, development of sarcomeres, distribution and frequency of gap junctions, intercalated
discs, mitochondria, and microtubules), and functional (contractile activity, trans-membrane
potentials). All construct properties were compared to those measured for neonatal heart
ventricles.
Stimulated constructs exhibited superior contractile properties: significantly higher
amplitude of contraction and maximum capture rate and lower excitation threshold compared to
the unstimulated constructs (Figure 5.1). The basis for improved contractile properties was
improved tissue morphology (Figure 5.2) and ultrastructure (Figure 5.3). In stimulated
constructs cells expressing cardiac markers were elongated and arranged in parallel compared
with the initial (day 3) and non-stimulated constructs which had round scattered cells. In addition
the stimulated constructs had remarkably well developed ultrastructure with sarcomeres aligned
84
in parallel myofibrils, and abundance of mitochondria and glycogen. Non-stimulated constructs
had poorly developed, non-oriented sarcomeres and small number of mitochondria (Figure 5.3).

The collected experimental evidence is consistent with a concurrent, interactive and
progressive development of the conductive and contractile apparati in electrically stimulated
tissue constructs (Figure 5.4b). Applied extracellular electric fields resulted in a non-uniform
transmembrane potential with hyperpolarization at the anode end, depolarization at the cathode
end, and the largest membrane depolarization in the cells aligned in the direction of the field [38,
39]. At Day 3, oval cells aligned in the direction of the field would be the first to generate action
potentials and start contracting. As a result of field stimulation, processes form at the cells' ends
[40]and lamelopodia extende toward the cathode in the direction of the field [41], causing cell
elongation. The extension processes and cell elongation increase the probability that the
neighboring cells meet, and establish connections through gap junctions. Although Cx-43 is
present in the cells from day 3 (Western blots, Figure 5.10f), it is localized in the cytosol of round
segregated cells (histology, Figure 5.2d) suggesting the absence of functional connexons.
Cytoskeletal rearrangement that leads to cell elongation and extension may be similar to that
described for electrical stimulation of endothelial cells [42]and mediated through PI3K-Akt
pathways.
Once the gap junctions are established, electrical signals propagate through both the
extracellular matrix and intracellular space, and lead to the stronger, more synchronous
contractions and the formation of aligned myofibrils. The organization of contractile apparatus
parallels embryonic development, in which contractile proteins are first laid down within the cells
before contractions begin, and then organized into sarcomeres, resulting increased contractile
force [43].

Figure 5.5. Expression of a number of cardiac proteins as assessed by RT-PCR
Induction and sensing of stretch are crucial for the proper development and assembly of
sarcomeres. In this study, non-stimulated constructs had thick, diffused Z-lines (Figure 5.3c)
similar to those found in mice knockout for muscle LIM protein, a key Z-line protein for sensing
of stretch and signal propagation [44]. In a previous study, cardiac constructs exposed to cyclic
86
stretch assembled myofibrils with compact Z-lines [30]. Importantly, induction of contraction by
electrical stimulation ensures that calcium handling is unaltered [37] and that the capacity and
density of L type Ca2+channels are maintained [35].
The effects of electrical stimulation critically depended on the time of its initiation. During
isolation, myocytes disassemble much of their myofilament structure, yielding round cells that are
transiently incapable of contracting in response to electrical stimulation. After 3 days, the cells
have attached to the matrix and reassembled the machinery for excitation-contraction coupling, as
evidenced by occasional spontaneous contractions. The application of field stimulation at this
time orchestrates the assembly of myofibrils, cell elongation and establishment of gap junctions.
If stimulation is initiated too late (day 5), reassembly of contractile apparatus becomes difficult
and cell elongation does not occur, consistent with the finding [45] that the longer the time
myocytes were inhibited from contraction by L type channel blockers, the longer it took to
reassemble actin cytoskeleton.
Important areas of future work include optimizing the conditions of electrical stimulation
(frequency, field gradient, duration of stimulation), quantifying the effect of electrical field
stimulation on other cell types present in the native myocardium (endothelial cells, fibroblasts),
and testing the biological function and remodeling of the cardiac grafts after short-term and long-
term implantation in injured myocardium.

6. SEQUENTIAL CULTIVATION OF CARDIAC MYOCYTES AND CARDIAC
FIBROBLAST SUBPOPULATIONS RESULTS IN ROBUST CONTRACTILE
RESPONSE OF ENGINEERED CARDIAC TISSUE
INTRODUCTION:
Native myocardium consists of several cell types of which 1/3 are myocytes and most of
the non-myocytes are fibroblasts [1]. Cardiac myocytes are the largest cells in the myocardium,
they occupy -90% of the volume and are responsible for synchronous contractions of the
ventricles. The main roles of cardiac fibroblasts are to secrete the components of the extra-
cellular matrix (ECM) and transmit mechanical force by the receptor mediated connections to the
ECM [2]. The myocardial ECM consists of a fibrillar collagen network, with predominant
collagen type I and III, a basement membrane, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans and a variety
of bioactive molecules [3]. The exact composition of the ECM is regulated by a cross-talk
between myocytes and fibroblasts [2]. Recent studies demonstrated that cardiac fibroblasts can
propagate electrical stimuli over the distances on the order of 100m via gap junctional
communications [4].
Early attempts to engineer cardiac tissue involved the use of cell suspension enriched for
myocytes (80-90%) by pre-plating. [5, 6]. The engineered cardiac constructs exhibited markers of
cardiac differentiation and were able to propagate electrical signals over several millimeters. The
velocity of signal propagation increased with the fraction of myocytes in the starting ell
suspension [7] However, neither the force of contraction nor the amplitude of macroscopic
contractile response were investigated. Zimmerman et al. [8]recognized the importance of the
presence of multiple cell types in cultivating heart tissue in the presence of phasic stretch. The
engineered heart tissue based on a mixed cell population exhibited robust contractile force and
positive ionotropic response. Akhyari et al. [9]detected the presence of newly synthesized
collagen network in the tissue constructs based on passaged human pediatric heart cells,
illustrating the importance of fibroblasts in remodeling scaffolds in vitro. However, both studies
investigated only one cell composition and the ratio of cardiac myocytes to cardiac fibroblasts
was not quantified.
We hypothesized that the co-culture of cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes will
enhance functional assembly of the engineered cardiac constructs by enabling scaffold
remodeling and active cross-talk between cells. Cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes were separated
by pre-plating and applied to the poly(glycerol sebacate) scaffolds (biorubber) separately,
synchronously (unseparated) or serially (fibroblasts pretreatment followed by addition of
myocytes). Although, the presence of fibroblasts significantly improved the amplitude of
90
contraction of the engineered cardiac tissue, the pretreated group exhibited lower excitation
threshold and improved construct composition and morphology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Cell isolation:
Cardiomyocytes were obtained from -2 day old neonatal Sprague Dawley (Charles River) rats
according to procedures approved by the Institute's Committee on Animal Care, as previously
described [5]In brief, ventricles were quartered, incubated overnight at 4Â°C in a 0.06 % (w/v)
solution of trypsin in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Gibco), and subjected to a series of
digestions (3 min, 37Â°C, 150 rpm) in 0.1 % (w/v) solution of collagenase type II in HBSS. The
cell suspension from the digestions were collected and labeled "unseparated cells". To separate
myocytes and fibroblasts the cell suspension was centrifuged (750 rpm, 5 min), and the pellet was
resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco) containing 4.5 g/L
glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 units/ml
penicillin. The cells from the pellet were pre-plated in T75 flasks for one 75 min period to enrich
for cardiomyocytes. Cells that remained unattached were labeled "cardiomyocytes". The attached
cells were propagated for 3-7 days in culture, trypsinized as described previously [10]and labeled
"fibroblasts".
Construct preparation:
Porous biorubber, poly(glycerol-sebacate), scaffolds were prepared by salt leaching
technique. Disc 5mm diameter x 2 mm thick were sterilized by 70% ethanol overnight followed
by 4hr in 95% ethanol and hr in 100% ethanol. Ethanol was removed by vacuum filtration and
the scaffolds were rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco) for 1-4 hr followed by hr in
FBS. For construct pretreatment with fibroblasts, 1.106 fibroblasts were resuspended in 0lgl
MatrigelÂ® (BD) and applied to the scaffold as described previously [10]The constructs were
pretreated in six well plates (I construct/well) for 5 days in 5 ml of culture medium at 25 rpm.
Cell free scaffolds were kept in culture medium in identical conditions.
At the end of pretreatment cell-free scaffolds were seeded with 3-106 unseparated cells
(US) or 3 106 cardiomyocytes (CM) using Matrigel Â®. Scaffold pretreated with fibroblasts were
seeded with 2- 106 cardiomyocytes (CF+CM). The constructs were suspended on needles in 150
ml spinner flasks (Bellco) (6 constructs/flask) and cultivated for 6 days in 60 ml of culture
medium. Stirring at 30 rpm was initiated after 24 hr in culture. As a control we used constructs at
the end of pretreatment (CF0) and fibroblasts constructs at the end of culture in spinner flasks
(CF). (Table 6.1). Culture medium was exchanged by 100% after 3 days in spinner flask culture.

Assessment:
Cell composition:
The relative ratio of fibroblasts to myocytes in original cell suspensions was assessed by labeling of
intracellular markers in conjunction with fluorescence activated cell sorting. (FACS). The cells
separated by preplating were fixed and premeabilized with the solution of acetone and methanol (3:2)
at-20Â°C. To identify cardiomyocytes the cell suspension in 5%FBS/PBS (106cells/ml) was
incubated with mouse anti-troponin I (Clone 23C6, 1:100, Biodesign) or mouse anti-sarcomeric a-
actin (clone 5C5, 1:100, Sigma) for 30 min on ice, rinsed and incubated with fluorescein conjugated
horse anti-mouse IgG for additional 30 min on ice (1:400, Vector Laboratories). To identify
fibroblasts the cells were labeled with Cy 3 conjugated mouse anti-vimentin (clone V9, 1;200, Sigma)
for 30 min on ice. The fluorescence was read on FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Unlabeled cells and
cells labeled with secondary antibody only served as controls.
Biochemical and metabolic assessment:
Medium samples were taken at the end of pretreatment and after 3 and 6 days in spinner
flask culture and analyzed for glucose, lactate using a glucose and L-lactate analyzer Model 2300
STAT plus (Yellow Spring Instrument, [5])and for lactate dehydrogenase levels (LDH) using a
commercially available kit (LDH-L, Chiron Diagnostics, Carrier et al. 1999)
Samples for DNA, total protein and Western blot were taken at the end of pretreatment
(CF0) and at the end of culture (CF, US, CM CF+CM) weight and frozen in liquid nitrogen. They
were homogenized in a buffer (IN NH40H, 2% Triton X-100) by Mini-bead beater with 6 cycles
0ls cycles at 25 rpm. After centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12,000 g at 4Â°C, the homogenates
were stored at -80Â°C for further analysis.
For DNA assay, the homogenate was incubated at 37Â°C for 10 min and then diluted with
10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA buffer containing 100 mM NaCI (1:20). After centrifugation at 2,500g

Total protein was measured by a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad) as previously described [5,
6].
Contractile response:
The contractile function of engineered cardiac constructs was evaluated by monitoring contractile
activity upon electrical stimulation at 200X magnification using a microscope (Nikon Diaphot) at
the end of cultivation period as described [11]. Each constructs was placed in a 60 mm Petri dish
containing of 120 ml Tyrode's solution (140 mM NaCI, 5.4 mM KCI, 0.33 mM NaH2PO4, 1.8
mM CaCI2, I mM MgCI2, 5 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4) between two carbon rods
(Ladd Research Instruments) connected to a cardiac stimulator (Nihon Kohden). The
measurements were done at room temperature. The stimuli (square pulses, 2 ms duration) were
applied at a rate of 60 bpm starting at amplitude of V that was gradually increased until the
excitation threshold (ET) was reached and the entire construct was observed to beat
synchronously. Maximum capture rate (MCR) was determined at 200% of ET by increasing the
stimulation frequency until the paced contractions ceased or became irregular. For evaluation of
contraction amplitude, video recorded beating sequences (1-5 min) were digitized at the rate of 30
frames/s. The "face-sectional" area of each construct was determined as function of time using
image analysis software (Scion Image). Amplitude of contraction was expressed as fractional area
change.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Constructs were sampled at the end of pretreatment and cultivation, rinsed in PBS, and
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6-12 hrs. Samples were embedded in
paraffin, sectioned at 5 m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H + E) for general
evaluation. All samples were face sectioned within the first 100 m. Staining for cardiac
(troponin , sarcomeric ax-actin, connexin-43) and fibroblast markers (vimentin and prolyl-4-
hydroxylase) in n=2-6 samples per group was used to assess cell distribution and tissue
organization.
For immunofluorescence, sections were depariffinized and antigen was retrieved by heat
treatment for 20 minutes at 95Â°C in decloacking chamber (Biocare Medical), blocked with 10%
horse serum (Vector Laboratories) for 40 minutes at RT, then incubated for I hour at 37Â°C with
the following primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 1.5% horse
serum: polyclonal rabbit troponin I (Chemicon 1:200), polyclonal rabbit anti-Connexin-43
(Chemicon, 1:50), mouse anti-prolyl-4-hydroxylase 15 subunit (Clone 6-9H6, Chemicon 1:50),
mouse anti sarcomeric a-actin (cloneSCS, 1;100, Sigma) and mouse anti-vimentin Cy3
93
conjugated. (clone V9, Sigma, 1:100). Subsequently, the slides were rinsed in PBS and incubated
with the appropriate secondary antibodies (all from Vector Laboratories) for 30 minutes at 37Â°C:
fluorescein conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for Cx-43 and TnI visualization and
fluorescein conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:200) for 30 min at 37oC. The sections were
counterstained with DAPI and coverslipped (Vectorshield mounting medium with DAPI).
Neonatal rat ventricles and bovine articulate cartilage served as positive control and negative
control, respectively. For double staining the slides stained with sarcomeric a-actin were blocked
with 10% NHS as described above and incubated with mouse Cy3 conjugated anti-vimentin.
Construct architecture and cell distribution were assessed from stained tissue sections using a
fluorescent microscope (Axioplan, Zeiss) and Open Lab software. For quantification of relative
ratio of fibroblasts to myocytes, 1-4 pictures were taken at 40x from each section (n=2-5 sections
per group). The number of red (fibroblasts), green cells (myocytes) and blue nuclei was counted
by three independent observers.
Western blots
Construct homogenates were diluted (1;2) in Laemni buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5%
mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS and boiled for 5 minutes to denature proteins. They were separated
on 4-20% Tris-glycine minigels (Invitrogen) using Ix Tris/Glycine/SDS running buffer at a
constant voltage of 100 V for 2 hours at room temperature. Two or three independent constructs
from each group were analyzed to compare the expression of the protein bands, and each lane
was loaded with the same protein concentration (20 gg). SeeBlueÂ® Plus2 pre-stained standards
(Invitrogen) was used as a protein size marker. Eluted proteins were electroblotted in lx
Tris/Glycine/SDS running buffer (Bio-Rad) onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad)
at 100 V for 60 minutes at room temperature in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot cell. Blots were first
incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1 %Tween 20/PBS (PBS-T) at room temperature for I
hour to block non-specific binding and then, for an additional hr at 50 rpm, with the appropriate
primary antibody. The primary antibodies were: polyclonal rabbit anti-connexin-43 (Chemicon),
diluted 1:40 in PBS-T and polyclonal rabbit anti-troponin I (Chemicon) diluted 1:100 in PBS-T.
Blots were washed five times with PBS-T and incubated I hour at room temperature with sheep
anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Sigma). After five additional washes, the immunocomplexes were
developed using enhanced horseradish peroxidase-luminol chemiluminescence (ECL Western
blotting detection reagents, Amersham) and detected after exposure to photographic film
(Hyperfilm-ECL) for 5-30 seconds. Band intensity was quantified by an image analysis software
(Scion Image).

Statistical analysis of multiple experimental groups was performed using Tukey's test
followed by one way ANOVA for pairwise comparisons; p<0.05 was considered significant.
Normality and equality of variance were tested for all data sets.
RESULTS:
The starting cell populations had different ratios of fibroblasts to myocytes. (Figure 6.3a)
The unseparated (US) cell suspension obtained by heart digestion had -30% of myocytes and
-44% of vimentin positive cells, although the difference between the two values was not
statistically significant. The fibroblast group, obtained by expanding the cells attached to the
tissue culture plastic during pre-plate consisted of significantly more cells (-75%) expressing
vimentin and than those (6-18% )expressing cardiac markers (troponin I and ca-actin). The
suspension that remained unattached after one pre-plate was slightly but not significantly
enriched for myocytes with equal fractions of cells expressing cardiac markers. (4145%) to those
expressing vimentin (-40%).
Glucose consumption rate per construct (Table 6.2) was comparable in the group seeded with
the unseparated cells and cardiomyocyte group and it was higher in the group pretreated with
fibroblasts. The values expressed per 106 cells (0.24gmol/10 6cells/hr for CF0, 0.09 for US 0.08
for CM and 0.19 for CF+CM group) are on the order of those reported previously [11, 12]. Molar
ratio of lactate produced to glucose consumed (Table 6.2) was over 2 during the pretreatment in
six well plates consistent with the anaerobic cell metabolism and it decreased to 1.6-1.7 during
culture in spinner flask, reflecting better oxygen supply to all of the construct surfaces.
Regardless, the metabolism was still in the anaerobic range most likely due to the limitations of
the oxygen supply to the center of the construct. The levels of LDH increased during cultivation
and were significantly higher in the US and CM group compared to the pretreatment group,
indicating increased levels of cell damage.

We were able to reproducibly induce synchronous contractile response to electrical pacing in
groups seeded with myocytes alone (CM), unseparated cells (US) and group pretreated with
fibroblasts followed by the addition of myocytes (CF+CM). Constructs that contained mostly
fibroblasts, at the end of pretreatment (CF0) and the control group at the end of cultivation (CF)
could not be induced to contract synchronously. Occasional contractions of individual fibers were
observed at voltages between 5-8V. The group pretreated with fibroblasts followed by addition
of myocytes (CF+CM) had the lowest excitation threshold (Figure 6.1a) and the highest
amplitude of contraction (Figure 6.1c, d) compared with the CM and US group. The excitation
threshold was significantly higher in the US group compared to the CF+CM group and the
amplitude of contraction was significantly lower in the CM group compared to the CF+CM
group. Maximum capture rate was comparable in all groups (Figure 6.1lb).

Assessment of cell fractions from a-actin/vimentin co-stained sections indicated that the ratio
of myocytes to fibroblasts was maintained during pretreatment with fractions comparable in the
CF0 group to those of the original "fibroblast" cell suspension. (Figure 6.3b) The constructs
seeded with "unseparated" cell suspension also maintained the ratio fibroblasts to myocytes with
approximately equal cell fractions and statistically similar to those of the original cell suspension.
The group seeded with myocytes alone (CM) and the group pretreated with fibroblasts followed
by the addition of myocytes (CF+CM) had a significantly higher fraction of myocytes compared
to the fibroblasts at the end of spinner flask cultivation and the ratio of myocytes to fibroblasts
was comparable in these two groups.

After cultivation in spinner flasks, 100-200gm thick layer of tissue was formed at the outer-
surfaces of the tissue construct. Constructs based on fibroblasts only showed cell clustering in
98., iiI-1-
clumps or fiber like structure at the surfaces of the constructs. (Figure 6.4a) Constructs from the
CM, US and CF+CM group had relatively continuous layer of tissue covering the construct.
Co-staining for sarcomeric a-actin/vimentin (Figure 6.4b) indicated that the vimentin
positive cells (fibroblasts) were present at the outer surfaces of the tissue construct in the contact
with culture medium while the sarcomeric a-actin positive cells were located in the interior
within the myofiber-like structures. CF+CM group had the largest compact a-actin positive
regions. These compact regions of myocytes were present in the CM and US group constructs but
they were smaller and scattered around the face section.
Vimentin positive cells (Figure 6.4c) were dominant in the group seeded with the
"fibroblast" cell suspension forming scar-like tissue. In addition to covering the surface of the
tissue construct, they were scattered between the myocytes in the deeper layers of the tissue in the
CM, CF+CM and US group. A thick fibrous capsule occasionally formed at the contact between
the construct and the stainless steel needle used to suspend the constructs (Figure 6.4b,
CF+CM).

Cells expressing cardiac Troponin I (Figure 6.5a, b) were present in the constructs based on
the "fibroblast" cell suspension but they were sparse and with "star-like" morphology not typical
for cardiac myocytes. Troponin I (TnI) positive cells were frequent in the constructs from the CM
group, they had elongated morphology but there was no parallel alignment. In the US group cells
expressing TnI were elongated and arranged in parallel in short domains interrupted by larger
domains not expressing cardiac Tnl, whereas in CF+CM group Tnl positive cells formed large
domains of compact tissue with elongated cells aligned in parallel.
Fibroblasts expressing prolyl-4-hydroxylase (Figure 6.4d), an enzyme responsible for
collagen deposition, were detectable in all groups except in the constructs from the CM group.
The presence was very low in the constructs from the US group, and significant in the constructs
based on fibroblasts alone. In the CF+CM group, the cells expressing prolyl-4-hydroxylase were
scattered within the compact layer of tissue consisting predominantly of myocytes.

DISCUSSION:
Cardiac fibroblasts contribute to a considerable proportion of cells present in the native
myocardium [] The main role of fibroblasts is to secrete the components of the ECM and
transmit mechanical force [2]. In monolayer cultures of heart cells, fibroblasts are usually
removed before plating in order to prevent the overgrowth during culture. By analogy, in early
tissue engineering approaches, fibroblasts were routinely removed before culture and the
scaffolds were seeded with enriched suspensions of myocytes (80-90%) [6]. The engineered
cardiac tissue should ideally reproduce structure and function of the native myocardium and
presence of multiple cell types is one of the hallmarks of the native tissue.
We hypothesized that the co-culture of cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes will
enhance functional assembly of the engineered cardiac constructs by enabling scaffold
remodeling and active cross-talk between cells. The cells isolated form the neonatal rat hearts
were used as unseparated cell suspension, or separated in predominantly myocyte and
predominantly fibroblast (Figure 6.3a) fraction by preplating. In our experimental design,

unseparated cell suspension was applied to the biorubber scaffolds (US), myocyte fraction alone
was applied (CM) or myocytes were applied following the pretreatment of the scaffold with
fibroblasts (CF+CM).
As expected, the groups that had higher numbers of fibroblasts added to the scaffold (US,
CF+CM) had more robust contractile response, with the highest amplitude of contraction
observed in the CF+CM group (Figure 6.1c,d). Maximum capture rate was comparable in all of
the groups (Figure 6.1lb), but it was lower than the values reported for the similar constructs
previously [11] most likely due to the slightly lower duration of culture and the fact that these
measurements were taken at the room temperature. Consistent with the previous reports, US
group had higher excitation threshold than the CM group (Figure 6.1a) but unexpectedly, the
CF+CM group had statistically the lowest excitation threshold.
The superior contractile properties in the CF+CM group had the biochemical and
morphological basis. The DNA content of CF+CM group was significantly higher (Figure 6.2a)
compared to the other groups and comparable to that of the native heart, most likely contributing
to the decrease in the excitation threshold. Higher cellularity was correlated to the lower
excitation threshold in a previous study [ 1]. Consistent with the lower excitation threshold is the
high amount of the connexin-43 identified in Western blots for CM and CF+CM group (Figure
6.7d). The release of LDH as a measure of cell damage was the highest in the US group (Table
6.2), which was consistent with the low cellularity and high excitation threshold observed in this
group.
The protein content (Figure 6.2b) and metabolic activity (Table 6.1) was almost two
times as high in the CF+CM group compared to the other groups, most likely enabling the cells to
develop active force necessary for the high amplitude of construct contraction. Glucose
consumption rate as a measure of metabolic activity correlated well with the amplitude of
contraction with lowest values measured for CM group and the highest measured for CM+CF
group.
The amplitude of contraction correlated well with the orientation of the myocytes on the
construct surfaces. In the CF+CM group the cells expressing cardiac markers (Figure 6.4b,
Figure 6.5a,b), troponin I and sarcomeric a-actin were aligned in parallel in compact regions
resembling the myofibers in the native myocardium, allowing for a synchronous and vigorous
contractile response. In the US group, parallel alignment of the myocytes was observed in some
regions while myocytes in the CM group lacked a specific orientation, yielding low amplitude of
contraction.
103
The overwhelming difference between the CF+CM group and the CM group was that
CM group contained almost no cells expressing prolyl-4-hydroxylase (Figure 6.4g), indicting
that the fibroblasts present in the CM constructs were not involved in the deposition of collagen
as a component of the extracellular matrix. In the US group prolyl-4-hydroxylase cells were
present at low quantities, while the CF+CM group had a considerable fraction of prolyl-4-
hyrdoxylase cells scattered among the myocytes. In all groups vimentin positive cells were lining
the interface between the construct and culture medium (Figure 6.4b) thereby protecting the
myocytes from the turbulent environment present in the spinner flask. However, in the CF+CM
group the fibroblasts in the tissue interior were actively involved in scaffold remodeling and
deposition of ECM components.
The initial ratio of fibroblasts to myocytes (F/M) in the CM group was 0.9 (Figure 6.3a)
and it decreased to 0.6 after 6 days in culture (Figure 6.3b). In the US group the F/M was 1.5
and decreased to 1.0, while the CF+CM group had initial ratio of 1.2 (Figure 6.3a,b) that
decreased to 0.6. The data indicate that in all constructs fibroblasts were preferentially lost
compared to the myocytes, perhaps due to the involvement in scaffold remodeling. Although the
ratio of fibroblasts to myocytes was the same at the end of cultivation in the CF+CM and CM
group, the improved contractile properties in the CF+CM group can be attributed to the improved
morphology.
The presented data suggest that the presence of fibroblasts as well as the extracellular
components secreted by the fibroblasts significantly improve the properties of the engineered
heart tissue. When seeded at lower density during pretreatment, cardiac fibroblasts have enough
time to recover from the isolation procedure and start remodeling the polymeric scaffold by
secreting components of extracellular matrix and soluble factors. When myocytes are added to a
scaffold conditioned in such manner they encounter environment similar to that of the native
ventricle from which they have been isolated and supportive of the tissue assembly. It appears,
that when the myocytes and fibroblasts are seeded at the high density simultaneously (US) they
do not receive appropriate cues to engage in the scaffold remodeling and tissue assembly perhaps
due to the competition for oxygen. Constructs obtained from the myocyte enriched group (CM)
have even less chance of remodeling the scaffold due the lower number of fibroblasts present, and
although they maintain DNA levels they fail to accumulate protein as would be expected during
maturation in vivo.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that preconditioning of polymeric scaffolds with
fibroblasts creates an environment supportive of the assembly of heart tissue and improves the
contractile properties of engineered constructs.

7. BIOMIMETIC APPROACH TO CARDIAC TISSUE ENGINEERING:
OXYGEN CARRIERS AND CHANNELED SCAFFOLDS
INTRODUCTION
In vascularized tissues, such as myocardium, oxygen is supplied by convection of blood
through a capillary network and diffusion into the tissue space surrounding each capillary. At
physiological conditions, oxygen dissolved in blood plasma accounts for -1.5% of total oxygen
content of the blood [1, pg. 90]. Majority of oxygen carrying capacity of the blood comes from
hemoglobin, a natural oxygen carrier that ensures that sufficient oxygen is supplied to the tissue
in a single pass of blood though a capillary network at low flow rates (Re= 1).
In current cardiac tissue engineering approaches, tissue constructs were cultivated immersed
in culture medium in dishes [2], bioreactors [3-5], and in some cases in the presence of
mechanical stretch [6-8]. In all cases, oxygen transport through the tissue was largely governed
by molecular diffusion, which can support only a thin (100 -200 gm) surface layer of functional
tissue, and leaves construct interior hypoxic and acellular.
Cell distribution was markedly improved by seeding and cultivation in perfused cartridges,
due to the efficient supply of oxygen to cells throughout the constructs [9-11]. However, the
convective component of oxygen supply was provided by medium flow through the tissue
compartment. In a recent study [12] perfusion of culture medium through a single syngeneic
aorta embedded in the center of tissue engineered construct significantly improved metabolic
activity and viability of cardiac cells. Although, the compartment for medium flow was separated
in this case, the vessel diameter was too high to mimic the capillary network present in native
myocardium.
Our objective was to provide in vivo-like oxygen supply to the cells within engineered
cardiac constructs, and thereby enhance functional cell assembly (Table 7.1). To mimic the
capillary network, cells were cultured on an elastic, highly porous scaffold with a parallel array of
channels. To mimic oxygen supply by hemoglobin, the channel array was perfused with culture
medium supplemented with synthetic oxygen carriers (OxygentTM). OxygentTM is a is a 32%v/v
phospholipid stabilized emulsion of perfluorooctyl bromide as a principal component and a small
percentage of perfluorodecyl bromide [13]. Constructs perfused with unsupplemented culture
medium served as controls. Since they are immiscible with the aqueous phase of culture medium
perfluorocarbon (PFC) particles serve as rechargeable oxygen reservoirs. As oxygen is depleted
from the aqueous phase of culture medium it is replenished by diffusion from PFC particles.
Overall, the oxygen partial pressures measured in the aqueous phase of unsupplemented and PFC-
106
supplemented culture medium are the same. The PFC particles replenish oxygen consumed by the
cells without increasing oxygen concentration in culture medium. As a result, the total oxygen
content of the PFC supplemented medium is higher, supporting higher cell density per single pass
through the channel array.

Cell isolation: Cardiomyocytes were obtained from 1 -2 day old neonatal Sprague
Dawley (Charles River) rats according to procedures approved by the Institute's Committee on
Animal Care, as previously described [4]. In brief, ventricles were quartered, incubated overnight
at 4Â°C in a 0.06 % (w/v) solution of trypsin in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Gibcco),
and subjected to a series of digestions (3 min, 37Â°C, 150 rpm) in 0.1 % (w/v) solution of
collagenase type 11 in HBSS. The cell suspension from the digestions was collected. To separate
myocytes and fibroblasts the cell suspension was centrifuged (750 rpm, 5 min), and the pellet was
resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco) containing 4.5 g/L
glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 units/ml
penicillin. The cells from the pellet were pre-plated in T75 flasks for one 75 min period to enrich
for cardiomyocytes. Cells that remained unattached were labeled "cardiomyocytes". The attached
cells were propagated for 3-7 days in culture, trypsinized as described previously [10] and labeled
"fibroblasts".

Scaffold: Porous poly(glycerol-sebacate) scaffolds were by salt leaching technique.
Briefly, PGS solution in tetrahydrofuran was poured into a Teflon mold filled with NaCl particles
of desired sizes. The mold was transferred to a vacuum oven and cured at 120 Â°C and 100 mTorr.
The resulted material was soaked in deionized water to remove the NaC! particles. Scaffolds with
porosity up to 91% can be obtained after removal of water An array of cubically packed parallel
channels was bored on 120Watt CO2laser cutting/engraving system. Discs 5-6mm diameter x 2
mm thick were sterilized by 70% ethanol overnight followed by 4hr in 95% ethanol and I hr in
100% ethanol. Ethanol was removed by vacuum filtration and the scaffolds were rinsed in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco) for 1-4 hr followed by lhr in FBS. Channel diameter and
spacing was determined from the light micrographs using image analysis software (Scion Image).
Construct preparation and culture: For scaffold preconditioning with fibroblasts, 0.5-
1-106 fibroblasts were resuspended in 10gl MatrigelÂ® (BD) and applied to the scaffold as
described previously [10]. The constructs were pretreated in six well plates ( construct/well) for
4 days in 5 ml of culture medium at 25 rpm. At the end of preconditioing, 2.3-106
cardiomyocytes in 15 gl of MatrigelÂ® was added to the construct as described (Chapter 6) and
allowed to gel for 30 min at 37oC. The constructs were cultivated for additional 3 days in the
perfusion loops as described previously. [10, 11]. Briefly, the constructs were tightly fitted inside
the 5 mm ID, 10 mm OD silicone tubing rings, placed between two stainless steel screens and
positioned into 1.5 ml polycarbonate perfusion cartridges (kindly donated by the Advanced
Tissue Sciences, La Jolla, CA; one scaffold per cartridge). The screens (85% open area) provided
mechanical support during perfusion and the silicone ring routed the culture medium through the
central area of the construct. Constructs were subjected to unidirectional medium flow at 0.1
mL/min provided by the IsmaTec multichannel peristaltic pump (Figure 7.1A). Total volume of
culture medium in the gas exchanger tubing, medium bag and cartridge was 30 ml. To investigate
the effect of presence of oxygen carriers, 3 ml of OxygentMwas added to the 27 ml of culture
medium, kindly donated by the Alliance Pharmaceuticals Corps, San Diego CA.
Unsupplemented culture medium served as a control. A total of 7 rat litters was used in 7
independent experiments with n = 4 -6 constructs per experiment.

Figure 7. I.Schematics of the model system. (A) Perfusion loop. Channeled biorubber scaffolds
(7) preconditioned with cardiac fibroblasts were seeded with cardiac myocytes and placed into
perfusion cartridges (4) between two debubbling syringes (5,6). Mediumflow (0.1 ml/min)
was provided by a multi-channel peristaltic pump () and gas exchange was provided by a coil
of thin silicone tubing (3m long) (2). Loops were placed in the 37oC/5%C02 incubator
vertically, so that the reservoir bag (3) also served as a bubble trap. (B) Main modes of oxygen
transport in the channeled construct perfused with culture medium include convection through
the channel lumen and diffusion into the construct space surrounding each channel. Medium
supplemented by 10%PFC emulsion is replenished by the release of oxygen from the PFC
particles into the culture medium phase which is governed by Henry's law.
Measurement of PFC concentration: Since perfusion loops were placed vertically
during culture so that the medium reservoir bag acts as a bubble trap there was a some
precipitation of the heavier PFC emulsion in the lower part of the loop (perfusion cartridge and
gas exchanger). To determine the exact concentration of circulating PFC, lower part of the loop
was sectioned off at the end of cultivation, the medium was collected and the concentration of
emulsion was determined spectrophotometrically. For standard curve, PFC emulsion (OxygentTM)
109PFC particlesI

was diluted at known concentrations in culture medium. The resulting standard emulsions were
further diluted in phosphate buffer saline (1:10), and the absorbance was read at 970 nm
(wavelength corresponding to the maximum absorbance as determined from wavelength scans).
Biochemical and metabolical assessments: Medium samples were taken at the end of
pretreatment and cultivation and analyzed for glucose, lactate using a glucose and L-lactate
analyzer Model 2300 STAT plus (Yellow Spring Instrument, [4]) and for lactate dehydrogenase
levels (LDH) using a commercially available kit (LDH-L, Chiron Diagnostics, [4]). Gas
composition and pH at the inlet to perfusion cartridge was measured from medium samples using
a gas blood analyzer (Model 1610, Lexington, MA). Oxygen concentration at the outlet of the
perfusion cartridges was measured by inline ruthenium based oxygen sensors, kindly donated by
Payload Systems, Inc.
Samples for DNA, total protein and Western blot were taken at the end culture, weighted
and frozen in liquid nitrogen. They were homogenized in an extraction buffer (1N NH4OH, 2%
Triton X-100) by Mini-bead beater (Biospec, Bartlesville, OK) with 6 cycles 10s duration at 25
rpm. After centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12,000 g at 4Â°C, the homogenates were stored at -80Â°C
for further analysis. For DNA assay, the homogenate was incubated at 37Â°C for 10 min and then
diluted with 10 mM Tris-1 mM EDTA buffer containing 100 mM NaCI (1:20). After
centrifugation at 2,500g for 30 min, the supernatant to measure DNA content fluorometrically by
Hoescht dye binding [4]. Total protein was measured by a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad)
as previously described [3, 4].
Contractile response: The contractile function of engineered cardiac constructs was
evaluated by monitoring contractile activity upon electrical stimulation at 200X magnification
using a microscope (Nikon Diaphot) at the end of cultivation period. Each constructs was placed
in a 60 mm Petri dish containing of 120 ml Tyrode's solution (140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCI, 0.33
mM NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCI2, I mM MgCI2, 5 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4) between
two carbon rods (Ladd Research Instruments) connected to a cardiac stimulator (Nihon Kohden).
The measurements were done at room temperature. The stimuli (square pulses, 2 ms duration)
were applied at a rate of 60 bpm starting at amplitude of V that was gradually increased until
the excitation threshold (ET) was reached and the entire construct was observed to beat
synchronously. Maximum capture rate (MCR) was determined at 200% of ET by increasing the
stimulation frequency until the paced contractions ceased or became irregular.
110
Scanning electron microscopy: At the end of cultivation samples were fixed in formalin
overnight, rinsed in PBS and assessed for cell distribution and morphology using an
environmental scanning electron microscope (Philips/FEI XL30 FEG-SEM).
Western blots:Construct homogenates were diluted (1:2) in Laemni buffer (Bio-Rad)
containing 5% mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS and boiled for 5 minutes to denature proteins. They
were separated on 4-20% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen) using lx Tris/Glycine/SDS running buffer
(Bio-Rad) at a constant voltage of 100 V for 2 hours at room temperature. Four independent
constructs from each group were analyzed to compare the expression of proteins and each lane
was loaded with the same total protein concentration (20 g). SeeBlueÂ® Plus2 pre-stained
standards (Invitrogen) was as a protein size marker. The gel was electroblotted in lx
Tris/Glycine/Methanol blotting buffer (Bio-Rad) onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-
Rad) at 100 V for I hour at room temperature in a Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). Blots were first
incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (PBS-T) at room temperature for I
hour to block non-specific binding and then, for an additional I hour at 50 rpm, with the
appropriate primary antibody. The primary antibodies were: (1) polyclonal rabbit anti-Connexin-
43 (Chemicon), diluted 1:40 in PBS-T and (2) polyclonal rabbit anti-troponin I (Chemicon),
diluted 1:100 in PBS-T. Blots were washed five times with PBS-T and incubated hour at room
temperature with sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Sigma). After five additional washes, the blot
was developed using enhanced horseradish peroxidase-luminol chemiluminescence (ECL
Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham) and the immunocomplexes were detected after
exposure to photographic film (Hyperfilm-ECL, Amersham) for 5-30 seconds. Band intensity
was quantified by an image analysis software (Scion Image).
Histology and Immunohistochemistry: Constructs were sampled at the end of pretreatment
and cultivation, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 gm, and cross-sectioned or faced sectioned
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H + E) for general evaluation. Staining for cardiac
(troponin , connexin-43) and fibroblast markers (vimentin) used to assess cell distribution and
tissue organization.
For immunofluorescence, sections were depariffinized and antigen was retrieved by heat
treatment for 20 minutes at 95Â°C in deckloacking chamber (Biocare Medical), blocked with 10%
horse serum (Vector Laboratories) for 40 minutes at RT, then incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C with
polyclonal rabbit anti-Connexin-43 (Chemicon, 1:40), or with a mixture of polyclonal rabbit
troponin I (Chemicon 1:200) and mouse anti-vimentin Cy3 conjugated. (clone V9, Sigma, 1:100)
for double staining. All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 1.5%
111
horse serum. For Connexin-43 and Troponin-I visualization, the slides were rinsed in PBS and
incubated with fluorescein conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 30min at 37Â°C. The
sections were counterstained with DAPI and coverslipped (Vectorshield mounting medium with
DAPI). Neonatal rat ventricles and bovine articulate cartilage served as positive control and
negative control, respectively. Construct architecture and cell distribution were assessed from
stained tissue sections using a fluorescent microscope (Axioplan, Zeiss) and Open Lab software.
Statistical analysis was done using SigmaStat 3.0 (SPSS). All data sets were tested for
normality and equality of variance. Statistically significant differences were determined by
Students t-test or by Rank sum test. P<0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Precipitation of heavy PFC particles in the lower portions of the perfusion loop resulted in the
effective volume fraction of the circulating PFC emulsion of 5.4 + 0.3%. Oxygen partial pressure
in culture medium in the PFC group was lower than in the culture medium group (Table 7.2).
There were no significant differences in levels of pCO2and pH and in the glucose metabolism
between the groups supplemented with PFC emulsion and perfused with pure culture medium
(Table 7.2). The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a measure of cell damage, was
significantly lower in the group perfused with PFC emulsion as compared to the group perfused
with culture medium alone, indicating less cell death in the PFC group.
After 3 days of culture, constructs from both groups were able to respond by synchronous
contractions to the electrical field stimulation provided by a cardiac stimulator. Excitation
threshold was significantly lower (Figure 7.2A), the maximum capture rate was slightly but not
significantly lower in the PFC group as compared to the group cultivated with culture medium
alone (Figure 7.2B).

Consistent with the higher excitation threshold, DNA content per construct was significantly
higher (-60%) in the group cultivated with PFC emulsion compared to the culture medium alone
(Figure 7.3A). Construct wet weight was higher in the group perfused with PFC emulsion (24.9 Â±

Scanning electron microscopy of the laser machined poly(glycerol-sebacate) revealed the
presence (Figure 7.4 A,B) of a cubically packed parallel channel array. As determined from light
micrographs of dry scaffold, average channel diameter was 377 Â± 52 pgm (Ave Â± SD) and wall-to-
wall spacing was 222pgm (median) (25thpercentile 210 ptm, 75di percentile 279 gin). The pores in
the channel walls remained open during cultivation allowing for nutrient and oxygen exchange
with the surrounding tissue space. (Figure 7.4 B). After 3 days in culture dense cell patches were
covering the surface and the pores of the tissue constructs in both groups (Figure 7.4C,D).
Scanning electron microscopy of the construct interior revealed the presence of cell patches
throughout the construct cross-sections in both groups. (Figure 7.4 E,F). Although, large number
of open channels with cells coating the walls was present in both groups (Figure 7.4 G,H) cell
density was higher in the PFC group as compared to the culture medium group. As assessed from
the fluorescent micrographs of the wet constructs, the average channel diameter after cultivation
was comparable in both groups and significantly smaller than that before cultivation and the
channel wall-to-wall spacing became slightly higher (335 46gm and 364gm (median) (25th
percentile 341 m, 75hpercentile 402 .m) respectively). The constructs thickness was estimated
from histological cross-sections to be 2.08 Â± 0.2 mm (Ave Â±+ SD).

The presence of gap junctions was detected in both groups by staining for cardiac Connexin-
43 (Figure 7.5A). Double staining for cardiac troponin I and vimentin indicated that the
constructs consisted of mixture of cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts although, the
myocytes appeared to constitute the majority of cell population (Figure 5A). Western blotting
for cardiac markers confirmed the presence of cardiac Troponin I and gap junction protein
connexin 43 (Figure 7.5B). Image analysis of the bands, indicated higher relative presence of
troponin I and connexin 43 in the group supplemented with PFC emulsion compared to the
culture medium alone (Figure 7.5C).
DISCUSSION
In native vascularized tissues, high cell density (108 cells/cm3) is supported by the flow of
oxygen rich blood trough a dense capillary network (Table 7.1). Oxygen diffuses from the blood
into the tissue space surrounding each capillary. Since the solubility of oxygen in plasma at 37Â°C
is very low (130gM in arterial blood), the presence of a natural oxygen carrier, hemoglobin
increases the total oxygen content of blood by carrying 65 times more oxygen than the blood
plasma alone (8,630 gM). Under physiological conditions, only a fraction of oxygen is depleted
from the blood in a single pass through capillary network. The difference in oxygen concentration
in plasma between arterial and venous blood is -76gM, and approximately 2,680 M of
oxyhemoglobin is depleted [1]. We report a biomimetic in vitro culture system in which cardiac
tissue is engineered using a scaffold with parallel channel array (to mimick the role of capillary
network) and synthetic oxygen carriers, perfluorooctyl bromide emulsion.
Unlike hemoglobin, which has binding sites for oxygen, oxygen content in neat
perfluorooctyl bromide (C8F17Br) is governed by Henry's law, with liner relationship between
atmospheric pO2 and oxygen concentration. Solubility of oxygen in neat C8F17Br is -17 times
higher than solubility of oxygen in water. Since neat PFCs are immiscible with water,
preparations that are used as oxygen carriers in e.g blood substitutes have to be emulsified and
stabilized with appropriate surfactants [13]. OxygentTM used in this work is a 32v/v% (60%w/v),
perflurooctyl bromide emulsion with average particle size of 0.2gm. [13].

Culture medium supplemented with OxygentTm, PFC emulsion, was perfused at the linear
velocity similar to that in the capillary network (560gpm/s) through a scaffold with parallel
channel array. Since neat perfluorocarbon has -2 times higher density than water, the emulsion
precipitates in the lower portions of the perfusion loop, yielding circulating PFC concentration of
5.4%v/v. At those conditions total oxygen content of the medium supplemented with PFC is
approximately twice as high as that of the unsupplemented culture medium. (Table 7.1).
As the medium flows through the channel array, oxygen is depleted from the aqueous phase
of the culture medium by diffusion into the construct space where it is used in cardiac myocyte
respiration (Figure 7.1 A,B). Depletion of oxygen in the aqueous phase acts as a driving force
for the release of oxygen from the PFC particles, thereby contributing to the maintenance of
higher oxygen concentrations in the medium. (Figure 7.1 B). Due to the small size of PFC
particles, the release of oxygen from the PFC phase into the aqueous phase is a very fast process,
and estimated not to be rate limiting in this system (Chapter 8). For comparison, in un-
supplemented culture medium, oxygen is depleted faster since there is no oxygen carrier phase
that acts as a reservoir. For a detailed model of oxygen profiles and transport processes in the
tissue construct with and without the PFC emulsion please see Chapter 8.
Supplementation of the culture medium with PFC emulsion did not have significant effects
on pH and pCO2at the inlet of the perfusion cartridge (Table 7.2). Both were maintained within
the physiological range and were indistinguishable from the values measured for the
unsupplemented culture medium. Lower partial pressure of oxygen at the inlet of the perfusion
cartridge was consistent with the fact that PFC supplemented culture medium requires longer
residence time in the gas exchanger (i.e longer gas exchanger) in order to fully equilibrate with
the atmospheric oxygen.(Table 7.2). At the outlet of perfusion cartridge, higher oxygen partial
pressure in the PFC group was consistent with the increased total oxygen content in the PFC
group compared to the culture medium group. Overall, change in the partial pressure of oxygen in
the aqueous phase was almost two times higher in the group perused with pure culture medium
(45mmHg), compared to the group perfused with the PFC emulsion (28mmHg), consistent with
-2 times higher total oxygen content in the PFC emulsion.
At the flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, total oxygen concentration consumed from the culture
medium was estimated to be 62 M and total oxygen consumed from the PFC supplemented
medium was higher, 82 [tM (aqueous phase +PFC phase). Improved delivery of oxygen to the
tissue constructs resulted in significantly higher DNA content in the PFC supplemented group
compared to the unsupplemented group (Figure 7.3A). The corresponding number of cells per
construct in the PFC group was 1.36-106 and for culture medium group it was 0.87 .106,
118
indicating that the cell number decreased during culture in both groups from the initial number of
seeded cells (3- 106), but at slower rate in the PFC group. Less cell damage and death in the PFC
group is also consistent with the significantly lower levels of LDH release (Table 7.2).
Although, protein content was higher in the PFC supplemented group compared to the culture
medium alone (0.74 i 0.10 mg vs. 0.62 Â± 0.04 mg respectively) oxygen consumption per unit of
protein was comparable in both groups (1 lnmol/min/mg protein for PFC and 10 nmol/min/mg
protein of culture medium group) and comparable to the previously reported values [14]. Glucose
metabolism was comparable in both groups, with slightly lower consumption rates in the PFC
group (Table 7.2) and lower L/G ratio indicative of more aerobic cell metabolism compared to
the culture medium group (Table 7.2). Consistent with the improved oxygen supply is also higher
ratio of oxygen/glucose consumed in the PFC group compared to the culture medium alone (2.4
mol/mol vs. 1.4mol/mol respectively).
Resulting cell density in the PFC group was higher than in the culture medium alone
(0.43.108 cells/cm3vs. 0.27. 108 cells/cm3), but it was still lower than the values we reported
previously (-1 108cells/cm3) for perfusion of constructs based on collagen sponges [ 1]. Most
likely, the reason is a higher affinity of cells for collagen scaffold compared to the biorubber
scaffold, resulting in improved cell attachment in collagen scaffolds. However, poor mechanical
properties of collagen and large degree of swelling (approximately 30% immediately following
hydration in culture medium, [10]) do not allow for creation of a channel array. Cell attachment
onto biorubber can be improved by functionilizing the scaffold e.g through the addition of RGD
domains without compromising mechanical properties such as elastomeric behavior and low
degree of swelling.
As a result of higher cell density in the constructs cultivated with the PFC supplemented
culture medium, enhanced electrical coupling of cardiac myocytes, improved the maintenance of
differentiated phenotype as assessed by higher expression of cardiac troponin I and connexin-43
(Figure 7.5 A,B,C) and improved contractile properties of engineered constructs in the PFC
group compared to the culture medium group (Figure 7.2 A).
At the end of cultivation most of the channels remained open with walls coated with dense
patches of cells (Figure 7.4). Although cells were present between the channels, a compact and
continuous layer of tissue was not formed. In order to achieve that scaffolds can be seeded with
higher number of cells, constructs can be cultivated for longer time periods so that the cells have
an opportunity to elongate and the scaffold can be optimized for cell attachment and migration by
e.g addition of RGD domains. At the end of cultivation, channel diameter was significantly
119
smaller compared to the channel diameter in the dry scaffold not only due to the cell infiltration
but also due to the small degree of swelling.
In summary, we developed a biomimetic culture system in which cardiac fibroblasts and
myocytes are co-cultured on scaffolds with parallel channel array that mimics the role of capillary
network perfused at 500gm/s with the culture medium supplemented with the PFC oxygen carrier
that mimics the role of hemoglobin. Although the supplementation of PFC emulsion increased
total oxygen content of the medium by 100% it was still significantly lower than oxygen content
of the blood. The increase in oxygen content had an effect on cell density and DNA content that
was -60% higher in the PFC group compared to the culture medium group. As a result,
contractile properties and protein expression were improved in the PFC group.

8.MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF OXYGEN DISTRIBUTION IN ENGINEERED CARDIAC
TISSUE WITH PARALLEL CHANNEL ARRAY PERFUSED WITH CULTURE MEDIUM
SUPPLEMENTED WITH SYNTHETIC OXYGEN CARRIERS
INTRODUCTION:
The key parameter in engineering functional 3D tissues in vitro is oxygen supply [1-3]. In
native rat heart, oxygen is supplied by diffusion from capillaries that are spaced -20 pm apart[4].
Since the solubility of oxygen in plasma is low, the oxygen carrier, hemoglobin increases total
oxygen content of blood and therefore increases the mass of tissue that can be supported in a
single pass through capillary network The average oxygen concentration in arterial blood is
130gM and in the venous blood it is 54 p.M [].
In conventional tissue engineering approaches, cells are supported on polymer scaffolds to
form tissue constructs immersed in culture medium. Oxygen dissolved in the medium is
transported by diffusion from the surface of the tissue construct into its interior. The medium is
re-oxygenated via a gas exchanger [5], by aeration or by membrane exchange [2]. Diffusion alone
is capable of providing enough oxygen for --100 gm thick outer layer of a tissue construct while
the interior remains relatively acellular or becomes necrotic due to hypoxia [6].
To resolve this problem a perfusion bioreactor system has been developed [7]. In such a
system the entire construct is directly perfused with culture medium, and the transport of oxygen
from the medium to the cells occurs via both diffusion and convection. However, the solubility
of oxygen in water at 37 Â°C is not enough to satisfy metabolic demand of large number of cells
(e.g. 5 .108 cells/cm3construct) at low flow rates (e.g. 0.5 ml/min/cm2). Increasing the flow rate
increases the shear stress exerted on the cells, which in turn can decreases viability and cell
number. To provide enough oxygen for thick constructs at low flow rates, it is necessary to have
a pool of oxygen in the medium, available to quickly meet changing local oxygen demand. By
utilizing synthetic oxygen carriers (perfluorocarbons), the length of tissue construct that can be
supported per single pass through perfusion bioreactor at a given flow rate will be increased.
Our main hypothesis is that functional assembly of engineered cardiac tissue will be
enhanced by increasing local oxygen concentration in the tissue space within the physiological
range (up to 220p.M). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that cardiac constructs
cultivated in perfusion at -80gM exhibit weaker presence of cardiac markers, and poorer
organization of contractile apparatus compared to the constructs cultivated at -220gm [8]. In
addition it was demonstrated that isolated cardiomyocytes begin to downregulate energy using
processes at oxygen concentrations as high as 70gM[9].
122
In order to test this hypothesis, we recently reported a biomimetic in vitro tissue culture
system in which neonatal rat heart cells were cultured on an elastic, highly porous scaffold with a
parallel array of channels perfused with culture medium supplemented with the a synthetic
oxygen carrier (OxygentTM, perfluorocarbon emulsion -PFC). In this system, the parallel channel
array mimics the role of capillary network and the PFC emulsion mimics the role of hemoglobin.
Constructs perfused with unsupplemented culture medium served as controls.
In this paper a steady state mathematical model that relates distribution of oxygen within the
engineered tissue construct to the medium flow rate, partial pressure of oxygen and mass fraction
of oxygen carrier is derived and solved using the finite element method. The model was used to
compare oxygen distribution in the experimentally obtained channeled cardiac tissue constructs
perfused with pure culture medium and with PFC supplemented culture medium. In addition, the
model was used to define optimum scaffold geometry and flow conditions necessary to cultivate
cardiac constructs of physiologically high cell density (108cells/cm3) and clinically relevant
thickness (0.5cm). As a part of assumption validation resistances to the transport of oxygen were
compared in each phase, indicating that the transfer of oxygen from the PFC phase into the
aqueous phase was not rate limiting. Addition of PFC emulsion improved oxygen transport by
improving apparent average velocity and by increasing effective diffusivity.
GOVERNING EQUATIONS
Let Cp and Ca be oxygen concentrations in the PFC and aqueous phase respectively in a
system depicted in Figure 8.1 and b fraction of PFC emulsion.. Assuming that the drops are (i)
small enough that the concentration is nearly uniform within a given drop and (ii) each drop is
very nearly in equilibrium with the adjacent media, the total 02 concentration at any point in the
emulsion is:
Coal, = (0- )Ca + ObCp (1)
Since by definition partition coefficient is K=C/Ca:
C,,,a = [I + (K -)0]Ca (2)
Treating the emulsion as a homogenous fluid of constant density conservation of equation for
oxygen at steady state can be expressed as:
va VC, =-VJ (3)
where v. is velocity and J is the flux of oxygen relative to v. (the diffusive flux).The diffusive
flux can be expressed in terms of either Ctoaw or Ca; the latter is preferable since Ca is more
convenient for matching concentrations at the emulsion-tissue interface. Choosing Ca gives:
123
J = -DDffV2C, (4)
where Deff is effective diffusivity, defined by [10, pg91] ::
Def= D 1+3 YI 20 (5)
In Eq. 5 Da is diffusivity of aqueous phase of culture medium, KDp/Da and Keff=l for the case
when emulsion concentration is based upon the continuous phase concentration.
Combining Eq. 1-4 the steady state oxygen conservation equation becomes:
[l + (K- 1)0]va VCa = -DV2Ca (6)
Similarly, the conservation equation for oxygen in the tissue space can be expressed as:
v, VC, =-D,V2C, +R (7)
where R is oxygen consumption rate according to the Michaelis-Mentent kinetics:
(8)
R = VC,
Km+Ct
Since permeability of channels is significantly greater than the permeability of tissue
space, it is reasonable to assume that radial velocity component can be neglected in the channel
and that there is no convection in the tissue space [11]. In order to confirm this assumption,
hydraulic permeability of channel-free biorubber scaffold was experimentally estimated to be 8.1
+ 0.4 10-12 m2[(m3/s)/m2] [(Pa s) m/Pa] (please refer to experimental section).
Based on Darcy permeability, the average axial velocity in the scaffold space was
estimated to be 1.7 10'4cm/s. The scaffold axial Pe number was calculated as::
Pe = U(R,-R) (9)
Da
For the experimentally obtained channel geometry, Pe,=0.09. For the proposed thick scaffold
(0.Scm) with dense packing of narrow channels (100m channel diameter and 100gm channel
spacing), the estimated scaffold axial velocity was 4.7 104cm/s (at the highest flow rate
investigated) and Pe, number was 0.095. As Matrigel/cell suspension is added to the scaffold it
is expected that the permeability of the tissue space and axial tissue Peclet number would
decrease even further. The value of 0.095 is the upper bound of the tissue Pe number obtainable
in this system, thus justifying the assumption of no convection in the tissue space.
Accordingly, the conservation equations for oxygen in the channel lumen can be
rewritten as:
124
(10)
~~fLDF~krra~~aa 2Ca1[I +(K- )] v(r)aa=D I la )r'Ca + aZ2
This governing equation is of the same form as Equation 15 given in Shah and Mehra [12] except
that they did not take effective diffusivity into account. Although axial diffusion can be neglected
in Eq. 10 due to the relatively high value of Pe, the software used for numerical solution
considered axial diffusion automatically. Governing equation for oxygen distribution in the tissue
region can be expressed as:

METHODS:
Experimental studies
Cultivation of the cardiac tissue constructs:
Porous poly(glycerol-sebacate) scaffolds were fabricated by means of a salt leaching technique.
Briefly, PGS solution in tetrahydrofuran was poured into a Teflon mold filled with NaCI particles
of desired sizes. The mold was transferred to a vacuum oven and cured at 120 Â°C and 100 mTorr.
The resulting material was soaked in deionized water to remove the NaCI particles. Scaffolds
with porosity up to 91% were obtained after removal of water. An array of cubically packed
parallel channels was bored using a 120Watt CO2laser cutting/engraving system (Model X-660,
Universal Laser Systems, Scottsdale AZ). Discs 5-6mm diameter x 2 mm thick were sterilized by
70% ethanol overnight followed by 4hr in 95% ethanol and I hr in 100% ethanol. Ethanol was
removed by vacuum filtration and the scaffolds were rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS,
Gibco) for 1-4 hr followed by hr in FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Gibco). Channel diameter and
spacing was determined from the light micrographs using image analysis software (Scion Image)

Cells were isolated from neonatal rat ventricles as described previously [8]. For scaffold
preconditioning with fibroblasts, 0.5-1-106 fibroblasts were resuspended in 10gl MatrigelÂ® (BD)
and applied to the scaffold as described previously [13]. The constructs were pretreated in six
well plates ( construct/well) for 4 days in 5 ml of culture medium at 25 rpm. At the end of
preconditioning, 2.3.106 cardiomyocytes in 15 gl of MatrigelÂ® was added to the construct, and
allowed to gel for 30 min at 37Â°C. The constructs were cultivated in the perfusion loops for
additional 3 days as described previously. [14]. Briefly, the constructs were tightly fitted inside
the 5 mm ID, 10 mm OD silicone tubing rings, placed between two stainless steel screens and
positioned into 1.5 ml polycarbonate perfusion cartridges (kindly donated by the Advanced
Tissue Sciences, La Jolla, CA; one scaffold per cartridge). The screens (85% open area) provided
mechanical support during perfusion and the silicone ring routed the culture medium through the
central area of the construct. Constructs were subjected to unidirectional medium flow at 0.1
mL/min provided by the IsmaTec multichannel peristaltic pump. The total volume of culture
medium in the gas exchanger tubing, medium bag and cartridge was 30 ml. To investigate the
effect of presence of oxygen carriers, the 27 ml of culture medium was mixed with 3ml of
perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsion (OxygentTM, kindly donated by the Alliance Pharmaceuticals
Crops, San Diego, CA). Unsupplemented culture medium served as a control. A total of 7 rat
litters were used in 7 independent experiments with n = 4 -6 constructs per experiment.
Gas composition and pH at the inlet to perfusion cartridge was measured from medium
samples using a gas blood analyzer (Model 1610, Lexington, MA). Oxygen concentration at the
outlet of the perfusion cartridges was measured by in-line ruthenium based oxygen sensors
(kindly donated by Payload Systems). The fraction of circulating PFC emulsion was determined
by sectioning-off the lower portions of the loop, collecting the culture medium with PFC
emulsion and determining the absorbance of dilute emulsion at 970nm.
At the end of cultivation constructs were collected and evaluated for protein, DNA
content, contractile response, cell distribution and expression of cardiac markers. Fluorescent
micrographs of the wet constructs were used in conjunction with an image analysis program
(Scion image) to determined channel diameter and spacing after culture. Construct diameter and
height was determined from histological sections.

Evaluation of hydraulic permeability of biorubber scaffold:
For evaluation of hydraulic permeability, a 5mm thick piece of biorubber scaffold
without the channels was fitted into perfusion cartridge with 5mm diameter of open area, and
connected to the water reservoir via silicone tubing and 3 way stop-cock. The water reservoir was
placed at the height of 1. 195m in order to provide a constant pressure head. To determine flow
rate, the water draining from the perfusion cartridge upon the opening of 3 way stop cock was
collected at timed intervals. Flow around the scaffold was prevented by fixing the scaffold
between silicone gaskets as described previously [14]. The measurement was performed at room
temperature (22Â°C). Hydraulic permeability was determined based on Darcy's law (Eg.12).

MODEL PARAMETERS:
A mathematical model was implemented for the set of experimental conditions
summarized in Table 8.2. Average number of channels per construct was calculated based on the
measurements of channel radius, spacing and construct diameter. The flow rate and average
velocity per channel was calculated based on the imposed flow rate (0.1 ml/min) and the number
of channels. Maximum oxygen consumption (Vmax) rate was calculated based on the protein
content, scaffold volume (without channels) and maximum consumption rate per unit protein
reported for non-beating monolayers of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes [ 15]. The non-beating rather
than beating values were used due to the observation that constructs usually do not exhibit
spontaneous contractions within the first three days of cultivation. The fraction of circulating
PFC emulsion droplets () was higher than the nominal fraction (5.4vol % vs. 3.2%) due to some
settling in the lower portions of the loop. The circulating PFC fraction was determined
spectrophotometrically after the medium was collected from the lower portions of the loop.
In addition, mathematical modeling was used to predict oxygen concentration profiles in
tissue constructs of clinically relevant thickness (0.Scm) with various channel geometry (diameter
and spacing), flow rates, cell density and concentration of circulating PFC emulsion. The main
goal was to determine channel geometry and culture conditions (flow rate and concentration of
128
PFC emulsion) that would yield high oxygen concentrations in the tissue space at physiologically
high cell densities (108cell/cm3).
In one case, oxygen concentration profiles were compared in a 0.5 cm thick tissue
construct with 330gm channel diameter, 370gm wall-to-wall spacing perfused at the average
linear velocity per channel of 0.049cm/s (or 0.lml/min bulk flow) with culture medium
supplemented with 0, 3.2, 6.4 vol% PFC emulsion (0, 10 or 20 vol% of OxygentM). The channel
geometry and flow conditions used for these simulations were the same as those utilized in
experimental studies. The simulations were performed at two cell densities: 0.27.108 cells/cm3
which is a low value measured experimentally and 1. 108 cells/cm3which is a physiologically
relevant density. The cells were assumed to be uniformly distributed around the channel. The
corresponding maximum oxygen consumption rate (Vmax) was calculated to be 8.8 and 33 gM/s
respectively, based on 60mg prot/gg DNA ([8]) and 27.6 nmolO2/mg protein/min. Culture
medium at the inlet to the construct was assumed fully saturated with atmospheric oxygen with an
oxygen concentration of 222.47 gM.
In another case, oxygen concentration profiles were compared in a 0.5 cm thick tissue
construct with 100pm channel diameter, 00gm wall-to-wall spacing perfused at the average
linear velocity per channel of 0.049cm/s or 0.135 cm/s (corresponding to 0.1 lml/min and 0.31
ml/min of bulk flow respectively) with culture medium supplemented with 0, 3.2, 6.4 vol% PFC
emulsion (0, 10 or 20% of OxygentTM). Such a fine channel array was not produced
experimentally due to the limitations associated with the laser cutting/engraving system, but
represent the target value in scaffold design necessary for high oxygen concentration in the tissue
space. Cell density in the tissue space was set to be physiological (108cells/cm3, Vmax=33iM/s,
Km=6.875gM). At the low volume fractions of PFC used in the simulation (=0.033-0.064) the
viscosity of PFC supplemented culture medium is maintained at the values comparable to that of
water (-lcp, [16]). The average velocity of culture medium was chosen so that the shear stress at
the walls was less than ldyn/cm2which is below the range (1.6-3.3 dyne/cm2) reported to induce
decreased viability in hybridoma and human embryonic kidney cells [17, 18].

Important dimensionless numbers
In order to simplify the mathematical model, Re and Pe numbers were calculated for all
investigated channel geometries and average velocities. The low values of Re and velocity
entrance lengths (Table 8.3) indicate that the flow was laminar and fully developed over most of
130
the length of the channel for 0.2 and 0.5 cm thick constructs. Therefore, the velocity profile v(r)
in conservation equations is given by:
v:(r) =2 U(I -rQRj2) (13)
Table 8.3 Important dimensionless numbers, mass transport and velocity entrance
length for all of the channel dimensions and average velocities investigated.
Relatively high values of Pe numbers imply that axial diffusion within the channel can
be neglected. For the conditions investigated experimentally (Table 8.3 first row) approximately
one half of the 0.2 cm thick construct was within the mass transfer entrance length. For this
reason it was impractical to describe the transport within the channel with a single mass transfer
coefficient.
Assumption validation for model parameters:
To justify the assumption of uniform oxygen concentration within PFC droplets and the
local equilibrium between PFC and aqueous phase at every point along the channel length, the
following processes have to be considered (Figure 8.1C):
1. Diffusion of oxygen inside the PFC droplet
2. Diffusion of oxygen from the PFC droplet to the surrounding aqueous phase of
culture medium.
3. Transport of oxygen from the bulk fluid to the tissue wall.
There is a gradient in oxygen concentration from the center of PFC droplet to the
drop/medium interface (AC 1), followed by the drop at the aqueous phase and a gradient through
the boundary layer (AC2) (Figure 8.1D). The ratio of these two concentration differences is
proportional to the Biot number [0,pg83]:

resistance to internal diffusion can be neglected.

The value of the channel Sherwood number was calculated for the: constant
concentration at the channel wall and constant flux at the wall. Since there is consumption of
oxygen at the channel wall the real boundary condition is mixed or Robin boundary condition and
the Sherwood number for this case falls in between the values obtained for constant flux and
constant concentration boundary condition. [10, pg.392].
To estimate Sh. up to the value of mass transfer entrance length (0.128mm) Eq. 23 and
Eq. 24, both applicable for the fully developed velocity profile, were used for constant
concentration and constant flux boundary condition respectively [10, pg. 384].

Beyond the mass transport entrance length (which is most of the construct for the 100gm

concentration and constant flux boundary condition respectively. The resulting values, all bellow

Consequently since Sht is many orders of magnitude less than 106 over most of the tube length at
the conditions investigated, AC2<<AC3over most of the tube length except very near to the
entrance where Sht--oc. Since AC<<AC 2than also ACt<<AC 3.Therefore, absorbance from the
PFC droplets into the aqueous phase is not the rate limiting step and local equilibrium can be
assumed at every point in the channel.
Numerical Method
Finite element method was used to solve the model with a commercial software package
FEMLAB (Comsol Inc., Burlington, MA) using built in 2D variable general form PDE. This PDE
template takes into account diffusion in both axial and radial direction in the channel.
Symmetry planes (Neumann boundary condition) were placed at the boundaries between
the domains and in the channel center-line. (Figure 8.1B). Dirichlet boundary condition was
imposed at the entrance and at the exit of the tissue construct. Since Pe number for this problem
was high, the transport was convection dominated in the channel subdomain. In order to stabilize
the discrete scheme streamline diffusion was added.
Since the source term in the convection-diffusion equation follows Michaelis-Menten
kinetics and is non-linear, the equations had to be solved using a stationary non-linear solver.
The algorithm solves the equation by an affine invariant form of the damped Newton method.
The Jacobian that is needed for the nonlinear iterations is set to be calculated exactly using
symbolic math toolbox. The maximum number of iterations was set to 25, minimum step size to
104and the tolerance for convergence is set to 10 .The convergence was tested by refining the
mesh.
134
In order to validate the model, oxygen profile in the center (L/2) of the tissue space with
cells respiring at Vmax, was compared to the one dimensional analytical solution with zero order
kinetics.
As demonstrated in governing equations (Eq. 10) and Table 8.5, PFC emulsion
contributes to the enhancement of mass transfer by increasing effective diffusivity, and the
convective term (apparent average veolicty). To illustrate this effect, simulations were performed
in a densely packed channel array (100gm channel diameter, 100 gm wall-to-wall spacing),
perfused at 0.135cm/s with culture medium supplemented with 0, 3.2 % and 6.4 % of PFC
emulsion. For simplicity the oxygen consumption in the tissue region was assumed to follow zero
order kinetics at 18gM/s (corresponding to cell density of -0.5 106cells/cm3). In each case
contribution of effective diffusivity alone, convective term alone and the combined effect of both
tenrms was investigated. Volume averaged and minimum oxygen concentration as well as the
mixing-cup culture medium concentration at the outlet were compared.

concentration was calculatedfor a densely packed channel array (100 pm channel diameter, 100 pm wall-

follow zero order kinetics. The velocity of culture medium was 0.135cm/s. 0%PFC white bar, 3.2%PFC
gray bars. 62%PFC red bars. For 3.2 and 6.4% of PFC, contribution of effective diffusivity alone was
compared to the contribution of convective term (vertical lines) and the combined effect of both terms
(horizontal lines).
The presence of PFC emulsion increased volume averaged and minimum oxygen
concentration in the tissue space as well as the bulk oxygen concentration at the outlet from
channel lumen. Volume averaged concentration in the tissue space increased roughly linearly
between 0 and 6.4 % of PFC emulsion (R2=0.9586). Minimum oxygen concentration in the tissue
135
space was increased by 19.5 times with addition of 3.2% PFC and 28 times by addition of 6.4%
PFC. Concurrently with the increase in the concentration in the tissue space, the concentration in
the culture medium increased as well. Addition of 3.2% -6.4%of PFC emulsion, increased the
outlet bulk medium aqueous concentration by 3.8-5 times respectively. As illustrated in the
Figure 8.2, -96.7-98.7% of the increase in the minimum and volume averaged oxygen
concentration can be contributed to the increase in the convective term, with the reminder of the
increase associate with the increase in effective diffusivity.
Model solution and validation
Oxygen distribution in one half of the tissue construct perfused with pure culture medium
and culture medium supplemented with PFC emulsion, as described in experimental section
(Table 8.2), is presented in Figure 8.3. A, B. The convergence was tested by increasing mesh
size from 141 triangles and 92 nodes to 9024 triangles and 4677 nodes, with no significant
changes in the oxygen profile (Figure 2C). n the last two refinements, the values agreed up to
four significant digits. In addition for zero order kinetics, the agreement between the simulated
oxygen profile in the tissue space (at L/2=0.lcm) and one dimensional analytical solution was in
three significant digits.

Oxygen profiles in the cardiac tissue constructs at experimental conditions
At the inlet of the tissue construct oxygen concentration in the channel lumen in the pure
culture medium and PFC supplemented culture medium is comparable and slightly lower in the
tissue space of the PFC group due to the higher cell density. At the height of 0.1cm the
concentrations become comparable in both lumen and the tissue space, while at 0.15 cm higher
oxygen concentration is observed in the lumen of the channel perfused with the PFC
supplemented culture medium compared to the pure culture medium. Finally at 0. 19cm higher
oxygen concentration is observed in both tissue space and the channel lumen for the PFC
supplemented culture medium, demonstrating the benefits of supplementation for thicker
constructs of higher cell density.
In the channel lumen, oxygen concentration in the aqueous phase of culture medium was
higher in the PFC supplemented medium compared to the pure medium However, in the tissue

Model predictions to aid in scaffold and culture conditions design
In order to determine conditions necessary to provide high oxygen concentration to the
tissue space with physiologically high cell density (1.108cells/cm3) and clinically relevant
thickness (0.5cm), we varied channel geometry, flow rate and fraction of PFC emulsion.
In one case channel geometry and flow rate corresponded to the experimentally obtained
values: 330pim channel diameter, 370 r.tm wall-to-wall spacing and 0.049cm/s average channel
velocity (Figure 8.4). At both cell densities investigated (0.27 10s cells/cm3and 1 IO8cells/cm3)
oxygen concentration in the channel lumen and the tissue space increased with the increase in the
circulating PFC fraction. For lower cell density at 6.4vol% PFC most of the tissue space had

oxygen concentration above 50 M, the value roughly corresponding to the venous blood.
However, at the high cell density most of the tissue space 50-100gmn away from the channel was
deprived of oxygen even at 6.4vol%PFC, in spite of the high oxygen concentrations present in the
channel lumen (Figure 8.4).
In order to address the problem, oxygen profiles were modeled in a channel array
consisting of channels 100gm in diameter and 100 gm wall-to-wall spacing at physiologically
high cell density I 108cells/cm3.At 0.049 cm/s oxygen concentration increased significantly in
both tissue space and channel lumen with the increase in circulating PFC emulsion from 0 to
6.4%% (Figure 8.5). However, in order to satisfy the demand of the entire 0.5 cm thick piece of
tissue, average fluid velocity had to be increased to 0.135 cm/s.
Oxygen transport improvements with the presence of PFC emulsion
The presence of 3.2-6.4 vol% OxygentTM(3.2-6.4 vol% PFC emulsion droplets)
increases the effective diffusivity of the culture medium by 9-18%. In addition convective term is
increased by 62-123% which is equivalent to the comparable increase in average fluid velocity.
Therefore, both the transport in axial and radial direction is improved compared to the presence of
the culture medium alone.

DISCUSSION:
We recently reported a biomimetic in vitro tissue culture system in which neonatal rat heart
cells were cultured on an elastic, highly porous scaffold with a parallel array of channels perfused
with culture medium supplemented with synthetic oxygen carrier (OxygentTMperfluorocarbon
emulsion). In this system, parallel channel array mimics the role of capillary network and the PFC
emulsion mimics the role of hemoglobin. Constructs perfused with unsupplemented culture
medium served as controls.
139
The main goal of this paper was to develop a steady state mathematical model that can be
used to predict oxygen concentration profiles in channel lumen and tissue space surrounding each
channel as a function of channel geometry, cell density, PFC emulsion content and flow rate. To
simplify equations of continuity for oxygen constant density and diffusivity were assumed in each
region. In addition it was assumed that there was no convection in the tissue space and that the
rate of absorption of oxygen from the PFC phase into aqueous phase was not rate limiting.
The construct was divided into array of cubic domains with a channel in the center and tissue
space surrounding the channel. One half of cross section of each domain with channel and tissue
space surrounding it was modeled in 2D. The main modes of mass transfer in the channel were
convection in axial direction and diffusion in radial direction based on the value of Peclet number
(Pe) (Table 8.3). Solubility of oxygen in the perfluorocarbon phase is governed by Henry's law.
Both axial and radial diffusion were taken into account in the tissue region. The consumption of
oxygen in the tissue region occurs by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Neumann boundary conditions
were imposed at symmetry planes (channel center, and half distance between the domains). For
all simulated cases Re was low and the flow was fully developed over most of the construct
length (Table 8.3).
The assumption of no convection in the tissue space was validated by experimental
evaluation of hydraulic permeability of empty channel-free biorubber scaffold. The obtained
tissue Pe was 0.19. As Matrigel/cell suspension was added to the scaffold it is reasonable that the
permeability of the scaffold and tissue Peclet number would decrease even further, justifying the
assumption of no convection through the tissue space.
Simulations for the densely packed channel array with zero order kinetics (Figure 8.2)
indicated that the presence of PFC emulsion at 3.2 and 6.4% significantly increased the volume
averaged and minimum concentration in the tissue space, while maintaining higher oxygen
concentration in the culture medium at the outlet. The majority of this increase (-98%) could be
contributed to the increase in the convective term.
When cultivated in the presence of PFC emulsion (5.4 vol% circulating), the constructs
had higher DNA and protein content (Chapter 7 Table 7.1) as well as the higher cells density
compared to the unsupplemeted culture medium (0.27- 108 cells/cm3vs. 0.42- 108cells/cm3). As a
result maximum oxygen consumption rate in the tissue space was higher for the PFC
supplemented vs. unsupplemented culture medium (10.5 vs. 8.8 gM/s respectively). The
comparison of modeled oxygen profiles in the tissue constructs (Figure 8.3) indicated that the
differences in oxygen concentration between PFC supplemented and pure culture medium were
more evident at higher construct thickness than closer to the entrance. Close to the entrance the
140
oxygen concentration in the tissue space was even slightly lower for the PFC supplemented
culture medium due to the higher cell density. At the entrance to the tissue construct the
concentration of oxygen in the aqueous phase of culture medium supplemented with PFC was
slightly lower (-10tM) than in the pure culture medium, indicating that longer gas exchanger
may be necessary for the complete reoxygenation of the culture medium supplemented with PFC
emulsion.
Along the length of the channel lumen oxygen concentration of the PFC supplemented
medium was higher than the non-supplemented (Figure 8.3) as well as in the tissue space at the
channel wall (Figure 8.3). At about 75 gm within the channel wall these differences became less
obvious and completely disappeared at x=0.035cm. Although oxygen supply to the construct was
increased by the addition of PFC emulsion, so was the number of surviving cells, resulting in the
increased oxygen consumption and approximately comparable oxygen concentration profiles over
most of the construct volume.
In order to determine the effect of PFC emulsion on the oxygen profile in tissue space
with the same cell density, we performed simulations at the existing channel geometry and flow
rate with 0, 3.2, and 6.4% PFC (Figure 8.4). The low value of investigated cell density was
0.27-108 cells/cm3and the high was physiologically relevant value of 1 108 cells/cm3.In both
cases, oxygen concentration in the channel lumen and tissue space increased with the increase in
the circulating PFC fraction. (Figure 8.4). However, at physiological cell densities, most of the
tissue space beyond 50 gim away from the channel wall was deprived from oxygen even at
6.4%PFC emulsion.
In order to remedy this problem at high cell densities (108cells/cm3), we investigated
oxygen profiles in a 0.5 cm thick channel array with 100gm channel diameter and 1Ojim wall-
to-wall spacing (Figure 8.5). The channel array used in our experiments (3301m channel
diameter and 370gm wall-to-wall spacing) is the finest obtainable in 0.2cm thick scaffolds using
the existing laser/cutting engraving system. In order to make thick scaffold (0.5 cm) with a fine
channel array (100gm) the machining will have to be modified. Although the oxygen
concentration in the tissue space increased considerably with the increase of circulating PFC
concentration from 0-6.4%, we had to increase the flow rate in order to provide enough oxygen
for the entire 0.5 cm thick construct. At our best conditions (0.135cm/s and 6.4%PFC) the oxygen
is not depleted at any point in the scaffold and the minimum concentration of 33jiM is
approximately five times above the Km.
141
According to the developed mathematical model, addition of PFC emulsion increased
convective term by the factor of (K-l)+, which is equivalent to the same increase in the average
velocity. Therefore, at the given average velocity, culture medium with PFC will improve
transport in the axial direction and support thicker construct, compared to the pure culture
medium. In addition, higher oxygen solubility and diffusivity of PFC droplets, increased effective
diffusivity of the supplemented culture medium by 9-18% compared to the pure culture medium,
therefore improving the radial transport of oxygen.
In summary, a steady state mathematical model for oxygen concentration profile in a
tissue constructs with a parallel channel array was developed as a function of concentration of
PFC emulsion channel geometry, flow rate and cell density. The model was solved for a set of
experimentally obtained conditions and used to predict oxygen concentration profiles in
constructs of clinically relevant thickness (0.5 cm) and physiologically high cell densities. For the
experimentally relevant parameters, the obtained cell density was higher when constructs were
perfused with the PFC supplemented culture medium, leading to the increased oxygen
consumption rate. Therefore, in spite of the improved delivery, the oxygen concentration profiles
were comparable in the tissue space of the constructs cultivated with pure and PFC supplemented
culture medium. The concentration in the channel lumen was higher in the PFC supplemented
medium. At identical cell density the concentration in the tissue space increased with the increase
in PFC concentration, flow rate and for finer channel arrays.

9. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK
Summary
This Ph.D. thesis was motivated by the need to create functional cardiac tissue equivalents for
the repair of impaired myocardium or studies of normal and pathological tissue function in vitro.
Current tissue engineering approaches have been limited by diffusional oxygen supply, lack of
physical stimuli and absence of multiple cell types characteristic of the native myocardium.
We hypothesized that functional, clinically sized (1-5 mm thick), compact cardiac constructs
with physiologic cell densities can be engineered in vitro by mimicking cell microenvironment
present in the native myocardium in vivo. The main factors in the myocardial environment include:
high cell density (108cells/cm3), multiple cell types, convective-diffusive oxygen supply with the
presence of natural oxygen carrier, hemoglobin, and excitation-contraction coupling. During the
course of this PhD thesis each of these factors was tested independently. The obtained results were
summarized in six chapters (Chapter 3-8) of this thesis.
Since cardiac myocytes have limited ability to proliferate we developed methods of
seeding cells at high densities while maintaining their viability (Chapter 3). This was achieved via
a two step approach, in which cell/Matrigel suspension was inoculated onto collagen sponges
followed by the alternating flow direction medium perfusion. Cultivation of cardiac constructs in
the presence of convective-diffusive oxygen transport in perfusion bioreactors, maintained
aerobic cell metabolism, viability and uniform distribution of cells expressing cardiac markers
(Chapter 4). To improve cell morphology and functional tissue assembly cardiac constructs were
cultivated with electrical stimulation of contraction in a physiologically relevant regime (Chapter
5). Orderly excitation-contraction coupling enabled formation of tissue with elongated cells
aligned in parallel and with organized ultrastructure remarkably similar to the one present in the
native heart. To investigate the effect of multiple cell types on the properties of engineered
cardiac tissue cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes were cultivated synchronously, separately
or serially (pretreatment of scaffolds with fibroblasts followed by the addition of myocytes)
(Chapter 6). Pretreatment remarkably improved contractile response as well as biochemical and
morphological properties of engineered cardiac tissue, most likely due to the deposition of
extracellular matrix (e.g. collagen) and soluble factors that enhanced functional tissue assembly
after addition of myocytes. Finally, in order to mimic capillary structure, cardiac fibroblasts and
myocytes were co-cultured on a scaffold with a parallel channel array that was perfused with
culture medium supplemented with synthetic oxygen carrier (perfluorocarbon, PFC, emulsion).
The presence of PFC emulsion resulted in significantly higher cell density and improved
contractile properties compared to the constructs cultivated in the culture medium alone,
145
presumably by increasing total oxygen content. (Chapter 7). Mathematical model of oxygen
transport indicated that the release of oxygen from PFC particles was not rate limiting, and that
the improvements in the oxygen transport were due to the increase in effective diffusivity of the
culture medium supplemented with PFC emulsion and increase in the convective term
proportional to the fraction of PFC particles. (Chapter 8)
In summary, each of the biomimetic factors applied alone, remarkably improved the
properties of engineered cardiac tissue compared to the conventional tissue culture methods. All
of the important structural and functional characteristics of the engineered cardiac tissue, high cell
density, elongated cell morphology parallel cell alignment and contractility, were successfully
addressed.
Future work
In this PhD thesis each of the listed biomimetic factors was tested independently. In the
future work, it is necessary to combine these individual factors, in a single system. As a first step
it is necessary to develop a bioreactor that would provide medium perfusion and electrical
stimulation at the same time. Medium perfusion would enable high cell density and uniform
distribution, while electrical stimulation would enable modulation of the level of cell
differentiation and parallel cell alignment. The first step in the design of such a bioreactor would
be a design of perfusion chamber with multiple wells for tissue construct, and electrodes built in
the walls of the chamber (top-to-bottom or side-to-side depending on the desired cell orientation).
Uniform medium flow can be provided by a porous platen of high resistance. In addition in such a
system, mechanical stimulation can be provided by the pulsatile medium flow in conjunction with
the pinch valve at the outlet from the perfusion chamber. Such a bioreactor would be useful in
basic studies of the interaction between, electrical, mechanical and biochemical stimuli.
The cell co-culture can be expanded to include the third major cell type present in the
native myocardium: endothelial cells. Channeled scaffolds, pretreated with fibroblasts can be
seeded with cardiomyocytes and cultivated in the advanced bioreactor presented above. When the
desired level of parenhymal tissue formation is achieved, endothelial cell can be injected to line
the channels as described [1].
All of the work in this PhD, thesis has been performed with neonatal rat ventricular cells
as a model system. Our overall goal is however, to repair human hearts and provide in vitro
systems for study of human myocardium. Since adult cardiomyocytes have limited ability to
proliferate [2] it is necessary to find autologous human cell source. It has been demonstrated
recently, that with appropriate biochemical treatment bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [3]
and cells from adipose tissue [4, 5] can express some markers of cardiomyocyte phenotype. As a
146
part of future work it would be useful to study if undifferentiated cells from the autologous
sources listed above can be turned into heart tissue using the biomimetic system presented in this
thesis. Undifferentiated cells can be placed into 3D environment using the described gel
inoculation system and collagen sponges, followed by cardiac-like electrical stimulation. As
advanced bioreactors become available a range of mechanical, biochemical and electrical stimuli
can be applied simultaneously, thereby potentially improving the level of differentiation.
Finally, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of engineered cardiac tissue in the
long term and short term in vivo implantation studies. Previous implantation studies, showed
moderate improvement and functional integration of the engineered cardiac constructs with the
host myocardium [6-8]. Part of the problem may be that when implanted cardiac constructs do not
communicate electrically with the rest of heart tissue. Contractions are relayed passively, instead
by the action potential propagation. In the future work, it is necessary to check if pacing of the
cardiac patch upon implantation via a pace-maker-like device would enhance the implantation
outcome, and improve electro-mechanical coupling with the host myocardium.
Although, the routine treatment of impaired myocardium via tissue engineering may not
