Abstract
Pneumatic reactors are an important class of bioreactors widely used in biotechnological processes. The growing interest in these
reactors is mainly related to their good mass transfer capacity, as well as lower operating costs, due to the simple mechanical
structure. Knowledge of the transport phenomena and hydrodynamics of bioreactors is important to enable denition of the
best bioreactor model and operating conditions for a specic bioprocess. Several performance parameters are used to evaluate
bioreactors, with the imposed shear being one of the most dicult to quantify. For stirred tanks, the fragmentation of microor-
ganisms has been well correlated with a hydrodynamic parameter called the \energy dissipation/circulation function" (EDCF).
However, there have been no estimates of the EDCF for pneumatic bioreactors. The present work proposes a methodology to
estimate the EDCF for dierent pneumatic bioreactors and operating conditions. The diculty in estimating the EDCF for
pneumatic bioreactors is in dening the volume of higher energy dissipation. Here, this was achieved employing the maximal
shear rate obtained using computational uid dynamics simulations. The estimated volume was validated by comparing pellet
fragmentation in conventional and pneumatic bioreactors, under conditions that led to similar EDCF values.
1. INTRODUCTION
Airlift reactors are an important class of multiphase contactors that are widely used in the chemical industry,
biotechnological processes, and biological wastewater treatment. The growing interest in these reactors is
mainly related to their mixing capacity and heat and mass transfer characteristics, as well as lower design
and operating costs, due to the simple mechanical structure and absence of moving parts (Behin, 2010).
Understanding of the transport phenomena involved in the operation of airlift bioreactors is very important
in order to allow denition of the best operating conditions for a specic bioprocess. The most common
performance parameters used for this task are the liquid circulation velocity, mixing time, gas holdup,
bubble diameter, overall oxygen transfer coecient (k La), and shear rate ( _ ) (de Jesus, Neto, & Maciel,
2017). Among all these variables, k La and _have been extensively applied to characterize cultivations in
airlift bioreactors, while also enabling comparison of the performances of stirred tank and airlift bioreactors
in the production of bioproducts (Thomasi, Cerri, & Badino, 2010; Michelin et al., 2013, Cerri & Badino,
2012).
Airlift bioreactors usually require less energy than stirred tank reactors, under similar oxygen transfer con-
ditions. The turbulence of two-phase ow in airlift bioreactors not only provides favourable conditions for

Data may be preliminary.mass transfer, but can also be used for suspending solid particles (Trager, Qazi, Onken, & Chopra, 1989).
Despite the importance of power input in the characterization of bioreactors, few studies have described
its eect on the performance of cultivations in airlift bioreactors (de Jesus et al., 2017; Contreras, Garcia,
Molina, & Merchuk, 1999; Grima, Chisti, & MooYoung, 1997; Merchuk & Berzin, 1995; Merchuk & Benzvi,
1992). The main application of this concept is focused on modelling the liquid circulation velocity (Mendes
& Badino, 2016; Kilonzo, Margaritis, & Bergougnou., 2010; Hwang & Cheng, 1997; Bando, Fujimori, Ter-
azawa, Yasuda, & Nakamura, 2000; Calvo & Leton, 1991; Calvo, Leton, & Arranz, 1991; Chisti, Halard &
Mooyoung, 1988). In contrast, the power input has been extensively used to evaluate the performance of
cultivations in stirred tank bioreactors.
Smith, Lilly, and Fox (1990) evaluated the eect of agitation on the fragmentation of Penicillium chrysogenum
in bench (9-L) and pilot (90-L) scales of conventional bioreactors equipped with Rushton turbine impellers.
Firstly, an unsuccessful attempt was made to correlate the penicillin production rate to the impeller tip
speed, for both scales. Subsequently, it was observed that the breakup frequency (1/t C) could be used to
characterize the penicillin production rate. As a result, a correlation was proposed where the turbulence
dissipation rate ( =P
D3) was combined with the frequency of exposure of the mycelium to the high shear
zone (breakup frequency, 1 =tC), dening what is currently called the energy dissipation/circulation function
(EDCF) ( Equation 1 ).
EDCF =P
D31
tC(1)
Once the energy dissipation/circulation function concept had been dened, it started to be widely used
to correlate mycelium fragmentation to operating conditions in conventional bioreactors. Makagiansar,
Shamlou, Thomas, and Lilly (1993) successfully correlated the EDCF to the specic penicillin production
rate obtained in bench (5-L), pilot (100-L), and industrial scale (1,000-L) stirred tank bioreactors equipped
with Rushton turbine impellers.
Justen, Paul, Nienow, and Thomas (1996) modied the denition of EDCF by including a geometrical factor
(k) (Equation 2 ), whereby the relevant volume depends on the type of impeller and the volume swept
by it while rotating, allowing the evaluation of dierent impeller geometries (paddle, Rushton turbine, and
pitched blade). An excellent correlation was observed between this new EDCF concept and morphological
parameters such as the mean total hyphal length and mean projected area, obtained from P. chrysogenum
cultivations.
EDCF =P
kD31
tC
(2)
Amanullah et al. (2000) determined EDCF values for several impeller models (Rushton turbine, Prochem
Maxow T, pitched blade, paddle, propeller, and Intermig set) during fragmentation tests of P. chrysogenum
and Aspergillus oryzae , also observing a dependency among EDCF values and morphological parameters.
The selection of a bioreactor model for application in an aerobic bioprocess should consider not only its oxygen
transfer capability, but also the shear environment provided by it, since biochemical processes are extremely
sensitive to the shear intensity, when fragile animal cells, plant cells, and lamentous microorganisms are
used (Contreras et al., 1999). Excessive shear can cause cell damage, leading to viability loss and even cell
disruption or disintegration, so bioreactors should provide moderate or low shear, necessitating understanding
of the shear distribution within the system.
Although there are some methodologies available for estimating the shear rates in conventional bioreactors
(Campesi, Cerri, Hokka, & Badino, 2009; Buo et al., 2016; Bustamante, Cerri, & Badino, 2013) and
pneumatic bioreactors (Cerri, Futiwaki, Jesus, Cruz, & Badino, 2008; Thomasi et al., 2010; Nishikawa,
Kato, & Hashimoto, 1977; Schumpe & Deckwer, 1987; Shi, Riba, & Angelino, 1990; Al-Masry & Chetty,
1996; Merchuk & Benzvi, 1992; Merchuk & Berzin, 1995; Grima et al., 1997), they involve indirect estimation
of this parameter. The application of the EDCF concept can ll this gap, since it considers the specic power

Data may be preliminary.consumption, which is a variable associated with the shear level, and also takes into account the frequency
of exposure to the high shear environment.
The nonexistence of the energy dissipation/circulation function for other types of bioreactors makes it dicult
to compare the performance of the bioreactors in terms of the degree of cellular fragmentation. Therefore, the
present work proposes a new way to estimate the EDCF for pneumatic bioreactors, considering two dierent
approaches, namely fragmentation similarity and computational uid dynamics simulations, for which very
similar values were obtained.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Bioreactors and experimental conditions
A 4-L conventional stirred tank bioreactor (STB) (New Brunswick Scientic, USA) was evaluated in this
study. This device was equipped with two dierent dual-impeller congurations, either two Rushton turbines
(RT-RT) or two Elephant Ear impellers (EEDP-EEUP). These impellers associations, with diameters of 0.076
and 0.080 m for RT and EE, respectively, were employed previously by Buo, Esperan ca, Farinas, and Badino
(2020b).
Three dierent 5-L pneumatic bioreactor models were used in the present work: bubble column (BC),
concentric-duct airlift (CDA), and split airlift (SA). These devices were equipped with dierent spargers:
84-hole cross-type spargers for the BC and CDA bioreactors, and a 76-hole wing-type sparger for the SA
bioreactor. The sparger holes were 0.5 mm in diameter and were spaced 5 mm apart.
The bioreactor models are illustrated in Figure 1 (stirred tank bioreactor and impellers) and Figure 2
(pneumatic bioreactors). The detailed geometric dimensions are presented in Table 1 .
The pneumatic bioreactors were evaluated for specic air ow rates ( air) ranging from 1 to 5 vvm, while
the stirred tank bioreactor was operated at an impeller speed ( N) of 400 rpm and airof 0.4 vvm.
Figure 1.
Figure 2.
Table 1.
2.2. Energy dissipation/circulation function (EDCF)
The energy dissipation/circulation function (EDCF) is an important hydrodynamic parameter and can be
related to possible damage that a bioreactor may cause to cells (Buo et al., 2020b; Smith et al., 1990;
Hardy, Augier, Nienow, Beal, & Ben Chaabane, 2017). For stirred tank bioreactors, this parameter can be
obtained considering the gassed power consumption ( Pg) in a region of higher energy dissipation and shear
stress, the volume VC, which is close to the impellers, and the circulation time (t C) (Equation 3 ).
EDCF =Pg
VC1
tC
(3)
For stirred tanks, VCis normally related to the impeller diameter and geometry. However, for pneumatic
bioreactors, no denition or estimation for this volume of higher energy dissipation was found in the literature.
Despite this apparent lack, methods have been reported for estimation of the other two variables, Pgand
tC, in pneumatic bioreactors. These are also important variables for the estimation of EDCF and have been
determined experimentally for the pneumatic devices presented in Section 2.1 .
The circulation time ( tC) was obtained using the method described by Vasconcelos et al. (2003), which
consists of monitoring the time required for a spherical particle with the same density as the liquid to
circulate through the bioreactor. A digital camera (Nikon D5200) and free VideoPad software were used for
lming and analysis of the results, respectively.

2.3. Evaluation of shear rate ( _) in pneumatic bioreactors
Based on behaviour observed in stirred tank bioreactors, it is expected that the region of higher energy
dissipation should also exhibit a high degree of shear. This region has been described using a characteristic
volume (VC), although values have not yet been established for pneumatic bioreactors.
In order to evaluate the axial shear rate prole in the pneumatic bioreactors, computational uid dynamics
(CFD) simulations were performed using the Euler-Euler approach and the mathematical modelling proposed
by Rodriguez, Valverde-Ramirez, Mendes, Bettega, and Badino (2015), which had successfully predicted
the liquid circulation velocity, global gas hold-up, and volumetric oxygen transfer coecient for the same
three pneumatic bioreactor geometries evaluated in the present work. Subsequently, Esperan ca et al. (2019)
extended this approach and estimated the average shear rate ( _ av) for the CDA bioreactor, based on the mean
interstitial liquid velocity and the interstitial liquid velocities in the riser and downcomer. More recently,
Esperan ca et al. (2020) extended the investigation to the other pneumatic bioreactors (SA and BC) and
showed that the highest shear rate values (maximum shear rate, _ max) occurred close to the sparger holes.
In the present work, this approach, which has provided satisfactory and consistent prediction of both global
and local variables, was used to obtain the shear rate values along the axial prole, for all the pneumatic
bioreactors.
The simulations were performed for the pneumatic bioreactors (BC, CDA, and SA) operating with three
dierent uids: distilled water ( L= 997 kg[?]m-3,L= 8.49[?]10-4Pa[?]s,= 0.072 N[?]m-1) and glycerol
solution (63% v[?]v-1,L= 1157 kg[?]m-3,L= 0.01 Pa[?]s, = 0.068 N[?]m-1) as Newtonian uids, and
xanthan gum solution (0.2% w[?]v-1,L= 1000 kg[?]m-3,K= 0.06 Pa[?]sn,n= 0.36,= 0.0708 N[?]m-1) as
a non-Newtonian uid. The specic air ow rates ( air) used were the same as those described in Section
2.1.
The computational geometry and numerical mesh were generated using GAMBIT v. 2.4.6 software and the
simulations were performed using Fluent 14.5 software.
2.4. Pellet fragmentation assays
In recent work, Buo, Esperanca, Bettega, Farinas, and Badino (2020a) used A spergillus niger pellets as a
microbial model to compare the fragmentation caused by dierent bioreactors. Subsequently, Buo et al.
(2020b) performed assays of A. niger pellet fragmentation with dierent STB impeller congurations. In the
present work, the same methodology described in the previous studies was applied for pellet fragmentation
in the STB, with the two impeller congurations, and in the CDA bioreactor. Pellet fragmentation assays
were performed during 4 h, with samples periodically removed for acquisition of stereoscopic images using
a Biofocus XT-3H-BI microscope, at a magnication of 7.5x. The images were treated using free ImageJ
software (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij), enabling determination of the temporal proles for the pellet projected area (A),
the variable used for fragmentation analysis. For each experimental point, more than 100 objects (pellets)
were analysed in two dierent samples, with the standard deviation used as the statistical parameter.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Denition of the characteristic volume ( V C) in pneumatic bioreactors

Data may be preliminary.The characterization of mycelium fragmentation, using the energy dissipation/circulation function (EDCF)
concept, requires knowledge of the characteristic volume ( VC), a region where a higher amount of energy
is dissipated. In stirred tank bioreactors, the swept volume around the impellers corresponds to the region
where this elevated energy dissipation is observed, in what is known as the impeller discharge zone (Li et
al., 2002). This is also the region where the maximum shear rate occurs (Li et al., 2002) ( Figure 3 ).
Figure 3.
According to Smith et al. (1990), \in the turbulent model of local isotropy it is the local energy dissipation
rate that determines the shear stress level". Liu et al. (2016) used the Euler-Lagrange CFD approach
to investigate the correlation between energy dissipation and shear rate/stress locations for stirred tank
bioreactors, monitoring the trajectories of random particles released in a 3-L stirred tank. The authors
dened the maximum shear stress and shear frequency (SSF) parameter, based on the EDCF concept.
According to Liu et al. (2016), the SSF is the ratio between the maximum shear stress ( max) and the time
required for a microorganism to be exposed to the high-shear condition (t C).
To the best of our knowledge, the EDCF concept has never been applied for the characterization of mycelial
fragmentation in pneumatic bioreactors (airlift and bubble column), despite there being well-established
methodologies for the determination of both gassed power consumption ( Pg) and circulation time ( tC).
The determination of EDCF values for pneumatic bioreactors requires knowledge of the characteristic volume
(VC). Several studies have reported that the region around the sparger holes presents the highest shear rate
(Esperanca et al., 2020; Pawar, 2017; Garcia, Paternina, Pupo, Bula, & Mare, 2014; Mavaddat, Mousavi,
Amini, Azargoshasb, & Shojaosadati, 2014). This maximum shear rate ( _ max) is the result of the high gas
injection velocity, which is determined by the sparger characteristics, considering the number and diameter
of the holes (Esperanca et al., 2020).
When the maximum shear rate ( _ max) is used to evaluate the shear environments in pneumatic and stirred
tank bioreactors, similar values are obtained, irrespective of bioreactor type, showing that the high shear
condition is dened by the operating conditions, rather than only by the type of bioreactor (Esperanca et
al., 2020).
Therefore, since there is a link between the locations of elevated energy dissipation and shear rate for stirred
tanks, in the case of pneumatic bioreactors, the highest amount of energy would be expected to be dissipated
close to the sparger holes.
In order to determine the characteristic volume ( VC) in pneumatic bioreactors, the axial shear rate prole
was obtained from the CFD results ( Figure 4a ). This prole started at the bottom of the bioreactor and
exhibited a peak of _ , whose value was around 3 orders of magnitude higher than the average value ( _ av),
for liquid heights (h) ranging from about 0.03 to 0.04 m ( Figure 4a ). A more accurate evaluation of the
characteristic volume ( VC) was performed using the derivative of the shear rate in relation to the liquid
height (d_=dh ), (Figure 4b ). TheVCstarted at the liquid height where d_=dh began to increase faster,
and ended at the liquid height where d_=dh approached zero again ( Figure 4b ). The calculation of VC
assumed a cylindrical volume surrounding the sparger holes, with the diameter taken as the sparger diameter
(Figure 3b ). This approach was applied for the entire set of pneumatic bioreactor models (bubble column,
concentric-duct airlift, and split airlift), types of uid (distilled water, glycerol solution, and xanthan gum
solution), and specic air ow rates ( air).
Figure 4.
Regardless of the pneumatic bioreactor model, uid type, and specic air ow rate, the axial prole of the
normalized shear rate ( _ =_av) showed that the highest shear rates occurred at liquid heights ( h) ranging
from 0.0220 to 0.0471 m ( Figure 5 ). This range of heights corresponded to volumes ranging from 57.9 to
106.5 cm3, which accounted for between 1.2 and 2.8% of the total liquid volume.
Figure 5.

Data may be preliminary.3.2 Estimation of EDCF for pneumatic bioreactors
Once the location of the characteristic volume ( VC) for pneumatic bioreactors had been identied and its
value had been estimated, the EDCF could be estimated for the 5-L pneumatic bioreactors ( Equation 5 ).
EDCF =Pg
VC1
tC
(5)
Knowing the experimental values of the dispersion density ( d) and gas-liquid dispersion height ( hd), the
gassed power consumption could be calculated using Equation 4. Subsequently, knowing Pgand the liquid
circulation time ( tC), and assuming an average characteristic volume of 75 cm3, based on the range from
57.9 to 106.5 cm3 (corresponding to 1.5% of the total liquid volume), the EDCF could be estimated. Figure
6shows the EDCF according to the specic air ow rate ( air) for the CDA and SA bioreactors operated
with Newtonian and non-Newtonian uids. In this case, the frequency term was considered to be the inverse
of the circulation time (1
tC), as indicated by Esperanca et al. (2020).
Figure 6.
For the concentric-duct airlift (CDA) bioreactor, the EDCF ranged from 1.0 to 9.1 kW.m-3.s-1, while for
the split airlift (SA) bioreactor it varied from 0.71 to 6.8 kW.m-3.s-1. Comparing the two airlift models, the
EDCF values were slightly higher for the CDA device, compared to the SA system. Increase of the specic
air ow rate acted to increase the EDCF, due to the combined eects of a shorter circulation time ( tC) and
higher gassed power input ( Pg).
Despite these results being estimates of EDCF, the values seemed to be reasonable, since they were of the
same order of magnitude as EDCF values reported for stirred tanks ( Table 2 ). Therefore, the estimated
value ofVCalso seemed to be appropriate.
It is important to highlight that in the scale-up of stirred tank bioreactors, lower specic power inputs are
required, due to \cost considerations and practical restraints on motor, gearbox, and bearing design, among
other" (Justen et al. 1996), resulting in longer circulation times. Hence, lower ECDF values are expected
for larger stirred tanks, as the literature shows ( Table 2 ).
Table 2.
3.3 Validation of V C
estimation using fragmentation assays
In order to validate the pneumatic bioreactor characteristic volume ( VC) values estimated by CFD analysis,
pellet fragmentation assays were performed using the 5-L concentric-duct airlift bioreactor at 5 vvm. For
this operating condition, the expected EDCF values were in the range from 7.0 to 9.1 kW.m-3.s-1, depending
on the uid characteristics ( Figure 6 ).
Pellet fragmentation assays were also performed using a 4-L stirred tank bioreactor at 400 rpm and 0.4 vvm,
with dierent dual-impeller combinations: Rushton turbine/Rushton turbine (RT-RT), and Elephant Ear
down-pumping/Elephant Ear up-pumping (EEDP-EEUP). The EDCF values for these impeller congura-
tions and operating conditions were 5.3 and 5.0 kW.m-3.s-1, respectively (Buo et al., 2020b). Figure 7
shows the variation of the normalized pellet projected area ( A=A 0) during the fragmentation assays performed
using the stirred tank bioreactor (STB) with two dierent impeller combinations (RT-RT and EEDP-EEUP)
and the concentric-duct airlift (CDA) bioreactor.
Figure 7.
The results showed that despite some dierences in the pellet fragmentation proles, the nal A=A 0values
were very similar for all the bioreactors, with an average value of 0.77. This indicated that for these
bioreactors, under the operating conditions employed, the fragmentations were equivalent.

Data may be preliminary.Since the EDCF has been applied to describe the cellular fragmentation in stirred tanks, it was expected that
the EDCF values would be the same for the CDA and STB systems, under the abovementioned operating
conditions ( Equation 6a ).
EDCF CDA= EDCF STB(6a)
Considering an average EDCF value of 5.15 kW.m-3.s-1for the stirred tank with RT-RT and EEDP-EEUP
impeller congurations, and the general EDCF denition ( Equation 3 ), then:
EDCF CDA=Pg
VC1
tC= 5:15kW
m3s
(6b)
Substituting in Equation 6b the gassed power input ( Pg) value of 1.64 W ( Equation 4 ) for the CDA
bioreactor operating at 5 vvm and the circulation time ( tC) of 3.1 s (Mendes & Badino, 2016), the char-
acteristic volume ( VC) in which there was the highest energy dissipation was calculated as being 103 cm3.
This volume represented about 2.1% of the liquid volume in the CDA bioreactor and was within the VC
range estimated using CFD simulation (from 57.9 to 106.5 cm3). This proximity between the VCvalues
obtained by the two methodologies evidenced the applicability of the analytical approach proposed in the
present work.
The STB swept volumes were calculated based on the geometric characteristics of the dual-impeller con-
gurations, for comparison with VCof the CDA system. The characteristic volumes for the STB equipped
with dierent impeller combinations were higher than those observed for the CDA bioreactor ( Table 3 ),
corresponding to about 11.9% (average value) of the liquid volume. Hence, despite the higher power input
observed for stirred tank bioreactors, this amount of energy is dissipated in a greater volume, resulting in
similar EDCF values.
Table 3
The establishment, in this work, of the EDCF calculation for pneumatic bioreactors makes it possible to
estimate this variable for dierent operating conditions, allowing comparison of lamentous microorganism
cultivations in pneumatic and conventional bioreactors.
CONCLUSIONS
The energy dissipation/circulation function (EDCF) was successfully estimated, for the rst time, for pneu-
matic bioreactors operating under dierent conditions. The values obtained were of the same order of
magnitude as EDCF values for stirred tanks reported in the literature. A critical point in the methodol-
ogy was denition of the characteristic volume ( VC) of higher energy dissipation, which was obtained by
analysing the region of maximal shear rate. This approach proved to be satisfactory, since similar EDCF
values were obtained for conventional and pneumatic bioreactors operating under conditions that resulted
in similar A. niger fragmentation. The present work introduces a new methodology for calculation of an
important parameter for pneumatic bioreactors, allowing comparisons to be made of the fragmentation of
lamentous microorganisms in dierent bioreactors.
