Abstract
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) participates in the detoxiﬁcation of many environmental quinones
and related compounds. Recent studies have suggested that individuals with a polymorphism in NQO1 (NQO1*2),which results in a decrease (heterozygous, NQO1*1 /*2) or a total loss (homozygous, NQO1*2 /*2) of NQO1, may be
at increased risk for the development of leukemias. Previous studies have failed to detect NQO1 in freshly aspiratedbone marrow including Ficoll-puriﬁed mononuclear cells and puriﬁed CD34
+hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. In
these studies we examined human bone marrow core biopsies by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodiesdirected against NQO1. These studies revealed that NQO1 was expressed in human bone marrow but expression ofNQO1 was limited to bone marrow endothelium and adipocytes. To conﬁrm the expression of NQO1 in bone marrowendothelial cells we examined an immortalized human bone marrow endothelial cell line (HBMEC-60) for NQO1protein expression. Immunoblot analysis and an activity assay conﬁrmed the expression of NQO1 in HBMEC-60.These data demonstrate that NQO1 is present in human bone marrow. The increased risk of leukemia associated witha deﬁcit in NQO1 levels due to the NQO1*2 polymorphism may reﬂect impaired quinone detoxiﬁcation and anincreased susceptibility of endothelial cells in bone marrow to environmental insults. © 2001 Elsevier Science IrelandLtd.

1. Introduction
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1,
DT-diaphorase, EC 1.6.99.2) is a cytosolicﬂavoenzyme which catalyzes the two-electron re-duction of a broad range of substrates. NQO1 is
classiﬁed as a detoxiﬁcation enzyme primarily be-cause of its ability to reduce quinone substratesdirectly to their hydroquinone derivatives bypass-ing the redox-cycling semiquinone.
A polymorphism in NQO1 has been character-
ized (NQO1*2), a C to T substitution at position609 of the human NQO1 cDNA that codes for aproline to serine amino acid change at position

187 of the protein (Traver et al., 1997). Geno-
type –phenotype studies have shown those indi-
viduals homozygous for the NQO1*2polymorphism are de ﬁcient in NQO1 due to en-
hanced proteasomal degradation of the mutantprotein (Siegel et al., 1999, 2001). Epidemiologicaldata from benzene exposed workers has demon-strated an increased risk of developing benzenepoisoning (hemotoxicity) with the homozygousNQO1*2 genotype in agreement with the pro-posed protective role of NQO1 against benzenederived quinones (Rothman et al., 1997). Re-cently, low NQO1 activity has been associatedwith increased risk of de novo acute myeloidleukemia in adults (Smith et al., 2001). A hypoth-esis has been proposed where benzene metabolitesphenol and hydroquinone, derived mainly fromdiet and gastrointestinal ﬂora activity, are causal
factors in de novo leukemia (Smith et al., 2001).
Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies
revealed that NQO1 is widely expressed in humantissues with high levels of protein detected inepithelium and endothelium (Siegel et al., 1998;Siegel and Ross, 2000). Since NQO1 has beenimplicated to protect against leukemia we exam-ined human bone marrow for the expression ofNQO1. In this study we have performed immuno-histochemical staining for NQO1 in paraf ﬁn-em-
bedded human bone marrow core biopsies andhave examined cultured human bone marrow en-dothelial cells for NQO1 protein and activity.
2. Materials and methods
2.1.Human tissues and cell lines
Five archival, B-5- ﬁxed, decalci ﬁed, paraf ﬁn-
embedded human bone marrow core biopsieswere obtained from the Department of Pathology,School of Medicine, University of ColoradoHealth Sciences Center. All biopsies were negativefor malignancy. All samples were anonymouswith no patient identi ﬁers. Immortalized human
bone marrow endothelial cell line (HBMEC-60)was obtained from Dr C.E. van der Shoot, Uni-versity of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Nether-lands. The HBMEC-60 cell line was grown onﬁbronectin coated tissue culture ware as previ-
ously described (Rood et al., 2000).
2.2.Antibodies
Anti-NQO1 monoclonal antibody (IgG1) secret-
ing hybridomas (clones A180 and B771) werederived from a BALB-c mouse immunized withpuriﬁed recombinant human NQO1 protein. Con-
trol (non-speci ﬁc IgG
1secreting) hybridoma
(clone C100) was derived from a BALB-c mouse.Hybridoma tissue culture supernatants were pre-pared as previously described (Siegel et al., 1999).Anti-NQO1 and control antibodies were diluted1:1 with 10 mM Tris –HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.4% (v /v) Tween-20 and 5% (w /v) non-fat
dry milk (blocking buffer). Detection of NQO1 byIHC was performed using avidin:biotinylated en-zyme complex (ABC) methodologies with DABstaining (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Vector DABSubstrate Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,CA).
2.3.Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue
sections (4 /p109m) cut from archival paraf ﬁn blocks.
Brieﬂy, sections were deparaf ﬁnized in xylene and
rehydrated through graded alcohols to distilledwater and then microwaved for two 5 min cyclesin 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0. Endogenousperoxidase activity was eliminated by placing sec-tions in 0.1% phenylhydrazine for 20 min. Im-munodetection of NQO1 was performed usingtissue culture supernatants from mouse hybri-doma clones A180 and B771. Negative controlswere performed utilizing supernatant from controlhybridoma clone C100. Serial sections of eachtissue sample were incubated with either anti-NQO1 or control antibodies diluted 1:1 in block-ing buffer for 1 h at 27 °C. Immunodetection was
performed using a horseradish peroxidase-basedVectastain Elite ABC Kit. 3,3-diaminobenzidine(DAB) and hydrogen peroxide were used as thehorseradish peroxidase substrates (brown stain-ing). Sections were then counterstained with he-matoxylin. Sections were photographed on aNikon FX microscope with Kodak Ektachrome64ﬁlm.D.Siegel et al ./Toxicology Letters 125 (2001) 93 –98 95
2.4.Immunoblot analysis
Immunoblot analysis of NQO1 was performed
as previously described (Siegel et al., 1999). HB-MEC-60 cells were grown to 80% con ﬂuencey in
T-75 ﬁbronectin coated ﬂasks. Endothelial cells
were released from the culture ﬂask following
treatment with trypsin, then washed in PBS andpelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resus-pended in 200 /p109lo f2 5m MT r i s –HCl, pH 7.4
containing 250 mM sucrose and 1 /p109Mﬂavin
adenine dinucleotide and sonicated on ice for 15 s.Sonicates were centrifuged at 10 000 ×gfor 5 min
to remove cellular debris. Following centrifuga-tion, the supernatant was recovered and proteinconcentrations were determined using the methodof Lowry (Lowry et al., 1951). Cellular proteinswere separated by 12% SDS-PAGE (minigel) andtransferred to 0.4 /p109m PVDF membrane in 25 mM
Tris, 192 mM glycine containing 20% (v /v)
methanol at 100 V for 1 h. Immunoblot analysisof NQO1 was performed using mouse anti-NQO1monoclonal antibodies (clones A180 /B771). Mem-
branes were incubated in 20 ml of blocking bufferwith anti-NQO1 hybridoma tissue culture super-natant diluted 1:200 for 1 h at 27 °C followed by
the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugatedgoat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) for 30 min. Proteinvisualization was performed using enhancedchemiluminescence (ECL) as described by themanufacturer.
2.5.NQO 1acti/p54ity assay
NQO1 speci ﬁc activity was determined spec-
trophotometrically in HBMEC-60 sonicates usingdicumarol-inhibitable reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP) as describedpreviously (Benson et al., 1980).
3. Results
Immunohistochemical staining of NQO1 in hu-
man bone marrow core biopsies has detectedNQO1 protein expression in bone marrow en-dothelial cells and adipocytes in bone marrowcore biopsies samples from ﬁve individuals. Im-munostaining of NQO1 was detected in endothe-
lial cells of larger arteries as well as in smallerarterioles and sinusoids (Fig. 1). No immunos-taining for NQO1 was observed in human bonemarrow core biopsies in control experiments whenanti-NQO1 antibodies were replaced with non-speci ﬁc antibodies (Fig. 1A). In addition to en-
dothelial cells immunostaining of NQO1 was alsodetected in adipocytes (Fig. 1F), however, nostaining for NQO1 was detected in hematopoieticcells.
To con ﬁrm the presence of NQO1 within bone
marrow endothelial cells we examined an immor-talized human bone marrow endothelial cell line(HBMEC-60) for NQO1 protein and activity. Im-munoblot analysis of HBMEC-60 cells con ﬁrmed
the presence of NQO1 protein (Fig. 2). NQO1speci ﬁc activity was measured in HBMEC-60 cells
at 617/p578(n=3) nmoles DCPIP per min per mg
protein. These data con ﬁrm that HBMEC-60 cells
express NQO1 at levels comparable to what hasbeen measured previously in epithelial cell lines.
4. Discussion
Immunohistochemical staining of NQO1 in hu-
man bone marrow core biopsies has revealed thatNQO1 is expressed in bone marrow endothelialcells. This is in agreement with immunohisto-chemical studies in other human tissues that haveshown NQO1 expression in endothelium. NQO1has been detected in vascular endothelium ofmany human tissues that we have examined(Siegel et al., 2001). NQO1 has also been detectedin specialized endothelial cells including cornealendothelium, (Schelonka et al., 2000) and alveolarcapillary endothelium (Siegel et al., 1998). Theabsence of immunostaining of NQO1 in hemato-poietic cells is in agreement with earlier experi-ments that failed to detect NQO1 protein inFicoll-puri ﬁed human bone marrow mononuclear
cells or puri ﬁed CD34
+hematopoietic progenitor
stem cells (Moran et al., 1999).
NQO1 expression has been shown to be protec-
tive against benzene-derived quinones and epi-demiological evidence suggests that decreased orabsent NQO1 activity results in an increased riskD.Siegel et al ./Toxicology Letters 125 (2001) 93 –98 96
of benzene or chemotherapy-induced leukemias as
well as de-novo leukemias in children and adults(Rothman et al., 1997; Larson et al., 1999;Wiemels et al., 1999; Smith et al., 2001). Themechanisms whereby NQO1 might protect againstleukemogensis have been puzzling since NQO1could not be detected in human bone marrow cellaspirates and puri ﬁed human bone marrow pro-
genitor cell populations (Moran et al., 1999) evenfrom individuals carrying the NQO1*1 /*1 (wild
type) genotype. In the case of benzene exposure,we offered a potential explanation that benzenemetabolites could induce NQO1 in human bonemarrow cells but increased NQO1 activity was not
observed in cells from individuals homozygous forthe NQO1*2 polymorphism (Moran et al., 1999),presumably due to rapid proteasomal degradationof the mutant NQO1 protein (Siegel et al., 2001).In this manuscript, we demonstrate that NQO1 ispresent in human bone marrow but is containedin cells that are not readily removed by aspirationtechniques such as bone marrow endothelial cells.The increased risk of de-novo and chemical in-duced leukemias associated with the NQO1*2polymorphism may, therefore, re ﬂect a lack of
NQO1 activity in bone marrow endothelial cells

ronmental insults.
The expression of NQO1 in bone marrow en-
dothelium is consistent with this enzyme playing arole in protection against leukemagenesis. Bonemarrow endothelial cells participate in the matu-ration of hematopoietic progenitor stem cellsthrough a combination of adhesion molecule in-teractions and cytokine secretions (Voermans etal., 2000; Mohle et al., 1998). The expression ofNQO1 in bone marrow endothelial cells may offerprotection against phenolic-derived quinones gen-erated within the endothelial cell or via the sur-rounding myeloperoxidase-rich hematopoieticprogenitor stem cells (Schattenberg et al., 1994).Alternatively, other NQO1-mediated protectivemechanisms may also be playing a role. NQO1has recently been reported to stabilize p53 (Asheret al., 2001), and such a stabilizing effect wouldpresumably be absent in individuals carrying theNQO1 *2 /*2 genotype due to the absence of
NQO1 protein.
In summary, immunohistochemical analysis of
human bone marrow core biopsy specimensshowed the presence of NQO1 in endothelial cellsand adipocytes. Substantial levels of NQO1 werealso detected in an immortalized human bonemarrow endothelial cell line. These data suggestD.Siegel et al ./Toxicology Letters 125 (2001) 93 –98 98
