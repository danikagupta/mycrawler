Professor David Williams, F.R.Eng         Curriculum Vitae  October  2017 	Career Overview  Professor Williams has had 49 years experience in the fields of biomaterials, medical devices and tissue engineering, gained during appointments at the University of Liverpool in the UK, and more recently at various positions around the world. During his career, he has published over 30 books and 420 papers: his latest book, Essential Biomaterials Science, was published by Cambridge University Press in June 2014. He was Editor-in-Chief of Biomaterials, the world’s leading journal in this field between 2000 and 2014. He has received the major awards from the US, European and Indian societies of biomaterials including the Founders Award of the US Society for Biomaterials in 2007, and received the prestigious Acta Biomaterialia Gold Medal in 2012. In 1999, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and is a Foreign Fellow of the Indian National Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, all in recognition of his contributions to engineering in medicine. He was global President of the Tissue Engineering & Regenerative Medicine International Society from 2013-2015.  He was a scientific advisor to several divisions of the European Commission during the 1990s and wrote several opinions on which European actions were taken. He has, over the last 20 years, given evidence in several major product liability and patent legal cases in the USA, Europe and Australia.  Professor Williams left the University of Liverpool, UK, in 2007, where he had been Head of Clinical Engineering, Director of the UK Centre for Tissue Engineering and Pro Vice Chancellor of the University. While retaining the title of Emeritus Professor at Liverpool, he is currently Professor and Director of International Affairs, Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine, North Carolina, USA. In addition, he is a Visiting Professor in the Christiaan Barnard Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Cape Town, South Africa. He is a Guest Professor, at Tsinghua University, Beijing, Advisory Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Honorary Professor of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Scientific Advisor at Nantong Key Laboratory for Neuroregeneration, and Scientific Advisor of Zhenjiang National University Science Park, all in China. He advises several industry parks in China concerning the attraction of overseas companies to medical technology opportunities in China.  He is Visiting Chair Professor of Biomedical Materials, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan. In Cape Town, along with Professor Peter Zilla, the current Chris Barnard Professor of Surgery, he has formed a company that will produce low cost but high technology medical devices that can be used with minimally invasive procedures to treat young adults in sub-Sarah Africa, who are suffering from rheumatic heart disease but currently have no therapies available to them. As Chairman and Founding Director of the company, Strait Access Technologies Pty Ltd, he has been responsible for raising over US$20 million and clinical trials / first-in-man implantations are imminent. The company employs around 30 engineers, scientists and clinicians and is located in Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town.  3
