 Abstract 
Textile manufacturing is one of the most polluting industrial activities not only because 
the large amount of water used during the process, but also due to the release of 
potentially toxic compounds, such as synthetic dyes . Due to consumer’s desire for color 
stability of the fibers during washing, perspiratio n and sun exposure, textile dyes have 
very stable chemical structure, thus they are diffi cult to be degraded. Depending on the 
class of the dyes, their loss in wastewaters can ra nge from 2% of the original 
concentration for basic dyes to as high as 50% for reactive dyes. Therefore, unlimited 
and uncontrolled use of such dyes can lead to serio us consequences for human health 
and ecological balance. This study assessed the let hal and sublethal effects of the textile 
dyes Direct Black 38 (DB38), Reactive Blue 15 (RB15 ), Reactive Orange 16 (RO16), 
and Vat Green 3 (VG3) on zebrafish embryos ( Danio rerio ) for 144 h postzfertilization 
(hpf). Neither of the studied dyes induced signific ant mortality at 8, 24, and 48 hpf. The 
highest RO16 dose significantly delayed or inhibite d the ability of zebrafish embryos to 
hatch from the chorion after 96 hpf. All dyes cause d defects in the gas bladder inflation 
of zebrafish larvae from 120 to 144 hpf. In this ex posure period, higher doses of DB38 
also induced curved spine, whereas VG3 led to yolk sac edema in zebrafish larvae. 
Based on the present data, we concluded that the te xtile dyes DB38, RB15, RO16, and 
VG3 induce malformation during the embryonic and la rval development of zebrafish, 
thus effluents discharge containing these compounds  into water bodies should be 
prevented.

 1.  INTRODUCTION 
Synthetic dyes have increasingly been used in the t extile and dyeing industries 
because of their ease and costzeffectiveness in syn thesis, firmness, high stability to light, 
temperature, detergent and microbial attack and var iety in color, when compared with 
natural dyes [1]. Based on the chemical structure o f the chromophoric group, synthetic 
dyes are classified into azo, nitro, anthraquinone,  triarylmethane, xanthene, 
heterocyclic, or indigo dyes. According to the mean s of application in the fiber, they can 
belong to the classes of reactive, acid, direct, ba sic, mordant, disperse, pigment, vat, 
anionic and ingrain, sulphur, solvent, disperse and  azoic dye [2,3]. 
In recent years, textile dyes are widely used all o ver the world, and textile industry 
plays an important role in nation’s economy [4]. Ho wever, dyes have generated much 
concern regarding their use, due to the reported to xic effects. Additionally, textile 
manufacturing consumes a considerable amount of wat er during the industrial 
processes, generating large quantities of textile w astewaters, which are discharged with 
dyes and other undesirable chemicals [5,6]. The amo unt of dye directly lost to the 
wastewater is dependent on the class of dye applied , varying from only 2% loss when 
using basic dyes to 50% loss when certain reactive dyes are used [6z8]. 
Due to their chemical structure, dyes are resistant  to chemical, physical, and 
biological treatments. In fact, many dyes are diffi cult to decolorize due to their complex 
structure and synthetic origin [6,9]. Thus, the dis charge of these compounds into the 
environment is undesirable not only for esthetic re asons but also because many dyes and 
their byproducts are toxic to both aquatic life and  humans [4,10z14].  
Considering the environmental impact caused by the discharge of these 
compounds, this study investigated the dyes Direct Black 38, Reactive Blue 15, Page 6 of 31 Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry

 Reactive Orange 16, and Vat Green 3, as models to e valuate aquatic toxicity induced by 
synthetic dyes. 
Direct dyes are the most popular class of dyes with  easy application, wide color 
range, and available low cost. Direct Black 38 (DB3 8) is a benzidinezbased azo dye, 
classified as carcinogenic by the International Age ncy for Research on Cancer (IARC) 
[15,16] due to its biotransformation to benzidine [ 17]. Most direct dyes have disazo and 
trisazo structures. Azo dyes are the largest class (60–70%) of dyes with the greatest 
variety of colors. The ubiquitous use makes them wi dely spread in aquatic systems, with 
great potential to bring adverse effects on aquatic  environment [4].  
Reactive dyes are frequently used in textile indust ries, specifically in cotton 
dyeing [6]. According to literature, Reactive Blue 15 (RB15), a copperzphtalocyanine 
dye, is moderately genotoxic for tadpoles Rana hexadactyla  [18] and toxic for Vibrio 
fischeri  [19]. Novotny et al. [20] have also observed that monoazo Reactive Orange 16 
(RO16) dye induces point mutations in TA98 and TA10 0 strains of Salmonella 
typhimurium  after metabolic activation. 
Vat dyes, which include indigo and anthraquinonezba sed dyes, are chemically 
complex compounds insoluble in water, which can be reduced into their leuco form by 
alkaline solution of sodium hydrosulfite before app lication to cotton and polymeric 
fibers [21,22]. Vat Green 3 (VG3), an anthraquinone  dye, is extremely toxic to the 
aquatic organisms Daphnia similis , Ceriodaphnia dubia and  Pseudokirchneriella 
subcapitata  [23]. 
Therefore, according to the toxicological studies, several textile dyes and textile 
effluents may affect the aquatic ecosystem, due to their toxic effects on Artemia sp  
[24,25] Vibrio fischeri  [20,24,26], green algae [20, 23],  Daphnia magna [24,27,28], Page 7 of 31 Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry

 Daphnia similis [14,23], and fish [4,24,29,30]. However, to date, t here is no information 
about the effects of these compounds on fish embryo s. 
This is the first study on the effects of textile d yes on zebrafish early life stages. 
Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) is a small freshwater tropical fish native to the  rivers of India 
and South Asia, with a short lifecycle, high fecund ity, short reproduction cycle, and 
with high number of eggs per spawning. Additionally , it has a rapid development and 
transparent eggs, which allow visualizing its devel opment [31z33]. This kind of fish has 
become one of the most important model organisms in  developmental biology of 
vertebrates and toxicology studies. Moreover, exper iments with embryos are considered 
as refinement to animal experiments, and offer a mu lticellular system integrating the 
interaction of various tissues and differentiation processes, when compared to 
experiments with cell lines [32,34]. 
In this context, the developmental toxicity of text ile dyes in zebrafish early life 
stages was investigated. For that, zebrafish embryo s/larvae were exposed to different 
concentrations of Direct Black 38, Reactive Blue 15 , Reactive Orange 16, and Vat 
Green 3 dye, to clarify any differences in sensitiv ity to the adverse effects of these 
classes of dye during development. Mortality, hatch ing rates, and malformations at 
different developmental stages attributed to the dy es exposure were observed and 
analyzed.

Indanthrene Olive Green B; CAS No.: 69500) was gent ly donated by Dystar (Brazil). 
The chemical structure of each dye is presented in Figure 1. In this study, dyes will be 
grouped according to their application class.  
2.2 Embryo-larval toxicity test  
2.2.1 Maintenance of zebrafish and acquisition of e ggs 
Adult male and female zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) were obtained from a commercial 
supplier (Pisciber, Barcelona) and kept separately in a closed flowzthrough system in 
reconstituted water in accordance with ISO standard  7346–1 [35] (2 mM CaCl 2.2H 2O; 
0.5 mM MgSO 4.7H 2O; 0.75 mM NaHCO 3; 0.07 mM KCl). The criterium for fish 
keeping was temperature of 26 ± 1°C at a 14/10 h li ght/dark photoperiod. Fish were fed 
with commercial dry flake food and live brine shrim p.  
For the acquisition of eggs, adult zebrafish male:f emale ratio of 2:1 was placed in 
breeding tanks (Aquaneering, San Diego, California)   the day before spawning. Plastic 
plants served as a spawning substrate and were fixe d to the bottom grid to prevent 
predation of eggs by adult zebrafish. About 30 minu tes after beginning of spawning 
(triggered by sudden illumination of the aquaria on  the next morning), the spawn traps 
were removed and the eggs were collected using plas tic disposable pipettes. Eggs were 
transferred immediately to Petri dishes and success ively cleaned with water dilution 
corresponding to the reconstituted water, according  to ISOzstandard [35], which was 
diluted 1:5 with deionized water. All eggs were exa mined under a dissecting 
microscope. Then, the unfertilized eggs were discar ded and those embryos exhibiting 
normal development that had reached the blastula st age were selected for subsequent 
experiments.  Page 9 of 31 Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry

 2.2.2 Embryo exposure 
Direct Black 38, Reactive Blue 15, and Reactive Ora nge 16 dyes were prepared 
with water dilution corresponding to the reconstitu ted water, according to ISOzstandard 
[35]. Vat Green 3 dye was dissolved in reconstitute d water ISOzstandard [35] 1:5 using 
deionized water. The tests were carried out using f ive different concentrations of each 
dye and positive or solvent controls. Doses were es tablished according to OECD draft 
guideline on Fish Embryo Toxicity (FET) Test [36], and determined in at least one 
previous rangezfinding assay or lethality test with  a limit concentration at 100 mg/L 
(data not shown).  
At 4 hours postzfertilization (hpf), 10 fertilized eggs per concentration were 
randomly selected and carefully distributed to a 24 zwell plate, filled with 2 mL of each 
dye solution as follows: Direct Black 38 (1.56, 3.1 2, 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/L), Reactive 
Blue 15, Reactive Orange 16 and Vat Green 3 at 6.25 , 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg/L. The 
tests were performed in triplicate in a climate cha mber at 27 ± 1°C on a 14zh light and 
10zh dark cycle. The exposure of embryos was static . Neither food nor aeration was 
provided during the bioassays. 
2.2.3 Selected endpoints 
Fish embryo test was carried out according to the p rotocols described by Nagel 
[37] and OECD Guideline TG 212 [38], with slight mo difications. The embryo test 
procedure was prolonged until 144 hpf to evaluate t he hatching rate, besides the 
evidence of delayed effects found in the initialzra nge finding experiments. Embryo 
development was assessed at 8, 24, 72, 96, 120, and  144 hpf, using a stereomicroscope 
(SMZz168, Motic). The evaluated endpoints in this s tudy are shown in Table 1.

 detachment of the tail, as well as lack of heartzbe at. Survival and malformation of larvae 
were observed and recorded every day after hatching . Sublethal endpoints used for 
assessing the developmental effects of dyes include d embryo malformations (yolk sac 
alterations, no rupture of the eggs membrane, defec ts in gas bladder inflation and 
skeletal deformities) and hatching success. Hatchin g was defined as the rupture of the 
egg membrane, and fully as well as partially hatche d larvae were counted as hatched 
embryos. The distinction between normal and abnorma l development of embryos was 
established according to the zebrafish development descriptions reported by Kimmel et 
al. [31]. Images of zebrafish at different postzfer tilization times were captured using a 
microscope with digital camera (Moticam 2000, Motic ).  
2.3 Criteria validity  
After egg collection, fertilization success was che cked and only batches of eggs 
with a minimum fertilization rate of 80% were used.  Control solutions were also made 
to confirm the accuracy of the test. 3,4 z Dichloro aniline (3.7 mg/L) was used as 
positive control, resulting in 100% mortality, whil e more than 90% survival was 
observed in the control group (data not shown). 
2.4  Statistical analysis  
Onezway ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple compar ison test was 
performed, using software package GraphPad Prism 5. 0 ® (version 5.0, GraphPad 
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Each experimental va lue was compared to its 
corresponding control. Statistical significance was  accepted when the probability of the 
result assuming the null hypothesis (p) was less th an 0.05.

 3. RESULTS 
 3.1 Effects on survival and hatching rate 
 No significant mortality of the fertilized zebrafi sh eggs exposed to DB38, RB15, 
RO16 and VG3 for 8 to 48 hpf was observed in the te sted conditions. 
No significant differences were observed between th e frequencies of hatching 
induced by the DB38, RB15, and VG3 dyes and the neg ative control. Only RO16 
caused delay or inhibition on the ability of zebraf ish embryos to hatch from the chorion, 
which was observed after 96 hpf at 100 mg/L, and re mained significant after 120 and 
144 hpf (Figure 2).   
3.2 Malformations 
 Embryo malformations such as defects in the gas bl adder inflation (Figure 3) 
have become apparent from the onset of hatching (96  hpf) in embryos exposed to DB38, 
RO16, and VG3 dyes. In contrast, for RB15 this deve lopmental effect occurred only 
after 120 hpf (Figure 4). 
 Larvae from the control groups presented no signif icant abnormality and had a 
oval shaped, transparent, and gaszfilled bladder, w hich was easily detected under the 
microscope (Figure 3A), while  embryos exposed to d yes DB38, RO16, RB15, and VG3 
presented nonzinflated swim bladder, as shown in Fi gure 3B, using a larvae exposed to 
DB38 as example.   
According to Figure 4, larvae exposed to the highes t doses of textile dyes 
showed defects in gas bladder inflation mainly afte r 120 hpf. However, larvae exposed 
to DB38 dye presented a failure in the gas bladder inflation from the concentration of Page 12 of 31 Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry

 6.25 mg/L at 96 hpf. More than 90% of larvae expose d to DB38 dye at 25 mg/L 
presented nonzinflated swim bladder. 
 In addition, other embryo malformations, such as y olk sac alteration and skeletal 
deformity were observed after exposure of embryos t o DB38 and VG3 dyes. DB38 
exposure induced curved tail on embryos from 120 hp f in a concentrationzdependent 
way (Figure 5A), whereas VG3 dye caused yolk sac ed ema (Figure 5B) in zebrafish 
larvae from 120 hpf. 
4. DISCUSSION 
Previous studies have mainly focused on the decolor ization of textile dye 
wastewater [26,39,40], evaluation of genotoxicity/m utagenicity of parent compound and 
byzproducts in vivo  [7] or in vitro  [12z14], as well as toxicity to aquatic organisms such 
as bioluminescent bacterium, algae, microcrustacean s and fish [4,14,20,23z30]. Once 
there is no information about the effects of dyes o n fish embryos, the toxicity of DB38, 
RB15, RO16, and VG3 dyes in zebrafish early life st ages was determined by the 
hatching rate, embryo malformations, including defe cts in the gas bladder inflation, 
yolk sac alteration and skeletal deformity. Table 1  shows these toxicological endpoints 
for the evaluation of lethal and sublethal effects of the dyes on zebrafish at 8, 24, 72, 96, 
120, and 144 hpf.  
Despite the great public demand for replacement of animal experiments for 
ethical reasons, industry has searched for alternat ive testing methods that are less costz 
intensive and less timez and spacezconsuming [32]. Zebrafish embryos represent an 
attractive model for studies of developmental toxic ity of chemicals both for human and 
environmental risk assessment, due to its rapid dev elopment, easy maintenance in the 
laboratory, large number of offspring, transparency  of embryos and access to Page 13 of 31 Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry

 experimental manipulation [32,41]. Additionally, ac cording to current European Union 
legislation [42] for the protection of animals used  for experimental and other scientific 
purposes, the use of vertebrate embryo is not regul ated, and fish embryos are considered 
as nonzprotected life stages and similar to in vitro  assays z an alternative to animal 
testing, despite using whole organisms [43,44]. Zeb rafish embryos are also well suited 
for studies of sublethal effects and toxicity mecha nisms. Inclusion of sublethal 
endpoints in ecotoxicity testing, in addition to le thality, is of great importance since 
such effects may occur in nonztarget organisms, wit h significant impacts on populations 
or ecosystems [41]. 
According to the literature, LC 50  values of many commercial dyes have been 
estimated in adult fish at different time intervals . Hormazabal et al. [45] showed that 
malachite green (MG), a triarylmethane dye, is high ly toxic to freshwater fish, in both 
acute and chronic exposures. Others authors also ob served changes in LC 50  values of 
MG in the freshwater catfish Heteropneustes fossilis,  at different exposure times, and 
stated that toxicity increased with exposure time [ 46]. The results of the present study 
demonstrated no significant mortality or lethal eff ect of DB38, RB15, RO16, and VG3 
dyes on zebrafish embryos at 8 to 48 hpf in the tes ted conditions. 
Figure 2 shows the effects of RO16 on hatching succ ess of zebrafish embryo. 
Delayed hatching may be due to an inability of embr yos to break the chorion. This 
result indicates that the RO16 dye significantly re duced the hatching rate at 100 mg/L at 
96, 120, and 144 hpf (p<0.05). Recent studies have shown that other environmental 
contaminants including hexabromocyclododecanes dias tereoisomers (αzHBCD and βz
HBCD) also caused hatching delay in zebrafish embry os [47]. Page 14 of 31 Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry

 Fish are exposed to aquatic toxicants via the delic ate respiratory surface of the 
gills, which comprise over half of the body surface  area, and make intimate contact with 
the surrounding water. Usually, low pollutant conce ntrations may not result in fish 
mortality, but may still be toxic to this species [ 30]. In this study, the most considerable 
developmental defect caused by textile dyes was the  failure of the gas bladder to inflate. 
The gas bladder, commonly referred as the swim blad der, is a vascularized internal 
organ found in almost all teleosts. It controls the  buoyancy and locomotory movements 
of fish [48].  The failure in the gas bladder infla tion of zebrafish larvae can cause 
impaired motility, which can ultimately lead to dea th. 
As can be seen in Figure 3, all dyes have induced d efects in the swim bladder 
inflation of zebrafish larvae at 120 and 144 hpf (p <0.05). Larvae exposed to DB38 dye 
exhibited a morphological abnormality, which includ ed the development of an abnormal 
dorsally curved tail. This tail curvature was first  observed at 120 hpf in fish exposed to 
the highest dose of DB38 (25.0 mg/L), and remained significant at 144 hpf (Figure 5A).  
Direct Black 38 is a triazo dye based on benzidine,  an aromatic amine, classified 
as a human carcinogen by the IARC [17]. Although th e European Community has 
banned the use of benzidinezbased dyes since 2003 [ 49], these compounds have been 
detected in several countries, including Mexico [50 ], India [17], and Brazil [51]. 
According to Dapson [52], the use of benzidinezbase d dyes is very common in 
underdeveloped countries, where ambitions in relati on to international trade outweigh 
concerns about the risks to health and environment.  Similar fact was observed with the 
MG, which has been banned in several countries and was not approved by US Food and 
Drug Administration, but it is still used in many p arts of the world due to its low cost, 
ready availability and efficacy [29].  Page 15 of 31 Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry

  Yolk sac was another toxicological endpoint analyz ed in this study, once it 
provides nutritive material vital for the movement of larvae, and plays an important role 
in the early development of zebrafish [48].  Figure  5B shows that the VG3 dye at 100 
mg/L also induced yolk sac edema in larvae at 120 a nd 144 hpf (p<0.05).  These results 
are similar to the findings of Du et al. [47], who found that HBCD diastereoisomers, 
substances detected in practically all environmenta l media, caused malformation in 
zebrafish embryos including yolk sac edema.  
 
5. CONCLUSION 
 In summary, the present results clearly show that the textile dyes DB38, RB15, 
RO16, and VG3 can affect the embryonic and larval d evelopment of zebrafish ( Danio 
rerio ) in a dosezdependent manner, based on the delayed hatching of eggs, presence of 
malformation including defects in gas bladder infla tion, yolk sac alteration and skeletal 
deformity, and thus decreased survivorship. The fou r textile dyes exhibited different 
developmental toxicity to zebrafish embryos, and th e order of the toxicity was DB38 > 
VG3 > RO16 > RB15. 
 It is important to evaluate the toxicity at variou s trophic levels, in particular with 
fish. Due to its similarities of vertebrate embryos , zebrafish is used as a model for 
human and environmental sciences. Therefore, the bi oassay with zebrafish embryos can 
be used as an initial screening test to analyze the  toxicity of dyes and to manage dyez
containing effluents, in order to prevent human hea lth risks and minimize impacts on 
aquatic environments.
