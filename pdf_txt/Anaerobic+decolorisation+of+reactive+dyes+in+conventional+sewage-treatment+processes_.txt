ABSTRACT Several studies have reported that the color in dye wastewaters could be removed effectively
by a combined biological treatment, ie, anaerobic digestion followed by aerobic degradation. Therefore,
the Phoredox or anaerobic/aerobic process, which is a biological phosphorus (BPR) system, seems to be
a very good combination for the decolorization of dye wastewater from the textile industry. This studycompared the performance of conventional and anoxic+anaerobic/aerobic (A+A/A) sequencing batch
reactors (SBRs) in removing organic matter, total kjeldahl nitrogen and color. The two SBR systems with
8 days of sludge age were operated under the same feeding, reacting, settling and withdrawal periods.
However, the 10-hour reaction period of the conventional SBR was totally aerobic whereas that of the
A+A/A system was separated into 2 hours of anoxic+anaerobic followed by 8 hours of aerobic conditions.The feed wastewaters contained specific target dyes, ie, disperse, sulfur and reactive dyes, which were
collected directly from the treatment plants of local textile factories. At the steady state, it was found, as
expected, that both systems were able to reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total Kjeldahl
nitrogen (TKN) of the wastewaters to the same extent. The phosphorus removal efficiency of the A+A/
A system was not so good, approximately only twice as high as that of the conventional system due tolimited volatile fatty acids and anaerobic contact time. The visual color removal of the A+A/A system
was impressive and seemed to be a step ahead of the conventional system. The anaerobic digestion is
considerably a necessary step for decolorization of dye wastewaters. Disperse dye was degraded to formnon-color by-products whilst the sulfur and reactive dyes were degraded to yield colored by-products
which were readily degraded under aerobic environment. The apparent color removal efficiencies of both
models measured in terms of color intensity as space unit (SU) and ADMI were, however, not convincing.
This is probably due to turbidity and/or solute interference during the color measuring process.

INTRODUCTION
The textile industry is one of the largest water users
and polluters that still threaten the environment withits highly colored discharge. This colored wastewateris perceived by public as highly toxic. As a result, it isan urgent task to lessen the obnoxious appearance inthe receiving water. In general, activated sludgesystems and other traditional aerobic biologicalprocesses used in most textile factories, though ableto remove organic carbon effectively , cannot reducecolor satisfactorily . This is because the dyes ordinarilyused in the coloring process are rarely biodegradableor are even non-biodegradable under an aerobicenvironment
1. However, Porter and Snider (1976)2
and Dohanyos et al. (1978)3 reported that certain dyes
could be removed by adsorption onto microbial cellsor flocs under a high mixed liquor suspended solids(MLSS) concentration and long contact time. Inaddition, it was later discovered that some particulardyes especially those with an azo group were
anaerobically biodegradable. The color removal isbelieved to be due to the chemical reductive cleavageof azo bonds within the dye molecules under theanaerobic conditions.
4,5 Nonetheless, the inter mediate
products of these sequent reactions are carcinogenicaromatic amines which need to be further degradedto more stable and inert substances.
6,7 Under the
aerobic conditions, certain dyes and by-products fromthe anaerobic degradation including carcinogenicaromatic amines can be hydroxylated by breakingdown the aromatic ring, which results in the formationof several stable end products such as CO
2 and H2O.
Aerobic color removal, however, was found to be lesseffective than anaerobic means. In general, themodification of any existing conventional system toan anoxic+anaerobic/aerobic (A+A/A) process is quitesimple and inexpensive; hence, it is of interest toevaluate and compare the performance between theconventional and A+A/A systems.ESEARCH ARTICLER122 ScienceAsia  25 (1999)
It was the aim of this study to investigate the color
as well as organic carbon measured in terms ofchemical oxygen demand (COD) and total Kjeldahlnitrogen (TKN) removal efficiencies of disperse,sulfur, and reactive dye wastewaters by the facultativemicroorganisms existing in the A+A/A system andcompare them with those of aerobic microbes in aconventional process both of which were operated inthe sequencing batch reactor (SBR) mode.

MATERIALS  AND METHODS
T wo identical bench-scale systems of conventional
and A+A/A SBRs were set up as shown in Fig 1. Eachsystem consisted of a 14 litre acrylic tank (20x20x35cm
3) and was automatically controlled by a
microprocessor at the sludge age of 8 days with anoperating cycle as indicated in Table 1. Thewastewaters from three sources which containdifferent types of dyes, namely disperse, sulfur, andreactive dyes, were used to feed the experimentalsystems. The wastewaters were collected from theequalizing tanks of two treatment plants locatedapproximately 50 and 60 km east of Bangkok once aweek and stored at 4°C in the dark until used. Thepreserved wastewaters were allowed to reach roomtemperature of 24 to 27°C before being fed into the
test units. T ypical characteristics of all three dye-wastewaters are illustrated in Table 2. If necessary ,the appropriate amounts of nitrogen (urea,(NH
4)2CO), phosphorus (KH2PO4), and sulfuric acid
were added to the wastewaters to maintain theCOD:N:P (chemical oxygen demand:nitrogen:phosphorus) ratio of 150:5:1 and to adjust the pHto be within 6.5-7.5. All experimental systems wereinoculated to achieve the initial MLSS of 1,500 mg l
-1
with the sludge from the treatment plants of the samedye houses where the wastewaters were collected toensure the acclimation of the microbes. Anappropriate portion from the 10-litre mixed liquorin the reactor vessels was collected at the end of eachstage and analyzed for concerned parametersfollowing the procedures described in StandardMethods.
10 The measurement of color in space units
(SU) and ADMI was performed according to themethods specified by Eckenfelder et al. (1992)
11 and
Allen et al. (1973),12  respectively . The samples were,
however, not filtered so that the ‘apparent’ colorunder actual conditions was determined. Theexperimental systems took 20 cycles or more to reachthe steady state and the samples were collected andanalyzed after another 12 cycles at the steady state.

RESULTS  AND DISCUSSION
The removal efficiencies and operational parameters
at the steady state are summarized in Table 3. Thesteady-state MLSS values of the systems fed with thedisperse, sulfur, and reactive dye wastewaters were1070, 439, and 597 mg l
-1, respectively , for Model A,
and were 1119, 377, and 657 mg l-1, respectively , for
Model B. The high MLSS in the systems fed withdisperse dye wastewater is reasonable since the BOD
5
(5-day biochemical oxygen demand) of thisparticular wastewater is approximately two-foldgreater than for the others. Relatively low MLSSconcentrations similar to those found in this studyhave been commonly experienced and reported inmany textile treatment plants.

The removal efficiencies in terms of COD and
TKN of the two models were comparable as shownin Table 3. Fig 2 represents a typical profile of theremaining COD in each cycle for both models. Twosteps COD removal occurred in A+A/A system whichsuggests certain non-anaerobic-degradable by-products were formed which were degraded later inthe aerobic environment. A low degree of phosphorusremoval has been observed; however, Model B, whichis the BPR configuration, obviously exhibited a betterperformance than Model A. The low phosphorusremoval of the A+A/A process in this study was
expected since the majority of organic substancescontained in the wastewater are not short-chainvolatile fatty acids (SCVFAs) which are essential forthe BPR process but are rather starch which is slowlybiodegraded to SCVFAs; thus not enough VFAs werereadily available for phosphate accumulatingorganisms (PAOs). In addition, the short retentiontime under the anaerobic environment might alsohinder the phosphorus release activity of the PAOs.The small amount of phosphorus reduction observedin Model A was on the other hand mainly due to thecell synthesis. A slight drop in pH values wasobserved, which may be due to the degradation ofthe VFA portion in the wastewaters. The dissolvedoxygen (DO) and oxidation-reduction potential(ORP) correlated with each other very well whichassured the required conditions for anoxic,anaerobic, and aerobic stages. As anticipated, ModelB with an anoxic stage was able to reduce nitrogento a greater extent than Model A as illustrated bythe nitrate concentrations in the effluents. Smallvariations in mixed liquor temperature resulted fromthe seasonal changes in ambient temperature.
Of greater concern is the finding that both Models
A and B were able to remove color in the wastewaterbetter than a more expensive chemical treatment by124 ScienceAsia  25 (1999)
alum or lime. However, the A+A/A Model B showed
significantly greater color reduction as shown in Fig3, 4, and 5 for disperse, sulfur, and reactive dyewastewaters, respectively.  Shaul et al.  (1985)

noticed that the color in wastewater containing
insoluble dyes such as disperse and sulfur dyes wasable to be removed effectively by a biosorptionprocess. Nonetheless, that is not the case for thisstudy since the differences in the efficiency basedon visual justification of both models were obviouswhereas the steady-state concentrations of the mixedliquor suspended solids in both systems werecomparable. Hence, this implies that thebiodegradation process, which occurred afterbiosorption, should be an important step thatenhanced the degradation of the dyes and controlled
the decolorization effectiveness. Furthermore, it wasfound that anaerobic digestion is the important stagefor biological decolorazation. The A+A/A system fedwith disperse-dye wastewater indicated an intensivecolor removal during anaerobic period of less thantwo hours rather than 8-hour aerobic contact time.Although the anaerobic decolorization of sulfur- andreactive-dye wastewaters was not as appearent asthat of disperse-dye wastewater, certain dye cleavagesoccurred during anaerobic environment. The by-products were later degraded readily under thefollowing aerobic stage. As a result, betterdecolorization was achieved in the A+A/Aconfiguration than in solely aerobic system. ThisTable 3.

observation was in agreement with the COD
reduction mentioned previously as well as confirmsthe results from the studies of Meyer (1981)
4 and
Carliell et al.  (1994).5
The removal efficiencies in terms of color
intensity , expressed in SU and ADMI as shown inTable 4, were, however, contrary to the convincingvisual observations; in other word, the scientific dataindicated a worse process performance than in reality.This discrepancy may be due to certain sources ofinterference such as turbidity , as mentioned in thestudy of Carliell et al. (1994).
5 Hence, this suggests
that one should be cautious when using colorintensity in terms of SU and ADMI to determine thedecolorization efficiency and only “true” color (afterfiltration) should be used as the basis for comparison.
CONCLUSION
In terms of COD and TKN reduction, both
conventional and A+A/A SBR systems showedcomparable efficiencies. Even though thephosphorus removal efficiencies of the A+A/A unitsin this study were lower than those of other BPRsystems reported in the literature due to the lack ofvolatile fatty acids in the feed wastewater and thelimited anaerobic detention time, they were stillapproximately twice as efficient as those ofconventional systems. The color removal efficiencymeasured scientifically in terms of SU and ADMIfor both models was found to be unsatisfactory andcontrary to the impressive visual observations assummarized in Table 4, perhaps due to turbidityinterference in the color measurement.
A modification of an existing aerobic system to
an A+A/A system is practical and economical sincethe initial investment cost for system alteration willbe finally offset by the reduction in the aeration cost.Additionally , it was found that A+A/A operationcould reduce the sludge-bulking problem as well asprovide an anoxic environment for the denitrificationprocess. In summary , the A+A/A process proved tobe a better alternative for decolorization of dyewastewaters as compared to the ordinary aerobicprocess and chemical precipitation. As a result, anyexisting textile factories that currently useconventional processes should consider investingand modifying their systems to the A+A/A path. The
improvement in color and nitrogen removal as wellas the reduction in power consumption for aerationis believed to be a worthwhile investment.\
