Abstract Use of nitrogen- and phosphorus-based synthetic
fertilizers shows an increasing trend, but this has led to large-
scale influx of reactive nitrogen in the environment, with
serious implications on human health and the environment.
On the other hand, phosphorus, a non-renewable resource,
faces a serious risk of depletion. Therefore, recovery and
reuse of nitrogen and phosphorus is highly desirable. Fornitrogen recovery, an ion exchange/adsorption-based process
provides concentrated streams of reactive nitrogen.
Bioelectrochemical systems efficiently and effectively recov-er nitrogen as NH
3(g) or (NH 4)2SO4. Air stripping of ammo-
nia from anaerobic digestate has been reported to recover 70 –
92 % of nitrogen. Membrane separation provides recovery inthe order of 99 –100 % with no secondary pollutant in the
permeate.With regard to phosphorus (P) removal, physicalfiltration and membrane processes have the potential to re-duce suspended P to trace amounts but provide minimal dis-
solved P removal. Chemical precipitation can remove 80 –
99 % P in wastewater streams and recover it in the form of
fertilizer (struvite). Acid hydrolysis can convert recovered P
into usable phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizers.
Physical-chemical adsorption and ion exchange media canreduce P to trace or non-detect concentrations, with minimal
waste production and high reusability. Biological assimilation
through constructed wetlands removes both N (83 –87 %) and
P( 7 0 –85 %) from wastewaters, with recovery in the form offish/animal feeds and biofuel. The paper discusses methodsand important results on recovery of nitrogen and phosphorusfrom wastewater.

Introduction
Nutrients found in waste streams are mostly compounds of
carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (CNP). All of them are im-portant for sustenance of various life forms. Nitrogen and
phosphorus are essential components of cell ’sD N A ,a m i n o -
acids, and chlorophyll. In eukaryotic cells, phosphorus is the
Benergy currency ^of the cells in the form of adenosine tri-
phosphate, or ATP [ 1]. Nitrogen and phosphorus play critical
roles in plant growth and food supply. While nitrogen abun-dantly exists in atmosphere (78 %) in a highly stable and non-
reactive form N
2gas, its content is limited in soils. Therefore,
in order to make it usable and increase its availability in soils,
nitrogen is fixed in reactive forms such as amino-acids, nitrate,
and ammonia.
Most naturally occurring reactive nitrogen (6.5 Tg
(teragram) N/year in US [ 2] and 100 –300 Tg N/year globally
[3]) comes from lightning (2 %) and biological fixation
(98 %). However, natural fixing of nitrogen is insufficient tomeet the food and energy demand of the rising world popula-
tion [ 4]. Therefore, anthropogenic production of reactive ni-
trogen shows an increasing trend [ 5].
On the other hand, the problem with phosphorus in the
environment is of exhaustion, since it is a non-renewable re-source. The most common form of phosphorus on earth is
locked in igneous and sedimentary deposits, with mining of
these rocks being the most viable method of extraction. UsingThis article is part of the Topical Collection on Water Pollution

the current rates of extraction and consumption, these Breadily
exploitable ^sources of phosphorus will be depleted within
next 45 –100 years, as shown in Fig. 1[6]. Moreover, as these
reserves become exhausted the quality will inevitably become
more variable, leading to lower phosphorus concentrations
and higher impurities [ 7].
The use of synthetic fertilizer shows an increasing trend of
15 Tg/year, with developing countries contributing more tothe increase [ 3]. Smil et al. [ 8] estimate that the use of nitrog-
enous and phosphorus fertilizers has made a difference be-
tween malnutrition and adequate diet for nearly one-third of
humanity. Evidently, use of nitrogenous and phosphorus-based fertilizers is critical to fight world hunger. However,
only 4 Tg of reactive nitrogen (out of 170 Tg applied annual-
ly) actually accumulates in crop and the rest is lost through airand water pathways [ 8], impacting human health, bio-diversi-
ty, and air and water quality [ 3,9]. Two percent of global
reactive nitrogen introduced annually escapes as N
2O and
contributes to global warming and affects the ozone layer [ 9]
and 12 % escapes as NO xand NH 3, affecting the atmosphere
in numerous ways [ 10]. Additionally, resulting climate change
and nitrogen interactions may also affect agricultural produc-
tivity by exposing crops to elevated O 3levels [ 11], flooding
and extreme precipitation, drought, and heat. Moreover, phos-phorus discharge, even in concentrations, as low as 0.02 mg/l
can induce eutrophication of rivers and lakes, making thembogs that are unfit for navigation, fresh water supply, recrea-
tion, or agriculture [ 12,13]. Ever increasing large fertilizer
production may not be able to fully meet the food demand
unless nitrogen and phosphorus are managed judiciously.
Since a large fraction of the synthetic fertilizer production
escapes into the atmosphere [ 8], recovery of lost nutrient holds
promise in mitigating this problem. It works on the principle
of 3R ’s: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Nutrient recovery, there-
fore, reduces the burden on reactive nitrogen and phosphorus
production, which in turn would ensure less reactive nitrogen
and phosphorus entry into the environment. This would lead
to efficient use of nutrient and cause less adverse effect on theenvironment. Nutrient recovery would re-introduce recovered
nitrogen and phosphorus as fertilizer and drop its price andthus the overall food cost. Apart from tangible economic ben-efits, it would also reduce the nitrogen and phosphorus load-
ing in the atmosphere, leading to a cleaner and greener envi-ronment [ 14].
The objective of this review is to study and compile the
methods used for nitrogen and phosphorus recovery fromwastewater. The work outlines the theoretical mechanism
and concepts and recent innovations and results of each meth-
od. The review covers methods based on physical, chemical,and biological principles.
Methods of Nitrogen Recovery
Ion Exchange and Adsorption-Based Methods
Reactive nitrogen exists as NH 4+at typical wastewater pH
values [ 15]. It is also a significant contaminant in domestic
grey water and urine [ 16]. Because it is a cation, ion exchange
and adsorption-based processes are highly relevant because of
their unique properties such as high selectivity for NH 4+,h i g h
removal, fast uptake kinetics and regeneration [ 17–20], less
space requirements and simplicity of application and opera-tion [ 21], being environmental friendly [ 22]a si tu s e sn a t u r a l -
ly occurring and easy-to-modify ion-exchanger/adsorbent
such as zeolite [ 23], and releases non-toxic exchangeable
cations (Na
+,K+,C a2+, and Mg2+). The most popular ion
exchanger/adsorbent for nitrogen recovery is zeolite. Naturalzeolites have a tetrahedral framework where aluminum and
silicon atoms are covalently bonded to common oxygen atoms
forming interconnected cages and channels [ 22]. Substitution
of each Si
4+with Al3+causes a net negative charge on the
framework. These substitutions are termed isomorphous assmall sized atoms occupy sites previously occupied by largeratoms. The greater the substitution, the higher the negative
charge on the zeolite. These negative charges within the pores
are balanced by charged cations such as Na
+,K+,C a2+,a n d
Mg2+on the zeolite surface. These cations are held by weaker
electrostatic forces and are exchanged with NH 4+in the solu-
tion. There are more than 50 kinds of naturally occurring
Fig. 1 Estimated global
phosphorus reserves (Source:
Duley, 1998 [ 6])156 Curr Pollution Rep (2015) 1:155 –166zeolites [ 24] which occur at different places and have different
characteristics [ 25,26]. These differences in characteristics are
attributed to variations in the regional geological formation
[18]. Therefore, each zeolite has to be studied and modified
individually to determine its optimum performance [ 26].
Performance of zeolites has been studied from the perspectiveof their homoionic forms, grain size, pH, influent NH
4+con-
centration, hydraulic retention time, ionic strength- competi-tion with respect to other cations, and temperature [ 18,19,26].
Modification improves adsorption capacity and purity of zeo-
lites. Treatment with acids, alkali and salts of alkaline metals,
integrated calcinations, and microwave treatment are some ofthe popular modification techniques [ 23,26,34].
Once adsorbents/ion-exchangers are exhausted, nitrogen
recovery and reuse opportunities are exploited. The loadedzeolites can be applied directly onto agricultural fields as
slow-release fertilizers [ 26]. Most popular is the regeneration
technique using NaCl solution [ 23,26]w h e r eN H
4+is
desorbed and exchanged with Na+in solution. This provides
a concentrated stream of NH 4+[18,20]. Other regeneration
techniques such as acid regeneration [ 20], heating regenera-
tion (particularly useful for exothermic adsorption process)[23], and biological regeneration [ 27] can also be used, de-
pending on the recovery process employed subsequently [ 20].
The regeneration step results in concentrated stream of NH
4Cl
in chemical regeneration [ 19,25]o rN a N O 3in biological re-
generation [ 27,28]. The concentrated regenerant solution, af-
ter raising its pH above 9.3 (pKa of NH 4+-NH 3system), can
be air stripped of its ammonia content, and the brine solution
can be recovered. The NH 3gas can be further sorbed into
H2SO4solution [ 29] or HNO 3solution [ 30]. Liberti et al.
[29] reported that the NH 3-sorbed H 2SO4solution could be
used as a fertilizer. The nitrate-rich solution obtained after
biological regeneration can also be used as a fertilizer [ 28].
Liberti et al. [ 31] proposed a combined anion and cation ex-
change scheme where both ammonium and phosphate ionswere concentrated and then precipitated as magnesium ammo-
nium phosphate also known as struvite, a known slow-releasefertilizer. Karapinar [ 17] utilized ammonium-loaded zeolite as
a seeding material for precipitating calcium phosphate andsuggested the possibility of using the precipitate-ammonium-loaded zeolites as fertilizer. Lind et al. [ 32] used saturated
clinoptililolite, wollastonite, and a natural zeolite and a smallamount of MgO to recover nitrogen (65 –80 % recovery) as
struvite and as adsorbed crystalline NH
4+on the zeolites. Lin
et al. [ 33] proposed a two-step scheme where NH 4+adsorption
to a zeolite released Ca2+ions to solution which formed the
precipitate of calcium phosphate. Additionally, the used zeo-
lite can be used as green fertilizer. Huang et al. [ 34]u s e d
MgCl 2-modified zeolite to simultaneously precipitate ammo-
nium and phosphate ions as struvite utilizing the Mg2+-loaded
zeolite as the magnesium source. Recently, some novel adsor-
bents, such as carbon nanotubes [ 35], hydrogels [ 36], andnatural substances such as wheat straw and volcanic tuff,
[37] have been reported for ammonium removal. Wang et al.
[38] synthesized palygorskite nanocomposite which exhibited
excellent adsorption capacity of 237.7 mg/g and was reused asa slow-release fertilizer. Zheng et al. [ 39] reported the use of
chitosan-g-poly(acrylic acid)/attapulgite (CTS-g-PAA/APT)
hydrogels prepared by in situ co-polymerization in aqueous
solution. It showed an adsorption capacity of 21 mg/g. The
NH
4+-loaded hydrogel, with its unique water retention char-
acteristics and multi-functionality, can be used as a fertilizer in
agriculture. Wheat straw as adsorbents have received much
focus recently [ 40,41]. Wheat straw has a high ammonium
uptake capacity of 148.7 mg/g [ 40]. Liu et al. [ 41]p r e p a r e d
super adsorbent resin (SAR) from wheat straw, optimized itsperformance, and suggested its use as a slow-release fertilizer.Jellali et al. [ 42] reported the use of another natural biodegrad-
able waste Posidonia oceanica (P . oceanica )f o ra m m o n i u m
recovery and suggested its possible use as bio-compost inagriculture. Wahab et al. [ 43] used sawdust to recover ammo-
nium ions from the wastewater and suggested the use ofammonium-loaded sawdust as bio-compost and fertilizers.
Bioelectrochemical Systems (BES)
In BES, chemical energy contained in the organic matter is
directly converted to electrical energy by certain microorgan-isms. Bio-oxidation of organic matter generates electrons and
simultaneously produces other valuable compounds. At the
anode, anaerobic bacteria oxidize the organic matter, often
represented by the oxidation of acetate [ 44]:
CH
3COO−þ4H2O→2HCO 3−þ9Hþþ8e−
Microorganisms transfer these generated electrons to an-
ode, which is connected over an external circuit to cath-
ode—the site of reduction reaction. Based on the cathodic
reaction, BESs can be classified into two types: galvanic and
electrolytic cells. Galvanic cells are microbial fuel cells
(MFCs) which produce electricity by coupling the anodic ox-idation to the reduction of an electron acceptor [ 45]. In elec-
trolytic cells, typically called microbial electrolysis cell(MES), electricity is needed to carry out the reduction reactionat the cathode and anodic oxidation is coupled to reduction of
protons to hydrogen gas [ 46,47]. The cathodic reaction of an
MFC is oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and for MEC is
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At near neutral or alka-
line pH, the reaction can be written respectively as:
2H
2OþO2þ4e−→4OH−
2H2Oþ2e−→H2þ2OH−
Anode and cathode chambers are separated by an ion ex-
change membrane to prevent mixing of the oxidation and
reduction products [ 46,48]. The ion exchange membraneCurr Pollution Rep (2015) 1:155 –166 157maintains electro-neutrality by allowing anions and/or cations
to pass through.
BES scheme is potentially a sustainable way of treating
wastewater as it produces electricity and recovers ammoniaand utilizes low-grade substrates such as wastewater itself as
an electron source, thus reducing the use of carbon source.However, present energy recovery is too low [ 49].
Therefore, low energy recovery and requirements (due to re-duced aeration) make it more suitable for contaminant remov-al and resource recovery.
In the case of ammonium recovery, the organic matter in
wastewater is oxidized at the anode by bacteria, while ammo-nium ions are transported over a cation exchange membrane
to the cathode chamber [ 50], where the high pH allows for
recovery as ammonia. BES systems do not need addition of a
strong base as compared to other ammonia recovery technol-
ogies. Kuntke et al. [ 51] successfully recovered ammonia
from urine through volatilization due to high pH of the cath-
ode chamber and aeration and subsequent absorption in an
acid solution in an MFC. Desloover et al. [ 52] recovered am-
monia from anaerobic digestate using an MEC, where ammo-
nia transported across a membrane in the cathode was stripped
by the produced hydrogen gas with much lower energy de-
mand than the conventional stripping. Haddadi et al. [ 53]
established that higher current density would greatly enhancethe ammonia recovery in an MFC as 61 % of ammonia trans-port is electricity driven. Wu and Modin [ 54] using an MEC
achieved simultaneous hydrogen production and ammonia re-covery (96 % from synthetic wastewater and 79 % from realwastewater) by manipulating the catholyte pH to 12 obtained
due to current generation.
BES schemes are new and need optimization of various
parameters. Ammonia recovery greatly depends upon currentdensity, catholyte pH, concentration of ammonium ions in the
waste stream, type of membrane, and equilibrium among ions.These parameters are inter-related, e.g., current density deter-
mines catholyte pH which in turn is affected by type of mem-
brane and ions in the solution [ 55]. Janicek et al. [ 56] conclude
that pilot studies are essential to show the practical feasibility
of BES. No full-scale applications of BES technologies have
been reported so far. In 2013, Wetsus has set up a pilot plant atthe water board of Fryslân, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.
Air Stripping of AmmoniaAir stripping of ammonia has been in use for nitrogen removal
[57]. It is a pH-dependent scheme where at pH around 9.3,
ammonium nitrogen from solution converts to ammonia gas.
Therefore, in the process, lime or caustic soda is usually ap-
plied to keep the pH around 10.8 –1 1 . 5 .T h i sc o n v e r t sa m m o -
nium ions to ammonia in solution, and simultaneous air sup-
ply converts it to ammonia gas and strips ammonia according
to the following reaction [ 58]:NH
4þþOH−air
⇒H2OþNH 3gðÞ
For high stripping efficiency, the process is carried out in a
packed tower, as it provides large mass transfer area. The
process is affected by various factors such as ammonium con-centration of feed, hydraulic loading, air flow rate, packing,
etc., but most important are pH and temperature [ 59–61]. Guo
et al. [ 59] reported increased ammonia recovery efficiency
from 80 to 92 % on pH increase of 8 –11. Gustin and
Marinsck-Lograb [ 58] noted 27 % recovery efficiency at
pH 8.5 but it rapidly rose to 92 % as the pH changed to 11.
Several studies established a pH value of 11 –12 for econom-
ically optimum recovery [ 60,61]. Gustin and Marinsck-
Lograb [ 58] reported a pH of 10.5 at temperature of 50 °C.
Bonmati and Flotats [ 62] obtained 87 % recovery at a pH of
9.5 and a temperature of 80 °C; they also concluded that theair stripping is independent of pH at temperature greater than
80 °C. Katehis et al. [ 63] obtained a temperature value of
75 °C at which the process becomes pH insensitive.
Ammonia stripping has been successfully used for large-
scale treatment of municipal wastewater treatment plants
[64]. However, in practice, packed towers are easily fouled
[61]. Therefore, Quan et al. [ 60] came up with a newly de-
signed gas liquid contactor, a water-sparged aerocyclone(WSA). The contactor displayed higher stripping efficiencyand excellent mass transfer efficiency and consumed less air
compared to stripping tanks and packed towers. Another con-
cern in ammonia stripping is the chemical demand, whichconsists of (i) alkali for raising the pH and then (ii) acid for
lowering the pH post stripping. CO
2absorption using stripped
ammonia can be used to adjust the pH. McLeod et al. [ 65]
came up with a novel scheme where ammonia-rich wastewa-ter was used as an absorbent to selectively extract CO
2from
biogas, during its upgrading to biomethane in a packed bed
mode. The study claimed recovery of ammonia as NH 4HCO 3,
which is a commercially profitable fertilizer. Jiang et al. [ 66]
recovered 90 % ammonia from anaerobically digested dairymanure as (NH
4)2SO4. The study suggested its use as concen-
trated nitrogen fertilizer. The scheme also produced electricityand biogas. Ledda et al. [ 67] used animal slurries to recover
nitrogen as (NH
4)2SO4from an integrated process scheme
utilizing ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and cold ammoniastripping. The scheme recovered 71 % nitrogen with 1.8 m
3
concentrated (NH 4)2SO4obtained for every 100 m3of treated
digestate.
Membrane-Based Recovery Schemes
Membrane-based separation processes have been utilized in
many wastewater operations [ 61,68–70] with microfiltration
(MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse os-mosis (RO) being the predominant technologies. Nunes and158 Curr Pollution Rep (2015) 1:155 –166Peimmann [ 69] recovered ammonia gas in an acid solution
using a gas-permeable membrane operated by vacuum pres-
sure. Hasanoglu et al. [ 70] recovered ammonia as (NH 4)2SO4
on the permeate side of a macroporous hydrophobic mem-
brane. Kurama et al. [ 71] recovered 96.9 % of ammonium
ions from using RO. Gerardo et al. [ 72] using cross-flow
MF recovered nitrogen and p hosphorus from dairy farm
sludge. Mondor et al. [ 73] produced a concentrated nitrogen
fertilizer (containing 13 g/l of NH 3-N) from liquid swine ma-
nure using electro-dialysis and reverse osmosis; however, theynoticed significant (21.2 %) ammonia volatilization in the
process. Membrane-based processes offer distinct advantagesas ammonia recovery is independent of gas or liquid flow
rates, absence of secondary pollutants in ammonia permeate,
and concentration of ammonia does not affect ammonia re-moval efficiency.
A summation of all nitrogen removal and recovery
methods, as discussed above, is provided in Table 1:

Physical Filtration and Membrane Processes
In areas where phosphorus concentrations are close to the
regulated effluent levels, rapid sand filtration can offer a
simple and practical solution for tertiary phosphorus reduc-
tion. Phosphorus in wastewater can exist as both solidorganics and as dissolved phosphates. Solid organic phos-
phates are directly related to the concentration of 5-day
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), total suspended
solids (TSS), and volatile suspended solids (VSS) of the
wastewater [ 74].
Performance evaluations performed by Barrett have shown
that rapid sand filtration can remove, on average, 90 % of TSSin wastewater, leading to an effluent concentration of
∼0.05 mg P/L in the form of organic phosphates [ 75]. While
rapid sand filtration could provide a viable option for solid
organic phosphate removal in wastewater, it will not help in
the reduction of dissolved phosphorus, nor will it provide aneasy source of recoverable phosphorus.
An alternative to rapid sand filtration is membrane filtra-
tion, which has been gaining ground in recent years due toimprovements in performance and cost. Unlike rapid sand
filtration, membrane filtrat ion has the added benefit of
collecting dissolved as well as solid phosphorus, drastically
improving phosphorus removal. Some of the more common
membrane filters currently in use are tertiary membrane filters,
reverse osmosis (RO) systems, and membrane bioreactors(MBRs), which use a suspended growth medium to aid in
removal. Facilities using these systems have seen effluent
concentrations of ∼0.04 mg P/L for tertiary membranes and
MBRs, and as low as 0.008 mg P/L for RO systems [ 76].
Although these processes produce excellent results, they areoften expensive and, like rapid sand filtration, do not provide
an easily recoverable source of phosphorus.

In some cases, the easiest and cheapest way to remove excess
dissolved phosphorus from wastewater effluent is through
chemical precipitation, often through the use of calcium, alu-
minum, or iron. The most common precipitates used by waste-water treatment facilities are lime (Ca(OH)
2), alum
(Al2(SO 4)3·18H 2O), and ferric chloride (FeCl 3)[77]. The
use of these chemicals can also form trace amounts of solublehydroxide and phosphate complexes, though the concentra-
tions of these complexes are low enough that they should not
interfere with precipitation.
Alkalinity, pH, and hardness are major factors to consider
when using chemical precipitation to remove phosphorusfrom wastewater. Iron phosphate and its oxyhydroxide com-plexes approach minimum solubility at pH ranges of 4.0 –6.0,
while aluminum phosphate and its oxyhydroxide complexesreach minimum solubility at a pH range of 5.0 –7.0. Because
of this, adjusting pH is generally not a major issue; however
both processes consume alkalinity, so adjustments may be
required depending on the source of the wastewater influent.Calcium apatite (Ca
10(PO 4)6(OH) 2) requires relatively high
pH (>9.0) to reach minimum solubility, which requires soft-ening of the wastewater through the formation of calcium
carbonate (CaCO
3). The formation of CaCO 3, coupled with
the intended precipitation of calcium apatite, dramatically
adds to the sludge production of the treatment facility [ 74].
In spite of this increase in sludge, experimental usage of cal-cium precipitation with wastewater effluent [ 78], anaerobic
digester liquor [ 79], and synthetic waste streams [ 80,81]
show phosphorus removal between 80 and 99 %, assumingelevated pH values are used.
While precipitation will reduce dissolved phosphorus, re-
use and recovery of the phosphate from the sludge is imprac-tical, unless tertiary infrastructure is in place to perform chem-ical reduction [ 6]. Precipitation without recovery also has the
negative effect of drastically increasing the amount of sludgeformed during primary and secondary treatment, especiallywhen using lime- or alum-based precipitation [ 82]. Even when
the majority of phosphorus has been precipitated out of solu-tion, residual calcium, aluminum, and iron salts will continueto precipitate with hydroxide; estimates show that sludge vol-
ume after chemical precipitation can increase by as much as
35 % [ 83].
One experimental attempt to recover calcium phosphate is
the Geestmerambacht enhanced biological treatment process.Using a fluidized bed reactor, seed particles of silica are intro-duced to the effluent, collecting calcium phosphate and
forming an easily extractable pellet. These pellets have rela-
tively high phosphorus content (up to 11 % as phosphorus),low water content (5 –10 %), and low heavy-metal impurities;
although they are not as concentrated as phosphate rock, theydo provide a clean source of phosphorus. Experimental data,however, shows lower phosphorus loading than models would
suggest, possibly due to interference from organic loading on
the silica seeds [ 84].
In addition to calcium phosphate, many wastewater treat-
ment plants have observed the natural formation of struvite,either in magnesium (MgNH
4PO4) or potassium (KNH 4PO4)
form. This precipitate forms spontaneously at elevated pH
levels (>8.0) when equal parts dissolved phosphate, ammoni-
um, and either magnesium or potassium enter a highly turbu-lent system, such as in the underground transfer pipe networks
of treatment facilities. Struvite is problematic for certain forms
of phosphorus production due to its ability to release ammoniagas and produce high nitrogen emission levels. However,
struvite can be used as a form of high-grade slow-release
fertilizer, which makes it ideal for preventing excessive phos-phorus concentrations in runoff [ 6]. Struvite formation has the
added benefit of not only reducing dissolved levels of phos-phorus and nitrogen but also in reducing hardness caused bymagnesium. In many cases, particularly those where animal
and agricultural waste is the main source of N and P, Mg must
be supplemented into the system to promote crystallization. Inrecent years, struvite recovery has been implemented in the
treatment of a variety of wastewater sources, including landfill
leachate [ 85], anaerobic digester effluent [ 86], as well as swine
[87,88], poultry [ 89], and fertilizer wastewater [ 90]. In all
cases, after the introduction of Mg, struvite recovery wasshown to be between 85 and 97 %.
High-Temperature Acid Hydrolysis
As phosphorus accounts for approximately 2 –3 % of the or-
ganic solids in typical primary and secondary wastewater
treatment sludge (higher if chemical precipitation is used),high-temperature acid hydrolysis and extraction of the phos-
phorus can be a viable option for some treatment facilities
[91]. Research performed by Hultman has shown that normal
wastewater treatment sludge that is dewatered, incinerated,
and then digested in hydrochloric acid (HCl) can release phos-
phorus in the usable form of phosphoric acid (H
3PO4)w i t hu p
to 85 % yield [ 92]. H 3PO4is a key element to modified solvent
extraction processes, which are essential to the developmentof feedstock. Acid hydrolysis does have the added drawbackof co-dissolving concentrated amounts of iron, aluminum,
calcium, and heavy metals alongside the phosphorus; recent
work with pH adjustments [ 93], sulfide precipitation [ 94], and
cation exchange [ 95] have helped reduce these contaminant
levels.
Sludge treatment can also be used to collect phosphorus in
alternative forms. The CAMBI/KREPRO
TMprocess uses
high-temperature acid hydrolysis to reduce sludge into ironphosphate and a concentrated sludge residue, which can be
used as a fertilizer and biofuel, respectively. This process has
proven successful in Helsingborg, Sweden, where a full-scale160 Curr Pollution Rep (2015) 1:155 –166pilot system has proven to be capable of handling 500 kg
TS/h with a 75 % recovery rate [ 92]. Additional work is
also being done to react iron phosphate with iron sulfide to
release soluble phosphates, which can then be used as a
hybrid hydrolysis/precipitation process to form calcium
phosphate or struvite. In some novel cases, the iron sulfideis being created on-site through sulfur-reducing microor-
ganisms, allowing both the reduction of phosphorus and
sulfur in the treated effluent [ 6].
Biological Assimilation
The use of constructed wetlands (CWs) for biological as-
similation of excess nutrients is a fairly new concept, with
Dr. Käthe Seidel conducting the first serious research intothe design of efficient wetlands in 1953, and the first full-
scale CW constructed in 1967 [96 ]. Since these first at-
tempts, CWs have been used to treat a wide range of
wastewaters, including effluent from domestic wastewa-
ters, dairy farms, palm oil pr oduction, distilleries, natural
rubber production, tanneries, textile manufacturing,
electroplating, pulp and paper p roduction, pesticide pro-
duction, and heavy metal production [97].
Depending on location and the wastewater being treated,
CWs can be categorized by their water level (free water sur-
face or subsurface flow), the types of plants used (free-float-
ing, floating-leaved, submerged, or emergent), and the flowdirection (horizontal, vertical downflow, or vertical upflow).
Nearly all CWs, however, use a combination of shallow water,
low flow velocity, dense vegetation, and long, narrow chan-nels to help create plug flow conditions to remove a wide
variety of wastewater contaminants [ 98]. Suspended solids
are removed through sedimentation, aggregation, and surface
adhesion, while settleable organics are removed by deposition
and filtration. Soluble organics are degraded aerobically and
anaerobically by suspended microbial growth, and oxygen isadded to the system through the air-water interface and the
plant life present in the CWs [ 99]. Nitrogen is removed
through nitrification/denitrification in aerobic and anaerobic
zones; ammonia is oxidized in aerobic zones, and nitrate is
converted to nitrogen gas and nitrous oxide in anoxic zones
[100].
Phosphorus can be removed through microbial and veg-
etative assimilatio n, precipitation with di/trivalent cations
in the soil/sediment, or adsorption onto clays and organic
matter. Phosphorus can also be stored in peat accumula-
tions. Subsurface CWs rarely precipitate or adsorb phos-phorus due to the fact that the media used (crushed stone or
pea gravel) is very low in iron, aluminum, and calcium,
although high-sorption media such as steel slag and lightweight clay aggregates do show promise for future CWs
[101]. Microbial assimilation of phosphorus is often high,
but it represents a short-term solution due to the highturnover rate of microbes in CWs [ 102]. The
temperature-dependent nature of many of these species re-
stricts their use to tropical and subtropical regions, howev-er [103]. This restriction prevents the use of biological
assimilation in cold climates, although pilot plants suchas the Houghton Lake Project in Ann Arbor, MI have beentested to develop stronger CW systems [ 104].
Because of these issues, biological assimilation through
plant and algae uptake is one of the only reliable long-termmethod for phosphorus removal in most CWs [ 102]. The most
common species of vegetation used for free-surface assimila-tion are Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth), Pistia
stratiotes (water lettuce), and several species of Lemnaceae
(duckweed); these aquatic plants can be harvested and sold asa source of nutrients in fish and animal feeds, while also re-moving as much as 83 –87 % total nitrogen and 70 –85 % total
phosphorus removal from the wastewater streams [ 105]. In
some places such as Ghana, fish and other aquaculturalmethods are being introduced to CWs that have high algae
content; in addition to the harvested plant matter, the fish
themselves thrive on the high-nutrient algae and can be soldfor a profit [ 106]. The conditions present in most CWs are
also favorable for the controlled growth of algae that can beused to develop biofuels such as biodiesel, biomethane, and
bioethanol [ 107,10
8 ].
Physical-Chemical Adsorption and Ion Exchange
Physical-chemical adsorption offers many benefits over alter-
native phosphorus removal methods. Depending on the sor-bent material, the attraction between sorbent and sorbate can
be either physical or chemical; physical sorption generally
uses van der Waals forces to attract the targeted solute, whilechemical sorption removes the targeted solute through a
chemical reaction [ 109].
Adsorption and ion exchange can be used either in the form
of a fixed-bed column system through which wastewater ispassed, or it can be dispersed throughout wastewater to be
settled out in a downstream clarifier. Dispersal is best usedwhen the sorbent material cannot be reused, if recovery of
the solute is not necessary, or if increasing sludge volume is
not a problem; powdered activated carbon is often used in thismanner. When appropriate sorbents are used, fixed-bed col-
umn systems have several major advantages over other
methods of phosphorus removal and recovery. Downstream
from the column, the wastewater effluent contains non-detect
or very low phosphorus concentrations until exhaustion of thesorbent is reached. Due to the physical nature of most com-
mercial sorbents, there is also no additional sludge formed.
The sorbent can also be regenerated and reused repeatedly,and phosphorus can be easily recovered from the regenerant
i nau s a b l ef o r ms u c ha ss t r u v i t e[ 110]. Except for periodic
cleaning, redirection of wastewater flow from exhaustion toCurr Pollution Rep (2015) 1:155 –166 161regeneration, and the subsequent removal of phosphorus from
regenerant, sorption is an entirely passive process that requires
little to no maintenance while running. A pilot-scale version ofthis process, called the REM NUT® process, was tested in
Massafra, Italy. The hybrid ion exchange/precipitation process
was able to remove ammonium, potassium, and orthophos-phates through the use of a mixed bed of cation and anion
exchange resins. Regeneration was performed using a
0.06 M NaCl solution, and the removed nutrients were thenprecipitated out as struvite through the addition of magnesium
[111].
Many different materials have been suggested as phos-
phorus adsorbents. Unfortunately, each material is subject-ed to limitations based on its own specific composition,
which makes it difficult to determine common removaland regeneration efficiencies. Ferric and aluminum hy-
droxides are common adsorbents, due to their ability to
form ligands with oxy-anions such as phosphates[112–114]. Recent research has also included phosphorussorption onto fly ash [ 115], blast furnace slags [ 116], gas
concrete [ 117], crushed oyster shell powder [ 118], alum
sludge [ 119], active red mud [ 120], synthetic boehmites
[121], and calcite [ 122].
Some common limitations to adsorption are the high
cost of the regenerant solutions and the sorbents them-selves, pretreatment of wastewater influent to function
within the specific sorbent’ s capabilities, and the safe dis-
posal of spent regenerant. Depending on the sorbent and
regenerant used, these can be overcome through several
means. Sorbents made from the waste products of other
processes, like blast furnace slags and alum sludge, bring
the cost of materials down. Precipitating phosphorus out of
regenerant allows for the continued recycling and reuse of
the solution. Using nonhazardous regenerant solutions,like seawater at a neutral pH, also reduces the need for
hazardous waste disposal [ 30,110].

Macronutrients nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for life
on the earth. However, their removal from waste streams is
also critical to mitigate the environmental problem of eutro-
phication of water-receiving bodies. A plethora of technolo-gies exists that can achieve this goal; however, biological ni-
trification and de-nitrification and chemical precipitation are
the most common processes used today to remove nitrogenand phosphorus, respectivel y. But both processes cannot
achieve recovery of nitrogen or phosphorus. As readily ex-tractable phosphorus deposits dwindle, and energy footprintplays an increasing role in nitrogenous fertilizer production,
recovery of nitrogen and Phosphorus from waste stream is
increasingly growing in importance. This practice is in align-ment with a paradigm shift where the waste stream is not just
to be looked upon as a cost item (to remove pollutants from it
in order that environmental regulations are met) but as a car-rier of extractable resources.
This paper presents an exhaustive review of processing
technologies that can meet the goal of recovering Nitrogenand Phosphorus from a waste stream. Future research is need-
ed to combine fundamental understanding with adaptation of
technology for particular site/wastewater.
