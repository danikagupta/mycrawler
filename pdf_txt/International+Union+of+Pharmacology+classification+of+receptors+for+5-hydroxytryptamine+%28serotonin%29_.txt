Alternative splicing and RNA editing add to this diversity. Most of 5-HT receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family except for 5-HT3 receptors that are ionic channels. Their activation gives rise to a huge complexity of intracellular signaling events that depend or not on G protein activation and underlie the diversity of physiological functions of 5-HT.  Assembly of 5-HT receptors into heteromers with distinct 5-HT receptors or other GPCRs, as well as their physical association with protein partners further increase the versatility of serotonergic signaling and the complexity of its regulation. These interactions also offer novel opportunities for therapeutic interventions in disorders related to dysfunctions of serotonergic systems.   Keywords Serotonin, receptor, G protein, signaling, structure, heteromer, interactome, pharmacology      - 3 -  Introduction Among the most ancient signaling molecules, it is not surprising to find amino acids (such as glutamate and GABA) and their derivatives such as serotonin (5-hydrotryptamine, 5-HT). 5-HT is present in plants and seeds. Since its discovery in Cowhage (Mucuna pruriens) in the 1950s, 5-HT has been found in more than 90 plant species, including banana, pineapple and walnuts (Erland et al., 2016). Banana skin contains 10 times more 5-HT than mammalian hippocampus. In addition to its anti-oxidant properties, 5-HT plays many physiological roles in plants such as growth, control of seasonal cycles, delay of senescence and responses to stress. However, no 5-HT receptors have been found in plants. It is only with the apparition of synapses 600 millions years ago that 5-HT receptors appeared in coelenterates (Cnidaria) (Hajj-Ali & Anctil, 1997). Their expansion was very rapid. Seven 5-HT receptor subtypes are present in Caenorhabditis elegans, four in mollusks (Aplysia), and four or five in Drosophila melanogaster, honeybees (Apis mellifera) and crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) (Blenau & Thamm, 2011).   In invertebrates, particularly in insects, the classification and denomination of 5-HT receptors is based on the comparison of their primary sequences with those of vertebrate 5-HT receptors. Thus, drosophila and honeybee express homologues of vertebrate 5-HT1 (5-HT1A and 5-HT1B), 5-HT2 (5-HT2A and 5-HT2B) and 5-HT7 receptors. With regard to evolution, it is worthy to note that invertebrate 5-HT1 and 5-HT7 receptors inhibit and stimulate cAMP production, respectively, reminiscent of vertebrate receptors. Due to the low interest of pharmaceutical companies for invertebrate 5-HT receptors, there are only a few drugs available for their characterization. Genetics and behavioral studies in invertebrates showed that 5-HT receptors are involved in important physiological functions, including sleep, associative learning, circadian rhythms, aggressive and social behaviors (Blenau & Thamm, 2011). The most spectacular effect of 5-HT upon social behavior is its ability to induce in a few hours a switch from solitary to gregarious behavior in desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) (Anstey et al., 2009; Rogers & Ott, 2015).     - 4 -  In vertebrates, the classification of 5-HT receptors started in 1953 with the description by Gaddum of the antagonist effect of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on 5-HT-elicited responses in several in vitro pharmacological tests (Gaddum, 1953). The psychotropic and hallucinogenic effects of LSD were known since April 1943, when Albert Hofmann was disturbed by unusual sensations and hallucinations after he accidentally ingested the drug.  In 1957, Gaddum and Picarelli proposed the first classification of 5-HT receptors. 5-HT-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were blocked in part by dibenziline (D), an irreversible blocker of SH groups, and in part by morphine (M). They proposed that two receptors were involved, the D and M receptors localized on smooth muscle and nerve ganglia, respectively (Gaddum & Picarelli, 1957) (Figure 1). We know, today, that D receptors correspond to muscle 5-HT2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (Bradley et al., 1986) whereas the M receptor corresponds to presynaptic cation-gated channels (5-HT3 receptors) (Derkach et al., 1989).  In the 1970s and early 1980s, two novel methods based on new tools allowed a rapid advance in the discovery and classification of neurotransmitter receptors in general and of 5-HT receptors in particular. The first one was the binding of radiolabelled ligands on tissues. With regard to 5-HT receptors, the first ligands used were [3H]-5-HT, [3H]-LSD and [3H]-spiperone (a D2 and 5-HT2A antagonist) and were followed by many others (Bennett & Aghajanian, 1974; Fillion et al., 1976; Hoyer et al., 1994; Peroutka et al., 1979, 1981; Peroutka & Snyder, 1979). The second method was the measurement of second messenger (cyclic AMP, inositol triphosphate (IP3), Ca2+) production in cells or isolated membranes to monitor and pharmacologically characterize 5-HT-induced responses (Bockaert et al., 2006; Bockaert et al., 2008; Bouhelal et al., 1988; Dumuis et al., 1988). This last approach had the advantage of revealing immediately the agonist or antagonist nature of the compounds tested. This pharmacological period clearly characterized 4 classes of receptors (5-HT1 to 5-HT4) and most of their subtypes (Hoyer et al., 1994) (Figure 1). In 1988, the first 5-HT receptor (5-HT1A) was cloned (Fargin et al., 1988), launching the cloning period. In addition to the cloning of 5-HT receptors belonging to pharmacologically defined classes, three receptors (the 5-HT5, 5-HT6  - 5 -  and 5-HT7 receptors)   were cloned. In total, at least 14 receptor subtypes have been cloned. All are GPCRs except for 5-HT3 receptors that are ionic channels (Derkach et al., 1989; Hoyer et al., 1994; McCorvy & Roth, 2015) (Figure 1).  I- The four 5-HT receptor classes discovered before the cloning era  At the beginning of the 70s, there has been a great development of what was called “binding experiments” for searching and characterizing hormone and then neurotransmitter receptors. Laboratories used radioactive ligands, labeled with tritium [3H] or iodine (generally [125I]) to detect and pharmacologically characterize receptors. The three pioneer laboratories in binding experiments in the 5-HT receptor field are those of Fillion who used [3H]-5-HT (Fillion et al., 1976), Aghajanian who used [3H]-LSD (Bennett & Aghajanian, 1974) and Snyder who used both ligands together with [3H]-spiperone (Peroutka et al., 1981). Peroutka and Snyder demonstrated that [3H]-5-HT binds with a high affinity (nM) to a class of 5-HT receptors designated as 5-HT1, whereas [3H]-spiperone, and later on [3H]-ketanserin, bind to another receptor, the 5-HT2 receptor that has high affinity for spiperone but a low affinity (µM) for 5-HT (Peroutka et al., 1981; Peroutka & Snyder, 1979). [3H]-LSD binds to both receptors. 5-HT1 class 5-HT1 receptors were rapidly subdivided into 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors (Figure 1). The 5-HT1A receptor was first described as the [3H]-5-HT binding displaced by spiperone (Pedigo et al., 1981). Thereafter, 8-OH-DPAT, a selective and high-affinity 5-HT1A receptor ligand, was discovered (Middlemiss & Fozard, 1983) and radiolabelled by Gozlan et al. (Gozlan et al., 1983). Further studies showed that 5-HT1A receptor stimulation inhibits cAMP production in both hippocampal membranes (De Vivo & Maayani, 1986) and primary neurons (Bockaert et al., 1987; Weiss et al., 1986).  In contrast, 5-HT1B receptor corresponded to [3H]-5-HT binding not displaced by spiperone or 8-OH-DPAT and labeled with [125I]-cyanopindolol, a  b-adrenergic blocker (Hoyer et al., 1985). We found that this presynaptic receptor is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase in substantia nigra (Bouhelal et al., 1988). Initially, all binding experiments on 5-HT1B receptor  - 6 -  were done in rodents. However, the surprise came when it was found that [125I]-cyanopindolol does not bind to 5-HT1B receptor in guinea-pig, pig, and human brain. Thereafter, a receptor having very similar pharmacological properties (except for its low affinity for b-adrenergic antagonists) and the same ability to inhibit 5-HT release and cAMP production in those species was described. This receptor thought to be present only in some species such as pig and human (Hoyer & Middlemiss, 1989; Schoeffter & Hoyer, 1989) was called 5-HT1D. The cloning of two genes (initially called HT1RDa and HT1RDb) in human that share very similar sequences and encode receptors with common 5-HT1B/D pharmacology led to the proposal that the 5-HT1B receptor is coded by the HT1RDb gene whereas the 5-HT1D receptor is coded by the HT1RDa gene in all species. It was later found that the absence of binding of [125I]-cyanopindolol to the human 5-HT1B receptor is due to a single residue difference in the transmembrane 7 (TM7) (an asparagine in human and a threonine in rodents). The current gene nomenclature is HTR1B and HTR1D for the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. The 5-HT1B receptor is largely predominant in terms of expression and function. The anti-migraine drug Sumatriptan, which was developed as a selective “5-HT1-like” receptor agonist, is in fact a 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist (Humphrey, 2008). However, triptans may also interact with 5-HT1F sites (Waeber & Moskowitz, 1995) (see below). Whether the effects of sumatriptan are mediated by vascular vs. neuronal receptors is still a matter of debate. The 5-HT1C receptor had a brief existence in the 5-HT1 class. Found in choroid plexus and later on in many brain areas using [3H]-5-HT binding, it was rapidly shown to be coupled to phospholipase C (PLC), as shown for 5-HT2A receptors (Berg et al., 1998). After its cloning, it became evident that it has high sequence homology with 5-HT2 receptors and a similar pharmacology. The 5-HT1C receptor was thus definitely classified in the 5-HT2 family and renamed 5-HT2C receptor.   5-ht1E binding sites were first discovered using [3H]-5-HT binding in human frontal cortical tissue and then in bovine but not in rat brain (Leonhardt et al., 1989). Their high affinity for [3H]-5-HT and low affinity for drugs displaying affinity for 5-HT2 receptors (i.e. mesulergine) led to its classification as a 5-HT1 receptor. Its weak affinity for the prototypical 5-HT1 receptor  - 7 -  agonist, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), categorized it as a new member of the 5-HT1 class (Leonhardt et al., 1989). A receptor with similar pharmacological properties to the 5-HT1E binding sites (Levy et al., 1992) and thus named 5-HT1E receptor was then cloned. However, the subsequently cloned 5-HT1F shares a high degree of homology and pharmacology similarities with the 5-ht1E binding sites, compared to other 5-HT receptors (Adham et al., 1993) and it is likely that the initially identified 5-ht1E binding sites correspond to both 5-HT1E and 5-HT1F receptors. No drugs that can discriminate between these two receptor subtypes are currently available. 5-HT2 class  The 5-HT2A receptors correspond to the 5-HT2 receptors initially identified as [3H]-spiperone and [3H]-ketanserin binding sites with low (micromolar) affinity for 5-HT and the "D receptor" identified by Gaddum and Picarelli (Peroutka & Snyder, 1979). They are not only expressed in the brain but also at the periphery, especially in platelets where they mediate aggregation and in smooth muscles where they trigger contraction.  The 5-HT2B receptor was first characterized in rat stomach fundus where it stimulates muscle contraction and was transiently named “5-HT1F”. Its pharmacology has some similarities to that of 5-HT2C receptors. After its cloning in 1992 in rodents (Foguet et al., 1992) and human (Hoyer et al., 1994; McCorvy & Roth, 2015), it became clear that this receptor belongs to the 5-HT2 class but is distinct from 5-HT2C receptors. It was thus named 5-HT2B receptor (Figure 1). It has a wide distribution pattern both at the periphery and the brain (McCorvy & Roth, 2015). Activation of 5-HT2B receptor is responsible for abnormal echocardiograms, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac valve deficiencies triggered by the fenfluramine metabolite norfenfluramine, a drug inducing a weight loss initially marketed by Wyeth (Roth, 2007).  The discovery and pharmacological characteristics of the 5-HT2C receptor that was first thought to belong to the 5-HT1 class, are described above.    - 8 -  5-HT3 class Initially named “M receptors” by Gaddum and Picarelli (Gaddum & Picarelli, 1957), 5-HT3 receptors have been extensively studied for three decades in the periphery before the discovery that they are cation channels (Derkach et al., 1989) and that a radiolabelled compound ([3H]-ICS 205-930 (tropisetron, 31-tropanyll-lH-indole-3-carboxylic acid ester) (Waeber et al., 1989) could be used for studying their distribution. 5-HT3 receptors show a wide distribution in the brain, are responsible for the depolarizing effects of 5-HT and mediate peripheral neuronal transmitter release, emesis and nociception (Hoyer et al., 1994; Waeber et al., 1989). Five genes encoding 5-HT3 receptor subunits (5-HT3A-E) have been cloned in human and some other vertebrates (but not in rodents), while 5-HT3 receptors seem to be absent in invertebrates (Niesler et al., 2008) (Figure 1). These subunits have a high level of homology with other members of the Cys-Cys loop ligand-gated channel superfamily (e.g. nicotinic, GABAA and glycine receptors). However, the most studied ones are 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B receptors. Native 5-HT3 receptors have a pentameric structure, as revealed by electron microscopy (Boess et al., 1995). In order to form an active receptor, at least one 5-HT3A subunit has to be present. Functional receptors can be formed by co-assembling 5-HT3A subunits only, whereas receptors exclusively composed of 5-HT3B subunits are not functional (Barnes & Sharp, 1999). Native 5-HT3 receptors are likely a co-assembling of 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B subunits and, possibly, some 5-HT3C-E subunits. The stoichiometry of the different subunits constituting native pentameric receptors has not yet been clearly determined (Niesler et al., 2008). 5-HT4 receptor In contrast to other G protein-coupled 5-HT receptors, the 5-HT4 receptor has been discovered through its capacity to stimulate production of cAMP. Our laboratory identified an atypical 5-HT receptor positively coupled to the adenylyl cyclase both in colliculi neurons (Dumuis et al., 1988) and guinea-pig hippocampus (Bockaert et al., 1990). It was insensitive to 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists and was inhibited (with a very low affinity) by some, but not all, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Since it was obviously not a 5-HT1-3 receptor, it was named “5-HT4 receptor” (Figure 1). 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chloro benzamides such as metoclopramide or  - 9 -  cisapride are potent agonists of the 5-HT4 receptor (Dumuis et al., 1989). This pharmacology was sufficient to propose that the 5-HT4 receptor described in neurons was similar to a gastro-prokinetic 5-HT receptor insensitive to 5-HT1-3 antagonists and stimulated by benzamides in guinea-pig ileum and more largely in gastro-intestinal tract (Bockaert et al., 1992). 5-HT4 receptor agonists have been commercialized for gastro-intestinal problems such as idiopathic constipation and gastro-oesophagial reflux (Bockaert et al., 2008). A recent study showed that gut bacteria are able to produce tryptamine and to increase gastrointestinal transit by activating peripheral 5-HT4 receptors (Bhattarai et al., 2018). De Vadder et al. demonstrated that maturation of peripheral nervous system is likewise under the control of gut microbiota through 5-HT release and 5-HT4 receptor activation (De Vadder et al., 2018). In brain, several pathologies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), feeding disorders and depression, might benefit from 5-HT4 receptor-directed therapies (Bockaert et al., 2011; Claeysen et al., 2012). Chronic administration of 5-HT4 receptor agonists decreases the amyloid pathology and prevents the appearance of cognitive deficits in a mouse model of AD (Baranger et al., 2017; Giannoni et al., 2013). In line with these results, an innovative multitarget-directed ligand, named donecopride, has been developed against AD. This molecule simultaneously activates 5-HT4 receptors and inhibits acetylcholinesterase (Lecoutey et al., 2014; Rochais et al., 2015). II- The three 5-HT receptor classes discovered by homology cloning The cloning of rhodopsin and some adrenergic and muscarinic receptors revealed the existence of a GPCR family that shares high sequence similarity throughout their seven transmembrane domains. Using cross-hybridization at reduced stringency with the full length b2-adrenergic receptor, Fargin et al. (Fargin et al., 1988) cloned the first 5-HT receptor (the 5-HT1A receptor). Thereafter, the cloning of 5-HT1-4 receptors described in the previous chapter by using similar technologies was quite rapid. However, some clones did not correspond to previously described receptors and thus allowed the discovery of three novel 5-HT receptors, the 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors.  5-HT5 receptors In 1992, Plassat et al. cloned a new 5-HT receptor with a sequence quite different from those  - 10 -  of the previously identified 5-HT receptors and that display a high affinity for LSD (Plassat et al., 1992). Therefore, they named it 5-HT5 (now 5-HT5A). The same laboratory cloned one year later a second 5-HT5 receptor that was called 5-ht5B (Matthes et al., 1993). The development of 5-HT5A receptor pharmacological tools has been difficult but led to the quite selective antagonists SB699551 (Corbett et al., 2005) and ASP5736 (Yamazaki et al., 2014) that are now widely used in functional studies. The distribution of 5-HT5A receptors suggests a possible role in emotion regulation, cognition, anti-nociception, and control of circadian rhythm (Plassat et al., 1992). RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the expression of this receptor is restricted to the brain and the testis (Fagerberg et al., 2014). In contrast to the 5-HT5A receptor, the 5-ht5B was not conserved during evolution and leads to a pseudogene in human (Grailhe et al., 2001). 5-HT6 receptor  It is also in the 1990s that the 5-HT6 receptor was originally cloned in rat (Monsma et al., 1993; Ruat, Traiffort, Arrang, et al., 1993) and a few years later in human (Kohen et al., 1996) and mouse (Kohen et al., 2001). It is almost exclusively detected in brain. Selective agonists including WAY181187, WAY208466 (Schechter et al., 2008) and ST1936 (Borsini et al., 2015) as well as antagonists such as SB258585, SB271046 and SB399885 (Hirst et al., 2006) have been synthetized. [125I]-SB258585 is the most selective radioligand available (Hirst et al., 2006). Studies of brain distribution of 5-HT6 receptors, assessed by mRNA localization, [125I]-SB258585 binding and immunohistochemistry, indicate their presence in hypothalamus, hippocampus, mesencephalon, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, with the higher density in dorsal striatum in rat and human but not in mice (Gerard et al., 1997; Hirst et al., 2003; Marazziti et al., 2013). The neuronal expression profile indicates localization in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the cortex (in particular GABAergic neurons that express 5-HT3 receptors) and the hippocampus. In the striatum, 5-HT6 receptors are found in medium sized spiny neurons expressing D1 or D2 dopaminergic receptors and some cholinergic neurons (Helboe et al., 2015). Further studies revealed that 5-HT6 receptors are mainly located in primary cilium and also in dendrites (Brailov et al., 2000; Brodsky et al., 2017). A specific sequence in the third intracellular loop of the mouse 5-HT6 receptor and other GPCRs known  - 11 -  to be targeted in primary cilium has been demonstrated to be responsible for this intriguing localization (Berbari et al., 2008). Preclinical studies revealed that 5-HT6 receptor blockade induces pro-cognitive effects in a wide range of cognition paradigms in rodents, raising some hope that 5-HT6 receptors could be an interesting target for treating cognitive deficits of neuropsychiatric disorders such as AD and other dementia (de Jong & Mork, 2017) as well as schizophrenia (Meffre et al., 2012). However, a first clinical trial of Idalopirdine, a 5-HT6 receptor antagonist developed by Lundbeck/Otsuka, given in association with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Donepezil, failed in Phase III for AD (Mullard, 2016). Two others trials are on-going. Similarly, a Phase IIb trial performed with another antagonist developed by Axovant, Intepirdine (SB742458), in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, was also negative. The 5-HT6 receptor has also been proposed as target for the treatment of depression (Svenningsson et al., 2007) and obesity (Heal et al., 2008). 5-HT7 receptor  The 5-HT7 was the last 5-HT receptor to be cloned from 1993 by several groups in mouse (Plassat et al., 1993), rat (Lovenberg et al., 1993; Meyerhof et al., 1993; Ruat, Traiffort, Leurs, et al., 1993) human (Bard et al., 1993), guinea-pig (Tsou et al., 1994) and pig (Bhalla et al., 2002). “5-HT7 like” receptors have also been cloned in Xenopus laevis (Nelson et al., 1995), C. elegans (Hobson et al., 2003) and honeybee (Schlenstedt et al., 2006). The pharmacology of 5-HT7 receptors is characterized by a high affinity for agonists generally known to act on 5-HT1 receptors, such as 5-carboxytryptamine and 8-OH-DPAT, and antagonists known to act on 5-HT2 receptors, such as cyproheptadine and clozapine. Crystal structure of the 5-HT7 receptor should reveal the residues responsible for this singularity. Notably, LSD, which is an agonist (often partial) of most 5-HT receptor subtypes, is an antagonist of the 5-HT7 receptor (Wacker et al., 2013). The most potent and selective 5-HT7 receptor agonists are the aminotetraline derivatives AS19 and E-55888 (Brenchat et al., 2009). SB269970 is the prototypic 5-HT7 receptor antagonist that has been used as a radiolabelled form ([3H]-SB269970) in binding experiments (Hagan et al., 2000; D. R. Thomas et al., 2000). In human, high 5-HT7 receptor density was found in thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen and  - 12 -  substantia nigra (Varnas et al., 2004). Immunohistochemistry confirmed this localization and showed additional expression in suprachiasmatic nuclei (Neumaier et al., 2001), spinal cord dorsal horn (Doly et al., 2005) and myenteric neurons (Tonini et al., 2005). Experiments using selective antagonists and sometimes 5-HT7 receptor knockout mice have implicated this receptor in numerous CNS functions, including neuronal morphogenesis, circadian rhythm, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, thermoregulation, and memory (Matthys et al., 2011). 5-HT7 receptor antagonists have been suggested to be of interest for the treatment of cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. They attenuate reversal learning deficits as well as deficit in novel object recognition induced by phencyclidine (PCP) treatment in the rat (Horiguchi et al., 2011; McLean et al., 2009). Blockade of 5-HT7 receptors may also have therapeutic implications for treating negative symptoms in schizophrenia since SB269970 administration ameliorates both ketamine and PCP-induced social withdrawal in rats (Nikiforuk et al., 2013). On the other hand, activation of 5-HT7 receptors corrects molecular, electrophysiological, and behavior abnormalities in mice models of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) (Costa et al., 2015). Finally, in rat models of neuropathic pain, SB269970 reduces hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia (Amaya-Castellanos et al., 2011). III- Some light on the pharmacology and signaling of 5-HT receptors given by their 3D structure Several 5-HT receptor structures have been solved by X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM (Garcia-Nafria et al., 2018; Hassaine et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2018; Wacker et al., 2013; Wacker et al., 2017; C. Wang et al., 2013). 5-HT1B receptors have been crystallized in presence of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (C. Wang et al., 2013), the 5-HT2B receptor in presence of ergotamine (Wacker et al., 2013) and LSD (Wacker et al., 2017) and the 5-HT2C receptor in presence of ergotamine and ritanserin, an inverse agonist (Peng et al., 2018). The ergotamine binding site in 5-HT1B receptors is defined by helices III, V, VI, and the extracellular loop (ecl)2. It includes two pockets, an orthosteric pocket equivalent to that of other aminergic GPCRs and an extended pocket localized less deeply within the receptor that binds the cyclic tripeptide moiety of ergotamine (Figure 2A) (Wacker et al., 2013). The ergoline ring of  - 13 -  ergotamine, as 5-HT, binds to the receptor through a salt bridge formed between its positively charged nitrogen and the conserved D1293.32. A hydrophobic cleft, composed of C1333.36, I1303.33, W3276.48, F3306.51 and F3316.52 side chains, packs the planar ergoline ring. The orthosteric pocket of the 5HT2B receptor is very similar to that of the 5-HT1B receptor. The extended pocket of the 5-HT1B receptor located above the orthosteric pocket is broader than that of the 5-HT2B receptor, because the equivalent of M2185.39 in the 5-HT2B receptor is a smaller threonine residue (T2095.39) (C. Wang et al., 2013). The phenyl ring of the cyclic tripeptide moiety of ergotamine contacts with L3476.58 and V3486.59 in the 5-HT2B receptor, whereas it rotates to occupy a cavity close to T2095.39 at helix V in the 5-HT1B receptor (Figure 2B). The extended pocket in the 5-HT1B receptor described above receives the large substitution at the 5’ position of the indole of triptans, the most frequently prescribed anti-migraine medications, whereas the narrow pocket of the 5-HT2B receptor is not favorable for the binding of these drugs (C. Wang et al., 2013). Simulation of norfenfluramine binding to 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptors indicates that in the 5-HT2B receptor, F2175.38 and M2185.39 form a hydrophobic pocket otherwise absent in the 5-HT1B receptor, which receives the trifluoromethyl group of norfenfluramine (C. Wang et al., 2013). One of the interesting characteristics of ergotamine and LSD is their potent arrestin-biased signaling vs. Gq signaling at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. The high residency of LSD in 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors (more than 200 min) and the slow but important recruitment of arrestin that is important for LSD hallucinogenic effects is due to LSD interaction with the ecl2 loop (L209 in the 5-HT2B receptor) forming a lid above the binding site (Wacker et al., 2017). Cryo-EM structure of agonist-bound 5-HT1B receptor coupled to Go indicates that the intracellular domain of the receptor is in a similar conformation to that observed for other amine receptors in complex with Gs, but with a smaller receptor:G protein interface, suggesting difference in coupling and signaling kinetics (Garcia-Nafria et al., 2018). Crystallization of the 5-HT2C receptor bound to ergotamine (Peng et al., 2018) confirmed the binding orthosteric pocket of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptors and provided a complete resolution of extracellular loops that were disordered in the other serotonin receptor crystal structures  - 14 -  (Peng et al., 2018) (Figure 2C). The 5-HT2C-ritanserin crystals revealed the inactive form of serotonin receptors, a conformation close to the inactive state structure of b2-adrenergic receptor (Rasmussen et al., 2011). Interestingly and compared with the orthosteric pocket in other aminergic receptors, the inverse agonist ritanserin bound to one helical turn deeper in the transmembrane domains (Peng et al., 2018) (Figure 2D). This deep pocket includes interactions with residues F3286.52 and W3246.48, two key elements of GPCR activation by “toggle switch” of helix VI. The deep binding of ritanserin seems to prevent this activation switch, highlighting inverse agonist action mode on this receptor.  IV- Gene structure of 5-HT receptors and editing The gene structure of human 5-HT receptors differs between receptor classes (Figure 3), in line with their phylogeny (Barnes & Sharp, 1999). Only 5-HT1 receptors are encoded by monointronic genes. The coding sequences of 5-HT2 receptors are split into three to four exons. Splicing site positions are conserved between 5-HT2A-C receptors. 5-HT3 receptors genes are highly fragmented and two to five splice variants have been actually described for each gene, with the exception of 5-HT3C receptor gene. Most of these splice variants differ in the N-terminal region of the protein. The 5-HT2A receptor gene presents an in frame internal splicing site, leading to different coding sequences within the transmembrane domains III and IV. The fragmented gene of the 5-HT4 receptor gene encodes at least ten splice variants (Bender et al., 2000). Nine of them differ in the length and composition of the C-terminal domain after a common splicing site. An internal in-frame splice variant, in combination with the 5-HT4(b) isoform has also been described. This alternative modification of ecl2 might combine with all the C-terminal variations, leading to a plethora of possibilities. The 5-HT5A and 5-HT6 receptors are encoded by two and three exons, respectively, whereas the 5-ht5B receptor has been lost during evolution and corresponds to a pseudogene in human (Grailhe et al., 2001). Similarly to the 5-HT4 receptor, three C-terminal splice variants are generated from a common splicing site in the 5-HT7 receptor gene.  In addition to the 5-HT receptors and splice variants encoded by the 17 human genes, RNA editing of the 5-HT2C receptor generates additional diversity. Five positions in its second coding  - 15 -  exon can undergo adenosine to inosine (A to I) substitution: four major sites termed A to D and one less-frequent site, termed E. The second intracellular loop of the receptor is then theoretically capable of presenting 24 different variations from the non-edited form (INI) to the fully edited form (VGV) (Fitzgerald et al., 1999). Editing of the 5-HT2C receptor is tissue-specific and regulated by 5-HT. Low levels of 5-HT favor the expression of forms presenting a high affinity for 5-HT (Gurevich, Englander, et al., 2002). In suicide patients, altered editing of the 5-HT2C receptor results in the expression of edited receptor forms exhibiting decreased basal activity and decreased agonist affinity and potency (Gurevich, Tamir, et al., 2002). In addition to its role in major depression, altered editing of the 5-HT2C receptor has been reported in Prader-Willy syndrome patients (Glatt-Deeley et al., 2010) and autistic individuals (Eran et al., 2013).  V- Canonical signaling events engaged by 5-HT receptors 5-HT1A receptor A wealth of information on 5-HT1A receptor signaling has been collected through transfection of the receptor in diverse heterologous systems. In most models, its activation of Gai leads to the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, lowering intracellular cAMP concentration (Figure 4A). However, other pathways seem to be involved in the regulation of cAMP levels by 5-HT1A receptors. Indeed, 5-HT1A receptor can increase cAMP formation in cellular models expressing the adenylyl cyclase II variant, including hippocampal neurons (Albert et al., 1999; Cadogan et al., 1994; Shenker et al., 1987). One of the principal 5-HT1A receptor effectors is the G protein-gated inward rectifying gK+ (GIRK) channel (Figure 4), which opens following the stimulation of 5-HT1A receptor, leading to the inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Interestingly, this functional coupling between 5-HT1A receptors and GIRK channels is enhanced in tyrosine hydroxylase 2 knockout mice, which exhibit a functional sensitization of 5-HT1A receptors (Mlinar et al., 2017). Heterologous expression of 5-HT1A receptor in HeLa cells, as well as endogenous expression of the receptor in Jurkat cells can lead to activation of Gbg, which stimulates PLC, leading to the production of IP3 and diacyl glycerol (DAG) (Raymond et al., 1999). Remarkably, endogenous 5-HT1A receptors can have opposite effects on signaling  - 16 -  pathways depending on where they are expressed. For example, they can activate Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK)1/2 in the hypothalamus in a Calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner, similar to what is observed in heterologous systems (Della Rocca et al., 1999; Turner et al., 2007), whereas they inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the hippocampus (Crane et al., 2007). In contrast, an activation of the Akt pathway has been demonstrated in the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), where an activation of the mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) has also been described (Cowen et al., 2005; Fukumoto et al., 2018a, 2018b). In the same brain area, activation of 5-HT1A receptors leads to the inhibition of NMDA transmission, an effect that seems to require the Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)4 function to be inhibited, which suggests a coupling between RGS4 and 5-HT1A receptor (Figure 4A) (Gu et al., 2007). 5-HT1A receptor stimulation transactivates PDGFβ receptors in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and primary cortical neurons, providing a signaling link between the serotonergic system and growth factors in neurons. This transactivation pathway is Pertussis toxin-sensitive and depends on Src tyrosine kinase, PLC and intracellular Ca2+ (Kruk et al., 2013). Another source of diversity for 5-HT1A receptor signaling comes from the difference in the pharmacology as well as the ability of the receptor to desensitize depending on its presynaptic vs. postsynaptic localization. 5-HT1A receptors have also been shown to stimulate nitric oxide synthase (NOS), Nicotinamide Dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-like enzyme, and Protein Kinase C (PKC) (Adayev et al., 2003; Polter & Li, 2010; Raymond et al., 1999). 5-HT1B/D/E/F receptors Unlike the 5-HT1A receptor that is expressed in somato-dendritic compartment, 5-HT1B receptors are preferentially located on axon terminals, where their activation potentiates serotonin reuptake (Montanez et al., 2014). Endogenous 5-HT1B receptors are coupled to Gi/o proteins, leading to the inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase pathway. This has been demonstrated first in the substantia nigra (Bouhelal et al., 1988) and then confirmed in other brain areas such as the hippocampus (Lu et al., 2018). In addition, heterologous expression of the receptor showed a possible regulation of PLC and PLD, Akt, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and ERK1/2 (Raymond et al., 2001). 5-HT1B receptor stimulation also inhibits Ca2+ channels and  - 17 -  activates K+ channels.  Little is known about the signal transduction of other 5-HT1 receptor subtypes. Studies in heterologous systems showed that they are also negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. The 5-HT1D receptor has recently been shown to activate an axin1-bcatenin-metalloproteinase-7 pathway, promoting tumor invasion in colorectal cancer (Sui et al., 2015). Other evidences of a role for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in cancer dissemination through the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been shown. In pancreatic cancer, the knockdown of both 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors using RNA interference significantly decreases cell invasion. This results from a decrease in the MMP2 and integrin/Src/FAK signaling pathway (Gurbuz et al., 2014). 5-HT2A receptor The 5-HT2A receptor is canonically coupled to the Gaq/11 proteins and thus activates PLC (Conn & Sanders-Bush, 1984), leading to IP3 and DAG production and the activation of PKC  (Figure 4B). 5-HT2A receptor-mediated PKC activation leads to the phosphorylation of presynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors and postsynaptic GluA2-containing AMPA receptors, to gate synaptic plasticity at thalamo-cortical synapses (Barre et al., 2016; Berthoux et al., 2018). 5-HT2A receptor activation by hallucinogenic agonists such as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) also leads to the activation of a Gai/o-Src pathway in PFC neurons, whereas receptor stimulation by non-hallucinogenic agonists such as ergotamine and the anti-Parkinson agent lisuride only triggers the activation of the Gq-PLC pathway (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2007). These differences in signaling mechanisms elicited by both agonist categories leads to specific patterns of gene expression in cortical neurons: both agonist subclasses induce c-fos expression in neurons expressing 5-HT2A receptors, while only hallucinogens induce egr-1 and egr-2 expression (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2007). Intriguingly, only hallucinogenic agonists induce 5-HT2A receptor phosphorylation at the serine residue (Ser280) located in its third intracellular loop, an effect underlying the lower propensity of hallucinogens to promote receptor desensitization and internalization, compared with non-hallucinogenic agonists (Karaki et al., 2014). This biased phosphorylation and attenuated  - 18 -  desensitization of receptor may be responsible for more sustained receptor activation by hallucinogens vs. non-hallucinogenic agonists that might underlie their different behavioral outcomes. Collectively, these findings suggest that hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic agonists induce different conformational states of the 5-HT2A receptor and represent a striking example of functional selectivity translated into contrasting patterns of behavior (Gonzalez-Maeso & Sealfon, 2009). 5-HT2A receptors activate several other pathways, including PLA2 (Barclay et al., 2011) and PLD (Figure 4B) (Felder et al., 1990). Interestingly, PLD activation occurs through a mechanism independent of heterotrimeric G proteins that requires a physical interaction between the receptor C-terminal domain and PLD1 (Felder et al., 1990). As many GPCRs, 5-HT2A receptor stimulation also induces activation of ERK1/2 pathway in various cell types, including neurons. Highlighting another example of functional selectivity at the 5-HT2A receptor, activation of ERK1/2 by the 5-HT precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) depends on b-arrestin2, whereas DOI-elicited ERK1/2 phosphorylation is b-arrestin-independent (Schmid et al., 2008). Likewise, 5-HTP but not N-methyltryptamines induces Akt stimulation through a b-arrestin2-dependent mechanism (Schmid & Bohn, 2010). Furthermore, the hallucinogenic-like effects, e.g. the head twitch response, induced by 5-HTP is b-arrestin-dependent, whereas DOI or N-methyltryptamines elicit similar behavioral responses in wild type and b-arrestin2 knockout mice (Schmid & Bohn, 2010; Schmid et al., 2008). b-arrestin-dependent ERK1/2 activation has also been involved in the counteractive effect of 5-HT2A receptors on 5-HT1A receptor-operated inhibition of NMDA receptor currents in PFC pyramidal neurons, providing one molecular substrate for the complex interactions between prefrontal serotonergic and NMDA receptors that underlie cognitive and emotional control by these systems (Yuen et al., 2008). Transactivation of growth factor receptors has also been involved in 5-HT2A receptor-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Quinn et al., 2002; Tsuchioka et al., 2008). In rat C6 glioma cells, it depends on FGFR2 receptor transactivation and leads to the release of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Figure 4B) (Tsuchioka et al., 2008). In smooth muscle cells, 5-HT2A receptor-mediated ERK1/2 activation is PLC/PKC-dependent and  - 19 -  ultimately results in MMP-13 production. This activation could be crucial for the collagen removal required post-partum to restore uterus reproductive function (Shum et al., 2002).  5-HT2A receptors engage the Janus Kinase-2 (JAK)2/Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3 pathway in various cell types (Figure 4B). In trophoblast choricarcinoma cells, 5-HT2A receptor stimulation activates both JAK2/STAT3 and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathways, which results in an increased DNA synthesis and improved viability of the cells (Oufkir et al., 2010; Oufkir & Vaillancourt, 2011). Activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway has also been demonstrated in rat frontal cortex, where it leads to the extinction of receptor-stimulated PLC activation (Singh et al., 2010).  Finally, 5-HT2A (and 5-HT2C) receptor stimulation by DOI induces transglutaminase (TGase)-catalyzed transamidation and activation of the small G proteins Rac1 and Cdc42 in primary cultured cortical neurons (Figure 4B), a process that causes a transient dendritic spine enlargement (Mi et al., 2017). 5-HT2B receptor The 5-HT2B receptor is also coupled to the Gq/11 proteins and activates PLC. 5-HT2B receptor stimulation in mouse fibroblasts induces ERK1/2 activation through transactivation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor to promote cyclin D1 expression. Moreover, 5-HT2B receptor stimulation increases activity of the Src family kinases, c-Src, Fyn, and c-Yes but only Src contributes to Cyclin D1 expression and cell cycle control by the receptor (Nebigil et al., 2000). In astroglial cells, activation of the receptor induced by fluoxetine treatment triggers ERK1/2 phosphorylation that depends on EGF receptor transactivation (Li et al., 2008). Furthermore, 5-HT2B receptors are coupled to PLA2 (Tournois et al., 1998) and can activate both constitutive and inducible NOS (Manivet et al., 2000; Tournois et al., 1998). 5-HT2C receptor Both non-edited and edited forms of the 5-HT2C receptor are coupled to Gq/11 proteins  and activate PLC (Figure 4), but the editing results in decreased constitutive activity of the receptor and reduced agonist affinity and potency (Herrick-Davis et al., 1999; Niswender et al., 1999).  - 20 -  5-HT2C receptor stimulation also induces PLD activation via coupling to Ga13 protein, and the transactivation of the small G-protein RhoA (Figure 4C) (McGrew et al., 2004). Notably, the fully edited (5HT2C-VGV) receptor does not activate the PLD pathway (McGrew et al., 2004), further supporting that editing represent a key regulatory mechanism of 5-HT2C receptor-operated signaling. Agonist-dependent and independent 5-HT2C receptor activation also leads to ERK1/2 phosphorylation through a G-independent, b-arrestin-dependent mechanism, which requires the receptor to be bound to CaM (Figure 4C) (Labasque et al., 2010; Labasque et al., 2008). Recent studies revealed that the b-arrestin-dependent stimulation of ERK1/2 pathway by the 5-HT2C receptor, as well as other GPCRs that engage ERK signaling through a b-arrestin-dependent mechanism, requires b-arrestin2 phosphorylation on Thr383 (Cassier et al., 2017). Finally, stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors induces the transamidation of the small G proteins Rac1 and Cdc42 in primary cortical cultures (Mi et al., 2017). 5-HT3 receptors As cationic channels permeable to Na+, K+ and Ca2+, 5-HT3 receptors give rise to fast, depolarizing responses and Ca2+ increase through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels in neurons upon activation (Maricq et al., 1991). Postsynaptic receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission while presynaptic receptors promote the release of 5-HT or other neurotransmitters in various brain regions. 5-HT4 receptor Stimulation of native 5-HT4 receptors activates the Gs/cAMP/PKA pathway in colliculi neurons, guinea-pig hippocampus and nucleus accumbens (Figure 4D) (Bockaert et al., 1990; Dumuis et al., 1988; Dumuis et al., 1989). Coupling to other G proteins such as Gq and Gi/o have also been described in heterologous systems (Bockaert et al., 2006; Ponimaskin et al., 2002). 5-HT4 receptors are also coupled to Ga13 (Figure 4D), an effect that leads to a RhoA-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding in NIE-115 cells (Ponimaskin et al., 2002). Further supporting a prominent role of 5-HT4 receptors in the regulation of neuronal architecture, receptor coupling to Ga13 in cultured hippocampal neurons results in the reduction of neurite length and of the total number of neurites (Kvachnina et al., 2005). Notably, splice  - 21 -  variants of the receptor not only exhibit variable levels of constitutive activity (Claeysen et al., 1999) but can also display specificity towards the G protein with which they are coupled. For example, the 5-HT4(b) receptor activates both Gs and Gi/o proteins, whereas the 5-HT4(a) receptor is only coupled to Gs (Pindon et al., 2002). The 5-HT4 receptor also engages the ERK1/2 pathway through a b-arrestin-independent mechanism that requires Src activation (Figure 4D) (Barthet et al., 2009), consistent with the inability of the receptor to promote b-arrestin2 phosphorylation at Thr383 (Cassier et al., 2017). Activation of 5-HT4 receptors also induces activation of the exchange factor Epac (Figure 4D), which in turn stimulates Rac and a-secretase-mediated amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. This results in the release of the neuroprotective extracellular APP fragment sAPPa from both CHO cells and primary cultured cortical neurons (Maillet et al., 2003). More recently, an interaction between the 5-HT4 receptor and the a-secretase ADAM10 has been described (Cochet et al., 2013). This interaction results in an increase in sAPPa release through the PKA/Epac signaling pathway (Cochet et al., 2013). 5-HT5A receptor  Amongst the two 5-HT5 receptor variants identified, only the 5-HT5A variant is functional in humans (Grailhe et al., 2001). The 5-HT5A receptor is coupled to Gi/o proteins and inhibits cAMP production in recombinant cells, but little is known about the coupling of native receptors (Noda et al., 2003). In the cerebral cortex of rodents, 5-HT5 receptor stimulation induces an inward rectifying outward current that is suppressed by blockers of Kir3 channels (Goodfellow et al., 2012). The 5-HT5 receptor has been involved in pain (Munoz-Islas et al., 2014), cognitive deficits in a rat model of schizophrenia (Avila-Rojas et al., 2015; Nikiforuk et al., 2016) and in the acoustic startle circuits (Curtin et al., 2013). 5-HT6 receptor As firstly established in mouse striatal neurons in primary culture (Sebben et al., 1994), the 5-HT6 receptor is canonically coupled to Gs protein and activates adenylyl cyclase (Figure 4E) (Sebben et al., 1994). In striatal neurons, 5-HT6 receptor-operated cAMP signaling can regulate DARPP32 enzymatic activity (Svenningsson et al., 2002). The 5-HT6 receptor binds to and  - 22 -  activates the tyrosine kinase Fyn, a process that leads to ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 4E) (Yun et al., 2007). 5-HT6 receptor activation also induces the translocation of Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (Jab1) into the nucleus, leading to an increase in c-Jun phosphorylation and the interaction between Jab1 and c-Jun (Yun et al., 2010). The 5-HT6 receptor can also activate the mTOR pathway in various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex (Figure 4E). mTOR activation under the control of 5-HT6 receptors, has been involved in both cognitive deficits observed in rodent developmental models of schizophrenia (Meffre et al., 2012) and seizure activity in epilepsy (L. Wang et al., 2015). Finally, 5-HT6 receptors activate Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)5 in an agonist-independent manner through a mechanism involving a reciprocal interplay between the receptor and Cdk5 whereby phosphorylation of receptor Ser350 by associated Cdk5 is required for 5-HT6 receptor-operated Cdk5 activation (Figure 4E). Cdk5 in turn activates a Cdc42 pathway, leading to neuronal differentiation and the initiation of neurite growth (Duhr et al., 2014). 5-HT6 receptor-elicited Cdk5 signaling has also been involved in the fine-tuning of neuronal migration by the receptor (Jacobshagen et al., 2014). 5-HT7 receptor 5-HT7 receptors are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase via Gas and induce cAMP production (Figure 4F) (Bard et al., 1993; Lovenberg et al., 1993; Ruat, Traiffort, Leurs, et al., 1993). They are also coupled to Ga12 (Kvachnina et al., 2005) in NIH/3T3 cells and hippocampal neurons, where their stimulation leads to the activation of RhoA and Cdc42, and triggers neurite growth (Kvachnina et al., 2005). Both agonist-dependent and independent activation of 5-HT7 receptors induce formation of dendritic spines and synaptogenesis in cortical and striatal neurons through the activation of Cdk5 and Cdc42 (Figure 4F) (Speranza et al., 2017). Likewise, activation of 5-HT7/G12 signaling potentiates formation of dendritic spines and enhances synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons at early post-natal stages. In a recent study, Bijata et al. demonstrated that the effects of the 5-HT7 receptor upon dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity depend on local activation of MMP-9 that in turn cleaves CD44 bound to the receptor, leading to Cdc42 activation (Bijata et al., 2017). In  - 23 -  hippocampal neurons, the 5-HT7 receptor also activates ERK1/2 (Errico et al., 2001), but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. It may involve PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Ras-GRF1 and subsequent Ras activation (Norum et al., 2003; Norum et al., 2005). VI- Homo and heterodimerization of 5-HT receptors and their consequences on 5-HT receptor signaling and functions Accumulating evidence indicates that GPCRs are not only monomeric entities that couple to G proteins upon activation by a single ligand molecule, but that they form dimers or even higher order oligomers composed of unique or different receptor proteins, which exhibit specific pharmacological and signaling properties underlying unique physiological outcomes. It is thus not surprising that the ability to form dimers, and in some cases oligomers, has now been shown for many 5-HT receptors, including 5-HT1A (Kobe et al., 2008), 5-HT2A (Brea et al., 2009; Teitler & Klein, 2012), 5-HT2C (Herrick-Davis et al., 2015), 5-HT4 (Pellissier et al., 2011), and 5-HT7 (Teitler & Klein, 2012) receptors. Different factors regulate 5-HT receptor oligomerization. These include receptor density, with low expression levels favoring monomeric forms while higher expression levels favor association of dimers into tetramers, cholesterol level in the membrane and ligand binding. For instance, if 5-HT1A receptors have the propensity to form homodimers in absence of ligand, agonists (8-OH-DPAT) enhance while antagonists (SCH58216 and methysergide) decrease dimer formation (Lukasiewicz et al., 2007). Homodimer formation not only leads to new pharmacological entities with specific binding and signal transduction properties but it might also be important for receptor trafficking to the membrane when it occurs early during receptor synthesis, as shown for the 5-HT2C receptor (Herrick-Davis et al., 2006). Certain 5-HT receptors are not only capable of forming homodimers, or homo-oligomers, but can also form heteromers with different 5-HT receptor subtypes (Table 1). Due to technical difficulties, their ability to form heteromers has mostly been demonstrated in vitro using cell lines and in most cases remains to be established in vivo. However, evidence of the presence of heteromers composed of different 5-HT receptor subtypes in vivo is emerging. For instance, 5- - 24 -  HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors were found to form a complex that might be involved in the control of impulsivity in the rat mPFC (Anastasio et al., 2015), and the ability of both receptors to heteromerize was recently confirmed by three complementary biophysical techniques (Felsing et al., 2018). 5-HT2B receptors also form heteromers with 5-HT2C receptors. Heteromerization with 5-HT2C receptors blunts both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor-operated signaling in transfected cells and neurons, suggesting that 5-HT2 receptors form functionally asymmetric heterodimers in vitro and in vivo (Moutkine et al., 2017). Co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that the 5-HT1A receptor forms hetero-oligomers with several 5-HT receptor subtypes, but only heteromers with 5-HT2A or 5-HT7 receptors have been validated. The existence of 5-HT1A:5-HT2A receptor heteromers has been demonstrated in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1-CA3 regions of the dorsal hippocampus using in situ proximity ligation assay and was further validated in cellular models by BRET (Borroto-Escuela et al., 2017). The number of 5-HT1A:5-HT2A clusters in CA1 and CA2 regions decreases 24 h after a forced swim test session, suggesting that 5-HT1A:5-HT2A heteromerization is a dynamic process that might be involved in depression-like behavior (Borroto-Escuela et al., 2017). 5-HT1A:5-HT7 receptor heteromerization inhibits 5-HT1A receptor-mediated activation of Gi without affecting 5-HT7 receptor-operated signaling, and decreases the ability of the 5-HT1A receptor to activate GIRK channels in hippocampal neurons (Renner et al., 2012). Moreover, 5-HT1A:5-HT7 heteromerization promotes 5-HT-induced 5-HT1A receptor internalization and receptor-operated ERK1,2 activation.  Accumulated evidence also indicates that 5-HT receptors can form heteromers with GPCRs not activated by 5-HT, with important consequences on their signaling and functional outcomes (Table 1). 5-HT1A receptors heteromerize with galanin receptor 1 (GalR1) (Borroto-Escuela, Narvaez, et al., 2010), the zinc receptor GPR39 (Tena-Campos et al., 2015), D2 dopaminergic receptor (Lukasiewicz et al., 2016) and µ-opioid receptor (MOR) (Cussac et al., 2012). GalR1-5-HT1A receptor heteromerization induces a reciprocal inhibition of signaling engaged by both receptors via allosteric mechanisms (Borroto-Escuela, Narvaez, et al., 2010). Intriguingly, GalR1-5-HT1A receptor heteromers can further associate with GPR39 to form heterotrimers and  - 25 -  the presence of GalR1 seems to inhibit both 5-HT1A and GPR39-operated signaling (Tena-Campos et al., 2015). Likewise, 5-H1A:D2 heteromer formation seems to profoundly affect signal transduction properties of both receptors and the response to antipsychotics (Lukasiewicz et al., 2016). Though the existence 5-HT1A:D2 heteromers has been established in mouse prefrontal cortex (Kolasa et al., 2018), the irrefutable proof that the observed effects of heteromerization on signal transduction of both receptors result from heteromer formation and not solely receptor co-expression is still lacking. The existence of MOR:5-HT1A heteromers in vivo also remains to be established. Data obtained in cell lines suggest a crosstalk within MOR:5-HT1A heteromers to activate Gao and ERK1/12 pathways (Cussac et al., 2012). The 5-HT2A receptor forms heteromers with a number of GPCRs, including mGlu2 (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2008), cannabinoid CB1 (Vinals et al., 2015), D2 (Borroto-Escuela, Romero-Fernandez, et al., 2010) and cortiocotropin releasing factor (CRF)1 receptors (Narla et al., 2015), the latter involving PDZ-based interactions. Evidence of their existence in vivo has only been established for 5-HT2A:mGlu2 (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2008) and 5-HT2A:CB1 heteromers (Vinals et al., 2015). 5-HT2A:mGlu2 heteromerization strongly influences signal transduction elicited by both receptors by modulating their coupling to G proteins and phosphorylation profile (Fribourg et al., 2011; Murat et al., 2018). Numerous data also suggest that 5-HT2A:mGlu2 heteromers represent the actual receptor entity that underlies the psychomimetic effects of hallucinogens as well as the action of second and last-generation antipsychotics that acts at 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors, respectively  (Benvenga et al., 2018; Delille et al., 2013; Fribourg et al., 2011; Moreno et al., 2011). 5-HT2A:CB1 heteromer formation switches G protein coupling of 5-HT2A receptor from Gq to Gi (Vinals et al., 2015). 5-HT2A:CB1 heteromers also mediate Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-induced memory impairment but not its analgesic effects, suggesting that they might be relevant targets to dissociate the beneficial antinociceptive properties of THC from its side effects upon cognition (Vinals et al., 2015). Functional crosstalk within 5-HT2A-D2 and 5-HT2A/CRF1 receptor heteromers has also been suggested (Borroto-Escuela, Romero-Fernandez, et al., 2010; Narla et al., 2015). The 5-HT2C receptor forms functional heteromers with MT2 melatonin receptors in human  - 26 -  cortex and hippocampus that may be of special interest as target for the treatment of mood disorders in light of the “synergistic” melatonin agonist/5-HT2C antagonist profile of the antidepressant agomelatine (Kamal et al., 2015). The 5-HT2C receptor also forms complexes with another receptor involved in the control of food intake, the ghrelin GHS-R1a receptor (Schellekens et al., 2015). Blocking 5-HT2C receptor signaling potentiates ghrelin orexigenic effect, whereas lorcaserin, a 5-HT2C receptor agonist approved for the treatment of obesity, attenuates ghrelin-induced food intake (Schellekens et al., 2015). The role of heteromerization in these effects remains to be established.  VII- 5-HT receptor-interacting proteins and their role in 5-HT receptor-operated signal transduction and functions Over the past 20 years, it has become evident that GPCRs, including G protein-coupled 5-HT receptors, are not solely capable of interacting with other GPCRs, G proteins and b-arrestins, but that they additionally recruit specific proteins called GIPs (GPCR-interacting proteins) that strongly influence GPCR intracellular fate and signal transduction properties (Bockaert et al., 2004). Some 5-HT receptors are certainly amongst the GPCRs for which the largest number of interacting proteins has been characterized, mostly thanks to two-hybrid screens or affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) proteomic strategies (Marin et al., 2012). However, the characterization of 5-HT receptor interactomes differs from one receptor to another and still remains to be done for several 5-HT receptors  (Table 2). 5-HT1A receptor CaM was the first interacting partner of the 5-HT1A receptor identified. CaM is recruited via two binding motifs located in the receptor i3 loop and thereby interferes with receptor phosphorylation by PKC and desensitization (Turner et al., 2004). The 5-HT1A receptor also binds to Yif1B, the orthologue of the yeast Yif1p implicated in vesicular trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, via its C-terminal domain (Carrel et al., 2008). Yif1B functions as a scaffold protein that recruits a complex composed of Yip1A, Rab6, Kif5B and dynein, involved in dendritic targeting of the receptor (Al Awabdh et al., 2012).  - 27 -  5-HT1B receptor The 5-HT1B receptor interacts with the adaptor protein p11, also designated as S100A10, which has been involved in depression-like behaviors and responses to antidepressants as well as to cocaine in rodents. P11 increases localization of 5-HT1B receptors at the cell surface and data suggest that 5-HT1B receptor:p11 interaction may play a role in response to antidepressants (Svenningsson et al., 2006). Further studies suggested a role of this interaction in L-DOPA treatment of Parkinson’s disease (Zhang et al., 2008) and the regulation of emotional memory by 5-HT1B receptors (Eriksson et al., 2013). 5-HT2A receptor The 5-HT2A receptor recruits several PDZ domain-containing proteins (PDZ proteins) through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (-SCV). These include the major postsynaptic protein PSD-95 and other proteins of the postsynaptic density (Becamel et al., 2004), which profoundly influence receptor trafficking and signaling. 5-HT2A receptor:PSD95 interaction modulates receptor targeting (Xia, Hufeisen, et al., 2003), trafficking (Xia, Gray, et al., 2003), psychomimetic effects of hallucinogens and responses to antipsychotics acting on 5-HT2A receptors (Abbas et al., 2009) as well as neuropathic pain (Pichon et al., 2010; Vogrig et al., 2013). The 5-HT2A receptor also binds to PDZK1/NHERF3 but, surprisingly, through a PDZ-independent mechanism. 5-HT2A receptor/PDZK1 association negatively regulates 5-HT2A receptor endocytosis and, correspondingly, promote receptor-operated PLC activation (Walther et al., 2015). Likewise, 5-HT2A receptor association with SAP97 decreases receptor internalization rate and enhance receptor-induced inositol phosphate production (Dunn et al., 2014). More recently, using a PDZ overlay assay, Hammad et al. showed that 5-HT2A receptors physically interact with the three members of the MAGI PDZ protein family (MAGI-1, MAGI-2 and MAGI-3) (Hammad et al., 2018). All three proteins share a similar structure containing one guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain, two tryptophan (WW) domains and six PDZ domains. MAGI proteins promote 5-HT2A receptor internalization and differentially modulate receptor-induced signaling pathways: their association with the receptor enhances the recruitment of  - 28 -  PLCβ3 to the receptor and PLC signaling, whereas it inhibits ERK1/2 activation, the latter effect being PDZ-independent (Hammad et al., 2018).  The 5-HT2A receptor also recruits a number of non-PDZ proteins that influence their signal transduction and functions. As shown for 5-HT1A receptors, 5-HT2A receptors bind to CaM, which influences receptor phosphorylation and desensitization (Turner & Raymond, 2005). They also associate with p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK)2, a downstream kinase of the ERK1,2 pathway that phosphorylates a serine residue located in the receptor i3 loop (Sheffler et al., 2006). Notably, RSK2 expresses a C-terminal PDZ binding motif and RSK2/PDZ protein interactions have been demonstrated to be important for the role of RSK2 in regulation of synaptic transmission (G. M. Thomas et al., 2005). 5-HT2A receptors associate with caveolin-1 in various cell types (Bhatnagar et al., 2004). Both form a complex with KV1.5 channels upon receptor stimulation by 5-HT (Cogolludo et al., 2006). Finally, 5-HT2A receptors associate with PLD1 (Felder et al., 1990) and the ADP-ribosylation factors ARF1 and, to a lesser extent, ARF6 (Robertson et al., 2003). Physical interaction between PLD1 and ARF proteins seems to be essential for 5-HT2A receptor-operated PLD activation. 5-HT2B receptor The 5-HT2B receptor interactome remains much less characterized, when compared to the 5-HT2A receptor one. The presence of a PDZ binding motif at its C-terminus suggests its interaction with PDZ proteins. As 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, the 5-HT2B receptor recruits the multi-PDZ protein 1 (MUPP1) (Becamel et al., 2001), but the role of this interaction remains to be elucidated. It has been shown that the activation of NOS by the 5-HT2B receptor is PDZ-dependent (Manivet et al., 2000), but the nature of the PDZ protein(s) involved also remains to be established. 5-HT2C receptor In line with the presence of PDZ binding motif at its C-terminal extremity, the 5-HT2C recruits a number of PDZ proteins through PDZ-based interactions. MUPP1 was the first receptor PDZ binding partner identified (Ullmer et al., 1998). Further studies showed that 5-HT2C  - 29 -  receptor:MUPP1 interaction is dynamically regulated by agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation at a serine residue located in the PDZ binding motif (Ser458) (Parker et al., 2003). Association of the 5-HT2 like Caenorhabditis elegans receptor SER-1 with a multi-PDZ domain containing protein similar to MUPP1 is involved in 5-HT-stimulated egg laying in the worm (Xiao et al., 2006), suggesting that this interaction play a key in some receptor functions. The receptor also binds to additional PDZ proteins, such as PSD-95 and MPP3, which differentially regulate receptor trafficking (Becamel et al., 2002; Gavarini et al., 2006). As previously mentioned, interaction of CaM with the juxta-membrane region of the receptor C-terminus is critical for the G-independent, b-arrestin-dependent, activation of ERK1/2 by the receptor (Labasque et al., 2008). The interaction of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) with the receptor i3 loop leads to inhibition of agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation. Disruption of 5-HT2C receptor/PTEN interaction prevents the increase in firing rate of ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons induced by THC, thus mimicking the effect of agonist receptor stimulation (Ji et al., 2006). More recently, Kleene et al. showed an interaction between the receptor i3 loop and the cell adhesion molecule close homolog of L1 (CHL1) and that CHL1 regulates receptor association with b-arrestin and PTEN and signaling pathways engaged by constitutively active 5-HT2C receptors (Kleene et al., 2015). Finally, 5-HT2C receptors expressed in hypothalamus interact with Abelson helper integration site 1 (Ahi1) protein. This interaction promotes 5-HT2C receptor degradation in the lysosomal pathway and thereby contributes to its control of food intake (H. Wang et al., 2012). 5-HT4 receptor Consistent with the presence of a PDZ binding motif at the C-terminus of some 5-HT4 receptor variants (e.g. SCF and VPV in 5-HT4a and 5-HT4e variants, respectively), these variants recruit specific sets of PDZ proteins (Joubert et al., 2004). For instance, the 5-HT4a receptor interacts with sortin nexin (SNX)27 and NEHRF1 (EBP50), that target the receptor to microvilli where it is co-localized with activated ezrin, and early endosomes, respectively (Joubert et al., 2004). Further studies identified SNX27 as an essential adaptor protein linking GPCRs to the retromer and contributing to their endosome-to-plasma membrane traffic (Temkin et al., 2011). The  - 30 -  function of other 5-HT4 receptor-PDZ protein interactions identified remains to be elucidated. The 5-HT4 receptor directly interacts with Src and its activation promotes auto-phosphorylation of Src bound to the receptor at Tyr416. Src association with the receptor and its subsequent phosphorylation are required for the engagement of ERK1/2 signaling by the 5-HT4 receptor (Barthet et al., 2009). Reminiscent of the 5-HT1B receptor, the 5-HT4 receptor interacts with p11 (Warner-Schmidt et al., 2009). P11 increases 5-HT4 receptor surface expression, thereby enhancing receptor-operated signaling, and is required for the behavioral antidepressant response induced by 5-HT4 receptor stimulation (Warner-Schmidt et al., 2009). Likewise, induction of p11 expression by BDNF or imipramine in cardiomyocytes reveals 5-HT4 receptor-mediated effects on Ca2+ handling (Meschin et al., 2015). The 5-HT4 receptor also physically associates with the a-secretase ADAM10 and Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) to promote its non-amyloidogenic cleavage and the release of the neuroprotective soluble APP fragment sAPPa in an agonist-independent manner (Cochet et al., 2013). More recently, a systematic screen of protein-protein interactions implicating clinically relevant GPCRs identified G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 2 (GPRIN2) (Sokolina et al., 2017), a protein known to interact with G proteins (Chen et al., 1999) and the Parkinson's disease-associated receptor GPR37 (Dusonchet et al., 2009), as novel 5-HT4d receptor interacting partners (Sokolina et al., 2017). Co-expression of GPR37 and GPRIN2 with the 5-HT4d receptor potentiates receptor-elicited cAMP production while it prevents ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK-293 cells (Sokolina et al., 2017). 5-HT6 receptor The Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn was the first 5-HT6 receptor interacting protein identified by means of a two-hybrid screen using the receptor C-terminal domain as bait (Yun et al., 2007). Further studies showed that 5-HT6 receptor:Fyn interaction promotes receptor cell surface expression and its coupling to G proteins and, reciprocally, that 5-HT6 receptor activation increases Fyn kinase activity (Yun et al., 2007). Furthermore, activation of ERK1/2 signaling depends on Fyn (Yun et al., 2007). The same group of investigators identified two additional 5-HT6 receptor partners, namely, Jun activation domain-binding protein1 (Jab1) (Yun et al.,  - 31 -  2010) and the microtubule-associated protein Map1b (Kim et al., 2014). 5-HT6 receptor stimulation promotes Jab1 translocation to the nucleus, its association with c-Jun, and c-Jun phosphorylation (Yun et al., 2010). Both Jab1 and Map1b increase 5-HT6 receptor cell surface expression and consequently receptor-mediated signal transduction (Kim et al., 2014; Yun et al., 2010).  An AP-MS proteomic strategy revealed that 5-HT6 receptors recruit several proteins of the mTOR pathway (Meffre et al., 2012). These include mTOR itself and raptor, which, together with mTOR, constitutes the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), Tti1 and Tel2, which form a complex required for the assembly and stability of mTORC1, neurofibromin1 (NF1), a Ras GTPase activating protein identified as an upstream modulator of the mTOR pathway (Johannessen et al., 2005) and Vps34, a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) necessary for mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids and implicated in autophagosome formation (Backer, 2008). Physical interaction between the 5-HT6 receptor and mTOR seems to be essential for receptor-operated mTOR activation, which has been involved in cognitive deficits observed in neurodevelopmental models of schizophrenia (Meffre et al., 2012) as well as seizure activity of epileptic brain (L. Wang et al., 2015) in rodents. A more recent study revealed that 5-HT6 receptor-neurofibromin interaction is critical for agonist-independent receptor-operated cAMP signaling in prefrontal cortex (Deraredj Nadim et al., 2016). Another study showed that the 5-HT6 receptor directly interacts with SNX14 and that this interaction promotes receptor internalization and degradation (Ha et al., 2015). Finally, the 5-HT6 receptor was found to associate with a network of proteins, including Cdk5 and some of its regulator or substrates. These proteins are known to control actin cytoskeleton dynamics and key neurodevelopmental processes such as neuronal migration, neurite growth, and synapse morphogenesis (Duhr et al., 2014; Jacobshagen et al., 2014; Jessberger et al., 2009). As mentioned in chapter V, functional studies showed that agonist-independent activation of Cdk5 signaling by 5-HT6 receptors plays a key role in its control of neuronal migration and differentiation during brain development (Duhr et al., 2014; Jacobshagen et al., 2014). 5-HT7 receptor  - 32 -  Using a yeast two-hybrid screening, Matthys et al. showed that the C-terminal domain of the 5-HT7a receptor directly interacts with RhoBTB3, an atypical Rho GTPase, which strongly inhibits proteasomal degradation of the receptor (Matthys et al., 2012). 5-HT7 receptors also bind to S100B, a Ca2+-binding protein that serves as a biochemical predictor of behavioral responses to chronic ﬂuoxetine treatment, via its i3 loop (Stroth & Svenningsson, 2015). This interaction negatively regulates 5-HT7 receptor-dependent cAMP production in transfected HeLa cells and mouse cortical astrocytes. It might also play a role in mood disorders as depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST) observed in transgenic mice over-expressing S100B is normalized by pharmacological 5-HT7 receptor blockade (Stroth & Svenningsson, 2015). Finally, a recent study highlighted a physical interaction between the 5-HT7 receptor and CD44, an MMP-9 substrate cleaved upon receptor activation in neurons and involved in receptor-mediated dendritic spine remodeling, synaptic pruning and impairment of LTP (Bijata et al., 2017).   Concluding remarks Over the two last decades, our knowledge of G protein-dependent signaling mechanisms engaged by 5-HT receptors has probably achieved maturity. An important challenge is now to precisely determine where 5-HT receptors activate G proteins in the cells and the dynamics of G protein activation. Recently described single-molecule microscopy methods that allow direct visualization of GPCR:G protein interactions in living cells with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, will certainly provide a unique opportunity to address this question (Calebiro & Sungkaworn, 2018). Beyond G protein signaling, identification of 5-HT receptor interactomes using genetics or proteomics strategies has proven efficiency to identify novel signaling pathways engaged by these receptors, as recently exemplified by the identification of novel 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor-operated signaling pathways that underlie their role in neural development. Determination of crystal structures of 5-HT receptors will also be an important step in the understanding of 5-HT receptor activation process and of the mechanism of action  - 33 -  of 5-HT receptor ligands, as well as in the development of drugs acting at 5-HT receptors. Given the importance of heteromer formation and the association of 5-HT receptors with GIPs in their signal transduction properties and functions, the next step will certainly be to determine structures of complexes made of 5-HT receptors and their protein partners.

Classification of serotonin receptors: an historic view The evolution of 5-HT receptor classification from the first proposal made by Gaddum and Picarelli to the current consensus is depicted. During the “Pharmacological Period”, 8 receptor subtypes have been characterized. During the “Molecular Biology Period”, 17 genes (designated as HTRs) and one pseudogene (designated as Htr) have been cloned, leading to the current classification of 17 functional 5-HT receptors. Figure 2. Solved structures of 5-HT receptors Comparison of the overall architecture of 5-HT1B (A), 5-HT2B (B) and 5-HT2C receptors (C and D) bound to the agonist ergotamine (ERG) or the inverse agonist ritanserin (RIT). The limits of the classical orthosteric site are indicated using dashed lines: upper limit in blue, lower limit in pink. Figure 3. Gene structures of human 5-HT receptor coding sequences This figure was generated using released data of the human genome project available on the NCBI site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using Gene Database and Consensus CDS Reference Sequences. GRCh38.p12 assembly was used to localize the exons except for Htr5B that was annotated using GRCm38.p4 assembly. First column: gene names and chromosomic localizations. Second column: exon composition of the coding sequences and part of the receptor encoded by each exon (open boxes, exons; bridges, splicing events; black boxes, trans-membrane domains; curved lines, loops or N- or C-terminal domains; colours, alternative exons). Third column: name and size of the gene products and splice variants (aa, amino acids). Fourth column: size of the complete coding sequence on the human genome (b, bases; kb, kilo bases). Figure 4.
