  
Abstract —In the  pr
esent study an attempt was made to 
examine the potential of different bacterial strains for 
decolorization of Acid Orange 10,  (azo dye) in batch reactors. 
The effect of media condition, pH, temperature and initial concentration of dye was studied with an aim to determine the 
optimal conditions required for maximum decolorization and 
degradation. The bacterial strains used in the study were 
Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus cere us, Pseudomonas fluorescens, 
Bacillus subtilis, Alcaligens sp. and Staphylococcus aureus.  Out 
of these Pseudomonas putida emerged out to be most potent 
decolorizer, being selected for further studies. The selected 
bacterium shows higher decolorization in static condition as 
compared to shaking condi tion. The optimum pH for 
decolorization of Acid Orange 10 by Pseudomonas putida  was 
7.0. It shows good decolorization efficiency even in alkaline 
region. The optimum temperature was 37 
0C. Th e 
strain could 
decolorize Acid Orange 10 (250 mg/l) by 90% within 24 h under the optimum conditions of static condition, pH 7.0, 
temperature of 37 
0C and initia l d
ye concentration of 250 mg/l. 
The result shows that the selected culture has good potential in 
removal of Azo dyes from wast e water under static conditions.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Differe nt d
yes used in textile industry usually have a 
synthetic origin and complex aromatic molecular structures 
which make them more stable and more difficult to be biodegraded. Due to th eir ease of manufacturing 
methodology, azo dye accounts for almost 80% of annual production of commercial dyes all over the world. There are 
over 10,0000 commercially available dyes with a production of over 7×10
5 tons  pe
r year [1]. Azo dyes, containing one or 
more azo bond (-N=N-), account for 60-70% of all textile dyestuffs used [2]. It is estimated that about 10-15% of the 
total production of colorants is lost during their synthesis 
and dyeing Processes [3, 4]. Whereas, in the case of reactive dyes almost 50% of the initial dye load is found in the dye bath effluents. Colored industrial effluent is the most 
obvious indicator of water pollution and the discharge of 
highly colored synthetic dye effluents is aesthetically displeasing and cause considerable damage to the aquatic life. Although several physical-chemical methods have been used to eliminate the colored effluents in wastewater, they 
are generally expensive, produce large amounts of sludge. 
More often these conventional modes of treatment lead to the formation of some harmful side products. Interest is

ore now focused on the microbial biodegradation of 
dyes as a better alternative [5]. Some microorganisms, 
including bacteria, fungi and al gae, can degrade or absorb a 
wide range of dyes [6] .The biological mode of treatment of 
dye bath effluents offers distinct advantages over the 
conventional modes of treatment. This method is more 
economical and leads to less accumulation of relatively harmless sludge. Most importantly, biological treatment of dye bath effluents is ecofriendly. It causes mineralization of 
dyes to simpler inorganic compounds which are not lethal to 
life forms. The basic step in the decolorization and 
degradation of azo dyes is breakdown of azo bonds, leading to removal of color. Azo dyes are known to undergo 
reductive cleavage whereas the resultant aromatic amines 
are metabolized under aerobic conditions [7]. So for complete mineralization of azo dyes the microbial population forming part of treatment system should be able to work efficiently under both anaerobic and aerobic 
conditions. In view of these problems the most potent bacterial culture was selected in this study for maximum decolorization of Acid Orange 10 (azo dye), being selected as model azo dye.

The bacterial strain giving maximum decolorization 
values was selected and used for further decolorization 
experiments. Changes in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) 
and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) were also studied using Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater APHA, 1995. 
D. Conical flask assay 
Conical flask assay was performed for the detection of 
decolorizing activity of bact eria. The nutrient broth 
containing Acid Orange 10 was autoclaved at 121 
0C for  15 
m
inutes. 5 % inoculums of the selected culture showing 
maximum decolorizing activity was  added to nutrient broth 
flasks containing Acid Orange 10 (250 mg l-1). Th e 
flasks 
were covered with Aluminum fo ils and were incubated at 32 
0C for 3  day
s. The flasks were observed for decolorization 
of the azo dye present in the medium (Fig.2).  
E. Optimization of parameters 
In an attempt to study the effect of static and shaking 
(140 rpm) condition, the select ed, most potent decolorizing 
bacterial culture, was cultivated for 24 h in nutrient broth 
and amended separately with 250 mg/l of Acid Orange 10. 
To determine the effect of pH  on decolorization, the fully 
grown culture was inoculated in conical flasks containing 100 ml nutrient broth of varying pH (4-10) and was 
amended with 250 mg/l of Acid Orange 10. The pH values 
were adjusted using 1N NaOH and 1N HCl. In the similar fashion, the optimum temperat ure of dye decolorization by 
selected bacterium was determ ined by evaluating the dye 
decolorization at 20, 30, 37, 40 and 50 
0C. After d i
fferent 
time intervals, aliquot (5ml) of the culture media was withdrawn and supernatants ob tained after centrifugation 
was used for analysis of decolorization by Shimadzu double beam spectrophotometer ( UV 1601), according to the 
methods explained earlier. 
F. Concentration studies 
The selected culture was cultivated for 24 h in conical 
flask containing 100 ml nutrient broth. After 24 h the media 
was amended with the dye Acid Orange 10 at a concentration of 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 mg/ l 
separately to study the effect of increasing dye 
concentration on percentage dye decolorization.  
G. Biodecolorization and biodegradation analysis  
The analysis was done using UV-VIS spectrometry, TLC 
and FTIR. The supernatants obtained after decolorization were extracted with dich loromethane and dried over 
anhydrous Na
2So4 and ev aporated to 
dryness. The residue 
obtained was first examined by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). It is further subjected to FTIR spectroscopy. Infrared spectra were determined on Thermo FT-IR spectrophotometer (Nicolet -1700).

ESULTS AND  DISCUSSION  
A. Evalu a
tion of optimum conditions 
 The dye decolorization of azo dye Acid Orange 10 was 
studied under static condition with an initial dye concentration of 250 mg/l usi ng different bacterial cultures 
of Pseudomonas putida MTCC 102,  Bacillus cereus  MTCC 
3105 , Pseudomonas fluorescens MTCC 103, Bacillus 
subtilis  NCIM 2063 , Alcaligens sp. NCIM 2901 and  
Staphylococcus aureus NCIM 2901. Out of these cultures, 
Pseudomonas putida    MTCC 102 was the best decolorizer 
with a percentage decolorization value of 90%, followed by 
Bacillus cereus , Bacillus subtilis  and  Pseudomonas  
fluorescens with an efficiency of 65%, 54% and 39% 
respectively. The remaining two cultures of Alcaligens sp. 
shows 4% and staphylococcus aureus  show 2% 
decolorization (Fig.1). Thus, Pseudomonas putida  MTCC 
102 was selected for further decolorization experiments, with getting aware of its decolorizing potential. It was observed that under static anoxic conditions, the dye 
decolorization of Acid Orange 10 was 90 % within 24 h as 
compared to 32 % under agita tion, respectively (Fig.3a). 
Hence, Static conditions were preferred to investigate bacterial dye decolorization in further experiments. The result bears similarity with those of studies on Pseudomonas  
desmolyticum and Pseudomonas luteola . It was found out 
that under agitation conditions, presence of oxygen deprives the azoreductase from obtaining electrons needed for cleavage of azo dyes .Whereas under static  conditions, 
these electrons are available to azoreductase from NADH to 
decolorize azo dyes [8],[9]. The optimum pH for Pseudomonas putida  MTCC 102 was pH 7.0. However, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  NCIM 102 was also capable of 
decolorizing the dye over a pH range of 7-9 with a good efficiency (Fig.3b). Majority of the azo dye reducing bacterial species reported [10] , [11] and [12] so far were 
able to reduce the dye at pH near 7. The decolorization of 
the dye, Acid Orange 10 were studied with temperature range of 20 to 50 
0C. Th e 
optimum temperature for   
Pseudomonas putida MTCC 102 was 37 0C (Fig .3c)
. 
Considerable decrease in Chemical Oxidation Demand (COD) and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) was also 
observed. The values for Reduction in COD were 85% and 
BOD was 75% respectively (Fig.4).

was studied for 24 h in nutrient me dium containing 250 mg/l dye at 
37 0C, pH 7.0 and under static a noxic conditions, unless specified 
otherw
ise. 
B. Effect of  d
ifferent   concentration of dye on 
decolorization  
Percentage decolorization of Acid Orange 10 by 
Pseudomonas putida MTCC 102 was found to vary with 
initial concentrations (100-1000 mg/l) when studied up to 48 h. The 90 % decolorization of Acid Orange 10 was 
observed within 16, 20 and 36 h for the dye concentration of 100, 250 and 500 mg/l, respectively at optimum conditions 
of pH 7.0, temperature 37 
0C and under static b a
tch study. 
However, for the dye Acid Orange 10 concentration of 750 
mg/l, maximum decolorization of 65% and for dye concentration of 1000 mg/l, only 55 % of decolorization was achieved (Fig 5).This is because of the toxic nature of 
azo dyes. The Percentage decolorization is found to be 
decreasing with increase in dye concentration as evident from fig.5. The dye decolorizing potential of Pseudomonas 
putida  MTCC 102 was quite high and it decolorizes the dye 
with better efficiency even at high concentrations of Acid Orange 10.  Pseudomonas putida  MTCC 102 was able to 
decolorize the dye at a concentration much higher than other bacterial strains [13], [14], and [15]. The Pseudomonas 
putida MTCC 102 could tolerate Acid Orange 10 up to 1 g/l 
which is in contrast to the to xic effect reported for the azo 
dye Acid Orange 10 in concentrations within 0.037-0.051 mM [16]. This observation is of significance for bioremediation since it indicates potential of   Pseudomonas 
putida  MTCC 102 to withstand high concentration of azo 
dye. Due to its high degrading potential, Pseudomonas 
putida  MTCC 102 could be used successfully in treatment 
of textile waste waters as they contain high concentration of 
azo dyes.

C. Identifica
tion of metabolic intermediates  
Inoculation of Pseudomonas putida MTCC 102 to media 
containing azo dyes resulted in the decolorization of the dye,

 spectrum. The UV-VIS spectra corresponding to 
initial and final samples of decolorization experiments as 
shown in Fig.4. The absorbance  analyzed from 300 nm to 
800 nm. The initial dye solution showed high peak at the wavelength of 480 nm. The decolorized sample showed lowering of peak to a minimal absorbance value for dye concentration 250 mg/l, which indicates that the decolorization is due to dye degradation (Fig.6.A). The dye 
degradation by pseudomonas putida MTCC 102 was further 
supported by TLC analysis. The spots observed in the initial 
dye solution was different from the spot observed in the supernatant obtained after decolorization (Fig 6B.).The 
supernatant obtained after dye decolorization was different 
from the original dye which was suggested by different Rf values. This clearly indicates that decolorization was due to 
degradation of dyes into intermediate products. The initial 
step in bacterial degradation of dye is reductive cleavage of 
N=N (azo) bond leading to formation of colorless aromatic 
amines. These amines are furthe r oxidized to simpler forms. 
FT-IR analysis was done to characterize the metabolite produced. The results of FT-IR analysis of the dye Acid 
Orange 10 and sample obtained  after decolorization showed 
various peaks. The FT-IR spectra of Acid Orange 10 control 
dye display peaks at 3535.9, 1634, 1494, 1198.2, 1035.4. The IR spectra of degradation product display peak for –OH 
stretching. The peak characteris tic of azo bond at 1494 of 
Acid Orange 10 was absent in the decolorized sample, 
indicating degradation of Acid Orange 10 to aromatic 
amines as intermediate products which are subjected to 
oxidation giving rise to simpler compounds. During the 
degradation of aromatic amines of Acid Orange 10, formation of aromatic aldehyde as an intermediate was confirmed by the spot test using 2, 4-dinitro phenyl 
hydrazine reagent which indicates  color test due to presence 
of aldehyde.

90%. (B) TLC experiments shows different Rf values of control dye 
solution and decolorized samples. IV. CONCLUSIO N 
The resu lts, thus
, obtained have characterized and 
identified dye degrading efficiency of pseudomonas putida 
MTCC102. The ability of the strain to tolerate, decolorize 
and degrade azo dyes at high concentration gives it an advantage for treatment of textile industry wastewater. 
However, potential of culture needs to be demonstrated for 
its application in treatment of real dye bearing wastewaters 
using appropriate bioreactors.
