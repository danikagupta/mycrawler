EXECUTIVE SUMMARY :  
 
Dr. Schmidt is a Distinguished Professor, the J. Crayton Pruitt Family Endowed Chair , and former Department Chair for 
the University of Florida J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering. Prior to joining UF , Dr. Schmidt 
was the B.F. Goodrich Endowed Professor  at the University of Texas at Austin in both Biomedical Engineering (foun ding 
member) and Chemical Engineering.  
 
When Dr. Schmidt stepped down as Department Chair in May 2023 after a decade in this role, the J. Crayton Pruitt Family 
Department of Biomedical Engineering  encompassed 30 faculty, 500 undergraduates, 150 graduate students,  and 2 1 
department staff. UF  BME graduate and undergraduate programs were  ranked 12th and 10th, respectively, among national 
public programs (U.S. News & World Report, USNWR) . The undergraduate BME program first became ABET accredited 
in Fall 2019 and the graduate program ranking climbed over 21 spots (public) and almost 30 spots (overall) since 2013. Dr. 
Schmidt launched initiatives to increase the impact and visibility of the department, enhance engagement and enrich the 
culture of the department by strengthening partnerships, expanding interdisciplinary research and education, and increasing opportunities to translate engineering discoveries to biomedical applications . Dr. Schmidt has been devoted to diversity and 
inclusion. Since 2013, Dr. Schmidt recruited 22 faculty to the department, with women faculty increasing from 2 to 16 (55% 
women) and Black and Hispanic faculty increasing from 1 to 7 (24% URM). Moreover , research expenditures per faculty 
more than tripled and UF BME received >$3 M in new gifts and foundation and industrial support for innovative research 
and educational programs. Prior to joining UF, Dr. Schmidt was extensively involved in curricul a development and 
administration at UT Austin; she was one of four  founding members of UT Austin ’s BME Department. She served as 
inaugural Graduate Program Chair and Graduate Recruiter  and served as chair of the faculty search committee for many 
years, where she grew the new department to its current faculty size. She was instrumental in securing Whitaker Education 
funding and NSF IGERT training grants as well as implementing college programs to recruit and retain women faculty. 
 
Dr. Schmidt has held numerous leadership positions in professional organizations, including the American Institute of 
Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE), an honorific society of over 2,000 elected fellows representing the top 2% 
in the field, and the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), which has over 6,000 memb ers. For AIMBE, Dr. Schmidt 
served as President (2018- 2020) and as AIMBE’s Chair of the College of Fellows and as the Conference Organizer for 
AIMBE’s 25th Anniversary Meeting. As President, she introduced a new nomination process to focus on impact, which has 
increased diversity in fellows, and launched the AIMBE Impact Awards. For BMES, Dr. Schmidt served on the Board of 
Directors from 2011- 2015 and served as Conference Chair of the 2010 Annual BMES Meeting ( with over 3,000 attendees ). 
She has also served  as Chair of the BMES National Meetings Committee, Chair of the BMES Diversity Committee, and is 
a recur ring member of the BMES Fellows Selection Committee and the Awards and Nominations Committee s.  
 
Dr. Schmidt has over 25 years of experience in neural tissue engineering and wound healing, with over $25 M in funding 
and over 185 peer -reviewed papers and chapters (H-index=66), 34 issued U.S. patents, and has trained over 18 post -doctoral 
engineers and scientists (67% women and URM), 50 graduate students (50% women and URM), and hundreds of 
undergraduates in her laboratory. Dr. Schmidt is also active in innovation, commercialization , and clinical translation 
efforts. Her work is the foundation for the Ava nce Nerve Repair graft from Axogen (over 75,000 grafts implanted in 
patients) and VersaWrap from her affiliated start- up company, Alafair Biosciences  (over 12,000 grafts implanted ). Alafair 
Biosciences was recently listed on the 2023 Inc.5000 list of Fastest -Growing Private Companies in America. Dr. Schmidt 
is a Section Editor for Current Opinion in Biomedical Engineering and served as the inaugural Deputy Editor -in-Chief for 
Journal of Materials Chemistry B , a publication of the Royal Society of Chemistry, from 2012- 2016. She currently serves 
on editorial boards for Acta Biomaterialia, Journal of Neural Engineering, Tissue Engineering Part A, Journal of 
Biomedical Materials Research A, Journal of Biomaterial s Science -Polymer Edition, International Journal of 
Nanomedicine, and Nanomedicine . 
 
Dr. Schmidt has received numerous major awards and recognitions . She is a Fellow of AIMBE, the National Academy of 
Inventors (NAI), the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), the American Society for the Advancement of Science 
(AAAS), the International Academy of Medical and Biological Engineering (IAMBE), and the International Union of 
Societies for Biomaterials Science and Engineering (FBSE/IUSBSE). She is an inductee int o the Florida Inventors Hall of 
Fame and an elected member of the Florida Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine of Florida  (Florida’s equivalent 
to the National Academies).  Dr. Schmidt has received other prominent recognitions, including AIMBE’s pre stigious Pierre 
Galletti Award , the BMES Diversity Award (UF BME Representative) , the TERMIS- AM Commercialization/Innovation 
Award, the Clemson Award for Applied Research from Society For Biomaterials, the American Competitiveness and 
Innovation Fellowship from the National Science Foundation, and the Chairmen's Distinguished Life Sciences Award from 
Christopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation and U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  Last updated:  December 15, 2023   C. Schmidt   p. 2

VersaWrap is a natural , bioresorbable biomaterial film made of polysaccharides alginate and hyaluronic acid and 
commercialized by Alafair Biosciences, a start -up based in Austin, TX  in which Dr. Schmidt owns equity. Alafair 
Biosciences was listed on the 2023 Inc.5000 list of “Fastest -Growing Private Companies in America” . VersaWrap is 
used to address postoperative scarring and to protect tendons, nerves, skeletal muscle, and ligaments after surgery. 
VersaWrap was approved for tendon in December 2017, nerve in September 2020 , and for ligament and skeletal muscle  
in March 2021. VersaWrap is a class II medical device FDA cleared via several 510k's.  VersaWrap has over 12,000 
implants  and has been used by over 500 surgeons in over 400 different facilities, since its launch in December 2017.
