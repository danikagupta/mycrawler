However, intracellular inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) have recently been described in diverse prokaryotic and unicellular eukaryotic organisms (protists). In some cases, the mineral inclusions can be highly enriched in strontium and/or barium, indicating that these microorganisms have evolved cellular mechanisms to specifically concentrate these elements. Nevertheless, the biomineralization processes underlying the formation of these mineral inclusions are still poorly understood.  This manuscript first gathers the pre-existing information related to the formation of intracellular ACC inclusions in prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. It highlights the multiple unknown aspects of this type of biomineralization (physiological role, molecular mechanisms involved, etc.) as well as the apparent similarity of the mineral inclusions present in both groups of organisms. This similarity could be the result of a convergent evolution between organisms that are very distant phylogenetically. The work presented here then focuses on the biomineralization process occurring in the class of green microalgae Chlorodendrophyceae. Indeed, many species included in this class present intracellular ACC inclusions highly enriched in strontium, called micropearls. Experiments with laboratory cultures of Tetraselmis chui show that micropearl formation and cell growth are interdependent processes. Furthermore, micropearls are not randomly distributed during cell division, but are equally transferred to the daughter cells. This is probably due to a strong cellular control on micropearl location in the cytoplasm. It seems therefore that micropearls play an essential role in T. chui and, most likely, in other micropearl-forming species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae. Micropearl formation implies a strong uptake of calcium and strontium (if available in the medium) by the cells. Although calcium is essential for micropearl formation, strontium seems to compensate for low calcium levels in the culture medium, allowing the formation of strontium-rich micropearls and triggering cell growth. Micropearl formation is a rapid process, with calcium and strontium being transported from the culture  2 medium to the mineralization site in less than one hour. Although its function remains unknown, magnesium seems to be also involved in this biomineralization process, possibly as a stabilizer of ACC. In addition, an organic structure is observed around each micropearl and could be also related to their stabilization. However, its composition is not known yet.  In order to identify genes involved in micropearl formation, the genome and transcriptome of T. chui were sequenced. Through a differential RNA expression study, several genes that might be potentially related to this biomineralization process were identified. They mainly encode proteins involved in calcium and bicarbonate transport, as well as carbonic anhydrases.  Finally, this work shows the potential of T. chui as a bioremediation agent to treat aquatic environments contaminated with strontium-90 (radioactive). Indeed, this organism efficiently sequesters this radionuclide. Moreover, T. chui is a robust species and its growth can be easily optimized in bubble column photobioreactors, in which the addition of CO2 further accelerates the growth of the cultures and the strontium absorption.    3 Résumé  La formation intracellulaire de carbonate de calcium était traditionnellement considérée un processus rare chez les microorganismes. Cependant, des inclusions intracellulaires constituées de carbonate de calcium amorphe (CCA) ont récemment été décrites dans divers organismes procaryotes et eucaryotes unicellulaires (protistes). Dans certains cas, ces inclusions peuvent être fortement enrichies en strontium et/ou baryum, indiquant que ces organismes ont développé des mécanismes cellulaires pour concentrer ces éléments spécifiquement. Toutefois, ces processus de biominéralisation sont actuellement très mal compris. Dans un premier temps, ce manuscrit rassemble les informations préexistantes relatives à la formation d’inclusions intracellulaires en CCA chez les procaryotes et les eucaryotes. Ce travail met en évidence les nombreux aspects inconnus de ce type de biominéralisation (rôle physiologique, mécanismes moléculaires impliqués, etc.) ainsi que l’apparente similarité des inclusions minérales chez les deux groupes d’organismes, qui pourrait être le résultat d'une évolution convergente entre organismes très éloignés phylogénétiquement.  Dans un deuxième temps, ce travail de thèse se focalise dans le processus de biominéralisation observé dans des microalgues vertes de la classe des Chlorodendrophyceae. En effet, nombreuses espèces comprises dans cette classe présentent des inclusions en CCA enrichies en strontium, appelées microperles. Des expériences avec des cultures de laboratoire de l’espèce Tetraselmis chui montrent que la formation de microperles et la croissance cellulaire sont des processus interdépendants. En outre, les microperles ne sont pas distribuées aléatoirement au moment de la division cellulaire (mitose), mais sont équitablement réparties entre les cellules filles, probablement en raison d’un fort control cellulaire sur la localisation des microperles. Les microperles semblent donc jouer un rôle essentiel chez T. chui et, probablement, chez d’autres Chlorodendrophycées capables de former ces inclusions.  La formation de microperles implique une forte absorption de calcium et strontium (lorsqu’il est disponible dans le milieu) par les cellules. Bien que le calcium soit essentiel  4 pour la formation des microperles, le strontium semble compenser des faibles teneurs de calcium dans le milieu de culture, permettant la production de microperles riches en strontium ainsi que la croissance cellulaire. La formation de microperles est un processus rapide, le calcium et le strontium étant transportés depuis le milieu de culture jusqu’au site de minéralisation en moins d’une heure. Les deux éléments semblent emprunter les mêmes voies cellulaires pour atteindre les microperles. Bien que sa fonction reste inconnue, le magnésium semble être également impliqué dans ce processus de biominéralisation, possiblement en tant que stabilisateur du CCA. De plus, la présence d'une structure organique observée autour des microperles pourrait également être liée à la stabilisation des microperles, cependant, sa composition reste aussi inconnue.  Afin d’identifier des gènes impliqués dans la formation des microperles, le génome et le transcriptome de T. chui ont été séquencés et analysés. Par le bais de l’étude d’expression différentielle de l’ARN, plusieurs gènes potentiellement impliqués dans la formation des microperles ont été retenus. Ces gènes codent principalement pour des protéines impliquées dans le transport du calcium et du bicarbonate, ainsi que pour des anhydrases carboniques. Finalement, ce travail de thèse démontre le potentiel de T. chui en tant qu'agent de bioremédiation pour traiter les milieux aquatiques pollués au strontium-90 (radioactif). En effet, cet organisme est capable d’absorber efficacement le strontium-90 présent dans le milieu. De plus, T. chui est une espèce robuste et sa croissance peut être facilement optimisée dans des photobioréacteurs à colonnes à bulles, dans lesquels l’ajout de CO2 accélère d’avantage la croissance des cultures et l’absorption de strontium.     5 Acknowledgments  This manuscript is the final step of a PhD work that would not have been possible without the support and trust of my supervisors Daniel Ariztegui, Montserrat Filella, and Karl Perron, and the generous funding of the Gebert Rüf Stiftung (Basel, Switzerland).

 14 1.1. Biomineralization: definition, types, and functions Biomineralization is the natural process by which living organisms produce minerals. It involves the selective uptake of certain elements and their transport into specific functional structures, under strict biological control (Mann, 2001). Although the term biomineralization can also encompass the biologically-induced mineral precipitation (Weiner and Dove, 2003; Dupraz et al., 2009), in this work it will refer exclusively to the biologically-controlled mineralization.  The field of biomineralization connects the living and the mineral world, standing at the interface of various scientific disciplines such as biology, biotechnology, chemistry, and geology (among others). Traditionally, this field was studied following a descriptive approach. However, in recent decades, there has been a growing interest in understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation of biominerals, strongly controlled by genes (Mann, 2009). The term biomineral refers to a mineral produced by a living organism. This type of minerals has different properties from minerals formed in inorganic systems (abiotically). Almost all biominerals are composed of both mineral and organic compounds (Weiner and Dove, 2003). In addition, since their formation takes place under strongly controlled conditions, biominerals also differ from their inorganically formed counterparts by their specific crystallinity, isotopic and trace metal composition, as well as by their morphology (Fig. 1) (Weiner and Dove, 2003). Biominerals are observed in a wide range of organisms. Indeed, the capacity of forming biominerals has been observed in all the taxonomic kingdoms, from prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes (protists) to multicellular complex organisms (Veis, 2008). Biomineralization can take place intra- or extracellularly. Intracellular biomineralization normally takes place within membrane-bounded subcellular compartments, whereas the extracellular formation of biominerals occurs on/within an insoluble macromolecular framework outside the cell (Mann, 2001). Different types of biominerals have been described according to their chemical composition, structure, and function. For example, diatoms are well-known for their capacity to build silica shells (called frustules) that confer protection against predators and UV light (De Tommasi et al., 2017), whereas magnetotactic bacteria form linear Chapter I 
 15 chains of magnetite crystals in the intracellular space, acting as internal compass needles (Frankel and Blakemore, 1980). Calcium-bearing biominerals are the most widespread, representing more than 50% percent of the known biogenic minerals (Lowenstam and Weiner, 1989). Within this group, calcium carbonate minerals are the most abundant, existing under different forms (polymorphs): calcite, aragonite, vaterite, monohydrocalcite, and amorphous calcium carbonate (Lowenstam and Weiner, 1989; Addadi et al., 2003; Weiner and Dove, 2003). Calcite and aragonite are, by far, the most common polymorphs produced by organisms due to their high stability at ambient temperature and pressure (Mann, 2001). Microorganisms such as coccolithophores and foraminifera produce, respectively, calcite scales and calcite or aragonite shells that serve as exoskeletons (Raven and Knoll, 2010). Mollusk shells and coral exoskeletons can also be composed of both calcite and aragonite (Falini et al., 1996). Calcite crystals are also found in the human inner ear, acting as gravity sensors (called otoliths) (Mann, 2001). Vaterite and monohydrocalcite are less stable calcium carbonate minerals. They have been observed in spicules of ascidians (Lowenstam and Abbott, 1975; Aizenberg et al., 2002), stiffening the internal tissues. In addition, vaterite has also been detected in other organisms such as mollusks and plants (Setoguchi et al., 1989; Falini et al., 1996; Addadi et al., 2003).

Amorphous calcium carbonate: an overlooked calcium carbonate polymorph in biological systems Amorphous calcium carbonate, also called ACC, is the least stable calcium carbonate polymorph and the only one not diffracting X-rays because it exhibits a poorly-ordered atomic arrangement (Beniash et al., 1997). At its pure state, ACC is highly unstable and soluble under physiological conditions (Brečević and Nielsen, 1989; Clarkson et al., 1992). Despite its high instability, ACC has been found in a wide variety of species, either as a stabilized form or as a precursor phase (which later transforms to a more crystalline form such as calcite), known as stable and transient ACC, respectively (Addadi et al., 2003; De Yoreo et al., 2015; Albéric et al., 2018). Some studies suggest that ACC acts as a temporary storage of calcium in organisms such as gastropods (Watabe et al., 1976). In other organisms, such as crustaceans, ACC is believed to confer mechanical strength to the skeletal elements (Greenaway, 1985; Aizenberg et al., 1996; Weiner et al., 2003). On the other hand, it has been observed that the formation of calcite spicules in urchin larvae occurs by deposition of ACC that is subsequently crystallized into calcite (Beniash et al., 1997; Weiner et al., 2003). Additionally, the aragonitic shells of some larval bivalves have also been shown to form through the deposition of transient phases of ACC (Weiss et al., 2002).  In biological systems, ACC is stabilized by the presence of additives such as magnesium, phosphate, and specific proteins, as well as when confined in space (Aizenberg et al., 1996; Addadi et al., 2003; Weiner et al., 2003; Albéric et al., 2018). However, the unstable nature of ACC makes its study in biological systems rather difficult.  Over the last decade, several microorganisms have been shown to form intracellular inclusions of stable ACC which had been overlooked in the past. Among these organisms, special attention has been paid to certain cyanobacteria and various species of green microalgae within the class Chlorodendrophyceae (Benzerara et al., 2014; Martignier et al., 2017). Interestingly, although they are phylogenetically distant, both groups of organisms form similar ACC inclusions, in some cases containing significant amounts of strontium (Blondeau et al., 2018; Martignier et al., 2018).  Chapter I 
 17 This finding proved that the intracellular biomineralization of calcium carbonate in microorganisms is a more common process than previously thought. Indeed, apart from some well-known exceptions (i.e., coccolithophores or the giant sulfur bacterium Achromatium), the formation of calcium carbonate by microorganisms was considered an extracellular process.  1.3. The class of green microalgae Chlorodendrophyceae The class of green microalgae Chlorodendrophyceae is included in the phylum Chlorophyta (Fig. 2), which in turn belongs to the Viridiplantae subkingdom. This class is composed of two genera: Tetraselmis F. Stein, 1878 (including 34 species) and Scherffelia (Perty) Pascher, 1912 (including two species) (Guiry and Guiry, 2021). Sometimes, a third genus is also included: Prasinocladus Kuckuck, 1894. Traditionally, species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae were considered members of the Prasinophyceae (Leliaert et al., 2012).   
 Figure 2: Phylogeny of the main lineages of green microalgae. Figure modified from Zhang et al. (2022).   The class Chlorodendrophyceae is composed of unicellular organisms that present a shape from elliptical to almost spherical. During the motile stage, cells present an invagination at the anterior part, from which four flagella emerge (Manton and Parke, 1965). Chlorodendrophyceae present a cell wall, also called theca, composed of fused 
Chapter I 
 18 organic scales, consisting of carbohydrates, proteins, calcium, and sulfate (Manton and Parke, 1965; Becker et al., 1991). These scales are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and are subsequently translocated to the cell surface via Golgi-derived secretory vesicles. Chlorodendrophyceae reproduce by asexual division within the parental periplasm (sexual reproduction is unknown in the class). Some species form vegetative thick-walled cysts that germinate by division into four cells (Arora et al., 2013). Species belonging to the genus Tetraselmis present a single chloroplast and a pyrenoid, while Scherffelia species possess two chloroplasts but no pyrenoid (Melkonian and Preisig, 1986).  As previously mentioned, it has been recently discovered that several species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae (including both genera Tetraselmis and Scherffelia) form intracellular inclusions of stable ACC, called micropearls (Martignier, 2019). These mineral inclusions occupy the interlobular spaces of the chloroplast(s), showing different distribution patterns according to the chloroplast morphology of each species (Fig. 3) (Martignier et al., 2020). Micropearls can present high concentrations of strontium, showing concentric layers in the inner structure that correspond to variations in the calcium and strontium concentrations (Martignier et al., 2018). Although the function of micropearls is not yet understood, it has been suggested that they might be related to cell motility, flagellar shedding and regeneration, and/or theca formation (Martignier et al., 2020). Regarding their formation process, it has been suggested that they can form within intracellular vesicles. However, this has not yet been confirmed (Martignier et al., 2017).  Although most Chlorodendrophyceae live in marine environments, some species are found in freshwater, brackish, and hypersaline environments (Borowitzka, 2018). Most species are planktonic or benthic, whereas a few species have been described as endosymbionts (Serôdio et al., 2011).  Chapter I

They appear as translucent/white inclusions in light microscopy images (A, C, and E). In SEM images, they appear as bright white granules (B, D, and F). Figure modified from Martignier et al. (2020). Scale bars: 10 µm. 1.4. The wide application potential of Chlorodendrophyceae Many species within the genus Tetraselmis are robust and easy to culture, showing a large application potential. Indeed, several Tetraselmis strains show rapid growth, high halotolerance, and resistance to bacterial contamination. These properties make them very versatile organisms (Fabregas et al., 1984; Schulze et al., 2017; Trovão et al., 2019). In addition, some of these strains accumulate a significant amount of fat, increasing their nutritional value (Ishika et al., 2018). It is therefore not surprising that species such as T. tetrathele, T. suecica, and T. chui are commonly used as aquaculture feeds (Benemann, 
Chapter I 
 20 1992). Additionally, several Tetraselmis strains have recently gained special interest for their potential as sustainable sources of biofuel and other high-value products such as carotenoids and antioxidants (Fig. 4) (Perez-Garcia et al., 2011; Bondioli et al., 2012; Fon-Sing and Borowitzka, 2016). Tetraselmis microalgae have also been investigated for bioremediation purposes, as potential agents for CO2 mitigation, wastewater treatment, and heavy metal removal (Pérez-Rama et al., 2002; Moheimani, 2016; Kassim and Meng, 2017; Pereira et al., 2018). Moreover, the recent discovery of strontium-rich micropearls in many species included in the class Chlorodendrophyceae also suggested the possible use of these organisms for the development of new bioremediation techniques regarding radioactive strontium-90 contamination (Martignier et al., 2018). However, the strontium uptake capacity of these organisms has never been studied.

Strontium-90 contamination in the environment Strontium-90 is an unstable isotope (= radioactive) of anthropogenic origin that emits β radiation. It is formed by nuclear fission and is considered one of the most hazardous radionuclides due to its relatively long half-life (29 years) and its high mobility (Atwood, 2013). In the past, nuclear disasters such as Fukushima and Chernobyl contributed to the release of this radionuclide into the environment, contaminating soils, sediments, waterbodies, flora, and fauna (Pathak and Gupta, 2020). Indeed, due to its high mobility, 
Chapter I 
 21 strontium-90 is rapidly incorporated into the food chain (Hoffman et al., 1984; Nabeshi et al., 2015). In humans, the ingestion of water and food contaminated with strontium-90 can cause its accumulation in bone tissue due to its chemical resemblance to calcium (ATSDR, 2004). This can lead to serious health problems such as leukemia and cancer.  Traditional remediation techniques to treat radioactive contamination include processes such as nanofiltration, ion exchange with resins, or selective adsorption (among others) (ONR, 2020; Pathak and Gupta, 2020). However, these procedures present important technical limitations, as well as high economic and energy costs. Thus, there is currently a growing interest in developing new remediation techniques that involve the use of microorganisms, including microalgae (Lloyd and Renshaw, 2005; Fukuda et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014). 1.6. Aim of this work and thesis overview The aim of this PhD thesis is to understand the biomineralization process underlying the formation of intracellular inclusions of stable ACC (micropearls) in Chlorodendrophyceae and to study their potential as bioremediation agents to treat radioactive strontium-90 contamination. This research work is a follow-up of a project that started in summer 2011 in the Earth Sciences Department of the University of Geneva, when intracellular inclusions of ACC were observed for the first time in planktonic samples collected from Lake Geneva (Switzerland).  Due to the multidisciplinary nature of this project, different scientific approaches have been applied to the work presented here. The following chapters present the results of this thesis, each corresponding to a different research stage and scientific approach. From Chapter II to V, the micropearl formation process is investigated, whereas Chapters VI and VII focus on the bioremediation potential of Chlorodendrophyceae. Chapters have been formatted as scientific manuscripts that have been published or are in preparation to be submitted to peer-reviewed scientific journals.  Chapter I 
 22 Chapter II: Micropearls and other intracellular inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate: an unsuspected biomineralization capacity shared by diverse microorganisms Published in 2021 in Environmental Microbiology, this review article gathers for the first time the existing information about the biomineralization processes involved in the formation of intracellular ACC inclusions in microorganisms, including both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This paper provides a broad vision of the topic and discusses different aspects such as the possible molecular processes involved in the formation of these mineral inclusions, their physiological role, and the impact of microorganisms forming ACC inclusions on the geochemical cycles of alkaline earth metals. Moreover, it highlights the great similarity of these ACC inclusions between prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and suggests a convergent evolution (independent evolution) resulting in comparable biomineralization processes in both groups. Chapter III: High calcium and strontium uptake by the green microalga Tetraselmis chui is related to micropearl formation and cell growth Published in 2022 in Environmental Microbiology Reports, this article investigates the micropearl formation process and its function in the class Chlorodendrophyceae. The study was performed with laboratory cultures of Tetraselmis chui (forming micropearls) and Tetraselmis marina (not forming micropearls) and evidences a high uptake of calcium and strontium by T. chui cells, related to micropearl formation and cell growth.  Chapter IV: Genome and transcriptome analysis of Tetraselmis chui: identification of genes potentially related to micropearl formation  This chapter identifies a series of genes that could be potentially involved in the micropearl formation process in T. chui. For this purpose, the complete genome and transcriptome of T. chui were sequenced and annotated. Then, a differential RNA expression analysis was performed in T. chui cells grown under unfavorable and favorable conditions for micropearl formation.  Chapter I 
 23 Chapter V: The micropearl formation process from an intracellular perspective  In this chapter, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observation of T. chui ultrastructure reveals a monolayered structure of unknown nature around micropearls that is potentially involved in the formation and stabilization of these ACC inclusions. In addition, the elemental composition of T. chui cytoplasm is imaged using Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS), showing that calcium and strontium are incorporated into micropearls faster than expected, and that magnesium and sulfur might play an important role in micropearl formation. Finally, this chapter presents a protocol for micropearl extraction that could be useful for future research.  Chapter VI: The green microalga Tetraselmis chui as a bioremediation agent for strontium-90 contamination This chapter, which will be submitted to the journal Environmental Science and Technology, investigates the capacity of T. chui to sequester radioactive strontium-90 from the growth medium. It confirms the high potential of micropearl-forming species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae to be used as bioremediation agents to treat strontium-90 contamination in aquatic environments.  Chapter VII: Optimization of Tetraselmis chui growth in bubble column photobioreactors for strontium removal In this chapter, the growth of T. chui cultures is optimized in bubble column photobioreactors with a view to developing large-scale culture systems for strontium-90 bioremediation purposes. Cultures were amended with natural strontium (stable, non-radioactive) as a proof of concept. Results demonstrate the suitability of these culture systems for strontium removal from seawater. Additionally, CO2 injections in the culture system are shown to further accelerate cell growth and strontium absorption by T. chui cells. This chapter will be part of an article that will be submitted to Algal Research. Finally, Chapter VIII summarizes the different aspects discussed in this thesis and presents new research possibilities on the subject. Chapter I

  30 2.1. Abstract An unsuspected biomineralization process, which produces intracellular inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), was recently discovered in unicellular eukaryotes. These mineral inclusions, called micropearls, can be highly enriched with other alkaline-earth metals (AEM) such as Sr and Ba. Similar intracellular inclusions of ACC have also been observed in prokaryotic organisms. These comparable biomineralization processes involving phylogenetically distant microorganisms are not entirely understood yet. This review gives a broad vision of the topic in order to establish a basis for discussion on the possible molecular processes behind the formation of the inclusions, their physiological role, the impact of these microorganisms on the geochemical cycles of AEM, and their evolutionary relationship. Finally, some insights are provided to guide future research. 2.2. Introduction Biomineralization is a biologically-controlled process by which living organisms form minerals from the selective extraction of certain chemical elements present in their environment (Mann, 2001; Dupraz et al., 2009). Some authors also include in the definition of biomineralization the biologically-induced mineralization, where the metabolic activity of some organisms changes the surrounding environmental conditions and triggers mineral precipitation (Weiner and Dove, 2003).  A large number of organisms form minerals (from prokaryotes to pluricellular eukaryotes) and this process can take place at different locations: (i) in the extracellular space (outside the cell), (ii) in the intercellular space (between cells), (iii) in the epicellular space (on the cell walls) or (iv) in the intracellular space (inside the cells) (Mann, 2001). For simplicity, the epicellular and intercellular spaces can be considered as extracellular locations.  In microorganisms, the chemical and mineralogical composition as well as the physiological function of biominerals vary depending on the group of organisms forming them and the solution chemistry. For instance, magnetotactic bacteria form intracellular structures called magnetosomes, that are composed of magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4), acting as geomagnetic field sensors (Schüler and Frankel, 1999), whereas diatoms Chapter II 
  31 present silica (SiO2 · nH2O) shells, known as frustules, that act as exoskeletons and confer protection against mechanical stress and UV light (Hamm et al., 2003; Ingalls et al., 2010).  Calcium carbonate biominerals are the most abundant and widespread minerals among organisms (Weiner and Dove, 2003). There are five main polymorphic biogenic varieties of calcium carbonate in descending order of thermodynamic stability at ambient conditions: calcite, aragonite, vaterite, monohydrocalcite, and amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) (Levi-Kalisman et al., 2002; Addadi et al., 2003; Weiner and Dove, 2003). While the first three minerals are anhydrous crystalline polymorphs, monohydrocalcite is a hydrated crystalline mineral. According to Addadi et al. (2003), ACC is the least stable polymorph, including both hydrated and anhydrous forms (called stable and transient forms, respectively).  Several strains of cyanobacteria are known to be involved in the extracellular formation of microbial carbonates, called microbialites (Burne and Moore, 1987; Riding, 2000). Indeed, the photosynthetic activity of these prokaryotic organisms modifies the surrounding environmental conditions by rising the alkalinity, which triggers the extracellular precipitation of calcium carbonate (Arp et al., 2001; Ludwig et al., 2005; Liang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016). Foraminifera and coccolithophores are the major unicellular eukaryotes (protists) that produce calcium carbonate to form, respectively, epicellular shells and scales that act as protective structures (Mann, 2001; Madigan et al., 2010; Raven and Knoll, 2010). In foraminifera, the shells can be composed of either calcite or aragonite, while coccolithophores only present calcite scales called coccoliths. Some studies suggest that Ca and carbonate destined to mineralize the shell of foraminifera may be previously stored in intracellular pools as ACC (Erez, 2003; Bentov and Erez, 2006; Khalifa et al., 2016), but such inclusions have never been described. On the other hand, the formation of coccoliths is an entirely intracellular process (Brownlee et al., 2020) and vacuole-like-compartments containing a phosphorous-rich disordered calcium phase have been observed (Sviben et al., 2016).  Apart from coccolithophores and a few isolated cases, such as the giant sulfur bacterium Achromatium (class Gammaproteobacteria) (Head et al., 2000; Gray, 2006; Isambert et al., 2007; Taoka et al., 2014; Schorn et al., 2020), the formation of calcium carbonate by Chapter II 
  32 microorganisms has traditionally been considered an extracellular process, the detection of intracellular ACC being extremely rare. Only a few forgotten cases of intracellular ACC inclusions had been reported in some marine and freshwater ciliates in the past (Fauré-Fremiet and Gauchery, 1957).  In recent years, several studies have revealed the ability of some phylogenetically distant microorganisms to form intracellular ACC inclusions that can contain other alkaline-earth metals (AEM): from cyanobacteria (Benzerara et al., 2014) and magnetotactic Alphaproteobacteria (Monteil et al., 2020) to unicellular eukaryotes (Martignier et al., 2017). In addition, it has been shown that the intracellular mineral inclusions of the giant sulfur bacterium Achromatium, which have been commonly described as calcite bodies, are actually composed of ACC (Benzerara et al., 2020). In unicellular eukaryotes, these inclusions, called micropearls, present internal concentric zonations due to frequent slight variations in their chemical composition (Martignier et al., 2017). Interestingly, similar concentric structures have also been described in the intracellular ACC inclusions of several cyanobacteria (Benzerara et al., 2014). However, the physiological function of these inclusions, as well as the molecular mechanisms involved in their formation in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms are poorly known to date. This review aims to compile the existing information about the intracellular ACC biomineralization process in microorganisms as a basis for discussion on the molecular mechanisms involved, the biological role of intracellular ACC, the impact of these organisms on the environment, and their possible evolutionary relationships. Finally, we also suggest future research directions to achieve a deeper understanding of the topic. 2.3. Intracellular ACC inclusions in protists (micropearls) In 2013, different types of intracellular Ba and Sr enriched ACC inclusions were observed in eukaryotic organisms for the first time in Lake Geneva (Switzerland, France) during a routine examination of plankton using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (Jaquet et al., 2013). This finding was the first evidence of an unexpected intracellular ACC biomineralization process in protists. The mineral inclusions appeared as bright spheres Chapter II 
  33 of diameters between 0.6 and 3 µm, and several types were differentiated according to their composition. Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca atomic ratios of the micropearls were, respectively, measured to be up to 4800 and 10 times higher than in the surrounding lake water (Jaquet et al., 2013). Further investigations confirmed that the inclusions, known as micropearls, are produced in the intracellular space of certain protists and their chemical composition is specific to the different organisms forming them (Martignier et al., 2017). Microorganisms producing Ba-rich micropearls, called here “Ba-organisms”, are still undetermined (Fig. 1A); however, the green microalga Tetraselmis cordiformis (class Chlorodendrophyceae) has been identified as the organism forming Sr-rich ACC inclusions in Lake Geneva (Martignier et al., 2017; Martignier et al., 2018). Micropearls were also found in cultured strains of T. cordiformis obtained from algae collections (Fig. 1B). More recently, ACC inclusions have been found to be a widespread trait within the class Chlorodendrophyceae (Martignier et al., 2018; Martignier et al., 2020), composed of two genera: Tetraselmis (mainly including marine species) and Scherffelia (including a single freshwater species) (Fig. 1C).

ChlorodendrophyceaeChapter II 
  35 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observation of ultra-thin cross-sections of different Chlorodendrophyceae algae shows that the inclusions are located close to the cell surface, under the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A) (Martignier et al., 2017; Martignier et al., 2018), while SEM observation reveals different distribution patterns of the micropearls between species (Fig. 1B, 1C and 3). A relationship between the chloroplast morphology and the distribution pattern of micropearls has recently been highlighted (Martignier et al., 2020): species having a common distribution pattern of micropearls share the same chloroplast morphology. The four-lobed chloroplast of T. striata, T. chui, T. levis, T. suecica, and T. tetrathele explains the four longitudinal alignments of micropearls appearing at the apical pole of the cell (observed as three equidistant lines in the SEM because one line is hidden at the other side of the cell) since the inclusions are occupying the interlobular spaces of the chloroplast (Fig. 3A). T. desikacharyi and T. contracta present a chloroplast with more than eight lobes, explaining the arrangement of micropearls forming numerous parallel longitudinal lines distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). The freshwater species T. cordiformis has a net-like chloroplast that causes both the apical grouping of the micropearls and their dispersion within the cell (Fig. 3C). Finally, micropearls are clustered at the posterior pole of T. convolutae cells due to the cup-like shape of their chloroplast (Fig. 3D). There also appears to be a relationship between the habitat of the organisms and the shape and distribution pattern of the micropearls (Martignier et al., 2018; Martignier et al., 2020). Strains sampled in the sand of a marine estuary (T. contracta and T. desikacharyi) show a similar distribution pattern of the micropearls (Fig. 3B) that differs from that observed in seawater, free-swimming strains (T. chui, T. suecica, T. tetrathele, etc.) (Fig 3A). In addition, while freshwater species present spherical micropearls (Fig. 1B, 1C and 3C), seawater strains form elongated micropearls similar to rice grains (Fig. 3A and 3B). Chlorodendrophyceae strains not forming micropearls (T. ascus and T. marina) tend to be colonial and form sessile structures. SEM observation of the organisms forming Ba-rich ACC inclusions in Lake Geneva indicates that they are unicellular eukaryotic organisms with cell sizes varying between 10 and 20 µm and two flagella emerging from one cell pole (Fig. 1A). The smaller cells present micropearls with higher concentrations of Ba (Martignier et al., 2017).  Chapter II

Chapter II 
  38  TEM-Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (TEM-EDXS) analyses of ultra-thin cross-sections of Ba and Sr-rich micropearls, obtained using Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technology, reveal internal concentric zonation (nanometric concentric layers of different atomic masses) corresponding to variations in the Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios around a rod-shaped nucleus (Fig. 2A and 2B). In both types of organisms, Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) confirm that micropearls are composed of amorphous carbonate (Martignier et al., 2017; Martignier et al., 2018). In addition, the electron beam triggers bubble formation in the micropearls, suggesting the evaporation of a fluid such as water. Therefore, the composition of micropearls can be related to hydrated amorphous carbonates that are enriched in AEM such as Sr or Ba. High-resolution elemental mapping using Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) shows the presence of S in the organic matter at the surface of both types of micropearls, probably due to the presence of proteins. Carbon-nitrogen (CN) and S signals are higher in the surrounding area of Sr-micropearls than in Ba-inclusions, suggesting different biomineralization mechanisms (Martignier et al., 2017; Martignier et al., 2018). Finally, SEM-EDXS analyses also show different Sr accumulation capacities between Tetraselmis strains: T. desikacharyi micropearls present the highest Sr/Ca ratio compared to the culture medium composition (>300 times higher), while T. contracta and T. cordiformis are the strains showing the lowest Sr accumulation capacities (Martignier et al., 2018).  2.4. Intracellular ACC inclusions in prokaryotes 2.4.1. Cyanobacteria In a parallel research line, the use of electron microscopy for the study of biofilms associated with modern microbialites from the hyperalkaline Lake Alchichica (Mexico) revealed in 2012 the presence of intracellular ACC bioprecipitates in the early-branching microbialite cyanobacterium Gloeomargarita lithophora (order Gloeobacterales) (Couradeau et al., 2012). This finding provided the first evidence of a biologically-controlled mineralization of calcium carbonate in the intracellular space of Chapter II 
  39 cyanobacteria. Interestingly, these carbonates also contained other AEM such as Mg, Sr and Ba. In 2014, SEM observation of cyanobacteria of all the subsections (I, II, III, IV, and V) established by Rippka et al. (1979) showed that intracellular biomineralization of ACC is a widespread phenomenon in cyanobacteria, including the strain Candidatus Synechococcus calcipolaris, also isolated from Lake Alchichica (Benzerara et al., 2014). ACC precipitates of G. lithophora were observed using SEM (in secondary electron and backscattered electron modes) as bright and spherical inclusions with an average diameter of 270 ± 44 nm (Fig. 1D) (Couradeau et al., 2012). There were 21 ± 5 inclusions per cell that occupied 6% of the total cell volume, increasing by 12% the cell density. In most of the cells, the inclusions were scattered throughout the cytoplasm; however, sometimes they appeared to be aligned, forming one or several chains (Li et al., 2016).The phylogenetically remote cyanobacteria Cyanothece sp. PCC 7425 and Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203, both obtained from a culture collection, also presented ACC inclusions with a shape and a distribution pattern similar to those observed in G. lithophora (Benzerara et al., 2014). More recently, other strains close to Cyanothece sp. PCC 7425 and Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203 have been also discovered to form this type of ACC inclusions: Cyanothece sp. PCC 8303, PCC 8905 and PCC 9303, and C. thermalis PCC 7432, PCC 7433, PCC 7434, PCC 7439 and PCC 9819 (De Wever et al., 2019).  The strains Ca. S. calcipolaris G9, Synechococcus sp. PCC 6312, S. lividus PCC 6716 and PCC 6717, and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (all from the same ancestral lineage) presented a different distribution pattern of intracellular ACC inclusions, lying at the cell poles and, sometimes, in the middle of the cells (Fig. 1E) (Benzerara et al., 2014). The number of inclusions per cell pole varied from 5 to 40 and the diameter of the inclusions from 90 to 300 nm. The inclusions located in the middle of the cell had a diameter comprised between 50 and 150 nm and they seemed to be related to the formation of the cell division septum (Benzerara et al., 2014). Similar ACC inclusions have also been found in Synechococcus sp. PCC 6603 and PCC 6715 (De Wever et al., 2019).  SAED showed the amorphous structure of the inclusions of G. lithophora, and EDXS analyses indicated a chemical composition similar to the mineral benstonite ((Sr1Ba2.7Mg1.4Ca0.9)Ca6Mg(CO3)13). Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca atomic ratios were respectively 1370 and 86 times higher than in the growth medium, suggesting the implication of active Chapter II 
  40 import mechanisms to selectively concentrate these elements (Couradeau et al., 2012). Indeed, in a culture medium containing a relatively high concentration of Ca and a low concentration of Sr and Ba, G. lithophora preferentially accumulates Ba in the intracellular ACC inclusions, followed by Sr and Ca (Cam et al., 2016). The different AEM contained in the ACC inclusions are frequently deposited sequentially, forming concentric layers (Fig. 2C and 2D). The inner part of the inclusions (called core) can be composed of pure Ca, pure Ba, or almost pure Sr compounds, while the outer part (called shell) can be composed of either one or more layers, each enriched in one of these elements.  The incorporation of Ca, Sr and Ba by ACC-forming cyanobacteria is also reflected in the variation of the chemical composition of the culture medium in which they grow (Cam et al., 2016; Blondeau et al., 2018a; Cam et al., 2018). In G. lithophora cultures with an initial concentration of 250 µM of Ca, 50 µM Sr, and 50 µM of Ba, a decrease of Ba in solution is noticed first, followed by the decrease of Sr and finally of Ca. However, Cyanothece sp. does not show the selective incorporation of Sr and Ba under the same culture conditions as G. lithophora, and the layered structure of the carbonate inclusions is not observed, suggesting that the preferential uptake of Sr and Ba is not a common feature to all ACC-forming cyanobacteria (Cam et al., 2016).  2.4.2. Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria A recent study also attributes the ability to form intracellular ACC inclusions to an undescribed genus of magnetotactic bacteria within the class Alphaproteobacteria (Monteil et al., 2020), a phylogenetically distant group from cyanobacteria. The studied strain was isolated from the sediment-water interface of Lake Pavin (France) and presents intracellular ACC inclusions in addition to magnetosomes (Fig. 1F). The inclusions occupy most of the cytoplasm and also contain Sr and Ba. Surprisingly, it has also been shown that the intracellular inclusions of calcium carbonate contained in the well-known gammaproteobacterium Achromatium are composed of ACC and not calcite as commonly thought (Benzerara et al., 2020). Achromatium cells were also collected from Lake Pavin and the mineral inclusions were analyzed using Raman microspectroscopy and SEM. The inclusions present a laminated structure (Yang Chapter II 
  41 et al., 2019) that could be similar to the layered structure observed in the ACC inclusions of unicellular eukaryotes (Martignier et al., 2017) and cyanobacteria (Cam et al., 2016). 2.5. Formation of intracellular ACC inclusions in prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes  Studies involving the production of synthetic hydrated ACC suggest a spontaneous dehydration of this polymorph in aqueous environments, leading to the formation of calcite, aragonite, and/or vaterite crystals (Radha et al., 2010; Rodriguez-Blanco et al., 2011; Bots et al., 2012). The accommodation of impurities (additives) in the mineral structure enhances the thermal stability of ACC by avoiding dehydration (Goodwin et al., 2010; Albéric et al., 2018). Hence, ACC might be stabilized in biological environments by the presence of organic macromolecules (such as polysaccharides or proteins) and the addition of some inorganic compounds (such as Mg and phosphate) (Taylor et al., 1993; Mann, 2001; Levi-Kalisman et al., 2002; Gal et al., 2012). In addition, the isolation of ACC in closed systems (e.g., intracellular vesicles) may also contribute to its stabilization (Cam et al., 2015; Mavromatis et al., 2017; Martignier, 2019).  In microorganisms, the biochemical mechanisms explaining the formation and stabilization of intracellular ACC inclusions are still unknown. This is also the case for the selective incorporation of AEM achieved by several of the unicellular organisms producing these inclusions. An abiotic theory concerning the formation of Ba and Sr-rich sulfate inclusions in the green alga Closterium moniliferum suggests the preferential uptake of Ba and Sr over Ca due to the sulfate-trap model (Krejci et al., 2011). This abiotic model explains preferential precipitation of (Ba,Sr)SO4 due to its lower solubility compared to that of SrSO4 and CaSO4. However, a process in which the formation of the inclusion implies a biological control and a selective active import of Ba and Sr seems more realistic regarding intracellular ACC inclusions (Cam et al., 2016). Some ACC-forming microorganisms have been observed in undersaturated solutions, which is an unfavorable condition to precipitate carbonates (Cam et al., 2018). Therefore, the formation of ACC is most likely an active process (costing energy), allowing the supersaturation of the intracellular solution with AEM carbonates (Cam et al., 2015; Li et Chapter II 
  42 al., 2016; Martignier et al., 2017). A biotic-abiotic mixed model has been suggested regarding micropearl formation in Chlorodendrophyceae algae; it combines intracellular pre-concentration of Sr and Ba with a solid solution growing mechanism (Thien et al., 2017). Oscillatory zoning, whereby chemical composition varies more or less regularly along a core-to-rim profile, is a well-known characteristic of solid solution growth (Prieto et al., 1997). Biomineralization of micropearls in at least two different protists seems to start with a rod-shaped nucleus probably composed of organic matter (Fig. 2A and 2B) (Martignier et al., 2018). In cyanobacteria, it has been proposed that the organization and defined distribution patterns of Ca-inclusions in the cytoplasm may also involve a control by the cytoskeleton, which could be implicated in nucleation mechanisms leading to the formation of the inclusions (Benzerara et al., 2014).  The formation of ACC inclusions in cyanobacteria has been suggested to take place in intracellular vesicle-like structures, avoiding direct contact with the cytoplasmic solution that could affect the stability of the inclusions (Cam et al., 2015). In a recent study using both freeze-substitution sample preparation and cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) technologies, Blondeau et al. (2018b) demonstrate the presence of ~2.5 nm thick structures of unknown nature around the ACC inclusions of cyanobacteria (Fig. 4). Two hypotheses are proposed regarding the nature of these structures: they are either protein shells or lipid monolayers. In the case of the Alphaproteobacterium undescribed genus from Lake Pavin, a lipid bilayer surrounding the ACC precipitates has been noticed using CEMOVIS (Monteil et al., 2020). It has also been suggested that the ACC granules in Achromatium are confined by lipid bilayers (Gray and Head, 2014; Benzerara et al., 2020). Although these structures have not yet been observed in microalgae, the occurrence of S and CN surrounding the micropearls could indicate the presence of a proteinaceous layer (Martignier et al., 2017).

Recently, at least three types of genes have been detected in all the cyanobacteria strains presenting ACC inclusions: a gene encoding for a mechanosensitive channel that is probably involved in Ca import, a Ca2+/H+ transporter, and UPF0016 membrane proteins that may be related to the active transport of Ca (De Wever et al., 2019). However, these genes do not appear to be specific to ACC-forming cyanobacteria, as similar genes could be found in other species that do not form intracellular ACC (De Wever et al., 2019). Thus, future studies are needed to decipher the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of these intracellular inclusions. 2.6. Physiological role of ACC inclusions ACC has been found in several phyla (Plantae, Porifera, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, Mollusca, and Arthropoda) and can constitute temporary storage deposits, a stiffener of certain tissues, or a precursor phase of a crystalline mineral (Addadi et al., 2003; Radha et al., 2010). A study of extracellular ACC inclusions in Ficus leaves, called cystoliths, 
Chapter II 
  44 indicated that this mineral could also be involved in the regulation of intracellular pH (Gal et al., 2012).  The biological functions of ACC inclusions in bacteria and microalgae are still largely unknown. However, when cultured in a growth medium with an initial concentration of 50 µM of Ca, the growth rate of ACC-forming cyanobacteria is limited compared to cultures with an initial concentration of 250 µM of Ca. Moreover, after 527 hours of culture, the addition of 200 µM of Ca in the cultures with an initial Ca deficit (50 µM) shot up the growth rate. In non-ACC-forming cyanobacteria, the growth is barely affected by an initial Ca deficit. Hence, it has been suggested that a high Ca accumulation is essential for the growth of ACC-forming cyanobacteria (De Wever et al., 2019). Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether such high Ca uptake is necessary for certain biochemical processes or needed because ACC inclusions fulfill an important function in cyanobacteria. Several studies have postulated different hypotheses related to the biological functionality of ACC inclusions in cyanobacteria: (i) they may have a role linked with buoyancy, acting as ballast by increasing the cell density as an adaptation to benthic life (Couradeau et al., 2012; De Wever et al., 2019); (ii) they could constitute intracellular deposits where excess alkalinity produced during photosynthesis is stored rather than being transported extracellularly (Couradeau et al., 2012); (iii) they could serve as inorganic carbon deposits when its availability in the environment is limited (De Wever et al., 2019); (iv) they could buffer the intracellular pH (Couradeau et al., 2012; De Wever et al., 2019); (v) they could be related to cell division since the inclusions in Synechococcus sp. PCC 6312 appear in the septation site (Benzerara et al., 2014). In the newly discovered genus of Alphaproteobacteria, ACC inclusions represent an important increase of the cell density since they can occupy two-thirds of the cytoplasm. This may explain the gravitaxis observed in this type of organism, allowing cells to adjust their position at the bottom of the water column (Monteil et al., 2020). In the giant gammaproteobacterium Achromatium, the ACC inclusions could buffer the intracellular pH, avoiding important pH variations due to the redox transformations of S species (Yang et al., 2019; Benzerara et al., 2020). In Chlorodendrophyceae algae, micropearls may constitute Ca reserves that could have a biological role in theca and scales formation, flagella renewal, buoyancy, and motility Chapter II 
  45 (Martignier et al., 2020). In 1982, Ca-sequestering vesicles with diameters from 0.25 to 0.5 µm were detected in the anterior part of Tetraselmis subcordiformis by using calcium pyroantimonate and calcium oxalate cytochemistry, and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyses (Salisbury, 1982). The vesicles were suggested to rise free Ca2+ in the cytosol, triggering the contraction of the striated flagellar roots (contractile structures associated with the basal bodies of flagella that act as a “rudder”), and changing the swimming direction of the cells (Salisbury, 1982; Salisbury et al., 1984). The cellular location, size, and shape of the Ca-sequestering vesicles seem to match the characteristics of micropearls in Tetraselmis, as they are usually located in the anterior part of the cells and have an average length of 0.4 µm in T. subcordiformis (Martignier et al., 2018; Martignier et al., 2020).  2.7. Habitats ACC-forming microorganisms are varied and inhabit multiple different habitats. The existing studies suggest that they tend to colonize environments with dissolved Ca available (Tab. 1). The micropearls produced by T. cordiformis and the “Ba-organisms” were observed for the first time in Lake Geneva, where the surface water is oversaturated with calcite between April and August (Jaquet et al., 2013). However, most of the Chlorodendrophyceae strains studied have also been obtained from algae collections and cultured in diverse growth media (Martignier et al., 2018). Chlorodendrophyceae are widespread in the world and colonize different habitats, from freshwater (T. cordiformis, and Scherffelia dubia) to brackish water and seawater (T. chui, T. suecica, T. tetrathele, etc.). Lifestyles are also varied among the different strains: they can be found in the sediments (i.e. T. contracta) or the water column (i.e. S. dubia, T. chui, T. suecica, T. tetrathele, etc), as temporary sessile colonies or as free-swimming organisms (Martignier et al., 2018; Martignier et al., 2020). T. convolutae can also be found as a photoendosymbiont under the epidermis of the flatworm Symsagittifera roscoffensis (Selosse, 2000). Besides the two strains isolated from the alkaline Lake Alchichica (G. lithophora and Ca. S. calcipolaris), most of the cyanobacteria known today to form carbonate inclusions were obtained from culture collections (in particular, from the Pasteur Culture Collection of Chapter II 
  46 Cyanobacteria). The origin of the collected strains was very diverse: from German soils to rice fields in Senegal and hot springs in the USA and Japan (Benzerara et al., 2014). Interestingly, members of the G. lithophora and Ca. S. calcipolaris lineage have also been identified in microbialites of other Mexican lakes close to Lake Alchichica, as well as in karstic areas and microbial mats collected in South America and/or Southern Europe (Ragon et al., 2014). The undescribed genus of magnetotactic bacteria within the class Alphaproteobacteria and the giant sulfur bacteria Achromatium presenting ACC inclusions were both collected from the ferruginous and meromictic Lake Pavin (Monteil et al., 2020). The magnetotactic bacterium was collected from the sediments and the water column (Monteil et al., 2020), while Achromatium was collected from the sediments and the water overlaying them (Benzerara et al., 2020). In addition, unidentified cells containing ACC inclusions have also been observed in the oxic water of Lake Pavin (Miot et al., 2016) Study Location Date T (°C) pH Alkalinity (µM L-1) Mg (µM L-1) Ca (µM L-1) Sr (µM L-1) Ba (µM L-1) Saturation Index Calcite Jaquet et al.

The indicated values for Lake Geneva correspond to those obtained at 5 m depth, where micropearls were more abundant. Both environments present a basic pH and a similar saturation index (SI) of calcite based on the formula: SI=log (IAP/Ks). 2.8. Impact on the geochemical cycles  ACC-forming organisms, and especially those concentrating Ba and Sr, may have an unexpected impact on the geochemical cycle of AEM. For instance, an experiment in which the cyanobacterium G. lithophora is cultured in a growth medium supplemented with carbonate microbialite fragments (that act as a continuous source of Ca, Sr, and Ba in the medium) shows the capacity of this organism to buffer the dissolved Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios at low values (Blondeau et al., 2018a). Additionally, it has been proposed that Chapter II 
  47 the presence of microorganisms forming Ba-rich micropearls in Lake Geneva could have an impact on the geochemical cycle of Ba in this lake since an inverse correlation was observed between the number of “Ba-organisms” and the concentration of soluble Ba in the lake waters (Martignier et al., 2017).  Thus, these organisms have been suggested as plausible candidates for the development of new bioremediation techniques regarding Ba and radioactive 90Sr pollution (Cam et al., 2016; Martignier et al., 2017; Blondeau et al., 2018a; Martignier et al., 2018). The cyanobacterium G. lithophora has been shown to efficiently sequester 226Ra and 90Sr when these radionuclides were added to the culture medium (Mehta et al., 2019). Nevertheless, more in-depth studies are still needed to better understand the processes involved in the incorporation of these elements in order to critically assess any possible use of these organisms for bioremediation purposes. 2.9. Why have ACC inclusions only recently been observed? The ultrastructure of several strains of cyanobacteria known today to form ACC inclusions had been studied in the past but no description of the inclusions was published (Allen, 1984; Porta et al., 2000; Blondeau et al., 2018b). The same applies to Chlorodendrophyceae algae (Melkonian, 1979; Hori et al., 1982), commonly studied because of their interest in aquaculture (Gladue and Maxey, 1994; Meseck et al., 2005). Only some early microscopists had noticed the ACC inclusions as refractive inclusions, but none had described their chemical composition (Carter, 1937; Hollande et al., 1954; Butcher, 1959; Norris et al., 1980; Martignier et al., 2020). It has been noticed that ACC inclusions are translucent and very sensitive to pH variation. Therefore, they have probably been overlooked in optical microscope observations and dissolved during sample preparation for electron microscopy, in which chemical fixatives are normally used (Li et al., 2016; Martignier et al., 2017; Martignier et al., 2018; Schorn et al., 2020). ACC inclusions from Lake Alchichica and Lake Geneva were observed for the first time using SEM because the organisms were filtered and dried without using any chemical fixatives (Couradeau et al., 2012; Jaquet et al., 2013). The use of buffers (such as cacodylate buffer 2%) during the fixation process (Martignier et al., 2017) and the Chapter II 
  48 application of other techniques such as freeze-substitution and CEMOVIS (Blondeau et al., 2018b) also allow the preservation of ACC inclusions for SEM and TEM observation. Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy also allows the observation of the micropearls in living Chlorodendrophyceae algae (Martignier et al., 2020). ACC inclusions in Achromatium have been shown to be sensitive to strong laser irradiation (e.g., during Raman microspectroscopy analyses), which causes their spontaneous transformation into calcite (Benzerara et al., 2020). Thus, this may explain why the inclusions in Achromatium were commonly thought to be composed of calcite rather than ACC. Finally, the high instability and the amorphous character of the ACC inclusions may prevent their fossilization and therefore their observation in sediments is rather unlikely (Riding, 2012; Cam et al., 2018).  2.10. Evolutionary theories of ACC-forming organisms Cyanobacteria forming intracellular ACC inclusions are diverse and occupy distant positions in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting the existence of an early common ancestor presenting this biomineralization ability (Benzerara et al., 2014). This theory is reinforced by the presence of ACC inclusions in G. lithophora and T. elongatus BP-1, considered as deep-branching cyanobacteria (Couradeau et al., 2012; Benzerara et al., 2014). Moreover, all the known strains belonging to the T. elongatus BP-1 clade form intracellular ACC inclusions, showing that this biomineralization process can be heritable (Benzerara et al., 2014; Görgen et al., 2021). The idea of a common ancestor could also be valid regarding the two genera of microalgae within the Chlorodendrophyceae class (Tetraselmis and Scherffelia) since both genera form micropearls (Martignier et al., 2020). Adaptation to different ecological niches could have led to differentiation in the shape and distribution of micropearls between the Chlorodendrophyceae strains, influenced by the morphological changes of chloroplasts (Martignier et al., 2020). Analysis of the 5.8S/ITS2 and the rbcL sequences revealed the phylogenetic proximity of the strains sharing the same distribution pattern of micropearls, indicating that the micropearl arrangement could be used as a criterion to identify different phylogenetic groups within the class Chlorodendrophyceae (Martignier et al., 2020). Two main groups were set up according to the structure of the ITS2 helix. The first group was composed of all the Chapter II 
  49 Tetraselmis strains presenting four longitudinal alignments of micropearls in the apical pole of the cell, and the second one included Tetraselmis strains presenting other distribution patterns of micropearls together with the strains not forming micropearls (Fig. 5). The genus Scherffelia was defined as an outgroup even if it also presents a four-lobbed chloroplast, suggesting that Scherffelia is the oldest divergence in the class. The eukaryotic organisms forming intracellular Ba-rich ACC inclusions observed in Lake Geneva remain a mystery and not much can be said about their phylogenetical position. However, there are certain similarities between these organisms and the ciliates described by Fauré-Fremiet and Gauchery (1957), some of them presenting intracellular spherical granules of calcium carbonate that may be in an amorphous state associated with organic matter (e.g. Loxocephalus granulosus).  Concerning the magnetotactic bacteria collected from Lake Pavin, no other descriptions of ACC inclusions have been made within the class Alphaproteobacteria (Monteil et al., 2020). Nonetheless, two strains of magnetotactic bacteria within the class Gammaproteobacteria have been reported to possess Ca-rich inclusions: (i) the giant rod-shaped magnetotactic bacterium GRS-1 (Taoka et al., 2014) and (ii) a magnetotactic bacterium obtained from the Seine River (France) (Isambert et al., 2007). Nevertheless, it is still yet unknown whether these inclusions are in an amorphous phase or not (Monteil et al., 2020). The anoxic sulfur bacterium Achromatium is the only genus included in the class Gammaproteobacteria that is known to date to form intracellular ACC inclusions (Benzerara    Chapter II 
  50 2020). Therefore, it is challenging to know whether or not these groups of bacteria are related by a common ancestor able to form intracellular calcium carbonate inclusions.

In brief, the newly discovered biomineralization process involved in the formation of intracellular ACC inclusions seems to be similar in all the groups of microorganisms producing them. However, these groups are probably too distant in the phylogenic tree to consider an evolutionary link between all of them. Therefore, the intracellular biomineralization phenomenon of ACC has probably appeared in such different groups of organisms due to a convergent evolution (independent evolution resulting in common features), relying on different molecular processes. Then, this biomineralization capacity may have been subsequently transmitted to species included in the same clade through a common ancestor. For instance, this could explain why ACC inclusions in microalgae have only been observed in the class Chlorodendrophyceae, and why some differences in the shape and distribution patterns of micropearls have been noticed between species, as a result of adaptation to different environments (divergent evolution) (Martignier et al., 2020). However, further phylogenetic analyses still need to be carried out to clarify any possible evolutionary relationship of all these organisms. 2.11. The way ahead Future research efforts to describe the biomineralization processes leading to the formation of intracellular ACC inclusions in microorganisms are needed to answer unresolved questions. In-depth analyses of the variations in the chemical composition of the media where the ACC-forming microorganisms are cultured will provide additional information on the AEM uptake kinetics and their impact on the geochemical cycles. Moreover, additional experiments involving cultures with added 90Sr remain crucial to investigate the feasibility of using ACC-forming microorganisms for the development of new bioremediation methods. Further comparative genomic analyses are necessary to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation and stabilization of the ACC inclusions. Experiments involving isotope labeling could also provide insight into the cellular pathways related to their formation. In addition, the detection of culture conditions affecting the formation of the ACC inclusions could shed light on their Chapter II 
  52 biological role. Finally, future molecular phylogenetic studies are essential to understand the origin of these processes and their diversification among microorganisms. 2.12. Conclusions Originally, the biomineralization of calcium carbonate was mainly thought to be an extracellular process in microorganisms; however, recent studies have shown that the formation of intracellular ACC inclusions is a widespread phenomenon in both prokaryote and eukaryote unicellular organisms. These inclusions can be observed using SEM and TEM, with an appropriate preparation and DIC optical microscopy for living organisms. Many of the organisms possessing this newly discovered biomineralization capacity can concentrate Ba and/or Sr and may thus have an impact on the geochemical cycle of AEM. This peculiar feature makes these microorganisms to be considered interesting candidates to develop new bioremediation technologies regarding Ba and radioactive 90Sr pollution, also because they can be found in very different living environments. The biological functionality of the ACC inclusions, as well as the molecular processes involved in their formation, are not clear yet and require more in-depth research. The occurrence of intracellular ACC inclusions in phylogenetically distant groups of microorganisms suggests an independent evolution leading to similar biomineralization processes. 2.13.

 58 3.1. Abstract Strontium-rich micropearls (intracellular inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate) have been observed in several species of green microalgae within the class Chlorodendrophyceae, suggesting the potential use of these organisms for 90Sr bioremediation purposes. However, very little is known about the micropearl formation process and the Ca and Sr uptake dynamics of these microalgae. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigated, through laboratory cultures, the behavior of two species within the class Chorodendrophyceae: Tetraselmis chui, forming micropearls, and T. marina, not forming micropearls. We show that T. chui growth and micropearl formation requires available Ca in the culture medium, and that the addition of dissolved Sr can partially replace the function of Ca in cells. On the other hand, T. marina can grow without added Ca and Sr, probably due to its inability to form micropearls. T. chui cells show a high Ca and Sr uptake, significantly decreasing the concentration of both elements in the culture medium. Strontium is incorporated in micropearls in a short period of time, suggesting that micropearl formation is, most likely, a fast process that only takes a few hours. In addition, we show that micropearls equally distribute between daughter cells during cell division. 3.2. Introduction Chlorodendrophyceae are a class of green microalgae widespread in aquatic environments including seawater, freshwater, and brackish water (Norris et al., 1980). This class is composed of two genera: Scherffelia and Tetraselmis (Guiry and Guiry, 2021), the latter commonly used as a feed in aquaculture to support the growth of bivalve mollusks (Meseck et al., 2005). Over the last decade, the combination of electron microscopy with adapted sample preparation methods has revealed the formation of intracellular inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) in most of the species within this class (Martignier et al., 2018; Martignier et al., 2020; Segovia-Campos et al., 2021). These mineral inclusions are called micropearls and their distribution, shape, and number per cell vary according to the chloroplast morphology of the species and their habitat (Martignier et al., 2020). The differences among species coincide with the Chapter III  
 59 5.8/ITS2- and rbcL-based phylogenetic trees, making micropearls a valid criterion to distinguish the different clades within the class Chlorodendrophyceae. ACC is the most unstable calcium carbonate polymorph, being relatively soluble in its pure state (Addadi et al., 2003). Micropearls ACC can contain a high percentage of Sr compared to the chemical composition of the extracellular medium (Martignier et al., 2018). This finding suggests that Chlorodendrophyceae have the ability to selectively concentrate Sr (Martignier et al., 2018; Segovia-Campos et al., 2021), being of potential interest to develop new strategies to efficiently remediate 90Sr, which is a major radioactive pollutant released into the environment in the event of a nuclear accident (Vakulovsky et al., 1994). In the past years, similar mineral inclusions have also been reported in very diverse microorganisms, including both prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes (protists) (Segovia-Campos et al., 2021). For instance, some cyanobacteria such as Gloeomargarita lithophora and Candidatus Synecococcus calcipolaris form ACC inclusions in which Ba and Sr are preferentially accumulated over Ca (Cam et al., 2016). Non-identified protists from Lake Geneva (France, Switzerland) also present ACC inclusions highly enriched in Sr and Ba (Martignier et al., 2017). However, high concentrations of Ba have never been detected in Chlorodendrophyceae micropearls. The discovery of these intracellular Sr and/or Ba-enriched ACC inclusions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms is of great interest as it shows that the intracellular biomineralization of calcium carbonate is more widespread than previously thought. Indeed, the biogenic formation of calcium carbonate in microorganisms has commonly been considered an extracellular process, the description of intracellular calcium carbonates being rare in the past. Only a few microorganisms were known to form intracellular calcium carbonates: coccolithophores (Brownlee et al., 2015), the giant sulfur bacterium Achromatium (Head et al., 2000; Gray, 2006), and some aquatic ciliates (Fauré-Fremiet and Gauchery, 1957).  Several studies have attempted to identify the physiological function of the intracellular inclusions of ACC in microorganisms and the molecular mechanisms behind their formation and stabilization. It has been suggested that the ACC mineral inclusions in cyanobacteria could (i) have a role in the regulation of intracellular pH and alkalinity Chapter III  
 60 (Couradeau et al., 2012; De Wever et al., 2019), (ii) act as ballast by increasing cell density to adapt the position of these microorganisms in the water column (Couradeau et al., 2012; De Wever et al., 2019), (iii) constitute carbon reserves (De Wever et al., 2019), and/or (iv) be involved in cell division (Benzerara et al., 2014). In the green microalgae within the class Chlorodendrophyceae, micropearls have been suggested to constitute Ca deposits that could be linked to the formation of the flagella and theca, as well as to the motility and buoyancy of the cells (Martignier et al., 2020). However, there is no evidence supporting these hypotheses and further research is needed to determine the real function of micropearls.  Some studies have investigated the possible impact of microorganisms forming intracellular ACC inclusions on the geochemical cycles of alkaline earth metals. The cyanobacterium G. lithophora has been shown to significantly impact the geochemical cycles of Ba and Sr in laboratory experiments in which batch cultures were supplemented with a continuous supply of alkaline earth metals by microbialite dissolution (Blondeau et al., 2018a). In the case of Chlorodendrophyceae microalgae, a few studies previous to the discovery of micropearls already pointed out high Sr concentrations in the cell content of some Tetraselmis species (Mei et al., 2006; Ulloa et al., 2012). It has been hypothesized that the formation of micropearls in Chlorodendrophyceae requires high Ca and Sr uptake by these organisms, which may alter the chemical composition of the extracellular medium (Martignier et al., 2017). However, again, this has never been experimentally proven.  In this study, we explore for the first time the micropearl formation process in Chlorodendrophyceae under controlled conditions. For this purpose, we compared the behavior under different culture conditions of two seawater species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae: Tetraselmis chui, forming micropearls, and Tetraselmis marina, not forming micropearls. We follow (i) the effect of dissolved Ca and Sr concentrations on cell growth and micropearl formation, (ii) the location and distribution of micropearls during cell division, and (iii) the Ca and Sr uptake kinetics by Chlorodendrophyceae and their impact on the chemical composition of the culture medium. Micropearl formation was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS), while cation uptake was mainly followed by Chapter III  
 61 simultaneous measurement of their concentrations in cells and culture media using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS).  3.3. Methods 3.3.1. Origin, selection, and characteristics of the studied strains Tetraselmis chui (8-6) and Tetraselmis marina (202.80) strains were both obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Göttingen (SAG) (Supplementary Information Tab. S2). T. chui was chosen to study micropearl formation as its growth is relatively fast and its micropearl distribution pattern the most commonly observed within the class Chlorodendrophyceae. T. marina was selected for this study as it is one of the few Chlorodendrophyceae species that do not form micropearls, allowing direct comparison between a micropearl-forming and a non-micropearl-forming species within the same genus.  3.3.2. Culture conditions  ASP-H medium (Littler et al., 1979) modified by McFadden and Melkonian (1986) was prepared without added Ca at pH 8.3 and autoclaved (Supplementary Information Tab. S3). Filtered SrCl2·6H2O and CaCl2·2H2O stock solutions were subsequently added to obtain culture media with different Ca and Sr concentrations. To test Ca and Sr uptake capacities of T. chui and T. marina, as well as their behavior under different culture conditions, both strains were separately inoculated in 400 mL of the different culture media at a cell density of ~104 cell mL-1. The cultures were set in triplicates using 2-L Erlenmeyer flasks and placed in an incubator (Multitron Standard- Infors HT) during 360 h (15 days) at 20 °C, 110 rpm shaking, and a 14:10 light-dark cycle with 400 lux light intensity. Non-inoculated media were placed under the same growth conditions as controls. All precultures were grown in a culture medium with 2.5 mM Ca, which is the standard Ca concentration of ASP-H modified medium. For some of the experiments presented in this study, we also cultured the algae with lower and higher Ca concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 4, and 16 mM) in order to investigate the optimal Ca concentrations for cell growth and micropearl formation. Depending on the experiment Chapter III  
 62 performed, the Sr concentrations added to the culture medium were 0, 0.1, and 0.5 mM. The concentration of 0.1 mM corresponds to the natural Sr concentration in seawater (Luther III, 2016), while 0.5 mM Sr was the chosen concentration to investigate the effect of a higher (but environmentally plausible) Sr concentration on the algae behavior. 3.3.3. Sampling Fifty-two-mL samples of the microalgae cultures were collected every 72 h. From this volume, 1 mL was used to measure the cell concentration of the cultures, 200 µL to prepare SEM samples, and 50 mL for chemical analysis by ICP-MS. In order to follow the incorporation of Sr in micropearls using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), we also sampled 200 µL of the cultures enriched with 0.5 mM Sr after 1, 3, 5, 9, 12, and 24 h from the Sr addition. 3.3.4. Cell concentration measurements Cell concentration in liquid cultures was estimated by measuring their optical density at 680 nm, using a spectrophotometer (WPA, Biowave). For each species, a correlation between optical density and cell density was previously established after cell counting in a Neubauer chamber. 3.3.5. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) sample preparation, observation, and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis Samples for SEM observation were prepared by filtering 200 µL of the liquid cultures with a 1-2-µm pore size polycarbonate membrane (Whatman® NucleporeTM). During filtration, a weak vacuum pressure was applied to avoid cell deformation and breakage. The membrane was then placed on an Al stub with a double-sided carbon tape and coated with a thin layer of Au (10 nm) by low vacuum pressure sputtering.  Sample observation and imaging were performed with a JEOL JSM 7001F Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with an EDXS detector (model EX-94300S4L1Q, JEOL) for semi-quantitative analysis. Samples were observed and imaged using the backscattered electron detection mode. EDXS measurements were acquired with a beam current of 7 Chapter III  
 63 nA, 15 kV accelerating voltage, and an acquisition time of 30 seconds. Semi-quantitative data was obtained by applying the ZAF correction. Results are given as mol%. Micropearls Sr/Ca mol% ratios measurements in T. chui samples were performed in at least 25 micropearls (randomly selected). The obtained values were then used to calculate the average Sr/Ca mol% ratios and the standard deviation of each dataset. Micropearls length measurements were performed using the software ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). We compared the micropearls length of T. chui cells grown with 2.5 mM Ca and different Sr concentrations: 0 mM (n=105), 0.1 mM (n=44), and 0.5 mM (n=46), by performing a Tukey HSD statistical test using the Vassar Statistics web server (Lowry, 2015). We previously applied the Shapiro-Wilk statistical test to confirm the normal distribution of the samples using the software GraphPad Prism 8 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA).   3.3.6. Calcium and strontium concentration measurements For chemical analysis, 50-mL samples of T. chui and T. marina cultures were centrifuged in 50-mL sterile polypropylene tubes (Falcon®) at 4000 rpm during 5 min (Sorvall Legend X1R, Thermo Scientific). Five mL of the supernatants (corresponding to the culture media) were then stored in 15 mL sterile polypropylene tubes (Falcon®) at -80 °C for further analyses. The rest was discarded. Algae pellets were transferred to 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes® and rinsed three times with 1 mL of a solution containing Milli-Q® water, 0.1 M NaCl, and 2 mM HEPES (adjusted at pH 8.3). After each rinse, the tubes were centrifuged for 1 min at 4000 rpm (Eppendorf minispin pro) and supernatants discarded. Washed algae pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried (Alpha 2-4, Christ) for 24 h. Ten mg of each sample of lyophilized algal cells were accurately weighted using a microbalance (XPR 26, Mettler-Toledo) and placed in 4 mL borosilicate tubes (Wheaton®) with 256 µL 65-67% HNO3 (Normaton) and 64 µL 30% H2O2 (Supelco) to carry out microwave-assisted acidic digestions (Multiwave Pro Solv, Anton Paar). Four samples of Certified Reference Material (CRM) No. 3 Chlorella (National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan) were prepared following the same procedure to test the effectiveness of the digestion. Rotor 64MG5 was loaded with samples, CRM, and blanks (65-67% Chapter III  
 64 HNO3/30% H2O2 = 4:1). The digestion program applied was: (i) 15 min ramp to reach 150 W, (ii) hold 15 min at 150 W, (iii) 20 min ramp to reach 300 W, (iv) hold 30 min at 300 W. The IR-limit was set at 140 °C. Digested algae samples and blanks were first diluted 50 times in Milli-Q® water, and then diluted a second time with 2% HNO3 to obtain a final dilution factor of 1500 in a 2% HNO3 matrix. To obtain good Ca and Sr detection levels, CRM digested solutions were diluted only 50 times in Milli-Q® water. Culture media samples were thawed at room temperature and diluted 80 times in 2% HNO3. The CRM Sea Water (High-purity standards) was diluted following the same process. Calibration solutions were prepared with Ca and Sr reference solutions that were diluted in 2% HNO3. Quality controls (QC) used during the analyses of the digested algae samples were prepared using a 2% HNO3 matrix spiked with different volumes of Ca and Sr standard solutions. QC solutions used for the analyses of the culture media were prepared with a matrix containing non-inoculated ASP-H modified medium (without Ca and Sr) that was diluted 80 times in 2% HNO3 and was spiked with different concentrations of Ca and Sr. Before running the analyses, all the solutions were filtered with 0.5-µm pore size polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) filters (Puradisc). Isotopes 43Ca, 44Ca, 87Sr, and 88Sr were measured in all the samples using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (7700x, Agilent Technologies) in No Gaz, Helium, and High Energy Helium modes. The ICP-MS was coupled to an ASX-500 Series autosampler (Agilent Technologies). A solution containing 50 µg L-1 of both Re and Rh was employed as an internal standard to detect and correct any plasma fluctuations. Calcium and Sr calibrations were performed separately to detect and correct any Sr interference in Ca measurements.  Analyses of CRM and QC samples provided satisfactory results: accuracies for both Ca and Sr concentrations ranged between 90 and 110% with a degree of precision (RSD) below 10%. Instrumental detection limits (3 x blank standard deviation) for Ca and Sr measurements were 2.9 and 0.06 µg L-1, respectively. 3.3.7. Calculation of calcium and strontium uptake rates  Calcium and Sr uptake rates, UR, were calculated as Cam et al. (2016): Chapter III  
 65 𝑈𝑅!=[X]"−[X]!𝐶𝐷****"!𝑡!−	𝑡"	 where t is time (in h), i and j two successive measurement times, [X] the concentration of the element X (in fmol) in the culture medium, 𝐶𝐷**** the average cell density between times i and j (in cell L-1).  3.4. Results  3.4.1. Effect of the initial calcium and strontium concentration on T. chui and T. marina growth  To test if low Ca concentrations in the culture medium have a higher impact on T. chui (micropearl-producer) growth than on T. marina (non-micropearl-producer), we followed the growth of both species in ASP-H medium with different initial Ca concentrations in the medium. The growth of T. chui was strongly limited by low Ca concentrations in the medium compared to T. marina (Fig.1A, B). Indeed, T. chui cells were barely dividing in a culture enriched with 0.1 mM Ca. However, the addition of 0.5 and 2.5 mM Sr to the media allowed T. chui cell growth (Fig. 1C).  To understand if Ca and Sr have a similar effect on T. chui growth, we also followed its development in ASP-H medium with different initial concentrations of dissolved Ca and Sr. In T. chui cultures without added Ca, the addition of Sr was not enough to trigger cell division (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, T. chui cultures with 2.5 and 0.1 mM added Ca and Sr, respectively, showed a higher cell production than cultures in which these concentrations were switched (0.1 mM Ca and 2.5 mM Sr). Similar observations were made when the cell growth of T. chui cultures enriched with 0.5 mM Ca and 0.1 mM Sr was compared to that of cultures in which these concentrations were reversed (Fig. 1C). 3.4.2. Micropearls presence and composition To investigate if the availability of Ca and Sr in the culture medium can affect the micropearl formation process, we followed the formation of micropearls in T. chui cells cultured with different concentrations of both elements. SEM observation of T. chui cells Chapter III  
 66 cultured in ASP-H medium enriched with 0.1 mM Ca showed that micropearls were absent under these culture conditions (Fig. 1D). However, the addition of 0.5 and 2.5 mM Sr resulted in the formation of Sr-rich micropearls (Fig. 1E-H). A concentration of 0.5 mM dissolved Ca in T. chui cultures was also enough to trigger micropearl formation (Supplementary Information Fig. S1). T. marina cells were also observed under the same culture conditions, and they did not form micropearls in any case (Supplementary Information Fig. S2).   EDXS analyses showed that Sr/Ca mol% ratios were rapidly established in T. chui micropearls after cell inoculation in a culture medium containing dissolved Ca and Sr, and did not vary after 72 h of growth (Supplementary Information Fig. S3). Indeed, T. chui cells grown in cultures enhanced with 2.5 mM Ca and spiked with 0.5 mM Sr during the exponential growth stage already contained Sr-rich micropearls 9 h after the Sr addition, being the Sr accumulation higher in the smaller micropearls mainly located in the center of the cells (Fig. 2). Finally, T. chui cells cultured with 2.5 mM Ca and 0.1 mM Sr showed the highest Sr/Ca mol% ratios in micropearls compared to the element ratio in the culture medium. Under these culture conditions, the average Sr/Ca mol% ratio measured in micropearls from T. chui cultures older than 72 h was 12.4 (± 1.2) times higher than the ratio measured in the culture medium. This enrichment factor remained constant over time since not significant variations were observed (Fig. 3A). In T. chui cultures enriched with 2.5 mM Ca and 0.5 mM Sr, the micropearls Sr/Ca mol% ratio was, on average, 2.5 (± 0.9) times higher than the measured Sr/Ca mol% ratio in the culture medium. This value also remained constant over time (Fig. 3A). Micropearls Sr/Ca mol% ratios of T. chui cultures enhanced with 0.1 mM Ca and 2.5 mM Sr, as well as with 0.1 mM Ca and 0.5 mM Sr, presented lower enrichment values (Supplementary Information Tab. S1). T. chui cells produced micropearls 10% larger when Sr was added to the cultures, compared to micropearls observed in T. chui cultures only enhanced with Ca (Fig. 3B). SEM observation of dividing T. chui cells showed an equal distribution of micropearls between the daughter cells, each new cell receiving a similar number of micropearls (Fig. 4). However, the spatial organization of micropearls was highly variable during cell division: micropearls could be scattered throughout the cytoplasm, distributed along the dividing line, or located in the cell poles.

Strontium bioaccumulation factors were calculated by dividing the Sr/Ca mol % ratio of micropearls (EDXS measurements) by the Sr/Ca mol % ratio of the culture medium (ICP-MS measurements). (B) Tukey boxplot summarizing micropearl length measured in T. chui cells obtained from 288-h-old cultures enriched with different Sr initial concentrations. Data set includes length values of 105 micropearls of cultures enhanced with 2.5 mM Ca, 44 micropearls of cultures enhanced with 2.5 mM Ca and 0.1 mM Sr, and 46 micropearls of cultures enhanced with 2.5 mM Ca and 0.5 mM Sr. The bold lines indicate the median values, the bottom and top of the boxes span the second and third quartile, and the whiskers span 1.5 times the extend of the boxes. Open circles are outliers. The average of the length values and standard deviations (SD) are indicated for each boxplot.  The Tukey HSD statistical test shows a significant (p<0.01 (**)) difference between cultures without Sr and cultures enhanced with this element. In addition, a less significant difference (p<0.05(*)) is shown between the cultures enriched with 0.1 and 0.5 mM Sr.   3.4.3. Kinetics of calcium and strontium uptake We compared the Ca and Sr uptake capacities of T. marina and T. chui cells cultured with 2.5 mM Ca (standard Ca concentration of ASP-H medium) and different Sr concentrations in order to test if high Ca and Sr absorption capacities are specific to micropearl forming species. By testing different Sr concentrations, we also investigated the best conditions 
Chapter III  
 70 for optimal absorption rates. In both species, cell growth was not altered by the different Sr additions in the culture media (Supplementary Information Fig. S4). In T. marina cultures and in non-inoculated controls, the concentrations of dissolved Ca and Sr remained relatively constant over time (Fig. 5A-E). However, the concentrations of dissolved Ca and Sr in T. chui cultures significantly decreased after 72 h of growth, reaching half of their initial concentration of both elements after 144 to 216 h (Fig. 5A-E), followed by a slight increase of the concentration of both dissolved elements during the stationary growth stage.  T. chui cells showed maximum absorption rates of both Ca and Sr after 72 h of culture, corresponding to the exponential growth phase of the algal cells (Supplementary Information Fig. S5). In all cultures, Ca and Sr uptake rates decreased over the duration of the culture, reaching values close to 0 fmol cell-1 h-1 after 216 h. The highest Ca uptake rate was observed in T. chui cultures in which Sr was not added, reaching an absorption rate of 50.2 (± 15.2) fmol cell-1 h-1. Maximum Sr absorption rates (8.9 ± 3.9 fmol cell-1 h-1) were observed in T. chui cultures enhanced with 0.5 mM Sr, which is the highest concentration tested in this experiment. However, Ca uptake rate of T. chui cells cultured with 0.5 mM dissolved Sr was the lowest observed during the first hours of growth (22.2 ± 8.2 fmol cell-1 h-1). Indeed, we observed that Ca uptake rate in T. chui cells slowed down as Sr was added to the cultures.  Analysis of the cell content showed that Ca cellular concentrations were already stable in both species at t=0 since all precultures had been enhanced with 2.5 mM Ca (Fig. 5F-I). Calcium concentrations in the cells within the same species were similar in the different cultures, not being affected by the addition of Sr. The Ca concentration measured in T. chui cells reached values above 20 mg g-1 (Fig. 5H), while the Ca concentration in T. marina cells was, on average, 67 times lower (Fig. 5F). The Sr cell content was already stable in both species after 72 h. The highest Sr concentration measured in T. chui cells was 16.7 mg g-1 (Fig. 5I) vs 0.04 mg g-1 measured in T. marina cells (Fig. 5G), both grown in cultures enhanced with 0.5 mM Sr.    Chapter III

Calcium and strontium high uptake by T. chui cells is related to micropearl formation and cell growth A relationship exists between the availability of Ca and Sr in the medium, the formation of micropearls, and the cell growth of T. chui. At low concentrations of dissolved Ca (0.1 mM) and absence of Sr, micropearls are absent in T. chui cells and cell growth is strongly limited compared to that of T. marina cultures, where micropearls have never been detected regardless of culture conditions. Interestingly, a similar Ca-dependence has been previously noticed in some cyanobacteria forming intracellular ACC inclusions (De Wever et al., 2019). On the other hand, the addition of Sr in T. chui cultures with low initial dissolved Ca concentrations triggers the formation of micropearls (extremely rich in Sr) and cell growth. It is well known that Ca and Sr have similar chemical properties, and several studies have shown that Sr can substitute Ca in many functional processes in diverse organisms (Walker, 1953; Miledi, 1966; Kylin and Das, 1967). However, the growth rate of T. chui cultures in which Ca has been primarily replaced by Sr is slower than that of cultures where Ca has not been replaced. In addition, when Ca is totally absent, the presence of Sr is not enough to trigger micropearl formation and cell growth. Therefore, we can deduce that: (i) T. chui (and probably all micropearl-forming species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae) only grows in environments where Ca is available. (ii) Micropearl formation and cell growth are dependent processes. (iii) When Ca is available at low concentrations in the cultures, Sr can partially replace the Ca function by promoting micropearl formation and cell growth. Nevertheless, the ability of micropearl-forming Chlorodendrophyceae to selectively concentrate Sr over Ca, might suggest that Sr itself has a role in the cells. Interestingly, the maximum Sr concentration capacity of T. chui occurs in cultures with Sr concentrations similar to those of seawater (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Information Tab. S1). Several studies have shown that the lack of available Sr can affect CaCO3 biomineralization in some organisms. For instance, in the opisthobranch gastropod Chapter III  
 74 Aplysia californica, embryos cultured in artificial seawater without Sr show deformed shells and statocysts lacking the statolith (Bidwell et al., 1986). In addition, the absence of Sr also affects the development of statoliths in hatchling cephalopods as well as the formation of the cuttlefish bone, indicating a possible significant role of Sr in carbonate biomineralization (Hanlon et al., 1989). Although Sr does not seem to play an essential role in the biomineralization of micropearls in T. chui cells, micropearls are 10% smaller when Sr is absent in the culture media compared to micropearls of cultures enhanced with 0.1 and 0.5 mM Sr (Fig. 3B). This size difference is probably directly related to the Sr covalent radius being ~10 % larger than that of Ca. 3.5.2. Micropearl formation process Thien et al. (2017) estimated the formation and growth of micropearls to be a process lasting between 14 h and 72 days, depending on the ambient temperature and the alkaline earth metal concentrations in the micropearls. Here, we found that Sr is incorporated in the micropearls in about 9 h and that Ca and Sr are mainly absorbed during the exponential growth stage of the algal cells, indicating that the uptake of these elements and the formation of micropearls occurs shortly after cell division. Hence, micropearl formation rather occurs on a time scale of a few hours. We have also observed that micropearls are equally distributed among the daughter cells as previously shown in cyanobacteria forming ACC inclusions (Li et al., 2016). To maintain a certain number of micropearls per cell after cell division, it seems reasonable to assume that the new micropearls will form rapidly. Indeed, after the addition of 0.5 mM Sr in T. chui cultures during the exponential growth stage, small inclusions highly enriched in Sr (compared to those located in the anterior part of the cells) are observed in the central zone of the cells, probably due to their recent formation compared to the larger micropearls situated in the anterior pole that are possibly older (Fig. 2). This observation suggests that micropearls begin to form first in the central part of the cells and that, as they grow, they are transported to the anterior part of the cells. It is not yet known how the inclusions move inside cells, however clear changes in the distribution pattern of intracellular inclusions have been observed over time in other species such as T. contracta (Martignier et al., 2020). In addition, the fact that micropearls are not randomly segregated among Chapter III  
 75 the daughter cells during cell division indicates that their location is actively controlled by the cell and can be relocated. In cyanobacteria forming intracellular ACC inclusions, it has been postulated that the spatial organization of the inclusions within the cells may involve cytoskeletal proteins (Benzerara et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016).  It is well known that ACC formation takes place in highly supersaturated solutions (Aizenberg et al., 1996; Loste et al., 2003; Weiner and Dove, 2003). For that to occur, ions are transported to a specific cell location against concentration gradients (from unsaturated to saturated environments) (Mann, 2001). In cyanobacteria and other prokaryotic organisms forming intracellular ACC inclusions, the formation of the mineral inclusions has been shown to occur in intracellular compartments where saturation levels are probably regulated by transport proteins that actively control Ca, Sr, Ba, and carbonates import (Blondeau et al., 2018b; Monteil et al., 2020). Most likely, similar structures envelope micropearls in Chlorodendrophyceae microalgae, although this has not been proven yet. If so, Ca entry in the intracellular compartments could, for instance, involve Ca2+/H+ antiporters similar to those believed to occur in the membranes of coccolith vesicles of coccolithophorid algae, where calcite scales (coccoliths) are formed (Brownlee et al., 2020). In cyanobacteria forming ACC inclusions, at least one gene coding for this type of antiporters has been identified (De Wever et al., 2019). Recently, a new gene family encoding calcyanin proteins has been identified in cyanobacteria forming intracellular ACC inclusions, being possibly involved in Ca homeostasis and ACC formation (Benzerara et al., 2022). However, the specific function of these proteins is still not clear. Regarding Sr, it has been shown that many plants incorporate this element following Ca uptake pathways since they are not able to discriminate between these two elements (Watanabe et al., 2007; Drouet and Herbauts, 2008; Jovanović et al., 2021). However, we do not know yet if the import pathways of Sr to the nucleation sites are the same as those of Ca, or if other transport systems presenting high affinities for Sr are involved. Nevertheless, the fact that the Sr/Ca ratio is higher in the micropearls than in the culture media containing low Sr concentrations suggests that the Sr transport to the nucleation site is a selective process. Although such Sr-transport systems have never been described before, they must also exist in organisms such as the planktonic unicellular eukaryotes Acantharia, presenting a skeleton made of SrSO4 (Decelle and Not, 2015), or the brown Chapter III  
 76 alga Cystoseira barbata, able to specifically concentrate Sr over Ca (Tashmukhamedov et al., 1983). We also observed that the addition of dissolved Sr in T. chui cultures slowed down the Ca uptake rate of this organism during the first 72 h, suggesting a possible Ca and Sr competition for the binding site of transporter proteins that could be located in the cell membrane. Finally, carbonates could enter in the intracellular compartments as HCO3- and further dissociate in CO32- and H+. The latter being subsequently exported by the Ca2+/H+ antiporter systems, allowing to maintain a high alkalinity and basic pH within the compartments, both critical conditions for carbonate precipitation (Cam et al., 2015). Results of ongoing genomic analyses will be essential to decipher the molecular processes involved in the transport of these elements to the biomineralization site. 3.5.3. Impact of T. chui on the chemical composition of the extracellular medium Previous studies have detected very strong Ca, Sr, and Ba uptake capacities in several cyanobacteria strains forming intracellular ACC inclusions (Cam et al., 2016; Blondeau et al., 2018a; De Wever et al., 2019). The maximal Ca and Sr uptake rates of the cyanobacterium G. lithophora, which has been suggested to significantly impact the geochemical cycles of alkaline earth metals, were estimated at 0.05 and 0.07 fmol h-1 cell-1, respectively (Cam et al., 2016). Here, the maximum Ca and Sr uptake rates of T. chui are respectively estimated to be 50.2 and 8.86 fmol h-1 cell-1. These values cannot be directly compared with those of G. lithophora because differences in cell size must be considered in order to make valid comparisons between organisms. The total Ca mass in T. chui cells could represent more than 2% of the total cell dry mass, which is a similar Ca accumulation capacity to that measured in G. lithophora and other cyanobacteria forming ACC inclusions such as T. elongatus or Cyanothece sp. (2-4%) (Cam et al., 2016; De Wever et al., 2019). This result is consistent with previously published studies analyzing the mineral composition of T. chui (Barat Baviera et al., 2013; Tibbetts et al., 2015). On the other hand, T. marina cells only accumulated an average of 0.03% of Ca in mass and, therefore, the concentration of dissolved Ca in the cultures of this species did not significantly vary over time. This large difference between T. chui and T. marina uptake capacities is most likely due to the absence of micropearls in T. marina cells, which means Chapter III  
 77 that most of the Ca measured in T. chui is stored in the micropearls. The total Sr mass in T. chui reached a maximum of 1.7% of the total cell dry mass, which is four times lower than that measured in G. lithophora cells (although it must be considered that the growing conditions were different in each case). Still, the Sr absorbing capacity of T. chui is greater than that of T. marina (0.001% of the total dry mass) and other microalgae species not known to form ACC intracellular inclusions (Tab. 1), suggesting that most of the Sr measured in T. chui cells is also accumulated in the micropearls. Our results are consistent with SEM-EDXS analyses, showing high Sr concentrations in the micropearls of T. chui. These observations suggest a possible impact of Chlorodendrophyceae species forming micropearls on the geochemical cycles of Ca and Sr. However, further research is needed to determine the degree of influence of these microorganisms on both Ca and Sr global cycles, considering the dynamics and circulation of these elements, as well as the natural occurrence of Chlorodendrophyceae in aquatic environments. Finally, it is important to note that, after cell death in Ca and Sr unsaturated aquatic environments, micropearls are expected to rapidly dissolve because of their amorphous character (Riding, 2012; Cam et al., 2018; Segovia-Campos et al., 2021). This could explain the slight increase of dissolved Ca and Sr during the last hours of growth in some T. chui cultures.     Chapter III

Conclusions The present study evidences a high Ca and Sr uptake by T. chui cells that is related to micropearl formation and cell growth. This high uptake has not been observed in the non-micropearl-forming species T. marina, its growth not being strongly affected by low dissolved Ca and Sr concentrations in the cultures.  Available Ca is essential for both T. chui cell growth and micropearl formation. However, when this element is not available in sufficient concentrations, the addition of dissolved Sr to the cultures can partially replace Ca function by triggering Sr-rich micropearl formation and restoring cell division.  Although Sr does not appear to be crucial for micropearl formation when Ca is available in T. chui cultures, Sr is specifically accumulated in micropearls in less than 9 h. Indeed, Sr/Ca mol% ratio in these mineral inclusions can be up to 10 times higher than in the Chapter III  
 79 culture media. The reason why T. chui cells accumulate Sr in micropearls is not clear yet and further research is needed.  During cell division, micropearls location in T. chui cells is strongly controlled, leading to their equal distribution between the daughter cells. The high Ca and Sr accumulation rates observed during the exponential phase of T. chui growth, as well as the rapid incorporation of Sr in micropearls, suggest that new micropearls are formed rapidly after cell division. Their formation seems to start in the central zone of the cells and as they grow, they are displaced to the anterior pole of the cells.  Finally, it has been shown that Sr uptake by T. chui cells is much higher than that of microalgae that do not form micropearls. T. chui cells significantly decreased Sr concentrations in the culture media, supporting the idea of using micropearl-forming Chlorodendrophyceae species as potential candidates to develop new remediation techniques to treat radioactive 90Sr contamination (Vakulovsky et al., 1994; Møller and Mousseau, 2006; Pathak and Gupta, 2020). Alternatively, micropearl-forming Chlorodendrophyceae could be used to reduce natural Sr levels in drinking water (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2004; Health Canada, 2019). Ongoing studies will be crucial to assess the suitability of these organisms for these bioremediation purposes. 3.7.

 88 4.1.  Abstract The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of micropearls in the class of green microalgae Chlorodendrophyceae are not yet well-understood, as this phenomenon had never been investigated through genomic and transcriptomic studies. In this study, the complete genome and transcriptome of Tetraselmis chui have been sequenced and a differential RNA expression study has been performed with T. chui cultures grown under unfavorable and favorable conditions for micropearl formation. T. chui genome and transcriptome were obtained using PacBio and Illumina sequencing, respectively. We identified several genes potentially related to micropearl formation, most of them encoding Ca2+ and HCO3- transport proteins as well as carbonic anhydrases. Additionally, our results suggest that T. chui is a diploid organism, which is a characteristic never described in the past. 4.2. Introduction Micropearls are intracellular inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) observed in many species of green microalgae within the class Chlorodendrophyceae (Martignier et al., 2018). The recent discovery of these mineral inclusions was of high relevance as it demonstrated that the intracellular biomineralization of calcium carbonate in unicellular eukaryotes is a more widespread phenomenon than previously thought (Martignier et al., 2017). Indeed, apart from the intracellular formation of coccoliths (calcite plates) observed in coccolithophores, the intracellular formation of calcium carbonate in protists has traditionally been considered an uncommon process (Brownlee et al., 2015; Segovia-Campos et al., 2022b).  In addition to Ca, these mineral inclusions contain high concentrations of Sr, indicating that micropearl-forming species have evolved cellular mechanisms to highly concentrate this alkaline earth metal (Martignier et al., 2017; Martignier et al., 2018). Due to the high Sr uptake capacity of micropearl-forming species, a possible impact of these microorganisms on the geochemical cycle of Sr has been suggested (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a). Although the mechanisms underlying this process are not yet understood, one species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae, Tetraselmis chui, has already been Chapter IV 
 89 suggested as a potential candidate for the development of new bioremediation techniques to deal with radioactive 90Sr pollution (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a). Recent studies on a similar biomineralization process observed in cyanobacteria and other prokaryotic organisms concluded that the formation of intracellular ACC inclusions must be an active process (Cam et al., 2018). The formation of ACC requires saturated environments within the cell, which implies the transport of ions against a concentration gradient as well as the presence of inorganic and organic additives for its stabilization (Aizenberg et al., 1996; Mann, 2001; Weiner and Dove, 2003). In several prokaryotes, the intracellular formation of ACC inclusions has been shown to happen in cellular compartments of unknown composition where transport proteins may regulate the entrance of ions and molecules such as Ca2+ and HCO3- (Blondeau et al., 2018). In coccolithophores, coccolith formation has also been shown to take place in cell compartments called coccolith vesicles, where transport proteins located in the membrane of these vesicles may control their formation (Brownlee et al., 2020). In Chlorodendrophyceae, it has been suggested that micropearls formation must also happen in intracellular compartments, being probably controlled through the expression of specific genes (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a).  Although some species within the genus Tetraselmis (including T. chui) are extensively produced for aquaculture purposes and biodiesel production (Fabregas et al., 1984; Meseck et al., 2005; Teo et al., 2014), their complete genomes have never been sequenced except for the species Tetraselmis striata, known to form a reduced number of micropearls (Martignier et al., 2018; Steadman Tyler et al., 2019). This lack of information has hindered the study of the genetic basis of micropearl formation. Therefore, neither genetic nor transcriptomic studies have attempted to identify genes related to this biomineralization process in Chlorodendrophyceae. Even if the function of micropearls is still unknown, their formation in T. chui cells has been shown to be negatively affected in environments with low concentrations of available Ca (≤ 0.1 mM Ca) (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a). Based on this finding, the present study aims to identify T. chui genes related to this biomineralization process in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms behind micropearl formation. For this purpose, the complete genome and transcriptome of T. chui were sequenced and Chapter IV 
 90 genes potentially related to micropearl formation were identified by comparing their expression in T. chui cells cultured with different Ca concentrations. This study also investigates whether T. chui is a diploid organism, a feature rarely described in the past for the class Chlorodendrophyceae. 4.3. Methods 4.3.1. Culture medium preparation  ASP-H liquid culture medium (Littler et al., 1979), modified by McFadden and Melkonian (1986), was prepared without added Ca at pH 8.3 and autoclaved. A sterilized (by filtration) CaCl2・2H2O stock solution was subsequently added to obtain culture media with different Ca concentrations: 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mM Ca, corresponding to the tested conditions 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Fig. 1). These concentrations were chosen based on a previous study that showed that 0.1 mM Ca in the culture medium inhibits micropearl formation in T. chui and affects cell growth without being lethal, whereas 2.5 mM Ca concentrations were optimal for micropearl formation and cell growth (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a).  4.3.2. Cultures setup and sampling The strain Tetraselmis chui (SAG 8-6), obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae of the University of Göttingen (Germany), was first cultured in ASP-H medium enriched with 2.5 mM Ca in order to obtain enough inoculum to start the experiment. After two weeks of growth, the pre-culture was centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 5 min and T. chui cells were transferred to 400 mL of culture media containing different Ca concentrations at a cell density of 1x106 cells mL-1. Cultures were set in 1-L Erlenmeyer flasks that were subsequently placed in an incubator (Multitron Standard-Infors HT) at 21 °C, 110 rpm shaking, and continuous light at 2000 lux intensity.  After five days of growth, a 30-µL sample was collected from each culture for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation. Then, cultures were centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were discarded and the microalgal pellets flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen. Frozen cell samples from cultures grown with 2.5 mM Ca were used for Chapter IV 
 91 complete genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) sequencing. In addition, cell samples from cultures grown with 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mM Ca were used to perform a differential RNA expression study (Fig. 1). All samples were prepared in triplicates. 
 Figure 1: Experimental design of this study. T. chui samples from cultures enhanced with 2.5 mM Ca were used for the obtention of T. chui genome and transcriptome, whereas the RNA differential expression study was performed with T. chui samples from cultures grown with 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mM Ca. 4.3.3. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) sample preparation and observation  After five days of growth, a volume of 30 µL of T. chui cultures under conditions 1, 2, and 3 was gently filtered on polycarbonate membranes with a pore-size of 1 µm (Whatman® NucleporeTM) by applying a weak vacuum pressure. Membranes were dried at room temperature and mounted on Al stubs using a doubled sided carbon tape. The mounts were covered with a 10-nm layer of Au using low vacuum pressure sputtering. Imaging was performed with a JEOL JSM 7001F Scanning Electron Microscope using backscattered electron detection.  4.3.4. Total genomic DNA and RNA extraction DNA and RNA extractions were conducted using the kit ZymoBIOMICS DNA-RNA Miniprep (Lucerna-CHEM). The algal cell pellet was first resuspended in 750 µL DNA/RNA Shield™ that lyses cells and inactivates nucleases and infectious agents in a ZR BashingBead Lysis Tube. After homogenization using a Tissue Lyser LT (Qiagen), the homogenate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. After the addition of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer, the mixture was transferred to the Spin-Away™ Filter in a Collection Tube that was subsequently centrifuged. The flow-through was used for RNA extraction and the column for DNA purification as described in the suppliers’ manual. 
Chapter IV 
 92 RNA was treated with DNase I before elution in 50 µL water. DNA quality was assessed by migration on a 2% agarose gel, while the quality of the extracted RNA was assessed by obtaining its profile with the Caliper LabChip GX2 (Perkin Elmer). 4.3.5. Libraries preparation and sequencing The genomic DNA library was prepared for PacBio sequencing using the SMRTbell protocol (PacBio) adapted for large genomes without multiplexing. Genome DNA sequencing was performed using the SMRT cell 8M in a PacBio Sequel II System. Additionally, we performed Illumina sequencing of the genomic DNA. For that purpose, a library was prepared using the protocol DNA-seq provided by the manufacturer. Sequencing was carried out using the instrument NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina Inc.).  RNA library preparation was performed using the mRNA-Seq (Poly-A) protocol for Illumina sequencing. For the transcriptome sequencing, 120,000,000 RNA reads were sequenced, whereas 30,000,000 RNA reads were sequenced for the differential expression analysis. In both cases, sequencing was carried out using the instrument NovaSeq 6000. 4.3.6. Genome and transcriptome assembly and annotation PacBio DNA reads were assembled using de novo assembly of primary contigs using the analysis server SMRT Link (version 10.0) with SMRT Analysis of the genome assembly. The completeness of the genome assembly was assessed with the software BUSCO (version 5.3.2) (Manni et al., 2021) using the lineage dataset of Chlorophyta (chlorophyta_odb10). Genome annotation was performed using the MAKER pipeline (Cantarel et al., 2008). The existing dataset for the clade Chlorophyta (NCBI, taxonomy ID: 3041), as well as the assembled transcriptome of T. chui were used as the source for training. Assembly of the DNA Illumina contigs was attempted with the Velvet de novo assembler (Zerbino and Birney, 2008). However, the assembly failed.  RNA contigs obtained with Illumina sequencing were assembled using the de novo RNA-seq assembly pipeline Trinity (version 2.14.0) (Grabherr et al., 2011). The transcriptome annotation was performed using the tools BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) and InterProScan Chapter IV 
 93 (version 5.27-66.0) (Jones et al., 2014) associated with the UniProt and InterPro databases, respectively. 4.3.7. Single-nucleotide polymorphism assessment By visualizing the DNA PacBio and Illumina reads on the assembled genome with the software Integrative Genomics Viewer (version 2.13.1) (Robinson et al., 2011), a high number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected. To understand if this polymorphism was revealing a potential polyploidy of T. chui or if it was due to a heterogenous cell population, several T. chui cells were isolated on agar plates prepared with Algal growth medium (Fabregas et al., 1984; Pereira et al., 2016). After two weeks of growth at 21°C with continuous light at 2000 lux intensity, several colonies were carefully collected with a sterile toothpick for DNA extraction. In this case, DNA extraction was performed with the DNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Two sets of primers were designed to perform polymerase chain reactions (PCR) of two selected regions containing a high number of SNPs (Tab. 1). The quality of the PCR products was assessed by their migration on a 2% agarose gel. PCR products were then cleaned-up with a Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega) and sequenced (Sanger sequencing).

Data treatment and statistical analyses The software Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011) was used for transcripts and gene quantification with the RSEM method as well as for the differential expression analyses with the EdgeR option. Data treatment and statistical analyses were performed using the R language and Bioconductor package (Marini et al., 2020). Visualization was performed Chapter IV 
 94 with the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016). The significance of the enrichment in the functional analysis was assessed with hypergeometric tests. 4.4. Results 4.4.1. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation of micropearls To confirm that the micropearl formation process in T. chui is negatively affected in cultures with a Ca concentration of 0.1 mM, cells were imaged using SEM after five days of growth (Fig. 2). Cultures enriched with 0.1 mM Ca (condition 1) showed the lowest number of micropearls per cell, indicating the inhibition of the micropearl formation process. Indeed, although some micropearls were observed, they had probably been formed before the cells were transferred to the new culture medium (as a previous study showed that no micropearls were visible in T. chui cells after 12 days of growth under this culture condition (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022)). Cultures amended with 0.5 and 2.5 mM Ca (conditions 2 and 3, respectively) showed a higher number of micropearls per cell, without a noticeable difference between these two conditions. 
 Figure 2: SEM images of T. chui cells grown for five days with different concentrations of Ca: (A) 0.1, (B) 0.5, and (C) 2.5 mM Ca. Micropearls appear as white grains (<1µm) within the cells. The black dots observed in the background correspond to the pores of the polycarbonate membranes used to prepare the samples.  4.4.2. Complete genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation A complete genome sequence of the microalga T. chui was generated using PacBio sequencing. The length of the assembled genome was 362,171,450 bp (362 Mb), derived 
Chapter IV 
 95 from 3,897 contigs, with a N50 value of 155,676 bp, and a GC content of 53%. 58% of the genome showed a 2x coverage, indicating a possible diploidy of T. chui (Fig. 3).  
 Figure 3: Average coverage of the PacBio contigs according to the contig length. Two clusters are differentiated, indicating that 149,769,927 bp of the genome (42%) show a 1x coverage, whereas the other 212,399,085 bp (58%) show a 2x coverage.  The BUSCO assessment of the genome assembly provided satisfactory results: 64.5% were complete and single-copy BUSCOs, 22.3% complete and duplicate BUSCOs, 3.6% were fragmented BUSCOs, and 9.6% missing BUSCOs (n=1519) (Fig. 4). In addition, by using the alignment algorithm BWA-MEM (Li, 2013), 97.2% of the Illumina DNA reads mapped into the PacBio assembly, proving its high quality. The complete genome sequence of T. chui with the respective annotations will be available in a digital repository.

Chapter IV 
 96 4.4.3. Transcriptome sequencing, assembly, and annotation The transcriptome of T. chui grown with 2.5 mM Ca was obtained using Illumina RNA sequencing. With the alignment algorithm BWA-MEM (Li, 2013), 97.7% of the Illumina RNA-seq reads mapped onto the transcriptome assembly, proving its high quality. 240,205 isoforms were detected from 82,333 distinct genes. 32% of these genes (26,678) were annotated with BLAST or InterProScan and we obtained information about the function of 17,405 genes (i.e., an associated UniProt GO term or an InterPro match).  4.4.4. RNA differential expression study and detection of genes potentially related to micropearl formation. Out of the 82,333 genes obtained in the transcriptome assembly, only 45,258 genes were expressed at least in one of the three tested conditions for the RNA differential expression study. 21,113 of those genes had a BLAST or an InterPro annotation, and 14,077 had information about their function. The RNA differential expression study was conducted with the genes that had a BLAST or an InterPro annotation. The obtention of heatmaps revealing the fold changes in the expressions of 10,000 randomly chosen genes showed significant expression differences between the three tested conditions (Fig. 5).   Figure 5:  Heatmap showing the differential expression of 10,000 randomly chosen genes under the different tested culture conditions. Each column corresponds to one gene and each row to one sample. C1, C2, and C3 correspond to cultures containing 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mM Ca, respectively. R1, R2, and R3 correspond to replicate 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Expressions were log2-transformed and normalized according to the mean gene value. Therefore, value 0 corresponds to the average expression of the gene between the three tested conditions. Value 2 corresponds to an expression 4 times higher than the average and value –2 to an expression 4 times lower than the average.  Genes were grouped in clusters according to their expression changes between the three tested conditions (Fig. 6). Their annotated UniProt function and Go terms were analyzed (Fig. 7 and 8). Cluster 4 contained genes whose expression decreased from condition 3 
Chapter IV 
 97 to condition 2 and did not show expression differences between conditions 2 and 1. The most common UniProt functions associated with these genes were: sodium/solute symporter, cation transporter ATPase, and alpha carbonic anhydrase (Fig. 7). By analyzing the annotated UniProt GO terms, the cluster 5, which includes genes showing a gradual decreasing expression between the condition 3 and the condition 1, grouped genes potentially coding for metal and Ca binding proteins (Fig. 8). Finally, the cluster 6, corresponding to genes showing a low expression in condition 1, grouped genes related to the homeostasis function of the cells (Fig. 8). In order to further identify genes potentially involved in micropearl formation, we sorted out genes with associated functions related to Ca and HCO3- that showed high expression differences (fold change ³ 2.8 and £-2.8) between the conditions 3 and 1 (2.5 and 0.5 mM Ca, respectively). Most of the Ca-related genes were associated with Ca transport (Fig. 9): Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-permeable stress-gated cation channels, membrane-associated Na+/Ca2+ exchangers, Ca2+-transporting ATPases, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and vacuolar cation/proton exchangers with an associated Ca2+/H+ antiporter domain function. As observed in the corresponding heatmap, in some cases, they were highly expressed in condition 3 compared to condition 1 and, in other cases, they were strongly expressed in condition 1 compared to condition 3. Interestingly, the expression of these genes in condition 2 was intermediate in most of the cases, observing a gradual expression change through conditions 1, 2, and 3. All HCO3--related genes were also listed with their respective heatmap (Fig. 10). Six genes showed a particularly strong expression difference between conditions 1 and 3, showing the highest expression of these genes in condition 3 (2.5 mM Ca). Most of these genes coded either for HCO3- transporters, such as Na+/ HCO3- cotransporters belonging to the solute carrier family 4 (SLC4) and anion exchangers. In addition, a higher expression of a-carbonic anhydrases was also observed with high Ca concentrations. Chapter IV

X axis shows the log2-fold change between conditions 2 and 3, whereas Y axis shows the fold change between conditions 1 and 2. Genes were clustered according to their position on the layout. Genes outside the circle (radius = 2) show the highest expression change between the conditions and only these genes will be considered for further analysis of the functional enrichment.

 103 4.4.5. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis We detected a high number of SNPs, mainly located in non-coding regions (introns). For most of the detected SNPs, 50% of the DNA reads showed a particular nucleotide, different from that observed in the other 50%. To understand whether these SNPs are due to variations between cells within the same strain or if they take place within a single cell, we sequenced, from a single T. chui colony, two regions of the genome presenting SNPs: contig 000010F position 159591-159974 bp and contig 000001F position 48327-49039 bp. Sequencing of the PCR products revealed the same SNPs observed in the PacBio and Illumina DNA reads, indicating that these SNPs occur within a single cell (Fig. 11).  
 Figure 11: Sequence of a PCR product obtained from a single T. chui colony. Several SNPs are detected (framed in red) and two different nucleotides are observed in each SNP. The sequenced fragment corresponds to a region of T. chui genome where a high number of SNPs was detected (ctg.000001F:48327-49039). R = A or G; Y = C or T; S = G or C; K= G or T; and M = A or C. 4.5. Discussion  4.5.1. Comparison of T. chui and T. striata complete genome drafts In the past, only the complete genome of T. striata had been sequenced among the Tetraselmis genus (Steadman Tyler et al., 2019). This study presents, for the first time, the complete genome of T. chui (SAG 8-6), showing a genome size larger than that 
Chapter IV  
 104 obtained from T. striata (362 vs 228 Mb, respectively). Indeed, the total number of genes is almost twice in T. chui compared to that obtained from T. striata (82,333 vs 48,906 genes, respectively). However, if T. chui is confirmed as a diploid organism, its haploid genome length would be around 287 Mb, calculated as:  𝐻𝑎𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑖𝑑	𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑒	𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ=1	2𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑒	𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ	𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑔	1𝑥	𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒+	𝐺𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑒	𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ	𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑔	2𝑥	𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 In any case, the larger genome of T. chui compared to that of T. striata could indicate that, despite being species belonging to the same genus, they could be relatively distant phylogenetically. Interestingly, phylogenies of the class Chlorodendrophyceae that were inferred from rbcL as well as 5.8S rDNA and ITS2 sequence data placed these species in two distinct clades (Martignier et al., 2020). In addition, SEM observations also revealed differences in the micropearl number per cell, being in smaller quantity in T. striata compared to T. chui (Martignier et al., 2018). Altogether, these observations seem to confirm that the two species are rather distant from each other. 4.5.2. Ca2+ transport We identified a group of genes that have an associated Ca-related function and show a strong expression difference between cultures containing the highest and the lowest tested Ca concentrations (2.5 and 0.1 mM Ca, respectively). Some of these genes show a maximal expression in presence of high concentrations of Ca (2.5 mM) in the culture medium and a minimal expression at low Ca concentrations (0.1 mM), whereas the opposite is also observed: a maximal expression of Ca-related genes at low Ca concentrations and a minimal expression when Ca concentration in the culture medium is high. In both cases, most of the genes seem to code for Ca2+ transporters. These differences in the expression pattern of the genes could be related to the location and function of the proteins they code for. Since T. chui growth needs a high Ca uptake (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a), it seems reasonable that at low Ca concentrations in the culture medium (0.1 mM Ca), T. chui highly expresses genes related to Ca2+ transport at the cell membrane level in order to maximize the cell uptake of this element. Alternatively (or simultaneously), some of these highly expressed genes could be also related to the mobilization of Ca stored in the micropearls. Under these culture conditions, the micropearl formation process does not seem to take place (as observed using SEM; Fig. Chapter IV  
 105 2A) and, therefore, genes directly related to the intracellular formation of micropearls are probably repressed. According to our results, the proteins that could be potentially involved in Ca2+ uptake at the cell membrane level and/or in the mobilization of Ca stored in micropearls are Ca2+-dependent or Ca2+-permeable stress-gated cation channels and membrane-associated Na+/Ca2+ exchangers.  When Ca is available at high concentrations in the culture medium, the micropearl formation process takes place (as observed using SEM; Fig. 2B, C). Therefore, genes that are highly expressed under these culture conditions may be mainly related to the micropearl formation process. Indeed, we identified several genes coding for proteins that could have a potential implication in the formation of micropearls. These proteins are Ca2+-transporting ATPases, vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchangers, and voltage-gated Ca-channels (Fig. 9). Interestingly, membrane-associated Na+/Ca2+ exchangers were also highly expressed under these culture conditions and could be involved in maintaining Ca2+ cell homeostasis as it has been already suggested in the case of coccolithophores (Taylor and Brownlee, 2016). Although not yet proven, micropearls could form within vacuoles or vesicles containing some of these transporters at the membrane level. Indeed, transport proteins such as Ca2+/H+ exchangers have also been suggested to facilitate Ca2+ uptake into the coccoliths vesicles in coccolithophores (Taylor and Brownlee, 2016). Similar pumps, channels, and exchangers have also been described in the membrane of acidocalcisomes. These cellular structures are present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and contain polyphosphates (poly P) that form complexes with Ca and other cations. In these cellular compartments, Ca2+ uptake occurs through a vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase, and then Ca2+ exits the acidocalcisome via a Ca2+/H+ exchanger (Docampo et al., 2010). In cyanobacteria forming intracellular ACC inclusions, Ca2+/H+ exchangers have also been identified as proteins potentially involved in the formation of the ACC inclusions (De Wever et al., 2019). However, the location of these transporters in cyanobacteria is not clear yet. 4.5.3. HCO3- transport Considering the chemical composition of micropearls, genes with associated functions related to HCO3- uptake have been also identified. As previously mentioned, six genes Chapter IV  
 106 showed a higher expression with high Ca concentrations in the medium, while their expression was repressed with low Ca concentration. Most of these genes encode Na+/HCO3- cotransporters belonging to the solute family 4 (SLC4), anions exchangers, as well as for carbonic anhydrases. Given their maximum expression when conditions are suitable for micropearl formation, these proteins may also be directly involved in this biomineralization process. A study where the expression of genes related to biomineralization in the coccolithophore Emiliana huxleyi was studied also concluded that HCO3- transporters belonging to the solute carrier 4 as well as carbonic anhydrases were upregulated under calcifying conditions (Mackinder et al., 2011).  4.5.4. H+ and pH homeostasis In coccolithophores, it has been demonstrated that the intracellular formation of coccoliths requires strong pH homeostasis since the use of HCO3- as the source of inorganic C for the formation of CaCO3 generates 1 mol of H+ per mol of CaCO3 (Mackinder et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2011). In order to maintain the pH of the cytosol, coccolithophores must possess mechanisms to strongly control the intracellular pH. Micropearls are also composed of CaCO3 and, therefore, their formation must also be coupled to mechanisms buffering or removing this excess of protons in the cytosol. Although in this study we have not analyzed in depth the genes that could be linked to this process, we have observed that some genes related to homeostatic processes were downregulated with low Ca concentrations in the medium (Fig. 7). These genes may be essential for maintaining the intracellular pH during the micropearl formation process.  4.5.5. Missing information It is important to emphasize that this study only compares the expression of 26% of the total genes predicted in T. chui transcriptome. Indeed, only genes with a known associated function that were expressed in at least one of the three compared conditions were considered in the study. Therefore, it is likely that some key genes in micropearl biomineralization have been overlooked. Future genomic and transcriptomic studies of T. chui and other micropearl-forming species will be necessary to decipher the molecular processes behind this biomineralization process as well as their location within the cell. Chapter IV  
 107 4.5.6. Is T. chui a diploid organism? This study unexpectedly revealed a high number of SNPs in T. chui genome, being more frequent in non-coding regions. For most of the detected SNPs, two different nucleotides were observed with a frequency of 50% each. After confirming that these SNPs are found within a single T. chui cell, this finding suggests that T. chui is a diploid organism. Furthermore, the fact that the PacBio reads coverage was double in 58% of T. chui genome seems to further reinforce this idea. In the past, an electrophoretic survey of the genus Tetraselmis found that several strains showed electrophoretic phenotypes characteristic of heterozygotes, also suggesting that these organisms are diploid (Huber and Lewin, 1986). Interestingly, it has traditionally been said that sexual reproduction has never been observed in the class of Chlorodendophyceae (Arora et al., 2013; Borowitzka, 2018). However, this finding could indicate the occurrence of sexual reproduction within this class. If this is confirmed, it would strongly change the current understanding of the ecology and evolution of these microalgae. 4.6. Conclusions The molecular processes behind micropearl formation in the class of green microalgae Chlorodendrophyceae had never been investigated in the past. For the first time, the genome and transcriptome of T. chui have been sequenced and analyzed in order to identify genes that could be potentially related to the formation of micropearls. Most of the genes identified code for Ca2+ and HCO3- transporters but their cellular localization is not clear yet.  Since only 26% of the predicted genes have been analyzed, we may have overlooked genes coding for proteins whose functions are essential to micropearl formation. Future research is necessary to understand the possible involvement of these genes and the processes regulating their expression. Finally, we unexpectedly discovered a high number of SNPs in T. chui genome showing frequencies characteristic of diploid organisms. This finding suggests the occurrence of sexual reproduction in the class Chlorodendrophyceae, which has never been reported in the past. Chapter IV

 112 5.1. Abstract The cellular mechanisms behind the formation of intracellular inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) observed in several species of green microalgae within the class Chlorodendrophyceae remain unknown. This is partly due to the poor stability of ACC, dissolving easily with traditional sample preparation techniques for electron microscopy. Although it has been suggested that these mineral inclusions, called micropearls, form in intracellular compartments, this has not been proven yet. Here, we analyze the ultrastructure of Tetraselmis chui to clarify whether micropearls are formed within intracellular compartments. High-pressure freezing, freeze substitution, and resin embedding were used for T. chui sample preparation in order to preserve micropearls as much as possible. Although micropearls were not present in the 50-nm thick sections, a monolayered structure delimiting the holes where micropearls were originally located could be observed. On the other hand, analysis of the resin block by using Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS) allowed to perform chemical bioimaging of T. chui cytoplasm without losing the micropearls, and to track the incorporation of 44Ca and 88Sr into these mineral inclusions. Both isotopes move from the culture medium to the micropearls in less than one hour, showing that the micropearl formation process is even faster than previously suggested. In addition, 44Ca and 88Sr were always detected together. Results also suggest that Mg and S are involved in the formation of these mineral inclusions. Finally, a new technique for micropearl extraction and purification using isopropanol in a serial filtration process is presented.  5.2. Introduction Many green microalgae species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae have been discovered to form intracellular mineral inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) (Martignier et al., 2018). These inclusions are called micropearls and it has been observed that they can contain high concentrations of Sr compared to its concentration in the extracellular medium. Although the ultrastructure of several species comprised in the class Chlorodendrophyceae have been extensively studied in the past, this Chapter V  
 113 biomineralization process had been overlooked until recently (Martignier et al., 2017; Segovia-Campos et al., 2022b). ACC is the most unstable calcium carbonate polymorph. It can be found in both hydrated and anhydrous forms (Addadi et al., 2003). Even if it undergoes rapid phase transformation in inorganic systems, stable ACC has been observed in biological systems probably due to the effect of other ions and macromolecules (Mann, 2001). Indeed, it has been shown that ACC formation takes place in highly supersaturated solutions in which additives (such as Mg or proteins) are present to prevent the deposition of crystalline phases (Aizenberg et al., 1996; Loste et al., 2003; Weiner and Dove, 2003). In addition, basic pH and high alkalinity are also required, as they are critical conditions for carbonate precipitation (Cam et al., 2015). For these chemical conditions to be met, several studies have suggested that micropearls are most likely isolated from the rest of the cell cytoplasm by some membrane-like structure that regulates ions and molecules influx/efflux to/from the nucleation sites (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a; Segovia-Campos et al., 2022b) (Chapter IV). Although some prokaryotic organisms forming intracellular ACC present a monolayered structure that envelopes the mineral inclusions individually (Blondeau et al., 2018), this type of structure has never been observed in the class Chlorodendrophyceae. Previous studies in which cross-sections of micropearls were observed using Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy (TEM and SEM, respectively), revealed concentric zonations in micropearls (Martignier et al., 2017; Martignier et al., 2018). Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (TEM-EDXS) analyses of the cross sections showed that these zonations were due to variations in the Sr/Ca concentration ratios, but the presence of organic structures related to micropearls was not observed. Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry  (NanoSIMS) analyses of the surface of dried Chlorodendrophyceae cells were also performed but did not provide conclusive information on the presence of any organic structure controlling the biomineralization process (Martignier et al., 2017). These analyses were limited to the cell surface and did not include the study of the elemental distribution in the intracellular space. A recent study has shown that micropearls in the species Tetraselmis chui form in a time scale of a few hours, with Sr being incorporated in the mineral inclusions in less than 9 h Chapter V  
 114 (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a). The Sr/Ca mol% ratio in T. chui micropearls can be 12 times higher than in the culture medium, suggesting a selective concentration of Sr in the micropearls. It has been suggested that Sr is absorbed by the cells following the same uptake pathways as Ca, as both elements share similar chemical properties (Walker, 1953; Miledi, 1966; Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a). However, the formation process of micropearls as well as the cellular mechanisms behind the high Sr accumulation are still poorly understood. In practice, the low stability of ACC makes the study of the micropearl formation rather challenging. Traditional sample preparation protocols for electron microscopy observation cause micropearls dissolution (Martignier et al., 2017). On the other hand, micropearls are translucent and hence invisible under the optical microscope with standard settings. These can be the reasons why their existence had been overlooked in the past.  A sample preparation technique including high-pressure freezing, freeze substitution, and resin embedding allowed the preservation of the organic envelopes observed around ACC inclusions of cyanobacteria using TEM (Blondeau et al., 2018). In this study, we applied this approach to study the ultrastructure of T. chui cells in order to detect any possible cellular structure related to micropearls. In addition, we tracked spatial and temporal movements of 44Ca and 88Sr within T. chui cells by developing a new sample preparation protocol that allows performing NanoSIMS analysis in the intracellular space of T. chui cells without losing the micropearls. Finally, based on a study that demonstrated that ACC was stable in isopropanol (Rodriguez-Blanco et al., 2008), we developed a technique to extract the micropearls from T. chui cells. This technique could facilitate the study of the organic content (if any) of micropearls in further research. 5.3. Methods 5.3.1. Strain and culture conditions The strain Tetraselmis chui (SAG 8-6) was obtained from the Culture collection of Algae at the University of Göttingen (Germany) and cultured in ASP-H medium (Littler et al., 1979) modified by McFadden and Melkonian (1986). Cultures were set in 200-mL Chapter V  
 115 Erlenmeyer flasks and placed in an incubator (Multitron Standard- Infors HT) with continuous light at 400 lux intensity, 110 rpm agitation, and 21 °C. 5.3.2. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): sample preparation and imaging of T. chui cells T. chui samples for TEM observation were collected from cultures in the exponential growth stage (5x10-5 cell mL-1). One-milliliter samples were centrifuged in 1.5-mL Eppendorf ® tubes at 5500 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. Algal cells were collected and thick suspensions of T. chui cells were high-pressure frozen using an HPF Compact 02 (Wohlwend GmbH, Sennwald, Switzerland).  Then, the samples were cryo-substituted in an AFS2 (Leica Mikrosysteme GmbH, Vienna, Austria). This was done in OsO4 (EMS, Hatfield, PA, US) 2% solution in acetone 100% (Sigma, St Louis, MO, US), from -90 °C to -30 °C during four days and then washed two times with acetone 100% at -30°C during 30 min. Samples were subsequently infiltrated in Epon (Sigma, St Louis, MO, US) at graded concentrations (Epon 1/3 acetone-4 h from -30 °C to 0 °C; Epon 1/1 acetone-2 h from 0°C to 20°C, Epon 3/1 acetone-2 h from at 20°C, Epon-6 h at 20 °C) and finally polymerized for 48 h at 60 °C in an oven.  Ultrathin (50 nm) and semithin (250 nm) sections of the polymerized resin block were cut with an Ultra 45° diamond knife (Diatome Ltd, Nidau, Switzerland) on a Leica Ultracut ultramicrotome (Leica Mikrosysteme GmbH, Vienna, Austria). Because we suspected that micropearls might dissolve if the sections were in contact with water (normally water is used during the cutting process), the 250-nm sections were also cut without adding water in the ultramicrotome. The sections were picked up on a copper slot grid 2x1 mm (EMS, Hatfield, PA, US) coated with a polystyrene film (Sigma, St Louis, MO, US). Only the ultrathin sections (50-nm thick) were poststained with uranyl acetate (Sigma, St Louis, MO, US) 4% in H2O for 10 min and rinsed several times with H2O. Finally, they were also stained with Reynolds lead citrate in water (Sigma, St Louis, MO, US) for 10 min and rinsed several times with water. Micrographs were taken with a transmission electron microscope Philips CM100 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA) at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV with a TVIPS Chapter V  
 116 TemCam-F416 digital camera (TVIPS GmbH, Gauting, Germany). Large montage alignment was performed using Blendmont command-line program from the IMOD software (Kremer et al., 1996). 5.3.3. Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (NanoSIMS): sample preparation and analysis of T. chui A T. chui culture in the exponential growth stage was spiked with 44CaCl2 • 2H2O (98% atom% 44Ca, Sigma-Aldrich) and SrCl2 •  6H2O to obtain the following concentrations in the culture medium: 0.47 mM 44Ca (corresponding to a 10x 44Ca enrichment) and 0.5 mM Sr. After 1, 5, 9, and 24 h, 1-mL aliquots of the cultures were collected (in triplicates). As a control, a sample was also collected before the addition of 44Ca and Sr.  All the samples were immediately centrifuged after collection in 1.5-mL Eppendorf® tubes at 5500 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. Cells were rapidly high-pressure frozen and cryo-substituted following the protocol previously described. After the infiltration in Epon, the resin block (sample part only) was cut with a saw and glued on an Al stub with conductive resin EpoTek H20S (EMS, Hatfield, PA, US) and polymerized overnight at 60°C in an oven. It was then trimmed and the front face flattened with an Ultra 45° diamond knife (Diatome Ltd, Nidau, Switzerland) on a Leica Ultracut S (Leica Mikrosysteme GmbH, Vienna, Austria) without using water. Finally, the mounts were coated with 3 nm of Pt using a Leica EM SCD 500 sputter coater (Leica Mikrosysteme GmbH, Vienna, Austria). Before performing NanoSIMS analysis, large imaging montages of the samples were taken with Maps software on a scanning electron microscope Helios Nanolab 650 FIB-SEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). Images were acquired by detecting backscattered electrons with the Mirror detector (BSE-MD) in immersion mode, at 2 mm of working distance and an electron beam of 5kV, 800 pA, and 6 μs of dwell time. The montage alignment was performed using Blendmont command-line program from the IMOD software (Kremer et al., 1996). The horizontal field width of the montage was around 125 µm and the pixel size 4.081 nm. Chapter V  
 117 After SEM image acquisition, samples were analyzed in a NanoSIMS 50 L secondary ion mass spectrometer. This allowed the imaging and quantification of the subcellular distribution of the following isotopes: 24Mg, 32S, 44Ca, and 88Sr. Analysis of 32S was performed using a Cs+ beam (130-180 nm), whereas analysis of 24Mg, 44Ca, and 88Sr was performed with an O- beam (500-650 nm). Ions were counted in electron multipliers at a mass resolution of >9000 (Cameca definition), allowing to resolve potential interferences in the mass spectrum. For each image, ten stacked planes were acquired and processed with the software L’IMAGE (version 10.1; LR Nittler, Carnegie Institution). Finally, they were superimposed to the SEM images using the software Affinity Photo (v. 1.10.5) and Affinity Designer (v. 1.10.5) 5.3.4. Micropearl extraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation A new protocol for micropearl extraction was developed in this study based on the work of Rodriguez-Blanco et al. (2008). T. chui cultures were centrifuged in 50-mL Falcon® tubes and the supernatant was discarded. The algal pellets were transferred to 1.5-mL Eppendorf® tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and freeze-dried (Alpha 2-4, Christ) for 24 h. Quartz beads with a diameter of 0.4 mm were added to the tubes and the lyophilized cells were disrupted using a tissue disruptor (Tissue Lyser, Qiagen) at a frequency of 20 Hz for 2 min. The disrupted cells were then resuspended in isopropanol (99.5% Acros Organics) to perform a serial filtration process with different pore-size polycarbonate membranes (Whatman® NucleporeTM). First, the mixture was filtered in 5 µm pore-size membrane. After filtration, the membrane was dried at room temperature and the filtrate was collected for further filtration. The same process was repeated with 2, 1, and 0.2 µm pore-size membranes. With this technique, micropearls (free of cellular debris) were expected to be retained in the membrane with a pore size of 0.2 µm. The membranes were then prepared for SEM observation. They were mounted on Al stubs with a double-sided conductive carbon tape and coated with a layer of 10 nm Au using low vacuum sputter coating. SEM observation was performed with a JEOL JSM 7001F Scanning Electron Microscope using backscattered electron detection.  Chapter V  
 118 5.4. Results 5.4.1. TEM observation of T. chui  To determine if any cellular structure was associated with micropearls, we analyzed the ultrastructure of T. chui cell using TEM. The preparation of 50-nm thick sections did not allow the preservation of micropearls within T. chui cells. Instead, several well-defined holes of a diameter of less than 1 µm were detected, mainly in the anterior part of the cells, close to the cell invagination from which the flagella emerge (Fig. 1A). These holes were delimited by a monolayered structure of unknown nature that did not appear to be related to any organelle (Fig. 1). The observation of 250-nm thick sections of T. chui cells also revealed holes in the apical side of the cells, without any micropearl being visible (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the absence of the micropearls was due to the contact of the sections with water during the cutting process (the use of water is normally required for cutting), 250-nm thick sections were dry-cut with the ultramicrotome. With this preparation technique, micropearls were present. They were observed as very dense bodies, located inside the holes previously observed. However, the quality of the preparation was not optimal (Fig. 2C). We can conclude, from these results, that there is a monolayered structure enveloping micropearls individually. 5.4.2. Chemical bioimaging of calcium-44 and strontium-88 assimilation by T. chui cells SEM observation of the resin blocks containing T. chui cells showed the suitability of the sample preparation technique for NanoSIMS analysis, as both cells and micropearls were well preserved (Fig. 3). The incorporation of 44Ca and 88Sr into the micropearls was tracked by imaging these elements in T. chui cytoplasm. Interestingly, an enrichment of 44Ca and 88Sr was already noticed in T. chui micropearls 1 h after their addition to the culture. However, most of the micropearls were damaged during the analysis due to the high energy of the ion beam, explaining the blurring of the signal for 44Ca and 88Sr in the areas where the micropearls were originally located (Fig. 4). By expressing 44Ca and 88Sr enrichment within the cells as logarithmic values, we detected Chapter V  
 119 that both 44Ca and 88Sr were also present in the regions surrounding micropearls, mainly in the anterior part of the cell (Fig. 5). On the other hand, these elements were not detected in the pyrenoid and the starch grains, located in the posterior part of the cells.

 121 5.4.3. Imaging of magnesium-24 and sulfur-32 distribution in T. chui cells Magnesium-24 and 32S distribution was also analyzed in T. chui cells. Before the addition of 44Ca and 88Sr in the culture, 24Mg was mainly detected in micropearls (Fig. 5). However, after the addition of these elements, 24Mg was detected in several regions of T. chui cells: (i) close to the cell membrane or cell wall; (ii) in some areas of the cytoplasm, especially near micropearls; and (iii) in some, but not all, the micropearls. One hour after the spike, 24Mg was extensively detected in the cytoplasm, including the areas where micropearls were observed, and near the cell wall. After 5 h and onwards, 24Mg was strongly detected only in some micropearls, especially in those where 44Ca and 88Sr signals were weaker. Together with 44Ca and 88Sr, 24Mg was also detected in areas of the cytoplasm surrounding micropearls, mainly in the anterior part of the cells, as well as in some regions near the cell wall. Regarding 32S distribution, this element was always strongly detected in the cell wall and in the micropearls.  Chapter V

SEM observation of extracted micropearls SEM observation of the polycarbonate membranes used during the micropearl extraction process showed that many micropearls were successfully extracted from T. chui cells using the technique developed in this study (Fig. 6). Indeed, many free micropearls were 
Chapter V  
 124 observed on the 0.2 µm pore size membranes. However, we also observed that a large number of micropearls were lost during the process since they were trapped in the cellular debris and, therefore, they were retained in membranes with pore sizes that should have allowed them to pass through. In any case, micropearls were well preserved, showing the same morphology and size as micropearls observed within T. chui cells using SEM.

Several micropearls are indicated with white arrows.  5.5. Discussion  5.5.1. Water and micropearl dissolution  It has been suggested that the use of glutaraldehyde, OsO4, and ethanol during the sample preparation process for electron microscopy may dissolve intracellular ACC inclusions (Martignier et al., 2017; Blondeau et al., 2018). The present study shows that 
Chapter V  
 125 high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution of T. chui cells, which implies the use of OsO4 and ethanol, did not dissolve micropearls. However, micropearl dissolution occurred during the cutting process. At this stage of the sample preparation, the cut thin sections are deposited in a small water reservoir where they float, allowing them to be easily collected and deposited on a support. The contact of the ACC with water must have caused its dissolution as it is well-known that ACC is highly soluble in water (Brečević and Nielsen, 1989).  5.5.2. Micropearls within intracellular compartments? The observation of ultrathin sections of T. chui cells using TEM revealed a cellular structure enveloping each micropearl individually. However, unlike the lipid bilayer that composes the cell membrane as well as the membranes of vacuoles and vesicles, the structures surrounding micropearls seem to be monolayered. Although the composition of this cellular structure is not yet known, it seems very similar to that observed in cyanobacteria forming intracellular ACC inclusions (Blondeau et al., 2018). In cyanobacteria, it has been suggested that these structures could be composed either of a protein shell or a lipid monolayer. To our knowledge, monolayers in eukaryotic cells have only been observed around lipid droplets (Brown, 2001). They are composed of phospholipids with the hydrophilic headgroup facing the cytoplasm (Brown, 2001; Tauchi-Sato et al., 2002). Several proteins have been detected on the surface of these phospholipid monolayers, playing a key role in droplet formation (Brown, 2001; Fujimoto et al., 2001). Hence, we could expect that a similar structure envelopes micropearls, controlling the biomineralization process. However, further research is needed to determine the nature of the organic monolayer associated with micropearls.  In any case, the presence of these cellular structures could indicate that micropearl formation occurs in an environment isolated from the cytosol, possibly allowing meeting favorable chemical conditions for ACC precipitation and stabilization. Interestingly, genes potentially related to micropearl formation have been shown to encode transmembrane proteins (Chapter IV). Considering the results obtained in this study, these proteins may be located in a membranous organelle that plays an important intermediary role in the transport of HCO3- and Ca2+ toward micropearls.

 126 5.5.3. A sample preparation protocol for NanoSIMS analysis of T. chui cytoplasm The preparation of ultrathin and semithin sections of T. chui cells did not allow to obtain good-quality samples in which micropearls were preserved. Thus, in this study we developed a sample preparation technique that allows chemical bioimaging of the intracellular space of T. chui cells without losing the micropearls. This has been achieved by: (i) flash freezing T. chui cells and then performing a freeze substitution and resin embedding of the samples (so far, same technique as the one used in this study for TEM sample preparation); (ii) analyzing the pre-flattened surface of the resin block where the sample is located (instead of cutting and analyzing ultrathin sections).  Even if the ultrastructure of T. chui cells cannot be seen with high definition, this technique allows the identification of pyrenoids, starch grains, and micropearls using SEM. Furthermore, after performing NanoSIMS analysis, the analyzed part of the resin block can be cut into ultrathin sections that can be observed in the TEM to identify the organelles and regions of interest within the cell (this was not performed in the present study).  Unfortunately, we observed that the high energy of the ion beam damaged the fragile micropearls, blurring the signal of the elements contained. This effect might be avoided or, at least, reduced by decreasing the beam energy.  5.5.4. Calcium and strontium incorporation into micropearls  A previous study showed that Sr was incorporated into micropearls in less than 9 h (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a). Here, NanoSIMS analyses of T. chui cells cultured in a growth medium spiked with 44Ca and 88Sr show that both isotopes are incorporated into micropearls in less than 1 h, indicating that the micropearl formation process is faster than previously described. Interestingly, we also observe the presence of 44Ca and 88Sr in some areas of the cell surrounding micropearls, mainly in the anterior part of the cells, suggesting that some cellular structures could be involved in the intracellular transport of these elements. To identify these structures, it would be interesting to observe the analyzed samples using TEM. In the green microalgae Chlamydomonas, it has been shown Chapter V  
 127 that Ca mostly accumulates in the pyrenoids as well as in contractile vacuoles located in the anterior part of the cells (Penen et al., 2016). Although SEM and NanoSIMS analyses clearly show that Ca is neither accumulated in the pyrenoids nor in the starch grains, it is not excluded that vacuoles within T. chui cells could be involved in Ca and Sr transport. Finally, 44Ca and 88Sr are always detected within the cell, suggesting that they might share common cellular pathways to reach the micropearl formation sites.   5.5.5. Magnesium and sulfur role in micropearl formation Magnesium incorporation within ACC has been shown to delay its transformation into crystalline phases (Loste et al., 2003). In biological systems, Mg is considered an important additive for ACC stabilization, being detected in almost all known biogenic ACC deposits (Addadi et al., 2003; Weiner et al., 2003; Politi et al., 2010; Albéric et al., 2018). In this study, we show that, although this is not always the case, high concentrations of Mg can be present in micropearls. We also observed that Mg can be associated with Ca and Sr in other areas of the cell (near micropearl location) and that its concentration within T. chui cells increases 1 h after the addition of 44Ca and 88Sr in the culture. These observations suggest that Mg could be involved in the micropearl formation process.  The analysis of S distribution in T. chui cells shows that this element is intimately associated with the cell wall and the micropearls. The cell wall (also called theca) of Tetraselmis is composed of carbohydrates (80%) and other minor components such as proteins (5%) and sulfate (6%) (Becker et al., 1991), explaining the detection of S in this region. On the other hand, the S content observed in micropearls has been related to the presence of organic matter (i.e. proteins) (Martignier et al., 2017). Although it has been strongly suggested that micropearl formation must be controlled by proteins located in a membrane-like structure surrounding these inclusions (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a) (Chapter IV), the composition of the organic matter associated with micropearls has not yet been studied. Micropearl analysis using tecniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Mehta et al., 2022) or soft X-ray scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) (Cosmidis and Benzerara, 2014) could provide valuable information on this regard. Chapter V  
 128 5.5.6.  A new protocol for micropearl extraction In this study, we present a new protocol for micropearl extraction which could facilitate the study of these ACC inclusions in future research. Moreover, the technique developed here can be improved, reducing the number of micropearls lost during the extraction process. First, the cell disruption process could be optimized by changing the size of the quartz beads and/or by increasing the duration of the process. Secondly, the cellular residues retained in the first filtration series could be resuspended in isopropanol and re-filtered. Repeating this step several times should decrease the number of micropearls remaining attached to the cell fragments. Finally, it is important to note that the contact of micropearls with isopropanol may modify their chemical and mineralogical composition as well as their structure. If this is confirmed (by using techniques such as FTIR or Raman spectroscopy), it must be ensured that it will not alter the results of future analyses. 5.6. Conclusions The poor stability of ACC had limited the study of the micropearl formation process in Chlorodendrophyceae because traditional sample preparation techniques for electron microscopy dissolve micropearls (Martignier et al., 2017). Here, the use of a sample preparation technique involving high-pressure freezing, freeze substitution, and resin embedding allowed the preservation of micropearls in T. chui cells.  Despite the micropearl dissolution detected during the resin block cutting process, TEM observation of T. chui ultrathin sections (50-nm thick) revealed a monolayered structure enveloping each micropearl individually. This structure looks very similar to that observed around ACC inclusions in cyanobacteria (Blondeau et al., 2018). Although the nature of this layer is not yet identified, its presence indicates that micropearl formation could occur in intracellular compartments isolated from the cytosol.  NanoSIMS analysis of resin blocks containing T. chui cells allowed to perform chemical bioimaging of T. chui cytoplasm without losing the micropearls. The incorporation of Ca and Sr into micropearls is faster than predicted in previous studies (Thien et al., 2017; Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a). In addition, Sr is always detected together with Ca in T. Chapter V  
 129 chui cytoplasm, suggesting that both elements probably follow the same cellular pathways towards micropearls. This study also reveals a potential implication of Mg and S in the process of micropearl formation. Finally, the present study provides a new technique for micropearl extraction and purification, that could be useful for future research on the organic composition of micropearls.  5.7.

 132 6.1. Abstract Many species of green microalgae within the class Chlorodendrophyceae form intracellular mineral inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) that can be highly enriched in Sr. This suggests that these species may have evolved cellular mechanisms to specifically absorb Sr from their living medium. Stable Sr is naturally present in the environment and shows low toxicity. However, radioactive 90Sr is an artificial unstable isotope produced by nuclear fission that can be released into the environment in the event of a nuclear accident, posing a major health risk. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the unicellular alga Tetraselmis chui (within the class Chlorodendrophyceae) to sequester radioactive 90Sr with a view to applying this organism in new bioremediation techniques targeting this contaminant. Experiments were performed with laboratory cultures of T. chui containing a range of 90Sr concentrations. The assessment of the 90Sr uptake capacity of T. chui cells was performed by following the time evolution of the radioactivity in the culture media using liquid scintillation counting (LSC). Results show the ability of T. chui to effectively sequester 90Sr, proving its potential as a bioremediation agent to treat 90Sr contamination. 6.2. Introduction Radioactive contamination of ecosystems is a major environmental concern that poses a serious risk to wildlife and human health (Sample and Irvine, 2011). The presence of radioisotopes in the environment can be of natural origin (e.g., weathering of U- or Th-rich minerals) or due to human activities such as mining, nuclear reprocessing activities, the detonation of nuclear weapons, and nuclear accidents (Hu et al., 2010; Atwood, 2013). The radionuclide 90Sr is one of the most hazardous anthropogenic isotopes, showing a long half-life of t1/2 = 28.91 years and emitting β radiation (Atwood, 2013). Strontium-90 undergoes β-decay into 90Y (t1/2 = 64.05 hours), which in turn decays by β radiation to 90Zr (stable). Produced by nuclear fission, 90Sr can be released into the environment and bioaccumulate as it easily moves up the food chain (Hoffman et al., 1984). Human exposure to 90Sr occurs from the ingestion of contaminated food and water (Pathak and Gupta, 2020). Due to its similarity to Ca, 90Sr accumulates in bones, Chapter VI  
 133 causing chronic suppression of the immune function, destruction of the hematopoietic bone marrow, leukemia, and cancer (ATSDR, 2004).  Nuclear disasters such as Kyshtym (1957), Chernobyl (1986), and Fukushima (2011), as well as tests of nuclear weapons performed in the past (1945-1980), represent the major source of 90Sr contamination (Pathak and Gupta, 2020). Due to the high mobility of 90Sr, hazardous concentrations of this radionuclide have been detected in soils, sediments, waterbodies, fauna, and flora (Standring et al., 2009; Yablokov et al., 2009).  Traditional physicochemical techniques to remove radionuclides include processes such as precipitation, coagulation, resin ion exchange, solvent extraction, selective adsorption, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and electrokinetic treatment (Kim et al., 2003; ONR, 2020; Pathak and Gupta, 2020). However, these methods have technical limitations and high economic and energy costs. This makes the development of new effective bioremediation techniques highly attractive (Lloyd and Renshaw, 2005; Gadd, 2010; Fukuda et al., 2014; Roh et al., 2015). The species of microalgae Scenedesmus spinosus and Closterium moniliferum have been suggested as potential 90Sr bioremediation agents due to their high capacity to remove stable Sr from their living medium. S. spinosus selectively adsorbs Sr on the cell wall, whereas C. moniliferum sequesters Sr through intracellular precipitation of (Ba,Sr)SO4 crystals (Krejci et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014). Recently, Martignier et al. (2018) showed that many species of green microalgae within the class Chlorodendrophyceae form mineral inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), called micropearls, that can contain high concentrations of natural Sr, which suggests their possible use for 90Sr bioremediation purposes. This finding is particularly interesting because these microalgae live in very diverse aquatic environments and some species such as Tetraselmis suecica and Tetraselmis chui are already mass cultivated as aquaculture feeds (Gladue and Maxey, 1994; Robert et al., 2001; Meseck et al., 2005; Martignier et al., 2020).  A recent study with laboratory cultures showed a high Sr removal from the culture medium by T. chui cells (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022). As expected, this high Sr uptake was related to the intracellular formation of micropearls, supporting the idea of considering micropearl-forming microalgae as potential bioremediation agents targeting Chapter VI  
 134 90Sr contamination. However, evidence proving the suitability of T. chui and other micropearl-forming species for the development of new bioremediation techniques for the removal of 90Sr is lacking. Indeed, its ability to selectively bioaccumulate this radionuclide and to tolerate ionizing radiation has never been studied. Here, we investigated the capacity of the species T. chui to sequester and bioaccumulate radioactive 90Sr in view of its application in the development of new bioremediation techniques. Experiments were performed with laboratory cultures of T. chui amended with a range of 90Sr concentrations going from 3.1x10-12 to 2.7x10-10 M (= 1.4 to 124.2 Bq mL-1). The assessment of the 90Sr uptake capacity of T. chui cells was performed by following the variation over time of the radioactivity of the culture media using liquid scintillation counting (LSC).  6.3. Methods 6.3.1. Strains and culture conditions The strain Tetraselmis chui (SAG 8-6) and Tetraselmis marina (202.80) were obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Göttingen, Germany. Algal growth medium (Fabregas et al., 1984; Pereira et al., 2016) was prepared with sterilized (autoclaved) seawater from the Adriatic Sea (Lido di Jesolo, northeast of Italy). Salinity was adjusted to 20‰ before adding the Algal nutrient solution (1000x concentrated). Natural Sr and Ca concentrations measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) in the culture medium were 9x10-5 and 1.1 x10-2 M, respectively. T. chui was inoculated at a cell density of 2x105 cells mL-1 in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL of Algal medium amended with different concentrations of 90SrCl2: 3.1x10-12, 6.2x10-11, and 2.7x10-10 M (1.4, 28.2, and 124.2 Bq mL-1, respectively). Cultures were set in triplicates and placed for 14 to 15 days at room temperature (RT) on an orbital shaker at 110 rpm and continuous light at 400 lux intensity. Three types of controls were included in the experimental design based on Metha et al. (2019) study. For all the tested 90Sr concentrations, non-inoculated culture media were used as abiotic controls. As an inactivated control, pre-killed T. chui cells (by autoclaving) were resuspended in culture Chapter VI  
 135 media containing 3.1x10-12 and 2.7x10-10 M 90Sr at a cell concentration of 2x105 cells mL-1. Finally, cultures of T. marina (SAG 202.80) amended with 3.1x10-12 M 90Sr were used as biotic controls since this species does not form micropearls and, therefore, is not supposed to bioaccumulate high Sr concentrations. Controls were placed under the culture conditions previously cited for T. chui cultures. 6.3.2. Sampling  Two-mL samples were collected from the cultures and controls every two to four days. One milliliter was used to track algal growth, whereas the remaining volume (1 mL) was used for measuring the radioactivity of culture media and, in some cases, for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observations. 6.3.3. Monitoring of algal growth Cell concentration of the cultures over time was estimated by measuring their optical density at 750 nm (OD750) (Thermo Scientific Genesys 30 spectrophotometer). Prior to the measurements, a correlation between the OD750  and cell density values of T. chui cultures was established by performing cell counting in a Neubauer chamber (Supplementary Information Fig. S1).  Cell concentration (cells mL-1) was calculated as Eq. (1): 	Cell concentration = OD750 x 3.21x106 (1) The biomass dry weight (DW) was also estimated from OD750 after obtaining the corresponding correlation. DW (g L-1) was calculated as Eq. (2):  DW = OD750 X x 7.704 (2) 6.3.4. Monitoring of strontium-90 uptake by T. chui  Strontium-90 uptake by T. chui was followed by measuring the radioactivity of the growth media over time in T. chui cultures using liquid scintillation counting. Chapter VI  
 136 6.3.4.1. Sample preparation One-mL samples of T. chui cultures were centrifuged in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Five hundred µL of the supernatants were accurately weighed using a high precision scale (AX504, Mettler Toledo) and mixed with 15 mL of scintillating solution (Ultima Gold AB, Perkin Elmer) in liquid scintillation vials. The same procedure was followed for control cultures. Samples from cultures amended with 3.1x10-12 M 90Sr (1.4 Bq mL-1) were measured for 2 h using liquid scintillation counting (Packard 2900TR), while cultures amended with 6.2x10-11 and 2.7x10-10 M 90Sr (28.2, and 124.2 Bq mL-1, respectively) were measured for 1 h. Controls were measured in the same way. 6.3.4.2. Calculation of strontium-90 and yttrium-90 efficiencies The efficiency of 3H measurements was already known as a function of the spectral index of external standard (tSIE), but efficiencies for 90Sr and 90Y as a function tSIE had to be calculated. For this purpose, the freeware program CN2003 (E. Günther, PTB) was used to simulate 90Sr and 90Y efficiencies as a function of 3H efficiency. Then, these results along with the tSIE as a function of 3H efficiency allowed to calculate the efficiencies of 90Sr and 90Y as a function of tSIE and apply a fourth-degree polynomic fit for each element.  6.3.4.3. Estimation of the strontium-90 and yttrium-90 activity in the growth medium As previously mentioned, 90Sr decays by β radiation to 90Y, which in turn undergoes β decay into stable 90Zr. Activities of 90Sr and 90Y in the culture medium were estimated based on the liquid scintillation counting. The total counting obtained by liquid scintillation was the sum of the activity of 90Sr and 90Y multiplied by their respective efficiencies as expressed in Eq. (3). 𝑐𝑝𝑠:;:(𝑡)=𝐴<=!"(𝑡)∗𝜀<=!"+	𝐴>!"(𝑡)∗𝜀>!" (3) where 𝑐𝑝𝑠#$#(𝑡) is the total number of counts per second obtained by liquid scintillation counting at time t, 𝐴%&!"(𝑡) and 𝐴'!"(𝑡) (Bq mL-1) the specific activities at time t of 90Sr and 90Y, respectively, and 𝜀%&!" and 𝜀'!" their respective efficiencies.  Chapter VI  
 137 We assumed that the secular equilibrium between 90Sr and 90Y was reached at t = 0 in the cultures. Under this equilibrium condition: 𝐴?>!"=	𝐴?<=!"	 (4) In turn, it is known that the specific activity of a radioelement is expressed as Eq. (5): 𝐴@(𝑡)=	−𝑑𝑁@𝑑𝑡	=𝑁@(𝑡)∗	𝜆@ (5) where 𝐴((t) (Bq mL-1) is the activity of the radioisotope X at time t, 𝑁((𝑡) the number of atoms (atom mL-1) of this radionuclide at time t (s), and 𝜆( (s-1) its decay constant. Therefore, equations (3), (4), and (5) allowed to obtain the initial number of 90Sr atoms (𝑁)%&!").  The Bateman equations account for the number of atoms of a parent and its daughter (in this case, 90Sr and 90Y) as defined by the following equations, respectively:  	𝑑𝑁<=!"(𝑡)𝑑𝑡=−𝜆<=!"∗𝑁<=!"(𝑡) (6)  𝑑𝑁>!"(𝑡)𝑑𝑡=𝜆<=!"∗𝑁<=!"(𝑡)−	𝜆>!"∗𝑁>!"(𝑡) (7) Here, we assume that (i) microalgae only absorb 90Sr and (ii) 90Y produced within the cells is not released into the culture medium. Hence, the decrease of radioactivity observed in the culture medium is mainly due to 90Sr removal by microalgae, happening at a much higher rate than the natural decay rate of this radioelement. Hence, Eq. (6) can be adapted to calculate the number of 90Sr atoms (𝑁%&!") as a function of time as follows: 𝑁<=!"(𝑡)=𝑁?<=!"∗	𝑒AB#$!": (8) where 𝛼 (s-1) is the decay coefficient of 90Sr mainly due to the microalgal uptake of this radioisotope and, to a lesser extent, to the natural decay of 90Sr. By solving the differential Eq. (7), the number of 90Y atoms (𝑁'!") was calculated as a function of time as in Eq. (9). Chapter VI  
 138 𝑁>!"(𝑡)=	𝑁?<=!"	(𝜆<=!"𝜆>!"−	𝜆<=!"𝜆>!"−	𝛼∗	𝑒AC%!"	∗	:+𝜆<=!"𝜆>!"−	𝛼∗	𝑒A	B∗	:) (9) After obtaining 𝑁%&!"(𝑡) and 𝑁'!"(𝑡) values, activities for each element were calculated by applying Eq. (5). 6.3.4.4. Data correction due to evaporation The evaporation effect on the total activity of the culture media was calculated by measuring the total activity of non-inoculated controls over time. For all the tested 90Sr concentrations, the increase of radioactivity due to the evaporation of the culture medium was calculated and subtracted from the data set. 6.3.4.5. Strontium-90 uptake rate estimation Strontium-90 uptake rate (UR) was calculated using the formula applied by Cam et al. (2016) and Segovia-Campos et al. (2022): 𝑈𝑅E=[X]F−[X]E𝐶𝐷::::FE𝑡E−	𝑡F (10) where t is time (h), i and j are two successive measuring times, 𝐶𝐷****	is the average cell density from time i to j, and [X] the concentration of the element X (fmol mL-1). 6.3.5. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) Samples for SEM observation were prepared by gently filtering 20 µL of T. chui cultures with polycarbonate membranes (Whatman® NucleporeTM) of 1-µm pore size. Membranes were dried at RT and placed on Al stubs using a double-sided conductive carbon tape. They were subsequently covered with a layer of 10 nm Au using low vacuum sputter coating. Imaging and EDXS measurements were performed with a JEOL JSM 7001F Scanning Electron Microscope equipped with an EDXS detector (EX-943000S4L1Q; JEOL). Imaging was performed using backscattered electrons. EDXS measurements of micropearls were performed at 15 kV accelerating voltage, a beam current of 7 nA, and an acquisition time of 30 s.

Cell growth and strontium-90 removal  To study 90Sr uptake by T. chui cells, we measured the radioactivity over time of the growth medium of T. chui cultures and controls amended with 3.1x10-12, 6.2x10-11, and 2.7x10-10 M 90Sr (1.4, 28.2, and 124.2 Bq mL-1, respectively) (Fig. 1A-C). We also followed cultures growth over time to determine the influence of cell density in 90Sr removal and, reciprocally, to understand the impact of radioactivity on cultures growth (Fig. 1D-F). As previously mentioned, non-inoculated controls showed an increase in radioactivity over time due to evaporation of the culture medium. We calculated the evaporation rates under each growth condition to remove its effect from our data set.  Radioactivity decreased over time in T. chui cultures under the three growing conditions (Fig. 1A-C). On the other hand, radioactivity in cultures with T. marina cultures (Fig. 2A) and T. chui dead cells (Fig. 3) remained stable over time.  Total activity measured in T. chui cultures amended with 3.1x10-12 M 90Sr (1.4 Bq mL-1) decreased by half after 15 days of growth (from 2.8 to 1.5 ± 0.7 Bq mL-1), reaching an estimated final 90Sr concentration of 1.7x10-12 M 90Sr (0.77 Bq mL-1) (Fig. 1A). Cell density was 8.2x105 ± 1.3x105 cell mL-1 after 15 days of growth (Fig. 1D) and variation between the three replicates was minimal, showing comparable 90Sr removal and culture growth dynamics (Supplementary Information Fig. S2). Strontium-90 removal rate was estimated to be maximum the fourth day of growth with a calculated value of 5.6x10-7 ± 1x10-7 fmol cell-1 day-1 (Fig. 1G). Then, 90Sr removal rate progressively decreased over time. Average 90Sr concentration in the dry biomass was estimated to 5.5x10-2 ± 3.3x10-3 ng g-1. Total radioactivity of T. chui cultures with a 90Sr initial concentration of 6.2x10-11 M (28.2 Bq mL-1) also decreased by 50% after 15 days of growth (from 56 to 27.6 ± 7.3 Bq mL-1), showing an estimated final 90Sr concentration of 2.8x10-11 M (12.8 Bq L-1) (Fig. 1B). Cell concentration after 15 days of growth (7.2x105 ± 1.8 x105 cells mL-1) was not significantly lower than in the previous case (Fig. 1E). However, variation between replicates was higher than in the previous tested condition. Both cell growth and 90Sr removal were significantly higher in triplicate 3 compared to triplicate 1 and 2 (Supplementary Chapter VI  
 140 Information Fig. S4) but 90Sr removal rates were comparable between replicates. The maximum 90Sr removal rate was estimated to 5.4x10-5 ± 6.5x10-6 fmol cell-1 day-1 after one day of growth, and also decreased over time (Fig. 1H). The average 90Sr concentration in T. chui cells was estimated to 1.8 ± 0.3 ng (g dry biomass)-1. Finally, the total activity measured in T. chui cultures amended with 2.7x10-10 M 90Sr (124.2 Bq mL-1), decreased by 30% after 14 days of growth, going from 244.8 to 170.8 ± 51.2 Bq mL-1 (Fig. 1C). The final 90Sr concentration was estimated to 1.95x10-10 M (89.6 Bq mL-1). In this case, variation between replicates was the highest observed, especially from the eighth day of growth onwards. After 14 days of growth, cell density was 5.1x105 ± 2.7x105 cell mL-1 (Fig. 1F). Although culture growth was lower than observed in the two previous cases, this difference was not significant due to the large variation observed between replicates. Indeed, replicate 3 presented a much higher growth rate and 90Sr removal than replicates 1 and 2 (Supplementary Information Fig. S5). The maximum calculated 90Sr removal rate was 5.6x10-5 ± 1.5x10-5 fmol cell-1 day-1, observed during the first two days of growth (Fig. 1I). The average 90Sr concentration in dry biomass was estimated to 6 ± 1.5 ng g-1. For all the tested 90Sr concentrations, calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient showed a strong negative correlation (p<0.0001) between the cell density and the total radioactivity of the cultures, confirming that 90Sr removal is directly dependent on T. chui cell concentration in the cultures (Fig. 1J-L). T. chui cultures amended with 2.7x10-10 M 90Sr showed the most pronounced decrease in radioactivity as a function of cell density. Indeed, by comparing the decay coefficients of the total activity obtained as a function of cell density under the three culture conditions, a correlation was also detected between the decay coefficients and the initial 90Sr concentrations added in the cultures (Fig. 4).

SEM imaging and EDXS analysis of micropearl composition T. chui cells grown for four days in a culture amended with 3.1x10-12 M 90Sr (1.4 Bq mL-1) were observed using SEM to detect any possible abnormality in cells morphology and in 
Chapter VI  
 144 the micropearl formation process due to b radiation (Fig. 5). At this 90Sr concentration, cells did not present any alteration. Indeed, several cells were in the dividing stage and micropearls were present. The size and shape of the micropearls corresponded to what had been observed in previous studies (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a). By performing EDXS analysis in micropearls, we obtained their Sr/Ca mol% ratios. The average value was 0.32 ± 0.09 (n = 18). To prevent the contamination of the instrument, we avoided analyzing culture samples with higher 90Sr concentrations.

Micropearls appear as bright white inclusions (< 1µm) in the anterior part of each daughter cell. Black dots correspond to the pores of the membrane used to prepare the sample.  6.5. Discussion 6.5.1. Strontium-90 uptake by T. chui cells Previous studies showed that the uptake of stable Sr by T. chui was related to micropearl formation, this alkaline earth metal being incorporated in these mineral inclusions (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022). In this study, we show that T. chui can also sequester radioactive 90Sr from a culture medium mostly composed of seawater. In addition, we show that, unlike living T. chui cells, T. marina (not-forming-micropearls species) and dead T. chui cells do not retain 90Sr. This finding indicates that, as expected, 90Sr removal by T. chui is due to its active uptake for micropearl formation, suggesting that other 
Chapter VI  
 145 micropearl-forming species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae may also sequester 90Sr.  Here, we show that 90Sr removal from the culture medium clearly depends on T. chui cell density as well as on the initial 90Sr concentration of the culture medium. Higher concentrations of 90Sr in the growth medium result in higher absorption rates by T. chui cells and higher estimated 90Sr concentrations in its dry biomass. Indeed, the total radioactivity decay coefficient is proportional to the initial concentration of 90Sr in the cultures. Further research would be needed to determine the maximum 90Sr uptake capacity of T. chui. In a previous study, the concentration of stable Sr measured in T. chui dry biomass obtained from cultures enhanced with 1x10-4 M of stable Sr and 2.5x10-3 M Ca was 15 mg (g DW)-1 (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022). In our experiments, the initial concentration of Sr in the culture medium was similar (9x10-5 M Sr), whereas Ca concentration was higher (1.1x10-2 M). Despite this difference in the culture medium composition, Sr/Ca mol% ratios measured in T. chui micropearls are comparable in both studies, although slightly lower in our study (0.32 ± 0.09 (present study) vs 0.42 ± 0.1 (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022). By assuming that 15 mg (g DW)-1 is the expected concentration of stable Sr in T. chui biomass produced in the present study, the estimated 90Sr/(stable Sr) ratios in the biomass and in the culture media would be similar, suggesting that the Sr uptake system of this microalga is not able to discern between stable Sr and radioactive 90Sr. Nevertheless, analysis of the isotopic composition of T. chui biomass is needed to confirm there is no Sr isotopic fractionation linked to Sr uptake. 6.5.2. Effect of strontium-90 on T. chui growth Although cultures amended with high concentrations of 90Sr show higher removal rates, we also show differences in the growth dynamics between the different tested conditions. With the lowest 90Sr concentration (3.1x10-12 M = 28.2 Bq mL-1), variation between replicates is low, with all cultures reaching cell densities higher than 6.5x105 cells mL-1 after 15 days of growth (Fig 1A, D). However, the variability between replicates increases as higher 90Sr concentrations are tested. While some replicates grow normally, others show altered growth, especially with the highest tested concentration of Chapter VI  
 146 radioactive 90Sr (3.1x10-12 M). At these concentrations, b radiation may alter microalgal cell viability. It has been shown that 90Sr and 90Y can affect plants, triggering growth abnormalities, as well as decreasing grain production and seed viability (Schulz and Baldar, 1972; Van Hoeck et al., 2015). On the other hand, a study where the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris was grown with 200 and 2000 Bq mL-1 90Sr showed that its growth was not altered at these concentrations (Lee et al., 2014). However, in this study most of the 90Sr did not penetrate the cells but was deposited on the cell wall, forming carbonates. Hence, it is conceivable that the intracellular accumulation of 90Sr in micropearls could cause further damage to the cell due to the delivery of higher b radiation doses within the cells. Unfortunately, the effect of radiation on microalgae has barely been studied in the past. In a study where the 90Sr uptake by the cyanobacterium Gloeomargarita lithophora (forming similar Sr-rich intracellular ACC inclusions) was followed, an allusion to a possible toxic effect on cultures growth with 8.8x10-11 M 90Sr was made (Mehta et al., 2019). In plants, it is known that ionization events can trigger the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing damage to proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and DNA (Gill and Tuteja, 2010; Van Hoeck et al., 2015). Although we observe a possible alteration of T. chui cell growth due to high concentrations of 90Sr in the medium, it is important to note that the lowest concentration of 90Sr tested in this study best corresponds to actual levels of contamination in aquatic environments (except for cases of extreme contamination such as the one observed in Lake Karachay, Russia) (Tab. 1).  Due to the nature of the experiments presented in this study, T. chui cultures were set up in a laboratory adapted to the handling of radioactive materials, whose conditions were not optimal for microalgal cultivation. This may also have influenced culture growth and increased variability among replicates. Altogether, the fact that some replicates of T. chui cultures grew even with high 90Sr concentrations in the medium is a promising result as it demonstrates that this species can accommodate high levels of ionizing radiation.  Chapter VI  
 147  Table 1: Strontium-90 contamination measured in aquatic environments after major nuclear incidents. 6.5.3. T. chui as a strontium-90 bioremediation agent While the maximum T. chui cell densities presented here are lower than 1x106 cells mL-1, it has been shown that T. chui cell density can reach values higher than 3.2x106 cells mL-1 when the culture conditions are optimized (Mohammadi et al., 2015). Since the present study demonstrates that 90Sr removal is directly related to T. chui cell concentration in the cultures, we expect to obtain a higher 90Sr removal in cultures where cell growth is improved. Indeed, for all the 90Sr concentrations tested in this study, T. chui cultures reaching a cell density of about 1.5x106 cells mL-1 would be enough to remove more than 95% of the initially dissolved 90Sr.  The use of species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae for the development of new techniques for 90Sr decontamination presents several advantages compared to the use of other organisms suggested for this purpose in the past (such as plants (Eapen et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2008), cyanobacteria (Pohl and Schimmack, 2006; Mehta et al., 2019), and bacteria (Achal et al., 2012; Kang et al., 2014)). As previously mentioned, Sr absorption by Chlorodendrophyceae species has been associated with their ability to form micropearls (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022a). This capacity is shared by species living in very different habitats, including hypersaline water, seawater, brackish water, and freshwater (Martignier et al., 2018; Martignier et al., 2020; Segovia-Campos et al., 2022b). More likely, species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae can be used for 90Sr remediation in very diverse aquatic environments.

 148 also show high growth performances in a wide range of salinities and light intensities, which further increases their field of action (Meseck et al., 2005; Mohammadi et al., 2015; Ishika et al., 2018; Trovão et al., 2019). Moreover, these species can be highly resistant to bacteria and cyanobacteria contamination, which is an essential requirement for these organisms to be used for the treatment of non-sterile water (Meseck et al., 2007; Biondi et al., 2017; Schulze et al., 2017). Another advantage of using these microalgae over other types of organisms is their rapid growth and the low energy cost associated with their production since natural sunlight can be used as the main source of energy for growth. Indeed, microalgae within the genus Tetraselmis are already largely produced in mass culture systems for aquaculture purposes as well as for biodiesel production, CO2 mitigation, and wastewater treatment (Pérez-Rama et al., 2002; Bondioli et al., 2012; Moheimani, 2016; Pereira et al., 2018). Currently, several outdoor infrastructures (photobioreactors) for large-scale production of Tetraselmis (including T. chui) already exist and could serve as a basis for the future development of ex-situ Tetraselmis-based 90Sr decontamination systems (Pereira et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2021). Future studies optimizing the growth of these algae in the presence of 90Sr will be essential for the development of bioremediation systems based on these microorganisms. 6.6. Conclusions Although the use of micropearl forming species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae had been suggested for the development of new bioremediation techniques related to 90Sr contamination, their ability to absorb this radioisotope had never been demonstrated in the past. This study shows for the first time the ability of Tetraselmis chui to sequester radioactive 90Sr from a culture medium mainly composed of seawater, this capacity being related to the intracellular formation of micropearls.  Strontium-90 removal depends on T. chui cell density in the cultures: the higher the cell density, the higher the 90Sr removal from the medium. In addition, the removal capacity of these microorganisms is correlated to initial 90Sr concentrations in the medium.  Chapter VI  
 149 Cell growth is not affected at 90Sr concentrations of 3.1x10-12 M (1.4 Bq L-1). However, we see a heterogeneous effect on T. chui cultures growth containing higher 90Sr concentrations that may be related to high levels of ionizing radiation in the cultures.  Altogether, our results clearly support the possibility of achieving a complete 90Sr removal if T. chui growth is optimized. These results are highly relevant as T. chui is a robust species, easily cultivated on a large scale and, therefore, particularly attractive for the development of new bioremediation techniques. Since 90Sr uptake is related to micropearl formation, it is likely that other micropearl-forming species could be used for the same purpose. 6.7. References Achal, V., Pan, X., and Zhang, D.

 158 7.1. Abstract Green microalgae within the class Chlorodendrophyceae have recently attracted researchers’ interest due to their capacity to form micropearls (intracellular inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC)) highly enriched in Sr. The species Tetraselmis chui (included in the class Chlorodendrophyceae) shows a high uptake of both stable and radioactive Sr isotopes and has been suggested as a potential candidate for the development of new bioremediation regarding radioactive 90Sr contamination. In this study, we optimized Tetraselmis chui growth in 1-L bubble column photobioreactors (PBRs) with and without CO2 supply in order to maximize Sr removal by this organism. Results show that growing T. chui in bubble column PBRs largely improves cell production and Sr removal compared to previous studies. Moreover, the addition of 10 mL L-1 h-1 CO2 can further accelerate T. chui growth and promote Sr absorption. Thus, this study presents promising results for the development of new bioremediation methods to treat 90Sr contamination. 7.2. Introduction Strontium is an alkaline earth metal whose stable isotopes (86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr) are naturally present with low toxicity in the environment (Pathak and Gupta, 2020). However, it has been shown that the ingestion of high doses of natural Sr for an extended period can trigger a rare disorder called Urov disease, which mainly affects bones growth and calcification, especially in children (Sutton et al., 1971; ATSDR, 2004; Health Canada, 2018). The occurrence of high concentrations of stable Sr in surface and undergrown water is due to rocks and soil weathering, as well as to anthropogenic activities such as mining (Pathak and Gupta, 2020; Musgrove, 2021). Since the main Sr uptake sources in humans and animals are drinking water and food (such as crops and milk), some countries have regulated the natural Sr content in drinking water. For instance, the maximum Sr concentration recommended in drinking water has been set to 4 mg L-1 (0.05 mM) in the U.S. (ATSDR, 2004) and 7 mg L-1 (0.08 mM) in Canada (Health Canada, 2018). In Europe, no limit has yet been established. Nevertheless, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety suggested in 2012 a provisional Chapter VII 
 159 maximum concentration of 18 mg L-1 (0.21 mM) in drinking water and concluded that long-term studies about the Sr-toxicity are needed to establish a toxicological reference value (ANSES, 2012). On the other hand, 90Sr is an artificial radioactive isotope produced by fission in nuclear reactors. This radionuclide presents a half-life of 28.9 years and emits ß rays (Hu et al., 2010; Pathak and Gupta, 2020). It has been released into the environment due to military nuclear weapons tests, effluent discharges from nuclear power plants, liquid effluents from fuel reprocessing plants, and power plant accidents such as Chernobyl or Fukushima (UNSCEAR, 2000). Strontium-90 is also produced for its use in medicine and industry (ATSDR, 2004). Oral exposure to this isotope can cause 90Sr accumulation in vertebrates’ bones, leading to severe health problems in humans, including the destruction of the hematopoietic bone marrow, leukemia, and cancer (ATSDR, 2004; Höllriegl and München, 2011). Harmful concentrations of 90Sr have been detected in the sea, rivers, and aquifers (De Cort, 1998; Kryshev et al., 1998; Freed et al., 2004; Casacuberta et al., 2013). The United States Environmental Protection Agency established a maximum 90Sr concentration in drinking water of 0.3 Bq L-1 (ATSDR, 2004). The traditionally applied methods to reduce stable and radioactive Sr concentrations in water are analogous to those for Ca, including techniques such as clarification or sedimentation, selective adsorption, ion exchange, nanofiltration, and reverse osmosis (Marinin and Brown, 2000; Baeza et al., 2004; Parks and Edwards, 2006; ANSES, 2012; ONR, 2020). These techniques have high economic and energetic costs and can present serious effectiveness limitations in cases of extensive contamination (ONR, 2020). Therefore, there is a need to develop efficient and alternative sustainable remediation methods. Interest in developing new 90Sr bioremediation techniques involving the use of microalgae has increased in recent years. For instance, the green algae Closterium moniliferum and Scenedesmus spinosus have been suggested as possible bioremediation agents to treat 90Sr contamination due to their ability to sequester natural Sr (Krejci et al., 2011a; Krejci et al., 2011b; Potera, 2011; Liu et al., 2014). Recently, most of the species within the class of green microalgae Chlorodendrophyceae have also been shown to present high Sr uptake capacities (Martignier et al., 2018; Martignier et al., 2020; Chapter VII 
 160 Segovia-Campos et al., 2021). Strontium is accumulated in intracellular mineral inclusions of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) that are called micropearls. Microalgae within this class are widespread organisms that can live in diverse aquatic environments, including hypersaline water, seawater, brackish water, and freshwater (Fabregas et al., 1984; Martignier et al., 2018). Species within the genus Tetraselmis (included in the class Chlorodendrophyceae), especially Tetraselmis suecica, are easily cultivated in large-scale photobioreactors and have received an increased interest regarding their application for wastewater treatment, CO2 mitigation, heavy metal bioremediation, as well as to produce biofuel and high-value products (carotenoids, antioxidants, etc.) (Pérez-Rama et al., 2002; Zittelli et al., 2006; Bondioli et al., 2012; Michels et al., 2014; Kassim and Meng, 2017; Schulze et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2018; Schüler et al., 2020). However, despite its potential application for bioremediation purposes, their ability to form mineral inclusions of ACC highly enriched in Sr has been overlooked in the past (Martignier et al., 2018; Segovia-Campos et al., 2021). Tetraselmis chui is a species phylogenetically close to T. suecica, both included in the same clade and showing similar biomineralization patterns (Gonzalez et al., 2015; Martignier et al., 2020; Hyung et al., 2021). Although T. chui is largely produced as an aquaculture feed (Wikfors et al., 1996; Meseck et al., 2005), its application for bioremediation purposes has been little explored.   Strontium uptake by T. chui has recently been studied in small-scale laboratory cultures, using a growth medium prepared with synthetic seawater enriched with stable Sr (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022). This study showed that T. chui presents a high Sr uptake which is related to the micropearl formation process and produces a significant decrease of the element concentration in the culture medium after a few days. However, the initial Sr concentrations in the culture medium only decreased by half after two weeks of growth, suggesting that the culture method could probably be optimized to obtain a higher Sr removal. A parallel study also showed the high capacity of T. chui to sequester radioactive 90Sr, proving the high potential of this species to be used as a bioremediation agent regarding 90Sr water contamination (Chapter VI). Nevertheless, the complete removal of 90Sr from the culture medium was not achieved as, again, T. chui growth was not optimized. It is therefore desirable to develop culture methods that optimize T. chui growth and Sr uptake with a view to using this organism for bioremediation purposes. Chapter VII 
 161 Bubble columns are versatile photobioreactors (PBRs) that provide controlled environmental conditions to achieve optimal microalgal growth on a wide range of production scales (Posten, 2009). The design of this type of PBR allows a better light delivery into the cultures compared to traditional Erlenmeyer cultures. Moreover, aeration is provided from the bottom, which allows a good mixing of the cultures, reducing the formation of pH, nutrients, and temperature gradients, and preventing cell sedimentation (Ugwu et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2017). This aeration system also allows CO2 injections into liquid cultures, which can improve microalgal production since CO2 is the carbon source of photoautotrophic organisms (Huang et al., 2017).  The present work aimed to optimize T. chui cultures to obtain a higher Sr removal from the culture medium using 1-L bubble column PBRs. Cultures were amended with different concentrations of stable Sr and, in some cases, also enhanced with CO2. 7.3. Methods This study includes two sets of experiments: (A) testing T. chui growth and Sr absorption in bubble column PBRs with different Sr concentrations and (B) testing the effect of CO2 in T. chui growth and Sr uptake (also using bubble column PBRs). The algal strain studied, Tetraselmis chui (8-6), was obtained from the Culture Collection of Algae of the University of Göttingen (SAG).   7.3.1. Experiments A: setup and procedure T. chui was grown in Algal growth medium (Fabregas et al., 1984; Pereira et al., 2016) that was prepared with sterile seawater from the Atlantic coast of South Portugal. Salinity was adjusted to 20‰ before adding the concentrated (1000x) Algal nutrient solution. Cells were transferred from the original agar culture to 60 mL of Algal medium in Erlenmeyer flasks. Cultures were placed for seven days in an incubator (Multitron Standard-Infors HT) at 20°C with continuous light at 1,700 lux intensity and 110 rpm shaking. They were then transferred to 300 mL of liquid culture medium in 1-L Erlenmeyer flasks that were placed back in the incubator. After one week, cultures were finally transferred into 1-L bubble column PBRs along with fresh culture medium to reach a total culture volume of 1 L. Each Chapter VII 
 162 culture was grown for one week and was then sufficient to inoculate three new PBRs to start the experiments. Photobioreactors were exposed to continuous light at 2,000 lux intensity and aerated with 0.2-µm-filtered air at a flow rate of 80 mL min-1. T. chui cultures were enhanced with different concentrations of SrCl2·6H2O: 0.04, 0.4, and 0.8 mM. For each growth condition, cultures were grown in duplicates for one week (Fig. 1A). Twenty-five-milliliters samples of each T. chui culture were collected after 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of growth. One mL of the sample was used to measure the optical density of the culture, 10 mL to measure its dry weight (DW), and another 10 mL for chemical analysis.  7.3.2. Experiments B: setup and procedure In this case, the Algal growth medium was prepared with commercial sea salt from the Red Sea (Red Sea). Salinity was adjusted to 30‰ and the scaling-up was performed as indicated for the set of experiments A. Photobioreactors were also exposed to continuous light at 2,000 lux intensity and aerated with 0.2-µm-filtered air at a flow rate of 80 mL min-1. For this set of experiments, T. chui cultures were enhanced with 0.5 mM SrCl2·6H2O, and the effect of CO2 enhancement on cell growth and the Sr absorption capacity of T. chui cells was tested by adding 10 mL L-1 h-1 (20 mg L-1 h-1) CO2 in some of the cultures. Cultures were set in triplicates and grown for one week (Fig. 1B). Non-inoculated bubble column PBRs were also set in triplicates under the same culture conditions as controls. Twenty-five-milliliters samples were collected every day from each culture (including controls) for one week and processed as previously mentioned. In addition, their pH was also measured. The remaining volume was used for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) analysis. Chapter VII 
 163  Figure 1: Tetraselmis chui culture set-up in 1-L bubble column photobioreactors. (A) Culture set-up for experiments A. Cultures were performed in duplicates with initial Sr concentrations of 0.04, 0.4 and 0.8 mM. (B) Culture set-up for experiments B. Cultures were set in triplicates with an initial concentration of 0.5 mM Sr, with and without CO2 enhancement (10 mL L-1 h-1 CO2). 7.3.3. Cell growth and pH measurements Cell growth was monitored by measuring both the optical density (OD) and the dry weight (DW) of the cultures. The OD was determined by measuring in triplicate the absorbance of 200-µL samples using a Biotek Synergy 4 (experiments A) or a Biotek Synergy HT (experiments B) microplate reader at a wavelength of 750 nm. Dry weight was determined by filtering 10-mL culture samples in previously weighed 0.7-µm glass microfiber filters (VWR). After filtration, filters were washed with 10 mL NH4HCO2 (35 g L-1) and dried for 48 h at 60 °C using a laboratory oven. Finally, filters were weighted using an analytical balance. Optical density and dry weight values were used to estimate the cell concentration of the cultures since a correlation between both parameters and cell density was previously established after cell counting in a hemocytometer. The pH of the cultures was measured in 2-mL samples using a Mettler Toledo Seven2GoTM Pro pH meter (Mettler Toledo) in experiments B. 
Chapter VII 
 164 7.3.4. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) T. chui cell samples for SEM observation and EDXS analysis were prepared by gently filtering 200 µL of the cultures with 1-µm pore size polycarbonate membranes (Whatman® NucleporeTM) using a manual vacuum pump. Membranes were subsequently dried at room temperature, mounted on Al stubs using a double-sided carbon tape, and coated with a 10 nm Au layer by low vacuum pressure sputtering (Leica EM SCD 500). Samples were imaged and analyzed with a JEOL JSM 70001F scanning electron microscope with a coupled EDXS detector (model EX-94300054L1Q, JEOL). Images were obtained using the detection of backscattered electrons. EDXS analysis was performed using a beam current of 7 nA, an accelerating voltage of 15 kV, and an acquisition time of 30 s. Micropearl length measurements were performed using the software ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012).  7.3.5. Strontium concentration measurements The Sr concentration in the culture medium and T. chui biomass was measured using Microwave Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (Agilent Technologies 4200 MP-AES, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (experiments A) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (Agilent Technologies ICP-MS 7700x, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (experiments B). Several control samples were previously analyzed in both instruments to ensure that they provide comparable results. Samples for MP-AES analysis (experiments A) were prepared based on the protocol presented in Segovia-Campos et al. (2022). Ten milliliters of the culture samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm in 15-mL sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes (Falcon®). The supernatants were transferred to new sterile tubes, stabilized with the addition of 0.2 mL 65% HNO3, and stored at 4 °C for further analyses. Algae pellets were transferred to 2-mL Eppendorf tubes and rinsed by resuspending the pellets in 1 mL of a solution containing Milli-Q water, 15 mM TRIS-HCl, and 0.1 M NaCl at pH 8.2. To remove the rinsing solution, the Eppendorf tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm and the supernatant was discarded. The rinsing process was repeated twice. Wet pellets were Chapter VII 
 165 digested with 320 µL 65% HNO3 and 80 µL 30% H2O2 at 100 °C for 45 min. Digested biomass solutions were then diluted 100 times in 2% HNO3. The calibration of the instrument was performed over a range of Sr concentrations from 0 to 10 mg L-1 in a 5% HNO3 matrix. Strontium measurements were performed at wavelengths 407.771 and 460.733 nm. Samples for ICP-MS analysis (experiments B) were prepared in a similar way. Supernatants were collected, stabilized, and stored as previously mentioned. Algae pellets were transferred to 2-mL Eppendorf tubes and rinsed by resuspending the pellets in 1 mL of a solution containing Milli-Q water, 0.1 M NaCl, and 2 mM HEPES at pH 8.2. Eppendorf tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm and the supernatant was discarded. The rinsing process was repeated twice before freeze-drying (Alpha 2-4, Christ) the biomass for 24 h. Lyophilized pellets, as well as three samples of Certified Reference Material (CRM) No. 3 Chlorella (National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan), were accurately weighed and digested with 320 µL 65% HNO3 and 80 µL 30% H2O2 at 100 °C during 45 min. Before starting ICP-MS analysis, the digestion mixtures of T. chui cells and CRM samples were diluted 600 and 80 times, respectively, in 2% HNO3. Culture medium samples and the CRM Sea Water (High-purity standards) were diluted 100 times in 2% HNO3. Samples were analyzed with the ICP-MS coupled with an ASX-500 Series autosampler. Strontium calibration was performed over a range of concentrations from 0 to 1 mg L-1. Isotopes 87Sr and 88Sr were measured using No Gaz, Helium, and High Energy Helium modes. During the entire analysis process, an internal standard solution containing 50 µg L-1 Re and 50 µg L-1 Rh was injected into the instrument to detect any plasma fluctuation. Accuracies for Sr concentrations measured in CRM samples ranged between 90 and 110% with a degree of precision (RSD) below 10%. 7.3.6. Calculation of strontium uptake rates Strontium uptake rate was calculated as Cam et al. (2016) and Segovia-Campos et al. (2022): 𝑈𝑅!=[X]"−[X]!𝐶𝐷****"!𝑡!−	𝑡"	 Chapter VII 
 166 where t is time (in h), i and j two successive measurement times, [X] the concentration of the element X (in fmol L-1) in the culture medium, 𝐶𝐷**** the average cell density between times i and j (in cell L-1).  7.3.7. Statistical treatment Micropearl length and Sr/Ca mol% ratios were compared between T. chui cells grown with and without CO2 enhancement by performing statistical tests. Micropearl length was compared using the unpaired t-test, while Sr/Ca mol% ratios were compared with the unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction (as variances were significantly different between the two compared groups). In both cases, we previously applied the Shapiro–Wilk statistical test to confirm the normal distribution of the dataset. These statistical tests were performed using the software GraphPad Prism 8 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA). 7.4. Results 7.4.1. Cell growth The growth of T. chui cultures was followed with the different Sr concentrations (experiments A) as well as with and without CO2 (experiments B) in bubble column PBRs. After seven days of growth, the cell density reached values higher than 2.4x106 cells mL-1 in all the cultures, regardless of the different culture conditions (Fig. 2A-C and 3A).  Cultures grown with natural seawater enhanced with 0, 0.4, and 0.8 mM Sr showed comparable growth patterns and specific growth rates (Fig. 2A-D). Cultures grew exponentially during the first three days and continued growing at a slower rate from day 3 to day 7 (Fig. 2A-C, D).  After one week of growth, the cell density of the cultures was 3.0x106 ± 0.4x106 cells mL-1.  On the other hand, cultures grown with 0.5 mM Sr with and without CO2 showed different growth trends (Fig. 3A, B): while cultures without CO2 supply showed a cell density of 2.4x106 ± 0.4x106 cell mL-1, the cell density in cultures supplemented with CO2 was significantly higher, reaching 3.7x106 ± 0.8 x106 cell mL-1.

After seven days of growth, T. chui cultures with an initial Sr concentration of 0.04 (= non-added Sr), 0.4, and 0.8 mM Sr, showed an Sr removal of 100, 94, and 72%, respectively (Fig. 2A-C). T. chui cultures enhanced with 0.5 mM Sr without CO2 supply showed an Sr removal of 81% after seven days, while 97% of the initial Sr concentration 
Chapter VII 
 168 was already absorbed by T. chui after four days of growth in cultures supplemented with CO2 (Fig. 3A). Maximum Sr absorption rates were observed after one day of growth in cultures without added Sr (1.2 ± 0.0 fmol cell-1 h-1) as well as in cultures supplemented with 0.4 mM Sr (2.6 ± 0.4 fmol cell-1 h-1) (Fig. 2E). Cultures enhanced with 0.8 mM Sr, showed their maximum Sr uptake rate after three days of growth (3.3 ± 0.3 fmol cell-1 h-1). Culture grown with 0.5 mM Sr, with and without CO2, showed maximum Sr absorption rates after one day of growth (Fig. 3C). However, the Sr uptake rate in cultures enhanced with CO2 was higher than that of cultures without CO2 injections during the first three days of growth. Analysis of the dissolved Sr in control cultures amended with 0.5 mM Sr with and without CO2 input showed a slight increase over time of the Sr concentration in the culture medium probably related to evaporation (Fig. S1A, Supporting Information). Chemical analysis of T. chui cells showed that Sr constituted up to 2% of the total dry biomass after three to five days of growth in cultures enhanced with 0.4 and 0.8 mM Sr (Fig. 2F). Dry biomass of cultures enhanced with 0.5 mM Sr without CO2 supply showed a maximum Sr concentration of 1.9% after seven days of growth, while the dry biomass of cultures supplemented with 0.5 mM Sr and CO2 showed a maximum Sr concentration of 2.1% after only two days of growth (Fig. 3D). However, in the latter case, from day 2 to day 7, the Sr concentration of the dry biomass gradually decreased until it reached a value of 1.3%. Chapter VII

 170 acidification over time: the pH ranged from 8.2 (t = 0 days) to 6.9 (t = 7 days), and a strong decrease was observed between day 3 and 4 (from pH 7.8 to 7). The pH of cultures without CO2 injections increased from 8.2 to 9.5 during the first day of growth and then slightly decreased over time, reaching a pH of 8.7 after one week of growth. The pH of control cultures without CO2 slightly decreased during the first day, going from 8.2 to 7.9, and then remained stable (Fig. S1B, Supporting Information). Control cultures with pH supply showed a stronger acidification during the first two days, from pH 8.2 to 6.9. Then, pH increased to 7.4 and remained stable over time. 7.4.4. Effect CO2 supplementation in micropearl formation SEM observation of T. chui cells revealed a difference in micropearl size between cultures grown with and without CO2 (Fig. 4A). After three days of growth, T. chui cells cultured with CO2 supply, presented micropearls 18% larger than those observed in cells cultured without CO2 addition (p<0.0001, n>108). Analysis of the chemical composition using EDXS, also showed a difference between the Sr/Ca mol% ratio in micropearls between the two conditions, being higher in cultures with CO2 supply (p=0.02, n=25).

Discussion 7.5.1. Optimization of the culture growth: a key strategy for strontium removal A recent study where T. chui was cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks with synthetic seawater showed that 50% of the initial Sr concentration of the cultures was absorbed by T. chui cells after six to nine days of growth (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022) (Tab. 1). The present study shows that Sr removal by T. chui cells can be drastically improved by growing these

 172 organisms in bubble column PBRs with a culture medium containing either natural seawater or natural sea salt. Although Sr concentrations in T. chui dry biomass obtained from cultures enriched with 0.5 mM Sr (without CO2 supply) are similar in both studies (1.7 ± 0.2% vs 1.9 ± 0.2%), the cell density in bubble column PBRs is twice the one obtained in the study previously cited (Tab. 1).

As mentioned before, bubble column PBRs are culture systems that provide a high algal production. However, this is not the only parameter playing an important role in culture growth. Other Tetraselmis species such as T. suecica have been proved to show optimal growth in cultures where the growth medium is prepared with natural seawater instead of synthetic seawater (Azma et al., 2011). Thus, the use of Algal medium prepared either with natural seawater or with natural Red Sea salt has probably improved cultures growth compared to the previously cited work (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022). From a bioremediation perspective, the fact that T. chui cultures show higher cell densities in a culture medium mainly composed of natural seawater or natural sea salt is a promising result as it indicates its potential use for contaminated seawater treatment. 7.5.2. CO2 enhancement and pH Our study also shows a higher cell density in T. chui cultures supplemented with 20 mg L-1 h-1 (10 mL L-1 h-1) CO2 (Fig. 3A), leading to higher Sr removal efficiencies during the first days of growth compared to cultures without CO2 supply (97% vs 51% in 4-days-old Chapter VII 
 173 cultures with a Sr initial concentration of 0.5 mM). Indeed, due to the physicochemical properties of CO2 in seawater and freshwater, CO2 diffusion from air to water is low. In addition, less than 1% of dissolved inorganic carbon is as CO2(aq) at pH 8, whereas 90% is present as HCO3- (due to the carbonate equilibria) (Huang et al., 2017). Hence, to avoid limiting cell growth and productivity in microalgal cultures, it has been shown that CO2 must be supplied in the cultures at a partial pressure higher than 0.2 kPa (3.3 mg L-1) (Posten, 2009; Acién et al., 2017), which explains the higher cell densities observed in our study. Nevertheless, we also observe a clear CO2-induced acidification of the cultures (Fig. 3E). In addition to the CO2 supply, the pH is another essential parameter to consider in microalgal cultivation systems as low and high pH can have inhibitory effects on microalgae growth (Khatoon et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2017; Kassim and Meng, 2017). The optimal growth of different Tetraselmis strains has been shown to occur at pH 6.5-8.5 (Moheimani, 2013; Khatoon et al., 2014; Pereira et al., 2018). In our study, pH of cultures with CO2 supply decreased from 8.2 to 7 after seven days of growth, while pH of cultures without CO2 supply increased to 9.5. This observation could also explain the higher cell densities observed in T. chui cultures with CO2 supply since the pH of these cultures ranged between the optimal values for Tetraselmis cell growth (Fig. 3A). However, it has also been shown that a pH below 7.5 can affect calcium carbonate biomineralization in several calcifying microorganisms, such as the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (Moheimani and Borowitzka, 2011). This alteration in the biomineralization seems to be due to the closure of voltage-regulated H+ channels, directly related to calcification and pH homeostasis (Suffrian et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2011; von Dassow, 2022). Interestingly, we observe an increase in Sr concentration in the culture medium (Fig. 3A) and a decrease in its concentration in T. chui cells after four days of culture with CO2 (Fig. 3D), coinciding with an abrupt drop of the pH of the cultures (from pH 7.8 to pH 7.0) (Fig. 3E). This observation seems to indicate that the micropearl formation process can also be affected by a culture pH below 7.5 (Fig. 5C).  On the other hand, as previously mentioned, the pH of cultures without CO2 injections significantly increased after one day of growth (Fig. 3E), reaching pH values of 9.5. At this pH, the growth of other species within the genus Tetraselmis is strongly affected (Khatoon et al., 2014). Therefore, T. chui growth in cultures without CO2 supply could also Chapter VII 
 174 have been limited because of a high pH. Indeed, the alkalinization of the medium is due to the photosynthetic activity of microalgae, as a result of: i) CO2 uptake from the bicarbonate-carbonate buffer system (CO2 + H2O « H+ + HCO3- « 2H+ + CO32-), driving the equilibrium to the left and, therefore, increasing the proton consumption, and/or ii) HCO3- uptake followed by the conversion into CO2 and OH- by the carbonic anhydrase in the intracellular space, with concurrent OH- efflux to the extracellular medium (Borowitzka, 1982; Moheimani and Borowitzka, 2011) (Fig. 5A). Hence, the addition of CO2 into the cultures not only represents a major source of inorganic carbon available for photosynthesis but also contributes to maintaining an optimal pH for cell growth (when its addition is controlled to avoid over-acidification of the cultures). Although cultures without CO2 enhancement showed a lower cell production than cultures supplemented with CO2, the final cell density, as well as the Sr removal efficiency, were, nevertheless, high under these culture conditions, proving a high pH tolerance of T. chui. 7.5.3. CO2 supply and micropearl formation Surprisingly, T. chui cells grown with 0.5 mM Sr showed higher Sr uptake rates during the first two to three days of growth with CO2 supply compared to cultures without CO2 addition (Fig. 3C). The Sr content of the dry biomass was also higher when CO2 was added in the cultures (Fig. 3D). SEM observation of T. chui cells cultured for three days with 0.5 mM Sr showed that micropearls were 18% larger in cells grown with CO2 supply compared to those observed in cultures without CO2 (Fig. 4). Altogether, these observations suggest that CO2 enhancement can favor micropearl formation at pH 7.5 or higher. Since the addition of CO2 into the culture medium can shift the bicarbonate-carbonate buffer equilibrium to the right, there should be an increase of HCO3- in the system, favoring its uptake by T. chui cells for the intracellular formation of (Ca,Sr)CO3 (Fig. 5B). This would explain a greater absorption of Sr for micropearl formation. Hence, at pH 7.5 or higher, CO2 supply in T. chui cultures enhances cell growth and promotes Sr absorption by T. chui cells, resulting in higher Sr removal efficiencies compared to cultures without CO2 enhancement.    Chapter VII 
 175  Figure 5: Simplified outline of CO2, HCO3-, Ca2+, Sr2+, and H+ pathways possibly associated with micropearl formation in T. chui under different growth conditions. (A) Without CO2 supply, the pH of the culture medium increases due to the CO2 consumption related to photosynthesis, shifting the carbonate equilibrium of the culture medium to the left. At his pH, HCO3- is the main C source for both micropearl formation and photosynthesis (through the conversion to CO2 by the carbonic anhydrase (CA), producing OH-). The formation of (Ca,Sr)CO3 produces H+ that might be transported extracellularly to avoid the acidification of the cytoplasm or, alternatively, neutralized with the produced OH- in the cytoplasm. (B) The addition of 10 mL L-1 h-1 CO2 for a short period of time shifts the carbonate equilibrium to the right, increasing HCO3- and H+ concentration in the culture medium and decreasing the pH. Added CO2 can be directly used for photosynthesis, while the increase of HCO3- in the medium represents a higher input of CO32- for micropearl formation. This could enhance micropearl formation, explaining the larger size of micropearls and the higher Sr absorption by T. chui. (C) An uncontrolled addition of CO2 in the T. chui cultures (in our study, the addition of 10 mL L-1 h-1 CO2 for more than three days) can over-acidify the culture medium. This acidification could inactivate ion transport proteins located in the cell membrane, inhibiting micropearl formation.  7.5.4. Tetraselmis: a potential bioremediation agent T. chui has proven to be a robust species, able to reach high cell densities in environments with different pH and salinities (18‰ (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022), 20‰ in cultures of experiments A, and 30‰ in  cultures of experiments B) which is an essential requirement for an organism to be used as a bioremediation agent. As previously mentioned, some countries have established a maximum Sr concentration recommended in drinking water, ranging between 4 to 18 mg L-1 (ATSDR, 2004; ANSES, 2012; Health Canada, 2018). Here, T. chui cultures initially containing 0.04, 0.4, and 0.8 mM Sr (3.51, 35.10, and 70.10, mg L-1 Sr, respectively) reached Sr concentrations within the recommended limit after one week of growth (Fig. 2A-C and 3A).   
Chapter VII 
 176 A recent study demonstrated the capacity of T. chui to absorb radioactive 90Sr and showed that a cell concentration higher than 1.5x106 cell mL-1 would be enough to remove almost all added 90Sr from the culture medium (Chapter VI). Results presented here are promising since bubble column PBRs allowed to obtain T. chui cell concentrations that are twice the concentration needed for the almost complete removal of 90Sr. In addition, this culture system can be reproduced on a larger scale and cultures can be transferred into other PBR types such as tubular PBRs (Fernandez et al., 2014; Acién et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2017; Pereira et al., 2018). Moreover, since the suitability of T. suecica and Tetraselmis sp. for CO2 mitigation has been demonstrated (Moheimani, 2016; Kassim and Meng, 2017; Pereira et al., 2018), we can expect that this will also be the case for T. chui due to its high similarity to these species. A cultivation system coupled to a CO2 source would not only contribute to CO2 mitigation but would also favor Sr removal from water if the pH of the culture is controlled. Our results also suggest the use of other species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae for bioremediation purposes regarding 90Sr pollution as it has been shown that Sr uptake is related to micropearl formation (Segovia-Campos et al., 2022). Indeed, high concentrations of Sr have already been reported in T. suecica biomass (Ulloa et al., 2012). Since micropearl-forming species live in very diverse environments, including hypersaline water, seawater, brackish water, and freshwater, the field of application of this bioremediation technology could be extremely broad (Martignier et al., 2018; Segovia-Campos et al., 2021). 7.6. Conclusions The present study shows high Sr removal efficiencies in T. chui cultures grown in vertical bubble column PBRs with a culture medium mainly composed of either natural seawater or natural sea salts. The Sr removal from the growth medium increases with the cell density of the culture, demonstrating the importance of optimizing culture growth for bioremediation applications.  CO2 enhancement in T. chui cultures prevents excessive pH rise of the cultures, increases cell growth, and can favor the Sr uptake by the cells. However, a pH under 7.5 might alter Chapter VII 
 177 the micropearl formation process, decreasing the Sr uptake capacity of the cells. It is, therefore, necessary to control the pH of the cultures with CO2 supply in order to avoid excessive acidification of the cultures.  This work shows that T. chui is a robust candidate for the development of bioremediation techniques to treat 90Sr contamination as well as high natural Sr levels in drinking water. Since the ability to sequester Sr is related to the micropearl formation capacity of the species, it is likely that other species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae, including freshwater species, could be used for the same purpose. If proven, bioremediation techniques involving the use of Chlorodedrophyceae could be applied in very diverse environments.  7.7.

 184 8.1. Function and formation process of micropearls The relatively recent discovery of micropearls in the class of green microalgae Chlorodendrophyceae raised many questions about their physiological function and the mechanisms underlying their formation. Although not all the unknowns around this biomineralization process have been solved, this thesis offers new insights, material, and tools that will/might be key to further research on the topic. 8.1.1. Role of calcium, strontium, and micropearls For the first time, the formation of micropearls has been followed under controlled conditions in Tetraselmis chui laboratory cultures. The main outputs of these studies are: 1- The high Ca uptake by T. chui cells is clearly related to micropearls formation and cell growth. This follows from low Ca concentrations in T. chui cultures inhibiting both micropearl formation and cell growth, whereas the growth of T. marina (non-micropearl-forming species) cultures is not affected at these Ca concentrations. Thus, micropearl formation and cell growth are interdependent processes in T. chui (and, most likely, in other micropearl-forming species). 2- A high Sr uptake by T. chui cells is related, again, to micropearl formation. The Sr/Ca ratio measured in T. chui micropearls is significantly higher than in the culture medium, indicating the ability of this organism to highly concentrate this element. Why Sr is present in such high concentrations in micropearls remains unknown. However, we have made some observations on the different roles of Ca and Sr: (i) the addition of Sr in T. chui cultures triggers micropearl formation and cell growth when Ca concentration in the culture medium is not high enough for micropearl formation (< 0.5 mM Ca); (ii) Sr addition cannot trigger micropearl formation and cell growth when Ca is totally absent; (iii) if Ca is added to the culture at concentrations allowing micropearl formation, the absence of Sr in the culture neither prevents micropearl formation nor affects cell growth. Hence, Sr is not essential for micropearl formation and cell growth but can partially replace Ca function in T. chui cells.  Chapter VIII  
 185 3- Micropearl location within the cells is actively controlled. Instead of observing a random micropearl distribution during cell division, micropearls are equally distributed among the daughter cells. Both the observed interdependence between micropearls and cell growth and the strong cellular control on micropearl distribution suggests that micropearls play an essential role in T.  chui and other micropearl-forming species. 8.1.2. Micropearl formation process Main hints: 1- Fast time of formation. By following the Ca and Sr concentrations in the growth medium of T. chui cultures over time, a strong uptake of both elements is detected during the exponential growth stage of the cultures, indicating that micropearl formation occurs rapidly after cell division. Both Ca and Sr are transported from the culture medium to the micropearls in less than one hour, showing that micropearl formation in T. chui is a process faster than previously thought.  2- Ca and Sr simultaneously present. Analysis of the elemental distribution of Ca and Sr in T. chui cytoplasm shows that both elements are always detected together, even in regions of the cell where micropearls are not observed. Since a lower Ca uptake rate by T. chui cells is observed when Sr is added to the culture, it is very likely that Ca and Sr are incorporated into the micropearls sharing the same cellular pathways.  3- Possible role of Mg. A close relationship between Mg and the micropearl formation process was shown by chemical bioimaging of T. chui cytoplasm. The exact function of Mg is unknown but it might play an important role in the stabilization of micropearls as it has been shown when added as an inorganic additive for ACC stabilization (Loste et al., 2003).  4- Organic layer covering micropearls. Observation of T. chui ultrastructure reveals a monolayered structure surrounding each micropearl individually. The nature of this structure remains unknown, but its presence might indicate that micropearl Chapter VIII  
 186 formation occurs in cellular compartments, isolating them from the cytosol and, most likely, favoring their stabilization.  5- Through an RNA differential expression study, genes that are potentially related to micropearl formation have been identified. Most of these genes encode for Ca and HCO3- transport proteins such as Ca2+-ATPases, Ca2+/H+ antiporters, voltage-gated Ca channels, and Na+/HCO3- cotransporters, as well as for carbonic anhydrases. The location of these transport proteins is not yet known.  8.2. Tetraselmis chui as a potential bioremediation agent Testing the suitability of Tetraselmis chui as a potential bioremediation agent required studying two aspects: (i) whether the alga removes 90Sr from the medium (as it does with the stable isotope); (ii) the optimization of T. chui growth and 90Sr removal in large scale culture systems. Although the use of Chlorodendrophyceae for the removal of radioactive 90Sr in the environment had been suggested several times, its capacity to absorb this radionuclide and the effect of the ionizing radiation on cell viability had never been tested. Here, T. chui cultured in seawater with concentrations of 90Sr similar to those measured in the environment after a nuclear accident shows a high 90Sr absorption by this organism. The 90Sr removal from the growth medium was correlated to the cell density of the cultures, with a cell concentration of 1.5x106 cells mL-1 being enough to remove all the 90Sr added in the cultures. The growth of T. chui cultures was optimized in bubble column photobioreactors using seawater amended with natural Sr, allowing to reach cell densities higher than 1.5x106 cells mL-1 and showing an almost complete removal of Sr in less than one week of growth. The addition of CO2 to the culture accelerates both T. chui growth and the Sr absorption by the cells. Since this type of photobioreactors can be reproduced on a very large scale, the suitability of this culture system for the implementation of new bioremediation techniques for 90Sr decontamination is clear. Moreover, because the Sr absorption in species within the class Chlorodendrophyaceae is related to their capacity to form Chapter VIII  
 187 micropearls, it is very likely that other species could be used for the same purpose, including those living in freshwater environments. Chlorodendrophyceae microalgae have several advantages compared to other organisms proposed in the past for bioremediation purposes, such as their potential application in diverse aquatic environments, their robustness and fast growth, and the low energy consumption associated with their production. 8.3. New methods and tools for the study of micropearls Due to the novelty underlying this research and the significant instability of micropearls, much of this work has consisted of developing new methods allowing the study of this biomineralization phenomenon and its potential application.  Sample preparation for TEM has been very problematic when it comes to preserving ACC, making it difficult to study the cellular structures associated with micropearls. However, this study provides new techniques allowing to preserve micropearls and the cellular structures enveloping these inclusions for TEM observation. These new preparation techniques have also allowed to study for the first time the elemental composition of T. chui cytoplasm using NanoSIMS and to obtain some hints about the Ca and Sr transport within the cell before reaching the micropearls. Since the nature of the organic matter present in the micropearls is still unknown, this study also develops a simple protocol for micropearl extraction and purification that could be helpful in future research. This could be especially useful to identify the proteins present in these inclusions, if any.  Finally, this study provides for the first time the complete genome sequence of T. chui with its respective transcriptome, allowing the identification of some of the genes that are potentially related to the formation of micropearls. This achievement is especially important as it opens the door to further research, essential for the complete understanding of this biomineralization process. Chapter VIII  
 188 8.4. Outlook   8.4.1. Study of the formation process of micropearls The study of this biomineralization process requires further research as there are still many unknown aspects to be deciphered. Some ideas for further investigation are proposed: Effort in genome annotation Currently, less than 26% percent of the genes are annotated and therefore several genes related to this biomineralization process have probably been overlooked. Hence, it is important to continue working on T. chui genome annotation to obtain as much information as possible. Comparative genome analysis  Comparison of T. chui genome with that of other species belonging to the class Chlorodendrophyceae (especially with that of non-micropearl-forming species, such as T. marina) will help to identify genes linked to the micropearl formation process. Further study on gene expression through real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) Since the genome and transcriptome have been sequenced, it is now possible to target a given gene and study its expression under controlled conditions using qRT-PCR. This is a simple technique that could allow a better understanding on gene function. Study of the subcellular location of proteins potentially involved in the formation of micropearls using GFP-tagging Determining the subcellular location of the proteins involved in the biomineralization process would also be an essential step to understand their function. This could be achieved by transforming T. chui with GFP-tagged genes coding for the proteins of interest.   Chapter VIII  
 189 Study of the organic macromolecules associated with micropearls The study of the organic macromolecules (especially, of the proteins) contained in micropearls might be possible using the purification technique presented in this thesis. This could help to better understand the formation and stabilization mechanisms underlying this biomineralization process. 8.4.2. Implementation of a new bioremediation system The present study shows the potential of T. chui to be used for the development of new bioremediation techniques for 90Sr decontamination. However, there are still several aspects that need to be studied, as follows: Study of the 90Sr uptake by other species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae Since the high Sr uptake observed in T. chui has been shown to be related to its capacity to form micropearls, it is very likely that other robust species within the class Chlorodendrophyceae, such as T. suecica or T. tetrathele, are also good candidates for 90Sr decontamination purposes. The study of the 90Sr removal capacity of other species would allow to select the best candidate for the implementation of this new technique. Study of the behavior of Chlorodendrophyceae in presence of other radionuclides such as 137Cs and 226Ra In the event of a nuclear disaster, 90Sr is not the only radionuclide released into the environment. Other elements such as 137Cs and 226Ra are also often present. It would be important to study the behavior of T. chui and other species in the presence of these radioisotopes.  Scaling-up of the cultures amended with Sr To further confirm the suitability of these species for the implementation of a new bioremediation system regarding 90Sr contamination, it would be necessary to scale-up the cultures amended with Sr. This could be performed in existing photobioreactors (Fig. 1). Study of the biomass harvesting, treatment, and storage process Chapter VIII  
 190 The biomass harvesting process and its subsequent treatment are critical aspects in the development of the new bioremediation system. A detailed study of the procedure to be followed would be strictly necessary.

Early  light-microscopists  hadspotted  rows  of  refractive  granules  in  some  species,  although  without  identifying  their  mineral  nature.Scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  observations  showed  that  the  distribution  of  the  micropearls  inthe  cell  forms  a  pattern,  which  appears  to  be  characteristic  for  a  given  species.  The  present  studyshows  that  this  pattern  correlates  with  the  shape  of  the  chloroplast,  which  differs  between  Tetraselmisspecies,  because  micropearls  align  themselves  along  the  incisions  between  chloroplast  lobes.  Thiswas  observed  both  by  SEM  and  in  live  cells  by  light  microscopy  (LM)  using  Nomarski  differential  inter-ference  contrast.  Additionally,  molecular  phylogenetic  analyses,  of  rbcL  and  ITS2  gene  sequencesfrom  diverse  strains  of  Chlorodendrophyceae,  corroborated  the  morphological  observations  by  iden-tifying  two  groups  among  nominal  Tetraselmis  spp.  that  differ  in  chloroplast  morphology,  micropearlarrangement,  and  ITS2  RNA  secondary  structure.©  2020  The  Authors.

Filella  et  al.IntroductionBiomineralization  refers  to  the  process  by  whichorganisms  form  minerals  (Weiner  and  Dove  2003).Some  organisms  can  control  the  mineralizationprocess  (nucleation,  growth,  morphology  and  ﬁnallocation  of  the  mineral),  which  generally  takesplace  in  an  isolated  environment  (e.g.  vacuole,vesicle)  corresponding  to  a  site  of  controlled  chem-istry  (Mann  2001).  The  biominerals  of  intracellularorigin  mostly  become  extracellular  (e.g.  the  cal-cium  carbonate  scales  termed  coccoliths,  producedby  haptophytes,  which  undergo  rapid  exocytosis;Paasche  2002;  Taylor  and  Brownlee  2016;  Weinerand  Dove  2003).  In  a  less  frequently  used  strategy,some  biominerals  remain  in  the  cell,  either  procur-ing  an  intracellular  structure  such  as  the  siliceousfrustule  of  diatoms,  or  becoming  an  inorganicintracellular  inclusion  (Konhauser  2007),  like  themagnetosomes  of  magnetotactic  bacteria  (Faivreand  Schüler  2008).Although  calcium  carbonate  minerals  are  themost  abundant  biogenic  minerals  (Weiner  andDove  2003),  intracellular  inclusions  of  calcium  car-bonate  in  unicellular  organisms  were  generallythought  to  be  rare.  Indeed,  intracellular  calciumcarbonate  inclusions  had  been  described  only  inthe  giant  sulfur  bacterium  Achromatium  oxaliferum(Gray  2006;  Head  et  al.  2000)  and  in  several  cil-iates  (Fauré-Fremiet  and  Gauchery  1957;  Lemloh2015).  Nevertheless,  several  species  of  cyanobac-teria  were  recently  also  discovered  to  produceintracellular  inclusions  of  amorphous  calcium  car-bonate  (ACC)  (Benzerara  et  al.  2014;  Blondeauet  al.  2018a;  Cam  et  al.  2017;  Couradeau  et  al.2012;  Ragon  et  al.  2014),  and  even  more  recentlya  similar  unsuspected  biomineralization  capacitywas  discovered  in  at  least  ten  species  of  the  genusT etraselmis  (Chlorodendrophyceae,  Chlorophyta;Martignier  et  al.  2018).  It  seems  that  the  biomineralsproduced  by  certain  species  of  both  cyanobacteriaand  unicellular  algae  are  often  enriched  in  alka-line  earth-elements  (e.g.  Sr,  Ba;  Blondeau  et  al.2018b;  Cam  et  al.  2016;  Martignier  et  al.  2017).  Theinclusions  formed  by  eukaryotes  are  called  micro-pearls  (Martignier  et  al.  2017,  2018)  and  typicallydisplay  internal  concentric  zonation.  Despite  thor-ough  descriptions  of  some  T etraselmis  species,  thedetection  of  the  micropearls  by  electron  microscopyhad  previously  been  prevented  because  micro-pearls  can  be  easily  dissolved  by  most  of  the  classicpreparations  of  biological  samples.This  was  alsoproven  to  be  true  for  the  calcium  carbonate  inclu-sions  produced  by  other  organisms  (cyanobacteria:Li  et  al.  2016;  Achromatium:  Schorn  et  al.  2020.Altogether,  these  observations  strongly  suggestthat  other  well-studied  organisms  might  possesssimilar,  yet  unsuspected,  biomineralization  capac-ities.  In  the  present  work,  micropearls  producedby  T etraselmis  species  were  imaged  by  Scan-ning  Electron  Microscopy  (SEM),  following  anunconventional  sample  preparation  (samples  sim-ply  dried  at  room  temperature)  previously  used  toobserve  diatom  frustules  from  Lake  Geneva  waters(Switzerland)  (Martignier  et  al.  2017).Early  light-microscopists  had  apparently  alreadyobserved  the  micropearls,  which  they  describedas  refractive  granules,  without  identifying  their  min-eral  nature.  Carter  (1938),  Hollande  et  al.  (1954)and  Butcher  (1959)  described  longitudinal  rows  ofthese  granules  by  light  microscopy  in  T etraselmisspp.  The  granule  rows  were  observed  in  theinterstice  between  the  lobes  of  the  chloroplastin  T etraselmis  tetrathele  by  Carter  (1938),  whoalso  noted  that  they  did  not  stain  with  iodine.Later,  Norris  et  al.  (1980)  disregarded  the  tax-onomic  value  of  the  granule  rows  in  the  genusT etraselmis.  In  1993,  Hoef-Emden  (M.Sc.  thesis,Univ.  of  Cologne,  unpublished),  studying  60  strainsof  T etraselmis  spp.  by  light  microscopy,  showed  thataccumulation  of  these  granules  frequently  occursat  the  apical/ﬂagella  poles  of  cells  (more  rarelyat  the  posterior  poles),  but  is  highly  variable  andpartly  related  to  the  age  of  the  culture.  Martignieret  al.  (2018)  observed  that  the  micropearls  tend  toform  a  pattern  in  the  cell,  which  is  characteristicof  a  given  species.  These  authors  also  stated  thattwo  T etraselmis  species  (T.  marina  and  T.  ascus)lack  micropearls,  suggesting  considerable  diversityof  micropearl  production  and  distribution  amongChlorodendrophyceae.It is  generally  thought  that  the  class  Chloro-dendrophyceae  is  composed  of  only  two  genera:T etraselmis  F.  Stein,  1878  and  Scherffelia  (Perty)Pascher,  1912,  although  a  third  genus  (Prasin-ocladus  Kuckuck,  1894)  is  sometimes  also  included(Guiry  and  Guiry  2020).  The  class  Chloro-dendrophyceae  is  in  need  of  revision  and  nocomprehensive  phylogenetic  analyses  of  the  classhas  yet  been  published  (Marin  and  Melkonian,unpubl.  observ.).Many  plastid,  mitochondrial  or  nuclear  molec-ular  markers  have  been  tested  for  phylogeneticstudies  of  algae.  The  plastid-encoded  rbcL  genehas  been  widely  used  as  a  molecular  marker  forphylogenetic  analysis  of  algae  and  embryophytesat  the  genus  and  species  level  (Hollingsworthet  al.  2011;  Palmer  et  al.  1988;  Soltis  et  al.2000)  but  it  has  been  rarely  used  in  the  Chloro-Biomineralization  Capacities  of  Chlorodendrophyceae  3dendrophyceae  (Chantzistrountsiou  et  al.  2016).Another  marker  often  used  for  phylogenetic  anal-ysis  is  the  nuclear-encoded  internal  transcribedspacer  region  (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2  =  ITS)  of  the  rRNAoperon,  which  is  known  to  be  more  variable  insequence  than  the  SSU  rRNA  gene.  It  has  beenused  for  species-level  discrimination  and  barcod-ing  of  algae  (review  by  Leliaert  et  al.  2014  but  seecritical  appraisal  by  Caisová  et  al.  2011,  2013).The  ITS  region  was  previously  applied  to  phy-logenetic  analyses  of  some  T etraselmis  speciesisolated  from  Chile  (González  et  al.  2015)  andsome  preliminary  molecular  phylogenetic  analysesof  Chlorodendrophyceae  using  SSU  rRNA  genecomparisons  have  been  published  (Arora  et  al.2013).The  present  study  investigates  thirteen  speciesbelonging  to  the  class  Chlorodendrophyceae  (12T etraselmis  and  one  Scherffelia  species),  with  theobjective  of  understanding  whether  (i)  their  capac-ity  to  form  micropearls  is  related  to  their  phylogenyand  (ii)  the  arrangement  of  micropearls  in  thecell  can  be  correlated  with  the  shape  of  theirchloroplasts  and,  thus,  be  regarded  as  character-istic  for  a  given  species  or  set  of  species.  DNAsequences  (both  ITS2  and  rbcL  sequences)  wereestablished  for  the  strains  and  used  together  withknown  sequences  from  databases  to  reconstructphylogenic  relationships  among  T etraselmis  spp.Micropearl  arrangements  for  each  strain  were  ana-lyzed  by  both  SEM  and  LM,  while  chloroplastshapes  were  imaged  by  epiﬂuorescence  usingchlorophyll  autoﬂuorescence.ResultsImaging  of  the  Micropearls  in  Live  cells  byLight  MicroscopyMicropearls  were  successfully  imaged  in  live  cellsby  light  microscopy  (Figs  1,  2  )  using  Nomarski  Dif-ferential  Interference  Contrast  (DIC).  These  imagesconﬁrm  that  the  micropearls  correspond  to  therefractive  granules  described  by  Carter  (1938)  andButcher  (1959).  Figures  1  and  2  also  show  thatmicropearls  are  located  along  incisions  of  thechloroplast,  as  stated  by  Carter  (1938)  and  thatthey  are  generally  located  preferentially  near  theapical/ﬂagella  pole  of  the  cells  (e.g.  T.  chui  andT.  cordiformis  in  Fig.  1),  sometimes  forming  apicalaggregates  of  micropearls.SEM  Images  and  EDXS  Analyses  ofMicropearl  Arrangement  in  Cells  ofT etraselmis  sppIn  previous  studies,  Martignier  et  al.  (2018)  showedthat  the  distribution  of  micropearls  in  T etraselmiscells  is  not  random  and  forms  a  pattern,  whichis  characteristic  for  a  given  species  (Figs  1,  2).Some  of  these  characteristic  patterns  are  similarand  can  be  combined  into  groups,  which  are  illus-trated  in  Figure  3  .  Although  the  micropearls  canbe  observed  by  light  microscopy,  SEM  imaging  ofdried  cells  provides  a  complementary  technique  tovisualize  these  patterns:  the  dried  organic  matteris  ﬂattened  by  desiccation,  creating  an  approxi-mate  2D  projection  of  the  location  of  micropearlswithin  the  cell.  Figures  1  and  2  illustrate  this  fea-ture  by  systematically  comparing  light  microscopyand  SEM  images  for  seven  different  T etraselmisspecies.  EDXS  analyses  (Supplementary  MaterialFigs  S1,  S2)  conﬁrm  the  presence  of  Ca  in  thecomposition  of  the  micropearls  in  each  T etraselmisspecies  considered  in  the  present  study,  indicatingthe  carbonate  nature  of  these  inclusions,  studied  byMartignier  et  al.  (2017)  and  excluding  phosphate  orsulfur  compositions  as  P  and  S  are  absent.Micropearls  in  Scherffelia,  the  SecondGenus  of  ChlorodendrophyceaeSEM  observation  of  Scherffelia  dubia  revealed  thatthis  species,  the  second  genus  in  the  Chloroden-drophyceae,  also  produces  micropearls  (Fig.  4).We  have  noted  that  the  micropearls  of  thisfreshwater  species  are  spherical,  similar  to  themicropearls  of  T etraselmis  cordiformis,  the  onlyother  known  freshwater  species  in  the  Chloro-dendrophyceae.  In  comparison,  the  micropearls  ofthe  marine  T etraselmis  spp.  are  elongated  (“ricegrain”  shapes),  particularly  in  T.  contracta  and  T.desikacharyi  (Martignier  et  al.  2018).Shape  of  Chloroplasts  Visualized  byEpiﬂuorescenceAlthough  the  incisions  of  the  chloroplast  can  beobserved  by  DIC  light  microscopy  (Figs  1,  2,  4),chlorophyll  autoﬂuorescence  of  the  chloroplastsby  epiﬂuorescence  often  provides  a  more  detailedview  of  the  shapes  of  the  chloroplasts  in  the  dif-ferent  T etraselmis  species  (Fig.  5).  For  example,T.  chui,  T.  striata  and  T.  suecica  show  chloroplastswith  four  anterior  lobes,  whereas  T.  contracta  and  T.desikacharyi  display  more  than  four  anterior  chloro-4  A.

The  outgroup  taxon  Scherf-felia  dubia  also  has  a  four-lobed  chloroplast,suggesting  that  this  is  the  plesiomorphic  conditionin  the  Chlorodendrophyceae.

Although  the  secondarystructure  of  ITS2  is  conserved  within  the  Chlorodendrophyceae  and  follows  the  general  4-Helix  pattern,  thestructure  of  Helix  3  shows  an  interesting  feature:  in  several  species  (as  e.g.  T.  desikacharyi)  this  helix  isbranched,  and  contains  an  additional,  lateral  helix.

Sequences  with  accession  numbers  starting  with  MK482were  newly  generated  during  the  present  study.and  discovered  a  major  difference  between  them,in  that  the  group  with  more  than  four  anteriorchloroplast  lobes  (and  including  T.  convolutae)displayed  a  branched  Helix  3  (a  lateral  branch),whereas  in  the  group  with  four  anterior  chloroplastlobes  Helix  3  was  unbranched.The  phylogeny  inferred  from  the  partial  rbcL  gene(Fig.  8),  in  principle,  gave  the  same  result.  However,the  group  of  strains  with  more  than  four  anteriorchloroplast  lobes  formed  a  grade,  whereas  thegroup  with  four  anterior-chloroplast  lobes  was  mod-erately  supported  (67/1.0)  as  a  clade  (Fig.  8).  Eachgroup  splits  into  several,  often  maximally  supportedsubclades  with  similar  strain  composition  as  in  the5.8S/ITS2  phylogeny  (because  of  the  databasesequences,  sampling  of  strains  was  not  congruentbetween  the  two  analyses).12  A.  Martignier,  S.  De  Respinis,  M.  Filella  et  al.DiscussionA  Biomineralization  Capacity  Present  inall  ChlorodendrophyceaeAccording  to  Melkonian  and  Preisig  (1986),  thereare  only  two  genera  in  the  Chlorodendrophyceae:Scherffelia  and  Tetraselmis.  The  present  resultsshow  that  micropearls  occur  in  both  of  them,  sug-gesting  that  the  last  common  ancestor  of  the  twogenera  also  possessed  the  capacity  to  producemicropearls.The functional  role  of  the  micropearls  might  belinked  to  motility,  ﬂagellar  shedding  and  regen-eration  as  well  as  scale  formation  and  stability(Melkonian  1982;  Reize  and  Melkonian  1987;Salisbury  et  al.  1984).  Salisbury  et  al.  (1984),  intheir  study  on  T.  striata,  concluded  that  “striatedﬂagellar  roots  are  simple  ion-sensitive  contractileorganelles  composed  predominantly  of  20,000  Mrcalcium-binding  phosphoprotein  and  (.  .  .)  this  pro-tein  is  largely  responsible  for  the  motile  behaviorof  these  organelles”.  Their  article  described  for  theﬁrst  time  in  striated  ﬂagellar  roots/rhizoplasts  anEF-hand  calcium-binding  protein  involved  in  motilityof  eukaryotic  ﬂagellate  organisms  and  associatedwith  basal  bodies/centrioles,  later  named  centrin.Centrins  are  now  known  to  be  a  family  of  calcium-binding  phosphoproteins  that  are  present  in  manyorganisms  including  humans.  They  are  requirede.g.  for  the  duplication  of  centrioles  (Salisbury  et  al.2002)  and  play  a  role  in  nucleotide  excision  repair(Nishi  et  al.  2005).  Given  the  location  of  the  micro-pearl  aggregate  in  most  of  the  observed  species,which  is  close  to  the  ﬂagellar  apparatus,  we  suggestthat  the  micropearls  could  play  a  role  as  calciumstorage  in  the  Chlorodendrophyceae,  in  relation  tothe  different  roles  calcium  plays  in  their  metabolismand  during  their  life  history.The  Distribution  of  the  Micropearls  in  theCell  is  Linked  to  the  ChloroplastMorphologyMost  Tetraselmis  species  present  an  apical  aggre-gate  of  micropearls,  but  some  of  the  micropearlscan  also  form  additional  longitudinal  alignmentsin  the  cell  (Figs  1,  2).  These  “meridians”  drawthe  main  lines  of  the  species-characteristic  pat-tern  described  by  Martignier  et  al.  (2018).  Thelight  microscopy  images  of  micropearls  in  live  cells,shown  in  this  study  by  Nomarski  DIC  at  high  reso-lution  (Figs  1,  2),  conﬁrm  that  these  meridians  arethe  result  of  micropearls  aligned  along  the  incisionsbetween the  chloroplast  lobes.  Carter  (1938)  wasapparently  the  ﬁrst  to  observe  the  micropearls  inthe  light  microscope.  She  had  already  suggestedthat  the  arrangement  of  these  “refractive  granules”,as  she  called  them,  depended  on  the  shape  of  thechloroplast.  The  epiﬂuorescence  images  depictedin  Figure  5  provide  a  clear  documentation  of  thechloroplast  morphology  in  some  of  the  studiedspecies.The comparison  between  Figures  1–5  supportsthe  hypothesis  that  micropearl  arrangement  cor-relates  with  the  shape  of  the  chloroplast.  Morespeciﬁcally,  we  can  state  that  the  species  pre-senting  four-lobed  chloroplasts  (T.  striata,  T.  chui,T.  levis,  T.  suecica  and  T.  tetrathele)  all  have  amicropearl  arrangement  presenting  a  trimeroussymmetry  (i.e.  trident  shape  or  three  equidis-tant  lines,  see  Fig.  3A),  representing  micropearlsaligned  along  incisions  between  the  chloroplastlobes.  The  fourth  line  of  micropearls  is  “hidden”,underneath  the  ﬂattened  cell.  The  only  exceptionis  T.  striata:  we  suggest  that  this  is  due  to  the  cellmorphology,  which  allows  only  one  (or  maximallytwo)  of  the  very  thin  micropearl  alignments  to  bevisible  at  the  same  time  in  SEM  images  (Fig.  3A).The  chloroplast  of  both  T.  desikacharyi  (Fig.  5E,F)  and  T.  contracta  (Fig.  5G)  presents  more  thaneight  lobes,  which  corresponds  to  the  numerousmeridians  of  micropearls  forming  the  characteristicpatterns  of  these  species  (Fig.  3B).  The  net-like  chloroplast  of  T.  cordiformis  (not  shown;  seealso  Melkonian  1979)  causes  the  apical  aggregateof  this  species  to  be  accompanied  by  scatteredmicropearls,  sometimes  added  to  small  micropearlalignments  (Figures  1H  and  3  C).  Finally,  the  well-delimited  micropearl  aggregate  of  T.  convolutae(Figs  1E,  F  and  3  D)  generally  seems  to  be  locatedat  the  posterior  end  of  the  cell,  in  an  invaginationof  the  cup-shaped  chloroplast  (Fig.  5D),  while  theanterior  end  is  occupied  by  large  polyphosphatevacuoles.Accordingly,  the  trident  pattern  formed  by  themicropearls  inside  the  cell  of  Scherffelia  dubia(Fig.  4)  indicates  the  presence  of  a  four-lobedchloroplast  (conﬁrmed  by  transmission  electronmicroscopy;  Melkonian  and  Preisig  1986).  It  mustbe  noted  that  the  chloroplast  shape  of  S.  dubiaresults  in  the  aggregation  of  micropearls  at  the  pos-terior  part  of  the  cell  rather  than  in  the  apical  part,unlike  most  Tetraselmis  species  (Fig.  4D).Clade-speciﬁc  Micropearl  PatternsThe  phylogenetic  trees  produced  by  the  analysisof  the  5.8S/ITS2  (Fig.  6)  and  the  rbcL  sequencesBiomineralization  Capacities  of  Chlorodendrophyceae  13(Fig.  8)  gave  basically  the  same  result,  althoughsupport  values  for  the  two  major  groups  of  strainsin  the  Chlorodendrophyceae  differed  somewhatand  grades  instead  of  clades  were  also  encoun-tered  as  expected  from  the  small  datasets  used.The  group  of  strains  with  four-lobed  chloroplastsformed  a  grade  in  the  5.8S/ITS2  tree  and  corre-sponds  in  morphology  to  species  of  the  previouslydescribed  genus  Platymonas  G.  S.  West  1916  (typespecies  P.  tetrathele).  The  group  of  strains  withchloroplasts  with  >8  lobes  (and  including  T.  con-volutae)  refers  to  previously  described  species  ofTetraselmis  F.  Stein,  1878  (type  species  T.  cordi-formis).  Platymonas  was  regarded  as  a  juniorsynonym  to  Tetraselmis  by  Norris  et  al.  (1980),who  transferred  all  Platymonas  spp.  to  genusTetraselmis,  apparently  based  on  plesiomorphiccharacters  (theca,  scales,  rhizoplast),  discovered,when  the  type  species  T.  cordiformis  was  ﬁrstinvestigated  by  electron  microscopy  (Melkonian1979).  Our  data,  including  identiﬁcation  of  a  non-homoplasious  synapomorphy,  a  branched  Helix  3  inthe  ITS2  molecule,  in  the  group  of  strains  display-ing  chloroplasts  with  more  than  8  lobes,  suggestthat  the  taxonomic  rearrangements  made  by  Norriset  al.  (1980)  should  be  re-evaluated.In  general,  our  results  show  that  the  non-random  patterns  of  micropearl  distribution  in  theChlorodendrophyceae  (Figs  1–4)  reﬂect  chloro-plast  morphology  (Fig.  5).  Thus,  we  suggest  that  thepatterns  of  micropearl  arrangement,  when  present,may  be  characteristic  enough  to  constitute  a  validcriterion  to  distinguish  some  of  the  different  phy-logenetic  groups  within  the  Chlorodendrophyceae.Even  when  considering  variations  in  the  patternsof  micropearl  arrangement  that  relate  to  differentphysiological  states  of  cells  (Supplementary  Mate-rial  Fig.  S3),  if  micropearl  alignments  are  present,the  distribution  pattern  of  micropearls  in  a  givenclade  is  generally  distinct  from  the  pattern  of  otherclades.Scherffelia  dubia,  which  was  deﬁned  as  out-group  in  the  phylogenetic  analyses,  displayed  atrimerous  symmetry  in  micropearl  arrangementas  well  as  a  four-lobed  chloroplast  suggest-ing  that  this  arrangement  may  be  ancestral  inthe  Chlorodendrophyceae:  phylogenetic  analysesusing  comparison  of  complete  nuclear-  and  plastid-encoded  rRNA  operon  sequences,  suggest  thatgenus  Scherffelia  is  indeed  the  ﬁrst  divergencein  the  Chlorodendrophyceae  (Marin  and  Melko-nian,  unpubl.  observ.).  This  is  corroborated  bythe  observation  that  species  of  the  early-divergingprasinophyte  genus  Pyramimonas  (e.g.  P.  ori-entalis;  Carter  1938)  also  exhibits  a  trimeroussymmetry of  refractive  granules,  which  may  corre-spond  to  micropearls.Evolution  Linked  to  Habitat  Constraints?Interestingly,  Tetraselmis  species  sharing  the  samepatterns  of  micropearl  arrangement  (Fig.  3A)share  the  same  type  of  habitat  (Table  1).  All  theTetraselmis  strains  presenting  four-lobed  chloro-plasts  (corresponding  to  the  green  clade  in  Fig.  6:T.  tetrathele,  T.  suecica,  T.  subcordiformis,  T.  chui,T.  striata  and  T.  levis)  live  as  free-swimmingphytoplankton  in  the  marine  environment,  alsoin  rock  pools  (Butcher  1959;  Guiry  and  Guiry2020).  The  members  of  the  T.  marina  clade  donot  produce  micropearls  (Martignier  et  al.  2018)and  represent  stalked,  sessile  colonies  (Norriset  al.  1980).  T.  cordiformis  (Fig.  3C)  is  the  onlyknown  freshwater  species  of  the  genus  (Ettl1983;  Melkonian  1979).  Finally,  T.  desikacharyiand  T.  contracta  (Fig.  3B)  were  both  sampledas  benthic  organisms  in  sand  (Marin  et  al.1996,  https://www.uni-due.de/biology/ccac/),  whileT.  convolutae  (Fig.  3D)  lives  as  a  photosymbiontin  a  ﬂatworm  (Muscatine  et  al.  1974).  We  musttherefore  consider  the  possibility  that  the  habitat  ofthese  organisms  has  a  link  with  the  morphology  oftheir  chloroplasts  and  the  distribution  of  the  micro-pearls  inside  the  cells.  The  correlations  betweenthese  characteristics  and  the  phylogenetic  positionof  the  species  studied  poses  the  question  of  a  pos-sible  genetic  basis  for  the  distribution  of  micropearlsand  functional  implications  in  relation  to  habitat  con-straints  met  by  the  different  strains/species.ConclusionsThe  recently  discovered  biomineralization  capac-ities  of  ten  Tetraselmis  species  is  shown  hereto  be  shared  by  at  least  one  species  of  thegenus  Scherffelia  (S.  dubia),  and  thus  potentiallyextend  to  the  whole  class  Chlorodendrophyceae(except  for  T.  marina).  The  numerous  intracellu-lar  inclusions  of  amorphous  calcium  carbonate(ACC),  called  micropearls,  can  be  observed  by  lightmicroscopy  in  live  cells  using  Nomarski  differen-tial  interference  contrast  (DIC)  at  high  resolution,corroborating  previous  SEM  observations.  Thepresent  results  show  that  this  pattern  correlateswith  the  different  shapes  of  the  chloroplasts  indiverse  strains/species,  because  the  micropearlalignments  follow  the  incisions  between  the  chloro-plast  lobes.  Thus,  although  the  arrangement  of14  A.  Martignier,  S.  De  Respinis,  M.  Filella  et  al.Table  1.  Chlorodendrophyceae  species  studied.

Species  presenting  simi-lar  micropearl  arrangements  share  similar  habitats,which  hints  at  a  possible  inﬂuence  of  habitat  con-straints  on  a  genetically  ﬁxed  distribution  of  themicropearls  in  the  cell.MethodsOrigin  of  strains  and  pre-treatment  methods:  Strains  wereobtained  from  different  public  algal  culture  collections  (Table  1).The  composition  of  the  growth  media  used  is  available  on  web-sites  of  the  culture  collections.Preparation  of  samples  for  SEM  observation  was  performedupon  arrival  at  the  Geneva  University  laboratory:  a  few  dropletsof  each  culture  were  ﬁltered  in  their  original  culture  mediumunder  low  vacuum  (<10  kPa)  on  polycarbonate  ﬁlter  mem-branes  (pore  sizes  of  0.2,  1  or  2  /H9262m  diameter).  The  SAGcollection  (University  of  Göttingen)  provided  species  grown  onsolid  media,  which  were  diluted  immediately  before  ﬁltration.Resulting  ﬁlter  membranes  were  dried  at  room  temperature.Scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM)  and  energy-dispersive  X-ray  spectroscopy  (EDXS):  The  dried  ﬁltermembranes  were  pasted  with  double-sided  conductive  car-bon  tape  on  aluminum  stubs.  They  were  coated  with  10  nmof  gold  by  low  vacuum  sputtering.  The  images  and  EDXSanalyses  were  acquired  with  a  JEOL  JSM  7001F  ScanningElectron  Microscope  (Department  of  Earth  Sciences,  Univer-sity  of  Geneva,  Switzerland).  The  EDXS  detector  was  anEX-94300S4L1Q  model  from  JEOL  and  the  EDXS  semi-quantitative  results  were  calculated  using  the  ZAF  correctionmethod.Cell images  were  obtained  by  using  backscattered  electrons.In  this  method,  the  grey  levels  represent  the  mean  atomic  num-ber  of  the  observed  material,  which  produces  a  high  contrastbetween  the  mineral  inclusions  and  the  surrounding  organicmatter.  Setting  for  the  EDXS  measurements  were  of  15  kVaccelerating  voltage  with  a  beam  current  of  ∼5  nA  during  anacquisition  of  30  seconds  per  analyze.Light  microscopy  observation  and  epiﬂuorescence:Micropearls  were  observed  by  light  microscopy  using  NomarskiDifferential  Interference  Contrast  (NIC)  at  high  resolution.  Lightmicroscopy  was  performed  with  a  Leica  DMLB  light  microscopeusing  a  PL-APO  100/1.40  objective,  an  immersed  condenserwith  N.A.  1.4  and  a  Metz  Mecablitz  32  Ct3  ﬂash  system.The  chloroplasts  of  some  cells  were  observed  by  epi-ﬂuorescence  using  a  Leica  DMLB  light  microscope  withepiﬂuorescence  attachment,  objective  100×  oil  immersion(N.A.  1.40).  The  blue  excitation  light  (wavelength  455  nm)  wasprovided  by  a  Cree  Royal  blue  LED.  The  ﬁlter  was  a  Long  PassBarrier
 Filter  515  nm  and  the  camera  was  a  Canon  5D  mark2DLSR.DNA sequencing,  alignments  and  molecular  phylogeny:DNA  was  extracted  by  phenol-chloroform  (Ausubel  et  al.  1993)after  a  pre-treatment  with  lysozyme  (10  mg/mL).  The  InternalTranscribed  Spacer  region  (ITS,  including  ITS1,  5.8S  rDNA  andITS2)  was  ampliﬁed  using  the  universal  ITS5  and  ITS4  primersfor  eukaryotes  (White  et  al.  1990).  The  rbcL  partial  gene  wasampliﬁed  using  the  primers  rbcL-1A1B-Fw  and  rbcL-1A1B-Revfor  phytoplankton  (Paul  et  al.  2000).  Newly  determined  5.8SrDNA  +  ITS2  sequence  data  were  supplemented  with  resultsfrom  BLAST  searches  (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi),to  cover  as  much  sequence  diversity  of  the  Chloroden-drophyceae  as  possible.  Because  ITS2  primary  sequencesas  well  as  sequence  lengths  were  extremely  divergent  inTetraselmis,  it  was  necessary  to  resolve  the  RNA  secondarystructure  for  all  ITS2  sequences  (see  below),  and  to  usethe  pattern  of  double-stranded  helices  and  non-paired  RNAregions  to  obtain  an  optimal  alignment  based  on  homol-ogy.  For  tree  reconstructions,  the  alignment  provided  twodata  partitions:  169  positions  of  the  5.8S  rRNA  gene,  and168  homologous  ITS2  positions  for  50  strains  of  Chloroden-drophyceae.  Phylogenetic  analyses  used  two  methods:  RAxMLvs  8.2.12  (GTR  +  GAMMA,  1,000  bootstrap  replicates)  andMrBayes  vs  3.2.7a  (GTR  +  INVGAMMA,  1.000.000  genera-tions).  Analyses  were  performed  on  the  CIPRES  ScienceGateway  (http://www.phylo.org/sub  sections/portal/).For  rbcL  analyses,  partial  sequences  (372  nt  length)  werecombined  with  up  to  full-length  sequences  (1428  nt),  resulting  inan  alignment  of  30  strains  of  Chlorodendrophyceae.  PreliminaryRAxML  analyses,  which  used  372  (ungapped),  1010,  or  1428characters,  showed  very  similar  results  (not  shown),  and  wedecided  to  analyze  a  gapped  dataset  with  1010  characters  forﬁnal  tree  reconstructions,  again  using  RAxML  and  MrBayes  asabove  for  the  5.8S  rDNA/ITS2  analyses.The  alignments  of  sequences  for  the  Internal  Spacer  Regionand  the  rbcL  gene  are  provided  in  Supplementary  Material  S3and  S4.Secondary  structure  prediction  of  ITS2:  The  initialreconstruction  of  ITS2  secondary  structures  used  Mfold(http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/),  with  entire  ITS2  sequencesand/or  individual  helices  as  input,  often  resulting  in  several  alter-native  secondary  structures.  As  a  second  step,  the  ITS2  foldingpatterns  of  closely  or  distantly  related  taxa  were  compared,  i.e.were  screened  for  similarities  as  well  as  for  compensatory  basechanges  (CBC).  These  two  procedures  successfully  revealedthe  ‘correct’  folding  pattern  of  all  ITS2  sequences  (see  Marinand  Melkonian  2010;  Subirana  et  al.  2013).Contribution  of  authorsAgathe  Martignier:  designed  and  led  the  research,conducted  the  SEM  work  and  EDXS  analyses,  ana-lyzed  the  data  and  wrote  the  article,  Sophie  deRespinis:  carried  out  DNA  extraction,  analyzed  thedata  and  drafted  part  of  the  manuscript,  Montser-rat  Filella:  worked  on  the  research  concept  andedited  the  manuscript,  Inés  Segovia-Campos:provided  SEM  images,  Birger  Marin:  producedthe  phylogenetic  trees  and  the  analysis  of  theITS2  secondary  structures  and  drafted  part  ofthe  manuscript,  Gerd  Günther:  provided  the  light16  A.

Zinc is one of the most important trace elements for life and its deﬁciency, like its
excess, can be fatal. In the bacterial opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa ,
Zn homeostasis is not only required for survival, but also for virulence and antibiotic
resistance. Thus, the bacterium possesses multiple Zn import/export/storage systems.
In this work, we determine the expression dynamics of the entire P . aeruginosa Zn
homeostasis network at both transcript and protein levels. Precisely, we followed
the switch from a Zn-deﬁcient environment, mimicking the initial immune strategy to
counteract bacterial infections, to a Zn-rich environment, representing the phagocyte
metal boost used to eliminate an engulfed pathogen. Thanks to the use of the
NanoString technology, we timed the global silencing of Zn import systems and the
orchestrated induction of Zn export systems. We show that the induction of Zn export
systems is hierarchically organized as a function of their impact on Zn homeostasis.
Moreover, we identify PA2807 as a novel Zn resistance component in P . aeruginosa and
highlight new regulatory links among Zn-homeostasis systems. Altogether, this work
unveils a sophisticated and adaptive homeostasis network, which complexity is key in
determining a pathogen spread in the environment and during host-colonization.

Zinc (Zn), commonly found as the divalent cation Zn2+, is a trace element primarily involved
as a cofactor of many enzymes and therefore essential for life. It is considered as the second most
important trace metal after iron (Fe) ( Blencowe and Morby ,2003 ). In prokaryotes, Zn is principally
found bound to proteins (approximately 6% of the proteome) and the free cellular fraction is kept at
a concentration as low as femtomolar ( Outten and O’Halloran ,2001 ). In excess, this metal becomes
toxic, especially by competing with other trace elements, giving rise to protein mismetallization
(Foster et al. ,2014 ). The equilibrium of cellular Zn concentration is therefore tightly regulated
and numerous systems involved in Zn homeostasis (and that of other divalent cations) are well-
described in several bacteria ( Chandrangsu et al. ,2017 ).

Ducret et al. Dynamics of Zinc Homeostasis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
The toxic properties of Zn are widely exploited in the context
of infection control. Upon bacterial invasion, one of the host
defense mechanisms is the sequestration of essential metal ions,
in particular Fe, Zn, and manganese (Mn), by proteins and
molecules, leading to so called “nutritional immunity” ( Kehl-
Fie and Skaar ,2010 ;Capdevila et al. ,2016 ;Lonergan and Skaar ,
2019 ). Conversely, during phagocytosis, toxic concentrations
of Zn and copper (Cu) are delivered into the phagolysosome,
participating in the destruction of the pathogen ( Sta ord
et al. ,2013 ;Gao et al. ,2018 ). Thus, to successfully infect,
microorganisms not only must adapt to environments of Zn
deprivation or excess, but also rapidly alternate between these two
extreme conditions. The opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an ubiquitous and versatile bacterium
that possesses several systems for Zn homeostasis ( Figure 1A ).
P. aeruginosa is responsible for a wide array of severe infections,
particularly in cystic ﬁbrosis and immunocompromised patients
(Kerr and Snelling ,2009 ), and Zn homeostasis systems are highly
relevant to its pathogenicity ( Gonzalez et al. ,2019 ). Notably,
they modulate virulence by acting on quorum sensing ( Dieppois
et al. ,2012 ) as well as antibiotic resistance by repressing the
expression of the route of entry for carbapenem antibiotics
(Perron et al. ,2004 ).
Numerous systems are involved in the import of Zn into
P. aeruginosa (Pederick et al. ,2015 ). At ﬁrst, the TonB-dependent
receptors ZnuD and PA2911 interact with its energizing TonB-
ExbBD protein complex to translocate extracellular Zn into the
periplasmic space ( Gonzalez et al. ,2019 ). Subsequently, the metal
crosses the cytoplasmic membrane via either the P-type ATPase
HmtA or via an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter such
as ZnuABC, the most common Zn uptake pathway in bacteria
(Pederick et al. ,2015 ). Revealed for the ﬁrst time in Escherichia
coli, this transporter consists of the solute-binding protein (SBP)
ZnuA, which scavenges Zn in the periplasm with a high a  nity
and brings it to the inner membrane permease ZnuB. The energy
required for this transport is provided by the cytoplasmic ATPase
ZnuC ( Patzer and Hantke ,1998 ).
Two additional ABC transporters have been described in
P. aeruginosa : PA4063-PA4066 and PA2912-PA2914 ( Pederick
et al. ,2015 ). Although these transporters have been shown to
be overexpressed under conditions of Zn limitation, they remain
poorly characterized and their exact contribution to Zn uptake
remains to be elucidated.
The ZrmABCD system has recently been designated as
a new Zn acquisition system, involving a nicotianamine-
related zincophore called pseudopaline by similarity to the
Staphylococcus aureus staphylopine ( Lhospice et al. ,2017 ;
Mastropasqua et al. ,2017 ). The molecule is synthetized by the
ZrmB and ZrmC cytoplasmic enzymes and then released outside
the cell by the EamA-like transporter ZrmD. Internalization
of the Zn-pseudopaline complex is mediated by the TonB-
dependent receptor ZrmA, in a siderophore-like manner
(McFarlane and Lamb ,2017 ). Though many gaps remain to
be ﬁlled at the mechanical level, the importance of this system
under conditions of Zn limitation and its involvement in bacterial
pathogenicity appear evident, especially in a cystic ﬁbrosis
context ( Hermansen et al. ,2018 ).A considerable reservoir of Zn is represented by ribosomal
proteins. Indeed, during nutrient deprivation, P. aeruginosa
copes with metal deﬁciency by expressing additional ribosomal
paralogous proteins, annotated as C  , which have lost
their Zn ﬁnger domain ( Haas et al. ,2009 ;Gonzalez et al. ,
2019 ). A release of Zn probably results from this exchange
phenomenon, that can be used by other proteins such as
DNA polymerase, primase, etc. The P. aeruginosa PA3600-
PA3601 operon encodes two C  paralogs, RpmE2 and
RpmJ2, able to substitute in place and in function the
ribosomal proteins RpmE and RpmJ, respectively. Recent
data from E. coli have shown that RpmE2 and RpmJ2 are
of comparable e  ciency to their Zn-ribbon paralogs ( Ueta
et al. ,2020 ). Such a strategy is also observed with the global
transcription regulator DksA, involved in the stringent response.
Under Zn-scarce conditions, the alternative protein DksA2,
devoid of a Zn ﬁnger domain, is induced and takes over the
functional relay from its paralog DksA ( Blaby-Haas et al. ,
2011 ;Furman et al. ,2013 ). The dksA2 gene is found in a
Zn-regulated cluster composed of approximately 10 genes
including two encoding C  paralog enzymes, pyrC2 andfolE2
(Pederick et al. ,2015 ).
Zinc uptake and storage systems are regulated by the one-
component regulator Zn uptake regulator (Zur) protein, that
belongs to the ferric uptake regulatory (FUR) protein family.
Zur senses the cytoplasmic concentration of the metal and
its regulatory function is directly related to its ability to
reversibly bind Zn ( Ellison et al. ,2013 ;Gonzalez et al. ,2019 ).
Under conditions of Zn su  ciency or excess, the regulator is
found in a dimeric form containing four Zn atoms (Zur2-
Zn4 conformation), which promotes DNA binding and ensures
the repression of target genes by preventing RNA polymerase
from initiating transcription. In P. aeruginosa , nine Zur
binding sites were predicted, characterized by a 17-nucleotide
palindromic motif overlapping the  10 of the promoter region
(Pederick et al. ,2015 ).
Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the ability to counter high
toxic concentrations of Zn. Three families of export systems
have been described in this bacterium, including the CzcCBA
e ux pump, a homolog of the system found in the metal-
resistant bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans (Nies et al. ,1989 ).
CzcCBA belongs to the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND)
group of the Heavy Metal E  ux (HME) family, capable of
expelling excess Zn, cadmium (Cd) and cobalt (Co) from the
cytoplasmic or periplasmic compartments directly outside the
cell ( Goldberg et al. ,1999 ). This pump is regulated by the CzcRS
two-component system (TCS), where CzcS is the transmembrane
sensor and CzcR is the response regulator. CzcS detects and
becomes active under conditions of excess periplasmic Zn
or Cd. It then activates CzcR by phosphorylation, which in
turn acts as a transcriptional activator of the e  ux system,
ensuring detoxiﬁcation of the cell. Additionally, CzcRS TCS
has been shown to activate its own transcription, promoting
a positive regulation loop, but also to directly repress the
OprD porin, the route of carbapenem entry, thus rendering
the bacterium resistant to these antibiotics ( Perron et al. ,2004 ;
Dieppois et al. ,2012 ).

inµg/g cells (dry weight) were determined over time in the wild type strain by ICP-MS. The concentration of Cu, as control, is also plotted on the graph.
Moreover, the bacterium possesses two cation di  usion
facilitators (CDF), CzcD, and YiiP. These systems act as a
homodimer or heterodimer to expel Zn from the cytoplasm to
the periplasm by way of a proton gradient. They also appear to
be involved in maintaining membrane integrity, which would
explain why mutants deleted for these CDFs are more sensitive
to several antibiotics ( Salusso and Raimunda ,2017 ).
A ﬁnal layer consists of the P-type ATPase CadA, which is also
responsible for detoxifying the cytoplasm by expelling Zn to the
periplasm. In P. aeruginosa , CadA was ﬁrst described as a system
involved in Cd resistance ( Lee et al. ,2001 ). Similar to the E. coliZntA, this protein has recently been shown to be essential for
Zn resistance ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ). CadA is regulated by CadR
that belongs to the MerR family of response regulators. CadR
is constitutively expressed and has a high a  nity for the cadA
promoter in the apo and holo forms. The activity of this regulator
is directly linked to its ability to bind Zn since it plays the dual role
of repressor and activator of cadA transcription, depending on
whether it is in conditions of Zn limitation or excess, respectively
(Ducret et al. ,2020 ).
Numerous strategies allowing Zn homeostasis have been
described and characterized in P. aeruginosa . All these systems

Ducret et al. Dynamics of Zinc Homeostasis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
serve to ensure the survival of the bacterium in environments
that are limited or contaminated with Zn and, interestingly,
make the link between metallostasis, virulence and antibiotic
resistance. Knowledge of how these systems interact with each
other, however, is scarce.
Our lab previously highlighted a dynamic in the expression of
Zn export systems in P. aeruginosa . Indeed, we had shown that
the P-type ATPase CadA was not only the ﬁrst line of protection
against a boost in Zn, but also facilitated the induction of the
major export system, the CzcCBA e  ux pump ( Ducret et al. ,
2020 ). These results support the hypothesis that the di  erent
systems involved in Zn resistance are not redundant, but follow a
precise strategic plan, guaranteeing a rapid adaptation of the cell
to variations in Zn concentrations.
The purpose of this study was to follow up on the “strategic
plan” hypothesis and assess the dynamics of all the systems
involved in Zn homeostasis (import/export/storage) when the
bacterium transitions from starvation to surfeit, as it happens
during an infection. To achieve this aim, we made use of the
NanoString technology, which allows the direct counting of
several mRNAs simultaneously by using digital bar-coded probe
pairs ( Geiss et al. ,2008 ). We could therefore quantify transcripts
of all Zn homeostasis systems, rather than following a single
element of the system, and follow their dynamics over time.
While we clearly observed a global import systems repression,
a hierarchical induction of the export systems appeared. An
additional novel partner of the Zn resistance, PA2807, a CzcE-like
protein, was also discovered and characterized. Finally, the rapid
induction of carbapenem resistance via OprD porin repression in
the presence of Zn was precisely analyzed at the transcriptomic
and proteomic levels.
RESULTS
In order to monitor the dynamics of Zn transport systems when
P. aeruginosa switches from a situation of Zn starvation to Zn
excess, we designed an experimental procedure described in
Figure 1B . Brieﬂy, P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain was cultivated at
37 C in a Zn-depleted medium (M-LB) containing 30 µM TPEN
[N,N,N0,N0-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine] to
chelate all residual Zn for 2 h 30 min ( Ellison et al. ,2013 ). Then,
2 mM ZnCl 2(ﬁnal concentration) was added to the culture.
Previous to Zn addition (t0) and at di  erent times afterward,
cells were sampled for proteomic, transcriptomic, and Zn
content analysis.
At protein levels we observed, as expected, a signiﬁcant
increase of all export systems during the ﬁrst hour of high
Zn exposure, while surprisingly the level of only two proteins
involved in Zn import, ZrmB and PA1925, decreased more than
50% ( Figure 1C andSupplementary Table 1 ). Indeed, the large
majority of uptake systems signiﬁcantly dropped only between 1
and 5 h after Zn addition. During this time frame, the amount
of the CadA P-type ATPase decreased slightly in agreement with
our previous observations on its role of early player in case
of a sudden Zn excess ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ). The 5 h-period
was also marked by the increasing of the CzcD protein. ThisTABLE 1 | List of the twenty-ﬁve genes monitored for zinc homeostasis analysis.

very late induction took place after the CzcCBA e  ux rise and
may explain why this CDF was not essential for Zn resistance
(Ducret et al. ,2020 ).
When looking at the intracellular Zn concentration over time,
the values changed from 0.014 to 0.14 µM in 15 min, then
returned to equilibrium at a concentration of approximately
0.04 µM after 60 min ( Figure 1D ). It thus appears that the rapid
induction of e  ux systems prevails over the slow repression of
import systems and it is su  cient to counteract the Zn overﬂow.
Finally, to decipher early events of regulation of the Zn
homeostasis network, we directly monitored the transcript
levels of genes involved in Zn transport using the NanoString
technology ( Geiss et al. ,2008 ). Twenty-ﬁve oligonucleotide
probes targeting mRNAs of the known Zn import/export/storage
systems of P. aeruginosa were designed ( Table 1 ). In
addition, four probes targeting housekeeping genes were also
designed for data normalization ( Supplementary Table 2 ).
In case of a system encoded by operon, we selected at
least one gene probe to represent the whole transcription
unit (e.g., czcA and czcC were chosen to monitor the
expression of the czcCBA operon). For this analysis, RNA
was extracted at t0 and 30 s, 1, 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min
(t0.5, t1, 2, 5, 13, and 60, respectively) after Zn addition
(Figure 1B ). The mRNA copy number for each of the
target genes was then calculated in each sample, as shown
inSupplementary Table 3 .

Zn Export Systems
Dynamics of CadA and CzcCBA Expression
We recently showed that the two most important systems
involved in Zn resistance in P. aeruginosa are the CadA P-Type
ATPase and the CzcCBA RND e  ux pump ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ).
These two systems interact together to produce an optimal
response to Zn excess, cadA being rapidly induced, followed by
czcCBA expression. Afterward, cadA expression decreased while
czcCBA reached its maximal expression ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ).
The cadA and czcCBA expression dynamic is also clearly
visible in the NanoString experiment presented here ( Figure 2A ),
thus conﬁrming that this method is suitable for the ﬁne
monitoring of gene expression during the low-to-high Zn
concentration transition.
After only 1 min, the amount of cadA mRNA rose to more
than 20,000 transcripts, corresponding to a 50-fold induction
(Figure 2A ). The quantity of mRNA increased up to 5 min,
reached a plateau, then decreased after 60 min ( Figure 2A ).
Interestingly, a basal level of cadA was detected even under
Zn-depleted conditions (t0) with more than 400 transcripts per
50 ng of total RNA ( Supplementary Table 3 ). The levels of
czcA and czcC transcripts (last and ﬁrst gene of the czcCBA
operon) reached their maximum after 30 min. After 1 h in thepresence of the metal, a fold induction higher than 330 for
czcA and higher than 4,700 for czcC was observed. Looking at
the number of transcripts ( Supplementary Table 3 ), we noticed
that, unlike czcC,czcA was already present under conditions
of Zn limitation. Moreover, the number of czcA mRNA copies
detected after 1 h in the presence of the metal was twice higher
than that of czcC. Altogether, this suggested a transcriptional
independence of czcA that could be mediated viaan internal
transcriptional start site (iTSS) within the czcCBA operon ( Guell
et al. ,2011 ). A similar situation has been observed in the czc
operon of C. metallidurans , giving rise to di  erent polycistronic
mRNAs, some constitutively expressed and additionally inducible
in a CzcR-dependent manner ( Grosse et al. ,2004 ).
CzcD Is Part of the CzcRS Regulon
CzcD and YiiP are two cation di  usion facilitators (CDF) that
export Zn from the cytosol to the periplasm ( Salusso and
Raimunda ,2017 ). Both showed low basal expression even before
Zn addition ( Supplementary Table 3 ). However, the level of yiip
mRNA did not increase upon Zn treatment, while czcD displayed
a 26-fold induction, visible after 30 min ( Figure 2B ).
Since czcD is located on the czclocus in C. metallidurans (Nies
et al. ,1989 ), we wanted to determine whether czcD is part of the

Ducret et al. Dynamics of Zinc Homeostasis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
CzcRS-mediated regulation. For this purpose, we constructed a
transcriptional fusion containing the czcD promoter controlling
agfp(green ﬂuorescent protein). The expression of the fusion
was tested in the wild type (WT) and 1czcRS mutant strain in
presence of 2 mM of ZnCl 2. Similarly to what is observed for
theczcC promoter ( Perron et al. ,2004 ), we could show that czcD
expression depends on the CzcRS TCS since no ﬂuorescence was
detected after Zn induction in the 1czcRS mutant ( Figure 2C ).
This result was also conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR ( Figure 2D ). The fact
thatczcD gene induction is weaker than czcCBA (Supplementary
Table 3 ) might reﬂect its secondary role in Zn resistance ( Salusso
and Raimunda ,2017 ;Ducret et al. ,2020 ). Altogether, these results
suggest that czcD is part of the CzcRS regulon.
PA2807, a Novel Link Between Zn and Cu
Homeostasis
InC. metallidurans , the czcelement consists of nine genes with a
czcNICBADRSE organization ( Grosse et al. ,2004 ). We searched
for conserved amino acid sequences in P. aeruginosa using
DIAMOND ( Buchﬁnk et al. ,2015 ). No signiﬁcant CzcI and CzcN
homologs were identiﬁed. Instead, at low stringency, we found
that the PA2807 protein possesses two regions of approximately
40% sequence identity to C. metallidurans CzcE ( Figure 3A ). In
C. metallidurans , CzcE is a periplasmic protein that has been
shown to bind Cu but whose expression is also induced by Zn
independently of the CzcDRS regulatory element ( Grosse et al. ,
2004 ;Zoropogui et al. ,2008 ). Using SignalP 5.0 software ( Nielsen ,
2017 ), a putative signal peptide of 48 amino acids that targets
PA2807 to the periplasm is predicted with a probability of 0.47
(Figure 3A ). To conﬁrm the prediction, we tested the localization
of a C-terminal 6His-tagged PA2807 protein expressed in trans
inP. aeruginosa and we found that it was strongly enriched in
the periplasmic fraction ( Figure 3B ). The amino acid comparison
with CzcE from C. metallidurans showed that PA2807 possesses
an additional sequence of approximately 70 amino acids between
the two conserved regions that contains 7 His residues and may
constitute a metal binding site ( Figure 3A ).
Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA2807 is described as a protein of
the cupredoxin family and has been shown to be involved in Cu
resistance ( Quintana et al. ,2017 ). No e  ect on Zn resistance,
however, was observed in a disk assay ( Teitzel et al. ,2006 ). To
assess whether in our experimental settings the PA2807 protein
is involved in Zn and/or Cu tolerance, we deleted this gene in
aP. aeruginosa PAO1 strain and monitored the growth of the
1PA2807 mutant in the presence of 3 mM CuCl 2or 5 mM ZnCl 2,
as compared to the wild type strain ( Figure 3C ). The growth
of1PA2807 mutant was clearly delayed, indicating that the
protein is indeed contributing to both Cu and Zn resistance. The
mutant growth deﬁciency could be complemented by expressing
thePA2807 gene on a plasmid ( Figure 3C ). The involvement of
PA2807 in Cu and Zn resistance was also conﬁrmed on plate,
using serial dilutions spotted on LB plates containing 5 mM
ZnCl 2or 3 mM CuCl 2(Supplementary Figure 1 ).
To determine whether the transcription of PA2807 could
be induced by Zn, we measured its transcript levels via the
NanoString analysis. Surprisingly, it turned out to be the most
induced gene, almost 10,000 times after 1 h of induction(Supplementary Table 3 ).PA2807 is part of a gene cluster
comprised of ptrA (PA2806 ),PA2807, andqueF (PA2808 ) next to
the CopRS TCS (PA2809-PA2810) ( Quintana et al. ,2017 ). PtrA
is a small periplasmic protein involved in Cu resistance that has
been shown to be also strongly induced in the presence of Zn
(Elsen et al. ,2011 ;Lei et al. ,2020 ). Using semi-quantitative RT-
PCR, we found that the PA2807 gene is co-transcribed as an
operon with ptrA (Supplementary Figure 2 ). Interestingly, the
ptrA-PA2807 transcript expression is not only induced by CopRS
in the presence of Cu, but also in a CzcRS-dependent manner in
presence of Zn, as shown by qRT-PCR ( Figure 3D ).
Altogether, these results demonstrated that the PA2807
protein of P. aeruginosa shares several characteristics with
C. metallidurans CzcE and appears to be part of the CzcRS
regulon in the presence of Zn.
Hierarchy in the Expression of Export Systems
The induction of the expression of these four Zn export systems,
namely the CadA P-type ATPase, The RND CzcCBA, the two
CDFs CzcD and Yiip, along with the newly discovered CzcE
homolog, PA2807, showed a precise chronology of induction, as
represented in Supplementary Figure 3 . Among all the export
systems tested, cadA was the ﬁrst to be induced (1 min, early
induced gene). The rapid induction is probably due to the
CadR regulator already bound to the cadA promoter region
and therefore ready to transcribe cadA in the event of Zn
excess ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ). The czcregulon containing the
czcCBA e ux pump, czcD andPA280 7(czcE-like) induced later
(15–30 min, late induced genes), while the gene encoding the
CDF yiiP showed no induction under the conditions tested
(uninduced gene).
Zn Uptake Systems
Unlike the protein levels ( Figure 1C ), the mRNA levels of
Zn import systems were strongly and rapidly repressed once
Zn was added to the medium ( Supplementary Figure 3 and
Supplementary Table 3 ). Contrarily to export systems, however,
no hierarchy in the regulation was evident and the decrease
in the mRNA abundance of all uptake systems was statistically
relevant ( p-value 0.001) between 2 and 5 min after Zn addition
(Figure 4 ). One exception to this reduction was observed with
the gene encoding the P-type ATPase HmtA, whose mRNA level
remained constantly low ( Supplementary Table 3 ). This lack of
repression could be due to the fact that this system is mainly
involved in Cu import ( Lewinson et al. ,2009 ). Finally, among the
three ABC transporters involved in Zn uptake, the PA4063-4066
system showed the highest expression ( Supplementary Table 3 ).
C and C +Paralog Proteins
Under conditions of Zn deﬁciency, the stringent response
regulator DksA is replaced by its DksA2 ortholog, which is devoid
of a Zn ﬁnger domain (C  form) ( Blaby-Haas et al. ,2011 ).
When Zn reaches su  cient cytoplasmic concentration, dksA2
transcription is switched o  by Zur and DksA takes over its place
and function. In agreement with this, a rapid drop in the level
ofdksA2 mRNA was observed: after 1 min of metal exposure
only half of the number of mRNAs remained ( Figure 5A and

Supplementary Table 3 ). A similar repression proﬁle was shown
for the two ribosomal genes rpmE2 and rpmJ 2 encoding Zn
deﬁcient orthologs of RpmE and RpmJ, respectively. Unlike their
C substitutes, the mRNA levels of dksA ,rpmE, andrpmJ remain
constant, indicating the simultaneous expression of the three
orthologous genes when the environment is depleted of metal.
Are both C +and C  proteins expressed at the same time or an
additional regulatory mechanism occur at the next levels of gene
expression? To address this question, we looked at the proteomic
analysis focusing on the DksA and RpmE proteins (RpmJ was not
detected) and their C  orthologs ( Figure 5B andSupplementary
Table 2 ). Intriguingly we observed that, while RpmE2 and DksA2
disappeared rapidly when Zn is added in excess, the proteinsRpmE and DksA remain present, even in the absence of Zn.
A similar regulation is also observed with the two zur-regulated
enzymes ( Pederick et al. ,2015 ), FolE (GTP cyclohydrolase) and
PyrC (dihydroorotase) whose concentrations remain constant
in the absence and presence of Zn, while their C  orthologs,
FolE2 and PyrC2 decrease as soon as excess Zn is added to the
medium ( Figure 5B ).
Zur Afﬁnity
The transcriptional repression of Zn import systems as well as
the genes encoding C  proteins are mediated by Zur. A Zur
box was predicted for each of the repressed genes or operons
(Pederick et al. ,2015 ) and Zur was shown to directly bind to

theznuA anddksA2 promoters ( Blaby-Haas et al. ,2011 ;Ellison
et al. ,2013 ). In P. aeruginosa this repressor is characterized by
2 Zn binding sites, the structural site located in the C-terminal
region and a regulatory M-site ( Ellison et al. ,2013 ). The Zur
dimer contains 2 Zn2+ions at the structural site and depending
on the cytoplasmic Zn concentration, 0, 1, or 2 Zn2+ions at
the regulatory M-site. In Bacillus subtilis , Zur promoter a  nity
depends on the amount of Zn linked to the regulatory site of the
protein, allowing a ﬁne cellular response to Zn by precisely tuning
Zur action ( Ma et al. ,2011 ).
No clear hierarchy in the repression of Zur regulated
genes could be observed with the NanoString experiment
after addition of 2 mM ZnCl 2(Supplementary Figure 3 and
Supplementary Table 3 ). We therefore used a more reﬁnedanalysis to investigate a possible hierarchy in the a  nity of the
Zur regulator for the various putative Zur targets in P. aeruginosa .
To this aim, we puriﬁed Zur ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) and
carried out Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) assays,
in the absence (30 µM TPEN) or presence of Zn (5 µM
ZnCl 2)(Figure 6 ).
All the promoters tested were shifted, including the promoter
of the PA2439 gene (ﬁrst gene of the locus containing hmtA ),
for which a weak putative Zur binding site had previously been
determined in silico (Pederick et al. ,2015 ). Interestingly, two
distinct target proﬁles were emerging from the EMSA analysis.
One set of targets exhibited a complete DNA-Zur interaction
only in the presence of Zn ( znuA ,znuD ,PA4063, PA2439, and
rpmE2 promoters), while the other showed binding even in the

FIGURE 6 | Zur binds to the diverse zurbox with different afﬁnities. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using puriﬁed Zur protein and the different target promoters.
TheczcD promoter ( pczcD ) was used as a negative control. 30 ng of DNA were mixed with (1) 0 nM of Zur, 5 µM ZnCl 2; (2) 500 nM Zur and 30 µM TPEN (Zn
depleted condition); and (3) 500 nM Zur and 5 µM ZnCl 2, as indicated. Reactions were loaded on non-denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, stained with ethidium
bromide and viewed under UV light.
absence of metal. This latter case represented the promoters of
thePA1922 ,PA2911, andzrmA genes, which encode for TonB-
dependent receptor components ( Pederick et al. ,2015 ) and the
dksA2 gene, involved in stringent response under Zn starvation
conditions ( Blaby-Haas et al. ,2011 ).
Induction of Carbapenem Resistance
The response to Zn in P. aeruginosa is linked to carbapenem
antibiotic resistance. The route of entry of these antibiotics into
the cell is the OprD porin, whose expression is repressed in the
presence of Zn at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
level via the CzcRS TCS and the Hfq RNA chaperone, respectively
(Perron et al. ,2004 ;Ducret et al. ,2016 ). Recently, we found
that the metal concentrations present in phagolysosomes are
su cient to induce the Zn response and therefore carbapenem
resistance in P. aeruginosa (Ducret et al. ,2020 ). We then followed
the kinetics of carbapenem resistance induction by quantifying
oprD downregulation at the mRNA and protein levels ( Figure 7 ).
A delay of 30 min was su  cient to observe a signiﬁcant drop inoprD mRNA levels ( Figure 7A ) and the protein was only slightly
present (less than 20%) after 5 h of induction ( Figure 7B and
Supplementary Table 1 ). This drop was also conﬁrmed at protein
levels by a Western blot experiment, where the protein was no
longer detectable after 3 h of metal addition ( Figure 7C ).
DISCUSSION
To infect and take advantage of its host, a pathogen must be able
to adapt quickly to extreme conditions, including rapid changes
in Zn concentration. P. aeruginosa is typically a bacterium armed
to counter this kind of situations, as shown by the numerous
systems involved in Zn homeostasis. These systems, together
with the ability to express them in a timely fashion, contribute
toP. aeruginosa ability to infect hosts ( Gonzalez et al. ,2019 ).
In this study, we carried out a systematic investigation of the
expression dynamics of the entire P. aeruginosa Zn homeostasis
network when switching from a Zn depleted environment to a

Zn excess situation, a transition mimicking what happens during
an infectious process ( Djoko et al. ,2015 ). Our analysis allowed
us to draw a global model of Zn homeostasis gene expression
organization in P aeruginosa , as illustrated in Figure 8 .
As a ﬁrst reaction, we observed a quick induction of cadA
expression (after 1 min). Presumably, this serves to rapidly
evacuate the Zn excess out of the cytoplasm into the periplasm
(Ducret et al. ,2020 ). Downregulation of transcripts for uptake
systems is also occurring fast, probably to prevent new Zn ions
from entering the cell. Surprisingly, at the protein level this
repression is visible only after 5 h, suggesting a slow turnoverof Zn uptake proteins. Given the importance of Zn for survival,
this might be the result of a “prudential regulatory strategy, ” to
assure a prompt Zn uptake in case of the metal concentration
decreases suddenly.
In a second step, the CzcCBA major e  ux system is induced
to detoxify all the cellular compartments, thus allowing the
bacterium to thrive in an environment highly contaminated with
Zn. In agreement with this, a decrease in total cellular Zn is
observed as the expression of czcCBA increases ( Figure 1D ). The
CzcD CDF is not an essential component in metal resistance
(Ducret et al. ,2020 ), but we show here to be part of the czcRS

FIGURE 8 | Representation of the dynamics of Zn homeostasis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ﬁrst block represents the intracellular Zn concentration, which
increases when the cells move from a Zn-poor to a Zn-rich environment. An increase in intracellular Zn concentration is observed for up to 15 min, the time it takes
for the import systems to be repressed and for the export system to start to eliminate the excess Zn (see second block and discussion). Later it appears that the
ATP-consuming CadA system, is replaced by a less energy-demanding CzcD system that takes over to pump cytoplasmic Zn into the periplasm. This
representation, highlights the repression of the expression of the OprD porin whose abundance is inversely proportional to resistance to the family of carbapenem
antibiotics (last block).
regulon ( Figure 2 ) and therefore responding to the periplasmic
Zn concentration. Considering its late induction, CzcD may
contribute to the maintenance of a steady state level of Zn
resistance by continuing to pump Zn into the periplasm and
allowing the CzcS to remain active while cadA expression
decreases. One may consider that the P-type ATPase system
CadA, despite being very e  cient, uses ATP as an energy
source while CzcD is driven by proton-motive forces and,
therefore, might be more proﬁtable for the cell in terms of
energy optimization.
ThePA2807 gene was previously shown to be induced by the
CopRS system in the presence of Cu ( Quintana et al. ,2017 ).
Here, we show that it encodes a CzcE-like protein involved in Zn
resistance and also induced by the CzcRS systems in the presence
of Zn. The role of this periplasmic protein in Zn and Cu resistance
requires further investigation, but we could conﬁrm the link
between Zn and Cu resistance that has already been observed in
other bacteria. For instance, in Pseudomonas stutzeri , a common
overlapping response to Cu and Zn by common regulator DNA
binding motifs has been elegantly demonstrated ( Garber et al. ,
2018 ). In P. aeruginosa , the induction of CopRS induces the
expression of the CzcRS TCS ( Caille et al. ,2007 ). In general,
both Zn and Cu resistance may allow bacteria to resist to the
toxic boost of metals that are discharged into the phagosome of
macrophages to kill the pathogens ( Botella et al. ,2012 ;Djoko
et al. ,2015 ). Shift assays have shown a greater a  nity of Zur for
promoters controlling the expression of PA1922 ,PA2911, zrmA,
anddksA2 genes. Interestingly, all these genes are also involved
in cobalt (Co) homeostasis, since PA1922 is located within an
operon that contains a cobN -like gene ( PA1923 ),PA2911 is co-
transcribed with PA2914 , a homolog of the cobalamin ABC
permease ( Pederick et al. ,2015 ) and pseudopaline, involving the
zrmsystem, has been shown to transport metals such as Zn, Co,
Fe, and nickel (Ni) ( Zhang et al. ,2019 ). Similarly, dksA2 is also
part of an operon including PA5535 ,acobW -like gene, involved
in cobalamin biosynthesis. These results might reveal a putative
Co-dependent regulatory activity of Zur, which could be linkedwith vitamin B12 (cobalamin) synthesis ( Osman et al. ,2021 ). Our
in vitro conditions, by creating a Zn deﬁciency using TPEN, could
displace the ﬁlling of Zur with Co ( Osman et al. ,2017 ). Some
promoters would thus also appear to react ﬁrst to a Co boost.
The analysis of the sequences of the di  erent Zur boxes did not
allow us to highlight any particular signature. The DNA-Zur-Co
interaction would deserve further investigation.
InE. coli , each of the 50,000 ribosomes present in
exponentially growing cell contains about 3 Zn2+ions, resulting
in the recruitment of 75% of all the intracellular Zn available
(Blaby-Haas et al. ,2011 ). Under conditions of Zn deﬁciency, the
ribosomal proteins RpmE and RpmJ, along with the transcription
factor DksA and the two enzymes FolE and PyrC all of which
contain Zn-ribbon motifs (and are thus called C +) are replaced
by their C  paralog proteins (RpmE2, RpmJ2 DksA2, FolE2,
and PyrC2), which lack the key Cys residues and do not
require Zn for their function. This replacement frees Zn, which
becomes available for other essential biological tasks ( Gabriel and
Helmann ,2009 ). A similar mechanism is found also in B. subtilis ,
in which the RpmE protein is degraded under Zn depleted
conditions ( Akanuma et al. ,2006 ). As expected we found a rapid
drop of C  proteins upon Zn excess in P. aeruginosa . However,
unlike B. subtilis ,P. aeruginosa C+proteins are constitutively
present even in conditions of Zn deﬁciency (t0). It is possible
that the presence of these proteins reﬂects a regulatory strategy
that guarantees a pool of proteins rapidly functional as soon as
Zn is available.
In summary, this work shows for the ﬁrst time the dynamics of
the components of the Zn homeostasis network in P. aeruginosa.
The use of the NanoString technology allowed us to precisely
quantify several transcripts simultaneously and to follow their
dynamics over time. The complementary proteomic analyses
allowed us to observe the ﬁnal outcome of this regulation and
to visualize the Zn homeostasis systems at steady state (i.e.,
after 5 h of growth in presence of Zn excess). Our ﬁndings
are important to identify the molecular mechanisms favoring
host colonization and infection, as well as to understand the

environmental signals leading to the insurgence of antibiotic
resistance. Speciﬁcally, the CzcRS-dependent repression of the
oprD porin renders P. aeruginosa resistant to carbapenem in
presence of Zn ( Perron et al. ,2004 ). According to our data,
the OprD protein cannot be detected by western blot after
3 h of Zn treatment ( Figure 7C ). We have recently reported
OrpD repression during phagocytosis ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ).
Macrophages, and in general the immune system response,
could therefore represent an important underestimated cause of
carbapenem phenotypic resistance. Understanding the molecular
mechanism favoring the appearance of carbapenem resistance
will be thus fundamental to optimize the use of these last
resort antibiotics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains and Culture Media
The bacterial strains and plasmids used for this study are
listed in Supplementary Table 4 . Cultures requiring initial Zn
deﬁciency conditions were carried out in modiﬁed Luria-Bertani
medium (AppliChem) supplemented with 30 µM of N,N,N0,N0-
tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN, Biotum),
as described previously ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ). Otherwise standard
Luria Broth medium (AppliChem) was used. Cultures were
incubated at 37 C and when required, antibiotics were added
to the medium at the following concentrations: 200 µg/mL
carbenicillin (Cb, phytotechlab), 50 µg/mL Gentamycin (Gm,
AppliChem) and 50 µg/mL tetracycline (Tc, Axxora) for
P. aeruginosa or 100 µg/mL ampicillin (Ap, AppliChem) and
15µg/mL Tc or Gm for E. coli .
Genetic Manipulations
DNA cloning was performed according to standard procedures
(Sambrook and Russell ,2001 ). For Polymerase Chain Reactions,
P. aeruginosa genomic DNA was used as template and the
primers are listed in Supplementary Table 5 . Restriction and
ligation enzymes (Promega) were employed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting recombinant plasmids
were inserted into E. coli DH5 aand conﬁrmed by sequencing
prior to being transformed into the P. aeruginosa wild type or the
indicated mutant strains by electroporation ( Choi et al. ,2006 ).
Mutants were created according to the following strategy: two
fragments ﬂanking either the PA2807 or the copRS TCS locus
were ampliﬁed by PCR, digested with EcoRI/KpnI for the ﬁrst
insert and KpnI/BamHI for the second insert and ligated into the
corresponding sites of the pME3087 suicide vector ( Voisard et al. ,
1994 ). After sequencing veriﬁcation, recombinant plasmids were
transformed into P. aeruginosa wild type strain. Merodiploids
were resolved as previously mentioned ( Ye et al. ,1995 ) and
the speciﬁc chromosomal deletions were conﬁrmed by PCR
ampliﬁcation and sequencing.
For complementation of the 1PA2807 mutant, the full PA2807
gene was ampliﬁed by PCR, digested with EcoRI and BamHI
restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of
the IPTG-inducible pMMB66EH vector ( Furste et al. ,1986 ). The
PA2807 gene was also cloned with a C-terminal 6His tag intothe pME6001 promoter-less vector ( Blumer et al. ,1999 ). To this
aim, the full gene and its promoter region were obtained by PCR
and inserted into the pME6001 plasmid between the BamHI and
HindIII restriction sites. For czcD::gfp fusion, the czcD promoter
was ampliﬁed by PCR, digested with the KpnI and BglII enzymes
and then ligated in the corresponding sites of the pBRR1- gfp
plasmid ( Ouahrani-Bettache et al. ,1999 ).
RNA Extraction
Total RNA was isolated from the P. aeruginosa wild type or
mutant strains as formerly explained ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ). Brieﬂy,
overnight cultures were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm
(OD 600) of 0.1 and grown for 2 h 30 min in M-LB containing
30µM TPEN. 0.5 mL of each culture was mixed with 1 mL of
RNA Bacteria Protect Reagent (Qiagen) immediately after 2 mM
ZnCl 2induction (t0) and after several time points as indicated in
the di  erent ﬁgures. Total RNAs were extracted with an RNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
5µg of total RNA were treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNAse
(Promega) for 2 h at 37 C, followed by phenol/chloroform
extraction and ethanol precipitation.
NanoString nCounter Expression
Analysis
mRNA content was analyzed at the iGE3 Genomics Platform
(Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva). 50 ng of total RNA
were hybridized with multiplexed NanoString probes listed in
Supplementary Table 2 and samples were processed according
to the published procedure ( Geiss et al. ,2008 ). Barcodes were
counted for 490 ﬁelds of view per sample. Background correction
was performed by subtracting the mean +2 standard deviations
of the negative controls for each sample. Values <1 were set
to 1. Positive controls were used as quality assessment: the
ratio between the highest and the lowest average of the positive
controls among samples was below 3. Counts for target genes
were then normalized with the geometric mean of the four
reference targets: fbp, ppiD, and rpoD , selected according to
Gi ord et al. (2016 )andoprF, usually used in the lab to normalize
RT-qPCR. The stability of these genes has been veriﬁed using the
geNorm algorithm ( Vandesompele et al. ,2002 ).
Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis
500 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random
hexamer primers (Promega) and Improm-II reverse transcriptase
(Promega) according to the supplier’s instructions. The reverse
transcriptase was then heat-inactivated and the resulting cDNAs
were diluted tenfold in water. Quantitative PCR was performed
in technical duplicates, using SYBR Select Master Mix (Applied
biosystem), according to the supplier’s instructions. Results were
analyzed as previously described ( Schmittgen and Livak ,2008 )
and normalized with the oprF gene.
Semi-Quantitative PCR Analysis
500 ng of total RNA from WT P. aeruginosa grown in LB,
LB supplemented with 2 mM ZnCl 2or with 2 mM CuCl 2
was reverse-transcribed as described above and diluted tenfold

in water. 28 cycles of PCR ampliﬁcation were performed on
the cDNAs and on the corresponding RNA dilution (negative
control) as well as on genomic DNA (positive control) using the
primers described in Supplementary Table 5 . Amplicons were
analyzed on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide
using a standard procedure.
GFP-Reporter Fusions
Green ﬂuorescent protein fusion assays were carried out as
previously described ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ). Precultures of wild
type and 1czcRS strains carrying the pczcC::gfp orpczcD::gfp
constructions were diluted to an OD 600of 0.1, transferred to a 96-
well black plate (Costar) and grown for 2.5 h with shaking before
being induced with 2 mM ZnCl 2(t0). Fluorescence at 528 nm
was measured every 15 min using a Microplate reader (Synergy
HT, BioTek instrument) and normalized with the OD 600values.
Growth Tests
Growth experiments were undertaken to investigate the metal
susceptibility of the 1PA2807 mutant strain compared to the
wild type, whether complemented or not with the PA2807 gene.
Overnight cultures of the di  erent strains were diluted to an
OD 600of 0.05 in LB medium containing 200 µg/mL carbenicillin
and 0.1 mM IPTG (isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside). For
growth curve analysis ( Figure 3C ), cultures were supplemented
or not with either 3 mM CuCl 2, or 5 mM ZnCl 2, transferred
to 96-well plates (Costar) and incubated at 37 C with shaking.
Absorbance at 600 nm was measured every 15 min using a
Microplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek instrument). For growth
spot assays ( Supplementary Figure 1 ), cultures were grown for
2 h in LB containing 200 µg/mL carbenicillin and 0.1 mM
isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Axon Lab), then
diluted to 10 7. 10µl of each dilution was spotted onto LB plates,
supplemented or not with either 3 mM CuCl 2or 5 mM ZnCl 2and
incubated at 37 C for 24 h.
Western Blot Analyses
For PA2807 cellular localization, a fractionation procedure was
adapted from Elsen et al. (2011 ). For this purpose, an overnight
culture of a WT strain containing the 6His-tagged PA2807
version was diluted to an OD 600of 0.1 in LB supplemented with
50µg/mL gentamycin and 2 mM CuCl 2. After 5 h of growth,
1 mL of cells was harvested and total proteins were solubilized
at 2 mg/mL in 2X SDS-gel sample bu  er (Sambrook and Russell ,
2001 ) (an OD 600of 1 gives 0.175 mg/mL of protein). In parallel,
15 mL of culture were washed once with TMP bu  er (10 mM
Tris–HCl, 200 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM AEBSF, pH8). Cells were then
resuspended in 1 mL TMP bu  er containing 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme
(Fluka) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before
spinning down. The supernatant corresponds to the periplasmic
fraction. The pellet, corresponding to membrane plus cytosolic
fractions, was resuspended in the same volume of TMP bu  er and
sonicated. Both fractions were mixed with an equal volume of 2X
SDS-gel sample bu  er.
In order to investigate the kinetics of OprD protein repression
over the time, an overnight WT P. aeruginosa culture was diluted
to an OD 600of 0.05 in M-LB supplemented with 30 µM TPENand incubated for 2 h 30 min at 37 C. 1 mL of culture was
collected and centrifuged immediately prior to being induced
with 2 mM ZnCl 2and each hour as indicated in Figure 7C . All
pellets were solubilized in the appropriate volume of 2X SDS-
gel sample bu  er to a total protein concentration of 2 mg/mL
(an OD 600of 1 gives 0.175 mg/mL protein). Proteins were
separated on SDS PAGE, using 4–12% precast gels (Invitrogen).
Membrane transfer was performed with an iBlot 2 transfer
stack (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with anti-OprD or anti-
penta-His and anti-Hsp70 antibodies as previously described
(Dieppois et al. ,2012 ). Blots were revealed by chemiluminescence
(SuperSignal, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), using the Amersham
Imager 680 System.
Intracellular Zn Concentration
The procedure was adapted from D’Orazio et al. (2015 ). An
overnight culture was diluted to an OD 600of 0.1 in M-LB
supplemented with 30 µM TPEN and incubated 2 h 30 min
at 37 C. 1 mL of cells were collected and washed once with
Phosphate Bu  ered Saline (PBS, Gibco) containing 1 mM EDTA
(Promega). The culture was then induced with 2 mM ZnCl 2
and a 1 mL-sample was collected at 5, 15, 30, and 60 min
after Zn addition and processed in the same manner, to remove
any traces of Zn. Pellets from the whole kinetic sequence were
deep-frozen, freeze-dried, and kept in the dark pending analyses.
Total dry material was transferred into polypropylene (PP) tubes
to perform acid digestion. This was done for 3 h at 90 C
placing the PP tubes on Teﬂon heating blocks after adding 2 mL
hydrochloric acid and 1 mL nitric acid (10 M HCl and 14 M
HNO 3, respectively, both Suprapur, MerckR ) following protocol
adapted from Abdou et al. (2020 )for trace metal quantiﬁcation
in biological matrices. Cooled digestates were then diluted in
10 mL MilliQR water and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min
(20 C). The supernatant was stored in acid-cleaned PP tubes.
Total Zn concentrations were quantiﬁed by Inductively Coupled
Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS, 7900 AgilentR ) in samples
diluted 10 fold with 1 % HNO 3. Copper (Cu) concentrations were
also quantiﬁed. Since no Certiﬁed Reference Material (CRM)
exist for trace metal content in bacteria; other certiﬁed biological
matrices were analyzed, consisting in plankton material and
seaweed (BCRR -414 and CDR 200, respectively). Their analyses
provided satisfactory results with recoveries for both Zn and Cu
concentrations >90% and precision of ⇠10% ( n= 6). At least
triplicate of each condition was analyzed (vertical error bars in the
graphics). Detection limits (3 ⇥blank standard deviation) was
estimated to 1.5 µg/g and 0.18 µg/g for Zn and Cu, respectively,
according to an OD 600of 1 resulting in 0.39 g L 1of cell dry
weight ( Glazyrina et al. ,2010 ).
Zur Expression and Puriﬁcation
The zur gene was ampliﬁed by PCR, cut with BamHI and
EcoRI restriction enzymes and cloned into the pGEX-2T vector.
The resulting plasmid was then transformed into the E. coli
BL21 strain. Induction and puriﬁcation were performed as
described previously for the CadR protein ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ).
After removal of the GST tag with the thrombin protease,

the protein was dialyzed-concentrated against PBS containing
1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 50% glycerol. Protein purity was
checked on SDS-Page (Bio-Rad) stained with Coomassie blue
(Supplementary Figure 4 ) and stored at  70 C until use.
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
(EMSA)
For the EMSA experiments, all DNA promoters indicated in
Figure 6 were obtained by PCR and puriﬁed on agarose gel.
Binding assays were performed according to the procedure
already described ( Ducret et al. ,2020 ). Brieﬂy, reactions were
performed with a mixture composed of the 5X Zn-less Binding
Bu er (50 mM Tris, 200 mM KCl, 50 mM MgCl 2, 5 mM DTT, and
25% Glycerol), 30 ng of DNA, a Zn excess (5 µM) or deﬁciency
(30µM TPEN) in presence or absence of 500 nM Zur protein and
incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were then
separated at 4 C on a 7.5% polyacrylamide native gel containing
2.5% glycerol in Tris Borate Bu  er. Binding capacity was analyzed
by staining the gel with 0.1% ethidium bromide and revealed with
UV light using a NuGenius instrument.
Proteomic Analyses
Expression of the DksA and RpmE C  ,C+, and OprD proteins
was investigated by label-free proteomic analysis. Brieﬂy, an
overnight culture of the WT P. aeruginosa strain was diluted
to an OD 600of 0.1 in M-LB supplemented with 30 µM TPEN
and incubated for 2 h 30 min at 37 C. 1 mL of culture was
collected immediately before (t0) and after 1 and 5 h induction
with 2 mM ZnCl 2. A culture pellet was resuspended in an
appropriate volume of 50 mM NH 4CO3bu er in order to adjust
the concentration to 0.5 mg/mL total proteins. Cells were digested
with 0.1% RapiGest SF Surfactant (Waters) for 30 min at 60 C
followed by 5 min at 100 C.
Extract contents were analyzed by ElectroSpray Ionization-
Liquid Chromatography–Mass/Mass Spectrometric (ESI-LC-
MS/MS) at the Proteomics Core Facility (Faculty of Medicine,
University of Geneva). Raw data were processed using Proteome
Discoverer 2.3 Software. Label-free quantiﬁcation was performed
using the “Top 3 precursor Intensity” method. Normalization was
applied as well as an ANOVA analysis of variance with Bonferroni
multiple test correction. A minimum of 105, corresponding to the
minimum detection value, was ﬁxed for targets with zero values.
Experimental Relevance and Statistical
Data
All experiments were performed, at least, in triplicate. For
tables and graph representations, mean values or fold changes
are shown in the ﬁgures, along with the standard deviations.
When indicated, statistical analysis was performed according the
Student’s t-test and signiﬁcance p-value was set to p0.001 (⇤⇤⇤).
For others, the ﬁgures show an indicative experiment.
