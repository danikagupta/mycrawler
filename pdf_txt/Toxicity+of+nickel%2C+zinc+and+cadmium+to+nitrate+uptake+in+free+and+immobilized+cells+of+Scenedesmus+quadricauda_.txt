Abstract
We examined the inﬂuences of three trace metals on the accumulation of a major nutrient (NO 3/C0)i nS cenedesmus quadricauda .A
comparative study on metal–nutrient interaction in free and immobilized states of algal cells was conducted. The effect due to
interaction between different variables (cell state type, metal type, and metal dose) was studied to assess the variation in the nitrate
uptake by free and immobilized cells. The results analyzed by ANOVA (three-way) (components: cell state type, metal type, andmetal dose) conﬁrmed that the inhibition of nitrate uptake by test metals was highly signiﬁcant ( Po0.001). Free and immobilized
states of S . quadricauda responded differently ( Po0.05, ANOVA) to the types of metal added. Uptake kinetics was studied by
monitoring short-term uptake rates at different nutrient levels. Free and immobilized cells of the organism displayed noncompetitive
modes of inhibition for Ni and Zn while a competitive mode of inhibition by Cd was observed in both free and immobilized states ofthe organism.

1. Introduction
Freshwater ecosystems are inﬂuenced by heavy metal
pollution ( Baun et al., 1998 ). The chemical forms of
these metals in water are accessible to the biota throughsigniﬁcant accumulation in the food chain. Toxicity of
heavy metals to algae has been reviewed earlier ( Gaur
and Rai, 1994 ). In addition to heavy metal pollution,
excess nitrate discharge is also attracting attention. Thenitrate threat to ground water comes from varioussources including nitrogen-based fertilizers, waste fromdairy and other livestock operations, and septic tanksystems, both residential and industrial ( Bier, 2002 ).
Many organisms including algae possess the ability to
incorporate nutrients very rapidly from the external
medium ( Forni et al., 2001 ). For total removal ofnitrogen, a biological process is more suitable than any
conventional technique. However, the use of algae as abiological material is restricted since it is difﬁcult toharvest algae for its use in sewage treatment. Recently,this problem was overcome by the use of immobilizedalgae (Lau et al., 1998 ). Immobilized biomass offers
many advantages including better reusability, high
biomass loading, and minimal clogging in continuousﬂow systems ( Zhang et al., 1998 ;Tam et al., 1998 ).
Nitrate uptake is an interaction between cells and
substrate similar to the interaction between enzymes andsubstrate in any biochemical process. In the presentstudy, nitrate serves as a substrate and is converted intoamine form (–NH
2). During this process, many sub-
stances (including heavy metals) may alter the uptake of
nutrients by combining with them in a way thatinﬂuences the binding of substrate by algal cells thusthey act as inhibitors. An inhibitor can compete directlywith the substrate for an enzymatic-binding siteARTICLE IN PRESS

enzyme or the enzyme–substrate complex (noncompeti-tive inhibition).
The study of nitrate uptake by algae becomes
important since algae can be used as an excellent
nutrient stripper, if properly managed. The presentanalysis will enable assessment of the extent and modeof inhibition of nitrate uptake in the immobilized stateof algal cells by heavy metals. A comparative study ofnutrient uptake kinetics in free and immobilized cells isalso signiﬁcant for assessing the superiority of immobi-lized cells, if any, over free cells. The presence of heavy
metals together with excess nutrients can cause inter-
ference in the nutrient removal process by algae. Thestudy was designed to evaluate whether metals presentin efﬂuents inhibit NO
3/C0uptake by imbedded algae more
so than that by free cells, thereby creating problems withefﬂuent treatment using imbedded cells.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Isolation, puriﬁcation, and culture
Eukaryotic green algae Scenedesmus quadricauda
(local isolate, Banaras Hindu University) was grown inmodiﬁed CHU-10 medium ( Gerloff et al., 1950 ). The pH
was maintained at 7.0 by using 2.0mM Tris (hydro-
xymethyl) methylene/HCl. Cultures from the logarith-
mic phase were used for toxicity tests. Stock solutions ofNiCl
2/C16H2O, ZnSO 4/C1H2O and CdSO 4/C1H2O were ﬁlter-
sterilized by passing through Millipore membrane ﬁlters(0.45mm) before addition to the culture medium. Test
metals were freshly prepared and the actual metalconcentrations used were the LC
50values determined
previously by the plate/colony count method based on
the survival of the test alga to 50%. The concentrations
were as follows:
Ni, 1.10, 2.10 (LC 50), and 3.10 mmolL/C01; Zn, 1.40,
2.40 (LC 50), and 3.40 mmolL/C01; Cd, 1.30, 2.30 (LC 50),
and 3.30 mmolL/C01.
The culture received 72mmol photonsm/C02s/C01PAR
light intensity at 24 721C. Standard microbial techni-
ques were employed for selection, isolation, and cloning
of algae in pure culture.
Protein value was estimated following the method of
Herbert et al. (1971) .
2.2. Bubble column reactor
A glass tube containing a ground-glass ﬁlter at the
bottom and sealed with a rubber stopper at the top was
used. A hollow rod was inserted through the stopper to
reach the bottom of the column. The tube was used topump air in the reactor. The column was aerated at250–300cc/min with an air bubbler. A hollow tube wasalso inserted sideways at the bottom to remove the
solution from the reactor at different time intervals.
2.3. Cell immobilization
Most methods for immobilization of biomaterials in
alginate beads basically involve two main steps. First,there is the internal phase where the alginate solutioncontaining biological materials is dispersed into smalldroplets. Secondly, the droplets are solidiﬁed by gellingor membrane formation at the droplet surface. This istermed the dialysis/diffusion method (diffusion setting)
as the alginate solution is gelled by diffusion of gelling
ions from an outer reservoir. The procedure is asfollows: Dissolve 30g of sodium alginate in 1L to makea 3% solution. Mix approximately 10mL of desiredprotein value algal culture with 10mL of 3% (wt.)sodium alginate solution. The concentration of sodiumalginate can be varied between 6% and 12% dependingon the desired hardness. The beads are formed by
dripping the polymer solution from a height of
approximately 20cm into an excess (100mL) of stirred0.2M CaCl
2solutions with a syringe and a needle at
room temperature. Pump pressure and the needle gaugecan control the bead size. A typical hypodermic needleproduces beads of 0.5–2mm in diameter. Other shapescan be obtained by using a mold whose wall ispermeable to calcium ions. Leave the beads in the
calcium solution to cure for 0.5–3h.
In the present study, exponentially grown algal cells
(500mg protein/mL) obtained by centrifugation and
repeated washings were suspended in 3% (w/v) solutionof sodium alginate (Sigma). The mixture was pumpeddropwise into CaCl
2(0.2M) solution. The beads thus
formed contained algal cells in an amount of 60 mg
protein per bead. The beads were washed several times
with sterile deionized double-distilled water and
resuspended in a 200-mL growth medium for auto-trophic growth under culture room conditions. Freecells were also cultured under similar conditions at thesame time.
2.4. Estimation of NO
3
For studying the effect of metals on NO 3/C0uptake,
cultures were incubated in KNO 3(1.5–20.0 mM). A
bubble column reactor was used for NO 3/C0uptake. The
column was aerated at 250–300cc/min with an airbubbler. Beads were placed into a bubble columnreactor in 500mL growth medium for 24h. At thattime, the medium was pumped out and the beadswere washed with 500mL of double-distilled water.
The column reactor was exposed to a NO
3/C0up-
take medium for 30min; 3-mL samples were takenevery 10min and tested for NO
3/C0depletion. NO 3/C0in
the medium was estimated spectrophotometrically byARTICLE IN PRESS
