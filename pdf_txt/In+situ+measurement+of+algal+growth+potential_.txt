Abstract
Cells of the green alga Selenastrum capricornutum were immobilized in alginate beads. The alga was able to grow
inside these beads without being grazed by zooplankton. For P-limited immobilized cells, however, a lower i/,
and initial slope of the Monod growth curve m,1/K were found than for free cells.
To study the feasibility of immobilized algae to estimate algal growth potential in situ in aquatic ecosystems, a
series of experiments were conducted in indoor model ecosystems (microcosms) and in a small stream. The use of
immobilized algae allowed a continuous registration of algal growth potential integrated over periods with natural
fluctuations in the environment. The method of encapsulation of the algae can, however, still be improved. The
alginate matrix is exposed to marked degradation by microorganisms when incubated in polluted streams for a
period longer than two weeks. The applicability of other types of matrices should be tested.
Introduction
Immobilized whole cells entrapped in polymeric matri-
ces have, in the past two decades, been studied exten-
sively for biotechnological applications (Scott, 1987).
While most efforts have been directed toward bacteria
(Kennedy & Cabral, 1983), attention has also been giv-
en to eukaryotic cells, including algae (Brouers et al.,
1989; Smidsr0d & SkjAk-Braek, 1990).
The encapsulation of algal cells in a matrix may
offer certain advantages when carrying out algal assays
compared to batch or continuous cultures with free
cells. Separation of cells and their excreted products is
quick and simple, and handling of the beads with test
algae is easy. During immobilization algal cells main-
tain their respiratory and photosynthetic activities, and
this method prevents them from being washed out or
grazed by herbivores. Immobilized algae can, when
stored at low temperature (4 C) in darkness, grownormally after 3 to more than 12 months after entrap-
ment (Hertzberg & Jensen, 1989).
Practical applications of immobilized algae include
until now removal of nutrients (Chevalier & de la Noiie,
1985) and heavy metals (Wilkinson et al., 1990) from
wastewater, and also production of secondary metabo-
lites for industrial and pharmaceutical purposes. Fur-
ther, some laboratory experiments have been conduct-
ed to test immobilized algae for use in algal toxicity
assays (Bozeman et al., 1989; Van Donk et al., 1992).
Entrapment, storage and handling of algae in algi-
nate beads are also useful in stock culture management
(Tamponnet et al., 1985; Hertzberg & Jensen, 1989).
Recently, laboratory experiments have demonstrated
the feasibility of using immobilized algae to estimate
bioavailable phosphorus released by zooplankton (Van
Donk et al., 1993), since these test algae were not
simultaneously exposed to grazing by zooplankton.
Until now most growth potential measurements302
have been carried out in the laboratory under standard-
ized conditions with nutrient starved test algae incu-
bated in filtrated water samples (e.g. Skulberg, 1964,
1967; Miller et al., 1978). This method and similar
bioassays using the natural phytoplankton population
as test organisms (e.g. L0vstad 1984; Van Donk et al.,
1988) give only an impression of the nutrient condi-
tions at the moment of sampling. Incubation of test
algae in the continuously fluctuating natural environ-
ment (light, temperature, nutrients, toxins) is prefer-
able, because it will give an integrated measurement
over the whole test period. However, continuous in
situ measurements of algal growth potential in natural
waters is not straightforward because the algal cells
will be flushed out in running waters and are removed
continuously by other loss processes (sedimentation,
grazing, parasitism etc.) in lakes and reservoirs.
The aim of the present study was to test the feasi-
bility of using immobilized algae for monitoring in situ
algal growth potential in aquatic ecosystems. A series
of experiments were carried out in batch cultures, in
indoor model ecosystems (microcosms) and in a small
stream.
Methods
Immobilized cells (beads)
An axenic clone culture of the green alga Selenastrum
capricornutum NIVA CHL 1, from the Culture Col-
lection at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research
(Skulberg & Skulberg, 1990), was selected for the
experiments. This clone is probably the most used test
alga today (Forsberg &Claesson, 1981; Nygaard et al.,
1986). Inoculum cultures were incubated in an inorgan-
ic medium Z8 (Skulberg & Skulberg, 1990) diluted to
20% concentration in glass-distilled water. The illumi-
nation was provided by coolwhite fluorescent tubes at
4.2 1019 mol photons m-2s-1(70 aE m-2s-1) oper-
ating on a 14:10 h LD cycle. To measure algal growth
potential, P-limited algal cells were used, because non-
limited test algae are able to use intracellularly stored
phosphorus to perform high growth rates even under
P-limited conditions. To obtain P-limited algae, expo-
nentially growing cells were inoculated into flasks con-
taining a phosphorus-free medium. The cells entered
stationary phase after 5 days. The method used for
preparing beads of immobilized algal cells was based
on the procedure described by Van Donk et al. (1992).The test algae were encapsulated in these spherical
alginate beads (diam. 3 mm), with Sodium alginate
(Sigma No. A-7128) as matrix for the beads. The mean
initial cell density was 25,000 ± 1150 (SE) cells/bead.
To determine the actual cell number per bead, each
bead was dissolved in 5% sodium hexametaphosphate
and the algal cells were counted with a Coulter Multi-
sizer after 15 min.
Growth experiments in batch cultures with free and
immobilized cells
Short-term laboratory experiments with batch cultures
of immobilized or free cells were used to measure the
maximal growth rates. We also studied the relation-
ship between external P concentration and growth rate
to compare with field measurements. Short-term batch
cultures with free algal cells have been successful-
ly used in previous growth kinetic experiments (Van
Donk & Kilham, 1990). When low cell densities are
inoculated in large volumes in short-term experiments,
the algal cultures approximate steady-state growth con-
ditions because the algae cannot affect the nutrient
concentration to any significant degree.
Free cells and beads were inoculated separately into
1 -L flasks containing 500 mL of medium Z8 (Skulberg
& Skulberg, 1990) diluted to 20% concentration in
glass-distilled water with varying concentrations of P
(0.1-50 lg L-1P). The initial free cell concentration
was ca. 250 cells mL-1.In the experiments with the
immobilized cells, eight beads per flask were inocu-
lated at the start of the experiments. The experiments
were performed at 10 and 20 C because incubations
in the field studies were performed at approximate-
ly these temperatures. Illumination was provided by
cool-white fluorescent tubes at 4.2. 1019 mol photons
m-2s-' operating on a 14:10 h LD cycle at 20 °C and
10:14 h LD at 10 C. The low cell density and large
volume of medium allowed experiments to proceed
for 3 days without the internal concentration becom-
ing measurably reduced. The experiments were carried
out in triplicate. Samples for algal counts of free cells
(5 mL suspension) and immobilized cells (2 beads per
day) were taken daily. Samples of free cells were pre-
served with Lugol's solution and counted microscop-
ically. Finally, least-squares regressions of In (cells
mL-t) vs. time (d) were calculated. Because mea-
surements from replicate flasks were close compared
to other sources of variation, replicates were pooled.
Mean growth rates with SE of the algal cells were cal-
culated by a least squares linear regression analysis of303
In transformed data with more than one value of y per
value of x (Sokal & Rolhf, 1969). Growth rate val-
ues () and P concentration data (S) were fitted to the
Monod relationship
(11 = (,,, S)/(K, +S))
by an iterative non-linear regression method (Kilham,
1975).
Tests in indoor microcosms
Eight microcosms were constructed in a climate room
(20- 1 C). Each microcosm consisted of a glass aquar-
ium (length 110 cm, width 110 cm, height 70 cm), filled
with a 10-cm layer of lake sediment and 50 cm of over-
lying water. Homogenized sediment from a mesotroph-
ic lake (sandy loam), with approximately 3% organic
matter and a nitrogen and phosphorus content of 0.32
and 0.14 mg g-' dry weight, respectively, was used.
Evaporated water was replenished by demineralized
water twice a week. Philips HPI-T 400W high pres-
sure metal halide lamps were used to provide artifi-
cial daylight. The height of the suspended irradiance
assembly were adjusted to get an average intensity of
about 61019 molphotons m-2s-l (100 tE m-2s-1)
at the water surface. A daily photoperiod of 14 h was
maintained. In the preparatory phase of the experiment,
flora and fauna (except fish) characteristic for Dutch
drainage ditches, were introduced. During an acclima-
tion period of 3 months a biocoenosis was allowed to
develop in the microcosms. In this period all eight sys-
tems were interconnected by tubes and the water was
circulated by means of a pump.
The eight microcosms were randomly divided into
two treatment groups (four replicates each). One group
of four microcosms served as controls. The second
group was loaded once with 150 Ag L-1P and 900 g
L-1N (N/P cosms).
Immobilized P-limited algae were incubated in the
microcosms two weeks before and one and two weeks
after the nutrient loading. The beads were put into a
cage consisting of a glass petri-dish (diameter 11.6 cm)
with a cover of stainless steel wire (mesh 0.7 mm).
The cages were placed 5 cm under the water surface.
Samples for algal counts were taken daily (2 beads
every day). Maximum incubation time of the beads
was seven days.
Depth integrated water samples for nutrient and
chlorophyll analysis were taken from each microcosm
by means of Perspex tubes (length 40 cm, diam. 7 cm)
in at least five localities well distributed over each
model ecosystem. In the first week after nutrient load-ing samples were taken every day and in the fol-
lowing weeks only once a week. The samples were
then pooled and ammonium, nitrate/nitrite and soluble
molybdate reactive phosphorus (SRP) were analyzed
using a Skalar 5100 autoanalyser. Chlorophyll-a was
measured according to the ethanol extraction method
described by Moed & Hallegraeff (1978).
Tests in a small stream
The experiments were carried out at four stations in a
small stream, 0sternbekken, near Oslo, Norway. Sta-
tion I was situated in an 'upstream' unpolluted forestry
environment. The catchments between stations I and
II were dominated by agriculture, whereas between st.
II, III and IV resort areas with possibility of sewage
leaks were found.
The algal beads were exposed to the running water
in the stream by means of flow-through exposure cham-
bers located at the four experimental stations (Fig. 1).
A subflow of water from the stream was lead through
the chambers via an open rain drain (U-formed crossec-
tion, diam. 10 cm). An overflow weir removed surplus
water resulting in a constant flow and water level in
the exposure chambers, regardless of discharge in the
stream. Alginate beads with P-limited S. capricornu-
tum were incubated in clear acrylic tubes (diam. 2.5 cm,
length 13 cm), closed in both ends with 1 mm mesh
gauze. The tubes were placed in the chambers, allow-
ing a low, but steady flow of stream water to pass the
beads. Simultaneously, beads were incubated in com-
plete medium in Corning 600 mL acrylic tissue culture
flasks also placed in the same chambers (Fig. 1). A
constant water level of 1 cm above the tubes and the
flasks allowed similar light exposure of the beads in
both test systems. Over a period of two weeks (18-
30 Sep. 1991) six beads from both the tubes and the
flasks were sampled at all stations every second day.
The remaining beads were washed in stream water to
remove particles from the surface to avoid light reduc-
tion to the embedded algae, before continued exposure
in the chamber.
Also water samples from the stream (five times at
each station) were taken for N and P analysis. Unfortu-
nately, integrated water samples for nutrient analyses
were not available to compare nutrient concentrations
with growth rates of the test algae in the streams.
SRP and dissolved inorganic N were measured on
membrane-filtered (0.45 m) samples. P was analyzed
with the molybdate-blue method while NO3/NO2 was
determined after reduction with cadmium, diazotation304

concentrations were negligible during the test period.
Results
Growth experiments (immobilized cells andfree cells)
The Monod constants (,m and K3) of P-limited immo-
bilized cells and free cells, determined in the batch
growth experiments, are given in Table 1. The max-
imum growth rate of the immobilized algae and free
cells were significantly lower at 10 C than at 20 C,
20% and 40% respectively of the values measured at
20 °C. For the P-limited immobilized cells a lower it,
and initial slope of the Monod growth curve (Im/Ks)
were found than for the free cells. Further, a lower
initial slope was measured at 10 C than at 20 C for
both types of cultures.Experiments in indoor microcosms
The mean concentrations of inorganic N and P during
the incubation periods of the immobilized algae in the
microcosms are given in Table 2. The highest concen-
trations were measured in the N/P cosms during the
first week after the nutrient loading (week 1), however
this resulted only in short-term increases in the con-
centrations of inorganic N and P in the water column
(Fig. 2). Especially P decreased rapidly due to absorp-
tion to sediment and uptake by macrophytes. One day
after nutrient additions, concentrations of inorganic N
and P were reduced by more than 50% and after one
week the values were close to the detection levels.
Nutrient addition, however, did not result in
a significant increase in planktonic algal cells or
chlorophyll-a concentrations in the cosms; mean
chlorophyll-a remained below 13 g L- .The growth
rates of encapsulated S. capricornutum cells in the con-

the 14 days sampling period. At the downstream sta-
tions the water quality was markedly affected by nutri-
ent pollution giving concentrations of total P>29 g
L-and total N>1490 tg L-l(Table 3). The dis-
solved fractions of P and N at stations II, III and IV all
exceeded expected growth limiting values for the test
algae.
All growth rates were calculated from day three
onwards, due to a lag phase in growth response of the
test algae. The growth rates of the immobilized algae
incubated in complete medium were similar (p<0.05)
(Fig. 4). The growth rates of the algae incubated in
stream water were significantly lower (p<0.05) than in
complete medium at stations I, II and III, but the rate
was not significantly lower at station IV. The lowest
growth potential was measured at station I (41% of the
complete medium). At stations II, III and IV the growth
rates were 67%, 57% and 62% of the rates in complete
medium, respectively. Because light and temperature
conditions were the same for the test algae incubated in
complete medium and in stream water, the growth rate
of the algae in stream water must be limited or inhibit-
ed by other factors. For station I phosphorus limitation
is the most likely factor. According to the batch cul-
ture experiments at 10 C in the laboratory (Table 1),
immobilized Selenastrum may reach a growth rate of
0.049 d-lat 0.6 g SRP L-1.This is only slightly
higher than the rate measured in the stream at station I
(0.038 d-1at 8.5 C). This may be due to the dif-
ferences in temperature and light conditions between
the batch cultures and the stream (nm is 0.14 d-l at
10 C in batch culture, Table 1: / measured in com-
plete medium is 0.088 d-1 at 8.5 C in the stream,
Fig. 4) or to slightly lower mean P-concentrations in the
stream water during the incubation period than show-
ing by the intermittent water samples. At the other
stations the measured P- and N-concentrations were
higher (Table 3), hence, other factors must have been
responsible for the slightly lower growth potential in
the stream than in the complete medium.
Discussion
Fluctuations in nutrient loading were measured in all
three test systems (batch cultures, microcosms, stream)
by changes in growth rate of the immobilized algae.
In theindoor microcosms addition of N and P only
resulted in short-term increases in the concentrations
of inorganic N and P in the water column. Application
of immobilized algae in these systems made detec-4

tion of intermittent nutrient loading possible, while
chlorophyll-a concentrations in the cosms did not
change. Probably grazing by zooplankton on the free
algal cells in the cosms was responsible for the con-
stant low chlorophyll concentration. Such pulses of
nutrients to aquatic ecosystems may be realistic after
heavy rainfall due to sewerage overflow and washout
from arable land or due to daily changes from domes-
tic sources. Encapsulation of algae seems suitable for
the elimination of grazing (Van Donk et al., 1993) and
make measurement of the gross growth potential of the
algae possible. Incubation of immobilized algae in the
stream allowed detection of different nutrient levels at
upstream and downstream locations.
Dialysis techniques with test algae have been used
(e.g. Jensen etal., 1972; Laake, 1978) to monitor in situ
nutrient loading to aquatic ecosystems. Both dialysis
bags and immobilized algae give an integrated mea-
surement over the whole test period, in contrast to the
widely used point measurements of algal growth poten-
tial tests (AGP-tests). The use of dialysis techniques to
measure phytoplankton growth potential in situ may,
however, be hampered by diffusion limited growth,
sedimentation of algae in the dialysis bags and growth
of algae and bacteria on the membranes. Advantages
of immobilized algae compared to dialysis bags are:
(1) easy handling of the beads, (2) good statistical treat-
ment, (3) no sedimentation of the algae, (4) no growth
of algae on membranes, (5) immobilized algae can be
stored at low temperature in darkness for more than
12 months after entrapment. Both immobilized algae
and dialysis bags, however, have the disadvantage of
restricted nutrient diffusion (Jensen et al., 1972; Van
Donk et al., 1993). Nutrients must diffuse through the307

alginate pores or the dialysis membrane to reach the
algal cells. The difference in initial slope of the Mon-
od growth curve of the free cells and the immobilized
cells was probably due to physical restrictions for algal
multiplication inside the alginate matrix (Hertzberg &
Jensen, 1989). If algae are allowed to grow to high
densities in the beads, resistance to diffusion of P into
the beads is also possible as the diffusion rate through
the alginate pores may restrict nutrition of the inner
algal cells in the beads (Kennedy & Cabral, 1983).
As the beads used had a small diameter (3 mm) and
included only a low concentration of algal cells, diffu-
sion limited growth of the algal cells in the beads may
be minor.
The method of encapsulation of the algae can still
be developed further and improved. Different species
of algae with different physiological characteristics
may be encapsulated in tests beads for evaluation
of environmental conditions. Also biotesting in the
marine environment may be feasible. Our experiments
demonstrated that the alginate matrix is exposed to
degradation by microorganisms when incubated in pol-
luted streams for a period longer than two weeks.
Application of other types of alginates may result in a
higher stability and permeability of the matrix (Mar-
tinsen et al., 1989).
