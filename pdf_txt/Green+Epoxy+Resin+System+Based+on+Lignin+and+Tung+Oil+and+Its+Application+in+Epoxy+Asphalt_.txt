Conclusions
Lignin can be partially depolymerized to yield low MW oligomers by 
hydrogenolysis under the catalysis of Raney Ni in alkaline solution of mixed 
dioxane /H2O solvent or base catalyzed depolymerization in methanol 
under moderate temperature and pressure.
The resulting PDL can be effectively turned into epoxy monomer by 
reacting with epicholorhydrin .
Addition ofepoxy resin hasimproved thehigh temperature performance
and viscoelasticity oftheasphalt binder . 
The properties ofepoxy asphalt increased with theincreasing oftheepoxy
resin contents.
By varying the epoxy resin content, rheological properties of the modified
asphalt can be greatly regulated .Acknowledgements
