 Abstract  32 
Polyphasic taxonomic analysis was performed on a novel bacterium, designated UR159T, isolated in 33 
2016 from human blood of a septic patient hospitalized in France. Preliminary 16S rRNA gene 34 
sequence -based phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain UR159T belonged to the family 35 
Flavobacteriaceae , forming a distinct phyletic line distantly r elated (<94% sequence similarity) to 36 
known species of the family. Further phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genomic analyses were 37 
performed. Cells were non -motile, oxidase -negative, catalase -positive Gram -negative rod. It was 38 
strictly aerobic yielding yellow -pigmented colonies, and was metabolically rather inert. Major fatty 39 
acids were iso -branched fatty acids, predominantly iso -C15:0 (55.5%) and iso -C17:1ω9c (8.8%). Whole 40 
genome sequencing revealed a 2.3 -Mbp genome encoding a total of 2,262 putative genes with a 41 
genomic DNA G+C content at 37.6 mol%. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA -DNA 42 
hybridization (isDDH) values between strain UR159T and the most closely related members of the 43 
Flavobacteriaceae  were <75% and <39%, respectively, much below the established cut -offs for ANI 44 
(<95 -96%) and isDDH (<70%) for species and genus delineation. Average Amino Acid Identity (AAI) 45 
percentages were also estimated and were lower than 65% (cut- off proposed for genus delineation 46 
for uncultivated prokaryotes) in all cases, except for F. marinum  that was just at the limit (65.1%). 47 
Based on these findings, we propose it as a new genus and species, Avrilella dinanensis  gen. nov., sp. 48 
nov. (type strain UR159T = CIP 111616T = DSM 105483T). 49

 Introduction   50 
The Flavo bacteriaceae  family, belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes, was described in 1992 51 
[1]. Since this date, it has much evolved with many new taxa allocated and currently 153 52 
genera with a validly published and correct name are part of the Flavobacteriaceae  family 53 
(www.bacterio.net). Members of this family are Gram- negative non -spore -forming rods 54 
widely described from diverse environmental habitats, especially in the marine environment 55 
[2]. Many species are pathogenic to animals, especially flavobacterial infections in fish [3]. 56 
Even though very rarely isolated in humans, some species are considered as opportunistic 57 
pathogens, especially in immunocompromised patients and those with severe underlying 58 
comorbidities (e.g., cancer, diabetes mellitus and chronic hematological, hepatic or kidney 59 
disorders) [4]. Besides Capnocytophaga spp., the most frequently found species isolated 60 
from clinical materials belong to the following genera: Bergeyella  (B. zoohelcum ), 61 
Chryseobacterium  (C. indologenes ), Elizabethkingia ( E. menigoseptica), Myroides  (M. 62 
odoratus , M. odoratimimus ), Sphingobacterium  (S. multivorum , S. spitivorum ) and Weeksella  63 
(W. virosa ) [5]. Most case reports report these organisms from blood, urine, wounds and 64 
respiratory secretions [4,5].  65 
In the present study, we characterized a new isolate (designated UR159T) and determined its 66 
taxonomic position using a detailed phenotypic and genotypic analysis (polyphasic approach) 67 
[6-8]. Our data suggest that this strain was not related to any previous taxon and thus, we 68 
propose it as a new genus and species, Avrilella dinanensis gen. nov., sp. nov., within the 69 
Flavobacteriaceae  family.  70 
Patient  71 
An unknown Gram -negative rod was isolated in 2016 from two different aerobic blood 72 
culture  bottles in a 93 -year -old female patient hospitalized in the hospital of Dinan (Brittany, 73 
Accepted Manuscript5 
 France). The patient suffered from a sepsis (with a temperature at 39°C) after a red blood 74 
cell transfusion for chronic anemia (Hb <8 g/dl) in the context of a myelod ysplastic 75 
syndrome. Although the association between infection and transfusion was not clearly 76 
proven, the patient was empirically treated by amoxicillin -clavulanate (1 g tid, 10 days) and 77 
became afebrile after 2 days of antimicrobial therapy.  78

Strain isolation  80 
Strain UR159T was recovered from blood cultures (Bactec™ Plus/aerobic bottles; Becton 81 
Dickinson) of the patient. Positive bottles were used for Gram staining and inoculation onto 82 
blood and chocolate agar plates incubated at 35°C aerobically and in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere, 83 
respectively. Strain UR159T was routinely cultivated aerobically at 35°C on blood agar (BA; 84 
ThermoFisher) and preserved for long term at -80°C as a suspension in brain -heart infusion 85 
(BHI; BD Difco™) supplemented wit h 20% glycerol (v/v).  86 
Cell morphology and growth conditions  87 
Cell morphology was observed using both light microscopy and transmission electron 88 
microscopy (TEM). For light microscopy, Gram staining was performed using cells grown on 89 
BA at 35°C for 24 hours.  For TEM, bacterial cells from an exponential culture were collected 90 
after an overnight incubation, transferred to Eppendorf tubes and washed three times in 91 
cacodilate buffer (0.15 M, pH 7.4). Fractions of bacterial suspension were fixed at 4 °C for 60 92 
min with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 M cacodilate buffer to be washed three times in the 93 
same buffer. Cells were post -fixed in 1% OsO 4 for 60 min at 4 °C, rinsed in cacodilate buffer 94 
and embedded in 2% OmniPur® agarose, low melting (Calbiochem, Merck). After th e 95 
dehydration series in acetone, the cells samples were embedded in conventional Epon (EMS, 96 
1420) and then polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. Resins blocks were sectioned into 80 -nm 97 
sections using ultramicrotome LEICA UC7 (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). These sections were 98 
mounted on copper grids and stained. Grids were observed using a JEM- 1400 Electron 99 
Microscope (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV and equipped with 100 
an Orious®  SC1000 camera (Gatan -Ametek, Pleasanton, USA). The cell size measurements 101 
Accepted Manuscript7 
 were carried out by TEM on two batches of culture and on 50 different bacterial cells for 102 
each culture.  103 
Morphology, size and pigmentation of colonies were observed under optimal growth 104 
conditions on BA after 24 hours of incubation at 35°C unde r ambient air. Ability to grow 105 
under aerobic, microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions was assessed after 24 -hour, 48 - 106 
hour and 5 -day incubation at 35°C while CO 2 requirement was tested in an incubator 107 
supplied with 5% CO 2. Note that microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions were obtained 108 
using the Anoxomat Anaerobic Cultivation System (Mart Microbiology, Drachten, The 109 
Netherlands). The growth ability was examined on blood agar plates incubated at 15, 30, 37 110 
and 42°C. Gliding motility was tested as previously  described [6].  111 
Biochemical and antimicrobial susceptibility testing  112 
Identification was attempted by using the MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry (Microflex™ LT/SH 113 
60 Hz; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions for 114 
routine. Oxi dase activity was determined with the MASTDISCS® ID Oxidase Discs (Mast 115 
Diagnostics) and catalase was detected using a 3% (v/v) aqueous H 2O2 solution. Enzyme and 116 
carbon use profiles were generated with the API 20E and Vitek2 GN card microtest systems 117 
(bioM érieux) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  118 
The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the isolate was assessed by determining minimum 119 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) using a commercial assay (Sensititre Gram- negative MIC 120 
plate, Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The following antibiotics 121 
were tested: amoxicillin -clavulanate , piperacillin -tazobactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, 122 
cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, 123 
fosfomycin, tigecycline and colistin.  124 
Chemotaxonomic analysis  125 
Accepted Manuscript8 
 The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis was performed at the Belgian Coordinated 126 
Collections of Microorganisms/Laboratory for Microbiology of the Faculty of Sciences of the 127 
Ghent University (BCCM/LMG), Gent, Belgium. In brief, cells were grown for 24 hours at 35°C 128 
under aerobic conditions on LMG medium 304. Inoculation and harvesting of the cells, and 129 
the extraction and analysis conformed to the recommendations of the commercial MIDI 130 
microbial identification system (Microbial IDentification Inc.). The whole -cell fatty acid 131 
composition was determined by gas chromatography on an Agilent Technologies 6890N gas 132 
chromatograph. The peak naming table MIDI TSBA 5.0 was used.  133 
DNA extraction and 16S rRNA phylogenet ic analysis 134 
DNA was isolated from UR159T using the using the Quick -DNA fungal/bacterial miniprep kit 135 
(Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The 16S 136 
rRNA gene of UR159T was amplified by PCR and sequenced using the unive rsal primers 27F 137 
and 1541R, corresponding to base positions 8 -27 and 1541- 1525 of the 16S rRNA gene of 138 
Escherichia coli, respectively [9]. Both LeBibi -QBPP and NCBI nucleotide collection (nr/nt) 139 
databases were used to identify the nearest neighbor taxa with validly published names 140 
[10,11]. A sequence alignment using 16S rRNA gene sequences was constructed with the 141 
MUSCLE software [12]. All sequences with less than 95% coverage were eliminated, resulting 142 
in a final dataset of 139 sequences (consensus sequenc e = 1,255 bp). The phylogenetic tree 143 
was constructed using MEGA X version 10.7.1 with neighbor -joining (NJ) and maximum- 144 
likelihood (ML) methods [13]. Branch positions were statically tested with a bootstrap of 145 
1,000 replicates.  146 
Genome sequencing, assembly and annotation  147 
After mechanical DNA shearing (Covaris® ultrasonicator), the DNA libraries were prepared 148 
using the NEBNext® Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (New England Biolabs) and 149 
Accepted Manuscript9 
 sequenced as paired- end reads (2 x 300 bp) using the Illumina MiS eq platform and MiSeq 150 
reagent kit v3.  151 
The Illumina reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.32 [14], quality filtered with the 152 
Fastx -toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) and assembled using SPAdes v3.14.0 153 
that includes plasmidSPAdes [15,16]. Note that contigs <1,000 bp were discarded from the 154 
assembly and chromosomal contigs were then scaffolded using the SIS [17] and GapFiller 155 
v1.10 [18] softwares with Flavobacterium marinum  CGMCC 1.10825T (GenBank accession 156 
number NZ_FNXE00000000.1) as the r eference genome sequence.  157 
Genome annotation was performed by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline 158 
(PGAP) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/) . For mobile genetic elements, 159 
prophages were predicted using PHAST [19] completed by the Acti nobacteriophage 160 
database (https://phagesdb.org) and plasmids were searched using the online plasmid 161 
search tool ( https://plasmid.med.harvard.edu/PLASMID/ ). Functional analysis was 162 
performed using RPS BLAST program on COG database implemented in WebMGA 163 
(http://weizhongli -lab.org/webMGA).  164 
Comparative genomics and phylogenomic analysis  165 
To confirm the status as a new taxon of UR159T, Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), in silico 166 
DNA -DNA hybridization (isDDH ), Average Amino Acid Identity (AAI) values were determined. 167 
The calculation of the ANI between strain UR159T and 343 genomes of Flavobacteriaceae - 168 
related species was performed using BLASTN and Pyani v0.2.10 module 169 
(https://pypi.org/project/pyani/ ) [20], following the algorithm described by Goris et al.  [21]. 170 
According to Pyani and 16S rRNA gene similarities, 25 available Flavobacteriaceae genomes 171 
were selected and downloaded from GenBank for comparative genom ic analysis. The 172 
protein coding sequences were predicted for all genomes by using Prokka v1.14.5 [22]. The 173 
Accepted Manuscript10 
 estimation of AAI was determined using the tool AAI calculator ( http://enve - 174 
omics.ce.gatech.edu/ ) [23]. The isDDH values were calculated with the same data set for ANI 175 
calculation using the Genome -to-Genome Distance calculator (GGDC 2.1; 176 
https://ggdc.dsmz.de/) with the formula 2. Pangenomic analysis of the 26 genomes was 177 
conducted using PIRATE software [ 24]. To calculate phylogenomic relations between strain 178 
U159T and phylogenetic neighbours, a core -genome tree was constructed as follows. All 179 
predicted protein- coding genes annotated from each available genome were compared 180 
using the all -versus -all BLAST s earch [25]. Only proteins for which coding sequences with 181 
>50% amino acid identity and >70% sequence coverage were considered as orthologous. The 182 
nucleotide sequences of core gene set were aligned using MUSCLE software and MEGA6 183 
software [26] was used for the phylogenomic tree reconstruction using the neighbour - 184 
joining method with Jukes -Cantor correction.  185 
Sequence accession numbers  186 
The 16S rRNA sequence generated was submitted to GenBank with the accession number 187 
MF278923. The draft genome sequence of UR1 59T was deposited in NCBI under the 188 
accession number NZ_NIPO00000000.  189

 Results and discussion  191 
Strain UR159T was not identified by the MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry using the Bruker 192 
database (version 2.3) but the profile was reproducible (Figure S1). The almo st-complete 193 
sequence of the 16S rRNA gene was obtained (1,516 bp) and used for sequence comparison 194 
and phylogenetic analysis. Strain UR159T exhibited the highest level of nucleotide pairwise 195 
similarity (93.1%) with Flavobacterium marinum  SW105T [27]. Seque nce similarity was lower 196 
with the next closest relatives ( Flavobacterium  spp., Myroides  spp.) with percentages of 16S 197 
rRNA gene sequence similarity in all cases lower than 92.9%. The ML and NJ phylogenetic 198 
trees were almost identical and both confirmed the  affiliation of UR159T to the 199 
Flavobacteriaceae  (Figure 1). The sequence similarity between the 16S rRNA gene of UR159T 200 
and the closest phylogenetic neighbors, which was distinctly below the predetermined cut- 201 
off levels in order to classify bacterial isola tes as novel taxa at the genus (<95%) and (<97 - 202 
98.65%) species levels [7,8,28,29], suggested that the strain was a potentially undescribed 203 
microorganism requiring further characterization.  204 
Phenotypic properties  205 
Strain UR159T grew optimally on BA after 24 -h incubation at 35°C under ambient air, yielding 206 
~1-3-mm, yellow -pigmented, circular, convex, smooth colonies (Figure S2). No growth was 207 
observed when incubated anaerobically and it was demonstrated UR159T was strictly 208 
aerobic (Figure S2). It failed to grow on Drigalski, cetrimide and Hektoen agar (data not 209 
shown). It was a non -motile, oxidase -negative, catalase -positive Gram- negative rod (Figure 210 
2A) able to grow between 15°C and 37°C. TEM confirmed that cells of UR159T were rod - 211 
shaped bacteria measuring an  average size of 0.35 ± 0.02 µm wide and 1.12 ± 0.16 µm long 212 
(Figure 2B). Biochemically, it was metabolically rather inert since almost all reactions were 213 
negative (especially indole production, Voges -Proskaeur, nitrate reduction, H 2S production 214 
Accepted Manuscript12 
 and urease  tests) except of the production of gelatinase, and presented some differences 215 
with species of closely -related genera (Table 1) [27,30 -33]. Furthermore, strain UR159T 216 
appeared susceptible to amoxicillin -clavulanate (MIC <2/2 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (MIC = 0.2 5 217 
mg/L), cotrimoxazole (MIC = 2/38 mg/L) and tigecycline (MIC = 0.5 Mg/L) whereas MICs 218 
were higher for piperacillin -tazobactam (MIC = 8 mg/L), cefotaxime (MIC >4 mg/L), 219 
ceftazidime (MIC = 128 mg/L), cefepime (MIC = 32 mg/L), imipenem (MIC = 4 mg/L), 220 
merope nem (MIC = 8 mg/L), gentamicin (MIC >4 mg/L), amikacin (MIC >16 mg/L), 221 
fosfomycin (MIC >64 mg/L) and colistin (MIC >8 mg/L).  222 
The cellular fatty acids of strain UR159T mainly comprised iso -branched fatty acids, 223 
predominantly iso -C15:0 (55.5%), iso-C 17:1ω9c (8.8%) iso -C17:0 3-OH and summed feature 3 224 
(comprising C 16:1ω9c and/or iso -C15:0 2-OH) (Table 2). Strain UR159T and F. marinum  SW105T 225 
shared similar fatty acid profiles, with minor differences in the respective proportions of the 226 
components (Table 2) [27].  227 
Genomic features   228 
The draft genome size of UR159T was 2,331,799 bp long (3 scaffolds with a final coverage of 229 
124× ) (Table 3 and Figure S3), which is smaller than those of most other members of the 230 
Flavobacteriaceae  family (Table 4). Based on whole genome sequence, the genomic DNA 231 
G+C content was determined at 37.6 mol%, which is consistent with those of the type strains 232 
of closely related genera (31.4 -44.2 mol%) (Tables 3 and 4). The genome encoded a total of 233 
2,262 putative genes, including 2,176 protein -coding genes and 61 RNAs (50 tRNAs, 7 rRNAs 234 
and 4 ncRNAs) and 25 pseudogenes (Table 3). A total of 1,645 genes (75.5%) were assigned 235 
to a COG functional category with 1406 genes (64.5% of the total genes) with known 236 
putative function, and 773 genes were annotated as hypothetical proteins (35.5%) (Table 237 
S1). Whereas no extrachromosomal element was found, a 6.5 -kb prophage -like element was 238 
Accepted Manuscript13 
 found (Figure S3), showing sequence homology to the phage RAP44 of Riemerella  239 
anatipestifer  [34].  240 
Comparative genomic an alysis 241 
Phylogenomic analysis revealed a lack of relatives at the species or genus level, with ANI 242 
values between strain UR159T and the most closely related members of the 243 
Flavobacteriaceae  between 69.7 and 74.0% (alignment coverage from 7.0% to 29.0%) whil e 244 
those of isDDH ranged from 17.9 to 38.7% (Table 4 and Figures S4). These calculated 245 
similarity values were below the proposed and generally accepted species boundaries for 246 
ANI and isDDH that are 95 -96% and 70%, respectively [8,35]. These results indicate  that 247 
strain UR159T constitutes a novel taxon at least at the species level, not related at this level 248 
to any of the closest phylogenetic neighbors, which can be visualized with the core -genome 249 
tree (Figure 3). Additionally, species that share less than 80 % ANI are too divergent to be 250 
compared only based on this parameter, and AAI, which provides a more robust resolution, 251 
should be used instead. Thus, AAI percentages were also estimated with a threshold AAI 252 
value of 65%, which has been proposed for genus de lineation for uncultivated prokaryotes 253 
[29]. AAI values for strain UR159T and the most closely related species were in all cases 254 
lower than 65% (Table 4), except for F. marinum  that is just at the limit (65.1%) (Table 4 and 255 
Figure S5). By pangenomic analys is, only 472 orthologous genes (20.8%) were determined to 256 
be encoded in all genomes whereas 514 genes (22.7%) were predicted to be unique to strain 257 
UR159T compared to other genomes tested. The complete genome of UR159T shared 258 
between 761 (35.5%) to 1403 (65.4%) common gene families with  Weeksella virosa  and F. 259 
marinum  genomes, respectively (Table 4).  260 
In conclusion, taking into account all the findings from phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, 261 
phylogenetic, and genomic analysis, strain UR159T cannot be allocated to any genus and 262 
Accepted Manuscript14 
 species previously described. Hence, this strain represents a novel taxon within the 263 
Flavobacteriacae  family, for which the name Avrilella dinanensis gen. nov., sp. nov. is 264 
proposed. The descriptions of the Avrilella  gen. nov. and Avrilella dinanensis  sp. nov. are 265 
given in Table 5.  266

Description of the new taxon and diagnostic 
traits  Gram -negative, aerobic rods that grow as yellow -
pigmented, circular, convex, smooth colonies. 
Strains are positive for catalase and oxidase, and metaboli cally rather inert except for a gelatinase 
activity. Major fatty acids are iso- branched fatty  
acids, predominantly iso -C15:0, iso -C17:1
ω9c and 
iso-C17:0 3- OH. The genus is affiliated to the family 
‘Flavobacteriaceae’ , order ‘Flavobacteriales’, class 
‘Flav obacteriia’.  Non -motile, oxidase -negative, catalase -positive Gram -negative 
rod able to grow between 15°C and 37°C. Strictly aerobic growing optimally on blood agar after 24 -h incubation at 35°C 
under ambient air, yielding ~1 -3-mm, yellow -pigmented, circula r, 
convex, smooth colonies. Metabolically rather inert, except the 
production of gelatinase. Susceptibility to amoxicillin -clavulanate 
(MIC, 0.5 mg/L), cefoxitin (MIC, 1.5 mg/L), ertapenem (MIC, 1.5 
mg/L) imipenem (MIC, 2 mg/L), meropenem (MIC, 2 mg/L), 
ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.19 mg/L), cotrimoxazole (MIC 0.094 mg/L) 
and tigecycline (MIC, 0.5 Mg/L) but resistant to cefotaxime (MIC 
>32 mg/L), ceftazidime (MIC >32 mg/L), cefepime (MIC, 16 mg/L), aminoglycosides (MICs >16 mg/L), fosfomycin (MIC >64 
mg/L) and col istin (MIC >8 mg/L).
