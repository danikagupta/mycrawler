The Shikimate Pathway: Early Steps in the Biosynthesis of 
Aromatic Compounds

INTRODUCTION 
The shikimate pathway was discovered as the biosynthetic 
route to the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and 
tryptophan through the classic studies of Bernhard Davis and 
David Sprinson and their collaborators. This pathway has been 
found only in microorganisms and plants. Phenylalanine and 
tryptophan are essential components of animal diets, and 
animals synthesize tyrosine in a single step from phenylala- 
nine. Thus, with respect to plant specificity, the shikimate 
pathway is a bit more widespread than nitrogen fixation or pho- 
tosynthesis but less ubiquitous than, for example, nitrogen 
assi milat ion . 
Bacteria spend >90% of their total metabolic energy on pro- 
tein biosynthesis. Consequently, the bacterial shikimate 
pathway serves almost exclusively to synthesize the aromatic 
amino acids (Herrmann, 1983; Pittard, 1987). In contrast, higher 
plants use these amino acids not only as protein building blocks 
but also, and in even greater quantities, as precursors for a 
large number of secondary metabolites, among them plant 
pigments, compounds to defend against insects and other her- 
bivores (see Dixon and Paiva, 1995, this issue), UV light 
protectants, and, most importantly, lignin (Bentley, 1990; Singh 
et al., 1991; see Whetten and Sederoff, 1995, this issue). Under 
normal growth conditions, 20% of the carbon fixed by plants 
flows through the shikimate pathway (Haslam, 1993). Globally, 
this amounts to ~7 x 1015 kg each year, most of it used for 
the synthesis of the various secondary metabolites. And the 
variation in shikimate pathway-derived secondary metabolites 
is very extensive among plant species. The secondary metabo- 
lite makeup of a plant could be used for species classification. 
Different plants not only synthesize different aromatic sec- 
ondary metabolites but also synthesize varying amounts of 
them at specific times and in specific subcellular compart- 
ments. One would expect that regulation of the differential 
biosynthesis of sometimes very complex molecular structures 
might involve regulation of the supply of the precursors influenc- 
ing the rate-limiting step for carbon flow through the shikimate 
pathway. Recent data on transgenic potatoes give some indi- 
cation that this is indeed the case (Jones et al., 1995). 
This review gives a short overview of the shikimate path- 
way and briefly introduces the seven enzymes that catalyze 
the sequential steps of the pathway. This is followed by a dis- 
cussion of some enzymes of quinate metabolism, which use shikimate pathway intermediates as substrates, thus forming 
branches off the main trunk. I end by discussing some regula- 
tory features of severa1 of the enzymes. 
THE SHlKlMATE PATHWAY 
The biosynthesis of the three aromatic amino acids is best con- 
sidered in two parts: the shikimate pathway from phosphoenol 
pyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate to chorismate, which is 
common to phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosyn- 
thesis, and the three specific terminal pathways that use 
chorismate as a substrate. Because all three aromatic amino 
acids found in proteins are synthesized via the shikimate path- 
way, it has often been referred to as the common aromatic 
biosynthetic pathway (Herrmann, 1983). Bentley (1990) con- 
siders this notation incorrect because not all aromatic natural 
products originate with this metabolic sequence. 
Figure 1 outlines the seven steps of the shikimate pathway. In 
the first step, the glycolytic intermediate phosphoenol pyruvate 
and the pentose phosphate pathway intermediate erythrose- 
4-phosphate are condensed to a seven-carbon six-membered 
heterocyclic compound, 3-deoxy-o-arabino-heptulosonate 
Fphosphate (DAHP), which can formally be considered a 
2-deoxy-~-glucose-6-phosphate derivative (Garner and 
Herrmann, 1984). In the second step, the ring oxygen is 
exchanged for the exocyclic C7 of DAHP to form a highly 
substituted cyclohexane derivative, 3-dehydroquinate. The re- 
maining five steps serve to introduce a side chain and two of 
the three double bonds that convert this cyclohexane into the 
benzene ring, the hallmark of aromatic compounds. Figure 
2 shows chorismate, the final product of the main trunk of the 
shikimate pathway, as a substrate for a number of anabolic 
sequences to primary and secondary compounds. 
Figure 1 indicates the names of the seven enzymes of the 
shikimate pathway and the notation I propose for the plant 
genes encoding these enzymes. This gene notation is different 
from the bacterial aro mnemonic nomenclature. In response 
to the concerns mentioned by Bentley (1990), shk has been 
chosen to avoid potential conflicts with genes encoding en- 
zymes of nonchorismate-derived aromatic biosynthesis. The 908 The Plant Cell

The abbreviations shkA through shkH are the notations proposed for the wild-type genes encoding aikimate pathway enzymes in higher plants. 
designations shkA and shkB have been reserved for genes 
encoding isoenzymes that catalyze the first step, because these 
fall into two distinct families (Gorlach et al., 1993a; Herrmann, 
1995). 
DAHP Synthase 
The first committed step in the biosynthesis of the three aro- 
matic amino acids is catalyzed by DAHP synthase. This enzyme 
has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from sev- 
era1 microbial sources, and pure preparations of the carrot 
(Suzich et al., 1985) and potato (Pinto et al., 1986) enzymes 
have been prepared. The plant DAHP synthases are homodi- 
meric enzymes activated by Mn*+ and tryptophan. Their subunit molecular weights of 53,000 to 55,000 are much larger 
than the corresponding values of the microbial homologs 
(Herrmann, 1995). Mns and tryptophan are ligands that stabi- 
lize the quaternary structure of the enzymes in a hysteretic 
fashion. The Km values for phosphoenol pyruvate and eryth- 
rose-4-phosphate are 30 and 70 pM, respectively, similar to 
the values obtained for DAHP synthases from microorganisms. 
In contrast to the microbial enzymes, none of the plant DAHP 
synthases is inhibited by any of the three aromatic amino acids. 
Escherichia coli, for instance, has three DAHP synthase isoen- 
zymes: one feedback inhibited by phenylalanine, one by 
tyrosine, and one by tryptophan. These isoenzymes, which 
are the products of three different genes, all require a metal 
ion for enzyme activity (McCandliss and Herrmann, 1978; 
Baasov and Knowles, 1989; Stephens and Bauerle, 1991) and The Shikimate Pathway 909 
can be assayed independently because of their strict sensi- 
tivity to the individual amino acid (Herrmann, 1983). The 
number of isoenzymes and their sensitivities to the three aro- 
matic amino acids vary from microbe to microbe and have been 
used to define taxa (Jensen, 1970; Ahmad et al., 1986). 
The lack of feedback inhibition has made it difficult to dis- 
tinguish between the plant isoenzymes. Early studies 
distinguished, on the basis of metal activation, a Mn2+-depen- 
dent and a Co2+-activated DAHP synthase (Rubin et al., 1982; 
Ganson et al., 1986). Severa1 forms of the Mn2+-stimulated en- 
zyme have been separated by ion exchange chromatography 
and by chromatofocusing (Suzich et al., 1985; Pintoet al., 1986). 
These forms may be isoenzymes, because cloning efforts in 
severa1 laboratories have identified two families of genes

Metabolites. 
The arrows indicate pathways and not necessarily single reactions. 
For example, conversion of chorismate to tryptophan requires five en- 
zymes (see Radwanski and Last, 1995, this issue). encoding Mnz+-stimulated DAHP synthases, the shkA and 
shkB types. The shkA-type enzymes from different species 
resemble each other more than do the shkA and shkB enzymes 
from a single plant (Keith et al., 1991; Gorlach et al., 1993a; 
Herrmann, 1995). The greater evolutionary distance between 
shkA and shkB suggests that DAHP synthase isoenzymes 
existed before genera such as Solanum and Lycopersicon 
diverged. 
Recent studies of the Co2+-activated enzyme have shown 
a broad substrate specificity with respect to the aldehydic sub- 
strate, and the Co*+-activated enzyme has been found to have 
a K, for erythrose4phosphate that is one order of magnitude 
higher than that of the Mn2+-stimulated activity (Doong et al., 
1992). Thus, the ability of the Co2+-activated enzyme to sup- 
ply DAHP for aromatic biosynthesis has been questioned 
(Gorlach et al., 1993a). A careful molecular biological analy- 
sis and comparison of the amino acid sequences are required 
to determine how closely related this enzyme is to the known 
M n2+-stim u lated DAH P synthases. 
The first cDNA encoding a plant DAHP synthase (Dyer et 
al., 1990) was obtained from potato cells grown in suspension 
culture by screening a cDNA expression library with polyclonal 
antibodies against the potato tuber enzyme (Pinto et al., 1988). 
This potato cDNA was used to clone homologs from Arabidop- 
sis (Keith et al., 1991), tobacco (Wang et al., 1991), and tomato 
(Gorlach et al., 1993a) and a second cDNA from potato (Zhao 
and Herrmann, 1992). The deduced amino acid sequences 
of the plant enzymes show only -20% identity with their 
microbial homologs. However, complementation of yeast (Keith 
et al., 1991) and E. coli (Weaver et al., 1993) mutants devoid 
of DAHP synthase with plasmids carrying the Arabidopsis and 
potato cDNAs, respectively, proved that those cDNAs encode 
polypeptides with DAHP synthase enzyme activity. 
The plant cDNAs encode N termini that resemble transit se- 
quences for chloroplast import (Gavel and von Heijne, 1990). 
Therefore, it seems likely that all of the Mn2+-stimulated DAHP 
synthases reside in plastids. The Co2+-activated DAHP syn- 
thase has been localized to the cytosol by discontinuous 
sucrose gradient centrifugation (Ganson et al., 1986). Because 
of the broad substrate specificity of this DAHP synthase, it re- 
mains a challenge to show, unequivocally, a specific enzyme 
dedicated exclusively to DAHP synthesis outside the plant 
chloroplasts. 
3-Dehydroquinate Synthase 
The second enzyme of the shikimate pathway, 3-dehydroqui- 
nate synthase, requires catalytic amounts of NAD+ and a 
divalent cation for activity. For the bacterial enzyme, Co2+ and 
Zn2+ are the most active metal ions. The E. coli enzyme (Frost 
et al., 1984; Millar and Coggins, 1986) catalyzes a seemingly 
very complex reaction involving an intramolecular oxidation- 
reduction at C5 of DAHP with very tight binding of the NAD+ 
cofactor, the syn elimination of phosphate, and an alicyclic ring 
formation (Bender et al., 1989). However, Widlanski et al. (1989) 910 The Plant Cell 
have speculated that the enzyme may merely catalyze the oxi- 
dation and the reduction, with the other identified steps in the 
overall reaction mechanism proceeding spontaneously. The 
mung bean (Yamamoto, 1980) and pea(Pomplian0 et al., 1989) 
enzymes have been purified, but no cDNA encoding this 
enzyme has yet been isolated from any higher plant. 3-Dehydro- 
quinate synthase is the only plant enzyme of the shikimate 
pathway for which no primary structural data are available. 
3-Dehydroquinate Dehydratase'Shikimate 
De hyd rogenase 
In higher plants, the third and fourth steps of the shikimate 
pathway are catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme (Koshiba, 1978; 
Polley, 1978). In mung bean, the moss Physcomitrella patens, 
spinach, pea, and tobacco, the 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase 
and shikimate dehydrogenase activities reside on a single poly- 
peptide (Fiedler and Schultz, 1985; Mousedale et al., 1987). 
Such bi- or even multifunctional enzymes are found in severa1 
amino acid biosynthetic pathways, but homologous reactions 
are sometimes structurally organized in different ways in differ- 
ent organisms. For example, in Neurospora crassa (Case and 
Giles, 1968), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Nakanishi and 
Yamamoto, 1984), Aspergillus nidulans (Charles et al., 1986), 
and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Duncan et al., 1987), the sec- 
ond through sixth reactions of the shikimate pathway are 
catalyzed by a pentafunctional polypeptide encoded by the 
arom gene. In contrast, in the bacteria E. coli and Salmonella 
typhimurium, the seven enzymes of the shikimate pathway are 
all individual polypeptides. 
Fungi have two 3-dehydroquinate dehydratases with little 
apparent sequence homology (Giles et al., 1985). The type I 
enzyme is heat labile, catalyzes a syn elimination (Hanson and 
Rose, 1963), and has K,,, values in the lower micromolar 
range. The type II enzyme is heat stable, catalyzes a tfans elimi- 
nation (Harris et al., 1993), and has K,,, values one to two 
orders of magnitude higher than those of the type I enzyme. 
In general, the type II enzyme participates in 3-dehydroquinate 
degradation (see later discussion). 
The 3-dehydroquinate dehydratases of most bacteria and 
higher plants are type I enzymes. In the E. coli3-dehydroquin- 
ate dehydratase, a histidine residue (Deka et al., 1992) and 
a lysine residue (Chaudhuri et al., 1991) are in the active site 
of the enzyme. A type I enzyme has beea crystallized from 
S. typhimurium; the crystals refract to 2.3-A resolution (Boys 
et al., 1992). A type II 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (Garbe 
et al., 1991) from Mycobacterium tyberculosis has been crys- 
tallized; the crystals refract to 2.2-A resolution (Gourley et al., 
1994). The analysis of these crystals will yield structures that 
may reveal some fundamental differences in the reaction mech- 
anisms of enzyme-catalyzed syn and anti water elimination. 
Severa1 forms of the bifunctional 3-dehydroquinate de- 
hydratase'shikimate dehydrogenase have been purified to 
electrophoretic homogeneity from the stroma of spinach chlo- 
roplasts (Fiedler and Schultz, 1985). The turnover number of 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase is approximately one-ninth that 
of shikimate dehydrogenase, so dehydroquinate is readily con- 
verted to shikimate without accumulation of dehydroshikimate. 
The leve1 of dehydroshikimate is apparently kept low to pre- 
vent induction of the catabolic pathway to protocatechuate (see 
later discussion). 
Partia1 cDNAs encoding the 3-dehydroquinate dehydra- 
tase'shikimate dehydrogenase of pea (Deka et al., 1994) and 
tobacco (Bonner and Jensen, 1994) have recently been cloned 
using antibodies against the pure bifunctional pea and tobacco 
enzymes. Although neither cDNA is full length, the more ex- 
tensive tobacco sequence includes the entire coding region 
for the mature bifunctional enzyme plus 69 nucleotides up- 
stream of this region. The latter were speculated to encode 
part of a transit peptide for plastid import. This putative transit 
peptide is rich in hydroxylated amino acid residues but has 
a net negative charge, a feature not yet seen for any other chlo- 
roplast transit peptide (Archer and Keegstra, 1990; Gavel and 
von Heijne, 1990). Pairwise sequence alignments of the two 
domains of the bifunctional tobacco dehydratase-dehydro- 
genase with the monofunctional homologs from other organisms 
show that the plant enzymes are evolutionarily closer to their 
prokaryotic than to their lower eukaryotic homologs. Amino 
acid sequence identities vary from 24 to 36%. 
Shikimate Kinase 
In the fifth step of the pathway, a kinase phosphorylates shiki- 
mate to yield shikimate 3-phosphate. Elimination of this 
phosphate two steps later leads to the second double bond 
of the benzene ring. E. coli has two shikimate kinases of simi- 
lar size but with different K,,, values for shikimate: m5 mM for 
enzyme I, and 200 pM for enzyme II (Whipp and Pittard, 1995). 
Enzyme II may be the major activity for chorismate biosynthe- 
sis. The three-dimensional structure of shikimate kinase II was 
predicted by computer modeling based on adenylate kinase 
coordinates (Matsuo and Nishikawa, 1994). The synthesis of 
enzyme II is subject to regulation by the tyr and trp repres- 
sors; enzyme I is synthesized constitutively (Heatwole and 
Somerville, 1992). 
Plant shikimate kinases have been described from pea 
(Mousedale and Coggins, 1985) and rice (Kavi Kishor, 1989), 
and the activity has been purified to near homogeneity from 
spinach chloroplasts (Schmidt et al., 1990). The first plant cDNA 
encoding shikimate kinase was isolated from tomato (Schmid 
et al., 1992) by performing the polymerase chain reaction using 
as primers two oligonucleotides whose sequences are con- 
served between genes for the E. coli (DeFeyter et al., 1986; 
Millar et al., 1986), Erwinia chrysanthemi(Minton et al., 1989), 
and S. cerevisiae (Duncan et al., 1987) enzymes. The deduced 
amino acid sequence of the tomato enzyme contains an N-termi- 
na1 extension that resembles a transit sequence for chloroplast 
import. Indeed, in vitro-synthesized tomato shikimate kinase 
precursor is processed and taken up by isolated spinach chloro- 
plasts (Schmid et al., 1992). DNA gel blots of tomato genomic The Shikimate Pathway 91 1 
DNA are consistent with a single copy gene for shikimate ki- 
nase (Schmid et al., 1992). These data agree with earlier 
observations that spinach contains a single shikimate kinase 
localized exclusively to the chloroplasts (Schmidt et al., 1990). 
EPSP Synthase 
The penultimate step in the shikimate pathway is the revers- 
ible formation of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) 
and inorganic phosphate from shikimate 3-phosphate and 
phosphoenolpyruvate. The reaction is catalyzed by EPSP syn- 
thase, the best studied of all the enzymes in this pathway. This 
enzyme has been purified from both microbial and plant 
sources (Duncan et al., 1984; Mousedale and Coggins, 1984). 
The enzyme-catalyzed reaction mechanism has been probed 
in great detail (Anderson et al., 1990), and arguments have 
been advanced for both ordered (Anderson and Johnson, 1990) 
and random (Gruys et al., 1993) kinetic mechanisms. Site- 
directed mutagenesis and nuclear magnetic resonance studies 
have placed a histidine residue very close to the active site 
of the enzyme (Shuttleworth and Evans, 1994). Thef. colieno- 
zyme was crystallized and the x-ray structure analyzed to 3-A 
resolution (Stallings et al., 1991). This analysisshows that EPSP 
synthase has a two-domain structure, with the active site pre- 
sumably near the interdomain crossover segment. 
EPSP synthase is the unique target for the widely used 
broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate (Steinrücken and 
Amrhein, 1980). Plant enzymes have Ki values for glyphosate 
that are approximately one order of magnitude lower than the 
values for the microbial enzymes. The inhibition is competi- 
tive with phosphoenolpyruvate. This metabolic intermediate 
is a substrate not only for EPSP synthase but also for a num- 
ber of other enzymes of intermediary metabolism, including 
the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway. However, none of 
these other enzymes is inhibited by glyphosate. Glyphosate 
toierance in plants has been obtained by expression of a mu- 
tant allele encoding a less sensitive bacterial enzyme (Stalker 
et al., 1985) or by overproduction of EPSP synthase (Smart 
et al., 1985; Shah et al., 1986; Goldsbrough et al., 1990). 
The high degree of specificity of glyphosate for EPSP syn- 
thase has been explained by the fact that the herbicide binds 
to the protein only in close proximity to shikimate 3-phosphate 
(Christensen and Schaefer, 1993). However, the product of the 
enzyme-catalyzed reaction, EPSP, also facilitates glyphosate 
binding; although the exact spatial orientation between glypho- 
sate and the enzyme in the ternary complexes with shikimate 
3-phosphate or EPSP is unknown, part of glyphosate must 
bind near to but outside the active site (Sammons et al., 1995). 
lsoenzymes of EPSP synthase with similar K,,, and Ki 
values for glyphosate have been separated by HPLC from seed- 
ling extracts of Sorghum bicolor (Ream et al., 1988), and 
molecular biological data are consistent with isoenzymes in 
other plants as well. For example, two forms of the maize en- 
zyme have been purified to homogeneity that differ in thermal stability and regulatory properties but that are both localized 
to plastids (Forlani et al., 1994). 
Plant DNAs encoding EPSP synthase have been isolated 
from petunia (Shah et al., 1986), Arabidopsis (Klee et al., 1987), 
tomato (Gasser et al., 1988), and Brassica napus (Gasser and 
Klee, 1990). All the cDNAs encode precursor proteins with 
N-terminal transit sequences for plastid import. Amino acid 
sequence comparison of the different plant enzymes shows 
-9OO/o identity in the mature proteins. Amino acid sequences 
of the mature plant EPSP synthases are more similar to homo- 
logs from bacteria than to those from fungi. In vitro uptake 
experiments have shown that the petunia transit sequence 
directs import into plastids (Della-Cioppa et al., 1986), and 
immunocytochemistry on suspensioncultured plant cells con- 
firms the plastidic locale of the enzyme in vivo (Smart and 
Amrhein, 1987). Glyphosate inhibits the uptake of the enzyme 
into the plastid; efficient translocation apparently requires the 
unfolding of the polypeptide, a process that may be prevented 
or severely inhibited by the herbicide (Della-Cioppa and 
Kishore, 1988). To what extent this lack of efficient transloca- 
tion contributes to the herbicidal effect of glyphosate is unclear, 
because tight binding of the herbicide to the enzyme requires 
shikimate 3-phosphate or EPSP, metabolic intermediates that 
may reside exclusively in the plastids. 
Chorismate Synthase 
The seventh and last step of the shikimate pathway is the con- 
certed lP-trans elimination of phosphate from EPSP to yield 
chorismate (Balasubramanian et al., 1990; Hawkes et al., 
1990). Chorismate synthase, which catalyzes this reaction, 
requires a reduced flavin nucleotide (FMNHz) as a cofactor, 
even though the overall reaction is redox neutral. The same 
is true of step two of the pathway, which is catalyzed by 
3-dehydroquinate synthase, an enzyme that requires NAD+ 
for catalytic activity. Spectroscopic analysis of cofactor func- 
tion suggested a radical as an intermediate in the reaction 
catalyzed by chorismate synthase (Ramjee et al., 1992). The 
N. crassa (Welch et al., 1974) and fuglena gracilis (Schaller 
et al., 1991b) enzymes are bifunctional; an associated NADPH- 
driven flavin reductase generates the reduced cofactor. 
In contrast to the funga1 enzymes, E. coli(White et al., 1988) 
and higher plant enzymes (Schaller et al., 1990) are monofunc- 
tional and require FMNHz and strictly anaerobic assay 
conditions. As noted by Schaller et al. (1991a), the difference 
between the monofunctional and bifunctional enzymes, that 
is, the potential lack of the flavin reductase domain in the 
monofunctional enzyme, is also reflected in the subunit sizes 
of the oligomeric enzymes. In B. subrilis, the reductase is a 
separate polypeptide that is part of a trifunctional enzyme 
chorismate synthase'3-dehydroquinate synthase*flavin reduc- 
tase (Hasan and Nester, 1978). The two enzymes of the pathway 
that require redox cofactors in overall redox-neutra1 reactions 
are physically associated, even though they do not catalyze 
consecutive steps in this metabolic sequence. 912 The Plant Cell 
Plant chorismate synthase was first demonstrated in pea 
chloroplasts (Mousedale and Coggins, 1986) and purified to 
homogeneity from cells of Corydalis sempefvirens (Schaller 
et al., 1990). The first plant cDNA encoding chorismate syn- 
thase was isolated by expression cloning using a polyclonal 
antibody raised against this enzyme (Schaller et al., 1991a). 
This cDNA and two tomato homologs (G8rlach et al., 1993b) 
encode polypeptides with N-terminal extensions that resem- 
ble transit peptides for chloroplast import. 
QUINATE DEGRADATION 
At least two intermediates of the biosynthetic pathway toward 
chorismate, 3-dehydroquinate and 3-dehydroshikimate, are 
also intermediates in the degradation of quinate. Figure 3 shows 
this metabolite as a precursor of chlorogenate, which accumu- 
lates in severa1 plants (for example, coffee bean), to substantial 
levels. Although the accumulation of quinate appears to be 
restricted to specific plants, the occurrence of chlorogenate 
and its derivatives is more widespread. Chlorogenate is the 
major soluble phenylpropanoid in tobacco and a preformed 
protectant against fungal attack (Maher et al., 1994). It con- 
tributes to general plant health as part of a physical and 
possibly also a chemical barrier against microbial attack. Once 
this barrier is broken, the constituents become potential car- 
bon sources for the attacker. 
During a careful analysis of fungal mutants with lesions in 
the genes encoding biosynthetic shikimate pathway enzymes, 
Giles et al. (1985) detected a catabolic pathway for quinate, 
which, along with shikimate, is readily degraded by fungi and 
some bacteria, first to protocatechuate and ultimately to suc- 
cinate and acetyl-COA. In fact, N. crassa (Giles et al., 1985), 
A. nidulans (Grant et al., 1988), and Rhodococcus rhodochrous 
(Bruce and Cain, 1990) can all use quinate (or shikimate) as 
their only carbon source. 
The first three steps of quinate catabolism are an NAD- 
gependent oxidation to 3-dehydroquinate followed by two 
dehydrations, first to Sdehydroshikimate and then to protocate- 
chuate. The enzymes catalyzing these reactions are quinate 
dehydrogenase, 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, and 3-dehy- 
droshikimate dehydratase, respectively. Their primary 
structures have been deduced from the corresponding gene 
sequences (Giles et al., 1985; Grant et al., 1988). The quinate 
dehydrogenase also oxidizes shikimate to 3-dehydroshikimate. 
This NAD-dependent enzyme activity of a shikimate dehydro- 
genase is different from that of the anabolic NADP-dependent 
isoenzyme. Catabolic and anabolic shikimate dehydrogenases 
are structurally different, even though they share some se- 
quence similarities (Anton and Coggins, 1988). Most but not 
all catabolic quinate dehydrogenases are NAD dependent; one 
exception is quinate dehydrogenase of Acinetobacter calco- 
aceticus, which oxidizes quinate and shikimate to their 
3-dehydro derivatives (Kleef and Duine, 1988) using as a co- 
factor pyrrolo-quinoline quinone (Duine and Jongejan, 1989; 
Elsemore and Ornstrom, 1994). OH XAD

Figure 3. Metabolic lntermediates of the Shikimate Pathway in Quinate 
Synthesis and Degradation. 
The enzymes of the quinate cycle are (1) quinate (shikimate) dehydroge- 
nase; (2) 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase; and (3) quinate hydrolyase. 
SDehydroshikimate is aromatized to protocatechuate by Sdehydroshiki- 
mate dehydratase (4). Bold arrows indicate reactions of the main trunk 
of the shikimate pathway. 
The second enzyme of fungal quinate degradation, the 
3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, is also structurally different from 
the biosynthetic isoenzyme, which is encoded by part of the 
arom cluster described previously. The third enzyme in this 
catabolic sequence, the 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase, 
catalyzes a syn elimination of water to yield protocatechuate 
(Scharf et al., 1971). Thus, fungi have clearly separated path- 
ways for the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids and the The Shikimate Pathway 913 
degradation of quinate, even though 3-dehydroquinate and 
3-dehydroshikimate are metabolic intermediates in both. 
Whereas fungi use quinate as a carbon source for growth, 
in higher plants, quinate is the precursor for chlorogenate and 
may also serve as a storage or transport form of carbon 
(Beaudoin-Eagan and Thorpe, 1984). Quinate could be syn- 
thesized in one step from dehydroquinate by quinate 
dehydrogenase or from shikimate by quinate hydrolyase (Fig- 
ure 3). Plants can also use quinate as a carbon source for 
aromatic amino acids (Leuschner and Schultz, 1991a, 1991b). 
Whether the two enzymes, the dehydrogenase and the 
hydrolyase, serve in both an anabolic and a catabolic capac- 
ity or whether one is used for quinate biosynthesis and the 
other for quinate degradation remains an open question. 
Plant quinate dehydrogenase was discovered in bean cells 
(Gamborg, 1966) and purified to homogeneity from carrot cells 
(Refeno et al., 1982) and mung beans (Kang et al., 1994). The 
bean enzyme is localized to the plastid stroma and can use 
both NAD and NADP as cofactors. 
A quinate hydrolyase has recently been isolated from pea 
roots (Leuschner et al., 1995). This plastid-localized enzyme 
converts quinate directly to shikimate, a reaction envisioned 
more than 100 years ago by the discoverer of shikimate 
(Eykmann, 1891). Together with quinate dehydrogenase and 
dehydroquinate dehydratase, quinate hydrolyase forms what 
is shown in Figure 3 as the quinate cycle. ldentification of these 
three enzymes as anabolic, catabolic, or both remains to be 
made. 
REGULATION OF CARBON FLOW IN THE 
SHlKlMATE PATHWAY 
All enzymes of the shikimate pathway have been obtained in 
pure form, and some of their properties have been described. 
The primary structures are known for six of the seven higher 
plant activities in the main trunk of this metabolic sequence. 
For both plants and bacteria, at least two of the seven enzymes 
can be regulated. Regulatory features have been elucidated 
for DAHP synthase and shikimate kinase. 
Regulation of the shikimate pathway in lower eukaryotes is 
different from that in prokaryotes and involves feedback inhi- 
bition and both transcriptional and translational control (Braus, 
1991). DAHP synthase isoenzymes that are sensitive to spe- 
cific aromatic amino acids are similar to their prokaryotic 
homologs with respect to substrate and inhibitor binding con- 
stants. However, control of shikimate pathway gene expression 
in yeast and fungi is very different from that in prokaryotes. 
In yeast, for example, the transcriptional activator GCN4 con- 
trols initiation of transcription for ~30 genes encoding enzymes 
of several amino acid biosynthetic pathways, including those 
for the aromatic amino acids. Starvation for any one amino 
acid leads to derepression of all the genes. GCN4 affects 
RNA polymerase II activity by binding to DNA recognition 
elements that have been identified in all GCN4-controlled promoters, including those for genes encoding DAHP synthase 
and chorismate synthase. The expression of GCN4 itself is 
under translational control that depends on several other posi- 
tive effectors, including the protein kinase GCN2. 
The prokaryotic DAHP synthase is regulated at two levels. 
Feedback inhibition of enzyme activity and transcriptional con- 
trol of enzyme synthesis are mediated by the three aromatic 
amino acids and affect specific isoenzymes. The genes en- 
coding the tyrosine- and tryptophan-sensitive isoenzymes are 
regulated by the tyr and trp repressors, respectively (Garner 
and Herrmann, 1985; Klig et al., 1988), and the synthesis of the 
tryptophan-sensitive isoenzyme is affected by both repressors 
(Muday et al., 1991). However, feedback inhibition appears to 
be the major regulatory mechanism in vivo (Ogino et al., 1982). 
In contrast with bacterial and lower eukaryote DAHP syn- 
thases, plant DAHP synthases are not subject to feedback 
inhibition by the aromatic amino acids; in fact, both tyrosine 
and tryptophan act as activating ligands of the enzymes from 
carrot and potato by affecting the quaternary structures of these 
catalysts (Suzich et al., 1985; Pinto et al., 1986). The first evi- 
dente of metabolic regulation of a plant DAHP synthase came 
from experiments with suspension-cultured potato cells ex- 
posed to glyphosate (Pinto et al., 1988). In vivo, this herbicide 
reduces chorismate synthesis by inhibiting the penultimate step 
in the pathway (see earlier discussion). In addition, it increases 
both the activity and amount of DAHP synthase. We know this 
increase is specific, because the activity of 3-dehydroquinate 
synthase, the second enzyme in the pathway, is unaffected. 
The herbicide has no effect on DAHP synthase in vitro, how- 
ever, indicating that inhibition of chorismate synthesis results 
in the production of a signal that presumably affects transcrip- 
tion or translation of the gene encoding DAHP synthase. The 
nature of this signal is unknown. 
Stress on intact plants has similar effects on DAHP synthase 
levels. Both mechanical wounding (Dyer et al., 1989) and fun- 
gal elicitation (McCue and Conn, 1989; Keith et al., 1991; 
Gorlach et al., 1995) induce DAHP synthase mRNA accumu- 
lation. Thus, increased carbon flow into the shikimate pathway 
in response to different environmental demands appears to 
be accomplished by derepression of DAHP synthase. This 
derepression is specific for isoenzymes of the shkA type (Keith 
et ai., 1991; J. Zhao, M. Sakuta, L.M. Weaver, and K.M. 
Herrmann, unpublished results). 
When plants are mechanically wounded or challenged by 
microbial or insect attack, much of the increased demand for 
chorismate may be for lignin to repair the lesions. DAHP syn- 
thase apparently plays a major control function in lignin 
biosynthesis, because transgenic plants that express shkA- 
type DAHP synthase antisense RNA are impaired in lignin bio- 
synthesis (Jones et al., 1995). 
Expression of DAHP synthase not only is affected by en- 
vironmental stimuli but also is tissue specific, and mRNA levels 
of all but the first enzyme of the pathway appear to be regu- 
lated in concert (Gorlach et al., 1994). In tomato, similar patterns 
have been found for organ-specific mRNA accumulation of 
shikimate kinase, EPSP synthase, and chorismate synthase. 914 The Plant Cell 
The levels of mRNA encoding DAHP synthase isoenzymes 
differ from each other and from mRNA levels of the other shiki- 
mate pathway enzymes. 
Any consideration of the regulation of a plant pathway should 
include the subcellular locale of the metabolic sequence. Iso- 
lated chloroplasts incorporate 14C02 into aromatic amino 
acids, and enzymes of the shikimate pathway can be assayed 
in preparations of isolated chloroplasts (Bickel and Schultz, 
1979; Schulze-Siebert et al., 1984; Fiedler and Schultz, 1985; 
Mousedale and Coggins, 1985). Schmid and Amrhein (1995) 
have advanced a different convincing argument for chorismate 
biosynthesis in chloroplasts, which is that all cDNAs so far iso- 
lated for enzymes of the shikimate pathway encode N-terminal 
extensions of the native polypeptides with characteristics of 
transit peptides for chloroplast import. Moreover, when syn- 
thesized in vitro, severa1 of the precursor proteins are processed 
by and imported into isolated chloroplasts. Finally, when the 
amino acid sequences of these enzymes from different organ- 
isms are compared, in general greater similarities occur 
between plant and bacterial homologs than between plant and 
fungal homologs. This may reflect the endosymbiotic hypoth- 
esis of chloroplast evolution (Gray and Doolittle, 1982). Thus, 
it is reasonable to assume that at least some, if not all, choris- 
mate biosynthesis occurs in plastids. Even though all the 
enzymes of this pathway are synthesized on cytosolic ribo- 
somes and some unprocessed precursors are enzymatically 
active (Schmid et al., 1992), and even though great efforts have 
been expended to demonstrate cytosolic aromatic amino acid 
biosynthesis, conclusive evidence for a complete and active 
extraplastidial shikimate pathway is still outstanding (Forlani 
et al., 1994). 
Shikimate kinase may representa secondary control in the 
shikimate pathway and one of importance for secondary me- 
tabolism. One of the two €. colishikimate kinase isoenzymes 
is synthesized constitutively, and the synthesis of the other 
is under control of the tyr and trp repressors (Ely and Pittard, 
1979; DeFeyter and Pittard, 1986; Heatwole and Somerville, 
1992; Whipp and Pittard, 1995). Possibly more pertinent to 
plants is the observation that plant shikimate kinase is sub- 
ject to control by energy charge (Schmidt et al., 1990). Such 
a control could indicate that in plants, under energetically 
favorable conditions, carbon of shikimate is diverted from the 
main trunk of the pathway into secondary products or stored 
in the form of quinate and its derivatives. Little else is known 
about the regulation of quinate synthesis. 
Quinate degradation is also subject to regulation. In lower 
eukaryotes, the three enzymes of quinate breakdown to proto- 
catechuate are induced by quinate. This induction is governed 
by two regulatory proteins, a transcriptional activator and a 
transcriptional repressor. The two genes encoding these 
regulatory proteins appear to have evolved by splitting an early 
anabolic arom gene (Hawkins et al., 1993), giving an intrigu- 
ing glimpse into the evolution of fungal regulatory circuits. 
In higher plants, quinate can also be converted back into 
intermediates of the shikimate pathway either by oxidation to 
3-dehydroquinate or by dehydration directly to shikimate (Figure 3). Nothing is known about the regulation of the quinate 
dehydratase in plants. However, the activity of quinate dehydro- 
genase is regulated by reversible Ca2+-modulated protein 
phosphorylation at a serine residue (Ranjeva et al., 1983; 
Graziana et al., 1984; Ranjeva and Boudet, 1987). This modu- 
lation of quinate dehydrogenase, coupled with the recent 
finding of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels in plant plasma 
membranes (Thuleau et al., 1993, 1994), may announce the 
end of the era in which quinate was “a Cinderella still awaiting 
a ticket to the ball” (Haslam, 1993); the Cinderella may be slip- 
ping into her shoes right now. 
OUTLOOK 
The shikimate pathway is one of the major biosynthetic path- 
ways in higher plants. In excess of one-fifth of all fixed carbon 
flows through this metabolic sequence. All enzymes of the shiki- 
mate pathway have been isolated and their kinetic parameters 
characterized. Some of the reaction mechanisms have been 
studied in detail. The primary structures of all but one of the 
enzymes have been obtained through the combined efforts 
of protein and DNA sequencing, and the first three-dimensional 
structures are appearing. The seven reactions of the pathway 
are identical in bacteria, eukaryotic microorganisms, and plants. 
The plant enzymes seem more closely related evolutionarily 
to their bacterial than to their fungal homologs. 
The available information is insufficient to make a similar 
statement about the regulation of this pathway. Some regulatory 
mechanisms have been described, and they differ substan- 
tially between these groups of organisms. Carbon flow into 
the bacterial and fungal shikimate pathway is controlled by 
feedback inhibition of aromatic amino acid-sensitive DAHP 
synthase isoenzymes. Plant DAHP synthases are not inhibited 
by the aromatic amino acids. 
Genetic control of the bacterial shikimate pathway is at the 
transcriptional leve1 by aromatic amino acid-mediated repres- 
sion. The pathway in yeast is under GCNCmediated general 
amino acid control, a combined transcription-translation activa- 
tion. Plant DAHP synthase mRNA levels reflect environmental 
stimuli. However, neither transcriptional repression nor tran- 
scriptional or translational activation of gene expression has 
yet been described. Promoter analysis has revealed DNA mo- 
tifs for wound induction and tissue-specific expression (L.M. 
Weaver, J. Zhao, and K.M. Herrmann, unpublished data), but 
trans-acting factors have so far been elusive. 
Mutants lacking one of the DAHP synthase isoenzymes have 
not yet been described. In addition, a major step forward in 
our understanding of the mechanism of wound- and elicitor- 
induced elevation of DAHP synthase will come with the isola- 
tion of mutants with lesions in this signal transduction pathway. 
One intracellular locale of the shikimate pathway is the 
plastid, but it remains to be seen whether this is the only site 
of chorismate biosynthesis. Using immunocytochemistry, DAHP 
synthase cross-reacting material is found in the secondary cell The Shikimate Pathway 915 
wall of mature xylem vessel elements (Herrmann et al., 1991). 
This finding suggests two functions for this protein: a catalytic 
function as the first enzyme in lignin biosynthesis and a struc- 
tural function in the lignified secondary cell wall. 
Such dual functions of polypeptides may not be uncommon. 
The petunia gene encoding EPSP synthase is expressed very 
highly in flower petals and much less in leaves and other tis- 
sues. Deletion analysis of a petunia EPSP synthase promoter 
in transgenic petunia plants identified tissue-specific cis- 
regulatory sequences that are -800 bp upstream of the tran- 
scription start site (Benfey et al., 1990). These regulatory 
sequences are larger than 500 bp and consist of severa1 widely 
separated elements. Further evidence of high-leve1 EPSP syn- 
thase expression in flowers comes from the finding that when 
the EPSP synthase promoter was used to drive the expres- 
sion of the maize A7 gene, which encodes an enzyme of 
anthocyanin biosynthesis, the resulting transgenic petunia 
plants showed pink flower petals, in contrast with colorless pe- 
tals of the parenta1 line. The significance of high levels of EPSP 
synthase in flower petals is not obvious. Possibly, the polypep- 
tide serves a structural function as well as an enzymatic 
function. 
A third example of a dual function plant protein appears to 
be threonine deaminase. This enzyme catalyzes the first step 
in isoleucine biosynthesis (see Singh and Shaner, 1995, this 
issue), but it is also the major protein of floral parenchyma cells 
in tomato (Samach et al., 1991). Again, this protein may have 
two functions: an enzymatic function in isoleucine biosynthe- 
sis, and a structural function in a terminally differentiated cell. 
Additional experimental evidence is necessary before DAHP 
synthase, EPSP synthase, and threonine deaminase can be 
firmly established as dual function proteins analogous with 
those that have been described in a number of other eukary- 
otic systems (Wistow, 1993). Thus, future studies on the 
shikimate pathway not only may identify signals from second- 
ary products that affect control points in primary metabolic 
pathways but also may contribute basic insights into processes 
of intracellular protein trafficking. In the coming years, experi- 
mentation on the shikimate pathway can be expected to have 
a major impact on these two research areas unique to plants.
