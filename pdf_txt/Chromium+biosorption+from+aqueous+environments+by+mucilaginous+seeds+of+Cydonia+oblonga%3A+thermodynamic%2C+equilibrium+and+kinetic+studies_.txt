Abstract  
Hexavalent chromium  Cr(VI)  is one of the most toxic heavy 
metal s in aqueous solutions , hence it is highly imperative 
to treat the wastewater containing Cr(VI) before its 
discharge. At present work, t he rate of biosorption was 
studied under a variety of conditions, including initial Cr(VI) 
concentration (5 -50 mg/ L), am ount of biosorbent (0.5 -3 
g/100 m L), pH (1 -8), temperature (29 8-318 K) and contact 
time (30 -120 min). Biosorption of Cr(VI) is in all cases pH -
dependent showing a maximum at equilibrium pH values 
between 2 and 3.  The biosorption data fitted well with 
Langm uir and Freundlich isotherm s. The biosorption 
capacity calculated from the Langmuir isotherm was q = 
33.58 mg Cr(VI)/g of dry seeds  (at 303 K) . Biosorption 
kinetics data well fitted using pseudo -second -order. 
Thermodynamic studies confirmed that biosorptio n of 
Cr(VI) ions by mucilaginous seeds of Cydonia oblonga  was 
spontaneous and endothermic nature.

1. Introduction   
Heavy metals are commonly found in various industrial 
wastewaters  and can cause serious water pollution and 
threaten the environment.  Among the heavy metals, 
chromium is being one of the important heavy metal 
pollutants present in the environment. Chromium and its 
compounds are extensively used in industry, with the mos t 
usual and important sources coming from the alloy 
reparation, metal cleaning and processing, leather tanning, 
wood preservation, ore processing, and petroleum refining 
processes (Acosta et al. , 2004; Hamadi et al. , 2001) . In the 
effluents from these indu stries, chromium is present 
primarily as hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and trivalent 
chromium (Cr(III)). Nevertheless, hexavalent form is five 
hundred times more toxic than the trivalent one (Mohan et 
al., 2005) . Cr(VI) has been classified as a Group I huma n 
carcinogen by International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) and as a Group A inhalation carcinogen by US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Hamadi et al. , 
2001) . Cr(VI) is considered as a common teratogenic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic chemicals  and the presence of 
Cr(VI) ions in the environment is posing serious problems 
and causing great public concern, which significantly 
motivates the investigation and development of new and 
improved materials to address the problems  (Wang et al. , 
2011; Zhou et al. , 2008) . In addition, a long -term exposure 
of Cr(VI) to mankind may cause severe physical disorders, 
such as dermatitis and the malfunctioning of the liver, 
kidney, circulatory and nervous systems (Dubey and Gopal, 
2007) . 
The US EPA requires 0.05 and  0.1 mg/L of Cr(VI) in drinking 
water and surface waters, respectively.  Furthermore, the 
permissible limit of Cr(VI) for industrial effluents to be 
discharged to the surface water is 0.1 mg/L and for potable 
water it is 0.05 mg/ L by World Health Organizat ion 
Consequently, chromium containing wastewaters must be 
treated to lower Cr(VI) levels to allowable limits before 
discharging into the environment (Altun and Pehlivan, 
2012; WHO, 2006) . Various processes have been used for 
treating Cr(VI) containing wast ewater, including electro -
chemical precipitation, lime coagulation, 
oxidation/reduction, ion exchange, membrane 
ultrafiltration,  solvent extraction, and adsorption (Olmez, 
2009; Bazrafshan et al. , 2008; Alguacil et al. , 2004) . 
Nevertheless , these technique s can be inefficient and 
normally  not cost -effective. During the last decades, a new 
technique of biosorption has been proposed  and 
considered  to remove but also recover many metals 
including  chromium (Pachero et al. , 2011) . The removal of 
metallic  ions fr om an aqueous  solution through binding to 
various biomasses has been referred to  as biosorption.  
Biosorption is considered as a promising technology for 
toxic metal elimination, thanks to the low -cost and easily 
available biosorbents, regeneration ability and the high 
eliminating efficiency for a variety of heavy metals  (Hou et 
al., 2012) . 
Various materials have been suggested for biosorption 
process including, algae, oysters, bacteria, yeast and 
various plants (Pachero et al. , 2011; Bazrafshan et al. , 2012 ; 
Bazrafshan et al. , 2013a; Bazrafshan et al. , 2013b) . In 270  BAZRAFSHAN  et al.  
addition , removal of chromium by using various naturally 
available biomaterials such as seeds of Ocimum 
americanum  (Lakshmanraj et al. , 2009) , eucalyptus bark 
(Sarin and Pant, 2006)  and saw dust, su gar cane bagasse 
and sugar beet pulp (Sharma and Foster, 1994)  have been 
studied for the removal of Cr(VI) ions from 
water/wastewater . 
In the present study the biosorption of Cr(VI) on to 
mucilaginous seeds of Cydonia oblonga  was investigated.  
The effects initial pH, reaction time and Cr(VI) 
concentration  on the binding of chromium to the  Cydonia 
oblonga  was investigated as well as the capacity of the 
biosorbent for Cr(VI) at different  temperatures. The 
thermodynamics of the binding process were investigate d, 
which included determining the ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS. The 
kinetics of the sorption process was studied at 
temperatures of 29 8-318 K. In addition , adsorption 
isotherms were studied at various temperatures. The 
isotherm provides a relationship between the 
concentration of Cr(VI) in solution and the amount of Cr(VI) 
adsorbed on the solid phase when both phases are in 
equilibrium.  
2. Experimental  
2.1. Biosorbent  preparation   
The seed s of Cydonia oblonga  used in this study were 
obtained from local area. The seed s are washed with 
distilled water to remo ve dirt and other particulate matter. 
The washing procedure was continued till the wash water 
contained no color.  The seed contains a thin outer layer 
having larger capacity of hydration. After soaking in 
distilled water, the outer layer of seeds swells wh ich appear 
as a white gel . The dry seeds were black in color and ovoid 
in shape with mean size approximately 2 mm length and 
1.5 mm width. When the seeds were soaked in water, they 
swell ed and sorbed more water. The average size of 
swollen seeds was 4 -5 mm . The swollen part was white 
mucilage composed.   
The required quantity of seeds was taken in a test tube (60 
mL) containing two third volume of water and allowed to 
swell for about 40 min. The mouth of the test tube was 
tightly plugged  (for any probable le akage) . The test tube 
was then placed in a boiling water bath for 60 min. After 
boiling, the water -seed suspension  was passed through 
sieves to drain the excess water. The mucilaginous seeds 
were washed in fresh distilled water. After that they were 
direct ly used as an adsorbent. A fresh biosorbent was 
prepared by following the above procedure for daily 
experiments.  
2.2. Preparation of  stock solution  (absorbate)   
All chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade. 
Standard stock Cr(VI) solution (1000 mg/L) was prepared by 
dissolving K 2Cr2O7 salt in deionized water and desired 
solutions were prepared by dilution of the stock solution.  
The pH was adjusted using 1N H 2SO 4 and 1N NaOH. Fresh 
dilutions were used for each study.  
2.3. Analysis   The residual c oncentration of Cr(VI)  was determined 
spectrophotometrically ( Hach digital UV -Vis 
spectrophotometer, model DR/5000 ) at 540 nm using the 
diphenyl carbazide reagent  (Sen and Ghosh Dastidar, 
2007) . A standard graph of absorbance vs concentration 
was obtained for known chromium concentrations. The 
absorbance value of sample was used to determine the 
unknown concentration.  
2.4. Batch sorption experiments   
The adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted at 
laboratory temperature (2 3±2 °C) by varying the 
concen trations from 5 to 50 mg/L. Aliquots of 100 mL 
chromium solution at different concentrations were taken 
in 250 mL conical flasks and pH was adjusted to 2 using 1N 
H2SO 4 and 1 N NaOH. The boiled swollen mucilaginous 
seeds  of Cydonia oblonga  (after grinding) equivalent to 1.0 
g dry weight were  added to each conical flask. Then, the 
flasks were placed in a rotary shaker maintained at 1 50 rpm 
for 24 h.  
The amount of Cr(VI) adsorbed per unit mass of biosorbent 
qe (mg/g) was calculated as follows :

where C o and C e are the initial and equilibrium 
concentrations of Cr(VI) (mg/L), respectively. V is the 
volume of chromium  solution (L) and M is the mass  of 
adsorbent used (g).  Adsorption isotherms were performed 
at temperatures of 29 8, 303, 30 8, 313  and 3 18 K, 
respectively. The flasks were shaken to ensure that the 
sorption process reached equilibrium.  
To express the percent of Cr(VI) removal, the following 
equation was used:

where C i and C f represent the initial and  final (after 
sorption) Cr(VI) concentrations, respectively.  
2.4.1. Effect of pH on Cr(VI) uptake/sorption  
The effect of pH on Cr(VI) sorption was studied by varying 
the pH from 2 to 8. The initial concentration of Cr(VI) 
solution used for this study was 1 5 mg/L. The biosorbent 
dosage was equivalent to 1.0 g dry weight of boiled 
mucilaginous seeds.  Flasks were agitated on a rotary shaker  
at 150 rpm for 90 min . The suspensions  were then filtered 
through Whatman 42 filter paper and the concentration of 
Cr(VI) in the filtrates was analyzed . The above procedure 
was repeated three times and the average value was taken.  
2.4.2. Effect of sorbent  dose   
Batch biosorption experiments were done at a different 
concentration s of biosorbent from 0.5 g to 3.0 g in a 100 
mL solution of 15 mg/L of Cr(VI) at pH  2.0, for a contact 
time of 90 min at 23±2 °C . The samples were then agitated 
and filtered and the filtrates were analyzed as mentioned 
before.  CHROMIUM BIOSORPTION FROM AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS BY MUCILAGINOUS SEEDS OF CYDONIA OBLONGA  271 
2.4.3. Effect of contact time  and initial concentration of 
Cr(VI)  
Batch biosorption experiments were carried out at 
different contact times ( 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150  min) and 
different  initial concentration s of Cr(VI) (5, 15, 25, 40 and 
50 mg/L) at pH 2.0. The Cydonia oblonga  dosage was 1.0 g 
in 100 mL solution in 250 mL conical fl ask at 23±2 °C . The 
samples were then agitated  (150 rpm)  and filtered. The 
filtrates were analyzed as mentioned before.  
2.4.4. Isotherm studies  
Adsorption isotherm studies were carried out with 
different initial concentrations of Cr(VI) (5, 15, 25, 40 and 
50 mg/L) and fixed doses of biosorbent at initial pH 2. The 
adsorbent dosage was equivalent to 1.0 g dry weight of 
boiled mucilaginous seeds. I n order to study  the adsorption 
isotherm, three equilibrium isotherms including Langmuir, 
Freundlich and Temkin were analyzed . 
2.4.5. Effect of temperature on equilibrium studies  
Thermodynamic parameters of the biosorption process 
were  determined by carrying out batch mode  experiments 
at various  initial Cr(VI)  concentration in the range  5-50 
mg/L , with all other expe rimental conditions were kept 
constant . The temperatures chosen for this study were in 
the range 298-318 K. Furthermore, k inetic studies were 
also carried out at different time intervals and Cr(VI) 
concentration  but at  fixed biosorbent dose and pH.  
3. Results  and discussion  
3.1. Effect of initial  pH  
The pH of solution plays a critical role in the biosorption 
process of metals. Generally, pH has a profound influence 
on sorption of metals. Consequently , in this study the role 
of pH in the maximum removal of Cr( VI) ions was examined 
over a pH range of 2 -8, to find the optimum pH for the 
sorption process and also to see whether biosorbent  shows 
good uptake over a broad pH range. Cr(VI)  uptake was 
affected by the change in pH and maximum removal 
efficiency of Cr(VI ) occurs at initial pH ranging from 2 to 4 
(91.7 -97.4 %) and decreases at  lower and higher pH values 
as depicted in (Fig . 1). The maximum biosorption capacity 
was found to be 14.61 mg/g for Cr(VI)   at pH 2. In contrast, 
removal efficiency at pH 8.0 was only  49.1% and 
biosorption capacity was 7.36 mg/g. The optimum 
biosorption of Cr(VI) by seeds mucilaginous of Cydonia 
oblonga  at low pH may be attributed to the presence of 
large amount of hydrogen ions (H+) at such pH levels, which 
neutralize the negatively c harged adsorbent surface and 
thus reduce hindrance to the diffusion of Cr (VI) anions. At 
high pH values, the abundance of hydroxide ions (OH-) 
increases hindrance to diffusion of Cr(VI) anions, thereby 
reducing the removal efficiency (Rao et al. , 2002) . On the 
other hand, in highly acidic media, the adsorbent surface 
might be highly protonated and favour the uptake of Cr(VI) 
in the anionic form HCrO 4-. Maximum sorption at pH 2.0 
indicates that it is the HCrO 4- form of Cr(VI) which is 
adsorbed preferentiall y on the adsorbents  (Cimino et al. , 
2000) . Furthermore, the findings  attribute that pH of solution affects the solubility of metals and the ionization 
state of the functional groups like carboxylate, phosphate 
and amino groups of the cell walls of the biom aterial 
(Popuri et al. , 2007) . Industrial effluents  containing Cr(VI), 
generally has low pH. Consequently , no pH adjustments 
would be required prior to biosorption  process , thereby 
reducing the cost of Cr(VI) biosorption process.  Similar 
finding was report ed by Lakshmanraj et al.  (2009) .  
 
Figure 1. Effect of initial pH on Cr(VI) biosorption by seeds 
of Cydonia oblonga  (Cr(VI) concentration = 15 mg/L, 
biosorbent do se = 1 g/100 ml, time = 90 min)  
3.2. Effect of biosorbent dose  on Cr(VI) biosorption  
The depe ndence of Cr(VI) ions onto mucilaginous seeds of 
Cydonia oblonga  as a biosorbent was conducted in various 
biosorbent dosages ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 g /L while 
keeping other parameters constant, such as pH (2), initial 
concentration (15 mg/L) and contact ti me (90 min) as 
constant. Fig. 2 shows the Cr(VI) concentration of the 
solution as a function of dosage of biosorbent. As it can be 
seen from Fig. 2, the removal efficiency of Cr(VI ) increased 
with the increase in dosage of biosorbent, as expected.  
However,  about 93 -97% of the Cr(VI) ions were effectively 
removed at the biosorbent dosage of 0.5-1.0 g where as 
97.93 % removal was achieved at the dosage of 3 g with the 
initial Cr(VI) concentration of 15 mg/L.  In fact, the uptake 
of the Cr(VI)  increased rapidly with increased amount of 
biosorbent from 0. 5 to 1.0 g and slowed down from 1.0 to 
3.0 g. This result can be explained by the fact that the 
sorption sites remain unsaturated during the sorption; 
whereas the number of sites available for sorption site 
increa ses by increasing the adsorbent dosage.  
In contrast, a  steady decrease in biosorption capacity, q e 
with increasing mass dose was observed for Cr(VI) ion as 
shown in Fig . 2. Reduction in metal uptake, qe, by Cydonia 
oblonga  with increasing biomass concentra tion was 
attributed to an insufficiency of metal ions in solution with 
respect to available binding sites (Fourest and Roux, 1992) . 
Other studies having similar result have been reported 
(Bazrafshan et al. , 2016b, Bazrafshan et al. , 2013a) . Higher 
specific  uptake at lower dry mass concentrations has also 
been attributed to an increased metal -to-biosorbent ratio, 
which decreases upon an increase in dry mass 
concentration (Puranik and Pakniker, 1999) .

by seeds of  Cydonia oblonga  (Cr(VI)  concentration = 15 
mg/L, initial pH = 2, time = 90 min)  
3.3. Effect of  contact time and initial concentration of 
chromium  
The pollutant  concentration and contact time between 
biosorbent and pollutant  species play a sig nificant role in 
the process of removal of pollutants from aqueous 
solutions by biosorption at a particular temperature and 
pH. The effects of initial Cr(VI)  concentration and contact 
time on the removal rate of Cr(VI)  by the Cydonia oblonga  
are shown in F ig. 3. 
As it can be seen from Fig.  3, Cr(VI) removal is increased 
with increasing the contact time at all initial Cr(VI) 
concentrations. For the first 45 min, the biosorption uptake 
was rapid (4 3.7-79.6%), then it proceeds at a slower 
sorption rate and fin ally did not increase significantly up to 
120 min. In the initial stages the removal efficiency of Cr(VI) 
at all concentrations increased rapidly due to the abundant 
availability of active binding sites on the biomass, and with 
gradual occupancy of these s ites, the sorption became less 
efficient in the later stages (Costa and Leite, 1991) . In fact, 
the biosorption kinetics of heavy metal ions consisted of 
two phases; an initial rapid phase where the biosorption 
was rapid and contributed significantly to the  equilibrium 
biosorption, and a slower second phase whose 
contribution to the total metal biosorption was relatively 
small. The first phase of biosorption kinetics lasted for 
almost an hour. The trend of Cr(VI) biosorption was typical 
of metal binding to b iomass by means of physicochemical 
interactions. Such particular behavior could have been due 
to the non -homogeneity of the biomass surface which 
possesses functional groups differing in dissociability and in 
Cr(VI) adsorption rates (Matheickal et al. , 199 9). 
In addition, as shown in Fig. 3, when the initial Cr(VI) 
concentration is increased, the percent of Cr(VI) removal 
decreased. For example, t he percentage removal 
decreases from 89.4% to 8 3.1% when Cr(VI) concentration 
increases from 5 to 50 mg/l with t he same contact time and 
sorption temperature.  In contrast when the initial Cr(VI) 
concentration is increased, the amounts of adsorbed Cr(VI) 
also increased, so the removal of Cr(VI) depends on its 
concentration in the solution. For example, when the initi al 
Cr(VI) concentration increases from 5 to 50 mg/L (at 
contact time 15 min), the equilibrium sorption capacity of 
biosorbent increased from 0.286 to 2.359 mg/g. This increase in the proportion of removed Cr(VI) may be 
probably due to equilibrium shift dur ing sorption process. 
On the other hand, it may be due to an increase in the 
number of Cr(VI) ions for the fixed amount of biosorbent. 
The amount of Cr(VI) adsorbed per unit mass of biosorbent 
increases with increase in Cr(VI) concentration, may be due 
to the complete utilization of adsorption surface and active 
sites available which is not possible in low concentration.  
Similar findings w ere reported by Babu and Gupta (Babu 
and Gupta, 2008)  on Cr(VI) removal by using activated 
Neem leaves  and Ofomaja et al . on copper(II) biosorption 
onto pine cone powder  (Ofomaja et al. , 2010) .

seeds of  Cydonia oblonga  (initial pH 2 and sorbent dose  
10g/L)  
3.4. Effect of temperature on Cr(VI) biosorption and 
thermo dynamic studies  
The biosorption of Cr(VI) ion on Cydonia oblonga  was 
investigated as a function of temperature and the 
maximum removal of Cr(VI) ion was obtained at 318 K. The 
batch biosorption experiments were performed at 
different temperatures of 298, 3 03, 308, 313 and 318 °K for 
the initial Cr(VI) ion concentrations in the range of 5 -50 
mg/L at constant biosorbent concentration of 10 g/L and 
optimum pH value of 2.  As presented in Fig. 4, biosorption 
of Cr(VI) increased from 82.9 -91.9% to 91.4 -94.7 % with  
increase in temperature from 298 -318 °K for different 
initial Cr(VI) concentrations (5 -50 mg/L).  Similar finding s 
was reported by Ofomaja et al.  on biosorption of copper(II) 
and lead(II) onto potassium hydroxide treated pine cone 
powder  (Ofomaja et al. , 2010) . In addition, a similar finding 
was reported by Sahu et al.  on Cr(VI) removal from aqueous 
solution using Tamarind wood activated carbon  (Sahu et 
al., 2009) . The increase in metal uptake with increasing 
temperature was attributed  to either higher affi nity of sites 
for metal or an increase in number of binding sited on 
activated carbon.  
In order to determine the thermodynamic parameters, 
some experiments were carried out at different 
temperature 298 -318 K for Cr(VI) biosorption. The Gibbs 
free energy of  the sorption was calculated by the following 
equation:  
f0K ln RT - G
 (3) 
CHROMIUM BIOSORPTION FROM AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS BY MUCILAGINOUS SEEDS OF CYDONIA OBLONGA  273 
0 0 0ST - H G 
 (4) 
where R is universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol/K) and T is 
the absolute temperature in K. The thermodynamic 
parameter, Gibb’s free energy change , ∆G°, is calculated 
using K f obtained from Freundlich Eq. (7) and shown in 
Table 2. The values of enthalpy ( ΔH0) and entropy change (
ΔS0) can be obtained from the slope of the plot of ΔG0 
versus T . A plot of Gibb’s free energy change, ΔG°, against 
tempera ture, T, was found to be linear (Figure 5).  
The negative values of ∆G° confirm the feasibility of the 
process and also the spontaneous nature of biosorption 
with a high preference of Cr(VI) ions by Cydonia oblonga . 
Furthermore, the decrease in the negative  value of ∆G° 
with an increase in temperature indicates that the 
adsorption process of Cr(VI) ions on Cydonia oblonga  
becomes more favorable at higher temperatures  (Zaki et 
al., 2000) . 
 
Figure 4. Effect of temperature on Cr(VI) ions biosorption 
onto  seeds  of Cydonia oblonga  (pH=2, sorbent dose=10g/L 
and contact time =90 min)  
Adsorption process can be classified as physical adsorption 
and chemisorption by the magnitude of the enthalpy ( ΔH0) 
change. It is accepted that if magnitude of enthalpy change 
is less  84 kJ/mol, adsorption is physical. However 
chemisorption takes place range from 84 to 420 kJ/mol 
(Errais et al. , 2011; Bazrafshan et al. , 2016a; Bazrafshan et 
al., 2014). From these results (Table 1) it is clear that 
physisorption is much more favorable f or the biosorption 
of Cr(VI) ions.

318 -0.964  
Also, the positive value of ∆H° indicates that the sorption 
reaction is endothermic. Entropy ( ΔS0) has been defined as 
the degree of ch aos of a system. The positive value of ∆S° 
suggests that some structural changes occur on the adsorbent and the randomness at the solid/liquid interface 
in the adsorption system increases during the adsorption 
process (Gupta, 1998).

3.5. Equilibrium  isotherm  
An important physiochemical aspect in terms of the 
evaluation of sorption processes is the sorption 
equilibrium. In fact, the isotherm provides a relationship 
between the concentratio n of sorbate  in solution and its 
amount adsorbed on the solid phase when both phases are 
in equilibrium. In order to investigate the adsorption 
isotherm, three  equilibrium isotherms were analyzed: the 
Langmuir, Freundlich  and Temkin isotherm.  
3.5.1. Langmu ir isotherm  
This isotherm model is valid for monolayer adsorption onto 
surface containing finite number of identical sorption sites. 
The saturated monolayer isotherm can be represented as:  
elelm
eCK1CKqq
 (5) 
where q e is the amount of metal adsorbe d per unit mass  of 
adsorbent (mg /g), C e is equilibrium concentration of the 
solution (mg /L), and q m is the maximum amount of metal 
ions required to form a monolayer (mg /g). The Langmuir 
equation can be rearranged to linear form for the 
convenience of plott ing and determining the Langmuir 
constants (K L) and maximum monolayer adsorption 
capacity of biosorbent  (qm). The values of q m and K L can be 
determined from the linear plot of 1/q e versus 1/C e:

3.5.2. Freundlich isotherm  
The Fre undlich equation is purely empirical based on 
sorption on heterogeneous surface, which is commonly 
described by the following equation:

where, K f and 1/n are the Freundlich constants

Freundlich equilibrium constants were evaluated from the 
intercept and the slope, respectively of the linear plot of 
log q e versus log C e based on experimental data.

 (8) 
3.5.3. Temkin isotherm  
The Temkin isotherm, assumes that the fall in the heat of 
sorption is linear and the distribution of binding energies as 
uniform (up to some maximum binding energy). This model 
takes into account the presence of indirect 
adsor bate/adsorbent interactions and suggests that 
because of these interactions the heat of adsorption of all 
molecules in the layer would decrease linearly with 
coverage. The Temkin isotherm has generally been applied 
in the following form:  
e T e C ln B K ln B q  (9) 
The constant K T and B 1 can be calculated using a linear plot 
of qe versus ln C e. K T is the equilibrium blinding constant 
(L/mg) corresponding to maximum binding energy and 
constant B 1 is related to heat of adsorption .  
As presented at Table 2, the experimental data well fitted 
with all studied  isotherm model s. Nevertheless, 
equilibrium studies showed that the Freundlich isotherm 
gave a better ﬁt for the equilibrium data .   
The Langmuir capacity from this study was compared with 
those obtained by other biosorbents (Table 3). In 
comparison with other costly and l ow cost adsorbents, the 
results of the present study indicate that biosorbent 
prepared from Cydonia oblonga  has a good sorption 
capacity.

3.6. Adsorption kinetics  
Several kinetic models are in use to explain the mechanism 
of the sorption processes. In order to evaluate the kinetics 
of th e sorption process, data from the kinetic studies were 
fitted into the pseudo -first-order and pseudo -second -order 
models. Kinetic sorption of heavy metals from wastewater 
has been studied using mostly pseudo -first-order and 
pseudo -second -order models. The first kinetic model evaluated was the pseudo -first-order Lagergren’s 
equation , shown in Eq. ( 10); 
303.2/tk qelog)qt qe( log1
 (10) 
Thus, a plot of log (q e -qt) versus t provides the kinetic 
parameters k1 and log qe from the slope and intercept, 
respectively.  
The second -order kinetic model (Bazrafshan et al. , 2015)  is 
expressed as:  CHROMIUM BIOSORPTION FROM AQUEOUS ENVIRONMENTS BY MUCILAGINOUS SEEDS OF CYDONIA OBLONGA  275 
e2
e2 t qt
qk1
qt
 (11) 
where k2 is the pseudo -second -order rate constant 
(g/mg/min); q e the quantity of metal ions sorbed at 
equilibrium (mg/g); qt the quantity of metal ions s orbed at 
time t (mg/g) and t is the time (min).  
If second -order kinetics is applicable, a plot of t/qt versus t 
should show a linear correlation and the rate constant of 
the second -order adsorption k2 and q e can be calculated 
from the slope and intercept o f this plot, respectively. This 
model is more likely to predict the behavior over the whole 
range of adsorption and is in agreement with chemical 
sorption being the rate -controlling step.  The rate constants 
and the  correlation coefficients are  also summari zed in 
Table 4. Figure 6 shows the plot of log (q e - qt) versus time 
for the experimental data obtained under the optimized 
conditions (pH 6, contact time 120 min and mixing rate 150 
rpm). It can be seen that a linear relationship of log (q e - qt) 
against time was observed during the initial 120 min of 
biosorption, and then deviates from linearity from 120 min 
onwards. Therefore, the attachment of Cr(VI) ions to the 
biosorbent surface controlled the initial sorption of 
pollutants. However, when the biosorpt ion time was 120 
min and greater the experimental data fitted very well with 
the pseudo -second -order kinetics reaction (Fig ure 7). Similar kinetic results were reported in the treatment of 
biodiesel wastewater by sorption with commercial 
chitosan flakes.  
Analysis of the experimental data with the pseudo -second 
order kinetic model shows good agreement of the sets of 
data, which is reflected in the extremely high correlation 
coefficient of determination, obtained (Table 4 and Fig ure 
7). Similar findings were reported by Babu·and Gupta 
(2008) on adsorption of Cr(VI) by using activated neem 
leaves .

4. Conclusions  
Hexavalent chromium is one of the most toxic heavy metals 
in aqueous solutions.  Biosorption o f Cr(VI) ions on to Cydonia oblonga  has been studied. Biosorption capacity of 
the Cr(VI) ions was shown to be dependent on initial 
solution pH. Both the pseudo -ﬁrst and pseudo -second 
order kinetic models were applied to analyze the 
biosorption kinetics. Biosorption kinetics data well fitted  
using pseudo -second -order. Thermodynamic studies 
confirmed that biosorption of Cr(VI) ions by mucilaginous 
seeds of Cydonia oblonga  was spontaneous and 
endothermic nature. Finally, the results demonstrated the 
technical feasibility of biosorption by Cydon ia oblonga  as a 
reliable technique for removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous 
solutions.
