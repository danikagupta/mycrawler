The cupuassu shell (Theobroma grandi ﬂorum) which is a food residue was used in its natural form as
biosorbent for the removal of C.I. Reactive Red 194 and C.I. Direct Blue 53 dyes from aqueous solutions.
This biosorbent was characterized by infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and nitrogen
adsorption/desorption curves. The effects of pH, biosorbent dosage and shaking time on biosorption
capacities were studied. In acidic pH region (pH 2.0) the biosorption of the dyes were favorable. The
contact time required to obtain the equilibrium was 8 and 18 h at 298 K, for Reactive Red 194 and Direct
Blue 53, respectively. The Avrami fractionary-order kinetic model provided the best ﬁt to experimental
data compared with pseudo- ﬁrst-order, pseudo-second-order and chemisorption kinetic adsorption
models. The equilibrium data were ﬁtted to Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips and Radke ePrausnitz isotherm
models. For both dyes the equilibrium data were best ﬁtted to the Sips isotherm model.

1. Introduction
Dyes are one of the most hazardous chemical compound class
found in industrial ef ﬂuents which need to be treated since their
presence in water bodies reduces light penetration, precluding the
photosynthesis of aqueous ﬂora ( Pavan et al., 2008; Royer et al.,
2009a, 2009b, 2010a ). They are also aesthetically objectionable for
drinking and other purposes. Dyes can also cause allergy, dermatitis,
skin irritation and also provoke cancer and mutation in humans
(Brookstein, 2009; de Lima et al., 2007; Rosenkranz et al., 2007 ).
Dyes are a kind of organic compound with a complex aromatic
molecular structure that can bring bright and ﬁrm color to other
materials. However, the complex aromatic molecular structures of
dyes make them more stable and more dif ﬁcult to biodegrade
(Calvete et al., 2010; Royer et al., 2010b ). The most ef ﬁcient method
for the removal of synthetic dyes from aqueous ef ﬂuents is the
adsorption procedure ( Al-Degs et al., 2008; Cestari et al., 2009;
Mittal et al., 2010; Rosa et al., 2008 ). This process transfers the
dyes from the water ef ﬂuent to a solid phase thereby keeping the
efﬂuent volume to a minimum ( Al-Degs et al., 2008; Calvete et al.,
2010 ). Subsequently, the adsorbent can be regenerated or stored ina dry place without direct contact with the environment ( Calvete
et al., 2009, 2010 ).
Activated carbon is the most employed adsorbent for dye
removal from aqueous solution because of its excellent adsorption
properties ( Calvete et al., 2009, 2010; Órfão et al., 2006; Olivares-
Marín et al., 2009 ). However, the extensive use of activated
carbon for dye removal from industrial ef ﬂuents is expensive,
limiting its large application for wastewater treatment ( Crini, 2006;
Gupta and Suhas, 2009 ). Therefore, there is a growing interest in
ﬁnding alternative low cost adsorbents for dye removal from
aqueous solution. Among these alternative adsorbents, it can be
cited: hazelnut shell, saw dust, walnut, saw dust cherry, saw dust
oak, saw dust pitch pine, saw dust pine, cane pitch, soy meal hull,
banana pitch ( Gupta and Suhas, 2009 ); sugar cane bagasse, cotton
waste, chitin and chitosan, peat, microorganisms such as fungus
and yeasts ( Crini, 2006 ); maize cob ( Crini, 2006; Gupta and Suhas,
2009 ); Brazilian pine-fruit shell ( Lima et al., 2008; Royer et al.,
2009b, 2010c ); mandarin peel, yellow passion fruit peel ( Pavan
et al., 2007 ); tree leaves ( Deniz and Saygideger, 2010 ); wood
shavings ( Jano /C20s et al., 2009 ); coffee bean ( Baek et al., 2010 ); babassu
(Vieira et al., 2009 ); marine algae ( Bekçi et al., 2009 ) etc.
Cupuassu ( Theobroma grandi ﬂorum ), is a tropical rainforest tree
related to cacao ( Gondim et al., 2001 ), native in the Brazilian
Amazon. Cupuassu trees usually range from 5 to 15 m in height
(Gondim et al., 2001 ), and cupuassu fruits are oblong, brown, and*Corresponding author. Tel.: þ55 (51) 3308 7175; fax: þ55 (51) 3308 7304.

provided by Elsevier - Publisher Connector fuzzy. They are 20 cm long, 1 e2 kg in weight, and covered with
a thick (4 e7 mm) hard exocarp ( Gondim et al., 2001 ). The pulp is
greatly appreciated for its pleasant acidic taste, being consumed
fresh or processed, mainly as juice, ice cream, candy and jellies. In
addition, the seeds can be used to make chocolate. The annual
production of cupuassu in the Brazilian Amazon is about 5200
tonnes ( Gondim et al., 2001 ). About 42% of weight of cupuassu is
its shell, which is a waste material that presents no aggregateeconomic value ( Gondim et al., 2001 ). The disposal of large
amounts of cupuassu shell (CS) directly in the soil and/or in naturalwaters may contaminate the environment in an uncontrolled way
because the decomposition of this waste material leads to the
generation of various chemical compounds and microorganisms. In
this context, combining the need to reduce costs with commercial
adsorbents and by using CS as biosorbent for the removal of dyes
from industrial ef ﬂuents, it is a good economical and environ-
mental advantage to in developing countries such as Brazil.
The present work aimed to use CS in natural form as biosorbent
for the successful removal of C.I. Direct Blue 53 (DB-53) and C.I.Reactive Red 194 (RR-194) dyes from aqueous solutions. These dyes
are largely used for textile dying in the Brazilian cloth industries.
2. Materials and methods2.1. Solutions and reagents
De-ionized water was used throughout the experiments for
solution preparations.
The textile dyes, C.I. Reactive Red 194 (RR-194; C.I. 18214; CAS
23354-52-1; C
27H18N7O16S5ClNa 4; 984.21 g mol/C01) was furnished by
Bosche Scienti ﬁc (New Brunswick, USA) at 80% of purity and C.I.
Direct Blue 53 (DB-53; C.I. 23860; CAS 314-13-6; C 34H24N6O14S4Na4;
960.81 g mol/C01) was furnished by Vetec (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) at 85%
of purity (see Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The dyes were used without
further puri ﬁcation. It should be pointed out that no color changes of
the dyes were observed when these were immersed in aqueous
solution ranging from pH 2.0 to 9.0. The RR-194 dye has three
sulfonate groups and one sulfato-ethyl-sulfone group, and the
DB-53 has four sulfonate groups. These groups present negative
charges even in highly acidic solutions due to their pKa values lower
than zero ( Lima et al., 2008 ). The stock solution was prepared by
dissolving the dyes in distilled water to the concentration of5.00 g L
/C01. Working solutions were obtained by diluting the dye
stock solutions to the required concentrations. To adjust the pHsolutions, 0.10 mol L
/C01sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid
solutions were used. The pH of the solutions was measured usinga Schott Lab 850 set pHmeter.
2.2. Adsorbent preparation and characterization
CS was furnished by jelly industry in Belém-PA, Brazil, as
a residual material. CS was washed with tap water to remove dust
and with de-ionized water. Then, it was dried at 343 K in an air-
supplied oven for 8 h. After that, CS was grounded in a disk-mill and
subsequently sieved. The part of biosorbent which presented
diameter of particles /C20250
mm was used.
The CS biosorbent was characterized by FTIR using a Shimadzu
FTIR, model 8300 (Kyoto, Japan). The spectra were obtained witha resolution of 4 cm
/C01, with 100 cumulative scans.
The surface analyses and porosity were carried out with
a volumetric adsorption analyzer, ASAP 2020, from Micromeritrics,
at 77 K (boiling point of nitrogen). The samples were pre-treated at
373 K for 24 h under a nitrogen atmosphere in order to eliminate
the moisture adsorbed on the solid sample surface. After, the
samples were submitted to 298 K in vacuum, reaching the residualpressure of 10/C04Pa. For area and pore calculations, the DBET and
BJH ( Arenas et al., 2007; Jacques et al., 2007 ) methods were used.
The biosorbent sample was also analyzed by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) in Jeol microscope, model JSM 6060, using anacceleration voltage of 20 kV and magni ﬁcation ranging from 100
to 5000 fold ( Vaghetti et al., 2008 ).
The point of zero charge (pH
pzc) of the adsorbent was deter-
mined by adding 20.00 mL of 0.050 mol L/C01NaCl to several
Erlenmeyer ﬂasks. A range of initial pH (pH i) values of the NaCl
solutions were adjusted from 2.0 to 10.0 by adding 0.1 mol L/C01of
HCl and NaOH. The total volume of the solution in each ﬂask was
brought to exactly 30.0 mL by further addition of 0.050 mol L/C01
NaCl solution. The pH ivalues of the solutions were then accurately
noted and 50.0 mg of CS was added to each ﬂask, which was
securely capped immediately. The suspensions were shaken in
a shaker at 298 K and allowed to equilibrate for 48 h. The
suspensions were then centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 10 min and the
ﬁnal pH (pH f) values of the supernatant liquid were recorded. The
value of pH pzcis the point where the curve of ΔpH (pH fepHi) versus
pHicrosses the line equal to zero ( Calvete et al., 2009 ).
2.3. Biosorption studies
The biosorption studies for evaluation of the CS biosorbent for
the removal of the RR-194 and DB-53 dyes from aqueous solutions
were carried out in triplicate using the batch contact biosorption
method. For these experiments, ﬁxed amounts of biosorbent
(20.0 e200.0 mg) were placed in 50.0 mL cylindrical high-density
polystyrene ﬂasks (height 117 mm and diameter 30 mm) containing
20.0 mL of dye solutions (10.00 e250.0 mg L/C01), which were agitated
for a suitable time (0.25 e48 h) at 298 K. Blanks without adsorbents
were carried out in order to verify the possibility of the dye beingadsorbed at the ﬂask. It was not observed any adsorption of the dye
at the high-density polystyrene ﬂask after 48 h of contact. The pH of
the dye solutions ranged from 2.0 to 9.0. Subsequently, in order to
separate the biosorbents from the aqueous solutions, the ﬂasks
were centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 10 min, and aliquots of 1 e10 mL of
supernatant were properly diluted with water.
Theﬁnal concentrations of the dyes remained in the solution
were determined by visible spectrophotometry by visible spectro-
photometry using a T90 þUVeVIS spectrophotometer furnished by
PG Instruments (London-England) provided with optical quartzcells. Absorbance measurements were made at the maximum
wavelength of RR-194 and DB-53 which were 505 and 607 nm.
The amount of dyes uptaken and the percentage of removal of
the dyes by the biosorbent were calculated by applying the Eqs. (1)
and (2), respectively:

adsorption procedure, and X is biosorbent dosage (g L/C01).

2.5. Quality assurance and statistical evaluation of the kinetic and
isotherm parameters
To establish the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of the
collected data, all the batch adsorption measurements were per-formed in triplicate. Blanks were run in parallel and they were
corrected when necessary ( Vaghetti et al., 2008 ).
All dye solutions were stored in glass ﬂasks, which were cleaned
by soaking in 1.4 mol L
/C01HNO 3for 24 h ( Lima et al., 2002 ), rinsing
ﬁve times with de-ionized water, dried, and stored in a ﬂow hood.
For analytical calibration, standard solutions with concentra-
tions ranging from 5.00 to 50.0 mg L/C01of RR-194 and DB-53 dyes
were employed, running against a blank solution of water adjusted
in a suitable pH. The linear analytical calibrations of the curves
were furnished by the software UVWin of the T90 þPG Instru-
ments spectrophotometer. The detection limits of the method,obtained with signal/noise ratio of 3 ( Lima et al., 1998 ), were 0.12
and 0.16 mg L
/C01, for RR-194 and DB-53, respectively. All the
analytical measurements were performed in triplicate, and the
precision of the standards was better than 3% ( n¼3). For checking
the accuracy of the RR-194 and DB-53 dye sample solutions duringthe spectrophotometric measurements, standards containing dyes
at 20.00 mg L
/C01were employed as quality control at each ﬁve
determinations ( Lima et al., 2003 ).
The kinetic and equilibrium models were ﬁtted by employing
a nonlinear method, with successive interactions calculated by the
method of Levenberg eMarquardt and also interactions calculated
by the Simplex method, using the nonlinear ﬁtting facilities of the
software Microcal Origin 7.0. In addition, the models were also
evaluated by adjusted determination factor (R2
adj), as well as by an
error function (F error)(Lima et al., 2007 ), which measures the
differences in the amount of dye taken up by the adsorbent pre-
dicted by the models and the actual qmeasured experimentally.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of biosorbents
FTIR technique was used to examine the surface groups of CS
biosorbent and to identify the groups responsible for the dyes
adsorption. Infrared spectra of the adsorbent and dye-loaded
adsorbent samples, before and after the adsorption process, were
recorded in the range 4000 e400 cm/C01.Fig. 1 AeC shows the FTIR
vibrational spectra of the CS before the adsorption (CS; Fig. 1 A) and
loaded with the RR-194 dye (CS þRR-194; Fig. 1 B) and with DB-53
(CSþDB-53, Fig. 1 C). The intense absorption bands at 3429, 3413,
and 3417 cm/C01are assigned to O eH bond stretching for CS,
CSþRR-194 and CS þDB-53, respectively ( Smith, 1999; Vaghetti
et al., 2009; Lima et al., 2008 ). The CH 2stretching band at
2918 cm/C01is assigned to asymmetric stretching of CH 2groups
(Smith, 1999; Vaghetti et al., 2008; Lima et al., 2008 ) which present
the same wavenumber before and after the adsorption with twodifferent dyes, indicating that this group did not participate in the
biosorption process. Bands at 1740, 1735 and 1736 cm
/C01, for CS,
CSþRR-194 and CS þDB-53, respectively are assigned to carbonyl
groups of carboxylic acid ( Smith, 1999; Vaghetti et al., 2009 ).
Several bands in the range of 1633-1321 are assigned to ring modesof the aromatic rings ( Smith, 1999 ). The wavenumbers of these
bands were practically the same before and after the biosorptionusing RR-194 and DB-53 dyes, indicating that aromatic groups do
not participate on the biosorption mechanism. A sharp band at
1254, 1239 and 1240 cm
/C01as well as the intense bands at 1057,1049 and 1050 cm/C01are assigned to C eO stretch of phenolic
compounds found in lignin ( Smith, 1999; Vaghetti et al., 2009 ) and
CeO stretching vibration of alcohols ( Smith, 1999 ), for CS, CS þRR-
194 and CS þDB-53, respectively. The FTIR results indicate that the
interaction of RR-194 and DB-53 dyes with the CS biosorbentshould occur with the O eH bonds of phenols and alcohols present
in the lignin structure as well as the interactions with the carbox-ylate group because these groups suffered a shift to lower wave-
numbers after the biosorption procedure. Similar results were
previously observed for adsorption of dyes on ﬂy ash ( Kara et al.,
2007 ) and activated carbon adsorbent ( Calvete et al., 2010 ).
The textural properties of CS obtained by nitrogen adsorption/
desorption curves were: super ﬁcial area (S
BET) 1.2 m2g/C01; average
pore diameter (BJH) 20.02 nm; and average pore volume
0.0073 cm3g/C01. The super ﬁcial area of agricultural residues is
usually a low value ( Kumari et al., 2006 ;Yurtsever and Sengil,
2009 ). On the other hand, the average pore diameter of CS
biomaterial is relatively large, even when compared with activatedcarbons ( Calvete et al., 2009; 2010 ) or silicates ( Royer et al., 2010a,
2010b ). The maximum diagonal lengths of the RR-194 and DB-53
(see supplementary Fig. 2 . The dimensions of the chemical
moleculae were calculated using ChemBio 3D
/C210Ultra version 11.0.)
are 2.05 and 1.47 nm, respectively. The ratios of average porediameter of the biosorbent to the maximum diagonal length of each
dye are 9.77 and 13.62, for RR-194 and DB-53, respectively.
Therefore, the mesopores of CS could accommodate up to 9 and 13
molecules of RR-194 and DB-53, respectively. This number of
molecules, which could be accommodated in each pore of the
biosorbent, is considered large when compared with other adsor-
bents reported in the literature ( Calvete et al., 2009, 2010 ;Lima
et al., 2008; Royer et al., 2009b ).

natural form without contact with dye solution ( Fig. 2 A and B) and
after contact with RR-194 dye solution at pH 2.0 ( Fig. 2 C and D) are
shown in Fig. 2 . As can be seen, CS biosorbent without contact with
dye solution is a more compact ﬁbrous material presenting some
macroporous (porous with diameter >50 nm; see Fig. 2 A and B).
On the other hand, after the CS biosorbent being submitted to an
RR-194 dye solution at pH 2.0, the cavities of the ﬁbrous materials
were expanded, which should allow the diffusion of dye moleculesthrough the macroporous of the CS biosorbent. Similar results
were also obtained with DB-53 after the contact with CS bio-
sorbent (data not shown). It is important to focus that using SEM
technique it is not possible to verify the presence of dye on the
biosorbent surface, since the scale of the micrograph is microme-
ters and the dimension of the dyes are in nanometer scale. The
changes provoked at cupuassu shell (cavities) should be attributed
to the acidic solution at pH 2.0.
Taking into account that CS biosorbent presents a low super ﬁcial
area (S
BET) and some macroporous (see Fig. 2 ), it could be inferred
that CS predominates a mixture of mesoporous (porous withdiameter ranging from 2 to 50 nm, see textural results describedabove) and macroporous (porous with diameter >50 nm). On the
other hand, the number of microporous (porous with a diame-ter<2 nm) should be a minimum ( Gay et al., 2010; Jacques et al.,
2007 ). Usually, the microporous structure is responsible for
higher super ﬁcial area (S
BET) of the materials ( Gay et al., 2010;
Kumari et al., 2006; Yurtsever and Sengil, 2009 ), since thenitrogen probe molecule utilized in the measurements is retained
basically at the microporous structure ( Arenas et al., 2007; Jacques
et al., 2007 ). This explains the low super ﬁcial area (S BET)o fC S
biosorbent.
3.2. Effects of acidity on adsorption
One of the most important factors in adsorption studies is the
effect of the acidity of the medium ( Lima et al., 2007, 2008; Royer
et al., 2009a, 2009b ). Different species may present divergent
ranges of suitable pH depending on which adsorbent is used.
Effects of initial pH on percentage of removal of RR-194 and DB-
53 dyes using CS biosorbent were evaluated within the pH range
between 2 and 9 ( Fig. 3 A and B, respectively). For both dyes, the
percentage of dye removal was remarkably decreased from pH
2.0, attaining practically less than 1% of dye removal at pH 6.5.
Similar behavior for dy e removal ut ilizing lignocellulosic adsor-
bents was also observed ( Akar et al., 2008; Deniz and Saygideger,
2010).
The pH PZCvalue determined for CS is 5.92. For pH values lower
than pH pzc,the adsorbent presents a positive surface charge
(Calvete et al., 2009; Lima et al., 2008 ). The dissolved RR-194 and
DB-53 dyes are negatively charged in water solutions. The
adsorption of these dyes takes place when the biosorbent presents
a positive surface charge. For CS, the electrostatic interaction occurs
for pH <5.92. However, the lower the pH value from the pH pzc, the
more positive the surface of the biosorbent ( Calvete et al., 2009 ).

dyes. The temperature was ﬁxed at 298 K.N.F. Cardoso et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 92 (2011) 1237 e1247 1241This behavior explains the high sorption capacity of CS for both RR-
194 and DB-53 at pH 2. In order to continue the biosorption studies,
the initial pH was ﬁxed at 2.0.
3.3. Adsorbent dosage
The study of biosorbent dosages for the removal of RR-194 and
DB-53 dyes from aqueous solution was carried out using bio-sorbent dosages ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 g L
/C01andﬁxing the
initial dye concentration at 50.0 mg L/C01. For both dyes, the highest
amount of dye removal was attained for biosorbent doses of at
least 2.5 g L/C01(Fig. 3 C and D, for RR-194 and DB-53, respectively).
For biosorbent dosages higher than this value, the removal of thedyes remained almost constant. Increases in the percentage of the
dye removal with biosorbent dosages could be attributed to
increases in the biosorbent surface areas, augmenting the number
of adsorption sites available for adsorption, as already reported in
several papers ( Lima et al., 2008; Royer et al., 2009b, 2010b;
Vaghetti et al., 2008, 2009 ). On the other hand, the increase in
the biosorbent doses promotes a remarkable decrease in the
amount of dye uptake per gram of adsorbent ( q), (Fig. 3 C and D),
an effect that can be mathematically explained by combining theEqs. (1) and (2):

As observed in the Eq. (5), the amount of dye uptaken ( q) and the
biosorbent dosage (X) is inversely proportional. For a ﬁxed dye
percentage removal (after doses of 2.5 g L/C01), the increase of bio-
sorbent doses leads to a decrease in qvalues, since the initial dye
concentration (C o) is always ﬁxed. These results clearly indicate
that the biosorbent dosages must be ﬁxed at 2.5 g L/C01, which is the
biosorbent dosage that corresponds to the minimum amount ofadsorbent that leads to constant dye removal. Biosorbent dosages
were therefore ﬁxed at 2.5 g L
/C01for both dyes.
3.4. Kinetic studies
Adsorption kinetic studies are important in the treatment of
aqueous ef ﬂuents because they provide valuable information on
the mechanism of the adsorption process ( Calvete et al., 2009,
2010; Vaghetti et al., 2009 ).
In attempting to describe the biosorption kinetics of RR-194 and
DB-53 dyes by CS biosorbent, four diffusion kinetic models weretested, as shown in Fig. 4 A and B (RR-194); 4C, 4F (DB-53). The
kinetic parameters for the kinetic models are listed in Table 3 . Based
on the F
errorvalues, it was observed that the Avrami model provides
the best ﬁt to the data for using RR-194 and DB-53 dye, because its
Ferrorvalues were at least 3.18 and 3.11 times lower, for RR-194 and
DB-53, respectively than the values obtained for pseudo- ﬁrst-order,
pseudo-second-order and Elovich-chemisorption kinetic models.
The lower the error function, the lower the difference of the q
calculated by the model from the experimentally measured q(Lima
et al., 2007, 2008; Calvete et al., 2009, 2010 ). It should be pointed
out that the F error utilized in this work takes into account the
number of the ﬁtted parameter (p term of Eq. (4)), since it is
reported in the literature ( Gunay, 2007 ) that depending on the
number of parameters one nonlinear equation presents, it has thebestﬁtting of the results ( Gunay, 2007 ). For this reason, the number
ofﬁtted parameter should be considered in the calculation of F
error.
Also, it was veri ﬁed that the qevalues found in the fractionary-order
were closer to the experimental qevalues, when compared with all
other kinetic models. These results indicate that the fractionary-
order kinetic model should explain the adsorption process of
RR-194 and DB-53 using CS biosorbent.The Avrami kinetic equation has been successfully employed to
explain several kinetic processes of different adsorbents andadsorbates ( Calvete et al., 2009, 2010; Cestari et al., 2005; Lopes
et al., 2003; Lima et al., 2008; Royer et al., 2009a, 2009b, 2010a,2010b; Vaghetti et al., 2009 ). The Avrami exponent ( n
AV) is a frac-
tionary number related with the possible changes of the adsorptionmechanism that takes place during the adsorption process ( Calvete
et al., 2009, 2010; Lima et al., 2008 ). Instead of following only an
integer-kinetic order, the mechanism adsorption could follow
multiple kinetic orders that are changed during the contact of the
adsorbate with the adsorbent ( Calvete et al., 2009, 2010; Lima et al.,
2008 ). The n
AVexponent is a resultant of the multiple kinetic order
of the adsorption procedure.
Since kinetic results ﬁt very well to the fractionary kinetic model
(Avrami model) for the RR-194 and DB-53 dyes using CS as bio-
sorbent ( Table 3 and Fig. 4 ), the intra-particle diffusion model
(Vaghetti et al., 2009 ) was used to verify the in ﬂuence of mass
transfer resistance on the binding of RR-194 and DB-53 dyes to the
biosorbent ( Table 3 and Fig. 4 C,D,G and H). The intra-particle
diffusion constant, k id(mg g/C01h/C00.5), can be obtained from the
slope of the plot of qt(uptaken at any time, mg g/C01) versus the
square root of time. Fig. 4 C and D (RR-194); 4G, 4H (DB-53) shows
the plots of qtversus t1/2, with multi-linearity for the RR-194 and
DB-53 dyes using CS biosorbent. These results imply that the
adsorption processes involve more than one single kinetic stage (or
adsorption rate) ( Vaghetti et al., 2009 ). For the DB-53 dye, the
adsorption process exhibits three stages, which can be attributed toeach linear portion of the Fig. 4 G and H. The ﬁrst linear portion was
attributed to the diffusional process of the dye to the CS biosorbentsurface ( Vaghetti et al., 2009 ); hence, it was the fastest sorption
stage. The second portion, ascribed to intra-particle diffusion, wasa delayed process. The third stage may be regarded as the diffusion
through smaller pores, which is followed by the establishment of
equilibrium. For RR-194 dye, the adsorption process exhibits only
two stages, being the ﬁrst linear part attributed to intra-particle
diffusion, and the second stage the diffusion through smaller pores,which is followed by the establishment of equilibrium ( Vaghetti
et al., 2009 ).
It was observed in Fig. 4 that the minimum contact time of RR-
194 and DB-53 with the CS biosorbent to reach equilibrium wasabout 8 and 18 h, respectively. This great difference in the
minimum contact time to reach the equilibrium is associated with
the difference in the mechanism of adsorption. The Avrami
constant rate ( k
AV) for RR-194 was 29.4% higher than the kAVfor DB-
53 dye, which implies that the diffusion from the ﬁlm could not
explain completely the remarkable differences on the kinetics of
adsorption of RR-194 in relation to DB-53. On the other hand, the
intra-particle diffusion constant ( kid) for RR-194 was more than 9-
fold higher than the kidfor DB-53, indicating that the resistance to
the mass transfer is much lower for RR-194 dye. This could explain
the difference of 10 h to reach the equilibrium for RR-194 in relation
to DB-53. Probably DB-53 molecules should be more aggregated,
forming dimers in aqueous solution, which would increase the
resistance to the mass transfer inside the porous of CS biosorbent
(Murakami, 2002 ).
In order to continue this work, the contact time between the
biosorbent and biosorbates was ﬁxed at 10.0 and 20.0 h using RR-
194 and DB-53 dyes as biosorbates, respectively and CS as bio-
sorbent to guarantee that for both dyes the equilibrium would be
attained even in higher biosorbate concentrations.
3.5. Equilibrium studies and mechanism of adsorption
An adsorption isotherm describes the relationship between
the amount of adsorbate taken up by the adsorbent ( qe) and theN.F. Cardoso et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 92 (2011) 1237 e1247 1242Fig. 4. Kinetic biosorption curves.

system attained the equilibrium (C e). There are several equations
to analyze experimental adsorption equilibrium data. The equa-tion parameters of these equilibrium models often provide someinsight into the adsorption mechanism, the surface properties
and af ﬁnity of the adsorbent. In this work, the Langmuir, the
Freundlich, the Sips and the Radke ePrausnitz isotherm models
were tested.
The isotherms of adsorption of RR-194 and DB-53 were
carried out at 298 K on the CS biosorbent, using the best exper-
imental conditions described previously ( Table 4 and Fig. 5 ).
Based on the F
error, the Sips model is the best isotherm model for
both dyes. The Sips model showed in Table 4 presents the lowest
Ferror values, which means that the qﬁtb yt h i si s o t h e r mm o d e l
was close to the qmeasured experimentally when compared
with other isotherm models. For RR-194 the Langmuir and theFreundlich isotherm models were not suitably ﬁtted, presenting
F
error values ranging from 3.37 to 26.0-fold higher than the F error
values obtained by the Sips isotherm model. For DB-53, the
Langmuir, the Freundlich and the Radke-Praunsnitz presented
Ferror values ranging from 12.1 to 41.1-fold higher than the F error
values obtained by the Sips isotherm model. Therefore, all thesemodels mentioned above for RR-194 and DB-53 dyes, using CS as
biosorbent, have no physical value. Only for RR-194, the Rad-
keePrausnitz presented a F
error value 1.58-fold higher than the
Ferror value obtained by the Sips isotherm model. Taking into
account that the Sips isotherm model presented the lowest F error
value for both dyes, this isotherm model was chosen as the best
for describing the equilibrium of adsorption of RR-194 and DB-53

model, the maximum amounts of RR-194 and DB-53 uptaken
were 64.1 and 37.5 mg g/C01for both dyes, respectively. These
values indicate that CS is a fair good biosorbent for the removal ofthese dyes from aqueous solutions.
It should be highlighted that the maximum amount adsorbed
of RR-194 by CS biosorbent was 70.9% higher than the value
obtained for the adsorption of DB-53. Considering that the kinetics
of adsorption of RR-194 was faster than the kinetics of adsorption
of DB-53 as well as considering the pH studies showed above, it is
possible to propose a mechanism of adsorption for RR-194 and
DB-53, which is depicted in Fig. 6 . In the ﬁrst step, the CS is
immersed in a solution with pH 2.0, being the functional groups(OH, carboxylates, please see Fig. 1 ) of the biosorbent protonated
(see Fig. 3 A and B). This step is fast for both dyes. The second step
is the separation of the agglomerates of dyes in the aqueous
solution. Dyes are in an organized state in the aqueous solution,
besides being hydrated ( Murakami, 2002 ). These self-associations
of dyes in aqueous solutions should be dissociated before thesedyes being adsorbed. Furthermore, the dyes should be dehydrated
before being adsorbed. For RR-194 dye, this step is relatively fast.On the other hand, this stage is relatively slower for DB-53
(Murakami, 2002 ). This explains the differences of the minimum
contact time for RR-194 and DB-53 to attain the equilibrium (seesection 3.4). The third stage is the electrostatic attraction of thenegatively charged dyes by the positively surface charged CSbiosorbent at pH 2 (see Fig. 1 ). This stage should be the rate
controlling step for RR-194. For DB-53, this is also the ratecontrolling step, however, the stage 2 presents some signi ﬁcance
to overall mechanism of adsorption.
4. Conclusion
The cupuassu shell (CS; T. grandiﬂ orum ) is a good alternative
biosorbent to remove C.I. Reactive Red 194 (RR-194) and C.I. Direct
Blue 53 (DB-53) textile dyes from aqueous solutions. The CS was
characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, SEM and nitrogen adsorption/
desorption curves. It was demonstrated that the OH groups of
phenols and alcohols and the carboxylate groups presented shift
to lower wavenumber after contact with both dyes, indicating that
these groups should participate of the biosorption mecha-
nism.Both dyes interact with the biosorbent at the solid/liquid
interface when suspended in water. The best conditions were
established with respect to pH and contact time to saturate the
available sites located on the adsorbent surface. Five kinetic
models were used to adjust the adsorption and the best ﬁt was the
Avrami (fractionary-order) kinetic model. However, the intra-
particle diffusion model gave multiple linear regions, which sug-
gested that the biosorption may also be followed by multiple
adsorption rates. The equilibration time for RR-194 and DB-53 dye
were obtained after 8 and 18 h, respectively of contact between
the dyes and the biosorbent. The equilibrium isotherm of these
dyes was obtained, being these data better ﬁtted to the Sips
isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacities were 64.1and 37.5 mg g
/C01for RR-194 and DB-53, respectively, using CS
biosorbent.
