1. ABSTRACT 
 
Over 50% of the adult population will use hair 
dyes at some point in their lifetimes. Hair dyes consist of 
various chemicals and the composition of these chemicals 
vary by hair dye types. Chemicals p-phenylenediamine and 
aminophenyl have been suggest ed as possible carcinogens 
or mutagens in experimental studies. The scientific 
community has been interested in this potential public 
health impact and the results of published epidemiological 
studies are summarized here. The current evidence provides 
limited evidences on the association between personal hair 
dye use and human cancer risk, except for the possibility of 
hematopoietic cancers and to a lesser extent, bladder cancer. 
Risk appears to be affected by time period of use and by 
specific genetic polymorphisms.   Future studies should 
investigate potential gene and environment interaction to 
assess possible genetic susceptibility. Several 
methodological issues should also be considered in future 
studies including completed hair dye use  information such 
as on timing, duration, frequency and type of hair dye 
product use.       
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
2. INTRODUCTION 
 
It is estimated that the hair-coloring product sales 
worldwide is about $12 billion per year and that up to 50% 
of the adult population of high-resource countries use hair 
colorants (1).  Hair-coloring products include permanent, 
semipermanent and temporary dyes that vary by chemical 
formulation and are distinguished mainly by how long they 
last and whether they penetrate the hair shaft.  Permanent 
dyes represent about 80% of the hair color market (1).  
Some compounds in hair dyes have been reported to be 
mutagenic or carcinogenic in bioassay systems (2). Many 
oxidative dye products were reformulated in the early 
1980s to eliminate ingredients that produced tumors in 
experimental bioassay studi es. Although it is unclear 
whether the current compounds  have carcinogenic effects 
or can affect overall immune response, 
paraphenylenediamine (PPD), a major arylamine currently 
used in most hair dyes, has been suggested as a putative 
carcinogen (3).  In addition, it has been found that many 
permanent hair dyes are contaminated with 4-Hair dye use and cancer 
517 aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), a recognized human carcinogen 
(4).  
 
During the past three de cades, the general public 
and the scientific community ha ve shown great interest in 
the potential health impact fro m personal use of hair dyes.  
Epidemiological studies have be en conducted to investigate 
the relationship between hair dye use and human cancer 
risk. The reported results, howev er, have been inconsistent 
and the relationship is varied by cancer type.  The purpose 
of this review is to summarize the current understanding of 
the relationship between persona l hair dye use and risk of 
human cancer by specific cancer types.  
 
3. BLADDER CANCER 
 
A total of 11 case-control studies (5-15) and three 
cohort studies (16-18) have investigated the relationship 
between personal hair dye use and risk of bladder cancer 
(Table 1).  These investigati ons assessing hair dye use and 
risk of bladder cancer have produced inconsistent results.  
Many of the studies involved small population sizes and/or 
incomplete hair dye usage information. 
 
One large population-based case-control study 
including 2,982 cases and 5,782 controls reported an increased 
risk of bladder cancer associated with ever using black hair dye 
product for both men and women (OR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.0,1.9) 
(8).  Another population-based case-control study involving 
897 cases and equal number of controls found a two-fold 
increased risk of bladder cancer among women who had used 
permanent hair dyes at least once a month, and the risk 
increased to 3.3-fold (95% CI: 1.3,8.4) for women who were 
regular (at least monthly) users for at least 15 years (15). The 
cohort studies generally reported no association between 
bladder cancer and hair dye use (16-20)  
 
Three meta-analysis studies have been published 
since 2005 assessing risk of bladder cancer and exposure to 
hair dyes (21-23). A study by Huncharek and Kupelnick (21), 
which had significant exclusio n criteria (which limited the 
meta-analysis to a mere seven st udies) and a unique weighted 
method of analyzing the data, suggested that there is a relative 
risk between 1.22 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.51) and 1.50 (95% CI: 1.30, 
1.98). Another two meta-analysis studies by Takkouche et al.  
(22) and Kelsh et al (23) found no association between bladder 
cancer and hair dye use. 
 
To date, very few studies have investigated whether 
genetic susceptibility modify the relationship between personal 
hair dye use and risk of bladder cancer. Gago-Dominguez et 
al. (15) examined permanent hair dyes and bladder cancer 
risk by N-acetyltransferas e-2 (NAT2) phenotype among 
female in the Los Angeles Bladder Cancer Study.  Among 
NAT2 slow acetylators, exclusive use of permanent hair 
dyes was associated with 2.7-fold increased risk of bladder 
cancer (95% CI: 1.0,7.2), and the risk appeared to increase 
with increasing duration and frequency of use of hair dye 
products.  Hair dye use was no t associated with bladder 
cancer risk among NAT2 fast acetylators (OR=1.1, 95%CI: 
0.4,2.7).  In 2003, Gago-Dominguez et al.  (3) also 
examined the effects of several other potential arylamine-metabolizing genotypes/phonetypes ( GATM1, GSTT1, 
GSTP1, CYP1A2 ).  The study found a 2.5-fold increased 
risk of bladder cancer associated with permanent hair dye 
use among women exhibiting CYP1A2 ‘slow’ phenotype 
but not among women exhibiting CYP1A2 ‘rapid’ 
phenotype.  No such modifyi ng effects were observed for 
GSTT1, GSTM1 , and GSTP1  genotypes. Another study 
reported no such increase in risk by any NAT1, NAT2, 
GSTM1, GSTM3, GSTP1, GSTT1, or CYP1A2  genotype 
(13). 
 
4. BREAST CANCER 
 
A total of 11 case-control studies (7, 24-34) and 
four cohort studies (16, 18-20, 35) have investigated the 
relationship between personal hair dye use and risk of 
breast cancer (Table 2). Nearly all of the studies have yet to 
suggest a conclusive no associ ation between breast cancer 
risk and exposure to hair dyes with the exception of one 
case-control study (34).   
  
No association between breast cancer and hair 
dye use was noted in most case-control studies (7, 24-26, 
28-33). When some of these studies estimat ed frequency, 
duration, or dose-response re lationships, no significant 
results exists for most studies. Moreover, several studies 
lacked information critical to performing some of these 
analyses (31, 34).  
 
When assessing for duration of use and type of 
hair dye use, positive associations sometimes were seen. In 
a study by Cook et al  (32), 2.5-fold (95% CI: 1.6, 3.9) 
increased risk was found among women who reported 
using any hair dye products after bleaching.  A significantly 
increased risk was also obs erved for women who reported 
using any rinse (OR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.5) and any frosting/tipping (OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.0) before 
applying hair dye products.  Among women who reported 
using two or more types of hair dye products, a 3.1-fold 
(95%CI: 1.6, 6.1) increased risk of breast cancer was 
observed for those used hair dyes for 90 or more total 
episodes during their lifetime. In the Zheng et al.  study (33) 
individuals using exclusively se mi-permanent types of hair 
coloring products, some ORs were elevated. Also, an 
increase in risk was noted for women who changed hair 
colors multiple times (28) 
 
The one study which suggested a strong 
association is the Petro-Nustas et al.  (34) case-control study 
in Jordan women. They reported that women who had ever 
used hair dye products experienced an 8.6-fold (95 CI: 3.3, 
22.3) increased risk of breast cancer compared to those who 
had never used hair dye products.  However, this study had 
several limitations, includi ng a convenience sample of 
controls, lack of detailed info rmation on hair dye use, and 
most importantly, is based on a very small sample size.

hese studies have varying conclusions, but the majority of 
case-control studies suggest a po tential for elevated risk of 
NHL with hair dye use and cohort studies are somewhat 
mixed. 
 
A pooled analysis by Zhang et al  (53), which 
included studies (38, 39, 41, 43, 44) that have collected 
detailed information on persona l hair dye use, noted a 
significantly increased risk of NHL in women who used 
hair dyes before 1980 (OR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.4).  
Analyses by NHL subtype showed increased risk 
associated with follicular lymphoma (OR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 
1.9) and chronic/small lym phocytic leukemia (CLL/SLL) 
(OR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) w ith a significant trend in risk 
with duration of use.  No association was observed for 
other NHL subtypes.  For women who began using the 
products in 1980 or after, an increased risk of follicular 
lymphoma was limited to users of dark-colored hair dyes 
(OR=1.5, 95%CI: 1.1,2.0).  The results indicate that 
personal hair dye use may play a role in the risk of 
follicular lymphoma and CLL/SLL in women who  started 
use before 1980 and that an in crease in risk of follicular 
lymphoma in women starting use in 1980 or after cannot be 
excluded.  The pooled analysis did not find an association 
among men. 
 
Several studies also investigated effect 
modifications of genetic va riation on the relationship 
between personal hair dye use and risk of NHL (39, 42, 48, 
51) Schroeder et al  (51) classified NHL by presence of 
t(14;18) translocation and found a significant  risk for hair 
dye use  in t(14;18)-negative translocation NHL (OR=2.1, 
95%CI: 1.3,3.4) but not in t(14;18)-positive translocation 
NHL (OR=1.8, 95%CI: 0.9,3.7) . Another study by Chiu et 
al (48), however, did not find an association by t(14;18) 
translocation in either men or women. 
 
Morton et al.  (39) examined the association by 
NAT1 and NAT2 genotype/phenotypes in a population-
based multi-center case-contro l study involving 1,321 cases 
and 1,057 controls.  They found an increased risk among 
women who used permanent inte nse tone hair dye products 
before 1980 if they had the rapid intermediate NAT2 
phenotype (OR=3.3, 95%CI: 1.3,8.6) or the NAT1 10 allele 
(OR=2.5, 95%CI: 0.9,7.6), but not if they were slow NAT2 
acetylators or had no copies  of the NAT1 10 allele.  NHL risk was not increased among women who began hair dye 
use after 1980 or among men.   
 
A population-based case-control study among 
Connecticut women was conducte d to test whether genetic 
variation in xenobiotic meta bolic pathway genes modifies 
the relationship between hair dye use and risk of NHL (42).  
No effect modifications were  found for women who started 
using hair dyes in 1980 or after.  For women who started 
before 1980 compared to neve r users, a significantly 
increased risk of NHL overall was found for carriers of 
CYP2C9  Ex3-52C>T   TT/CT genotypes (OR=2.9, 
95%CI:1.4,6.1), CYP2E1  -332T>A  AT/AA genotypes 
(OR=2.0, 95%CI:1.2,3.4), a homozygous or heterozygous 
3bp deletion in intron 6 of GSTM3  (OR=2.3, 
95%CI:1.3,4.1), GSTP1 Ex5-24A>G  AA genotypes 
(OR=1.8, 95%CI:1.1,2.9), or NAT2  genotypes conferring 
intermediate/rapid acetylator status (OR=1.6, 95%CI: 
1.0,2.7). The observed risks were strengthened and mainly 
observed for follicular lymphoma. In contrast, no 
significant increased risk was observed for hair dye users 
starting before 1980 relative to never users among women who were homozygous wild-type for the CYP2C9 , CYP2E1 , 
or GSTM3  polymorphisms, women carrying one or two 
copies of the variant GSTP1 allele, or women who were 
slow NAT2  acetylators.   
 
6. HODGKIN’S DISEASE 
 
Three case-control studies (40, 45, 50) and two 
cohort studies (20, 36) have investigated the relationship 
between hair dye use and risk of Hodgkin’s disease.  All of 
them have reported a non-significant inverse association 
except for one case-control study (40), which reported a 
three-fold increased risk of Hodgkin’s disease associated 
with permanent hair dye use. 
 
7. MULTIPLE MYELOMA 
 
Two case-control studies suggested an increased 
risk of multiple myeloma associated with personal hair dye 
use (40, 54), while four studies found no association (45, 
50, 55, 56)(Table 3). Brown reported a 1.9-fold increased 
risk of multiple myeloma among ever users based on 14 
exposed cases.  Zahm et al.  (40) found that users of Hair dye use and cancer 
524 permanent hair dyes had about 3-fold increased risk of 
multiple myeloma. 
 
The cohort studies provided inconsistent results 
linking hair dye use and risk of multiple myeloma (18-20, 36).  
Grodstein et al.  (36) reported a reduced risk of multiple 
myeloma associated with personal hair dye use.  Thun et al.  
(20) found a three-fold increased risk associated with dark 
permanent hair dye use.  Mendelsohn et al.  (18) noted no 
association between hair dye use and risk of multiple myeloma. 
 
8. LEUKEMIA 
 
Most studies suggested no association between 
leukemia risk and personal use of hair dyes (18, 20, 36, 50, 
57), , while others suggested an inverse association (58) or 
positive association (37, 59).  Study that examined the 
association by leukemia subtypes found no association with 
any subtype of leukemia (57). 
 
In studies with a positive association of hair dye use 
and risk of leukemia, there is a possibility for increasing risk 
with darker and/or permanent hair dyes and longer duration of 
use. Miligi et al.  (50) reported an increased risk of leukemia 
among women who reported using dark permanent hair dyes 
(OR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.1,3.8), although the study lacked 
information on time and duration of using hair dye products. 
Rauscher et al (59) reported an increased risk of leukemia 
associated with permanent hair dye use and the highest risk 
was found for women who used for 15 or more years up to six 
times per year of use. 
 
Caution is necessary interpreting the inverse 
association noted in the Bjork et al (58) study. Information on 
use of hair dyes were obtained by proxy interview in 81% of 
cases and 14% of controls and no information on type, color, frequency or duration of hair coloring products was collected. 
 
9. MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES 
 
Ido et al.  (60) conducted a hospital-based case-
control study in Japan from 1992-93 to investigate the risk 
factors for myelodysplastic syndromes. No information on 
type or color of hair dyes, frequency or duration of use was 
collected in this study.  A non-significant 2.5-fold increased 
risk (95% CI: 0.97, 6.41) was observed among women who 
had ever used hair dyes.   
    
A hospital-based case-control study in Japan in 
1995-96 investigated the association between hair dye use and 
risk of myelodysplastic syndromes (61).  Ever use of hair dyes 
was significantly associated with the risk of myelodysplastic 
syndromes in both men and women (OR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.2,3.4) 
and in women only (OR=2.9, 95% CI: 1.4,6.0).  The risks 
increased with increasing duration and number of hair dye uses.  
The study, however, provided no information on type or color 
of hair dye products used. 
 
10. CANCERS AT OTHER SITES   
 
A working group assessment by the Internal 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 1993 assessed the risk of cancers of the cervix (7), ovary (7), lung (7), 
kidney (7), brain (62), salivary gland (63), and malignant 
melanoma (64, 65).  Too few studies were available on 
those cancer sites to allow reviewers to make a conclusion 
whether personal hair dye use is associated with the risk of 
these cancer sites. More recently, however, a significant 
two-fold increased risk of ovarian cancer was observed 
for women who reported using hair dyes greater than 4 
times per year and the risk increased with increasing 
frequency of hair dye use (P=0.007) (66).   In one study 
of brain tumors, glioma risk was increased 1.7-fold (95% 
CI: 1.0, 2.9), and those who used permanent dye, a 2.4-
fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.3, 4.5) (67). However, a 
large portion of cases were proxy interviews. In another 
brain tumor study no consistent association with any 
brain tumors (glioma, me ningioma, and acoustic 
neuroma) was noted (68). Exposure assessment did not 
heavily rely on proxy interview as in the Heineman et al 
study (<18%)(67). 
 
11. CHILDHOOD CANCERS  
 
An investigation of Wilms Tumor risk, a 
childhood kidney tumor, was non-significantly increased 
with maternal use of hair dye products during pregnancy 
(OR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.7, 2.9) (69). Maternal use of hair dye 
products was not associated with the risk of childhood 
brain tumors in two studies (70, 71).  But one study on 
maternal use of hair dyes and the risk of neuroblastoma in 
children identified an increased risk (OR=1.6, 95% CI: 1.2, 
2.2) (72). 
 
12. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Epidemiological studies so far have provided 
limited evidence to support the hypothesis that personal 
use of hair dyes is associated with human cancer risk 
(73).  However, a possible association between certain 
type or color of hair dye products, such as permanent 
dark color hair dyes, and certain subtype of cancers, such 
as bladder cancer and hematopoietic neoplasms, cannot 
be ruled out.  Susceptible subgroups in the population 
may exist, such as certain functional polymorphisms in 
genes involved in arylamine activation or detoxification, 
which modify the association between hair dye use and 
human cancer risks.    
 
Hematopoietic cancers appear to have a 
possible elevated risk associated with hair dye use. The 
strongest association appears to be with non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma where various studies have estimated the risk 
of up to 100% and even as high as 230% elevated risk for 
specific subtypes of NHL. Out of a total of 17 studies, 12 
had significant results of elev ated risk of NHL with hair 
dye use, while five other studies had elevated risk, 
though not statistically significant. Increased risk of 
NHL may be subtype specific. In several studies, when 
assessed by subtype, follicular lymphoma and CLL/SLL 
subtypes were elevated. Due to the different etiologies of 
most NHL, future studie s should investigate NHL 
subtype and genetic polymorphisms in greater detail to 
better elucidate higher risk populations. Hair dye use and cancer 
525 While a relationship between hair dye exposure 
and human cancer risk is biolog ically plausible, the results 
from epidemiological studies assessing hair dye use to human 
cancer risks have been inconsistent for nearly all cancer sites 
investigated.  The major methodological challenge is exposure 
assessment.  In most studies, hair dyes were just one of many 
exposure variables on which information was collected.  In a 
few studies, only a few questions were asked to collect history 
regarding lifetime hair dye uses.  This limited scope of 
exposure assessment diminishes an adequate characterization 
of exposure in terms of type or color of hair dyes, frequency or 
duration of use, time period of use, age during each period of 
use. 
 
To further improve the value of epidemiologic 
research with regard to hair dye use will be an improvement in 
the methodology of both study design and exposure 
assessment. Prospective cohort studies have the importance of 
being able to several disease outcomes and to address temporal 
relationship. However, the published studies lacked complete 
information on timing, duration, frequency and type of hair 
dye product use, and this information is crucial to determining 
if intensity, total dose, type, and time period of hair dye use is 
most important in assessing risk.   
 
In conclusion, the current evidence do not support a 
significant association between hair dye use and human cancer 
risk, except for the possibility of hematopoietic cancers.  Given 
the complicated use patterns of hair dye products, the 
heterogeneity of many cancer sites, and the potential gene-
environmental interactions, well-designed, large population-
based studies could clarify the relationship between hair dyes 
and human cancer risks.  Based on several recent studies, this 
relationship appears to be affected by specific genetic 
polymorphisms and future studies should investigate potential 
gene and environment interact ion to assess possible genetic 
susceptibility.
