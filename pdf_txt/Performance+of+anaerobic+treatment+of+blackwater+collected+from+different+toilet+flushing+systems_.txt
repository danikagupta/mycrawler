New sanitation is developed based on wastewater source -diversion and on -site treatment to 
maximize resource recovery from domestic wastewater. Blackwater stream collected from toilets 
is rich in organics and nutrients, and the rest greywater stream contain s major water content. The 
primary objective of this thesis was to obtain high biomethane  recovery from blackwater using 
anaerobic digestion (AD) technology . Bioreactor operational performances accompanied the 
microbial community developments in various tr eatment conditions were demonstrated . The 
limitations in blackwater AD processes  were systematically revealed and resolved to help 
establish a high-rate blackwater treatment process . 
 
The research chain started from c haracteriz ing blackwater collected from  different types of toilet 
flushing systems to gain insights in the limiting factors in biomethane generation . Vacuum toilet 
blackwater (1 L water/flush) generated 29% lower biomethane production potential (BMP) than 
conventional and dual flush toilet blac kwater (9 L and 6 L water/flush) when treated at 35°C. 
The high free ammonia concentration of 393 mg/L in vacuum toilet blackwater was identified as 
the inhibition factor, and the methanogenesis process was found to be directly inhibited by free 
ammonia w hile the substrate hydrolysis and fermentation processes were not significantly 
affected.  
 
Continuous upflow anaerobic sludge blanket  (UASB) reactors  were operated at 35°C to treat  
different types of blackwater from water -conserving (vacuum) and water -wasting (conventional) 
toilets. Sulfate inhibition was observed in conventional toilet blackwater UASB treatment , which 
resulted in  a low methane production rate of 58.0 mL/L  reactor  /d. A high organic loading rate  iii (OLR) of 4.1 kg COD/m 3/d was obtained  in vacuum toilet blackwater UASB operation  through 
stepwise acclimatizing the system to increasing OLRs .  Methane production rate of 0.68 m3 CH 4/ 
m3 reactor/d  and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of 84% were obtained , 
representing t he highest blackwater treatment efficiency up to date . When the OLR  was further 
increased  to 4.9 kg COD/m 3/d, a 40% reduction in solid substrate hydrolysis was observed  due to 
sludge loss. Food waste and vacuum toilet blackwater co-digestion was then performed to 
resolve the substrate hydrolysis limitation . The maximum  OLR of 10 kg COD/m 3/d and methane 
production rate of 2.42 m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor/d  were obtained for blackwater and food waste co-
digestion process  using a UASB reactor, which was  attributed  to the enhanced bioreaction 
conditions with more favorable carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio and readily biodegradable substrates. 
The treatment performances  for blackwater and food waste co -digesti on in the current research 
represented the maximum bioenergy recovery efficacy from household biowaste  up to date .  
 
The 16S rRNA gene sequencing results revealed that d ifferent groups of bacteria and archaea 
were enriched with different blackwater sources  (conventional toilet blackwater or vacuum toilet 
blackwater with and without food waste addition) and changed OLRs  in UASB operation s. The 
combined syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic (HM) 
pathway  was established  in blackw ater treatment processes . Hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
dominated the archaeal communities  in all blackwater UASB operations . Methanogens from 
genus Methanospirillum  and Methanolinea  dominated in conventional toilet blackwater UASB 
reactor , and their abundance s shifted with different feed sulfate concentration s. Methanogens 
from genus Methanogenium  were predominant  in vacuum toilet blackwater mono -digestion 
system using the UASB reactor, and the dominant communities shifted to genus Methanoculleus   iv and uncultured genus from family Methanospirillaceae  in food waste co -digestion condition. 
SAO bacteria  groups , e.g. from order Clostridiales  were enriched in all blackwater treatment 
systems. The establishment of the SAO -HM methanogenic pathway in the vacuum toilet 
blackwater treatment system was associated with  the environmental factors of high ammonium 
concentration and/or  high OLRs.

1.1 Background and Motivations  
Wastewater treatment is critical in protecting  human and  aquatic environment from pollution. 
With the evolvement of technology and human habits, in the 19th and 20th century, the 
centralized sanitation system has been installed in cities for hygiene purposes. However , millions 
of people from less developed areas, e.g. Africa, are exposed to the risks from diarrhoeal  and 
other infectious diseases spread from polluted  water  due to the lack of sanitation . Even for 
developed countries where sanitation systems  are widely installed and maintained , pathogen ic 
risks  exist due to the improper sanitation pattern (Lens et al., 2015) . Further, the current 
sanitation system  consumes  a large amount of energy in the transportation and biological 
treatment processes accompanied by excess sludge generation, which makes it  vulnerable to the 
challenge of energy crisis rising from the  global  population increase  and fast urbanization . 
Approxim ate 84% of the energy consumption  in human society  is through fossil fuel 
combustion, and the large demand has been stressing the petroleum and natural gas industry and 
stimulating CO 2 emission  (Rittmann, 2015) . Facing such issues , a new sanitation  concept was 
brought up in recent decades , aiming at  reducing the environmental risks and enhancing resource 
recovery from wastewater  (Otterpohl and Oldenburg,  2007) . Comparing to the conventional  
sanitation  systems with  centralized sewage collection and treatment , the new sanitation system 
enabl es separate collect ion and treat ment of  the heavily polluted blackwater (toilet wastewater) 
from the other less pol luted  wastewater stream -greywater  at the household  level . As blackwater 
contains most pathogens and micropollutants (Lienert et al., 2007) , half the load of the organic  
materials , and most  of the total nitrogen and phosphorus  (De Graaff et al., 2011)  in the total 
household  wastewater , but only accounts for  a small fraction of the total wastewater volume , a 
lower level of pathogenic risk , and bioenergy and nutrients (nitrogen & phosphorus)  recovery 
can be achieved  from treating blackwater . Water re -use can be simultaneously achieved  through 
treating the greywater which contains large quantities of water.   
 
In the new sanitation design, bioenergy recovery from the source -diverted blackwater  serves as 
one of the  core component s ensuring  the overall process sustainability.  A simple and effective  2 approach to recover the bioenergy is through anaerobic digestion (AD)  which can convert  
organic  pollutants  into biogas  with the help of anaerobic microorganisms at low operational cost. 
In traditional sanitation system, a naerobic treatment  has been utilized  in treating conventional 
combined sewage, especially in  the tropical area due to its strong dependence on temperature ; 
intensive research have also been conducted  on enhancing the treatment performance s under low 
temperature s in the recent years  (Zhang et al., 2018) .  As the anaerobic treatment process favors 
organic -rich substrates, it is economically more beneficial  to directly apply anaerobic digestion 
in the decentralized sanitation system  where black water  serves as the bioenergy resource. 
However, due to the limited blackwater collection sites, only a few studies  about blackwater 
anaerobic digestion have been reported  in the recent twenty years , and with various blackwater 
collection sources and different operation al systems  and conditions  applied, the treatment 
performances  varied  significantly in these  reported studies . Relatively low organic loading rates 
(OLR) with low methane generation  have been observed in m ost of the se systems , but research 
questions about the optimal operational conditions for achieving high-rate blackwater treatment  
and the limiting  factors  for obtaining  effective biomethane recovery remain un addressed . 
Further, insightful information such as  the functional microbial community involved in the 
blackwater anaerobic  treatment process es have never been reported .  
 
1.2 Research Objective  
The overall objective s of this research w ere to maximize biomethane recovery from blackwater 
anaerobic treatment process and to illustrate  insightful information on process limitations and 
optimization strategies as well as the accompanied microbial community development . The 
specific objectives include : 
 
1) Evaluate  characteristics of blackwater collected from different types of toilet s and identify  the 
critical limiting factors on biomethane production.   
2) Investigate process limitations  in continuous blackwater treatment processes using upflow 
anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors .  
3) Mitigate blackwater treatment limitations towards e nhanc ing organic loading rate with high 
biomethane production.    3 4) Reveal the microbial community development and identify the feasible methanogenic 
pathways in blackwater treatment system . 
 
1.3 Research Approach  
The researc h objectives have been approach ed in the following ways:   
 
1) Evaluation  of source -diverted blackwater  from different toilet flushing systems  
Variations in toilet flushing system can result in significant difference s in blackwater volume and 
chemical properties. Different toilet s that are currently widely utilized were selected for 
blackwater characterization , including conventional, dual flush and vacuum flush toilets . The 
biomethane potential (BMP) test was perform ed to evaluate the maximum methane yield . The 
inhibition factor that limited the biomethane yield of vacuum toilet blackwater was verified  
through toxic ity assays .  
 
2) Blackwater UASB treatment  
The current research selected UASB reactor s to demonstrate continuous blackwater treatment  
because  UASB  enable s a long solids retention time (SRT) with a short hydraulic retention time 
(HRT) , which potential ly enables  high OLRs . Optimization strategies against the free ammonia 
inhibition (identified fr om the BMP test) were applied for treating vacuum toilet blackwater , 
including pH control and microbial acclimatization . Impacts from influent sulfate on the 
biomethane yield of conventional toilet blackwater was evaluated  through changing toilet 
flushing water  from tap water to DI water in the UASB operation . The OLR was challenged in 
the UASB reactor treating vacuum toilet blackwater. Process limitations under the overloaded  
condition was illustrated by investigating hydrolysis and methanogenesis processe s.   
 
3) Blackwater and food waste anaerobic co -digestion using a UASB reactor  
This section followed the previous vacuum toilet blackwater UASB treatment, which aims to 
help resolve the hydrolysis limitation in the blackwater mono -digestion system at the h igh 
organic loading condition. Food waste contains readily biodegradable organics that can 
potentially help enhance microbial activities, and with high carbon but low nitrogen contents of 
food waste, their addition can help balance the carbon to nitrogen ( C/N) ratio of the feedstock. 4The UASB reactor was operated to demonstrate its  feasibility of treating blackwater and food 
waste co -substrates. The OLR  was gradually challenged to demonstrate the threshold of the 
UASB  treatment capacity for household biowaste.   
 
4) Reveal methanogenic pathways in blackwater anaerobic treatment processes  
An effective methanogenic pathway play s the key role in extracting  bioenergy from organic 
pollutants in blackwater. The current research evaluated the development of the methanogenic 
pathway through approaches of specific methanogenic activity (SMA) tests, carbon isotopic 
signatures analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These approaches were applied to different treatment/operational conditions of i) differen t treated feedstocks, i.e. blackwater collected from 
conventional and  vacuum toilets , and vacuum toilet blackwater with food waste; ii) different 
bioreactor operational mode, i.e. in batch reactors and continuous UASB reactors; iii) different 
bioreactor operational conditions, i.e. different organic loading rates ; iv) conventional toilet 
blackwater  with different types of t oilet flushing water . The interactions between 
hydrolytic/fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea were interpreted. The  dynamic shifts 
of microbial communities  and the establishment of methanogenic pathway were correlated with 
blackwater treatment p erformances.

  8 CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW  
 
2.1 New sanitation towards sustainable development  
“Sustainable development ” was defined  as “development that meets the needs of the present 
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs ” 
(Report of the World Commission on Environment a nd Development: Our Common Future [The 
Brundtland Report ], 1987) . A sustainable  system can adapt  to changing environment and  be 
resilient in accommodat ing local circumstances . Due to  the fast city expansion and 
industrialization, p ollutions and resource scarcity have become  the primary challenges to a 
sustainable future . To tackle the se challenges , recovery and reuse of resources in terms of water, 
energy and nutrients have become the urgent necessity for the current society .  
 
The conventional centralized sanitation systems have been developed to meet the needs of 
human hygiene, yet this design lacks sustainability  due to the energy and water consumption and 
the large footprint  requirement . In recent decades, a new sanitation concep t of “decentralized 
sanitation and reuse”  has been brought up to meet the  sustainable  goal. This new sanitation 
system  exhibits benefits towards sustainability from  perspectives of economics, energy, 
ecological, social -cultural and human health impact  comp ared with the conventional sanitation 
system . The major benefits are discussed as following:   
 
Economic  cost 
The conventional centralized sanitation  pattern  is costly due to  the maintenance and operational 
expenses of the city-wide wastewater conveyance network s and the large -scale wastewater 
treatment plants  (WWTP) . While the decentralized sanitation system  can reduce the  cost with the 
short  pipework for small -scale systems  and the replacement of the conventional energy -intensive 
aeration process . The investment costs  for the new sanitation pattern were  estimated to be 640-
2,170 US$/capita for the sewer disconnected cases, and 260 -680 US$/capita for the sewer 
retained new sanitati on scenarios , assuming that the new sanitation system can only replace the 
conventional scenario at similar costs to the current centralized system (2,600 -2,800 US$/capita)  
(Maurer et al., 2005) .    9 Resource recovery and reuse  
In spite of the reliability in securing environmental and hu man health protections, the 
conventional centralized collection mixed different wastewater streams  and diluted the pathogens 
and toxicants in a large water volume, resulting in high space and energy input along with 
emissions throughout the treatment proce sses. Resource recovery is difficult from sewage. The 
new sanitation system offers to maximize resource recovery from household wastewater  through  
wastewater source diversion and on -site treatment approaches  (Fig. 2.1) . Bioenergy and nutrients 
can be recov ered from treating the organic and nutrient -rich blackwater stream collected from 
toilets . The rest less polluted greywater from handwashing, shower, laundry can be treated  for 
water re -use. This design enables  closing the water, nutrients and energy cycle  at the household  
level (Kujawa -Roeleveld et al., 2006) . The recovered bioenergy can be utilized to heat  up the 
treatment facilities and neighborhood communities. The t reated water  can potential ly be utilized 
for toilet flushing , gardening  and floor cleaning , and the recovered nutrients  can be utilized as 
fertilizers  for crops . 
 
Ecological impact   
The large -scale centralized wastewater coll ection and transportation networks are posing risks at 
a wider range in the spread of pathogens and micropollutants (hormones and pharmaceutical 
residues) when system failure occurs, while the decentralized system controls risks within a 
small scale.  Furth er, the design of on -site treatment and reuse minimizes the effluent discharge 
into the waterbodies, which helps reduce cumulative impacts to aquatic environment  (Fane and 
Fane, 2005) .  
 
In addition  to the descriptions above , the impact on human health from pathogens can be lower 
(Fane et al., 2002)  and social interactions can be enhanced with greater community involvement 
in the local treatment sys tems  compared with the conventional centralized sanitation .  10 
Fig. 2.1. Scheme of the decentralized sanitation and re -use system . 
 
2.2 Blackwater  
The current research work is mainly concerned with  the treatment of source- diverted blackwater. 
The separate collection and treatment of blackwater  at the local level  provides benefits of i) 
minimize the spread of hazardous materials: pathogens, pharmaceutical residues, hormones from 
human excreta to the water cycles; ii) produce biogas to support local energy consumption, either 
for the treatment plants themselves or for residential utilization; iii) produce nutrient-rich effluent 
which can be applied as fertilizers after proper post- treatment for pathogenic removal; iv) reduce 
water  consumption with the implementation of water -conserving toilet flushing systems.  
 
2.2.1 Variance in blackwater sources  
Blackwater characteristics can be affected by different factors. The human diet is one major 
aspect that could generally be affected by local economics, traditions, eating habits, and ages . 
For instance, it has been reported that fecal wet weights from low- income countries were twice 
those from high- income countries due to the higher fiber intake in the local population (Rose et 
al., 2015) . The collection site/area from either work or at home also contributes to the variance in 
blackwater chemical properties. The different types of toilet flushing system is another key 
influencing factor to the blackwater characteristics in terms of both volume and chemical 
properties. Toilets in the current market can be separated based on their water consumption 
amounts.  Water -conserving toilets  such as vacuum toilets  consume only 0.5–1.2 L water per 
flush and produce 5–7 L of blackwater per person per day, whereas water -wasting toilets such as 
conventional toilets use 5 –9 L (up to 12 L) water per flush and produce 6– 15 times more 
blackwater in  volume (Elmitwalli et al., 2006; Moges et al., 2018; Zeeman et al., 2008) . So far, Blackwater

and listed in Table 2.1.  Despite the different collection area s, the reported blackwater studies can 
be categorized based on the types of toilet flushing systems, either with vacuum toilets or 
conventional toilets.  
 
Due to its lower  dilution, blackwater collected from vacuum  toilets includes relatively rich 
organics a nd nutrients contents with the chemical oxygen demand  (COD ) concentration s ranging 
from 5,500  (±1,300 ) mg/L to 15,500  (±3,300 ) mg/L . Conventional  toilets, however, exhibited 
lower COD values ranging from 932 (±244 ) mg/L to 2,887  (±793 ) mg/L . Overall, the reported 
pH values were  at the range of 7.4 -9.0. The ammonium nitrogen (NH 4+-N) contents vary with the 
water amounts, which showed the high range of 499 -1,400  mg/L for concentrated blackwater 
and the low range of 54 -202 mg/L for the less concentrated type o f blackwater (De Graaff et al., 
2010; Gallagher and Sharvelle, 2010; Knerr et al., 2011; Zamalloa et al., 2013) .

Different types of sustainable treatment options have been researched for blackwater treatment. 
For instance, composting, which can generate biofertilizers from blackwater, has been tested 
(Oarga Mulec et al., 2016) . Despite its obvious advantages of the overall low treatment cost, 
effective pathogen removal, and ec onomic end products’ generation, its treatment efficiency and 
practical application are limited by the factors of long retention time, aeration control, proper 
selection of the composting bulk additi ves due to the low carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of 
blackwater (Hashemi et al., 2019) . A blackwater treatment process using membrane bioreactor 
(MBR) has been demonstrated at a semi -technical scale to obtain high effluent water quality 
(Knerr et al., 2011) . In a single house demonstration case in Brazil, a maint enance -free 
evapotranspiration tank has been tested possible for blackwater management (Paulo et al., 2013) . 
A hybrid process with granular activated carbon (GAC) filter and electrochemical treatment has 
been demonstrated for the  on-site reuse and/or discharge of blackwater  (Rogers et al., 2018) . 
Microwave  treatment  has been te sted as an effective method in rapidly reducing blackwater 
volume and pathogens , which makes it promising in emergency situations (Mawioo et al., 2016) . 
The feasibility of applying “Microbial Fuel Cell ( MFC)” on blackwater treatment for power 
generation ha s also been evaluated (Fangzhou et al., 2011; Vogl et al., 2016) . Among the 
reported blackwater treatment technologies, anaerobic digestion is one of the most promising 
approach es for practical  application. This technology  enables  on-site bioenergy recovery from 
blackwater  with low maintenance requirements, which was sup erior cost -effective ness. 
    
2.3 Anaerobic digestion  
After its discover y in the 10 th century, anaerobic digestion technology has been widely utilized 
in wastewater treatment. Compared with the biological aerobic treatment processes, the premium 
advantages of anaerobic processes include the energy generation in the form of biogas, low 
sludge production, and small footprint. Due to the global energy deficiency and climate change 
in the past decades, increasing research interests have been put in anaerobic digestion towards 
deeper comprehension of the reactor design, reaction mechanisms, and process limitations.  
  13 2.3.1 Process description  
The overall anaerobic digestion process is a biological treatment process carried out by a group 
of microorganisms that converts organics into biogas under  anaerobic condition . Wastewater 
usually contains complex organic matters comprised of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. To be 
converted into biogas, the organics would go through the following four reaction steps:  
A. Hydrolysis: acidogenic bacteria excrete enzymes for biopolymers solubili zation, the  products 
are monomers and dimers  such as sugars, amino acids, and long -chain fatty acids ; 
B. Acidogenesis: soluble organics are converted to volatile fatty acids (VFA) , alcohol,  and 
carbon  dioxide (CO 2);  
C. Acetogenesis: alcohol and VFAs are c onverted to acetate and hydrogen (H 2) and CO 2; 
D. Methanogenesis: acetate and H 2&CO 2 are converted to CH 4. 
 
2.3.2 Reactor types  
A proper selection of reactor configuration determines the success of the treatment process. 
Parameters of hydraulic retention t ime (HRT) and sludge retention time (SRT) are critical for 
configuration designs. High SRTs are preferable for process stability and low HRTs enable small 
reactor volumes. The so -far developed anaerobic bioreactors can be categorized as with or 
without bio mass retention. The reactor type without biomass retention, such as continuous stirred 
tank reactor (CSTR), provides equal HRT and SRT and these reactors are generally utilized 
under low volumetric organic loading rates conditions with relatively long HRT/ SRT. The type 
of reactors with sludge retention, such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), can offer an 
extensively longer SRT than HRT. The selection of reactor type is correlated with wastewater 
properties. In general, bioreactors with equal SRT an d HRT tend to be applied in treating high 
solids types of waste/wastewater (Li et al., 2011) , e.g. waste activated sludge, while bioreactors 
with SRT>HRT are usually applied for wastewater with low solids content.  
 
Batch bioreactors  
Batch reactors are easy to operate. These reactors are operated with a single time fed inoculum 
and feedstock and are emptied once the reaction completed. With better flexibility of controlling 
the operational parameters compared to the continuous mode bio reactors, the bench -scale batch  14 systems are widely applied to test the microbial responses towards the different types of 
feedstocks, changed environmental factors and toxicants/inhibitors  (Hosseini, 2019) .   
 
Continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR)  
CSTR reactors are the very first generation of anaerobic bioreactors that applied in municipal 
sewage treatment. The system is completely mixed, and the constant feeding and discharging 
happen continuously. HRTs of 15 -30 days are usually applied for CSTR reactors and the organic 
loading rates are normally within 4 kg COD/m 3/day (Metcalf and Eddy,  2003) . Although such 
systems have advantages of simple control/operation and homogenous contact between microbes 
and organics, there are clear drawbacks such as the large reactor installation footprint due to the 
long HRT/SRT.      
 
Upflow anaerobic sl udge blanket (UASB)  
The sludge retention is critical for obtaining a high -rate wastewater treatment process. With a 
deeper understanding of the importance of sludge retention, anaerobic bioreactor designs have 
been modified. A typical high -rate bioreactor type UASB, and its variant and modified reactor 
types including expanded granular sludge blanket (EGSB), internal circulation UASB (IC), 
anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) have been utilized for high -rate wastewater treatment (Metcalf 
and Eddy, 2003) .  
 
Developed in the 1960s in the Netherlands, t he upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor 
was designed based on the concept  of biomass retention (Lettinga et al., 1980) . In a UASB 
reactor, wastewater is fed from the bottom of the reactor, evenly distributed and flow upwards 
through a sludge bed. B iomass retention can be accomplished by the sludge aggregates  settling 
and the gas/liquid/sludge separation system in the reactors.  The microbes in the sludge bed can 
entrap the suspended organics from the wastewater stream and convert the o rganics into biogas, 
which results in high biodegradation rates (Speece, 1983) . UASB reactors have been widely 
applied to treat industrial wastewater, dairy wastewater,  domestic sewage , and agricultural waste  
(Lettinga and Hulshoff Pol, 1991) . The effect s from  temperature, OLR, and sludge granulation  
are of great importance in the operation of UASB reactors.  
  15 2.3.3 Limiting factors  
It is important for each of the anaerobic  reaction  steps to work in a balanced state to maintain a 
stable anaerobic  digestion process.  Limitations in anaerobic digestion proces s correlate with both 
feedstock characteristics and treatment conditions. The predominant drawbacks of anaerobic 
digestion technology include i) the process slow start -up due to the slow growth rate of 
methanogens; ii) the strong dependence on temperature,  e.g. hydrolysis of solid organics can be 
limited under cold climate; iii) the probable instability caused by methanogenesis inhibition, e.g. 
from toxicants such as high free ammonia (FA) and long -chain fatty acids (LCFA). Besides, the 
post-treatment proce sses are usually required to meet the effluent discharge limits, and the 
odorous problem might need to be encountered when treating sulfate -containing or protein -rich 
wastewater due to sulfide generation.  
 
Temperature   
Anaerobic digestion can be conducted under all three temperature ranges of psychrophilic (10 -
20 °C), mesophilic (20 -40 °C) and thermophilic (50 -60 °C). Low -temperature operation is 
generally not favorable. The microbial growth rate and substrate utilization rate are low under 
such c onditions. The gas solubility is higher under low er temperature s, which may result in 
inhibitory effects, for instance, higher H 2S content can be toxic to microbes (Lettinga et al., 
2001) . It is even more difficult to treat complex wastewater steams under low -temperature 
conditions, and a long solids retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) are 
usually required for hydrolyzing solid organics. For instance, a longer SRT of 75 days was 
required for sufficient hydrolysis and methanogenesis to happen when treating sewage at 15 °C 
compared with the SRT of 15 days under 25 °C (Miron et al., 2000; Zeeman and Lettinga, 1999) . 
Compared with the psychrophilic condition, the thermophilic condition promotes  microbial 
growth rate, solid organics hydrolysis rate and the substrate utilization rate, which typically 
results in smaller bioreactor footprints and shorte r treatment time (Ruffino et al., 2015) . Such 
advant ages make this temperature condition superior to treat high -solid substrates, and the 
generally considered countereffect from high heating cost only plays a smaller role as compared 
to the benefits (Harzevili and Hiligsmann, 2017) . Further, the high -temperature condition can 
help with pathogen removal. One disadvantage of the thermophilic condition is that the microbes 
are more sensitive towards the environmental parameters , process failures occurred when facing  16 VFAs accumulation/pH drop or the toxicant s such as high free ammonia concentration (Chen et 
al., 2008) . Compared with the above two conditions, bioreactors operated at mesophilic 
temperatures are widely applied because of their relatively high treatment efficiencies and 
stability.   
 
pH 
Among the several steps in the anaerobic digestion process, the final methanogenesis step for gas 
production favors a narrow pH range of 6.8 -7.2, while the acid production phases favor more 
acidic pH ranging at 5.2 -6.3 (Rajeshwari et al., 2000) . To avoid the methanogenic inhibition, a 
pH level over 6.5 and alka linity concentration over 1,000 mg CaCO 3/L are generally 
recommended (Tchobanoglous et al., 2003) . pH adj ustments are usually required for treating 
acidic wastewater streams, such as wastewater from fermentation industries with a pH range of 
4.5-5.5 (Khanal et al., 2017) . The im pact of pH largely depends on the feedstock characteristics 
and the limiting steps. When the methanogenesis step could not catch up with the rate of 
substrates’ acidification, the accumulated VFAs could probably result in a pH drop below 6, 
which can be ha rmful to methanogens. This type of effect can be observed when treating fast -
acidified substrates such as food waste under high a loading state with insufficient alkalinity (Xu 
et al., 2018) . In addition to the direct impact on microorganisms, pH level also governs the 
ionization  state of some typical inhibitors in the anaerobic digestion process, where high pH 
value can contribute to the higher formation of free ammonia (FA) (Borja et al., 1996)  and low 
pH value can lead  to increasing fractions of unionized sulfide products i.e. H 2S (Khanal et al., 
2017) , and both of these unionized molecules have been considered as toxic agents to 
microorga nisms, especially methanogens.      
 
Organic loading rate  
The organic loading rate represents the capability of an anaerobic bioreactor treating certain 
types of waste/wastewater, and high OLRs are preferable due to the low capital cost (low 
bioreactor volume). The maximum applicable OLRs are dependent on the reactor type, 
operational conditions, and substrates properties. For instance, high -rate bioreactors with sludge 
bed, e.g. expanded granular sludge blanket (EGSB) can tolerate high loadin gs up to 35 kg 
COD/m 3/day, while the low -rate types of reactors, e.g. anaerobic lagoon may not exceed 2 kg  17 COD/m 3/day (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003) . Stable biogas generation and effluent q uality can 
generally be obtained within the threshold OLRs. The overloaded condition can occur when the 
rates of methanogenesis and hydrolysis -fermentation processes could not match. VFA 
accumulation would happen when the fermentation rate is faster, which  could result in a sour 
system and even process failure (Ferguson et al., 2016) . When the rate of solid organics 
hydrolysis could not satisfy the methanogenesis rate, the methane yield would decrease; this 
typically happens when the active biomass ge ts lost under an overloaded state in the systems 
handling high solid fraction organic materials.  
 
Toxicants/inhibitors  
The toxic substances can be introduced from the waste/wastewater (e.g. heavy metals) streams or 
be produced during the anaerobic digestio n processes (e.g. H 2S). 
 
Ammonium is important to anaerobic digestion process as it can provide buffer capacity and be 
utilized by microbes as a nitrogen source. However, e xcess ammon ium content  has been 
commonly reported to inhibit methane production process, and the f ree ammonia (FA) has been 
considered as the major toxicants.  The level of FA can be determined by total ammoni um 
concentration (TAN), pH and temperature. Compared with the ionized ammonium, FA  can 
diffuse into the cells and cause the proton i mbalance. The FA inhibition effect generally acts on 
methanogens (Angelidaki and Ahring, 1993; Koster and Lettinga, 1984) . Various FA inhibitory 
concentrations have been reported in different AD systems. The concentration s ranged from 55 -
80 mg  FA/L (fed with acetate/propionate) to up to 1,600 -2,600 mg  FA/L (fed  with swine 
manure) ha ve been found generated inhibitory effects (Rajagopal et al., 2013; Yenigün and 
Demirel, 2013) . The strategies  of pH  control , feedsto ck dilution , co-digestion,  and microbial 
communities ’ acclimatization can be applied  to mitigate ammonia  inhibition.  
 
Sulfate and sulfide (typically H 2S) inhibition s are commonly reported in AD systems. Excess 
sulfate contents are commonly found in industr ial wastewater streams, such as from molasses 
fermentation, acid mine drainage, food processing industries, and domestic wastewater 
(Liamleam and Annachhatre, 2007) . Their impacts on the biogas production processes are 
mainly from i) the competition of electron donors between sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and  18 other anaerobes (e.g. fermentative bacteria and methanogens), and ii) the toxic effects from H2S 
generated during the react ions. SRB can utilize various types of electron donors including 
hydrogen, short -chain and long -chain fatty acids, alcohols, and other organics such as aromatic 
compounds (J.W.H. et al., 1994) , which makes them competitive against multiple stages in the 
anaerobic digestion process, yet research efforts were mostly put into the methanogenesis stage. 
With the thermodynamic favorability and high H 2 affinity to SRB (Laanbroek et al., 1984) , it is 
generally believed that H 2 utilizing SRB can outcompete hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
(O’Flaherty et al., 1999) . Due to the variances in the chemical properties of substrates and the 
operational conditions, different inhibitory threshold levels and results were reported. For 
instance, the inhibitory threshold of H 2S varied in the reported studies with a level of 
approximately 50 -400 mg/L unionized H 2S (Parkin et al., 1990) . Factors such as the substrates’ 
COD/sulfate ratio, the microbial community structures and the amount of produced unionized 
H2S have been the main focus in sulfate competition studies. A low COD/sulfa te ratio has been 
generally considered as generating inhibition effects on the methane yield, while contradictory 
results were reported that the COD/sulfate ratio did not affect methane yield or microbial 
diversity (Cetecioglu et al., 2019 ; Kiyuna et al., 2017) .  
   
Other inhibitors/toxicants including  heavy metals, long -chain fatty acids  and toxic organics  have 
all been  reported in anaerobic digestion processes (Chen et al., 2008).  
 
2.4 Anaerobic treatment of source -diverted blackwater   
2.4.1 Blackwater anaerobic treatment studies reported in literature  
Only limited studies have been conducted in blackwater anaerobic treatment so far, and the 
reported research are mostly  focused on demonstrating process feasibility. Various reactor types 
and operational conditions including temperatures and OLRs have been  applied in these work. 
Table 2 .2 lists the literature reported treatment performance s regarding the COD removal 
efficienc ies and methane yield s.  
 
The treatment performance in the reported work differed significantly upon the variances in the 
reactor type and the operational temperature. In terms of reactor type, a ccumulation system (AC) 
(not provided in Table 2.2) has been applied for vacuum toilet  blackwater treatment at 20 °C  and  19 achieved 80% of COD removal and 58% of  methanisation (Kujawa -Roeleveld et al., 2006) . 
Although the AC system could provide a  relatively high COD removal efficiency and 
methanisation,  a large reactor volume  of 1,000 L and long HRT/SRT of 150 days were required 
for sufficient treatment in the above  study. This “Load -empty” type of system can be used when 
considering the direct application of  the digested effluent (with optional hyg iene) for 
irrigation/f ertilization (Kujawa -Roeleveld et al., 2006) . CSTR  treatment for  vacuum toilet  
blackwater at 37 °C obtained a COD removal of 61% and  meth ane production of 0.24 m 3 CH 4/kg 
COD added (Wendland e t al., 2007) . Performance of such systems with no sludge retention was 
found  to be poorer than  those reactors with sludge bed  in the system. Overall, UASB and UASB -
septic tank systems generated higher COD  removal efficienc ies and methane production 
comp ared to the other types of treatment systems.  A high COD removal efficiency of 85% was 
achieved in a septic tank (Zamalloa et al., 2013) . As for the applied temperature , the  
demonstrated research  in Table 2.2  were performed in a temperature  range  of 15-37 °C. It is 
observed that for the same type of reactor using UASB -septic tank with the same blackwater 
source p rovided, the COD removal efficiency increased from 61% to 78%  and the methane yield 
increased from 1.3 m 3 CH 4/ m 3 BW to 2.0 m 3 CH 4/ m 3 BW when  the temperature  was increased 
from 15 °C to 25 °C (Kujawa -Roeleveld et al., 2006) .  
 
Despite the variances of the treatment performances, it is noticed that the reported studies were 
operated under relative ly low OLRs of 0.27 -2.3 kg COD/m 3/day. For the conventional toilet  
blackwater, the highest  OLR of ~2.3 kg COD/m 3/day was found in a UASB reactor operation , 
and it obtained an  overall  COD removal efficiency of 91% (UASB  + membrane) and methane 
yield  of 0.27 g CH 4-COD/g influent  COD (van Voorthuizen et al., 2008) . For a vacuum toilet  
blackwater  (COD 5,500 mg/L ) study , a similar high OLR of 2.3 kg COD/m 3/day was obtained  in 
a sludge blanket anaerobic baffled react or, and a 78% COD removal and 0.69 -0.73 g CH 4-
COD/g influent COD methane production were achieved (Moges et al., 2018) . For  a mo re 
concentrated type vacuum toilet blackwater (COD ~10,000 mg/L), the maximum OLR reached 
1.4 kg COD/m 3/day, and a  78% COD removal and 0.57 g CH 4-COD/g feed COD of methane 
production  were obtained  (Zeeman et al., 2008) . The blackwater properties, reactor types and the 
treatment conditions can all constrain the applied OLRs in the blackwater AD system. 
Considering blackwater contains a high solid  organic  COD fraction, the substrate hydrolysis may  20 be a limiting factor. Although the hydrolysis might be promoted with an elevated temperature, 
the high ammonium concentration from urine and high pH value can contribute to a high  free 
ammonia concentration  and result in ammoni a inhibition . Regarding the probable limitations in 
blackwater AD processes, the optimal process design for the selection of bioreactor 
configuration, operational temperature, and OLRs  requires further systematic investigations.

2.4.2 New sanitation system case study  
Pilot and full -scale demonstrations of the decentralized sanitation system are being developed 
worldwide, i.e. in Europe, the United States, Asia and Africa (Nansubuga et al., 2016) .   
 
Sneek, The Netherlands  
The Netherlands has been pioneering the development of new sanitation system s. Starting from 
the year 2000 in Waterland, Groningen, several demonstration projects based on the concept of 
“separation at the source” have been developed in the Net herlands (Reinhard and Folmer, 2011) . 
In 2006, a 32 house demonstration project was developed in Sneek, Friesland. Vacuum toilets 
utilizing 1 L flushing water per flush were installed, and the blackwater anaerobic treatmen t has 
been conducted in two UASB -septic tank systems (200 L each) and a UASB reactor (50 L). 
Project scale -up was realized in 2011 when the project including 250 houses in Waterschoon was  21 started. In this demonstration, around 12% of the gas demand of the district for house and tap 
water heating is covered by blackwater digestion (Waterschoon, 2020) . A 500 -houses project is 
under construction in Amsterdam.  
 
Hamburg, Germany  
The concept of “Hamburg Water Cycle” was developed  in Hamburg, which aims at installing  the 
source -separation sanitation system to combine the wastewater treatment and the energy 
recovery and supply at the residential level. After demonstrating the small -scale systems at 
Hamburg Karlshöhe & Lübeck Flintenbreite , the source -separation sanitat ion system has been 
stepwise scaled up in the Jenfelder Au district. The district involves 835 homes with more than 
2,000 inhabitants on 0.35 km 2, which is the largest source separation sanitation system in Europe 
(Biederbeck, 2017) . Vacuum pipe transportation (3.7 km network) is applied to deliver the 
collected blackwater to the treatment site where fermenters are located. The blackwater is mixed 
with co -substrates of organic waste and sewage sludge, and separated into the liquid ph ase and 
solid phase and treated through the UASB (liquid phase) and CSTR (solid phase) reactors, 
respectively (Zimmermann et al., 2018) . Combined heat and power plant  is applied, which 
produces ~ 450,000 KWh/year of electricity (equals to 225 household electricity supply in 
Hamburg) (Eaton, 2020) .  
 
China  
China has a long history of applying anaerobic digestion technology to treat animal 
manur e/human waste/agricultural waste, which was due to the appealing bio gas production to 
mitigate energy shortage. As early as the 1880s, a fermenter test was performed in Guangdong. 
In the year 1936, a simple design anaerobic bioreactor - Chinese fixed dome was installed in 
Jiangsu, China (Marchaim, 1992) . In the 1970s -1980s, with the development of “biogas for 
every household” campaign, household biogas plants have been widely installed  in China. The 
simple designed “Chinese dome” digesters are widely applied, which are considered as CSTR 
systems. The mixing in such a system is provided by natural gas production instead of forced 
mechanical or circulation mixing (Zeeman and Kujawa -Roeleveld, 2013) .  
  22 With the development of the concept “Ecological sanitation (Eco -San)” in the 1990s (Esrey et 
al., 1998) , resource -oriented sanitation based on blackwater separate co llection and treatment has 
become a hot topic . Further, the launching of  the “toilet revolution” in China in 2015 helped 
accelerate the establishment of new sanitation systems in rural area s in order to modify the poor 
sanitary conditions, minimize water c onsumption as well as close the resource flow cycle (Cheng 
et al., 2018) . The first demonstration project (under development) with vacuum source -
separation and nutrients recovery from urine and feces was located in Changshu, Jiangsu 
province with a total of 8,959 households and 35,000 inhabita nts (Fan et al., 2017) . A 50 -house 
demonstration project of resource -recovery sanitation was developed in the villages in  Rugao, 
Jiangsu province in 2006. Vacuum toilet collection and transportation systems were installed, 
which only consumed 0.5 L water for blackwater collection (Zhang and Fan, 2019) .  
 
In addition to the above cas es, the full -scale demonstration of source -recovery sanitation has also 
been encouraged and established in other countries. For instance, a 400 household sanitation 
system has been set -up and operated in Ghent, Belgium. The system consisted of the processe s 
for bioenergy recovery from blackwater and kitchen waste through anaerobic digestion, heat 
recovery from greywater through the heat exchanger, water reuse, and nutrients recovery as 
fertilizer through struvite precipitation (De Gusseme et al., 2019) . Other demonstrations have 
been developed in Norway, Indonesia, and India  (Halalsheh and Wendland, 2008; Todt, 2015) . 
The benefits of cost reduction, water conservation, and resource recovery and reuse compared to 
the traditional centralized sanitation system have always acted  as the driving force in advanc ing 
in the establishment of sustainable sanitation system s.  
 
2.5 Research gaps and challenges in blackwater anaerobic treatment  
This section identifies the research gaps in the current blackwater anaerobic treatment field a nd 
outlines the potential challenges in maximizing biomethane recovery efficiency, which helps 
clearly address the motivations of the current work.  
 
2.5.1 Research gaps  
The following aspects have not been well studied and understood:   23 1) Different t oilet f lushing system contributes to variations in blackwater volume and chemical 
properties, blackwater collection source  can influence the treatment  performances .   
2) Organic loading rates were low in the reported work.  
3) No systematical investigation of the process/treatment limitations in blackwater anaerobic 
digestion system.  
4) No microbial information has been provided in previous studies. The functional  microbial 
community structures facing different feedstock types and operational conditions were unkno wn. 
 
2.5.2 Potential challenge s in blackwater anaerobic digestion systems  
In the anaerobic treatment process, the initial  substrate  hydrolysis is considered as a  potential  
rate-limiting step due to the  complex ity of blackwater . Effective substrate hydrolysis requires the 
active function of multiple types of enzymes, such as protease  and cellulase, which strongly 
correlates with the operational temperature and the amount of active biomass. Another potential 
limiting step is the methanogenesis step du e to the vulnerability and sensitivity of methanogens. 
Most of the inhibitors, toxicants or infeasible treatment conditions , for instance, blackwater 
shows  high pH value and contains high ammonium content, can generate significant negative 
impacts on the m ethanogens, probably resulting in process failure. This research is mainly 
concerned with enhancing biomethane recovery from blackwater and understanding microbial 
community development in the system.

The anaerobic digesti on process is an energy efficient waste treatment technology that converts

(Raja
gopal et al ., 2013) . To date, only l imited researc h has been conducte d to evaluate the 
applicati on of anaerobic digesti on proce sses for blackwate r treatment . The few reporte d s tudies 
showe d a wide range of chemical oxyge n dem and (COD ) removal efficiencies (61-80%) and 
methanisati on percentages (39-60%) (Abdel-Sha fy et al., 2009; De Graa ff et al., 2010) . These 
differe
nces can be largel y attributed to the bioreact or systems utilize d (i.e., continuousl y stirred 
tank react or [CST R], accumulati on system [A C], and upflow anaerobic sludge blanket [UASB]) 
and the 
operati ng temperatures adopte d (psychrophilic vs . mesophilic condition). F or ins tance, 
when treati ng vacuum collecte d bla ckwate r, longe r hydraulic retenti on time was normally 
applied t o AC or CST R s ystems (HRT i n the range of 20-150 days) as compared t o UASB 
reac
tors (HRT as low as 8.7 days), whic h can be explained by the fact that UASB reactors enable 
long SRT at relativel y short HRT due t o an internal gas/sludge/liqui d s eparati on system (De 
Graa ff e
t al., 2010) . Furthe r, treatment efficienc y va ries wit h temperature . For example , UASB-
septic ta nk treati ng vacuum collected blackwate r s howe d a high COD removal of 78% at 25 ˚C 
compare d to a 61% COD removal at a lowe r temperature of 15 ˚C (Kujawa-Roelevel d et al., 
2006).  
It should  be noted  t hat  the impacts  of various  blackwater  characteristics  (due to the different 
blackwater  collection  systems,  such a s conventional  t oilet,  dual-flush  toilet,  vacuum  toilet, 
kitc

1.2 L water per flush (Abdel -Shafy et al., 2009; De Graaff et al., 2010; Gallagher and Sharvelle, 
2011; Sharma et al., 2016; Wendland et al., 2007; Zeeman et al., 2008) . Vacuum toilets are 
getting more  attention  in recent years due to their great water -conserving potential. Previous 
study reported that UASB treatment of 9 L flushed blackwater (initial COD concentration of 
1,160 mg/L) achieved 68% COD removal with an average HRT of 24 hours (Abdel -Shafy et al., 
2009) . Anaerobic digestion with  an on -site two -stage  package system (consisting a modified 
septic tank and an upflow anaerobic filter) treating 5 L water per flush blackwater achieved up to 
72.6% total COD removal wi th an HRT of 50 hours (Sharma et al., 2016) . A COD removal of 
75.2% was obtained from a UASB reactor treating dual flush toilet blackwater with an HRT of 4 
days at 28 ˚C (Gallagher and Sharvelle, 2011) . Longer HRTs were used for the treatment of 
vacuum toilet collected blackwater. For instance, anaerobic CSTR operated with an HRT of 20 
days at the mesophilic condition achieved 61% COD removal (Wendland et al., 2007) . UASB 
treatment with an HRT of 8.7 days led to 78% COD removal at 25 ˚C (De Graaff et al., 2010) . 
COD removal of 72 -86% was achieved at 25 ˚C with a pilot -scale UASB septic tank system with 
an HRT of 29 days (Zeeman et al., 2008) .  
The feasibility  of anaerobic blackwater treatment has been evaluated  in the above -mentioned 
literature , which  the observed large variation s in blackwater treatment efficiency underlines the 
importance of understanding the digestibility of blackwater collected from different toilet flush 
systems. V acuum toilet collected blackwater has benefits  of saving water and concentrating 
organic matter to maximize  blackwater energy recovery efficiency . However, high 
concentrations of other pollutants such as metal ions, sulfide, and ammonia  might also inhibit the 
anaerobic digestion processes thus leading to reduced treatability (Chen et al., 2008) . In 
particular, concentrations of free ammonia (FA) are of concern.  
The main objective of the present study is to evaluate and compare the anaerobic energy 
recovery potential from blackwater collected from water -wasting toilets (e.g., conventional or 
dual-flush toilets) and water -conserving toilets (e.g., vacuum toilets). To achieve this goal, 
biological methane potential  (BMP)  experiments and microbial analy sis were performed, and the 
hydrolysis and methanogenesis processes were interpreted to evaluate if any potential inhibitor  33 exists in the blackwater. The current study provides critical information and fundamental 
knowledge in designing source diverted bla ckwater treatment systems for energy recovery, 
which is currently unavailable in the literature.  
 
3.2. Method and materials  
3.2.1 Blackwater  preparation and characterization   
Blackwater stock (feces and urine) was collected using toilet waste bags with no  flush water 
added from healthy adults, seniors, and children on the University of Alberta campus for two 
consecutive weekdays . Blackwater stock was well mixed and stored at 4 ˚C  before further 
experiments . Blackwater stock was diluted using tap water to simulate commonly used 
conventional (9  L water per flush), dual flush (6  L water per flush), and vacuum (1  L water per 
flush) toilet flushing systems, respectively. The total chemical oxygen demand (COD t), 
suspended COD (COD ss), colloidal COD (COD col), soluble COD (COD s), total solids (TS), 
volatile solids (VS), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), 
and pH were analyzed for characterization of different flushed blackwater.  COD, TS, and VS 
were measured  according to the Standard Methods of American Public Health Association 
(APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012) . Inoculum was collected from a mesophilic an aerobic digester 
treating primary sludge in a local wastewater treatment plant. pH was measured using a 
B40PCID pH meter (VWR, SympHony).  
 
3.2.2 Batch assays  
Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests  
Batch experiments were firstly conducted to compare the methane production potential of 
blackwater collected from conventional toilets (9 L water/flush), dual flush toilets (6 L 
water/flush) and vacuum toilets (1 L water/flush). BMP tests were conducted in  157 mL serum 
bottles  in duplicate  at 35 °C in a shaker incubator (120 rpm) under dark conditions. The bottles 
were flushed with nitrogen gas after the addition of blackwater and inoculum and sealed with a 
butyl rubber stopper and an aluminum cap. Methane generation was monitored through 
measuring the bottle headspace pressure and the gas composition. The volatile fatty acid (VFA) 
concentrations were analyzed at the end of the tests. Evaluation of the reason for the cessation  of 
methane production at the en d of the BMP test was performed with dual flush toilet blackwater 34 (6 L water/flush) and vacuum toilet blackwater (1 L water/flush) samples . 
FA inhibition 
Additional BMP tests were conducted to investigate the potential impacts of FA on the 
blackwater an aerobic digestion process. Two trials were performed. In Trial 1 , different amounts 
of NH 4Cl solutions (300 g/L) were added to conventional toilet blackwater (9 L water/flush) , to 
achieve targeted final FA concentrations (i.e., 17, 58, 108, 145, 205, 360, 657 and 2397 mg/L ), 
representing blackwater FA concentrations, conditions ranging from blackwater collected from 
conventional 9 L water per flush toilets (FA=17 mg/L ), dual -flush toilets (FA ranging from 58 -
108 mg/L ), vacuum toilets (FA ranging from 145 -657 mg/L ) to raw blackwater from dry toilets 
with no flush water (FA=2397 mg/L ). In Trial 2 , different volumes of flush water (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 
1.87, 3.23, 6, and 9 L) were appli ed directly to raw blackwater to obtain targeted FA 
concentrations similar to the Trial 1  study (FA ranging from 17 -2397 mg/L ). In Trial 1 , NaOH 
solution (1 M) was used to adjust the pH to the targeted FA concentrations. The TAN 
concentration and pH were m easured for each group before incubation at 35 °C . The experiment 
was set up in duplicate.  
With such design, Trial 1  evaluates if the elevated FA concentration in blackwater with less flush 
water could directly impact the blackwater anaerobic digestion pr ocess; and Trial 2  examines 
whether FA is the main inhibition factor in the blackwater anaerobic digestion process.  
3.2.3 FA inhibition mechanisms  
FA inhibition mechanisms were determined through batch hydrolysis experiments with the 
demonstration of the inhibition effects on different steps in blackwater anaerobic digestion. All 
blackwater samples were prepared using 9 L flushed blackwater as mentio ned in 2.2.2 ( Trial 1 ) 
to evaluate FA changes. Considering the hydrolysis step is commonly a rate -limiting step for 
complex substrates due to slow solubilisation (Wang et al., 2016) , the ratio of input inoculum 
and substrate volume was set to 1:1, to expedite the start -up period and shorten the lag phase. To 
elucidate the effects of FA on each step, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis 
efficiencies were calculated and compa red. Three groups of blackwater samples with FA 
concentrations of 27 mg/L  (representing 9 L flushed blackwater), 114 FA mg/L  (representing 35 3.23 L flushed blackwater), and 405 FA mg/L  (representing 1 L flushed blackwater) were 
selected for hydrolysis test. Each group included four bottles with substrates (blackwater and 
inoculum) and four blanks (water and inoculum). Each set of four bottles (substrates or blanks) 
consisted of two bott les for gas phase (biogas) measurement and two for liquid phase (COD s and 
VFAs) measurements. The methane production in the gas phase, COD s, and VFAs 
concentrations in the liquid phase were measured every 24 hours.  
3.2.4 Microbial  community analysis  
DNA e xtraction was conducted  using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Unflushed raw blackwater and anaerobic digester 
sludge (200 L) were directly used for DNA extraction without previous centrifugatio n, this is 
because the stock blackwater sample and digester sludge contained little water content.  Digested 
9 L, 6 L, and 1 L flushed blackwater samples (2 mL) were centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min, 
discarding the supernatant, and using the pellet for DNA  analysis. The extracted DNA was eluted 
with 100  L Tris -HCl buffer, and its concentration and quality were checked through NanoDrop 
One (ThermoFisher , Waltham MA, USA). All DNA samples were stored at -20 °C until PCR 
was performed. PCR was performed followed by the sequencing experiment on the Illumina 
MiSeq platform. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the universal primer -pair 515F 
(GTGCCAG CMGCCGCGG) and 806R (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT). Similarly, archaeal 
16S rRNA genes were amplified using universal primer set 517F 
(GCYTAAAGSRNCCGTAGC) and 909R (TTTCAGYCTTGCGRCCGTAC). Microbial 
community analysis was performed by RTL Genomics (Texas, USA). The  sequencing platform 
generated 16S Illumina paired -end reads data of both forward and reverse amplicons, which were 
further assembled in contigs and processed running a workflow on QIIME pipeline version 1.9.1 
(Caporaso et al., 2012 ). The reads were clustered against the reference SILVA database project 
(Quast et al., 2013) , and any reads, which do not match the reference data are subsequently 
clustered by using a de novo approach.  
3.2.5 Calculation  methods and equations  
Calculation methods and equations applied in this study, including methane production in BMP 
and hydrolysis tests, methanogenesis efficiency (%), hydrolysis efficiency (%), hydrolysis rate  36 coeffic ient (kh), acidogenesis efficiency (%) and free ammonia concentration, are provided in 
section 3.5 .  
 
3.2.6 T -test and ANOVA analysis  
Student t -test analysis were  performed on BMP values  and lag phase duration between  the two 
trials in FA inhibition tests. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)  was performed on  
hydrolysis and acidogenesis efficiencies for the three conditions in  the hydrolysis test.  T-test and 
ANOVA were performed using the Microsoft Excel® software. A p -value smaller tha n 0.05 
represents statistically significant difference.  
 
3.3. Results and Discussion  
3.3.1 Blackwater characterization  
The characteristics of conventional toilet (9 L water/flush), dual flush toilet (6 L water/flush) and 
vacuum toilet (1 L water/flush) blackwater  samples are presented in Table 3.1. The VS/TS ratio 
of different water flushed blackwater samples was in the range of 0.78 -0.83, in which the high 
fraction of organic matters implied high biodegradability of blackwater. The COD t values of 9 L 
water flushed blackwater were similar to the reported value s (2,887 [±793 ] mg/L ) of blackwater 
from conventional flushing toilets (~9 L/flush) (Knerr et al., 2011) . For all blackwater samples, 
COD ss was 60 -66 % of COD t, COD s was 30 -34 % of COD t, and COD col was only 1.3 -5.7% of 
COD t. Due to the small fraction, COD col was not further considered. The pH of all samples was 
in the range of 8.4 to 8.6, which was comparable to the reported blackwater pH range of 7.4 -9.0 
(Abdel -Shafy et al., 2009; Knerr et al., 2011) . Overall, characteristics of blackwater samples 
gathered in the pre sent study is comparable to those reported in the literature (De Graaff et al., 
2010; Zeeman et al., 2008)  .  
 
It should be  noted that the TAN of 1 L flushed blackwater was high (1,040 mg/L ), which can be 
attributed to protein degradation and the existence of urea. The high pH and high TAN of 1 L 
flushed blackwater lead to high FA concentration which may cause instability in a naerobic 
digestion systems. Similar observation was reported in a previous continuous blackwater 
treatment study, which showed that the shock loading of blackwater with 485 mg FA /L led to a 
temporary methanogenesis process inhibition (De Graaff et al., 2010) . In this study, the initial  37 free ammonia concentrations were 393, 60, and 26 mg FA /L for vacuum toilet (1 L water/flush), 
dual flush toilet (6 L water/flush) and conventional toilet (9 L water/flush) collected blackwater 
at 35 °C, respectively.

3.3.2 Anaerobic  digestion in batch tests  
Biochemical methane potential (BMP)  
BMP of conventional toilet (9 L water/flush), dual flush toilet (6 L water/flush) and vacuum 
toilet (1 L water/flush) collected blackwater  is displayed in Fig . 3.1. A 5 -days lag phase was 
observed for 9 L and 6 L flushed samples, and an 8 -days lag phase was observed for 1 L flushed 
samples. All experiments lasted for 46 days before reaching steady state conditions.  BMP  values 
of 9 L and 6 L flushed blackwater were similar (48%), which was clearly higher than those 
obtained for 1 L flushed blackwater (34%). The biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) over COD 
(BOD/COD) ratio of blackwater was reported to be 48 -71% in the studies  treating relatively low -
strength blackwater with COD 1,000 -2,000 mg/L  (Abdel -Shafy et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2016; 
van Voorthuizen et al., 2008) . The vacuum toilet blackwater with biodegradability of 46 -60% 
was also reported in the literature (De Graaff et al., 2010; Kujawa -Roeleveld et al., 2006) . These 
reported values are comparable with the BMP values of the water -wasting t oilet blackwater in 
this study, with similar digestibility and inhibition potentials. At the end of the BMP tests, VFAs 
concentrations were 79 and 75 mg COD /L for 9 L and 6 L flushed samples, respectively; and 38 was 222 mg COD /L for the 1 L flushed sample.  The low BMP value and the high VFAs 
concentration observed for 1 L flushed blackwater conditions indicate the presence of inhibition 
in these reactors. The evaluation of the ce ssation  of the methane production in 6 L and 1 L 
flushed samples at the end of the experiments indicated that methanogens in 1 L flushed samples 
lost their ability to produce methane while the methanogens were not inhibited and functioned 
well in 6 L flushed blackwater  (section 3.5) .  
Previous studies reported ammonia inhibition in both industrial and municipal waste treatment 
systems, which suppress methane production especially under high temperature and pH 
conditions (Braun et al., 1981; Rajagopal et al., 2013) . The reported FA inhibition concentration 
varied from 45 mg/L  (Kayhanian, 1999)  to 2473 mg/L  (Shanmugam  and Horan, 2009)  in 
different treatment system. The inhibition in 1 L flushed blackwater could be attributed to the 
relatively high FA concentration (393 mg/L ) and therefore, further studies were performed to 
evaluate impacts from FA in blackwater.

water/flush) and vacuum toilet (1 L water/flush) collected blackwater in the biochemical 
methane potential (BMP) test, represented as the percentage of initial feed CODt converted to 
methane (as COD).   
FA inhibition 
 39 To examine the impacts of FA on blackwater BMP, Trial 1  study was performed by directly 
adding additional ammonium source ( NH 4Cl) into 9 L flushed blackwater to achieve targeted 
final concentrations of FA (17, 58, 108, 145, 205, 360, 657, and 2397 mg/L ). FA concentrations 
in each trial and corresponding water flush amount are displayed in Table 3.2. The BMP results 
of the two trials ar e displayed in Fig . 3.2. As shown in Fig. 3.2A, the lag phase was 
approximately  5 days when FA concentration was below 108 mg/L , which increased to 8 days 
when FA concentration went up to 145 mg/L , while BMP values stayed at around 42%. Further, 
when the F A concentration reached 205 mg/L , BMP was significantly reduced from 42% (when 
FA was in the range of 17 -145 mg/L ) to 28%. No methane production was observed when FA 
concentration increased to 2397 mg/L  indicating a completely inhibited process.  
 
Further, Trial 2  was conducted by directly diluting raw blackwater (with no water flush) with 
different volumes of dilution water to obtain targeted FA concentrations comparable to Trial 1  
study. As shown in Fig . 3.2B, similar to Trial 1 , lag phase duratio n of 5 days and BMP of ~ 45% 
was detected for blackwater with FA concentrations ranging from 17 -108 mg/L  (9-3.23 L water 
flush), indicating that no significant inhibition existed within this range. Again, when the FA 
concentration was increased to 146 mg/L  (1.87 L water flush), the lag phase length was increased 
to 7-8 days and BMP values were maintained at 45% . BMP decreased to 31% when the FA 
concentration went up to 218 mg/L  (1.5 L water flush). No methane was detected in more than 
90 days of incubation when the FA concentration was over 2336 mg/L .

Fig. 3.3. Inhibition effects of blackwater from Trial 1  and Trial 2 : (A) the relative percentage of 
BMP achieved at different inhibition conditions compared with non-inhibition conditions (at the 
lowest free ammonia concentration in Trial 1  and with the highest flushing water volume in Trial 
2), the maximum BMP values achieved  were  shown as 100%; (B) the change of lag phase 
duration of methane production in the tests. 
 The BMP and lag phase duration of the two trials of FA inhibition analysis were statistically 
compared using t- tests. As shown in Fi g. 3.3, the inhibition effects from Trial 1  (when FA was 
added in increasing concentrations to 9 L flushed sample) and Trial 2  (when raw blackwater 
received different water volumes to estimate FA concentrations based on dilution) were not 
 42 statistically different in terms of the BMP reduction (p >0.05) and the lag phase extension 
(p >0.05 ). The comparison of two trials illustrated that FA is the major inhibition factor of 
blackwater anaerobic digestion. Therefore, it can be concluded that the decreased BMP in 1 L 
flushed blackwater compared with 6 an d 9 L flushed blackwater samples was a result of FA 
inhibition. Similar observations of ammonia inhibition have been reported widely previously for 
other waste sources. However, the FA inhibition concentration can vary significantly for 
different waste sou rces and treatment conditions.  For instance,  in the  digested pig manure 
inoculated digester, a FA inhibition threshold was identified to be  15-130 mg/L (Astals et al., 
2018) . 
 
3.3.3  Evaluation of the FA inhibition mechanisms  
To further elucidate the impacts of FA on the different stages of the anaerobic digestion process 
(e.g., hydrolysis, acidogenesis and methanogenesis steps), inhibition mechanism studies were 
performed.   
 
Fig. 3.4A shows the change of hydrolysis efficiency at various FA concentrations. The results 
indicated that blackwater with different amounts of FA demonstrated similar hydrolysis 
efficiency trends during 17 days of incubation ( p >0.05 ). The maximum hydrolysis efficiencies 
were in the range of 57 -61% for b lackwater with FA concentrations ranging from 27 -405 mg/L . 
Unlike the reduction in BMP production observed for blackwater with high FA condition, no 
reduction in hydrolysis efficiency was observed with an increase of FA concentration. As shown 
in Table 3.3, the first order hydrolysis rate coefficient  kh had no significant variation among 
samples (all within the range of 0.198 -0.209 d -1), indicating that FA concentrations (in the range 
of 27 -405 mg/L ) had little impact on the blackwater hydrolysis rate. Moreover, no obvious lag 
phase was observed in the hydrolysis process for the analyzed conditions (Fig . 3.4A). It indicated 
that a lag phase time extension, with the increase of FA concentration in BMP tests from circa 5 
days (< 108 mg/L ) to greater than 8  days (> 145 mg/L ), had no correlation to hydrolysis step 
inhibition . The large amount of inoculum addition at the beginning of the test led to sufficient 
microorganisms and enough hydrolysis enzymes excreted for hydrolysis of blackwater contents, 
demonstr ating a capability to thrive in excessive FA concentrations.  
  43 In order to evaluate the acidogenesis efficiencies, the changes of three volatile fatty acids were 
monitored during the hydrolysis test, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. As shown in  
Fig. 3.4B, the acidogenesis process started immediately after incubation, and the acidogenesis 
efficiency reached ~ 40 -43% for all samples tested. ANOVA analysis indicated that no 
significant difference in the change of acidogenesis efficiency was observe d in blackwater 
samples at various FA concentrations ( p >0.05 ). Therefore, the increasing FA (27-405 mg/L ) 
showed no impact on acidogenesis in the blackwater digestion process in the present study. It is 
also important to notice that the acidogenesis products were mostly VFAs instead of CH 4 at FA 
405 mg/L , with the VFAs accumulated to 590 mg COD /L after 17 days.  
 
Same samples were then used to evaluate the potential FA impacts on the methanogenesis step. 
As shown in Fig . 3.4C, during the 17 days incubation, the methanogenesis efficiencies of the 
samples with 27 and 114 mg/L  FA were similar, reaching 43% (  3%) and 39% (  4%), 
respectively. However, the methanogenesis efficiency value was only 8% (  1%) for blackwater 
with 405 mg/L  FA. The lag phase for methane production was less than 1 day when FA 
concentration was below 114 mg/L . As compared to the lag phase (5 days) observed in the BMP 
test, the observed short lag phase can be attributed to the application of large amounts of 
inoculum pr ovided at the beginning of this inhibition mechanism study (also refer to the 
methodology section 3.2.3). On the contrary, an 8 -day lag phase was observed for blackwater 
with initial FA concentration of 405 mg/L , despite the much larger amount of inoculum applied 
in this inhibition mechanism test.   
 
With the combined analysis of different reaction steps in the blackwater digestion process, it can 
be concluded that the high FA concentration in blackwater mainly affected the methanogenesis 
step, which led to the decreased BMP at high FA concentrations. This is in agreement with 
previous studies where the methanogenesis step was considered as a rate -limiting step especially 
when the system was inhibited by excess FA (Wang et al., 20 16). The results also indicated that 
compared with hydrolysis and fermentation bacteria, methanogens were more sensitive to the FA 
toxicity.   44

3.3.4 Microbial  population dynamics in blackwater anaerobic digestion processes  
No study has been reported to date on the impacts of FA on the change of microbial communities 
in a blackwater anaerobic treatment system. In this study, the analysis of microbial population  
structure further elucidated the FA inhibition effects.  
 
Microbial community analysis resulted in an average of 59,890 ± 6,655 reads and 8,322 OTUs 
for the bacterial community, while 23,688 ± 3,506 reads and 227 OTUs were obtained for the 
archaeal communi ty. The relative abundance of bacterial taxonomic groups in the inoculum, raw 
blackwater , and digested blackwater samples (9 L and 1 L water flushed) are illustrated in Fig. 
3.5. Overall, the bacterial community was mainly dominated by phylum Firmicutes, 
Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria for all samples. The inoculum did not show a distinct 
dominance of any of the bacterial group with the relative abundance of Firmicutes (10.1%), 
Bacteroidetes (17.2%), and Proteobacteria (21.7%) that were observed higher th an others. 
Phylum Bacteroidetes (42.8%) and Firmicutes (53.9%) were predominant in raw blackwater 
sample. They also showed high relative abundance in 1 L (59.3% Bacteroidetes, 22.5% 
Firmicutes) and 9 L (48.3% Bacteroidetes, 21.3% Firmicutes) flushed sample s, suggesting their 
tolerance to high ammonia levels. In phylum Bacteroidetes, the organisms from the order 
Bacteroidales presented the highest abundance in 9 L and 1 L flushed samples, with 48.3% and 
59.3% of total bacterial reads, respectively. In phylum  Firmicutes, members from the class 
Clostridia represented 20.4% and 21.6% in 9 L and 1 L flushed samples, wherein, the  46 Clostridiales order represented 20.4% and 15%, respectively. Phylum Proteobacteria and 
Synergistetes did not show high abundance in 1 L flushed samples (1% and 0.4%), but showed 
13.8% and 2.3% relative abundance in 9 L condition. Overall, 9 L flushed samples showed 
higher microbial community diversity in comparison to 1 L flushed blackwater (Fig. 3.5).   
 
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes have been commonly found in anaerobic digesters (Kampmann et 
al., 2012) , which include various genera capable of degrading wide range of carbohydrates and 
proteins (Cardinali -Rezende et al., 2011) , and are mainly reported as acid -forming/fermentative 
bacteria in blackwater digestion. Members of Bacteroidetes were predom inantly found in 
protein -rich systems and in human feces. They were mostly considered as acidogenic and 
involved in the proteolytic process (Liu et al., 2009) . Previous research reported that 
Bacteroidetes showed high stabi lity under the changes of pH and substrate types (Kampmann et 
al., 2012) . Moreover, phylum Firmicutes has been reported as a predominant community at 
elevated ammonia levels (> TAN 3.0 g/L) (Li et al., 2015) . These studies are consistent with the 
high abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in both digested blackwater samples observed in 
the present study.  
 
47 Fig. 3. 5. Relative abundance of bacteria l taxonomic groups of the inoculum, undigested raw 
blackwater  (BW Stock) , digested conventional toilet blackwater  (9 L digested BW) , and digested 
vacuum toilet blackwater  (1 L digested BW) at the end of the BMP test.   
Class Clostridia (in phylum Firmicutes) has been reported to be involved in hydrolysis, 
acidogenesis, and acetogenesis, in which members of the order Clostridiales can generate 
cellulosomes that degrade cellulose and provide substrates to help with the gro wth of acetogens 
and methanogens. They also contribute to the syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) process, which, 
as a separate path combined with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, can convert acetate to 
hydrogen when acetoclastic methanogens are inhibited d ue to ammonia inhibition (Schnürer and 
Nordberg, 2008) . Genus Clostridium was found to generate hydrogen from complex substrates 
(Wang et al., 2017) . Further, for phylum Proteobacteria and Synergistetes, it has been observed 
that they can be inh ibited by excess FA in the manure digestion system (Li et al., 2015) . It has 
also been reported that with TAN concentration below 3.0 g/L, phylum Synergistetes  was 
dominant, while TAN over 3.0 g/L demonstrated a community shift to Firmicutes during 
mesophilic anaerobic digestion (Park et al., 2016) . These previously reported studies correlated 
well with the results in this study that phylum Proteobacteria and Synergistetes showed higher 
fractions in 9 L flushed samples than in 1 L flushed samples, which was due to the high FA 
concentration in 1 L condition.  
Varying types of methanogens respond differently to inhibition. Fig. 3.6 showed  the relative 
abundance of archaeal taxonomic groups in the inoculum, 9 L, and 1 L water flushed digested 
blackwater samples. Overa ll, 99% of the archaeal reads could be assigned to the genus level, and 
all identified genera were involved in methanogenic processes. The dominant archaeal group in 
digested blackwater samples belong to the Euryarchaeota  phylum suggesting the detected 
archaea were methanogens (Luo et al., 2009) . Methanobacterium, Methanoculleus, 
Methanolinea, Methanomicrobiales, and Methanosarcina  were identified in all the digested 
samples (Fig . 3.6).  48  
Fig. 3. 6. Relative abundance of archaeal taxonomic groups of the inoculum, digested vacuum 
toilet blackwater  (1 L digested BW) and digested conventional toilet blackwater (9 L digested 
BW)  at the end of the BMP test . 
 
Members of Methanosarcina  are reported to be the most metabolically versatile group among the 
methanogens, able to use three pathways to generate methane including hydrogenotrophic, 
acetoclastic, or methylotrophic pathways (Lambie et al., 2015) , while other than Methanosarcina , 
the rest detected methanogens in the present study would only use hydrogenotrophic pathway. 
The observation o f these methanogens in digested samples indicated the systems could have 
multiple methanogenesis pathways for methane generation in blackwater digestion. 
Methanosarcina  was the predominant genus members in 9 L and 1 L digested samples. This 
genus as mixotr ophic methanogens has been reported with higher tolerance to ammonia toxicity 
compared to acetoclastic methanogens (Lü et al., 2013) . With the morphology study,  
Methanosarcina  is considered to be robust to ammonia inhibition due to its spherical cells, 
resulting in  a lesser probability of FA diffusion into cells (Wiegant and Zeeman, 1986) . But 
reported study showed that it could not actively transform acetate to methane under inhibition 
conditions when ammonia concentration increased above 4 g NH 4Cl /L with acetate 
accumulation (> 120 mM acetate) in a swine manure digestion system (Zhang et al., 2017) . It 
 49 should be noted that although the abundance of genus Methanosarcina  was similar in 1 L and 9 
L flushed samples (64.1% in 1 L, 61.2% in 9 L), acetate accumulation and low methanogenesis 
efficiency were observed in 1 L condition . Greater diversity of methanogens was found in 9 L 
flushed samples at genus level, in which organisms from the genus Methanosaeta and 
Methanomassiliicoccus were exclusively detected. The genus Methanosaeta,  as acetoclastic 
methanogens, was reported with l ow tolerance to ammonia compared to hydrogenotrophic 
methanogens (Angelidaki and Ahring, 1993) . The specific growth rate of acetoclastic 
methanogens was halved at an ammonia concentration of 3.5 g N /L while the ammonia 
concentration was doubled for h ydrogenotrophic methanogens to show the same reduction 
(Angelidaki and Ahring, 1993) . Methanobacterium  and Methanolinea  showed higher abundance 
in 9 L flushed blackwater condition while Methanoculleus  and Methanomicrobiales  showed 
higher abundance in 1 L flushed samples. Strong correlation of archaeal community structure 
with ammonia concentration has also been reported in the literature, and it has been observed 
that members of Methanoculleus  genus tend to exist at high amm onia level (Zhang et al., 2017; 
Ziganshin et al., 2013) . Similarly, Methanomicrobiales methanogens were reported to be 
ammonia resistant, which correlates to our study that Methanomicrobiales  was present only in 
the 1 L flushed blackwater (Angenent et al., 2002) . As different methanogens have d ifferent 
tolerance to ammonia concentration, the higher diversity of archaeal structure in the 9 L flushed 
condition can be attributed to the more favorable microbial growth condition with low ammonia 
concentration compared to the 1 L flushed condition wit h high ammonia concentration.  
 
It has also been reported that the methanogenic pathway could shift from acetoclastic 
methanogenesis to syntrophic acetate oxidization (SAO) combined with hydrogenotrophic 
methanogenesis against ammonia inhibition (Lü et al., 2013) , which can be correlated to the 
abundance of bacterial taxonomic groups of Clostridia  in our study. However, although the 
methanogenesis pathway tended to shift against ammonia inhibition and the ammonia tolerant 
methanogens were able to function, methanogenic efficiency was found to decrease under 
inhibition state at high FA concentration .  
  50 3.4. Conclusion  
Our results indicated that the energy recovery potential of blackwater collected from different 
sources is different. Blackwater collected from water -conserving toilets generated lower BMP as 
compared to water -wasting toilets.  Methane  generation from vacuum toilet collected balckwater 
was low due to the FA inhibition on the methanogenesis step. Microbial analysis showed that the 
archaeal populations in the vacuum toilet collected blackwater reactor shifted to more ammonia 
tolerant meth anogens. Our results demonstrated that when considering energy recovery from 
blackwater collected from water -conserving toilets, the wastewater properties, such as pH and 
ammonia concentration that may lead to process inhibition should be carefully conside red. 
 
3.5. Supplementary materials  
3.5.1 Blackwater preparation and characterization methods  
Blackwater stock (raw blackwater) was collected using toilet waste bags with no flush water 
added. Blackwater samples were obtained from 10 individuals, including healthy adults, seniors, 
and children (no medication intake prior to the blackwater collectio n) on the University of 
Alberta campus for two consecutive weekdays in December 2016. All blackwater samples were 
mixed, blended with a low speed blender, and stored at 4 ˚C  before further experiments. To 
evaluate blackwater digestibility, anaerobic digester (AD) sludge from a local municipal 
wastewater treatment plant operating a steady biosolids anaerobic digestion system was used as 
the inoculum.  
 
To determine the COD ss, COD col, and COD s, samples wer e firstly filtered using 8 m filter 
paper; the fraction retained on the filter paper was considered as COD ss. Paper filtered samples 
were subsequently seeped into 0.45 m membrane filters, and COD s was the fraction that filtered 
through the membrane. COD col was calculated as the samples that can pass through 8 m filter 
but was retained on the 0.45 m membrane (Zhang et al., 2013) . TN was analyzed with the Hach  
TNT total nitrogen reagent set (DR -3900, Hach, CO, USA). TAN and TP were measured using 
Hach TNTplus vial tests (DR -3900, Hach, CO, USA).  
 
3.5.2 Batch  assays  
Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests   51 BMP tests were initially performed with 9 L, 6 L, and 1 L flushed blackwater in 157 mL serum 
bottles. Blank bottles with tap water and inoculum were used to evaluate biogas generated from 
the inoculum. Trace metals were considered to be sufficient in blackwater samples, and no 
additional trace elements we re added. Biogas generation was monitored by measuring the 
headspace pressure using a GMH3151 manual pressure meter (Greisinger, Regenstauf, 
Germany). Biogas composition was measured using a 7890B gas chromatograph (Agilent 
Technologies, Santa Clara USA) e quipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two 
columns (Molsieve 5A 2.44 m 2 mm for CH 4 and Hayesep N 1.83 m 2 mm for N 2, O2 and CO 2). 
The temperature of the oven, injector, and detector was 100 , 150, and 200 °C, respectively. A 
volume of 2 mL headspace gas per sample was analyzed with the GC loop injection method. The 
headspace pressure was measured before and after each injection of the GC measurement. The 
incubation time for BMP tests lasted for 55 days to ensure completion of biogas producti on. 
Samples for VFA measurements were prepared by dilution and filtered through 0.2 m nylon 
syringe filters. Concentrations of three main VFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate) were 
determined with a DIONEX ICS -2100 Ionic chromatography (IC) (ThermoFishe r, Waltham MA, 
USA) (De Graaff et al., 2010) .  
 
At the end of the BMP studies, the cause for the ce ssation  of methane production was evaluated. 
Firstly, to investigate whether the lack of substrates led to the cease of methane production, 
sodium acetate solution, as additional carbon source, was added to blackwater samples with (1 L 
water flush) and without (6 L water flush) inhibition on day 55 to provide substrate of 1 g COD 
/L. The methane production was monitored after the addition of acetate. Further, to evaluate 
whether methanogens were inhibited, 100 L fresh inoculum was added to the 1 L water flushed 
blackwater sample after the acetate was added and  no additional methane production was 
observed; and 6 L water flushed blackwater sample after methane production stopped in the 
acetate addition step. The methane production was monitored after the addition of fresh 
inoculum with the same procedure as desc ribed above.

 54 3.5.4 Results and Discussion of biochemical methane potential (BMP) test  
The cessation  of the methane production at the end of the experiments was assumed to be 
attributed to (i) the lack of substrate for methanogens and/or (ii) the reduction of methanogenic 
activities due to inhibition factors such as FA toxicity or the VFAs accumulation. To evaluate the 
mechanism of the methane production limitation, tests were performed with selected digested 
blackwater samples, including 6 L flushed blackwater and 1 L flushed blackwater groups after 
the methane production stopped.    
After acetate addition, 6 L flushed blackwater samples immediately had methane production, and 
the methane generation lasted for 11 days (data not shown) until it reached its maximum capacity. 
The results showed that acetate was successfully converted into metha ne in 6 L flushed samples 
(CH 4/COD t>95%). After the addition of fresh inoculum,  no further methane was generated  in 
these samples, which indicated methanogens were active and the cessation  of methane 
production was due to the depletion of available substra tes.  
However, for 1 L flushed samples, no methane production was observed after acetate addition. 
Since acetate is the hydrolysis/fermentative product that could be directly utilized by 
methanogens, this result demonstrated that the methanogens were comp letely inhibited at this 
point which led to the cease of methane production. After the addition of fresh inoculum, 
methane generation was detected, which demonstrated that there was available substrate for 
methane production in 1 L flushed digested samples . It further verified that the methanogenesis 
step in low water flushed sample (1 L per flush) was inhibited. These results indicated that 
although a fraction of methanogens was able to work at the beginning of the BMP studies, they 
could not easily adapt to the inhibition condition and only maintain under a “inhibited steady 
state” (Chen et al., 2008) , which refers to the process where methanogens are inhibited but can 
work steadily with a low methane yield. At the end of the experiment, methanogens com pletely 
lost their ability to produce methane in the 1 L flushed samples. For the less concentrated 
blackwater sample (6 L flushed blackwater), the methanogens were not inhibited and functioned 
well.   55 Table S3. 2. Metal concentration in blackwater stock.

HOUSEHOLD BLACKWATER: IMPACTS FROM FEED SULFATE2 
4.1. Introduction 
The feasibilit y of anaerobic digestion wit h different system designs a nd operational parameters 
has bee n demonstrated for conventional toilet blackwate r treatment a round the world (Gallagher 
and Sharvelle , 2011; Sharma et al ., 2016; va n Voorthuize n et al., 2008) . Howeve r, most of these 
reporte
d studies focused on pursuing high effluent quality while low methanisation rates (ranging 
from 20-29%) were ofte n observe d (Bwapwa , 2012; G ao et al., 2019a; Luostarine n et al., 2007; 
van Voorthuizen et al ., 2008) , but has neve r been s ystematicall y studie d. For ins tance , a 
me
thanisation rate of approximatel y 20% was obtaine d in a two-phase d upflow anaerobic sludge 
blanket (UAS B) septic ta nk react or due t o t he limite d substrate hydrolysis unde r l ow operational 
temperatures (10 and 20 °C) (Luostarine n e t al., 2007) . A 28% methanisati on rate was

system a nd was attribute d to the loss of biod egradable contents duri ng blackwate r col lection 
(Bwapwa , 2012) . Furthe r, a methanisati on ra te of 27% was achieve d in a combine d UASB-
membrane system , whic h was explaine d by the considerable substrate wash-out i n the UASB 
treatment stage (van Voorthuizen et al., 2008).  
Our previous batch experiments have demonstrated  a high bio-methane potential (BMP) of 0.48 
g CH 4-COD/g feed COD for conventional toilet collected blackwater (Gao et al., 2019b), while a 
l
ow methanisation  rat e of less t han  30% of  feed COD  (G ao et al., 2019a ) was observed  when 
trea

water content) had a much higher methanisation rate (~44% of feed COD) when treated with the 
UASB  (Gao  et a l.,  2019c).  However,  i t is unc lear  why the l ow  methanisation  was observed  for 
conventional  toilet  collected  blackwater.  The current  s tudy aims  to investigate  t he fundamental

Environ. Prot. 136, 28–38. 61 contributed from the toilet flushing water (60 -70 mg SO 42-/L). Sulfate in wastewater stream can 
result in a reduced biomethane recovery potential and emission of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The 
emitted hydrogen sulfide causes  sewer pipes  corrosion, odorous problem and health concerns 
(Guisasola et al., 2008) . The hydrogen sulfide also poses inhibition effects on methanogens in 
anaerobic bioreactors. This point is of significant importance to the overall sustainabil ity and 
economics in decentralized sanitation system and has never been illustrated in other studies. The 
methanogenic pathways and microbial community structure development were investigated in 
this study to reveal the linkage between microorganisms and t reatment performance. The current 
work could help to better understand the anaerobic treatment of conventional toilet blackwater 
and guide future operations and system designs.  
4.2. Materials and methods  
4.2.1 Feedstock collection and reactor operation  
Raw blackwater (absent flush water) was collected from the University of Alberta campus 
(Edmonton, Canada). Raw blackwater was then stirred and mixed with toilet flushing water (i.e., 
tap water) to represent conventional blackwater, containing 9 L water per flush. The flushing 
water was changed to d eionized (DI) water at the later stage (Phase II) of the experiment to 
demonstrate the impact of flush -water characteristics on blackwater methane recovery.  
The anaerobic treatment of blackwater was co nducted in a laboratory UASB reactor with a 
working volume of 4.2 L. The reactor was inoculated with 2.1 L of anaerobic digester sludge 
from a local anaerobic digester treating primary sludge (Edmonton, Canada) containing 13.1 
(±0.6) g volatile suspended s olids (VSS)/L. The blackwater -feed was pumped continuously into 
the UASB with a peristaltic pump (Longer pump BT 100 -2J). The operating temperature was 
controlled at mesophilic temperature (35 °C) using a heating blanket. The bioreactor was 
optimized for b lackwater treatment through stepwise reduction of HRT (over 240 days, data not 
shown). The optimized HRT for methane recovery from conventional blackwater was 2.2 days. 
For the current study, the total operation period lasted for 105 days, which was divide d into three 
operation phases as shown in Table 4.1. The operation conditions were maintained with organic 
loading rates (OLR) of 0.45 kg COD/m 3/d and HRT of 2.2 days in all three phases; different 
flush -water (tap water or DI water) was used in certain ph ases.   62  
4.2.2 Activity test  
Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) tests were performed with UASB sludge at the end of 
each operation phase with hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases ( H2&CO 2) and sodium acetate 
substrates to investigate the specific activities f rom hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and 
acetoclastic methanogenesis. Prior to each assay, UASB sludge was discharged  from all side 
ports of the sludge bed, mixed, and characterized for pH, VSS, and COD concentrations. The test 
was then conducted in 166 mL serum bottles, with substrate concentration (H 2&CO 2 or acetate) 
of 1 g/L and pH adjusted to 7 using NaOH (5M) or HCl (5 M). H 2/CO 2 (80%/20%) gas and N 2 
gas were applied to flush the headspace of the serum bottles for SMA (H 2&CO 2) and SMA 
(acetate) assays, respectively. The bottles were then sealed with rubber septums and aluminum 
caps. The tests were conducted in an incubator shaker (New Brunswick™ Innova® 44, 
Eppendorf, Canada) at 35 °C and 130 rpm in dark condition. Methane production was 
determined by me asuring the headspace pressure of the serum bottles using a pressure meter 
(GHM 3151, Germany), and the methane fraction in the biogas was measured using a gas 
chromatography (GC) (7890B Agilent Technologies, USA) system equipped with a thermal 
conductivit y detector (TCD). Each group of SMA tests was conducted in triplicates. The SMA 
values were calculated  from dividing the  initial  linear slope of the methane production curve 
over the sludge VSS in each bottle.  Blank control  groups  with only sludge were set -up 
simultaneously to subtract the methane production from sludge in the test group. The SMA 
(acetate and H2 & CO 2) results were presented with average values of the triplicate  bottles  as g 
CH 4-COD/g sludge VSS/d  with standard devi ations.  
 
4.2.3 DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing  
Triplicated sludge sampling from all ports of the UASB sludge bed were conducted, and the 
sampled sludge were mixed for each DNA extraction test at the end of each operation phase 
(Table 4.1) to investigate the microbial community structure variations. The genomic DNA of 
UASB sludge samples were extracted in duplicates. DNA was extracted from 1.5 mL mixed 
sludge samples from following the manufacturer’s protocol using DNeasy PowerSoil Kit 
(QIAGEN,  Hilden, Germany). The quality of the extracted DNA was checked in NanoDrop One 
(ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA), and the samples were stored at -20 °C before sending to the 63 RTL Genomics sequencing center (Texas, USA). Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified 
using the universal primer -pair 357wF  (5’-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG -3’) and 785R  (5’-
GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC -3’). Archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the 
universal primer set 517F  (5’-GCYTAAAGSRNCCGTAGC -3’) and 909R  (5’-
TTTCAGYCTTGCGRCCGTAC -3’). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina MiSeq PE300 
platform.  
Paired -end reads data of forward and reverse sequences were analyzed using the QIIME2 
(Bolyen et al., 2019)  plugin “DADA2” (Callahan et al., 2016)  to remove the low -quality 
sequences and chimeras. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the QIIME2 plugin 
“phylogeny”, and taxonomy was assigned using the QIIME2 plugin “feature -classifier” 
(Bokulich et al., 2018)  and Greengenes (version 13_8) 99% classifier (Campanaro et al., 2018) .  
4.2.4 Chemical a nalysis  
The chemical properties of total COD (COD t), soluble COD (COD s), tot al suspended solids 
(TSS), and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were tested following standard methods 
(APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012) . The total ammonium -nitrogen (NH 4+-N) (using 0.45 m 
membrane filtered samples), sulfate (SO 42-) (using 0.45 m membrane filtered samples) and total 
phosphorus (TP) concentrations were measured using Hach TNT vial tests (Hach, USA). The 
three volatile fatty acids (VFAs) acetate, propionate, and butyr ate, and anions (F -, Cl -, NO 3-, 
NO 2-, Br -) were tested using a DIONEX ICS -2100 Ionic chromatography (IC) system (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA, USA) equipped with a conductivity detector. The total sulfides 
and dissolved sulfides (using 0.45 m memb rane filtered samples) were measured with the 
methylene blue method using Hach method 8131 (Hach, USA). The liquid pH was measured 
using a B40PCID pH meter (VWR, SympHony). The volume of produced biogas was measured 
from the gas bag at the top of the UASB,  and the biogas composition was determined by gas 
chromatography. Chemical property measurements of the influent blackwater, UASB effluent, 
and the biogas production were carried out 3 – 5 times each week. UASB sludge 
characterizations including COD, TSS, VSS, and pH were performed 1 – 2 times in each phase.   64 4.2.5 Calculations  
Sulfate and sulfides  
In the anaerobic treatment system, a ratio of 1:0.67 for SO 42-:COD was used to calculate the 
COD consumed by sulfate reduction (Jeong et al., 2008) . Sulfate (SO 42-) can be reduced to 
sulfides ( i.e., H 2S, HS -, S2-) in the liquid phase and H 2S in the gas phase. At a neutral pH under 
anaerobic digestion conditions, S 2- is negligible (Isa et al., 1986) , and the free hydrogen sulfide 
(H2S) in the liquid phase can be calculated by the first stage ionizatio n equilibrium equation 
described below (Isa et al., 1986) : 
[𝐻2𝑆]𝑠=𝑓×[𝑇𝑆]𝑠 
𝑓=(1+𝐾1
10−𝑝𝐻)−1
 
Where:  
[𝐻2𝑆]𝑠 is the concentration of free H 2S in the liquid phase;  
[𝑇𝑆]𝑠 is the concentration of total dissolved sulfides ( 𝐻2𝑆+𝐻𝑆−+𝑆2−) in the liquid phase;  
f is the fraction of free H 2S of the total dissolved sulfides;  
K1 is the first stage equilibrium constant, and 𝐾1=1.49×10−7 (35 °C)  (Isa et al., 1986) ; 
 
The equilibrium between gas phase H 2S and dissolved free H 2S concentration is controlled by 
Henry’s Law (Isa et al., 1986) .  
 
Methane production rate and methanisation rate  
The methane production rate was calculated from the amount of m ethane generated from per 
volume of the reactor daily and is expressed as mL CH 4/ L reactor/d. The methanisation rate was 
calculated from the amount of methane as COD (g CH 4-COD) generated from the feed 
blackwater COD and was presented as the percentage (% ) of influent COD that converted to 
methane.  
 
The average values of results shown for each operation phase ( e.g., COD removal efficiency, 
methane production rate, methanisation rate) were calculated from the steady -state results, where 65 the steady -state was  indicated by relatively stabilized effluent quality and methane production 
from data of at least one week after the change of operation condition.

Table 4.1 shows the chemical properties of blackwater used for different operation periods 
(Phases I – III). Blackwater containing tap -water collected in Phases I and III generated average 
total COD concentrations of 1026 (±70) and 980 (±47) mg/L, respectively. Co mparable COD 
concentrations (1021 [± 49] mg/L) were obtained in the blackwater containing DI water used in 
Phase II. Only 26% of the total COD was contributed by soluble contents, which indicates a high 
fraction of solid organics was accounted for in the b lackwater stream. These feed COD 
concentrations were comparable with the reported values of 932 – 1983 mg/L for blackwater 
collected from conventional toilets (Gallagher and Sharvelle, 2010; Knerr et al., 2011; Sharma et 
al., 2016; van Voorthuizen et al., 2008) .  
When tap water flushing was applied, sulfate co ncentrations of 79.9 (  4.7) mg/L and 85.0 (  
2.5) (Phases I and III, respectively) were obtained, which was attributed to the sulfate contents in 
local tap water (61.1 [ 1.2] mg/L) and human excreta (feces and urine). This result is 
comparable to the blac kwater sulfate concentration reported previously (Rose et al., 2 015). When 
DI water was used as toilet flushing water in Phase II, the feed sulfate was considerably less than 
in Phases I and III, measuring at 24.0 (  3.1) mg/L.  66 4.3.2 UASB treatment performance of conventional toilets collected blackwater  
The UASB treatment performance as indicated by COD removal, methane production, sulfate 
removal, and sulfides variations is exhibited in Fig. 4.1. In Phase I, with the system well adapted 
to the operational conditions ( i.e., OLR of 0.45 kg COD/m 3/d and HRT  of 2.2 d ays), the influent 
COD was removed with a relatively stable effluent COD concentration of 167.1 ( 34.3) mg/L 
and a COD removal efficiency of 82.4 ( 1.6) % ( Fig. 4.1A). The average methane production 
rate was 58.0 ( 6.9) mL/L/d ( Fig. 4.1B) and resu lted in a methanisation rate of 31.9 ( 2.7) %.  
Sulfate reduction was observed with blackwater COD removal . Fig. 4.1C depicts that 81.7 ( 4.0) 
% (Phase I) of the feed sulfate was removed and converted to sulfides under anaerobic 
conditions. The produced total sulfide and dissolved sulfide concentrations in the UASB effluent 
were 16.3 ( 1.2) mg/L and 14.9 ( 1.1) mg/L ( Fig. 4.1D), respectively. Since the UASB effluent 
was at neutral pH ~7, most of the dissolved sulfide was in the form of free H 2S with an average 
concentration of 9.8 ( 1.2) mg/L in Phase I. The concentration of free H 2S in the gas phase was 
calculated to be 48 21.6 (639.7 ) ppm ( Fig. 4.1E). Similar levels of sulfides production have been 
observed previously in treating starch wastewa ter with a COD/sulfate ratio of 10 and similar 
feedstock characteristics (COD 1,000 mg/L) as the blackwater tested in the present study; the 
detected total and dissolved sulfide concentrations were 15.6 mg/L and 12.9 mg/L, respectively, 
and the free H 2S co ncentration was approximately 4.2 mg/L (Lu et al., 2016) . Overall, 94.6 
(9.4) % of the removed sulfate content could be balanced out from the measured sulfides  in the 
UASB effluent and the gas phase. Unaccounted sulfate portions may have been consumed by 
metal precipitation and cell synthesis (Khanal and Huang, 2005) .   67

4.3.3 Impact of toilet flushing water on UASB treatment performance  
The impact of toilet flushing water was evaluated by feeding blackwater mixed with DI water 
(low feed sulfate) into the UASB under the same operational conditions as in Phase I.  
 
The COD removal efficiency early in Phase II was 79.9 ( 1.8) %, whereas a re latively low 
effluent COD concentration of 141.6 ( 13.4) mg/L was achieved after 20 days of operation, 
which resulted in an increased COD removal to 85.4 ( 1.1) %. The methane production and 
methanisation rate both gradually increased from 58.0 ( 6.9) mL/L /d to 73.5 ( 2.8) mL/L/d and 
from 31.9 ( 2.7) % to 42.1 ( 1.4) %, respectively, resulting in a 30% increase from Phase I. The 
effluent sulfate concentration in Phase II (13.5 [ 0.5] mg/L) did not differ considerably from 
Phase I (14.5 [ 3.0] mg/L), while a  decreased sulfate removal efficiency to 42.8 ( 6.9) % was 
observed. Consequently, the concentrations of total sulfide, dissolved sulfide, free H 2S in UASB 
effluent, and H 2S in gas phase decreased to 5.0 ( 0.7) mg/L, 4.6 ( 0.6) mg/L, 2.6 ( 0.8) mg/L, 
and 1218.8  (400.2 ) ppm, respectively.  
 
In order to further verify the sulfate impact, the sulfate was supplemented to the blackwater feed 
by applying tap water for blackwater flushing, achieving a sulfate concentration of 85.0 ( 2.5) 
mg/L in Phase III. The CO D removal efficiency first slightly increased to 88.0 ( 2.9) % and then 
gradually stabilized at 84.8 ( 2.3) %. The methane production slowly decreased until it reached a 
relatively steady state of 62.0 ( 6.3) mL/L/d, which was comparable to Phase I with 58 .0 (6.9) 
mL/L /d. Correspondingly, the methanisation rate in Phase III decreased to 34.4 ( 2.9) %. The 
sulfate removal efficiency increased to 84.7 ( 2.7) % with an effluent sulfate concentration of 
13.0 (2.1) mg/L. The total sulfide, dissolved sulfide, a nd free H 2S concentrations in UASB 
effluent were 17.9 ( 1.4), 17.0 ( 1.2), and 6.5 ( 1.1) mg/L respectively, and the H 2S 
concentration in the gas phase was 31 00.0 (516.6 ) ppm. Overall, the variations of sulfate and 
sulfide components in the treatment process in Phase III was comparable to the values observed 
in Phase I.   69 Limited amount of VFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) were detected in the UASB effluent 
throughout the whole operational period. When tap -water blackwater was treated, t he total VFA 
concentrations of 31.6 ( 3.4) mg COD/L were observed, which were composed of acetate 8.0 
(1.4) mg COD/L, propionate 21.0 ( 2.4) mg COD/L, and butyrate 2.5 ( 0.6) mg COD/L. In the 
DI-water blackwater fed condition, the total VFA concentration of 24.3 ( 0.8) mg COD/L 
including acetate 6.3 ( 0.6) mg COD/L, propionate 16.2 ( 0.6) mg COD/L and butyrate 1.8 
(0.0) mg COD/L were detected. The low residual VFA contents correlated well with the high 
COD removal efficiencies (82.4 -85.4%) obtained under both tap -water and DI -water blackwater 
fed conditions. The results are in agreement with previous reported studies, suggesting that 
although the electron transfer route shifted at lower COD/ sulfate ratios, the organics removal 
efficacies were not negative ly impacted (Lu et al., 2016) .

by sulfate reduction as COD -Sulfate and COD remained in the UASB effluent as COD -Effluent 
(A), UASB sludge specific methanoge nic activity (SMA [H 2&CO 2], SMA [Acetate]) (B).  
The COD mass balance was calculated for each operation phase at steady -state and presented as 
COD partitioned into accumulation in sludge, methane production, sulfate reduction, and effluent 
residue ( Fig. 4.2A). Overall, a total of 88.0 – 91.1 % of the input COD could be balanced out in 
the effluent. Throughout the whole operation, the effluent COD only accounted for 14.6 – 17.6 
% of the input COD, indicating relatively effective COD removal under all conditions. After 
lowering the sulfate content in the blackwater feed in Phase II, the proportion of the input COD 
that converted to methane showed a significant increase from 31.9 % (Phase I) to 42.1% (Phase 
II), while it dropped to 34.4 % (Phase III) aft er the sulfate was supplemented back into the feed. 
Correspondingly, the COD inflow that was consumed by sulfate reduction initially dropped from 
4.2 % (Phase I) to 0.8 % (Phase II), then increased back to 4.9 % (Phase III). The COD 
accumulation in sludge decreased from 37.5 % to 30.4 % in Phase II and then increased to 34.4 
% in Phase III.  
Fig. 4.2B presents the UASB sludge properties of specific methanogenic activities (SMA) in 
each operation phase. Generally, the methanogenesis in anaerobic treatment s ystems was 
conducted through acetate and H 2&CO 2 utilization pathways. In the current study, the 
hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway was dominant throughout the whole blackwater 
treatment period. The values of SMA (H 2&CO 2) were always higher than SMA (ace tate) 
throughout the blackwater treatment process. Moreover, the feed sulfate change impacted the 
hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis but not the acetoclastic methanogenesis activity. From Phase I 
to II, the SMA (H 2&CO 2) value significantly increased from 0.37  (0.02) to 0.52 ( 0.00) g CH 4-
COD/g VSS/d after lowering the feed sulfate content; it then declined to 0.41 ( 0.01) g CH 4-
COD/g VSS/d when the sulfate was supplemented back in during Phase III. The SMA (acetate) 
values did not show considerable changes fr om Phase I to III, which ranged from 0.18 ( 0.06) to 
0.20 (0.00) g CH 4-COD/g VSS/d.  71 4.3.5 Microbial community analysis  
Microbial community diversity  
The temporal development of the microbial community  was analyzed using  the beta -diversity 
based on Bray -Curtis distance  to elucidate potential impacts from sulfate (Fig . S4.1). Both 
archaeal  and bacterial communities shifted from inoculum in Phase I, indicating the 
significant  impact from the substrate,  i.e., blackwater.  The archaeal  communities shifted 
drastically away from Phase I (tap water, high  feed sulfate) along  PCoA2 (20.6%)  axis in Phase 
II (DI water, low feed sulfate),  then shifted back towards Phase I with the supplementation of 
feed sulfate in Phase  III (tap water,  high feed sulfate).  Nevertheless, the bacterial 
communities  shifted along both  PCoA1 (63.7%) and PCoA2 (27.3%) axes after feed sulfate 
was lowered in  Phase II, then further shifted slightly away from all previous  phases along 
PCoA2 (27.3%) axis in Phase I II. 
Archaeal community variation  
A total of 17 archaeal taxa were detected at the genus level for inoculum and UASB samples for 
all studied operation conditions ( Fig. 4.3). Methanogens from the genus Methanolinea  (39.0%), 
two uncultured genera in the fami ly (f_) Methanospirillaceae  (38.1% and 13.7%) and the genus  
Methanoculleus  (6.5%) dominated more than 97% of the abundance in the inoculum. The genus 
Methanolinea  was then inherited from the inoculum and became the most dominant genera in 
Phase I with a re lative abundance of 63.1 %. The genus  Methanospirillum  (21.0 %) became the 
second -most dominant group. In addition, the genus Candidatus Methanoregula  and uncultured 
genera from the order Methanomicrobiales were enriched with relative abundances of 5.3% an d 
5.4%, respectively in Phase I.  
Interestingly, the dominant methanogen group was the genus Methanospirillum  (53.2%) after the 
feed sulfate concentration was lowered in Phase II, and the genus Methanolinea  (38.1%) became 
the second -most dominant. The rel ative abundances of methanogens from the genus  
Methanobacterium  and uncultured genera from the family Methanoregulaceae  increased to 3.0% 
and 2.1%, respectively, compared to that in the high -sulfate condition in Phase I. In Phase III, 
with the reinstating of the high -sulfate blackwater feed, the genus Methanolinea rehabilitated to 
be the most abundant archaeal group with a  relative abundance of 51.1%. Correspondingly, the  72 genus  Methanospirillum  decreased in relative abundance to a value of 38.0%. The genus  
Methanobacterium  and uncultured genus from the family Methanoregulaceae  showed slight 
increases in abundances to 3.7% a nd 4.7%, respectively.

the inoculum and the operation Phase I (tap water flush, high feed sulfate), Phase II (DI water 
flush, low f eed sulfate) and Phase III (tap water flush, high feed sulfate).  
 
The genus  Methanolinea  and genus Methanospirillum  have both been commonly found in 
anaerobic digesters treating waste such as biosolids and food -waste (Lee et al ., 2018; Swiatczak 
et al., 2017) . Both groups belong to the order Methanomicrobiales , and all members of this order 
have been reported as hydrogenotrophic methanogens that utilize H 2&CO 2 to produce CH 4 in 
bioreactors (Khan et al., 2018) . This correlates we ll with the high SMA (H 2&CO 2) values 
demonstrated in this study, indicating the hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated the system. 
The predominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway has been reported in both lab -
scale and full -scale bioreactors un der stable states, treating biosolids (Kim et a l., 2013)  and

Relative abundance (log)Color K ey 73 blackwater collected from vacuum toilets (Gao et al., 2019c) . The highest abundances of the 
genus Methanolinea in high -sulfate conditions (Phases I and III) were similar to th e previously 
reported observation that Methanolinea  dominated AD reactors at a sulfate concentration of 0.5 
mM (Ma et al., 2017) . The predominance of Methanolinea  in the current study may indicate that 
it may b e more resistant towards the high -sulfate conditions (~0.83 mM) than other 
methanogens. Species from genus Methanospirillum  have been commonly reported with higher 
H2 utilization rates (Ferry and Wolfe, 1977; Imachi et al., 2008) , which is consistent with the 
higher SMA (H 2&CO 2) observed in Phase II (low sulfate condition) in the present study. Further, 
it has been reported that the genus Methanospirillum  could function syntrophicall y to support 
SRB with the degradation of complex organics, such as aromatic and oil compounds (Ferry et al., 
1974; Ferry and Wolfe, 1976; Morris et al., 2013) . For example, an SRB strain 
(Desulfatibacillum alkeni vorans AK -01) from the family Desulfobacteraceae  was reported to be 
capable of degrading alkane with the presence of the genus Methanospirillum  in the absence of 
sulfate (Morris et al., 2013) . In the current study, the same family, Desulfobacte raceae  (0.2%) 
(Table S 4.3), was found in Phase II and may function syntrophically with methanogens 
Methanospirillum  for a better organics ’ removal.  
 
Bacterial community variation  
The results for relative bacterial abundances at the family level (or higher levels, i.e., order [o_], 
phylum [p_]) for inoculum and UASB operation (Phases I -III) are presented in Fig. 4.4. The 
inoculum was dominated by bacterial groups from the family [Cloacamonaceae]  (23.2%), 
uncultured family from order Bacteroidales (14.8%), and the families Rikenellaceae  (13.8%) 
Anaerolinaceae  (12.0%). The detected bacteri a have been commonly reported as fermenters for 
cellulose, nucleic acids, and fatty acids, etc. and degraders in digestion systems treating sewage 
sludge, agricultural waste, and food -waste, etc. (Graf, 2014; Lee et al., 2018; Swiatczak et al., 
2017; Wojcieszak et al., 2017) .  74 Fig. 4. 4. Heatmap of bacterial communities at family or higher level (order [o_]; phylum [p_]) in 
the inoculum and the operation Phase I (tap water flush, high feed sulfate), Phase II (DI water 
flush, low feed sulfate) and Phase III (tap water flush, high feed sulfate).  
The bacterial consortia shifted significantly when treating tap -water blackwater. In Phase I, the 
relative abundance of the bacterial family Rhodocyclaceae  drastically increased to 22.9% and 
became the most abundant group. The family Rhodocyclaceae , which is a group of hydrogen 
(H2) producing bacteria in sewage sludge digesters (Martínez et al., 2019) , is a bacterium family 
that has been reported to play an important role in degrading organic matter, especially aromatic

Relative abundance (log)Color K ey 75 substances (Xu et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2016) . The dominance of this bacterial group may 
indicate its stron g syntrophic relationship with H 2 consuming communities in the blackwater 
treatment system. An uncultured family from the order Bacteroidales  (9.2%) was inherited from 
the inoculum and was the second -most dominant in Phase I. The family Moraxellaceae , whic h 
had a relative abundance of 4.1%, has been reported in the human intestine and animal waste 
treatment systems, indicating its presence in blackwater (Lastovica et al., 2014; Pampillón -
González et al., 2017) . It should be noted that the family Syntrophaceae  (3.3%) has been 
demonstrated as a syntrophic fatty acid oxidizer which can cooperate with the methanogens fo r 
carbon processing in digesters (Ziels et al., 2019) .  
 
In Phase II, the family Rhodocyclaceae  (13.2%) remained the most abundant group. Three 
groups of bacteria from the family Comamonadaceae  (10.0%), an uncultured family from the 
order Clostridiales  (7.6%), and the family Clostridiaceae  (6.8%) were enriched, while an 
uncultured family from the order Bacteroidales (1.1%), the family Porphyromonadaceae  (1.7%), 
and the family Syntrophaceae  (1.9%) decreased in abundance. These enriched bacterial groups 
have been commonly reported in animal manure AD treatment systems and functioned as key 
fermenters for hydrolysis and acetogenesis (Kushkevych et al., 2019; Pampillón -González et al., 
2017; Sun et al., 2015) . Species in the family Clostridiaceae  have been reported as producing H 2 
during fermentation (Wüst et al., 2011) .  
 
In the final and third phase, the most d ominant bacterial group shifted to the family 
Clostridiaceae  (8.3%), and an uncultured family from the order Clostridiales and the family 
Comamonadaceae  remained dominant with relative abundances of 6.9% and 6.1%, respectively. 
The family Rhodocyclaceae  (3.7%) decreased in abundance, while increases were observed for 
bacteria groups from the family Anaerolinaceae  (6.5%), Veillonellaceae  (5.8%), and an 
uncultured family from order ASSO -13 (3.9%). These enriched bacteria have been widely 
reported as fermenter s capable of degrading various types of organic wastes (Zamanzadeh et al., 
2016) .  
 
No SRB was detected  in the inoculum , while enrichment of SRB was observed after treating tap 
water -flushed blackwater with high feed sulfate. In Phase I, the enriched SRB comprised the  76 families Desulfobulbaceae (2.5%), Desulfomicrobiaceae (2.4%), Desulfovibrionaceae (0.3%), 
and Desulfarculaceae  (0.1%), which had a total relative abundance of 5.4% of all enriched 
bacterium (Table S 4.3). The abundances of both the families Desulfobulbaceae  and 
Desulfomicrobiaceae  significantly decreased to 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, in Phase II when 
the feed sulfate concentration was lowered. A gradual recovery of SRB abundance with 
Desulfobulbaceae  (1.1%) and Desulfomicrobiaceae  (1.7%) was observed after sulfate was 
supplemented back in Phase III. Species from the overall dominant families Desulfobulbaceae  
and Desulfomicrobiaceae have been reported as mesophilic sulfate reducers that could utilize H 2 
as electron donors (Boylan et al., 2019; Kuever and Galushko, 2014; Zhuang et al., 2019) .  
 
4.4. Discussion  
To date, only limited studies have been reported on anaerobic treatment of conventional toilet 
blackwater (Abdel -Shafy et al., 2009; Bwapwa, 2012; Gallagher and Sharvelle, 2011; Gao et al., 
2019a; Luostarinen et al., 2007; Sharma et al., 2016; van Voorthuizen et al., 2008) . All studies 
reported low methanisation  rates (20 -29%), but no study systematically evaluated the potential 
inhibition factors. Although three studies reported the sulfate and sulfide values when treating 
this type of blackwater (Abdel -Shafy et al., 2009; Rose et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2016) , no 
investigation was performed to elucidate the impacts of flush water sulfate on conventional toilet 
blackwater biogas recovery.  
 
Sulfate inhibition has been widely reported in anaerobic wastewater treatment processes, where 
various types of carbon sources and electron donors have been well studied. For instance, carbon 
sources like acetate, ethanol, lactate and benzoate etc. from indus trial wastewater streams are 
commonly investigated (Bertolino et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2015; Li et al., 1996) , and the complex 
substrates like sewage sludge have also been studied where the fermentative intermediate 
products such as V FAs, amino acids, aromatic compounds etc. can all be utilized by SRB (Hao 
et al., 2014; Nagpal et al., 2000) . Bioreactor microbial communities have also been evaluated in 
these studies, where acetate utilizing sulfate reducers Desulfobacter  and the H 2 utilizing sulfate 
reducers Desulfovibrio  sp. were most commonly reported (Colleran et al., 1995) . However, most 
of the reported work on sulfate inhibition focused on relatively high feed sulfate  concentrations, 
i.e. from 0.5 g/L in starch wastewater (Lu et al., 2016)  to as high as 40 -50 g/L in oil refinery  77 wastewater (Colleran et al., 1995) , which were higher than the values (~80 mg/L) often observed 
in municipal wastewater (as discussed in the current work). Only limited studies focused on low 
feed sulfate conditions like the current work, y et effects of low -level sulfate on methanogenesis 
kinetics  have been reported . For instance, it has been observed in Lake Mendota sediments that 
methanogenesis was inhibited by the sulfate concentration as little as 0.2 mM (19.2 mg/L) 
(Winfrey and Zeikus, 1977) . Similarl y, sulfate concentrations of 60 -105 M (5.76 -10.08 mg/L) 
have been found to result in the reduction in methanogen activities in lake sediments (Lovley and 
Klug, 1983) . A recent reported study also demonstrated that different methanogenic consortia 
structure/composition reacted differently towards the level of sulfate and the carbon source 
(Chen et al., 2019) . It should be noted that the H 2S concentration in the UASB effluent  was low 
(2.6-9.8 mg/L ) under all conditions in the current work. Previous studies have demonstrated that 
the inhibitory concentration of H 2S towards methanogenic activities varies depending on the 
wastewater characteristics and methanogenic consortia involved  (Hilton and Oleszkiewicz, 1988; 
J.W.H. et al., 1994) . For instance, a wide range of 2 -615 mg/L H 2S in liquid phase has been 
reported to affect methanogens when treating sulfate -containing waste activated sludge  (Jeong et 
al., 2009) . The dynamic shift of the methanogenic commun ity and the lower hydrogenotrophic 
methanogenic activities (SMA [H 2&CO 2]) observed under higher sulfate conditions in this study 
may indicate an effectual competition conducted by SRB over the electron donor H 2, which 
conversely suppressed the methanogens’  substrate utilization rate.  
 
In addition to the substrate types, the sulfate inhibitory effects have been reported to correlate 
with the COD:SO 42- ratio (Li et al., 1996) . Lower COD:SO 42- ratios tend to intensify the 
competition for electron donors (Hulshoff Pol et al., 1998; Li et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016; Siles et 
al., 2010) , which could result in lower methane production. Our study clearly demonstrated the 
impact that sulfate in blackwater has on methane production, with a COD:SO 42- ratio of ~12, 
which is higher than commonly reported inhibition levels (1.5 – 10) (Li et al., 2015; Lu et al., 
2016; Siles et al., 2010) . For example, previous studies demonstrated that methanogenesis was 
inhibited when the COD:SO 42- ratio was lowered to 1.5 in pharmaceutical wa stewater treatment 
due to the increased sulfide concentration (Li et al., 2015) . Methane production was suppressed 
by 49% with the COD:SO 42- ratio decreased to equal or below 1.5 when treating antibiotic bio -
waste (Qiang et al., 2018) . The con version of COD to methane decreased from 80.5 % to 75.9 %  78 with the COD:SO 42- ratio changing from 20 to 10 when treating wastewater containing acetate 
and ethanol (Hu et al., 2015) . Similarly, the methane production rate decreased from 0.33 to 0 .31 
L CH 4/g COD when the COD:SO 42- ratio dropped from 20 to 10 in a sewage sludge treatment 
system (Jeong et al., 2009) . Process failure for methane production has been reported with a 
COD:SO 42- ratio lower than 10 (Hulshoff Pol et al., 2001) . However, it should be noted that 
operatio nal conditions, substrate/ carbon source type, and metabolic pathways may also play 
important roles when considering the impacts of COD:SO 42- ratio on anaerobic treatment 
(Cetecioglu et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2016) . For instance, a 60% decrease of methane production 
rate was ob served with a relatively high COD:SO 42- ratio of 11.6 in the treatment of waste 
activated sludge (Jeong et al., 2008) , while the rather low COD:S O42- ratios (0.5, 1.5, 5) showed 
no impact on the methane production when treating acetate and propionate in a sulfate 
acclimated reactor (Cetecioglu et al., 2019) . Moreover, in a hexadecane degradation process, the 
electron flow to SRB or methanogens was found determined by the initial sulfate concentration 
rather than the COD:SO 42- ratio  (Ma et al., 2017) .  
 
It has been reported that the sulfate reduction process can outcompete methanogenesis due to its 
kinetic and thermodynamic favorability  (Ueki et al., 1992) . The current study has demonstrated a 
hydrogen consuming pathway with H 2 as electron donors. It has been commonly reported that 
hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be out competed by SRB (Chen et al., 2008; Oremland and 
Taylor, 1978)  because SRB has a lower required hydrogen threshold concentration and a high 
hydrogen affinity (Laanbroek et al., 1984) , whilst demonstrating thermodynamic favourability 
with methanogenesis in hydrogenotrophic pathways: 𝐶𝑂 2+4𝐻2→𝐶𝐻 4+2𝐻2𝑂, G0= -135.6 
kJ/mol and sulfate reduction: 𝑆𝑂42−+4𝐻2+𝐻+→𝐻𝑆−+4𝐻2𝑂, G0= -151.9 kJ/mol (the 
produced HS - and H 2S was dependent on pH as shown in section 4. 2.5) (McCartney and 
Oleszkiewicz, 1991) . Previous studies detected that nea rly all the H 2 oxidation was attributed to 
SRB instead of methanogens in reactors treating wastewater with sulfates (Chen et al., 2008) , 
which could support the ascendancy of H 2 oxidizing SRB over hydrogenotrophic methanogens. 
Observations of inhibited methanogenesis have been reported in the literature; for instance, Ma 
et al. (2017)  observed lower methanogenic activity with sulfate addition in a hydrogenotrophic 
methano genic -dominated system. Jing et al. (2013)  also reported a decreased SMA (H 2&CO 2) 
from 0.192 to 0.095 with sulfate addition in the treatment of synthetic sulfate -containing  79 wastewater. Similarly, Weijma et al. (2002)  observed that sulfate reduction completely 
outcompeted methane product ion in a gas -lift reactor treating H 2&CO 2 and sulfate. These studies 
correlated well with our results that suppressed SMA (H 2&CO 2) values were obtained under high 
sulfate concentration conditions.  
 
It is also important to note that the presence of SRB may result in significant impacts on the 
anaerobic environment. In marine sediments, it has been reported that in sulfate -rich condition, 
SRB and methanogens competed for substrates, while in sulfate -depleted conditions, they 
complemented each other for organi c degradation (Plugge et al., 2011) . This correlates well with 
the current blackwater treatment results that indicated that the absence of flushing water sulfate 
led to an enhanced COD biodegradation and enrichment of methanogens with higher substrate 
utilization rates. With the release from feed sulfate toxicity, organic  matter biodegradation and 
methanogenesis were both facilitated with heightened biodegradation of organics ( i.e., higher 
COD removal efficiency, lower COD accumulation) and better biomethane recovery efficiency. 
Therefore, the present study demonstrated th at the high sulfate concentration in blackwater 
generated toxic impacts in not only the electron donor competition between SRB and 
methanogens but also the inhibition of the methanogenesis process by altering methanogenic 
consortia and suppressing their ac tivities.  
 
4.5. Conclusions  
This study showed that conventional toilet flushed blackwater can be effectively treated under 
anaerobic condition using an UASB reactor at 35 °C, a COD removal efficiency of >80% was 
achieved with an HRT 2.2 d ays and an OLR 0.4 5 kg COD/m 3/d. The tap water flushed 
blackwater with a sulfate concentration of 79.9 ( 4.7) mg/L negatively impacted the 
methanogenesis, with a low methane production rate of 58.0 ( 6.9) mL/L/d, and the removal of 
flush water sulfate resulted in a higher m ethane production rate of 73.5 ( 2.8) mL/L/d. 
Hydrogenotrophic methanogens and hydrogen utilizing SRB were enriched in the blackwater 
treatment processes, whereas the change of feed sulfate concentration resulted in the variation in 
microbial communities. Advantageous methanogens with higher substrate utilization rates from 
the genus Methanospirillum  dominated the archaeal population under low feed sulfate 
concentrations while Methanolinea was the most abundant archaeal genus under high feed  80 sulfate conditi ons. Subsequently, an increase in SMA (H 2&CO 2) from 0.37 ( 0.02) g CH 4-
COD/g VSS/d (high feed sulfate condition) to 0.52 ( 0.00) g CH 4-COD/g VSS/d (low feed 
sulfate condition) was observed.  
 
Overall, this work demonstrated the impact of sulfate concentration on blackwater biomethane 
recovery. Studies may be required to assess methane recovery efficiency and biogas quality in 
future practical applications.  
 
4.6 Supplementary materials  
4.6.1 Wa stewater properties  
Feces and urine accounted for the majority of major ions and metals in feed, thus the source of 
the flushing water ( i.e., tap vs. DI water) had little impact on such concentrations (See Tables 
S4.1 & S 4.2). Similarly, nutrient component s NH 4+-N ranged from 107.5 (±3.2) mg/L to 113.6 
(±2.8) mg/L, and TP ranged from 17.5 (±4.9) mg/L to 21.6 (±6.5) mg/L (Table 4.1) were 
comparable in tap and DI -water blackwater, indicating their major origination was from human 
excreta. The TSS and VSS conc entrations in all operational phases were mostly correlated with 
the natural properties of feces and urine collected with values ranged 0.32 (±0.1) - 0.43 (±0.06) 
g/L and 0.29 (±0. 09)- 0.42 (±0.07) g/L, respectively (Table 4.1). pH values were similar withi n a 
range of 7.7 (±0.1) - 7.9 (±0.1) with different flushing water used.

3 A version of this chapter has been published: Gao, M., Zhang, L., Guo, B., Zhang, Y., Liu, Y., 2019c. Enhancing 
biomethane  recovery  from  source-diverted  bla ckwater  through  hydrogenotrophic  methanogenesis  dominant 
pathway. Chem. Eng. J. 378, 122258. 92 To maximize energy recovery from source -separated wastewater treatment and to enable more 
effective resource management from blackwater, optimization of the blackwater treatment 
processes through redu cing the potential process inhibition is essential. Therefore, the current 
study challenged the maximum organic loading rate (OLR) for anaerobically treating vacuum 
toilet collected blackwater using an UASB reactor operated under mesophilic condition (35 ° C) 
and acclimatized the microbial community by gradually increasing the OLR. UASB was selected 
based on its prove n effectiveness in blackwater treatment (De Graaff et al., 2010) , and its 
capability of treating  high strength wastewater at high organic loading conditions (Rico et al., 
2015) . For the first time, microbial communities involved in the biodegradation processes and 
the microbial structure development through the various OLR conditions were evaluated. 
Correspondingly, the dominated methanogenic pathways throughout long -term (~304 days) 
operation were identified.  
5.2. Methods and materials  
5.2.1 Feedstock and reactor operation  
Vacuum toilet collected blackwater (1 L flushing water per flush) used in this study was obtained 
from the University of Alberta campus (Edmonton, Canada) weekly  over a two -day collection 
period , and stored at 4 °C until use. Raw blackwater was filled into a continuously stirred 
influent storage tank (storage time of 0.5 d) under room temperature condition (20 °C). 
Blackwater in the influent storage tank (UASB influent) was then pumped into a 5 L (working 
volume 4.7 L) upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor ( Fig. S5.1) with a peristaltic 
pump (Longer pump BT 100 -2J).   
The UASB reactor was operated at 35 °C with a heating blanket. The reactor inoculum at the 
beginning of the reactor operation was obtained from an anaerobic digester treating primary 
sludge at a local wastewater treatment plant. The produced biogas was collected with gas bags at 
the to p of the reactor. The effluent was sampled from the top side ports of the reactor and was 
further characterized. The sludge bed height inside the UASB reactor was monitored throughout 
the reactor operation period to calculate the sludge volume inside the r eactor. Reactor operational 
conditions are shown in Table 5.1. The OLRs were increased through increasing the influent  93 flow rate. Reactor operation lasted for 304 days, which is divided into seven Phases (from Phase 
I to VII), with varying OLR (0.28 -4.87 k g COD/m 3/d) and HRT (2.08 -36.42 days).  
  
The steady state for each operation condition (OLR) was indicated by relatively stabilized COD 
removal efficiencies, methane productions and effluent properties obtained. The steady state was 
counted at least one we ek after each OLR change, and the steady state durations for each 
operation Phase lasted differently from 21 to 51 days, respectively.

5.2.2 Batch assays  
Biological methane potential (BMP) test for blackwater  
The BMP test in this study was performed to evaluate the maximum amount of methane that can 
be produced from the influent blackwater, and is expressed as the ratio of feed blackwater COD 
that can be converted to methane COD ( g CH 4-COD/g influent COD t). BMP  tests followed 
previously reported procedures (Gao et al., 2019) . All tests were conducted in triplicates.   
 
Specific methanogenic activity (SMA) and stability test for UASB sludge  
The batch assays were performed to determine specific methanogenic activity (SMA) and sludge 
stability of the anaerobic sludge accumulated in the UASB reactor sludge bed under all operation 
Phases. For each assay, UASB sludge was collected from all side ports, mixed and characterized 
for COD concentration, total suspended solids (TSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS)  
concentrations before the batch experiments.  
 94 SMA represents the maximum methane production rate that the sludge can perform, and t he 
results were expressed as g CH 4-COD/g sludge VSS /d in this study. For each group of SMA 
tests, batch serum bottles were filled with UASB mixed sludge and substrate (sodium acetate or 
H2&CO 2). When acetate was applied, the initial substrate COD concentra tion was 1 g/L. The 
headspace of the serum bottles was flushed with nitrogen gas to achieve anaerobic conditions. 
When H 2&CO 2 was applied as substrate, a ratio of 80%/20% of H 2/CO 2 content was applied to 
flush the headspace of the test bottles. After flush ed with gases, the bottles were then sealed with 
rubber septums and aluminum caps, incubated at 35 °C, and shaken at 130 rpm in the dark with 
an incubator shaker (New Brunswick™ Innova® 44, Eppendorf, Canada). Measurements of 
methane production were achiev ed through the measurement of headspace pressure using a 
pressure meter (GHM 3151, Germany) and the composition of biogas using gas chromatography 
(GC) (7890B Agilent Technologies, USA) . SMA tests were performed in triplicates under steady 
state conditions  of each operation Phase. The SMA values were calculated  from dividing the  
initial  linear slope of the methane production curve over the sludge VSS in each bottle.  Blank 
control s with only sludge were set-up simultaneously to subtract the methane production from 
sludge in the test group. The SMA (acetate and H2 & CO 2) results were presented with average 
values of the triplicate s as g CH 4-COD/g sludge VSS/d  with standard deviations  in each 
operational Phase .  
The sludge stability test was conducted using serum bottles with UASB mixed sludge at 35 °C. 
The set -up procedure for the sludge stability test was the same as that described in the BMP 
batch test. Methane production was monitored, and stability tests wer e stopped when no more 
methane production can be detected.  Sludge stability tests evaluate the amount of biodegradable 
substrate present in the sludge and are expressed as g CH 4-COD/g sludge COD . Higher values 
indicate more biodegradable organics present in sludge, which represent s less sludge stability.  
5.2.3 DNA extraction and sequence analysis  
Inoculum and  the UASB sludge collected at the end of each operation Phase (Table 5.1) were 
used for genomic DNA extraction. 1.5 mL of each sludge sample was first centrifuged at 3,000 g 
for 10 min. The pellet was used for DNA extraction with DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, 
Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. All DNA samples were extracted with 95 fresh sludge samples in duplicates. The quality of DNA samples was checked through NanoDrop 
One (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and the DNA samples were stored at -20 °C until 
downstream analysis was performed. PCR was performed followed by the sequencing 
experiment on the Illumina MiSeq platform. 16S rRNA genes of the representative clones were 
sequenced to determine bacteria and archaea communities by RTL Genomics (Tex as, USA) . 
Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified using the universal primer -pair 357wF  
(CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG ) and 785R  (GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC ).  Archaeal 16S 
rRNA genes were amplified using universal primer set 517F  (GCYTAAAGSRNCCGTAGC ) and 
909R  (TTTCAGYCTTGCGRCCGTAC ).  
The raw sequences were processed using Qiime2 pipelines (Caporaso et al., 2010)  DADA2 
algorithm (Callahan et al., 2016) , with the paired -end reads data of forward and reverse 
sequences achieved, and the low -quality sequences and chimeras removed. Taxonomy was 
assigned using 97% similarity in GreenGenes (version 13_8) r eference database (McDonald et 
al., 2012; Werner et al., 2012) . 
5.2.4 Sampling and  analysis  
The wastewater characteristics including tota l COD (COD t), suspended COD (COD ss), colloidal 
COD (COD col), soluble COD (COD s), total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids 
(VSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), total phosphorous (TP), 
reactive phosphorous (PO 43--P), volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and pH were routinely measured. All 
COD, TSS, VSS, and TDS measurements followed the procedure described in the standard 
methods from American Public Health Association (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012) . TAN, TP, and 
PO 43--P were measured using Hach TNT vial tests (Hach, USA). Volatile fatty acids including 
acetate, propionate, and butyrate were measured using Ionic chromatography (IC) (DIONEX 
ICS-2100, ThermoFisher, USA). pH was measured with B40PCID pH meter (VWR, 
SympHon y). The characterization of raw blackwater, UASB influent and UASB effluent was 
conducted three to five times a week depending on the reactor operation Phase and performance. 
Raw blackwater characterization was performed immediately after fresh blackwater preparation, 
and the UASB influent was characterized after 0.5 -day storage in the blackwater influent tank 
(Section 5.6 ). The UASB influent characteristics shown were the results of average values 96 adopted for each operation Phase ( Fig. 5.1A, error bars rep resent one standard deviation) and for 
the whole operation duration (Table 5.2), respectively.  Characterization of UASB wasted sludge 
including COD, TSS, VSS, TAN, TP, and pH were conducted one to two times in each operation 
Phase with methods described ab ove. The results of sludge TSS and VSS concentrations were 
presented as average values obtained (error bars represent one standard deviation) from all 
measurements counted within each operation Phase.  Biogas production amount was measured 
daily through the  gas bag collection. The concentration of methane and carbon dioxide were 
measured through GC (7890B Agilent Technologies, USA) . 
5.2.5 Calculations  
All the calculations for average values and standard deviations of the COD mass balance, 
hydrolysis efficie ncies, methane production rate s and methanisation rates were obtained from the 
steady state data.  
Solids retention time (SRT)  
The theoretical SRT in different operation Phases were calculated based on the VSS 
concentration inside the UASB reactor and the amount of solids discharged and washed out (in 
VSS) from the reactor effluent. When the theoretical calculated SRT was longer t han the 
operation duration, the operation duration was used as the operational SRT (Metcalf and Eddy, 
2003) .  
COD mass balance  
In each stable operation Phase, COD mass balance was de termined, which assumes that the 
amount of influent COD was partitioned into: COD for methane production, COD accumulation 
in sludge bed (including discharged sludge and reactor sludge bed), and effluent COD. The COD 
balances were calculated from steady st ate COD loads and distributions (Wendland et al., 2007) . 
Methanogenic capacity  
The methanogenic capacity of the UASB reactor was calculated based on the SMA of the sludge 
and the amount of VSS in the reactor. The reactor methanogenic capacity w as calculated by 97 multiplying each SMA (H 2/CO 2) value obtained (2.2.2) by its corresponding VSS in UASB, and 
presented with average values (and standard deviations) adopted within each operation Phase. 
The methanogenic capacity of each operation Phase was c ompared with the detected methane 
production and the total feedstock input.  
Solids COD hydrolysis efficiency  
The solids COD hydrolysis efficiency refers to the percentage of hydrolyzed solids COD fraction 
of the influent blackwater, the influent solids CO D refers to the sum of COD ss and COD col, 
which is defined as COD solids in the present study. The hydrolysis efficiency of COD solids can be 
determined through the following equation (De Graaff et al., 2010) :

Methane production  
Methane  production rate  
Methane production rate  shows the net amount of methane generated from the reactor daily, and 
represented as m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d. 
Methanisation rate  
The methanisation rate indicates the amount of methane (as COD ) that converted from the 
influent blackwater COD, represented as g CH 4-COD/g influent COD t.  
5.2.6 Statistical analysis  
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)  was performed using Microsoft Excel®  on 
comparisons of COD concentrations between  raw blackwater  and the UASB influent , and COD 
removal efficiencies between different operation Phases . A p -value less than 0.05 was considered 
statistically different.

The average compositions of the UASB influent and the UASB effluent through the whole 
operational period are shown in Table 5.2. Raw vacuum toilet flushed blackwater has a pH of 
8.62 (±0.06), COD t of 9,985 (±714) mg/L and NH 4+-N concentration of 1,115.1 (± 78.9) mg/L 
and the fraction of COD ss, COD col and COD s accounted for 61%, 7%, and 33% of blackwater 
COD t, respectively (Table S 5.1).    
 
Compared to the raw blackwater, the UASB influent (after 0.5 d storage in the influent tank) has 
similar COD concentrati ons (p  >0.05), higher VFA (~15% increase in acetate and propionate and 
~18% increase in butyrate), and lower pH, which is attributed to the blackwater storage in the 
influent tank (blackwater feed storage time optimization is shown in  section 5.6 ).  As a r esult of  99 VFA increase and the associated pH decrease (pH dropped from 8.62 to 8.05), blackwater free 
ammonia concentration was reduced from the initial 431.3 (±44.5) mg/L to 154.6 (±86.4) mg/L, 
which helps to reduce free ammonia inhibition on blackwater di gestion (Gao et al., 2019) .  
 
5.3.2 Performance of the UASB reactor  
Fig. 5.1 shows the influent and effluent COD t concentration and the methane production in 
various operation Phases with different HRT and OLR. One week after the reactor start -up, 
COD t removal of ~80% and methanisation rate of 0.43 g CH 4-COD/g influent COD t were 
achieved. After two weeks of operation , an average COD t removal reached 87.0% (±0.8%), and 
the reactor operation was stable for the rest of the reactor start -up Phase. The change of HRT and 
OLR did not significantly impact COD t removal in the first three operation Phases. In Phase II 
(OLR=0.48  kg COD/m 3/d) and III (OLR=0.81 kg COD/m 3/d), COD t removal efficiency was 
90.4% (±1.1%) and 87.3% (±4.1%), respectively. The COD t removal efficiency started to 
decrease in Phase IV (OLR=1.64 kg COD/m 3/d), with an average of 83.5% (±3.8%) COD t 
removal. Slud ge wash -out was observed in this Phase, which led to an increase in effluent COD 
concentration from 1,175 (±106) mg/L (Phase III) to 1,598 (±374) mg/L (Phase IV) (Table 5.2). 
The COD t removal efficiency was maintained at 85.0% (±3.9%) in Phase V (OLR=3.09 kg 
COD/m 3/d), which was then decreased to 81.4% (±4.4%) and 83.6% (±4.9%) respectively in the 
final two Phases with the high OLR (Phase VI 4.87 kg COD/m 3/d and Phase VII 4.07 kg 
COD/m 3/d, respectively) conditions. A substantial sludge wash -out was observed  in Phase VI 
and the beginning of phase VII, which led to a poor effluent quality with an average COD 
concentration of 1,809 (±511) mg/L (Phase VI) (Table 5.2). The effluent quality recovered after 
the OLR decreased to 4.07 kg COD/m 3/d in Phase VII.   100

C 101 During the first five Phases (Phases I -V with OLR=0.28 -3.09 kg COD/m 3/d), reactor operation 
was stable. As shown in Fig. 5.1, the methanisation rate ranged from 0.41 to 0.48 g CH 4-COD/g 
influent COD t, which was comparable to the feedstock BMP values (0.48 g CH 4-COD/g influent 
COD t, section 5.6 ), indicating effective methanoge nesis with no free ammonia inhibition  inside 
the UASB reactor . The methane production rate  increased from 0.05 (±0.00) to 0.49 (±0.07) m3 
CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d (Phases I -V). The influent COD s removal ranging from 76.7% (±3.9%) to 
84.6% (±0.3%), COD col removal ranging from 49.0% (±20.3%) to 73.0% (±4.6%), and COD ss 
removal ranging from 84.4% (±5.4%) to 97.1% (±1.0%) were achieved (Table 5.2). Further, as 
shown in Fig. 5.2, COD solids hydrolysis efficiency was stable, ranging from 29.5% (±5.2%) to 
33.2% (±5.0%). However, when the influent OLR was further increased to 4.87 kg COD/m 3/d in 
Phase VI (HRT=2.08 days), significant sludge loss was observed, leading to a lowered 
theoretical SRT , which might also contribute to the the insufficient hydrolysis of COD solids, 
suspended COD accumulation in the reactor, and subsequent reduction in the substrate 
methanisation rate, as demonstrated in Fig. 5.2. Similar observation s have been reported 
previously (De Graaff et al., 2010; Wendland et al., 2007) . As shown in Fig. 5.1 and Fig. 5. 2, the 
methanisation rate dropped to 0.35 g CH 4-COD/g influent COD t with methane production rate  of 
0.60 (±0.11) m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d, and the COD solids hydrolysis efficiency was significantly 
reduced to 16.8% (±3.4%) . The influent COD col removal was found decreased to 17.1% (±3.9%); 
while the removal of average influent COD s (77.7%±2.8%), and COD ss (90.7%±4.5%) were not 
significantly affected compared with previous operational Phases (p >0.05). In the last Phase, 
OLR was decreased to 4.07  kg COD/m 3/d and the HRT was increased to 2.6 days. With a 
reduced organic loading rate, it was observed that the COD solids hydrolysis efficiency recovered 
back to 28.7% (±2.5%) ( Fig. 5.2) and COD col removal increased back to 63.4% (±7.5%) (Table 
5.2). Thi s observation correlates to the increase in the total COD reduction (84%), and the 
methanisation rate of 0.44 (±0.04) g CH 4-COD/g influent COD t with methane production rate  of 
0.68 (±0.08 ) m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d (Fig. 5.1), indicating a successful system recovery.   102  
Fig. 5.2. The influent COD solids hydrolysis efficiency of UASB reactor treating vacuum toilet 
blackwater at different organic loading rates (OLR). Error bars represent one standard deviation. 
 The three main volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations in the effluent of the UASB reactor 
through the whole operational period were monitored, and the results are shown in Fig. 5.3. Soon 
after the reactor start -up, total effluent VFA concentrations decreased to below 200 mg/L and 
were kept at a low level throughout the operational time. The effluent total VFA concentration of 
66.1 (±33) mg COD/L observed in this study was within the range of commonly reported 
anaerobic digestion effluent VFA values (20 -150 mg COD/L) for treating high strength 
blackwater (De Graaff et al., 2010; Tervahauta et al., 2014; Wendland et al., 2007). The observed 
low VFA concentration correlated well with the effective methane production observed in this 
study, suggesting that the pro duced VFA from the fermentation step can be utilized effectively 
by methanogens, and methanogenesis was not the limiting step in this treatment system (Murto 
et al., 2004) . Increases of the VFA concentrations (mainly acetate) were occasionally observed, 
which were often accompanied by either a sudden increase in organic loading rates or sludge 
wash -out f rom the reactor. Nevertheless, our detected total VFA concentrations were always 
below VFA inhibition thresholds reported in blackwater treatments (e.g. 590-2,600 mg/L (De 
Graaff et al., 2010; Wendland et al., 2007)).  
 
As shown in Table 5.2, along with the COD
t removal, relatively high TSS  removal efficiencies 
of 95.1% (±3.2%)- 98% (±0.9%) were achieved in Phase I-V (OLR=0.28-3.09 kg COD/m 3/d). 
 103 The amount of effluent TSS increased under high OLR condition in Phase VI (OLR=4.87 kg 
COD/m 3/d), which may be attributed to sludge wash out, leadin g to decreased TSS removal 
efficiency (86.1%). The TSS removal started to recover in Phase VII (90.7%) with a lower OLR 
4.07 kg COD/m 3/d applied. The overall high solids removal efficiency may be attributed to the 
UASB sludge bed, which not only provided m icroorganisms for biodegradation, but also enabled 
solids entrapment. The UASB effluent pH was maintained at 7.87 (±0.19), which was similar to 
the reported values in literature (De Graaff et al., 2010) . Extra  ammonium was released during 
the digestion process with a slight increase in effluent NH 4+-N (~1,218 mg/L in effluent, as 
compared to ~1,137 mg/L in influent) observed, which can be explained by the hydrolysis of 
blackwater protein content. As a result, t he free ammonia concentration was 115 mg/L, which 
was lower than the blackwater free ammonia inhibition level reported previously (Gao et al., 
2019) .

Fig. 5.4. COD mass balance of UASB reactor treating vacuum toilet blackwater at different 
organic loading rates (OLR), the partition of influent COD considered includes COD 
accumulation in sludge (sludge bed and discharged sludge), COD for methane production and 
effluent COD. Error bars represent one standard deviation.  The COD mass balance of the UASB reactor is displayed in Fig. 5.4. The partition of the influent 
COD
t includes (i) COD t converted to methane, (ii) retained in sludge bed and discharged sludge, 
and (iii) COD in UASB effluent. As shown in Fig. 5.4, the sum of the detected COD counted for 
92-114% of the total input COD, indicating satisfactory development of COD balance (Zhang et al., 2018). From Phases I-V (OLR=0.28-3.09 kg COD/m
3/d), with relatively high and stable 
COD t removal (average 87%), the effluent COD only accounted for ~13% of influent COD t, the 
methane production accounted for ~43% of influent COD t, and the COD accumulation in sludge 
(wasted and accumulated) accounted for ~ 43%. Compared to the first five Phases, the amount of 
COD distributed in methane production decreased to 35%, along with the increased effluent 
COD of 19% and accumulated COD of 47% in Phase VI (OLR=4.87 kg COD/m 3/d), which, as 
discussed above, can be attributed to the reduced solids substrate hydrolysis efficiency in this 
Phase. In Phase VII, with a reduction in OLR to 4.07 kg COD/m 3/d, methane COD production 
increased to 44%, together with a decreased COD accumulation in sludge of 39%, and a reduced 
COD in reactor effluent (16%), suggesting a stable and satisfactory reactor operation.  
 105 5.3.4 Sl udge bed development  
The sludge TSS, VSS, VSS/TSS ratio, SMA and methanogenic capacity in various operation 
Phases are shown in Fig. 5.5. The sludge TSS and VSS concentrations ( Fig. 5.5A) increased 
from the initial inoculum 20.7 (±0.9) g/L and 13.1 (±0.6)  g/L, to 43.5 (±4.1) and 34 (±3.5) g/L in 
Phase V (OLR=3.09 kg COD/m 3/d), respectively. TSS and VSS further increased to 48.1 (±4.8) 
g/L and 37.5 (±3.1) g/L respectively, in Phase VI (OLR=4.87 kg COD/m 3/d), which may be 
explained by the COD ss accumulation in the sludge bed. The VSS/TSS ratio was high at 0.7 3-
0.82 through the whole operation period, indicating the high organic contents.  
 
Further, as shown in Fig. 5.5B, SMA values obtained from  acetate or H 2&CO 2 were  significantly 
different throughout the reactor operation. Overall, SMA (H 2&CO 2) was greater than SMA 
(acetate), indicating the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activi ties. SMA 
(H2&CO 2) increased from 0.34 (±0.01) g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d in Phase I (OLR=0.28 kg 
COD/m 3/d) to 0.49 (±0.01) g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d in Phase V (OLR=3.09 kg COD/m 3/d). SMA 
(H2/CO 2) reduced to 0.34 (±0.01) g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d under high loading conditions in Phase 
VI (OLR=4.87 kg COD/m 3/d) and 0.35 (±0.03) g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d in Phase VII (OLR=4.07 
kg COD/m 3/d). The decreased SMA (H2&CO 2) in phase VI can be attributed to the decreased 
substrate hydrolysis efficiency that led to higher amount of organics accumulated in sludge bed 
(with increased sludge VSS). In comparison, SMA (acetate) values were maintained in the range 
of 0.1 -0.11 g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d in Phases I -IV (OLR=0.28 -1.64 kg COD/m 3/d), which was 
then increased to 0.18 (±0.01) g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d in Phase V. Further SMA (acetate) increases 
in Phase VI (0.27 (±0.04) g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d) and VII (0.23 (±0.05) g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d) 
were obser ved, which may be attributed to the enhancement in syntrophic acetate oxidation 
(SAO) pathway with increased OLR that provided more readily available substrates as compared 
to the first four Phases.   106

C 107 Further, as shown in Fig. 5.5C, the methanogenic capacity varied from 2.98 (±0.5) kg CH 4-
COD/m 3/d in Phase I to 7.07 (±0.5) kg CH 4-COD/m 3/d in Phase VII. The methanogenic capacity 
was the highest in Phase V (9.76 (±0.5) kg CH 4-COD/m 3/d) with an OLR of 3.09 kg COD/m 3/d. 
The relatively high methanogenic capacity observed in this Phase can be attributed to the 
relatively high SMA (H 2&CO 2) (0.49)  achieved and the high VSS in the reactor that was capable 
to be maintained in the system when compared with higher OLR conditions (OLR=4.87 and 4.07 
kg COD/m 3/d). As compared to Phase V, the decreased methanogenic capacity of 6.25 (±0.4) kg 
CH 4-COD/m 3/d in Phase VI was due to the reduced sludge SMA (H 2&CO 2) and the reduced 
sludge bed volume, which started to recover with the lower  OLR applied in Phase VII.  
Throughout the operation, all the applied OLRs never reached the reactor methanogenic 
capacity. This was also verified by the fact of no VFA accumulation in the UASB effluent.  
 
5.3.5 Microbial community analysis  
Bacterial community structure  
The results of the relative abundance of bacterial communities in inoculum, and UASB reactor 
Phase I, III, IV, and  VII (OLR = 0.28, 0.81, 1.64 and 4.07 kg COD/m 3/d, respectively) are 
presented in Fig. 5.6. The given groups were at least with 1% relative abundance in the whole 
community structure. Overall, the bacteria l domain was diverse under all investigated conditions 
and can be assigned to 12 phyla . The predominant phyla in the inoculum included Bacteroidetes 
(34.5%), Cloacimonetes (23.2%), Chloroflexi (12.5%) and Proteobacteria (9.5%), while the 
dominant phyla were  shifted to Bacteroidetes (26.4 -45.7%), Firmicutes (22.3 -31.3%) and 
Proteobacteria (5.0 -26.5%) in the backwater UASB . In particular, after a slight decrease in Phase 
I, the abundance of Bacteroidetes increased to 33.0% (Phase III), 45.7% (Phase IV) and 41. 2% 
(Phase VII) with increasing OLR, and became the most dominant group in these Phases. It has 
been reported that phyla Bacteroidetes contain hydrolysis/fermentative bacteria  that convert 
carbohydrates and proteins into acids (Kampmann et al., 2012) , which have been found to 
dominate in anaerobic systems treating carbon rich substrates, e.g., food wastes (Lim et al., 
2013) . Further, phyla Firmicutes was also drastically enriched in the UASB reactor and was 
shown to be the second predominant phyla (22.3 -31.3%) in the whole blackwater treatment 
period. Phyla Firmicutes has been reported to produce extracellular enzymes (e.g., proteases, 
lipases and cell ulases) for the hydrolysis of protein, lipids and carbohydrates, and assist in acid  108 production in the fermentation process (Lim et al., 2013) . Both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes 
have been f ound in the human gut and rumen (Kampmann et al., 2012) , which may explain their 
origin and enrichment in the UASB reactor. The relative abundance of phyla Cloacimonetes and 
Chloroflexi decreased to 3.0 -6.4% and 2.6 -6.0%, respectively, in the reactor. The abundance of 
phyla Proteobacteria was enriched in Phase I (26.5%), but then decreased to 5.0 -8.7% at higher 
OLR conditions. Phyla Proteobacteria was reported with cellulolytic activity and is capable in 
degrading va rious types of carbohydrates and proteins (Cardinali -Rezende et al., 2011) . Our 
current results demonstrate that phyla Proteobacteria w as more preferable under low OLR 
conditions. A similar observation has been reported previously (Gao et al., 2019) . 
 
Community shifts at the genus level were also observed. The genus Blvii28 wastewater -sludge 
group  (13.8%), Candidatus Cloacimonas  (13.4%), uncultured genus from family 
Anaerolineaceae  (9.7%) and uncultured genus from order Cloacimonadales (8.7%) contributed 
most in the inoculum. However, none of these genera were enriched in the blackwater reactor. 
Blvii28 wastewater -sludge group and Candidatus Cloacimonas  were both reported as mesophilic 
acetogens in sewage sludge anaerobic digestion syste ms (Lee et al., 2018) . The dominant genus 
included Koukoulia  (21.7%), unknown genus from order Cloacimonadales (4.3%) and 
Bacteroides (4.2%) in Phase I;  genus Fibrobacter  (14.5%), uncultured genus from family 
Clostridiales vadinBB60 group  (12.4%), and Bacteroides (6.1%) in Phase III; Bacteroides 
(21.2%), Erysipelotrichaceae UCG -004 (7.8%) and Fibrobacter  (6.5%) in Phase IV and 
Bacteroides (28.3%) in Phase  VII. Overall, genus Bacteroides  was found to be predominant 
under relatively high OLR conditions, demonstrating its robustness under such conditions . 
Previous studies showed that genus Bacteroides  often inhabit the human intestine and function in 
carbohyd rate transportation and protein metabolism (Karlsson et al., 2011) . Further, Fibrobacter  
in Phase III (HRT 12 days, OLR 0.81 kg COD/m 3/d) has been reported to be essential for 
cellulose hydrolysis and are often foun d in herbivore gut (McDonald et al., 2009) .   109

Phases I, III, IV, and VII (OLR=0.28, 0.81, 1.64 and 4.07 kg COD/m 3/d, respectively) are 
presented in Fig. 5.7. The given groups contribute to at least 1% relative abundance in the 
community. Overall, more than  97% of the detected methanogens can be assigned to 
hydrogenotrophic methanogens in both inoculum and the UASB reactor. In the inoculum, the 
predominant methanogens were genus Methanospirillum  (52.7%), Methanolinea (38.2%), and 
Methanoculleus  (6.3%). In Ph ase I, the dominant methanogen groups were similar to those in the 
inoculum, including Methanolinea (49.6%), Methanospirillum  (37.2%), and Methanoculleus  
(9.3%). The methanogenic species shifted significantly in Phases III, IV, and VII, with a

abundance of genus Methanolinea  (19.9 -33.7%), and a significantly reduced abundance of

Methanolinea , and Methanospirillum , which were all belong to the order Methanomicrobiales . 
Order Methanomicrobiales , as hydrogenotrophic methanogens,  is commonly found in anaerobic 
digestion systems. The dominance of Methanomicrobiales  in anaerobic reactors was correlated 
to the high ammonia concentration in previous studies (Werner et al., 2014) . Genus 
Methanolinea was found in anaerobic reactors treating sewage sludge, and has been reported to 
metabolize H 2 or formate for growth and methane production (Imachi et al., 2008) , and is able t o 
couple with syntrophic oxidation (Wilkins et a l., 2015) . Genus Methanospirillum  was found in 
an anaerobic system treating high -solids sewage sludge, and was reported to be strictly 
mesophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogen (Liu et al., 2016) . Methanoculleus have been found to 
dominant in a liquid swine manure fed digester (Barret et al., 2013) . As hydrogenotrophic 
methanogens, genus Methanoculleus  has been reported tolerant to high ammonia concentrations 
(FA 1.1 g/L) in a thin stillage fed reactor (Moestedt et al., 2016) . Further, genus  Methanogenium  
was found in rural household digesters (Han et al., 2018)  and in swine manure digestion systems 
(Qin et al., 2013) . However, the studies of genera Methanogenium  are still limited in anaerobic 
digestion systems.  
 
Overall, with increases in the organic loading and methane production rate , bacterial and 
archaeal communities shifted. Under high OLR conditions (Phase VII, OLR=4.07 kg 
COD/m 3/d), microbial community in UASB was dominated with bacterial phylum Bacteroidet es 
(41.2%) and hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanogenium  (52.0%), which correlated to the 
high SMA observed in the present study and demonstrated their high robustness against high 
organic loading and ammonia stress. It should be noticed that although ace toclastic 
methanogenesis is commonly found in anaerobic digesters, the dominance of hydrogenotrophic 
methanogens has been reported previously for anaerobic digesters treating wastewater with high 
ammonia concentrations (Lee et al., 2018; Lü et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2018; Werner et al., 2014) . 
Notably, methanogenic pathway through the syntrophic acetate oxidations (SAO) are generally 
found to be coupled in these processes, which may con tribute to the enhanced methane 
production  under this condition. Further studies on the microbial activities and methane 
production pathways under various operational conditions (e.g., RNA and protein analysis or  112 stable isotope studies) are needed to better elucidate the relationship of the microb ial community 
structure and methane production .   
 
5.4. Discussion  
5.4.1 Superior treatment performance in comparison to the literature  
As compared to the previous reported studies treating household blackwater through various 
types of system design and o perational conditions, the present study demonstrated highest OLR 
of 4.1 kg COD/m 3/d and shortest HRT of 2.6 days, with satisfactory COD removal efficiency 
(~84%) and methane production (0.68 m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d). For instance, van Voorthuizen et 
al. (van Voorthuizen et al., 2 008) used a combined UASB reactor (operating at 35 °C) and 
membrane treatment  system  to treat conventional toilet collected blackwater (COD = 1,139 mg/L) 
with an OLR of ~2.3 kg COD/m 3/d, and achieved an overall (UASB+membrane) COD t removal 
efficiency of 91% (64% by UASB, 27% by membrane filtration) and methane production of 0.27 
g CH 4-COD/ g influent COD t. The authors attributed their observed low COD removal efficiency 
(in UASB) and low methane production to the solids/sludge wash -out from the reactor. A study 
treating medium strength blackwater (COD = 5,500 mg/L) using a sludge blanket ana erobic 
baffled reactor (operating at 25 -28 °C) with an OLR of 2.3 (±0.5) kg COD/m 3/d achieved 78% 
COD t removal and 0.37 -0.81 m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d (Moges et al., 2018) . The high methane 
production  reported could be attributed to the higher BMP ( 0.69-0.73 g CH 4-COD/g influent 
COD t) of the feedstock used,  as compared to the BMP (0.48 g CH 4-COD/g influent COD t, 
section 5.6 ) of the blackwater used in the present study, and the reduction  of potential ammonia 
inhibition with long blackwater pre -hydrolysis time (36 -48 h) . For the treatment of high strength 
vacuum toilet collected blackwater ( COD  = ~10,000 mg/L ), relatively lower OLRs have been 
reported. For instance, a CSTR (operating at 35 °C) was operated with an OLR of 0.5 kg 
COD/m 3/d and achieved 61% COD removal (Wendland et al., 2007) ; a mesophilic UASB -septic 
tank system (operati ng at 25 °C) with an OLR of 0.42 kg COD/m 3/d achieved 78% COD 
removal (Kujawa -Roeleveld et al., 2006) ; and a pilot plant UASB -septic tank  system (operating 
at 25 °C) with a lower OLR of 0.36 kg COD/m 3/d achieved 87% COD removal (De Graaff et al., 
2010) . A UASB reactor treating vacuum toilet collected blackwater with OLR = 1 kg COD/m 3/d 
(HRT = 8 .7 d) operating at 25 °C achieved 78% COD t removal (De Graaff et al., 2010) . The high 
COD removal efficiency of 90% with a high methane production rate  of 0.18 m3 CH 4/ m 3  113 reactor /d were achieved in a UASB reactor at 25 °C with an OLR of 0.9 kg COD/m 3/d applied 
(Tervahauta et al., 2014) . To date, the highest OLR used for treating high strength vacuum toilet 
collected blackwater was 1.4 kg COD/m 3/d (HRT=8.3 d) with a UASB reactor, which achieved 
78% COD removal (Zeeman et al., 2008) . All these reported operations treating high strength 
vacuum toilet blackwater generated lower methane production rate s of 0.04 -0.28 m3 CH 4/ m 3 
reactor /d, as compared with the current study (0.68 m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d).   
 
The superior OLR achieved in the present study can be attributed to at least three reasons: (i ) 
mitigation of blackwater free ammonia inhibition through adopting blackwater storage strategy 
in this work, (ii) well acclimatized microbial communities due to step -wisely increased OLR for 
acclimation, and (iii) the operation conditions applied (UASB re actor at 35 °C) for effective 
hydrolysis. Details of different reactor operation strategies are discussed below.  
 
5.4.2 Feedwater composition  
Blackwater characteristics vary largely depending on collection system types, and age groups, 
and food habits and  choices of residents. Overall, the blackwater characteristics used in the 
present study are comparable with reported vacuum toilets collected blackwater (De Graaff et al., 
2010) . In particular, vacuum toilet collected raw blackwater contains high pH (8.6 -8.8) and high 
ammonia nitrogen concentration (>1,000 mg NH 4-N/L). As a result, free ammonia inhibition can 
be significant when treating blackwater at 35 °C (Gao et al., 2019) , which may help to explain 
the low OLR used for treating this type of blackwater. In the current study, the short -time 
(average 0.5 d) stored raw blackwater in the influent tank under 20 °C significantly reduced free 
ammonia concentration of the UASB influent (from 431 to 155 mg/L) through reducing the 
feedstock pH (8.05), demonstrating an effective simple free ammonia mitigation strategy.  
 
5.4.3 Blackwater hydrolysis  
Under high OLR (4.9 kg COD/m 3/d) and short HRT (2.1 days) conditions in Phase VI, clear 
limitation of substrate hydrolysis was observed, which led to decreased methane production. 
Limitation in hydrolysis is often observed under high OLR conditions for reactors treating 
complex wastes, when the insufficient SRT could not satisfy  the hydrolysis of particulate COD 
(De Graaff et al., 2010; Zeeman and Sanders, 2001) . As a result of hydrolysis limitation, COD  114 accumulation and  methane production reduction have also been reported (Rajagopal et al., 2019; 
Rico et al., 20 15), which can eventually cause system instability and process inhibition. For 
instance, a 33% increase in OLR led to a 20% reduction in particulate COD removal and 25% 
reduction in methane production  for a CSTR reactor co -digesting blackwater and food waste 
(Wendland et al., 2007) . In our study, 47% decrease in solids COD hydrolysis efficiency  and 
20% decrease in methanisation rate (compared to Phase I -V) have been observed. It was 
observed when OLR was reduced to 4.1 kg COD/m 3/d, system reco vered with an increased 
hydrolysis efficiency (29%) and methanisation rate (0.44 g CH 4-COD/g influent COD t). Future 
process optimization to further enhance blackwater treatment should consider options to enhance 
COD solids hydrolysis, through pretreatment, implementing new reactor design that improves 
sludge retention, or optimizing operation conditions that facilitate faster hydrolysis (Cheng et al., 
2019; Liu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 201 9).  
 
5.4.4 Methanogenesis pathway  
As shown in the microbial analysis results, the hydrogenotrophic methanogens were predominant 
in the UASB reactor. This observation correlated well with our SMA results in that SMA 
(H2&CO 2) was much greater than the SM A (acetate), indicating high H 2&CO 2 utilization 
capacities of the sludge. Similar community shifts towards the hydrogenotrophic pathway have 
been reported previously for feedstock with high ammonia contents (e.g., FA above 128 -330 
mg/L) (Schnürer and Nordberg, 2008) , which was often accompanied with the syntrophic acetate 
oxidation (SAO) pathway (De Francisci et al., 2015) . Our SMA (acetate) results demonstrated 
that the UASB sludge was capable of utilizing  acetate as substrate; which may also be attributed 
to the possible syntrophic acetate oxidation activities from SAO bacteria that function 
syntrophically with the hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Karakashev et al., 2006 ). Unfortunately, 
information on the SAO community has not yet been fully developed. None of the five known 
species in the SAO communities, including Thermacetogenium phaeum , Pseudothermotoga 
lettingae , Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans , Clostridium ultun ense and Syntrophaceticus 
schinkii  (Westerholm et al.,  2016)  were detected in the current study. But it is worth noting that 
bacterial phyla Chloroflexi  and Synergistetes in this study (with relative abundance of 2.6 -6.0% 
and 0 -2.5% in the detected operation Phases) have been reported to function through the SAO  115 pathway (Li et al., 2015) . Further studies are needed to identify the di verse SAO communities 
and their interactions with hydrogenotrophic methanogens.  
 
5.4.5 Environmental implications  
With an average methane production of 0.68 (±0.08) m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d at an OLR of 4.07 kg 
COD/m 3/d achieved  in this study, and the specifi c energy of methane being 40 MJ/  m3 CH 4 
(Zhang et al., 2018) , the specific energy produced from our blackwater treatment study is 27.34 
(±3.05) MJ/m 3 reactor /d as heat. In comparison with other high -strength (COD~10,000 mg/L) 
blackwater operations, the present work achieved higher biometha ne recovery per m3 reactor  
installed than the values from the reported literature, which generated heat energy varied from 
1.6 to 11.2 MJ/m 3 reactor /d (De Graaff et al., 2010; Kujawa -Roeleveld et al., 2 005; Tervahauta 
et al., 2014; Wendland et al., 2007; Zeeman et al., 2008) . The overall recovered energy can  be 
utilized for heating up the blackwater treatment system and nearby community , representing  a 
sustainable approach for resource  recovery  and reuse  from municipal wastewater. Overall, this 
work underlines the significance in reducing the process inhibition and the hydrogenotrophic 
methanogenesis pathway in treating high strength wastewater.  
 
5.5. Conclusion  
A continuous laboratory -scale UASB reactor treating vacuum toilet collected blackwater at 35 
°C was demonstrated in this paper. The maximum reactor treatment capacity was challenged by 
step-wise OLR increase and HRT reduction. COD t removal efficiency of 84% (±5%), and 
methane pro duction of 0.68 (±0.08) m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d were successfully achieved with an 
OLR of 4.1 kg COD/m 3/d (HRT 2.6 days). Hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway was 
dominant in the blackwater digestion system, and the hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
Methanogenium  were enriched in the UASB reactor.  
 
5.6 Supplementary materials  
5.6.1 Blackwater storage in influent tank  
Preliminary tests have been conducted to evaluate the change in the blackwater chemical and 
biological properties, the results are shown in Table S 5.1. The tests have been conducted on three 
groups of collected blackwater with each group in triplicated samples. Bio-methane potential  116 (BMP) tests were conducted following the description in the manuscript for the 0 -day stored raw 
blackwater, 0.5 -day stored blackwater and 1 -day stored blackwater. Regarding the changes of 
influent characteristics due to blackwater storage, it is observed that 0.5 -day storage has led to 
the change in VFA concentrations with ~15% increase in acetate and propionate and  ~18% 
increase in butyrate ( section 5.3.1), and further increase in blackwater storage time to 1 d ay led 
to an 21% increase in acetate concentration, 3% increase in propionate concentration and 24% 
increase in butyrate concentration, as compared with fresh ly collected raw blackwater. Under 
such condition, blackwater pH was lowered from initial 8.67 (±0.08) to 8.05 (±0.24) then 7.75 
(±0.29), and the free ammonia (FA) concentration was dropped from initial 431.3 (±44.5) to 
154.6 (±86.4) and then to 122.3 (±42 ) mg/L. Blackwater BMP increased from original 0.38 g 
CH 4-COD/g influent COD t to 0.42 g CH 4-COD/g influent COD t with 0.5 -day storage. Further 
increase in storage time didn’t significantly improve BMP. Thus, 0.5-day storage was applied in 
the blackwater tre atment studies. During the whole UASB operation, the characteristics for raw 
blackwater and UASB influent have been monitored and compared (Table S 5.2). The overall 
BMP of the UASB influent for the whole operation showed a value of 0.48 ± 0.05 g CH 4-COD/g 
influent COD t. 
 
5.6.2 Free ammonia  
The free ammonia concentrations presented in the manuscript were calculated from the following 
equation:

10−(0.09018 +2729 .92
𝑇 (𝐾)))−1 
NH 3: Free ammonia (FA) (in mg/L);  
TAN: Total ammonia nitrogen (in mg/L);  
T (K): Kelvin temperature.  
 
5.6.3 Energy recovery  
The calculations of energy recovery from blackwater anaerobic treatment systems were made 
based on the methane production rate  (m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor /d) that one system achieved and  the 
value of specific energy of methane as heat 40 MJ/m 3. Comparisons were made between the 
reported values and the current study. All presented values are listed in Table S 5.3.  117 The total energy required to heat up the blackwater from 20 °C to 35°C is 63 MJ/m 3 blackwater, 
while our produced methane can generate 67.76 MJ/ m 3 of heat which is sufficient for the heat 
consumption.  The detailed calculation is shown below.  
 
For the energy calculation: we consider heat up the inflow blackwater from 20 °C to 35 ° C, we 
calculate the heat consumption as following : 
 
Heating consumption per m 3 blackwater : 
Δ Temperature × Specific heat capacity of water × blackwater volume  
 =15 °C ×4.2 ×10 3 kJ/m 3/°C ×1 m 3 =63 MJ/m 3 blackwater.  
 
Our results showed a 44% of influent COD could be converted to methane, given the influent 
blackwater COD as 11 g/L, the methane heat value of 40 MJ/ m 3, we calculate the heat 
production as following :  
 
Heat production per m 3 blackwater :  
Heat value of methane × methane production  
= 40 MJ/ m 3 × (11 kg/m 3 × 44% ×0.35 m 3 CH 4/kg COD)  
= 67.76 MJ/ m 3 
 
Energy balance  
Energy balance = energy production - energy consumption =67.76 MJ/m 3- 63 MJ/m 3 
blackwater= 4.76 MJ/m 3 blackwater treated.

  127 CHAPTER 6. MICROBIAL COMMUNITY DYNAMICS IN ANAEROBIC DIGESTERS 
TREATING CONVENTIONAL AND VACUUM TOILET FLUSHED BLACKWATER4 
6.1 Introduction 
Our previous results showe d that distinct microbial communities were develope d in batch 
reactors treati ng different types of blackwater (Ga o et al., 2019) . The microbial community 
development was associate d with not onl y the organics compositi on and concentrati on, but also 
free ammonia concentrati on and pH. In particula r, vacuum toilet collecte d bl ackwate r contains a 
much grea
ter free ammonia concentrati on as compared t o bl ackwate r collecte d from 
conve
ntional toilets . High concentrati on of free ammonia has bee n repor ted as a stress fact or in 
full-scale anaerobic digesters treati ng municipal sludge , manure , and other organic wastes (Sun 
et a
l., 2014; De Vrieze et al ., 2015; Mulle r et al., 2016; Tia n et al., 2018a). Free ammonia could 
inhibi
t microbial activities a nd reduce COD removal a nd methane producti on efficiencies . It has 
been rec
ognize d that hydrogenotrophic methanogens are dominant  under high ammonia stress 
rathe r than acetoclastic methanogens (Werne r et al., 2014; Tia n et al., 2018a) . Using acetate as 
the organic fee d, it was demonstrate d that microorganisms unde rgo a syntrophic acetate 
oxidati on and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (SAO-HM ) pat hway unde r high ammonia 
conditions (Mosbae k et al., 2016; Westerholm et al ., 2016; T ian et al., 2018b) . For com plex 
substrate feeding, e.g. blackwater, whether such a mechanism could occur remains unknow n. 
Furthe
r, microbial  population  development  in continuous  ope rating  reactors  differs  from  batch 
syst
ems. One of the  most  widely  applied  anaerobic  digestion  system  is the upflow  anaerobic 
sludge
 blanket (UASB) reactor. The upflow operation enables the sludge maintenance inside the 
reactor  and improves  the c ontact  between  the wastewater  stream  and the microorganisms 
(Luostarinen  and Rintala,  2007).  Blackwater  treatment  using  a continuous  U ASB  reactor  h as 
been re
ported  in a fe w recent  studies  a t different  operational  conditions.  A 91 %  COD  removal 
and a  methane production of 0.27 gCH 4-COD/gCOD were achieved through  t he combination of 
UASB  and membrane  reactor  at 37 °C, treating  5 L w ater flushed  blackwater  (van Voorthuizen 
________________  
4 A version of this chapter has been published: Gao, M., Guo, B., Zhang, L., Zhang, Y., Liu, Y., 2019a. 
Microbial community dynamics in anaerobic digesters treating conventional and vacuum toilet flushed blackwater. 
Water Res. 160, 249–258. 128 et al., 2008) . An average of 78 % COD removal and methane production of 1.8 m 3 CH 4/m3 of 
blackwater were reported in a UASB reactor treating vacuum toilet blackwater at 25 °C with an 
HRT of 8.7 days  (De Graaff et al., 2010) . A 90 % COD removal was achieved at low 
temperatures of 20 °C and 10 °C treating synthetic blackwater of 1 g/L total COD with a two -
phased UASB -septic tank (Luostarinen and Rintala, 2007) . However, no studies have reported 
the development of the m icrobial communities inside continuous operating blackwater treatment 
reactors at different operational conditions, or investigated the links between operational 
parameters, microbial communities, and reactor performances.  
The current study aims to inves tigate the microbial community development in continuous 
operating UASB reactors treating conventional and vacuum toilet flushed blackwater with 
increments of organic loadings, and to compare the acclimatized microbial consortia between the 
two types of bl ackwater feedings. Conventional and vacuum toilet flushed blackwater generate  
different chemical properties due to the different amount of flushing water applied, and the ir 
treatment performances from the two UASB reactors w ere compared at  similar  organic loading 
rates. The microbial community structure, diversity, and composition at three development 
phases were investigated. The information can help elucidate the underlying microbial driving 
force, and guide future reactor design and operation.  
6.2 Mater ials and methods  
6.2.1 Sample collection and reactor operation  
Fresh blackwater was collected from > 20 persons every week during the experimental period 
and stored at 4 °C until use. Dilution of blackwater was performed using tap water to mimic 
conventional toilets at 9 L water per flush and vacuum toilets at 1 L wat er per flush.  
The influent was prepared daily and filled into storage bottles at room temperature, then fed into 
two 5 L upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors (working volume 4.7 L) with 
peristaltic pumps (Longer pump BT 100 -2J). The UASB reacto rs were operated at 35 °C, fed 
with 1 L water/flush or 9 L water/flush blackwater. Both UASB reactors were seeded with 2.35 
L anaerobic flocculant sludge (volatile suspended solids [VSS] concentration of 13.1 (±0.6) g/L) 
from a full -scale mesophilic anaero bic digester treating primary sludge and waste activated 
sludge in a local wastewater treatment plant in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.  129 The operational conditions of UASB reactors and treatment performances at three phases are 
shown in Table 6.1. Total operat ion durations for the UASB reactors treating conventional toilet 
blackwater and vacuum toilet blackwater were 120 and 115 days, respectively. The calculation 
of hydraulic retention time (HRT) was performed by dividing the reactor working volume (L) to 
the influent blackwater flowrate (L/d). The organic loading rates (OLR) were calculated by 
dividing the average influent blackwater chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations to the 
HRT of each operation phase for the two UASB reactors.  
The HRT was stepwise reduced from phase 1 to phase 3, leading to increasing organic loading 
rates. For the conventional toilet blackwater reactor (CT), HRT decreased from 5.5 to 3 and 1.4 
d, and the organic loading rate was increased from 0.18 to 0.36 and 0.76 kg  COD/ m3/d. For the 
vacuum toilet blackwater reactor (VT), HRT were 36, 20, 12 d ays, and the organic loading rate 
was 0.28, 0.48 and 0.81 kg  COD/m 3/d in phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For each operational 
phase, the two reactors’ organic loading rates were ma intained relatively similar (p  >0.05). HRTs 
(and corresponding OLRs) applied in the current study were selected based on literature values 
and tested in our reactors to ensure stable operation. For instance, the reported HRT for CT 
blackwater anaerobic tre atment systems varied from 0.5 -3.5 days (Abdel -Shafy et al., 2009; 
Gallagher and Sharvelle , 2010; van Voorthuizen et al., 2008) ; while much longer HRTs ranging 
from 8.3 -30 da ys (Zeeman et al., 2008)  were reported for VT blackwater treatment.   
6.2.2 Chemical analysis  
The influent and effluent characteristics of each phase were monitored to reveal chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) removal effici ency and methane production. Concentrations of influent and 
effluent COD were measured base on standard methods (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012) , and 
ammonia nitrogen was measured using Hach TNT vial tests (Hach, USA). Free ammonia 
concentrat ions were calculated from total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentration, pH, and 
temperature using the following equation (Hansen et al., 1998) :  
𝑁𝐻 3(𝐹𝐴)=1.214 ×𝑇𝐴𝑁 ∙(1+10−𝑝𝐻
10−(0.09018 +2729 .92
𝑇 (𝐾)))−1(eq. 6.1) 
Three main volatile fatty acids (VFAs): acetate, propionate and butyrate were analyzed on a 
DIONEX ICS -2100 Ionic chromatography (IC) system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA, 130 USA) equipped with a conductivity detector and IonPac AS18 Analytical Column: 2 × 250 mm. 
Prior to sample analysis, 2 mL fresh collected UASB effluent was diluted with ultrapure water 
and filtered through 0.2 μm nylon membrane filter (Fisher Scientific, CA). Biogas composition 
was measured using GC 7890B (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara USA) equipped with a 
thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and two columns (Molsieve 5A 2.44 m 2 mm for CH 4 and 
Hayesep N 1.83 m 2 mm f or N 2, O 2 and CO 2). The temperature of the oven, injector, and 
detector was 100, 150, and 200 °C during detection, respectively. For each gas detection, 10 mL 
biogas was withdrawn with gas -tight syringe from the gas bag with 10 times rinse prior to ensure 
homogenous biogas contents. The amount of methane that generated from feed blackwater was 
defined as “methanisation” in this study, which was represented as gCH 4-COD/gfeedCOD. The 
chemical analysis including influent and effluent properties and the biogas production were all 
conducted 3 -5 times a week during operation time.  
Both the effluent quality and the biogas production were evaluated to demonstrate the steady 
state (stable operation of at least 20 consecutive days in each operation phase) before any  change 
in operation conditions. Table 6.1 demonstrates the reactor performance under steady -state 
conditions.  
Isotope fractions of biogas were measured at the end of operation at the Department of Earth and 
Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Albe rta, with GC 5890 Series II (Hewlett Packard, 
USA). The apparent fractionation factor ( 𝛼𝑐) was calculated by the following equation (Hao et
al., 2017) :  
𝛼𝑐=(𝛿13𝐶𝑂2+103)
(𝛿13𝐶𝐻4+103)(eq. 6.2) 
6.2.3 Statistical analysis  
ANOVA was performed us ing Microsoft Excel ® to compare  the applied organic loading rates , 
and the obtained methanisation rates between  the two UASB reactors . A p -value less than 0.05 
was considered statistically different.  
6.2.4 DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencing  
Sludge  samples for microbial community analysis were collected from the inoculum and mixed 
sludge from all sampling ports of the UASB reactors’ sludge bed at steady state at the end of 131 each operation Phase. The collected mixed sludge samples were sampled for 1.5  mL and 
centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were used for 
DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, 
Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All DNA sa mples were extracted 
with fresh sludge samples in duplicates. The extracted DNA concentration and quality were 
checked using NanoDrop One (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Samples were stored at -20 °C 
until sent to sequencing center at RTL Genomics (Texas, USA ). Bacterial 16S rRNA genes were 
amplified using the universal primer -pair 357wF (5’ -CCT ACG GGN GGC WGC AG -3’) and 
785R (5’ -GAC TAC HVG GGT ATC TAA TCC -3’). Archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified 
using universal primer set 517F (5’ -GCY TAA AGS RNC CGT AGC -3’) and 909R (5’ -TTT 
CAG YCT TGC GRC CGT AC -3’). The amplicons were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq PE300 
platform.  
6.2.5 Bioinformatics analysis  
The raw sequences were processed using the DADA2 algorithm (Callahan et al., 2016)  in 
Qiime2 pipelines (Caporaso et al., 2010)  to pair forward and reverse sequences, and remove low -
quality sequences and chimeras. The total good -quality sequence reads were 92,080 for bacteria 
and 110,186 for archaea. Taxonom y was assigned using 97% similarity in GreenGenes (version 
13_8) reference database (McDonald et al., 2012; Werner et al., 2012) . The raw sequences were 
deposited in NCBI GenBank PRJNA521788.  
Alpha and Beta diversity and  principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were analyzed using “vegan” 
package (Jari Oksanen et al., 2017)  in R (RCoreTeam, 2017) . Heatmap was produced using 
“gplot” package (Warnes et al., 2016) . Metagenome, weighted average rrn operon copy number 
and functional gene annotation were calculated from 16S rRNA gene sequences with closed  
references in GreenGenes (version 13_8) using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by 
Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) (Langille et al., 2013) . The reference database 
used in PICRUSt was the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system  (Markowitz et al., 2012)  
for metagenome and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 
2012)  for functional gene annotation.  132 6.3 Results  
6.3.1 Operation phases and performance  
The treatment performances were shown in Table 6.1. The different toilet flushing systems 
provided different COD and TAN concentrations for the two types of collected blackwater, with 
the influent COD concentration at 900 -1100 mg/L and TAN at 40 -70 mg/L for the conventional 
toilet (CT) blackwater, and th e influent COD concentration at 8500 -11000 mg/L and TAN at 
1000 -1100 mg/L (supplemented with ammonia when the ammonia concentration of the collected 
vacuum toilet (VT) blackwater showed values lower than the 1,000 -1,100 mg/L to maintain 
constant feedstock properties) for the vacuum toilet (VT) blackwater. The variations in chemical 
properties in both conventional toilet and vacuum toilet collected blackwater are due to the 
natural fluctuation of the blackwater production. The influent blackwater properties for the two 
types were similar to reported values in the literature (De Graaff et al., 2010; van Voorthuizen et 
al., 2008) . The methanisation was significantly higher in the VT reactor (p  <0.05), but not 
significantly different between different phases in either reactor. The accumulated methane 
content in the biogas was stable through all phases, and was slightly higher in the VT reactor, 72 
% in the CT reactor, and 75 % in the VT reactor. The CT reactor methanisation (0.23 -0.29 gCH 4-
COD/gfeedCOD) was comparable with reported results of 0.27 gCH 4-COD/gfe edCOD using the 
combined UASB and membrane reactor (van Voorthuizen et al., 2008) .  
The effluent qualities were relatively stable for both reactors in terms of effluent pH, COD, and 
TAN. The average COD removal efficiencies for the CT reactor was 72 % (± 6 % ) for the three 
operational phases in this study, which was higher than the reported 64 % COD removal 
efficiency with similar operating temperature at 37 °C, but shorter HRT of 12 hrs (van 
Voorthuizen et al., 2008) . The average COD removal efficiencies for VT  reactor was 89% (± 2 
%) for the three operational phases in this study, which was higher than the reported 78 % COD 
removal efficiency with a less favorable operating temperature at 25 °C and shorter HRT of 8.7 
days (De Graaff et al., 2010) . Each type of detected volatile fatty acids (VFAs) for both reactors 
were lower than 50 mg/L, indicating sufficient methanogenesis capacity inside the systems under 
the studied conditions. The TAN concentrations were increa sed in the effluent compared with the 
influent, due to the release of ammonia from the substrate hydrolysis process. Accordingly, the 
calculated free ammonia concentrations were higher in the VT reactor (98.9 -123.5 mg/L) than in  133 the CT reactor (1.7 -2.5 mg/ L). The free ammonia levels were lower than the typically reported 
inhibition levels of  >200 mg/L (De Graaff et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2019) .

In the VT reactor, the sludge VSS concentration increased from the initial concentration of 13.1 
(±0.6) g/L, to 24.9 (±5.1), 28.9 (±3.4) and 23.5 (±0.4) g/L in Phases 1 -3, respectively. The CT 
reactor also showed increases of sludge VSS concentrations to 1 5.6 (±1.4), 17.5 (±4.7) and 15.4 
(±1.7) g/L in Phases 1 -3, respectively. VSS concentrations were resulted from different 
microbial growth dynamics and developed microbial communities in the two reactors. The 
community development is a dynamic process, whic h can be affected by various factors. The  134 organic loading rates (OLRs) were kept similar between the two reactors, but the ammonia 
loading rates and concentrations were higher in the VT reactor. Therefore, the main factors for 
microbial community developme nt were OLR increases through Phases 1 -3, and ammonia 
concentration difference between the two reactors.  
 
6.3.2 Microbial community diversity  
The rank abundance distributions of archaeal and bacterial communities at the genus level and 
the total number of genera are presented in Fig. 6.1. In both CT and VT reactors, the archaeal 
communities ( Fig. 6.1A) showed a steeper gradient than the inoculum, representing a less even 
distribution. The first ranked archaeal genus took up around 60 % of total community ab undance, 
indicating mono -enrichment in the community. The total number of genera were similar, 
between 9 and 11 in each sample.  
 
The distribution curves of the first 15 bacterial genera ( Fig. 6.1B) of the three phases in the CT 
reactor were lower than the inoculum. On the contrary, the VT reactor showed much steeper 
slopes in phases 1 and 2, due to the higher relative abundance of the first ranked genus. In phase 
3, the relative abundance of the first ranked genus dropped and the distribution curve beca me 
similar with the inoculum. The number of genera was 119 in the inoculum, 116 in CT phase 1, 
and increased to 146 and 172 in phases 2 and 3. A decrease was shown in the VT reactor to 81, 
71, and 79 in the three phases respectively.  
 
The evenness of the c ommunities was measured using the Gini coefficient (Werner et al., 2014)  
(Fig. 6.1C). In archaea, the Gin i coefficient fluctuated along different phases. In bacteria, the 
community changed to higher evenness (lower Gini coefficient) in the CT reactor than the 
inoculum while it remained similar in the VT reactor. Compared with the inoculum, the archaeal 
Shanno n diversity ( Fig. 6.1D) fluctuated in different phases. In the bacterial community, the 
Shannon index showed higher values in the CT reactor compared with the inoculum; the VT 
reactor showed similar levels with the inoculum.  
 
The lower bacterial diversity  in the VT reactor (fewer genera, evenness, and Shannon index) as 
compared to that in the CT reactor indicated a higher stress level, possibly attributed to the high  135 organic and ammonia concentrations in VT collected blackwater (Table 6.1). Nevertheless, l ower 
bacterial diversity co -occurred with higher methane production in the VT reactor. This 
observation could be explained by the high substrate concentrations selecting microorganisms 
with higher growth rates, i.e. r-strategists (Klappenbach et al., 2000; Nemergut et al., 2016; Wu 
et al., 2017) , resulting in higher substrate utilization and methane production. A previous study 
show ed that higher organic loading rate selected r -strategists, which resulted an increased 
methane production with no inhibition on the microbial communities (Wu et al., 2017) .

VT_3 136 The beta -diversity of the archaeal and bacterial communities was presented on the principal 
coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot of Bray -Curtis distances among samples ( Fig. 6.2). The archaeal 
communities in phase 1 of both reactors shifted towards the same direction ( Fig. 6.2A). Then, the 
two reactors diverged to different directions, forming two clusters apart from each other along 
the PCoA1 axis, which explains 75.5 % of total sample  variance. The bacterial communities of 
the inoculum, feed blackwater, CT, and VT reactors formed clusters distinct with each other 
(Fig. 6.2B). The community was stable through phase 1 to phase 3 in either reactor. The bacterial 
communities that developed  in the two reactors were divergent, yet more similar than to the 
original community in the feeding blackwater, indicating that the operational conditions had 
greater impacts on the reactor communities than the communities in the feed water.  
 
The archaeal community changed slowly from phases 1 to 3, whereas the bacterial community 
did not change from phase 1. Comparing the temporal changes, the archaeal community takes a 
longer time than the bacterial community to stabilize. This could be expla ined by the fact that 
archaea have higher doubling time, i.e. slower growth than bacteria; and the community turnover 
rate is also slower (Zinder, 1993) . The concentrations of COD and TAN are putative leading 
factors that selected different communities. Werner  et al. (2014)  found that increases in ammonia 
concentration p erturbed the bacterial community in anaerobic digesters, leading to more 
unevenness in the microbial community (higher Gini coefficient). Similarly, in our data, the VT 
reactor received a high ammonia loading, and showed greater unevenness than the CT reac tor 
(Fig. 6.1C). Noticeably, the VT reactor had lower numbers of genera in both archaeal and 
bacterial communities than the CT reactor. The high concentrations of ammonia and other 
substrates probably inhibited more microbial genera, resulting in less dive rse communities.   137 Fig. 6. 2. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of archaeal communities of inoculum and reactor 
samples (A), and bacterial communities of blackwater, inoculum, and reactor samples (B). PCoA 
was computed using Bray -Curtis distance calculated using genus abundance data.  
6.3.3 Enriched archaeal consortia  
At the genus level, 11 archaeal taxa were detected among all samples ( Fig. 6.3). The inoculum 
was dominated by three methanogens (each >10 %): Methanolinea  and two unidentified genera 
in the family (f_) Methanospirillaceae . Two other genera showed relative abundance >1 %, 
Methanoculleus  and Methanospirillum . Methanosarcina  and Meth anosaeta  were at very low 
abundance (0.03 % and 0.04 % respectively) in the inoculum. The CT reactor inherited the most 
abundant genus Methanolinea  from the inoculum, which dominated through phase 1 to phase 3. 
Methanospirillum  gradually increased from pha se 1 to phase 3, becoming the second 
predominant genus. Methanoculleus  and the two unidentified genera in f_ Methanospirillaceae  
deceased gradually. Methanosarcina  increased in phases 1 and 2 (>1 %). Methanosaeta  was not 
detected in phase 1 and appeared in  phase 2 and 3 at low levels (<1 %). In the VT reactor, 
Methanolinea  was the most abundant genus in phase 1 and second most abundant in phases 2 
and 3. A remarkable increase was shown for Methanogenium , which was not detected in 
inoculum or the CT reactor,  but became dominant in phases 2 and 3 in the VT reactor. The two 
unidentified genera in Methanospirillaceae , Methanospirillum and Methanoculleus  decreased at 
138 the end of phase 3 compared with the inoculum.  Methanosaeta  became non -detectable, while 
Methanos arcina  slightly increased compared with the inoculum.  
The predominant archaeal genera in the inoculum and reactors were different in composition 
(Methanolinea, the family Methanospirillaceae , Methanoculleus , Methanospirillum and 
Methanogenium ), but they al l belong to the order Methanomicrobiales  which all perform 
hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Garcia et al., 2006) . Methanomicrobiales  is closely 
correlated to high TAN conditions in other studies, especially the genus Methanoculleus  
(Westerholm et al., 2012; Moestedt et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2018a) . In full -scale reactors, 
Methanomicrobiales  was less affected by the ammonia concentration compared to 
Methanobacteriales , Methanosaetaceae  and Methanosarcinaceae  (De Vrieze et al., 2015) . 
Methanomicrobiales  and Methanobacteriales  were the most abundant archaeal orders in 
syntrophic acetate oxidization digesters (Werner et al., 2014) . In our study,  Methanomicrobiales  
took up 99 %, 97 %, and 99 % of archaeal communities of the inoculum, CT reactor, and VT 
reactor, respectively. Methanoculleus  accounted for only 0.55 -0.84 % and 2.89 -9.56 % in CT 
and VT reactors, respectively.  
Methanogenium  was reported in a limited nu mber of studies of anaerobic digesters. It was 
reported as the most abundant archaea in household digesters at low temperatures (11.1 -15.7 oC) 
in high plateau environments (Han et al., 2018) . It was grown at low abundance in mesophilic 
anaerobic digester treating swine manure (Zhu et al., 2011; Qin et al., 2013) , as well as swine 
manure storage tanks (Barret et al., 2012; Barret et al., 2013) . Pure culture of Methanogenium  sp. 
showed slower growth rates with increasing concentration of ammonia at higher than 3 g NH 4+-
N/L (Hendriksen and Ahring, 1991) . However, previous studies aiming for high TAN conditions 
rarely reported Methanogenium  in the archaeal community.  Methanogenium  was found in marine 
methanogens (Romesser et al., 1979) , which are tolerant to high salinity. In a high -salinity 
anaerobic digester treating secondary slu dge, Methanomicrobiales  dominated in the archaeal 
community and species closely related to Methanogenium marinum  were abundant (Shin et al., 
2010) . Whether the salinity tolerance and ammonia t olerance could be compared may need 
further information.   139 Acetoclastic methanogenesis is more vulnerable to high ammonia concentration than 
hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Karakashev et al., 2006) ; thus acetoclastic methanogenesis 
may be inhibited in ammonia -rich reactors, such as reactors treating manure or slaughterhouse 
waste (Sun et al., 2014) . In our blackwater -fed reactors, the acetoclastic methanogen 
Methanosaeta  were i n low abundance in the CT reactor, and decreased to undetectable levels in 
the VT reactor. Methanosarcina  increased slightly in both reactors, possibly due to its versatile 
functionalities and resistance to harsh conditions (Sun et al., 2014; Mosbaek et al., 2016) . 
Although they were most commonly reported methanogens in sewage sludge fed anaerobic 
digesters (De Vrieze et al., 2015) , their abundance was lower than expected in our study. 
Noticeably, the sum of Methanosae ta and Methanosarcina  only accounted for 0.07 % of 
inoculum archaeal community, which may have some impact on the community in our reactors.  
 
Fig. 6. 3. Heatmap of archaeal genera, the taxonomic names were shown for genus level ( g_), or 
higher level (family: f_ ; order: o_; class: c_) if not identified at genus level. Color key indicates 
relative abundance of genera in each sample.  
 
6.3.4 Enriched bacterial consortia in CT and VT reactors  
The most abundant families and fold -changes compared to the inoculum are shown in Fig. 6.4. 
Four groups of families were classified (groups A -D in Fig. 6.4) based on their fold -changes in 
relative abundances. In group A, bacterial families increased in bot h reactors. Families in group 
 140 B or C were enriched in the CT reactor only or VT reactor only, respectively. Group D 
represents families that remained at similar or decreased abundances in both reactors.  
 
Enriched families in grouped A were low in the inoc ulum. The family Porphyromonadaceae  
increased to 15.9% in the CT reactor in phase 3, and 13.4% in the VT reactor in phase 3. 
Fibrobacteraceae  increased remarkably in the VT reactor to 13.8% in phase 3. Bacteroidaceae  
grew to 1.8% and 7.0% and Marinilabiace ae increased to 1.8% and 1.6%, in phase 3 of CT and 
VT reactors respectively. Lachnospiraceae  reached 2.8% in CT phase 3. One unidentified family 
in the order Clostridiales increased to 2.0% in the VT reactor in phase 3. Species in the families 
Porphyromon adaceae , Lachnospiraceae , and in the order Clostridiales  were also observed in 
communities under high ammonium conditions (Muller et al., 2016) .  
 
Porphyromonadaceae  abundance was significantly higher in high -ammonia reactors than in low -
ammonia reactors (Muller et al., 2016)  and a predominated anaerobic digester treating chicken 
wastes (Ziganshina et al., 2015) . Bacteroidaceae  was found at elevated abundance correlated 
with total ammonia concentration in full -scale reactors (De Vrieze et al., 2015) . Clostridiales 
species were reported for their tolerance of high ammonia concentrations (De Vrieze et al., 2015; 
Mosbaek et al., 2016; Muller et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2018a) . They were widely spread in the 
inoculum and reactors. Some of these bacteria were reported in anaerobic digesters treating 
animal wastes, e.g. swine ma nure, cattle manure, and chicken waste. Marinilabiaceae was highly 
abundant in ammonia -rich chicken -waste anaerobic digesters (Ziganshina et al., 2015) . 
Fibrobacteraceae  was the second most abundant family in cattle rumen fluid, Bacteroidaceae  
was the second most abundant family in cattle manure (Ozbayram et al., 2018b) . 
Fibrobacteraceae , Bacteroidaceae , Porphyromonadaceae  are important fiber -digesting bacteria 
capable of enhancing an aerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass (Yan et al., 2012; 
Ozbayram et al., 2018a; Ozbayram et al., 2018b) . Their increased abundance in the blackwater -
fed reactors could be associated with the presence of lignocellulosic matter in blackwater.  
 
Group D showed families that reduced to non -detectable levels, such as Microthrixaceae  in both 
reactors, Comamonada ceae and Syntrophorhabdaceae  in the VT reactor. The well -known 
syntrophic families, Syntrophorhabdaceae  and Syntrophaceae , decreased in both reactors. The  141 other families in group D decreased but still maintained their high abundance, such as 
Anaerolinaceae , Cloacamonaceae , Spirochaetaceae , Thermovirgaceae , and Rikenellaceae . 
 
6.3.5 Enriched bacteria specific to the CT reactor  
In the CT reactor, the enrichments (group B, Fig. 6.4) included sulfate -reducing bacterial 
families Desulfobulbaceae , Desulfomicrobia ceae, and Desulfobacteraceae , with total 
abundances of 7.3%, 5.2%, and 5.5% in phases 1 -3, respectively. This observation is correlated 
with the relatively higher sulfate concentration in the CT collected blackwater. Since the 
blackwater sulfate source was  supplemented from tap water (at a concentration of 61.9 ± 0.1 
mg/L), CT collected blackwater contains a higher sulfate concentration per COD (90.5 ± 17.8 
mg per gCOD) as compared to VT collected blackwater (28.3 ± 3.8 mg per gCOD). The 
COD/SO 42- ratios were 10.9 -11.7 and 33.6 -35.2 in the CT and VT feed respectively, which were 
higher than the reported inhibition threshold of 1.6 (Siles et al., 2010)  and d id not cause complete 
inhibition of methanogenesis. Negative effects of sulfate on methanogenesis have been reported 
previously, and mainly include (i) organic substrate competition between sulphate reducing 
bacteria and methanogens, and (ii) toxicity of s ulphate reduction produced H 2S towards 
methanogens (J.W.H. et al., 1994; Chen et al., 2008; Siles et al., 2010; Dai et al., 2017) . Hereby 
sulphate concentrations in CT collected blackwater should be monitored when designing 
anaerobic digestion systems for CT collected b lackwater treatment.  
 
Campylobacteraceae , Rhodocyclaceae , Pseudanabaenaceae , an unidentifed family in the class 
OPB56, Geobacteraceae , Opitutaceae , Elusimicrobiaceae  and an unidentifed family in the class 
Bacteroidales were higher than 1% in the last phase , inferring their possible active roles in 
treating the CT collected blackwater.  
 
6.3.6 Enriched bacteria specific to the VT reactor  
In the VT reactor, Fibrobacteraceae ( 13.8 % ), an unidentified family in the order Clostridiales  
(13.6 %, Fig. 6.4 group C), together with Porphyromonadaceae (13.4 %), were the most 
abundant families.  Specifically, less numbers of taxa (group C, Fig. 6.4) were enriched 
compared with the CT reactor (group B), in accordance with the lower community diversity ( Fig. 
6.1). Ruminococcaceae , Tissierellaceae , and Clostridiaceae  showed higher than a 2 -fold change 142 compared with the inoculum. Xanthomonadaceae  and Actinomycetales  were largely increased in 
phase 1, then decreased in phases 2 and 3.  
Ruminococcaceae , Tissierellace ae, and Clostridiales  have been reported in high -ammonia 
stressed anaerobic communities (Muller et al., 2016) . Species  in the family Tissierellaceae  were 
related to salt tolerance, such as  Tissierella  and Soehngeni  (Wang et al., 2017) . Sedimentibacter  
in the family Tissierellaceae  was enriched in low -ammonia SAO communities (Muller et al., 
2016) . SAO b acterial species include five known species, Thermacetogenium phaeum , 
Pseudothermotoga lettingae , Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans , Clostridium ultunense , and 
Syntrophaceticus schinkii , the latter two characterized as mesophilic SAOB (Westerholm et al., 
2016) . However, these species were not identified in our study. The enriched consortia in the VT 
reactor under high organic loading and ammonia stre sses resemble previously reported SAO 
communities (Werner et al., 2014; Muller et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2018a) , suggest ing that a 
broader number of species may be associated with SAO function under the high ammonia stress 
(Westerholm et al., 2016) .  143

and inoculum, 0.01% was added to families in inoculum to avoid zero denominator. Hierarchical

method.  
 
6.3.7 Functional shift  
At the end of reactor operation, a carbon isotope test was performed for the methane and carbon 
dioxide gases. Our results showed that the biogas  𝛿13𝐶𝐻4 fraction was -46.71 ‰ and the  
𝛿13𝐶𝑂2 fraction was -10.60 ‰ in the CT reactor, and -49.65 ‰ 𝛿13𝐶𝐻4 and -4.59 ‰ 𝛿13𝐶𝑂2 
fraction in the VT reactor. The apparent fractionation factor ( 𝛼𝑐) was 1.038 and 1.047 for the CT 
and VT reactors respectively. A higher 𝛼𝑐 indicates that a methanogenesis pathway shifts from 
acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Lü et al., 2013; Hao et al., 
2017) . Our results showed that the 𝛼𝑐 value was higher in the VT reactor than that in the CT 
reactor, indicating that the archaeal communities were dominated by hydrogenotrophic 
methanogens. The ammonia concentration wa s higher in the VT reactor which may be related 
with the higher 𝛼𝑐.  
 
The microbial community 16S rRNA gene data were analyzed to predict functional genes 
(Kanehisa et al., 2012; Markowitz et al., 2012)  related with SAO -HM. The major 
methanogenesis pathways, hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis, consisted of 
different functional genes ( section 6.5 ). The total abundances are shown in Fig. 6.5A. 
Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis genes sli ghtly decreased in the CT reactor and increased in 
the VT reactor, whereas acetoclastic methanogenesis genes stayed at similar levels in all 
samples. The gene abundances were predicted from the 16S rRNA genes thus it reflects the 
taxonomic abundances in Fig. 6.3.  
 
In the bacterial community, the prevalence of SAO indicator  fhs gene (Muller et al., 2016)  is 
shown in Fig. 6.5B. Compared to the inoculum, both 9L -BW and 1L -BW fed reactors had 
increased  levels of the fhs gene. It increased gradually in the CT reactor. In the VT reactor, the 
fhs gene abundance showed a dramatic increase from phase 1 to phase 2, then marginally 
decreased in phase 3. The total relative abundances of OTUs contributing to fhs gene prevalence 
showed similar trends, accounting for 24 % of total bacterial OTU abundance in the inoculum, 
34-40 % in the CT reactor and 30 -38 % in the VT reactor. Detailed OTU relative contribution to  145 the fhs gene prevalence is shown in supplementary Fig. S6.2 and Fig. S6.3 at a family level. The 
main contributing families in the inoculum were syntrophic bacteria Syntrophorhabdaceae  and 
Syntrophaceae , which decreased in both reactors. In the CT reactor, the highest contribution was 
from sulfate -reducing  bacterial families Desulfobulbaceae  and Desulfomicrobiaceae . 
Porphyromonadaceae  and Ruminococcaceae , showed increased contribution in phase 3. In the 
VT reactor, the highest contribution was from an unidentified family in the order Clostridiales , 
which in creased through phases 1 to 3.  
 
Note  that the CT and VT reactors did not show significant differences in their predicted 
functional profiles. Their reactor performances and enriched community compositions are 
different, but it could hardly be explained through the predicted prevalence of the  fhs gene. The 
higher abundances of sulfate -reducing bacteria ( Fig. 6.4) in the CT reactor may contribute to 
lower methane production yield (Liu et al., 2015)  due to the competition of sulfate -reducing 
bacteria for carbon source, and/or the toxicity of hydrogen sulphide (produced from sulfate 
reduction reaction) to methanogens (J.W.H. et al., 1994; Siles et al., 2010; Dai et al., 2017) . 
Ammonia concentration, together with other possible stress factors in the VT reactor, could 
contribute to the low microbial community diversity; which did not significantly impact the 
SAO -HM communities.

fhs contr ibuting O TUs147 blackwater, which has led to different biogas production rates and microbial communities in 
anaerobic digestion reactors treating blackwater. The VT reactor showed a higher methane 
production rate, without any noticeable inhibition to the microbial community. The temporal 
dynamics of archaeal and bacterial communities indicated that the archaeal co mmunity had 
slowly adapted during different phases, resulting in a mono -dominance of a single genus; 
whereas the bacterial community was quickly adapted and remained stable through different 
phases. Lower alpha -diversity and higher methane production rates  indicated selection of r -
strategists in the VT reactor consortia due to the high substrate and ammonia concentrations in 
VT collected blackwater.  
The enriched microorganisms were compared between the CT and VT reactors. Methanolinea 
was the most abundant  archaeal genus in the CT reactor, and Methanogenium  in the VT reactor. 
Methanogenium  was reported to tolerate high ammonia concentrations but is infrequently 
reported as dominant in anaerobic digesters. Both reactors were dominated by hydrogenotrophic 
methanogens. The enriched bacteria were linked with high ammonia conditions, including  
Porphyromonadaceae , Fibrobacteraceae , Ruminococcaceae , Bacteroidaceae , Clostridiales , etc. 
The apparent fractionation factor ( 𝛼𝑐) calculated from 𝛿13𝐶𝑂2 and 𝛿13𝐶𝐻4 fractions and
predicted metagenomic functions indicated functional shifts to the synt rophic acetate oxidization 
and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway in the VT reactor. This study provided detailed 
information on microbial community dynamics and implied functions for concentrated and dilute 
types of blackwater treatment using anaerob ic digestion.

6.5.2 Results  
 
Fig. S6. 1. Relative abundances of top 5 abundant classes in each sample. Samples were 
inoculum, conventional toilet blackwater (CT) and vacuum toilet blackwater (VT) reactors at 
phase 1, 2, and 3.  
 
 149 The predominant bacterial classes are shown in Fig. S6.1. Bacteroidia  (phylum Bacteroidetes ) 
was the most abundant class in  the inoculum (34.0  %), and remained  at high levels in reactors: 
29.7 %, 30.2  %, 36.7  % in CT reactor phases 1 -3 and 26.8  %, 37.7  %, 33.1  % in VT reactor 
phases 1 -3, respectively.  Clostridia  (phylum Firmicutes ) was the second most abundant class in  
the VT reactor (19.6 -26.7 %), and in the CT  reactor  (8.9-13.4 %), with initial abundance of 5.7  
% in  the inoculum. Fibrobacteria  (phylum Fibrobacteres ) was not detected in inoculum and 
below 1  % in the CT  reactor but increased gradually in the VT  reactor (3.8  %, 8.0  % and 13.8  % 
in phases 1 -3). In the phylum Proteobacteria , Deltaproteobacteria  took up 6.7  % of inoculum 
and increased in the CT reactor, but decreased in the VT  reactor. Gammaproteobacteria , 
Betaproteobacteria  and Epsilonproteobacteria  were all increased in the CT  reactor. Only 
Gammaproteobacteria  were significant ly increased in VT reactor in phase 1. Cloacamonae  
(phylum WWE1) and Anaerolineae  (phylum Chloroflexi ) were the second and third highest 
classes in inoculum (23.2  % and 12.5  %) but all reduced to below 7  % in reactors .

  157 CHAPTER 7. HIGH-LOADING FOOD WASTE AND BLACKWATER ANAEROBIC 
CO-DIGESTION: MAXIMIZING BIOENERGY RECOVERY5 
7.1. Introduction 
Limitations on biomethane recove ry from source-diverted blackwate r treatment have been 
ident
ified i n our previous studies . The hi gh ammonia concentrati on in bla ckwate r can i nhibit the 
met
hanogenesis process . For instance , l ow methane yiel d (34%) was observe d when treating 
blac
kwater wit h a high free ammonia (FA ) concentration of 393 mg/L, as compare d to a methane 
yield of 48% when treati ng blackwate r wi th relativel y lowe r FA concentrations of 26 and 60 
mg/L (Gao et al ., 2019a) . Due t o t he high solid organic contents (53-85% of total organic matter 
(Kujawa-Roelevel d et al., 2005; va n V oorthuize n et al., 2008) ), substrate hydrolysis has been 
considere d as a rate-limiting ste p whe n performi ng anaerobic blackwater treatment (Zeema n and 
Sande
rs, 2001) . For example , a 8.2% reduc tion in the solids substrate hydrolysis efficienc y can 
result i n a 5 % decrease i n m ethane producti on yie ld in a blackwate r anaerobic digesti on process 
when solids retenti on ti me (SRT) decrease d from 2 54 days t o 75 days (De Graa ff et al., 2010). 
With such limiti ng factors , relativel y low OLRs were observe d in the establishe d bl ackwater 
anae
robic treatment systems (Ga o et al., 2019b; Luostarine n and Rintala , 2005; Zeeman et al., 
2008) . Our previ
ous st udy has demonstrate d the highest OL R of 4.1 kg CO D/m 3/d for t reating 
vacuum 
toilet collecte d blackwate r report ed to date usi ng an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket 
(UAS B) react or at 35 °C (Gao et al ., 2019b) , and found t hat furthe r increasi ng OLR resulte d in 
hydrolysis limitation (44% reduction in solids COD hydrol ysis efficiency).  
Multiple types of optimization methods regarding enhancing solid substrate hydrolysis have been 
reported  (Chen  et al., 2008;  Nguyen  e t al., 2017),  yet, these  strategies  come  with extra 
operational  and capital  costs,  which  a re not ideal  for industrial  i mplementation.  An alternative 
opt
ion is to perform  anaerobic  co-digestion  w ith other  o rganic  wastes,  such as food waste 
(Sil
vestre  et al., 2014).  With  the re adily  biodegradable  organics  and high C/N ratio,  food waste 
can help increase the organic  load, lower pH, optimize substrate C/N ratio,  and could ultimately 
faci
litate microbial growth and enhance microbial activities in anaerobic treatment systems  (Kim 
________________  
5 A version of this chapter has been published: Gao, M., Zhang, L., Liu, Y., 2020. High-loading food waste 
and blackwater anaerobic co-digestion: maximizing bioenergy recovery. Chem. Eng. J. 124911.  158 et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2019) . Extensive studies have been conducted on waste co -digestion 
over the past decade, especially for agricultural waste with high ammonium such as animal 
manure, and it has been well established that the better C/N ratios and buffer capacities of the co -
substrates helped improved treatment efficiencies and enhanced the maximum OLRs  (Kim et 
al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013, 2019) . Ho wever, only limited work has been conducted on 
blackwater and food waste co -digestion; most of these reported work were operated under low 
OLRs and no study has evaluated the feasibility of high -loading UASB treatment (Elmitwalli et 
al., 2006; Kujawa -Roeleveld et al., 2005; Lavagnolo e t al., 2017; Rajagopal et al., 2013; 
Rounsefell et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) . A continuous stirred tank reactor 
(CSTR) system achieved 50 -75% COD removal at various hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 -
20 days (OLRs 1 -2 kg COD/m 3/d) for blackwater and food waste co -digestion (Wendland et al., 
2007) . A pilot scale UASB -septic tank (0.2 m 3) obtained 82% COD removal with an HRT ~29 
days (Kujawa -Roeleveld et al., 2005) . A sequencing  batch reactor (SBR) treated feces and food 
waste and achieved 76.7% COD removal and obtained OLRs of 2 -3 kg COD/m 3/d (Rajagopal et  
al., 2013) . The highest OLR of 4.1 kg COD/m 3/d reported so far for blackwater and food waste 
co-digestion was demonstrated in an improved upflow solid reactor (IUSR), but the value did not 
exceed the highest OLR for treating only blackwater in our prev ious work. Organic loads of 
blackwater and food waste varied in these reported studies. An European demonstration study 
reported a feed BW and FW VSS load ratio of 1:1.6 with 5 L BW/capita /d and 200 g 
FW/capita /d production (Wendland et al., 2007) . A study in Singapore reported 2 L brown water 
(only feces) and 150 g food waste per capita daily production that resulted in VS ratio of 1:5.5 
for brown water : food waste [21], while a 1:1.1 BW : FW VS load ratio was reported in China 
with the 5 L BW/capita /d and 500 g FW/capita /d generation (Wang et al., 2018) . In North 
America, the reported BW : FW VS collection ratio ranged between 1:2 -1:3 in the decentralized 
household sanitation system (Zhang et al., 2019) . These variations can be associated with local 
diet and living habitats, etc., which contributed to variations in the reported treatment 
performance in addition to the different operational conditions and reactor types applied.  
Our group’s study has demon strated a 53% increase in substrate hydrolysis efficiency from 
treating only blackwater to food waste and blackwater co -substrate in batch test, yet it has not 
been evaluated in continuous UASB operation (Zhang et al., 2019) . In order to mitigate the 159 hydrolysis limitation in blackwater mono -digestion and  to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing 
UASB for a high -loading blackwater and food waste co -digestion operation, food waste was 
added into the UASB reactor previously acclimatized to vacuum toilet blackwater treatment 
(with an OLR of 4.1 kg COD/m 3/d). The amount of food waste addition was stepwise increased 
to obtain increasing OLRs. The effectiveness of the co -digestion strategy was evaluated by the 
improvement of overall biomethane recovery and OLR achieved. The information provided by 
the present work  should help to assess the environmental and economic feasibility of blackwater 
and food waste co -digestion strategy and potentially guide future decentralized waste/wastewater 
treatment system designs.  
7.2. Materials and method s 
7.2.1 Substrates  
Vacuum toilet blackwater (utilizing 1 L flushing water per flush) and food waste were collected 
from University of Alberta campus (Edmonton, Alberta). Raw food waste collected from food 
courts and student lounges was mainly composed of grains ( e.g., rice, noodle, bread), vegetable 
residuals ( e.g., broccoli, carrot, onion), fruit residuals ( e.g., banana and orange peels, apple 
cores), and beverage residuals ( e.g., tea, coffee). Food waste were manually mixed and grinded 
with an electrical kitchen blender to reduce the particle size and further mixed with handheld 
mixer to obtain substrate homogeneity. Substrates were stored at 4 °C until use. In each 
operation phase, the blackwater and food waste co -substrates were prepared at the following VS 
mixing ratios ( BW:FW): 1:0.3, 1:0.6, 1:1, and 1:1.5 for Phases I – IV, respectively (Table 7.1), 
where increasing amount of food waste was added on top of the fixed blackwater load (4.1 kg 
COD/m 3/d) to form the co -substrates. The VS concentrations of blackwater and food waste were 
measured prior to co -substrate preparation. In each co -substrate preparation, the food waste was 
added into blackwater, shaken for evenly mixing and then stored in a feedstock container 
equipped with a continuous mixing stirrer (120 rpm) (Fisher  scientific, CA) to ensure 
homogenized feeding. The feedstock container was placed in a fridge (4 °C) next to the 
bioreactor to minimize the COD loss during the storage and feeding process.   160 7.2.2 Reactor set -up and operation  
A 3.5 -L (3.3 -L working volume ) UASB reactor was operated at 35 °C with a heating blanket. 
This study followed the previous blackwater mono -digestion treatment study, for which the 
initial inoculum was obtained from the blackwater acclimatized sludge (304 days’ operation) 
with a volume  of 1 L and volatile suspended solids (VSS) concentration of 27.9 g/L. The co -
substrate was continuously pumped out from the feedstock container (4 °C) into the UASB using 
a peristaltic pump (Longer pump BT 100 -2J). The biogas and effluent were collected a t the top 
of the reactor. Daily methane generation was obtained by measuring the daily gas volume and 
the biogas contents using gas chromatography (GC) (7890B Agilent Technologies, USA). The 
height of sludge bed was constantly monitored to calculate the sl udge volume change during the 
operation. Overall, the operation lasted for 130 days and was divided into four operational 
phases. For all four phases, the operational hydraulic retention time (HRT) was maintained at 2.6 
days according to the previous optim ized results in blackwater mono -digestion. The OLR was 
increased step -wise from 5.1 (± 0.2) kg COD/m 3/d (Phase I) to 11.6 (±0.6) kg COD/m 3/d (Phase 
IV) throughout the duration of operation by increasing the food waste load on top of the 
blackwater load (4. 1 kg COD/m 3/d) (Section 2.1). The higher OLRs (while keeping the constant 
HRT) achieved can be also attributed to the stepwise substitution from blackwater to food waste 
as the major organic source in co -substrates, where the higher feedstock VS content re sulted in 
higher energy density. Each phase was operated for at least 30 days to obtain stable 
biodegradation performance, which was determined by relatively constant COD removal 
efficiencies and biomethane generation rates (Kroeker et al., 1979; Yi et al., 2014)  for at least 
two consecutive weeks in each oper ation phase.  
 
7.2.3 Sludge properties  
At the end of each operation phase, UASB sludge was collected from each port of the sludge bed 
and mixed. The sludge pH, COD, total suspended solids (TSS), and VSS were measured before 
performing batch tests to determ ine the stability and specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of the 
sludge.  
 
Specific methanogenic activity (SMA)   161 Sludge SMA batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the maximum methane production 
rate that the sludge developed throughout the reactor’s operation; SMA results were presented as 
g CH 4-COD/sludge VSS/d. In each operation phase, the test was performed with acetate or H 2 & 
CO 2 gas as precursor substrates to illustrate the methanogen production rates through acetoclastic 
or hydrogenot rophic pathways, respectively. Serum bottles with volumes of 166 mL per bottle 
were filled with the UASB mixed sludge and the substrate (sodium acetate or H 2 & CO 2 gas); the 
initial substrate concentration was designed to be 1 g/L. The pH of the mixed liqu or was adjusted 
to neutral (~7) to provide fair comparison throughout the operation. When sodium acetate was 
applied as a substrate, the headspace of the bottles was flushed with N 2 gas to provide an 
anaerobic environment. When H 2 & CO 2 was applied as a su bstrate, the bottles were flushed 
with H 2 & CO 2 gas (80% & 20% by volume, respectively). Blank controls were set -up 
simultaneously (with no added substrates and flushed with N 2 gas) to evaluate CH 4 production 
from sludge in the test group . The bottles were  sealed with rubber septums and aluminum caps 
after gas flushing and incubated at 35 °C in a shaking incubator (New Brunswick™ Innova® 44, 
Eppendorf, Canada) in dark conditions. Each group of batch test was conducted in triplicates. 
The gas production was obtained by measuring the headspace pressure using a pressure meter 
(GHM 3151, Germany) and the gas composition using GC. The SMA values were obtained from 
dividing the linear slope of methane production over the sludge VSS content in each bottle.  The 
SMA  (acetate and H2 & CO 2) results were presented with average values of the triplicate 
measurements with standard deviations.   
 
Sludge stability  
The sludge stability test was performed to evaluate the amount of biodegradable COD presented 
in the sludge whic h could be converted to methane. Testing of each group of sludge stability was 
conducted at 35 °C using freshly collected sludge samples. The experimental setup followed a 
previous study (Gao et al., 2019b) . The results of each sludge stability test are shown in g CH 4-
COD/g sludge COD with an average value of the triplicate measurements and one standard 
deviation.  Higher values indicate more biodegradable organics present in sludge, which represent 
less sludge stability.  
 162 7.2.4 Analytical methods  
The UASB influent and effluent chemical properties were measured 3 – 5 times each week, 
including the pH, total COD ( CODt ), soluble COD ( CODs ), total solids (TS), VS, total nitrogen 
(TN), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), reactive phosphorus (PO 43--P), alkalinity (as CaCO 3), and 
three main volatile fatty acids (VFAs) including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The sludge 
characteristics of pH, CODt , TSS, and VSS were measured twice in each ope ration phase as well 
as every time the sludge was discharged from the UASB. The COD, TS, VS, TSS, and VSS 
measurements were conducted following the standard methods described by American Public 
Health Association (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012) . The TN, TAN, PO 43--P, and alkalinity were 
measured using Hach TNT vial tests (Hach, USA). VFA measurements were conducted using 
ionic chromatography (IC) equipped with a conductivity detect or (DIONEX ICS -2100, 
ThermoFisher, USA). The pH was measured using a B40PCID pH meter (VWR, SympHony). 
20 L volume gas bags (Multilayer foil gas bag with Locking Combo Valve® with Septum, 
CHROMSPEC TM, Canada) were connected to the UASB reactor for biogas c ollection. The 
biogas volume was manually measured with gas tight syringe (140 mL, equipped with stopcock). 
Biogas composition was measured using a 7890B gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, 
Santa Clara, USA) equipped with a thermal conductivity detect or (TCD) and two columns 
(Molsieve 5A 2.44 m 2 mm for CH 4 and Hayesep N 1.83 m 2 mm for N 2, O 2 and CO 2). The 
temperature of the oven, injector, and detector was 100 , 150, and 200 °C, respectively. Gas 
sample was withdrawn from the UASB gas bag using the gas tight sampling syringe with ten 
times flushing to ensure the gas homogeneity and was analyzed with the GC loop injection 
method . GC injections with a fixed standard gas (known composition of 40% CH 4, 25% CO 2, 
1% O 2, 34 N 2%) (PRAXAIR, Canada) were conducted before and after biogas measurements to 
serve as a quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) check.  
7.2.5 Calculations  
Methane production and methanisation rates  
The methane production rat e was calculated from the daily methane generation (biogas volume 
multiplied by the methane fraction in biogas) (L /d) from per volume (L) of reactor and presented 
as L/L /d. The methanisation rate represents the amount of feedstock COD that was converted  163 into methane COD through the treatment process and is shown as g CH 4-COD/g feed COD as a 
percentage (%).   
 
Hydrolysis efficiency  
The hydrolysis efficiency shown in this study indicates the hydrolyzed fraction of influent solid 
COD substrates. The solid COD content was calculated by subtracting the soluble COD from 
total COD in the influent; the hydrolysis efficiency was then calculated using the following 
equation:  
𝐻𝑦𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑠  𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦  𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑠 (%)=𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝐶𝐻4+𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝑠,𝑒𝑓𝑓 𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡 −𝐶𝑂𝐷  𝑠,𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡
𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝑡,𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡 −𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝑠,𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑡 
 
Solids retention time (SRT)  
The theoretical SRT was calculated based on the amount of sludge wasted and washed out from 
the UASB (in VSS). Calculated SRT values were compared with the total operation time for 
each phase. When the theoretical SRT was longer than the practical reactor operation time, the 
real operation time was considered as the operational SRT for that phase (Metcalf and Eddy, 
2003) .  
 
COD mass balance  
For each operation phase, the amount of input  COD was partitioned into methane production 
(COD -methane), COD discharge from wasted sludge (COD -discharge), COD accumulated in 
UASB sludge bed (COD -accumulation), and residual COD in UASB effluent (COD -effluent). 
The COD mass balance was calculated in th e steady state of each operation phase.  
 
Methanogenic capacity  
The methanogenic capacity was calculated with the maximum sludge SMA and the amount of 
sludge VSS in the UASB at the steady state of each operation phase; this represents the highest 
potential methane production capability. For each operation phase, the methanogenic capacity 
was compared with the real methane production and the OLR to illustrate the process limitation.  
 
VS removal efficiency   164 The VS removal efficiency was calculated weekly as the  amount of VS removed from the 
influent VS after UASB treatment. Weekly average VS concentrations for UASB influent and 
effluent were utilized for the calculation.  
 
7.3. Results and discussion  
7.3.1 Feedstock properties  
The chemical properties of the blackwater, food waste and food waste co -substrates in each co -
digestion operation phase are presented in Table 7.1. The collected food waste contained TS and 
VS concentrations of 274.9 (± 28.7) and 241.6 (± 27.2) g VS/kg FW,  respectively, which is 
within the general reported range of 135 – 280 g VS/kg FW (Gou et al., 2014; R ajagopal et al., 
2013) . The feedstock pH values decreased from 8.5 (VS ratio 1:0.3) to 7.8 (VS ratio 1:1.5) due to 
the increasing proportion of food waste (pH 4.9) in the co -substrates. Similar food waste pH 
values ranging between 4.4 – 5.3  have been r eported in previous studies (Lavagnolo et al., 2017; 
Rajagopal et al., 2013) . The co -substrate CODt  concentration increased from 14.2 (± 0.6) to 30.5 
(± 1.7)  g/L throughout the operation; the CODs  concentration increased from 5.1 (± 0.3) to 11.6 
(± 0.8) g/L, respectively. Compared to blackwater having 32 % of the CODt  as CODs , higher 
fractions of soluble organic contents were observed in the BW -FW co -substrate with between 36 
– 38 % of the CODt  as CODs . A comparable value of 37 % has been previously reported for 
BW-FW co -substrates (Rajagopal et al., 2 013). Considering the low CODs  fraction (21 %) in 
food waste, the higher CODs  levels achieved in the co -substrate may be explained by the 
immediate hydrolysis of the solid organics after mixing blackwater and food waste (Wendland et 
al., 2007) . Consequently, the short -chain VFA generation was also enhanced, where 
concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the co -substrate drastically increased 
compared to blackwater alone (Table 7.1). Since food waste contains relatively low nitrog en 
levels (0.6 g TN/L & 0.1 g TAN/L), the TN concentrations of 2.5 – 3 g/L and the TAN 
concentrations of 1.1 g/L in co -substrates were primarily contributed by blackwater. The 
variations in TN contents were mainly due to the fluctuations in blackwater and food waste 
properties. As a result, the increased food waste proportion resulted in higher COD/TN ratios of 
the co -substrates. Compared to the blackwater COD/TN ratio of 4.1:1, the co -substrates showed 
increased values ranging from 5.6:1 to 11.0:1 in Phase s I to IV, respectively, and were closer to 
the feasible COD/TN ratios of 20:1 -40:1 demonstrated for effective anaerobic digestion (Fricke 165 et al., 2007; Speece, 2008) . The higher COD/TN ratios achieved f or the co -substrates tend to 
benefit the anaerobic treatment process with enhanced substrate digestibility. As demonstrated in 
our preliminary tests, bio -methane potential (BMP) values of 0.54 – 0.85 g CH 4-COD/g feed  
COD were obtained for BW -FW co -substra tes compared to only 0.35 – 0.48 g CH 4-COD/g feed 
COD for blackwater alone, and no CH 4 production for food waste alone (due to high VFA 
accumulation) (Gao et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2019) . The PO 43--P concentrations of co -
substrates were in the range of 24.4 (±0.9) – 34.1 (±8.5) g/L, which is comparable with the  
values for blackwater, indicating the majority contribution from blackwater. The co -substrates 
alkalinity 1.63 (±0.01) – 1.87 (±0.08) g/L  was contributed from the alkalinity of blackwater 1.99 
(±0.13) g/L , indicating the high buffer capacity of blackwater . This observation was comparable 
with previous studies that feces and urine contained high alkalinity (Lavagnolo et al., 2017) , but 
food waste treatment requires additional alkali nity for process stability (Chen et al., 2015) .

7.3.2 Organics removal 
The overall UASB treatment performance including COD removal efficiency ( Fig. 7.1A), 
effluent VFA concentrations and VFA/alkalinity ratios ( Fig. 7.1B), and methane production rate 
(Fig. 7.1C), are presented along with  the UASB effluent properties in Table 7.2.  
From Phase I-IV, the increased FW addition resulted in an increase in OLR from 5.1 (± 0.2)  to 
11.6 (± 0.6) kg COD/m 3/d (Fig. 7.1A, Table 7.1), which was 24 % - 183 % higher over the 
maximum feasible OLR ( 4.1 [± 0.4] kg COD/m 3/d) demonstrated in blackwater mono -digest ion 
(Gao et al., 2019b) . Throughout the operation, the residual COD in the effluent increased from 
2.3 (± 0.4) g/L in Phase I to 5.3 (± 0.9) g/L in Phase IV, while comparable COD removal 
efficiencies were achieved in the range of 82.4 (± 2.8) –  83.6 (± 3.6) %. It should be noted that 
in order to maintain a good effluent quality, sludge was wasted from the UASB to avoid sludge 
wash -out. Correspondingly, the total VS removal efficiencies ranged from 80.8 (± 0.1) % to 85.8 
(±0.9) % (Table 7.2). The relatively high COD removal efficiencies obtained in the food waste 
co-digestion reactor were similar to the value obtained in the previous study of blackwater mono -
digestion (84 %) (Gao et al., 2019b) . This result demonstrates that efficient organic reductions 
can be achieved under higher OLRs.  167 The level of pH, VFAs and alkalinity correlate with each other and are important for process 
stability in anaerobic digestion system. In the current study, the total VFA concentration in the 
effluent maintained at a relatively low level of 0.39 g COD/L in Phase I, where 62 % was from 
acetate residuals. When the OLR was increased to 7.0 (± 0.5) kg CO D/m 3/d in Phase II, the 
effluent VFA concentration increased to 1.15 (± 0.4) g COD/L. When the OLR was further 
increased to 10.0 (± 0.5) kg COD/m 3/d in Phase III, the effluent VFA drastically increased at an 
early stage with concentrations reaching 2.69 (±  0.5) g COD/L, indicating a temporary VFA 
accumulation, while the effluent residual VFA contents dropped to 1.67 (± 0.4) g COD/L at the 
later steady state. A temporary VFA accumulation is generally observed in shock loading 
conditions when the system has n ot been well -acclimatized to the high OLR condition (Wu et al., 
2018) . In the final operation phase where the OLR reached 11.6 (± 0.6) kg COD/m 3/d, effluent 
VFA concentrations were 2.25 (±0.53) g COD/L. Similar high VFA values have been reported in 
a CSTR system with effluent VFA concentration up to 2.6 g COD/L when the OLR reached 2 kg 
COD/m 3/d, while steady operation was still achieved due to the system’s buffering capacity 
(Wendland et al., 2007) . VFA/alkalinity ratio has been suggested as an indicator for system 
stability, where values of 0.3 -0.4 have been considered optimal and a level >0.8 may suggest 
system overloading (Wang et al., 2012) . In the current work, the ratio of VFA/alkalinity 
increased from 0.11 (± 0. 03) to 0.83 (± 0.07) with the increasing VFA concentrations and the 
decreased alkalinity (3.3 [± 0.2] g /L to 2.6 [± 0.3] g /L) from Phase I to IV. High VFA/alkalinity 
ratios of >0.8 were observed in Phase IV. Similar observations have been reported in the  co-
digestion of cattle slurry and fruit and vegetable wastes (FVW) that the VFA/alkalinity ratios 
increased to 0.4 -0.8 after FVW addition was increased to over 30% of the feed and OLR over 
4.52 kg VS/m 3/d (Callaghan et al., 2002) . pH values in all operational phases changed in a 
limited range of 7.5 (± 0.1) – 7.8 (± 0.1), which may imply that pH was le ss sensitive compared 
to the VFA/alkalinity ratios in the current condition. The VFA accumulations, decreased 
alkalinity and the increased VFA/alkalinity ratios demonstrated the potential of system instability 
after high OLRs were applied in phases III and  IV despite of the high organic removal and 
methane production achieved under such conditions.  168 Fig. 7. 1. Performance of blackwater and foodwaste  co-digestion in Phase I -IV over time, OLR

7.3.3 Biomethane production  
Effective and stabilized biomethane production was achieved after 10 days of process start -up, 
which indicated the acclimatization of biomass to the BW -FW co -substrate. In operation Phase I, 
the methane production rate was 1.17 (± 0.12) L/L /d, which was 72 % higher than the highest 
value (0.68 [± 0.08] L/L /d) demonstrated in blackwater mono -digestion. A significantly 
enhanced methanisation rate of 58.8 % of the input COD was observed; this value is 34 % higher 
than treating blackwater alone (44. 3 %). Similar to the current results, a 13 % higher 
methanisation rate was achieved in a BW -FW co -digestion system when compared to the 
treatment of blackwater alone (Wendland et al., 2007) . From Phase I to III, the amount of 170 methane generated ( 1.17 [± 0.12] –  2.42 [± 0.15] L/L /d) was linearly correlated with the OLRs 
(5.1 [± 0.2] – 10.0 [± 0.5] kg COD/m 3/d, R2 = 0.997, Fig. S7.1), with the methanisation  rates in a 
range of 58.8 – 61.9 %. The high biomethane generation can be attributed to the enhanced 
substrate properties. Food waste addition provided more readily biodegradable organics and 
balanced the substrates’ COD/TN ratio. As COD/TN ratio has been considered as one of the key 
parameters that regulates the biogas production (Vögeli et al., 2014) , the co -substrate COD/TN 
ratios 5.6:1 -9.4:1 (higher than 4.1:1 for blackwater) may have created better environmental 
conditions for microorganisms which facilitated effective methanogenesis process. However, 
when the OLR was further increased to 11.6 (± 0.6) kg COD/m 3/d in Phase IV,  the methane 
production rate decreased and gradually stabilized at 2.07 (± 0.15) L/L /d, which was ~15% lower 
than the value observed in Phase III. Correspondingly, the methanisation rates decreased to 44.4 
% in this phase. Since the methane production dire ctly correlated with the OLR, the lower value 
demonstrated that the input COD could not be effectively converted into methane under such 
high OLR, indicating an overloaded condition. Similar observations have been reported that the 
methane production decre ased under overloading conditions. For instance, i n the co -digestion 
system treating food waste and grease -trap waste, a drastic reduction in the methane yield was 
observed when the shock loading of 10.4 (±0.9) kg COD/m 3/d was applied (Wu et al., 2018) . 
Possible reasons that may contribute to the lower  methane production include the wash -out of the 
active biomass under the high OLRs and short HRT, and the limited mass transfer due to the 
accumulation of solids in the sludge bed. Although a steady methane production can be achieved 
under the overloaded O LR condition in the current study, the system suffered from organics 
overloading where unstable sludge with accumulated organics would be produced. Overall, 
Phase III demonstrated the best performance regarding both COD reduction and methane 
production was  obtained under OLR of 10.0 (± 0.5) kg COD/m 3/d.  
7.3.4 Substrate hydrolysis  
Blackwater contains high solids organics, thus the hydrolysis of these components has been 
identified as the limiting step during the anaerobic treatment process in blackwater mono -
digestion (Gao  et al., 2019b) . Fig. 7.2A shows the solid substrates hydrolysis efficiencies of the 
co-substrates throughout the whole operation. For Phases I – III, the solid organics hydrolysis 
efficiencies were 48.6 – 53.4 %, respectively, which were 69.5 – 85.9 % higher than the values  171 obtained in the sole blackwater treatment process (28.7 %). The highest hydrolysis efficiency 
was also obtained under the conditions in Phase III, which corresponded to the highest 
methanisation rate achieved. The boosted hydrolysis efficiencies may have been influenced by 
the enhanced activities of the anaerobic microorganisms in the presence of readily biodegradable 
substrates (Kim et al., 2011)  as discussed in section 3.3. In addition to the substrates properties, 
one import ant operational parameter that regulates the feedstock hydrolysis efficiency is the 
SRT, in which a sufficient amount of microbes are required for effective hydrolysis to occur (De 
Graaff et al., 2010) . In the  present study, when the overloaded condition occurred in Phase IV 
(OLR of 11.6 [±0.6] kg COD/m 3/d), frequent sludge disposal was needed due to the sludge wash 
out, which resulted in a shortened SRT that is insufficient for efficient solid substrate hydrol ysis. 
Thus, a low hydrolysis efficiency of 29.6 (± 7.5) % was observed under this operation condition.

00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.4Sludge stability
(g CH4-COD/g sludge COD) 172 Sludge stability represents the fraction of undigested biodegradable substrates in sludge. In the 
present study, the enriched sludge exhibited relatively good  stabilities with values of 0.16 (± 
0.01) to 0.14 (± 0.01) g CH 4-COD/g sludge COD ( Fig. 7.2B) in Phases I and II, respectively, 
indicating limited organic residuals in the sludge. This correlated well with the effective 
substrate hydrolysis and methane conversion observed under the operation conditions. However, 
increasing values were observed at  higher OLRs in Phases III and IV. An especially high value 
of 0.37 (± 0.00) g CH 4-COD/g sludge COD was observed in the final operation phase with the 
high OLR of 11.6 (± 0.6) kg COD/m 3/d. Poor  sludge stability ha s been reported when hydrolysis 
was the rat e limiting step (Zhang et al., 2012) . Due to the insufficient hydrolysis, solid organic 
matter accumulated in the sludge bed and replaced the active biomass (accompanied sludge 
wash -out), which can further result in reduced specific methanogenic activities of the biomass. In 
the current work, the high COD removal efficiency of 82.4 % and low substrate hydrolysis 
efficiency of 29.6 % in Phase IV implies that unhydrolyzed solid organics were entrapped in the 
UASB sludge bed under overloaded conditions, which resulted in poor sludge stability and lower 
methane generation compared with the previous phases. Sludge stabilization would be required 
before sludge final application or distribution (Zhang et al., 2012) .

The COD balances for each operation pha se are presented in Fig. 7.3. The COD output 
accounted for 100.9 – 105.1 % of the COD input, with the COD input considered to be 100 %. 
The limited differences (0.9 – 5.1 %) between influent and effluent CODs demonstrated the 
reliability of the measurements (Wu et al., 2018) . The effluent COD residuals only accounted for 
16.4 – 17.6 % of the COD input, indicating a relatively stable and effective organics removal 
through the UASB treatment. Most of the input COD (58.8 – 61.9 %) was converted into 
methane in Phases I – III, with the highest methane conversion rate of 61.9 % observ ed in Phase 
III with an OLR of 10.0 (± 0.5) kg COD/m 3/d. Compared to the blackwater treatment system 
with 44.3 % COD -methane conversion (Gao et al., 2019b) , the BW -FW co -digestion clearly 
facilitated the biomethane recovery efficiency. A decreased COD -methane conversion rate of 
44.4 % was observed in Phase IV when the system experienced overloading. More input COD 
was in sludge in Phase IV (40.7 % of the total organics input), which was signifi cantly higher 
than Phases I – III (25.8 – 29.2 %). The  discharged COD and accumulated COD inside UASB 
were 12.6 – 19.0 % and 6.9 – 13.2 % in Phases I – III, respectively. In Phase IV, 28.7 % of the 
input COD was washed out and discharged with sludge, likel y relates to the poor retention of the 
feedstock as well as the biogas generation.  The accumulated COD inside UASB accounted for 
12.0 %.  This correlated with results discussed in section 3.4 wh ere sludge stability was  poor 
under this condition.   
 
7.3.6 Sl udge specific methanogenic activity and methanogenic capacity  
Sludge methanogenic activity is generally considered to be an important parameter to help 
evaluate reactor behavior (Silvestre et al., 2014)  and to identify rate -limiting conditions (Kim et 
al., 2011) . Precursor substrates of acetate and H 2 & CO 2 are typically used to identify the 
dominant methanogenesis pathway (acetoclastic or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis). The 
results of SMA (acet ate) and SMA (H 2 & CO 2) for each operation phase are presented in Fig. 
7.4A. Throughout the entire operation of the UASB, relatively high SMA (H 2 & CO 2) values of 
0.97 (± 0.01) – 1.20 (± 0.03) g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d were achieved, which were clearly higher 
than SMA (acetate) at 0.13 (± 0.01) – 0.18 (±0.01) g CH 4-COD/g VSS /d, indicating the 
ascendancy of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway. A decreased SMA (H 2 & CO 2) 
value was observed in Phase IV due to the organics overload stress. Compared with the res ults 174 from blackwater mono -digestion, this co -digestion system generated over two -folds higher SMA 
(H2 & CO 2), though comparable SMA (acetate) values. The higher hydrogenotrophic 
methanogenic activities achieved in the co -digestion process may indicate a gr own population of 
hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the whole microbial community or a cohesive mass transfer 
between hydrogen -producing bacteria and the hydrogen -utilizing archaea, as the inoculated 
sludge was dominated by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens a s illustrated in the previous study 
(Gao et al., 2019b) . In such hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis dominated systems, the acetate 
degradation tended to be conducted through the combined syntroph ic acetate oxidation (SAO) 
and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (HM) processes, where acetate was firstly converted into 
H2 & CO 2 and then into methane (Karakashev et al., 2006; Li e t al., 2015) . Since the high SMA 
(H2 & CO 2) enables effective conversion of H 2 & CO 2 into methane, the SAO pathway tended to 
be the limiting step for acetate degradation in the present study. This is supported by the 
observed residual acetate in the UAS B effluent under high OLR conditions in the current study, 
where acetate may not be directly favored by methanogens. Similar observations have been 
previously reported in the treatment of food waste where residual propionate was frequently 
detected in the effluent when the dominant methanogenesis pathway was identified through 
utilizing acetate and butyrate (Han et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2001) . In summary, the SMA 
(acetate) and SMA (H 2 & CO 2) results observed in the current system indicate efficient 
hydrogenotrophic methanogen esis and relatively inadequate SAO activities.  
Although no SMA results have been reported in BW -FW co -digestion systems, the 
hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis dominant system has been previously reported in other food 
waste co -digestion systems. For instance, a high SMA (H 2 & CO 2) value of approximately 0.6 g 
CH 4-COD/g VS /d was observed in the co -digestion of manure and food waste in a mesophilic 
CSTR where the SMA (acetate) was only 0.06 g CH 4-COD/g VS /d (Neves et al., 2009) . It should 
be noted that t he current co -digestion process generated considerably high sludge methanogenic 
activities, which indicates a faster methane generation rate over blackwater mono -digestion 
system. A similar demonstration has also been made in the co -digestion of food waste  and raw 
sludge (primary and secondary sludge); not only the methane yield was elevated but also the 
methane production rate was accelerated by the co -digestion strategy (Koch et al.,  2015) .  175 Fig. 7. 4. UASB sludge specific methanogenic activity (SMA [H 2 & CO 2], SMA [Acetate]) (A); 
UASB methanogenic capacity and OLR (kg COD/m 3/d) (B).  
The methanogenic capacity was calculated based on the sludge SMA (H 2 & CO 2) and the total 
amount of VSS in the UASB reactor at the end of each operation phase; this represents the 
maximum methane production capacity that the system can demonstrate under each operational 
condition. Methanogenic capacities of 16.4 (±1.9) – 24.3 (±0.3) kg CH 4-COD/m 3/d (Fig. 7.4B) 
were observed in Phases I -IV, which were 2.1 – 3.2 times of the OLRs (5.1 [±0.2] – 11.6 [±0.6] 
kg COD/m 3/d) in each operation phase . The increase in methanogenic capacities can be 
attributed to the increasing amount o f VSS in the UASB reactor, indicating biomass growth. The 
highest methanogenic capacity observed in the final operation phase further verifies that the low

7.3.7 Evaluation on blackwater and food waste co -digestion  
Energy conservation is the key in the decentralized wastewater treatment approach. An energy 
saving of ~40kWh/ca pita/year may be obtained through wastewater source -diversion and 
anaerobic treatment (Capodaglio and Olsson, 2020; Vaccari et al., 2018; Wendland et al., 2007; 
Zeeman et al., 2008) . In this sanitation system, the anaerobic BW -FW co -digestion exhibited 
substantial advantages due to high biomethane generation.

*: calculated values.  177 Blackwater contains feces (undigested food and biomass [25 – 54% of dry mass in feces]) (Rose 
et al., 2015) , urine, and often toilet papers. It exhibits relatively low C/N ratio and high solids 
organic matter, therefore, is not a desirable substrate for anaerobic digesters. Meanwhile, 
biomethane recovery from food w aste was challenged by fast VFA accumulation and pH drop 
(Capson -Tojo et al., 2018) . The food waste and blackwater co -digestion have triggered the 
advantageous synergistic effects, which facilitated the biomethane production. In addition to the 
readily biodegradable substrates suppl y (Lay et al., 1997)  and a  more balanced substrate C/N 
ratio (Kumar et al., 2010) , enhanced microbial growth and  activities (Kim et a l., 2011; Mata -
Alvarez et al., 2000)  were observed in this study. Up to 85.9% increase in substrate hydrolysis 
efficiency through food waste co -digestion resulted in a higher biomethane generation of 2.42 
L/L/d and higher OLR of 10.0 kg COD/m 3/d compare d with blackwater mono -digestion with 
0.68 L/L /d and 4.1  kg COD/m 3/d, respectively .  
As described in Table 7.3, previous studies have evaluated the bioenergy recovery efficacy from 
blackwater and food waste co -digestion using various types of operation sys tems. The current 
study is the first work evaluating the feasibility of utilizing UASB reactor for blackwater and 
food waste co -digestion under high OLRs. Throughout the UASB operation, the solids 
concentrations of 7.5 -18.9 g TSS/L (Table S 7.1) for the co -substrates were within the suggested 
limits for applying UASB treatment (TSS<3%) (Abbasi et al., 2012) , and it did not affect the 
smooth operation of the anerobic process. Compared to previous studies, the current work 
achieved relatively high C OD removal, the highest methane production rate and OLR, which 
was 2.4 times of the highest OLR (4.1 kg COD/m 3/d) in the reported work. The higher OLR 
indicates less reactor volume requirement, thus lower capital cost. The methane generation of 
2.42 L/L /d achieved in the current work represents a heat recovery potential of 96.8 MJ/m 3 
reactor /d (2.35 kWh/kg COD input) ( methane heat value 40 MJ/m 3, (Zhang et al., 2018) ), which 
could assist the feedstock heat -up in wastewater treatment facilities and support neighborhood 
energy supply (Gao et al., 2019b) . In addition, the optimal BW :FW VS ratio of 1:1 obtained in 
the present study resembles the practical collection ratios of 1:1.1 -1:3 (BW:FW in VS) (Kujawa -
Roeleveld et al., 2005; Rajagopal et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2018; Wendl and et al., 2007) , 
indicating its feasibility in practical application. It is important to notice that the large quantities 
of global food waste production (1.3 billion tons annually (“Key facts on food l oss and waste 178 you should know!,” 2019) ) and the human excreta (5 L/capita /d blackwater using vacuum toilet 
(Wendland e t al., 2007) ) generation ensure a sustainable bioenergy resource.  
Accordingly, the results obtained in the current work demonstrated a highly efficient and cost -
effective method of treating source -diverted household wastewater, the high bioenergy recov ery, 
waste treatment capacity, low construction and operational cost supported the feasibility of 
performing full -scale application with this strategy.  
7.4. Conclusions  
High -loading blackwater and food waste co -digestion was investigated using a UASB rea ctor 
with an HRT of 2.6 days at 35 °C. Substantial enhancement in biomethane recovery was 
achieved through stepwise increases of the food waste addition into blackwater. An OLR 
threshold was identified to be 10.0 (±0.5) kg COD/m 3/d when the co -substrate mi xing ratio of 
1:1 (BW:FW in VS) was applied in order to avoid process failure. Under this condition, the 
substrate methanisation rate and hydrolysis efficiency were 39.9 % and 85.9 % higher than the 
values observed from blackwater mono -digestion. A maximum  methane production rate of 2.42 
(± 0.15) L/L /d was achieved, which is the highest value in blackwater and food waste co -
digestion reported to date. Insufficient sludge retention limited the biomethane recovery when 
OLR was further elevated to 11.6 (± 0.6)  kg COD/m 3/d, leading to increased COD accumulation. 
Outstanding sludge hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activities of 0.97 (± 0.01) – 1.20 (± 0.03) g 
CH 4-COD/g VSS /d were achieved through blackwater and food waste co -digestion, which was 
up to 2.4 times high er than the blackwater mono -digestion process. The overall remarkable 
performance was likely due to better feedstock properties and subsequent boosted microbial 
activities.

 186 CHAPTER 8. ROLE OF SYNTROPHIC ACETATE OXIDATION AND 
HYDROGENOTROPHIC METHANOGENESIS IN CO -DIGESTION OF 
BLACKWATER WITH FOOD WASTE  
8.1. Introduction  
Compared with blackwater mono -digestion, anaerobic co -digestion (AcoD) with food waste has 
great potential to help mitigate the limitations and gain more energ y benefits (Lim et al., 2013) . 
The readily biodegradable organics and the high carbon but low nitrogen content of food waste 
can help enable better substrate hydrolysis and more balanced carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratios of 
the co -substrate than treating only blackwater. To date, UASB reactors have never been tested 
for blackwater and food waste co -digestion, although it has been widely demonstrated that the 
UASB reactor design enables higher  OLRs and biodegradation efficiencies as compared to 
configurations su ch as CSTR (Daud et al., 2018) . 
In the current study, we performed a continuous anaerobic co -digestion on blackwater and food 
waste using a UASB reactor under mesophilic condition (35°C). The objectives of this work are 
to (i) demonstrate high -rate blackwater and food waste co -digestion using the UASB reactor and 
(ii)illustrate the associated microb ial community structure development. Increasing OLRs were
achieved by stepwise increasing food waste proportions in the co -substrates until reaching the 
threshold. The dynamic shifts of the microbial community structures were correlated with the 
changed su bstrate properties and the applied OLRs and linked to the treatment performances. To 
the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first study that elucidates the microbial interactions 
in blackwater and food waste UASB treatment system. The crucial info rmation provided could 
help guide the future design of the new sanitation system, especially for the household 
wastewater collection patterns.  
8.2. Materials and method  
8.2.1 Substrates collection and reactor operation  
Vacuum toilet flushed blackwater (with 1 L flushing water per flush) and food waste (from 
cafeteria and student lounge) were collected from the University of Alberta campus (Edmonton, 
Canada). Both substrates were ground using an electric kitchen blender t o achieve homogeneity, 187 then stored at 4°C prior to use. An upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor with a 
working volume of 3.3 L was operated at 35°C (using a heating blanket) for the anaerobic 
treatment. The overall operational period was divided into five phases according to the different 
feeding substrates and organic loading rate (OLR) conditions adopted in each phase. The 
inoculum sludge (1 L, volatile suspended solids [VSS] 27.9 g/L ) was obtained from a UASB 
reactor treating vacuum toilet blac kwater (Gao et al., 2019b) . In phase I, following the previous 
blackwater treatment operational condition, the UASB reactor was fed with only blackwater at 
an OLR of 4.1 kg COD/m 3/d. From phas es II to V, the co -substrates of mixed blackwater and 
food waste were fed into the UASB reactor; the feeding substrates were prepared with increasing 
food waste volatile solids (VS) proportions in the co -substrates with the values of 23%, 38%, 
50%, and 60%  (Table 8.1). Throughout the whole operation, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) 
was fixed at 2.6 days with an upflow velocity of 5.210-3 m/h, and the increment in the organic 
loading rate for each operational phase was contributed from the increasing fee dstock chemical 
oxygen demand (COD) concentrations. Phase I (blackwater mono -digestion) lasted for 21 days, 
and each of the other operational phases (Phases II -V, co -digestion) lasted for more than 30 days. 
Sludge was discharged from the reactor once per w eek for Phases I -IV and twice per week 
during Phase V. The sludge bed height was maintained at 17 cm (i.e., half the reactor height) 
throughout the operation with sludge discharge.    
8.2.2 Chemical analysis  
The influent feed samples and the UASB effluent samples were collected and measured three to 
five times each week for the detections of total COD (COD t), soluble COD (COD s), total 
nitrogen (TN), total ammonium nitrogen concentration, pH and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) 
including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. The total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) 
concentrations of the influent and UASB effluent were measured one to two times per week. The 
sludge properties including COD, total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS) 
and pH wer e measured at the end of each operational phase and at each time the sludge was 
wasted from the reactor. The measurements of COD, TS, VS, TSS, VSS were according to the 
standard methods and conducted in triplicate (APHA/AWWA/WEF, 2012) . Hach TNT vial test 
methods ( Hach, USA ) were applied for the measurements of total nitrogen (TN) and total 
ammonium nitrogen concentrations. The methane production was obtained from the  188 measurements of the produced biogas amount in the gas bag, and the biogas composition using 
gas chromatograp hy (GC) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (7890B Agilent 
Technologies, USA). Biogas composition was measured in duplicate. A fixed standard gas with a 
known composition of 40% CH 4, 25% CO 2, 1% O 2 and 34% N 2 (PRAXAIR, Canada) was used 
to calibrate GC before and after biogas measurements for quality control. The methane 
production rate was then calculated as the daily methane production volume per volume reactor 
and represented as m 3/m3/d. The methanisation rate in this study represented the  fraction of 
influent COD converted into methane and represented as g CH 4 /g feed COD in percentage (%) 
(the g CH 4 production was converted into g COD for calculation). A B40PCID pH meter (VWR, 
SympHony) was used to measure pH values. An ionic chromatograp hy (IC) equipped with a 
conductivity detector (DIONEX ICS -2100, ThermoFisher, USA) was used for measuring VFA 
concentrations. A series of VFA standard mixtures in different concentrations were used for 
method calibration and check.    
 
Isotopic detection on  biogas was performed for each operational phase using GC 5890 Series II 
(Hewlett Packard, USA) at the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University 
of Alberta. The stable carbon isotopic signature 𝛅 13CH 4 (‰) and 𝛅13CO 2 (‰) were obtained 
from the GC measurement and were utilized to calculate the apparent fractionation factor 𝛂c 
using the following equation (Hao et al., 2017) : 
𝛼𝑐=(𝛿13𝐶𝑂2+103)
(𝛿13𝐶𝐻4+103) 
 
The solids COD hydrolysis efficiency represents the hydrolyzed fraction of influent solid organic 
contents, which was calculated  using the following equation:  
𝐻𝑦𝑑𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑦𝑠𝑖𝑠  𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦  𝑜𝑓 𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑑𝑠 (%)=𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝐶𝐻4+𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝑠,𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡 −𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝑠,𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡
𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝑡,𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑡 −𝐶𝑂𝐷 𝑠,𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑡 
8.2.3 Microbial community analysis  
Triplic ated sludge sampling from each port of the UASB sludge bed was performed for DNA 
extraction at the end of each operational phase. Fresh well -mixed sludge sample was centrifuged 
at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and after discarding the supernatant, the pellet was used for DNA  189 extraction following the manufacturer’s protocol using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN, 
Hilden, Germany). The qualities of the extracted DNA samples were checked through Nano Drop 
One (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). The DNA samples were stored at -20°C before downstream 
analysis. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed with the universal primer pair 357wF  
(5’-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG -3’) and 785R  (5’-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC -3’) for 
bacteria and 517F  (5’-GCYTAAAGSRNCCGTAGC -3’) and 909R  (5’-
TTTCAGYCTTGCGRCCGTAC -3’) for archaea. The genes amplification and sequencing were 
performed in the sequencing center RTL Genomics (Texas, USA).  
 
The raw sequences achieved from the sequencing center we re processed using the Qiime2 
pipelines (Caporaso et al., 2010)  with DADA2 plugin (Callahan et al., 2016)  to remove the low -
quality sequences and chimeras. Taxonomy was  assigned using the 99% similarity with the 
Greengenes (version 13_8) reference database (Werner et al., 2012) .

  191 8.3.1 Treatment performances of blackwater mono -digestion and food waste and 
blackwater co -digestion  
 
Table 8.1 showed the operational conditions, UASB influent and effluent properties, and 
treatment performances in blackwater mono -digestion (Phase I) and blackwater and food waste 
co-digestion (Phases II -V) processes. Fig. 8.1 showed the average methane production  rates in 
each operational phase; the values obtained in the co -digestion Phases II -V were compared with 
the results from blackwater mono -digestion Phase I. The influent COD concentration was 11.0 
(±0.9)  g/L for blackwater only, and increasing values from 14.2 (±0.6) to  30.5 (±1.7)  g/L were 
obtained for blackwater and food waste co -substrates with increasing food waste volatile solids 
(VS) proportions. The influent VFA concentrations in the co -substrates were more than doubled 
over the amount achieved from only blackwater, which was due to the readily biodegradable 
substrates in food waste that enables fast hydrolysis (Kim et al., 2011) . Further, food waste 
additions resulted in higher COD/TN ratios of 100:18 -100:9 of the co -substrates compared to 
blackwater alone of 100:24. Effluent pH decreased from 8.0 in mono -digestion to 7.8 -7.5 in the 
co-digestion period, which led to the reductions in the free ammonia (FA) concentrations from 
146.1 mg/L to 83.9 -46.5 mg/L. With these improved reaction environmen tal factors, significant 
enhancements in biomethane recovery were obtained, where 33 -40% increases in the substrate 
methanisation rate and 72 -256% increases in the methane production rates (Fig. 8.1) were 
achieved in co -digestion Phases II -IV over blackwat er mono -digestion. The solids COD 
hydrolysis efficiencies ranging at 46.6 -53.4% in co -digestion Phases II -IV were considerably 
higher than mono -digestion of 28.7%, which contributed to the elevated methanisation rates. The 
highest methanisation rate of 61. 9% was obtained in Phase IV under the OLR of 10.0 kg 
COD/m 3/d, which resulted in a methane production rate of 2.42 m3/m3/d that was  256% higher 
than the value obtained from blackwater mono -digestion (0.68 m3/m3/d). When the OLR was 
further increased to 11. 6 kg COD/m 3/d with food waste VS proportion of 60% in the co -
substrate , a decreased substrate hydrolysis efficiency 29.6% and a reduced methane production 
rate 2.07 m 3/m3/d was obtained, which indicated an overloaded condition. Increased effluent 
VFAs conc entrations of 2.25 g/L were observed under such a condition. The reduced substrate 
hydrolysis and the increased effluent VFAs under the overloaded condition could be attributed to 
the insufficient sludge retention. The overloaded solid organics accumulated  in sludge bed,  192 which may have caused significant loss of active biomass during sludge discharge and wash out. 
The low sludge retention time can then lead to insufficient solid organics hydrolysis and the loss 
of acids consuming microbes, eventually result ed in the decreased methane production in Phase 
V. The  COD removal efficiencies of 82.4 -83.6% obtained throughout the co -digestion period 
were comparable as the value of 83.6% achieved in treating blackwater alone. Overall, the 
threshold feasible OLR for b lackwater and food waste co -digestion was demonstrated to be 10 
kg COD/m 3/d, which is 2.44 times over the highest OLR achieved from blackwater mono -
digestion (4.1 kg COD/m 3/d).

waste co -digestion systems

developments in the blackwater mono -digestion, and blackwater and food waste co -digestion 
conditions.

blackwater (BW) mono -digestion Phase  I, and blackwater and food waste (FW) co -digestion 
Phases II, III, IV and V. Communities were analyzed at the genus level.  
 
The total number of genus enriched in archaeal and bacterial communities and their rank 
abundance distributions were shown in Fig.  8.2. In Fig. 8.2A, the numbers of total enriched 
archaeal genera increased from 11 in blackwater mono -digestion to 12 -13 in blackwater and food 
waste co -digestion systems; Phases III and V exhibited steeper gradients than the other phases, 
and the first r anked genus accounted for 60% of the total archaeal abundance in these two 
phases, demonstrating mono -enrichment under such conditions. In Fig. 8.2B, the total numbers 
of bacterial genera increased in co -digestion Phases II -IV (130 -147) compared to the bla ckwater 
mono -digestion condition in Phase I (122), while a decrease was observed in the last operational 
phase (88) under organic overloaded condition. For the first 15 bacterial genera distributions, 
Phase I and III generated similar steep slopes , demonst rating the highest abundance of the first 
ranked bacterial genus.  
 
The Gini coefficients were used to evaluate the evenness of the communities (Werner et al., 
2014)  and the results are shown in Fig. 8.2C. The values for archaea varied in a range of 0.88 -
0.90 in all phases except in Phase II where a lower value of 0.84 was obtained, indicating the 
highest evenness of the archaeal community in Phase II compared to the other operational 
conditions. The eve nness of bacterial communities varied from phase to phase, and relatively 
lower evenness (higher Gini coefficients) were observed in Phases III and V in the co -digestion 
system. The Shannon index changed in similar trends for archaeal and bacterial communi ties, 
where the values increased from Phase I to Phase II and decreased in Phases III -V. The increased 
diversity of microbial communities in Phase II (with higher Shannon index and more genera 
richness) could be due to the improved environmental conditions , such as lower free ammonia 
concentration compared to mono -digestion condition (Xu et al., 2018) , and the lower diversity in 
Phase V  indicated a higher stress level, which may be due to the high OLR applied. 
Concurrently, lower solid substrate hydrolysis efficiency and methane production were observed 
under such an overloaded condition.   194

Bacteria genus level 195 Enriched bacterial consortia   
The enriched bacterial communities with any of the abundance >1% were presented in Fig. 8.3, 
with the consortia assigned at phyla (p_) and genus (g_) levels. The blackwater mono -digestion 
system in Phase I was dominated by phyla Bacteroidetes (41.0%), Firmicutes (27.0%) and 
Proteobacteria (11.6%), which, as hydrolytic -fermentative bacteria (Guo et al., 2015) , have been 
reported in human fecal microbiota (Harmsen et al., 2002) , and in anaerobic bioreactors, e.g. 
treating biosolids. Genus Bacteroides  (28.3%) from phyla Bacteroidetes  was specifically 
enriched and dominated the bacterial community; they are well -known as  mesophilic hydrolytic -
fermentative bacteria and are capable of producing acids, ethanol and H2 and CO 2 (Murray et al., 
1984) . Compared to blackwater mono -digestion, in the co -digestion condition in Phase II, 
decreases in phyla Bacteroidetes  (14.8%) and Proteobacteria (4.2%) were observed while 
bacterium from phyla Chloroflexi (17.2%), WWE1  (10.5%),  Tenericutes (6.3%) and 
Verrucomicrobia (5.6%)  were enriched. Firmicutes (29.7%) exhibited comparable abundance as 
in blackwater mono -digestion con dition and remained predominant. Genus Bacteroides  showed 
a considerable reduction in Phase II (4.5%) which was consistent with the reported study that the 
abundances of Bacteroides  negatively related to the methane yield in the co -digestion of food 
waste and pig manure (Jiang et al., 2019) . It has been reported that a positive correlation existed 
between the increase in Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes  ratio and the methane yield (Chen et al., 2016) , 
which is in accordance with the cur rent study that with a 3 times higher Firmicutes/ 
Bacteroidetes ratio in Phase II, a 34% increase in the methanisation rate was obtained compared 
to Phase I. The enrichments of phyla WWE1 have been reported related to lignocellulosic 
substrates (Limam et al., 2014) , which correlates well with the increased cellulosic content from 
food waste addition. Bacterial genus T78 (17.1%) from phyla Chloroflexi  was found specifically 
enriched in Phase II. This bacterial group has been detected in anaerobic dige sters treating waste 
activated sludge under mesophilic conditions (Kirkegaard et al., 2017) , and has been found 
functional of degrading carbohydrates and alcohols through syntrophic interactions (Praveckova 
et al., 2016) . It has been suggested that family Anaerolinaceae , which genus T78 were assigned 
to, can coopera te with hydrogenotrophic methanogens for hydrogen scavenging (Yamada and 
Sekiguchi, 2018) . The enrichment and dominance of bacterial genus T78 in the co -digestion 
system may have accompanied more cohesive and coordi nately interactions between  196 fermentative and methanogenic microorganisms (Satoh et a l., 2007) , which indicated enhanced 
metabolic activities compared to blackwater mono -digestion system.  
 
With the increasing food waste addition in Phases II -V, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and 
Chloroflexi remained the most dominant bacterial phyla, while  variations in their relative 
abundances were observed. Bacteria groups from phyla WWE1, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, and 
Verrucomicrobia all showed reduced abundances with the increasing OLRs in Phases III -V 
compared to Phase II. Genus T78 showed the high est abundance (34.7%) in Phase III (FW VS 
38%), then gradually decreased to 23.2% and 18.7% in the last two phases. Since bacteria from 
genus T78 function in the hydrolytic -acidogenic process (Wang et al., 2016) , their reduction may 
possibly be affected by the high organic loading stress, where the amount of slow -growing SAO 
bacteria could be reduced by sludge  loss. An uncultured genus from order Bacteroidales showed 
increasing abundances from 4.3% to 14.5% in co -digestion Phases II -V, while decreased 
abundances of an uncultured genus from order Clostridiales from 7.8% (Phase II) and 8.7% 
(Phase III) to 4.7% (Phase IV) and 3.6% (Phase V) were observed. As Bacteroidales  was more 
active than Clostridiales in the biodegradation of cellulose (Xia et al., 2018) , their enrichment 
could be due to the increasing food waste proportions. It was found that an uncultured bacterial 
genus fr om order Fusobacteriales (3.6%) was specifically enriched in Phase IV (FW VS 50%), 
and an uncultured bacterial genus from class Endomicrobia (4.7%), genus Parabacteroides  
(4.6%) and bacterial genus Blautia  (8.5%) were specifically enriched in Phase V. Blautia from 
family Lachnospiraceae  have commonly been isolated from human fecal samples, which can 
function as acetogens to produce various types of fermentative products such as short -chain fatty 
acids (SCFAs). It should be noted that a negative correlation has been reported between its 
abundance and acetate concentrations (Org et al., 2017) . In the current study, the specific 
enrichment of genus Blautia  was observed under the organic overloaded condition wit h 
relatively high acetate concentrations.  
 
Enriched archaeal consortia    
The archaeal community development throughout the operation is presented at order (o_) and 
genus (g_) levels in Fig. 8.4. Methanogens from o rder Methanomicrobiales  accounted for over 
97% abundances in Phases I and III -V, while the order Methanobacteriales (4.8%) and  197 Methanomicrobiales (93.5%) dominated in Phase II . Both of these groups were 
hydrogenotrophic archaeal consortia that produce methane through CO 2 reducti on with electrons 
from H 2 (Wilkins et al., 2015) ; they have generally been detected in digesters treating sewage 
sludge and agriculture organics like silage (Demirel, 2014) . Compared to acetoclastic 
methanogens, the hydrogenotrophic methanogens were generally reported with better adaptation 
to harsh environmenta l conditions, such as high ammonia stress, VFAs, sulfides, etc. and under 
high or over -load conditions (Westerholm and Schnürer, 2019) , which was mainly attributed to 
their morphologic structures with smaller surfaces (Liu et al., 2016) . In blackwater only 
condition (Phase I), the most abundant consortia were from genus Methanogenium  (52.0%), 
followed by genus Methanolinea  (33.7%), Methanoculleus  (7.4%), and Methanospirillum  
(4.5%). Methanogenium  has been observed in chicken feces (Miller and Wolin, 1986) , anaerobic 
bioreactors treating indust rial wastewaters (Zellner et al., 1990)  and swine manure (Qin et al., 
2013) , and in blackwater digestion (Gao et al., 2019a) . Methanolinea  were commonly observed 
in anaerobic bioreactors treating organic wastes such as animal manure (Yıldırım et al., 2017) , 
sewage sludge (Wu et al., 2013)  and etc. After food waste was fed, both genus Methanogenium  
and Methanolinea  showed decreased abundanc es. Especially, the relative abundances of genus 
Methanogenium  gradually decreased with the increasing food waste addition, which could be 
correlated with the reduction of free ammonia concentration from 146.1 mg/L in blackwater 
mono -digestion Phase I to 5 3.2 mg/L in co -digestion Phase V, despite the OLR was more than 
two times higher. This indicated that the enrichment of genus Methanogenium might be 
positively correlated to free ammonia concentrations.  
 
In the co -digestion period, the dominant methanogen ic consortia shifted to genus 
Methanoculleus , uncultured genus from family Methanospirillaceae and genus Methanolinea . 
The abundances of genus Methanolinea  fluctuated within 8.8 -14.2% in Phases II -V. Genus 
Methanoculleus  and uncultured genus from family Methanospirillaceae  showed major 
dominances with relative abundances varied from phase to phase. In Phase II, the relative 
abundance of 46.1% was detected for Methanoculleus  and 33.3% for Methanospirillaceae , while 
the abundance of Methanoculleus  decreased t o 21.1% and Methanospirillaceae  increased to 
59.6% in Phase III. Then in Phases IV and V under high OLRs, the abundances of 
Methanoculleus  gradually increased to 44.4% and 60.4% and over competed  198 Methanospirillaceae  whose abundances were 42.2% and 28.8%. B oth Methanoculleus (Guo et 
al., 2014)  and Methanospirillaceae (Han et al., 2017)  have been previousl y reported in food 
waste mono -digestion and co -digestion systems. Methanogens from Methanospirillaceae have 
been identified with high H 2 utilization rates (Li et al., 2015) , which resulted in faster methane 
productions in the co -digestion period. Compared with Methanospirillaceae , methanogens from 
Methanoculleus  have a lower H 2 threshold, which was less advantageous in H 2 consumption 
(Shigematsu et al., 2006) . Further, the  enrichment of Methanoculleus has commonly been 
correlated with the stressful environmental conditions such as high ammonia concentrations and 
the increasing OLRs, etc. (De Francisci et al., 2015) . These reported results helped explain the 
dominance of Methanoculleus  under the high OLRs conditions in the current study. 
Contradictory res ults have been reported on the correlations between process stability and the 
abundance of Methanoculleus , where for a co -digestion system treating wheat straw and dairy 
cattle manure, Methanoculleus  was correlated with enhanced process stability (Song and Zhang, 
2015) , while others reported their dominance during process deterioration (Li et al., 2015) . In the 
current work, the community shift from Methanogenium  in blackwater mono -digestion condition 
to Methanoculleus  and Methanospirillaceae , in food waste co -digestion conditions may indicate 
a better metabolic environment, while the increasing abundances of Methanoculleus  
accompanied system instability in the fi nal phases (Phase IV and V) may be attributed to the 
stress from high OLRs. It should be noted that a relatively high abundance of Methanoculleus 
has been reported in the co -digestion of food waste and brown water (only feces) (Lim et al., 
2013) . Overall, in  both stable and deteriorative phases, methanogenic community structures 
showed no distinguished changes, while distinct differences existed in the relative abundances of 
each enriched methanogen genus; similar observation has been reported in the previous  study 
(Xu et al., 2018) .  199

The methanogenesis process was usually conducted through two major pathways, where 
acetoclastic methanogens utilize acetate through acetoclastic methanogenesis (AM) pathway and 
hydrogenotrophic methanogens utilize H 2 & CO 2 through hydrogenotrophic methanog enesis 
(HM) pathway for methane generation (Lim et al., 2013) . Methanosaeta  and Methanosarcina  are 
two methanogen consortia capable of performing acetoclastic methanogenesis (Hattori, 2008) . 
Instead of the acetoclastic pathway, acetate can be converted to methane through combi ned 
syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (HM) without the 
presence of the above two acetoclastic methanogenic groups, which have been realized of 
significance in anaerobic bioreactors (Hao et al., 2011) . Various types of environmental factors 
such as ammonia, tempe rature, VFAs, pH, etc. have been reported correlated with the 
establishment of the SAO -HM pathway (Lü et al., 2013) . Especially, stressful reaction conditions 
with high ammonia concentration or high VFAs accumulation could contribute to the community 
shift towards this pathway (Karakashev et al., 2006) . Due to the unfavorable thermodynamic 
properties of the SAO pathway ( G=+104.6 kJ/mol), this reaction can only proceed with the 
accompany of H 2 consuming methanogenesis ( G=-135.6 kJ/mol) to make the overall SAO -HM 
process feasible ( G=-31.0 kJ/mol) (Hattori, 2008) . 
 
The stable carbon isotopic signature 𝛅13CH 4 (‰) and 𝛅13CO 2 (‰) and the apparent fractionation 
factor 𝛂c are often utilized to illustrate the methanogenic pathways in anaerobic bioreactors (Hao 
et al., 2011) . Fig. 8.5 shows the values obtained from each operational condition. Values of 
𝛅13CH 4 (‰), 𝛅13CO 2 (‰) and 𝛂c obtained in each phase in the co -digestion period were higher 
than that from the mo no-digestion condition. The 𝛅13CH 4 (‰) values were within a narrow range 
of -45.15 ‰  to -49.65‰ throughout the operation, while the 𝛅13CO 2 (‰) values generated an 
increasing trend from -4.59 ‰ to 5.68 ‰ from Phase I to III, then decreased to 0.97‰ and 0. 48 
‰ at the high OLRs conditions. The apparent fractionation factor 𝛂c generated a similar trend 
with the changes in 𝛅 13CH 4 (‰) and 𝛅13CO 2 (‰) with the values increased from 1.047 to 1.056 
(Phases I to III) after the food waste addition then decreased to 1.048 (Phase IV) and 1.050 
(Phase V) under higher OLRs. As suggested by the reported studies, compared to acetoclastic 
methanogenesis, the isotope fractionation in hydrogenotrophic pathways would generate elevated 
𝛅13CO 2 (‰) (Lü et al., 2013) . The higher 𝛅13CO 2 (‰) values obtained in the co -digestion period  201 may indicate a more active HM process compared to the mono -digestion condition. Further, the 
apparent fractionation factors have been utilized to differentiate the dominant methanogenic 
pathways, with values 𝛂c <1.027 for AM and 𝛂c >1.065 for HM (Conrad, 2005) . The values 
obtained throughout the whole treatment (Phases I -V) in the present work were within a range of 
1.047 to 1.056, which indicated a SAO -HM pathway.

fractionation factor 𝛂c for biogas samples collected at different operational phases for blackwater

III, IV, and V.  
 
It has been commonly reported that bacteria from phylum Firmicutes, Sy nergistetes and 
Chloriflexi could be correlated with the syntrophic acid oxidation (Ruiz -Sánchez et al., 2018) . It 
has also been observed that another bacterial phylum Spirochaetes may be involved in the SAO -
HM pathway (Lee et al., 2015) . All of the above bacterial consortia were enriched in the current 
study, especially with Firmicutes 26.0 -33.7% and Chloroflexi 2.6 -35.0% dominated the system 
throughout the operation.  Increased abundances of these bacterial consortia from Phase I to II,  
e.g. 2.6% to 17.2% for Chloroflexi and 1.1% to 5.0% for Spirochaetes, were observed with food 
waste addition, which could be due to the more available acetate produced through the enhanced 
substrate hydrolysis. The enriched bacterium from order Clostridia les, genus Syntrophomonas,  
Syntrophus , and T78 have been reported correlated with syntrophic acetate/VFAs oxidation 
(Westerholm and Schnürer, 2019) . Clostridiales (3.6 -8.7%) and T78 (17.1 -34.7%) showed high 
abundances in the co -digestio n period. As for methanogenic communities, both 
 202 Methanospirillaceae (Briones et al., 2009)  and Methanoculleus (Zhao et al., 2017)  have been 
reported to have cooperated with syntrophic bacteria in VFAs degradation. Interestingly, it was 
observed that the bacterial groups Clostridiales and T78 shifted simultaneously with 
methanogenic  group Methanospirillaceae , but opposite to Methanoculleus in the co -digestion 
period. This phenomenon may imply a synergistic correlation that existed between Clostridiales, 
T78, and Methanospirillaceae . As SAO are slow growers, the SRT impact on SAO -HM capacity 
can be significant; sufficient sludge retention is required to ensure effective acetate degradation 
(Sun et al., 2014) . In the current work, the sludge loss under overloaded condition i n Phases V 
reduced the SAO capacity , which resulted in the higher residual VFAs. The simultaneous 
reduction in abundances of the SAO bacteria Clostridiales and T78, and the HM methanogens 
Methanospirillaceae  under high OLRs might contribute to the impairme nt of SAO -HM 
capability. Overall, the shifts of microbial groups involved in the SAO -HM process may 
correlate with the different environmental factors adopted, i.e. for blackwater, the main stress 
was from the high free ammonia concentration while in the c o-digestion operation period, more 
stress was from the high OLRs.  
 
8.4. Conclusions and implications  
The current results demonstrated the apparent economic benefits of performing blackwater and 
food waste co -digestion using a UASB reactor. An OLR of 10 kg  COD/m 3/d and methane 
production of 2.42 m 3/m3/d were achieved in this study, which is  higher than the bioenergy 
recovery efficiencies for blackwater and food waste co -digestion reported previously. Only 0.02 
m3/person of reactor volume is required using t he current strategy for anaerobically treating 
source -diverted blackwater and food waste, indicating lower capital costs required as compared 
with other reported systems (0.05 -1 m 3/person). It was also concluded that the combined SAO -
HM methanogenic pathwa y played a key role in achieving effective biomethane production in 
blackwater and food waste treatment. The enhanced feeding substrate properties including 
VFAs, C/N ratios, and the environmental factors of free ammonia concentrations and pH values 
synerg istically contributed to the enrichment of highly active microbial consortia with bacterial 
genus T78, and uncultured methanogenic genus from family Methanospirillaceae  in the co -
digestion system. Their simultaneously dynamic shifts during the co -digestion  period indicated a 
syntrophic functional relationship. Methanogens from genus Methanoculleus showed   203 predominance under overloaded (11.6 kg COD/m 3/d in Phase V) condition in the co -digestion 
period, which illustrated its correlation with process deterioration. The dynamic shifts of 
Methanoculleus  during the operation period also indicated that the early -stage community shift 
may be indicators of the  process overloading.  
 
It should be noted that the microbiota information as key performance indicators awaits more 
practical utilization. The knowledge provided by the current work can help with future 
operational design and process optimization in new s anitation systems for the treatment of 
source -diverted domestic wastewater.

   211 CHAPTER 9. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
9.1 Thesis Overview  
The current applied centrali zed sanitation system is not compatible with the goal of sustainable 
development. Large amounts of water and energy are consumed for transporting and treating 
waste/pollutants; pathogens are conveyed and spread in the system while nutrients are lost after 
treatment. Reconceptualization out of the traditional centralized sanitation system design 
becomes a necessity facing global water scarcity, energy deficiency and poor sanitary conditions 
in some less developed/rural areas. The decentralized sanitation, al so considered as new 
sanitation or sustainable sanitation, coping with the current challenges, is designed as a resource -
recovery and reuse based wastewater treatment system. The profits come from recovering and 
reuse the water sources in greywater, and th e nutrients and bioenergy in blackwater. In such a 
design, the energy circle can be closed at a small scale through utilizing the bioenergy recovered 
from blackwater anaerobic treatment. Promising as the process is, only a few studies have been 
carried out  for blackwater anaerobic treatment. The process limitations, optimal treatment 
conditions, reaction mechanisms, and process optimization strategies, etc. have not been well 
comprehend ed and remain limitedly investigated.  
 
Aiming at enhancing bioenergy re covery from domestic wastewater and closing the energy 
supply loop at the household level, this research systematically studied the blackwater anaerobic 
treatment processes from the perspectives of i) identifying the treatment/process limitations and 
ii) m itigating limitations and optimizing the treatment processes. As a start, blackwater 
characterization was conducted for different blackwater sources collected from various types of 
toilet flushing systems - water -wasting and water -conserving toilets, and th e inhibitor 
identification studies were conducted using the bench -scale batch reactors. Chemical and 
biological properties of blackwater collected from conventional, dual flush and vacuum toilets 
were evaluated and the free ammonia inhibition was methodica lly studied. Then, continuous 
UASB treatments of conventional and vacuum toilet blackwater were conducted. High -rate 
treatments were pursued, and process limitations were evaluated. Sulfate inhibition in the 
methanogenesis process was identified in convent ional toilet blackwater treatment processes. 
Solid fraction organic hydrolysis was realized to have limited the maximum treatment capacity  212 in the vacuum toilet blackwater treatment processes. Then the food waste and vacuum toilet 
blackwater co -digestion we re performed to mitigate the hydrolysis limitation and to enhance the 
methane production. The involved biodegradation mechanisms were elucidated by the microbial 
communities’ development and their dynamic shifts throughout the whole research.  
 
9.2 Conclusions  
The results obtained from the current research demonstrated that anaerobic digestion is an 
effective way of extracting bioenergy from source -diverted blackwater. With the mitigations 
against the process limitations, the high -rate blackwater tre atment strategy with high organic 
removal efficiency and methane generation was demonstrated. The major conclusions are 
summarized as the following:  
 
Blackwater characteristics, treatment limitations , and process optimizations  
• The i nformation on blackwater  chemical and biological properties were  obtained from 
studies described in Chapter 3. The organic and nutrients concentrations showed higher values in 
the vacuum toilet blackwater  compared with the dual flush and conventional toilet blackwater. 
The high f ree ammonia (393 mg/L, 35 °C) concentration in vacuum toilet blackwater was found 
to inhibit the methanogenesis process, which resulted in a lower BMP value of 0.34 g CH 4-
COD/g feed COD compared with the other water -wasting type s of blackwater (BMP 0.48 g CH 4-
COD/g feed COD) with less free ammonia contents (26  and 60 mg/L). The stepwise mechanism 
study revealed that the anaerobic digestion processes for substrates’ hydrolysis and fermentation 
were not inhibited by the high free ammonia concentration. The f ree ammonia inhibitory level 
was identified as > 205 mg/L to impact the methane production in blackwater anaerobic 
treatment.  
• The performances of continuous UASB treating conventional toilet blackwater at 35 °C 
were described in Chapters 4 and 6. Different  OLRs and HRTs were tested in the study described 
in Chapter 6 with ranges of 0.18 -0.76 kg COD/m 3/day and 1.4 -5.5 days, respectively. The COD 
removal efficiencies were 72% and the methanisation rates were 23 -29% of the feed COD  in this 
demonstration. Compared with the BMP value obtained from the batch tests (Chapter 3), the 
continuous operation generated a lower methane yield. The treatment limitation was evaluated 
and verified in Chapter 4. Results showed that the sulfate conte nts of ~80 mg/L with the influent  213 COD/sulfate ratio of 12.2 in the conventional toilet blackwater inhibited the methanogenesis 
process and resulted in the lower methane production yield. The sulfate inhibition resulted in the 
microbial community shift and the inhibited methanogenesis activity. The toilet flushing water -
tap water was found to have contributed to the major source of the blackwater sulfate. A 30% 
higher methanisation rate was observed when the major sulfate content was removed from 
blackwater (through replacing tap water with DI water flush).  
• The performances of continuous UASB treating vacuum toilet blackwater at 35 °C were 
described in Chapters 5 and 6. Increasing  OLR s from 0.28 to 4.87 kg COD/m 3/day were applied 
to elucidate the maximum fea sible OLR. Results showed that the highest methane production 
rate of 0.68 m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor/day  was achieved under the OLR of 4.07 kg COD/m 3/day 
condition, and the total COD  removal efficiency could reach  84% with the methanisation rate 
reached 44% of th e feed COD. The feedstock pH control and the stepwise increasing OLR 
strategies helped mitigated the free ammonia inhibition identified from the batch test, and they 
contributed to the development of the effective high -rate vacuum toilet blackwater treatment 
process. The methane generation was found limited by the insufficient solid substrate hydrolysis 
under the overloaded condition at OLR of 4.87 kg COD/m 3/day. Over 40% reduction in the solid 
organics’ hydrolysis effic iency was observed.  
•  The performances of anaerobic co -digestion of vacuum toilet blackwater and food waste 
using a continuous UASB reactor at 35 °C were described in Chapters 7 and 8. The addition of 
food waste into blackwater successfully mitigated the l imitation of substrate hydrolysis identified 
in vacuum toilet blackwater mono -digestion study and enhanced the biomethane recovery 
efficacy from domestic wastewater. The OLR was increased by stepwise increasing the food 
waste additions in the co -substrates  with the blackwater: food waste VS mixing ratio changed 
from 1:0.3 to 1:1.5. The maximum feasible OLR was demonstrated to be 10 kg COD/m 3/day, 
which was 2.5 times of the maximum value obtained from blackwater mono -digestion system;  
the highest methane pro duction rate of 2.42 m3 CH 4/ m 3 reactor/day  was 3.6 times of the value 
obtained for treating only blackwater; the COD removal efficiency remained at a similar level of 
84% in the high -rate co -digestion system as compared with blackwater mono -digestion syst em. 
The optimal treatment performances achieved in the food waste and blackwater co -digestion 
system were attributed to the enhanced substrates properties including the more balanced C/N 
ratios, lower free ammonia concentrations, more readily hydrolyzed or ganics, and the enhanced  214 microorganisms with higher activities, which facilitated both substrate hydrolysis and 
methanogenesis.   
 
Methanogenic pathway and microbial  community  development  
Methods of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, carbon isotopic analysis, and specific 
methanogenic activity tests have been utilized to reveal the development of microbial community 
structures and the establishment of the methanogenic pathway in the blackwater treatment 
processes in this research. The combine d syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) and 
hydrogenotrophic methanogenic (HM) pathway played a key role in obtaining effective 
biomethane production from blackwater treatment. Both the feedstock properties and the applied 
operational conditions affected the microbial community structure and microbial activities.  
   
• The results described in Chapter 3 i n the batch reactors  showed that  bacteria from 
Bacteroidales and the SAO bacterial group Clostridiales domina ted in both vacuum and 
conventional toilet blackwate r. Mixotrophic methanogens  from Methanosarcina  dominated the 
archaeal communities in both blackwater reactors. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens from  
Methanoculleus  and Methanomicrobiales  showed high abundances in vacuum toilet blackwater 
reactors while different groups of methanogens from Methanobacterium  and Methanolinea  were 
found abundant in conventional toilet blackwater condition. Such microbial structures indicated 
that a combined S AO and HM pathway might be established in both blackwater treatment groups 
for methane production. The microbial diversities in both bacterial and archaeal communities 
were observed less in vacuum toilet blackwater conditions, which can be attributed to the higher 
free ammonia concentration  compared with the conventional toilet blackwater .   
• From the results described in Chapters 4 and 6, the archaeal community was dominated 
by hydrogenotrophic methanogens from Methanospirillum  and Methanolinea  in the conti nuous 
treatment of conventional toilet blackwater in the UASB reactor. Methanolinea  was dominan t 
under all applied OLRs conditions. Different from the batch reactors, sulfate reducing bacteria 
(SRB) were enriched in the continuous operation system. The dominant SRB communities from 
Desulfobulbaceae  and Desulfomicrobiaceae  can consume H 2 for sulfate r eduction, which 
resulted in competitions for electron donors between SRB and methanogens. The predominant 
methanogenic group shifted from Methanolinea  to Methanospirillum  when eliminating most  215 sulfate contents in the blackwater, and higher specific methano genic activities of the biomass 
were achieved.  The bacterial consortia from Clostridiales  were enriched, which is capable of 
generating H 2 and functional for syntrophic acetate oxidation . 
• Results from Chapters 5, 6 and 8 described the microbial community d evelopment in 
vacuum toilet blackwater UASB treatment system. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated 
the system, with the methanogens from genus Methanogenium  being predominant after the 
applied OLR exceeded 0.28 kg COD/m 3/day. It was noticed that the hydrolytic -fermentative 
bacteria group from genus Bacteroides  generated increasing relative abundances with the 
increasing OLR applied and showed a considerably high value of 28.3% under the highest OLR 
condition of 4.07 kg COD/m 3/day. Bacteria from order Clostridiales  also dominated the system 
throughout the operation. The functional genes prediction revealed that the prevalence of SAO 
functional genes in the vacuum toilet blackwater treatment system was contributed from the 
enrichm ent of an unidentified family in order Clostridiales . The isotopic carbon analysis for the 
produced biogas verified that the SAO -HM pathway was developed in the vacuum toilet 
blackwater treatment system.  
• From the results of beta -diversity i n both conventi onal and vacuum toilet blackwater 
continuous UASB treatment  in Chapter 6 , it was observed that the bacterial communities can 
quickly adapt to the feedstock -blackwater and remain relatively stable with the changing OLRs, 
while archaeal communities shifted s lowly when adapting to different OLRs. Similar to results  
obtained from  the batch test , the microbial community diversity was lower in the vacuum toilet 
blackwater UASB. The isotopic carbon fractionation factor 𝛼𝑐 showed a higher value of 1.047 
for the vacuum blackwater system than 1.038 obtained from the conventional blackwater system. 
These differences in the microbial community development between conventional and vacuum 
type blackwater  were mostly attributed to the high ammonium concentration in the vacuum 
blackwater treatment system.      
• The r esults from Chapter 8 described the micro bial community development in the food 
waste and vacuum toilet blackwater co -digestion system in the UASB reactor. Multiple groups of  
bacteria consortia that are capable of performing syntrophic VFAs oxidation were enriched. The 
predominant bacterial group  shifted from genus Bacteroides in blackwater mono -digestion 
system  to genus T78 in the co -digestion system. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated the 
system. The predominant methanogens shifted from genus Methanogenium to genus  216 Methanoculleus  and uncultu red genus from family Methanospirillaceae  from mono - to co -
digestion treatment . Methanospirillaceae  showed its highest relative abundance at OLR 7.0 kg 
COD/m 3/day condition , while Methanoculleus generated the highest abundance under the 
organic overloaded condition at OLR 11.6 kg COD/m 3/day. The simultaneous  dynamic shifts of 
SAO bacterial groups Clostridiales  and T78 with methanogenic group Methanospirillaceae 
indicated their probabl e synergistic  correlation s. Their reduction under the overloaded condition 
indicated the impairment of the SAO -HM capacity. Isotopic fractionation factors (1.047 - 1.056) 
throughout the co -digestion operation illustrate d the dominance of the SAO -HM pathway in the 
co-digestion system.  
 
9.3 Outlook  
Compared with the conventional centralized sanitation, the new sanitation system is more 
competitive towards the growing urbanization, especially is favorable for remote or developing 
areas  that are lack of wastewater treatment infrastructures. The sustainability of the new 
sanitation system is contributed by the biomethane recovery from blackwater and kitchen waste, 
heat recovery from greywater, nutrients recovery and water reuse. The recovered biome thane, as 
demonstrated in the current work, can be directly utilized as a heating source or as electricity 
through the combined heat and power (CHP) system. The effluent, however, usually requires 
further treatment before being distributed or reused due to  the presence of nutrients, pathogens, 
micropollutants and residual organic matters.  
 
In addition to apply the liquid -phase anaerobic digestion effluent to crops, nutrients can be 
recovered in solid form in the  post-treatment  process  after anaerobic diges tion. Struvite 
precipitation has been considered as a popular process for recovering the nitrogen and 
phosphorus resources, and the recovered struvite can be utilized as a type of slow -release 
agricultural fertilizer. However, this process needs to be cond ucted in a separate process from the 
anaerobic bioreactor, and it requires additional chemical costs for magnesium, which increased 
the capital and operational costs. The profits are also restrained by the fact that struvite 
application is limited in the p hosphorus industry due to the presence of magnesium and ammonia. 
Facing this situation, increasing research attention has been put on achieving the single -stage 
biogas and phosphorus recovery in anaerobic bioreactors, where the phosphorus can be  217 recovered in the form of calcium phosphate. In this process, biomass and calcium phosphate 
coprecipitated and formed granules in AD bioreactors (Tervahauta et al., 2014) . While with 
limited studies being conducted, the favorable operational conditions remained un clear to enable 
a well -controlled and stabilized precipitation protocol for efficient phosphorous recovery. The 
risks and feasibility of the downstream utilization of such granules have not yet been investigated. 
Further studies are recommended to help est ablish a better phosphorous recovery process. The 
nitrogen concentration in AD effluent is high, even after struvite precipitation. The partial 
nitritation -anammox processes can be implemented as a post -treatment process for nitrogen 
removal (Pedrouso et al., 2020; Vlaeminck et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2020) . 
 
Feces and urine contain pathogens and micropollutants (p harmaceuticals, hormones, bacteria 
containing antibiotic resi stant genes), which are the major concerns for the recycle and reuse of 
the treated wastewater. It has been reported that the anaerobic digestion and the following 
nitrogen removal processes can partially degrade micropollutants, but the complete removal 
cannot be achieved (Gros et al., 2020) . Chemo -physical processes such as electrochemical 
oxidation can be implemented for effective micropollutants’ remov al from the effluent 
(Radjenovic et al., 2011) , and composting can be applied to the UASB sludge to remove 
micropollutants in the solid phase (Butkovskyi et al., 2016) . Disinfection is indispensable before 
effluent utilization. The fates of the micropollutants in the end -products should be monitored for 
better  risk assessment. Further investigations are required for establishing effective 
micropollutants’ removal modules in the new sanitation system. The effluent residual COD can 
be removed through implementing an aerobic polishing system such as aerobic ponds.  Otherwise, 
the effluent can be simply stored in a storage tank for a certain period time to meet the discharge 
standard.  
 
The current work contributed to the knowledge of microbial community development and 
functional pathways in blackwater treatment at the DNA level, yet questions remain in 
transferring the information into engineering practice to guide the design and operat ions of the 
full-scale bioreactors. To promote applications such as bioaugmentation with functional 
microorganisms or enzymes to facilitate biogas production and pollutants removal , the RNA -
level and proteomic analysis  can be performed to further  identify the core microorganisms. In  218 addition, t he current work has realized that the syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) played a key 
role for biomethane generation in blackwater treatment process,  but investigation s on syntrophic 
oxidation remain inadequate: SAO s pecies have not been well recognized or isolated so far, and 
the triggering parameters /conditions  of the SAO pathway remain insufficiently addressed. 
Operational conditions such as temperature , VFA and ammonia concentration s have been 
correlated with SAO  (Karakashev et al., 2006) , but these factors may not necessarily be essential, 
taking into account th at SAO has been  observ ed in the conventional toilet flushed blackwater 
treatment system  in the current study . Roles of inoculum, substrate type, reactor design, sludge  
retention time, operation duration  could possibly contribute to SAO. Identifications of the 
influential factors can be promoted by  manipulating operational  factor s and analyzing 
corresponding SAO genes expression , and more data collection and comparisons between other 
reported  studies can facilitate th is work. It should be noted that t he role of SAO needs further 
elucidation as it appears to be robust against challenging conditions but is rate -limiting.   
 
The anaerobic digestion model No.1 (ADM1) model ha s been developed for blackwater and 
kitchen waste treatment in a CSTR system (Feng et al.,  2006) , but it has never been tested for 
other bioreactor configurations (e.g. UASB in the current study). The ADM1 model in the UASB 
reactor can be developed based on the lab -scale data. Notably, the microbial interactions and the 
functional pathway ar e valuable information to be considered in the model. Their  application s 
can better simulate the process and reveal the limitations in the blackwater (and kitchen waste) 
digestion processes, which could assist practical operations in full -scale demonstrations.   
 
In the new sanitation system, vacuum transportation has played a key role in facilitating water 
conservation and high bioenergy recovery. Electricity is required to provide the air pressure 
under the low water conditions yet more benefits  can be obtained from the less water resource 
consumption, the more concentrated blackwater flow (representing higher energy value) and the 
less effluent volume (for easier transportation and handling) in the vacuum system. Up to date, 
most of the establis hed demonstrations utilized vacuum toilets with 1 L water per flush, while 
lower water demands such as 0.5 L/flush and even 0.25 L/flush could help further save 
freshwater and generate lower waste flow. Vacuum toilets with 0.5 L/flush are currently 
availab le in the market (e.g. Fann Roslagen Vacuum Toilet ) but have not been well demonstrated  219 in blackwater treatment studies. It should be noted that with less water consumed, the ammonium 
concentration would rise, which may result in free ammonia inhibition in  AD bioreactors. In this 
case, it is important to perform the kitchen waste co -digestion to mitigate the C/N ratio and pH. 
The pH values in the bioreactor should be monitored and well -controlled when necessary.  
 
A major reason that has limited the worldwi de popularization of the new sanitation system was 
the fact that the conventional sanitation systems have cost (continuously) large investments and 
remain reliable, and to replace them with new sanitation systems requires new investments. 
Further, public a cceptance may be restrained by the concerns about micropollutants and 
pathogens in the end -products. It requires the cooperation of all stakeholders including the 
public, governments, water boards . to fulfill their duties to mitigate these restraints. Publ ic 
education can help elucidate the advantages and risks of establishing new sanitation for the 
general public. End -product users, for instance, the agricultural actors that utilize the recovered 
nutrients and reclaimed water could be actively involved in illustrating the benefits and risks.  In 
the transition of conventional to new sanitation, the government should play an essential role in 
policy and decision making and the integration of all stakeholders.  New towns and communities, 
and remote areas that l ack central sanitation system s can be encouraged to pionee r new sanitation 
demonstrations.  
 
Overall, sustainable sanitation  can be realized through closing energy, water and nutrients loop s 
in the decentralized sanitation system. Despite the demonstrated feasibility and advantages, the 
global applications of the decentralized sanitation system remain low up to date. More 
investigations and  modifications  are needed to resolve constraints and  further  enhance the 
process’s sustainability.
