Abstract
The axial ligand of the catalytic mononuclear T1 copper site (Met502) of the CotA laccase was replaced by a
leucine or phenylalanine residue to increase the redox potential of the enzyme. These mutations led to an
increase in the redox potential by approx. 100 mV relative to the wild-type enzyme but the catalytic-centreactivity k
catin the mutant enzymes was severely compromised. This decrease in the catalytic efﬁciency
was unexpected as the X-ray analysis of mutants has shown that replacement of methionine ligand did
not lead to major structural changes in the geometry of the T1 centre or in the overall fold of the enzyme.However, the mutations have a profound impact on the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme. The fold
of the enzyme has become unstable especially with the introduction of the larger phenylalanine residue
and this instability should be related to the decrease in the catalytic efﬁciency. The instability of the foldfor the mutant proteins resulted in the accumulation of an intermediate state, partly unfolded, in-between
native and unfolded states. Quenching of tryptophan ﬂuorescence by acrylamide has further revealed that
the intermediate state is partly unfolded.
Introduction
Laccases are members of the multicopper oxidase family of
enzymes that includes ascorbate oxidase and ceruloplasmin
[1,2]. These are potential biocatalysts for biotechnological
applications [3,4], mainly owing to their high relative non-
specific oxidation capacity, lack of a requirement for cofactors
and the use of readily available oxygen as an electronacceptor. The initial substrate reaction products are dioxygen-
centred radicals or cation radicals, which usually react further
through non-enzymatic routes for the oxidative coupling of
monomers or the degradation of polymers. Recently, we
undertook a multidisciplinary study of the CotA laccase
from Bacillus subtilis as a model bacterial laccase system.
CotA laccase is a thermoactive and intrinsically thermostable
enzyme [5]. The X-ray structure have shown that the
enzyme has a typical three-domain laccase fold [6] with aT1 mononuclear copper centre in domain 3 and a trinuclear
copper cluster (two T3 and one T2 copper ions) located
between domains 1 and 3. T1 mononuclear copper site is
the primary acceptor site for electrons derived from the
reducing substrate. The trinuclear cluster acts in dioxygenbinding and reduces the molecular oxygen to water upon
receipt of four electrons forwarded from the mononuclear
centre T1 [2,7,8]. The conserved co-ordinating amino acids

residue, and the natural variations occur in the so-called axial
position, most commonly a methionine. Fungal laccases have
a non-co-ordinating phenylalanine or leucine residue at the
axial position and these may contribute, at least in part, to
the high redox potential observed in these enzymes. To testthis hypothesis, we have performed site-directed mutagenesis
of the methionine residue in the axial position of the T1 cop-
per site of CotA (position 502) to leucine and phenylalanine
residues and then analysed the effect of these mutations on
the kinetics, redox potential and stability of the enzyme [9].
Catalytic and redox properties of wild-type
and mutant proteins
The site-directed replacement of Met502, an axial ligand
of the T1 copper site, by the non-co-ordinating residue
leucine and phenylalanine resulted in enzymes with the
characteristic fold of the wild-type protein [9]. Overall,
the geometry of the T1 copper centre is maintained in the
mutant proteins displaying only small changes. The Cδ2
Leu502atom is located further way from the T1 copper and
no longer co-ordinates with it, as observed in other laccases
that have a leucine residue at that position. In the M502F
mutant the phenylalanine residue is positioned further away
from the copper atom and does not co-ordinate with it.
The slight movement of the mutated residue towards theprotein surface, and away from the T1 copper atom, leads
to a concerted movement of this region, pushing it away
towards the solvent and slightly increasing the exposure

of the copper centre. Copper content was determined by
the trichloroacetic acid/bicinchoninic acid method [10] andconfirmed by atomic absorption and revealed a stoichiometry
close to 4 Cu per protein for both mutants. The wild-type
enzyme previously produced with a stoichiometry of 2 Cuper protein [9] was now produced full loaded using a new
production strategy (unpublished work) and therefore all the
Q1
results presented in this paper were obtained with full loaded
enzymes, with the obvious exception of apo-CotA.
Both mutations were successful regarding the increase in
redox potential as described by Dur ˜ao et al. [9] (Table 1). The
replacement of the axial methionine residue by a leucine and
a phenylalanine in the CotA laccase leads to an increase inthe redox potential by approx. 100 and 60 mV respectively. It
was not expected that the mutations would have major effects
on the substrate-binding site, and indeed no major alter-
ations regarding the K
mvalue for SGZ (syringaldazine;
Table 1) and other substrates were observed [9]. Significant
changes were found, however, for both mutants, in the values
of kcat. The M502L exhibits a 2.5-fold decrease and M502F
a 1840-fold decrease in kcat. Clearly, no direct correlation
was found between the redox potentials and the oxidationrates of the substrate. Both mutants exhibited higher redox
potentials than the wild-type and lower turnover rates. The
parameter k
catsets the lower limit to the first-order rate
constant in the enzymatic reaction (reflects the rate-limiting
step). For an electron-transfer reaction, its rate is mainly
determined by the donor–acceptor electronic coupling,
where the exact geometry of the protein matrix has an
important role, the redox potential and the reorganizationenergy, which also depends on the structure and dynamics
of the protein [11]. In the present case, we can hypothesize
that mutations could have affected the electronic tunnelling
and/or the reorganization energy of the electron-transfer
processes to find possible reasons for discrepancies between
k
catvalues and redox potentials.
Thermodynamic stability of wild-type and
mutant proteins
The thermodynamic stability of CotA was assessed by
fluorescence to evaluate the effect of copper and mutations
on the overall stability of the tertiary structure (Figure 1).
CotA has nine tryptophan residues (excited selectively at
296 nm) with percentages of exposure to water between 0
and 8% compared with a tryptophan residue in a standardGly-Trp-Gly extended peptide [12]. This buried location is
in accordance with the emission maximum of 331–333 nm
observed for the native state of the three proteins presented
in Figure 1. A maximum of 330–332 nm was assigned to
tryptophan residues buried in non-polar regions of proteins
[13]. Upon unfolding, the wavelengths at the emission
maxima shifted to the red, reflecting clearly the exposure
of tryptophan residues to the high polarity of water at the
surface of the protein. The CotA structure is very stable,
displaying a GdmCl (guanidinium chloride) concentration
of 4.6 M at the midpoint (where 50% of the molecules

unfolded state by 10 kcal/mol (1 cal ≈4.184 J; Table 1).
The apo-CotA is less stable at room temperature but as the
transition is less co-operative ( mvalue is lower) leading to a
midpoint slightly larger. The T1 copper, at least, is bleached atlower GdmCl concentrations compared with the unfolding
of tertiary structure [9] and therefore no strong stabilization
by copper was expected for CotA wild-type. The unfolding
process for the wild-type and apoprotein (Figures 1A and
1B) was accurately described according to a two-state process
with native (N) and unfolded (U) states being the only ones
that accumulate significantly (N ↔U). The mutations M502L
and M502F have a profound impact on the stability of CotA.
Only the stability of M502L is shown in Figure 1(C) but the
mutant M502F shows basically the same pattern (Table 1).
First, the unfolding of the tertiary structure is clearly a non-Figure 2 Acrylamide quenching of tryptophan ﬂuorescence of

the accurate fit of the unfolding process. The native state

residues are partially exposed to water in the I state as shown
by the wavelength of the emission maximum, indicating
that the I state is a partially unfolded state. The conversion
from I into the unfolded state occurs only at high GdmCl
concentrations and is thermodynamically more similar to theconversion of N into U in the wild-type and apoprotein.

quenching is dynamic, as it seems to be indicated by the linear
Stern–Volmer plot, the KSVconstant reflects the accessibility
of tryptophan residues to collisions with acrylamide [15].
A linear Stern–Volmer plot is generally also indicative of
a single class of tryptophan residues, all equally accessible
to acrylamide. Indeed all tryptophan residues in CotA are
similarly buried as stated above. The KSVconstants of the
analogue of a tryptophan residue totally exposed to water[NATA ( N-acetyltryptophanamide)] is much larger (approx.

−1[16]) than the values reported for CotA (Figure 2).
To our knowledge, KSVvalues for proteins, even denatured
proteins, never reach the values observed for NATA, which
indicates that the polypeptide chain always impose some
stereochemical limitations. A fully exposed residue in the
polypeptide corticotropin has a KSVvalue of 13.5 M−1[17].
The KSVvalues reported for the wild-type and mutant
M502L are small, reflecting the buried position of tryptophan
residues. The value for apo-CotA increases slightly relatively
to the holoprotein pointing to a small degree of structure
that might be inducible by copper binding. The most
distinctive feature of acrylamide quenching is clearly
the identification of the intermediate ‘I’ revealed duringguanidinium denaturation experiments. In the presence
of 2 M of GdmCl where the intermediate I accumulates
significantly for the mutant protein only, the K
SVvalue
increases 4.3-fold compared with 1.1- and 1.5-fold increases
for the apoprotein and wild-type protein. Quenching by
acrylamide indicates that the intermediate state I is partially
unfolded, exposing tryptophan residues to collisions with
acrylamide in accordance with the red-shift observed for thewavelengths at the emission maximum in Figure 1.
Concluding remarks
The replacement of the weak so-called axial ligand of the T1site of bacterial CotA laccase leads to an increase in theredox potential relative to that of the wild-type enzyme as
expected based on fungal laccases. The role of the T1 site
within the multicopper oxidases is related to the long-rangeintramolecular electron transfer, shuttling the electrons from
the reduced substrate to the trinuclear centre, where O
2is
reduced to water. X-ray structural comparison of M502Land M502F mutants with the wild-type CotA shows that the
geometry of the T1 copper site is maintained as well as
the overall fold of the proteins. However, the M502L mutantexhibits a 2.5-fold decrease in k
catvalue for the substrate
SGZ and the catalytic-centre activity in M502F is even more
severely compromised with a 1840-fold decrease. Therefore
no direct correlation was found between the redox potential
and the oxidation rates. The thermodynamic stability of themutant proteins and wild-type CotA has shown why such a
correlation was not found. The mutations in the axial ligandhave a profound impact on the thermodynamic stability of
the enzyme. While the unfolding of the tertiary structurein the wild-type enzyme is a two-state process displaying
a midpoint at a GdmCl concentration of 4.6 M and a free
energy exchange in water of 10 kcal/mol, the unfolding for
both mutant enzymes is clearly not a two-state process.
At 1.6 or 1.9 M GdmCl, depending on the mutant, half of
the molecules are in an intermediate conformation, only1.4 kcal/mol less stable than the native state. This intermediate
state is a partly unfolded state with tryptophan residues
partly exposed at the surface of the protein as revealed by
collisional quenching of fluorescence by acrylamide. The in-
stability introduced by leucine and phenylalanine in the foldof the CotA enzyme that led to the accumulation of the
intermediate state at very low guanidinium concentrations
has probably slightly changed the exact geometry of theprotein matrix and the dynamics of the protein, affecting
thus the rate of the electron-transfer reaction.
