Abstract - In this work Azo dye {(2,2'-(3,3'-dimethylbiphenyl-4,4'-diyl) bis (1-(2- hydrazinyl -3,5-dinitrophenyl)diazene)} have been 
prepared and characterized by, spectorphotometric method UV -Vis,  FT -IR spectrum and 1H-NMR spectrum. The absorption maxima 
was observed in the 464 nm, Thermogravime tric(TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of this compound was measured, 
The photostability of azo dye in water occurred under UV irradiation processes. Dyeing process has on the dye prepared it gave good 
results. we have found that the colors o f cotton fabrics after dyeing was orange

NTRODUCTION  
ynthetic dyes are broadly used in paper printing, fabric dyeing , food , medicines, color photography, cosmetics and other manufacture
 (1). 
        Azo dyes are one of the very consequential and multilateral classify artifical organic compounds,with an immense variety of 
using (2,3). Azo dyes which calcalate for 60 – 80% of the dyes consumed in fabric tretment (4,5) are 
between one to three, 
linking naphthyl rings or phenyl that are Usually substituted with some of functional groups for instance sulphonate, triazine amino, 
nitro,  methyl, hydroxyl and chloro (6). 
        Thermal analysis plays an major role in the study of the stability and struct ure of dyes. The application of some dyes for specific 
uses and detect 
 used in 
high temperature processes such as dyeing, printing and photocopying and in high technology areas for instance lasers and ele ctro 
optical devices(8).

P. 
      Light fastness is an important factor in the determination of the useful life span of textiles. Light may produce two differe nt 
changes in dyed 
  
 
        Many factors effect the photostability of dyes , and these principally contain the chemical structure of the dye, The dye physical 
state on the fibre, the substrate chemical structure of, additives within the substrate, composition of atmospheric (water,ox ygen and 
contaminants), temperature of the ambient and the spectral distribution of the in cident light. P(15) 
        We report here  the synthesis, photostability , thermostabilities and application of new azo dye on cotton fabrics.

Photostability experimental procedures  
        Samples of dye solution was irradiated with a UV source for 10,20, 30, 40, 50 ,60, 70, 80 ,90 and 100 min , in this experimen ts 
that  were 
 placed into the 
reaction container.  At 10 min intervals, about 2 mL dye 
proportion of azo dye was 
calculated by the following formula:  
(Decoloration (%) = ( A0-A)/A0×100% )  
where  A and A0 are the residual and initial absprption of  dye solution each in order.  
 
Dyeing experimental procedures  
        In this research we have been dyeing cotton tissue by dye prepared, according to dyeing azo dye way (Azotic Dyes) which calle d 
dyeing snow and are in accordance with the following steps:  
1- Prepare raw cotton tissue through the removal of starch , go od boiling and bleaching.  
2- Dissolve the dye: dye prepared dissolved in 10 ml of ethanol and 0.2 ml of sodium hydroxide and then complete the volume 
to 150 ml with distilled water at pH equal to 10.  
3- Gmarat raw cotton in the soda for 30 minutes in a water bat h containing 0.0004M sodium nitrite solution and 0.9 ml of HCl 
acid and 150 ml of distilled water in 15-20 ° C. Then raw dried degree normal temperature  
4- put the cotton tissue in the bathroom of the display, which contains 0.1 g of dye and 1 ml of sodium hy droxide concentration 
of 0.32 M and continue treatment for 30 minutes in temperature 10- 15. Oevdil use of ice as it is obtained is usually the best 
results at low temperatures .  
5- Washed raw in a soap bath and sodium carbonate to remove the dyeing materials  outstanding Bavh for true color And 
thereby improve the stability force against the light, washing and friction, then removed the soap solution by rinsing proces s, 
a washing with cold water and dried

        The new prepared dye kn own to be one of thermal and photo stable materials(18) .  
         The chemical structure of the dye 2,2'-(3,3'-dimethylbiphenyl -4,4'-diyl)bis(1-(2-hydrazinyl -3,5-dinitrophenyl) diazene was 
determine by FT -IR, 1HNMR, and UV -Vis spectra. UV-Vis absorption spectra of dye solution was registered  in methanol, the 
absorption maxima( λ max) of dye was found in 464 nm fig. 2 .  
         FT-IR fig. (3) which showed appearance bands at (1598-1543) cm-1 of stretching vibration of two (N=N)  groups. Stretching 
vibration of (C -H) of alkyl group in o - tolidine appear at (2904)cm-1, the appearance band at (3417 -3277) cm-1 stretching vibration of 
two hydrazone -NH groups, the band at (1234) cm-1 stretching vibration of (N -N) groups.  
        The 1H-NMR spectra signals at 2.8  ppm due to the existence of methyl groups in o - tolidine in the compound, signals (7.2-7.8) 
ppm due to aromatic protons of new compound  , 8.5 ppm (hydrazone NH).These signals depict more characteristic prove for the 
formation of this compound fig(4).  
       Direct irradiated under ultraviolet (UV) light alone of dye solution  shown in Fig. 5. The efficiency of degradation of dye solution 
was calculated to be 5.771% at 100 minuts by using 1×10-4M concentration of dye solution .   
        These results show that much better stable for the dy e under UV 
difference times increases with 
time, especially after 100 min,indicating that the photostability of dye is usually accepted (15) that the 
auxochromes which mean

        Thermal stability that w as measured and represented in Figure 6. It shows that the dye started decomposing at 290°C and its 
weight losing was 68.27% up to the temperature studied (600°C) ,  and this showed that the sample dye has thermal stability up to 290C◦. And photooxidation process shown photostability for dye.

www.ijsrp.org           From Figure.6  it is shown that the weight losses observed between 50 -150 C◦ , 150-290 C◦ and 290-600 C◦. The temperature 
vary within 
 in Figure 6, the 
weight change  were 7.187%, 68.27% and 23.53% at a heating rate 10°C/min.           
         The DSC curve of dye gives two endothermic peaks at 75 C◦which mention to dehydrate of water and at 230 C◦ this 
endothermic peak corresponding to melting of compound at 230 C◦,  the DSC curve shows exo thermic peak at 600 C◦. This 
information propose that the thermal stability of the dye .  
consequently, the TG and DSC studies on dye showed that they can 
 
 
     
 
         Dyeing process has on the dye prepared dyeing process has in the acidic environmen t and has adopted a method of the snow 
dyeing, which is concerned with azo dyes only Because being prepared at low temperatures insatiable seersucker alkaline solut ion has 
been subjecting the samples dyed with dyes prepared a series of tests that usually take place after the pigments applied to cotton 
fabrics for the purpose of evaluation. The most important of these tests, the extent of resistance to sunlight and laundry de tergents and 
color stability (20). As it gave good results. we have found that the c olors of cotton fabrics after dyeing was orange.  
 
II. CONCLUSIONS  
        The azo dye was synthesized by diazotisation - coupling and oxidation reactions in good yield shows greatly better photostability 
beneath UV irradiation and thermostability,   it λmax was observed at 464 nm .The decomposition temperatures of dye was found to 
be in the range 290 –600 C◦ . The dye was better stable when the dye under UV irradiation, 
photo and thermal stability . 
Dyeing process has on the dye prepared it gave good results. w e have found that the colors of cotton fabrics after dyeing was orange
