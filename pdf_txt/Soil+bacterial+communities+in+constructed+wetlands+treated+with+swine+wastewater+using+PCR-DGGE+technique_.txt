 2 Abstract  30 
 31 
The prokaryotic microbial communities  (Bacteria and Archaea)  of three different systems  32 
operat ing in Denmark for the treatment of domestic wastewater (horizontal flow constructed 33 
wetlands (HFCW), vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCW) and biofilters (BF)) was 34 
analy sed using endpoint PCR followed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE ). 35 
Further  sequencing of the most representative bacterial bands  revealed that diverse and 36 
distinct bacterial communities were found in each system unit, being  γ-Proteobacteria and 37 
Bacteroidetes present  mainly  in all of them , while Firmicutes was obse rved in HFCW and BF. 38 
Members of the Actinobacteria group, although found in HFCW and VFCW, seemed to be 39 
more abundant in BF units . Finally, some representatives of α , ß and δ -Proteobacteria, 40 
Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi were also retrieved from  some samples. On the other hand, a 41 
lower archaeal diversity was found in comparison with the bacterial population. Cluster 42 
analysis of the DGGE bacterial band patterns showed that community  structure was related to 43 
the design of the treatment system  and t he organic matter load, while n o clear relation was 44 
established between the microbial assemblage  and the wastewater influent.  45

 3 1. Introduction  50 
 51 
Natural wastewater treatment systems such as constructed wetlands, biological sand filters 52 
and other decentralised solutions are becoming an increasingly relevant alternative to 53 
conventional systems when treating wastewater from small communities  and dwellings  due to 54 
its efficiency, low establishment costs and low operation and management requirements.  In 55 
order to treat wastewater  effectively , several factors have to be taken into account, e.g. the 56 
system’s capacity, the  plant species  used, colonization characteris tics of certain microbial 57 
groups, and  the interactions of biogenic compounds and particular contaminants (wastewater 58 
components) with the filter bed material (Stottmeister, 2003). Although filtration is 59 
considered an important process in these removal mechanisms, additional interactions occur 60 
among media, plants and water.  Many processes and relations between  them  take place: 61 
microbial -mediated processes, chemical networks, volatilization, sedimentation, sorption, 62 
photodegradation, plant uptake, transpi ration flux and accretion (Kadlec and Wallace, 2009). 63 
The importance of microbial processes has been  further studied as many reactions are 64 
microbiologically mediated (Stottmeister 2003, Kadlec and Wallace, 2009). 65 
 66 
The most stable microbiota in these system s is found in the biofilm associated to the  plant’s 67 
roots and/or attached to the surface of the filter bed material. Th is complex microbial 68 
community created by interactions with wastewater, is mainly responsible for the degradation 69 
performance of the syst em (Sleytr et al ., 2009). Furthermore , the diversity of microorganisms 70 
in this environment may be critical for its proper functioning and maintenance (Ibekwe, 71 
2003). To improve the design of the se systems , a detailed knowledge of the structure of these 72 
communities should be acquired in order to understand the biological processes that are 73 
taking place  within the m (Truu et al., 2009, Dong and Reddy , 2010). Recently, s everal studies 74 
have characterized microbial populations in laboratory scale units , sand filters  and full scale 75 
constructed wetlands  under specific conditions (Ragusa et al., 2004, Vacca et al ., 2005, 76 
Baptista et al. , 2008, Calheiros et al., 2009, Krasnits et al., 2009, Sleytr et al ., 2009, Zhang  et 77 
al., 2010, Dong and Reddy , 2010). Howe ver, there is a general lack of information on the 78 
diversity and changes of the microbial communities in long -term operation systems treating 79 
domestic wastewater at real  time scale (Krastnits et al ., 2009).  80 
 81 
Increased removal efficiency of nitrogen from w astewater is one of the key issues for further 82 
development of constructed wetlands  and other decentralised technologies. The diversity of 83 
microorganisms involved in the N -cycle is expected to be high in these systems. In fact, 84 
previous studies have suggested that archaeal nitrifiers, denitrifying fungi, aerobic 85  
 4 denitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic nitrifying microorganisms may play an important role 86 
in nitrogen transformations in constructed wetlands (Truu et al ., 2005). Most importantly, the 87 
effects of biofilms  on nitrogen transformation and removal have not been adequately studied 88 
and model led. As microorganisms  affect processes like nitrification, denitrification, uptake, 89 
and sedimentation, they  have to be taken into conside ration when modelling  the 90 
transformation and removal of nitrogen from wastewater (Mayo and Bigambo, 2004). Thus, a  91 
first step for  establishing the role of biological communities in N -removal in constructed 92 
wetlands is to evaluate the diversity of microorga nisms under di fferent conditions and 93 
systems .  With  this purpose r ecent studies have introduced the characterization  of bacterial 94 
communities by means of molecular methods based on 16S rRNA gene analysis (Sleytr, 95 
2009). 96 
 97 
The aim of this study was to compare the composition of microbial communities of three 98 
different types of domestic wastewate r treatment systems  used in Denmark : Horizontal Flow 99 
Constructed Wetlands (HFCW), Vertical Flow Constructed Wetlands (VFCW) and Bio filters 100 
(BF, with combined configurations of vertical or horizontal flow) using the PCR -DGGE 101 
based method. The systems were composed of different  bed filling media , namely soil, sand 102 
and LWA  (lightweight  aggregate) . In this work , we enlarged  the microbial analysis by 103 
analyzing both the  bacterial and archaeal populations, focusing in the possible influence of the 104 
water influent composition, the design and the bed filling of the treatment systems in the 105 
structure  of these microbial communities . 106 
 107 
2. Material and methods  108 
 109 
2.1 Site description  110 
 111 
The wastewater treatment systems (WWTS) investigated were rural facilities used in 112 
Denmark for the treatment of domestic wastewater s. All the systems were built following 113 
Danish guidelines and comply with Danish  wastewater discharge standards  (for details see 114 
Brix and Arias, 2005) . The layout of all the studied systems include d a primary treatment 115 
step, using  a sedimentation tank with a hydraulic residence time proportional to the number of 116 
people served  and a minimum of 2  m3. The second treat ment step differs depending on the 117 
system chosen by the users among an array of technical possibilities approved by the Danish  118 
EPA .  119 
Three types of systems were selected for the study : two horizontal flow constructed wetlands 120 
(HFCW)  with soil beds , two vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCW)  with sand bed and 121  
 5 two  LWA  Biofilters (BF) fitted with a F iltralite -P® bed for the  removal of phosphorous 122 
(Jenssen et al., 2010). The systems differ ed in flow configuration, operational and bed media 123 
characteristic s.   124 
 125 
The HFCW s studied have been operational for over 20 years . The systems were built 126 
following national guidelines ( Miljøministeriet Miljøstyrelsen , 1990) and were composed of 127 
two soil filled beds operating in parallel with the necessary structures for distribution and 128 
collection of domestic water . After the treatment water was  discharged to  nearby  129 
watercourses ( for details see B rix et al., 2009) . 130 
 131 
VFCWs were also built following the Danish  design and construction guidelines 132 
(Miljøministeriet Miljøstyrelsen  2005). The d omestic wastewater was  pre-treated  in a 133 
sedimentation tank;  after that, water was loaded sequentially on the system surface at a rate of 134 
approx. 20 pulses/d to an unsaturated bed filled with sand , where it was homogeneously 135 
distributed in the surface trickl ing vertically. Once the water percolated through a one meter 136 
deep bed , it was collected at the bottom and evacuated. In order to improve  the water quality , 137 
and enhance denitrification capacity, treated water  was recycled back to the pumping well  in 138 
one of the two systems studied, where conditions should favour the process  (for details see 139 
Brix and Arias, 2005) . 140 
 141 
BFs are media filled systems that combine unsaturated conditions and a water saturated bed. 142 
The first section of the system operates unsaturated; it is housed in a fibreglass dome filled 143 
with a lightweight aggregate  (LWA)  from which  wastewater is pumped at a rate of around 25 144 
pulses/day . The second step of the treatment system involves  the flow of water through a 145 
saturated bed filled with Filtralite -P® media , which is  a LWA  product chemically enriched , 146 
specifically engineered for phosphorus removal ( see details in Jenssen et al., 2010) . Different 147 
wastewater treatment systems  studied are shown in Figure 1 and their operational and design 148 
characteristics are shown in Table 1 . 149 
 150 
The flow conditions within the systems control  the oxygen availability and therefore, anoxic 151 
conditions predominate d in saturated HFCWs while oxic  conditions prevail in VFCWs  152 
(Vymazal  et al.,  2006; Brix and  Arias, 2005).  153 
 154 
On the other hand, because of the combination of two different modules, oxic conditions are 155 
found in the first section of BF system s, while anoxic conditions develop  in the  P remo val 156 
bed.  157  
 6 2.2 Soil and water sampling  158 
 159 
Soil samples were taken  in May 2010 from each system (Figure 1 and Figure 2), the  two 160 
HFCW (HFCW 1 and HFCW 2), the two BF (BF 1 and BF2) and the two VFCW  (1 and 2). 161 
When sampling HFCW, because of the horizontal flo w, two separated zones were 162 
differentiated and samples were taken at the influent (I) and effluent (E) zone, and considered 163 
separately. In the case of BF, samples were also taken in two different parts of the system : in 164 
the first module (also represented as  I) and in the main bed (E). Sampling points are shown 165 
with arrows in Figure 1.  166 
 167 
Three subsamples were collected  in each sampling point  at random by means of a core (1 m 168 
length, 2.54 cm diameter) and then mixed to yield one composite sample per point . Samples 169 
were stored at 4ºC, and processed within 24h.  170 
 171 
Grab water samples from influent and effluent were taken  in three sampling campaigns , once 172 
a month between March and May 2010. Each campaign consisted of three consecutive 173 
sampling days. Samples were frozen at -20ºC until they were processed.  174 
 175 
2.3 Water analysi s 176 
 177 
The water quality parameters measured included in situ  measurements of water temperature, 178 
oxygen saturation and electric conductivity  as standard water control  by means of calibrated 179 
electrodes . Additional water quality analysis included BOD5  determination using  180 
APHA5210B method, and nitrogen species  such as  total nitrogen  (Kjeldhal Method) , 181 
ammonia (APHA 4500  NH3 D method) , nitrit e (APHA 4500 NO 2 B method)  and nitrate  182 
(APHA 4500- NO 3- F method).  183 
 184 
2.4 Soil DNA extraction  185 
 186 
A total of 100 g for each composite sample were collected  in 100 ml of sterile saline solution 187 
(9 % NaCl) and sonicated for 5 minutes in  an ultraso nic water bath (Selecta, Barcelona, 188 
Spain) . Samples were also vortexed 1 min to release the biofilm attached to the solution  into 189 
the liquid phase. Subsequently, 10 ml were recovered and concentrated by centrifugation (5 190 
min, 8,000 g) , and  then samples  were stored at -20ºC until further processing. DNA 191 
extractions were performed using the EZNA® Soil DNA kit (Omega Bio -Tek, Doraville, 192 
USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations.  193  
 7 2.5 PCR amplification, DGGE and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes  194 
 195 
Amplifica tion of 16S rRNA gene fragments  for DGGE analysis was perform ed by using the 196 
bacterial specific primer set 358 F with a 40bp GC clamp, and the universal primer 907R M 197 
(Sánchez et al., 2007). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with a Biometra 198 
therm ocycler using the following pr ogram: initial denaturation at 94  ºC for 5 min, 10 199 
touchdown cycles of denaturation (at 94 ºC for 1 min), annealing (at 63.5 ºC to 53.5 ºC for 1 200 
min, decreasing 1ºC each cycle), and extension at 72 ºC for 3 min. This procedure was 201 
followed by  20 additional  cycles at an annealing temperature of 53.5 ºC. During the last cycle 202 
of the program, the length of the extension  step was 15 min at 72 ºC.  203 
 204 
Primers 344 F-GC and 915R were used for archaeal 16S rRNA gene fragment amplification 205 
(Casamayor et al., 2002). The  PCR protocol included an initial denaturation step at 94 ºC for 206 
5 min, followed by 20 touchdown cycles of denaturation (at 94 ºC for 1 min), annealing (a t 71 207 
ºC to 61 ºC  for 1 min, decreasing 1  ºC each cycle), and extension (at 72 ºC for 3 min); 20 208 
standa rd cycles (annealing  at 55  ºC, 1 min) and a final extension at 72 ºC for 5 min.  209 
 210 
PCR mixtures contained 1 -10 ng of template DNA, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a 211 
concentration of 200µM , 1.5 mM MgCl 2, each primer at a concentration of 0.3 µM , 2.5 U Taq 212 
DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and PCR buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Bovine Serum 213 
Albumin  (BSA) at a final concentration of 600 µg ml-1 was added to minimize the inhibitory 214 
effect of humic substances (Kreader, 1996). The volume of reactions was 50 µl . PCR products 215 
were verified and quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis , with a low DNA mass ladder 216 
standard (Invitrogen).  217 
 218 
The DGGE was run in a DCode system (Bio -Rad) as described by Muyzer et al. (1998). A 219 
6% polyacrylamide gel with a gradient of 40- 80% DNA denaturant agent was cast by mixing 220 
solutions of 0% and 80% denaturant agent (100% denaturant agent is 7 M urea and 40% 221 
deionized formamide). Seven hundred ng of PCR product were loaded for each sample and 222 
the gel s were run at 100 V for 18 h at 60°C in 1 x TAE buffer (40 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 20 mM 223 
sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA). The gel was stained with SybrGold (Molecular Probes) for 45 224 
min, rinsed with 1 x TAE buffer, removed from the glass plate to a UV -transparent gel scoop , 225 
and visualized with UV in a Chemi  Doc EQ (Bio -Rad). Prominent bands were excised from 226 
the gels, resuspended in milli -q water overnight and reamplified for their sequencing.  227 
 228  
 8 Purification of PCR products from DGGE bands and sequencing reactions were performed by 229 
Macrogen (South Korea) with primer 907R M for B acteria and primer 915 R for A rchaea. PCR 230 
products of the reamplified bands were used as DNA template in a sequencing reaction with 231 
the Big Dye Terminator version 3.1 sequencing kit in an automatic ABI 3730XL Analyzer -96 232 
capillary type. Sequences were subjected to a BLAST search (Altschul et al., 1997) to obtain 233 
an indication of the phylogenetic affiliation .     234 
 235 
Fifty -six 16S bacterial rRNA gene sequences were s ubmitted  to the EMBL database 236 
(http://www. ebi.ac.uk/embl) and received the following accession numbers: from HE716787  237 
to HE716842.  238 
 239 
2.6 Analysis of DGGE patterns and statistical analyses  240 
 241 
Digitalized  DGGE images were analy sed with the Quantity One software (Bio -Rad, Hercules, 242 
USA). Bands occupying the same position in the different lanes of the gels were identified. A 243 
matrix was constructed for all lanes, taking into account the presence or absence of the 244 
individual bands. Raup -Crick in dex was used for absence -presence data as this index utilizes  245 
a randomization procedure (Monte Carlo) comparing the observed number of species 246 
occurring in both samples in 200 pairs of random replicates of the pooled sample. The PAST 247 
program (Hammer et al 2004) was used for theses analyses.  248 
 249 
DGGE banding data were used to calculate the Shannon–Weaver index as a me asure of the 250 
diversity of microbial  communities.  It was calculated using the following function:  251 
H’  252 
Where n is the number of bands in the sample and pi the relative intensity of the  band .  253 
 254 
3. Results  and discussion 255 
 256 
The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the structure of pro karyotic 257 
communities established in three  different types of natural wastewater treatment systems, 258 
each with different substrate and configuration. Analysis of bacterial and archaeal communit y 259 
composition from the substrate samples collected was  performed by means of PCR -DGGE. 260 
The banding pattern s for the 16S rRNA  gene  DGGE -PCR amplicons are presented in Fig. 2  261 
for Bacteria and Archaea. Clear differences could be observed in both gels concerning band 262 ∑=

1ln   - =  i
  ii ip p 
 9 position, intensity and band number for the different samples, demonstrating that different 263 
bacterial and archaeal communities developed in the different systems.  264 
 265 
In the bacterial DGGE, a high number of bands could be observed in all lanes  (Fig. 2A) . Band 266 
richness fluctuated from 31 in HFCW1I to 17 in the BF1E system  (Table 2) . Significant 267 
differences were found in total band richness among the influents and effluents (p < 0.05), 268 
influents harbouring h igher richness than eff luents (27 and 21 mean band richness for 269 
influents and effluents respec tively). Similar results were found for Shannon diversity indexes 270 
(2.65 and 2.25 for influents and effluents respectively). On the other hand, although archaeal 271 
amplification was also found, the  DGGE banding profile clearly revealed a lower  diversity in 272 
comparison with the bacterial community  (Fig. 2B) .  273 
 274 
Excision of prominent bacterial DGGE bands and subsequent sequencing allowed the 275 
characterization of the predominant microorganisms in the different systems studied. 276 
Informative sequences w ere obtained from 56 bacterial bands. The number of bases used to 277 
calculate each similarity value is also shown in Table 3, as an indication of the quality of the 278 
sequence. Unfortunately, bands recovered from the archaeal DGGE gel yield ed sequences 279 
with a very poor quality that have not been included in this study. The most represented 280 
taxonomic groups in all samples belong ed to the γ -Proteobacteria (26% of recovered bands) 281 
and Bacteroidetes (26%). Firmicutes (15%)  were present in all systems with the exception of 282 
samples from VFCW. Members of the Actinobacteria group, although found in HFCW and 283 
VFCW , seem ed to be more abundant in B F systems. Finally, some representatives of α , ß and 284 
δ-Proteobacteria, A cidobacteria and Chloroflexi were also retrieved  in some of the samples.  285 
 286 
Most of the sequences corresponded to uncultured microorganisms  (71% of the retrieved 287 
sequences ), while others matched with a high percentage of similarity to cultured bacteria  288 
(29%). In general, typical bacteria from soil and wastewater environments were found in all 289 
the systems analyzed . For example, we could retrieve in HFCW typical soil bacteria such as 290 
sequences related to Acinetobacter sp. (γ-Proteobacteria) , Arthrobacter sp (from the 291 
Actinobacteria  group, also found in samples from VFCW and BF), and Bacillus sp. 292 
(Firmicutes), all of them potential denitrifying bacteria . Besides,  other  non-culturable  matches 293 
corresponding to different groups were present. Acinetobacter sp. is commo nly present in 294 
activated sludge  (Snaird el al. 1997) especially  in those where enhanced biological phosphate 295 
removal is observed (Ivanov et al ., 2005) . On the other hand, Arthrobacter sp has been related 296 
to the nitrogen cycle, particularly to nitr ogen fixation (Cacciari et al. 1971) . The fact that 297  
 10 some aerobic microorganisms have been found suggests that although HFCW systems are 298 
mostly all the time saturated, enough oxygen is present to allow proliferation of these 299 
microbial groups, with the subse quent possibility of nitrification in the system. Oxygen is 300 
present probably due to plant aeration and also because the upper part of the bed normally 301 
remains unsaturated.  302 
 303 
Concerning the Bacteroidetes phylum , a group of chemoheterotrophic bacteria known b y its 304 
ability to degrade complex organic matter, sequences with a high similarity at the species 305 
level were found. Thus, some of the retrieved sequences related to Flavobacterium sp., 306 
another potential denitrifying bacteria, and have been  detected in VFCW and BF ; it is a 307 
typical genus that can be found in activated sludge (Park et al. 2007). Another sequence 308 
similar to the denitrifying Thauera terpenica (cultured closest match 99.6% similarity) was 309 
also observed in VFCWs. Other species wer e also found in BF systems, such as sequences 310 
related to the γ-Proteobacteria Xanthomonas sp., Dokdonella sp., and some denitrifying 311 
bacteria such as Rhodanobacter sp. and Stenotrophomonas sp.  312 
 313 
The application of molecular techniques (PCR -DGGE profiling) on different wastewater 314 
treatment systems has allowed the identification of some players and their potential role in the 315 
nitrogen removal processes. The diversity of N -cycling bacteria found in the analyzed 316 
systems is an indicator of the multiple possibili ties of biological nitrogen transformations 317 
inside them. In addition, this profiling method is a useful tool to classify microbial 318 
community under different substrates by clustering and diversity analyses.  319 
 320 
A cluster analysis of bacterial DGGE banding pat terns  based in band richness  is shown in Fig. 321 
3. Samples separated in two clusters; samples coming from VFCW and BFI , corresponding to 322 
unsaturated samples  with a high organic load (Table 1) , clustered together in one of the two 323 
main clusters, while all the  other samples, corresponding to saturated systems  with low 324 
organic load, clustered in another group. As there is  almost no relation between the influent 325 
and e ffluent bacterial communities inside the same wetland, t hese results suggest that factors 326 
other t han the influent waste water, such as the organic load and the design of the  treatment 327 
system , contribute to shape the microbial community.   328 
 329 
Previous studies have shown that shifts in the structure of bacterial communities can be 330 
associated with changes in  a number of soil properties , including soil texture and soil nitrogen 331 
availability (Dong et al, 2010). The substrate is an important component since it supports 332 
plant growth (in case of planted wetland  systems) , as well as the establishment of a microbial 333  
 11 biofilm, and it influences the hydraulic processes (Stottmeister et al., 2003). A  porous matrix 334 
substrate such as LWA  will probably favour the development of biofilms. Additionally, recent 335 
studies concluded that the type of substrate is one of the main factors influencing bacterial 336 
communities (Vacca et al, 2005, Calheiros et al, 2009). However, none of these studies took 337 
place in real constructed wetlands; both of them consisted in different pilot systems, with the 338 
same influent water. In our study, no relation between the microbial assemblage and the 339 
substrate was found, as different communities were retrieved  within systems with the same 340 
substrate. On the contrary, from the cluster analysis we did observe  two separated groups that 341 
appear ed to be influe nced by factors such as the organic load, as well as for  the 342 
absence/presence of oxygen, since one of the groups is composed only by samples from 343 
unsaturated samples , which receive a higher load of organic matter  (VFCW and influent of 344 
BF), and the other group by saturated conditions with a lower load of organic matter (HFCW 345 
influent and effluent zone, and BF effluent zone). Since influent water is different for each 346 
system, the results suggest  a community configuration more related with the design of the 347 
treatment system and its operational conditions . These results are in consonance with the 348 
work carried out  by Baptista et al. (2008) , who suggested that stochastic processes could  play 349 
an important role in the microbial community assembly in engineered and natural systems.  350 
 351 
Different authors, such as Ibekwe et al (2003) and Calheiros et al. (2009) indicated that the 352 
diversity of the bacterial community in the constructed wetland s systems  might influence the 353 
final effluent quality, and so the engineering should be directed to develop  a higher diversity 354 
in order to enhance processes such as nitrification and denitrification (Ibekwe et al. 2003). 355 
The Shannon index obtained for our samples showed a very similar diversity for all the 356 
samples. S ignificant differences (p -value<0.05) were  only found between HFCW and BF.  357 
 358 
On the other hand, despite we could not retrieve sequences directly affiliated to known 359 
nitrifiers, nitrogen removal occurred in all the systems evaluated, although the removal rates 360 
were different among systems (Table 1). Saturated systems did not reach high nitrification 361 
rates but they were able to denitrify almost all the nitrified ammonia . Unsaturated systems 362 
were capable of hi gh nitrification rates but total nitrogen removal was lower than unsaturated  363 
CW. 364 
 365 
The removal of nitrogen in constructed wetlands is usually  limited by the nitrification process , 366 
and in order to reach high total nitrification rates is important that biological nitrification takes 367 
place. Additionally, in order to increase denitrification rates in the unsaturated systems , the 368 
establishment of recycling or an additional step is a mus t. In this sense, the application of 369  
 12 molecular techniques in this study has revealed the presence of several groups of denitrifiers. 370 
Finally, the diversity for bacterial groups has proven to be higher than for archaeal 371 
representatives . Further studies are needed to assess the activity of these groups under 372 
different conditions, and to go deeper into the functional groups present in each system.  373 
 374 
4. Conclusions  375 
 376 
-The application of molecular techniques (PCR -DGGE profiling) on different wastewater 377 
treatment systems showed that there is no relation between the influent and effluent bacterial 378 
communities inside the same treatment system.  379 
 380 
-Microbial community structure was related to the oxygen conditions (saturated or 381 
unsaturated) and organic matter load.  382 
 383 
-High diversity of bacteria was found in all systems studied. A lower archaeal diversity was 384 
found in comparison with the bacterial population . 385
