*Corresponding author (maria.martins.15@ucl.ac.uk)2 Unoccupied  aerial system (UAS) surveys of  large populations of animals that form herds have been 
used in the context of ecology and conservatio n (Koh and Wich 2012, Anderson and Gaston 2013 , 
Hodgson et al. 2016). UAS can capture high resolution overhead imagery on  dense groupings of 
animals, helping to overcome the limitations of a lateral perspective from boat or land  based surveys 
(Ries et al . 1998 , Hodgson et al. 2016).   
UA
S can monitor a variety of species , including marine mammals (Hodgson et al . 2016, Smith et al . 
2016, Rhodes and Spiegel 2017, Christiansen et al . 2018) . While UAS may cause  visual and acoustic 
disturbance o f marine mammals, especially pinnipeds that rest on land, if maintained above 
altitudes where behavior al responses are observed, UAS surveys  can be performed  without major 
disturbance (Pomeroy et al . 2015, Christiansen et al . 2016 , Smith et al . 2016 , Rhodes and Spiegel 
2017) .  However, the physiological effects of UAS flights on seal populations are unknown (Ditmer et 
al. 2013). UAS surveys  have been used for marine mammal  abundance (Hodgson et al . 2016, 
Sweeney et al . 2016) and photographic identific ation  studies (Pomeroy et al . 2015 ), but not 
extensively for detecting anthropogenic impacts on populations , such as entanglements in 
pinnipeds.  
M
arine mammal entanglements are common globally (Laist 1997, Page et al , 2004, Boren et al . 
2006) and were  defined by Laist, 1997 as ‘interactions between marine life and entanglement 
material whereby the loops and openings of various type of anthropogenic debris entangle animal 
appendages or entrap animals’. Entanglements  can involve  abandoned or ‘ ghost’ fishing gear , active 
fishing gear in use at the time of entanglement, or nonfishery derived debris  (Laist 1997, Raum -
Suryan et al . 2009, Asmutis-Silvia et al . 2017) .  
E
ntanglement associated mortality  in seals can be acute due to drowning or asphyxiation in gear  or 
chronic through  secondary complications of  injuries  or feeding impairment (Moore et al . 2013).  3 Circumferential entanglements, such as encircling neck wraps of gear, are regarded as serious 
injuries under NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Guidelin es for Distinguishing Serious from 
Non Serious Injury of M arine Mammals pursuant to t he U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, 
therefore it is likely that these entanglements lead to the animal’s mortality (Hanni and Pyle 2000 , 
Date 2012) .  
C
alculating the prevalence of entanglements  in pinnipeds  has been shown  to be challenging, due to 
the d ifficulty in  monitoring seal interactions with deployed fishing gear, the lack of observ ed deaths 
caused by entanglements at sea , and the limitations of observing entangle ments during surveys . 
Existing prevalence estimations are biased towards an underestimation of entanglement (Laist, 1997, Hanni and Pyle 2000, Page et al . 2004 , Raum -Suryam et al . 2009). While acute entanglement 
mortality is estimated routinely in New England waters, p revalence of longer term gray  seal 
(Halichoerus grypus ) and harbor  seal ( Phoca vitulina) entanglements on the East Coast of the United 
States of America have yet to be determined (Hayes et al . 2017, Jackman et al . 2018).  
Th
e primary objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of live entangle d gray and harbor 
seals  in discrete haul -outs across Massachusetts and Maine, USA, by analyzing UAS survey  data . The 
study also examined the spatial distribution  of entangle d seals  within discrete h aul-outs  and the 
feasibility of identifying entanglement material. Furthermore, the study assessed the efficacy of the 
UAS method to accomplish the study objectives.  
Two types of UAS (I nspire  1RAW dji.com or APH 22 aerialimagingsolutions.com) were used to fly 
over haul -outs of seals. A 45  mm micro 4/3 1:1.8 Olympus lens or 25  mm micro 4/3 F1.8 Olympus 
lens was used on each UAS.  Serial overlapping still images of the animals were recorded . Video 
footage was recorded  on some of the Inspire flights. On each day sampled, flights were made with 
the camera angle vertically o r obliquely above the seal haul -outs at an altitude sufficient to avoid 4 any sign of disturbance , such as head lifting (Smith et al . 2014, Rhodes and Spieg el 2017). The 
method used to avoid disturbance was commencing the UAS flight at very high altitude (about 55m) 
and decreasing altitude slowly until head lifting was observed. Once observed, the altitude was 
increased and kept above that threshold level for the duration of the flight. The altitude at which this 
occurred varied with location and season. Surveys ( see Electronic Supplement, Table 1) were 
conducted seasonally from June 2017 to August  2018. Time  and latitude and longitude for each 
flight w ere obtained from the flight logs.  Location of seal haul- outs shown where UAS was overflown 
seen in Figure 1.

(41⁰32’28’’N, 70 ⁰0’43’’W), Isle of Shoals (43 ⁰0’17’’N, 70 ⁰36’10’’W) and Head of the Meadow 
(42⁰3’35’’N, 70⁰5’47’’W). 
5 For haul -outs to be assessed independently, only 1 flight per  site per day could be used due to seal 
movement s between and within haul -outs. This was done to avoid double counting of individuals. 
For each site, the flight with the best quality images was selected and an image of the whole seal 
haul -out was constructed by stitching together  the serial overlapping images (Fig . 2) using Microsoft 
PowerPoint . A total count was undertaken  using Image -J cell counter plug-in  (Scheinder et al.  2012, 
O’Brien et al . 2016) . Total counts of each haul -out site were made three  times. If numbers of total 
seals differed  between the 3 counts, a mean 
was taken. Only animals where head, neck , and 
body were fully visible were included in the 
count  and assessed for entanglement (see 
Electronic Supplement, Table 2).  
Images used to stitch complete haul -outs were  
then  enlarged between 2 -4 times in order to 
examine each individual seal for any sign of entanglement. In this study, entanglement was  
determined as tight constrictions around neck 
or body ( with or without material or gear 
visible)  or a circumferential wound around  the 
neck  or body . Seals with superficial linear 
impressions  and no visible material were not 
included in the entanglement count as we could not confidently confirm such cases as 
entanglements. The definition agreed for this study was a suitable description based on the 
resolution of imagery obtained. Other descriptions from other studies were not considered to avoid overcounting of entanglements.  Video footage, when available, was used to confirm entangled 
individuals  and material type . Entanglements were counted per site for any given day, and individual 
photos of entangled seals were cataloged (Fig. 3). Isle of Shoals, Maine was the only site with a 
Figure 2-Example of stitch  up produced for 
gray seal counts of total haul-out . Images 
taken on 26th June, 2017.  6 mixture of gray and harbor seal haul- outs, however, only gray seal entanglements were detected. No 
harbor seals were seen at the Massachusetts sites. For the analyses, due to the lack of harbor seal 
entanglements, only gray seals were included. Identifying seal species was  done using facial 
characteristics, body shape features , and coat color (Hannah 2006) . Prevalence  was calculated for 
each site and day sampled for gray  seals only. Prevalence was defined as: n umber of 
entanglements/ total gray seal count, and converted into a percentage. 
Bas
ed on the video and still images, only one type of material could be identified and that was  
monofilament net so each entanglement was categorized as either monofilament net or ‘ cannot be 
identified ’.  Monofilament net is identified from UAS imagery as a laterally extending, 2D knotted 
structure, often with flaring ends from the entanglement.  
E
ntangled individuals were then analyzed  according to their location within the specific haul -outs. 
Individuals that  were within 3 animals from the edge of t he haul -out were classified as ‘Edge’  and 
those that were more than 3 animals from the edge were classified as ‘Middle’ . This analysis was 
done to test whether there was a tendency for entanglements to be found on the edges of haul -
outs. Unpublished preliminary studies on boat based methods to detect entanglements, showed a much higher prevalence than obtained through the UAS. Boat based methods cannot detect 
‘Middle’ entanglements or produce a complete total population count. Therefore, if entanglements 
are shown to be concentrated on the edges, it is possible that boat based methods hyperinflate 
prevalence.  
To test any association between lo cation and entanglement counts, a Pearson’s Chi -Squared test 
was conducted. The mean prevalence  for each site per location of entanglement ( Edge or M iddle) 
was also calculated .  All statistical analyses were conducted on R studio (Rstudio Team 2015).  7 Figu

at each site): Chatham - North Cut ( n=7), Chatham - Main Haul-out ( n=5), Chatham - Monomoy Island 
(n=1), Isle of Shoals  (n=5) and Head of the Meadow ( n=3).  
M
ean prevalence ( n=number of days surveye d) was calculated for each specific site (Fig . 4). Mean 
prevalence for each site was calculated using the sum of all entanglement prevalences divided by 
n=number of days surveyed. The  mean prevalence ranged from 0.83% at the Isle of Shoals ( n=5) to 
3.7% on  Chatham - Monomoy Island ( n=1), the site with the highest prevalence. Across all sites, the 
mean prevalence of gray seal entanglement was 1.30% ( n=21, s=1.15 ). Across all Massachusetts sites 
(excluding the Isle of Shoals) , the mean prevalence of gray seal entanglement was 1.44% ( n=16, 
s=0.88). The prevalence for all the Chatham sites (North Cut, Main Haul- out and Monomoy Island, 
n=13, s=0.92) was 1.54%.

O
nly two of the sites (C hatham - North Cut and Main Haul-out) had individuals w ith identifiable  
entangling material, which was monofilament net  in all cases . Across all sites , 22.4 % of all 
entanglements were classified as monofilament net and in the remaining 77.6%,  the type of gear 
could not be identi fied. Chatham -North Cut had the highest number of monofilament net entangled 
individuals identified, with 40.4% being monofilament net and 59.6% being unidentified.  
T

mean prevalence per location and per site. There was a statistically  significan t difference between 
location within the herd (Edge or Middle) and entanglement count  (P<0.05) in two sites: Chatham - 
North Cut and Main Haul -out, with entangled sea ls being found more commonly on the Edge . 
Although not statistically significant elsewhere, this pattern was consistent across all sites  (Edge – 
1.08% and Middle – 0.22%) .  10 Table 2 -Gray seal entanglements on the Edge and M iddle of hau l-outs: count (% prev alence),  P value

C
onfirmed entanglement cases ranged from obvious monofilament net constrictions to deep and 
wide wounds that exposed underlying blubber and occasionally muscle.  Considering the low 
probability of marine mammals shedding entanglements over time , our study  assume d that all s eals 
with open neck wounds and constrictions, even in the absence of visible gear, were entangled at the 
time of imaging (Laist et al . 1997 , Page et al . 2004).   Entangling material lacking extending strands or 
trailing gear and/or occurring within a deep wound is difficult to detect from aerial images (UAS or 
plane), and accompanying videos were useful in improving entanglement evaluations in many of these cases.  Due to seal movements between and within ha ul-outs, only one flight per site per day could be used, 
which led to small sample size s, especially for Chatham - Monomoy Island  (n=1). Some sites including 
Isle of Shoals and Chatham -Monomoy Island are difficult and costly to visit which is reflected in the 
small sample sizes. For futur e research,  more UAS flights are recommended.  The extent of 11 movement between and within haul -outs needs to be quantified to better define optimal survey 
effort on a given day.  
 I
t is assumed that the total entanglement count presented here is an underest imation as seals with 
just linear impressions around neck and body were not confirmed to be entangled. Many entangled 
seals become lost or die at sea which are also not included in the estimate. The entanglement prevalence was comparable  between sites except for Chatham - Monomoy Island. This may be due 
to th e single UAS survey at that  site that surveyed only a small portion of the entire haul -out. More 
UAS flights would be needed on Chatham - Monomoy Island haul -out for a better assessment of the 
site. The I sle of Shoals site also had limited UAS data, leading to low seal counts and only two 
detected entanglements. This limited data set does not reflect the high entanglement prevalence for 
harbor and gray seals assessed with 30-40 boat  based surveys per season  on the Isle of Shoals  
between May -August, 2011 -2018 (A. Bogomolni pers. c om).   Additional gray seal haul- out sites, 
such as Muskeget Island and Nantucket should also be considered in future studies.   
P
revalence (0.83% in the Isle of Shoals to 3. 7% in Chatham -Monomoy Island) can be extrapolated to 
current minimum population estimate of gray seals in U.S. Atlantic waters of 23,158 ( Hayes et al . 
2018) , the minimum total number of entangled gray seals could be estimated to range from 192 to 
857 (0.83% to 3.7%) , according to our calculated prevalences. Though this cannot be considered an 
annual estimate, since a few entangled seals have been known to survive for years, this number can be compared to the annual mortality estimates resulting from bycatch  in northeast fisheries. The 
fisheries bycatch estimates are calculated based on observed rates of mortality extrapolated over the total effort in the fisheries (Chavez -Rosales et al . 2017, Orphanides and Hatch 2017).  During the 
years 2011 -2015 estimated gray seal mortalities averaged 1,020 (4.33% of the current minimum 
population estimate) per year in northeast sink gillnet fisheries, and 31 (0.13% of the current 
minimum population estimate) per year in northeast bottom trawl fisheries (Hayes et al . 2018) . 12 During this same period, 4 gray seals or seals of undetermined species reported by fisheries 
observers were determined to have had sub -lethal interactions with gillnet or trawl fishing gear 
(Josephson et al . 2017).  Therefore, the extrapolated estimates from this current study strongly 
suggest that the incidence of sublethal interactions between gillnets and gray seals in the Cape Cod area is grossly underestimated when relying on observer data alone.   
W
hether the prevalence of entangled 
seals within haul -outs is 
representative of that of the population at large is unknown. A significant  limitation to measuring 
sublethal entanglement prevalence is that marine mammals tend to be 
highly migratory and dispers e widely , 
so sampling of entanglements in 
pinniped populations solely on -shore 
may not depict true prevalence (Laist et al . 1997, Hanni and Pyle 20 00). 
Additionally, these surveys were limited to the summer and early fall, which also may affect perceived entanglement prevalence.

13 The UAS images  did not provide enough resolution to ident ify the type of material in 77.6 % of all 
entanglement cases. A lens with greater focal length and resolution  would be needed to attempt to 
capture the full detail of the entanglement, given that a lower altitude would result in disturbance 
and flushing of the hauled out seals . However, a  larger resolution lens would need a larger UAS 
which in turn also causes more disturbance, resulting in the need to fly higher to avoid such 
disturbance.   
Bo
at based survey s may be able to provide higher resolution images to assist in gear identification , 
but often with deeply embedded entanglements, only physical examination or necropsy will be definitive in this respect ( Fig. 5 ). Recommendations for future research include conducting boat  
based survey s simultaneously to UAS survey s to complement the greater  spatial coverage  that the 
UAS imagery can provide  with the  more detailed  boat  based imagery  for better entanglement type 
identification . If necropsied or stranded animals could be linked to UAS or boat based data , a better 
understanding of entangling material and wound severity  would result.  
Gray
 seal entanglement in m onofilament  fishing gear reflects the presence  of gillnet fisheries in New 
England (Read et al . 2006 , Orphanides and Hatch 2017) . Recreational fisheries using monofilament 
lines are als o present in New England, but their role in entanglements are unclear due to the cryptic 
nature of a single line wrap within a wound compared with gillnet monofilament net which extends more laterally given its knotted two dimensional structure.  Monofilament line can potentially wrap 
around and cause a constriction through drag of the trailing  line and become multiple simply  by the 
animal turning. However,  in 20 yr of documenting live and dead entangled pinnipeds on Cape Cod 
and Southeastern, MA, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), which is the permitted 
agency for stranded marine mammal response in that area, has never identified a neck entanglement caused by monofilament line (unpublished data, IFAW 2018).  Whether these 
entanglements are caused by active fishing gear or abandoned gear is another uncertainty but in this 14 study,  it is assumed to be actively fished gear due to the high prevalence of year- round gillnet 
fisheries , documented  interactions between fisheries and seals, and lack of fouling on the entangling 
gear as would be expected with ‘ghost’ gear ( Bogomolni et al . 2010, Asmutis -Silvia et al . 2017, 
Orphanides and Hatch 2017).  
Th
e higher entangled seal prevalence identified at the haul -out E dge vs. Middle in Chatham ’s North  
Cut, and Main  Haul -outs would not have been possible to detect using boat based surveys alone 
since this method does not have photographic access to seals in the middle of the haul -out.  It is also 
important to note that based on these results, boat based  surveys will overestimate entanglement 
prevalence because they are biased towards the edges of haul- outs. However, due to the relatively 
small sample size of this study, conducting boat and UAS surveys in tandem are required to 
investigate this further.  
W
hile reasons for the observed marginalization of entangled seals cannot be identified through this 
study,  poorer health  may be a contributing factor.  Further study on the health implications of 
chronic entanglements would help to elucidate their impacts on gray seals.  
T
he population of gray seals in Massachusetts and Maine needs regular monitoring and surveying 
and UAS has shown encouraging results when it comes to estimating prevalence of entanglements. This study improves our understanding of fisheries  entanglement within these seal populations and 
will help better inform potential mitigation efforts to improve their welfare and conservation.
