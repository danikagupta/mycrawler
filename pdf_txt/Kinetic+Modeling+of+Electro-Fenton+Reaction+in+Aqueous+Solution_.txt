ABSTRACT
This study presents the removal of triarylmethane dye Bromocresol Green from aqueous solution by the electro-Fenton process. As catalysts
ﬁve different cations were used: Fe2þ,C e3þ,N i2þ,M n2þ, and Co2þ. They play crucial roles in the whole process because they react with H 2O2
producing hydroxyl radicals that are capable of breaking down dye molecules. Based on this, a comparison of catalytic activity of these
cations in the electro-Fenton process is made for Bromocresol Green degradation. A simple and universal kinetic model is also applied tostudy the catalytic activity of investigated catalysts. Due to its multidimensionality it is ﬁtted to experimental data using a genetic algorithm.
The procedure of ﬁtting using a genetic algorithm is thoroughly described and demonstrated. The activity of utilized catalysts is compared
based on both experimental and model data revealing that for Bromocresol Green removal all alternative catalysts (Ni
2þ,C o2þ,C e3þ,
Mn2þ) are better than the typical one (Fe2þ, 51.83% degradation). The best catalyst is Co2þwith 78.35% degradation ef ﬁciency. Moreover,
the adopted kinetic model proved its universality and outlined different interactions between catalysts and dye molecules.
Key words: Bromocresol Green, decolorization, electro-Fenton process, genetic algorithm, kinetic model

GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION
Synthetic dyes are often used to color many different products, for example textiles, cosmetics, food, paper and chemicals
(El-Desoky et al. (2010) ,Panizza & Oturan (2011) ). Likewise they are used as pH indicators in organic analytics. Despite
being widely used in industry, synthetic dyes have many disadvantages. Aromatic rings, which dyes usually contain, makes

these colored compounds chemically durable and biologically recalcitrant ( Rosales et al. (2009) ). Therefore their presence in
water causes non-aesthetic pollution and danger for the environment.
Conventional physico-chemical treatment of dyeing wastewater usually results in generation of secondary waste products,
such as sludge ( El-Desoky et al. (2010) ), so the majority of these pollutants cannot be degraded. Advanced oxidation pro-
cesses such as Fenton ’s reaction (2), are a more effective removal alternative. The electro-Fenton method is based on
oxidation, due to intensive production of hydroxyl radicals, which attack dye molecules ( Panizza & Oturan (2011) ). Dis-
solved molecular O 2is continuously reduced to hydrogen peroxide (1) ( Rosales et al. (2009) ,El-Desoky et al. (2010) )a t
the cathode, under control of applied current. Fenton ’s reaction is coupled with iron oxidation, but in order to remove
highly reactive and iron sludge productive Fe3þions from the solution ( Rosales et al. (2009) ), it is rapidly regenerated at
the cathode (3). Reactions are conducted in acidic medium:
O2þ2Hþþ2e/C0!H2O2 (1)
Fe2þþH2O2þHþ!Fe3þþH2OþOH†(2)
Fe3þþe/C0!Fe2þ(3)
The molecular oxygen that is necessary for the production of H 2O2is generated by oxidizing water in the anodic process
(4) (Brillas & Martinez-Huitle (2015) ). Oxygen can also be supplied from external sources (e. g. air) by continuously passing
through a reaction mixture:
2H2O!4HþþO2þ4e/C0(4)
Adding up the processes occurring at the electrodes and in the solution (1 –4) we get following summary reaction of the
electro-Fenton process (5):
1=2O2þH2O!2OH/C1(5)
In situ generation of H 2O2avoids the need for transport and storage of this hazardous substance, offers safer operation by
virtue of providing diluted H 2O2solutions and enhances the mixing of solutions ( Rosales et al. (2009) ). Therefore the electro-
Fenton process is environmentally friendly. Moreover this method is ef ﬁcient in degrading organic molecules and easy to
implement (for example 95% removal of Alizarin Red S ( Panizza & Oturan (2011) )).
Modi ﬁcations of the electro-Fenton process were investigated in terms of the applied catalyst. It turned out that ef ﬁciency of
degradation can be enhanced by using catalysts alternative to Fe2þ, such as Cuþ,M n2þand Co2þcations ( Leonard et al.
(1998) ,Bokare & Choi (2014) ). Moreover, recently novel, two-electron type, catalysts (Sn2þ,B i3þ) have been reported
(Matyszczak et al. (2020b) ). Use of cations of other metals gives the possibility for increasing performance of the electro-
Fenton process due to differences in interplay of catalyst cations with dye molecules.
The electro-Fenton process is a complex system of many reactions, therefore the most suitable way to investigate kinetics of
this process is the kinetic model. Such an approach has been found to be very useful and many times leads to results being in
good agreement with experimental data ( Liuet al. (2007) ,Mousset et al. (2016) ,Nakagawa et al. (2016) ). Many so far pre-
sented kinetic models of the electro-Fenton process include speci ﬁc pathways and intermediate compounds, thus they are
limited to types of pollutants for which they were constructed. Organic molecules of different types are expected to have dis-
tinct pathways of degradation. Matyszczak et al. (2020a) considered only the most important reactions in the process and
proposed a simple kinetic model based on the rate-limiting step approximation that is independent of the type of pollutantmolecule. This model has been validated for azo dyne Metanil Yellow.
Kinetic models may include many parameters and therefore, due to their multidimensionality, they are hard to ﬁt to exper-
imental data using conventional methods. Luckily, there exist global optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms. Forexample, they are able to solve NP-hard problems (a problem is NP-hard if an algorithm for solving it can be translated into
one for solving any NP problem (nondeterministic polynomial time) problem) like the traveling salesman problem –ﬁnding
the shortest and the most moneymaking way for the salesman through certain cities knowing prices of goods in each city anddistances between them ( Vikhar (2017) ,Hussain et al. (2017) ). More interestingly, they proved their utility in a variety ofWater Science & Technology Vol 84 No 10-11, 3228

This paper investigates the removal of triarylmethane dye Bromocresol Green from aqueous solution using ﬁve different
catalysts: Fe2þ,M n2þ,C o2þ,N i2þand Ce3þin the electro-Fenton process. A simpli ﬁed kinetic model proposed by Matyszczak
et al. (2020a) is adopted and its universality is veri ﬁed. The catalytic activity of distinct catalysts is compared based on exper-
imental and model results. The kinetic model, due to its multidimensionality, is ﬁtted to experimental data using a genetic
algorithm. The application of a genetic algorithm for kinetic modeling of degradation of model triarylmethane dye is demon-
strated step by step. The applied catalysts have not been used for degradation of Bromocresole Green and adopted kinetic
model has not been veri ﬁed for triarylmethane dye previously. Also, it is the ﬁrst time that a genetic algorithm has been
used for ﬁtting the adopted model.
METHODS
Material and reagents
A commercial Bromocresol Green triarylmethane dye ( Figure 1 ) was used in the present study without further puri ﬁcation.
Solutions of H 2SO4(1 M) and NaOH (1 M) were used. FeSO 4·7H 2O, MnSO 4·4H 2O, CoSO 4·7H 2O, NiSO 4·7H 2O,
Ce2(SO 4)3·8H 2O were used as catalysts and Na 2SO4·10 H 2O was used to make supporting electrolyte. All reagents were
pure for analysis (producer: POCH).
Electrochemical apparatus
The electrochemical apparatus used in this study was the same as in the Matyszczak et al. (2020a) investigation. A potentio-
stat Model EP 20, graphite roller cathode, platinum plate anode, pH-meter (CP-505, Elmetron), pH electrode (ERH-13,
Hydromet), and saturated calomel electrode (RU-10, Hydromet) were used.
Procedure for the electro-Fenton process
The experimental setup ( Figure 2 ) and procedure for the electro-Fenton process were adopted from the Matyszczak et al.
(2020a) study.
Monitoring of oxidation reaction
To monitor the degradation of Bromocresol Green in aqueous solution by the electro-Fenton oxidation a procedure from the
Matyszczak et al. (2020a) study was applied. It included recording the absorbance spectra, making its derivative and construc-
tion of a calibration curve. See Figures S1 –S3 in supplemental materials.

The kinetic model
In this study we use a simpli ﬁed and universal kinetic model proposed previously by Matyszczak et al. (2020a) ). We will recall
and shortly describe it for clarity. This model views the whole electro-Fenton process as the interplay of ﬁve reactions:
O2þ2Hþþ2e/C0!H2O2 (6)
MnþþH2O2þHþ!M(nþ1)þþH2OþOH/C1(7)
M(nþ1)þþe/C0!Mnþ(8)
Bromocresol Green þXO H/C1!! CO 2þH2O (9)
2H2O!4HþþO2þ4e/C0(10)
The symbol of the catalyst is denoted by M (in this study: Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Ce) and its charge is denoted by n. X is the number
of hydroxyl radicals needed to break down one molecule of dye. It does not have to be integer value, because the break down of
a molecule of Bromocresol Green can occur in many ways as this molecule is big ( Figure 1 ) and has many sides (e.g. carbon
atoms) which hydroxyl radical may attack, this contributes to many possible detailed pathways of degradation of molecules ofthis pollutant.
Based on reactions in the model and assumptions underlying it, following differential equations the rates of changes in the
domain of time of different chemicals during the electro-Fenton process were expressed:

on 06 December 2021Kinetic constants of reactions (7) and (8), k 7and k 8, together with X are parameters of this model.
SeeMatyszczak et al. (2020a) for detailed derivation and justi ﬁcation of this kinetic model.
Genetic algorithm
Toﬁt the parameters of the kinetic model to experimental data we used the genetic algorithm. As a global optimization method
it is ef ﬁcient for multidimensional problems ( Vikhar (2017) ). Our problem is three-dimensional because there are three par-
ameters in the model. Compared to local optimization methods (such as: simplex method, interior point, iterative least
squares etc.), a genetic algorithm is less likely to ﬁnd the local minima and is far more independent of initial guess of parameters
values (i.e. starting point). At the same time, it shares the desirable properties of local methods due to usage of the informationcollected in the process of sampling of the parameter space. It merges the advantages of both fully local and fully random
(e.g. Monte Carlo) optimization methods ( Gallagher & Sambridge (1994) ,Mirjalili et al. (2019) ,Katoch et al. (2021) ).
During the action of the genetic algorithm the solutions are referred to as ‘genotypes ’. In each generation there is a certain
number of genotypes characterized by their quality as a solution to the problem. Each next generation is formed from pre-vious generation using operations of reproduction, mutations, and crossing-over. The probability of passing of a certain
genotype to the next generation is proportional to its quality. Additionally, during the action of an elitist genetic algorithm,
a pre-established number of the best genotypes (referred to as ‘elites ’) is passed to the next generation without any modi ﬁ-
cations. After meeting the desired termination conditions the algorithm stops.
In this study we used Python 3 library ‘geneticalgorithm ’(version 1.0.1) as a implementation of genetic algorithms, simul-
taneously applying the default setup for the genetic algorithm: population size was 100, no boundaries were set for numberof iterations, probability of mutation was 0.1, probability of crossing-over was 0.5, portion of members from previous generation
passed to the next generation was 0.3, number of elites in each generation was 1. To solve the system of ordinary differential
equations we used Python 3 library ‘scipy ’(version 1.5.2) with method ‘odeint ’from module ‘integrate ’exploiting ‘lsoda ’algor-
ithm with relative error tolerances 10
/C06. The objective function for the genetic algorithm was de ﬁned by following equation:
f(x)¼X
t((xm,t/C0xe,t)2) (11)
where:
xm,t –value determined at moment in time ‘t’obtained by solving the set of differential equations
xe,t–experimental value at moment in time ‘t’
t–time.
The values of parameters were bound to certain ranges. At the start, regions for speci ﬁc parameters were the same for each
catalyst:
k7–min: 500; max: 600000
k8–min: 0; max: 5
X–min: 0; max: 50
This allowed us to obtain approximate values for each parameter and then the boundaries for their values were narrowed
(Table 1 ). For each catalyst, the algorithm was run ﬁve times and the results differed slightly in values of parameters and objec-
tive function due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm. Each time for the best result (in terms of value of objective
function) was selected.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Concentrations of Bromocresol Green divided by respective concentrations at the start of reaction are shown on Figure 3 .
For most reactions the initial current was about 6.6 mA. After the start of the reaction, the current momentarilly decreased
and then it returned to near initial value and remained almost constant for most reactions.
The ef ﬁciencies of degradation of Bromocresol Green in the electro-Fenton process with different catalysts after 110 min-
utes may be easily calculated based on normalized concentrations. A comparison of the study catalysts is presented inFigure 4 .Water Science & Technology Vol 84 No 10-11, 3231

elitist genetic algorithm (i.e. the value of objective function is non-increasing).
Parameters of the adopted model for each investigated catalyst were ﬁtted by minimizing the difference between the exper-
imental data and the numerical solution of the system of differential equations. Initial current of 6.6 mA value is taken asTable 1 |The detailed and ﬁnal boundaries for each parameter

on 06 December 2021current of cathodic generation of H 2O2. It is the only process that can occur on this electrode at beginning of the reaction.
Due to the continuous ﬂow of oxygen through the reaction mixture, the rate of the generation of hydrogen peroxide at the
cathode is assumed to be constant during the whole process. The value of this rate determined under such conditions is
in qualitative agreement with value found previously at pH ¼3.0 by Qiuet al. (2015) (4.27 · 10/C08Ms/C01at pH ¼2.5 in this
study versus 5.9 · 10/C09Ms/C01at pH ¼3.0). For reactions involving Co2þ,C e3þ,N i2þand Mn2þcations it was found that
the mean number of hydroxyl radicals needed to destroy one molecule of Bromocresol Green is much lesser than the
value of that same parameter for reaction with Fe2þ. A summary of ﬁtted values of parameters of the kinetic model, as
well as the objective function values for the investigated catalysts is shown in Table 2 .
Plots of experimental data with comparison with data simulated numerically applying the adopted kinetic model and using
values of parameters determined by the genetic algorithm are presented in Figure 6 .
Taking exactly the same initial concentration of Bromocresol Green (3·10/C05mol/L) across reactions with different cata-
lysts, we simulated the ef ﬁciencies of degradation for each used catalyst. The concentration of catalysts used in numerical
simulations was 1.5·10/C04mol/L. The results are presented in Figure 7 .
Despite the simpli ﬁed nature of the adopted kinetic model results obtained by numerical solution of the system of model
differential equations are overall in very good agreement with experimental data, as presented in Figure 6 . Mean number of
hydroxyl radicals OH ·needed to destroy one molecule of Bromocresol Green is determined to be in the range 6.30 –8.05 for
catalysts: Co2þ,C e3þ,N i2þand Mn2þand 18.99 ( ≈19) for Fe2þcatalyst. The molecule of Bromocresol Green has three ben-
zene rings and four atoms of bromine. Thus the found values of X parameter look reasonable. It seems that Fe2þcations in
some way protect the molecule of Bromocresol Green from destruction by hydroxyl radicals in comparison with other studied
catalysts because of the much larger value of the X parameter. Moreover Figure 6 shows that the model ﬁts various exper-
imental data across different catalysts. For cations Fe2þ,C e3þand Mn2þtheﬁtness is good over the whole range of time.
For Co2þand Ni2þcatalysts, the kinetic model best ﬁts experimental data at the beginning and the end of the reaction.

on 06 December 2021This led to a conclusion that electro-Fenton process with cations Co2þand Ni2þas catalysts may have more complicated
mechanisms in comparison with cases of remaining cations. It should be emphasized that the genetic algorithm proved to
be capable of ef ﬁcient ﬁtting of the model to the experimental data.
It was shown that all alternative catalysts used in this study improved the performance of the electro-Fenton process in
comparison to the Fe2þcatalyst ( Figure 4 ). The model study additionally supports this conclusion ( Figure 7 ). Both model
and experimental data showed that the best enhancement takes place when using Co2þcations as the catalyst. Cations
Ni2þ,C e3þand Mn2þgave approximately the same degradation ef ﬁciency for Bromocresol Green. Previously, George
et al. (2014) showed that Ni2þand Mn2þcations did not improve the performance of the electro-Fenton process during
salicylic acid degradation, while for Metanil Yellow Matyszczak et al. (2020a) observed an increase in ef ﬁciency only for
Ni2þand Co2þcations in comparison to Fe2þcations (amongst the same applied catalysts as in this study). Bromocresol
Green, salicylic acid, and Metanil Yellow represent three distinct types of organic molecules –triarylmethane dye, aromatic
hydrocarboxylic acid, and azo dye, respectively. It seems that the interaction of the catalyst ’s cation with pollutant com-
pounds may be different across different pollutant molecules and is crucial for the overall ef ﬁciency of the electro-Fenton
process. A catalyst that is good for breaking down one pollutant does not need to be effective for another pollutant.
CONCLUSIONS
In the removal of Bromocresol Green from aqueous solution by the electro-Fenton process it is possible to enhance the per-
formance of whole process by substituting Fe2þcatalyst cations with Co2þ,N i2þ,C e3þand Mn2þcations. It was found that
Co2þcatalyst cations are the best to increase the performance of degradation of Bromocresol Green in the electro-Fenton
process. Both experimental and model results con ﬁrmed this ﬁnding.
The adopted kinetic model is in very good agreement with the experimental model and it proved its utility for triarylmeth-
ane dye. Moreover, the genetic algorithm turned out to be ef ﬁcient in ﬁtting the multidimensional kinetic model to the
experimental data. Mathematical modeling revealed that Fe2þcations protected the molecule of Bromocresol Green from
being broken down by hydroxyl radicals (greater value of X parameter) in contrast to other investigated catalysts. Further-
more, comparison of model and experimental data for ﬁve different catalysts suggested the existence of differences in
interactions of cations with dye molecules during the electro-Fenton process.
