Abstract: Laccases have attracted a great deal of interest because of their remarkable ability for the
degradation of synthetic dyes present in wastewaters. New laccase producing sources with robust
operational and functional properties are being continuously explored. In this work, the potential
for the decolorization and detoxiÔ¨Åcation of synthetic dyes was evaluated in two Mexican strains of
the genus Trametes . The decolorization capacity of Trametes maxima LE130 and Trametes sp. LA1 was
tested in solid and liquid media. The phytotoxicity of the degradation products was determined using
Raphanus sativus and Pisum sativum seeds. In solid media, both strains showed a higher decolorization
capacity ( p0.05) than Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 24725, which is known to be very e cient in
lignin and dye-degradation. They produced laccase as the main ligninolytic enzyme; T. maxima LE130
secreted a single isoform of 43.9 kDa, while Trametes sp. LA1 produced three isoforms of 67.3, 58.6 and
52.7 kDa, respectively. Trametes sp. LA1 culture Ô¨Çuids were capable of decolorizing and detoxifying
chemically diverse dyes (anthraquinonic dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R, azoic Reactive Black 5 and
triphenylmethane Crystal Violet) without the addition of redox mediators. Therefore, this could be
considered as a new laccase source which could be potentially competitive in the bioremediation of
dye-containing wastewaters.

1. Introduction
Synthetic dyes are used globally in numerous industries, such as in the textile, paper printing, food,
pharmaceutical, leather and cosmetics industries. They produce large amounts of colored liquid wastes
containing toxic chemicals, some of which are non-biodegradable and carcinogenic and pose a major
threat to the environment and human health [ 1]. Due to their synthetic origin and complex aromatic
molecular structures, their treatment is often expensive and ine cient. To date, there is no highly
eective technique which is capable of the complete removal of both the color and the toxic properties
of the dyes released into the environment [ 1]. Microbial dye detoxiÔ¨Åcation is promising because of its
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 4610; doi:10.3390 /ijerph16234610 www.mdpi.com /journal /ijerphInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 4610 2 of 13
low-cost and relative ease of technological development. Nevertheless, azo compounds are susceptible
of forming more hazardous products such as aromatic amines after being reduced or decolorized
by bacterial azoreductases [ 2]. The role of fungi and their enzymes and their potential use in the
degradation and detoxiÔ¨Åcation of dyes has been well reported and recognized [ 3]. The most widely
used of these are white rot fungi. Their nonspeciÔ¨Åc lignin-degrading systems‚Äîmainly composed of
laccase, and peroxidases such as Mn-peroxidase (MnP) and lignin-peroxidase (LiP)‚Äîdegrade dyes by
oxidation [ 4,5]. The relative contribution of di erent enzymes in fungal cultures to decolorization is not
yet completely understood [ 6]. As the enzymatic system secreted by basidiomycetes depends even on
the strain and culture conditions, more white-rot fungi need to be screened for their ability to degrade
dyes [ 7]. Laccases (benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductases, EC 1.10.3.2) are considered ideal ‚Äúgreen
catalysts‚Äù as they do not require hydrogen peroxide for their oxidation reaction and use molecular
oxygen as an electron acceptor, generating water. Among them, high-redox potential laccases, which
may oxidize a wider range of substrates including those reported for peroxidases, are very attractive
for biotechnological purposes [ 8]. A lower redox potential (E) of the substrate and /or a higher Eof
laccase normally results in a higher rate of substrate oxidation, and a linear correlation between the
percentage of decolorization of each dye and the respective redox potential was found [ 9]. Recently,
there has been growing interest in studying new fungal laccase sources, with the expectation of Ô¨Ånding
enzymes with novel properties or which are very robust for application in dye decolorization [ 10‚Äì12].
One of the limitations of the large-scale application of the enzyme is the lack of a capacity to produce
large volumes of highly active enzyme. These problems can be solved with the use of recombinant
organisms or with screening for natural hyper secretory strains [ 13]. The information available in
the literature regarding the detoxiÔ¨Åcation of textile e uents with laccases is scarce, and no strict
correlation has been found between decolorization and detoxiÔ¨Åcation [ 10,14‚Äì16]. The identiÔ¨Åcation of
the metabolites produced during the decolorization and /or biodegradation of a certain dye, as well as
the evaluation of their toxicity, is an essential step for the eventual application of a laccase, assuring the
safety of the treated e uents [3].
Mexico is considered to be one of the most mega-diverse countries of the world; it hosts more
than 10% of the world‚Äôs biological diversity [ 17]. In Mexico, it is estimated that 200,000 fungal species
occur, and only about 5% have been studied [ 18], indicating a lack of knowledge about this group of
microorganisms and highlighting the necessity of performing further investigations. They represent
an important resource from the technological point of view because they can be used in a broad variety
of industrial processes. A screening for thermo-tolerant ligninolytic fungi with laccase, lipase and
protease activity, isolated in the large area of forests known as the Huasteca Hidalguense in the state of
Hidalgo (Mexico), was conducted by Cruz-Ramirez et al. [ 19]. Guti √©rrez-Soto et al. [ 20] explored the
lignocellulolytic potential of 74 strains isolated in northeastern Mexico. Several species of the genus
Trametes (Aphyllophorales, Polyporaceae) are considered as good laccase producers (i.e., Trametes
versicolor ,Trametes hirsuta and Trametes trogii ) [21]. In this work, the potential for the decolorization and
detoxiÔ¨Åcation of synthetic dyes was evaluated in two Mexican strains of the genus Trametes .
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Fungal Strains and Culture Conditions
Trametes maxima LE130 and Trametes sp. LA1 were provided by the culture collection of the
Laboratory of Enzymology, Biology Department from the UANL (Nuevo Le √≥n Autonomous University).
Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 24,725 was used for comparison. All strains were conserved in
YMGA (glucose 4 g L 1, malt extract 10 g L 1, yeast extract 4 g L 1and agar 15 g L 1) slants at 4C
with periodic subcultures every three months. The growth media consisted of liquid Bran Flakes
medium (BF) (2% (w /v) Kellogg‚ÄôsBran Flakes) in 60 mM potassium phosphate bu er pH 6.0 [ 22] and
the rich medium for Basidiomycota (BRM) reported by Bezalel et al. [ 23]. Additionally, the e ects of
MnSO 4(0.1 mM), FeSO 4(0.1 mM), CuSO 4(0.35 mM) and ethanol (3%) were evaluated as inducers ofInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 4610 3 of 13
MnP , LiP and laccase activity, respectively [ 7,24,25]. Erlenmeyer Ô¨Çasks (500 mL) containing 200 mL of
growth media were inoculated with 10 mm diameter plugs cut out from the margin of a 7-day-old
colony growing on PDA media and incubated statically at 28C for 20 days. The Ô¨Ånal pH of all media
was adjusted to 6.0. Cultures were harvested at proper intervals (every two days), and 2 mL aliquots
of the supernatant were collected aseptically and used as enzyme sources.
2.2. Enzymatic Assays
Laccase activity was determined by following the oxidation of 2,6 dimethoxyphenol (DMP) at
468 nm ("468(molar extinction coe cient) =49,600 M 1cm 1) [26]. MnP was measured at 270 nm
("270=11,590 M 1cm 1) by the formation of Mn3+malonate complexes according to Wariishi et al. [ 27].
LiP was measured with veratryl alcohol by following the formation of veratraldehyde at 310 nm
("310=9300 M 1cm 1) [28]. Enzymatic activities were expressed in units (U) deÔ¨Åned as the amount of
enzyme required to produce 1 mol of product. Enzymatic reactions were carried out at 25C and pH
3.5 and evaluated in a UV-Vis 1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu)).
2.3. Solid-Plate Dye Decolorization
All the strains were inoculated on agar plates in BF medium supplemented with 200 ppm of
each of the dyes evaluated (depicted in Table 1). Inoculum consisted of a 50 mm agar disc of a 5
days old culture grown on YMGA. Non-inoculated plates served as controls for abiotic decolorization.
Each fungus was tested in three independent experiments on all plates. The plates were incubated
at 28C for 30 days. Growth was followed by measuring the radial extension of the mycelium. A
decolorized zone appeared when the fungus degraded the dye. Daily measurements of the colonies
and the decolorized zones (if any) were taken for each strain. Decolorization index (DI) was calculated
as the ratio between the decolorized zone and colony diameter.

treatments ( p ‚â§ 0.05). 
3.2. Production of Ligninolytic Enzymes in Liquid Media  
Among the ligninolytic enzymes evaluated, only  laccase activity was detected in the culture 
fluids of both strains  in all the media assayed. The highest titers were quantified in medium BRM 
supplemented with 0.1 mM MnSO 4, 0.1 mM FeSO 4, 0.35 mM CuSO 4 and 3% ethanol (Figure 1). 
Trametes  sp LA1 produced 80 U L‚àí1 at day 18, while T. maxima  LE130 produced 35 U L‚àí1 at day 12. 
 
2.4. Decolorization in Liquid Medium
Decolorization was investigated in a batch system with BRM medium by adding 200 ppm of
either the anthraquinonic dye Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR), the azoic Reactive Black 5 (RB5) or
the triphenylmethane type Crystal Violet (CV) to 18 day cultures of the evaluated fungi, incubated at
28C and 200 rpm. The absorption spectra were measured in the range 200‚Äì800 nm at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and
24 h. Color reduction was followed spectrophotometrically, and decolorizing activity was calculated
from the decrease in absorption of the peak maximum for each dye (592 for RBBR, 597 for RB5, and 588
for CV). Afterwards, the supernatants were collected by Ô¨Åltration and employed for toxicity assays.
The dye adsorbed to the mycelium was desorbed with ethanol: water (1:1), and its concentration was
calculated in the same way as the percentage of decolorization. For this, the cultures were Ô¨Åltered
on Whatman No. 1 paper, and the recovered mycelium was washed with the mentioned dilution
of ethanol.
2.5. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (P AGE) and Activity Staining of Gels
Ligninolytic enzymes and their involvement in dye decolorization were assessed by Sodium
Dodecyl Suphate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the crude extracts [ 29]. Separation
was carried out on vertical polyacrylamide slab gels. Electrophoresis was performed on 12%
polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE). The bu er solution for the separating
gel was 1.5 mM (pH 8.8). Twenty-Ô¨Åve g of protein culture Ô¨Åltrates from di erent incubation days were
loaded onto the gel and electrophoresed with Tris /Glycine bu er (pH 8.3) at 100 V . Proteins separated
in the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, and their molecular mass was estimated with
Precision Plus Protein ¬óKaleidoscope ¬óPrestained Protein Standards (BioRad, Louisville, Kentucky,
USA). The zymograms were revealed with DMP as cofactors for LiP (H 2O2) and MnP (H 2O2and Mn+2)Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 4610 5 of 13
activities, respectively. Afterwards, the gel was Ô¨Åxed for 15 min in 10 (v /v) acetic acid and 40 (v /v)
methanol, and then soaked in 200 mM acetate bu er (pH 3.5) containing 2 mM /mL of DMP . Protein
bands exhibiting laccase activity were stained orange with DMP within 10 min. The anthraquinonic
dyes RBBR and Acid Green 27 (AG27) were utilized for the inverse zymograms. The gels were
immersed in 200 mM sodium acetate (pH 3.5), with 1 mL 2% AG27 or RBBR. They were shaken gently
for 1 h, until evidence of clearing bands appeared.
2.6. Phytotoxicity Bioassay
The phytotoxicity of the dyes and their derivates were determined using Raphanus sativus var.
Champion and Pisum sativum var. Lincoln seeds (IMAISA S.A., Nuevo Le √≥n, M√©xico). They were
incubated for 5 days at 25C with either (a) control (water); (b) a fresh solution of the dye (200 ppm) or
(c) the dye solution treated for 24 h with each fungus. Ten seeds were evaluated in each Petri dish.
Every treatment was carried out in triplicate.
The germination percentage was calculated considering the visible appearance of the radicle [ 30].
The damage in the radicle ( Rd) was calculated according to Equation (1):
(1):Rd=Radicle length control  Radicle length test
Radicle length control100 (1)
Dye detoxiÔ¨Åcation was estimated using the formula of Sobrero and Ronco [31]:
Detoxi f ication =(%T)(100)
(%C)(2)
where %T and %C are respectively, the percentages of inhibition on germination or the damage of the
radicle in the treated samples and in the control.
Lethal or sub-lethal damage was determined in the seeds that did not germinate. These seeds
were subjected to a test of viability [ 32]. Seeds that did not germinate were placed in Petri dishes
with Whatman paper, and then saturated with 4 mL 1distilled water. The plates were incubated at
252C, for a period of 4 and 5 days. The amount of seeds that germinated was documented, thus
conÔ¨Årming the viability and determining the type of e ect the treatments and controls had on the seeds.
In those that did not germinate when exposed to the treatments and those in which, when subjected to
the simple germination test, the protrusion of the seed by the radicle was observed, sub-lethal damage
was considered to have occurred.
2.7. Statistical Analysis
Data were subjected to ANOVA using the SPSS Statistics 10.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) software
program. Data of the analytical determinations are the average of the results of three replications. The
signiÔ¨Åcant di erences between treatments were compared by Tukey‚Äôs test at a 5% level of probability.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Solid-Plate Dye Decolorization
The broad-spectrum decolorization e ciency of the isolates was evaluated using chemically
dierent dyes representative of the most used dyes (Table 1). Poly R-478, characterized by a chemical
complexity similar to lignin compounds, allows the assessment of the fungal capability of degrading
lignin and aromatic molecules [ 33], while Azure B was employed to detect LiP activity [ 34]. The results
obtained are depicted in Table 2. Trametes sp. LA1 displayed the best results in Poly R-478 while T.
maxima LE130 performed best in Azure B (respectively, DI =0.35 and 0.64 at day 5 of cultivation).
Under the conditions assayed, P . chrysosporium ATCC 24,725 was reported as an e cient LiP and dye
decolorizing strain [ 35], which only partially decolorized Azure B and Acid Orange (OII) plates afterInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 4610 6 of 13
15 days (Table 2) and Poly R-478 after 30 days (data not shown). No statistically signiÔ¨Åcant di erences
were registered among Trametes sp. LA1 DI of Direct Black (DB), OII, RB5 and RBBR. The best DI
values were attained with CV . T.maxima LE130 rendered the highest DI for all the dyes evaluated.
The di erent DI values reÔ¨Çect the di erent capacities of the fungal cultures to remove dyes with
diverse chemical structures. Small structural di erences between the dyes could signiÔ¨Åcantly a ect
their decolorization. This might be due to di erences in electron distribution, charge density or steric
factors [36].

The absence of noticeable levels of LiP and MnP was conÔ¨Årmed by SDS-PAGE gels, revealed
by 2,6-DMP and the cofactors required for each enzyme (H 2O2and H 2O2+Mn+2, respectively).
Laccase was the only activity detected in these gels (Figure 2). In Trametes species, laccases are the
major enzymes, but peroxidases are also secreted during dye decolorization [7]. Nevertheless, under
the conditions assayed in this work, peroxidase activity was not detected. In both strains assayed,
the laccase isoenzymatic proÔ¨Åle did not vary between days 14 and 20. T. maxima LE130 produced
a single laccase isoform (Lac Tm), with a molecular weight of 43.9 kDa. Trametes sp LA1 produced
three isoforms (Lac TspI, Lac TspII, Lac TspIII), with molecular weights of, respectively, 67.3, 58.6 and
52.7 kDa. The molecular masses reported in this study are in the range observed for laccases isolated
from other white-rot fungi; usually, molecular masses of fungal laccases range from 30 to 300 kDa [ 37].
Laccase decolorizing activity was assayed by inverse zymograms, as revealed with the dyes AG27 and
RBBR (Figure 2). In T. maxima LE130 zymograms stained with AG27 (Figure 2A), a precipitate was
observed coincident with the laccase activity band, possibly resulting from dye polymerization. The
capacity of phenoloxidases to polymerize phenols is widely documented (for both free and immobilized
laccase) [ 38].T. maxima LE130 laccase activity did not show potential for decolorizing RBBR. RBBR
decolorization by T. maxima LE130 laccase might require the presence of redox mediators. The potential
of synthetic dye decolorization by puriÔ¨Åed laccases has been described in several species; however,
most dyes are only transformed in the presence of redox mediators [ 39]. Natural laccase mediators [ 40]
may be present in the extracellular Ô¨Çuids of the fungus, which proved capable of decolorizing 55%
of this dye after 24 h (Table 3). All laccase isoforms from Trametes sp. LA1 showed decolorizing
activity on AG27 (Figure 2B), but only Lac TspIII was capable of decolorizing RBBR. The isozymes
may have di erent substrate a nity, which may a ect their decolorization potential [ 41]. Finding
laccase as the principal activity responsible for decolorization is consistent with previous reports with
Trametes hispida [42] and T. hirsuta [26]. However, further studies with pure enzymes are necessary to
corroborate this conclusively.

3.3. Decolorization of Dyes by Liquid Cultures
Both strains assayed showed signiÔ¨Åcant di erences ( p0.05) in their ability to decolorize dyes
with diverse chemical structures. After 24 h, the best results were obtained by T. maxima LE130 with the
azo dye RB5 (61% decolorization), while the triarylmethane CV was more resistant to biodegradation
(Table 3). However, Trametes sp. LA1 could decolorize CV more e ectively ( p0.05) (approximately
80%). The role of adsorption on the fungal mycelium in dye decolorization was minimal. The dyes were
rapidly removed from the medium because of physical adsorption, but they were later eliminated from
both the solution and the surface of the mats because of the enzymatic degradation. At the end of the
experiment, sorption accounted for less than 5%. Aretxaga et al. [ 43] as well as Levin et al. [ 44] obtained
similar results when they evaluated dye decolorization by T. versicolor . Sorption was responsible for
less than 3% of azo and triphenylmethane dye removal by ligninolytic (dye-decolorizing) cultures of
Pycnoporus sanguineus [45].
3.4. Phytotoxicity Assays
The phytotoxicity of CV , RBBR and RB5 before and after treatment with T.maxima LE130 and
Trametes sp. LA1 cultures was assessed by the analysis of their e ects on seed germination, radicle
length and damage, using R. sativus (Table 4) and P . sativum seeds (Table 5). CV was the only dye which
altered R. sativus germination. However, all the dyes assayed caused severe damages to the radicle
(approximately 90%). Treated dyes with T. maxima LE130 were more toxic than the untreated ones
(showing signiÔ¨Åcant di erences not only in seed germination percentages but also in radicle length).
Treatment with Trametes sp. LA1 reduced the toxicity of the triphenylmethane dye CV; treated dyes did
not a ect the germination of these seeds, but also markedly diminished radicle damage (55% decrease)
and growth inhibition in comparison with the untreated dyes. Laccase activity might be involved in
decolorization and detoxiÔ¨Åcation processes, considering that Trametes sp. LA1 laccase titers in cultures
applied in decolorization (80 U L 1) were more than twice those registered in T. maxima LE130 culture
Ô¨Çuids, and concomitantly, Trametes sp. LA1 was capable of decolorizing approximately 80% of 200 ppmInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 4610 9 of 13
CV , while T. maxima LE130 cultures only decolorized 40% of this dye (Figure 1, Table 3). Germination
percentages did not vary signiÔ¨Åcantly between RB5-untreated and Trametes sp. LA1-treated samples,
but radicle damage decreased (8%) and length increased with Trametes sp. LA1 treatment. On the
contrary, Trametes sp. LA1-treated RBBR slightly inhibited growth germination and decreased root
elongation. The e ects varied when assaying P . sativum seeds, but CV was the only dye that a ected
both radicle length and damage. Treated dyes with T. maxima LE130 were more toxic than the untreated
ones (the root lengths of selected plants decreased with all the treated dyes and germination diminished
when applying T. maxima LE130-treated CV). However, CV metabolites present after with Trametes sp.
LA1-treatment did not a ect seed germination, although the negative e ects of CV on root elongation
and damage persisted. P . sativum root elongation was neither a ected by RBBR and RB5 nor by the
metabolites which resulted after treatment. Radicle damage was also not observed. The abiotic controls
as well as the three dyes treated with T. maxima LE130 and Trametes sp. LA1-treated RB5 and RBBR
only produced sub-lethal e ects on both seeds, as they conserved their germination capacity.

Damage was registered in R. sativus  cotyledons as a result of dye exposition (Figure 3A) and in 
radicle calyptra of P. sativum  seeds (Figure 3B). Treatment with Trametes  LA1 diminished the 
damage observed (Figure 3C).

seedling exposed to CV treated with Trametes sp LA1 (LA1-treated dye). 
In overview, the phytotoxicity of the azoic dye RB5 and the triphenylmethane CV treated with 
Trametes  sp. LA1 decreased by around 15% and 45% when tested in R. sativus  seeds, while the 
toxicity of CV and the anthraquinonic dye RBBR diminished by approximately 42% and 48% when 
assayed with P. sativum  seeds (Table 6). On the contrary,  T. maxima  LE130-treated dyes were more 
toxic than the abiotic controls. RB5 toxicity decreased after treatment with Phanerochaete sordida  
laccase [46]. The laccase from Trametes pubescens  also decreased the toxicity of the azo dye Congo 
Red [47] (Si et al., 2013). The degradation of azo dyes OII and Acid Orange 6 by laccase from T. 
versicolor  was also accompanied by a decrease of phytotoxicit [10]. The triphenylmethane dye 
Malachite Green proved to be detoxified by Pleurotus florida  [48] and Fomes sclerodermeus  [49] 
laccases. However, the results ma y vary with the dye assayed; for example, Ramsay and Nguyen 
(2002) [14] treated various textile dyes with T. versicolor . After decolorization, the toxicity of the 
solutions containing Amaranth, Tropaeolin O and RB5 was unchanged and Reactive Blue 15, RBBR 
and Cibacron Brilliant Red 3G-P decreased to non- toxic levels, but Cibacron Brilliant Yellow 3B-A 
and Congo Red became very toxic.

4. Conclusions
There is currently growing interest in assessing the potential of new microorganisms for industrial
and environmental applications, including wastewater treatment. More than 70% of freshwater
resources in Mexico are a ected as a result of pollution from all sources, with 31% described as
contaminated or grossly contaminated [ 50].Trametes sp. LA1‚Äîa new, isolated strain from Mexico‚Äî
when cultivated in a low-cost medium based on bran Ô¨Çakes, produced laccase as the main ligninolytic
enzyme detected in its culture Ô¨Çuids and was capable of decolorizing and detoxifying chemically
diverse dyes, without the addition of redox mediators. The major drawback of the enzymatic treatment
is the inactivation of enzymes in the conditions normally found in textile wastewater and the high cost
of enzyme production [ 51]. Based on these results, it is suggested that Trametes sp. LA1 might be a
notable candidate for wastewater biodecolorization.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019 ,16, 4610 11 of 13
