There are two distinct pathways for disul®de form-
ation in prokaryotes. The DsbA±DsbB pathway intro-
duces disul®de bonds de novo , while the DsbC±DsbD
pathway functions to isomerize disul®des. One of thekey questions in disul®de biology is how the isomerase
pathway is kept separate from the oxidase pathway
in vivo . Cross-talk between these two systems would
be mutually destructive .To force communication
between these two systems we have selected dsbC
mutants that complement a dsbA null mutation. In
these mutants, DsbC is present as a monomer as com-pared with dimeric wild-type DsbC. Based on these
®ndings we rationally designed DsbC mutants in the
dimerization domain. All of these mutants are able torescue the dsbA null phenotype. Rescue depends on
the presence of DsbB, the native re-oxidant of DsbA,
both in vivo and in vitro. Our results suggest that
dimerization acts to protect DsbC's active sites from
DsbB-mediated oxidation. These results explain how
oxidative and reductive pathways can co-exist in theperiplasm of Escherichia coli .

Introduction
The formation of disul®de bonds is one of the key steps
during the folding of many secretory proteins; so import-ant that proteins that lack their disul®des are often rapidly
degraded. In bacteria, disul®de bond formation is
catalyzed by the Dsb proteins (for reviews see Raina andMissiakas, 1997; Rietsch and Beckwith, 1998; Debarbieux
and Beckwith, 1999). DsbA is a 21 kDa periplasmic
protein with a CXXC motif in its active site. DsbA rapidlyoxidizes cysteine residues in target proteins, thus leading
to the formation of a disul®de bond. DsbA's extreme
oxidizing power is responsible for the oxidizing nature ofthe periplasm as compared with the relatively reducingenvironment of the cell's cytosol (Wunderlich and
Glockshuber, 1993). The inner membrane protein DsbB
oxidizes DsbA ef®ciently (Bardwell et al., 1993; Guilhot
et al ., 1995). Thus, disul®de bonds ¯ow from DsbB toDsbA and then onto folding proteins. DsbB is re-oxidized
directly by ubiquinone present in the inner membrane.
Electrons ¯ow from ubiquinone via terminal cytochrome
oxidases onto oxygen. DsbB provides a link between
disul®de bond formation and electron transport(Kobayashi et al., 1997; Bader et al., 1999, 2000).
A second independent pathway acts on wrongly formed
disul®de bonds. DsbC and DsbG act to isomerize theseincorrect disul®de bonds (Rietsch et al ., 1996; Darby
et al., 1998; Bessette et al., 1999). Disul®de isomerization
involves the nucleophilic attack of a wrong disul®de bondby the reduced catalyst forming a mixed disul®de bond
between the enzyme and the target protein. The complex
resolves upon formation of a disul®de bond in the targetprotein (Gilbert, 1997). In order to attack a disul®de bond
and catalyze its rearrangement, the catalyst has to be kept
in a reduced form. This is done by an inner membrane
protein called DsbD, which uses the reducing power of
thioredoxin to reduce DsbC (Missiakas et al ., 1995;
Rietsch et al., 1996, 1997).
A very important question concerning the DsbA±DsbB
and DsbC±DsbD system is how these two pathways arekept separate. DsbA is found almost entirely in the
oxidized form in vivo , while DsbC is entirely reduced
(Joly and Swartz, 1997). This is in agreement with theirdivergent roles. Oxidases like DsbA need to be oxidized to
be active, while isomerases need to be kept reduced.
However, it begs the question of how the two systemsavoid a futile cycle. Any cross-talk between the two
pathways would make disul®de bond formation less
ef®cient, as it would lead to the oxidation of the reductivepathway and vice versa. It has been shown that DsbA
oxidizes DsbC very slowly in vitro , slow enough to
essentially eliminate cross-talk in vivo (Darby et al .,
1998). Recently, we have found that the two pathways are
also kinetically separated at the level of DsbB (Baderet al ., 2000). DsbB discriminates between DsbA and
DsbC. The re-oxidation of DsbA by DsbB was found to be
at least 500-fold faster than the re-oxidation of DsbC byDsbB, leading us to conclude that DsbB effectively
oxidizes DsbA but not DsbC.
Here we provide evidence for the molecular basis of the
separation of the oxidative and reductive pathways. We
have isolated dsbC mutants that complement a dsbA null
mutant, showing that they can actually replace dsbA
in vivo. These mutants map to DsbC's dimerization
interface and fail to form stable dimers. Based on this
result we targeted the dimerization interface for muta-
genesis, and in doing so constructed an additional four
mutants that complement the dsbA null mutation. We also
found that monomeric DsbC mutants were oxidized by
DsbB in vivo andin vitro. Monomerization of DsbC allows
it to switch allegiances and participate in the oxidativepathway.Turning a disul®de isomerase into an oxidase:

Identi®cation ofdsbC mutants that complement
dsbA
Intheperiplasm ofEscheric hiacoli,DsbA isthenetdonor
ofdisul®de bonds while DsbC function sasadisul®de
isomer asethat corrects wrongl yformed disul®de bonds
(Bard well etal.,1991; Rietsch etal.,1996). Toavoid
inactivation oftheisomeriz ation pathway bytheoxidative
pathway, thetwo must bekept isolated. Togain insight
intowhatmakeseach pathway sospeci® cforoxidatio nor
isomer ization, wedecided toconver tDsbCinto anet
donor ofdisul®de bonds; ineffect,allowing DsbC toact
like DsbA. DsbA null strains arecompletely non-motile,
while dsbA+strains aremotile (Dailey andBerg, 1993).
Based onthisphenot ype, wedevised apowerf ulgenetic

Weconclude that thefailure toform afunct ional dimer

Fig. 5.DsbB re-oxidizes monomeric DsbC invitro. DsbB's ability to
re-oxidize monomeric DsbC (H45D, ®lled circles; G49R, open circles)
wasmeasured byitsubiquinone reductas eactivity. Theassay buffer
consists of100mM sodium phosphate pH6.0,0.1% dodecyl-
maltoside, 20mMubiquinon eand1mMDsbB. Theconcentrati onof

DsbB wasplotted asquinone reductas eactivity. Reduced wild-type
DsbC served asacontrol (®lled triangles), andamuch lower

lead toinactivati onoftheoxida tivepathwa y.This isvery
similartotheproblem ofhow thecellavoids inactivat ion

hand, DsbD contains athiore doxin fold, which hastobe
protected from DsbB-media tedoxida tion. Onceagain, itis
quite surpris inghow thethioredoxi nfolds ofthevarious

mechanisms ofhow theisomer ization pathwa yoperates. It

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains andplasmid constru cts
The strains and plasmids used inthis study areshown inTable II.
Mutations were introduce dinto thedsbC gene using theStratagene
QuikChange kit.Theforward primers used arelisted inTable III.ADsbC
variant (pMB96) lacking the®rst76amino acids ofthenative protein was
constructed followi ngthe Stratagen eExsite Protocol with some
modi®cation s.Inbrief, whole plasmid pMB69 was ampli®ed byPCR
using thephosphorylat edprimers listed inTable III.The linear PCR
product was ligated invitro ,DpnIdigested andtransfo rmed into XL1-
blue. Transforma ntswere screened bythelossofaBsmIsite. Allvariants
were con®rmed bysequence analysis oftheentire dsbC gene.
Selection forDsbC mutant sthat compleme ntadsbA null
phenotype
Random mutagen esisofthedsbC gene wascarried outintheStratagene
XL-1 Red Epicurea nColi mutator strain (Stratagene, CA). PlasmidpMB69 containing wild-type dsbC was transformed into XL-1 Red.
pMB69 isderived from pBAD33a (Guzman etal.,1995), and was
obtained from G.Gergiou (University ofTexas). This strain lacks three
keyenzymes forDNA repair, which leads toa5000-fold increase inthe
mutation rate. DNA extracted from ~1500 individual colonies waspooled
andelectroporat edinto thedsbA null mutant JCB817. Mutant colonies
thatconferred adsbA+phenotype were selected bytheir ability toswim
through 0.3% agar minimal media motility plates. Transformant sfrom
each library were pooled andserially diluted in150mM NaCl. Aliquots
of100mlfrom these dilutions were added to4mlofcooling motility
medium containing 0.05% arabinose andpoured ontopofaportion of
pre-poured motility plates. Plates were incubated at37°Cuntil motile
puffs arose thatwere moving into theportion ofthemotility plates that
hadnotbeen overlaid with themutagenized library (~48 h).Motile puffs
were streaked outonto chlorampheni colplates. Plasmids from these
colonies were extracted andre-transform edintoJCB817. Forallofthese
strains, motility depended upon supplement ation ofthemedia with
arabinose, suggesting that expression ofDsbC was necessary fortheir
motility. Stabbing asingle colony onto minimal plates containing 0.3%
agar assessed themotility ofthese colonies. Theminimal media contained
0.4% glycerol, 0.2% arabinose, 0.2% ammoniu msulfate, 1mM
magnesium sulfate, 0.1% casamino acids, 2mg/ml biotin, 2mg/ml
nicotinamid e,0.2mg/ml ribo¯avin and2mg/ml thiamin.
Expression andpuri®cation ofproteins
DsbB waspuri®ed asdescribed previously (Bader etal.,1999). TheDsbC
variant G49E was puri®ed byanion exchang echromatogra phy ashas
been described previously forwild-type DsbC (Missiakas etal.,1994).
His-tagged wild-type DsbC and thevariant H45D were puri®ed over
HiTrap Chelating columns (Pharmac ia)charged with nickel according to
themanufacturer's manual .DsbA andDsbC were reduced with 10mM
dithiothreit ol(DTT); excess DTT wasremoved bygel®ltration onPD10
columns (Pharmacia). Allproteins were >95% pure after puri®cat ion.
Biochemic alassays
Invivo alkaline phosphat aseactivity wasmeasured using cells prepared
from 25mlovernight cultures grown inthesame minimal media as
described above. The OD 600foreach culture was measure danda1ml
aliquot ofeach overnight culture (1:10) was trapped with 0.1 M
iodoacetami defor20min at0°C.The cells were then washed with ice-
cold 67mMMOPS, 83mMsodium chloride, 13mMammoniu mchloride
pH7.3, supplement edwith 10mM magnesi umchloride and 10mM
iodoacetami de.The washed cells were used intheassay described
previously (San Millan etal.,1989; Boyd etal.,1993). Thesubstrate used
wasSigma 104(Sigma Diagnost ics,StLouis, MO).
DsbB activity was determi ned bymeasur ingitsquinone reductas e
activity at275nm.Inbrief, 20mMdecyl-ubi quinone wasincubated with
reduced DsbC H45D in100 mM sodium phosphate pH6.0, 0.1%
dodecyl-ma ltoside. Thereaction wasstarted bytheaddition ofDsbB toa
®nal concentration of1mM.Asacontrol, quinone reduction was
determined inthepresence ofwild-type DsbC. Tovisualize theredox
state ofDsbC after incubation with DsbB andubiquinon e,samples were
taken andprecipitated with 5%trichloro acetic acid (TCA). Free thiols
were modi®ed with 4-acetam ido-4 ¢-maleimidyl stilbene-2,2 ¢-disulfonic
acid (AMS) essentially asdescribe dbefore (Kobayashi etal.,1997).
Analytical gel®ltration ofDsbC variants wasperformed onSephadex
200(Pharmacia) in10mM HEPES pH7.5and300mM NaCl. Wild-type
DsbC served asacontrol. Thepresence oftheHistagdidnotaffect the
retention time onthiscolumn ascompared with theprotein withou taHis
tag.TheSigma lowmolecula rweight gel®ltration standar dwasused to
generate astandar dcurve inorder toobtain apparent molecular weights
forDsbC variants.Table II.Strains andplasmids
