 2 Abstract  19 
Early  diverging lineages such as trypanosomes can provide clues to the evolution of s exual 20 
reproduction in eukaryotes . In Trypanosoma  brucei , the pathogen that cause s Human African 21 
Trypanosomiasis,  sexual reproduction occurs  in the salivary glands  of the insect host , but 22 
analysis of the molecular signatures  that define the se sexual forms  is complicated because 23 
they mingle with more numerous, mitotically -dividing developmental stages. We used single - 24 
cell RNA -sequencing (scRNAseq) to profile  388 indi vidual trypanosomes from  midgut, 25 
proventriculus, and salivary glands  of infected tsetse flies  allowing us to  identif y tissue -specific 26 
cell types . Further investigation of salivary gland parasite transcriptomes revealed  fine-scale 27 
changes in gene expression  over a developmental progression  from putative sexual forms 28 
through  metacyclics expressing variant surface glycoprotein genes . The cluster of cells 29 
potentially containing sexual forms was characterized by high level transcription of  the gamete 30 
fusion protein  HAP2 , together with  an array of surface proteins and several genes of unknown  31 
function. We linked  these expression patterns to  distinct  morphological forms using 32 
immunofluorescence assays and reporter gene expression to demonstra te that  the 33 
kinetoplastid -conserved gene Tb927.10.12080  is exclusively expressed at high levels by 34 
meiotic intermediates and gametes. We speculate that this protein, currently of unknown 35 
function, plays a role in gamete formation and/or fusion . 36

 3 Introduction  41 
The African tsetse -transmitted trypanosomes are single -celled parasites that cause human 42 
and animal diseases, which are a heavy burden for many countries in sub-Saharan  Africa. 43 
These trypanosomes survive in  both the tsetse and mammalian host by taking on d istinct 44 
morphological forms that suit the diverse metabolic  and immune  environments they encounter  45 
[1]. When blood infected with Trypanosoma  brucei  is imbibed by the  tsetse  fly (genus 46 
Glossina), trypanosome blood stream  forms (BSF) rapidly  change their transcriptional profile, 47 
including switching off  Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG)  transcription and upregulating 48 
expression of other surface proteins such as procyclins  [2,3] They also switch their metabolism 49 
from dependence on glucose processed via glycolysis in the glycosome to exploitation of 50 
amino acids such as proline via the mitochondrial TCA cycle  [4]. Trypanosomes then multiply 51 
as procyclics in the fly midgut before migrating anteriorly, first colonising the proventriculus or 52 
cardia, the valve between the foregut and anterior midgut, and then the paired salivary glands 53 
(Figure 1A ) [5,6]. Here trypanosomes attach and proliferate as epimastigotes characterised 54 
by BARP  surface proteins [7], before final differentiation into infective metacyclic s that are 55 
inoculated into a new host via the saliva.  56 
 57 
Additionally, the  salivary glands  are the location of the non -obligatory sexual cycle of T. brucei , 58 
which involves meiosis and the production of haploid gametes  [8,9]. As trypanosomes are 59 
early diverging eukaryote s, their sexual processes are of particular interest becaus e the y 60 
provide  insights into the evolution of sexual reproduction and meiosis . Although the 61 
morphologies of the meiotic division stages and gametes have been described [8–10], little is 62 
known about the transcriptional dynamics  that characterise the  sexual stages  because these 63 
cells are a minority of the heterogenous cell population in the salivary glands . Sexual stages 64 
are found during th e early phase  of establishmen t of salivary gland infection , with numbers 65 
peaking about three weeks after fly infection  [8,9]. The sexual cycle  appears to be a sideshow 66 
in the normal mitotic developmental program, as it occurs in clonal trypanosome lines and 67 
does not need to be triggered by external factors such as the presence of another strain.  68 
 69 
Single -cell RNAseq opens the door to study heterogenous populations of single -celled 70 
parasites by delineating expression patterns of individual  cells allowing us to understand 71 
continuous developmental processes , cell-type specific patterns of co -expression  and bet - 72 
hedging  strategies  [11–17]. Recent  studi es have profiled T. brucei  populations  using  single - 73 
cell droplet -based approaches  from BSF culture  to profile the development of stumpy forms 74 
[18] as well as  in vivo  salivary gland parasites in order to identify a potential vaccine candidate  75 
among mature metacyclics  [19] and the dynamics of VSG  expression in the developing 76 
metacyclic parasites  [20]. These studies complement the previous bulk transcriptomic studies  77 
in T. brucei  that identified the major changes in transcriptional patterns over time and 78 
metacyclic development using either whole infected salivary glands or in vitro -derived 79 
metacyclics from the R BP 6-inducible system [21–28]. Although these studies have been 80 
essential to our understanding of the dynamics of gene expression in T. brucei , we still lack 81 
an understanding of the molecular processing that characterize meiosis and sexual 82 
development in kinetoplastids .  83 
 84 
Here we have exploited scRNAseq  to investigate transcriptomes of the sexual stages of T. 85 
brucei  that occur transiently in the heterogeneous trypanosome population in the fly salivary 86 
glands.  We use d a modified Smart -seq2 protocol [12,13,29]  to profile  T. brucei  cells from 87 . CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

 4 different tsetse tissues ( midgut, proventriculus, salivary glands ) at different  time point s during 88 
development. We tied the observed transcriptomic profiles to specific developmental stages, 89 
validated by immunofluorescence, and  identified cell -type specific markers , which revealed 90 
the dynamics of surface protein  expression as well as a new cand idate gene that may be 91 
involved in sexual development.  92 
Results and Discussion  93 
Generation of high -quality  transcriptomes from in vitro  procyclic forms  94 
To confirm that the modified Smart -seq2 protocol produces  high-quality data for T. brucei , we 95 
initially profiled 46 single -cell transcriptomes from in vitro  procyclic forms. We found a mean 96 
of 2.6x106 mapped reads per cell and a  mean detection of 1756 genes per cell  (Figure S1A,  97 
B), which  is a greater number of genes per cell than recently pu blished data from Hutchinson 98 
et al 2021  [20] that used a droplet -based  method  on the same parasite stage (1258 genes per 99 
cell). This further support s the use of Smart -seq2 to get in depth  transcriptomes  (high - 100 
coverage  and full-length)  in a low-throughput , targeted fa shion  compared to droplet -based 101 
methods  that have fewer genes detected  but are high er throughput  [12,30] . Additionally, we 102 
observed high expression of  genes that encode  known procyclic surface antigens including 103 
GPEET  and EP1-3 [2,31]  (Figure S1C). These data support the utility of our protocol to profile 104 
single -cell expression profiles in kinetoplast ids. 105 
Transcriptomes  of fly developmental stages  106 
Having confirmed that the modified Smart -seq2 protocol would produce high -quality data from 107 
T. brucei  in vitro  procyclic forms , we profiled parasite transcriptomes isolated from diverse 108 
tsetse tissues at different timepoints, and from two T. brucei  strains as outlined in Figure 1A . 109 
After quality control (Figure S2) , we obtained a total of 388 single -cell parasite transcriptomes: 110 
78 from the midgut, 34 from the proventriculus and 276 from the salivary glands (Figure 1A).  111 
Parasites from the midgut  and proventriculus were isolated from flies infected with T. brucei  112 
strain 1738 dissected day 21 post infection ( pi); 53 parasites from the  SG were also derived 113 
from these flies. A further 62 1738 parasites from the salivary glands  were collected on day 114 
40 pi; these cells were derived from free ( spill-out from  tissue ) or attached ( enzymatically 115 
disassociated ) cell populations to capture popul ations dominated by metacyclics or attached 116 
epimastigotes and premetacyclics, respectively (Figure 1A) . A further experiment dissected 117 
on day 24 pi aimed to analyse salivary gland  parasites from an experimental cross between 118 
strains  1738 and J10; 86 cells were from single infections of 1738 (38) or J10 (48), and 75 119 
were from the experimental cross.  We additionally used two cell preservation methods in the 120 
collection of these data to allow for more flexibility in processing time. Although small 121 
differences w ere observed in the number of genes detected between preservation methods, 122 
this was confounded by timepoint, preventing us from fully understanding the impact of the 123 
preservation techniques alone ( Figure S3 ).  124 
 125 
To understand transcriptional variation  at the single -cell level  across tissues, strains, and time , 126 
we performed dimensionality reduction with all 388 cells using UMAP  (Figure 1B) . We 127 
observed that cells  grouped by their tissue of origin , with clusters representing midgut and 128 
proventri culus trypanosomes and  two groups of salivary gland  parasites that we hypothesized 129 
could represent different cell-types or  stages (Figure  1B). This idea was supported by the 130 . CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

 5 distribution of time points across the two salivary gland  groups  with 21- and 24 -day pi cells 131 
distributed throughout  the two groups , while the 40-day pi cells (squares) occupied the centre 132 
and right -hand area; the left-hand  area therefore represents early  salivary gland  133 
developmental stages , such as sexual stages, which are frequent at 21 – 24 days pi, but are 134 
relatively scarce at 40 days pi compared to epimastigotes and metacyclics (Peacock et al, 135 
2014) .  136 
 137 
We next used consensus clustering to partition the  cells into six clusters  based on the top 138 
average silhouette score in SC3  [32] (Figure 1C) . The midgut  and proventriculus  parasites  139 
each f ormed a single cluster  (clusters C1 and C2 respectively) , whereas the salivary gland  140 
cells divided into four clusters (C3 -C6). We identified 238 marker genes across the six clusters 141 
allowing us to assign potential cell types  (AUROC >  0.75, p < 0.01, Table S 1, Figure 1D) . C1 142 
and C5 had very few significant marker genes and C6 had none  (hence not included in Figure 143 
1D). This is likely due to different overall levels of transcriptional activity across the cell types  144 
as we observed fewer genes per cell fo r these clusters (Table S1) . For further 145 
characterization, w e additionally identified the top 200 genes expressed in each cluster (Table 146 
S2). Based on both the cluster markers and top genes of each cluster, we were able to assign  147 
putative cell -types.   C1 a nd C2 showed expression patterns consistent with midgut procyclics 148 
and proventricular forms , respectively , based on known marker genes and bulk transcriptomic 149 
data [21,33]  (Tabl e S2) . C1 was characterized by a single marker gene , FHc (Tb927.3.4500) , 150 
a fumarate hydratase,  which c atalyses conversion  of fum arate to malate in the TCA cycle  151 
(Figure 1)   [4,34] . FHc was also the most significant marker gene for the midgut forms when 152 
integrated with T. brucei single -cell data from [20], supporting the cell -type assignment across 153 
datasets (Figure S4, Table S3) .  C1 also express ed several genes encoding surface proteins  154 
at high levels ( EP1: Tb927.10.10260 , EP3-2: Tb927.6.520 , and EP2: Tb927.10.10250 ), as 155 
well as three Proteins Associated with Differentiation  (PAD1 : Tb927.7.5930 , PAD2 : 156 
Tb927.7.5940 , PAD7 : Tb927.7.5990 ) (Table S2) , which  are implicated as sensors of 157 
environmental stimuli and trigger differentiation  [35].  C2 had several marker genes associated 158 
with transport (e.g. amino acid transporter AATP11  and purine nucleotide transporter NT10 , 159 
Figure 1), both also highly expressed in C1 cells (Table S2) . Procyclin EP2 was identified as 160 
a marker gene for this cluster , though both EP1 and EP3 (Tb927.6.480) were also highly 161 
expressed (Table S2) .  162 
 163 
Cluster C3 comprise d day 21/24 pi early salivary gland developmental stages  (Figure 1 B, C) 164 
including potential sexual forms . Notably,  we observed  high expression of the  gamete fusion 165 
protein  HAP2  (Tb927 .10.10770) , which is known to be expressed in meiotic intermediates and 166 
gametes  (Table S1)  [10]. An analogous  cluster was also identified by [20], which showed  high 167 
expression of HAP2  and HOP1  (Tb927.10.5490 ), a meiosis -specific protein. Integration 168 
across these two datasets showed the cells from both studies clustered together at a granular 169 
level (Figure S 4, Table S 3). Other notable marker genes for this cluster were two leucine -rich 170 
repeat (LRR) protein genes  (Tb927.9.14570, Tb 927.7.7180) , with a third also highly expressed 171 
(Table S2) ; as LRRs are protein recognition motifs, this could be significant in gamete 172 
interactions. Procyclin  genes  EP1, EP3 and GPEET  (Tb927.6.510)  (Table S2)  were highly 173 
expressed, together with BARP  genes , which is the characteristic surface protein of 174 
epimastigotes [7].  175 
 176 
Several BARP  genes were the prominent marker transcripts in cluster C4 (Figure 1D) , 177 
identifying this  cluster as salivary gland  epimastigotes, consistent with previous studies 178 . CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

 6 [19,20] . The majority of the later time point (day 40 pi) cells were found in clusters C5 and C 6 179 
(Figure 1B, C ), showing that these cluster s represent the later salivary gland  developmental 180 
stages  including  mature metacyclics and/or their immediate precursors, pre - and nascent 181 
metacyclics . However, the identities of these clusters remain unclear. C5 had only three 182 
significant marker genes, two of which encode  zinc finger proteins  and one hypothetical 183 
protein , and C6 none  (Figure 1D, Table S2 ). The zinc finger protein  genes , ZC3H11  184 
(Tb927.5.810)  and ZC3H45  (Tb927.11.8470)  were  also identified as biomarkers of pre - 185 
metac yclics (Meta 1 ) in Vigneron et al 2020  [19], and ZC3H11 was also identified as a highly 186 
expressed gene in purified, culture -derived mature metacyclics  [27]. Several other highly 187 
expressed genes of mature metacyclics ([27]) were also identified in our data for either C5 or 188 
C6 (e.g. ZFP2 , HSP 110 ; Table S2). It is noteworthy that cluster C5 is predominantly J10, 189 
while cluster C6 is predominantly 1738  (Figure 1D ), and hence these clusters may also 190 
represent strain -specific rather than stage -specific expression differences.  Additionally, 191 
mature and nascent metacyclics both have VSG on the surface  [36], and it is reasonab le to 192 
suppose that pre -metacyclics already transcribe VSG s. In support of this, both previous 193 
scRNAseq studies found high levels of expression of VSG s in cells identified as pre - 194 
metacyclics (Meta 1, Vigneron et al, 2020; Pre-metacyclic, Hutchinson et al, 2021).  Here, 195 
VSG s were not identified as abundant transcripts in either C5 or C6, likely because of  poor 196 
match between  1738/J10 VSG  transcripts and the Tb927 reference genome , as VSG  197 
repertoires are strain -specific . We next endeavoured  to identify the metacyclic  VSG  repertoire 198 
of 1738 and J10, in order to confirm the cell -types of C5 and C6.  199 . CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Expression of mVSG  transcripts  211 
Mature  metacyclics can be unequivocally identified by their lack of expression of the cell 212 
surface proteins GPEET, EP and BARP, replaced by expression of a single mVSG  gene in 213 
each cell [27], but pre -metacyclics also transcribe mVSG s at high level  in [20]. To explore 214

 8 mVSG  expression in salivary gl and-derived cells here, we first needed to identify  the mVSG  215 
repertoire s of strains 1738 and J10 , which differ from those of previously published strains. 216 
We built a de novo  transcriptome assembly based on all reads from the 388 tsetse -derived 217 
cells and identified  putative  mVSG s by compari son of the resulting  ORFs to  the total VSG  218 
repertoire of each strain, previously  identified using an HMM on full -genom e Illumina sequence 219 
data [37]. These assemble d mVSG  transcripts were  then mapped to 1738 or J10 contigs to 220 
place them in a genomic context. Using this method, w e identified  11 mVSG s that were 221 
expressed in our dataset  all of which contained an  upstream mVSG  promoter  based on the 222 
consensus sequence  [38,39] . Additionally, downstream telomeric repeats were present in six 223 
of these contigs ( Figur e 2A ). Although several  ESAG s were found on the contigs, these were 224 
up- not downstream of the promotor and therefore not part of the mVSG  expression site.  The 225 
presence of the se characteristic features of mVSG  gave us further confidence that the 226 
identified  transcripts were originating from bona fide  mVSG . Interestingly, J10 and 1738 227 
shared one mVSG  (DN18105),  suggesting some level of conservation across strains. This is 228 
the first identification of the mVSG  repertoire in these strains.   229 
 230 
Individual parasite transcriptomes  were then mapped to the assembly  to generate counts for 231 
each putative mVSG . MVSG  transcripts were expressed by most  cells in cluster C5, followed 232 
in order by C4, C6 and C3 , with negligible expression in C1 and C2  (Figure 2B, C). Overall 233 
levels of expression were highest in cluster C5 ( Figure 2 B, C, D), with 38% ( 16/42 cells ) 234 
expressing more than one mVSG  (Figure 2 B, C, D). Multiple mVSG s were also expressed by 235 
38% ( 6/16) and 21% ( 4/19) cells in clusters C4 and C 6 respectively, and a single cell in C3  236 
(Figure 2C, 2D). [20] confirmed expression of two mVSG s in pre -metacyclics using single 237 
molecule m RNA -FISH  and put forward  a model where multiple mVSG s are transcribed at low 238 
levels initially, with a single mVSG  dominating expression  in the mature metacyclic forms . 239 
Based on this model, C4 , C5 and C 6 all contain a high proportion of pre -metacyclics , as well 240 
as some mature metacyclics . The mVSG s expressed varied over development  and between 241 
strains, with DN1222 being the dominant transcript  in C5, which  were primarily J10 cells , and 242 
DN16022  being  the dominant transcript  in C6, which were primarily 1738  cells (Figure 2D). 243 
Observed expressed mVSG s are largely consistent with the VSG s present in their strain (when 244 
there is sufficient read depth), but low read count and partial coverage result in ambiguous 245 
assignment due to sequence conservation between VSG s.    246 . CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

 10 Pseudotime  analysis of salivary gland development  257 
To understand fine -scale changes  in expression patterns during  development of salivary gland  258 
parasites, we  focused on the 161 salivary gland  cells of strain 1738 collected  over three time 259 
points  (day 21, 24, 40  pi). The UMAP projection of  these cells showed a general 260 
correspondence with the cluster s identified in Figure 1C, with the left-hand  group of cells 261 
representing clusters C3 and C4 (day 21/24 pi, early and late epimastigotes) and the right- 262 
hand group  predominantly  representing cluster C6 which included most of the  day 40 pi 263 
transcriptomes  (Figure 3A, B ). The small branch connect ing these two groups contained 264

importance in the developmental transition to  metacyclics  (Figure 3C).  268

692 genes  that were differentially expressed over this trajectory ( Figure 3E, Table S4) and 272 
used hierarchical clustering to identify modules  of co-expressed genes. Modules  expressed 273 
early in development were enriched for genes involved in negative regulation of mitotic cell 274 
cycle and ATP metabolism  (modules  2 and 13, Figure 3E, Table S4), while  middle - 275 
late modules  were enriched for genes involved in translation and the ribosome , perhaps 276 
necessitated by the changes in surface proteins and metabolism associated with 277 
differentiation from epimastigotes to metacyclics  (Figure 3E, Table S4).  278 . CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

 12 Identification of hybrid progeny and strain -specific expression  286 
To investigate potential cell -types and cell -type specific responses that could be involved in 287 
sexual reproduction at day 24 post -infection, we collected J10 and 1738 p arasites from both 288 
single -strain  infected and co -infected tsetse.  In the co -infected treatment, we sorted  cells from  289 
both strains based on fluorescence  (1738 GFP+, J10 RFP+) , and sorted a small number of 290 
RFP+/GFP+ potential hybrid parasites  (16 sorted, 14 passed QC) . To confirm strain 291 
assignment, we used Souporcell to cluster different genotypes based on SNPs in the RNA - 292 
seq reads  [40]. The two genotype clusters identified were each composed of one of  the strains 293 
based on fluorescent identification with FACS (1738 GFP+ = cluster 0; J10 RFP+ = 1), and 294 
the potential hybrid progeny were identified as inter -genotypic doublets (clusters 0/1 and 1/0), 295 
with alleles present from both strains ( Figure 4A). This confirmed that six of the RFP+/GFP+ 296 
cells were genuine hybrids, while a further three  hybrid cells were identified from the RFP - 297 
/GFP+ or RFP+/GFP - groups; as the GFP and RFP genes are present on only one homologue, 298 
four hybrid genotypes with respect  to fluorescent protein genes are expected  [41]. Looking at 299 
a UMAP of all day 24 pi cells, we observed some separation of strain in both the early and late 300 
epimastigote cluster s (C3 and C4)  and clusters C5 and C6 (Figure 4B). However, we did not 301 
see clear clustering based on the infection treatment (co - vs single -infection), suggesting that 302 
there is no  strong  transcriptomic response to presence of another parasite strain ( Figure 4C). 303 
In order to unde rstand if the observed strain -specific clustering was a result of different cell - 304 
type composition or  differential expression between strains within a cell -type, we integrated 305 
the data across strains using  Seurat v3 [42]. Using this method , we were able to co -cluster 306 
the early epimastigote cells and identify 11 genes differentially expressed between the two 307 
strains ( Figure S 5, Table S5). However,  the later stage cells seen in J10 had no 308 
representation of 1738, suggesting this cell -type is unique to this strain at day 24 pi , which 309 
could be observed if the strains have different developmental rates (Figure S5). 310 
 311 
 312 
Figure 4. Classification of hybrid progeny  313 
Souporcell was  used to assign genotypes based on SNPs found between the two strains. The two 314 
genotype assignments  (0,1) were each primarily composed of one of the strains based on fluorescent 315 
identification with FACS (1738 GFP+/RFP - = cluster 0; J10 GFP-/RFP+ = 1), and the potential hybrid 316 
progeny were classified  as inter -genotypic doublets (clusters 0/1 and 1/0) . The likelihood ratio of cluster 317 
0 assignment is shown for each of the three sorted populations (A). The UMAP of day 24 mixed - and 318 
single -infection experiments coloured by strain assignment and shaped by Figure 1 cell cluster 319 
assignment (B) and infection treatment (C). 320 
Transcript levels of procyclin and candidate novel sexual stage genes correlate with 321 
protein expression in vivo . 322 
A primary aim of this study was to identify the sexual stages of T. brucei  and our results support 323 
the hypothesis that cluster C3 (Figure 1 ) represents meiotic intermediates and gametes, 324

 13 which are abundant around day 21 pi  [8–10]. Looking at expression of  genes encoding 325 
proteins known to be essential for sexual reproduction, we found high levels of expression of 326 
HAP2  and also GEX1  in cluste r C3, with some signal from the meiosis -specific genes DMC1  327 
and HOP1  (Figure 5A).  Surprisingly, these cells also expressed the procyclin  gene  GPEET , 328 
which is considered to be a marker of early procyclics  in the tsetse midgut, replaced by EP 329 
procyclins in late procyclics  [31,43] . GPEET , EP1, HAP2  and GEX1  all have the highest 330 
expression in cluster C3 (Figure 5B). We used immunofluorescence to tie  these observations 331 
to specific morphologi cal forms and to validate the presence of GPEET on the surface of 332 
salivary gland parasites  (Figure 5C, Table S6). We found that GPEET, together with EP and 333 
BARP were present in >90% of the meiotic dividers and gametes (identified by morphological 334 
features), and as expected absent in metacyclics  (Figure 5C). Epimastigotes  showed a 335 
similar pattern to the sexual forms  but lower total proportions. Additionally, we looked at 336 
proventricular  parasites and found expression  of EP and GPEET but no BARPs,  further 337 
confirming our gene expression data is matched at the protein level for these markers.    338

 14 (C2) as well as putative epimastigotes (C4) that also had high expression of BARP s (B). 344 
Immunofluorescence assays confirmed that these surface proteins  corresponded to their transcriptional 345 
profiles and were present on the epimastigote and sexual stages  (C).    346 
 347 
Cluster C3 was additionally characterised by strong and unique expression of Tb927.10.12080 348 
(Figure 1D, Figure 5A,B, Figure 6A ), and we hypothesized that this gene may play a role in 349 
sexual development. It encodes a hypothetical protein devoid of recognisable functional 350 
domains that is well -conserved in other trypanos omes including T. congolense, T. vivax, T. 351 
cruzi  and T. grayi, and the C -terminal domain in more distantly related members of the 352 
trypanosomatid family such as Leishmania  spp. The gene falls upstream of two RNA binding 353 
proteins (Tb927.10.12090 ( RBP7a ); Tb9 27.10.12100 ( RBP7b )) and the recently identified 354 
long non -coding RNA, grumpy , which all play a role in stumpy form differentiation [44,45] . 355 
Along with Tb927.10.12080, this genomic region could potentially act as a hotspot fo r 356 
differentiation and developmental processes across the parasite life cycle. Localisation data 357 
for Tb927.10.12080 from Tryptag.org is equivocal, showing punctate cytoplasmic 358 
fluorescence for the N -terminal tagged protein and a mitochondrial location in a proportion of 359 
cells for the C -terminal tagged protein. To investigate expression of this protein during 360 
development in the tsetse fly, we used the 3’ UTR to regulate expression of GFP driven by the 361 
procyclin promotor ( Figure S6 ). At 20 -22 days post infecti on, there was very little detectable 362 
expression in midgut procyclics or proventricular forms, but strong expression in salivary gland 363 
trypanosomes ( Figure 6B ). Overall, of the parasites from the salivary gland scored, 39% 364 
(182/464) showed expression ( Table  S7). These included meiotic intermediates and both 365 
1K1N and 2K1N gametes but not metacyclics or unattached epimastigotes ( Figure 6C,D ).  366 
Cell types involved in the early stages of meiosis, such as meiotic dividers and 3N cells with 367 
one diploid and two hap loid nuclei, had lower percentages of cells expressing (10% and 50% 368 
respectively) than did those involved in the later stages of meiosis and in gametes (77 -80%;  369 
Figure 6C  & Table S7 ). At 37 -38 days post infection, the percentage of fluorescent 370 
trypanosomes  dropped (103/682; 15%) and these cells were misshapen with no recognisable 371 
gametes or sexual intermediates. Further work is needed to understand the functional role of 372 
Tb927.10.12080 in meiosis and sexual development; however, its unique pattern of transc ript 373 
and protein expression indicate it could play a vital role in processes that allow for genetic 374 
exchange in T. brucei  and perhaps more broadly in kinetoplastids.  375 . CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Conclusion  391 
Here we applied single -cell RNA sequencing to explore the heterogeneous trypanosome 392 
population s in the tsetse fly. These data provide a resource for the parasitology community , 393 
which we have made available via an interactive we bsite ( http://cellatlas.mvls.gla.ac.uk/ ). 394 
Additionally, this data set allowed us to elucidate the transcriptional profiles of key life cycle 395 
stages  in the salivary glands including the sexual stages. From this mixture of cell types, we 396 
were able to identify a cluster of cells that shared a particular transcriptomic profile 397 
characterized by high expression of the gene encodi ng the gamete fusion protein HAP2, 398 
together with several unstudied genes. One of these was a kinetoplastid-conser ved gene 399 
Tb927.10.12080, which was exclusively expressed at high levels by meiotic intermediates and 400 
gametes. We specul ate that this protein, currently of unknow n function, plays a role in gamete 401 
formation and/or fusion. 402 
 403 
Materials and Methods 404 
Data collection 405 
Trypanosome culture and tsetse  infection  406 
The following tsetse-transmissible strains of Trypanosoma brucei brucei were used: T. b. 407 
brucei J10 (MCRO/ZM/73/J10) and 1738 (MOVS/KE/70/EATRO 1738); each was genetically 408 
modified to express a fluorescent protein gene (J10 RFP, 1738 GFP). Mating between these 409 
strains has been demonstrated previously [41] and 1738 reliably produces large numbers of 410 
gametes around day 21 post-infection [9]. Procyclic form (PF) trypanosomes were grown in 411 
Cunningham’s medium (CM) [46] suppl emented with 15 % v/v heat-inactivated foetal calf 412 
serum, 5 µg/ml hemin and 10 µg/ml gentamycin at 27oC. Tsetse flies (Glossina pallidipes) 413 
were infected with PF trypanosomes, maintained and dissect ed as descr ibed previously [8]. 414 
 415 
Parasite isolation from tsetse tissues  for scRNA -seq 416 
Free swimming parasites were obtained from G. pallidipes by separ ately pooling tissues into 417 
CM (5 midguts in 500 µl CM; 5 provent riculi in 50 µl CM; 20 sets of salivary glands  in 50 µl 418 
CM). Tissues were incubated at RT for 10 minutes prior to filtration through a 100 µm filter. 419 
Cells were washed once with 1 ml CM prior to preservation or sorting. At day 40 pi, the 420 
parasites attached to the salivary glands  were isolated by disassociation of the tissue after the 421 . CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

 17 10-minute incubation period. Forceps were used to transfer the tissue to an enzymatic solution 422 
consisti ng of 200 µl Collagenase IV (1 mg/ml) and 25 µl of Elastase (4 mg/ml). The sample 423 
was then incubated at 30°C for 40 min with shaking at 300 rpm. During the incubation, the 424 
tissue was disrupted by pipetting up and down 40 times every 15 minutes at first wit h a p1000 425 
pipette set to 150 µl and then with a p200 set to 100 µl once the tissue started to break  up.  426 
Cell preservation  427 
A subset of cells was preserved prior to cell sorting to allow for greater flexibility in the time 428 
between collections and FACS. The day 40 pi salivary glands  parasites  (attached and free) 429 
cells were fixed by  adding 200 µl of dithio -bis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Lomant’s 430 
reagent)  dropwise  to the cell pellet as described in [47]. DSP fixed  samples were incubated at 431 
room temperature for 30 minutes prior to adding 4 µl 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Samples were then 432 
stored at 4°C for up to 24 hours. Prior to sorting, DTT was added to a final concent ration of 50 433 
mM. The day 24 pi salivary gland parasites (cross vs single infection) were preserved by 434 
resuspending the cell pellet in 200 µl Hypothermosol-FRS (BioLifeSolutions) [48]. Samples 435 
were then stored at 4°C for 5 hours prior to sorting. 436 
Cell sorting, library preparation and sequencing  437 
All parasite cells were sorted within 24 hours of collection on an Influx cell sorter (BD 438 
Biosciences) with a 200 µm nozzl e or a Sony SH800 with 100 µm chip. Parasites were sorted 439 
based on RFP and/or GFP fluorescence into nuclease -free 96 well plates containing lysis 440 
buffer as descr ibed previously [12]. Sorted plates were spun at 1000 g for 10 seconds and 441 
immediately placed on dry ice. Reverse transcription, PCR, and library preparation were 442 
performed as descr ibed in [12]. Cells were multiplexed to 384 and sequenced on a single lane 443 
of Illumina HiSeq2500 v4 with 75 bp paired-end reads.  444 
Immunofluorescence  445 
Salivary glands, proventriculi and midguts from infected flies (20-22 days pi) were pooled 446 
separ ately into CM and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 minutes (to allow 447 
trypanosomes to swim out of tissue) and then filtered through a 100 µm filter with PBS.   448 
Trypanosomes were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 µl PBS.  Cells were 449 
fixed overnight at 4oC by adding 100 µl 6% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS,  450 
and then washed twice with PBS before resuspensi on in 50 µl PBS. Cell suspensi ons were 451 
pipetted onto 2 x 10 mm cover slips, allowed to settle for 20 mins in a humid cham ber, and 452 
then liquid was removed and replaced by 2% BSA in PBS. After 30 mins liquid was removed 453 
and cells incubat ed with 2% BSA in PBS containing diluted antibody  for 30 mins at RT. Rabbit 454 
anti-GPEET (1:1000) and rabbit anti-BARP (1:1000) were a kind gift from Isobel Roditi, 455 
University of Bern, Switzerland; mouse anti-EP mAB (1:100) was from Cedarlane. Cells were 456 
washed three times with PBS and incubated with 2% BSA in PBS containing anti-rabbit FITC 457 
(1:1000) and anti-mouse TRITC (1:1000) for 30 mins at RT. Cells were washed three times 458 
with PBS,  briefly air dried, stained with DAPI  in VECTASHI ELD mounting medium (Vector 459 
Labor atories) and viewed using a DMRB microscope (Leica) equipped with a Retiga Exi 460 
camera (QImaging) and Volocity software (PerkinElmer). The whole area of the coverslip was 461 
scanned systematically from top to bottom, capturing FITC, TRITC, DAPI  and phase contrast 462 
images of each trypanosome. Digital images were analysed using ImageJ 463

 18 Tb927.10.12080 gene expression  465 
The 3’ UTR of Tb927.10.12080 was amplified from genomic DNA of 1738 using the primers 466 
5’- GATCCTCGAGTAGTGGCGAGTGTTTACAACAGTGTC  and 5’ - 467 
GATCGGGCCCCTTGTGCGGATCCAAACAA, and inserted immediately downstream of a 468 
GFP gene driven b y the procyclin promotor from plasmid backbone pHD449, which is 469 
designed for insertion into the tubulin locus  (Figure S 6) [49,50] . The plasmid construct was 470 
used for stable transfection of procyclic 1738 and following hygromycin selection, clones were 471 
tsetse fly transmitted as described by Peacock et al 2011, 2014. Flies were dissected 10 to 40 472 
days pi and o rgans viewed by fluorescence microscopy and imaged live or fixed in 2% 473 
paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector 474 
Laboratories).   475 
scRNAseq d ata analysis  476 
Mapping and generation of expression matrices  477 
Nextera adaptor seque nces were trimmed from fastq files using trim_galore ( -q 20 -a 478 
CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT --paired --stringency 3 --length 50 -e 0.1) (v 0.4.3)  [51]. Trimmed 479 
reads were mapped using HISAT2 (hisat2 --max-intronlen 5000 -p 12) (v 2.1.0) [52] to the T. 480 
b. brucei 927 genom e. The GFF was conver ted to GTF using the UCSC genom e browser tool 481 
[53]. Reads were then summed against genes using HTseq (htseq-count  -f bam -r pos -s no - 482 
t CDS) (v 0.7.1) [54]. 483 
Assembly of VSG transcripts  484 
Because there is a lack of conservation of VSG s across T. brucei strains, we built a de novo  485 
transcriptome assembly to identify the mVSG transcripts expressed in 1738 and J10. First, we 486 
merged the BAM files across the 388 cells and converted to FASTQ using bedtools (v. 2.29.2) 487 
[55]. Using Trinity (v. 2.1.1) [56] to assemble the transcripts from this merged file, we detected 488 
53521 ‘genes’  with a mean contig length of 800 bp. We then mapped each cell to this assem bly 489 
using RSEM (v. 1.3.3) to generate a counts matrix and used Transdecoder (v. 5.5.0) to detect 490 
open reading frames [57]. BLASTp (v. 2.9.0) was used to match to putative VSG s that had 491 
been curated independent ly from whole genom e data as descr ibed below.  Transcripts 492 
with >90% identity were used for further analysis.  493 
Genomes for the parent strains J10 and 1738 were assembled from 76 bp paired read Illumina 494 
data using SPADES under  default parameters. Predicted mVSGs were identified to genom ic 495 
loci, using BLAST against the assembled contigs with a percent identity across the entire 496 
transcript >95%, alignments of a raw score of greater than 1000 were further investigated. 497 
Additional open reading frames were identified by BLAST alignment of the curated 927 498 
annot ated CDS set. Nhmmer was used to identify putative mVSG promoters from the 499 
alignments [38,39].  500 
Quality control and normalization  501 
Quality control and visualisation was performed in Scater (v. 1.12.2) [58]. Cell quality was 502 
assessed based on the distribution of genes detected per single-cell transcr iptome. Cells with 503 
fewer than 40 genes or more than 3000 genes detected were removed,  as well as cells that 504 
had fewer than 1000 total reads.  These QC thresholds allowed us to keep more cells in the 505 . CC-BY 4.0 International license perpetuity.

 19 analysis that are likely to be less transcriptionally active such as mature metacyclics. Out of 506 
515 parasites isolated from tsetse tissue that were sequenced, 388 passed quality control and 507 
were used for downstream analyses. Raw count data was normalized using a deconvolution 508 
size factor in Scran (v. 1.16.0) [59] to account for differences in overall level of expression 509 
between cell -types.  510 
Cell clustering, projection, and marker genes  511 
In order to unbiasedly group transcriptomes based on similar expression profiles, 388 cells 512 
collected from the tsetse were clustered using K -means clustering in SC3 (v. 1.12.0) [32]. 513 
Dimensionality reduction was performed in Scater (v. 1.12.2) [58] using Principal Component 514 
Analysis (PCA) with the 500 most variable genes based o n log2 normalised expression values. 515 
Marker genes were identified for each cluster using SC3 (AUROC >0.75 & adjusted p-value < 516 
0.01).  517 
Identification of hybrid parasites  and data integration  518 
To select different parasite genotypes (J10, 1738, or J10x1738 cro ss) in the mixed infection 519 
treatment, we first FACS sorted based on GFP+ (1738), RFP+ (J10), or GFP+/RFP+ (hybrid) 520 
expression. We then used souporcell (-k 2 -p 2) (v2.0) [40] to confirm genotype assi gnment 521 
based on SNP profiles from the scRNA -seq. 522 
 523 
To identif y genes that were differentially expressed between the two strains , we used Seurat  524 
(v3.1.5) to integrated the data by identifying anchors with the FindIntegrationAnchors () and 525 
IntegrateData() functions. The data was then clustered using FindNeighbors() with the top 30 526 
principal  components and FindClusters() with a resolution  of 0.5.  Differential expression was 527 
performed using the FindMarkers() function  (adjusted p-value < 0.001) . The same integration 528 
methods were used to compare the data to [20] except that the top 20 principal components  529 
were used, the cluster resolution was 0.8 and the FindConservedMarkers() function  identified 530 
markers found in both studies  (max p-value < 0.001) . 531 
Pseudotime and diff erential expression  532 
To assess developmental progression in 1738 salivary glands  parasites from day 21 -, 24-, 533 
and 40 -days pi, Slingshot (v. 1.8.0) was used to infer a pseudotime developmental trajectory 534 
[60]. Genes differentially expressed over thi s trajectory were identified using the 535 
associationTest() function in TradeSeq (v. 1.4.0)  [61]. 536

singe -cell transcriptome s  757 
Forty -eight transcriptomes were generated using Smart -seq2 from parasites in a procyclic 758 
culture including a no cell and ten cell control. (A) The distribution of the total counts and total 759 
features (genes) detected in these 48 transcriptomes. (B) The total features plotted against 760 
total counts for the 46 single -cell transcriptomes shows a plateau as features and counts 761 
increase,  suggest ing that sequencing was saturated for these cells.  We detected a mean of 762 
2.6x106 reads and 1756 features per single -cell transcriptome. (C) Expression of procyclic 763

The distribution of genes detected (left) and counts (right) in each cell across the three insect 769 
tissues: midgut (MG), proventriculus (PV), and salivary glands (SG). Cells with fewer than 40 770 
or more than 3000 genes per cell were removed. Additionally, cells wit h fewer than 1000 reads 771 
were removed. Cut-offs are represented by the red vertical lines in each histogram. After QC 772 
we detected a mean of 889 genes per cell and 1.1x105 counts per cell. 773

Figure S 4. Integration with Hutchinson et al  784 
All 388  tsetse gland transcriptomes  were  integrated with Hutchinson et al  data collected from 785 
salivary glands using S eurat’s data integration function. Plots show the UMAP of integrated 786 
data coloured by study (A), cluster identity from the different studies (paper_id) (B), integrated 787 
cluster assignment (C), or gene of interest (D-F). FHc (Tb92 7.3.4500 ) was the top  marker 788 
gene (based on adjusted p -value) for the midgut and proventricular form cluster 4 (D). 789 
Tb927.7.380  (hypothetical protein, conserved)  was the top marker gene for cluster 3 which 790 
contained gamete and epimastigote  forms. HAP2  (Tb927.10.10770) (F) was not a marker 791 
gene for the gamete cluster likely because of its ubiquitous expression across non -metacyclic 792 
forms.  Although we were able to identify  conserved marker genes across the two studies, 793

 29 separation remained in the UMAP for all cell -types (A-B) and only the non -metacyclic forms 794 
co-clustered across the two studies and only at a granular level. The metacylic forms likely did 795 
not cluster together because of different VSG repertoires , and the separat ion across other 796 
cell-types may be due to time point , strain -specific expression patterns , or collection methods. 797
