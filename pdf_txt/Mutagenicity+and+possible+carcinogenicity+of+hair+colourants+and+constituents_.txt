FOREWORD;  This report presents  the results  of the  bioassay  of
 
4-amino-2-nitrophenol  conducted  for the  Carcinogenesis Testing
 
Program, Division  of Cancer Cause  and Prevention, National Cancer
 
Institute  (NCI),  National Institutes  of Health, Bethesda,
 
Maryland. This  is one of a  series of experiments designed  to
 
determine  whether selected chemicals have  the capacity  to produce
 
cancer in animals. Negative results,  in which the test animals
 
do not have a greater incidence  of cancer than control animals,
 
do not necessarily mean that  the test chemical  is not a
 
carcinogen, inasmuch  as the  experiments  are conducted under  a
 
limited set of circumstances. Positive results demonstrate  that
 
the test chemical  is carcinogenic  for animals under  the
 
conditions  of the test and indicate  that exposure  to the chemical
 
is a potential risk  to man. The actual determination  of the risk
 
to man from animal carcinogens requires  a wider analysis.

 SUMMARY
 
A bioassay  of 4-amino-2-nitrophenol  for possible carcinogenicity
 
was conducted  by administering  the test chemical  in feed to
 
Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice.
 
Groups of 50  rats and 50  mice of each sex were administered
 
4-amino-2-nitrophenol  at one of two  doses, either  1,250 or 2,500
 
ppm, for 103  weeks. Matched controls consisted  of groups of 20
 
untreated  rats and 20 untreated mice  of each sex. All dosed and
 
matched-control groups  of each species  and sex  were killed  at 105
 
weeks.
 
Mean body weights  of dosed rats  of each sex were not appreciably
 
affected  by administration  of the 4-amino-2-nitrophenol,  and mean
 
body weights  of dosed mice  of each sex were only slightly lower
 
than those  of corresponding matched controls. Survival  of
 
neither rats  nor mice was affected  by the  test chemical,  and
 
sufficient  numbers  of animals  in dosed and control groups were  at
 
risk for development  of late-appearing tumors. Since both male
 
and female mice receiving  4-amino-2-nitrophenol  had little or no
 
depression  in mean weights  and their survival  was comparable  to
 
that of controls,  they may have been able  to tolerate  a higher
 
dose.
 
In rats, transitional-cell carcinomas  of the  urinary bladder
 
showed a dose-related  trend in the males (P < 0.001) and occurred
 
at a significantly  higher incidence  (P = 0.018) in the high-dose
 
males than  in the matched-control males (controls  0/15, low-dose
 
0/46, high-dose  11/39 [28%]).  Carcinomas  of the  bladder also
 
occurred  in one low-dose  female and two  high-dose females,  but in
 
none of the control  females.  Transitional-cell papillomas  of the
 
bladder occurred  in two  additional high-dose males,  and
 
transitional-cell hyperplasia  of the  bladder occurred  in four
 
additional high-dose males,  but neither  lesion  occurred  in
 
control males. No tumors of the  bladder  were found among 220
 
male and 220  female historical-control rats  at this laboratory.
 
In mice, no tumors occurred  in dosed groups of males or females
 
vii
 at incidences  that were significantly  higher than those  in the
 
corresponding matched-control groups.
 
Deposition  of pigment occurred  in the lamina propria  of the small
 
intestine  in at least 91% of the  animals  in the  dosed groups  of
 
rats and in at  least 89% of the  animals  in the  dosed groups  of
 
mice, but in none of the control groups  of either species.
 
It is concluded  that under the conditions  of the  bioassay,
 
4-amino-2-nitrophenol  was carcinogenic  for male Fischer  344 rats,
 
inducing transitional-cell carcinomas  of the  urinary bladder;  the
 
transitional-cell carcinomas  of the  urinary bladder observed  in
 
three dosed female rats  may also have been associated with
 
administration  of the  4-amino-2-nitrophenol.  The test chemical
 
was not carcinogenic  for male or female B6C3F1 mice  at the doses
 
tested.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 
4-Amino-2-nitrophenol  (CAS
 
119-34-6;  NCI C03963)  is used
 
as an  industrial  dye
 
intermediate,  and as a
 
constituent  of  "semi- OH
 
permanent" hair dyes.
 4-AMINO-2-IMITROPHEIMOL
 
This compound  is designated CI76555  by the  Society  of Dyers and
 
Colourists,  who describe  its industrial  use as an  oxidation base
 
(Oxidation Base  25) in applications involving furs. These bases
 
are applied  in conjunction with  an oxidizing agent, such  as hydro­
gen peroxide,  for the  development  of the color (Society  of Dyers
 
and Colourists,  1971).
 
In contrast,  in hair dyes  for humans,  4-amino-2-nitrophenol  is
 
formulated  without  an oxidizing agent.  It is  used in
 
concentrations estimated  at 0.1-1.0%  in the "semi-permanent" hair
 
dyes, which  are applied  as shampoos  and remain on the  hair for
 
20-40 minutes before  they are rinsed out (Wall, 1972;  Corbett  and
 
Menkart, 1973; Burnett  et al., 1976; FDA,  1977).
 
4-Amino-2-nitrophenol  was one of a  group of hair dye constituents
 
selected  for the  Carcinogenesis Testing Program because several
 
of these chemicals  had been shown to be mutagenic  in bacterial
 
test systems (work later published  by Ames et al., 1975).
 II. MATERIALS  AND METHODS
 
A. Chemical
 
Two batches  of 4-amino-2-nitrophenol  were obtained from  the
 
Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee,  Wisconsin.  Lot No.  071137
 
was used in the  subchronic studies;  Lot No.  100737 was used in
 
the chronic studies.
 
The identity  of both lots  was established through  elemental
 
analyses (C, H, N), and  spectral data  (ultraviolet,  infrared,  and
 
nuclear magnetic  resonance).  Lot No.  071137 had a purity of 99.0
 
+ 0.3% as determined  by perchloric acid titration  of the  amine
 
function,  and Lot No.  100737 had a purity of 99.6 + 0.3% by the
 
same method. Vapor-phase  chromatography  and thin-layer  chromato­
graphy showed several trace impurities  in Lot No.  071137 and one
 
impurity in Lot No.  100737.  Lot No.  071137 contained 0.18  +
 
0.01% water,  and Lot No.  100737,  less than 0.2% water,  as
 
determined  by Karl Fischer  analysis.  Melting ranges were similar
 
for each lot (Lot No. 100737:  128-130°C  [visual,  capillary];  Lot
 
No. 671137: 126.5-129°C  [visual,  capillary])  and corresponded  to
 
values in the literature  (127-128°C)  (Verkade  et al., 1946).
 
After the completion  of the  bioassay,  a sample from  Lot No.
 
100737 was reanalyzed.  The infrared spectrum  of this lot was
 identical with that obtained  in the  original  analysis,  and
 
perchloric acid titration indicated 98.7  + 0.2% purity.
 
The bulk chemical  was stored at 4°C.
 
B. Dietary Preparation
 
A 6-kilogram  diet was prepared three times  per week for the  rats
 
and two times per week for the  mice. To obtain each dietary
 
concentration,  the appropriate weight  of the  compound  was mixed
 
with a small portion  of Wayne® Lab Blox animal meal  (Allied
 
Mills, Inc., Chicago,  111.) in a mortar.  This premix was then
 
added to the  remaining feed  and blended  for 15  minutes  in a
 
Patterson-Kelly twin-shell blender equipped with  an intensifier
 
bar. Dosed  feed preparations were stored  at 4°C for up to 1
 
week.
 
As a quality control measure, selected samples from  14 freshly
 
prepared  diets were analyzed during  the chronic studies.  The
 
compound  was extracted from feed with  0.1 N ammonium hydroxide  in
 
1:1 water:methanol,  diluted with  methanol,  centrifuged,  and the
 
absorbance  of the  supernatant read  at 445  nm. Concentrations
 
were found  to be within 25% of theoretical concentrations.
 
C. Animals
 
Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice were obtained from  the Frederick
 Cancer Research Center, Frederick, Maryland, under  a contract
 
with the Division  of Cancer Treatment, NCI.
 
The animals were  28 days of age when received  at the  laboratory
 
and were quarantined  for 2 weeks prior to the  start of the
 
bioassay.  Any animals with clinical signs  of disease  and any
 
runts were destroyed.  The remaining animals were segregated into
 
equal weight groups  and assigned  to control  or dosed groups  in
 
such a way that the mean weights  of animals  in each cage within  a
 
particular group  were approximately  the same.
 
D. Animal  Maintenance
 
All animals were housed  in temperature-  and humidity-controlled
 
rooms. The temperature  was maintained  at 21-25°C  and the
 
relative humidity  at 45-55%.  There were  15 changes  of room air
 
per hour, and the  incoming  and exhaust  air was  filtered through
 
high efficiency particulate  air (HEPA) filters.  The animal rooms
 
were positively pressurized with respect  to the  exit hall  and
 
negatively  pressurized  with respect  to the  entrance  hall. Rooms
 
were illuminated with cool white fluorescent lighting  for 8 hours
 
per day.
 
Rats were housed four  per cage and mice five  per cage in solid
 
polycarbonate  cages (Lab Products, Inc., Garfield,  N. J.). Each
 
cage was covered with  a wire mesh screen  and a sheet of filter
 paper, and contained  a heat-treated hardwood chip bedding
 
(Absorb-Dri®,  Lab Products,  Inc., Garfield,  N. J.) in the  bottom.
 
Cages were washed  and furnished with fresh bedding  two times per
 
week. Water bottles, sipper tubes  and stoppers were  also washed
 
twice per week while feed hoppers were washed once  per week. All
 
of this equipment  was cleaned  at 82°C with detergent, rinsed,  and
 
steamed.
 
Control animals were  fed Wayne® Lab Blox animal meal,  and dosed
 
animals received  the same product  mixed with  the test chemical.
 
The feed hoppers were filled three times  per week. Acidified  tap
 
water (pH 2.5) was available  ad libitum in water bottles.
 
Rats and mice were housed  in separate  rooms. Control  and dosed
 
animals were housed  in the  same room  as the  respective dosed
 
animals. Animals  fed 4-amino-2-nitrophenol  were maintained  in
 
the same rooms  as animals  of the same species being administered
 
one of the  following chemicals:

E. Subchronic  Studies
 
Subchronic  studies were conducted with Fischer  344 rats and
 
B6C3F1 mice of each sex to  estimate  the maximum tolerated doses
 
of 4-amino-2-nitrophenol,  on the  basis  of which  two
 
concentrations (hereinafter referred  to as  "low" and "high"
 
doses) were selected  for the  chronic studies.
 
4-Amino-2-nitrophenol  was administered  in the diet to rats at one
 
of 11 doses, either 147, 215, 316, 464, 681,  1,000, 1,470, 2,150,
 
3,160, 4,640, or 6,810 ppm and to  mice at one of 11  doses, either
 
100, 147, 215, 316, 464, 681,  1,000,  1,470, 2,150, 3,160, or
 
4,640 ppm. Groups  of five males  and five females were tested  at
 each dose, and groups  of equal size were used  as matched
 
controls.  The compound  was administered  for 6 weeks, and the
 
animals were observed  for the  following  2 weeks.
 
After the 6  weeks of compound  administration,  there were  no
 
deaths in the rats or the mice, nor were there  any changes  in the
 
mean body weights  of the  dosed animals  in comparison with  the
 
controls, other than  an approximate  20% weight depression  in
 
female rats  fed concentrations  of 3,160 ppm and greater.  No
 
gross pathologic changes were reported.
 
The doses selected  for the  chronic studies  in both species were
 
1,250 and 2,500 ppm.
 
F. Chronic  Studies
 
The test groups, doses  administered,  and times on study of the
 
chronic feeding studies  are shown in tables 1 and 2.
 
G. Clinical  and Pathologic Examinations
 
All animals were observed twice daily  for signs of toxicity,  and
 
animals that were moribund were killed  and necropsied. Rats  and
 
mice were weighed  at regular intervals. Palpation  for masses was
 
carried out at each weighing.
 
The pathologic  evaluation  consisted  of gross and microscopic

 examination  of major tissues, major  organs,  and all  gross lesions
 
from killed animals  and from animals found dead.  All animals
 
were killed with carbon dioxide.  The following tissues were
 
examined  microscopically:  skin, lymph nodes, mammary gland,
 
salivary gland, bone marrow, trachea, lungs  and bronchi, heart,
 
thyroid,  parathyroid, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large
 
intestine,  liver, gallbladder  (mice),  pancreas, spleen, kidney,
 
adrenal, urinary bladder, prostate  or uterus, testis  or ovary,
 
brain, and pituitary.  Occasionally,  additional tissues were also
 
examined microscopically.  The different tissues were preserved
 
in 10% buffered formalin, embedded  in paraffin, sectioned,  and
 
stained with hematoxylin  and eosin. An occasional section  was
 
subjected  to special staining techniques  for more definitive
 
diagnosis.
 
A few tissues from some animals were  not examined, particularly
 
from those animals that  died early. Also, some animals  may have
 
been missing, cannibalized,  or judged to be in  such an advanced
 
state of autolysis  as to  preclude histopathologic evaluation.
 
Thus, the number of animals  from which particular  organs  or
 
tissues were examined microscopically varies,  and does not
 
necessarily represent  the number of animals  that were placed  on
 
study in each group.

 H. Data Recording  and Statistical Analyses
 
Pertinent  data on this experiment have been recorded  in an auto­
matic data processing system,  the Carcinogenesis Bioassay Data
 
System (Linhart  et al., 1974). The data elements include descrip­
tive information  on the  chemicals, animals, experimental design,
 
clinical  observations,  survival,  body weight,  and individual
 
pathologic  results,  as recommended  by the  International Union
 
Against Cancer (Berenblum,  1969). Data tables were generated  for
 
verification  of data transcription  and for  statistical review.
 
These data were analyzed using  the statistical techniques
 
described  in this section.  Those  analyses  of the  experimental
 
results that bear on the  possibility  of carcinogenicity  are
 
discussed  in the statistical narrative sections.
 
Probabilities  of survival were estimated  by the  product-limit
 
procedure  of Kaplan and Meier (1958)  and are  presented  in this
 
report in the  form of graphs. Animals were statistically
 
censored  as of the  time that they died  of other than natural
 
causes or were found  to be missing;  animals  dying from natural
 
causes were  not statistically censored. Statistical analyses  for
 
a possible dose-related effect  on survival used  the method of Cox
 
(1972) for testing  two groups for equality  and Tarone's  (1975)
 
extensions  of Cox's methods  for testing  for a dose-related trend.
 
12
 One-tailed  P values have been reported  for all  tests except  the
 
departure from  linearity  test, which is only reported  when its
 
two-tailed  P value is less than 0.05.
 
The incidence  of neoplastic  or nonneoplastic lesions  has been
 
given as the ratio of the  number of animals bearing such lesions
 
at a specific anatomic site (numerator)  to the  number of animals
 
in which that site  is examined  (denominator).  In most instances,
 
the denominators included only those animals  for which that site
 
was examined  histologically.  However, when macroscopic examin­
ation was required  to detect lesions  prior to histologic  sampling
 
(e.g., skin or mammary  tumors),  or when lesions could have
 
appeared  at multiple sites  (e.g.,  lymphomas),  the denominators
 
consist of the numbers  of animals necropsied.
 
The purpose  of the statistical analyses  of tumor incidence  is to
 
determine  whether animals receiving  the test chemical developed  a
 
significantly  higher proportion  of tumors than  did the  control
 
animals.  As a  part of these analyses,  the one-tailed Fisher
 
exact test (Cox, 1970)  was used to compare  the tumor incidence  of
 
a control group with  that of a group of dosed animals  at each
 
dose level. When results  for a number of dosed groups  (k) are
 
compared  simultaneously with those  for a  control group,  a
 
correction  to ensure an overall significance level  of 0.05 may be
 
made. The Bonferroni inequality (Miller, 1966) requires  that the
 
13
 P value for any  comparison  be less than  or equal to 0.05/k.  In
 
cases where this correction  was used, it is discussed  in the
 
narrative section.  It is  not, however,  presented  in the tables,
 
where the Fisher exact  P values are shown.
 
The Cochran-Armitage test  for linear trend in proportions, with
 
continuity correction  (Armitage,  1971), was also used. Under  the
 
assumption  of a linear trend, this test determines  if the  slope
 
of the dose-response curve  is different from zero  at the  one-
tailed 0.05 level  of significance.  Unless otherwise noted,  the
 
direction  of the  significant  trend is a positive dose relation­
ship. This method also provides  a two-tailed  test of departure
 
from linear trend.
 
A time-adjusted analysis  was applied when numerous early deaths
 
resulted from causes  that were not associated with  the formation
 
of tumors.  In this analysis,  deaths that occurred before  the
 
first tumor was observed were excluded  by basing the statistical
 
tests on animals that survived  at least 52 weeks, unless a tumor
 
was found at the anatomic site  of interest before  week 52. When
 
such an early tumor  was found, comparisons were based exclusively
 
on animals that survived  at least as long as the  animal in which
 
the first tumor  was found. Once this reduced  set of  data was
 
obtained,  the standard procedures  for analyses  of the incidence
 
14
 of tumors (Fisher  exact tests, Cochran-Armitage tests,  etc.) were
 
followed.
 
When appropriate, life-table methods were used  to analyze  the
 
incidence  of tumors. Curves  of the proportions surviving without
 
an observed tumor were computed  as in Saffiotti  et al. (1972).
 
The week during which  an animal died naturally  or was  sacrificed
 
was entered  as the  time point  of tumor observation.  Cox's
 
methods of comparing these  curves  were used  for two  groups;
 
Tarone's  extension  to testing  for linear trend  was used for three
 
groups. The statistical tests  for the  incidence  of tumors which
 
used life-table methods  were one-tailed  and, unless  otherwise
 
noted, in the  direction  of a positive dose  relationship.
 
Significant departures from linearity  (P < 0.05, two-tailed test)
 
were also noted.
 
The approximate  95 percent  confidence  interval  for the  relative
 
risk of each dosed group compared  to its  control  was calculated
 
from the exact interval  on the  odds ratio (Gart,  1971). The
 
relative risk  is defined  as Pt/Pc where  pj- is the  true binomial
 
probability  of the  incidence  of a specific type  of tumor in a
 
dosed group of animals  and pc is the  true probability  of the
 
spontaneous incidence  of the  same type of tumor in a control
 
group. The hypothesis  of equality between  the true proportion  of
 
a specific tumor  in a dosed group  and the  proportion  in a control
 
15
 group corresponds  to a relative  risk of unity. Values  in excess
 
of unity represent  the condition  of a larger proportion  in the
 
dosed group than  in the control.
 
The lower and upper limits  of the  confidence interval  of the
 
relative  risk have been included  in the  tables of statistical
 
analyses.  The  interpretation  of the  limits  is that in
 
approximately  95% of a  large number  of identical experiments,  the
 
true ratio of the risk in a dosed group  of animals  to that in a
 
control group would  be within the interval calculated from  the
 
experiment.  When the lower limit  of the  confidence interval  is
 
greater than one,  it can be  inferred that  a statistically
 
significant result  (P < 0.025 one-tailed  test when the control
 
incidence  is not zero, P < 0.050 when the control  incidence  is
 
zero) has occurred. When  the lower limit  is less than unity,  but
 
the upper limit  is greater than unity,  the lower limit indicates
 
the absence  of a significant result while  the upper limit
 
indicates  that there is a theoretical possibility  of the
 
induction  of tumors  by the  test chemical, which could  not be
 
detected  under the conditions  of this test.

 III. RESULTS  - RATS
 
A. Body Weights  and Clinical Signs  (Rats)
 
Mean body weights  of dosed male  and female rats were  not
 
appreciably affected  by the  administration  of 4-amino-2­
nitrophenol (figure  1). Fluctuation  in the  growth curve  may be
 
due to mortality;  as the  size of a group diminishes,  the mean
 
body weight may be subject  to variation.  No other clinical  signs
 
were reported  on the animals administered  the test chemical.
 
B. Survival  (Rats)
 
The Kaplan  and Meier curves estimating  the probabilities  of
 
survival  for male and female rats administered  4-amino-2­
nitrophenol  in the  diet at the  doses of this bioassay, together
 
with those  of the matched  controls,  are shown in figure 2. The
 
result of the Tarone test for dose-related trend  in mortality  is
 
not significant  in either sex.
 
In male rats,  33/50 (66%) of the  high-dose group,  37/50 (74%) of
 
the low-dose group,  and 12/20 (60%)  of the  matched-control  group
 
lived to termination  of the  study. In females,  37/50 (74%) of
 
the high-dose  group, 36/49 (74%) of the  low-dose group,  and 14/20
 
(70%) of the  matched-control group survived  to termination  of the
 
study.

Transitional-cell

Transitional-cell

Microscopically,  the transitional-cell tumors varied from
 
papillary  structures packed with hyperchromatic epithelial  cells,
 
pleomorphic  nuclei,  and mitotic figures  to subepithelial,  dome-
shaped solid masses  of similar tumor  cells. The masses often
 
20
 protruded  into the bladder lumen. There  was invasion  of the
 
bladder wall, and in one  case metastases appeared  in the lungs.
 
Other remaining tumors  that occurred  in the  control  and dosed
 
rats were considered spontaneous. Most  of them had incidences  as
 
expected  for this age and  Fischer  344 strain of rat. In these
 
cases there were approximate equivalent frequencies  and expected
 
sex predilections  for tumors  and hyperplasias,  including
 
testicular interstitial-cell tumors  in the  males, pituitary
 
chromophobe  tumors mainly  in females,  and C-cell  tumors  and
 
hyperplasias  of the  thyroid  in both sexes.
 
There were  a few randomly distributed malignant tumors  in the
 
dosed rats that  did not  occur in the  controls, including  an
 
epidermoid  (squamous-cell)  carcinoma  of the  salivary gland (1/47
 
high-dose  males);  a fibrosarcoma (1/50 high-dose  males);  an osteo­
sarcoma (1/50 high-dose  females);  and a  chondrosarcoma  (1/50
 
high-dose  females)  that metastasized  to the lung, but because  of
 
the single occurrences they were  not considered significant.
 
There occurred also  a variety  of nonneoplastic lesions  that are
 
commonly observed  in Fischer  344 rats.
 
Pigmentary changes occurred  in the  lamina propria  of the  small
 
intestines  in 44/45 low-dose  males, 43/45 high-dose males,  43/44
 
low-dose females,  and 43/47 high-dose females.  The pigment  was
 
21
 dark brown  and finely granular.  It was  within macrophages  of the
 
lamina propria  and usually  oriented more towards  the tips of the
 
villi. The pigment  was not  birefringent under polarized light
 
and was negative  for iron (Prussian-blue).  It was  melanin-like,
 
and appeared  to be more abundant  in the high-dose group.
 
There were degenerative  and inflammatory conditions usually
 
encountered  in aging rats.
 
The results  of the histopathologic examination indicate  that the
 
transitional-cell tumors  of the urinary bladder occurring  in the
 
high-dose male rats  and in the  low- and high-dose females,  the
 
transitional-cell papillomas  and hyperplasias  occurring  in the
 
dosed males, and the  pigmentary intestinal changes occurring  in
 
all dosed groups were induced  by the  administration  of
 
4-amino-2-nitrophenol  under the conditions  of this bioassay.
 
D. Statistical  Analyses  of Results (Rats)
 
Tables El and E2 in  Appendix  E contain  the statistical analyses
 
of the incidences  of those primary tumors that occurred  in at
 
least two animals  of one group and at an  incidence  of at least 5%
 
in one or more than  one group.
 
In male rats,  the results  of the Cochran-Armitage  test for posi­
tive dose-related trend  in the  incidence  of transitional-cell
 
22
 carcinomas  of the urinary bladder  is significant  (P < 0.001).  A
 
departure from linear trend  is indicated  (P = 0.030),  because of
 
the relatively  steep increase  in incidence  in the  high-dose
 
group. The results  of the  Fisher exact  test show that  the
 
incidence  in the  high-dose group  is significantly  higher  (P =
 
0.018) than that  in the matched-control group.  The statistical
 
conclusion  is that the incidence  of transitional-cell carcinomas
 
of the urinary bladder  in male rats  is associated with  the
 
administration  of 4-amino-2-nitrophenol.  No tumors  of the
 
urinary bladder were found  in 220 male or 220  female historical
 
controls  at this laboratory.  The results  of the  statistical
 
tests on the  incidence  of this tumor  in female rats  are not
 
significant;  however,  transitional-cell  carcinomas  of the urinary
 
bladder were observed  in 1/43 (2%)  of the low-dose females  and
 
2/44 (5%) of the  high-dose females compared with  0/15 in the
 
control groups.
 
A significant dose-related trend  in the  negative direction  (P =
 
0.043) is observed  in the  incidence  of thyroid tumors  in male
 
rats, due to the  higher incidence  in the  control group than  in
 
the dosed groups.

 IV. RESULTS  - MICE
 
A. Body Weights  and Clinical Signs  (Mice)
 
Mean body weights  of dosed male  and female mice were only
 
slightly  lower than those  of corresponding matched controls
 
(figure 3). Fluctuation  in the  growth curve  may be due to
 
mortality;  as the  size of a group diminishes,  the mean body
 
weight may be  subject  to variation.  No other clinical signs were
 
reported.
 
B. Survival  (Mice)
 
The Kaplan  and Meier curves estimating  the probabilities  of
 
survival  for male and female mice administered  4-amino-2­
nitrophenol  in the  diet at the  doses of this bioassay, together
 
with those of the  matched  controls,  are shown in figure 4. The
 
result of the Tarone test for dose-related trend  in mortality  is
 
not significant  in either sex.
 
In male mice,  43/50 (86%) of the  high-dose group, 41/50 (82%)  of
 
the low-dose group,  and 17/20 (85%)  of the  matched-control group
 
lived to termination  of the  study. In females,  44/50 (88%) of
 
the high-dose  group, 46/50 (92%) of the  low-dose  group, and 19/20
 
(95%) of the  matched-control group survived  to termination  of the
 
study.

C. Pathology  (Mice)
 
Histopathologic  findings  on neoplasms  in mice are summarized  in
 
Appendix  B, tables Bl and B2;  findings  on nonneoplastic lesions
 
are summarized  in Appendix  D, tables Dl and D2.
 
All of the  tumors and hyperplasias  that occurred  in the mice were
 
spontaneous  types which  occurred  in approximately equal
 
incidences  in the control  and dosed groups. There  was a slight
 
increase  of hepatic adenomas  in the high-dose mice compared with
 
the controls,  but an  equal percentage  of hepatocellular
 
carcinomas  occurred  in both control  and dosed groups.
 
Several nonneoplastic changes were observed  and were considered
 
to be either spontaneous  or intercurrent disease processes.  One
 
change that occurred  in the  dosed mice  but not in the  controls
 
consisted  of deposits  of dark brown, finely granular pigment  in
 
the lamina propria  of the small intestine.  The pigment change
 
occurred in 46/49 low-dose  and 43/47 high-dose males  and in 43/48
 
low-dose and 42/47 high-dose females.  It appeared  similar  to
 
that described  in the  rats of this study with respect  to its
 
location, dose relationship,  and staining characteristics.
 
28
 The results  of the  histopathologic  examination  indicate that
 
4-amino-2-nitrophenol  was not  carcinogenic  in mice but induced
 
the deposition  of pigment  in the  lamina propria  of the  small
 
intestine under  the conditions  of this bioassay.
 
D. Statistical  Analyses  of Results (Mice)
 
Tables Fl and F2 in  Appendix  F contain  the statistical  analyses
 
of the incidences  of those primary tumors that occurred  in at
 
least two animals  of one group and at an  incidence  of at least 5%
 
in one or  more than  one group.
 
The results  of the  Cochran-Armitage  test for dose-related trend
 
and those of the  Fisher exact  test comparing  the incidences  of
 
tumors in each of the dosed groups with  that in the control group
 
are not significant  in the positive direction  in either sex.
 
Significant  results  in the negative  direction  are observed  in the
 
incidence  of alveolar/bronchiolar  carcinoma  of the  lung in male
 
mice; however, when combined incidences  of animals  with either
 
adenoma or carcinoma  of the  lungs are analyzed,  there is no
 
significant difference between control  and dosed groups.  In
 
female mice,  a significant trend  (P = 0.035) in the  negative
 
direction  in the  incidences  of follicular-cell  adenoma  or
 
papillary adenoma  of the thyroid  is observed,  but the  results  of
 
the Fisher exact tests  are not  significant.
 
29
 In each of the 95%  confidence intervals  of relative risk, shown
 
in the tables,  the value of one or  less than  one is  included;
 
this indicates  the absence  of significant positive results.  It
 
should also  be noted that each of the intervals (except that  for
 
the incidence  of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinoma  of the  lung in
 
male mice) has an upper limit greater than one, indicating  the
 
theoretical possibility  of the  induction  of tumors by 4-amino-2­
nitrophenol, which could  not be detected  under the conditions  of
 
this test.
 
30
 V. PISCUSSION
 
On the basis of rate of growth, mortality,  or other clinical
 
signs, there was little evidence  of toxicity  of 4-amino-2­
nitrophenol  in the dosed rats  or mice. Mean body weights  of the
 
female mice were only slightly lower than those  of the controls
 
throughout much  of the bioassay.  The survival  of either rats  or
 
mice was not  affected  by the  test chemical,  and at the end of the
 
bioassay,  the survival  of the animals  in dosed and control groups
 
of both the rats and the  mice was at  least 60%. Sufficient
 
numbers of animals were  at risk for the  development  of late-
appearing  tumors.  Since  both male and female mice receiving
 
4-amino-2-nitrophenol  had little or no depression  in mean weights
 
and their survival  was comparable  to controls, they  may have been
 
able to tolerate  a higher dose.
 
In rats, transitional-cell carcinomas  of the  urinary bladder
 
showed a dose-related  trend in the males (P < 0.001) and occurred
 
at a significantly  higher incidence  (P = 0.018) in the high-dose
 
males than  in the  matched-control males (controls  0/15,  low-dose
 
0/46, high-dose  11/39 [28%]).  Carcinomas  of the  bladder also
 
occurred in one low-dose  female and two  high-dose  females,  but in
 
none of the  control females. Transitional-cell  papillomas  of the
 
bladder occurred  in two  additional high-dose males,  and
 
transitional-cell hyperplasia  of the  bladder occurred  in four
 
31
 additional high-dose males,  but neither lesion occurred  in
 
control males. No tumors  of the  bladder were found among  220
 
male and 220  female historical-control Fischer  344 rats at this
 
laboratory.
 
In mice, no tumors occurred  in dosed groups  of males or females
 
at incidences that were  significantly  higher than those  in the
 
corresponding matched-control groups.
 
Deposition  of pigment occurred  in the lamina propria  of the small
 
intestine  in at least 91% of the  animals  in the dosed groups  of
 
rats and in at  least 89% of the  animals  in the  dosed groups  of
 
mice, but in none of the control groups  of either species.
 
The LD^Q of 4-amino-2-nitrophenol  in Charles River  CD rats has
 
been reported  as 3,300 mg/kg when the chemical  was administered
 
orally and 302  mg/kg when  it was  given by intraperitoneal
 
injection  (Burnett  et al., 1976; Burnett  et al., 1977). A hair
 
dye containing  the chemical caused  no embryotoxic  or teratogenic
 
effects in CD rats when it was applied  to the skin at 2 ml/kg at
 
intervals during pregnancy (Burnett  et al. , 1976) and also did
 
not induce a dominant lethal effect when  it was tested in mature
 
male CD rats by intraperitoneal injection  at a dose of 20 mg/kg
 
(Burnett  et al. , 1977). When a hair dye containing  4-amino-2­
nitrophenol  as well as Cl Acid Black  107 was  applied  to the skin
 
32
 of DBAf or A strain mice, tumors  of lymphoid  origin developed  at
 
a higher incidence  in the  DBAf strain  and at  earlier times  in
 
both strains than  in corresponding untreated controls (Venitt  and
 
Searle, 1976). Two dosed DBAf  females  developed sarcomas  of the
 
genital tract at weeks 66 and 69  (Venitt  and Searle,  1976).
 
Positive results were also obtained  when the same hair  dye
 
(Venitt and Searle, 1976)  or the  4-amino-2-nitrophenol alone
 
(Garner and Nutman, 1977)  was tested  in the  Salmonella
 
mutagenicity  test (McCann  et al., 1975).
 
It is concluded that under  the conditions  of the  bioassay,
 
4-amino-2-nitrophenol  was carcinogenic  for male Fischer  344 rats,
 
inducing transitional-cell  carcinomas  of the  urinary bladder;  the
 
transitional-cell carcinomas  of the  urinary bladder observed  in
 
three dosed female rats  may also have been associated with
 
administration  of the  4-amino-2-nitrophenol.  The test chemical
 
was not carcinogenic  for male or female B6C3F1 mice  at the doses
 
tested.

 Review of the Bioassay  of 4-Amino-2-Nitrophenol*
 
for Carcinogenicity
 
by the Data Evaluation/Risk  Assessment Subgroup  of the
 
Clearinghouse  on Environmental Carcinogens
 
April 26, 1978
 
The Clearinghouse  on Environmental Carcinogens  was
 
established  in May, 1978, in compliance with  DHEW Committee
 
Regulations  and the  Provisions  of the Federal  Advisory
 
Committee Act.  The purpose  of the Clearinghouse  is to
 
advise the Director  of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
 
on its bioassay program  to identify  and to evaluate chemical
 
carcinogens  in the environment  to which humans  may be
 
exposed.  The members  of the Clearinghouse have been drawn
 
from academia, industry, organized labor, public interest
 
groups, State health  officials,  and quasi-public health  and
 
research organizations.  Members have been selected  on the
 
basis of their experience  in carcinogenesis  or related
 
fields and, collectively, provide expertise  in chemistry,
 
biochemistry,  biostatistics,  toxicology, pathology,  and
 
epidemiology. Representatives  of various Governmental
 
agencies participate  as ad hoc  members.  The Data Evaluation/
 
Risk Assessment Subgroup  of the Clearinghouse  is charged
 
with the responsibility  of providing  a peer review  of
 
reports prepared  on NCI-sponsored bioassays  of chemicals
 
studied for carcinogenicity.  It is in  this context that
 
the below critique  is given on the bioassay  of 4-Amino-2­
Nitrophenol  for carcinogenicity.
 
The primary reviewer said that  the compound induced
 
bladder cancer  in treated male rats  and that the evidence
 
was suggestive  for a similar  effect in females.  No carcin­
ogenic effect was observed among treated mice. After  a
 
brief description  of the experimental design,  he opined that
 
the incidence  of bladder cancer  was not  dose related,  as
 
indicated  in the report.  He noted that  the compound  was
 
the only phenol  he was aware of which was (systemically)
 
carcinogenic.  Based on the relatively  low incidence  of
 
bladder cancer and long latent period,  the primary  reviewer
 
concluded  that-the  compound  did not  pose a carcinogenic
 
risk to humans.
 
The secondary reviewer agreed with  the conclusion that
 
the compound  was carcinogenic  in rats. He said that  a
 
conclusion  on the carcinogenicity  of il-Amino-2-Nitrophenol
 
in mice could  not be made since  it appeared that  a maximum
 
tolerated dose  was not  achieved.  Had higher doses been
 
99
 administered,  the elevated incidence  of liver tumors  in
 
treated male mice  may have increased  to a statistically
 
significant number.  The secondary reviewer concluded
 
that 4-Amino-2-Nitrophenol  poses a carcinogenic risk  to
 
humans.
 
A Subgroup member disagreed with  the primary  reviewer's
 
conclusion  with respect  to human risk. Unlike  the results
 
of this study,  the primary reviewer argued that human
 
carcinogens  induce a high yield  of cancer in a relatively
 
short time in experimental animals.
 
In response  to a question,  a Program staff pathologist
 
said that the presence  of bladder calculi  in the rats were
 
not noted by the testing  laboratories'  pathologists.  In
 
his experience,  he added, bladder parasites have  not been
 
found in rats used  in bioassay studies.  It was  noted that
 
only one of the  bladder tumors  metastasized.  The Program
 
staff pathologist continued that  the finding  was not  unusual
 
since bladder tumors normally  do not metastasize  even when
 
induced by strong carcinogens.  A Subgroup member suggested
 
that the conclusion  on the carcinogenicity  of 4-Amino-2­
Nitrophenol should  be qualified, since  the urine was not
 
analyzed  for crystals.
 
A motion was approved unanimously that  the report
 
on the bioassay  of 4-Amino-2-Nitrophenol  be accepted  as
 
written.

Louise Strong, University  of Texas Health Sciences Center
 
John Weisburger, American Health Foundation
 
(Sidney Wolfe, Health Research Group, submitted  a written review)
 
Subsequent  to this review, changes  may have been made
 
in the bioassay report either  as a result of the review
 
or other reasons.  Thus, certain comments  and criticisms
 
reflected  in the review may no longer be appropriate.
