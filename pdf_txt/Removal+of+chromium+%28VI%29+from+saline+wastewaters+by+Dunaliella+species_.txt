 Abstract:  1 
Hexavalent chromium compounds such as chromate and dichromate, commonly designated as Cr (VI) compounds, 2 
are widely used heavy metals in different industries and are considered highly toxic to most life forms. 3 
Unfortunately , they have become a ma jor pollutant of groundwater  and rivers around dichromate using industries. 4 
Bioremediation is widely used to decrease  the amount of dichromate in wastewater but requires large amounts of 5 
precious fresh water. Here we tested two marine micro -algal species, Phaeodactylum tricornutum  strain CCY0033 6 
and Navicula pelliculosa  strain CCMP543, for their ability of dichromate bioremediation and concomitantly 7 
producing lipids that can serve as biofuel. Dichromate tolerance of the strains was investigated under differ ent 8 
growth condition s in order to obtain high biomass yields, high lipid accumulation and high dichromate removal from 9 
the medium. Both algal strains gr ew well and produce d high biomass in media containing up to 1 mg of dichromate 10 
per liter. Variations in growth condition s revealed that dichromate removal from the medium correlate d positively 11 
with biomass yield. Dichromate removal using living cells was in the same order of magnitude as with autoclaved 12 
dead cells or when using extracted extracellular polyme ric substances (EPS) . This suggest s biosorption  of 13 
dichromate to cell-associated  polymeric substances as the major mechanism of the bioremediation process. For both 14 
strains, o ptimal dichromate removal and lipid production were achieved at a light intensity  of 55 μmol m-2s-1 and at a 15 
sodium nitrate concentration of 3 mM. The optimal temperature for dichromate removal and lipid production was 23 16 
°C for P. tricornutum  and 27 °C for N. pelliculosa . Compared to P. tricornutum  strain CCY0033, N. pelliculosa  17 
strain CCMP543  produced an overall higher lipid yield  under these conditions . 18

1. Introduction  23 
Chromium exists in three major forms in nature: the uncharged metallic form (Cr), a trivalent form (Cr (III )) and a 24 
hexavalent form (Cr (VI)) (Greenwood and Earnshaw, 1997) . Chromium has several important industrial 25 
applications such as in the leather industry, chrome plating, textile manufacturing, and steel industry (U.S. 26 
Department of Health and Human Servic es, 2008) . Cr and Cr (III) are considered nontoxic and non -carcinogenic or 27 
possess only low toxicity. Moreover, in trace concentrations, Cr (III) is even an essential element for life (Straif et 28 *Manuscript

 al., 2009; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,  2016 ). Cr (VI) , however , is classified as a human 29 
carcinogen (Straif et al., 2009)  and is toxic to animals (Velma et al., 2009) , plants (Shanker et al., 2005)  and 30 
microorganisms (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2012; Petrilli and De Flora, 19 77; Wong and 31 
Trevors, 1988; Yao et al., 2008) . An estimated  50 to 80 % of all plant and algal species are negatively affected by Cr 32 
concentrations exceeding 100 µg /L (Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines, 2017) . Toxic concentrations of Cr 33 
(VI) for micr oalgae varied from 1 µg /L for the diatom Thalassiosira  pseudonana  to up to 10 mg /L for a Chlorella  34 
sp. (Wong and Trevors, 1988) . Cr (VI) toxicity affect s microorganisms in pure cultures (Petrilli and De Flora, 1977)  35 
as well as in natural microbial communit ies. Increasing the concentration of Cr  (VI) resulted in decreas ed microbial 36 
activity (Yao et al., 2008) .  37 
Many ecosystems and surface - and groundwaters are polluted by heavy metals including Cr (VI), mostly in the form 38 
of chromate (CrO 42-) or dichromate ( Cr2O72-) (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2012) , in which 39 
Cr (VI) concentrations rang e from 0.5 mg /L to up to 20 mg /L (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 40 
2012; Zhitkovich, 2011) . In 1991, the United States Environmental Pro tection Agency (US -EPA) has set the 41 
maximum allowable contamination level for total chromium at 100 ppb (100 µg /L). In a 2014 revision, the 42 
acceptable contamination level was decreased  to 10 ppb (10 µg /L) and is aim ing at a public health goal to reach 0.02  43 
ppb (20 ng /L) (Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines, 2017; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease 44 
Registry, 2012; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2016) . This has led to the development of various 45 
abiotic and biological approaches for th e treatment of wastewater  or ecosystems in order to eliminate Cr (IV) 46 
contamina tion (Barrera -Díaz et al., 2012) . Bioremediation uses autochthonous or introduced living organisms, often 47 
microorganisms, algae , or plants in order to remove or detoxify contami nants. While plants, heterotrophic bacteria , 48 
and fungi have been widely used in bioremediation of Cr (VI) contaminated sites, the potential of applying 49 
phototrophic microorganisms has received much less attention (Barrera -Díaz et al., 2012) . This is surpri sing because 50 
just as plants, microalgae and cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic and harvest sunlight energy , which would 51 
decrease process costs and could therefore  be commercially attractive. In addition, microalgae and some 52 
cyanobacteria are known to accum ulate lipids and hence their biomass can be used for the development of so -called 53 
third -generation biofuels. These organisms, in addition to their bioremediation capacities , can be grown on non - 54 
arable land and when choosing marine or salt -adapted organisms , competition with food production and the use of 55 
precious freshwater could be avoided (Sharma et al., 2012) . Furthermore, biosorption using extracellular polymeric 56  1

 substances (EPS) is one of the major mechanism s of heavy metal bioremediation by microalgae  and cyanobacteria, 57 
and it would therefore  be possible to recover metals such as Cr  (IV) from the se biosorbents (Sen and Dastidar, 58 
2010) .  59 
Bacillariophyta  (diatoms) comprise a large and diverse group of microalgae that are widespread in aquatic 60 
ecosystems.  They are often the dominant group of eukaryotic phytoplankton and are responsible for 40 -45% of the 61 
primary production in the ocean  (Sarthou et al., 2005; Smetacek, 1999) . Moreover, diatoms are key to a worldwide 62 
algae-based bioeconomy  that is used for fo od, feedstock , and biofilm production (Laurens et al., 2017) . There have 63 
been many applications using  diatom s including bioremediation  of heavy metals  (Bozarth et al., 2009; Pereira et al., 64 
2011) . Moreover, several strains of d iatoms are known to possess n atural high contents of neutral lipids that can be 65 
converted into biodiesel (Zhu et al., 2016) . 66 
This study aim ed at the use of diatoms to combine the sequestration of toxic chromium (VI) and the optimization of 67 
lipid accumulation for biofuel production. Fo r this, we have used two species, Phaeodactylum  tricornutum  and 68 
Navicula  pelliculosa . These benthic diatoms have been shown to be oleaginous (produce lipid) and produce high 69 
amounts of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS ) while growing at low silicate concentration (Coombs et al., 70 
1967; Kaur, 2014; Lewin, 1955) . By varying the culturing parameters , we optimized growth  yield , chromium 71 
removal , and lipid production.  72 
 73 
2. Materials and methods  74 
2.1 Organism s and culture conditions  75 
The diatoms, P. tricornutum  CCY0033, isolated from an intertidal sediment from the North Sea beach of the Dutch 76 
barrier island Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, and N. pelliculosa  CCMP543/CCY0399, originally isolated from 77 
Oyster Pond, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts USA, were obtai ned from the Culture Collection Yerseke (CCY), 78 
Royal Netherlands Institute of Sea Research. Cultures were grown in MDV medium (Supplementary material) 79 
containing 6 mM nitrate and 150 µM silicate in 250 mL polystyrene tissue culture flask (TTP, 90026, Switz erland). 80 
To 92 m L of fresh medium, 8 m L (8% v/v) of an actively growing , 3 weeks old pre -culture was added. The cultures 81 
were incubated at 14 °C and 55 μmol m-2s-1 light (photon flux density) at a 16 -8 h light -dark regime.  The pH of the 82 
media was adjusted  at 7±0.2.  These conditions are hereafter called “standard growth condit ions”. Culturing was 83  1

 always performed in triplicate and the growth was followed by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) 84 
using s terile MDV medium as a blank.  85 
 86 
2.2 Chromium (VI) tolerance  87 
To determine Cr (VI) tolerance, both diatoms were grown as  described above in MDV medium containing Cr (VI) 88 
in the form of potassium dichromate K 2Cr2O7 at final concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 mg /L. Growth was 89 
assessed by end-point measuring the optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600)) after 15 days of incubation.  90 
 91 
2.3 Analysis of dichromate concentration  92 
Residual Cr (VI) in the medium after biosorption was assayed  using a colorimetric test upon reaction with diphenyl 93 
carbazide (DPC) according to recommendations by the American Public Health Association (APHA Method  3500 - 94 
Cr: Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater  (chromium) , 1989 and 1996)  and the 95 
microalgae samples were prepared as described by Dönmez and Aksu (2002) . The samples were centrifuged for 15 96 
min at 5 ,000 rcf before adding DPC to  the supernatant . Hexavalent chromium concentration was determined by 97 
measuring the colorimetric at 540 nm using v arious concentration of Cr (VI) (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mg /L) in 98 
sterile MDV medium as calibration  curve.  99

2.4 Evaluation of heat-killed  P. tricornutum  and N. pelliculosa  for chromium removal  101 
To establish potential modes of chromium removal (enzymatic versus passive biosorption ), chromium removal by 102 
living cells were compared with removal with heat-killed diatom  cells. Diatoms were grown for 15  days in Cr (VI) - 103 
free MDV medium (100 m L) and killed by autoclaving for 20 min at 121 °C. After cooling down , the 100 m L of 104 
heat-killed cells were transferred to a dialysis tube (3 kDa cut -off) and placed in a sterile flask (Blue Cap Screw Cap 105 
bottle, 500 mL, DURAN) containing 100 m L sterile MDV. Filter steril ized Cr (VI) was added to the medium at a  106 
final concentration of 1 mg /L and incubated under standard growth conditions  while stirring with a magnetic bar at 107 
150 rpm. Incubation was maintained for 3 day s to establish an equilibrium in Cr  (VI) concentration and the residual 108 
hexavalent chromium concentration in the external medium was determined as described above.  109

 EPS i s abundantly produced by both diatom species and can be present as colloidal molecules suspended in the 112 
medium or attached to the cells (Staats et al., 1999) . Extraction of both EPS fractions was carried out according to 113 
Staats et al. (1999)  with slight mo difications. Non -attached EPS was separated from the cells in both diatom cultures 114 
(100 m L) by centrifugation at 20,000 rcf (15 min and 10°C). The loosely bound attached -EPS fraction was extracted 115 
from the cell pellet by resuspending it in 5 m L of sterile MDV  medium  and incubat ed for 1 h at 30 °C in a shaking 116 
water bath. Subsequently, the suspension was centrifuged at room temperature for 30 min at 20,000 rcf and the 117 
supernatant was combined with the non -attached  EPS-containing supernatant from the previous  step. Instead of 118 
precipitating the EPS , we followed Sharma et al. (2008)  using EPS for heavy metal bioremediation . Briefly,  the 119 
collected cell -free culture  supernatant  containing the EPS was filter sterilized (0.2 µm filters, cellulose acetate 120 
membrane, V MR, 514 -0061), subsequently freeze -dried in a sterile bottle , and stored at -20 ºC until further use. For 121 
chromium biosorption  testing, the freeze -dried EPS (extracted from 100 m L culture) was dissolved in 20 mL of 122 
sterile MilliQ water and put into a dialy sis tube (3 kDa cut -off). The dialysis tube was placed in a flask containing 123 
70 m L sterile MilliQ water then the volume was adjusted to 100 m L and filter sterilized Cr (VI) was added at a final 124 
concentration of 1 mg /L. The flasks with the EPS -containing di alysis tube were incubated under standard cultivation 125 
condition with mild s haking at 150 rpm. After 3 days the residual hexavalent chromium concentration in the 126 
medium was determined as described above.  127 
 128 
2.6 Lipid measurement  129 
The lipid accumulation in diat om cells was visualized using the fluorescent stain 4,4 -difluoro -1,3,5,7 -tetramethyl -4- 130 
bora-3a,4a -diaza -s-indacene (BODIPY 505/515; Invitrogen). The lipid content was measured using the sulfo - 131 
phospho -vanillin (SPV) assay (Mishra et al., 2014) . Calibration was done with triolein (Sigma) as standard. The 132 
lipid concentration in the culture was expressed as µg triolein/ mL. 133 
 134 
2.7 Variation in growth condition of the diatoms  135 
The effect of different growth conditions on biomass production, lipid production , and chromium bioremediation 136 
was investigated . These included different culture media, temperature, light intensity, nitrogen source  and - 137 
concentration, silicate depletion , the presence of azide, and long vs short -term exposure  to Cr  (VI). 138

 2.8 Statistics  140 
The resu lts were statistically analy zed using a one way ANOVA and testing the significance  of the variance using 141 
Tukey's Honest Significant Difference ( TukeyHSD ). Both ANOVA and TukeyHSD  were performed using the core 142 
R code ( R Core Team,  2017). All experiments wer e performed in triplicate and p-values < 0.05 were considered 143 
significant.  144 
 145 
3. Results and discussion  146 
Different growth conditions were applied in order to test whether the diatoms P. tricornutum  and N. pelliculosa  are 147 
potential candidates for bioremediat ion and concomitantly accumulate high amounts of neutral lipids, which could 148 
be used as a resource for biofuels. For efficient Cr (VI) removal and obtaining high lipid yields, it is essential to 149 
maintain a relatively high biomass and only cultures with an OD600 > 0.2 were considered for further analysis.  150 
For establishing the optimal condition for the aforementioned  goals, several growth factors were tested in media 151 
containing 1 mg /L Cr (VI). The diatom s were grown in the presence of 1 mg /L of Cr (VI), in di fferent artificial 152 
seawater  media (MDV, ASNIII , and T+), different temperatures (14, 18, 23, 27, 30, and 37 °C), different light 153 
intensities (30, 55, and 80 μmol m-2s-1), different nitrogen sources (nitrate, nitrite, urea, and ammonium nitrate) at 154 
different concentrations (0, 0.6, 3, 4.5, 6 and 7.5 mM ), and silicate concentration  (1.5 and 150 µM). Furthermore, 155 
the cultures were treated by the respiratory inhibitor, sodium azide, at 0, 10, 25, 50, 100 µM. The effect of long - or 156 
short -term exposure to Cr (VI) was tested in cultures that were grown for 15  days in the presence of 1 mg /L Cr (VI) 157 
and cultures that were grown without Cr (VI)  and subsequently exposed for 24 h to 1 mg /L Cr (VI).  158 
 159 
3.1 Tolerance of P. tricornutum  and N. pelliculosa  to Cr (VI)  and their potential to remov e it  160 
The diatoms revealed tolerance to Cr (VI) up to 1 mg/m L (Table  1). At concentrations of 5 and 10 mg /L the growth 161 
yield was considerabl y lower, even though N. pelliculosa  appeared to be less susceptible. The biomass -normalized 162 
Cr (VI) removal was highest at 1 mg/m L. Both strain s removed up to 30 -35% of the added Cr (VI) (Fig. 1A & B). 163 
At 5 mg Cr (VI) /L, N. pelliculosa  removed 20% albeit at a lower standing stock of biomass. At higher Cr (VI) 164 
concentrations the biomass was too low to obtain a significant Cr removal  (Table 1).  Hence, for application of the 165 
tested diatom strains for treatment of contaminated water the concentration of Cr (VI) should not exceed 1mg /L. 166 
Subsequent experiments were therefore performed at 1 mg /L. 167  1

 In general , hexavalent chromium is considered toxic and ca rcinogen . For human purposes (e.g. drinking water) the 168 
maximum allowable concentration has been  set at 10 ppb (10µg /L) and EPA aims  to decrease it even further to less 169 
than 0.02 ppb (20 ng /L) for public health (Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines, 2017; Agency for Toxic 170 
Substances and Disease Registry, 2012; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2016) . Moreover, Cr (VI) 171 
has been shown to be highly toxic and non -essential for microalgae and bacteria, although some strains have shown 172 
some level o f resistan ce to Cr (VI) (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2012; Cervantes et al., 173 
2001; Wong and Trevors, 1988) . The toxic concentration depends on the  species and ranges from 1 µg /L for the 174 
estuarine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana , 20 µg /L for Chlorella pyrenoidosa , 150 µg /L for Ulothrix fimbriata  up 175 
to 98 0 µg/L for Skeletonema costatum . Few microalga l species have been  reported to resist concentrations higher 176 
than 1 mg /L (Riedel, 1984; Wong and Trevors, 1988) . Moreover, when adding 0.4 m g/L chromium to a natural 177 
community, the composition shifted in dominance from diatoms to green microalgae and cyanobacteria , indicating a 178 
higher susceptibili ty of diatoms to Cr (VI) (Patrick, 1978) . Previous studies reported that exposure of N. pelliculos a 179 
or P. tricornutum to heavy metals such as chromate resulted in a significant decrease or a complete inhibition of 180 
growth (Gabbasova et al., 2017; Irving et al., 2009) . Gabbasova et al. (2017)  studied the effect of Cr  (VI) on diatoms 181 
and reported that the biomass yield  of P. tricornutum  at 2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 25  mg/L Cr (VI)  was 60, 45 , 25, 20 , and 182 
10% of the control , respectively . This is in agreement with our study in which 1 mg /L Cr (VI) had no effect on the 183 
biomass yield of  P. tricornutum,  while 5 and 1 0 mg /L Cr (VI) resulted in a decrease of 60 -80% (Table 1 ). This 184 
confirms  that the negative effects of Cr  (VI) on growth and photosynthesis of P. tricornutum  starts in the 185 
concentration range  of 1-2.5 mg /L dichromate.  The mechanism underlying the different sensitivity to Cr in 186 
microalgae remains to be clarified, yet some suggestions have been made to explain it such as interference with the 187 
cell cycle, inhibition of respiration  and/or photosynthesis, or loss of motility (Cervantes et al., 2001) . Gabbasova et  188 
al. (2017) found that chromate may inhibit photosystem II of P. tricornutum . Riedell (1984) proposed that chromium 189 
toxicity in diatoms is caused by competition with sulfate. Because the concentration of sulfate in our media was high 190 
(23 mM) it might  expla in the relative ly low toxicity of chromium in the marine diatoms we investigated . 191

3.2 Optimizing growth  193 
Both strains were tested for growth on three different media, the standard MDV, T+ , and ASNIII  media . The h ighest  194 
OD 600 value was obtained when growing  on the standard MDV medium (Table 1). T+ medium yielded only slightly 195  1

 lower biomass compared to MDV but ASNIII  decreased the growth yield by nearly 50% and 65% in P. tricornutum  196 
and N. pelliculosa , respectively. The diatoms for subsequent experiments were  therefore cultured in MDV medium. 197 
The nitrogen source of all three media was NaNO 3 at a concentration of 6 mM and all three contain ing 150 µM 198 
silicate to support frustule production by diatoms. However, there are several differences between the three medi a 199 
with regards to the ir ingredients (Mg, Ca, K, P, S, carbonate, trace element and supplementary vitamin mix) and 200 
their respective concentration s (supplementary material)  that may affect the growth yield . The two prominent 201 
differences between MDV and T+ ve rsus ASNIII are that the first two contain a  supplementary vitamin mix and 202 
higher carbonate  concentrations  (~10 times). Previous studies demonstrated that both factors can stimulate  higher 203 
biomass production by microalgae (Danesh et al., 2018; Eppley, 1977 ; Lohman et al., 2015) .  204 
Increasing the growth temperature to 23 °C  and 27 °C for respectively  P. tricornutum  and N. pelliculosa  resulted in 205 
an increase in biomass (Table 1). Above these temperatures  the diatoms did not grow. The biomass increased with 206 
approximately 0.1 OD 600 units at their maximum growth temperature relative to  the routinely applied growth 207 
temperature of  14 °C.  208 
For P. tricornutum , increasing the light intensity from 30 to 50 μmol m-2s-1 and from 50 to 80 μmol m-2s-1 showed no 209 
significant change in OD 600, however , comparing light intensity at 30 to 80 μmol m-2s-1 showed a slight decrease in 210 
biomass. At 30 μmol m-2s-1 the biomass was approximately 0.05 to 0.06 OD 600 units higher. For N. pelliculosa there 211 
was no significant difference in biomass yield at any of the tested light intensities.  212 
Previous studies demonstrated that the type of nitrogen source could significantly affect growth yield and lipid 213 
production in microalgae. For example, while sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite can stimulate growth in many 214 
microalgal species, non -toxic ammonium (NH 4+) can dissociate to the more toxic form of ammonia (NH 3) (Qiao et 215 
al., 2016; Sharma et al ., 2012; Zhu et al., 2016) . The standard medium contains nitrate (6 mM). The same 216 
concentration of nitrite did not affect growth  of P. tricornutum  and N. pelliculosa . Urea did not affect growth  of P. 217 
tricornutum  but decreased the growth yield of N. pellicu losa. Ammonium nitrate decreased the growth yield by 0.15 218 
OD 600 units for N. pelliculosa , while P. tricornutum  did not grow very well on this nitrogen source (Table 1). Use of 219 
either 6 mM nitrate or nitrite is possible but ammonium at this concentration ap pears to be toxic  (Admiraal, 1977)  220 
due to pH effects (Fidalgo Paredes et al., 1995) . Although urea has not been reported to be as toxic as ammonia, 221 
previous studies demonstrate d a toxic effect at high  concentration s (Admiraal, 1977; Yongmanitchai and Ward,  222 
1991) .  223  1

 Growth yield of both strains is furthermore positively correlated with NaNO 3 concentration. Without NaNO 3 growth 224 
halted. P. tricornutum  and N. pelliculosa  required respectively at least 3 mM and 4.5 mM nitrate for highest  growth 225 
yield. Higher conc entrations of NaNO 3 did not further increase the growth yield (Table 1).  226 
Another  important nutrient for diatoms is silicate , essential for the formation of their frustules (Coombs et al., 1967) . 227 
The effect of silicate concentration was combined with diffe rent concentrations of NaNO 3 (Table 1). S ilicate 228 
deprivation had no significant growth effect on P. tricornutum  and decreased growth yield only at low NaNO 3 (0.6 229 
mM). In contrast, the growth  yield of N. pelliculosa  was dramatically decreased (to ~0.1 OD 600 units) independent 230 
on the concentration of NaNO 3. At 150 µM silicate, growth yield of N. pelliculosa  was ~0.27 OD 600 units at 0.6 mM 231 
NaNO 3 and was higher at 3 and 6 mM NaNO 3. N. pelliculosa  obviously requires silicate for growth. This species  is 232 
known to be sensitive to silicate deprivation. Without silicate , the growth  of N. pelliculosa  ceases and cell 233 
metabolism is restricted to maintenance until silicate becomes available  (Coombs et al., 1967) . In contrast, P. 234 
tricornutum is the only reported diatom spe cies so far, that grow s well  without silicate (Lewin, 1958) . P. 235 
tricornutum has a unique morphological plasticity and only forms a silicified frustule in its oval form. This 236 
morphology is mostly found in intertidal sediments and is essential for gliding mo tility and general stress resistance 237 
(Borowitzka and Volcani, 1978; De Martino et al., 2007) . In liquid medium  frustules are not formed  by P. 238 
tricornutum . 239

3.3 Effect of growth condition on Cr  (IV) bioremediation  241 
3.3.1 The role of extracellular polymeric s ubstances (EPS) in dichromate removal  242 
The mechanism of Cr removal in P. tricornutum and N. pelliculosa is not precisely known . In general , removal of 243 
heavy metals such as dissolved Cr (VI) from the medium could be through sequestration, either by e.g. act ive uptake 244 
by the cells or by biosorption  to (extracellular) substances produced by the cells , or by enzymatic reduction of the 245 
compound (Mantzorou et al., 2018; Perales -Vela et al., 2006) . However, previous studies suggest that biosorption  to 246 
extracellula r materials produced by the microorganisms (such as phytochelatins) is an important mechanism for 247 
bioremediation of heavy metals by microalgae including diatoms such as P. tricornutum  (Bertrand and Poirier, 248 
2005; Cassin et al., 2018; Morelli and Scarano, 2 001; Mota et al., 2016; Perales -Vela et al., 2006; Richards and 249 
Mullins, 2013) . 250  1

 In order to determine the underlying mechanism (enzymatic reduction, active uptake , or biosorption ), chromium 251 
removal by living diatoms was compared with heat -killed (autoclave d) cell suspensions (Okeke, 2008) . The living 252 
cultures of P. tricornutum and N. pelliculosa removed up to 30 -35% Cr (VI) (Fig. 2A  & B) . However , when the 253 
autoclaved cell suspensions were exposed for three days (to ensure equilibrium) to 1 mg /L of Cr (VI) , the amount of 254 
Cr (VI) removed was 76% and 72% of the removal by living cultures of P. tricornutum and N. pelliculosa , 255 
respectively (Table 2). The positive correlation of Cr (VI) removal with biomass, the removal of Cr (VI) by heat- 256 
killed  cells, and the dif ference in removal after short or long time exposure all suggest a minimal contribution of 257 
metabolism -dependent Cr (VI) (active uptake and enzymatic reduction ) to the bioremediation process , and that Cr 258 
(VI) removal is rather caused by biosorption (Okeke, 2008; Okeke et al., 2008) . 259 
Biosorption  to the EPS would be a possibility to immobilize toxic metal ions (Cassin et al., 2018; Mantzorou et al., 260 
2018; Pereira et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2008) . Since EPS is continuously produced and a part of it is release d into 261 
the environment, toxic metal ions may be immobilized for the long term  (Mota et al., 2016) . To test whether EPS 262 
from P. tricornutum and N. pelliculosa  is capable of binding Cr (VI), EPS was extracted from the diatom cultures 263 
and tested for chromium removal. The experiment was performed in accordance to Sharma et al. (2008)  and 264 
chromium removal was measured after 3 days. Although extraction may change the conformation of the EPS, 265 
previous studies demonstrated that the extracted EPS still retain its he avy metal biosorption  capacity (Mota et al., 266 
2016; Sharma et al., 2008) . Our result s show that for P. tricornutum EPS, the amount of Cr (VI) removed was 32% 267 
and 24% of the removal by dead and live cells, respectively, and for N. pelliculosa  EPS, these numb ers were 268 
respectively  37% and 27 % (Table 2). This indicates that EPS play s a major role in the bioremoval process.  269 
Bioremediation through  binding to EPS may be  attributed to  phytochelatins (Cassin et al., 2018; Mantzorou et al., 270 
2018)  but may also be  the result of  the presence of negatively charged groups that bind the positively charged 271 
metallic ions (Mota et al., 2016) . Carboxyl, hydroxyl, phosphoryl, sulfhydryl, and amino functional groups have 272 
been reported to be involved in the metal binding process, depending on the copiousness, accessibility and chemical 273 
state of the sites, and on the affinity between the metal and biosorption  sites of the EPS (De Philippis et al., 2011) . 274 
Moreover, Mota et al. (2016) argued that hexavalent chromium ion has a 6 valenc e positive charge and therefore has 275 
a strong affinity for binding to EPS. Although other positively charged metal ions are present in MDV medium, it 276 
has been argued that some heavy metal cations such as Cr (VI) are capable of replacing others that are boun d to EPS 277 
through a cation exchange (Irving et al., 2009; Mota et al., 2016) .  278  1

 Chromium removal normalized to OD 600 under the different cultivation conditions varied between 30% and 40 % 279 
per OD600 unit (Fig . 2A & B, panels a -h). In the short term vs long te rm exposure experiment , the effect of 15 280 
versus 1 day exposure to 1 mg Cr (V) /L was compared. For both strains, short exposure led to a 20 to 25% Cr (VI) 281 
bioremediation compared to the 40% that was observed after 15 days incubation and this was independent  of the 282 
amount of NaNO 3 (3 versus 6 mM) used in this experiment.  283 
For improving Cr (VI) removal we  investigated several growth conditions . Compared to the standard growth 284 
condition s only increasing temperature  from 14o to 23o (P. tricornutum ) and 27oC (N. pelliculosa ) improved Cr (VI) 285 
removal , while  other growth parameters , including lower light intensity, using ammonium nitrate as nitrogen source, 286 
lower nitrate concentration, or silicate  limitation  (N. pelliculosa ) in fact affect ed Cr (VI) removal  negative ly (Fig. 1). 287 
Sodium azide at the tested concentrations did not change biomass yield nor chromium bioremediation. This 288 
indicate s that the amount of biomass appeared to be important for chromium removal . Growth parameters that led to 289 
a higher biomass also favored  chromium bioremediation but conditions that decreased biomass yield affected 290 
chromium removal  in a negative  way. 291 
  292 
3.4 Assessing and optimization of lipid production in the presence of chromium (VI)  293 
Cultures were analy zed for their lipid content when  grown in the presence of 1 mg /L Cr (VI). Biomass -normalized 294 
lipid content  under standard growth conditions in the absence of Cr  (VI) was ~40 µg triolein/ OD 600 unit for P. 295 
tricornutum and ~ 30 µg triolein/ OD 600 unit for N. pelliculosa . Addition of Cr (VI ) at 1 mg /L to P. tricornutum 296 
cultures and in 1 – 5 mg /L to N. pelliculosa  cultures did not significantly affect OD 600 normalized lipid production.  297 
Lipid production in N. pelliculosa  and P. tricornutum responded in the same way to the growth condition s. 298 
Differences were only associated with  conditions whe n the growth  of one of the two diatoms was impaired. Lipid 299 
content in cultures of P. tricornutum was negligibly higher when grown in T+ medium but significantly lower in 300 
ASN (III) relative to MDV (Fig . 2A &  B panel b). Previous studies on lipid production by microalgae demonstrated 301 
that presence of vitamin mix in the medium (in our study MDV and T+ medium) not only supported higher biomass 302 
production but also it led to higher lipid  accumulation  (Danesh et al ., 2018; Lohman et al., 2015) . 303 
Increasing the growth temperature of the P. tricornutum cultures from 14 to 23 °C resulted in a 43% increase in lipid 304 
accumulation . For N. pelliculosa , which  grew at its highest  rate at 27 °C a nearly 300 % increase in lipid content was 305 
observed relative to 14 °C grown cells , from 29 to 114 µg triolein/ OD 600 unit. 306  1

 Biomass and lipid accumulation  exponentially increase with temperature (Sharma et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2016) . 307 
During growth , cells accumulate little lipid but this changes during the  stationary phase when lipid accumulate s to a 308 
high amount (Sharma et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2016) . Previous studies argued that a faster growth rate means a higher 309 
biomass production and, hence,  a higher  rate of nutrient (nitrogen) consumption . This leads to nitrogen depletion  310 
trigger ing a  higher lipid accumulation  (KaiXian and Borowitzka, 1993; Zhu et al., 2016) . Our results suggest  that 311 
nutrition limitation (most likely nitrate limitation) probably happens faster at 23 and 27°C and whe n the initial 312 
nitrogen (nitrate) concentration was 3 mM . Under these conditions, P. tricornutum  and N. pelliculosa  produce d 313 
sufficient  biomass containing a higher amount of lipid compared to standard conditions (Fig. 2).  314 
Different microalgae species achie ve their highest lipid content at different light intensities , which is due to their 315 
difference in light use efficiencies (Zhu et al., 2016) . Limiting light or too high intensit ies may hinder the growth of 316 
microalgae . Low light intensit ies result in low biomass yield  and lipid accumulation  (Sharma et al., 2012; Vitova et 317 
al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016) , while  high light intensity may cause photoinhibition, damages the photosystems and 318 
therefore results in a lower lipid accumulation (KaiXian and Borowitzka, 199 3; Sharma et al., 2012; Vitova et al., 319 
2015; Zhu et al., 2016) . 320 
In our study , we showed that maintaining light intensity at 55 μmol m-2s-1 or higher is essential to maintain lipid 321 
accumulation . In comparison, at 30 µmol  m-2s-1 lipid accumulation  is decreased by more than 50% in P. tricornutum 322 
and with 25% in N. pelliculosa , while increasing the light intensity to 80 μmol m-2s-1 had no effect on lipid 323 
accumulation. Increased lipid content in P. tricornutum  has been  reported in response to increasing light in tensities 324 
(KaiXian and Borowitzka, 1993; Zhu et al., 2016) .  325 
The source of nitrogen  (sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, urea, and ammonium nitrate) was not important for  the 326 
biomass normalized lipid production (Fig. 2 A & B, panel e), while decreasing the NaN O3 concentration increased 327 
the biomass -normalized lipid content dramatically  (Fig. 2 A & B, panel f). A nearly 1100% increase in biomass - 328 
normalized lipid content was found in P. tricornutum when grown at 0.6 mM NaNO 3, resulting in a lipid content of 329 
663 µg  triolein/1 OD600 units. For N. pelliculosa , a more than 400% increase to 517 µg triolein/1 OD600 units was 330 
found at 0.6 mM NaNO 3 relatively to cultures that were grown at 6 mM nitrate . However, despite the higher lipid 331 
content, the total biomass of cultur es growing at 0.6 mM decreased  by more than 50% . Nutrient starvation is known 332 
as the most successful and widely used strategy to enhance lipid productivity. Increasing sodium nitrate 333 
concentration significantly enhanced biomass production by P. tricornutum  and resulted in decreased lipid 334  1

 content/biomass (Yodsuwan et al., 2017)  and using low nitrogen concentrations results in  a dramatic decrease of 335 
biomass, but with high lipid content (KaiXian and Borowitzka, 1993) .  336 
In this study , the desirable condition is  a trade -off between a high lipid content and a good  chromium bioremoval. 337 
Three  mM nitrate and 23 and 27 °C for P. tricornutum  and N. pelliculosa, respectively, shorte ned the  time to the 338 
stationary phase and nutrition (nitrogen) limitation trigger ing lipid accumulation , while  sufficient chromium 339 
biosorption occurred .  340 
 341 
4. Conclusion  342 
Compared to other microorganism s, microalgae and cyanobacteria are not exceptional for their bioremediation 343 
capacities, but they have several attributes that make  them an intere sting an d advantageous alternative for 344 
bioremediation . They are  the primary producer s in many ecosystems and many strains grow in marine and brackish 345 
habitats. This avoids the requirement of fresh water and arable land for biotechnological applications. Th ese 346 
organisms  can even be used for multiple purposes such as combining heavy metal bioremediation and lipid 347 
production (Perales -Vela et al., 2006; Richards and Mullins, 2013; Wilde and Benemann, 1993) . These features 348 
raised an increasing  interest in the use of these  photo trophic  microorganisms for biotechnological applications, 349 
including bioremediation.  350 
We showed that P. tricornutum and N. pelliculosa  not only produce d sufficient  biomass  and accumulated large 351 
amounts of lipid but are also capable of biorem ediation of hexavalent chromium at concentrations toxic for human 352 
(1 mg /L). The positive correlation of Cr (VI) removal with biomass, effective removal in heat-inactivated  cells and 353 
the difference in removal after short or long time exposure and biosorptio n of chromium cations by extracted EPS 354 
hinted to a cell biosorption  mechanism with EPS capture as the main  mechanism used by the two strains for 355 
bioremediation process.  356 
The chromium bioremoval  capacity of these strains was correlated  to the amount of biom ass. Biomass production 357 
was enhanced at an increased  temperature . However , a high lipid content that was triggered by nutrient (nitrogen) 358 
depletion  was not in favor  of a high biomass production and consequently Cr bioremediation.  Cr removal and lipid 359 
accum ulation by these strains require  optim ization of the  growth conditions in order to achieve both  goals . 360
