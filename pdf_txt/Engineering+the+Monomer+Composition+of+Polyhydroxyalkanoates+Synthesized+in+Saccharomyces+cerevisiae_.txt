Abstract: Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) provide biodegradable and bio-based alternatives to conventional plastics. Incorporation
of 2-hydroxy acid monomers into polymer, in addition to 3-hydroxy acids, offers possibility to tailor the polymer properties. In this
study, poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) and copolymer P(LA-3HB) were produced and characterized for the first time in the yeast Saccha-
romyces cerevisiae . Expression of engineered PHA synthase PhaC1437 Ps6–19, propionyl-CoA transferase Pct540Cp, acetyl-CoA acetyl-
transferase PhaA, and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase PhaB1 resulted in accumulation of 3.6% P(LA-3HB) and expression of engineered
enzymes PhaC1Pre and PctMe resulted in accumulation of 0.73% PDLA of the cell dry weight (CDW). According to NMR, P(LA-3HB)
contained D-lactic acid repeating sequences. For reference, expression of PhaA, PhaB1, and PHA synthase PhaC1 resulted in accu-
mulation 11% poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) of the CDW. Weight average molecular weights of these polymers were comparable to

Introduction
Global problems related to greenhouse gas emissions and solid
wastemanagementhaveincreasedinteresttoreplacepetroleum-
based plastics with the biobased and microbially produced poly-
hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymers. PHAs are biodegradable both
in marine (Dilkes-Hoffman et al., 2019) and soil environments
(Fernandes et al., 2020), which gives them unique advantage
over other plastic materials.Over 150 different hydroxyalkanoate
molecules are identified as possible PHA monomers (Koller, 2018;
Rehm,2003). Physical properties of PHA polymers can be up-
graded by designing controlled block and random copolymers
(McChalicher & Srienc, 2007; Pederson et al., 2006; Yamada et al.,
2009).ThesecarrynewfeaturesincomparisontonativePHApoly-
mers and enable the use of PHA materials in even wider range of
applications.
The use of 2-hydroxy acids and bioproduction of poly(d-lactic
acid) (PDLA) and copolymer P(LA-3HB) have so far been studied
mainlyinengineeredbacterialstrains(Choietal., 2016;Jungetal.,
2010;Taguchietal., 2008;Y angetal., 2010).Interesttowardsyeast
as production host for PHA production has however steadily in-
creased. PDLA production in yeast Yarrowia lipolytica was shown
withd-lacticacidfedfromtheculturemedia(Lajusetal., 2020).In
addition,production of poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and medium
chain length (mcl) PHAs from sugars has been demonstrated in
engineered yeasts including Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,Y. l i p o l y t i c a ,
and Pichia pastoris (Gaoetal., 2015;Kocharinetal., 2013;Leafetal.,
1996;Lietal., 2016;Poirieretal., 2002).Themetabolicengineering
oftheseeukaryoticcellsandoptimizationoftheircultivationcon-ditions have already resulted in up to 30-fold increase in PHB and
mcl-PHA production, reaching accumulation of 16–30% of poly-
mers of their cell dry weight (CDW) (Carlson & Srienc, 2006;d e
Las Heras et al., 2016; Portugal-Nunes et al., 2017; Rigouin et al.,
2019; Vijayasankaran et al., 2005). Yeasts are attractive hosts for
production of PHA polymers,because of their robustness and ca-
pability to use cheap raw materials as carbon sources. They also
tolerate high concentrations of sugars and organic acids. Yeast
bioprocessesarealsonotpronetophageinfectionspresentinbac-
terialfermentations.Thebiggercellsizeofyeastcouldpotentially
enable accumulation of larger PHA granules. Yeast also contain
membraneboundorganelles,andrecentlytargetingthePHAsyn-
thase to peroxisomes increased the PDLA accumulation by over
20-fold in Y. l i p o l y t i c a (Lajus et al., 2020).
In the biosynthesis of PDLA, copolymer P(LA-3HB), and other
2-hydroxyacid containing PHA polymers, two key enzymes are
needed.Propionyl-CoA transferases (Pct) convert 2-hydroxyacids,
including lactic acid, to 2-hydroxyacyl-CoAs, which are then fur-
ther polymerized by engineered PHA synthases (PhaC) (Fig. 1).
Native PHA synthases can polymerize efficiently only 3-, 4-, 5-,
and 6-hydroxyacyl-CoA monomers (Choi et al., 2019). Class II
PHA synthases from Pseudomonas species have been modified
to accept also 2-hydroxyacyl-CoAs (Taguchi et al., 2008;Y a n g
et al.,2010). Change in four amino acids at E130, S325, S477, and
Q481enables in vivopolymerizationofd-lactyl-CoA,glycolyl-CoA,
d-2-hydroxybutyryl-CoA,and even some aromatic hydroxyl acids
(Lajusetal., 2020;Y angetal., 2018).Theabilityoftheseengineered
PHA synthases to combine wide range of different monomers

Fig. 1.Metabolic pathways for production of poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) (Sandström et al., 2015),poly(d-lactic acid) (PDLA) ( Prabhu et al., 2012;Y a n g
et al.,2010,2011),and their copolymer P(LA-3HB).d-Lactic acid is produced from pyruvate with a stereospecific d-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) from L.
mesenteroides (Baek et al., 2016).
provides the possibility to produce polymers with different prop-
erties, potentially designed by modeling (Jiang et al., 2020). Since
all PHA synthases are strictly stereospecific their polymerization
is possible only for R-enantiomers. The production of intracellu-
lar d-lactic acid has been enhanced, for example, by expressing
a stereospecific d-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) and by deleting
endogenous d-lactate dehydrogenase (Choi et al., 2016). Several
Pct enzymes can convert d-lactic acid to d-lactyl-CoA, for exam-
ple wild type PctMe from Megasphaera elsdenii (Prabhu et al., 2012;
Taguchi et al., 2008),andengineeredPct540 Cpfrom Clostridium pro-
pionicum (Yang et al., 2010). Pct540 Cpgene has one active muta-
tion at V193A and three non-active mutations at T78C, T669C,
and A1125G. For production of PHB, two acetyl-CoA molecules
(CoA, Coenzyme A) are converted to acetoacetyl-CoA by acetyl-
transferase (PhaA). Acetoacetyl-CoA is then further converted to
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (3HB-CoA) by acetoacetyl-CoA reductase
(PhaB1). Finally 3HB-CoA monomers are combined to long PHB
chains by PHA synthase (PhaC1) (Fig. 1).
Although PHA production has been studied extensively in bac-
terial hosts during the past decades, production in yeast hosts
has caught less attention. The main polymer produced has been
PHB,andonlyonerecentpaperdescribestheuseof2-hydroxyacid
monomers in yeast Y. l i p o l y t i c a (Lajus et al., 2020). We wanted to
establish a robust S. cerevisiae platform that could potentially use
a wide range of monomers.We engineered S. cerevisiae strains for
productionofPDLA,PHB,andtheircopolymerP(LA-3HB)fromglu-
cose.We demonstrated polymerization of 3-hydroxybutyrate and
d-lacticacidforco-andhomopolymerswithwidesubstratespeci-
ficity PHA synthases PhaC1437 Ps6–19and PhaC1Pre in S. cerevisiae .These enzymes were used since they have shown efficient lac-
tic acid incorporation in P(LA-3HB) copolymer in recombinant E.
coli(Yang et al., 2011).Formed polymers were extracted and their
molecular properties were analyzed.This work paves the way for
design and production of new homo- and copolymers in yeast in
the future.

ing either leucine (strains H5519–H5524) or uracil (strains H5529
andH5531).Controlstrainswithoutplasmids(H5513,H5514)were
grown in SC medium. All cultivations were supplemented with
20 g l–1glucose as a carbon source and carried out in 250 ml Er-
lenmeyerflasksat30°Cwith220rpmshaking.Inoculaweregrown
in same liquid media and washed twice with sterile distilled wa-
terbeforestartingthecultivationsin50mloffreshgrowthmedia
for 72 hr.In the first round,three different biological replicates of
each strain were grown and analyzed for their PHA production.
Cultivation and analysis of the best producing replicate of each
strain was then repeated with three identical replicates, starting
from OD 6005a n df r o mO D 6000.2.Cell Growth, pH, and Extracellular Metabolites
The cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical den-
sity (OD 600) of the cultures at 600 nm with VitroSpec 2100 Pro
(AmershamBiosciences)andbymeasuringtheCDWfromfiltered
samples.BeforetheCDWanalysis,glassmicrofiberfilters(55mm,
GF/B Whatman) were dried over night at 100°C and weighted.For
analysis,samples of 2 ml were filtered,washed three times,dried
at 100°C overnight, and weighted. The CDW values of PHB pro-
ducing strains were calculated based on conversion of measured
OD600values to CDW,since these growth parameters showed lin-
ear correlation with R2value of 0.98 in the OD 600range 0.99–
21.35 (unpublished). The pH of the cultivation media was mea-
sured with Innolab pH 720 instrument (WTW) and Sentix Mic
electrode (WTW). Extracellular metabolites and media compo-
nents (glucose, ethanol, acetate, glycerol, and lactic acid) were
analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
(Toivari et al., 2010) using 5 mM sulfuric acid as eluent.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jimb/article/48/5-6/kuab028/6253250 by VTT Information Service user on 22 July 2021

Polymer Quantitation from Lyophilized Cells
with GC–MS
Gaschromatographymassspectrometry(GC–MS)wasusedtover-
ify polymer compositions and to quantify the amount of poly-
mer produced by each strain in relation to their CDW. Cells were
collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 6 min, washed three
times with water, and lyophilized overnight. Ten milligrams of
eachsampleweresubjectedtomethanolysisfor140minat100°C
waterbathinasolutioncontaining1mlchloroform,20 μlinternal
standard (3-hydroxybutyric acid), 150 μl sulfuric acid, and 830 μl
methanol. Samples were cooled to room temperature and water-
soluble particles were removed by addition of 0.5 ml of distilled
water. Chloroform phase was analyzed by using gas chromatog-
raphy system (7890, Agilent) and HP-FFAP column (19091F-102,
Agilent). PLA, l-lactic acid, and 3-hydroxybutyric acid were used
as standards.
Polymer Extraction
Polymers were extracted from 600 to 2000 mg of lyophilized cells
withchloroform.Lyophilizedcellpelletsweregrindedwithmetal-
lic spoon, divided into 140–300 mg aliquots, supplemented with
5 ml of chloroform in 12 ml glass screw cap tubes, and boiled in
95°C water bath for 3 hr. The solutions were stirred over night at
roomtemperature,filteredwith0.45 μmPTFEfilters,andconcen-
trated to 300 μl. Twenty-fold volume of ice-cold methanol was
added to all samples and tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm
for 20 min. Supernatants were removed. In addition to methanol
washing, PDLA and P(LA-3HB) samples for size exclusion chro-
matography (SEC) analysis were washed also with diethyl ether.
PDLA and P(LA-3HB) were dissolved in 100 μl chloroform and 20-
fold ice-cold diethyl ether was added to the samples, followed by
centrifugationat3000rpmfor20minandremovalofsupernatant.
Remaining precipitated polymers were dried and weighed.
Analysis of the Purified Polymers
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was used to verify
the monomer compositions and polymer structures. PDLA, PHB,
and P(LA-3HB) polymers were dissolved to final concentration of
830 mg l–1in 600 μl chloroform containing 0.03% (v/v) tetram-
ethylsilane standard. Each polymer was analyzed in three repli-

etition rate for the 1D1H was 4.6 s. The zero quantum filtered

HSQC experiments, a matrix of 2048 ×256 data points was col-
lected, zero-filled once in F1 and a π/2 shifted squared sine-bell
weighting function was applied in both dimensions prior to the
Fourier transformation. The absolute value heteronuclear multi-
ple bond correlation (HMBC) spectra were recorded without de-
coupling using Bruker’s pulse program hmbcgpndqf .The one-bond
13C–1H coupling constant was set to 150 Hz and the long-range
13C–1H coupling constant was set to 8 Hz (1/2 J=3.3333 ms). Amatrix of 4096 ×256 points was collected, zero-filled with lin-
ear prediction to 4096 ×1024 points and an unshifted sine-bell

The molecular weight measurements were performed with
SEC. Three replicates of the PHB sample and a commercial PHB
standard (363502, Sigma) were dissolved in 1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-
2-propanol (HFIP) for 3 days. The PDLA and P(LA-3HB) samples,
grown from starting OD 600of 0.2, and a commercial PHB stan-
dard (363502, Sigma) were dissolved in chloroform and mixed in
room temperature for 7 days. At the fourth day, chloroform sam-
ples were heated to 80°C for 30 min to ensure complete dissolu-
tion.All samples were filtrated with 0.45 μm syringe filters before
the analysis. The HFIP eluent with 5 mM sodium trifluoroacetate
was delivered at a rate of 0.5 ml min−1at 40°C and chloroform
eluent at a rate of 0.6 ml min−1at 30°C. The HFIP system was
equipped with Waters styragel HR-4E column and HR 5 column
and the chloroform system with styragel HR 4 and 3 columns.
All systems contained a pre-column and a refractive index de-
tector (2414, Waters). The molecular weights were calculated ei-
theragainst10polystyrenestandardsof1260–3,040,000gmol−1in
chloroform or against nine poly(methyl methacrylate) standards
of 2710–1,667,000 g mol−1(Agilent) in HFIP, using 3rd order fit
(R2=0.998–0.999) and Waters Empower 3 software.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was used to
determine the polymer melting temperatures. Differential scan-
ning calorimeter (DSC2,Mettler Toledo) was equipped with intra-
cooler (TC100MT, Huber) and run under nitrogen atmosphere.
Samples of 3–6 mg were weighed into 40 μla l u m i n u mc r u c i b l e s ,
lids were pricked, and crucibles were closed with cold-pressing.
Samples were heated twice with heating rate 10°C min–1.I nt h e

75°C.Inthesecondscan,sampleswerecooleddownto −60°Cand
heatedto250°C.ResultswereobtainedwithMettlerToledoSTARe
software (version 13.0). The data were collected from the second
heating scan.PHB samples were analyzed in two replicates.
GC–MS analysis of the purified polymers was performed to
complement the corresponding NMR results and GC–MS results
from the lyophilized cells. Samples of 0.5 mg were subjected to
methanolysis and analyzed in the same way as lyophilized cells.
Each polymer was analyzed in three replicates.
Results
PDLA, P(LA-3HB), and PHB Producing
S. cerevisiae Strains
S. cerevisiae strains containing PDLA,P(LA-3HB),or PHB pathways,
presented in Fig. 1, were constructed. To demonstrate the poly-
mer production, three transformants from each strain (H5519–
H5524, H5529) were grown on media with 20 g l–1glucose as a
carbon source, starting from OD 6002. Cells were collected after
72 hr, washed, lyophilized, and the polymer content was ana-
lyzed with GC–MS method. All strains expressing ldhA, Pct, and
PhaC (H5519–H5522) enzymes produced PDLA.The control strain
(H5513) lacking the PHA synthase did not show any lactic acid in
the GC–MS analysis, even though extracellular d-lactic acid con-
centration at 72 hr was 7.44 ±0.86 g l–1. This indicates that ei-
ther the intracellular concentration of free d-lactic acid was very
low or that free d-lactic acids was efficiently removed from the
cells during the washing prior to GC–MS analysis. Result demon-
strates that free lactic acid was not distorting the polymer ac-
cumulation results in GC–MS analysis. Polymer content of PDLADownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jimb/article/48/5-6/kuab028/6253250 by VTT Information Service user on 22 July 2021

Characterization of PDLA, P(LA-3HB), and PHB
Produced in S. cerevisiae
The transformants of best polymer producing strains (H5520,
H5523, and H5529), and their corresponding control strains, were
grown in three parallel cultivations starting from OD 6005( F i g .2).
Inaddition,thePDLAandP(LA-3HB)producingstrainsweregrown
in three parallel cultivations from starting OD 6000.2 to repeat the
experiment and to produce PDLA and P(LA-3HB) for SEC analysis
(Fig.3). Cell growth, extracellular metabolite production, carbon
source consumption, and pH were measured every 24 hr. When
cultivation started from OD 6005, glucose was entirely consumed
in all cultivations during the first 24 hr. When cultivation started
from OD 6000.2,small residual glucose concentrations of 0.06 and
0.36 g l–1were measured from the media at 24 hr with PDLA
and P(LA-3HB) strains, respectively. All control strains grew bet-
ter than the polymer producing strains. Cultures did not grow orgrew onlyvery littleafter 24 hr whenglucosewas depleted.Culti-

Analysis of Polymer Properties
Polymers were extracted from cells and analyzed with GC–MS,
SEC,and NMR in order to verify their monomer compositions and
structures. The NMR spectra are shown in Figs 5and6,a n dt h e

hydrolysis of commercial PLA (Ingeo 3251D, NatureWorks) con-
taining dimer,trimer,tetramer,and pentamer units (Anghelescu-Hakala & Nyyssölä, 2020) was used for end group analysis. The
samplewasanalyzedby1HNMRtoidentifythelocationoftheCH
groups linked to the end hydroxyl group in the NMR spectra.The
CH signals of the hydroxyl terminal were detected at 4.45 ppm in
the oligomeric standard sample. Corresponding 4.45 ppm peaks
from the PDLA produced by S. cerevisiae strains were just above
the detection limit and much smaller than in the commercial
PLA sample,indicating that the degree of polymerization of yeast
PDLA sample was higher than that of the commercial PLA. Due
to the low intensity of the end group signal from our sample,
the accurate quantification was not possible. In addition, in the
oligomeric PLA sample, scattering of the spectra was seen in 5.2
and 1.6 ppm signals due to proximity of polymer ends. Similar
scattering was not observed in PDLA produced in yeast nor in

the methyl signals were overlapped with the strong background

(Choi et al., 2016; Jae et al., 2013; Solaiman, 2003;Y a n ge ta l . ,

S. cerevisiae enables future tailoring of polymer properties in
yeast.
Thed-lacticacidfractioninthecopolymerP(LA-3HB)produced
in this study varied from 46 to 65 mol %. Similar, approximately
50% lactic acid fraction was reported also when PhaC1437 Ps6–19
was expressed in recombinant E. coli(Yang et al., 2011).P(LA-3HB)
copolymers with these d-lactic acid fractions have been reported
to have lower melting temperatures and higher elasticities than
t h o s eo fP D L Aa n dP H B( T a g u c h ie ta l . , 2008; Yamada et al., 2009,

and 3HB monomers are covalently attached forming copolymers
withrandomstructure.Majorityofd-LAmonomers,79%,werelo-
cated between two other d-LA monomers,16% between d-LA and
3HB monomers, and only 5% between two 3HB monomers. The
result indicates that P(LA-3HB) copolymer produced in this study
contained d-LA repeating sequences. Repeating d-LA sequencesin P(LA-3HB) copolymers have also been found in some bacte-
rial studies (Ochi et al., 2013;T a j i m ae ta l . , 2012; Yamada et al.,
2009). The repeating monomer sequences are interesting since
they might enable crystallization of otherwise amorphous poly-
mer and thus influence its thermal properties (Peacock & Cal-
houn,2006). According to SEC analysis, the P(LA-3HB) polymer
had molecular weights,Mn and Mw,of at least 19.2 and 24.6 kDa,
respectively. These molecular weights are slightly smaller than
molecular weights,Mn 22 kDa and Mw 39 kDa,reported for P(LA-
3HB) with similar lactate fraction and produced by E. coliexpress-
ing the same PHA synthase PhaC1437 Ps6–19(Yang et al., 2010).

shorter polymers could be suitable for applications like aqueous
dispersion coatings for packaging materials.
PDLAandP(LA-3HB)contentsinthisstudy,0.73%and3.6%,are
similar to the lower range reported in bacterial hosts, the whole
range varying from 0.5% to 75% (Jung et al., 2010;K a d o y ae ta l . ,
2015;Y a n ge ta l . , 2011). Yeast strains produced approximately
9gl–1extracellular d-LA indicating that the d-LA production rate
exceeded the capability of cells to polymerize it. In addition, the
PDLA and P(LA-3HB) producing strains grew remarkably slower
compared to their control strains without the Pct and PhaC en-
zymes. Possibly the use of acetyl-CoA for generation of d-lactyl-
CoA affected their growth. Wild type Pct from C. propionicum has
been reported to inhibit cell growth in E. coli(Selmer et al., 2003).
Further optimization of ldhA, Pct, and PHA synthase expression
levels and activities could thus improve cell growth, increase the
polymer yield, and prevent excessive extracellular d-lactic acid
accumulation. For example, in the recombinant Corynebacterium
glutamicum PDLA yield has been increased fourfold by enhancing
thePhaC1PsSTQKPHAsynthaseactivity(Matsumotoetal., 2014).
The PLA content of the CDW in this study was 10-fold lower
compared to that of PHB. This may be due to non-optimal avail-
ability of d-lactyl-CoA as a precursor, lower activity of the engi-
neered synthase enzymes towards d-lactyl-CoA, compared to 3-
hydroxy butyryl-CoA, or physical properties of the formed poly-
mer,as discussedbelow.Similar decrease hasbeen observed with
engineered E. colistrains where the highest reported PHB yields
(Aramvashetal., 2015;Zhangetal., 2018)havebeen10-foldhigher
thanthehighestobtainedPDLAyields(Jungetal., 2010;Y angetal.,
2011).Ithasbeenhypothesizedthatd-lactyl-CoAcouldoccasion-

Recent in vitrostudy, with PhaC1PsSTQK PHA synthase (carrying
two amino acid changes, S325 and Q481), reports termination of
PDLA polymerization when PDLA chains reach molecular weight
of 3 kDa (Matsumoto et al., 2018). The reason for this relatively
short molecular weight was suggested to be the high glass tran-
sition temperature of PDLA homopolymers (60°C) that would de-
crease polymer mobility notably at common reaction tempera-
tures of 30–37°C. However, in vivostudies using PHA synthases
with three or four active mutations in their active sites report
production of 4- to 18-fold longer polymers. Following molecular
weights of PDLA are reported in E. coli:2 3k D a( M n )a n d5 5k D a
(Mw)withPhaC1PrecarryingaminoacidchangesE130,S325,S477,
and Q481 (Yang et al., 2011) and 30 kDa (Mw) with PhaC1310 Ps6–19
carryingaminoacidchangesE130D,S477F,andQ481K(Jungetal.,
2010). In addition, molecular weights of 12.5 (Mn) and 50.5 (Mw)
are reported in yeast Y. l i p o l y t i c a expressing PHA synthase from
Pseudomonas aeruginosa with amino acid changes E130D, S325T,
S477R, and Q481M (Lajus et al., 2020). In the present study,
SEC analysis confirmed that for PDLA produced in S. cerevisiae
molecular weights, Mw and Mn, are at least 6.3 and 5.3 kDa,
respectively.
The PHB yield of 11% of CDW in this study is comparable to
otherstudiesofPHBproductionin S. cerevisiae (Breueretal., 2002;
Carlson & Srienc, 2006). However, optimization of pathway en-
zymes, carbon sources, aeration, and redox balances in the cell
can increase the polymer yield in S. cerevisiae up to 16.4 % (de
Las Heras et al., 2016;K o c h a r i ne ta l . , 2012; Portugal-Nunes et al.,
2017).ThehighestreportedPHApercentagesperCDWinyeastare
30% of PHB for P. pastoris (Vijayasankaran et al., 2005) and 30% of
mcl PHAs for Y. l i p o l y t i c a (Rigouin et al., 2019). These values were
measured as averages of the cell population. However, Carlson &
Scrienc ( 2006) discuss,based on fluorescence microscopy images,
that some S. cerevisiae cells could have accumulated up to 50%PHB of CDW while others seemed empty. Population heterogene-
itywasseenalsoinfluorescencebasedflowcytometryanalysisof
PHB producing S. cerevisiae (Kacmar et al., 2006). These observa-
tions suggest that PHA production in yeast can still be increased
both at individual cell level and by reducing the population het-
erogeneity.
The suitability of S. cerevisiae for PHA production is also sup-
ported by SEC results of the extracted PHB in this study.The aver-
age molecular weights, 336 kDa (Mn) and 1130 kDa (Mw), of PHB
in this study are higher than average molecular weights,130 kDa
(Mn) and 200 kDa (Mw),of PHB produced from acetate by Y. l i p o l y -
ticaexpressing the same PHA synthase from C. necator (Li et al.,
2016).Infact,molecularweightsinthisstudyaresimilartothere-
ported molecular weights of PHB produced with the native bacte-
rialproducer C. necator ,400kDa(Mn)and1136kDa(Mw)(Meixner
et al.,2018), and 1400 kDa (Mw) (Fei et al., 2016). The melting
temperature of the PHB produced by S. cerevisiae , 176.0°C, is also
in accordance with results from literature for bacterial PHB (Lee,
1996).Theseresultsindicatethatrecombinant S. cerevisiae strains
canproducepolymerswithpropertiescomparabletothoseofthe
polymers produced by the engineered or native PHA producing
bacteria.
The S. cerevisiae platform can be further developed for pro-
duction of PHA polymers in non-buffered or low pH conditions
(Fernandes et al., 2005; Mitsui et al., 2020; Rajkumar et al., 2016;
Zhong et al. 2021), and for utilization of various industrial side
streams as raw materials. In addition, the use of wide substrate
specificity of the studied PHA synthases enables tailoring of the
polymer properties in future.
