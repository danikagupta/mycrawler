The trace element selenium (Se) which acts as a component of major metabolic 
pathways is essential for animals and humans health. However there are 
abundant Se deficiencies worldwide and millions of people may be affected by 
the accompanying endemic diseases ( Fairweather -Tait et al., 2011). 
Methylation and subsequent volatilization is an important Se cycle process in 
natural environments which may lessen available Se in soils, ultimately limiting 
its entry into the food chain (Winkel et al., 2012). Se methylation is mostly 
regarded as a detoxification process for organisms since volatilization 
decreases the intracellular Se content. Previous studies of Se volatilization were 
performed using Se concentrations 103 - 106 fold high er (sub -ppm / ppm) than 
those commonly found in the environment (Luxem et al., 2017; Vriens et al., 
2016). Se volatilization fluxes based on those experiments using high 
concentrations may have limited relevance for most environments which only 
contain tra ce amounts of Se.  
Here, we developed a method to study Se methylation using a Pseudomonas  
strain with treatment of different concentrations of SeIV in sub -ppb to ppb 
range. The substrate 74Se-selenite were synthesized from elemental 74Se 
through a nitric acid oxidation reaction. Headspace SPME -GC-MS was used to 
quantify methylated 74Se compounds while 80Se methylated from the 
background Se in the culture medium was measured. Using Se stable isotope 
allowed distinguishing external from e ndogenous Se methylation and for the 
first time studying microbial selenium methylation at environmental relevant 
concentrations.
