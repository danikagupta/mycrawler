This paper describes a kinetic model for the decomposition
of hydrogen peroxide by ferric ion in homogeneousaqueous solution (pH <3). The reaction was investigated
experimentally at 25.0 °C and
I)0.1 M (HClO 4/NaClO 4),
in a completely mixed batch reactor and under a wide range
of experimental conditions (1 epHe3; 0.2 mM e
[H2O2]0e1M ;5 0 μMe[Fe(III)] 0e1 mM; 1 e[H2O2]0/
[Fe(III)] 0e5000). The results of this study demonstrated that
the rate of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by Fe-
(III) could be predicted very accurately by a kinetic model
which takes into account the rapid formation and theslower decomposition of Fe(III) -hydroperoxy complexes (Fe
III-
(HO 2)2+and FeIII(OH)(HO 2)+). The rate constant for the
unimolecular decomposition of the Fe(III) -hydroperoxy
complexes was determined to be 2.7 ×10-3s-1. The use
of the kinetic model allows a better understanding of
the effects of operational parameters (i.e., pH and [H 2O2]0/
[Fe(III)] 0) on the complex kinetics of decomposition of
H2O2by Fe(III).
Introduction
The mechanism and kinetics of decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide (H 2O2) by Fe(II) and Fe(III) species have been the
subject of numerous investigations over the last century ( 1-
5). These reactions are of interest in biochemistry ( 6, 7) and
in the chemistry of atmospheric water droplets ( 8, 9) and of
natural waters ( 10). In water treatment, the use of advanced
oxidation processes (AOPs), which involve the in-situ gen-
eration of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH), has emerged
during the last two decades. The dark reaction of H 2O2with
ferrous salts (known as Fenton’s reagent) and the photo-assisted decomposition of H
2O2(Photo-Fenton) are possible
sources of hydroxyl radicals for the destruction of organicpollutants ( 11-15).
For the Fe(III)/H
2O2system, H 2O2is catalytically decom-
posed by Fe(III) at acidic pH. The reaction pathway acceptedby most of the authors proceeds through the formation ofhydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals (Table 1) ( 16, 17 ). For
simplification, coordinated water molecules in the coordinate
sphere are not presented in the chemical formulas.
Spectrophotometric studies have shown that the reaction
of H
2O2with Fe3+primarily leads to the formation of an Fe-
(III)-hydroperoxy complex formulated as FeIII(HO 2)2+(18).
At very high concentrations of H 2O2, the formation of diperoxocomplexes has also been suggested ( 19-21). In a recent study
carried out with ferric perchlorate in solution in perchloricacid between pH 1.0 and 3.0, our spectral data gave evidence
for the formation of two Fe(III) -hydroperoxy complexes ( 22),
formulated in their simplest forms as Fe
III(HO 2)2+(I1) and
FeIII(OH)(HO 2)+(I2):
The formation of these complexes is very fast and equilibria
are attained within a few seconds after mixing of Fe(III) andH
2O2solutions. The equilibrium constants KI 1and KI 2,
determined at 25.0 ( (0.2)°C and I)0.1 M (HClO 4/NaClO 4
solution) were estimated as 3.1 ×10-3and 2 ×10-4,
respectively ( 22).
Once formed, the Fe(III) -hydroperoxy complexes are
assumed to decompose in a unimolecular way to yield Fe2+
and HO 2•(16, 17 ):
The rates of decomposition of Fe(III) -peroxy complexes are
not well-known. It has been estimated as 1.1 ×10-2s-1at
30°C(23) by using KI 1)3.65×10-3(18).
The rate of decomposition of H 2O2by Fe(III) has been
studied extensively, and many kinetic models derived fromhypothetical mechanisms have been tested ( 16, 17, 24 ).
Nevertheless, no model describes well the overall rate ofdecomposition of H
2O2over a wide range of experimental
conditions (pH, Fe(III), and H 2O2concentrations). Reasons
for this might be the complexity of the decompositionpathway of H
2O2by Fe(III) and of the considerable uncer-
tainties on the various equilibrium and kinetic constants ofindividual reactions. Furthermore, the formation of Fe(III) -
hydroperoxy complexes as intermediates has never beenconsidered in the kinetic models.
The objective of the present work is therefore to formulate
an appropriate reaction model for the homogeneous catalyticdecomposition of H
2O2by Fe(III) which takes into account
the formation of Fe(III) -hydroperoxy complexes and to test
its applicability for interpreting the overall rate of decom-position of H
2O2under various experimental conditions.
This study has been carried out with ferric perchlorate in
perchloric acid/sodium perchlorate solution and in theabsence of organic solutes. A future paper will describe akinetic modeling for the oxidation of organic compounds by
Fe(III)/H
2O2.

Published on Web 07/02/1999(1) The hydrolysis of Fe(III) (reactions II.1 -II.3 in Table
2): Equilibrium constants for Fe(III) hydrolysis used in thisstudy were calculated for 0.1 M ionic strength from literaturevalues ( 25, 26 ).
(2) The initiation step: The initiation step of the mech-
anism of decomposition of H
2O2by Fe(III) includes the
formation of the Fe(III) -hydroperoxy complexes (reactions
II.4 and II.5) and their unimolecular decomposition whichyields Fe
2+and HO 2•/O2•-(reactions II.6a and II.6b). The
equilibrium constants (KI 1,K I 2) for the formation of FeIII-
(HO 2)2+(I1) and FeIII(OH)(HO 2)+(I2) have been determined
in a previous work ( 22) conducted at 25 °C and I)0.1 M.
(3) The propagation and termination steps represented
by reactions II.7 -II.12b: For the reaction between Fe(II) and
H2O2(reaction II.7, Table 2), a previous study ( 27) carried
out with ferrous perchlorate in HClO 4/NaClO 4solutions (25
°C;I)0.1 M) has shown that the decomposition of H 2O2by
Fe(II) ([Fe(II)] 0/[H 2O2]0>2) proceeds through the formation
of two intermediates which might be an Fe(III) -hydroperoxy
complex and the ferryl ion ( 28-30). At pH <3.5 and in the
presence of very low concentrations of organic compounds(<2μM), our kinetic results gave evidence that overall reaction
II.7 in Table 2 (with k
7)63 M-1s-1) could be used to describe
the rate of the initiation step of the decomposition mech-anism of H
2O2by Fe(II) and the rate of production of OH
radical.
(4) Recombination of radicals (reactions II.13a -II.15)
which may represent minor pathways have also beenconsidered.
For calculations, the following assumptions and simpli-
fications have been made:
(1) Complexation reactions of Fe(III) and acid -base
equilibrium were considered to be very fast equilibriumprocesses.
(2) The rate constants for the unimolecular decomposition
of I
1and I 2, which are unknown, are assumed to be identical
and equal to k6. It should be noted that under our experi-
mental conditions (pH <3.5), I 1is the predominant Fe(III) -
hydroperoxy complex.
(3) The Fe(III) -hydroperoxy complexes I 1and I 2do not
participate in propagation and termination reactions. There-fore, it has been assumed that only uncomplexed Fe(III)participates in these reactions (reactions II.11a and II.11b).According to the reaction scheme presented in Table 2,
the concentration -time profiles for H
2O2,F e2+, Fe(III), and
for radical species can be described by the following set ofdifferential equations:
where [Fe(III)]
Tand [Fe(III)] are the total concentration of
Fe(III) and the concentration of uncomplexed Fe(III), re-spectively:
The system of nonlinear ordinary equations (eqs 5 -10)
was solved numerically on compatible PC (Turbo Pascal byBorland) by using the fourth-order Runge -Kutta method.TABLE 2. Proposed Reaction Mechanism for Fe(III)-Catalyzed Decomposition of H 2O2(25°C;I)0.1 M)

VOL. 33, NO. 16, 1999 / ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY 92727Steady-state conditions were assumed for the rate of radical
species. The reaction parameters (pH, [H 2O2]0, [Fe(III)] 0) were
specified as inputs to the program. Reaction rates andequilibrium constants, presented in Table 2, were also usedas inputs to the program. The concentration -time profiles
for H
2O2,F e2+,H O 2•/O2•-, and•OH were calculated by the
program, and the concentration of H 2O2predicted by the
model was compared to the experimental measurements.
Experimental Section
All reagents used were reagent grade and were used withoutfurther purification. Ferric perchlorate (Fe(ClO
4)3‚9H 2O, 98%)
was purchased from Aldrich and hydrogen peroxide (30%,unstabilized) from Fluka. Stock solutions of H
2O2and ferric
salts were prepared in ultrapure water (MilliQ water; TOC e
0.2 mg L-1;1 8Ωcm).
Great care was taken to make ferric solutions to prevent
precipitation of ferric hydroxide: an appropriate weight ofFe(ClO
4)3‚9H 2O was diluted in some milliliters of perchloric
acid (0.1 N) and then added to an appropriate volume ofultrapure water to give the desired pH and concentration ofFe(III). The ionic strength was adjusted to 0.1 M with sodiumperchlorate (corresponding activity coefficient of H
+equal
to 0.85). Solutions of ferric salts were prepared daily, andkinetic experiments were rapidly carried out to prevent theeffect of the maturation of monomeric Fe(III) species topolymeric Fe(III) species.
All experiments were conducted in a thermostated batch
reactor (25.0 (0.2°C) and in the absence of light. Kinetic
experiments of the decomposition of H
2O2were initiated by
adding H 2O2under vigorous magnetic-stirring to the solution
containing ferric salt. At various intervals, samples of solutionin the batch reactor were withdrawn during kinetic experi-ments and analyzed for H
2O2content.
Absorption spectra of the solutions were measured with
a Safas DES 190 double beam spectrophotometer, and pHmeasurements were made with a Radiometer pH-meter(Model PHM 250) calibrated at 25 °C with acidic standard
buffers between pH 1.0 and 3.0.
Analysis of Fe(II) was carried out by using o-phenan-
throline colorimetric method ( 38) and using a value of /epsilon1)
11 300 M
-1cm-1for the Fe(II) -phenanthroline complex at
510 nm. Dissolved Fe(III) concentrations were also measuredby the o-phenanthroline method after filtration of the solution
through a Millipore Millex-25 (0.45 μM) filter and reduction
of Fe(III) into Fe(II) with hydroxylamine hydrochlorate.
Hydrogen peroxide was determined iodometrically ([H
2O2]
>10-3M) or spectrophotometrically using TiCl 4method ( 39)
([H 2O2]e10-3M;/epsilon1)730 M-1cm-1). No interferences have
been noticed with the concentrations of ferric ions used.
Results
For all the experiments performed in the present work, theinitial rate of decomposition of H
2O2could be described by
a pseudo-first-order kinetic law with respect to H 2O2con-
centration
where kobsis the pseudo-first-order rate constant of the initial
rate of decomposition of H 2O2.kobswas calculated from
experimental data, covering 0 -20% removal of H 2O2. The
measured values for kobsare reported in Tables 3 and 4. In
experiments carried out in duplicate, kobsvaried by less than
3%.
Furthermore, pH was nearly constant during the course
of the reaction (pH variation: <0.02 pH unit for experiments
conducted at pH e2, ande0.05 pH unit at pH )3), and
Fe(II) analyses by the o-phenanthroline method revealed that
Fe(II) concentration was always less than 1 μM.Effect of pH on kobs.Kinetic data obtained from experi-
ments conducted at pH varying from 1.0 to 5.0 and with[H
2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0)50 (Table 3, Figure 1) show that kobs
increases with pH in the range 1 -3.2. Above pH 3.2, kobs
decreased with increasing pH. This decrease can be attributed
to the precipitation of Fe(III), as confirmed by the measuredvalues obtained for dissolved Fe(III) concentrations (Table3).

pH (pH 3.0, Table 4), kobsvaried with the initial concentrations
of reactants. For a constant initial concentration of Fe(III)([Fe(III)]

[Fe(III)] 0, Figure 2a) and increased linearly with [Fe(III)] 0
(Figure 2b). Under these conditions, a second-order kineticlaw described the initial rate of decomposition of H
2O2
where kdis the second-order rate constant for the overall
rate of decomposition of H 2O2by Fe(III). kdwas found to be
equal to 0.47 ( (0.03) M-1s-1at pH 3.0 ( I)0.1 M; 25 °C).
For [H 2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0>500, kobsdecreased with increasing
[H2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0. As will be discussed below, this decrease
ofkobswas attributed to a decrease of the molar fraction of
uncomplexed Fe(III) with increasing H 2O2concentration.
During the course of the reaction, the rate of decomposi-
tion of H 2O2deviates from the first-order kinetic law. The
logarithm of [H 2O2]/[H 2O2]0plotted versus time did not follow
a straight line but showed distinct curvature (Figure 3).
Kinetic Modeling. To test the reaction model proposed
in Table 2, the kinetic model was run by varying the value
ofk6until a good fit between experimental data and model
calculation was achieved. The best fit was obtained with k6
)2.7×10-3s-1for all the experiments performed at pH <
3.2. As shown in Figure 3, an excellent agreement between
measured and simulated H 2O2concentration profiles versus
reaction time was obtained.
In addition, the pseudo-first-order rate constants ( kobs)
calculated from the initial slopes of simulated plots of ln-([H
2O2]/[H 2O2]0) versus time were consistent with the mea-
sured kobsvalues for all the experiments conducted at pH <
3.2 (Figure 1). Above pH 3.2, the kinetic model cannot beapplied since precipitation reactions of Fe(III) and theircomplex kinetic rates have not been incorporated in the
model. It should also be noted that the pseudo-first-orderrate constants determined by Pignatello ( 40) at various pH
could also be calculated by our kinetic model after correcting
the equilibrium constants for the experimental conditions
used by the author (Figure 4).
Furthermore, the decay of absorbance in the region 300 -
550 nm with reaction time could also successfully bepredicted by our kinetic model by using the molar absorp-tivities of Fe(III) -hydroxy complexes and Fe(III) -hydro-
peroxy complexes reported in a previous paper ( 22) (Figure
5).

hydroperoxy complexes I 1and I 2(reactions II.6a and II.6b in
Table 2). It has been assumed that propagation and termi-nation reactions only involve Fe(II) and uncomplexed Fe-(III).
Assuming that (i) [Fe

tration of the dimer in eq 12 can be neglected, the fractionof Fe(III) present in the form of uncomplexed Fe(III) ( R
Fe(III))
and of complexed Fe(III) ( RI1+R I2) can be expressed as
Equations 15 and 16 indicate that RFe(III),RI1, and RI2depend
only on pH and on the concentration of H 2O2. In Figure 6,
RFe(III) is plotted as a function of [H 2O2] for pH 1, 2, and 3.
Figure 6 illustrates that the fraction of Fe(III) present in theform of Fe(III) -peroxy complexes is very small at pH 1 ( R
Fe(III)
>0.99) and becomes significant at concentrations of H 2O2
higher than 0.1 M at pH 3.0.
Apparent Second-Order Rate Constant for the Initiation
Step. Assuming that I 1and I 2are in a very fast equilibrium
with Fe(III) and H 2O2, the rate of the initiation step of the
mechanism of decomposition of H 2O2by Fe(III) can be
written asBy considering the equilibrium constants KI 1and KI 2,e q1 7
becomes
By introducing RFe(III) into eq 18, the following expression for
the rate of the initiation step can be derived
where kiis the apparent second-order rate constant for the
initiation step of the mechanism of decomposition of H 2O2
by Fe(III):
Since RFe(III)depends on the concentration of Fe(III), H 2O2,
and of pH, kiis not constant. Using the equilibrium constants
listed in Table 2, kihas been plotted as a function of pH in
Figure 7 for three concentrations of H 2O2(0.001, 0.1, and 1
M) and for [Fe(III)] 0)200μM. As Figure 7 illustrates, ki
increases with pH (pH 1.0: ki)6.9×10-5M-1s-1; pH 2.0:
ki)5.6×10-4M-1s-1;p H3 : ki)1.9×10-3M-1s-1, values
calculated for [H 2O2]<0.1 M). Concentration of H 2O2has a
significant effect on the value of kiat pH >2.0 (at pH )3.0:
ki)1.9×10-3M-1s-1for [H 2O2])0.1 M; 1.2 ×10-3M-1

Effect of [H 2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0onkobsat pH 3.0. At pH 3.0,
experimental and simulated data have shown that thepseudo-first-order kinetic constant for the initial rate ofdecomposition of H
2O2depends on the ratio of concentra-
tions of H 2O2to Fe(III) (Figure 2) and that the overall
decomposition rate of H 2O2deviates from a first-order kinetic
law during the course of the reaction. As pointed out by Barbet al. (16 ) and Walling and Weil ( 17), the steady-state
concentration of Fe(II) plays a key role in the rate ofdecomposition of H
2O2.
To illustrate the effect of [H 2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0on the con-
centration of Fe(II), the kinetic model was used to calculateconcentration -time profiles for Fe(II) for the experiments
conducted at pH 3.0 and with [Fe(III)]
o)200μM. Figure 8
shows that Fe(II) concentration versus reaction time reachesa maximum value and that its maximum concentrationdepends on [H
2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0.
For [H 2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0values lower than 50, an increase of
the initial concentration of H 2O2enhances the initial rate of
formation of Fe(II) and leads to an increase of the concen-tration of Fe(II) in the solution. Once formed, Fe(II) may be

decomposition of H 2O2. By considering these two reactions,
increasing H 2O2concentration will accelerate the rate of
decomposition of H 2O2. This is consistent with the experi-
mental data.
For 50 <[H2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0<500, most of the OH radicals
are scavenged by H 2O2(k9[H2O2].k8[Fe(II)]). Consequently,
reaction II.8 in Table 2 can be ignored. By assuming thatreactions II.13a -II.15 in Table 2 are also of little importance,
the following simplified expression for the overall decom-position rate of H
2O2can be derived:
The steady-state concentration of Fe2+is defined by
where kiis given by eq 20. k10app and k11app are the apparent
second-order rate constants of HO 2•/O2•-with Fe(II) (reac-
tions II.10a and II.10b in Table 2) and Fe(III) (reactions II.11aand II.11b in Table 2), respectively (at pH 3: k
10app )1.3×
106M-1s-1and k11app )6.6×105M-1s-1).
Expressions 17 and 18 are similar to those formulated by
Barb et al. ( 16), except that the formation and the decom-
position of Fe(III) -hydroperoxy complexes have been taken
into account in our reaction scheme and incorporated in theexpression for k
i(eq 20). Since RFe(III)andkiare nearly constant
for [H 2O2] values less than 0.1 M at pH 3 (Figure 7), eq 22
indicates that [Fe2+]ssis not a function of the concentration
of H 2O2and is linearly dependent upon [Fe(III)] 0. Therefore,
kobswill be constant and the overall decomposition of H 2O2
will be second-order:
with [Fe(III)] ≈[Fe(III)] 0and
Under conditions stated above (50 <[H2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0<500,
pH 3.0), computed concentration -time profiles for Fe2+
confirm that Fe2+concentration rapidly reaches a “plateau”
which is independent of [H 2O2] and proportional to [Fe-
(III)] 0. Furthermore with Fe(II) concentration at its maximum,
kobsorkdvalues calculated from the kinetic model were
consistent with those given by eqs 21 and 24, respectively.The difference between computed and calculated values wasless than 10% and can be attributed to the uncertainties on
the measured values of pH and k
obs.
For [H 2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0values above 500 at pH 3, the
decrease of kobswith increasing [H 2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0(Figure 2a)
can be explained by the fact that the fraction of Fe(III) presentin the form of Fe(III) -hydroperoxy complexes becomes
significant at pH 3.0. Under these experimental conditions,R
Fe(III) decreases when [H 2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0increases (Figure 6),
and as expected from eqs 20 and 24, the overall decomposi-tion rate of H
2O2will decrease.
It should be noted that at pH <3, the effect of [H 2O2]0/
[Fe(III)] 0onRFe(III) should be less important. As is shown in
Figure 6, RFe(III) is close to 1.0 for [H 2O2]<0 . 1Ma tp H1a n d
2; model prediction as well as experimental data did notshow a decrease of k

Deviation from the Pseudo-First-Order Kinetics. During
the course of the reaction, the ratio of concentration of H 2O2
to Fe(III) ([H 2O2]/[Fe(III)], [Fe(III)] ≈[Fe(III)] 0) decreases.
Since kobsis a function of [H 2O2]0/[Fe(III)] 0(Figure 2a), the
slope of ln([H 2O2]/[H 2O2]0))f(t) will not be constant, and
the rate of decomposition of H 2O2will deviate from the
pseudo-first-order kinetic law. This is in good agreementwith our experimental and simulated data (Figure 3b). Forthe experiment carried out at pH 3.0 and with [H
2O2]0/[Fe-
(III)] 0)4775, the slope of ln([H 2O2]/[H 2O2]0) versus reaction
time increases during the course of the reaction until [H 2O2]/
[Fe(III)] becomes lower than 500. On the other hand, adecrease of the slope of ln([H
2O2]/[H 2O2]0))f(t) can be
observed when [H 2O2]/[Fe(III)] becomes lower than 50.
The results of this study show that our model adequately
simulates the complex kinetics of decomposition of H 2O2by
Fe(III) in homogeneous aqueous solution. Nevertheless, themodel can only be used for reactions conducted in HClO
4/
NaClO 4solutions since the presence of other inorganic anions
(chloride, sulfate, ...) might have a significant effect on thedistribution of ferric complexes and therefore on the overallrate of decomposition of H
2O2.
