Abstract
Growth and survival of postlarval abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino fed different diatom diets were examined for one
month from settlement. Two diatoms, Amphora luciae Cholnoky and Navicula cf.lenzii Hustedt, supported high postlarval
growth and survival, especially when supplied in combination. A third species, Nitzschia laevis Hustedt, did not support
survival for more than two weeks as a unialgal diet and had limited value in mixed diets.
Diatom mixtures were superior to single-species diets as of the first week after settlement. The mixture of N.cf. lenzii andA.
lucia supported the highest survival, up to 50%, and growth rate up to 36 Am of shell length per day, reaching a size of 1.4mm
30 days after settlement. The three diatom species contained high levels of total lipids (6.4%–14.5% of dry weight) and fattyacids (16%–22% of lipids); from 39% to 48% of fatty acids were polyunsaturated (PUFA). The three diatoms were richer in n-3
PUFA than in n-6 PUFA. The content of the essential fatty acid 20:5n-3 (EPA) was highest among the PUFAs and higher,
though not significantly, in the two diatom species A. luciae andN.cf.lenzii that produced the better results. Among the free
amino acids, arginine was dominant in N. laevis , proline in N.cf.lenzii , and both free amino acids plus glutamic acid were
equally dominant in A. luciae . The suitability of A. luciae andN.cf. lenzii for enhancing growth and survival of postlarvae was
attributed to their complementary balanced nutritional properties.

1. Introduction
Benthic diatoms are the principal food source for
postlarval abalone in hatcheries ( Kawamura, 1996,
Kawamura et al., 1998a ). In spite of the increasing
number of studies on the nutrition of newly settledabalone larvae ( Kawamura and Takami, 1995; Kawa-

www.elsevier.com/locate/aqua-onlinemura, 1996; Kawamura et al., 1998a,b; Daume et al.,
1999, 2000; Roberts et al., 1999; Searcy-Bernal et al.,2001 ), growth and survival rates during the early
postlarval stages as reported in the literature are vari-able and generally low ( Searcy-Bernal et al., 1992 ).
Poor and unpredictable performance is related tovariability in food (different diatoms and their com-position), as well as to abalone species and the grow-
ing conditions in hatcheries ( Kawamura et al., 1998a ).
To improve growth and survival of abalone postlarvalstages in a specific growing system using specificdiatom species, a better understanding of their basicdiet requirements is necessary. Cell density, digestionefficiency, ingestibility, extra-cellular products, andassociated bacteria are known to affect food value ofdiatoms in early postlarval stages ( Kawamura and
Takami, 1995; Kawamura et al., 1995, 1998a,b;
Roberts et al., 1999; Searcy-Bernal et al., 2001 ).
The biochemical composition of algal cells is anotherimportant factor ( Dunstan et al., 1994 ), but its effect
has been examined mostly in juvenile abalone ( Mer-
cer et al., 1993; Mai et al., 1994, 1995a,b, 1996 ) rather
than in newly settled postlarvae.
The biochemical composition of the diet is most
important once the postlarvae acquire the capability
to digest and benefit from diatom cell content ( Kawa-
mura et al., 1998a ). According to them, the diatom diet
has little impact on growth rates during the first twoweeks after settlement. Diet-dependent postlarvalgrowth rates diverge at 800 Am SL, when the postlarvae
begin digesting and utilizing the cell content. Accord-ing to Daume et al. (1999) , differences in growth rates
by postlarvae fed different diatoms can already be
observed earlier, a week following settlement.
The nutritional value of microalgae as a feed is
influenced to a great extent by the fatty acid composi-tion of their lipids ( Brown et al., 1997; Renaud et al.,
1999 ) and to a lesser extent by sugar composition
(Chu et al., 1982 ). The protein amino acid composi-
tion of microalgae is generally conserved ( Brown et
al., 1996 ) and is unlikely to account for major differ-
ences in the nutritional value of a particular species(Brown, 1991; Brown and Jeffrey, 1995; Brown et al.,
1997 ). Free amino acids (FAA) may constitute a sig-
nificant proportion of the total amino acids in the algalcell ( Dortch et al., 1984; Brown, 1991 ) and their
composition does vary among algal species ( Derrien
et al., 1998 ). FAA are easily absorbed by postlarvae(Manahan and Jaeckle, 1992 ), a fact that is especially
important in very early life stages, before the completedevelopment of the gut enzymes involved in proteindigestion ( Takami et al., 1998 ). For this reason the
diatom composition phase of the present study hasfocused on FAA and fatty acids.
Diatoms, as a class, offer high levels of lipids and
PUFAs, especially the essential PUFA 20:5(n-3)
(Dunstan et al., 1994; Brown et al., 1997 ), and there-
fore may fulfill the nutritional requirements of abalonepostlarvae better than other algae. Polyunsaturatedfatty acids (PUFA) of both n-3 and n-6 families areessential for growth of juvenile Haliotis discus hannai
(Mai et al., 1996 ). Their primary function is consid-
ered to be structural ( Mai et al., 1995a; Floreto et al.,
1996 ). Among PUFAs, 20:5(n-3) seems to contribute
the most to faster growth of juvenile H. discus hannai
(Mai et al., 1996 ).
The aim of this research was to investigate growth
and survival of H. discus hannai postlarvae fed differ-
ent diets of diatoms (including local species), whichhad previously been shown to induce larval settlement(Gordon et al., 2004 ), and verify whether these could
be correlated to the diatoms’ nutritional quality.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of abalone postlarvae
Larvae of H. discus hannai were obtained from an
indoor abalone hatchery in Eilat (Red Sea, Israel).
Adults were induced to spawn using ultraviolet light
(Kikuchi and Uki, 1974 ). Fertilized eggs were collected
and transferred into 20-L aquaria at a concentration of12 eggs/ml. To control bacterial growth, an antibiotic(Rafamycin) was added at a concentration of 1.5 mg/L.Larvae were kept at 22 8C with a 12 L:12 D photo cycle
(60–70 Amol photons m
/C02s/C01), for 4–5 days, until
reaching competence. Larval competency on day 5 was
assessed by observing the swimming behavior, as
described by Seki and Taniguchi (1996) . Competent
larvae were used for the growth experiments.
2.2. Diatom cultures
Benthic diatoms were isolated from the Red Sea
(Eilat, Israel) and from the Atlantic Ocean (Massachu-N. Gordon et al. / Aquaculture 252 (2006) 225–233 226Download English Version:
