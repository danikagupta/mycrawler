Available online 17 January 2019To develop a novel lignin-based highly ef ﬁcient nitrogen fertilizer, the amination of the biore ﬁnery technical lig-
nin was conducted by Mannich reaction synergy with phenolation pretreatment. Subsequently, the structural
transformations of lignin samples and the reaction mechanism were investigated in detail. The soil columnleaching experiment was also performed to research the nitrogen release behavior of aminated lignin in soil.
The results indicated that the amounts of active sites in lignin were signi ﬁcantly increased to 8.26 mmol/g
from the original 2.91 mmol/g by phenolation. In addition, the Mannich reaction was highly selective for occur-ring at ortho -a n d para-positions of phenolic hydroxyl groups in the phenolated lignin, in which the latter was
favored. Moreover, the nitrogen content in the aminated lignin was highly depended on the types of amination
reagent instead of the proportion of reactants in this study. Under an optimal condition, aminated lignin with a
high nitrogen content (10.13%) and low C/N ratio (6.08) could be obtained. Besides, it was especially noteworthythat the prepared APL in this study has a favorable nitrogen release behavior in soil. Thus, it is believed that these
aminated lignin derivatives could be used for the preparation of various lignin-based highly ef ﬁcient nitrogen
fertilizer.

1. Introduction
With the industrial development and total population growth, the
global depletion of fossil fuels is gradually increasing, which has re-
sulted in not only the scarcity of petrochemical but also serious environ-
mental issues (environmental pollution, global warming etc.).
Therefore, there is an immediate need to exploit sustainable and eco-
friendly new energy sources [ 1]. The lignocellulosic biomass, as the nat-
ural and renewable resource, exists abundantly in nature and is consid-
ered to be a promising candidate to replace fossil fuels [ 2,3]. Recently,
with the extensive application of the concept for converting biomass
into biofuels, the modern biore ﬁnery industry is rapidly developed.
Meanwhile, large amounts of biore ﬁnery technical lignin as a by-
product are generated [ 4]. Unfortunately, due to the complex structure
and low chemical reactivity, the application of lignin was severelyrestricted [ 5,6]. Only less amount of technical lignin was applied to pro-
duce value-added products, while the most of them were simply burned
as low grade fuels or directly discarded as wasters [ 7]. The low-value use
pattern not only caused adverse environmental impact, but also de-
creased signi ﬁcantly the use ef ﬁciency of biomass and economic bene ﬁt
of biore ﬁnery process, which have beset these biore ﬁnery enterprises
for a long term. Thus, it is vital to explore new approach for the high-
value utilization of lignin.
Actually, previous researches working on lignin valorization have
veriﬁed that the biore ﬁnery technical lignin possesses a large potential
to be utilized for preparing various lignin-based functional materials
[1,2,5]. For example, the lignin could be used as a substitution for the
commercial polyol to prepare lignin-based rigid polyurethane foam
due to the presence of numerous hydroxyl groups in the structure of lig-nin [8]. Moreover, the lignin, as a low-cost, eco-friendly and renewable
natural polymer materials, is also able to be applied for preparing vari-
ous adsorbents, which exhibits an excellent adsorption capacity and re-
moval rates for the heavy metals or dyes in the wastewater [ 9–13].
Furthermore, the lignin possesses a certain degree of antioxidant abili-
ties, which was mainly attributed to its methoxy and phenolic hydroxyl
groups [ 14]. Consequently, lignin could act as an antioxidant addition toInternational Journal of Biological Macromolecules 127 (2019) 544 –554

ﬁlm [15]. Besides, it is especially notable that lignin, the natural urease
inhibitor, could effectively inhibit the activity of urease in the soil.
Thus, urea is retained in the soil by lignin for a longer period [ 16]. Mean-
while, as a humic acid precursor substance, lignin could be thoroughly
degraded into humus by soil microorganisms, thereby raising soil or-
ganic matter content as well as soil fertility [ 17,18]. These favorable
properties enable lignin to be a promising raw material for the prepara-
tion of highly ef ﬁcient nitrogen fertilizer [ 19,20].
In the past two more decades, lignin has been applied to prepare var-
ious slow release fertilizers [ 19,21–23]. In general, they can be classi ﬁed
into two major categories: the lignin-based coated fertilizer and lignin-
based organic- N-compounds fertilizer [ 24,25]. For the ﬁrst category,
urea granules are commonly coated by spraying a mixture of lignin
and various types of addition agents, such as rosins and linseed oil
[20]o rs t a r c h[ 24], in the surface of urea granules. However, due to
the poor ﬁlm forming properties and low water resistance, the slow re-
lease capacity of lignin-based coating is limited. Therefore, to obtain a
better slow release effect, the double-coated technology and modi ﬁca-
tion of lignin, such as esteri ﬁcation or Mannich reaction, was also ad-
ministered [ 19,25]. For the second category, the current approach is
mainly to introduce nitrogen into the structure of lignin via
ammoxidation [ 26,27]. Actually, the Mannich reaction, as one of the
most important fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, is also an ef-
ﬁcient approach to introduce amine groups into lignin, which has been
widely applied in the modi ﬁcation of lignin and the chemosynthesis of
lignin-based functional materials [ 28–31]. Nevertheless, due to the
low chemical reactivity and less reactive sites in the lignin, the aminated
lignin has a relatively low nitrogen content, which severely restricted itsapplication in fertilizer industry. Therefore, to introduce more amine
groups, the activation of lignin must be performed before the Mannich
reaction, which mainly includes phenolation [ 28], depolymerization
[32] and demethoxylation. As compared to the other activation
methods, the phenolation, which could graft phenol onto the lignin
and thereby increase dramatically the content of active sites, is the
most ef ﬁcient.
Thus, in the present study, the aminated lignin with higher nitrogen
content was prepared by Mannich reaction synergy with phenolation
pretreatment, as an activated method. Subsequently, the structural
transformations of all lignin samples and the reaction mechanismwere investigated in detail by FTIR, various NMR analysis and elemental
analysis. The soil column leaching experiment was also performed to re-
search the nitrogen release behavior of aminated lignin in soil. Besides,
to explore the optimum chemosynthesis condition, the in ﬂuences of
proportion of reactants and types of amination reagent on the nitrogen
content of aminated lignin were evaluated. It is hoped that this study
could facilitate the value-added application of the biore ﬁnery technical
lignin.

Finally, the obtained lignin was directly used as the biore ﬁnery technical
lignin without any further puri ﬁcation. Phenol, 37% formaldehyde aque-
ous solution, 40% dimethylamine aqueous solution, ethanediamine and
diethylenetriamine were all analytical grade and purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Beijing, China).
2.2. Phenolation pretreatment of the biore ﬁnery technical lignin
The phenolation of the biore ﬁnery technical lignin was conducted
under the acidic condition according to the previous literature [ 33].
Brieﬂy, 10 g lignin was dissolved in a certain amount of phenol, and
the weight ratio of lignin to phenol were 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:6 for PL 1,P L 2,
PL3,P L 4, respectively. In addition, the sulfuric acid (5 mL) was also
added to the mixture as a catalyst. Then, the homogenous mixture
was stirred at 110 °C for 20 min. Once the reaction completed, the mix-
ture was slowly added to hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (pH = 2)
under continuous stirring to precipitate the phenolated lignin (PL). Sub-
sequently, the precipitates, termed as PL, were ﬁltered, washed with
acidiﬁed water followed by deionized water until neutral pH, and ﬁnally
freeze-dried. The scheme of the phenolation reaction is showed in
Scheme 1 A.
2.3. Amination of the phenolated lignin
The amination of the phenolated lignin was carried out under alka-
line condition by Mannich reaction ( Scheme 1 B). Speci ﬁcally, 5 g PL
wasﬁrstly dissolved in 10 mL 0.4 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution for
about 10 min under continuous stirring to ensure the suf ﬁcient
dissolution of PL. Then, a certain amount of amination reagent (40%
dimethylamine aqueous solution, ethanediamine or
diethylenetriamine) and 37% formaldehyde aqueous solution were
added, in turn, into the above solution ( Table 1 ). Subsequently, the mix-
ture was kept at a speci ﬁed temperature (60 °C, 70 °C, 80 °C) for a spec-
iﬁed time (3 h, 4 h, 5 h) with continuous stirring. Afterward, the mixed
products were dialyzed using the dialysis tubing with a molecularweight cut-off of 1000 Da. Finally, the aminated lignin (APL) was ob-
tained by freeze-drying.
2.4. Characterizations of L, PLs and APLs
31P,13C,1H, and 2D-HSQC NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
AVIII 400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). To quantify
the OH groups of L and PLs, the quantitative31P NMR spectroscopy was
performed as described in the published literatures [ 34,35]. In detail, a
dried L or PL sample (20 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 mL of solvent (anhy-
drous pyridine and deuterated chloroform 1.6:1, v/v) at room tempera-
ture. After complete dissolution, 0.1 mL of cyclohexanol as an internal
standard (IS) and 0.1 mL of chromium (III) acetylacetonate solution as
a relaxation reagent were added successively. Then, the mixture was
reacted with 0.1 mL of 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-
dioxaphospholate (TMDP) as the phosphorylating reagent. Finally, themixture was vibrated for 10 min to ensure the completion of phosphor-
ylation reaction and transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube for analysis. The
acquisition parameters were pulse angle 30 °C, relaxation delay (d

literature [ 36]. The13C NMR analysis of L and PL was also conducted
after dissolving 140 mg samples in 0.5 mL DMSO- d6. Moreover, Fourier
transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of the L, PLs and APLs were recorded
on a Bruker TENSOR37 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, Michigan, USA).2.5. Thermogravimetric analysis of L and APLs
The Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermogravimetric
(DTG) analysis were conducted by using a thermal gravimetric analyzer
(TGA Q50, TA instruments, Delaware, USA). The samples were heated

ﬁed nitrogen atmosphere.
2.6. Elemental analysis of APLs
The C, H and N contents of all APLs were examined in triplicate by a
PerkinElmer 2400II elemental analyzer (Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts,
USA). The ﬁnal values are the averages of three measurements.
2.7. Soil column leaching experiments
In order to investigate the nitrogen release behavior of APLs in soil,
the soil column leaching experiments were conducted according to pre-
vious literatures [ 37–39]. Simply, the soil was collected from the surface
layer of farmland (0 cm to 20 cm depth) and dried at room temperature
for 5 days after removing the roots of plants. Then, the soil was sieved by
a 2 mm sieve. Subsequently, 700 g dry soil as the lower-layer soil was
ﬁrstly ﬁlled into the bottom of Plexiglas column (inner diameter =
7 cm, height = 25 cm) and the rest dry soil (300 g) mixed thoroughly
with APLs (treatment group) or urea (control group) was ﬁlled into
the top of the Plexiglas column according to the designed soil bulk den-
sity (1.4 g/cm3)(Fig. 1 ). The equivalent dose of 100 mg N kg−1dry soil
was applied at different treatments. Moreover, the surface of each soil
column was covered with a certain amount of quartz sand to minimize
disturbance. Blank experiment (CK) without any fertilizers was also
performed under the same conditions. Each treatment was repeated
for three times.
Throughout the experiment, the soil water content was maintained
at 75% ﬁeld capacity by weighing and adding water if necessary and all
the soil columns were incubated at ambient temperature. After 1, 4, 7,
14, 21, 28, 42, 56 days, 200 mL of deionized water were added slowly
into each soil column and the leachates were collected in 250 mL conical
ﬂask. Then, the leachates were ﬁltered and stored at −24 °C untilchemical analyses. The ammonium (NH 4+) and nitrate (NO 3−) content
were determined by AutoAnalyzer 3 (Bran Luebbe, Hamburg,
Germany) and their cumulative leaching amount were calculated to
evaluate the nitrogen release behavior of APLs in soil. The ﬁnal values
are the averages of three repetitions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phenolation of lignin
In order to increase the content of active sites and introduce more
amine groups into the skeleton of lignin, the phenolation pretreatment
of the biore ﬁnery technical lignin was conducted under acidic condi-
tions. Before the phenolation, the lignin was detailedly characterized
by31P,13C and 2D-HSQC NMR analyses. These results showed there
was a relatively high content of non-condensed guaiacyl phenolic hy-
droxyl groups (1.17 mmol/g) and p-hydroxyphenyl phenolic hydroxyl
groups (0.87 mmol/g) in the L, which contain one and two active sites
for Mannich reaction, respectively ( Fig. 2 andTable 2 ). Therefore, the
biore ﬁnery technical lignin is an ideal raw material for the amination.
After phenolation under different phenol/lignin feed ratios, the signals
between 137.1 and 138.4 ppm, which represent for p-hydroxyphenyl
phenolic hydroxyls, were found to be obviously stronger than that of L
(Fig. 2 ), suggesting that the content of free p-hydroxyphenyl units was
dramatically increased after phenolation process. On the contrary, as
compared to the L, all the PL displayed a relatively weaker signal at
146–149 ppm originating from aliphatic hydroxyl groups, which was
mainly ascribed to the substitution of aliphatic hydroxyl groups by phe-
nol during phenolation [ 28,40], as showed in Scheme 1 A. These phe-
nomena demonstrated the phenol had been successfully grafted onto
the side chain of lignin.
To obtain more evidences about the successful graft of phenol during
the phenolation, the 2D-HSQC NMR analysis was conducted ( Fig. 3 ).
Fig. 4. The13C NMR spectra of L and PL 2. P and O refer to the introduced groups via para-substitution and ortho -substitution of phenol, respectively.548 G.-J. Jiao et al. / International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 127 (2019) 544 –554These signals in the spectra were assigned according to the previous
publications [ 36,40]. From the side-chain region of L and PL, it could
be clearly found that these signals referring to side-chain region (C α-
Hα,Cβ-Hβ,Cγ-Hγ) were mostly vanished and some new signal appeared
atδC/δH45–50/3.5 –4.5 ppm in all the PL, which was due to that the
phenolation occurred in side-chain region of lignin, then the substitu-
tion of functional group (e.g. hydroxyl) in the side-chain region by the
phenol, electron-donating groups, enable the original signal (C α-Hα,
Cβ-Hβ,Cγ-Hγ) in side-chain region to shift to up ﬁeld [40]. Moreover, in
the aromatic region of L and PL, a new signal corresponding to C 2,6-
H2,6in oxidized syringyl units located at δC/δH104/7.35 ppm appeared
in all the PL, which implied that a part of syringyl units would be oxi-
dized under the given conditions. The disappeared signals derived
from p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid in all the PL suggested that
these compounds were removed and cleaved during phenolation pro-cess [ 41]. In addition, the intensity of signals related to p-
hydroxyphenyl units in all the PL were signi ﬁcantly increased as com-
pared to that of raw lignin (L), implying that the phenol has been suc-
cessfully introduced to the lignin. Meanwhile, the signal attributed to
normal S
2,6was also shifted to down ﬁeld after phenolation, which
may suggest that phenolation reaction occurred in side-chain region
of lignin, thereby in ﬂuenced the chemical environment of S 2,6closest
to side-chain region. These results were completely consistent with
the aforementioned31P NMR analysis and demonstrated that the phe-
nol had reacted with lignin successfully.
13C NMR spectra were also given in Fig. 4 to provide some detailed
information about the structural changes of lignin during phenolation.
Firstly, some basic signals referring to S, G and H unit could be detected
in the spectra, mainly including these signals at 152.3 ppm (S 3,5,
etheri ﬁed), 147.6 ppm (S 3,5, non-etheri ﬁed), 137.8 ppm (S 4, etheri ﬁed),
125.4 ppm (S 4, non-etheri ﬁed), 104.4 ppm (S 2,6), 148 ppm (G 3,
etheri ﬁed), 147.5 ppm (G 4,e t h e r i ﬁed), 135 ppm (G 1), 119.2 ppm (G 6),
128.3 ppm (H 2,6), 115.5 ppm (G 5and H 3,5)[36,41]. In addition, it
could be easily found that these signals belonging to the aromatic car-
bon in the PL became stronger than those of L, especially these signals
from H 2,6,G6,G5and H 3,5, which arose mainly from that these new sig-
nals assigned to the introduced groups overlapped partially with these
original signals of lignin, such as P 2,6,O6and H 2,6,a sw e l la sP 3,5,O3
and G 5+H 3,5,a ss h o w e di n Fig. 4 . On the contrary, these signals at
168.1 ppm, 144.3 ppm, 130.2 ppm and 111.7 ppm are attributed to
PCA 9,P C A 7+F A 7,P C A 2,6,a n dF A 2, respectively, but completely cannotbe determined in the spectra of PL 2. An obvious shift of S 2,6from 104.4
to 106.7 ppm indicated that some condensation occurred during acidic
phenolation. Similarly, these signals from 60 ppm to 90 ppm referring
to the side-chain carbon (C α,Cβand C γ) were also shifted to up ﬁeld
(42–55 ppm) after phenolation, implying the attachment of phenol oc-
curred in side-chain region of lignin. These results were in good agree-
ment with the aforementioned 2D-HSQC analysis. Furthermore, some
new signals at 157.5 ppm, 155.4 ppm, 135.9 ppm and 128.5 ppm ap-
peared in the spectra of PL 2, which were originated from the introduced
groups after phenolation. It was especially noted that the signal of P 4at
155.4 ppm was stronger than that of O 4at 157.5 ppm, indicating that
both the para-substitution and ortho -substitution of phenol existed in
the reaction, while the para-substitution was predominant, which was
probably due to the smaller steric hindrance during the para-
substitution [ 42].

Fig. 5. FT-IR spectra of L, PL 2and APL S.549 G.-J. Jiao et al. / International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 127 (2019) 544 –554To accurately quantify various hydroxyl groups and the active sites
in all samples and explore the optimum phenolation condition, the
quantitative data of L and PL from31P NMR analysis was given in
Table 2 . As showed in this table, the only effect of phenol/lignin feed
ratio on the degree of phenolation was investigated in detail and the
110 °C, 20 min were directly chosen as the optimal reaction tempera-
ture and time according to previous literatures [ 33,40]. From this
table, it could be obviously observed that the content of Al-OH was con-
tinually decreased in PL (from 1.31 mmol/g in L to 0.08 mmol/g in PL 4)
with the increase of phenol/lignin feed ratio. Meanwhile, the content of
H-OH exhibited a converse trend from 0.87 mmol/g in L to 3.69 mmol/g
in PL 4. This fact implied that the degree of phenolation was gradually
improved and more phenols could be introduced onto the structure of
lignin by phenolation reaction. In addition, as compared to L, a slight in-
crease in the contents of S-OH and G C-OH as well as a decrease in the
content of G N-OH could be found in all the PL, implying a slight conden-
sation reaction has occurred during the phenolation under the acidic
conditions [ 43]. Furthermore, the amounts of active sites in L and PL
were also calculated. As shown in Table 2 , the amount of active sites
was gradually increased in the PL since more phenols were used during
the phenolation, which was paralleled to the content of H-OH. Never-
theless, it was also noteworthy that the active sites in the phenolatedlignin were only slightly increased after the feed ratio (phenol/lignin)
reached to 2:1, suggesting that the reactive sites for phenolation reac-
tion were nearly saturated in given condition. Thus, considering the eco-
nomic cost of modi ﬁcation, the PL 2instead of PL 4was chosen for the
subsequent amination.
3.2. Amination of the phenolated lignin by Mannich reaction
The APL was synthesized by Mannich reaction under the alkaline
condition ( Scheme 1 B), and different amination reagents as well as pro-
portions of reactants were used during the Mannich reaction ( Table 1 ).
The structural characteristics of the products were analysed by FT-IR
and showed in Fig. 5 . From the infrared spectra, it could be clearly
found that these products exhibited some typical absorption peaks of
lignin. For example, the wide peak at 3404 cm−1is assigned to the hy-
droxyl groups in aliphatic and phenolic structures. The peaks at
2928 cm−1and 2840 cm−1originate from the C \\H asymmetrical and
symmetrical stretching vibrations in methyl and methylene structures,
respectively [ 44–46]. Moreover, the peaks at 1603 cm−1and
1506 cm−1are attributed to the aromatic skeletal stretching vibrations.
The peaks at 1463 cm−1and 832 cm−1derived from C \\H bending and
out-of-plane deform vibrations, respectively [ 46]. In the aromatic
Fig. 7. The 2D-HSQC NMR spectra of PL 2and APL S.550 G.-J. Jiao et al. / International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 127 (2019) 544 –554structures, the peaks at 1260 cm−1and 1220 cm−1are assigned to the
guaiacyl and syringyl structure, respectively, and the peak at
1123 cm−1originates from ether bond in the lignin structure
[21,30,41–43], suggesting that the skeleton structure of lignin was not
destroyed during Mannich reaction. In addition, some obvious change
in the intensity of peaks could be observed in the infrared spectra of
these APL. For example, the intensity of peaks at 2928 cm−1and
2840 cm−1originating from the C \\H stretching vibrations in methyl
and methylene structures was signi ﬁcantly increased after Mannich re-
action, especially in the spectra of APL 9. This was due to the successful
introduction of amination reagent containing numerous methyl and
methylene during Mannich reaction. Besides, since the Mannich reac-
tion occurred at the aromatic region of lignin, the intensity of peaks re-
ferring to C \\H vibrations from the aromatic skeleton of lignin was
markedly decreased in the spectra of APL, such as 1603 cm−1,
1506 cm−1,1 4 6 3c m−1and 832 cm−1. Furthermore, it was noted that
a new peak appeared at 1640 cm−1, arising from the N \\H bending vi-
brations in \\NH2structure [ 30], in the spectra of APL 6and APL 9,i m p l y -
ing that the amine had been grafted onto the lignin structure. However,
this signal was absent in the spectra of APL 3, which was due to the ab-
sence of NH 2structure in the amine group introduced to APL 3, as illus-
trated in Scheme 1 .
1H NMR analysis was also performed to provide more evidence
about the successful introduction of amine groups. As showed in
Fig. 6 , an obvious increase in the intensity of signal from aromatic pro-
ton (6 –8 ppm) was observed in the spectra of PL 2. Subsequently, this
signal was dramatically reduced after Mannich reaction, implying
these amination reagents had successfully reacted with aromatic ring
of PL 2. Moreover, it should be noted that some new signals at
2–3 ppm assigned to the introduced amine groups could be found in
the spectra of APL, which was consistent with the subsequent 2D-
HSQC NMR analysis.
To further investigate the structural transformation of the lignin dur-
ing Mannich reaction, the 2D-HSQC NMR analysis was carried out. As
displayed in Fig. 7 , some new signals arose in the side-chain region of
these lignin derivatives after amination, which were mainly ascribed
to the amine groups introduced during Mannich reaction. The result in-
dicated that these amination reagents had been successfully grafted
onto the phenolated lignin by Mannich reaction. Furthermore, based
on the NMR spectra, it could be found that the Mannich reaction mainlyoccurred at the ortho -a n d para-positions of the phenolic hydroxyl
groups. However, these signals referring to the para-substituted groups
in all APL, e.g. X
3in APL 6, were stronger than those of the corresponding
ortho -substituted groups, e.g. X' 3in APL 6, implying that the para-
substitution was favored during the synthesis of APL, which was proba-
bly due to the smaller steric hindrance in para-positions of phenolic hy-
droxyl groups. Similarly, it is very noteworthy that there are two
different amine groups in APL 9, namely X and Y, as exhibited in Fig. 7 .
Specially, X group holds distinctly dominant position in APL 9as com-
pared to Y group due to the smaller steric hindrance, which could be
proved by the different intensities of the signals assigned to the X and
Y. In addition, in the aromatic region of APL, these signals attributed to
G5and H 3,5almost completely vanished and these signals of G 2,G6
and H 2,6were also slightly shifted to up ﬁeld after amination. The result
demonstrated that these amine groups were introduced to the G 5and
H3,5position of the phenolated lignin by Mannich reaction, which is in
good agreement with the previous report [ 25].
3.3. The thermogravimetric analysis of aminated lignin
The TG and DTG curves of L, APL 6and APL 9were depicted in Fig. 8 .
From the curves, it could be found that the weight loss trends of
aminated lignin were similar to the original technical lignin, which
was consistent with the previous report [ 30]. During the ﬁrst stage (be-
fore 150 °C), the weight loss of aminated lignin was attributed to the
evaporation of residual moisture. Then, when the temperature wasraised from 150 °C to 300 °C, the low molecular weight lignin fragment
would decompose and evaporate from these samples [ 30,47]. As shown
in the DTG curves, two peaks of weight loss rate could be observed at
213 °C ( −1.3%/min) and 255 °C ( −1.6%/min) for L in this stage. How-
ever, the thermal decomposition rates of all aminated lignin were
lower than that of L, and the maximum weight loss rate were −1.2%/
min at 264 °C for APL 6and−1.1%/min at 256 °C for APL 9in this stage,
which may result from the loss of low molecular weight lignin fragment
during the dialysis of aminated lignin. The third pyrolysis stage occurred
at 300 °C –500 °C and the maximum weight loss rates of L, APL 6and APL 9
were attained, respectively, at 351 °C ( −3.3%/min), 361 °C ( −2.3%/min)
and 345 °C ( −2.7%/min), which was due to the cleavage of inter-unit
linkages of lignin and the evaporation of monomeric phenols [ 48]. At
the last stage (above 500 °C), the only slight weight loss could be ob-
served in the TG curves of all sample. The above results implied that
the obtained APL contained more macromolecule and less low molecu-
lar weight lignin fragment, which contributed to improve the slow re-
lease effect of aminated lignin.
3.4. The elemental analysis of aminated lignin
The elemental analysis was also conducted to determine the nitro-
g e nc o n t e n to fa l lA P L s( Table 3 ). It was found that the nitrogen content
of these products (APL 4~ APL 9) was signi ﬁcantly higher as compared
with that of APL 1,A P L 2and APL 3, which was ascribed to the factor that
an ethanediamine or diethylenetriamine molecule contains more nitro-
gen element than a dimethylamine molecule. Nevertheless, when more
ethanediamine or diethylenetriamine were employed during the syn-
thesis process of APL, only slight increase in the nitrogen content of
the product could be observed, which was probably attributed to the
nearly saturated active sites (G 5and H 3,5) as revealed by the aforemen-
tioned 2D-HSQC analysis. In short, these results revealed the type of
amination reagent was a more crucial factor than the proportion of re-
actants to affect the nitrogen content in the products. Furthermore, it
was surprised to note that the APL 5and APL 6possessed higher nitrogen
content than that of APL 9, and the highest nitrogen content (9.65%) ap-
peared in APL 6. Therefore, it could be speculated that ethanediamine is
Fig. 8. TG and DTG curves of L, APL 6and APL 9.551 G.-J. Jiao et al. / International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 127 (2019) 544 –554probably the most ideal amination reagent for the synthesis of high N-
containing aminated lignin as compared to diethylenetriamine and
other long-chain aliphatic amines. In addition, a higher reaction temper-
ature and longer reaction time were also employed during Mannich re-
action to investigate their effect on nitrogen content of product. As
shown in Table 3 , the nitrogen content of APL 10had a noteworthy in-
crease as compared with that of APL 5. However, only a slight increase
in the nitrogen content of product could be detected with the further in-
crease of reaction temperature from 70 °C (APL 10)t o8 0° C( A P L 11). Be-
sides, no signi ﬁcant difference could be observed among the nitrogen
contents in the APL 5,A P L 12and APL 13, suggesting that the longer reac-
tion time had slight effect on the nitrogen content of product. Based
on the above analysis, an optimum chemosynthesis condition wasobtained, namely a feed ratio of 1:3:4 (lignin/ethanediamine/formalde-
hyde) at 70 °C for 3 h during the Mannich reaction.
It was reported that the lignin-based product could be easily de-
graded by soil microorganism and then release the organic
bound ‑nitrogen when its C/N ratio is lower than 20 [ 21]. Thus, to evalu-
ate the biodegradability of these APL in soil, the C/N ratios were calcu-
lated and listed in the Table 3 . The result displayed the C/N ratios of all
the products were much lower than 20, ranged from 6.07 to 12.1, indi-
cating that these APL Spossessed an excellent biodegradability and could
efﬁciently release nitrogen in the soil to meet the nutrient requirements
of plants.
3.5. The nitrogen release behavior of aminated lignin in soil
The nitrogen release behavior of aminated lignin in soil was also in-
vestigated by the soil column leaching experiment. As shown in Fig. 9 ,
the cumulative leaching amount of NH 4+was far less than that of NO 3−
in all treatments, which was due to the loss of NH 4+by volatilization
of NH 3or a fast oxidation from NH 4+to NO 3−by nitri ﬁcation in soil
[38]. Moreover, it could be found from the Fig. 9 that when the urea
was used as the nitrogen fertilizer, most of nitrogen was released
quickly into the soil environment within 28 days, which was not syn-
chronous with the nutritional demand of the plants, thereby possibly
resulting in not only serious loss of nitrogen by leaching and volatiliza-
tion but also the nitrogen starvation of crops in the later growth stage
[19,22,38]. In addition, only slight difference about the cumulative
leaching amount of total nitrogen could be observed between the
aminated lignin and blank group (CK) in the ﬁrst 28 days. This phenom-
enon suggested that the obtained aminated lignin included less low mo-
lecular weight fragment with poor slow release effect, which was in
good agreement with the TG analysis. Furthermore, it was especially

APL 13 63.37 6.11 9.62 6.59552 G.-J. Jiao et al. / International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 127 (2019) 544 –554noteworthy that the cumulative leaching amounts of NH 4+and NO 3−
from treatments groups (APLs) were gradually increased after 28 day,
while only a slight change could be found in the control group
(U) and black experiment (CK) at the same stage. These results indi-
cated the aminated lignin began to degrade and release slowly the ni-
trogen in soil environment after 28 days, thus could supply nutrient
for the crop in a long period, which is complementary with pure urea.Therefore, it is believed that the obtained aminated lignin has a great
potential to be used as the controlled release component in the prepara-
tion of lignin-based coated urea fertilizer and matrices fertilizer
[19,25–27], which would facilitate the value-added application of
bioreﬁnery technical lignin.
4. Conclusions
The present study showed that the chemical reactivity of lignin was
signiﬁcantly improved by phenolation. The type of amination reagent
instead of the proportion of reactants was the main factor for in ﬂuenc-
ing the nitrogen content of the product during Mannich reaction. Addi-
tionally, ethanediamine is regarded as the most favorable among these
selected amination reagents. Furthermore, an optimal product with
high nitrogen content (10.13%) and low C/N ratios (6.08) was obtained
under a feed ratio of 1:2 (lignin/phenol) at 110 °C for 20 min during the
phenolation and a feed ratio of 1:3:4 (lignin/ethanediamine/formalde-
hyde) at 70 °C for 3 h during the Mannich reaction. In addition, it was
especially noteworthy that the prepared APL in this study has a favor-
able nitrogen release behavior in soil. Therefore, it is believed that this
study could facilitate the application of lignin in fertilizer industry,
thereby extend the lignin valorization in the biore ﬁnery process.
