In this study the adsorption of New Methylene blue (Basic blue 24) on sawdust of Malus domestica  
was investigated. The sawdust was chemically treated to enhance the adsorption capacity. Adsorp -
tion experiments were performed at different temperatures ranging from 20–40°C on both raw and 
treated sawdust samples. The residual concentration of the dye was determined by UV-Vis spectro -
photometric technique. Effect of various reaction parameters like temperature, initial dye concen -
tration, equilibration time and pH was studied. Sawdust was characterized by BET, FTIR, Scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM), and Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. Adsorption 
kinetics was interpreted using intra particle diffusion and Bangham models and both models were 
found to best describe the sorption of New Methylene blue onto M. domestica . Thermodynamic 
parameters like ∆E°, ∆H°, ∆S° and ∆G° were calculated from the adsorption kinetics data. The data 
show that the adsorption is an endothermic process. The negative value of entropy shows that the 
dye molecules take an oriented position on the adsorbent surface. Adsorption data fitted well with 
Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin adsorption isotherms. All results clarify that M. domestica  saw -
dust is a useful cheap adsorbent for removing basic dyes.

1. Introduction
With the advent of the synthetic dyes, dyeing industry 
has changed remarkably attributed to the cheap production 
and widespread application in different industries including 
paper, printing, leather, food, cosmetics, fabrics and plastic 
etc. [1]. Though highly useful and applicable on domestic as 
well as industrial scales, these dyes are toxic, carcinogenic 
and are considered as major group of pollutants in aquatic 
ecosystems [2,3]. Due to their ubiquitous use in the afore -
mentioned industries, it is likely that they make their way through industrial effluents, to the water bodies initiating 
an eco-toxic process and bioaccumulation. Dyes have com -
plex molecular structures containing aromatic rings, which 
are stable and resistant to biodegradation. Basic dyes are 
utilized in the textile industry due to their bright color, high 
solubility in water, cost effective production and good per -
formance upon application to fabric [3,4,5]. New Methylene 
blue (Basic blue 24) is a cationic basic dye causing serious 
health hazards to human and animal’s eyes and in some 
cases could lead to mental confusion [6–9]. Attributed to 
these risks, it is mandatory to remediate New methylene 
blue before they enter water bodies. Many approaches have 
been used for this purpose including membrane filtration, S. Naz et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 166 (2019) 72–8273
ion exchange, biological degradation, photo-catalytical deg -
radation, reverse osmosis, adsorption [10,11]. The adsorp -
tion has proved to be an effective technique for removal of 
dyes by adsorption onto agricultural residues has attracted 
significant attention [12,13]. Activated carbon is the most 
commonly used adsorbent; the steps of activation and 
regeneration are delicate and too costly, limiting its use. The 
importance of finding renewable, inexpensive, abundant 
and easy to handle adsorbents is necessary. Several adsorp -
tion studies of dyes on bioadsorbents have been carried out 
such as the wood sawdust [11 ], orange tree sawdust [14,15], 
raw Algerian kaolin [16]. As to the author’s knowledge, no 
reports on sawdust of M. domestica as a low-cost adsorbent 
for basic dye removal can be found. The approach is worth 
studying attributed to the fact that this sawdust is cost effec -
tive, abundantly available involving easy and environment 
friendly treatment. Thus, this study highlights the use of 
sawdust of M. domestica, an agricultural waste, for effective 
removal of New methylene blue from aqueous solution via 
batch experimental set up.
2. Experimental 
2.1. Materials
New Methylene blue supplied by BioM Laboratories, 
Cerritos USA (Chemical Division Malaysia) was used as 
adsorbate. New Methylene blue (C.I. 52030) having molec -
ular formula C18H22ClN3S and molecular Weight 416.05 g 
possesses λmax of 630 nm and is water soluble. All chemicals 
used in this study were of analytical grade purchased from 
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. A stock 
solution of methylene blue was prepared and different 
working solutions were prepared in order to draw calibra -
tion curve .
2.2. Sawdust treatment
M. domestica sawdust was treated with excess of stan -
dardized 0.5 mol/L NaOH solution for 24 h to remove the 
color elements. The sample was thoroughly washed with 
distilled water and neutralized with 0.5 mol/L HCl solu -
tion. The sample was again washed with double distilled 
water to neutral pH and was dried in an oven at 105 ± 2°C till complete dryness. For comparison purpose, equal 
amount of sawdust was used without such treatment. 
2.3. Characterization of adsorbent 
Specific surface area of the adsorbent was determined 
using Brunner Emmett and Teller (BET) method. Scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate surface 
morphology of M. domestica  while elemental composition 
was determined by Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). 
FTIR was used to find out the functional groups and chem -
ical constituent of the sawdust.
2.4. Adsorption studies 
2.4.1. Equilibrium time
Equilibrium time studies were carried out with two dif -
ferent initial dye concentrations. 0.2 g of treated sawdust 
and 20 cm3 of New Methylene blue solutions were shaken 
in thermostat water bath shakers at 25 °C for time period of 
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h. pH was noted before and after exper -
iment. The change in dye concentration was determined 
with UV-visible spectrophotometer. All the experiments 
were carried out in triplicate. The quantity of dye adsorbed 
(DΦ mol·g–1) was calculated with the help of Eq. (1).

Φ−=  (1)
where Do and Dσ are initial and equilibrium concentration 
(mol·dm–3) of dye respectively.
2.4.2. Adsorption kinetic experiments
A mixture of 0.2 g M. domestica and 20 cm3 of New Meth -
ylene blue solution was shaken at 20°C, 30°C and 40°C, 
for 5–30 min. The slurry was filtered and the filtrate was 
examined for change in concentration by UV-vis spectro -
photometer. The pH was noted before and after filtration 
with digital pH meter. The dye adsorbed (DΦ mol·g–1) was 
then computed by using Eq. (1) mentioned above.
2.4.3. Adsorption isotherms
Adsorption isotherm studies were carried out at dye 
concentrations (1 × 10–5, 2× 10–5, 3× 10–5 mol·dm–3 etc.) over a 
fixed duration of 1 h equilibrium time. 0.2 g of M. domestica 
and 20 cm3 of New Methylene blue solutions were shaken 
in thermostate water bath shaker at 20°C, 30°C and 40°C. 
Clear filtrate was received by filtering the reaction mixture 
and the remaining dye concentration was determined by 
UV-Vis spectro photometer.
2.4.4. Desorption experiments
The MB loaded M. domestica  was mixed with 3% NaOH 
desorption solution, methanol and distilled water in an 
Erlenmeyer flask, shaken at 25°C for 1 h. The resulting 
suspension was filtrated, washed by deionized water to 
remove unadsorbed New Methylene blue, and dried to get 
regenerated M. domestica sawdust. The adsorption capa -

blue on M. domestica .S. Naz et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 166 (2019) 72–8274
bility of regenerated M. domestica  was investigated in 20 
cm3 New Methylene blue with 0.2 g M. domestica  sawdust 
at 40°C for 1 h. The MB concentrations before and after 
adsorption were measured on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer 
at wavelength of 630 nm. The amount adsorbed was calcu -
lated by using Eq. (1).
2.4.5. Procedure for UV-Vis spectrophotometric analysis
0.01 M stock solution of dye was prepared. From this 
stock solution, various working solutions were prepared 
by using dilution formula. All the standard solutions were 
analyzed in visible range on UV-Vis spectrophotometer 
(Model: UV-1800 240 V). Concentration vs. adsorption was 
plotted to get working curve. All the observations were 
noted against blank distilled water.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of adsorbent
3.1.1. BET analysis
Surface area of M. domestica sawdust was calculated 
using BET method [12]. This process makes use of multilayer 
adsorption of nitrogen gas on adsorbent for surface area deter -
mination. Surface area was found to increase from 150 m2·g–1 (raw) to 355 m2·g–1 (treated) sawdust attributed to treatment 
with NaOH and HCl. The surface became clean and foreign 
constituents were removed which exposed the adsorbent sur -
face for more dye molecules to be adsorbed. Another reason 
for increase in surface area could be the presence of non-polar 
sawdust surface particles at high temperature [13].
3.1.2. SEM/EDS analysis
SEM was used to identify the characteristic morpholo -
gies of M. domestica . The SEM images confirm that the sur -
face of adsorbent have pores of different size and shapes 
(Fig. 2). The EDS spectra of raw and treated M. domestica 
indicate that the surface of both the samples has excess car -
bon, some oxygen. Some amount of calcium was detected 
in raw sample which is absent in treated M. domestica . 
3.1.3. FTIR studies
FTIR spectra of raw and treated M. domestica sawdust 
are given in Fig. 3. Absorption in region from 3500 cm–1 to 
3000 cm–1 are due to the presence of hydroxyl group (-OH) 
stretching [17,18]. The OH-stretching bands in raw and 
treated M. domestica are in regions of 3346 cm–1 and 3334 cm–1 
respectively. The bands at 2908 cm–1 and 2902 cm–1 are char -
acterized to aliphatic -CH3, and -CH2 stretching, mainly due 
to -CH2 groups [19,20]. Peaks at 1732 cm–1 in raw M. domes -

tica is due to C=O or C=C double bonds [21] where a weaker 
peak for C=O stretching might be due the presence of trace 
amounts of ketonic functionalities. Such bands are absent in 
treated M. domestica . The peaks in the region 1500–1600 cm–1 
are mainly due to C=C stretching bonds in benzene rings 
[19,22,23]. Absorption bands at 1240 cm–1 in raw M. domes -
tica, 1228 cm–1 in treated M. domestica indicate the presence 
of C-O bond [19,24,25]. Sharp bands in the region 1000–
1100 cm–1 indicate the presence of minerals in the sample.
3.2. Adsorption studies
3.2.1. Equilibration time and adsorption kinetics
Equilibrium time for sorption experiments were studied 
for a period of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h at 25°C, which show 
that equilibrium was attained in less than 1 h time (Fig. 4). 
Optimum time for complete surface coverage is approxi -
mately 1 h (Fig. 4). Adsorption kinetics of New Methylene 
blue were studied at 20–40°C on raw and treated M. domes -
tica samples. Rate of adsorption in first fifteen minutes was 
fast and then slows down onward due to the maximum 
diffusion into pores of adsorbent (sawdust). Also with tem -
perature rise sorption of dyes on sawdust increases which 
indicate an endothermic process [26].
3.2.2. Adsorption kinetic linear equations
The rate constant for sorption of New Methylene blue 
on dust of M. domestica  was determined by first order rate 
equation.ln ln –o ad D Dkt=⋅σ  (2)
Do and Dσ are initial and equilibrium concentration 
of dye (mol·dm–3) respectively. kad stands for the rate con -
stant and was calculated from the straight line plots of ln 
Dσ vs. t at 20–40°C (Table 1). The values for rate constant 
increased with rising temperature. The R2 value for first 
order equation (0.8–0.99) shows good agreement of the 
data with rate equation. Activation energy for sorption 
was determined by using Arrhenius equation [27] in the 
following form:

 (3)
Ea shows activation energy while k1 and k2 are rate con -
stants. The activation energies for New Methylene blue 
adsorbed on dust are given in Table 1. The data illustrate 
that treated samples show enhanced activation energy 
as compared to raw samples attributed to better contact 
between sawdust surface molecules and dye leading to 
enhanced adsorption. From activation energies the thermo -
dynamic parameters like ΔH° and ΔS° were also illustrated 
(Table 1) using following equations [27].

where k, kB and h are rate constant, Boltzmann constant and 
Plank constant, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters 
indicated that the adsorption process was feasible, sponta -
neous and endothermic under studied conditions [28,29]. 
The negative values of the entropy of activation ( ΔS°) 
showed that randomness or entropy decreased with rise in 
adsorption temperature which means that dye molecules 
attains a stable position (i,e. dye get adsorbed) onto dust 
surface.
4.2.3. Bangham equation
The Bangham equation in linear form is presented as 
Eq. (6) [30].
log log log log  2.303 oo
oD kWtD DW Vσ⋅ = +α− (6)
Here, D is the initial concentration of dye, Dσ is 
adsorbed amount after time (t). Using the intercepts and 
slopes of linear plots (Fig. 5) ko and α are calculated (Table 
2). The plot was found to be linear with good correlation co-efficient (R² > 0.9) indicating the uniform distribution 
of dye into pores of dust and is a pore diffusion controlled 
process [31] .
3.2.5. Parabolic diffusion model (Intra particle diffusion)
Intra particle diffusion implies multi-linearity which 
clarifies the different steps involved in adsorption process 
[32]. According to Morris and Weber parabolic diffusion is 
defined by Eq. (7) below:
1/2 id D kt BΦ=+  (7)
The plot of DΦ vs. t1/2 gives a straight line indicating 
that adsorption of a solute is controlled by the intra par -
ticle diffusion process. As none of plot passes through the 
origin (Fig. 6) indicating that the intra particle diffusion is 
not the only rate controlling step and suggests some degree 
of boundary layer control [33]. The intra particle diffusion 
coefficient ( kid) is given in Table 2 where the R²  (0.999) is 
close to 1 which indicates that this equation is best fitted 
for the New Methylene blue adsorption onto sawdust. It is Table 1

because of the immediate action of most effortlessly adsorp -
tion sites on sawdust surface. It is further believed that the 
process is controlled by external mass transfer combined 
with intra particle diffusion though the later dominates the 
control of adsorption process [29,34].
3.3. Adsorption isotherm studies
Adsorption isotherms studies over sawdust of M. domes -
tica clarify the distribution of dye molecules in between the 
liquid-solid interface [35]. In order to reveal the distribution 
behavior of adsorbent and adsorbate molecules, adsorp -
tion isotherm models, the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin 
and Harkins-jura isotherms were applied. Isotherm con -
stants for various adsorption parameters are given in Table 
4. Results indicate that dye uptake by sawdust particles 
increased with rise of temperature [36] while dye uptake by 
treated sample was greater as compared to raw sample. The 
sensitivity of the adsorption process towards temperature 
indicated that overall procedure is endothermic and adsor -
bent with greater surface area, open pores and high inter -
action for dye molecules demonstrated greater uptake [37].
3.3.1. Freundlich isotherm
This isotherm is commonly used to describe the adsorp -
tion characteristics for the heterogeneous surface [38]. By 
applying Freundlich Isotherm [Eq. (8)] to the adsorption 
data linear plots were obtained as shown in Fig. 7.1ln  ln lnDKDnΦσ=+  (8)
Values of the parameters n and K were calculated from 
the plots (Fig. 7) and are displayed in Table 4. Constant n 
provides information about surface morphology, heteroge -
neity and its ability to adsorb solute [39]. Large value of 1/n 
represents the efficiency of the adsorbent toward adsorbate. 
1/n > 1.0 demonstrates the solute concentration adsorbed is 
greater than that present in the solution [40]. The values of 
constant, K (mol·g–1) show adsorption capacity of sawdust 
samples. The sorption ability of sawdust increased with 
increasing temperature. It is also indicative of the heteroge -
neous surface of the sawdust.
3.3.2. Langmuir isotherm
The Langmuir isotherm describes quantitatively the for -
mation of a mono layer on the outer surface of the adsorbent, 
and after that no further adsorption takes place. The linear 
form of Langmuir isotherm shown in Eq. (9), was applied to 
adsorption isotherms data and the plots are shown in Fig. 8.

b is the amount adsorbed (mol/g) consequent to a whole 
mono layer coverage, kl (L/g)  is binding energy constants 
and is (0 ˂ kl ˂ 1) which confirms that the used adsorbent 
is favorable for New Methylene blue dye uptake [41]. The

Fig. 7. Freundlich isotherm plots for New Methylene blue on (A) raw and (B) treated M. domestica .S. Naz et al. / Desalination and Water Treatment 166 (2019) 72–8278
linear plots of Dσ/DΦ (g dm–3) against Dσ (mol dm–3) give the 
values of Kl and b (Table 4).
The plot in Fig. 8 demonstrates that the Langmuir 
equation provides description of the experimental data 
which is confirmed by the high values of correlation coef -
ficients (Table 4). The driving force for such a tendency 
is represented by the Gibbs free energy ( ΔGo) [42]. Neg -
ative values of free energy ( ΔGo) for the systems indicate 
spontaneity of the adsorption process. Gibbs free energy 
was calculated as suggested by Yu Lin [43] using Eqs. (10) 
and (11).
 TAK bM≈  (10)
 ln  o
T G RT K∆ =−  (11)
where b (mol·g–1) is Langmuir mono layer adsorption capac -
ity and MA is molecular weight of the dye. The data in Table 
3 show that ΔGo values decrease with increase in tempera -ture, which reveals spontaneous nature and direct relation 
between adsorption uptake and temperature [13,44].
3.3.3. Temkin isotherm
The linear type of Temkin isotherm is given by Eq. (12) 
below [42] 
ln ln DDσ =β α+β  (12)
By plotting D against ln Dơ, straight curves are obtained 
with slope β and intercept β ln α (Fig. 9). The values of ‘ B’ 
increase with increase in temperature from 20 to 40°C (Table 
4) indicating enhanced adsorption at higher temperature. 
Close to 1 values of R2 suggest the best fitting of Temkin iso -
therm for uptake of New Methylene blue by sawdust [43,44].

The Harkin-jura adsorption isotherm is represented by 
Eq. (13) [45]:

obtained a straight line with a negative slope (Fig. 10) and 
there was a direct relation between B and temperature.
The sorption of New Methylene blue is assumed to be a 
little complex process due to the formation of multi layers on 
sawdust surface. The difference of sorption activity is expected 
with different surface coverage [47]. The data obtained were 
well fitted with Freundlich model under different concentra -
tions studied indicating that heterogeneous surface conditions 
exist under the current experimental conditions.
3.4. Effect of sawdust dosage and solution pH
The influence of the pH on the adsorptive behaviour 
of dyes onto various adsorbent was considered previously 
[5,14,33,52–54]. pH is an important parameter influencing 
the adsorption capacity of adsorbent, since it affects the 
surface charges of adsorbent and the ionization degree of 
dye molecule. It was noted that when adsorption of MB was 
performed below pH 4 and pH 3, the pH somewhat raised 
after adsorption. Therefore, basic cations on the surface 
of adsorbent would exchange with proton in the solution 
under strong acidic conditions by suppressing exchange of MB cation [53]. While above pH 5 and pH 4, the pH of solu -
tion decreased after adsorption, which indicated that pro -
ton on the surface of adsorbent should exchange with MB 
cation under weakly acidic and nearly neutral conditions 
[52]. In our experiment the pH values were not adjusted. 
The pH was observed before and after adsorption process. 
The pH noted before adsorption was 7.42, owing to the 
higher cation exchange capability of New Methylene blue 
with proton of the M. domestica  sawdust results in decrease 
of solution pH to 6.43 when noted after adsorption.
Futher, the adsorption rate of dye increased with 
adsorbent dosage, as more adsorption sites were available 
[14,52]. New Methylene blue absorption onto M. domestica  
sawdust increases with increasing sawdust dosage (Fig. 11). 
In addition, treated M. domestica  generally exhibited higher 
adsorption efficiency than raw M. domestica  using the same 
sawdust dosage.

dust declared the surface has oxygen containing functional Table 4

groups, dominantly hydroxyl groups. The oxygen-func -
tional groups participate in adsorption of cationic dyes 
by hydrogen bonding and ion exchange [54]. The H-bond 
interaction of New Methylene blue with the sawdust 
should contribute to the adsorption. As New Methylene 
blue existed as cation in aqueous solution and the sawdust 
surfaces was negatively charged, electrostatic interactions 
should be involved in the adsorption process. The cation 
exchange of New Methylene blue with proton of the saw -
dust occurred at pH 7, demonstrated by a decrease of pH 
after adsorption.
The investigation of the kinetics and mechanism of basic 
dye, New Methylene blue onto M. domestica  wood sawdust was further analyzed by applying pseudo-first order kinetic 
model, Bangham model and intra particle diffusion model. 
The kinetics of sorption processes is concerned with forces 
between sawdust sites and dye molecules, and this forms an 
important area of surface chemistry. The experimental data 
was found to follow the pseudo-first order kinetics with 
relatively high correlation co-efficient. The plot for Bang -
hum model was found to be linear with good correlation 
co-efficient (R² > 0.9) indicating the uniform distribution of 
New Methylene blue into pores of sawdust and suggesting 
a pore diffusion controlled process on M. domestica  surface. 
Similarly, parabolic diffusion model indicating that adsorp -
tion is controlled by the intra particle diffusion process 
but intra particle diffusion is not the only rate controlling 
step involving some degree of boundary layer control 
process. Besides, the type of adsorption (physisorption or 
chemisorption) can also be determined by the magnitude of 
ΔHo, whereby low magnitudes of ΔHo are characteristic of 
physisorption. Therefore, the new Methylene blue adsorp -
tion onto M. domestica  is a physisorption process owing the 
low magnitude of ΔHo (Table 1). The comparison of adsorp -
tive removal of basic dyes on various bioserbents is also 
listed in Table 5.

According to the resource and economic standpoint, the 
adsorbents re-usability is a crucial factor that needs to be 
considered during the selection of adsorbent. The adsorp -

m2·g–1 on treatment with NaOH and HCl. The kinetic anal -
yses show that sorption of New Methylene blue onto dust 
particles follows linear equations and the process is con -
trolled by diffusion. Freundlich and Tempkin equations were 
best fitted to adsorption data while thermodynamic studies 
reveal the endothermic nature of the process. Attributed to 
the cost-effectiveness, easy and abundant availability and 
environment friendly nature of adsorbent ( M. domestica ), It 
can therefore be concluded that saw dust offers promise as 
an economically viable alternative for sequestering of the 
dye from the aqueous solution. The work can be extended 
for the removal of dyes from effluents as well.

in 20 cm–3 (4 × 105 mol.L–1) New methylene blue with 0.2 g 
M. domestica  adsorbent at pH 7 40°C for 60 min with three 
adsorption cycles, in which in every adsorption cycle, the 
sawdust was filtered and oven-dried completely at 80°C 
before reused. The MB concentrations before and after 
adsorption were measured on a UV-vis spectrophotometer 
at wavelength of 630 nm. The adsorbed amount of dye onto 
M. domestica  sawdust was calculated by using Eq. (1). As 
shown in Fig. 11, the efficacy of the M. domestica  towards 
New Methylene blue removal was decreased to about half 
in first cycle and almost ceases in second cycle.
4. Conclusions
In the present study raw and treated M. domestica saw-
dust was used as low cost adsorbent for adsorptive uptake of 
New Methylene blue. The obtained results show that sorp -
tion of basic dye onto raw and treated M. domestica sawdust 
increased  with increase in initial dye concentration, adsor -
bent dose and experimental temperature at neutral pH. 
Surface area of raw sawdust was increased from 150 to 355
