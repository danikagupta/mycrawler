ABSTRACT
Differences inthelength-weight regression coefficient (b)between sexes are
noted forshrimp inoneofthree areas, anddifferences among areas areapparent.
Equations forconverting whole weight toheadless weight andviceversa are
given forthree areas. Theestimating equations differ between theareas. Estimating
equations foreacharea areadequate fordescribing therelation between whole and
headless weights andheadless andwhole weights.
INTRODUCTION
Exploratory research vessels oftheBureau
ofCommercial Fisheries have found royal-
redshrimp, Hymenopenaeus robustus (Smith),
along theupper Continental Slope inthewest-
ernNorth Atlantic from Cape Hatteras, N.C.,
toBrazil (Bullis, 1956; Bullis andCummins,
1963). Population density varies widely
throughout thespecies range, however, and
only three areas withcommercial potential
have been delineated. One lies offtheeast
coast ofFlorida, from St.Augustine toFort
Pierce; another lies south-southwest ofthe
Dry Tortugas; andthethird isofftheMis-
sissippi River Delta from southeast ofthe
Mississippi Passes tooffMobile, Ala.
Commercial harvesting oftheroyal-red
shrimp hasincreased since thediscovery
ofthese areas. During 1967, over 70,000
pounds ofheadless (or"heads off") royal-red
shrimp, valued atmore than $55,000, were
landed. Roe1estimated that thethree areas
could produce annually 1.6million pounds of
20-count whole shrimp.
With thedevelopment ofaroyal-red shrimp
fishery, there isneed forbiological studies.

dition, growth, sexual maturity, andequi-
librium yield interms ofweight. Thispaper
describes thelength-weight relation ofroyal-
redshrimp foreach ofthethree commercial
fishing areas offthesouthern United States.
Statistics oncommercial shrimp fisheries
oftheSouth Atlantic andGulf States arecol-
lected andpublished bytheBureau ofCom-
mercial Fisheries. Shrimp landings aretabu-
lated inunits of"headless" (or"heads off")
weight. Because fishery biologists and in-
dustry personnel need information onboth
totaland tailweight ofshrimp, anappropriate
conversion factor isrequired. Estimates of
headless weight when whole weight isgiven
andwhole weight when headless weight is
given alsoarepresented inthispaper.
MATERIAL ANDMETHODS
Length-weight and total weight -tail weight
equations werecomputed frommeasurements
of1,978 shrimp caught byexploratory re-
search vessels during October andNovember
1965. Ofthese, 1,547 were taken from the
St.Augustine area, 227from theDryTortugas
area, and 204from theMississippi Delta
grounds.
Standardized handling procedures wereused
todecrease variation due tohandling and
processing ofspecimens. Thespecimens were
frozen immediately after capture. Prior to
measurement, thesamples were thawed and
excess moisture wasremoved byblotting with
paper towels. Total length oftheshrimp was
measured tothenearest millimeter, andthe
sexwas determined foreach individual.
Weights ofindividual whole andbeheaded
shrimp were recorded tothenearest one-tenth gram. Thesame techniques were used
tobehead shrimp asarecommonly used in
theshrimp industry. Length-frequency dis-
tributions ofthese samples are given in
table 1.

Indescribing thelength-weight relation,
Iassumed thatweight isanexponential func-
tion oflength. Thisassumption wassubstan-
tiated byplotting samples ofeach setofdata
onlog-log paper. This relation, expressed
empirically asY=aX", wasused inthe
logarithmic form, i.e.,
log,Y=log, a+blog10X
where
Y=total weight ingrams
X=total length inmillimeters
aandbareconstants
Iassumed alinear relation oftheform
Y=a+bXbetween total weight and tail
weight, where
Y=total weight indecigrams
X=tailweight indecigrams
aandbareconstantsLanding statistics aregiven only inunits of
tails perpound and tailweight; however, bi-
ologists frequently require information on
thetotal weight aswell astheheadless weight
ofshrimp. Thus itisnecessary tobeableto
convert from headless tototal weight andvice
versa. Because bothregression equations, one
relating headless towhole weight andanother
relating whole toheadless weight ofshrimp,
are equally important, both equations were
computed.

tions using anunpublished program made

eries Biological Laboratory atGalveston,

sion coefficients (b)formales andfemales of
each area. Theresulting values oftarelisted
intable 2.Nosignificant difference wasnoted
between coefficients formales andfemales in
the St.Augustine andMississippi River Delta
areas.
Theregression coefficients (b)ranged from
3.00 to3.22andfrom 2.82 to2.95forfemales
andmales, respectively. Itappears from these
dataandthevariances oftheregression coef-
ficients (Sb)that theslopes ofthelines for
thefemales inthethree areas were dissimilar;
likewise theslopes ofthelines forthemales
were also dissimilar. Using analysis ofco-
variance onthedatafrom thethree areas,
Idetermined whether theregression coeffi-
cients forfemales differed between areas and
whether theregression coefficients formales
differed between areas. Carrying outthe"F"
test outlined byDixon andMassey (1957), I
obtained F=21.176 withdegrees offreedom
V!=2andV2=1,062 forfemales andF=7.80
withdegrees offreedom Vj=2andV2=905formales. These are significant atthe 1-
percent level. Thus theregression coefficients
forfemales andformales differed statistically
among thethree areas. Fortheconvenience of
thereader, however, Ihave included thetwo
estimating equations using combined female
data andcombined male data toprovide an
overall description ofthelength-weight re-
lation ofthis species. Inaddition, allofthe
datafrom each area andforeach sexwere
combined and asingle estimating equation
wascalculated.
Table 3lists theregression equations for
estimating tailweight (Y)from total weight
(X)andviceversa. Theregression coefficients
forestimating tailweight ranged from 0.551
to0.560 andthose forestimating total weight
ranged from 1.794 to1.905. Because ofthe
difference inthetworegression coefficients
between areas, itwasdesirable todetermine
bystatistical tests whether theslopes ofthe
regression lines within each group were the
same. Using analysis ofcovariance, Icomputed
F=7.694 withVL=2andV2=1,972 degrees
offreedom forpredicting total weight from
tailweight, andF=9.50withthesame degrees
offreedom forpredicting tailweight from
total weight. There isareal difference in
regression coefficients between areas forboth
estimating equations. However, Iprovide a
combined estimating equation for tailweight
andtotal weight.

Iconclude that these equations, using
data from each area, satisfactorily de-
scribe therelation between whole andhead-
less weights and can beused toconvert
values ofeach.
