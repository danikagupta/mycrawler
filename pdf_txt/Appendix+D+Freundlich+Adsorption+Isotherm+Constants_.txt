INTRODUCTION 
 
1-1.  Purpose .  This Design Guide provides practical guidance for the design of liquid and va-
por phase devices for the adsorption of organic chemicals.  The adsorptive media addressed in-
clude granular activated carbon (GAC) and other alternative adsorption carbon media, such as powdered activated carbon (PAC) and non-carbon adsorbents.  
1-2.  Scope.   This document addresses various adsorption media types, applicability, use of 
various adsorption process technologies, equipment and ancillary component design, availability, advantages, disadvantages, regeneration methods, costs, and safety considerations.  The equip-ment can be installed alone or as part of an overall treatment train, based on site-specific factors. 
 
1-3.  Background.   
 
a.  Carbon, in various forms, has been used to adsorb contaminants for some time.  The first 
documented use of carbon as an adsorbent was for medical purposes, in the form of wood char in 1550 B.C.  The first documented use for water treatment was in 200 B.C. “to remove disagree-able tastes.”  In 1785 experimental chemists learned that carbon could accumulate unwanted contaminants from water.  Carbon in the activated form was first used as a filter medium in the late 1800s.  The understanding of carbon adsorption progressed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when vapor phase organic carbon was developed and given its first widespread use as a defense against gas warfare during WWI.  
b.  The first GAC filters used for water treatment were installed in Europe in 1929.  The first 
GAC filters for water treatment in the United States were installed in Bay City, Michigan, in 1930.  In the 1940s, GAC was found to be an efficient purification and separation technology for the synthetic chemical industry.  By the late 1960s and early 1970s, GAC was found to be very effective at removing a broad spectrum of synthetic chemicals from water and gases (i.e., from the vapor phase).

PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION AND THEORY 
 
 
2-1.  Types of Adsorption Media. 
 
a.  Activated Carbon .  Activated carbon can be manufactured from carbonaceous material, in-
cluding coal (bituminous, subbituminous, and lignite), peat, wood, or nutshells (i.e., coconut).  The manufacturing process consists of two phases, carbonization and activation.  The carboniza-tion process includes drying and then heating to separate by-products, including tars and other hydrocarbons, from the raw material, as well as to drive off any gases generated.  The carboni-zation process is completed by heating the material at 400–600°C in an oxygen-deficient atmos-phere that cannot support combustion.  
(1) General . The carbonized particles are “activated” by exposing them to an activating 
agent, such as steam at high temperature.  The steam burns off the decomposition products from the carbonization phase to develop a porous, three-dimensional graphite lattice structure.  The size of the pores developed during activation is a function of the time that they are exposed to the steam.  Longer exposure times result in larger pore sizes.  The most popular aqueous phase car-bons are bituminous based because of their hardness, abrasion resistance, pore size distribution, and low cost, but their effectiveness needs to be tested in each application to determine the opti-mal product.  The three-dimensional graphite lattice pore structure of a typical activated carbon particle is shown in Figure 2-1.  
(2)  Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC).   PAC is made up of crushed or ground carbon 
particles, 95–100% of which will pass through a designated mesh sieve or sieves.  The American Water Works Association Standard (AWWA, 1997) defines GAC as being retained on a 50-mesh sieve (0.297 mm) and PAC material as finer material, while American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM D5158) classifies particle sizes corresponding to an 80-mesh sieve (0.177 mm) and smaller as PAC.  PAC is not commonly used in a dedicated vessel, owing to the high headloss that would occur.  PAC is generally added directly to other process units, such as raw 
water intakes, rapid mix basins, clarifiers, and gravity filters. 
 
(3)  Granular Activated Carbon (GAC).   GAC can be either in the granular form or ex-
truded.  GAC is designated by sizes such as 8 × 20, 20 × 40, or 8 × 30 for liquid phase applica-
tions and 4 × 6, 4 × 8 or 4 × 10 for vapor phase applications.  A 20 × 40 carbon is made of parti-
cles that will pass through a U.S. Standard Mesh Size No. 20 sieve (0.84 mm) (generally speci-
fied as >85% passing) but be retained on a U.S. Standard Mesh Size No. 40 sieve (0.42 mm) 
(generally specified as >95% retained).  AWWA (1992) B604 uses the 50-mesh sieve (0.297 
mm) as the minimum GAC size.  The most popular aqueous phase carbons are the 12 × 40 and 8 
× 30 sizes because they have a good balance of size, surface area, and headloss characteristics.  DG 1110-1-2

The 12 × 40 carbon is normally recommended for drinking water applications where the water 
contains a low suspended solid content.  The 8 × 30 size is the most commonly used for most 
applications (Appendix D, Carbonair). 
 
b.  Non-carbon.   Many alternative adsorption media are in general service today for removing 
organic constituents from vapor and liquid streams.  Organically modified clays, polymeric ad-sorbents, and zeolite molecular sieves are the primary non-activated-carbon adsorbents currently used in hazardous waste treatment (Black & Veatch, 1998).  See paragraph 3-3 for additional information.  
2-2.  Properties of Granular Activated Carbon.
  Granular activated carbon properties are 
defined in ASTM D2652.  In addition to these properties, the following paragraphs provide ad-ditional information.  
a.  Particle Size Distribution.   A standard test procedure for particle size distribution (PSD) is 
defined in ASTM D2862.  Information derived from this test is used to specify the carbon parti-cle size uniformity.  Two particle size criteria are the effective size, which corresponds to the sieve size through which 10% of the material will pass, and the uniformity coefficient, which is the ratio of the sieve size that will just pass 60% of the material to the effective size.  Generally, the rate of adsorption will increase as the particle size decreases, as the process step of diffusion to the carbon surface should be enhanced by the smaller particles.  Note that another critical as-pect of rate of adsorption is the pore size distribution, and development of “transport pores” within the particle that allow effective migration of contaminants to the point of adsorption.  However, particle size may not be that important in all cases, as the porous nature of the carbon particles results in large surface areas in all sizes of carbon particles.  Headloss through a carbon bed increases as the carbon particle size decreases and as the uniformity coefficient increases. 
 
b.  Surface Area.   Surface area is the carbon particle area available for adsorption.  In general, 
the larger the surface area is, the greater is the adsorption capacity; however, this surface area needs to be effective. And a high degree of the area needs to be in the “adsorption pore” region, as well as being accessible to the contaminant with an effective “transport pore” structure, for the capacity to be useful.  This is measured by determining the amount of nitrogen adsorbed by the carbon and reported as square meters per gram (commonly between 500 and 2000 m
2/g).  ASTM 
D 3037 identifies the procedure for determining the surface area using the nitrogen BET (Brun-auer, Emmett, and Teller) method.  Nitrogen is used because of its small size, which allows it to access the micropores within the carbon particle.  
c.  Pore Volume.   The pore volume is a measure of the total pore volume within the carbon 
particles in cubic centimeters per gram (cm
3/g).   
 
d.  Iodine Number.  The iodine number refers to the milligrams of a 0.02 normal iodine solu-
tion adsorbed during a standard test (ASTM D4607).  The iodine number is a measure of the DG 1110-1-2

   2-4 
 volume present in pores from 10 to 28 Å (10–10 m) in diameter.  Carbons with a high percentage 
of pore sizes in this range would be suitable for adsorbing lower molecular weight substances from water.  Carbons with a high iodine number are the most suitable for use as vapor phase car-bons, as water molecules tend to effectively block off and isolate pore sizes less than 28 Å. This restricts mass transfer in the micropores, resulting in poor carbon utilization and excessive cost.  Virgin liquid phase carbons generally have an iodine number of 1000.  Reactivated liquid phase carbon has an iodine number between 800 and 900.  
e.  Molasses Number.   The molasses number refers to the milligrams of molasses adsorbed 
during the standard test.  The molasses number is a measure of the volume in pores greater than 28 Å in diameter.  A carbon with a high percentage of this size pore is suitable for adsorbing high molecular weight substances such as color bodies or other colloids.  Carbons with a high molasses number are generally used for decolorizing process liquids.  As such, the molasses number specification is generally only used in color removal applications, and is not a valid 
specification requirement for water treatment.  This is a proprietary test, and should not be used 
in specifying GAC.  
f.  Abrasion Number.   The abrasion number measures the ability of carbon to withstand han-
dling and slurry transfer.  Two different tests are used, based on the type of carbon material.  A Ro Tap abrasion test is used for bituminous-coal-based GAC, and a stirring abrasion test is used for the softer, lignite-coal-based GAC.  The abrasion number is the ratio of the final average (mean) particle diameter to the original mean particle diameter (determined by sieve analyses) times 100.  The desired average particle size of the GAC retained should be greater than or equal to 70%.  This is of limited value because measuring techniques are not reproducible.  Procedures are given in AWWA (1997) B604.  
g.  Apparent Density.   The apparent density is equal to the mass (weight) of a quantity of car-
bon divided by the volume it occupies (including pore volume and interparticle voids, adjusted for the moisture content).  Generally, bituminous-based GAC has a density between 28–40 pounds per cubic foot (pcf), lignite-based GAC has a density of approximately 22–26 pcf, and wood-based GAC has a density of 15–19 pcf (AWWA, 1997).  
h.  Bulk Density.   The bulk density is the unit weight of the carbon within the adsorber.  Gen-
erally, the bulk density of liquid phase applications is 80–95% of the apparent density and, for vapor phase applications, it is 80–100% of the apparent density.  Apparent density is used to de-termine the volumetric carbon usage rate since the carbon usage rate is typically stated in

2-3.  Isotherms.   An isotherm is the relationship that shows the distribution of adsorbate 
(material adsorbed) between the adsorbed phase (that adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent) and the solution phase at equilibrium.  Media manufacturers are a source of adsorption iso-therms.  Many manufacturers are continuing to conduct research on their products and can often supply chemical-specific adsorption isotherms for their products.  However, many of these com-pany isotherms are batch isotherms used as proof of concept data (i.e., to show that a particular product can adsorb a particular chemical).  Actual working adsorption capacity may be much less than equilibrium batch capacity because other constituents may be present in water, such as total organic carbon, and because of the non-instantaneous adsorption kinetics. So, you should carefully check manufacturer’s data and use them with caution when designing an adsorption system.  The designer should also ask the manufacturer for contacts at installations using the me-dia, so that scale-up factors and common operational problems can be investigated.  
a.  GAC Isotherms.  There are three generally recognized mathematical relationships that were 
developed to describe the equilibrium distribution of a solute between the dissolved (liquid) and adsorbed (solid) phases.  These relationships help interpret the adsorption data obtained during constant temperature tests, referred to as adsorption isotherms.  
• The Langmuir isotherm equation assumes that fixed individual sites exist on the surface 
of the adsorbent, each of these sites being capable of adsorbing one molecule, resulting in 
a layer one molecule thick over the entire carbon surface.  The Langmuir model also as-sumes that all sites adsorb the adsorbate equally. 
 
• The Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) equation also assumes the adsorbent surface is 
composed of fixed individual sites.  However, the BET equation assumes that molecules 
can be adsorbed more than one layer thick on the surface of the adsorbent.  The BET equation assumes that the energy required to adsorb the first particle layer is adequate to hold the monolayer in place. 
 
• The Fruendlich isotherm equation assumes that the adsorbent has a heterogeneous surface 
composed of adsorption sites with different adsorption potentials.  This equation assumes 
that each class of adsorption site adsorbs molecules, as in the Langmuir Equation.  The Fruendlich Isotherm Equation is the most widely used and will be discussed further.

 K, n  = constants that must be determined for each solute, carbon type, and temperature. 
 
(1)  An example of an isotherm for TCE is presented in Figure 2-2.  K and 1/ n or n values 
for multiple contaminant mixtures should be determined by laboratory tests.  
(2)  Single component isotherms may be used for an order-of-magnitude carbon usage esti-
mate or for determining the feasibility of GAC adsorption using suppliers’ literature or previ-ously published literature (Dobbs and Cohen, 1980) for individual compounds.  Another source of liquid phase isotherm data constants is the EPA Treatability Database maintained by the Na-tional Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), formerly known as the Risk Reduction Engineering Lab (RREL) (http://www.epa.gov/tdbnrmrl).  Vapor phase isotherms are not readily available in the literature.  
(3)  Some general rules of thumb, uses, and caveats that are helpful in isotherm interpreta-
tion are as follows: 
 
• A flat isotherm curve indicates a narrow Mass Transfer Zone (MTZ), meaning that the 
GAC generally adsorbs contaminants at a constant capacity over a relatively wide range of equilibrium concentrations.  Given an adequate capacity, carbons exhibiting this type of isotherm will be very cost effective, and adsorption system design will be simplified owing to a shorter mass transfer zone (see Figure 2-2). 
 
• A steep isotherm curve indicates a wide MTZ, with the adsorption capacity increasing as 
equilibrium concentration increases.  Carbons exhibiting this type of isotherm curve tend 
to be more cost effective. 
 
• A change in isotherm slope generally occurs for wastes that contain several compounds 
with variable adsorption capacities.  An inflection point occurs when one compound is 
preferentially adsorbed over another and desorption occurs, so that the preferentially ad-sorbed compound can utilize sites previously used by less adsorbable compounds (see Figure 2-3). 
 
(4) Isotherms can be developed from data obtained in the laboratory and from existing data 
sources, such as the National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) Treatability Database, texts, and suppliers’ literature.  A typical example of TCE isotherm data, which was obtained from the NRMRL database, is provided in Figure 2-2.  A procedure for calculating an isotherm is included in Appendix C.  
b.  Polymeric, Clay, Zeolite Molecular Sieve Isotherms .  Isotherms for these media are devel-
oped in the same way as for carbon media.  However, most of the isotherm data for non-carbon adsorption media must be obtained from the manufacturer or from laboratory tests. DG 1110-1-2

 2-7 
 
  
 
2-4.  Isotherm Testing.   Isotherms are discussed in Paragraph 2-3, and the process for devel-
oping an isotherm is addressed in Appendix C.  Although the example in Appendix C is specifi-cally developed for a liquid phase application, the vapor phase method is similar.  The following paragraphs highlight the types of information that can be obtained from isotherm testing versus column testing.  Isotherms are static, equilibrium tests for a given set of conditions.  Ideally, isotherms should not be used for the final design of a liquid phase system.  Procedures for labo-ratory development of an isotherm are presented in a variety of texts (Benefield, 1982) or as specified in ASTM D 3860.  
a.  Although not advisable for liquid phase applications, published adsorption isotherm data 
are often used to design vapor phase adsorption systems without bench and pilot testing.  For the same contaminant, vapor phase carbon usually has a higher adsorptive capacity than liquid phase carbon, because less adsorptive sites will be taken up by water and humidity.  At a 100% relative humidity, the vapor phase carbon's adsorptive capacity will approach the liquid phase carbon ad-sorptive capacity (Appendix D, Carbonair).  However, you should remember that most published isotherm data represent only a single contaminant in a pure medium, and mixed contaminants may behave differently (see Tables 2-1 and 2-2).  
b.  One source of published isotherms is the Adsorption Equilibrium Data Handbook  
(Valenzuela and Meyers, 1989).  This handbook contains many gas/liquid isotherms.  While most of the isotherms are for activated carbon, there are some for carbon molecular sieves, silica gel, and zeolites.  A source of information on the Fruendlich isotherm equation is the Carbon 
Adsorption Isotherms for Toxic Organics  (Dobbs and Cohen, 1980).  This particular source used 
only a 2-hour test period in lieu of the 24-hour period currently used by industry today. Liquid phase and vapor phase applications are different because the mass transfer characteristics of the two phases are different.  The mass transfer kinetics of a contaminant from the vapor phase to the solid phase is nearly instantaneous, while the mass transfer kinetics from the bulk liquid phase to the solid phase is influenced by the presence of the solute, and may be the rate limiting step in some instances.  There are four phases to the liquid phase adsorption process.  The contaminant must first travel from the bulk liquid phase to the liquid film surrounding the carbon particle.  Second, the contaminant must travel through the liquid film surrounding the carbon to the inter-stitial voids.  Third, the contaminant must diffuse through the carbon voids in the carbon solid phase, and fourth, finally adsorb onto the carbon.  A more comprehensive discussion of the kinetics of adsorption can be obtained from texts (Faust and Aly, 1987).

c.  Liquid phase isotherms are useful screening tools for determining the following: 
 
• If adsorption is a viable technology. 
 
• The equilibrium capacity, or approximate capacity at breakthrough, so a preliminary esti-
mate of carbon usage can be made. 
 
• The relative difficulty to remove individual contaminants if single-constituent isotherms are used, and the identity of the initial breakthrough compound.
 
 
• Changes in equilibrium adsorption capacity relative to the concentration of contaminants 
in the waste stream, and the effects of changes in waste stream concentration. 
 
• The maximum amount of contaminant that can be adsorbed by GAC at a given 
concentration. 
 
• The relative efficiencies of different types of carbons to identify which should be used for 
dynamic testing. 
 
d.  Liquid phase column testing will provide such data as contact time, bed depth, pre-treat-
ment requirements, carbon dosage, headloss characteristics, and breakthrough curves.  Column testing will also identify how contaminants that are not of regulatory concern, such as iron or color containing compounds, will affect the efficiency of the treatment process.

 2-5.  Dynamic Operation Testing.   The following parameters must be considered when 
designing a pilot scale evaluation. 
 
a.  Breakthrough Curves .  The breakthrough curve can be defined as the “ S” shaped curve 
that typically results when the effluent adsorbate concentration is plotted against time or volume.  
Breakthrough curves can be constructed for full scale, dynamic, or pilot testing.  The break-through point is the point on the breakthrough curve where the effluent adsorbate concentration reaches its maximum allowable concentration, which often corresponds to the treatment goal.  The treatment goal is usually based on regulatory or risk based numbers (see Figure 2-4).  
b.  Mass Transfer Zone.   The mass transfer zone (MTZ) is the area within the adsorbate bed 
where adsorbate is actually being adsorbed on the adsorbent.  The MTZ typically moves from the influent end toward the effluent end of the adsorbent bed during operation.  That is, as the adsorbent near the influent becomes saturated (spent) with adsorbate, the zone of active adsorp-tion moves toward the effluent end of the bed where the adsorbate is not yet saturated.  The MTZ is sometimes called the adsorption zone or critical bed depth.  The MTZ is generally a band, between the spent carbon and the fresh carbon, where adsorbate is removed and the dissolved adsorbate concentration ranges from C
O to Ce. 
 
(1)  The length of the MTZ can be defined as LMTZ.  When LMTZ = bed depth, it becomes 
LCRIT, or the theoretical minimum bed depth necessary to obtain the desired removal. 
 
(2)  As adsorption capacity is used up in the initial MTZ, the MTZ advances down the bed 
until the adsorbate begins to appear in the effluent. The concentration gradually increases until it equals the influent concentration.  In cases where there are some very strongly adsorbed compo-nents, in addition to a mixture of less strongly adsorbed components, the effluent concentration very seldom reaches the influent concentration because only the components with the faster rate of movement through the adsorber are in the breakthrough curve.  The MTZ is illustrated in Fig-ure 2-5. 
 (3)  Adsorption capacity is influenced by many factors, such as flow rate, temperature, and 
pH (liquid phase).  The adsorption column may be considered exhausted when the effluent ad-sorbate concentration equals 95–100% of the influent concentration.  This is illustrated in Figure 2-5. DG 1110-1-2

2-6.  Pilot Tests.  Pilot studies are almost always recommended for liquid phase applications.  
After bench scale isotherm tests have provided "proof of concept" data for the media (e.g. GAC), pilot testing should be used to determine if the site-specific conditions will interfere with the me-dia and to test solutions for managing the interferences.  Pilot tests will verify the characteristics of the breakthrough curve at selected process parameters, such as surface loading rates and empty bed contact times.  For example, there may be competition for adsorption sites among dif-ferent compounds in the waste stream.  Analysis for these competing compounds may not be routinely conducted, so their presence and concentration in the waste stream would not be known.  This type of competition can be minimized by selecting a product that selectively ad-sorbs only the compounds of concern.  Also, variations in the water chemistry (pH, buffer capacity, etc.) may affect the performance and capacity of the adsorbent.  Pilot tests should also be used to generate scale up factors for the full-scale design.  
a.  Several manufacturers have mobile pilot systems, and most manufacturers will (for a fee) 
conduct pilot testing of waste streams for customers.  It may be possible to negotiate package deals, where testing costs would be reduced if the pilot scale manufacturer were selected for the full-scale project. 
 
b.  There are two basic types of column tests that can be run to determine the parameters 
mentioned above: the standard pilot column test, and the high pressure minicolumn test.  The standard pilot column test consists of four or more carbon columns in series.  The columns are 50 to 150 mm (2 to 6 in.) in diameter, generally contain 1.8 to 3.6 m (2 to 4 ft) of GAC, and operate in either the downflow or upflow mode.  If suspended solids are a concern for the full scale operation, downflow operation with backwashing capabilities to remove filtered solids is gener-ally the best option.  In an upflow mode, the solids would likely plug most distributors.  The up-flow operation typically generates carbon fines and, thus, gray water.  Downflow mode is gener-ally preferred for liquid streams, unless they are susceptible to biological fouling.  Four pilot col-umns are generally selected to ensure that the wave front or mass transfer zone can be tracked through the columns.  The column operating characteristics (e.g., surface loading rate, detention time, vertical velocity through the bed) should be similar to those expected in the full scale sys-tem.  Typically, in full-scale water-treatment applications, except large potable water plants that have adsorbers operating in parallel, the mass transfer zone is contained in the first adsorber in a system having two adsorbers in series.  In unique process applications, where the contact time is several hours, three beds in series may be necessary.  There are very few systems with four vessels in series.  Methods to apply the data to other conditions, such as the bed depth service time (BDST), and Bohart Adams relationships and operating line method are described in vari-ous references (Benefield, 1982; Faust and Aly, 1987; AWWA, 1997; Erskine and Schuliger, 1971)  A typical pilot column configuration is shown in Figure 2-6. DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001  
 
 
   2-18 
  
c.  A high pressure water minicolumn (HPMC) test or small scale column test was developed 
to reduce the length of time required to obtain operational data from a column test (see Figure 2-6).  A traditional column test could take a month or more to run, while a HPMC test can be com-pleted in a matter of hours.  The HPMC process used is generally manufacturer-specific but de-pends largely upon mathematical modeling, given the particle size used in the HPMC and test parameters and database of past tests, as well as the experience of the individual interpreting the test data.  The apparatus consists of a 0.4- to 2.0-mm-diameter column with a bed depth ranging 
from 10 to 100 mm.  It uses a sample of the subject test GAC, crushed to pass a 60 × 80 mesh or 
smaller.  The minicolumn tests are generally about one order of magnitude less expensive, can be 
completed quickly, require a smaller volume of water, have minimal chance for biological or other deterioration of the sample, and multiple carbons can easily be tested to obtain the most effective design.  Additional information can be obtained from testing labs, carbon manufactur-ers, and AWWA Water Quality and Treatment  (1997).  A typical apparatus is shown in Figure 2-
7.  A procedure for estimating GAC performance using a slightly larger diameter column of 25.4 mm +
 0.1 mm is identified in ASTM D3922. 
 
2-7.  Spent Carbon Management.   Spent carbon has the potential to be regulated for 
disposal under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act  (RCRA).  Spent carbon used to treat 
listed hazardous waste or which exhibits a RCRA hazardous characteristic (ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or exceeding toxicity characteristic leaching procedure threshold levels) must be managed as a hazardous waste after use in an adsorption process and be manifested to a permitted RCRA Treatment, Storage or Disposal Facility (TSDF).  This TSDF may be either a disposal or a  regeneration facility.  If it is managed on-site under CERCLA, a permit is not required, but substantive requirements applicable to TSDFs must be met.  On the other hand, if it was not used to treat listed waste, and it does not exhibit a hazardous characteristic, then the spent carbon can be disposed of or regenerated without being subject to RCRA permitting or manifesting requirements.  The determination of RCRA status is the legal responsibility of the generator (operator/owner) of the treatment facility.  Coordinate with carbon manufacturers, or your local regulatory specialist, for additional information.

 3-1 CHAPTER 3  
APPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS 
 
 
3.1.  Carbon Adsorption. 
 
a.  Liquid Phase Carbon. 
 
(1)  Applications .  Some typical rules of thumb for types of compounds that are amenable 
to carbon adsorption are as follows:  
• Larger molecules adsorb better than smaller molecules. 
 
• Non-polar molecules adsorb better than polar molecules. 
 
• Non-soluble or slightly soluble molecules adsorb better than highly soluble molecules. 
 
• Based on the polarity or solubility, or both, of the molecule being adsorbed, pH may have 
an influence on the extent of adsorption. 
 
• Temperature increases the rate of diffusion through the liquid to the adsorption sites, but 
since the adsorption process is exothermic, increases in temperature may reduce the de-
gree of adsorption.  This temperature effect is negligible in water treatment applications and ambient vapor phase applications. 
 
(2)  Chemicals Adsorbed . The following are examples: 
 
• Alcohols are poorly adsorbed, they are very soluble and highly polar. 
 
• Aldehydes are highly polar, and as molecular weight increases, the polarity decreases, 
and adsorbability increases. 
 
• Amines are similar in structure to ammonia (NH
3) except the nitrogen is bonded to an or-
ganic group.  Adsorption is limited by polarity and solubility. 
 
• Chlorinated armoatics, and chlorinated aliphatics are low-polarity and low-solubility 
compounds, which make them generally quite adsorbable. 
 
• Glycols are water-soluble and not very adsorbable. 
 DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001  
 
 
  3-2 • Higher molecular weight organic compounds will generally be more adsorbable owing to 
adsorptive attraction relative to size. 
 
(3)  Types of Carbon .  Activated carbon is a generic term for a variety of products that con-
sist primarily of elemental carbon.  Numerous raw materials can be used to produce carbons, such as coal, wood, and pitch, and agricultural products such as cotton gin waste and coconut shells.  Materials most commonly used for liquid phase GAC include both bituminous and lignite coal, and coconut shells.  
(a)  Bituminous GAC is the one most frequently used for treating low concentrations of 
low molecular weight organic contaminants in the aqueous phase.  Bituminous coal will also have a more fully developed pore distribution, including “transport pores” that improve the rate of adsorption making it effective for water treatment.  Bituminous GAC has a relatively large surface area, approximately 900 m
2/g, and an apparent density of approximately 0.50 g/cm3 (30 
lb/ft3).  These carbons are usually harder than other types except coconut, and, therefore, are 
more abrasion resistant, and can be more vigorously backwashed without damage.  
(b)  Lignite GAC generally has less total surface area than bituminous GAC.  It is a less 
dense, slightly softer coal, has a higher percentage of meso (transitional) macro pores, and is used more for larger molecules. Therefore, it is used more in decolorizing applications.  Lignite GAC has a surface area of approximately 650 m
2/g and an apparent density of approximately 
0.50 g/cm3 (25 lb/ft3).   
 
(c)  Coconut-shell-based GAC generally has a larger surface area than coal-based GAC, 
and a very large percentage of micropores.  Coconut-shell-based GAC has a surface area gener-ally over 1000 m
2/g and an apparent density of approximately 0.50 g/cm3 (30 lb/ ft3).  Coconut 
shell based carbons may not have the more fully developed pore structure that coal-based car-bons have, because their source is vegetative material. Consideration should be given to rate of adsorption effects in liquid treatment.  It is used primarily in vapor-phase applications.  Coconut-shell-based carbon is slightly more expensive to produce than coal-based GAC, since only about 2% of the raw material is recoverable as GAC, versus 8–9% for coal-based carbons.  
(4)  Isotherms .  Isotherms are discussed in paragraph 2-3. 
 
(5)  Pressure Drop .  Headloss in liquid phase applications varies significantly, depending 
on the piping configuration, carbon particle size, contact time, and surface loading-rate (gener-ally expressed in liters per minute per square meter [gpm/ft
2]).  Typical loading rates are 80–240 
Lpm/m2 (2–6 gpm/ft2); occasionally, loadings up to 400 Lpm/m2 (10 gpm/ ft2) are used.  Load-
ings greater than 240 Lpm/m2 (6 gpm/ft2) generally result in excessive headloss through a typical 
arrangement that has two pre-piped, skid-mounted vessels in series (140 kPa [20 psi] or more primarily from piping losses).  In any case, the manufacturer’s literature should be consulted re-garding the headloss for a specific application. DG 1110-1-2

(6)  Operating Parameters.    
 
(a)  Contact Time .  General rules of thumb for moderately adsorbable compounds such 
as TCE, PCE, and benzene are, first, to go from low ppm levels (approximately 1) to ppb levels requires a minimum empty bed contact time (EBCT) of approximately 15 minutes (some appli-cations have shorter valid contact times given an effective process design), and, second, to go from a medium ppm range (approximately 10) to a low ppb range requires approximately 30 minutes EBCT.  Some typical values are identified in Table 3-1.  EBCT is related to the contac-tor dimensions as follows:  
 
 
      
EBCT orV LA
Q Q=  
where  
 V = bulk volume of GAC in contactor, m3 (ft3) 
 A = cross-sectional bed area, m2 (ft2) 
 L = bed depth, m (ft) 
 Q = volumetric flow rate, L/s (ft3/min). 
  
(b)  Adsorber Volume .  Once the optimum contact time (EBCT) and the carbon usage rate 
are established, the size (volume) of the adsorbers can be determined.  Factors that affect the size of the adsorber include the change out rate as well as the carbon usage rate.  Generally, for car-bon contactor change out, you should consider schedules for other projects at an installation, as well as a reactivation company’s fees, to determine the most cost-effective change out schedule.  Typically, reactivation companies have compartmentalized trucks with a dry carbon capacity of 9100 kg (20,000 lb), which results in a saturated weight of 18,200 kg (40,000 lb), which is the load limit of most roadways.  Off-the-shelf contactors range from 70 kg (150 lb) to as large as 9100 kg (20,000 lb).  Optimum carbon usage should be based on column studies.  The carbon usage rates at different contact times should be evaluated against the higher initial cost of the lar-ger units and higher operation and maintenance costs of the smaller units.  The carbon vessel should have an additional 20–50% bed expansion allowance built in for backwashing the carbon before you place the vessels in service. This expansion allowance is critical in systems where suspended solids are expected, or there is no pre-filtration.  The adsorber volume is then calcu-lated from:

 V  = volume of adsorber, ft3

S.F.  = safety factor to provide extra non-carbon-containing volume for operational 
uncertainty, 1.2–2.5. 
 
(c)  Bed Depth .  Bed depth is a direct function of the contactor diameter and volume.  You 
can solve for the bed depth ( L) knowing the adsorber volume ( V) and adsorber bed area ( A) using 
the equation:  
 
               VL=
A  
 
(d)  Carbon Usage .  Carbon usage can be estimated several ways. One method to estimate 
GAC usage is based on isotherm data using the relationships:

 CUR  = carbon usage rate (g/day) 
  F  = volumetric flow rate of contaminated liquid treated/day (L/day). 
 Relationship 3-1 is generally used to estimate carbon usage for batch systems, and relationship 3-2 is used for continuously operating flow through systems.  For multiple constituent wastes, the constituents with the highest GAC usage rates, up to three, can be summed and the overall CUR  
estimated based on that sum.  See examples in Appendix A for additional information on the size of adsorbers.  Estimates based on isothermal data will only provide a very rough estimate of GAC usage.  In most cases a column test must be performed (see paragraph 2-6).  
(e) Backwashing .  Backwashing is the process of reversing the flow through a media bed 
with enough velocity to dislodge any material caught in void spaces or attached to the media.  
Backwashing is essential before you bring a typical liquid phase downflow pressure column on-
line.  Backwashing removes carbon fines generated during the transfer from the shipping con-tainer to the contactors.  Backwashing also helps naturally stratify the GAC bed, which reduces the likelihood of preferential channeling within the column, and, after future backwashes, helps keep spent carbon at the top of the bed.  Redistribution of the adsorbent within a GAC bed that was improperly backwashed when initially installed could result in extending the mass transfer zone (MTZ), potentially reducing the overall adsorption capacity of the adsorber.  Backwashing a GAC bed prior to placing a new bed into service also helps de-aerate the bed, further reducing the potential for channeling.  Periodic backwashing is usually recommended in the downflow adsorption systems most commonly used at HTRW sites, unless the water treated is low in dis-solved and suspended solids.  Periodic backwashing serves the same purposes that you would ex-pect in any sand filtration system, to remove solids accumulation, reduce biological growth on the media, and reduce the headloss in the bed.  The backwash rate will depend on the carbon density, particle size, and water temperature.  Typically, a 30% bed expansion is accounted for in the design.  This generally requires approximately 6.3–7.4 Lpm/m
2 (8–14 gpm/ft2) at a water 
temperature of 13 °C.  The GAC manufacturer should be contacted to determine the optimum 
backwash rate for the carbon supplied.  A portion of some poorly adsorbed constituents, such as carbon tetrachloride, may be desorbed during backwashing, but strongly held constituents are not affected.  DG 1110-1-2

  3-10  (7)  Equipment .  Generally, steel pressure vessels containing granular activated carbon are 
used.  In water treatment, steel vessels must have a protective internal lining to protect them from the corrosive effects of carbon in water.  This lining should also possess good abrasion resistance to withstand movement of the hard carbon particles.  The treatment systems range in capacity from 70 kg (150 lb) of carbon per unit to 9100 kg (20,000 lb) per unit.  Under certain low-pres-sure applications, fiberglass or other plastic units may be used.  In certain applications, ASME rated pressure vessels may be required.  Units are generally skid-mounted, pre-assembled by the manufacturer, and delivered to the site.  Larger units, i.e., 3 m (10 ft) in diameter, are difficult to ship pre-assembled, so major components, piping, and vessels are assembled in the field.  Piping components are typically pressure-rated to match the vessels and included as part of the skid unit.  A schematic presenting the major components is provided in Figure 3-1.  Criteria for the individual components, such as the distributors, support media, underdrain system, backwash equipment requirements, carbon slurry system, and pumping systems, can be obtained from car-bon manufacturers, or from information contained in Corps of Engineers Guide Specification 11225 :  Downflow Liquid Granular Activated Carbon Adsorption Units , 
http://www.hnd.usace.army.mil/techinfo/cegs/cegstoc/htm.  
(a)  Most liquid phase granular activated carbon systems are operated in series. This 
means passing all of the flow through one column bed, a lead column, and then passing flow through another similar sized column bed, the lag vessel.  This method offers several advantages over a single column.  The series configuration allows the maximum use of the GAC throughout the entire carbon vessel.  This assumes, of course, that the mass transfer zone (MTZ) is contained within a single properly sized carbon unit.  By placing two or more columns in series, the MTZ is allowed to pass completely through the first (lead) bed as the leading edge of the MTZ mi-grates into the second (lag) bed.  By allowing this to happen, the maximum contaminant concen-tration is allowed to come into contact with adsorption sites in the lead vessel that require a greater concentration gradient (differential adsorption energy) to hold additional contamination.  
When the MTZ exits the lead vessel, that vessel is then exhausted, and requires change out with 
virgin or regenerated GAC.  Even though the adsorption capacity of the lead vessel is exhausted, treatment continues in the lag vessel.  Then, during change out, the lead vessel is taken off-line and the lag vessel is placed in the lead position.  The former lead vessel is then replenished with GAC and then becomes the lag vessel and brought on-line.   
(b)  A critical component of the adsorber design is the underdrain (collection) system.  
This underdrain must be designed so that water is collected evenly, such that the mass transfer zone is drawn down in an even, or plug flow, manner to get full value from the installed carbon.  In addition, the underdrain may also be used to introduce backwash water, and, therefore, it should be able to introduce water evenly across the entire bed cross section.  DG 1110-1-2

b.  Vapor Phase Carbon Adsorption.  
 
(1)  Applications .  Vapor phase activated carbon adsorption is used to treat vapor emissions 
from processes such as air stripping (illustrated in the Appendix B examples), soil vapor extrac-tion (illustrated in Figure 3-2, and in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Design Manual, Soil 
Vapor Extraction and Bioventing , EM 1110-1-4001, http://www.environmental.usace.army.mil 
EM 1110-1-4001), thermal desorption, landfill off-gas, treatment process vessels, storage tanks, treatment buildings. and treatment processes (odor control).  
(2)  Chemicals Adsorbed.   Many volatile organic chemicals can be removed from vapor 
streams with activated carbon.  In general non-polar organic chemicals adsorb better than polar organic chemicals, and higher molecular weight organic chemicals adsorb better than low mo-lecular weight organic chemicals.  Examples of hazardous waste chemicals that are easily ad-sorbed are chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and fuel components such as benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylene (BETX).  Examples of chemicals that are not as eas-ily adsorbed are aldehydes, ketones, and alcohols, although these do have better adsorptive char-acteristics than they do in the liquid phase, as solubility in water is not a factor, and adsorption will improve with increasing molecular weight.  Most adsorption of VOCs by activated carbon is exothermic.  The heat of adsorption is especially high with ketones, such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), and aldehydes.  Heat from the vapor phase adsorption of these contaminants has actually built up and ignited bed fires in some installations (Shelly, 1994).  The temperature of the bed should be monitored to prevent a “hot spot ” from igniting a bed fire.  Internal sprinklers are often 
installed in the carbon vessel as additional fire protection when the probability of bed ignition is high.  Another way is to use a CO monitor (Appendix D,TIGG). Low relative humidity (RH) in-creases the capacity of the carbon bed (because under high RH, the water is adsorbed and blinds the carbon).  Manufacturers ’ recommendations on the maximum RH vary from as low as 40% to 
as high as 70%. 
 
(3)  Types of Carbon.   Activated carbon used for vapor phase adsorption is different from 
that designed for liquid phase adsorption.  Gas phase carbon has a larger number of small pores than liquid phase carbon.  
(4)  Isotherms.   See Paragraph 2-3 for an introduction to carbon isotherms.  Isotherms for 
vapor phase adsorption of organic chemicals tend to be based more on calculated theoretical val-ues, rather than on empirical data, which are limited.  They are not as readily available in the lit-erature as those for liquid phase adsorption.  Isothermal data may vary greatly from one carbon series to another or among manufacturers.  As a result, it is necessary to obtain vapor phase iso-thermal data from carbon manufacturers.  The temperature and relative humidity of the vapor stream has a large effect on the adsorption capacity (the isotherms) of the activated carbon.  Car-bon adsorption increases as the temperature decreases.  For example, lowering the temperature from 77 to 32 °F at one site for one activated carbon resulted in increasing the adsorption capacity DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001 
 
 
 3-13  by 35%.  High relative humidity can have a detrimental effect on the adsorption capacity.  The 
difference in capacity from 0 to 100% relative humidity can be as much as a factor of 10.  For example, increasing the relative humidity from 50 to 100% at an HTRW site decreased the adsorption rate from 0.12 g adsorbed per gram of carbon to 0.04 g adsorbed per gram of carbon.  As a result, and since relative humidity depends on the temperature, it is often necessary to deter-mine which combination of temperature and relative humidity is the most cost effective.  Adjust-ing the relative humidity to 40 to 50% is often the best compromise.  Relative humidity above 50 percent may result in adsorbed and condensed water vapor blocking the pores of the particles and interfering with the diffusion of the contaminants to the adsorption pores.  
(5)  Pressure Drop.   Headloss in vapor phase applications varies significantly, depending 
on piping configuration, carbon particle size, and surface loading rate.  Surface loading rate is expressed as ft
3 (m3) of vapor per ft2 (m2) of carbon bed cross-sectional area.  For example, if the 
vapor flow rate is 100 ft3/min (2.83 m3/min.) and the cross-sectional area of the carbon bed is 10 
ft2 (0.929 m2) (i.e., the diameter of the bed is 3.57 ft [1.09 m]), the surface loading rate is (100 
ft3/min)/10 ft2 = 10 ft/min (3.05 m/min).  Typical loading rates are 10 –100 ft/min (3.05 –30.5 
m/min).  A typical pressure drop through a vapor phase carbon bed is 1 to 4 in. of water column per foot of carbon bed (8.3 to 33 cm/m).  In any case, the manufacturer ’s literature should be 
consulted regarding the headloss for a specific application.  
(6)  Operating Parameters.   The major operating parameters needed to design a vapor 
phase carbon adsorption unit are:  
• Vapor stream flow rate. 
 
• Contaminants to be adsorbed. 
 
• Concentration of contaminants 
 
• Temperature of the vapor stream. 
 
• Relative humidity of the vapor stream. 
 
• Desired frequency between carbon bed changes. 
 
• Allowable pressure drop. 
 
(7)  Equipment.   The equipment and units needed in the adsorption process depend on the 
application.  A typical process train consists of piping from the source of the volatile emission stream, such as vapor emissions from a soil vapor extraction unit, an induced draft blower, a heat exchanger, to raise or lower the temperature of the vapor stream (to adjust relative humidity), and carbon adsorption vessel or vessels.  This is illustrated in the design example in Appendix B.  DG 1110-1-2

3-2.  Regeneration, Reactivation, and Disposal of Spent Activated Carbon. 
 
a.  Activated Carbon Regeneration and Reactivation.   This Paragraph presents information on 
reactivation and regeneration, options for spent activated carbon that has been used to treat haz-ardous wastes and industrial process effluents.  
(1)  As contaminants are adsorbed, the carbon ’s adsorptive capacity is gradually exhausted.  
When the carbon ’s adsorptive capacity is reached, it is considered “spent, ” and it must be regen-
erated, reactivated, or disposed of.  Although some manufacturers and researchers use the terms “regeneration ” and “reactivation ” interchangeably, in this document, “regeneration ” means re-
moving the contaminants from the carbon without destroying them and “reactivation, ” which 
occurs at very high temperatures, means destroying the contaminants and reactivating the carbon.  The user must decide which is to be used:  on-site regeneration or reactivation, off-site reactiva-tion, or disposal of the spent activated carbon.  
(2)  Regeneration usually involves removing the adsorbed contaminants from the carbon 
using temperatures or processes that drive the contaminants from the carbon but that do not de-stroy the contaminants or the activated carbon.  A common regeneration process introduces steam into the spent carbon bed, volatilizing the contaminants and restoring the carbon ’s capacity 
to what is called its “working capacity. ”  Steam regeneration does not completely remove ad-
sorbed contaminants.  Another common process uses a hot inert gas, such as nitrogen, to remove the contaminants.  The stripped volatiles are compressed, and recovered as liquid in a condenser.  A third process is pressure swing adsorption.  Pressure swing adsorption uses the fact that ad-sorption capacity is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the contaminants in the sur-rounding environment.  The contaminants are adsorbed at a high pressure (providing higher par-tial pressure of the contaminant to be adsorbed), and then desorbed at a lower pressure where the capacity is reduced.  These regeneration processes are usually run on-site and inside the adsorp-tion vessel.  All regeneration processes produce a waste stream that contains the desorbed con-taminants.  For example, steam regeneration produces a mixture of water and organics from the condensed desorbed vapor.  
(3)  Other than thermal reactivation at elevated temperatures, regeneration techniques will 
result in some contaminants remaining adsorbed and unaltered within the carbon particle.  These contaminants will be occupying “high energy adsorption pores, or sites, ” and lower temperature 
regenerants (<500 °F) or capacity corrections will not be able to provide sufficient energy to re-
verse the adsorptive force.  Carbon having these residual contaminants remaining in the high en-ergy adsorption sites will likely have much shorter runs before breakthrough.  They might even be unable to attain the desired low-level effluent concentrations when placed back on-line, as compared to virgin grade carbons with all of their high-energy sites available for adsorption.  These on-site regeneration techniques are based on capacity recovery processes traditionally DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001 
 
 
  3-16  used in solvent recovery operations and may not be suitable for applications driven by an efflu-
ent objective.  
(4)  Spent carbon reactivation off-site involves removing the adsorbed contaminants from 
the spent activated carbon in a process that is a modification of the one that initially activated the carbon.  The contaminants are desorbed and destroyed in the high temperature (typically in ex-
cess of 1500 °F[800 °C]) pyrolizing atmosphere of the reactivation furnace.  Several types of fur-
naces are available, such as rotary kilns and multiple hearths.  The furnaces can be heated by a 
fuel such as natural gas or fuel oil or by electricity.  Off-site carbon reactivation manufacturers reactivate spent carbon in large capacity (5 to 60 tons/day) furnaces (Schuliger, 1988).  While furnaces of this capacity are not typically cost effective for a single hazardous waste site, smaller furnaces that may prove cost effective are available for on-site use from a number of manufac-turers.  Reactivation furnaces only produce reactivated carbon, air emissions, and some carbon fines.  No organic wastes are produced.  Table 3-2 summarizes the information for on-site regen-eration, on-site reactivation, and off-site reactivation processes.  
b.  Selection Criteria for Determining if Spent Carbon Should be Disposed of,  
Regenerated, or Reactivated.  
(1)  Criteria for Determining When to Use On-site Regeneration, Reactivation or Off-site 
Reactivation, or Disposal.  
 
(a)  On-site reactivation requires space and utility support for the equipment.  It also 
usually requires an air pollution permit for the furnace afterburner.  If the site cannot provide the land or utility support, or if obtaining the required permit is not practical, the spent carbon must be regenerated on-site or reactivated off-site.  
(b)  At some sites, the availability or turn-around times for off-site carbon re-supply may 
be impractical.  In these situations, on-site regeneration or reactivation will be required or the site can provide sufficient storage for both fresh and spent carbon to eliminate the constraint of re-sponse time by outside suppliers.  
(c)  Studies indicate that on-site thermal reactivation is not economical if carbon usage is 
less than 500 to 2000 lb/day (227 to 909 kg/day).  Other studies have found that carbon reactiva-tion unit cost rises rapidly if carbon usage is less than 5000 to 6000 lb/day (2272 to 2727 kg/day) (Pontius, 1990).  
(d)  Because of liability and economic concerns, some design guides recommend that re-
activation should be done off-site whenever possible, regardless of whether land and utilities are available on-site (Faust, 1987). DG 1110-1-2

(e)  Two alternates, which are very common today, are:  
• Have a service come on-site and remove the spent carbon and replace it with virgin or 
reactivated.  This operation usually takes less than one shift. 
 
• Have an extra adsorber on hand and ship the adsorber with the spent carbon to a reactiva-
tor.  The vessel will then be returned with virgin or reactivated carbon on it. 
 
(f)  When carbon is regenerated on-site, some contaminants may not be desorbed.  For 
example, GAC containing organic contaminants with high boiling points may need to be reacti-vated instead of regenerated.   
(g)  In some situations, the loss of adsorption capacity or the rapid breakdown of the tar-
get contaminant, causing an unacceptable decrease in on-line time from the build-up of unregen-erated contaminants, may be unacceptable.  For these applications, reactivation (on- or off-site) will be required. 
 
(h)  The desorbed material produced by on-site regeneration processes may or may not 
be Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) wastes.  In industrial applications, it may be possible to reuse or recycle the desorbed material.  In hazardous, toxic, and radiological waste (HTRW) applications, the desorbed material is usually an unrecyclable mixture that requires proper disposal.  Hazardous waste streams will have to be properly stored, manifested, trans-ported, and disposed of.  If it is not practical to handle a hazardous waste at the site, reactivation (either on-site or off-site) should be considered.  
(i)  Carbon losses during off-site reactivation in the adsorbers and the carbon transfer 
and handling systems can be held to 5 to 7% (Zanitsch, 1997).  Losses within the reactivation furnace should be between 1 and 5%, while potential total reactivation cycle loss rates can range from 3 to over 10%.  Most systems operate with losses of 5 to 7% (Zanitsch, 1997).  However, some researchers estimate that approximately 5 to 15% of the spent carbon is destroyed during each reactivation cycle (Faust, 1987).  One manufacturer states that, in an on-site reactivation system, the losses range from 3 to 8%.  The higher losses are experienced in locations that have a poorly designed carbon handling system, or where the adsorbed organics are difficult to reacti-vate or are strongly adsorbed on the carbon, or both (Appendix D, TIGG).  After the system shakedown is completed and the operators gain experience, carbon losses should decrease to ap-proximately 7% per cycle (Faust, 1987; O ’Brien et al., 1987).  This loss can be replaced by car-
bon from the reactivated carbon pool or with virgin carbon.  It is possible, although unlikely, that an inorganic contaminant in the replacement reactivated carbon might leach out at unacceptable levels in the effluent.  Therefore, if the site must meet inorganic effluent limits, the operator should specify that virgin replacement carbon be used to make up the reactivation losses.  DG 1110-1-2

  3-18  (j)  Regeneration or reactivation will be necessary when no disposal site will accept the 
spent carbon or when the disposal costs would be prohibitive.  
(2)  Criteria for Determining When to Dispose of Spent Carbon.  There are several cases 
where regeneration or reactivation of the spent carbon will not be feasible or will be prohibi-tively expensive.  In these cases, the spent carbon must be disposed of.  
(a)  If the carbon is contaminated by a substance that damages it irreversibly, it must be 
disposed of.  For example, styrene monomer binds to carbon and then reacts to form (polysty-rene) polymers (McLaughlin, 1995).  These polymers blind the small micro pores in the carbon and require extreme reactivation energies.  
(b)  Disposal may be necessary because regeneration/reactivation costs may be prohibi-
tive because of the site ’s location or because of trace contaminants, such as radioactive particles, 
that are also adsorbed.  Care should be taken to compare total costs for both disposal and reacti-vation or regeneration.  This comparison should include:  transportation costs to the disposal or off-site reactivation facility, the cost of the continuing liability for the disposed of spent carbon, the continuing operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for makeup carbon for on- and off-site reactivation, and the capital and O&M costs for regeneration.  The reactivators have trucks with three compartments, so on-site storage tanks are not needed.  In addition, different RCRA regu-lations may apply to the spent carbon and to residuals from the on-site regeneration or reactiva-tion process.  For example, the spent carbon, the slurry water used to move spent carbon, and the water/contaminant mixture condensed from on-site steam regeneration facilities may all be con-sidered RCRA wastes because of the “derived-from ” rule (see 40 CFR 261.3(d)(1) for “derived-
from ” rule for characteristic waste and 40 CFR 261.3(2)(i) for listed waste).  The costs of com-
plying with the appropriate storage, treatment, manifesting, and transportation regulations for these wastes must also be included in the total cost comparison. 
 
(c)  The Micro Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (MCACES), the United States 
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) cost estimating program, along with the Standard Cost En-gineering HTRW Remedial Action-Work Breakdown Structure or the USAF Remedial Action Cost Engineering and Requirements (RACER) system, can be used to estimate the life cycle costs of systems and to compare alternatives.  
c.  Common Design Concerns for Regeneration of Carbon.   Because adsorption vessels and 
the spent carbon storage vessel will be pressurized or put under vacuum, and in some cases heated (as with on-site steam regeneration), the containers must be designed, fabricated, tested, and marked (or stamped) in accordance with the standards of the applicable Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code  (ASME, 1992), and must incorporate pressure safeguards, such as rupture disks.  
Because wet activated carbon is corrosive, the vessel may be built with a corrosion allowance, typically 0.05 in.  Most are protected with sprayed on linings, which range from 10 to 45 mils thick.  An example of a coating used in carbon adsorption or storage vessels is 30 mils of vinyl DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001 
 
 
 3-19  ester.  Other linings are fiberglass polyethylene, Teflon, and kynar.  Once the coating is applied, 
it should be tested electronically to determine if there are any pinholes in its surface.  
(1)  Because granular activated carbon is abrasive, carbon loading and transfer piping and 
pumps should be built with an abrasion allowance.  Carbon loading and unloading piping should avoid long runs, areas of low velocity, radical bends, and low spots without cleanouts, line re-strictions, or restrictive bends (Faust, 1987).  Another concern with piping is corrosion from the waste stream being treated.  Chlorinated organics in vapor can corrode normal steels.  Corrosion resistant materials such as Hastalloy or Alloy 20 may be considered.  
(2)  Wet, drained, activated carbon adsorbs oxygen from the air.  Therefore, all adsorption 
and storage vessels should include provisions to ventilate the vessels, and all inspection man-ways should be designed to support confined space entry procedures.  In particular, the area around the manway should be designed to accommodate a rescue tripod.  The inspection man-ways should also support the use of breathing air supplies (Faust, 1987), either as air supply lines or self-contained breathing apparatuses.  
d.  On-site Regeneration. 
 
(1)  Steam and Hot Inert Gas Regeneration.   Steam and hot inert gas regeneration use the 
same principle.  After the carbon bed reaches the end of its adsorption cycle, it is isolated from the contaminated waste stream.  Steam or a hot inert gas (usually nitrogen) is piped into the adsorption vessel to strip the adsorbed contaminants from the carbon bed.  The steam or gas can flow either counter-current or co-current to the original waste stream's flow.  Currently, most systems use counter-current flow.  The combined steam/contaminant or gas/contaminant is con-densed and pumped to storage or treatment.  Steam and hot inert gas increase the capital costs because more rugged materials are necessary construction and insulation.  
(a)  Steam/hot gas regeneration systems are used primarily to regenerate vapor treatment 
beds, because the additional cost to dry out a water treatment carbon bed (raise temperature enough to vaporize all of the water entrained within the carbon pores) before regeneration makes steam/gas regeneration prohibitively costly.  However, if the bed can be drained and dried before regeneration, steam/hot gas regeneration may be cost effective.  
(b)  Steam is the preferred stripping gas, as it is readily available at many industrial sites; 
however, it may provide lower energy than hot inert gas, depending on the temperature.  If it is not available, skid mounted boiler units are available at relatively low cost.  Steam works espe-cially well with non-water-miscible organics, such as chlorinated solvents.  Non-miscible con-taminants have an added advantage in that they can be separated from the condensed water by gravity.  Steam is less useful for water-soluble contaminants such as alcohols, aldehydes, or ke-tones.  If steam is used for these types of contaminants, the contaminants can be separated from DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001 
 
 
  3-20  the condensate by distillation.  However, distillation raises the O&M costs of the system.  For 
this reason, hot inert gas is preferred for water soluble contaminants.  
(c)  The regenerated bed is cooled, either by piping in cool air or water, or by simple 
radiation.  Once the bed is cool, it is placed on standby or put into service as the polish unit.  If a vapor adsorber was steam regenerated, the carbon bed must be dried before being put back into service.  Conversely, water treatment units that are steam or gas regenerated must be carefully flooded after regeneration to remove any air or gas trapped in the carbon.  
(d)  The advantages of on-site regeneration include the savings from not having to re-
place the 5 to 15% of the carbon destroyed during each reactivation cycle, no need for a carbon change out storage vessel, and the potential for recovery of the organic contaminants, with asso-ciated economic benefits.  At some sites, primarily industrial sites, the recovered material is pure enough to be recycled.  Also, the steam required for regeneration is already available at some sites and can often be supplied at minimal cost.  Disadvantages include the need for storing the recovered contaminants, capital and O&M costs for a boiler if steam is not available, additional capital and O&M costs if hot inert gas is selected (for the gas, and for the condenser/chiller that will be needed), and the possibility that the system ’s carbon will have to be reactivated periodi-
cally anyway, owing to the buildup of contaminants that cannot be removed with steam or hot inert gas.  At hazardous waste sites, there are two other potential disadvantages:  the recovered material may be an un-recyclable mixture or steam condensate that must be properly disposed of, and the recovered material may be a RCRA waste, which must be stored, transported, and mani-fested according to RCRA regulations.  
(e)  The system configuration for steam regeneration must include a boiler, a feed water 
supply and treatment system, provisions for disposing of boiler blowdown, a condenser, a gravity separator, and storage for the recovered contaminants, either a tank or drums.  If a mixture of 
petroleum chemicals and chlorinated solvents is being desorbed, the condensate may form three 
phases.  This may complicate the disposal of the condensate.  Vapor phase units require a source of drying air, such as process gas exiting an on-line adsorber or compressor.  For hot inert gas systems, gas storage must be provided, either in cylinders or tanks, as well as a heater for the gas, a condenser, and contaminant storage.  If economically feasible, an on-site gas generator may also be installed.  Some systems use air as the stripping gas, avoiding the costs of gas storage.  A separator is not usually required for gas systems because the condensate is a single organic phase.  In addition, the carbon adsorbers must be plumbed for steam or the stripping gas, and piping to transfer the stripped contaminants to the condenser.  A fan or pump for the cooling fluid will be needed if the units must be cooled down faster than radiation will permit.  Most of these systems are not designed to be weather-proof and so should be located inside a building and protected from freezing.  A typical process flow diagram for steam regeneration is shown on Figure 3-3. DG 1110-1-2

 3-21   
(f)  If a manufacturer supplied the carbon regeneration system, they will supply the 
operation procedures and initial values for regeneration times and temperatures.  Bench and pilot testing should also provide initial values for these parameters, especially the bed temperature that must be reached for effective regeneration.  However, it must be emphasized that all of these parameters must be confirmed during start up and shakedown of the system.  Even if bench or pilot testing was performed, the full scale system ’s initial values should be varied, because the 
full scale system ’s optimal settings will almost certainly vary to some degree from the optimal 
bench/pilot testing values.  If bench and pilot testing were not performed on the actual waste stream, the initial operational system settings from the manufacturer should be conservatively modified (longer regeneration time and higher final regeneration temperature) until optimum pa-rameters for the full-scale system are determined. 
 (g)  The waste streams from most hazardous waste sites are not concentrated enough to 
generate sufficient heat to ignite the adsorption bed, but if a stream is very concentrated (e.g., soil vapor extraction vapor at the beginning of a remediation), the heat of adsorption should be monitored. 
 (h)  The reported time required to complete a regeneration cycle varied among the 
manufacturers contacted for this study because of a number of variables, including the contami-nant load and the size of the regenerating equipment.  One manufacturer advised that a 2000-lb carbon bed could be regenerated in approximately 3 hours using a 20-hp boiler (Appendix D, Continental). 
 (i)  In-vessel steam and hot inert gas regeneration, even using superheated steam, will 
not reach the temperatures used by reactivation furnaces (at least 1500
oF).  Therefore, only com-
pounds with boiling points less than the temperature reached in the vessel will be completely de-sorbed.  This is not a serious problem if the contaminant stream is relatively pure, e.g., treating groundwater contaminated by a solvent spill.  For a situation like this, the carbon bed can be re-generated by raising its final temperature above the boiling point of the sole contaminant of con-cern.  However, when regenerating with steam, it is not necessary to have the temperature above the boiling point of the contaminants, as steam distillation occurs.  To remove all of the con-taminant higher temperatures are needed. DG 1110-1-2

(j)  If, however, the contaminant stream contains many contaminants, which is the norm 
for groundwater treatment operations at many hazardous waste sites, those contaminants with boiling points higher than the high temperature reached during steam or inert gas regeneration will not be removed.  Because the system operator may not be analyzing for some of the con-taminants that are not being removed during regeneration, the operator may not be aware that these compounds are fouling the carbon.  Over time, these so-called “heavy boilers ” can accu-
mulate on the carbon and reduce its capacity.  Because these compounds tend to have higher molecular weights, they clog the intermediate sized pores in the carbon, blocking access to the smaller pores that adsorb the lighter compounds of concern.  
(k)  Spent carbon can be tested to determine if regeneration is adequately removing the 
adsorbed contaminants.  The overall capacity of the carbon can also be tested.  
(l)  One method of removing these heavy boiler compounds is to send the carbon off-site 
periodically to be reactivated.  Because steam regeneration will remove most of the contaminants of concern, off-site reactivation need not be done very often, perhaps no more than once per year.  The actual off-site reactivation schedule will depend on the volume and composition of the waste stream being treated.  Another removal method is to wash the carbon periodically with a solvent that will dissolve the heavier compounds.  While this method avoids a carbon change out, it generates another waste stream that must be properly analyzed, stored, and manifested for off-site disposal or recycling.  
(m)  The potential for this interference from heavy boilers can be investigated during 
bench or pilot testing if the actual waste stream to be treated is used to test the capacity of the carbon.  The amount of the contaminants of concern adsorbed onto the test columns is routinely checked against the amount desorbed after each run.  If the amount of contaminants of concern adsorbed decreases over several test runs, then it is possible that some unknown contaminant is accumulating on the carbon and decreasing its adsorptive capacity.  If this interference is de-tected during bench or pilot testing, various solvents can be tested to determine their effective-ness in removing the contaminant.  Periodic testing is recommended if the actual waste stream can change.

 3-29  (2)  Sampling Requirements.   The spent activated carbon must be tested before a 
manufacturer will accept it for reactivation.  Toxic characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP) analysis, total volatiles scan, PCB testing, and other testing may be required.  Also, most off-site reactivators need to predict safe and satisfactory reactivation under their furnace operating parameters in order to accept spent carbons.  One manufacturer (Appendix D, NORIT Americas) requires that each spent carbon have a Profile Sheet on file.  To fill out this profile the facility operator would need to know if the spent carbon was a RCRA characteristic waste or a RCRA listed waste, the spent carbon ’s pH, and the 
Department of Transportation shipping name. In addition, the facility operator would have to be able to answer a number of specific questions, such as does the carbon contain Vinyl Chloride regulated under 29 CFR 1910.1017?  
(3)  Manifesting, Transportation, and Placarding Requirements.   When spent car-
bon meets the definition of a D.O.T. hazardous material (i.e., EPA hazardous waste), spe-cific D.O.T. training requirements (49 CFR 172.700) will apply to persons shipping spent carbon off-site.  The classification, management, and off-site disposition of spent carbon  must be coordinated closely with the facility operator, and the installation.  The facility operator will normally be responsible for the preparation of shipping papers, land dis-posal restriction notifications, etc.  The installation personnel will normally sign the paperwork after it is prepared.  Most carbon manufacturers can provide assistance to properly manifest the spent carbon.  The carbon shipper is responsible for complying with all transportation and placarding requirements.  If the material is a D.O.T. hazardous material, D.O.T. transportation requirements apply.  The amount of insurance required per transport should be listed in the contract and reviewed periodically.  Finally, the fa-cility operator must be sure to obtain the appropriate Certificate of Destruction or Reacti-vation from the reactivation facility, listing how the adsorbed organic chemicals were de-stroyed or disposed of.  
(4)  Off-site Carbon Reactivation.  These manufacturers are listed in Appendix D.  
Some manufacturers offer special services, such as segregating, reactivating, and main-taining a facility ’s carbon for that facility ’s own reuse.  Makeup carbon for process losses 
can be obtained from the reactivated carbon pool or can be virgin carbon.  Many users require that the makeup carbon be virgin.  They do not want to take the chance of using carbon from other sources.  However, it is very difficult to ensure complete segregation of small amounts of carbon, i.e., less than10,000 lb, as it moves through a large-scale re-activation process.  Users need to verify that good quality control is employed.  Off-site regeneration also has the advantage of the site receiving a known amount of constituent-grade product and you need not be concerned over quality of product or amount of makeup carbon required.  Table 3-2 summarizes the information on off-site reactivation processes. 
 
3-3  Non-carbon Adsorption. 
 
a.  General .  Modified clay, polymeric adsorbents, and zeolite molecular sieves are 
also currently used in hazardous waste treatment.  Some of these adsorption media are used primarily as pre-treatment for activated carbon.  For example, these media may be DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001 
 
 
  3-30  used to remove compounds that may, through physical or chemical interactions, degrade 
the effectiveness of the activated carbon.  Modified clay is primarily used as a pre-treat-ment for liquid phase systems, between an oil/water separator, and as a treatment process sensitive to emulsified oil, such as activated carbon or reverse osmosis.  Without the use of the modified clay, the oils would blind the carbon, drastically lower its adsorption ca-pacity, increase the cost of operations, and ultimately complicate the regeneration of the carbon. 
 
(1)  The zeolites can also replace activated carbon in several applications.  Research 
indicates that the zeolites are mainly used for high volume vapor stream treatment.  Table 
3-3 summarizes the key differences among the media.  Activated carbon is included for 
reference. 
 
(2)  Some of the polymeric adsorbents appear to be much more selective than acti-
vated carbon.  For waste streams that have only one contaminant of concern, it may be possible to find an alternative adsorbent that is specific to the contaminant.  By only ad-sorbing the single contaminant of concern, the working capacity of the alternative ad-sorbent may exceed the capacity of activated carbon, which loses some of its working capacity to competitive adsorption of other compounds in the waste stream.  Also, for vapor phase applications, some of these alternative adsorbents are less affected by high relative humidity and high temperatures than activated carbon.  For service in these envi-ronments, an alternative adsorbent may be able to provide treatment without pre-treatment of the waste stream. 
 
(3)  Primary selection criteria for using these alternative adsorbents and systems in-
clude the effectiveness of adsorbing the contaminants of concern and the overall lifecycle cost compared to using activated carbon.  For most vapor or liquid service, both the proper alternative adsorbent and activated carbon will adequately adsorb the contami-nants of concern.  The alternative adsorbents usually have higher capital costs and lower operations and maintenance (O&M) costs.  So, for short-term (2 years or less) projects, such as a one time spill remediation, the alternative adsorbent will typically not be as cost effective as activated carbon systems.  For long term projects, the lower O&M costs of the alternative adsorbent can make activated carbon less cost effective.  The Micro Com-puter Aided Cost Estimating System (MCACES), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers cost-estimating program, along with the standard Cost Engineering HTRW Remedial Action-Work Breakdown Structure (RA-WBS) or the USAF RACER system, can be used to calculate the lifecycle costs of these systems and to check on a manufacturer's costs for a system.

(5)  For general information on isotherms, breakthrough, pressure drop, pilot tests, bed

Design information must be obtained directly from the media manufacturer or the ad-sorption equipment supplier.  
b.  Liquid Phase Non-carbon Adsorbents. 
 
(1)  Organically Modified Clays.  This material can be a mixture of anthracite and ben-
tonite clay or bulk clay.  The clay in both media has been treated with quaternary amine, which makes the surface of the clay much more active.  One manufacturer, Biomin, Inc., reports that DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001 
 
 
 3-33  the clay removes emulsified oil and grease, and high molecular weight hydrocarbons, naphtha-
lene, anthracene, COD, BOD, and heavy metals from liquid media.  The material can remove up to 60% of its weight in oil and other organic chemicals; however, it cannot be regenerated.  Dis-posal options include its being used as fuel if the oil adsorbed has sufficient heating value.  Oth-erwise, disposal is governed by the type of organic contaminants the clay has adsorbed.  Typi-cally, the spent material has been incinerated, blended into cement kiln fuel, or treated bio-logically (e.g., landfarming), or placed in a landfill.  
(a)  Modified clay is usually applied as a pre-treatment unit upstream of activated carbon 
or reverse osmosis units that might be blinded by emulsified oil.  While the clay can remove large amounts of free oil, its capacity will be used up rapidly.  Therefore, it is usually put on-line downstream of a gravity oil/water separator, so that the clay's capacity is used on emulsified oil only.  Another application is as a final polish unit after an oil/water separator and before the treatment stream discharge.  
(b)  General specifications, design criteria (such as pressure drop through the system), 
recommended bed depth, hydraulic loading, recommended contact time, bed expansion during backwashing, swelling when wetted, and safety considerations must be obtained from the manu-facturer.  One manufacturer recommends a minimum bed depth of 3 ft, a hydraulic loading of 2 to 5 gpm/ft
2, a contact time of 15 minutes, and a headloss of 1 to 5 in. of water per foot of bed 
when contaminated.  
(c)  No proprietary ownership or use limitations were mentioned in the manufacturers ’ 
data.  The clay swells by at least 10% and sometimes as much as 20% when wetted, so the ad-sorption vessel should not be completely filled with the media.  Also, the spent clay sticks to-gether in “grapefruit ” sized lumps, making it difficult to remove from the adsorber unless there is 
a side wall manhole.  One manufacturer recommends the clay media not be used in fiberglass vessels, as it can be difficult to service these types of tanks once the clay is spent.  
(2)  Polymeric Resin Adsorbents .  There are three primary types of polymeric resins for 
liquid service: carbonized ion exchange resins, divinyl benzene (DB) adsorbents, and post-cross-linked adsorbents.  Table 3-4 compares several features of these different media.  
(a)  Each of these types of resins is manufactured using a different process.  Because the 
manufacturers have greater control over the basic feed stock and processing conditions, these materials can be “fine tuned ” to a greater degree than can activated carbon.  For example, it is 
possible to create carbonized resins with pore structures that will adsorb only contaminants of certain molecular weights.  As with carbon the EBCTs for liquid phase applications are typically much greater than EBCTs for vapor phase applications.  
(b)  Pressure drops through the various media are usually included in the manufacturer 
information.  One manufacturer reports that pressure drops for liquid phase systems ranged from DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001 
 
 
  3-34  1 psi/ft (23 kPa/m) of bed depth for a flow rate of 10 gpm/ft2 to 10 psi/ft (226 kPa/m) for a flow 
rate for 100 gpm/ft2.  Pressure drop from one manufacturer is a function of the velocity of the 
liquid through the adsorption bed raised to a power (i.e., pressure drop = K1 (velocity)K
2).  Manu-
facturers ’ literature often represents this as a straight line on a log-log graph.  Resins are patented 
by their manufacturers.  A license or other agreement is required to use them.  Some resins can be regenerated with steam, but specific information on regeneration must be obtained from the manufacturer.  
(c)  Water temperature is not usually a problem for groundwater and wastewater treat-
ment.  If the contaminated water's temperature is near a specific contaminant's boiling point, however, the resin's desorption kinetics may be so fast that desorption occurs almost as rapidly as adsorption.  In this case, the resin's working adsorption capacity will be too low to adequately adsorb the contaminant.  For example, vinyl chloride is a gas at room temperature.  Vinyl chlo-ride-contaminated waters may have to be cooled, or extra capacity may need to be built into the adsorption bed, in order to get adequate adsorption.  
(d)  Polymeric resins do not tolerate significant biological fouling.  Polymeric resins can 
support biological growth, but the temperature of the steam regeneration (298 °F) is usually suffi-
cient to kill any biological film.  All three primary types of polymeric resins, carbonized ion ex-
change resins, vinyl benzene (DB) adsorbents, and post-cross-linked adsorbents are also used for vapor adsorption.  Table 3-4 compares several features of these different media.  Table 3-5 lists the organic contaminants that can be adsorbed by three manufacturer ’s products. 
 
(3)  Zeolite Molecular Sieves.   Zeolite molecular sieves are not used in liquid applications. 
 
c.  Vapor Phase Non-carbon Adsorbents. 
 
(1)  Polymeric Adsorbents .  Each type of phenolic resin is manufactured using a different 
process.  Because the manufacturers have greater control over the feed stock and processing conditions, it is possible to create carbonized resins with pore structures that will adsorb only contaminants of certain molecular weights.  Divinyl benzene adsorbents are hydrophobic, al-lowing them to be used in high relative humidity environments.  These resins usually have very fast adsorption kinetics, which allows the empty bed contact time (EBCT) of the adsorber to be reduced.  For example, a typical activated carbon EBCT for a vapor phase unit is 2 to 4 seconds.  For a resin vapor phase adsorber, EBCTs can be as little as 0.02 seconds, allowing the designer to use much smaller adsorbent beds.  The advantage of polymeric resins is that they do not react with the contaminants during adsorption to the degree that activated carbon does. For example, activated carbon adsorption is generally an exothermic reaction and there have been instances of activated carbon bed fires while treating highly contaminated streams.  Polymeric adsorbents are much less reactive, allowing for fewer engineered safety controls on the system (Calgon, 1994).   DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001 
 
 
 3-35   
(a)  Pressure drops for gas through the various media must be obtained from the manu-
facturer.  Typical pressure drops for a 40-cfm/ft2 vapor velocity ranged from approximately 4.5 
in. of water per foot of bed depth to 45 in. of water per foot of bed depth.  
(b)  All the resins lose adsorption capacity as temperature increases.  They also lose ca-
pacity as relative humidity increases, but at a lower rate than activated carbons do.  As expected, the hydrophobic resins do better than the hydrophilic resins in high relative humidity service.  
(2)  Zeolite Molecular Sieves.   Zeolite molecular sieves are natural or man-made minerals 
composed of silicon and aluminum.  These media have many of the same advantages as the polymeric resins.  Zeolites are mainly used for high volume vapor stream treatment.  The zeolites can be made hydrophobic, so they can be used in high RH environments.  The engineered zeo-lites can be manufactured with uniform pore diameters, creating materials that selectively adsorb contaminants based on the contaminant's molecular size or weight.  Because they are made en-tirely from inorganic oxides of silicon and aluminum, zeolites can withstand temperatures up to 
800°C in dry air and up to 500 °C in humid or steam environments.  This temperature resistance 
allows zeolites to be regenerated at high temperature with air, eliminating the formation of con-taminated condensate.  Like the resins, zeolites are much less reactive than activated carbon when adsorbing ketones and other reactive organic chemicals.  Also, zeolite's resistance to high temperatures allows the operator to burn off high boiling compounds or polymerized materials, like styrene, from the zeolite without damaging the media.  
(a)  Manufacturers can produce zeolites especially for control of volatile organic chemi-
cals that can adsorb the following organic compounds:  benzene, toluene, xylene, phenol, cu-mene (isopropyl benzene), methylene chloride, trichloroethylene vinyl chloride monomer, al-cohols, aldehydes, nitriles, aliphatics, CFCs, ketones, organic acids, and low molecular weight pesticides.  Large molecules, such as multi-aromatic ring compounds, will not be adsorbed by zeolites because the molecules are too large to fit through the molecular sieve pore openings.  These small pore sizes and the uniformity of pore sizes in the zeolites may prevent fouling by heavy boilers.  The adsorption capacity of the zeolites is approximately 0.1 to 0.15 g of contami-nants per gram of zeolite.  Table 3-6 summarizes this information from UOP, a manufacturer of 
zeolites. DG 1110-1-2

(b)  The zeolites are used in three different applications:  pressure swing systems, tem-
perature swing fixed bed systems, and temperature swing wheels.  
(c)  Temperatures affect the adsorption capacity of the zeolites. Adsorption capacity fell 
from approximately 0.15 g/g 22 °C to approximately 0.12 g/g at 60 °C.  However, as the media 
were designed to operate in very high temperature waste steams, temperature effects above 60 °C 
are not expected to be significant.  In most of the cases, the different RH adsorption curves are relatively similar, indicating no significant loss of capacity at high RH levels.  Again, as the me-dia have been engineered to be hydrophobic and organophilic, this was expected.  
(3)  Organically Modified Clays.   Organically modified clays are not used in vapor appli-
cations.  
d.  Regeneration.   Polymeric media can be regenerated at low temperatures, allowing nearly 
all systems to use on-site regeneration.  Some activated carbon systems must ship the carbon off-site for reactivation.  The polymeric media use a variety of regeneration methods, including hot nitrogen gas or air, microwave or infrared heating, and temperature-vacuum.  These media are usually produced in the form of beads.  The beads have high crush resistance, so attrition during loading and regeneration is usually much less than with activated carbon.  While an activated carbon system can lose up to 12% of the carbon during each reactivation cycle, resin systems can operate at practically zero loss.  For example, when American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) Method D 5159, Standard Test Method for Dusting of Granular Activated Carbon , is 
used to test resins, the amounts of dust generated are so low as to be statistically insignificant.DG 1110-1-2

CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
 
 
4-1.  RACER.  The Remedial Action Cost Engineering and Requirements (RACER) estimating 
software (Talisman Partners, Ltd., 1998) is an adequate tool for developing cost estimates for 
liquid and vapor phase adsorption technologies.  RACER is a parametric cost modeling system that uses a patented methodology for estimating costs.  RACER cost estimating technologies are based on generic engineering solutions for environmental projects, technologies, and processes.  The generic engineering solutions were derived from historical project information, industry data, government laboratories, construction management agencies, vendors, contractors, and en-gineering analysis.  
4-2.  Estimating. To develop an estimate for the liquid or vapor phase technologies within 
RACER, you must at least provide values for required parameters that affect the cost for the 
technology.  These parameters include system redundancy, total organic concentration and safety level.  RACER will also estimate O & M costs for these technologies and spread these costs into the out years for the duration of the O & M.

LIQUID PHASE ADSORBER DESIGN EXAMPLE 
 
 
A-1.  Problem.   Given the following pilot study information, design a liquid phase granular 
activated carbon (GAC) adsorption system for treating RDX-contaminated groundwater. 
 
a. Background data.  
(1)  Given. 
 
• Flow rate:  15.8 L/s (250 gpm) 
 
• Contaminant concentration influent:  69 ug/L 
 
• Contaminant concentration effluent:  4 ug/L 
 
(2)  Determine. 
 
• Surface loading rate. 
 
• Empty bed contact time and number of columns. 
 
• Column nominal diameter and mass of GAC/column. 
 
• Bed depth. 
 
• Volume of water treated per change out period. 
 
b.  Isotherm evaluation . A number of carbons were evaluated on the basis of isotherm results, 
and the most promising carbon was selected for the pilot test and the results of the test are graphically presented in Figure A-1.  A second option to this process is to hire an independent laboratory to conduct accelerated carbon column pilot testing, evaluate several carbons, and rec-ommend one. 
 
c.  Pilot test.   Based on Figure A-1, the number of bed volumes versus the concentration at 
which the effluent reaches our maximum allowable concentration of 4 µg/L is 22,000.  Compar -
ing the number of bed volumes treated using two columns in series, we see the number of bed volumes treated before breakthrough equals 54,000, or approximately 145% more bed volumes than using a single column.  Using two columns in series, each with a detention time of 2 min-DG 1110-1-2

 A-2 utes, means that the first column will be nearly exhausted with the effluent concentration corre-
sponding to 67/69 × 100 = 97% of the influent concentration.  To most effectively use the carbon 
in a system with two columns in series, the detention time in each column should be 6 minutes.  
This will ensure that the lead column GAC is fully exhausted before the adsorption zone passes completely through it and before to the effluent in the lag column reaches the maximum allow-able concentration.  The pilot plant information is provided in Table A-1.

A-2.  Solution. 
 
a.  Surface Loading Rate.   The surface loading rate is given by the pilot test, but as a rule of 
thumb, the rate should be between 80–400 Lpm/m2  (2–10 gpm/ft2).  The range of the pilot is 
near the high side of the range, so the system will be sized to limit the hydraulic loading rate to 310 Lpm/m
2 (7.6 gpm/ ft2), but will be sized to accommodate standard sized vendor equipment.  
The diameter and resultant surface loading rate are calculated below.  
b.  Empty Bed Contact Time (EBCT) (Pilot Test).   The contact times used vary by type of con-
taminant, but generally are in the 2–20 minute range, depending of course on the contaminant.  The 2-minute contact time per column provided by the GAC pilot system limited the potential adsorbance by the GAC.  The pilot data (Figure A-1) indicate a significant increase in the mass of RDX adsorbed per unit weight of carbon based on a minimum contact time of 4 minutes (2 minutes per column times two columns), and an even greater increase for a contact time of 6 minutes.  A contact time based on GAC equipment size with a minimum contact time of 6 min-utes per bed (assuming two beds in series) will be used.  DG 1110-1-2

 A-3 c.  Nominal Column Diameter.   Diameter is equal to the flow rate 15.8 L/s (946 L/m) (250 
gpm) divided by the loading rate, 310 Lpm/m2 (7.6 gpm/ft2) or 3.05 m2 (32.9 ft2), which equates 
to (4 × A/Β)0.5 = 1.97 m (6.5 ft) in diameter.  Referring to manufacturers literature, we find that 
the nearest diameter unit is either a 1.54-m (5-ft) or a 2.4-m (8-ft) diameter unit. A 2.4-m (8-ft) 
diameter unit has an area equal to 4.67 m2 (50.3 ft2), which makes our loading rate = [(946 
L/m)/4.67 m2] = 203 Lpm/m2 (250 gpm/50.3 ft2 or a 5.0 gpm/ ft2 loading rate). This is in the 
normal 80–400 Lpm/m2 (2–10 gpm/ ft2) range. A 1.54-m (5-ft) diameter unit has an area equal to 
1.86 m2 (19.6 ft2), which makes our loading rate = [(946 L/m)/1.86 m2] = 509 Lpm/m2 (250 
gpm/19.6 ft2or a 12.75 gpm/ ft2loading rate). This is above the normal 80–400 Lpm/m2 (2–10 
gpm/ ft2) range.  So, two 8-ft diameter units will be selected. 
 
d.  Bed Depth.   A minimum of 6 minutes/column should be used: 6-minute EBCT × 0.946 m3 
= a minimum carbon contact volume of 5.68 m3 (1500 gal/7.48 gal/ft3 = 200 ft3).  Bed depth is 
equal to the bed volume divided by the column area or 5.68 m3/4.67 m2 = 1.22 m (200 ft3/50.3 ft2 
or 4 ft).  By referring to Figure A-1, we see that the adsorption zone slightly exceeds the 1.22-m 
(4-ft) bed depth (two columns × 0.61 m of GAC/column), and the effluent concentration in the 
first column is slightly less than the influent concentration.  The RDX concentration in the efflu-
ent of the third column does not exceed the 4 µg/L until well into the test (approximately 110,000 bed volumes).  Again, manufacturer literature gives the amount of carbon per bed to be generally about 4535 kg (10,000 lb), which corresponds to a bed depth of 2.3 m (7.5 ft) for the 2.44-m (8-ft) diameter columns.   The resulting EBCT is, therefore:

 APPENDIX B 
VAPOR PHASE CARBON DESIGN EXAMPLES 
 
 
B-1.  Example 1—SI Units.   This example will illustrate the design calculations for sizing a 
vapor phase activated carbon treatment unit.  The treatment train for this example consists of a 
blower, an air stripper, a heat exchanger, and carbon vessels to treat air from the air stripper containing the following volatile organic chemicals (VOC):  perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloro-ethylene (TCE), benzene, and toluene (see Figure B-1).  The water containing the VOCs enters the top of the air stripper column and flows generally downward through the packing material.  At the same time, air flows upward through the column (countercurrent flow).  As water and air contact, the VOCs are transferred from the water phase to the air phase.  The water leaves the bottom of the column depleted in VOCs.  The VOCs that have been transferred to the air exit the top of the column in the air phase.  This air phase then flows through a heat exchanger where it is heated from 289 to 300 K to lower the relative humidity from 100 to 50%.  From here, the air phase flows through vessels filled with activated carbon.  The activated carbon adsorbs the VOCs.  The air phase, depleted of VOCs, is discharged to the atmosphere. 
 
a.  Parameters. 
 
• Flow rate of the air phase entering the air blower:  1 m3/s. 
 
• Temperature of the vapor stream into the blower:  305 K. 
 
• Run time between carbon changes:  3 months/vessel. 
 
• Number of carbon vessels:  two (in series). 
 
• Atmospheric pressure 87.6 kPa (elevation of site approximately 1600 m above sea level). 
 
• Temperature of air phase leaving the air stripper:  289 K. 
 
• Contaminants and their concentrations leaving the air stripper in the air phase: 
 
o Perchloroethylene (PCE):  15 ppmv. 
 
o Trichloroethylene (TCE):  14 ppmv 
 
o Benzene:  9 ppmv. 
 
o Toluene:  5 ppmv.

(4)  Determine the type and size of the blower.  (5)  Determine the type and size of the heat exchanger. 
 
c.  Detailed calculations. 
 
(1)  Determine the amount of carbon needed for 3 months .  For this example, initially as-
sume that two carbon vessels in series will be used.  The air phase from the air stripper will flow through the first vessel (the lead vessel) that adsorbs most of the organic vapors.  The air phase will then flow through the second vessel (lag vessel) and be discharged to the atmosphere.  After the effluent concentration equals the influent concentration, the flow will be redirected first through the lag vessel.  This assumes that the second vessel contains the same amount of carbon as the first vessel.  The lag vessel now becomes the lead vessel.  The other vessel will have the exhausted carbon regenerated or replaced and put back on-line as the lag vessel.  The length of time that a carbon vessel should remain on-line is very site-specific.  In this example, design the system for 3 months between carbon changes of the lead vessel.  It is difficult to determine the exact amount of carbon needed.  Below is a method of estimating the amount of activated carbon that is needed.   DG 1110-1-2

 (a)  Calculate the Partial Pressure of Each Contaminant in the Vapor Stream .  Assume 
that the pressure in the carbon vessel is the same as the discharge pressure (87.6 kPa).  If this pressure is too different from the actual pressure, the partial pressure will need to be recalculated for the correct pressure in the carbon vessels.  The weight of contaminant that can be adsorbed per weight of activated carbon can be estimated from isothermal data supplied by the carbon manufacturer or from the literature (see Paragraph 3-3a).  From these data, the weight of con-taminant adsorbed per weight of carbon was estimated from the Fruendlich isotherm relation-ship:

The values of K and (1/ n) were obtained for one carbon type at 298 K.  These values must be

This calculation is only an estimate of the quantity of carbon required.  Manufacturers recom-mend calculating the carbon needed for the three or four most prevalent constituents and then adding a safety factor.  Safety factors may be as little as 20% more carbon than calculated for non-regenerable systems to as much as 100% for a very conservative design.  Applying this to this example, we can see that the estimated carbon total M becomes:

(2)  Determine the Size of the Carbon Adsorption Vessels . 
 
(a)  Estimate the Diameter of the Carbon Vessel.   The designer often has the option, 
within limits, of using a large diameter vessel that is short or a smaller diameter vessel that is tall.  Both will hold the same amount of carbon.  As a starting point, calculate the diameter for a rea-sonable superficial velocity.  Superficial velocity ( V) is the velocity that the vapor would attain 
through the carbon bed that if this vessel were empty ( V = Q/A, where Q is the vapor flow rate 
and A is the cross-sectional area of the vessel).  Many carbons can be used over a large range of 
superficial velocities.  Manufacturers’ literature lists superficial velocities from 2.5 cm/s to sev-eral hundred.  Typical superficial velocities are 5 to 50 cm/s.  As superficial velocities increase, the pressure drop through the vessel increases.  This results in increased energy costs.  For this example, initially assume a superficial air velocity through the carbon vessels of 25 cm/s.  Cal-culate the resulting diameter D of the vessel as follows:

The carbon vessel is too deep.  By decreasing the superficial velocity through the carbon bed from 25 to 12.5 cm/s and repeating the calculations done in Paragraphs B-1 c(2)(a) and B-
1c(2)(b) above, the diameter of the vessel becomes 3.2 m and the carbon depth becomes 3.6 m.  
These are acceptable (an alternative is to use four vessels 2 × 2).  Vessels available from manu-
facturers will dictate their exact height and diameter.

(d)  Heat Exchanger to Carbon Vessels Piping, Valves, and Instruments .  2.5 cm of H 2O

(e)  Carbon Vessels .  The pressure drop through the carbon bed is a function of the type 
and size of carbon, the velocity of the vapor through the carbon bed, and the depth of the bed.  For one specific carbon in manufacturers’ literature, the pressure drop through the carbon is 6 cm H
2Oper meter of carbon.  For the 3.6-m bed of carbon in this example, the pressure drop is 21 cm 
of H 2O for the lead vessels and 21 cm of H 2O for the lag vessel, for a total of 42 cm of H 2O (see 
Figure B-1).

(4)  Determine the Size and Type of Blower . 
 
(a) Size of Blower .  Design the blower to handle 1 m3/s for the above total system pres-
sure drop.  The exit pressure from the blower is the pressure leaving the carbon units (87.6 kPa) plus the pressure drop through the treatment train.  The blower exit pressure is as follows:

(b) Type of Blower .  High-pressure centrifugal blowers are often used in this type of ap-
plication.  
(5)  Determine the Size and Type of Heat Exchanger .  The relative humidity (RH) of the 
vapor stream entering the carbon vessels should not exceed 40 to 70% (see Paragraph 3-1 b).  A 
heat exchanger is used to raise the temperature (lower the RH) or lower the temperature (raise the RH) as needed.  High RH reduces the adsorption capacity of the carbon.  High temperature reduces the capacity of the carbon.  A good compromise between temperature and humidity is to raise or lower the RH to about 50%.  The type of heat exchanger depends on the amount of DG 1110-1-2 
1 Mar 2001 
 
 
 
  B-9 
 heating or cooling needed.  Assume that in the air stripper the vapor stream is cooled to 289 K 
(the temperature of the water in the air stripper).  Assume the vapor leaving the air stripper is saturated with moisture (100% RH).  A psychrometric chart tells us that the temperature must be raised in a heat exchanger from 289 to 299.8 K to lower the RH to 50%. 
 
• The Fruendlich isothermal data listed in earlier are for 298 K.  In this example, this is 
close to the 300 K vapor temperature of the vapor entering the carbon units.  If the tem-
perature difference is large, the weight of contaminant adsorbed per weight of carbon (x/m) must be determined for the new temperature and all subsequent calculations 
repeated.  
 
• In addition to increasing the pressure, the blower also raises the temperature of a vapor 
stream.  If the vapor goes directly from the blower to the carbon units, the temperature may need to be reduced, not heated, in a heat exchanger.  It is difficult to estimate the temperature rise.  The temperature rise must be obtained from manufacturer's blower literature.

B-2. Example 2—English units.  This example will illustrate the design calculations for 
sizing a vapor phase activated carbon treatment unit.  The treatment train for this example con-sists of a blower, an air stripper, a heat exchanger, and carbon vessels to treat air from the air stripper containing the following volatile organic chemicals (VOC): perchloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE), Benzene, and toluene (see Figure B-2).  The water containing the VOCs enters the top of the air stripper column and flows generally downward through the packing ma-terial.  At the same time, air flows upward through the column (countercurrent flow).  As water and air contact, the VOCs are transferred from the water phase to the air phase.  The water leaves the bottom of the column depleted in VOCs.  The VOCs that have been transferred to the air exit the top of the column in the air phase.  This air phase then flows through a heat exchanger where it is heated from 60°F to 80°F to lower the relative humidity from 100 to 50%.  From here, the air phase flows through vessels filled with activated carbon.  The activated carbon adsorb the VOCs.  The air phase, depleted of VOCs, is discharged to the atmosphere.

• Temperature of the air phase into the blower:  90 °F. 
 
• Run time between carbon changes:  3 months/vessel. 
 
• Number of carbon vessels:  two (in series). 
 
• Atmospheric pressure: 12.7 psia (elevation of site approximately 1 mile above sea level).

(1)  Determine the Amount of Carbon Needed .  For this example, initially assume that two 
carbon vessels in series will be used.  The air phase from the air stripper will flow through the first vessel (the lead vessel) that adsorbs most of the organic vapors.  The air phase will then flow through the second vessel (lag vessel) and be discharged to the atmosphere.  After the efflu-ent concentration equals the influent concentration, the flow will be redirected to flow first through the lag vessel.  This assumes that the second lag vessel now becomes the lead vessel.  The other vessel will have the exhausted carbon regenerated or replaced and put back on-line as the lag vessel.  The length of time that a carbon vessel should remain on-line is very site-specific.  In this example, design the system for 3 months between carbon changes of the lead vessel.  It is difficult to determine the exact amount of carbon needed.  Below is a method of estimating the amount of carbon that is needed. 
 
(a)  Calculate the Partial Pressure of Each Contaminant in the Air Phase .  Assume that 
the pressure in the carbon vessel is the same as the discharge pressure (12.7 psia).  If this pres-sure is too different from the actual pressure, the partial pressure will need to be recalculated for the correct pressure in the carbon vessels. DG 1110-1-2

The weight of contaminant that can be adsorbed per weight of activated carbon can be estimated 
from isothermal data supplied by the carbon manufacturer or from the literature (see Paragraph 3-3a).  From these data, the weight of contaminant adsorbed per weight of carbon was estimated 
from the Fruendlich isotherm relationship: 
 
  1          nKCx
m= .   
 
The values of K and 1/ n were obtained for one carbon type at 77°F.  These values must be ob-
tained for each type of carbon being evaluated and for each temperature (see Table B-2).

This calculation is only an estimate of the quantity of carbon required.  Manufacturers recom-mend calculating the carbon needed for the three or four most prevalent constituents and then adding a safety factor.  Safety factors may be as little as 20% more carbon than calculated for non-regenerable systems to as high as 100% for a very conservative design.  Applying a conser-vative safety factor of 100%. we see that the estimated carbon total ( M) becomes:

(2)  Determine the Size of the Carbon Adsorption Vessels.  
 
(a)  Estimate the Diameter of the Carbon Vessel .  The designer often has the option, 
within limits, of using a large diameter vessel that is short, or a smaller diameter vessel that is tall.  Both will hold the same amount of carbon.  A third option is to use two vessels in parallel.  As a starting point, calculate the diameter for a reasonable superficial velocity.  Superficial ve-locity ( V) is the velocity that the vapor would attain through the carbon bed if this vessel were 
empty ( V = Q/A, where Q is the vapor flow rate and A is the cross-sectional area of the vessel).  
Many carbons can be used over a large range of superficial velocities.  Manufacturers’ literature lists superficial velocities from 5 ft/min to several hundred.  Typical superficial velocities are 10 to 100 ft/min.  As superficial velocities increase, the pressure drop through the vessel increases.  This results in increased energy costs.  For this example, initially assume a superficial air veloc-ity through the carbon vessels of 50 ft/min.  Calculate the resulting diameter of the vessel as fol-lows:

The carbon vessel is too deep.  By decreasing the superficial velocity through the carbon bed from 50 to 25 ft/min and repeating the calculations done in Paragraphs B-2 c(2)(a) and B-2 c(2)(b) 
above, the diameter of the vessel becomes 10 ft and the carbon depth ( H) becomes 11 ft.  These 
are acceptable (an alternative is to use four vessels, 2 × 2).  Vessels available from manufacturers 
will dictate their exact height and diameter. 
 
(3)  Determine the Total Pressure Drops through the Units in the Process Train .  The ac-
tual pressure drops must be calculated for each application.  They will most likely differ much from those chosen here to illustrate the calculation procedure.

(e)  Carbon Vessels .  The pressure drop through the carbon bed is a function of the type 
of carbon, the velocity of the vapor through the carbon bed, and the depth of the carbon bed.  For one specific carbon in manufacturers’ literature, the pressure drop through the carbon is 0.8 in. of H
2O per foot of carbon bed.  For the 11-ft bed of carbon in this example, the pressure drop is 9 
in. of H 2O for the lead vessels and 9 in. of H 2O for the lag vessel, for a total of 18 in. of H 2O (see 
Figure B-1).

(4)  Determine the Size and Type of Blower . 
 
(a)  Size of Blower .  Design the blower to handle 2000 cfm for the above total system 
pressure drop.  The exit pressure from the blower is the pressure leaving the carbon units (12.7 psia) plus the pressure drop through the treatment train.  The blower exit pressure is as follows:

Blower performance curves must be obtained from the manufacturer.  In the absence of this in-formation, the design engineer can estimate the adiabatic (theoretical) horse power from thermo-dynamic relationships as follows. (See an engineering thermodynamics book for an additional discussion and development of these relationships.)

Prior to obtaining manufacturers data, a very rough estimate of the electrical motor size can be 
obtained by multiplying the adiabatic blower horse power ( HP) by 40%.  Using this number, we 
calculate the estimated size of the electric motor horse power is as follows:

This value should not be used for final design; it should only be used if an initial estimate is needed.  Manufacturer’s data must be used for final design calculations.

 vapor stream entering the carbon vessels should not exceed 40 to 70% (see Paragraph 3-1b).  A 
heat exchanger is used to raise the temperature (lower the RH) or lower the temperature (raise the RH) as needed.  High RH reduces the adsorption capacity of the carbon.  High temperature reduces the capacity of the carbon.  A good compromise between temperature and humidity is to raise or lower the RH to about 50%.  The type of heat exchanger depends on the amount of heating or cooling needed.  Assume that in the air stripper the vapor stream is cooled to 60°F (the temperature of the water in the air stripper).  Assume the vapor leaving the air stripper is satu-rated with moisture (100% relative humidity).  A psychrometric chart tells us that the tempera-ture must be raised in a heat exchanger from 60 to 80°F to lower the relative humidity to 50%. 
• The Fruendlich isothermal data listed in section 1a is for 77 °F.  In this example, this is 
close to the 80°F vapor temperature of the vapor entering the carbon units.  If the tem-perature difference is large, the weight of contaminant adsorbed per weight of carbon (x/m) must be determined for the new temperature and all subsequent calculations re-
peated. 
• In addition to increasing the pressure, the blower also raises the temperature of a vapor 
stream.  If the vapor goes directly from the blower to the carbon units, the temperature 
may need to be reduced, not raised, in a heat exchanger.  It is difficult to estimate the temperature rise.  The temperature rise must be obtained from manufacturers’ blower lit-erature.

GENERATION OF ISOTHERMS 
 
 
C-1.  General .  Generation of an isotherm from laboratory data is straightforward.  The iso-
therm is plotted in log-log form to ensure that it approaches a straight line, making it easier to 
read and interpret, and to apply the Freundlich equation.  After the data are plotted on a log-log scale, we can define the equation of the line by taking the log of each side of the Freundlich equation. This allows you to determine the values of K and 1/ n.  The logarithmic version of the 
Freundlich equation is a straight line in the form of y = mx + b, where b is the y-intercept for x = 
0.  In our case K equals the x/m intercept when the log of the concentration C (adsorbate re-
maining) equals one unit, the log of which is zero.  The value of m, the slope of the line, is equal 
to 1/n, which can be solved by rearranging the equation to: 
 
1(log log ) / (log )     xKCnm=−  
 
There are two ways you can generate the isotherms:  
• From laboratory data. 
 
• From existing data (see Figure 2-2). 
 
a.  Isotherm Generation from Existing Data .  Given TCE as the contaminant,  
 
K = 1060 µg/g, 
n1 = 0.500.
