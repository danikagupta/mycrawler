Abstract
A new 
isolated nonligninolytic fungus, strain Myrothecium sp. IMER1, was found to decolorize five different
synthetic dyes when grown on dye-containing agar plates. The capability of Myrothecium sp. IMER1 for
decolorization of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) and dye effluents was compared with that of five white-rot fungi.
More than 65% RBBR removal by Myrothecium sp. IMER1was observed at various pHs (5-10). About 60-95% of
decolorization was observed with these white-rot fungi in the acidic pH range of 5.0-6.0, whereas color removal rate
was less than 30% in the basic pH range of 8.0-10.0. Myrothecium sp. IMER1 had a more efficient decolorization of
the dye in a broad pH range than white-rot fungi tested. In comparison with color removal performance, Myrothecium
sp. IMER1 was approximately 2-5-fold better than white-rot fungi tested in the basic pH range. Additionally, the
visual observation and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-VIS) spectral analysis demonstrated that decolorization of dye by
Myrothecium sp. IMER1 was due to biodegradation and biosorption. Biomass production was not affected by
changes in the pH range of 7-10, indicated that Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 is alkali-tolerant fungus. Decolorization of
dye effluents by Myrothecium sp. IMER1 at pH 7 and 9 was 73 and 70%, respectively, while less than 25% of
decolorization was observed in the case of white-rot fungi tested. Our results showed that Myrothecium  sp. IMER1
exhibited efficient decolorization of dye effluents compared to white-rot fungi, indicating that the alkali-tolerant strain
Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 will be potential candidates for wastewater treatment of dye effluents, especially alkaline
dye effluents.

Introduction
Worldwide, over 10,000 different dyes and pigments are used in
textile, cosmetic, printing, drug, and food-processing industries [1].
Most of synthetic textile dyes are mutagenic and/or carcinogenic and
belong to the most dangerous pollutants [2-4]. Although conventional
chemical and physical techniques such as precipitation, adsorption,
and ozonation have been employed for the decolorization of dye
effluents, they possess inherent limitations such as high cost,
formation of hazardous by-products, and intensive energy
requirements [4-6]. As a feasible alternative, dye decolorization using
microorganisms has recently received much attention owing to their
cost effectiveness [7-11]. Currently, a lot of studies have focused on
white rot fungi that seem to be more prospective organisms [12].
These fungi are efficient ligninolytic organisms capable of degrading
many xenobiotic compounds including various types of dye such as
azo, anthraquinone, reactive, and triphenylmethane dyes [13-17].
Due to the complexity of the biodegradation mechanism of
ligninolytic system, requirements for some redox mediators and low
pH for the optimum activity of the enzymes will be present in a
wastewater, which are major disadvantages of bioremediation by white
rot fungi [14,18]. On the other hand, studies of nonligninolytic fungi
degrading dyes are few [19]. Such studies are very interesting not only
from the standpoint of comparative biology but also with the
expectation of finding better fungi for use in the treatment of dyeeffluents. Our previous studies showed that the nonligninolytic
fungus, Myrothecium  sp. IMER1, can decolorize dyes and dye
effluents. Furthermore, unlike white rot fungi, this strain can grow at
high pH [20-22].
However, decolorization efficiency of dye/dye effluents by
Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 and white-rot fungi were not systematically
compared. Therefore, the major objective of this study is to investigate
efficiencies of different white rot fungi strains and Myrothecium  sp.
IMER1 for decolorization of the dye (RBBR) and dye effluents at
various pHs. The results would help to evaluate decolorizing
performance of these strains tested and select the right strains for an
effective decolorization process.
Materials and Methods
Materials
2, 2’-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was

Prior to laboratory decolorization treatment, the effluent was
centrifuged at 10,000×g for 15 min to remove large suspended
particles and then was sterilized. Sample absorbances were measured
using a Varian CARY50 UV-Vis (St. California, USA)
spectrophotometer; pH values were measured with a pHS-3A pH-
meter (Hangzhou Wanda Instrument Factory, China).
Organism and culture conditions
Fungal strains used in this study were: SDK ( Polyporus  sp. SDK),
AX3 ( Leutinus  sp. AX3), DS1 ( Schizophyllum  sp. DS1), CD3 ( Irpex  sp.
CD3), BP2 ( Pleurotus  sp. BP2), IMER1 ( Myrothecium  sp. IMER1).
The strain Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 was isolated from soil from the
suburb of Wuhan, P.R.China. On the basis of the comparison of
sequences of the ITS regions and 5.8SrRNA gene with those found in
databanks, its morphology, and microscopy observations, it was
identified as Myrothecium  sp. (GenBank accession no. EF458487).
These strains were isolated and identified in our laboratory. They were
grown in potato dextrose broth medium (PDB), or on potato dextrose
agar medium (PDA). Every strain was maintained on PDA medium
slant. The slant was inoculated and incubated at 28°C for 5-6 days, and
then stored at 4°C and periodically sub-cultured.
Dye decolorization on solid plates
Dye agar plates were prepared using PDA containing 60mg L-1 of
each individual dye. Plates were inoculated with a 1 cm2 piece of the
fungus isolated from a six day PDA plate growth, cut out from the
actively growing fungal culture. Dye agar plates that were not
inoculated served as controls. All plates were incubated at 28°C. After
six days, the size of the decolorization halo was measured.
Decolorization experiments in PDB and determination of
biomass production
For the decolorization experiments, five agar plugs (6 mm
diameter) of active mycelium from PDA plate was transferred
aseptically into 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of
autoclaved PDB medium and RBBR (60mg L-1) or the dye effluent at
different concentration of 30% (v/v). The pH of PDB medium was
adjusted using 1.0 M NaOH or 1.0 M HCl. The cultures were
incubated at 28°C in rotary shakers running at 150 rpm. Biotic
(sterilized medium, without dye addition) and abiotic (sterilized
medium containing the effluent but not inoculated with the fungus)
control experimental sets were also prepared and maintained in
parallel with the decolorization experiments. The cultivations were
carried out in triplicate. Culture samples were withdrawn at defined
intervals, and after centrifugation at 10,000×g for 20 min at 10°C, the
supernatants were used as samples for decolorization assay. Biomass
production was evaluated by determining the dry mass of mycelia.
Mycelia were harvested from the cultivation liquid by filtration using a
piece of filter paper, dried at 105°C for 24 h and weighed.
Enzyme assays
Bilirubin Oxidase (BOX) or laccase activity was quantified using an
assay based on the oxidation of ABTS. The assay reaction mixture
consisted of 1.5 mM ABTS, sodium acetate buffer (0.2 M, pH 4.0) and
a suitable amount of enzyme to create a total reaction volume of 3.0 ml
that was incubated at 25°C. The unit activity was expressed as 1 μM of
product formed per min under the assay conditions [23,24].Decolorization analysis
Decolorization of RBBR was analyzed in culture filtrates and
monitored spectrophotometrically at the maximum wavelength of
absorbance (595 nm). The intensity of effluent color was measured at
its maximum absorbance wavelength 510 nm. Color removal rate (P)
was calculated according to the following formula: P=(A 1-A2)/
A1×100%. Where A 1 represented the absorbance of the control, A 2
represented the absorbance of the corresponding untreated sample,
and P was the dye/effluent color removal rate.
Statistical analysis
All decolorization experiments were performed in three sets. The
results reported are an average of the three data points with standard
deviations calculated. The data from phytotoxicity studies were
analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using a Tukey-
Kramer multiple comparison test.
Results and discussion
Decolorization of textile dyes by Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 on
PDA plates
The selected dyes (Indigo Carmine, RBBR, Congo red, Malachite
green and Bromophenol Blue) have never been tested before with
Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 on solid medium (Figure S1). First, Indigo
Carmine was completely decolorized, as revealed by the >78 mm
diameter of the decolorized zone after six days. Decolorization of
RBBR was less extensive with a decolorized zone diameter of between
63 to 70 mm. Second, partial decolorization was obtained for Congo
red and Malachite green. Finally, little decolorization was observed for
Bromophenol Blue. Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 showed different
potentials to decolorize five different dyes which belong to four
classifications. The class of the dye which defines its structure is
influential in deciding the extent to which dye is decolorized. Wong
and Yu observed that anthraquinone dye was Trametes  versicolor
laccase substrate while azo and indigo dyes were not the substrates of
laccase [25].
Thus it is seen that that dye decolorization by fungus was
dependent on dye structures. Spadaro et al reported that aromatic
rings with substituents such as hydroxyl, amino, acetamido, or nitro
functions were mineralized to a greater extent than unsubstituted rings
in dye decolorization by Phanerochaete  chrysosporium  [26]. Knapp et
al reported that relatively small structural differences could markedly
affect decolorization and this might be due to electron distribution and
charge density as well as steric factors [27].
Comparison of Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 and five white-rot
fungi for decolorization of RBBR at various pHs
RBBR is a typical anthraquinone dye used in the textile industry,
represents an important class of toxic and recalcitrant
organopollutants [28]. It was reported that the dye can be decolorized
by many white-rot fungi and Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 [20,28].
Therefore we compared decolorization capability of Myrothecium  sp.
IMER1 for Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) with five different white-
rot fungi over a pH range of 5.0 to 10.0. The decolorization rate of
RBBR was measured in culture filtrates after 6 d of incubation. As
shown in Figure 1a, more than 65% of decolorization was observed
with these white-rot fungi in the acidic pH range of 5.0-6.0, whereasCitation: Huang J, Fu Y, Liu Y (2014) Comparison of Alkali-Tolerant Fungus Myrothecium  Sp. IMER1 and White-Rot Fungi for Decolorization of

By contrast, 60-70% color removal was obtained with Myrothecium
sp. IMER1 in the acidic pH range of 5.0-6.0, and more than 65% of
decolorization was observed in the basic pH range of 8.0-10.0. These
results showed that Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 exhibited excellent
decolorizing performance at all the pH value tested (5.0 to 10.0).
Kapdan et al. reported the optimum growth pH of Coriolus  versicolor
as 4.5 [29]. Decolourization of Solar golden yellow R by Schizophyllum
commune  indicated that maximum decolourization efficiency (73%)
was observed at pH 4.5 after 6 days [30]. It has been widely reported
that for majority of the fungi the optimum pH for dye decolorization is
in the acidic range. Unfortunately, such a low pH is not suitable for the
wastewater treatment. Therefore, fungal strain showed an appreciable
decolorization of dye over a wide range of pH, which is desirable for
industrial applications since it can be used for wastewater treatment
without a previous pH adjustment stage [31].

studies of the selected dyes during solid plate growth of
Myrothecium sp. IMER1
Decolorization of dyes by most fungi could be due to adsorption to
microbial cells or to biodegradation [32,33]. If the dye removal were
attributed to biodegradation, either the major UV-VIS light
absorbance peak would completely disappear or a new peak would
appear. In adsorption, cells of fungus become deeply colored because
of adsorbing dyes [34,35]. The absorbance spectra of the dye were
scanned before and after decolorization and changes in its absorption
spectrum (350-800 nm) were recorded. The absorption peaks of RBBR
in the visible region disappeared, suggesting that removal of dye by
Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 should be partly attributed to biodegradation
(Figure 1b). In addition, in the decolorization of RBBR by
Myrothecium  sp. IMER1, the cells were stained deeply colored at pHs
(5.0-10.0), indicating that the dye was adsorbed on the cell surface,
which was partly due to biosorption [Figure 1c]. It suggested that
decolorization by Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 involved biosorption and
biodegradation. This result was in agreement with our previous studies
[20,21].

To investigate the effect of pH on growth of Myrothecium  sp.
IMER1, biomass production was evaluated by determining the dry
mass of mycelia. No decrease or increase in biomass production was
observed throughout the study in the pH range of 5.0-8.0 (Figure 2a).
Interestingly, cells of Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 grew almost as well as
the control at pH 9.0 and 10.0 (Figure 2b). Although biomass
production of Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 decreased slightly with
increase pH value (9.0-10.0), data statistically analyzed showed that
there were no significantly difference in biomass production between
control group and experimental group. In comparison with
Myrothecium  sp. IMER1, growth of white-rot fungi tested such as
Pleurotus  sp. BP2 was strongly inhibited and low biomass production
was observed in the basic pH range of 9.0-10.0 (Figure 2c). The results
indicated that biomass production of Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 might
not be affected by changes in the pH range of 7-10, which also
confirmed that Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 is alkali-tolerant fungus.
Previously, Sulistyaningdyah et al. had reported that Myrothecium
verrucaria  24G-4 is an alkali-tolerant fungus and can grow at pH10.0
[36].

fungi for decolorization of dye effluents
Although a large number of lab-scale studies have been conducted
on decolorization of single synthetic dye solutions and simulated dye
wastewaters by fungal biosorption/biodegradation, there is a need to
generate relative performance data on real dye effluents [37,38].
Decolorization of industrial effluent from dyeing industry is shown in
Figure 3. At pH 7.0 and 9.0, decolorization by Myrothecium  sp.
IMER1 at the effluent concentrations of 30% (v/v) was 73 and 70%,
respectively, whereas in the case of white-rot fungi tested less than 25%
of decolorization was observed. The result showed that Myrothecium
sp. IMER1 had higher color removal efficiency than these white-rot
fungi tested under neutral and alkaline conditions. On the one hand,
when UV-VIS spectra of dye effluent-containing culture fluid for
defined intervals were scanned from 350-800 nm, a marked decrease
in absorbance maximum at 510 nm was observed at 6-days incubation,
which was related to the breakdown of the chromophoric group in
dyes of the effluent (Figure 3b and 3c ). On the other hand, the mycelia
became deeply colored at the beginning of decolorization, and then
became faint, finally almost disappeared (Figure 3d). Spectra analyses
of culture supernatants and color changes in fungal cells suggested that
dyes in the effluent were removed by Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 mainly
due to enzymatic reaction.
It was reported that most white-rot fungi only exhibit good
decolorization ability in the acidic pH range of 3-6, which due to low
pH for the optimum activity of extracellular ligninolytic enzymes
[39,40]. The decolorization capability of Myrothecium  sp.IMER1
under alkaline conditions will be an advantage in the case of practical
applications to dye effluents, because pulping, bleaching and dye-
producing are mainly performed under highly alkaline conditions and
their effluents generated are also alkaline.

It has previously been reported that BOX as a main extracellular
oxidoreductase of Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 plays a major role in the
dye decolorization, while in the case of many white-rot fungi; maindecolorization enzyme is laccase [20-22]. Therefore, BOX/laccase
activity and the biomass production of Myrothecium  sp. IMER1/
white-rot fungi tested were evaluated during decolorization. Both
enzyme activity and biomass production of Myrothecium  sp. IMER1
were higher than that of all white-rot fungi tested, which attributed to
the fact that Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 is alkali-tolerant fungus and
BOX activity keeps good under neutral and alkaline pHs (Figure 4).
Conclusions
The non-ligninolytic fungus Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 was capable
of decolorizing five different synthetic dyes. Congo red, Malachite
green and Bromophenol Blue were decolorized to some extent with
varying percentages of decolorization, whereas, to Indigo Carmine,
RBBR were more easily decolorized. Decolorization efficiencies of
RBBR and dye effluents with Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 were compared
to five white-rot fungi. Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 exhibited better
decolorizing performance than white-rot fungi tested at the pH value
tested (7 to 10). Biomass production of Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 was
not affected by changes in the pH range of 7-10, which confirmed that
Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 is alkali-tolerant fungus. Moreover,
Myrothecium  sp. IMER1 had higher color removal efficiency of dye
effluents than these white-rot fungi tested under neutral and alkaline
conditions. The alkali-tolerant fungal strain Myrothecium  sp. IMER1
exhibited high decolorization activity in the basic pH range, which
would be suitable for the treatment of dye effluents with alkaline pH
but also for other industrial applications, such as bio-bleaching.
