Abstract
Azoreductases reduce the azo bond (N=N) in azo dyes 
to produce colorless amine products. Crude cell extracts 
from Enterococcus faecalis  have been shown to utilize 
both NADH and NADPH as electron donors for azo dye 
reduction. An azoreductase was purified from E. faecalis  by 
hydrophobic, anion exchange and affinity chromatography. 
The azoreductase activity of the purified preparation was 
tested on a polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis under 
native conditions and the protein that decolorized the 
azo dye (Methyl Red) with both NADH and NADPH was 
identified by mass spectrometry to be AzoA. Previously, the 
heterologously expressed and purified AzoA was shown to 
utilize NADH only for the reduction of Methyl Red. However, 
AzoA purified from the wild-type organism was shown 
to utilize both coenzymes but with more than 180-fold 
preference for NADH over NADPH as an electron donor to 
reduce Methyl Red. Also, its specific activity was more than 
150-fold higher than the previous study on AzoA when NADH 
was used as the electron donor.  The catalytic efficiency for 
Methyl Red reduction by AzoA from E. faecalis  was several 
orders of magnitude higher than other azoreductases that 
were purified from a heterologous source.
Introduction
Azoreductases are enzymes that reduce the azo bond 
(N=N) in azo dyes to produce colorless amine products 
(Stolz, 2001). These dyes are widely used in the paper, 
textile, food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries and 
are regarded as environmental pollutants and a danger to 
human health due to their role in carcinogenesis (Chen, 
2006; Chung et al., 1992; Stolz, 2001). 
Although azo dyes are anthropogenic, azo dye reduction 
is observed in many organisms by enzymes which include 
the rat liver enzyme, cytochrome P450 (Zbaida and Levine, 
1990), rabbit liver aldehyde oxidase (Stoddart and Levine, 
1992) and azoreductases from the intestinal microbiota, 
environmental bacteria and fungi (Chen, 2006) as well as 
halotolerant and halophilic organisms (Asad et al., 2007).
 
Bacterial azoreductases from different organisms are 
diverse and variations can exist among the same organism 
(Ghosh et al., 1992). Classification of azoreductases 
based on their primary amino acid level is difficult due to low homology. However, a classification scheme based on 
the secondary and tertiary amino acid analysis has been 
developed (Abraham KJ, 2007). Based on function, another 
classification scheme is used in which  azoreductases 
are categorized as either flavin-dependant azoreductases 
(Chen et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2004; Nakanishi et al., 
2001) or flavin-independent azoreductases (Blumel et 
al., 2002; Blumel and Stolz, 2003). The flavin-dependent 
azoreductases are further organized into three groups; 
NADH only (Chen et al., 2004; Nakanishi et al., 2001), 
NADPH only (Chen et al., 2005) or both (Ghosh et al., 1992; 
Wang et al., 2007), as these coenzymes serve as electron 
donors. 
Enterococcus faecalis  is a Gram-positive opportunistic 
pathogen present in the intestine of mammals. The 
heterologously expressed and purified azoreductase, AzoA 
has been characterized (Chen et al., 2004) and crystallized 
(Liu et al., 2007). According to Chen et al. , AzoA is an FMN-
dependent azoreductase that can use only NADH as an 
electron donor. However, our studies (Punj and John, 2008) 
on crude cell extracts from wild-type as well as previous 
studies (Walker et al., 1971) have shown that azoreductase 
activity involves NADPH as well as an electron donor. This 
observed activity could be due to the presence of other 
NADPH-specific azoreductases or altered activity caused 
by the heterologously expressed enzyme.  
The current study focuses on the purification and mass 
spectrometry-based identification of a native azoreductase 
(AzoA) from E. faecalis.  It is the first study to show a 
qualitative polyacrylamide-based enzyme assay under 
aerobic conditions for an azoreductase isolated from a 
human intestinal bacterium.  The pseudo first order kinetic 
rates of AzoA using NADH, NADPH, FMN and Methyl Red 
as substrates are described and the catalytic efficiency of the 
wild-type purified AzoA is compared to other azoreductases 
purified from a heterologous source. 
Materials and Methods
E. faecalis  ATCC 27274 was grown in Brain Heart Infusion 
(BHI) medium (Difco Laboratories, Spark, MD, USA). For 
long term storage, 16% glycerol stocks of the organism 
were prepared and stored at -80 °C.  Methyl Red (MCB 
Chemicals, Norwood, Ohio, USA; molecular weight, 269.31, 
2[4-(CH 3)2NC6H4N:N]C 6H4CO 2H, CAS registry 63451-28-5) 
was used as the azo dye under investigation. NAD(P)
H (> 99% purity) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, 
USA) and FMN was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Purification of azoreductase 
Preparation of cell extracts: A single colony of  E. faecalis  
grown on a BHI plate was used to inoculate 5 mL of BHI 
broth. The culture was grown at 37 °C for 12 h and 1 mL 
was transferred to 20 L of BHI broth. The 20 L culture was 
incubated at 37°C until an OD 600 = 0.9 (late log phase) was 
reached. The cells were harvested at 6000 x g for 10 min at 
4 °C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 
mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7).
Lysozyme and DNase I were added at final concentrations 
of 1 mg.mL-1 and 10 μg.mL-1  respectively, and the sample 
was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The sample was 
sonicated (probe diameter = 2 cm) on ice at 60% output 
using a Sonic 300 Dismembrator (Artek systems corporation, 
farmindale, NY, USA) for a total of 6 min with 20 s pulses 
and phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride (PMSF, 1 mM final 
concentration) was immediately added. The lysate was 
clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C 
and the pellet was discarded. Ammonium sulfate was added 
at 4 °C to the clarified cell extract to a final concentration of 
0.5 M and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 0.5 
mM. Note: All subsequent purifications steps were carried 
out at 4°C. 
Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC): The 
sample was applied at a linear flow rate of 8.5 cm.h-1  to 
an octyl sepharose 4 flast flow column (2.5 x 15.5 cm) that 
was equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM potassium phosphate 
buffer, pH 7; 0.5 mM EDTA; 0.5 M ammonium sulfate). After 
applying the sample, the column was washed with two 
volumes of 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 and 
the bound protein was eluted with 30% isopropanol. The 
eluted protein was concentrated to 20 mL and diafiltrated 
with 200 mL of buffer C (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, the pH of 
Tris-Cl was adjusted at 4 °C with HCl) in an ultrafiltration 
cell (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) using a 10,000 NMWL 
membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA).
Ion Exchange Chromatography (IEX): The sample was 
diluted with buffer C to obtain a final protein concentration 
of  7.5 mg.mL-1 and applied at a linear flow rate of 7 cm.h-1  
to a DEAE Bio-gel agarose column (2.5 x 10.5 cm) which 
was previously equilibrated with buffer C. The column was 
washed with 300 mL of buffer C. The protein was eluted 
with 300 mL of buffer C containing a linear gradient of 
NaCl from 0-200 mM. The fractions (6 mL each) that had 
the highest azoreductase activity were pooled together and 
concentrated to 11 mL. 
Affinity Chromatography: The pooled and concentrated 
sample was applied at a linear flow rate of 9 cm.h-1  to Affi-
gel Blue gel (2 x 1.5 cm) that was equilibrated with buffer C. 
The column was washed with 12 mL of buffer C containing 
1 M NaCl. The bound protein was eluted with 12 mL of 
30% isopropanol containing 3 M NaCl. The sample was 
concentrated and diafiltrated with 100 mL of buffer A. The 
enzyme fraction was aliquoted and stored at – 20 °C in 50% 
glycerol.Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford 
method with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.  
Azoreductase activity assay 
Qualitative assay:  A preparative mini 5-12.5% gradient 
resolving polyacrylamide gel was prepared according 
to the method by Laemmli (Laemmli, 1970), without the 
addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) using a Mini-
PROTEAN® II apparatus (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA, USA).  
The protein sample from the affinity chromatography 
fraction (0.3 mg.mL-1) was loaded in the single preparative 
reference well.  Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C in 
Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.3 at 6 milliamps constant current. 
After electrophoresis, the gel was split down the middle and 
each half was placed in two shallow trays. To one tray, 5 mL 
buffer DH (Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; 0.5 mM Methyl Red; 10 μM FMN; 
1 mM NADH) was added and to the other tray, 5mL buffer 
DPH (Tris-Cl, pH 7.5; 0.5 mM Methyl Red; 10 μM FMN; 2 
mM NADPH) was added. Each tray was incubated for 10 
min at room temperature with gentle shaking to assure 
that solutions were evenly distributed across the gels. After 
the zones of clearing were observed, the center and the 
periphery of the clear zone on both gels were marked by 
a notch and the mobility of the clearing zone calculated. 
The gels were subsequently directly stained by Coomassie 
Blue R-250 and using the notch as the reference point, 
the mobility of the visible protein band was determined. 
Mobility was calculated as the ratio of the distance of center 
of clearing zone (protein) to the distance traveled by the 
tracking dye.
Quantitative assay during purification: The assay was 
carried out in 1 mL cuvettes and contained 50 mM phosphate 
buffer, (pH 7.2); 20 μM Methyl Red; 20 μM FMN; 0.5 mM 
NADPH and an appropriate amount of enzyme (1-800 μg). 
The reaction was initiated by adding NADPH. The enzyme 
activity was determined by an absorbance reduction in the 
first 2 min at 430 nm for Methyl Red using a UV-Visible 
spectrophotometer (UV-1601PC, Shimadzu, Columbia, 
MD, USA). The extinction coefficient for Methyl Red used 
was 23,360  M-1 cm-1. A unit (U) of azoreductase activity 
was defined as the amount of enzyme required to reduce 1 
μmol per min of Methyl Red. 
Protein Identification
Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight 
(MALDI-TOF): The protein band corresponding to the zone 
of clearing seen in Fig. 1B was excised and washed with 
50% acetonitrile/25mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0). 
The sample was dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile and 
subsequently digested with a solution of 
15 µg.ml-1 sequencing-grade trypsin in 25 mM bicarbonate 
buffer. The peptides were extracted with 0.5% trifluoroacetic 
acid (TFA) mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid  and 
analyzed in reflectron mode using a Voyager-DE™ PRO 
Biospectrometry Workstation (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., 
USA). Spectra were deisotoped using a detection threshold 
that was manually adjusted to exclude spectral noise, and 
the result peak list was used to search the MSDB database 
(3239079 sequences) using the Mascot search engine 
(Matrix Science, London, UK). Search parameters included 
a statement of 100 ppm mass accuracy and the amino acid FMN-dependent NAD(P)H Azoreductase from Enterococcus faecalis    61
modifications: Met oxidation, pyroglutamate cyclization of 
glutamine, and acrylamide adducts of Cysteine. 
Capillary HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectra (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS): The HPLC-ESI-MS/MS data 
for the trypsin digested sample were acquired on a Thermo 
Fisher LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer fitted with a 
New Objective PicoView 550 nanospray interface. On-line 
HPLC separation of the digests was accomplished with an 
Eksigent NanoLC micro HPLC:  column, PicoFrit™ (New 
Objective, Woburn, MA, USA; 75 μm i.d.) packed to 10 
cm with C18 adsorbent (Vydac, Grace, Deerfield, IL, USA; 
218MS 5 μm, 300 Å); mobile phase A, 0.5% acetic acid 
(HAc)/0.005% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); mobile phase B, 
90% acetonitrile/0.5% HAc/0.005% TFA; gradient 2 to 42% 
B in 30 min; flow rate, 0.4 μl.min-1. MS conditions were: 
ESI voltage, 2.9 kV; isolation window for MS/MS, 3; relative 
collision energy, 35%; scan strategy, survey scan followed by 
acquisition of data dependent collision-induced dissociation 
(CID) spectra of the seven most intense ions in the survey 
scan above a set threshold.  The uninterpreted CID spectra 
were searched against the NCBInr database [20080310 
(6298708 sequences; 2152697077 residues)] by means of 
Mascot (Matrix Science).  Variable modifications considered 
for the searches included:  oxidation of His, Met, and Trp; Trp 
conversion to kynurenin.  Determination of protein identity 
probabilities were accomplished by Scaffold™ (Proteome 
Software, Portland, Oregon, USA). Scaffold verifies peptide 
identifications assigned by SEQUEST and Mascot using the 
X!Tandem database searching program (Craig and Beavis, 
2003).   Scaffold then probabilistically validates these 
peptide identifications using PeptideProphet (Keller et al., 
2002) and derives corresponding protein probabilities using 
ProteinProphet (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003). Pseudo first order kinetics
To determine the apparent pseudo kinetic parameters, the 
concentration of one substrate was varied and the other 
substrates’ remained constant. The constant concentration 
for Methyl Red was 20 μM and the varying concentrations 
were 2 - 20 μM. For NADH, the constant was 1 mM and 
varying concentrations were 10 - 80 μM. For FMN, constant 
concentration was 20 μM and varying concentrations were 
0.5 - 5 μM. For NADPH the varying concentrations were 1.5 
- 10 mM. The parameters were determined from the double 
reciprocal plot using the KaleidaGraph software (Synergy 
software).
 
Results
Enzyme purification
Methyl Red, NADPH and FMN were used for the 
azoreductase assays during all the purification steps. The 
initial specific azoreductase activity in the crude cytoplasmic 
extracts was 0.003 U.mg-1.  A combination of hydrophobic 
interaction, ion-exchange and affinity chromatography was 
used to purify over 200 – fold of the native azoreductase 
with a recovery of 10% (Table I). The protein concentration 
throughout the purification was determined by the Bradford 
method.
Native PAGE assay for azoreductase
The affinity chromatography purified fraction was subjected 
to electrophoresis at 4 °C on a discontinuous native PAGE 
gel (5-12.5% gradient). The gel was divided in half and each 
half was incubated separately at room temp with 1mM NADH 
and 2mM NADPH to determine which reduced pyridine 
nucleotide could be utilized as an electron donor. A clearing 
zone, indicating Methyl Red reduction, was observed in 
both gels (Fig. 1 A).  The mobility of the clear zones and the 
Coomassie Blue stained bands on both gels were the same 
which suggests the same enzyme could utilize NAD(P)H as 
the electron donors to reduce Methyl Red (Fig. 1 A and B).

Identification of the azoreductase
The protein band corresponding to the zone of clearing on the 
native PAGE assay (Fig. 1B) was analyzed by trypsonolysis, 
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and database searching.   
Using this approach, the predominant protein in the band 
was identified as a putative acyl carrier protein from E.  
faecalis  V583 (AAO82310 from NCBI), yielding a Mascot 
score of 116 versus the statistical significance threshold 
of 78 (p<0.05). An analysis of this hypothetical protein 
sequence revealed that it was the same azoreductase 
(AzoA) identified previously by Chen et al.  (Chen et al., 
2004). All other candidate identifications had scores less 
than 78, and were therefore regarded as statistically 
insignificant. The identification of the azoreductase was 
based on matching 9 of 16 experimental ion masses which 
were assigned from the most intense peaks, representing 
49% of the azoreductase sequence (Fig. 2). 
To ensure that there were no other proteins in the sample 
that may have contributed to the azoreductase activity; the 
trypsin-digested sample was subjected to a more sensitive 
analysis using nano-bore High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography in conjunction with Electrospray Tandem 
Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). 
Tandem mass spectrometry and database searching 
again identified the putative acyl carrier protein from E. 
faecalis  V583 (AAO82310 from NCBI) with search metrics 
supporting this identification to 100% probability for the 
protein and 95% probability for each peptide (17 unique spectra representing 11 unique peptides which covered 56% 
of AzoA sequence) (Fig. 2).  LC-MS/MS and a database 
search at 99.9% minimum protein and 95% minimum 
peptide statistical thresholds identified 16 proteins based 
on a minimum of 2 peptides, including low levels of keratin 
contamination. The spectral count indicated that AzoA was 
the most abundant protein in the sample i.e., 48 AzoA-
derived spectra in contrast to 22 spectra from hypoxanthine-
guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and 12 spectra from 
human keratin which were the next most abundant proteins. 
No other oxidoreductases were detected in the band of 
clearing, even when the stringency for identification was 
relaxed to include proteins associated with or identified by 
only one peptide, a minimum protein identification threshold 
of 95% and a minimum peptide identification threshold of 
90%.  
Pseudo first order kinetics
In order to reduce Methyl Red, the enzyme required FMN 
and NAD(P)H. Table II indicates the apparent kinetic 
parameters for the substrates which were determined from 
the double reciprocal plot. The Vmax values for all substrates 
were similar, but the catalytic efficiency of AzoA to utilize 
NADH over NADPH during Methyl Red reduction was more 
than 180 – fold (data not shown). The apparent Km values of 
11 μM and 82 μM for Methyl Red and NADH respectively in 
this study were lower than 24 μM and 140 μM respectively 
as described in the previous study (Chen et al., 2004). FMN 
had the lowest apparent Km value of 3 μM and NADPH had 
the highest apparent  Km of 15 mM.  No azoreductase activity

  The results are means of three independent experiments  (± standard deviation)  
 FMN-dependent NAD(P)H Azoreductase from Enterococcus faecalis    63
was observed when the sulfonated azo dyes, Direct Blue 15 
and Tartrazine, were used as substrate. Methyl Red was 
not reduced in the control reaction which contained NADPH 
and the azo dye but no enzyme. An additional control 
which contained FMN, NADPH and Methyl Red showed no 
spontaneous reduction of the dye. The same results were 
observed when NADH was used in the control experiments 
instead of NADPH. These control experiments confirm that 
the reduction of Methyl Red is associated with AzoA and not 
due to the instability of the dye under the reaction conditions 
as well as non-enzymatic reactions.
It is important to note that the aforementioned definition of 
specific activity was in molar quantity ( μmol.min -1.mg -1) 
while the specific activity as defined by the earlier study 
(Chen et al., 2004) was in molar concentration ( μM.min 
-1.mg -1). Thus, when recalculating the apparent Vmax of 
AzoA for Methyl Red (89.2 μM.min -1.mg -1) from the earlier 
study according to the current definition, the value in the 
2 mL reaction mixture would be 0.18 μmol.min -1.mg -1. 
In comparison, the apparent Vmax for Methyl Red in the 
present study was 29 (±5) μmol.min -1.mg -1 (Table II); 
hence, the value obtained from the present study was more 
than 150-fold higher than the previous estimation of Vmax 
for AzoA.  
Table III compares the kinetic parameters for azoreductase 
between the heterologous source ( E. coli) and the natural 
source ( E. faecalis) . The catalytic efficiency ( Kcat.Km-1) 
clearly indicates that the E. faecalis -purified AzoA (1.9 
μM-1. s-1) is 380-fold higher than the E. coli -purified AzoA 
(0.005 μM-1. s-1) and approximately 190 and 11-fold higher 
than the azoreductases from Staphylococcus aureus  and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  respectively.                 Discussion
The structure and function of azoreductases from 
microorganisms is not fully understood as these enzymes 
have specific and broad specificities.  In addition, the very 
low homology at the enzymes’ primary structure level makes 
it difficult to classify and assess its evolutionary progression.  
Current classification schemes use the enzymes preference 
for an electron donor, which are flavin-dependent NADH 
only, NADPH only, and both.
Previous work (Walker et al., 1971) demonstrated that E. 
faecalis  cell extracts  could utilize both NAD(P)H as electron 
donors for azoreductase activity, although activity was much 
greater for NADH compared to NADPH . Our work (Punj 
and John, 2008) also supported the activity for both NADH 
and NADPH from E. faecalis . In comparison, another study 
showed heterologously expressed AzoA from E. faecalis  
utilized only NADH for azo dye reduction.  It was reasoned 
that there may be other azoreductases present in wild-type 
E. faecalis  or altered activity in a heterologous system.  
Using a 3-step purification process, a polyacrylamide-based 
enzyme assay and mass spectrometry, we showed that 
AzoA from E. faecalis  was indeed responsible for utilizing 
both NADH and NADPH for activity. Hence, we conclude 
that AzoA is an NAD(P)H dependent enzyme and can 
thus be reclassified as an NADH and NADPH dependent 
azoreductase. The previous study on heterologously 
expressed AzoA by Chen’s group also utilized a similar 
3-step purification process; but the NADPH activity was 
not observed, possibly due to the overall low activity of 
the enzyme from the heterologous system. As shown in 
Table III, AzoA purified from its natural source reduced 
Methyl Red with much greater efficiency than other flavin-
dependent azoreductases, including AzoA purified from a 
64   Punj and John
heterologous source. These results indicate that the true 
catalytic efficiency of the azoreductases from S. aureus  
and P. aeruginosa  may be underestimated since they were 
purified and characterized from a heterologous system.      
The characterization of the native purified AzoA 
supported the association of the FMN and the NAD(P)
H binding pocket i.e., the reduction of the dye occurs by 
the transfer of electron from NAD(P)H via FMN (Chen et 
al., 2004; Nakanishi et al., 2001). It was determined that 
externally added FMN was essential for activity of AzoA, 
most likely due to the FMN moieties being disassociated 
from the holoenzyme during the hydrophobic-column 
protein purification step. Chen’s group also showed the 
disassociation of the FMN prosthetic group from the AzoA 
holoenzyme after hydrophobic chromatography. Our finding 
of FMN association is also supported by the crystal structure 
information for azoreductases possessing a flavodoxin_2 
domain (PF02525) such as AzoA, AzoR and paAzoR1 (Ito 
et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007). 
Analysis of the active sites, based on the crystal structures 
of  E. coli AzoR  (PDB code: 1V4B)  (Ito et al., 2006), P. 
aeruginosa paAzoR1  (PDB code: 2v9c) (Wang et al., 2007), 
human FAD-dependent NAD(P)H:quinine oxidoreductase 
NQO1 (PDB code: 1DXO) (Faig et al., 2000) and E. faecalis  
AzoA (PDB code: 2HPV) (Liu et al., 2007) showed that 
they are highly conserved which supports the presence 
of a NAD(P)H binding pocket. In addition, the active site 
of NQO1, reveals that the NH in the main chain of Phe232 
forms a hydrogen bond with an oxygen of the phosphate 
moiety in NADPH while this bond is not formed in the 
presence of NADH (Li et al., 1995). Finally, it has also been 
suggested that there maybe conformational flexibility in the 
active site which could lead to binding of both NADH as well 
as NADPH (Wang et al., 2007).In conclusion, the azoreductase AzoA isolated from E. 
faecalis  and tested under native gel conditions can utilize 
NAD(P)H as an electron donor but its  preference is for 
NADH. The specific activity is more than a 150-fold higher 
when NADH is used as the electron donor as compared 
to its activity when expressed heterologously in E. coli . 
Thus, the azoreductase AzoA purified from E. faecalis  will 
provide better activity analysis that is more reflective of 
xenobiotic degradation within the intestine. Although the 
E. coli- based  over-expression system is a fast and efficient 
process to characterize azoreductases, it may not reflect 
the activity of the azoreductase that is inherently present in 
its natural source. To this end, the combination of column 
chromatography and the polyacrylamide-based native gel 
assay coupled with mass spectrometry is a useful method to 
isolate and identify azoreductases from their native source.
