1 Introduction
Plastics are found everywhere in society, and problems with 
plastic residues include extensive accumulations in landfills 
and in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, which affect wildlife and human health (Lithner et al., 2011; Bugnicourt et al., 2014). These problems have encouraged researchers to study biodegradable plastic materials that could replace petrochemical polymers; polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have emerged as a promising alternative (Steinbüchel, 2010; Saharan et al., 2014; Urtuvia et al., 2014).
PHAs are a class of natural polyesters that can be 
accumulated by various microorganisms when there is an excess of available carbon and a limited supply of at least one nutrient essential to bacterial cell growth (Borges et al., 2004; Saharan et al., 2014; Urtuvia et al., 2014). Bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas , which belongs to ribosomal RNA homology 
group I, are able to synthesize PHA using a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, fructose and sucrose (Diniz et al., 2004; Santhanam & Sasidharan, 2010; Davis et al., 2013), n-octane and octanoate (Smet et al., 1983; Durner et al., 2000), and fatty acids (Du & Yu, 2002; Allen et al., 2010), among others.
P . oleovorans  shows the specific ability to synthesize medium-
chain-length PHAs (monomers with 6 to 16 carbon atoms in the main chain) from fatty acids (β-oxidation) (Fiedler et al., 2002), and sugars (de novo  biosynthesis) (Huisman et al., 1989). 
That ability has encouraged the use of different combinations of carbohydrates and lipids to produce biopolymers with particular properties and function; such combinations include the glucose/lipid mixture (Ashby et al., 2001), hydrolyzed corn oil (Shang et al., 2008), cassava wastewater (Costa et al., 2009), 
whey and starch sources (Steinbüchel, 2010), and palm oil 
(Sudesh et al., 2011).
Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) has previously been 
identified as an important carbon source for biotechnological processes (Pandey  et  al., 2000). Ramadas  et  al. (2009) and 
Aremu et al. (2010) produced PHAs from enzymatically and 
thermally hydrolyzed cassava starch. Using cassava wastewater, 
Nitschke & Pastore (2006) produced biosurfactants, and 
Costa et al. (2009) produced PHAs and rhamnolipids.
Brazil is the place of origin of cassava having a substantial 
diversity with a large collection of different varieties (Olsen, 2004). Sugary cassava, or mandiocaba , is a variety of cassava 
with a high content of free sugars, such as glucose, fructose, 
and sucrose. Unlike most varieties, sugary cassava is not 
predominantly starch (Carvalho et al., 2004). Vieira et al. (2011) found genetic differences between sugary and non-sugary 
cassava varieties in terms of carbohydrate reserves. According to Carvalho et al. (2004), the difference in the distribution patterns 
of starch and free sugars can be attributed to the hydrolysis of 
starch either by the phosphorylytic degradation mechanism or by the cleavage of starch by a series of starch hydrolytic 
enzymes, such as that occurring during seed germination in 
cereals, or by both.
In biotechnological processes used in PHA production, 
such as submerged fermentation, sugary cassava stands out as an attractive carbon source because it can be used to prepare Production of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate by Pseudomonas oleovorans 
grown in sugary cassava extract supplemented with andiroba oil

Pseudomonas oleovorans  were grown on sugary cassava extracts supplemented with andiroba oil for the synthesis of a medium-
chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHAMCL). The concentration of total sugars in the extract was approximately: 40 g/L in 
culture 1, 15 g/L in cultures 2 and 3, and 10 g/L in culture 4. Supplementation with 1% andiroba oil and 0.2 g/L of (NH4)2HPO4 
was performed 6.5 hours after growth in culture 3, and supplementation with the same amount of andiroba oil and 2.4 g/L of 
(NH4)2HPO4 was performed at the beginning of growth in culture 4. The synthesis resulted mainly in 3-hydroxy-decanoate 
and 3-hydroxy-dodecanoate units; 3-hydroxy-butyrate, 3-hydroxy-hexanoate; and 3-hydroxy-octanoate monomers were also produced but in smaller proportions. P . oleovorans  significantly accumulated PHA
MCL in the deceleration phase of growth with an 
oxygen limitation but with sufficient nitrogen concentration to maintain cell growth. The sugary cassava extract supplemented with andiroba oil proved to be a potential substrate for PHA
MCL production.

(glucose and fructose) (Vieira et al., 2011). Thus, the starch 
hydrolysis step may be omitted in the production of fermentable 
sugars that are able to sustain bacterial growth and biopolymer 
production, reducing production costs.
Since the cost of PHA production is much higher than that 
of non-biodegradable synthetic plastics, alternative production 
methods have been explored, including the maximization of 
carbon conversion and the productivity of bioprocesses using less expensive carbon sources (Steinbüchel, 2010; Bera et al., 2015; Berezina et al., 2014). Accordingly, the present study 
aimed to produce PHA
MCL by P . oleovorans  isolate using sugary 
cassava extract with and without fatty acid supplementation 
(andiroba oil).
2 Material and methods
2.1 Microorganism, sugary cassava extract, and andiroba oil
The bacteria Pseudomonas oleovorans , ATCC29347 isolate, 
was provided by the Department of Biochemistry at the Center of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The microorganism was maintained at 25 °C on a solid 
culture medium containing (per liter): 10.0 g of tryptone, 5.0 g 
of yeast extract, 5.0 g of sodium chloride, and 15.0 g of Agar.
A producer in the state of Pará, Brazil (Latitude 01° 27’ 21” 
S and Longitude 48° 30’ 16” W) provided the sugary cassava 
roots. To prepare the sugary cassava extract, the roots were washed, peeled, and ground using an industrial blender (POLI LS-4, Siemsen, Brazil). The material was filtered through 60 and 200 mesh sieve; the eluted fraction was allowed to stand and 
the starch was decanted. The supernatant – the sugary cassava 
extract – was separated and stored at –18 °C until use.
The andiroba oil was obtained through mechanical 
extraction by mechanical pressing of the andiroba kernels (Carapa guianensis Aubl.) using a continuous screw press 
(MP e-40 R, ecirtec, Brazil). The extract was pumped through 
a filter press (FP e-25/10 AC, ecirtec, Brazil) and refrigerated 
(5 °C) in the dark until use.
2.2 Bioreactor
A stainless steel airlift bioreactor with external circulation 
and a working capacity of 5 liters was used. The reactor was 
equipped with control systems for pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Sterilization of the air filtration membrane (PTFe, 0.2 mm, Millipore) and the acid and base solutions was performed at 121 °C for 20 min. The bioreactor was sterilized 
with direct steam.
2.3 Characterization of the sugary cassava extract and the 
andiroba oil
Glucose, fructose, and sucrose concentrations in the sugary 
cassava extract were assessed in a reaction medium containing 
ATP , NAD+ and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), to which hexokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), and invertase (or β-fructosidase) were sequentially added to assess the sugars. In this process, hexokinase mediates phosphorylation 
of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) using ATP . Next, G6P is oxidized by G6PDH to gluconate-6-phosphate using 
NAD+ as the oxidant coenzyme. PGI converts fructose-6-
phosphate (F6P) into G6P , and β-fructosidase converts sucrose into glucose + fructose. NADH production was detected by the change of absorbance intensity at 340 nm measured 
using a spectrophotometer adapted to an e lisa plate reader 
(Praxedes et al., 2006). Moisture, ash, and protein (6.25 nitrogen-
to-protein conversion factor) of the sugary cassava extract were also assessed using official methods (Association of Official Anaytical, 1997). The primary fatty acids in the andiroba oil were quantified by gas chromatography in accordance with Darnet et al. (2011).
2.4 Inoculum and culture medium preparation
The inoculum was produced from a pre-inoculum that 
was prepared inoculating a single colony and transferred to an 
erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of sterile sugary cassava 
extract (120 °C/20 min). The culture was incubated for 18 hours 
at 30 °C under orbital shaking of 0.55 g. Following incubation, the pre-inoculum was transferred to another flask with 400 mL of extract, which was kept under aeration by injection of sterile air (filtered in a 0.2 mm PTFe Millipore membrane) for 24 hours 
at 30 °C.
As for the cultures in the bioreactor, 1 M HCl was initially 
added to the extract until pH 3.8; this step was performed 
for precipitation of carotenoids that give the extract a yellow color and which were later removed by filtration (Watman No. 12 filter). Next, the extract was supplemented with the following nutrients (per liter): 5.8 g of K
2HPO4, 3.7 g of KH2PO4, 
0.25 g of MgSO4.7H2O, and 1.6 g of (NH4)2HPO4. Following 
supplementation, 1 M NaOH was added to adjust the pH to 7.0. 
Andiroba oil supplementation was performed during cultivation 
in the bioreactor. The culture media were preheated to 100 °C for 60 minutes before inoculation and later cooled to 30 °C.
2.5 Cultures
Four cultures (Pseudomonas oleovorans+culture medium) 
were grown in the bioreactor under the following conditions: 
culture 1 - sugary cassava extract with approximately 40 g/L 
of total sugars; culture 2 - sugary cassava extract diluted to approximately 15 g/L of total sugars; culture 3 - same diluted extract as that of culture 2 but supplemented with 1% (v/v) andiroba oil and 0.2 g/L of (NH
4)2HPO4 after 6.5 hours of 
growth; and culture 4 - sugary cassava extract diluted to approximately 10 g/L of total sugars, supplemented with 1% (v/v) andiroba oil and 2.4 g/L of (NH
4)2HPO4 at the onset of 
growth.
In each culture, 4.5 L of culture medium were used, to 
which 1 mL/L of polypropylene glycol antifoam was added. 
The medium was transferred to the bioreactor under aseptic 
conditions following heat treatment (100 °C/1 hour) and cooling (30 °C). Aeration and oxygen saturation (> 20 min) 
were initiated after the temperature of the medium stabilized at 
30 °C. Following this step, 500 mL of inoculum were aseptically Polyhydroxyalkanoates of sugary cassava and andiroba oil by P . oleovorans
Food Sci. Technol, Campinas, 34(4): 738-745, Oct.-Dec. 2014 740introduced into the bioreactor, which resulted in an initial 
biomass concentration of 0.5 g/L. The control system was 
programmed to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration 
above the critical level, pre-set at 13%, which required an airflow 
rate from 0.25 to 1.3 vvm (volume of air per volume of reaction 
per minute). The air pressure at the top of the bioreactor was 
maintained at 50.7 kPa during the periods of higher oxygen 
demand.
2.6 Analytical assessments during growth
To monitor the cultures, 15 mL aliquots were taken 
consecutively, which were initially centrifuged for cell separation 
at 8000 g for 5 minutes. Cell concentration was determined by 
gravimetry through oven drying (75 °C) to a constant weight. 
Residual glucose and nitrogen were quantified in the supernatant 
by an enzymatic-colorimetric method using a commercial kit 
(Gold Analisa, Brazil) (Trinder, 1969). The dry cell mass was 
subjected to acid methanolysis, as described by Braunegg et al. 
(1978) and with the modifications proposed by Brandl et al. 
(1988), for PHA quantification. A gas chromatograph (GC-2014, 
Shimadzu, Columbia) with a flame ionization detector (FID) 
was used in the identification and quantification of PHAs. A fused silica capillary column (Supelcowax 10, 0.32 mm x 30 m) 
was utilized. The carrier gas was hydrogen at 20 mL/min, and 
the temperatures at injection, detection, and at the column were 
250 °C, 280 °C and 50 °C, respectively. A standard curve was 
constructed with the following standards: P(3HO-co -3HHx), 
(92.71% 3HO and 7.29% 3HHx), P(3HD-co- 3HDd-co- 3HO), 
and (50.59% 3HD, 15.07% 3HDd, 34.33% 3HOx).
2.7 Mathematical treatment
Cell growth during the exponential phase is described by 
equation 1; the integrated form of which (e quation 2) was used 
to determine the maximum specific growth rate (m
max), which 
is the slope of the ln X versus  t correlation. Conversely, the 
biomass yield coefficient (YX/S) of a batch culture at a constant 
volume is defined by e quation 3; the slope of its integrated form 
(equation 4) therefore enabled the determination of YX/S. Linear regression analysis was conducted using Microsoft Office e xcel 
2007 software.
dX/dt = mmax X (1)
ln X = ln Xo + mmax t (2)
YX/S = −(dX/dS) (3)
YX/S = (X–Xo)/(So–S) (4)
where X = biomass concentration (g/L), Xo = initial biomass 
concentration (g/L), S = substrate concentration (g/L); So = 
initial substrate concentration (g/L), μmax = maximum specific 
growth rate (h–1), t = time (h), and YX/S = biomass yield 
coefficient (gX/gS).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Proximate composition of sugary cassava extract and 
andiroba oil
The sugary cassava extract, which represented 61.40% of the 
root weight, had 94.15% (±0.11) moisture, 0.12% (±0.08) ashes, 
0.19% (±0.03) proteins, 1.29% (±0.09) sucrose, 2.26% (±0.04) glucose, and 1.65% (±0.06) fructose. The high concentrations 
of free sugars demonstrated that sugary cassava extract is an 
excellent source of fermentable sugars.
According to its fatty acid profile, andiroba oil had 0.21% 
myristic acid (C14:0), 28.29% palmitic acid (C16:0), 1.07% palmitoleic acid (C16:1), 8.46% stearic acid (C18:0), 50.70% 
oleic acid (C18:1), 9.88% linoleic acid (C18:2), and 1.39% 
linolenic acid (C18:3). Abreu et al. (2004) found a similar profile for andiroba oil.
3.2 Polyhydroxyalkanoate production in Airlift bioreactor
Figure 1 shows the results obtained for culture 1, in which 
sugary cassava extract was the only carbon source. Figure 1a 
shows that there was cell growth for approximately up to 12 hours under those conditions; at that time, practically all 
Figure 1. Culture 1: (a) kinetics for biomass parameters (■), residual nitrogen (●), residual glucose (○) and PHA (●); (b) dissolved oxygen in 
the culture medium.Aires da Silva et al.
Food Sci. Technol, Campinas, 34(4): 738-745, Oct.-Dec. 2014 741nitrogen was consumed, and a stationary phase of bacterial 
growth was initiated. From that point onwards, there was no 
noticeable variation in substrate consumption, and the medium retained approximately 12 g/L of residual glucose at the end 
of the process, which indicated that the P . oleovorans  did not 
consume the entire substrate. The culture produced a biomass yield coefficient (Y
X/S) of 0.19 gX/gS, a maximum speciﬁc growth 
rate (μmax) of 0.25 h–1, the exponential growth phase lasted up 
to five hours, and the maximum biomass concentration was 
3.20 g/L in 16 hours of cultivation.
The critical oxygen level during culture growth was 13% 
of saturation level; below this level, oxygen is limited. Thus, 
dissolved oxygen was limited in the medium during virtually 
all growth ( Figure  1b). The bioreactor therefore had to be 
pressurized with 25 kPa even before the first hour of growth to prevent the concentration of dissolved oxygen from reaching values close to zero. The pressure was adjusted to 100 kPa after 
the third hour of growth and maintained at that condition 
until the end of the process. Despite the high oxygen demand observed, oxygen may have been limited because of the osmotic 
stress of the cell resulting from the high concentration of 
substrate; this hypothesis must not be overlooked because the 
exponential phase was not well-characterized, including the 
times that oxygen was above the critical concentration. Under the conditions of culture 1, the PHA production reached a 
maximum of 6.26% after 24 hours of growth, and the product 
yield coefficient (Y
P/S) was 0.0034 gP/gS.
The performance of culture 1 indicated the need to reduce 
the carbon/oxygen ratio in the culture medium to avoid or minimize oxygen limitation. Therefore, in culture 2, the 
concentration of total sugars in the sugary cassava extract was 
reduced to approximately 15 g/L. Under this condition, cell growth time was reduced to eight hours (Figure 2a), which was 
four hours less than that of culture 1; there was an increase in the maximum specific growth rate (µ
max = 0.36 h–1), and the 
exponential growth phase was also extended to up to five hours of growth, which coincided with the point at which the oxygen concentration became critical (Figure 2b). The maximum biomass concentration was 3.20 g/L in 16 hours of growth 
under the same conditions as those of culture 1; however, the 
biomass yield coefficient (Y
X/S = 0.26 gX/gS) and the product 
yield coefficient (YP/S = 0.0084 gP/gS) were higher in culture 2. 
Substrate dilution improved bacterial growth conditions, but the maximum PHA concentration (6.50%) had the same order 
of magnitude as that of culture 1 in 16 hours of growth. The 
consumption of the previously synthesized PHA was observed thereafter, which indicated that the use of P . oleovorans  requires 
special attention in the control of high stress. Huijberts et al. (1992) identified intracellular enzymes in P . oleovorans  named 
PHA depolymerases, and Knoll et al. (2009) reported that this family of enzymes hydrolyzes intracellular PHA granules under extreme environmental conditions, such as nutrient and oxygen 
limitation.
Based on the finding that the point of nitrogen limitation 
coincided with the end of the cellular growth phase in culture 
2, although at low levels of carbon (<4 g/ L of glucose), a new cultivation condition was defined to enable the maintenance 
of that microbial stress point for a longer period of time 
and to increase the accumulation of PHA in cells. Thus, the 
concentration of total sugars in the sugary cassava extract was 
maintained at approximately 15 g/L in culture 3, but the culture medium was supplemented with 0.2 g/L of (NH
4)2HPO4 as a 
source of nitrogen and with 1% (v/v) andiroba oil as a lipid co-substrate. Supplementations were performed after 6.5 hours of growth because nitrogen limitation occurred at that time 
in culture 2 (Figure 2a), and the culture, which had not yet 
reached stationary phase that would minimize the effect of 
supplementation with andiroba oil on cell growth and enable 
the production of lipases that are responsible for the hydrolysis and release of fatty acids.
Cell growth lasted up to ten hours in culture 3, and the 
exponential growth phase lasted up to 8 hours of cultivation, 
higher than the 5 hour-growth observed in cultures 1 and 2. The 
maximum specific growth rate (m
max = 0.23 h–1) and the biomass 
yield coefficient (YX/S = 0.17 gX/gS) of culture 3 were lower than 
those of culture 2, but the maximum biomass concentration

Food Sci. Technol, Campinas, 34(4): 738-745, Oct.-Dec. 2014 742(X = 3.61 g/L) in 24 hours of cultivation and the product yield 
coefficient (YP/S = 0.0340 gP/gS) were higher. The concentration 
of dissolved oxygen in culture 3 reached the critical limit 
(Figure  3b) in less time than in culture 2 (Figure  2b), but that critical condition remained the same in both cultures for 
virtually the same period of time. PHA production in culture 3 reached a maximum of 15.96% in 24 hours of process, which 
is more than twice the production observed in cultures 1 and 2 
and is attributable to the addition of andiroba oil.
According to Figure 3a, supplementation with (NH
4)2HPO4 
in culture 3 kept the nitrogen concentration constant (≈ 0.6 g/L) 
for approximately 2 hours thereafter; after this point, the nitrogen 
concentration decreased again until it reached the critical limit 
after approximately 15 hours of cultivation. There was a sudden 
increase in dissolved oxygen to a concentration above the critical 
(Figure  3b) at approximately 10 hours of cultivation, which 
indicates a deceleration of bacterial metabolism, as confirmed by the maintenance of 4 g/L of residual glucose in the medium 
(Figure 3a), from the point of nitrogen limitation.
The performance observed under the conditions of culture 
3 suggests that P .  oleovorans  significantly accumulated PHA in the deceleration phase of growth under oxygen limitation 
but with sufficient nitrogen to sustain growth under limiting 
conditions, which prevented cellular metabolic processes and 
polymer production processes from stopping. Smet et al. (1983) 
and Huisman et al. (1992) found similar results and observed 
an increase in biomass following nutrient limitation, which was 
related to PHA accumulation.
Culture 4 was formulated based on the results of culture 3 
but with an increase in nitrogen concentration to 2.4 g/L and 
a reduction in the concentration of sugars in sugary cassava 
extract to approximately 10 g/L of glucose. Culture 4 was supplemented with nitrogen and andiroba oil at the onset of 
the cultivation; enzyme production was thus induced from 
the start of the process, increasing the availability of acil-CoA 
produced by β-oxidation of fatty acids (Du & Yu 2002), which 
was immediately incorporated into the polymer when stress 
conditions favored PHA production.
The results of culture 4 are shown in Figure 4. Cell growth 
was linear in that culture (Figure  4a), indicating limitation 
in the first hours of the process, which was confirmed by the maintenance of the oxygen concentration in the system

Food Sci. Technol, Campinas, 34(4): 738-745, Oct.-Dec. 2014 743near or above the critical concentration during the entire 
process (Figure 4b). Although biomass production in culture 
4 was less than half of that observed in the remaining cultures (1.54 g/L), this process conditions resulted in the highest PHA 
concentration (18.41%). There was an increase of the maximum 
specific growth rate (m
max = 0.27 h–1) and the biomass yield 
coefficient (YX/S = 0.23 gX/gS) in relation to culture 3, but the 
product yield coefficient (YP/S = 0.0270 gP/gS) decreased.
Table 1 shows the main products of the four cultures, 
and it can be seen that the copolymers predominantly produced were 3-hydroxy-decanoate (3HD) and 3-hydroxy-dodecanoate (3HDD). The monomers 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB), 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx), and 3-hydroxy-octanoate (3HO) were also incorporated. Co-polymers with short- and medium-chain-length monomeric units were produced mainly 
when the sugary cassava extract was supplemented with 
andiroba oil. In studies using other strains of Pseudomonas  
and mixtures of lipids and carbohydrates as carbon sources, Ashby  et  al. (2001) and Costa  et  al. (2009) did not detect production of these copolymers. On the other hand, Srivastava & Tripathi (2013) observed production of PHAs with short- and medium-chain-length in a study using Alcaligenes sp. strains and fructose supplemented with palmitic, stearic, oleic, and 
linoleic fatty acids. This type of polymer can have highly specific 
applications because it has physical and chemical properties that are intermediate between crystalline polymers, such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and elastomers, namely medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA
MCL).
There is a relevant aspect obtained in the present study 
(Table 2) that relates to stoichiometric results. In general, the biomass yield coefficient (Y
X/S) were low compared to the values 
found by Durner et al. (2000) (0.62 to 0.97 gX/gS), who studied 
poly[(R)-3-hydroxyalkanoates] accumulation in P . oleovorans  
using octanoate as a substrate. The performance observed here can be attributed to the metabolic flux that is related to PHA 
production with respect to the use of cellular energy or as a 
result of physical impediments by the intracellular granules formed preventing cell division, which contributed to low biomass production.
A study conducted by e scapa  et  al. (2012) on the 
distribution of energy involved in the metabolic flux of PHA accumulation in wild-type and genetically modified strains of Pseudomonas putida  showed that there was an increase of acetyl 
CoA synthesis at low levels of nitrogen, which was detrimental to the PHA cycle. According to these authors, the excess of acetyl-CoA favored the citric acid cycle, increasing respiration and CO
2 production and thus hindering biomass production and 
dissipating energy. In that case, PHA synthesis in P . putida  would 
be a method of channeling excess energy and thus maintaining the equilibrium and energy balance of bacterial metabolism.
The pre-assumptions shown may be used as the basis to 
explain the low biomass yield coefficient (Y
X/S) observed in the 
current study. However, there is a need for more specific studies examining the metabolism of PHA accumulation in P . oleovorans  
under these conditions. Nevertheless, the findings of the present 
study indicate that a process with separate cellular growth and biopolymer production phases would be an effective strategy 
to increase PHA production. In the growth phase, particular 
focus should be directed toward oxygen supply, ensuring that 
its concentration is maintained above the critical level and at a convenient carbon/nitrogen ratio. In the phase of biopolymer 
accumulation, supplementation with lipid co-substrate and the 
maintenance of limiting levels of oxygen are key conditions. The 
process can be studied in an airlift bioreactor, but it requires the application of other forms of operation, including a continuous 
cultivation phase to keep cell concentrations low and to avoid 
oxygen limitation and a batch phase in another reactor with oil 
supplementation and oxygen limitation. Providing conditions 
that limit cell growth by controlling oxygen is much more 
practical than using any other nutrient.
4 Conclusions
P . oleovorans  accumulated PHA in sugary cassava extract 
supplemented with andiroba oil in the deceleration phase of growth and under oxygen-limiting conditions. This process 
is an attractive alternative to produce biopolymers because 
controlling dissolved oxygen in bioreactors is simpler than controlling other nutrients. However, conditions of high 
stress must be avoided because they favor the intracellular 
depolymerization of previously synthesized PHA. Co-polymers 
with short- and medium-chain-length monomeric units were 
produced, which may have highly specific applications. The 
two-stage process (biomass accumulation and PHA production 
separately) may be a useful strategy to optimize the production 
process of these biopolymers.
