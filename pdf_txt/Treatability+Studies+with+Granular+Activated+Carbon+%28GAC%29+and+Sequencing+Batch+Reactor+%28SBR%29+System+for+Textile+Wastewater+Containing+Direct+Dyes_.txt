To improveaerobic treatment of wastewater, cultivation of aerobic granu-
lar sludgeseems to be useful. Since excess nitrate and phosphate com-
pounds promoteforming algal blooms and eutrophication in receiving
water, in recent years many investigations have been conductedto improve
the efficiency of COD, nitrogen and phosphate removal. Applying aero-
bic granular sludge is a novel and promising technique due to its advan-
tages over conventional activated sludge process and sequencing batch
reactor (SBR) such as improved settling ability and higher biomass reten-
tion as well as capable of toleration significantly higher organic loading
rates because of their ability to retain biomass. In this study, a mini-re-
view over papers and patents in this field was done.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years many investigations have been
conducted for improving the efficiency of activated
sludge wastewater treatment systems in order to ap-
proach stringent discharge standards. On the other
hand, nitrogen elimination is necessary to control
eutrophication since excess nitrate stimulates
theformation of algal blooms in receiving water[1].
A conventional activated sludge has several disad-
vantages such as relatively high energy consump-
tion, high biomass production, sludge bulking, large
reactor volume required, sensitivity to shock load-
ing, high operation costs and problems associated
to the disposal of large amount of sludge[2]. Waste-
water treatment with sequencing batch reactor (SBR)is a better alternative, compared to the activated
sludge process. SBRs offer various advantages, in-
cluding minimal spacerequirements and ease of man-
agement[3]. Besides, SBRsand modified SBRs have
been successfully applied to treat complex chemi-
cal wastewaters[4-6], and also they are able to re-
move nitrogen compounds[7-8].
SBR cycle consists of five phases (filling, aera-
tion, settling, decanting and idle); but for nitrogen
and phosphorous removal,maintaining anaerobic
aerobic condition (with anoxic and aeration phases
in each cycle) is necessary.
Wastewater treatment using biofilm is another
method that has obtained especial consideration due
tosome drawbacks of activated sludge process. A
biofilm is by definition a layer of prokaryotic orEnvironmental Science

The main challenging termcorresponded to the ap-
plication of aerobic biofilms is the three-phase sepa-
ration of water, air, and biomass during imposing
different hydraulic loading rate (OLR)[10, 11]. Aero-
bic and anaerobic granules are considered as one of
the biofilm varieties.
The granulation is classified into two catego-
ries: anaerobic and aerobic. Strong and compact
microbial structure, less sedimentation time, im-
proved settling ability and higher biomass retention
as well as capability of tolerating significantly higher
OLRs because of granules ability to retain biomass
are the main advantages of the aerobic granules over
conventional activated sludge flocs[12]. Through aero-
bic granulation, access to the concentrated SBR is
possible. Due to shorter settling time compared to
conventional SBR, more cycled could be done. By
granule formation, the concentration of sludge will
increase, which is due to a decrease in sludge vol-
ume index[13].
Granules are able to treat the wastewater with
high OLR because they have ability to preserve the
biomass. Whiles activated sludge systems are able
to treat wastewater with OLR of 0.5 to 2 kgCOD.m-
3.d-1[14].
One of the weak points of aerobic granules is
the diffusion barrier. Although diffusion barrier can
be removed because of formation of channels within
the granules[15]. The concentration of oxygen could
immediately decrease to 0 at the high depth of gran-
ules. This depth depends on the oxygen utilization
rate, porosity, and challenging of granules. The typi-
cal depth of aerobic region in microbial biofilm un-
der aerobic condition is 50-200 µm. The bacterial
existed in anaerobic region will produce gases and
organic acids that can damage granules. So, for con-
fidence about the stability of aerobic granules, their
diameter must be less than two times of thickness of
aerobic layer[16].
Jing et al. (2002) assessed the applicability of
aerobic granular sludge in treating wastewater con-
taining considerable amount of phenol by column-
type sequential aerobic sludge blanket reactor main-
tained at a loading rate of 1.5 g phenol.L-1.d-1. Theyreported that at the phenol concentration of 2 g.L-1,
the maximum specific phenol degradation rate was
achieved[17].
Jang et al. (2003) applied aerobic granules to
simultaneously remove nitrogen and COD in a SBR.
The maximum nitrification efficiency of up to 97%
and COD removal efficiency of up to 95% were
achieved[18]. Tsuneda et al. applied an aerobic
upflow fluidized bed (AUFB) reactor in a nitrifica-
tion process for inorganic wastewater containing 500
g.m-3of NH+4-N through granulation of nitrifying bac-
teria. They reported that nitrifying granules were
detected in the reactor after operation for 100 days,
and their size increased to 346mm after 300 days[19].
If granules are large enough for the diffusion of phos-
phorous and nitrogen into core and inhibit reaction
hold up, nitrite will advance simultaneous re-
moval[20].
Moussavi et al. (2010) studied the degradation
of phenol of a saline wastewater in aerobic granu-
lar SBR. They assessed the effect of inlet concen-
tration of phenol, cycle time, filling cycle time, shock
loading, and total dissolved solids (TDS) concen-
tration on the performance of the reactor. They re-
ported that the aerobic granular SBR could remove
more than 99% of influent phenol at inlet phenol con-
centrations of up to 1000mg/L, total cycle time of
17h (15.5h aerating, 1h filling, and 30min settling,
decanting and idle) and TDS concentrations up to
8%[21].
GRANULE FORMATION
Granulation can be stated as aggregation of cells
through cell to cell immobilization for forming the
contiguous multicellular community[22]. To form
granular sludge in aerobic systems, the settling time
should be decreased to values that only particles
with the ability to form granules can stay in reac-
tor[20]. Due to electrostatic forces and hydration in-
teractions, bacteria naturally have no interest in ag-
gregation and granulation[23].
As was stated before, there are two types of
granulation (aerobic and anaerobic). Up-flow
anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) is a culture to grow
anaerobic granules. Microorganisms in UASB haveMoein Hedayati Moghaddam et al. 181
Critical ReviewESAIJ, 11(6) 2015
An Indian JournalEnvironmental Science Environmental Scienceto grow in granular form, if it does not, they will be
washed out by continuous up flow stream[13]. It is
important to note that UASBs are able to treat waste-
water with OLR of 40 kg COD m-3d-1[14]. Anaerobic
granules have several disadvantages such as long
start-up time, fairly high operative temperature,poor
capability for nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous)
removalandthey are not useful for treating waste-
water with low OLRs[24].
Since granulation has been investigated in the
context of methanogenic systems, it is assumed that
special syntrophic bacterial interactions have the
fundamental role in this process, whereas granula-
tion is not limited only to methanogenic bacteria.
But rather, granulation of acidogenic bacteria, nitri-
fying bacteria, denitrifying bacteria, and aerobic
heterotrophic bacteria have been reported[13].
Beun et al. (1999) described the aerobic granu-
lation in a SBR as follows: During the start-up pe-
riod, main part of biomass in the reactor is filamen-
tous mycelium. Because of stress in the reactor, the
filamentous bacteria would be detached from the
surface of pellets and the pellets would be denser,
consequently. The granules grow until their dimen-
sion approach to 5-6 mm and their inner part de-
compose due to lack of oxygen. It is seemed that the
mycelium pellets act as a matrix in which colonies
of bacteria grew on it. After collapsing of the myce-
lium pellets because of cellular decomposition, the
bacterial colonies would save themselves because
they are large enough for settling. These micro colo-
nies grew and turned to granules and finally the bac-
terial population could be predominant[13].
In another study, Zheng et al. (2006) studied the
aerobic granule formation in a SBR. They reported
that during the first 14 days of start-up period, no
significant change in sludge morphology was ob-
served. The only considerable change was sludge
color turn from grayish brown to yellow. On day 15
tiny yellow granules appeared. During the next 15
days (15-30 days), the aerobic granules grew in size
gradually. On day 33, filamentous bacteria were
observed on the granule surface led to weak settling
ability. On day 40, the settling sludge ability was
recovered. Thereafter, the black granules appeared
and yellow granules vanished gradually. On day 55,only black granules existed in the reactor[25].
So far all the aerobic granulation only took place
in SBR and continuous environments did not earn
any successes in this field. The reason of this phe-
nomenon has not been specified clearly, yet[22].
The effects of operative parameters
The operative parameters that would influence
the mechanism and performance of granular sludge
formation are composition of wastewater, organic
loading rate, feast-famine condition of organic com-
pound, reactor design, auxiliary agent, settlement
time, volumetric exchange ratio, aeration rate (hy-
drodynamic shear force), and intermittent feeding that
are explained in following:
Loading rate of substrate
Unlike anaerobic granulation, in aerobic granu-
lation a wide range of organic loading rate was re-
ported (2.5-15 kgCOD.m-3.d-1). Liu et al. (2005) con-
cluded that the concentration of substrate had no ef-
fect on granulation but influenced the kinetic behav-
ior of granules[22]. Studies on granular sludge re-
vealed that aerobic granulation faced difficulty as
OLR decreased. As an example, aerobic granula-
tion for municipal wastewater with low OLR (less
than 1 kgCOD.m-3.d-1) is very slow, which leads to
much times to reach steady state[20].
Tay et al. (2004) reported that in laboratory-scale
sequentialaerobic sludge blanket reactor (SASBR)
for OLRs of 1 and 2 kg COD.m-3.d-1, aerobic granu-
lation was not observed. For OLR of 4 kg COD.m-
3.d-1 aerobic granules appeared after 12 d and even-
tually grew and became stable. After 18 days of op-
eration at the OLR of 8 kg COD.m-3.d-1unstable aero-
bic granules were appeared[26].
Moy et al. (2002) reported that at OLR of 6
kgCOD.m-3.d-1 granules based on glucose substrate
had fluffy structure, which SEM images revealed that
filamentous bacteria are predominant. But at OLR
of 9 kgCOD.m-3.d-1, the irregular morphology of gran-
ules are smoother while increasing the OLR to 12
and 15 kgCOD.m-3.d-1 led to similar granules with
larger diameter. Generally, an increase in OLR leads
to better settling properties[14].
Liu et al. (2003) studied the effect of OLR on. 182 A mini-review onaerobic granular sludge cultivation
Critical ReviewESAIJ, 11(6) 2015
An Indian JournalEnvironmental Science Environmental Sciencecell hydrophobicity and reported that cell hydropho-
bicity was not dependent on OLR. It seemed that the
aerobic heterotrophic granulation isinsensitive to
OLR in the range of 1.5-9 kgCOD.m-3.d-1[27].
Amount of OLR has no effect on formation of
aerobic granules. But physical properties of gran-
ules depend on the amount of OLR. By increasing
the OLR from 3 to 9 kg COD.m-3, the granule size
would raise from 1.6 to 1.9 mm. Similar phenom-
enon has been reported for anaerobic granules. In-
creasing the OLR would increase the growth rate of
microorganisms and decrease the stability of gran-
ules. In aerobic granulation system, hydraulic reten-
tion time (HRT) must be short enough to suppress
the growth of suspended particles and on the other
hand should be long enough to prepare the possibil-
ity of microbial growth and accumulation[23].
Diversity of Nutrients: an increase in ammonium
concentration leads to a decrease in the hydropho-
bicity property and an increase in polysaccharide
production, which damage the aerobic granulation.
Yang et al. (2004) reported that the presence of am-
monium inhibited the energy metabolism of bacteria
and therefore suppressed the aerobic granulation. By
increasing the N/COD ratio, the activity of nitrify-
ing and denitrifying bacteria would be increased.
But the population of heterotrophic bacteria would
decreases[23].
The COD/N greater than 90 leads to excessive
growth of filamentous bacteria, which damage set-
tling properties[20]. Yang et al. (2003) reported that
for granular sludge-SBR at high substrate N/COD
ratio, the nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria exhibit
high activity but the activity of heterotrophic bacte-
ria decreases as the N/COD was decreased[28]. Yang
et al. (2004) said that free ammonium significantly
decreased the cell hydrophobicity and cell polysac-
charides content that are responsible for failure in
aerobic granulation. Accordingly, theyconcluded that
aerobic granules formed only when the concentra-
tion of free ammonia was less than 23.5 mg.L-1[29].
Lin et al. (2003) reported that the size of P-ac-
cumulating granules decreased as P/COD in substrate
ratio increased, while the structure of the granules
became more compact and denser as P/COD ratio
increased[30].Hydrodynamic shear force
Hydrodynamic shear force could act as detach-
ment force. High detachment force leads to a com-
pact and dense biofilm[31]. Hydrodynamic shear force
would stimulate the production of cellular polysac-
charides, which has significant effect on the forma-
tion and stability of aerobic granules[32]. Liu et al.
(2003) reported that high shear force increased the
cell hydrophobicity, which would facilitate the aero-
bic granulation[27].
Feast-famine regime
Aeration phase in SBR consists of two parts. In
the first part, organic compound decompose and be
consumed by microorganisms. And in the second part,
microorganisms face with a lack in substrate. Dur-
ing famine period, the bacteria will be hydrophobic
and their aggregation will be feasible, consequently.
The aggregation of bacteria is their natural reaction
to sustain famine cycles[22]. High cell hydrophobic-
ity was essential for microbial aggregation and sus-
taining the aerobic granulation process[33].
From thermodynamic point of view, the hydro-
phobicity of bacteria will decrease the Gibbs free
energy of the surface that facilitates the relation be-
tween two bacteria and leads to more compact struc-
ture. On the other hand, the starveling clogs of bac-
teria connect to each other by fibrous links, which
facilitate the cell to cell connections[34].
Type of bacteria
Selection the bacteria with slower growth rate
leads to more stable granules. Accordingly, using
the compounds with slow degradability properties
produces bacteria with slow growth rate[35].
Feeding strategy
The results show that the high ratio of feast-fam-
ine or periodic feeding leads to the formation of com-
pact and dense granules[22].
Dissolved oxygen (DO)
Results show that the concentration of dissolved
oxygen has no drastic effect on granulation[22]. There
are several reports that the aerobic granules would
form at the DO level of 0.7 to 2 mg.L-1. So, DO is
not an effective parameter in the formation of aero-Moein Hedayati Moghaddam et al. 183

Reactor structure
The air bubble traverses a spiral path in SBR
that makes homogenous circular path and regional
vortex. The circular stream will arrange the clogs in
a manner that have the minimum surface free energy.
In the SBR column, high ratio of height to diameter
make perfect circular path that result in effective
hydraulic attrition on microbial clogs. Furthermore,
high ratio of H/D (the ratio of column height to col-
umn diameter) will make feasible the oxygen trans-
fer and leads to a smaller reactor. Recent reports
show that aerobic granulation takes place at various
ratio of H/D[22]. Due to importance of settling veloc-
ity, high H/D ratio is useful. On the other hand, short
settling time makes the reaction time longer[13]. High
H/D ratio leads to complete circular path and more
attrition. Also, bacteria would be separated from
each other according to their settling velocity. If con-
tinuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is used, gran-
ules would be subjected to regional hydrodynamic
force, raising stream, randomized collision[23]. In
TABLE 1, the structures of several reactors applied
for aerobic granulation have been explained.
Sludge retention time
In any research in recent 100 years, there was
no report about the granulation in activated sludge
with various SRT[22]. Accordingly, SRT will have
no effects on aerobic granulation.
Auxiliary agent
Nancharaiah et al. (2008) studied the effect of
Nitrilotriacetic acid as synthesized chelating agent
on the granulation on the substrate of acetate. They
reported that the diameter of aerobic granules would
increase by using the chelating agent[35]. Jiang et al.
(2003) investigated the effect of calcium ion on
granulation and reported that its positive effect is
due to establishment of a connection between posi-
tive ion and negative load of the bacteria surface[36].
Temperature and pH
Growth rate and the consequent competition of
microorganisms would be influenced by tempera-
ture variation[37]. Temperature and pH are importantparameters in anaerobic granulation, but consider-
able effect on aerobic granulation have not been re-
ported, yet. The investigation on the long-term ef-
fect of temperature showed that at low temperature,
the formation of granular sludge was hard and the
resulted sludge would be washed out and removed.
But if granular sludge forms at high temperature and
thereafter temperature decreases, the structure of
granular sludge would not being influenced dramati-
cally and only the removal of a few compounds
would be affected.[37].
Cycle time
Cycle time must be long to give the bacteria the
enough time for growth and aggregation. It is impor-
tant to note that if the cycle time is too long, the
bacteria will be hydrolyzed and the granules will
damage. Studies have shown that if the cycle time is
optimized but the settling time is more than 15 min,
the granulation will not take place[22].
Settling time
A short settling time leads to high cell hydro-
phobicity that contributes to aerobic granulation.
Besides, cell polysaccharides content increases as
settling time decreases. Cell polysaccharides have
significant role in bio-film integrity, which facili-
tate aerobic granulation[38].
Volume exchange ratio
Volume exchange ratio is the decanted volume
to the total volume of reactor. Higher exchange ratio
leads to better aerobic granulation. Wang et al.
(2006) studied the effect of volume exchange ratio
on aerobic granulation by four SBR with different
volume exchange ratio (20-80%). They reported that
a fast granulation occurred in the reactor with high-
est volume exchange ratio[39]. It is found from Stock
equation that the particles with high settling veloc-
ity are circular and weighted whiles small, light,
and unformed particles have slow settling velocity.
Accordingly, the only weighted bio-films stay in SBR
as volume exchange ratio increases.
Liu et al. (2001) investigated the effect of type
of substrate on aerobic granulation. They reported
that aerobic granules formed in reactor after two
weeks. They reported that substrate composed of. 184 A mini-review onaerobic granular sludge cultivation

An Indian JournalEnvironmental Science Environmental Scienceglucose and maltose stimulated the filamentous
growth. They reported that the type of substrate has
no effect on the pattern of granulation. The glucose
based granules have fluffy surface that is possibly
due to the presence of filamentous bacteria[34]. Tay
et al. (2002) reported that the type of substrate (glu-
cose and acetate)has no considerable effect on aero-
bic granulation, but their characteristics such as settle-
ability, granule size, physical strength, roundness,
hydrophobicity, and activity are comparable[40].
MORPHOLOGY OF AEROBIC GRANULES
Aerobic granules have multi-layer structure:
outer layer is aerobic and is a mixture of autotrophic
and heterotrophic bacteria, and anaerobic or anoxic
core, which consists of anaerobic or nitrifying mi-
croorganisms[37]. Aerobic ammonium oxidizing bac-
teria are present at the depth of 70-100 µm. Aerobic
granules consist of pores that are prolonged to the
depth of 900 µm and transfer oxygen and nutrient.
The maximum porosity was observed at the depth of
300-500 µm. Compact structure of polysaccharides
forms at the depth of 400 µm. Anaerobic bacteria
have been observed at the depth of 800-900 µm from
the granule surface. And a layer of dead bacteria
were detected at the depth of 800-900 µm[23]. Wantic
and Catler(2009) said that in a microbial popula-
tion, bacteria would be distributed in a manner that
each of them would have the best condition in envi-
ronment[42].CONCLUSION
The granulation is classified into two catego-
ries: anaerobic and aerobic. Strong and compact
microbial structure, less sedimentation time, im-
proved settling ability and higher biomass retention
as well as capability of tolerating significantly pretty
high organic loading rates (OLRs) because of gran-
ules ability to retain biomass are the main advan-
tages of the aerobic granules compared to conven-
tional activated sludge flocs. Aerobic granular sludge
make feasible the simultaneous COD and nutrients
removal.
