 Abstract  
Nitrogen in wastewater, along with phosphorus, needs to be removed to control eutrophication that 
affects the aquatic life when it occurs in water bodies. Recent developments in total nitrogen 
removal technology involve partial nitrification -denitrification and partial denitrification -
anammox (N -PDN -anammox)  processes , which reduce the energy and the external carbon source  
requirement . The objectives of this study were to investigate dynamic specific nitrite 
denitrification rates  (SDNRs) and kinetic parameters in a process that makes use of municipal 
wastewater alone (objective -1) and MWW with methanol as a complementary carbon source 
(Objective -2). Another objective of the study was to investigate and compare complete nitrite 
versus partial nitrate denitrification at a lower COD/N ratio and identify process control strategies 
and microbial composition for a successful partial denitrification ( PDN ) process.  
 
To achieve the first objective, a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) continuou sly fed with primary 
effluent and nitrite solution were operated at a hydraulic and solids retention time of 8.4 hrs and 
26-30 days, respectively. The SDNRs from the SBR, using MWW as a carbon source, were 
compared with those determined in four 1 L -batch r eactors using acetate as a carbon source. The 
SDNR was directly related to COD/N until a maximum SDNR (mgNO2 -N/mgVSS/d) of 0.07 for 
MWW and 0.4 for acetate occurred at COD/N ratios of 6 and 13, respectively; beyond this COD/N 
ratio, SDNR decreased. The rel ationships of SDNR with COD/N and F/M ratios were developed. 
This is the first nitrite denitrification study using MWW as a carbon source to determine the 
SDNRs and kinetic parameters and model a direct relation between SDNR and F/M ratio. 
Subsequently, th e nitrite denitrification process was assessed using methanol as a complementary 
carbon source for the first time. An SBR fed with primary effluent diluted 50% with distilled water 
by volume and nitrite solution was operated at an HRT of 8.4 hrs (30 L/d) a nd SRT of 16 -17 days 
for 110 days. The SDNR from the SBR was compared with those determined in 23 batch reactors 
employing municipal wastewater (MWW), methanol, nitrite, nitrate and a combination of nitrite 
and nitrate in various ratios. The maximum SDNR w as 0.52 mgN/mgVSS/d corresponding to 
COD/N ratios of 5.9 in the SBR, much higher than with MWW. However, the maximum nitrite 
SDNR was lower than the maximum observed batch nitrate 1.06 mgNO 3-N/mgVSS -d SDNR using 
the nitrite acclimatized biomass from the SB R. The nitrite denitrifier yields were also determined ii 
 for all cases. Lower SDNR values were determined at lower nitrite concentrations below the half -
saturation coefficient (KNO2). The higher SDNR rates due to methanol addition could be 
translated into 37 % and 86% of the capital and operating cost savings for post and pre -anoxic 
bioreactor, respectively; hence the addition of methanol as a complementary carbon source for 
nitrite denitrification can be considered as a mainstream process even for conditions carbon is not 
limiting in the MWW.  
 
Lastly, until today, understanding the fundamentals of partial denitrification (PDN) affecting 
nitrite accumulation over nitrate denitrification was not well understood. This includes 
characterizing partial denitrificati on versus complete denitrification with respect to kinetic 
parameters, microbiological composition and the overall denitrification performance. A study is 
conducted to investigate and compare the dynamic specific denitrification rates (SDNRs) from 
nitrate and nitrite at various COD/N ratios in two SBRs systems that use acetate. Both SBRs were 
12 L with a flow of 18 L/d. SBR1 (47 d -SRT) and SBR2 (31 d -SRT) were operated on for 126 
days, with HRT of 16 hrs, and fed with nitrite and nitrate, respectively. The maximum SDNRNO2 
and SDNRNO3 -NO2 during the cyclic tests were 0.69 and 2.67 mgN/mgVSS -d in SBR1 and 
SBR2, respectively. The optimum operating condition for PDN was found to be at minimum 
COD/N of 2.7 -3 with 79% nitrite accumulation. Higher COD/N of 6.7 and 9.8 also accumulate 
nitrite, but nitrite accumulated was denitrified. Kinetic parameters were also determined for nitrite 
in offline batch experiments (half -saturation coefficient KNO2 and the maximum specific growth 
rate) of 0.77 d -1. The taxonomic analys is showed  Zoogloea  genus (42% RA) in SBR1 was more 
responsible for nitrite denitrification, while  Thauera  genus in SBR2 with RA of 10% was more 
responsible for PDN. We relate the difference in microbial structure to the NiR reductase and NaR 
reductase dist ribution among microbial structure, indicating NiR reductase enzymes are higher 
in Zoogolea  genera than NaR reductase. In contrast, NaR is higher than NiR in  Thauera. This study 
considered to be the first study to compare the microbial community structure for denitrification 
from nitrite and nitrate, which proves that denitrification from nitrate is much higher than from 
nitrite and nitrite accumulation will occur at high COD/N; however, this study clarified that more 
than 80% nitrite accumulation at high C OD/N of 10.

Introduction  
1.1 Rational  
The forms of Nitrogen in water  bodies , in general,  are organic nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate and 
nitrite , which have a deleterious effect on human health and in aquatic life, causing  eutrophication.  
Moreover, intermediate nitrogen oxides have very harmful effect s. N itrite is very toxic to 
microorganisms compared with nitrate, nitric oxide (NO) has a toxic effect on bacter ia, and nitrous 
oxide (N 2O) is one of the major greenhouse gases that cause ozone depletion, which is increasing 
globally at an alarming rate of 0.31% per year (Pan et al., 2013) , and has radiative effect 300 times 
stronger than carbon dioxide . Therefore, the removal of nitrogen compounds from wastewater is 
essential.  
The tradi tional biological nutrient removal ( BNR ) processes involve high dissolved oxygen (high 
energy), high quantities of external carbon source, larger footprint of the treatment facilities and 
huge sludge quantities that requires sludge treatment facilities. Recently,  emerging  BNR  
technologies , such as partial nitrification -anammox ( PNA ), nitrite shunt ( partial  nitrification -
denitrification, PNA -DN), and nitrification -partial denitrification -anammox ( N-PDN -anammox) 
are of researchers’ interest because of their economic  and sustainable  values. Of these  nitrite shunt 
and N-PDN -anammox  have shown promise  for main stream municipal wastewater treatment; both 
processes require an understanding of denitrification from nitrite.  
Extensive research has been conducted on denitrification from nitrate to determine t he optimum 
process parameters  (Beccari et al., 1983; Frison et al., 2013) ; however, not much work has been 
conducted on denitrification from nitrite as such, it has become an emerging topic . A review of the 
literature showed the electron distribution among the four types of nitrogen oxide (NO 3-/NO 2-
/NO/N 2O) with methanol as electron donor, but the effect of internal carbon source (municipal 
wastewater) on the denitrification rates was not considered, which will provide better expectation 
in the design of biological nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment plants  (Adav et al., 2010) . 
Thus, the optimum COD/N for external and internal carbon source that provides the maximum 2 
 SDNR when nitrite is used as the electron acceptor must be determined  (Ginige et al., 2009 and 
Akunna et al., 1992) .  Often  due to low carbon to nitrogen ratio in internal carbon source 
(municipal wastewater) , the denitrification process in full -scale wastewater treatment plants 
employ s external carbon sources to minimize total n itrogen effluent. Previous research  studied the 
effect of a mixture of carbon sources on nitrate denitrification. As per the literature review, the 
effect of the mixture of real wastewater and external carbon source on denitrification from nitrite 
has not yet been reported. Accordingly, an optimum ratio of external and internal carbon 
(municipal  wastewater) sources, kinetics and potential competitive effects of the two types of 
carbon source s are unknown.  
Partial denitrification is the latest advance in the second generation total nitroen ( TN) removal 
processes. The process is used to partially denitrify nitrate and maximize nitrite accumulation that 
will be used as an electron acceptor in a dow nstream anammox process. In this process, the PDN, 
more specifically, the nitrite accumulation is the limiting step. A review of the literature showed 
different strategies to enhance nitrite accumulation during denitrification from nitrate  (Du et al., 
2016  and Ma et al., 2017) . However, the fundamentals behind nitrite accumulation over nitrate 
denitrification were not well understood , and conflicting reports were observed concerning  the 
impact of COD /N ratio, carbon source type, pH level and/or nitrate/nitr ite concentration on the 
accumulation rate. As a result, robust engineering process control strategies were not identified. 
Therefore research comparing complete and partial processes would be required to understand the 
process kinetics  and microbial diver sity and ultimately contributing to a robust PDN process.  
1.2 Thesis objectives  
Denitrification from nitrite is a new trend, with still many challenges to overcome to achieve nitrite 
shunt and partial denitrification . Nitrite ion is very toxic to microorganisms, which requires careful 
control of the kinetic and operation parameters, a nd microorganisms require appropriate time to 
acclimatize to the electron donor (carbon source). Extensive research has been conducted on full 
denitrification from nitrate (FDN) to determine the optimum parameters; however, not much work 
has been conducted  on denitrification from nitrite as the starting electron acceptor. Furthermore, 
partial denitrification from nitrate to nitrite (PDN) is a new trend. The following are the specific 
thesis objectives:  3 
 1. Investigating the effect of COD/N ratio on specific nitrite denitrification rate when the 
carbon source is municipal wastewater and studying the kinetic parameters as well as 
mode lling a relation ship between carbon source consumption rate to nitrite removal rate.  
2. Exploring the long -term effect of methanol u sage as a complementary carbon source on 
the specific denitrification rate and nitrite denitrification kinetics parameters for municipal 
wastewater and their economic value.  
3. Comparing the long -term specific denitrification rate ( SDNR ) for nitrite and nitra te at 
lower COD/N ratio with acetate as a carbon source  and characterizing kinetic parameters 
and microbial structure during complete versus partial denitrification of nitrite . 
1.3 Thesis organization  
The thesis is organized in article -integrated format , and thesis -chapters are presented below:  
Chapter 1 includes a background of denitrification from nitrate, nitrite and partial denitrification. 
Research objectives are also included.  
Chapter 2 is a literature review that includes the fundamental background of denitrification from 
nitrate and nitrite. The chapter also presents the operational and inhibition parameter , which affect 
the denitrification process.  
Chapter 3 presents a research article named “Effect of COD/N ratio on denitrification fro m nitrite”  
A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) operated and continuously fed with primary effluent and nitrite. 
Influent MWW characteristics varied significantly during the study , i.e. 200 -810 mgCOD/L and 
6-80 mgN/L. The SDNR from the SBR were compared with t hose determined in four batch 
reactors using acetate. The SDNR was directly related to COD/N, relationships of SDNR with 
COD/N and F/M ratios were developed, and the kinetic parameters including biomass y ield 
coefficients were determined.  
Chapter 4 presents a research article named “ Denitrification of nitrite using methanol as a 
complementary carbon source .” An SBR fed with primary effluent and methanol as 
complementary carbon source, and nitrite solution was operated at an HRT of 8.4 hrs and SRT of 
16-17 days for 110 days. The SDNR from the SBR was compared with those determined in 23 4 
 batch reactors employing MWW, methanol, nitrite, and nitrate. A study of cost analysis for using 
methanol as a complementar y carbon source with nitrite was also conducted.  
Chapter 5 presents a research article named “ Effect of low COD/N ratio on denitrification from 
nitrite and nitrate : the case for complete versus partial nitrite denitrification .” Two SBRs were 
operated for 126 days, SBR1 fed with nitrite and acetate and SBR2 fed with nitrate and acetate . 
Impact of process operating conditions such as C OD/N ratio and DO level, nitrate and nitrite 
SDNRs and microbial yields were characterized from the longe term s tudy. The specific 
denitrification rate from nitrite ( SDNR NO2), nitrate ( SDNR NO3) and nitrite accumulation rate 
(NAR) were studied at various COD/N ratio s based on cyclic tests  and t he optimum operation 
condition for PDN was identified.  The t axonomic analy sis w as also conducted to compare 
microbial structure in a nitrite versus partial nitrate denitrifying reactor . 
Chapter 6 includes summaries conclusions and future research recommendations.

Literature Review  
2.1 Introduction  
Discharging nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in rivers or lakes can cause eutrophication, 
which clogs water mains, decomposes and causes dissolved oxygen depletion, and kills aquatic 
life. In addition, nitrogen compounds can have deleterious effects on hu man health. The primary 
health hazard from drinking water containing nitrate/nitrite -nitrogen is when nitrite exists in the 
human digestive system, or nitrate is reduced to nitrite during digestion. Generally, nitrite oxidizes 
iron, which is the main compo nent of hemoglobin of the red blood cells, forming a condition called 
methemoglobin. This creates a condition known as " blue baby syndrome," in which blood cannot  
carry sufficient oxygen to the individual body cells causing the veins and skin to appear bl ue. Due 
to this health hazard, EPA  (2009 ) stipulated that the maximum level of nitrate and nitrite should 
not exceed 10 mg/L and 1 mg/L, respectively in any wastewater discharged, and TP of 1 mg /L 
(EPA, 2009), . On the other hand, Constantine (2008 ) reported chronic and acute toxicity limits of 
ammonia a s 0.02 and 0.1 mgNH 4+/L, respectively. Therefore, the removal of nitrogen compounds 
from wastewater is essential.  
Nitrogen in raw wastewater is mostly in the form of ammonia and organic nitroge n. In wastewater 
treatment plants majority of the nitrogen is removed by biological treatment and some by physical 
treatment. Typical nitrogen removing wastewater treatment plants employ first -generation 
nitrification and denitrification processes. X. Yang et al., 2012  reported that in biological 
denitrification, oxidized nitrogen compounds (nitrate and n itrite) are utilized as electron acceptors 
by a wide range of heterotrophic bacteria for their metabolic activity, and release nitrogen gas, 
which is harmless to the human health. This process is accompanied by the removal of organic 
carbon, which acts as an electron donor and carbon source. As denitrification occurs under anoxic 
conditions, the process is affected by various parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO), type and 
availability of organic carbon, COD -to-nitrogen ratio, temperature, and pH. Most a dvances in 
nitrogen removal processes include the use of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) 
bacteria and forming either a combined partial nitritation -anammox (PNA) or partial 7 
 denitrification -anammox (PDN -anammox) process for total nitrogen removal (Schmidt et al., 
2003) .  
2.1.1 First -generation total nitr ogen removal processes   
The first generation nitrogen removal processes involve the conventional nitrification -
denitrification pathway. There are many types of process configurations that are currently used for 
total nitrogen removal based on the nitrifica tion-denitrification pathway. The most common 
include the original Ludzac -Ettinger, the Modified Ludzac -Ettinger (MLE) and Bardenpho 
configurations (Eddy et al., 2014) . The MLE configuration consisted of a pre -anoxic denitr ification 
reactor followed by an aerobic  reactor. The process involves nitrification in the aerobic zone and 
recycling the nitrate that is produced in the aerobic zone to the anoxic zone where denitrification 
occurs. The MLE differs from the original Ludzac -Ettinger configuration, where the deni trification 
(anoxic)  reactor is located post the aerobic reactor, often referred to as post -denitrification. In 
most post -denitrification configurations, the external carbon source is added to the anoxic zone to 
compensate for the carbon source that is al ready utilized (oxidized) in the aerobic zone. The most 
effective TN removal configuration is the Bardenpho that combines pre anoxic, aeration, post 
anoxic, and secondary aerobic zones with internal recirculation from the first oxic zone to the first 
anoxi c zone, while denitrification in the second anoxic zone mainly  relies on the carbon source 
released during endogenous respiration.  
Carousel ditch is yet another process where simultaneous nitrification -denitrification (SND) 
occurs within the bio -floc at lo w DO (Eddy et al., 2014) , with floc size ranges 80 -100 µm. Figure 
2-1 shows that autotrophic bacteria ( ammonia -oxidizing and nitrite -oxidizing bacteria ) grow  on 
the activated sludge surface, while denitrifiers grow  inside the bio -floc. This process is possible 
due to the dissolved oxygen gradient from outside (high DO, aerobic zone) to the inside (low DO) 
of the floc (anoxic zone).  8 
  
Figure 2. 1 Schematic diagram of simultaneous nitrification -denitrification (SND), (S.-P. Sun et 
al., 2009 ) 
 
In conventional nitrification -denitrification processes, ammonia is nitrified to NO 2-N, and then it 
is oxidi zed to NO 3-N by autotrophic microorganisms (Figure 2 -1). After that, the NO 3-N (electron 
acceptor) gets biologically reduced (denitrified) to nitrogen gas in the absence of dissolved oxygen  
by denitrifying heterotrophic bacteria (DNHB). Thus the NO 2-N and NO 3-N along with organic 
carbon (electron d onor) removed in the anoxic environment (Capodaglio et al., 2016) . The 
following is the denitrification stoichiometric bioreaction (equation 2-1) using acetate as a carbon 
source and ammonia as a nitroge n source (mole based):  
1.0 NO3−+1.0 H++ 1.45 CH3COO−+0.33 NH4+=N2+0.33 C5H7NO2+ 1.12 HCO3−+
1.62 H2O+0.13C O2                                                                                                                  (2-1) 
According to the above equation 2-1, the amount of acetate required is 6.5 g COD per g NO 3-N, 
the biomass produced is 0.4 g VSS per g of COD (2.67 g VSS/g N O3-N), and the alkalinity 
produced is 3.57 g CaCO 3 per g of NO 3-N removed. A schematic diagram of the nitrogen cycle as 
it occurs in activated sludge treatment is shown in Figure 2 -2. The figure includes nitrogen 
assimilation and dissimilation pathways. Se veral parameters should be controlled to achieve full 
nitrification (NH 4 to NO 3-) or partial nitrification (NH 4 to NO 2-). For full nitrification, a  minimum 
9 
 bioreactor operating DO of 0.5 -1.0 mg/L, pH of 7.8 -8.2 and minimum alkalinity of 7.14 mg 
alkalinity as CaCO 3 / mg N oxidized is required.  Similarly, for denitrification (NO 2- to N 2), 
operating parameters including lower DO (< 0.5 mg/L) and internal and/or external carbon sources 
should be maintained.

2.1.2 Second generation total nitrogen (TN) removal processes   
The current research trend in TN removal is towards second -generation processes, which are 
configured based on partial nitrifica tion or partial denitrification pathway.  Processes under this 
category include the nitrite shunt, the partial nitrification -anammox, and the partial denitrification -
anammox process es. Compared to the first -generation processes, the second generation proce sses 
are considered sustainable requiring limited aeration input, limited or no organic carbon 
requirement leaving the carbon for recovery, and minimal waste sludge generation.  However, the 
full-scale application of these processes for mainstream wastewat er has not yet been implemented.  
In the nitrite shunt process, ammonia is first nitrified to nitrite according to the stoichiometric 
equation (Equation 2-4, Table 2 -1) and then denitrified according to equation 2-4 (Table 2 -1).  The 
fundamental advantages of nitrite shunt over the traditional nitrification/denitrification include 
25% lower oxygen demand and 40% less external carbon source (estimated based on Equation 2-

 4, Table 2 -1).  The only drawback of denitrification from nitrite so far is nitrite toxic ity to the 
microorganisms and the limited bio diversity of the microbial community (Simon & Klotz, 2013; 
Sun et al., 2009 ).  
The PNA -anammox process started to take researchers' interests 20 years ago; the process saves 
62.5% of oxygen, 90% of external carbon source, and substantial reduction in the sludge 
production. Approximately 50% of the ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite (which acts as an 
electron acceptor) , which reacts biologically with the remaining 50% of ammonia to produce 
nitrogen gas (Equation 2-4, Table 2 -1), by anammox bacteria according to the anammox 
stoichiometric equation shown below  (equation 2-2): 
1.0 NH4++1.32N O2−+0.066  HCO3−+0.13H+=1.02N2+0.26N O3−+0.33 CH2O0.5N0.15+
 2.03 H2O                                                                                                                                     (2-2) 
It can be observed from the above equation that each mole of ammonia oxidized, o ne mole of 
nitrite reduced, and 0.26 mole of nitrate produced. The anammox bacteria are autotrophs and 
utilize carbon dioxide or alkalinity for their cell growth. Certain conditions are needed to partially 
nitrify to nitrite (Equation 2-4, Table 2 -1); thes e conditions include pH, temperature, dissolved 
oxygen, sludge age, free ammonia concentration, and nitrous acid concentration . Park et al., 2010  
has combined these parameters in one contour -graph at a specific temperature in order to 
accumulate nitrite by allowing the ammonia -oxidizing bacteria (AOB) to grow and the nitrite -
oxidizing bacteria (NOB) to washout. The partial nitrification -anammox proc ess has been 
successfully implemented in full -scale to treat ammonia -rich streams (the sidestream wastewater). 
Current full -scale installations use various reactor configurations, including granular sludge 
sequential batch reactor (single sludge), Sharon -anammox (two sludge), suspended granular 
sludge anammox (single sludge) and moving bed bioreactor (single sludge). To date, the PNA 
process is not implemented for mainstream wastewater treatment. Demonstrating a robust PNA 
process has been a challenge due t o the inherent mainstream wastewater treatment conditions, 
which favour nitrite -oxidizing bacteria domination  over anammox bacteria for nitrite. Due to this 
limitation, current research has been shifted to the partial denitrification anammox (PDNA) 
process . In partial denitrification, ammonia is allowed to be nitrified fully to nitrate (equations 2-
4 and 1-5, Table 2 -1), then partially denitrified to nitrite at a condition that maximizes nitrite 
accumulation. The process saves 45% oxygen (aeration energy) a nd 79% of the external carbon 11 
 source. The main advantage of PDN -anammox over the PNA -anammox is that it does not need as 
much control to wash out NOB s. The following stoichiometric equation  (equation  2-3) shows the 
partial denitrification reaction from nit rate (Du, 2019) : 
1.32 NO 3-+ 0.55 CH 3COO- +0.088 NH 4+ = 1.32 NO 2- + 0.088 C 5H7NO 2 + 0.66 HCO 3- + 0.198 H+

2.1.3 Denitrification process fundamentals  
The complete heterotrophic denitrification process consists of sequential reductive reactions from 
nitrate NO 3-  to nitrite NO 2-, nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N 2O), and finally to nitrogen gas 
(N2). The process involves four different enzymes responsible for denitrification reduction: nitrate 
reductase (Nar), nitrite reductase (NiR), NO reductase (NoR), and N 2O reductase (NoS) (Pan, Ni, 12 
 & Yuan, 2013) . These enzymatic reduction reactions are shown in the following enzymatic 
reaction sequence (H. Sun et al., 2009) : 
 NO3--N  NaR       NO 2--N     NiR         NO-N      NoR      N2O-N      NoS        N2                                 
NO 2-, NO, and N 2O are obligate intermediates of heterotrophic denitrification. Under typical 
denitrifying conditions found in a biological wastewater treatment process, NO and N 2O 
reductases have higher maximum nitrogen turnover than NO 3- and NO 2- reductases (Law et al., 
2012)  observed that the maximum N 2O reduction rate is almost four times faster than th e NO 3- and 
NO 2- reduction rate. It is generally considered that the nitrogen reduction rate decreases as the 
oxidation state increases. As such nitrite reduction rate is fast er than nitrate, the nitric oxide 
reduction rate is faster than nitrite, and nitrous oxide reduction rate is faster than nitric oxide, 
implying that during denitrification to nitrogen gas , no accumulation of the intermediates occurs. 
Pan et al., 2012  found that the maximum specific denitrification rates (SDNR) for NO 3-, NO 2-, 
N2O are 45 (pH=7.0), 86 (pH=7.5), 340 (pH=8.0) mg N/g VSS -hr, respectively.  
Some general properties of the biologically relevant nitrogen compounds, which reflect toxicity 
levels to microorganisms and their chemical properties, are listed in Table 2 -2. Nitrogen -based 
catabolism, including properties of respiration as well as detoxi fication of harmful nitrogen 
transformers and enzymes ("reactive nitrogen species"), were explained by Simon & Klotz, 2013 . 
There are detrimental effects of these by -products to the environment. For example, nitric oxide 
(NO) has a toxic effect on bacteria, and nitrous oxide (N 2O) is one of the major greenhouse gases 
that cause ozone depletion. N 2O is increasing globally at an alarming rate of 0.31% per year (Pan, 
Ni, & Yuan, 2013)  and has a radiative effect of 300 times stronger than carbon dioxide.  
Many factors such as external and internal carbon amount and type (COD/N), electron acceptor 
type (NO 3-/NO 2-/NO/N 2O), pH, alkalinity, temperature, and DO concentration affect 
denitrification. Carbon limitation has been widely reported as a condition leading to incomplete 
denitrification (Ginige et al., 2009) . In wastewater treatment plants, carbon originates mostly from 
the influent wastewater. The availability of carbon so urces compared with nitrate/nitrite is often 
expressed as the COD (chemical oxygen demand) or BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) to N 
ratio (COD/N, BOD/N) (Eddy et al., 2014) . The COD/N ratio should be  four to achieve a high 
level of nitrogen removal from nitrate ( estimated from Equations 2-6 and 2-7, Table 2 -1) and  13 
 three from nitrite (Equation 2-7, Table 2 -1). However, there is often an inadequate quantity of 
carbon in the influent wastewater for full denitrification in the treatment plants.

 Previous studies have monitored greenhouse gas emissions such as NO or N 2O in denitrifying 
bioreactors that are operated under lower organic carbon to nitrogen ratios . Pan, Ni, & Yuan, 2013  
reported this ratio as 1.5 or less, as this ratio was not sufficient for denitrification. A previous study 
by (Pan, Ni, & Yuan, 2013) , who  also mentioned that 20% of N 2O was accumulated during 
denitrification with methanol as a carbon source and 40% accumulated during the endogenous 
denitrification phase (pH 6.0), while no accumulation of N 2O with methanol and 30% 
accumulation in endogenous phase at pH 6.5. Hanaki et al.  (1992) observed that 10% of N 2O 
emissions at the same COD/N (1.5) when acetate was used as a carbon source, 20 to 30% of the 
nitrogen load was emitted as N 2O at COD/N ratios below 3.5, accompanied by nitrite 
accumulation. Kishida et al., 2004  observed that the N 2O emission rate at a BOD 5/N ratio (five -
day BOD to N ratio) of 2.6 was 270 times higher than that at a BOD 5/N ratio of 4.5 in swine 
wastewater. Alternatively, denitrification from nitrite with an external carbon source in the pre - 
and post -anoxic bioreactors do not seem to produce these in termediates, which needs further 
investigation.  
 
2.2 Microbiology and kinetics in denitrification  
2.2.1 Heterotrophic -denitrifiers and enzymatic reactions  
Microbial community and structure and the associated specialized enzymes play an essential role 
in the biological treatment. The most common denitrifiers are heterotrophic bacteria. H. Sun et al., 
2009  summarized the characteristics of denitrifying species (Table 2 -3). There are specialized 
microbes that degrade specific organic carbon sources such as methanotrophs  that consume 
methane as electron donor and nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptor (He et al., 2015) , and 
methylotrophs  that consume methanol (Cherchi et al., 2008) , Sacc haribacteria for glucose (Yan 
et al., 2019) . Moreover, some genera are more specialized for electron acceptor type, such as 
zoogloea  for nitrite (Chai et al., 2019) .

Ruiz et al ., 2006  have concluded in their research using the up -flow sludge blanket reactor (USB) 
technology that nitrite accumulation can occur during nitrification at dissolved oxygen (DO) 
concentration of 1 mg /L. They also examined the acclimatization  period of the denitrifying 
microorganisms. In this case, denitrifiers that  were previously  adapted to a lower  nitrite 
concentration  can be acclimatized to a high nitrite feed as long as the nitrite concentration remains 
low inside the reactor. Pishgar et al., 2019  studied the dynamicity of microbial structure for nitrite 
and nitrate denitrification in two up -flow anaerobic/oxic/anoxic/oxic granular SBRs (18 L each, 
4-hr-cycle, 6.7 -HRT).   The authors divided denitrifiers into four groups (Table 2 -4): (i) complete 
aerobic denitrifiers: Dokdonella, Flavobacterium, and Accumulibacter ; (ii) complete anoxic 
denitrifiers: Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Arcobacter, and Comamonas ; (iii) incomplete nit rite 
denitrifier: Diaphorobacter (aerobic/anoxic) and  (iv) incomplete nitrate denitrifiers: Thauera  
(aerobic/anoxic) and Zoogloea  (strictly -aerobic). A more detailed literature regarding  the 
microbial community is presented in Chapter 5.   16

2.2.2 Denitrifier  kinetics: SDNR and Half saturation coefficient  
Specific denitrification rate (SDNR, mgN/mgVSS -d) is the removal of nitrite or nitrate as N 
concentration normalized to the time (mgN/L.d) and divided by the biomass concentration as 
(mgVSS/L). Knowing the SDNR allows sizing the denitrification bioreactor; however, other 
factors affect SDNR. Half saturation concentration (Ks) is the concentration at which specific 
growth rate and SDNR is 50% of the maximum specific growth rate (µ max, 1/d). The maximum 
SDNR c an be determined at the lab by conducting kinetic batch experiments in the absence of 
oxygen  using  excess  carbon source concentration to avoid interference between K N and K COD 
(Equation s 2-10 through 2 -12 and Table 2 -5), and a pH between 7 -8 ( low pH ma y induce nitrous 
acid inhibition ).

Dissolved oxygen with small concentration (0.1 - 0.2 mg/l) can inhibit the enzymatic reduction of 
nitrate and nitrite in the denitrification process, as shown below (Eddy et al., 2014) :

Where SDNR is specific denitrification rate from nitrate  or nitrite  (mg N/mgVSS -hr), 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the 
maximum specific growth rate of heterotrophic -denitrifiers (1/hr), Y h is the yield coefficient for 
heterotrophs for specific carbon source (for methanol Y h= 0.18 to 0.2 mg VSS cells produced 
/COD removed ), Ks is substrate utilization half-saturation  coefficient  (mg/L) , Ss is the carbon 
source (methanol, ethanol, acetate, and  glycerol)  concentration in mg/L , SNO3 is the concentration 
of nitrate (mg/l), K NO3 is the half -saturation concentration of nitrate  in mg/L , 𝐾𝑜′ is the inhibiting 
DO concentration (ranges between 0.1 to 0.2 mg/L for nitrate), 𝜂 is the fraction of biomass able to 
degrade the external carbon with nitrate reduction, X h is the biomass concentration in the mixed 
liquor suspended solids (mg/L ), and X vss is the concentration of volatile m ixed liquor suspended 
solids (mg/L).  
 18 
 A similar equation can be applied to determine the SDNR from nitrite with the modification of a 
stoichiometric coefficient of 2.86 by 1.72 , while the coefficient is 1.14 for partial denitrification. 
Moreover, the DO in hibition coefficient 𝐾𝑜′ is only reported for denitrification from nitrate. To the 
best of our knowledge, no values were reported when denitrification occurred from nitrite, also 
under the partial denitrification condition. Furthermore, not many studies were conducted to 
determin e kinetic parameters such as 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥, K NO2, and Ɵ (Arrhenius coefficient) for 
denitrification from nitrite with an external  and internal  carbon source. Dosta et al., 2007  reported 
KNO2 and  KNO3 concentrations  (half -saturation constant for nitrite and nitrate) of 0.9 and 1.5 
mgN/L, respectively. Kornaros et al., 1996  reported these values as 0.28 mg NO 2--N/L and 0.77 
mg NO 3--N/L with L -glutamic acid as carbon source. Therefore, nitrite has higher denitrification 
rates when both nitrite and nitrate have a similar concentration (Pan et al., 2012) .  
Eddy et al. , 2014  reported simplified equations to calculate SDNR for denitrification from nitrate 
with methanol and ethanol as an external carbon source with different Arrhenius coefficients. 
These rates can be amended for denitrification from nitrite.  
For methan ol: SDNR= 0.0738 (1.11) T-20                                                                                                                            (2-13) 
For ethanol: SDNR= 0.161 (1.13) T-20                                                                                                                                   (2-14) 
However, these equations cannot be used in the design of pre -anoxic zones where external carbon 
source is added as a complementary carbon source, in addition to the influent wastewater main 
carbon source. In case of the pre -anoxic denitrification zone, Eddy et al., 2 014 recommend ed the 
use of the following equations to calculate SDNR:  
SDNR 20 = (F/M) (F b/0.3) + 0.029                                                                                              (2-15)

Where : (i) SDNR (specific denitrification rate at 200C in g  NO 3--N/g MLVSS -d), (ii) F/M is g

VSS/g VSS -d, (v) Fb is the active biomass fraction, and (vi) Yi is the inverse VSS fraction of non -
biodegrada ble g  nbVSS/g COD (0.1 -0.3 for secondary treatment with primary treatment, and 0.3 -
0.5 without primary treatment).  19 
 2.2.3 Denitrifier kinetics: Denitrifiers yield  
The yield coefficient Y HD is defined as the amount of biomass produced divided by the COD 
removed (mgVSS produced /COD removed ). The VSS produced  can also be presented as COD of the biomass 
produced  multiplying by 1.42 (1.42 mgCOD/mgVSS), it can also be calculated in relation to N 
removed (mg  VSS produced /mg Nremoved ) (Eddy et al., 2014) . The relation between Y, SDNR, and 
µmax is Y N = µ max/SDNR. The relation between Y N and Y HD can be calculated as per the following 
equation:  
YN=1−1.42Y 𝐻𝐷
ST  Y𝐻𝐷                                                                                                                          (2-17) 
Many factors  affect the yield coefficient, such as carbon source type and an electron acceptor 
(oxygen, nitrate, nitrite), as sh own in Table 2 -6. Friso n et al., 2013  estimated the total consumption 
of COD per gram of nitrite converted to nitrogen gas as 1.72, which is obtained from half -reaction 
(Eddy et al., 2014)  and equivalent to 2.86 for nitrate, 1.72 for nitrite and 1.14 for partial 
denitrification (deni trification from nitrate to nitrite); hence, the heterotrophic sludge yield can be 
calculated as follows:  
YHD(NO3 −N2)=1− 2.86 NO2 −Nreduced
CODconsumed                                                                                      (2-18) 
YHD(NO2 −N2)=1− 1.72 NO2 −Nreduced
CODconsumed                                                                                       (2-19) 
YHD(NO3 −NO2 )=1− 1.14 NO2 −Nreduced
CODconsumed                                                                                     (2-20) 
Where Y HD is the yield coefficient for anoxic heterotrophs (g COD cells produced/g COD 
removed), Frison et al., 2013  also estimated the Y HD for acetic acid and glycerol 2.1 and 2.3, 
respectively.

2.3 Denitrification from nitrite   
During a nitrite shunt process , ammonia is first oxidized to nitrite by ammonia -oxidizing bacteria 
(AOB) ; nitrite is then consumed by heterotrophic denitrifiers in an anoxic environment as an 
electron acceptor with an organic carbon source (electron donor) such as methanol , ethanol, 
acetate, glycerol and glucose. The process requires the competitive advantage of denitrifying 
bacteria over nitrite -oxidizing bacteria (NOB). The advantages of the process include: (i) 25% 
process air reduction, (ii) 40% external carbon saving, (iii) reduced biological sludge production , 
which intern reduces sludge treatment equipment sizes (Figure 2 -3), (Bilyk et al., 2011) ) and (iv) 
an overall reduction of aerobic and anoxic bioreactor size and the footprint. However, the process 
has challenges during the first partial ammonia nitrification to nitrite step and also during the 
subsequent denitrification from nitrite step, th e latter associated with nitrite toxicity to the 
microorganisms (Ruiz et al., 2006) . Some researches indicated that denitrification from nitrite 
requires certain acclimatization periods under specific operational conditions (Chung & Bae, 
2002) . The nitrite denitrification process is carried out anoxically by a bacteria that induce nitrite 
reductase enzyme (NiR),  mostly in the cytoplasm rather than in periplasm, which limits the 
induction of nitrate reductase enzyme (NaR) (Mellor et al., 1992) . Detailed literature in 
denitrification from nitrite can be found in Chapters 3 and 4 , including a  summary of the literature 
in Table 3 -1. 
 21 
  
Figure 2. 3 Nitrification/Denitrification through nitrite pathway (Ma et al., 2016)  
 
2.3.1 Effect of pH and use of ORP on nitrite -denitrification  process  
The pH and ORP play a vital role during denitrification from nitrite. In this process, alkalinity 
(3.57 mgCaCO 3) is produced during denitrification from nitrite resulting in a pH increase (Eddy 
et al., 2014) . Pan et al., 2012  conducted denitrification from nitrite an d nitrate study in a sequencing 
batch reactor (SBR) (6 hr -cycle) and found that substantial N 2O accumulation occurs at relatively 
lower pH levels of 6.0 to 6.5. The maximum specific nitrate and nitrite reduction rates vary with 
pH, and the highest specific  denitrification rates of 1.08 and 2.06 mg  N/mg  VSS-d occurred at 7.2 
to 7.8 pH, respectively. However, they did not study this effect with various types of external 
carbon sources and COD/N ratios and different pH values.  
S. Ge et al., 2012  examined denitrification from nitrate and the denitrification from the produced 
nitrite on the nitrate denitrification -pathway with various carbon sources (glucose, acetate, 
methanol). The a uthors relied on the use of pH and ORP control strategies. Their study confirmed 
that the alkalinity produced during denitrification is mainly from nitrite denitrification (not from 
nitrate) . Hence t he pH increase is due to OH- produced during denitrificat ion from the nitrite 
denitrification process , as shown in the following denitrification equations: 
3NO3−+CH3OH→3NO2−+2H2O+CO2                                                                                (2-21) 
2NO2−+CH3OH→N2+H2O+CO2+2OH−                                                                        (2-22) 
22 
 Figure 2 -4 variation of ORP, pH and nitrogen concentration with methanol as a carbon source (S. 
Ge et al., 2012) . The study showed  a gradual pH increase during the initial reaction stage. The CO 2 
acidity produced by nitrate reduction is counteracted by alkalinity production followed by 
hydroxide alkalinity generation resulting in a relatively sharp pH increase to the peak pH of 8.5 
point-B (Figure 2.4) . The increase in pH was due to the denitrification of nitrite (Equation 2-22).  
Overall, pH could be chosen as a control parameter during den itrification (e.g. SBR process)  to 
indicate the end of the nitrate or nitrite reduction and the starting point for denitrification from 
nitrite as well as to start the aeration -nitrification. Moreover, the ORP for both denitrification 
phases has two major inflection points, A and B, cor responding to pH values  (Figure 2.4) . They 
also proposed that carbon source addition and denitrification could be controlled by monitoring 
these inflection points in the pH and ORP curves without additional chemical analyses.

During denitrification, electrons are transferred from the organic carbon source (electron donor) 
to the electron acceptor (nitrite) until it reaches the equilibrium. During this process, the oxidation -
reduction potential (ORP) can measure electrons transf erred in m.volt during the process. 
However, because this process is carried out by the bacteria and the surrounding environment, the 
equilibrium conditions will never be reached (Cheng et al., 2012) . In the aerobic process, oxygen 
is the electron acceptor; the ORP reads +ve. In contrast, in the anaerobic or anoxic process, the 
ORP reads -ve, furth er ORP in the biological process will never read zero because the biological 
23 
 reaction is always spontaneous. H. Sun et al., 2009  calculated ORP based on equation 2-23, where 
E0 is the standard oxidation -reduction potential (V), n  is the numbers of transferred electrons, R  is 
the molar gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K), T  is the temperature(K); F  is Faraday constant, 96487 
C/mol, [Red] concentration of the reduced specie s, [Ox] is the concentration of the oxidized 
species.

These equations confirm that the rate of denitrification from nitrite to nitrogen gas is more 
spontaneous ( -277 KJ/mol) than denitrification from nitrate to nitrite ( -82.9KJ/mo l). 
The bioreactor pH also impacts the generation of free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration in a 
denitrifier  reactor.  FNA is one of the most inhibitory parameters in the denitrification reaction, 
and its generation is based on the following equation  (equation 2-26) illustrated by Anthonisen et 
al., 1976 , who reported a minimum concentration of 0.2 mgFNA/L for complete denitrification 
inhibition. Y. Zhou et al., 2011  suggested at the FNA concentration range of 0.01 to 0.025, 40% 
inhibition may occur during denitrification from n itrate, mainly when nitrite ion exists (i.e. 
competition between two -electron acceptor s). Zhou also suggested that at the same levels of FNA,  
a similar level of inhibition might occur when denitrifying from nitrite.  On another note, FNA 
inhibition has no t been reported for domestic wastewater due to the lower nitrite concentration 
(20-30mg/L) and the neutral pH (7.0).

 2.3.2 Denitrification kinetics (yield, half -saturation, growth rate)   
Denitrification kinetics are model input parameters, which describe specific denitrification rates 
(SDNR) according to the Monod model, which allows the design of biological treatment facilities. 
The well defined kinetic parameters are half -saturation conc entration (K NO3 and K NO2, mg N/L), 
maximum specific growth rate (µ max , 1/d) and the yield coeffic ient (mg  VSS/mg  COD or mg  
VSS/mg  N) (Kornaros et al., 1996) .  Karanasios et al.  (2010 ) summarize s these parameters with 
hydrogen as electron donor, as it is shown in Table 2 -7, these kinetic parameters varied widely and 
depends on the operation conditions such as temperature, initial nitrite or nitrate concentrations, 
carbon source type and concentrat ions, and the biomass type and diversity which has the highest 
effect on the SDNR. It is also important to note that the literature values are highly variable owing 
to the difficulty of reproducibility of any kinetic test due to the change of microbial div ersity and 
measurement accuracy.  There is minimal  literature on yield data of denitrification from nitrite, 
especially with MWW as a carbon source. However, the available literature is for complete 
denitrification from nitrate with external carbon sources  such as acetate: Yalda Mokhayeri et al.  ( 
2008 ), Cherchi et al. (2009) and Zhang et al., (2016)  reported 0.42 , 0.35 amd 0.38  mg VSS/mg  
COD,  respectively.  Peng et al., 2007  estimated the yield of 0.4, 0.42, and 0.65 mgVSS/mgCOD 
for methanol, ethanol, and acetate, respectively. Guven et al., 2018  also reported a yield coefficient 
of 0.45 mgVSS/mgCOD for a mixture of carbon sources (acetate, propionate, ethanol, glucose).  
Similarily limited data is available on half -saturatio n coefficient and µmax for nitrite denitrification. 
For example, Dosta et al., 2007  reported half -saturation coefficients for KNO2 and K NO3 0.9 mg  
NO 2-N/L and 1.4 mg  NO 3-N/L for acetate. Kornaros et al., 1996  found  K NO2 of 0.28 mg NO 2-N/L 
and K NO3 of  0.77 mgNO 3-N/L for L -glutamic acid. On the other hand, Her and Huang ,1995a  
reported K NO2 of 10.9 mg/L and K NO3 of 14.3 mg/L with methanol. The value of µ max for nitrate 
and acetate was found to be 0.5 d-1  by Yalda Mokhayeri et al., 2008 , 1.3 d-1  by Dold et al. 2008 , 
and 1.25 d-1  by Nichols et al., 2007 ..

Additional d etailed literature on yield  can be found in chapter 3 (section 3.3.3.3), chapter 4 
(sections 4.4.3.2, 4.4.4.1 and 4.4.4.2) and chapter 5 (section 5.3.5.1). A further detailed discussion 
of K NO2 and µ max can be also be found in chapter 3 (section 3.3.3.4), chapter 4 (section s 4.3 and  
4.4.3.3) and chapter 5 (section 5.3.5.3). In summary,  these kinetic parameters are an es sential  tool 
for biological denitrification design , and currently, there are not available literature for nitrite . The 
literature review showed that kinetic information is available  for nitrate ; however, even for nitrate 
kinetics, data is limited for  various carbon sources and partial  denitrification . Limitation of 
denitrification kinetics data was identified as a research gap and will be addressed in the present 
study.   
2.3.3 Effect of carbon source type and COD/N Ratio on SDNR  
In addition to an inte rnal carbon source (municipal wastewater -MWW), a range of external carbon 
sources can be used in denitrification such as methanol, acetate, ethanol, glycerol, glucose and 
sugar. Other external carbon sources from organic waste or food waste are also used, including 
MicroC (Cherchi et al., 2008)  and organic fraction of municipal solid water  (Frison et al., 2013) .  
Carbon sources can have various effects on SDNR, microbial biodiversity, yield, Ks (carbon 
source), and maximum specific growth rate. Henze et al., 19 94 classified the carbon source

 metabolized has the highest SDNR, (ii) easily degradable (higher VFA, lower alcohols, lower 
amino acids, simple carbohy drates) and (iii) the second highest, and slowly degradable which 
hydroly zed before becoming readily biodegradable which has the lowest SDNR rate .. 
The biodegradability of municipal wastewater ( MWW ) varies from readily to slowly 
biodegradable organic  carbon such as volatile fatty acids (VFA ), lipids, carbohydrates and 
proteins. Municipal wastewater COD comprises of  various organic carbon source fractions such as 
readily biodegradable (39% of total COD) and slowly biodegradable (23%) organics (Makowska & 
Spychała, 2014 ). Compared to ot her external caron sources, MWW is much less biodegradable 
(Henze et al., 1994) . Acetate can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle  directly . In 
contrast, methanol is used by methylotrophs and converted to glycine through the serine -
glyoxylate pathway, which could induce 3 -4 c intermediates until converted to acetate (Cherchi et 
al., 2008) . When glucose is used as a carbon source, it passed through many steps until it enters 
the TCA cycle. Accordingly, the carbon source utilization rates are different, which in turn affects 
the SDNR and the kinetic parameters. Methanol is the most used external carbon source for 
denitrification in the USA (Theis & Hicks, 2012) . The extra capital safety system cost for methan ol 
was estimated to be in the range of 25% to 31% compared to other non -flammable external carbon 
sources (Cherchi et al., 2008) . Although methanol is most commonly used, due to increasing price 
and shortage of supply, there is a trend to look for cheaper,  safer, and effective alternatives such 
as MicroCTM (Cherchi et al., 2008) .  
Adav et al., 2010  conducted tests to denitrify a high concentration of nitrite (200 mg/l) with 
different types of external carbon sources (acetate, ethanol, and methanol). The highest SDNR was 
obtained for acetate concentration (1500 mg/l): 2.07 mg N/g VSS -hr at a COD aceta te/NO 2—N ratio 
of 8, whereas the highest SDNR for ethanol and methanol at a concentration of 700 mg/L (i.e. 
COD methanol / NO 2-—N ratio of 5.25, and COD ethanol /NO 2-—N of 7.3) were 1.2 and 1.61 mg N/g 
VSS.hr, respectively. The NiR enzyme activities were highe st at the highest denitrification rates 
for the three carbon sources (i.e., 44.2, 39.3, and 34 mM NO2--N/g VSS -hr for acetate, ethanol, 
and methanol, respectively). However, when the ratios increased more than the ratios mentioned 
above  for the three types  of electron donors, SDNR , and enzymatic activities decreased. (Adav et 
al., 2010  mentioned that their study was the first for denitrification from hig h nitrite concentration 
with three external carbon sources. Analyzing the data given by Adav et al., 2010 , we may 27 
 conclude that for high nitrite concentration, at COD/N ratios equal to 5 (maximum economic ratio 
used for domestic wastewater with external carbon source),  SDNR of the three -carbon source are 
equal (1.2 mg N/g VSS -hr, Figure 2 -5). Moreover, the  shape of the three curves in the same figure 
indicate s substrate inhibition because SDNR reaches the maximum and then dropped to a lower 
level at higher COD/N. The same trend also applies to the relationship between the SDNR and 
F/M ratio. We may also con clude from the same study (Figure 2 -6) that enzymatic activity 
increased as COD/N ratio increases up to 11.4 mgN/mgVSS -d at COD/N ratio equal 5 (for 
methanol), and decreased gradually, and leve lling off at enzymatic activity of 3 mgN/mgVSS -d at 
COD/N ratio  of 10. However, enzyme activity for ethanol and acetate was much higher than 
methanol at COD/N ratio of more than 10 (Figure 2 -6), which indicate s the importance of finding 
out the optimum COD/N at which SDNR is maximum.

 There are limited studies on denitrification from nitrite. However, several studies t hat compared 
the impact of carbon source type and COD/N ratio on nitrate denitrification are discussed below.  
Yalda Mokhayeri et al., 2008  have conducted a study on the effect of changing the carbon source 
on the specific denitrification rates from nitrate. In the study mentioned above , they used three 
main batches to acclimatize the sludge on three carbon sources : methanol, ethanol, and acetate.  
Then, they alternated the type of carbon source for the batches with sludge that was acclimatized 
with another carbon source and measured the specific denitrification rate for different cases. Table 
2-8 shows a comparison  of SDNR rates for the different substrates added to each of the grown 
biomass for 24 hours. All experiments were conducted at 13 0C in batch reactors to evaluate SDNR 
for different external carbon sources . As it is known that denitrification with methanol  is more 
sensitive to cold temperature than other carbon sources, therefore, the total sludge age for methanol 
reactor was 26 days, and 14 days for ethanol and acetate. The authors selected a longer sludge age 
for methanol reactor in order to maintain MLSS  in the methanol bioreactor and to prevent sludge 
washout at low temperatures.  Therefore, the anoxic operation parameters condition were: SRT for 
methanol, acetate, and ethanol were 12, 7, and  7 respectively, DO˂0.4 mg/L, pH range 7.4 -7.63, 
the temperatu re 130C, and COD/N (600/100 mg/L)  ratio was 6. As it is clearly seen from the Table 
2-8 that the highest denitrification rates (from nitrate) were 31.7 and 30.4 mg NO 3--N/g VSS -hr, 
respectively, when acetate and ethanol were the carbon sources, while metha nol exhibited the 
lowest rate (9.2 mg NO 3--N/g VSS -hr).  However, acetate acclimatized sludge may take a long 
time to acclimatize to methanol as a carbon source (denitrification rate after 24 hrs is only 0.8 hr-
1). 
Bernat et al., 2008  also reported that acetate could produce the highest denitrification rate, followed 
by methan ol and glucose. Bernat et al., 2008  observed that COD/N requirements in practice should 
be in the range of 5 –10 g COD/ g NO 3-- N and a minimum ratio of 3.5 –4 g COD /g NO 3-- N is 
necessary, and when the influent COD/N ratio is lower than 3.4 g COD /g NO 3--N, extra COD 
should be added to remove residual nitrate. On the other hand, when the influent ratio is higher, a 
short aerobic phase should be introduced after the anoxic phase to remove any additional carbon 
source remaining and to liberate N 2 gas.

Ginige et al., 2009  conducted denitrification experiments using 3 SBR batches, and 4 -hr-
cycles/batch at average SRT of 15 days, where batch one was operated as primary anoxic zone, 
batch two was operated with primary wastewater feed followed by secondary anoxic phase, and 
batch three was used as control (no methanol). Methanol was added to SBR 1 (primary as 
complementary carbon source) and 2 (secondary anoxic), acclimatization period  (3 -6 weeks ) 
(Ginige et al., 2009) . The COD/NO 3-- N ratios for stages 1, 3, and 4 were 62.5/33.1=1.9, 51.5/36.1= 
1.4, and 40.1/33= 1.2, respectively. The aut hors concluded that methanol addition enhances the 
growth of specific methanol -denitrifiers, improving denitrification rates, as the capability of sludge 
to use methanol and ethanol for denitrification is improved, a nd unlike acetate sludge, settle bility 
also improved. On the other hand, methanol reduced the capabilities of denitrifi ers that utilize 
normal wastewater COD (denitrification rate is reduced when the carbon source is wastewater); 
however, a little amount of methanol (low COD/N) could lead to nit rite accumulation . They 
mentioned that the best location for external carbon is in the post anoxic zone, and in small amounts 
as the remaining amount of nitrite/nitrate to be denitrified is small. However, methanol may be 
added to the primary anoxic zone a s a complementary external carbon to adjust COD/N ratio, when 
a small amount is needed as sludge may require acclimatization every time, which is not feasible.  30 
 Timmermans & Van Haute, 1983  studied specific denitrification rates of nitrite produced durin g 
nitrate denitrification  (Table 2 -9). When the nitrite concentration was 9.2 mg/L , and nitrate 
concentration was 55 mg/l, the SDNR of nitrate (0.038 mg N/mg VSS -hr) was half that of nitrite 
(0.077 mg N/mg VSS -hr). Timmermans & Van Haute, 1983  also concluded that when nitrite exists 
in higher concentration s than nitrate, nitrite inhibits nitrate denitrification. However, if nitrate is 
the only electron accept or, normal SDNR from nitrate is obtained. Moreover, the optimum ratio 
of methanol to nitrate for complete denitrification (mg CH 3OH/mg NO 3--N) was 2.52, whereas the 
ratio of methanol to nitrite is 1.8 (Table 2 -9).

Frison et al., 2013  compared denitrification rates for nitrite and nitrate with synthetic digested 
sludge supernatant as a carbon source  (Table 2 -10), which illustrates  various rates for various 
carbon sources . For example , the organic fraction of municipal solids waste  (OFMSW ), the 
fermentation or the drainage liquid ha d a close range of SDNR  (0.51 and 0.65  mgNO 2–N/mgVSS -
day), and their performance in denitrification is 50% of CM&MS (1.16 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d). 
Glycerol showed very low performance (0. 11 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d) compared with acetate (0.603 
mgNO 3-N/mgVSS -d) and acetic acid (1.14 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d). Table 2 -10 also shows that the 
highest SDNRs occurred with nitrite using as acetic acid and CM&MS  (cattle manure  and maize 
silage)  as a carbon source.  31

Frison et al., 2013  conducted a cost analysis to compare different carbon sources for denitrification 
(Table 2 -11). Where OFMSW represents the organic fraction of the mun icipal solid waste, and 
CM&MS represents cattle manure and maize silage (fermentation liquid). Based on methanol 
prices in 2004, F rison et al. (2013)  concluded a 2 2% decrease in overall specific cost when using 
OFMSW fermentation liquid compared to methanol (3.24 -3.64 Euros/kg N removed for methanol, 
and 2.85 Euros/kg N removed for OFMSW fermentation liquid) for denitrification.  
Denitrification rate is primarily go verned by COD/N ratio (Bernat et al., 2008) . Studies on nitrate 
denitrification presented that optimal COD/N rati os were reported (˃ 4.0) (Eddy et al., 2014) . In 
contrast, the effect of carbon source type and COD/N ratio on nitrite denitrification was not 
available in the literature. The possible effect of COD/N ratio includes inhibition of a high dosage 
of carbon to denitri fication. In this study, the effect of COD/N ratio on nitrite SDNR and the 
mechanism behind will be studied using municipal wastewater, methanol and acetate as a carbon 
source by giving emphasis on nitrite concentration that can be found in wastewater.

2.4 Partial denitrification (PDN)  
Partial denitrification is a second -generation TN removal process. It is the second and limiting ste p                
of the nitrification -partial denitrification -anammox (PDNA) process for TN removal. In         
nitrification -PDNA, ammonia is allowed to be nitrified fully to nitrate, then partially denitrified to           
nitrite at a condition that maximizes nitrite accumula tion. The process (Figure 2 -7) saves 45%         
oxygen (aeration energy) and 79 % of the external carbon source (Ma et al., 2016) . The         
nitrification -PDNA process  is currently considered to be the most promising second -generation         
process for mainstream wastewater treatment. The process also can be very successful for          
nitrogen -rich industrial wastewater treatment such as chemical fertilizer wastewater, explosives         
wastewater and other production wastewater (Yang Z hang et al., 2019 ). A summary of previous

In addition to S. Ge et al., 2012  studied the effect of COD/N ratio in a batch reactor for different 
types of electron donors (methanol, acetate, and glucose), on the denitrification rates from nitrate, 
with ratios of 1, 6, 10, 15, 20, and 25 (VSS was 1250 mg/L). They also studied specific nitrite 
accumulation rates (SNAR) during transformation as well as the denitrification rates from nitrite 
and concluded that the initial COD/NO 3--N affected the level of (i) nitrate denitrification rate 
(initial, phase 1), (ii) nitrite denitrification (during nitrate denitrification), (iii) nitrate 
denitrification (phase 2) and (iv) nitrite denitrification (phase 2) and (v) nitrite accumulation during 
denitrification from nitrate. The highest SDNRs were 0.64 ( glucose), 0.35 (acetate), 0.029 
(methanol) and 0.04 mgN/mgVSS -d, respectively. Moreover, the highest accumulation occurred 
with glucose (22.32 mgN/L) at SNAR of 0.34 mgN/mgVSS -d. Ge  et al.  attributed nitrite 
accumulation to the competition between electron  acceptors enzymes (Nir and Nar reductase). 
They also recommended the use of pH and ORP to control the denitrification process (real -time 
control). S. Ge et al., 2012  found two high accumulation points occurred with glucose of 22.32 
and  20.01 mgN/L at COD/N of 15 and 10, respectively  (table 2 -12). Whereas the maximum nitrite 
accumulated with methanol was 19.34 mgN/L at COD/N of 25. Acetate was found to cause the 
lowest -highest accumulation among the three carbon sources with nitrite accumulation of 17 
mgN/L at COD/N of 25. It can be concluded from Table 2 -13  the highest nitrite accumulation 
occurred at the highest SNAR of 0.34 mgN/mgVSS -d.

Shi et al., 2019  studied the effect of pH (adjusted to 9) on achieving partial denitrification (PDN) 
in a 6 L anoxic -sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR, sponge carrier media,), the cycles  were 
varied started with 6 hr -cycle (116 days) and then reduced to 2hr -cycle. However, the authors use 
3 reaction times (5 hrs and 3hrs -period 1, 1 hr -period 2, no settling), the nitrate feed and diluted 
MWW -COD (205 mgCOD/L before dilution) feed were 30m gN/L and 145 mgCOD/L, 
respectively, and the COD/N ranged between 4 -6  and DO≤0.1 mg/L. The results showed a high 
nitrite accumulation of nitrite 23.5 and 25.2 at H of 7 and 9, respectively, implying that there is no 
effectct of COD/N ratio and pH on PDN. H owever, in batch tests with acetate carbon source Shi 
found a higher accumulation at pH 9 than pH 7 with nitrite accumulation percentage and 
concentrations of (90.3%, 22.5 mgN/L) and (91.8%, 22), respectively. In the same study, Shi found 
that the maximum nitrite accumulated reached after 60 minutes in day after day 126 while before 
that day the was reached after 180 minutes, implying long term operation improve the microbial 
structure to carry out nitrite accumulation in a shorter period. However, he concl uded possible 
optimum COD/N ratio    6.2, which is higher than previously believed ratio of 3 (Cui et al., 2017) . 
Shi finally found that thauera has the highest relative abundance (21.9%), followed by 
Flavobacterium  (9.6%) and Thiobacillus  (6.3%).  35 
  
Yang Zhang et al., 2019 . also investigated partial denitrification  (COD of 100mg/L, acetate) at 
COD/N of 3, 5 and 7 with cultured Acinetobacter Johnsonii  , the maximum nitrite accumulation 
were 80.9%, 94.2 and 87.4%, respectively, and occurred after 13 hours from the experiment which 
indicating the optimum COD/N of 4 -5 is the optimum. However, Zhang  et al.  illustrated that NaR 
is less competitive than NiR when COD/N is low (less than 3), and when COD/N increases the 
gene level of napA , which is located in the periplasm,  increases and the denitrification from nitrate 
become much higher than nitrite. This imply that the nitrite and nitrate reductase enzymes 
availability as well as the COD/N ratio plays an importat role in nitrite and nitrate denitrification 
rates, and partial denitrification. He also found that there is no major pH effect on the PDN in the 
rang of 6 -9. 
 
Xiujie et al., 2019  studied partial denitrification with glucose in 3 SBRs (6 hrs cycle, 2cycle/d), 
the nitrite accumulated in SBR1 (anoxic) was 8.29 mgN/L , 9.94 mgN/L in SBR2 (aerobic -anoxic), 
11.63 mgN/L in SBR3 (low DO)  and at COD/N of 3 (30 mgNO3 -N/L), and the denitrifica tion 
rates from nitrate and nitrite were 17.24 mgN/L -hr and 3.38 mgN/L -hr in SBR1, 10.16 mgN/L -hr 
and 1.72 mgN/L -hr in SBR2 and 7.98 mgN/L -hr and 0.8 mgN/L -hr in SBR3, respectively, for the 
first 2.5 hr of the reaction and then reduced to 0.52 mgN/L -hr and  0.9 mgN/L -hr (2.5 -8 hrs) for 
nitrate and nitrite, respectively. These results imply that nitrate reductase is more affected by 
carbon source deficiency than nitrite, whereas when carbon source available, the nitrate reductase 
activity is much higher than nitrite activity. Further explanation by Xiujie that the biomass in SBR1 
has higher denitrification ability than SBR2 and SBR3 and nitrite reductase is more sensitive to 
DO than nitrate reductase, which causes nitrite accumulation. He also detected various  phyla, and 
they are arranged from the highest to the lowest relative abundance Proteobacteria (44%)  in 
SBR1 , Bacteroidetes (19%) in SBR3 , Acidobacteria (12.9%) , Planctomycetes, Candidatus 
saccharibacteria, Chloro fexi). In the genus level  Saccharibacteria , which is related to glucose, 
with a relative abundance of  5.35% in SBR1, 45.44% in SBR2, and 34.96% in SBR3. The relative 
abundance in SBR2 and SBR3 is related to the favourability of Saccharibacteria  to DO. Other 
genera that was found and arranged acco rding to relative abundance are Aridibacter, 
Pseudomonas, Thauera, Gemmobacter and Citrobacter, implying that the relative abundance of 
the genera are related to the carbon source (glucose).  36 
  
In a study by Du et  al., 2017  in SBR followed UASB, the SDNR NO3 -NO2 and SDNR NO2 with acetate 
were 0.47 and 0.42 mgN/mgVSS -d, respectively, whereas SDNR NO3 -NO2 and SDNR NO2 with 
ethanol were 0.29 and 0.2 mgN/mgVSS -d.  However, Le et al., 2019 a and Le et al., 2019 b were  
not able to accumulate nitrite with methanol, illustrating two elucidation for PDN which are 1 - 
acetate and glycerol can enter directly to TCA cycle and stored in the cell in the form of poly‐3‐
hydroxybutyrate and then utilized as an electron donor during  denitrification. A large pool of 
electrons is released within the cell during denitrification. While NaR has a higher electron 
capacity (2 e-/mole -nitrate) than NiR (e-/mole -nitrite) , NaR could react with more electrons, which 
creates a  much higher reduction rate than NiR reaction rate.  The other explanation 2 - when acetate 
or glycerol are used, NaR reacts with the electrons in the cytochrome b, which is located in the 
upstream region of the cytoplasm. At the same time, NiR accepts elec trons from cytochrome c 
located in the downstream region. Acetate and glycerol donate electrons in the upstream region 
(cytoplasm b) which allow nitrite to accumulate, whereas methanol donate electrons in the down 
stream region which nitrite is not accumul ated with methanol.  
 
Moreover,  Le et al., 2019 a and Le et al., 2019 b in the partial denitrification study (PDN -anammox) 
accumulated more than 80 % nitrite at COD/N ratio of 2 -3, and nitrite started to be denitrified when 
nitrate concentration was below 3 mgN/L. However, they did not consider denitrification from 
nitrite (partial nitrification/denitrification) to measure specific denitrification rat es from nitrite in 
relation to COD/N ratios. To do so , an acclimatization step is required for denitrifies (denitrifying -
bacteria and heterotrophs) with nitrite as an electron acceptor. Nitrite with a higher toxicity effect 
on the microbes than nitrate req uires longer acclimatization time. Table 2 -12 shows denitrification 
rates from accumulated nitrite with different carbon sources. It is clear that in the first phase of 
SDNR, acetate exhibited the highest denitrification rate from nitrate (0.35 d-1), while the 
denitrification rate from nitrite was highest with methanol in the second phase (0.041 d-1).    
In conclusion, several early -stage trials to investigate partial denitrification  (PDN) (Table5 -1, 
chapter 5) are in the research process ; the study in chapter 5 shows PDN -trials through the control 
of COD/N, final nitrate concentration, high pH , and high DO parameters. However, until now , 
these parameters do not show they govern the PDN process since various researchers selected 
different COD/N with a wide gap. Controls such as increas ing the pH will not make any difference 37 
 since pH typic ally increases with al kalinity during denitrification; however,  increasing DO will be 
very critical since nitrite may convert again to nitrate . The control through the  effluent nitrate 
concentration wa s not proven because the effluent nitrate concentration varies with the carbon 
source and is also directly related to K NO3. Most of the recent  researches combine PDN -anammox 
in one reactor , which did not analyze nitrite accumulation but anammox activi ty. Finally, n one of 
the previous research studied the partial denitrification  mechanism and compared nitrite and nitrate 
denitrifying biomass str ucture (type and biodiversity) and critical ly analy ze the  partial 
denit rification kinetics.  
2.5 Research knowledge gaps  
Nitrite shunt and partial denitrification processes are new trends in the TN removal process from 
municipal wastewater. Nitrite ion is very toxic to microorganisms, which requires careful control 
of the kine tic and operation parameters, and microorganisms require a long time to acclimatize to 
the electron donor. Extensive research has been conducted on denitrification from nitrate to 
determine the optimum parameters; however, not much work has been conducted on denitrification 
from nitrite as the starting electron acceptor. The following are some specific knowledge gaps that 
were found in the existing literature, which will be addressed in the present work:  
1. Review of the literature showed the electron distribu tion among the four types of nitrogen 
oxide (NO 3-/NO 2-/NO/N 2O) with methanol as electron donor, but the effect of internal 
carbon source (municipal wastewater) on the denitrification rates was not considered, 
which will provide better expectation in the de sign of biological nitrogen removal in 
wastewater treatment plants  (Eddy et al., 2014) . Thus, the optimum COD/N for external 
and internal carbon source that provides the maximum SDNR when nitrite is used as the 
electron acceptor must be determined.  This also will include the determination of K N (for 
nitrite), K S (for carbon source), μmax for heterotrophic denitrifiers, and the denitrification 
inhibition effect. Moreover, DO inhibition concentration ( 𝐾𝑜′) has been reported to be 0.1 
to 0.2 mg/L for denitrific ation from nitrate. However, 𝐾𝑜′  value has not been reported in 
case of denitrification from nitrite.  
2. In relation to the carbon source, and due to low carbon to nitrogen ratio in real wastewater 
(municipal wastewater -MWW), denitrification process in ful l-scale wastewater treatment 
plants employ external carbon sources to minimize total nitrogen effluent. Peng et al., 2007  38 
 studied the effect of a mixture of carbon sources (starch -wastewater, mixed with methanol, 
ethanol and acetate in three bio -reactors) on nitrate denitrification. As per the literature 
review, the effect of the mixture of real wastewater and external carbon source on 
denitrification  from nitrite has not yet been reported. Accordingly, an optimum ratio of 
external and internal carbon (real wastewater) sources, kinetics and potential competitive 
effects of the two types of carbon source s are unknown. However, this is vital information 
for the design and operation of the nitrite denitrification system.  
3. Partial denitrification is the latest advance in the second generation TN removal processes. 
The process is used to partially denitrify nitrat e and nitrite and maximize nitrite 
accumulation that will be used as an electron acceptor in a downstream anammox process. 
In this process, the PDN, more specifically, the nitrite accumulation is the limiting step. A 
review of the literature showed differe nt strategies to enhance nitrite accumulation during 
denitrification from nitrate. However, several conflicting reports were observed with 
regard to the impact of COD /N ratio, carbon source type, pH level and/or nitrate/nitrite 
concentration on the accumul ation rate. However, the fundamentals behind nitrite 
accumulation over nitrate denitrification were not well understood. As a result, robust 
engineering process control strategies were not identified. Therefore research comparing 
nitrite and partial denitr ification processes would be required to understand the process 
kinetics and ultimately device a robust control strategy that enables sustainable PDN 
processes.  
4. Microbial biodiversity and structure comparison for nitrite and nitrate denitrification on 
various taxonomic levels (phylum, class, genus and species) level had never been studied 
before. Such a comparison will allow us to compare between nitrate and nitrite 
denitrification rates and kinetics  also, the possibility of PDN study in nitrate denitrific ation 
bioreactor.    
5. The effect of introducing both nitrate and nitrite in different ratios as electron acceptors 
with internal carbon sources was never studied.  Such a scenario occurs in many treatment 
plants during nitrification when changes in DO, pH, and alkalinity enhance or impede NOB 
or AOB growth.

The objective of this study was to investigate dynamic specific denitrification rates (SDNR) from 
nitrite at various chemical oxygen demand (COD) / nitrogen (N) ratios using municipal wastewater 
(MWW). A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) continuously fed with  primary effluent and nitrite 
solution were operated at hydraulic retention time of 8.4 hrs and solids retention time of 26 -30 
days for 3 months. Influent MWW characteristics varied significantly during the study i.e. 200 -
810 mgCOD/L and 6 -80 mgN/L. The SD NR from the SBR were compared with those determined 
in four batch reactors using acetate. The SDNR was directly related to COD/N until a maximum 
SDNR (mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d) of 0.07 for MWW and 0.4 for acetate occurred at COD/N ratios of 
6 and 13, respectively; beyond this COD/N ratio, SDNR decreased. The biomass yield coefficients 
(mgVSS/mgCOD) were 0.33 for MWW and 0.51 for acetate. The relationships of SDNR with 
COD/N and F/M ratios were developed.  
 
3.1 Introduction  
Biological nitrogen removal processes typica lly used in municipal wastewater (MWW) treatment 
operations involve nitrification of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite followed by denitrification of 
nitrite and nitrate to nitrogen gas. Denitrification processes are often carbon -limited, requiring 
supplement ation of carbon either by fermentation of biosolids or use of external carbon sources 
such as methanol, glycerol, acetate etc.  In order to reduce energy and carbon demand, shortcut 
nitrogen removal through nitrite is gaining popularity (Capodaglio et al.,  2016). Particularly, short -47 
 cut denitrification processes can also be effectively employed with short -cut nitrification 
processes, which partially nitrify ammonia nitrogen to nitrites through suppressing the activity of 
nitrite oxidizing bacteria (Liu et a l., 2017). The emerging second generation technologies, such as 
Sharon (stable high rate ammonia removal over nitrite), Anammox (a naerobic ammonium 
oxidation),  and Canon (completely autotrophic nitrogen removal) employ short -cut nitrification 
through enhan cement of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB),  and washout of nitrite oxidizing 
bacteria (NOB), by controlling temperature, DO, and pH  (Paredes et al. , 2007 ; Li et al. ,2008 ; and 
Zhang et al. ,2008 ). Thus, the integration of denitrification or denitrification specifically in these 
processes is timely to ensure environmental sustainability in light of the benefits compared to 
denitrification from nitrates which include up to 40 % reduction in carbon, 25% reduction aeration 
energy, and minimal nitrogen oxides concentration in the final effluent.  
 
Previous studies addressed that shortcut denitrification is influenced by the effect of COD type 
and COD/N ratio similar to denitrification from nitrate. Various denitrification studies  related to 
COD/N ratios are presented in Table 3.1.  Different studies used various types of COD sources 
such as methanol, acetic acid, glycerin, glucose, and employed different concentrations of COD 
(≤ 3000 mg/L), nitrogen (≤2500 mgNO 2-N/L and ≤2500 mgNO 3-N/L), COD/N ratios (1 -106) to 
optimize denitrification performance. Some studies highlighted the effect of COD/N ratio on the 
overall denitrification rates. For example, according to a study by Ge et al. (2012), who 
investigated a wide range of COD/N rat io with three different carbon sources, i.e. acetate, 
methanol, and glucose for denitrification from nitrate, the SDNRs  increased from 0.05 to 0.6 
mgNO 3-N/mgVSS/d for acetate, and from 0.07 to 0.4 mgNO 3-N/mgVSS/d for methanol as the 
COD/N ratio increased from 1 to 25. However, the authors also observed that SDNR with glucose 
decreased from 0.64 to 0.04 mgNO 3-N/mgVSS/d with the increase in COD/N ratio from 15 to 25, 
indicating that the variation of SDNR and optimum COD/N for maximum SDNR depends o n the 
carbon type. Similarly, a  recent study by Katarzyna et al. (2015)  who operated an SBR process 
fed with glycerin for nitrite -denitrification at different COD/N ratios of 2 -4 (nitrite concentration 
of 100 mg/L) also reported a SDNR of 0.23 to 0.45 mg NO 2-N/mgVSS/d, indicating better 
denitrification with higher COD/N ratio.

 In order to better understand the effect of COD/N ratio on dentirification , COD consumed /Nremoved  
(ΔCOD/ΔN) needs to be considered.  Chung et al. (2002) who studied denitrification from nitrite 
with glucose, methanol, ethanol, and peptone (COD/N ratio 10 with NO 2-N of 100 mg/L and COD 
of 400 mg/L) mentione d that the ratio of ΔCOD/ΔNO 2-N varied from 3.8 to 4.3 with SDNR 
ranging from 0.76 to 1.59 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d. Similarly, a comprehensive study by Frison et al., 
(2013),  who tested the effect of five different carbon types on SDNR and ΔCOD/ΔN ratio, found 
that SDNR with acetic acid, glycerol, organic fraction of the municipal solid waste (OFMSW, 
fermentation liquid) , OFMSW drainage liquid, and cattle manure and maize silage (CMMS)  were 
1.14, 0.11, 0.65, 0.51, 1.16 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d at ΔCOD/ΔN ratios of 2.1, 2.3 , 3.1, 2.7, 3.0, 
respectively, indicating that ΔCOD/ΔN was carbon type specific without direct relationship 
between SDNR and ΔCOD/ΔN.  
Scrutiny of the previous studies (Table 3.1) indicated that while the effect of COD/N on 
denitrification from nitrate has been extensively studied, the research on the effect of COD/N on 
denitrification from nitrite is limited (Chung et al., 2002; Frison et al., 2013; Beccari et al., 1983; 
Adav et  al., 2010). In addition, most nitrite denitrification studies used synthetic wastewater and 
solid waste by -products. As far as our knowledge goes, studies on denitrification of nitrites with 
real wastewater are not reported. Furthermore, most of the previ ous studies were conducted in 
narrow ranges of COD/N ratios with optimum values of    2 -5. However, since wastewater influent 
characteristics vary widely, the information on the effect of COD/N on denitrification in a wide 
range with real wastewater is lac king. Furthermore, the relationship between initial COD/N ratio 
and ΔCOD/ΔN ratio is not readily available as earlier studies merely reported these values (Beccari 
et al., 1983; Chung et al., 2002; Katarzyna et al., 2015;  Frison et al., 2013 ). 
 
Hence, the  objective of this research work was to explore the denitrification of nitrite using 
municipal wastewater at different initial COD/N and corresponding ΔCOD/ΔN ratios. The nitrite -
denitrification performance was monitored using an SBR fed with municipal was tewater to 
determine the effects of a wide range of COD/N ratios on nitrogen removal. Since the COD/N  in 
MWW varies seasonally and temporally in a wide range; this study elucidates the dynamic 
denitrification rates at various conditions. In addition, the e ffect of COD/N ratio on denitrification 
rate using nitrite was determined using pure acetate as the carbon source.

 3.2 Materials and Methods  
3.2.1  Bioreactor setup and operation  
A bioreactor (shown in Figure 3.1) with a working volume of 10.5 L, equipped with a mechanical 
stirrer, dissolved oxygen sensor, ORP and pH meters, connected to a control unit, was used in the 
experiments. The system included air diffuser and DO control units for operation at different 
dissolved oxygen levels to control nitritation and nitratation; however, for the purpose of this 
study, the system was anoxically operated without aeration. The volumes of the influent and 
effluent tanks were 60 L and 50 L, respectively, while a 3.8 L tank was used for feeding additional 
nitrite (100 mL/min for 2 min) to control the initial nitrite concentration in the reactor.  
The SBR cycle length was 240 min (6 cycles per day) with 20 min MWW and 1min nitrite feed, 
110 min react phase under completely -mixed anoxic conditions, 90 min settling time, and 20 min 
decanting. The fill was around 48% i.e. in each cycle, 5L were decanted and replaced with 5L of 
feed, corresponding to a daily feed flow of 30L. The solids retention time (SRT) was maintained 
between 2 6 -30 days by wasting 0.35 -0.41 L/d of the mixed liquor during the anoxic react phase. 
Mixing in the SBR was only used during the reaction period. The bioreactor was operated at room 
temperature.  . pH and ORP were monitored to ensure anoxic conditions during the study and were 
in the ranges of 8 -9 and -250 to -350 mV, respectively. Although the influent MWW had a pH in 
the range of 7.0 -7.2, alkalinity production due to denitrification increased the  SBR operating pH.  
The influent wastewater, which was primary effluent of the Greenway Wastewater Treatment plant  
(London, ON, Canada), was collected every 7 -10 days. A synthetic nitrite stock solution was 
prepared using sodium nitrite with concentrations of 140 -1900 mg NO 2-N/L, corresponding to 
2.75-36 mg NO 2-N/L in the SBR. Prior to the beginning of the experiments, the biomass underwent 
a three -week acclimatization period (4 cycles per day for two weeks, 20 L/d), introducing 5 L of 
activated sludge per d ay for 3 times in the first week. Due to phosphorus release during the first 2 
weeks of the start -up, the operation cycle was reduced from 6 hr to 4 hr.

3.2.2  Batch tests   
In order to examine the effect of different COD/N ratios on the denitrification rate from nitrite 
using acetate, the offline batch tests (B1, B2, B3, B4) were conducted using acetate in four 1 L 
flasks for a period of 4 hr with the MWW -acclimatized biomass collected f rom the SBR and 
concentrated by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 rpm. One liter of distilled water was added to 
each flask, containing NaHCO 3 (120 mg/L) (alkalinity source), KH 2PO 4, MgSO 4·7H 2O (100

3.2.3 Analytical methods  
The SBR influent and effluent, as well samples from the kinetic tests conducted in the SBR, were 
analyzed weekly. A total of 17 samples from influent and effluent of SBR, 80 samples (10 kinetic 
tests x 8 sample per test) from the SBR, and 32 sample s for acetate test (4 kinetic tests x 8 samples 
per test) were analyzed to calculate SDNR and ΔCOD consumed /ΔN removed . The collected samples 
were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), total COD 
(TCOD), soluble COD (SCOD), ammonia, nitrite (NO 2-), total nitrogen (TN), soluble nitrogen 
(SN), total phosphorus (TP), and soluble phosphorus (SP). Sterile 0.45 µm membrane filter papers 
(VWR International, Canada) were used for filtration of the samples, and 1.2 µm filters were used 
for TSS and VSS analyses in accordance with Standard Methods ( APHA et al., 2005 ). HACH 
methods were used to measure total phosphorous (Method 10127), ammonia (Method 10031), total 
nitrogen (Method 10072), nitrite (Method 8153), and COD (Method 8000).   
 
3.3 Results and Discussion  
3.3.1 Reactor pH and ORP   
As a measu re of the denitrification conditions, ORP and pH of the reactor were monitored, and 
representative data are shown in Figure 3.2.  With the addition of nitrite to the SBR, the ORP 
rapidly increased, with the magnitude of increase depend on the concentration of nitrite.  For 
example, ORP increased from -350 to -250 mV, corresponding to a nitrite concentration of 9.0 
mg/L (Figure 3.2). The increase in ORP was due to the increase in the concentration of oxidants  
  55 
 (i.e. nitrite), however, the ORP dropped with time with the reduction of nitrite, and dropped further 
upon addition of MWW.  
The pH sharply increased from 8.70 to 9.1 during de nitrification in each cycle (Figure 3.2), and 
decreased to 8.7 again when denitrification ended, and municipal wastewater was fed to the 
bioreactor at a pH of 7.0 -7.2. This can be related to the following stoichiometric equation (Ge et 
al. 2012):  
2𝑁𝑂2−+𝐶𝐻3𝑂𝐻 →𝑁2+𝐻2𝑂+𝐶𝑂2+2𝑂𝐻− 
Kim et al. (2004) reported that the optimum denitrification rates from nitrite were not affected by 
pH up to 11.0, and thus there was no inhibition due to pH during this study.

3.3.2  Influent and effluent characteristics  
The summary of influent and effluent water quality parameters is presented in Table 3.3, which 
shows that TCOD varied from 200 to 800 mg/L (average 526 ±332  mg/L), and SCOD varied from 
83 to 350 mg/L (average 176 ±55 mg/L). The average primary effluent BOD 5 during the study was 
232mg/L or 44% of the average measured TCOD.  The NO 2-N fed to the SBR varied between 2.75 
and 40 mg/L , with an average of 30 mg/L. With highly variable influent characteristics, a steady -
state condition was not achieved in the SBR , as can be seen in Figures 3.3A-3.3D. Since the 4 -hr-
cycle in closed SBR system was anoxic and DO was near zero, no nitrates were detected in the 
effluent.

As indicated by MLVSS variations during this study in Figure 3.3A, complete acclimatization was 
considered after 20 days as the biomass levels showed an increasing trend with consistent COD 
and nitrite removal ratio, reflected by SDNR/SSUR (specific substrate utilization rate) in the 
denitrifying SBR (Figures 3.3C and  3.3D). TN i concentrations estimated based on the combined 
concentrations of TN in the influent wastewater and the nitrite added in the SBR according to Eqs. 
3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 varied between 6 and 36 mg/L (Figure 3.2B).

Similarly, the average SN i (influent) concentration was 65 mg/L comprised of NH 3-N, NO 2-N, and 
soluble organic nitrogen concentrations of 30 mg/L, 30 mg/L, and 5 mg/L, respectively (Figure 
3.2C). Conversely, the average SN e (effluent) was 41 mg/L including 22 mg/L NH 3-N, 10 mg/L 
NO 2-N, and 9 mg/L of soluble organic nitrogen. An average of 12 mg/L TKN (TKN i of 51 mg/L  
  57 
 less TKN e of 39 mg/L) including 8 mg/L of NH 3-N was removed, and 20 mg/L nitrite was 
decreased as well due to anabolic metabolism (assimilation in biomass) and catabolic metabolism 
(dissimilation to N 2), respectively. The observed difference between influent and effluent soluble 
organic nitrogen of 4 mg/L is attributed to the hydrolysis of the effluent biomass in the effluent 
tank, which had a retention time of ≤ 1.7 day.  The average removal efficiencies of COD and nitrite 
varied between 32% -88% (average 64% for TCOD and 56% for SCOD) and 50% -91% (average 
72%), respectively.  
 
Figure 3.4A presents the relationship  between the nitrite removal efficiency and the influent 
TCOD/NO 2-N ratios, indicating that there is an optimum COD/NO 2-N ratio beyond which nitrite 
removal efficiency decreased. Further explanation of the effect of COD/NO 2-N ratio is shown in 
the kinetic section below. Previous research indicated that complete denitrification using a 
synthetic wastewater required a stable BOD/N ratio of 3 to 3.2 during the process (Rocher et al., 
2015). However, in this study it was very difficult to maintain a stable COD/ N ratio due to the 
high variability of the influent COD. Therefore, influent nitrite concentration varied depending on 
the influent COD.  Although the COD/N ratio varied widely at 9±8 with a relative standard 
deviation (RSD) of 89%, the average nitrite rem oval efficiency in the SBR was 72%. Furthermore, 
the ΔCOD/ ΔN ratios, calculated from the ratio of the specific substrate (SCOD) uptake rate 
(SSUR) and SDNR (SSUR/SDNR), showed a relatively lower variation at 3.3 ±1.8 with a RSD of 
55%. Total nitrogen in the effluent (Figure 3.3B) was high due to the remaining nitrite and 
ammonia nitrogen. Although influent ammonia concentration was 30 mg/L, accounting for 50% 
of SN i (Figure 3.3C), only a small portion of TKN was removed (11 mg/L) inclu ding 8.0 mg/L of 
ammonia by biomass synthesis and the remaining ammonia was included in the effluent soluble 
nitrogen (SN e) of 41 mg/L.

 3.3.3  Kinetic Studies at different COD/N ratios   
3.3.3.1 FNA and COD Inhibition in relation to COD/N  
The denitrification kinetic studies were performed at different total and soluble COD to nitrite -N 
(COD/NO 2-N) ratios in the SBR with real wastewater and in batch reactors with different 
concentrations of acetate to determine the specific denitrification rate (SDNR) for both carbon 
sources. The COD/N ratios represent the initial TCOD, SCOD, and NO 2-N in the tests. The kinetic 
data followed zero -order kinetics and the SDNRs were calculated by dividing the slope of the line 
of nitrite concentration removed during  the SBR anoxic cycle normalized to the time -day (mgNO 2-
N/L/d) by the MLVSS concentration. Similarly, the SSURs were calculated by dividing the slope 
of the line of COD concentration removed during the SBR anoxic cycle normalized to the time -
day (mgCOD/L/d ) by the MLVSS concentration. During the SBR kinetic tests, the initial SCOD/N 
ratios ranged from 2 -25. It must be asserted that the SSUR was calculated based on SCOD 
removed, taking into consideration the COD solubilized from the hydrolysis of particulate  organics 
using a hydrolysis coefficient of 1.8 d-1 (Kappeler and Gujer, 1992; Jeppsson,1996; Drolka et al., 
2001) of the average influent VSS. The adjusted TCOD/N was estimated by adding a COD of 1.42 
gCOD/gVSS to the measured SCOD during each 4 -hr-cycle,  yielding the TCOD/N ratio of 3 -35. 
In the range of COD/N ratios, SDNR varied between 0.01 -0.07 mgN/mgVSS/d, (Figure 3.4B). A 
similar maximum SDNR of 0.07 mgN/mgVSS/d was reported by Raboni et al. (2014) for 
wastewater, but using nitrate in the pre -anoxic reactor.   
The SDNR with MWW linearly increased with the increase in SCOD/N ratio in the 3 -6.6 range. 
There was an optimum SCOD/N ratio beyond which SDNR decreased, with similar trend and 
values (Figure 3.4B). With acetate as a carbon source, much greater SDNRs were obtained 
compared to those of municipal wastewater. The highest SDNR (0.4 mgN/mgVSS/d) with acetate 
was observed at COD/N ratio of 13.5 beyond which SDNR decreased (Figure 3.4B). The higher 
SDNR achieved with acetate relative to wastewater was d ue to higher and faster biodegradability 
of acetate (100% biodegradable), as compared with the MWW organics which are typically a 
complex mix of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and VFA.  Nevertheless, both carbon sources 
(wastewater and acetate) showed th e similar trend with respect to the effect of COD/N ratio on 
SDNR. It should be noted that at SCOD/NO 2-N ratios < 6.6 the NO 2-N concentrations ranged 
from 17 to 36 mg/L. On the other hand, at  SCOD/NO 2-N ratios > 6.6 the NO 2-N concentrations  
  62 
 ranged from 2.75 to 9 mg/L. As shown later, the K NO2 derived from the kinetic studies was 4.07 
mgNO 2-N/L and therefore the observed decline in SDNR with MWW can be explained by the low 
ambient NO 2-N concentrations relative to K NO2, as per  the Monod model. As shown in Figure 
3.4B, SDNR with acetate peaked at 0.41 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d, at COD/N ratio of 13.5 and NO 2-
N concentration of 13.8 mg/L (Table  3.2). The observed reduction in SDNR occurred at high 
acetate concentrations (B3 and B4 – Table 3.2) of  > 300 mgCOD/L, and may be attributed to the 
lack of biomass acclimatization to high acetate concentrations.  
Earlier researchers had shown that SDNR (NO x-N) increased with an increase in COD/N; 
however, these tests were conducted at low COD/N ratio s (2-5) with external carbon sources ( Oh 
and Silverstein, 1999; Fernández -Nava et al., 2010; Beccari et al., 1983; Chung et al., 2002; 
Katarzyna et al., 2015). The  negative effect of high COD/N ratio on SDNR was reported in very 
few studies (Adav  et al., 2010; Akuna et al., 1993; Ge et al., 2012). Additionally, denitrification 
studies with nitrite were relatively fewer than those conducted using nitrate. Adav et al. (2010) 
conducted SDNR tests using three different carbon sources (acetate, ethanol , methanol) at different 
COD/N ratios ranging <1 to 35 with carbon source concentrations of 100 -3000 mg/L, and NO 2 
concentration of 200 mg N/L. The data of Adav et al. (2010) were analyzed, and replotted in Figure 
3.5A to demonstrate the effect of COD/N ra tio on SDNR. The optimum COD/N ratio for nitrite -
denitrification rate varied with the type of carbon source, i.e. 8 for acetate, 7.5 for ethanol, and 5 
for methanol with respective SDNR of 0.048, 0.041, and 0.03 mgN/mgVSS/d. Since the tests were 
conducted at high substrate concentrations (NO 2- and COD), the decrease in SDNR at high COD/N 
ratios could be attributed to organic substrate inhibition, as suggested by Ge et al. (2012), who 
reported a  decrease in SDNR with glucose from 0.64 mg NO 3-N/mgVSS/d at COD /N of 15, and 
COD of 600 mg/L, to 0.04 mgNO 3-N/mgVSS/d at COD/N of 25, and a COD of 1000 mg/L.

Akunna  et al. (1992), who investigated the denitrification potential in a digester using glucose as 
a carbon source at a COD/N ratio of 2.3 -106 (COD concentration = 5318 mg/L and nitrite 
concentration = 50 -2500 mg/L), and found the optimum COD/N ratio to be 8.86  for nitrate removal 
(removal efficiency of 64 %), and 7.0 for nitrite removal efficiency (removal efficiency of 52 %) 
based on the influent and effluent nitrate and nitrite concentrations. The authors concluded that 
denitrification rates declined at high nitrite concentrations due to inhibition by free nitrous acid 
(FNA), which ranged between 0.017 and 0.88 mg/L.  
A graph (Figure 3.5B) was drawn to further investigate the effect of COD/N ratio on the SDNR 
(data were taken from Table 3.1). Figure 3.5B shows  that SDNR increased as COD/N ratio 
increases until a certain point beyond which SDNR decreased. Further examination of the effect 
of COD and FNA on SDNR (Figures 3.5C and 3.5D) showed that the SDNR widely varied in the 
low range of COD/N ratio (<6), indic ating the effect of different substrate type. However, average 
SDNR at COD (<2g/L) and COD (>2 g/L) were 0.19 and 0.08 mgN/mgVSS/d, respectively, 
indicating inhibition. FNA ranged from <0.01 to 0.88 mg/L, mostly less than 0.05 mg/L, and 8.2% 
of 61 data poi nts  >0.1 mg/L. SDNR at FNA of <0.05 mg/L were spread over the range of <0.01 
to 1.16 mgN/mgVSS/d, with an average 0.16 mgN/mgVSS/d, much higher than the average 0.02 
mgN/mgVSS/d at FNA concentrations of 0.1 -0.88 mg/L, indicating the minimal effect of FNA 
below 0.05 mg/L and the significant negative effect of high FNA on SDNR.   
Hence, the data from these previous studies indicated that the negative effect of high COD/N ratios 
on SDNR was possibly due to substrate and FNA inhibition. However, in this study,  the SCOD 
concentrations in the SBR and batch reactors were approximately 100 mg/L and 360 mg/L for 
municipal wastewater and acetate, respectively, minimizing the effect of substrate inhibition. 
Similarly, FNA concentration in the reactor was estimated at 0.0026 mg/L (NO 2-N concentration 
of 35 mg/L at pH of 8.2, pK A 5.6×10−4), indicating the insignificant effect of FNA.   
The relationship between TCOD/N (including the hydrolyzed particulate COD) and ΔTCOD/ ΔN 
is presented in Figure 3.6A. ΔTCOD/ ΔN were in range of 3 - 5 at the same TCOD/N ratio for 50% 
of the measured points which confirms the stoichiometric ratio of ( ΔTCOD/ ΔN =1.71/(1 -1.42Y) 
since the yield is constant for the same carbon source. However, ΔTCOD/ ΔN increased as  
  66 
 TCOD/N increased for TCOD/N r atio of  8-15, before stabilizing at ΔTCOD/ ΔN of 14 in the 
TCOD/N range of 20 -35. Since the ratio of ΔTCOD/ ΔN is in essence of the ratio of SSUR/SDNR, 
the high ΔTCOD/ ΔN are due to high apparent SSUR as a result of COD consumption for 
maintenance. Further sc rutiny of the 10 data points reveals that 8 points have TCOD/N ratio of 3 -
12, corresponding to ΔTCOD/ ΔN range of 3.0 to 7.0 which lies within the normal removal ratios  
(ΔTCOD/ ΔN).  Nevertheless, the other 2 points, corresponding to ΔTCOD/ ΔN of 11and 13.3, with 
respect to TCOD /N of 20 and 32, occurred at nitrite removals of 1.8 and 3.9 mg/L, respectively. 
Thus, ΔTCOD removed in the SBR were 24 and 43 mg/L for the initial nitrite concentrations of 
2.7 and 4.8 mg/L, respectively, or 4.5% and 8.1% of the influe nt COD and hence can be due merely 
to experimental errors.  
3.3.3.2 Impact of F/M ratio on SDNR  
Furthermore, the data  shown in Figure 3.5A can be plotted based on the Lineweaver -Burk model 
(Lai et al., 2014) (Figure 3.5B). Since ΔSCOD/ ΔN is proportional to SSUR/SDNR ratio, the 
following model was developed for wastewater (Eq. 3-4, R2=0.85):  
𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅 =1.66 𝑆𝑆𝑈𝑅 (𝑁
𝑆𝐶𝑂𝐷)
𝑖       (3-4) 
Where SDNR is specific denitrification rate (mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d), SSUR specific substrate 
utilization rate (mgSCOD/mgVSS/d), i denotes the initial feed concentrations (mg/L) of SCOD 
and NO 2-N. The Lineweaver -Burk  model fitted the experimental data for wastewater quite well.  
For acetate, the experiments were conducted mostly in the high COD/N r atios, which coincided 
very well with the data collected for wastewater as can be seen in Figure 3.6B; indicating that a 
similar model can be used for acetate in that range.   
Metcalf and Eddy Inc. et al. (2014) presented an empirical relation between SDNR NO3 and F/M 
ratio (mgBOD 5/mgVSS active biomass /d) as shown below (Eq. 3-5): 
𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅  = 0.029  + 0.03 𝐹/𝑀      (3-5) 
Eq 3-5 was further modified considering that the DO concentration in the pre -anoxic reactor due 
to the internal recirculation ratio (IR) and  return activated sludge (RAS) reversely affect SDNR. 
Raboni et al. (2014) mentioned that nitrogen removal occurs due to anabolic assimilation (cell 
synthesis from nitrate) and catabolic dissimilation (denitrification to N 2).  The assimilative part for 
denitrifiers is 0.05 ΔBOD 5×Q/(X×V anox) or (0.05 F/M). Considering the optimum ΔBOD 5/ΔNO 3- 
  67 
 N as 4 (Raboni et al., 2014) and substituting it in the above expression, we obtain 0.05×4NO 3-
N×Q/XV anox, the assimilative N = 0.2 SDNR dissimilative , which results in a NO x overall removal rate 
of 1.2 SDNR dissimilative . The other assimilative contribution was due to aerobic heterotrophs cells 
(in both RAS and IR) that still consume nitrogen for cell synthesis even with low DO according to 
the following Eq. 3-6: 
𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅 =1.2 𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅 dissimilative  𝐾𝑜/
𝐾𝑜/+𝐷𝑂 +0.05  𝐹
𝑀 𝜂𝐵𝑂𝐷  𝐷𝑂
0.2+𝐷𝑂    (3-6) 
Where K o-= 0.18 mg/L, SDNR dissimilative  = 0.07 mgNO 3-N/mgVSS/d, 𝜂𝐵𝑂𝐷  =0.9−0.95, DO 
=0.2-0.3 mg/L in the pre -anoxic zone (Raboni et al., 2014), the equation was further reduced based 
on the above assumption to Eq. 3-7:  
𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅  = 0.026  + 0.036  𝐹/𝑀      (3-7) 
In this study, assimilation of nitrogen in the biomass was predominantly due to the used ammonia 
from the wastewater which, affected anoxic removal of ammonia from wastewater, and the nitrite 
removal was directly related to SDNR dissimilative as the DO was near zero, and the biomass was 
strictly denitrifiers (no nitrogen assimil ation by aerobic microorganisms). With the above 
conditions and applying similar principles to those mentioned by Raboni et al. (2014), an empirical 
relation between SDNR dissimilative  (mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d) and F/M (mgSCOD/mgVSS/d) was 
derived (Eq. 3-8) and the  results are presented in Figure 3.7A: 
𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 =0.32  𝐹
𝑀      (3-8) 
The difference between these two models (Eqs. 3-7 and 3-8) was due to the following: (i) Raboni  
et al. (2014) used BOD/N ratio in contrast to SCOD/N ratio used in this work, (ii) only one BOD/N 
ratio was used compared to the wide range of COD/N ratio used in this work, and (iii) Raboni et 
al. (2014) considered denitrification from NO 3 as compared to  NO 2 in this work.   
 
3.3.3.3 Observed yields in the SBR and batch tests  
The observed yield (Y H), was estimated according to a study by Rahman et al. (2016). The carbon 
to nitrogen ratio (COD/N) was calculated by plotting COD concentration versus nitrite 
concentration during the anoxic cycle of the SBR and the slope is the ratio of removal of nitrite to 
COD nitrogen (or the ratio of SDNR/SSUR). The value of the yield depends on the operational 
conditions including substrate type. In this study, the Y HD values are estimated based on 95% 
confidence limit for both municipal wastewater and acetate.   
  68 
 The observed yield (Y HD – mgVSS/mgCOD) is then calculated based on the following Eq. 3-9: 
𝑌𝐻𝐷=(1− 1.71  𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅
𝑆𝑆𝑈𝑅)/1.42      (3-9) 
Where SDNR is specific de nitrification rate and SSUR is specific substrate utilization rate mg 
COD/mg VSS/d. The ratio of SDNR/SSUR was plotted for wastewater and acetate as shown in 
Figure 3.7B, and the observed yield (Y HD) was 0.33 and 0.51 mgVSS/mgTCOD for municipal 
wastewater (MWW) and acetate, respectively. Based on the 0.33 mgVSS/mgTCOD for municipal 
wastewater, the removed TCOD of 368 mg/L (Table 3.3), and the estimated nitrogen content of 
VSS (0.1 mgN/mgVSS), the TKN consumed for cell growth was estimated as 13 mgN/L, very 
close to the measured average of 12 mg/L with Y HD of 0.32 (Table 3.3).  
The biomass yield based on nitrite consumption (Y N, mgVSS/mgNO 2-N) was calculated according 
to the stoichiometric Eq. 3-10 (Metcalf and Eddy Inc. et al., 2014):  
𝑌𝑁=(  1.71 𝑌𝐻
1− 1.42  𝑌𝐻)       (3-10) 
Substituting in the above equation Y N (mgVSS/mgNO 2-N) is obtained as 1.062 for MWW 
(TCOD), and 3.16 for acetate. Kornaros et al. (1996) reported Y N of 1.41 with nitrite and 2.43 
mgVSS/mgNO 2-N for nitrate with glutamate as carbon  source.  
The yield was also calculated from half reactions with ammonia as the nitrogen source for biomass 
and nitrite as the electron acceptor as shown in the following overall stoichiometric reaction:   
0.02𝐶10𝐻19𝑂3𝑁+0.19𝑁𝑂2−+0.19𝐻++0.094  𝐶𝑂2+0.094 𝐻𝐶𝑂3−+0.0015 𝑁𝐻4+
=0.0215 𝐶5𝐻7𝑂2𝑁+0.095𝑁2+0.2135 𝐻2𝑂 
From the above equation Y H is 0.3 mgVSS/mgCOD, close to measured yield value of 
0.33mgVSS/mgCOD (10% difference).

 3.3.3.4 Monod Kinetics  
In order to determine other kinetic parameters such as 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 and K NO2, the Monod equation (Eq. 
3-11) (Metcalf and Eddy Inc. et al., 2014) was used.  
𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅 =(1−1.42𝑌ℎ
1.71)[𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 ∗𝑆𝑠
𝑌ℎ (𝐾𝑠+𝑆𝑠)](𝑆𝑁𝑂2
𝐾𝑁𝑂2+𝑆𝑁𝑂2)(𝐾𝑜′
𝐾𝑜′+𝑆𝑜)(𝜂)(𝑋ℎ
𝑋𝑣𝑠𝑠)   (3-11)  
Where K NO2 is half saturation concentration (mg/L), K S is half saturation concentration (mg/L)  
𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 is biomass specific growth rate (d-1), 𝐾𝑜′ is DO denitrification -inhibition concentration 
(mg/L), and S s, SNO2, So are the concentrations of COD (mg/L), NO 2-N (mg/L), and DO (mg/L), 
respectively.  Eq. 3-11 can be simplified to Eq. 3-12 since DO is close to zero in this work and the 
denitrifying consortia are strictly anoxic ( 𝜂=1). Additionally, substrate concentratio n is 
significantly higher than the reported Ks of 4 mg/L for wastewater and 1 mg/L for acetate (Kujawa 
and Klapwijk , 1999).    
𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅 =(1−1.42𝑌ℎ
1.71)[𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑌ℎ ](𝑆𝑁𝑂2
𝐾𝑁𝑂2+𝑆𝑁𝑂2)= 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑌𝑁  𝑆𝑁𝑂2
𝐾𝑁𝑂2+𝑆𝑁𝑂2    (3-12) 
However, 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 can be directly related to Y N (1.26 mgVSS/mgNO 2-N for MWW and 3.16 
mgVSS/mgNO 2-N for acetate) and K Dmax (maximum SDNR) of 0.07 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d for 
MWW and 0.4 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS /d for acetate, according to the relation of K Dmax=µmax/YN, hence, 
𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥  was obtained as 0.075 d-1 for municipal wastewater and 1.26 d-1 for acetate.  
Using Eq. 3-12 with the replacement Y H by Y N, the Hanes plot was drawn (Eq. 3-13, and Figure 
3.7C).   
𝑁𝑂2−𝑁
𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅= 𝑁𝑂2−𝑁
𝐾𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥+𝐾𝑁
𝐾𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥        (3-13) 
Where K Dmax is substituted by 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥/YN, KN was determined as 4.07 mg/L (for MWW). This 
explains why complete removal of NO 2-N was not possible in the SBR with initial NO 2-N 
concentration of 2.75 and 4.8 mg/L due to the switching function of NO 2-N/(K N+NO 2-N). The 
obtained 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥  is in accordance with the reported values (1 - 4 d-1) for external carbon sources 
(deBarbadillo et al., 2008; Kornaros et al., 1996; Yang et al., 2007; Koike and Hattori, 1975). The 
reported half -saturation coefficients ( KNO2 and K NO3) are 0.9 mgNO 2-N/L and 1.4 mgNO 3-N/L for 
acetate (Dosta et al., 2006) and 0.28 mg NO 2-N/L and 0.77 mgNO 3-N/L for L -glutamic acid  
  71 
 (Kornaros  et al., 1996). However, Her and Huang (1995b) reported K NO2 of 10.9 mg/L and K NO3 
of 14.3 mg/L with methanol which are higher than the values reported in this work.

3.4 Conclusions   
A comprehensive study on denitrification from nitrite with real municipal wastewater and acetate 
as carbon sources was conducted at varying initial COD/N ratios. The specific denitrification rate 
(SDNR) was directly related to COD/N ratio, and a maximum SD NR of 0.07 (for wastewater) and 
0.4 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d for acetate occurred at COD/N ratios of 6 and 13 respectively.  At higher 
COD/N ratios, SDNR decreased. The yield coefficients were found to be 0.33 mgVSS/mgTCOD 
for municipal wastewater and 0.51 mgVSS/mg COD for acetate.  Predictive models were 
developed to determine SDNR as a function of initial COD/N ratio and F/M ratio.

Nitrite D enitrification using Biomass Acclimatized with M ethanol as  
Complementary carbon source : Long -term Performance and Kinetics study  
Ahmed Badia1, Mingu Kim2, Martha Dagnew1*

The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamic specific denitrification rates (SDNRs) 
from nitrite at various COD/N ratios in a system that used methanol as a complementary carbon 
source. An SBR fed with municipal wastewater (MWW), methanol and  nitrite solution was 
operated at an HRT of 8.4 hrs and SRT of 16 -17 days for 110 days. The SDNR from the SBR 
employing methanol as a complementary carbon source was compared with those determined in 
23 batch reactors employing MWW, methanol, nitrite, and nitrate. The batch tests were conducted 
using the biomass acclimatized with nitrite and methanol as a complementary carbon source. The 
maximum SDNR was 0.52 mgN/mgVSS/d, corresponding to COD/N ratios of 5.9 in the SBR, 
which was about eight times higher th an the literature reported value for systems fed with MWW. 
However, the maximum nitrite SDNR was lower than the observed batch nitrate 1.06 mgNO 3--
N/mgVSS -d SDNR using the nitrite acclimatized biomass. In the batch test, a lower nitrite SDNR 
(0.38 mgNO 2--N/mgVSS/d) was achieved using methanol as a sole carbon source. The nitrite 
denitrifier yields were 0.39 and 0.34 mgVSS/mgCOD using methanol as a complementary and 
sole carbon source, respectively. The half -saturation coefficient of nitrite (K NO2) during post-
denitrification with methanol was found to be 9.2 mg/L, which confirmed the lower SDNR values 
at lower nitrite concentrations below the K NO2. The higher SDNR rates in methanol usage as a 
complementary carbon source versus sole carbon source could be t ranslated into 37% capital and 
operating cost savings.  
 
4.1 Introduction  
Conventional  nitrogen removal from domestic wastewater is a process that involves nitrification 
of ammonia and soluble biodegradable organic nitrogen to nitrate and nitrite. Then, th ese oxidized  
  79 
 forms of nitrogen can be reduced to nitrogen gas by facultative heterotrophs when a carbon source 
is available.  Most of the nitrogen removal treatment technologies in wastewater treatment plants 
employ nitrification and denitrification processes. This process is accompanied by the removal of 
organic carbon, which acts as an electron donor. As denitrification occurs under anoxic conditions, 
the process is affected by various parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO), type and availability 
of organic carbon, COD -to-nitrogen ratio, temperature, and pH. (Almeida et al., 1995; Badia et al., 
2019; Her & Huang, 1995b; Peng et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 1999)   
 
Further, new processes are being developed for biolog ical nitrogen removals (BNR) such as 
anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) and partial nitrification -denitrification  (Campos et 
al., 2019; Schmidt et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2019) . Notably, ANAMMOX technology, which 
removes ammonia nitrogen with nitrite under anaerobic condition, received substantial attention 
as it significantly reduces aeration cost and external carbon use. In order to achieve a successful 
ANAMMOX process, partial nitrification technology, by converting par t of the ammonia to nitrite, 
was also extensively studied  (Castro -Barros et al., 2017; Fudala -Ksiazek et al., 2014; Liu et al., 
2010; Yang et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 2014) . However, conventional biological nutrient removal 
(BNR) technologies are still widely used due to system stability and the scale -up issue of emerging 
technologies  (Daigger et al., 2019; Du et al., 2019; Fofana et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2010; Onnis -
Hayden et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2007) . One viable option for saving energy without significant 
modification of th e system is the combination of partial nitrification and nitrite denitrification, the 
nitrite shunt process. Compared to denitrification from nitrates, nitrite shunt processes saves up to 
40% reduction in carbon, 25% reduction aeration energy, and lower ca pital cost.  
 
Nitrite denitrification naturally occurs in ammonia -rich wastewater (ammonia ≥100 mgN/L) 
treatment processes such as side -stream wastewater treatment processes  (Ruiz et al., 2006) . 
However, cases for nitrite accumulation and further direct denitrifi cation from nitrite is an 
emerging concept in mainstream municipal wastewater treatment observed either during nitrite 
shunt or partial denitrification processes. In the nitrite shunt processes, oxygen is limiting that 
creates out -competition of the nitrit e-oxidizing bacteria by the denitrifying bacteria for nitrite  (Gu 
et al., 2018; Mehrabi et al., 2020) . However, most of these studies, the nitrite accumulation and 
nitrite denitrification, were not decoupled; hence the much -needed nitrite denitrification kinetics  
  80 
 information was not available. Another application that reported nitrite accumulation was duri ng 
denitrification from nitrate. Some of the cases where nitrite accumulation or nitrite denitrification 
has been discussed were in mainstream partial denitrification processes.  In side -stream wastewater 
treatment, nitrite appears as an end product during  nitrate denitrification. Mohan et al.  (2016 ) 
studied denitrification of high strength wastewater with  acetate and observed significant nitrite 
accumulation of 400, 1000, 2000, 2700 mgNO 2--N/L corresponding to 677, 1354, 2031, 2708 
mgNO 3--N/L feed nitrate concentration, respectively. Partial denitrification from nitrate has also 
been reported in municipal wastewater treatment under limited carbon availability. Ge et al. (2012 ) 
observed nitrite accu mulation of 22 mgNO 2--N/L with glucose during denitrification from nitrate 
(40 mgNO 3--N/L) at COD/N of 15 and a maximum accumulation of 17 and 19 mgNO 2--N/L with 
acetate and methanol, respectively, at COD/N of 25. Similarly, a study by Li et al.  (2008 ) showed 
more than 90% nitrite accumulation (90 mgNO 2--N/L) during denitrification from nitrate using 
pyridine at 2, 4, 9, and 13 COD/N ratios. A high nitrate SDNR of 1.8 mgNO 3--N/mgMLSS -d was 
obtained at all COD/N ratios. In the same process, the nitrite SDNR was 1.15 mgNO 2--
N/mgMLSS -d, slightly lower than the nitrate SDNR for all COD/N ratios. However, the authors 
reported significant nitrite accumulation as the carbon source was exhausted before complete 
denitrification from nitrite took place. One option to achieve c omplete denitrification is by adding 
methanol as a complementary carbon source.   
 
Methanol has been used as a supplementary carbon source for denitrification from nitrate in Europe 
since 1990 to reduce total nitrogen to 2.2 mg/L, and in  China, since 2003 to meet the 
environmental regulations for total nitrogen less than 5 mg/L  (Theis & Hicks, 2012) .  The selection 
of methanol over other carbon sources is mainly related to the methanol cost as well as the 
environmental life cycle analysis (LCA). LCA is used to assess environmental impact parameters:  
ozone depletion, global warming, acidification, eut rophication, smog formation, ecotoxicity, 
particulate respiratory effects, human carcinogenic effects, and human non -carcinogenic effects. 
Methanol has the lowest impact on the LCA parameters compared to ethanol and acetic acid. For 
instance, the impact of  methanol on CO 2 emission was 1.4 kgCO 2 produced per kgNO 3 removed, 
lower than ethanol (2.07 kgCO 2/kgNO 3), and acetic acid (2.71 kgCO 2/kg NO 3).(Theis & Hicks, 
2012)  The acetate was found to have the highest impact on the ozone depletion; the ethanol impact  
  81 
 was reported as 0.146 kg CFC -11eq, which is lower than the methanol (0.16 5 kg CFC -11 eq) and 
acetate (0.339 kg CFC -11 eq) impact.  
 
Ginige  et al.  (2009 ) studied the denitrification from nitrate with methanol as a complementary 
carbon source in an SBR with different COD/N ratios, i.e., methanol -COD to NO 3-N (MCOD/N) 
of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.3, and TCOD/N of 1.2, 1.3, 2, 4.5. The study showed that the maximum SDNR 
was 0.36 mgN/mgVSS -d after sludge acclimatization at COD/N of 4.5. The above and other 
previous denitrification studies addressed the optimization of ca rbon type and COD/N ratio for 
complete denitrification from nitrate. T o the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of the previous 
research studied the effect of methanol as a complementary carbon source for denitrification of 
municipal wastewater from nitri te. Such information is essential to optimize denitrification from 
nitrite. The objectives of this study were to (i) identify the long -term effect of methanol usage as a 
complementary carbon source on SDNR and  nitrite denitrification kinetics parameters,  (ii) 
characterize the short -term performance of biomass grown on complementary methanol addition 
when fed with either internal carbon source (MWW), methanol or glucose carbon sources and in 
the presence of nitrite/nitrate as an electron acceptor.  The latte r will address the biomass’s short -
term performance under shock conditions where, for example, nitrate, as oppose to nitrite, is the 
electron acceptor or when fed with other carbon sources for the short term.  
 
4.2 Materials and Methods  
4.2.1 Bench scale setup and operation  
A bioreactor (shown in Figure 4.1) with a working volume of 10.5 L, equipped with a mechanical 
stirrer  (60 rpm), dissolved oxygen sensor, ORP and pH meters, connected to a control unit, was 
used in the experiments to ensure anoxi c conditions. The system included air diffuser and DO 
control units for operation at different dissolved oxygen levels; however, for this study, the system 
was anoxically operated without aeration. The volumes of the influent and effluent tanks were 60 
and 50 L, respectively, while a 3.8 -L tank was used for supplying nitrite (100 mL/min for 2 min) 
to control the initial nitrite concentration in the reactor.  
   
  82 
 The influent wastewater was collected from the Greenway Pollution Control Plant (PCP) (London, 
ON, Canada) every 7 –10 days and stored at 4°C before using. Previous analysis of Greenway’s 
wastewater showed high strength primary effluent with high COD up to 1000 mg/L, (Badia et al., 
2019); therefore, the reactors were fed with diluted MWW (1:1) representing the typical North 
American wastewater strength, nitrite, and methanol. High purity methanol (99.9%) was added to 
meet the desired MCOD/TCOD ratio, and the nitrite was added to maintain various COD/N ratios 
and to characterize the effect of COD/N on the SDNR.  A synthetic nitrite stock solution was 
prepared using potassium nitrite with concentrations of 5000 –17500 mg NO 2--N/L, corresponding 
to 20 –71 mg NO 2--N/L in the SBR. A 99.9% purity methanol OptimaTM Fisher Chemical (Fisher 
Scientific) was used as a complementary carbon source.  
 
The SBR was operated for 110 days in which the system reached a pseudo -steady -state 
(acclimatized biomass) after 73 days or fou r turnovers of the mean solids retention time (SRT). 
The SRT was maintained between 14 -16 days, which was estimated based on the bioreactor -VSS 
divided by final effluent -VSS in the decant tank. During the pseudo -steady state period, biomass 
concentrations varied within 17%; however, despite the four turnovers and less variability of the 
biomass, a true steady -state was not achieved due to the high variability of the influent wastewater. 
The SBR cycle length was 240 min (6 cycles per day) with 20 -min diluted  MWW feeding, 1 -min 
nitrite feeding, 1 min pure methanol feed within the desired MCOD/N range, 110 -min react phase 
under complete mix anoxic conditions, 90 -min settling, and 20 -min decanting time. The fill was 
around 48%; in each cycle, 5 L was decanted an d replaced with 5 L of feed, corresponding to a 
daily feed flow of 30 L (8.4 hr of hydraulic retention time, 10.5 L of effective bioreactor volume). 
Mixing in the SBR was only used during the reaction period. The bioreactor was operated at room 
temperature .  
 
4.2.2 Sampling and Analysis  
Influent, bioreactor and effluent samples were collected one to two times a week and analyzed for 
total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), total COD (TCOD), soluble COD 
(SCOD), ammonia, nitrite (NO 2-), total nitrogen (TN), soluble nitrogen (SN), total phosphorus 
(TP), and soluble phosphorus (SP). Samples were filtered using 0.45 µm membrane filter papers 
(VWR International, Canada) for soluble component analysis, and 1.2 µm filters were used for  
  83 
 TSS a nd VSS analyses in accordance with Standard Methods. (Ahmad & Reynolds, 1999; B eutler 
et al., 2014; Xu, n.d.)  HACH methods were used to measure total phosphorous (Method 10127), 
ammonia (Method 10031), total nitrogen (Method 10072), nitrite (Method 8153), and COD 
(Method 8000).  The pH and ORP in the reactor were monitored using Atlas Scientific Sensors.  
 
The bio reactor feed concentration was determined by analyzing the SBR samples at the beginning 
of the SBR reaction time (time zero) and the end of the SBR cycle as per equations 4-1 to 4-6. The 
influent nitrite concentration ( NO 2--Ni) was the nitrite concentratio n fed to the system; it was 
calculated by subtracting effluent nitrite mass  from the nitrite mass at time zero and dividing by 
the feed volume per cycle ( Eq. 4-1). The total feed nitrogen ( TNi) concentration was estimated 
based on the combined concentration of TN in the influent wastewater and the nitrite added in the 
SBR (Eq. 4-2). The feed soluble nitrogen concentration ( 𝑆𝑁𝑖)  was calculated similar to TN i, the 
concentration was estimated ba sed on the combined soluble nitrogen ( 𝑆𝑁) in the influent 
wastewater and the nitrite dosed to the SBR (NO 2--Ni) (Eq. 4-3)

represents the exchange volume or feed volume per cycle (5 L, 48% of SBR volume).  
 
Similarl y, the feed COD concentration, including the methanol COD (MCODi), the total 
MWW+methanol feed COD concentration (TCODi), and the soluble MWW COD 
(𝑆𝐶𝑂𝐷 )+methanol feed COD concentration (SCODi) was calculated according to Equations 4 -4, 
4-5, and 4-6. The added methanol COD concentration (MCODi) was determined by subtracting 
effluent SCOD mass ( 𝑆𝐶𝑂𝐷𝑒 ) and MWW 𝑆𝐶𝑂𝐷  mass f rom SCOD mass at time zero in the reactor 
(𝑆𝐶𝑂𝐷𝑜 ) and dividing by the feed volume per cycle (Eq. 4-4).

 4.2.3 Batch tests  
A total of 23 offline batch tests and 11 cyclic tests in the SBR were conducted. The cyclic tests 
were conducted in the SBRs to determine the maximum SDNR and kinetic parameters using 
carbon source similar to the long -term study (MWW+ Methanol) at differen t COD:N ratios, each 
lasting four hours. The offline batch tests were implemented to characterize the short -term 
performance of biomass grown on complementary methanol addition when fed with either internal 
carbon source (MWW), methanol or glucose carbon s ources and in the presence of nitrite/nitrate 
as an electron acceptor (Table 4.1). The 23 offline batch experiments were conducted at the end of 
the long term SBR study, using a concentrated (centrifuged for 10 min at 1,800 g) nitrite -
methanol+MWW acclimat ized biomass from the SBR. The batch experiments were conducted in 
a 1-L flask, at room temperature and under complete mix (180 rpm) and anoxic condition. The 
batch tests were conducted in 7 phases; each phase consisted of 4 to 6 parallel experiments that 
were carried out at the same time. The batch tests were completed over two weeks, including a 
one-day layover between the runs. One liter of distilled water was added to each flask for external 
carbon source experiments, containing NaHCO 3 (120 mg/L; alkali nity source), KH 2PO 4, 
MgSO 4·7H 2O (100 mg/L), CaCl 2 (100 mg/L), 1 mL/L of trace elements solution (composition in 
g/L for all as: EDTA 15, ZnSO 4 0.43, CoCl 2 0.24, MnCl 2 0.63, CuSO 4 0.25, Na 2MoO 4 0.22, NiCl 2 
0.19, Na 2SeO 4 0.21, H 3BO 3 0.01, and NaWO 4 0.05). For tests with the MWW, the design COD/N 
ratio was maintained by varying NO 3--N and NO 2--N concentrations. For external carbon source 
based batch tests, the methanol and glucose varied in concentrations while maintaining a constant 
nitrite and nitrate concentration.  The dissolved oxygen was removed by flushing the flasks for 5 
minutes with N 2 gas in all the batch experiments. Each test was conducted for 4 -18 hours, 
depending on the time it takes to complete the removal of the substr ate (Table 4.1). Samples were 
collected from each batch (cyclic and offline) at time zero, and then every 15 minutes for the first 
2 hours; after that, samples were collected every 1 to 2 hrs for COD, nitrite, nitrate, and DO 
analysis. Alkalinity, ammonia,  MLSS, and MLVSS were measured at the start and the end of each 
batch test.  The results were then used to determine the SDNR and the corresponding specific 
substrate utilization rate (SSUR) at different COD/N ratios for the various test conditions.

4.2.4 Kinetics calculations  
The heterotrophic denitrifier yield (Y HD – mgVSS/mgCOD)  in the SBR and batch tests was 
calculated as per Eq ( 4-7), (Badia et al., 20 19; Rahman et al., 2016) . 
𝑌𝐻𝐷=(1− 1.71  𝑆𝐷𝑁𝑅
𝑆𝑆𝑈𝑅)/1.42                                                                                                      (4-7) 
 
The theoretical yield was also calculated from half -reactions with ammonia as t he nitrogen source 
for biomass, nitrite as the electron acceptor, and methanol as electron donor, as shown in the 
following overall stoichiometric reaction

The denitrifier yield (Y N, mgVSS/mgNO 2--N) were also calculated based on nitrite removed as per 
Eq. 4-8

The Monod equation (Eq. 4-9) was used to determine the maximum specific growth rate ( 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥) 
and half -saturation coefficient (K NO2) (Eddy et al ., 2014) .

  87 
 Eq. 9 can be simplified to Eq. 4-10 because DO is close to zero in the study, and the heterotrophic 
biomass (denitrifiers) is completely anoxic ( 𝜂=1,𝐷𝑂 ≃0.0 ). Additionally, unlimited COD -
substrate (methanol) concentration significantly higher than the reported Ks of 3.8 -15 mg/L for 
methanol (Kornaros et al., 1996; Mokhayeri et al., 2008; Torres Ortiz, 2013)  was used in the batch 
test.

4.3 Results and Discussion  
4.3.1 SBR denitrification performance overview  
The pH and ORP in the reactor were monitored to ensure anoxic conditions during the study; the 
values remained between 8 –9 and −250 to −350 mV, respectively. Although the influent diluted 
MWW had a pH in the range of 7. 0–7.2, the reactor pH increased due to alkalinity production by 
the denitrification process. According to (Eddy et al., 2014) , the stoichiometric alkalinity removed 
during nitrification is about 7.14 mgCaCO 3/mgNH 3-N-removed and 50% of this amount is 
recovered duri ng denitrification. In this study, alkalinity produced per NO 2--N removed was 3.27, 
close to the theoretical value. This relationship between alkalinity and nitrogen removal can be 
found in the supporting document (Figure 4.1SD).  
 
The SBR COD and nitrogen profile during the pseudo -steady -state are presented in Figures 4.2 (a) 
and (b) .  The summary of influent and effluent quality parameters data can be found in the 
supporting document  (Table 4.1SD).  The TCODi (MWW+ Methanol) varied from 237 to 724 
mg/L (average 571 ± 332 mg/L) with an average of 430±134 and 141±112 mg/L for municipal 
wastewater COD and methanol COD, respectively. Similarly, SCODi varied from 54 to 450 mg/L 
(average 214 ± 120 mg/L), including methanol added to the system. The average  primary effluent 
BOD 5 during the study was 232 mg/L or 54% of the average measured wastewater TCOD before 
dilution and methanol addition. The average TCOD and sCOD removed were 68% and 57%,  
  88 
 respectively, and the corresponding nitrite removal ranged from 6 7-100% with an average 96% 
removal. It can be observed that the carbon source removed was not only due to methanol removal 
but was also due to an internal carbon source (MWW). This can be observed by comparing the 
average difference between inf -MCOD and ef f-SCOD of 42 mg/L, and 122 mg/L between inf -
SCOD and eff -COD.  
 
The TNi varied between 66 and 111 mgN/L (with an average of 95 mgN/L), including the 20 to 
71 mg/L NO 2--N added to the SBR. The average influent soluble nitrogen (SN i) concentration was 
72 mg/L with NH 3-N of 19.2 mg/L, NO 2--Ni of 48 mg/L, and soluble organic nitrogen 
concentrations of 4.8 mg/L. Conversely, the average effluent soluble nitrogen (SN e) was 23 mg/L, 
including 11.5 mg/L NH 3-N, 9.2 mg/L NO 2--N, and 2.3 mg/L so luble organic nitrogen. An average 
13.5 mg/L of TKN (TKN i of 32.5 mg/ L less TKN e of 19 mg/L) including, 7.7 mg/L of NH 3-N and 
39 mg/L of nitrite, was removed due to anabolic metabolism (assimilation in biomass) and 
catabolic metabolism (dissimilation to N 2), respectively. The average MLSS and MLVSS were 
4439 and 3392, respectively ( Table 4.1SD). During the pseudo -steady -state period, the MLVSS 
was 4500mg/L for seven days and stabilized at 3392 for the rest of the operating period.

Figures 4.3 and 4.4 present the relationship between the nitrite removal efficiency and the influent

 represent the initial TCODi (254 -871 mgCOD/L), MCODi (17 -372 mgCOD/L), and NO 2--Ni (20 -
60 mgN/L) in the tests. When the TCOD/N ratio approaches 8.3, the nitrite denitrification 
efficiency increased to 98%, even with low methanol -mixture content of 20% (Figure 4.3). Further 
addition of methanol to make up 50% methanol -MWW mixture content showed  no effect on the 
nitrite denitrification. However, COD/N lower than 7.5 reduced the denitrification efficiency to 
less than 70%. It can also be observed that the increase of COD/NO 2--N ratio using methanol as a 
complementary carbon source improve the deni trification efficiency due to the synergy between 
MWW and MCOD in denitrification. As discussed in the introduction, there is no previous work 
conducted on the evaluation of the impact of COD/N ratio on denitrification from nitrite under 
combined MWW and m ethanol carbon source. However, the results from the current study are 
compared with the previous denitrification with external carbon studies. For example, Akunna et 
al., 1992  found during their denitrification study with glucose (5318 mgCOD/L), the optimum 
nitrite and nitrate (50 -2500 mgN /L) removal efficiency of 54 and 70% were at COD/N ratios of 
7.0 and 8.86, respectively.  Previous research indicated that complete denitrification using 
synthetic wastewater required (methanol, ethanol, glycerol, acetate, starch, glucose, saccharose, 
propionate, lactase)  a stable BOD/N ratio of 3 to 3.2 (COD/N of 6 -6.5) during the process of 
denitrification of nitrite. (Rocher et al., 2015)   Therefore, it is recommended when optimizing the 
usage of methanol as a complementary carbon source to consider the optimum COD/N ratio to 
maximize nitrite removal efficiency, which is considered in the following discussion.

4.3.3 Impact of complementary methanol on nitrite denitrification kinetics   
At the end of the continuous SBR study, 11 cyclic tests in the SBR were conducted to identify the 
impact of complementary methanol on nitrite denitrification kinetics parameters, including the 
denitrifier yield, maximum SDNR, and half -saturation coefficien t. During this period, the biomass 020406080100

 was considered to be fully acclimatized for nitrite. This was indicated through the stable MLVSS 
data shown in Figure 4.2 SD and also reflected by the %NO 2--N removal, which indicates the 
stabilization of the denitrifying  SBR and the %N removal at various COD/N ratios (Figure 4.3) for 
methanol and the  TCOD  (Figure 4.4 ). 
 
4.3.3.1 Maximum Specific Denitrification Rate (SDNR)  
With the variation of internal COD concentrations of MWW during our experiments, we also 
varied the ratio of MCOD/TCOD in the cyclic test in order to examine the optimum ratio for the 
maximum SDNR.  The COD/N ratios represent the initial TCOD, SCOD, NO 3--N, and NO 2--N in 
the tests. The SDNRs were calculated by dividing the slope of the line of  nitrite concentration 
removed over time (mgNO 2--N/L/day) during the SBR anoxic cycle by the MLVSS concentration. 
Similarly, the specific substrate (sCOD) uptake rates (SSURs) were calculated by dividing the 
slope of the line of COD concentration removed o ver time (mgCOD/L/day) during the SBR anoxic 
cycle by the MLVSS concentration.  
 
During the SBR cyclic tests, the initial SCOD/N ratios ranged from 1.8 to 9.5, and TCOD/N of 2 -
12.5 after considering particulate COD. It must be asserted that the SSUR was cal culated based on 
SCOD removed, taking into consideration of the MCOD and the COD  hydrolysed from particulate 
organics (average influent VSS) using a hydrolysis coefficient of 1.8 day−1 (Badia et al., 2019; 
Drolka et al., 2001; Kappeler & Gujer, 1992) . The adjusted TCOD/N was estimated by adding a 
COD of 1.42 gCOD/gVSS to the measured SCOD during each 4 -hr cycle, yielding the TCOD/N 
ratio of 2 –12.5. In the range of COD/N ratios, SDNR varied between 0.01 and 0.5 
mgN/mgVSS/day (Figure 4.5). According to F ig 4.5, the optimum SDNR occurred at COD/N ratio 
of 5.9. The SDNR with MWW and methanol linearly increased with the increase in TCOD/N ratio 
in the 2.0 –5.9 range. There was an optimum TCOD/N ratio beyond which SDNR decreased. The 
main reason for the decrea se of SDNR is related to the high K NO2 of 9.2 mgN/L derived from the 
kinetic studies (section 4.3.3.3), and therefore, the observed decline in SDNR with MWW can be 
explained by the low ambient NO 2--N concentrations relative to K NO2, as per the Monod model.  
The maximum SDNR of 0.52 mgN/mgVSS/day higher than the 0.03 -0.3 mgN/mgVSS -d reported 
in the previous denitrification from nitrite studies using external carbon sources  (Adav et al., 2010; 
Akunna et al., 1993; Badia et al., 2019; Chung & Bae, 2002; Ge et al., 2012) , and comparable to  
  93 
 the value reported by (Beccari et al., 1983) .  The maximum SDNR was achieved at MCOD/TCOD 
of 0.64, meaning with 64 % of the organic carbon coming from methanol. The relatively higher 
SDNR in this study showed synergy between methanol as a supplementary carbon source and the 
MWW. In summary, the results showed that with an increase of the MCOD/TCOD to 50 -60%, a 
7.4 fold  improvement of SDNR could be achieved compared to the SDNR in using MWW  alone 
as a carbon source (SDNR=0.07 mgN/mgVSS -d, Badia et al. (2019), which can make huge savings 
in the anoxic bioreactor volume, mixing equipment and power.

4.3.3.2 Heterotrophic denitrifier yield ( 𝑌𝐻𝐷) 
The observed heterotrophic denitrifier yield (Y HD)  in the SBR was estimated after determining  the 
slope of the SDNR/SSUR (Data in supporting document, Figure 4.3SD) and substituting the value 
in Eq. 4-7. The Y HD was found to be 0.39 mgVSS/mgTCOD for methanol + MWW. Further, based 
on the estimated Y HD of 0.39 mgVSS/mgTCOD for the mixture of methano l and municipal 
wastewater, the removed TCOD of 383 mg/L ( from Table 4.1SD), and the estimated nitrogen 
content of VSS (0.1 mgN/mgVSS), the TKN consumed for cell growth was estimated as 16 
mgN/L. On another note, the Y HD, according to the 13.6 mg/L averag e ammonia removed (TKN 
used for biomass = (Influent NH 3 – Effluent NH 3)/0.6) in the SBR resulted in Y HD =0.35, close to 
the estimated value that is comparable to the yield of MWW (Badia et al., 2019) .  The Y HD is lower 
than the 0.46 obtained for methanol when used in post denitrification (data not shown), which 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7

 indicates that using methanol as a complementary carbon source improves not only the SDNR but 
also lowers the sludge produced compared with methanol usage in the post denitrification. The 
current nitrite denitrifier yield value was compared with the nitrat e denitrifier yield using various 
carbon sources . Peng et al.  (2007 ) estimated a yield 0.4, 0.42, and 0.65 mgVSS/mgCOD  for 
methanol, ethanol, and acetate, respectively, which is close to the yield estimated in this study. 
Other yield studies by Guven et al.  (2018)  reported a yield coeff icient of 0.45 mgVSS/mgCOD for 
a mixture of acetate, propionate, ethanol, and glucose, and Sobieszuk & Szewczyk  (2006 ) reported 
0.44 mgVSS/mgCOD  for methanol. Both were studies for the denitrification from nitrate, which 
are in good agreement with the yield estimated in the current study. On another note, Bernat et al.  
(2015 ) reported a daily variation on yield (ranging from 0.27 to 0.44), which depended on the daily 
operation conditions and COD/N ratio. Usi ng Eq ( 4-8), the denitrifier yield (Y N, mgVSS/mgNO 2-
-N) was estimated as 2.27 and 1.48 mgVSS/mgN  for methanol only (post denitrification) and 
methanol with MWW (pre -denitrification), respectively. The estimated values were higher than 
the estimated Y N of 1.062 mgVSS/mgNO 2--N using  MWW only (Badia et al., 2019) , lower for 
values that made use of acetate 3.16 mgVSS/mgNO 2--N as a carbon source and comparable to 
Kornaros et al.  (1996)  that stated a yield Y N of 1.41 mgVSS/mgNO 2--N in a kinetic study using 
glutamate. The literature showed that the acetate yield is higher than the methanol or MWW yield; 
in this study, the combination of methanol and MWW provide yield close to the MWW only yield 
(0.33 mgVSS/mgCOD, (Badia et al., 2019) ). 
 
4.3.3.3 Half saturation concentration and biomass specific growth rate  
The Monod equation (Eq. 4-9) was used to determine other kinetic parameters such as the 
maximum specific growth rate ( 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥) and half -saturation coefficient (K NO2) (Eddy et al ., 2014)  
The analysis was based on 4 -hr-10 cyclic tests in a post -denitrifying -SBR with methanol as a sole 
carbon source and nitrite as an electron acceptor. The 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 can be directly related to Y N (2.27 
mgVSS/mgNO 2--N) and post denitrification SDNR max (maximum SDNR) of 0.62 mgNO 2--
N/mgVSS/d, according to the relation of SDNR max=µmax/YN. Hence, 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥  was obtained as 1.4 
d-1 for methanol and nitrite in the post -denitrification SBR. The value is higher than the previously 
reported value from denitrification with nitrate, i.e., 0.5 d-1 (Mokhayeri et al., 2008) , however close 
to the estimated 1.3 d-1 (Dold et al., 2008)  and 1.25 d-1 (Nichols et al., 2007) .  The obtained 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥  
is in accordance with the reported values (0.5 - 4 d-1) for different external carbon sources  
  95 
 (deBarbadillo et al., 2008; Dold et al., 2008; Kornaros et al., 1996; Stensel et al., 1973; Yang et 
al., 2007) . Using Eq. 4-8 with the replacement Y H by Y N, the Lineweaver -Burk plot was developed 
(Eq.4-11, and Figure 4.6) to determine KNO2.

Substituting SDNR max with 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥/YN, KN was determined as 9. 2 mg/L. This explains why 
complete removal of NO 2--N was not possible in the SBR during the experimental period, and this 
was due to the switching function of NO 2--N/(K N+NO 2--N), effluent NO 2--N is 9.2 mg/L ( Table 
4.1SD). In order to decrease effluent nitrite quality, the SBR system needs to be optimized by 
increasing reaction time, SRT, and biomass concentrations. The reported half -saturation 
coefficients ( KNO2 and K NO3) are 0.9 mgNO 2--N/L and 1.4 mgNO 3--N/L for acetate  (Dost a et al., 
2007)  and 0.28 mg NO 2--N/L and 0.77 mgNO 3--N/L for L -glutamic acid (Kornaros et al., 1996) . 
However, Her & Huang  (1995a ) reported K NO2 of 10.9 mg/L and K NO3 of 14.3 mg/L with methanol, 
which is comparable to the values reported in this work. Badia et al.  (2019 ) determined the K NO2 
value of 4.07 mgN/L for MWW. The high variability in K NO2 is mainly due to the testing 
conditions, including carbon source type and concentrations and COD/N range. The reported K NO2 
for acetate and glutamic acid were much lower than the ones determined for methanol and MWW. 
It is important to note that the K NO2 reported for acetate and glutamic study were during 
denitrification from nitrate as oppose to nitrite as being the sole electron acceptor (this study). 
Thus, the much lower K NO2 values for acetate and glutamic acid could be a function of the carbon 
source and, to some extent, due to the nitrate denitrifier biomass diversity.

4.3.4 Batch tests  
The batch tests were conducted to characterize the performance of biomass acclimatized to nitrite 
as an electron acceptor and methanol as a complementary carbon source upon short -term exposure 
to a different carbon source or an electron acceptor. The carbo n sources studied include MWW 
only, methanol, and glucose, whereas the alternative electron acceptor was nitrate. Any of these 
conditions could happen in a practical setting, and it would be of benefit to understand how the 
nitrite acclimatized biomass per forms under such circumstances.  There was no nitrite removal 
with glucose after 8 -24 hours of sampling; therefore, results are not discussed further in this paper.  
 
4.3.4.1 Short -term Nitrite or Nitrate Denitrification using MWW as a sole carbon source  
Six batch tests were conducted at room temperature to investigate the acclimatized biomass 
denitrification potential from nitrite and the actual impact of carbon source change on SDNR from 
the combination of methanol and MWW to MWW as a sole carbon  source (Phase 1, Table 4.1). 
The tests were conducted by employing different nitrite concentrations (15.6, 22.8, 37, 58, 71 and 
85 mgN/L) to achieve COD/N ratios of 3.6, 4.3, 5.3, 7.7, 6.3, and 9.3 at MWW -TCOD 
concentrations 144, 144, 286, 307, 326 and 30 5 mg/L, respectively. The maximum SDNR showed 
0.47 mgN/mgVSS -d at COD/N of 5.3 (Table 4.3 and Supporting document Figures 4.4SD a and 
b). It is of importance to mention that B1 and B2 experiments were conducted one week before y = 39.698x + 4.2847

 the other (B3, B4, B5and B6) batch tests. The estimated yield coefficient and kinetic parameters 
were Y H of 0.52 mgVSS/mgCOD, µ max of 1.23 d-1, and K NO2 of 6.48 mgN/L. The denitrifier yield 
is within the range obtained in the SBR, which can be related to the biomass type developed within 
the SBR. The SDNR and the yield were as high as the values measured in the SBR despite the fact 
that the batch reactor w as primarily fed with MWW. The half -saturation coefficient (K NO2) was 
higher than the one observed for MWW of 4.07 mg/L  (Badia et al., 201 9) and lower than the o ne 
obtained using methanol (9.3 mg/L). It is also clear that for the MWW -nitrite range, the optimum 
COD/N ratio for the highest SDNR was 5.3 (Table 4.3), which was close to the COD/N in the SBR 
(5.88). T he ΔCOD/ ΔN (SSUR/SDNR) showed an inverse relation to COD/N, while COD/N 
decreased from 9.3 to 3.6, ΔCOD/ ΔN increased from 5.5 to 7.6. A similar trend was observed from 
the long term performance with methanol+MWW as carbon source; however, while the trend is 
consist ent, the magnitude of ΔCOD/ ΔN seems to be more carbon source -specific. The above 
results showed that the MWW as a sole carbon source behaved similarly to the SBR study that 
used MWW+methanol and better compared to the earlier studies that used MWW as a sol e carbon 
source. The result implies that (i) the kinetics is highly dependent on the nature of the biomass: the 
biomass acclimatized with methanol+MWW behaved differently compared with the MWW 
acclimatized biomass, and (ii) a short term switch from the MWW +Methanol to MWW as a sole 
carbon source, will not affect the denitrification performance.  
 
Similarly, four batch tests were conducted with MWW and nitrate (Phase 2, Tables 4.1 and 4.3). 
The tests were conducted under varying COD/N ratios of 1.6, 2, 3, an d 4.2 by employing various 
nitrate concentrations (46, 64, 86 and, 122 mgN/L) and TCOD concentrations of 195, 193, 174 
and 195 mg/L  (Figure 4.4SD). All SDNR values were very close at the employed COD/N ratios 
of 1.6 -4.2.  The maximum nitrate SDNR (0.15 mg N/mgVSS -d) was lower than the corresponding 
nitrite SDNR (0.47 mgN/mgVSS -d); however, we attribute the decrease of SDNR could be due to 
the nature of the biomass and the low COD/N ratio . It is plausible that the optimum SDNR  was 
not wholly achieved due to  the lower COD/N data range (1.6 -4.2) used in this test. (Akunna et al., 
1992)  obtained the optimum SDNR with glucose at COD/N of 8.86 and 7 for nitrate and nitrite, 
respectively. The yield coefficient, according to the 4 data points, was found to be 0.3  ±0.05 
mgVSS/mgCOD, which agrees with (Muller et al., 2003) . The yield of 0.3 was lower than the 
nitrite yield; this is per the stoichiometry.   
  98 
  
During the tests with nitrite and nitrate, dissimilatory nitr ate or nitrite reduction to ammonium 
(DNRA) was observed, and ammonia concentration increased at the end of each test (5 -11 mgNH 4-
N/L). According to van den Berg et al.  (2015 ) and Kraft et al.  (2014 ), the leading cause th at affects 
the dissimilatory nitrite/nitrate reduction -denitrification to ammonia is the nirF enzyme. Baideme 
et al.  (2019 ) who studied the condition of the ammonia restora tion during denitrification reported 
a relative abundance of nirF with an accumulation of ammonia when sludge age (SRT) exceeded 
12 days. In this study, alkalinity changes were related to the accumulation of ammonia, and 
alkalinity recovery per ammonia inc rease was 7.14 mgCaCO 3 per mgN, higher than the theoretical 
recovery of 3.57 mgCaCO 3/mgN denitrified from denitrification. The DNRA ranged between 5 -
11 mgNH 3-N, corresponding to 35 -78 mgCaCO 3 alkalinity restored.

4.3.4.2 Short -term Nitrite and Nitrate denitrification using Methanol as a sole carbon source  
Additional batch tests were conducted to the ones discussed above in order to discern the short -
term impact of carbon source change, from the combination of methanol and MWW to methanol 
as a sole carbon source, on the SDNR (Phases 3 and 4, Tables 4.1 and 4.4). The maximum SDNR 
in the main SBR of 0.52 mgN/mgVSS -d occurred at optimum COD/NO 2--N of 5.88 based on 
biomass acclimatized for nitrite fed with a mixture of methanol and MWW. Using the acclimatized 
biomass, the nitrite denitrification with methanol as a sole carbon source showed a relatively lower 
SDNR ranging between 0.27 to 0.38 mgN/m gVSS -d SDNR (Table 4.4) but a comparable yield  
  99 
 coefficient of Y H=0.34 mgVSS/mgCOD. The half -saturation coefficient was not obtainable 
because the nitrite concentration used was higher than the K NO2, which was chosen based on the 
requirement of the SDNR dat a. The above result confirmed the observed synergy between 
methanol+MWW, which resulted in higher SDNR compared to the methanol addition as a sole 
carbon source. The main reason for the reduction in SDNR could be attributed to the biodiversity 
of biomass t hat is acclimatized to both carbon sources together in the SBR, and when exposed to 
a methanol carbon source (methanol) in the short term test led to the µ max reduction while Y H 
remained the same.  It can also be observed, the ΔCOD/ ΔN (SSUR/SDNR) has an in verse relation 
to COD/N, while COD/N increased from 2.6 to 18.1, ΔCOD/ ΔN decreased from 4 to 2.1 (Table 
4.3). The highest SDNR of 0.38 mgN/mgVSS -d occurred at COD/N of 2.6 with a relative 
consumption of ΔCOD/ ΔN (SSUR/SDNR) of 4.0 higher than the consumption in the SBR (2.8), 
which can be attributed to the lower SDNR while the COD consumption (SSUR) is almost similar. 
On the other hand, it can be observed that the relation between COD/N and SDNR is more carbon 
source -specific; in our case, the SBR -COD/N and the COD/N -batch are different.  
 
Similarly, five batch tests were conducted with methanol and nitrate (Phase 4, Table 4.3) as a 
carbon source and electron acceptor, respectively. The highest SDNR among the five nitrate 
batches were 1.06 mgN/mgVSS -d (Table 4.3 and in supporting document Figure 4.5SD) occurred 
at the typical optimum COD/NO 3--N of 10 and the minimum ΔCOD consumed /ΔNreduced  of 1.5. The 
nitrate SDNR was much higher than the one reported in section 4.3.4.1 ( 0.15 mgN/mgVSS -d), 
confirming that the lower SDNR has associated with the COD/N ratio as opposed to the nature of 
the biomass. It indicates that biomass acclimatized with nitrite can also denitrify nitrate with high 
performance; however, the maximum SDNR was achieved at a higher COD/N (10) in the case of 
nitrate vs 5.88 in the case of  nitrite. The high COD/N  can be attributed to the higher COD required 
for denitrification from nitrate due to extra 2 -electrons transferred during the bioreaction. Though 
the COD/N ratio has a wide range (2.6 -24.5), the removal rate ΔCOD/ ΔN was high 4.0 a nd 4.9 at 
low COD/N (2.6) and high COD/N (24.5), which can be attributed to the higher nitrate -SDNR and 
SSUR.  The yield coefficient parameter was estimated as Y H=0.28 mgVSS/mgCOD. The yield 
was also calculated according to the half -reactions (with nitrate  as the nitrogen source for biomass 
and nitrate as the electron acceptor):  
0.167𝐶𝐻3𝑂𝐻 +0.1𝑁𝑂3−+0.1𝐻+=0.0218 𝐶5𝐻7𝑂2𝑁+0.039 𝑁2+0.307 𝐻2𝑂+0.058 𝐶𝑂2  
  100 
 From the above equation, Y H is 0.28 mgVSS/mgCOD, which matched exactly with the estimated 
experimental yield value.  The lower nitrate yield was in agreement with the yield reported in 
section 4.3.4.2 and also comparable to the stoichiometric yield. The alkalinity produced during 
methanol/nitrate experiments matches the ratio of 3.57 mgCaCO3/N denitrified.  
Further, the alkalinity produced during methanol experiments did not show ammonia release, 
indicating that DNRA is not only affected by the sludge age but also the carbon source type. 
Various studies reported DNRA phenomena during denitrificatio n at different carbon sources, i.e., 
organic soil  (Friedl et al., 2018)  and (Nizzoli et al., 2010) , glycerol  (Baideme et al., 2019) , and 
glucose (Lu et al., 2013) .

4.3.4.3 Short -term Combined Nitrite and Nitrate Denitrification using MWW as a sole carbon 
source  
Three batch tests were also conducted to examine SDNR from a mixture of nitrate and nitrite with 
MWW with three different NO 2:NO 3 ratios of 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1, with nitrite concentrations of 20, 
40 and 60 mgN/L (NO 2--N+NO 3--N= 60 mgN /L), maintaining a COD/NOx ratio of 3 (Table 4.4). 
In the three batches, nitrite was reduced sharply while the nitrate removal was minimal.  It can also 
be seen that the highest nitrite SDNR was 50% lower than the one observed when nitrite was used  
  101 
 as the only electron acceptor, indicating that nitrite and nitrate existence partially inhibited the 
denitrification rate with decreasing both nitrite and nitrate SDNRs.  
 
Figure 4.7 shows the denitrification rates of nitrite and nitrate at the NO 3/NO 2 ratio of 2  (B1). The 
results indicate that when high nitrate and nitrite was present, nitrate denitrification was limited 
until nitrite concentration reduces to a lower level (below 6 mg/L). Compared to observations in 
sections 4.3.4.1 and 4.3.4.2, a lower nitrate -SDNR was obtained (0.037mgN/mgVSS -d, Figures 
4.7 and 4.6SD, Table 4.4). Mehrabi et al. , 2020  reported similar, lower nitrate denitrification 
performance under the presence of nitrate and nitrite in a nitrite acclimatized biomass. The lack of 
nitrate denitri fication could be due to the biomass that was acclimatized to nitrite resulting in a 
dominance of specific types of nitrite denitrifier species; however, this needs further investigation. 
Another reason for nitrate denitrification inhibition suggested by (Tian, 2004 ) is that nitrite is very 
toxic to the denitrifying microorganisms, and due to this toxicity, the nitrite concentration inside 
the cells is much lower than the bulk liquid nitrite concentration. Due to this condition, 
microorganisms use nitrite as an electr on acceptor instead of nitrate to reduce the bulk -liquid 
external toxicity stress from nitrite. However, recent partial denitrification results from nitrate and 
a rather accumulation of nitrite over nitrate do not support the latter claim  (Badia & Dagnew, 
2020) .

4.3.5 Making a case for complementary carbon source addition: capital and operating cost 
analysis  
Methanol, as a complementary carbon source, can be employed in low concentration in the pre -
denitrification and with a high concentration in the post -denitrification. The methanol addition in 
the pre -denitrification is used when TCOD/N is lower th an the pre anoxic zone denitrification 
capacity and the addition of methanol, i.e., the MCOD/TCOD must be adjusted to minimize the 
operation cost. Similarly, using methanol in the post -denitrification will result in higher capital 
cost for an extra anoxic tank (concrete and mixing equipment) in addition to the operational cost 
of methanol when MCOD/TCOD of 1. Based on the results in this study, the COD/N ratios can be 
categorized into three levels: low level of 0 -3, a medium of 4 -7, and a high level ≥ 8 (Ta ble 4.5). 
The highest SDNR 0.4 -0.52 mgN/mgVSS -d would occur when MCOD/TCOD in the range of 0.4 -
0.6 (medium range of TCOD/N), i.e., where methanol was used as a complementary carbon source 
in the pre -denitrification anoxic tank (Figure 8 and Table 4.5). Mor eover, high SDNR of 0.32 
mgN/mgVSS -d with methanol alone would be considered when methanol is used as the sole 
carbon source in the post denitrification.  
 
According to the cost of methanol addition of 2.5 CAD/gallon  (Eleanor Key, 2018), the cost

 methanol added to achieve the respective maximum SDNR’s of 0.52 and 0.38 mgN/mgVSS -d was 
similar. However, the higher SDNR in the pre nitrite denitrification is translated  to 37% volume 
and mixing power reduction (supporting document, Table 4.2SD), which can be translated to a 
capital cost reduction associated with civil infrastructure and operating cost reduction associated 
with mixing power.  Furthermore, when we compare the cost of methanol as an external 
complementary carbon source in the pre -anoxic reactor (SDNR of 0.52 mgNO2 --N/mgVSS -d) to 
the internal carbon source of MWW (SDNR of 0.07 mgNO2 --N/mgVSS -d), the anoxic volume 
will be reduced by 86% of reactor volume. Howe ver, the methanol supply shall be added to the 
operating cost, but its continuous addition may not be required, as demonstrated in the batch 
reactors that showed higher SDNRs even after switching the carbon source from MWW + 
methanol to just MWW.

 4.4 Conclusion  
Due to the low carbon to nitrogen ratio in MWW, the denitrification process in full -scale 
wastewater treatment plants employs external carbon sources to minimize total nitrogen in the 
effluent. This comprehensive study demo fnstrated that compared to MWW as  a sole carbon source, 
denitrifier’s kinetics (t he half -saturation nitrite denitrification coefficient, denitrifier yield, and 
maximum specific growth rate) and its activity (SDNR) was higher with MWW+methanol, which 
enhances denitrification performance. B atch studies also confirmed that a short term switch from 
MWW+methanol to MWW as a sole carbon source will not affect the denitrification performance, 
creating the concept of intermittent methanol addition. Comparatively, upon using methanol as a 
sole carb on source, a lower SDNR (0.38 mgNO 2--N/mgVSS /d) was achieved, which implies that 
when methanol is supplemented with the MWW, a synergic effect occurs which enhances the 
SDNR. The addition of methanol as a complementary carbon source for nitrite denitrification can 
be considered as a mainstream proce ss even for conditions carbon is not limiting in the MWW.

The objective of this study was to investigate and compare the dynamic specific denitrification 
rates (SDNRs) from nitrate and nitrite at various COD/N ratios in two systems that use acetate as 
a carbon source. SBR1 (47 d -SRT) and SBR2(31 d -SRT) were opera ted for 126 days, with HRT 
of 16 hrs, and fed with nitrite and nitrate, respectively. The maximum SDNR NO2 and SDNR NO3 
during the cyclic tests were 0.69 and 2.67 mgN/mgVSS -d in SBR1 and SBR2, respectively. 
However, the maximum SDNR NO21 occurred during nitra te denitrification was 1.27 mgN/mgVSS -
d in SBR2 , which is double the rate in SBR1 due to nitrite accumulation stress and the difference 
in microbial structure and diversity in SBR2. The optimum operati ng condition for PDN was found 
to be at minimum COD/N o f 2.7-3, with 79% nitrite accumulation. Higher COD/N of 6.7 and 9.8 
also accumulate nitrite , but nitrite accumulated was denitrified with a maximum SDNR NO22 of 
1.04 mg N/mgVSS -d at CODN of 9.8. Kinetic parameters were also determined for nitrite in 
offline  batch experiments, and the half -saturation coefficient K NO2 was found to be 3.17 mgN/L 
and the maximum specific growth rate of 0.77 d-1. The taxonomic analysis showed Zoogloea  genus 
(42% RA) in SBR1 was more responsible for nitrite denitrification, while Thauera  genus in SBR2 
with RA of 10% was more responsible for PDN. We relate the difference in microbial structure to 
the NiR reductase and NaR reductase distribution among mic robial structure , indicating  NiR 
reductase enzymes is higher in Zoogolea  genera than NaR reductase , whereas NaR is higher than 
NiR in Thauera .

 5.1 Introduction  
It has been known that nitrogen compounds in the form of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate are t he 
primary source of severe environmental contamination problems. Ammonia and nitrite are reduced 
forms of nitrogen; hence if directly discharged to freshwater bodies, these compounds will be 
oxidized to nitrate consuming the oxygen in the aquatic environm ent. Further, the presence of any 
of the nitrogen compounds stimulates  the growth of aquatic plants and algae. When algae grow 
excessively, water force main and intakes can be clogged; algae can also block the sunlight and 
decomposes anaerobically and causes the depletion of oxygen, which in turn kill the aquatic life 
(Scientific Investigations Report , 2017) .  Subsequent decompo sition of aquatic life in freshwater 
bodies (rivers, lakes, estuaries) increase the deleterious effect on aquatic life and human health. 
The presence of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water has been reported to cause  
methemoglobinemia in the infants, a bl ue baby syndrome. Therefore, conventional (first -
generation) biological nitrification -denitrification (BN R) processes are applied to overcome such 
problems. However, employing these first -generation processes require (i) high power input for 
biological pro cess air supply, (ii) external carbon source addition for denitrification (for 
wastewater with a lower carbon to nitrogen content), (iii) larger footprint, and (iv) more extensive 
sludge treatment facilities to handle large quantities of waste activated sl udge produced during the 
process. Maktabifard et al., 2018  reported that aeration consumes 50% of the wastewater treatment 
facility’s power.  
Recently there is an increased interest in second -generation total nitrogen removal processes. One 
of these processes is called nitrite shunt that involves partial oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and 
direct denitrification from nitrite. The process saves 25% of oxygen demand and reduces 
bioreactor size due to shorter pathways from nitrite  to nitrogen gas (3 electrons) during 
denitrification , and 5 electrons are transferred to nitrate during full denitrification . Over the last 
ten years, integrating partial nitritation with the anammox process has been the most researched 
second -gene ration TN removal process. The anammox process allows ammonia removal as an 
electron donor with nitrite as an electron acceptor under an anoxic condition and in the absence of 
an organic carbon source (Chen et al., 2016)  and (Zeng et al., 2014 ), producing nitrogen gas and 
11% nitrate as end -product. The process saves 60% of oxygen if we nitrify 50% of influent 
ammonia and 90% of external carbon source as electron donor, much less sludge production due  
  115 
 to the low yield of anammox bacteria (0 .114 mgCOD/mgN) (Al-Omari et al., 2015; De Cocker et 
al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018) . Despite the substantial research on the topic, a robust partial 
nitrification -anammox process configuration for mainstream wastewater treatment are yet to be 
obtained (Antwi et al., 2019; C. -H. Ge et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2019; Tomaszewski et al., 2017; 
Trojanowicz et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Y. Yang et al., 2018) . However, the process has been 
proven for sidestream (ammonia -rich) wastewater treatment. Currently, the bottleneck for 
adopting the PNA process is the difficulty in achieving partial nitrification to nitri te due to 
difficulty to washout or suppress the nitrite -oxidizing bacteria (NOB), which requires (i) process 
operation at high temperature, (ii) short sludge age, (iii) lower organic matter content 
(COD/N˂0.5) , and (iv) lower DO concentration (Sui et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018; J. Yang et al., 
2016; D. Zhang et al., 2019) . Therefore, there is a need to employ an alternative nitrite generation 
pathway that can be integrated with an anammox process for mainstream domestic wastewater 
treatment. Most recen tly, the nitrification -partial denitrification -anammox (nitrification -PDN -
anammox) process had started to receive the attention of researchers; the process is attractive 
mainly for facilities adding external carbon source for denitrification. Compared to t he first 
generation BN R processes, the nitrification -PDN -anammox process saves 45% of oxygen and 
79% of the external carbon source addition (X. Xu et al., 2020) .  
The nitrification -PDN -anammox process takes advantage of previous observations that reported 
nitrite accumulation during denitrification from nitr ate using pure cultures (Betlach & Tiedje, 
1981; S. Ge et al., 2012; X. Yang et al., 2012) . For example, Almeida  et al. , 1995  observed a 0.33 
and 28% nitrite accumulation during nitrate denitrification by Pseudomonas Fluorescence,  at 600 
and 900 mg/L nitrate concentrations and COD /N ratios of 4.9 and 1.8, respectively . S. Ge et al., 
2012, X. Yang et al., 2012 , and Cao et al., 2013  also observed nitrite accumulation durin g nitrate 
denitrification with various carbon sources and varying COD /N ratios. S. Ge et al., 2012  observed 
a maximum of 55% nitrite accumulation with glucose at COD/N of 15 and a 42% and 47% 
accumulation with acetate and methanol, respectively, at COD/N of 25 during denitrification from 
nitrate (40 mgNO 3-N/L). Rocher et al., 2015  also observed nitrite accumulation during 
denitrification ; the accumulation was 20 -30% for most of the carbohydrates and organic acids, 
34% saccharose, 28% propanoate, 24% glucose, 24% acetat e, 23% starch, 12% lactose, while 
alcohols accumulated less than 10%,  methanol 5%, ethanol 11% and glycerol 9%. Akunna et al., 
1993  performed batch tests on nitrate (140 to 200 mgNO 3-N/L) reductions with anaerobic sludge

 using various carbon sources at COD/N ratio of 13 -15; while no accumula tion of nitrite occurs 
with methanol, 14%, 70% and 86% nitrite accumulated with acetic acid, glycerol and lactic acid, 
respectively. Overall the above studies showed the impact of carbon source type and COD:N ratio 
on nitrite accumulation . However , in all the studies , the observed nitrite accumulation was 
relatively lower.  
Mohan et al., 2016  examined the de nitrification of high strength nitrate -wastewater (700 -2710 
mgNO 3-N/L) at various COD/N ratios (1.5, 2, 3). The study showed 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% 
nitrite accumulation at nitrate concentrations of 677, 1354, 2031 and 2710 mg/L, respectively. 
These results  indicate that there is a prorated increase in nitrite accumulation with the increase of 
initial nitrate concentration, whereas no direct relation between COD/N and nitrite accumulation. 
It was also found the optimum SDNR of 19.85  mgNO 3-N/mgVSS -d and 8.76 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -
d (SDNR2 NO2-nitrite denitrification after complete nitrate exhaustion ) at COD/N of 1.5, the higher 
the nitrate concentration, the slower the denitrification from nitrite.   
Several authors studied the impact of pH, oxygen level and free nitrous acid inhibition on PDN. 
(Qian et al., 2019)  studied the effect of pH of 5, 7, 9, along with COD/N of 3  with acetate (90 
mgCOD/L and 30mgNO 3-N/L) on PDN in 3 -SBRs. The authors obtained 57% nitrite accumulation 
at a pH of 9 higher than a t pH of 7 (38%) and 5 (21%). The higher nitrite accumulation at pH of 9 
was due to a difference between nitrate denitrification rate and nitrite denitrification (21.2 ˃9.5 
mg/L -hr), while lower difference at pH of 5 (17.3 ˃13.4 mg/L -hr) and pH of 7 (17.2 ˃11 mg/L -
hr). J. Zhao et al., 2019  conducted batch tests at various nitrite and nitrate concentrations of 5 -35 
mgNO 3-N/L, 7.5 -17.5 mgNO 2-N/L, and variou s NO 2/NO 3 ratios, it was found that when initial 
nitrite concentration was 12.5 and 17.5 with NO 2/NO 3 ratios of 1, nitrite accumulated to 21 and 
31, respectively, suggesting that nitrite concentration of  15mgN/L causes FNA inhibition which 
slows nitrite -SDNR and leads to nitrite accumulation. Though FNA inhibition slows both nitrite 
and nitrate SDNR, nitrite -SDNR was more affected. In addition to the above, the dissolved oxygen 
(DO) can inhibit nitrate and nitrite denitrification (Eddy et al., 2014)  and can lead t o nitrite 
accumulation. Oh & Silverstein, 1999a  examined the effect of DO by aerating the SBR for the first 
80 min (COD/N of 5.4) , and the air wa s then shut off for the remaining react ion period (660 
minu tes). In order to compare the effect of the dissolved oxygen, during the second step (660 
minutes), one SBR was operated at DO of 0.0 mg/L, while a second SBR was set at DO of 0.8  
  117 
 mg/L. Results showed both systems accumulate nitrite but  at different COD /N ratios. In the 
absence of DO, the SDNR NO3 increased from 0.55 to 0.82 mgN/mgVSS -d with a decrease in 
COD/N from 5.4 – 8.1 to 2.7 , whereas in the SBR of 0.8 mg DO/L, accumulation only observed 
after oxygen was exhausted entirely  and high COD/N of 5.4 -8.1, the SDNR was found to be 0.8 
mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d.  
More recent researches started to emphasize employing the anammox process through P DN 
pathway for mainstream wastewater treatment. The literature on domestic wastewater 
concentrations is summarized in Table 5.1. Campolong et al., 2019  combined deammonification 
and partial denitrification in 2hr -RT- 0.34m3 - tertiary MBBR and was able to obtain nitrite 
accumulation of 91.0 ± 9.0% with glycerol, 89.0 ± 8.3%, with acetate and  74.0 ± 8.4%  with 
methanol. The optimum COD/N ratio was found to be 2.7 for acetate and glycerol but was 3.8 for 
methanol. Campolong o also conducted cost analysis and found that methanol is the cheapest 
($1.23/kgTIN), followed by glycerol ($1.31/kgTIN), and acetate was the most expensive 
($3.28/kgTIN). Another study on partial denitrification -anammox in SBR (2L -8hr-cycle -SBR), 
NH 4-N of 25 mg/L and NO 3-N of 30mg/L (1200mgMLVSS/L, DEAMOX sludge), 97% N 
removal at optimum COD/N of 3  (Cao et al., 2016) . Ji et al., 2020  accumulated 90% of nitrite in a 
partial denitrification/anammox study employing a 5L UASB reactor, feeding domestic 
wastewater collected from the sep tic tank (224.6mgCOD/L, 67.7 mgNH 4-N/L),  with the addition 
of synthetic nitrate solution of 70 -180 mgN/L (COD/N of 3.3). They also employed batch 
experiments at COD/N of 3.0. Similar studies indicated that denitrification from nitrite starts when 
nitrate is wholly exhausted or reached as low as 3 mg/L (Le, Peng et al., 2019 a) and (Le et al., 
2019 b). Most of these studies demonstrated higher nitrite accumulation rates. However, the studies 
did not address why nitrite accumulates during nitrate denitrification.

 Overall  the review of the literature showed the potential of nitrite accumulation through the PDN 
pathway. In most of the earlier studies (1990 to 2015), the accumulated nitrite concentration was 
relatively lower (< 50%). The intent of most of the earlier researc h was basically to study kinetics 
for denitrification from nitrate and to identify factors causing incomplete denitrification, hence use 
that information to minimize nitrite accumulation during nitrate denitrification. However, recent 
studies (2016 -2020) m ostly implement a combined PDN -anammox process and demonstrated 
higher nitrite accumulation. However, nitrite accumulation was not directly observed instead, 
quantified indirectly based on ammonia consumption and nitrate reduction. The recent studies 
indic ated contrasting information behind nitrite accumulation, making the control strategies less 
robust, requiring additional information on PDN processes. One way to clearly understand the 
fundamentals is through a parallel comparison of nitrite versus partia l nitrate denitrification 
process, t o the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of the previous research compared kinetic 
parameters and microbiological composition under this condition . This study provides an 
assessment of denitrification from nitrite and nitrate for the mainstream wastewater with lower 
COD:N ratio and targets to (i) characterize and compare the long -term performance of nitrite 
versus nitrate and partial  denitrification process under varying operating conditions such as 
COD:N and DO level ( ii) compare the COD/N plays on nitrite denitrification and PDN process 
fundamentals including nitrate and nitrite SDNR, SNAR and half -saturation coefficient (iii) 
classify and compare the biomass community structure grown in partial denitrification and 
complete nitrite denitrification reactor and compare the microbial composition with the process 
performance.  
5.2 Materials and Methods  
5.2.1 Bench scale setup and operation  
Two anoxic sequencing batch bioreactors referred herein as SBR1 and SBR2 were setup f or nitrite 
and nitrate denitrification study, respectively (Figure 5 -1). Each reactor had a 12 L working 
volume, equipped with custom made mechanical mixer (ARROW JR4000, 200 rpm) connected to 
a controller to ensure complete mix condition under anoxic envi ronment. The mixer was 
programmed to be turned on during the feed and react phase of the SBR. Each reactor was also 
equipped with influent and effluent pumps (Masterflex, ColePaR, model no: 07528 -10) and acetate 
pump ( Fisher brand, Mini pump, S/N:192057692 ). The two systems were also purged with  
  120 
 nitrogen gas (304 CF, 2400 PSIG, 99.998% purity ) during the 10 minutes influent feed cycle and 
during the first 5 minutes of the react cycle for a total 15 minutes/cycle, to maintain an anoxic 
condition that was de monstrated through daily dissolved oxygen (DO)  measurement inside the 
bioreactors. In addition to the reactors, the setup had influent and effluent tanks (each 40 L with 
36 L effective volume). The influent and effluent tanks were refilled and emptied eve ry two days, 
respectively. The influent tank was filled with synthetic wastewater composed of 120 mg/L 
NaHCO 3, 100 mg/L KH 2PO 4, 100 mg/L MgSO 4·7H 2O, 100 mg/L CaCl 2, and 1 ml/L of trace 
elements solution. The stock trace element solution were composed of 15, 0.43, 0.24, 0.63, 0.25, 
0.22, 0.19, 0.21, 0.01 and 0.05 g/L ZnSO 4, CoCl 2 , MnCl 2, CuSO 4, Na 2MoO 4, NiCl 2, Na 2SeO 4, 
H3BO 3 and NaWO 4, respectively (Bad ia et al., 2019) .  Sodium nitrite (127 mg/L, 97% purity) and 
sodium nitrate (156.5 mg/L, 97% purity) were added to the SBR1 and SBR2 synthetic wastewater 
solution, respectively, to obtain a concentration of 25 mg/L. At the beginning of the feed sequence , 
in addition to the synthetic wastewater, a 10 mL of sodium acetate solution was also directly 
pumped to each bioreactor for one minute to achieve 50 mgCOD/L in each bioreactor. The sodium 
acetate solution was prepared by dissolving  40 g of CH 3COONa (97%  powder purity) in one litre 
of DI water. Accordingly, the COD/N ratio for both bioreactors was maintained at about 2, which 
is typically considered to be a low COD /N ratio (Le et al., 2019 b).   
The SBRs were operated for 126 days at solids retention time (SRT) of  41 and 31 days for nitrite 
and nitrate (SBR1 and SBR2), respectively. The bioreactor was operated at room temperature  (25 
C0).  The SBRs (SBR1 and SBR2) cycle length was 480 min (3 cycles per day) with 10 -min feed, 
1-min sodium acetate feed, 430 -min react phase under complete mix anoxic conditions, 30 -min 
settling, and 10 -min decanting time. The fill was around 50% of th e SBR volume; in each cycle, 
6 L was decanted and replaced with 6 L of feed, corresponding to a daily feed flow of 18 L. At the 
end of the long term continuous study at COD /N ratio of 2, the COD/N in SBR1 and SBR2 was 
changed sequentially to study the effe ct of the COD/N on complete and partial nitrite 
denitrification., Table 5.1 shows the COD concentration employed during the sequential COD:N 
study, while nitrite and nitrate were not changed, the COD /N ratio were varied by varying the COD 
concentration. Th ese ratios varied between 3 -25 for nitrite and 1 -10 for nitrate to examine partial 
denitrification during nitrate denitrification.

 5.2.2 Batch tests  
The specific denitrification rate (SDNR) is a critical kinetics parameter used for the sizing of a 
denitrification reactor. The half -saturation concentration (K N) has a direct effect on the 
denitrification rate; according to the Monod kinetics, the SDNR is inversely related to the K N, as 
shown by the switching function N/(K N+N). At higher K N, the SDNR is significantly lower ; 
however, a lower K N does not affect the SDNR, and the switching func tion will be approximately 
equal to 1. In order to obtain the half -saturation concentration of nitrite (K N), the SDNR from 
nitrite with acetate was obtained by varying the nitrite concentration using a series of offline batch 
kinetic tests , and the K N  was calculated as per equation 5-6 (section 5.3.5.3). The tests were 
conducted at relatively higher COD concentrations (unlimited -carbon source) and with low nitrite 
concentration (limited -nitrite concentration), respectively. The batch kinetic studies were 
conducted using five -1-L flasks referred herein as B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5. Each test was 
conducted for four hours using the acetate -nitrite -acclimatized biomass collected from the SBR1 
after concentrating by centrifugation (10 min at 3000 rpm) and subsequen tly resuspending to the 
desired 1000 mg/L MLSS concentration (Table 5 -3).

5.2.3 Sampling and Analysis  
Influent and effluent samples of the SBRs were collected two to three times a week and analyzed 
for total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), total COD (TCOD), soluble 
COD (SCOD), ammonia (NH 3), nitrite (NO 2-), nitrate (NO 3-), total phosphorus (TP), and soluble 
phosphorus (SP). Sterile 0.45 µm membrane filter papers (VWR International, Canada) were used 
for filtration of the samples for SCOD, NH 3, NO 2- and NO 3- analysis and 1.2 µm filters were used 
for TSS and VSS analyses in accordance with the Standard Methods ( APHA et al., 2005 ). HACH 
methods were used to measure total phosphorous (Method 10127), ammonia (Method 10031), total 
nitrogen (Method 10072), nitrite (Method 8153), nitrate (Method 10020) and COD (Method  
  123 
 8000).  The DO, pH, and ORP in the reactor were monitored using Atlas Scientific Sensors. For 
the cyclic and batch study, grab samples were collected every 15 minutes during the length of each 
test. The high -frequency sampling enabled us to capture the process dynami cs and understand the 
nitrite and nitrate denitrification process fundamentals.   
The SBRs were fed with acetate from a one -litre separate tank; therefore, the residual bioreactor 
COD and fed COD concentration were analyzed by taking and analyzing samples from the SBR 
at time zero of the react phase (after feeding acetate). The initial bioreactor concentration was 
determined by taking into account the concentrations before and after feeding (equation 5-1). The 
influent COD  was further estimated by taking th e bioreactor COD concentration at time zero of 
the react phase, the COD concentration before feeding (effluent from the previous cycle), and the 
exchange volume into consideration (equation 5-1). In this equation, the COD equivalent of nitrite 
was subtract ed to maintain COD primarily related to organic carbon.

5.2.4 Microbial analys is  
The microbial analysis was conducted to discern the denitrifying microbial population composition 
and relative abundance within the nitrite versus nitrate denitrifier bioreactors. Duplicate sludge 
samples were collected from the SBRs (after3 months of oper ation) and submitted to a molecular 
research DNA LAB (Shallowater, TX, USA). The samples were analyzed using the MiSeq 
sequencing method under bTEFAP. The 16S rRNA gene V4 variable -region PCR primers 515/806 
were used in a 30 –35 PCR with the HotStarTaq Plu s Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, USA) under 94 °C 
for 3 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 minute after  
  124 
 final elongation at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The PCR end -product was examined in 2% of agarose gel 
after amplificati on in order to assure successful amplification. Several samples in equal 
proportions were pooled together (e.g., 50 samples) depending on their molecular weight and DNA 
concentrations. Calibrated Ampure XP beads were then used to purify the pooled samples,  and the 
Illumina DNA library was prepared by using the purified PCR product.  Sequencing was performed 
at MR DNA ( www.mrdnalab.com ), Shallowater, TX, USA) on a MiSeq following the 
manufacturer’s guidelin es. Sequence data were processed using the MR DNA analysis pipeline 
(MR DNA, Shallowater, TX, USA). To sum -up, sequences were joined, depleted of barcodes, then 
sequences <150bp removed, sequences with vague base calls removed. Sequences were denoised, 
OTU s generated, and chimeras removed. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined by 
clustering at a 3% divergence (97% similarity). Final OTUs were taxonomically classified using 
BLASTn against a curated database derived from RDPII and NCBI 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov , http://rdp.cme.msu.edu ). Finally, the classification of the microbial 
communities was made based on the % relative abundance (RA%) ; micro bes with RA greater than 
1% were considered for the classification.  
5.3 Results and Discussion  
5.3.1 SBRs denitrification performance overview  
The SBRs were operated for 126 days in which the biomass showed acclimatization after two 
weeks. The average influent and effluent quality parameters are summarized in Table 5.4 and 
shown in Figures 5 -2 a to d. The average values were calculated using the last 40 days of data that 
showed stable performance. The average effluent TSS and VSS from nitrite SB R1 were 15.2±3.8 
and 6.5±2.07 mg/L with a range of 10 -23 and 4 -8 mg/L, respectively, while the average effluent 
TSS and VSS from nitrate SBR2 were 22.8±3.7 and 13±2 mg/L with a range of 19 -30 and 10 -15 
mg/L, respectively. The effluent TSS (VSS) concentrati on differences were mainly due to the 
difference of the type of microorganisms grown in SBR1 and SBR2 (as discussed in section 3.4) 
that resulted in different settling characteristics as indicated by the SVI for SBR1 (19 mL/g) vs. 
SBR2 (96 mL/g). Correspon dingly, t he average MLSS (MLVSS) in SBR1 was 5495 (2392) mg/L 
with an average SRT of 47 days; however, the concentration was lower in SBR2 with MLSS 
(MLVSS) concentration of 2338 (1228) mg/L and 31 days SRT (Table 5.4). The decline in SRT 
and observed decr ease in MLSS concentration in SBR2 was due to poor settling and biomass loss  
  125 
 associated with the type of microbial structure grown in each bioreactor (section 5.3.4). A  decrease 
in the MLVSS/MLSS ratio from 0.6 to 0.43 was observed in SBR1 and from 0.6 to 0.52 in SBR2. 
The main reason for the MLVSS/MLSS decrease is the accumulation of fixed non -volatile matter 
such as calcium carbonate that was supplied with synthetic wastewater, which quickly settled at 
the bottom of SBRs. The accumulation was relatively h igher in SBR1 because of the longer SRT.   
The pH and ORP for influent effluent in both SBRs were monitored to ensure anoxic conditions 
during the study. The influent pH for both SBRs remained constant, ranging from 6.9 -7.2 with an 
average value of 7.1 thr oughout the study.  However, the effluent pH increased mainly due to the 
alkalinity production during the denitrification from nitrite (Badia et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2017; 
Du et al.,  2016; Peng et al., 2006) . SBR1 was setup to denitrify nitrite as an electron acceptor in 
which 3 electrons were transferred from nitrite to nitrogen gas during the bioreaction; thus, the 
average bioreactor pH was 8.45. However, SBR2 was partially denit rifying nitrate in which only 
2 electrons were transferred during the bioreaction; therefore, SBR2’s effluent pH was 7.5 (Table 
5-4). The increase of pH that occurred during the PDN -cycle (SBR2) was mainly due to the 
dissociation of sodium acetate (carbon source) (Cao et al., 2017) . The difference between the 
oxidation -reduction potential (ORP) for influent and effluent, Table 5 -4, showed higher -ve △ORP 
difference for SBR1 ( -126 mv) than SBR2 ( -105 mv). The increase of △ORP in SBR2 was mainly 
due to the portion of nitrite that was fully denitrified (26% of N r emoval).   
The average influent acetate COD varied from 43.3 to 82.9 mg/L (average 59±21 mg/L) for SBR1 
and from 33.3 to 55.5 mg/L (average 47±9.7) for SBR2 (Figures 5 -2a and c), respectively. Most 
COD was consumed in SBR1 for the nitrite denitrification ( 95% N removal efficiency) with 
average effluent of 3.7 mgCOD/L (94% COD removal efficiency), while the average effluent of 
SBR2 (6.8 mg/L) was higher than SBR2 with 85% removal efficiency. The NO 2–N fed to the 
SBR1 varied between 23.7 and 27.3 mg/L with an  average of 25±1.1 mg/L (Figure 5 -2b, Table 5 -
4), and the influent NO 3–N fed to the SBR2 varied between 25 and 28.6 mg/L with an average of 
28±1 mg/L (Figure 5 -2 d, Table 5 -4). The nitrite effluent showed variability until day 80 when the 
final effluent re ached to less than 1 mgN/L (Figure 5 -2 b), which matches with stable effluent 
COD (soluble COD) for the same period in SBR1. The △COD/ △N was found to be 2.5, which 
was calculated from Table 5 -4 with consideration of a 2 mgN/L consumed for biomass synthesis . 
In comparison, a △COD/ △N calculated from the yield equation 5-4 (Section 5.3.5)  ( △COD/ △N  
  126 
 =1.72/(1 -1.42Y)) was equal to 3, which implies that a portion of denitrification was due to 
endogenous respiration COD. In SBR2, NO 3-N was not completely removed du ring the first 80 
days of operation (Figure 5 -2 d), and early on, NO 2-N accumulation was not observed except for 
some days (12 mgN/L -day 35, 5 -9mgN/L -between days 55 -75). However, during the last 40 days 
of the SBR2 operation, stable effluent NO 2-N, and NO 3-N concentration with 26% N removal 
efficiency was observed. The average effluent NO 2-N  accumulated at the end of the cycle for the 
last 40 days of operation exceeded 11±2 mg/L (Figure 5 -2 d, Table 5 -4), which indicates that PDN 
can be maintained with CO D/N and DO control. Additional discussion on COD/N and DO control 
is presented in sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3.

 5.3.2 COD/N and DO impact on the long term nitrite and nitrate denitrification  
Both SBRs were operated at the COD/N ratio of 2 (Figure 5 -2 a to d), with nitrite and nitrate 
concentration of 25 mgN/L in the influent for  126 days. A high nitrite removal efficiency was 
obtained (more than 80%) in the first week of operation. However, due to high DO intrusion from 
the influent tank (1 mg/L in the bioreactor and 6 mg/L in the influent tank) or at times due to low 
COD/N ratio  during some instances (between days 11 to 70), the nitrite removal efficiency was 
not stable. During most of the operation period, the SBRs DO was maintained less than 0.5 mg/L 
by purging it with nitrogen. A similar reduction in denitrification was also r eflected in SBR2 since 
both SBRs were purged from one nitrogen -cylinder (Figure 5 -3a).  During increased DO levels, 
the specific denitrification rate (SDNR) decreases according to the DO inhibition -switching 
function (K o//DO+ K o/), (where K o/ is the inhibi tion concentration (ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 mgDO/L 
Oh (Oh & Silverstein, 1999b) ), and denitrification from nitrate/nitrite would be negatively affected 
if it is higher than 0.5 mgDO/L , (Eddy et al., 2014) . Lower COD/N also reduced nitrite removal 
efficiency due to the lack of carbon source, as 3 electrons are donated from the carbon source 
(sodium acetate) to nitrite (electron acceptor) to produce nitrogen gas. Theoretically, each mgNO 2-
N requ ires 1.72 mgCOD to be converted to nitrogen gas divided by 0.4 for the yield consideration 
(1-Y), which increases the COD/N needed to more than 4; therefore, one of the reasons for not 
having full nitrite denitrification could be the lower COD/N of 2 (Figu re 5-3 a). However, Figure 
5-3a also clearly showed that with a slight COD/N increase to 2.5, the nitrite removal efficiency 
was more than 95% with an average final effluent NO 2-N concentration of 0.69 mg/L (80 10 120 
days). A COD/N ratio of 2.5 is still l ower than the theoretical 4, and it is believed that the higher 
removal could also be due to consistent DO that was below 0.5 mg/L and due to endogenous 
respiration COD.  
Similarly, in denitrification from nitrate, there were disturbances in the DO, and th e bioreactor DO 
reach as high as 1 mgDO/L between days 10 to 70, which inhibited denitrification from nitrate and 
nitrite and reduced the SDNR.  Comparatively, the COD/N was relatively stable, with an average 
of 1.8 except some days with disturbance showin g COD /N less than 1. During the initial 80 days, 
the NOx -N removal ranged from 15 to 92%, and the lower removals were associated with higher 
DOs (1 mg/L) and the higher removals with lower DOs (0.3 mg/L). During the last 40 days of 
operation (DO˂0.5 mg/L, COD/N of 1.8), the nitrate concentration was reduced from 28 mgN/L 
to 5 mgN/L (93% NO 3-N removal). However, most of the nitrate was accumulated as nitrite (up  
  129 
 to 68%), and approximately 25% nitrite is denitrified. At this point, it was not clear why the ni trite 
was not accumulated during the first 80 days of operation. It is suspected that, during the first 80 
days, it was possible that nitrate was partially denitrified; however, due to the high DO level in the 
bioreactor, the nitrite might be further oxidi zed by nitrite -oxidizing bacteria (NOB), forming 
nitrate as an end product. Oxidation of nitrite to nitrate was also observed coincident with higher 
DOs (0.5 to 1 mg/L) during the first 80 days of SBR1 operation (Figure 5 -2 a and 5 -3 a). 
Considering the la st 40 days of SBR2 data (Figure 5 -3 b), it can be observed that a 1.8 COD /N did 
not allow for complete denitrification from nitrate because of the deficiency of the number of 
electrons. Five electrons are needed and donated from acetate to the electron acceptor nitrate, and 
theoretically, each mgNO 3-N requires 2.86 mgCOD to be converted to nitrogen as divided by 0.4 
for the yield consideration (1 -Y), which increase the ratio to 7. Understanding the COD/N ratio 
impact on a long term base is diffi cult due to the additional COD from endogenous decay. Thus a 
cyclic test was performed inside the SBRs to understand the impact of acetate COD/N ratio on the 
corresponding nitrite accumulation rates, nitrate denitrification rates, and nitrite denitrificati on 
rates, and the results are discussed below.

 5.3.3 Effect of COD/N on partial denitrification  
Various COD/N ratios were conducted in SBR 1 and SBR2 to study the effect of COD/N ratio on 
the denitrification nitrate and i dentify the optimum COD/N to maximize nitrite accumulation. 
Partial denitrification of nitrate was reported to depend on several factors (Ji et al., 2018; Peng et 
al., 2006; Pishgar et al., 2019) . A stu dy by Akunna et al., 1993  illustrated  that the pathway during 
denitrification from nitrate with volatile fatty acids such as acetate is nitrogen gas, while the 
pathway with glucose is dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. The reason for this is that 
acetate enters the tricarboxylic aci d cycle (TCA) directly, whereas glucose will first Glycolysis 
before entering the TCA cycle. As a result, PDN may not be observed on some carbon sources. 
However, the occurrence of PDN during processes that made use of volatile fatty acids as carbon 
source s were not conclusive. Some researchers obtained PDN at a lower COD/N ratio (Ji et al., 
2018) , higher COD/N ratio (Shi et al., 2019) , at a higher pH (Peng et al., 2006; Qian et al., 2019; 
Shi et al., 2019) , carbon source (Le et al., 2019 b), and type of seeding sludge (Cao et al., 2013; 
Chen et al., 2016) . So the intent here is to understand the PDN process better and generate 
fundamental knowledge to aid in developing control strategies.  
Figures 5 -4 a to e shows cyclic test results in SBR2 at COD/N ratios of 1.1, 1.8, 2.7,  6.7 and 9.8, 
respectively, each test lasted 7.5 hours and samples were collected every 15 minutes for the first 4 
hours. The data were also used to calculate (i) the specific denitrification rate from nitrate 
(SDNR NO3), (ii) specific nitrite accumulation rate (SNAR), (iii) the first specific denitrification 
rate from nitrite (SDNR  NO2-1), (iv) the second specific denitrification rate from nitrite (SDNR  NO2-
2) and (v) the nitrate to nitrite transformation rate (NTR%) . The SDNR NO3 (SDNR NO2) was 
calculated by dividing the slope of the nitrate (nitrite) concentration removed over time (mg 
N/L/day)  by the MLVSS concentration.  The SNARs followed zero -order kinetics and were 
calculated by dividing the slope of the line of nitrite concentration accumu lated during the SBR2 
anoxic cycles normalized to the time -day (mgNO 2–N/L/day) and divided by the MLVSS 
concentration. The nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio (NTR%) was calculated according to the 
following formula  (Shi et al., 2019) : 
NTR% = (NO2−N)accmulated −(NO2−N)0
(NO3−N)0−(NO3−N)max .acc∗100                                                                                 (2)              
  131 
 Where NO 2-Naccumulated represents the maximum nitr ite accumulation, NO 2-N0 and NO 3-N0 
represent nitrite and nitrate concentration at time zero and NO 3-Nmac. acc represents nitrate 
concentration at nitrite maximum accumulation.  
At very low COD/N of 1.1 there was a slight nitrite accumulation, nitrite incre ased from 3.6 mgN/L 
to 5.7 mgN/L with NTR (nitrite to nitrate transformation ratio) of 17.1% (Figure not shown here). 
The kinetic rates SDNR NO3, SNAR and SDNR  NO2-1 were meagre 0.078, 0.068 and 0.01 
mgN/mgVSS -d (Table 5 -5), respectively, and SDNR  NO2-2 was  zero because there was not enough 
carbon for further denitrification from nitrate and nitrite. At slightly higher COD/N of 1.8, nitrite 
accumulated to 11.7 mgN/L with NTR of 68% while nitrate reduced from 18.1 mgN/L to 9.3 
mg/N/L after 90 minutes from the cycle start time (Figure 5 -4 a). Beyond this point of time, both 
nitrate and nitrite were further reduced to 9.0 mgN/L and 10.2 mgN/L, respectively. These minor 
reductions can be attributed to endogenous respiration since COD was very low 4.2 mg/L at the 
maximum nitrite accumulation, which can also be observed from the NO X-N profile at 90 minutes 
(Figure 5 -4a). Relatively higher kinetic rates were also observed; the SDNR NO3, SNAR and  SDNR  
NO2-1 were 2.119, 0.884 and 1.27 mgN/mgVSS -d, respectively (Table 5 -5).  
At COD/N of 2.7, the amount of nitrite accumulated increased from 5.4 mg/L to 16.2 mgN/L with 
NTR of 79.4% while nitrate reduced from 15.7 mgN/L to 2.1 mgN/L at 240 minutes from cycle 
start time. After 240 minutes, while the nitra te concentration remained unchanged at 2.1 mgN/L, 
the nitrite was reduced to 14.7 mgN/L, which can be attributed to the utilization of carbon source 
from endogenous respiration. This can be confirmed by the remaining COD of 3.6 mg/L at the 
maximum nitrite accumulation and can also be observed from NO X-N rate at 150 minutes (Figure 
5-4 b).  While the SDNR NO3 remained comparable to the 1.8 COD:N test (2.127mgN/mgVSS -d), 
the SNAR increased to 1.62 mgN/mg VSS -d while the SDNR  NO2-1 decreased to 0.465 
mgN/mgVSS -d (Table 5 -5). 
At high COD/N of 6.7, while nitrite increased from 4.5 to 14 mgN/L (maximum accumulation) 
with NTR of 81.4%, nitrate reduced from 18.1 mgN/L to 6.3 mgN/L, and this accumulation 
occurred within 15 minutes from the cycle start time (Figure 5 -4 c). After 60 minutes from cycle 
start time, nitrate and nitrite were further reduced to 1.3 and 6 mgN/L, respectively, and COD was 
consumed entirely. Beyond this point time (60 minutes), the nitrite reduced to 2.9 mg/L; however, 
the carbon source was supp lied through endogenous respiration (Figure 5 -4 c).  This result is  
  132 
 significant, showing that with an increase in COD /N ratio, the maximum accumulation happens 
very fast, and we may have higher NTR but wasn’t captured because samples were collected every 
15 minutes. The SDNR NO3 slightly increased to 2.61 mgN/mgVSS -d, SNAR increased 2.127 
mgN/mg VSS -d and SDNR  NO2-1 almost remained unchanged 0.483 mgN/mgVSS -d, due to the 
availability of carbon source and a 0.83mgN/mgVSS -d  SDNR  NO2-2 was observed(Table 5. 5). At 
the highest COD/N of 9.8, nitrite accumulated from 4.8 to 15.3 mgN/L with NTR of 73%, nitrate 
was then reduced from 16.1 mgN/L to 1.7 mgN/L, same as above (COD/N of 6.7) this 
accumulation also occurred within the first 15 minutes from the cycle start. It is suspected that t he 
actual NTR would be much higher if the sampling period were shorter than 15 minutes. Nitrate 
and nitrite are then reduced to 0.7 and 1.5 mgN/L after 45 minutes from cycle start (COD of  44 
mg/L), respectively (Figure 5 -4 d). The SD NR NO3 slightly decreased to 2.16 mgN/mgVSS -d , and  
SNAR decreased to 1.575 mgN/mg VSS -d, and SDNR  NO2-1 almost remained unchanged 0.585 
mgN/mgVSS -d, and this is due to the availability of carbon source SDNR  NO2-2 increased to 1.04 
mgN/mgVSS -d (Table 5. 5).   
Previous research by Le et al., 2019  stated that maximum nitrite accumulation occurred at nitrate 
concentration of  3 mgN/L. Fundamentally, t he minimum nitrate concentration in the final effluent 
is directly affected by K NO3, which was reported as 6.9 mg/L by Cao et al., 2017 . Thus in the case 
of high in itial nitrate concentration , maximum nitrite accumulation can happen at a high remaining 
nitrate concentration because the switching function will be 1 (NO 3 - N/(K NO3  + NO 3 - N) =1).   The 
cyclic studies (Figures 5 -4 a to d), clearly uncover that nitrite accumulation is not affected by 
higher levels of COD/N ratio; actually, accumulation occurs when COD/N ≥ 2.7. Therefore, in 
order to accumulate more than 80% nitrite, the threshold COD/N rat io has to be higher than 2.7. 
Moreover, SNAR (2.127 mgN/mgVSS -d) needs to be maximized to accumulate nitrite to higher 
than 80%, and SDNR  NO2-1 to be minimized to a lower value (0.46 mgN/mgVSS -d), which is 
usually reduced due to the competitive inhibition between nitrite and nitrate.  Moreover, a lower 
COD/N ratio of 2.5 to 3 can be used to control further denitrification from nitrite. However, the 
analysis showed higher NTR at COD/N of 6.7 , but nitrite was further reduced due to the 
availability of the car bon source, which can be controlled by either reducing the retention time 
and/or inhibiting the nitrite reductase (NiR) enzyme.  All the cyclic studies in SBR2 showed that 
despite the COD:N ratio, nitrate denitrification in SBR2 occurs at a much higher rat e compared to 
nitrite denitrification. This goes against the denitrification thermodynamics. The ΔG for nitrate  
  133 
 denitrification ( -93.23 Kj/e-) is lower than the ΔG for nitrite denitrification ( -71.67 Kj/e-) (Eddy et 
al., 2014) , which indicates that under carbon li miting condition, the nitrite denitrification is 
favoured over nitrate denitrification thermodynamically. However, this study clearly showed that 
this is not the case, which is further clarified by comparing the kinetics and microbiological 
makeup of the n itrite (SBR1) versus nitrate (SBR2) reactors. Moreover, the analysis illustrates that 
△COD/ △NO 3-N of 4.3 and 4.1 at COD/NO 3-N of 6.7 and 9.8, respectively. This indicates that 
COD/NO 3-N could be further optimized in the range of 4 -4.5.

5.3.4 Bacterial identification  
In order to distinguish between the nitrite and nitrate denitrifiers community diversity and a 
structure, the taxonomic analysis was conducted.  Previous studies have been conducted to 
investigate the community structure for complete and partial denitrific ation of nitrate (Andalib et 
al., 2018a; Du et al., 2016; Miao et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2019; Y. Yang et al., 2018) . However, 
these studies did not delineate if there is any microbial composition difference between a process 
that was unde r complete nitrite denitrification vs partial denitrification.  
5.3.4.1 Phylum level classification  
The relative taxonomic microbial communities were studied up to the phylum level for both SBR1 
and SBR2 (Supporting document: Figure SD -5-1 a and b). The most identified predominant 
phylum was Proteobacteria  phylum, which was found to be 79% in SBR1 (nitri te) and 69.3% in 
SBR2 (nitrate).  The Proteobacteria  phylum is typically found in municipal wastewater treatment 
facilities and responsible for denitrification  (Du et al., 2017) . Du et al., 2017 , who studied partial 
denitrification from nitrate,  reported a comparable 65% RA of the Proteobacteria  phylum. The 
decrease in Proteobacteria  phylum RA  in  SBR2 could be related to the lower available carbon 
source for nitrate (5 electrons needed) than nitrite (3 electrons needed). The second -highest relative 
abundance phylum in SBR1 was Acidobacteria with RA of 7.1%, the Acidobacteria was identified 
as the third dominant phylum in SBR2 (2.4%). Most bacteria in this phylum grow at a lower pH , 
and under aerobic conditions however, some are facultative heterotopic denitrifiers (Eichorst et 
al., 2018) . The Bacteroidetes  was the se cond for SBR2 (19%) and the third for SBR1 (6%), and  
  135 
 also classified as facultative heterotrophic denitrifiers and found in an anoxic denitrifying 
environment (Xia et al., 2019) .    
The next taxonomic classification is the class level (supporting document, Figure -SD 5 .2a (SBR1) 
and Figure -SD 5.2b (SBR2)), Betaproteobacteria  class showed to dominate the denitrification 
process with the highest relative abundance of 67.5 and 50.4% for SBR1 and SBR2, respectively.  
It was interesting to observe the presence of Nitrospira  with a relative abundance of 1.8% and 
0.31% in SBR1 and SBR2, respectively which indicate the existence of nitrite -oxidizing bacteria 
(NOB), which can be related to the intrusion of oxygen and an increase in DO level to 1 mg/L 
while nitrogen cyli nder ran out of gas. The presence of Nitorspira confirmed the decline in nitrite 
and nitrate removal efficiency, and the lack of nitrite accumulation during the first 80 days of 
operation was associated with NOx -N oxidation. An overall comparison of the mi crobial 
composition in SBR1 and SBR2 showed that there was no substantial difference in composition 
and relative abundance differences on a phylum and class level.   
5.3.4.2 Microbial genus and species  
In general, most denitrifying bacteria are heterotroph ic because they require organic carbon source, 
which is needed for cell growth and nitrate reduction, (X. Xu et al., 2020) . During denitrification 
from nitrite, a nitrite may accumulate due to nitrite reductase (Nir) inhibition, lag in synthesis, and 
nitrate reductase (NaR) inhibition because nitrite is on t he nitrate denitrification pathway,  
(Andalib et al., 2018a) . (Andalib et al., 2018a)  divided denitrifiers into four groups; (i) Group A: 
reduces NO 3 to NO 2, which lack Nir, (ii) Group B: reduces nitrate to further nitrogen oxides in the 
denitrification pathway (NO 2, NO, N 2O), (iii) Group C: reduces nitrate and nit rite, but with a 
higher nitrite denitrification rate (no nitrite accumulation), and (iv) Group D: reduce nitrate and 
nitrite but with higher nitrate denitrification rate (nitrite accumulation may be observed).  
There were 17 genera identified in SBR1 and 21 in SBR2 with a relative abundance of 1% and 
above. The relative abundance distribution on the genus level is shown in Figure 5 -5 a., and Table 
5-6 shows the classification of the genera level, relative abundance (RA%), class, and phylum 
levels along  with the importance of each genus found in SBR1 and SBR2.  The dominant genus in 
the SBR1(nitrite) was Zoogloea  with a relative abundance of 42.2%, followed by Acidobacterium  
(6.6%), Thauera  (4.5%), and Dokdonella  (2.9%).  However, the genera relative abu ndance 
distribution in SBR2 were utterly different, the Thauera  comes first (10%) followed by Zoogloea   
  136 
 (7.2%), Sterolibacterium  (5.9), Denitratisoma (5.45%), Niastella  (4.87%), Dokdonella  (4.24%), 
Fluviicola  (3.84%), Dechloromonas  (3.47%), Terrimonas  (3.32 %), Methyloversatilis  (2.61%) and 
Lewinell a (2.05%). It can also be observed that the nitrate reactor had a wide range of genera ( 11) 
at 2 to 10% RA, whereas in the case of the nitrite reactor only 4 genera were identified with higher 
RA. Zoogloea  is well known in wastewater treatment for its higher EPS concentration and floc 
formation and often associated with sludge having SVI as low as 19 mL/g (An et al., 2016) . The 
higher relative abundance of Zoogloea  in SBR1 (nitrite denitrifying bioreactor) could indicate that 
this genus may be associated with group C denitrifiers where microbe consisted of higher NiR 
enzyme over NaR enzyme. In this study, the nitrite reactor had also shown good settling 
characterist ics (section 5.3.1), confirming the microbiological and the process data. In comparison, 
the higher Thauera  with a relative abundance of (9.96%) in SBR2 could be attributed to group D, 
which has higher NaR enzymes than NiR enzymes. This is consistent with the observation by Qian 
et al., 2019 . The authors found a relatively higher relative abundance of Thauera at a pH of 9  
(17.04%), but the abundance dropped to 2.21% at a  pH 7. The authors also showed a higher NaR 
enzyme of 8089 hits than NiR enzyme of 2950 hits associated with Thauera  genera. The higher 
NaR enzyme associated with Thauera and Thauera abundance in SBR2 may explain the 
preferential nitrate denitrification but nitrite accumulation in the SBR2 reactor. Z. Xu et al., 2018  
also found RA of Thauera  38% at higher COD/N of 6, showing a RA(%) increase with higher 
carbon source availability. This is in agreement with a previous study by W. Zhou et al., 2017  that 
detected Thauera  in the three bioreactors using thiosulfate (0.38%), sulfide (0.12%), elemental 
sulfur ( most abundant 2.24%) and ethanol (0.17%) as an electron donor in a study of autotrophic 
denitrifiers. McIlroy et al., 2016  reported a high acetate uptake rate with nitrite by Dechloromonas  
genus, which part of their sp ecies belongs to the denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organism 
(DPAO) group. Also, Dokdonella was studied and considered as complete nitrite and nitrate 
denitrifiers in both the oxic and anoxic environment (Du et al., 2017)  and (Pishgar et al., 2019) .  It 
is crystal clear that the microbial community is more diverse in SBR2, where Thauera  has a highest 
relative abundance of 10% followed by  Zoogloea (7.2%) , while SBR1 has  Zoogloea   with a very 
high relative abundance of 42.2% and contains a relatively smaller fraction of Thauera (4.5%) .

 5.3.4.3 Microbial species  
Similar to  the genus, the species level shows a functional classification; hence it was expected to 
observe a difference in the species -level classification.  There were 16 species identified in SBR1 
and 19 in SBR2, with a relative abundance of 1% and above (Figure 5.8). The most common 
species in SBR1 (nitrite) were Zoogloea  Resiniphila  with a relative abundance of 24.5%, followed 
by Zoogloea Ramigera  with a relative abundance of 16.7%. Both of the two species belong to 
Zoogloea  genus and the class of Betaproteobacteria  under the phylum of Proteobacteria . 
However, the relative abundance of these species in nitrate SBR2 was 0.99 and 6% for Zoogloea  
resiniphila  and Zoogloea Ramigera , respectively,  which indicates that Zoogloea Resiniphila  is 
more responsible for the denitrification from nitrite (group C - more NiR). In contrast, Zoogloea 
Ramigera  can denitrify from both electron acceptors (group B, balanced NiR, and NaR). 
Furthermore, the third species in SBR1 is Acidobacterium spp . (6.59%) followed by Dokdonella  
spp. (2.84%), and Thauera  spp. (2.55%).   On the other hand, the most relative abundance in the 
SBR2 (nitrate) was Thauera  spp. (6.5%) which has a higher NaR compared to NiR  enzymes. This 
variation in the enzymes is confirmed by Ma et al., 2017 , who observed a relative a bundance of 
1.23% of Thauera spp ., in association with lower  Nir enzymes (588 hits) than Nar enzymes (5892 
hits) and confirmed by X. Xu et al., 2020 , who observed a 5.7% Thauera Pheny lacetica  in UASB. 
In this current study, the SBR2 reactor that is dominated by the Thauera spp.  showed a lower NO 2-
N removal rate than NO 3-N removal, which, together with a lower COD /N ratio, leads to partial 
denitrification (nitrite accumulation). Therefore, the nitrite accumulated by Thauera  is due to the 
availability of nitrate above KNO3; however, NO 3-N below K NO3, nitrite -denitrifiers starts to reduce 
nitrite by inducing nirS, mRN A increases, and the accumulated nitrite is then reduced. The  second 
species in the SBR2 is  Zoogloea Ramigera  (6%), which is classified in group D as above, 
Sterolibacterium spp . (5.8%) and Denitratisoma spp . (4.8%) all of which are classified under class 
Betaproteobacteria  and phylum of Proteobacteria . While heterotrophic denitrifiers are inhibited 
by high oxygen concentration, Zoogolea Ramigera  can significantly denitrify nitrate at as high as 
8 mgO 2/L, and  the rate could be higher when ammonia exists with high concentrations  (Pishgar et 
al., 2019) ; thus SDNR NO2 could be augmented in the presence of high ammonium concentration 
(Pishgar et al., 2019) . This indicates that Zoogolea , which belongs to the denitrifying glycogen 
accumulating organisms (DGAO) group, uses ammonia for cell growth (assimilation), while 
denitrify nitrate aerobically (nitrate dissimilation) (Pishgar et al., 2019) .   
  140 
  
In conclusion, the bacterial community in SBR1 and SBR2 were acclimatized to denitrify from 
nitrite and nitrate, respectively. The study showed a clear microbial community difference between 
the two reactors that yield a significant difference between the tw o denitrification processes. In 
this study, the change in the microbial community resulted in two complete denitrification patterns,  
high nitrite denitrification in SBR1, whereas higher nitrate denitrification but lower nitrite 
denitrification in SBR2 due  to the diversity of the microbial communities. Moreover, Zoogloea  
and Thauera  genera played a vital role in denitrification from nitrite and nitrate, respectively. For 
complete and partial nitrite denitrification, it would be favourable to analyze NiR and  NaR 
enzymes in SBR1 and SBR2, respectively.

5.3.5 Nitrate versus nitrite denitrification Kinetics  
The kinetics parameters, including denitrifier yield, SDNR, and half -saturation coefficient, were 
compared from a complete nitrite denitrifying (SBR1) and a complete nitrate and partially nitrite 
denitrification (SBR2) system. This information will further  explain the differences between the 
two systems. Also, this knowledge will contribute to model these systems accurately. Currently, 
limited kinetic data is available for such systems; therefore, the conventional modelling practice 
assumes similar kinetic values for NOx -N denitrification.  0510152025

 5.3.5.1 Heterotrophic denitrifier yield ( 𝑌𝐻𝐷) 
The heterotrophic denitrifier yield (Y HD) is defined as the biomass produced per the COD removed 
or nitrite (nitrate) - nitrogen removed. Determining the rate of biomass pro duced in the system 
allows us to determine the wasted biomass, and the parameter is used for process modelling to size 
the denitrifying bioreactor, estimate effluent quality, and also used to determine other kinetic 
parameters. The heterotrophic denitrifie r yield (Y HD – mgVSS/mgCOD) was calculated from the 
long term SBR 1 and SBR 2 data as per the equations below (Badia et al., 2019) , (Bill et al., 2009)  
and Equation 9 by Y. Mokhayeri et al., 2009 : 
YHD (NO2 )=(1− 1.72 △NO2−N
△COD)/1.42                                                                                     (5-2) 
YHD (NO3 −NO2 )=(1− 1.14△NO2−N
△COD)/1.42                                                                              (5-3) 
YHD (NO3 −N2)=(1− 2.86△NO3−N
△COD)/1.42                                                                                (5-4) 
Equations 2 -3 can be rewritten for SBR2 as:  
Y
HD (NO3 −N2)=(1−(1.14 NO2−N produced  +1.71 NO2−N removed ) +2.86 NO3−N removed )/ ∆𝐶𝑂𝐷 )

                                                                                                                                                (5-5)  
Where △NO 2-N represent the nitrite removed in the SBR1 (equation 5-2), 1.14 △NO 3-N represent 
nitrate remov ed to nitrite in SBR2 (equation 5-3), △COD represent the COD removed in the 
respective SBR1 or SBR2 bioreactors (equations 5-3 to 5-5), the NO 2-N produced represents the 
SNAR, the NO 2-N removed represents SDNR1 NO2 + SDNR2 NO2, and the NO 3-N removed 
represen ts the SDNR NO3. The kinetic data followed zero -order kinetics, and the SDNRs ( △NO 2-N 
and △NO 3-N) were calculated by dividing the removed nitrite in the SBR1 and the removed nitrate 
in SBR2 normalized to the cycle time and MLVSS concentration. The substrate utilization rate, 
SSURs ( △COD)  were calculated by dividing the removed COD concentration during  the SBR 
anoxic cycle normalized to the cycle time -day (mgCOD/L/day) and the MLVSS concentration.  
The heterotrophic denitrifier yield (Y HD) in the SBR was estimated after determining the substrate 
utilized in both SBRs or calculating the slope of the SDNR/ SSUR ( △N/△COD) for each data 
point multiplied by the stoichiometric coefficient, 1.72 for SBR1 and SBR2, and substituting the 
values in Equation 3 for SBR1 and Equation 5-4 for SBR2. The Y HD (SBR1 -nitrite) was found to 
be 0.3 ±0.1 mgVSS/mgTCOD (Figure SD 5 -3 a), and 0.34 ±0.13 mgVSS/mgTCOD for SBR2 
(PDN) (Figure SD 5 -3 b). Cherchi et al., 2009 , Yongmei Zhang et al., 2016  and Yalda Mokhayeri  
  142 
 et al., 2008  reported a yield of 0.35, 0.38 and 0.42 mgVSS/mgCOD, respectively during complete 
nitrate denitrification studies with ac etate as carbon source. Peng et al., 2007  estimated yield of 
0.4, 0.42, and 0.65 mgVSS/mgCOD for methanol, ethanol, and acetate, respectively. Other yield 
studies by (Guven et al., 2018) , who  reported a yield coefficient of 0.45 mgVSS/mgCOD for a 
mixture of acetate, propionate, ethanol, and glucose. Bernat et al., 2015  reported a daily variation 
on yield (0.27 -0.44), which depends on the daily operation cond itions and COD/N ratio. All 
literature yield data are based on full nitrate denitrification; however, the yield estimated in the 
current study (during PDN) is in good agreement with literature.  According to the following PDN 
stoichiometric equation (half -reaction stoichiometry below), the yield would be 0.13 
mgVSS/mgCOD, which occurred due to PDN only. However, the PDN calculated yield in this 
study was due to a combination of full denitrification SDNR NO3, SDNR NO3 -NO2, SNAR (specific 
nitrite accumulation ra te), and SDNR1(first specific denitrification rate from nitrite).

There is limited literature on the nitrite yield with acetate. (Badia et al., 2019)  (Chapter 3) reported 
a yield of 0.51 mgVSS/mgCOD  during offline testing of nitrite and acetate, which was much 
higher than the current yield data. The higher yield can be attributed to the use of unacclimatized 
sludge to acetate; rather, the sludge was acclimatized to MWW in the long -term process. Altho ugh 
there was not much difference yield between the complete denitrification from nitrate in the above 
literature, the sludge produced in the denitrification from nitrite and for PDN is lower due to less 
COD consumed (3 electron transferred for nitrite and  2 electron transferred for PDN).  
5.3.5.2 Effect of COD/N on nitrate and nitrite SDNR during SBR cyclic tests  
Various COD/N ratios were conducted in SBR1 and SBR2 to study the effect of COD/N ratio on 
the denitrification from nitrite versus nitrate, find  the optimum SDNR for both nitrite and nitrate, 
and compare the nitrite versus nitrate denitrification rate.  
Figure 5 -7a and Table 5.7 show the effect of COD/N in SBR1 on denitrification from nitrite 
(SDNR) during cyclic tests. The SDNR linearly increased with the increase of COD/N in the range 
of 2.6 -10.1 (COD range 29 -300 mg/L) to a maximum value of 0.69 mgN/mgVSS -d at COD/N of 
10.1 beyond which SDNR declined and dropped to as low as 0.31 mgN/mgVSS -d at COD/N of   
  143 
 25. These findings agreed with (Adav et al., 201 0; Akunna et al., 1992; Badia et al., 2019, 2020; 
S. Ge et al., 2012) . As shown later, the K NO2 (half -saturation coefficient of nitrite) obtained from 
the kinetic studies was 3.17 mgNO 2–N/L, and hence, the observed decline in SDNR at higher 
COD/N is ass ociated with the lower bioreactor NO 2–N concentration relative to K NO2. 
Furthermore, Table 5 -7 shows that the nitrite and COD concentrations are much lower than the 
substrate inhibition limits for nitrite (0.2 mgFNA/L)  and COD (acetate) (Badia et al., 2019)  and 
(Adav et al., 2010)  which indicate that there will be optimum COD/N at which maximum SDNR 
will occur, and this optimum COD/N ratio mainly depends on the carbon type, for example, the 
ratio was 6 for MWW  (Badia et al., 2019) . In a study by (Badia et al., 2019) , the maxi mum nitrite 
SDNR (carbon source: acetate) was lower (0.41 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d, at the optimum COD/N ratio 
of 13) which could be due to the nature of the biomass that was acclimatized to MWW as oppose 
to acetate. This implies that along with K N and K S, a low CO D/N ratio (low carbon source) is 
needed to maximize SDNR, compared to nitrate, and this ratio has to be analyzed to find the 
maximum SDNR whenever carbon source changes. Also, the analysis should be preferably 
conducted using acclimatized biomass to the ca rbon source and electron acceptors before the batch 
tests.  
Similar cyclic tests were conducted in the SBR2, and kinetic data including (i) nitrate specific 
denitrification rate (SDNR NO3), (ii) nitrite denitrification before nitrate exhaustion (SDNR1 NO2) 
and (iii) nitrite denitrification after nitrate exhaustion (SDNR2  NO2)  was generated (Section 5.3.3). 
Most of this data has been discussed in section 5.3.3 with the focus of nitrite accumulation. In this 
section, the discussion is on the SDNR. Figure 5 -7b shows the SDNR NO3, SDNR1  NO2, and SDNR2  
NO2 trends with various COD/N ratio.  At a low COD/N ratio of 1.1, very low SDNR NO3 was 
observed (0.078 mgNO 3-N/mgVSS -d), and SDNR1 NO2 (mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d) was also very low, 
which can be attributed to the low COD/N rat io as well as the competition between nitrate and 
nitrite denitrifies.  When the COD/N ratio increased to 1.8 the SDNR NO3 and SDNR NO2 -1  increased 
to 2.129 mgNO 3-N/mgVSS -d and 1.27 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d, respectively, due to more carbon 
source available for the two-electron acceptors. This also indicated that NiR reductase is not 
inhibited, but the accumulation was basically due to the difference between nitrate and nitrite 
SDNRs, which is in agreement with (Andalib et al., 2018a) . Furthermore, SDNR NO3 stabilized, 
and the curve approximately flattened with COD/N ratio increase; comparatively, the nitrite SDNR 
(SBR1) dropped by half with an increase in COD/N ratio from 10 to 25. This was not observed  
  144 
 with  SDNR NO3; however, it is essential to note that the maximum COD /N ratio was 10; hence the 
SDNR NO3 (SBR2)  could behave similarly to SDNR (SBR1). Akunna et al., 1993  observed a 
reduction in nitrate removal rate beyond  COD/N of 20, which indicates that if we carry out the 
cyclic test at higher COD/N (20), we may observe a decline in SDNR NO3.  
SDNR NO2 -1 also increased from 0.01 m gNO 2-N/mgVSS -d at COD/N of 1.1 to 1.29 mgNO 2-
N/mgVSS -d at COD/N of 1.8, and then decreased with the increase of COD/N to 1.8 to 0.465 
mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d. Any further increase in the COD/N did not impact the SDNR NO2-1 of 
approximately 0.5 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -d (Figu re 5-7b), which proves the direct relation between 
SDNR NO2-1 and COD/N ratio and agrees with (Badia et al., 2019, 2020) .  The second specific 
denitrif ication rate ( SDNR NO2-2) is directly related to the COD/N ratio and final NO 3-N 
concentration (Figure 5 -7b); there was no denitrification rate (zero) from nitrite ( SDNR NO2-2) at 
COD/N of 1.1, 1.8 and 2.7 , which can be attributed to the deficiency of carbon source. However, 
the SDNR2 NO2 increased at COD/N of 6.7 and 9.8 to 0.83 and 1.04 mgNO2 -N/mgVSS -d, 
respectively, higher than the nitrite SDNR in SBR1. This can be attributed to the higher denitrifiers 
diversity in SBR2, and since nitrite is generated in the pathway of the denitrification from nitrate, 
the SBR2 -biomass acclimatized to nitrite. The SDNR NO2-2 in SBR2 of 1.04 mgNO2 -N/mgVSS -d 
was much higher than SDNR NO2 in SBR1 of 0.69 mgNO2 -N/mgVSS -d, which c an also be 
attributed to the higher microbial diversity in SBR2.  
It can also be concluded that denitrification from nitrate is more than double of denitrification from 
nitrite, which agrees with H. Sun et al., 2009 , who found SDNR NO2_1 is always less nitrate -
SDNR NO3, and this is proved accor ding to our experiments in SBR2.  Ma et al., 2017  found during 
partial denitrification study nitrate SDNR NO3 range between 1.43 -1.98 mgN/mgVSS -d while nitrite 
SDNR NO2 -1 ranged  0.175 -0.211 mgN/mgVSS -d, and nitrite SDNR NO2 -2 ranged 0.54 -0.77 
mgN/mgVSS -d. This indicates that SDNR NO3 is much higher than SDNR NO2 , which agrees with 
our findings. These are the maximum SDNR NO2 -1 during the cyclic test was 0.69 mgNO 2-
N/mgVSS -d in SBR1 , and the maximum SDNR NO2 -2 in the SBR2  was 1.27 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS -
d. High SDNR NO2 -1 compared with the maximum SDNR NO2 in SBR1 (0.69mgN/mgVSS -d) can 
be attributed to  (i)  the accumulated nitrite causes high stress on the NiR reductase -enzymes which 
increase the denitrification rate to reduce the nitrite toxicity effect (Andalib et al., 2018b) , (ii) the 
difference between the m icrobial structure in both SBRs  (iii) K COD (COD -half saturation  
  145 
 concentration) for acetate is as high as 34 mgCOD/L while there is no effect of K COD at the start 
of the test (unlimited carbon source) on SDNR NO2-1, the SDNR NO2 -2 is reduced according to 
switching function due to limited carbon source  (KCOD/(K COD+COD) ). Though high COD/N of 6.7 
and 9.8 (Figures 5 -4 c and d), nitrite still a ccumulates and appeared for a short period, and this was 
due to the higher SDNR NO3 than SDNR NO2 -1 which agrees with S. Ge et al., 2012 .  
To sum up, SDNR NO3 is always higher than SDNR NO2 for specific carbon source s such as acetate , 
which causes PDN. While denitrification from nitrite saves 25% of oxygen and 40% of external 
carbon source, PDN can be a much better option since higher SDNR NO3 can be obtained, 45% and 
80% of external carbon s ource can be saved.

5.3.5.3 Nitrite half-saturation concentration and biomass specific growth rate  
Half saturation concentration for nitrite and nitrate is an important parameter because a high half -
saturation concentration will have a negative impact on the SDNR (SDNR is reduced). Therefore, 
KN is a useful tool to estimate the SDNR during the design of a wastewater treatment facility. Half 
saturation concentration for nitrate with acetate was previously studied by Cao et al., 2017  and was 
found to be 6.9 mgN/L; therefore, it wasn’t studied in this work. The Monod equation (Equation 
5-6) was u sed to determine other kinetic parameters such as 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 and K NO2 (Eddy et al., 2014) . 
This analysis was conducted in 5 batches with biomass withdrawn from SBR1 using sodium 
acetate as a sole carbon source and nitrite as an electron acceptor. The analysis was b ased on the 
specific denitrification and COD specific consumption rates in each batch.

(mg/L), NO 2-N (mg/L), and DO (mg/L), respectively.  Equation 5-6 can be simplified to Equation 
5-7 because DO is close to zero in each batch, and the het erotrophic biomass (denitrifiers) is 
completely anoxic ( 𝜂=1,𝐷𝑂 ≃0.0 ). Additionally, the unlimited COD -substrate concentration 
for acetate was used (100 mgCOD/L), is significantly higher than the reported Ks of 15 -34 mg/L 
for acetate (Stensel et al., 1973; Torres Ortiz, 2013) , and was reported as  38.1 mg/L by (Cherchi 
et al., 2009) .  Therefore, equation 6 can be reduced to equation 7.

 However, 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥 can be directly related to Y N (1.12 mgVSS/mgNO 2-N), which can be calculated 
from equation 5-8  (Badia et al., 2019)  and SDNR  (maximum SDNR) of 0.69 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d, 
according to the relation of SDNR max=µmax/YN, hence, 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥  was obtained as 0.77 d-1 for acetate 
and nitrite , which is higher than the previously reported values of 0.121 d-1 for nitrite and o.434 
d-1  for nitrate with acetate (Cherchi et al., 2009) , and reported 1.26 d-1 but with MWW -biomass 
(Badia et al., 2019) . values which were estimated from denitrification with nitrate, i.e., 0.5 d-1 
(Yalda Mokhayeri et al., 2008) , it is also close to the estimated 1.3 d-1 (Dold et al., 2008) , and 1.25 
d-1 (Nichols et al., 2007) .  The obtained 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥  is in accordance with the reported values (0.5 - 4 
d-1) for different external carbon sources (deBarbadillo et al., 2008; Dold et al., 2008; Kornaros et 
al., 1996; Stensel et al., 1973; Q. Yang et al., 2007) .

Equation 5-7 is rearranged to get equation 5-9 with the replacement Y H by Y N, the Lineweaver -

Where SDNR max is substituted by 𝝁ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑥/YN, KN was determined as 3.17 mg/L. This explains why 
complete removal of NO 2-N was not possible in the SBR1 during the experimental period, and 
this was due to the switching function of NO 2-N/(K N+NO 2-N), effluent NO 2-N is 3.5 mg/L  for the 
hole period (126 days)  (Table 5 -2, shows 40 days average ).  The reported half -saturation 
coeffic ients ( KNO2 and K NO3) are 0.9 mgNO 2-N/L and 1.4 mgNO 3-N/L for acetate (Dosta et al., 
2007) , (Almeida, Júlio, et al., 1995)  found K NO2 and K NO3 less than 0.3mgN/L, and 0.28 mg NO 2-
N/L and 0.77 mgNO 3-N/L for L -glutamic acid (Kornaros et al., 1996) . Moreover, (Badia et al., 
2019)  determined the K NO2 value of 4.2 mgN/L for MWW and 9.2mgN/L for meth anol (Badi a et 
al., 2020) , (Her & Huang, 1995a)  reported K NO2 of 10.9 mg/L and K NO3 of 14.3 mg/L with 
methanol. This indicates that K NO2 and  KNO3 are mainly affected by other factors such as initial 
electron donor and electron acceptor concentrations, electron donor type, temperature, low pH,  
biomass structure, and COD/N ratio. The high half -saturation concentration implies that the SDNR  
  148 
 will be highly reduced (50%) when nitrite concentration is equal to the K N, and the final nitrite 
effluent needs a longer time to reach to zero.

5.4 Conclusion  
The p artial denitrification process is used to partially denitrify nitrate and maximize nitrite 
accumulation that will be used potentially as an electron acceptor in a downstream anammox 
process. In this process, the PDN, more specifically, the nitrite accumulation is the limiting step.  
Hence t he fundamentals behind nitrite  denitrification versus nitrite  accumulation over nitrate 
denitrification need to be well  understood. The t hird comprehensive study characterized nitrite 
versus nitrate denitrification under lower COD/N ratios  using acetate as a carbon source . The study 
identified that:  
• nitrate SDNR (SDNR NO3, 2.67 mgN/mgVSS -d) was much higher than  nitrite SDNR 
(SDNR NO2, 0.69 mgN/mgVSS -d). Under carbon limiting condition, thermodynamically, nitrite 
denitrification is favoured over nitrate denitrification . Interestingly the current study shows this  
does not apply, which explai ned the nitrite accumula tion observed in partial denitrification 
processes.  y = 4.0888x + 1.2874

 • During nitrate denitrification, nitrite accumulation of 79% to 100% was observed at COD/N 
2.6 to 9.8,  contradictory to previous research that suggested that nitrite accumulated only at a 
lower COD/N rati o. A COD/N  of 2.7 was found to be the minimum COD/NO 3-N ratio to 
accumulate more than 79% of nitrite ; however, at higher COD/N ratios, a strategy to maintain 
the accumulated nitrite is required.  
• In the partial denitrification process, two nitrite SDNRs we re identified, one before nitrate 
exhaustion (SDNR NO2-1) and the second one after exhaustion (SDNR NO2-2). It was found that 
the SDNR NO2-2 appeared only after nitrate concentrations dipped below the nitrate half -
saturation coefficient (K NO3). Moreover, t he m aximum SDNR NO2-1 (1.27mgN/mgVSS -d) 
occurred at SDNR NO2-2 of  0 and was much higher than  all nitrite SDNRs observed in this 
study , which could be  attributed to  enhanced rate by the nitrite denitrifiers to overcome the 
nitrite accumulation str ess during PDN.  
• The taxonomic analysis clearly showed that there is no phylum and class level difference in 
denitrifiers grown in nitrate and nitrite reactors. However, genus and species level differences 
were observed with respect to composition and dive rsity. The nitrate reactor consisted of a 
more diverse community, the Zoogloea  (RA of 42%) and Thauera  genus (RA -10%), further 
causing the imbalance of NiR and NaR reductaseenzymes, hence different reaction rates. The 
microbiology data supported the observ ed difference in the SDNRs, the myth behind partial 
denitrification and potentially the lack of agreement with thermodynamics principles.

Conclusion and recommendations  
6.1 Conclusion  
Denitrification from nitrite is a new trend, with still many challenges to overcome to achieve nitrite 
shunt and partial denitrification . Firstly, a comprehensive study on denitri fication from nitrite with 
real municipal wastewater as carbon sources was conducted at varying initial COD/N ratios. The 
specific denitrification rate (SDNR) was directly related to the COD/N ratio, and a maximum 
SDNR of 0.07 (for wastewater) and 0.4 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d for acetate occurred at COD/N ratios 
of 6 and 13 , respectively.  At higher COD/N ratios, SDNR decreased. The yield coefficients were 
found to be 0.33 mgVSS/mgTCOD for municipal wastewater and 0.51 mgVSS/mgCOD for 
acetate.  Predictive models  were developed to determine SDNR as a function of initial COD/N 
ratio and F/M ratio.   
In relation to the carbon source, and due to the low carbon to nitrogen ratio in real wastewater 
(municipal wastewater -MWW), the denitrification process in full -scale wastewater treatment 
plants employ s external carbon sources to minimize total nitrogen effluent. A comprehensive study 
on denitrification from nitrite with  a mixture of  real municipal wastewater and methanol  as carbon 
sources was conducted at varying initial COD/N ratios.  The study showed kinetic  parameters  
including (i) the half -saturation nitrite denitrification coefficient (9.5 mg NO 2-N/L), (ii) denitrifier 
yield ( 0.39 mgVSS/mgTCOD ) and (iii) maximum specific growth rate ( 1.4 d-1) were higher than 
the ones obtained during the denitrification process that uses municipal wastewater as a sole carbon 
source.  The specific denitrification ra te (SDNR) was directly related to COD/N ratio , and a 
maximum SDNR of 0.5  (for MWW+methanol)  and 0.47 mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d  (MWW) was found 
at COD/N of 5.9 , much higher than the SDNR by using municipal wastewater as a sole carbon 
source .  Comparatively, upon using methanol as a sole carbon source, a lower SDNR (0.38  
mgNO 2-N/mgVSS/d ) was achieved, which implies that when methanol is supplemented with the 
MWW , a synergic effect occurs which enhances  the SDNR. The higher SDNR rates could be 
translated into 28% and 30% capital and operating cost savings, respectively; hence the addition 
of methanol as a complementary carbon source for nitrite denitrification can be considered as a 
mainstream process even for conditions carbon is not limiting i n the MWW.    
  161 
 The p artial denitrification process is used to partially denitrify nitrate and maximize nitrite 
accumulation that will be used potentially as an electron acceptor in a downstream anammox 
process. In this process, the PDN, more specifically, th e nitrite accumulation is the limiting step.  
Hence t he fundamentals behind nitrite  denitrification versus nitrite  accumulation over nitrate 
denitrification need to be well  understood. The t hird comprehensive study characterized nitrite 
versus nitrate denit rification under lower COD/N ratios  using acetate as a carbon source . The study 
identified that : 
• nitrate SDNR ( SDNR NO3, 2.67 mgN/mgVSS -d) was much higher than nitrite SDNR 
(SDNR NO2, 0.69 mgN/mgVSS -d). Under carbon limiting condition, thermodynamically, nitrite 
denitrification is favoured over nitrate denitrification . Interestingly the current study show ed 
that this does not apply, which explai ned the nitrite accumulation observed in partial 
denitrification processes.  
• During nitrate denitrification, nitrite accumulation of 79% to 100% was observed at COD/N 
2.6 to 9.8,  contradictory to previous research that suggested that nitrite accumulated only at a 
lower COD/N ratio.  A COD/N  of 2.7 was found to be the mi nimum COD/NO 3-N ratio to 
accumulate more than 79% of nitrite ; however, at higher COD/N ratios, a strategy to maintain 
the accumulated nitrite is required.  
• In the partial denitrification process, two nitrite SDNRs were identified, one before nitrate 
exhaustion (SDNR NO2-1) and the second one after nitrate exhaustion (SDNR NO2-2). It was 
found that t he SDNR NO2-2 appeared only  after nitrate concentrations dipped below the nitrate 
half-saturation coefficient ( KNO3). Moreover, t he m aximum SDNR NO2-1 (1.27mgN /mgVSS -d) 
occurred at SDNR NO2-2 of  0 and was much higher than  all nitrite SDNRs observed in this 
study , which could be  attributed to  enhanced rate by the nitrite denitrifiers to overcome the 
nitrite accumulation stress during PDN.  
• The taxonomic analysis  clearly showed that there is no phylum and class level difference in 
denitrifiers grown in nitrate and nitrite reactors. However, genus and species level differences 
were observed with respect to composition and diversity. The nitrate reactor cons isted of a 
more diverse community, the zoogloea  (RA of 42%) and thauera  genus (RA -10%), further 
causing the imbalance of NiR and NaR reductaseenzymes, hence different reaction rates . The 
microbiology data supported the observed difference in the SDNRs, the  myth behind partial 
denitrification and potentially the lack of agreement with thermodynamics principles.

 6.2 Recommendations  
According to the above research conclusions, the following are recommended future work in the 
research area:  
1- Study the effect o f various carbon source on the biomass acclimatized to nitrite and MWW, 
and model the DO effect on denitrification from nitrite ( DO inhibition concentration)  
2- Study the effect of various supplementary carbon source other than methanol in 
denitrification fro m nitrite , and the effect of this carbon source in denitrification from 
nitrite  
3- PDN study to control accumulated nitrite at high COD/N  
4- Study PDN with various MWW and various carbon sources  
5- Study the microbial shift in the acclimatized biomass (i) during long term study for the 
nitrite and nitrate  bioreactors with various carbon sources, (ii) when nitrite is replaced by 
nitrate, and nitrate is replaced by nitrite (in reverse) . 
6- Study PDN -anammox in two bio reactors
