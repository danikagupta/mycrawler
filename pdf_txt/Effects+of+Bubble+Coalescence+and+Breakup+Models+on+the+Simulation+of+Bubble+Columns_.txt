Abstract 10 
 11 
In bubbly flows, the bubble size dist ribution dictates the in terfacial area availabl e for the interphase 12 
transfer processes and, therefor e, understanding the behaviour a nd the average features of the 13 
bubble population is crucial for the pred iction of these kinds of flows. In this work, by means of the 14 
STAR-CCM+ code, the SȖ population balance model is coupled w ith an Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid 15 
approach and tested against data on upward bubbly pipe flows. The SȖ model, based on the moments 16 
of the bubble size distribution, tracks the evolut ion of the bubble sizes due to bubble break-up and 17 
bubble coalescence. Good accuracy for the averag e bubble diameter, the velocity and the void 18 
fraction radial profiles is achieved with a modified  coalescence source. Numerical results show that 19 
better predictions are obtained when these flows are considered to be coalescence dominated, but, 20 
nevertheless, additional knowledge is required to progress in the development of coalescence and 21 
break-up models that include all the possible res ponsible mechanisms. In th is regard, there is a 22 
requirement for experimental data  that will allow validation of both the predicted bubble diameter 23 
distribution and the intensity of  the turbulence in the continuous phase which has a significant 24 
impact on coalescence and break-up models. An a dvanced version of the model described, that 25 2 
 includes a Reynolds stress turbulence formulation and two groups of bubbles to account for the 26 
opposite behaviour of spherical bubbles, which accumu late close to the pipe wall, and cap bubbles, 27 
that migrate towards the pipe centre, is propose d. The Reynolds stress model is found to better 28 
handle the interactions between the turbulence and the interphase forces, and the use of only two 29 
bubble groups seems sufficient to describe the whole bubble spectrum and the bubbly flow regime 30 
up to the transition to slug flow. 31

 1. Introduction 37 
 38 
Gas-liquid bubbly flows are common to a variety of processes encountered in numerous industrial 39 
sectors, including the nuclear sect or as well as chemical and petr o-chemical, oil and gas, mining, 40 
pharmaceutical and refrigeration industries, amongs t others. In the nuclear industry, knowledge of 41 
the hydrodynamics of the two-phase flow is esse ntial for the design and operation of boiling water 42 
reactors and natural circulation systems, and in the prediction of accident scenarios for pressurized 43 
water reactors as well as for other types of reac tor. In chemical reactors,  such as bubble columns 44 
and stirred tanks, gas bubbles ar e dispersed in the liquid phase to increase phase mixing and 45 
enhance heat and mass transfer processes. 46 
 47 
In these flows, the exchange of mass, moment um and energy between the phases depends on the 48 
flow conditions, and on the interfac ial area concentration in partic ular. This, in bubbly flows, is 49 
determined by the number and the size of the bubbles  that are dispersed in the continuous liquid. 50 
Often, bubbles are not monodispersed and their di stribution is far from steady, and evolves 51 
continuously in space and time, following intera ctions between the bubbles and the continuous 52 
phase and collisions between neighbouring bubbles (Lucas et al., 2005; 2010). These interactions 53 
induce bubble shrinkage and growth due to the pre ssure field and bubble break-up and coalescence, 54 
and, in boiling or reacting flows, also wall bo iling, evaporation and mass transfer. The bubble 55 
distribution is therefore governed  by these phenomena that, with  bubble behaviour strongly related 56 
to bubble size and shape (Tomiyama et al., 1998), dete rmine the local flow field, which, at the same 57 
time, affect the ratios of mass tran sfer, break-up and coalescence. In  view of this strong coupling, 58 
understanding the evolution of th e local bubble size distribution in  these kinds of flows still 59 
represents a rather complex task which, nevertheless, is necessary if we are to be able to predict 60 
them with any degree of accuracy. 61 4 
  62 
The use of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) techni ques, applied today in design and as well as a 63 
development tool in most of the engineering disc iplines, has the potential to significantly improve 64 
our ability to predict the mentioned processes. At  the present time, application of multiphase CFD 65 
to industrial and system-scale calculations has been  mainly limited to two-fluid Eulerian-Eulerian, 66 
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) base d models (Prosperetti and Tryggvason, 2009; 67 
Tryggvason and Buongiorno, 2010). The use of more adva nced techniques, such as direct numerical 68 
simulation and large eddy simulation with interf ace tracking methods (Toutan t et al., 2008; Dabiri 69 
and Tryggvason, 2015), or Lagrangian  tracking techniques (Molin et  al., 2012), recently coupled 70 
with immersed boundary methods (San tarelli et al., 2015), is mostly c onstrained to very simple flow 71 
conditions in view of the required computa tional resources (Tryggva son and Buongiorno, 2010).  72 
 73 
In two-fluid Eulerian-Eulerian RANS models, the conservation equations for each phase are derived 74 
from averaging procedures. Therefore, the details of the interphase struct ure are not resolved and 75 
interface exchange terms requi re explicit modelling (Fox, 2012; Prosperetti and Tryggvason, 2009). 76 
In these models, the bubble diameter is often needed  as an input parameter that, therefore, becomes 77 
vital to properly predict the fl uid dynamic behaviour of the syst em. Here, possible limitations can 78 
be avoided by coupling the CFD model with the population balance equation (PBE) approach which 79 
tracks the behaviour of the bubbl e size distribution in both phys ical and internal (e.g. bubble 80 
diameter or bubble volume) coordi nate spaces (Buffo et al., 2013; Marchisio and Fox, 2005). The 81 
use of a PBE combined with CF D has been identified as a cruc ial development for the accurate 82 
prediction of bubbly flows, and significant advances have been achieved in recent years using this 83 
approach (Buffo et al., 2013; Ch eung et al., 2009, 2013; Lehr et al., 2002; Liao et al., 2015; Lo and 84 
Zhang, 2009; Marchisio and Fox, 2005, 2007; Nguyen et al., 2013; Yao and Morel, 2004). 85 
 86 5 
 Many approaches have been considered for the solu tion of the PBE within a CFD code (Buffo et al., 87 
2013). In class methods, the internal  coordinate space, which is us ually the bubble size spectrum, is 88 
discretized into numerous size classes and the PBE is  integrated over each class to give a finite set 89 
of discrete PBEs (Kumar and Ramkrishna, 19 96; Liao et al., 2015; Lo, 1996; Nandanwar and 90 
Kumar, 2008; Wang et al., 2005). In each class, bubbles may be considered as all having the same 91 
size (zero-order methods) or a specified distribution (higher-ord er methods), often a low-order 92 
polynomial (Vanni, 2000). In Monte Carlo methods, st ochastic differential e quations are solved for 93 
a finite number of artificial r ealizations of the dispersed pha se population (Lee and Matsoukas, 94 
2000; Lin et al., 2002; Zhao et  al., 2007). For both the class and Monte Carlo methods, the 95 
drawback is the high computational cost involv ed. Respectively, the solution of at least one 96 
conservation equation for each class, with all the relevant source and sink terms, is requi red, or a 97 
very high number of realizations is necessary. In the last two decades, many authors have focused 98 
their efforts on the development of the interfacial area transport equation, in  the context of both 99 
two-fluid CFD models and one-dimensional, advan ced thermal hydraulic syst em codes (Hibiki and 100 
Ishii, 2000; Nguyen et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2004; Wu et al., 1998; Yao and 101 
Morel, 2004). Being derived from averaging ov er the whole bubble diamet er spectrum, no bubble 102 
size distribution is retained and si mplifying assumptions are often made, such as the use of constant 103 
or simple linear distributions (Ishii and Hibi ki, 2006; Smith et al., 2012). Recently, promising 104 
results were achieved with progr essively more advanced appr oaches based on the method of 105 
moments, originally introduced by Hulburt and Ka tz (1964). This method is based on the solution 106 
of a set of transport equations for the lower-order moments of the dispersed phase distribution 107 
(Marchisio and Fox, 2005). Progressively, more advanced methods have been developed, in 108 
particular in the categor y of quadrature-based methods of moment s, such as the di rect quadrature 109 
method (Marchisio and Fox, 2005) and the cond itional quadrature method (Yuan and Fox, 2011). 110 
Overall, these methods are reported to provid e good predictive accuracy without excessive 111 
computational cost (Buffo et al ., 2013; Marchisio and Fox, 2005). The SȖ model, proposed by Lo 112 6 
 and Rao (2007) for droplet two-pha se flows, involves a limited number of moments of the bubble 113 
size probability distribution, which is assumed to follow a log-normal shape. The model was later 114 
extended to bubbly flows by Lo and Zhang (2009) an d its ability to predic t with a reasonable 115 
accuracy a number of differen t flows was demonstrated.  116 
 117 
Alongside the method of solution, the other key aspect in regards to population balance based 118 
approaches is the availability of reliable closure models for the coalescence and break-up 119 
mechanisms. This issue has recently been the subj ect of numerous researches (Liao et al., 2015; Luo 120 
and Svendsen, 1996; Mukin, 2014; Prince and Blanch, 1990; Wang et al., 2005; Yao and Morel, 121 
2004), and thorough reviews have been provided by Liao and Lucas (2009) for the break-up 122 
mechanism and by Liao and Lucas (2010) for the coalescence mechanism. Despite this, however, 123 
commonly accepted and reliable models have not yet emerged in view of the intrinsic c omplexity 124 
encountered when modelling coalescence and break -up in turbulent bubbly flows. Amongst others, 125 
the strong mutual interactions wi th the two-phase turbul ence, for which a general and mature model 126 
is not yet available, and the coupling and rela tive importance of the different competitive 127 
mechanisms (e.g. turbulent collisi on, wake entrainment, shearing-off)  prevent substan tial progresses 128 
on the subject being achieved and, therefore, further understanding is required. The ongoing 129 
modelling effort is supported by the experimental  data available from a number of studies 130 
(Grossetete, 1995; Hibiki and Ishii, 1999; Hibiki  et al., 2001; Liu, 1993; Lucas et al., 2005, 2010; 131 
Prasser et al., 2007; Sanyal et al., 1999). In particular, detailed m easurements of the average bubble 132 
size and the bubble size distribution have been obtained using the wire-mesh sensor technique 133 
(Lucas et al., 2005, 2010; Prasser et al., 2007).  134 
 135 
In this paper, the SȖ model, implemented in the STAR-CCM+ code (CD-adapco, 2014), is combined 136 
with an Eulerian-Eulerian two fluid model and te sted against data on ai r-water bubbly flows in 137 
pipes. With the aim to improve our ability to predict these flows and th e evolution of the bubble 138 7 
 diameter distribution, a differe nt coalescence model is introdu ced and optimized. By means of 139 
sensitivity studies, the relative impact of bubble break-up and coales cence, and the influence of the 140 
continuous phase turbulence and th e bubble-induced turbulence, are in vestigated. In terms of the 141 
turbulent flow field, and in view of the infl uence it has on the accuracy of the predictions, a 142 
Reynolds stress turbulence model is also incl uded with the aim of extending the models 143 
applicability to more complex fl ows, affected by known shortcomi ngs of two-equation turbulence 144 
models. In bubbly flows, which are polydisperse by nature, the size determines the behaviour of the 145 
bubble, with small spherical bubbles flowing near the pipe wall and larger, deformed cap bubbles, 146 
migrating towards the pipe centre (Tomiyama et al., 2002b). Clearly, predicting this behaviour is 147 
mandatory if a general model capable of ha ndling the entire bubble size spectrum is to be 148 
developed. In this regard, two bubble classes, each one with its own behaviour , are introduced in the 149 
final section of the paper. The ability of such a model, limited to only two bubble classes, to predi ct 150 
the whole bubble spectrum and the transition between  wall-peaked and core-p eaked void profiles, is 151 
then tested.  152 
 153 
2. Experimental data 154 
 155 
For any CFD technique to be applied with confid ence, it is mandatory that the model has been 156 
previously validated against releva nt experimental data. In this work, seven experiments from Liu 157 
(1993), Hibiki and Ishii (1999), Hibi ki et al. (2001) and Lucas et al. (2005) were considered. The 158 
experimental conditions consider ed are summarized in Table 1. 159

 Liu (1993) conducted experiments in a vertical pipe of 0.0572 m i.d. to study the bubble diameter 163 
and entrance length effects on the void fraction distribution in upward air-water bubbly flows. 164 
Bubble velocity, void fraction and average bubble diameter radial profiles were obtained from 165 
measurements at different axial locations. Hibi ki and Ishii (1999), and Hibiki et al. (2001), 166 
measured water and air velocity, turbulence intensity, void fraction, bubble diameter and interfacial 167 
area concentration radial profiles at three consecutive axial locations and for an  air-water bubbly 168 
flows in vertical pipes of diameter 0.0254 m an d 0.0508 m. Lucas et al. (2005) used a wire-mesh 169 
sensor to study air-water upw ard flows inside a 0.0512 m di ameter pipe. High-resolution 170 
measurements of the void fraction and the b ubble diameter distribu tion were obtained. The 171 
experiments extended over a wide range of the bubble diameter spectrum, including some mixed 172 
radial void profiles where both spherical and cap bubbles were present, one of which was 173 
specifically included in the database to validate the model with two bubble classes. Over the whole 174 
database, the water superficial velocity  considered is in the range 0.262 m s-1 < jw < 3.0 m s-1 and 175 
the air superficial velocity  is in the range 0.0368 m s-1 < ja < 0.471 m s-1. Average void fraction Įavg 176 
and average bubble diameters dB,avg reported in Table 1 were calcula ted by means of integration of 177 
the experimental profiles at the last measurem ent station. Table 1 also includes values of the 178 
Reynolds number of the flows, based on the characteristic dimension along the pipe.   179

3. Mathematical model 181 
 182 
In a two-fluid Eulerian-Eulerian mo del, each phase is described by a set of averaged conservation 183 
equations. As the cases considered in this paper are limited to adiabatic ai r-water flows, only the 184 
continuity and momentum equatio ns are solved, with the phases treated as incompressible with 185 
constant properties: 186

A lift force, perpendicular to th e direction of motion, is experien ced by bubbles moving in a shear 214

 217 
In a pipe, the lift force has a strong influence on the radial movement of the bubbles and therefore 218 
on the void fraction radial dist ribution. Generally, a positive va lue of the lift coefficient CL 219 
characterizes spherical bubbles, which are pushed towards the pi pe wall by the lift force. In 220 
contrast, larger bubbles, deformed by the inertia of the surrounding liq uid, experience a negative lift 221 
force and move towards the centre of the pipe (Tomiyama et al., 2002b). In air-water flows, a 222 
critical bubble diameter range for the change of sign in the lift coefficient between 5. 0 mm and 6.0 223 
mm was given by Tomiyama et al. (2002b). These aut hors also expressed the lift coefficient as a 224 
function of the Eötvös number, an approach adopted  in other investigations  (e.g. Krepper et al., 225 
2008; Rzehak and Krepper, 2013). In this work, however, and in view of previously observed 226 
discrepancies between calculations and experimental  data when using such an approach, constant 227 
values were chosen. More specifically, CL = 0.1 was used for wall-peak ed (Lahey and Drew, 2001; 228 
Lopez de Bertodano et al., 1994), and CL = -0.05 for core-peaked, void profiles.  229 
 230 11 
 The presence of a solid wall modifies the flow field around the bubbles and the asymmetry in the 231 
flow distribution generates a hydrodynamic pressu re difference on the bubble surface that keeps 232 
bubbles away from the wall (Antal et al., 1991): 233

In this equation, nw is the normal to the wall and Cw1 and Cw2 are constants that modulate the 236

used (Colombo et al., 2015). Finally, the turbulent di spersion force was modelled as (Burns et al., 238

Turbulence was not resolved in the dispersed phas e, but was obtained from the continuous phase. 259 
More specifically, it was directly related to the turbulence of th e continuous phase by means of a 260 
response coefficient Ct, assumed equal to unity (Gosman et al., 1992; Troshko and Hassan, 2001). 261 
Experimental measurements do in fact suggest that a value of unity is approached starting from void 262 
fractions as small as 6 % (Behzadi et al., 2004).  263 
 264 
In bubby flows, the generation of turbulence by the bubbles often modifies significantly the 265 
turbulence in the continuous phase, with respect to the single-phase flow (Lance and Bataille, 1991; 266 
Shawkat et al., 2007; Wang et al., 1987). The bubbl e contribution to turbulence was accounted for 267 
with bubble-induced source terms in  Eq. (12) and Eq. (13). In pa rticular, the drag force was 268 
considered as the only source of turbulence generation due to the bubbles and all the energy lost by 269 
the bubbles to drag was assumed to be converted  into turbulence kinetic energy inside the bubble 270 
wakes (Kataoka and Serizawa, 1989; Rzehak and Krepper, 2013; Troshko and Hassan, 2001): 271

 273 
The corresponding turbulence dissipa tion rate source is equal to the turbulence kinetic energy 274 
source divided by the timescale of  the bubble-induced turbulence ĲBI. In this work, the mixed 275 
timescale introduced by Rzehak and Krepper (2013) wa s chosen, derived from the velocity scale of 276 
the turbulence and the lengt h scale of the bubbles:  277

The mixed timescale is expected to mimic the split of eddies which move past the bubbles (Rzehak 280 
and Krepper, 2013) and the shift of  the energy of turbulence to sm aller length scales observed in 281 
experiments (Lance and Bataille, 1991; Shawkat et al., 2007). The mixed timescale, used in 282 
combination with the coefficient KBI = 0.25 in Eq. (14), has been found to provide accurate 283 
predictions over a wide range of bubbly pipe flows (Colombo et al., 2015). 284

A multiphase Reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM ) was also included in the overall model and, 286 
based on the single-phase formula tion, the Reynolds stresses ( Rij = Ĳi,jRe/ȡc) are given by (CD- 287

3.2. The SȖ model 309 
 310 
The SȖ model (Lo and Rao, 2007; Lo and Zhang, 2009) was used to model the evolution of the 311 
bubble population following break-up and coalescen ce events. In the SȖ model, the bubble size 312 
distribution is assumed to obey to a pre- defined log-normal probability distribution P(d B). 313 
Therefore, it is not necessary to divide the bubble size spectrum into a la rge number of bubble 314 15 
 classes, but the bubble population can be charac terized from a limited number of parameters, SȖ, 315 
related to  the moments of the bubble size distribution MȖ: 316

The two average diameters, d32 and d30, are equal only in presence of  a homogeneous distribution. 331 
Once the model is combined with a two-fluid Eu lerianEulerian model that solves for the void 332 
fraction, S3 is known, and only two additional moments, namely S0 and S2, are sufficient to 333 16 
 characterize the bubble size distribution. For each moment, a transport equation of the following 334 
type needs to be solved: 335

In this equation, the velocity of the air Ua is given by the two-fluid model and SȖbr and SȖcl are 338 
source terms that account for bubble break-up and coalescence in the Ȗth moment equation. Amongst 339 
the different mechanisms, interact ions induced by turbulence were a ssumed to be dominant (Lo and 340 
Zhang, 2009; Yao and Morel, 2004) and the only sour ces of break-up and coalescence in Eq. (23). 341

Following Chester (1991), Lo and Zhang (2009) cons idered two different coalescence mechanisms 379 
resulting from viscous and inertial collisions. For viscous coalescence, the film  drainage model was 380 
applied for the coalescence probability (Prince and Blanch, 1990). When two bubbles collide, they 381 
trap a thin liquid film between them that preven ts coalescence. If the interaction time in the 382 
turbulent flow is sufficient for the film to drain out until rupture of the film  occurs, then the bubbles 383 
coalesce, otherwise the bubbles ar e separated and coalescence does not occur. The drainage time 384 
was calculated from a model for a partially mobile interface and a quasi-stea dy flow in the film (Lo 385 
and Zhang, 2009): 386

Finally, in Eq. (31), kcl = (8ʌ/3)0.5 and the relative velo city between the bubbles ur = ߛሶ݀௘௤. 397 
Alternatively, for inertial collision, kcl = (2ʌ/15)0.5 and ur = ( İdeq)1/3. With regard to the probability 398 
of coalescence, the major role is  played by bubble shape oscillations and, therefore, the coalescence 399 
probability was expressed following Chester (1988): 400

h0 = 8.3 hcr.  404 
 405 
A different coalescence model, proposed by Yao a nd Morel (2004), was also considered in this 406 
work. When using the Yao and Morel (2004) approach, the break -up model described above was 407 
retained, except for the value of We crit which was modified to 1.24, fo llowing the authors proposal.  408 
In Yao and Morel (2004), the number of coalescen ce events per unit volume and unit time, which is 409 
assumed to be mainly due to the collisio ns induced by turbulence, is expressed as: 410

The first part of this equation represents the collision rate between the bubbles, whilst the 413 
exponential function describes the probability of coalescence fo llowing a collision event. The 414 
function g(Į) accounts for the effect of th e packing of the bubbles when  the void fraction is higher 415 
than a certain value. From Yao and Morel (2004), C1 = 2.86, C2 = 1.922, C3 = 1.017 and We crit = 416 
1.24. 417 
 418 
When two groups of bubbles were included, add itional source terms were added to the mass and 419 
momentum conservation equations to account for the exchanges between the groups. In a similar 420 
manner as above, the conservation equation for the moment of the bubble size distribution becomes: 421

In this equation, the subscript n identifies the bubble group a nd assumes the values s for spherical 424 
bubbles and c for cap bubbles. DȖbr and DȖcl are source terms for the d eath of bubbles by break-up to 425 
the previous group and by coalescence to the following group. Conversely, BȖbr and BȖcl are due to 426 
the birth of bubbles by coalescence from the prev ious group and by break-up from the following 427 
group. Obviously, when only two groups are consider ed, Eq. (37) simplifies and the only source 428 
terms to be considered are the death of cap bubbles which gives rise to the birth of spherical bubbles 429 
by break-up, and the death of spherical bubbles with the birth of cap bubbles by coalescence. 430 
 431 
In this work, break-up of cap bubbles into spherical bubbles has been neglec ted, with this 432 
assumption explained and justified in detail in the results section. To calculate the additional 433 
sources accounting for exchanges between groups, using Eq. (29), Eq. (30) and the hypothesis of a 434 21 
 uniform bubble distribution for the coalescence sour ce, the source terms for the death of spherical 435 
bubbles by coalescence are obtained as: 436

f(dB) is a function that expresses the probability that a coalesce nce event between two spherical 440 
bubbles leads to the birth of a cap bubble. Therefore,  it is the ratio of th e number of coalescence 441 
events that generate a cap bubble to the total number of coalescence events amongst the spherical 442 
bubble population. The coefficients -2 and -2 d2eq are calculated from the second contribution to Eq. 443 
(30) and reflect the fact that, in these events, the results is not a net change in the value of SȖ for the 444 
spherical bubbles, but a loss of two bubbles a nd their interfacial ar ea to the cap bubbles. 445 
Accordingly, from the first contribution to Eq. (30), the gain in SȖ in the cap bubble group due to 446 
coalescence events in the spheri cal bubble group is obtained as: 447

a two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry. At the inlet, fully-developed pha se velocities and void 463 
fraction boundary conditions were im posed, together with an imposed pressure at the outlet and the 464 
no-slip condition at the wall. Expe rimental measurements of averag e bubble diameter at the first 465 
measurement station were used for the bubble diameter inlet boundary condition. Therefore, 466 
experimental measurements at the last station were  compared against predictions at a distance from 467 
the inlet equal to that between the first and the last measurem ent stations. Strict convergence of 468 
residuals was ensured, together with a mass ba lance error lower than 0.01 % for both phases. 469 
Experiment HI2 was selected for a mesh sensitiv ity study, the results of which are presented in 470

equal to 0 at the pipe centre and to 1 at the pipe wall. Four grids were tested with a progressively 473 
increasing number of equidistant grid nodes (10  100, 15  150, 20  200, and 25  250). The 474

4. Results and discussion 486 
 487 
This section describes and discus ses the simulation results and co mparisons against experimental 488 
data. First, the experiments of Liu (1993), Hibiki  and Ishii (1999) and Hibi ki et al. (2001) were 489 
simulated with the YM model (Yao and Morel, 2004)  and the results are presented in Figure 2 and 490 
Figure 3. As can be seen, the YM model generally  overestimates the average bubble diameter. In 491 
particular, marked overestimations were obtained at  the lowest liquid veloci ties (Hi1, HI1 and L1), 492 
whereas, at higher velocities (Hi2, HI2 and L2), the overestimation is reduced and, for experiment 493 
24 
 HI2 (Figure 3a) only, good agreement with data is found. The tendency of the YM model to over- 494 
predict the bubble diameter has already been noted by Cheung et  al. (2007) and Nguyen et al. 495 
(2013). To serve as a benchmark, predictions from the LZ model (Lo and Zhang, 2009) are also 496 
included in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Overall, the LZ model provides be tter accuracy when predicting 497 
the average bubble diameter. Neve rtheless, and similar to YM, a strong dependency on the liquid 498 
velocity is apparent. At low velocity, good agr eement, or limited overestimation of the bubble 499 
diameter, was obtained (with resp ect to YM) but, at higher velo cities, LZ under predicts the 500 
experiments. In addition, as already reported in Lo and Zhang (2009), the bubble diameter is 501 
generally under predicted in the near wall region, probably as  a consequence of the excessively 502 
strong bubble break-up rate there.  503 
 504 
The availability of experimental data allowed a further optimization of the YM  model to be made. 505 
As the over prediction of the bubble diameter is possibly due to an excessive amount of bubble 506 
coalescence in the flow, this was limited by modifying the value of We crit in Eq. (36), where it 507 
mainly impacts the coalescence probability. Therefore, a lower We crit reduces the coalescence 508 
probability or, from a different perspective, it re duces the interaction time available to the liquid 509 
film trapped between the two colliding bubbles to drain out. Calibration of the model was limited to 510 
the coalescence model (the model for break-up was not changed from that of Lo and Zhang (2009), 511 
except for the value of We crit, equal to 1.24 for YM). Even if th e average bubble diameter is still 512 
overestimated at low liquid velo city and underestimated at hi gh liquid veloc ity, acceptable 513 
agreement was achieved in all the tested conditions with We crit = 0.10 (YM opt. lines in Figure 2 514 
and Figure 3). Overall, the improvement in the accu racy with respect to the original YM and LZ 515 
models is significant. In th e near wall region, where LZ si gnificantly under predicts the 516 
experimental data, the value of  the bubble diameter is well pred icted, with the exception of 517 
experiment HI1 (Figure 2g) in which the flow rate is particularly low. In addition, for the LZ model, 518 
optimization on a case-by-case basis has been found necessary to reach a comparable accuracy (Lo 519 25 
 and Zhang, 2009), whereas, in this work, the same value of We crit was maintained for all flow 520 
conditions considered. In view of this finding,  additional research work is required to develop more 521 
general and accurate models of bubble break-up and coalescence. 522 
 523 
Figure 2 and Figure 3 also show radi al profiles of the mean water ve locity and void fraction (for L1 524 
and L2, Figure 3e and Figure 3h, the air velocity is also provided). Overall, simulation results are in 525 
good agreement with the experiments. The mean velo city is under predicted for L2 and, but only in 526 
the pipe core region, for Hi1. With regards to the void fraction, the best agreement is found for the 527 
wall-peaked void profiles (Figure 2c, Figure 3f a nd Figure 3i). In contrast , the core-peaked void 528 
profiles were more difficult to predict. As it is po ssible to see from Figure 2 and Figure 3, a larger 529 
bubble size spectrum characterizes th e core-peaked void profiles (Hi2, HI1 and HI2) with respect to 530 
the wall-peaked profiles, where the average bubble diameter radial di stribution is generally flatter. 531 
This complicates the simulation of the momentum tran sfer at the interphase, even with the use of a 532 
population balance model. As shown in Figure 2f, Figure 2i and Figure 3c, a sharp increase in the 533 
near wall region, followed by an almost flat profile, is usually predicted. The experiments, however, 534 
show a more gentle but continuous increase of the void fraction towards the pi pe centre. Predictions 535 
are similar amongst the three different models consid ered. This suggests that it is the interphase 536 
momentum forces (lift and wall forces in particul ar) that mostly determine the radial void fraction 537 
and mean velocity profiles. In this regard, the use of constant lift force co efficients, not dependent 538 
on the bubble diameter, may significan tly inhibit changes in the lift force induced by changes in the 539 
latter diameter.  540 
 541 
The role of the critical Weber number in the YM model is the focus of the results given in Fi gure 4, 542 
where the average bubble diameter profile is shown for three different values of We crit. It has 543 
already been mentioned how  We crit mainly affects the coalescence pr obability. Specifically, a lower 544 
We crit reduces the coalescence pr obability and, therefore,  the average bubble diam eter. This effect is 545 26 
 equivalent to reducing the inte raction time available for the liquid film trapped between two 546 
colliding bubbles to drain out, or, equivalently, to increasing the tim e required by this liquid film to 547 
drain out. Figure 4 includes two diffe rent experimental datasets. It is  observed that th e reduction in 548 
coalescence with We crit is higher at the low flow rate (Fig ure 4a), while the effect of a lower We crit is 549 
reduced at the higher flow rate (Figure 4b). At high flow rates, therefore, the interaction time is low 550 
given the high level of turbulen ce, and hence the coalescence proba bility has a co rrespondingly low 551 
value. As a consequence, the amount of decrease achievable by tuning We crit is also low. At low 552 
flow rates, in contrast, the coalescence probability is higher due to the longe r interaction times that 553 
occur in a low level turbulence fi eld, and hence this probability can  be significantly affected by a 554 
change in the value of We crit. 555

4.1. Effect of the break-up model 574 
 575 
As mentioned, no changes were introduced in th e break-up model, except for the value of the We crit, 576 
which, for YM, was increased to 1.24 following the authors proposal (Yao and Morel, 2004). Since 577 
no clear indications of the amount of bubble break- up occurring are available for the flows studied 578 
in this work, additional simulati ons neglecting break-up were made to evaluate the impact of the 579 
break-up model on the predictions. In  Figure 5, four of the experiments were predicted with and 580 
without accounting for break-up. For the majority of  the pipe cross-section, the effect of break-up 581 
on the bubble diameter distribution is  seen to be negligible. In the near wall region, break-up is 582 
effective in reducing the average bubble diameter, but only at the highest li quid velocities (Figure 583 
5b and Figure 5d). At low velocities, break-up is ne gligible even in the region close to the wall 584 
(Figure 5a and Figure 5c). Overall, and in view of the agreement obtained with these experiments, 585 
these results suggest that coalescence is  the dominant mechanism in these flows. 586 
 587 
Since only the net result of the combined action of both break-up and coalescence is available in 588 
terms of the experimental data, this being the average bubble diameter, additional sensiti vity studies 589 
30 
 were made, increasing the impact of both. The same We crit value of 0.25 was adopted in both the 590 
break-up and the coalescence models. The increase in the rate of coalescence with a higher critical 591 
Weber number was already addressed in Figure 4. A lower We crit in the break-up model increases 592 
the break-up rate since a lower energy is re quired to break-up the bubble. The value of We crit 593 
adopted is now close to that used in the LZ mode l and, therefore, a comparable amount of break-up 594 
is to be expected. The results are presented in Fi gure 6. Even if some impr ovement is obtained for a 595 
number of flows (Figure 6a, Fi gure 6c and Figure 6e), excessi ve break-up causes an under 596 
prediction of bubble diameter at high liquid velocities (Figure 6b, Figure 6d and Figure 6f). In 597 
addition, and except for experiment HI1 (Figure 6c), the bubble diamet er is always underestimated 598 
in the near wall region, where, in vi ew of the higher levels of turbul ence, break-up is expected to be 599 
more significant. Again, these results are similar to those obtained with the LZ model (Figure 2 and 600 
Figure 3), for which an excessive amount of break -up, in particular in the near wall region, has 601 
already been reported (Lo and Zhang, 2009). This further supports the case for these flows being 602 
coalescence dominated. 603 
Overall, and despite the previous results, it rema ins difficult to precisely evaluate the accuracy of 604 
the model with regard to the competitive action of coalescence and break-up, and the mechanisms 605 
involved. As mentioned, only the net result is available through data on the average bubble 606 
diameter. Therefore, additional knowledge is re quired on the physics of these flows, and on the 607 
interaction between bubbles and with the continuous phase in particular. The lack of information on 608 
these processes is a significant constraint on the fu rther development of these models that needs to 609 
be overcome if more accurate modelling is to be achieved. As an example, the recent tendency has 610 
been to include all possible mechanisms of  bubble break-up and coalescence (e.g. turbulent 611 
collision, wake entrainment, shearing-off) (Liao et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2004). 612 
Even if this may benefit the generality of the de veloped models, the relative influence of each 613 
mechanism has been generally optimized with a dditional constants tuned against average bubble 614 
diameter measurements, which, at the present time , is the only real option available to modellers. 615 31 
 Without a clear knowledge of the effective impact  of each mechanism as a function of the flow 616 
conditions, however, accurate prediction of the average bubble diameter does not guarantee the 617 
accuracy of each individual model, and possibly incr eases the uncertainty in the results and limits 618 
the applicability of the m odel itself. In view of this, advances must rely on the availability of more 619 
detailed experimental measurements or, perhaps,  accurate direct numerical simulations of bubble 620 
behaviour. 621

 632 
4.2. Continuous phase turbulence sensitivity 633 
 634 
Turbulence parameters affect in different ways the models for co alescence and break-up, and, as the 635 
latter models are based on the collision of bubbles due  to turbulence, they ar e expected to have a 636 
significant impact on results. The sensitivity to th e turbulence model predictions has already been 637 
investigated in some literature studies (Nguye n et al., 2013; Yao and Morel, 2004), but, in many 638 
more, the assessment and optimization of the co alescence and break-up models was carried out 639 
without considering the accuracy of the turbulence predictions. The aim of this section, therefore, is 640 
to address the dependency of results on the continuous phase turbulence.  641 
 642 
In bubbly flows, the contribution of the bubbles to the continuous phase turbulence is accounted for, 643 
in the k-İ turbulence model, by source terms in the equations of that model (Eq. (11) and Eq. (12), 644 
Section 3.1).  645 
34 
  646 
Figure 7 shows radial profiles of the predicted SM D as a function of the amount of bubble-induced 647 
turbulence, together with the continuous phase streamwise turbulence intensities I. Turbulence 648 
measurements are available only from Hibiki a nd Ishii (1999) and Hibiki  et al. (2001), where 649 
turbulence intensity was calculated by dividing the streamwise r.m.s of  the velocity fluctuations by 650 
the maximum liquid velocity. Three different case s are considered: no bubbl e-induced turbulence, 651 
and Eq. (14) with KBI = 0.25 and KBI = 1.0.  At low flow rates (HI1, Figure 7i), or for wall-peaked 652 
void profiles (Hi1, Figure 7g, and L1, Figure 7k), where the presence of the bubbles induces a flat 653 
mean velocity profile and a strong reduction of th e shear-induced turbulence production in the pipe 654 
centre, the contribution of  the bubble-induced turbulence is signi ficant. For the high flow rate wall- 655 
peaked case (L2, Figure 7l), where the turbulence level is already high and the void fraction in the 656 
pipe centre is low, and the core-peaked void profiles (Hi2, Figure 7h, and HI2, Figure 7j), where the 657 
shear-induced production remains significant, the im pact of the bubble-induced  contribution is less. 658 
In the first case scenario, signifi cant differences in the turbulen ce level cause bubble diameter 659 
profiles to be very different from  one another (Figure 7a, Figure 7c and Figure 7e). This means that 660 
these results are depend ent on the continuous phase turbulence and, for some flows, on the bubble- 661 
induced turbulence model as well. Therefore, fo r a proper model validation, both the average 662 
bubble diameter and the continuous phase turbulen ce predictions need to be compared against 663 
experiments. Conversely, the results may be depe ndent not only on the flow s used for validation, 664 
but also on the specific bubble-indu ced turbulence model. Unfortuna tely, turbulence measurements 665 
are not available for all the experi ments considered. Moreover, for th e data of Hibiki  et al. (2001), 666 
turbulence levels were always under predicted, ev en when considering all the drag force to be 667 
converted to turbulence kinetic energy. It must be pointed out that the turbul ence intensities in these 668 
data appear significantly higher than for other experiments in the literature having comparable 669 
geometry and flow conditions (L iu, 1998; Serizawa et  al., 1975; Wang et al., 1987). For HI1 and 670 
HI2, instead, satisfactory predictions were obtaine d. In view of the limited number of simultaneous 671 35 
 measurements of both the bubble diameter distribut ion and the flow turbulence, some additional 672 
comparisons are shown in Figure 8, taking advantage of a previous validation of the bubble-induced 673 
turbulence model (Eq. (14) and Eq. (15)), which s howed satisfactory accuracy over a wide range of 674 
conditions (Colombo and Fairweather, 2015). In Figure 8, radial profiles of the r.m.s. of streamwise 675 
velocity fluctuations are compared against differ ent bubbly flow data in ve rtical pipes. For these 676 
validations, the bubble diameter wa s fixed and assumed equal to expe rimental observations, even if 677 
only rough averaged values were available for the majority of the experiments. Even if some 678 
discrepancies are still apparent , the overall agreement can be considered satisfactory. This 679 
additional validation, although useful, did not allow a comparison of bubble diameter and 680 
turbulence for the same experiment and, therefore, c oncerns related to data av ailability still remain. 681 
Recently, the development of advanced experimental techniques has allowed detailed 682 
measurements of the average bubble diameter and the bubble diameter distribution (Lucas et al., 683 
2005, 2010; Prasser et al., 2007). However,  in view of the previous re sults and to better support the 684 
modelling effort, experimental measurements need  to allow not only the validation of the bubble 685 
diameter distribution, but also of th e continuous phase turbulence level. 686 
 687 
In Figure 7, YM predicts a higher SMD, therefore a higher coalescence ratio, with a decrease in the 688 
continuous phase turbulence. Collisi on rate increases with turbulen ce, while coalescence probability 689 
reduces, with the latter being th e dominant effect. This qualit atively behaviour needs further 690 
examination. In Figure 9, the same sensitivity study is made for the LZ model, for experiments Hi1, 691 
Hi2 and L1. The turbulence intensity behaviour  remains the same, but the bubble diameter 692 
predictions are changed. At low liquid veloc ity (Hi1 and L1) and without the bubble-induced 693 
turbulence model, bubble diameter is high at the wall, where the turbulence remains high, whereas 694 
it is low in the centre of the pipe due to the reduc ed turbulence in this region. When the turbulence 695 
level is increased, the coalescence is also incr eased, and, consequently, the SMD. With a further 696 
increase of the turbulence, the bubble diameter is  reduced by a decrease of  the coalescence or, more 697 36 
 likely, by an increase of bubble break-up, which is  higher for this model (Section 4.2). At high 698 
velocity (Hi2), the break-up is already high ev en without including b ubble-induced turbulence. 699 
Therefore, with an increase of th e turbulence level, the break-up is  further increased and a decrease 700 
of the SMD is observed. For YM, even if a reduction in the coalescence following an increase of the 701 
turbulence, at already high turbulen ce levels, cannot be excluded, in the limit of zero turbulence, an 702 
increase of the coalescence is expected following an increase in the turbulence. Therefore, despite 703 
the good accuracy shown, the qualitative behaviour of  YM with the turbulence level, which is 704 
different from that of LZ, suggests the need fo r additional future verification of these models. 705 37

 4.3. Reynolds stress turbulence model 723 
 724 
Using the YM model, the same tests were repeated  with a Reynolds stress turbulence model and the 725 
results are presented in Figure 10 and Figure 11. A comparable leve l of agreement with data is 726 
found using both turbulence models for the SMD profiles (Figure 10 a-c and Figure 11 a-c), and 727 
similar velocity profiles were  obtained (Figure 10 d-f and Figure 11 d-f). Similar void fraction 728 
profiles were also obtained for the wall-peaked  cases (Figure 10g, Figure 11h and Figure 11i), 729 
although for the core-peaked profiles, the behaviour of  the void fraction is reproduced better by the 730 
RSM (Figure 10h, Figure 10i and Figure 11g). More sp ecifically, in such cas es the void fraction 731 
gently increases from the wall towards the pipe centre. However, for the k-İ model, the increase is 732 
sharper near the wall, and the profile is then fl atter towards the pipe centre. In a turbulent bubbly 733 
flow, the turbulence may interact w ith the interphase forces, inducing a radial pressure gradient in 734 
the flow that impacts upon the distribution of the di spersed phase (Ullrich et al., 2014). Generally, 735 
since the turbulence is higher near the wall, the pressure accordingly increases towards the pipe 736 
centre. It is this pressure gradie nt that is likely responsible for the over predicted void fraction peak 737 
for experiment L2 (Figure 11i). 738 
 739 
In bubbly pipe flows, the turbulen ce is anisotropic, and this anis otropy can be reproduced using a 740 
Reynolds stress model (Colombo et al., 2015). Therefor e, different results should be expected when 741 
using a k-İ model, because of the different turbulent stre sses, or if the turbulence kinetic energy is 742 
added to the pressure. It must be noted, howev er, that differences between the two turbulence 743 
modelling approaches might be obscured by the in fluence of the interfacial momentum forces, 744 
which have been the object  of a significant amount of optimizatio n and refinement in  the past. It is 745 
the opinion of the authors, however, that even wh en a similar accuracy is obtained (wall-peaked 746 
profiles), the use of a Reynolds stress formulation pr ovides more insight into the distinctive features 747 
of the flow and should assist th e development of models of more  general applicability. In this 748 40 
 regard, Ullrich et al. (2014) pred icted some wall-peaked void fraction profiles with an RSM, whilst 749 
neglecting lift and wall reflection forces.  750 
 751 
Differences between the turbulence model predictions are also apparent in the turbulence intensity 752 
profiles (Figure 10 j-l and Figure 11 j-l). These, ev en if small for the majority of cases, induce 753 
differences in the coalescence rates which, as di scussed in the previous section, are strongly 754 
dependent on the turbulence in the continuous phase . The different coalescence rates, together with 755 
differences in the void frac tion profiles, can be cons idered the reason for the slight disparity in the 756 
bubble diameter and the mean ve locity profiles between the k-İ model and the RSM. 757

 4.4. Two-group model 769 
 770 
It was mentioned in the introduction how bubbly flow s are generally characte rized by polidispersity 771 
and by an extended range of bubble sizes. The compar isons in the previous sections demonstrated 772 
the different behaviour of sphe rical and larger cap bubbles, show ing wall-peaked or core-peaked 773 
void fraction profiles induced by the value of the average bubble diameter. When both types of 774 
bubble are present in a comparable amount, the voi d fraction profile may exhibit both wall- and 775 
core-peaked features, as is the case for the expe riment L1, depicted in Figure 12 (Lucas et al., 776 
2005). These experiments are particul arly difficult to predict because the distinctive features of both 777 
bubble types must be reproduced. Therefore, an a dvanced model with two different bubble classes 778 
was specifically implemented to predict these kinds  of flows. In view of the results from the 779 
previous sections, and the in ge neral negligible impact of break- up, only the additional sources due 780 
to the coalescence of two spherica l bubbles into a cap bubble were considered. For this case, the 781 
value of the critical diameter dc was assumed equal to 5 mm. Comp arison against experimental data 782 
is provided in Figure 12, based on the RSM predic tions. As shown in the figure, the void fraction 783 
radial profile and the behaviour of both the spherical and the cap bubbles are well predicted. Near 784 
the wall, the void fraction profile increases rapidly b ecause of the presence there of the majority of 785 
the spherical bubbles. After a region where it remain s almost flat, the void fraction increases again 786 
towards the pipe centre where the cap bubbles accu mulate, pushed there by the negative lift force. 787 
In a similar manner, close to the wall, the averag e bubble diameter is close to the average diameter 788 
of the spherical bubbles, whereas it tends to the average diameter  of the cap bubbles towards the 789 
pipe centre.  790 
 791 
The bubble size distribution, wh ich is tracked by the Sy model, is shown at three different axial 792 
locations in Figure 13. The plots display hdB, which is, following the work  of Lucas et al. (2005), 793 
the contribution of each bubble size to the total void fraction: 794 
 795 44 
 ݄ௗಳൌ݀ሺߙሻ
݀ሺ݀஻ሻ (44)
 796 
In this way, the contribution of larger bubbles, which are few in number but carry a significant 797 
amount of the total air volume, is properly account ed for (Lucas et al., 2005). Experimental data 798 
were obtained by averaging over the whole pipe cross-section. For the predictions, the bubble 799 
distribution was extracted from th e simulation at each node and is s hown in Figure 13 for the near- 800 
wall region (Figure 13a) and fo r the pipe centre (Figure 13b). At the first ax ial location ( L/D = 8.4), 801 
two distinct peaks are shown in both the experiment al and the numerical results. Starting from the 802 
inlet, the predominance of coales cence events leads to the form ation of larger bubbles, as is 803 
demonstrated by the second peak in the profile at around 6 mm. Obviously, being still close to the 804 
inlet, large bubbles repres ent only a small fraction of the tota l void fraction. At this location, the 805 
total void fraction is overestimated, as can be seen from the higher peak values predicted. This is 806 
due to the fact that it was not possible to match th e inlet conditions of the e xperiment exactly due to 807 
lack of data, in particular for the velocity of the phases. Therefore, some distance from the inlet is 808 
required for the flow to establish. Predicted values of the void fraction at the two other locations are 809 
indeed significantly closer to the experime ntal values. At the second axial location ( L/D = 29.9), the 810 
bubble population evolves and, since coalescence re mains predominant, the number of larger 811 
bubbles increases. Two distin ctive peaks are still pres ent, but the larger diam eter peak is now the 812 
greatest. This shift of the bubble diameter spectr um to larger values is well reproduced by the 813 
simulation, with the main differen ce with experiment bei ng a larger number of bubbles in the region 814 
between the two peaks. At the final location ( L/D = 59.2), the larger bubbles  are in the majority, 815 
with the first peak at around 4 mm now being very  small. The same evolution is found in the 816 
simulation, with a more diffuse distribution and an  extended spectrum of diam eters. It should be 817 
noted that the variance of the dist ribution is lower and the first peak still present near the wall where 818 
the majority of the spherical bubbles are present.  In contrast, near the pipe centre, where the 819 45 
 majority of the larger bubbles accumulate, the aver aged experimental spectr um is overestimated and 820 
the bubble population extends to even higher valu es of the bubble diameter. The experimental 821 
profile, therefore, can be qualitativ ely considered an average of th ese two behaviours. In view of 822 
these results, the evolution of the bubble diameter  distribution is predicted with a satisfactory 823 
accuracy, even with the rather simple model adopt ed which could be subject to numerous further 824 
improvements. Therefore, the ch allenge of predicting the whole bubble size spectrum from small 825 
spherical to large cap bubbles seems to be ma nageable with the use of only two bubble groups. 826

5. Conclusions 839 
 840 
In this work, the SȖ model (Lo and Zhang, 2009), based on the moments of the bubble size 841 
distribution, was coupled with an Eulerian-Eul erian two-fluid model with the STAR-CCM+ code, 842 
and tested against the data fr om seven upward bubbly flow expe riments in pipes. Through the SȖ 843 
model, the evolution of the bubble size distributi on was followed through the flows, so that the 844 
average SMD and the interfacial area concentration, which are cruc ial for the prediction of the 845 
phase interactions, could be  tracked. Being based on th e method of moments, the SȖ model also has 846 
the advantage that the required computational resources are limited. The addition of a diff erent 847 
coalescence model (Yao and Morel, 2004), based on the collision of bubbles in turbulence and on 848 
the film drainage model, and further optimized ag ainst the experiments, allowed reproduction of the 849 
experimental radial profiles of the average bubble diameter. More specifically, a constant crit ical 850 
Weber number value of 0.10 in th e coalescence model was suffici ent to obtain a satisfactory 851 
predictive accuracy. 852 
 853 
47 
 A sensitivity study suggested a neg ligible effect of the bubble break-up model and the best results 854 
were achieved by considering these flows to be  dominated by bubble coalescence. However, the 855 
lack of availability of experime ntal data, limited to the average bubble diameter alone, constrains  856 
research work in the field. In particular, it is extremely difficult to evaluate the competitive 857 
contributions of break-up and coalescence, and to  extend the modelling to cover all possible 858 
mechanisms involved. Therefore, additional know ledge is required, by means of experiments or 859 
direct numerical simulations. Continuous phase tur bulence was noted to significantly influence the 860 
predictions of the model. In this regard, validati on of turbulence models need s to be carried out in 861 
conjunction with that for the bubble diameter evolution, and requires the availability of additional 862 
complete datasets. In addition, different coal escence models were found to display different 863 
qualitative behaviour following changes in the flow  field turbulence level, and this requires further 864 
investigation. 865 
 866 
Lastly, an advanced version of the overall mode l described was tested. This included a Reynolds 867 
stress turbulence formulation and two groups of bubbles, accounting for spherical bubbles 868 
accumulating close to the wall and cap bubbles migr ating towards the pipe centre. The RSM, in 869 
addition to performing better in flows where known shortcomings of two-equation turbulence 870 
models are present, provides be tter accuracy in predicting core -peaked void fraction profiles and 871 
properly accounts for the interaction between the turbulence and the interphase forces. Comparison 872 
with a complex void fraction profile suggested that extension of the model to only two bubble 873 
groups is sufficient to describe the whole bubble spectrum, and the bubbly flow regime up to the 874 
transition to slug flow, even though additional comparisons with  data are necessary.    875
