SUMMARY
Refractory status epilepticus (SE) has a mortality
rate of up to 35%. Current treatment protocols forthe treatment of SE begin with benzodiazepinesand then proceed to conventional anticonvulsants.
If seizures continue, SE is considered refractory
(RSE) and treatment with anesthetic agents inundertaken. Twenty-four h to 48 h after initiationof anesthesia with midazolam, pentobarbital orthiopental, or propofol, an attempt is made towean the anesthetic. If this fails and seizures recur,SE is considered highly refractory (HRSE) andrepeated attempts are undertaken. No random-
ized trial data are available to guide the choice of
anesthetic agent in either RSE or HRSE status.Medication resistance in established SE is thoughtto result, in part, from internalization of synapticc-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, making
them unavailable for modulation. Neurosteroidsact on both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA
A
receptors, which are not internalized, and are
therefore hypothesized to have a role in the treat-ment of RSE. SGE-102 is a neurosteroid metabo-
lite of progesterone with demonstrated
anticonvulsant properties in animal seizure mod-els. A randomized double-blind placebo-con-trolled adjunctive trial of SGE will include subjectsrandomized at the time that initial treatment withanesthesia is initiated. Subjects will receive mi-dazolam and either SGE-102 or placebo. Midazo-lam will be tapered and discontinued between
hours 24 and 48. SGE-102 or placebo will be con-
tinued through hour 120. The primary end pointwill be the difference in proportion of subjectsfrom each arm who remain seizure free throughhour 120. Secondary end points will include theproportion of subjects who are seizure free at hour168, 2 days after discontinuation of the experi-mental agent. The study will be powered to have a
90% chance of detecting a clinically meaningful
reduction in seizure recurrence at 120 h. Compre-hensive safety and pharmacokinetic data will alsobe obtained during the course of the trial.KEY WORDS: Clinical trial, Neurosteroid, Anti-

Status epilepticus (SE) is acknowledged as a neurologic
emergency with significant morbidity and mortality; theprognosis of the subgroup of patients who are refractory tofirst- and second-line therapies is particularly grim. Themortality rate among such patients is estimated to be about35% and, at least one third of the patients who recover, doso with significant neurologic morbidity (Claassen et al.,2002; Shorvon & Ferlisi, 2011; Hocker et al., 2013; Sutter
et al., 2013).There is, therefore, a dire need for more effective treat-
ment for patients in “refractory ”SE (RSE). There are
established therapies for “early ”status epilepticus (ben-
zodiazepines) and for “established ”SE (fos-phenytoin,
valproic acid, and so on) that have been approved for mar-keting by regulatory agencies in several countries. Thereare, however, no approved treatments for patients in RSE.The commonly used medications for patients whose sei-
zures have been refractory to first- and second-line agents
include midazolam, propofol, and pentobarbital; however,all of these medications are used “off-label ”and none of
them has proven efficacy in SE. The use of these agents totreat patients in RSE has been the subject of several retro-spective reviews (Lowenstein & Alldredge, 1993; Mayeret al., 2002; Holtkamp et al., 2005; Rossetti et al., 2005).One attempt at a prospective, randomized, double-blind

STATUS EPILEPTICUS 2013trial aimed at evaluating the comparative efficacy and side
effect profile of two of these agents failed because of inad-equate enrollment (Rossetti et al., 2011).
SGE- 102 FOR THE TREATMENT OF
REFRACTORY STATUS EPILEPTICUS
To address the need for a proven treatment for RSE, a
novel compound, SGE-102, based on allopregnanolone is
being developed. Allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid, allos-terically modulates both synaptic and extrasynapticGABA
Areceptors. As seizures become prolonged benzo-
diazepine-sensitive GABA Areceptors, which are only
present in synapses, become internalized and functionallyinactive (Naylor et al., 2005). Extrasynaptic receptors arenot internalized as seizures continue and therefore are a
target through which allopregnanolone might treat SE,
even when benzodiazepines have become ineffective(Reddy & Rogawski, 2012).
Allopregnanolone has been shown to be effective in
preclinical models of seizures and status epilepticus. Thisincludes the enhancement of GABA-evoked chloride cur-rents in cultured hippocampal neurons (Kokate et al.,1994), the protection against pilocarpine- or kainate-
induced limbic seizures and SE, with higher protective
index values than clonazepam (Kokate et al., 1996), pro-tection against bicuculline- or picrotoxin-induced seizures(Belelli et al., 1989), the lack of tolerance to pentylenetet-razol (PTZ) –induced seizures in mice (Kokate et al.,
1998), and a complete suppression of generalized amyg-dala-kindled convulsions (Lonsdale & Burnham, 2007). Arat model of SE induced by kainate has shown that allo-
pregnanolone (30 mg/kg, i.p.) eliminated SE whether
administered at 10 min or at 70 min following chemocon-vulsant administration, whereas diazepam (50 mg/kg,i.p.) was only effective at 10 min (Lossin, 2012).
Phase 2CLINICAL TRIAL
OFSGE-102 FORRSE
In that there has never been a successfully completed
clinical study to prove the efficacy of a therapy for RSE, anovel trial design is presented. The design is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on trial in adult patients inRSE for <24 h, that is, those patients who have failed to
respond to first- and second-line treatments and are beingconsidered for drug-induced suppression of seizure activ-ity/coma. In this trial, at the point when the physician deci-
des to induce suppression of seizure activity and clinical
coma in a patient who has not responded to first- andsecond-line medications, the patient will be assigned in arandomized fashion, to SGE-102 +midazolam intrave-
nous (IV) orplacebo +midazolam IV. This study will be
performed only in selected centers where continuous EEG(cEEG) can be performed and at which there is experiencein treating RSE. Except for the treatment with study drug
(placebo or SGE-102) +midazolam IV, all subjects will
receive the standard of care, as per the center ’s protocol,
for adults in RSE. All patients will be intubated.
After starting treatment with midazolam +study drug
for 24 h, the patient will be progressively weaned off mi-dazolam over hours 25 –48. The patient will remain on
study drug for 72 additional hours (through 120 h), unless
rescue medication is required. If no rescue medication is
required and the patent remains seizure free, the studydrug will be tapered and discontinued over 24 h. If whileon midazolam, hypotension (systolic blood pressure [BP]<90 mm Hg) occurs, the midazolam infusion will be sus-
pended or reduced by half and the patient will be treatedclinically as appropriate (e.g., vasopressors). If seizureactivity resumes at any time during or after the weaning of
midazolam, the patient will be treated as medically appro-
priate in view of the investigator (including possiblyrestarting the midazolam IV at the same dose as before, oradministration of another general anesthetic).
The primary end point will be the proportion of treated
patients with no clinical or electrographic seizures lasting>1 min from 60 min after loading dose of SGE-102 until
treatment cessation (days 1 –5). Secondary end points will
include the proportion of patients with no clinical or elect-
rographic seizures lasting >2 min for 2 days after cessa-
tion of SGE-102 treatment (days 6 –7), and the functional
outcome at 1 month posttreatment. Safety data will besummarized using descriptive statistics.
Safety will be addressed through an assessment of the
incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverseevents and clinically important changes in safety assess-
ments (including vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, elec-
trocardiographic monitoring, electroencephalographicmonitoring, and physical and neurologic examinations).All patients will be in neurologic intensive care unitswhere constant monitoring for adverse events will takeplace.
A preliminary power calculation to determine sample
size was derived according to data from retrospective and
observation studies on the success rate of midazolam IV in
treating RSE. The studies used to derive this efficacyassumption used efficacy end points similar to the onesthat will be used in his protocol. The sample size will bederived to have 90% power to show a difference betweenthe SGE-102 group and the placebo group with an alphalevel of 0.05.
