 Abstract  
Ammonium -N and phosphate -P-rich anaerobic digester sludge liquor recovered during sewage 
sludge dewatering contributes more than 30% of the total nitrogen loading when returned to the 
municipal wastewater plant. Hence, side stream treatment could offer an economic alternative 
given its relatively low flow and high concentration of nutrients. However, traditional biological 
nitrification/denitrification requires considerable energy for nitrification and organic carbon for 
denitrification. During the past dec ade, considerable work has described the mechanism of the 
partial nitrification (nitritation) and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). The nitritation -
anammox processes have been demonstrated  to be efficient for nitrogen reduction from high 
ammonia conte nt waste streams . However, no comprehensive study has compared different reactor 
configurations, operational conditions and their application for sludge liquor treatment.  
Hence, the objectives of this PhD dissertation were to assess different reactor desi gn and 
operational strategies, investigate microbial population diversity, density and functional stability 
to optimize ammonium reduction processes. In order to assess reactor design, one and two -stage 
nitritation -anammox reactor configurations, MBBR (mov ing bed biofilm reactor) and IFAS 
(integrated fixed film activated sludge) were compared under varying operation conditions (e.g., 
various aeration, seeding, feeding and control strategies), along with the need of pre -treatment to 
reduce P -inhibition.  
Under best operation conditions, average NH 4+-N removal efficiency was 89 -91% with an NH 4+-
N loading rate of 0.62 -0.68 kg N/(m3·d). Intermittent aeration, maintaining a low DO concentration 
(0.18 -0.28 mg/L), sludge recycling for keeping AOB active and specifi c anammox activity (SAA) 
monitoring were important strategies for successfully operation of the nitritation -anammox reactor. 
Microbial analysis showed that nitritation -anammox biomass harbored a high microbial diversity iii 
 when feed raw lagoon supernatant. Hi gh throughput sequencing indicated that the dominant 
nitrifiers in the IFAS -SBR, Nitrosomonas , facilitated nitritation; and that Candidatus Brocadia  
was the dominate bacteria responsible for the anaerobic ammonia oxidation observed.  Overall the 
present st udy showed that application for lagoon supernatant treatment is achievable by applying 
nitritation -anammox processes, either by two -stage or one -stage operation, but that the one -stage 
configuration provided considerable simplification and reduced nitrite inhibition with sequential 
aeration strategy provided.

 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES  
1.1. Background and motivations  
Discharge of insufficiently treated municipal wastewater into the natural water bodies can 
cause eutrophication in the receiving water bodies because municipa l wastewater generally 
contains excessive nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). In Canada, sludge generated from 
municipal wastewater treatment plants is often treated via anaerobic digestion to stabilized 
the sludge, reduce the sludge volume and to recover  energy. Digested sludge liquor 
separated from the solids through the dewatering processes commonly contains high 
concentrations of ammonia, and requires further treatment to reduce the ammonia content. 
As the trend towards greater energy efficiency and hi gher effluent standards increases (e.g. 
< 5 mg/L of ammonium concentration in summer; < 10 mg/L of ammonium concentration 
in winter from Alberta’s ammonia discharge limits), more careful attention of the digested 
sludge liquor treatment have become necessa ry. The conventional 
nitrification/denitrification process which requires significant aeration efforts is energy 
intensive. Newer biological processes, such as the nitritation/denitritation and 
nitritation/anammox processes require low oxygen demand are em erging, but information 
on the implementation of these processes at the full -scale is limited, especially for 
operations under cold Canadian conditions.  
1.2. Objectives  
The objectives of this study included:  
(1) To study the feasibility of applying anammox IFAS configuration for the treatment of 
digester sludge thickening lagoon supernatant.  2 
 (2) To identify key reactor operation conditions to improve the treatment efficiency of one -
stage and two -stage nitritation -anammox processes when treat ing digester sludge 
thickening lagoon supernatant.  
 (3) To compare the nitrogen reduction performance of three reactor configurations, 
including (i) two -stage nitritation -anammox sequencing batch reactor (SBR), (ii) one -stage 
nitritation -anammox sequencing  batch reactor (SBR), and (iii) continuous operating one -
stage nitritation -anammox.

 CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW  
2.1. Research needs on nitrogen reduction  
Efficient removal of nutrients, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, from municipal 
wastewater has become an important concern because their accumulation in receiving 
waters can cause eutrophication. Algal and cyanobacterial growth in eutrophied rivers and 
lakes eventually leads to anoxic conditions that kill oxygen respiring fish and other animals, 
and release of cyanotoxins that impact on human and animal health. Untreated ammonium 
is also a major toxin of aquatic biota. Canadian municipal wastewater treatment  plant 
sludge (generated from primary and secondary treatment processes), is typically treated by 
anaerobic digesters to reduce the sludge volume and to recover bioenergy. Digested sludge 
liquor can then be separated from solids by dewatering processes. Re sidual sludge liquor, 
which contains high ammonia concentrations (often > 1000 mg/L), needs to be managed 
before disposal.  
Figure 2.1. A schematic of wastewater treatment processes  
 
Lagoon supernatant is often pumped back to the main wastewater treatment plant for 
treatment where it contributes about 30% of the plant’s incoming nitrogen load but only 1% 
5 
 to the total wastewater flow, or even lower during high flow conditions (Shao et al., 2018 ).  
A schematic of wastewater treatment processes can be found in Figure 2.1.   Processes for 
the treatment of high ammonia lagoon supernatant is known as side -stream treatment.   
2.2 Biological nitritation treatment te chnologies  
Compared to chemical nitrogen removal, e.g., struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) 
precipitation, coagulant -aided precipitation, ammonia stripping, ion exchange in selective 
resins, and breakpoint chlorination, biological treatment is much mor e economical, energy 
efficient, and environmentally sound (Gavrilescu and Chisti, 2005 ). Biological treatment 
of ammonia -rich wastewater utilizes  slow -growing lithoautotrophic bacteria such as 
aerobic ammonia -oxidising bacteria (AOB ), nitrite -oxidising bacteria (NOB ), anaerobic 
anammox bacteria (Anammox) , and fast -growing heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria .  
2.2.1 Conventional nitrification/denitrification processes  
Nitrification/denitrification processes  utilize AOB (which convert ammonia to nitrite), 
NOB (which convert nitrite to nitrate), and denitrifiers (which convert nitrate to nitrite, 
nitrite to nitrous oxide, nitrous oxide to nitric oxide, and nitric oxide to nitrogen gas) as 
shown in Figure 2.2. Nitrification occurs as two -step process. The complete reactions for 
nitrification, which included biomass production, are as follows (equation 2.1, equation 2.2 
and equation 2.3) (Focht and Chang, 1975 ; Hauck, 1984 ):

Five genera of AOB have been reported: Nitrosococcus , Nitrososmonas , Nitrosospira , 
Nitrosovibrio  and Nitrosolobu s (Jiang and Bakken, 1999 ). Seven genera of NOB have been 
reported: Nitro bacter , Nitrospina , Nitrospira , Nitrotoga , Nitrolancea , Nitrococcus , and 
Candidatus Nitromaritima  (De Boer and Kowalchuk, 2001 ). Achromobacter, Thiobacillus , 
Micrococcus  and some species of Pseudomonas  are identified as denitrifiers (Coyne et al., 
1989 ).  
Oxygen and carbon requirements for nitrification/denitrification process are illustrated in 
Figure 2.2. Based on the above reaction, 4.57 g O 2 is needed per g of NH 4+-N oxidized and 
4.8-6.0 g COD is needed per g of NO 3--N denitrified (Dalentoft and Jenson, 1994 ). Usually, 
nitrite oxidation  by nitrite oxidation proceeds more rapidly than ammonia oxidation, and 
nitrite rarely builds up in the reactors. This process can be effectively utilized for municipal 
wastewater treatment. However, the treatment of ammonia -rich sludge liquor using this 
process can be costly due to a high oxygen demand for nitrification and a high carbon 
source demand for denitrification. It is noted that sludge liquor often contains low COD/N 
ratios (COD/N < 0.5) due to the extended COD degradation and ammonia dissolution  in 
the digesters.  
2.2.2 Nitritation/denitritation processes  
Nitritation/denitritation processes utilize AOB which convert ammonia to nitrite 
(nitritation) and denitrifiers which convert nitrite to nitrous oxide, nitrous oxide to nitric 
oxide, and nitric o xide to nitrogen gas (denitritation), and eliminate the growth of NOB in 
the bioreactors (Hellinga et al., 1998 ). Nitritation step is divided into two steps with 8 
 hydroxylamine (NH 2OH) as the intermediate product. In the first step (equation 2.5), NH 3 
was oxidized to NH 2OH. In the second step (equation 2.6), NH 2OH was further oxidized 
to NO 2-. Equation 2.8 is overall r eaction for nitritation carrier by AOB. The autotrophic 
AOB utilizes NH 4+ for cell growth where the CO 2 is the carbon sources as shown in 
equation 2.9.  The metabolism reaction for denitritation (acetic acid as the carbon source) 
is illustrated in equation 2.10.

 Oxygen and carbon requirements for nitritatio n/denitritation process are illustrated in 
Figure 2.3. Based on the above reaction, 3.42 g O 2 is needed per g of NH 4+-N oxidized and 
2.9-3.7 g COD is needed per g of NO 2--N denitrified (Balmelle et al., 1992 ). This process 
can save up to 20% of the oxygen demand and up to 40% of the carbon source requirements 
compared to a conventional nitrification/denitrification process.  
2.2.3 Nitritation/anammox  processes  
Further, the nitritation process may be combined with the anammox (anaerobic ammonium 
oxidation) as the nitritation/anammox  process es (Figure 2.4). This process has been 
implemented in full -scale treatment plants over the past 15 years. Anammox bacteria 
anaerobically oxidize ammonia using nitrite as an electron acceptor, a process that 
produces nitrogen gas (Strous, 1997 ). The anammox  bacteria is  autotrophic bacteria. The 
anammox bacteria utilizes CO 2 as the carbon source and the energy is obtained via 
oxidizing NO 2- to NO 3-. Anammox bacteria are classified as Planctomycetes phylum  
(Jetten et al., 1998 ; Schmid et al., 2000 ).  
The nitritation/anammo x process can be either two -stage system or one -stage system (Van 
der Star et al., 2007 ; Van Hulle et al., 2010 ). In two -stage system, nitritation and anammox 
process  are separated into two reactors. The reactions for the 1st stage of nitritation reaction 
is shown in the equation 2.1.  
The overall stoichiometry for the 2nd stage of anammox reaction is shown in equation 2.11. 
In one -stage system, AOB and anammox bacteria are co -existed. Equation 2.12 shows the 
combined reactions for one -stage nitritation -anammox process.

Oxygen and carbon requirements for nitritation/anammox process are illustrated in Figure

Except that the amount of NO 3--N produced accounts for  11% of the NH 4+-N and NO 2--N 
metabolized during nitritation/anammox process and it requires addition 4.8 -6.0 g COD 
11 
 per g of NO 3--N denitrified in the final effluent if needed. Overall, oxygen requirements 
for nitritation/anammox is 57% less than those for  conventional nitrification/denitrification 
because only half of the ammonia is converted to nitrite ion aerobically, while the rest is 
converted to N 2 anaerobically via anammox.  
2.3 Strategies for achieving and maintaining nitritation process  
2.3.1 Free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA)  
Both of free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA) can impact nitrification reactions. 
High levels of FA is considered as an inhibitor that can inhibit the activity of nitrite 
oxidoreductase of NOB (Yang and Alleman, 1992 ). The FNA inhibition mechanism is that 
HNO 2 is the toxicity form that inhibits nitrification/denitrification process. In other words, 
HNO 2 acts as an uncoupler by donating a proton which further interferes with the 
transmembrane pH gradient (Glass et al., 1997 ). Free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid 
(FNA) are determined by pH, temperature, NH 4+ or NO 2- (equation 2.13 and 2.14) 
(Anthonisen et al., 1976 ).

Where 𝐾𝑏𝐾𝑤=𝑒(6344 273 +℃) ⁄⁄  and 𝐾𝑎=𝑒(−2300 273 +℃) ⁄ 
The reported FA threshold con centrations for inhibiting NOB varies. Rongsayamanont et 
al. (2010 ) found that NOB activity was affected when FA reached 5 mg L-1. In the study 
of Kim et al. (2003 ), the activity of NOB in a membrane bioreactor was completely 12 
 inhibited at FA of 0.2 mg L-1 and NOB activity recovered when FA was l ower than 0.2 mg 
L-1. FNA is also considered as an important parameter for inhibiting the activity of NOB 
especially at low pH (<7.5) (Zhou et al., 2011 ). The inhibition of FNA on AOB and NOB 
was reported at 2.8 and 0.06 mg L-1, respectively (Sudarno et al., 2011 ). In the study of 
Wang et al. (2017a ), it was found that 1.9 mg N L-1 of FNA caused over 60% of NO 2- 
accumulation in the nitritation bioreactor suggesting successf ul repression of NOB activity.   
2.3.2 Dissolved oxygen (DO)  
The DO half saturation coefficient of AOB (0.2 -0.4 mg O 2 L-1) is much lower than that of 
NOB (1.2 -1.5 mg O 2 L-1) (Wilczak et al., 1996 ). The difference allows AOB to outcompete 
NOB when dissolved oxygen concentration  in bioreactor keeps low because of a higher 
affinity for AOB. Hanaki et al. (1990 ) found that nitrite oxidation rate carrier out by NOB 
was significantly affected at 0.5 mg L-1 of DO condition in flocs system. In the membrane 
bioreactor, NO 3- concentration in the effluent increased at DO of 5.0 mg L-1 suggesting that 
complete nitrification occurred. Furthermore, NO 2- began to accumulate when DO was 
decreased from 5 mg L-1 to 0.5 mg L-1 suggesting that NOB activity was inhibited after 
condition s change (Bernet et al., 2001 ). In the study of Ruiz et al. (2003 ), the optimal DO 
concentration for achieving stable nitritation process was 0.7 - 1.5 mg L-1. Chuang et al. 
(2007 ) concluded that the optima l DO was 0.2 mg L-1 where the maximum ammonia 
oxidation rate achieved 1.46 kg N m-3 d-1.   
2.3.3 pH  
The optimal pH range for AOB growth is 7.0 - 8.5 and for NOB is 6.0 - 7.5 (Anthonisen et 
al., 1976 ). Kumar and Nicholas (1983 ) found that the activity of AOB was adversely 13 
 affected when pH is under 6.5 - 7.0. It is suggested that pH should keep at 7.5 - 8.5. In the 
study of Peng and Zhu (2006 ), the changes of pH affected the concentration of FA and 
FNA which will further influence the ac tivities of AOB and NOB.  
2.3.4 Temperature  
At temperatures between 10 and 20 oC, the specific growth rate of NOB is significantly 
higher than that of AOB in the bioreactor (Hynes and Knowles, 1983 ). Previous  study 
found that the growth rate of NOB -Nitrobacter  was higher than AOB -Nitrosomonas  when 
the temperature was lower than 12 oC (Helder and  De Vries, 1983 ). Increasing temperature 
ensures successful enrichment of AOB population while repressing the activity of NOB in 
the bioreactor. When temperature was higher than 25 oC, results showed a higher ammonia 
oxidation rate than nitrite oxidatio n rate in flocs system (Hellinga et al., 1998 ). The optimal 
temperature for maintaining high activity of AOB is 25 - 35 oC. Moreover, it should be 
noted that the temperature also affects the chemical equilibr iums of FA and FNA (Gabarró 
et al., 2012 ).  
2.3.5 Sludge retention time (SRT)  
The minimum doubling time for AOB and NOB are 7 h and 13 h (Pérez et al., 2014 ), 
indicating t hat AOB can outcompete NOB by adjusting sludge retention time (SRT) in the 
bioreactor.  In the study of Pollice et al. (2002 ), the effects of SRT on the nitritation 
performance was investigated. Results showed that the maximum nitrite accumulation was 
increased from 0 to 500 mg L-1 when SRT was reduced from 40 day to 10 day suggesting 
that by reducing SRT, the AOB activity became dominate.  
2.4. Strategies for achieving and maintaining anammox process  14 
 2.4.1 Substrates  
NH 4+ and NO 2- are essential substrates for the growth of anammox bacteria. However, high 
levels of substrates are toxic to anammox bact eria. Previous study found that at the 600 mg 
N L-1 of NH 4+ concentration in the batch study, the inhibition on anammox bacteria was 
obviously observed (Carvajal -Arroyo et al., 2013 ). The mechanisms of the FA impact on 
anammox bacteria are discussed in the following part 2.3. Similarly like the FA inhibition 
mechanism on anammox bacteria activity, FNA (free nitrous acid) has been reported in 
various studies to be the cause of inhibiti on (Zhou et al., 2011 ). In the study of Carvajal -
Arroyo et al. (2014 ), the activity of anammox bacteria was completely inhibited when the 
feed NO 2- concentration was higher than 100 mg L-1. Similar levels of NO 2- inhibition 
impacts on the anammox reactions were also reported, and the nitrite inhibition on the 
anammox reactions was believed to be reversible (Fux et al., 2004 ; López et al., 2008 ).  
2.4.2 Temperature  
Based on previous research study, the optimum temperature range for anammox reaction 
is 30 –40 oC (Strous et al., 1999 ). At high temperature condition, the membrane proteins 
are denaturized which causes of release of intracellular organelles and further cell lysis for 
the anammox reaction (Boleij et al., 2019 ). Low temperature condition decreases the 
bacteria growth rate, enzyme activities, and therefore affecting the activity of anammox 
bacteria  (Van Loosdrecht and Jetten, 1998 ). In the study of Strous et al. (1997 ), the optimal 
temperature range for the anammox bacteria growth was between 30 oC and 37 oC. Isaka 
et al. (2008 ) evaluated the impact of temperature on NH 4+ removal efficiency. Results 
showed that NH 4+ removal efficien cy reached 11.5 kg N m-3 d-1 when the temperature was 
kept at 37 oC while the NH 4+ removal efficiency decreased to 8.1 kg N m-3 d-1and 0.36 kg 15 
 N m-3 d-1, respectively when the temperature dropped to 20 -22 oC and 6 oC.  The tolerance 
ability for anammox bac teria to varied temperatures were reported to be dependent on the 
different species of the anammox bacteria (Park et al., 2017 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). Previous 
studies reported that the activity of the anammox genus Candidatus Scalindua  was 
observed at 20 and 30 °C, but not at 10 °C in a up -flow fixed -bed column reactor (Awata 
et al., 2012 ). In the study of Narita et al. (2017 ), the maximum nitrogen removal rates were 
6.7 and 1.1 g N L−1 d−1 at 35 °C and 15 °C, respectively where Candidatus Brocadia sinica  
was enriched in membrane bioreactor.  
2.4.3 Free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA)  
The FA and FNA inside the cell change the pH and neutralizes the transmembrane potential 
which wi ll cause cell death during anammox reactions (Zhang et al., 2016 ). It was reported 
that activity of anammox bacteria was significantly affected when FA was higher than 14 
mg L-1 (Waki et al., 2007 ). The lowest of FA inhibition threshold on anammox bacteria 
was reported  at concentration of 2.0 mg L-1 (Jung et al., 2007 ). In the study of Strous et al. 
(1999 ), FNA at level of 6.0 μg HNO 2-N L-1 caused complete inhibition on the activity of 
anammo x bacteria. Anammox bacteria was inhibited when the concentration of FNA was 
increased to 0.04 mg HNO 2-N L-1 (Egli et al., 2001 ). Therefore, the control of FA and FNA 
is important for maintaining a stabilized operation system.  
2.4.4 Organic carbon sources  
Organic carbon source can adversely impact anammox reactions through the following two 
different proposed mechanisms among different studies: in the first reported mechanism, 
inhibition on anammox bacteria occurs due to the competition between the anammox 16 
 bacteria and the heterotrophs especially under high concentrations of organic matters since 
the growth rate of heterotrophs is much higher than anammox bacteria (Lawson et a l., 
2017 ). In the study Güven et al. (2005 ), the growth rate of anammox bacteria was affected 
because of the competition with heterotrophs in one reactor system when influent ratio of 
C/N was high than 1. In t he study of Chamchoi et al. (2008 ), the activity of anammox 
bacteria was completely inhibited when COD concentration exceeded 200 mg L-1. The 
activity of anammox bacteria was reduced to 30% when ethanol concentration in the 
influent was higher than 50 mM. The application of anammox bacteria is suitable for the 
treatment of wastewater with low C/N ratio (Gao et al., 2012 ). In the second reported 
mechanism, the anammox bacteria utilizes organic  matter instead of using NH 4+ and NO 2-
as substrates (Giustinianovich et al., 2016 ). As a result, the nitrogen removal efficiency 
performed by anammox bacteria is adversely affected.  
2.4.5 Other reported influencing factors  
High salinity results in high osmotic pressure, and the anammox bacteria in high salt 
concentrations will die or become dormant (Kartal et al., 2006 ). In the study of Liu et al. 
(2009 ), the nitrogen removal efficiency carried out by anammox bacteria under anoxic 
condition was sharply reduced when  salt concentration was increased to 30 g L-1. Phosphate 
is also reported as inhibitor on the anammox reactions. The enzyme activity of anammox 
bacteria was affected under high PO 43- feed condition, through forming complex structures 
which causes a lower e nzyme activity (Zhang et al., 2017 ). Previous  study reported that 
150 mg P L-1 of PO 43- caused a loss of the anammox activity (Van de Graaf et al., 1996 ). 
The activity of anammox bacteria was found 1.6 -times lower at 60 mg P L-1 of PO 43- and 
5-times lower at 120 mg P L-1 of PO 43- feed conditions (Pynaert et al., 2003 ). Since 17 
 anammox bacteria are light -sensitive microorganisms, the activity of a nammox bacteria 
can be inhibited with light. Previous study reported that long term exposure of light had 
adversely impact on the growth of anammox bacteria (Jin et al., 2012 ).  
2.5 Nitritation -anammox process applications  
2.5.1 One -stage nitritation -anammox  
Depending on the aeration strategies, dominant microbial community, suspended or 
biofilm growth and reactor control strategies, one stage nitritation -anammox process 
include: DEMON (Deammonification) (Wett et al., 2015 ), OLAND (oxygen limited 
autotr ophic nitrification denitrification) (Schaubroeck et al., 2012 ), CANON (completely 
autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite) (Vázquez -Padín et al., 2009 ), SNAP (single -
stage nitrogen removal using anammox and nitritation) (Zhang et al., 2014 ). 
In this process, NH 4+ is partially oxidized to NO 2- carried out by AOB. Under oxygen 
limited conditions, the activity of NOB is successfully repressed due to a lower affinity of 
NOB to oxygen compared to AOB.  In the meantime, the oxidized NO 2- and the remaining 
NH 4+ in the bioreactor is further converted to N 2 carried out by anammox bacteria either 
simultaneously (Corbalá -Robles et al., 2016 ) or intermittently (Yang et al., 2015 ) 
depending on the operation strategy and its activity performance. Equation 2.12 shows the 
overall reaction for one stage nitritation -anammox process. As discussed in part 2.3 and 
2.4, useful strategies can be applied for maintain a stabilized operation of nitritation and 
anammox process. Those control parameters include substrates loading, temperature, 
dissolved oxygen conce ntration, SRT, FA and FNA. Yang et al. (2016 ) investigated the 
different process control strategies for one sta ge nitritation -anammox operation. Results 18 
 showed that the optimal DO concentration was 0.70 - 0.80 mg L-1. The activity of anammox 
bacteria began to decrease at a higher DO (1.0 - 1.2 mg L-1) condition. In the study of 
Lackner and Horn (2013 ), movin g-bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) operation and SBR 
operation for one stage nitritation -anammox were compared. Results showed that MBBR 
system achieved higher nitrogen removal rates than SBR operation because of a higher 
biomass and less aeration limitation. Va rious configurations of one stage nitritation -
anammox process have been established for the pilot -scale and full -scale operation. The 
configurations include the moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR), integrated fixed -film 
activated sludge (IFAS), granular slud ge and SBR (Castro -Barros et al., 2015 ; Malovanyy 
et al., 2015a ; Malovanyy et al., 2015b ). Among those configurations, SBR is the most 
commonly applied reactor type for nitritation -anammox process and over 80% of 
configurations are operated as one stage nitritati on-anammox process (Lackner et al., 2014 ).  
2.5.2 Two -stage nitritation -anammox  
This two stage nitritation -anammox is also called Sharon®-Anammox® (single reactor high 
activity ammonia removal over nitrite -anaerobic ammonium oxidation) processes (Hwang 
et al., 2005 ). Equation 2.1 and 2.11 show the separated reactions in two reactors for the two 
stage nitritation -anammox. In the first aerobic reactor, NH 4+ is partially oxidized to NO 2- 
by AOB. Ideally, almost no NO 3- is produced in this reactor under specific operation 
conditions (i.e. higher temperature, high levels of FA and low dissolved oxygen 
concentration) where the activity of NOB is inhibited. In the second anaerobic reactor, the 
nitritation effluent containin g the remaining NH 4+ and produced NO 2- is further treated 
carried out by anammox bacteria (Gut et al., 2006 ). Unlike one stage nitritation -anammox 
process, high levels of NO 2- concentration in the bioreactor should be prevented in case the 19 
 activity o f anammox bacteria is inhibited due to the accumulation of NO 2- (Kimura et al., 
2010 ). In two -stage nitritation -anammox process, two reactors are separated where the 
effluent from nitrita tion process is used as the influent for the 2nd stage of anammox process. 
For nitritation process (1st stage), SHARON is most intensively applied technologies for 
the treatment of high ammonia rich wastewater. The operation temperature was 30 - 40 oC 
whic h enabled successful repression of NOB activity. For anammox process (2nd stage), 
SBR operation has been reported as most reliable reactor for the anammox enrichment. In 
the study of Fux et al. (2002 ), a pilot scale SBR reactor for two -stage system was 
investigated. Over 90% of the total influent nitrogen was removed. A continuously stirred 
tank reactor (CSTR) was successfully applied for anammox process (Wang et al., 2017b ). 
The results suggested that the addition of hydroxylam ine could be applied for fast 
reactivation of anammox bacteria. Two-stage process has no risks for oxygen inhibition on 
the anammox bacteria. Also, two -stage has lower risks for anammox to be out competed 
by heterotrophs since most of carbon sources were u tilized in the 1st stage of nitritation 
reactor. One stage operation has lower risk for NO 2- inhibition. However, the interactions 
between different groups of bacteria (i.e. AOB, NOB, heterotrophic bacteria and anammox 
bacteria) are needed to be monitored and analyzed (Jaroszynski and Oleszkiewicz, 2011 ).  
2.5.3 Operational challenges for nitritation -anammox process  
The operation for nitritation -anammox process either in one stage or two stage have been 
a challenge. Control for NOB growth, adjustments for dissolved oxygen concentrations, 
NO 3- build up, interferences with heterotrophs and anammox seed sludge souses are 
considered as operational challenges especially due to the sensitivity of anammox bacteria 
during the start -up and optimization of this proce ss. Since the final product of nitritation 20 
 process is NO 2-, the NO 2- from the effluent in nitritation process are needed to be treated 
(Ge et al., 2015 ). Either anammox process or denitrification process can be the secondary 
treatment options. Moreover, for the side stream treatment, biggest of concern by applying 
nitritation p rocess is the production of high level of N 2O (Okabe et al., 2011 ). Incomplete 
AOB denitrification is believed the main pathway and the high NO 2- accumulat ion triggers 
the N 2O emissions (Pan et al., 2016 ). While in the nitritation reactor, AOB is dominant and 
the NO 2- is the final product. Many of researchers now are focusing on how to mitigate the 
N2O emissions for the treatment of side stream wastewater.  
For the anammox bacteria enrichment, there is a shortage of the anammox seed sludge. In 
nature, no anammox bacteria activity can be detected because of its low abundance. It also 
takes a long time t o start up the reactors (Van der Star et al., 2007 ). The start -up time for 
the first full -scale anammox reactor lasted for 3.5 years in Rotterdam (Lackner et al., 2014 ). 
Studies will be needed to  investigate different strategies to speed up the start -up time. High 
levels of NH 4+ and NO 2- have toxicity to anammox bacteria (Tang et al., 2010 ). 
The inhibition  caused by  substrates r esults in instability of the anammox process, 
especially for the high influent concentrations of the NO 2- for two -stage reactor. Dissolved 
oxygen (DO) concentration control for one stage system is important since anammox 
bacteria is sensitive to oxygen. A high DO will result in complete nitrification while low 
DO will affect the NH 4+ oxidation rate which will impact the overall nitrogen removal 
efficiency.

 CHAPTER 3 THE VALUE OF FLOCS  AND BIOFILM BACTERIA FOR 
ANAMMOX STABILITY WHEN TREATING AMMONIA -RICH DIGESTER 
SLUDGE THICKENING LAGOON SUPERNATANT 1 
3.1. Introduction  
Biological treatment of ammonia -rich wastewater by conventional nitrification -
denitrification processes requires considerable energy (to deliver aeration) and external 
organic carbon source (for denitrification), which results in a high solids production a nd 
solids management requirement, and often faces problems of poor performance and 
instability (Khin and Annachhatre, 2004 ). An aerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) 
provides an energy/cost -effective alternative for ammonium removal with wastewaters 
high in nitrogen (Jetten et al., 2001 ). The anammox bacteria utilize ammonium and nitrite 
directly under anoxic conditions to form dinitrogen gas (Strous et al., 1998 ). Recently, the 
feasibility of the anammox in various reactor configurations and modes of operation to 
treat ammonia -rich wastewaters generated from anaerobic digestion of sludge have been 
demonstrated (Jeanningros et al., 2010 ; Gonzalez -Martinez et al., 2011 ; Schaubroeck et al., 
2012 ; Pereira et al., 2017 ). In particular , attached biomass ( i.e., biofilm) and granular 
sludge have been utilized to have a longer retention time, reducing wash out and promoting 
the growth of slow growing bacteria ( i.e., anammox bacteria) . Previous studies have also 
shown that as compared to flocs , biofilm and granular sludge biomass better tolerate stress 
conditions (Huang et al., 2015 ; Shi et al., 2015 ). However, study also showed that flocs  
 
1 A version of this chapter has been published: Yang, S., Guo, B., Shao, Y., Mohammed, 
A., Vincent, S., Ashbolt, N. J., & Liu, Y. (2019). The value of flocs and biofilm bacteria 
for anammox stability when treating ammonia -rich digester sludge thickening lagoon 
supernatant. Chemosphere, 233, 472 -481. 34 
 with a loose structure have advantages in substrates transportation and diffusion from the 
liquid phase into the flocs . And it can enhance the growth of microbes and the removal of 
contaminant  (Pérez et al., 2005 ). Hence, attached biomass and flocs  may differ in their 
physical structural properties, but it is unreported how this may impact on their functional 
microbial diversity.  
Bioreactors that operate with both biofilm (i.e. MBBR) and flocs  are called integrated 
fixed -film activated sludge (IFAS) reactors. In this IFAS configuration, biofilm could 
enrich the slow growing anammox bacteria and their detachment may lead to “seeding” of 
the mixed liquor flocs . Thus, the IFAS configuration combin es the advantages of biofilm 
on a carrier and suspended growth systems, and biomass in attached and suspended phases 
may work synergistically to enhance ammonia removal.  
Previous studies have demonstrated that hybrid IFAS systems which have segregated 
microbial communities and functions between biofilm and flocs  could improve the one 
stage partial nitrification and anammox (PN/A) process (Laureni et al., 2019 ); however, no 
studies have been reported on the impact of IFAS on the second stage ( i.e., anammox only 
stage) of a two -stage PN/A process. Our current study addresses that research gap, and was 
conducted to (1) investigate the feasibility of applying the anammox IFAS configuration 
(second stage of two stage PN/A) for the treatment of digester  sludge thickening lagoon 
supernatant, and (2) investigate the responses of biofilm and flocs  in the hybrid system 
under high organic loading conditions. Initially, a synthetic nitrite source was used, 
followed by switching the reactor feed to a nitritatio n effluent to demonstrate the second 
stage of a PN/A system. Biofilm and flocs  in the IFAS reactor were assessed, comparing 
the variations of the microbial community in the reactor.  35 
 3.2. Methods and materials  
3.2.1. Raw lagoon supernatant feeding  
Ammonia -rich supernatant was collected from a digester sludge thickening lagoon in the 
City of Edmonton once a month. The lagoon supernatant was pretreated on -site in an 
Ostara® facility for phosphorus removal. Pretreated lagoon supernatant was then 
transported t o the University of Alberta Campus and used as laboratory bioreactor feed. To 
minimize the microbial activity, the collected lagoon supernatant was stored in a 4 C cold 
room prior to use.  
3.2.2 Feed water quality  
The water chemistry of the reactor feed w ater in three different operation phases, the lagoon 
supernatant and the nitritation reactor effluent (used as part of phase III feed) is shown in 
Table 3.1. Reactor feed water in Phase I and phase II was supplemented with NaNO 2.  As 
shown in Table 3.1, NH 4+-N in the feed was 250 ± 20 in phase I and increased to 420 ± 35 
mg-N/L in phase II. NO 2--N was supplemented to maintain a molar ratio of NH 4+-N to 
NO 2--N at 1:1.32 required for anammox reaction; measured concentrations were 325 ± 35 
and 525 ± 45 mg -N/L in phase I and phase II, respectively. The COD concentration 
increased from 145 ± 25 mg/L in phase I to 305 ± 55 mg/L in phase II.  
In phase III, the effluent from a laboratory nitritation reactor treating lagoon supernatant 
was used to provide NO 2--N and mimic the complexity of real wastewater. Design, 
operation conditions, and reactor performance of the nitritation reactor are available i n our 
previously published literature (Shao et al., 2019 ). The nitritation reactor converted over 
95% of NH 4+-N to NO 2--N, and the average  effluent NH 4+-N, NO 2--N and NO 3--N 
concentrations were 10 ± 5 mg -N/L, 965 ± 55 mg -N/L, and 22 ± 3.5 mg -N/L, respectively. 36 
 After mixing, phase III feed water NH 4+-N and NO 2--N concentrations were 435 ± 45 mg -
N/L and 535 ± 65 mg -N/L, respectively, comparabl e to the Phase II feed water condition 
(P > 0.05). The COD concentration in phase III increased significantly to 583 ± 75 mg/L, 
as compared to phase II (P < 0.05).  
3.2.3. Anammox reactor operation  
A 6 L working volume of bench scale integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) reactor 
was operated in a sequencing batch mode for 259 days. The reactor was initially seeded 
with AnoxK™5 biofilm carriers, kindly provided by Veolia (Montreal, Canada), with a 38% 
volume fill rat io (i.e., volume ratio of biocarriers and total reactor volume).   
Reactor operation can be divided into three phases. In phases I and II, 25% and 50% lagoon 
supernatant feed water was prepared by diluting raw lagoon supernatant with deionized 
(DI) water in 1:3 and 1:1 volume ratio, respectively. Sodium nitrite was supplemented as 
the NO 2--N source to bioreactor at a molar ratio of 1.32:1 of NO 2--N (from NaNO 2) to 
NH 4+-N (from diluted lagoon supernatant). In phase III, raw lagoon supernatant was used 
as reactor feed water. The effluent of a continuous operating nitritation reactor treating 
lagoon supernatant with high ammonium to nitrite conversion rate (> 95%) was used as the 
NO 2--N source. The molar r atio of NO 2--N (effluent from nitritation reactor) to NH 4+-N 
(from raw lagoon supernatant) was maintained at 1.32:1.   
A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) mode was applied in the anammox reactor.  Each SBR 
cycle was 12 hours, which included 20 min feed, 11 h reaction, 30 min settle, 5 min 
withdrawal, and 5 min idle. The exchange ratio for each SBR cycle was kept at 20%, which 
resulted in a hydraulic retention time of 2.5 days. The reactor had a double jacket to 
maintain constant temperature at 30 °C.  37 
 3.2.4. S ample collection and analytical methods  
Reactor influent and effluent were sampled every 2 -3 days during the operation. Water 
quality including the concentrations of NH 4+-N, NO 3--N, and NO 2--N were measured with 
Hach kits (10205, 10206 and 10207, respectively, Loveland, Colorado). Chemical oxygen 
demand (COD) and 5 -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) were measured according 
to Standard Methods ( (APHA, 2005 ); 5220D, 5210B, respectively). Collected samples 
were filtered (0.45 μm pore) and analyzed within 2 h of collection for COD, inorganic 
nitrogen concentrations (Shao et al., 2017 ). The biomass in the carriers was measured using 
methods from Wells et al. (2017 ). The contribution of the anammox bacteria and 
heterotrophic denitrification processes on the nitrogen remo val was determined according 
to Ruscalleda et al. (2008 ). 
3.2.5. Specific anammox activity (SAA) tests  
The anaerobic ammonia oxidation rates of biofilm and flocs  were performed. Biomass 
samples were obtained at a biofilm to sludge volume ratio of 40 biocarriers: 350 mL sludge 
under the steady -state conditions in each phase and washed with phosphate buffer to 
remove residual compounds. The biomass samples were transferred to batch reactors filled 
with 350 mL substrate solutions containing NH 4Cl and NaN O2 at concentrations of 70 mg 
NH 4+-N/L and 95 mg NO 2--N/L. Three sets of batch experiments were performed for each 
collection, including flocs  only, biofilm only, and abiotic control (no biofilm or flocs  ). All 
sets were performed in triplicates. The O 2 was removed by purging nitrogen gas for 20 min, 
and the batch reactor bottles were immediately sealed with butyl rubber and placed in a 
shaker at 31 ± 1 °C and 180 rpm. Samples were collected along reaction time. The NH 4+-38 
 N and NO 2--N uptake rates were deter mined using the linear regression of concentration 
over time divided by the biomass, a method previously demonstrated (Bassin et al., 2012 ).  
3.2.6. q -PCR analysis and 16S rRNA gene sequencing  
Biofilm and floc samples were collected for genomic DNA extraction under steady -state 
conditions of each operation phase, on days 80 (Phase I), 160 (Phase II) and 255 (Phase 
III). DNA was extracted using MO BIO Pow erSoil® DNA Isolation Kits (MoBio 
Laboratories Inc, Carlsbad, California), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  
Population of anammox bacteria and denitrification bacteria were determined by qPCR 
targeting AMX nirS gene for anammox (Li et al., 2011 ), and nosZ  (Kim et al., 2011 ) and 
narG  (Kandeler et al., 2006 ) genes for denitrification using qPCR kits (Bio -Rad 
Laboratories, Mississauga , Ontario). Information about the primers and qPCR reaction 
conditions is shown in Table A -1 (Appendix A). The qPCR amplification program for each 
gene is summarized in Table A -2 (Appendix A).  
Extracted DNA samples were sent to a commercial lab for 16S rR NA gene sequencing on 
an Illumine MiSeq platform at the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX, USA) 
to determine bacterial community diversity and composition. The V3 -V4 regions of 16S 
rRNA genes were amplified using primer set 357wF (CCT ACG GGN GG C WGC AG) 
and 785R (GAC TAC HVG GGT ATC TAA TCC). Sequencing data processing and 
taxonomic classification were analyzed using QIIME pipelines (Caporaso et al., 2010) with 
references in the Silva database. The alpha -diversity, beta -diversity, and principal 
coordinates analysis (PCoA) were performed using the “vegan” package in RStudio (Jari 
Oksanen et al., 2017 ). 
3.2.7. Statistical analysis  39 
 T-test and single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a 5% probability level were 
performed, and were reported as p -values.  
3.3. Results and discussion  
3.3.1 Reactor performance  
Figure 3.1A shows the concentrations of NH 4+, NO 2- and NO 3- in the influent and effluent 
over the period of 259 days. During phase I (day 0 - day 83), the total NH 4+-N removal 
efficiency of over 94% was consistently recorded (Figure 3.1B). The NO 2--N removal 
efficiency varied between 93% and 98%. The NO 3--N concentration was 48.9 ± 4.5 
mgNO 3--N/L, which was produced as part of the NO 2- was oxidised to NO 3- to provide 
electrons for carbon fixation during anammox reaction. The ratio of NO 3--N gene rated to 
NH 4+-N oxidized was 0.21 ± 0.04 during phase I (Figure 3.1B), which is lower than the 
theoretical ratio of 0.26 based on the anammox kinetics (Strous et al., 1998 ); indicating the 
existence of nitrat e reduction through denitrification. Under the phase II conditions (day 
84 - day 162), the NH 4+-N removal efficiency at the steady state slightly decreased to 89 ± 
3.2% (P > 0.05).  
In phase III, effluent from a partial nitrification react or treating lagoon supernatant was 
used as the nitrite source.  As shown in Figure 3.1B, the total NH 4+-N nitrogen removal 
efficiency (87 ± 2.9%)  was not significantly affected (P > 0.05). The effluent contained 
36.2 ± 17, 30.8 ± 12, and 68.4 ± 12 mg/L as NH 4+-N, NO 2--N and NO 3--N, respectively. 
The ratio of NO 3--N generated to NH 4+-N oxidized was 0.17 ± 0.02 (Figure 3.1B).  This is 
slightly lower than in phase II, however, it was not significantly different (P > 0.05) even 
though the COD i ncreased from 305 ± 55 to 583 ± 75 mg/L.

 The NO 3- consumption by denitrification was gradually increased thro ugh all phases. The 
COD removal efficiency was 12 ± 2.4% in phase I and increased to 20 ± 2.1 % (P < 0.05)   
in phase II. The COD removal efficiency in Phase III was 22 ± 2.7%, which was 
comparable with that in phase II (P > 0.05). Although the presence of  heterotrophic 
denitrifiers helps to control effluent NO 3- concentration and COD impacts, extensive 
growth of denitrifiers can lead to the reduced anammox activities through competition of 
the common nitrogen source (NO 2-).  In an IFAS configuration, contr olling flocs  
concentration helps to maintain anammox activities and eliminate competition between 
denitrifiers and anammox bacteria. In our study, the flocs  concentration was maintained at 
428 mg/L (Phase I), 645 mg/L (Phase II) and 805 mg/L (Phase III), t hrough controlling the 
settling time and volume exchange ratio during SBR operation.  
Table 3. 1 shows the relative contribution of anammox bacteria and heterotrophic 
denitrification on the nitrogen removal. The average inorganic nitrogen removal percentage 
in phase I, phase II and phase III by the anammox route were 97.2 ± 2.4%, 94.8 ± 1.6% 
and 91.4  ± 2.8%, respectively, while heterotrophic denitrification contributions in Phase I, 
phase II and phase III were 2.8 ± 2.3%, 5.2 ± 1.9% and 8.6 ± 2.7%, respectively.

 42 
 The calculated COD removal based on denitrification stoichiometry (Supplementary 
information) were similar to the measured COD removal (Appendix B Figure B -3.2), 
indicating that COD consumption contributed to the heterotrophic nitrogen (e.g. NO 3--N 
and NO 2--N) removal, which verified the calculations of inorganic nitrogen removal 
contribution by anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers.  
The IFAS system seemed to have established higher res istance to organic substrates in 
phase III, which could be linked to the acclimatization of anammox bacteria, the higher 
biomass content in the reactor, and impact of co -existence of biofilm and flocs . These 
factors are discussed in the following sections.  
3.3.2 Biomass content and specific anammox activity (SAA)  
Figure 3.2A shows the total biomass content in biofilms and flocs . Biofilm biomass 
increased from 3.7 g in phase I to 5.1 g and 5.2 g in phases II and III, respectively. The 
flocs  biomass in the reactor increased from 2.4 g in phase I to 2.9 g in phase II, and further 
increased to 3.8 g in phase III. Overall, biofilm biomass was higher than the flocs  biomass, 
which may be attributed to the longer solid retention time of biofilm microorganisms which 
supported the growth of slow growing bacteria and retaining more biomass. Figure 3.2B 
shows the specific anammox activities (SAA) of biomass in biofilm and flocs  during 
different operation phases. Under all conditions, the SAA of biofilm biomass was higher 
than that of the flocs  biomass, indicating that the anammox activity mainly took place in 
the biofilm. Anammox bacteria are slow growing microbes, which are better retain ed in 
the biofilm with higher cell retention time (Fernández et al., 2008 ).  43 
  
 
Figure 3.2.  (A) Total biomass contents in biofilm and flocs ; (B) specific anammox 
activity in biofilm and flocs . 
 
From phase I to II, the SAA increased significantly in biofilm from 0.16 to 0.25 kg N/kg 
VSS/d (P < 0.05, Figure 3.2B). The increase in biomass and SAA was associated with the 
increase of NH 4+-N and NO 2--N in the feed, indicating active growth of anammox bacteria 
in the biofilm. In flocs , the slight increase of biomass content and SAA (0. 06 to 0.08 kg 
N/kg VSS/d) could have resulted from detachment of biofilm. The COD increase from 
44 
 phase I to II did not inhibit microbial growth and anammox activities, but led to a decrease 
in the ratio of NO 3--N generated to NH 4+-N oxidized, indicating den itrification activities.  
In phase III, the SAA of biofilm (0.24 kg N/kg VSS/d) was comparable with phase II, while 
the SAA in the flocs  decreased to 0.03 kg N/kg VSS/d. Since NH 4+-N and NO 2--N 
concentrations in the feed only changed slightly while COD con centration increased 
significantly, the SAA decrease in flocs  was probably due to the high COD loading. In 
phase III, it is possible that the COD promoted denitrifier growth in flocs , which competed 
with anammox bacteria. As a result, anammox activity in flocs  was more easily affected 
than in biofilm. Accordingly, th e flocs  biomass content was higher in phase III than in 
phase II due to growth of denitrifiers. The total specific COD reduction rate increased 
gradually from phase I to phase III (Appendix  B Figure B -3.1), confirming that  
heterotrophic activity was enhanced.  
Previous studies showed that both of the anammox activity and population were 
significantly decreased when COD increased. For instance, an anammox  lab -scale up -flow 
anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor fed with ei ther UASB -post-digested pig manure 
or the effluent after partial oxidation showed enhanced denitrification and reduced 
anammox activities under higher COD loadings (Molinuevo et al., 2009 ).  Tang et al. (2010 ) 
reported the activities of anammox bacterial were largely suppressed by denitrifiers under 
high organic loading conditions (400-600 mg/L of COD concentration in the influent) in 
high-rate anammox UASB reactor. In the present study, the average COD removals in 
Phases II (74 mg/L) and III (128 mg/L) were lower than the BOD5 concentrations (103 
mg/L and 165 mg/L, respectively), i ndicating heterotrophic denitrification was not limited 
by the available BOD 5 (Ruscalleda et a l., 2008 ). Results in our study showed that the 45 
 anammox bacteria activity in the biofilm was not affected either in phase II (305 mg/L 
COD, 103 mg/L BOD 5) and phase III (583 mg/L COD, 165 mg/L BOD 5). . This 
observation may be explained by the presence o f flocs  in the system which consumed 
organic substrates more efficiently and protected the biofilm from high organic substrate 
loading.  
3.3.3. of functional genes by qPCR  
The Quantification quantitative real -time PCR analysis was performed to quantify the 
abundances of anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers in the biofilm and flocs . As 
shown in Figure 3.3A, the amount of anammox functional genes (AMX nirS) increased in 
both biofilm a nd flocs  (P < 0.05) as the NH 4+-N and NO 2--N feeding concentration 
increased from phase I to phase II. The abundance of anammox AMX nirS in the biofilm 
increased from 1.15 × 107 to 3.76 × 107 copies/mgVSS in phase II (Figure 3.3A). This 
confirmed that good anammox activity was established at this high ammonium condition. 
The flocs  exhibited a lower abundance of AMX nirS than within biofilm (P < 0.05), but a 
similar increasing trend from phase I (2.12 × 106 copies/mgVSS) to phase II (4.52 × 106 
copies/mgVSS). The absolute quantity of anammox bacteria in biofilm was much higher 
than in flocs , which is in agreement with the anammox activity test results (Figure 3.2B); 
this is supported by both the  higher abundance of biofilm AMX nirS, and a higher biofilm 
biomass concentration (Figure 3.2A) when compared to that of flocs . 46 
  
 
Figure 3.3.  qPCR results of (A) functional anammox gene AMX nirS; (B) functional 
denitrification gens nosZ  and narG  in diffe rent phases in biofilm and flocs . 
 
In phase III, the AMX nirS in biofilm remained at a similar level (3.68×107 copies/mgVSS) 
as in phase II. However, AMX nirS in flocs  reduced to 3.30×106 copies/mgVSS. These 
results confirmed that raw nitritation reactor effluent had a greater affect than synthetic 
nitrite on anammox bacteria in flocs . 
47 
 Figure 3.3B shows the gene copy numbers of heterotrophic denitrifiers in biofilm and flocs , 
based on funct ional genes nosZ  and narG . In the biofilm, the gene copy numbers of nosZ  
and narG  did not change significantly (P > 0.05); rather, from phase I to phase III they 
slightly increased from 2.08×107 to 2.40×107 copies/mgVSS bi omass and from 9.80×106 
to 1.28×107 copies/mgVSS biomass, respectively.  
In the flocs , the abundances of the denitrification genes nosZ  and narG  both increased 
significantly (P < 0.05), from 3.68×107 to 4.48×107 copies/mgVSS biomass and 2.08×107 
to 3.98×107 copies/mgVSS biomass, respectively. The abundance of nosZ  in the flocs  
further increased significantly to 5.68×107 copies/mgVSS biomass (P < 0.05) in phase III 
while the narG  in the flocs  rema ined relatively stabilized with no significant difference (P > 
0.05). Comparison between biofilm and flocs  revealed that anammox bacteria resided 
mostly in the biofilm, while more denitrifiers resided in the flocs . The changes through 
different operation p hases confirmed that higher organic substrates resulted in higher 
abundances of heterotrophic denitrifiers and lower anammox bacteria in the flocs . 
Other studies have shown that high concentrations of organic matters inhibited anammox 
activity. For example , COD concentrations higher than 300 mg/L or COD/N ratios higher 
than two suppressed anammox activity in low -N-strength wastewater (Chamchoi et al., 
2008 ). In high -N-strength wastewater similar with phase I in our study, high COD showed 
an instant loss in anammox activity; at COD/NO 2--N ratio of 2.92, the anammox activity 
nearly ceased (Tang et al., 2010 ). Increasing the COD/N ratio from 0.6 to 1.4 led to a 
decreased anammox activity in a flocs  reactor (Jenni et al., 2014 ); whereas in granular 
sludge system the COD/N ratio had less impact on the anammox activity at values below 
3.1 (Ni et al., 2012 ). In the present study, the COD/N ratio (ranging from 0.58 to 1.34) was 48 
 lower than the inhibitory levels reported in literature. Our study showed an increase in 
COD/N ratio only caused marginal reduction in anammox activity in the biofilm, but 
significantly reduced anammox activity of flocs . This observation may be attributed to the 
presence of  active denitrifiers in flocs  and thus mitigated the organic carbon impacts on 
anammox activities in biofilm biomass. In addition, as compared to the flocs , biofilm is 
often reported to be more resistant towards environmental stress due to its unique 
architectural features (Sheng and Liu, 2011 ; Sheng et al., 2015 ). Overall, it appeared that 
anammox bacteria in biof ilm may benefit from heterotrophic bacteria in flocs  under 
conditions of high COD loading.  
3.3.4 Microbial community diversity  
The microbial community during each operation phase was investigated via 16S rRNA 
gene sequencing analysis. The alpha -diversity  indices (Shannon diversity, observed genera, 
Chao 1, ACE and Pielou’s evenness) varied between different operation phases and 
between the biofilm and flocs  (Table 3. 2). The alpha -diversity of biofilm community 
increased after raising the proportion of lagoon supernatant in the feeding water from 25% 
(phase I) to 50% (phase II), indicating that the microbial community has developed with 
higher richness and evenness. In flocs , the Shannon diversity and Pielou’s evenness slightly 
decreased from phase II to III, while other indices slightly increased. Comparing biofilm 
and flocs , the latter appeared to have higher alpha -diversity, though it was not significant 
(P>0.05). The  increased concentration of lagoon supernatant increased the complexity of 
the microbial community structure, probably due to the complex composition of the 
feeding water containing various organic carbon substrates, nutrients, and rare 
microorganisms (Shao et al., 2019 ). Other studies also showed that microbial communities 49 
 in anammox reactor are more diverse when fed with real ammonium -rich wastewater than 
synthetic ammonium -rich wastewater (Wagner and Loy, 2002 ).  
Table 3. 2. Alpha -diversity indices in different operation phases of microbial communities

The beta -diversity among samples was analyzed using Bray -Curtis distance and presented 
in principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plot (Figure 3.4). The biofilm and flocs  
communities were clearly differentiated along the PCoA1 axis (80.7% of total variance),  
indicating segregated microbial communities. In biofilm, a shift was shown from phase I 
to II, then remained unchanged in phase III indicating that a stable community had been 
developed in phase II and was not affected by the changes in feed water in phas e III. In 
flocs , the large distance between phase II and III suggests that its microbial community 
was changed more dramatically, probably due to the feeding composition changes.  50

biofilm phases I, II, and III, and flocs  phases II and III.  
 
3.3.5 Taxonomic analysis   
The relative abundances of microbial taxa were demonstrated at the phylum (Figure 3.5A) 
and genus (Figure 3.5B) levels. In the biofilm samples, the phylum Ignavibacteriae  (24.6 -
47.3%) was most predominant, followed by Planctomycetes  (17.6 -22.2%), Chloroflexi  
(10.0 –10.5%), Bacterioidetes  (6.0–9.4%), Proteobacteria (5.7–9.3%), and Chlorobi  (3.6-
8.1%). The most abundant phylum in flocs  samples was Bacteroidetes (41.6% -44.9%). 
Ignavibacteriae (12.6 -16.3%) was the second most abundant phylum. Similar to the 
biofilm communities, Proteobacteria (11.8 -13.4%),  Chloroflexi (2.9-3.6%),  Chlorobi (0.7-
3.1%),  and Planctomycetes (0.7-0.8%) were also abundant. The relative abundance of 
Planctomycetes , which was related to anammox bacteria, was notably enriched from phase 
I (17.6%) to phase II (22.2%) in the biofilm, and remained a t high level (21.2%) in phase 
51 
 III. In flocs , Planctomycetes  only took up 0.8% and 0.7% in phase II and phase III, 
respectively. Other studies also showed that members of phyla other than Planctomycetes , 
namely Proteobacteria, Bacterioidetes, Chlorobi , and Chloroflexi  were present in 
anammox bioreactors (Gonzalez -Gil et al., 2015 ; Gonzalez -Martinez et al., 2015 ).  
 
Figure 3.5.  (A) Relative taxonomic abundances of microbial community at phylum level 
with average relative abundance >1%; (B) assemblage of highest 10 genera from each 
sample.  
 
52 
 At the genus level, Candidatus Brocadia in the phylum Planctomycetes  was the 
predominant i dentified anammox bacteria (Figure 3.5B), taking up 15.7%, 19.5%, and 18.9% 
of biofilm communities in Phases I, II, and III, respectively, and only 0.3% of flocs  in 
Phases II and III. Research showed that anammox bacteria tend to live in biofilm in 
nitrita tion-anammox bioreactors (Vlaeminck et al., 2010 ; Speth et al., 2016 ).  
Uncultured bacterium in PHOS -HE36 (phylum Ignavibacteriae ) were the highest abundant 
genus in biofilm phase I and second highest abundant in the other samples, which was 
previously reported in denitrifying communities (Dabert et al., 2001 ; Koenig et al., 2005 ). 
PHOS -HE36 decreased from phase I (38.2%) to phase II (16.6%), indicating that the 
biofilm community favored the growth of anammox bacteria than heterotrophic denitrifers. 
Uncultured bacterium in PHOS -HE51 (phylum Bacterioidetes ) was the most ab undant 
genus in the flocs  communities, which was also related to denitrifying populations (Dabert 
et al., 2001 ). PHOS -HE51 increased f rom 18.2% in phase II to 23.7% in phase III in flocs , 
indicating its enrichment under high COD loadings. Other increased genera include 
uncultured env.OPS_17, uncultured Fimbriimonadaceae , Ferruginibacter , Woodsholea , 
and uncultured Chitinophagaceae . Decre ased genera include uncultured PHOS -HE36, 
Ignavibacterium , uncultured OPB35_soil_group, uncultured Blastocatellaceae  (Subgroup 
4), uncultured Saprospiraceae , and Gemmatimonas.  
The differences between biofilm and flocs  community compositions demonstrated bi omass 
segregation between biofilm and flocs : anammox bacteria residing in the biofilm while 
heterotrophic denitrifiers predominating the flocs . This segregation was related with 
different solid retention times, substrate accessibility, and interaction betw een the two 
matrices (Winkler et al., 2011 ; Hubaux et al., 2015 ). Flocs  have more efficient access to 53 
 substrates whereas biofilm allows sufficient retention time for the slow -growing bacteria. 
Previo us studies of one -stage PN/A systems have shown that IFAS systems enriched fast -
growing microorganisms in the flocs  and anammox bacteria in the biofilm (Laureni et al., 
2019 ); Our results also showed higher anammox bacteria in the biofilm than in flocs , 
consistent with these IFAS studies. Moreover, the flocs  in our reactor showed beneficial 
impacts on b iofilm when dealing with complex feedings containing high nitrogen and high 
COD. It is suggested that the flocs  play important roles in maintaining stability and 
resistance of anammox systems treating high -strength real wastewater and should not be 
neglected in operational and modeling practices (Volcke et al., 2012 ; Park et al., 2015 ). 
3.4. Conclusions  
This study demonstrated that anammox IFAS reactor was successfully treated ammonia -
rich digester sludge thickening lagoon supernatant, reaching ammonia removal efficiencies 
higher than 88% at steady state. Switching from synthetic nitrite feeding to real n itritation 
effluent feeding led to a significant COD increase without reducing the anammox removal 
efficiency, reaching a 87% removal under the steady state condition. This suggests that the 
anammox IFAS reactor is a feasible system for treating ammonia -rich digester effluent.  
Microbial activities and community compositions revealed that anammox bacteria 
(Candidatus Brocadia) mainly resided in the biofilm while flocs  harbored mainly 
heterotrophic denitrifiers. The microbial temporal changes during different  operation 
phases and responses to high organic content loading in Phase III showed that the anammox 
activity was only suppressed in flocs  but not in biofilm. The flocs  community functioned 
as a major denitrification player and a protection barrier against  high COD inputs to 
maintain anammox activities in the biofilm. The biofilm - flocs  hybrid system benefits from 54 
 the segregation of microbial communities and is advantageous in treating high organic 
content ammonia -rich wastewaters.

 CHAPTER 4 ANAMMOX REACTOR OPTIMIZATION FOR THE 
TREATMENT OF AMMONIUM RICH DIGESTATE LAGOON 
SUPERNATANT -STEP FEEDING MITIGATES NITRITE INHIBITION2 
4.1. Introduction  
The presence of high ammonia nitrogen (NH 4+-N) concentration (i.e., 800 –1200 mg L-1) 
in the digestate lagoon supernatant  can cause serious eutrophication problems in receiving 
waters (Zhang et al., 201 3) and thus requires efficient nitrogen reduction treatment before 
discharge (Dapena -Mora et al., 2004; Shao et al., 2018) . However, conventional 
nitrification/ heterotrophic denitr ification process is energy intensive, and the low organic 
carbon in the lagoon supernatant cannot support denitrification treatment (Shao et al., 2018) . 
Anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) coupled with partial nitritation 
(nitritation/anammox) has emerged as an efficient alternative to treat ammonia rich 
wastewater streams. In the first of a two -stage  process, ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) 
convert ammonium (NH 4+) to nitrite (NO 2-) by consuming oxygen (O 2) from the 
surrounding environment. Following the first stage, anammox bacteria anaerobically 
oxidize NH 4+ using NO 2- as the electron acceptor, generating nitrogen gas (N 2) (Strous et 
al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2015a) . The oxygen requirement for the nitritation/anammox 
process is 60 % less than for conventi onal nitrification/denitrification (Lackner et al., 2014) , 
as only 50% of the NH 4+ is oxidized to NO 2- ions a erobically, while the rest is converted 
to nitrogen gas via anammox. Therefore, the process can consequently contribute to the

 economical and effective operation of wastewater treatment plants (Mulder, 2003; van 
Loosdrecht and Salem, 2006; Siegrist et al., 2008; Eskicioglu et al.,  2018) .  
Although nitritation/anammox processes have been applied at the pilot - and full -scale level 
treating ammonia -rich anaerobic digestate liquor, limited studies have reported on the 
treatment of digestate lagoon supernatant using this process. Compared to the  digestate, 
which has a long storage time (4 -6 months) in the lagoon for thickening, lagoon supernatant 
has a lower biodegradable chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids and 
temperature, a higher pH, and a more diverse slow -growing microbial communi ty (Shao et 
al., 2019) .   
Considering the long doubling time of anammox bacteria, most frequently studied 
anammox reactor configurations for this process are biofilm -based (granules or carrier 
biofilms), includi ng up -flow granular anammox sludge bed reactors (Abma et al., 2010) , 
moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR) (Rosenwinkel and Cornelius, 2005) , fluidized bed 
biofilm reactors (Ma et al., 2017) , membrane biological nutrient removal reactor (Wang et 
al., 2019)  and rotating biological contactors (Egli et al., 2001) . Lately, the integrated fixed -
biofilm activated sludge reactor (I FAS) has been studied as a promising option to 
implement  the nitritation/anammox process for high ammonia strength wastewater 
treatment. By introducing flocs  to biofilm -based reactors, IFAS may offer various 
engineering advantages, such as extended biomass  retention times  from the biofilm 
configuration (Zhang et al., 2015a; Huang et al., 2016; Arias et al., 2018) , and  improved  
substrate transfer from the suspended sludge configuration  (Ding et al., 2018) . Importantly 
for nitrogen -reducti on, repression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in the flocs  and a 
segregation of anammox bacteria and AOB provided by IFAS could also facilitate the 63 
 nitritation/anammox process (Zhang et al., 2015a) . However, other than the comparison 
with biofilm -only systems ( i.e., MBBR), limited information is available regarding the 
process stability evaluation and IFAS operation optimization for high ammonia strength 
wastewater treatment (a total of 3 publications based on the search from “web of science” 
database), with a resea rch focus on the COD/N ratio (Wang et al., 2018a) , residual 
ammonium (Yang et al., 2017)  or temperature (Dong et al., 2016) . High concentration of 
nitrite can lead to irreversible inhibition ( i.e., toxicity) of the anammox bacteria by causing 
imbalance in cell mass transport and proton gradient (Li et al., 2017) , or reversible 
inhibition on certain metabolic activities (Qiao et al., 2017) . The mechanisms of nitrite 
inhibition was also regarded to be via the form of free nitrous acid (FNA, HNO 2) 
(Fernández et al. (2012) , which can diffuse across the cell membrane. Under high 
concentration of FNA co nditions, FNA can change the pH in the cell and neutralize the 
transmembrane potential which causes cell death (Kadam et al., 1994) .  
Our current research was undertaken to investigate the impact of reactor operation on  the 
IFAS anammox process, treating digestate lagoon supernatant. Sequencing batch reactor 
(SBR) operation strategies were adopted. Nitrite inhibition was monitored when changing 
the operational hydraulic retention time (HRT) and step feeding was applied a fter inhibition 
occurred.  Bioreactor treatment performance, microbial population dynamics, and 
anammox activities under different HRTs and feeding strategies were evaluated and 
compared.    
4.2. Materials and methods  
4.2.1. Reactor setup and operation  64 
 A laboratory scale integrated fixed -biofilm activated sludge sequencing batch reactor 
(IFAS -SBR)  reactor (6 L working volume) was operated for 339 days. The reactor was 
initially seeded with AnoxTM K5 carriers, kindly provided by Veolia, with a 55% volume 
fill ratio ( i.e., volume ratio of biocarriers and total reactor volume). The reactor influent 
was a mixture of (i) raw lagoon supernatant from a biosolids digestate thickening lagoon 
in the City of Edmonton and (ii) the effluent of a continuously operating n itritation reactor 
treating raw lagoon supernatant. Raw lagoon supernatant was sampled once a month from 
the lagoon and stored in a 4 C cold room (Shao et al., 2018) . The molar ratio of NO 2--N 
(from nitritation reactor effluent) to NH 4+-N (from raw lagoon supernatant) in the reactor 
feed water was maintained at 1.32:1 based on the anammox biochemistry indicated in 
equation (1) (Strous et al., 1997) . The water characteristics of raw lagoon supern atant, 
nitritation reactor effluent, and anammox reactor influent are summarized in Table 4.1.  
A peristaltic pump ( masterflex,  Cole -Parmer, Illinois, USA) automated with an electronic 
timer was used for influent filling. A thermostatic jacket (Xuanyuan, Ya ncheng, China) 
was used to keep the reactor inside temperature at 30 ± 1 °C. A mechanical stirrer (Grainger, 
USA) was employed in the reactor reaction stage to blend the flocs, carriers and liquid 
thoroughly. The operation of reactor can be divided into fo ur phases with their HRTs and 
feeding mode. As shown in Table 4.2, in Phase I (HRT = 2.5 d, days 1 -90) and Phase II 
(HRT = 1.7 d, days 91 -190), the reactor feed volume exchange ratio (VEX, the ratio of 
feed volume added to the reactor each cycle and the re actor working volume) was fixed at 
20%. In Phase I, each SBR cycle was 12 hours, which included 15 min filling, 11 h anoxic 
reaction, 30 min settling, 5 min decant, and 10 min idle. Thus the reactor HRT was 2.5 d 
in Phase I. The operating cycle in Phase II  was 8 hours which included 15 min filling, 7 h 65 
 anoxic reaction, 30 min settling, 5 min decant and 10 min idle and thus the HRT was 
reduced to 1.7 days by running three cycles each day. Starting from day 191 (Phase III), 
the HRT was further reduced to 1.2 days by increasing VEX to 28% also with an operating 
cycle length of 8 hours. In Phase IV (days 280 -339), a step -feed approach was applied for 
the SBR operation with the HRT maintained at 1.2 days, where an 8 h operating cycle 
included a 7.5 min filling fo llowed by a 4 h anoxic reaction, another 7.5 min filling 
followed by 3 h anoxic reaction, 30 min settling, 5 min decant and 10 min idle. Thus the 
total amount of influent that used in Phase III was distributed equally to be fed at the 
beginning and after 4  h anoxic reaction of the operating cycle in Phase IV respectively. The 
reactor pH was controlled at the anammox bacteria favored range of 7.5 -7.8 by periodical 
addition of diluted hydrochloric acid. The feed was flushed with nitrogen gas at least 1 h 
per day. Anaerobic conditions were maintained by keeping the reactor sealed and gas outlet 
tubing submerged.

4.2.2. Sample collection and analytical methods  
Reactor water samples were collected 2 -3 times per week for water quality including COD, 
NO3--N, NO 2--N and NH 4+-N concentration measurement with Hach reagent kits (methods 
8000, 10205, 10206, and 10207, respectively, Hach Company, USA) (Nze et al., 2018) . 
The inorganic nitrogen was calculated as the summation of NO 3--N, NO 2--N and NH 4+-N

The nitrogen species mass balance is calculated based on the influent and effluent inorganic 
nitrogen concentrations. The average of nitrogen removal routes by anammox bacteria and 
heterotrophic denitrification was determined according to equations 1 (Chamchoi et al., 
2008; Ruscalleda et al., 2008) . FNA concentrations were determined based on the equation 
from Anthonisen et al. (1976) .   
Further water quality tests within one SBR cycle ( i.e., cycle test) were performed to 
evaluate the kinetics of NO 2--N and NH 4+-N depletion or NO 3--N accumulation in  different 67 
 phases. Water samples were subjected to measurement after being filtrated by 0.45 μm pore 
filters within 2 h of sample collection. Biomass of flocs  and biofilm was sampled for 
measurement weekly following the volatile suspended solids (VSS) anal ysis method 
(Eaton et al., 2011) . 
4.2.3. Specific anammox activity (SAA) analysis  
The specific anammox activity (SAA) of flocs  and biofilm on the carriers under steady 
state conditions were analyzed with the procedure described by Jin et al (2012) . 400 mL 
serum bottles with a liquid volume of 350 mL were adopted for the batch study. Biofilm 
and flocs  samples were obtained from the continuously oper ating reactor according to the 
biocarrier volume fill ratio, which was 40 biocarriers every 350 mL mixed liquor in each 
bottle. The collected biofilm and floc samples were washed separately with phosphate 
buffer for three times before resuspended in 350 mL  mineral medium containing 95 mg L-
1 of NO 2--N and 70 mg L-1 of NH 4+-N. Hydrochloric acid was used to adjust the medium 
pH to about 7.5. Anoxic conditions were established by purging nitrogen (99.9% purity) in 
the serum bottles for 20 min before sealing th e bottles with butyl rubbers and incubating 
them in a thermostatic shaker (180 rpm) at 31 ± 1 °C. Samples were taken for N species  
analyses periodically without disturbing the anoxic condition. The SAA was calculated as 
the ratio of maximum substrate consumption rate and biomass concentration. All batch 
studies were performed in triplicate.  
4.2.4. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis  
The biomass samples of flocs  and biofilm were collected from the reactor under the steady -
state condition in each operating phase for DNA extraction using MO BIO PowerSoil® 
DNA Isolation Kits. The extracted DNA was subjected to the qPCR analyses using a 68 
 CFX96TM real-time PCR detection system (Bio -RAD, USA) with the target genes of 
anammox bacter ia and denitrification bacteria (Kim et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2016) . 
Information on qPCR primers for target genes, and qPCR reaction details is provided in 
Table A -1 and A -2 (Appendix A).  
Gene copy numbers were calculated as the relative values of those known plasmid DNA 
standard concentrations compared to the threshold cycle values obtained in every single 
qPCR run (Lü et al., 2013) . The qPCR reaction without DNA template served as the control 
and was conducted for every targ et gene. All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate.  
4.2.5. Statistical significance  
Statistical analyses were conducted using Microsoft Excel® single factor analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) function, and were recorded as p values, which indicate statist ical 
significance under a 5% probability.  
4.3. Results and discussion  
4.3.1. Performance of the anammox reactor  
Throughout the IFAS -SBR’s 339 day operation, the influent NH 4+-N concentration 
(420 ± 12 mg L-1), NO 2--N concentration (543 ±  20 mg L-1), and NO 3--N concentration 
(13.2 ±  2.6 mg L-1) were maintained (Figure 4.1) whereby the inorganic N loading rate 
(NLR) experienced a proportional increase as the HRT decreased, which was 0.38  ± 0.00 
kg m-3 d-1 in Phase I (90 days, HRT = 2.5 d), 0.61 ±  0.02 k g m-3 d-1 in Phase II (100 days, 
HRT = 1.7 d), 0.80 ±  0.01 kg m-3 d-1 in Phase III (89 days, HRT = 1.2 d), and 0.84 ±  0.01 
kg m-3 d-1 in Phase IV (60 days, HRT = 1.2 d) (Table 4.2).  
The change of HRT significantly affected NH 4+-N and NO 2--N removal effici ency and 
NO 3--N accumulation (Figure 4.1 and Appendix B Figure B -4.1). 69

In Phase I, the effluent NH 4+-N and NO 2--N concentrations were stabilized at 50.2 ±  5.7 
and 30.1 ±  3.4 mg L-1 respectively, with NH 4+-N and NO 2--N removal efficiencies of 88.0 
± 1.4% and 94.2 ± 0.6% respectively.  
Meanwhile, an average of 80.6 ±  4.0 mg L-1 of NO 3--N accumulation occurred as a res ult 
of the generation from anammox reaction and the reduction from heterotrophic 
denitrification (Gilbert et al., 2014) . Lagoon supernatant contains low levels of COD, 
which may facilitate the growth of heterotrophic denitrification activity by providing the 
external organic carbon source to the denitrifiers (indicated by18.0 ± 5.8% COD reduction 
in Phase I, as shown in Appendix B Figure B -4.2), consequently leading to a lower 
observed NO 3--N accumulation.

efficiency.  
 
However, anammox was still the major route for the observed nitrogen reduction because 
denitrifiers cannot outcompete anammox bacteria under such low C/N ratio (< 1) 
conditions (Sobieszuk and Szewczyk, 2006) . Further, as a means to measure the extent of 
anammox process (Trigo et al., 2006) , the stoichiometric ratio of NO 2--N conversion and 
NH 4+-N oxidat ion (R 1) and the stoichiometric ratio of NO 3--N accumulation and NH 4+-N 
oxidation (R 2) were 1.33 ± 0.05 and 0.22 ± 0.01, respectively. This also points to the co -
existence of dominant anammox activity and limited heterotrophic denitrification, by 
comparing  with the theoretic values (equation (1)) (Strous et al., 1997)  which were 1.32 
and 0.26, respectivel y. Further stoichiometric estimation showed that 95.5 ± 1.2% of 
inorganic nitrogen removal was through anammox process (Table 4.3). Therefore, the 
average total inorganic nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was 81.6 ± 0.7% and the 
inorganic nitrogen removal r ate (NRR) was 0.31 ±  0.01 kg m-3 d-1 in Phase I (Table 4.2), 
both of which were in the favorable range for IFAS configuration anammox process 
performance (Zhang et al., 2015a) .  
When the HRT was reduced from 2.5 d (Phase I) to 1.7 d (Phase II), an adaptation period 
(days 91 -140) was observed due to the operation condition change ( i.e., HRT and NLR), 
which imposed selecti ve pressure on the microbes (Costa et al., 2014) . After that, the 
effluent NH 4+-N and NO 2--N concentrations steadily decreased to 41.2 ± 7.5 mg L-1 and 
29.1 ± 4.1 mg L-1, respectively, with the NH 4+-N and NO 2--N removal  efficiencies of 90.5 
± 1.8% and 95.2 ± 0.7%, respectively, which were slightly higher than (p < 0.01 for NH 4+-72 
 N and p = 0.02 for NO 2--N) that in Phase I, suggesting a slight improvement in anammox 
activity (R 1 reached 1.32 ± 0.04). Meanwhile, the NO 3--N accumulation decreased 
significantly (p < 0.01) to 57.6 ±  3.1 mg L-1 (R2 = 0.15 ± 0.01), accompanied with an 
elevated COD degradation (26.2 ±  2.1%) (Appendix B Figure B -4.2). The stoichiometry 
analysis also indi cated that the anammox process slightly increased the removal 
efficiencies of NH 4+-N and NO 2--N, and the heterotrophic denitrification process 
contributed to higher removal efficiency of NO 3--N (Table 4.3). Heterotrophic 
denitrification contribution to the  total inorganic nitrogen removal was increased from 4.5 
± 1.4% (phase I) to 8.0 ± 1.1% (phase II). Our observation indicates heterotrophic 
denitrification was improved by shortening the HRT, similar to previous reports (Xu et al., 
2014) . At a shorter HRT of 1.7 d and a subsequently higher NLR of 0.61 ±  0.02 kg m-3 d-
1, both TN removal effici ency and NRR significantly increased (p < 0.01 for both) to 85.7 
± 0.7% and to 0.49 ±  0.04 kg m-3 d-1, respectively, which can be attributed to the 
enhancement of anammox and heterotrophic denitrification activities.   
When the HRT was further reduced to 1 .2 d (Phase III), significantly increased (p < 0.01 
for both) NH 4+-N (98.4 ± 11.8 mg L-1) and NO 2--N (92.8 ± 9.0 mg L-1) concentrations were 
observed in the effluent, with a simultaneously decreased NH 4+-N removal efficiency of 
75.6 ± 2.9% and NO 2--N remov al efficiency of 82.8 ± 1.6%, suggesting a diminished  
anammox activity (R 1 =1.47 ±  0.05). Further, a lower (p < 0.05) NO 3--N accumulation of 
48.2 ± 6.8 mg L-1was also observed due to enhanced heterotrophic denitrification, as 
indicated by the improved COD degradation efficiency of 28.7 ±  1.9% (Appendix B Figure 
B-4.2); the calculated percentage of total inorganic nitrogen removal increased to 13.2 ± 
0.9% by heterotrophic denitrification (Table 4.3).  73 
 The reported adverse effects of a short HRT that could affect nitrogen removal performance 
primarily referred to the substantial biomass wash -out or short -cut flow caused by the 
increased hydraulic pressure (Meng et al., 2018) . This could be easily ruled out in our study 
because heterotrophic denitrification or COD removal performance, occurring mainly in 
the flocs  (to be further discussed in section 3.2), was not compromised. As indi cated in the 
kinetics study (section 3.3), anammox activity was inhibited by the accumulation of NO 2--
N in each operation cycle (Appendix B Figure B -4.3), which was associated with the 
enhanced inorganic N loading at shorter HRT. Therefore, a deterioration  of TN removal 
efficiency (73.7 ± 0.7%) was still observed regardless of the higher heterotrophic 
denitrification, which is less efficient than anammox (Zhang et al., 2015b; Qiao et al., 2019) . 
Meanwhile, NRR still increased (p < 0.01) to 0.59 ±  0.01 kg m-3 d-1 with the higher NLR 
of 0.80 ±  0.01 kg m-3 d-1, which was similar to previously reported study (Malovanyy et 
al., 2015) . 
Phase IV was considered a restoration stage for the dete rioration of nitrogen removal 
performance in Phase III. Step feed mode was employed in Phase IV. Step feeding 
strategies have been regarded as an effective way to improve nitrogen removal performance 
in conventional biological nitrogen removal under higher  nitrogen loading conditions 
through reducing reactor interim substrate concentrations with more uniform substrate 
inputs  (Sahlstedt et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2018b) . In Phase IV (HRT of 1.2 d), the inorganic 
nitrogen loading was distributed equally as a temporal 50% -50% being introduced to each 
operation cycle. After approximately a 1 -month adaptation (days 276 -208), the removal 
efficiencies of NH 4+-N and NO 2--N increased significantly (p < 0.001 for both) to 90.9 ± 
1.8% and 92.1 ± 0.1%, respectively, with the effluent NH 4+-N and NO 2--N concentrations 74 
 reduced to 38.7 ± 6.9 mg L-1 and 45.2 ± 3.2 mg L-1, respectively, while the NO 3--N 
accumulation increased (p < 0.01) to 59.2 ± 2.9 mg L-1. The stoichiometric ratio R 1 
decreased significantly (p < 0.01) to 1.35 ±  0.06 while R 2 was relatively stabilized at 0.15 
± 0.01, probably because heterotrophic denitrification was not further improved  as evident 
from the comparable (p > 0.05) COD degradation efficiency (28.2 ± 7.8%) with Phase III. 
The calculated contribution to total inorganic nitrogen removal by the anammox process 
improved from 86.8 ± 1.8% to 93.6 ± 2.7% compared with that in phase III. Therefore, the 
restoration was achieved with the enhanced TN removal efficiency of 84.5 ± 0.1% and 
NRR of 0.71 ±  0.01 kg m-3 d-1 without compromising the treatment capacity (i.e., without 
increasing HRT).  
Due to the low concentration of biodegradable influent organic matters, the contribution of 
heterotrophic denitrification was limited under all conditions. Figure B -4.4 (Appendix B) 
showed the evolution of the nitrogen removal percentages by both processes. The average 
inorganic nitro gen removal percentage by the anammox route was 93.2 ± 3.8%, while 
heterotrophic denitrification contribution was 6.8 ± 2.1%. Results indicated that the 
anammox reaction was the main nitrogen removal route despite the co -existence of 
heterotrophic denitrif iers. The COD removal percentages calculated based on heterotrophic 
denitrification stoichiometry (Supplementary information) were similar to the measured 
values (Appendix B Figure B -4.2), indicating that most COD reduction contributed to the 
heterotrophic  NO 3-N and NO 2-N removal, which verified the calculations of inorganic 
nitrogen removal contribution by anammox and heterotrophic denitrifiers.  
4.3.2. Biomass and specific anammox activities (SAA)  75 
 The performance of anammox was determined by evaluating the biomass concentration 
and SAA (Jin et al., 2013) . Figure 4.2A shows that the total biofilm biomass concentration 
was higher than the floc biomass concentration, which is predictable in the anammox 
bacteria -dominant reactor where anammox bacteria were retained extremely long in the 
biofilm configuration. Meanwhile, the presence of the influent exogenous organic carbon 
prompted heterotrophic denitrifiers to dominate the flocs  in the bulk solution (Hubaux et 
al., 2015) .  
Both the total biofilm biomass and floc biomass in the reactor increased signifi cantly (p = 
0.022 for biofilm fraction and p = 0.001 for flocs  fraction) from 6.5 ± 0.2 g and 3.7 ± 0.1 g 
to 7.0 ± 0.2 g and to 4.5 ± 0.1 g, respectively from Phase I to Phase II due to the higher 
substrate ( i.e., nitrogen and organic carbon) loading, whic h was similar to the previous 
research (Liao et al., 2007; Nze et al., 2018) . 
However, further reduction of the HRT led to a decrease (p = 0.02) in floc biomass (3.5 ± 
0.2 g) in Phase III which was possibly caused by biomas s wash -out under high hydraulic 
pressure, while biofilm biomass continued increasing to 7.6 ± 0.2 g in Phase III (p = 0.03); 
this demonstrates the superior biomass retention ability of the biofilm configuration. With 
more uniform distribution of substrate (Phase IV), the biomass further increased to 4.7 ± 
0.1 g in flocs  and to 8.1 ± 0.2 g in biofilm (p = 0.001).  
The specific activities of anammox (SAA) in the four operation phases are shown in Figure 
4.2B, which were much higher than the reported value in t he one -stage nitritation/anammox 
reactors (Malovanyy et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018a) . The biofilm SAA increased 
significantly (p < 0.05) from 0.25 ± 0.09 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 to 0.41 ± 0.07 kg N kg-1 VSS 
d-1 when the HRT was shortened from 2.5 d (Phase I) to 1.7 d (Pha se II).  76 
  
 
Figure 4.2.  Biomass concentration (A) and specific anammox activity (SAA) (B) of flocs 
(red bars) and biofilm (gray bars) in the reactor under different operation phases.  
 
The biofilm SAA decreased (p < 0.05)  to 0.29 ± 0.02 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 when the HRT was 
further reduced to 1.2 d (Phase III), and was quickly recovered to 0.38 ± 0.05 kg N kg-1 
VSS d-1 in Phase IV, which were higher than the reported values (0.12 - 0.32 kg N kg-1 
VSS d-1) in various studies (Vázquez -Padín et al., 2009; Kotay et al., 2013) , especially 
when treating real lagoon supernatant . This change in biofilm SAA correlated well with 
the nitrogen removal performance as the anammox activity dominated in the nitrogen 
removal process. On the other hand, the floc SAA contributed to only 6 -13% of the total 
77 
 SAA in the reactor which was reduce d significantly (p < 0.05) from 0.035 ± 0.010 kg N 
kg-1 VSS d-1 at HRT of 2.5 d (Phase I) to 0.025 ± 0.000~0.028 ± 0.004 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 
at the shorter HRTs of 1.2 -1.7 d (Phase II -IV).  
As discussed above, different from the biofilm only configuration, w here heterotrophs 
exclusively grow in the outer layer of the biofilms, a better segregation of microbial species 
and activity can be provided in the IFAS configuration where the majority of the 
heterotrophic activities were shifted to the bulk ( i.e., flocs ), whereas the anammox activity 
dominated the biofilm (Hubaux et al., 2015) . The elevated nitrogen and organic loading 
with the shorter HRT facilitated the shift in spatial partitioning of anammox bacteria and 
heterotrophic denitrifiers, and subsequently led to a lower SAA in the flocs  fracti on. This 
observation was also directly reflected by our microbial analysis (Figure 4.4). From a 
positive side, the anammox bacteria (in a small amount) which were detached from the 
biofilm were entrapped in the flocs  and therefore were “protected” to the i nhibitors, 
resulting in no further decrease of SAA in the flocs  under the nitrite inhibition in Phase III.  
4.3.3. Degradation kinetics studies and inhibition mechanism analysis  
The change of NH 4+-N oxidation, NO 2--N consumption, and NO 3--N accumulation in 
typical SBR cycles under each operation conditions are shown in Figure 4.3 and the 
calculated change rates of each nitrogen species were summarized in Figure B -4.3 
(Appendix B). Under a higher NLR ( i.e., shorter HRT) condition in Phase II, NH 4+-N 
oxidation, NO 2--N consumption, and NO 3--N accumulation rates enhanced due to the 
improved anammox activity. These rates then decreased simultaneously in Phase III 
because of the nitrite inhibition. The further increased NLR in Phase III exceeded the  
anammox capacity in the reactor, leading to the NO 2--N accumulation and its resultant 78 
 inhibition of the anammox bacteria. Therefore, the interim NO 2--N concentration in the 
operation cycle of Phase III (141.2 -219.2 g L-1) was much higher than that in other phases 
(i.e., 4-132.5 g L-1 in Phase I, 25 -145 g L-1 in Phase II and 40 -129 g L-1 in Phase IV, as 
shown in Figure 4.3), which could reflect the inhibition on anammox activity in this phase. 
As reported previously, nitrite inhibition is a rate limitin g criterion for many anammox 
reactor con figurations. High concentration of nitrite can lead to irreversible inhibition ( i.e., 
toxicity) of the anammox bacteria by causing imbalance in cell mass transport and proton 
gradient (Li et al., 2017) , or reversible inhibition on c ertain metabolic activities (Qiao et 
al., 2017) . In the meantime, the concentration of FNA which was recognized as the actual 
inhibitor of anammox under high nitrite concentration ( Ferná ndez et al. (2012) ), was also 
determined in our study. The FNA concentrations were 1.7 ± 0.8 µg L-1 in Phase I, 2.1 ± 
1.3 µg L-1 in Phase II and 2.8 ± 1.2 µg L-1 in Phase IV, which was below the commonly 
reported FNA inhibition concentration (5.9 - 19.8 µg L-1) for anammox bacteria (Oshiki et 
al., 2011) . However in Phase III, FNA concentration increased to 18.9 ± 8.9 µg L-1. 
Therefore, both of the concentrations of FNA and NO 2--N indicate the inhibition of 
anammox activity occurring in Phase III. Both inhibition mechanisms result in mitigation 
or even cessation of the reaction as reflected by the lowest nitrogen conversion kinetics in 
Phase III in our study. Further, the highest NH 4+-N oxidation rate  with step feeding in Phase 
IV may suggest the reversible nitrite inhibition is the major inhibitory mechanism, as step 
feeding greatly reduced (p < 0.05) the interim NO 2--N concentration in the operation cycle 
of Phase IV.  
4.3.4. Quantification of functional genes by qPCR  79 
 Figure 4.4 shows the gene copy numbers of anammox and heterotrophic denitrifiers in both 
biofilm and flocs, based on functional gene analysis. AMX nirS encoding gene have been 
widely applied for targeting genus of Candidatus Brocadia , Candidatus Jettenia , 
Candidatus Kuenenia  and Candidatus Anammoxoglobus (Li et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2019) . 
Among those four genus, Candidatus Kuenenia  and Candidatu s Brocadia  are the most 
commonly found organisms in enrichments from WWTPs (Jetten et al., 2009) . Similarly, 
nosZ  and narG  were two most widely applied primer sets for targeting heterotrophic 
denitrifiers (Henry et al., 2006; Segawa et al., 2014) . Overall, the abundance of AMX nirS 
gene for anammox bacteria in biofilm was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than that in flocs  
(i.e., > 90% AMX nirS gene detected in the biofilm biomass), suggesting a more important 
role of the biofilm configuration in ammonium removal, which agrees with the SAA results 
(Figure 4.2B).  
The decrease in HRT from 2.5 d (Phase I) to 1.7 d (Phase II) led to a significant increase 
in the AMX nirS gene copy number from 4.1×106 ± 4.6×105 and 3.7×107 ± 2.1×106 copies 
mg-1 VSS biomass to 5.6×106 ± 6.2×105 and 6.9×107 ± 5.2×106 copies mg-1 VSS biomass 
in flocs  and in the biofilm respectively, displaying a respective increase of 37.9% and 88.6% 
of AMX nirS gene copy numbers in flocs  and biofilm.  
Generally, higher nitrogen loading accompanied with shorter HRT in Phase II could 
encourage the growth of anammox bacte ria in both flocs  and biofilm. In addition, when 
biofilm reached a certain thickness, biomass could be detached from biocarriers and further 
increase the AMX nirS gene abundance in the bulk flocs  (Qiao et al., 2019) .

sequencing batch reactor cycles of Phase I (black dots), Phase II (red dots), Phase III 
(grey dots) and Phase IV (blue dots).  Error bar represent duplicate measurements.  
 
In contrast, the lower increase percentage of anammox bacteria in flocs  may result in a less 
susceptible anammox bacteria community to the change of HRT because of the floc 
structure. Under the nitrite inhibition condition (Phase III), the AMX nirS gene co py 
numbers decreased by 38.0% (from 5.6×106 ± 6.2×105 to 3.5×106 ± 5.9×105 copies mg-1 
VSS biomass) and 29.1% (from 6.9×107 ± 5.2×106 to 4.9×107 ± 5.2×106 copies mg-1 VSS 
biomass) in flocs  and biofilm respectively, which correspond to SAA results and nitro gen 
removal performance as well. After switching the feeding mode to step feeding in Phase 
IV, our results show that the AMX nirS gene copy numbers increased by 24.6% (from 
4.9×107 ± 5.2×106 to 6.1×107 ± 5.2×106 copies mg-1 VSS biomass) in biofilm and decreased 
slightly (from 3.5×106 ± 5.9×105 to 3.1×106 ± 6.3×105 copies mg-1 VSS biomass) in flocs. 
The recovery in anammox bacteria population abundance was expected after the nitrite 
inhibition was mitigated in Phase IV. From our previous microbial results, anammox 
bacteria were mostly affiliated with the genus Candidatus Brocadia, which dominated the 
bacterial biofilm community (Yang et al., 2019) . 
 82

denitrifiers in biofilm and flocs , respectively in different operation phases (Phase I (gray 
bars), Phase II (red bars), Phase III (blue bars) and Phase IV (pink bars)).  
 
Meanwhile, the de nitrifier gene (primarily targeted nosZ  and narG ) abundance in flocs  was 
significantly higher than that in biofilm (p < 0.01). Denitrifiers can be more easily detached 
from the biocarrier as they grow mostly in the outer layer of biofilm. Therefore, a rela tive 
stable abundance was observed for the denitrifiers in the biofilm (1.4×107 ± 1.1×106 to 
2.1×107± 1.8×106 copies mg-1 VSS biomass for nosZ  and 1.1×107 ± 1.0×106 to 1.7×107 ± 
1.0 ×106 copies mg-1 VSS biomass for narG  respectively). In the flocs  where denitrifers 
dominated (> 70% of total denitrifier genes, for both nosZ  and narG ), the abundance of the 
denitrifier genes nosZ  and narG  increased significantly (p < 0.05) from 4.7×107 ± 6.1×106 
to 7.3×107 ± 5.8 ×106 copies  mg-1 VSS biomass and from 3.3×107 ± 4.1×106 to 6.0×107 ± 
4.3 ×106 copies mg-1 VSS biomass,  respectively, as the HRT decreased from Phase I to 
Phase III, while a further increase in denitrifier genes was not observed with the step 
feeding operation in Phas e IV. This is plausible and was similar to the previous 
83 
 observations which suggests the lower HRT consistently leading to a higher population of 
heterotrophic bacteria (Xu et al., 2014) . Moreover, the limited increase in the abundance 
of narG  in Phase III was probably due to the biomass washout at the shorter HRT which 
correlated well with floc biomass change in Figure 4.2A. The amoA gene copy numbers 
(representing the AOB bacteria abundance) were about five log units lower than the 
anammox ba cteria copy numbers, indicating their low abundance in the reactor.  
4.4. Conclusion  
For the first time, the impacts of operating strategies on the IFAS -SBR anammox reactor 
treating ammonium rich digestate lagoon supernatants was demonstrated. Anammox 
activ ity was slightly improved by shortening HRT from 2.5 d to 1.7 d which may reach the 
maximum anammox capacity of the reactor. The anammox activity was inhibited with the 
further reduced HRT of 1.2 d due to the interim accumulation of nitrite in the reactor.  The 
strategy of applying step feed at HRT of 1.2 d mitigated the nitrite accumulation and 
restored the anammox activity.  Heterotrophic denitrification co -existed with anammox in 
the reactor for the nitrogen removal activity, however, with minor contributi on and less 
affected by nitrite accumulation. Our study concluded that optimization of IFAS anammox 
reactor can be achieved by shortening HRT, but the increased risk of nitrite inhibition of 
anammox activity should be considered with the increased nitrogen  load. Changing the 
feeding strategy (i.e., applying step -feeding) can effectively mitigate nitrite inhibition. The 
co-existence of heterotrophic denitrifies contributed to less than 10% of the nitrogen 
removal under all conditions, without affecting the a nammox activity in the IFAS 
configuration.  84 
 It should be noted that our study focused on applying the step feeding strategy to mitigate 
the nitrite inhibition on the anammox activity. However, the 2nd stage of anammox 
bioreactor may be optimized through further operation condition optimization (e.g. through 
reducing cycle duration time , changing VEX percentages ) to reduce the potential FNA 
inhibition of the reactor , which was not studied in the present paper but may be of interest 
of further studi es.

 CHAPTER 5 IMPORTANCE OF CONTROLLING PHOSPHATE 
CONCENTRATION IN NITRITATION -ANAMMOX REACTOR OPERATION3 
5.1. Introduction  
Anaerobic digester sludge liquor in municipal sewage treatment plants contains high 
concentrations of ammonia nitrogen (i.e., 800 –1200 mg/L NH 4+-N) and phosphorus (i.e., 
180–250 mg PO 43--P/L), and has a low biodegradable chemical oxygen demand (COD)  
(i.e., < 280 mg/L in BOD)  (Wang et al., 2014 ; Shao et al., 2018 ). Conventional 
nitrification/denitrification treatment of sludge liquor is energy intensive due to the 
extensive aeration required for high ammonia removal. Additional organic carbon is 
requi red for complete denitrification, which imposes a further cost increase. On the other 
hand, the application of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), utilizing bacteria 
capable of oxidizing NH 4+ with NO 2- as the electron acceptor at mesophilic temperature s 
(30–40 C) is a  cost effective option  to treat high ammonia (NH 4+) strength  stream 
(Rikmann et al., 2018 ; Zekker et al., 2018 ). Nitritation -anammox, which depends on 
ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB, e.g., nitrosomonas ) to partially oxidize NH 4+ to NO 2-, 
and anammox bacteria (e.g., Candidatus Brocadia ) to convert the remaining NH 4+ and the 
produced NO 2- to N 2 gas, has bec ome an attractive process for enhanced nitrogen removal 
from ammonia rich wastewater (Rikmann et al., 2018 ; Zekker et al., 2018 ). 
Full scale application of nitritation -anammox reactors for ammonia -rich sludge supernatant 
treatment is increasing, but still facing the challenges such as unexplained anammox 
 
3 A version of this chapter has been published: Yang, S., Xu, S., Florentino, A. P., 
Mohammed, A., Ashbolt, N. J., & Liu, Y. (2019). Importance of controlling phosphate

 instabilities during the long -term operation (Gilbert et al., 2014 ; Tenno et al., 2018a ; Tenno 
et al., 2018b ). Anammox bacteria are difficult to cultivate because of their low g rowth rate, 
low cell yield (0.11 g volatile suspended solids (VSS)/gNH 4+-N), and high sensitivity to 
environmental conditions (Gilbert et al., 2014 ). Various common wastewater constituents 
have been reported to influence nitrita tion-anammox stability.  In particular, a high free 
ammonium concentration (> 25 mg NH 3-N/L) has been shown to inhibit anammox under 
mesophilic conditions  (Carvajal -Arroyo et al., 2013 ). Salinity (dissolved solids 
concentration  > 20 g/L), heavy metals, NO 2− (> 120 mg N/L), O 2 (DO > 2.5 mg/L), low 
temperature (< 25 oC) and H 2S (> 64 mg H 2S-S/L) also inhibit anammox activities, 
especially over long -term wastewater treatment (Carvajal -Arroyo et al., 2013 ). A high 
concentration of phosphate may also impact anammox activities, although only limited 
reports a re available.  Van de Graaf et al. (1996 ) first reported a 100% inhibition on the 
growth of anammox bacteria in the suspended culture exposed to 160 mg PO 43--P/L 
phosphate in batch experiments. Pynaert et al. (2003 ) observed an 80% inhibition  of 
anammox bacteria culti vated using a rotating biological contactor (dominated by Ca. 
Kuenenia stuttgartiensis ) when the phosphate concentration was above 100 mg PO 43--P/L. 
More recently, Carvajal -Arroyo et al. (2013 ) found that the specific anammox activity 
(SAA) of a Ca. Brocadia  dominant anammox culture  was reduced by 60%, when 
phosphate concentrations were elevated from 170 to 1000 mg PO 43--P/L. All the reported 
studies were performed in the anammox only system with synthetic wastewater feeding. 
The impact of a high phosphate c oncentration on the performance and stability of microbes 
in continuously operating nitritation -anammox bioreactors treating real ammonium rich 
wastewater (e.g., digester thickening lagoon supernatant) has not been reported.   95 
 Considering the high phosphoro us concentration in anaerobic sludge digester sludge liquor 
(235 ± 15.4 mg PO 43--P/L or 8.0 ± 0.5 mM), it is important to explore the impact of 
phosphorous on the activity of anammox bacteria in continuous operating bioreactors for 
nitrogen reduction. If p hosphorous inhibition exists, the phosphorous concentration in 
digester sludge liquor can be reduced by first precipitating phosphorous as struvite 
(NH 4MgPO 4·6H 2O, a spin -off product that can be applied as a slow release fertilizer). In 
full-scale side -stream treatment plants, phosphorus recovery processes, e.g., Ostara® 
processes, are applied after nitritation -anammox treatment with the goal of preserving 
sufficient phosphorous for microbial growth in bioreactors (Sharp et al., 2013 ).   
Our current study was undertaken to determine and compare the treatment performance, 
and dynamic of microbial community and anammox activities in, a nitritation -anammox 
reactor treating digester sludge thickening lagoon supernatants before (pre -Ostara®) and 
after (post -Ostara®) struvite recovery (phosphorous reduction). A laboratory integrated 
fixed -film activated sludge sequencing batch reactor (IFAS -SBR) that carries out one stage 
nitritation -anammox was run for 575 days to evaluate phosphate impacts.  The present study 
provides much needed information on the impact of phosphorous concentration on 
nitritation -anammox reactor performance.  
5.2. Methods and materials  
5.2.1 Reactor feed  
Digested sludge liquor thickening lagoon supernatant was collected from a biosolids 
digester sludge thickening lagoon in the City of Edmonton once a month. To minimize 
microbial activity, the lagoon supernatant was stored at 4 C prior to use. An Ostara® 
facility in Edmonton recovers phosphorus from the lagoon supernatant. Lagoon 96 
 supernatant before and after Ostara® treatment was collected and fed into a continuous 
operating reactor sequentially. 50% pre -Ostara® and post -Ostara® feed water was prepared 
by diluting raw pre -Ostara® and raw post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant with deionized (DI) 
water in 1:1 volume ratio, respectively.  
5.2.2 Reactor operation  
The lab -scale integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) reactor with a working volume 
of 6 L was run in a sequencing batch mode. The reactor was seeded with colonized 
AnoxKaldnes K5 biofilm carriers (800 m2/m3 protected surface area) with a 38% volume 
fill ratio, kindly provided by Veolia.   
The IFAS -SBR reactor was operated following four operation phase s (Table 5.2) for a total 
of 575 days. In the first two phases, the reactor was fed with 50% and 100% pre -Ostara® 
lagoon supernatant, respectively; in the last two phases, the reactor was fed with 50% and 
100% post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant, respectively.  As a result, the respective influent 
PO 43--P concentration was 120 mg/L, 235 mg/L, 15 mg/L and 32 mg/L from Phase I to 
Phase IV, either through the dilution of lagoon supernatant (to achieve 50% of the lagoon 
supernatant) or applying Ostara® pretreatment.  
The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of the IFAS reactor was maintained at 2.4 days. The 
IFAS reactor was operated following a sequencing batch model; each sequencing batch 
reactor (SBR) cycle lasted for 12 hours, which included a 5 min feeding, a 10 hour r eaction, 
a 110 min settling, and a 5 min effluent discharge. The reaction phase consisted of five 
alternating aeration (80 -105 min) and non -aeration (15 -40 min) periods (with a total of 2 
hours in each period). 0.16 –0.24 mg/L of dissolved oxygen was mainta ined in the aeration 
periods. The duration of aeration and non -aeration periods was based on the anammox 97 
 activity. At a lower anammox activity, a longer non -aeration period was provided to 
prevent rapid nitrite accumulation produced by AOB bacteria during the aeration period. 
The sludge retention time (SRT) of the suspension was maintained at 24 ± 3.2 days, 
considering the mixed liquor suspended solids, and the influent and effluent suspended 
solid concentrations, while the SRT of attached growth biomass wa s considered as “infinite” 
(Veuillet et al., 2014 ). Reactor pH of 7.2 -7.8 was maintained naturally as a result from the 
diverse metabolic activities of microbi al community.  
The reactor feed volume exchange ratio (i.e., the ratio of feed volume added to the reactor 
at the beginning of each cycle to the reactor working volume) was 21%. A thermostatic 
water jacket was used to keep the temperature of the liquid at 31 ± 2 °C. A mechanical 
stirrer was used to keep the reactor completely mixed during reaction period.  
5.2.3 Sample collection and analytical methods  
Reactor influent and effluent were sampled daily or every two days during the operation. 
Water quality inc luding the concentrations of COD, NH 4+-N, NO 3--N, and NO 2--N and 
PO 43--P were measured with Hach kits (methods 8000, 10205, 10206, 10207 and 10209, 
respectively, Loveland, Colorado).  
Water quality (NH 4+-N, NO 3--N, and NO 2--N) tests were also performed during SBR cycles 
with proper intervals to determine the nitrogen species transformation and to evaluate the 
nitrogen reduction kinetics in the reactor. After collection, water samples were filtrated 
with 0.45 μm filters and m easured within 2 h.  
5.2.4 Biomass analysis  
Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids 
(MLVSS) were measured every week according to Standard Methods (APHA, 2011).  98

The biofilm biomass was determined using methods reported previously (Shao et al., 2018 ).  
The specific anammox activity (SAA) of biomass under steady state conditions was 
determined with the method described in Jin et al. (2013 ). The serum bottles were de -
oxygenized by purging N 2 gas for 25 min, and were immediately sealed with butyl rubber 
before being pla ced in a thermostatic shaker operated at 31 ± 1 °C and 180 rpm. Biomass 
concentration and pH were measured at the end of each test. SAA was calculated as the 
maximum substrate consumption rate divided by VSS.  99 
 5.2.5 Short -term batch experiments to detect p hosphate impacts  
Batch experiments were conducted using serum bottles to determine the short -term (4 -8 
hours) impact of phosphate stress on bacterial activities. Biofilm and flocs  samples 
obtained from the continuous operating reactor (at a biofilm to sludge volume ratio of 40 
biocarriers: 280 mL sludge) on days 80, 120, and 150 were inoculated in batch reactors to 
treat pre -Ostara® and post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant containing va rious phosphorous 
concentrations.   
Two trials were performed (Appendix A Table A -3). In Trial 1, 12%, 25%, 50%, and 100% 
pre-Ostara® lagoon supernatant solutions were used to provide phosphate for the batch tests, 
and the targeted final phosphate concentra tions were 30, 60, 120, and 240 mg PO 43--P/L, 
respectively. Two additional higher phosphate concentrations were tested by directly 
adding inorganic NaH 2PO 4 into 100% pre -Ostara® supernatant samples to reach 350 and 
450 mg PO 43--P/L. In Trial 2, synthetic N aH2PO 4 was directly added into the post -Ostara® 
lagoon supernatant solutions (~ 30 mg PO 43--P/L) to obtain targeted phosphate 
concentrations similar to Trial 1 (30, 60, 120, 240, 350, and 450 mg PO 43--P/L). The 
difference between the first two trials is th at Trial 1 examines the impacts of all lagoon 
supernatant pollutant concentrations on the specific anammox activity (SAA), in addition 
to the phosphate concentrations examined in Trial 2.  With such design, Trial 2 evaluates 
if an elevated phosphate concen tration in the lagoon supernatant could impact the 
anammox reaction; and the comparison of Trials 1 and 2 examines whether phosphate is 
the main inhibiting factor in lagoon supernatant.  100 
 For both trials, biofilm and flocs  were separated to evaluate SAA var iations under different 
phosphate concentrations. Table A -3 (Appendix A) shows the detailed experimental 
conditions for the short -term phosphate impact on the activity of anammox bacteria.  
5.2.6 q -PCR analysis and MiSeq sequencing  
The biomass samples of b iofilm and sludge were collected during the steady -state 
conditions of four phases for both denitrification and anammox bacteria. DNA of sludge 
and biofilm biomass was extracted with MO BIO PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kits (MoBio 
Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, California). qPCR kits were purchased from Bio -Rad 
Laboratories, Mississauga, Ontario. Table A -1 (Appendix A) shows the detailed 
information of qPCR primers and target genes.  
The extracted DNA samples were analyzed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing on an Illumi ne 
MiSeq platform at the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX, USA) to investigate 
bacteria community diversity and composition. The V3 -V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes 
were amplified using primer set 357wF (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 785R 
(GACTACHVGGGTATC TAATCC) (Loh et al., 2018 ). Sequencing data processing and 
taxonomic classification were completed using QIIME pipelines  with references in the 
Silva database (Caporaso et al., 2011 ).

5.3. Results and discussion  
5.3.1 Lagoon supernatant characteristics  101 
 The water chemistry of digester sludge thickening lagoon supernatant before and after 
Ostara® treatment is shown in Table 5.1. In the pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant,  the COD 
concentration was 644 ± 14.42 mg/L with the readily biodegradable COD (rbCOD) 
concentration of 205 ± 25 mg/L, the ammonium nitrogen concent ration was 891.9 ± 79 
mg/L, and the phosphate concentration was 235 ± 15.4 mg PO 43--P/L. The post -Ostara® 
stream had relatively lower COD values of 568 ± 54 mg/L with the rbCOD concentration 
of 189 ± 28 mg/L, a significantly lower phosphate concentration ( 32 ± 5.4 mg PO 43--P/L), 
and a comparable ammonia concentration (835 ± 35 mg N/L) (P < 0.01) compared to the 
pre-Ostara® lagoon supernatant . Free ammonia concentration was low (< 12.8 mg/L) in the 
reactor (Table 5.1), as the pH in the reactor was in the ran ge of 7.2 -7.8, which was below 
the commonly reported free ammonia inhibition concentration (25 -157 mg NH 3-N/L) (Jin 
et al., 2012 ) for both NOB and anammox bacteria.  FNA (free nitrous acid) concentrations 
were negligible  in the reactor, which were 0.0015 ± 0.0006 mg NO 2--N /L and 0.0010 ± 
0.0006 mg NO 2--N/L in the pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant and post -Ostara® lagoon 
supernatant, respectively.  
5.3.2 Impacts of Ostara® pretreatment on nitritation -anammox reactor performance  
The IFAS bioreactor was operated in a sequencing  batch mode for 575 days.  
As shown in Figure 5.1, when the reactor feed was switched from 50% pre -Ostara® lagoon 
supernatant (400 ± 32 mg NH 4+-N/L, 120 ± 12 mg PO 43--P/L) to 100% pre -Ostara® lagoon 
supernatant (891 ± 79 mg NH 4+-N/L, 235 ± 15.4 mg PO 43--P/L), the NH 4+-N removal 
percentage was reduced from 88.2 ± 2.5% to 55% ± 9.8%. Previous studies demonstrated 
that under certain inhibition conditions, microorganisms may adapt to the stress co ndition 
over time (Nautiyal et al., 2000 ; Romano et al., 2015 ). However, this adaption was not 102 
 observed in our study, and instead we observed continuous deterioration of the reactor 
performance over the 94 days of operation in Phase II. A signi ficant reduction in N removal 
efficiency  was also accompanied by a high NO 2− accumulation (120 -189 mg NO 2−-N/L), 
indicating an anammox activity inhibition when the raw pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant 
was directly used as reactor feed.

reactor (A) and relative specific AOB and anammox activity of biofilm and flocs (B) 
during four different phases: 50% Pre -Ostara® supernatant; 100% Pre -Ostara® 
supernatant; 50% Post -Ostara® supernatant and 100% Post -Ostara® supernatant.  
103 
  
Treatment of 50% post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant (420 ± 35 mg NH 4+-N/L, 16 ± 5.4 mg 
PO 43--P/L) achieved an NH 4+-N removal percentage  of 89.6 ± 3.2%. An increase of post -
Ostara® lagoon supernatant fraction to 100% did not impact the NH 4+-N reduction 
percentage, and led to an NH 4+-N removal of 88.2 ± 3.6% (P < 0.01). Figure 5.1A shows 
that no significant NO 2- accumulation was observed when post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant 
was utilized as reactor feed. As shown in Appendix B Figure B -5.1, although it took 117 
days (from day 403 to day 520) for the bioreactor to stabilize when the reactor feed was 
switched from 5 0% to 100% post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant (corresponding to a NH 4+-N 
loading rate change of 0.17 to 0.34 kg N (m3·d)), the reactor performance was stable once 
sufficient biomass was established (from day 520 and from day 575, as discussed below). 
The volu metric nitrogen removal rates (VNRR), biomass specific nitrogen removal rates 
(BNRR) and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) efficiencies calculated for each operation phase 
are shown in Table 5.2. The highest VNRR, BNRR and TIN achieved were 0.30 ± 0.01 kg 
N/(m3·d), 0.13 ± 0.01 g N/(g VSS·d), and 80.2 ± 2.8%, respectively, under 100% post -
Ostara® feed condition. The VNRR in the reactor with 100%  post -Ostara lagoon 
supernatant feed was higher than the reported highest value of 0.28 kg N/(m3·d) treating 
real ana erobic digester supernatant (Vázquez -Padín et al., 2009 ). Meanwhile, the stationary 
phase or stable operation phase in the reactor operation can be defined as the phase where 
organics and nutrient removal efficiency became stable wh ich happened because the 
mature microbial community was well developed or acclimated to the operation conditions. 
The stable operation time in the experimental study can be expected to be at least 2 -3 times 
of the start -up period, which was achieved in our  study.  104

5.3.3. Anammox bacteria and AOB activities during reactor operation  
The specific activities of AOB and anammox bacteria measured in the four operation 
phases are shown in Figure 5.1B. SAA were 0.24 ± 0.012 g N/(g VSS·d), 0.14 ± 0.014 g 
N/(g VSS·d), 0.27 ± 0.016 g N/(g VSS·d) and 0.31 ± 0.014 g N/(g VSS·d) from Ph ase I to 
Phase IV, respectively; the lowest SAA value occurred when the reactor was fed 100% 
pre-Ostara® lagoon supernatant, which corresponds to a low ammonia reduction under such 
feeding condition in the nitritation -anammox reactor. AOB activities were stable during all 
four phases, indicating that the phosphate concentrations did not have a significant impact 
on AOB bacteria activities (P > 0.05). This result helps to explain the NO 2--N accumulation 
observed under 100% pre -Ostara® lagoon  supernatant  feeding conditions.  105 
 It was observed that the phosphate tolerance ability of anammox biomass was dependent 
on aggregation type. Figure 5.1B shows that the specific anammox activity (SAA) in 
biofilm was significantly (P < 0.01) higher than the SAA in flocs  under all treatment 
conditions. When reactor operation was switched from 50% to 100% pre -Ostara® lagoon 
supernatant, the SAA in suspended growth biomass and the SAA in biofilm decreased by 
78% and 28%, respectively, indicating that flocs  was less resistant than biofilm to the 
reactor feed change. The SAA in both biofilm and flocs  increased after switching the 
reactor feed from pre -Ostara® to post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant. It was also noted that 
the activity of AOB bacteria was higher in the flocs  than in the biofilm. It has b een reported 
that faster growing microorganisms (i.e., the AOB in our study) prefer to inhabit the 
suspended growth phase, and slower growing microorganisms (i.e., the anammox bacteria 
in our study) proliferate in the attached growth phase (Veuillet et al., 2014 ). The enhanced 
segregation of anammox bacteria and AOB in IFAS system can help mitigate the substrate 
diffusion limitation which was observed in biofilm alone system (Laureni et al., 2019 ).  
5.3.4 Degradation kinetics  
Figure B -5.3 (Appendix B) shows the nitrogen c oncentration changes in typical SBR cycles 
under each operation condition. Based on the results shown in Figure B -5.3, ammonium 
consumption and nitrite accumulation rates in SBR cycles were calculated; the process 
efficiencies and nitrogen removal rates ar e shown in Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2 shows that 
ammonium can be consumed in both aeration and non -aeration phases under all conditions. 
Under the aeration phase, ammonium was oxidized and nitrite was produced. The 
consumption of ammonium can be attributed to nitritation (production of NO 2-), 
nitrification (production of NO 3-) and anammox reactions (consumption of NH 4+ and NO 2-, 106 
 and production of NO 3-). In the non -aeration (anoxic) stage, concentrations of both NO 2- 
and NH 4+ decreased due to anammox and/or deni trification activities. As shown in Figure 
5.2A, ammonium consumption rates in aeration and non -aeration phases were similar for 
all feeding conditions except for the 100% pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant feeding 
condition where the NH 4+-N consumption rate i n the aeration phase was significantly (P < 
0.01) higher than that in the non -aeration phase. Again, the nitrite accumulation rate in the 
aeration phase was low for all conditions, except for the 100% pre -Ostara® lagoon 
supernatant feeding condition; the high nitrite accumulation rate (0.19 ± 0.01 mg/L/min) 
observed under 100% pre -Ostara® feeding condition can be attributed to the low anammox 
activities in the aeration phase. Ammonium reduction rates in both aerat ion and non -
aeration periods reached the highest levels under the 100% post -Ostara lagoon supernatant 
feeding condition.  
Nitrate production occurred in both aeration and non -aeration periods. Both NO 2- oxidation 
and anammox can produce NO 3-, while heterotr ophic denitrification reduces nitrate 
concentrations. Figure 5.2B shows a COD reduction of 28% -32% (12 -15% in the aeration 
phase and 14 -17% in the non -aeration phase), indicating that denitrification occurred. 
However, due to a low biodegradable COD in the  lagoon supernatant (< 280 mg/L), 
heterotrophic denitrification was limited (< 36.8 mg N/L, based on a theoretical COD:N 
ratio of 7.6) (Sobieszuk and Szewczyk, 2006 ), making anammox the major route of 
observed nitrogen reduction. Our results showed that the ratio of NO 2--N consumption to 
NH 4+-N consumption in anammox process was not significantly different before (1.38 ± 
0.04) and after (1.36 ± 0.03) switching the feed, and indicated the anammox pathway was 107 
 the major route in the reactor under both conditions  as compared to the theoretical ratio in 
anammox s toichiometry  (i.e., 1 NH 4+ requires 1.32 NO 2−) (Gilbert et al., 2014 ). 
 
 
Figure 5.2.  Ammonium reduction and nitrite accumulation rates (mg/L/min) in the 
bioreactor under four operation phases (A), and COD removal percentage and nitrate 
produced/ammonium consumed during each operation cycle (B).  
 
Meanwhile, according to the anammox stoichi ometry, 11% of nitrogen as substrate was 
converted to NO 3--N. Thus, a value of NO 3--N /NH 4+-N (the fraction of NH 4+-N converted 
108 
 to NO 3--N) greater than 11% suggests that NO 3--N was produced by nitrite oxidizing 
bacteria (NOB) oxidation process. A value of NO 3--N /NH 4+-N smaller than 11% suggests 
that NO 3--N was generated by anammox and/or that nitrification was reduced by 
heterotrophic denitrification.  Our calculations showed that in both aeration and non -
aeration phases, NO 3--N /NH 4+-N ratios were below 11%, indicating that nitrite oxidation 
was not significant in our experiments; and that denitrification contributed to nitrogen 
reduction in the reactor.   
It should be noted that the non -aeration phase was sli ghtly adjusted based on reactor 
performance, as a longer non -aeration phase is needed when anammox activity is low and 
nitrite accumulation is observed. In the present study, the non -aeration period was 
maintained at 20 min and 40 min in 50% and 100% pre -Ostara® conditions, respectively, 
and 15 min in 50% and 100% post -Ostara conditions. Only a short non -aeration phase was 
required in post -Ostara® conditions  due to the high anammox activities in these phases (as 
shown in Appendix B Figure B -5.3). 
5.3.5 Impact of phosphate concentration on specific anammox activity (SAA)  
As shown in Figure 5.3, under both Trial 1 (direct dilution of pre -Ostara® lagoon 
supernatant) and Trial 2 (P addition to post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant) conditions, SAA 
declined when th e phosphate concentration was greater than 120 mg PO 43--P/L. In 
particular, when the phosphate concentration increased from 30 mg PO 43--P/L (100% post -
Ostara® feed) to 240 mg PO 43--P/L (100% pre -Ostara® feed), the SAA declined from 0.30 
to 0.17 kg N/(kg VS S·d). SAA inhibition in Trial 1 (when pre -Ostara® feed received 
different water volumes in order to estimate phosphate concentrations based on dilution) 
and SAA inhibition in Trial 2 (post -Ostara® feed with direct addition of NaH 2PO 4) were 109 
 not statisticall y different in terms of the relative reduction in SAA (P = 0.84). A comparison 
of the two trials illustrated that phosphate inhibition was the major factor in the observed 
anammox activity reduction when pre -Ostara® supernatant was used as reactor feed 
regardless of the P source.  
 
Figure 5.3.  Impact of phosphate concentrations (30 -450 mg PO 4-P/L) on specific 
anammox biomass activities (kg N/(kg VSS·d)). Trial 1 examines the impact of 
phosphate concentrations by diluting pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant with deionized 
water. Trial 2 evaluates the impact of phosphate concentrations by adding NaH 2PO 4 
directly to post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant.  
 
Further, SAA  in biofilm was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than SAA in flocs  under all P 
concentration conditions, indicating the significance of biofilms in anammox based 
nitrogen reduction. Both biofilms and flocs  were significantly  inhibited when the 
concentrations of phosphate were above 120 mg PO 43--P/L, and biofilms showed greater 
tolerance  than flocs  toward the observed phosphorous inhibition (P < 0.01).  
5.3.6 Microbial community analysis  
110 
 The microbial community variation under different reactor feeding conditions is shown in 
Figure 5.4. Figure 5.4A indicates a high prevalence of Bacteroidetes , Proteobacteria , 
Chlorobi , and Chloroflexi , which are commonly reported to be prevalent heterotrophic 
phyla in anammox bioreactors. (Lawson et al., 2017 ) Ignavibacteriae , previously 
characterized as cellulolytic bacteria (Podosokorskaya et al., 2013 ), were abundant in both 
biofilm and flocs . 
The relative abundance of Planctomycetes  (the Planctomycetes  phylum covers all five 
anammox genera discovered to date) (Pereira et al., 2017 ) was much higher in biofilm than 
in flocs under all conditions (Figure 5.4A). This observation is supported by results shown 
in Figure 5.3, where the specific anammox activity is much higher in biofilm than in flocs. 
Our results underline the importance of  biofilms in the control of anammox activities in 
the reactor. As shown in Figure 5.4, when reactor feed was switched from 50% pre -Ostara® 
to 100% pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant, a decrease in the relative abundance of 
Planctomycetes  from 8.0% to 5.5% in b iofilms was observed. The relative abundance of 
Planctomycetes  increased to 8.4% in the 50% post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant  feeding 
condition, and to 17.5% in 100% post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant  feeding.  
Within the phylum Planctomycetes , the dominant anam mox bacterial genus was 
Candidatus Brocadia . The abundance of Ca. Brocadia  decreased from 3.6% to 2.5% in 
biofilm, and from 3.1% to 0.1% in flocs, when the reactor feed changed from 50% pre -
Ostara® supernatant to 100% pre -Ostara® supernatant.  111 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5.4.  Relative read abundance (%) of 16S V4 rRNA gene sequences out of 10 000 
reads per sample. Abundance of the major groups (>0.1% in any sample) in the biofilm 
and flocs  at the phylum level (A) during four different phases. Abundance of Candid atus 
Brocadia  (anammox) and Nitrosomonas (AOB) in biofilm and  flocs at the genus level 
(B) during four different phases.  
 
Thus, 100% pre -Ostara® supernatant negatively affected Ca. Brocadia  in both biofilm and 
suspended biomass. The relative abundance of Ca. Brocadia  increased to 5.3% and 0.2% 
in biofilm and flocs , respectively, when the reactor was fed with 50% post -Ostara® 
A 112 
 supernatant, and the relative abundance of Ca. Brocadia  further increased to 13.9% and 
0.8% in biofilm and flocs , respectively, when t he reactor feed was switched to 100% post -
Ostara® supernatant. Thus post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant feeding promoted the growth 
of anammox  bacteria better than pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant.  
Nitrosomonas  was the most abundant AOB genus in the present study, and was detected in 
both biofilm and flocs  (Figure 5.4B). The relative abundance of AOB was greater in flocs  
than in biofilm, in agreement with AOB activity results and qPCR studies. Nitrospira , 
known as a nitrite oxidizer, was detected with an abundance of less than 0.2%. The key 
microorganism responsible for COD removal was identified as Thauera  (5.1%), which was 
previously reported in denitrifying communities as a phylum of Proteobacteria (Pereira et 
al., 2017 ). Denitrifying phosphorous accumulating organisms (PAO) which was identified 
in the enhanced phosphorus removal flocs  system (Mandel et al., 2019 ), however, was not 
dominant in our nitritation -anammox system.   
5.3.7 Quantitative PCR assay  
The key microbes involved in the N removal process was identified as anammox bacteria 
(dominant by Candidatus Brocadia ) and AOB (dominant by Nitrosomonas ). Anammox 
bacteria and AOB were quantified by real -time qPCR performed on the AMX nirS and 
amoA  genes, respectively. Figure 5.5 shows gene copy numbers of anammox bacteria, 
Nitrosomonas  (AOB) and Nitrospira  (NOB), based on functional gene analysis. The 
increase in phosphate concentration when reactor feed was switched from 50% pre -Ostara® 
lagoon sup ernatant (120 mg PO 43--P/L) to 100% pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant (235 mg 
PO 43--P/L) led to a significant decrease in AMX nirS gene copy numbers (for anammox 
bacteria) from 9.6×106 and 2.6×107 copies/mg VSS biomass  to 3.0×106 and 1.68×107 113 
 copies/mg VSS biomass in suspension and in biofilm, respectively; representing a decrease 
of 69% and 35% of AMX nirS gene copy numbers in suspended biomass and biofilms, 
respectively (P < 0.05).  
 
 
Figure 5.5.  qPCR results of biofilm (A) and flocs  (B) during four operation conditions. 
The AMX nirS gene is the functional nirS gene of anammox bacteria. The amoA gene is 
the functional gene of AOB ( Nitrosomonas ). And the NSR gene is the functional gene of 
NOB ( Nitrospira ). 
 
114 
 After switching the feeding t ype to post -Ostara® lagoon supernatant, AMX nirS gene copy 
numbers increased in both biofilm and flocs. AMX nirS gene copy numbers increased by 
2.38 times (from 1.68 × 107 to 5.68 × 107 copies/mg VSS biomass) in biofilm and 1.13 
times (from 3.0 × 106 to 6.4 × 106 copies/mg VSS biomass) in sludge when the reactor feed 
changed from 100% pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant feeding to 100% post -Ostara® lagoon 
supernatant feeding (P < 0.05).  
AOB abundance was relatively stable under all reactor feeding conditions, w hich were 4.6 
× 107 copies/mg VSS biomass, 4.0 × 107 copies/mg VSS biomass, 4.2 × 107 copies/mg 
VSS biomass and 4.5 × 107 copies/mg VSS biomass from Phase I to Phase IV, respectively. 
The only exception was in the 100% pre -Ostara® lagoon supernatant condit ion in which 
amoA gene copy numbers were slightly reduced. In flocs, the abundance of the amoA genes 
per mg VSS biomass (representing AOB abundance) was significantly higher in flocs  than 
in biofilms (P < 0.01). These results agree with the AOB activity results discussed above 
(Figure 5.1B).  
NSR  gene copy numbers (representing nitrite oxidizer abundance) were about two log units 
lower than AOB copy numbers under all feeding conditions , indicating the successful 
suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria. No significant difference in NSR  gene copy 
numbers was observed in flocs  and biofilm (P > 0.01).  
5.4. Conclusion  
For the first time, the effects of phosphate concentration in a continuo us operating 
nitritation -anammox reactor treating ammonium rich digester sludge thickening lagoon 
supernatant were explored. Ammonium reduction efficiency significantly improved when 
a phosphorus recovery treatment (the Ostara® process) was implemented bef ore lagoon 115 
 supernatant was introduced to the bioreactor. Our studies concluded that phosphate 
concentration was the major inhibitor of anammox bacteria in the reactor; and anammox 
bacteria in biofilm showed greater tolerance than anammox bacteria in flocs  to phosphate 
stress. Further studies on the impacts of environmental and operation conditions on the 
phosphorous inhibition should be carried out to elucidate the overall impact of phosphorus 
on such processes . Results demonstrated that the by placing Osta ra® process as the 
pretreatment for phosphorus reduction, the nitrogen removal efficiency was improved in 
IFAS -SBR nitritation -anammox process treating raw  sludge thickening lagoon supernatant.  
It should be noted that our study focused on elucidating the impact of phosphorus 
concentrations on anammox activities. However, anammox bioreactor treating Pre -Ostara® 
supernatant may be optimized through further operation condition optimization (e.g., 
through reducing nitrogen loading rate, adjusting aeration stra tegies, changing the biofilm 
media filling ratio, and/or feeding strategies), which was not studied in the present paper 
but may be of interest for future studies.

 CHAPTER 6 IMPROVING NITROGEN REMOVAL IN AN IFAS 
NITRITATION -ANAMMOX REACTOR TREATING LAGOON SUPERNATANT 
BY MANIPULATING BIOCARRIER FILLING RAT IO AND HYDRAULIC 
RETENTION TIME4 
6.1. Introduction  
Biological nutrient removal (BNR) is gaining prevalence in wastewater treatment plants 
(WWTP), especially as city  water demand increases and wastewater treatment regulations 
become more stringent (Xu et al., 2014; Nze et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019) . Lagoon 
supernatant is a side stream in WWTP that is rich in ammonium (NH 4+) when compared 
with the frequently studied anaerobic digestate liquor (Shao et al., 2018) . Rather than the 
immediate mechanical separation ( e.g., centrifugation) of the digestate, lagoon supernatant 
offers a natural settling process by storing the digestate for approximately five months, thus 
generating the supernatant feathering with lower temperature  and alkalinity and less 
biodegradable organic matter and suspended solids. Approximately 800 -1200 mg L-1 NH 4+ 
in lagoon supernatant is recirculated to the mainstream and contributes over 1/3 of the total 
nitrogen loading in WWTP (Shao et al., 2018) . Therefore, removing the nitrogen from 
lagoon supernatant is an urgent need and straightforward option to reduce the nitrogen level 
in wastewater discharge.  
Nitritation -anammox process is an emerging BNR technology used for WWTP NH 4+ 
removal, especially in wastewater stream that contain h igh NH 4+ concentration and low

 biodegradable organic matters ( i.e., low C/N ratio) (Boiocchi et al., 2015; Gilbert et al., 
2015; Persson et al., 2017) . This process is more energy/cost efficient (less oxygen input 
and no extra carbo n supplementation) and process effective (in a shortcut of NH 4+—NO 2-
—N2 pathway) as compared to the traditional nitrification and denitrification pathways 
(Rezania et al., 2015; Ramalingam et al., 2017) . Nitritation -anammox  process can be 
achieved in one - or two -stage reactors where NH 4+ is partially oxid ized to NO 2- by 
ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) (nitritation step, equation [1]) and the spare NH 4+ 
react with the AOB produced NO 2- with the assistance of anammox bacteria to produce N 2 
gas, achieving N removal (anammox step, equation [2]). The activity  of AOB contributes 
to dissolved oxygen consumption which positively influence the maintenance of anoxic 
environment which anammox bacteria prefer. NO 3- is a by -product that can be generated 
in the entire process either via the anammox reaction itself (equ ation [2]) or through the 
further oxidation of NO 2- (Strous et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2015b) . Major technical 
challenges exist in both nitritation and anammox steps, including the continuous repression 
of NO 2- oxidation and the difficult cultivation of anammox bacteria in the reactor due to 
their long generation time and low toleranc e to environmental condition changes (Strous 
et al., 1999; Th amdrup, 2012; Ding et al., 2018) .  
The one -stage nitritation -anammox reactor is of utmost engi neering importance in full -
scale application due to its process compactness (Lackner et al., 2014; Gilbert et al., 2015) . 
Achieving synchronous aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidation and heterotrophic 
denitrification (if present) in one reactor requires a precise process control to attain an 
effective balance of micr obial metabolic activities in the competition for available 
resources, such as substrates ( e.g., NH 4+, NO 2- or organic carbons), dissolved oxygen (DO), 122 
 and inhabiting spaces  (Agrawal et al., 2018) . For example, sufficient DO should be 
provided for the growth and activities  of AOB. However, too much DO can lead to 
overgrowth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB), which hamper the nitritation -anammox 
kinetics (Shao et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019) . The presence of organic matter in 
wastewater not only increases the abundance and diversity of heterotrophic bacteria, but 
also proliferates denitrifiers, especially at high ratios of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 
to nitrogen (N) ( e.g., COD/N ≥ 2) (Wang et al., 2018) . Heterotrophic bacteria affect the 
nitritation -anammox process via competing for the available DO with AOB or competing 
for NO 2- with anammox bacteria ( i.e., heterotrophic denitrifica tion) (Wang et al., 2018) . In 
addition, in the biofilm or flocs  system, fast growing bacteria ( e.g., AOB and heterot rophic 
bacteria) tend to grow on the outer layer of biofilms or flocs , which may limit the 
accessibility of nutrients to anammox bacteria (Tsushima et al., 2007; Costa et al., 2014) , 
while protecting anammox bacteria from the hostile environment ( i.e., oxygen or organic 
matter) (Agrawal et al., 2018) . 
The integrated fixed -film activated sludge (IFAS) reactor acts as a unique implementation 
for the nitritation -anammox process by combining both flocs  and biofilm configurations. 
The one -stage IFAS nitritation -anammox process offers a better segregation of anammox 
bacteria and other microbes ( e.g., AOB and heterotrophic denitrifiers, if present) within 
one reactor due to the respective favorable inhabiting environment ( i.e., biofilm or flocs  ) 
(Zhang et al., 2019) . Based on the physical structure and mass transferring feathers of 
biofilm and flocs , the majority of anammox bacteria are retained in the biofilm and AOB 
aggregate within flocs , providing more flexibility on controlling the individual nitritation 
and anammox steps as compared to other one -stage nitritation -anammox reactors (Zhang 123 
 et al., 2015b) . Additional advantages from this process come in the form of a lower 
optimum DO range and eas ier suppression of NOB growth (Hubaux et al., 2015) . Therefore, 
up to 200% higher nitrogen removal efficiency can be achieved in the IFAS type one -stage 
nitritation -anammox reactor when compared to the parallel operated moving bed biofilm 
reactor (MBBR) reactor (Malovanyy et  al., 2015; Trojanowicz et al., 2016) . The highest 
reported nitrogen removal efficiency of 84% is reported in a study by Zhang et al (2015b) , 
where the synthetic digestate liquor was fed at ammonium loading rates of 0.7 -1.3 Kg N 
m-3 d-1. However, other than the explication on reactor feathers, the optimizatio n on the 
IFAS nitritation -anammox reactor operation is still largely unknown, especially for low 
C/N wastewater such as lagoon supernatant.

This study established a lab scale one -stage IFAS sequencing batch reactor (IFAS -SBR) 
for lagoon supernatant nitritation -anammox treatment. The objectives of this study were to 
investigate the reactor nitrogen removal performance at (1) dif ferent biocarrier filling ratios 
and (2) different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The key factors that affect the nitrogen 
removal rates or nitrogen removal efficiency of the process are discussed. Kinetic study 
and microbial analysis were also performe d to assess the respective response of flocs  and 
biofilm biomass under different operation conditions.  
6.2. Materials and Methods  
6.2.1. Reactor operation  124 
 Nitritation -anammox process was operated in a lab -scale IFAS reactor with a diameter of 
17.8 cm, he ight of 35.6 cm, and effective volume of 6 L (Appendix B Figure B -5.4). The 
reactor was seeded with Veolia Anox K™5 carriers (Veolia water technologies, Canada) 
at a biocarrier filling ratio of 35% or 55%. The IFAS reactor was operated in sequencing 
batch mode (so -called “IFAS -SBR”) which comprised of two daily cycles. Each SBR cycle 
lasted for 12 h, including a 5 min feeding, 10 h reaction with intermittent aeration ( i.e., in 
the alternating 105 min aerobic and 15 min anaerobic conditions), 110 min settling, and 5 
min effluent withdrawing. The reactor feed volume exchange ratio (VEX), which 
represents the ratio of influent volume added at the beginning of each cycle and th e reactor 
effective volume, varied from 20% to 42%, leading to the operating HRTs of 1.2 d to 2.5 
d. The selection of operating parameters was mainly based on our previous reactor 
operation and available operating knowledge from the similar research (Li et al., 2016; 
Zhang et al., 2016; Yang et al.,  2019b) .

 The 500 d operation included four different operation stages, distinguished by different 
biocarrier filling ratios (the ratio of total volume of biocarriers to the reactor working 
volume) or different HRTs. The details of the operation conditions are shown  in Table 6.1. 
Similar to our previous research (Yang et al., 2019a) , the reactor was fed with lagoon 
supernatant with the wat er chemistry parameter showing in Table 6.2. The resultant 
volumetric ammonium loading rates (ALR), or nitrogen loading rates (NLR, as the influent 
NO 2- and NO 3- were negligible), for Stages I, II, III, and IV were 0.32 ± 0.00 kg N m-3 d-1, 
0.33 ± 0.00 kg N m-3 d-1, 0.56 ± 0.01 kg N m-3 d-1, and 0.70 ± 0.01 kg N m-3 d-1, respectively. 
A mechanical stirrer (Grainger, Illinois, USA) was used to ensure the reactor was well 
mixed in the reaction phase. An aeration pump (Active Aqua, California, USA) was used 
to ensure the reactor maintained a constant DO between 0.24-0.26 mg L-1 in the aerobic 
phase.  A thermostatic water jacket was used to ensure the liquid temperature in the reactor 
was stabilized at 31±2 °C. There was no sludge discharge during the 500 d operation. Due 
to the metabolic activities of different microbial species (Poot et al., 2016) , pH was 
measured in the range of 7.8 - 8.1 at the beginning o f each SBR cycle and in the range of 
7.2-7.4 at the end of each cycle.  
6.2.2. Specific activity analysis of anammox bacteria and ammonium oxidizing bacteria  
The specific activity of anammox bacteria (SAA) and specific activity of ammonium 
oxidizing bacte ria (SAOB) of flocs  in the bulk solution and biofilm on the carriers was 
measured at each stage by the method described previously (Jubany et al., 2009; 2012; Jin 
et al., 2013; Gilbert et al., 2014) . Floc and biofilm biomass pellets (after centrifugation) 
were washed with phosphate -buffered saline (PBS) at least three times before b eing re -126 
 suspended in mineral medium containing target substrates ( i.e., NH 4+ and NO 2- for SAA 
and NH 4+ for SAOB).

The anaerobic and aerobic condition was maintained separately for SAA and SAOB tests. 
The SAA and SAOB was calculated as the ratio of maximum substrate consumption rate 
and biomass concentration. All batch studies were performed in triplicate.  
6.2.3. Microbial analysis  
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments were performed for microbial 
analysis of biofilm and floc biomass at each stage. DNA isolation kits (MO BIO 
Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, California) were used to extract DNA from biomass samples 
from flocs  and biofilm after biomass samples collected, which were collected from the 
stead y-state of each reactor stage. The extracted DNA was quantified by a DNA 
concentration measurement instrument (NanoDrop One,  Thermo Scientific, Walthan, MA ) 
before being subjected to qPCR experimentation (performed by CFX96TM Real -Time 
Detection System, Bi o-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario). The genes targeted 127 
 by qPCR and corresponding primers used for anammox bacteria, ammonia oxidizing 
bacteria, and denitrification bacteria can be found in Table A -1 (Appendix A). The qPCR 
reaction conditions ar e summarized in Table A -2 (Appendix A). Each qPCR experiment 
was performed in triplicate for individual sample with target genes.  
6.2.4. Chemical and statistical analysis  
Water quality metrics, including COD, NH 4+-N, NO 2--N, and NO 3--N concentrations, were 
measured with Hach reagent kits (Hach Company, Loveland, Colorado) after the liquid 
samples were filtered by 0.45 μm filters (fisherSci, Canada) (Xu et al., 2018) . The total 
nitrogen concentration was determined by the addition of NH 4+-N, NO 2--N, and NO 3--N 
concentrations. Volatile suspended solids (V SS) was measured for the solid samples to 
evaluate the biomass concentration of flocs  and biofilm (Eaton et al., 2011) .  
The widely used statistical analysis method “analysis of variance ( ANOVA)” in single 
factor model was performed for the stati stical comparison of different samples with p -
values smaller than 0.05 indicating the existence of statistical difference (Xu et al., 2019; 
Yang et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2019) .  
6.3. Results and Discussion  
6.3.1. Reactor performance  
6.3.1.1. Nitrogen removal performance  
The influent NH 4+-N concentrations and effluent NH 4+-N, NO 2--N and NO 3--N 
concentrations from the IFAS -SBR reactor were monitored during the 500 d operation 
(Figure 6.1). In the initial 129 -d operat ion (Stage I), at the volumetric ammonium loading 
rate (ALR) of 0.32 ± 0.00 kg N m-3 d-1, the effluent NH 4+-N concentration decreased 
consistently from approximately 260 mg L-1 to below 160 mg L-1 (i.e., 150.1 ± 6.1 mg L-1, 128 
 days 107 -129). The effluent NO 2--N concentration fluctuated in the range of 17 -32 mg L-1 
during the first 2 months and started to stabilize at 10.2 ± 1.6 mg L-1 during the middle of 
Stage I. The effluent NO 3--N concentration fluctuated before stabilizing at 44.5 ± 4.1 mg 
L-1. At the end of Stage I, the removal efficiencies of NH 4+-N and total nitrogen (TN) were 
81.8 ± 0.6% and 74.8 ± 1.1%, respectively (Appendix B Figure B -6.2); the nitrogen 
removal rate (NRR) reached 0.25 ± 0.00 kg N m-3 d-1 (Table 6.1).  
When the biocarrier filling ratio was increased from 35% to 55%, the reactor was operated 
at HRT of 2.5 d for another 134 days (Stage II; days 130 -265). With a constant volumetric 
ALR of 0.33 ± 0.00 kg N m-3 d-1, as in Stage I, the effluent NH 4+-N concentration dec reased 
from 138.8 ± 11.5 mg L-1 (days 130 -159) to 39.1 ± 3.5 mg L-1 after day 238. The effluent 
NO 2--N concentration remained relatively stable at 10.6 ± 2.4 mg L-1 from the beginning 
of Stage II, with the exception of a few small fluctuations. In contrast , there were larger 
fluctuations of the effluent NO 3--N concentration through the entire stage with the peak 
value of 70 mg L-1 on day 209 and lowest value of 42 mg L-1 on day 160. At the end of 
Stage II (days 244 -265), the removal efficiencies of NH 4+-N and TN reached 95.2 ± 0.4% 
and 87.4 ± 0.8%, respectively (Appendix B Figure B -6.2), with NRR being 0.29 ± 0.00 kg 
N m-3 d-1 (Table 6.1). Both nitrogen removal efficiency and removal rates were 
significantly higher (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively) than  those in Stage I, indicating 
a nitrogen removal performance improvement at the higher biocarrier filling ratio.  129 
  
 
Figure 6.1.  Changes in reactor influent and effluent NH 4+-N concentrations (A), effluent 
NO 2--N and NO 3--N concentrations (B) under different operation stages.  
 
At the transition from Stage II to Stage III ( i.e., day 266), the effluent NH 4+-N concentration 
immediately increased to 93.5 ± 7.5 mg L-1, which is likely explained by the sudden 
increase in volumetric ALR (0.56 ± 0.01 kg N m-3 d-1) or decrease in HRT (1.5 d). After 
approximately 90 days of continuous operation, the effluent NH 4+-N concentration  became 
stable at 70.0 ± 4.6 mg L-1 until the last day of Stage III (day 389), which was still higher 
130 
 than the lowest level in Stage II  (i.e., 39.9 ± 3.5 mg L-1). Meanwhile, the effluent NO 2--N 
concentration increased from 10.6 ± 2.4 mg L-1 to 21.3 ± 5.1 mg L-1 within the first 20 d 
operation in Stage III and was stabilized at the latter level until the end of stage. On the 
contrary, the effluent NO 3--N concentration remained relatively constant at 57.3 ± 3.7 mg 
L-1 during the entirety of Stage III. Therefore, in the end of operation in Stage III (days 
365-389), although NRR increased significantly (p < 0.001) to 0.46 ± 0.01 kg N m-3 d-1 
when compared with Stage II, the removal efficiencies of NH 4+-N and TN reduced (p < 
0.05) to 91.8 ± 0.3% and 82.1 ± 0.3%, respectively (Appendix B Figure B -6.2); this is 
discussed further in section 3.1.2.  
The further increase of volumetric ALR ( i.e. 0.70 ± 0.8 mg L-1 as HRT reduced to 1.2 d) in 
Stage IV (days 390 -500) initially led to a quick accumulation of NH 4+-N (171.2 ± 11.0 mg 
L-1) in the reactor effluent (days 390 -406), which gradually declined to 85.8 ± 1.2 mg L-1 
after continuously operating for 2 months. The effluent NO 2--N concentration remained 
stable at 19.9 ± 1.5 mg L-1 after some peak values occurring at the beginning, which did 
not appear to be affected by the elevated ALR. Meanwhile, the effluent NO 3--N 
concentration expressed an ascen ding trend in this stage (IV), increasing gradually from 
the 60.2 ± 2.5 mg L-1 (days 390 -436) to 69.6 ± 0.8 mg L-1 (days 491 -500). This may be due 
to the higher anammox activities at the enhanced ALR (Yang et al., 2019b) . Finally, by 
comparison to Stage III, the removal efficiencies of NH 4+-N and TN in Stage IV dropped 
further (p < 0.05) to 89.6 ± 0.1% and 78.8 ± 0.2% (Appendix B Figure B -6.2), respectively, 
while NRR further increased to 0.54 ±  0.00 kg N m-3 d-1 (Table 6.1) at the end of Stage IV 
(days 491 -500).  
6.3.1.2. Biomass concentration and specific biomass ammonium loading rates  131 
 The biomass concentration was determined in both biofilm and flocs configurations (Figure 
6.2). In principal, the flocs are mainly formed via the proliferation of fast -growing 
organisms feeding on the organics or nutrients of lagoon supernatant and the biomass 
detachment from the inoculated biocarriers. From Stage I to St age II, with the increase of 
biocarrier filling ratio from 35% to 55%, the biofilm biomass increased significantly (p < 
0.01) from 5.2 ± 0.1 g to 7.4 ± 0.2 g while the flocs biomass remained relatively similar 
9.9 ± 0.1 g and 9.5 ± 0.2 g (p = 0.2), leading  to a slight increase of total biomass in the 
reactor from 15.1 g to 16.9 g. In Stage III, both biofilm and flocs biomass increased to 8.6 
± 0.3 g (p < 0.01) and 11.3±0.4 g (p = 0.03), respectively, as more organics and nutrients 
were available for bacteri a growth at the higher influent loading rate (Xu et al., 2014; Nze 
et al., 2018) . However, only biofilm biomass further increased to 10.1 ± 0.6 g (p < 0.01) 
when the influent loading rate continued increasing, while the floc biomass remained 
similar at 12.9 ± 0.4 g (p = 0.06) which was likely  a compromised result under both biomass 
growth and loss via “wash -out”. This observation underlines the advantage of biofilm 
configuration compared to flocs as the flocs were likely more sensitive to the increased 
influent loading rate and were “washed ou t” with the concurrently increased hydraulic 
pressure (van der Star et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2015b) .  
Other than the operating parameter “volumetric  ALR”, the specific biomass ALR (ALR in 
unit biomass) is another critical parameter that could affect the nitrogen removal 
performance (Appendix B Figure B -6.3). The reactor biomass enhancement under the 
increased volumetric ALR was primarily associated wi th the stimulated growth of the 
nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria, as observed in flocs  systems (Xu et al., 2014) , 
which in turn contributed to the nitrogen removal in the reactor. Particularly with lagoon 132 
 supernatant nitritation -anammox t reatment, the population of heterotrophic bacteria in 
biomass is minor due to the low C/N ratio ( i.e., < 0.6), resulting in anammox bacteria and 
nitrifying bacteria ( i.e., AOB) in the dominant position of the biomass components (see 
section 3.2.).  
 
Figure  6.2. Biomass concentration in both biofilm and flocs  configurations under different 
stage operations. Error bars represent standard deviations from different samples (the same 
for the following figures).  
 
However, the growth of biomass associated with the reduced HRT was probably not 
sufficient to withstand the elevated volumetric ALR, which can be attributed to the slow 
growth rate of anammox bacteria and the substrate transfer restriction in biofilm 
confi guration (van der Star et al., 2007) . Therefore, the declined NH 4+-N and TN removal 
efficiencies in Stages III and IV may result from the higher (p < 0.01) specific biomass 
ALRs in these stages (0.17 ±  0.00 kg N kg-1VSS d-1 and 0.18 ± 0.00 kg N kg-1VSS d-1, 
respectively) (Appendix B Figure B -6.3).  
6.3.2. Specific activities of anammox bacteria and AOB bacteria

 The specific anammox activity (SAA) under the steady -state of different stages were shown 
in Figure 6.3A. The SAA of biofilm biomass was significantly higher than that in flocs (p 
< 0.001), as anammox bacteria prefer to aggregate in biofilm to obtain the l ong retention 
time. This has been directly indicated by our microbial community analysis results, which 
showed a significantly higher ( i.e., 1~2 log higher) abundance of AMX nirS gene 
(representing anammox bacteria) in biofilm than that in flocs . Increasin g biocarrier filling 
ratio did not affect (p = 0.09) the SAA in the biofilm, leading to the SAA in Stage I and 
Stage II of 0.26 ± 0.00 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 and 0.27 ± 0.00 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1, respectively. 
However, the biofilm SAA significantly increased to 0. 28 ± 0.00 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 in Stage 
III and to 0.33 ± 0.02 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 in Stage IV (p = 0.02 and p < 0.001, respectively) 
as ALRs increased. Meanwhile, the anammox bacteria gene abundance in biofilm of each 
operation stages were (5.25 ± 0.15 )×107, (5.38 ± 0.27 )×107, (5.78 ± 0.30 )×107, and (6.71 
± 0.21 )×107 copies mg-1 VSS biomass respectively, which showed an increasing trend (p 
< 0.05) from Stage II to Stage IV and provides an explanation of the SAA changes (Figure 
6.3A); this is plausible since simply adding more biocarriers to the reactor does not improve 
the anammo x bacteria density in biofilm, while increasing the ALR does. On the other hand, 
the floc SAAs were 0.09 ± 0.01, 0.09 ± 0.01, 0.07 ± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.01 kg N kg-1 VSS d-
1 in Stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively (Figure 6.3A), which was not affected by the 
increased biocarrier filling ratio either (p > 0.05); however, it started to decrease when the 
HRT declined from Stage II to Stage IV (p = 0.015 and p = 0.003, respectively). Meanwhile, 
a slight decrease of the anammox bacteria abundance in flocs was o bserved from (6.20 ± 
0.21)×106 copies mg-1 VSS biomass in Stage II to (4.31 ± 0.43 )×106 copies mg-1 VSS 
biomass in Stage IV (p < 0.05). The slowly growing bacteria, such as anammox bacteria, 134 
 in our study are less resilient to increased hydraulic pressure w hen the HRT reduced, and 
therefore are more easily flushed out as compared to the microbes which grow faster (van 
der Star et al., 2007) .  
 
 
Figure 6.3.  Specific activities of anammox bacteria (A) and ammonium oxidizing bacteria 
(B) in both biofilm and flocs  configuration in different stages  
 
On the contrary, the specific activity of another important bacteria in reactor — AOB — 
was significantly higher i n flocs  than in biofilm (Figure 6.3B), due to the fact that the 
permeable and loose structures of flocs  provide better access of NH 4+-N and O 2 to AOB. 
135 
 SAOB were 0.32 ± 0.01 and 0.33 ± 0.01 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 in the suspended flocs of Stages 
I and II, respectively, which was not influenced (p = 0.23) by the increased biocarrier filling 
ratio. Flocs  SAOB increased to 0.36 ± 0.01 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 (p = 0.015) in Stage III and 
further increased to 0.38 ± 0.00 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 (p = 0.027) in Stage IV, which was 
associated with the increased volumetric ALR. Likewise, SAOB was related to the density 
of AOB in biomass (Figure 6.3B). During the operation condition changes, only the 
increase of volumetric ALR could enc ourage the growth of AOB, leading to a higher 
density of AOB in floc biomass. This is indicated by the abundance dynamics of amoA 
gene (as AOB representative gene) in flocs  , which showed a similar abundance (p > 0.05) 
in Stage I ([3.51 ± 0.25 ]×107 copies mg-1 VSS biomass)  and Stage II ([3.6 ± 0.08 ]×107 
copies mg-1 VSS biomass), and higher abundances in Stage III ([4.59 ± 0.20 ]×107 copies 
mg-1 VSS biomass) and Stage IV ([4.99 ± 0.20 ]×107 copies mg-1 VSS biomass) (p = 0.046). 
In comparison, SAOB in biofilm were in the significantly lower range of 0.08 ± 0.01~0.10 
± 0.02 kg N kg-1 VSS d-1 during the entire operation, showing no statistical difference 
between stages (p = 0.08, p = 0.4, and p = 0.2, resp ectively). As is evident from the amoA 
gene abundance in biofilm, only a few AOB grew in the biofilm (i.e., 2~3 fold lower than 
that in flocs  ), with a relatively stable (p > 0.9) abundance under all operation conditions, 
which were (1.66 ± 0.12 )×107, (1.64 ± 0.32 )×107 (1.19 ± 0.15 )×107, and (1.18 ± 0.15 )×107 
copies mg-1 VSS biomass, in Stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Based on the multi -layer 
structure of biofilm, most of biofilm AOB aggregated on the biofilm surface and protected 
AOB from the O2 inhibition (Zhang et al., 2015 a).  
Overall, a better segregation of anammox bacteria and AOB was observed in such IFAS 
configurations, which is highlighted with the decreased HRTs. The AOB dominant flocs 136 
 can supply an enhanced NO 2- flow towards the anammox bacteria dominant biofilm 
biomass to support anammox bacteria growth and metabolic activities (Hubaux et al., 2015; 
Zhang et al., 2015b) .  
 
Figure 6.4.  Gene abundance of anammox bacteria (AMX nirS gene), ammonium 
oxidizing bacteria ( amoA  gene), nitrite oxidizing bacteria ( Nitrospira  (NSR) gene) and 
heterotrophic denitrifiers ( nosZ and narG  genes) in both biofilm and flocs  configurations 
in different stag es. 
 
137 
 NOB (Figure 6.4) was highly suppressed in this reactor under all operation conditions, as 
indicated by the negligible gene abundance of NOB ( i.e., Nitrospira  [NSR] gene), which 
was (1.95 ± 0.10 )×105 ~ (3.57 ± 0.30 )×105 copies mg-1 VSS biomass in biofilm phase and 
(2.43 ± 0.30 )×105 ~ (3.34 ± 0.40 )×105 copies mg-1 VSS biomass in flocs phase, which was 
lower than the other selected genes ( i.e., AOB, AMX nirS,  narS  and nosZ ). 
The low biodegradable organic carbon in the lagoon supernatant limited the growth of 
heterotrophic bacteria in the nitritation -anammox process. The population of heterotrophic 
denitrifers (represented by nosZ  and narS genes in our study), which contributed  for the 
NO 3- /NO 2- reduction and COD removal under anoxic condition, were in scarcity compared 
to the anammox bacteria and AOB (Figure 6.4). This is similar to other research in the 
anammox process for wastewater with a low C/N ratio (Malovanyy et al., 2015) .  
6.3.3. Nitrogen removal kinetics  
Nitrogen removal kinetics can be reflected by NH 4+-N oxidation rate, NO 2--N accumulation 
or consumption rates, and NO 3--N accumulation rates in an SBR operating cycle (Figure 
6.5), which were calculated from  the changes of intermediate NH 4+-N, NO 2--N and NO 3--
N concentrations in typical SBR cycles under different operation stages (Appendix B 
Figure B -6.4). In particular, NH 4+-N can be depleted by both aerobic oxi dation (nitritation) 
and anaerobic oxidation (anammox). In the aerobic phase (105 min out of the 120 -min 
cycle), NH 4+ was mainly oxidized to NO 2- by AOB, with a very limited amount of NO 2- 
further oxidized by NOB to NO 3 (nitrification), with both NO 2- and NO 3_ accumulating 
under aerobic condition. The aerobic oxidation rates of NH 4+-N were 0.20 ± 0.02, 0.26 ± 
0.01, 0.36 ± 0.01, and 0.42 ± 0.01 g m-3 min-1 for Stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively, 
while the accumulation rates of NO 2--N were 0.05 ± 0.01, 0 .10 ± 0.01, 0.13 ± 0.01, and 138 
 0.20 ± 0.06 g m-3 min-1, respectively. Regardless of the operation condition difference, the 
oxidation rates of NH 4+-N were 2.1~3.8 times higher than the accumulation rates of NO 2_, 
which may be attributed to the further oxidat ion of NO 2-. The presence of anammox 
activities under such conditions as anoxic zones can be developed inside the flocs and 
biofilm layers (Joss et al., 2009) . However, with the repression of NOB, the further 
oxidation of NO 2- to NO 3- was at a low rate ( i.e., 0.01 ± 0.01 ~ 0.03 ± 0.01 g m-3 min-1) and 
significantly (p < 0.01) lower than the accumulation rate of NO 2-. Further, both NH 4+-N 
oxidation rates and NO 2--N / NO 3--N accumulation rates increased from Stage I to Stage 
IV, perhaps due to the increased biomass concentration.  
 
 
139 
 Figure 6.5.  The rates of NH 4+-N oxidation, NO 2--N consumption and NO 3--N 
accumulation in anaerobic phase of each SBR cycle in different stages (A); the rates of 
NH 4+-N oxidation, NO 2--N accumulation and NO 3--N accumulation in aerobic phase of 
each SBR cycle in different stages (B).  
 
During the anoxic phas e (15 min out of the 120 min cycle) which was shorter than the 
aerobic phase, both NH 4+ and NO 2- were further utilized by anammox bacteria to produce 
N2 gas with a few NO 3- generated as a “by -product” in high efficiency . Meanwhile, a 
certain portion of NO 3- was reduced by heterotrophic denitrifiers to nitrogenous gas (N 2 or 
N2O) through heterotrophic denitrification. The anoxic oxidation rates of NH 4+-N were 
0.29 ± 0.07, 0.46 ± 0.04, 0.67 ± 0.04, and 1.06 ± 0.05 g m-3 min-1 for Stages I, II, III, and 
IV, respectively. These values are much higher than aerobic oxidation rates of NH 4+-N in 
the according stages; the consumption of NO 2--N was 0.32 ± 0.04, 0.59 ± 0.05, 0.81 ± 0.05, 
and 1.25 ± 0.08 g m-3 min-1, for Stages I, II , III, and IV, respectively. Both NH 4+-N and 
NO 2--N consumption rates constantly increased from stage I to Stage IV, providing kinetic 
evidence for the improved nitrogen removal rates.  
With regards to the anammox reaction stoichiometry (Equation [2]), the  ratios of NO 2---N 
consumption to NH 4+-N consumption were 1.14, 1.30, 1.21, and 1.18 for Stages I, II, III, 
and IV respectively, of which the ratio in Stage II was closest to the theoretical value (1.32), 
indicating anammox activity contributed to most N r eduction in Stage II. Moreover, the 
ratio (0.17) of NO 3--N accumulation to NH 4+-N oxidation in Stage II was lower than the 
theoretical value of 0.26, which suggests a possible co -existence of heterotrophic 
denitrification, however, this did not significant ly contribute to the nitrogen removal.  140 
 6.3.4. Environmental application and implication  
In the conventional BNR process, IFAS is well -known as a practical technology to upgrade 
or retrofit the existing flocs process in municipal WWTP. The treatment capacity and 
nitrogen removal performance of the IFAS BNR process can be further improved by 
increasing the biocarriers filling ratios, which increased biomass density, or by increasing 
the ALR, which encouraged the growth of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria (Nze et al., 
2018) . After optimization, the highest nitrogen removal rates (0.56 kg N m-3 d-1) and 
removal efficiencies (87.4%) were achieved in our IFAS nitr titation -anammox reactor . The 
operation cost linked to the optimization strategy of the IFAS -SBR is likely be impacted 
when the reactor filling ratio increases, or the HRT decreases, which affects energy 
consumption associated with liquid mixing, reactor h eating, aeration and pumping. On the 
other hand, enhanced treatment efficiency reduces the footprint of the treatment system, 
and improves effluent quality (Piemonte et al., 2014; Boiocchi et al., 2017; Giwa et al., 
2018) . Details of techno -economic analysis should be conducted when designing 
nitritation -anammox processes. Our research provides important insights on nitritation -
anammox process treating am monium rich wastewater for the future scale -up.  
6.4. Conclusions  
A lab -scale one -stage IFAS  nitritation -anammox reactor was established for lagoon 
supernatant treatment and optimized by altering biocarrier filling ratio and HRTs during 
500 day operation. The nitrogen removal performance was evaluated and compared during 
different reactor operation stages. Nitrogen removal rates were improved from 0.25 kg m-
3 d-1 to 0.29 kg m-3 d-1 by both increasing the biocarrier filling ratio from 35% to 55%, and 
further  improved from 0.29 kg m-3 d-1 to 0.54 kg m-3 d-1 by decreasing HRTs from 2.5 d to 141 
 1.2 d , due to the increased reactor biomass, while nitrogen (NH 4+-N and TN) removal 
efficiencies were only increased with the operation under higher biocarrier filling ratio  
instead of shortening HRTs  with the highest NH 4+-N and TN removal efficiency of 95.2% 
and 87.4%, respectively. A distinct segregation of anammox bacteria and AOB was 
achieved in the IFAS system and was highlighted by the decreased HRTs , which also 
contrib uted to the excellent nitrogen removal ; this was also evident from the SAA and 
SAOB analysis and microbial community analysis. The investigation and comparison of 
nitrogen conversion kinetics supported that the nitritation -anammox process feathers under 
different operation conditions. The specific anammox activity was higher in biofilm than 
in flocs , and vice versa for the specific AOB activity. The present study provides critical 
knowledge for optimizing the one -stage IFAS nitritation -anammox reactor treating 
supernatant of anaerobically digested sludge thicken lagoon.

 CHAPTER 7 THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATED FIXED FILM 
ACTIVIATED SLUDGE REACTOR AND INTERMITTENT AERATION IN 
NITRITATION -ANAMMOX SYSTEMS: UNDERSTANDING REACTOR 
OPTIMIZATION FOR LAGOON SUPERNATANT TREATMENT5 
7.1. Introduction  
Supernatant of anaerobically digested sludge thickening lagoon contains high NH 4+ 
concentration (Shao et al., 2019 ). One stage nitritation -anammox process has been proven 
to be an efficient mean of n itrogen removal in lagoon supernatant treatment due to its low 
aeration and C/N ratio requirements, and high ammonium removal efficiencies (Lotti et al., 
2019 ; Shao et al., 2019 ; Yang et al., 2019a ).  
The dominant microorganisms in the nitritation -anammox system are anammox bacteria 
(i.e., Candidatus Brocadia ; Candidatus Kuenenia; Candidatus Anammoxoglobus, 
Candidatus Jettenia and Candidatus Scalindua ) (Lotti et al., 2014 ; Rodriguez -Sanchez et 
al., 2016 ) and AOB ( i.e., Nitrosomonas ; Nitrosospira; Nitrosolobus; Nitrosovibrio and 
Nitrosococcusare ) (Pynaert et al., 2003 ; Blackburne et al., 2007 ). Nitrite oxidizing bacteria 
(NOB) are a group of nitrifier bacteria easily accreting with AOB in the aerobic 
environment, which compete for oxygen and nitrite sources with AOB and anammox 
bacteria, respectively (Yang et al., 2015 ). Therefore, as widely reported, suppressing the

 activity and population of NOB ( i.e., termination of nitrification) while maintaining the 
activity of both AOB and anammox bacteria is critical to maintain the nitritation -anammox 
process (Li et al., 2011 ; Malovanyy et al., 2015b ; Laureni et al., 2016 ; Qiu et al., 2019 ).   
Operation under DO limited conditions can effectively inhibit NOB growth and activity. 
Both continuous aeration and intermittent aeration have been applied in nitritation -
anammox  systems with low DO conditions ( i.e., < 0.5 mg L-1) (Molinuevo et al., 2009 ; 
Yang et al., 2015 ). For instance, Malovanyy et al. (2015a ) found that the activity of NOB 
and associated nitrate production was strongly limited at a DO concentration of 0.5 mg L-
1.  By applying a sufficient duration of non -aeration phase between aeration periods, the 
activity of NOB is highly limited, which co ntribute to the suppression of NO 3- production 
by NOB  (Corbalá -Robles et al., 2016 ).  However, the impact of intermittent aeration on 
the growth of AOB is still not well understood.  
Systems with biofilm only ( i.e. moving bed biofilm reactor [M BBR]) and hybrid systems 
of flocs and biofilm ( i.e. integrated fixed film activated sludge reactor [IFAS]) have been 
explored for the implementation of the nitritation -anammox process (Wells et al., 2017 ). 
In Veuillet et al  (2014)’s study, IFAS showed a 3 - 4 times higher nitrogen removal 
capability than MBBR treating anaerobic digestate. The objective of this study was to 
identify options to improve the treatment efficiency of nitritation -anammox processes 
when treating ammonium rich lagoon supernatant. During the 438 -day reactor operation, 
this study compared (i) MBBR and IFAS configurations, and (ii) continuous and 
intermittent aeration strategies, and evaluated nitrogen remov al efficiencies and microbial 
community changes.  
7.2. Methods and materials  150 
 7.2.1 Reactor set up  
A bench scale reactor (working volume of 6 L) was operated in a continuous flow mode. 
The reactor was seeded with Veolia Anox K™5 carriers (Veolia Water Technologies, 
Canada) with 55% volume fill ratio. Digested sludge liquor thickening lagoon supernatant 
(Table 7.1) to be used as reactor feed was collected from a biosolids digester sludge 
thickening lagoon in the City of Edmonton once a month. To minimize microbial activity, 
the collected lagoon supernatant was stored at 4 °C prior to use.

The 438 days operational period for nitritation -anammox reactors was divided into five 
periods (Table 7.2). In Periods I and II, MBBR operation mode was applied. In Periods III 
to V, IFAS operation mode was applied and sludge from the treated effluent was collected 151 
 and returned back to the bioreactor (Appendix B Figure B -7.1). The reactor was fed with 
75 % lagoon supernatants in Period I and 100 % during Periods II to V. 75% feed water 
was prepared by diluting the raw lagoon supernatants with deionized (DI)  water in a 3:1 
(feed water: DI water) volume ratio. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.5 d were applied 
in both Periods I and II, then increased to 3.2 d in Periods III and IV by decreasing the 
influent flowrate from 1.6 mL min-1 to 1.25 mL min-1 (Perist altic pump model: 77200 -60, 
Masterflex, Cole -Parmer, Illinois, USA), then reduced to 2.5 d in Phase V. Continuous 
aeration was applied in Periods I to III which was replaced by an intermittent aeration 
regime (i.e., alternating 105 min aeration and 15 non -aeration) in Periods IV to V with DO 
maintained between 0.18 - 0.19 mg L-1 (Table 7.2). The reactor was equipped with a heat 
jacket (Xuanyuan, Yancheng, China) to maintain a constant liquid temperature of 28.5± 
1.4 °C.  
7.2.2 Sample collection and analytica l methods  
Reactor influent and effluent samples were collected every day for COD, NH 4+, NO 3-, and 
NO 2- analysis using reagent kits (methods 8000, 10205, 10206, and 10207, respectively, 
Hach Company, Loveland, Colorado). The system was considered stable if effluent 
characteristics became stable for at least one week. Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) 
and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) were measured weekly using 
Standard Methods 2540B (Eaton et al. 2011).  
7.2.3 Activity measurement  
The specific activity of anammox (SAA) and ammonium oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) under 
steady state conditions were determined following methods described by Jin et al. (2013 ). 152

Serum bottles were deoxygenized by purging N 2 gas for 25 min, and then immediately 
sealed with butyl rubber before bein g placed in a thermostatic shaker operated at 31 ± 1 °C 
and 180 rpm. The biomass concentration and pH were measured at the end of each test. 
SAA was calculated as the maximum substrate consumption rate divided by VSS. Activity 
of heterotrophic denitrifiers  was determined by the same methodology. Sodium nitrate and 
sodium acetate were used as the substrates with concentrations of 50 and 100 mg COD L-
1, respectively. The oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was measured indirectly by tracking the 
pressure decrease in the  headspace, which was used to determine the aerobic bacteria (AOB 153 
 and NOB) activity (Gilbert et al., 2014b ). Sodium azide (NaN 3) is a commonly used 
inhibitor to supress NOB activity and was used for testing spe cific AOB activity. Sludge 
samples were suspended in mineral medium containing substrates (i.e., NH 4+ and NO 2- for 
SAA and NH 4+ for SAOB, NO 2- for SNOB and sodium nitrate and sodium acetate for 
specific activity of denitrifier).  
7.2.4. q -PCR analysis and MiSeq sequencing  
Sludge and biofilm samples were collected from the reactor during different periods under 
stable conditions. DNA was extracted  from sludge and biofilm samples with MO BIO 
PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kits (MoBio Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, California). 
Anammox bacteria, AOB bacteria, NOB bacteria, and denitrification bacteria were 
analyzed by qPCR (Bio -Rad Laboratories (Canada) Ltd. , Mississauga, Ontario). 
Information about qPCR primers and target genes is provided in Table A -1 (Appendix A). 
Extracted DNA samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform at the Research 
and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, TX, USA) to investigate dive rsity and community 
composition. The detailed analyze information is described in our previous study (Yang et 
al., 2019b ).  
7.2.5. Statistical analysis  
Statistical analysis was performed using the t -test at 5 % probability level and reported as 
p-values. A statistically significant difference is evident from a p -value smaller tha n 0.05.  
7.3. Results  
7.3.1. Reactor operation  154 
 Figure 7.1 shows the bioreactor performance in terms of the influent and effluent 
concentrations of NH 4+, NO 2- and NO 3-. Figure 7.1B shows the nitrogen loading rate (NLR) 
and nitrogen removal rate (NRR) at different periods. The NH 4+ removal percentage 
decreased from 65 ± 2.3 % in Period I (days 1 - 72) to 56 ± 5.5 % in Period II (days 73 – 
144) (P < 0.05), likely due to change in reactor feed, which was increased from 75 % lagoon 
supernatant ( i.e. , 620 ± 2 7 mg NH 4+-N L-1) to 100 % lagoon supernatant ( i.e.,  835 ± 45 
mg NH 4+-N L-1). The NO 2- concentration in the reactor effluent was as low as 1.5 ± 1.3 mg 
NO 2--N L-1 in Period I and 2.0 ± 1.1 mg NO 2--N L-1 in Period II, which is below the reported 
NO 2--N accu mulation range causing inhibition of anammox activity (Wells et al., 2017 ). 
The AOB -produced NO 2- was consumed immediately by anammox bacteria. A low aerobic 
ammonium oxidation rate in Periods I and II could lead to a relatively low anammox 
oxidation rate, which was likely the reason for the low NH 4+ removal percentage. Although 
a higher influent NH 4+ concentration in Period II may have stimulated the growth of AOB, 
it did not improve the NH 4+ removal rate by a significant amount. In order to examine the 
impact of IFAS operation on reactor performance, IFAS mode (days 145 - 230) was applied 
in Period I II. In the meantime, HRT was increased from 2.5 to 3.2 d to maintain the reactor 
stability due to the change of reactor operation strategy. An enhanced NH 4+ removal 
percentage (74 ± 4.8 %) with a significant accumulation of NO 2- accumulation (23.5 ± 5.6 
mg NO 2--N L-1) was observed. This was significantly higher when compared to previous 
periods (P < 0.05). Our batch studies demonstrated that AOB activity was higher in the 
sludge (0.318 ± 0.017 kg N [kg VSS d]-1), as compared to the biofilm (0.085 ± 0.010 kg  N 
[kg VSS d]-1). By returning the settled flocs from the clarifier into the bioreactor, more 
AOB can be retained in the reactor.  155

concentrations of NH 4+-N, NO 2--N and NO 3--N; 1B: the nitrogen loading rate (NLR) and 
nitrogen removal rate (NRR) at different phases; 1C: Flocs /biofilm concentration in the 
reactor.  
 
However, the decreased NLR along with the increased HRT may reduce the anammox 
activity in biofilm, leading t o an accumulation of NO 2- (Yang et al., 2019b ). This is a clear 
evidence of the suppression of NOB, which could otherwise oxidize the accumulated NO 2- 
in the system. With the application of intermittent aeration in Period IV (days 231 - 370), 
the effluent concentration of NO 2- decreased to 12.3 ± 2.3 mg NO 2--N L-1) (P < 0.05) with  
the NH 4+ removal percentage significantly increasing to 91.8 ± 1.2 %. Results indicated 
that the application of intermittent aeration favored the growth of anammox bacteria, which 
may optimize the living environment for anammox bacteria, as shown by Miao et al. (2017 ). 
The NH 4+ removal percentage in Period IV (92.2 ± 2.1%) was not significantly affected 
(P > 0.05) by a reduction of HRT from 3.2 d to 2.5 d when operation switched to Period V 
(days 371 - 438),  indicating the nitrogen removal rates can be improved without 
compromising nitrogen removal efficiency in the IFAS system.  
From Period I to II, biofilm biomass remained relatively stable between 1174 ± 34 mg VSS 
L-1 to 1200 ± 32 mg VSS L-1 (P > 0.05) while the flocs concentration was measured as low 
as 110 ± 38 mg VSS L-1 and 182 ± 36 mg VSS L-1 , attributed largely from the detachment 
of biofilm biomass and suspended solids in influent with an actual SRT of 2.5 d. S tarting 
from Period III, the discharged flocs was recirculated to the reactor where a SRT of 14 ± 
2.1 d was maintained. This led to a significant increase of flocs concentration to 961 ± 67 157 
 mg VSS L-1 (P < 0.05). In Period IV, with the application of inter mittent aeration, the flocs 
concentration reached a comparable concentration of 1023 ± 93 mg VSS L-1 (P > 0.05) 
while the biofilm biomass further increased from 1247 ± 23 mg VSS L-1 to 1323 ± 34 mg 
VSS L-1 (P < 0.05). This observation was likely linked to the application of non -aeration 
phase resulting in more favorable conditions for anammox bacteria growth; which is 
discussed further in 3.3. In Period V, both of the biofilm and flocs concentrations 
significantly increased to 1507 ± 35 mg VSS L-1 and 1174 ± 98 mg VSS L-1 (P < 0.05), 
respectively. This can be explained by the fact that a higher NLR ( i.e., from 0.23 kg N [m3 
d]-1 in period IV to 0.31 kg N [m3 d]-1 in period V) provided more available nutrients ( i.e., 
NH 4+ and NO 2-) for the growth and activity  of autotrophic bacteria ( i.e. AOB and anammox 
bacteria) (Yang et al., 2019b ), which improved N removal efficiency.  
7.3.2. Activities of different groups of microorganisms  
The activities of AOB, anammox bacteria, NOB, and heterotrophic denitrifiers were 
determi ned in both biofilm and flocs to further compare the operation at different periods 
(Figure 7.2). Specific AOB activity (SAOB) in the flocs significantly increased from 0.151 
± 0.015 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 in Period I to 0.161 ± 0.012 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 in Perio d II, then 
to 0.315 ± 0.015 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 in Period III, then to 0.312 ± 0.012 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 
in Period IV, and finally to 0.318 ± 0.017 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 in Period V (P < 0.05 for all 
increases). This was due to the change in opera tion mode from MBBR to IFAS. The 
resulting SRT for flocs increase from 2.5 d to 14 d retained a significantly higher population 
of AOB in the suspended phase. Meanwhile, the application of intermittent aeration in 
Periods IV to V led to a decrease of SAOB in the biofilm configuration from 0.168 ± 0.012, 
0.158 ± 0.011, and 0.165 ± 0.012 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 in Periods I to III, respectively, to 158 
 0.092 ± 0.009 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 in period IV and 0.085 ± 0.010 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 in 
period V in the biofilm phase (P < 0.05). Therefore, the application of intermittent aeration 
led to the different responses of SAOB in biofilm and flocs based on our observation.  
The specific anammox activity (SAA) of the biofilm biomass was significantly  higher (P 
< 0.01) than that of the flocs in all the operation periods, which was similar to many 
previous studies (Zhang et al., 2015 ; Yang et al., 2019a ; Yang et al., 2019b ). Anammox 
bacteria prefer to proliferate in the biofilm phase where an ext remely long SRT can be 
reached (Yang et al., 2019b ).

Figure 7.2.  Specific activity of different groups of bacteria (anammox bacteria (A), AOB 
(B), NOB bacteria (C) and denitrifies (D)) in biofilm and flocs  
 
In Periods I to III, the SAA of biofilm remained between 0.102 - 0.123 kg N (kg  VSS d)-1 
where continuous aeration strategy was applied. With the application of intermittent 
aeration in Periods IV to V, the SAA increased significantly to 0.189 ± 0.015 kg N (kg 
VSS d)-1 and 0.192 ± 0.012 kg N (kg VSS d)-1, respectively. While in the flocs 
configuration, the SAA was relative stable during Periods I to V, which were at 0.045 ± 
0.002, 0.056 ± 0.005, 0.065 ± 0.008, 0.056 ± 0.003, and 0.079 ± 0.005 kg N (kg VSS d)-1, 
160 
 respectively, indicating an equal distribution of anammox bacteria in the flocs irrespective 
of the operation status change.  
Specific NOB activities were at a comparably low level in both the biofilm and flocs phase. 
The application of intermittent aeratio n in Periods IV to V significantly reduced the specific 
NOB activity from 0.078 ± 0.012 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 (Period III, continuous aeration phase) 
to 0.012 ± 0.01 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 (Period V, intermittent aeration phase) in biofilm biomass 
(P < 0.01) and fr om 0.069 ± 0.005 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 (Period III, continuous aeration phase) 
to 0.038 ± 0.008 kg N (kg VSS d)-1 (Period V, intermittent aeration phase) in floc biomass 
(P < 0.01). Meanwhile, it has been noticed that the NOB activity in biofilm became 
signifi cantly lower than that of flocs after applying intermittent aeration. The ratio of AOB 
activity and NOB activity was 2.2 times higher in flocs than that in biofilm biomass. NOB 
growth has previously been reported to be successfully suppressed by applying i ntermittent 
aeration accompanied by low DO condition with an low NOB abundance of 2.0 - 2.6 % 
(Ma et al., 2015 ), which helps explain the similar observation in ou r study.  
Due to the low C/N ratio in the feed, the activity of heterotrophic denitrifiers was limited. 
The activity of heterotrophic denitrifies in biofilm phase (0.02 to 0.05 kg N [kg VSS d]-1) 
was significa ntly lower (P < 0.01) than that in the flocs phase (0.13 ± 0.02 kg N [kg VSS 
d]-1), which may due to the better accessibility of nutrients in the flocs (Hubaux et al., 2015 ). 
7.3.3 Microbial community dynamics  
The microbial community structure in biofilm biomass and flocs biomass at the end of 
period V were investigated. The relative abundances of microbial taxa were demonstrated 
at the phylum (Appendix B Figur e B-7.2A) and genus (Appendix B Figure B -7.2B) levels. 161 
 In the biofilm biomass samples, the phylum Bacterioidetes  (55.2 %) was most prominent, 
followed by Chloroflexi  (13.0 %), Planctomycetes  (12.7 %), Proteobacteria  (9.9 %), 
Acidobacteria (2.0 %), and Gemmatimonadetes (1.8%). The most abundant phylum in 
flocs  samples was Bacteroidetes  (41.3 %), followed by Proteobacteria  (28.3 %), 
Chloroflexi (12.2 %) , Gemmatimonadetes (5.9 %), Acidobacteria (5.24 %), and 
Planctomycetes  (2.18 %). At the gen us level, Candidatus Brocadia  in the phylum 
Planctomycetes  was most prominent (Appendix B Figure B -7.2), accounting for 11.63 % 
of biofilm communities, but only 1.04 % of flocs in period V. The most abundant AOB 
genus was Nitrosomonas , whi ch was detected in both biofilm (0.13 %) and flocs  (0.57 %). 
Only one genus of NOB, Nitrospira  was detected with a relative abundance below 0.10 %. 
Thauera  (2.12 % in flocs phase and 0.65 % in biofilm phase) was the dominant 
heterotrophic denitrifiers.  
The quantitative real -time PCR analysis was performed to quantify the abundances of 
anammox bacteria, AOB, NOB, and heterotrophic denitrifies in the biofilm and flocs  
(Figure 7.3). The abundance of AMX nirS in both the biofilm biomass and floc biomass 
increased significantly (P < 0.05) from 1.02 × 107 copies mg-1 VSS and 1.12 × 106 copies 
mg-1 VSS respectively in period I to 4.17 × 107 copies mg-1 VSS and 4.30 × 106 copies mg-
1 VSS respectively in period V (Figure 7.3A) , although relatively low abundance w as 
observed in the flocs . This correlated well with the maximum nitrogen removal efficiency 
observed in Period V.  162 
  
Figure 7.3. A: Abundance of nitrogen transforming groups of bacteria (anammox 
bacteria, AOB, NOB and denitrifiers) in the flocs ; 3B: Abundance of nitrogen 
transforming groups of bacteria in the biofilm on the carriers. Note: The units for all 
numbers are gene copies/m g VSS biomass. amoA is the targeted functional gene for 
AOB; NSR is for Nitrospira; nosZ, and narG are for denitrifiers' functional genes; AMX 
nirS is for the Anammox.  
 
The amoA gene copy concentration represents the AOB abundance in the reactor. In the 
biofilm phase, the AOB abundance remained constant in Periods I to III (P > 0.05) and 
163 
 then decreased significantly (P < 0.02) from 3.28×107 copies mg-1 VSS in period III to 1.04 
× 107 copies mg-1 VSS in Peri od IV, then further to 9.98 × 106 copies mg-1 VSS in Period 
V when operation switched from continuous aeration condition to intermittent aeration 
conditions. In the flocs phase, the abundance of AOB increased significantly  (P < 0.01) to 
2.12 × 107 copies mg-1 VSS after altering operation mode from MBBR to IFAS in Period 
III. After that, the intermittent aeration application did not further lead to a significant 
change in AOB abundance in flocs , (P > 0.05) which was 2.14 × 1 07 copies mg-1 VSS in 
Period IV and 2.26 × 107 copies mg-1 VSS in Period V .The abundance analysis of AOB 
correlated well with the results of SAOB.  
Figure 7.3C shows the gene copy numbers of heterotrophic denitrifiers in biofilm and flocs , 
based on functional genes nosZ and narG. Both, nosZ and narG remained relatively 
stabilized in the biofilm biomass with no significant difference (P > 0.05). In the  flocs , the 
abundance of nosZ and narG increased from 2.06 × 106 copies mg-1 VSS and 1.03 × 106 
copies mg-1 VSS respectively in Period II to 3.06 × 106 copies mg-1 VSS and 1.43 × 106 
copies mg-1 VSS in Period III respectiv ely with no further significant changes in the 
remaining operation periods. This indicates that the heterotrophic denitrifiers have a better 
growth in IFAS systems ( i.e., mainly in the flocs ) as compared to MBBR, which is 
plausible since the flocculent str ucture provides ease of accessibility of substrates for 
heterotrophic growth (Zubrowska -Sudol and Walczak, 2014 ). However, under organic -
limiting conditions, the growth of heterotrophic bacteria was not competitive with 
anammox bacteria overall, as can be seen in Figure B -7.3 (Appendix B).  
NOB abundance remained low during all five periods. After applying intermittent aeration, 
the abundance of NOB became significantly lower (P < 0.01) due to the influence of the 164 
 non-aeration period, indicating an improved suppression of NOB occurring under 
intermittent aeration operation (Sobotka et al., 2015 ). 
7.4. Discussion  
7.4.1 MBBR VS IFAS operation  
It has been demonstrated in previous research that IFAS has a 3 - 4 times higher nitrogen 
removal than MBBR systems operating in parallel (Veuillet et al., 2014 ). Our results agree 
with these findings and have built upon this knowledge with the application for the 
treatment of lagoon supernatant. Given both biofilm and suspended floc configurations, 
IFAS provided better segregation of AOB and anammox bacteria, lea ding to an optimized 
inhabiting environment for each microorganisms (Malovanyy et al., 2015a ). For example, 
the diffusion limitation of dissolved oxygen and  NH 4+-N in biofilm configuration 
suppresses the growth of AOB and subsequently affects anammox activity (Miao et al., 
2017 ). As a relatively fast growing bacteria, AOB tends to grow in the outer layer of biofilm, 
which li kely leads to a denser and thicker biofilm, thus decreasing the accessibility of 
substrates for other microorganisms ( e.g., anammox bacteria) (Verhamme et al., 2011 ). 
This likely limited the growth of AOB in turn d ue to the biofilm thickness limitation. 
Therefore, a larger population of AOB can be retained in the IFAS system ( i.e., in the flocs ), 
which optimizes the NO 2- flow for anammox bacteria in the biofilm (Veuillet et al., 2014 ). 
When the suspended biom ass concentration reached its highest at 1320 ± 125 mg L-1 in 
Period V, the NRR increased by 2 - fold from 0.14 ± 0.012 to 0.28 ± 0.03 kg N (m3·d) -1, 
and the NH 4+-N removal efficiency significantly increased (P < 0.01) from 56 ± 5.5 % to 
92.2 ± 2.1 %, as compared to Period I. Both the IFAS and application of intermittent 
aeration contributed to the performance improvements. As the limiting step of nitritation -165 
 anammox process (Szatkowska et al., 2007 ), NO 2- production via the activity of AOB is 
critical and can be better conducted in IFAS systems; this was reflected by the higher N 
removal efficiency in Period III as compared to Periods I and II.  This finding was also 
confirmed by the significantly higher AOB activity of the flocs (Figure 7.3) accompanied 
with the higher flocs concentration (Figure 7.2) in Period III, leading to an improved 
contribution of NO 2- production from the flocs configuration. Although some research 
(Gatti et al., 2015 ) indicated the longer SRT ( i.e., 14 d in the IFAS) may improve the 
retention of NOB in the reactor, the NOB population did  not further increase in Period III 
(Figure 7.3).  
The reduced NLR in Period III compromised the activity improvement of anammox 
bacteria in the biofilm (Figure 7.2). Thus, the imbalance of SAA and SAOB at this period 
caused the NO 2- accumulation (Figure 7 .1) in the reactor and increased the risk of 
enhancing NOB activity (Figure 7.2C). Although the activity of heterotrophic denitrifiers 
improved in the IFAS during Period III, further enhancement of heterotrophic 
denitrification may have been limited by the  lack of available biodegradable COD 
(Appendix B Figure B -7.3).  
7.4.2 Intermittent aeration impact on nitrogen removal  
Low DO concentration (0.18 - 0.19 mg L-1) in both continuous and intermittent mode 
successfully suppressed the NOB growth (Figure 7.3), which gave anammox bacteria an 
advantage in competing for the NO 2--N with NOB bacteria, as comparable with previous 
studies (Wang et al., 2018 ; Yang et al., 2019b ), regardless of reactor configuration. 
However, as reported in Zekker et al. (2017 )’s study, the continuous aeration may increase 
the chance of NOB acclimation to the low DO environment, which could lead to a failure 166 
 of suppression of NOB in the long -term operation . In our study, the continuous aeration 
led to an accumulation of NO 2- (Period III), which disturbed the subsequent anammox 
activity. Therefore, with the introduction of non -aeration in intermittent aeration regime, 
the activity of AOB in biofilm configuration was reduced while the anammox activity in 
biofilm was enhanced (Figure 7.2), which led to an increase in the overall nitrogen removal 
performance. The decrease of AOB activity in the biofilm (Periods III  to V) may be 
attributed to (1) the low amount of oxygen supplied during non -aeration phases and (2) 
substrate diffusion limitation for the biofilm biomass. However, non -aeration phase 
provided favorable conditions for the growth of anammox bacteria throug h reducing 
oxygen inhibition (Ma et al., 2015 ; Qiu et al., 2019 ). The growth of NOB (Figure 7.3) was 
also significantly reduced under intermittent aeration and led to a lower specific activity of 
NOB (Figure 7.2), which is in agreement with previous studies (Gilbert et al., 2014a ; Zhang 
et al., 2017 ).  
According to the nitritation -anammox stoichiometry reaction (Equation S2), 11% of NH 4+ 
is converted to NO 3- by anammox bacteria (Yang et al., 2019b ). In theory, effluent NO 3- 
concentration would be 33.5 ± 2.2, 45.6 ± 4.1, 54.2 ± 5.9, 66.7 ± 2.8, and 84.2 ±7.1 mg 
NO 3--N L-1 Periods I through V, respectively. In our study, the practical effluent NO 3- 
concentration was 23.1 ± 2.2, 22.1 ± 3.1, 38.9.1 ± 5.8, 52.1 ± 6.2, and 62.1 ± 3.6 mg NO 3-
-N L-1 in Periods I through V, which is much lower than the theoretical effluent NO 3--N 
concentrations. Heterotrophic denitrification may have occurred, which reduced NO 3- 
concentration through COD oxidation.  As shown in Figure B -7.3 (Appendix B), COD 
removal percentages were in the range of 22% to 35% in the present study.  
7.5. Conclusion  167 
 Optimized nitrogen removal efficiency and nitrogen removal rates  in a single -stage 
nitritation -anammox CSTR treating lagoon supernatant were achieved by both 
recirculating flocs and applying intermittent aeration. The highest NH 4+ removal efficiency 
of 92.2 ± 2.1 % was achieved under a NLR of 0.34 ± 0.03 kg N (m3·d) -1 in the IFAS -mode 
operated CSTR with intermittent aeration. The successful suppression of NOB was 
observed under all operation periods and the growth of NOB bacteria was significantly 
reduced by applying intermittent aeration. Heterotrophic denitrification was also improved 
under the optimized operation condition.

 CHAPTER 8 LONG -TERM CONTINUOUS NITRITATION -ANAMMOX 
REACTOR AERATION OPTIMIZATION AT DIFFERENT NITROGEN 
LOADING RATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF AMMONIUM RICH 
DIGESTATE LAGOON SUPERNATANT  
8.1. Introduction  
Excessive nitrogen in wastewater effluents threatens ecological systems and public health 
by causing eutrophication in natural water bodies (Xu et al., 2014; O'Brien et al., 2019). 
Nitrogen reduction from wastewater is mandatory in many countries, which is  typically 
achieved through nitrification -denitrification under aerobic then anoxic conditions, 
respectively (Xu et al., 2013). Though effective, it is costly, energy -demanding and less 
efficient when treating high -strength ammonium wastewaters. Further, s uch biological 
nitrogen reduction often required the addition of organic carbon (e.g. methanol) to optimize 
the carbon -to-nitrogen ratio (C/N) (Hvala et al., 2018), adding to overall treatment costs.  
Since the 1990s, along with the research of novel nitro gen reduction strategy known as 
“anammox” (i.e., anaerobic ammonium oxidation) (van der Star et al., 2010), the rapid 
development of partial nitritation and anammox (or nitritation -anammox) processes was 
identified for high ammonium wastewater treatment. U nlike the conventional nitrification -
denitrification process, where influent ammonium (NH4+) is completely converted into 
nitrate (NO3 -), which is then reduced to nitrogen gas through heterotrophic denitrification, 
nitritation process only partially oxidiz es NH4+ to nitrite (NO2 -), while anammox bacteria 
denitrify NO2 - using NH4+ as the electron donor. The nitritation -anammox process 
therefore, results in more energy -efficient and less costly treatment than the conventional 
nitrification -denitrification pro cess (Fux et al., 2002).  174 
 Persistent suppression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) converting NO2 - to NO3 - is 
imperative for high and stable performance of the nitritation -anammox process to ensure 
the availability of NO2 - for anammox bacteria. The abund ance of NOB has been observed 
to be less than 1% in a successful nitritation -anammox reactor (Wang et al., 2018). 
Generally, NOB can be eliminated by adjusting operational parameters. For example, 
maintaining short solids retention time (SRT) (i.e., 1~2 d)  has been shown to effectively 
wash out NOB (Liu and Wang, 2014), while at the same time short SRTs eliminate 
anammox bacteria in flocs . On the other hand, operating nitritation -anammox reactors 
under low dissolved oxygen (DO) environments favors AOB due t o their relatively higher 
oxygen affinity when compared to NOB (Guisasola et al., 2005). However NOB may 
acclimatize to these conditions over the long term (Zekker et al., 2017). In contrast, 
application of an intermittent aeration regime provides a better  solution for the suppression 
of NOB under low DO conditions (Liu and Wang, 2013). Additionally, the non -aerated 
phases are beneficial to the anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers as they allow 
the deoxygenation of the outer layer of the biofilm and flocs associated with treatment 
(Zubrowska -Sudol et al., 2011).  
The optimization of operational parameters for intermittent aeration such as the duration 
and DO level of aeration cycles is well studied. Zubrowska -Sudol et al. (2011) reported 
that long er aeration periods encouraged NOB suppression while Gilbert et al. (2014) found 
NOB require a longer resuming time than AOB at the switch from anoxic to aerobic 
environments. Furthermore, the adjustment of DO concentration for NOB suppression has 
been alr eady investigated  (Wyffels et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2016) as have strategies to 
optimize oxygen supply in nitritation/anammox systems (Mauricio -Iglesias et al., 2015; 175 
 Boiocchi et al., 2016). However, many of these studies just focus on one average nitr ogen 
loading rate and neglect the variety of operational limitations when different nitrogen 
loadings are applied. In the current work, we undertook a more comprehensive 
investigation of the partial nitritation/anammox process where we not only changed the  
aeration regime but also the nitrogen loading rate to comprehensively assess a single -stage 
IFAS partial nitritation/anammox system.  
8.2. Materials and methods  
8.2.1. Feed water quality  
As disclosed in the introduction, the influent water used was the anaerobically digested 
biosolid thickening  lagoon supernatant. Lagoon supernatant is an ammonium rich side 
stream in wastewater treatment plant. As shown in Table 8.1, NH 4+-N (855 ± 45 mg/L) was 
the main inorganic nitrogen species in the reactor influent, which can be transformed into 
NO 2--N, NO 3--N, or nitrogen gas by different microbial communities through nitritation -
anammox and heterotrophic denitrification processes (Yang et al. 2019a ). The soluble 
COD concentration was 568 ± 54.42 mg/L with the biodegradable fraction of 182 ± 32 
mg/L,  providing a low C/N ratio. The P O43--P concentration (32 ± 5.4 mg/L), FA 
concentration (12.7 ± 1.4 mg/L) and FNA concentration (0.0010 ± 0.0006 mg/L) were 
below the commonly reported inhibition ranges for both NOB and anammox bacteria 
(Yang et al. 2019a ). 
8.2.2. Reactor set up and operation  176 
 The IFAS system was implemented as a continuous operation with a working volume of 6 
Liters. It was operated for 312 days, during which the following phases can be identified 
according to the accomplished HRT: Phase I with an HRT of 2.5 d (from day 1 to 64 ), 
Phase II with an HRT of 2.0 d (from day 65 to 162), Phase III with an HRT of 1.5 d (from 
day 163 to 246), and Phase IV with an HRT of 1.2 d (from day 247 to 312). The raw lagoon 
supernatant (see Table 8.1) was supplied continuously to the reactor by a p eristaltic pump 
(Easy - load® II, Model: 77200 -60, Masterflex, Cole -Parmer, Illinois, USA) at influent flow 
rates of 1.61, 1.97, 2.65, and 3.32 mL/min in Phase I to Phase IV, respectively, to 
accomplish the different HRTs.

The anammox inoculum was seeded with Veolia Anox K ™5 carriers (Veolia Water 
Technologies, Canada) with 55% filling ratio (Yang et al. 2019a ). The temperature of the 177 
 mixed liquor was controlled at 29 .2 ± 1.2 °C using a heat jacket (Xuanyuan, Yancheng, 
China).  
A mechanical stirrer (Grainger, USA) was used to mix the liquid in the reactor thoroughly, 
thus allowing biomass -substrate contact. The intermittent aeration was applied throughout 
all the phase s with cycles of 105 -minute aerated periods followed by 15 minutes of non -
aeration. The DO during the aeration period was altered in each phase and sub -phase by 
adjusting the air pump flow rate (Active Aqua, Model: AAPA45L, Hydrfarm, California, 
USA) using  an air flow meter (Model: MR3A02SVVT, Pennsylvania, USA). The bulk DO 
concentration, monitored daily using a DO meter (YSI 6050020 Pro20, Cole - Parmer, 
Illinois, USA), ranged as follows: 0.18 -0.20 mg/L in Phase I and in Phase II -1 (days 65 -
115), 0.22 -0.24 mg/L in Phase II -2 (days 116 -162) and in Phase III -1 (days 163 -203), 0.24 -
0.28 mg/L in Phase III -2 (days 204 -246) and in Phase IV -1 (days 247 -286), and 0.28 -0.35 
mg/L in Phase IV -2 (days 287 -312).   
Effluent from the biological reactor was carried to a cl arifier in order to achieve high 
retention time of biomass flocs . Specifically, a sludge recycle ratio of 1:1 was maintained 
for influent wastewater. The SRT was maintained at 12.6 ± 4.2 days throughout the entire 
operational period. The liquid pH in the r eactor was between 7.1 - 7.6 for the duration of 
operation according to the daily measurements.  
8.2.3. Reactor performance analysis  
The reactor performance was evaluated by influent and effluent water chemistry 
determination. The influent and effluent wate r samples were collected at least twice a week 
and filtered through 0.45 μm filters (fisherSci, Canada) before intermediate measurement 178 
 (Xu et al. 2018b ; Yang et al. 2019a ). Concentration of soluble chemical oxygen demand 
(COD), NH 4+-N, NO 2--N, and NO 3--N were chosen as targ ets and measured using the Hach 
methods (Hach Company, Colorado, U.S.). Inorganic nitrogen balance was performed with 
the individual inorganic nitrogen species. Inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency was 
calculated based on influent and effluent total inorg anic nitrogen concentrations. Free 
ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA) concentrations were determined based on 
Equations 1 and 2.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed f or the statistical comparison of different 
samples with a p -value less than 0.05 indicating a statistically significant difference.  
8.2.4. Biomass and microbial analysis  
Biomass samples of biofilm and mixed liquor were collected during the optimum steady -
state conditions of each phase for both volatile suspended solids (VSS)  and microbial 
analysis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments were carried out 
using the exacted DNA of biomass samples following the method described in our prev ious 
study (Yang et al. 2019a ) (see Appendix A  Table A -1). The  biofilm  thickness was 
measured with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710), following the method described 
in our previous study (Xu et al. 2018a ).  179 
 8.2.5. Specific biomass activities  
Within each stage, the specific activity of anammox bacteria (SAAB) and ammonium 
oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) of flocs and biofilm on the carriers were measured by a 
commonly used batch experiment method (Gilbert et al. 2014 ; Jubany et al. 2009 ). Floc 
and biofilm biomass pellets, obtained via centrifugation, were washed with phosphate -
buffered saline at least three times before being suspended in mineral medium containing 
target substrates ( i.e., NH 4+ and NO 2- for SAAB and NH 4+ for SAOB). Ideal anaerobic and 
aerobic conditions were maintained separately for SAAB and SAOB tests. The SAAB and 
SAOB were calculated as the ratio of maximum substrate consumption rate and biomass 
concent ration. All batch studies were performed in triplicate.  
8.3. Results  
8.3.1. Nitrogen removal performance  
Figure 8.1 shows the average ammonium and total nitrogen removal efficiencies achieved 
during each operating phase, while Figure B -8.1 (Appendix B) in  the Supplementary 
Information shows detailed dynamic measurements.  
As can be seen in Figure 8.1, from Phases I to II at an influent NH 4+-N of 826.8 ± 6.6 mg/L, 
the average removal efficiency of NH 4+-N decreased from 88.6 ± 1.4% to 81.5 ± 1.6% (p 
< 0.01), and the TN removal efficiency decreased from 79.3 ± 1.4% to 70.2 ± 2.1% (p < 
0.01). This could be attributed to the fact that the elevated nitrogen loading rate (NLR) ( i.e., 
from 0.33 ± 0.003 kg N/m3/d to 0.41 ± 0.003 kg N/m3/d) and the associated H RT reduction 
increased oxygen requirements by AOB.  180 
  
Figure 8.1.  Removal efficiency of NH 4+-N and total nitrogen during different operation 
phases. Error bars represent the standard deviation of samples.  
 
As a matter of fact, with the increase of bulk DO from 0.18 -0.20 to 0.22 -0.24 mg/L from 
Phase II -1 to Phase II -2, the NH 4+-N removal efficiency recovered from 81.5 ± 1.6% to 
87.2 ± 1.2% (p < 0.01), and the TN removal efficiency increased from 70.2 ± 2.1% to 76.1 
± 0.9% (p < 0.01).  
Similarly to the transi tion from Phase I to Phase II -1, when the HRT was further reduced 
from 2.0 days (Phase II) to 1.5 d (Phase III), the ammonium removal efficiency dropped 
from 87.2 ± 1.2% to 84.7 ± 0.8% (p < 0.01) in Phase III -1, with the TN removal efficiency 
decreasing fr om 76.1 ± 0.9% to 73.4 ± 1.2% (p < 0.01).  As DO was increased to 0.24 -0.28 
mg/L in Phase III -2, the ammonium removal efficiency recovered to 88.2 ± 0.9%, and the 
TN removal efficiency raised to 75.6 ± 1.2% (p<0.01).  
181 
 Finally, when the HRT was further redu ced to 1.2 d in Phase IV, the ammonium removal 
efficiency decreased to 84.7 ± 1.0% (p<0.01), while the TN removal efficiency decreased 
from 75.6 ± 1.2% to 72.7 ± 1.4% (p<0.01) in Phase IV -1. Remarkably, when DO was 
increased to 0.28 -0.35 mg/L in Phase IV -2 in an attempt to improve nitrogen removals, a 
significant accumulation of NO 2- was observed (see Appendix B Figure B -8.1), which led 
to a relevant decrease in the TN removal efficiency from 72.7 ± 1.4% to 66.3 ± 1.3% 
(p<0.01), although the NH 4+-N removal efficiency was recovered to 85.9 ± 2.6% (p = 0.08). 
This decrease in TN removal efficiency can be attributed to the oxygen inhibition on 
anammox responsible for NO 2- reduction.  
With regards to the effluent nitrogen species apart from NH 4+-N, the effluent NO 3--N 
concentration was less than 11% ( i.e., 7.0% -9.6%) of the influent NH 4+-N concentration, 
indicating the co -existence of heterotrophic denitrification, similar to reported studies 
(Yang et al. 2019a ). The degradation of soluble COD, which is shown in Figure B -8.2 
(Appendix B), increased significantly from 29.7 ± 4.6 % at an HRT of 2.5 d to 38.70 ± 4.8% 
at HRT of 1.2 d. This could be attributed to the increase in the oxygen concentration which 
sped up aerobic heterotrophic activity.  
 
Upon HRT change, a constant increase of the biofilm thickness was observed, which was 
measured as 145.6 ± 10.2 µm in Phase I, 171.6 ± 5.8 µm in Phase II, 184.6 ± 8.1 µm in 
Phase III and 214.2 ± 9.6 µm in Phase IV). In our study, biofilm thickness could be as well 
correlated with substrate removal rate, as shown in Figure 8.2. It is however in our case 
study more difficult to have an unbiased clear correlation between the two, as nitrogen 
removal rate does not exclusively depend on the biofilm biological act ivity but also on the 182 
 suspended biomass. By allowing the growth of AOB which consumes oxygen diffusing 
into the biofilm from the bulk, thicker biofilm may help to protect anammox bacteria from 
higher DO concentrations.

end of each phase.  
 
8.3.2. The specific activities of AOB and anammox bacteria  
Anammox bacteria and AOB dominated t he microbial populations in the system, and their 
specific activities, determined as explained in Section 2.4, are exhibited in Figure 8.3A and 
8.3B, respectively.

With the extended SRT, anammox bacteria dominated the biological activities i n the 
biofilm. Biofilm structure is known to exhibit a higher mass transfer resistance of substrates 
and DO, as compared to flocs (Zhang et al. 2015 ). As can be seen in Figure 8.3A, when the 
HRT was reduced from 2.5 d (Phase I) to 2.0 d (Phase II), biofilm SAAB changed from 
0.17 ± 0.01 mg N/mg VSS/d to 0.18 ± 0.01 mg N/mg VSS/d in Phase II -1 (p = 0.17) at DO 
of 0.18 -0.20 mg/L, and increased slightly to 0.20 ± 0.00 mg N/mg VSS/d (p = 0.025) when 
DO in Phase II was increased to 0.22 -0.24 mg /L in Phase II -2. When the HRT was further 
reduced to 1.5 d, biofilm SAAB further increased to 0.22 ± 0.00 mg N/mg VSS/d (p = 
0.007), but remained stable at 0.23±0.01 mg N/mg VSS/d with the higher DO of 0.24 -0.28 
mg/L (p = 0.055). Adjustments of DO levels enabled maintaining potential high AOB 
activity which provided anammox bacteria with a larger amount of NO 2- as nitrogen 
loading increased. This helped explain the slight increase of anammox activity from Phase 
I to Phase IV -1. However, the increase of DO levels to 0.28 -0.35 mg/L in Phase IV -2 made 
anammox activity drop significantly to 0.11 ± 0.03 mg N/mg VSS/d (p = 0.003), which 
consequently led to the aforementioned nitrite accumulation.  
A small portion of anammox bacteria inhabited the flocs . Floc SAAB  consistently dropped 
as a consequence of HRT reduction from Phase I to Phase IV (p = 0.12). Floc SAAB was 
measured at 0.12 ± 0.02 mg N/mg VSS/d and 0.10 ± 0.00 mg N/mg VSS/d (p = 0.17) in 185 
 Phases I and II, respectively, and significantly decreased to 0.07 ± 0.00 mg N/mg VSS/d 
(p = 0.00033) with the increased DO at a HRT of 2.0 d. This may be explained by the 
higher DO inhibition on anammox activity in the floc configuration, where less oxygen 
transfer limitation occurs due to the looser floc structure compa red to that of biofilm. The 
floc SAAB accounted for 11 -40% of the overall anammox activity, with a constant 
decrease from Phase I to Phase IV -2, as shown in Figure 8.3A. More anammox bacteria 
are retained in biofilm with the HRT reduction, which is consist ent with the conclusion of 
our previous study (Yang et al. 2019b ). The bulk DO raise further increased the retain 
ability of anammox bacteria wi thin biofilm, where a larger DO transfer resistance applies.  
As shown in Figure 8.3B, the specific activity of AOB (SAOB) in flocs was significantly 
higher than that of biofilm, as observed previously (Yang et al. 2019b ). This is because, 
contrarily to anammox bacteria, AOB growth is favored by oxygen. When the HRT was 
reduced from 2.5 d (Phase I) to 2.0 d (Phase II -1), floc SAOB remained stable at 0.27 ± 
0.014 mg N/mg VSS/d and 0.272 ± 0.012 mg N/mg VSS/d (p = 0.81), respectively, and 
increased significantly to 0.301 ± 0.004 mg N/mg VSS/d (p = 0.019) with an increase of 
DO in Phase II -2 (0.22 -0.24 mg L-1). The activity of AOB in the flocs increas ed with higher 
DO because of low resistance in DO accessibility from bulk liquid to the flocs. Similarly, 
the reduction of HRT to 1.5 d in Phase III -1 did not affect the flocs SAOB (0.303 ± 0.005 
mg N/mg VSS/d [p = 0.6]). However, it increased to 0.325 ± 0 .007 mg N/mg VSS/d (p = 
0.009) with an increase of DO in Phase III -2 (0.24 -0.28 mg/L). When the HRT was further 
reduced from 1.5 d to 1.2 d in Phase IV -1, the floc SAOB was stable at 0.331 ± 0.010 mg 
N/mg VSS/d (p = 0.29) and further increased to 0.412 ± 0 .012 mg N/mg VSS/d (p = 0.0008) 186 
 with an increase of DO. AOB within flocs exhibited greater sensitivity to changes in bulk 
DO concentration than to changes in the NLR.  
The change of biofilm SAOB followed the same pattern in the operation as that in the flocs . 
The contribution of SAOB in flocs account for 78 -88% in the overall S AOB of reactor, 
indicating a successful segregation of AOB and anammox bacteria in the IFAS type reactor.  
8.3.3. Biomass  
Monitoring reactor biomass is important because longer biomass retention times are 
necessary for the slow growth of anammox bacteria and monitoring the biomass changes 
at different operational phases can give us valuable information related with its removal 
performance. Figure 8.4 shows the biomass mass as biofilm and as flocs during the 
different operating phases. Under the well -mainta ined SRT throughout the entire 
operational period, floc biomass concentrations were impacted only slightly by the change 
of operating conditions. For instance, floc biomass increased significantly from 4.28 ± 0.26 
mg VSS to 5.02 ± 0.33 mg VSS (p = 0.025) w hen the HRT was reduced from 2.5 d in 
Phase I to 2.0 d in Phase II -1 and became stable in Phase II -2 at 5.17 ± 0.28 mg VSS/L (p 
= 0.15) with the increase of DO. This is consistent with the observation in other flocs  
systems which indicated the increased in fluent loading encouraged the biomass growth 
(Sheng et al. 2016 ; Xu et al. 2018b ). Flocculent biomass overall keeps increasing with 
higher nitrogen loading rate and higher oxygen concentrations throughout the operational 
period.  187 
  
Figure 8.4.  The biomass of biofilm (left column) and floc (right column) during different 
phases.  
 
The biofilm biomass was slightly higher than that of the flocs , due to the superior retention 
of biomass in the biocarriers. Both the decrease of HRT and increase of DO  led to an 
increase (p < 0.05) of biofilm biomass along with the operation (from 5.9 ± 0.4 g VSS in 
Phase I to 9.9 ± 0.6 g VSS in Phase IV), mainly due to the growth of AOB and anammox 
bacteria in the biofilm, as observed previously (Yang et al. 2019b ). The increased biomass 
at a lower HRT may explain the higher DO requirement when considering the fixed DO 
mass transfer rate. As reported in the study by (Wang et al. 2019 ), DO concentration in the 
inner biofilm layers is lower than that of the bulk solution because of the accessibility 
limitation, thus higher DO may be required to maintain the similar DO level in biofilm 
when the biofilm thickness or density increase.  
8.3.4. Microbial analysis  
188 
 Figure 8.5 shows 16S rRNA gene abundance of anammox bacteria, AOB, NOB, and 
heterotrophic denitrifiers in biofilm (A) and flocs (B). The qPCR (targeting anammox nirS 
gene) results showed that the biofilm anammox population increased from (4.13 ± 0.09) 
×107 to (4.46 ± 0.09) × 107 gene copies/mg VSS biomass (p = 0.02) from Phase I to II -2, 
respectively, and further increased to (5.55 ± 0.09) ×107 gene copies/mg VSS biom ass (p 
= 0.0002) from Phase II -2 to III -2. It then decreased to (4.2 ± 0.06) ×107 gene copies/mg 
VSS biomass (p < 0.0001) from Phase III -2 to IV -1, and finally decreased to (1.02 ± 0.1) 
×107 gene copies/mg VSS biomass (p < 0.0001) in Phase IV -2. The floc a nammox bacteria 
population were relatively stable in Phases I -III, measuring (4.14 ± 0.16) ×106, (3.98 ± 0.13) 
×106, and (3.57 ± 0.3) ×106 gene copies/mg VSS biomass (p = 0.26 and 0.07), respectively. 
From Phase III to IV, the floc anammox bacteria populat ion decreased to (2.78 ± 0.1) ×106 
gene copies/mg VSS biomass (p = 0.009) in Phase IV -1 and to (1.35 ± 0.4) ×106 gene 
copies/mg VSS biomass (p = 0.003) in Phase IV -2. The change of anammox bacteria in 
both biofilm and floc configuration at each phase corre lated well with corresponding 
SAAB results. From Phase I to Phase III -2 (i.e., from HRT of 2.5 d to 1.5 d) the increase 
of anammox bacteria population in biofilm was continuously observed, but in flocs  
anammox population constantly decreased. It is worth t o point out that the presence of 
anammox in the flocs is a result of different contribution such as biofilm detachment, 
settling and operating conditions such as oxygen. In general, anammox bacteria in flocs are 
more affected by higher oxygen concentration  which, as previously reported, is increased 
from Phase I to Phase IV. The results suggest that when oxygen increased moderately, 
namely from Phase I to III, anammox bacteria tend to build up more in the biofilm than in 189 
 the bulk. However, when oxygen conce ntration is increased above the threshold of 0.28 
mg/L, also the anammox bacteria in the biofilm get affected.

A 190 
 The qPCR results targeting the amoA gene indicated flocculent AOB population was 
significantly higher than biofilm AOB. In the bulk, AOB population increased slightly from 
(2.26 ± 0.3) × 107 gene copies/mg VSS biomass in Phase I to (2.90 ± 0.5) × 107 gene 
copies/mg VSS biomass in Phases II -2, and  then significantly increased to (5.88 ± 0.3) × 
107 gene copies/mg VSS biomass (p = 0.001) in Phase III -2. In Phase IV -1, the floc AOB 
population increased further to (6.69 ± 0.6) × 107 gene copies/mg VSS biomass, to (7.57 ± 
0.7) × 107 gene copies/mg VSS b iomass in Phase IV -2. These results demonstrate that AOB 
population increases with the increase of their substrate in the feeding, provided oxygen is 
supplied in a sufficient amount. As for the difference in the AOB qPCR results between 
Phase IV -1 and Phas e IV-2, it could be that the oxygen inhibition on anammox made more 
ammonium available for AOB, leading to their augmentation.  
Biofilm AOB increased continuously from Phase I to Phase IV -1, with populations of (9.73 
± 0.7) × 106, (1.20 ± 0.1) × 107 (p < 0 .05), (1.65 ± 0.08)×107 (p = 0.007), and (1.96 ± 0.2) 
× 107 (p = 0.04) gene copies/mg VSS biomass in Phases I, II -2, III -2, and IV -1, respectively.  
The qPCR results (targeting NSR gene) demonstrated that the population of NOB  were 
considerably sparse comp ared to the population of AOB, anammox bacteria, and the 
detected heterotrophic denitrifiers. The population of Nitrospira  were also relatively stable 
with the change of operation conditions, which were (1.38 ± 0.4) × 105 ~(2.48 ± 0.2) × 105 
and (1.97 ± 0. 4) × 105 ~(3.60 ± 0.17) × 105 gene copies/mg VSS biomass in biofilm and 
flocs , respectively. By applying intermittent aeration, NOB are easily outcompeted by 
AOB as NOB need a longer time to recover from the non -aeration period (Li et al. 2011 ), 
or are inhibited by the NH 2OH that is likely produced in the intermittent aeration process 
(Trojanowicz et al. 2019 ).  191 
 Heterotrophic denitrifiers were measured by qPCR targeting both nosZ  gene and narG  gene, 
which were extensively studied for the heterotr ophic denitrifier detection (Yang et al. 
2019b ). From Figure 8.5 the activity of heterotrophic denitrifiers can be observed to be 
considerably l ower than that of anammox bacteria, indicating heterotrophic denitrifiers 
were not dominant in the reactor. This can be attributed to the low available biodegradable 
carbon source, and has been widely observed in the low C/N prevailing reactors (Veuillet 
et al. 2014 ; Yang et al. 2019b ).  
The increase of NO 2- along with the decrease of NO 3- in the Phase IV -2 clearly indicate the 
scarce abundance of NOB in the system, which has been reported previously for such 
intermittently aerated systems (Li et al. 2011 ). As a matter of  fact, if NOB presence were 
relevant, the AOB -produced NO 2- would be converted into NO 3- instead of accumulating. 
The presence of NO 2- was associated to an accumulation of FNA in the system, which were 
detected in the range of 1.4 ± 1.0 μg/L - 2.4 μg/L in P hase I to IV -1, until increased to 21.7 
± 4.1 μg/L in Phase IV -2. The FNA concentration in Phase IV -2 is beyond the reported 
FNA inhibition thresholds ( i.e., 5.9-19.8 μg/L) on anammox bacteria (Jin et al. 2012 ).   
As can be observed from this experience, being HRT the same  (namely, within the same 
phase), oxygen concentration in the bulk needs to be raised in order to increase ammonium 
nitrogen removal. Furthermore, as HRT decreases, oxygen set point must be increased. 
However, it can be noted that when HRT is too small (1. 2 days), the required oxygen 
concentration needed in order to improve ammonium removal efficiency inhibits anammox 
bacteria and this in turn worsens total nitrogen removal efficiency. Our study shows that 
0.28 mg/L is the threshold bulk oxygen concentratio n above which anammox inhibition 
starts taking place. Other studies found higher oxygen values at which anammox bacteria 192 
 are strongly inhibited. For instance, Kalvelage et al. (2011 ) reported anammox activity 
being comp letely inhibited at DO of 0.64 mg/L. However, the threshold oxygen 
concentration depends on several other operational features among which biofilm thickness 
and density, mixing regime, coexistence with AOB in the biofilm and oxygen diffusivity.  
In additio n to the inhibitory effect of DO, in long term the accumulation of FNA in the 
system due to the absence of NOB can be considered responsible for further anammox 
activity drops.  
Furthermore, the feasibility of using intermittent aeration to maintain a rela tively stabilized 
anammox activity and suppress NOB activity was demonstrated. This is because the non -
aeration period provides favorable conditions for the growth of anammox bacteria in both 
flocs and biofilm. Although the NH 4+ and the AOB -produced NO 2- can be oxidized either 
during aeration stage or non -aeration stage in this study thanks to the oxygen transfer 
limitations in the biofilm, it was observed that the NO 2- utilization rate during non -aeration 
stage was 2.2 times higher than that during aeratio n stage (P < 0.01) indicating that non -
aeration enhanced the activity of anammox bacteria. Furthermore, thanks to the non -
aerated periods NOB was more easily outcompeted even under a relatively high DO 
concentration of 0.35 mg/L indicating. In the study by  Brockmann and Morgenroth (2010 ), 
the activity of NOB bacteria was recovered slowly after 110 days of stabilized operation in 
a nitritation system under continuous aeration conditions. On the contrary, in this study the 
specific activities of NOB bacteria were always kept low (0.012 ± 0. 001 - 0.015 ± 0.002 
mg N/mg VSS/d in the biofilm 0.022 ± 0.005 - 0.028 ± 0.004 mg N/mg VSS/d in the flocs ). 
8.4. Conclusions  193 
 The present work shows how to regulate oxygenation regime of IFAS -continuous operation 
nitritation -anammox systems at different nitrogen loading rates. It was found that higher 
DO concentrations need to be established in order to maintain high total nitrog en removal 
efficiency at increased nitrogen loading rates. However, this cannot be done endlessly. As 
a matter of fact, when DO concentration is higher than 0.28 mg/L, inhibition on anammox 
bacteria starts taking place due to increased oxygen concentration s in the biofilm. In 
escalation, if no NOB are present in the system, the AOB -produced nitrite starts 
accumulating and this in turn can further compromise anammox bacteria activity via free 
nitrous acid inhibition.  
From this experience, it can be observed  that at nitrogen loading rates equal or higher than 
0.69 kg N/m3/day, alternative ways of maintaining high TN removal efficiencies – other 
than increasing DO concentration - should be identified.  
In addition, the present study confirms the use of intermi tted aeration as a strategy to 
effectively avoid NOB growth.  
Finally, knowing the maximal nitrogen loading rate at which an IFAS one -stage partial 
nitritation/anammox system can work is crucial when identifying the ideal reactor volumes 
for larger scales.

 CHAPT ER 9 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION OF 
NITRITATION -ANAMMOX PROCESS FOR AUTOTROPHIC NITROGEN 
REMOVAL IN DIFFERENT REACTOR CONFIGURATION: A STUDY FOR 
THE TREATMENT OF AMMONIA -RICH LAGOON SUPERNATANT  
9.1. Introduction  
Technologies for treating high -amm onia, dewatered -sludge return -flow separately prior to 
blending with the main sewage treatment train are urgently needed to meet stringent 
nitrogen removal effluent standards. Compared with conventional biological nitrogen 
removal processes, the anammox pr ocess has many advantages, i.e., low oxygen demand, 
low excess sludge, reduced CO 2 emissions, and no requirement for external carbon sources 
(Van Hulle et al., 2010 ). Thus, the anammox process is a p romising technology for 
ammonia -rich sludge -liquor treatment.  
The nitritation -anammox process can be configured as either a one -stage or two -stage 
configuration. One -stage configurations include: DEMON (Deammonification) (Wett et 
al., 2015 ), OLAND (oxygen limited autotr ophic nitrification denitrification) (Schaubroeck 
et al., 2012 ), CANON (completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite) (Vázquez -
Padín et al., 2009 ), and SNAP (single -stage nitrogen removal using anammox and 
nitritation) (Zhang et al., 2014 ). Two -stage configurations include Sharon -Anammox 
(single reactor high activity ammonia removal over nitr ite-anaerobic ammonium oxidation) 
(Hwang et al., 2005 ).  
Various operational conditions may be applied for ammonia reduction. Previous studies 
have demonstrated that oxidation –reduction potential (OR P) (Lackner et al., 2012 ), oxygen 198 
 transfer rate (OTR) (Akaboci et al., 2018 ) and online NH 4+ signal (Joss et al., 2011 ) are all 
important process control parameters. Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in 
reacto r configuration and operational conditions can significantly impact reactor 
performance (Tao et al., 2012 ).  The aim of the present work was to summarize these 
published studies and compare the nitrogen removal treatment performance and microbial 
communities between bioreactors operating under various configurations and operatio nal 
conditions. Operational strategies that can enhance treatment effectively and stability have 
been identified and discussed.

0.54 ± 0.01 and 0.46 ± 0.01 kg N m-3 d-1, respectively. The advantage of anammox IFAS 
configuration (2nd stage of two -stage PN/A reactor) is that anammox bacteria activities are 
most robust due to the favorable conditions provided by the separated reactor system (Yang 
et al., 2019a ) (see Chapter 3). For the two -stage reactor, biodegradable COD in th e raw 
wastewater can be utilized by the 1st stage of the nitritation reactor and thus reduce the 200 
 competition with heterotrophs for the NO 2- substrates. The nitritation and anammox 
processes are separated and offer a wider range of optimal process condition s than in a one -
stage system. However, NO 2- can easily accumulate, especially at high loading rates (Yang 
et al., 2019d ) (see Chapter 4). In the one -stage systems ( i.e., IFAS or continuous operation 
configurations), NO 2- was consumed and produced simultaneously and there was no NO 2- 
accumulation (Yang et al., 2019c ) (see Chapter 6). Under DO conditions, anammox 
bacteria can be protected by the inner layer of biofilm. Therefore, the process -design 
considerations should be based on expected operating. For example, if anammox activities 
are low during the start -up period, a two -stage reactor is recommended. If anammox 
activities become stable and active, switching to one -stage operation is an appropriate 
option.  
9.3.2. IFAS vs. MBBR  
In order to evaluate the  impacts of MBBR and IFAS on the nitrogen removal efficiency, 
MBBR and IFAS modes were applied in Chapter 7 (Yang et al., 2020 ). Results showed 
that when the MBBR operation was switched into the IFAS operation, where the flocs 
biomass increased, the NRR increased 2 -times. The activity of AOB in the flocs was much 
higher than that in the biofilm due to the diffusion limitation ( e.g. dissolved oxygen and 
substrates) to the biofilm. Results showed that AOB population was significantly improved 
because of the returned settling sludge back into the reacto r system.  
9.3.3. Aeration strategies  
Both continuous and intermittent aeration were compared in the one -stage nitritation -
anammox process in Chapter 7 (Yang et al., 2020 ). Study showed that NOB was effectively 201 
 inhibited under 0.20 mg L-1 of DO condition. However, study indicted that the NOB 
activity would  recover with the long term operation under continuous aeration condition 
(Jianlong and Ning, 2004 ). Results showed that by applying intermittent aeration, NOB 
activity remained low during different stages. Furthermore, the enhancemen t of anammox 
bacteria activity was proved when non -aeration stage was applied.  
The anammox activity was significantly enhanced.  
9.3.4. Continuous operation vs. SBR  
SBR operation ensures a long retention time of bacteria effectively growing in the reactor . 
It was proven that anammox activity was significantly improved at a higher substrate 
loading rates in Chapter 4 and Chapter 6 (Yang et al., 2019c ; Yang et al., 2019d ). 
Continuous flow operation can reduce the high subst rate loading shocks. A shorter SRT 
has the advantage of selecting AOB growth while suppressing NOB growth. Our results 
indicate that the NRR during SBR and continuous operation operations were stabilized at 
0.54 ± 0.01 and 0.26 ± 0.005 kg N m-3 d-1, respectively.  
9.3.5. Microbial community comparison  
Among the three reactor configurations, the amount of AMX nirS in biofilm was highest 
(P < 0.05), at 6.85×107 copies mg-1 VSS biomass in the anammox IFAS configuration. On 
the other hand, anammox popul ation in the flocs remained low at different stages indicting 
that the anammox activity was more prevalent in the biofilm versus the flocs , regardless of 
reactor configuration ( i.e., one -stage reactor vs two -stage reactor). The following are our 
recommende d ways to improve the abundance of anammox bacteria, preceded by the 
rationale. (1) Higher abundances of nutrients improved the growth of bacteria (AOB and 202 
 anammox bacteria. In Yang et al. (2019d ) of Chapter 4, the decrease in HRT from 2.5 to 
1.7 day resulted in 1.9 -times increase in the anammox population. (2) In Yang et al. (2019d ) 
of Chapter 4, results showed that after swit ching to step -feeding mode, the population of 
anammox bacteria increased from 4.9×107 to 6.1×107 copies mg-1 VSS biomass in biofilm. 
Thus, it is recommended that step feed mode in SBR operation can be applied for 
preventing high influent NO 2- inhibition. ( 3) In Yang et al. (2020 ) of Chapter 7,  the 
abundance of AMX nirS in biofilm improved effectively after switching to intermittent 
aeration. Thus, it is recommended that intermittent aeration can be applied for maintaining 
anammox bacteria activity active. (4) Anammox population can be affected by different 
DO concentrations. In chapter 8, the qPCR (targeting AMX nirS gene) the biofilm 
anammox population decreased from 4.13 ×107 to 1.02 ×107 gene copies mg-1 VSS biomass 
(P < 0.01) when the DO was increased from 0.24 - 0.28 mg L-1 to DO of 0.28 - 0.35 mg L-
1, respectively. Thus, it is recommended that DO concentration in one -stage should not 
exceed 0.28 mg L-1 to prevent the inhibition impact on the anammox ba cteria.  
The qPCR results show that the AOB population was much higher in the flocs  than in the 
biofilm. In order to enhance the overall AOB population, it is recommended that the flocs 
should be kept in one stage operation system. For example, in Chapter 7, the AOB 
population in the flocs improved significantly by IFAS mode. Further, a higher DO 
concentration has been shown to improve the growth rate of AOB; in Chapter 8, the AOB 
population was highest (7.57 × 107 gene copies/mg VSS biomass) at a DO of 0.2 8 - 0.35 
mg/L.  
NOB was suppressed under all operation conditions, as shown by the low NOB populations. 
This indicates that a low NOB population can be ensured by (1) applying intermittent 203 
 aeration (Chapter 7), (2) keeping low DO (lower than 0.28 mg L-1) (Chapter 8), and (3) 
high free ammonia inhibition (Chapter 6).  
9.3.6. Operational recommendations  
(1) The start -up time for anammox bacteria can be long (1 -2 years) due to its extremely 
low growth rate, therefore, an anammox IFAS configuration is recommended  for the start -
up phase. After the anammox activity builds up by introducing the nitritation sludge into 
anammox IFAS configuration, the one -stage nitritation -anammox configuration can be 
feasible and reliable. (2) Online monitoring of NO 2- and O 2 concentr ations are necessary 
for achieving a stabilized nitrogen removal efficiency. Since anammox can be inhibited by 
the high accumulation of NO 2- (above 125 - 150 mg N L-1) and DO (above 0.35 mg L-1) in 
the bulk liquid, monitoring can provide reliable informati on to run nitritation -anammox 
system, and operational adjustments can be made accordingly when NO 2- accumulates or 
high/low DO concentration are present in the bulk liquid. (3) During operations, SAA and 
SAOB tests are highly recommended since maintaining active anammox activity and AOB 
activity are crucial. Relying on online probes and MLSS measurements are not usually 
accurate because such measurements may not provide a good correlation with bacteria 
activity. The best solution to get accurate information  is to measure the activities of AOB 
and anammox bacteria in batch tests.  
9.4. Conclusion  
1. The anammox IFAS was successfully established. Anammox activity was improved 
when HRT was reduced from 2.5 day to 1.7 day. At HRT of 1.2 day, it was found that th e 
anammox activity was inhibited because of high nitrite accumulation especially in the 204 
 beginning of feed phase per SBR cycle. The impact of NO 2- inhibition was reduced by 
applying step -feed strategy. The anammox IFAS configuration achieved the highest NRR  
(0.61 ± 0.02 kg N m-3 d-1) and anammox activity (0.38 ± 0.05 kg N kg VSS-1 d-1). Microbial 
activities and community compositions showed that anammox bacteria dominated in the 
biofilm while heterotrophs mainly stayed in the flocs .  
2. The anammox activity significantly improved when a phosphorus concentration reduced 
from 235 ± 15.4 mg PO 43-P L−1 to 32 ± 5.4 mg PO 43-P L−1. Batch study indicated that the 
anammox bacteria in the biofilm showed greater tolerance when facing higher phosphate 
concentration conditions than anammox bacteria in the flocs . Result demonstrates that 
nitrogen removal efficiency can be significantly im proved on treating ammonia rich lagoon 
supernatant once PO 43- is precipitated during the Ostara® process as pre -treatment.  
3. In the nitritation -anammox configuration, by reducing HRTs from 2.5 day to 1.2 day and 
increasing biocarrier filling ratio from 35 % to 55%, the nitrogen removal rates (NRR) was 
significantly improved. SBR operation have higher NRR (0.54 ± 0.01 kg N m-3 d-1) and 
anammox activity (0.33 ± 0.02 kg N kg VSS-1 d-1) than continuous operation operation at 
an HRT of 1.2 day.  
4. By applying intermittent aeration and introduction of returned sludge into system, 
continuous operation configuration can reach a maximum NRR (0.46 ± 0.01 kg N m-3 d-1) 
and anammox activity (0.23 ± 0.01 kg N m-3 d-1), which can make up for the disadvantages 
of continuous operation configuration operation.  
5. The impact of different DO concentrations on the nitrogen removal efficiency in one -
stage continuous operation nitritation -anammox was also investigated. Results suggested 205 
 that AOB activity was significan tly improved when DO increased from 0.18 to 0.35 mg L-
1. However, when DO concentration was higher than 0.28 mg/L, NO 2- concentration began 
to accumulate and inhibition on anammox bacteria occurred indicting that the optimal DO 
range in our study should be  from 0.30 to 0.35 mg L-1.

 CHAPTER 10. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
10.1. Conclusions  
Conclusions derived from research described in chapters 3 - 9 are reported below:  
This lab -scale study showed that applications for lagoon supernatant treatment are 
achievable by applying nitritation -anammox process, either by one -stage or two -stage 
operation. Under optimized conditions, the anammox IFAS configuration achieved the 
highest NRR (0.61 ± 0.02 kg N m-3 d-1) and anammox activity (0.38 ± 0.05 kg N kg VSS-
1 d-1) at an HRT of 1.2 day. The anammox activity were 2 -times higher in the anamm ox 
IFAS configuration than in the one -stage nitritation -anammox operation.  
For the nitritation -anammox configuration, SBR operation have higher NRR (0.54 ± 0.01 
kg N m-3 d-1) and anammox activity (0.33 ± 0.02 kg N kg VSS-1 d-1) than CSTR operation 
at an H RT of 1.2 day. The operation of the SBR configuration achieved 1.4 -times higher 
anammox activity than the CSTR configuration. As compared to the MBBR configuration 
(with no flocs ), the IFAS configuration significantly enhanced reactor performance in one -
stage nitritation -anammox operation.  Further, intermittent aeration resulted in 1.5 -times 
higher SAA compared with continuous aeration. DO concentration in mixed liquor needs 
to be continuous monitored and adjusted to maintain high AOB activities, and thus overall 
NRR. After optimization, CSTR configuration can reach a maximum NRR (0.46 ± 0.01 kg 
N m-3 d-1) and anammox activity (0.23 ± 0.01 kg N m-3 d-1) by applying intermittent 
aeration and introduction of returned sludge into system, which can make up for the 
disadvantages of CSTR configuration operation.  209 
 Among all operation parameters tested, the most significant improvements in NRR were 
observed when (i) aeration was switched from continuous to intermittent; (ii) continuous 
DO adjustment as biomass devel ops, and (iii) maintaining suspended biomass (as in one -
stage CSTR reactor).  
10.2. Recommendations for further studies  
1. Nitrous oxide (N 2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and long -term exposure to N 2O in a work 
environment may cause long -term complications. N 2O can be formed during biological 
treatment processes. AOB denitrification and incomplete heterotrophs denitrification are 
two main pathways. For the side stream treatment, further studies are recommended to 
identify N 2O produced pathways and emissions. Most importantly, studies should focus on 
how to mitigate N 2O emissions under various operation conditions.  
2. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the operation and maintenance cost of 
nitritation -anammox process for treating side s tream wastewater  
3. Feasibility of nitritation -anammox process in a pilot scale is recommended.  
4. Further studies are recommended to determine the removal efficiency at lower 
temperatures for two -stage or one -stage nitritation -anammox process on treating  side 
stream wastewater.  
5. Compared with the traditional nitrification -denitrification process, nitritation -anammox 
process is a cost -efficiency technology. Mainstream wastewater treatment with low 
ammonia nitrogen loading will be a challenge by applying  nitritation -anammox process. 
The study on the low strength nitrogen wastewater are recommended.  210
