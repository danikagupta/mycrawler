Bio-remediation;Ligninolytic enzymesAbstract An indigenously isolated white rot fungus, Schizophyllum commune IBL-06 was used to
decolorize Solar brilliant red 80 direct dye in Kirk’s basal salts medium. In initial screening study,
the maximum decolorization (84.8%) of Solar brilliant red 80 was achieved in 7 days shaking incu-bation period at pH 4.5 and 30 /C176C. Different physical and nutritional factors including pH, temper-
ature and fungal inoculum density were statistically optimized through Completely Randomized
Design (CRD), to enhance the efﬁciency of S. commune IBL-06 for maximum decolorization of
Solar brilliant red 80 dye. The effects of inexpensive carbon and nitrogen sources were also inves-tigated. Percent dye decolorization was determined by a reduction in optical density at the wave-
length of maximum absorbance ( k
max, 590 nm). Under optimum conditions, the S. commune
IBL-06 completely decolorized (100%) the Solar brilliant red 80 dye using maltose and ammoniumsulfate as inexpensive carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively in 3 days. S. commune IBL-06 pro-
duced the three major ligninolytic enzymes lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganase peroxidase (MnP)
and lacaase (Lac) during the decolorization of Solar brilliant red 80. LiP was the major enzyme(944 U/mL) secreted by S. commune IBL-06 along with comparatively lower activities of MnP
and Laccase.

1. Introduction
Synthetic dyes are one among the major chemical pollutants
that originate mainly from textile and plastic industries and
pose serious health hazards to the entire ecosystem, especially
the animals and human beings. These dyes are unusually resis-tant to degradation and decolorization by physical or chemical
methods including adsorption, precipitation, chemical degra-
dation or photo degradation. The physio-chemical remedia-tion techniques also have ﬁnancial and methodologicaldisadvantages ( Ali and El-Mohamedy, 2012; Asgher and*Corresponding author. Tel.: +92 419200161/3312.

provided by Elsevier - Publisher Connector Iqbal, 2013 ). There is a pressing need for development of eco-
friendly biological treatment techniques for such dyes and tex-tile dye containing efﬂuents. A number of reports are available
in literature on bioremediation of dyes by micro-organisms
that have dye degrading capabilities ( Chen, 2006; Asgher
et al., 2008, 2009, 2012a,b,c; Oves et al., 2013 ). Biological pro-
cesses provide an alternative to existing expensive and com-
mercially or environmentally unattractive, physio-chemicaltechnologies. The biological treatment is cost effective and
eco-friendly, and can be applied to wide range of dyes or dye
containing industrial efﬂuents ( Senthilkumar et al., in press;
Iqbal and Asgher, 2013 ).
A wide spectrum of microorganisms including bacteria, ﬁl-
amentous white rot fungi, yeasts and algae are capable of
decolorizing a wide range of dyes via anaerobic, aerobic andsequential anaerobic–aerobic treatment processes ( Martins
et al., 1999; Asgher et al., 2012d ). Anaerobic systems could re-
duce the color intensity more satisfactorily than the aerobicprocesses. However, the carcinogenic aromatic amines formed
with reductive cleavage of azo bonds by bacterial azoreductase
need to be further decomposed by an aerobic treatment(Pearce et al., 2003 ). WRF have the potential capability to aer-
obically degrade such contaminants by virtue of its extracellu-
lar ligninolytic enzymes ( Asgher et al., 2008; Iqbal and Asgher,
2013). Individual azo-, triphenylmethane-, phthalocyanine and
heterocyclic dyes ( Tavcˇar et al., 2006 ), as well as complex
industrial efﬂuents are efﬁciently decolorized by the action of
nonspeciﬁc ligninolytic enzymes of WRF ( U¨nyayar et al.,
2005; Asgher et al., 2008, 2012c; Senthilkumar et al., in press ).
In recent years many efforts have been made for the devel-
opment of bioremediation processes using white rot fungi. Thecurrent study was focused on the development and optimiza-
tion of bioremediation process for Solar brilliant red 80 direct
textile dye by S. commune IBL-06.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and textile dyestuff
The direct textile dye Solar brilliant red 80 used in this study
was obtained from Clariant Pakistan Limited, Faisalabad.The chemical structure of Solar brilliant red 80 is shown in
Fig. 1 . All other chemicals were of analytical grade and werepurchased from Sigma–Aldrich Chemicals (USA) and Merck
(Germany).
2.2. Fungal culture and spore inoculum preparation
Pure culture of locally isolated indigenous white rot fungus S.
commune IBL-06 was obtained from Industrial Biotechnology
Laboratory, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Uni-
versity of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. The culture wasinitially grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium slants
at pH 4.5 and 30 /C176C. After having sufﬁcient population of
spores, the PDA slants were refrigerated for subsequent usein further experimental studies. Inoculum medium was pre-
pared by adding 1% (w/v) sterile glucose solution to the Kirk’s
basal salts medium ( Tien and Kirk, 1988 ). Fresh culture of S.
commune IBL-06 was added to the inoculum medium and the
ﬂask was incubated (120 rpm) at 30 /C176C for 5 days to get a
homogenous inoculum (1 ·10
6–108spores/mL).
2.3. Fermentation protocol for decolorization
Decolorization ﬂasks (500 mL) were prepared in triplicate each
containing 100 mL of 0.01% (w/v) Solar brilliant red 80 dyesolution in Kirk’s nutrient medium (pH 4.5).The ﬂasks were
sterilized in autoclave (121 /C176C) for 15 min. and on cooling to
room temperature, 5 mL inoculum was aseptically added toeach ﬂask in laminar air ﬂow under sterilized environment.In the initial time course study, experimental samples were
incubated for 10 days at 120 rpm in a temperature controlled
shaking incubator. The triplicate ﬂasks were removed afterevery 24 h and the contents were ﬁltered through Watman
No. 1 ﬁlter paper. After centrifugation, the supernatants were
collected and analyzed for residual dyestuff concentration.
2.4. Decolorization process optimization
The decolorization process was optimized by studying the effect
of different physical and nutritional factors on decolorization of
Solar brilliant red 80 by S. commune IBL-06. The classical meth-
od under Completely Randomized Design (CRD) for mediumoptimization was followed where one parameter was variedkeeping the previously optimized at optimum level.
2.4.1. Effect of pH
pH is an important physical factor that needs proper consider-
ation during microbial process optimization studies. The pH of
the decolorization media was adjusted at different levels (3,3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0) using M HCl/M NaOH. Aftersterilization each ﬂask was inoculated and incubated for stipu-
lated time period.
2.4.2. Effect of temperature
To study the effect of varying temperature on dye decoloriza-
tion efﬁciency of the fungus, the media were adjusted to initialoptimum pH 4 and incubated at 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 /C176C for
10 days. Samples harvested after every 24 h were spectropho-
tometricaly analyzed for residual dyestuff concentration.
2.4.3. Effect of carbon and nitrogen sources
The effects of inexpensive carbon supplements (glucose,
maltose, sucrose, fructose, and starch), and different nitrogen
Figure 1 Chemical Structure of Solar brilliant red 80 direct
textile dye.348 M. Asgher et al.additives (0.02% ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate,
ammonium di-hydrogen phosphate, peptone, and urea) wasalso investigated to select the best combination of carbon
and nitrogen source for optimum dye decolorization at opti-
mum pH and temperature.
2.4.4. Effect of inoculum size
For optimization of inoculum size, Kirk’s basal medium con-
taining Solar brilliant red 80 was inoculated with varying vol-umes (1–7 mL) of freshly prepared fungal spore inoculum.
After inoculation, all the ﬂasks were incubated under continu-
ous shaking conditions (120 rpm) for 10 days at optimum pHand temperature.
2.5. Decolorization assay
Solar brilliant red 80 solution was scanned in the wavelength
range from 200–800 nm using UV/Vis spectrophotometer (T60,
UV/Visible, PG Instruments, UK) to determine the wavelengthof maximum absorbance ( k
max588 nm). The collected ﬁltrates
from decolorization ﬂasks were carefully centrifuged at 5000 g
for 15 min at 4 /C176C and clear supernatants were analyzed spectro-
photometrically at 588 nm to determine the percent decoloriza-tion of Solar brilliant red 80 using the following formula:
%Decolorization ¼100/C2Aini/C0Afin
Aini
where, Aini= Initial absorbance of dye before incubation,
Aﬁn= Final absorbance of dye after incubation
2.6. Ligninolytic enzymes assays
Supernatants from optimally decolorized dye samples were
analyzed for LiP, MnP and Lac activities to study the enzymessecreted by the S. commune IBL-06 during decolorization of So-
lar brilliant red 80. LiP was assayed by the method of Tien and
Kirk (1988) . To determine the activity of MnP, the method of
Wariishi et al. (1992) was followed. Laccase activity of culture
supernatants was measured by monitoring the oxidation of 2, 2
azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6 sulphonate (ABTS) at
436 nm as described eariler ( Iqbal et al., 2011 ). Blanks con-
tained 100 lL of distilled water instead of culture supernatants.
2.7. Statistical analysis
All the data on dye decolorization and enzyme assays was sta-
tistically analyzed using the statistical software Minitab, Win-
dows version 15. The means and standard errors of means
(S.E) were calculated for each treatment. The SE values havebeen displayed as Y-error bars in ﬁgures.
3. Results and discussion
In the time course study on decolorization of Solar brilliant
red 80, S. commune IBL-06 showed maximum decolorization
(84.83%) on 7th day of incubation at pH 4.5 and 30 /C176C
(Fig. 2 ). The rate of color removal kept on increasing within
ﬁrst 7 days and no further decolorization occurred from 7 to
10 days. All the three ligninolytic enzymes including LiP,MnP, and Lac were secreted by S. commune IBL-06 that are
mainly involved in the decolorization process. LiP (507 U/mL) was the major enzyme recorded in the culture, followed
by MnP and laccase ( Fig. 2 ). The capability of WRF to com-
pletely/partially degrade or decolorize different textile dyes is
directly correlated to their ability to produce ligninolytic en-zyme when cultured in the dye containing medium. Similar
ﬁndings on co-relationship between ligninolytic enzymes and
textile dyes decolorization has also been observed by Zille
et al. (2004) . It has also been reported that dye concentration
also affects dye degradation by WRF and their ligninolytic en-
zymes ( Levin et al., 2012 ). The results demonstrate that
S. commune belong to several known white rot fungal species,
i.e.Trametes versicolor ,Phanerochaete chrysosporium ,Irpex
lacteus ,Pleurotus ostreatus andBjerkandera sp., that are capa-
ble of efﬁcient decolorization/degradation of a broad spectrumof chemically different textile dyes ( Novotny ´et al., 2001 ).
3.1. Effect of pH on dye decolorization
UV–Visible spectra and pH versus dye decolorization proﬁle
(Figs. 3 and 4 ) showed maximum dye decolorization efﬁciency

commune IBL-06.Enhanced decolorization of Solar brilliant red 80 349(87.70%) after 6 days of incubation in the medium adjusted at
pH 4. The culture supernatant of the media processed at vary-
ing pH showed that LiP was the major enzyme secreted by S.
commune IBL-06 for decolorization of Solar brilliant red 80.
The effect of variation on decolorization of different textiledyes by a variety of micro-organisms has been reported
(Sawhney and Kumar, 2011; Asgher et al., 2012c; Kumar
et al., 2012 ). Most of the WRF secrete different sets of lignin-
olytic enzymes during the decolorization of different dyes that
is favored in pH range of 3–6 ( Asgher et al., 2008 ).
3.2. Effect of incubation temperature
The UV–Visible spectra of dye ( Fig. 5 ), enzyme activity pro-
ﬁles and dye decolorization pattern ( Fig. 6 ) showed maximum
decolorization (89.2%) of Solar brilliant red 80 in the optimum
pH ﬂasks incubated at 30 /C176C after 4 days that decreased at fur-
ther increase in temperatures. Maximum LiP (625 U/mL)activity was also noted in culture ﬁltrates shaken at 30 /C176C.Swamy and Ramsay (1999) and Asgher et al., (2008) also ob-
served increase in fungal dye decolorization efﬁciency with ini-
tial rise in temperature to up to certain optimum levels and
inhibition of the organism growth and enzyme formation at
higher temperatures. For mostly white rot fungi the optimumtemperatures for decolorization of chemically differentdyestuffs have been reported in the range from 25 to 37 /C176C
(Asgher et al., 2009 ). It has also been reported that WRF like
P. chrysosporium and Coriolus versicolor give maximum dye
decolorization around 35 /C176C; temperatures below 25 /C176C and
above 40 /C176C inhibit fungal growth and ligninolytic enzymes
synthesis WRF ( Assadi et al., 2001; Asgher et al., 2008 ).
3.3. Effect of additional carbon and nitrogen sources
Different combination of carbon and nitrogen had different
inﬂuences on enzyme synthesis and decolorization efﬁciency
of the fungus for Solar brilliant red 80. However, the combina-
tion of maltose and ammonium sulfate caused maximum dyecolor removal (91.5%) in 3 days, followed by glucose andammonium di-hydrogen phosphate (86.6%), ( Table 1 ). Maxi-
mum LiP synthesis (775 U/mL) was also noted in the ﬂasks
receiving maltose and ammonium sulfate. Similarly, the decol-orization efﬁciency of T. versicolor was also enhanced with
increasing concentrations of ammonium nitrate ( Asgher
et al., 2009 ). Additional carbon and nitrogen sources have also
previously been reported to enhance the formation of lignino-
lytic enzymes involved in dye removal ( Selvam et al., 2006;
Asgher et al., 2012a ).
3.4. Effect of inoculam size
Varying volumes of fresh fungal spore inoculum (1–7 mL)
were used to inoculate the triplicate decolorization ﬂasks andthe ﬂasks were incubated for stipulated time period at opti-
mum pH and temperature. The change in UV–Visible spectra,
enzymes synthesis and dye decoloriztion in response to varyinginculum size under optimum conditions has been displayed in
Figs. 7 and 8 . Complete decolorization (100%) of the direct
dye Solar brilliant red 80 after 3 days of incubation time periodwas observed in the ﬂasks receiving 5 mL inoculum of

orization rate increased with an increase in inoculum size from1–5 mL but a further increase in inoculum density caused
reduction in the decolorization efﬁciency of the fungus that
may be due to early depletion of nutrients. For best enzymeproduction and dye decolorization the bio-technological pro-
cesses involving microorganisms require an optimum amount
of the microbial spores/cells ( Radha et al., 2005; Asgher
et al., 2009 ). Similar to our ﬁndings, Sivaraj et al., 2011 and
Kumar et al., 2012 , who also reported 4.0% (v/v) optimum
inoculum density for textile wastewater decolorization.4. Conclusions
The decolorization process for Solar brilliant red 80 using
fresh fungal culture was optimized and complete decoloriza-
tion (100%) of the dye was achieved in 3 days at pH 4 and
30/C176C using 5 mL spore inoculums which was correlated
with the maximum formation of LiP (944 U/mL) followed
by MnP and Lac activities. The indigenous WRF strain
S. commune IBL-06 with its efﬁcient ligninolytic enzyme sys-
tem has an excellent scope for use in the treatment of industrial
efﬂuents that contain unused residual textile dyes.
