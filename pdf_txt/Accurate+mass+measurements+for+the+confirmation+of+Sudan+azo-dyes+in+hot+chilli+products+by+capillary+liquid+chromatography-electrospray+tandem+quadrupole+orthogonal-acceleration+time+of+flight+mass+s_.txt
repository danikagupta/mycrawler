A wide range of lipophilic and moderately polar 
synthetic dyes is used in industry for colouring 
various materials such as mineral oils, waxes, 
solvents, textile and leather garments, etc. The 
use of these dyes in foods is not allowed because 
of the health concerns related to their intake. In 
spite of this fact, in May of 2003 France provided 
the information through the Rapid Alert System 
for Food and Feed (RASFF) on the discovery of 
the dye Sudan I in hot chilli products originated 
from India, its levels being as high as 4000 mg/kg 
(ASTA 2005). By the end of this year, 119 notifi -
cations had been provided to the RASFF system 
(RASFF 2003). With regard to the growing problem, 
the European Commission issued a decision on emergency measures (2003/460/EC) whereby the 
Member States prohibit the import of hot chilli 
and hot chilli products unless the analytical report 
accompanying the consignment demonstrates that 
the products do not contain any Sudan I. In a short 
time, this Commission decision was amended by 
Decision 2004/92/EC for Sudans II–IV. In the fol -
lowing period, Sudan I and IV were observed in 
some commodities examined, such as chilli and 
chilli products, curcuma, curry, sumac and palm 
oil (RASFF 2004). 
In addition to this types of Sudan, several other 
illegal dyes have also been discovered in imported 
spices and spice products (RASFF 2005). Under 
scrutiny are Para Red, Sudan Orange G, Sudan Determination of Banned Dyes in Spices by Liquid

Abstract
Botek P., Poustka J.,  Hajšlová  J. (2007 ): Determination of banned dyes in spices by liquid chroma -
tography–mass spectrometry . Czech J. Food Sci., 25: 17–24.
A simple and rapid multiresidue method for the determination of nine banned synthetic dyes in various spices has 
been developed. Reversed phase HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry (tandem in time – ion trap mass analyser) 
was employed for the examination of crude acetonitrile extract acidified with acetic acid. The detection limits of Para 
Red, Sudan Orange G, Sudan I, Sudan II, Sudan III, Sudan IV, Sudan Red 7B and Rhodamine B were in the range of 
0.02–0.1 mg/kg, the recoveries ranged from 75.7 to 92.3% with repeatability of 0.9–11.3%. Rather worse performance 
characteristics were obtained with Tropaeolin 000, obviously due to its more polar nature as compared to other dyes 
involved in this study. In spite of that, the developed method can be used for a reliable control of a wide range of dyes 
used for illegal colouring of various spices.

Red 7B and Rhodamine B. They are not approved 
in foods, according to the European Parliament 
and Council Directive 94/36/EC on colours for 
use in foodstuffs (EFSA 2005). The overview of 
the structures of the compounds under concern 
in this study is shown in Figure 1. 
It should be noted that in the opinion of the 
Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, 
Processing Aids, and Materials in Contact with 
Food there is insufficient data on any of the il -
legal dyes, Sudan I–IV, Para Red, Rhodamine B, 
and Orange II, found so far in foods in the EU to 
perform a full risk assessment. However, there is 
experimental evidence that Sudan I is both geno -
toxic and carcinogenic; a similar toxic potential 
was recognised in Rhodamine B. For the other dyes 
mentioned above, conclusive evidence on their 
toxicity for humans is also lacking, nevertheless, 
because of the structural similarities to Sudan I, 
it would be prudent to assume that they are po -
tentially genotoxic and possibly carcinogenic as 
well (EFSA 2005). 
Various methods have been employed for the 
detection (screening) and accurate determina -
tion of synthetic dyes in foodstuffs. As individual 
chemicals are to be controlled in a particular food 
commodity, chromatographic and/or electro -
phoretic separation steps have to be involved in 
the respective procedure. 
As shown in the overview presented in Table 1, 
the existing methods largely differ in their scope as 
well as in the performance characteristics achiev -
able.
The aim of our study was to develop and validate 
a simple and rapid procedure enabling an accurate 
measurement of even low levels of all dyes banned 
under the current concern in EU.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples . Dried chilli and curry (either ground or 
powdered) free of synthetic dyes were used for the 
method development. All samples were purchased 
from Czech retail markets and/or obtained from 
Czech importers.
Standards . The overview of the target dyes is 
shown in Table 2. The concentrations of the stock 
solutions prepared from the solid standards were 
in the range of 0.1–1 mg/ml. With regard to the 
relatively different polarities of the analytes, various 
solvent/solvent mixtures had to be used for their 
preparation. Calibration mixtures containing the

analytes in the range of 0.005 and 10  µg/ml (each 
substance) were prepared in HPLC mobile phase 
(5% acetic acid:acetonitrile (2:98, v/v)). Prior to 
use, the solutions were stored in a refrigerator 
at 4°C. 
Chemicals . The solvents for chromatography 
were HPLC gradient grade acetonitrile (Sigma-
Aldrich, Germany), deionised water was produced 
by Milli-Q apparatus (Millipore, United States), 
and acetic acid, glacial 99.99+%, was obtained 
from Aldrich (United States). HPLC gradient 
grade 2-propanole was purchased from Merck 
(Germany).
Instruments . HPLC-MS system consisted of 
Agilent 1100 series (Agilent, USA) coupled with 
Finnigan LCQ Deca mass spectrometric detector 
(Thermo Finnigan, USA) equipped with APCI (At -
mospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization) and/or 
ESI (ElectroSpray Ionization) ionisation source. 
The sheath gas (nitrogen) and the auxiliary gas 
(nitrogen) were delivered by laboratory nitrogen 
generator (Peak Scientific, USA). The chromato -
graphic data were collected and processed using 
the software Xcalibur 1.1 version.
Method . Sample preparation: crude samples 
were finely ground by the electric blender War -
ing Commercial 38BL40 (Dynamic Corporation 
of America, USA) and 5 g of the representative 
sample were shaken for 30 min with 40 ml 1% 
acetic acid: acetonitrile mixture (5:95, v/v). The 
suspension was then filtered and made up to 50 
ml. Prior to injection, filtration was carried out by 
passing the solution through PTFE syringe filter 
(0.45 µm, Teknokroma, Spain).Table 2. Standards of target analytes

HPLC conditions – eight separation columns 
were tested in the optimalisation process:
(i) non-endcapped – Lichrospher® 100 RP-18;  Lichro-  
spher®	100 RP-8; SUPELCOSILTM LC-18-DB; 
(ii) endcapped – Lichrospher®	100 RP-18e; HyPU -
RITY AQUASTAR; Purospher Star RP-18e;
(iii) embedded – Synergi 4u Fusion – RP 80;  
SUPELCOSILTM ABZ+Plus.
Since the best separation was obtained on the 
Purospher Star RP-18 endcapped column (125 × 
3 mm; 5 µm; Merck, Germany), this column was 
used in all follow-up experiments.
The mobile phase consisted of (A) acetonitrile 
and (B) 5% acetic acid in water. Gradient elution 
was realised as follows: solvent (A) was maintained 
at 43% for 2.5 min, followed by the linear gradient 
to 90% A in 1.5 min and linear gradient to 98%  A 
in 2 min. These conditions were held for 8  min. To 
recondition the column, 5 min post-run with the 
initial mobile phase composition was performed. The mobile phase flow rate was 0.5  ml/min; 20 µl 
of extract was injected. The column temperature 
was 40°C.
MS conditions: mass spectrometric detector 
equipped with ion trap mass analyser (tandem in 
time) was coupled to the HPLC system. Ionisation 
of the effluent components was carried out in the 
negative mode for Tropaeolin 000 and Para Red, 
for the other analytes positive ionisation mode 
was used. The APCI probe was heated to 220°C 
(350°C for Tropaeolin 000). The temperature on 
the heated capillary was 165°C, sheath gas flow and 
aux gas flow were 1.2 and 3.0 l/min, respectively. 
Selected reaction monitoring (SRM – MS/MS) and 	 21Czech J. Food Sci.  Vol. 25, No. 1: 17–24
consecutive reaction monitoring (CRM – MS/MS/MS) 
were used for the quantitation and confirmation 
of the target analytes. MS detector setting details 
are shown in Table 3.
Validation procedure . The validation proce -
dure aimed at the determination of performance 
characteristics was carried out by evaluating the 
detection limits (LODs), selectivity, accuracy, and 
repeatability of measurements.
LODs were evaluated as the minimum concentra -
tion of the analyte that provides a signal to noise 
ratio equal to 3.
Selectivity was assessed by evaluating the matrix 
effects in terms of both the signal intensity and 
the exact mass measurements. For the assessment 
of ion supression/enhancement effects, responses 
of the mixtures of standard mixture solutions in 
the concentration range of 5–10 000 ng/ml were 
compared with responses of the matrix matched 
standard solutions at the same levels. The matrix 
matched standard solutions were prepared by 
evaporating blank chilli extract and subsequently dissolving the residue in the standards mixture 
(10 000 ng/ml). All lower concentration levels 
were obtained by the dilution this matrix matched 
standards solution with blank chilli extract.
The accuracy of results was tested by repeated 
measurements of a spiked blank sample (2  mg/kg). 
The recovery of the method was obtained by com -
paring the analytes response in the spiked sample 
with the matrix matched standard solution at the 
same concentration level. The repeatability of the 
method for the individual analytes was obtained 
by calculating relative standard deviations from 
recoveries.

through the RASFF for the occurrence of unau -
thorised colouring substances contained Sudan  I, 
Sudan  IV, and/or Para Red, the availability of ana -

were occasionally shown to be present in spices, 
seasonings, and/or tomato-based products was 
obviously urgent.
Considering low volatility of the target ana -
lytes (Figure 1), HPLC separation is obviously 
the method of choice for this particular purpose. 
Although widely available UV/PDA detectors can 
be employed under certain conditions, problems 
due to their low selectivity when analysing products 
with high contents of natural pigments (caroten -
oids) can be encountered due to  similarity of their 
spectral characteristics with the target analytes. 
To obtain better selectivity and lower detection 
limits of examined colouring substance, a mass 
spectrometric detector was employed in our study. 
In the first phase of our experiments, the separa -
tion step was optimised. While good and rapid 
separation of Sudan and Para Red dyes was easily 
achieved on all tested reversed phase columns 
(see HPLC conditions), irreversible sorption of 
Rhodamine B occurred on some of them. This problem was eliminated when Purospher Star 
RP-18e (LichroCart 125 × 3 mm; 5  µm) endcapped 
column was used (Figure 2). Good peak shapes and 
baseline resolution were obtained for most dyes 
when 5% acetic acid: acetonitrile mobile phase 
was used (gradient elution). The only compound 
with which no significant improvement of the 
peak shape was obtained was Tropaeolin 000. 
Lower pH value attainable e.g. by the addition of 
formic acid would suppress ionisation of sulphonic 
group contained in this compound, however, this 
solution was not feasible in view of the overall 
performance (the reduction of the analyte signal, 
hence an increase of LODs, occurred when formic 
acid was added).
Identification/quantification of target dyes was 
carried out by mass spectrometric detector em -
ploying tandem in time ion trap mass analyser 
(ITD). Both electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric 
pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) interfaces 
were tested.160 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

Better, i.e. lower detection limits, could be at -
tained for all analytes when using the latter ioni -
sation set-up. 
The only exception was Tropaeolin 000, this 
sulphonated dye provided a distinctly better re -
sponse in ESI mode. 
In Table 4, method performance characteris -
tics are summarised as obtained in the validation 
process.
Matrix effects (i.e. changes in signal intensity 
caused by coeluting co-extracts) were found far 
two of tested  dyes, Rhodamine B and for Tro -
paeolin 000. While in the case of Rhodamine B 
ion enhancement occurred, a significant ion sup -
pression could be observed for Tropaeolin 000 at 
concentrations below 5 mg/kg. 
The confirmation of the analyte identity was 
made in the same run as the quantitative determi -
nation. Because in ion trap mass analyser only one 
abundant ion is yielded by fragmentation in MS2 
(quantitation mass), to get a sufficient sensitivity 
for confirmation MS3 mode was chosen.
Using the method mentioned above, over 20  sam-
ples (sweet chilli, curry, and hot chilli) were ana -
lysed. In three of them (sweet chilli), Para Red dye 
was determined (35–40 mg/kg).
CONCLUSIONS
A simple and rapid HPLC-MS/MS method was 
developed for the analysis of nine synthetic dyes 
in various spices. Not only detection limits fairly 
lower as compared to the procedures employing 
UV detectors can be achieved by this method but also the confirmation (two MS transitions) 
of target analytes is possible within a single run. 
The new method is suitable for the control of 
requirements established in EU legislation on the 
measures related to the potential occurrence of 
the banned dyes in food supply.
