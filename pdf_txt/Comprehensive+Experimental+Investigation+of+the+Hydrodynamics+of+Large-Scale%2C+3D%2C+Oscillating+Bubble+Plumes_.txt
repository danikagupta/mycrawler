Abstract
This work is an experimental investigation on hydrodynamics, mass transfer and
mixing induced by a bubble plume. In chemical engineering, people are often confronted
to mixing problems of liquid and gas to create chemical or biochemical reactions. Most
of the time, bubble columns of large height compared to their diameter, are used for
such kind of processes. But there are also situations using large scale reactors like
tanks for methanization or wastewater treatment. In such conﬁgurations, spargers must
be adapted to reactor dimensions and ﬂuid properties. This is particularly important
for methanization reactors since ﬂuid properties are changing continuously during the
fermentation. In order to understand hydrodynamics, mass transfer and mixing, it is
easier to study bubble swarms, or so called bubble plumes, generated by one single
sparger. Diﬀerent experiments are ﬁgured out in two diﬀerent columns types. First one is
a pseudo two dimensional column (6cm * 35 cm * 130cm ) situated at the LISBP allowing
the application of optical metrological methods. Hence, the gas phase is studied via
shadowgraphy and the liquid phase via PIV. Plus, mixing time measurements after dye
injection are performed and pressure sensors as well as oxygen probes are used. In this
way, one could study the oscillating behavior, the corresponding characteristic frequency,
mass transfer and mixing time scales. Furthermore, local information concerning liquid
and bubble velocity depending on viscosity, surface tension and injection conditions are
presented. Depending on the considered cases, phenomena like bubble plume motion,
bubble induced agitation or turbulence contribute diﬀerently to column mixing.
In order to analyze ﬂuid properties, a copolymer called Breox is used. Moreover, two
diﬀerent spargers generating diﬀerent bubble shapes and sizes are applied to estimate
their impact. Strong coupling between diﬀerent parameters could be highlighted.
Additional experiments in a cylindrical bubble column were performed at the HDZR in
Germany. The same ﬂuids and the same spargers were used in order to compare results
from both geometries. Due to the diﬃculty to apply optical methods, a Wire-Mesh
system recently developed at the HZDR is used to follow the bubble plume motion.
Hence, characteristic frequencies as well as void fractions could be investigated.
Finally, ﬁrst simulations using NEPTUNE CFD code showing encouraging results are
presented at the end of the manuscript. Here as well, characteristic time scales and void
fraction proﬁles are used to perform ﬁrst comparisons.ivv
Résumé
Ce travail est une investigation expérimentale de l’hydrodynamique, du transfert
massique et du mélange induit par un panache de bulles dans des mileux de diﬀérentes
viscosités. Dans l’industrie on est souvent confronté à des problèmes de transfert et
de mélange d’une phase liquide et d’une phase gazeuse aﬁn de provoquer des réactions
chimiques ou biochimiques. La plupart du temps on utilise des colonnes à bulles, simple
à mettre en œuvre, pour ce type de procédé. Mais il existe d’autres situations adaptées
aux très grands volumes comme par exemple les bassins d’aération de traitement des
eaux ou les méthaniseurs. Dans ce cas de ﬁgure, la répartition des injecteurs de gaz
doit être adaptée aux dimensions du bassin et contribuer au mélange du liquide. Ceci
est autant plus vrai pour le bioréacteur de méthanisation où l’état du liquide change
en continu pendant la fermentation. Cependant, il y a un manque d’informations
concernant l’hydrodynamique induit par l’injection de gaz en milieu visqueux. Aﬁn de
mieux comprendre l’écoulement, le transfert massique et ﬁnalement le mélange dans ces
situations, il a été décidé d’étudier le cas d’un panache de bulles, généré par un seul
injecteur dans des liquides de diﬀérentes viscosité. Pour cela des expériences ont été
eﬀectuées dans deux types de colonne à bulles avec injection centrale.
La première colonne à bulles qui constitue le cœur de cette étude, est pseudo bidi-
mensionnelle (6cm * 35 cm * 130cm ) et permet la visualisation du panache. Celui ci
est alors également bidimensionnel ce qui rend plus facile l’application des méthodes
métrologiques optiques telles que l’ombroscopie ou la PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry)
permettant l’étude de la phase gazeuse et de la phase liquide. L’utilisation de deux
cameras distinctes et parfaitement synchronisées a permis l’obtention de champs de
vitesse dans le liquide et une caractérisation précise de la taille, de la forme et de la
vitesse des bulles de façon simultanée. Pour la mesure de la vitesse des bulles une
méthode de traitement de données, appelée BIV (Bubble Image Velocimetry) et inspirée
de la PIV, a été développée. L’utilisation de sondes a oxygène a permis d’étudier le
transfert massique global gaz-liquide. En changeant le gaz injecté, des suivis temporels
de la concentration d’oxygène dissoute dans la phase liquide ont pu être réalisés. Aﬁn
de compléter l’analyse hydrodynamique de la colonne à bulles, des mesures de temps
de mélange ont été mesurés via des expériences de traçage. Pour cela un colorant a été
injecté en zone de paroi. Des mesures d’intensité lumineuse et donc d’absorbance ont
servi à suivre la répartition du colorant au cours du temps permettant la caractérisation
du mélange.Le but de notre étude est également la caractérisation du comportement oscillatoire
de la trajectoire sinusoïdale du panache de bulles. Aﬁn de mieux comprendre le
caractère périodique du mouvement de panache, diﬀérentes méthodes d’analyse de séries
temporelles ont été appliquées telles que la fonction de corrélation ou la transformée
de Fourier. De cette façon diﬀérents temps caractéristiques ont pu être identiﬁés. De
plus, les contributions énergétiques résultant de ﬂuctuations à diﬀérentes échelles ont pu
être déterminées grâce à une décomposition des champs de vitesse dans la phase liquide,
appelée POD (Proper Orthongonal Decomposition).
L’inﬂuence de la distribution de la taille des bulles, ainsi que l’état du liquide en terme de
viscosité et de tension superﬁcielle constituent l’intérêt principal de cette investigation.
Pour la réalisation des expériences, deux systèmes d’injection ont été utilisés. Le premier
permet d’injecter des bulles ellipsoïdales de l’ordre de quelques millimètres à travers
une membrane et le deuxième d’injecter des calottes sphériques de l’ordre de quelques
centimètres. Pour la création de calottes, un tube d’un mètre créant des bulles de Taylor,
relachées à la base au centre de la colonne, est utilisé. De plus, trois débits d’injection
permettant la création d’un large spectre de conditions d’injection ont été choisi (50;
100; 200l
h). Pour l’étude de l’inﬂuence des propriétés de la phase liquide, un copolymère
appelé Breox, est utilisé. Il permet de modiﬁer la tension superﬁcielle et la viscosité tout
en ayant un comportement parfaitement Newtonien. Une base de données complète a
ainsi pu être créée.
Une seconde colonne à bulles a été utilisée dans le cadre d’un séjour au HZDR en
Allemagne aﬁn d’étendre les expériences aux conditions tridimensionnelles. La colonne
est cylindrique et a un diamètre de 39.2cm et une hauteur de 160cm ce qui la rend
comparable à la colonne pseudo bidimensionnelle. Du aux diﬃcultés d’appliquer des
méthodes métrologiques optiques, un système Wire-Mesh récemment développé au
HZDR a été utilisé pour suivre le mouvement du panache. De cette façon, on a pu
prouver la présence d’un comportement oscillatoire en conditions tridimensionnelles.
Aﬁn de pouvoir comparer ces résultats au cas 2D, les deux mêmes systèmes d’injection,
les trois mêmes débits, les trois mêmes vitesses de gaz superﬁcielle et les mêmes ﬂuides
ont été utilisés. Ceci a permis de comparer deux géométries distinctes avec des conditions
similaires.
Finalement, des simulations CFD transitoire et 3D de nos expériences ont été réalisées
sur NEPTUNE CFD. Pour tester la capacité de l’outil à reproduire numériquement
le comportement oscillatoire du panache de bulles dans des conditions connues et
maitrisées, diﬀérents termes de fermeture exprimant le transfert interfacial de la quantité
de mouvement ont été testés. La comparaison entre la simulation et l’expérience montre
des résultats très encourageants.

4Introduction
The present manuscript is dealing with multiphase ﬂow appearing in industrial processes
in the ﬁeld of chemical engineering. In all kinds of industrial ﬁelds, mixing of gas and
liquid is used to transfer species in order to provoke chemical or biochemical reactions. A
simple, cheap and eﬃcient way to realise it, is the application of bubble columns where
gas bubbles are injected at the column bottom in a stagnant liquid. This kind of reac-
tor is widely used for many diﬀerent industrial applications, but column dimensions as
well as injection conditions must be adapted to process objectives and ﬂuid properties.
Besides the simple and cheap construction, bubble columns show other advantages like
low operation costs, good mass transfer eﬃciency and mixing abilities. The present work
is focussing on last one. In general, bubble columns are homogeneously aerated, which
means that gas is injected at column bottom through a sparger with equally spaced injec-
tion holes distributed over the whole horizontal column cross section. Such conﬁgurations
show high gas hold-up and consequently high values of interfacial area and are therefore
used in many diﬀerent ﬁelds like petrochemistry (Fischer-Tropsch process, oxidation of
hydrocarbons, oligomerization of ethylene), pharmaceutical, agri-food, cosmetic indus-
tries or more recent applications like algae cultivation.
The second conﬁguration where mixing is performed via gas injection in a stagnant liquid
is a large tank (of order of several meters in diameter). In such reactors, mixing is the ﬁrst
aim and only afterwards mass transfer. Current applications are aeration in wastewater
treatment, mixing in methanization reactors, tank destratiﬁcation, ice prevention as well
as swell destruction along the coasts and many more. Besides, a better understanding of
bioreactor mixing can also avoid sedimentation of suspended particles as well as surface
rind. Two concrete examples of industrial applications can be seen in ﬁgure 1. On the left
5Introduction
side of the ﬁgure, the valorization cycle of organic waste by methanization is presented.
By mixing such reactors anerobic digestion of organic matter can be improved to increase
the production of biogas or more precisely methan. The production of combustibles like
methane is still very important because of the dependancy of our society on combustion
as energy source. This will not change in the next several decades. Consequently, we
must look for new ways of fuel production and for optimizing existing ones.
In the considered case, the biodigestion where the fermentation of green and biodegrad-
able waste producing biogas is taking place, is the most important step. By well mixing
such bioreactors, biomass becomes more homogeneous, biochemical reactions are better
controled and consequently the whole process becomes more productive. One way to
achieve eﬃcient mixing is the injection of recirculated biogas in form of bubbles at the
bottom. Hence, detailed knowledge of bubble induced hydrodynamics is needed in order
to deﬁne adequate sparger distances and characteristics like ﬂow rates and bubble shapes.
Plus, during the fermentation process, ﬂuid properties like viscosity or surface tension are
changing continuously whatfore injection conditions must be adapted regularly.
On the right side of ﬁgure 1, the cycle of a wastewater treatment plant is shown. In
the middle of the process an aeration tank is used where bacteria consume nitrogen and
carbones. These bacteria need oxygen supply which is ensured by aeration. In the case
of such large aeration tanks as well, the understanding of mixing is very important to
carry out correct scale-up and deﬁne optimal operation conditions. In this way, produc-
tivity shall be increased while decreasing energy consumption. Like in other bioreactors,
wastewater plants are confronted to complex ﬂuids due to the presence of chemical and
biochemical products which makes the understanding of mixing even more diﬃcult.
Figure 1: Examples of Bubble Plume Applications
6In order to analyse global mixing in such reactors, hydrodynamics induced by a single
sparger must be analysed ﬁrst which brings us back to bubble columns. By modifying
injection conditions to a single spot sparger, this kind of experimental facility, which is
called heterogeneously aerated bubble column in literature, can be used to study such
ﬂow regimes. A more detailted deﬁnition is given in the next chapter.
Anyway, spot gas injection in a stagnant liquid generates two phase ﬂow structures which
are called bubble swarms or bubble plumes which is the subject of this investigation.
These bubble plumes show oscillating behaviour producing large eddies at a so called
meso scale. This scale, somewhere in between macro scale corresponding to the size of a
whole tank and the microscale, relates local phenomena characterized by liquid properties
to local hydrodynamics like vortex cells to macro mixing of bioreactors. Therefore,
the current work investigates hydrodynamics of bubble plumes in viscous ﬂuids and its
contribution to mixing. The oscillating behaviour and the dispersion depend on several
parameters like bubble size and shape, ﬂow rate and liquid properties like surface tension
as well as viscosity. Unfortunalty, there is a big gap of knowledge when is comes to
bubble size and viscosity inﬂuences on bubble plumes. Hence, during the present study,
two diﬀerent sparger types and several liquids characterized by diﬀerent viscosities are
used. Plus, experiments were performed in two diﬀerent bubble column geometries. First
one is a ﬂat pseudo two dimensional column situated at the LISBP in Toulouse while
the second one is cylindrical, three dimensional and situated at the HZDR in Dresden.
The understanding of such bubble induced ﬂows will help to resolve concrete problems
such as correct scale-up and ﬁnding optimum operation conditions of large bioreactors
with complex ﬂuids enabling CFD simulations, in order to making it predictible. To
realize such a big step large databanks have to be aquired which will be mainly the
object of the present work. But before, one has to make a step backwards and go to
fundamental physics and to isolated single bubbles in order to understand mesoscale
mixing phenomena.
After an introduction in bubble dynamics, two chapters are dedicated to the description
of experimental setups, data treatment and analysis of physical results. The last chapter
show ﬁrst encouraging results of CFD simulations in water which must be extended to
other ﬂuids approaching our goal to develop predictive tools for complex two phase ﬂow
situations.

8Chapter I
Bubbly Flow
This chapter is an introduction in bubble dynamics with its properties, ﬂow behaviours
and deﬁnitions. Furthermore, the notion of bubble columns including type characteriza-
tion and ﬂow structure identiﬁcation is presented.
I.1 Bubble Dynamics
Bubbles are light particles ﬁlled with gaz of density gand surrounded by a liquid phase
of densitylwhich are separated by an interface. Shapes can diﬀer from one bubble
to another depending on its size and ﬂuid properties like surface tension and viscosity.
Such carateristics show great importance concerning bubbly ﬂows in nature as well as in
industrial processes. Anyway, there is still lack of knowledge when it comes to momentum
exchange between the two phases. In literature, a lot of diﬀerent authors investigated in
detail all kind of bubble properties. The book from Clift, Grace and Weber (Clift et al.,
1978) is probably the most popular work and the most complete review of its kind.
I.1.1 Size & Shape
In dispersed ﬂows like bubbly ﬂows it is important to characterize present particles of
the dispersed phase properly. Clear deﬁnitions are needed to describe size and shape in
order to compare results with those from literature.
9Chapter I. Bubbly Flow
Equivalent Diameter To determine particle or bubble size for all kinds of shapes
(spherical, ellipsoidal, etc...) in the same way, an equivalent diameter is generally used.
Two diﬀerent deﬁnitions exist and the most suitable one depending on the particle nature
(solid or deformable) can be chosen. Most often size measurements, at least visual ones,
give two dimensional data. This means that the captured three dimensional particle can
only be seen from one side which makes an exact characterization diﬃcult. Nevertheless,
the projected two dimensional area can be used to determine the equivalent diameter.
It is known that two bodies (here 2D) having same mass (here surface) and inertia
ellipsoid (here inertia ellipse) are dynamically equivalent. By calculating eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the inertia tensor of the raw area, small mand largeMaxis lengths and
orientations can be obtained, respectively. Inertia moment calculations are presented in
detail in section II.1.3.3.
The ﬁrst possible equivalent diameter is the one of a circle having the same area than
the projected ellipse. In this case no additional assumption is done.

AEllipse =mM (I.2)
DE=p
4mM (I.3)
whereACircleandAEllipsecorrespond to the area of a circle and an ellipse, respectively.
The second possibility which is better adapted to deformable bubbles, uses the volume
instead of the surface. Therefore, the assumption that bubbles corresponds to ellipsoids
with one small axis and two large axis is done. (Moore, 1959) showed that bubbles with
small distortion take the shape of an oblate spheroid. The equivalent diameter of a
spheroid having the same volume than the ellipsoid can be calculated. In this way, the
ﬂattened spherical nature of rising ellipsoidal bubbles can be taken into account.

whereVCircleandVEllipsecorrespond to the volume of a circle and an ellipse, respec-
tively.
Eccentricity The shape of an ascending bubble depends on the equilibrium between
surface tension forces which are hindering deformation and ambient hydrostatic as well as
dynamic pressure forces which are ﬂattening the bubble. During the ascending motion,
the liquid has to get around the bubble and therefore accelerates. This generates a
decreasing pressure distribution from the bubble front to its sides. Hence, the surface
moves outwards and the local curvature increases (FAN & Tsuchiya, 2013). In other
words, bubbles experience a compressive and dilating force in streamwise and transverse
direction, respectively, which generates an ellipsoidal shape. For this reason it makes
sense to use bubble eccentricity as a second characteristic that can be calculated by
taking the ratio of the large axis Mand the small one mfrom the above mentioned ellipse.

This ellipse can serve to describe and to distinguish three principal bubble shapes. The
ﬁrst one is the spherical shape where surface tension is much higher than the dynamic
pressure which can also be expressed by:

which is true for undeformable bubbles (low Weber numbers) and where Ubis the
bubble velocity and the surface tension. Spherical bubbles begin to deform when vicsous
forces become more important than inertia (high Morton number):

Three of these dimensionless numbers were used by (Clift et al., 1978) to characterize
bubble shapes as illustrated in ﬁgure I.1. Depending on Reynolds and Eötvös numbers
every bubble type is categorized. Liquid properties like surface tension and viscosity are
taken into account as well. In ﬂuid dynamics, as it is also the case in other scientiﬁc ﬁelds,
dimensionless numbers are used to compare same phenomena in diﬀerent conﬁgurations
and at diﬀerent scales. For bubbles and droplets, it is generally admitted to use the
above mentioned ones.
The eccentricity can be directly expressed as a function of the Weber number. This
was done in theoretical (Moore, 1965) and experimental (Duineveld, 1995) works that can
be found in literature. For low Morton numbers, (Moore, 1965) proposed the following
analytical solution:
= 1 +9
64We (I.17)
Besides, (Duineveld, 1995) proposed an empirical solution for ultra pure water:
We= 4:41 4:392(I.18)
suggesting that I.17 is slightly overestimating the deformation. More recently, (Legen-
dreet al., 2012) proposed the following equation depending on both, Weber and Morton
number:
=1
1 9
64We(1 +K(Mo)We) 1(I.19)
whereK(Mo) = 0:2Mo1=10. Deformation takes place for Mo10 10. With
further increasing Morton number deformation is also increasing and bubbles are getting
more and more ﬂattened. The authors also conﬁrm that for low Morton numbers the
eccentricity depends only on the Weber number. Equation I.19 is valid in the ellipsoidal
regime for moderate Weber numbers or in other words for bubbles in water of order of
13Chapter I. Bubbly Flow

several millimeters.
The second regime, with an eccentricity range between 1and2, is the ellipsoidal one
showing non-axisymmetric bubble shapes resulting from non-rectilinear trajectories and
unsteady wakes. This so called path instability was mentioned by (Ryskin & Leal, 1984b)
and already observed for small distortions. There is a strong coupling between interface
deformations and the surrounding ﬂow structure. Hence, the interface mobility plays
an important role, but depends on the system purity. Further informations about this
regime are discussed in section I.1.3.1. For this regime (Wellek et al., 1966) suggested
the following correlation:
= 1 + 0:185Eo0:8(I.20)
The last regime shows the appearance of large spherical cap bubbles. In literature,
only few works dealing with the shape of such large bubbles, can be found and no
clear explanation is given. Authors like (Ryskin & Leal, 1984a) and (Batchelor, 1987)
investigated for reasons of such shapes via stability analysis. While (Ryskin & Leal,
1984a) deﬁned the cap shape as consequence of ﬂow separation, (Batchelor, 1987) went
deeper inside the subject and investigated for maximum bubble size and break-up criteria
as well. The authors concluded that over a critical bubble size, no stable solution or
stable bubble shape is possible anymore. Anyway, the eccenticity range can be given. For
this regime varies from values around 2until values up to 5. The upper limit depends
strongly on ﬂuid properties.
I.1.2 Mass Transfer
One important aspect in bubbly ﬂows is the mass transfer between the liquid and the gas
phase through the bubble interphase. Independent of involved species, mass transfer is
generated by an imbalance of substances between both phases. In industries, all kinds
of chemical or biochemical products are brought together to provoke reactions. If they
come from separate phases, most of the time bubble columns are used to bring them into
15Chapter I. Bubbly Flow
contact. Hence, mass transfer ﬂux is appearing.
In fundamental research, the thermodynamic equilibrium of oxygen and nitrogen is used
to evaluate mass transfer. Either by nitrogen injection or by a chemical reaction, the
dissolved oxygen concentration in the liquid phase can be decreased close to zero. Then
air bubbles are injected where the oxygen tends to the liquid phase in order to balance
oxygen concentration between both phases. By following the oxygen concentration in the
liquid phase, an overall averaged ﬂux can be determined. This ﬂux is expressed as kLa,
composed of an exchange coeﬃcient kLand the interfacial exchange area a.
In literature, many investigations can be found. Two of the most famous ones are the
book written by (Higbie, 1935) or the work from (Danckwerts, 1951).
(Higbie, 1935) investigated laminar ﬂows where ﬂuid elements enter the interface at the
front, are transported by interface convection before leaving it at the tail. The authors
proposed the following simple expression for a characteristic time scale:
 1
c=Ub
DE(I.21)
Unfortunately, the authors neglect eﬀects like bubble deformation or wakes. How-
ever, later publications show that ﬂow structures show great inﬂuence on mass transfer.
(Fortescue, G., Pearson, J., 1967) proposed that mass transfer in isotropic turbulent ﬂow
is controled by large eddies. Hence, they concluded that the inverse of the characteristic
time scale must be proportional to the ratio of kinetic energy and dissipation k:
 1
c=
k(I.22)
On the other hand, (Lamont and Scott, 1970) suggested that in highly turbulent
ﬂows (like stirring tanks) small eddies exchange surrounding ﬂuid and further interfacial
transfer. That is why the authors proposed for the characteristic time scale:
 1
c=
(I.23)
whereis the liquid viscosity. These inﬂuences from the surrounding ﬂow (laminar
or turbulent) inducing Reynolds stress close to the interface, interface mobility and
therefore its contamination play an important role in mass transfer, but are diﬃcult to
estimate. For an exact characterization, information about the interfacial area must
16I.1. Bubble Dynamics
be known as well. Hence, depending on the bubble type (deformable or not) and ﬂow
situations, mass transfer can be furthered or not. For these reasons, mass transfer will
not be investigated in detail in this work because all these parameters are diﬃcult to
control in bubble columns. Further analyzes at the interface scale would be required.
Only an averaged kLavalue over the whole column was measured and analyzed.
I.1.3 Bubble Rising Velocity
Bubble’s rising movement can be expressed by the balance equation. To calculate the
trajectory as well as the terminal velocity of an isolated bubble, one must consider all
acting forces described by the following expression:
gVbd~Ub
dt=~f=~fB+~fG+~fD+~fAM+~fL (I.24)
whereVbis the bubble volume, ~Ubthe bubble veclocity, ~fBthe body force, ~fGgravity,
~fDthe drag force, ~fAMthe added mass force and ~fLthe lift force. Drag, lift, gravity and
added mass forces are acting on the bubble interface.
It is well known that bubbles rises through liquids due to buoyancy forces, or in other
words because of the density diﬀerence between gas and liquid phase, until reaching a
free surface. The so called terminal rise velocity, which is a stationary solution, results
mainly from the equilibrium between buoyancy (body force) and the drag force which
expresses the resistance from the liquid phase on the bubble interface against its ﬂow di-
rection. ThreediﬀerentregimescanbedistinguishedinthesamewaythaninsectionI.1.1.
I.1.3.1 Terminal Velocity
In the case of isolated small spherical bubbles without deformation ( Re << 1), the
Stokes solution (Stokes et al., 1880) is of reasonable accuracy. (Hadamard & Hadamard,
1911) and (Rybczyński, 1911) derived the following equation for the terminal velocity:
U1=1
18gD2
E(l g)
l(I.25)
17Chapter I. Bubbly Flow
In the presence of large eddies, drag is becoming more important and bubbles are
trapped by liquid circulation. Since these bubbles do not play an important role in
swarm dynamics, they are not discussed any further.
Withincreasingbubblesize, velocitycalculationsarebecomingmorecomplicated. Lift
forces become important and the bubble begins to zigzag which makes bubble trajectory
longer and therefore a damping eﬀect of the rising velocity can be observed. Plus, a
strong coupling between bubble deformation and trajectory makes calculations even more
diﬃcult. Anyway, (Mendelson, 1967) proposed the following empirical equation for the
terminal bubble velocity:
U1=s
2:14
lDE+gDE
2l(I.26)
In the case of isolated large spherical cap bubbles ( DE>15mm), the trajectory
is becoming straight again which means that only buoyancy and drag force are acting
on the bubble. Hence, (Davies et al., 1950) was able to propose the following rough
approximation:
U1= 0:707p
gDE (I.27)
(Cliftet al., 1978) published ﬁgure I.2 in order to summarize terminal veloci-
ties in function of the equivalent diameter and the Eötvös number. In the range
1mm < D E<15mma huge gap between maximum and minimum values can be ob-
served that can be explained by the interface contamination. A more detailed discussion
is shown is section I.1.3.3.
I.1.3.2 Drag Coeﬃcient and Dimensionless Numbers
An isolated bubble is mainly driven by the equilibrium between buoyancy and drag forces.
Diﬀerent models can be found in literature for the above mentionned bubble types. They
are characterized by diﬀerent drag coeﬃcients and a certain number of investigations for
deformed (ellipsoidal and spherical cap) bubbles were published. Like already mentioned,
the drag force is acting on the bubble interface and in opposite direction of the object

(1978)
motion. This means that the force is constituting the main ﬂow resistance and plays
an important role in bubble terminal velocity. This velocity determines bubble residence
times in the liquid phase and therefore the overall void fraction which illustrates its im-
portance for bubble column reactors. In general, the drag coeﬃcient CDcan be expressed
via three dimensionless numbers, plus a the so called contamination angle c:
CD(1) =f(ReB;Eo;Mo; c) (I.28)
(Maxworthy et al., 1996) showed that the characterization can also be done by using
WeandFrwhich can be written as a combination of the three previous ones.

The authors identiﬁed diﬀerent bubble regimes depending on size and velocity from
19Chapter I. Bubbly Flow
spherical bubbles to spherical caps in a range of 2:710 11<Mo< 5:710 9.
Spherical Regime The drag coeﬃcient for spherical bubbles can be written as follows:

where~Ur=~Ub ~Ulis the relative bubble velocity. Relation I.31 can also be expressed
via dimensionless numbers:

Bubbles with an equivalent diameter approaching 1mm, begin to deform while keeping
a straight trajectory. This regime can be described by:
We2[1;Wec] (I.33)
whereWecis a critical Weber number value which remains the same in the following.
Ellipsoidal Regime The ellipsoidal regime is characterized by trajectory modiﬁcation
from straight to zigzag or helicoidal. As in the previous regime, the ellipsoidal one can
also be described via dimensionless numbers. But ﬁrst, one should distinguish two parts
which was proposed by (Maxworthy et al., 1996). The ﬁrst one is characterized by a
constant Weber number ( Wec=cst) while Reynolds and Eötvös number increase with
increasing size. The corresponding drag coeﬃcient I.32 is still valid in the considered
range and the critical Weber number value corresponds to:
Wec=max(0:517log(Mo) + 7:624; 2:376) (I.34)
(Peebles, FN & Garber, HJ, 1953) and (Wallis, 1974) proposed the corresponding
valuesWec= 3:65andWec= 4, respectively. The borders using the Eötvös number
were also deﬁned by (Maxworthy et al., 1996) :
Eomin= 72:66Mo0:227(I.35)
20I.1. Bubble Dynamics
Eomax=2

(I.36)
(Tomiyama et al., 1998) showed the equivalent drag coeﬃcient for equation I.26 in
function of the Eötvös number:
CD(Eo) =8
3Eo
4 +Eo(I.37)
which tends to the solution of (Davies et al., 1950) for spherical cap bubbles:
CD(Eo> 40) =8
3(I.38)
In order to give a complet overview, one has to mention that (Comolet, 1979) gave a
similar expression:
CD(Eo) =8
3Eo
4:28 + 1:02Eo
(I.39)
The beginning of the second part corresponds to the moment where the Weber number
begins to evolve again in the following manner:
We= 2:5Eo1=3(I.40)
where the Eötvös number vary in the range:
EomaxEo< 7:12 (I.41)
Finally, the corresponding drag coeﬃcient is given as follows:
CD=8
15Eo2=3(I.42)
Spherical Cap Regime Another time, the regime transition can be followed by con-
sidering the Eötvös number. The borders for spherical cap bubbles were deﬁned as:
7:12Eo< 40 (I.43)
The related Weber number is written as:
21Chapter I. Bubbly Flow
We= 1:25 + 0:5Eo (I.44)
The corresponding drag coeﬃcient is deﬁned as:
CD=8
3Eo
2:5 +Eo
(I.45)
In conclusion, most of the intermediate ellipsoidal expressions could be derived from
the viscous dissipation of a potential ﬂow. This assumption can not be applied to all bub-
ble types since wake instabilities can be involved, which is in contradiction with potentiel
ﬂow. Anyway, the drag coeﬃcient for the considered experimental conditions of this work
can be given only as a function of the Eötvös and the critical Weber number.

For Eö!1equation I.47 tends to I.32. Complementary experimental data was
recorded by (Talaia, n.d.) who proposed a global expression for air - glycerol and air -
water systems where inertia and dynamic viscosity are the dominant terms. The authors
proposed empirical relations between the drag coeﬃcient and the Reynolds number as
well as between the terminal velocity and the equivalent diameter for a large bubble size
range ( 0:1mm < D E<10mm). Their results are in good agreement with I.27 for large
bubbles.
I.1.3.3 Contamination
Another parameter which must be considered is the contamination of the system having
great impact on bubble interface’s mobility. This is the reason for large terminal velocity
variations for a given bubble size which is illustrated in ﬁgure I.2. The upper limit
corresponds to pure water while the down limit corresponds to completely contaminated
22I.1. Bubble Dynamics
water. In the current work, contamination could not be determined and is therefore
considered to be constant and was not further investigated. Nevertheless, a short
discussion about the subject should be done. First, one must evaluate the contamination
degree of the system. (Cuenot et al., 1997) deﬁned the following four situations depending
on the adsorption and desorption of impurities on the interface:
- impurities are advected in the bubble wake and do not reach the interface which is
still mobile,
- only few impurities are adsorpted on the bubble interface which is still mobile,
- impurities are adsorpted and convected to the bubble bottom on the interface which
is partially mobile,
- the interface is completely contaminated and immobile; the bubble can be considered
as solid sphere.
(Sadhal & Johnson, 1983) used the angle cto deﬁne the degree of contamination and
included it in the following drag coeﬃcient expression:
C
d(c) =CD(c) Cm

whereCim

ReBcorrespond to a completely contaminated and to
a completely clean bubble drag coeﬃcient, respectively, in Stokes ﬂow conditions for
spherical bubbles. Plus the range could be extended via the correlation of (Schiller &
Naumann, 1933) to moderate Reynlods numbers:
CD=24
ReB(1 + 0:15Re0:687
B) (I.49)
Several investigations like (Tomiyama et al., 1998), (FAN & Tsuchiya, 2013) or (Max-
worthyet al., 1996) gave drag coeﬃcient correlations for moderate Reynolds numbers
which are in agreement with the experimental results from (Gaudin, 1957). All of them
described a decreasing drag coeﬃcient evolution with increasing Reynolds number until
a local minimum in the range of 200<Re< 500. At higher Reynlods numbers, the drag
coeﬃcient is increasing again and converging towards a value between 3 and 4. Anyway,
the main conclusion on bubble interface contamination is that impurity charged bubbles
23Chapter I. Bubbly Flow
show lower rising velocities than clean ones corresponding to higher drag coeﬃcients:
CDcCD (I.50)
I.1.3.4 Swarm Eﬀect
Anyway, the present investigation is not dealing with isolated bubbles, but with bubble
swarms. Bubbles interact with eachother and can even coalesce or break-up. This makes
it diﬃcult to estimate the rising velocity, especially in the case of polydisperse bubble size
distribution. (Batchelor, 1972), (Wijngaarden & Kapteyn, 1990) and (Koch, 1993) inves-
tigated dispersed ﬂows with void fraction under 5%. They concluded that for such dilute
ﬂows, bubble interactions are mainly binary and induce trajectory modiﬁcation. (Hallez
& Legendre, 2011) studied numerically the interactions between two bubbles ascend-
ingsidebysideinstagnantliquid. Theauthorsgavethreepossiblecontributionwhichare:
- potential eﬀect
- viscous correction (or Moore correction)
- wake eﬀects
The wake eﬀects were already investigated in detail by (Cartellier & Rivière, 2001)
and (Cartellier et al., 2009). The authors reported a decreasing probability of the second
bubble being in the wake of the ﬁrst one due to lift force. Last one favors bubble ejection
from the wake. However, (Wallis, 1969), (Garnier et al., 2002) and (Riboux et al., 2010)
showed a decreasing bubble velocity with increasing void fraction. This result is in
agreement with (Legendre et al., 2003) who investigated the infuence of the distance
between two bubbles rising side by side via numerical simulations. They deﬁned a
critical distance under which the vorticity of the bubbles interact, modifying the pressure
distribution and increasing the drag coeﬃcient. This phenomenon is in competition with
another one reported by (Bouche et al., 2012) who studied bubble interaction at high
Reynolds numbers. They concluded that bubble induced agitation modiﬁes the viscous
dissipation behind the ﬁrst bubble which entrains the following one. This eﬀects the
drag coeﬃcient which decreases with increasing void fraction. A wake acceleration eﬀect
was also reported by (Krishna et al., 1999). The authors showed an increasement of
24I.1. Bubble Dynamics
the averaged gas velocity by a factor of 3to6for large bubble swarms depending on
column dimensions, bubble sizes and void fractions. The highest velocities were recorded
in churnﬂow conditions. It seems that depending on bubble size and shape as well as on
the void fraction, the drag coeﬀcient can increase or decrease which makes it diﬃcult to
estimate correct bubble swarm velocities, especially in the case of polydispersed bubble
size distribution. All aﬀecting parameters are driven by liquid properties and injection
conditions. This is conﬁrmed by (León-Becerril et al., 2002) and (Roghair et al., 2011)
who explained the dispersion of results in literature by eccentricity and Eötvös number
variations. However, two swarm velocity corrections from literature can be given for
dilute bubbly ﬂows.
1)The ﬁrst one was developped by (Milne Thomson L.N., 1962) who derived via
the potential ﬂow assumption, an interesting expression for the drag coeﬃcient for non-
isolated ellipsoidal bubbles while taking into account eccentricity:
Ur=Ur1(1 P()g) (I.51)
with
P() =1:43(2 +Z())
3(I.52)
where
Z() = 2(2 1)1=2 acos( 1)
acos( 1) (2 1)1=2
2(I.53)
Both equations are plotted in ﬁgure I.3 (left). The resulting velocity for a given void
fraction of 0:5%and a terminal velocity of 0:25m
sfor a single bubble, is plotted in ﬁgure
I.3 (right). In our case Pdoes not exceed the value of 3which means that the velocity is
almost not modiﬁed.
2)The second one is the drift ﬂux model introduced by (Zuber & Findlay, 1965) and
adapted by (Wallis, 1969) for the drift velocity:
Ub=U1(1 g)n(I.54)
25Chapter I. Bubbly Flow
Figure I.3: Left: Z()andP()in function of ; Right: Bubbble Velocity as a function

By applying a ﬁrst order approximation one obtains:
Ub=U1(1 ng) (I.55)
where for bubbly ﬂows nwas found to be 2and 2:39by (Wallis, 1969) and by
(F Richardson & N. Zaki, 1954), respectively.
I.2 Bubble Columns
The mixing ability of bubble columns depends mostly on the present ﬂow structure
induced by the injected gas bubbles. Depending on liquid properties, column geometry
and injection conditions, diﬀerent ﬂow regimes can be observed. Furthermore, two bubble
column categories can be distinguished. In literature, several authors like (Drahoš et al.,
1991), (Zahradnik et al., 1997) or (Diaz et al., 2006) illustrated ﬂow regime characteri-
zationintermsofgashold-updependingonthesuperﬁcialgasvelocitywhichisdeﬁnedas:

Asection(I.56)
whereQinletis the injection ﬂow rate and Asectionthe surface of the horizontal bubble
column cross section.
26I.2. Bubble Columns
In ﬁgure I.4 the above mentionned parameters are used to characterize bubble column
types. The solid line indicates qualitatively diﬀerent ﬂow regimes as a function of
the superﬁcial gas velocity in the case of homogeneously aerated bubble columns. At
low gas injection, the dispersed bubble regime is characterized by an uniformly rising
bubble swarm with almost uniform gas hold-up in the bubble column cross section. With
increasing superﬁcial gas velocity heterogeneities in form of large eddies appear indicating
the beginning of the transition regime. Finally, with further increasing superﬁcial gas
velocity a local minimum in the gas hold-up deﬁnes the beginning of the so called
turbulent regime (I.4).
The second category, heterogeneously aerated bubble columns, are presented by the
dashed line. The ﬂow structure takes the shape of a bubble plume for higher aspect
ratios than 2:25. For the whole range of superﬁcial gas velocities, no regime transition
characterized by the gas hold-up evolution can be observed. The present ﬂow regime can
be recognized by large ascending bubbles in the column middle and small descending
bubbles along the column edges.
Figure I.4: Identiﬁcation of ﬂow structures depending on superﬁcial gas velocity by Diaz
et al. (2006)
27Chapter I. Bubbly Flow
The present contribution focuses only on mixing abilities of bubble plumes generated
in heterogeneously aerated bubble columns. The facility is used to study hydrodynam-
ics of an isolated plume in order to better understand meso- and macro-scale mixing of
large bioreactors. But even if such bubble columns show lower void fractions, it is still
diﬃcult to obtain local time resolved experimental data for both phases. For this reason
we have chosen to work mainly with a pseudo two dimensional bubble column allowing
the application of visual metrological methods like Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and
Shadowgraphy. In addition, some complementary experiments were performed in a cylin-
drical three dimensional bubble column as used in industries.
However, many authors were interested in the characterization of bubble plumes in pseudo
two dimensional bubble columns in order to develop predictive tools like CFD simulation.
Exact mechanisms and phenomena furthering mixing are still unclear since ﬂuid dynam-
ics depend on complex interactions between phases concerning mass, momentum, and
energy transfer. Characteristics length and time scales of macromixing are unpredictible
due to the lack of model and the lack of experimental informations. Especially eﬀects of
surface tension and viscosity are poorly or not at all investigated. Therefore, models with
adequate closure terms have to be tested and compared to experimental data.
A large spectrum of investigations concerning cylindrical bubble columns can also be
found in literature. Most authors were interested in the understand of the voidage to
superﬁcial gas velocity relation including regime transition and were looking for suitable
ﬂow pattern characterization ((Akita & Yoshida, 1973); (Deckwer, 1980); (Hikita et al.,
1980); (Maruyama et al., 1981); (Zahradnik et al., 1997); (Vial et al., 2000); (Ruzicka
et al., 2001); (Gourich et al., 2006) ; (León-Becerril et al., 2002)). All of them studied
homogenously aerated columns showing uniform bubble swarms in most cases. Only few
authors like (Simiano et al., 2006) or (Rensen & Roig, 2001) used 3D bubble columns with
a small injection area in the column center, which can be considered as single spot injec-
tion, to investigate bubble plumes. This conﬁguration can also be modiﬁed to so called
pseudo two dimensional bubble columns which allows the application of optical metro-
logical methods (Sokolichin et al., 1997). The almost two dimensional column geometry
damps three dimensional mesoscale instabilities which generates a quasi two dimensional
bubble plume.
28I.3. Pseudo-2D Bubble Columns
I.3 Pseudo-2D Bubble Columns
In the case of pseudo two dimensional bubble columns a sinusoidal trajectory of ascending
bubbles predominates the column ﬂow regime while a helical trajectory predominates in
the case of cylindrical bubble columns. In both column types, bubble plumes show large
ascending bubbles in the column middle and small descending bubbles at the column
edges captured by liquid recirculation. All acting mixing mechanisms are the same,
which explains the interest of pseudo-2D columns.
Becker et al. (Becker et al., 1994) gave the state of art of modelling of gas-liquid ﬂows
in bubble columns and confronted results to experimental observations. They were
able to reproduce experimental results with numerical simulations based on a dynamic
laminar two-dimensional two-phase Euler-Euler model. A strong inﬂuence of the gas
distribution system which will be discused later, was also mentionned. (Delnoij et al.,
1997) proposed an Eulerian/Lagrangian model for a 2D-BP to model the ﬂow pattern
that was confronted to experimental results. Further, the eﬀect of aspect ratio, relation
between column height and column width, from 1 to 11 has been studied. First, they
observed ﬂow transition for aspect ratios in a range from 1 to 3. Secondly, they revealed
that at 7.7 and higher aspect ratios, ﬂow structure was found to consist of two diﬀerent
regions. In the upper part bubbles are dispersed over the entire cross section of the
bubble column and vortices do not appear. In the lower part a clear bubble plume
was observed. Some years later Diaz et al. (Diaz et al., 2006) also investigated ﬂow
transitions for low aspect ratios and proposed ﬁgure I.5 to illustrate diﬀerent ﬂow regimes
depending on the superﬁcial gas velocity and aspect ratio. They completed the work of
(Delnoijet al., 1997) and deﬁned three diﬀerent ﬂow regimes which were observed during
their work.
For small aspect ratios (H
W1:5) two pseudo steady ﬂow structures can be seen. At
low superﬁcial gas velocities a Single Cell Bubbly Flow (SCBF) characterized by convex
bubble trajectory and only one vortex cell, appears. The second one is called Double
Cell Transition Flow (DCTF) and has the same shape than a vertical vortex dipole, with
large upward moving bubbles in the column middle and two vortex cells, one on each
side generating downward moving bubbles on the column edges. For aspect ratios larger
thanH
W= 2an unsteady Vortical Flow (VF) is formed. This regime can be recognized by
its sinusoidal trajectory of ascending bubbles. At the column edges and close to the free

surface vortical cells are formed and their number increases with increasing aspect ratio.
Plus, bubble plumes (or vortical ﬂows) show a low-frequency oscillating behaviour. The
focus of the present investigation will be on this phenomenon in aim to better understand
its contribution to column mixing.
Figure I.5: Identiﬁcation of ﬂow structures depending on aspect ratio by Delnoij et al.
(Delnoij et al., 1997)
I.4 Oscillating Bubble Plume
Several authors like (Delnoij et al., 1997), (Rensen & Roig, 2001), (Buwa & Ranade, 2003)
and (Diaz et al., 2006) took a closer look to the low frequency of the wandering bubble
plume. For example (Mudde & Simonin, 1999) were able to reproduce bubble plume
oscillations numerically. Their results showed comparable time scales than experimental
data.
Anyway, from this moment we only consider bubble columns for aspect ratios from 3 to
7. In this way one makes sure that the aspect ratio can be left out of consideration.
(Delnoij et al., 1997) studied oscillation frequencies for superﬁcial gas velocities in the
rangefrom2mm/sto6mm/sandshowedastrongrelationbetweenthesetwoparameters.
30I.4. Oscillating Bubble Plume
With increasing superﬁcial gas velocity, plume oscillation frequency increases as well. In
our laboratory, periodic plume time scales were already investigated via optical probe
measurements by (Aouinet, H., 2016). Rensen & Roig (Rensen & Roig, 2001) found
that this frequency is persistent over the whole column height. They concluded that
the horizontal density gradient and the velocity proﬁle of the entrained liquid are the
driving terms of the unstable bubble plume behavior. One should mention that the
ascending bubble plume naturally disperses which, after a certain height, is damped by
the conﬁnement of column walls.
However, in the current investigation our focus is on the impact of ﬂuid properties. (Buwa
& Ranade, 2003) were the ﬁrst ones who used other ﬂuids than pure water in pseudo-2D
bubble columns. They pointed out that the oscillation period does not change by the
addition of saturated NaCl. This is in disagreement with (Cachaza et al., 2011) who used
NaCl to modify surface tension in order to analyze their impact on ﬂow patterns. It is
probable, that (Buwa & Ranade, 2003) did not notice any diﬀerences because of the small
superﬁcial gas velocity range (no ﬂow regime modiﬁcation) and the use of NaCl as tracer
to measure mixing times and not no modify ﬂuid properties.
To our knowledge (Cachaza et al., 2011) are the only ones who investigated the
inﬂuence of surface tension on ﬂow patterns in such pseudo-2D conﬁgurations. Fig-
ure I.6 shows ﬂow structures for three liquids with diﬀerent surface tensions, but with
almost same density and viscosity (see ﬁgure I.1) at two diﬀerent superﬁcial gas velocities.
Fluid NameDensity (kg=m3)Surface Tension ( mN=m)

CaCl 2Solution C3 1041.5 72.95
IBOH Solution C18 990.1 37.67
TABLEAU I.1: Fluid properties of surfactant solutions by Cachaza et al. (2011)
At low gas injection rate, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in ﬂow structures can be observed.
But at higher gas injection rates ﬂow regime can change from vortical (VF) to double cell
transition ﬂow (DCTF) by modifying surface tension. This result could be explained by
bubble interactions occuring much more often at high gas ﬂow rates. At low gas hold-up
almost no bubble coalescence or breakup appears independently of surface tension, only
bubble size changes slightly due to added surfactants. Therefore, the hydrodynamic
31Chapter I. Bubbly Flow
Figure I.6: Inﬂuence of surface tension by Cachaza et al. (2011)
structure remains the same. At high gas hold-up, bubble interactions become frequent.
Thus, surface tension reduction and the resulting decrease of coalescence (Ruzicka
et al., 2008) have a large inﬂuence on hydrodynamic structure. Bubble coalescence and
breakups also generate a large number of small bubbles. With decreasing bubble size,
surface forces like drag or lift became more important compared to body forces like
gravity. Hence, bubbles are trapped more easily by liquid recirculation which results
in an increasing gas hold-up becoming more and more important in time. (Cachaza
et al., 2011) concluded that reduced coalescence and increased aeration destabilize the
VF leading to a transition to DCTF. This example shows nicely the impact of liquid
properties on ﬂow regimes.
Therefore, eﬀects of ﬂuid properties on bubble plume oscillations must be taken
into account. Other properties like viscosity have to be explored because of the infor-
mation gap in the literature and their crucial role in large bubble column reactor scale-up.
32I.5. Conclusion
I.5 Conclusion
This chapter gave a short overview of bubble dynamics and bubble columns. The aim
is to show the high quantity of work dealing with isolated bubbles. Bubble character-
istics like shape, rising velocity, trajectory, etc. were investigated in detail for decades.
Furthermore, in the last 30 years a large interest was given to bubble columns because
of their importance in industries. But most of the time, only high reactors compared to
their width and with a homogeneous injection were studied.
With the increasing importance of energy consumption, large reactors where bubble
plumes appear, got in the focus of research and must also be analyzed in detail. If
one wants to understand mixing in such large tanks, one has to characterize properly non
stationary phenomena like bubble plumes. Such ﬂows show complex bubble interactions
which are still not clear, especially when it comes to liquid property inﬂuences. They
represent also a suitable academic case for the understanding of basic physical phenom-
ena between two phases concerning mass, momentum and energy transfer. Plus, bubble
plumes show local, meso- and macroscale phenomena and are therefore perfect test cases
to study multiscale mixing.

Experimental Methods & Analyzes
The present investigation is mainly experimental. Therefore, a large number of experi-
ments were performed in two diﬀerent bubble plume conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst one is a
quasi two dimensional one generated in a pseudo two dimensional bubble column sit-
uated in Toulouse, whose advantages will be explained in the following section. For a
better understanding the abbreviation 2D-BP for two dimensional bubble plume will be
used. Additional experiments in a cylindrical three dimensional were performed at the
Helmholtz-zentrum in Dresden-Rossendorf in order to study three dimensional bubble
plumes. The abbreviation 3D-BP will be used for this case.
II.1 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
II.1.1 Setup
The pseudo two dimensional bubble column used in the present investigation, is 0:06m
deep, 0:35mwide and 2mhigh. Liquid height is ﬁxed to 1:3mcorresponding to a height
to wide ratio ofH
W>3:5. In this way one can be sure that this parameter has no inﬂuence
on ﬂow regime transition for all considered injection gas ﬂow rates (as demonstrated
in section I.4). The column is made of 2cmthick plexiglass allowing the application of
visual metrological methods. Four pressure sensors (PR41X from Keller) are installed,
three on the left hand side (at top, middle and bottom of the column) and one on the
right hand side (in column middle). Furthermore, on the right hand side two oxygen
probes (OX25 from Unisense), one at the top and one at the bottom, are available. A
sketch of the bubble column can be seen in ﬁgure II.1.
35Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
Figure II.1: Experimental Setup at LISBP a) Perspective View b) Sketch
The gas injection sparger consists of seven diﬀerent injection points, all aligned
from left to the right and equally spaced. At each point one can choose between two
injection conditions, but in the present work, only central (single spot) injection is used.
Either small ellipsoidal bubbles of order of some millimeters can be generated through
a membrane sparger with a diameter of 20mmor large spherical caps of order of some
centimeters (largest distance of the bubble) can be produced via slugﬂow sparger. To
create such a slug ﬂow, 1mlong tubes with an inner diameter of 16mmwere used in
order to obtain Taylor bubbles. The last 7cm of the tubes show an enlargement to 20mm
36II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
of inner diameter due to construction reasons. The gas injection ﬂow rate is controled by
mass ﬂow meter (SLA5850S from Brooks) with an outlet pressure of 3bar.
In our whole investigation a system of coordinates is admitted where xand the associated
velocityUare in horizontal direction and yand the associated velocity Vare in vertical
direction.
II.1.2 Fluid properties
The focus of the present work is on the impact of ﬂuid properties on bubble plumes.
The goal was to simulate experimentally bioreactor ﬂuids. Therefore, a copolymer named
Breox 75W55000 from BASF is used. This copolymer shows advantaging properties like
stability in shear and time which means that the ﬂuid shows Newtonian behaviour and
can be conserved for a long time. Viscosity is measured with the Mars3 Rheometer
from Thermoﬁscher and surface tension with the 3S from GIBX. A rheogram showing
the dynamic viscosity as a function of the shear rate for the ﬂuids Breox ( 13:6%), Breox
(18:5%) and Breox ( 24%) can be seen in ﬁgure II.2.
Figure II.2: Dynamic Viscosity as a fucntion of the shear rate in diﬀerent Fluids: Breox
(13:6%) ; Breox ( 18:5%) ; Breox ( 24%)
The ﬂuid is also perfectly mixable with water which enables us to create every desired
viscosity. Plus, because of its transparency, optical metrological methods can be applied.
37Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
All ﬂuid properties depending on copolymer mass concentration are shown in table II.1.

TABLEAU II.1: Fluid properties
One was able to create a ﬂuid with the same viscosity as water, but with modiﬁed
surface tension by adding just a small quantity of the copolymer to water. In this way
surface tension could be investigated as well. By increasing the copolymer concentration
surface tension remains constant, but viscosity increases. The corresponding range of
dimensionless numbers are shown in table II.2.

Mo[10 11-10 7]
TABLEAU II.2: Ranges of Dimensionless Numbers
Low values of all three numbers correspond to ellipsoidal bubbles while the higher
limits indicate spherical caps which is in agreement with ﬁgure I.1.
II.1.3 Metrological Methods
In the case of 2D-BP ﬁve diﬀerent metrological methods are applied in order to study
hydrodynamic structures as well as oxygen mass transfer through the bubble interface.
Pressure sensors, oxygen probes and PIV measurements are used to analyse the liquid
phase. The bubbles or dispersed gas phase is examined by using shadowgraphy. Plus,
absorbance measurements were realized to determine mixing times.
II.1.3.1 Particle Image Velocity
The particle image velocity (PIV) measurement technique is an optical method to obtain
ﬂow visualizations in form of two dimensional velocity ﬁelds.
38II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
The idea is as follows: a ﬂat laser sheet illuminates a ﬂuid charged with seeding particles.
In orthogonal direction to the acquisition window (or to the laserstheet) a camera takes
image pairs with short time-interval depending on ﬂuid velocity. The images are divided
in a certain number of submatrix or interrogation areas. Next, spatial intercorrelation
is applied to every submatrix of image pairs, giving a velocity vector. Depending on
image and submatrix size, resolution can change signiﬁcantly. For more details of PIV
application in multiphase ﬂows, one refers to the article from (Lindken & Merzkirch,
2002). In our case, an adaptive PIV method which is included in the image treatment
software DynamicStudio from Dantec, is used. This method iteratively optimize the
size and shape of each interrogation area in order to adapt to local ﬂow gradients and
seeding densities. In this way, ﬁeld resolution can be improved. The acquisition window
was ﬁxed to 1600840pixels2which corresponds to 16787mm2covering half of
the column width. The right top angle of the interrogation window is just next to the
pressure sensor on the right side. The intercorrelation matrix size could be decreased to
1616pixels, the time between images was ﬁxed to 2msand the acquisition frequency
to15Hz. Rhodamin-B colored particles with size range from 1mto20mare used as
seeding particles because of their light spectrum. Indeed, the highest light absorption is
in the green range with a peak at 550nmwhile the highest emission is in the orange and
red range with peak at 590nm. Hence, a green ( 532nm) laser (Skylight from Dantec) is
used as lightsource for Rhodamin-B particle excitation. Plus, a highpass light ﬁlter (over
570nm) is installed to the camera in order to only register the emitted red light from
the particles. In this way, light reﬂections from bubble interfaces could be avoided on
PIV-images. In order to obtain a good statistic of at least 20 oscillation periods, 10000
image pairs are taken during every experiment.
II.1.3.2 Shadowgraphy
A second camera with the exact same interrogation window (as the ﬁrst one for PIV)
is used for shadowgraphy in order to analyze the gas phase. Informations about bubble
size, shape, spatial distribution and velocity are extracted. Plus, a second acquisition
window over the whole column width is used in order to perform complementary void
fraction measurements. The second window is ﬁxed to 20481280pixelscorresponding to
39Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
28:717:9cm2. One must mention that shadowgraphy is a two dimensional measurement.
Because of the high image depth of camera objectives, the whole column depth is taken
into account. This is particulary important, when it comes to void fraction calculations.
A homogeneous LED-pannel is installed behind the transparent column. The camera
registers projected shadows of each bubble on the interrogation window. Bubbles appear
as dark shadows because of the light refraction on the interface as illustrated in ﬁgure II.3.
Figure II.3: Shadowgraphy - Experimental Setup
The frequency is the same as for PIV measurements ( 15Hz) and image pairs are
taken with a time interval of 2msas well. Both cameras are perfectly synchronized.
In our investigation a blue LED-pannel (at 480nm) and a bandpass light ﬁlter (around
480nm) are used. Hence, the second camera captures only the gas phase without any
light perturbation from the PIV laser. In this way, one could make sure to focus on just
one ﬂuid at the time per camera in order to consider both phases separately. In case of
shadowgraphy 10000 images pairs are taken for the same reason than for PIV.
II.1.3.3 Image processing
Authors like (Ferreira et al., 2012), (Mikaelian et al., 2015) and others used shadowgraphy
to characterize bubble morphology in terms of size distribution and shapes in more or
40II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
less dense bubbly ﬂows. In most cases, a bubble size based ﬁlter is applied that one
wanted to avoid here. Our data treatment is supposed to be applicable to all kinds
of bubble sizes and shapes, even in bubbly ﬂows with polydispersed size distribution.
The idea is to isolate well identiﬁed bubbles (WIB) in order to extract informations like
bubble eccentricity as a function of bubble size. The second aim is to characterize bubble
interactions well enough to calculate void fractions as close as possible to reality. Hence,
an algorithm in Matlab was developed to detect all kinds of objects on shadowgraphy
images and identify their nature such as overlapping, coalescing, upbreaking and
deformed single bubbles. First of all, non homogeneities of the background light are
removed by applying a so called ﬂat on every image. The ﬂat is nothing else than a
shadowgraphy picture of the same acquisition window without any bubbles. A light ﬁlter
is used to further intensify object contours as it can be seen in ﬁgure II.4.
Figure II.4: Left: Raw Image; Right: Flat + Lightﬁlter
These contours, corresponding to projected interfaces, are then identiﬁed by searching
the highest light intensity gradients. Images can now get binarized where 0corresponds
to the liquid phase and 1to the gas phase. Possible holes inside bubbles due to light
refraction or uncorrect alignment of the light source, bubbles and the camera, must be
ﬁlled (see ﬁgure II.5).
41Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
Figure II.5: Left: Binarized Image; Right: Binarization + Hole Filling
Spatial distribution First, bubble position/distribution is used to analyze low fre-
quency oscillations, or in other words to follow the wandering bubble swarm movement.
The gravity center and the associated projected surface area of every bubble is calculated.
The gravity center of all bubbles is then calculated for every image as follows:
(xgc;ygc) =Pn
i=1(xi;yi)AiPn
i=1Ai(II.1)
where (xi;yi)is the gravity center, Aithe projected surface area of each bubble and
nthe number of bubbles. Figure II.6 shows a raw (left) and a binarized image (right).
On both, the gravity center position is indicated. By plotting the horizontal position in
time, bubble swarm motion could be followed (see ﬁgure II.7).

Left: raw image; Right: binarized image
42II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
Figure II.7: Bubble Gravity Center Position followed in time
Object Identiﬁcation Binarized images are also used to identify the nature of objects.
For two reasons it is important to separate single, so called "Well Identiﬁed Bubbles"
(WIB) from all other possible situations like overlapping, coalescence, break-ups which
will be named "Complex Situations". First, the WIBs will be used to extract statistical
informations concerning size and shape. Second, all detected objects shall be treated
correctly in order to calculate in the best manner the corresponding volume enabling us
an estimate of the global void fraction as close as possible to reality. Therefore, a series
of ﬁlters are applied to every single detected object as illustrated in ﬁgure II.8.

Figure II.9: Smallest Polygon possible projected on Binarized (left) and on Raw Image
(right)
All objects having more than 10%of their contours length belonging to the image
borders, are rejected. The resting objects are considered as uncutted.
Secondly, solidity, the proportion of pixels in a convex hull (smallest possible polygon
illustrated as blue lines in ﬁgure II.9) surrounding the considered object and its raw
projected area (white area on binarized images), in combinaison with bubble size is
checked.
Solidity =ARaw
APolygon(II.2)
The threshold of 7:5mmof the equivalent diameter is chosen empirically to adapt
solidity. For better understanding the polygons are projected on binarized and on raw
images as shown in ﬁgure II.9. For bubbles smaller than 7:5mma high solidity of 0:97is
deﬁned to make sure that only single bubbles are detected since ellipsoidal bubbles shall
be characterized in the best way possible. For large bubbles with an equivalent diameter
over 15mm, a solidity of 0:9is chosen. Projected shadows of such bubbles can show
strong deformation due to interface instabilities which results in lower solidity values.
Furthermore, overlapping of a large and a small bubble can fall in this category. This
is wanted because the generated potential error is very small. Plus, the distinguishment
between these two situations is almost impossible or would require a way more complex
44II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
image processing. However, in between the above mentioned points, the following linear
function is deﬁned to relate both thresholds:
Solidity = 0:07
7:5DE+ 0:9793 (II.3)
Under the deﬁned solidity limits, objects are classiﬁed as complex situations (COSIs).
These objects will not be used for bubble morphology characterization and treated
slightly diﬀerently for void fraction calculations which will be explained in detail in the
following paragraph.
An additional test is applied to WIBs to make sure to exclude every kind of complex
situation and take only "real" bubbles. Hence, bubble eccentricity deﬁned as the ratio
of the large and small axis of the projected ellipse (see section I.7) is used in the case
of ellipsoidal bubbles ( DE<7:5mm). For the considered bubble size range, the limiting
value of 2seems to be reasonable. If eccentricity is larger, the detected object must be
constituted of at least two overlapped bubbles and will be rejected. In the case of larger
bubbles (DE>7:5mm) bubble orientation is used to distinguish between single bubbles
and COSIs. The bubble orientation can be described by the angle between the large axis
(see section I.7) and the horizontal line. Once again to make sure to extract only WIBs,
the limiting angle was ﬁxed to 30. Over this value, objects are considered to correspond
to COSIs and are not taken into account for bubble eccentricity identiﬁcation.
Volume Calculation
The volume calculation of an ellipsodial bubble was already presented in paragraph
I.1.1. For ellipsoidal bubble shapes, the ellipse projection on bubble shadows makes
necessarily sense since it is almost the exact geometry from the side view. But what is
about the volume of spherical caps and complex situations? And how can one calculate
a volume, being three dimensional, in a correct way out of images that are only two
dimensional? And what are the errors made?
Our image treatment is based on two dimensional measurements of projected shadows. As
already presented, bubble volumes are reconstructed to determine the equivalent bubble
diameter as good as possible. Hence, our approximation must ﬁt to the two dimensional
raw areas. Therefore, the choice was made to keep the inertia moments of the projected
45Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
area. Inthissectiontheresultingareasarecomparedtoestimatepossibleerrors. Forevery

following the inertia tensor:

To estimate the errors for diﬀerent bubble-like geometrical shapes two extreme cases,
which are a hemisphere and a spherical cap with an opening angle , are considered.
Hemisphere
Let us begin with the hemisphere since this geometry is the simpler one. The inertia
moment conservation can be expressed by the following equation:
IxxEllipseIyyEllipse =IxxHemisphereIyyHemisphere (II.6)
where:
IxxHemisphere =

By using the last three equations, the following relation can be determined:
AEllipsoid = 1:029AHemisphere (II.9)
46II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
This proves that the registered two dimensional area can be considered as not modiﬁed
by our treatment in the case of an hemisphere. The maximum error made is less than
3%.
Spherical Caps
After the hemispherical shape the spherical cap one is checked. The same strategy
is used to conserve the inertia moments of the raw two dimensional area. The inertia
moments of spherical caps in the gravity center can be written as:
Ixx(r;s) =r4

(II.12)
By using the last expression and the following one:
IxxEllipseIyyEllipse =IxxCapsIyyCaps (II.13)
one obtains:
AEllipsoid =coef()ACaps (II.14)
The last equation illustrates that the error depends on the angle of the spherical cap
which is not surprising. Therefore, the coeﬃcient is plotted as a function of in ﬁgure
II.10. The ratio never exceeds the value 1:05. This means that the maximum error made
in the case of spherical caps is less than 5%.
47Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
Figure II.10: Ratio of AEllipsoidandACapsas a function of 
Complex Situations
Another error source, and probably the largest one, can derive from the volume cal-
culation of complex situations. In most cases, these situations correspond to bubble
overlapping. While in the case of single bubbles a ﬂattened sphere seems to be a good
approximation, in case of weakly overlapping bubbles one could overestimate the consid-
ered volume. For this raison, the decision is made to take rotation symmetry about the
large axisMwhich can be expressed by the following equation (Treatment 1):
VEllipsoid =4
3m2M (II.15)
In this way one makes sure not to overestimate the volume of the corresponding
object. On the other hand, this choice includes void fraction underestimations that are
more or less important depending on the injected gas ﬂow rate. However, one expects
that the truth is somewhere in between the two mentioned possibilities of COSI volume
calculation (equation I.5 (Treatment 1) and equation II.15 (Treament 2)). From now on
only Treatment 1 is considred for the experimental part of this work. An example of
ellipse projection on binarized and raw images can be seen in ﬁgure II.11. The following
discussion will be a comparison between statistical results from WIBs and COSIs. An
original way to verify image processing will be presented for two test cases.
Test Case 1: 50l
h, Water, EB
To validate our image processing two test cases are chosen. For the ﬁrst one, ellipsoidal
bubbles are injected in water through a membrane with a ﬂow rate of 50l
hgenerating an
48II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
Figure II.11: Ellipse Projection on binarized (left) and raw images (right)
almost monodisperse bubble size distribution. The low gas injection rate induces only
a small void fraction making image treatment easier. Figure II.12 shows the bubble
size distribution in the form of total gas volume (during the whole experiment) as a
function of the equivalent bubble diameter. Stars are indicating the total volume of
WIBs while dots represent COSIs. The shape of both curves are quite diﬀerent. WIBs
show an almost symmetric Gaussian distribution centered around 5mmand COSIs an
asymmetric one that is shifted towards higher values of the equivalent diameter. Since the
considered experimental case shows monodisperse size distribution without coalescence
or collapse, one concludes that COSIs can only correspond to overlapping bubbles. This
result is consistent with manual visual comparisons of raw images suggesting that our
image processing is accurate. However, at this point, the statistical volume averaged
bubble size corresponding to 5mmcan already be identiﬁed.
To further validate our image treatment ﬁgure II.13 is plotted where solidity, orientation
and eccentricity are presented as a function of the raw projected area and the raw contour.
Every point corresponds to a single bubble and the colorbar indicates the three considered
parameters of every subﬁgure. Three lines corresponding to geometrical relations between
area and contour are drawn. The solid line, the dash dotted line and the dashed line
represents relations for a circle, an ellipse with = 2and a spherical cap with an opening
angle of 100, respectively. The corresponding equations are written as follows:

By taking a closer look to ﬁgure II.13, one recognizes that most WIBs are situated
in the region between the solid and the dash-dotted line, so between a circle and an
ellipse corresponding well to the considered bubble size range. Only in the region of
very small bubbles, data points are located under the solid line indicating small error
generation in our data processing. To understand where this uncertainty comes from, one
shall keep in mind that lines are compared to surfaces (Contour

). By deriving this relation the uncertainty can be obtained ( /1

with increasing size, which partially explains the continuous decrease of the exceeding

of the lower limit. The second error source is the length calculation of a curved line
(here contour) on a square grid as it is the case for our shadography pictures. Therefore,
the chain code is used, which were ﬁrst proposed by (Freeman, 1961) and improved
by (Groen & Verbeek, 1978). To calculate the length of a random line, the authors
suggested to use probabaility density functions applied to the Freeman code in order to
better estimate the exact length. This is done to take into account the position of two
pixels to eachother (hoizontal/vertical or diagonal) since the distances are not the same( 1
orp
2). Furthermore, a decreasing error with increasing segment number was shown. In
the following, (Proﬃtt & Rosen, 1979) investigated errors and coding eﬃciency for the
representation of lines and edges. They projected a straight line at diﬀerent angles on a
square grid and studied the generated errors and standard deviations for several encoding
schemes. These authors as well reported a decreasing behavior of the average error with
increasing segment number. Finally, (Vossepoel & Smeulders, 1982) further improved
the method and used a least-square ﬁt. The authors also presented a more sophisticated
quantization method, called Vossepoel-Smeulders Algorithm, which is implemented in
Matlab and used for the present investigation. This method underestimates slightly,
but systematically the length of horizontal and vertical pixel connections. Since the
segment number (here image resolution) play an important role in error generation, this
underestimation is more pronounced at lower bubble size values. However, with increasing
bubble size, data points come closer to the dash dotted line meaning that bubbles are
getting more and more ﬂattened or deformed. This result is quit convincing, especially if
one remebers that thousands of bubbles are presented.
Let us now check the considered ﬁlter parameters. As expected, solidity is rather constant
at high values conﬁrming the correct functioning of our ﬁrst ﬁlter. Even at higher bubble
size values, solidity is not varying much. The second parameter, eccentricity, is mainly
around a value of 1:5being in agreement with the literature for the considered bubble
size in water. This proves also the good performance of our treatment to isolate WIBs.
Furthermore, bubbles rotate and can be registered in all kinds of positions or angles to
the horizontal axis. This is the reason why orientation is checked as well. Once again,
the results seems to be consistent because determined angles are centered around 0, or
in other words in horizontal position. This is the best position to characterize bubbles
properly, which is another advantage of our data treatment.

for Complex Situations (in Water and 50 lph)
53Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
In ﬁgure II.14 the same kind of data with the already mentioned geometrical lines is
presented for COSIs. The ﬁrst observation is the low number of small bubbles, which is
coherent, since they are almost not deformable and the probability of very small overlap-
ping bubbles is low. The region characterizing elipsoidal bubbles (between solid and dash
dotted line) is almost empty as well indicating that objects from this region are already
categorized as WIBs. On the other hand, large objects are detected being loutside of
the deﬁned borders. Remembering the simple test case conditions whithout coalescence,
break-ups or large deformed bubbles, one can easily conclude that these objects can not
be single, but must be multiple overlapping bubbles. A large number is even located in
regions where shadow shapes must be very complex and therefore composed of a large
number of bubbles. To further investigate COSIs, the above mentionned parameters can
serve to get additional information. For example, a strong relation between solidity and
the contour for a given area is found. Solidity decreases lineraly with increasing contour
values in orthongonal direction to the geometrical lines illustrating the importance of this
paramter to get information about deformation in the case of bubbles. But the defor-
mation is not enough, to identify correctly object’s nature, which is why orientation is
checked as well. Obviously, no clear relation between orientation and contour/area could
be found, independantly of object’s size. The large dispersion becomes even clearer by
comparing COSI’s orientation distribution with the one of WIBs from ﬁgure II.13. In-
deed, bubble overlapping is a random event and no prefered direction exists. However, if
the parameter is used in combination with others, bubble overlapping could be seperated
from other COSIs. The third parameter, eccentricity, does not evolve much and increases
only slightly with increasing contour, but small values can be found in every region of
the ﬁgure showing that the parameter is not suﬃsant to identify objects. Besides, large
values until six are also obtained corresponding to overlapping of multiple bubbles. Again,
limiting values could be deﬁned and used in combination with other parameters in order
to distinguish overlapping from COSIs. After validating our shadowgraphy image treat-
ment, two main informations can be deducted. The ﬁrst objective was to characterize
bubble shapes properly. Therefore, eccentricity is plotted as a function of the equivalent
diameter as illustrated in ﬁgure II.15. To take into account only trustable data, the sta-
tistically relevant bubble size range from ﬁgure II.12 should be considered. The interval
from 3:5mmto6:5mmis a reasonable choice to determine bubble shapes here.
54II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
Figure II.15: Eccentricity as a function of the Equivalent Bubble Diameter in the case of
WIBs
The second objective was to obtain the void fraction proﬁle as plotted in ﬁgure II.16.
Thedash-dotted,thedottedandthesolidlinerepresenttheoverall,theCOSIandtheWIB
void fraction, respectively. Both WIBs and COSIs represent approximately half of the
global void fraction. At this point, one has to remember our choice of volume calculation
of COSIs (see section II.1.3.3). Since the corresponding void fraction represents half of the
total void fraction, the way of volume calculation is very important. The presented choice
iskeept, butitshouldbementionedthattheunderestimationislargerthanexpected. The
truth is certainly in between the two presented volume calculation possibilities. However,
it is interesting to note that in the case of COSIs, dispersion is smaller and the two peaks
are more pronounced. This result shows the connection between the local gas hold-up
and the frequency of bubble interactions. In the center and at the edges of the total void
fraction proﬁl, it is easier to extract information concerning bubble characterization.
Test Case 2: 50l
h, Breox ( 24%), CAPS
For the second test case, spherical cap bubbles are injected in Breox 24%(of mass
concentration corresponding to 100 times the viscosity of water) through a 1mlong tube.
In such viscous ﬂuids, well shaped and especially stable caps are formed. In this way,
statistical data can be extracted for the considered bubble type as shown in the following
paragraph. In ﬁgure II.17 bubble size distributions for WIBs and COSIs are presented.
The ﬁrst observation is that way more WIBs than COSIs are identiﬁed. In this case,
55Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
Figure II.16: Void Fraction Proﬁl in Horizontal Direction in the case of Water, Membrane
Injection and a Flow Rate of 50l
h
bubbles are mainly isolated while rising towards the free surface and the only bubble
interaction appearing is coalescence. This phenomenen was explained by (Bouche et al.,
2012) already mentioned in section I.1.3.4. The ﬁrst bubble induces liquid agitation,
which modiﬁes the viscous dissipation and the local pressure distribution. Bubbles are
aspirated in the wake and accelerated provoking coalescence with the ﬁrst bubble after
a certain distance. Since our interrogation window is in the column middle (only 70cm
from the bottom), the probability to register such phenomena is rather small.

Situations

mation. ThecurveofWIBsisratherGaussianlikegivingastatisticalequivalentdiameter.

for WIB (in Water and 50 lph)
57Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
Only at high values, the shape is slightly asymmetric compared to the left half. These
high values come from coalescing bubbles, which could not be ﬁltered by our treatment.
On the other hand, COSIs are centered at smaller equivalent diameter values than WIBs.
One can assume that COSI volumes are underestimated since two bubbles should have
a larger volume than a single one. This underestimation results from the way of volume
calculation (see section II.1.3.3). Furthermore, the curve representing the size distribution
of COSIs has a similar shape than COSI’s size dictribution of the ﬁrst test case. This
may help to interpret the shape of such distributions, even without ﬁltering of WIBs. In
the present case a statistical object size could have been identiﬁed anyway.
In the same way than for the previous test case, solidity, orientation and eccentricity
are plotted for both object types. Figure II.18 shows all three parameters in the case of
WIBs. Axis and geometrical lines are the same as in ﬁgure II.13. First, the position of
all bubbles compared to the deﬁned geometrical lines must be analysed. Once again the
majority of WIBs is located inside the deﬁned limits. Small bubbles are generated by the
slugﬂow sparger (used here) at the injection, at the free surface and during coalescence.
This phenomenon is furthered by the decreased surface tension compared to water. With
increasing size more and more bubbles are located close to the dashed line and even fur-
ther, whichcanbeexplainedbyﬂuidproperties. Highviscosityinduceshigherdissipation,
vorticity is damped and caps are more stable enabeling eccentricity values larger than 4.
At the top of the ﬁgure, solidity is projected and shows high values for small (almost not
deformed) bubbles and decreases with increasing size. Lower, but still reasonable large
values approaching 0:9can be explained by the moon liked shape of spherical caps in such
viscous media. Very large bubbles with high solidtiy (close to 1) are probably coalesc-
ing bubbles, which could not have been removed by our algorithm due to their spherical
shape as already mentioned above. This argument is conﬁrmed by the eccentricity being
close to 1(to a circle) for the considered data points. Furthermore, a linear evolution of
the eccentricity with increasing contour values in orthogonal direction to our geometrical
lines is observed. Hence, there is a coupling between eccentricity and bubble’s size and
contour for the considered conditions. Finally, the orientation is mostly centered around
0as for WIBs in the ﬁrst test case, which is in agreement with the straight trajectory of
such large acsending caps. High values for small areas correspond to overlapping bubbles
of very small bubbles.
58II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
FigureII.19: Solidity, OrientationandEccentricityasafunctionofRawAreaandContour
for Complex Situations (Breox ( 24%) and 50 lph)
59Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
Figure II.19 shows solidity, orietation and eccentricity for COSIs of the second test
case to further validate our image treatment. As previously, point locations are compared
to geometrical relations ﬁrst. Most of the objects are located ouside the deﬁned borders
indicating that they do not correspond to single bubbles. For small sizes, spaces between
the three lines are almost empty. To understand where the small COSIs are coming from,
one must consider our three control parameters. Their solidity is very small standing
generally for overlays. This thought is conﬁrmed by the orientations, which are far away
from 0. Plus, all these objects show very large eccentricity values revealing overlays of
more than two bubbles. Larger objects, located between the solid and the dash dotted
line, show high solidity values for COSIs. These objects were ﬁltered because of the
very low and high angles. In combination with the rather low eccentricity (almost circle
shaped), it can be assumed that theses are large almost coalesced bubbles.
Our analysis becomes more diﬃcult for large objects with higher contour values. Solidity
is low, but all angles are located around 0, which is a little surprising if one remembers
our ﬁlter of 30. Eccentricity is high with values around 5or even higher suggesting that
these COSIs do not involve two or more large coalescing bubbles. But during coalescence
in such viscous media, two phenomena were observed. When it comes to coalescence
between a large bubble followed by a small one, the ﬁrst contact appears most of the time
at the edges of the large bubbles. This phenomenon is illustrated in ﬁgure II.20.
Figure II.20: Coalescence of a large and small bubbles in Breox ( 24%)
But why are that many bubbles registered by our image treatment if coalescence is as
rare as one said in the column middle? This can be explained by the second phenomenon,
which is illustrated in ﬁgure II.21. After the ﬁrst contact, bubbles form some kinds of clus-
ters. They stay attached while rising together for a certain time before coalescing. This
can be explained by the high viscosity and therefore the high bubble stability. Depending
on the size diﬀerences of the involved bubbles, either a bouncing (for similar sizes) or a
60II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
rotative movement of the small bubble around the big one (for large size diﬀerence) was
observed. In both cases solidity decreases and eccentricity increases while keeping a hor-
izontal position. These phenomena should be investigated in detail, but are not subject
of the current work.
Figure II.21: Time Evolution of Coalescence of small and large Bubbles in Breox ( 24%)
It was shown that our algorithm is able to separate isolated bubbles (WIBs) from
complex situations (COSIs) like coalescence, cluster, bouncing and overlapping. Hence,
WIBs shape can be analysed as a function of the equivalent bubble diameter in a statisti-
cally coherent range as illutrated in ﬁgure II.22. In the size range 25mm<D E<35mm,
an eccentricity between 2:1and2:2is found, which is in agreement with the theoretical
value of 2:12for a spherical cap with an opening angle of 100.
Figure II.22: Eccentricity as a function of the Equivalent Bubble Diameter in the case of
WIBs
61Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
Furthermore, the void fraction proﬁle can be plotted as shown in ﬁgure II.23. It is
worth to mention that way more WIBs are identiﬁed than COSIs indicating the eﬃcency
of our image treatment. A very small dispersion of the considered bubble plume can be
recognized, resulting from the high viscosity, which is damping transverse movements.
One can conclude that bubbles rise on a almost straight line. The only oscillating
trajectory behaviour results from coalescing phenomena and is therefore rare.

II.1.3.4 Bubble Image Velocimetry (BIV)
To characterize bubbles completely, the rise velocity must be determined as well.
Therefore, an other algorithm was developped. As in the case of PIV, image pairs are
registered with a time interval of 2ms. This interval is imposed by the PIV or in other
words by the liquid velocity since both techniques are perfectly synchronized. In order
to get a suﬃcient velocity ﬁeld resolution with high accuracy, which means with enough
seeding particles in the interrogation matrix for spatial intercorrelation, 2mscould not
be exceeded. This makes BIV complicated because bubble velocities are smaller and
higher at the same time. Hence, another type of spatial intercorrelation must be applied
to bubble image pairs.
62II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
First, a ﬂat is applied to every image in the exact same way than for object
identiﬁcation to remove possible heterogeneities in the background. Besides, light
gradients (contrasts) are slightly intensiﬁed improving image treatment. Then obejects
are detected and a interrogation matrix of the same length and height is deﬁned.
The ﬁrst step after the ﬂattening is the object detection on the ﬁrst image of every pair.
Then, every object is isolated and labeled. The rectangular interrogation matrix around
the object plus its position is deﬁned and then transported to the second image. This
is illustrated in ﬁgure II.24 for two diﬀerent objects of the same image. Around the
matrix (drawn in red) a layer of 14 pixels in every direction is added to deﬁne the ﬁnal
interrogation matrix (whole image on the right handside of ﬁgure II.24) on the second
image. The size of the layer must be large enough to detect the whole object shift to the
second image, but small enough to not induce error sources by taking into account too
many other objects on the interrogation matrix.
Figure II.24: Two Examples of detected Objects + Matrix Projection from the First to
the Second Image
This strategy is applied to every single detected object on every image pair. Now,
spatial intercorrelation can be applied between the two deﬁned matrices. It is important
63Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
to point out that BIV should be applied to non-binarized images in order to improve
spatial intercorrelations. In this way, the light intensity gradient is taken into account and
even subpixel intercorrelation can be performed. Such kind of spatial intercorrelations
were developped for solar observations in order to stabilize image acquisition by (Gelly
et al., 2008).
Figure II.25: Example of Spatial Correlation Maps in 2D (left) and 3D (right)
In ﬁgure II.25 the correlation maps in two and three dimensions are plotted for the
two detected objects shown in ﬁgure II.24. A clear global maximum can be observed in
both cases. In the ﬁrst case only one global and no local maximum is found. This is
because almost no other object is present on the second interrogation matrix. In the
second case two other objects can be observed in the second interrogation matrix. Here,
it is particulary important to treat "raw" and not binarized images. Therefore, even in
the presence of two other objects generating two local maximums, a global one can be
found. This example illustrates the good performance of our algorithm. By calculating
the distance between the matrix center and the global intercorrelation maximum, one can
determine the velocity of the considered object since the time delay of 2msis ﬁxed and
known. In order to decrease calculation times the SAD method was applied. (Löfdahl,
64II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
2010) published a review paper on calculation methods of intercorrelations and compared
them. The SAD method turned out to be the fastest one.
Figure II.26: Resulting Bubble Velocity Map for one image pair
Finally, the strategy can be applied to every object on all image pairs. An example
of the resulting "velocity map" can be seen in ﬁgure II.26. Every detected object (WIB
or COSI) shows a dedicated velocity vector. This information can be coupled with the
previous object detection algorithm. Hence, velocities can also be calculated for all WIBs
and COSIs.
Figure II.27: Mean Rising Swarm Velocity in the case of CAPS and 100l
h
65Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
However, in the present study, the swarm velocity of all objects is important.
Therefore, all objects are taken into account for mean value calculations (see ﬁgure II.27).
The dots are indicating the considered curve. The problem of this strategy is that all
bubbles independently of their size have the same importance. Logically, this can cause
problems in the case of polydispersed size distribution. For example a spherical cap
bubble moves way more liquid around itself than a small one and has therefore another
impact on hydrodynamic structures. Hence, the raw two dimensional surface is taken
into account for every bubble to resolve the problem. This is done for every objects in
all spatial intervals on the horizontal axis, which can be expressed by:
Ub=NP
i=1ArawiUbi
NP
i=1Arawi(II.19)
whereUbis the resulting mean velocity of every interval. The new modiﬁed velocity
proﬁl is plotted with stars in ﬁgure II.27. A clear increase can be seen in comparison with
the standart mean velocity (dots). This is coherent since larger objects showing higher
velocities are getting more importance. These larger objects are supposed to "control"
swarm velocity and must be treated diﬀerently.
II.1.3.5 Mixing Time
Since this work is dealing with hydrodynamics and mixing, one has to talk about time
scales characterizing column mixing. Therefore, additional experiments were performed
where blue methylen dissolved in water is injected at the column side close to the bottom.
In this region, close to the sparger, plume oscillation is not developped. Hence, the initial
injection moment is independent of the bubble plume position. Light absorption of the
considered media is used to determine the moment when the steady state is reached and
the continuous phase and the dye in the column are perfectly mixed. Two white LED
panels and two cameras (Basler) are used to deﬁne two interrogation windows of the same
size ( 5cm5cm)(see ﬁgure II.28).
66II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
Figure II.28: Experimental Setup for Mixing Times Measurements - Column
67Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
Besides, blue methylen has the highest absorbance in the red color range at 650nm.
In our experiments, only 1mlis injected in a reactor of 40l, which means that the dye
is strongly diluted. Due to this very low concentration the absorbance is low as well.
To register variations anyway, one has to focus on the color range with the highest
absorbance, or in other words the red range. Therefore, high pass ﬁlters are added to
each camera to focus only on wavelengths greater than 590m(see II.29). However, in
order to get clean results, pictures without dye are aquired to get the light intensity
reference. Then, 1mlof dye is injected during 2sfor all experiments. By adding blue
methylen dye to the liquid phase, light absorption is increased and the transmitted
light intensity captured by the cameras decreases. Plus, bubbles can appear in the
interrogation window, which is why image treatment is applied to detect every object
in order to reject it. Hence, errors due to bubble presence could be avoided. Finally,
the light intensity or gray level is integrated over the whole window where only liquid is
present.
Figure II.29: Experimental Setup for Mixing Time Measurements - Absorbance
Both cameras have separate tasks. The resulting signal from the camera at the
bottom is sued to deﬁne the initial moment t0corresponding to the moment when dye
injection is beginning (see ﬁgure II.30 (top)). The second camera located close to the
68II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
free surface is used to deﬁne the ﬁnal moment tfinalwhen the continuous phase can be
considered as perfectly mixed (see ﬁgure II.30 (bottom)).

both moments:

II.1.3.6 Pressure & Oxygen sensors
Pressure sensors
Four pressure sensors (PR41X from Keller) are installed at column edges. On the
left handside three sensors are distributed over the whole column height at 30cm,55cm
and80cmfrom the free surface, plus a fourth one on the rigth handside at 55cm. The
acquisition frequency is 1000Hz. Hence, one is able to observe pressure ﬂuctuations in the
liquid phase at diﬀerent positions of the column. All sensors are synchronized enabling
a joint analysis of all pressure signals. Intercorrelations between the diﬀerent signals can
be performed, but will not be discussed in the present investigation.
Oxygen probes
Furthermore, two oxygen probes (OX25 Fast from Unisense), at the right colum side
near top and bottom of the column are available permitting local measurements of the
dissolved oxygen concentration in the liquid phase. Thus, the thermodynamic equilib-
rium of oxygen and nitrogen is used to get knowledge about mass transfer through the
bubble interface. To provoke such a mass transfer, compressed air and nitrogen injec-
tion is used to oxygenate and deoxygenate the liquid phase, respectively. During these
processes, ﬂuctuations in dissolved oxygen concentration representing characteristic time
scales similar to bubble swarm oscillations, could be recorded. One should mention that
the response time of 0:5scauses higher ﬁltering than for the other metrological methods.
Plus, characteristic mass transfer time scales describing the global mass ﬂux through the
bubble interface can be studied. First, nitrogen is injected to deoxgenate the liquid phase
completely. Then the gas injection can be changed from nitrogen to oxygen while keeping
the exact same ﬂow rate to not disturb the hydrodynamic structure. By following the
oxygen concentration in time, the kLacan be determined (see ﬁgure II.31):
C(t) =C0+ (C? C0) exp( kLat) (II.21)
whereCcorrespond to the instantaneous, C0to the initial (close to 0) andC?to the
ﬁnal (satured) oxygen concentration. The following equation can be deduced:

In this way the exponential curve is tranformed into a linear one making an interpola-
tion much easier. The slope of the curve represents then the kLa. Finally, a characteristic
transfer time scale ccan be deducted by calculating the inverse of the kLavalue:
c=1

II.1.4 3D Bubble Plume (3D-BP)
This section is dedicated to three dimensional cylindrical bubble columns for the simple
reason that such conﬁgurations are closer to industrical applications. The main idea of
our work is the understanding of macro-mixing in large tanks, which are of course three
dimensional as well. Therefore, during this project, complementary experiments were
performed at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf.
II.1.4.1 Setup
A three dimensional cylindrical bubble column with an inner diameter of 392mmand a
height of 1:8mis made out of large PVC tubes as it can be seen in ﬁgure II.32. In the
same way than for the 2D conﬁguration, four pressure sensors (PR41X from Keller) are
71Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
installed at column walls. Three of them are located at a height of 0;78mseparated by
an angle of 120and a fourth one at a height of 1:22mvertically aligned with one of the
ﬁrst three ones. In this way spatial intercorrelations between the diﬀerent sensors can be
done. Furthermore, the Wire-Mesh system, which will be presented in the next section,
is installed at a height of 1;38mwith a spatial resolution of 6464. The mesh size is
6:125mm6:125mm. At the column bottom, a single oriﬁce located in the center of the
injection plate is used for bubble injection. In order to compare easily the results from
2D and 3D conﬁgurations, the exact same gas sparger system is installed. In this way
one is able to choose between a membrane and slugﬂow injection like it is the case for
the experiments in Toulouse at the LISBP (see section II.1). To control the injection ﬂow
rate a mass ﬂowmeter (FMA-2608A-BAR) from Omega is used.
Figure II.32: Experimental Setup at HZDR a) Picture b) Sketch
II.1.4.2 Wire-Mesh
The Wire-Mesh system recently developped by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-
Rossendorf (HZDR) is a metrological device permitting the measurement of local gas
holdups. The system is made of two gride layers. Each layer is composed of 16,32,64
72II.1. 2D Bubble Plume (2D-BP)
or128wires parallel to each other. Both layer directions are orthogonal to each other
and4mmspaced in vertical direction. In the ﬁrst layer, wires are used as emitters and
in the second one as receivers. In this way an electric potential between both layers is
created. Since this potential is constant, the resulting electric current is proportionnal
to the electric resistance and therefore to the conductivity of the ﬂuid. For additional
information on the system we refer the reader to (Silva et al., 2007). Finally, ﬂuid
conductivity is modiﬁed by the presence of gas bubbles. After calibration one can go
the other way around and is able to deduce the local gas hold up from the measured
conductivity at each crossing point.
Figure II.33: Sketch of Wire-Mesh System
Dimensions and geometry can be adapted to experimental conditions. In our case,
the grid of 6464is covering the whole horizontal cross section of the cylindrical bubble
column (see section I). In this way, the local time resolved gas hold up in the total
horizontal cross section can be obtained. The mesh size was 6:125mm6:125mmand
wires are made of 200mthick steel to be as less intrusive as possible.

II.2 Time Series Analysis
The aim of the present investigation is to ﬁnd periodic behaviours, which could either fur-
ther or hinder bubble column mixing. Therefore, diﬀerent strategies can be applied, such
as spectral analysis from the so called power spectrum (Fourier Transformation (FT)), the
autocorrelation function or the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). First two ones
can be used to obtain characteristic time scales while the POD can give additional infor-
mation concerning eddy structures and energy dissipation from PIV images. All methods
can be applied to any time resolved signal, which will be expressed by x(t), in order to
ﬁnd at least one characteristic frequency. Depending on the order of magnitude, frequen-
cies can be related to diﬀerent kind of phenomena of diﬀerent spatial scales. (Drahoš
et al., 1991) investigated for characteristic pressure ﬂuctuations in bubble columns. The
authors were able to categorize frequency ranges corresponding to phenomena like bubble
formation, passages, coalescence, liquid-level ﬂuctuations as well as large and medium-
scale eddies. For this reason frequencies of order 10 2Hzcorresponding to large eddies
are of special interest for this work since one wants to know if they further bubble column
mixing. In our case, large eddies correspond to the oscillating bubble plume motion. An
example of a pressure signal in the case of membrane injection in water with a ﬂow rate
of50l
his presented in ﬁgure II.34. The top image corresponds to a non-centered pressure
signal. By considering the hydrostatic pressure, which is close to 30mBar, one deduces
a water depth close to 30cmfrom the free surface. In order to get clean results, one
should subtract the mean value to analyse only signal ﬂuctuations via the methods being
presented in this section.
II.2.1 Spectral Analysis
A classical way to extract characteristic time scales, or frequencies, from time series is the
Fourier Transformation (FT) as expressed by the following equation:
Ps(w) =jF(w)2j=j1
2Z1
 1x(t)exp( iwt)dtj2(II.24)
where
w= 2f (II.25)

h; dotted line = raw signal ; solid line = ﬁltered signal; a) pressures signal b) pressure
ﬂuctuations
The basic idea of Fourier Transformation is to decompose time series functions into
their frequencies, or in other words, to represent time functions in the frequency domain.
The power spectra as a function of frequencies can be plotted as in ﬁgure II.35. More
often a frequency is registered, larger its energy amplitude will be. For more detailed
informations, we refer the reader to the book from (Chatﬁeld, C., 1984). At this point,
the decision was made to rather show a concrete example instead of explaining the
mathematical background. In ﬁgure II.35 the FT of the ﬂuctuation signal shown in
ﬁgure II.34 is plotted where two clear peaks can be identiﬁed. The peaks are situated at
0:0354Hzand0:0709Hzmeaning that the second peak indicates exactly half the period
of the ﬁrst one. This result is in total agreement with time signal observations. A ﬁrst
characteristic frequency of 0:0354Hzresulting from large peaks could be determined. In
addition, smaller peaks of the signal from ﬁgure II.34 generate in combination with the
large ones a second characteristic frequency of 0:0709Hz. Since the oscillating behaviour
does not change during the whole measurement, two clear peaks of similar amplitude
appear.

II.2.2 Autocorrelation
An other eﬃcient way to extract periodic time scales from any temporal signal (or mea-
surement with N points) is the autocorrelation coeﬃcient, which can be expressed as
follows:

t=1(x(t) x)(x(t+) x)PN

wherex(t)can be any signal at time t,xis the corresponding time averaged value and
the time lag. The autocorrelation scalar can be plotted as a function of any possible
time lag. The coeﬃcients corresponding to the statistically most important lag shows
peaks as it can be seen in ﬁgure II.36. Again, instead of describing in detail the mathe-
matical background, the decision was made to rather show a concrete example. For more
information, we refer the reader again to the book from (Chatﬁeld, C., 1984). Similar to
the FT, two diﬀerent characteristic time scales can be determined. The lag between the
origin and the ﬁrst peak indicates a periodic time scale of 14:1s. The diﬀerence between
the origin and the second one shows exactly two times this value, which means 28:2s. By
76II.2. Time Series Analysis
regarding the signal from ﬁgure II.34, one can say that small and large peaks correspond
to the ﬁrst and second autocorrelation peak, respectively. These two timescales coincide
perfectly with the results from the FT. But in contrast to the FT, the autocorrelation
gives additional information via the amplitudes, which are similar to those from the
original time series signal. In conclusion, it does worth it to apply the autocorrelation
function in addition to the FT for two reasons. First, a comparison can validate FT
results and secondly, complementary information in terms of amplitudes can be extracted.

II.2.3 Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is a powerfull tool to extract diﬀerent
scales in time and space from experimental or numerical data to get more information,
especially concerning spatial ﬁelds. The technique gives orthogonal bases for the
modal decomposition of an ensemble of functions. These functions can be data from
experimental acquisitions like PIV measurements or from direct numerical simulations
(DNS) or 1D signals from pressure sensors for example. In the current project, POD is
applied to PIV ﬁelds in the case of 2D-BP only.
77Chapter II. Experimental Methods & Analyzes
The main advantage is the extraction of supplementary informations in space and
time via a linear procedure out of a set of instantaneous ﬁelds. At this moment one
must mention that the POD technique does not serve in every case. Only hydrodynamic
structures (mean ﬂow, meso-scale eddies, turbulence) of signiﬁcant energy diﬀerences
can be distinguished and then analysed in detail to understand their contribution to the
overall ﬂow regime. Multiscaling phenomena depending on the kinetic energy level of each
decomposed mode can so be studied. (Lumley, 1967) proposed that coherent structures
like mean ﬂow or large eddies in turbulent ﬂow should be those with the largest mean
squareprojectiononthevelocityﬁeld. (Berkooz et al., 1993)illustratedthedecomposition
of instantaneous velocity ﬁelds. In the two dimensional case, the decomposition on the
above mentioned orthogonal bases can be written as follows:
~Vk(x;y;t ) =1X
n=1~V(n)
k(x;y;t ) =1X
n=1a(n)
k(t)~(n)(x;y) (II.27)
where~Vkis the k-th instantaneous velocity ﬁeld and ~Vn
kthe n-th component of the
POD decomposition. Every velocity ﬁeld component can further be decomposed into
temporal scalars an
k(t)and time independent spatial modes ~n(x;y). In this way, time
and spatial information are separated and decomposed depending on their energy level.
Furthermore, (Sirovich, 1987) adapted the Fredholm eigenvalue integral equation to:
Z Z Z
Rij(x;y;x0;v0;t;t0)n(x0;y0)dx0dy0dt0=(n)(t)~(n)(x;y)(II.28)
whereRij,nand~ncorrespond to the cross-correlation tensor, the eigenvalues
and the eigenfunctions, respectively. The tensor Rijcontains all spatial and temporal
informations and is build in the following manner. First a velocity ﬁeld is considered:

By using equation II.28 the resulting eigenvalue problem can now be solved. One must
mention that the eigenvectors of equation II.28 have no dimension. Only the eigenvalues
show the dimension (m4
s2). Once they are multiplied to the considered surface ( dxdy), the
eigenvalues are proportional to the kinetic energy corresponding to the dimension (m2
s2).
Anyway, by organizing all eigenvalues depending on their kinetic energy in decreasing
order, ﬂow structures can be identiﬁed. Most of the time the ﬁrst eigenvalue shows much
higher energy distribution and corresponds to the mean ﬂow. Eigenvalues with lower
energy correspond to coherent structures like large eddies. If they are close in terms of
energy, they correspond in general to the same ﬂow structure. (Liné et al., 2013) showed
a nice ﬂow structure decomposition in water and in shearthinning ﬂuids. The authors
were able to identify mean ﬂow, secondary structures, ternary structures until turbulence.
Plus, relations between diﬀerent modes in terms of time and energy scales are presented.
Once eigenvalues and eigenvectors are properly determined, instantaneous velocity ﬁelds
can be projected on the obtained eigenfunctions ~ngiving us the POD coeﬃcients an

In the other way around, the instantaneous ﬁelds can be reconstructed corresponding

Hence, it is easier to understand the contribution of every ﬂow component by
reconstructing the corresponding velocity ﬁeld or ﬂuctuations.

Experimental Results
The beginning of this chapter deals with the oscillating behaviour of bubble plumes,
including inﬂuences of injection conditions and liquid properties. Afterwards, the two
diﬀerent phases are analyzed separately in detail. The gas phase is studied via bubble’s
shape, size and velocity to determine void fractions. Concerning the liquid, besides
average values, special attention is given to ﬂuctuations. Characteristic time scales for
mass transfer and mixing are shown and a comparison between two and three dimensional
low frequency oscillations is done using the results from the Wire-Mesh system of the
HZDR.
III.1 Oscillation Frequency
III.1.1 Water
Our ﬁrst step was to make sure that bubble swarm’s oscillating motion can be captured
by diﬀerent measurement techniques in both phases showing same periodic time scales
for same injection conditions and ﬂuid properties. For this reason, a certain number of
experiments are realised in water for three diﬀerent injection ﬂow rates and two diﬀerent
spargers. Both parameters and associated superﬁcial gas velocities can be seen in table
III.1. The superﬁcial gas velocity is deﬁned by the expression:

Spectral analysis is applied to acquired data from pressure and dissolved oxygen
concentration measurements as well as from velocity to time signals obtained by PIV
measurements in one point. The aim is to quantify low frequency oscillations of the
wandering bubble plume in the liquid phase. To conﬁrm our results shadowgraphy is
applied on the gas phase in order to follow the gravity center position in time. Figure

diﬀer. Small peaks in ﬁgure III.1 a), b) and d) result from vortex cell passages. In table

experimental conditions are listed.

hydrodynamic structures with similar time scales. Besides, small ﬂuctuations of the
dissolved oxygen concentration could be measured by the two oxygen probes. This is
particulary interesting for the current investigation if one takes a closer look to the signal
from the probe at column bottom. As already mentioned, these ﬂuctuations result from
vortex cells, which are created at column top, descend along column edges before dissi-
pating at the bottom. These vortex cells contain more or less oxygen, depending on the
injected gas inducing the observed ﬂuctuations. One should mention the corresponding
signals require a more important data treatment generating less precise results. Plus, the
response time of the oxygen sensors is much higher than for pressure sensors as mentioned
in section II.1.3.6. However, our results prove that the same low frequency can be veriﬁed
by four diﬀerent metrological methods. This information can be usefull for industrial
applications to get knowledge of meso and macroscopic structures contributing to mixing
inside bioreactors. Furthermore, close, but slightly diﬀerent characteristic time scales
are measured for the two diﬀerent spargers. Both show the same decreasing time scale
evolution with increasing gas injection rate. Diﬀerences, especially for low gas ﬂow rates,
can be explained by bubble size and the resulting terminal bubble velocity (see (Clift
et al., 1978)). This velocity seems to play an important role in bubble plume oscillations.
At the highest considered injection ﬂow rate, the appearance of larger bubbles due to
coalescence in the case of the membrane sparger and the appearance of smaller bubbles
created at the outlet of the slugﬂow sparger, generates similar polydisperse bubble size
distributions. Therefore, almost identical time scales for both spargers are measured.
III.1.2 Liquid Property Inﬂuences
In the following section, inﬂuences of viscosity and surface tension are analyzed. A
copolymer, called Breox from BASF, is used to create diﬀerent ﬂuid properties. By
adding a small quantity of Breox (0.5 % of mass concentration) to deionized water, one
is able to produce a ﬂuid with same viscosity as water, but a decreased surface tension
by 25%. With increasing mass concentration, surface tension remains constant, but a
large range of diﬀerent viscosities can be obtained. The exact ﬂuid properties are shown
in table II.1.

liquids for diﬀerent injection ﬂow rates and both spargers/bubble types; EB = Ellipsoidal
bubbles; CAPS = Spherical caps
III.1.2.1 Surface tension
A comparison between two liquids with same viscosity and density, but diﬀerent surface
tensions is done for both spargers and three gas ﬂow rates. The characteristic time
scales for all 12 measurements can be seen in table III.3. One can recognize that the
inﬂuence of surface tension on ﬂow pattern is almost negligible in case of large spherical
caps and low injection ﬂow rate. At the highest considered gas ﬂow rate, the impact of
surface tension on bubble plume oscillation becomes more important. This result can be
explained by more frequent bubble interactions being in agreement with (Cachaza et al.,
2011) (see section I.4).
In case of the membrane sparger the impact of surface tension is diﬀerent. At the lowest
gas ﬂow rate, time scale diﬀerence is important because bubble interaction is already
frequent without appearance of coalescence or breakups. Plus, the modiﬁed bubble size
due to surface tension decrease involves a modiﬁcation of the terminal bubble velocity.
At the highest ﬂow rate, large bubbles appear and bubble size distribution becomes
polydisperse and similar to slugﬂow sparger conditions at high ﬂow rate. Only in the case
of an injection rate of 100l=h, the characteristic time scale is not modiﬁed. Probably,
two diﬀerent phenomena appear and compensate themself. First one is the modiﬁed
bubble size distribution and therefore modiﬁed terminal velocities. The second one
is bubble interaction including coalescence. However, surface tension shows the high-
est inﬂuence in situations where bubble interactions are frequent, but without coalescence.
85Chapter III. Experimental Results
III.1.2.2 Viscosity
In the following section, the viscosity eﬀect is in focus. Therefore, comparisons are done
between the diﬀerent Breox ﬂuids since surface tension and density are constant for all of
them. Like in the previous section, all characteristic time scales can be seen in table III.3.
Furthermore, results are presented in graphical form in ﬁgure III.2. In case of membrane
sparger injection, a clear tendency is recognized. For all injection ﬂow rates characteristic
time scales are decreasing with increasing viscosity in a range from 1mPa:sto20mPa:s.
If viscosity further increases up to 52mPa:stime scales increase again for all considered
injection ﬂow rates.
Figure III.2: Characteristic time scales in function of viscosity for three diﬀerent injection
ﬂow rates in case of a) membrane sparger and b) slugﬂow sparger
This observation results from the appearance of larger bubbles. Indeed, the high
viscosity provokes bubble coalescence generating large spherical caps. This phenomenon
has also been observed in case of homogeneously aerated 3D bubble columns (Olivieri
et al., 2013), (Besagni et al., 2017). For a better understanding, raw images from
shadowgraphy are shown in ﬁgure III.3. Projected bubble shadows in Breox with
86III.1. Oscillation Frequency
mass concentrations of 8.7% and 18.5% at low and high gas injection rate through the
membrane sparger can be seen. At low gas injection rate (ﬁgure III.3 a) and c)) bubble
size distribution is almost monodisperse. At higher gas ﬂow rates, larger bubbles are
formed at the sparger and bubble size distribution becomes polydisperse. Therefore, an
attenuation of the decreasing time scales was observed at higher viscosities. The bubbles
formed by coalescence become larger with increasing viscosity, which also increases
characteristic time scales. This fact illustrates the coupling between bubble size, the
associated terminal bubble velocity and the wandering plume motion.
Figure III.3: Images from shadowgraphy in case of membrane sparger, a) Breox(8,7%)
and 50 l/h b) Breox(8,7%) and 200 l/h c) Breox(18,5%) and 50 l/h d) Breox(18,5%) and
200 l/h
A remarkable result is the insensitivity of the oscillating motion to viscosity in case
of spherical caps. For the considered viscosity range characteristic time scales remain
unchanged. This can be explained by low bubble interaction rates as well as by bubble
size and therefore bubble’s terminal velocity, which do not change much. This is another
indication of the strong coupling between the low frequency oscillation and the terminal
bubble velocity. Indeed, the vertical void fraction gradient, which is directly dependent
on the rising velocity and the dispersion, seems to have great impact on the wandering
motion. This argumentation is in line with the Brunt-Väisälä frequency, which is an
87Chapter III. Experimental Results
unstability oscillation due to density stratiﬁcation.
In the case of Breox ( 18:5%) and the slugﬂow sparger no clear frequency could be
identiﬁed any more. Both spargers show transition from VF to DCTF for the highest
considered viscosity of 100mPa:sand all injection ﬂow rates. Furthermore, dispersion
decreases with increasing viscosity for both spargers and all considered gas ﬂow rates. In
other words, the increasing viscosity amortizes the amplitude of the oscillating bubble
swarm wave. This information can be usefull to determine distances between spargers in
large tanks depending on viscosity and the sparger.
A last aspect, which should at least be mentioned is the appearance of microbubbles due
to the low surface tension. During certain experiments, bubble coalescence, break-ups
and injection generate microbubbles. The phenomen goes on until saturation, which
takes place after some minutes. This may change the eﬀective mixture viscosity but
because of the diﬃculties to measure last one, the parameter is not investigated in detail.
III.1.3 Dimensionless numbers
In this section dimensionless numbers are used to compare our work to others. In litera-
ture, (Caballina et al., 2003) suggested to take the following Grashof number expression:
Gr=gL3
iUGS
2Ub1(III.2)
wheregis the gravity constant, Lithe inlet length, UGSthe superﬁcial gas velocity, 
the kinematic viscosity and Ub1the terminal bubble velocity. The Grashof number was
ﬁrst introduced for thermally induced plumes, but works also for other two dimensional
bubble plums in case of water. The second number generally used for bubble plume
characterization is the Strouhal number:
St=fLi
UGS(III.3)
wherefis the oscillating plume frequency, Lithe inlet length and UGSthe superﬁcial
gas velocity. (Rensen & Roig, 2001) used this number in order to categorize bubble plume
oscillations in heterogeneously aerated bubble columns. They deﬁned it as normalized
frequency.
88III.1. Oscillation Frequency
Figure III.4: Strouhal number in function of Grashof number
In ﬁgure III.4 a good agreement between our results in water and the results
from (Diaz et al., 2006), (Pﬂeger et al., 1999) and (Becker et al., 1994) can be seen.
Unfortunately, these two numbers do not seem to take into account the viscosity in the
right way. In case of Breox ( 8:7%) having a viscosity 10 times higher than the other
experiments performed in water, a diﬀerence of two decades is observed. Because of the
power two in the Grashof expression, viscosity inﬂuence is much more important than in
the Strouhal number expression. This is also the case for the Rayleigh number, which is
often used as well (Rensen & Roig, 2001).
It can be concluded that at least one of these numbers must be modiﬁed to take into
account viscosity in a diﬀerent way. We noticed that both dimensionless numbers are
mainly based on bubble column characteristics, but during our experiments one observed
that bubble size and shape have also large inﬂuence on bubble plume oscillations.
Therefore, bubble properties like size and shape and thus indirectly ﬂuid properties
like surface tension and viscosity (Clift et al., 1978) should be taken into consideration.
To our mind one of the dimensionless numbers should be directly based on bubble
characteristics. Our suggestion is to use the Froude number, which is comparing ﬂow
inertia and gravity eﬀects, deﬁned as follows:
89Chapter III. Experimental Results
Fr=UGSpgDE(III.4)
whereDEis the equivalent bubble diameter and gthe gravity constant.
Figure III.5: Strouhal number as a function of Froude number
In ﬁgure III.5 the Strouhal as a function of the Froude number is plotted. A decreasing
asymptotic evolution of the Strouhal number with increasing Froude number can be
observed. One has to mention that in case of high viscosity and/or high injection ﬂow
rate, bubble size distribution becomes bimodal. For this reason, two Froude numbers
based on diﬀerent equivalent bubble diameters are calculated for one single experiment,
or in other words for one single Strouhal number. Our results suggest that large bubbles,
corresponding to low Froude numbers and presenting the highest terminal velocity, are
predominantly inﬂuencing low frequency oscillations. Finally, we have to admit that our
suggestion still needs improvements, but the strategy to base at least one dimensionless
number on bubble size and shape to take into account ﬂuid properties seems to make
sense. Additionally, the choice of the considered velocity describing the phenomenon
should be discussed. In literature, it is generally admitted to use UGSconsidering bubble
column dimensions and gas injection ﬂow rate. However, the sliding or terminal bubble
velocity could eventually provide better results.

TABLEAU III.4: Bubble Characterization for a large range of experimental conditions
In table III.4, the convergent equivalent diameters of WIBs and COSIs are listed.
Characteristic sizes are shown for diﬀerent injection conditions and in diﬀerent ﬂuids.
As expected with membrane injection, all COSIs show larger mean bubble diameter
than WIBs. Last ones are identiﬁed as single bubbles while COSIs consist of multiple
overlapping bubbles, which are consequently larger. Even the diﬀerent ways of volume
calculation between WIBs and COSIs do not change this tendency. The same observation
isdonefortheslugﬂowspargerinwaterandBreox( 0:5%). WhileWIBscorrespondtowell
deﬁned spherical caps, COSIs represent mostly up breaking or coalescing bubbles creating
very large and complex object shapes. Considering the slugﬂow sparger in more viscous
ﬂuids, COSIs show lower diameter values than WIBs. In these experimental conditions,
object’s shapes are less complex implying that WIBs and COSIs are more similar. Hence,
91Chapter III. Experimental Results
the manner of volume calculation (see section II.1.3.3) becomes important, which is why
smaller diameter values are found for COSIs. However, WIBs are used to determine
eccentricity as a function of the equivalent bubble diameter in diﬀerent ﬂuids. An increase
factor of 1:2is chosen to deﬁne size intervals depending on the equivalent bubble di-
ameter. After image treatment, the median eccentricity value is calculated for all of them.
Figure III.6: Eccentricity and Bubble Size Distribution as a function of the Equivalent
Diameter in Water
In ﬁgure III.6 eccentricity values for six diﬀerent injection conditions are plotted. In
the range between 2mmand10mmall measurements ﬁt very well. The six curves merge
perfectly. The small gap around 8mmresults from a ﬁlter of our image treatment and
is present on all ﬁgures. Anyway, at higher diameter values, results begin to disperse.
Therefore, bubble size distributions, illustrated at the bottom of the ﬁgure, must be taken
into account to chose data points at best. For example, the most accurate results for
92III.2. Bubble Characterisation
larger bubbles are determined in the case of slugﬂow injection at 50l
hand100l
h. In this
way, one makes sure to not take into acount WIB results from too dense bubbly ﬂows,
being eventually inﬂuenced by COSIs, which could not be ﬁltered by our treatment.
However, the two mentioned injection conditions give statistically valuable results in a
coherent size domain. Diamonds and Triangles (as marker) should be considered for
eccentricity determination in the case of such large bubbles. Values around 2are found
in the corresponding size range. Surprisingly, at even higher bubble sizes, eccentricity
decreases again. These results may be inﬂuenced by COSIs, which could not be ﬁltered,
because of the rather low number of very large objects. Indeed, very large objects are
most of the time coalescing or collapsing since no stable shape exist any more.
Figure III.7: Eccentricity and Bubble Size Distribution in function of the Equivalent
Diameter in Breox ( 0:5%)
93Chapter III. Experimental Results
In water the most coherent results are found for rather low injection ﬂow rates. Hence,
the smallest one is chosen to investigate eccentricity for the other ﬂuids. In ﬁgure III.7
eccentricity (top) and bubble size distribution (bottom) are plotted for Breox ( 0:5%) at
50l
h. As in water, image processing seems to furnish good results in the lower size range.
With increasing size, results begin to disperse again, which another time can be explained
by the unstable behaviour of large bubbles. This phenomenon is even furthered by the de-
creased surface tension because of the destabilizing eﬀect on the interface. This is also the
reason why the equivalent diameter for both, WIBs and COSIs, are smaller than in water.
Figure III.8: Eccentricity and Bubble Size Distribution as a function of the Equivalent
Diameter in Breox ( 13:6%)
In ﬁgure III.8 bubble shapes in Breox ( 13:6%) are studied. Again, eccentricity and
size distribution are shown. In contrast to the last two cases, more attention must be
94III.2. Bubble Characterisation
given to the size distribution. Only in the range of very small bubbles around 3 4mm
and very large ones around 30mm, eccentricity should be considered. In membrane
sparger conditions, most of the detected objects correspond to COSIs. Hence, the
discontinuous evolution of the eccentricity between 5mmand 8mmis not physical.
However, eccentricity increases between 10mmand15mm, reaches a maximum value of
2:2and decreases for larger sizes. This evolution is quit similar to the results in water.
Besides, points are less dispersed indicating a more stable bubble interface.
Figure III.9: Eccentricity and Bubble Size Distribution as a function of the Equivalent
Diameter in Breox ( 18:5%)
The same data is also shown in ﬁgure III.9 and analyzed for Breox ( 18:5%). Regarding
the bubble size distribution, a bi-modal shape can be recognized. This means that in the
case of the membrane sparger, ellipsoidal bubbles are mainly taken into account while
95Chapter III. Experimental Results
the slugﬂow sparger generates only spherical caps. Both bubble types show rather stable
interface behaviour. In the statistically relevant size range a clear eccentricity evolution
can be seen. With increasing size, eccentricity increases, but less than in the above
considered ﬂuids. For very large bubbles, a decreasing slope can be recognized as in the
case of Breox ( 13:6%).
Figure III.10: Eccentricity and Bubble Size Distribution as a function of the Equivalent
Diameter in Breox ( 24%)
Last but not least, eccentricity is also investigated in the most viscous of our ﬂuids.
The slope of the curve in the lower size range increases slightly less compared to the
other ﬂuids. At this point, one can already conclude that with increasing viscosity, more
stable and therefore less ﬂattened ellipsoidal bubbles are formed. In the case of spherical
caps, similar values than in the other ﬂuids are found, but decrease less with increasing
96III.2. Bubble Characterisation
size. Well shaped and stable bubbles could be observed during the experiments. The
dispersion of the results is very slow and the quantity of WIB very high. Hence, these
results are particularly trustable.
Figure III.11: Statistical Eccentricity as a function of the Eötvös Number
Anyhow, the Eötvös number is used to plot eccentricity of all considered ﬂuids on
a single graphe as shown in ﬁgure III.11. Our results are compared to equation I.20
from (Wellek et al., 1966). It can be seen that the agreement with our experimental
data is acceptable for low Eötvös numbers, but not for high ones. One must point out
that III.11 is valid for an isolated object and not for an ensemble as in the present case.
This is also the main argument to explain the gap, especially at high Eötvös numbers.
Bubbles interact with eachother and instability wakes are generated, which inﬂuence
the pressure distribution around the bubbles making the shape very unstable. This
means that bubbles do not rise in a stagnant ﬂow where the pressure distribution would
be symmetric around the axis of revolution (from bubble top to its tail). Here, they
experience disturbances from liquid agitation making them oscillate. Therefore, bubbles
deform from ﬂattened spheroids to spheres and back again, reducing the statistical
eccentrcity. A second reason for the observed gap is a small overestimation of the short
axis and implying a small underestimation of the eccentricity. This error results from the
fact that bubbles are observed in diﬀerent positions, even after applying our "orientation"
97Chapter III. Experimental Results
ﬁlter limiting the range to [  30;30]. Anyway, WIB could be separated from COSIs
and used for bubble characterization in bubble swarms. Clear tendencies with increasing
size could be identiﬁed and viscosity as well as surface tension show eﬀects on bubble
size and shape. While surface tension generates smaller bubbles and destabilizes the
interface, viscosity has a stabilizing eﬀect on last one.
Finally, we suggest equation III.5 for the eccentrcitiy as a function of the Eötvös number
in order to summarize our experimental results. To our knowledge, no work investigating
the statistical shape of bubbles inside a swarm, exists in literature. In this way, our
bubble characterization can be compared to future results. The equation is obtained by
using the nonlienear last squares (NLLS) Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm.

III.3 Bubble Dispersion
After this bubble characterization, bubble swarm dispersion is investigated, because
injection conditions as well as liquid properties have not only an impact on the oscillation
frequency, but also on the plume width, which is an important point when it comes to
reactor scale-up including sparger distances. Turbulent interactions between bubbles, but
also large eddies at the mesoscale play an important role in plume dispersion. One wants
to ﬁnd out, which one is the driving phenomenon. Again sparger types, surface tension
and viscosity are investigated. Both liquid properties can signiﬁcantly modify bubble
interactions like collisions with and without coalescence, but also the dynamic of large
eddies. Hence, void fraction proﬁles in diﬀerent ﬂuids and for both spargers are studied.
To better understand these averaged void fraction proﬁles a time resolved example is
show in ﬁgure III.12. The mean void fraction at diﬀerent moments corresponding to
multiples of the semi-period, is plotted ( t= [0:5P;1P;2P;3:5P]). Att= 0the proﬁle is
an instantaneousus one. The other proﬁles are averaged on more and more periods, which
makes them more and more ﬂattened in time. After several periods the two characteristic
peaks for the present case can be observed. In the following, the void fraction proﬁle do
not vary much any more.
98III.3. Bubble Dispersion
Figure III.12: Evolution of the mean void fraction proﬁle in time in the case of Water
membrane sparger and 50l

III.3.1 Water
The following void fraction proﬁles are averaged over the whole measurement time mean-
ing that at least 25 periods are taken into account. In ﬁgure III.13 the proﬁles in the case
of the membrane sparger in water for three diﬀerent gas ﬂow rates are presented. Our
ﬁrst observations are the two characteristic peaks being well deﬁned at ﬂow rates of 50l
h
and100l
h. These are the regions where bubble interactions are frequent indicating the
importance of turbulent interactions on dispersion. Regarding the highest ﬂow rate no
double peak can be observed any more. In this case, bubble interactions are as frequent
in the column center as in the "peak regions" of the void fraction proﬁles at lower gas ﬂow
rates. Plus, larger bubbles appear due to coalescence changing the nature of interactions.
However, a general evolution with increasing gas ﬂow rate can be identiﬁed. By increasing
the gas injection by a factor of 2, the gas hold-up is approximately doubled as well.
In ﬁgure III.14 the same kind of data is plotted in the case of the slugﬂow sparger.
In comparison to ﬁgure III.13, the mean bubble dispersion induced by the slugﬂow
sparger is smaller. This diﬀerence is becoming less obvious with increasing gas ﬂow rate
indicating again an important role of turbulent dispersion. Indeed, at low ﬂow rate
99Chapter III. Experimental Results
Figure III.13: Void Fraction Proﬁles in the case of Membrane Injection in Water at
diﬀerent Flow Rates
bubble interaction frequencies between both spargers are very diﬀerent inducing diﬀerent
plume widths. Ellipsoidal bubbles interact a lot while spherical caps rise rather isolatedly.
This means that in the case of spherical cap bubbles, bubble dispersion is driven by the
unstable trajectory behaviour and especially by recirculating liquid or mesoscale eddies.
At the highest ﬂow rate bubble interaction is frequent for both sparger and becomes the
driving phenomenon in bubble dispersion generating similar void fraction proﬁles.

Flow Rates

III.3.2 Liquid Properties
The same void fraction proﬁles are also plotted for the other ﬂuids at the lowest gas
injection ﬂow rate of 50l
hand both sparger types. In ﬁgure III.15 results from all ﬂuids
in the case of the membrane sparger are illustrated. A clear eﬀect of the surface tension
can be seen. It was already pointed out that surface tension is mainly inﬂuencing bubble
interactions without coalescence or break-ups. These interactions are frequent in case
of Breox ( 0:5%) and impact strongly turbulent bubble dispersion. Hence, a larger void
fraction proﬁle compared to water can be seen. Plus, due to the decreased bubble sizes,
more bubbles are captured in liquid recirculation resulting in a higher averaged gas
hold-up.
The viscosity shows a damping eﬀect on bubble dispersion. Bubbles are more and more
located in the center and the double peaks disappears. The plume is becoming more
conﬁned and takes even a jet-like shape at the highest viscosity.

Fluids
Figure III.16 shows bubble dispersion in diﬀerent ﬂuids in the case of the slugﬂow
sparger. An unexpected result is the higher gas hold-up in Water compared to Breox
(0:5%). This could derive from our image treatment or more precisely from the diﬀerent
101Chapter III. Experimental Results
ways of volume calculation of WIBs and COSIs. Indeed, in ﬂuids with decreased surface
tension, bubbles are less stable and show lower solidity. Consequently, in Breox ( 0:5%)
more COSIs are identiﬁed than in Water. Since COSIs volume is calculated diﬀerently,
the mean gas hold-up is probably underestimated. Normally, it was presumed that
surface tension modifcation will not inﬂunce much spherical cap rising, which is why one
rather expects a similar void fraction proﬁle than in water.
Anyway, a comparable behavior between the two spargers is observed with increasing
viscosity. Here as well, bubble dispersion decreases until taking a jet-like proﬁle at the
highest viscosity.
Figure III.16: Void Fraction Proﬁles in case of Slugﬂow Sparger with 50l
hin Diﬀerent
Fluids
In conclusion, liquid properties inﬂuence greatly the dispersion of bubble plumes.
Surface tension plays only a role in the case of the membrane sparger by modifying
bubble size and interactions. In contrast, viscosity impacts bubble dispersion strongly
sparger independently. It shows a damping eﬀect on rising instability, liquid recirculation
and bubble-wake interaction.
102III.4. Liquid Velocity
III.4 Liquid Velocity
To further investigate hydrodynamics, the liquid velocity induced by bubble plumes and
its sensitivity to experimental conditions are studied. At this point, a citation from the
book (Chatﬁeld, C., 1984) seems appropriate:
Anyone who tries to analyse a time series, without plotting it ﬁrst, is asking for trouble.
III.4.1 Water
This comment is very important in non stationnary ﬂows, especially when averaged
values may lead to misunderstandings. Hence, the liquid velocity in time for both sparger
types at the ﬂow rate of 50l

and b) Slugﬂow Sparger
103Chapter III. Experimental Results
The periodic behaviour of both signals is very similar. Like already presented in
section III.1, time scales characterizing bubble plume oscillations for both spargers at the
same gas ﬂow rate are close to each other. Anyway, attention should rather be given to
the signal itself and to corresponding scales. It is worth to mention that even in vertical
direction velocity ﬂuctuations are centered around a value, which is close to zero. This
gives a ﬁrst idea that ﬂuctuations may be more important than the mean ﬂow in bubble
plume motion.
III.4.1.1 Vertical Direction
Mean Values
However, averaged values must be investigated anyway. Once again, sparger and
injection ﬂow rates are studied in water, ﬁrst. In ﬁgure III.18 averaged liquid velocities
in case of the membrane sparger for three diﬀerent ﬂow rates are presented. The ﬁrst
observation are the relatively weak values compared to the raw signal conﬁrming that
ﬂuctuations are at least as important as the mean ﬂow. Secondly, all curves pass through
the point (0.5,0) validating in a certain manner our two dimensional measurements.
Two zones can be distinguished. On the left hand side of the point located at x= 0:5
an upstream ﬂow can be recognized while on the right hand side a downstream ﬂow is
present. By integrating the velocity along the whole horizontal axis one obtains a result
close to zero. This means that mass balance is met in the considered two dimensional
interrogation ﬁeld. Hence, our assumption that the considered hydrodynamic structure
is two dimensional is checked and validated.
The sensitivity to the injection ﬂow rate is clear. Maximum and minimum values
increases and decreases with increasing gas ﬂow rate, respectively. For a given time, at
higher ﬂow rates more ﬂuid quantity is pushed upwards and then downwards. Between
the highest and the lowest ﬂow rate a velocity diﬀerence of factor 2is found. One must
also mention that measurements are only performed until a certain distance of some mil-
limeterstothewall. Therefore, thecurvesdonotreachavelocityofzerointhewallregion.
104III.4. Liquid Velocity
Figure III.18: Vertical Mean Liquid Velocity in the case of Membrane Sparger in Water
In ﬁgure III.19 the same information is plotted in the case of the slugﬂow sparger.
Again with increasing gas ﬂow rate, liquid velocity increases in the column center and
decreases at column edges. In comparison to ﬁgure III.18 all maximum values are closer
to each other, which can be explained by similar bubble rising velocities due to similar
size distributions. Regarding the ﬂow rate of 50l
h, mass conservation is not met indicating
the presence of three dimensional eﬀects. Last may be provoked by the unstable rising
behavior of rather isolated spherical caps.
Figure III.19: Vertical Mean Liquid Velocity in the case of Slugﬂow Sparger in Water
105Chapter III. Experimental Results
Fluctuations
It is clear that studying averaged values in order to analyze a non stationnary
phenomenon is not enough. To go deeper in the analysis, velocity standard deviations
(RMS) are plotted for both spargers in water and with a ﬂow rate of 50l
h(see ﬁgure
III.20 (top)). Both curves show higher ﬂuctuations close to the center where more
bubbles are present and lower values close to the edges. Velocities in the very center
should be considered carefully. Because of the truncation, erroneous values appear.
The most interesting part of ﬁgure III.20 (top) are the scales, which are high compared
to averaged velocities. Strong upstream as well as downstream ﬂows and large eddies
induce strong ﬂuctuations. It should also be noted that a maximum is located close to
x= 0:25in ﬁgure III.20 (top left) corresponding to the position of the peaks in the void
fraction proﬁles in ﬁgure III.13 indicating a strong relation between both. This result
is conﬁrmed by ﬁgure III.20 (top right) and ﬁgure III.14 where these peaks are absent.
To better understand these values, two points on the horizontal axis were chosen to plot
mean velocity histograms for both spargers (ﬁgure III.20 (middle and bottom)).
The ﬁrst point located at the "peak position" x= 0:25is chosen to compare the impact
of the bubble type in the column center. Histograms of the vertical velocity can be seen
in ﬁgure III.20 (middle). Regarding the membrane sparger (left) a bi-modal distribution
with almost sinusoidal shape can be recognized. By also taking into account the scales,
it is rather easy to understand that these ﬂuctuations are well organized and must
correspond to bubble plume motion. In the case of the slugﬂow sparger, the histogram at
x= 0:25is not that clear. An overlay of a sinusoidal and a Gaussian distribution can be
observed. Again, the bi-modal one results from the low frequency bubble plume motion.
The Gaussian distribution is induced by the unstable trajectory behavior (Ryskin &
Leal, 1984b) of spherical cap bubbles provoking chaotic ﬂow structures. The second
point close to the edge at x= 0:9was chosen to further analyze bubble type inﬂuences
(see ﬁgure III.20 (bottom)) in wall region. This time both histograms show clearly a
combination of sinusoidal and Gaussian distribution. The sinusidal one results from
the organized bubble plume motion, which is still present in the considered zone. The
Gaussian distribution indicates chaotic or random motion. Considering the small velocity
values of these ﬂuctuations one can conclude that they must correspond to wall eﬀects
or wall induced turbulence.

It was shown that both bubble types induce organized motion over the whole column
cross section. This organized motion is easier to quantify in the wall region than in
column midle where bubble induced agitation is also present. Besides, spherical cap
bubbles provoke way more randon motion than ellipsoidal bubbles due to their unstable
rising behavior.
107Chapter III. Experimental Results
POD
POD is applied to velocity ﬁelds to understand the contribution of every ﬂow structure
to the global regime in terms of energy. For a better understanding only velocity proﬁles
including ﬂuctuations are analyzed. But ﬁrst, the spectrum from the eigenvalue solution
of equation II.28 is presented in ﬁgure III.21 (left).
Figure III.21: POD Energy Spectrum (left) and Mode Dependency between Mode 1 and
2 (right)
All energy distributions are plotted as a function of their mode number. The two
ﬁrst modes show a way higher energy contribution than all the others. In our case
the highest energy is induced by large ﬂuctuations corresponding to organized bubble
plume motion. Plus, the similar energy level of the ﬁrst two modes can indicate that
both are related to eachother. This is the reason why dependency between the ﬁrst
modes ( 1 4) is checked. It turned out that the ﬁrst and the second mode are strongly
related as illustrated in ﬁgure III.21 (right) where the corresponding phase portrait is
plotted. The almost circle like shape of the curve indicates that both modes belong to
the same hydrodynamic structure. The third mode is rather separated from all other
modes in terms of energy. It is assumed that this one could be a transition mode between
organized and ramdon motion. But if one had to decide where this mode belongs to,
the response would rather be organized motion. Furthermore, the modes 4 10follow a
line with a slope of  5
3that is presented by a dotted blue line in the ﬁgure. The origin
of this value will be discussed at the end of the chapter. Finally, the modes 11 100
follows a line with a slope of  11
9, which is drawn by the red dashed line. (Sirovich,
1987) related this value to inertial turbulence. With respect to the results mentioned
108III.4. Liquid Velocity
above, the vertical velocity in a single point at x= 0:25is reconstructed for diﬀer-
ent mode combinations. In the present case, even time resolved reconstruction is possible:
wn
t=X
nan
tn
z (III.6)
Three deﬁned mode combinations ( n2[1;2],n= [3]andn2[4;7]) are chosen to
estimate the contribution of bubble plume motion and bubble induced liquid ﬂuctuations.
In ﬁgure III.22 the reconstructed velocities in time and the corresponding ﬂuctuation
histograms can be seen. The ﬁrst two modes show a strong coupling and represent
clearly the oscillating bubble plume motion, which could be separated from the rest of
the ﬂow structure. The signal is sinusoidal and the frequency coincides perfectly with low
frequency time scales from section III.1. The third mode (III.21 (middle)) representing
an intermediate energy, shows indeed a transition between organized and chaotic ﬂow.
Quasi periodic ﬂuctuations can still be recognized, but noise corresponding to random
motion becomes important as well. This interpretation becomes even more obvious
by looking at the attached histogram. As in the ﬂuctuation analysis a combination
of a sinusoidal and a Gaussian distribution can be identiﬁed. But in ﬁgure III.20 the
Gaussian one is slightly more dominant than here suggesting again that the third mode
belongs rather to organized motion. Finally, the same reconstruction is done for modes
4 7. The signal is completly disorganized, which is conﬁrmed by the histogram. The
distribution shows Gaussian shape indicating chaotic ﬂow. By taking into account the
small energy values, one can assume that these ﬂuctuations correspond completly to
bubble induced ﬂuctuations.
In ﬁgure III.23 the RMS as a function of the horizontal position are reconstructed, on
the left handside for low mode numbers and at the right handside for higher ones. The
RMS proﬁle for the ﬁrst two modes resulting from the bubble plume motion indicates
their domination on the ﬂow structure in the wall region where bubble passages are rare.
With increasing modes the RMS increases in the center. This illustrates the contribution
of bubble induced liquid ﬂuctuations. On the right ﬁgure higher modes are plotted. Over
a mode number of 10ﬂuctuations are rather related to turbulence, which was already
suggested by the slope of the energy spectrum.

In ﬁgure III.24 contributions from disorganized motion (bubble induced ﬂuctuations
and turbulence) and organized plume induced ﬂuctuations are compared to the total
RMS. As it could be expected, organzied motion is present over the whole column cross
section, but becomes more important towards the walls. Disorganized motion (bubble
induced agitation and turbulence) is increasing towards the column center.

Sparger
The same POD analysis is done for the case of the slugﬂow sparger. In ﬁgure III.25,
the energy spectrum and the dependency of the ﬁrst modes are plotted for spherical
caps. As previously, the same energy ditribution and the same mode dependency than
for the membrane sparger is found. Modes 1and2correspond to organized motion,
mode 3to transition and higher modes to chaotic or random motion. The two diﬀerent
mentioned slopes are observed here as well. Hence, one is able to distinguish bubble
induced ﬂuctuations and turbulence. This result could be expected since comparable low
frequency oscillations were determined in section III.1. Therefore, one comes directly to
the reconstructed velocity signals from the point x= 0:25. Because of the similar results
of eigenvalues, the exact same mode separation than for the membrane sparger ia shown
in ﬁgure III.26.

112III.4. Liquid Velocity
Again, the ﬁrst two modes belong to the oscillating bubble plume motion. The
chaotic bubble induced motion of the spherical caps could be ﬁltered. Hence, a clear
sinusoidal ditribution can be seen for the reconstructed signal of these ﬁrst two modes.
In the middle of ﬁgure III.26 the third mode is used separately for reconstruction since it
is believed to be a transition mode as for the membrane sparger. Indeed, the histograms
are similar, but a small diﬀerence between both spargers can be recognized anyway. The
sinusoidal distribution, seen in the case of the membrane sparger, is not as clear anymore
indicating that the third mode is less organized in the case of spherical caps. The bubble
plume motion is less structured because of the unstable trajectory behaviour and more
bubble induced ﬂuctuations are measured. Lastly, modes 4 7show a chaotic behaviour
creating a well shaped Gaussian distribution. These ﬂuctuations are believed to derive
from bubble induced agitation.
Figure III.27: Reconstructed RMS from POD Treatment for Slugﬂow Sparger
In ﬁgure III.27 the RMS are reconstructed for diﬀerent mode combinations. First
two modes corresponding to organized motion related to the bubble plume movement
show the highest contribution in the region next to the walls. With increasing mode
numbers, the contribution of bubble induced ﬂuctuations increases as well in the column
center. On the right ﬁgure RMS is plotted for higher modes. The contribution of bubble
induced ﬂuctuations can be recognized by the gap between the dotted and the dash dot-
ted line. Turbulence on the other hand is rather distributed over the whole column width.

In ﬁgure III.28 contributions of organized and random motion to the total RMS are
shown. Similar to the membrane sparger, organized motion contributes more at the edges
and random structures in the column center. In conclusion, the studied ﬂow structure
is mainly constituted by organized ﬂuctuations in the case of both spargers. The RMS
of ﬂuctuations are of similar amplitude compared to averaged velocity values. Therefore,
it make sense to apply the POD in order to understand the contribution of organized

III.4.1.2 Horizontal Direction
Here as well velocity signals are plotted before any analysis for the same reasons than
in vertical direction. In ﬁgure III.29 the horizontal velocity component in a single point
is shown in time. Both signals from the diﬀerent spargers show the same oscillating
behaviour. Even the amplitudes are very close.
Mean Values
Let us begin by analyzing averaged velocity proﬁles that are plotted in ﬁgure III.30
for the membrane (left) and the slugﬂow sparger (right).

(left) and Slugﬂow Sparger (right)
115Chapter III. Experimental Results
Both sparger types produce very similar horizontal velocity distributions. In the
column center the averaged transverse velocity is very small. It is worth to mention that
with increasing gas ﬂow rate liquid velocities become even negative, but only slightly.
The highest velocities in horizontal direction are detected close to the walls and increases
with increasing gas ﬂow rate. It is a little diﬃcult to interpret such mean values in non
stationnary ﬂows. But one can estimate that more liquid moves towards the wall than
towards the center. The explanation can be given in form of residence time. First the
vortical cells passes through the acquisition window. Since the velocity of these vortices
is constant they should not have great impact on averaged values. The second situation
is when bubbles are pushed towards the walls through the interrogation window. Then
liquid is pushed against the walls generating higher horizontal mean velocities close to
the walls.
Fluctuations
Anyway, to investigate horizontal velocity in detail, ﬂuctuations must be considered.
As in the case of the vertical direction, horizontal ﬂuctuations in form of RMS are plotted
in ﬁgure III.31 (top) for both spargers. The highest horizontal velocity ﬂuctuations are
registered in the column center while the lowest ones are close to walls. The wall damps
the horizontal movement creating lower values. The same evolution can be observed for
both spargers. Even the scales are very similar.
To go further in our analysis, velocity ﬂuctuations are plotted in the same positions than
for the vertical velocity ( x= 0:25andx= 0:9). In horizontal direction both spargers
show the exact same behaviour. In the column middle a rather sinusoidal distribution
can be observed. These bi-modal ﬂuctuations belong to the bubble plume oscillating
motion. It seems that both bubble types induce equally organized motion in horizontal
direction in the center. Close to the walls at x= 0:9horizontal ﬂuctuations are more
chaotic, which can be recognized by the Gaussian distribution of the RMS. Indeed,
bubble induced ﬂuctuations are higher in horizontal direction. Hence, they contribute
more to liquid ﬂuctuations than the organized motion in the considered zone.

117Chapter III. Experimental Results
III.4.2 Liquid Properties
The inﬂuences of ﬂuid properties on liquid hydrodynamics induced by bubbles is studied
as well. Therefore, vertical velocities in diﬀerent ﬂuids and for both spargers are plotted.
III.4.2.1 Vertical Direction
Mean Values
In ﬁgure III.32 and ﬁgure III.33 averaged vertical velocities at a gas ﬂow rate of 50l
h
are plotted for the membrane and the slugﬂow sparger, respectively. First the membrane
sparger is studied. In ﬁgure III.32 the same curve shapes with ascending and descending
part than in water are recognized. A ﬁrst comparison is done between water and Breox
(0:5%) to investigate surface tension modiﬁcations.
A surprising observation is the velocity increase in Breox ( 0:5%) having a lower surface
tension than water. This diﬀerence is larger in the upstream than in the donwstream part
indicating slightly stronger three dimensional eﬀects. Indeed, it was already mentioned
that surface tension shows high inﬂuence when bubble interaction is frequent, but
without coalescence.
To further investigate liquid propertries, all Breox ﬂuids are compared between eachother
to study viscosity impact. The same decreasing behaviour from the center to the edges
until reaching negative values close to the wall is observed. Hence, a mean recirculation
zone can be identiﬁed. Maximum values in the center increases signiﬁcantly with increas-
ing viscosity. At this point one can make the connection with airlift conﬁgurations. It
is possible to consider the upstream and the downstream part as two diﬀerent columns.
The middle part would be the riser and the external parts the downcomers. In such
airlift conﬁguration, liquid velocities are driven by the weight diﬀerence between these
two parts. This argument can be used here as well. With increasing gas ﬂow rate,
the gas hold-up and therefore the mixture density diﬀerence becomes larger and liquid
velocity is increased. Furthermore, the ascending zone is becoming smaller while the
descending zone is becoming more important. This can be related to the dispersion,
which is decreasing as well with increasing viscosity. Also, it seems that wall eﬀects are
becoming important damping the descending liquid motion. This is particularly evident
in the case of Breox ( 24%) where the velocity close to the wall approaches zero.
118III.4. Liquid Velocity
Figure III.32: Vertical Mean Liquid Velocity in the case of Membrane Sparger in diﬀerent
Fluids
The same analysis is performed in the case of the slugﬂow sparger (see ﬁgure III.33).
As expected, surface tension shows only a minor eﬀect on liquid hydrodynamics. This is
because surface tension is mainly inﬂuencing bubble interactions, which are not frequent
here. With increasing viscosity the same tendencies than in ﬁgure III.32 are observed.
Maximum values in the center increase and the ascending zone becomes smaller. Once
again, the connection with the airlift conﬁguration can give an explanation for this
observation. Plus, the same non linear relation between velocities close to the wall
and viscosity can be seen. Again, wall eﬀects become more important with increasing
viscosity. Figure III.33 shows that spherical caps generate lower velocity than ellipsoidal
bubbles in ﬂuids with higher viscosity than water. This indicates a diﬀerence of the
momentum transfers from the gas to the liquid phase between both bubble types.
In conclusion, both spargers show a quite similar evolution concerning liquid velocity
with increasing viscosity. The main diﬀerences are the maximums and minimums being
higher in the case of the membrane sparger for all ﬂuids. At the same ﬂow rate, ellipsoidal
bubbles seem to better transfer their momentum to the liquid phase than spherical cap
bubbles. This can be explained by a larger interfacial area of smaller objects for a given
volume (here injection ﬂow rate).
119Chapter III. Experimental Results
Figure III.33: Vertical Mean Liquid Velocity in the case of Slugﬂow Sparger in diﬀerent
Fluids
Fluctuations
The case of Breox ( 13:6%) with a gas ﬂow rate of 50l
hthrough both spargers was
chosen to analyze ﬂuctuations in viscous media in the same way than in water. Similarly
to water, ﬂuctuations are at least of the same order of magnitude than the mean ﬂow.
This illustrates that they must be considered again. In ﬁgure III.34 ﬂuctuations for
both spargers and the corresponding histograms in two diﬀerent points are plotted.
The general evolution from the column center to the edges is similar in both cases.
Fluctuations are maximum in the center and minimum values are registered close to
the wall. The main diﬀerence concerns the scales. Indeed, spherical cap bubbles induce
higher velocity ﬂuctuations. To get more inside, histograms are considered as well.
In the case of the membrane sparger (left) both histograms are very comparable. At
both column positions, a combination of a sinusoidal and a Gaussian distribution can
be observed. Following the same argumentation than previously, the ﬂuctuations are
strongly inﬂuenced by the organized motion and by bubble induced ﬂuctuations. It
seems that compared to water, the ﬂow is more chaotic since the Gaussian distribution
predominates. This observation suggests that organized motion is more damped by
viscous eﬀects than bubble agitation indicating that the energy contribution of the
120III.4. Liquid Velocity
diﬀerent ﬂow structures is not the same than in water. In the case of the slugﬂow sparger,
only fully Gaussian distributions are found. It seems that no organized motion is present
anymore in that case. The chaotic bubble induced motion from spherical caps dominates
compared to swarm eﬀects like bubble plume wandering conﬁrming that last one is more
damped by the viscosity.
POD
The study of the considered ﬂuctuations showed that the case of the membrane
sparger is better adapted for further analyzes since plume motion can still be recognized.
In the slugﬂow sparger case, no traces of organized motion were found as illustrated
above. For an easy understanding the same ﬁgures than for the POD in water are
plotted. In ﬁgure III.35 the energy spectrum and the phase portrait are shown. The
energy spectrum is slightly diﬀerent than in water. The ﬁrst mode contains more energy
(60%) than all the other ones and is not related as it was the case in water. In Breox
the second and the third modes are very close to each other in terms of energy (each
mode10%). Hence, one supposed a mode dependancy between these two ones. But
the relation between these modes is not as clear as in water (see ﬁgure III.35 (right)).
Nevertheless, for further treatments one supposed that both, the second and the third,
are transition modes. Besides, the same two slopes corresponding to bubble induced
liquid ﬂuctuations and turbulence are observed.
In ﬁgure III.36 reconstructed velocity signals in time in one point and the corresponding
histograms are plotted. In contrast to the case of water, the ﬁrst mode is plotted as single
one, then modes two and three together and ﬁnally modes 4 7again. By considering
the signal of the ﬁrst mode it is pretty clear that bubble plume motion is represented.
This is also conﬁrmed by the sinusoidal shaped histogram. The reconstructed signal
from the second and third mode are plotted in the middle. As in the case of water
the transition signal shows disorganized oscillating behaviour. Indeed, the histogram
is mainly Gaussian, but shows also a slightly bi-modal distribution. Hence, organized
and chaotic motion is present. Finally, the last signal of ﬁgure III.36 represents only
disorganized or random motion. No oscillation period is found and the histogram shows
Gaussian shape.

In ﬁgure III.37 reconstructed RMS are plotted. For lower modes (left) clear tendencies
can be seen. The ﬁrst mode related to plume oscillation is more or less constant along the
horizontal axis. With increasing number of modes taken into account, RMS is increasing
in the column center. This evolution can again be related to bubble induced chaotic
motion. On the right handside of ﬁgure III.37 the same information for higher modes
is plotted. The small gaps between the curves indicate less important contribution of
chaotic motion, which is certainly damped by viscous eﬀects.

Sparger in Breox ( 13:6%)
Finally, ﬁgure III.38 compares all contributions to the total RMS. Bubble plume mo-
tion induced ﬂuctuations are rather homogeneous along the horizontal axis. Chaotic
motion contributes clearly more in the center and becomes less important by approaching
the walls.

To further investigate viscous eﬀects the energy spectrum in the case of membrane
injection in Breox ( 18:5%) is show in ﬁgure III.39. In such viscous media no oscillation
frequency or other organized motion can be identiﬁed any more. Also the slope of  11

indicating classical turbulence is not observed. The slope  5
3(blue dashed line) suggests
that only random bubble induced liquid ﬂuctuations are present.

In turbulent ﬂow, the eigenvalue spectrum exhibits a  11
9slope in log–log plot of
eigenvalueas a function of eigenvalue number N. This result was explained by (Knight
& Sirovich, 1990) arguing that it is a characteristic of the inertial range of turbulence. As
exposed by these authors, in turbulent ﬂows, the turbulent kinetic energy (tke) can be
related to the energy density spectrum of velocity EV(K), per vector wave number K, as
follows:
tke=1
VZ Z Z
u02dv=Z Z Z
EV(K)dK (III.7)
Clearly, the dimension of the energy density spectrum of velocity EV(K)isL5

the inertial range of turbulence, one can express the energy density spectrum of velocity
EV(K)per vector wave number in terms of the energy density spectrum of velocity ES()
per scalar wave number :EV(K) =ES()
(42). The trend of the energy density spectrum

the energy density spectrum of velocity EV(K), carrying the same physical dimensions. In
addition, (Knight&Sirovich, 1990)stipulatedthatthewavenumbermayberelatedtothe
eigenvalue number as =N1
3. Hence, they obtained the 11

9, which
is observed in our data processing for large values of N. Surprisingly, for intermediate
values of eigenvalue number N(between 5and10 15), the slope of the log–log plot
of eigenvalue as a function of the eigenvalue number Nis diﬀerent. This may be due
to bubble-induced turbulence. Indeed, (Risso, 2018) explained the  3trend observed in
the energy density spectrum of velocity ES()per scalar wave number in bubbly ﬂow for
intermediate wave numbers. Following the previous analysis, given density spectrum of
velocityES()/( 3), the energy density spectrum of velocity EV(K)per vector wave
number becomes EV(K)/ 5and thus,EV(K)/N 5
3. This trend is observed in our
data processing for intermediate values of Nwhen the ﬂow is fully-turbulent (cases water
and Breox ( 13:6%)) and it is observed for the whole range of eigenvalues in the case Breox
(18:5%). The diﬀerence between fully-developed turbulent ﬂow, transitional and laminar
ones is tricky. One can refer to a recent paper of (Abdelsamie & Thévenin, 2017) on
“spectral entropy as a ﬂow state indicator”. Following these authors, one can estimate the
relative energy P(N)related to the Nth eigenvalue as:
PN=NPMax
M=1M(III.8)
whereMaxis the mode number. The authors deﬁne the spectral entropy Sas:
S= MaxX
M=1PMlog(PM) (III.9)
Then, the authors propose to use the spectral entropy as a ﬂow state indicator:
- ifS >1:25: fully-turbulent ﬂow
- ifSclose to unity: transitional ﬂow
- ifS <1: laminar ﬂow
126III.4. Liquid Velocity
In our case, the values of spectral entropy can be deduced from eigenvalue data. The
results are listed in table III.5. Following this approach, the last case is laminar.

TABLEAU III.5: Entropy Values for Diﬀerent Experimental Conditions
In conclusion, one is able to separate diﬀerent ﬂow structures like organized motion,
bubble induced ﬂuctuations and turbulence in terms of energy. The ratio of the energy
contribution is changing with increasing viscosity. Organized motion as well as turbulence
are damped by viscous eﬀects. Furthermore, in all studied liquids, the membrane sparger
produces more coherent ﬂow structures than spherical caps, which can be explained by
the unstable behaviour of these bubbles.
III.4.2.2 Horizontal Direction
Mean Values
The inﬂuence of liquid properties on the horizontal velocity component is also investi-
gated, but only averaged values are studied. In ﬁgure III.40 the mean horizontal velocity
in diﬀerent ﬂuids is plotted for the membrane (left) and the slugﬂow sparger (right).
The averaged horizontal velocity is not very sensitive to sparger types since similar
behaviour can be seen for all ﬂuids. Once again, surface tension has only a minor eﬀect
on the velocity. Values close to zero are found in the column center and maximums
close to the walls. With increasing viscosity the horizontal averaged movement is clearly
damped, which is in agreement with results from section III.3 concerning dispersion.
Breox ( 13:6%) is the only case where a diﬀerence between both sparger can be seen. In
the case of the membrane sparger no transverse movement between the column center
and the point x= 0:5can be identiﬁed. The only horizontal positive velocity is registered
close to the walls with a maximum at x0:9. This maximum value is three times lower
than in water. On the other hand, in the case of the slugﬂow sparger a more or less
127Chapter III. Experimental Results
Figure III.40: Horizontal Liquid Velocity in Time in Water for a) Membrane Sparger and
b) Slugﬂow Sparger
constant averaged velocity along the horizontal axis is found. Regarding Breox ( 18:5%),
almost no horizontal mean movement is observed. Only a weak averaged velocity towards
the column center is determined, which is slightly higher for the membrane sparger.
At even higher viscosity (Breox ( 24%)) both spargers induce comparable proﬁles again
being in agreement with their similar ﬂow structure. The hydrodynamics are jet-like and
mostly large bubbles are generated. In the region between x= 0:5andx= 1no mean
velocity is seen. But in the center region a clear horizontal mean velocity towards the
walls is indicated. At this moment one has to point out that ﬂuctuations in horizontal
direction are not studied. One assumes that similar behaviour than in vertical direction
would be found as it is the case in water. Instead, the results of this short paragraph
will be used in the next section in combination with horizontal BIV results to investigate
bubble dispersion.
III.5 Bubble Swarm Velocity
It was already mentioned in section III.1 that the bubble rise velocity seems to play
an important role in bubble plume oscillations. Indeed, the unstable behaviour of the
oscillating plume is generated by the vertical density gradient, which is directly related
to the local gas fraction and hence to the bubble rise velocity. Therefore, an algoritm
was developped to determine the velocity in vertical and horizontal direction (see section
II.1.3.4). Since the resulting swarm velocity seems to be more important than velocities
128III.5. Bubble Swarm Velocity
of isolated or well characterized bubbles, all objects are taken into account for mean
velocity calculations here. The ﬁrst part of this section is dedicated to the inﬂuence of
injection conditions on bubble velocities. Both spargers and three diﬀerent injection ﬂow
rates are considered. In the second part, ﬂuid properties are investigated via the already
presented ﬂuids from section II.1.2.
III.5.1 Water
The vertical bubble swarm rising velocity is studied in the case of membrane and slugﬂow
injection in water as presented in ﬁgure III.45 and III.46, respectively.
Figure III.41: Vertical Mean Bubble Velocity in the case of Membrane Sparger in Water
Regarding membrane injection (III.41), it is interesting to note that maximum
velocities are located at the same horizontal position with a value close to 0:4for gas
ﬂow rates of 50l
hand100l
h. In the case of the highest ﬂow rate the maximum velocity
is slightly closer to the center. This result is in agreement with the corresponding void
fraction proﬁles showing double peaks only for the lowest and the medium ﬂow rate.
By approaching the wall a decreasing evolution can be seen for all curves. This can be
explained by bubbles trapped in liquid recirculation. Indeed, with increasing ﬂow rate,
liquid recirculation become stronger (see section III.4). More bubbles get entrained and
are taken into account in mean value calculations decreasing the resulting velocity. To
129Chapter III. Experimental Results
complete our analysis, velocity values in the center should be compared as well. In the
case of the lowest gas ﬂow rate a value of 0:28m
sis obtained. At higher ﬂow rates the
same velocity of0:32m
sis found indicating an ensemble eﬀect inside the bubble swarm.
In line with the discussion of section I.1.3.2, the drag coeﬃcient seems to be decreased
by swarm eﬀects like coalescence generating higher velocities. This eﬀect is limited in the
considered void fraction range, which is the reason why at the highest ﬂow rate the same
value in the column center is found.
Figure III.42: Vertical Mean Bubble Velocity in the case of Slugﬂow Sparger in Water
In ﬁgure III.42 the same kind of data is presented for slugﬂow injection. In contrast
to the membrane sparger, the slugﬂow sparger generates very similar curve shapes at all
considered ﬂow rates. All three curves show the same evolution from the center to the
column edges than the membrane sparger at the highest ﬂow rate of 200l
h. This result
is consistent with bubble size distributions. The membrane sparger shows large objects
due to coalescence with size ranges close to spherical cap ones. Since in water, no stable
bubble shape is possible for such large objects, a limit of DE= 28mmis found. The
corresponding saturation swarm velocity seems to be 0:32m
s. This means that spherical
cap induced hydrodynamics are similar to each other, which is in agreement with the
constant low frequency oscillation for all ﬂow rates (similar density gradient).
Let us now consider the horizontal swarm velocity that can give further information about
bubble dispersion. In ﬁgure III.43 horizontal mean velocities are show for membrane
130III.5. Bubble Swarm Velocity
sparger injection. It is not surprising to observe almost exclusively positive mean
values indicating bubble movement towards the wall, which can also be understood as
dispersion. Only at the lowest ﬂow rate negative values are registered close to the wall.
This movement in column center direction results from bubble trapped in vortex cells
created by recirculation.
FigureIII.43: HorizontalMeanBubbleVelocityinthecaseofMembraneSpargerinWater
A similar observation is found for the slugﬂow injection in ﬁgure III.44. In this case all
horizontal mean swarm velocities show positive values, even at the lowest ﬂow rate. The
diﬀerence to the membrane sparger can be found in the bubble size distribution. There
are not enough small bubbles trapped in the vortex cells to create negative mean values.
Finally, these results are perfectly consistent with visual observations and the natural
bubble dispersion.
III.5.2 Liquid Properties
In this section, inﬂuences of liquid properties on bubble swarm velocities are investigated.
Therefore, only the lowest gas ﬂow rate of 50l
his chosen again to illustrate vertical swarm
rise velocities for all ﬂuids (III.45). For the analyse results are compared to the reference
liquid in literature, water. The mean bubble size in water for the considered case is
around 5mm. The measured rise velocity near the center where bubbles are exclusively
rising is around 0:28m
s, which is in agreement with literature.
131Chapter III. Experimental Results
Figure III.44: Horizontal Mean Bubble Velocity in the case of Slugﬂow Sparger in Water
As ﬁrst liquid property, surface tension is studied. A comparison is done between water
and Breox ( 0:5%). Both curves show the same evolution along the horizontal column
section, except that in the case of Breox ( 0:5%) the velocity is signiﬁcantly decreased.
Visual oberservations revealed two main reasons, the generation of microbubbles and a
general decrease of the mean bubble size distribution. In other words, for approximatly
the same void fraction, way more bubbles are present in the column. Bubble interactions
are frequent and can have inﬂuence on the eﬀective viscosity of the mixture. In general
all kinds of inclusions, including bubbles, increase the viscosity. Plus, the rise velocity of
every single bubble decreases with decreasing bubble size, which is the case here.
Furthermore, the viscosity impact is studied. The Breox ﬂuids with 0:5%,8:7%,13:6%,
18:5%and24%of mass concentration show viscosities of 1mPas,10mPas,20mPas,
50mPasand100mPas, respectively. By comparing all Breox ﬂuids, increasing velocities
in the column center with increasing viscosity can be seen. The slighlty lower value
atx= 0in the case of Breox ( 24%,100mPas) is assumed to result from our image
treatment and more precisely from the image border truncation. However, the velocity
increase can be explained by at least two phenomena. The ﬁrst one is the trajectory
modiﬁcation from zigzag to straight line. In this way the traveled paths become shorter
and the resulting rising velocity higher. Furthermore, the bubble size distribution plays
again an important role. With increasing viscosity, bubble shapes become more stable.
Break-ups do not appear any more, but coalescence does. Hence, the mean size is
132III.5. Bubble Swarm Velocity
increasing, which is the reason why the rise velocity increases as well. Secondly, bubble
induced liquid agitation is damped by the viscosity. The momentum transfer from gas to
liquid is less disturbed and higher velocity values can be generated. This is in agreement
with III.32 showing higher maximum and minimum values with increasing viscosity
revealing strong liquid convection. This convection also provokes higher recirculation
entraining more bubbles, which is the reason why negative mean bubble velocities are
found close to the edges for all Breox ﬂuids except Breox ( 0:5%). All these ﬂuids with
higher viscosities than water converge to more or less the same value close to the egdes.
Figure III.45: Vertical Mean Bubble Velocity in the case of Membrane Sparger in diﬀerent
Fluids at 50l
h
The eﬀect of liquid properties is also studied in the case of spherical cap injection
through the slugﬂow sparger (see ﬁgure III.46). Again, eﬀects of surface tension are
discussed by comparing water and Breox ( 0:5%). It is not surprising that both curves
are practically merged conﬁrming that surface tension has almost no inﬂuence on the
rising of spherical cap bubbles. The only diﬀerence is the slightly decreased velocity in
the column center, which can be explained by the appearance of microbubbles increasing
the eﬀective viscosity. This conﬁrms equation I.1.3.1 predicting a more or less constant
terminal bubble velocity in the considered size range. Plus, the void fraction is rather
small meaning that correlations for single bubbles are still valid in water, especially in
the case of spherical caps.
133Chapter III. Experimental Results
Once again all Breox ﬂuids are used to study viscosity inﬂuences on rise velocities
in the case of spherical cap bubbles. A clear tendancy can easily be observed. With
increasing viscosity, the maximum velocity in the column center and the minimum one
close to the edges increases and decreases, respectively. This velocity evolution combined
with liquid circulation generates less dispersed bubble swarms. At this point one should
remember that low frequency oscillations are insensitive to liquid properties in the case of
spherical cap bubbles. Maximum velocities are changing signiﬁcantly while low frequency
oscillations are not modiﬁed illustrating that it is more complicated to determine the
driving parameters. It seems that the whole velocity proﬁle and not only maximum
values determine swarm oscillations, which is in agreement with the assumption of an
instability wave du to a vertical density gradient.
Figure III.46: Vertical Mean Bubble Velocity in the case of Slugﬂow Sparger in diﬀerent
Fluids at 50l
h
Anyway, horizontal velocities are also plotted in ﬁgure III.47 and III.48 in the same
way as in the case of water. Again, all curves show mainly positive values indicating
bubble dispersion towards the walls. Plus, for both sparger types surface tension has a
minor eﬀect. It seems that both curves in the case of Breox ( 0:5%) are ﬂattened due to
the high number of small bubbles giving a more homogeneous velocity map.
134III.5. Bubble Swarm Velocity
Figure III.47: Horizontal Mean Bubble Velocity in the case of Membrane Sparger in
diﬀerent Fluids at 50l
h
Furthermore, viscosity inﬂuence is investigated. Again, for both spargers, the horizon-
tal velocity decreases with increasing viscosity, conﬁrming the decreasing bubble disper-
sion. In the case of membrane injection, viscosity shows smaller impact on the horizontal
mean velocity than with the slugﬂow injection. This can be explained by bubble interac-
tions, which are frequent for ellipsoidal bubbles. Hence, turbulent dispersion is damped,
but not completly removed. Besides, the maximum velocity located initially close to the
wall (x= 0:75) in water approaches the column center with increasing viscosity. In the
case of spherical caps, viscosity shows much more inﬂuence on the velocity range. While
at low viscosity, values of 0:04m
sare registered, at high viscosity the mean velocity is close
to zero. Plus, maximums are located close to x= 0:45except for the highest viscosities.

135Chapter III. Experimental Results
III.6 Mean Velocity Diﬀerence
The diﬀerence between the mean bubble swarm and the mean liquid velocity in vertical
direction is calculated by the following equation:
Ur=Ub Ul (III.10)
whereUbandUlcorrespond to time averaged velocity proﬁles from BIV and PIV
measurements, respectively. The resulting proﬁles can be seen in ﬁgure III.49. At the
top of the ﬁgure three diﬀerent ﬂow rates are presented for the membrane sparger and
at the bottom for the slugﬂow sparger. Because of the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the mean velocities of both phases, bubble swarm velocities are clearly dominant. The
substraction of the liquid velocity can be considered as correction in order to approach
the slip velocity in the case of isolated bubbles.
Figure III.49: Averaged Slip Velocity in Water for three diﬀerent injection ﬂow rates in
case of Membrane sparger (top) and slugﬂow sparger (bottom)
136III.6. Mean Velocity Diﬀerence
However, these results must be treated carefully because the whole column depth
is used for BIV while only a two dimensional plane is measured in the case of PIV.
Besides, no ﬁlter in terms of bubble characteristics is applied to BIV results. In ﬁgure
III.49 similar evolutions than in ﬁgure III.41 and III.42 are recognized. In the case of the
membrane sparger maximum velocity values seem to migrate slowly towards the column
center with increasing ﬂow rate. While the highest velocity is registered around x0:65
for50l
h, the maximum velocity for 200l
his found around x0:4. If one integrates the
three curves, a decreasing evolution of the realtive velocity Urwith increasing gas ﬂow
rate is observed. This trend can not be seen in the case of the slugﬂow sparger where the
highest integrated velocity value is obtained for the intermediate gas ﬂow rate of 100l
h.
Also the position of the local velocity maximum does not vary much for diﬀerent ﬂow
rates and stays around x= 0:4. This may help to understand why the low frequency
oscillations remain constant in the case of spherical cap bubbles.
Figure III.50: Averaged Slip Velocity in Breox for three diﬀerent injection ﬂow rates in
case of Membrane sparger (top) and slugﬂow sparger (bottom)
137Chapter III. Experimental Results
In ﬁgure III.50 the same information is plotted for diﬀerent ﬂuids and both spargers.
Again, results must be treated carefully, especially in the case of spherical cap bubbles.
This becomes obvious by regarding the velocities close to the edges. Values of 0:05m
s
are found, which can clearly not correspond to spherical caps. Indeed, all objects,
independently of their size, are taken into account for BIV measurements. Considering
the dispersion, it becomes obvious that these weak velocities are related to small bubbles
that can be easily trapped in liquid recirculations. Nevertheless, these ﬁgures can give
important information about swarm velocities, especially in the center of the column.
In ﬁgure III.50 (top) coherent values around 0:25m
sfor ellipsoidal bubbles are found being
in agreement with literature. Only in the case of Breox ( 0:5%) a clear diﬀerence can
be seen. Again, smaller bubble size and higher eﬀective viscosity are the main reasons.
In the case of the slugﬂow sparger, the last point is a little diﬀerent. As previously
presented, spherical cap dynamics are not very sensitive neither to surface tension,
neither to viscosity. Hence, no large variation are observed. Nevertheless, comparable
maximum velocities are determined for all ﬂuids.
III.7 Mixing Time
Bubble plume injection is generally used for mixing in large tanks. This is the reason
why some mixing times are investigated even if they are not comparable with three
dimensional conﬁgurations. Nevertheless, the mixing ability of our pseudo two dimen-
sional bubble column is studied. Therefore, dye injection is used as described in section
II.1.3.5. It should be mentioned that the mixing time analyzed here corresponds to the
time needed to homogenize the liquid in the considered interrogation windows close to
the right wall. All determined mixing times in water and for both sparger types are
presented in table III.6 and in graphical form in ﬁgure III.52.

TABLEAU III.6: Mixing Times in Water
138III.7. Mixing Time
The ﬁrst observation is the large diﬀerence of mixing times between both spargers
at the lowest ﬂow rate. With the slugﬂow sparger 2:5times more time is needed to
homogenize the column after dye injection. This result can partially be explained by
the diﬀerent bubble dispersions and induced agitation. Indeed, in the case of ellipsoidal
bubbles the dispersion is slightly larger and bubbles interact more leading to a wider
plume. Anyway, with increasing injection ﬂow rate through both spargers mixing times
decreases. In the case of the slugﬂow sparger the main reason is bubble interaction
becoming frequent only at higher gas ﬂow rates. At the highest injection ﬂow rate the
exact same time scale is found for both spargers suggesting that a minimum mixing time
for the given bubble column geometry exists.
Figure III.51: Mixing Times in Water as a function of Injection Flow Rate for both
Spargers
Mixing time scales are also investigated in more viscous ﬂuids. Therefore, the Breox
ﬂuids at 20,50and100times the viscosity of water are chosen. Determined time scales
are listed in table III.7 and plotted in ﬁgure III.52.

TABLEAU III.7: Mixing Times in diﬀerent Fluids for 50l
h
139Chapter III. Experimental Results
To our surprise, at a viscosity of 20mPasthe slugﬂow sparger shows lower mixing
times than the membrane sparger. This observation can be explained, at least partially,
by the vertical averaged liquid velocity shown in ﬁgure III.45 and III.46. At the
considered viscosity the ascending part is larger by 15%. It is diﬃcult to clarify why
in this particular case, more momentum seems to be transfered from the gas to the liquid
phase via the spherical bubbles than for the ellipsoidal ones. One argument could be the
higher maximum swarm velocity, but this is also the case for other ﬂuids.
Figure III.52: Mixing Time as a function of Viscosity for both Spargers
With further increasing viscosity, mixing time is increasing as expected. This time
ellipsoidal bubbles generated by the membrane sparger shows a lower time scale. Again,
a relation between the mixing time and the vertical averaged velocity can be done. The
ascending zones are of same size, but ellipsoidal bubbles show higher values, especially in
the center. At the highest viscosity value, mixing time decreases again. This evolution
can be justiﬁed by a ﬂow transition from vortical ﬂow to double cell transition ﬂow as
described in section I.3. In this case, it is assumed that mixing is driven by the averaged
swarm velocity that is signiﬁcantly higher in the case of the membrane sparger. Besides,
bubble dispersion of both spargers is very similar in such viscous ﬂuids. Hence, mixing
is more eﬃcient in the case of the slugﬂow sparger in the considered ﬂow regime.
140III.8. Mass Transfer
III.8 Mass Transfer
It was already mentioned that oxygen probes are used to measure the dissolved
oxygen concentration in the liquid phase. In section III.1.1 results showed that
low frequency oscillations could be measured by this way. Now, one wants to go a
little further and determine characteristic mass transfer time scales. Therefore, the
KLavalue was determined like illustrated in section II.1.3.6. Then the inverse is taken
to obtain time scales as shown in table III.8 for water and in table III.9 for the other ﬂuids.

TABLEAU III.8: Mass Transfer Time Scales in Water
In ﬁgure III.53 all time scales from table III.8 are illustrated in graphical form.
Circles and stars indicate ellipsodial bubbles (membrane sparger) and spherical caps
(slugﬂow sparger), respectively. Both sparger types show decreasing time scales with
increasing ﬂow rate. At the lowest ﬂow rate the time scale diﬀerence is large, which can
be explained by diﬀerent interfacial areas of the considered bubble types. Indeed, with
decreasing size, the surface of any object is becoming larger compared to its volume.
With increasing ﬂow rate, time scales of both spargers are coming closer to each other,
which can another time be explained by the interfacial area. Last one is controled by the
bubble size distribution becoming more and more similar with increasing ﬂow rate. At
higher rates the membrane sparger generates large bubbles due to coalescence while the
slugﬂow sparger produces small bubbles near the injection, the free surface and during
break-ups. Plus, dissolved oxygen measurements are very long (of order of some hours).
This is enough time to induce enough small bubbles to establish regimes, which are close
to each other.

that Water and Breox ( 0:5%) show diﬀerent surface tensions, which is constant for all
Breox ﬂuids. Since mass transfer is very sensitive to the bubble size distribution, only
Breox ( 0:5%) is used for comparisons.
In line with the rest of our investigation, viscosity inﬂuences are studied again. Mass
transfer is inﬂuenced by many diﬀerent parameters like residence time, interface con-
tamination or shear forces to name only a few. Plus, all of them are coupled, which
illustrates how challenging it is to estimate mass transfer properly in such complex
situations. Nevertheless, the parameter is investigated to get at least an idea about mass
ﬂux inside the reactor. It is not surprising that with increasing viscosity mass transfer
time scales increases as well. This evolution is observed for both sparger types. Plus,
at every viscosity, a clear diﬀerence between the spargers can be seen. This diﬀerence
is becoming even larger with increasing viscosity, which can be explained by stabilizing
eﬀects on the interface. In the case of the membrane sparger bubble size distribution is
not changing signiﬁcantly. But for the slugﬂow sparger less and less small bubbles are
detected with increasing viscosity. Since this modiﬁcation decreases the mass transfer,
one assumes that the interfacial area is the driving term here as well.

h
In conclusion, it is diﬃcult to estimate the impact of hydrodynamic structures on
mass transfer in comparable ﬂow situations. The bubble size distribution is clearly the
driving term. To further investigate hydrodynamic inﬂuences, the bubble size should be
better controled.
III.9 Comparisons with 3D-BP
Instabilities like bubble plumes occur normaly in non conﬁned 3D situations such as
large tanks. Hence, it makes only sense to compare two and three dimensional ones
in order to approach real industrial conditions. Therefore, as mentioned in section
II.1.4, measurements on 3D-BP were performed. It is assumed that in both geometries
similar phenomena are acting and controling hydrodynamic structures involving that low
frequency oscillations should be of the same order. On the continuity of thought, six gas
injection ﬂow rates are chosen as it can be seen in table III.10.

143Chapter III. Experimental Results
The ﬁrst three ones represent the exact same gas ﬂow rate while the three last ones
correspond to the same superﬁcial gas velocities than for the 2D-BP. In this way, one
wants to ﬁgure out, which one of these two parameters is more important for bubble
plume oscillation characterization.
III.9.1 Oscillation Frequency
Measurements are performed in a cylindrical BC in order to analyse three dimensional
oscillations. One is looking for similarities between both conﬁgurations since physical
mechanisms should be the same. To follow such 3D oscillations, no visual metrological
methods can be applied, which is the reason for our research of another technique. It is
quit complex to follow bubble plume movements and to trust results if no look inside
the reactor is possible. First, analyzes of pressure signals were performed. This was
possible for simple cases in water, with membrane injection and moderate injection ﬂow
rates. But once large bubbles appear, the bubble plume is getting unstable. Diﬀerent
frequencies resulting from bubble coalescence and break-ups interfere with plume oscilla-
tions frequencies making the extraction of a characteristic frequency impossible. For this
reason, one had to rethink the experimental setup, which brang us to the HZDR and the
Wire-Mesh-system. This metrological method allows us to measure instantaneous void
fraction maps in a complet column cross section over time.
Wire-Mesh Wire-Mesh data was acquired for a large range of experimental conditions
in order to see if bubble plume motion occurs. The aim is still to follow the bubble plume
position in time. Therefore, the gravity center of the total gas holdup in the cross section
of the Wire-Mesh system, comparable to the gravity center from shadowgraphy images in
section II.1.3.2, is determined.
(xgc;ygc) =Pn
i=1(xi;yi)iPn

where (xi;yi)are the coordinates from every measuring point and iits local gas
fraction. Furthermore, because of the circular cross section, cartesian coordinates are
changed to polar ones by using the following equations:

Since it is our goal to identify low frequency oscillations, movements of the gravity
center are followed in time. Intuitively, the choice of following gcin time is coherent since
the helicoidal trajectory of the ascending bubbles is supposed to turn around the column
center.

TABLEAU III.11: Period Time Scales in Seconds
In table III.11 all periodic time scales from three dimensional measurements are
listed. In some cases, no characteristic frequency could be identiﬁed. However, for all
measurements a decreasing behaviour with increasing ﬂow rate is recognized. Theses
results are plotted in ﬁgure III.55. Full markers correspond to membrane and empty ones
to the slugﬂow sparger. All curves of ﬁgure III.55 show more or less the same decreasing
behaviour with increasing ﬂow rate. At this point no clear diﬀerences depending on
injection conditions or ﬂuid properties could be identiﬁed. Therefore, further treatments
must be performed. On the other hand, it is already possible to prove that low frequency
oscillations occur in three dimensional situations. Plus, the measured time scales are
of the same order of magnitude than in the case of 2D-BP. This means that the same
hydrodynamic mechanisms appear in both conﬁgurations.

III.9.2 Dimensionless Numbers
Dimensionless numbers are used to further compare the two and the three dimensional
case. At the beginning of this chapter diﬀerent possibilities are presented including our
proposition to use the Froude number. The application of our proposition is not possible
here because no detailed information about bubble size, shape and velocity is available.
Hence, it is impossible to base one dimensionless number directly on bubble characteris-
tics. This is why the classical numbers suggested by literature are used, involving that
only comparisons in water can be performed. The Strouhal and the Grashof number be-
ing both based on column characteristics are chosen. In ﬁgure III.56 both numbers as a
function of each other are plotted.
In the ﬁgure results from diﬀerent investigations are plotted. Two dimensional measure-
ments from (Diaz et al., 2006), (Pﬂeger & Becker, 2001), (Becker et al., 1994) and ours
are compared to our three dimensional ones and those from (Rensen & Roig, 2001). In
the three dimensional case, frequencies are smaller for the same Grashof number, which
is mainly inﬂuenced by the injection ﬂow rate. The diﬀerence can be explained by the
conﬁnement of the two dimensional bubble column hindering the generation of 3D-BPs.
This is not the case in cylindrical bubble columns where 3D-BP can develop. These three
dimensional instability waves show longer bubble trajectories that could be an explana-
tion for higher time scales. However, we were expecting our results to be rather in scale
146III.9. Comparisons with 3D-BP
with those from (Rensen & Roig, 2001) who used a three dimensional column as well. But
in contrast to ours, their column has a squared cross section. This geometry can hinder
meso scale phenomena like large eddies inﬂuencing bubble plume oscillations.

III.9.3 Bubble Dispersion
A last comparison is done by regarding gas hold-up proﬁles. In ﬁgure III.57 time averaged
void fractions of a single slice of the WIre-Mesh system are plotted in diﬀerent liquids
and for diﬀerent injection conditions. Membrane (left) and slugﬂow sparger (right) are
presented in water (top), Breox ( 13:6%) (middle) and Breox ( 18:5%) (bottom). To our
surprise the characteristic double peaks are identiﬁed in the case of the slugﬂow and
not for the membrane sparger. Since only one slide of the Wire-Mesh measurements is
used it is diﬃcult to estimate if the 3D-BP prefers one direction or if these double-peaks
really exist. Anyway, conclusions can be done concerning dispersion which increases with
increasing ﬂow rate being in agreement with 2D-BP measurements. It is interesting that
in the case of the membrane sparger for three intermediate ﬂow rates similar maximum
values in the center are found. In these conditions the bubble plume becomes only wider.
Furthermore, a clear decrease of the bubble width with increasing viscosity is observed.
This result is more obvious in the case of the slugﬂow sparger which is in agreement
with 2D-BP. Besides, at the highest viscosity, maximum values remain constant with
increasing ﬂow rate, but plume dispersion is increasing.

III.9.4 Conclusion
Diﬀerent similarities between the 2D-DP and the 3D-BP could be observed. Concerning
bubble plume wandering, comparable time scales of the same order of magnitude could
be measured. It is worth mentioning that 3D-BP are less organized. The less conﬁned
cylindrical column, but also the Wire-Mesh intrusivity can be the reasons. Concerning
last one, vortex cells being created at column top close to the free surface before
descending to the bottom, could be hindered by the mesh. Finally, similar evolutions of
void fraction proﬁles concerning ﬂow rate and viscosity inﬂuences, are observed. Only the
choice of the sparger type seems to be less important. This must be further investigated.
149Chapter III. Experimental Results
150Chapter IV
CFD
The aim of the present study, as in most chemical engineering investigations, is to develop
predictiv tools in order to eﬀectuate correct scale-ups and to ﬁnd optimum operation
conditions. All the experiments presented in the last chapters can serve to validate CFD
simulations, which will be the subject of this chapter. Therefore, a test case in water is
chosen to evaluate generally used closure terms between both phases such as drag, lift,
virtual mass and turbulent interactions.
IV.1 Modelling
The NEPTUNE CFD CODE is chosen to perfom CFD simulations. Several models are
available and those used for our case are presented in the following section. At this
point one wants to make clear that eventually better or more recent models are accessible
in literature. Anyway, the focus of this investigation is to try those models already
implemented in NEPTUNE CFD code.
IV.1.1 Two Fluid Model
The chosen CFD code works with an Euler-Euler approach to decrease calculation time
compared to tracking strategies like Lagrangian simulations. In this approach the media
is considered to be continous. Every cell of the mesh contains a certain percentage of gas
and liquid and only mixture momentum equations are solved.
151Chapter IV. CFD
Continuty Equations Naturally, conservation equations for mass and momentum
must be respected. Equations IV.1 and IV.4 illustrate these conservations for every phase
k. Relation IV.2 and IV.3 describe exchange terms between both phases.
@

@xj(kkUk;i) = k (IV.1)
where
 k=k(~UI ~Uk)~nkI (IV.2)
Equation IV.2 describes the mass transport if a normal component of the velocity
diﬀerence ( ~UI ~Uk) between the two phases exists. Then the mass transfer can be
expressed by  k. The momentum transfer is more delicate, as it can be seen in the
following equation:
@

with
LI;k= pkniIKI+ijknjIKI (IV.4)
The termUk;I kexpresses momentum transfer associated to the mass transfer  k.
The closure terms LI;krepresent diﬀusive momentum transfers between both phases
resulting from pressure and strain gradients. To establish a correct modeling of two
phase ﬂow, depending on the considered ﬂow regime, diﬀerent closure terms must be
taken into account as shown in section IV.1.2.
k Model
In chemical engineering it is generally admitted to use the k model to describ
turbulence in the continous phase. The idea is to relate velocity ﬂuctuations in the liquid
phase to the diﬀerence of the kinetic energy and viscous dissipation. This is expressed by
152IV.1. Modelling
equation IV.5:
 u0

It should be mentioned that the k model is isotropic, which can lead to uncertain-
ties. However, the turbulent viscosity can also be deﬁned in terms of kinetic energy and
energy dissipation:
t=Ck2
(IV.6)
Turbulent Interactions
In order to simulate turbulent interactions between the bubbles, the Tchen model
is available. The basic idea of this model is to relate both phases by their velocity
ﬂuctuations as follows:
u0
g;iu0
g;j=CTchenu0
l;iu0

where the coeﬃcient is deﬁned as:

oned:
r=t

Bubbles show a short relaxation time since their inertia is rather small. This can also
be described by the following equation:
d=2
3DE
k~Urk(IV.10)
153Chapter IV. CFD
which is smaller than one in our case. The second characteristic time scale, the
turbulent one, is expressed as a function of the kinetic energy and its dissipation:
t=kl
g(IV.11)
The second coeﬃcient is written in the following way:
b=1 +CAM
g
l+CAM(IV.12)
whereCAMcorresponds to the added mass coeﬃcient. This expression can be
simpliﬁed in the case of bubbles to:
b=1 +CAM
CAM(IV.13)
Finally, one can come back to the Tchen coeﬃcient. Two asymptotic cases can be
distinguished. For solid particles <1implyingt<d, one obtains:
CTchen =b2(IV.14)
For deformable particles r>1implyingt>d, one obtains:
CTchen1 (IV.15)
Bubbles correspond naturally to the second case since they are deformable.
IV.1.2 Closing Terms
Drag
In section I.1.3.2, a discussion about drag coeﬃcients depending on bubble shape size
was already given. In the applied CFD code, the following drag model is available:
~LD
g= 1
8AilCDjUg Ulj(~Ug ~Ul) (IV.16)

The drag coeﬃcient is calcutated automatically based on the local regime. The
empirical solution was given by (Ishii & Zuber, 1979):

To take into account the so called turbulent dispersion the drift ﬂux model already
mentioned in section I.1.3.4 can be implemented in the drag force. Instead of ~Ug ~Ul, the
term~Ug ~Ul ~UDis taken, where:
~UD=D~rg
g(IV.19)
As described in equation IV.19, the local void fraction gis taken into account to
calculate the real bubble velocity. Since void fraction gradients are mainly present in
horizontal direction, transverse velocities are generated by this correction. The ﬁnal drag
force can be written as:
~Ld
g= 1

The coeﬃcient of equation IV.19 was further deﬁned in the following way:

wherebandrcorrespond to equation IV.13 and IV.9, respectively.

Therefore, the number was slightly changed:

where the maximal horizontal expansion is taken instead of the equivalent bubble

whereEo, the Eötvös number is calculated with the equivalent bubble diameter.
Furthermore, three diﬀerent regimes depending on the modiﬁed Eötvös number can be
identiﬁed:

The lift coeﬃcient evolution depending on the modiﬁed Eötvös number is presented in
ﬁgure IV.1. In the chosen case a uniform bubble size of 5mmis set involving a constant
lift coeﬃcient of 0:27.
Added Mass
In this manuscript, it was pointed out that bubble motion is non stationary. This
means, since light particles like bubbles are considered, that the added mass force must
be taken into consideration. The force can be expressed by the following equation:

his chosen as test case for several reasons. First, bubble distribution is almost
monodispersed making calculations easier. Second, all experimental methods are rather
easy to apply generating very trustable results. And ﬁnally, water is considered to be the
most current ﬂuid in CFD simulations. By choosing this ﬂuid, potential errors due to
liquid properties can be avoided.
157Chapter IV. CFD
IV.2.1 Mesh
The studied hydrodynamic structure can be considered as low frequency instability wave
beingnonstationary. Innumericsanoscillatingmovementcanbeprovokedeasilybyirreg-
ularities of the mesh. In order to make sure that asymmetries in the mesh do not generate
any transverse movement, a mesh containing only quadrangles is chosen. Two diﬀerent
meshes were used to check the reﬁnement sensibility. The ﬁrst one contains 218400 cells
corresponding to a cell mean size of 53mm3and the second contains 2134080 cells with
a mean size of 2:33mm3. In both cases, special attention is given to the injection area.
One wanted to reproduce exactly the round injection oriﬁce of an inner diameter of 2cm.
To solve this problem a square is projected in the middle of the injection area as shown
in ﬁgure IV.2. In this way a perfectly symmetric mesh was generated for both resolutions.
Figure IV.2: Mesh of the Sparger Zone seen from the bottom with low (left) and high
(right) Resolution
It turned out that the two meshes produce the exact same results concerning the
global structure as well as local analyzes. Hence, only the mesh with the lower resolution
is used in the following in order to economize calculation time. Anyway, a friction
158IV.3. Results
condition with a logorithmic low for velocity calculations is used as boundary condition
at the wall. At the inlet, only gas is injected and at column top a degassing condition is
set. This means only gas can go through the outlet.
IV.2.2 Simulated Conditions
As already mentioned, a simple test case in water with membrane injection and a ﬂow
rate of 50l
hwas chosen. The convergent experimental diameter is 5mm. For the CFD
simulations a uniform equivalent diameter of the same size is taken. The associated
measured low frequency oscillation time scale is 28:2s.
IV.3 Results
The ﬁrst objective was to check if the global hydrodynamic structure of our CFD
simulation corresponds to the experiments. Therefore, only the drag force is chosen as
closure term. A comparison between a shadowgraphy image (of 0:7mof the column
height) and the gas fraction from simulations is shown in ﬁgure IV.3. It is clear that the
marcoscopic bubble plume shape is well reproduced by the CFD.
The second step is the veriﬁcation if the oscillating bubble plume behavior can be
simulated in the right frequnecy range. Hence, ﬂuctuations must be considered, no
matter in which phase. In the current case the vertical velocity of the gas phase is used
and recorded during 350sat several positions of the bubble column. The exact heights
are0:3m,0:6m,0:9mand 1:2m. But before treating the data signals, stationarity
must be studied. The overall averaged gas hold-up can serve to determine the moment
when quasi-stationarity is achieved. The exact gas hold-up evolution in time from the
numerical data is shown in ﬁgure IV.4. After 50sno large ﬂuctuations can be seen
anymore, which is why this moment is chosen to begin time series analyzes.

Figure IV.5: a) Raw Vertical Gas Velocities; b) Autocorrelation Functions; from four
diﬀerent Measurement Points
Time scales measured by all virtual sensors are identical, indicating that the low fre-
quency oscillation is consistent over the whole column height. This result is in agreement
with our measured pressure signals. Furthermore, all oscillation periods are in the right
time scale range proving that, even in absence of lift and added mass forces, the oscillat-
ing behaviour can be reproduced. However, the bubble size of the considered case is in
a range where bubbles are deformable and so where lift forces are acting. Plus, the ﬂow
regime is only quasi-stationary and bubbles show very low density compared to liquid.
Hence, added mass forces should be considered as well. For this reason four diﬀerent test
cases in the sense of closure terms are deﬁned and shown in table IV.1. The resulting
161Chapter IV. CFD
characteristic time scales are written in the last column. In all cases, the k and the
Tchen model are used to simulate turbulence in the liquid and gas phase, respectively.

TABLEAU IV.1: Closure Terms and Models with resulting Time Scales
By comparing the diﬀerent cases, one recognizes that the sensitivity to the closure
terms is rather weak. Gravity, drag und turbulence seem to be the most important
terms. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to see that the last case reproduces reality as best. It
illustrates the importance to take into account all mentioned forces that are supposed to
be involved in the current ﬂow regime. After validation of the hydrodynamic structure,
the analysis is conducted to more local comparisons. Therefore, void fraction proﬁles for
diﬀerent closure terms and experimental data are plotted in ﬁgure IV.6.
Figure IV.6: Void Fraction Proﬁle Comparison between Experimental and Numerical
Data for Diﬀerent Closure Terms
In the considered ﬁgure four curves belonging to numerical data (black) and two
curves from experimental data (orange) are shown. The diﬀerence between the orange
proﬁles is the way of volume calculation concerning COSIs. The dashed line (Treament 1)
corresponds to the choice taken in section II.1.3.3 (equation II.15, VEllipsoid =4
3mM2).
162IV.3. Results
The solid line (Treament 2) represents the second possibility where the volume of COSIs
and WIBs are calculated in the same way (equation I.5, VEllipsoid =4
3m2M). However,
two main conclusions can already be deduced from the obtained ﬁgure. First, one is
able to reproduce numerically the charecteristic bubble peak in the time averaged void
fraction of the considered case. Second, the proﬁle shape is rather insensitive to diﬀerent
combinations of closure terms. Furthermore, the choice of Treatment 1 seems not being
appropriate for the considered case. Indeed, half of the global void fraction results from
COSIs, which is why the way of volume calculation for COSIs has signiﬁcant importance
fortheaveragedvoidfractiondetermination. Therefore, Treatment2ischosentocompare
experimental and numerical data (both solid lines). Numerical simulations overestimates
the time averaged void fraction and slightly underestimates bubble dispersion. The ﬁrst
point may be explained by the fact that numerical data is taken in the very center on a
single slice where the gas hold-up may be higher than near the wall. Experimental data
is integrated over the whole column depth and overlapping bubble are current. These two
arguments may explain partially the observed gap. Nervertheless, the agreement between
both data sets is rather good and the proﬁle shape reproduced. To go further in our
analysis vertical velocities of liquid Uland gas phase Ugare studied. Figure IV.7 shows
ﬁrst one from the CFD simulation TC4 and from experimental measurements.
Figure IV.7: Liquid Velocity Proﬁle Comparison between Experimental and Numerical
Data
Regarding the liquid velocities, the agreement between CFD and experiments is rather
good, even if the numerical one is slightly underestimated, especially in the donwcomer
163Chapter IV. CFD
part. The diﬀerence between the maximum velocity of the riser ( 3:55cm
s) and downcomer
(2:59cm
s) indicates stronger three dimensional eﬀects in the case of the simulated liquid
velocity. Indeed, by integrating the velocity over the whole horizontal axis, one does not
obtain zero meaning that mass balance is not met in the considered two dimensional plane
as it is the case in our experiments.
Figure IV.8: Gas Velocity Proﬁle Comparison between Experimental and Numerical Data
Figure IV.8 shows the comparison of the rising gas velocity between numerical and
experimental data. To achieve this correctly, the velocity must be calculated in a similar
way than in equation II.19:
Ug=NP
i=1giUbi
NP
i=1gi(IV.29)
Similar to section II.25 where the gas velocity is determined for every spatial interval,
the numerical one is calculated for every mesh. However, the shape of the experimental
curve could be well reproduced as it can be seen in ﬁgure IV.8. Maximums and mini-
mums are located at same positions at 0:4and0:95, respectively, suggesting that
hydrodynamics are simulated in a correct way. On the other hand, a gap between both
data sets is observed. This result is in line with the overestimated void fraction shown in
ﬁgure IV.6 and can be explained by at least two reasons. In section I.1.3.4 it was already
shown that swarm eﬀects can decrease the drag coeﬃcient which necessarily results in
164IV.3. Results
a veclocity increase. This eﬀect is furtherd by a phenomenon, called bulk formation.
It means that objects (here bubbles) agglomerate generating low pressure zones in its
wake. Hence, bubbles rising behind the bulk, accelerate signiﬁcantly. In smaller bubble
columns such observations are called intermittencies. The second explanation is a little
more abstract. In the moment when the bubble plume comes close to the wall changing
the direction, a decceleration and a recceleration is observed. At this moment, the added
mass force may generate a streamwise acceleration component meaning that at this
typical moment an increase of the gas velocity can be observed.
Figure IV.9: Flow Rate Proﬁle Comparison between Experimental and Numerical Data
Finally, the ﬂow rate calulated via Ugandgis compared to the injected one jgas
shown in ﬁgure IV.9. Again, the simulated case TC4and experimental data from our
two treatments are plotted in order to analyze bubble diﬀusion. Obviously, the CFD
simulation is not capable to reproduce correctly the shape of the experimental ﬂow rate
proﬁle. Furthermore, the qualitative shape of the considered proﬁle is independent of
our treatment to calculate volumes of COSI’s. To understand which treatment is better
adapted, one must integrate the considered curves over whole horizontal axis. At best
the result should be equal or close to one, but this is only the case for our experimental
data with treatment 2. In one way or another, one is able to recognize that the numerical
proﬁle shape does not match with the experimental one. This means that improvements
concerning bubble diﬀusion must be done.
165Chapter IV. CFD
Anyway, the bubble plume ﬂow regime of the considered test case could be well
reproduced by CFD simulations. The hydrodynamic structure as well as the oscillation
frequency matches almost perfectly. On the other hand, gaps between local numerical
and experimental data indicate the need of model improvements. Drag and turbulent
interaction seem to be the dominant terms, which is why other corresponding models,
available in literature, should be checked. Furthermore, CFD simulations must be
extended to other test cases. A ﬁrst step could be the simulation of bubble plumes with
large spherical caps in water. Then, the impact of liquid property modiﬁcations can be
studied, which is even more usefull for industrial applications.
166Conclusion and Perspectives
Conclusion
The present work investigated hydrodynamics, mass tranfer and mixing induced by
quasi two dimensional bubble plumes. Especially, the oscillating behaviour was in focus.
The deeper aim is to understand same phenomena induced by single spot spargers in
large bioreactors. Hence, the acquisition of a large databank is reported. A large number
of metrological methods was presented such as PIV, BIV, shadowgraphy, mixing time
determination as well as time signals from pressure sensors and oxygen probes. In this
way, diﬀerent analyzes relating temporal and spatial scales could be performed. Several
time scales for bubble plume oscillations, mass transfer and mixing are presented. Liquid
and bubble velocities in function of ﬂuid properties are reported as well, in terms of
mean value, organized motion, bubble induced agitation and turbulence.
Diﬀerent inﬂuences from spargers and liquid properties were studied. It turned out
that in water sparger inﬂuence is rather small on bubbe plume oscillations, but large
for mass transfer and mixing times. The same observation was done for surface tension
inﬂuences. Furthermore, viscosity impact in the range of 1 100mPason diﬀerent
time scales was analyzed. Results showed that the choice of the sparger becomes
more important with increasing viscosity. Dispersion and oscilallation frequencies are
dependent on sparger types. For example it was presented that viscosity has inﬂuence
on the oscillation frequency in the case of membrane sparger, but not in the case of the
slugﬂow sparger. Strong coupling between bubble size, velocity and the oscillating be-
haviour was presented. As expected, bubble dispersion decreases with increasing viscosity.
167Conclusion and Perspectives
Besides, diﬀerent evolutions of mass tranfer and mixing time scales with increasing
viscosity are reported. While the mass transfer is decreasing, the analysis of mixing time
scales as a function of viscosity remains tricky. This illustrates that diﬀerent phenomena
can dominate bubble plume ﬂows depending on ﬂuid properties. Finally, oscillation time
scale comparisons were done with three dimensional measurements performed at the
HZDR in Dresden. Similar frequencies in both geometries were found which shows the
beneﬁt of pseudo two dimensional analysis.
In the last chapter, preliminary three dimensional numerical results are presented for
one test case using NEPTUNE CFD. Diﬀerent closure terms between phases were tested
in order to validate numerical results by comparison to oscillating time scales and void
fraction proﬁles. It turned out that drag as well as lift and added mass terms must be
taken into account to simulate bubble plume oscillation as close as possible to reality.
Perspectives
The last point of the conclusion should also be the starting point of future works. The
large databank is giving the possibility to simulate a large range of several conditions
and compare them to experimental results. First, injection conditions such as ﬂow rates
and sparger types should be investigated numerically. Therefore, the rather recent Large
Interface Model (LIM) developped in NEPTUNE CFD could be used in order to simulate
spherical cap bubbles. Then, liquid properties like surface tension and viscosity with the
LIM must be investigated.
Liquid velocity ﬁelds should be used to go further in POD analyzes. For example, spatial
intercorrelations could provide information about vortex size depending on their energy
contribution. PIV measurements were also performed on small acquisition windows
which could serve to investigate viscous dissipation.
A large analysis concerning bubble velocities can also be performed from Bubble Image
Velocimetry (BIV) measurements. Velocity of each bubble can be related to other
characteristics like eccentricity, solidity or size. In this way, bubble behaviour depending
on their characteristics in bubble swarms can be investigated. With all the information
about gas and liquid velocity, void fraction proﬁles as well as bubble shape and size,
interfacial area and then mass tranfer should be studied in detail.
