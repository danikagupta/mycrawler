Status epilepticus1 
RichardJ. Lederman, M.D., Ph.D. Status epilepticus (SE), defined as clinical or electrical seizures 
continuing for at least 30 minutes, occurs in a minority of patients 
with epilepsy and is more common in symptomatic than in idi-
opathic forms. In adults, brain tumor, trauma, and stroke account 
for a substantial proportion of cases, whereas in children, various 
infectious processes, toxic or metabolic disorders, and chronic 
encephalopathies may be found. SE is often precipitated by sudden 
withdrawal of anticonvulsant drugs or intercurrent infection. Pro-
longed seizures lead to a series of metabolic derangements which 
may subsequently cause neuronal damage. Therapy aimed at pre-
venting this sequence of events includes general measures, such as 
ensuring sufficient oxygenation, maintaining adequate blood pres-
sure, and preventing hyperthermia or hypoglycemia. Specific an-
ticonvulsant drug therapy is reviewed, including recommended 
doses, mode and rate of administration, and potential hazards.

Copyright© 1984 by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation The term "status epilepticus" (SE) was first used by 
Calmeil in 1824 to describe a succession of uninterrupted 
epileptic attacks, a condition clearly perceived to be life-
threatening. 1 Although epilepsy has been known for more 
than 4,000 years, SE has been recognized for only a few 
hundred years and seems to have become a disorder of 
major clinical importance only since the introduction of 
bromide therapy in 1861.2 The implications of this asso-
ciation were emphasized by Hunter. 
Definition and incidence 
The generally accepted definition of SE is that of a

seizure which "persists for a sufficient length of 
time or is repeated frequently enough to produce 
a fixed and enduring epileptic condition."4 In 
practical terms, SE is said to exist when clinical 
or electrical seizures continue for at least 30 
minutes, usually (although not invariably) associ-
ated with unconsciousness which persists for the 
duration of the seizures. Two major types are 
recognized: convulsive and non-convulsive. Con-
vulsive SE may be generalized from the outset, 
or secondarily after focal onset; this is the most 
common type and also the most ominous. Motor 
activity is usually bilateral, and in adults, gener-
ally includes both tonic and clonic phases. Pure 
tonic SE is common in children or adolescents, 
while pure clonic SE is seen only in infants and 
young children. SE may rarely be myoclonic, and 
persistently focal (e.g., unilateral) SE may also be 
seen. Non-convulsive forms include partial SE 
(both simple and complex types) and so-called 
absence or petit mal seizures. Neonatal SE most 
often consists of either  irregular and frequently 
subtle motor phenomena or else recurring tonic 
contractions. 
The true frequency of SE is difficult to judge 
from the literature. Hunter3 identified it in 1.3% 
of all  admissions to the National Hospital at 
Queen Square. Oxbury and Whitty5 found 166 
cases of SE among the 2,500 patients with epi-
lepsy admitted to the United Oxford Hospitals 
(6.6%). Janz'' reported encountering at least one 
episode of SE in 95 of 2,588 patients (3.7%) with 
epilepsy, and Celesia7 identified it in 60 out of 
2,290 cases (2.6%). SE is much more common in 
patients whose epilepsy has a demonstrable cause. 
Janz6 wrote that SE occurred in 9% of those with 
"symptomatic" epilepsy and 1.6% of those with the idiopathic type. In nearly all  reported series, 
patients with symptomatic or secondary epilepsy 
represent a disproportionate fraction of the total 
number. Rowan and Scott8 reported SE as the 
initial manifestation of epilepsy in only 5 of their 
42 patients (12%), while Hauser9 identified 132 
of 1,047 epileptic patients (12.6%) in whom SE 
was the presenting event. On the other hand, in 
28% of the patients in Oxbury and Whitty's 
series5 and 56% of Roger and associates' series,10 
SE was the initial ictal event. In children, this 
sequence of events appears to be even more 
common, including 77% of Aicardie and Chev-
rie's patients." SE is only occasionally the initial 
ictal event in idiopathic epilepsy in all adult series, 
and if febrile status is considered within the symp-
tomatic group, in children as well. 
Pathogenesis 
In discussing the pathogenesis of SE, it is im-
portant to distinguish between the underlying 
causes and the precipitating factors. Statistics 
from seven reported series are collated in Table 
1, though they should be compared with caution 
because of differences in patient populations and 
presentation of data. Brain tumors, craniocere-
bral trauma, and cerebrovascular disease repre-
sent clearly identifiable causes in a substantial 
group of adults, whereas acute infections, toxic 
or metabolic disorders, and a variety of chronic 
encephalopathies of congenital or perinatal ori-
gin comprise a large percentage of infants and 
children with SE. With respect to the possibility 
of drug treatment as a precipitating factor in SE, 
Hunter3 found that 23% of episodes of SE in his 
patients could be attributed to a change in med-
ication and 30% to intercurrent infection and

suggested that SE is precipitated by acute infec-
tion only in patients on anticonvulsants. Janz6 
ascribed 14/110 episodes of SE to drug with-
drawal and 23/110 to infection. Similarly, Rowan 
and Scott8 considered 13 out of 50 episodes in 
their series to be drug-related and 9 out of 50 to 
be precipitated by acute systemic infection. In 
Aminoff and Simon's series,12 28% of all  episodes 
of SE and 53% of those in patients with a history 
of seizures were thought to be related to a change 
in anticonvulsant drug regimen.  Only 4 out of 
98 patients in their series had intracranial infec-
tion. 
Before turning to the management of SE, we 
should consider the pathophysiology of sustained 
epilepsy and its effect on the brain. Analysis of 
the metabolic and circulatory changes occurring 
during seizures in humans has been hampered by 
both technical and ethical considerations. Studies 
such as those by Posner et al13 have demonstrated 
that cerebral metabolism increases markedly dur-
ing seizure activity, and with it, the need for 
substrates and oxygen. Their data suggest that if 
the supply of oxygen  and glucose to the brain 
could be maintained during a seizure and the 
metabolic effects of muscle hyperactivity miti-
gated, neuronal damage migbt be prevented. 
However, this has not proved to be  true in all 
cases, since even a prolonged focal discharge may 
induce localized neuronal changes14 or clinical 
sequelae.15 Newer techniques such as positron 
emission tomography or magnetic resonance 
scanning may provide additional information. 
Similar results have been obtained using ani-
mal models such as that developed by Meldrum 
and Horton."1 When prolonged seizures were 
induced in adolescent baboons or rats using the 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitor bi-
cuculline or other toxins, a predictable sequence 
of events occurred during sustained  epilepsy. 
Changes seen during the first 20 minutes in-
cluded arterial hypertension, marked increases in 
cerebral blood flow, substantial increases in ce-
rebral metabolic rate, diminished cerebral arte-
riovenous POa and PC02, lactic acidemia with 
systemic acidosis, and hyperglycemia after a brief 
and usually mild initial drop in blood glucose. 
The late phase, seen after 25 minutes of contin-
uous seizure activity, was characterized by  hypo-
glycemia, hyperthermia, mild arterial hypoten-
sion, mild hypoxemia, hyperkalemia, and nor-
malization of arterial pH. Cerebral hyperme-
tabolism was maintained, though at a slightly 
lower level; cardiovascular collapse tended to occur during this phase, if at all. Neuronal dam-
age also seemed to be produced during this later 
phase,17 suggesting that the factors involved in 
its pathogenesis (singly or in combination) were 
hyperpyrexia, arterial hypotension, hypoxia, and 
hypoglycemia. It has been proposed that this 
neuronal damage may depend upon the intracel-
lular oxidative mechanisms which accompany in-
tense electrical activity, perhaps resulting in free 
radical accumulation, and that this series of 
events may be triggered by excess intracellular 
calcium. 
Neuropathological changes in these animal 
models bear a striking resemblance to those 
which for many years have been known to occur 
in humans with long-standing and often poorly 
controlled epilepsy or in those who died following 
SE. Gross changes are often meager, revealing 
only mild brain swelling and some vascular 
congestion. Microscopic abnormalities usually oc-
cur primarily in the middle neuronal layers of 
the neocortex, the hippocampus (particularly the 
pyramidal cells of Sommer's sector), and the Pur-
kinje cell layer of the cerebellum. Changes are 
representative  of severe hypoxic and ischemic 
damage, including neuronal atrophy with cyto-
plasmic eosinophilia. The nuclei are usually hy-
perchromatic and shrunken, and astrocytic and 
microglial proliferation is observed.19 
Therapy 
The studies described above help to provide a 
rational basis for the design of a therapeutic 
approach to SE, with the goal of preventing the 
pathological changes characteristic of hypoxia 
and ischemia as well as the attendant clinical 
sequelae. Diagnosis and therapy must proceed 
simultaneously and without delay. If there is a 
single point of agreement throughout the litera-
ture, it is that the prognosis of SE depends largely 
on the time  between onset of continuous seizure 
activity and initiation of therapy. Persistence of 
convulsive (or perhaps non-convulsive) SE for 
more than 60 minutes is generally considered to 
result in irreversible neuronal damage. Although 
it is the deleterious effects of prolonged convul-
sions that have been demonstrated  most clearly, 
all forms of SE should be controlled as quickly as 
possible. 
The circumstances of presentation obviously 
influence management, both in a diagnostic sense 
and to a lesser extent in therapy.  Nevertheless, 
certain guidelines can be offered. Therapeutic 
intervention can be divided into general and

specific anticonvulsant measures, as outlined in 
Table 2. Initial treatment must be aimed at pro-
viding satisfactory ventilation, maintaining ade-
quate cardiac output and cerebral perfusion, and 
preventing further injury as the direct result of 
the violent motor activity. Excessive elevations of 
body temperature must be prevented as well. 
Patients in SE will generally require tracheal 
intubation; at times, usually as an initial measure, 
an oral airway may suffice. Oxygen is adminis-
tered by nasal cannula or mask if the patient is 
not intubated. Systemic blood pressure must be 
maintained; pressors are rarely required, but in-
travenous fluids are often critical, especially in 
children. A sturdy intravenous line should be 
inserted immediately, while at the same time 
taking blood for chemical screening and testing 
an arterial sample for pH and P02. I generally 
take several extra tubes of blood for toxic screen-
ing and measurement of anticonvulsant drug lev-
els, at least in older children and adults. This 
additional blood loss is unlikely to be detrimental, 
and the availability of frozen serum may save 
much grief and self-recrimination when a more 
leisurely inquiry is possible. As soon as blood has 
been withdrawn, a bolus of 50 mL of 50% glucose 
(or 2 mL/kg in a child) is rapidly infused, fol-
lowed by maintenance fluids. Since accurate as-sessment of fluid balance is critical in  SE, a blad-
der catheter is generally required. Hyperthermia 
must be treated aggressively and immediately. 
Specific therapy consists primarily of anticon-
vulsant drugs, although  diagnostic studies may 
reveal causative factors such as magnesium, cal-
cium, hypertonic saline, or bicarbonate which call 
for specific measures. Such drugs must be given 
with the goal of immediately achieving and then 
maintaining a seizure-free state. They are admin-
istered intravenously in almost all cases, as the 
urgency of the situation and the uncertainty of 
absorption by other routes override any increase 
in risk if, of course, the physician administering 
the therapy is thoroughly familiar with the drugs 
used. 
Of the three types of drugs usually selected for 
initial therapy, I generally favor benzodiazepines, 
either a 5-10-mg bolus of diazepam (0.3 mg/kg 
in infants and children) or lorazepam (2-4 mg; 
0.05-0.2 mg/kg); while larger amounts may oc-
casionally be required, most patients respond to 
less than 40 mg of diazepam or 15-20 mg of 
lorazepam. These drugs take effect quickly— 
often within one or two minutes—but this effect 
may also be short-lived, particularly with diaze-
pam; therefore maintenance therapy with an-
other drug, generally phenytoin, should be insti-

tuted more or less simultaneously with diazepam. 
A constant intravenous infusion of diazepam has 
also been advocated if initial bolus treatment 
fails."0 I dilute diazepam in 5% dextrose and 
water (100 mg/500 mL) and administer it at a 
fate of 8 mg/hr. Major side effects of the ben-
zodiazepines include respiratory (and occasion-
ally cardiac) depression or arrest and hypoten-
sion, especially in infants and elderly patients, 
and prior barbiturate treatment may markedly 
increase the risk of respiratory arrest. 
The second drug being considered here is phe-
nytoin, which is recommended by some for acute 
as well as more long-lasting control of seizures. I 
recommend a dose of  15-18 mg/kg (800-1,200 
mg for most adults) and a rate of no more than 
50 mg/min. At this dosage, therapeutic blood 
levels are achieved within five minutes, and sei-
zure activity usually diminishes  or ceases alto-
gether before the infusion is even completed. In 
addition, phenytoin affords less sedation and is 
effective longer than diazepam. Although it can 
cause cardiac arrest or hypotension, this is rarely 
a serious problem if the above recommended rate 
of administration is followed. Maintenance doses 
of 5 mg/kg per day are continued once control 
is achieved. 
The third drug commonly used for SE is phé-
nobarbital. I favor 5-10 mg/kg (generally 200-
400 mg for adults) over a 10-15-minute period. 
Although the half-life of phénobarbital is long, 
high brain and plasma levels are reached within 
several minutes and seizures are generally con-
trolled during the initial infusion. A repeat dose 
may be given if necessary within 20-30 minutes; 
however, the full initial dosage of 15 mg/kg is 
generally given within the first four to 12 hours. 
Phénobarbital seems to be the initial treatment 
of choice in neonatal SE, with loading doses of 
20 mg/kg required.21,22 In most patients, main-
tenance doses (5 mg/kg per day) are begun after 
12 to 24 hours. Sedation and some respiratory 
suppression are virtually certain, and routine en-
dotracheal intubation  is recommended. 
If seizures persist despite the above drugs, 
there are a number of secondary anticonvulsants 
which can be used, including paraldehyde  and 
lidocaine, before resorting to general anesthesia. 
Paraldehyde can be given in a dose of 1 -3 mL as 
a 4% solution in normal saline over a period of 
10 to 30 minutes; a less satisfactory alternative is 
3-5 mL by deep intramuscular injection or per 
rectum diluted 2:1 in cottonseed oil. Although I 
have given as much as 40 mL of intravenous paraldehyde safely over a 24-hour period, such a 
dose is potentially dangerous and not generally 
recommended. Toxic side effects include pul-
monary hemorrhage or edema, cardiac failure, 
hepatitis, and nephrosis, and maintenance ther-
apy with another drug should be instituted as 
soon as control is obtained. Paraldehyde may be 
the treatment of choice in SE associated with 
alcohol withdrawal.23 Intravenous infusions of 
lidocaine in doses of 3-10 mg/kg per hour may 
sometimes be highly effective in establishing con-
trol of SE.23 It is  generally added to 5% dextrose 
and water for infusion; additional boluses  of 50-
100 mg may be given intravenously. I have given 
up to 4,000 mg over 24 hours with impunity, but 
it must be recognized that seizures or even car-
diopulmonary arrest can be precipitated by high 
doses. Maintenance therapy with a standard an-
ticonvulsant is required once seizures are con-
trolled. Other drugs which have been reported 
to be useful in isolated situations include valproic 
acid (given via a nasogastric tube or per rec-
tum),2 alfaxalone,25 and chlormethiazole.23,26 
When the drug regimens outlined above fail, 
general anesthesia may be required to minimize 
the metabolic sequelae of prolonged seizure ac-
tivity or suppress the process permanently. Un-
fortunately, few clear and reliable guidelines re-
garding depth or duration of anesthesia are avail-
able, and there are few data regarding the advan-
tages of inhalation versus intravenous agents. 
Opitz et al27 have suggested that halothane or 
enflurane are the preferred  inhalation agents in 
epileptic patients, while Goldberg and Mc-
Intyre28 have proposed a protocol for use of 
intravenous pentobarbital. 
Despite the number of potent and relatively 
safe drugs available today, SE remains a serious 
and life-threatening condition. A major factor in 
prognosis is delay in instituting effective anticon-
vulsant therapy. Overall, some 30%-50% of 
adults will die within six months of the first 
episode, either as a  direct result of SE (or its 
treatment) or the underlying disease process. 
Since death among symptomatic patients is much 
more common, underlying illness is probably the 
second most important factor in prognosis next 
to delay in treatment. In Celesia's series,7 for 
example, there were no deaths among the 15 
patients with primary epilepsy and only 1 among 
the 8 with idiopathic epilepsy; in contrast, 15 of 
the 37 symptomatic patients (40%) died, 4 as a 
direct result of SE and 11 from the underlying 
disease. Aminoff and Simon12 noted that 16 of 
 on August 29, 2024. For personal use only. All other uses require permission. www.ccjm.org Downloaded from 2*266 Cleveland Clinic Quarterly Vol. 51, No. 2 
their 92 patients with SE died, death being due 
to the primary pathological process in 14 cases. 
Among children,  similar dismal results have been 
reported. In Aicardie and Chevrie's series,11 27 
of 239 patients (11%) died and 88 (37%) had a 
significant  residual neurological deficit, although 
some of these problems had been present before 
SE. Morbidity is also high among adults. Thus at 
present there are neither satisfactory answers to 
the nature of the electrochemical events in SE 
nor an ideal treatment. Only time will tell 
whether new drugs and improved understanding 
of the pathophysiology and treatment of SE will 
alter the currently unsatisfactory statistics.
