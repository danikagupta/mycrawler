 Abstract  
 The goal of  the study was to check the possible use of halloysite nanotubes as a 
controlled release natural antioxidant device with quercetin as the active component. The 
mineral was thoroughly characterized by various techniques including the determination of 
partic le and tube morphology, specific surface area, pore size and volume, as well as surface 
energy. The high surface energy of halloysite pr edicted strong adsorption of active  
molecules on its surface and consequently difficult release. FTIR spectroscopy confi rmed 
the existence of strong interaction s, energetically heterogeneous halloysite surface and 
multilayer coverage at large loading s. FTIR and XRD experiments proved the complete lack 
of intercalation and showed that below 3.5 wt% quercetin loading , most of  the molecules 
are located within the halloysite tubes. Molecular modelling indicated the parallel 
orientation of quercetin molecules with the surface. Critical concentrations derived from 
various measurements agreed well with each other further confirming  that up to about 4.0 
wt% loading, quercetin is bonded very strongly to the halloysite surface. As a consequence, 
the dissolution of active molecules is very difficult or impossible, especially into apolar 
media, thus neither stabilizatio n nor  controlled r elease effect can be expected below that 
concentration.  
 
1. Introduction  
 Active molecules are often loaded onto carrier materials for variou s reasons. 
Supports may help  homogeneous distribution in a matrix or occasionally they may provide  
a controlled release function as well. Controlled release is increasingly important in many 
fields of applications, mainly in drug delivery, but also in other areas. A wide variety of 
nanomaterials are used to achieve the controlled release function. Cyclod extrin, a cyclic 
oligosaccharide  containing a number of hydrogen donor and acceptor groups a nd an internal 3 
 lipophobic surface , can host various molecules in its cavity and is frequently used in delivery 
systems [ 1]. Various natural and synthetic polymers l ike liposomes, polymer micelles, 
nanoparticles and nanogels are available  as controlled release carriers, but  porous 
nanoparticles and various nanofillers with tubular structure  are also often used as supports  
in such applications.  
 Besides titanium dioxid e and carbon nanotubes, halloysite nanotubes are also good 
potential carriers for active molecules, and were claimed to offer controlled release function 
as well  [2-15]. As a consequence, numerous attempts were made to use them for controlled 
drug deliver y, but also in other applications. Shchuckin et al. [ 3], for example, developed a 
corrosion inhibitor coating in which the inhibitor was placed inside halloysite nanotubes and 
the release of the active component o ccurred in a controlled way. Liu  and Zhao [ 16] 
achieved catalytic action by the adsorption of silver nanoparticles on to the surface of 
halloysite, while Xie [ 17] prepared magnetic nanotubes in a similar way. The large and high 
energy surface of halloysite is frequently used also to bind various mole cules, especially in 
water treatment and purification  [18, 19]. Most of these applications require a detailed 
knowledge of halloysite morphology and surface properties, but the mineral is rarely 
characterized in detail. Particle characteristics, surface ar ea, pore size and volume, as well 
as surface energy are rarely determined, although they must influence both the adsorption 
and release of active molecules.  
 Polyolefins, including pol yethylene (PE), usually contain  a phenolic antioxidant to 
provide both processing and long term stability. Although the type and amount of the 
stabilizer may vary with the application area, its presence is p ractically inevitable. 
Unfortunately, approximately a decade ago , concerns arose  about the possible health hazard 
of using synthetic phenolic antioxidants [ 20], but no viable substitute has been found yet. 
Nature supplies a number of compounds with considerable antioxidant effect, vitamin E 4 
 being the best known representative used als o in practice [ 21-24]. Quercetin is a natural 
flavonoid with proven antioxidant, antiviral and anti -inflammatory effect which also proved 
to be a very efficient stabilizer  in PE [ 25]. However, besides its advantages, the compound 
has several drawbacks as w ell. Its melting temperature is around 32 0 °C , well above the 
processing temperature of PE, its solubility in the polymer is very small and it gives PE a 
very strong yellow color. Using a solid support to distribute quercetin in PE may improve 
homogeneity considerably. Halloysite seemed to be an obvious choice as carrier material 
and possible controlled release effect could be an additional bonus. However, the adsorption 
and release of an active molecule f rom the surface depends on a large number  of factors  
including the characteristics of the halloysite and those of the surrounding medium.  
 Accordingly, the goal of our study was to characterize the halloysite used as 
thoroughly as possible, determine its interactions with the active molecule and identify th e 
location of this latter on or inside the filler , if possible. We wanted to determine the amount 
of adsorbed quercetin , as well as the kinetics of adsorption. Preliminary calculations and 
modelling were carried out to estimate the arrangement of quercetin  molecules on the 
surface of the mineral and to predict possible consequences.  
 
2. Experimental  
 The quercetin used in the study was obtained from Sigma -Aldrich, USA  and used as 
received. Its molecular weight is 302,24 g/mol , melting temperature 316 °C and purity >95 
%. The molecular structure of quercetin is presented in Scheme 1 . The halloysite used in 
the experiments was obtained from Applied Minerals (USA). Its particle size was 
determined in ethanol suspension after sonication for 60 min using a  Horiba Partica 
LA950V2  particle size analyzer. Particle characteristics were also determined by the image 
analysis of transmission electron micrographs (TEM) recorded with the help of a FEI 5 
 Morgagni 268D apparatus. Average values of external and internal diameter as well as the 
length of the tubes were derived from the measurement of more than 7 0 individual tubes. 
Specific surface area, pore size and volume were measured using a NOVA 2000  
(Quantachrome, USA) apparatus. The measurements were done at -195 °C  after evacuating 
the sample at 120  °C for 24 hours down to 10-5 Hgmm.  
 The surface energy of the tubes was determined by infinite dilution inverse gas 
chromatography (IGC). The filler was agglomerated with water and the 250-400 m fraction 
was used for the packing of the column. The dispersion component of surface tension was 
determined by the injection of n -alkanes at various temperatures between 160 and 300 C, 
because of the high surface energy of the mineral. Only one polar pr obe molecule, benzene, 
could be eluted from the surface of the mineral  between 280 and 300 °C , thus the polar 
component of surface tension could be determined only with large uncertainty.  
 The adsorption kinetics of quercetin onto the halloysite nanotubes  was studied in 
suspension. Quercetin was dissolved in ethanol to prepare a solution of 0.03-2.00 g/dm3 
concentration. Halloysite was added subsequently and sonicated for 60 min, evacuated at 
300 mbar pressure and then sonicated again for 15 min to remove the air from the tubes. 
The halloysite content of the dispersion was 10 g/dm3 in each case. After predetermined 
adsorption times the slurry was centrifuged and the concentration of quercetin in the solution 
was determined by UV -VIS spectroscopy from the in tensity of the adsorption peak 
appearing at 374 nm. The adsorption of quercetin was determined also by a dissolution 
method [ 26, 27] described more in detail elsewhere [ 28]. During the discussion of the results 
the quercetin content of the samples is prese nted in wt% , i.e. the amount of quercetin related 
to the weight of the halloysite. This unit allows the comparison of all results on the same 
scale including those of the adsorption experiments and the ones obtained on dry halloysite 
samples.  6 
  The interaction of quercetin with halloysite was studied with Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Measurements were done both in transmission and in diffuse 
reflectance (DR IFT) mode. Potassium bromide pastilles containing ~0.4 wt% halloysite 
were p repared for the first technique, while dried powder was used in the second. The 
spectra were recorded in 16 scans by 2  cm-1 resolution  in both cases. Q uercetin adsorption 
was followed also by  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The spectra w ere recorde d 
using a Thermo Scientific K -Alpha (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK)  spectrometer equipped 
with a micro -focused, monochromatic AlK  X-ray source (1486.6 eV). An X -ray beam of 
400 m size was used at 6 mA and  12 kV. The spectra were acquired in the constant a nalyzer 
energy mode with the pass energy of 200 eV for the survey. Narrow regions were collected 
using the snapshot acquisition mode (150 eV pass energy), enabling rapid collection of data 
(5 s per region).  Charge compensation was achieved with the system flood gun that provides 
low energy electrons (~0 eV) and low energy argon ions (20 eV) from a single source. The 
argon partial pressure was 2x10–7 mbar in the analysis chamber. The Thermo Scientific 
Avantage  software, version 5.948 (Thermo Fisher Scientific , UK ), was used for digital 
acquisition and data processing. Spectral calibration was determined by using the automated 
calibration routine and the internal Au, Ag and Cu standards supplied with the K -Alpha  
system. The surface compositions (in atomic %) were determined by the consideration of  
the integrated peak areas of the detected atoms and the respective sensitivity factors. The 
fractional concentration of a particul ar element A was computed using Eq. 1

where In and sn are the integrated peak areas and the Scofield sensitivity factors , 
respectively,  correcte d for the analyzer transmission . The possible intercalation of quercetin 
into interlayer space was studied by X -ray diffraction  (XRD) . The patterns were rec orded 7 
 using a Phillips PW 1830  equipment with CuK  radiation at 40 kV and 35 mA in reflection 
mode.  
 The theoretical amount of quercetin which can be introduced into the voids within 
the tubes was estimated from pore  volumes determined in different ways. Preliminary 
molecular modelling was carried out to estimate the strength of quercetin/halloysite 
interaction and the arrangement of the molecules on the surface of halloysite. Since  accurate 
experimental geometry for halloysite nanotubes is  not available,  theoretical investigations 
were performed using the kaolinite clay min eral of similar structure as  model system. The 
lattice parameters and atomic positions determined by low -temperature neutron powder 
diffraction by Bish [ 29] were used in the calculations . The Mercury [ 30] package was used 
for the construction of the crystal structures from the experimental parameters. The size of 
the monolayer model was ~15x25 Å and the free valences were replaced by hydrogen atoms. 
The geometry optimization of quercetin was carried out at the density functional theory  
(DFT) level using the M06 -2X [ 31] functional and the 6 -31++G** [ 32] basis set. 
Subsequently we generated 50 -50 initial structures randomly placing the quercetin molecul e 
on both sides of the crystal. Concerning the position of the quercetin molecule with respect 
to the surfaces in both cases the generated orientations included approximately 25 parallel 
and 25 perpendicular ones. The geometry optimization of the complexes  were performed by 
molecular mechanics (MM) using the universal force field (UFF) [ 33] freezing all atomic 
positions in  the crystal. The Gaussian 09 [ 34] package was used for the MM and DFT 
calculations.

 3. Results and discussion  
 The results of the expe riments are discussed in several sections. Halloysite 
characteristics will be presented first, followed by the results obtained in the study of 
adsorption kinetics. Interactions of the two components are discussed next followed by 
considerations about  the possible location of quercetin on or within the halloysite. The 
surface structure of coated halloysite is considered subsequently including possible 
consequences for practice.  
 
3.1. Halloysite characteristics  
 The use of halloysite nanotubes both as controlled release support and as adsorbent 
requires their thorough characterization. Competitive  interactions determine the amount of 
released material, the optimum and/or maximum amount of active component used for  
coating , and the rate of release. The surface energy of the mineral determines the strength 
of interaction, while its specific surface area as well as pore volume the adsorbed amount. 
However, halloysite nanotubes are rarely characterized in detail and ma ny of the 
characteristics mentioned above are never determined. FTIR or UV -VIS spectroscopy are 
often used to follow the adsorption of a certain molecule  [2, 11, 14], TEM to demonstrate 
tubular structure  [2, 13], zeta potential, pH [2, 5] are determined oc casionally , but specific 
surface area  and pore volume  [2] are rarely measured , and practically no attempt is made to 
determine surface energy.  
 Because of the high energy of their surface, halloysite nanotubes are expected to 
aggregate.  These aggregates  could be separated reasonably well by ultrasonic treatment. 
Particle size analysis of the mineral indicated an average particle size of 6.5 m. The tubular 
structure of the anisotropic particles is clearly shown by TEM. The dimensions of the tubes 
were det ermined by image analysis from the micrographs recorded and they cover ed a wide 9 
 range. Their average length is 203  119 nm, outer diameter 50  23 and external diameter 
15  6 nm.  
 Besides particle characteristics, the surface area and pore structure are  also very 
important for the intended application. According to the nitrogen adsorption measurements 
the specific surface area of the mineral is 57 m2/g. A surface area was calculated also from 
the average dimensions of the tubes and 49 m2/g was obtained in this way. The good 
agreement of the two values indicates the accessibility of the total surface area, at least by 
nitrogen. BET measurements yielded  the total pore volume (0.181 cm3/g) and the volume 
of the micropores ( 0.023 cm3/g) of halloysite  as well . The volume inside the tubes was 
calculated also from tube geometry and a value of 0.039 g/cm3 was obtained. This value is 
close to that of the pores and might determine the amount of the active molecules which can 
be adsorbed by halloysite, at least if th e majority of the compound is loaded within the tubes.  
 Layered silicates often can accommodate quest molecules among their layers. Good 
examples are montmorillonites and layered double hydroxides  [4, 35]. Accordingly, the 
theoretical possibility exists th at halloysite can also adsorb quercetin within its layered 
structure. The layer distance of our mineral determined by XRD is 0.7 nm, somewhat 
smaller than that of montmorillonite which is around 1 nm. Although halloysite is regarded 
as a non -swelling clay,  some sources claim the intercalation of urea [36, 37] and small 
molecular weight substances within the layers [ 38]. 
 IGC yielded 278 mJ/m2 for the dispersion component of surface tension and >1000 
mJ/m2 for its polar component. This latter number must be treated with the utmost care 
because of the technical difficulties involved in their determination. The composition and 
structure of the external and in ternal surfaces of halloysite is  dissimilar, the in ternal surface 
is very similar to gibbsite , while the external one consists of silicon dioxide. Infinite dilution 
IGC measures the energy of the most active sites and the values do not give information 10 
 about the overall energy of the two surfaces. Dissolut ion measurements indicated an 
energetically heterogeneous surface  [28], which allows for the preferential adsorption of 
active molecules on either side. Only additional experiments may decide the question and 
give information about the location of quercetin on or inside the halloysite tubes.  
 
3.2. Adsorption  
  Quercetin was adsorbed onto the surface of halloysite from ethanol solution. Under 
such conditions adsorption is a competitive process, both the active molecule and the solvent 
competes for ac tive sites on the surface of the mineral. Quercetin has multiple –OH groups 
which can interact with the surface, but ethano l is also expected to form strong secondary 
bonds or H -bridges with it. The amount of adsorbed quercetin is plotted against the 
conce ntration of the added quercetin  in Fig. 1 . The most active sites are occupied first; the 
amount of bonded quercetin increases linearly with the amount of added quercetin  and 
practically all antioxidant  molecules  adsorb on the surface of the mineral. Adsorp tion 
continues with increasing concentration at larger quercetin am ounts as well, but with a 
smaller  slope. The change in slope indicates an energetically heterogeneous surface and 
possible multilayer coverage.  
 The time dependence, i.e. the kinetics, of a dsorption is presented in Fig. 2. In 
agreement with the conclusion drawn in the previous paragraph, adsorption is fast initially 
and slows down later. At small solution concentrations the adsorption isotherm goes to 
saturation, but increases continuously a t larger concentrations. This kinetics was observed 
above 2 wt% quercetin content, i.e. at 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 wt%. In the case of simple 
physisorption one would expect a simple correlation going towards saturation  just like in 
our case at or below 2 wt % quercetin content (see Fig. 2). Such a behavior was observed 
practically by all the groups using halloysite as a n adsorber  for compounds [ 17, 18, 39-42]. 11 
 However, both the concentration of the active component in the solution and the amount of 
halloysite  in the slurry was smaller  in the reported cases  than in our s. Solution 
concentrations ranged between 0.03  and 0.3 g/d m3 with the most frequent value of 0.05 
g/dm3 or less  [17, 18, 39, 42], while halloysite content changed between 1 and 8 g/dm3 with 
the us ual value of 1 g/dm3 [17, 18, 39, 42]. In our experiments the corresponding 
concentrations of the solutions were 0.0 3-2.00 g/dm3 and uniformly 10 g/dm3 for the 
suspension. Moreover, most of the kinetic studies were carried out in water solution  
previously . We may safely assume and the results strongly support the explanation that the 
considerable polarity of our active molecule, its relatively small solubility in ethanol, the 
large concentration s used and the energetically heterogeneous surface of halloysi te lead to 
the observed unusual adsorption kinetics and to multilayer c overage.  
 
3.3. Interactions  
 The adsorption isotherms presented above prove that  quercetin molecules adsorb on 
the high energy surface of halloysite. The amount adsorbed is determined b y competitive 
processes, by the relative strength of competing specific interactions. The competition is 
demonstrated well by Fig. 3  comparing the amount of quercetin adsorbed from solution and 
that remaining on the surface after a dissolution process [ 28]. In this latter, the surface of 
the mineral is coated with increasing amounts of the active molecule and then the surplus, 
non-bonded compound is dissolved with an appropriate solvent, ethanol in this case. The 
comparison of the two correlations show that  larger amount remains on the surface in the 
dissolution experiment than adsorbs  from solution. In the latter case quercetin and solvent 
molecules compete for active sites and the adsorption of the solvent prevents that of the 
probe molecule. All active si tes are occupied by quercetin molecules in the dissolution 
experiment and strong interaction with the surface prevent their dissolution and replacement 12 
 by the solvent.  
 Interactions are often  followed by FTIR spectroscopy [ 17, 36, 43]. The overall 
DRIFT sp ectrum of quercetin, the neat halloysite and that of some coated nanotubes are 
shown in Fig. 4 . Quite a few peaks of quercetin and the halloysite overlap with each other, 
but characteristic peaks  can be distinguished which do not interfere. The bonds assig ned to 
the surface (3698 cm-1) and lattice (3629 cm-1) –OH groups of the halloysite and the skeleton 
vibration of the aromatic rings of quercetin (1518 cm-1) were used in further analysis. In 
Fig. 5 the relative intensity of this latter is plotted against the amount of quercetin used for 
treatment. The two hydroxyl vibrations of halloysite were used as references in the 
evaluation. The non -linear correlation probably results from the simultaneous effect of the 
numerous factors (particle size, porosity, samp le preparation conditions, etc.) influencing 
the intensity of DRIFT absorption. The two sets of data agree excellently indicating that 
quercetin does not intercalate among halloysite layers. In the case of intercalation, the 
interaction of surface –OH grou ps with quercetin would result in the shift of the 
corresponding vibration and also in a decrease of its intensity as shown by several sources 
[17, 36, 43]. In spite of some claims [ 43], lattice –OH groups are not available for 
interaction. Although surfac e hydroxyl  groups are located also on the internal surface of the 
tubes and interact freely with any probe molecule, their number is small compared to the 
total number of such –OH groups and thus their interaction does not influence the position 
or intensity of the corresponding vibration.  
 The analysis of halloysite vibrations indicated the lack of intercalation, but did not 
give information about interactions. The spectra of halloysite samples coated with different 
amounts of quercetin are presented in Fig. 6 in the range of the aromatic skeleton vibration 
of the probe molecule. The comparison of the spectra clearly shows that the band shi fts 
towards larger wavenumbers with increasing coating and its  intensity increases  at the same 13 
 time. The shift exceeds 30 cm-1 wavenumber indicating stro ng interaction of the 
components. The composition dependence of the shift is shown much better in Fig. 7  in 
which the position of the vibration appearing at 1518 cm-1 in the spectrum of neat quercetin 
is plotted against the amount of the active molecule us ed for treatment. The S shaped 
correlation show s a threshold or critical concentration and decreasing shift with increasing 
coating. We may safely assume that the band shifts considerably  as an effect of interaction 
with the active sites of the highest ene rgy, but less and less as the strength of interaction 
decreases and a multilayer forms. The results  presented here  corroborate those obtained in 
the adsorption and dissolution experiments indicating the existence of an energetically 
heterogeneous halloysit e surface, strong interactions and multilayer coverage.  
 
3.4. Location  
 Controlled release from  devices containing  nanotubes is based on the assumption 
that the probe molecules are located inside the tubes and they diffuse slowly into the 
surrounding medium. Unfortunately very few evidence is presented in the literature which 
unambiguously confirms this assumption. Several possibilities exist  for the location of the 
probe molecule , it can be located on the external or internal surfaces, on both of them , or it 
can be even intercalated into the interlamellar space.  
 Several papers show that in spite of the fac t that halloysite is a non -swelling clay, 
small molecules can enter the interl amellar space. Inorganic salts, alcohols, DMSO, 
formamide, acetamide [38] etc. were shown to intercalate into halloysite, but molecules 
much larger than water and compounds with benzene rig s cannot penetrate among the 
lamellae. The analysis of FTIR spectra indicated the absence of intercalation ( Fig. 5 ). The 
penetration of molecules into the interlamellar space results in an increase of interlayer 
distance, which can be monitored by X -ray diffraction. Several XRD patterns are presented 14 
 in Fig. 8 . The characteristic reflection of halloysite at 12° 2  angle does not shift at a ll 
confirming our earlier conclusion about the lack of intercalation. Accordingly, quercetin 
must be adsorbed on either or both surfaces of the halloysite nanotubes.  
 Because of its large penetration depth ( ~10 m), FTIR spectroscopy cannot 
differentiate between the external and internal surfaces of halloysite. XPS, on the other hand, 
has escape  depth of a few nanometers  (<10 nm) thus it probes only the external surface of 
the mineral. Apart from contaminations, hal loysite does not contain carbon atoms thus the 
determination of the intensity of the C1s peak  at 285 eV in the XPS spectrum allows us to 
follow the adsorption of quercetin. The carbon content  of the samples is  plotted against the 
amount of quercetin used f or treatment in Fig. 9 . The expected increase in carbon content  
can be clearly seen in the figure.  A very similar correlation is obtained as in Fig. 7, but for 
a different reason. At small quercetin contents only the surface contamination is seen, the 
amou nt of quercetin is small and does not increase with increasing coverage. Apparently, 
quercetin is located inside the tubes until a critical concentration is reached, at which the 
tubes are saturated and the active molecule s appear also on the external surface. The 
saturation tendency observed is a result of multilayer coverage, saturation is reached when 
the thickness of the layer equals or exceeds escape depth . The results and considerations 
presented above clearly  show tha t quercetin does not penetrate the interlayer space, but at 
small  coverage it is located within the tubes and then appears also on the external surface. 
This result also implies that surface energy is larger inside the tubes than outside that 
supports our conclusion about the energetically heterogeneous surface and explains the 
characteristics of quercetin adsorption from solution.  
 
3.5. Surface structure, consequences  
  The final issue s to be considered are the arrangement of quercetin molecules on the 15 
 surface of halloysite, critical concentrations and consequences for practice. Surfactants were 
shown to arrange on the surface of clays in different ways depending on their molecular 
structure and surface coverage [ 35, 44]. At small surface coverage the molec ules orientate 
parallel to the surface, while arrange vertically at larger amounts. Quercetin is a fairly planar 
molecule (see Scheme 1 ) with a considerable number of evenly distributed functional 
groups thus we expect it to orientate parallel to the surfa ce. Preliminary molecular modelling 
confirmed the assumption and yielded the arrangement shown in Fig. 1 0. Maybe not very 
easy to see, but quercetin is attached to the surface at several points simultaneously. During 
the geometry optimizations all the perp endicular structures turned to parallel position, and 
energetically deeper complexes were obtained if quercetin was placed on the proton -rich 
(AlO x(OH) y) side of the crystal . Consequently, the results of the theoretical in vestigations 
indicate  that the ad sorption of the quercetin molecule is favored on the Al Ox(OH) y side of 
the crystal inside  the tubes and in a parallel position to the surface . 
 Characteristic concentrations can be derived from the various measurements. The 
amount of quercetin needed for c omplete coverage can be obtained from the FTIR 
measurements (see Fig. 7) and the value obtained is 4.5 wt%. XPS detects the filling of the 
tubes and the appearance of quercetin on the external surface of the nanotubes; the 
corresponding concentration is 3. 5 wt%. Earlier dissolution measurements yielded the 
irreversibly bonded quercetin (0.8 wt%) and the maximum amount which cannot be 
dissolved from the surface with ethanol (4.0 wt%)  [28]. Finally, the calculation of the 
volume occupied by quercetin  from  the density of the antioxidant allowed the estimation of 
the amount necessary to fill the pores, i.e. the voids inside the tubes and the value obtained 
was 4.1 wt%. The agreement of all the se values is surprisingly good indicating a critical 
concentration  of around 4.0 wt%. Below this value quercetin is located mostly inside the 
halloysite tubes and it is strongly bonded to the surface. As a consequence, its dissolution 16 
 or diffusion into the very apolar PE matrix is not probable, stabilization and controll ed 
release effect cannot be expected. This conclusion was already partially confirmed by 
preliminary stabilization experiments  [28]. Obviously, the critical concentration depends 
both on the guest molecule and the medium in question.  
 
4. Conclusions  
 In or der to check the possible use of halloysite nanotubes as a controlled release 
natural antioxidant device, the mineral was  thoroughly characterized with  various 
techniques  including the determination of  particle and tube morphology , specific surface 
area, p ore size and volume, as well as surface energy . The tubular structure of individual 
particles was confirmed and BET measurements showed a relatively larg e specific surface 
area. The  high surface energy determined by IGC predicted strong adsorption of the active 
molecules , quercetin,  on the surface of halloysite and difficult release as a consequence . 
FTIR spectroscopy confirmed strong interaction, an energetically heterogeneous surface 
and the development of multilayer coverage at large loading s. FTIR and X RD experiments 
proved the complete lack of intercalation and showed that below 3.5 wt% quercetin loading 
most of the molecules are located within the tubes. Molecular modelling of the surface 
indicated th e parallel orientation of  quercetin molecules with the surface. Critical 
concentrations derived from various measurements agreed well with each other further 
confirming that up to about 4.0 wt%  loading,  quercetin is bonded very strongly to the  
halloysite surface. As a consequence, the dissolution of the act ive molecules is very difficult 
or impossible, especially into apolar media  like PE , thus neither stabilization nor controlled 
release effect can be expected below that concentration.
